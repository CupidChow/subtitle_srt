I called you all day yesterday,

but you didn't answer.

5
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:11,100
I was here,

00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,220
but you were in the medical room.

7
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,500
They're now suing me

for hitting Hon Fui-lung's son

9
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,410

10
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,260
What should I do?

11
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:24,380
Have you been to the old town?

12
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,060
Did you find the white Mercedes?

13
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,450
I did,

14
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,780
but the car

15
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:33,010

17
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:38,660
Have you spoken to him?

18
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:40,220
I couldn't find him.

19
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:42,060
He might be hiding out of fear.

20
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,200
The police

21
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:46,780
might charge you

22
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,780
with evading responsibility.

23
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,060
So if you have any other evidence

24
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,540
that could help you,

25
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,380

I'm not sure what you're afraid of,

but if you can provide leads
for solving the case

29

Does he plan to admit
to stealing the car?

Because I have faith in him.

backing you.

87

90

on this case,

even someone from the old town

94

can be a good prosecutor.

believe a rookie like me?

97
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:50,610
It's precisely because you dare

98
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,100
to set such terms as a rookie

99
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,100

191
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,890
to prove that my client stole the car

192
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:11,370
and caused the traffic accident.

193
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:13,460
Based on "in dubio pro reo",

194
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:16,060
the court would likely lean toward
presuming innocence.

195
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:17,940
But if my client

196
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,650
is willing to tell the truth
about the accident,

197
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,940
it would save judicial resources

198
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,580
and benefit
both prosecution and defence.

199
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,890
You've always insisted

200
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:26,130
that Ma San-po wasn't there.

201
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,700
Now suddenly, you claim

202
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,730
that he knows the truth.

203
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:30,010
What do you mean?

204
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:33,610
I can disclose one more thing.

205
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:35,850
The clash

206
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:37,610
might not have been an accident.

207
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:40,490
So you mean

208
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:41,850
it was an intentional assault?

209
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,460
I won't rule out that possibility.

210
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:53,060
This is my client's request.

211
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,130
If you agree,

212
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:55,130
he'll talk.

213
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:01,730
Canada, huh?

214
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:04,180
And he wants his whole family there

215
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,530
and demands living expenses.

216
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:08,370
Chi Cheung-wing's power

217
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:09,940
has long dominated the old town.

218
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:12,490
No one has ever dared to come forward
to turn state's evidence.

219
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:14,460
They fear cooperating with the police.

220
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,650
It's their tradition.

221
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:17,650
Ms. Tong should know this well.

222
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:19,490
He's just a car thief.

223
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:21,060
What could he possibly know?

224
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,250
Ma San-po grew up in the old town.

225
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:26,650
He's one of Chi Cheung-wing's people.

226
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,300
Excuse me.

227
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:30,220
Ms. Chow, right?

228
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:32,890
From what you've said,

229
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:34,850
you seem quite familiar
with the old town.

230
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:38,220
Then do you know

231
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,220
how to differentiate
people from the old town

232
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,010
and Chi Cheung-wing's people?

233
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,650
This case

234
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:45,530
is the first you've taken on
independently,

235
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:46,130
right?

236
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:48,460
I admire your courage.

237
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:51,220
But you can't be so greedy.

238
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:54,180
Are you questioning my ability

239
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:55,220
just because I'm new?

240
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:57,620
As a lawyer, you can't be that hasty.

241
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:58,700
Don't bite off more than you can chew.

242
00:12:58,700 --> 00:12:59,500
Or you'll choke on it.

243
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,380
You're also from the old town.

244
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:02,180
- What?
- You...

245
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:03,660
What are you talking about?

246
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,380
Who told you I was from the old town?

247
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:10,580
Aren't you...?

248
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:11,940
Mr. Cheung grew up overseas.

249
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:13,660
He only returned after university.

250
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:16,220
My identity shouldn't be

251
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:17,300
part of this negotiation.

252
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,300
I don't think there's any need
to continue this discussion.

253
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:24,580
Ms. Chow Lok-man, right?

254
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:29,620
I'm sorry.

255
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:33,500
I'll see her out.

256
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:58,260
Hello, how did it go?

257
00:13:59,060 --> 00:13:59,940
I'm done.

258
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:02,060
Mr. Cheung isn't from the old town.

259
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:03,380
That can't be right.

260
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:04,460
You've seen his file too.

261
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:05,340
His parents

262
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:06,500
both came from the old town.

263
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:07,740
What happened?

264
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:10,700
He's very sensitive
about the words "old town".

265
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:12,420
He wouldn't let me continue.

266
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,420
Don't worry. There must be a way.

267
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:16,340
The old town...

268
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:18,180
You don't know how many years I spent

269
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:19,420
trying to shed that label.

270
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:22,140
Don't bother with a rookie.

271
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:25,300
Turning state's evidence

272
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:27,020
and demanding his family
immigrate abroad?

273
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:28,100
Where does he get the confidence

274
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,220
to make such demands?

275
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:31,420
We'll prosecute
under the original charge.

276
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:32,300
Mr. Cheung.

277
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:35,380
Please check this report first.

278
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:36,460
What's this?

279
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:38,220
A DNA report

280
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:39,060
from the crime scene.

281
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:40,860
At this point?

282
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:42,700
I just received it myself.

283
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:44,900
I was going to show it to you
as soon as you came.

284
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:46,300
But Ms. Chow

285
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:47,300
arrived early.

286
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:48,980
There are

287
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:50,580
two DNA samples.

288
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:51,500
They match.

289
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,860
One came from the vomit on the ground.

290
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:54,780
The other

291
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:57,060
was on an asthma inhaler.

292
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:59,420
Presumably from the real culprit.

293
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:01,940
They must have been so nervous

294
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:02,780
at the time of the crime

295
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:03,540
that they vomited.

296
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:04,220
Hold on.

297
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:08,700
It doesn't match

298
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:09,420
Ma San-po's DNA?

299
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:13,060
We really may have the wrong person.

300
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:14,700
And we

301
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:16,300
have no reason to keep detaining him.

302
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:17,940
Ms. Chow

303
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:19,660
doesn't know about this yet.

304
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:21,340
Only we know.

305
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:26,780
He even mocked me for being greedy

306
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:28,380
in front of Ms. Tong.

307
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:29,860
Don't you think
he's just pulling rank on me?

308
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:31,260
Undermining your confidence

309
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:32,660
is a tactic they often use.

310
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:34,580
Did you state your terms?

311
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:35,900
Did they respond?

312
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:36,940
What's the bottom line?

313
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:38,580
They didn't mention any.

314
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:40,420
Mr. Cheung rejected it outright.

315
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,100
This means Ma San-po
will remain in custody.

316
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:44,980
Give me a second.

317
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,380
Ms. Tong just texted me,

318
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:53,900
asking me to go back
and continue the negotiation.

319
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:55,300
Did she say why?

320
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:56,660
No.

321
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:57,900
Remember,

322
00:15:58,220 --> 00:15:59,980
unless they accept every term,

323
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:00,900
there's no deal.

324
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:02,220
Hold your ground.

325
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:04,620
Understood.

326
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:15,460
Ms. Chow,

327
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:17,300
you did somewhat

328
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:18,420
go off-topic.

329
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,140
But Mr. Cheung

330
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:21,060
showed understanding

331
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:22,900
and agreed to give your client
another chance.

332
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:24,900
I see.

333
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:27,420
Sorry about earlier.

334
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:28,460
That's fine.

335
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,300
Ma San-po's requests can be discussed.

336
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:33,180
But there is a prerequisite.

337
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,820
I must know

338
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:36,540
how credible

339
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:38,500
the truth he claims he'll reveal is

340
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:40,620
and who exactly committed
the intentional assault.

341
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,420
Because he's never mentioned that.

342
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:45,220
I need my client's consent

343
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:46,260
before I can answer you.

344
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:49,180
You can call him right now.

345
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:53,580
I've got my phone.

346
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,300
What do you think?

347
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:04,180
I believe there's someone behind her

348
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:05,500
coaching her on this.

349
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:07,940
This doesn't seem like a trick

350
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:09,060
that a rookie like her could pull off.

351
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:11,580
Then let's see how capable she is

352
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:12,900
and what game she can play.

353
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:23,260
How did it go?

354
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:25,380
They want to know
who the real culprit is.

355
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:27,580
That's your trump card.

356
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:28,660
Reveal it too soon,

357
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:30,100
and you'll have no leverage left.

358
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:31,700
Tell them

359
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:32,820
your client

360
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:33,500
doesn't agree.

361
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:35,820
Got it.

362
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:51,140
My client

363
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,220
doesn't agree.

364
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:58,500
If I'm allowed to visit him in custody,

365
00:17:58,500 --> 00:17:59,780
I can persuade him to agree.

366
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,700
You have one day.

367
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:12,820
We'll meet here same time tomorrow.

368
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:15,820
I have one more request.

369
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:16,940
What now?

370
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:18,620
I'll apply to the court

371
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:20,020
to allow my client to return home

372
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:21,900
and to be kept
under house detention by the police.

373
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:24,140
Even though you said
it's dangerous outside,

374
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:25,660
it's not safe in custody either.

375
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:27,780
My client wants to go home

376
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:28,820
and see his family.

377
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,620
Only if I meet this condition

378
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:32,300
will I have the confidence
to persuade him.

379
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:33,900
Meanwhile,

380
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:35,580
I'll need Mr. Cheung

381
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:36,820
to support my application in court.

382
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:46,460
Then I'll go prepare

383
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:47,620
the documents for the court.

384
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:49,700
Thank you.

385
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:59,220
This is the only chance
to uncover the real culprit

386
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:02,060
and stop the two gangs
from going to war.

387
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:05,380
If you don't mind...

388
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:08,860
Not a problem for me.

389
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:11,700
It's just following the procedure.

390
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:13,740
Thank you, Mr. Cheung.

391
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:14,380
Okay.

392
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:46,500
Didn't you finish your day?

393
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,500
Why are you back?

394
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:49,020
Do you have a minute?

395
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:50,660
About counseling...

396
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:52,020
They can't help me.

397
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:54,220
I'm sorry.

398
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:55,780
I really can't help you either.

399
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:56,780
Madam...

400
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:01,020
I know the drinking incident

401
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:02,020
caused you trouble.

402
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:03,740
But I'm really grateful

403
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:05,660
that you were with me at the time.

404
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:10,980
This is for you.

405
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:14,820
Consider it my apology.

406
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:16,060
That's unnecessary.

407
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:17,980
Just look after yourself.

408
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:18,740
Hey...

409
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:19,540
Chun Yat-wai!

410
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:31,900
Chi Cheung-wing knows
I gave money to Po's family.

411
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:34,020
He's holding this against me.

412
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:37,180
He even threatened me
with my wife and kids,

413
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,500
asking me to help him
steal a shipment of weapons.

414
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:42,900
You didn't agree to that, did you?

415
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:44,660
Do I have a choice?

416
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:46,500
Is there really no other option?

417
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:53,740
We've got a bigger problem.

418
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:55,580
Po

419
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:57,020
is going to turn state's evidence.

420
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:00,020
Who told you that?

421
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:02,260
Ms. Chow says Po hasn't confirmed yet.

422
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,660
But the moment he starts talking,

423
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:06,180
he'll finger you and me.

424
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:11,260
You have one night

425
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:13,020
to persuade Po to change his mind.

426
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:18,060
He's in solitary detention.

427
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:19,820
I can't even see him.

428
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:20,820
How can I persuade him?

429
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:23,820
They'll soon release him

430
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:25,660
and keep him under house arrest.

431
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,140
The prosecution and the court

432
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:28,980
will both approve it.

433
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:30,260
Tonight

434
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:31,500
is our last chance.

435
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:37,100
I'll discuss with my wife
back home first.

436
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:40,100
We're already in deep trouble.

437
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:41,700
Don't involve her any further.

438
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:45,900
So what should I do?

439
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:50,700
If you do see him,

440
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:51,900
tell him

441
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:53,660
the police don't actually have

442
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:54,900
much evidence.

443
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:56,940
As long as he gets through this,

444
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:57,900
I'll think of a way.

445
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:00,340
Ask him

446
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:01,860
to tell Ms. Chow

447
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:03,620
that he's changed his mind

448
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:05,220
and that he will persist
in staying silent.

449
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:09,100
Ultimately,

450
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:11,660
you're just afraid
something will happen to you.

451
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:15,780
What would I be afraid of?

452
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:18,340
I don't want to give up Yat-wai.

453
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:21,020
Even if the police really come,

454
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:22,420
they won't take Yat-wai away.

455
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:24,140
I won't let him go to jail.

456
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:26,140
Are you running away like this?

457
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:27,740
Is this how you treat your friend?

458
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,140
If I didn't consider you a friend,

459
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:30,740
I wouldn't have asked you
to reach out to Po.

460
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:32,740
I'm doing this for you and for everyone.

461
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:34,380
Whether we should run away...

462
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:39,500
depends on whether you can
get Po to shut up.

463
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:55,420
You can go home tonight.

464
00:22:59,140 --> 00:22:59,660
Really?

465
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:02,220
The police will keep you
under house arrest.

466
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:04,500
But at least you can go home

467
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:06,700
and see your mother and siblings.

468
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:11,140
Their condition is...

469
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:13,100
To reveal who the real culprit is.

470
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:14,700
Then...

471
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:16,180
what about my request?

472
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:17,460
What about money?

473
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:19,300
Where will my family go?

474
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:20,740
Naming the real culprit

475
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:21,780
is the prerequisite.

476
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:23,860
The truth must be persuasive enough

477
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:25,860
for them to act on
the witness protection program.

478
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:29,820
How about this?

479
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:31,300
I'll give you one night to think.

480
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:32,780
When you get home,

481
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:34,340
you can discuss it with your mother.

482
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:41,980
Can I really

483
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:44,500
go home tonight?

484
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:48,420
But the deadline is

485
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:50,140
tomorrow at 9 AM.

486
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,300
You must give the real culprit's name
by then.

487
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:54,660
Otherwise, they'll immediately
arrest you back here.

488
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:56,900
And there won't be
any witness protection program anymore.

489
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:58,940
Because they'll decide
you can't be trusted.

490
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:41,380
Mom!

491
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:43,180
Po's back.

492
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:44,300
He is?

493
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:48,940
Po's back.

494
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:50,540
Look. Po's back.

495
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:52,220
Po's back.

496
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:54,860
Can we remove the handcuffs?

497
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:56,300
Don't let his younger siblings see.

498
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:57,900
Po.

499
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:58,460
Uncuff him.

500
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:04,300
I will

501
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:04,940
keep my word.

502
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:06,940
I hope you do too.

503
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:08,460
Po's back!

504
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:11,900
Po.

505
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:12,660
Po!

506
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:13,980
I'm back!

507
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:15,300
You're back.

508
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:16,460
Po's back.

509
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:17,100
Mom, I'm back.

510
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:17,940
Great!

511
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:21,660
Did you miss me?

512
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:23,460
Po.

513
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:24,420
Give her a hug.

514
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:25,340
Po.

515
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:26,420
You've grown heavier.

516
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:33,100
So good to see you, Po.

517
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:33,940
Let's get in.

518
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:34,900
Po.

519
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:37,220
Po, so good you're back.

520
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:37,860
Missed me?

521
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:39,460
As long as you're back.

522
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:56,580
Dad.

523
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:57,500
Hey,

524
00:25:58,260 --> 00:25:59,740
why can't I find your passport anywhere?

525
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:01,180
What are you going to do?

526
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:02,660
Book a flight.

527
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:05,700
What happened?

528
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:14,260
Fly!

529
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:15,100
Dinner's ready.

530
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:16,660
Again!

531
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:19,660
Po, time to eat.

532
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:21,660
Let's eat.

533
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:22,460
Come on.

534
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:23,380
Eat.

535
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:24,540
Thanks, Mom.

536
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:26,020
Po.

537
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:29,180
Come on, Po.

538
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:30,460
Eat more.

539
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:31,820
Po, you eat.

540
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:32,380
Okay.

541
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:33,100
You eat.

542
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:34,540
Thank you.

543
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:43,060
It's good.

544
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:45,060
- Yeah.
- Tasty.

545
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:45,940
Since you're here,

546
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:46,900
why not go in?

547
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:50,980
Fair.

548
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:54,020
Even if you do,
my mom will throw you out.

549
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:57,260
Little brat, you have no manners.

550
00:27:57,780 --> 00:27:59,660
When you had me do dirty work,

551
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:01,260
did you think of me like a kid?

552
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:15,580
I dragged you in.

553
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:19,300
I never thought
it would turn out this way.

554
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:22,060
But now you're showing up with cops.

555
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:24,180
What will people here think of you?

556
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:25,100
There is no "will".

557
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:27,420
I'm leaving.

558
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:30,100
What about your mom

559
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:31,900
and your siblings?

560
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:33,700
We'll go together.

561
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:37,460
I must not go to prison.

562
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:41,580
Or Hon Fui-lung's people will kill me.

563
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:45,500
What deal did you offer the cops?

564
00:28:58,300 --> 00:28:58,780
Hello?

565
00:28:59,460 --> 00:28:59,860
Wai,

566
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:01,180
how's it going?

567
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:02,420
I'm not sure.

568
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:04,500
Po refuses to say a word.

569
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:08,700
Dad.

570
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:09,940
The passport.

571
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:12,220
Are we really going?

572
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:16,500
You make all the decisions alone.

573
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:17,740
Don't I have a choice?

574
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:18,700
Not this time.

575
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:21,020
We're setting off in an hour.

576
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:22,420
Pack your things.

577
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:22,980
Go.

578
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:29,780
That scum judge?

579
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:32,140
Po.

580
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:36,740
You know how much the police dislike

581
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:37,860
people from the old town.

582
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:39,780
Do you still remember

583
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:42,300
how they ruined my career as a cop?

584
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:43,940
Do you really think

585
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:46,620
they truly want you
to turn state's witness?

586
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:50,900
Trust me.

587
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:52,820
I'll find a way to help you.

588
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:55,500
If they catch me too,

589
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:57,740
both our families are finished.

590
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:03,980
So sacrificing just me

591
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:06,500
is worth it?

592
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:13,380
So tired.

593
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:18,540
I haven't slept well a single night

594
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:20,260
in the detention center.

595
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:31,780
Have you told Grandma

596
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:32,820
we're going to Canada?

597
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:34,860
We'll tell her when we arrive.

598
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:37,300
Why so sudden?

599
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:39,980
Master,

600
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:42,580
Ma Sha-po just texted me.

601
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:45,100
He asked me to prepare
all the documents tomorrow.

602
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:46,220
I think

603
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:48,420
he's ready to name the real culprit.

604
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:54,940
That's great.

605
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:56,180
I didn't expect

606
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:58,020
we could really pull this off.

607
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:00,700
Thank you, Master.

608
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:03,180
Okay, keep it up.

609
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:11,580
Travel agency?

610
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:14,060
Just think of it as a trip.

611
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:15,580
It's so late.

612
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:16,860
It's obvious we're running away.

613
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:18,620
Yes, we're on the run.

614
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:19,380
It is obvious,

615
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:19,860
okay?

616
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:25,420
Then how am I supposed to go to class?

617
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:26,780
You still have work.

618
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:28,620
I'll sort things out.

619
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:30,180
You always do things on your own.

620
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:32,100
You don't tell me anything.

621
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:34,500
Back then, you didn't discuss it
with Mom either.

622
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:37,420
Yat-wai.

623
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:40,300
For over half a year,

624
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:41,900
I've never really sat down

625
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:43,340
to talk with you

626
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:44,500
about your mom.

627
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:47,460
She was the one I loved most.

628
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:50,860
I never would have thought

629
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:53,180
that she would choose
to leave me that way.

630
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:57,620
Perhaps

631
00:31:58,260 --> 00:31:59,740
this is a trial for us.

632
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:02,900
Now it's just the two of us.

633
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:05,740
We must stand united.

634
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:07,820
Stop doubting me

635
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:08,940
and questioning me,

636
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:10,140
can you?

637
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:14,500
Are we never going to come back?

638
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:26,020
Yat-wai.

639
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:28,300
Stop bringing up Mom!

640
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:30,300
Why have you changed like this?

641
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:32,580
Ever since you wouldn't let me
turn myself in.

642
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:33,260
No,

643
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:34,940
it was you who hit a person
with the car and ran.

644
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:35,700
Now the police are after you.

645
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:36,900
Then let them!

646
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:38,100
Yat-wai!

647
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:42,020
Yat-wai!

648
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:24,060
Wai,

649
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:25,300
what happened?

650
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:27,540
What's going on?

651
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:29,540
Where's your dad?

652
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:39,260
I knew something was wrong.

653
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:41,420
Neither of you
is willing to say anything.

654
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:42,140
Grandma,

655
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:45,100
can I have a rest first?

656
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:47,060
Please don't ask me now.

657
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:49,300
Okay, I won't ask.

658
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:50,420
I won't ask you anything.

659
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:51,500
Come on, let's get inside.

660
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:53,700
Don't be afraid. I'm here.

661
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:55,540
You're always welcome here.

662
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:56,060
Come on.

663
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:02,340
Ma San-po

664
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:04,020
is ready to reveal the real culprit.

665
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:09,500
Ma San-po.

666
00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:12,500
I'm sorry.

667
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:14,860
I don't want to get you killed.

668
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:16,780
I just want to save my son.

669
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:27,300
We've received word.

670
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:28,540
It's the same person again.

671
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:33,900
He said the one who hit Mr. Hon Gong

672
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:35,580
was called Ma San-po.

673
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:36,900
He lives in the old town.

674
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:38,420
Now

675
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:40,220
he's under police protection.

676
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:16,220
Chun Yue,

677
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:18,100
what were you doing?

678
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:19,420
You didn't answer my calls,

679
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:20,620
and you weren't at home.

680
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:23,380
Did Yat-wai go to your place?

681
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:25,020
He is here with me.

682
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:26,700
What happened between you two?

683
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:27,260
You know,

684
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:29,620
I asked him,
but he wouldn't say anything.

685
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:31,900
Remember,

686
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:33,500
don't let him leave the house.

687
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:35,740
I'll pick him up tomorrow.

688
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:37,500
Can you stop acting this way?

689
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:39,420
You keep everything from me.

690
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:40,820
When things get serious,

691
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:42,700
I won't be able to help you.

692
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:44,300
I'm telling you,

693
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:46,100
I won't let what happened to Lam

694
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:47,180
happen again.

695
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:49,700
Tomorrow.

696
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:52,180
I'll tell you everything

697
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:53,020
tomorrow.

698
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:56,100
Just remember, don't let Yat-wai leave.

699
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:00,060
He's fallen asleep.

700
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:01,580
Then see you tomorrow.

701
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:05,540
Uncle.

702
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:09,700
Uncle.

703
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:12,860
Go back.

704
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:26,020
Po.

705
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:28,900
I won't blame you for this.

706
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:30,820
You were innocent from the start.

707
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:32,460
You'll be fine.

708
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:38,300
I have one favor to ask.

709
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:42,300
Please look after your aunt

710
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:44,260
- and your cousins for me.
- Uncle.

711
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:48,900
I won't turn you in.

712
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:51,300
What?

713
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:57,420
I'll give them a name,

714
00:37:58,100 --> 00:37:59,700
the name of a thug in the old town.

715
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:01,260
Then

716
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:02,860
my mom, siblings, and I

717
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:03,780
will leave here,

718
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:05,300
so we won't have to worry
that they'll take revenge.

719
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:07,260
You're going to trick them?

720
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:08,380
Will that work?

721
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:10,980
Ms. Chow said they've accepted.

722
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:13,420
As long as I give them
a name before nine,

723
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:15,380
the witness protection program
will start.

724
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:16,780
At that time,

725
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:18,900
our whole family can leave here.

726
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:02,300
Hello?

727
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:03,340
Master,

728
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:04,900
I couldn't reach your phone.

729
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:07,020
I'm all set and ready to go.

730
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:08,580
Wish me good luck.

731
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:09,460
Okay.

732
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:11,660
Be careful.

733
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:25,580
Please leave a message.

734
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:27,300
Mr. Chun,

735
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:29,500
Po won't say anything.

736
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:31,140
Rest assured, everything's fine now.

737
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:51,140
Come here.

738
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:53,300
Mom, I want to play with this.

739
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:54,100
Okay.

740
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:55,700
The shirt got dirty again.

741
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:56,500
Help me with it.

742
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:57,780
Please clean it for me.

743
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:00,340
All right.

744
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,420
Let me play with it.

745
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:04,940
Suet,

746
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:07,300
we bought breakfast.

747
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:12,660
Where is Po?

748
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:14,220
Let's not play here.

749
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:20,540
Come on, eat something.

750
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:27,500
Come and have breakfast.

751
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:29,180
Come here.

752
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:32,500
Let's eat.

753
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:33,500
Let's have breakfast.

754
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:35,220
Put it here.

755
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:54,260
Here, try this.

756
00:40:57,980 --> 00:40:59,260
Didn't the lawyer say she'd come?

757
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:01,860
She said last night
she'd come this morning.

758
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:02,780
She should be here soon.

759
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:06,300
I'll get them some.

760
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:06,940
Let me do it.

761
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:08,420
They should feel more reassured

762
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:09,420
knowing I didn't escape.

763
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:14,460
Here.

764
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:17,100
Eat.

765
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:20,300
Have some congee.

766
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:29,900
Here.

767
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:30,380
Thanks.

768
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:31,540
Here.

769
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:45,900
Watch out!

770
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:52,900
Keep them safe!

771
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:12,700
We can't hold on! Run!

772
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:35,860
Keep them safe.

773
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:39,780
Po!

774
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:41,900

Don't do this to me, Po.

786
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:13,780
