I believe

111
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,700
there are three major doubts
in this case.

112
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,170
First,

113
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:49,100
the package

was not recovered
from the defendant's home.

Otherwise, the packaging

in so many weeds and silts.

121
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,490
the defendant

122
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:07,490

to acts he did not commit,

127
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,460
it is evident

128
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:21,810

If you turn yourself in now,

358
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,490
considering you only have
a learner's permit,

362
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,090
That's a good reason.

363

Besides, you have no
prior criminal record.

364

a lighter sentence.

00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,900
you won't even get that chance.

00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,140
Will I have to go to prison?

368
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:12,180
That depends on whether the person
you hit is alive or dead.

369

Let's not worry about that.

370
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:13,770
Aren't you a judge?

371
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,010

00:19:56,590 --> 00:19:57,620
don't volunteer too much information,

377
00:19:58,270 --> 00:19:59,250
but you must tell the truth.

Don't offer extra details.

Just say

381
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:11,900
you were driving,

382
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,090
and you suddenly had an asthma attack.

383
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,770
You were scared and nervous,

384
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:17,220
and couldn't breathe properly.

385
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,330
That's why the accident happened.

386

387
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,140

00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,380
But for a judge

440
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:52,940
I think it's probably just

441
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:54,570
an ordinary car theft.

442
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:56,010

it was gone.

the vehicle inspection had expired.

467
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,010

new drivers must display an L-plate.

488
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:15,290
Is it serious?

489
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:19,050
The victim

490
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:21,770

491
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:26,290

492
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:28,940

has been getting restless.

494
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:33,530

00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:35,180
Hon Fui-lung's son, Hon Gong, to be

496
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,090
even more ruthless than his father.

497
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,290
So he hasn't gained any ground.

498

499
00:25:40,030 --> 00:25:41,090
Hon Gong being hit,

500
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:42,860
it's pretty clear

who has the most motive.

502

If these two gangs really fight,

503
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:50,620
who knows how many will die?

504
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:52,940
Is the victim's condition

505
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,140
critical?

506
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:56,330
Mr. Chun,

507
00:25:56,590 --> 00:25:57,900

508
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,140
in your hands.

509
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:00,530
You'll find out then.

510
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:01,530
Okay.

511
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,010
I told you to leave the police station.

512
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:21,010
Why are you still here?

513
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,180
The engine stalled.

514
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,050
Then an officer said

515
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:27,140
I was blocking the way.

516
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:28,730
The engine wouldn't start,

517
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:30,730
so he parked my car here.

519
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:33,900
he said I didn't have an L-plate

520
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:36,050
and took down my license plate number.

521
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:42,340
Who was that?

528
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:07,460
Will it start?

529
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:10,740
When did it stop working?

530
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:13,020
No response.

531
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:14,540
It's not the tires.

00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:18,340
Did you pop the hood?

533
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:19,500
Yeah, I checked.

534
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:36,900
Didn't you want me to turn myself in?

535
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:39,540

You can't make the call?

568
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:02,660
Then find someone who can!

569
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:03,780
Go!

570
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:10,700
This morning,

571
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:11,820
around 10 AM,

572
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:13,380
you took the bus

573
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:14,660
to school as usual.

574
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:17,780
But you suddenly

575
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:18,900
had an asthma attack.

576
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:21,660
So

577
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:23,620
you got off at the park stop.

578
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:26,260
You rested

579
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:27,180
but didn't get better.

580
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:29,660
So you went home

581
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:30,420
instead of school.

582
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:32,780
You got home

583
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:34,500
around noon

584
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:36,860
and found the car was gone.

585
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:39,740
You thought I had taken it,

586
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:40,740
so you didn't think much of it.

587
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:41,820
Actually,

588
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:43,060
it was because

589
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:44,980
the vehicle inspection had expired.

590
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:46,740
I called a court car to pick me up.

591
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:49,020
I only realized the car was missing

592
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:50,820
when I came back in the afternoon.

593
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:54,700
Remember every word I said.

594
00:29:58,140 --> 00:29:59,180
You can do this.

595
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:01,740
After I leave,

596
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:04,620
don't have contact with anyone.

597
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:05,220
Understand?

598
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:35,300
Who is it?

599
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:37,820
Wai, it's me, Chun Yue.

600
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:45,700
I didn't expect you.

601
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:48,980
Look,

602
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:51,020
I recently sold
a batch of contraband cigarettes.

603
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:52,140
Turns out they were water-damaged.

604
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:54,380
I've already paid compensation.

605
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:56,660
I'm worried they might come after me.

606
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:58,020
So I was just protecting myself.

607
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:00,940
You needed something?

608
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:03,140
Yes.

609
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:05,460
I need a favor.

610
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:06,940
Can you get rid of a car for me

611
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:08,660
as soon as possible?

612
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:13,100
Get rid of it as soon as possible?

Since I sentenced Hon Fui-lung,

615
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:22,020
I've been having troubles.

616
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:24,300
Whose car is it?

617

There are some matters
I can't be involved in directly.

618

That's why I'm asking for your help.

619

Can you do it?

620

Okay.

Wai often says

633

he has an elementary school classmate
who's a judge.

634
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:18,740

in the police force,

Mr. Chun, thankfully,

638
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:25,380
you ensured justice was served

639
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:26,860
and cleared his name.

640
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:28,660

642

The case back then

643
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:34,660
was really just dismissed
due to insufficient evidence.

644
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:36,540
I told you

645
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:39,420
he didn't help me
because we're classmates.

646
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:41,180
He just didn't want to

647
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:42,580
tarnish his reputation

648
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:44,180
for never wrongfully convicting anyone.

649
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:47,300
How can you say that?

650
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:50,460
Though Wai was eventually

651

dismissed from the force,

652

and law enforcement
