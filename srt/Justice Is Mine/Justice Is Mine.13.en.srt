00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:09,900
Do you know that the maximum sentence

574
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:11,940
for kidnapping is 15 years?

575
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:14,540
You are such a good son.

576
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:16,460
Do you want to
be in prison with your father?

577
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:19,980
15 years for kidnapping,

578
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:22,100
then how about murder?

579
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:24,900
What do you say you killed my brother?

580
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:27,140
What do you want?

581
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:29,340
Why did you kill my brother?

582
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:31,780
Do you really want an answer?

583
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:36,460
I will ask you one more time.

584
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:38,460
Why did you kill my brother?

585
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:42,300
Because he is a scumbag.

586
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:44,460
Your entire family is scumbags!

587
00:32:57,340 --> 00:32:58,260
Why?

588
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:00,140
Why?

589
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:02,220
Why did you kill my brother?

590
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:04,060
Why did you kill my brother? Why?

591
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:06,940
Tell me.

592
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:09,500
Not speaking?

593
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:11,420
Then I will kill you,

594
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:13,500
and I will kill your son!

595
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:25,380
[Aspirations unmet, Rest in Heaven]

596
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:32,260
Get up!

597
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:40,100
If I get to walk out this door alive,

598
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:42,620
I will kill you as well.

599
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:43,700
You are a noble man, huh?

600
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:45,700
You are nothing

601
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:47,660
without that court dress.

602
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:53,100
Don't shoot.

603
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:54,580
I will tell you.

604
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:55,820
I will.

605
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:00,500
Because you all deserve to die.

606
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:07,700
I will kill you
in revenge for my brother.

607
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:09,060
Okay.

608
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:10,380
If you have the guts,

609
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:11,060
shoot.

610
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:11,980
Do it!

611
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:14,180
Mr. Hon Lit,

612
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:15,940
what's the matter?

613
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:17,940
Someone is here.

614
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:18,900
You have to see him.

615
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:32,420
Watch him.

616
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:33,340
Got it.

617
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:47,820
Mr. Hon Lit,

618
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:50,420
this is

619
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:51,580
Mr. Ong Siu.

620
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:54,100
Mr. Ong,

621
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:56,340
I don't think we know each other.

622
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:57,740
What's the matter?

623
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:01,780
I'm sorry for the death of your brother.

624
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:03,580
I'm here to see how you are holding up.

625
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:05,060
Thank you for that.

626
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:07,620
Perhaps we can have a chat?

627
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:10,740
Now?

628
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:12,780
I'm kind of occupied.

629
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:22,180
Mr. Ong,

630
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:27,700
this way.

631
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:32,140
I guess you are not here
to offer your consolation.

632
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:33,460
Maybe

633
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:36,140
you can cut to the chase.

634
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:39,860
I like to talk to smart people like you.

635
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:41,220
It saves a lot of time.

636
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:43,700
I want you to spare Mr. Chun.

637
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:46,260
Hokong needs this judge

638
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:47,980
to uphold justice.

639
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:50,340
Justice?

640
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:53,340
What if I don't?

641
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:56,260
Even if Mr. Chun dies,

642
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:57,660
your brother will not come back to life.

643
00:35:58,540 --> 00:35:59,540
It's better for you

644
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:01,300
to do something meaningful.

645
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:07,340
There are some signs.

646
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:09,260
Whenever you see them, be alarmed.

647
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:11,100
Diamonds,

648
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:13,020
hearts,

649
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:15,900
and spades

650
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:18,060
are the businessmen,

651
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:19,380
police,

652
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:20,620
and politicians.

653
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:22,500
When you see them,

654
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:24,180
be careful.

655
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:26,060
They are all about interest.

656
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:35,780
I don't think

657
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:37,300
we can convince each other.

658
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:39,300
Let's not waste each other's time.

659
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:41,020
Mr. Hon Lit,

660
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:42,580
what we are wasting

661
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:44,900
is your father's time in jail.

662
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:48,460
What do you mean?

663
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:51,900
It's like a chess game.

664
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:54,860
Each piece has its own purpose.

665
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:57,020
You cannot move it at will,

666
00:36:57,820 --> 00:36:58,860
or it will

667
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:00,340
mess up the overall strategy.

668
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:03,660
It then affects the result of the game,

669
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:05,340
and finally,

670
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:07,220
the interest behind it.

671
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:09,140
You should understand, right?

672
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:16,300
Who's the one pulling the strings
in this game?

673
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:18,020
You?

674
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:21,300
I'm only a messenger.

675
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:23,060
You are saying

676
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:24,740
that my father

677
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:26,300
is only a chess piece.

678
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:27,460
That's right.

679
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:29,900
So is that judge.

680
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:31,620
He will be.

681
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:34,380
How do you know
that he will listen to you?

682
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:37,700
Everyone has a soft spot.

683
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:40,340
I'm not trying to make him obey.

684
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:41,900
It's for the greater good.

685
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:44,260
The interest of the greater

686
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:46,380
is the interest of your father
in the future.

687
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:53,100
I know my father too well.

688
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:55,220
Nothing

689
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:57,100
can compare to my brother.

690
00:37:58,340 --> 00:37:59,300
Same for me.

691
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:03,460
It's a pity, then.

692
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:05,900
A useless piece

693
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:07,100
has no value.

694
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:12,940
Just you try.

695
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:17,860
I'm only a messenger.

696
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:20,180
I've delivered the word.

697
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:22,140
It's your choice.

698
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:55,100
Mr. Chun,

699
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:57,900
Mr. Ong wants to give you a ride.

700
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:13,540
Mr. Chun.

701
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:15,020
Mr. Ong.

702
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:16,620
Get in the car.

703
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:28,580
Thank you.

704
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:36,500
How do you know where I am?

705
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:39,100
I got a message

706
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:40,140
that you were in trouble,

707
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:41,260
so I came to take a look.

708
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:45,780
After all, you are
an important figure in Hokong.

709
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:50,340
As a council member,

710
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:51,620
I'm like a bridge for communication.

711
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:53,540
I know exactly

712
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:54,500
what happened.

713
00:39:58,260 --> 00:39:59,060
Mr. Chun,

714
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:02,780
let's pretend nothing happened tonight.

715
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:05,180
I'm sure

716
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:06,780
it won't happen again, too.

717
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:16,260
I'll send you home,
and you can take a rest.

718
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:18,500
Thank you.

719
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:27,900
Why didn't you kill the judge?

720
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:30,260
Mr. Ong came,

721
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:33,060
and he asked me to let him go

722
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:34,900
for the sake of Hokong.

723
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:38,180
Did you back down just because of that?

724
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:41,900
Dad,

725
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:43,500
you said it yourself.

726
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:45,300
They are all about interest,

727
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:47,100
and interest is the biggest weapon.

728
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:48,300
Your brother...

729
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:50,220
Your brother was the only interest.

730
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:51,500
The rest is nothing!

731
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:58,620
A useless piece

732
00:40:59,060 --> 00:40:59,980
has no value.

733
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:01,860
Just you try.

734
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:05,220
I've delivered the word.

735
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:07,020
It's your choice.

736
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:10,900
Dad,

737
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:13,900
the judge will not leave
without his son.

738
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:15,780
We can kill him anytime we want,

739
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:18,420
but I won't let them

740
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:19,300
have any excuse to hurt you.

741
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:20,460
I'm not scared of them.

742
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:23,460
I don't believe they dare to harm me!

743
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:25,780
I can help them,

744
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:27,300
so I can ruin them!

745
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:29,500
Let's see who the winner is.

746
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:33,540
Father...

747
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:34,860
Alright, Lit. Stop it.

748
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:35,820
You should go.

749
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:45,420
I will definitely take revenge for Gong.

750
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:48,060
I won't let you down.

751
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:57,660
Don't get so angry.

752
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:01,820
I remember you told me

753
00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:03,620
that no one is harder to catch

754
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:05,820
than a police officer
who breaks the law.

755
00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:07,460
In that case,

756
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:08,900
it is even harder

757
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:11,020
to catch a judge

758
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:12,660
who breaks the law,

759
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:13,540
because no one

760
00:42:13,540 --> 00:42:15,820
knows the legal system better
or makes better use

761
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:17,260

770

771
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:37,100
put his ring there in advance.

772
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:38,100

773
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:39,300

00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:43,300
have nothing to learn from.

952
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:44,700
It's a new era.

953
00:49:45,380 --> 00:49:46,780
Surely, we deal with cases

954
00:49:47,180 --> 00:49:48,140
differently now.

955
00:49:48,700 --> 00:49:49,860
There is hardly right or wrong.

956
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:52,620
It's better to let it pass and move on.

957
00:49:53,460 --> 00:49:55,380
There is a Chinese saying:

958
00:49:55,380 --> 00:49:56,620
Have a definitive conclusion
on the coffin lid.

959
00:49:58,060 --> 00:49:59,140
If someone keeps digging,

960
00:49:59,540 --> 00:50:00,660
there will be some bad luck.

961
00:50:02,660 --> 00:50:03,460
Back then,

962
00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:05,820
I didn't tell you the truth

963
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:06,980
because

964
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:09,140
I received a payment.

965
00:50:10,780 --> 00:50:11,380
Well,

966
00:50:12,420 --> 00:50:13,340
who did you get it from?

967
00:50:13,660 --> 00:50:14,620
I didn't know him.

968
00:50:14,860 --> 00:50:15,540
He said

969
00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:17,300
he was only a messenger.

970
00:50:17,620 --> 00:50:18,820
After I got the money,

971
00:50:18,820 --> 00:50:19,980
I took a look outside.

972
00:50:20,380 --> 00:50:21,940
He was standing by the car,

973
00:50:22,380 --> 00:50:22,940
having a chat

974
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:24,660
with

975
00:50:24,660 --> 00:50:25,460
a tall foreigner.

976
00:50:26,380 --> 00:50:27,860
The foreigner was smoking a cigar.

977
00:50:28,140 --> 00:50:29,860
I guess he was some businessman.

978
00:50:32,580 --> 00:50:33,740
You've been a police officer

979
00:50:33,980 --> 00:50:34,780
for so many years

980
00:50:35,660 --> 00:50:37,260
with a lot of achievements.

981
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:38,340
I'm going to recommend you

982
00:50:38,340 --> 00:50:39,820
for promotion to Deputy Superintendent

983
00:50:40,180 --> 00:50:41,540
by the end of the year.
What do you think?

984
00:50:49,100 --> 00:50:50,620
In that case, Mr. Tat,

985
00:50:50,620 --> 00:50:52,260
I have to say thank you.

986
00:50:52,740 --> 00:50:54,340
Skip the pleasantries.

987
00:50:54,900 --> 00:50:55,660
From now on,

988
00:50:56,220 --> 00:50:58,580
think about the bigger picture.

989
00:50:59,060 --> 00:51:00,180
You should

990
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:01,500
leave the complicated,

991
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:02,780
meaningless cases alone,

992
00:51:03,100 --> 00:51:04,380
and I will surely

993
00:51:04,380 --> 00:51:06,380
save the spot
of Deputy Superintendent for you.

994
00:51:06,820 --> 00:51:08,300
I won't disappoint you.

995
00:51:11,140 --> 00:51:13,180
I used to suspect
that Tat Ga-ma is a bad cop.

996
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:15,100
Now I've got the answer.

997
00:51:17,140 --> 00:51:19,580
Tat Ga-ma is always
going easy on Hon Fui-lung.

998
00:51:20,460 --> 00:51:22,140
Is it possible that he is collaborating

999
00:51:22,140 --> 00:51:23,140
with Hon Fui-lung?

1000
00:51:24,100 --> 00:51:25,900
I think it is more than Hon Fui-lung.

1001
00:51:26,980 --> 00:51:28,020
There should be someone

1002
00:51:28,020 --> 00:51:29,500
higher up than Tat Ga-ma.

1003
00:51:31,220 --> 00:51:32,540
What are you going to do now?

1004
00:51:34,220 --> 00:51:35,220
Of course it's to do

1005
00:51:35,220 --> 00:51:36,140
what a cop should do.

1006
00:51:38,340 --> 00:51:39,740
Tat Ga-ma knows

1007
00:51:39,740 --> 00:51:41,580
that you are working
on the arson case again.

1008
00:51:42,540 --> 00:51:43,900
Did he send someone

1009
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:45,580
to spy on you?

1010
00:51:48,620 --> 00:51:50,620
He is still trying to buy me off,

1011
00:51:51,180 --> 00:51:52,420
which means he doesn't know

1012
00:51:52,420 --> 00:51:53,500
that I'm going to

1013
00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:54,380
investigate him next.

1014
00:51:57,380 --> 00:51:58,180
Then Lau Mao

1015
00:51:58,660 --> 00:52:00,380
will be your most powerful witness.

1016
00:52:06,780 --> 00:52:07,740
For the sake of interest,

1017
00:52:08,340 --> 00:52:09,780
how many innocent lives

1018
00:52:10,060 --> 00:52:11,460
