00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:09,940
there were too many customers yesterday.

00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:10,860
I was so swamped

8
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:11,860
that I shorted you two dollars.

9
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,090
Here, let me make it right.

10
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:14,810
It's fine.

11
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:16,260
It was two dollars short,

12
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:17,490
but not yesterday.

13
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:18,810
It was the day before yesterday.

14
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:21,650
Really?

15
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:28,330
During this period,

16
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:29,620
Chun Yue

18

19
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:33,500
Over time,

20
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:35,260
this habitual memory

21
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,860
fixed itself in Mr. Fei's mind.

22
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:38,940
So if Chun Yue

23
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,010

26
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:43,940
barely even registered it.

27
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:45,860

left the ring on purpose

30
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:50,260
just to mess with Mr. Fei's memory.

31
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:51,820
He made Mr. Fei believe

32
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,300
Chun Yue had actually been there

33
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:55,130
the day he helped him find the ring.

34
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:56,820
That ring

35
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:59,050
was actually left by Chun Yue beforehand

36
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,220

his alibi.

38
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:03,620
That theory hangs together,

39
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:05,380
but it's still

40
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:06,660
just circumstantial,

Since I'm here
to assist the investigation,

114
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:41,620
let me walk you through the logic.

115
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:43,900
Firstly,

116
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:46,500
whether Mr. Fei remembers or not,

117
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:48,700
even if I wasn't at his shop

118
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:50,420
at the time of the incident,

119
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,580
it doesn't mean
I was at the crime scene.

120
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:54,300
Secondly,

121
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:56,460
that puzzle

122
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:58,260
only shows a pair of eyes.

123
00:05:58,860 --> 00:05:59,900
Whether it looks like me or not

124
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:01,420
is subjective.

125
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:02,660
It's very abstract.

126
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:05,580
Thirdly,

127
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:07,020
the hospital

128
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:08,340
is a public place,

129
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:10,820
so why does my being there

130
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:12,460
make me a suspect?

131
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:15,060
Because there's no record

132
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:16,740
of you seeing a doctor.

133
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:19,700
I meant to,

134
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:21,340
but I didn't.

135
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:23,220
You showed up at that same hospital

136
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:24,580
three days in a row.

137
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:28,260
You just said it yourself,

138
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:29,740
that it's a public place.

139
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:31,660

144
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:38,260
That's right.

146
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:41,780
some male health problems.

147
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:44,540
I went to the hospital
three days straight,

148
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:46,140
but every time I pictured

149
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:47,260
having to tell the doctor,

150
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:48,660
I felt embarrassed,

151
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:50,660
so I walked out.

152
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:52,780
I just grabbed medicine
from the pharmacy and took it myself.

153
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:55,300
Well?

154
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:56,580
Does this help you?

155
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:58,300
But you have to remember,

00:06:58,700 --> 00:06:59,900
the burden of proof

157
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:01,220
still rests with you.

159
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:05,620
turned up at the hospital

But you kept appearing there.

163
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:11,300
Is it because

164
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:13,300
Hon Gong was alive then?

165
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:17,540
My son has already taken responsibility

166
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:18,940
for his mistakes.

167
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,460
You can suspect me of anything,

168
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:23,740
but first, you need evidence.

169
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:28,500

170
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:30,540

00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:32,900

172
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:33,900
also lost his life,

173
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:36,020

00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:47,860
He knows how his brother died.

194
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:49,820
That's why he got people inside

195
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:51,180
to make you use.

196
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:53,180
He wants revenge on me.

197
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:55,140
He won't let us walk away.

198
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:57,980
So you have to go.

199
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:00,100
Let's go together.

200
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,580
You first, I'll be right behind.

201
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:03,340
Not without you.

202
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:04,060
Yat-wai.

203
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:08,180
Okay,

204
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:09,540
we'll go together.

205
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,380
At least on the surface.

206
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:12,220
Listen,

207
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:14,020
stay in university

208
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:14,860
and apply for retaking your courses.

209
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:16,540
I'll keep working

210
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:17,820
as the president of the court.

211
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:20,420
What about Grandma?

212
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:22,420
We'll bring her along.

213
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:23,380
Tell her

214
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:24,980
we're taking a trip.

215
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:28,020
The less she knows, the better.

216
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:29,580
She can never find out

217
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:31,140
about Hon Gong.

218
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:33,820
Dad,

219
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:35,900
that scumbag deserved to die.

220
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:38,060
I've never regretted it.

221
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:45,500
[President. Chun Yue]
If I could go back in time,

222
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:48,380
I'd tell my younger self
still cramming in law school

223
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:50,300
that people guard the law,

224
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:51,980
not the other way around.

225
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:53,820
[Chun Yue, a judge]
Law binds us.

226
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:55,900
[of the Court of Second Instance]
Reason binds the law.

227
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:57,620
Fair procedure

228
00:09:58,020 --> 00:09:58,820
is the balance

229
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:00,220
or

230
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:02,220
the safety net that shields the public.

231
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:04,420
There will always be a moment

232
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:05,820
when despair hits,

233
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:08,580
every legal door slams shut

234
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:10,980
and you have no idea what to do next.

235
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:12,300
At this moment,

236
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:13,820
you need to ask yourself.

237
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:15,020
What kind of person are you?

238
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:16,540
That way, you'll know

239
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:18,220
how you should judge.

240
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:21,980
You are

241
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:23,700
indeed not a human.

242
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:24,780
You're above us.

243
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:25,780
You know

244
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:27,220
what kind of weight he carries?

245
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:29,700
Without solid evidence,

246
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:31,340
don't go calling him in.

247
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:35,220
Mr. Wu, Madam,

248
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:37,220
we have a lead
on one of Hon Lit's subordinates.

249
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:38,300
I'll go over there.

250
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:39,420
Tong Huen,

251
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:42,740
why don't you focus on one case

252
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:44,300
and let someone else handle the other?

253
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:45,980
It looks like two cases,

254
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,220
but it's actually one.

255
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,180
The deaths of Ma San-po and Hon Gong

256
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:51,180
must be related to Chun Yue and Hon Lit.

257
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:52,260
So these two cases

258
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:53,180
cannot be separated.

259
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:54,300
They must be investigated together.

260
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:55,340
Okay.

You're on duty?

265
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:03,180
What's the situation?

266
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:04,900
His wound was soaked in water

267
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:06,020
and severely infected.

268
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:06,900
However,

269
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,020
he's lucky to be alive.

270
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:10,020
As long as he's not dead, it's fine.

271
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:30,700
What exactly do you want?

272
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:33,860
We don't want anything.

273
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:35,820
We won't arrest you.

274
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:37,220
We will even let you go.

275
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:40,020
As for when your boss will find you

276

What if I turn state's evidence?

279
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:54,420
Then I'll have to see

280
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:56,140
if it's worth it.

281

[Urban Figures]
Looks like he's riding high.

282
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:09,900
He clocks in every morning

283
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:11,540
and clocks out right after.

284

it's time to make a move.

287

Hon Lit, right?

293
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:47,860
I saw him kill Ma San-po.

294
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,500
Why did he do that?

295
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,660
I heard he received an anonymous tip

296
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:59,220
that Ma San-po was the one
who ran Mr. Hon Gong down.

297
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,180
Could Chun Yue

298
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:05,140
have called in that tip

299
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:07,380
just to shield his son

300
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,660
and shift the heat?

301
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:11,420
I only have one question
I can't figure out.

302
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:13,100
Why would Chun Yue

303
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:14,380
kill Hon Gong?

304
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:16,380
Perhaps Hon Lit would know.

305
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:24,860
Get out of the way. What are you doing?

306
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:26,140
Back off, police business.

307
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:32,100
We have evidence showing

Hon Lit is involved
in Ma San-po's death.

309
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:36,300
We need to bring him back
to assist in the investigation.

310

Mr. Hon Lit is not here.

311
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:38,340
He went out.

312

What a coincidence.

313
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:40,620
Doesn't matter.

314
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:42,660
We'll get a search warrant
and come back.

315
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:43,900
No need for all that.

316
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:45,060
If you want to search,

317
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:46,620
be my guest.

318
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:56,420

we found the nurse who resigned.

322
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:27,140
The hospital is very close to your home.

323
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,500
So every day at noon,

324
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,820
you go home for lunch.

325
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:31,380
Every time you go home,

326
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:33,420
you pass through the small path
behind the chapel.

327
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:35,780
That path is quite secluded,

328
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:36,740
with very few people.

329
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,380

330
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:40,420
if anyone else was there,

331
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,100
you'd remember, right?

332
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:45,140
I can't be sure.

333
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,220
After all, it was more
than half a year ago.

334
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:49,780
Could I trouble you

335
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:51,020

336
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:53,580
What is it about?

337
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:57,020
It's about the shooting case
in the chapel.

338
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:01,620
It won't take up too much of your time.

339
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:04,260
Mr. Chun,

00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:11,540
I'm very tired.

344
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:12,620

Now, try to recall.

370
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:19,700
When you went home for lunch
on that day,

371
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:22,660
did you pass through the small path
behind the chapel?

372
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:26,620
And while you were on it,

373
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:28,820
did you see anyone

374
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:30,980
step out of the chapel's back door?

375
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:33,860
I remember now.

376
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:35,420
I did see a man.

377
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:59,100
Is it this man in front of you?

378
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:19,540
Well?

00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:26,740
It's not him.

00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:28,180
I'm sure.

381
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:49,740
Why didn't you conduct a lineup?

382
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:52,180
Seeing you question me like this,

383
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:54,340
the witness might develop
subjective bias.

384
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:56,660
Dishonest evidence collection

385
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,460
may not even be admissible in court.

386
00:17:58,620 --> 00:17:59,940
You like a lineup?

387
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:01,140
I'll arrange another one.

388
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:03,220
Okay.

389
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:05,820
But first, you have to arrest me.

390
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:08,780
You don't have enough evidence.

391
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:10,300
What you're doing now

392
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:11,340
is harassing me.

393
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:14,020
I'm filing an official complaint.

394
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:15,660
Be my guest.

395
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:16,980
I won't stand in your way.

396
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:18,060
Meanwhile,

397
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:19,900
I'll keep investigating.

398
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:21,740
And you won't be able to stop me.

399
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:27,380
Flights and hotels are all booked.

400
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:29,060
We can depart this weekend.

401
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:31,180
Can we

402
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:32,380
book a cruise?

403
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:34,060
One that leaves before the weekend.

404
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:35,140
Why?

405
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:37,780
Cruises are way more comfortable

406
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:39,100
and everyone gets to unwind.

407
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:44,020
You think I don't know
just because you're silent?

408
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:45,940
I may be retired,

409
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:47,580
but my network's still intact.

410
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:49,380
Officially,

411
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:51,380
you're assisting in an investigation.

412
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:52,780
But truthfully?

413
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:54,180
You're being interrogated.

414
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:58,020
Are you related to the Hon Gong case

415
00:18:58,020 --> 00:18:59,060
at all?

416
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:01,580
You didn't really kill someone, did you?

417
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,860
Do you remember what you promised me?

418
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:06,460
You said you wouldn't ask
about certain things.

419
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:09,780
I'm just a little worried about you.

420
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:12,180
Their target is Hon Lit.

421
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:15,540
I have a deal with him.

422
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:17,340
As long as he doesn't harass Yat-wai

423
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:19,180
in prison,

424
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:21,140
I will approve his dad, Hon Fui-lung,

425
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:21,980
for medical parole.

426
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:26,220
No wonder.

427
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,060
You put him behind bars,

428
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:30,260
and now you're setting him free.

429
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:31,780
I had no choice.

430
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:34,180
It's quid pro quo.

431
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,540
We really should get going.

432
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:42,100
Too much has happened here.

433
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:43,660
Too many painful memories.

434
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:45,620
The three of us need a fresh start,

435
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:46,740
somewhere far from here.

436
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:49,060
Also,

437
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:51,220
we must not let anyone know

438
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:52,380
we're planning to leave.

439
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:54,180
I'll continue to go to court.

440
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:56,340
Yat-wai will continue to go to school

441
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:57,940
for admission applications.

442
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:00,380
In short, no one can find out.

443
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:04,260
We must leave as soon as possible.

444
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,060
The sooner, the better.

445
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:07,580
I'll get ready.

446
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:09,660
Also,

447
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:12,500
if you and Yat-wai

448
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:13,900
board the ship

449
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:15,540
and I'm not there,

450
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:16,420
don't panic.

451
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:18,180
Just go ahead.

452
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:20,460
I'll catch up,

453
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:20,980
okay?

454
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:23,540
Why would you say that?

455
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:24,860
I'm a little scared.

456
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:28,740
I mean, if.

457
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:53,060
Let's grab a drink and cool off a bit.

458
00:20:58,740 --> 00:20:59,700
What's up, Mr. Wu?

459
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:01,380
Did you receive a complaint?

460
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:03,580
You all know?

461
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,980
That's how investigating cases works,
Mr. Wu.

462
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:08,300
If we suspect someone,
we bring them in for questioning.

463
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:10,780
Is he the only one who's off-limits?

464
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:11,900
No.

465
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:13,580
His complaint

466
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:15,180
was not submitted directly to the CP,

467
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:16,980
but to the CSP.

468
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:19,180
Now, our current CSP

469
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:20,900
was only promoted

470
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:21,820
after Tat Ga-ma left.

471
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:22,740
So,

472
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:24,940
this complaint came back to me.

473
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:26,820
What does that mean?

474
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:28,540
Chun Yue

475
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:29,500
doesn't want to make a big deal
out of it.

476
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:30,740
Why?

477
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:32,220
Use your brain.

478
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:34,180
He has a guilty conscience.

479
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:38,100
So he's deliberately warning us

480
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,780
not to investigate him further.

481
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,220
Enough talking.

482
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:43,260
Let's have a proper meal first.

483
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:45,700
You can't solve cases
on an empty stomach.

484
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:47,220
Got it?

485
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:48,380
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

486
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:52,340
Off to work?

487
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:53,980
Yes, pulling the night shift.

488
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:55,980
Oh, right.

489
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:58,100
Do you know a nurse

490
00:21:58,100 --> 00:21:59,500
named Ting Sin?

491
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:00,820
She was working
at Eastern District Hospital

492
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,340
about six months ago.

493
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:04,820
Around that time,

494
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:06,500
I'd just been transferred back there.

495
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:09,100
Ting Sin?

496
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:10,900
Doesn't ring a bell.

497
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:13,060
Then can you help me find out

498
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:13,900
why she suddenly resigned

499
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:15,260
at that time?

500
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:16,900
Again?

501
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:19,420
Fine.

502
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:21,860
Hey, the food's in the fridge.

503
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:22,540
Bye.

504
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:23,660
Bye.

505
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:28,780
[Custodial Ward]

506
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:57,540
You take lives.

507
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:58,860
I save them.

508
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:01,620
We've never walked the same path.

509
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:04,140
You're right.

510
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:08,220
I'll kill to keep witnesses quiet.

511
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:31,220
And next time,

512
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:35,100
I'll kill you too.

513
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:46,420
Yat-wai,

514
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:47,940
just use your regular backpack

515
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:48,900
and put two changes of clothes in it.

516
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:50,340
And make sure no one sees.

517
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:52,340
Dad,

518
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:54,900
I want to bring this.

519
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:56,860
Of course you should.

520
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:06,700
Take these hats.

521
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:08,060
We'll wear them

522
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:09,900
when we watch the game.

523
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:11,220
Okay.

524
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:33,260
Madam,

525
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:35,140
I'll go get the surveillance footage
from security.

526
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:36,140
Okay.

527
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:39,020
Well,

528
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:40,020
feeling alright now?

529
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:42,620
Good thing you showed up
just a bit late.

530
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:44,900
Otherwise, who knows
what might've gone down.

531
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:47,220
Come on.

532
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:48,300
Ask for some time off.

533
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:49,660
I'll take you home.

534
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:52,740
Huen,

535
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:55,140
I got the answer.

536
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:57,140
I know why Ting Sin

537
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:58,540
resigned.

538
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:07,380
With Luk out of the picture,

539
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:09,900
the police have no evidence
to charge you.

540
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:12,260
You're in the clear.

541
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:14,780
If that judge ends up dead,

542
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:16,620
and I'm overseas at the time,

543
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:19,220
wouldn't that make for a perfect alibi?

544
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:22,020
You don't need to do it yourself.

545
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:23,300
His life

546
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:24,780
is in my hands.

547
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:29,780
I have to take care of the grudge

548
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:32,900
against my brother and my dad myself.

549
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:36,020
Even though you didn't say it,

550
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:38,260
I know

551
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:40,020
you're very sad.

552
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:43,460
You think Mr. Hon Fui-lung died
because of you.

553
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:47,620
Isn't that so?

554
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:50,820
If I hadn't tried to send my dad away,

555
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:52,940
he wouldn't have died.

556
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:55,980
You did that

557
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:57,060
to save him.

558
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:58,780
But he will never know.

559
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:01,820
I'll never have a chance to explain.

560
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:04,340
Until his last breath,

561
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:05,500
he thought I was trying to hurt him

562
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:07,700
and take his position.

563
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:10,620
Who would believe I never thought of

564
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:11,620
being the gang boss?

565
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:12,620
I do.

566
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:29,420
I put the plum blossom ring

567
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:31,620
in the study drawer.

568

00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:08,820
I truly respect you.

761
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:11,740
That shot from Lo Keung
didn't finish you.

762
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:13,620
You're tougher than I thought.

763
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:14,740
How about this?

764
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:16,980
Let's change the rules of the game.

765
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:18,620
Three bullets.

766
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:31,740
No need to spin it.

767
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:35,700
I'm still going first.

768
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:40,180
No, Dad. Give it to me.

769
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:43,140
No.

770
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:44,060
Alright.

771
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:45,380
Give it to me.

772
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:46,220
Dad, please.

773
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:46,740
Give it to me.

774
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:47,620
Now, Dad!

775
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:48,940
Just give it to me!

776
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:50,740
Hand it over!

777
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:21,820
Dad,

778
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:24,100
see?

779
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:26,500
You used to say I didn't have it in me.

780
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:29,060
But this time, I'm cruel enough.

781
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:31,020
And I'm not dying alone.

782
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:35,300
They

783
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:38,300
died because of you.

784
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:42,620
I want you to remember that!

785
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:02,380
Dad.

786
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:03,700
Dad.

787
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:05,180
Dad.

788
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:07,220
Dad.

789
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:08,420
Dad.

790
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:22,420
Dad, there's a bomb.

791
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:25,380
There are people in there.

792
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:32,940
Dad, they've taken hostages!

793
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:39,660
There's a bomb.

794
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:41,060
Run.

795
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:42,500
- Quick!
- Let's go!

796
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:06,740
Ma'am,

797
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:07,820
wake up.

798
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:08,900
Ma'am,

799
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:09,540
can you hear me?

800
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:10,660
Wake up! Are you okay?

801
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:11,300
Can you move?

802
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:12,660
I'll carry you on my back.

803
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:13,660
Come on.

804
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:26,980
Dad,

805
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:27,940
it's clear.

806
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:28,740
Let's go.

807
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:31,060
Hurry, Dad.

808
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:41,820
Help.

809
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:45,460
Mom!

810
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:03,340
Save me!

811
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:05,420
Mom!

812
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:15,980
Mom!

813
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:26,820
Mom, save me!

814
00:43:38,780 --> 00:43:40,380
My granddaughter!

815
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:42,140
She's still inside!

816
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:42,900
Dad.

817
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:43,740
Dad.

818
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:44,780
- Yat-wai!
- Dad!

819
00:43:44,780 --> 00:43:45,860
It's dangerous!

820
00:43:46,180 --> 00:43:47,500
My granddaughter!

821
00:43:47,540 --> 00:43:48,300
Dad!

822
00:43:53,060 --> 00:43:53,500
Yat-wai!

823
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:54,100
Dad!

824
00:43:57,140 --> 00:43:57,980
Is anyone there?

825
00:43:58,740 --> 00:43:59,980
Anyone?

826
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:01,580
Dad!

827
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:04,740
Is anyone there?

828
00:44:06,820 --> 00:44:07,700
Mr. Chun!

829
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:11,620
Dad!

830
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:17,100
Dad.

831
00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:18,180
Mr. Chun.

832
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:26,780
Dad!

833
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:28,620
Dad!

834
00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:32,300
Dad!

835
00:44:32,780 --> 00:44:33,340
Dad!

836
00:44:33,980 --> 00:44:35,020
Dad!

837
00:44:35,060 --> 00:44:36,580
Don't die!

838
00:44:36,580 --> 00:44:37,540
Dad!

839
00:44:38,540 --> 00:44:39,580
Dad!

840
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:43,540
Dad!

841
00:44:45,740 --> 00:44:47,140
Dad!

842
00:44:49,460 --> 00:44:50,660
Don't leave me!

843
00:44:57,020 --> 00:44:58,780
Please, stay with me!

844
00:45:44,660 --> 00:45:45,180
Today,

845
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:47,300
with heavy hearts,

846
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:48,780
we gather here to mourn a defender

847
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:49,860
of the law,

848
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:51,420
Mr. Chun Yue.

849
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:53,580
He believed that the law

850
00:45:53,780 --> 00:45:56,220
was society's final shield for justice.

851
00:45:57,300 --> 00:45:58,620
Mr. Chun dedicated his life

852
00:45:58,860 --> 00:46:00,620
to the law and justice.

853
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:03,860
Behind every judgment he made in court

854
00:46:04,180 --> 00:46:06,580
was respect for the rule of law
and humanity.

855
00:46:07,780 --> 00:46:09,860
Mr. Chun feared no power

856
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:11,100
and was unafraid of evil forces.

857
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:14,020
Even when faced with danger,
he never backed down.

858
00:46:15,020 --> 00:46:16,100
He demonstrated
responsibility and courage

859
00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:18,180
through his actions,

860
00:46:18,660 --> 00:46:21,300
inspiring hope for justice
in people's hearts.

861
00:46:22,580 --> 00:46:24,100
People always like to see

862
00:46:25,140 --> 00:46:26,700
what they want to see.

863
00:46:27,380 --> 00:46:28,860
Do you think he wasn't worthy?

864
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:37,580
He was a good father,

865
00:46:40,620 --> 00:46:42,220
a person who sacrificed himself
to save others.

866
00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:45,220
He integrated his life

867
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:47,300
into his belief in the law

868
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:49,300
and his pursuit of justice.

869
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:50,940
Ultimately,

870
00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:52,940
he sacrificed himself

871
00:46:53,820 --> 00:46:54,700
to save innocent lives.

872
00:47:04,220 --> 00:47:05,660
Mom!

873
00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:13,300
Mom!

874
00:47:15,980 --> 00:47:17,100
Save me!

875
00:47:37,740 --> 00:47:39,740
With his life, Mr. Chun

876
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:41,140
showed us one last time

877
00:47:41,140 --> 00:47:42,540
the true meaning of selfless service.

878
00:47:43,740 --> 00:47:44,660
His passing

879
00:47:45,220 --> 00:47:47,740
is a great loss
to the legal community and society.

880
00:47:48,820 --> 00:47:49,620
Mr. Chun,

881
00:47:49,940 --> 00:47:51,500
we will always remember you.

882
00:47:52,340 --> 00:47:53,940
Not just for your achievements,

883
00:47:54,340 --> 00:47:55,740
but also for your character.

884
00:47:56,460 --> 00:47:57,900
Although you have left us,

885
00:47:58,300 --> 00:47:59,260
your spirit

886
00:47:59,780 --> 00:48:00,860
will live on forever.

887
00:48:01,660 --> 00:48:03,940
You still see him as a villain?

888
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:05,700
A criminal?

889
00:48:15,340 --> 00:48:16,340
I am not a judge.

890
00:48:18,180 --> 00:48:19,260
I am just a police officer.

891
00:48:55,060 --> 00:48:55,900
Don't worry.

892
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:58,140
I will take good care of Yat-wai.

893
00:49:12,660 --> 00:49:13,340
Master,

894
00:49:15,340 --> 00:49:16,300
thank you.

895
00:49:43,540 --> 00:49:44,460
Rest in peace.

896
00:50:04,140 --> 00:50:05,100
Man proposes,

897
00:50:07,820 --> 00:50:08,740
God disposes.

898
00:50:11,420 --> 00:50:12,260
Judgment

899
00:50:13,620 --> 00:50:15,580
is never in our hands.
