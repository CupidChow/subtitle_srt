and my buddy.

18
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:13,460
Isn't that worth

00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:14,620

Wait for me here.

and didn't know
how cruel the world could be.

24
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:33,500
That's why he was tricked.

I'll need to have a nice chat
with her someday.

Don't you dare.

44
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:29,540
You gave Po's mother 200,000

45
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,180
to make her son plead guilty,

46
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:33,660

to cost him his life.

But you won't go to the cops

48
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:37,740

You hate them.

But I don't care.

51
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,220

A parent's love for a child

is beyond question.

94

But that love

95
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:02,020

Afterwards,

100
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:10,900
she tried not only to destroy evidence,

101
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:12,740
but also to frame others

102
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:14,740
to evade justice.

103
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:16,980
Even if she cooperates
with the investigation

104

00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:06,860
I take special care

195
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:09,260
to protect kids.

196
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:12,620
It's cute.

197
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:13,900
Chun.

198
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:15,500
Chun?

199
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:16,460
Mom!

200
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:17,540
Mom!

201
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:18,500
Mom!

202
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,220
Chun!

203
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:21,580
Chun!

204
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:23,340
Give me back my child!

205
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:24,580
Stop!

206
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:25,660
Chun!

207
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:28,220
Don't go! Chun...

208
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:31,100
Do you have kids?

209
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:33,060
It's Madam questioning you.

210
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:34,540
You don't question her.

211
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:39,660
At 7 AM on the day of the incident,

212
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:41,260
where were you?

213
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:47,380
At home.

214
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:50,900
In bed with my girlfriend.

215
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:59,460
Do you want me to describe the details?

216
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:03,380
Do you want me
to detain you for 48 hours?

217
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:06,180
You know how many cases

218
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:07,620
you have on your back.

219
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:09,620
I could pick any of them

220
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:10,820
and arrest you with it.

221
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:15,780
You should know

222
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:17,340
who killed Po.

223
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:19,380
If I knew, I wouldn't
have called you here.

224
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:21,220
You caught Po

225
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:23,380
because he hit Hon Gong.

226
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:26,140
Do you think he'd let Po go?

227
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:27,060
So you mean

228
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:29,340
Ma San-po hit Hon Gong?

229
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:31,820
Don't play dumb!

230
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:33,940
You cops always pretend to be righteous.

231
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:35,700
But you do all sorts of vile deeds
behind the scenes.

232
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:37,060
You know who did it

233
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:38,340
better than I do.

234
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:40,140
What a wretch.

235
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:41,460
Mind your language.

236
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:42,540
Chi Cheung-wing.

237
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:47,900
What?

238
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:51,540
Are you going to arrest me?

239
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,140
If not,

240
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:55,900
I'm leaving.

241
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:11,660
Madam allows you to go.

242
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:13,340
Go.

243
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:14,740
Get up.

244
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:16,500
Move.

245
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:28,860
Mr. Hon,

246
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:31,260
a stepmother isn't enough for you,

247
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:33,020
so you came here
looking for another one, huh?

248
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:36,020
Did you ever think about
how your mother would feel?

249
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:38,380
I'm afraid she can't rest easy

250
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:39,580
in her coffin.

251
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:41,300
If you care so much,

252
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:42,820
why not go down

253
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:44,420
and keep your mother company?

254
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:49,980
Careful not to trip.

255
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:51,260
I'm not done

256
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:52,420
with you on this.

257
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:54,340
Hey.

258
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:55,180
Chi Cheung-wing,

259
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:56,300
don't cause trouble.

260
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:05,700
Hello?

261
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:06,500
Wai,

262
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:08,820
they took Chun away.

263
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:12,740
What?

264
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:14,460
It was Chi Cheung-wing.

265
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:16,220
I recognized his men's car.

266
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:18,140
Sa, don't panic.

267
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:20,260
Go home now. Lock the door
and look after our daughter.

268
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:21,700
Chun will be fine.

269
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:23,900
I will bring him back.

270
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:25,380
Wai...

271
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:27,180
Wait for me.

272
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:36,300
[Eastern District Police Station]

273
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:37,940
Chi Cheung-wing,

274
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:39,420
come at me if you've got guts.

275
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:40,420
Keep away from my family.

276
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:42,380
Wai, didn't I tell you

277
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:43,580
my patience is limited?

278
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:45,860
And I hate babying kids.

279
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,420
As I do more,

280
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:49,740
I'll just want to slap him.

281
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:51,260
I'll do anything for you.

282
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:52,380
Just let my son go.

283
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:53,940
See?

284
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:56,060
Why did you think we had
no business to discuss?

285
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:57,740
Here it is.

286
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:14,660
Madam will be here shortly.

287
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,300
Any paper?

288
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:31,220
Chun!

289
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:32,660
Chun.

290
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:34,220
Chun.

291
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:39,820
It's okay.

292
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:41,940
Mom's here.

293
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:43,500
It's okay. Don't cry.

294
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:49,380
It's over now.

295
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:54,660
It's over.

296
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:58,820
Don't cry.

297
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:02,260
It's over.

298
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:12,380
I haven't asked,

299
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:13,460
and you're writing your confession?

300
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:17,580
I saw Chi Cheung-wing leave.

301
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:19,060
What,

302
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:20,620
are the cells too full

303
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:21,820
to hold him?

304
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:23,940
Give me some useful leads,

305
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:25,980
and I'll free up a cell for him.

306
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:28,300
Didn't you move the suspect

307
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:29,980
who hit my brother to another cell?

308
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:31,540
The suspect's name is Ma San-po.

309
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:33,140
No,

310
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:34,980
more accurately,

311
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:37,700
the shooting victim.

312
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:39,500
For your brother Hon Gong,

313
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:41,700
you had every reason to kill him.

314
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:44,300
Madam,

315
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:46,620
if you had evidence,

316
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,900
you wouldn't just call me in
to question me.

317
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:51,100
You'd have deployed the SDU

318
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:52,580
to haul me in

319
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:53,940
in the middle of the night.

320
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:56,940
No need to wait till late.

321
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:59,100
If you're so keen to go to jail,

322
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:00,980
I can put you in anytime.

323
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:05,740
I warn you,

324
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:07,660
don't blow this up.

325
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:10,060
You're not your brother or your father.

326
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:12,580
Don't make a fool of yourself.

327
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:15,460
I want all the bloodshed to stop.

328
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:22,260
Are you sure

329
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:25,780
Ma San-po was the one
who hit my brother?

330
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:29,820
If it wasn't him,

331
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:32,380
why would someone want
to kill him for revenge?

332
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:40,940
If you cops are so capable,

333
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:42,860
why did you

334
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:43,940
let this man

335
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:46,260
break into my brother's ward last night?

336
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:53,700
Is this Chi's man?

337
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,500
No.

338
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:57,500
Are you sure?

339
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:00,740
You can smell

340
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:02,700
the old town gang members

341
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:03,860
from a mile off.

342
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:26,540
Madam.

343
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:29,620
You were looking for me?

344
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:31,460
Chun Yat-wai.

345
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:34,460
I was going to leave quietly.

346
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:36,420
There's no point in saying goodbye.

347
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:41,060
About your problem

348
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:43,340
and your family's problem,

349
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:45,820
I'm not able to solve them.

350
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:48,900
I don't want them to end up being on me.

351
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:52,100
Get help from experts.

352
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:57,380
I'm off.

353
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:00,260
No need for goodbyes.

354
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:37,220
Why didn't you turn on all the lights?

355
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:39,420
Be quiet.

356
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:42,820
Close your eyes.

357
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,340
Give me your hand, darling.

358
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:55,580
I'm here.

359
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:58,140
Come with me.

360
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:02,860
Okay, sit down.

361
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:05,260
Right. Don't open your eyes yet.

362
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:12,140
So pretty.

363
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:14,980
Wait a moment.

364
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:16,220
Just a second...

365
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:19,420
and you can open your eyes.

366
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:22,260
Happy birthday.

367
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:25,580
♪Happy birthday to you♪

368
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:28,540

372
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:40,100
and blow out the candle.

373
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:43,060
Thank you.

374
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:52,420
Hey, what is it?

375
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:02,900
Okay, watch him for me.

376
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:03,700
I'll be right there.

377
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:05,340
What is it?

378
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:07,780
You know

379
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:09,700
I've been investigating
the Fu-Ngam Shantytown arson.

380
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:11,220
I suspect the prisoner

381
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:12,500
who died in custody was a scapegoat.

382
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:14,060
There should be someone behind it.

383
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:15,940

00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:20,300
I'd rule

767
00:43:20,980 --> 00:43:21,660
there isn't sufficient evidence.

768
00:43:22,780 --> 00:43:24,180
Then why are you

769
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:25,980
telling me this?

770
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:28,940
The police could follow this lead,

771
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:30,620
check CCTV nearby,

772
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:32,300
and find the truth.

773
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:41,380
May I tell you

774
00:43:41,380 --> 00:43:41,940
what I think?

775
00:43:44,020 --> 00:43:45,220
Two weeks ago,

776
00:43:45,860 --> 00:43:47,460
you introduced a client to me.

777
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:48,980
But you didn't tell me

778
00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:50,580
my client stole your car.

779
00:43:51,260 --> 00:43:52,060
Later,

780
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:54,460
my client got involved
in Hon Gong's case.

781
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:57,060
And you knew this all along.

782
00:43:57,700 --> 00:43:58,740
But again,

783
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:00,420
you told me nothing.

784
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:01,580
Yes,

785
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:03,500
you told me eventually

786
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:05,140
and pointed me to a way

787
00:44:05,140 --> 00:44:07,060
to bail my client.

788
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:09,020
But how did that turn out?

789
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:11,060
You saw it.

790
00:44:12,540 --> 00:44:13,460
And today,

791
00:44:13,620 --> 00:44:15,460
you suddenly came telling me all this.

792
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:17,620
Do you want to twist

793
00:44:17,620 --> 00:44:18,740
this dead story

794
00:44:19,180 --> 00:44:20,460
into something else?

795
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:25,180
Or do you want

796
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:27,260
to instruct me again on what to do?

797
00:44:31,660 --> 00:44:32,060
Yes.

798
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:35,340
You guessed right.

799
00:44:37,460 --> 00:44:38,300
This case

800
00:44:39,340 --> 00:44:40,620
is tied to me.

801
00:44:45,620 --> 00:44:46,500
Thanks, Bun.

802
00:44:47,140 --> 00:44:48,220
You have half an hour.

803
00:44:48,860 --> 00:44:49,420
That's enough.

804
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:01,420
Wai,

805
00:45:02,580 --> 00:45:03,340
sorry.

806
00:45:04,140 --> 00:45:05,140
I'll repay you

807
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:07,580
in the next life.

808
00:45:12,020 --> 00:45:13,660
SP650 requesting backup.

809
00:45:14,300 --> 00:45:15,740
We were ambushed at Sum Sek Street.

810
00:45:24,580 --> 00:45:25,220
That's right.

811
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:27,780
This matter

812
00:45:27,980 --> 00:45:29,500
is closely tied to me.

813
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:32,060
Because

814
00:45:32,060 --> 00:45:33,180
the one who hit Hon Gong

815
00:45:34,060 --> 00:45:34,980
was my son,

816
00:45:35,140 --> 00:45:35,780
Chun Yat-wai.

817
00:45:40,420 --> 00:45:41,580
I never meant to drag you in.

818
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:44,180
I only wanted you to help Ma San-po.

819
00:45:45,220 --> 00:45:46,500
But what followed

820
00:45:47,980 --> 00:45:48,940
went completely out of control.

821
00:45:51,260 --> 00:45:52,420
Mr. Chun Yue,

822
00:45:54,700 --> 00:45:56,820
you were my professor in law school.

823
00:45:57,860 --> 00:45:59,780
You taught me what law is,

824
00:46:00,100 --> 00:46:01,060
what justice is,

825
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:04,300
and that the law

826
00:46:04,620 --> 00:46:05,860
must never bow to the unlawful.

827
00:46:09,580 --> 00:46:11,060
I've always respected you.

828
00:46:42,820 --> 00:46:44,300
Scum, you said half an hour.

829
00:46:55,860 --> 00:46:56,380
Freeze!

830
00:46:56,380 --> 00:46:56,820
Don't shoot!

831
00:46:57,220 --> 00:46:58,220
Hands up!

832
00:46:58,220 --> 00:46:58,860
Don't shoot!

833
00:46:58,860 --> 00:46:59,660
Don't move!

834
00:47:00,140 --> 00:47:00,620
Don't shoot.

835
00:47:01,180 --> 00:47:01,580
Don't move!

836
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:02,540
Don't shoot!

837
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:05,020
Don't shoot!

838
00:47:05,020 --> 00:47:05,700
Hands up!

839
00:47:05,860 --> 00:47:06,540
Don't move!

840
00:47:06,540 --> 00:47:06,980
Don't shoot.

841
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:28,780
I don't want to force you.

842
00:48:29,420 --> 00:48:30,900
You can choose not to help me

843
00:48:32,140 --> 00:48:34,220
or act as if this never happened.

844
00:48:34,860 --> 00:48:36,620
And if you think I'm the villain,

845
00:48:37,060 --> 00:48:38,260
you can report me.

846
00:48:40,420 --> 00:48:41,540
I won't help you,

847
00:48:43,060 --> 00:48:44,740
but I won't run away either.

848
00:48:47,940 --> 00:48:49,580
You want to know if I'll report you,

849
00:48:50,180 --> 00:48:50,780
right?

850
00:48:54,740 --> 00:48:55,700
You're the judge.

851
00:48:56,820 --> 00:48:58,020
Guilty or not guilty,

852
00:48:58,780 --> 00:48:59,700
you decide.

853
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:03,580
But I don't want to hear
your guidance anymore.

854
00:49:05,380 --> 00:49:06,700
I'll clear Ma San-po's name

855
00:49:07,620 --> 00:49:08,940
in my own way.

856
00:49:19,220 --> 00:49:19,740
Lok-man.

857
00:49:22,060 --> 00:49:22,740
I'm sorry.
