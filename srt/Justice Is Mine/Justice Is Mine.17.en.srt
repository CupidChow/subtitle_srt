00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:01,340
but it's probably nothing serious.

189
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:03,540
She told me to get you anything

190
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:04,100
you want to eat.

191
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:05,740
I've bought it.

192
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:07,020
Just go grab a meal.

193
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:08,180
I'll keep him company.

194
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:10,380
Dad,

195
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:11,420
this duck

196
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:12,300
is from the restaurant where you took me

197
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,780
and my brother to eat when we were kids.

198
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:15,500
It was called Fooklam.

199
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:16,340
Do you remember?

200
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,020
I was even afraid it would sell out,

201
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:20,260
so I ordered it two days in advance.

202
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:21,420
Come on,

203
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:22,380
dig in while it's still warm.

204
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:43,180
Today, we're

205
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:45,260
skipping the wine and brandy.

206
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:46,980
Let's grab some beer

207
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:48,260
and take it easy.

208
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,500
Dad,

209
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:18,380
actually,

210
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:20,060
with the Uncles holding down the fort,

211
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:22,940
we're untouchable in the drug game.

212
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:25,660
Casino commissions
bring in serious profit,

213
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:27,980
especially the loan-sharking side.

214
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:29,220
I've carved it out as its own operation.

215
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:31,740
The future development of the old town

216
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:33,420
is our opportunity to shift

217
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:35,460
the Hon family's business
from illegal to legal.

218
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:37,140
That place is set to become

219
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:38,580
the next tourism and gambling hotspot.

220
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:40,180
If we don't fight for it,

221
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:41,380
the old town will take it all.

222
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:54,580
Thank you, Dad.

223
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:02,020
Actually, Gong's matter

224
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:04,140
has always been on my mind.

225
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:05,780
I will

226
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:07,820
most certainly avenge him.

227
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:38,540
Are you Tong Huen?

228
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:41,140
Sektau...

229
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:44,740
We've always called him that
since we were kids.

230
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:46,660
I know you're his girlfriend.

231
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:48,660
He showed me your picture

232
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:49,620
and mentioned you before.

233
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:53,380
I'm Lum Chin.

234
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:54,740
I know.

235
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:56,500
He told me about you.

236
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:59,020
May I

237
00:11:59,020 --> 00:11:59,940
offer incense to Sektau?

238
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:07,940
[In Memory of Sek Chi-yeung]

239
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:14,740
I hope one day

240
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:16,940
I can send him back
to the police cemetery.

241
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,100
I don't believe
Sektau was a rotten police officer.

242
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:21,740
Yes,

243
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:23,500
he helped the police

244
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,420
relay messages to Lung.

245
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:25,860
But I know

246
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:27,700
he never took Lung's money.

247
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:29,260
He was framed.

248
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:31,220
While investigating the arson,

249
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:32,900
he uncovered some untouchable secrets.

250
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:34,940
He found out that the killer

251
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:36,060
was just a scapegoat.

252
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:40,180
Something is off

253
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:41,300
with the case.

254
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:44,140
Now that Chi-yeung is dead,

255
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:46,140
all leads are gone.

256
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:49,940
[Sek Chi-yeung. Tat Ga-ma. Lau Mao]
No wonder he kept looking for Lau Mao.

257
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:53,020
I told him

258
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:55,500
that Lau Mao told others
he had seen the real killer.

259
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:58,740
I always believed the murderer

260
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:00,020
had already been locked up

261
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:00,940
and was dead.

262
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:03,860
The killer is still at large.

263
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:06,820
[Tall Man. Wrong guy. Scapegoat]
Sektau died

264
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:08,100
trying to find the real killer.

265
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:09,900
Oh, right.

266
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:11,460
Is there anything I can do to help?

267
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:14,140
Not unless you happen to have seen

268
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:15,980
the actual killer from two decades ago.

269
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,780
What were the features of that killer?

270
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:20,340
All we know

271
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:22,500
is he was tall

272
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:23,660
and had a scar

273
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:25,660
like an earthworm on his right shoulder.

00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:42,620
Anyway,

277
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:44,500
thank you for coming

I am Hon Fui-lung's woman.

280
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:51,060
You and Sektau didn't look down on me,

281
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:52,700
so I should be thanking you.

282
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:06,500
Chun Yue is responsible
for Gong's death,

283
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:08,940
so I will make his son pay.

284
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:12,420
This is called karma.

285
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:14,740
They both deserve to die.

286
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:18,220
But not now.

287
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,340

Dad, you know what?

291
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:44,820
When you and Gong were here,

292
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:47,100
I stood by you

293
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,340
no matter what.

294
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:51,140
I believed in you.

295
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:53,460
But now it's different.

296
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:55,900
Gong is gone.

You're all I have left.

298
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:00,340
No matter what,

299
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:02,340
I won't let anything happen to you.

300
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:05,700
I know

301
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,140
I'm not as capable as Gong.

302
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:10,220
But I'll give it everything I've got.

303
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:11,980
I'll do whatever you ask.

00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:14,220
Just give me a little time.

305
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:16,340
Even if it's just a little while.

306
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,620
Please, just trust me.

Prove yourself to him,

311
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:00,340
and carry out my final wish.

312
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:04,140
Understood, Dad.

313
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:50,340
You, come over here!

00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:56,500
Still flinching?

Let's go in.

00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:02,180
Talk about bad luck.

317
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:04,060
His brother owed money

318
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:05,660
and then died.

319
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:07,140
Now he's stuck with the debt.

320
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:09,060
Out of nowhere, he's got a bill to pay.

Bad luck? He's got nothing
on his cousin, Ma San-po.

323

Ma San-po?

324
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:17,860
What do they want?

325
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:19,220
Debts must be paid, of course.

326
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:22,940
They told him to help deliver goods
to pay off the debt.

327
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:24,300
That brat

328
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:25,660
chickened out.

329
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:28,340
That's why he got the beating.

330
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:33,820

Hey.

335
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:44,940
Tell them to stop.

336
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:46,700
Seriously?

337
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:48,620
I'll deliver for them.

338
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:49,340
What?

339
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:53,420
Are you serious?

340
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:54,740
Yes.

341
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:56,060
Are you crazy?

342
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:03,380
It's like this.

343
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:04,820
That brat's dad

My client

346
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:12,020
is innocent.

347
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:14,980
The victim of the shooting
was an 18-year-old young man

348
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:17,220
from the old town, Ma San-po.

349
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:24,020
Done.

350
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:30,220
Take it back to the cell.

351
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:31,340
Wait till I come for you.

352
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:46,420
So, you're the judge's son, huh?

353
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:49,820
Look how weak he is.

354
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:54,820
A gust of wind would knock him over.

355
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:56,660
Get up.

356
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:57,980
So useless.

357
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:58,740
I could end you right here.

358
00:18:58,740 --> 00:18:59,420
What are you doing?

359
00:18:59,420 --> 00:18:59,980
Behave yourselves.

360
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:01,060
Watch yourself.

361
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:02,100
Forget it.

362
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:03,100
Go.

363
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:05,740
Are you okay?

364
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:06,980
I'm fine.

365
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:07,820
Stop.

366
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:17,740
Did he really do it?

367
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:20,140
Hearing that guy's Ma San-po's cousin,

368
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:22,180
he had no choice.

369
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:50,340
How did your arm get hurt?

370
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:52,740
It's nothing.

371
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:54,540
Stop.

372
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:01,060
You look terrified.

373
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:04,140
Is someone bullying you?

374
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:05,660
No.

375
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:07,340
If so, you must let us know.

376
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:09,980
The warden told us
to take good care of you.

377
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:12,820
Go.

378
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:17,900
I was being careless.

379
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:22,900
I know it's tough in here.

380
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:25,380
Even out here,

381
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:27,620
I keep telling myself

382
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:29,740
it'll end someday.

383
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:31,500
Yat-wai,

384
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:32,940
hang in there.

385
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:37,460
I brought you some books.

386
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:39,020
No need.

387
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:41,540
Grandma already brought me a lot.

388
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:44,140
That's right.

389
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:46,420
She and I both think

390
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:48,500
it's time you hit the books.

391
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:49,740
So when you get out,

392
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:51,620
you can slide
right into college classes.

393
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:52,700
Dad.

394
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,580
If Ma San-po were still alive...

395
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:59,380
would he have made it to university?

396
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:01,020
Why would you say that?

397
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:02,260
Sometimes

398
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,540
I think about his face.

399
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,060
Shouldn't we be looking ahead?

400
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:13,140
Here,

401
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:14,180
they all call me

402
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:15,260
the judge's son.

403
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:16,860
But the truth is,

404
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:18,780
I'm no different from them.

405
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:20,740
We're all just prisoners.

406
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:23,340
Dad,

407
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:25,420
I've grown up.

408
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:26,900
I can take care of myself.

409
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:13,460
A knife wound,

410
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,420
curled like an earthworm.

411
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:19,260
Clearly, the result of stitching.

412
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:20,780
You're asking

413
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:22,060
if anyone would remember

414
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:24,060
whether he really went to the hospital

415
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:25,580
for treatment?

416
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:26,340
Exactly.

417
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,540
Huen, stop fooling around.

418
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:31,660
That was 20 years ago.

419
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:34,780
I know I can't check

420
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:36,980
every hospital's files from back then.

421
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:38,420
But I can ask, can't I?

422
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:40,300
With your connections,

423
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:42,020
maybe I really can find out

424
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,180
if there was a doctor or nurse

425
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:45,980
who did that kind of surgery.

426
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:48,100
They might still remember the person.

427
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:51,740
Is this evidence important?

428
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:55,380
It might be

429
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:57,900
evidence to clear Sek's name.

430
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:03,620
Understood.

431
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:07,860
I'll help you.

432
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:15,020
Your blood pressure's a little high.

433
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:16,420
I'd recommend cutting back on alcohol.

434
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:17,900
Now that I'm out on medical parole,

435
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:19,700
I need a condition you can treat.

436
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:22,460
Lung, please get some proper rest.

437
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:26,580
Lung.

438
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:30,340
Weren't you feeling sick earlier?

439
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:32,740
Let me call the doctor back
to check on you.

440
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:34,300
I'm fine, Lung.

441
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:37,020
Yesterday was the anniversary
of my brother's death.

442
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:43,380
He was only six when he passed away.

443
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:48,700
Don't dwell

444
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:50,620
on the past.

445
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:53,180
But every time I see you,

446
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:55,660
I can't help but think about it.

447
00:23:58,540 --> 00:23:59,380
What do you mean?

448
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:03,500
Twenty years ago, the shantytown fire

449
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:06,220
killed my entire family.

450
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:09,540
But on that very night,

451
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:10,860
I met you.

452
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:13,340
I still remember.

453
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:14,020
I found you

454
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:15,940
squatting by the road,

455
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:17,980
totally bewildered

456
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:20,380
and weeping until your eyes were puffy.

457
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:24,060
Lung,

458
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:26,380
you're not from the shantytown.

459
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:27,940
Why were you there

460
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:29,180
that night?

461
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:32,780
It was to meet you.

462
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:40,780
Lung,

463
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:42,300
I found this leather jacket.

464
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:43,140
Do you remember it?

465
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:46,340
On the night we met,

466
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:47,780
you were wearing this exact one.

467
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:50,060
You still kept it?

468
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:51,820
It holds some memories, doesn't it?

469
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:55,700
Let's see if it still fits me.

470
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:12,980
It does.

471
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:14,220
Feels just right.

472
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:15,380
Lung.

473
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:18,540
You and Lit

474
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:20,500
are the only family I have left.

475
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:23,020
Is there something you want to tell me?

476
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:29,740
Yes.

477
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:33,860
I appreciate you

478
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,500
helping me look after my two sons

479
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:37,380
these past twenty years.

480
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:42,300
And...

481
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:44,860
what do you feel like eating?

482
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:46,620
I'll send someone to pick it up.

483
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:09,220
[Sek Chi-yeung]

484
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:19,420
[Fu-Ngam Shantytown arson.
Sek Chi-yeung]

485
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:44,300
Lo Keung,

486
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:46,940
you've been by my side
for 20 years, right?

487
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:48,340
Twenty-one years, actually.

488
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:56,660
We'll talk here.

489
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:58,340
Go wait over there.

490
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:09,060
I didn't expect

491
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:12,300
that now I can't even boss around

492
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:13,660
my two subordinates.

493
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:16,100
Mr. Hon Lit asked us

494
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:17,980
to protect you at all times.

495
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:19,780
So tell me. Whom do you answer?

496
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:21,660
Him, or me?

497
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:31,540
Don't be nervous.

498
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:35,820
Having you by his side

499
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:37,100
puts my mind at ease.

500
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:39,300
Sir,

501
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:41,300
no matter what,

502
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:43,540
I will always follow your orders.

503
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:47,460
I'm proud of what Lit's become.

504
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:50,940
Even if he

505
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:52,580
takes over the family,

506
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:54,260
I'm fine with that.

507
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:58,540
Our family must carry on and thrive.

508
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:03,100
But my son is gone.

509
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:05,380
Someone has to pay with their life.

510
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:09,860
That judge must die.

511
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:13,460
I know what to do.

512
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:16,580
No one else will ever know about this.

513
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:36,780
Mr. Wu,

514
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:39,940
can you respect personal boundaries?

515
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:42,980
If I didn't,

516
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:44,860
I would've aired your dirty laundry
a long time ago.

517
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:47,100
What did I do?

518
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:49,780
I've had two hospitals reach out,

519
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:52,180
reporting that you meddled
in their work.

520
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:54,660
I was only in their way

521
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:55,660
for a minute or two, tops.

522
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:57,820
As soon as they heard
it was a police inquiry,

523
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:00,060
it put pressure on them

524
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:01,180
and caused a disturbance.

525
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:06,260
Could you please pass along

526
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:08,580
my heartfelt apology

527
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:10,180
to them?

528
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:13,940
What you're doing

529
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:16,940
is really like looking for a needle
in a haystack, isn't it?

530
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:18,140
There's a difference.

531
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:20,020
Because if I'm the one looking,

532
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:21,220
the chances are a bit higher.

533
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:22,700
Okay, just make sure

534
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:24,260
you handle it
with the utmost discretion

535
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:26,500
and don't let Tat Ga-ma get suspicious.

536
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:31,460
Mr. Tat.

537
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:35,980
Freshly baked egg tarts.

538
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:37,100
Lung hasn't had them in a long time.

539
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:39,180
You even brought coffee.

540
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:40,860
Egg tarts with coffee.

541
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:41,500
A perfect match.

542
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:44,820
Not as perfect as you and Lung.

543
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:45,700
Lung,

544
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:48,380
Mr. Tat brought egg tarts and coffee.

545
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:49,180
Just set them down here.

546
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:52,740
Lung, take your time chatting.

547
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:53,420
I'll head out now.

548
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:54,500
Take care on your way.

549
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:58,340
Have a seat over here.

550
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:05,900
Despite her background,

551
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:08,020
you still kept her close.

552
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:09,100
Lung,

553
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:10,700
you sure have an eye for the unusual.

554
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:12,540
Knock it off.

555
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:13,340
What is it?

556
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:15,340
I'm just jealous of you.

557
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:16,980
Back then,

558
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:19,380
thanks to you torching the shantytown,

559
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:21,500
we took a great risk and made a fortune.

560
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:23,540
I never imagined

561
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:24,820
your biggest reward

562
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:25,980
would be falling for her.

563
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:27,980
Drop the nonsense.

564
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:29,860
Get to the point.

565
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:31,180
Here's the deal.

566
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:33,580
Burning down the shantytown

567
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:35,540
was our ticket
to making that first fortune,

568
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:36,820
which could get us

569
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:39,860
a piece of the old town's
future development.

570
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:42,540
Soon, we'll be reaping the rewards.

571
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:44,300
And then,

572
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:46,980
we'll retire in comfort.

573
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:47,940
Sounds pretty good, doesn't it?

574
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:50,580
Pretty good.

575
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:54,220
Then stop obsessing over the judge.

576
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:56,580
Besides,

577
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:57,900
you only got out

578
00:30:58,220 --> 00:30:59,740
because he signed off on it.

579
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:01,460
Should I thank him?

580
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:05,620
Your son is dead.

581
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:08,420
You can punish him all you want,

582
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:09,900
but it won't bring your son back.

583
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:12,500
I've said all I need to say.

584
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:14,140
I advise you not to be so stubborn.

585
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:15,660
One last thing,

586
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:17,900
they have powerful backing.

587
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:19,980
You'd better think this through.

588
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:26,900
I'm not afraid of them!

589
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:31,060
Huen.

590
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:32,580
A retired head nurse

591
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:33,500
stopped by for a visit.

592
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:34,780
We chatted for a bit.

593
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:37,380
I'm guessing
she must've seen that person.

594
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:39,260
Back then,

595
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:40,780
I was an emergency room nurse.

596
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:43,180
That man came in

597
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,700
with half his body soaked in blood.

598
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:49,060
The knife wound was so long and deep

599
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:51,300
that it required dozens of stitches.

600
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:53,420
I missed celebrating my birthday

601
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:56,260
with my family that day,
all because of him.

602
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:58,780
That's why the memory is so vivid.

603
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:00,860
When is your birthday?

609
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:37,860
Dad,

610
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:39,060
Ms. Lum

611
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:40,820
made this soup for you.

612
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:42,500
She had something urgent to deal with

613
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:43,780
and said she'd come by later.

614
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:45,580
She told me to make sure

615
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:47,300
you drink it while it's hot,

616
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:48,580
or else it'll lose its nutrients.

617
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:50,300
Come on, have it now.

618
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:21,460
Sir,

619
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:22,700
I'm making my move.

620
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:23,860
You'll hear from me soon.

621
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:41,100
Next time,

622
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:42,980
just send someone to drop it off.

623
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:53,940
You need to focus

624
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:55,180
on your job more.

625
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:58,220
Supporting the Hon family is difficult.

626
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:02,900
Despite all my effort

627
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:04,580
and everything I do,

628
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:06,980
you'll never value me

629
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:08,420
the way you valued Gong.

630
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:16,260
You never believed me.

631
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:19,700
You don't think I'll avenge Gong.

632
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:23,900
Even if it means sacrificing
the entire Hon family

633
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:25,380
and costing all of us everything,

634
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:27,500
you still demand revenge right now.

635
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:29,380
Why can't you just be patient?

636
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:56,820
Even Lo Keung betrayed me.

637
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:58,820
Keung's loyalty to you is exactly

638
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:00,660
why he doesn't want
to see you back in prison.

639
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:03,140
So, you've grown bold, huh?

640
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:05,460
As long as I'm still standing,

641
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:08,460
I'm the head of the Hon family.

642
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:10,380
You don't get to tell me what to do!

643
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:11,180
Dad.

644
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:12,740
Gong is gone.

645
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:16,180
But I'm still here.

646
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:18,700
Aren't I your son?

647
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:20,180
If you are, you must obey me.

648
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:22,460
Your brother never defied me.

649
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:23,620
Yet you

650
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:25,980
do things your own way.

651
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:30,140
I said I would get revenge.

652
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:32,580
But when to make the move

653
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:34,780
is my call.

654
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:36,420
It's up to me!

655
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:36,900
You...

656
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:49,820
You...

657
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:16,500
No matter what you think of me,

658
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:19,060
I can't just sit by and watch you

659
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:21,260
die in prison.

660
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:33,060
I've found the real culprit
behind the shantytown arson.

661
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:34,620
It's Hon Fui-lung.

662
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:36,620
With this new evidence,

663
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:37,940
we can reopen the case.

664
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:39,220
If we catch Hon Fui-lung,

665
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:40,140
we can prove

666
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:41,180
Tat Ga-ma was the one

667
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:42,060
who paid Lau Mao to stay quiet.

668
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:43,380
Once we prosecute Tat Ga-ma,

669
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:44,980
Sek Chi-yeung's name
can finally be cleared.

670
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:46,140
Calm down.

671
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:48,940
We can't rush this.

672
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:50,860
We need a careful plan,

673
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:53,300
and above all, no one can find out.

674
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:56,380
I told Lum Chin

675
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:57,580
about the scar on his body.

676
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:07,660
I've already arranged for people

677
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:09,140
to smuggle Dad

678
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:10,660
to a country with no extradition treaty.

679
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:12,780
Even if the police find out,

680
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:14,500
they won't be able to touch us.

681
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:15,780
This medicine

682
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:17,180
will just put him to sleep.

683
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:18,740
He'll be fine once he wakes up.

684
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:21,140
It won't be easy
having to look after him.

685
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:22,580
Once he's arrived

686
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:24,100
and settled,

687
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:25,900
I'll go and apologize to him.

688
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:29,020
Is this really necessary?

689
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:33,900
I'll go check if everything's ready.

690
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:35,860
Someone will come to take you shortly.

691
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:37,340
Start packing.

692
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:39,220
Ms. Lum,

693
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:40,780
the boat that will take you
and Mr. Hon

694
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:42,460
to the Philippines arrives in two hours.

695
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:44,220
Everything is arranged.

696
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:48,260
You go grab a meal.

697
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:50,220
When you get back,

698
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:51,740
please bring Lung
a bowl of seafood porridge,

699
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:54,100
so it's ready for him when he wakes up.

700
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:56,180
Don't be long.

701
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:58,620
We'll be back as soon as possible.

702
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:22,500
What you did

703
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:24,340
was also for my dad.

704
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:28,180
Don't worry
about bearing a little injustice

705
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:30,620
or being misunderstood.

706
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:32,380
What matters most

707
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:34,180
is saving Dad's life.

708
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:51,500
Only by leaving this place

709
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:53,420
can he be truly free.

710
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:56,140
Actually, he

711
00:39:56,780 --> 00:39:58,260
clearly favored Mr. Hon Gong over you.

712
00:39:58,980 --> 00:39:59,740
But he's not impossible

713
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:01,580
to deal with.

714
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:08,420
I told you to go with my dad.

715
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:09,940
Why did you stay?

716
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:13,980
I stayed for the Hon family.

717
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:18,980
He'll be happy to hear that,

718
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:21,300
because he didn't lose.

719
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:34,940
Mr. Hon Lit,

720
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:36,020
someone's here for Ms. Lum.

721
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:37,140
Who is it?

722
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:38,700
A policewoman surnamed Tong.

723
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:54,620
Madam,

724
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:56,740
what brings you here
in the middle of the night?

725
00:40:57,300 --> 00:40:58,660
You're not the one I want to meet.

726
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:00,140
You're here for Lum Chin?

727
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:01,140
Is this business or personal?

728
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:03,700
I don't owe you an explanation.

729
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:06,740
I won't stop you from finding her.

730
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:09,180
But this is my home,

731
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:11,060
and you're not welcome here.

732
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:41,980
In case of an emergency,

733
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:43,580
just wake him up.

734
00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:08,980
What happened?

735
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:12,900
I know it was you

736
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:15,180
who set fire to the shantytown back then.

737
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:22,300
Back then, thanks to you
torching the shantytown,

738
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:24,700
we took a great risk and made a fortune.
