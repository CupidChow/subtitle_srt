00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:35,300
Chi,

192
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:37,140
the hospital said Gau is dead.

193
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:38,300
There's nothing they can do.

194
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:44,180
I knew
something was wrong with that call.

195
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:46,460
He wasn't the one who delivered.

196
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:49,020
It was not an accident.

197
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,660
Scumbag. Cho Wai-yi

198
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:53,300
wanted to blow me up as well.

199
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:55,900
We searched everywhere.

200
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:57,060
No one is here.

201
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:58,060
They must take off.

202
00:11:58,580 --> 00:11:59,020
Chi,

203
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:00,340
the news said

204
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:02,260
the one who robbed the truck
got away with an injury.

205
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:03,380
He couldn't be far away.

206
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:09,100
The police are also looking for him.

207
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:12,420
He is injured,
but he won't dare to go to the hospital.

208
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:16,220
Get the word out.

209
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:17,500
If any doctor from the black market

210
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,100
helps Cho Wai-yi,

211
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:20,660
they will die with him.

212
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:21,700
Got it, Chi.

213
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:37,580
Here. Press the wound.

214
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:38,700
I'm going to stitch it.

215
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:41,220
Hurry.

216
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:42,940
Do you want him to bleed to death?

217
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:48,220
Let go now.

218
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:07,620
For the interview,
show them you are reliable.

219
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,580
Take the red one.

220
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:11,140
When you get to be the chief justice,

221
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:12,780
you can wear the gray one.

222
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:14,500
Do you like it?

223
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:18,540
Shall I choose one more for you?

224
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:36,460
He is getting better.

225
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,940
He will be fine after a few days' rest.

226
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:41,420
Thank you, Mr. Pang.

227
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:43,620
Wai, did you hear it?

228
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:45,260
You will be fine.

229
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:47,580
We will be fine.

230
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:51,900
Mr. Pang.

231
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:53,380
It's for you.

232
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,580
Am I that kind of person?

233
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:01,820
Thank you, Mr. Pang.

234
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,540
He lost a lot of blood.

235
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:05,460
You should get
some blood-nourishing food

236
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:06,260
for him to recover.

237
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:08,540
Well,

238
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:10,180
Mr. Pang, could you please

239
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:11,300
stay and take care

240
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:12,340
of him for a bit?

241
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:13,980
I will buy him something

242
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:15,860
and check my kids on the way.

243
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:17,380
Please.

244
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:19,340
I can only stay for a while.

245
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:21,580
There will be patients
waiting for me in the afternoon.

246
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:22,980
Sure. I will be quick.

247
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:23,780
I will be quick.

248
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:24,260
As quick as possible.

249
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:25,740
Alright. Thank you, Mr. Pang.

250
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:49,540
Mr. Chun,

251
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,420
I didn't see you just now.

252
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:53,980
I was so worried
that something happened to you.

253
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:55,300
Thank you for that.

254
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:57,460
My interview went very well.

255
00:14:58,220 --> 00:14:59,660
For some reason, I have

256
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:01,660
a very, very good feeling.

257
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,580
I thought you figured it out

258
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:07,500
and decided to mind your own business

259
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:09,060
and stop asking for trouble.

260
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:10,540
Thank you for your concern.

261
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:12,580
Good luck then.

262
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:18,980
Since the first day I became a judge,

263
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:20,260
I've been asking myself

264
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:21,740
if conviction

265
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:23,780
is the only way to uphold law and order.

266
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:25,620
Research shows

267
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:28,060
that judges from the prosecutor's office

268
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:29,660
have a higher conviction rate.

269
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:32,300
This conviction tendency

270
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:33,500
is likely due to

271
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:36,060
their long experience
of prosecution work.

272
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:37,820
Sometimes,

273
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:39,420
they don't even notice it themselves.

274
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:40,700
However, I worked

275
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:42,060
in the prosecutor's office

276
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:43,660
for only half a year.

277
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:46,620
Mr. Chun, are you saying

278
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:49,300
that you can be

279
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:51,700
more objective and fairer in the trial

280
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:53,700
if you are the chief justice?

281
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:56,460
Is that your advantage?

282
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:58,580
I believe the goal of the chief justice

283
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:00,100
shouldn't be the conviction rate,

284
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:02,420
but the justice of the legal system.

285
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:05,300
How about the case

286
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:06,860
of Ting Hoi-yee a year ago?

287
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:08,300
Do you still remember that?

288
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:39,020
I do.

289
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:41,180
It was a case of manslaughter.

290
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:42,980
You had only been to the court twice,

291
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:45,860
and you suddenly asked
to take yourself off.

292
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:47,300
Because of that,

293
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:48,740
the case had to be revisited.

294
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:50,220
It wasted both taxpayers' money

295
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:51,180
and time.

296
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:52,780
Could you please explain

297
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,460
why you did that?

298
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:57,740
Because the defendant

299
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:00,620
looked very similar to my wife,

300
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:03,140
including the way she talked and acted.

301
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:05,300
I was worried

302
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:06,700
that I couldn't

303
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:08,540
make a decision without bias.

304
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:10,540
It was less than a month

305
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:13,980
since my wife passed away.

306
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,580
I know it was not a perfect solution,

307
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:19,500
but...

308
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:20,380
Don't you believe

309
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:22,180
it was perfect?

310
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:25,380
Ma San-po.

311
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:27,340
Cho Wai-yi.

312
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:31,060
You did so many
inappropriate and unfair things.

313
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:32,220
Do you

314
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:34,300
ever feel guilty

315
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,220
about that?

316
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:38,980
Can you even sleep well

317
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:40,340
at night?

318
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:43,860
You...

319
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:45,140
What do you mean?

320
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:47,260
I mean

321
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:50,140
I agree with you.

322
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:53,420
Nothing is perfect in the world.

323
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:55,660
We are human beings, not machines.

324
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:57,580
I believe

325
00:17:58,180 --> 00:17:59,780
if I were you at that time,

326
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:02,460
I would do the same thing.

327
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:22,540
Could you please explain

328
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:24,060
why you did that?

329
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,260
Because the defendant

330
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:27,980
looked very similar to my wife...

331
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:31,740
Let me ask you.

332
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:33,660
What's the sound of a whale?

333
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:53,100
The phone you are dialing
is not available...

334
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:05,180
Because of you,

335
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:06,300
I lost two men

336
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:07,500
who had been with me
for over a decade.

337
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:09,420
What you really wanted

338
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:11,180
was my life,

339
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:12,060
right?

340
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:51,500
Yat-wai.

341
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:53,780
Yat-wai.

342
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:55,380
Open the door. It's Grandma.

343
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:58,300
Yat-wai,

344
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:01,700
I want to talk to you.

345
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:08,540
You don't have to go to school, right?

346
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:25,020
Yat-wai,

347
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:26,500
I know.

348
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:29,140
I was too intense before.

349
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:31,740
All I want is that nothing bad

350
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:33,500
will happen to our family ever again.

351
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:38,420
Your father and I fight a lot.

352
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:40,180
It also causes you trouble.

353
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:41,420
I promise.

354
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:43,460
I will keep this in mind from now on.

355
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:48,780
Yat-wai,

356
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:52,340
say something, please.

357
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:54,340
I have nothing to say.

358
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:05,700
Do you recognize this necklace?

359
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:08,580
Yes.

360
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:11,100
Three years ago, I gave it

361
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:13,020
to your mother as a gift.

362
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:16,540
The circle

363
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:17,860
is a symbol for completeness.

364
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:19,740
After your mother passed away,

365
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:22,140
your father couldn't find it.

366
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:24,740
It turns out that you gave it to Ms. Yu,

367
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:26,980
and later, she gave it back to me.

368
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:30,140
Where did you find the necklace?

369
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:32,220
Why didn't you tell your father?

370
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:42,700
Yat-wai.

371
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:20,260
Hey.

372
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:20,660
Mr. Hon Lit.

373
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:21,820
What's wrong?

374
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:23,020
Mr. Hon Gong

375
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:24,220
became like this for no reason.

376
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:29,980
What's wrong?

377
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:31,620
He was doing fine before.

378
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:33,460
He is having a seizure.

379
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:35,300
It might be a consequence

380
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:36,140
of the heavy hit to the head.

381
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:37,820
We are

382
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:38,940
giving him sedative

383
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:40,100
to calm him down.

384
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:42,140
Then we will have a further check.

385
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:48,900
Let's have a chat.

386
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:52,740
If it's about your brother,

387
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:54,220
as the doctor said,

388
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:55,420
the recovery

389
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:57,180
from a brain injury takes a long time.

390
00:23:58,260 --> 00:23:59,020
It's not about my brother,

391
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:00,500
but your sister.

392
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:03,100
My sister?

393
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:06,380
What's the matter with my sister?

394
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:10,220
The police station said
she is on holiday,

395
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:12,220
and she is not answering my call.

396
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:16,460
She was forced
to take some days off because of you.

397
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:18,620
My sister is a police.

398
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:20,580
She can't have anything to do with you.

399
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:23,340
I never want to have anything
to do with her.

400
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:31,620
I'm sorry that your sister

401
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:33,260
had to take some days off

402
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:34,540
because of me,

403
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:37,580
but I need to ask her something.

404
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:40,300
My sister

405
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:41,700
has nothing to tell you.

406
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:42,980
That is up to me,

407
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:44,340
not her.

408
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:46,660
What do you mean?

409
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:49,220
C&IIB wants to talk to me.

410
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:50,340
It's probably

411
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:51,780
about your sister.

412
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:55,220
There is nothing
between my sister and you.

413
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:57,820
It depends

414
00:24:58,140 --> 00:24:59,020
on what I say.

415
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:03,620
What do you want?

416
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:06,460
Tell your sister.

417
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:08,020
My brother woke up,

418
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:09,860
and he saw the guy.

419
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:16,660
Tong Huen is forced
to take a leave of absence.

420
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:18,700
Is this what you want?

421
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:21,860
Isn't this what you want, too?

422
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:23,500
She concealed the evidence,

423
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:25,580
and it wasn't fair.

424
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:28,220
You are always speaking about justice

425
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:29,980
with such self-righteousness.

426
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:32,980
If there is nothing else

427
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:34,620
you want to say...

428
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:36,220
You use people who trust you,

429
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:38,420
dragging the innocent into it.

430
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:40,660
Don't you feel guilty at all?

431
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:46,900
Wai.

432
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:49,620
Wai.

433
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:04,660
Wai.

434
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:11,980
Wai!

435
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:19,100
I never thought
it would end up like this.

436
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:23,500
I don't want to go through the past,

437
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:26,700
but from day one

438
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:28,140
when I asked you to help Ma San-po,

439
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:31,740
I truly wanted you to help him.

440
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:35,900
But now he is sacrificed.

441
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:37,740
It's my fault.

442
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:41,580
It's not your fault.

443
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:44,660
Your only mistake

444
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:47,260
is that you mistrusted me.

445
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:52,980
Let it go,

446
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:56,060
and have a fresh start.

447
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:34,020
Hey, you are done?

448
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:41,740
It's Hon Lit.

449
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:47,420
Cut to the chase.

450
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:49,100
My brother woke up.

451
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:51,740
The one I sketched
might be who you are looking for.

452
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:53,020
You'd better hurry up.

453
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:00,260
I look forward to your good news.

454
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:07,060
Thank you.

455
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:15,700
My sister

456
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:16,780
is a good police.

457
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:31,540
Keep your distance from Hon Lit.

458
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:33,580
Stay away from this.

459
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:37,820
The watch he sent was for me.

460
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:39,780
He didn't mean to frame you.

461
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:42,020
I know.

462
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:44,100
It's someone else.

463
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:46,860
Then...

464
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:48,300
Just keep your distance from him.

465
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:49,380
Did you hear me?

466
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:54,860
Well,

467
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:57,460
whether you like it

468
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:58,300
or not,

469
00:28:58,700 --> 00:28:59,820
you are

470
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:00,820
on holiday now.

471
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:02,540
Perhaps

472
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:03,500
I can take a few days off,

473
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:04,660
and we can travel together.

474
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:08,780
I have things to do.

475
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:13,260
I will send you home first,

476
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:14,940
and then I need to see Mr. Sek.

477
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:18,940
So that's what you are busy with.

478
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:20,300
You put that man over your sister.

479
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:29,220
[Chi Cheung-wing. Ma San-po. Revenge]

480
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:41,020
Ms. Tong,

481
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:43,740
this is not taking a leave.

482
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:45,580
You are literally trying

483
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:46,900
to move your office to my place.

484
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:48,900
I finally sorted out

485
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:50,460
everything in the entire case.

486
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:51,900
I really want you to be objective

487
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:52,940
and hear me out one more time.

488
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:54,660
See if I'm right.

489
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:55,740
Ms. Tong,

490
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:57,180
I just got off from work.

491
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:01,420
Then I should leave.

492
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:04,900
That's not what I meant.

493
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:06,980
You wrote a lot.

494
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:08,140
Is your arm tired?

495
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:09,220
Let me hold this for you.

496
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:13,540
Their connections
are tangled like a spiderweb

497
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:15,380
Why is it so complicated?

498
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:17,340
Hon Fui-lung?

499
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:20,020
This sounds like a bad guy's name.

500
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:21,620
Hon, Fui, and Lung.

501
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:36,940
Hello?

502
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:38,540
Mr. Chun,

503
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:39,740
it's Lo Wai-tak.

504
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:41,100
I heard

505
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:43,060
you did excellently in the interview.

506
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:44,060
Congratulations.

507
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:45,740
Is there anything special?

508
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:46,980
I received a letter.

509
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,020
It's about

510
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:49,060
that you were questioned

511
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:51,060
by the police about half a year ago.

512
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:52,380
It was

513
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:54,140
right after your wife's suicide.

514
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:56,340
The police thought you were suspicious

515
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:58,220
and investigated you.

516
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:00,500
You're trying hard to dig up my flaws

517
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:02,860
so that I will withdraw
from the election of the chief justice.

518
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:06,060
It was a routine investigation
from the police.

519
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:08,020
I was proven innocent.

520
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:10,220
That is

521
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:11,540
not the point.

522
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:12,340
The point is

523
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:14,460
you were once suspected.

524
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:16,860
The candidate for the chief justice

525
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:18,060
was once

526
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:19,740
a suspect in the death of his wife.

527
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:23,380
I will not drop out
because of your threat.

528
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:26,260
In that case,

529
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:28,060
I will hand the letter to the media.

530
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:30,460
Do it.

531
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:35,700
Mr. Pang,

532
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:36,700
where's Wai?

533
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:37,660
Where's he?

534
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:39,940
I saved him.

535
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:41,700
I did my best.

536
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:43,180
As for the rest,

537
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,060
ask Chi Cheung-wing.

538
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:46,900
You sold me out?

539
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:49,620
You have your husband and kids,

540
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:51,100
and I have my wife and kids, too!

541
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:52,620
I need to protect them.

542
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:54,580
Of all the people,

543
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:56,620
why would you cross
that horrible scoundrel?

544
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:02,980
[Chun Yue, Father and Son, Chun Yat-wai]

545
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:04,020
To stop me from taking his son

546
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:05,500
to the police for investigation,

547
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:07,980
he framed me
for having a connection with the gangs.

548
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:09,340
Because that night,

549
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:10,460
he was around my home.

550
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:11,900
He is most likely the one

551
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:13,180
who saw me meeting Hon Lit.

552
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:14,260
Then,

553
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:16,580
since Chow Lok-man's always
had a problem with me,

554
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:18,580
he used her and let her
report me at Complaints Office.

555
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:19,940
He lied to me

556
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:20,740
and gave a false statement.

557
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:22,940
He used Chow Lok-man to interfere.

558
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:24,980
The only reason he did all these

559
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:26,700
is to protect his son.

560
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:28,740
Because from the very beginning,

561
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:30,540
he knew his son was the murderer

562
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:31,740
of the hit-and-run.

563
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:37,100
All in all,

564
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:38,900
aim for the weak spot.

565
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:40,540
Make it count in one strike

566
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:42,620

00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:45,060
was the one who hit and ran.

569
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:50,060
Also, Tong Huen,

570
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:52,140
you need to

571
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:54,100
take care of yourself.

572
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:56,020
There's no need to get yourself into it.

573
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:04,020
[Hokong Courts of Final Appeal
and Second Instance Building]

574
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:05,420
The judge,

575
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:07,220
Chun Yue, the candidate

576
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:08,060
of the chief justice

577
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:09,060
was once the suspect

578
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:10,860
of his wife's suicide

579
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:12,340
about half a year ago.

580
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:13,660
He was investigated

581
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:15,140
and questioned by the police.

582
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:18,180
Mr. Chun,

583
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:20,820
I'm sure you read the news.

584
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:22,300
Please don't blame it on me.

585
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:23,580
The citizens

586
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:24,740
have the right to know.

587
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:27,140
I'm sure you will be the chief justice.

588
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:27,660
Congratulations.

589
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:30,900
Wait for the official announcement.

590
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:31,900
It's okay.

591
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:32,900
It has to be you.

592
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:42,420
You can say anything about me,

593
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:43,420
but leave my wife alone.

594
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:44,580
Also,

595
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:45,620
you took the photo

596
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:47,220
when my car was checked

597
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:48,860
by the police last time, right?

598
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:51,500
Was it you?

599
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:55,180
Yes, it was me.

600
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:56,620
I may not be the good guy,

601
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:57,340
but you

602
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:58,540
are a scumbag.

603
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:00,940
Yat-wai.

604
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:05,180
What's wrong, Dad?

605
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:07,340
Think carefully.

606
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:09,940
Did you get off the car

607
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:11,460
after you hit Hon Gong?

608
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:17,740
I... I walked over to him

609
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:19,860
and saw his bloody face.

610
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:24,060
I was so scared
that I had an asthma attack

611
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:25,500
and puked.

612
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:27,540
Then I went back to the car

613
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:28,820
and got the asthma inhaler.

614
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:31,380
You puked?

615
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:33,100
Yes.

616
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:35,020
Why didn't you tell me?

617
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:38,900
I don't remember, but

618
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:40,100
what's the problem?

619
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:44,060
Because the police

620
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:45,340
found an asthma inhaler

621
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:47,780
at the scene,

622
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:49,820
and it's with your DNA.

623
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:52,660
If they compare the DNA

624
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:53,220
on the asthma inhaler

625
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:55,300
with the vomit...

626
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:55,940
But

627
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:58,460
I don't have my name on the inhaler.

628
00:35:58,740 --> 00:35:59,980
How do they know it's mine?

629
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:03,460
Someone went over our bin this morning.

630
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:04,700
There was

631
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:06,900
an inhaler you used in the trash,

632
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:08,460
with your DNA.

633
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:10,740
If these things are put together,

634
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:11,860
it proves

635
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:12,940
that you

636
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:14,660
were at the scene.

637
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:23,220
Get off the car.

638
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:31,580
Wai,

639
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:34,500
I'm so upset.

640
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:36,460
Do you know why?

641
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:39,980
It's not because my men
were blown to death by you.

642
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:44,260
It's also not because I was taken
to the police station.

643
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:47,980
It's not even because Hon Lit is trying

644
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:49,580
to ruin my business.

645
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:52,380
I'm upset because of you.

646
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:56,620
You swore with your kids' life

647
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:57,780
that you would rob the weapons for me,

648
00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:00,180
but you didn't keep your word.

649
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:03,460
What kind of father are you?

650
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:07,380
I didn't lie to you.

651
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:10,300
I grabbed the weapons for you.

652
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:12,180
Then who put the bomb in the car

653
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:13,180
and tried to blow me up?

654
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:16,220
It was either you,
or the guy who delivered for you!

655
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:21,340
Who was he?

656
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:22,740
Am I supposed

657
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:25,100
to find him
and make him pay for this as well?

658
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:30,300
Who was the guy?

659
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:44,380
Grab him!

660
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:07,100
Do you want to talk?

661
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:11,260
Are you only going to speak
after I break

662
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:12,140
your other hand?

663
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:15,660
Chi Cheung-wing,

664
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:20,020
I know you won't spare me.

665
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:22,100
Just do it quick.

666
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:27,500
The cop is different, right?

667
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:29,060
With integrity.

668
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:33,020
I wonder if your dear son

669
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:34,260
is as strong as you.

670
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:36,740
Maybe I should try and find out.

671
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:40,500
Chi Cheung-wing,

672
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:43,580
you made a swear

673
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:46,460
to keep my wife and kids safe.

674
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:48,100
Leave them alone.

675
00:38:58,780 --> 00:38:59,540
Cho Wai-yi,

676
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:02,380
you were the one
who swore on your kids' lives.

677
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:05,460
Guess which side God takes.

678
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:11,820
Mr. Hon Lit,

679
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:13,180
he works for Chi Cheung-wing.

680
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:13,980
We searched.

681
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:14,740
There's no weapon.

682
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:17,420
Chi wants to talk to Mr. Hon Lit.

683
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:25,740
It's Hon Lit.

684
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:28,820
I want to have a chat with you.

685
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:30,460
What's that for?

686
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:32,060
Want to throw in the towel?

687
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:33,820
You will know when you get here.

688
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:36,260
Or are you too scared

689
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:37,540
to come to see me?

690
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:40,300
I will let you know the address.

691
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:45,660
Senior,

692
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:46,820
[Forensic Laboratory]
do you

693
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:48,260
remember checking the DNA

694
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:49,220
of an inhaler for me?

695
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:50,380
Of course,

696
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:52,700
and the sample of some vomit, right?

697
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:54,860
I suspect

698
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:56,220
this belongs to the same person.

699
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:57,740
Is it possible for you to do

700
00:39:57,740 --> 00:39:58,940
a comparative test for the DNA?

701
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:00,580
I assume you're not going to tell me

702
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:02,060
where these samples are from?

703
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:03,540
You know everything.

704
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:04,540
Alright.

705
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:05,780
I will do it as soon as possible.

706
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:06,660
Thank you so much.

707
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:08,020
Let me know when it's done.

708
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:29,340
Put away the gun.

709
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:38,620
Come over.

710
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:40,020
I got you a gift.

711
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:43,220
Come on.

712
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:07,500
You don't know him, do you?

713
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:10,540
Introduce yourself to Mr. Hon Lit now!

714
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:16,860
He is Cho Wai-yi.

715
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:18,300
He used to be a cop.

716
00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:19,860
After he was fired,

717
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:21,220
he started doing smuggling.

718
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:22,700
You didn't ask me here

719
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:24,700
to introduce a friend

720
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:25,540
to me, right?

721
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:28,500
I heard your brother is awake.

722
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:31,140
It's good that he got his life back

723
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:32,180
from the God of Death.

724
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:34,900
I guess you don't know the truth

725
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:36,060
of your brother's accident,

726
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:38,540
but he does.

727
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:41,420
Tell him.

728
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:46,580
Wake up!

729
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:48,540
Tell him who did it.

730
00:41:58,420 --> 00:41:59,660
It's Chun Yue...

731
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:03,740
The judge?

732
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:06,940
It's his son

733
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:08,980
who hit your brother.

734
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:13,700
You killed Ma San-po

735
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:15,420
and hurt my man Hung

736
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:16,980
with burning oil.

737
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:17,980
How do we settle this?

738
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:19,700
You also burned my men to death,

739
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:22,300
and you took the guns.

740
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:24,620
Don't forget about the explosives
that almost killed you.

741
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:26,260
You started this.

742
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:28,860
Don't call it even

743
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:30,620
just because of this guy.

744
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:33,140
I will settle it down with you

745
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:34,100
sooner or later.

746
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:36,940
At least I don't get fooled.

747
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:39,100
Now we're clear about your brother.

748
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:41,180
It has nothing to do with the old town.

749
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:42,420
As for the rest,

750
00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:43,980
we will deal with it later.

751
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:46,260
Also,

752
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:48,580
what do you want to do with this guy?

753
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:54,660
Whatever.

754
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:08,580
Chi Cheung-wing,

755
00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:12,020
don't forget

756
00:43:13,780 --> 00:43:16,100
that you swore

757
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:19,460
that you would
keep my wife and kids safe.

758
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:23,940
If you break your promise,

759
00:43:25,220 --> 00:43:27,060
you'll get struck by lightning.

760
00:43:49,620 --> 00:43:50,780
I want to say a few words.

761
00:43:53,580 --> 00:43:54,660
I reported you.

762
00:43:55,220 --> 00:43:55,820
I know.

763
00:43:58,580 --> 00:43:59,340
What you are doing

764
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:01,740
is enough for me to report you
for harassing a witness.

765
00:44:03,860 --> 00:44:05,060
I wasn't looking for you.

766
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:06,540
I was waiting for someone here,

767
00:44:06,740 --> 00:44:08,420
and you happened to see me after work.

768
00:44:10,780 --> 00:44:11,700
What do you want to say?

769
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:14,980
I know Ma San-po was not the murderer.

770
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:18,460
You finally admitted

771
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:19,980
that you got the wrong guy.

772
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:20,900
Yes,

773
00:44:21,580 --> 00:44:22,620
we got the wrong guy,

774
00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:24,180
but it was because

775
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:25,260
someone around us

776
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:26,740
was misleading us all the time.

777
00:44:27,580 --> 00:44:28,580
By us,

778
00:44:29,060 --> 00:44:29,860
I mean you

779
00:44:30,020 --> 00:44:30,780
and me.

780
00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:32,780
If you want justice

781
00:44:32,780 --> 00:44:33,700
for Ma San-po,

782
00:44:34,060 --> 00:44:35,020
you should step forward

783
00:44:35,020 --> 00:44:35,860
and expose the one

784
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:37,980
who sacrificed Ma San-po as a scapegoat.

785
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:45,500
So you knew.

786
00:44:48,860 --> 00:44:50,460
I don't know what you are talking about.

787
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:52,340
It doesn't matter.

788
00:44:53,220 --> 00:44:54,100
What matters

789
00:44:54,540 --> 00:44:56,300
is that I know the answer now.

790
00:44:57,780 --> 00:44:58,780
You will see

791
00:44:58,940 --> 00:45:00,540
how I put the one responsible
behind bars

792
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:02,380
and get justice for Ma San-po.

793
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:03,780
Isn't it

794
00:45:04,340 --> 00:45:06,300
