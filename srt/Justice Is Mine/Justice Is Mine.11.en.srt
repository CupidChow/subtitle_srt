Mr. Chun,

00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:13,740
why would your son

00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:15,090
enter Hon Gong's room

00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:19,260
And the car that hit Hon Gong

6
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:20,330
is your car.

7
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:22,050
Don't you think

00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,140
there's some related?

9
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:25,840

that you misled her on purpose.

sooner or later.

you should know.

194
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:47,260
You can withdraw the injunction

195
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:48,460
with medical treatment as a reason.

196
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:50,100
But I won't do that.

197
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:53,580
Am I not being clear enough?

198
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:56,420
I did skip one or two steps,

199
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:56,860
but

200
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:58,380
it was not without precedent.

201
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:01,220
One of the duties of the court
is to assist the police.

202
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:02,820
As long as

203
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:03,900
he presents the evidence later,

204
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:04,980
everything

205
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:06,100
is fair and legal.

206
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,340
What if the evidence is not sufficient?

207
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,460
Then that's not my responsibility.

208
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:14,780
If my son's treatment is delayed,

209
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:16,340
and he gets more and more serious,

210
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:17,420
even facing

211
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:18,900
risk of death,

212
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:20,540
the responsibility is definitely on you.

213
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:23,580
I will make a complaint,

214
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,100
and you will be

215
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:27,060
the most cold-blooded, inhumane judge.

216
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:29,420
Is it going to help you

217
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:31,780
run for the chief justice?

218
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:42,420
Sometimes, investigation

219
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:44,250
really needs some luck.

220
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:47,820
From a humanitarian
point of view, though,

221
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:53,770
medical treatment is essential.

222
00:13:59,540 --> 00:13:59,940
Thank you.

223
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:17,940
Wai is missing.

224
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:19,250
What?

225
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:20,580
Are you sure?

226
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:23,370
They said Chi Cheung-wing took Wai.

227
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:25,460
I went to his place, but

228
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:27,460
he never came back.

229
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:31,850
Hello?

230
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:33,420
Don't you always have a solution?

231
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:34,610
Say something!

232
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,770
You got Wai into this.

233
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:39,610
You can't leave him like that!

234
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:42,220
Where are you?

235
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,370
I'm home.

236
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:46,820
I was hoping for a miracle,

237
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:47,820
but there wasn't.

238
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:50,490
Wai didn't come back.

239
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:53,890
Alright. I will be right there.

240
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:13,340
Yat-wai,

241
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:15,020
now you can leave,

242
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:21,780
but I still have something to do.

243
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:23,140
Stay in the room and wait for me.

244
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:27,500
Hello? Yat-wai?

245
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:29,980
I heard you.

246
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:42,900
Did she really wait for me
for the entire day?

247
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:43,300
Yes.

248
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:46,490
Fix it. It's out of battery.

249
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:06,700
Hello?

250
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:07,890
Chi Cheung-wing,

251
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,100
you finally answered my call.

252
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:12,940
You can always come to my place.

253
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:14,890
I can't go there right now.

254
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:15,700
Let's talk somewhere else.

255
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:17,700
Where?

256
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:20,060
Do you remember Tai Wong Temple?

257
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:22,180
Of course.

258
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:24,490
We watched ritual operas a lot there
when we were kids.

259
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:25,580
I remember you...

260
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:27,020
Good. See you later.

261
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:40,220
Yes?

262
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:42,650
Yat-wai, it's Grandma.

263
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:48,820
Yat-wai.

264
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:50,770
Grandma, come in.

265
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:58,700
Yat-wai,

266
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,250
why are you here?

267
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:01,980
What happened?

268
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:02,820
Grandma,

269
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:05,180
I need to tell you something.

270
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:12,980
Sa.

271
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:16,780
[Pray for good weather for the crops]

272
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:20,420
You know why I'm looking for you.

273
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,380
What happened to your eyes?

274
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:24,530
You cried?

275
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:29,140
I want to offer an incense stick

276
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,660
for the safety of Wai.

277
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:36,420
Sure.

278
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:40,050
Chi,

279
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:41,380
no one is there.

280
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:42,250
It's clear.

281
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,250
Suet, you two stay here.

282
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:45,770
Got it.

283
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:07,770
I want to ask you one question
in front of all the gods.

284
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:09,250
You need to answer me honestly.

285
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,570
Is that why you asked me

286
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:14,580
to meet here?

287
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,140
Where is Wai?

288
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:22,290
He is safe.

289
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:25,490
Where is he?

290
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,980
He got himself into trouble.

291
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:33,860
I helped him make a getaway.

292
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:35,810
Did he leave

293
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:38,980
without telling me?

294
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:41,810
He left

295
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:43,570
and asked me to take care of you.

296
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,050
You? Take care of me?

297
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,010
We are all from the old town.

298
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:51,900
What's the problem with that?

299
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:56,420
You said a getaway.

300
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,220
Where did he go?

301
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:02,380
When it's all settled down,

302
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:03,700
I will tell you.

303
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:04,940
That's all I can say.

304
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:10,250
Then call him now.

305
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:11,860
I need to speak to him.

306
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,250
Why do you care about him now?

307
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:19,980
Didn't you take the kids
and return to your parents' place?

308
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:23,290
Wai is a loser.

309
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:25,010
He got into trouble

310
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:26,420
and left without you.

311
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:27,770
End of story.

312
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:29,380
Where is Wai?

313
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:32,900
Where?

314
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:36,660
She is his wife.

315
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:38,180
You should ask her.

316
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,180
Where is he?

317
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:48,330
Do you know who you hit?

318
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:52,980
There weren't a lot of people
or cars in that street.

319
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,770
It was probably a homeless.

320
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:58,140
But for some reason, I didn't

321
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,980
think about stopping at the time.

322
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:03,220
Running away doesn't mean
you are a bad person.

323
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:05,380
Most of the time, it's out of instinct.

324
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:06,460
Fear

325
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:07,770
makes people panic,

326
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:09,900
especially for young men like you.

327
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:11,730
The court will take these
into consideration.

328
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:16,700
Why didn't your father
take you to turn yourself in?

329
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:17,700
He did,

330
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:19,530
but I was too scared.

331
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,420
So what he is doing now

332
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:23,250
is all because of me.

333
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:24,660
Where is he now?

334
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:36,380
Yat-wai,

335
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:39,250
a secret like this

00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:42,180

337
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:42,900
Yes,

338
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:46,900

346
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:18,860
Over there.

347
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:26,420
Where?

348
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:41,140
Dig it up.

349
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:42,460

384
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:48,250
Ms. Sum Ning.

385
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:53,810
Mr. Chun Yat-wai,

386
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:55,250
could you please

387
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:56,810
try to recall the accident

388
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:58,340
and tell us everything in detail.

389
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:07,090
I just got my driver's license.

390
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:11,420
There weren't a lot of cars that day,

391
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:13,180
so I tried to speed up.

392
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:15,420
But then, a car wanted to overtake me.

393
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:18,090
I was at the slow lane on the left,

394
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:19,940
so I focused all my attention
on the right.

395
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:22,330
I didn't expect him
to overtake from the left.

396
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:26,460
And then...

397
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:27,810
I hit him.

398
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:30,140
Yat-wai,

399
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:32,700
didn't you say you hit a homeless?

400
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,420
Why are you saying you hit a car now?

401
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:41,530
I got it wrong.

402
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:43,620
After the accident,

403
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:45,220
did you tell anyone

404
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:46,530
other than Ms. Sum?

405
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:47,810
No.

406
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:50,260
I

407
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:51,420
immediately drove the car

408
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:52,460
home

409
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:53,860
and hid in my room.

410
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:58,090
I didn't tell anyone,

411
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:01,940
not even my father.

412
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:05,700
Let me repeat what you said.

413
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:07,620
You just got your license.

414
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:10,290
You were driving
on the left lane on that day.

415
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:13,010
The car behind you suddenly sped up,
trying to overtake.

416
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:14,010
You were scared.

417
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:15,810
When the car tried to overtake,

418
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:17,180
there was a collision.

419
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:19,330
You were so scared

420
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:20,220
that you didn't stop.

421
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:21,570
You drove home straightaway,

422
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:22,700
and you didn't tell anyone

423
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:24,460
after you got home.

424
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:25,860
Later, the car was stolen.

425
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:27,420
This is your statement.

426
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:28,380
Is there any problem?

427
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:33,770
So after the accident,

428
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:35,060
you just left. Am I right?

429
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:43,020
I didn't know what to do.

430
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:45,220
Did you get out of the car?

431
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:56,060
Did you try to approach the injured?

432
00:27:58,660 --> 00:27:59,300
No.

433
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:03,980
Do you remember

434
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:04,620
what car it was?

435
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:09,180
It was a motorcycle.

436
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:12,770
According to the records,

437
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:15,380
there was only
one traffic accident on that day.

438
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:16,420
It was a collision between a private car

439
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:17,780
and a motorcycle.

440
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:19,740
The private car driver fled the scene,

441
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:20,860
and the motorcycle driver
was severely injured

442
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:21,700
and went into a coma.

443
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:23,250
He was not a homeless,

444
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:25,220
but the son of Hon Fui-lung

445
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:26,420
from the Hon family,

446
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:27,050
Hon Gong.

447
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:28,940
Stop. Wait a second.

448
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:31,700
I need to talk to my client.

449
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:33,330
Please stop asking.

450
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:48,700
Mr. Chun,

451
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,180
I heard your son turned himself in.

452
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:00,980
I applied for the exit injunction.

453
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:04,140
I know,

454
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:06,570
and you are the one who stalked me.

455
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:10,180
I thought you were

456
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:12,290
the wisest man

457
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:13,380
I know.

458
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:15,330
I never expect you

459
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:16,660
to do something so stupid.

460
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:19,140
This is

461
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:21,570
the result of the DNA test.

462
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:23,940
The saliva trace

463
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:25,810
from the asthma inhaler at the scene

464
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:27,220
perfectly matches

465
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,180
the DNA

466
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:29,940
of a recent suspect.

467
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:31,290
Let me tell you.

468
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:33,660
If the evidence

469
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:34,700
is collected illegally,

470
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:36,290
such as going through my trash,

471
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:38,530
it cannot be admitted.

472
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:41,980
Of course, Mr. Chun,

473
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:44,530
but since the suspect
has turned himself in,

474
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:46,900
I can request sampling again.

475
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:48,330
The result

476
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:51,330
will be the same.

477
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:01,010
Yat-wai,

478
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:02,180
why did you

479
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,490
lie to me?

480
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:08,420
I was afraid that if you knew who I hit,

481
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:09,900
you would stop me
from turning myself in.

482
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:13,900
I really want to speak up...

483
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:16,860
I don't want to put
anyone at risk anymore.

484
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:24,380
I...

485
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:25,810
I don't need a lawyer.

486
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:31,250
I can take up
the responsibility on my own.

487
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:42,570
I get it.

488
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:44,330
You are a grown-up.

489
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:46,420
You can make your own decision.

490
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:48,900
But I will still stay with you.

491
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:51,100
I will protect your rights

492
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:52,620
through legal means.

493
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:55,140
Don't be afraid.

494
00:30:59,100 --> 00:30:59,420
Alright.

495
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:00,700
You may continue.

496
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:03,260
Continue.

497
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:14,340
Yat-wai.

498
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:15,660
Yat-wai.

499
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:16,740
Stop, Mr. Chun.

500
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:17,620
It's okay.

501
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:18,620
It's okay.

502
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:19,980
Son,

503
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:22,300
it's fine.

504
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:23,300
Don't be scared.

505
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:23,940
I'm here.

506
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:25,060
Dad,

507
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:27,620
I told them what happened.

508
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:31,420
It's my own responsibility.

509
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:33,140
It has nothing to do with you.

510
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:38,860
What are you charging him with?

511
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:41,220
Chun Yat-wai violated
the Road Traffic Law

512
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:42,260
and has been officially charged

513
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:44,380
with evasion of responsibility.

514
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:46,300
I want to bail him out.

515
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:47,900
Did you apply for bail?

516
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:49,420
Don't you think I tried?

517
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:50,340
It's rejected.

518
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:52,900
Considering there is a flight risk,

519
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:54,500
he cannot be bailed

520
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:56,060
during this period.

521
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:58,020
We will have him

522
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:00,460
in custody immediately.

523
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:05,780
Take him away.

524
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:06,940
Yes, sir.

525
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:08,700
Don't worry.

526
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:10,100
I will figure it out.

527
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:11,220
Trust me.

528
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:13,020
Trust me. It's okay.

529
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:15,900
Trust me.

530
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:19,620
Go.

531
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:32,180
I have something to ask you.

532
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:33,700
We will talk back home.

533
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:49,140
Tong Huen,

534
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:55,580
didn't I tell you earlier

535
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:56,820
to leave this case alone

536
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:59,220
when you are on leave?

537
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:02,020
But you did help me

538
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:02,540
get the exit injunction.

539
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:05,220
I took an action based on a source,

540
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:06,700
but you exercised police authority

541
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:08,180
without permission.

542
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:10,100
Do you want the C&IIB

543
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:11,100
to have more evidence

544
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:12,820
to charge you?

545
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:14,940
You are right.

546
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:16,260
It's my fault,

547
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:19,020
but it's worth it
if we get the right guy.

548
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:21,420
Alright.

549
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:22,900
When this case is over,

550
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:25,420
I think the C&IIB will see

551
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:26,340
your capability

552
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:28,620
and stop picking on you.

553
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:30,300
This case is far from over.

554
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:32,540
Chun Yue had been misleading me.

555
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:34,540
Stop coming up
with new problems, alright?

556
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:36,780
The son said it.

557
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:38,820
His father didn't know a thing,

558
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:39,860
and

559
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:41,380
you have no evidence to show

560
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:42,460
Chun Yue is part of it.

561
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:43,500
If you let me back in,

562
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:44,860
I can go find the evidence.

563
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:45,980
This case

564
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:47,180
has always been mine anyway.

565
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:50,100
Fine.

566
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:51,260
I can let you back in,

567
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:52,940
but promise me,

568
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:54,660
stop targeting Chun Yue.

569
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:56,620
I don't want others

570
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:58,100
to think you have ulterior motives.

571
00:33:58,140 --> 00:33:58,940
Do you understand?

572
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:01,020
I won't let him get away so easily.

573
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:06,700
Did you ask Yat-wai to turn himself in?

574
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:09,060
You answer me first.

575
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:11,100
Did you ask Yat-wai

576
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:13,460
to hide and lie, including to me?

577
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:16,140
He hit the son of Hon Fui-lung.

578
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:18,540
If he gets sentenced,

579
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:20,460
do you think he can survive?

580
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:25,340
He came to me.

581
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:28,140
He regretted it,
and he was blaming himself.

582
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:30,540
He wanted to take responsibility
for his own mistake.

583
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:32,020
That's not wrong, either.

584
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:33,580
Isn't that the right way?

585
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:36,260
You were

586
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:38,060
acting so strange previously.

587
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:40,180
Now it all makes sense.

588
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:43,500
Let me ask you one more thing.

589
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:45,660
You need to answer me honestly.

590
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:48,500
Did you do anything illegal

591
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:51,660
or drag innocent people into it

592
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:53,740

I canceled my leave

632
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:15,490
and is now in charge of this case again.

633
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:18,980
You didn't ask me
to go to the police station,

634
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:20,640
which means

635
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:21,980
this is not official.

636
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:24,320
I just want to get a few things clear,

637
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:27,040
so that I won't get the direction wrong.

638
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:28,620
It will be fairer

639
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:29,660
for your son, too.

640
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:31,090
What do you think?

641
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:33,820
Back then,

642
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:35,500
you were very sure that Ma San-po

643
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:36,380
stole your car,

644
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:37,900
but now,

645
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:39,900
your son turned himself in

646
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:42,130
and said he hit Hon Gong.

647
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:43,980
Could you explain that?

648
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:45,300
Sure.

649
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:46,540
Listen carefully.

650
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:48,820
I told you

651
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:50,300
that I saw Ma San-po

652
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:51,220
around my house.

653
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:54,020
It was the police who reckoned Ma San-po

654
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:54,940
stole the car.

655
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:55,980
It had nothing to do with me.

656
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:57,420
Are you happy

657
00:37:57,780 --> 00:37:58,460
with this answer?

658
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:00,300
I showed you a surveillance photo

659
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:01,940
that Chun Yat-wai
appeared in the hospital.

660
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:03,100
You promised me

661
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:04,980
to bring him to the police station
to assist the investigation,

662
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:06,460
but soon after,

663
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:08,140
I was reported

664
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:09,620
and faced an internal investigation.

665
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:11,380
On the night I met Hon Lit,

666
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:12,700
you also had a meeting with me.

667
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:13,940
You told me

668
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:15,420
that you were already around my place,

669
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:16,940
which means you are

670
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:18,260
the most likely person who saw

671
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:19,540
I met Hon Lit.

672
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:21,420
Yet, the one who reported me

673
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:22,740
was Ms. Chow Lok-man.

674
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:25,180
Do you honestly have no idea about it?

675
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:27,420
Are these all coincidences?

676
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:36,100
The reporting system maintains

677
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:37,180
strict confidentiality

678
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:38,580
for anyone who reports.

679
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:40,220
You should not reveal

680
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:41,340
it to anyone.

681
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:43,620
As a judge,

682
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:44,820
I should not let it slide.

683
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:46,180
However, considering

684
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:47,860
this is informal,

685
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:49,620
I can ignore

686
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:51,220
everything you just said.

687
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:52,980
I should remind you though

688
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:54,860
that violating
the confidentiality policy

689
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:56,780
carries disciplinary consequences.

690
00:38:58,620 --> 00:38:59,900
The statement from Chun Yat-wai

691
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:01,700
is very clear about the time

692
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:03,380
and location of the accident,

693
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:04,820
but on the same night,

694
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:06,700
you came to the station personally

695
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:07,740
to report the missing of the car.

696
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:10,140
Based on the records,

697
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:11,780
you said the car was stolen

698
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:13,460
around 10 o'clock in the morning.

699
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:15,380
I want to know how you found out

700
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:16,980
the car was stolen around 10.

701
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:18,740
I want to figure out

702
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:20,100
the difference

703
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:22,420
between what you said and the statement

704
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:24,020
from your son Chun Yat-wai.

705
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:26,300
He is my son,

706
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:29,060
so unless you voluntarily
show me the statement

707
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:30,460
and let me see that he didn't

708
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:32,580
make his statement when he was misled.

709
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:33,860
Otherwise,

710
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:35,620
I will invoke my right to immunity

711
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:38,140
to avoid making any statement
that might be prejudicial to him.

712
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:41,380
Impressive, Mr. Chun.

713
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:43,780
Thank you for your time.

714
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:48,220
It's not done.

715
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:50,500
I will be back.

I want to celebrate

00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:03,140
the end of your case

00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:09,740
We got the guy, but

731
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:12,340
someone who helped is still out there.

732
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:14,700
Chun Yue is a judge,

733
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:16,620
and he has been a good judge.

734
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:17,740
Don't forget

735
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:19,140
that you trusted him so much before.

736
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:20,700
You even hurt your hand

737
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:21,660
in order to protect him.

738
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:24,420
It doesn't mean he can break the law.

739
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:26,780
He didn't break the law.

740
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:28,300
He simply

741
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:29,780
took advantage of the legal system

742
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:31,220
and made it

743
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:32,500
be in his favor.

744
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:34,260
It's being smart,

745
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:35,380
and being smart is not against the law.

746
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:38,340
But he dragged
innocent people into this.

747
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:41,380
The court

748
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:42,820
is all about evidence.

749
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:45,460
It's not about morality or conscience.

750
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:48,460
Why are you defending him?

751
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:50,220
I think highly of him,

752
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:53,180
but more importantly,
I want you to put it down.

753
00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:56,340
Stop talking about me.

754
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:57,540
How are you?

755
00:41:58,220 --> 00:41:59,620

756

Any updates?

757
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:05,780
I keep in touch with him.

758
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:08,140
He is still considering

759
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:09,700
about the operation.

760
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:12,660
You said it was late-stage cancer.

761
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:13,700
So

762
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:14,620
is it possible...

763
00:42:14,620 --> 00:42:15,220
Yes.

764
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:17,180
So it's really difficult

765
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:18,660
to talk about
other things with him now.

766
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:22,300
If this lead is also running cold...

767
00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:22,660
Hey,

768
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:24,260
we should stop talking about these.

769
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:25,620
Let's get to the business.

770
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:26,940
I want you to learn this song.

771
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:29,260
There are two parts,

772
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:30,260
and if you learn it,

773
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:32,220
I can be the backing vocal.

774
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:33,700
Isn't that romantic?

775
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:35,940
Me?

776
00:42:35,980 --> 00:42:36,340
Yes.

777
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:37,820
I need a lot of time.

778
00:42:38,620 --> 00:42:39,380
It's okay.

779
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:41,140
Just give it a try.

780
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:42,180
Try it.

781
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:43,660
There is something.

782
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:46,700
Did you hear it?

783
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:48,580
Check what's inside for me.

784
00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:49,940
I spent ten thousand on this guitar.

785
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:50,820
Nice.

786
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:51,380
Check it yourself.

787
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:52,020
Wait. Help me.

788
00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:53,260
I need to tidy things up.

789
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:53,900
Hey.

790
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:14,860
You are here.

791
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:23,740
Thank you.

792
00:43:23,740 --> 00:43:24,300
Here you go.

793
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:29,700
Ms. Sum,

794
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:32,220
I want to say

795
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:35,500
that to this point,

796
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:37,700
my role as a father

797
00:43:38,100 --> 00:43:39,100
and my role as a judge

798
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:40,940
are overlapping.

799
00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:43,420
However, no matter

800
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:45,020
which role I'm in, I decided

801
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:46,660
to protect Yat-wai.

802
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:48,260
That's why I hope

803
00:43:49,780 --> 00:43:50,860
that you can stop asking certain things.

804
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:53,300
You and me

805
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:55,100
are the only families of Yat-wai.

806
00:43:56,540 --> 00:43:57,820
Without your help,

807
00:43:59,180 --> 00:44:00,220
I can hardly do anything for him.

808
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:04,380
I can do anything

809
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:06,020
for the sake of Yat-wai.

810
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:09,060
Okay.

811
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:09,900
Wait a second.

812
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:17,180
You...

813
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:18,180
Where did you find it?

814
00:44:19,180 --> 00:44:20,300
I didn't.

815
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:22,140
Yat-wai did.

816
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:23,940
Yat-wai?

817
00:44:47,620 --> 00:44:47,940
Lok-man,

818
00:44:48,940 --> 00:44:49,540
what's wrong?

819
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:52,020
I heard the news.

820
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:54,340
Your son turned himself in.

821
00:44:55,140 --> 00:44:55,900
How about you?

822
00:44:59,340 --> 00:45:00,420
Everyone should pay

823
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:01,740
for the mistakes they make.

824
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:04,500
How can you be the exception?

825
00:45:06,180 --> 00:45:07,100
Is that because

826
00:45:08,660 --> 00:45:09,940
you are a judge?

827
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:12,900
I trusted you blindly,

828
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:14,220
and I'm going to pay for that.

829
00:45:16,340 --> 00:45:17,620
I will stop taking any cases for now

830
00:45:18,020 --> 00:45:19,180
and leave.

831
00:45:20,860 --> 00:45:22,060
I'm going to think about

832
00:45:22,660 --> 00:45:24,140
how I can keep going on this path.

833
00:45:24,740 --> 00:45:25,340
Lok-man,

834
00:45:26,020 --> 00:45:26,940
it's not necessary.

835
00:45:29,980 --> 00:45:30,660
Justice

836
00:45:32,260 --> 00:45:33,620
is the core of the rule of law.

837
00:45:35,620 --> 00:45:36,140
Rule of law

838
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:39,740
is the basis of social order
and stability.

839
00:45:41,100 --> 00:45:43,260
It protects the rights and freedom

840
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:44,100
of every citizens.

841
00:45:46,220 --> 00:45:46,940
It protects us

842
00:45:47,860 --> 00:45:49,820
from violence and oppression.

843
00:45:51,820 --> 00:45:52,700
It stands

844
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:54,220
for fairness,

845
00:45:55,100 --> 00:45:56,420
justice, and equality.

846
00:46:00,540 --> 00:46:02,900
It is the moral standard of the society.

847
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:08,460
You taught me all these.

848
00:46:14,540 --> 00:46:16,180
I hope you can teach yourself as well.

849
00:46:18,020 --> 00:46:19,180
Ask yourself

850
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:22,540
if you still deserve to be a judge.
