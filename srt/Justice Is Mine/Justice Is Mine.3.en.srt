Why wouldn't he cooperate?

00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,570
Maybe I'm overthinking.

did Ma San-po say anything to you?

44

to the police?

49
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:24,780
It's the same.

50

He wouldn't say a thing.

51
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:29,010
Maybe it's because

197
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:37,940
that both of us

in our circles.

It's from my notebook.

Can you explain this to me?

Remember,

And Ma San-po too.

00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:32,620

266
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:34,660

we can't entirely dismiss it.

That is, one of our people

00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:57,620

00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:02,580
You saw the bruises on his face

383
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:04,820
last time in court.

384
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:08,660
Get him bailed out,

385
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:11,060
and that'll stop him
from getting beaten.

386
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:14,780
You're his uncle.

387
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,060
If you really care about him,

388
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:18,380
you should ask his mother

389
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:19,900
to step forward as his guardian

390
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:21,420
and file a formal complaint
to the court,

391
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:23,300
accusing the police of excessive force.

392
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:26,460
Who's the lawyer here?

393
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:29,580
If I have to do everything on my own,

394
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:31,180
what did I pay you for?

395
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:36,060
I've done my part.

396
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:38,780
But Ma San-po refuses to cooperate.

397
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:40,820
I want to know

398
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:43,260
who told him to shut up.

399
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:51,980
If you know anything else,

400
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:53,020
please do tell me.

401
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:56,740
Ma San-po is 18 years old.
He's still young.

402
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:58,380
He's being treated horribly inside.

403
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:00,300
Don't you feel for him as family?

404
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:12,460
Please do everything you can for him.

405
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:31,140
Wai.

406
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:33,100
Do you know

407
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:34,100
Po has been beaten in custody?

408
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:38,300
You were a cop.

409
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:40,060
You know this happens a lot.

410
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:41,580
Maybe Po

411
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:42,940
got into trouble inside.

412
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:45,060
You know the police

413
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:46,740
are particularly harsh
on those from the old town.

414
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:48,980
The police don't like them.

415
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:51,300
They don't like the police either.

416
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:52,780
Wai,

417
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:55,060
make sure to remind Po

418
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:56,540
to say nothing.

419
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:57,980
Let the lawyer handle it.

420
00:20:57,980 --> 00:20:59,460
Po will not blurt anything out.

421
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:02,300
If he betrays to the police,

422
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:04,540
he'll never be able
to face anyone again.

423
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:11,220
Why did you want to take the car apart?

424
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:13,460
Don't ask me that again, okay?

425
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:14,380
Why can't I ask?

426
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:16,460
I was dismissed,

427
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:18,500
but I have my principles.

428
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:20,300
Are you hiding something from me?

429
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:26,980
Either tell me about it,

430
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:29,300
or explain it to the police yourself.

431
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:39,060
Yes.

432
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,100
I was wrong this time.

433
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:44,060
I really was wrong.

434
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:45,500
Just say it.

435
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:49,300
Okay.

436
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:50,460
You know

437
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:52,100
Sai Wan Road has just opened.

438
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:54,540
I got careless

439
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:55,380
and sped.

440
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:56,980
I got caught on camera.

441
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:59,980
Speeding would cost you
nothing but points.

442
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:00,700
That's right.

443
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:03,540
But the limit was 80.

444
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:04,780
I was doing 130.

445
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:06,100
Worst of all,

446
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:07,500
I was really busy at that time

447
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:10,220
and forgot to get my car inspected
before the expiration.

448
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:12,540
You know I'm competing

449
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:13,700
for Chief Justice.

450
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:15,740
If the media

451
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:16,820
exposes this,

452
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:18,820
not only could I lose the qualification,

453
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:20,540
but my professional reputation

454
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:21,580
would be questioned.

455
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:23,700
That's why

456
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:25,620
I asked you to take the car apart.

457
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:28,140
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

458
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:32,020
Because I didn't want

459
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:32,860
to complicate things.

460
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:36,340
But

461
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:38,220
this has caused Po to suffer.

462
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:40,460
I feel guilty too.

463
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:44,420
What do you think

464
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:46,580
we should do now?

465
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:50,540
The biggest headache now

466
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:51,700
is your female student.

467
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:52,780
What's with her?

468
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:53,740
She's smart.

469
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:56,340
She suspected someone was silencing Po.

470
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:57,860
Now she's started suspecting me.

471
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:03,020
I don't know
how long Po can last in there.

472
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:05,260
I worry

473
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:06,740
he'll get killed inside.

474
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:11,620
Then...

475
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:15,500
should I give his family some money?

476
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:16,500
Just let me know

477
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:17,060
how much.

478
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:19,500
What's the point if he loses his life?

479
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:22,620
Your lawyer student

480
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:25,300
only knows how to dig to the root

481
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,540
and doesn't know how to save someone.

482
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:29,140
She's made everything

483
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:30,500
more complicated.

484
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:39,500
So,

485
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:40,700
what do we want to order today?

486
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:44,060
You're home and still want takeout?

487
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:47,580
Didn't you see Grandma's car outside?

488
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:50,060
If you're home,

489
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:51,740
you should eat
fresh and nutritious food.

490
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:53,700
Yat-wai,

491
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:55,260
go upstairs and do your assignments.

492
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,060
The beef brisket needs
to simmer a little longer.

493
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:05,540
Yat-wai

494
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:06,780
is fine.

495
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:09,020
I'm worried about you.

496
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:15,340
Check this.

497
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:17,380
One moment,

498
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:19,060
your car was stolen,

499
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:20,580
and the next, it was found.

500
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:23,020
Now it's seized by the police
for evidence.

501
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:24,700
You've told me nothing.

502
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:26,980
Yat-wai said you've replaced it
with a new car, right?

503
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:29,540
Not like that, it's because the old car

504
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:30,540
needed an inspection,

505
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:32,300
and fixing it afterwards
would cost a fortune.

506
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:34,580
So I just got a new car.

507
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:35,300
It's nothing.

508
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:38,300
This photo

509
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:41,020
was anonymously sent to a magazine.

510
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:42,820
A friend there

511
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:44,140
recognized my car.

512
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:45,740
So they didn't run it.

513
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:49,380
Since I became a judge,

514
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:50,580
I've been prepared

515
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:52,300
for this kind of smear.

516
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:54,740
You are prepared,

517
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:56,380
but Yat-wai isn't.

518
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:58,140
You're not just a judge.

519
00:24:58,380 --> 00:24:59,660
You're also Yat-wai's father.

520
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:03,500
Since you know I'm his dad,

521
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:04,900
can you not meddle

522
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:05,980
in between me and my son?

523
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:08,620
He is also my grandson.

524
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:10,420
If you did your job as a father,

525
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:12,380
cared for him, looked after him,

526
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:13,340
and spent time with him,

527
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:14,700
I wouldn't have to worry so much.

528
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:16,180
How have I not looked after him?

529
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:17,020
I don't need to report to you

530
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:18,580
on how I take care of him.

531
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:20,540
You don't care about

532
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:21,460
what he eats every day.

533
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:23,060
You don't know

534
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:23,780
he skipped class.

535
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:25,940
He's lost so much weight

536
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:26,900
since his mother died.

537
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,260
You still don't notice.

538
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:30,100
Is that how you care for your son?

539
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:31,500
He is 19 years old.

540
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:32,500
He's at university.

541
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:34,260
Are you still treating him like a kid?

542
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:35,460
He goes to classes,

543
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:36,420
and I go to work.

544
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:37,420
Isn't that normal?

545
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:42,700
You are

546
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:44,020
a talented judge.

547
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:46,300
That's why I let my daughter marry you.

548
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:47,820
But that doesn't mean

549
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:49,500
all your decisions are right.

550
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:52,220
You're competing for Chief Justice.

551
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:53,460
But do you realize

552
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:54,940
you'll have no personal time

553
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:56,620
if you win?

554
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:58,620
You'll spend every day in court,

555
00:25:59,060 --> 00:25:59,780
and when you get home,

556
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:01,380
you'll still be reading files
and writing judgments.

557
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:03,980
You won't even have the time
to eat takeout

558
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:04,780
with your son.

559
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:07,180
I've been there.

560
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:09,220
No one knows better than I do

561
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:11,980
how hard it is to be both a good judge

562
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:13,900
and a good dad.

563
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:15,940
You're not a judge anymore.

564
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:17,100
This isn't the courtroom.

565
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:18,100
Just because you can't manage it

566
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:19,100
doesn't mean I can't.

567
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:25,820
Sorry.

568
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,820
When the beef is ready,
get Yat-wai to eat.

569
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:03,340
I shouldn't have fought
with your grandma.

570
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:06,660
I know she was looking out for us.

571
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:09,740
Your mom's gone.

572
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:12,980
She could always sort things out.

573
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:15,660
Even if I wanted to snap,

574
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:17,820
I couldn't.

575
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:26,420
Are you mad at your mom?

576
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:29,740
I'm a bit mad at her.

577
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:32,540
I really don't understand

578
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:35,460
why she left us like that.

579
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:37,820
This family

580
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:39,420
just fell apart.

581
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:40,220
Mom...

582
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:41,180
Let's go

583
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:42,460
and see a movie.

584
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:44,700
I'll buy you a pair of new sneakers.

585
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:45,740
Maybe next time.

586
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:48,060
I'm going to class.

587
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:10,060
Mr. Chun,

588
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:11,540
what brings you here?

589
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:20,820
We didn't release

590
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:22,020
any related photos.

591
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:24,300
I've been cooperative

592
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:25,380
with the police.

593
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:27,820
I said

594
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:29,100
we didn't do it.

595
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:30,340
Besides,

596
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:31,420
why would I do that

597
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:33,380
to offend a judge

598
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:35,020
I've worked with for years?

599
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:39,900
Who do you suspect then?

600
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:44,420
What's wrong with this car?

601
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:46,380
Sorry, Mr. Lo,

602
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:47,380
no comment.

603
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:49,420
That car

604
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:50,620
belongs to Mr. Chun, right?

605
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:52,380
Please cooperate.

606
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:57,700
Mr. Lo Wai-tak,

607
00:29:58,260 --> 00:29:59,820
the one competing with you
for Chief Justice.

608
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:02,420
What reason would he have?

609
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:03,900
On the day of the search,

610
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:05,500
he had passed by the scene.

611
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:07,100
He recognized your car

612
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:08,500
and lingered around the park

613
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:10,220
with his assistant for a while.

614
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,180
He'd really do that.

615
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:15,820
He appeared at the scene,

616
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:17,540
and he had a motive.

617
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:20,500
Sorry.

618
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:24,380
It's natural to search for truth

619
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:25,460
when there's suspicion.

620
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:26,900
However,

621
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:29,780
I'm only telling you what I saw.

622
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:31,540
But if you tell others

623
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:32,980
that I told you,

624
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:33,820
sorry,

625
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:34,900
I'll deny it.

626
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:35,940
Sure.

627
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:38,460
I can catch a mole in the police,

628
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:39,980
but a rat in the court

629
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:41,900
is not my business.

630
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:42,980
Okay.

631
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:54,020
Chun Yat-wai.

632
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:56,340
Are you coming to the match after class?

633
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:59,140
That's a deal. See you there.

634
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:07,780
Did you know Cho Wai-yi fired me?

635
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:09,020
For real?

636
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:09,980
And I think he did it

637
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:10,740
because he's nervous.

638
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:12,220
All right,

639
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:13,060
let's talk inside.

640
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:54,140
You don't need to stress about it.

641
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:55,700
Because

642
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:56,620
you'll always encounter

643
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:57,740
strange clients.

644
00:31:58,260 --> 00:31:59,980
Cho Wai-yi isn't just any client.

645
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:01,940
He's your friend.

646
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:09,740
Ma San-po is about the same age
as your son.

647
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:11,620
Think about it.

648
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:13,420
If it were your son
who got beaten today,

649
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:14,140
what would you do?

650
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:17,780
The first rule of being a lawyer

651
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:19,380
is not to be emotional

652
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:20,060
about your client.

653
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:22,940
I'm no longer your student.

654
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:25,180
You don't need to lecture me like that.

655
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:26,740
Okay.

656
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:28,660
I'm only saying the truth.

657
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:30,220
Now your sympathy

658
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:32,140
is affecting your judgement.

659
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:34,140
Remember,

660
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:36,260
you are a lawyer, not a social worker.

661
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:39,260
You can't sue a client in court

662
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:40,580
just because they fired you.

663
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:43,380
You don't need to suspect

664
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:44,940
if Cho Wai-yi wants to save Ma San-po.

665
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:47,700
It's about whether you want to save him

666
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:49,260
or if you still can

667
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:50,380
save him

668
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:51,700
as a lawyer.

669
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:53,660
As for other things,

670
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:55,660
I don't have an answer for you.

671
00:32:58,420 --> 00:32:59,420
Anything else I can do?

672
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:26,860
See you, Madam.

673
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:27,580
Bye-bye.

674
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:28,060
See you tomorrow.

675
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:29,220
Bye-bye.

676
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:31,780
What is it?

677
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:33,660
Nothing, you can go.

678
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:34,540
See you, Madam.

679
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:34,940
Bye-bye.

680
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:35,660
See you tomorrow. Bye-bye.

681
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:36,380
Bye-bye, Madam.

682
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:44,220
Chun Yat-wai?

683
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:45,660
You're drinking on campus?

684
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:46,340
Give it to me.

685
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:47,740
Leave me alone.

686
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:50,940
If the uni finds out, you'll be punished

687
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:51,900
and might get expelled.

688
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:52,900
Give it to me.

689
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:54,300
Leave me alone!

690
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:57,300
My mom is dead.

691
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:01,540
I know why she left.

692
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:04,340
Don't pity me.

693
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:09,500
Stop drinking. Give it to me.

694
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:22,540
Stop doing foolish things.

695
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:24,860
Has something happened at home?

696
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:29,660
Hey...

697
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:35,020
Whatever it is,

698
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:37,180
drinking won't solve it.

699
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:42,900
I know.

700
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:48,500
I know this whole thing won't be fixed.

701
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:53,820
Calm down.

702
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:56,260
Breathe with me.

703
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:04,620
You're back.

704
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:05,460
Hey,

705
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:07,180
it's perfect timing.

706
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:09,140
The late-night supper is just ready.

707
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:12,900
I strongly suspect

708
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:14,540
you put a tracker on my phone.

709
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:16,580
How did you come up at this exact time?

710
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:17,340
Hey,

711
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:18,780
I'm from intelligence.

712
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:20,700
This is the basics.

713
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:25,780
Ka left her scarf here.

714
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:27,260
She's coming back in a couple of days.

715
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:28,940
You need to give it back to her, right?

716
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:31,820
She's applied for a long time

717
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:33,620
to be transferred back
to Eastern District Hospital.

718
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:35,460
She called me this morning.

719
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:37,260
She should be home now.

720
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:41,580
So this bowl of noodles

721
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:42,860
won't keep you here,

722
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:43,460
right?

723
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:47,940
She's my only sister.

724
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:51,100
I thought you only liked
drinking coffee.

725
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:52,500
Turns out you also like getting jealous.

726
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:56,460
I thought you only cared about work.

727
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:58,660
Turns out you enjoy mocking me too.

728
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:01,460
Fine.

729
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:03,100
If the noodles can't keep you,

730
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:05,020
this

731
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:06,580
should be able to.

732
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:11,580
What's this?

733
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:14,020
Found at the accident scene of Hon Gong.

734
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:17,940
Who gave this to you?

735
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:20,020
It's got bloodstains on it.

736
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:21,340
Look into it.

737
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:22,020
You'll get clues.

738
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:23,580
Who gave this to you?

739
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:27,260
Are you eating these noodles or not?

740
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:28,540
I worked hard to cook it.

741
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:29,940
Don't waste it if you're not eating.

742
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:38,660
Anyway,

743
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:40,300
the one who gave me this

744
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:41,580
shares the same goal as you.

745
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:42,540
You both want to find the culprit.

746
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:44,300
There's absolutely no conspiracy

747
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:46,500
or conflict of interest, okay?

748
00:36:56,540 --> 00:36:57,220
Hello, Ka.

749
00:36:58,340 --> 00:36:59,220
Yes, sorry.

750
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:00,940
I have something important

751
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:02,020
to deal with tonight.

752
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:04,940
See you at home later.

753
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:07,780
Get up!

754
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:09,180
The car's here, Chun Yat-wai.

755
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:09,660
Get up.

756
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:12,100
Hello, Mr. Chun.

757
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:13,620
I'm Yu Yan, coach
of the uni basketball team.

758
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:14,860
I called you just now.

759
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:15,500
Hey.

760
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:16,940
Why are you so drunk?

761
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:18,620
It's nothing to do with the coach.

762
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:20,020
I wanted to drink.

763
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:21,100
Get in the car.

764
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:21,500
Come on.

765
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:24,620
Be careful.

766
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:30,860
Mr. Chun, please be aware

767
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:32,020
that he just had an asthma attack.

768
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:34,820
Okay, thanks.

769
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:48,900
You know full well you've got asthma.

770
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:50,300
So don't drink anymore.

771
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:51,380
It'll irritate your airways.

772
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:55,020
Yat-wai.

773
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:56,980
I'm listening.

774
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:00,940
After you drank,

775
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:03,020
did you say anything to the coach?

776
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:04,820
Like what?

777
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:07,380
Anything you shouldn't have said.

778
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:09,260
I didn't tell her anything.

779
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:10,180
Nothing at all.

780
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:14,780
Didn't you bring your asthma inhaler?

781
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:00,180
Mr. Chun,

782
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:01,780
someone discovered new evidence

783
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:02,940
at the accident scene.

784
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:03,900
It'll be sent for blood analysis

785
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:04,740
and DNA testing.

786
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:05,780
Once the results are in,

787
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:08,020
the real culprit who hit Hon Gong

788
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:08,860
will face justice.

789
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:25,860
Yat-wai,

790
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:28,220
no need to keep looking.

791
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:10,700
I know

792
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:12,140
