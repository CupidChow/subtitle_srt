1
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:03,330
Only one more month until his release?

2
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:04,850
His sentence was cut by four months?

3
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:05,770
Yes.

4
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:07,980
That's wonderful.

5
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:11,890
When Yat-wai gets out,

6
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:13,490
he's coming straight to my place.

7
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:15,300
I'll make sure he eats well.

8
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:16,620
He's skin and bones.

9
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,260
I doubt they serve
anything decent in there.

10
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:19,620
Youth is the time

11
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:21,530
to lay the foundation
for lifelong health.

12
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:23,300
Neglect it now, and regret may follow.

13
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:24,780
Let's talk about this later.

14
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:26,850
I'm serious.

15
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:29,940
After Yat-wai comes out,

16
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,050
I don't want him to live with you.

17
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:36,540
I think you've really changed a lot.

18
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:38,900
You weren't like this before.

19
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:40,820
I don't know what happened.

20
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:41,940
In the past six months,

21
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,620
those major cases you judged

22
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,260
were truly horrifying.

23
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:47,980
Look at Sek Chi-yeung's case.

24
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:50,300
Everyone could see

25
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,540
something was off with the witness.

26
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:53,900
But rather than question it,

27
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,260
you went straight to sentencing.

28
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:56,650
Although

29
00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:58,410
you overturned it later,

30
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:00,500
if you'd been clearer at the time,

31
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,300
would an apology have been necessary?

32
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,410
And the land deed case

33
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,410
has caused such a stir.

34
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,210
There was a hunger strike,

35
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:10,490
and someone even got stabbed.

36
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:11,930
Although

37
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:12,980
that land deed

38
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:14,660
might have been illegal,

39
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:16,570
what the law upholds

40
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,050
is not just the letter of the law.

41
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,570
Humanity and justice

42
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:21,260
must also exist.

43
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,100
Do you think we can rely on

44
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,260
humanity and justice

45
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:25,980
to file an appeal?

46
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:26,980
Of course we can.

47
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:29,290
Then I'll leave it to you.

48
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,020
Me?

00:02:56,630 --> 00:03:02,280
[Justice Is Mine]

50
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:05,380
[Episode 19]

51
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,020
The injured is now in the ICU.

52
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:11,220
The tetanus infection
has spread to his internal organs.

53
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:12,860
His condition is critical.

54
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:14,700
This is all the fault
of those shameless developers.

55
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:15,860
Who do they think they are,
blocking my path

56
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:16,780
and putting up fences like that?

57
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,180
That's not a reason for you
to hurt someone.

58
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:19,140
I didn't.

59
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:20,780
I just wanted to take down the fences.

60
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:22,620
You were holding a very sharp,

61
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:23,980
rusty weapon

62
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:25,420
that could have taken someone's life
at any moment.

63
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:27,020
Cheung-kwai gave it to me.

64
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:28,540
Is that so?

65
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:30,740
I just grabbed it

66
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:32,460
from his house.

67
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:33,260
Hey,

68
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:34,980
we were there to tear down fences,

69
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:36,020
not take lives.

70
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:37,660
This is resistance against power

71
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:38,460
and those shameless developers.

72
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:39,340
Shut up.

73
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:41,660
Drop the nonsense.

74
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:43,620
Chui Dai-ngau said

75
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:45,420
he was at the back,

76
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:47,380
got pushed forward suddenly,

77
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:48,860
and ended up hurting the guy
by accident.

78
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:51,020
There was so much chaos at the time.

79
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,820
I got pushed too, Madam.

80
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:54,980
In such chaos,

81
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:56,900
you could still tell which one

82
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:58,380
was sharp enough to hurt someone

83
00:03:58,940 --> 00:03:59,820
and

84
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,500
which wasn't?

85
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:12,260
Is that a new rule?

86
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:14,020
So now, even as the boss,

87
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:15,740
I don't get any private space?

88
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:25,820
Alright, I give up.

89
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:26,380
Go ahead.

90
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:29,340
What's left to say?

91
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:30,540
The real culprit

92
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:32,260
struts out of the station,

93
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:33,460
and this fool

94
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:35,060
takes the blame

95
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:36,820
and gets charged.

96
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:38,620
Chi Cheung-kwai was released?

97
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:39,540
Of course he was.

98
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:40,540
There wasn't enough evidence.

99
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:41,700
What else could we do,

100
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:42,460
keep him locked up?

101
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:44,300
No matter what,

102
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:45,740
the fact remains

103
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:47,020
that someone

104
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:48,300
was seriously injured.

105
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:50,020
As a police officer,

106
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:51,300
you must enforce the law.

107
00:04:58,140 --> 00:04:58,540
You...

108
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:05,540
Uncle,

109
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:07,220
I know how much you enjoy tea,

110
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:09,220
so I had someone

111
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:11,340
bring back a cake
of aged Pu'er tea just for you.

112
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,300
Take your time with the tea.

113
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:16,740
I think everyone's heard

114
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:18,740
Dai-ngau was arrested.

115
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:20,220
And Mr. Tsang

116
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:21,940
is in the hospital on a hunger strike.

117
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:24,580
So Uncle said...

118
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:25,700
Never mind.

119
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,420
I'll sell the land.

120
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:30,060
You sure?

121
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:30,940
Yes.

122
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:34,180
Seriously?

123
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:35,180
How can this be okay?

124
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,620
What else can he do?

125
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:40,740
It's the way things are going.

126
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:43,420
The redevelopment of the old town

127
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:46,500
could be a good thing down the line.

128
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:47,740
Cheung-wing,

129
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:49,500
you represent everyone to negotiate.

130
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:52,220
Most importantly, there must be
a like-for-like replacement.

131
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:53,700
No cutting corners

132
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:55,220
on compensation.

133
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,500
If this can be settled,

134
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:58,220
Cheung-wing,

135
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:00,180
you'll be the hero of the old town.

136
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:00,860
No.

137
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:01,940
Come on,

138
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:03,340
let me toast you

139
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:04,220
with tea.

140
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:04,740
Come on.

141
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:05,700
I don't deserve it.

142
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:06,220
Uncle,

143
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:07,820
this is what I should do.

144
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:09,220
Enjoy the tea.

145
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:09,540
Okay.

146
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:10,180
Uncle, have some tea.

147
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:10,700
Okay.

148
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:11,500
Everyone, help yourselves.

149
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:14,500
Cheung-wing,

150
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:15,780
you're something else

151
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:17,180
for making Dai-ngau

152
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:18,700
into a game-changer.

153
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:20,660
Cut it out.

154
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:21,980
You played your part too.

155
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:23,220
You'll get your share. Don't worry.

156
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:24,180
Of course.

157
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:25,620
I risked my life for this.

158
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:27,660
Then why are you still hanging around?

159
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:29,740
Go make sure everything's under control.

160
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:30,940
Understood.

161
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:32,940
Ow!

162
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:34,300
Cheung-wing.

163
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:37,220
Mr. Yuen,

164
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:38,900
do you need something from me?

165
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:41,300
Since you're close with the chairman,

166
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,460
could you ask him
about selling the house for me?

167
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:46,700
Selling the house?

168
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:48,020
Everyone's taking the deal,

169
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:48,900
and you going for it too?

170
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:50,380
Our house

171
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:52,460
was bought when Wai and Sa got married.

172
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:54,220
It was under her name.

173
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:56,060
With Wai gone

174
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:57,900
and Sa working far away

175
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:58,820
with the kids,

176
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:00,180
she can't get back here to sign.

177
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:02,060
We want to sell, but we're blocked.

178
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:04,100
That's simple.

179
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:06,460
Just write a letter of authorization.

180
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:08,100
Can that really work?

181
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:09,140
Of course it can.

182
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:11,100
Chi.

183
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:26,740
Come on, get in there.

184
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:27,580
Back to your room.

185
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:32,020
Are you really going to avoid me
like I'm the plague?

186
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:36,340
After I agreed to let you stay
with your kids,

187
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:36,980
the least you could do is say thanks

188
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:38,340
instead of walking around
looking so miserable.

189
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:41,500
Come here.

190
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:47,860
I told you to come here!

191
00:07:58,220 --> 00:07:58,860
Sign this.

192
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:00,500
What is it?

203

00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:50,860
and then developed by the developer.

381
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:53,180
We respect the law,

382
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:54,340
and at the same time,

383
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:56,500
we respect the historical significance
of the land

384
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:58,940
and indigenous residents
who have preserved its legacy

385
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:01,300
by living here for centuries.

386
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:01,940
Prosecution counsel,

387
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,100
can history put food on the table?

388
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:06,140
Moreover,

389
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:07,620
what's true doesn't change,

390
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:08,980
and what's false

391
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:10,020
can't be made true.

392
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:12,860
My land deed is real.

393
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:14,060
Your Honor,

394
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:15,740
it's as real as it gets!

395
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:17,740
Prosecution counsel,

396
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:19,500
remind your client

397
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:20,460
to remain calm.

398
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:21,820
Calm down.

399
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:24,860
The prosecution has raised concerns

400
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:26,820
regarding Identification Report No. 8

401
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:27,660
from the initial trial.

402
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:29,620
We respectfully request that the court

403
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:31,020
authorize a re-evaluation

404
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:32,260
of this critical piece of evidence.

405
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:33,300
Objection.

406
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:35,500
The identification was performed

407
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:36,300
using the most advanced tools available.

408
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:37,780
No matter how many times it's done,

409
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:38,860
the result

410
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:40,300
won't change.

411
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:41,300
The outcome

412
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:43,060
bears on public interest.

413
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:45,020
Denying a re-evaluation

414
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:46,460
would constitute
a breach of procedural justice.

415
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:47,940
This forms the basis

416
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:48,820
of my client's appeal.

417
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:49,660
Objection.

418
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:51,140
Further delay serves no purpose.

419
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:58,380
The Court finds
the prosecution's grounds

420
00:16:58,380 --> 00:16:59,660
for appeal to be valid.

421
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:01,020
This case

422
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,460
will be retried

423
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:03,340
in one week.

424
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:13,620
Congratulations

425
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:15,380
on successfully filing your appeal

426
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:16,140
in the land case.

427
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:18,740
I'm not good
at these kinds of cases at all.

428
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:20,260
Thank you for reminding me

429
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:22,060
that I could appeal
based on procedural justice.

430
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:25,140
As you gain more experience,

431
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:27,100
you'll find no case too challenging.

432
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:34,660
I still don't quite understand

433
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:36,660
why

434
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:38,300
you came to me.

435
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:40,140
I mean,

436
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:42,740
why did you ask me to do this?

437
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:46,340
Although I'm retired,

438
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:48,580
I am still a judge.

439
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:51,060
The commitment to justice

440
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:53,060
has always been part of who I am.

441
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:55,260
I just did

442
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:56,140
what I ought to do.

443
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:58,980
Not every judge is like you.

444
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:00,220
Mr. Chun,

445
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:02,020
for one, definitely isn't.

446
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:06,820
It's precisely because
he is the opponent.

447
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:08,300
You know,

448
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:09,980
many lawyers

449
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:11,380
wouldn't risk offending

450
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:12,620
a court president.

451
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:14,020
But you've got the guts.

452
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:16,060
That's why I came to you.

453
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:19,020
I'm happy to take part in cracking down

454
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:20,180
on shady ties between officials
and business interests.

455
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,460
Seems I choose the right person.

456
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:32,500
Hello?

457
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:33,380
Chun Yue.

458
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:34,700
Help me.

459
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:36,180
Mrs. Cho?

460
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:38,060
Hello?

461
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:49,580
All set.

462
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:50,340
Get them sorted.

463
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:55,420
Do you have Sa's phone number?

464
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:56,780
Sa

465
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:59,260
only calls once a month.

466
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,260
She said where she's working now

467
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:02,340
is very inconvenient.

468
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:03,380
So,

469
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:05,060
none of us has her phone number.

470
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:05,820
Yes.

471
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:07,100
Our house

472
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:08,380
is under Sa's name.

473
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:10,660
An authorization letter is needed
if we want to sell it,

474
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:12,940
so we had to turn to
Chi Cheung-wing for help.

475
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:17,900
Keep an eye on what's going on
in the old town,

476
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:19,620
especially that lawyer.

477
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:21,620
Whatever she does is useless.

478
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:23,780
Isn't the real land deed with you?

479
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:26,460
A rare visitor.

480
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:28,620
Mr. Chun,

481
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:29,260
have a seat.

482
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:29,900
Okay.

483
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:32,460
I reached out plenty of times,

484
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:33,540
but you kept saying you were busy.

485
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:36,260
I really was tied up
with the land deed case.

486
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:37,780
But it's all sorted now.

487
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:38,660
Welcome.

488
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:39,540
Waiter,

489
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:40,380
add an extra set
of chopsticks and a bowl.

490
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:43,580
Go ahead, you guys.

491
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:44,100
I'll join you later.

492
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:44,500
Alright.

493
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:50,100
I never thought I'd be so honored

494
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:53,260
to share a meal
with the president of the court.

495
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:56,260
You're always like this.

496
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:57,340
It's getting boring.

497
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,900
Now I'm offering you a generous gift.

498
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,580
Consider it compensation

499
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:02,820
for the shot I fired at you.

500
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:06,540
Trying to make peace?

501
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:08,860
Before he died, Cho Wai-yi had
an insurance policy

502
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:10,260
that I arranged for him,

503
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:11,500
worth roughly

504
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:12,740
over two million.

505
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:15,700
Are you kidding?

506
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:18,580
Are we going to dig up his body

507
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:20,020
to get a death certificate?

508
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:21,380
Me being the notary is enough.

509
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:25,860
But his widow must sign it herself,

510
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:27,540
because she is the sole beneficiary.

511
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:31,900
Sa has to sign it herself?

512
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:36,300
I haven't seen her in a long time.

513
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:37,380
I don't know where she's gone.

514
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:40,420
When her dad sold the house,

515
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:41,500
didn't you give
the letter of authorization

516
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:43,060
to him yourself?

517
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:49,380
You're quite well-informed, aren't you?

518
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:52,260
I did nothing.

519
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:53,900
All I wish for

520
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:55,700
is to see my son walk free,

521
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:57,860
and finally live a simple life with him.

522
00:20:58,540 --> 00:20:59,500
I don't want to talk

523
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:01,260
about the past anymore.

524
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:02,580
Is that so?

525
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:08,100
Two million.

526
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,380
If I leave it,
the insurance company benefits.

527
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:14,340
Can you help me save someone?

528
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:15,900
What do you mean?

529
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:18,660
Check this number.

530
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:19,860
Where was it called from

531
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:20,780
yesterday?

532
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:22,860
Only the police have the authority

533
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:24,980
to obtain data
from the telecoms company.

534
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:27,100
Who do you want to save?

535
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:29,380
Cho Wai-yi's wife and children.

536
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:34,460
Over two million?

537
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:36,140
You actually believe that?

538
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:37,140
Don't you?

539
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:39,060
Seriously?

540
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:40,660
Do I look like an idiot?

541
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:42,780
It's like he wants me dead all the time.

542
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:44,540
That's true.

543
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:45,860
However,

544
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:49,340
he did say something right.

545
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:51,860
Once the land deed case is done,

546
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:53,660
it's payback time

547
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:55,780
for all those old scores.

548
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:59,140
It's not every day
he walks right into our hands.

549
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:05,700
Based on telecoms records,

550
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:07,220
the number was called

551
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:07,980
from Pak Nai Island.

552
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:10,540
If this is Chi Cheung-wing's hideout,

553
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:11,780
we might find

554
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:13,260
something unexpected there, Madam.

555
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,740
It's Chi Cheung-wing's drug warehouse.

556
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:19,740
Remember our first lesson

557
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:20,820
in police college?

558
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:21,940
What did it teach us?

559
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:23,900
Is catching criminals more important,

560
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:25,380
or saving lives?

561
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:27,060
Saving lives, obviously.

562
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:29,060
But the real issue is,

563
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:30,460
can you trust Chun Yue?

564
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:31,900
Not completely.

565
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:34,140
I went to Yuen Sa's house too.

566
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:35,940
Something felt off.

567
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:38,180
So I asked someone else

568
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:39,980
from the old town.

569
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:43,140
Chi Cheung-wing
was just a small-timer back then.

570
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:45,620
He and Cho Wai-yi both pursued Yuen Sa.

571
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:47,620
But she chose

572
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:48,980
Cho Wai-yi, who was a police officer.

573
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:50,260
Chi Cheung-wing lost face.

574
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:51,420
Of course he got mad.

575
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:53,180
The old town has no secrets.

576
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:54,460
Everyone knows about that.

577
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:58,860
What I find most strange

578
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:00,740
is Cho Wai-yi's death.

579
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:02,700
No one knows exactly
what happened to him.

580
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:04,060
All they know is, he got hurt

581
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:06,460
but didn't dare go to the hospital.

582
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:08,180
And the day he was injured,

583
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,420
a batch of firearms
just happened to go missing.

584
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:11,700
And the very next day,

585
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:13,300
Chi Cheung-wing nearly died

586
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:14,860
from an explosion
tied to those stolen firearms.

587
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:17,780
All signs indicate

588
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:19,700
Yuen Sa is currently facing

589
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:20,940
extreme danger.

590
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:22,780
In this operation, the rule is

591
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:23,860
to rescue the people first,

592
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:24,860
and only then pursue the criminals.

593
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:25,940
- Yes, Madam.
- Yes, Madam.

594
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:36,860
This is

595
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:38,660
Cho Wai-yi's death certificate.

596
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:40,860
Set up a time,

597
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:41,940
and my colleague will pose

598
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:43,820
as an insurance company employee.

599
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:46,380
This operation will be dangerous.

600
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:47,860
Since you are not a police officer,

601
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:49,100
you're not meant to be part of this.

602
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:51,860
If I don't show up,

603
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:53,660
I'm afraid Chi Cheung-wing
will get suspicious.

604
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:55,820
If you try to force your way in,

605
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:57,820
I'm afraid Yuen Sa and her children

606
00:23:57,820 --> 00:23:58,460
will be in danger.

607
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:01,020
I really want to know why

608
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:02,020
you're willing to risk your life

609
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:03,260
to save them?

610
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:05,300
Yes.

611
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:06,980
I owe them.

612
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:10,060
Do you accept my analysis?

613
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:12,140
I trust you will protect me.

614
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:16,460
Our people

615
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:17,580
will be on standby on the island.

616
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:18,820
Be careful.

617
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:21,980
Okay.

618
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:48,660
- Kwai.
- Kwai.

619
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:54,740
Cheung-wing.

620
00:24:58,260 --> 00:24:59,300
Welcome.

621
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:00,300
Take a seat, wherever you like.

622
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:05,700
Long time no see.

623
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:06,900
How are the children doing?

624
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:08,660
They're in the room, getting some rest.

625
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:09,580
Is that so?

626
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:14,020
Let's talk business.

627
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:17,100
This is the representative
from the insurance company,

628
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:17,900
Miss Tam.

629
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:19,460
I'm sorry

630
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:20,940
to make you come all this way.

631
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:22,260
It's no trouble.

632
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:23,860
We meet clients like this all the time.

633
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:25,100
Ms. Yuen,

634
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:26,420
I'll need your ID card

635
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:28,100
and the insured's death certificate.

636
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:29,260
Here.

637
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:36,780
The death certificate.

638
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:41,420
Teams A and B, stand by

639
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:42,460
for my command.

640
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:52,420
All necessary documents are here.

641
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:54,340
Please sign here, Ms. Yuen.

642
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:02,780
By the way,

643
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:04,900
when can the money come through
at the earliest?

644
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:06,860
Once the procedures are completed.

645
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:07,700
It won't take long.

646
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:08,700
Okay.

647
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:09,820
I'll see you out.

648
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:15,740
Don't go.

649
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:18,420
Your children are in the room.

650
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:22,420
I need to see Mr. Chun out.

651
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:23,900
Oh, him?

652
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:26,740
He's not leaving.

653
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:29,260
Instead, he's staying to chat

654
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:30,540
and catch up on old times.

655
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:35,140
Miss Tam,

656
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:36,700
your bag seems heavy.

657
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:37,300
Let me help you.

658
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:37,860
No need.

659
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:39,540
Team B, move in.

660
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:51,940
Both kids are rescued.

661
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:53,340
Received.

662
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:54,380
Come on,

663
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:55,180
let me help you with it.

664
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:55,860
No need.

665
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:59,020
Cheung-wing, there are police!

666
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:00,180
Move.

667
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:03,660
- Stay where you are!
- Freeze!

668
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:04,660
You dare try to harm me?

669
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:08,220
Hands up!

670
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:08,940
Freeze!

671
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:09,780
Stay where you are!

672
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:13,660
No!

673
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:42,780
Mr. Chun.

674
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:44,300
Mr. Chun.

675
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:48,500
Call an ambulance.

676
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:52,300
Madam,

677
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:54,540
it really is his drug hideout.

678
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:55,660
I will follow up on this.

679
00:27:58,420 --> 00:27:58,860
Madam,

680
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:00,700
Chi Cheung-wing's dead.

681
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:01,740
Mr. Chun is safe.

682
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:05,460
Slow down.

683
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:06,860
Grandpa, Grandma!

684
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:07,500
Dad, Mom!

685
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:08,460
- You're back.
- Welcome back.

686
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:09,260
My dear grandchildren.

687
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:10,780
Dad, Mom.

688
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:12,580
Thank goodness you're okay.

689
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:14,220
Grandma.

690
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:15,140
Let me take a look.

691
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:17,180
You can't stay here anymore.

692
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:18,620
Once you've packed your things,

693
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:19,780
my colleagues will escort you

694
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:20,980
to somewhere safe.

695
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:22,860
Let's wait for things to settle,

696
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:24,380
then we'll make a plan.

697
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:25,820
Thank you.

698
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:28,260
You should thank Mr. Chun.

699
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:34,780
Between the two of us,

700
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:35,860
gratitude isn't part of the equation.

701
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:40,820
Get some good rest.

702
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:42,700
Tomorrow, we'll need you
to come to the police station

703
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:43,460
to give a statement.

704
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:47,740
Thank you.

705
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:00,420
[Eastern District Police Station]

706
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:01,380
At the time,

707
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:02,260
everything was urgent and chaotic.

708
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:03,900
Chi Cheung-wing seemed

709
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:05,740
completely out of control,
trying to kill us.

710
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:08,660
Mr. Chun

711
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:10,660
lunged at him to stop him.

712
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:12,420
You dare try to harm me?

713
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:17,220
Then there was a gunshot.

714
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:19,900
They both hit the ground.

715
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:24,380
Then, there was movement.

716
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:27,500
Chi Cheung-wing

717
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:28,540
got back up.

718
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:30,740
Even though I was wearing
a bulletproof vest,

719
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:32,940
I blacked out

720
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:33,620
the moment I got shot.

721
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:36,780
No!

722
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:54,660
I knew he would kill us.

723
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:55,220
So,

724
00:29:57,180 --> 00:29:59,340
I picked up his gun
and pointed it at him.

725
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:04,660
I don't know

726
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:05,620
what happened after that.

727
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:10,980
Don't be reckless.

728
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:12,860
Think about your parents
and your children.

729
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:36,540
I killed him.

730
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:43,260
One more shot.

731
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:44,460
Aim it at me.

732
00:30:58,500 --> 00:30:59,860
What does the autopsy report say?

733
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:01,820
Shot in the carotid artery in the neck.

734
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:03,180
It's one of the fatal wounds.

735
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:05,740
Plus a severe head injury
at the back of the head.

736
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:07,180
But the two injuries

737
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:08,340
happened too close together.

738
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:10,020
The forensic pathologist
couldn't determine

739
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:11,620
the sequence of events.

740
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:18,540
If the head injury came first,

741
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:20,540
then perhaps Chi Cheung-wing

742
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:21,900
was already incapacitated at that time.

743
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:24,180
And then a shot to his neck

744
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,340
would not be self-defense,

745
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:27,660
but murder.

746
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:34,300
Chun Yue was the only witness,

747
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:35,980
but he says he blacked out

748
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:37,060
and didn't see a thing.

749
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:42,820
If he withholds information,

750
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,060
it's obstruction of justice.

751
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:46,820
Are you sure?

752
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:50,180
No.

753
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:52,660
A widow and her children

754
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:54,460
were held captive for over half a year,

755
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:57,260
always living in fear.

756
00:31:58,060 --> 00:31:59,340
Now even the forensic pathologist

757

00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:04,060
Isn't this a good outcome?

What's next for you?

760
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:27,420
I want nothing more

761

I'm sorry.

From today onwards,

764
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:40,420
we go our separate ways.

765
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:45,620
I just want to live my life in peace.

766
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:49,740
As long as you need me,

767
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:53,020

when do we make our move?

788
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:10,380
He still doesn't know

789
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:11,300
what his son has turned into.

790
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:16,740
Give him some time.

791
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:18,940
No rush.

792
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:45,660
You've dropped a lot of weight.

793
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:47,740
You should eat more.

794
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:49,580
I made some soup.

795
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:51,180
I'll cook something for you soon.

796
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:52,500
I'm a little tired.

797
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:53,780
I need to take a short rest.

798
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:07,900
He seems different.

with the land deed case.

804
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:16,220
It's been overwhelming.

If you get the chance,

806
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:18,300

[Hokong Judiciary]

809
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:50,100
What we need to discuss today

810
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:51,420
is recusal

811

and the list of witnesses to appear,

812
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:54,660
as well as the exclusion
of false evidence.

813
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:56,380
Now that both the prosecution
and defense are present,

814
00:36:57,060 --> 00:36:57,820
we may proceed.

an internationally recognized authority
on cultural relics

818
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:05,100
to conduct a re-evaluation
of the land deed.

819

We request

820
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:08,420
that proceedings be postponed

821
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:09,420
until the findings are submitted.

How many days will that take?

Approximately five days.

due to procedural justice.

Hey, you...

That's true.

This is a critical moment.

It's better to be cautious.

The most important thing

846
00:37:57,860 --> 00:37:58,980
is still that land deed.

00:42:20,860 --> 00:42:21,940
we won.

950
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:26,820
Ms. Chow, thank you.

951
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:28,860
Ms. Chow.

952
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:30,300
Thank you.

953
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:30,860
Congratulations.

954
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:32,460
Thank you, Ms. Chow.

955
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:33,180
You're welcome.

956
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:34,820
You saved the old town.

957
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:35,660
Indeed.

958
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:36,540
Congratulations.

959
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:37,620
Thank you.

960
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:43,060
- Thank you, Ms. Chow.
- Thank you, Ms. Chow.

961
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:47,300
What wrong with you?

962
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:49,300
Why did you overturn your own judgment?

963
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:50,260
How can I explain this to them?

964
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:53,420
The prosecution
presented strong evidence.

965
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:54,540
Plus, the case

966
00:42:54,580 --> 00:42:55,780
has such a huge social impact.

967
00:42:56,180 --> 00:42:57,620
I merely did

968
00:42:57,660 --> 00:42:58,620
what was right.

969
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:00,020
Don't forget

970
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:02,100
how you got the position.

971
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:03,740
I was appointed
by the executive authorities.

972
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:06,060
I advise you

973
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:08,140
to apply for an appeal
to the Court of Final Appeal.

974
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:10,580
You know better than I do

975
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:11,620
how long that process takes.

976
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:13,020
I can't afford to wait.

977
00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:14,180
The developers are pushing hard.

978
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:15,100
And those behind me

979
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:17,700
are even more desperate.

980
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:19,860
If something were to happen

981
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:21,780
to me at this critical moment,

982
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:24,140
it would definitely affect

983
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:25,340
the Court of Final Appeal's stance
on this case.

984
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:27,220
You can try.

985
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:42,220
Ms. Sum,

986
00:43:42,580 --> 00:43:43,220
thank you.

987
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:45,660
This case taught me a lot.

988
00:43:46,220 --> 00:43:47,620
It also helped me regain my confidence.

989
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:49,820
That's great.

990
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:52,300
But my master...

991
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:55,220
no, Mr. Chun,

992
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:56,500
really has nothing to do with this?

993
00:43:58,020 --> 00:43:59,180
Why did you ask that?

994
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:01,100
Isn't he the one who's best

995
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:02,900
at manipulating those around him,

996
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:04,580
using whatever means necessary

997
00:44:04,620 --> 00:44:05,540
to get what he wants?

998
00:44:08,260 --> 00:44:09,260
You're overthinking it.

999
00:44:11,180 --> 00:44:12,180
Maybe.

1000
00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:18,140
No need to see me out.

1001
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:19,540
Take care.

1002
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:21,260
Thank you.

1003
00:44:44,540 --> 00:44:45,660
Now that you're here,

1004
00:44:46,140 --> 00:44:48,260
I know she really hoped
to see you again.

1005
00:44:49,660 --> 00:44:50,700
It's better this way.

1006
00:44:51,620 --> 00:44:53,380
She has no idea
the land deed was switched.

1007
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:54,420
All she knows

1008
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:55,940
is that she won the case.

1009
00:44:58,100 --> 00:44:59,420
Her regaining confidence

1010
00:45:00,140 --> 00:45:01,460
is what I most wanted to see.

1011
00:45:03,620 --> 00:45:04,820
As her master,

1012
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:07,220
consider it the best gift you gave her.

1013
00:45:27,820 --> 00:45:28,260
Mr. Hon Lit,

1014
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:29,660
we've got them.

1015
00:45:30,220 --> 00:45:30,780
What should we do with them?

1016
00:45:44,060 --> 00:45:44,460
Hello?

1017
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:45,420
Chun Yue,

1018
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:47,380
is Yat-wai with you?

1019
00:45:48,060 --> 00:45:50,220
He said he'd come to my place
for dinner tonight,

1020
00:45:50,220 --> 00:45:51,700
but he hasn't shown up yet

1021
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:52,900
and he's not answering his phone.

1022
00:45:54,940 --> 00:45:55,380
Hey.

1023
00:45:55,660 --> 00:45:57,380
You know I can't stand

1024
00:45:57,420 --> 00:45:58,820
the stench of cat droppings.

1025
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:00,820
This coffee isn't about taste.

1026
00:46:01,420 --> 00:46:02,060
It's about what it represents.

1027
00:46:03,940 --> 00:46:04,740
This coffee

1028
00:46:04,940 --> 00:46:06,540
is Chun Yue's alibi.

1029
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:09,100
I finally found his flaw.

1030
00:46:10,180 --> 00:46:11,020
You traitor!

1031
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:12,620
You turned on us!

1032
00:46:22,540 --> 00:46:22,980
Mr. Hon Lit,

1033
00:46:23,900 --> 00:46:25,140
he's stood with me for years.

1034
00:46:25,260 --> 00:46:26,260
Please spare his life.

1035
00:46:28,100 --> 00:46:29,100
Then who will pay

1036
00:46:30,140 --> 00:46:30,980
for my dad's life?

1037
00:46:33,820 --> 00:46:34,460
Mr. Hon Lit.

1038
00:46:34,620 --> 00:46:35,500
No!

1039
00:46:46,620 --> 00:46:48,060
I want their bodies back.

1040
00:46:49,180 --> 00:46:50,140
Feed them to the dogs.

1041
00:47:00,220 --> 00:47:00,700
Yat-wai.

1042
00:47:04,060 --> 00:47:04,540
Yat-wai.

1043
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:39,420
I'm sorry.

1044
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:40,860
I didn't want to.

1045
00:47:42,620 --> 00:47:44,020
Hon Lit and his men forced me.

1046
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:49,100
How long has it been going on?

1047
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:50,460
Half a year.

1048
00:47:54,620 --> 00:47:55,420
Don't be afraid.

1049
00:47:56,500 --> 00:47:57,940
I'll go with you to see the doctor.

1050
00:47:58,300 --> 00:47:59,180
Just hang in there.

1051
00:47:59,260 --> 00:48:00,060
With the right medication,

1052
00:48:00,260 --> 00:48:01,420
you'll feel better soon.

1053
00:48:02,100 --> 00:48:02,780
Don't be afraid.

1054
00:48:04,140 --> 00:48:05,340
Come on, get into bed and get some rest.

1055
00:48:20,740 --> 00:48:21,380
Don't be afraid.

1056
00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:22,820
I'm here with you.
