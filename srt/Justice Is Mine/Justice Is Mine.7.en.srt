Sir, please turn on the radio.

After the financial news
comes the local news.

00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:26,420
A shooting incident

6
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:28,340
happened early this morning
in the old town.

it's connected
to an earlier traffic accident.

The deceased

10
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:34,580
is said to be
an 18-year-old surnamed Ma.

11
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:35,780
According to witnesses,

12
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:38,300
several gangsters drove
a champagne-colored car

13
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:39,500
and parked it in front of Ma's house.

14
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:40,300
Later,

15
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:41,420
two of the gangsters

16
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:42,620
- fired several shots,
- Please pull over.

leading to Ma's death from his injuries.

18
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:46,020
Police are now working fully
to track down the suspects.

19
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:59,220
Who told you to do that?

20
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,700
We got a tip-off call
at midnight yesterday.

21
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:05,100
They gave a name and location this time.

22
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:06,340
Are you sure

23
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:08,500
it wasn't that lunatic, Chi Cheung-wing,

24
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,380
using someone else's hand
to silence him?

25
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:12,260
The one who died was from the old town.

That's not a loss for me.

29
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:18,100
Who did it?

30
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:20,980
It was for my brother.

31
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:23,260
I must take care of it myself.

32
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,260
The cops will come after you.

33
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,300
Let them.

34
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:30,460
I've sorted it all out.

35
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:31,500
I have nothing to fear.

36
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:35,740
Do you even realize
the trouble you've caused?

37
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:39,300
You killed that punk,

38
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:41,260
and you think you're tough.

39
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,220
If it were your brother,

40
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:45,780
he'd have wiped out the whole old town,

41
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:47,180
leaving no one alive.

Did I make a mistake?

56
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:29,260
I shouldn't have let him out at all.

57
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:32,180
Remember what I said?

58

Getting intel

59
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,900
has to be unexpected.

60

It's all strategy.

61
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:41,180
You followed the procedure
without breaching any rules, right?

62
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:43,020
Besides,

00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:50,520
would still kill him.

68
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:53,240
But the issue is no one should've known

69

Did he say anything to you?

91
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:50,700
He only told me

you're taking him abroad.

Explain everything first.

98
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:00,180
Why did you tell me

99
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:01,700
not to let Yat-wai go out last night?

100
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:05,100
Because...

101
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:08,620
he was emotionally unstable
last evening.

102
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:10,780
We argued a little.

103
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:12,580
Yat-wai is still young.

104
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:14,340
Why are you suddenly taking him away?

105
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:18,100
I have my reasons.

106
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:20,140
Then explain them clearly.

107
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:21,420
What happened?

108
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:23,340
Are you hiding something from me?

109
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:25,460
Yesterday,

110
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:27,100
I went to the bank

111
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,580
to deposit some money for Yat-wai.

112
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:29,940
I checked the balance

113
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:31,620
and got shocked.

114
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:34,380
Turns out you withdrew all the money.

115
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:36,100
What is going on?

116
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:41,580
Can I have some water?

117
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:02,980
Thanks.

118
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:05,860
Go ahead.

119
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:11,140
Not long ago,

120
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,540
I found Yat-wai in a relationship
with his teacher.

121
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:16,260
She

122
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,140
is the coach
of the uni basketball team.

123
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:19,700
She's a few years older.

124
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,900
I can't believe this.

125
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:24,700
They were drinking on campus,

126
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:26,420
and it alarmed the university.

127
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:28,940
I attended the disciplinary meeting

128
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,820
as his parent.

129
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:32,460
With a female coach?

130
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:35,900
Maybe he missed his mother so much

131
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:37,900
after Lam died

132
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:39,740
that he wanted someone to confide in

133
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:40,820
and let his feelings out.

134
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:56,140
Actually,

135
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:58,380
I also wanted to take Yat-wai to Canada

136
00:10:58,380 --> 00:10:59,100
to study for a semester.

137
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:02,700
So I withdrew all the money.

138
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:04,500
Are you really willing to go with him?

139
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:06,260
You'd quit your job

140
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:07,660
as a judge?

141
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:09,380
I will.

142
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:16,340
If you had thought this way,

143
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:18,100
my daughter

144
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:19,820
wouldn't have committed suicide.

145
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:23,100
You still owe me an answer about this.

146
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:24,540
I don't have an answer.

147
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:25,740
I don't know why either.

148
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:28,660
I only know I must treat Yat-wai better

149
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:30,860
after Lam died.

150
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,180
What kind of coach is that?

151
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,700
How can she even be called a teacher?

152
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:41,660
She completely disregards ethics.

153
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:43,540
I'm going to report her to the uni.

154
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:44,620
No need.

155
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:45,780
I've taken care of it.

156
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:47,940
Your solution is to pull Yat-wai

157
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:49,060
away from the environment and friends

158
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:50,220
he's familiar with.

159
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:51,020
Okay.

160
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:52,380
We can discuss

161
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:53,940
whether we are leaving.

162
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:56,700
Talk it over properly with him.

163
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:58,460
Stop agitating him.

164
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:00,340
Okay, I will.

165
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:27,980
Let's go.

166
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:29,980
Where to?

167
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:31,700
Home.

168
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:33,260
Let's go.

169
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:38,700
Daddy.

170
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,620
Can you tell me what happened?

171
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:46,900
Let's talk at home.

172
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:57,000
Okay.

173
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:58,260
Got it.

174
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:01,700
No worries, I'll pass it on.

175
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:03,980
Alright, bye.

176
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:07,460
Excuse me,

177
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:10,060
how long do I need to wait
to see Ms. Tong?

178
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:11,660
She's unavailable.

179
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:13,620
Do you need me to book a time for you?

180
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:14,860
That won't be necessary.

181
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:16,260
I'll wait for her.

182
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:24,140
We're back home.

183
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:25,100
Can you

184
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:25,940
tell me now?

185
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:31,820
Have you heard of cautioned statements?

186
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:36,900
When you're not just a witness,

187
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,420
but also a suspect,

188
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:40,900
once cautioned by the police,

189
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:42,460
whatever you say

190
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:44,660
may be used as evidence in court.

191
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:48,820
I was worried I'd slip up

192
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:50,380
and they'd catch on.

193
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:52,340
And did they notice?

194
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:56,660
I only confirmed this morning

195
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:59,260
that they didn't discover anything.

196
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:03,340
I panicked last night

197
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:04,860
and lost my footing.

198
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:09,260
I was terrified that if I were arrested,

199
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:11,500
you'd be on your own,

200
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:13,580
and eventually

201
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:15,980
even you might be caught.

202
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:20,260
I was too scared to think further,

203
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:22,140
so I wanted to run away.

204
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:24,300
But it's all fine now.

205
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:26,220
Are you sure?

206
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:30,340
Yes.

207
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:35,380
Sorry.

208
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:01,530
You have a message.

209
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:03,340
To listen to it, press 1.

210
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:05,420
Mr. Chun,

211
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:07,660
Po won't say anything.

212
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:09,300
Rest assured, everything's over now.

213
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:29,820
Dad,

214
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:31,460
shall we order takeaway this afternoon?

215
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:33,820
Okay.

216
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:34,980
You order it.

217
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:06,500
Madam Tong.

218
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:11,020
Carry on with this.

219
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:14,180
What is it, Ms. Chow?

220
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:15,740
Ma San-po was shot dead

221
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:17,140
while under police protection.

222
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:18,980
There's clearly a mole in your force.

223
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:20,780
I demand that the police

224
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:22,740
give an immediate explanation
for his death.

225
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:24,460
The case is still under investigation.

226
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:28,700
You knew full well
he wasn't the real culprit.

227
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:30,940
He had an alibi.

228
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:33,460
He was pushed out as a scapegoat.

229
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:36,420
The police must act on evidence.

230
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:37,620
But gangs kill without restraint,

231
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:39,340
even when they aren't sure
of their target.

232
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:40,660
Tsui Hung being doused in hot oil

233
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:41,900
proves it.

234
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:43,620
What's your point?

235
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:44,340
My point is,

236
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:46,060
once Ma San-po got bailed,

237
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:47,300
he was sure to face danger

238
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,780
and get dragged into the gang feud.

239
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:50,780
Why did you insist on bailing him out?

240
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:51,820
Because I thought

241
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:52,900
you could protect him.

242
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:54,460
Other than the prosecutor and me,

243
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:55,620
you also knew

244
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:56,740
he was going home.

245
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:58,140
When you openly drove

246
00:16:58,140 --> 00:16:59,220
into the old town,

247
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:00,660
did you ever think of that?

248
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:03,900
Offering information

249
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:05,940
to trade for immigration?

250
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:08,180
Was it genuine intel,

251
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:10,020
or were you playing legal tricks?

252
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:13,380
Only veterans use that kind of trick.

253
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,900
It's not something
a rookie like you could think up.

254
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:18,100
Who taught you?

255
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:34,900
Wai,

256
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:36,460
how long have we been together?

257
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:38,620
The kids are asleep.

258
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:39,540
Don't wake them.

259
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,780
I don't care if you're still a cop

260
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:43,460
or if you earn less than before.

261
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:45,540
When we married,

262
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:47,020
I swore I'd stand by you

263
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:48,220
no matter what,

264
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,420
as long as the family stays healthy.

265
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:51,820
But you?

266
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:54,580
Have you forgotten your vows?

267
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,620
I never thought it'd turn out like this.

268
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:59,380
If something had happened
to us yesterday,

269
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:00,740
what about the kids?

270
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:02,820
I didn't think it would be like this.

271
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:04,420
From the night Po came to our house

272
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:05,700
until he was taken,

273
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:07,260
it's been two weeks,

274
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,020
two whole weeks.

275
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:10,460
If you'd thought it through,

276
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:11,820
that means you don't care

277
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:13,020
about our family's lives at all.

278
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:16,340
Wai, I'm leaving here.

279
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:17,300
I'm leaving you.

280
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:18,940
Why?

281
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:20,020
I'm taking the kids with me.

282
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:20,460
Hey,

283
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:23,740
I just want a safe, peaceful life.

284
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:26,180
After Po's funeral,

285
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:27,180
I'll take the kids

286
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:28,340
and go to my parents' place.

287
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:29,740
Sa.

288
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:33,700
It's Mr. Chun, right?

289
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,050
Answer it.

290
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:36,580
Ask him

291
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:37,540
if he knows

292
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:38,700
he's torn our family apart.

293
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:39,660
Sa.

294
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:41,340
Don't be like this.

295
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:42,940
Just because he once helped you,

296
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:45,300
you'd willingly give up this family

297
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:46,500
and risk your life for him?

298
00:18:58,780 --> 00:18:59,460
Hello?

299
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:02,940
My phone ran out of battery.

300
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:05,500
I just heard your message.

301
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:07,180
Didn't you say everything was fine?

302
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:09,140
How did it end up like this?

303
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:10,780
You're asking me?
What am I supposed to know?

304
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:14,660
I'm sorry it turned out this way.

305
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:15,900
Does an apology work?

306
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:17,300
Will Po come back to life?

307
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:24,260
Look,

308
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:27,500
if Po's family needs anything,

309
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,380
let me know and I'll see if I can help.

310
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:30,700
I wouldn't dare trouble you.

311
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:32,780
I'm scared someone else might die.

312
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:33,940
Don't call me again.

313
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:52,100
Master.

314
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:54,860
What is it?

315
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:57,060
Did I get Ma San-po killed?

316
00:19:58,300 --> 00:19:59,620
I shouldn't have taken your advice

317
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:01,420
and bailed him out.

318
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:02,900
Then he wouldn't be dead.

319
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:06,420
Have you forgotten what I told you?

320
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:08,300
You're a lawyer, not a bodyguard.

321
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:11,580
He was only 18 years old.

322
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:14,940
If it were your son,

323
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:16,740
would you still say that?

324
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:23,860
Lawyers

325
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:26,100
must keep a distance from their clients

326
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:27,660
to stay professional.

327
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:30,700
Now the person's dead,

328
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,500
and the case

329
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:33,500
is closed too.

330
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:37,820
It's not closed.

331
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:41,700
Ma San-po wasn't just my client.

332
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:43,820
He was a living person.

333
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:51,700
I will clear his name.

334
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:24,440
Come here.

335
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:32,780
Let's go.

336
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:34,780
Come on, get in the car.

337
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:40,980
Chun,

338
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:43,140
listen to your mom.

339
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:45,340
Take good care
of your little sister, all right?

340
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:46,620
Good boy.

341
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:50,540
Chun.

342
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:54,580
Go.

343
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:00,180
Come on.

344
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:04,580
Start the car.

345
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,140
[Ong Siu, Legislative Council Member]
The shooting that took place today

346
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:48,940
may be another round of fighting

347
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:50,220
between two opposing gangs.

348
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:52,700
According to appointed
legislative councillor Ong Siu,

349
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:54,580
tensions between the old town gang

350
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:55,900
and the Hons gang

351
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:57,420
have intensified

352
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,140
following a hit-and-run case

353
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:00,060
two weeks earlier.

354
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,340
According to police information,

355
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:04,780
the victim of the shooting

356
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:06,580
was an 18-year-old young man
from the old town,

357
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:07,180
named Ma San-po.

358
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:08,460
And this shooting...

359
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:09,620
Did we get him killed?

360
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:14,340
Didn't you hear it?

361
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:18,060
It was an accident
that came out of a gang vendetta.

362
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:20,980
No one

363
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:22,940
could have stopped an accident.

364
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:29,300
It's over now.

365
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:31,940
Let's not talk about it anymore,

366
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:32,500
okay?

367
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,620
Let me have dinner with you tonight.

368
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:03,780
I'm on a vegetarian week.

369
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:06,220
It's fine.

370
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:09,020
Ying, get him a bowl and chopsticks.

371
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:09,780
Okay.

372
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:14,900
Mr. Hon Lit,

373
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:17,180
following Mr. Hon Fui-lung's custom,

374
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:18,500
we'll light memorial candles

375
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:19,820
and pray for the deceased.

376
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:22,220
Is that okay?

377
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:27,380
No wonder you came back
to have dinner with me.

378
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:29,180

Thank you.

Are you Ms. Yu?

570
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:27,820
Yes.

about you and Yat-wai.

Who told you that?

578

Ms. Yu,

579
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:49,660
Yat-wai

580
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:51,220
is only 19 years old.

581
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:53,500
Even though you're young,

582
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:54,900
you are still his teacher.

583
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:57,340
It seems very inappropriate

584
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:58,540
that a teacher

585
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:00,620
dates their student.

586
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:01,380
Wait a moment.

587
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:03,860
Nothing like that ever happened.

588
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:06,380
Yat-wai's father

589
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:08,620
said you drank with him on campus

590
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:10,300
and were warned
by the education committee.

591
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:11,460
He actually said that?

592
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:13,540
He knows what really happened.

593
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:14,620
Why would he say that?

594
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,130
You mean...

595
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:19,620
Chun Yat-wai

596
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:21,580
told me

597
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:24,180
that his mother took her own life.

598
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:27,540
I could see his suffering.

599
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:28,900
He couldn't figure a lot of things out.

600
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:30,780
So I reached out to support him.

601
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:34,140
I'm not sure if that's why

602
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:36,780
he transferred the attachment
he had to his mother

603
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,020
onto me.

604
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:41,340
As adults, we know such behavior

605
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:42,820
stems from loneliness.

606
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:45,260
He needed someone to talk to.

607
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:46,420
And I just happened to be

608
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:47,620
the person who could listen.

609
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:48,980
Is that a fault?

610
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:52,840
Sorry,

611
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:54,620
I tend to speak bluntly.

612
00:35:58,820 --> 00:35:59,700
Sorry.

613
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:01,060
Thanks for your time.

614
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:02,940
Wait.

615
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:04,420
There's one more thing.

616
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:15,580
Chun Yat-wai gave me this necklace.

617
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:16,940
I turned it down.

618
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:18,300
But he forced it on me anyway.

619

Chun Yat-wai and I

00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:23,980
have never been in a relationship.

Even if his father is a judge,

622
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,020
he shouldn't just throw
false accusations

The victim of this shooting

was Ma San-po, aged 18 years old.

639
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:17,780
He came from a single-parent family
in the old town.

His father had also been a member
of the old town gang

and died in a gang vendetta years ago.

642

have not found the killer.

732
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:15,220
She would never have taken her own life.

733
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:17,020
She didn't even leave a suicide note.

734
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:18,700
There was simply no reason at all.

735
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:20,700

Chun Yue was my intern.

737

once Yat-wai was born,

744
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:53,860

00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:13,300

Such things happen often.

756
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:18,380
And you're a police officer.

757
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:19,820
You ought to investigate.

758
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:21,220
How do you know I'm not?

759
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:22,420
Do you know Yat-wai?

760
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:25,300

762
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:27,500
Ms. Sum,

763
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:29,180
this isn't a courtroom.

764
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:44,460
In court,

765
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:47,500
I could order you to answer me.

766
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:51,820
But this,

767
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:53,980
this is my request.

768
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:57,140
I'm no longer a judge
sitting high above.

00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:38,700
The police found an asthma inhaler

778
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:40,460
at the car accident scene.

779
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:46,420
The DNA on the inhaler

matches the other findings.

781
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:49,980
What findings?

I'm not sure.

00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:52,940
It wasn't written there.

784
00:43:53,580 --> 00:43:54,540
But what matters is

785
00:43:54,780 --> 00:43:56,420
that the inhaler and other findings

786
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:57,940
do not match

787

Ma San-po's DNA.

This accident has nothing
to do with Ma San-po.

00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:03,620
Tong Huen knew about this long ago.

790

So did Mr. Cheung.

791

noticed this file

was originally with Tong Huen

797

and later with Mr. Cheung.

798
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:20,180
So I thought

Not like that.

The victim of this shooting

809
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:01,780
was Ma San-po, aged 18 years old.

810
00:45:02,220 --> 00:45:04,540
He came from a single-parent family
in the old town.

His father had also been a member
of the old town gang

It's me who got him killed.

First of all,

819
00:45:42,060 --> 00:45:42,860
Ma San-po requested

820
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:45,100
that he turn state's evidence.

821
00:45:47,580 --> 00:45:48,600

that he'd give information,

823
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:52,780

he died under house arrest
as you had requested.

the police can claim
no responsibility at all.
