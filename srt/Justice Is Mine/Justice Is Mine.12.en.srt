solitary confinement

and blocking the news

5
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:07,570
is necessary to guarantee

the safety of Chun Yat-wai.

00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:11,650
This is only a temporary solution.

Once the case goes to court,

9
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:15,170
it will go public,

10
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:16,490
and

11
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:18,850
Hon Fui-lung will find out

12
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:20,300
that Chun Yat-wai was the one

13
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,460
who almost killed his son.

14
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:24,620
I suggest that from now on,

15
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:26,050
everyone should be back on duty.

16
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:27,140

00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:57,420
[Hokong Maximum Security Prison]
The one who hit Gong is caught.

196
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,580
His name is Chun Yat-wai,

197
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:01,100
a judge's son.

198
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:02,340
But

199
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:04,180
the police blocked the news.

200
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:06,100
We don't know where he is held.

201
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:08,100
The detention room
of Eastern District Police Station.

202
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:12,500
Dad, you are behind bars,

203
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,620
but you know everything.

204
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:16,540
As long as there are people

205
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:18,820
and money,

206
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:21,300
you can know everything.

207
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:25,900
After he is sentenced,

208
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:29,220
I will make sure
he won't be out of the jail alive.

209
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:31,940
Only I can try the guy

210
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:34,260
who harmed my son,

211
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:37,500
and I will sentence him to death.

212
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:41,220
Got it.

213
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:43,460
I will arrange it.

214
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:50,380
How is your brother doing?

215
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:54,380
He is fine.

216
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:58,340
Yesterday, he asked me

217
00:13:58,700 --> 00:13:59,980
if I could get him two ladies.

218
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:05,420
I think he will be fine soon.

219
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:11,620
Lit,

220
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:14,060
you can do it.

221
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:16,620
The Hon family

222
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:19,420
is all on you two in the future.

223
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:24,100
I got it, Dad.

224
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:28,060
Go.

225
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:30,060
Get down.

226
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:31,100
Get down. Stay still.

227
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:32,780
Take them over.

228
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:33,620
They are all gangsters.

229
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:34,140
Okay.

230
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:35,500
Sit well.

231
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,220
What's that attitude?

232
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:37,820
Mind your manners.

233
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:38,500
Sit.

234
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:39,580
Who's your boss?

235
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:40,780
It's none of your business.

236
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:41,980
What's going on here?

237
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:43,340
What are you doing, sir?

238
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:44,340
What's this for?

239
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:45,940
You resisted arrest,

240
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,180
attacked police,

241
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:48,940
and was in possession
of offensive weapons.

242
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:49,820
I have every reason to arrest you.

243
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:50,820
Behave yourself,

244
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,420
or I will charge you
with obstructing official duties.

245
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:53,580
Hello?

246
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:54,260
Yes.

247
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:55,180
Got it.

248
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:56,460
I will send it after the statement.

249
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:57,380
Alright.

250
00:14:59,100 --> 00:14:59,500
My hand...

251
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:00,140
It's broken.

252
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:01,620
You are hopeless.

253
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:02,700
How dare you steal things
in the police station?

254
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:03,700
Keep a closer eye.

255
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:04,980
You should be glad
that he didn't try to steal your gun.

256
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:05,740
Okay. Thank you.

257
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:07,260
Mr. Wu,

258
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:09,220
are you aware that someone created

259
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:10,380
the chaos outside on purpose?

260
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:12,580
Someone has declared war on us indeed.

261
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:13,860
Their goal

262
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:14,900
is Chun Yat-wai.

263
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:16,180
We cannot keep any of the suspects

264
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:17,100
we just caught here.

265
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,020
I've asked
Western District Police Station

266
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:19,900
for assistance.

267
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:21,620
They should take the suspects from us.

268
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:23,220
The higher-up also approved

269
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:25,460
that if there are indeed
too many people,

270
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:26,660
they can be transferred to the prison

271
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:28,380
for temporary custody.

272
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:35,220
It's not going to be easy.

273
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:37,500
We cannot let them get their way.

274
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:05,220
Mr. Hon Gong.

275
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:13,500
Nice.

276
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:17,460
Watch out.

277
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:19,940
You are walking too fast.

278
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:20,860
Alright.

279
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:22,020
Go back.

280
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:23,420
Watch out.

281
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:24,460
Easy.

282
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:25,180
Take it easy.

283
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:29,460
Your pills.

284
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:42,700
You have half an hour.

285
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:43,500
Go take a shower.

286
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:49,780
Mr. Hon Gong!

287
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:50,460
What's wrong?

288
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:55,980
Mr. Hon Gong, are you okay?

289
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:56,860
Go away.

290
00:16:58,340 --> 00:16:59,100
Go!

291
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:01,500
Go!

292
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:03,780
Mr. Hon Gong,

293
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:05,140
this is hospital.

294
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:08,300
Right. It's the hospital.

295
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:08,940
Hey,

296
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:09,940
how about this?

297
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:11,300
Get me some chick here

298
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:12,740
and let her pretend to be a nurse.

299
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:19,620
It's Mr. Hon Lit.

300
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:20,900
Hey,

301
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:22,300
take care of Lit.

302
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:26,140
It's okay. Take them with you.

303
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:27,340
Go.

304
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:28,540
Don't wimp out.

305
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:30,860
Hey, Lo Keung,

306
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:32,540
two chicks, got it?

307
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:53,220
Yat-wai,

308
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:55,100
you are my son.

309
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:56,940
I will not leave you behind.

310
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,980
I won't do that no matter what.

311
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:00,620
Do you hear me?

312
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:14,620
Let go!

313
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:31,820
Congratulations.

314
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:34,100
So this is your plan
to lure them out, right?

315
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:35,380
Wait.

316
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:39,340
Tell me.

317
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,300
Share with me.

318
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:44,420
It's simple.

319
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:47,220
Since they cannot send people in,

320
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:48,340
they have to find someone

321
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:50,180
who is already here in custody to do it.

322
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:51,620
I checked.

323
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:53,620
Of those who are already here,

324
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:55,060
two are waiting for trial.

325
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:56,140
They are the most likely ones

326
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:58,260
because they both work for Hon Fui-lung.

327
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:00,340
And one of the two

328
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:01,060
made a call

329
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:02,540
after Chun Yat-wai

330
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:03,540
was caught.

331
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:05,300
Then he told our fellow

332
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:06,220
that he had to go to the toilet

333
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:07,300
because of his stomachache.

334
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:09,220
I didn't step in

335
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:10,460
and let him go.

336
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:11,740
So you

337
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:13,180
let Chun Yat-wai in

338
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:14,180
to bait him?

339
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:15,380
That's right.

340
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:16,620
Impressive.

341
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:19,380
Before we send Chun Yat-wai
to the court safely,

342
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:20,860
this job is not done.

343
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:22,380
That's why in the future,

344
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:25,260
I need you to keep it up.

345
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:28,180
I will get back to work, Mr. Wu.

346
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:30,180
Wait.

347
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:31,500
Last question.

348
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:33,140
I really want to ask you about it.

349
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:35,460
Did he really have a stomachache,

350
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,340
or did he fake it?

351
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,060
You can check the toilet yourself.

352
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:53,660
Mr. Hon Lit,

353
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:56,180
we've taken care of the compensation

354
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:57,900
for the men arrested today.

355
00:20:58,580 --> 00:20:59,620
How about Lik,

356
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:02,060
the one with lifetime sentence
because of murder?

357
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:02,820
Other than money,

358
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:04,980
we also gave an apartment to his family.

359
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:07,900
For Chun Yat-wai's life,

360
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:09,100
it's worth it.

361
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:14,660
Hello?

362
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:21,580
Mr. Hon Lit,

363
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:23,300
Lik failed.

364
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:39,300
It's only a problem of time.

365
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:42,020
There will be plenty of chances

366
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:44,100
when he is in prison.

367
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:12,020
Madam,

368
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:13,140
this area is cleared.

369
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:28,740
Dad.

370
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:29,740
Yat-wai.

371
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:30,340
Grandma.

372
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:37,100
Ms. Tong,

373
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:39,020
Yat-wai told me on the phone yesterday

374
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:40,860
that someone tried to kill him.

375
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:42,380
We've guaranteed

376
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:43,780
the safety of the suspect

377
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:45,020
during custody.

378
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:46,500
And now,

379
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:48,500
he is safely sent to the court.

380
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:51,060
About what you mentioned,

381
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:52,260
we will deal with it accordingly.

382
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:53,900
As for the details,

383
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:55,220
I don't think

384
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:56,500
I have to report to you, Mr. Chun.

385
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:58,820

that evading responsibility

436
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:55,820

00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:20,540
that was tried recently.

577
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:22,020
Mr. Lo, do you have any thought on that?

578
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:24,180
I will not comment

579
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:25,340
on any specific case,

580
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:27,500
because we have to respect

581
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:28,940
the decision of the court.

582
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:30,900
However, we can

583
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:32,820
talk about it

584
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:33,860
in terms of rule of law.

585
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:35,860
In any case,

586
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:37,260
if someone knows the law

587
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:39,100
but chooses to break it,

588
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:41,460
and even encourages others
to avoid responsibility,

589
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:43,580
using their influence

590
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:45,540
to interfere with judicial proceedings,

591
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:47,380
then this not only

592
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:49,540
crosses the legal boundary,

593
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:50,900
but also shakes

594
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:52,940
the very foundation of the legal system.

595
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:54,900
If a case

596
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:57,100
involves a high-ranking public official

597
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:58,340
obstructing judicial fairness,

598
00:31:58,340 --> 00:31:59,420
how should it be handled?

599
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:01,420
I would strongly recommend

600
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:02,820
the relevant authorities

601
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:04,260
launching an immediate investigation

602
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:06,220
to bring those who are guilty

603
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:07,540
to justice.

604
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:09,860

605
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:11,540
this Lo

606
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:13,060
is making it personal now.

607
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:15,580
He is using the radio interview
to attack you.

608
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:16,860
That's because he is afraid

609
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:18,220
of losing the chief justice to you.

610
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:19,940
What he just said

611
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:22,260
could heat up the public discussion.

612
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:23,940
They would say that as a judge

613
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:25,260
you bend the law for your interest.

614
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:30,740
Why are you not reacting

615
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:32,140
but allowing them?

616
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:34,260
What he did

617
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:35,740
could make Yat-wai safe.

618
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:39,340
He is manipulating the media,

619
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:41,500
so can we.

620
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:45,180
As the retired Chief Justice,

621
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:48,300
it's my honor and my duty

622
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:49,460
to work for the cause

623
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:50,660

624
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:52,060
and interests of women.

625
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:54,020
Today, in our society,

626
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:57,220
there is a breeding ground for violence
that is often overlooked,

627
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:59,220
and that's the prison.

628
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:02,220
One of the main purposes of imprisonment

629
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:03,820
is to give offenders

630
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:05,580
a chance to reform.

631
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:07,460
However, if they remain

632
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:09,820
surrounded by violence in prison,

633
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:11,900
whether as perpetrators

634
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:13,220
or as victims,

635
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:15,820
their humanity will be deeply distorted.

636
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:17,260
It will become

637
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:18,580
all the more difficult for them

638
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:20,340
to return to society in the future.

639
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:21,420
Violence

640
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:23,260
not only harms individuals,

641
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:25,420
but hurts the society as a whole.

642
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:27,220
We should step up

643
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:28,460
and work toward building

644
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:29,740
a society

645
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:31,260
that is more just

646
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:32,660
and compassionate.

to have a fresh start

651

and return to the society in the future.

652
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:47,740
It will reduce the re-offending rate

653

Do you have anything to say?

690
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:28,380
The Correctional Services Department
has done a very good job,

691
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:29,780
but I do think

692
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:31,420
there is room for improvement.

693
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:33,220
Could you elaborate, please?

694
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:36,700
We should focus on the mental health

695
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:37,820
and education of the inmates,

696
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:39,340
especially in terms

697
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:41,980
of the social discussion
about violence lately.

698
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:44,180
If such discussion

699
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:45,860
reaches the prison,

700
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:47,540
it will surely affect

701
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:48,860
the reform of the inmates.

702
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:50,780
That's why I would definitely not allow

703
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:52,300
the spread of hatred or violence

00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:55,500
Are you referring

706
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:57,260
to the verbal abuse
against Mr. Chun Yue lately?

707
00:35:58,460 --> 00:35:59,340
Thank you for reminding me.

708
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:01,220
This is a good example.

709
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:03,780
I think if someone breaks the law

710
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:05,380
and receives due punishment,

711
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:06,860
it should come to a close.

712

However, a lot of people

713
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:11,060
resort to verbal abuse
as a personal attack recently.

714
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:13,020
This is definitely

715
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:14,100
not allowed.

00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:57,260
I didn't notice it myself.

767
00:38:57,620 --> 00:38:59,020
One day without your coffee,

768
00:38:59,020 --> 00:38:59,860
I will feel uncomfortable.

769
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:01,380
Wait a second.

770
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:02,500
I will make yours right away.

771
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:02,860
Thank you.

772
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:19,260
[Hokong Maximum Security Prison]

773
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:20,460
I'm sorry.

774
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:22,060
Lik

775
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:23,660
failed.

776
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:27,860
There is an entire year.

777
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:29,900
We still have time.

778
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:30,500
Don't worry.

779
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:33,180
It's all because
of that legislative council member.

780
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:34,540
He went for an inspection in the prison,

781
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:36,340
and now everything is under close watch.

782
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:39,300
As I said, we have time.
There's no rush.

783
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:42,660
Lo Keung said

784
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:45,940
your brother was asking for a priest.

785
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:48,220
Gong said

786
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:50,460
the seizure was because of ghosts.

787
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:52,100
He doesn't want to take the pills,

788
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:54,060
so he wants a priest
to exorcise the ghosts.

789
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:56,860
His brain
is definitely having a problem.

790
00:39:57,940 --> 00:39:58,820
I don't think so.

791
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:00,900
Other than the priest,

792
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:02,100
he also asks for some chicks.

793
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:05,060
I think he's completely fine.

794
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:18,620
Lit,

795
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:21,900
you two have a good relationship.

796
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:23,940
The future of the Hon family

797
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:26,420
is on your hands.

798
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:29,500
You didn't like to be part of it,

799
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:32,220
so I kept you from a lot of things.

800
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:34,060
Because of that,

801
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:35,420
you didn't understand

802
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:37,580
many of my decisions.

803
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:42,260
Twenty years ago,

804
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:43,540
the reason

805
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:45,300
I came to power so quickly

806
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:48,580
was because

807
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:49,700
I was chosen

808
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:50,980
by a very powerful group.

809
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:52,700
How powerful?

810
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:55,100
Politicians and businessmen?

811
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:02,860
Police and gangs?

812
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:05,780
All of them.

813
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:08,620
They never show their faces.

814
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:12,220
They only send messages
through middlemen.

815
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:14,060
I work for them,

816
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:16,260
and they support me.

817
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:18,140
That's why

818
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:21,620
we get to grow and become so powerful.

819
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:24,620
Since they have all the power,

820
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:26,460
why are you still in jail?

821
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:29,100
I was too arrogant,

822
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:31,460
so they gave me a lesson

823
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:34,020
with this attacking case.

824
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:36,900
We've agreed

825
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:39,540
on my future interest.

826
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:41,860
Is it worth it?

827
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:43,140
Yes.

828
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:45,860
It supports you two to rise to power

829
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:47,180
and allows

830
00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:49,540
the Hon Group

831
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:51,060
to own

832
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:54,020
the biggest gambling business in Hokong.

833
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:56,060
It is definitely worth it.

834
00:41:57,900 --> 00:42:00,100
We are not far from this goal now.

835
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:02,500
The land acquisition of the old town

836
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:04,140
will be initiated soon.

837
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:06,900
We don't need to do any extras.

838
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:08,620
Just retain our power.

839
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:11,660
People who care only about interest

840
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:13,700
speak of no moral principle.

841
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:15,380
We are in the open,
while they hide in the shadows.

842
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:17,300
Isn't it disadvantageous for us?

843
00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:21,060
Their identity is highly confidential,

844
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:22,740
but there are some signs

845
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:25,580
that common people will not notice.

846
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:29,060
Whenever you see them, be alarmed.

847
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:34,900
Clubs

848
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:37,100
represent us,

849
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:38,580
the gangs.

850
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:42,420
Diamonds,

851
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:44,060
hearts,

852
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:46,820
and spades

853
00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:49,100
are the businessmen,

854
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:50,420
police,

855
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:51,740
and politicians.

856
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:53,740
When you see them,

857
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:55,260
be careful.

858
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:56,700
Be on guard.

859
00:42:57,460 --> 00:42:58,860
You can't mess with them.

860
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:00,860
You can't offend them.

861
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:03,460
They are all about interest,

862
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:08,780
and that

863
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:11,180
is your biggest weapon.

864
00:43:11,180 --> 00:43:11,940
Do you understand?

865
00:43:47,380 --> 00:43:47,900
Son?

866
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:51,140
Go be at your sister, alright?

867
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:52,100
Good boy.

868
00:43:58,620 --> 00:44:00,580
Check and see what else you need.

869
00:44:01,620 --> 00:44:03,100
I can hold on for a while,

870
00:44:04,060 --> 00:44:05,780
but not for long, not with my kids.

871
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:09,780
Any news from the old town?

872
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:11,860
My dad sent a message in secret

873
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:13,300
that Chi Cheung-wing's men

874
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:14,580
were all behaving themselves suddenly.

875
00:44:15,020 --> 00:44:16,100
They didn't fight or kill anyone,

876
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:17,220
or set anything on fire.

877
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:19,420
But they did send someone to my place.

878
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:21,260
They are probably

879
00:44:21,820 --> 00:44:22,420
suspecting me.

880
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:24,500
Because

881
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:26,180
you are the last person who saw him.

882
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:28,020
They will never guess

883
00:44:28,340 --> 00:44:29,300
that you are still here.

884
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:32,580
If Chi Cheung-wing's body is found,

885
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:34,380
not only the old town,

886
00:44:34,820 --> 00:44:36,100
the police will not spare me either,

887
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:37,780
so I have to leave as soon as possible.

888
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:40,660
I will arrange it,

889
00:44:41,620 --> 00:44:42,820
but after Friday. Is that okay?

890
00:44:43,060 --> 00:44:43,700
Why?

891
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:46,540
Is there anything more important

892
00:44:46,540 --> 00:44:47,100
than this now?

893
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:51,140
Because on that day, someone will die.

894
00:44:58,220 --> 00:44:59,220
I will send you away.

895
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:01,580
I promised Wai.

896
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:24,980
Mr. Chun!

897
00:45:36,820 --> 00:45:38,020
I bought these to the kids.

898
00:45:42,860 --> 00:45:44,140
Be careful.

899
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:47,180
Be safe.

900
00:45:47,980 --> 00:45:48,700
