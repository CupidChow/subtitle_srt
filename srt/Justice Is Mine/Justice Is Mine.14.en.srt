15

where have you taken my children?

16
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:40,660
Give my children back to me!

But if you act crazy,

I can't guarantee that'll stay the case.

So what do you want?

Are you trying to kill me

23
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:03,260
I did think about it.

24
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:05,500
You actually wanted to kill me.

25
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:08,300
Too bad the gods are blind.

26

This is a desert island.

Is the public security
in the old town this bad?

00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:12,540
it's our problem to solve.

What do you mean?

00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:36,620
You're the leader of the old town gang.

72

If you're put in charge
of developing the old town,

73
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:41,220
then I'll be

74
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:42,620

in the old town

78

is Uncle Chen.

We'll be doomed
if we rely on those old folks.

82
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:58,700
How could they possibly
break the old and build the new?

83
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:01,860
The "pie" of the old town
is only this big.

84

How many people can it feed?

If you don't tear down
what's old and start anew,

86
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:07,540
the pie will never get any bigger.

residence, and entertainment,

It's not that it can't be changed.

186
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:21,900
The second phase is about to kick off.

187
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:24,180
Once we successfully acquire
the land in the old town,

188
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:25,660
I'll start the project right away.

189
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:27,580
I'm confident

190
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:29,660
we'll create

191
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:30,940
a second economic miracle.

192
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:35,060
Mr. Tat,

193
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:37,740
you were part of the first phase.

194
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:39,340
When it comes to rewarding merit,

195
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:42,860
if you want a share of the second phase,

196
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,180
it all depends on
how much you contribute.

197
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:48,340
I'll clear the obstacles
no matter what it takes.

198
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:50,060
Leave it to me.

199
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:53,340
Cheers.

Back then, when Lui Biu and I
joined the task force

201
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:06,700
[Green River Sauna]
for the Fu-Ngam arson case,

202
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:07,700
Tat Ga-ma wasn't on the team,

203
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:10,060
but Lui Biu was his good friend.

204
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:12,300
I heard Lui Biu retired early

205
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:13,660
and later opened a sauna parlor.

206
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:15,180
Thanks, Mr. Pang.

We've looked everywhere
and still can't find him.

209
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:34,860
Where could he have gone?

Your friend is missing.

211
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:37,940
We've searched the entire hospital,
and there's no sign of him.

214
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:10,220
I think I need to be away for a while.

215
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:11,100
We

216
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:12,780
shouldn't contact each other
for the time being.

217
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:15,100
You must not get involved
in this matter.

218
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:17,300
Are they going to target you?

219
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,460
Anyway, you need
to be careful with Tat Ga-ma.

220
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,860
If Tat Ga-ma silenced Lau Mao,

221
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:24,820
that means

222
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:26,220
anything could happen.

223
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:28,580
What about you?

224
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:31,980
I know another witness.

225
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:34,340
If I can find him,

226
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:35,300
I'm confident

227
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:36,580
I can arrest Tat Ga-ma.

228
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:38,740

I will.

00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:43,460
Once I'm done with this,
I'll come back to you.

00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:46,260
Go back.

233
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:53,940
Don't worry.

There are over fifty cameras

did you send someone to the hospital

258
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:29,060
to get the surveillance footage
and review it?

259
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:34,380
Yes.

260
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,180
Didn't you say Chun Yue

262
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:40,220
I did.

263
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:42,020
Then why are you
still investigating this?

264
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:44,060

00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:54,900
After a preliminary forensic examination,

326
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:57,060
it matches

00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:58,820

329
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:02,380
Additionally, according to
the suspect's statement,

330
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:05,620
he claimed that he got into a conflict
with Sek Chi-yeung

331
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:06,700
over unequal distribution of profits,

332
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:08,860
and that he accidentally killed him
in the heat of the moment.

333
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:12,060
What?

334
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:14,460

342
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:29,460
you must stay calm

if you want to solve this matter,

344
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:32,620

to prosecute.

to handle the trial.

if you have any special instructions,
Chief Justice.

356
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:26,460
How would I dare to give any?

357
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:27,940
Even one extra word,

358
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:30,700
and I'd be charged
with interfering with judicial justice.

359
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:32,020
You have more experience

360
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:34,220
in this kind of thing than I do.

361
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:36,700
Right now, this case

362
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:37,660
has the whole city's attention.

363
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:39,460
It's perfect for repairing our image.

364
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:41,020
Make sure you seize this opportunity.

and I did it on the spur of the moment.]

368
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:55,980
and this suspect

369
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:58,180

to being the killer of Hon Gong.

370

Any questions?

00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:07,780
No.

372
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:16,020
Mr. Chun,

373
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:17,740
Mr. Ong is here to see you.

374
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:19,020
Mr. Chun,

375
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:19,620
sorry

376
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:21,140
for not making an appointment.

377
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:22,580
I hope I'm not interrupting your work.

378
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:24,540
Come in.

379
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:25,140
OK.

380
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:38,860
[Judge Chun Yue]

381
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:41,700
[Chun Yue goes to a coffee shop
at 13:15 every day.]

382
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:47,220
[Timeline and clues
of Hon Gong's murder case]

383
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:50,980
I took care of the things
on Hon Lit's side.

384
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:53,740
But this Madam is keeping an eye on you.

385
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:57,100
Persistence

386
00:25:57,340 --> 00:25:58,420
is one of her strengths,

387
00:25:59,100 --> 00:25:59,940
but if we're going to prosecute,

388
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:01,540
we have to go by the evidence.

389
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:03,340
But I think if we can resolve

390
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:05,420
all issues with a single case,

391
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:07,540
we can save ourselves
a lot of unnecessary trouble.

392
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:10,500
If the charges of manslaughter

393
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:11,700
and drug trafficking

394
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:13,420
are served concurrently,

395
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:15,260
the maximum sentence
for Sek Chi-yeung's case

396
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:17,660
would be no more than 15 years.

397
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:20,380
But Hon Gong's case is murder.

398
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:24,060
The maximum sentence
for that is 25 years.

399
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:27,220
Is it because your son

400
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:28,140
is in prison

401
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:29,900
that you have extra sympathy

402
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:31,020
for these inmates?

403
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:34,340
Actually, 25 years and 25 months

404
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:35,260
are the same to them.

405
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:37,460
It's their choice.

406
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:39,620
Similarly,

407
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:42,300
this is your choice too.

408
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:45,220
I won't keep you occupied.

409
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:01,340
Tong Huen,

410
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:03,180
Sek Chi-yeung's girlfriend.

411
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:04,020
what do you think of her?

412
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:05,580
She's Wu Kin's apprentice.

413
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:07,940
Just like that dim-witted man,

414
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:09,260
no one can ever talk any sense to her.

415
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:11,580
How much do you think she knows?

416
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:13,500
Given her personality,

417
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:14,980
if she knew anything,

418
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:16,340
she'd definitely blow the whistle.

419
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:17,580
She wouldn't stay this quiet.

420
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:21,060
Until this case is tried,

421
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:23,460
it's better to play it safe.

422
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:27,540
Ever since
Sek Chi-yeung's case happened,

423
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:28,740
you've been on leave.

424
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:31,380
It's time to return to work.

425
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:38,140
It's said the senior police officer
who was killed

426
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:40,020
[Tat Ga-ma, Chief Superintendent]
fell out with drug dealers over profits.

427
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:41,460
Do you have any comments?

428
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:44,220
The case has already entered
judicial proceedings,

429
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:46,940
and it's not appropriate
to make any comments at this stage.

430
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:50,180
However, the police force
is a law enforcement agency.

431
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:51,060
For a long time,

432
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:52,780
we have adhered to the core values

433
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:54,940
of integrity and upholding justice.

434
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:57,140
We will never tolerate anyone
who violates the law while knowing it.

435
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:00,380
This scumbag is pretending
to be a decent person.

436
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:02,940
Can you even stand listening to him?

437
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:09,700
Then you tell me.

438
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:11,460
What's the truth?

439
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:13,740
Tat Ga-ma silenced Sek Chi-yeung,

440
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:15,260
and then framed him.

441
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:16,300
That's the truth.

442
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:17,900
Tat Ga-ma is a Chief Superintendent.

443
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:19,940
This accusation of yours
is extremely serious.

444
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:28,060
Sek is already dead.

445
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:31,780
And they're framing him like this.

446
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:38,540
Sir.

447
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:39,020
Madam.

448
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:41,580
Mr. Kwu from C&IIB

449
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:42,740
wants to see you.

450
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:45,060
Sorry,

451
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:46,460
what is it this time?

452
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:48,420
A handbag was found

453
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:49,340
in Sek Chi-yeung's home,

454
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:50,540
which belongs to Ms. Tong.

455
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:52,180
Inside it, we discovered some drugs.

456
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:53,660
Drugs?

457
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:54,340
We've confirmed

458
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:54,860
that those drugs…

459
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:55,860
How many more people
are you planning to frame?

460
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:57,580
They are from the same batch

461
00:28:57,580 --> 00:28:58,500
as the ones found on the killer

462
00:28:58,500 --> 00:28:59,740
who murdered Sek Chi-yeung.

463
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:01,180
That's why we want to take Ms. Tong

464
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:02,100
to assist with the investigation.

465
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:03,380
This is an arrest warrant

466
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:05,140
issued directly by Headquarters.

467
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:06,420
We're just following orders.

468
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:08,300
We'll fully cooperate,

469
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:10,420
but let's not make things difficult
for each other.

470
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:29,220
Do you need to put handcuffs on me,

471
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:29,980
Mr. Kwu?

472
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:43,620
Why did you hide

473
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:45,060
your relationship with Sek Chi-yeung?

474
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:53,740
Who I'm with is my personal privacy.

475
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:56,140
Which law says I have to disclose it?

476
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:58,180
We found your handbag

477
00:29:58,220 --> 00:29:59,260
at Sek Chi-yeung's home,

478
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:00,660
and inside it, we found drugs and money.

479
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:01,620
How do you explain that?

480
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:04,060
I've said it many times.

481
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:06,380
That bag is mine,

482
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:09,300
but none of the things inside
belongs to me.

483
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:12,700
Let her listen to this statement.

484
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:16,860
Hon Fui-lung is in prison,

485
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:18,260
and Hon Lit couldn't even manage
the business properly.

486
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:19,700
Sek Chi-yeung took advantage

487
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:21,380
of his access
o the Intelligence Bureau's information

488
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:22,980
to embezzle
a lot of the Hon family's goods.

489
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:25,540
Later, when he found out
Hon Gong had woken up,

490
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:27,460
he forced me to kill Hon Gong.

491
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:28,780
He wanted to make sure the Hon family

492
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:30,260
could never get back on their feet.

493
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:34,340
What does this have to do with Hon Gong?

494
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:36,380
Isn't this ridiculous?

495
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:37,860
That's something we need to ask you.

496
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:42,420
In short, if you don't cooperate,

497
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:43,660
I'll keep asking nonstop

498
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:45,060
until we get an answer.

499
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:50,580
Prosecution,

500
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:52,340
do you have any additional evidence

501
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:53,180
to present?

502
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:54,220
[Prosecutor]
Your Honor,

503
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:55,460
this

504
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:57,180
is the prosecution's latest evidence.

505
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:00,740
What's the difference
between this and the previous one?

506
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:02,660
After further investigation
by the police,

507
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:04,740
it was discovered that the defendant
had connections to the old town.

508
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:07,020
The prosecution
has obtained several new statements,

509
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:08,260
which are on page five.

510
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:12,140
The trial for Sek Chi-yeung's case
has already begun.

511
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:14,140
Right now,

512
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:15,340
we're giving you a chance to confess.

513
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:16,740
If you don't cherish it,

514
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:18,460
you'll definitely regret it.

515
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:20,460
We've reviewed the evidence.

516
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:22,340
Defendant, do you have anything to add?

517
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:23,300
Your Honor,

518
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:25,060
my client wishes

519
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:26,420
to personally state
the background of the case.

520
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:28,540
We believe this will be
significant reference for sentencing.

521
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:29,580
We earnestly request your approval.

522
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:30,460
Approved.

523
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:38,860
Your Honor,

524
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:40,700
I didn't mean to kill him.

525
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:42,380
He forced me to commit murder,

526
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:43,860
forced me to hand over money,

527
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:44,940
and even forced me to deliver goods.

528
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:46,100
He was a police officer

529
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:47,060
with a high rank.

530
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:48,940
I was really pushed to the edge by him.

531
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:53,620
So it was really him.

532
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:00,140
And back then,

533
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:00,860
as soon as I…

534
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:01,940
as soon as I mentioned
breaking off the partnership,

535
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:03,340
he turned on me right away.

536
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:05,020
He said he'd arrest me
on charges of murder

537
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:06,820
and drug trafficking.

538
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:08,500
He used me and ditched me.

539
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:09,540
I was terrified.

540
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:10,940
I only resisted
because I had no other choice.

541
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:12,540
Drop the act.

542
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:14,660
Given your relationship
with Sek Chi-yeung,

543
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:16,740
you must have been in cahoots
with him a long time ago,

544
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:17,500
isn't that right?

545
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:26,260
He had a gun at the time.

546
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:28,500
I picked up a knife
just to defend myself.

547
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:29,940
I never thought

548
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:31,100
that when we struggled,

549
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:32,300
the knife would stab into his body.

550
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:32,940
Your Honor,

551
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:33,980
I didn't mean to kill him!

552
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:39,340
Prosecution,

553
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:41,460
do you have anything else to add?

554
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:43,300
No, Your Honor.

555
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:51,820
Have some water.

556
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:53,860
The evidence
that Sek Chi-yeung took bribes

557
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:54,940
is conclusive.

558
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:56,260
Besides,

559
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:57,340
he's already dead.

560
00:32:57,980 --> 00:32:59,140
You don't have to take the blame

561
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:00,340
or him.

562
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:04,460
The evidence in this case

563
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:05,780
is clear and well-organized.

564
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:07,980
The prosecution has brought

565
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:09,820
two charges against the defendant:

566
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:11,180
the manslaughter of Sek Chi-yeung

567
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:12,220
and the murder of Han Gang.

568
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:14,340
The defendant has also confessed
and admitted to the crimes.

569
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:15,860
Taking into account

570
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:16,860
that the defendant
committed the offenses

571
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:18,940
under threats from a police officer,

572
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:20,780
in accordance
with the relevant provisions

573
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:22,820
of Article 128 of the Criminal Law,

574
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:24,980
the defendant is sentenced

575
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:26,780
to 12 years of imprisonment.

576
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:28,220
Additionally,

577
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:30,380
the police officer
involved in this case,

578
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:31,300
Sek Chi-yeung,

579
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:35,540
used his authority
to engage in criminal activities,

580
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:36,940
and the prima facie evidence
of this is established.

581
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:39,380
However, since he is dead,

582
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:41,780
no legal liability
will be pursued against him

583
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:43,900
in accordance with relevant regulations.

584
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:46,220
Court is adjourned.

585
00:33:58,340 --> 00:33:58,900
Mr. Hu,

586
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:00,340
you have 15 minutes.

587
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:02,060
Thank you.

588
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:14,260
How are you?

589
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:22,900
The verdict
for Sek Chi-yeung's case is in.

590
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:25,660
The killer was sentenced
to 12 years in prison.

591
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:27,380
As for Sek Chi-yeung,

592
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:28,540
he abused his authority

593
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:30,180
to engage in criminal activities.

594
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:36,220
Hey.

595
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:47,220
Do you also believe he was a dirty cop?

596
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:50,300
Does it matter?

597
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:53,060
Right now, the most important thing

598
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:54,940
is finding a way to get you out of here.

599
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:58,060
Get out?

600
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:03,620
If I do get out,
will I still be a police officer?

601
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:06,260
What's wrong with you?

602
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:09,060
The Tong Huen I know

603
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:12,060
would never be like this.

604
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:13,460
She never gives up.

605
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:21,780
Whose interests

606
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:24,220
did Sek Chi-yeung actually violate?

607
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:28,900
Tat Ga-ma?

608
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:32,980
He knew Tat Ga-ma

609
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:35,900
obstructed justice

610
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:38,620
in an arson case.

611
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:40,740
Is there any evidence?

612
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:46,980
There was a witness before,

613
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:49,620
but he's gone missing.

614
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:53,780
Chances are
that he's also met with a bad end.

615
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:00,180
If so many people and resources

616
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:01,500
were used to destroy the evidence

617
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:03,060
and eliminate traces,

618
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:04,420
that means Tat Ga-ma

619
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:05,980
is extremely wary of this matter.

620
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:08,660
In that case,

621
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:10,940
we'll use this matter

622
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:13,220
to make a bet with Tat Ga-ma.

623
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:18,100
What kind of bet?

624
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:19,700
A bet to get you out of here.

625
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:22,300
Do you really like staying here

626
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:23,380
and letting him torture you?

627
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:47,460
Let's celebrate.

632

633

634

How rare, Hu.

What are you doing here?

642
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:17,420
Do you have to get your wife's approval?

643
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:18,700
Otherwise,

644
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:20,780
severe punishment
will be waiting for you at home.

645
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:24,100
Mr. Tat.

646
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:26,860
I'd like a word with you in private.

647
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:30,580
Why not share it
with everyone else here?

648
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:31,540
You talk.

649
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:32,580
I flirt.

650
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:36,300
Talk about your filthy history here?

651
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:40,620
I sure can if you don't mind.

652
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:42,540
What are you implying?

653
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:47,220
You flirt.

654
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:49,220
I talk.

655
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:51,500
Don't you ever regret it.

656
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:54,500
Leave.

657

Let's go.

We'll go to the chamber next door.

Shoot.

661
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:06,660
Tong Huen told me

662
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:10,740
Sek Chi-yeung had a classified file

663
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:12,660
handed over
to a friend who was a lawyer.

664
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:16,540
I went to this lawyer today

665
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:17,980
and told him

666
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:20,300
Sek Chi-yeung

667
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:22,020
had been identified as a dirty cop.

668
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:23,940
His possession

669
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:26,420
may involve serious crimes.

670
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:28,660
Keeping it unlawfully

671
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:30,180
may make him

672
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:30,980
an accomplice.

673
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:32,860
Hearing that,

674
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:34,500
he was so scared,

675
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:36,060
and voluntarily,

676
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:38,060
he gave me the file.

677
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:42,020
Where is it?

678
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:47,860
Show me.

679
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:49,140
Patience.

680
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:53,740
You're here in exchange
for something, huh?

681
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:56,340
Do you remember when we were partners,

682
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:57,540
you used to tell me

683
00:38:58,180 --> 00:38:59,780
it doesn't matter
how many chips you have

684
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:02,220
as long as you bet on the right side.

685
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:08,660
If you followed my lead back then,

686
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:09,540
you

687
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:11,300
would be a superintendent now, at least.

688
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:14,780
No one

689
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:16,540
can rewrite history.

690
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:18,820
So I'm looking at
what's lying ahead for me.

691
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:22,940
Today, I've decided

692
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:26,380
to place this bargaining chip on you.

693
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:28,580
What on earth are you trying to say?

694
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:31,740
There used to be so many things

695
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:32,740
that made me wonder.

696
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:34,020
Now I've realized

697
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:35,500
nothing truly matters

698
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:36,940
except for one thing,

699
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:39,180
tangible benefits.

700
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:43,660
Then how many times the stake

701
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:45,340
do you plan to win with this chip?

702
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:46,460
To be honest,

703
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:49,380
I have no idea

704
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:51,980
if it contains devastating proof

705
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:53,580
or just some scrap paper

706
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:56,020
you'll toss in the trash after reading.

707
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:57,260
I'm just thinking

708
00:39:57,900 --> 00:39:59,100
that since Sek Chi-yeung's case

709
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:01,020
has been ruled on,

710
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:03,220
and Tong Huen has told me

711
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:04,620
the only thing that she knew.

712
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:07,580
If the documents inside are useful,

713
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:09,380
giving Tong Huen back to me

714
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:11,180
would sound like a fair trade.

717
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:24,500

Mr. Chun,

since the defendant
in the police killing case

was acquitted of murder

794
00:47:51,580 --> 00:47:52,660
and instead convicted of manslaughter,

795
00:47:52,660 --> 00:47:54,900
[Chun Yue, Court of Second Instance]
does this mean the court believes

796
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:56,460
Sek Chi-yeung was actually involved
in illegal activities?

797
00:47:56,460 --> 00:47:57,580
In this case,

798
00:47:58,100 --> 00:48:00,220
the court's sole responsibility
is to determine

whether the defendant committed murder,

00:48:02,540 --> 00:48:04,060
not to judge whether the deceased

801
00:48:04,380 --> 00:48:06,100
was involved in illegal acts.

802
00:48:06,540 --> 00:48:08,700
Any determination
regarding the deceased's involvement

803

The media

806

810
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:20,580
will HoKong be able to restore

its previous level of rule of law?

812
00:48:23,340 --> 00:48:24,980
This question
is fundamentally unfounded,

813
00:48:25,340 --> 00:48:27,020
because the standards
of HoKong's rule of law

814
00:48:27,900 --> 00:48:29,380

827
00:48:59,180 --> 00:49:00,700
