Lum Chin wouldn't disappear
for no reasons.

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:04,300
Hon Fui-lung is her man.

3
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:05,730
She should've noticed

4
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:06,890
that scar on him long ago.

5
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:08,250
Now she's gone,

6
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:09,540
and that leaves two options.

7
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:11,330
Either she warned him to run,

8
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:13,090
or she killed him for revenge.

9
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,540
Okay, I'll get people
to the hospital right away.

10
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:17,010
And I'll alert customs at the same time.

11
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:18,650
I'll go apply for a search warrant.

12
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,100
I was afraid she wouldn't be able
to get revenge

13
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:21,690
and might even have been silenced.

14
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:29,500
What are you doing?

15
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:31,100
It's too late to save him!

16
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:32,340
Going in now is suicide!

Listen to me!

Ms. Tong.

00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:40,100
I need

32
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:41,820
a search warrant
for Hon Fui-lung's place.

33
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,220
What's the reason?

Lum Chin's life

35
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:45,980
is at risk.

36
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:47,450
Why?

37
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:50,010
Why did you give me

38
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,500
the A05 statement?

39
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:53,850
Were you aware

40
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:55,170
that the arson was actually committed

41
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,540
by Hon Fui-lung?

42
00:02:58,380 --> 00:02:59,010
No.

43
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,410

Understood.

105
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:26,380
Not yet.

106
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:28,260
We need to do a forensic examination.

107
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:30,660
He's obviously burned to death.

108
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:32,380
What more is there to look into?

109
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:35,220
This is just routine protocol.

110
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:36,260
We're not targeting you.

111
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,020
Mr. Hon,

112
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:42,260
we'll need you to come down
to the station later

00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:49,100
My condolences.

115
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:52,460
I have nothing to say.

116
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:55,940
I don't know

117
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:58,780
why my dad was in that place.

118
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:00,340
What are your thoughts

119
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:02,260
on his death?

120
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:06,260
Seeing my dad die this way...

121
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:09,980
beyond the heartbreak...

122
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:12,380
I'm furious.

123
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:14,180
Your dad had a lot of enemies.

124
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:15,540
So, who do you think

125
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:18,220
was most likely to kill him?

126
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:23,500
Are you sure it was murder?

127
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:25,140
The autopsy report

128
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:26,660
will give us a clear answer.

129
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:31,140
Then let's wait for it.

130
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:33,780
Lum Chin is missing.

131
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:35,700
Aren't you worried,

132
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:36,860
or even a little nervous?

133
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:38,420
If I told you

134
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:39,860
I'm also looking for her,

135
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:41,980
would you believe me?

136
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:43,940
Where did you

137
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:44,820
last see her?

138
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:46,420
Who was she with?

139
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:51,380
Or maybe I'll throw out

140
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:53,420
a bolder theory.

141
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:58,380
Someone wanted
to take his father's place

142
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:00,180
and did something unforgivable.

143
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,740
But someone else saw it,

144
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:04,540
so he shut her up.

145
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:09,100
Ms. Tong!

146
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:18,700
You've got quite the imagination.

147
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:24,060
If you're planning to interrogate me,

148
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:26,740
call my lawyer.

149
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:29,980
No need for that just yet.

150
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:32,460
But you might want to have one ready.

151
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,020
Why so aggressive, Madam?

152
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:46,700
His dad just died.

153
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,660
Why grill him like this?

154
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:50,860
I don't think he did it.

155
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:54,980
Could Lum Chin be the killer?

156
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:58,540
Is she just in hiding,

157
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:01,460
or was she really silenced?

158
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:14,980
Mr. Hon Lit,

159
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,020
Mr. Tat and Mr. Ong are here.

160
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:38,140
What did you tell him two days ago?

161
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:40,700
What could I say?

162
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:43,180
Just told him to enjoy retirement

163
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:44,540
and stop obsessing

164
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,540
over Hon Gong.

165
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:48,740
He wouldn't listen.

166
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:52,460
I figured someone wanted
to teach him a lesson.

167
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:59,340
Now his girlfriend's missing too.

168
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:01,340
No corpse was found.

169
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:04,060
The land acquisition plan
is about to start.

170
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:06,220
Let's think about
how to control this situation.

171
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:11,580
Sorry,

172
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:13,760
Mr. Hon Lit is still distraught.

173
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:14,980
I hope you understand.

174
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:17,840
Got it.

175
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:20,220
Please pass on

176
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,220
my condolences to him.

177
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:23,460
I also need you to let him know

178
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:24,340
something important.

179
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:26,060
What was before

180
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:27,740
will stay the same.

181
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:28,820
Nothing's going to change.

182
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:30,500
I'll make sure

183
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:31,740
Mr. Hon Lit gets your message.

184
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:32,620
Thank you.

185
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:41,080
Lum Chin has been with Hon Fui-lung
for nearly 20 years.

186
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:43,700
She doesn't get involved
in triad affairs,

187
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:44,900
but her entire social circle

188
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:46,580
is tied to the Hons.

189
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:48,420
Simply put, Lum Chin

190
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,780

He may have been old,

was the real arsonist

259
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:23,040
came from the A05 statement

260

you gave me.

261

When Sek Chi-yeung asked you,

00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:30,660
you gave me this statement.

265

What was the reason behind that?

266

Who could possibly

to frame a CIP?

And

272
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:46,460
he can mobilize

273

resources across multiple fronts.

274
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:50,160
That means he's someone high up

275
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,860
in the police hierarchy.

276
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:55,180

it's Tat Ga-ma.

278

You knew this might point to him,

279
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:02,020
yet you still handed me that statement.

280
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:03,400
That tells me

00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:36,420
she won't make it

379
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:37,380
much longer.

380
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,080
Then make yourself clear,

381
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:40,700
so I can take you in without hesitation.

382
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:42,100
Let him in.

383
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:46,180
Lum Chin agreed to see him.

384
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:03,320
Why?

385
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:08,500
You were with my dad
for more than two decades.

386
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:12,420
He trusted you so much.

387
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:14,180
Why?

388
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:22,580
I spent over 20 years with your dad.

389
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:25,620
We shared a bed every single night.

390
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:29,860
Yes,

391
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:32,660
he trusted me a lot.

392
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:37,140
But he never told me

393
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:40,380
he was the one who murdered my family.

394
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:43,740
What happened?

395
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:48,180
I know it was you

396
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:50,380
who set fire to Shantytown back then.

397
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:55,780
You're the one who killed my parents

398
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,820
and my younger brother.

399
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:05,500
I'm just jealous of you.

400
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:06,780
Back then,

401
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:09,340
thanks to you torching Shantytown,

402
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:11,380
we took a great risk and made a fortune.

403
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:13,460
I never imagined

404
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:15,760
your biggest reward
would be falling for her.

405
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:22,860
Get this rope off me.

406
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:24,540
We can

407
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:26,380
talk this through.

408
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:29,100
You took 104 lives.

409
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:31,460
Why not mine too?

410
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:35,740
Why keep me by your side for 20 years?

411
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:40,240
Tat Ga-ma was right.

412
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:43,020
Great fortune comes with great risk.

413
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:44,740
That fire was inevitable.

414
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,740
Even if I hadn't done it,

415
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:49,060
he would have found
another one to set it.

416
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:55,900
The shanties burned down 20 years ago.

417
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:57,420
All this time,

418
00:20:57,860 --> 00:20:59,700
think about how I treated you.

419
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:01,820
Our feelings were real.

420
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,900
Think about our future.

421
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:08,380
Stop talking!

422
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,460
If you really wanted me dead,

423
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,500
you wouldn't have woken me up,
would you?

424
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,580
After all this time following me,

425
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:19,380
you still

426
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:20,780
haven't understood

427
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:22,820
that in this world,

428
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:24,460
every deal

429
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,540
is rigged,

430
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:28,300
and the one who walks away

431
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:30,220
with the biggest profit is the winner!

432
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:33,740
I don't know you!

433
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,900
I never knew you!

434
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,020
Killing me

435
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:38,500
won't make you the victor.

436
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:39,620
If I die,

437
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:41,700
the Hons will come for revenge!

438
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:43,820
You'll wish you were dead by then!

439
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:46,260
Let go of me!

440
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:48,020
What are you doing?

441
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:56,180
The arsonist...

442
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:00,380
died in flames.

443
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:04,340
Isn't this fate?

444
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:07,540
No, it isn't.

445
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:09,780
It's murder.

446
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:18,480
I agreed to see you

447
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:20,780
to give you an explanation...

448
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:27,260
because I was family to you.

449
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:28,500
No matter what he did,

450
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:29,540
he is still my dad!

451
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:30,260
Hey!

452
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:35,460
You will pay this debt

453
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,780
sooner or later.

454
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:45,140
I sought justice

455
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:46,700
for 104 lives.

456
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:51,300
That's 104 lives!

457
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:57,780
Trading my life for 104 others...

458
00:23:58,740 --> 00:23:59,820
is worth it.

459
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:09,780
Time's up.

460
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:19,140
Go.

461
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:21,220
Hurry up.

462
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:57,380
Is there a way to prevent Lum Chin
from testifying in court?

463
00:24:58,900 --> 00:24:59,980
What are you worried about?

464
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:03,340
Hon Fui-lung was so cunning.

465
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:04,380
How do I know

466
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:05,980
if he didn't hide some leverage

467
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:06,900
to protect himself?

468
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:09,700
His woman turned against him.

469
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:11,740
I don't want her to testify in court

470
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:12,980
and expose me as well.

471
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:14,900
Of course not.

472
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:18,380
This whole thing is strange.

473
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:19,580
But even I have no idea

474
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:21,260
where they're hiding that woman.

475
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:23,360
I haven't heard a word.

476
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:24,700
The most important thing now

477
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:26,540
is for you not to panic.

478
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:27,740
Hey.

479
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:29,860
I made a promise to the public

480
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:32,860
to stand up
for the rights of the vulnerable.

481
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:35,260
I can't turn my back on that now.

482
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:39,220
I guess she doesn't have
any concrete evidence.

483
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:42,780
Maybe I'm just too nervous.

484
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:44,760
Don't worry.

485
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:46,780
Mr. Chun's the one presiding.

486
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:48,620
He's on our side. You're good.

487
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:53,020
That's a relief.

488
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:09,060
Should we save him?

489
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:11,900
Don't waste time.

490
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:14,320
What's the name of the person

491
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:14,900
who usually worked for him?

492
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:17,100
It's Cheng A-kan.

493
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:19,260
Cheng A-kan.

494
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:23,580
Your Honor,

495
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:26,100
based on the defendant's
confession of guilt,

496
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:28,020
and the details of the murder
she provided,

497
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:29,640
which match the evidence
collected at the scene,

498
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:31,340
and with the cause of death

499
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:32,900
aligning with the forensic report,

500
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:35,100
[Prosecution]
the prosecution and the defendant

501
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:36,520
have reached a plea agreement.

502
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:39,180
The content of the agreement
has been submitted to the court.

503
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:40,300
Defendant,

504
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:42,100
do you choose to defend yourself

505
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:43,220
without retaining a lawyer?

506
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:44,300
[Attorney]

507
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:45,380
I admit to the murder.

508
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:46,620
I don't need a defense.

509
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:48,580
But I want to explain

510
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:49,620
why I did it.

511
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:52,500
The defendant may proceed.

512
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:54,460
My name is Lum Chin.

513
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:57,740
I am a survivor

514
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,580
of the Fu-Ngam Shantytown arson.

515
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:01,020
That fire

516
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:02,940
took 104 lives,

517
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:04,420
including my parents

518
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:05,860
and my younger brother.

519
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:08,000
And the real culprit of the arson

520
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:10,260
is a man I'd been with for 20 years.

521
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:12,340
After I learned the truth,

522
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:13,500
I questioned him,

523
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:15,940
but he showed no remorse at all.

524
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:18,300
I knew the law

525
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:19,940
could not punish such a person.

526
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:22,260
So I killed him.

527
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:26,640
I want to seek justice
for the innocent lives lost

528
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:27,940
in that fire.

529
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:33,140
The court session just started.

530
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:34,540
No need to be so nervous.

531
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:37,180
I neither prevented Lum Chin
from testifying

532
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:39,380
nor eliminated the risk.

533
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:42,180
That means I have no more value to them.

534
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:46,540
They've abandoned me.

535
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:50,060
It's been over 20 years.

536
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:52,620
You've helped them out countless times.

537
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:55,700
And the more I did,

538
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:57,460
the better I understood their tactics.

539
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:03,500
How did you find out the truth?

540
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:04,680
Hon Fui-lung

541
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:06,500
and the mastermind of the arson

542
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:08,500
had a private conversation.

543
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:09,780
I recorded it.

544
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:12,600
Recording file No. 12

545
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:13,380
[Prosecution]
has been submitted

546
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:14,380
as evidence.

547
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:16,580
Playback is permitted.

548
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:18,600
Back then,

549
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:20,900
thanks to you torching the shantytown,

550
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:23,700
we took a great risk and made a fortune.

551
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:26,220
I never imagined your biggest reward

552
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:27,460
would be falling for her.

553
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:28,620
Drop the nonsense.

554
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:29,500
Get to the point.

555
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:30,460
[Please Keep Quiet]

556
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:32,780
Burning down the shantytown

557
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:35,060
was our ticket
to making that first fortune,

558
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:36,260
which could get us

559
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:39,140
a piece of the old town's
future development.

560
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,660
Soon, we'll be reaping the rewards.

561
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:42,820
And then,

562
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:45,220
we'll retire in comfort.

563
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:46,220
Sounds pretty good, doesn't it?

564
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:47,380

that Tat Ga-ma might have

586
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:17,340
committed suicide out of guilt.

752
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:22,300
You're fine.

753
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:51,620
Dad.

754
00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:52,540
Yat-wai.

755
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:56,180
What's wrong?

756
00:42:56,660 --> 00:42:57,540
Didn't get much rest?

757
00:42:58,500 --> 00:42:59,060
No, it's not that.

758
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:01,300
By the way,

759
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:02,580
I had a dream last night.

760
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:05,180
We were playing baseball together.

761
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:07,020
Really?

762
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:08,620
Then,

763
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:09,860
I'd better start practicing.

764
00:43:10,180 --> 00:43:11,020
Once you're out,

765
00:43:11,020 --> 00:43:11,660
we'll hit the field together.

766
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:12,980
Okay.

767
00:43:14,580 --> 00:43:15,460
Have you been studying?

768
00:43:19,540 --> 00:43:20,780
You'll be out soon.

769
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:22,100
Then,

770
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:24,140
things can go back to how they were.

771
00:43:24,380 --> 00:43:25,620
I'll go to work. You'll go to school.

772
00:43:26,620 --> 00:43:28,140
Maybe you'll even get yourself
a girlfriend.

773
00:43:28,780 --> 00:43:30,100
We'll have time to cook at home

774
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:31,940
or take a trip together.

775
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:35,020
And we'll bring Grandma too.

776
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:37,320
Of course.

778
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:13,340

779

[Chun Yue]

780
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:29,300
[Chun Yue]

781
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:30,620
Thanks for getting Sek Chi-yeung's case

782
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:32,760
overturned.

783
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:35,060
It's what I should do.

784
00:44:37,460 --> 00:44:38,740
As the one who presided over this case,

785
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:40,520
you must know

786
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:43,000
that overturning the finding
that Sek Chi-yeung

787
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:43,840
was a corrupt officer

788
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:45,440
is the same

789
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:48,140
as overturning the killer's confession.

790
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:51,340
The real murderer was a woman

791
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:52,680
who is already serving her sentence.

792
00:44:53,540 --> 00:44:54,860
However, the real killer
in the Hon Gong case

793
00:44:55,940 --> 00:44:56,720
remains at large.

794
00:44:58,060 --> 00:44:58,920
The Regional Crime Unit

795
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:00,740
will be reopening that investigation.

796
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:03,740
When you gave me
the A05 statement earlier,

797
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:06,660
did you expect such an outcome?

798
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:09,740
This is great, actually.

799
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:19,900
Perhaps, as you said before,

800
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:23,140
this is not the final outcome yet.

801
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:43,820
Mr. Chun.

802
00:45:45,460 --> 00:45:47,780
You've rid the police force
of a black sheep,

803
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:49,540
boosting their morale.

804
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:51,360
Social stability and prosperity

805
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:52,640
are conducive to economic development.

806
00:45:53,420 --> 00:45:54,260
There are no reporters here.

807
00:45:54,860 --> 00:45:55,960
You don't have to talk like that.

808
00:45:57,260 --> 00:45:58,700
Mr. Chun, why do you say that?

809
00:45:59,820 --> 00:46:00,960
It's been a pleasure and a triumph

810
00:46:00,980 --> 00:46:02,460
working with you.

811
00:46:04,340 --> 00:46:04,780
Mr. Chun,

812
00:46:05,620 --> 00:46:06,280
you should remember

813
00:46:06,820 --> 00:46:09,000
that I am a member
of the CSD committee.

814
00:46:09,940 --> 00:46:11,140
I just proposed a plan.

815
00:46:11,860 --> 00:46:12,900
It's about encouraging
incarcerated individuals

816
00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:13,860
to be proactive

817
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:14,720
and turn their lives around.

818
00:46:15,140 --> 00:46:16,300
It also includes setting up
a reward system,

819
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:18,400
which would be directly reviewed
by our committee.

820
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:21,020
If they demonstrate good behavior,

821
00:46:21,260 --> 00:46:22,380
their sentences could be reduced,

822
00:46:22,820 --> 00:46:23,620
allowing for early release.

823
00:46:25,460 --> 00:46:25,660
Come on.

824
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:27,100
I won't bother you anymore, Mr. Chun.

825
00:46:34,540 --> 00:46:35,040
Goodbye.

826
00:46:41,380 --> 00:46:42,340
You've been handling

827
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:43,640
some pretty big cases lately.

828
00:46:44,860 --> 00:46:45,820
Look at you. You're losing weight.

829
00:46:46,740 --> 00:46:49,140
You definitely haven't been eating
properly on time.

830
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:52,400
Have you chosen the university

831
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:53,020
Yat-wai will re-attend?

832
00:46:53,420 --> 00:46:54,460
Should we apply ahead of time?

833
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:56,340
No need to rush.

834
00:46:56,740 --> 00:46:58,980
Let him recover after being released

835
00:46:59,460 --> 00:47:01,260
and enroll in the new semester.

836
00:47:01,580 --> 00:47:02,240
Wouldn't that be better?

837
00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:05,200
What if he can get out early?

838
00:47:08,140 --> 00:47:09,100
Is that possible?

839
00:47:11,540 --> 00:47:12,700
I heard about a new policy.

840
00:47:13,340 --> 00:47:14,420
If they behave well,

841
00:47:14,420 --> 00:47:15,140
there's a chance.

842
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:18,020
That's great then.

843
00:47:18,540 --> 00:47:19,600
Yat-wai's always been well-behaved.

844
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:21,260
I'm sure he'll keep it up.

845
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:23,420
He'll definitely get out early.

846
00:47:24,100 --> 00:47:25,180
Next time we see him,

847
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:26,220
let's cheer him up a bit more.

848
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:29,800
Come on.

849
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:30,920
Hurry.

850
00:47:31,060 --> 00:47:31,220
Okay.

851
00:47:31,420 --> 00:47:31,820
Have some more.

852
00:48:01,780 --> 00:48:02,100
Hey.

853
00:48:02,700 --> 00:48:03,860
What if they actually

854
00:48:04,020 --> 00:48:04,780
find it?

855
00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:06,340
It's fine.

856
00:48:07,060 --> 00:48:08,140
They'll just turn a blind eye.

857
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:10,540
Do you guys have to put it here with me?

858
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:13,180
Your dad is the President

859
00:48:13,220 --> 00:48:15,340

861
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:18,300

or the pawn.

00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:27,140
do you really think
I'd be friends with you?

867
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:31,700
Let me tell you something.

868
00:48:32,140 --> 00:48:33,700
As long as your dad plays nice,

869
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:34,780
no one's going to lay a finger on you.

that before we meet the demand,

908
