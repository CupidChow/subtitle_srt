(Fengyuan West City Hospital)
Your depression has become severe,

29
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:09,230
and you're showing significant
cognitive impairment.

30
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:11,550
You need to be admitted
for treatment as soon as possible.

31
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:13,110
Mom,

32
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:16,860
Yinan and I are getting married.

33
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,710
I'm pregnant.

34
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:23,990
Do you have time

35
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:25,430
next week?

36
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:27,820
Let's have dinner together.

37
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:39,110
Are you happy?

38
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:44,580
He is

39
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:46,620
good to me.

40
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:50,860
That's good.

41
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:53,900
Glad to hear that.

42
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:56,900
Mom,

43
00:02:58,070 --> 00:02:59,430
so, about the dinner?

44
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:04,820
Dinner...

45
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:08,670
Next week then.

46
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:11,790
Great!

47
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:16,100
Mom,

48
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:20,620
how have you been?

49
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:23,260
Is he

50
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:25,820
good to you?

51
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:31,100
You're supposed to call him Mr. Lin.

52
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:37,510
How have

Beibei,

58
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:02,820
have you eaten?

59
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:04,620
Yes.

60
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:09,660
Are you

61
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:12,590

62
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:15,430
I'm doing great.

63
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,150

00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:28,230
So,

66
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:29,620
I'll see you

67
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:31,590

68
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,020

00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:56,950
at the old house.

77
00:04:57,710 --> 00:04:59,020
I'll be waiting for you at 3 PM.

78
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:18,260
It's okay.

79
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:20,900
I'm here for you.

80
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:24,780
I'm here for you.

81
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:22,710
Beibei,

82
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:24,340
wash your hands and come out for dinner!

83
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:26,630
Coming!

84
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:31,310
Mom,

85
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:33,340
why did you make
so much delicious food today?

86
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:34,870
You silly girl,

87
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:36,660
you forgot it's your birthday.

88
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:37,710
Oh yeah!

89
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:38,990
It's my birthday.

90
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:40,500
Thanks,

91
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,590
Mom.

92
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:43,500
Look at you,

93
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:44,780
my girl

94
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:46,710
is all grown up

95
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:49,260
and so beautiful.

96
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:51,150
Just like me.

97
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:52,260
Of course!

98
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:52,990
You know,

99
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:54,780
my classmates say I look just like you.

100
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:55,540
Right?

101
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:57,750
Must be good genes.

102
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:58,750
Come on, eat some meat.

103
00:06:58,750 --> 00:06:59,660
Thanks, Mom.

104
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:03,500
It's so good.

105
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:05,780
Have some more.

106
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:07,470
Mom,

107
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:08,940
it's my birthday.

108
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:11,060
Didn't you make noodles?

109
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:14,750
I forgot.

110
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:16,500
I got caught up

111
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,340
making this tomato egg soup.

112
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:19,750
Should I

113
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:21,540
go make you some noodles?

114
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:23,380
No, no,

115
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:23,870
it's fine.

116
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:25,540
The tomato egg soup is delicious.

117
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:31,150
It's so good.

118
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:32,310
Mom,

119
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:33,100
let me feed you.

120
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:37,470
Come on!

121
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:39,030
Bad girl.

122
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:42,780

123
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:44,660
(my daughter,)

124
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:47,380
(as your mother,)

125
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:49,340
(this is my first)

126
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:51,660
(and last letter to you.)

127
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:53,710
(I deeply regret)

128
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:56,660
(that fate made me your mother.)

129
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:59,870
(Because of it, your childhood
and adolescence)

130
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:01,940
(were deprived of a father's
and a mother's love.)

131
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:05,100
(You've suffered unfair judgment)

132
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:07,590
(and slander at such a young age.)

133
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:11,940
(I was young and naive,)

134
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:13,750
(becoming a mother too early,)

135
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,750
(and your father)

136
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:17,380
(abandoned us.)

137
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:19,940
(But I don't hate him.)

138
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:22,380
(Because of him, I got you.

139
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:26,590
(But now, whenever I see you,)

140
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:28,430
(when I see you
throwing everything away)

141
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:29,310
(for love,)

142
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:32,540
(I'm reminded of the unfulfilled
desires I had when I was young.)

143
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:35,340
(All this time,)

144
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:37,190
(I thought)

145
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:38,990
(the only way I could make it up to you)

146
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:40,750
(was by giving you)

147
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:41,780
(a comfortable life.)

148
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:43,780
(But in this moment,)

149
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:45,340
(I realize I was wrong.)

150
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:47,750
(So wrong.)

151
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:50,260
(What I should have given you)

152
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:51,820
(was my full presence,)

153
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,990
(to be your side and
face life's challenges together.)

154
00:08:58,150 --> 00:08:58,940
(Beibei,)

155
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,030
(your face)

156
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:04,340
(is becoming more and
more blurry in my memory.)

157
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:08,340
(I can hardly remember
your beautiful face anymore.)

158
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:12,150
(How I wish I could always
remember you, just as you are.)
