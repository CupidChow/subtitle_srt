my full name is Han Xiaochen,

192
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,220
Xiaochen as in
"smiling at the mortal world."

193
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:55,390
When I was a kid,

194
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:57,510
I was over 200 pounds, a big fat girl.

195
00:09:57,950 --> 00:09:59,630
But my dad, old Han,

196
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:01,270
always told me to smile at the world.

197
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:04,540
Then one day,

198
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:08,020
I met a boy that I liked,

199
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:09,340
really liked.

200
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:11,190
But because I was overweight,

201
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:12,900
he rejected me.

202
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:14,510
I thought

203
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,630
that if I just lost weight,

204
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:17,140
I'd have a chance to be with him.

205
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:20,750
But in the end, here I am,
sitting with you all,

206
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:23,020
facing the Cang Mountain,

207
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:24,220
overlooking Er Lake,

208
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:26,190
talking about love and life,

209
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:27,220
smiling at the world.

210
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:28,630
Well said!

211
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:38,140
