Xiangbei...

20
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:23,700
I'm sorry, Xiangbei.

21
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:28,750
I was wrong.

22
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:38,910
I know you're going
through a sensitive time,

23
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:40,740
and your emotions aren't stable.

24
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:43,000
I shouldn't have argued
with you like that.

25
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:56,870
I'll try harder.

26
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:03,460
Let's not fight anymore, okay?

27
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:06,140
The little one can hear us.

28
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:08,740
It's probably laughing at us.

29
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:11,070
(We just had the most intense argument)

30
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:12,750
(since we first met.)

31
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:14,710

32
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:17,220

00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:20,260

00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:44,030

35
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:45,990

36
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:48,620
(We were married.)

37
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:50,620
I do!

38
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:51,540
I do!

39
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:02,220
(Because of that,)

40
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:05,260
(I happily made a decision)

41
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:06,540
(that I would)

42
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:07,900
(later regret for the rest of my life.

43
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:25,100
Hello, Beibei.

44
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:26,620
Hello, Yinan.

45
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,310
I'll go with you today.

46
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:29,820
Great.

47
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:31,230
I'll pick you up

48
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:32,180
after I finish work,

49
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:32,740
okay?

50
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:33,540
Okay.

51
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:34,510
By the way,

52
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,350
there's a gift box on
the bottom shelf of the closet.

53
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:39,260
There's a dress inside.

54
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:40,540
Try it on and see if it fits.

55
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:44,310
Really?

56
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:46,380
Go check it out.

57
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:47,020
Where is it?

58
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,540
Open the closet and
check the bottom shelf.

59
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:55,510
Mu Yinan,

60
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:57,900
so you had this all planned out!

61
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:00,150
What if I decided not to go?

62
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:02,260
Wouldn't your preparation go to waste?

63
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:03,950
I've had it ready for a while.

64
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:05,540
It's just a dress.

65
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:06,350
I'm glad it made you happy.

66
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:07,310
Everyone!

67
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:08,180
All departments,

68
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:08,950
get ready!

69
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:09,660
Come on!

70
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:10,870
We're going to start shooting.

71
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:11,660
Wait for me

72
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:12,740
to come pick you up later.

73
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:13,710
Okay.

74
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:14,510
See you later.

75
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:53,060
Wanqing!

76
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:55,100
Happy birthday, Wanqing!

77
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:56,310
Happy birthday!

78
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:57,590
Happy birthday!

79
00:05:57,910 --> 00:05:58,780
Thank you!

80
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:00,660
You look stunning today.

81
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:09,910
Wanqing.

82
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:15,630
Happy birthday.

83
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:16,500
Thank you.

84
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,190
Wanqing,

85
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:18,630
happy birthday.

86
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:23,340
You didn't have to.
You're close friends.

87
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:26,100
Xiangbei picked it out just for you.

88
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,500
I hope you'll like it.

89
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:29,940
I love anything from you two.

90
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,710
Wanqing,

91
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:32,750
happy birthday!

92
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,500
You're back, baby!

93
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:38,260
Let's go over there.

94
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:41,060
Want to have some cake?

95
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:41,470
Sure.

96
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:47,580
Are you feeling nauseous again?

97
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:48,820
Who is that girl?

98
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:55,310
Are you okay, Xiangbei?

99
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,430
She's not feeling well.

100
00:06:59,030 --> 00:06:59,820
Where is the restroom?

101
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:01,990
There's a restroom in the room
on the second floor.

102
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:04,260
If she's unwell,

103
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:05,430
she can rest there for a bit.

104
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:06,030
Okay.

105
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:06,660
Thank you.

106
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:07,710
You guys enjoy the party.

107
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,260
Come.

108
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:53,320
Let's get you on bed
to lie down for a while.

109
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:25,380
(Mo Sang)

110
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:29,910
Come.

111
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:31,060
Have some water.

112
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:43,780
(Mo Sang)

113
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:51,540
Are you feeling better?

114
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:54,150
Yes, much better.

115
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:55,500
Are you sure?

116
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:02,470
You should go.

117
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,100
I'm feeling much better.

118
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:07,310
I'll wait here for you.

119
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:08,940
I'm not going anywhere.

120
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:09,940
Okay.

121
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,060
Stay here then.

122
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:13,150
Don't go out.

123
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:22,340
Wait for me.

124
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:25,590
Cheers!

125
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:26,940
This is great.

126
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:30,750
You two make

127
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:31,940
such a fantastic couple onscreen.

128
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:33,590
Perfect match.

129
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:34,780
Keep pairing up

130
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:36,340
in future projects, alright?

131
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:37,750
Don't split up!

132
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:38,940
Yinan,

133
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:40,540
if there's anything
you don't understand,

134
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:41,750
make sure to ask the director
for guidance.

135
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:44,340
And, director, please give them
plenty of direction on set.

136
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:45,020
Leave it to me.

137
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:54,020
