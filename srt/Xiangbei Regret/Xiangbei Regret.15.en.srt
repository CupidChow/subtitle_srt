67
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:11,540
I brought some guests.

00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:11,990
Good.

69
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:13,660
Did you prepare some food?

70
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:16,020
Of course.

71
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:18,100

72
00:04:18,710 --> 00:04:20,230
that's Xiangbei,

73
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:22,260
and that's Li Munan.

74
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:23,990
Hi, grandma.

75
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:25,990
Hi.

76
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:27,540
Let's go in.

77
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:27,900
Come on in.

78
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:28,350
Okay.

79
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:29,180
Come, Grandma.

80
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:31,590
Come on.

81
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:38,950
Grandma,

82
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:40,740
how many times have you soaked

83
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:42,020
the fabric in the vat?

84
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:45,460
Just dried it and put it in.

85
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:47,990
Xiangbei,

86
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:48,950
why don't you

87
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:50,380
keep Grandma company for a while?

88
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:51,710
I'll soak the fabric

89
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:52,460
and hang it out to dry.

90
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:53,900
Tonight, I'll make you
something delicious.

00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:54,900
Lele,

92
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:57,660
but I can't understand Grandma.

93
00:04:57,710 --> 00:04:58,790
Don't worry,

94
00:04:58,790 --> 00:04:59,660
I'm here to help.

95
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:00,820
Right, Grandma?

96
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:01,260
Okay.

97
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:03,310
Lele, how about this,

98
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:05,070
let Grandma teach Xiangbei
how to dye fabric.

99
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:07,150
Great idea!

100
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:09,150
Grandma,

101
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:11,620
you can show Xiangbei
how to tie the knots.

102
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:14,100
Okay. I've been
tying them for days.

103
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:30,590
Xiangbei,

104
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:32,150
come help me wring this.

105
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,710
Okay.

106
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:36,710
Here.

107
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:38,100
Hold this side.

108
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:42,150
Three, two, one, go.

109
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:45,150
Three, two, one, go.

110
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:47,630
Again.

111
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:13,060
What do you think, Xiangbei?

112
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:14,100
Beautiful, right?

113
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:17,540
It's stunning.

114
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:19,940
Xiangbei,

115
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:21,780
sit here and rest.

116
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:23,470
I'll go help Grandma in the kitchen.

117
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:24,340
Okay.

118
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:44,190

00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:08,190
Hello, Mr. Tang.

125
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:09,910
Will Mr. Zhang be available

126
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:11,220
in the next few days?

127
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:12,630
Could I meet up with him?

128
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:14,220
Oh, Mr. Mu.

129
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:16,500
I'm sorry,

130
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:18,260
but Mr. Zhang has been
incredibly busy lately.

131
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:19,540
He doesn't have time to see you.

132
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:21,590
How about this,

133
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:22,430
tell me what you need,

134
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:23,630
and I'll pass the message

135
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:24,430
to him

136
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:25,340
when he's available.

137
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:27,060
That's fine, I will wait.

138
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:28,990
Do you know exactly when he'll be free?

139
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:32,630
I really couldn't say

140
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:34,470
when he'll have time.

141
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:36,190
I'm in the middle of something now.
I have to go.

142
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:36,820
Bye.

143
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:44,710
Mu Yinan again?

144
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:45,780
Yes.

145
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:48,150
He'd like to know
when you could meet him.

146
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:49,540
Ignore him.

147
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:52,990
Mu Yinan and Mo Sang
have been riding high

148
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:54,710
these past couple of years.

149
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:57,030
It's time to bring them down a notch.

150
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,780
I just want to see

151
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:01,660
if they can finish their project
without us.

152
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:03,190
Oh, absolutely.

153
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:05,590
But I'm worried about what
happened in the private room.

154
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:07,590
If they get desperate
and go to the press,

155
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:08,990
it won't be good for the company

156
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:09,990
or for you.

157
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:12,590
Plus, I've heard that
Mu Yinan's ex-girlfriend

158
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:13,710
works in digital media.

159
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:15,060
I'm worried that might...

160
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:16,710
Well, go and take care of it then!

161
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:17,990
I'll take care of it

162
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:19,060
as soon as I get in the car.

163
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:21,470
So, are we still going
to Miss Li's place?

164
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:22,220
Dumb question!

165
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:33,430

166
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:36,340
