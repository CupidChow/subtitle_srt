Xiangbei,

20
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:32,990
are you tired?

21
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:35,190
No,

22
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:37,030
I'm just feeling a little sleepy.

23
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:38,460
Here.

24
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:39,710
Have some water.

25
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:41,390
Okay.

26
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:58,710
How about we get up
and move around?

27
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:00,230
I'll take some photos of you.

28
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:02,190
Let me rest.

29
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:04,350
I'm really sleepy.

30
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:05,940
Come on, get up.

31
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:08,550
You know,

32
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:09,870
Xixi and I set up

33
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:11,150
a photo wall in the shop,

34
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:12,500
but we don't have a picture of you yet.

35
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:13,940
I absolutely

36
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:15,260
have to take

37
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,750
the best photo of you

38
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:18,750
and hang it right in the center.

39
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:19,860
How about that?

40
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:20,860
Come.

41
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:22,540
Get up.

42
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:23,540
Alright.

43
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:24,430
Come.

44
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:26,390
Look at this pomegranate tree,
it's so beautiful,

45
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:27,430
isn't it?

46
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:28,860
Look at the pomegranates.

47
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:30,220
Stay right there.

48
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:31,390
Let me take a few photos of you.

49
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:32,750
Come on,

50
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:34,540
smile a bit more!

51
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:37,990
Try a different pose.

52
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:39,620
How about I help you up there
for better shots?

53
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:41,540
I think you'll look

54
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:43,030
even better up there.

55
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:43,710
Come.

56
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:45,070
Careful.

57
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:17,820
No more photos.

58
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:19,900
I'm really tired.

59
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:20,870
I just want to sit for a while.

60
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:21,990
Alright, alright.

61
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:22,430
Come.

62
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:24,020
Let's go take a break then.

63
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:25,710
Easy.

64
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:29,510
Rest well, okay?

65
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:30,460
Okay.

66
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:17,260
Lele,

67
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:19,900
you have to stay positive.

68
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:22,430
If Xiangbei sees you like this,

69
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:24,460
it'll only make her feel worse.

70
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:29,100
The doctor said

71
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:30,660
there's still hope.

72
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:33,620
We will see a miracle.

73
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:37,180
You have to stay strong.

74
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:40,710
We have to hold onto hope.

75
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:05,990
Li Munan?

76
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:10,460
What's going on with you guys?

77
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:13,950
Nothing.

78
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:14,740
Nothing.

79
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:16,460
Nothing.

80
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:17,460
I was telling him

81
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:18,740
to go buy some soy sauce

82
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:20,350
because we're out of it.

83
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:21,430
Right, Li Munan?

84
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:22,180
Yes, yes.

85
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:24,710
Go!

86
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:25,710
Get the soy sauce.

87
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:26,430
Okay.

88
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:29,260
I'll go.

89
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:31,540
I need

90
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:32,630
a walk

91
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:33,540
and shake off the fatigue.

92
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:35,340
I'll go with you.

93
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:37,060
It's fine.

94
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:39,100
Go and give them a hand

95
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:40,380
in the kitchen.

96
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:17,590
Xiangbei?

97
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:18,710
Xiangbei?

98
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:19,590
Xiangbei?

99
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:20,540
Xiangbei?

100
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:23,260
Xiangbei?

101
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:28,310
Xiangbei?

102
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:30,780
Xiangbei?

103
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:32,630
You'll be fine, Xiangbei.

104
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:53,190
Yinan,

105
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:54,540
I found it.

106
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:59,260
(Drink with me.)

107
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,310
How is it?

108
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,750
Is this evidence favorable?

109
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:06,940
Okay.

110
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:08,260
Let's figure out

111
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:09,500
what we should do about them.

112
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:19,060
Come on.

113
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:19,780
Come on!

114
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:24,710
Don't be impulsive.

115
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:25,940
Zhang Ye!

116
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:27,910
Stop right there!

117
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:31,940
You're in the mood for shopping, huh?

118
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:32,780
Loser!

119
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:34,470
You're useless when I need you.

120
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,710
What is the meaning of this?

121
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:41,820
You just hit me a couple of days ago,

122
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:43,430
and now you're here uninvited.

123
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:44,540
You must be

124
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:46,310
after my money, huh?

125
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:48,150
Tang,

126
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:48,990
call the police!

127
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:50,940
Tell them someone

128
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:51,990
is causing trouble here

129
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:52,940
and get them to come quickly.

130
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:53,910
Go ahead,

131
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:55,220
call them.

132
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:56,500
And be sure to let the police

133
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:57,380
know

134
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:58,540
how you harassed

135
00:07:58,540 --> 00:07:59,940
a public figure in a public place.

136
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:01,780
What...

137
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:02,750
What...

138
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:03,100
What...

139
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:04,340
What do you want?

140
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:07,540
Don't think showing me this video

141
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:08,910
is going to make everything go away.

142
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,540
You're no saints yourselves.

143
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:13,540
Mu Yinan,

144
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:15,430
I've heard all about you.

145
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:17,310
Didn't you get ahead
by mooching off some woman?

146
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,630
Stop pretending like you're any better.

147
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:20,100
You're really asking for it, aren't you?

148
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:21,190
Mo Sang,

149
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:21,940
calm down.

150
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:26,150
The days of sleazy men
thinking they can have it all

151
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:26,910
are over.

152
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:28,310
Don't think waving a little cash around

153
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:28,990
makes you untouchable.

154
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:30,590
Tomorrow,

155
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:31,340
my lawyer will be in touch

156
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:33,820
about your harassment
of our female artist

157
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:35,750
and your unpaid balance.

158
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:45,590
Li Munan,

159
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:48,660
let's take Xiangbei to the hospital now.

160
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:56,470
Say something.

161
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:01,030
She needs to have the will
to keep going.

162
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,100
Given her current condition,

163
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:05,100
she must be hospitalized immediately.

164
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:06,870
There might still be a slim chance.

165
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:08,150
Otherwise,

166
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:09,990
anything could happen at any time.

167
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:11,660
She also

168
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:13,100
needs someone by her side at all times.

169
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:14,660
Most importantly,

170
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:18,780
the patient needs
to have the will to live.

171
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:23,060
If she gives up on herself,

172
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,430
even the best doctor can't save her.

173
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:30,340
Then

174
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:32,750
what can we do to make sure
she has that?
