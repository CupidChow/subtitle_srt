19
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:11,870
Mu Yinan!

20
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:15,300
I saw you shooting an ad

21
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:17,380
at Anxi Lake yesterday.

22
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:19,670
You went to Anxi Lake?

23
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:21,060
Why didn't you tell me?

24
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:23,380
That's the mysterious place
I was telling you about,

25
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:25,670
the one I said was
like paradise on Earth.

26
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:26,700
But

27
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,300
before I could take you there,

28
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:29,670
you beat me to it.

29
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:33,270
That was not cool at all, Mu Yinan.

30
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:34,700
Oh?

31
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:36,510
Are you jealous?

32
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:41,460
I told you, yesterday was just work.

33
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:43,780
And the perfume on Cui Wanqing

34
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:44,990
was overwhelming.

35
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:46,230
Really?

36
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:46,990
Smell it.

37
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:49,070
Really, it's still lingering.

38
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:52,030
But you seemed to enjoy it.

39
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:54,260
All I could think about was,

40
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:55,550
"Hurry up and finish the shoot

41
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:56,900
so I can go home,

42
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:58,830
take a hot shower,

43
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,990
and have you make me a bowl
of tomato and egg noodles.

44
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:03,830
That's all I want in life."

45
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:05,420
I'm not making you noodles.

46
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:17,070
(Actually,)

47
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:19,220
(Cui Wanqing's perfume isn't that bad,)

48
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:21,260
(but a little white lie)

49
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:23,580
(could make Xiangbei happier.)

50
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:28,070
(When Yinan comes home tonight,)

51
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:30,390
(I'll tell him that little secret.)

52
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:32,820
(He probably won't mind)

53
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,670
(this sudden surprise.)

54
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:41,340
(Gynecology Clinic
Attending Doctor: Zhang Wentong)

55
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:46,750
Doctor.

56
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:54,220
The baby is in good condition.

57
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:55,300
You need to rest more.

58
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,540
Why didn't your husband come with you?

59
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:02,260
You have to be extra careful
during the first three months.

60
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:03,690
You need someone to take care of you.

61
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:11,220
Did you hear me?

62
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:13,880
Don't think this isn't a big deal
just because you're young.

63
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:17,510
Okay, I understand.

64
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:20,260
My husband has been really busy lately.

65
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:21,310
Next time.

66
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:23,150
I'll have him come with me next time.

67
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:24,740
Alright, make sure to rest well.

68
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:32,710
Thanks, doctor.

69
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:35,590
Appreciate this.

70
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:36,070
Okay.

71
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:36,870
Bye.

72
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:50,660
Uh,

73
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:52,950
sorry, everyone. Please excuse me.

74
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,970
I'll be right back,
just need to use the restroom.

75
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:56,350
I'll be back soon.

76
00:03:59,020 --> 00:03:59,660
Go ahead.

77
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:01,260
We'll keep drinking and having fun.

78
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:10,460
Careful!

79
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:11,900
I'm okay.

80
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:13,070
I'm okay.

81
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:16,150
Where is Xiangbei?

82
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:33,710
Easy there.

83
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:36,180
Mu Yinan.

84
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:40,510
You're here,

85
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:41,260
Xiangbei.

86
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:42,510
So, you're Xiangbei.

87
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:44,180
I heard a lot about you from Yinan.

88
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:46,990
How did he get so drunk?

89
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:51,020
Where is Mo Sang?

90
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:56,710
Mo Sang...

91
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,790
Let's go home.

92
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:04,660
Okay, give me

93
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:05,230
a minute.

94
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:06,150
Patient.

95
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:08,430
Hello, Mo Sang.

96
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:10,150
I'm outside the room.

97
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:11,430
Come and give me a hand.

98
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:12,230
Hurry up.

99
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:20,950
Stop standing there. Come and help!

100
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:21,790
Okay.

101
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:22,510
Hold this.

102
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:24,220
Are you okay?

103
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:25,340
I...

104
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:25,990
I...

105
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:26,870
Let's go home.

106
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:27,150
Okay.

107
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:27,590
Come on.

108
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:28,380
Let's go home.

109
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:30,590
We're going home.

110
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:31,690
I have to walk him out first.

111
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:32,500
Please wait here.

112
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:51,750
I'm here.

113
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:52,380
Beibei.

114
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:53,910
I'm here.

115
00:05:58,220 --> 00:05:59,470
I'll go get you some water.

116
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,260
I'll go get you some water.

117
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:04,340
Xiangbei.

118
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:16,220
Mu Yinan...

119
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:18,500
Mu Yinan...

120
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:20,910
Mu Yinan...

121
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:24,750
Mu Yinan, stop it!

122
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:25,820
Mu Yinan!

123
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:34,060
Beibei...

124
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:40,060
I'm really exhausted.

125
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:42,190
Let's work hard together, okay?

126
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:46,780
I love you so much.

127
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,710
I know.

128
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:51,780
I know you love me.

129
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:53,710
I want to succeed quickly.

130
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:55,470
I...

131
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:57,540
I have to succeed.

132
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:01,430
I have to succeed,

133
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:02,660
and then

134
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:06,820
I'll give you a home.

135
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:08,310
You will. You will.

136
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:09,500
That day will come.

137
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:11,710
Not a rented place,

138
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:15,220
but a home that belongs
to just the two of us.

139
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:16,380
You will.

140
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:17,500
I know.

141
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:19,260
I know.

142
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:35,470
Thank you for taking me home.

143
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:37,150
Ms. Cui, you're very welcome.

144
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,910
I'm glad you didn't think you've invited
the wolf into your house.

145
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:43,340
That joke wasn't funny at all.

146
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,820
Tell me, how could someone
as ordinary as Xiangbei

147
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:57,870
have stayed by
Yinan's side for so many years?

148
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,100
What does he like about her?

149
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:05,940
When it comes to love, who knows?

150
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:07,310
Anyway,

151
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:09,060
it's getting late, I should get home.

152
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:10,990
By the way,

153
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:12,660
your birthday is coming up
in a few days.

154
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:14,360
You should think about
how you want to celebrate.

155
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:15,660
After all, it's your first birthday

156
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:16,820
since you signed with us.

157
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,150
Let's celebrate here.

158
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:21,030
I'll invite Yinan and Xiangbei over.

159
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:25,780
Okay.

160
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:33,710
Beibei.

161
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,340
Are you okay?

162
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:47,870
Are you upset

163
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:49,470
because I drank yesterday?

164
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,820
(Even though I firmly believe)

165
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:55,990
(that Yinan loves me deeply,)

166
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:58,310
(something about a woman's intuition)

167
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:00,060
(made me check Yinan's phone)

168
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:01,220
(for the first time.)

169
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:03,500
(It's her again.)

170
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:19,470
Don't be mad, okay?

171
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:21,430
I won't drink again.

172
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:32,590
I fell asleep in a daze yesterday

173
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:34,910
and had a dream.

174
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:36,260
I'm pregnant.

175
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:44,830
So, that wasn't a dream?

176
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:47,460
Let's get married.

177
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:53,119
(A promise blurted out
under the influence of alcohol,)

178
00:09:53,119 --> 00:09:56,336
(and the woman who keeps appearing
by his side,)

179
00:09:56,336 --> 00:09:58,300
