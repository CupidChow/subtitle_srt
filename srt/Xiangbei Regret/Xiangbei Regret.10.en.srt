Li Munan,

20
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:30,060
how long have you been
working on this painting?

21
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:31,460
Why does it still look so bad?

22
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:32,670
Look at this.

23
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:34,190
Look at this color scheme.

24
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:35,940
Even I can do better than you.

25
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:52,780
Li Munan,

26
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:53,900
look.

27
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:55,300
That guy,

28
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:56,830
he's standing at the door again.

29
00:01:58,740 --> 00:01:59,710
What's it to you?

30
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:01,300
Mind your own business.

31
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:06,670
Li Munan,

32
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:09,140
are you and Xiangbei

33
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:10,780
hiding something from me?

34
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:19,070
How could Boss
have something to hide from you?

35
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:20,350
Maybe you're just overthinking it, Lele.

36
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:25,390
No, no, no.

37
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,470
My sixth sense tells me

38
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:29,820
there's something going on.

39
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:30,900
Xixi.

40
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:31,390
What?

41
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:31,900
You...

42
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:35,110
Are you two working together?

43
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:35,900
No way.

44
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:36,820
I'm nothing like him.

45
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:37,470
Stop it.

46
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:40,540
You go upstairs and
change the sheets now.

47
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:41,990
Me again?

48
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:42,820
Go!

49
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:44,580
I'm going to interrogate Li Munan.

50
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:54,710
Li Munan!

51
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:56,820
Li Munan,

52
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:58,710
that's so not cool.

53
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:01,860
Now you've got me
feeling like an outsider.

54
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,030
Xiangbei says she doesn't know him,

55
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:05,820
and that's all I know.

56
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:06,500
Maybe

57
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:07,990
you should ask her yourself.

58
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:09,430
Is that so?

59
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:10,900
All right then.

60
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:14,260
You know,

61
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:15,540
we've been here for so long,

62
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:18,020
but we've never heard Xiangbei

63
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:19,710
talk about her past.

64
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:28,150
Li Munan,

65
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:30,620
do you think

66
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:32,540
that person might be

67
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:33,610
Xiangbei's ex-boyfriend

68
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:34,990
or

69
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:37,660
first love or something?

70
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,620
Like, someone who loved her so much

71
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:41,350
that he followed her all the way here?

72
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:43,230
According to your storyline,

73
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:44,540
next Xiangbei's going
to be so touched by him

74
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:47,870
standing there every day

75
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:49,660
that she'll fall for him,

76
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:50,660
and then they'll end up

77
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:52,510
living happily ever after, right?

78
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:53,790
Yes, yes!

79
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:56,540
It's like a total fairy tale!

80
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:58,990
Isn't this basically straight
out of a rom-com?

81
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,100
Li Munan,

82
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:02,590
I never

83
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:04,590
would've guessed you were into

84
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:06,620
those cheesy love stories
that teenage girls love.

85
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:09,590
I'm seeing you in a whole new light...

86
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:11,180
What's your problem?

87
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:12,020
You

88
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:13,790
are hopeless.

89
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:14,380
Now,

90
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:16,710
go help Xixi change the bed sheets.

91
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:18,310
Stop bossing him around all the time.

92
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:21,180
You're no fun.

93
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:43,790
You're here.

94
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:55,020
What would you like?

95
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:56,820
The usual.

96
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:18,790
Mr. Mo,

97
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:21,310
you had me rush over here
early in the morning

98
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:22,150
just to

99
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:23,430
watch you drink?

100
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:29,660
Give it up, Wanqing.

101
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:32,540
It's never going to work out.

102
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:35,990
Mo Sang, you know

103
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:38,380
I'm not someone

104
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:39,750
who gives up easily.

105
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:45,750
Mu Yinan found her.

106
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:05,100
Xiangbei,

107
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:08,630
can we talk?

108
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:12,750
Xiangbei!

109
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:20,710
I've been looking for you
for three years.

110
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:23,660
Can you at least talk to me?

111
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,030
Xiangbei!

112
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:15,100
Xiangbei,

113
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:17,700
how have you been all these years?

114
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:21,660
I'm doing fine.

115
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:24,100
Mu Yinan,

116
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:27,150
go live your own life.

117
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:30,030
Xiangbei,

118
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:33,540
over the years, I've tried everything.

119
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:37,420
I've searched through every city,
contacting freelance photographers,

120
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:40,260
but I couldn't find your name anywhere.

121
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:43,630
I just hoped that one day,
if I found you,

122
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:45,750
I could tell you...

123
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:47,500
Mu Yinan,

124
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:51,220
we were too young back then.

125
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:53,630
My love

126
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:55,990
didn't fit with your life,

127
00:08:57,430 --> 00:08:58,870
and there's no need
to keep holding onto it.

128
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:02,780
From now on,

129
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:06,430
I hope you can forget
those unhappy days

130
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:13,380
and live the life you want.

131
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:23,630
Xiangbei!

132
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:30,710
Xiangbei.

Xiangbei!

Xiangbei?

135

Xiangbei, are you okay?

136
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:49,580
