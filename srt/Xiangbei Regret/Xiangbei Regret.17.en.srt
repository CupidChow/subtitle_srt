00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:11,350
If she gives up on herself,

20
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:15,710
even the best doctor can't save her.

21
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:18,630
Then

22
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:21,020
what can we do to make sure
she has the faith?

00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:29,220
Xiangbei?

00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:30,140
Xiangbei?

Xiangbei?

26
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:33,590
Xiangbei, wake up!

27
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:36,860
I

28
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:39,100
will not marry you.

29
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:48,460
No.

30
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:49,740
No.

31
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:53,710
No.

32
00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:59,190
Xiangbei, wake up!

33
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:00,940
Xiangbei,

34
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:02,670
I'm Lele.

35
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:03,580
Xiangbei?

36
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:04,900
Xiangbei, don't be afraid.

37
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:23,940
Grandma says

38
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:26,620
that when someone has a bad dream,

39
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:29,900
just smooth their brow,
and they'll be okay.

40
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:37,790
Xiangbei?

41
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:39,500
Xiangbei, you're awake!

42
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:47,670
Where am I?

43
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:54,110
Xiangbei,

44
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:56,430
this is my grandma's house.

45
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,620
At noon,

46
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:00,820
you and Li Munan came
with me to visit her.

47
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:03,390
We even dyed
some fabric outside earlier,

48
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:05,070
and then you fell asleep.

49
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:06,750
Right, Li Munan?

50
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:08,300
Yes.

51
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:11,390
Who's watching the inn then?

52
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:12,820
Xixi.

53
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,820
Lele already asked
Mrs. Wang from next door

54
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:15,990
to help keep an eye on things.

55
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:18,870
Xixi?

56
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:21,350
That young man

57
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:23,540
who loves taking pictures?

58
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:26,870
How can we let a guest watch the inn?

59
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,590
Let's go back now.

60
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:29,540
Xiangbei,

61
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:31,150
just lie down and rest.

62
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:32,510
Don't worry,

63
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:34,460
I've got everything at the inn covered.

64
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:35,620
Besides,

65
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:36,660
my grandma

66
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:38,740
made special ham rice just for you.

67
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:40,100
If you leave,

68
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:41,950
what if she gets upset?

69
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:43,870
Okay.

70
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:47,020
Lunch's ready!

71
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:48,430
Come have dinner!

72
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:49,380
Dinner's ready!

73
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:51,100
Xiangbei, let's go

74
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:52,310
and try her delicious ham rice.

75
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:52,900
Come on.

76
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,180
- Let's have dinner, okay?
- Let's go.

77
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:54,820
Okay.

78
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:56,350
Let's get up and eat.

79
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:01,310
Come on, Xiangbei.

80
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:04,350
Sit.

81
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:05,740
Grandma!

82
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:07,260
Grandma!

83
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:09,990
Grandma,

84
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:11,310
sit with Xiangbei.

85
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:12,380
I'll serve the food.

86
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:14,710
There's more in the kitchen.

87
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:17,900
Come on, Li Munan.

88
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:18,660
Give me a hand!

89
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:20,900
So dumb!

90
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:24,710
Grandma,

91
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:25,870
what's your recipe?

92
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:27,870
Here it comes!

93
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:32,020
Here comes the ham rice!

94
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:37,070
Let's eat.

95
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:38,310
- Thank you, Grandma.
- Thank you, Grandma.

96
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:39,590
Thank you, Grandma.

97
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:40,540
Let's eat.

98
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:41,180
Dig in!

99
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:42,460
Let's eat, Xiangbei.

100
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:43,900
Have some dishes.

101
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:45,590
This smells so good!

102
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:46,740
Grandma, have some more.

103
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:47,310
Okay.

104
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:49,150
- Better than your cooking, right?
- Here, have some.

105
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:49,990
Xiangbei, have some meat.

106
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:51,990
It's good, right, Xiangbei?

107
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:52,740
It's better than

108
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:54,230
my tomato and egg noodles.

109
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:55,660
Thanks, Xiangbei.

110
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:00,790
Why did you take my meat?

111
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:01,740
Hey, that's mine!

112
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:03,690
I don't care.

113
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:16,710
Grandma,

114
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:17,950
I'll do the dishes.

115
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:19,230
Go on, go on.

116
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:20,310
Okay.

117
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:27,060
(Mo Xueqin,)

118
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:30,190
(do you miss me?)

119
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:32,340
(I)

120
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:35,940
(miss you so much.)

121
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:38,750
Grandma.

122
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:40,500
- Grandma.
- You have it.

123
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:41,590
Drink it without me.

124
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:43,030
I'm going to bed.

125
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:44,990
I'm going to bed.

126
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:46,470
Grandma.

127
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:47,910
Bye, Grandma.

128
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:48,710
Okay.

129
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:55,470
Xiangbei,

130
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:56,940
how about

131
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,470
we just stay here tonight?

132
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:01,220
It's not safe to bike back in the dark.

133
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:02,190
Besides,

134
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:04,100
I already talked to Xixi

135
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:06,260
and told him to sleep
in the spare room on the first floor.

136
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:07,870
I also asked him to lock up the inn

137
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:09,310
before bed.

138
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:14,060
When Li Munan finishes doing the dishes,

139
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:16,710
we can enjoy a little drink

140
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,540
under the moonlight.

141
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:19,780
Let me tell you,

142
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:20,780
this is

143
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:21,710
osmanthus wine

144
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:23,990
that my grandma made herself.

145
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:25,990
I searched the kitchen forever
to find it!

146
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:27,750
But

147
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:29,780
my alcohol tolerance is low, Lele.

148
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:30,820
That's fine.

149
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:36,430
Just smell it.

150
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:37,540
Doesn't it smell amazing?

151
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:40,060
This wine

152
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:41,630
won't get you drunk.

153
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:43,260
And

154
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:44,220
even if it does,

155
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:46,220
we'll just head straight to bed.

156
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:48,190
Well...

157
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:49,870
just

158
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:51,150
a little bit, then.

159
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:52,340
Just a little.

160
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:54,540
If you wanted more,

161
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:56,660
I wouldn't let you have it anyway.

162
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:05,710
And Li Munan

163
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:07,340
is so slow!

164
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:09,940
Li Munan,

165
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:11,380
are you done?

166
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:13,750
A simple chore is taking you forever.

167
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:14,870
If you don't hurry,

168
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:16,430
we'll have the wine without you!

169
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:18,780
I'm coming!

170
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:19,710
Come, Xiangbei.

171
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:22,310
I even brought the wine glasses.

172
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:24,380
Alright,

173
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:25,630
let's have a drink.

174
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:27,340
Alright.

175
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:28,260
Let me

176
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:29,780
fill your glasses.

177
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:34,380
This

178
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:35,870
is mine.

179
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:41,660
And this

180
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:43,150
is Li Munan's.

181
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:49,540
This

182
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:51,060
is Xiangbei's.

183
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:54,590
I knew it, you're the best,

184
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:56,940
Lele.

185
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:00,750
Cheers!

186
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:01,780
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

187
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:03,820
Cheers!

188
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:12,870
How is it, Xiangbei?

189
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:13,630
Nice, right?

190
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:14,820
Told you, didn't I?

191
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:16,100
It's good.

192
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:19,940
Look.

193
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:21,660
There are so many stars in the sky.

194
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:25,190
With stars this beautiful,

195
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:28,030
I need to be right next to you
to enjoy them,

196
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:29,710
Xiangbei.

197
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:33,190
See

198
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,540
that one?

199
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:38,590
That star

200
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:41,750
is so big, bright, and sparkly.

201
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:43,430
I think

202
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:45,660
it's just like you.

203
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:51,750
Xiangbei,

204
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:53,220
look at that one,

205
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:57,220
see that small, faint one

206
00:08:57,430 --> 00:08:58,910
that doesn't even sparkle?

207
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:01,030
That's definitely Li Munan.

208
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:06,630
Do you think

209
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:09,630
we can watch the stars together
again next year?

210
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:12,260
No, forget next year,

211
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:14,660
will we even get to see them tomorrow?

212
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:16,430
I think

213
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:18,780
not only tomorrow,

214
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:20,590
but also the day after,

215
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:22,660
and the day after that,

216
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:24,310
and for every tomorrow after that.

217
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:25,590
We'll keep watching

218
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:27,910
the stars together,

219
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:28,870
for as

220
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:31,060
many days as we can count!

221
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:32,060
You're right.

222
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:33,470
What matters is

223
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:35,590
that we're watching them together.

224
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:37,750
We definitely will.

225
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:39,540
Now, let's drink!

226
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:40,340
Let's drink!

227
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:41,780
Come on.

228
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:45,190
Lele, you're drinking way too fast.

229
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:47,390
This wine is delicious!

230
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:48,870
My grandma made it herself.

231
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:50,100
You're going to get drunk.

232
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,340
And for Xiangbei...

233
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:52,870
Just a little.

234
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:54,190
A tiny bit.

235
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:56,870
Come on.

236
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:58,580
- Cheers!
