What does morality matter

you have now?

21
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:20,460
Miss Wanqing,

22
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:23,380
what you're doing now

23
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:25,270
is so low-class.

24
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:26,620
Low-class?

25
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:29,700
How can love

26
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:31,830
be described as high or low class?

27
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:35,590
What do you want?

28
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:42,140
I'll trade my management contract

29
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:44,190
for a chance to get closer to Mu Yinan.

30
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:53,740
You asked me

31
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:55,260
what happened last night, right?

32
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:57,550
So, what happened?

33
00:01:58,010 --> 00:01:59,360
Cui Wanqing confessed her love to me.

34
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:02,390
Mu Yinan,

35
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:03,900
wow!

36
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:07,190
So you left without saying goodbye
last night to sleep with her, huh?

37
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:09,390
Knock it off!

38
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:11,390
Am I wrong?

39
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:16,580
I turned her down very clearly.

40
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:17,540
Hang on,

41
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:18,790
why?

42
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:20,180
You know me.

43
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:21,260
What I want is...

44
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:23,500
I just want to work

45
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:25,380
in the entertainment industry

46
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:27,190
without getting involved
in complicated business.

47
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:29,390
Once I've made enough money,

48
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:30,500
I just want to live
a simple life with Xiangbei,

49
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,750
just the two of us, sharing a home,
meals, and four seasons together.

50
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:34,820
Honestly,

51
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:36,790
I really don't want to end up

52
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:38,940
in Cui Wanqing's relationship gossip.

53
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,110
She's a big star.

54
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:43,670
You...

55
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:45,470
Fine, fine.

56
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:47,260
That's an easy dream you have,

57
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:48,790
but have you thought about the fact

58
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:51,070
that she's a rising star?

59
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:52,710
If we turn her down,

60
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:54,860
have you considered the consequences?

61
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,190
Just look at the state of the company
these past few months.

62
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:20,350
Let me tell you,
if the company closes down,

63
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:22,070
will you be able to support your love?

64
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:38,870
Hello, Beibei.

65
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,900
Why did it take you so long to pick up?

66
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:44,180
Could you

67
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:46,230
come home a little earlier today?

68
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:48,150
I need to talk to you about something.

69
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:49,870
Okay.

70
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:52,460
How about I take you out
for dinner tonight?

71
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:55,260
Really?

72
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:57,590
Did something good happen?

73
00:03:57,950 --> 00:03:59,070
You're in such a good mood.

74
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:02,990
Not exactly.

75
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:08,790
I'm in a meeting with Mo Sang.

76
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:10,070
Talk later.

77
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:13,020
Okay...

78
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:31,820
Are you still mad?

79
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:38,430
No.

80
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:42,790
Ms. Cui,

81
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:47,510
Mu Yinan doesn't like pushy,

82
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:49,460
clever women like you.

83
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:53,430
If

84
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:54,620
my rudeness yesterday

85
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:56,020
made you uncomfortable,

86
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,510
I apologize, okay?

87
00:04:58,770 --> 00:04:59,870
You don't need to apologize.

88
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:02,460
No matter what you say,

89
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:04,590
I'm not going to leave Xiangbei.

90
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,260
I respect you,

91
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:09,740
but could you at least stop avoiding me

92
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:11,660
and consider me a friend?

93
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:15,900
After all, we'll have plenty of opportunities
to work together in the future.

94
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:21,740
Okay, I'll try.

95
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:27,870
Let's go.

96
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:29,030
