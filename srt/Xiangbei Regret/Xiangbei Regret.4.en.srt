Don't be mad, okay?

20
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:21,100
I won't drink again.

21
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:31,940
I fell asleep in a daze yesterday

22
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:34,590
and had a dream.

23
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:35,940
I'm pregnant.

24
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:44,510
So, that wasn't a dream?

25
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:47,140
Let's get married.

26
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:06,030
Next month is your birthday.

27
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:10,100
Let's go register our marriage.

28
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:15,820
Okay.

29
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:29,990
It must've been tough for you, Beibei.

30
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,110
Honestly,

31
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:35,900
I should have married you
a long time ago.

32
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:46,820
Ms. Cui,

33
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:48,070
I really appreciate you

34
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:49,880
recommending me for this role
to the director.

35
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:51,990
Of course I would recommend you.

36
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:54,900
And I really like the story.

37
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,220
I've read the novel before.

38
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:57,580
You're definitely a great fit

39
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:58,620
for the female lead.

40
00:02:59,220 --> 00:02:59,940
Absolutely.

41
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,940
You should go back
and read the script too.

42
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:03,990
Then we can discuss our roles in detail.

43
00:03:06,967 --> 00:03:09,490
(The number you have dialed
is temporarily unavailable.)

44
00:03:09,985 --> 00:03:11,010
(Please try again later.)

45
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:15,180
(The morning sickness that's
been making my stomach churn)

46
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:16,790
(is really starting to get to me.)

47
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,510
(After leaving the hospital,)

48
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:22,310
(I have this overwhelming urge
to see Yinan.)

49
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:34,310
Hello, Mo Sang.

50
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:36,660
Where is...

51
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:38,180
Where is Yinan?

52
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:44,230
Text me the address then.

53
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:46,790
Okay.

54
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:18,230
Thank you.

55
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:26,710
I don't want you to leave.

56
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,260
I'll be back soon.

57
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:38,350
Give me a kiss first.

58
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:52,020
Cut!

59
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:53,790
Wanqing, that kiss was a great addition!

60
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:57,100
Wait, director,

61
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,540
this scene shouldn't have a kiss.

62
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:03,100
Excellent!

63
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:05,350
Great acting!

64
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:06,620
Beibei.

65
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,430
What are you doing here?

66
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,660
Didn't I tell you to stay home and rest?

67
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:16,870
If I hadn't come,

68
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:19,870
how would I have witnessed
such an interesting scene?

69
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:22,430
Hang on...

70
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:25,260
Beibei...

71
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:26,870
Beibei...

72
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:27,660
Mu Yinan, Mu Yinan.

73
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:28,430
Mu Yinan.

74
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,750
- You're in the next shot.
- Got it.

75
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:30,060
Beibei!

76
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:30,940
Mu Yinan.

77
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:31,940
Hurry up, come on!

78
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:33,940
Okay.

79
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:48,030
I'm back.

80
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:00,060
What's wrong?

81
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:03,780
Are you upset?

82
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:05,990
Mu Yinan,

83
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:08,590
do you think

84
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:11,990
love will just disappear all of a sudden?

85
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:26,340
What's going on?

86
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:29,340
Why are you so sensitive lately?

87
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:35,910
I'm sensitive?

88
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:38,030
But I understand.

89
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:40,380
You do?

90
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,750
Of course I do.

91
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:44,310
I know at the film set today,

92
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:46,200
- Cui Wanqing suddenly added kissing...
- No, you don't understand.

93
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:51,340
If you really understood,

94
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:55,190
why did you have to go and shoot

95
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:56,500
a romantic movie

96
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,990
with Cui Wanqing when I'm pregnant?

97
00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:00,690
- We already took that project before.
- If you understood,

98
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:03,310
then why are you making me run around

99
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:05,030
like a single mom

100
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:06,260
during my prenatal checkups?

101
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:09,100
Do you know how it feels
every time the doctor asks,

102
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,190
"Where's your husband?"

103
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:12,100
and I have to say, "He's busy"?

104
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:14,260
You're making me

105
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:15,940
feel like I'm losing my mind.

106
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:17,060
Mu Yinan,

107
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:19,590
I'm about to go crazy!

108
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:22,710
I know it's not easy for you.

109
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,500
But the thing is, I don't have a choice.

110
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,190
I can't find the time.

111
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:31,060
I want to give you and the baby

112
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:32,100
a better life.

113
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:35,260
Just think about it,
we can't have the baby

114
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:36,870
and still be living in
this tiny, rundown place.

115
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:38,610
How could we take care
of a child like this?

116
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:40,310
It doesn't mean I don't love you.

117
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:41,660
No,

118
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:43,190
Mu Yinan,

119
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:45,820
that's not it.

120
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,340
This was never what I wanted.

121
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:55,780
Then tell me, if you were me,

122
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:58,310
what was I supposed to do?

123
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:03,380
If you

124
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:04,630
really loved me,

125
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:06,710
you wouldn't

126
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:08,820
keep putting off
registering our marriage.

127
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:17,870
Mu Yinan,

128
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:22,060
you're such a hypocrite.

129
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:25,710
Mo Xiangbei, what's wrong with you?

130
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:29,150
What's wrong with me?

131
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:33,340
No, what is wrong with you?

132
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:39,750
Don't tell me you're oblivious

133
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:41,910
to Cui Wanqing's little moves
over and over again.

134
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:43,060
I've made it clear to her
that I'm not interested in her.

135
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:44,470
How many times have you two

136
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:45,940
secretly gone out drinking together?

137
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,580
I told you, I was with the whole crew.

138
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:48,990
Don't think I don't know anything.

139
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,030
We've never

140
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,380
gone out alone.

141
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,910
And so what if I drink?

142
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:56,870
So you're saying

143
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,310
there's nothing going on between you?

144
00:08:58,340 --> 00:08:59,190
Nothing at all.

145
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,030
Okay.

146
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:07,660
Then whose lipstick

147
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:08,910
is this on your collar?

148
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:15,470
It must've gotten there by accident.

149
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:16,710
How do I know how it got there?

150
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:17,820
Why do you keep assuming

151
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,590
I'm involved with someone else?

152
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:21,710
Since you got pregnant,

153
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:23,260
it's like you've become
a completely different person.

154
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:26,710
I barely recognize you anymore.

155
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:32,380
Fine,

156
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:36,100
then tell me,

157
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:39,020
where were you the night before last?

158
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:40,430
You didn't come home.

159
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:41,390
What were you doing?

160
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:49,510
I was working.

161
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:54,830
Then why didn't you answer your phone?

162
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:59,070
Why didn't you respond to my messages?

163
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:04,990
I only got back to you
a few minutes late.

164
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:05,460
I...

165
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:07,660
A few minutes late...

166
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:09,460
Enough, let's stop fighting.

167
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:11,100
It's all my fault, okay?

168
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:17,460
I'll go outside to cool off.

169
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:18,900
No.

170
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:21,900
You can stay.

171
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:25,430
I'll go.

172
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:26,220
Mo Xiangbei...

173
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:28,460
