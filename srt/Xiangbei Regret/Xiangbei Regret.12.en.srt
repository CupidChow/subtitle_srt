Li Munan, stop it!

23
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:49,300
Li Munan,

24
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:51,460
we have to figure out

25
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:52,870
how to help Xiangbei.

26
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:53,670

What should I do now

29
00:01:58,190 --> 00:02:00,070
with you acting like this?

30
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:02,420
Li Munan,

31
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:03,940
say something.

32
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:05,620
Li Munan...

33
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:11,820
What are we going to do?

34
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,780
(Three months ago)

35
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:50,820
(Regret Inn)

36
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:02,940
Do you have a reservation?

37
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:06,110
No.

38
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:09,180
How did you find us then?

39
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,580
I saw

40
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:12,580
a travel blog online.

41
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:14,790
I came based on
the location listed there.

42
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:16,510
Do you have any specific requests?

43
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:21,460
Just by the seaside is fine.

44
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:23,820
Okay.

45
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:29,310
What's your name?

46
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:30,740
I'm Li Munan.

47
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:31,510
What about you?

48
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:32,950
I'm Mo Xiangbei.

49
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:36,620
Nice to meet you.

50
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:38,430
Likewise.

51
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:38,950
Come on.

52
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:44,060
(Cui Wanqing)

53
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:03,460
Hello, Wanqing.

54
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:04,310
What is it?

55
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:05,990
(Hello, Yinan.)

56
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:07,590
Something happened with Mo Sang.

57
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:08,620
You need to come back right away.

58
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:10,660
(Mo Sang and I were
having dinner with Mr. Zhang.)

59
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:12,100
(And Mr. Zhang)

60
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:13,380
(got inappropriate with me.)

61
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:15,790
Mo Sang hit him.

62
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:18,540
(Mr. Zhang is calling the police)

63
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:19,590
(and pulling the investment.)

64
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:21,740
Mo Sang hit Mr. Zhang?

65
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:24,750
Where is Mo Sang?

66
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:28,500
He's been on the phone.

67
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:30,780
And he's been very worked up.

68
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:31,780
(Please come back.)

69
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:34,030
Okay, I'll right back.

70
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:35,540
Okay,

71
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:36,500
I'll wait for you.

72
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:50,870
Xiangbei,

73
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:53,030
something came up at work.

74
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,190
I have to go back.

75
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:55,990
Wait for me.

76
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:57,710
I'll be back soon.

77
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:00,660
After I take care of the problem,

78
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:03,910
I'll stay with you.

79
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,380
I have some urgent business
and will be gone for a few days.

80
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:53,870
Could you please

81
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:54,750
take care of Xiangbei for me?

82
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:08,310
Xiangbei has always been ours.

83
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:10,500
Taking care of her is my responsibility.

84
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:12,590
Mr. Mu, if you need to leave,

85
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:14,660
please leave.

86
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:15,780
Anyway,

87
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:20,100
I'm really grateful to you both.

88
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:06,910
Zhang Ye called me.

89
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:09,030
He said if you just apologize to him,

90
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:10,380
he won't pull the fund.

91
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:12,910
Apologize?

92
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:15,380
The fault isn't ours,

93
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:15,990
Mu Yinan.

94
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:17,150
Should I have

95
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:18,780
done nothing and let that old pervert

96
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:19,710
harass Wanqing?

97
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:35,540
We've seen all kinds

98
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:37,710
of people along the way.

99
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,470
I'll go.

100
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:46,030
I'll apologize to him.

101
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:46,780
No need.

102
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:48,540
This isn't your fault.

103
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:50,540
Mo Sang, it's not wrong
for you to protect her,

104
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:53,030
but it was wrong

105
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:54,340
to be reckless and hit him.

106
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:56,630
I was reckless?

107
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:57,910
Mu Yinan,

108
00:08:58,340 --> 00:08:59,990
didn't you have
any responsibility in this?

109
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:02,630
Let me ask you,

110
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:03,940
during all this time,

111
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:05,870
did you ever once

112
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:07,190
think about our project?

113
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:08,590
Did you think about

114
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:09,820
the hard work

115
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:11,060
we've put into this career?

116
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:13,990
This movie is supposed
to be our big shift.

117
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,710
Besides, we agreed

118
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:17,780
we'd go together that day.

119
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:19,340
If you hadn't bailed on us,

120
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:21,340
would this even have happened?

121
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:22,630
Mo Sang, we've grown up!

122
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,030
It's time for you to grow up too.

123
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:43,100
Go apologize,

124
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:44,900
just take it as a lesson.

125
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:51,070
Do you think I have no pride?

126
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,750
Have we done

127
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:02,430
anything

128
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:03,990
particularly dignified along the way?

129
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:06,700
Mu Yinan,

130
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:09,430
who do you think is dignified?

131
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:14,430
Did you seriously hit me?

132
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:18,750
Stop it!

133
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:19,870
Stop it,

134
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:20,950
both of you!

135
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:27,220
Are you insane?

136
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:30,100
You actually hit me,

137
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:30,870
