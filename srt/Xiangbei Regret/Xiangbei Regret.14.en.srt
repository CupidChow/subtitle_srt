Mrs. Wang!

Mrs. Wang!

21
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:15,990
Mrs. Wang!

22
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:17,100
What is it?

23
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:17,710
Mrs. Wang,

24
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:18,630
do you have any plans this afternoon?

25
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:19,220
Are you going out?

26
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:19,910
No.

27
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:21,420
Mr. Wang went out.

28
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:22,260
I'm staying to mind the shop.

29
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:24,990
Could you watch our inn too then?

30
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:27,300
The guy staying on the second floor
isn't going out either.

31
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:28,910
If he has any questions,
I'll tell him to ask you.

32
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:29,990
Sure.

33
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:31,060
That's great.

34
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:32,270
Where is Xiangbei?

35
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:33,220
Is she not around?

36
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:35,380
Li Munan and I are taking Xiangbei

37
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:36,910
out for the day!

38
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:38,350
Good for you.

39
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:39,420
Stay safe.

40
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:40,230
We got it.

41
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:41,140
Thanks, Mrs. Wang.

42
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:41,710
No problem.

43
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:42,230
Okay.

44
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:43,030
Just come find me if you need anything.

45
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:43,900
Got it.

46
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:44,510
Bye bye, Mrs. Wang.

47
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:45,190
Bye bye.

48
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:45,620
Bye.

49
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:47,740
Bye bye, Mrs. Wang.

50
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:51,580
Lele,

51
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:53,190
go call Xiangbei.

52
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:57,300
Li Munan,

53
00:01:57,870 --> 00:01:59,460
maybe you should come with me.

54
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:01,550
I'm afraid I...

55
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:04,670
Lele,

56
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:06,260
it's okay.

57
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:08,140
As long as we don't give up,

58
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:10,030
there's hope.

59
00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:11,150
So,

60
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:13,580
don't let her see that you're upset.

61
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:17,500
Come on.

62
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:18,790
Li Munan,

63
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:22,110
I'm scared.

64
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:24,900
It's okay.

65
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:26,470
Today,

66
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:29,030
let's just focus on spending a fun,

67
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:30,540
happy day with Xiangbei.

68
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:33,790
What if she doesn't want to go?

69
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:34,860
If she doesn't want to go,

70
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:36,670
act all cute and throw a tantrum.

71
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:38,350
Figure something out.

72
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:40,260
Come on.

73
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:43,260
Li Munan,

74
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:46,580
I have a question for you.

75
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:49,860
Shoot.

76
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:52,110
You've

77
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:53,990
stayed at the inn for so long.

78
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:57,110
Is it because you like Xiangbei?

79
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:04,580
You don't have to say it. I know.

80
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:05,820
Otherwise,

81
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:07,750
you wouldn't have
stayed here for so long.

82
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:11,150
Let's just go.

83
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:27,590
Xiangbei,

84
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:28,870
it's time to go!

85
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:31,950
Xiangbei,

86
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:33,380
you need to get up and go for a walk.

87
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:34,460
Come on!

88
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:45,660
Xiangbei?

89
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:47,870
Xiangbei?

90
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,150
Xiangbei?

91
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:21,070
Why are you sleeping here?

92
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:26,380
I haven't watched
the sunrise in a long time.

93
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:28,310
I wanted to see it,

94
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:30,620
but

95
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:32,790
I fell asleep

96
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,620
before it came up.

97
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:44,070
Xiangbei,

98
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:45,430
come on, get up and get ready.

99
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:46,990
We're going out today.

100
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:48,100
That's right!

101
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:49,150
Xiangbei,

102
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:50,540
Li Munan and I

103
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:52,590
are taking the day off

104
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:53,740
to take you out.

105
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,620
We've been here for so long,

106
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:56,990
and the three of us

107
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:59,020
have never gone out
and have fun together!

108
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:00,070
When I went home last time,

109
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,230
Grandma kept telling me

110
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:03,460
to bring you back to visit her.

111
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:07,590
You guys go ahead.

112
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:09,020
I'm a little tired.

113
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:10,430
I don't feel like moving.

114
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:12,020
Besides,

115
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:13,380
if guests show up,

116
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:14,310
Xixi

117
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:14,820
might not be able...

118
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:16,350
Don't worry.

119
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:17,510
Xiangbei,

120
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:19,740
I already asked
Mrs. Wang next door for help.

121
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:21,660
If Xixi needs help,

122
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:23,260
she'll step in.

123
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:25,380
And if something still goes wrong,

124
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:26,630
you can dock my pay,

125
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:27,540
okay?

126
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:29,630
Xiangbei,

127
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:31,030
the thing is

128
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:33,870
I already told Grandma you'd come.

129
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:35,260
If you don't,

130
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:38,030
she's going to be upset with me.

131
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:42,060
Exactly.

132
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:42,870
Stop sleeping!

133
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:45,100
If you keep this up,
you'll turn into Sleeping Beauty.

134
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:46,750
That's right.

135
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:47,590
Come on,

136
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:48,190
Xiangbei.

137
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:50,820
Come back with me to see Grandma.

138
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:53,190
Or she'll be mad

139
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:54,540
and won't cook for me tonight.

140
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:55,190
What would I do then?

141
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:56,820
You'd feel bad for me too,

142
00:05:56,910 --> 00:05:57,750
-wouldn't you?
-Alright.

143
00:05:58,590 --> 00:05:59,190
Come on!

144
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,380
Xiangbei,

145
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:30,030
you have so many beautiful clothes!

146
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:32,750
I never see you wear them.

147
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,310
You're not even 30 yet.

148
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:36,340
Stop dressing so dull all the time.

149
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:45,470
Everyone dies eventually.

150
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:46,820
Don't jinx yourself!

151
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:48,430
I shouldn't have said that.

152
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:49,940
Xiangbei,

153
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:51,030
that's not true.

154
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:52,190
We're all

155
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:54,430
going to live long, happy lives.

156
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:08,430
Look at this!

157
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:09,990
Xiangbei,

158
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:11,780
look at this outfit.

159
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:15,990
It's soft and elegant
but with a hint of cuteness.

160
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,310
If you wear this,

161
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:18,310
I promise

162
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:21,190
you'll look amazing.

163
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:23,260
Xiangbei,

164
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:24,660
put this on.

165
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:26,220
I'll grab

166
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,780
my makeup kit

167
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:30,340
and give you a stunning look.

168
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:33,310
When Li Munan and the others see you,

169
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:34,780
they'll be completely blown away!

170
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:37,910
Is that necessary?

171
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:39,630
We're just going
to your grandma's house,

172
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:41,630
not to a matchmaking event.

173
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:44,470
Xiangbei,

174
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:45,870
listen to me.

175
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:49,660
To my grandma,

176
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,940
you've always been

177
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:55,060
this beautiful, graceful fairy.

178
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:58,540
So when we visit,

179
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:00,470
we have to make sure she's wowed.

180
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:03,060
Who knows? She might even go to

181
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:04,660
the most handsome guy
in our village, Peng,

182
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:05,940
and try to set you up!

183
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:09,910
But...

184
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:11,150
No buts!

185
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:12,660
Xiangbei,

186
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:13,820
leave it to me.

187
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:15,030
Don't you trust me?

188
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:17,430
Alright.

189
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:22,660
Now hurry and get changed.

190
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:23,780
I'll be checking

191
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:24,990
when I come back!

192
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:36,590
Then just

193
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:37,430
check the focus.

194
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:38,470
Make sure it's sharp.

195
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:39,710
This button, right?

196
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:40,380
That's the one.

197
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:52,220
Ta-da!

198
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:54,100
Xiangbei's ready!

199
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,590
Am I looking weird?

200
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:08,100
Maybe I should remove the makeup.

201
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:09,660
Not at all.

202
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:12,910
You look really pretty today, Boss.

203
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:21,660
She looks

204
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:23,380
pretty everyday.

205
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,310
Right, right. I misspoke.

206
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:26,500
Go ahead.

207
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:27,060
Okay.

208
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:27,780
When we come back,

209
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:29,260
I'll ask Li Munan to cook you
something delicious.

210
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:29,710
Okay.

211
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:31,430
Let's go then.

212
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:35,150
Where are we going?

213
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:39,140
You guys go without me.

214
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:41,750
I need to stay and watch the inn.

215
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:47,100
Xiangbei,

216
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:48,140
I...

217
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:49,950
I forgot to tell you.

218
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:52,660
I'm taking you and Li Munan home

219
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:53,900
to visit my grandma.

220
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:55,780
Oh, visit your grandma?

221
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:59,510
Who's watching the inn then?

222
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:00,990
Xixi.

223
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:02,830
Xixi has agreed to help. Right?

224
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:04,270
That's right.

225
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,100
Go without worries, Boss.

226
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:05,700
I'll stay here.

227
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:06,310
