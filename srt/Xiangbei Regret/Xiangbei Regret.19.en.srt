00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:09,990
Okay, thank you.

20
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:20,790
Mu Yinan.

21
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:25,830
So you're really set on this?

22
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:27,990
You're just going to leave me
and our company behind?

23
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:37,060
We built this together, step by step,

24
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:39,030
from taking you from a nobody

25
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:40,740
to an influencer,

26
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:41,510
to an artist.

27
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:42,070
And now,

28
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:43,830
we've co-founded

29
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:45,190
this production company.

30
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:46,350
And you're just walking away?

31
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:47,390
Mo Sang,

32
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:50,030
I'm going to see Xiangbei.

33
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:53,420
It's been ten years.

34
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:54,830
We've grown up.

35
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:57,350
We both have things we should do

36
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:58,780
and must do.

37
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:04,300
What if she doesn't forgive you?

38
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:10,070
I'll wait.

39
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:12,430
I'll wait until she does.

40
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:16,540
We were too young before

41
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:17,900
and made so many mistakes.

42
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:21,710
From now on,

43
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:23,710
no matter what she decides,

44
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:26,940
I have no excuse

45
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:28,180
to leave her.

46
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:38,390
Look,

47
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:40,390
I believe in you.

48
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:41,750
You can handle this on your own.

49
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:45,750
Oh,

50
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:46,580
and one more thing,

51
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:49,220
don't repeat my mistakes.

52
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,750
Wanqing is a good woman.

53
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:54,110
Don't let her down.

54
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:13,580
It's good.

55
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:14,260
Try it.

56
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,230
So, you've made up your mind?

57
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:27,380
We have to make up for
the mistakes we made

58
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:28,790
when we were young, don't we?

59
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:30,430
Since you've decided,

60
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:31,790
go then.

61
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:35,900
I wish you happiness.

62
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:38,740
Thank you.

63
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:53,310
So,

64
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:56,020
when are you leaving?

65
00:03:58,210 --> 00:03:59,460
I've booked a flight
for the day after tomorrow.

66
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:02,820
I'll be there soon.

67
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:08,100
Okay.

68
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:12,950
Qiqi.

69
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:24,260
Let's go find Mommy,

70
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:24,950
okay?

71
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:26,540
Okay, Qiqi?

72
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:32,860
(I don't have the courage)

73
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:07,470
Li Munan.

74
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:14,100
I'm craving for

75
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:16,220
some tomato and egg noodles.

76
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:17,590
Okay.

77
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:19,340
Let me finish these last strokes,

78
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:20,940
and I'll go make it for you.

79
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:26,470
Where is Lele?

80
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:29,190
Lele's on the rooftop hanging laundry.

81
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:30,870
She'll be down soon.

82
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:57,220
Li Munan.

83
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,340
I'm almost done.

84
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,470
I'm craving for

85
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:07,430
some tomato and egg noodles.

86
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:20,780
Alright.

87
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:22,820
I'll go make it for you now.

88
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,430
Wait here.

89
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:25,540
It'll be ready soon.

90
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:27,710
Okay.

91
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:11,470
Xiangbei,

92
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:12,750
here are your noodles.

93
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:13,910
Get up and have it.

94
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:16,990
The noodles are ready?

95
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:18,260
Lele, wake Xiangbei up.

96
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:19,290
I'll go cut up some cucumbers.

97
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:23,220
Xiangbei,

98
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:25,590
the noodles are ready.

99
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:27,060
Li Munan made

100
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:29,500
your favourite tomato
and egg noodles again.

101
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:32,870
Xiangbei?

102
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:35,750
Wake up.

103
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:37,100
Get up and have some noodles

104
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:38,910
before it gets cold.

105
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:48,100
Xiangbei?

106
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:51,950
Xiangbei, why are your hands so cold?

107
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:54,900
Xiangbei?

108
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:58,540
Xiangbei, please don't scare me.

109
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:00,750

Please don't scare me, Xiangbei!

115
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:11,220
Xiangbei, wake up!

116
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:13,310
Xiangbei?

117
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:14,310
Xiangbei, wake up!
