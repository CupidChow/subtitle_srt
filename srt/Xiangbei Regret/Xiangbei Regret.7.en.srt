21
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:29,300
Li Munan,

22
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:32,190
how long are you planning to stay here?

23
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:34,700
You've been working on
that painting for three months.

24
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:40,030
Another two or three months,
and I'll be done.

25
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:42,710
Mo Xiangbei,

26
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:45,300
you got such a handsome,
talented artist like me

27
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:46,670
living in your tiny place.

28
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:48,830
Why do you keep trying to kick me out?

29
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:51,990
Besides, I pay the rent on time.

30
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:53,390
Do you not like money?

31
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:56,620
Big artist,

32
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:00,350
Xiangbei likes money,

33
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:01,510
but she doesn't like you!

34
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:02,580
Look,

35
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:04,190
during these three months you're here,

36
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:06,190
you've finished three bags
of rice from the kitchen.

37
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:07,670
The rent you pay

38
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:09,140
doesn't even cover my grocery bill!

39
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:10,670
So what if I ate a few bags of rice?

40
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:12,030
Once I finish this painting,

41
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,260
I'll take you to
the supermarket to buy rice.

42
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:18,070
And besides, Xiangbei hasn't
said anything.

43
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:19,350
It's not like I'm eating your food.

44
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:20,620
Who said that?

45
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:22,540
What's hers is mine too,

46
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:24,150
and I'm part of Regret Inn.

47
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:28,030
I say, big artist,

48
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:30,180
don't just talk about it,

49
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:31,900
go to the supermarket now

50
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:33,260
and bring back ten bags of rice.

51
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:35,850
You better not come up with some
excuse after finishing your painting.

52
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:40,900
I've never met

53
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:45,150
such a stingy rich guy like you!

54
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:48,110
Let go.

55
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:49,150
No!

56
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:49,820
Let go.

57
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:50,430
No, no!

58
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:51,150
Let go!

59
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:55,860
Xiangbei!

60
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:57,500
That's enough, Li Munan.

61
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:58,620
You're a grown-up.

62
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:00,300
Lele here is still a kid.

63
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:01,670
Stop bullying her.

64
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:03,940
Come.

65
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:05,350
Help me change,

66
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:07,110
and I'll

67
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:09,390
take you to the supermarket
to buy rice now.

68
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:10,350
You...

69
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:22,180
How is it?

70
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:23,740
Any news from her yet?

71
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:31,230
Yinan,

72
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:33,660
maybe you should just forget it.

73
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:35,620
I think she really wants

74
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:36,990
to hide from us this time.

75
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:40,820
Keep looking.

76
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:43,070
I have to repay my debt.

77
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:48,230
I can't live my life
with guilt hanging over me.

78
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:50,180
I get it.

79
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:57,260
Don't worry.

80
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:58,380
I know what I'm doing.

81
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:00,870
Okay.

82
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:08,710
The weather is really nice today.

83
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:10,350
Look over there.

84
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:12,870
The weather is nice,

85
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:13,950
but

86
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:15,380
it's nothing like someone here,

87
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:17,540
who promises to carry ten bags of rice,

88
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:19,620
but bringing only a tiny bag out.

89
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:21,430
No idea who's supposed to carry it.

90
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:23,430
Why are you so annoying?

91
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:25,380
You're the one

92
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:26,950
who said you'd carry ten bags!

93
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:28,590
Now look, you've got this tiny bag,

94
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:29,870
and you're making me carry the basket.

95
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:31,710
Look at him, Xiangbei.

96
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:32,900
All right, all right. Don't get upset.

97
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:33,790
This won't do.

98
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:35,180
I have to teach him a lesson!

99
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:38,790
What are you doing?

100
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:40,540
Are you going to hit me again?

101
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:41,540
Yes, I'm going to hit you.

102
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:42,150
Get back here, you!

103
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:42,900
Stop!

104
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:44,590
Get back here!

105
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:46,820
I have to...

106
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,590
- Li Munan...
- Teach you a lesson today!

107
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:51,540
Are you scared now?

108
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:52,310
Are you scared?

109
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:53,820
- Did you just throw me?
- So what if I did?

110
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:54,660
You threw me!

111
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:55,950
Try and throw me too then.

112
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:58,070
Let's see if you can carry me up.

113
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,710
Figure something out for me!

114
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:01,740
- Come on!
- Let me take it.

115
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:03,900
Yinan! Yinan!

116
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:07,230
You're so stupid, Xiangbei.

117
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:09,430
Will you use your head?

118
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,070
I'm so stupid?

119
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:15,710
How am I stupid, Yinan?

120
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:18,020
You...

121
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:19,200
- Are you scared?
- How dare you threw me!

122
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:19,740
Scared now?

123
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:21,540
Try and throw me then.

124
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:23,310
Come on.

125
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,350
You can't carry me up, can you?

126
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:26,940
- You're bullying me.
- Ouch! Ouch!

127
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:29,260
I have to teach you a lesson today.

128
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:30,340
Li Munan!

129
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:30,820
What now?

130
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:31,780
Li Munan! Li Munan!

131
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:33,660
I'm sorry.

132
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,590
- Don't hit me.
- Now you're saying sorry, huh?

133
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:36,990
When you hit me just now...

134
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:42,940
Xiangbei,

135
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:43,910
look over there.

136
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:45,500
It's so beautiful.

137
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:48,310
There's a bird.

138
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:49,310
A bird!

139
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:50,820
It's a seagull.

140
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:51,750
Seagull!

141
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:53,030
I want to go after it!

142
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:55,190
Xiangbei!

143
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:57,340
Xiangbei, look!

144
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:58,430
Look!

145
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,780
It looks like a film crew
is shooting there.

146
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:02,780
Do you think

147
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:04,870
there might be any famous stars?

148
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:06,750
Silly girl,

149
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:08,870
you're like a country bumpkin.

150
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:10,540
Do you really think Xiangbei

151
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:12,030
would be into
such shallow stuff like you?

152
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:14,590
I'm just saying!

153
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:15,870
Dali is such a rare place

154
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:18,260
for a film crew to come to.

155
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,910
Don't you think so,

156
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:21,220
Xiangbei?

157
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:21,870
Exactly.

158
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:24,310
Lele is absolutely right.

159
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:27,500
Country bumpkin.

160
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:29,590
That's enough, Li Munan.

161
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:31,750
Stop talking bad about Lele.

162
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:33,590
She's still a kid.

163
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:34,630
That's right.

164
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:40,190
Do you want to go take a look?

165
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:41,780
I'll have Li Munan take you.

166
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:43,100
No way, I'm not going.

167
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:46,310
As if I wanted to go with you.

168
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:48,910
Let's go, Xiangbei.

169
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:50,260
I'm just saying it.

170
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:51,820
We should head back to
the inn early tonight.

171
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:52,620
Let's go buy rice first.

172
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:53,660

- Okay.

Let's buy rice!

176
