When I saw you,

56

I clung to you like
you were my only hope.

57

58

if what I was offering

was what you needed.

everyone left.

you don't owe me anything.

76
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:46,070
Really.

77
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:01,540
Here, Wanqing.

78
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:02,620
Thank you, Mr. Zhang.

79
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:06,430
Wanqing,

80
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:07,620
you know,

81
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:09,900
the reason we invested in this project

82
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:11,620
is because we believe in

83
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:13,350
your bright future.

84
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:14,460
There

85
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:15,820
aren't many actors

like you anymore.

87
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:23,430
Mr. Zhang,

88
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:24,750
here's the thing,

89
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:25,870
we

90
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:27,150
don't let her drink.

91
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:28,500
We only came here because of you.

92
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,100
Normally, the company has strict rules.

93
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:31,190

00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:31,990
Cheers.

95
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:33,500
Come on, Mr. Mo,

96
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:34,470
you're just pretending.

97
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:36,590
I already heard

98
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:38,430
that both you and Wanqing

99
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:40,540
have quite the tolerance for alcohol.

100
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:41,500
Mr. Zhang,

101
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,340
you're only going by rumors.

102
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:45,710
I'm afraid I really can't
hold my liquor.

103
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:47,940
I'm sure that's not true, Wanqing.

104
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:49,660
I believe in you.

105
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:52,630
Drink with me.

106
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:57,220
Wanqing, let's go.

107
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:01,750
Mr. Mo,

108
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:05,590
it seems like you're trying
to embarrass us.

109
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,630
Don't forget that Mr. Zhang

110
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:09,430
is the one financing this project.

111
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:16,470
Mr. Zhang,

112
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:19,030
the only reason I'm standing here,

113
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:20,820
speaking politely to you,

114
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:22,100
is because

115
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,260
our summer project

116
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:24,380
is about to wrap up.

117
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:25,780
I don't want any problems

118
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:27,190
before that happens.

119
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:28,750
Wanqing is not only one of our artists,

120
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:30,260
she's also the lead actress
of the project.

121
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:32,220
It's my job to protect her,
as her boss and her friend.

122
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:33,590
Don't you agree?

123
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,870
Mr. Zhang, you wouldn't want

124
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:43,500
tomorrow's gossip headlines to be

125
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:44,340
'Cui Wanqing harassed

126
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:45,500

127
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:49,150
I'm pretty sure this room
has security cameras.

128
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:52,910
Don't try to play coy with me!

129
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:54,710
If you don't drink with me,

130
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:55,750
I'll pull the funding tomorrow!

131
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:57,260
You can take your funding and shove it!

132
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:07,750
What are you going to
do about Mr. Zhang?

133
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:09,380
We'll deal with it

134
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:10,500
when it comes.

135
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:12,060
The project is about to wrap up.

136
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:13,220
If the funding falls through...

137
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:18,500
Don't worry, Wanqing.

138
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:20,060
