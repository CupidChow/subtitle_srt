Xiangbei...

20
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:25,300
Xiangbei,

21
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:27,350
I

22
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:28,430
like you

23
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:30,460
so much.

24
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:35,220
We went to the inn together,

25
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:36,750
watched the stars,

26
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:38,300
had hot pot,

27
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:44,190
and tomato and egg noodles.

28
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:49,990
Xiangbei...

29
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:52,710
Xiangbei,

30
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:56,140
I don't want to be apart from you.

31
00:01:57,230 --> 00:01:59,620
You promised me,

32
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:02,830
you can't go back on your word.

33
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:05,100
We

34
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:06,260
still have

35
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:09,550
so many things to do together,

36
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,030
right?

37
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:12,070
Right.

38
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:13,750
We'll

39
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:15,500
always,

40
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:16,790
always

41
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:18,390
be together.

42
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:23,150
I like you.

43
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:27,390
I don't want to be apart from you.

44
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:29,710
We won't be apart.

45
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:33,990
We won't.

46
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:11,900
This place is absolutely gorgeous!

47
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:15,430
Xiangbei, Li Munan,

48
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:16,660
look around!

49
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:19,070
It's so beautiful!

50
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:23,510
Xiangbei?

51
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:24,870
Xiangbei?

52
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:26,590
Xiangbei?

53
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:33,150
She fell asleep again.

54
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:34,790
Let's pull over

55
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:35,870
and wake her up.

56
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:51,260
Xiangbei,

57
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:52,180
wake up.

58
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:54,380
There's a field of flowers up ahead.

59
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:55,740
It's so stunning.

60
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:57,990
Let me take you to see them.

61
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,510
Did I fall asleep again?

62
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:05,790
Let's go take a look.

63
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,620
Or we would've brought Xixi's camera

64
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:08,660
for nothing.

65
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:09,820
Okay.

66
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:12,020
Come on.

67
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:20,310
Let's go.

68
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:32,310
Xiangbei,

69
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:33,990
it's beautiful, right?

70
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:34,950
Yes.

71
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:36,430
Let me tell you,

72
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:38,590
every year, so many people come here

73
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:39,990
to make wishes.

74
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:41,590
In the Bai culture,

75
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:43,950
we've believed in animism

76
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:46,460
since we were kids.

77
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:51,150
Everything in nature, mountains,
water, trees, flowers, has a spirit.

78
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:53,710
You know,

79
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:54,870
this is

80
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:55,950
the kind of place

81
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:57,740
where the nature

82
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:59,230
responds to your calling.

83
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:02,990
Every flower, every tree,
is its own world.

84
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:07,230
Xiangbei,

85
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,870
the flower field is just over there.

86
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:09,820
Let's go!

87
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:10,740
Okay.

88
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:15,590
It's so beautiful, Xiangbei!

89
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,540
Let's go see the flowers.

90
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:18,900
Look,

91
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:19,740
there's a dragonfly.

92
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:21,430
It's a dragonfly!

93
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:23,630
Xiangbei!

94
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:25,750
Xiangbei, let's go over there.

95
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:29,710
Let's go chase the dragonfly!

96
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:33,540
Oh, my God, Xiangbei!

97
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:35,030
Come here!

98
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:36,150
Look there.

99
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:42,910
It's so beautiful!

100
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:44,540
Xiangbei.

101
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:44,910
Come on.

102
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:46,060
I'll take a picture of you.

103
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:47,470
Xiangbei,

104
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:48,750
I'll take a picture of you.

105
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:50,030
This place is so beautiful.

106
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:51,030
Let's take it right here.

107
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:52,220
Let's take a picture.

108
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:53,750
Stand right here

109
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:54,340
like this.

110
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:54,660
Ready?

111
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:56,690
Does it look good?

112
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:58,380
Let's see.

113
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:02,190
Three, two, one.

114
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:06,630
- So pretty!
- So pretty!

115
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:07,630
Now, you two together.

116
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:08,870
Take a picture of us together.

117
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:12,260
Three, two, one.

118
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:14,780
Let's record a video.

119
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:15,430
Sure, sure.

120
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:16,150
Xiangbei,

121
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:17,660
let's record a video together.

122
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:18,940
And we'll shout,

123
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:20,780
"I'm the prettiest girl,"

124
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:21,470
okay?

125
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:22,220
Okay.

126
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:23,060
- Okay.
- Here we go.

127

two,

one.

130
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:28,910
- I'm the prettiest girl!
- I'm the prettiest girl!

131
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:33,260
This place is stunning, Xiangbei.

132
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:35,190
Let's go over there.

133
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:36,990
Look, there are more flowers over there.

134
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:38,030

Xiangbei,

143
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:16,750
come on.

144
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:19,060
Let's go catch some dragonflies.

145
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:22,310
I'll pass, Lele.

146
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:24,190
I'm a little tired.

147
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:25,750
I'd like to sit down and rest.

148
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:26,710
Okay.

149
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:27,910
There's a bench here.

150
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:29,500
Let's take a break.

151
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:30,150
Okay.

152
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:31,820
Lele.

153
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:34,480
Why don't you go buy
two bottles of water?

154
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:36,380
I don't think

155
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:37,940
they sell water here...

156
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:54,500
Xiangbei,

157
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:57,100
let's go to the hospital.

158
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:00,750
You have Lele and I.

159
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:03,590
We will always be there for you.

160
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:06,590
So,

161
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:09,060
will you

162
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:10,940
please not give up?

163
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:14,310
Please, go to the hospital.

164
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:18,590
But

165
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:21,060
I'm running out of time.

166
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:24,710
Lately, I've been dreaming of them.

167
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:27,820
They all miss me so much.

168
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:29,710
No,

169
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,380
it's not too late.

170
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:33,500
I've talked to the doctor.

171
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:35,630
Xiangbei,

172
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:38,380
we still have a long,
long journey ahead of us.

173
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:41,310
Don't leave Lele and me behind.

174
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:48,590
Please,

175
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:51,540
go to the hospital.

176
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:56,870
Li Munan,

177
00:08:58,030 --> 00:08:58,940
your life

178
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:01,060
still has a long way to go.

179
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:04,190
Don't waste your time on me.

180
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,380
I don't see it as a waste.

181
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:16,500
Xiangbei,

182
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:21,470
will you tell me your story?

183
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:26,590
I once had love,

184
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:29,910
but then

185
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:32,750
I gave up on myself,

186
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:37,540
and on love altogether.

187
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:44,660
Xiangbei,

188
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:48,830
do you have any regrets?

189
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:54,220
I think

190
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:57,190
all I have left

191
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:00,660
are regrets.

192
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:31,900
Mr. Mu,

193
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,190
are you sure about this?

194
