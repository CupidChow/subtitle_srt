00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:01,750
Cheer up,

73
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:03,870
or Xiangbei

74
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:05,430
will feel bad.

75
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:15,060

Xiangbei,

84
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:14,780
why are you sitting here
when you're supposed

85
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:16,030
to rest in bed?

86
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:18,430
You might catch a cold!

87
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:34,910
Xiangbei,

88
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:37,220
let's go downstairs for dinner.

89
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:38,540

00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:39,940
Li Munan made

91
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:42,630
your favorite tomato and egg noodles!

92
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:45,710
He wouldn't even make it for me,

93
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:47,260
no matter how much I begged him before.

94
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:48,630
Come eat with us.

95
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:52,940

97
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:56,630

101
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:03,940
You've been

102
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:06,380

121
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:50,060

122
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:52,430
Xixi?

123
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:54,220
He's probably resting upstairs.

124
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:55,940
When I went upstairs to find you,

125
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:56,750
he was there.

126
00:08:58,190 --> 00:08:59,260
Here it is!

Come on, eat up.

130
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:09,990
What are you staring at?

131
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:10,780
Yours is still in the pot.

132
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:11,710
Go serve yourself.

133
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:14,540
Xiangbei,

134
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:15,310
look at him!

135
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:16,220
Li Munan

136
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:18,430
is bullying me again!

137
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:20,710
Li Munan,

138
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:22,430
stop picking on Lele.

139
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:23,260
That's right.

140
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:25,430
Listen up, Li Munan.

141
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:27,540
You'd better do as Xiangbei says,

142
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:28,150
or

143
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:29,100
one day

144
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:29,820

in the kitchen.

154
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:48,950
No, I didn't.

155
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:51,460
You're denying it?

156
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:52,780
When I was in the kitchen,

157
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:54,750
I clearly heard you bad-mouthing me
to Xiangbei!

158
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:55,340
Alright then,

159
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:56,580
what exactly did I say?

160
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:57,390
You...

161
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:58,140

you...

164
00:09:59,190 --> 00:09:59,750
You're framing me.

165
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:01,310
You always make me get my own food.

166
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:01,830

167
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:02,630
Stop, stop.
