(At the ends of the universe,)

23
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:23,940
(the human soul)

24
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:26,670
(will ultimately be its own entity.)

25
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:30,380
(No one can, in the name of love,)

00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:31,780

29
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:42,140

30
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:43,550
(When I was a teenager,)

31
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:45,550
(just as I was once again)

32
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:47,070
(cornered by a senior in an alley,)

33
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:49,330
(he stood against the light)

34
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:51,460
(and showed up in my life.)

35
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:55,350
(He calmed all my fear)

36
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:56,670
(and unease.)

37
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:01,100
(I like Mo Xiangbei so much.)

38
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:02,260
(Listen up, brat!)

39
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:03,590
(When my father was deep in debt)

40
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:04,300
(and I was...)

41
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:04,930
Mu Zhen owes me money.

42
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:05,990
(Cornered by creditors...)

43
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:06,690
You have ten days.

44
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:08,350
If you can't pay it off by then,
I'll break one of your legs!

45
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:09,460
(It was Mo Xiangbei)

46
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:11,300
(who stole her mother's money)

47
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:13,110
(to help me in my time of need.)

48
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:16,710
Mo Xiangbei, that was
a large sum of money!

49
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:17,790
(When I felt lost...)

50
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:18,940
I did not provide for you...

51
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:20,350
(She was always there by my side.)

52
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:22,900
Just so you could take the money
and give it to another man!

53
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:24,900
(He often seems to look down on me,)

54
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:27,490
(criticizing me for not
being smart enough,)

55
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:28,940
(but he's never once)

56
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:30,180
(asked me to leave him.)

57
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:31,220
(I think)

58
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:32,940
(I'll always love him.)

59
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:34,990
(I wanted to give my girl)

60
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:36,670
(a better future,)

61
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:39,580
(until)

62
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:41,390
(I started keeping secret from her)

63
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:44,180
(for the first time.)

64
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:54,900
Don't move.

65
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:57,900
Ms. Cui,

66
00:02:58,470 --> 00:02:59,430
are you drunk?

67
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:07,350
Can I like you?

68
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:11,860
Sorry,

69
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:12,990
my girlfriend...

70
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,590
Don't rush to answer me.

71
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:18,790
You're probably still drunk.

72
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:36,740
I've got my eye on you.

73
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:38,430
You can't escape from me.

74
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:48,510
Sorry, Ms. Cui.

75
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:50,350
My relationship is stable.

76
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:52,460
I do not intend to cheat on her.

77
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:57,870
Mu Yinan?

78
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:00,460
Mu Yinan!

79
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:05,990
But I don't want your apology.

80
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:15,950
Mo Sang,

81
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:17,510
what are you doing over there?

82
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:19,310
Hiding from the drinks?

83
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:20,260
That won't do.

84
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,310
How long has it been since
we last saw each other?

85
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:22,430
We've got to drink up today!

86
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:32,620
Ms. Cui, please have some self-respect.

87
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:34,990
How about having
a couple of drinks with me?

88
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:36,510
Think of it as comforting me

89
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:38,070
after turning me down.

90
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:50,700
(What are the symptoms
in the first 7 days of pregnancy?)

91
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:14,590
Yinan,

92
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:17,070
be honest with me,

93
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:19,460
have you been fooling around outside?

94
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:23,630
I'm not used with you acting like this.

95
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:33,190
Yinan?

96
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:35,380
Yinan?

97
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:39,220
I'm here.

98
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:46,780
Beibei,

99
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:51,060
do you regret meeting me?

100
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:53,470
No.

101
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:58,030
We've been through so much together.

102
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:02,590
You were the first one
to stand up and protect me.

103
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:08,150
The first time I saw you,

104
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:09,340
I thought to myself

105
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:12,750
that I'd hold on to you tightly.

106
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:16,590
Mu Yinan?

107
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:18,630
I'm here.

108
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:25,630
Mu Yinan,

109
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:29,150
Mo Xueqin doesn't want me anymore,

110
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:31,540
you can't abandon me too.

111
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:36,060
You silly,

112
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:38,190
what are you talking about?

113
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:44,540
Yinan,

114
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:47,590
do you like kids?

115
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:49,340
Let's have a baby.

116
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:54,540
Let's wait a little longer.

117
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:56,940
Let the company

118
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,190
get through this tough time first,

119
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:00,340
okay?

120
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:06,710
Okay.

123
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:09,870
Ms. Cui,

124
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:13,630
I suppose you didn't come

125
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:15,310
to my little company

126
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:17,100
just to chat, did you?

127
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,030
Then what do you think

128
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:23,310
I came here for, Mr. Mo?

129
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:27,290
Let's get straight to the point.

130
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:32,660
Mu Yinan

131
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:34,100
has a girlfriend,

132
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:37,470
but what you don't know is

133
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:39,030
that his girlfriend

134
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:40,820
is my cousin.

135
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,150
Do you think I would ruin

136
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:45,060
my own cousin's relationship?

137
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:47,060
That'd be so immoral.

138
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:53,990
Mo Sang,

139
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:56,310
if you hadn't set up your cousin,

140
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:57,710
how could she have

141
00:08:57,710 --> 00:08:58,990
ended up being just a housewife

142
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:01,470
