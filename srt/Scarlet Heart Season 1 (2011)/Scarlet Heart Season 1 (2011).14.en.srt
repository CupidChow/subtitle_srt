00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,570
♫  In the blink of an eye, a thought of stubborn persistence  ♫

3
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:24,000
♫  We were destined to seek our doom like moths flying towards the flame  ♫

4
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:30,480
♫  Knowing that it’d be a disaster, why am I still at a loss about what to do  ♫

5
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,600
♫  The best is not to see, the best is not to miss you  ♫

6
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:43,730
♫  Only like this can I not be in love with you  ♫

7
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:47,050
♫  Just another brushing of the shoulder, and from then...♫

8
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:53,280
♫  I’ll keep falling deeper and deeper in love with you  ♫

9
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:57,960
♫  It’s the mistake of time,  ♫

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,390
♫  forcing us to pass each other by  ♫

11
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:05,360
♫  How I miss you, how far you are  ♫

12
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:07,700
♫  Even though I’d known it’d only result in pain,  ♫

13
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:11,270
♫  at this moment, I still don’t want to escape  ♫

14
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:15,850
♫  Pity these words are too glaring, they hurt the eyes  ♫

15
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:21,330
♫  Two worlds later ♫

16
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:24,980
♫  Don’t want to escape  ♫

17
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:27,450
♫  It’s the mistake of time,  ♫

18
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:30,220
♫  we can only pass each other by  ♫

19
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:34,730
♫  The magnitude of me missing you is as much as how far you are   ♫

20
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:41,000
♫  Even though I know the ending is a mistake that I cannot oppose  ♫

21
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:46,220
♫  Staying in this moment  ♫

22
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:54,610
♫  We can only accept that the feelings run deep, but fate is shallow  ♫

23
00:01:56,980 --> 00:02:02,100
Scarlet Heart
Episode 14

24
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,180
When did you arrive?

25
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:24,560
I just arrived, not long ago.

26
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,380
I saw that you were focused on drawing,

27
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:27,540
and didn't dare to disturb,

28
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:28,940
and didn't greet you.

29
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:30,060
Is anything the matter?

30
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:32,500
Nothing, I was just bored

31
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,020
so I came here to find you for tea and to chat.

32
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:35,740
Previously, I'd only known that

33
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:37,240
Fourth Brother's calligraphy is outstanding.

34
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,220
Only today did I find out that

35
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:40,060
you're good at doing detailed work too.

36
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:45,100
Come and take a look at the painting on this snuff bottle.

37
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:47,080
I don't have such good eyesight.

38
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,220
Tell me!

39
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:54,980
These three little dogs...

40
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:56,780
These two spotted dogs

41
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:58,700
are so fierce looking.

42
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:01,120
On the left side, this curly-haired little white dog,

43
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,140
although it's been drawn in a cute and interesting way,

44
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:04,980
it's obviously a proud dog,

45
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:06,820
and doesn't bow down to wicked authorities.

46
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:08,260
Fourth Brother's painting...

47
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:09,780
does it have some implied meaning?

48
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,860
I feel that one should be like this little white dog,

49
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,060
facing challenges without fear.

50
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:17,260
That's what you call character.

51
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,260
True.

52
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,280
Tell me, what flaws are there?

53
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,260
None, there are no flaws.

54
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,560
If you insist on me finding a flaw,

55
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,080
I can only say that

56
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:32,260
this little white dog

57
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:35,360
is drawn a little too cute.

58
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,600
Really?

59
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:39,420
Am I wrong?

60
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:57,100
Jiejie, why did you leave the door open?

61
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:03,060
Jiejie, do you feel better?

62
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:04,380
After soaking in hot water,

63
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:05,740
the chill in me is gone now,

64
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:07,380
but my nose is still a little blocked.

65
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:09,340
Why not send for the imperial physician to have a look?

66
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:10,900
No need to be so troublesome.

67
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:13,220
A little rain won't kill me.

68
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:15,700
I have always taken good care of myself,

69
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:16,940
and have always been in good health.

70
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:19,220
Take more care next time.

71
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:20,460
I brought some food.

72
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:24,340
Yu Tan, to have you worrying about me,

73
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:25,979
it really makes me feel apologetic.

74
00:04:25,979 --> 00:04:27,740
Jiejie, don't say that.

75
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:28,860
We're good sisters (bosom friends).

76
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,780
Just now, when you sat there motionless, staring listlessly into the air,

77
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:32,300
I thought that you must have been feeling terrible.

78
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,820
I was just thinking of some matters just now,

79
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:36,900
and got carried away in my thoughts.

80
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,300
What were you thinking about?

81
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:42,160
Thinking about the story of Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai again?

82
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,940
It's the next chapter of the story.

83
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:45,840
Next chapter?

84
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,820
I was thinking, if Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai

85
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,500
didn't die,

86
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,980
and even managed to get married...

87
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:53,940
That's great! I, too, think that

88
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:55,780
that should be the ending.

89
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:57,520
I'm not done yet.

90
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,140
They've gotten married, but the price is that

91
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:02,020
Zhu Yingtai has to share her husband

92
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:03,380
with other women.

93
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:05,540
That's not a big deal either.

94
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:08,480
It's good as long as they're able to stay by each other's side for the rest of their lives.

95
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,960
But fighting and getting jealous over a man all the time...

96
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:14,460
Do you think that Zhu Yingtai and Liang Shanbo

97
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:16,720
will still be able to support each other in times of hardship until old age?

98
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,700
Who is it?

99
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:24,140
Greetings to Miss Ruoxi.

100
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,060
Rise.

101
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:27,780
I'm here to deliver something to you.

102
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:30,360
I don't lack anything.

103
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:32,540
You can take it back.

104
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:33,860
Miss, your nose is a little blocked,

105
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:36,500
pinch some snuff to sniff, and when you sneeze, you'll feel better.

106
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:41,740
Here.

107
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,760
Jiejie.

108
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,360
This object is really very exquisite.

109
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,580
The little dogs on it are so vivid and realistic,

110
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:09,820
they really are cute.

111
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:11,920
Jiejie, take a look too.

112
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:28,900
Jiejie?

113
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,040
Double-layered crystal,

114
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,060
three curly-haired dogs fighting

115
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:37,000
with such realistic and funny expressions,

116
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,660
it really is pretty interesting.

117
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:44,220
He's actually comparing us to dogs?

118
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:46,260
Comparing us to dogs?

119
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:47,820
What do you mean?

120
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:50,860
Isn't there always internal strife in the palace?

121
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:53,500
That's true.

122
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:58,940
Why did Fourth Prince give you a snuff bottle?

123
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:00,980
When I was soaked by the rain,

124
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:02,540
he saw me.

125
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:05,740
I'm guessing, he's afraid that I've fallen ill and can't serve His Majesty;

126
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:07,740
that's why he sent this over.

127
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:11,060
Who knows if this actually works.

128
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:12,540
Then why don't you give it a try?

129
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:15,380
Me?

130
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:24,140
Jiejie, it's pretty effective.

131
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:25,140
You try it out too!

132
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:26,700
I'll put it away first,

133
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:28,020
- and leave it for you to use the next time.
- Try it!

134
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:29,740
- Just try once!
- I'm not using it!

135
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,140
Try it!

136
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:32,420
I don't want! I don't want!

137
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:35,860
- Try it! Try it!
- Stop!

138
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:38,340
I'm putting it away.

139
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:40,060
Jiejie, don't run away!

140
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:52,940
Today's weather is lovely.

141
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:54,220
Coming outside to enjoy the flowers

142
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:55,360
is a truly enjoyable thing.

143
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,040
Imperial Father, are you tired from walking?

144
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,620
Do you want to rest for a bit?

145
00:07:58,620 --> 00:07:59,300
No need, no need.

146
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:00,580
Imperial Father is in high spirits right now.

147
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:01,900
Your Majesty, the autumn wind is cool and refreshing,

148
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,640
but it's easy to catch a cold from it.

149
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,240
Why not put on a change of clothes first,

150
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,940
before enjoying the flowers with the princes?

151
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:08,060
How does that sound?

152
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:13,700
That's good too. Let's go.

153
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:18,680
All right then,

154
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,960
let's continue enjoying the flowers.

155
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,160
Let's go.

156
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:24,740
Crown Prince,

157
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:27,460
- Brothers, sit.
- Please sit.

158
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:32,600
Why is Imperial Father

159
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,940
in such a good mood today?

160
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:36,360
Inviting everyone to enjoy the flowers and have tea together.

161
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,320
Usually, Imperial Father is busy dealing with a myriad of affairs;

162
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,580
he needs to enjoy time with the family too.

163
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:41,700
Well said!

164
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,560
It's rare that us brothers gather together,

165
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:45,940
I hope that everyone enjoys the day.

166
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:49,440
Eighth Brother, I see that your chess skills have improved.

167
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,940
How about we have a match?

168
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:53,860
Sure.

169
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:01,300
If only those princes

170
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:02,980
could always get along so well,

171
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:04,100
how nice that would be.

172
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:18,660
Look at you guys, even a small dog can frighten you so!

173
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:32,540
Your servant deserves to die! Your servant deserves to die!

174
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:33,980
How can you be so careless!

175
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:35,260
I'll take the dog away at once.

176
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:41,460
Eighth Brother, continue.

177
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,220
Is it really so funny?

178
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:52,580
I'm not like it at all!

179
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:58,100
Rise.

180
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:00,420
Today is your lucky day.

181
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:01,500
If you don't take more care,

182
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,240
it could be a severe beating the next time.

183
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,920
Let's not talk about whether or not you can withstand the beating first,

184
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,160
even if you are able to withstand it.

185
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,620
Come then, who will take care of you while you recover from your injuries?

186
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:08,940
I will keep it in mind.

187
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,420
Go then.

188
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:23,980
Ruoxi!

189
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,300
Greetings to Fourteenth Prince.

190
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:30,120
What's going on between you and Eighth Brother?

191
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:36,660
I asked him why he still won't go ask Imperial Father for a marriage decree,

192
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,760
but he won't answer me. And when I ask you,

193
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,100
you too won't say anything.

194
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:43,120
What exactly happened that I don't know of?

195
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:47,740
And today, I see you making sheep's eyes with Fourth Brother.

196
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:49,480
What exactly is going on?

197
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:53,120
Fourteenth Prince,

198
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,380
although you've already married several wives,

199
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:56,980
with regards to the matters between men and women,

200
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:59,300
how much do you really know?

201
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:00,920
About the matter between Eighth Prince and me,

202
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,100
don't stick you hands into it anymore.

203
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,180
As for Fourth Prince and me,

204
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:06,700
no matter how I explain it,

205
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,240
you won't listen to me.

206
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,580
You can think whatever you like, I won't stop you.

207
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:14,960
Your servant takes her leave.

208
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,800
Maertai Ruoxi!

209
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:20,580
I hope you won't let Eighth Brother down.

210
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:13,800
I've sounded out my father.

211
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:19,480
He tells me to rest assured.

212
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,000
No matter what,

213
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,760
I'm still his daughter,

214
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,640
you're still his son-in-law.

215
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,340
He won't let us suffer.

216
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:29,640
Minghui, you don't need

217
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,080
to do anything else for me.

218
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,760
You've already done enough.

219
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,120
Why?

220
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:36,940
What I want

221
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:39,940
is the you whom I first got to know.

222
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,900
Back then, I could, with great focus,

223
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,800
do what I wanted to do.

224
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,400
I will do that. As long as you're willing,

225
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:51,100
I'm willing to do anything for you.

226
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:26,540
Chanting scriptures all day...

227
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:28,600
Don't you have enough fortune already?

228
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:33,180
Greetings to Jiejie.

229
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:34,740
Don't try this act on me!

230
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,940
Bei'le might be tricked by you,

231
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:39,020
but don't forget,

232
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:40,780
I'm a woman as well.

233
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,500
The tricks you're playing,

234
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,760
would I not know?

235
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,920
Jiejie, I'm not.

236
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:51,320
Stop trying to play innocent with me!

237
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:54,420
Are you not even willing to give me that last ounce of respect?

238
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:56,040
Jiejie,

239
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,260
I'm not disrespecting you.

240
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:01,420
If you call me Jiejie with any sincerity at all,

241
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:04,940
then don't play me for a fool.

242
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:08,460
What exactly do you want?

243
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:11,300
Tell me honestly.

244
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:13,900
What do I want?

245
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:15,600
What else do you still want to snatch?

246
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,680
What else do you still want? Just say it.

247
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,060
Nothing.

248
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:22,340
Say it.

249
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:24,620
Truly nothing.

250
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:26,240
Say it!

251
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,660
Truly nothing at all.

252
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:30,440
Do you think

253
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:32,860
that you're the only innocent one?

254
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:36,460
How much freedom do I have?

255
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,100
I'm the same as you.

256
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:43,040
Our fates are determined by others.

257
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:49,200
I've never once thought

258
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,260
to snatch Bei'le away.

259
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:52,760
Not for a single moment.

260
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:57,260
Every day, I hide away, copying scriptures and praying.

261
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:01,280
Unless this is the way to steal a man's heart?

262
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:09,060
I chant scriptures, in hope that everyone can live together in harmony.

263
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:15,740
But I really don't know what I should do for you.

264
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:20,020
Let Ruoxi marry Bei'le.

265
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:24,660
Actually, recently Bei'le seems to have

266
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:27,100
met with a lot of worrying matters.

267
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:31,060
I have no more ways to cheer him up anymore.

268
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:35,060
Now, the only thing that can make him happy

269
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:38,620
is for Ruoxi to marry into the family.

270
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:42,100
Actually, I've already known for a long time

271
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:44,740
that Bei'le has fallen for Ruoxi.

272
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:51,500
Are you really willing?

273
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,940
What do you think?

274
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:07,380
A man's destiny

275
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:11,020
is a woman's destiny.

276
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:15,780
You should understand what I mean.

277
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:45,820
Goddess of Mercy,

278
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:47,800
please give your blessing and protection to Ruoxi,

279
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:52,740
that everything will be smooth-sailing, and she'll be healthy and well.

280
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:13,580
Bei'le.

281
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:15,100
Continue praying.

282
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:18,779
Is my presence here disturbing you?

283
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,659
No.

284
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:26,180
This place makes me feel at ease.

285
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:29,460
I'd like to borrow your place to sit for a while.

286
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:36,380
Bei'le,

287
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:37,920
this place is yours as well.

288
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:52,600
Bei'le,

289
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,520
do you have a lot of worrying matters recently?

290
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,640
Nothing in particular.

291
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,320
Then Ruoxi,

292
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:01,800
can she help ease your worries?

293
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:05,660
Why would you bring her up?

294
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:08,140
I want to know what your intentions are.

295
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,440
Bei'le,

296
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:15,280
sooner or later Ruoxi has to get married.

297
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,980
If it is a bad marriage,

298
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,960
then I'll have let Father and Mother down.

299
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,620
If she marries you,

300
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:25,700
I know for certain

301
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:28,600
that you will treat her very well.

302
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,560
But I need to know

303
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:34,300
what your intentions are.

304
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,460
Jiejie, Mistress Liang is looking for you.

305
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:48,160
Mistress Liang?

306
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,260
Do you know if there are any urgent matters?

307
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:53,360
It seems that the flower designs you drew the last time were pretty

308
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,840
so she wants you to draw some more.

309
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:57,420
Got it.

310
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,700
Ruoxi.

311
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:05,500
Jiejie!

312
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:08,300
It's because of Concubine Liang

313
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:09,580
that I'm able to come here.

314
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:10,740
I already guessed it was so.

315
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,360
Sit.

316
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,820
I came today

317
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:22,300
to ask you a question on behalf of Bei'le.

318
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:26,180
Are you willing to marry him?

319
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:31,620
Do you like him?

320
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:33,240
Jiejie.

321
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:36,060
You've known Bei'le for so many years.

322
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:37,400
You know

323
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:40,600
that he treats his wives and concubines very well.

324
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:45,260
Besides, the two of us will be able to meet up often

325
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:47,620
and be each other's companions.

326
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:49,920
Jiejie, don't you mind?

327
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,160
Which prince

328
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,000
doesn't have multiple wives and concubines?

329
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,071
No to mention that with regards to such matters,

330
00:19:56,071 --> 00:19:57,940
I'm indifferent.

331
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,820
If you truly like him,

332
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:05,640
then don't worry so much.

333
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,100
If...

334
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:11,260
if it were that general instead,

335
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:13,780
would you still agree

336
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:17,400
to him taking another wife?

337
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,600
I don't know.

338
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:25,020
But as long as it's good for him,

339
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:27,220
I think I would have agreed.

340
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:30,540
Because I believe that

341
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:32,740
even if he has someone else

342
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:37,260
he would still treat me very well.

343
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:49,540
Ruoxi, you should take time to consider this.

344
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:55,700
Cheers!

345
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:11,460
Meimei, which man doesn't have multiple wives and concubines?

346
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:13,500
It's fine as long as he loves you.

347
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:16,560
Where do all those strange concerns come from?

348
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:21,720
Besides, having many wives and many children is a sign of fortune.

349
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:29,550
♫  On the next page, the farewell penned by you,  ♫

350
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:34,760
♫  it was not up to me to refuse  ♫

351
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:41,970
♫  We’ve walked down this path too hastily  ♫

352
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:49,210
♫  Embracing desires that weren’t realistic  ♫

353
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:55,610
♫  Not in time, wasn’t able to wait long enough to look back and admire  ♫

354
00:21:55,610 --> 00:22:00,880
♫  The fragrance of magnolia is unable to hide wounds  ♫

355
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:07,320
♫  No longer looking for the sunlight peeking through the clouds  ♫

356
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:13,910
♫  No longer looking for the paradise that we promised each other  ♫

359

For the last time,

360
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:01,620
can you agree to my request?

361
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:08,020
Tell me the answer.

362
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:11,400
I want you to tell me with your own lips.

363
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:14,300
Do you agree or not?

364
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:16,140
Ruoxi, why?

365
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:18,420
Why must you force me?

366
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:20,600
Why do you demand that I

367
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,640
choose between two things

368
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,080
that I can in fact have simultaneously?

369
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:26,300
I only want to ask you,

370
00:23:27,071 --> 00:23:29,260
do you agree or not?

371
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:39,900
You don't agree?

372
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:50,820
You need to keep your guard against Fourth Prince.

373
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:54,060
What are you saying?

374
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:58,548
And Wu Sidao, Wang Keduo,

375
00:23:58,548 --> 00:24:04,240
Nian Gengyao, Tian Jingwen, and Li Wei.

376
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,420
You also need to be more cautious with them.

377
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:11,340
From now on,

378
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:15,180
you and I shall have nothing more to do with each other.

379
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,020
Ruoxi!

380
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:27,180
I am a person who is afraid to die,

381
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:28,600
not worth holding onto.

382
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:36,550
♫  No longer looking for the paradise that we promised each other  ♫

383
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:43,060
♫  No longer sighing, you once said that life is unpredictable  ♫

384
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:49,500
♫  The three inches of sunlight that I was unable to borrow  ♫

385
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:58,110
♫  That paradise is the place where I’d loved you  ♫

386
00:25:13,047 --> 00:25:14,180
Who's this?

387
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:15,860
Why is she lying in the snow?

388
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:18,680
Ruoxi! Hurry and get up.

389
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,200
What happened?

390
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,580
Come on.

391
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:23,560
What happened? Did you fall and injure yourself?

392
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:25,260
Take me back.

393
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:28,558
Here. Get up first.

394
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:33,780
Can you walk on this foot?

395
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:37,565
Then I'll carry you on my back. Here.

396
00:25:37,565 --> 00:25:38,460
Wait.

397
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:41,300
It's better that we go back and call someone to take her back.

398
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:43,100
What kind of logic is it for a prince to carry a maid on his back?

399
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:44,942
If word gets out, who knows what they'll say.

400
00:25:45,624 --> 00:25:47,540
That's right. I didn't think about that.

401
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:48,880
Wait here for a moment.

402
00:26:35,422 --> 00:26:36,820
Don't cry anymore.

403
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:40,080
If you really want to shame yourself,

404
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:42,142
it's best you shut yourself in your room to do it.

405
00:26:42,931 --> 00:26:44,046
Once you come outside,

406
00:26:44,046 --> 00:26:45,917
not only is it likely that someone will interrupt you,

407
00:26:45,917 --> 00:26:47,620
you also won't be able to do it to your heart's content.

408
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:58,140
Do you really want to keep sitting?

409
00:27:06,824 --> 00:27:08,378
Look at yourself.

410
00:27:08,378 --> 00:27:10,189
Who would still behave chivalrously to you?

411
00:27:13,953 --> 00:27:15,739
I was just gone for a while, why are you sitting on the ground again?

412
00:27:15,739 --> 00:27:17,622
Come, come. Quickly.

413
00:27:17,622 --> 00:27:19,000
Let me help you up.

414
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,687
Hurry! Hurry! Come.

415
00:27:20,687 --> 00:27:21,755
Yes.

416
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:26,933
Slowly. Slowly.

417
00:27:28,022 --> 00:27:30,480
Hurry and bring Miss Ruoxi back to the palace

418
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,280
and let the doctor check on her.

419
00:27:49,313 --> 00:27:53,128
Yu Tan, did anything special happen in the palace?

420
00:27:53,128 --> 00:27:57,630
Nothing. I only heard that Eighth Prince caught a cold while he was outside and couldn't attend court.

421
00:28:04,921 --> 00:28:06,700
Caught a cold outside...

422
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:09,936
Was it because he got frozen in the snow that day?

423
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:13,240
Is it severe?

424
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:15,060
Ruoxi!

425
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:23,980
Why?!

426
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,160
Let go of me.

427
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,340
You're so apathetic.

428
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:29,420
Don't you feel any heartache?

429
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:31,100
Or is it you don't even have a heart?!

430
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:34,700
It hurts. Let go.

431
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:36,360
You still feel pain?

432
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:37,300
Then will my actions

433
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:38,860
allow you to know other people's pain?

434
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:40,840
The pain of having loved and lost.

435
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,800
It'd be better if you never loved before.

436
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,140
Since you knew this would happen,

437
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:45,580
then why did you agree in the first place?!

438
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:47,660
Who are you playing with?

439
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:48,740
Are you so cruel?

440
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:50,140
Or are you merely wanton?

441
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:53,400
Let go of me, don't you hear me?

442
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,840
I'm telling you to let go of me!

443
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:57,140
Who are you to stick your hands into my matters?

444
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:58,520
Who am I?

445
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:00,540
Today, let's state everything clearly.

446
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:02,780
If you have a good reason, we'll talk further.

447
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:04,000
If you don't have any good reasons,

448
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,720
then I really want to see

449
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,680
whether or not I can stick my hands into your matters today!

450
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:12,260
Let go, let go, let go!

451
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:13,660
Fourteenth Brother.

452
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:15,860
I say, what show

453
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:17,360
are you two acting out?

454
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:20,940
Looks like we came at the right time.

455
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:25,020
Fourteenth Brother,

456
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:26,780
we just came from Mother's.

457
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:28,220
She misses you a lot.

458
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:29,700
If there's nothing you need to do,

459
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:31,500
why don't you pay her a visit?

460
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:38,460
In a few days, I'll come and see you again.

461
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:50,400
Greetings to Fourth Prince. Greetings to Thirteenth Prince.

462
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,280
As it's inconvenient for my legs to move,

463
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,900
I'm unable to serve tea to you two.

464
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:55,900
I hope that you'll excuse me.

465
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:57,740
It's fine. Now,

466
00:29:57,740 --> 00:30:00,200
if you could only explain to us

467
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,980
what this show was all about,

468
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:03,420
we'll forgive you.

469
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:10,180
Fine, fine.

470
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,880
I won't ask about this matter anymore, all right?

471
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,960
If Fourteenth Brother is bothering you,

472
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:17,760
speak out.

473
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:20,640
Perhaps I can help resolve it for you.

474
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,180
It's no big deal.

475
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:28,060
It was just a small argument we got into.

476
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:29,260
You know as well,

477
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:30,780
we've always fought like this since young.

478
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:32,100
It'll be fine in a couple of days.

479
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:35,420
If you're not willing to talk about it anymore,

480
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:36,860
we won't press you either.

481
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:39,260
But Ruoxi, if there's a problem,

482
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:40,740
don't just keep it bottled up inside.

483
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:41,940
If you can say it, say it.

484
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:43,940
I might not be able to fix your problem,

485
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:46,060
but at least I can help ease your worries or think of possible solutions, things like that.

486
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:48,580
If that still doesn't work, go tell your brother-in-law.

487
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:51,220
Although Fourteenth Brother is as stubborn as an ox,

488
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:53,260
he always listens to Eighth Brother.

489
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:00,820
I'm afraid that the villain (Fourteenth Brother) will lodge a complain first.

490
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:02,620
I should just save myself the trouble.

491
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,940
Thanks for coming to see me.

492
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:07,420
And I also need to thank you for the last time.

493
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:10,500
Why are we still being so courteous?

494
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:11,820
How's your foot injury now?

495
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:13,540
The imperial physician said that I hurt my tendons,

496
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:14,780
but it's not too serious.

497
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:16,700
I just need to rest for a few days and I'll be fine.

498
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:20,320
Let's go.

499
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:25,580
Thirteenth Prince!

500
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,080
I'll go back first.

501
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:31,300
Wait a moment.

502
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:33,500
Normally, I don't hide anything

503
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:34,740
from my Fourth Brother. Speak.

504
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:37,420
This time, while on the expedition with His Majesty,

505
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:39,380
I saw Princess Minmin.

506
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:44,020
Say,

507
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:46,420
this reversal of roles is occurring too fast, isn't it?

508
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:48,560
Just one short moment, and it's my turn to act out a show,

509
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:49,980
and both your turns to be the audience.

510
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:52,260
Fine.

511
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:56,620
Tell me. Isn't it just this small matter?

512
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:59,200
Is it necessary for both of you to keep nagging me about it?

513
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:03,380
Even if no one's said it, you should also know about Minmin's feelings for you.

514
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:04,660
Then what about you?

515
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:06,180
She's openly declared them to you?

516
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,620
There are plenty of good men on the plains;

517
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:11,220
there's no need for her to waste time and effort on me.

518
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,580
Minmin is a pretty good...

519
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:17,100
Ruoxi, you're a smart person.

520
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:18,840
Even if she were a goddess,

521
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:20,220
if she doesn't move my heart,

522
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:22,100
why is there need to persuade any more?

523
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:31,100
Although it isn't a serious injury, (make sure you recover completely,) don't leave behind any lingering injury.

524
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:47,220
It's the Lunar New Year again.

525
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:50,020
Even though my leg isn't fully healed,

526
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:51,940
I have no more sorrows or happiness to talk of.

527
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:54,500
I'm just whiling away the days.

528
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:02,780
So cold!

529
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:07,660
Aren't you on duty to serve His Majesty today?

530
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:10,100
How come you're back before the banquet has ended?

531
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:12,460
I especially asked Eunuch Li to let Qiu Chen take my place.

532
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:14,540
She wanted to attend the festivities anyway.

533
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,680
Every year, during the New Year's Eve banquet,

534
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:19,180
the attending servants will always receive rewards,

535
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:21,740
and also get the chance to see people and events that they don't normally get to see.

536
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:22,980
This is a desirable task.

537
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:24,000
It doesn't matter.

538
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,660
I was afraid that you'd be bored alone.

539
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:29,540
Good Luck pouch

540
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:34,160
It's nothing much for me to stay by myself.

541
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:36,100
Why did you ask Eunuch Li for a favor for such a matter,

542
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:37,980
and owe him a favor for nothing?

543
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:40,380
I prepared some delicious food.

544
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:43,680
Tonight, let's eat and drink while talking to each other,

545
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,940
and have a good New Year.

546
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:49,300
It's more fun and relaxed than serving people, isn't it?

547
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:54,220
Come.

548
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:05,940
Did my sister enter the palace today?

549
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:07,420
And Bei'le as well?

550
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:10,020
But Bei'le looked rather dull-spirited.

551
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:12,260
It's probably because he just recovered from a major bout of illness,

552
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:14,220
his face looked rather pale.

553
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:19,920
Jiejie, slow down.

554
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:21,540
It's all right.

555
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,339
Ruoxi,

556
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:47,180
I've thought it through.

557
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:48,859
If there's no you,

558
00:34:48,859 --> 00:34:51,940
then everything else is meaningless to me.

559
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:53,880
Really?

560
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:18,060
Would this count as a New Year's present from heaven?

561
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:23,040
But if Eighth Prince gave up fighting for the throne for my sake,

562
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:26,920
then will history be rewritten?

563
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:28,960
If history really gets rewritten,

564
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,820
then would I even have been born?

565
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:34,580
Would I vanish while in the arms of Eighth Prince?

566
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:36,280
In the end,

567
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:39,380
would we still be able to be together?

568
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:12,940
Happy New Year! Hang a New Year couplet!

569
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:15,180
Happy New Year! Hang a New Year couplet!

570
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:27,620
Today is the first day of the Lunar New Year

571
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:30,140
and I'm already going to do something inauspicious.

572
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:32,280
Originally, I was planning to do it after the Lunar New Year,

573
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:34,260
but I'm afraid that if I continue delaying it,

574
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:36,820
I'll lose the courage to do it again.

575
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:44,860
Fourth Prince,

576
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:47,660
your servant has already made the decision

577
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:49,020
that in this lifetime,

578
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:51,420
I will not marry.

579
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:53,500
I just want to live a solitary life of a Buddhist,

580
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:55,820
chanting scriptures and praying for good fortune for my mother.

581
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:58,700
I beg for your understanding.

582
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:32,540
Greetings to Miss Ruoxi.

583
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:33,700
Please rise.

584
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:37,220
Please wait a moment.

585
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:39,000
I have some things that I need to trouble you to help me deliver back.

586
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,400
All right.

587
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:04,620
Sorry to trouble you.

588
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:06,900
It's no trouble. It's no trouble.

589
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:10,100
From now on,

590
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:12,380
I have nothing more to do with Eighth Prince.

591
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:15,740
From now on, we have nothing more to do with each other.

592
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,820
It's good that Xiaoshunzi isn't coming too.

593
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:34,520
With Fourth Prince ending his pursuit,

594
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:38,180
from now on, everything will be quiet and peaceful.

595
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:42,580
Who is it?

596
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:45,380
It's Xiaoshunzi. I'm here to make a delivery.

597
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:47,820
Come in.

598
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:50,780
I'm here to deliver this to you.

599
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:54,380
If there's nothing else, I'll take my leave.

600
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:55,540
Eunuch,

601
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:56,820
please wait a moment.

602
00:38:56,820 --> 00:38:57,820
Sure.

603
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:14,100
Eunuch,

604
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:15,540
please help me deliver this.

605
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:17,020
Miss, rest assured.

606
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:27,320
It's a new year; everything has passed.

607
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:29,660
New year, new start!

608
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:34,580
Mount Wutai?

609
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:36,620
It's been many years since I last went there.

610
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:39,040
I wonder if it's changed.

611
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:41,280
Last time when we travelled to Mount Wutai,

612
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,660
you hadn't entered the palace yet, right?

613
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:44,100
That's correct.

614
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:46,260
I entered the palace in the 44th year.

615
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:47,860
It's a pity that I was a few years late.

616
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:51,320
This time, she had better come along.

617
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:53,320
Your Majesty,

618
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:56,040
because I was feeling unwell the previous period,

619
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:57,380
I've been on a leave of absence.

620
00:40:57,380 --> 00:40:59,140
Although I'm mostly recovered now,

621
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:00,460
when we are traveling outside the palace,

622
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:02,660
there are already fewer servants attending than there are in the palace.

623
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:04,640
I'm still afraid that I might not be able to serve well,

624
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:06,480
so I specially asked Eunuch Li

625
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:08,900
to find other capable people.

626
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:10,940
You've been ill for so long. Look,

627
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:13,180
even your clothes are hanging loosely on you.

628
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:15,660
Very well,

629
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:17,940
you may stay in the palace this time.

630
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:19,900
Thank you for your kindness, your Majesty.

631
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:24,780
Reporting to your Majesty, Eighth Prince has arrived.

632
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:26,940
Send him in.

633
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:27,700
Yes.

634
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:29,540
You are dismissed.

635
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:27,320
Maertai Ruoxi,

636
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:29,420
is this the ending that you wanted?

637
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,260
Jiejie,

638
00:42:58,260 --> 00:42:59,700
what are you doing here?

639
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:02,480
It was Concubine Liang who helped me come here.

640
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:04,680
If not because I had no choice,

641
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:06,980
I wouldn't want to disturb her either.

642
00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:08,960
Is there anything the matter?

643
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:12,900
Come.

644
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:18,580
I'm worried about you.

645
00:43:18,580 --> 00:43:20,680
My heart isn't at ease

646
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:22,740
so I came to see you.

647
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:30,420
Did you reject Bei'le?

648
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:42,440
Perhaps, you might have rejected a man who

649
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:45,360
could have taken care of you for the rest of your life.

650
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:47,820
But this is your life and happiness,

651
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:52,000
so no matter what choice you make,

652
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:55,820
I'll support you.

653
00:43:57,220 --> 00:43:58,780
Do you still feel so sad?

654
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:06,980
Greetings to Eighth Prince.

655
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:09,040
Dispense with the formalities.

656
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:15,100
You look well.

657
00:45:15,100 --> 00:45:16,540
Jiejie came to see me

658
00:45:16,540 --> 00:45:19,280
so my heart is much more at ease.

659
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:21,500
It seems that way for you as well,

660
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:25,020
like you've gotten over it and let go.

661
00:45:27,380 --> 00:45:30,500
Or it could be that the glory of Mount Wutai

662
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:33,340
has allowed me to forget about secular matters.

663
00:45:36,620 --> 00:45:40,060
After I came back, I was too busy too,

664
00:45:40,060 --> 00:45:42,580
I didn't have time to think too much.

665
00:45:42,580 --> 00:45:43,720
I see.

666
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:50,580
Fourteenth Brother won't go to bother you again.

667
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:55,340
The words you said before,

668
00:45:55,340 --> 00:45:57,320
what do they mean?

669
00:45:57,320 --> 00:46:01,360
Long Keduo, Nian Gengyao, Li Wei, I vaguely understand.

670
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:04,580
But Wu Sidao, Tian Jingwen,

671
00:46:04,580 --> 00:46:06,460
I don't understand those.

672
00:46:06,460 --> 00:46:09,880
By Fourth Prince's side, is there an advisor who has problems walking,

673
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:11,300
named Wu Sidao?

674
00:46:12,260 --> 00:46:13,660
There isn't.

675
00:46:13,660 --> 00:46:16,840
Could it be that I've been misled by television dramas?

676
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:20,540
While there isn't a Tian Jingwen in court,

677
00:46:20,540 --> 00:46:23,180
there is a man named Tian Wenjing.

678
00:46:23,860 --> 00:46:25,340
It must be him then.

679
00:46:25,340 --> 00:46:27,020
I must have remembered wrongly.

680
00:46:29,060 --> 00:46:31,500
All these unrelated people and matters,

681
00:46:32,140 --> 00:46:34,180
what's your explanation for them?

682
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:36,580
Just be more cautious is all.

683
00:46:36,580 --> 00:46:38,380
As for how to explain,

684
00:46:39,140 --> 00:46:41,140
I don't know how to explain it to you either.

685
00:46:41,980 --> 00:46:43,460
If Eighth Prince has no other instructions,

686
00:46:43,460 --> 00:46:45,460
I still have other matters to attend to.

687
00:47:05,020 --> 00:47:09,750
♫  Stopping here, afraid to go any further ♫

688
00:47:10,700 --> 00:47:15,930
♫  So sorrow will be unable to make an appearance  ♫

689
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:22,780
♫  On the next page, the farewell penned by you,  ♫

690
00:47:23,750 --> 00:47:29,070
♫  it was not up to me to refuse  ♫

691
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:35,610
♫  We’ve walked down this path too hastily  ♫

692
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:42,520
♫  Embracing desires that weren’t realistic  ♫

693
00:47:43,420 --> 00:47:48,560
♫  Not in time, wasn’t able to wait long enough to look back and admire  ♫

694
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:54,210
♫  The fragrance of magnolia is unable to hide wounds  ♫

695
00:47:55,080 --> 00:48:00,900
♫  No longer looking for the sun’s rays peeking through the clouds  ♫

696
00:48:00,970 --> 00:48:07,310
♫  No longer looking for the paradise that we promised each other  ♫

697
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:14,080
♫  No longer sighing, you once said that life is unpredictable  ♫

698
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:22,870
♫  The three inches of sunlight that I was unable to borrow  ♫

699
00:48:24,270 --> 00:48:30,290
♫  No longer looking for the sunlight peeking through the clouds  ♫

700
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:36,890
♫  No longer looking for the paradise that we promised each other  ♫
