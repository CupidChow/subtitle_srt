♫  In the blink of an eye, a thought of stubborn persistence  ♫

3
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:24,280
♫  We were destined to seek our doom like moths flying towards the flame  ♫

♫  Only like this can I not be in love with you  ♫

7
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:47,900
♫  Just another brushing of the shoulder, and from then...♫

8

♫  I’ll keep falling deeper and deeper in love with you  ♫

Scarlet Heart
Episode 21

24
00:02:03,279 --> 00:02:04,447
Imperial Father,

25
00:02:04,447 --> 00:02:06,722
Although 13th Brother made a big mistake,

26
00:02:06,722 --> 00:02:08,394
he is still your son

27
00:02:08,394 --> 00:02:10,205
and my brother.

28
00:02:10,205 --> 00:02:11,924
Although his mother died when he was young,

29
00:02:11,924 --> 00:02:14,106
he has always been respectful and caring toward you, Imperial Father.

30
00:02:14,106 --> 00:02:15,220
In arts and literature,

31
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:16,102
out of all us brothers,

32
00:02:16,102 --> 00:02:17,682
he is one of the best.

33
00:02:17,682 --> 00:02:18,890
All of these years,

34
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:21,165
he has followed Imperial Father everywhere.

35
00:02:21,165 --> 00:02:22,930
He has always been cautious in word and action.

36
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:24,602
He has never dared to do anything that exceeds his position

37
00:02:24,602 --> 00:02:26,666
without considering you.

38
00:02:29,564 --> 00:02:31,846
Imperial Father, I understand

39
00:02:31,846 --> 00:02:33,332
you must punish him because of the law.

40
00:02:33,332 --> 00:02:35,011
That is between the Emperor and his officials,

41
00:02:35,011 --> 00:02:37,048
so this son should not say anything.

42
00:02:37,048 --> 00:02:38,209
Since you know,

43
00:02:38,209 --> 00:02:39,648
don't speak of it anymore.

44
00:02:39,648 --> 00:02:41,599
But you are also his Imperial Father!

45
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:43,874
Ya'Feng'Jia'Dao is a place that's dark and damp.

46
00:02:43,874 --> 00:02:45,414
Hot in the summer and cold in the winter,

47
00:02:45,414 --> 00:02:46,900
normal people can not survive it,

48
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:47,450
let alone

49
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:49,261
an Imperial Prince!

50
00:02:49,261 --> 00:02:49,958
If Imperial Father would

51
00:02:49,958 --> 00:02:52,001
allow Lu Wu to go and care for him,

52
00:02:52,001 --> 00:02:53,302
at least 13th Prince will

53
00:02:53,302 --> 00:02:54,602
have a person to talk to.

54
00:02:54,602 --> 00:02:57,070
Please, as a bond of love between father and son!

55
00:02:57,070 --> 00:03:00,082
Even though 13th Prince is on house arrest as a punishment,

56
00:03:00,082 --> 00:03:03,518
he is still an Imperial Prince.

57
00:03:03,518 --> 00:03:05,840
If I just send a very common girl

58
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,512
to be his night and day companion,

59
00:03:07,512 --> 00:03:08,952
how would that look?

60
00:03:08,952 --> 00:03:11,060
What would members of the Court think?

61
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:13,317
How would the people see this?

62
00:03:13,317 --> 00:03:15,200
I have met Lu Wu,

63
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,540
she is not as Imperial Father is thinking.

64
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:18,595
During the time that 13th Prince

65
00:03:18,595 --> 00:03:19,803
was prosperous, she was

66
00:03:19,803 --> 00:03:21,591
just a friendly companion.

67
00:03:21,591 --> 00:03:22,512
But now that he is in a time of need,

68
00:03:22,512 --> 00:03:24,160
she has volunteered

69
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,670
to serve him in any way.

70
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:26,900
This devotion

71
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:27,906
is rare and

72
00:03:27,906 --> 00:03:29,578
cannot be found in the average girl.

73
00:03:29,578 --> 00:03:32,683
Alright, concerning Lu Wu's situation,

74
00:03:32,683 --> 00:03:35,000
I don't want anyone to bring it up.

75
00:03:36,251 --> 00:03:39,809
Your son begs Imperial Father to allow it!

76
00:03:40,338 --> 00:03:42,317
Return home.

77
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:15,522
Water. Water.

78
00:05:16,244 --> 00:05:17,937
Water.

79
00:05:21,073 --> 00:05:24,600
Jie Jie, I brought water. Come.
( Jie Jie - Older Sister)

80
00:05:25,246 --> 00:05:26,800
Slowly.

81
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:40,392
The Emperor has already pardoned Older Sister.

82
00:05:40,392 --> 00:05:41,340
I'm not sure why, but

83
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:43,225
14th Prince was also ordered to kneel.

84
00:05:43,225 --> 00:05:44,060
I heard from

85
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:45,700
the servants outside,

86
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,312
that they heard 14th Prince and the Emperor

87
00:05:47,312 --> 00:05:48,420
arguing

88
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:50,260
and heard the words, "13th Prince".

89
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:52,100
Afterward, the 14th prince knelt outside

90
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:52,940
from that afternoon

91
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:54,380
until the end of the next day's Court.

92
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:56,043
Then 8th Prince, 9th Prince, and 10th Prince

93
00:05:56,043 --> 00:05:57,111
also came and knelt in asking for forgiveness.

94
00:05:57,111 --> 00:05:58,550
And the Emperor finally sent word

95
00:05:58,550 --> 00:05:59,380
to have 14th Prince get up

96
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:01,020
and also pardoned Older Sister.

97
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:02,920
When we went to find you

98
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,260
Jie'jie was lying in the rain.

99
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:05,620
You had fainted long before.

100
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:06,740
14th prince

101
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:09,440
knelt in the rain for one day and one night?

102
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,020
Is he alright?

103
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:13,740
14th Prince is a warrior

104
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,160
and his health is generally better than an average person.

105
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,800
In addition, compared to Jie'jie,

106
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,220
after kneeling for so long,

107
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:19,800
I heard he is just a little sore.

108
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,600
He's probably almost normal now.

109
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:25,420
Jie'jie, due to your kneeling,

110
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:27,040
you were unconscious for 3 days,

111
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:29,120
scaring us.

112
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,840
3 days.

113
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:40,100
The Imperial Physician said

114
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:42,260
Jie'jie went hungry for too long and became ill.

115
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:44,400
So we must regulate your meals, now.

116
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:55,688
Yu Tan, my knee hurts a lot.

117
00:06:55,688 --> 00:06:57,000
Jie'jie need not worry,

118
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Imperial Physician Li will be coming to see you.

119
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,460
The Emperor's personal physician?

120
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:02,080
Imperial Physician Li?

121
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,460
That gang who caused all this trouble

122
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:04,760
was secretly happy about it,

123
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,440
but now it seems they wasted all their efforts.

124
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,380
The Emperor specifically

125
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:08,500
issued that order

126
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,420
and not many people in the palace

127
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:11,520
have this kind of privilege.

128
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:15,420
I think Physician Li will be here soon,

129
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:17,960
so I'll go to get Jie'jie something to wear.

130
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,220
The Emperor's heart is quite hard to understand.

131
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:24,860
Rewards don't necessarily mean favor

132
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:28,920
and punishment doesn't necessarily mean disfavor.

133
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,420
10th Prince.

134
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:42,645
Just greeting me standing is fine.

135
00:07:42,645 --> 00:07:46,600
Greetings 10th Prince. Greetings 14th Prince.

136
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,280
Come.

137
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:54,920
I'm sorry to trouble you, Physician Li.

138
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:59,920
Physician Li, how is it?

139
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:14,540
How do you usually sleep?

140
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:15,660
Most of the time

141
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:17,440
I don't sleep very well.

142
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,500
This past year,

143
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,060
I have been sleeping less and less.

144
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:21,820
If there is even a little disturbance,

145
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:23,580
I will awaken and cannot fall back asleep easily.

146
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:25,180
What about your appetite?

147
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:28,020
I haven't been eating well either.

148
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:29,720
You do have stomach problems.

149
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,060
I heard last year the Lady

150
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:32,580
was extremely sick.

151
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:33,600
Now it seems that your

152
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,300
body has not fully recovered.

153
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:38,180
So you're anemic.

154
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:39,859
I can tell from your pulse that

155
00:08:39,859 --> 00:08:41,940
you have been worried for a long time

156
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:44,280
and have been frightened often.

157
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,980
Doctor, can you tell me

158
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:47,980
if it Is severe

159
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:49,379
and if I can get better?

160
00:08:49,379 --> 00:08:51,240
You are in the prime time of your life,

161
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,260
if you take care of yourself,

162
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:53,860
in a few years time,

163
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:55,660
you will get better gradually.

164
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:59,620
But if you do not take better care, in the future, well...

165
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:01,060
My knees hurt a lot,

166
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:02,740
when will they be better?

167
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:05,160
Putting on some medicine for a few days

168
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,660
and then using acupuncture,

169
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:08,500
they will also get better gradually.

170
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,080
But when it gets cold,

171
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,980
they will still ache.

172
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:13,500
You have to take good care of yourself

173
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:16,020
or else there will be bad consequences in the future.

174
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:18,460
Lady, see if this treatment works for you or not.

175
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:19,340
What the Physician is describing

176
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:20,420
should be

177
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:22,060
what we now call rheumatism.

178
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:24,100
Drink your medicine and rest well.

179
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:26,080
Thank you, Physician Li.

180
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,780
No need, Physician Li, you are getting older.

181
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:30,760
Excused.

182
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,140
Prolonged pressures...

183
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:40,260
What has been worrying you all this time?

184
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:41,900
Didn't the Physician say

185
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:44,060
as long as I take care of myself now, I will get better.

186
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:46,360
It's not a big worry.

187
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,260
This time, I thank you very much.

188
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:52,180
No need. For the grassland problem,

189
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:54,220
I still owe you two favors, from beginning to end.

190
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:55,580
If you consider the risks,

191
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:57,760
is this time worse than that?

192
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,700
Ruoxi, exactly what

193
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,020
is worrying you so much

194
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:04,400
that it's causing such prolonged pressure?

195
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:08,000
If it weren't for him being Imperial Physician Li,

196
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:11,040
I'd call him a quack!

197
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:14,460
Spouting nonsense to scare people!

198
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:16,000
Isn't it because of the Crown Prince

199
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,740
and 13th Prince's situation?

200
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:19,740
Physician Li said it's been so for a long time.

201
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:20,600
These latest situations

202
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,220
are barely a year old.

203
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:24,020
This is a prolonged pressure of 3 to 5 years,

204
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:25,780
otherwise, how would the illness be this deep?

205
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:27,340
You still have this idiotic habit

206
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:29,020
of keeping everything inside.

207
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:29,860
If we ask you something,

208
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:31,500
you either change the topic

209
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,840
or you remain silent!

210
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,180
Enough, 14th Brother,

211
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:37,380
she's still sick.

212
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:40,600
If she doesn't want to say, then don't push her.

213
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,660
But Ruoxi...

214
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:45,960
you should be happy today

215
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,820
because the thing you wanted accomplished,

216
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:51,160
the 14th Prince has gotten it done for you.

217
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:58,220
Imperial Father has allowed Lu Wu

218
00:10:58,220 --> 00:10:59,660
to become a palace maid.

219
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:00,360
However,

220
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,220
her name and background has to be changed

221
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:03,300
14th Prince already told

222
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:04,280
his estate manager

223
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,820
to adopt Lu Wu as his daughter.

224
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:06,560
In a few days,

225
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,060
she'll be sent on her passage to Yang Feng.

226
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:09,020
If she says

227
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:11,400
she's from his estate, it'll work out fine.

228
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,720
You--

229
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:26,860
I didn't do this

230
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:29,840
for you to bow to me.

231
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:34,420
That day, 8th Prince was afraid I would recklessly cause trouble,

232
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:35,420
so he hid it from me

233
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:37,260
and didn't tell me the situation.

234
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:38,820
Who would have thought that 14th Prince

235
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:40,240
would handle the situation alone.

236
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,260
If I had gone along with him

237
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:42,040
to talk to Imperial Father,

238
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:42,560
perhaps

239
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,880
he wouldn't have had to kneel for so long.

240
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,400
This was not the kind of situation where if there were more people

241
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,640
Imperial Father's heart would soften more.

242
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:52,060
What a total mess mixed up with kindness and resentments.

243
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:54,060
They were the cause of the situation,

244
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:57,720
yet they are also the ones who helped me.

245
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,840
10th Prince.

246
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,880
Could you please open the cabinet drawers

247
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:06,360
and take out the cases inside.

248
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,940
You're quite a rich lady.

249
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:19,060
These are all

250
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:21,460
rewards from the Emperor and other Masters.

251
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:22,900
I want to please ask you two to

252
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:24,620
help me take these to 13th Prince's house

253
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:26,680
and give them to his Fu'jin.

254
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,460
All of this is your personal wealth.

255
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:30,400
How can you give them all away?

256
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,720
13th Prince's household

257
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,820
relies on 13th Prince's income,

258
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,420
which originally was not even that much.

259
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:37,260
Now with 13th Prince like this,

260
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:39,940
they don't even have their old status.

261
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:41,940
A lot of things require money.

262
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:44,100
In order, for them not to suffer too much

263
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,580
and since I'm in the Palace,

264
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:46,500
these things just

265
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,020
stay lying in their boxes,

266
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:50,660
so why not send them over and let them be of use.

267
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:51,660
Let's do this then,

268
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:52,900
you keep one box for yourself

269
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:55,100
and the remaining two we'll take with us.

270
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:57,380
That's not necessary. I still have more.

271
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:58,580
The things my father and sister gave me,

272
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:00,580
I have kept them all.

273
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:02,300
I have also kept bank notes.

274
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:04,020
We will do as I suggested

275
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:06,920
or else I won't help!

276
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,920
For this situation, I will listen to 14th Prince!

277
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,560
Okay, fine then.

278
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,220
Don't worry,

279
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:19,340
I've already spoken

280
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:20,260
in front of Imperial Father

281
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:22,240
begging forgiveness for 13th Prince.

282
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,440
If he's suspicious, he would have been suspicious long ago.

283
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,880
If I'm going to do one thing, I might as well do two.

284
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,940
There's no difference.

285
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:29,700
In the future, I will do my best to

286
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,460
work with 13th Prince's wives to make sure everything is in order

287
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:32,660
and make sure they won't have to

288
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:34,853
endure petty people's bullying.

289
00:13:34,853 --> 00:13:37,500
About the money, you also don't need to worry too much.

290
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:40,660
Your money here will last for a while.

291
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:43,140
Let me handle the rest.

292
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:45,260
I'm not scared either. First of all,

293
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:47,060
the 13th Prince and my personality don't get along well,

294
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:48,660
so we don't meet often.

295
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:51,140
Second, I am a blunt person,

296
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:52,100
so Imperial Father won't suspect

297
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:53,980
I have other motives.

298
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:55,000
In this case,

299
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,060
with 14th Prince and I shielding them,

300
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:59,480
no one will dare to bully them.

301
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,380
Many thanks.

302
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:02,300
Let's consider this situation taken care of then.

303
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:05,280
So just get well and don't worry too much.

304
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:28,240
Jie'jie, I've brought back the medicine.

305
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:33,100
Just now when I came back,

306
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,580
I heard them say

307
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:35,780
Li Gong'gong had Wang Gong'gong

308
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:37,660
punished and beaten 20 strokes.

309
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:39,020
What was the situation?

310
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:40,700
I'm not sure of the details,

311
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:42,300
but they probably said things they should not have said.

312
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:46,080
And probably in regards to Jie'jie.

313
00:14:46,835 --> 00:14:49,568
Those strokes were unjust.

314
00:14:49,568 --> 00:14:51,911
Help me go over and see him.

315
00:14:52,925 --> 00:14:54,351
Jie'jie, you're still sick,

316
00:14:54,351 --> 00:14:54,815
what if something happens?

317
00:14:54,815 --> 00:14:56,162
Should have just let Yu Tan come over.

318
00:14:56,162 --> 00:14:57,323
Why personally come over?

319
00:14:57,323 --> 00:14:59,388
I can't bear such a responsibility.

320
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,596
Rest easy.

321
00:15:01,596 --> 00:15:04,403
Do we really need these formalities?

322
00:15:05,729 --> 00:15:07,068
Are your injuries better?

323
00:15:07,068 --> 00:15:09,405
They're alright, but they itch a lot

324
00:15:09,405 --> 00:15:11,766
But I shouldn't scratch so I am a bit irritable.

325
00:15:11,766 --> 00:15:12,927
Endure it,

326
00:15:12,927 --> 00:15:15,108
Itching means they're healing.

327
00:15:15,265 --> 00:15:17,105
Then I'll endure it.

328
00:15:17,594 --> 00:15:19,473
What happened?

329
00:15:22,795 --> 00:15:24,699
I won't withhold the situation from Jie'jie,

330
00:15:24,699 --> 00:15:26,487
as long as Jie'jie keeps it in her heart.

331
00:15:26,487 --> 00:15:28,856
You must not tell others.

332
00:15:28,856 --> 00:15:31,689
That news was spread by my master's orders.

333
00:15:31,689 --> 00:15:34,336
These strikes were also ordered by my master.

334
00:15:34,336 --> 00:15:36,727
Jie'jie, don't worry.

335
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:38,300
Li Dechuan's orders

336
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:40,768
means it's His Majesty's orders.

337
00:15:40,768 --> 00:15:43,275
But why would His Majesty do that?

338
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:44,580
Why let all the Princes

339
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:47,941
know why I was being punished?

340
00:15:48,777 --> 00:15:50,270
Unless...

341
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:52,088
He is purposely testing the princes'

342
00:15:52,088 --> 00:15:54,117
attitudes toward the 13th prince.

343
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:57,972
Jie'jie, are your legs not feeling well?

344
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:07,306
It is difficult to understand an Emperor's thoughts.

345
00:16:11,589 --> 00:16:12,858
Jie'jie.

346
00:16:12,858 --> 00:16:14,737
Jie'jie.

347
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:15,880
Yesterday's tea records

348
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,100
don't match up,

349
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,120
so we're all worried.

350
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,341
Jie'jie, you rest,

351
00:16:20,341 --> 00:16:22,174
I'll go there right now.

352
00:16:22,324 --> 00:16:23,360
Let's go.

353
00:16:33,377 --> 00:16:35,031
Come in.

354
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:02,480
You finally came.

355
00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:13,880
I can no longer ask Imperial Father for your hand in marriage.

356
00:17:18,865 --> 00:17:21,587
Since 13th Prince has been arrested,

357
00:17:23,059 --> 00:17:26,509
I already guessed you would say this.

358
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:33,753
You can hate me,

359
00:17:35,172 --> 00:17:38,080
since I have let you down.

360
00:17:46,497 --> 00:17:49,280
With Imperial Father's doting love for you,

361
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,752
he will definitely choose

362
00:17:52,752 --> 00:17:54,861
a better marriage for you.

363
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,060
Thank you for

364
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:14,920
everything you did for 13th prince.

365
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:08,920
Jie'jie.

366
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,600
Yu Tan.

367
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:26,920
Tell me.

368
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,260
Why are the ones being sacrificed

369
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:30,280
are always women?

370
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:34,220
What's strange is, we

371
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:36,440
don't even have a shred of anger.

372
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:41,120
Is it really worth it?

373
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,780
When I was young,

374
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:54,040
my father passed away.

375
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:56,620
Although we weren't wealthy,

376
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:59,480
we were warm and well-fed.

377
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,220
But because of father's sickness,

378
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:04,220
anything that could be pawned

379
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:06,760
was pawned for money.

380
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:15,840
I was afraid he would leave us.

381
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:21,380
I heard people say, one's flesh can cure one's relative

382
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:24,480
and filial piety could move Bodhisattva.

383
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,540
Behind my parents' back,

384
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:28,997
I secretly cut some flesh off my arm

385
00:20:28,997 --> 00:20:32,840
and cooked it in with the medicine.

386
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,280
But father still passed away.

387
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:44,040
After my father passed away,

388
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:47,380
my mother helped by washing people's clothes day and night.

389
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:49,840
I helped by sewing for people.

390
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:53,940
But we only had enough food to be half-full.

391
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:56,180
Afterward, Mother often cried

392
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:58,840
and her eyes weren't very good.

393
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:02,680
She tried to hid it from me and my siblings.

394
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,740
Even though she couldn't see well,

395
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:07,960
she pretended she could.

396
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:11,740
We didn't want her to be sad,

397
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:14,760
so we pretended along with her.

398
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,420
Afterward, Mother's eyes

399
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:22,860
got worse and worse.

400
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:24,100
I ran to

401
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:26,380
all our relatives to borrow money.

402
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:31,540
The saying goes, that the poor don't have relatives.

403
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:37,600
Anyone who saw me coming would immediately closed the door.

404
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,740
I listlessly

405
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:43,220
wandered around the streets with no purpose.

406
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:45,600
Just wandering aimlessly.

407
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:48,100
Because I was absent-minded,

408
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:50,960
I didn't see the carriage that appeared suddenly..

409
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:52,740
The person who was steering the carriage

410
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:54,980
raised his whip to hit me...

411
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,700
And then what happened?

412
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:59,660
And then, the Young Master sitting in the carriage,

413
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:01,720
stopped him.

414
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,260
Are you looking for death?

415
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:08,640
Do you know whose carriage you're stopping?

416
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:12,140
It's one young girl

417
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:15,140
wandering aimlessly. So what?

418
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:17,720
You're a dog, a servant who didn't pay attention.

419
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:21,220
When a problem arises you look for someone else to take the blame.

420
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:22,340
I beg you.

421
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:23,640
I beg you to give me some money.

422
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,040
Please, Sir!

423
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,680
This is interesting.

424
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,920
I'm this old,

425
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:28,940
yet this is the first time anyone has dared

426
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:31,660
to beg me like this for money.

427
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:32,920
Why don't you tell me

428
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,660
why I should give you money?

429
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:36,180
I have to give my mother

430
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:38,020
and brother money to see the doctor.

431
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:40,000
I am not someone operating a charity.

432
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,660
That has nothing to do with me. I do not care.

433
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:45,480
If you can give me some money

434
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,980
I will be your servant

435
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:49,880
and serve you my whole life.

436
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,100
At my estate,

437
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:53,640
I may lack other things,

438
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,600
but I definitely have a lot of servant girls.

439
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,940
I'm very capable

440
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:58,700
and I can do lots of things.

441
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:00,860
Even if I can't do something,

442
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:02,060
I can learn!

443
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:03,160
Those that can help me do things,

444
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:06,000
I already have a lot. Drive on.

445
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,860
I beg you, don't go!

446
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:08,860
- Please!
- Move!

447
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:10,180
Give me some money!

448
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,620
- I'm begging you!
- Move!

449
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:13,620
- Please!
- Let go!

450
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:15,140
I don't know, how at the time

451
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:16,860
I could have been so brave.

452
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:19,460
Maybe I just felt,

453
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:21,720
that his voice

454
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:25,100
had a calmness that I'd never heard before.

455
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:27,100
It was pleasant to hear.

456
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:28,940
He was scolding me

457
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:32,720
but without an angry tone.

458
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,100
Maybe I just felt,

459
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:37,460
he was someone with a lot of money

460
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:39,300
and if he could just give me a few coins

461
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:41,820
I would be able to save my mother and brother.

462
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:43,340
I'm begging you! Please!

463
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:44,460
Please stop!

464
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:45,780
- Please Stop!
- Move!

465
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:47,260
Move! Move!

466
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:50,920
Stop! Please Stop!

467
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,560
- Stop!
- Whoa!

468
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:58,360
How old are you?

469
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,100
10 years old.

470
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:05,080
Good girl. You are worth my money.

471
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,300
Give all the money you have on you

472
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:13,100
and give it to her.

473
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:14,763
Yes.

474
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,840
I'm giving this back.

475
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:27,200
I'm giving you all this money.

476
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,620
I'm also giving you these coins.

477
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:30,840
Later, you definitely

478
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:33,320
rush home and get the doctor.

479
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:34,900
You are just a young girl.

480
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:36,380
The banknote is worth a huge amount.

481
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:39,140
If you cannot exchange the banknotes,

482
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:41,360
then just keep them all.

483
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:46,020
Thank you, Mister.

484
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:50,160
Good. Your actions were straight-forward and nimble.

485
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:51,840
Wait, come back!

486
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:59,800
Wrap this around you.

487
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:01,440
Let's go!

488
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,260
Thank you!

489
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:10,340
Your generosity and grace,

490
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:12,720
I will never forget!

491
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:25,320
And then...

492
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,420
There's no more

493
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:32,700
From then on

494
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:35,600
I never saw that person again.

495
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,220
He had given me a lot of money.

496
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:39,540
After my mother was cured,

497
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:40,940
she continued to wash clothes for others

498
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:42,780
and my siblings and I, did needlework.

499
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:45,560
We survived until I entered the Palace.

500
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:48,620
Fate only allowed you two to meet once.

501
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:50,780
Even though we met only once,

502
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:51,580
in my heart,

503
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:53,840
I already made a promise.

504
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:56,840
For his sake,

505
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:01,120
I can willingly give up my life.

506
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:07,940
Older Sister, actually, whether it's worth it or not,

507
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:10,120
only I understand.

508
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,900
For example, my childhood friends

509
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:14,100
are now with their sons and daughters.

510
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:15,100
They probably feel that I

511
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:16,380
have a pitiful life.

512
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:19,260
But I don't think so at all.

513
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:20,780
I just know

514
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:21,940
because of my actions, my mother no longer needs

515
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:24,640
to wash clothes in icy water every day.

516
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:28,180
If she's sick, she'll be able to get a doctor.

517
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:30,740
My siblings are able to go to school.

518
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:31,980
I feel

519
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:33,980
that my decision before, was right.

520
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:35,300
What I did

521
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:37,220
was all worth it.

522
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:39,820
If you were to ask me to choose again,

523
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:42,640
I would be completely willing.

524
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:47,720
Whether it was worth it or not,

525
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:50,280
only you know.

526
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:53,440
Yu Tan...

527
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:56,180
from now on,

528
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:58,420
only you are by my side.

529
00:26:58,420 --> 00:27:00,780
Jie Jie, don't say foolish things.

530
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:01,960
The Emperor will for Jie'jie,

531
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:04,140
bestow a good marriage.

532
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:05,760
Maybe,

533
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:09,284
I will just leave it to Fate.

534
00:27:56,235 --> 00:27:59,080
Older Sister, I heard that the Emperor is going to confine the Crown Prince!

535
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,560
What?

536
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:06,360
The Emperor already gathered all the Princes  in Qianqing Palace.

537
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:08,000
It probably will happen today!

538
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,520
The Emperor

539
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:13,371
is finally going to depose the Crown Prince for the second time.

540
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,800
Crown Prince.

541
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,960
I am here.

542
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:11,160
Even after I restored your Crown Prince position,

543
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:16,200
You are still as undisciplined as before. Not one person respects you.

544
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:18,480
I cannot allow you to be

545
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,680
the next Emperor of this country.

546
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:25,040
Therefore, I am going to confine you.

547
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,720
Imperial Father...

548
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,720
Take him away.

549
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:31,283
- Yes.
- Yes.

550
00:29:31,283 --> 00:29:33,880
I really know my mistakes, Imperial Father.

551
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:36,480
- Spare us, Emperor. We know we're wrong.
- Spare us!

552
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:40,920
We know we're wrong, Imperial Father.

553
00:29:41,630 --> 00:29:44,040
We know we're wrong.

554
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:48,080
- Emperor, spare us!
- We know we're wrong!

555
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:09,700
The Crown Prince crisis appears to have settled down.

556
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:11,380
But the real battle

557
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:14,140
has only just begun.

558
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:19,700
The 4th Prince has gradually withdrawn from all government affairs.

559
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:21,500
He has become more secluded.

560
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:25,920
He lives like someone with few desires. Living his tranquil life like any rich man.

561
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:29,820
At his estate, he spends all day with monks and priests talking and in discussions.

562
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:31,900
If we meet by accident

563
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:34,260
we will not talk more than needed.

564
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:37,660
It's as if there was never anything between us.

565
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:40,020
His face is calm and cold.

566
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:43,420
He's become like that again. The cold reserved 4th Prince.

567
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,940
Ruoxi, come over here.

568
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:22,480
Come, take a look.

569
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,180
Do you see anything?

570
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:31,540
The one that is controlling the cart and doing the farm work, isn't that the 4th Prince?

571
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:34,660
The one that is standing near the bridge is his 4th Fu'Jin.

572
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:36,380
What else?

573
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:38,460
Can you see anything else?

574
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:41,900
Other things? I can't really see anything else

575
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:44,100
except that it is very well drawn.

576
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:46,580
However, what values most is its meaning.

577
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:52,140
You don't think that this

578
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:55,380
is very similar to Nan Song Dynasty's Luo Chou drawing of Farming and Weaving?

579
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:57,780
I deserve to die.

580
00:31:57,780 --> 00:31:59,420
I am beside the Emperor every day

581
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:00,740
and I didn't pay close attention.

582
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:03,340
I even forgot what your favorite painting was!

583
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:08,380
A most important thing for the good of the people.

584
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:11,080
Agriculture is very important.

585
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:14,220
Every spring I reside at Xian'Nong'Tan

586
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:16,909
to honor and pray to ancestors and the gods of agriculture.

587
00:32:16,909 --> 00:32:21,460
I will even coach others in the planting of the Royal farmland.

588
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:24,180
I constantly emphasize this to the officers of the Imperial  Court.

589
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:26,300
I hope that all public servants

590
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:29,860
know the importance of agriculture.

591
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:33,140
It is the foundation of the Empire.

592
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:35,180
I followed the example of Imperial Father

593
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:37,140
and cultivated a few fields on my estate.

594
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:39,660
This way I could really experience the happiness and bitterness of farming.

595
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:43,000
Tell me. Where is the source of happiness?

596
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,500
What is the source of bitterness?

597
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:48,260
The life of farming and gardening is unrestrained and enjoyable.

598
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:50,140
It not only makes me free from worry,

599
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:52,100
it allows me not to think about losses and gains as well as any stratagems.

600
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:53,300
I have become more open-hearted.

601
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:54,860
While I was farming,

602
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:56,580
my body was able to stretch out

603
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:58,460
and become more healthy.

604
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:02,220
These last few days, I even harvested melons and fruits that were planted by me.

605
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:04,140
It is unspeakable happiness.

606
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:06,620
The only bad part is

607
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:08,660
that even though I only planted a few fields

608
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:10,695
I already feel very tired.

609
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:13,300
Today I am worrying that the sun is burning too brightly.

610
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:15,660
Tomorrow I will worry that the rain is flowing too much.

611
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,100
I think about all the ordinary people

612
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:19,940
who are doing hard work every day under the wind and sun.

613
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:21,860
If a flood or drought appears,

614
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:23,860
they can harvest nothing.

615
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:25,740
I could only sigh.

616
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:33,580
The 4th Prince becomes better at hiding his (true) thoughts

617
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:35,340
and is very filial toward his Imperial Father.

618
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:37,020
He never defies his Imperial Father,

619
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:39,500
although the Emperor still harbors suspicions of him.

620
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:40,780
If he continues to act like this over time

621
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:42,380
and doesn't make any mistakes,

622
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:45,460
sooner or later the Emperor will relent.

623
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:47,140
Concerning 2nd Prince's situation,

624
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:49,260
the Emperor is tired in body and heart.

625
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:54,340
Everyone, please stop mentioning and recommending me as the Crown Prince

626
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:56,780
in order to avoid more trouble.

627
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:58,459
The longer the Crown Prince position remains unsettled

628
00:33:58,459 --> 00:33:59,860
the longer the Imperial Court will rattle.

629
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:01,380
Bei'Le'Ye really deserves the title--

630
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:02,500
Enough.

631
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:04,984
Today's conversation ends here.

632
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:08,620
If anyone talks of recommending me again,

633
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:11,980
I will close the door and stay at my estate

634
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:13,980
and lie in bed.

635
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:19,420
You are just a Bei'Le'Ye,

636
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:21,492
how could you be so arrogant?

637
00:34:21,492 --> 00:34:24,260
You enticed the Imperial officers privately.

638
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:26,780
You've tried to probe into my intention several times.

639
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:28,860
You're vying for the Crown Prince position.

640
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:31,980
You really disappoint me!

641
00:34:39,180 --> 00:34:41,380
The Emperor has feared the 8th Prince all along.

642
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:42,420
No matter what restraint he practices,

643
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:45,420
he can't do anything right in the Emperor's eyes.

644
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:48,780
Everytime he comes near, the Emperor scolds him for having ulterior motives.

645
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:52,380
If he retreats, the Emperor scolds him for having thoughts of probing further.

646
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:54,180
If he could only learn from the 4th Prince.

647
00:34:54,180 --> 00:34:55,660
Have a heart like water

648
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:57,577
and stay far away from every Imperial official.

649
00:34:57,947 --> 00:34:59,980
However, he's spent many years to reach his current position,

650
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:02,099
how can he let go of it easily?

651
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:18,620
Zhang Ting Yu, the Shilong from the Li Department
(Shilong - Assistant Minister)

652
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:20,900
is someone with ability.

653
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:23,620
Previously, I have heard others praise this person.

654
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:26,020
He is cautious and pure-hearted.

655
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:28,940
This officer election

656
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:30,900
will be handled by you alone.

657
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:33,420
You can get a better understanding of this person.

658
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:36,060
In the future, there will be grand possibilities.

659
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:37,580
I understand.

660
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:38,780
- Li De Quan.
- Your Majesty?

661
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:41,820
Today, make some more dishes that 14th likes to eat.

662
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:43,100
Yes.

663
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:45,140
Come.

664
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:54,060
Take a look.

665
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:55,460
This...

666
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:57,500
It looks like, after the Crown Prince,

667
00:35:57,500 --> 00:36:00,700
the one he favors the most is 14th Prince.

668
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:03,940
Although 14th Prince, because of 13th Prince, knelt as a punishment,

669
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:06,100
the result is that beyond expectations,

670
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:08,180
the Emperor didn't drift away from him.

671
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:11,138
Instead, the Emperor frequently appoints him alone to handle matters of the Empire.

672
00:36:11,138 --> 00:36:13,660
The Emperor also constantly calls on him to accompany him privately.

673
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:15,740
As for me,

674
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:17,941
if it's possible,

675
00:36:17,941 --> 00:36:20,420
I'd rather just be a spectator forever.

676
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:23,746
It's too bad that at this time,

677
00:36:23,746 --> 00:36:25,580
I am just like the princes,

678
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:29,540
not knowing our fates

679
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:33,220
and just having to count our steps as we go along.

680
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:44,380
Hurry up now.

681
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:45,460
Soon the dinner feast will start.

682
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:46,571
Yes.

683
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:49,940
Older Sister,

684
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:53,900
there's someone looking for you.

685
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:05,620
Older Sister!

686
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:07,580
You're still so naughty.

687
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:09,780
Let me see.

688
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:13,900
Did you grow thinner again?

689
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:17,900
Why do you say that every time you see me?

690
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:21,020
It is as if I had a lot of grievances in the Palace.

691
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:24,500
Jie Jie, sit down

692
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:33,660
Come, drink tea.

693
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:40,186
After this year, in another year,

694
00:37:40,186 --> 00:37:43,483
according to the rules, you'll leave the palace.

695
00:37:44,691 --> 00:37:49,149
Has the Emperor talked about marriage?

696
00:37:52,191 --> 00:37:53,584
I would rather

697
00:37:53,584 --> 00:37:56,020
have the Emperor keep me in the palace for a lifetime.

698
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:57,540
Silly girl.

699
00:37:57,540 --> 00:38:00,060
After all, women have to get married.

700
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:02,140
Are you willing to serve his Majesty forever

701
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:03,580
and also the princes?

702
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:05,020
Don't worry Jie Jie.

703
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:08,900
In the palace, there are Mu Mus who serve their masters until their elder days.  (Mu Mu - Elder ranked Palace maids)

704
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:10,580
They are still highly respected.

705
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:12,540
There's more freedom in that than marrying someone.

706
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:14,420
Is that really what you think?

707
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:21,220
Everything depends on the Emperor's judgement.

708
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:29,060
Older Sister, don't worry about me.

709
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:31,860
People can only look forward.

710
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:35,460
Thinking about the past will only make things difficult for ourselves.

711
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:41,420
I've recited the Buddhist texts for so many years, my heart has become like water.

712
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:45,220
No matter if it's now, in the past, or in the future,

713
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:47,580
everything is bound together by cause and effect.

714
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:50,380
I leave everything to fate.

715
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:54,180
Jie Jie.

716
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,900
Greetings, Imperial Father.

717
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:27,940
Rise.

718
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:29,390
Thank you, Imperial Father

719
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:32,460
I suddenly got the thought

720
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:34,140
and wanted to see the fields you planted.

721
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:36,060
I heard you had a good harvest.

722
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:37,820
Take me to see it.

723
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:39,580
I obey your order.

724
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:55,060
Imperial Father,

725
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:57,420
at first, I was very nervous.

726
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:59,580
Every day I watered it two and three times.

727
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:01,820
I was afraid that these trees would be affected by the drought.

728
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:05,060
But I didn't know why the leaves would turn more yellow and dry out.

729
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:07,900
After I sincerely asked those who farmed, I found out

730
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:10,940
that the roots of these fruit trees were afraid of dampness.

731
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:13,540
If I had kept on watering them the same way,

732
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:15,340
then by the time Imperial Father came,

733
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:18,340
you would only see trees but no fruit.

734
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:21,340
Too much can be worse than having too little.

735
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:23,180
Fortunately, I found out in time.

736
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:25,020
Come, Imperial Father.

737
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:29,220
Imperial Father, all of these

738
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:32,020
were personally planted by me.

739
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:34,700
What is this?

740
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:36,180
This is chayote.
(A edible gourd plant)

741
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:03,620
Imperial Father,

742
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:07,100
The area around the pavilion up front, many of your favorite chrysanthemums are planted.

743
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:08,740
You simply must look at them.

744
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:09,720
A few of them also

745
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:11,340
were grown personally by me.

746
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:14,100
Fine. Take me there to see them.

747
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:15,460
This way, please.

748
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:28,900
Imperial Father, this way, please

749
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:34,380
This West Lake willow was grown by me too.

750
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:36,260
The trunk is thick and the leaves are large.

751
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:37,620
The flowers are a pure white.

752
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:38,940
The fruits are plentiful too.

753
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:41,220
Looks like a luminous moon facing the water.

754
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:45,420
When winter flowers are gone only chrysanthemums will still blossom.

755
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:47,300
During the time when all other flowers are gone,

756
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:50,140
chrysanthemums will add the color of autumn in this garden.

757
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:52,420
I always yearn for the life in "Li Sao",
( Chinese poem from Warring era)

758
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:55,060
where one could eat chrysanthemum flowers at sunset.

759
00:41:55,060 --> 00:41:58,020
By doing this, I fulfilled my wish.

760
00:41:58,020 --> 00:42:00,180
"Dew from magnolia leaves I drank at dawn
(From Li Sao)

761
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:02,540
At eve for food were aster petals borne..."

762
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:04,540
It is really elegant.

763
00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:06,220
Thank you, Imperial Father.

764
00:42:06,607 --> 00:42:07,821
Emperor,

765
00:42:07,821 --> 00:42:09,818
you've already spent almost half a day out here.

766
00:42:09,818 --> 00:42:12,579
Let your servant escort you back inside to rest.

767
00:42:12,579 --> 00:42:13,896
Today I am happy.

768
00:42:13,896 --> 00:42:15,739
I walked so much, yet I am not tired.

769
00:42:15,739 --> 00:42:16,968
Let's go.

770
00:42:23,023 --> 00:42:25,474
The Emperor didn't eat any snacks.

771
00:42:25,474 --> 00:42:26,899
Since he walked this far

772
00:42:26,899 --> 00:42:28,900
he must be hungry by now

773
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:30,761
after just looking at his own son's plants,

774
00:42:30,761 --> 00:42:31,947
crops, fruits, and melons.

775
00:42:31,947 --> 00:42:34,383
It still lacks a little insight though.

776
00:42:34,383 --> 00:42:35,776
If he could try

777
00:42:35,776 --> 00:42:38,988
pastry made from these, it would be much better.

778
00:42:41,885 --> 00:42:43,485
Gao Wu Yong.

779
00:42:43,967 --> 00:42:44,911
Yes.

780
00:42:44,911 --> 00:42:45,932
Tell Fu'jin

781
00:42:45,932 --> 00:42:48,336
to make some desserts to accompany the tea for  Imperial Father.

782
00:42:48,336 --> 00:42:49,831
Yes.

783
00:42:58,208 --> 00:42:59,462
I made some desserts for you.

784
00:42:59,462 --> 00:43:00,902
I hope you will enjoy them.

785
00:43:00,902 --> 00:43:02,667
The flavor is probably not equal to those from the palace

786
00:43:02,667 --> 00:43:04,664
but it's from my heart.

787
00:43:04,664 --> 00:43:07,236
I hope that Imperial Father won't laugh.

788
00:43:07,236 --> 00:43:09,282
Alright.

789
00:43:18,774 --> 00:43:19,431
This chestnut cake

790
00:43:19,431 --> 00:43:20,646
is made from the chestnuts Wang'ye grew

791
00:43:20,646 --> 00:43:22,943
and crushed into powder.

792
00:43:23,565 --> 00:43:24,911
This is chrysanthemum cake.

793
00:43:24,911 --> 00:43:25,801
It is made from

794
00:43:25,801 --> 00:43:27,744
the chrysanthemums Imperial Father just admired.

795
00:43:27,744 --> 00:43:29,391
I have often recited

796
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:32,674
"At eve for food were aster petals borne",

797
00:43:32,674 --> 00:43:34,778
now I have finally tasted it.

798
00:43:35,267 --> 00:43:38,029
Let me pose as a culture lover for once.

799
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:45,552
The taste is delicious.

800
00:43:51,793 --> 00:43:54,494
Why has the person who usually has the most to say

801
00:43:54,494 --> 00:43:57,487
became mute so suddenly?

802
00:43:57,900 --> 00:43:59,005
Now that Your Majesty

803
00:43:59,005 --> 00:44:01,049
has such an intelligent daughter-in-law to serve you,

804
00:44:01,049 --> 00:44:02,667
of course, Your Majesty will ignore me.

805
00:44:02,667 --> 00:44:05,175
I always heard Lady Ruoxi has a clever mind

806
00:44:05,175 --> 00:44:06,243
and has been with Imperial Father

807
00:44:06,243 --> 00:44:07,450
for so many years.

808
00:44:07,450 --> 00:44:08,520
Your views and attitude

809
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:10,383
cannot be compared with an ordinary person's.

810
00:44:10,383 --> 00:44:11,420
The words you just said

811
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:12,977
are putting me to shame.

812
00:44:12,977 --> 00:44:14,616
Don't mind her.

813
00:44:14,616 --> 00:44:17,262
She likes to play around.

814
00:44:18,773 --> 00:44:19,701
Li'de'quan.

815
00:44:19,701 --> 00:44:20,340
Your Majesty.

816
00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:21,800
The Jade Ruyi from Burma's tributes,

817
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:23,940
are there any left?

818
00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:25,860
Replying to the Emperor,

819
00:44:25,860 --> 00:44:27,589
there were 4 in total.

820
00:44:27,589 --> 00:44:29,660
One is with the Dowager Empress.

821
00:44:29,660 --> 00:44:31,940
One was given to Mi Fei.

822
00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:32,737
And one

823
00:44:32,737 --> 00:44:34,316
was rewarded to Min Min Ge'ge.

824
00:44:34,316 --> 00:44:36,591
There is still one left.

825
00:44:36,591 --> 00:44:38,170
Bring it here in a bit.

826
00:44:38,170 --> 00:44:39,800
I want to bestow it on 4th Fujin.

827
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:41,535
Yes.

828
00:44:43,550 --> 00:44:45,560
Thank you, Imperial Father.

829
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:47,460
Rise.

830
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:49,520
I haven't been in a state

831
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:51,940
of such enjoyment and leisure.

832
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:53,380
No precious item

833
00:44:53,380 --> 00:44:56,100
can compare to your filial piety.

834
00:44:57,400 --> 00:45:01,280
Who says there is no familial happiness in the Imperial Family.

835
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:03,805
Today, I am like

836
00:45:03,805 --> 00:45:05,220
an ordinary elderly person.

837
00:45:05,220 --> 00:45:06,960
An ordinary elderly person,

838
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:09,280
eating what my son personally planted

839
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:12,511
and my daughter-in-law personally made.

840
00:45:21,380 --> 00:45:22,400
That's all.

841
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:25,260
Let it shine in its beauty.

842
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:29,360
Why don't you want this flower?

843
00:45:42,780 --> 00:45:45,280
I couldn't bear to see,

844
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:47,480
once it is plucked,

845
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:49,340
how it will quickly wilt.

846
00:45:49,340 --> 00:45:51,540
Why don't you hate me?

847
00:45:54,620 --> 00:45:56,640
Why should I hate you?

848
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:58,700
Because you did not keep your promise?

849
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:01,300
What a joke.

850
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:03,480
Do you have to hold onto your promises

851
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:05,460
even at the cost of death?

852
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:07,580
Putting aside the fact that this matter

853
00:46:07,580 --> 00:46:10,300
concerned the 13th Prince's future

854
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:12,380
or even if only the two of us were implicated,

855
00:46:12,380 --> 00:46:15,240
I'm not willing to hold on to you and die.

856
00:46:15,980 --> 00:46:18,600
I would rather live freely.

857
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:24,480
If you can't endure small problems, you will ruin the bigger plan.

858
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:26,600
Now, because of one wrong step,

859
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:28,820
the 13th Prince and his family

860
00:46:28,820 --> 00:46:31,660
might never see each other again.

861
00:46:31,660 --> 00:46:33,900
Only with endurance

862
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:37,060
can one have happiness in the future.

863
00:46:39,980 --> 00:46:41,100
Because, in the past, you

864
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:42,840
and 13th prince were close,

865
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:44,800
from an outsider's point of view,

866
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:46,240
he broke the law and falsely used

867
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:47,920
your name.

868
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:50,580
You must avoid arousing more suspicion.

869
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:53,880
And 13th Prince admitted

870
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:56,088
he did this behind your back.

871
00:46:56,088 --> 00:46:58,560
It is disloyal and dishonest.

872
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:00,740
Anyone would be wary

873
00:47:01,540 --> 00:47:03,440
of suddenly turning around

874
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:05,240
and taking care of his wives and children

875
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:07,460
or forgiving him.

876
00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:13,020
Even a sage couldn't accomplish this.

877
00:47:16,740 --> 00:47:18,820
You really understand me.

878
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:31,900
