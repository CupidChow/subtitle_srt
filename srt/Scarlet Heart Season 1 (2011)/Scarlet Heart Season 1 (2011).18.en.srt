00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:19,880
♫  In the blink of an eye, a thought of stubborn persistence  ♫

3
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:24,080
♫  We were destined to seek our doom like moths flying towards the flame  ♫

4
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:30,570
♫  Knowing that it’d be a disaster, why am I still at a loss about what to do  ♫

5
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:39,010
♫  The best is not to see, the best is not to miss you  ♫

6
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:43,850
♫  Only like this can I not be in love with you  ♫

7
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:47,890
♫  Just another brushing of the shoulder, and from then...♫

8
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:53,360
♫  I’ll keep falling deeper and deeper in love with you  ♫

9
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:58,120
♫  It’s the mistake of time, ♫

10
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:01,630
♫ forcing us to pass each other by  ♫

11
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:05,320
♫  How I miss you, how far you are  ♫

12
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:07,740
♫  Even though I’d known it’d only result in pain, ♫

13
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:11,450
♫ at this moment, I still don’t want to escape  ♫

14
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:16,340
♫  Pity these words are too glaring, they hurt the eyes  ♫

15
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:21,990
♫  Two worlds later ♫

16
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:25,210
♫  Don’t want to escape  ♫

17
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:27,610
♫  It’s the mistake of time,♫

18
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:30,340
♫ we can only pass each other by  ♫

19
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:35,300
♫  The magnitude of me missing you is as much as how far you are   ♫

20
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:41,140
♫  Even though I know the ending is a mistake that I cannot oppose  ♫

21
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,350
♫  Staying in this moment  ♫

22
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:54,760
♫  We can only accept that the feelings run deep, but fate is shallow  ♫

Scarlet Heart
Episode 18

24
00:02:06,031 --> 00:02:07,464
Greetings, 4th Prince.

25
00:02:07,464 --> 00:02:08,850
Rise.

26
00:02:13,729 --> 00:02:15,620
You were wearing the hairpin,

27
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:16,458
why take it off?

28
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,220
Nothing, I was afraid 4th Prince would laugh at me.

29
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:21,200
Why?

30
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:23,825
This magnolia hairpin,

31
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,040
although I've kept it until now,

32
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:29,685
I unknowingly put it on today.

33
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,318
And then...

34
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:34,183
And then what?

35
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,287
And then...

36
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:41,931
Are you willing to marry me?

37
00:02:47,915 --> 00:02:50,337
Right now, I'm not willing to marry you.

38
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:51,640
You're not willing to?

39
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:57,263
If I have to marry the Crown Prince,

40
00:02:57,263 --> 00:02:59,074
I would rather die.

41
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,507
That won't do either.

42
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:01,947
Don't forget,

43
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,176
I saved your life.

44
00:03:04,176 --> 00:03:05,676
Without my permission,

45
00:03:05,676 --> 00:03:07,340
you're not allowed to die.

46
00:03:12,235 --> 00:03:13,951
Why the Crown Prince suddenly wants you,

47
00:03:13,951 --> 00:03:15,577
I'm sure you're aware of it.

48
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,084
If I ask for your hand from Father now,

49
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:21,405
then won't I be snatching you from the Crown Prince?

50
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,170
Going down that train of thought,

51
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:24,981
what concerns Father the most?

52
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,320
I'm afraid that if I put in the request,

53
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,532
it would rouse Father's suspicions.

54
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:33,711
So for now,

55
00:03:33,711 --> 00:03:35,174
no one dares to marry you.

56
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:41,095
You can only wait.

57
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:44,253
Wait?

58
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,510
Since you're already wearing my hairpin

59
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:51,103
and said you want to marry me,

60
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,332
what do you think you have to wait for?

61
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:58,023
Thank you,

62
00:03:58,023 --> 00:03:59,718
for helping me get past this problem.

63
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,545
I didn't do anything.

64
00:04:01,545 --> 00:04:04,153
You merely fell sick at the right time.

65
00:04:04,153 --> 00:04:05,353
Hurry and go back,

66
00:04:05,353 --> 00:04:06,475
you've only just recovered.

67
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,379
You should rest more and recuperate.

68
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,429
You look really pale now.

69
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,216
I don't want to marry an ugly woman

70
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,669
Thank you, 8th Prince.

71
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,187
Rise.

72
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,692
The Crown Prince is lecherous. Everyone knows this.

73
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,580
I can't possibly watch you

74
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:50,384
marry this kind of person

75
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:53,913
Even if you don't marry me,

76
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,443
I don't want you to suffer with him

77
00:05:00,227 --> 00:05:02,480
8th Prince, you should go back.

78
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,221
It's not good for you to stay here for too long.

79
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,287
Regarding your marriage,

80
00:05:11,287 --> 00:05:13,191
do you have any plans?

81
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,158
What kind of plans can I have?

82
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,737
As a servant,

83
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,616
I cannot make my own decisions.

84
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:24,703
Furthermore, this is your decision to make.

85
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,746
Why are you concerned about me?

86
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,276
You have someone else in your heart, don't you?

87
00:05:31,644 --> 00:05:34,491
Why do you always ask me this question?

88
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:37,149
I have no control over what becomes of me.

89
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,960
Don't tell me that you

90
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,814
want to control my heart as well?

91
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,554
I hope it's not 4th Brother.

92
00:05:45,554 --> 00:05:48,016
Otherwise, you'll only suffer

93
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,152
and waste

94
00:05:50,152 --> 00:05:52,102
the efforts I've put in to help you today.

95
00:05:54,206 --> 00:05:58,293
Whether or not that is the case, it has nothing to do with you.

96
00:05:58,293 --> 00:06:00,369
In any case, both of us know

97
00:06:00,369 --> 00:06:01,553
this matter

98
00:06:01,553 --> 00:06:04,130
can only be decided by the Emperor

99
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:08,658
If you're willing only to abide by Father's decision,

100
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,073
then just take it that

101
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,928
I did not say the things I just said.

102
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,857
- Master.
- Master.

103
00:07:03,345 --> 00:07:05,899
Mother.

104
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,230
8th Prince.

105
00:07:23,728 --> 00:07:25,516
Mother.

106
00:07:26,508 --> 00:07:28,279
I just talked with the Physician.

107
00:07:28,279 --> 00:07:30,485
He said that you're getting better

108
00:07:30,485 --> 00:07:32,436
and you can get up from the bed soon.

109
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,591
Even if I can leave this bed,

110
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,152
there won't be many days left

111
00:07:40,152 --> 00:07:41,845
for me to walk around.

112
00:07:41,845 --> 00:07:43,999
You still have many days.

113
00:07:46,972 --> 00:07:49,526
If I can live for one more day,

114
00:07:50,455 --> 00:07:51,346
you'll have to suffer one more day

115
00:07:51,346 --> 00:07:53,287
on my behalf.

116
00:07:54,681 --> 00:07:57,699
Mother, don't say that.

117
00:07:57,699 --> 00:08:01,182
If it weren't for the fact that I was born with a lowly status,

118
00:08:02,204 --> 00:08:05,408
when everybody nominated you as Crown Prince,

119
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,077
your father

120
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:14,450
would definitely have let you be Crown Prince

121
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:17,111
Whenever I think about this,

122
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:22,305
I feel like I've let you down.

123
00:08:22,305 --> 00:08:24,992
Two completely unrelated matters,

124
00:08:24,992 --> 00:08:26,903
why have you linked them together?

125
00:08:26,903 --> 00:08:29,696
This is the fickleness of the world.

126
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,387
Who doesn't look at birth status?

127
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:43,930
If I came from a good family,

128
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,575
your path

129
00:08:50,199 --> 00:08:53,427
wouldn't have to be so rocky

130
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:58,589
Mother, tell me frankly,

131
00:08:58,589 --> 00:09:00,400
in your eyes,

132
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:03,458
how are my achievements to date?

133
00:09:03,458 --> 00:09:05,130
You definitely have not...

134
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:10,703
You definitely have not lost to the other Princes.

135
00:09:12,421 --> 00:09:17,529
Your Father once told me,

136
00:09:17,529 --> 00:09:19,866
in terms of ability and talent,

137
00:09:21,477 --> 00:09:24,588
many of the Princes cannot compare.

138
00:09:26,376 --> 00:09:28,350
It's just that

139
00:09:30,556 --> 00:09:32,715
it's only because of me

140
00:09:35,478 --> 00:09:38,683
that you can't be Crown Prince.

141
00:09:39,186 --> 00:09:41,167
What is bestowed by others

142
00:09:41,167 --> 00:09:43,889
cannot be compared to what one earns by his own means.

143
00:09:43,889 --> 00:09:45,786
If I didn't have the strength,

144
00:09:45,786 --> 00:09:48,087
would I dare to rise to the challenge.

145
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,034
You have drive.

146
00:09:52,034 --> 00:09:53,985
Mother, you should feel comforted.

147
00:09:53,985 --> 00:09:56,191
With a son like you

148
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:00,742
I have no regrets in life.

149
00:10:02,855 --> 00:10:04,828
These many years,

150
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,522
everything I've done

151
00:10:08,451 --> 00:10:10,062
was all to

152
00:10:10,062 --> 00:10:13,141
enable us to gain a sense of self respect

153
00:10:13,141 --> 00:10:15,417
and not let others belittle us.

154
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,386
Seeing you with such sureness like this,

155
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,726
I believe you will succeed.

156
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,277
Mother will help you.

157
00:10:32,716 --> 00:10:37,979
I will... I will definitely help you.

158
00:10:37,979 --> 00:10:40,526
Nursing your body back to health

159
00:10:40,526 --> 00:10:44,697
to become the Empress Dowager will be your help to me.

160
00:10:46,044 --> 00:10:47,782
No matter

161
00:10:47,782 --> 00:10:49,954
how lowly our births,

162
00:10:49,954 --> 00:10:53,914
we will surely atttain wealth and rank in our future.

163
00:10:53,914 --> 00:10:56,446
Alright.

164
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:00,301
In the future...

165
00:11:06,524 --> 00:11:09,032
All right.

166
00:11:10,193 --> 00:11:14,047
I know you have many things to do,

167
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,598
go back first.

168
00:11:18,598 --> 00:11:20,874
I want to spend more time with Mother.

169
00:11:22,731 --> 00:11:24,496
I'm tired.

170
00:11:26,493 --> 00:11:29,419
I want to rest.

171
00:11:41,261 --> 00:11:43,722
Don't worry about anything,

172
00:11:43,722 --> 00:11:47,298
I will resolve everything.

173
00:11:59,698 --> 00:12:01,648
Master.

174
00:12:01,648 --> 00:12:04,992
The only way I can help

175
00:12:06,663 --> 00:12:10,611
is to not drag you down.

176
00:12:13,095 --> 00:12:16,760
Mistress, it's time for your medicine.

177
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,527
From now on,

178
00:12:18,527 --> 00:12:22,987
I cannot eat medicine anymore.

179
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:26,145
Pour it away in secret.

180
00:12:27,445 --> 00:12:30,292
Don't let anyone know.

181
00:12:30,292 --> 00:12:32,275
Yes.

182
00:12:45,464 --> 00:12:48,297
Jie`jie, what's wrong with you?

183
00:12:50,154 --> 00:12:51,826
Are you all right?

184
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,595
The lotuses, Jie`jie has drawn,

185
00:12:55,595 --> 00:12:58,096
were really beautiful and lifelike.

186
00:12:58,096 --> 00:12:59,846
Ruined just like this.

187
00:12:59,846 --> 00:13:00,929
What a pity.

188
00:13:00,929 --> 00:13:03,065
Ruoxi Jie`jie, bad news!

189
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:06,144
Bad news! Mistress Liang has passed away!

190
00:13:06,144 --> 00:13:09,425
What? She's passed away?

191
00:13:09,425 --> 00:13:10,765
Why is it so sudden?

192
00:13:10,765 --> 00:13:12,112
It's not really sudden.

193
00:13:12,112 --> 00:13:14,796
I heard that about a week ago she was already unwell.

194
00:13:14,796 --> 00:13:15,936
She even saw the physician,

195
00:13:15,936 --> 00:13:17,422
but no one took it to heart.

196
00:13:17,422 --> 00:13:20,805
But who knew she would leave so suddenly.

197
00:13:23,057 --> 00:13:25,275
The 8th Prince must be devastated.

198
00:13:25,275 --> 00:13:27,128
But of course.

199
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:02,306
" Myriad things are all different and who believes in Taoism.
(Classic poem about a pear flower)

200
00:14:02,306 --> 00:14:05,378
Not in line with all the other flowers.

201
00:14:05,378 --> 00:14:09,390
Her spirit is distinct and her character is noble.

202
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:12,655
Could not be distinguishable on earth.

203
00:14:14,095 --> 00:14:16,277
When she returns back to Yao Tai,
(eastern heaven)

204
00:14:16,277 --> 00:14:21,014
only in the Goddess realm can her beauty and elegance  be viewed."

205
00:14:23,011 --> 00:14:24,783
Mistress Liang,

206
00:14:24,783 --> 00:14:28,730
Ruoxi will send you off from here.

207
00:14:56,753 --> 00:15:00,004
Stop!

208
00:15:11,021 --> 00:15:15,897
Move on!

209
00:15:18,414 --> 00:15:21,084
So this is the Emperor's love.

210
00:15:21,084 --> 00:15:24,985
But a mere moment's worth.

211
00:15:30,111 --> 00:15:31,237
Miss Ruoxi.

212
00:15:31,237 --> 00:15:33,662
The Emperor would like to see you.

213
00:15:33,662 --> 00:15:34,830
I'll go immediately.

214
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:36,409
Yes.

215
00:15:39,683 --> 00:15:40,721
Your Majesty.

216
00:15:40,721 --> 00:15:42,354
Ruoxi.

217
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:45,628
The Crown Prince said that the person kneeling by the back wall was you.

218
00:15:47,269 --> 00:15:49,204
Was it really you?

219
00:15:50,995 --> 00:15:53,397
In the past, I've been to Mistress Liang's palace

220
00:15:53,397 --> 00:15:55,359
to help her draw some designs.

221
00:15:55,359 --> 00:15:58,831
She was very pleased and complimented them.

222
00:15:58,831 --> 00:16:00,535
Today, I just happened to pass by

223
00:16:00,535 --> 00:16:03,175
and couldn't help but kowtow to her,

224
00:16:03,175 --> 00:16:04,473
so that I wouldn't disappoint

225
00:16:04,473 --> 00:16:07,185
her goodwill toward me in the past.

226
00:16:07,185 --> 00:16:08,453
You may rise.

227
00:16:14,156 --> 00:16:15,733
If you have the time,

228
00:16:15,733 --> 00:16:17,253
go and see the 8th Prince.

229
00:16:17,253 --> 00:16:18,732
Advise him,

230
00:16:18,732 --> 00:16:21,001
that even if he is grieving, he has to mind his health.

231
00:16:21,001 --> 00:16:22,733
Yes.

232
00:16:23,407 --> 00:16:24,637
You are dismissed.

233
00:16:50,626 --> 00:16:53,040
Greetings, 14th Prince.

234
00:16:56,943 --> 00:16:58,963
One can call you heartless,

235
00:16:58,963 --> 00:17:01,510
but you actually kowtowed before Concubine Liang's palace.

236
00:17:02,562 --> 00:17:04,609
One can call you compassionate,

237
00:17:04,609 --> 00:17:07,353
but since 8th Brother's mother passed away,

238
00:17:07,353 --> 00:17:08,962
he has been grieving

239
00:17:08,962 --> 00:17:10,772
and holing himself up at home.

240
00:17:10,772 --> 00:17:12,602
His health has never been good

241
00:17:12,602 --> 00:17:14,666
and now his leg ailment has suddenly flared up

242
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:16,139
to where even walking is a problem.

243
00:17:16,905 --> 00:17:18,679
Even completely unrelated people

244
00:17:18,679 --> 00:17:20,086
know how to say a few consoling lines.

245
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:21,950
But you remain indifferent,

246
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:23,351
as though you don't know.

247
00:17:23,351 --> 00:17:26,705
You didn't even off the basic words of asking how he is.

248
00:17:26,705 --> 00:17:30,050
Ruoxi, do you really not care about

249
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:32,436
how 8th Brother looked after you in the past?

250
00:17:32,436 --> 00:17:33,415
Let's not talk of the past,

251
00:17:33,415 --> 00:17:34,901
but even recently

252
00:17:34,901 --> 00:17:36,108
if it weren't for 8th Brother

253
00:17:36,108 --> 00:17:39,237
you'd probably be the Crown Prince's woman by now.

254
00:17:39,237 --> 00:17:40,563
Ruoxi,

255
00:17:40,938 --> 00:17:45,575
do you know how disappointed 8th Brother is?

256
00:17:45,575 --> 00:17:47,661
14th Prince.

257
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:51,308
Do you know what longing feels like?

258
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:54,906
It's like a needle in your heart.

259
00:17:54,906 --> 00:17:57,038
How the heart is wounded, how the heart hurts,

260
00:17:57,038 --> 00:17:59,142
you don't understand.

261
00:18:00,118 --> 00:18:03,504
Since two people can no longer be together,

262
00:18:03,504 --> 00:18:07,734
then why hinder them by doing things that make it so much harder to let go.

263
00:18:07,734 --> 00:18:11,170
To let their hearts continue to hurt.

264
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:15,350
Now, the more it hurts

265
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:18,361
the easier it will be for him to forget.

266
00:18:18,361 --> 00:18:19,244
I would rather

267
00:18:19,244 --> 00:18:21,434
he feel the hurt now, then

268
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:23,059
he will forget me completely.

269
00:18:23,865 --> 00:18:27,442
From now on, he won't think of me anymore.

270
00:18:27,442 --> 00:18:29,375
A needle in the heart?

271
00:18:31,834 --> 00:18:33,292
What feels like heartlessness

272
00:18:33,292 --> 00:18:34,939
is actually heartfelt concern.

273
00:18:35,203 --> 00:18:36,989
If you're willing to wait,

274
00:18:36,989 --> 00:18:39,104
it's still possible.

275
00:18:39,104 --> 00:18:40,690
Wait?

276
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:44,498
There's no turning back anymore.

277
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,534
Moreover,

278
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:50,428
will His Majesty let me wait forever?

279
00:18:50,428 --> 00:18:55,329
Then can you forget 8th Brother?

280
00:18:55,329 --> 00:18:57,223
I've already forgotten.

281
00:18:57,223 --> 00:18:59,763
I can see that your situation fits the old saying:

282
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:02,345
'Help each other when both are in humble circumstances'.

283
00:19:02,345 --> 00:19:04,567
I'm the silly one here.

284
00:19:04,567 --> 00:19:06,418
Alright then,

285
00:19:06,418 --> 00:19:08,618
since you've already made it so clear,

286
00:19:08,618 --> 00:19:09,861
from now on,

287
00:19:09,861 --> 00:19:12,466
I can at least put down this burden.

288
00:19:12,466 --> 00:19:15,141
What happens after today,

289
00:19:15,141 --> 00:19:16,324
even I cannot predict.

290
00:19:16,324 --> 00:19:17,942
From now on,

291
00:19:17,942 --> 00:19:19,964
you have to be very careful.

292
00:19:19,964 --> 00:19:22,293
What you can avoid, avoid.

293
00:19:22,293 --> 00:19:23,547
For many things,

294
00:19:23,547 --> 00:19:24,933
it only takes a moment

295
00:19:24,933 --> 00:19:26,008
to make a huge difference.

296
00:19:26,008 --> 00:19:27,952
It won't always be like today

297
00:19:27,952 --> 00:19:30,423
when people can save you.

298
00:19:30,423 --> 00:19:32,253
When a dog is forced into a corner

299
00:19:32,253 --> 00:19:34,228
it will react in panic and without reason.

300
00:19:34,228 --> 00:19:35,714
If we're affected,

301
00:19:35,714 --> 00:19:36,782
the few of us

302
00:19:36,782 --> 00:19:39,737
may not be able to ensure your safety.

303
00:19:39,737 --> 00:19:42,151
I understand.

304
00:19:42,151 --> 00:19:43,795
That's good.

305
00:20:28,029 --> 00:20:31,535
It's snowing. Why are you daydreaming?

306
00:20:32,741 --> 00:20:35,102
I'm not daydreaming.

307
00:20:35,102 --> 00:20:36,434
I'm admiring the blossoms.

308
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,914
You've watched them grow onto the walls.

309
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:46,140
What are you thinking about?

310
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:51,249
The days in this palace are getting harder to get by.

311
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,506
I have to be scared of this

312
00:20:53,506 --> 00:20:55,428
and of that.

313
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:58,011
So I was thinking

314
00:20:58,011 --> 00:20:59,885
if I could find a small place

315
00:20:59,885 --> 00:21:01,835
and ensconce myself in it,

316
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,461
it would be safer than staying in this palace.

317
00:21:10,716 --> 00:21:12,727
Have I said something wrong?

318
00:21:12,727 --> 00:21:14,956
Not everyone likes to hear the truth.

319
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,114
Women are natural actresses.

320
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,204
Lies, I know how to tell them.

321
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,651
If 4th Prince

322
00:21:22,651 --> 00:21:25,173
wants me to pretend to be gentle and sentimental,

323
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:27,541
I am willing to act out this farce.

324
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:29,910
But I feel that

325
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:32,557
you prefer to hear the truth

326
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,833
even if it hurts.

327
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,062
Where's the hairpin?

328
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:40,027
It's in the house.

329
00:21:40,027 --> 00:21:41,897
And the earrings I sent you last year

330
00:21:41,897 --> 00:21:44,212
are also left unused in the house.

331
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:47,509
What a waste of my sentiments.

332
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:50,999
I'm wearing the necklace.

333
00:21:54,035 --> 00:21:56,154
Ruoxi.

334
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:59,722
Do you not understand your own heart?

335
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,013
Too many fears and too many concerns.

336
00:22:03,013 --> 00:22:07,099
Every day you try to balance yourself and you have become too careful.

337
00:22:10,341 --> 00:22:12,590
It hurts. Why did you hit me?

338
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:14,285
Hurry and go back,

339
00:22:14,285 --> 00:22:16,636
you can daydream in front of the heater.

340
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,979
Aren't you leaving?

341
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:39,779
I don't understand my own heart.

342
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:42,721
What is it saying?

343
00:22:42,721 --> 00:22:46,141
Can he understand what my heart is saying?

344
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,642
Actually,

345
00:22:48,642 --> 00:22:52,000
I need to understand my thoughts and feelings.

346
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,673
More importantly,

347
00:22:53,673 --> 00:22:56,142
I need to know how to live safely

348
00:22:56,142 --> 00:22:58,285
in this tumultuous palace.

349
00:23:03,027 --> 00:23:04,299
It's been more than two months

350
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:05,823
since I last saw the 8th Prince.

351
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:07,443
His grief...

352
00:23:07,443 --> 00:23:09,686
Has it lessened?

353
00:23:14,771 --> 00:23:16,843
A person's heart is hard to understand.

354
00:23:16,843 --> 00:23:18,763
I can't read it clearly.

355
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:21,644
But I must make a decision.

356
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:26,195
I know that much.

357
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,205
Cutting ties is not easy.

358
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:53,107
It will hurt.

359
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,173
Greetings, 10th Prince. Greetings, 14th Prince.

360
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,666
Ruoxi, what's wrong?

361
00:24:28,666 --> 00:24:29,865
For this year's New Year eve,

362
00:24:29,865 --> 00:24:31,504
do you want us to bring you outside the palace for fun?

363
00:24:31,504 --> 00:24:32,533
10th Prince.

364
00:24:32,533 --> 00:24:34,430
Can you leave the palace on your own first?

365
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,420
I need to speak with 14th Prince.

366
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,303
What is it now that you're keeping from me?

367
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:41,921
What do I have to do with it?

368
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,029
I don't know what she wants to say.

369
00:24:44,029 --> 00:24:46,033
If you want to glare, glare at her.

370
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,247
You...

371
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,144
These past days

372
00:24:49,144 --> 00:24:51,041
I saw you and 10th Fujin from afar.

373
00:24:51,041 --> 00:24:52,156
Before I could greet 10th Fujin,

374
00:24:52,156 --> 00:24:54,142
you took her and ran away.

375
00:24:54,142 --> 00:24:55,917
Tell me, why are you avoiding me?

376
00:24:55,917 --> 00:24:56,985
If you want to settle a score,

377
00:24:56,985 --> 00:24:58,564
then we should settle things clearly.

378
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,255
I'm not going talk nonsense with you.

379
00:25:02,255 --> 00:25:03,573
Besides, I can't out talk you.

380
00:25:03,573 --> 00:25:06,506
You two can talk about whatever you want to talk about.

381
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,054
You saw 10th Fujin from afar.

382
00:25:13,054 --> 00:25:13,982
Not only did you not hide,

383
00:25:13,982 --> 00:25:15,515
were you still going up to greet her?

384
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,140
I was bluffing.

385
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,430
I actually wanted to avoid her,

386
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:21,506
but I didn't think that 10th Prince saw me too.

387
00:25:21,506 --> 00:25:23,108
He blocked 10th Fujin's line of sight

388
00:25:23,108 --> 00:25:24,687
and ran away faster than I could!

389
00:25:27,591 --> 00:25:29,368
I don't know when 10th Fujin's heart

390
00:25:29,368 --> 00:25:31,378
can open up and understand.

391
00:25:31,378 --> 00:25:33,803
Even you and I know 10th Brother's feelings.

392
00:25:33,803 --> 00:25:35,949
They're the only ones who still don't know it.

393
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,456
The ones involved are always clueless

394
00:25:38,456 --> 00:25:39,757
while the observers understand

395
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:41,846
But when the time comes

396
00:25:41,846 --> 00:25:43,286
they will understand.

397
00:25:43,286 --> 00:25:45,469
What do you want from me?

398
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:54,687
It seems like it's a bracelet.

399
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,327
What does this mean?

400
00:25:56,327 --> 00:25:58,124
Help me return it to the 8th Prince.

401
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,128
But there's no hurry,

402
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:01,692
just hold on to it

403
00:26:01,692 --> 00:26:03,395
and return it to him when he's feeling better.

404
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:05,917
Why are you asking me to do something that would only harm him?

405
00:26:05,917 --> 00:26:07,310
Return it yourself.

406
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:09,235
This bangle is too valuable.

407
00:26:09,235 --> 00:26:10,361
I must return it.

408
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:12,868
Just take it as I'm begging you.

409
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,323
4th Brother and 13th Brother are coming.

410
00:26:19,974 --> 00:26:21,831
Stop fooling around.

411
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,823
4th Brother, 13th Brother.

412
00:26:25,823 --> 00:26:27,265
14th Brother.

413
00:26:27,265 --> 00:26:30,919
- Greetings, 4th Prince, 13th Prince.
- Rise.

414
00:26:30,919 --> 00:26:33,014
4th Brother, are you leaving the palace?

415
00:26:33,014 --> 00:26:34,068
Not yet.

416
00:26:34,068 --> 00:26:36,226
I need to go now to visit mother.

417
00:26:36,226 --> 00:26:38,526
Fine, then I'll go first.

418
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:47,582
It would be impolite of me to decline. Thank you.

419
00:27:08,671 --> 00:27:10,427
No explanation?

420
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:14,460
4th Prince can believe it or not.

421
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:16,118
I only have one sentence.

422
00:27:16,118 --> 00:27:18,200
It's definitely not what you're thinking.

423
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,486
I haven't even considered anything

424
00:27:19,486 --> 00:27:20,994
and you've already confessed?

425
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,348
It seems you and 14th Prince

426
00:27:23,348 --> 00:27:24,802
have something going on.

427
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:28,120
I always thought that you were on good terms with 14th Brother and the others.

428
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:29,717
Giving gifts

429
00:27:29,717 --> 00:27:31,032
is not unusual.

430
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:34,151
But you're actually rejecting my assumptions.

431
00:27:34,151 --> 00:27:37,387
It's rare that you are so quick to clarify your actions.

432
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,521
I don't care what 14th Brother thinks

433
00:27:42,521 --> 00:27:43,542
and I don't care to monitor it.

434
00:27:44,471 --> 00:27:46,793
If you want to exchange gifts and laugh together, that's fine,

435
00:27:47,838 --> 00:27:49,951
but I don't want to see

436
00:27:49,951 --> 00:27:51,855
the crying and fighting between you like last time.

437
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:54,270
I understand.

438
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,920
Is there anything else?

439
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,880
No.

440
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:11,960
Timing and Subtitles brought to you by the Bu Bu Jing Xin Team @Viki.com

441
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:14,400
He's more generous than I had thought.

442
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:17,400
He didn't say any "don't do this" and "don't do that."

443
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:18,800
But,

444
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:21,000
that 14th Prince is truly detestable.

445
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,480
What's he trying to do?  Really.

446
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,640
Reporting to Your Majesty,

447
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:32,280
the investigation is complete and has uncovered something.

448
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:37,460
Speak, what was the result.

449
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:39,820
Everything that Zhengguo Gong reported was true.

450
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:41,700
There's evidence of a revolt.

451
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:43,700
Especially Qi Shiwu and Tou He'qi.

452
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:48,140
They tried to gather everyone to support the Crown Prince in taking over the throne.

453
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:52,700
Imperial Father,

454
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:56,300
I have always treated them as drinking pals. I had no idea of their intentions.

455
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:59,020
As for their plan to form a political faction...

456
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:00,700
and the details of their evil plot,

457
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:02,180
I know nothing about that.

458
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:04,140
I really didn't know.

459
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:05,660
If they are only your drinking pals,

460
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:08,500
that's normal.

461
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:10,340
But I'm afraid that their...

462
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:11,920
real intention isn't about drinking wine.

463
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:15,620
Qi Shiwu, Tou He'qi, Geng'e, and the rest,

464
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:19,060
are guilty of gathering their men...

465
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:21,460
in support of the Crown Prince.

466
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:24,820
They shall be thrown into jail and severely punished.

467
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:27,600
Investigate everybody involved in this case and...

468
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:28,980
do not let anyone escape punishment.

469
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:30,640
Yes.

470
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:56,820
- I'm innocent!
- Go. Behave yourself!

471
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:59,540
- Quickly.
- Let go!

472
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:01,500
Walk quickly!

473
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:02,380
Don't move!

474
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:04,460
No!

475
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:05,660
Hold him down.

476
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:07,020
Don't move.

477
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:09,660
Behave yourself. Don't move.

478
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:11,100
Don't move.

479
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:14,060
Hold him.

480
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:15,380
No, don't.

481
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:17,940
Behave yourself.

482
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:25,140
Greetings, Mistress.

483
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:26,260
Rise.

484
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:28,460
4th Prince has sent me with a letter for you.

485
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:32,900
Thank you for your trouble.

486
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:34,220
I will leave now.

487
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:50,040
[ Follow the path to the end of the water, ]

488
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:53,820
[ sit down and look at the clouds generate.]

489
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:34,420
Jie Jie, so many sheets of paper... are you practicing your writing?

490
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:36,720
Practicing your writing can help calm your emotions.

491
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,340
Try it.

492
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:41,540
Jie Jie, I can't read.

493
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:44,100
I'll teach you.

494
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:45,980
Jie Jie, I still have a lot of work to do.

495
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:47,940
I'll go now.

496
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:56,600
Is everything prepared?

497
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:58,260
It's almost done.

498
00:31:58,260 --> 00:31:59,580
Ruoxi Jie Jie.

499
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:02,580
With the pillow that contains chrysanthemums made by you,

500
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:05,020
I sleep much better.

501
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:06,580
That's good.

502
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:07,740
Is there anything else?

503
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:10,220
I came to give a message.

504
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:11,540
8th Bei'le Ye has returned.

505
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:13,520
Jie Jie needs to prepare one more cup of tea.

506
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:14,860
Alright.

507
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:04,203
You piece of trash!

508
00:33:04,203 --> 00:33:05,689
Where were you looking?

509
00:33:07,393 --> 00:33:08,986
Your servant deserves to die.

510
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:10,940
Rouxi?

511
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:12,900
Are you alright?

512
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:14,573
I'm fine.

513
00:33:14,573 --> 00:33:16,231
I'm not hurt anywhere that matters.

514
00:33:16,231 --> 00:33:18,335
I hope 10th Prince doesn't take offense.

515
00:33:18,335 --> 00:33:19,914
You come in and don't even greet anyone.

516
00:33:19,914 --> 00:33:21,075
You're bumping into everything,

517
00:33:21,075 --> 00:33:23,060
what's so urgent?

518
00:33:33,088 --> 00:33:34,460
Where's Imperial Father?

519
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:37,020
The Emperor is still taking a nap and has not woken up yet.

520
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:38,000
If 10th Prince could please wait a little while--

521
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:38,940
Where's the tea?

522
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:40,360
Don't you see the Princes are waiting?

523
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:43,060
Miss Ruoxi is currently preparing the tea, she'll return immediately.

524
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:45,040
Get out, all of you get out!

525
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:46,740
Yes.

526
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:49,460
10th Brother,

527
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:51,380
just what kind of fight gave you this injury?

528
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:53,440
Why are you using your hand to hide your face?

529
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,360
Unless,

530
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:57,020
fighting with women gives you a black eye?

531
00:33:58,060 --> 00:33:59,940
Even if I'm beaten by Imperial Father

532
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:02,140
I have to divorce that shrew!

533
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:04,120
Stop blocking your face with your hand.

534
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:05,180
Let me go!

535
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:07,420
Let me see just how bad it is.

536
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:09,780
How can you bring a personal matter

537
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:11,240
like this into the Imperial Palace?

538
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:12,785
Quickly, go back.

539
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:15,339
What was this about?

540
00:34:15,339 --> 00:34:16,980
Tell us.

541
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:19,500
We can help you reason it out.

542
00:34:21,850 --> 00:34:24,544
8th Brother, you judge it as a third party.

543
00:34:24,544 --> 00:34:25,726
During the Lantern Festival

544
00:34:25,726 --> 00:34:27,747
she saw I put up lots of lanterns in my study.

545
00:34:27,747 --> 00:34:28,820
So she just took them.

546
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:31,899
But today, I don't know what kind of rumors she heard,

547
00:34:31,899 --> 00:34:33,840
she came back and started arguing with me.

548
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:36,375
She even broke a lantern on top of my face!

549
00:34:36,375 --> 00:34:38,669
She asked me

550
00:34:38,669 --> 00:34:41,140
why I gave her things that other people had rejected last year?

551
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:44,220
I ... I ... Why should I waste my efforts to talk about this to her!

552
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:45,820
She just worked herself into a frenzy!

553
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:47,183
Tell me, tell me!

554
00:34:47,183 --> 00:34:49,940
Did you give me stuff that other people already rejected last year?

555
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:51,981
Does your heart even have me?

556
00:34:51,981 --> 00:34:53,188
Are you crazy?

557
00:34:53,188 --> 00:34:54,620
Are you done throwing a fit?

558
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:56,339
No! No! No! No! No!

559
00:34:56,339 --> 00:34:58,979
You... you...

560
00:34:58,979 --> 00:35:02,183
Your personality can't even compare to half of Ruoxi's!

561
00:35:03,244 --> 00:35:04,520
What?!

562
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:05,900
What?

563
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:10,780
Look!

564
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:13,064
Just look!

565
00:35:13,064 --> 00:35:14,754
Look closely!

566
00:35:14,754 --> 00:35:16,712
Look over here!

567
00:35:16,712 --> 00:35:18,398
I only said that her personality

568
00:35:18,398 --> 00:35:20,813
couldn't even compare to Ruoxi's.

569
00:35:20,813 --> 00:35:22,570
She just suddenly went crazy!

570
00:35:22,570 --> 00:35:24,335
She even... toward me...

571
00:35:24,335 --> 00:35:27,029
I don't care!  I'm going to divorce her!

572
00:35:27,029 --> 00:35:28,499
I'm going to divorce Gorolo

573
00:35:28,499 --> 00:35:30,163
Mingyu!

574
00:35:32,067 --> 00:35:33,368
10th Brother

575
00:35:33,368 --> 00:35:35,225
this isn't something you can divorce over.

576
00:35:36,084 --> 00:35:37,485
You should go back.

577
00:35:37,485 --> 00:35:40,125
I'll send her sister to talk with her.

578
00:35:40,125 --> 00:35:41,153
8th Brother!

579
00:35:41,153 --> 00:35:42,600
Don't plead with me.

580
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:45,837
Besides ... I've already decided.

581
00:35:46,696 --> 00:35:49,529
10th Brother, making a commotion like this isn't good.

582
00:35:49,529 --> 00:35:51,711
You even dragged Ruoxi, who hasn't done anything, into this.

583
00:35:51,711 --> 00:35:53,012
You better go back.

584
00:35:53,012 --> 00:35:54,823
I want to speak about this clearly with Imperial Father.

585
00:35:54,823 --> 00:35:55,898
I want to divorce her,

586
00:35:55,898 --> 00:35:57,006
because she's a broken piece of merchandise.

587
00:35:57,006 --> 00:35:59,374
What does that have to do with Ruoxi?

588
00:36:07,176 --> 00:36:08,816
10th Prince.

589
00:36:08,816 --> 00:36:10,543
Your servant is bold and has something to say.

590
00:36:10,543 --> 00:36:11,711
No one is to try and persuade me.

591
00:36:11,711 --> 00:36:13,340
I've already made my decision.

592
00:36:14,351 --> 00:36:16,176
I'm not planning on persuading you.

593
00:36:16,176 --> 00:36:18,530
I only have a question.

594
00:36:18,530 --> 00:36:19,836
10th Prince,

595
00:36:19,836 --> 00:36:21,154
when you were hit by your wife,

596
00:36:21,154 --> 00:36:22,222
did you retaliate?

597
00:36:22,222 --> 00:36:23,244
I didn't.

598
00:36:23,244 --> 00:36:24,126
Why not?

599
00:36:24,126 --> 00:36:26,588
I'm certainly not going to fight with women.

600
00:36:27,981 --> 00:36:29,514
When your temper flares up,

601
00:36:29,514 --> 00:36:32,453
how is it you can remember not to raise your hand to women?

602
00:36:32,453 --> 00:36:34,250
Even if it was a child

603
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:37,408
you would hit him first and then control your temper.

604
00:36:39,266 --> 00:36:42,795
When I was young,  I especially loved to eat candied haws.

605
00:36:42,795 --> 00:36:45,164
I thought it was a little sour, a little sweet, and crunchy.

606
00:36:45,164 --> 00:36:47,997
I ate it it from time to time so I thought it was quite novel.

607
00:36:47,997 --> 00:36:51,433
But later, my father thought it was dirty and wouldn't buy it for me.

608
00:36:51,433 --> 00:36:54,684
But I couldn't forget the taste of candied haws.

609
00:36:54,684 --> 00:36:58,213
I kept thinking that was the best thing in the world.

610
00:36:58,213 --> 00:37:01,139
I usually ate lotus cakes,

611
00:37:01,139 --> 00:37:04,822
but I always thought that candied haws were even better.

612
00:37:04,822 --> 00:37:08,616
Later, I finally was able to eat candied haws again.

613
00:37:08,616 --> 00:37:10,799
10th Prince, can you guess

614
00:37:10,799 --> 00:37:12,842
what I felt then?

615
00:37:14,142 --> 00:37:16,093
You were extremely happy of course.

616
00:37:16,929 --> 00:37:19,483
Wrong. It was such a disappointment.

617
00:37:19,483 --> 00:37:21,248
An extreme disappointment.

618
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:24,820
What I felt was that

619
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:26,658
even though it wasn't bad tasting,

620
00:37:26,658 --> 00:37:28,980
it certainly was not better than lotus cakes.

621
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:32,393
I then thought what could taste better than lotus cakes?

622
00:37:32,393 --> 00:37:35,226
I then didn't eat lotus cakes for three months.

623
00:37:35,226 --> 00:37:36,759
I was craving them like crazy.

624
00:37:36,759 --> 00:37:38,198
That's how I knew

625
00:37:38,198 --> 00:37:39,963
that what I really loved best

626
00:37:39,963 --> 00:37:41,728
was lotus cakes.

627
00:37:42,447 --> 00:37:43,330
10th Prince.

628
00:37:43,330 --> 00:37:46,302
In actuality, I am candied haw

629
00:37:46,302 --> 00:37:49,042
and 10th Fujin is lotus cake.

630
00:37:49,042 --> 00:37:51,875
The lotus cake is always an arm's length away.

631
00:37:51,875 --> 00:37:54,940
After a while, you don't think much of it.

632
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:57,912
But the candied haw because you've always been unable to attain it,

633
00:37:57,912 --> 00:37:59,305
it stays in your memory

634
00:37:59,305 --> 00:38:01,220
as something far better than the lotus cake.

635
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:04,460
But if one day... you're really deprived of the lotus cake

636
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:05,900
then you will discover

637
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:09,383
that what you truly love is lotus cake.

638
00:38:17,370 --> 00:38:19,692
Why did 10th Prince not fight back?

639
00:38:19,692 --> 00:38:21,178
Even if you were angry,

640
00:38:21,178 --> 00:38:24,336
your heart held you back and you couldn't bear to hit.

641
00:38:25,869 --> 00:38:30,466
I'm not going to talk with you!  I know I can't out talk you!  You...

642
00:38:30,466 --> 00:38:32,092
Ruoxi!

643
00:38:32,835 --> 00:38:35,110
Let him think about it by himself.

644
00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:37,154
This many years of longing

645
00:38:37,154 --> 00:38:39,568
is not something to be unraveled so suddenly.

646
00:38:39,568 --> 00:38:40,472
Besides,

647
00:38:40,472 --> 00:38:43,584
he's as obstinate as a mule.

648
00:38:47,445 --> 00:38:49,782
I'll take my leave now.

649
00:38:59,777 --> 00:39:01,217
How is it like this?  Is it serious?

650
00:39:01,217 --> 00:39:03,121
I'm not sure. After I served the tea, I came back immediately.

651
00:39:03,121 --> 00:39:05,110
Yunxiang, serve tea in my place.

652
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:06,271
Yes.

653
00:39:15,838 --> 00:39:17,881
Jie Jie, does it still hurt?

654
00:39:17,881 --> 00:39:19,939
It's fine.

655
00:39:19,939 --> 00:39:23,640
I'll apply something.  In a few days it'll be better.

656
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:25,846
10th Prince is really something.

657
00:39:25,846 --> 00:39:28,164
How could he raise his hand to you?

658
00:39:28,164 --> 00:39:30,618
You know of this?

659
00:39:30,618 --> 00:39:32,162
Yunxiang told me everything.

660
00:39:32,162 --> 00:39:33,601
Ruoxi Jie Jie.

661
00:39:34,437 --> 00:39:36,309
Ruoxi Jie Jie.

662
00:39:36,309 --> 00:39:38,199
The Emperor wants to see you.

663
00:39:51,295 --> 00:39:53,606
Your servant greets Your Majesty.

664
00:39:53,606 --> 00:39:55,853
Ruo'xi, tell me

665
00:39:55,853 --> 00:39:58,168
just what happened earlier.

666
00:39:58,168 --> 00:39:59,947
What is 10th Prince doing?

667
00:39:59,947 --> 00:40:03,787
He runs into people and throws cups.

668
00:40:06,295 --> 00:40:08,397
10th Prince and 10th Fujin were fighting.

669
00:40:08,397 --> 00:40:11,512
He was angry and so wanted to come to the Emperor.

670
00:40:11,512 --> 00:40:14,134
But after persuading him a little, he returned home.

671
00:40:14,134 --> 00:40:15,885
This I already know.

672
00:40:15,885 --> 00:40:20,157
But what did they fight about and how was he persuaded to go back?

673
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:23,933
The reason for 10th Prince and 10th Fujin's argument

674
00:40:23,933 --> 00:40:27,727
were some rumors from many years ago.

675
00:40:27,727 --> 00:40:29,631
10th Fujin has always misunderstood.

676
00:40:29,631 --> 00:40:32,139
It involved me so...

677
00:40:32,139 --> 00:40:35,529
I boldly inserted myself.

678
00:40:35,529 --> 00:40:37,363
Back then, you liked 10th Prince.

679
00:40:37,363 --> 00:40:39,871
This matter, inside the capital

680
00:40:39,871 --> 00:40:42,014
was abuzz with it.

681
00:40:42,014 --> 00:40:45,165
This is the gossip you're referring to?

682
00:40:45,165 --> 00:40:46,991
I didn't, your Majesty!

683
00:40:46,991 --> 00:40:48,773
That was pure gossip.

684
00:40:48,773 --> 00:40:50,784
10th Prince and I were platonic.

685
00:40:50,784 --> 00:40:52,224
It was only because

686
00:40:52,224 --> 00:40:54,639
10th Prince felt like he really liked talking with me

687
00:40:54,639 --> 00:40:57,100
and so he frequently spent time with me.

688
00:40:57,100 --> 00:41:01,087
But most of the time 9th Prince, 13th Prince, and 14th Prince were also there.

689
00:41:01,087 --> 00:41:04,206
I had no feelings for 10th Prince.

690
00:41:06,985 --> 00:41:08,239
Really?

691
00:41:08,239 --> 00:41:10,243
Really!

692
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:14,376
Continue.

693
00:41:14,376 --> 00:41:16,280
10th Fujin believed the gossip.

694
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:17,952
I explained it to 10th Prince

695
00:41:17,952 --> 00:41:19,949
but he wouldn't listen.

696
00:41:19,949 --> 00:41:22,549
10th Prince and I both know that gossip is a fearful thing,

697
00:41:22,549 --> 00:41:25,675
so ever since 10th Prince and 10th Fujin were married,

698
00:41:25,675 --> 00:41:28,865
I've never seen 10th Prince privately again.

699
00:41:28,865 --> 00:41:30,955
But this thing, the argument got out of hand.

700
00:41:30,955 --> 00:41:33,509
Why is that?

701
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:35,706
It's because

702
00:41:35,706 --> 00:41:37,749
after the Lantern Festival, 10th Prince

703
00:41:37,749 --> 00:41:40,289
gave me a lantern...

704
00:41:41,954 --> 00:41:42,844
...Your Majesty,

705
00:41:42,844 --> 00:41:44,423
It was all a misunderstanding.

706
00:41:44,423 --> 00:41:46,001
There is nothing happening between us and your servant wouldn't dare

707
00:41:46,001 --> 00:41:50,645
to have any improper or "over stepping boundary" thoughts.

708
00:41:51,551 --> 00:41:52,805
Rise.

709
00:41:57,681 --> 00:41:59,181
Ruoxi.

710
00:41:59,181 --> 00:42:01,907
You've explained everything clearly.

711
00:42:01,907 --> 00:42:04,697
I don't know if in the future you can

712
00:42:04,697 --> 00:42:06,480
forget about your disappointments

713
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:08,734
and appreciate what you have.

714
00:42:10,382 --> 00:42:12,658
I don't know.

715
00:42:14,144 --> 00:42:15,537
You may leave.

716
00:42:24,547 --> 00:42:26,915
I don't know if in the future you can

717
00:42:26,915 --> 00:42:28,680
forget your disappointments

718
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:30,677
and appreciate what you have.

719
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:37,589
Follow the path to the end of water,

720
00:42:37,589 --> 00:42:40,336
sit down and watch clouds generate.

721
00:42:43,441 --> 00:42:45,345
In such beautiful surroundings,

722
00:42:45,345 --> 00:42:49,160
it would be wonderful to be able to share it with a beauty.

723
00:42:50,321 --> 00:42:51,853
Suddenly, I met with a Lin elder,

724
00:42:51,853 --> 00:42:53,990
laughing and chatting and did not want to return.

725
00:44:03,928 --> 00:44:05,228
What are you writing?

726
00:44:05,228 --> 00:44:08,015
It's nothing.  I'm just practicing my writing.

727
00:44:08,356 --> 00:44:10,081
You're working this hard?

728
00:44:11,514 --> 00:44:12,821
Let me see.

729
00:44:24,460 --> 00:44:26,939
Is it really ugly?

730
00:44:28,286 --> 00:44:30,283
You've practiced many times?

731
00:44:33,728 --> 00:44:36,250
Did 10th Brother kick you hard?

732
00:44:36,250 --> 00:44:38,015
It was only a light tap.

733
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:39,965
It didn't hit anything important.

734
00:44:40,555 --> 00:44:42,169
There's something

735
00:44:42,169 --> 00:44:44,131
I hope that you can promise me.

736
00:44:44,131 --> 00:44:45,561
What is it?

737
00:44:46,383 --> 00:44:48,394
From today onward

738
00:44:48,394 --> 00:44:50,995
never lie to me,

739
00:44:50,995 --> 00:44:53,067
because I'm the same as you.

740
00:44:53,067 --> 00:44:55,500
I'd rather hear the ugly truth

741
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:58,704
than to have you lie to decieve me.

742
00:45:02,412 --> 00:45:04,370
Then can you promise me also

743
00:45:04,370 --> 00:45:07,017
to never lie to me?

744
00:45:07,551 --> 00:45:09,640
You really calculate things very clearly.

745
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:11,962
You can't even let others gain any advantage.

746
00:45:14,131 --> 00:45:15,631
Then I'll ask you.

747
00:45:15,631 --> 00:45:17,210
10th Brother kicked you.

748
00:45:17,210 --> 00:45:19,602
Why haven't I seen you get back at him?

749
00:45:22,202 --> 00:45:23,596
Also,

750
00:45:23,596 --> 00:45:24,524
in Manchuria,

751
00:45:24,524 --> 00:45:27,613
you risked your own life to protect 14th Brother.

752
00:45:27,613 --> 00:45:30,538
These matters, how will you ask for repayment?

753
00:45:31,699 --> 00:45:33,511
I only get even with smart people.

754
00:45:33,511 --> 00:45:34,625
With confused people,

755
00:45:34,625 --> 00:45:36,483
I become confused too.

756
00:45:39,223 --> 00:45:40,244
If I agree to promise you

757
00:45:40,244 --> 00:45:42,009
then will you agree to promise me?

758
00:45:45,074 --> 00:45:46,867
I promise you.

759
00:45:46,867 --> 00:45:48,432
Why?

760
00:45:48,432 --> 00:45:49,850
No particular reason

761
00:45:49,850 --> 00:45:51,683
except I ought to.

762
00:45:51,683 --> 00:45:53,101
What if there are some things

763
00:45:53,101 --> 00:45:54,673
I'm not willing to talk about,

764
00:45:54,673 --> 00:45:56,266
then what?

765
00:45:57,334 --> 00:46:00,167
You can tell me directly that you don't want to talk about it.

766
00:46:00,903 --> 00:46:03,975
But never lie to deceive me.

767
00:46:05,083 --> 00:46:07,730
Then there's something I want to ask you.

768
00:46:07,730 --> 00:46:10,059
You can choose not to reply.

(Royal Throne)

770
00:46:41,134 --> 00:46:42,660
Do you want it?
