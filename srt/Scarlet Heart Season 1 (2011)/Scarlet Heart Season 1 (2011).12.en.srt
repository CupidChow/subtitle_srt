♫  We were destined to seek our doom like moths flying towards the flame  ♫

♫  Only like this can I not be in love with you  ♫

7
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:47,660
♫  Just another brushing of the shoulder, and from then...♫

8

Scarlet Heart
Episode 12

24
00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:11,868
It isn´t hot enough

25
00:02:11,868 --> 00:02:13,856
What I want is for it to be boiling hot.

26
00:02:13,856 --> 00:02:16,170
Baozhu, I'll need you to endure some grievances today.

27
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:17,520
Listen well.

28
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,422
Master, please give your orders.

29
00:02:19,422 --> 00:02:21,070
When Crown Prince comes in later,

30
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:24,400
you need to accidentally spill the tea on my shoulder.

31
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,574
You must make sure that I'll be scalded.

32
00:02:26,574 --> 00:02:29,640
As for how to do it in a natural and believable way,

33
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,920
figure it out yourself.

34
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,511
Understand?

35
00:02:32,511 --> 00:02:34,283
Your servant understands.

36
00:02:34,949 --> 00:02:36,628
You may go out.

37
00:02:45,762 --> 00:02:47,890
You'd better go back first.

38
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,204
Greetings to Crown Prince.

39
00:03:05,204 --> 00:03:06,600
Excused.

40
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,998
Who'd have thought

41
00:03:07,998 --> 00:03:10,200
that Miss Ruoxi would be here.

42
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,560
I remember now,

43
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,800
your Jiejie is Eighth Brother's Fujin.

44
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,540
It's only right for you to be closer to each other.

45
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:17,800
Before I entered the palace,

46
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,020
I previously stayed at Eighth Prince's residence for a good part of a year,

47
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:22,400
I knew that Eighth Prince has medicine for bruises that's pretty good,

48
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,220
so I specially came here to get some.

49
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:27,840
What happened to your hands?

50
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,400
It's nothing much. When I went horseback riding in the afternoon,

51
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,440
I accidentally pulled too hard on the reins.

52
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,480
I have some pretty good medicine for bruises at my place.

53
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,240
I'll get someone to send it over to you later.

54
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,440
Thank you, Crown Prince, for your gift.

55
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,540
Miss, how long have you been here?

56
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:43,680
Because I was chatting a little with Eighth Prince,

57
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,780
it's been quite a while.

58
00:03:47,713 --> 00:03:49,160
I didn't know that the Crown Prince was coming,

59
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,880
I'm late in welcoming your arrival.

60
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:53,260
Rise.

61
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,360
It's just that I was bored today,

62
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,220
so I came here for a casual visit.

63
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:58,960
No need to stand on ceremony so much.

64
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,000
Crown Prince, please come into the tent.

65
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,980
Your servant deserves to die! Your servant deserves to die!

66
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:34,720
Lowly servant! Is this how you do your job?

67
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,140
You can't even serve tea properly!

68
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:37,660
- Come men!
- Yes!

69
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:39,720
- Drag him out and have him paddled!
- Let's go!

70
00:04:42,266 --> 00:04:43,240
Let's go!

71
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:43,980
- Master, spare my life!
- Let's go!

72
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:46,195
Come men! Summon the imperial physician!

73
00:04:46,195 --> 00:04:47,680
Say that Bei'le has been scalded by tea!

74
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,920
Spare my life!

75
00:04:58,107 --> 00:05:00,600
Eighth Brother, is it serious?

76
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,480
Thank you for your concern.

77
00:05:26,802 --> 00:05:29,520
Miss Ruoxi just came to get medicine for wounds,

78
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,600
and right after that, Eighth Brother is scalded.

79
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:34,700
Isn't this too coincidental?

80
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,780
That lass has been careless since young.

81
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:40,200
She actually even led my residence's servants astray,

82
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,000
and gave you a scare.

83
00:05:58,340 --> 00:05:59,760
Eighth Brother,

84
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,780
you still love reading so much?

85
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:03,980
I was bored and had nothing to do tonight.

86
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:06,920
I didn't think that I'd read so much of it.

87
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,560
Oh yes!

88
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,540
Just now, it sounded very noisy outside.

89
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:14,680
The servants told me that there were Mongolian thieves around.

90
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,351
Have you found them?

91
00:06:17,134 --> 00:06:18,225
Just the mention of this,

92
00:06:18,225 --> 00:06:20,041
makes me so mad.

93
00:06:20,041 --> 00:06:21,342
So many guards,

94
00:06:21,342 --> 00:06:23,556
and they couldn't even catch a thief.

95
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,939
Forget it!

96
00:06:25,939 --> 00:06:27,620
Eighth Brother is hurt, you should have an early rest.

97
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,340
It's time that I leave too.

98
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:31,265
Dispense with ceremony.

99
00:06:40,136 --> 00:06:42,980
Master, judging from the Crown Prince's expression,

100
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:44,880
he seems to have suspicions about you.

101
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,880
Will he report this to His Majesty?

102
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,500
He shot the arrow in the dark.

103
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:52,040
Naturally, he wouldn't be able to guess who was shot.

104
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,900
There's no need to worry.

105
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,420
Since he wasn't able to nab anyone,

106
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:58,040
he doesn't dare aver that the Mongolian thief is Fourteenth Brother.

107
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:00,160
If he alarms Imperial Father,

108
00:07:00,694 --> 00:07:02,880
there's nothing to gain on his side.

109
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,800
Be careful!

110
00:07:17,838 --> 00:07:19,960
No!

111
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:39,000
Jiejie, what's the matter?

112
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,080
I had a dream.

113
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:44,520
Why don't I accompany you to sleep?

114
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,660
No need.

115
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:48,760
It's fine. Hurry and go to sleep.

116
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,320
Then I'll go back first.

117
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,920
Call me if there's anything.

118
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,560
You have me in your heart.

119
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,560
I really am in your heart.

120
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,800
Originally, I thought I could distance myself.

121
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,780
Even while knowing the outcome, I couldn't have been so foolish

122
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:32,540
as to resolutely continue down the path.

123
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:35,140
But for these past few years,

124
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,720
all the bits and pieces,

125
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,660
were like the bracelet on my wrist,

126
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:40,759
they've become similar to shadows, following me around,

127
00:08:40,759 --> 00:08:44,540
and have become a part of my life.

128
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,520
Whether or not history can be changed.

129
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:14,680
Maertai Ruoxi, it's up to you now.

130
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,320
Imperial Father, that lowly servant

131
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,000
actually couldn't even walk steadily.

132
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,380
He just went off balance just like that,

133
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:25,900
and spilled a whole cup of hot tea on Eighth Brother's arm.

134
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:27,240
In my opinion,

135
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,920
anyone who dares to scald a prince,

136
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,500
giving him twenty strokes of the paddle,

137
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,120
that's too light!

138
00:09:34,564 --> 00:09:37,400
Then, what did the Imperial Physician say after looking at it?

139
00:09:39,347 --> 00:09:40,680
It's just a regular scald.

140
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,923
It's not as serious as the Crown Prince made it out to be.

141
00:09:42,923 --> 00:09:44,760
I've made Imperial Father worry.

142
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,260
Then for these few days, there's no need for you to tag along by my side.

143
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:48,640
Rest well.

144
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,441
You may go.

145
00:09:49,441 --> 00:09:52,440
Thank you, Imperial Father. I'll take my leave.

146
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,320
Last night,

147
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,001
did you manage to catch that horse thief?

148
00:10:08,001 --> 00:10:09,640
Was anything lost?

149
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,000
Nothing.

150
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,880
But, since it was discovered in a timely manner,

151
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,120
nothing's gone missing either.

152
00:10:16,801 --> 00:10:17,800
Then do you know

153
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,240
that the Mongolians are very unhappy?

154
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,160
The horse thief that you talked about was garbed in Mongolian attire,

155
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:26,080
yet nothing was found on the campsite grounds.

156
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,160
I acted in haste,

157
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,600
and didn't give sufficient consideration to all factors.

158
00:10:29,154 --> 00:10:31,040
I hope that Imperial Father will punish me.

159
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,760
In the future, when dealing with matters,

160
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,960
you need to think carefully before acting.

161
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,520
Yes.

162
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,480
Are you going to drink or not?

163
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:08,960
It's still worth it.

164
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,360
At least he's really happy now.

165
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,080
I will bring a book for you.

166
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,360
I don't want to read anything,

167
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,200
I just want you to keep me company.

168
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,520
I'm on duty today.

169
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:24,120
I still have to return to prepare tea and snacks.

170
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,480
Otherwise, when the Emperor returns, what is he going to drink?

171
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,520
Besides,

172
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,720
I still want to check on Fourteenth Prince.

173
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,800
I will stay for a bit

174
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:41,320
This wish to have you will willingly keep me company and just sit with me,

175
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:43,411
I've already wished for it for a long time.

176
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,520
I really should go.

177
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,240
If I still don't let you leave,

178
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,760
you won't dare to come again the next time.

179
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,120
Go then.

180
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,360
Don't go to see Fourteenth Brother yet.

181
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,800
He's at Minmin's and is very safe.

182
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:09,760
Wait for a few days,

183
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,320
until the Crown Prince doesn't pay that much attention, before you visit him.

184
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,680
If you guys are already done discussing your matters,

185
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,320
why not let him leave earlier?

186
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,960
That would be the safest plan.

187
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,880
Although we're more or less done discussing,

188
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,560
right now, the Crown Prince must be thinking,

189
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:22,920
since the campsite has been searched,

190
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,040
and he still isn't able to find anyone.

191
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,920
Then if it really was Fourteenth Brother,

192
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,960
he would definitely do all he could to return to the capital.

193
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:33,240
The Crown Prince must have sent men to be on the look out and intercept him around the boundaries.

194
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,560
Why don't we wait for a few more days,

195
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,720
until the Crown Prince's suspicions have been completely set aside, before he leaves?

196
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,480
That would be more advisable instead.

197
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,320
I'll wait for you tonight.

198
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,280
Miss Ruoxi, take care.

199
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,880
Let me do my best to love him,

200
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:04,800
and let him fall in love with me wholeheartedly too.

201
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:03,600
Tell me more!

202
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,840
You were childhood sweethearts, who knew each other from young.

203
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:08,080
It can't be that you guys just have these little shared memories?

204
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,400
Princess,

205
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,840
things that I should have said and things that I shouldn't have said,

206
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,680
I've already told you them all.

207
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,840
I don't believe it!

208
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:15,880
If you don't tell me,

209
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:18,440
when Ruoxi comes, I'll ask her in person!

210
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,280
All right. All right.

211
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,840
Ruoxi is going to be here soon.

212
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,760
Hurry and tidy your appearance.

213
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,040
Draw a basin of hot water for me!

214
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:26,960
Yes.

215
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,640
No need to go through all that trouble.

216
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:30,360
Why are you being so polite with me?

217
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,360
Later, if Ruoxi sees you in such a scruffy state,

218
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,840
she's going to blame me for not taking care of you again.

219
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:37,880
Princess, the water is here.

220
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:38,800
Give it to him.

221
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:39,920
Yes.

222
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,960
Thank you. I can do it myself.

223
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,000
Why do you wash your face this way?

224
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,400
Princess, there's something you don't know.

225
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,880
Recently, my skin has been sensitive,

226
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,640
so I can only wash lightly.

227
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:04,480
Are you all right?

228
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,200
- Let me take a look!
- I'm fine.

229
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,760
- I'm fine.
- Let me take a look!

230
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,320
Don't walk away.

231
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,840
Let me take a look!

232
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:10,720
I can't see!

233
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,920
It's nothing.

234
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,420
What are you doing?

235
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:18,520
I can't see. Lower the cloth.

236
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,160
What are you doing?

237
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:20,840
Princess,

238
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:23,600
Miss Ruoxi says that she isn't free today and won't be able to come anymore.

239
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,680
She'll come over another day to greet you.

240
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,280
You may take your leave.

241
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,400
Yes.

242
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:31,440
What's she busy with, that it takes up the whole day?

243
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:36,280
Perhaps it's because she was serving His Majesty today and was too exhausted.

244
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:41,240
Then tell me some more about you and Ruoxi!

245
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,480
All right.

246
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,269
Hurry up!

247
00:16:00,883 --> 00:16:02,520
Eighth Prince.

248
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:12,280
I'm a man who loves you.

249
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,480
It's inconvenient for you to move your arm,

250
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,600
why are you still playing with this?

251
00:16:17,082 --> 00:16:20,216
It's just moving my fingers. I'm not using strength, it's fine.

252
00:16:20,216 --> 00:16:23,096
Besides, the burn isn't serious.

253
00:16:23,096 --> 00:16:25,160
Is Baozhu all right?

254
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:28,600
Just some paddles with the stick, he's able to withstand that.

255
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:31,600
I will read for you.

256
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,600
Sure.

257
00:16:35,356 --> 00:16:36,720
Ruoxi,

258
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,560
tell me.

259
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,961
When did you change your mind

260
00:16:40,961 --> 00:16:43,580
and start accepting me?

261
00:16:45,851 --> 00:16:48,960
Eighth Prince, that isn't important.

262
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,460
What's important is

263
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:52,960
I have already made a decision.

264
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:56,280
Which book do you want to listen to?

265
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,240
Anything is fine.

266
00:17:24,399 --> 00:17:26,480
Use more strength!

267
00:17:28,824 --> 00:17:32,280
King, Princess Minmin really is a direct person.

268
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,120
Your Majesty must be laughing at us.

269
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,500
Since young, Minmin has been spoiled by me.

270
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,040
Regarding the word "rules,"

271
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:43,360
she knows how to read and write them, yet she doesn't know how to follow them.

272
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:46,760
That's how the daughter of the grassland should be.

273
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,940
It's my son, on the other hand, who's unmannered.

274
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:51,719
He even went all the way to the Mongolian camp to catch thieves.

275
00:17:51,719 --> 00:17:53,160
He was too reckless.

276
00:17:54,954 --> 00:17:57,320
That day, I was worried about

277
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:59,560
Imperial Father and His Highness's safety.

278
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:02,560
I feared that there were outlaws who'd broken into the two campsites.

279
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:05,080
In a moment of anxiety, I did the wrong thing.

280
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:08,120
I hope Your Highness does not take this to heart.

281
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,820
The Crown Prince's words are too serious.

282
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:16,040
For His Majesty's safety, we should be more cautious.

283
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:19,360
We shouldn't let up on any suspicious traces.

284
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:23,480
This apology should be made.

285
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:27,840
Crown Prince, you must take this lesson to heart.

286
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,320
I will keep that in mind.

287
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:48,560
Hating myself for only being able to roam the countryside.

288
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:55,640
Expressing emotions through the seven-stringed zither,

289
00:18:55,640 --> 00:19:00,760
while silently watching the swan goose fly home.

290
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,760
Ruoxi, Ruoxi!

291
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,140
See! I'm nice to you, aren't I?

292
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:06,060
He said that back then, you sang for him,

293
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:07,580
and that's how he fell for you.

294
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:09,440
Now, I forced him to sing for you.

295
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,040
This can be considered as helping you gain back some face.

296
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:18,280
Princess, you asked me to sing for you, and I've done so.

297
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,580
Now that Ruoxi is here,

298
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:21,634
can you let the both of us be alone for a bit,

299
00:19:21,634 --> 00:19:23,360
so as to ease our yearning since we haven't seen each other for so many days?

300
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,303
You really can't wait a moment longer.

301
00:19:25,721 --> 00:19:28,437
Fine. I'm leaving. Have a nice talk.

302
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,800
It's all thanks to you this time.

303
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,068
How long have we known each other?

304
00:19:37,068 --> 00:19:38,422
Given so many years of friendship,

305
00:19:38,422 --> 00:19:41,000
if you thank me again, it'll feel like we're distant.

306
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,580
Besides, even if I weren't here,

307
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:45,520
your men would also ensure your safety.

308
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,560
I just happened to be around at the right time.

309
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,640
I heard that Eighth Brother's arm was scalded, is that true?

310
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:54,800
He wants to meet you later.

311
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,160
Why don't you ask him yourself?

312
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,420
Where are we meeting?

313
00:19:57,420 --> 00:20:00,040
The forest on the east of the Mongolian campsite.

314
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:02,400
All right. I got it.

315
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:06,520
Then be careful. Make it a fast trip.

316
00:20:17,294 --> 00:20:19,080
Why is he going out?

317
00:20:20,118 --> 00:20:22,440
He will be returning to the capital in a few days,

318
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,680
and wants to bid farewell to some good friends,

319
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:27,160
and thank them for taking care of me normally.

320
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:29,560
Teach me how to sing opera.

321
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,880
Sure.

322
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,900
Does Thirteenth Prince like to listen to opera?

323
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,200
He likes them.

324
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,860
Thirteenth Prince is musically inclined;

325
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:40,020
he's especially versed at playing the zither and the flute.

326
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:43,440
Among the young lords of the capital, he's very famous.

327
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,840
I really wish I could listen to him play the zither and flute.

328
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,260
Ruoxi, hurry and tell me.

329
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:50,160
What kinds of tunes does Thirteenth Prince like to play the best?

330
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,240
Who does he play for?

331
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:55,040
I've never heard him play either.

332
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,640
If there is an expedition next year

333
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,380
and both you and Thirteenth Prince are around,

334
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:03,620
I'll definitely ask him to play a tune for you.

335
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:04,820
Really?

336
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:08,920
Are you very close to Thirteenth Prince?

337
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,960
I've known him since I was a youth;

338
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,120
we're just like siblings.

339
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:18,200
I really envy you, to be able to be so close to Thirteenth Prince.

340
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:21,080
I promise you.

341
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:25,240
I will definitely let you hear Thirteenth Prince personally perform a tune for you.

342
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:29,840
I really hope that I can be like his wife,

343
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:32,000
and keep listening to him playing tunes.

344
00:21:35,102 --> 00:21:36,520
Could it be,

345
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,960
Princess, you're really willing to share a husband with another woman?

346
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,640
Why do you say that?

347
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,320
Since ancient times, capable men have had multitudes of wives.

348
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:46,120
Don't tell me that there'd be a husband and a wife who just have each other their whole life?

349
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:48,240
This is the way it should have been.

350
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,760
Otherwise, it isn't good for everyone.

351
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:53,900
Do you not approve of me getting together with Thirteenth Prince.

352
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:56,000
That's not what I meant.

353
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,200
I just feel that

354
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,120
as a girl,

355
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:03,560
if she wholeheartedly loves a person,

356
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:07,040
of course she'd also hope that the other party would do the same for her.

357
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:10,340
I don't have as many thoughts as you do.

358
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:11,700
I just feel that

359
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:13,960
if two people who love each other can be together,

360
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:16,560
then there's no need to fuss so much.

361
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,380
Eighth Brother!

362
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:30,600
I heard that your arm was scalded, is that so?

363
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,120
We must definitely suffer a little,

364
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:34,020
only then will it get the Crown Prince to give up.

365
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,680
Compared to you risking your life to come here,

366
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:38,360
this little injury is nothing.

367
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:41,320
Fourteenth Brother, thanks so much.

368
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:43,260
Eighth Brother, why are you so courteous?

369
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:45,660
We are brothers, do we need to be so polite?

370
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,802
It's all thanks to you that important matters weren't delayed.

371
00:22:49,624 --> 00:22:52,560
On these last few days, the Crown Prince has been reprimanded by Imperial Father,

372
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:55,480
and seems to have already given up on catching the thief.

373
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:58,000
You need to return to the capital as quickly as you can too,

374
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,960
so as to avoid those in the capital discovering something's amiss.

375
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:04,560
I can finally return to the capital.

376
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:06,320
These last two days, accompanying Princess Minmin

377
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,260
really has been taxing for my body and brain.

378
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:09,540
Oh yes, Eighth Brother,

379
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:11,760
at this time, regarding Fourth Brother's re-assignment of the officials in the capital,

380
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,880
Eighth Brother, do you have a counter measure?

381
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,680
I know what he's thinking.

382
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:18,440
I will take everything into careful consideration.

383
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,760
You can relax and return to the capital.

384
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,600
It's not convenient for me to stay long here either.

385
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:23,840
You need to hurry and go back too,

386
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:26,640
in case Princess Minmin gets suspicious.

387
00:23:31,402 --> 00:23:34,740
Eighth Brother, this time Ruoxi and I pretended to be a couple,

388
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:35,940
but Princess Minmin said

389
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:38,000
that looking at Ruoxi's expression and behaviour,

390
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,800
she's definitely a woman in love.

391
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:44,200
You can change the way you address her and start calling her sister-in-law.

392
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,480
Then I must congratulate Eighth Brother.

393
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:49,160
All right. Hurry and return.

394
00:23:57,192 --> 00:23:59,440
Greetings to Sister-in-law.

395
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,920
What are you doing?

396
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,040
From this moment on,

397
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:04,760
I should be the one giving you greetings instead.

398
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,180
Eighth Brother's dream has finally come true.

399
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:09,340
When are you leaving?

400
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:10,880
Tomorrow night.

401
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:15,280
I can finally get rid of this beard of mine,

402
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:17,640
and regain my handsome good looks.

403
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:20,520
If you want to be handsome, wait until you're back in the capital.

404
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,580
Let me tell you.

405
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:24,480
Stop fabricating ridiculous stories to bluff Princess Minmin.

406
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,460
Come that time, I won't be able to patch the lies.

407
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:29,080
Right now, she already wants to learn to sing opera from me.

408
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:30,784
You, Go-All-Out Thirteenth Sister,

409
00:24:30,784 --> 00:24:32,120
you're still scared of this?

410
00:24:33,457 --> 00:24:37,054
Sister-in-law, please spare me.

411
00:24:42,791 --> 00:24:46,388
I once thought that if I knew history's path, I'd be able to seek fortune and avoid calamity,

412
00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:52,360
but in the end, step by step, I've still become helplessly embroiled in it.

413
00:24:56,746 --> 00:24:58,579
What are we still waiting for?

414
00:24:59,415 --> 00:25:01,597
Princess, you'll find out in a moment.

415
00:25:03,425 --> 00:25:04,778
Princess, don't worry.

416
00:25:04,778 --> 00:25:06,120
Eighth Prince knows about us.

417
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:07,751
Bei'le.

418
00:25:08,333 --> 00:25:10,040
You really must be honoured,

419
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:13,040
to have me and Bei'le to send you off.

420
00:25:13,147 --> 00:25:14,090
You flatter me.

421
00:25:14,493 --> 00:25:15,520
If you're really sincere,

422
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:19,059
when you get back, think of a way to ask for Ruoxi's hand in marriage.

423
00:25:21,706 --> 00:25:23,000
Look at how troubled she looks,

424
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,864
even I'm worried for her.

425
00:25:28,393 --> 00:25:29,508
I shan't delay anymore,

426
00:25:29,508 --> 00:25:30,622
it's time I leave too.

427
00:25:30,622 --> 00:25:33,280
I'll remember this debt of gratitude this time.

428
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:36,149
Bei'le, we'll meet again.

429
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:47,387
Princess,

430
00:25:47,387 --> 00:25:49,175
if one day, I committed a mistake,

431
00:25:49,175 --> 00:25:51,218
would you forgive me?

432
00:25:51,218 --> 00:25:53,680
Would you still treat me like you do now?

433
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,000
I don't know,

434
00:25:56,166 --> 00:25:58,388
I'd have to see what mistake you committed.

435
00:25:58,388 --> 00:26:00,749
What kinds of thing would you do that would let me down?

436
00:26:00,749 --> 00:26:02,893
Nothing, it was just a random question.

437
00:26:02,893 --> 00:26:04,715
Because Princess has a position of great esteem.

438
00:26:04,715 --> 00:26:07,358
I'm scared that one day, I might unknowingly offend you,

439
00:26:07,358 --> 00:26:09,123
that's why I'm asking for a safety amulet first.

440
00:26:09,123 --> 00:26:10,316
What are you talking about?

441
00:26:10,316 --> 00:26:13,070
To think that I treated you as a bosom friend too.

442
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:15,840
Don't worry, when we, the children of the grassland, recognize someone as a friend,

443
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,223
that friendship status doesn't change easily.

444
00:26:18,395 --> 00:26:19,688
Thank you, Princess.

445
00:26:19,688 --> 00:26:21,520
Then I'll be off first.

446
00:26:22,033 --> 00:26:23,201
Farewell.

447
00:26:23,201 --> 00:26:24,887
Farewell.

448
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:31,203
Come have a seat in my tent.

449
00:26:40,023 --> 00:26:41,570
Go stand guard outside the door.

450
00:26:41,570 --> 00:26:42,399
Without my permission,

451
00:26:42,399 --> 00:26:44,085
no one is to enter.

452
00:26:44,085 --> 00:26:45,878
Yes

453
00:26:49,133 --> 00:26:53,146
When we return to the capital in September, I'll ask Imperial Father to bestow marriage upon us.

454
00:26:56,122 --> 00:26:57,929
Has your arm recovered?

455
00:26:58,033 --> 00:27:00,455
The burn wasn't too serious in the first place.

456
00:27:00,455 --> 00:27:02,605
It's just that the Imperial Physician saw that a prince was injured,

457
00:27:02,605 --> 00:27:05,696
and was extra anxious, so he exaggerated a little.

458
00:27:05,696 --> 00:27:07,964
The arrow wound is treated with the medicine Ninth Brother bought,

459
00:27:07,964 --> 00:27:09,404
it's healing quickly too.

460
00:27:09,404 --> 00:27:12,662
If I rest for another half a month or so, I should be able to ride with no problem.

461
00:27:12,662 --> 00:27:16,923
Before we return to the capital, I'll definitely be able to teach you how to ride a horse.

462
00:27:17,538 --> 00:27:19,802
I'll bring some books for you to read.

463
00:27:22,175 --> 00:27:25,029
Before entering the palace, you couldn't even read a book of Song poems properly.

464
00:27:25,029 --> 00:27:27,267
Btu now, you've even read the Compendium of Medical Herbs.

465
00:27:27,267 --> 00:27:28,651
There really aren't many ladies

466
00:27:28,651 --> 00:27:31,252
who love reading as much as you.

467
00:27:31,252 --> 00:27:33,810
Luckily, I have a lot of rare collector's books in my residence.

468
00:27:33,810 --> 00:27:36,314
There'll be more than enough for you to read in future.

469
00:27:36,314 --> 00:27:38,589
That's because I have nothing to do.

470
00:27:38,589 --> 00:27:41,176
In the palace, there's nothing to do anyway,

471
00:27:41,176 --> 00:27:44,416
so I can only read some book.

472
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:51,033
In the future, I won't let you not have anything to do.

473
00:27:59,389 --> 00:28:02,018
I previously heard Fourteenth Brother mention

474
00:28:02,018 --> 00:28:05,012
that you once recited a poem for Tenth Brother.

475
00:28:05,012 --> 00:28:09,609
I wonder if today, I'll have the good fortune to hear you recite a poem for me.

476
00:28:16,193 --> 00:28:19,419
♫ Waiting for summer, waiting for autumn, ♫

477
00:28:19,419 --> 00:28:22,577
♫  waiting for the next season. ♫

478
00:28:22,577 --> 00:28:25,249
♫ I have to wait for the moon to become full ♫

479
00:28:25,249 --> 00:28:28,839
♫ before you'll be back at my side again. ♫

480
00:28:28,839 --> 00:28:32,097
♫ To meet or not to meet again? ♫

481
00:28:32,097 --> 00:28:35,132
♫ What to do? I still think of you. ♫

482
00:28:35,132 --> 00:28:38,243
♫ I suddenly want to see your face. ♫

483
00:28:38,243 --> 00:28:41,176
♫ That familiar feeling. ♫

484
00:28:41,176 --> 00:28:44,227
♫ It's all right even if we don't hold hands. ♫

485
00:28:44,227 --> 00:28:47,392
♫ We stroll through wind and frost. ♫

486
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:49,814
♫ Even if we can't see each other, ♫

00:29:00,588 --> 00:29:03,560

♫ I, too, will wait for you till I'm old. ♫

492
00:29:11,237 --> 00:29:13,441
Eighth Prince,

493
00:29:13,798 --> 00:29:17,692
I understand your thoughts and feelings,

494
00:29:17,692 --> 00:29:19,182
and will remember them in my heart.

495
00:29:19,182 --> 00:29:25,004
♫ is my warm support ♫

496
00:29:47,106 --> 00:29:49,366
Ninth Brother, who would have thought that the flowers here would bloom so beautifully?

497
00:29:49,366 --> 00:29:51,777
- That's right.
- Ninth Brother, Tenth Brother!

498
00:29:52,492 --> 00:29:54,506
You're back? Did you meet Eighth Brother?

499
00:29:54,506 --> 00:29:55,506
I met him.

500
00:29:55,506 --> 00:29:57,437
I've told him everything that needs to be said. Don't worry.

501
00:29:57,437 --> 00:29:58,120
Great.

502
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:00,185
Fourteenth Brother, did you see Ruoxi?

503
00:30:00,185 --> 00:30:02,174
I met her. Of course, I met her.

504
00:30:02,174 --> 00:30:03,189
Is she doing well?

505
00:30:03,189 --> 00:30:06,325
Great. She couldn't be better.

506
00:30:06,325 --> 00:30:07,097
That's good then.

507
00:30:07,097 --> 00:30:08,390
I was scared that in a moment of temper,

508
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:09,683
she'd get into trouble again.

509
00:30:09,683 --> 00:30:11,677
Honestly!

510
00:30:12,730 --> 00:30:14,142
Whether or not she gets into trouble,

511
00:30:14,142 --> 00:30:16,339
how is that linked to you?!

512
00:30:17,165 --> 00:30:19,852
When we men talk, why do women like you interrupt?

513
00:30:19,852 --> 00:30:21,702
You're the only one allowed to talk? And I'm not even allowed to listen?!

514
00:30:21,702 --> 00:30:23,096
This... this...

515
00:30:23,096 --> 00:30:24,367
- I...
- If you have nothing to feel guilty about,

516
00:30:24,367 --> 00:30:26,007
you, you, you, why would you be scared ?!

517
00:30:26,007 --> 00:30:27,196
Why would you be scared?!

518
00:30:27,196 --> 00:30:28,443
I... not scared!

519
00:30:28,443 --> 00:30:30,008
Who said I'm scared? Who said I'm scared?

520
00:30:30,008 --> 00:30:31,030
- You're not scared?
- Who says I'm scared?

521
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:32,355
- You're not scared? You're not scared?
- Ninth Brother!

522
00:30:32,355 --> 00:30:33,616
Ninth Brother!

523
00:30:33,616 --> 00:30:36,213
Look at you! You've made Ninth Brother so angry he's left!

524
00:30:36,213 --> 00:30:37,515
If you're still thinking about her,

525
00:30:37,515 --> 00:30:39,321
you can very well submit a petition to His Majesty,

526
00:30:39,321 --> 00:30:40,457
and go to the grass plains right now.

527
00:30:40,457 --> 00:30:41,743
There, won't it still be in time?

528
00:30:41,743 --> 00:30:43,197
I...

529
00:30:43,197 --> 00:30:45,144
Who says I miss her?

530
00:30:45,144 --> 00:30:46,719
You, you're making a fuss over nothing!

531
00:30:46,719 --> 00:30:47,576
You don't miss her?

532
00:30:47,576 --> 00:30:50,620
The whole world knows about it!

533
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:52,106
Fourteenth Brother,

534
00:30:53,885 --> 00:30:57,547
I haven't seen you visiting Mother lately; you left the capital?

535
00:30:57,547 --> 00:31:00,380
Yes. I thought that it was boring in the capital,

536
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:02,444
so I went out to relieve boredom.

537
00:31:02,444 --> 00:31:04,975
Imperial Father is coming back soon.

538
00:31:04,975 --> 00:31:07,079
Rein yourself in.

539
00:31:08,994 --> 00:31:11,130
Crown Prince and Eighth Brother have been accompanying Imperial Father for several months.

540
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:12,609
I wonder how they are.

541
00:31:12,909 --> 00:31:14,451
Yes.

542
00:31:14,451 --> 00:31:16,448
Imperial Father doesn't allow us to send private messages either.

543
00:31:16,448 --> 00:31:19,188
Who knows how Crown Prince and Eighth Brother are currently?

544
00:31:19,188 --> 00:31:21,685
If you're free, go visit Mother more often.

545
00:31:30,728 --> 00:31:31,678
Fourteenth Brother

546
00:31:31,678 --> 00:31:33,522
should have met with Eighth Brother already.

547
00:31:33,522 --> 00:31:36,547
It must've been regarding this matter of the reallocation of officials.

548
00:31:37,408 --> 00:31:39,666
The name list this time is disadvantageous to Eighth Brother.

549
00:31:39,666 --> 00:31:40,931
If he knows,

550
00:31:40,931 --> 00:31:42,920
he will definitely interfere.

551
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:44,792
Because of the previous incident with the Crown Prince, Eighth Brother

552
00:31:44,792 --> 00:31:47,393
was reprimanded by Imperial Father, who said that he was colluding with officials and forming factions of his own.

553
00:31:47,393 --> 00:31:49,258
This time, even if he knows,

554
00:31:49,258 --> 00:31:51,926
he probably won't take it too far either.

555
00:31:52,367 --> 00:31:55,534
This time, on the name list, most of it is Crown Prince's people.

556
00:31:55,534 --> 00:31:57,895
We merely recommended a Nian Gengyao.

557
00:31:57,895 --> 00:31:59,442
Given Eighth Brother's disposition,

558
00:31:59,442 --> 00:32:02,175
he should probably leave us some benefits.

559
00:32:02,175 --> 00:32:03,833
He will gather all his power

560
00:32:03,833 --> 00:32:06,569
to suppress the Crown Prince.

561
00:32:12,285 --> 00:32:14,189
Greetings to Imperial Father.

562
00:32:14,189 --> 00:32:15,018
Rise.

563
00:32:15,018 --> 00:32:17,136
Thank you, Imperial Father.

564
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:20,183
Has your arm healed?

565
00:32:20,183 --> 00:32:21,494
Thank you Imperial Father for remaining concerned about it.

566
00:32:21,494 --> 00:32:22,516
In a few more days,

567
00:32:22,516 --> 00:32:24,380
it'll be no problem mounting a horse either.

568
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:25,945
You should rest for a few more days.

569
00:32:25,945 --> 00:32:27,285
Don't push yourself beyond what you're capable of.

570
00:32:27,285 --> 00:32:29,301
I will remember.

571
00:32:31,184 --> 00:32:33,956
That day, when the imperial physician gave me the prescription,

572
00:32:33,956 --> 00:32:35,403
he sighed

573
00:32:35,403 --> 00:32:37,378
that if there were water from the Medicinal Spring,

574
00:32:37,378 --> 00:32:40,534
it would definitely be a great remedy for burns.

575
00:32:42,331 --> 00:32:44,650
Medicinal Spring?

576
00:32:45,364 --> 00:32:47,740
Are you talking about the one in Xining?

577
00:32:48,833 --> 00:32:50,512
I've heard that this spring

578
00:32:50,512 --> 00:32:52,416
had been buried for many years.

579
00:32:52,416 --> 00:32:57,183
Later, it was discovered by Military Official Yingtai, and was uncovered.

580
00:32:57,183 --> 00:32:58,500
I heard that Yingtai

581
00:32:58,500 --> 00:32:59,977
incidentally heard rumours,

582
00:32:59,977 --> 00:33:01,788
and was determined to dig up this spring,

583
00:33:01,788 --> 00:33:03,445
and improve people's welfare.

584
00:33:03,445 --> 00:33:05,117
He really means well.

585
00:33:05,117 --> 00:33:06,369
No wonder that in court,

586
00:33:06,369 --> 00:33:08,420
he has a good reputation for being noble and upright.

587
00:33:22,170 --> 00:33:24,149
I have also heard

588
00:33:25,242 --> 00:33:27,928
that Yingtai and you have always had a good relationship.

589
00:33:28,498 --> 00:33:30,815
When he's out, he often sings praises

590
00:33:30,815 --> 00:33:33,260
that Eighth Bei'le is virtuous and intelligent.

591
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:35,814
I am just a Bei'le.

592
00:33:35,814 --> 00:33:38,893
I dare not accept the title of being virtuous and kind.

593
00:33:38,893 --> 00:33:40,840
Yingtai's good reputation of being noble and upright

594
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:43,507
didn't come from me either.

595
00:33:43,507 --> 00:33:47,808
It's just I happened to hear Ga Li praise him in this manner.

596
00:33:50,248 --> 00:33:53,566
I just heard it by chance.

597
00:34:09,583 --> 00:34:12,734
But, speaking of being clean officials,

598
00:34:12,734 --> 00:34:16,112
Ga Li is also one such official.

599
00:34:18,759 --> 00:34:21,219
Ga Li is a clean official.

600
00:34:21,219 --> 00:34:23,344
He's been the Governor of Fujian for less than two years,

601
00:34:23,344 --> 00:34:26,880
and he already has a good reputation amongst the commoners.

602
00:34:29,647 --> 00:34:32,389
It's true that Ga Li is a talent.

603
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:36,105
Imperial Father,

604
00:34:36,305 --> 00:34:38,180
before I came out on this expedition,

605
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:40,419
I'd also kept an eye on Nian Gengyao.

606
00:34:40,419 --> 00:34:42,014
Although he comes from lowly beginnings,

607
00:34:42,014 --> 00:34:43,700
he's intelligent

608
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:45,496
and is a very generous and open-minded person.

609
00:34:45,496 --> 00:34:47,060
If there's a chance,

610
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:48,700
I would like to recommend him

611
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:51,338
to work for Imperial Father.

612
00:34:53,074 --> 00:34:56,132
Also, Jiang Qi isn't bad either.

613
00:34:56,728 --> 00:35:01,159
Jiang Qi? Jiang Qi is someone we can definitely use.

614
00:35:01,859 --> 00:35:04,500
If there's a chance, let's find more

615
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,440
talents like them,

616
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,740
to work for court.

617
00:35:09,585 --> 00:35:11,820
Ga Li is the Crown Prince's man.

618
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:14,420
Nian Gengyao is that of Fourth Prince's.

619
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:16,160
He's so thorough, covering all aspects,

620
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:19,480
it'd be hard for the Emperor to be suspicious anymore.

621
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,720
Fourth Brother.

622
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:27,054
Greetings to Wangye.

623
00:35:27,054 --> 00:35:29,111
Excused.

624
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:32,280
Imperial Father has already decreed,

625
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:35,880
he wants to change the list of officials being re-allocated.

626
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:37,420
How did this happen?

627
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:39,173
The name list of the officials had already been decided,

628
00:35:39,173 --> 00:35:40,900
and His Majesty is thousands of miles away.

629
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:43,520
Why would he make a change now?

630
00:35:44,406 --> 00:35:47,020
I'm sure this is a result of Eighth Brother's efforts.

631
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:49,120
Of course, we must also owe it to Fourteenth Brother's audacity,

632
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,404
sneaking out of the Great Wall,

633
00:35:50,404 --> 00:35:51,920
and secretly sending news to Eighth Brother.

634
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:52,900
Fourth Brother,

635
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:55,680
will this re-allocation have a big impact on us?

636
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,416
No matter how they swap up the name list,

637
00:35:57,416 --> 00:35:58,380
Gengyao's name

638
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:00,420
has always been on it.

639
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:02,580
This time, he will become the Inspector General of Sichuan.

640
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:05,851
Looks like Imperial Father really does like you a lot.

641
00:36:08,369 --> 00:36:10,155
General Nian,

642
00:36:10,155 --> 00:36:12,860
your position in court can be considered as stable now.

643
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:14,720
To rise from the position of a lowly Hanlin official

644
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,380
to today's office,

645
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:18,620
it's all thanks to the helping hand you've given me.

646
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:19,660
Your concubine greets Wang'ye

647
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:21,280
and Thirteenth Prince.

648
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,680
Greetings to Meimei (younger sister).

649
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:23,940
Gege (older brother), hurry and rise.

650
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:24,960
Thank you, Meimei.

651
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,200
Since you were coming,

652
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,240
why didn't you send someone to inform me first?

653
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:30,775
That way I would have been able to prepare the food you like.

654
00:36:30,775 --> 00:36:31,780
I'll go tell the kitchen...

655
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:34,060
No need. Today I'm here

656
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:35,420
to discuss business with Wang'ye.

657
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:37,180
I'll be returning to work immediately.

658
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:39,320
You have to leave again so quickly?

659
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:41,720
General Nian,

660
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:44,220
there's no need to rush to finish this work.

661
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:45,200
It's a rare occasion that you visit;

662
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,280
don't be in a rush to leave.

663
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,120
It just so happens that I have some matters and have to go to the study;

664
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:51,600
you siblings should have a good get together.

665
00:36:51,772 --> 00:36:52,500
Thank you, Wang'ye.

666
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:54,460
Thank you, Wang'ye.

667
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:56,240
Thirteenth Brother.

668
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:02,260
Gege, this way.

669
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:03,960
Please.

670
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:08,840
When you return this time,

671
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,620
you must perform to the best of your ability.

672
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:12,780
Show some accomplishments soon;

673
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:15,620
don't disappoint Imperial Father in his high hopes for you.

674
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:18,600
I definitely will not disappoint.

675
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,260
Wang'ye,

676
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:23,228
I have always been straightforward,

677
00:37:23,228 --> 00:37:24,860
and cannot hold in my words.

678
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:26,800
Please forgive my presumptuousness.

679
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:29,560
General Nian, there's no need to differentiate between you and me. (when one differentiates me from you, it distances both parties).

680
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:30,860
If you have something to say, say it.

681
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:31,920
Thank you, Wang'ye.

682
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:34,220
My sister has been blessed with your deep affection,

683
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:36,120
and was brought in as Ce'fujin.

684
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:38,040
I am grateful beyond words.

685
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,620
But just now when I saw my sister's

686
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:41,360
countenance of utter gloom and depression,

687
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:44,637
as her brother, I couldn't help but feel my heart ache.

688
00:37:44,637 --> 00:37:46,100
Since young, my sister

689
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:47,680
has been doted on by me.

690
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:49,160
Ever since she's entered Wang'ye's residence,

691
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:50,980
she's loved Wang'ye wholeheartedly.

692
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:53,880
- Just now, she even...
- Nian Gengyao!

693
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:56,540
I understand that you dote on your sister,

694
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:58,740
but regarding the matters of my residence,

695
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:01,320
I'll take care of them myself.

696
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:03,820
Please forgive me. I dare not.

697
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:05,140
I know the glory I enjoy today (is because of you).

698
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:07,207
In the future, I'll definitely secure a vital post in the army,

699
00:38:07,207 --> 00:38:09,600
and repay you.

700
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:10,820
Are you really willing to

701
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:12,540
live and die for me?

702
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:15,160
I have no regrets!

703
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:19,080
Good, I promise you.

704
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:20,620
As long as I'm around,

705
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:22,940
there will be a place for General Nian in court.

706
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:25,720
Nian Gengyao thanks Wang'ye.

707
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:32,880
I'll take my leave.

708
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,080
Reporting to master,

709
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:45,040
the top grade bird's nest you asked for has arrived.

710
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,520
Order the servants to make preparations.

711
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:49,200
Tonight, I'll go to Concubine Nian's chambers to dine and sleep.

712
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,520
Yes, master.

713
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:53,840
Then which Fujin's chambers should this top-grade bird's nest be sent to?

714
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:55,440
Is it...

715
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:56,880
to be sent to Ce'fujin's chambers?

716
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,200
Send it to beyond the Great Wall.

717
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:02,360
Say,

718
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:04,140
was there really a Kuafu who chased the sun?

719
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:07,080
That's a myth, a fable.

720
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:08,080
Then do you think

721
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,400
there really was such a person?

722
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,240
Tell me.

723
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:12,400
I think... there wasn't.

724
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,640
I think there was!

725
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:14,960
Then there was.

726
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,480
Then I think there wasn't!

727
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,680
But while it seems there wasn't,

728
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:20,920
in reality, there was.

729
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:22,840
That's because a lot of people are like Kuafu,

730
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,440
it's just that they don't know it

731
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:26,080
and they continuously keep chasing after the sun.

732
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,320
Look! The Cowherd Star (Altair) and the Weaver Girl Star (Vega)!

733
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,240
It's not them.

734
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,880
They're over there.

735
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,800
I say no. It's them!

736
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,160
No matter how glib your tongue is,

737
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:42,560
you won't be able to argue against the truth.

738
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:44,400
If I say they are, then they are.

739
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,960
You aren't allowed to talk nonsense.

740
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,560
If you keep going, I'll get angry.

741
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:48,960
I insist that...

742
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:52,680
All right, all right. You know your astronomy.

743
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,600
We

744
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:00,800
should go back.

745
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:03,040
All right.

746
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:06,560
Carry me.

747
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,200
Miss Ruoxi.

748
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:39,240
Come in.

749
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:42,520
Greetings to Miss Ruoxi.

750
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:44,160
Rise.

751
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:50,000
Miss, this is a gift that Fourth Prince specially ordered to be sent to you.

752
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:56,160
Golden-Thread Bird's Nest?

753
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:58,920
The plain's climate is hot and dry;

754
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:02,240
eating bird's nest that will increase one's yin (cool energy) is just right.

755
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:05,720
Bring it back to the capital.

756
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:09,640
Didn't Miss say

757
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:11,320
that it's just right?

758
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:13,560
Why are you sending it back?

759
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:15,760
Anyway, I can't accept it.

760
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:19,640
Just help me to send it back.

761
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:25,000
But, how can this lowly servant

762
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,960
explain this to Fourth Prince?

763
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:28,280
Ruoxi!

764
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:30,960
Are you free?

765
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,200
Princess Minmin,

766
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,560
this bird's nest is for you.

767
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:38,040
Bird's nest? What is it?

768
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:40,320
It's a treasured delicacy of the Central Plains,

769
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:42,300
it's swallow's spit.

770
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:43,760
Spit?!

771
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:46,320
I don't want something that disgusting!

772
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:47,720
Quickly, take it away!

773
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:50,320
It's best you take it back.

774
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:53,140
Let's not care about that expensive spit anymore.

775
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:54,680
Hurry and come with me!

776
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:01,280
Ruoxi, I want you to teach me to sing opera!

777
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:02,860
You promised me!

778
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:05,800
We're good friends so we have to keep our promises.

779
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:07,520
All right then.

780
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:09,360
Then I'll teach you to sing a nice tune.

781
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,640
What is it about?

782
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:15,840
This opera is about a girl who disguises herself as a boy to go to study.

783
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:18,580
Who'd know that she'd fall for her classmate?

784
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:19,840
In the three years that they studied together,

785
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:23,440
that boy actually didn't realize that his classmate was female.

786
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,040
Later, when she bade farewell before going home,

787
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:26,720
the girl had a promise from the boy

788
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:28,680
that he'd go to her home to ask for her hand in marriage.

789
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:31,080
Didn't that boy think it very strange?

790
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:33,040
That boy was a bookworm.

791
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:34,040
The girl said

792
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:35,720
that she had a younger sister at home,

793
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:37,260
who he'd be able to take as his wife.

794
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:39,680
That is a very beautiful marriage destined by fate.

795
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:42,520
It's great to be able to be with the one you love.

796
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:44,760
The road to happiness is paved with hardship.

797
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:46,760
When the boy went to propose marriage,

798
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:48,540
the girl, because of her parents' orders,

799
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:50,440
was engaged to another man instead.

800
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:52,160
How tragic!

801
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:56,280
Then, if you were the girl, what would you do?

802
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:58,920
I would give up everything

803
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:01,120
to elope with that man.

804
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:05,000
That's right. The world is so big, surely, that there'd be a place that can accommodate you.

805
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,360
But what if that man doesn't dare to?

806
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:10,140
I will spin a love web

807
00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:11,640
and trap him.

808
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:14,160
Love web?

809
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:15,960
Nothing.

810
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:17,700
Since you like this story so much,

811
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:19,200
then let us rehearse it in earnest.

812
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:20,600
All right.

813
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:23,280
Princess,

814
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:24,100
tonight,

815
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:25,880
I invited someone to watch our opera.

816
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:27,120
Who?

817
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:29,520
It's someone who's worth singing opera for.

818
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:31,600
It couldn't be Thirteenth Prince, couldn't it?

819
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:34,340
In Princess's heart, there's only Thirteenth Prince?

820
00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:36,160
Ay, don't laugh at me anymore!

821
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:38,360
This is very normal too.

822
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:44,400
Ruoxi, you give off a different, but good vibe when you dress in this guy's costume!

823
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:45,840
Likewise.

824
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:48,160
When you praise me, aren't you also praising yourself?

825
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:49,480
Enough!

826
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:54,880
Princess, Eighth Prince is here.

827
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:57,760
The person you invited to watch was him?

828
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:01,240
Eighth Prince, please sit.

829
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:24,740
The Goddess of Mercy sits in the hall.

830
00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:33,240
The golden boy and girl stand by her sides.

831
00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:41,760
Both of them obviously look like husband and wife.

832
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:50,560
Who shall light the incense burner?

833
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:59,000
Deity of Marriage may control the marriage of everyone,

834
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:06,600
but only those who are in love can be matched together.

835
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:13,800
Those clay figures and wooden carvings are just figurines.

836
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:23,640
They don't understand human courtship.

837
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:29,600
Brother Liang.

838
00:45:30,740 --> 00:45:38,360
Both of them have feelings for each other,

839
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:45,520
but just because they are figurines, it's hard for them to open their mouths.

840
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:52,840
Let Goddess of Mercy be the matchmaker.

841
00:45:52,840 --> 00:46:04,180
Come, let's have a wedding on their behalf.

842
00:46:04,180 --> 00:46:08,720
Brother, the more you talk, the more nonsensical it gets.

843
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:15,840
How can two men get married to each other?

844
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:24,480
Bravo. Bravo.

845
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:26,920
Well sung.

846
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:29,040
But which opera did this scene come from?

847
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:31,040
I've never heard of it before.

848
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:33,200
I composed it on my own.

849
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:34,780
I'm going to change my clothes now.

850
00:46:49,590 --> 00:46:54,340
♫  Stopping here, afraid to go any further ♫
