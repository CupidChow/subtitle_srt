Scarlet Heart
Episode 27

28
00:02:07,812 --> 00:02:08,864
Quickly, search!

29
00:02:11,093 --> 00:02:12,486
Lu Wu!

30
00:03:33,038 --> 00:03:36,162
Prince, there seems to be a person next to the river, like you described.

31
00:03:42,858 --> 00:03:44,298
Lu Wu!

32
00:03:45,371 --> 00:03:46,857
Lu Wu!

33
00:03:48,715 --> 00:03:50,433
Lu Wu!

34
00:03:56,796 --> 00:03:58,560
Lu Wu...

35
00:04:00,214 --> 00:04:03,851
Lu Wu, Lu Wu!  Lu Wu...

36
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:45,193
Did they find Lu Wu?

37
00:04:56,553 --> 00:04:58,889
13th Prince didn't come to Court today.

38
00:05:00,968 --> 00:05:03,730
While I was sitting on the throne,

39
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:06,270
I stared at those people.

40
00:05:06,777 --> 00:05:08,913
All of them acting suspiciously.

41
00:05:08,913 --> 00:05:10,885
I can't trust anyone.

42
00:05:12,525 --> 00:05:15,968
I was thinking, "What is behind their masks?"

43
00:05:16,808 --> 00:05:19,166
Looking like they're so loyal on the outside,

44
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:21,455
but just how much of that is genuine?

45
00:05:26,496 --> 00:05:29,486
I finally understand now

46
00:05:29,486 --> 00:05:31,994
why kings are so aloof.

47
00:05:39,213 --> 00:05:41,403
When 13th Prince was here,

48
00:05:42,002 --> 00:05:44,213
I never felt this alone.

49
00:05:44,213 --> 00:05:46,210
Everything will be alright once they find Lu Wu.

50
00:05:51,265 --> 00:05:54,105
Your Majesty, Minister Wang begs for your audience.

51
00:05:56,239 --> 00:05:57,371
Granted.

52
00:05:57,371 --> 00:05:58,236
Yes, Your Majesty.

53
00:05:58,236 --> 00:05:59,786
Maybe, it's news of Lu Wu.

54
00:06:08,662 --> 00:06:10,137
Greetings, Your Majesty.

55
00:06:10,137 --> 00:06:11,759
Did you find her?

56
00:06:12,281 --> 00:06:14,819
Fishermen at the river found a woman's body.

57
00:06:14,819 --> 00:06:16,405
I went to investigate.

58
00:06:16,405 --> 00:06:19,648
The body's appearance was marred but still recognizable

59
00:06:19,648 --> 00:06:23,403
and all the jewelry matches those in the picture.

60
00:06:23,403 --> 00:06:25,578
Who else knows of this?

61
00:06:25,578 --> 00:06:26,580
To answer Your Majesty,

62
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:28,479
I haven't let anyone else know of this.

63
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:30,894
Nobody can know about this!

64
00:06:30,894 --> 00:06:32,873
That includes the 13th Prince.

65
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,802
Continue to investigate. Dismissed.

66
00:06:35,802 --> 00:06:36,778
I understand.

67
00:06:54,835 --> 00:06:57,175
No, this isn't possible.

68
00:06:57,175 --> 00:06:59,231
Lu Wu couldn't be that heartless.

69
00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:02,203
How will 13th Prince deal with this?

70
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:06,161
And Cheng'huan...

71
00:07:06,546 --> 00:07:09,051
When I named her, all those years ago,

72
00:07:09,051 --> 00:07:12,217
"Cheng'huan" meaning raised by both parents.

73
00:07:13,303 --> 00:07:16,396
Now, who will raise her!

74
00:07:18,925 --> 00:07:21,283
Ruoxi!

75
00:07:43,581 --> 00:07:47,182
Come, cheers.

76
00:07:55,749 --> 00:07:57,792
10 days have passed.

77
00:07:57,792 --> 00:08:00,996
13th prince is still relentlessly searching.

78
00:08:03,593 --> 00:08:05,865
She's tall with a gourd-shaped face. Look carefully, take a look.

79
00:08:05,865 --> 00:08:10,724
- No.
- Have you seen her? Please think again.
- I really don't know.
- She's this tall.

80
00:08:10,724 --> 00:08:13,421
- Come and take a look.
- Let's go.
- Yes, yes.

81
00:09:08,134 --> 00:09:10,949
His Majesty and I are really worried.

82
00:09:10,949 --> 00:09:14,180
He still looks fine on the surface. The cold countenance has become a habit already.

83
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:16,480
It doesn't seem much different from his usual look.

84
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:20,280
I, on the other hand, cannot keep my feelings hidden even if I wanted to.

85
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:39,920
Thirteenth Brother has not come to court for many days.

86
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,240
He spends all day, in a drunken stupor, in his residence.

87
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:45,040
Why don't you go and try talking some sense into him?

88
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,480
All these,

89
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:44,660
were drawn during the days after we were married.

90
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:47,280
I could not give her anything else.

91
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:50,920
We only had Heaven and Earth as our matchmaker.

92
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,660
The willow trees as our witnesses.

93
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,780
Miss Lu Wu looks very happy.

94
00:11:57,780 --> 00:12:00,620
This was the greatest gift you could have given her.

95
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,760
Although, we only met a few times,

96
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,140
there was always a sense that

97
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:11,400
her brows were always furrowed with many worries.

98
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,680
But when you look at these pictures,

99
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:17,000
inside she may have been harboring much anger,

100
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,880
but she was filled with joy as well.

101
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:24,280
Why did she have to leave?

102
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:28,040
With only a few fleeting words,

103
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:31,800
she erased the past ten years of our life together.

104
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,620
Why?

105
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:40,280
Even if there was something wrong in staying with me,

106
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:42,960
what about Cheng'huan?!

107
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,000
Why?

108
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,240
Why?

109
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:25,900
I have something to tell you.

110
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,320
Maybe once you have heard it

111
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,160
you can understand a few things.

112
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:48,160
Before I tell you the story,

113
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,760
I want to say a few words regarding other matters.

114
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:55,640
You and Lu Wu had a deep marital relationship,

115
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:59,200
but your Fu'jins also suffered in those past years.

116
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:03,960
Your children brought themselves up.

117
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:06,460
They hoped to see you again after so many difficulties.

118
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:08,940
But yet you're treating them like this.

119
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,240
Miss Lu Wu's ancestral hometown

120
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:35,020
is Wu'cheng in the province of  Zheng'jiang.  Do you know that?

121
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:39,000
I've only heard her say that she is from Jiang'nan.

122
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,260
She led a wandering existence,

123
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:43,120
so she was not willing to speak more about it.

124
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,200
And I did not want to make her sad,

125
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,120
so I refrained from asking anything further.

126
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:54,740
Many years ago, she

127
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:57,080
once wrote a letter to me.

128
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:09,200
"I, Lu Wu,

129
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,620
born in Zhe'jiang Wu'cheng

130
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:14,060
and raised in a well-endowed family.

131
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:18,200
My family and living conditions were just like normal people.

132
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:22,280
I was raised as a noble lady.

133
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:30,380
My ancestors have always been rich, having had many tall buildings with the means to use gold and jade to decorate them.

134
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:35,320
A green willow tree surrounded the courtyard and red lotuses covered the pond.

135
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:40,700
However, life can change outside of our control.

136
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:43,140
One day, trouble came to us

137
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:46,480
and my family was destroyed.

138
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,640
In Zhe'jiang Wu'cheng,

139
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,960
during the early days when the former Emperor had just ascended to the throne,

140
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:03,200
there was a big judicial case that stirred up the whole country.

141
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:07,000
Becuase the Zhuang clan had been part of the Ming Dynasty their records were revised.

142
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,380
Yet they continued to use the Ming Dynasty's old terms and country name.

143
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:12,880
Their crime was deemed the most severe and they could not be pardoned.

144
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:17,360
Everyone who helped to revise the Zhuang clan's historical record of being Ming,

145
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:23,880
including doing the editing, correction, and writing the preface were arrested, including all of their relatives.

146
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,180
Whenever one person was arrested,

147
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:28,060
his whole family, old or young, male or female,

148
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:30,040
every one of them was detained in jail.

149
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:35,280
At that time, 72  people were killed.

150
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,240
Out of the 72, the death of a thousand cuts
(Slow death by mutilation usually performed on traitors)

151
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,880
was used on 18 of them.

152
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:44,080
More then 100 were banished to a distant army.

153
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:47,400
More then 2000 were imprisoned.

154
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:55,360
There were untold numbers whose families were destoyed and family members seperated..."

155
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:04,920
She stayed with you in that difficult place

156
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:07,560
by your side for ten years.

157
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:10,440
That was her love for you.

158
00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:13,560
Now she has left by herself

159
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:15,720
because of her filial piety.
(Respect for her family and not to cause him any humiliation)

160
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:19,440
If you really love her sincerely

161
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:23,040
then please do not compel her to come back again.

162
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:27,020
Let her remain in Jiang'nan

163
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:30,040
and live peacefully.

164
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,040
This letter...

165
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:57,980
I am destined to be seperated from this love,
(From a lyrical poem by Courtesan Yan'Rui )

166
00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:01,180
but where and how should I go?

167
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:05,200
If only to live freely with wildflowers in my hair,

168
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:09,720
then don't ask where I will return to.

169
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,220
Fu'jin.  You do not need to send me off

170
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:28,680
This is just to show my gratitude.

171
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:32,460
All these years you have suffered greatly.

172
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:35,380
Thank you for taking care of us all these years.

173
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:39,700
Compared to 13th Prince and Lady Lu Wu, I was living a good life.

174
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:41,980
I was just worried.

175
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,340
Is that Cheng'huan?

176
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:48,860
Yes.

177
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:51,460
She's only just back to us from the Emperor's.

178
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:54,240
She's here to become more familiar with her father and mother.

179
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,540
But Lu Wu is now gone.

180
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:59,660
And her father is always alone drinking wine in his room.

181
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:01,780
She's become like this...

182
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,140
Cheng Huan.

183
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:14,620
Can Lady bring you into the palace?

184
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:18,860
In the Palace, there is 4th Uncle and your brother. (cousin)

185
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:20,980
You smell of alcohol.

186
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:23,380
Cheng Huan.

187
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:27,980
When did Imperial Uncle and the brother start living in the Palace?

188
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:29,900
Don't lie to me!

189
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:32,140
I'll become a small dog if I lie.

190
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:37,800
Let's go.

191
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,360
If I don't see them,

192
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:42,760
I can tell Imperial Uncle to hit you.

193
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:45,960
Cheng Huan, where are you going?

194
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,140
Fu'Jin...

195
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:52,860
I have something I need to talk to her about

196
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:54,520
I understand.

197
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:58,560
Cheng Huan, let's go on ahead.

198
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:13,300
I don't know what we need to talk about.

199
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:16,420
What did you talk to Lu Wu about?

200
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:23,860
Every day, I talked to her about many things. So, I'm not sure which conversation you're refering to.

201
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,140
Lady Rouxi!

202
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:30,420
If you didn't have a child,

203
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:32,820
you would have lost your life much earlier!

204
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:42,560
Imperial Uncle!  Imperial Uncle!

205
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,340
Cheng Huan.

206
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:46,240
Uncle! Father is always in his room drinking wine.

207
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,360
He ignores me.

208
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,900
This Older Sister is also drunk

209
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:52,820
and she almost got into a fight!

210
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:55,840
Uncle understands.

211
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,740
Cheng Huan, good girl.

212
00:20:58,140 --> 00:20:59,780
Gao Wu Yong!

213
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:02,380
Your servant is here.

214
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:04,340
Take Cheng Huan over to the Empress' palace.

215
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:05,980
Yes.

216
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,940
Ge'ge.
(Princess)

217
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:16,780
So how did your trip go?

218
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:20,380
13th Prince should be able to let Lu Wu go now.

219
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:25,980
He'll be fine in a little while.

220
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:27,540
How did you convince him?

221
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,740
I made up a huge lie.

222
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:34,640
I hinted to 13th Prince,

223
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:39,580
that Lu Wu is a descendant of the family destroyed by the "History Record of Ming" case.

224
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:45,220
How did you get him to believe you?

225
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:50,400
Firstly, I have never lied to 13th Prince.

226
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:55,080
He would never think that I'd lie about such a big matter.

227
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,820
Secondly,

228
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:59,100
that year Lu Wu asked me to help her

229
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:01,540
and she wrote me a letter.

230
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:05,920
In it, she mentioned that she was originally from Zhe'jiang Wu'cheng and

231
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:09,420
her family was either rich or noble.

232
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:11,660
I had long forgotten about it.

233
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:13,300
So I was going to bring that letter,

234
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:15,860
because I originally wanted to leave 13th Prince with a memento.

235
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:19,340
On my way to Yi Qin'wang's estate, I read the letter more carefully.

236
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:21,060
I remembered that several days ago,

237
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:24,060
I happen to see the records of that case.

238
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:27,260
A thought suddenly came to me,

239
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:29,720
that since I was lying to him anyway,

240
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:32,860
it did not matter if the lie was a small matter or a big matter.

241
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:40,560
Could it be

242
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:49,620
when the 13th Prince was released

243
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:52,320
he was going to present a request asking me to confer (a title on) Lu Wu?

244
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,560
Based on tradition,

245
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:56,180
I had already checked her past.

246
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,340
Your prediction was correct.

247
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:09,060
For this problem,

248
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:13,140
I did not confer her with a title for a long time.

249
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,820
If this problem was known to

250
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:17,800
9th Brother and others, they would use this to blackmail

251
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:20,180
and make a big deal out of it.

252
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:23,140
Based on 13th Brother's personality,

253
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:26,760
he would not allow Lu Wu to suffer for any reason.

254
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,900
I am afraid that if that day comes,

255
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:30,900
this matter will be impossible to resolve.

256
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:36,920
13th Brother didn't love her wrongly.

257
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:39,360
However, the way of her handling this event is too unyielding.

258
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,860
She did not set up a way to back out.

259
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,500
8th Brother.

260
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,180
I already found out why 13th Brother

261
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:57,100
did not come to Imperial Court for the past several days.

262
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:58,500
Turns out it is because

263
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:01,340
the "mistress" of 13th Brother - Lu Wu, has disappeared.

264
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:02,700
What "mistress"?

265
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:05,020
13th Brother can give Lu Wu a status.

266
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:08,300
Do you know the whereabouts of Lu Wu?

267
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:09,740
Don't know.

268
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:12,780
13th Brother has seached any and all possible locations.

269
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:15,100
It most likely will turn out to be bad news.

270
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:17,860
Seems like 13th Brother must be really sad.

271
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:23,220
Sad?  Were we not sad after 4th Brother and he made us suffer?

272
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:26,500
I heard a rurmor that said Lu Wu

273
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,560
is a descendant of the huge "History Record of Ming" case

274
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:31,200
and she previously worked in a brothel.

275
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:35,340
If we had used her to create a big problem for 13th Brother back then,

276
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:36,820
today's Emperor

277
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:39,620
would have been 8th Brother.

278
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:41,180
Now that I think about it,

279
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:43,780
we were just missing that step.

280
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:47,140
Why pour salt on his wounds?

281
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:52,860
8th Brother.  You just want to be a good man.

282
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:57,100
A person with a noble character will take things in the right way.

283
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:58,380
The problems between men

284
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:01,480
should not involve women.

285
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:03,180
What 8th Brother said is right.

286
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:05,500
13th Brother was under house arrest for 10 years.

287
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:08,500
During those times, only Miss Lu Wu stayed with him.

288
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:09,660
One can imagine,

289
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:13,340
how important Lu Wu is to 13th Brother.

290
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:16,220
Now that they can finally end the suffering and live a happy life,

291
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:18,820
the person who would follow him in life or death

292
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:20,980
left him to go to a faraway place.

293
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:24,220
How do you think 13th Brother

294
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:25,880
will endure that?

295
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:28,340
If he was not born into the Imperial family,

296
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:30,740
everything would turn out wonderfully.

297
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:32,300
Too bad.

298
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,580
We, as soon as we were born,

299
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:36,820
were left stranded in a big cage.

300
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:00,660
What are you laughing about?

301
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:03,900
When the Emperor sees this he is going to be especially happy.

302
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:06,620
It's just a snack. What's so great about it?

303
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:08,640
But it is handmade by Sister.

304
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,060
This isn't the first time.

305
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:11,140
Correct!

306
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:13,580
Sister puts the Emperor's needs as her first priority.

307
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:16,980
This is what makes the Emperor the happiest.

308
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:18,780
The Emperor will be tired.

309
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:22,120
Remember to clean well.

310
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:23,740
I know.

311
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:29,340
Sister, the wind is strong outside!

312
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:39,420
Emperor.

313
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:42,380
Please turn over the nameplate to indicate which lady will be with you tonight.

314
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:06,060
Sister!

315
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:09,740
The weather is very cold, yet you did not wear a cloak.  Hurry up and put this on.

316
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:11,900
Let's go back.

317
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:14,060
I won't be going back.

318
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:24,140
These days, I still live in that garden.

319
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:26,240
Come to my place and relax a little.

320
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,080
Alright.

321
00:27:51,037 --> 00:27:54,920
Eunuch Gao sent a hot water pouch and said that it should be placed on Jie'jie's knee.

322
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,340
I don't want it.

323
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:58,442
These few days have been cold.

324
00:27:58,442 --> 00:28:01,540
If you do not protect yourself, it is you who will suffer.

325
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:05,620
Even if you are angry, please do not be angry with your own body.

326
00:28:11,663 --> 00:28:13,180
Whose

327
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:19,780
nameplate?

328
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:24,460
Nian'fei.
( Minister Nian'geng'yao's sister)

329
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:30,380
But his heart and mind are here.

330
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,400
Can't let the cold wind come in,

331
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:41,420
so I'm going to close the door.

332
00:29:43,614 --> 00:29:44,860
You've come.

333
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:46,500
I came to return some things.

334
00:29:51,935 --> 00:29:53,460
I'm very happy.

335
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:56,780
Of course, you're happy.

336
00:29:57,340 --> 00:30:00,460
I'm happy because you're jealous.

337
00:30:02,012 --> 00:30:03,340
Are you alright?

338
00:30:05,209 --> 00:30:06,620
I'm fine.

339
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,980
Don't make life difficult for yourself.

340
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:14,780
Whatever you want, I'll give it to you.

341
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:21,780
Turn around.

342
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:36,260
You are to never let anyone touch your braid.

343
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:39,820
Only I can.

344
00:30:43,792 --> 00:30:45,780
Only you ever dare to.

345
00:30:57,709 --> 00:30:59,340
I want the hand bag.

346
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:35,640
Emperor.

347
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:36,820
Excused.

348
00:31:38,303 --> 00:31:40,020
What are you embroidering?

349
00:31:40,811 --> 00:31:42,218
It's almost the new year.

350
00:31:42,218 --> 00:31:44,940
This is a celebration gift for De'fei Niang'niang.

351
00:31:45,248 --> 00:31:48,160
When my mother sees the intention you put into it,

352
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:50,680
I'm sure she will be very happy.

353
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:52,723
Not to mention that your skill with embroidery

354
00:31:52,723 --> 00:31:55,540
is praised by everyone in the palace.

355
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:57,540
Your Majesty, your praise is too kind.

356
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:01,189
Actually, there's one present

357
00:32:01,189 --> 00:32:03,940
that she will surely like.

358
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:05,787
What does Concubine De wish for?

359
00:32:05,787 --> 00:32:10,180
She wants you to become the Emperor's wife and give her a grandchild.

360
00:32:14,621 --> 00:32:19,060
What's wrong? Don't want to give her this present?

361
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,820
I've already finished embroidering this.

362
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:27,780
Fine then.

363
00:32:27,824 --> 00:32:29,512
I'll help you give it to her later.

364
00:32:29,512 --> 00:32:32,220
She will be very happy.

365
00:32:33,241 --> 00:32:36,180
Why don't I go together with you.

366
00:32:36,423 --> 00:32:37,853
No need.

367
00:32:38,459 --> 00:32:42,140
I invited 14th to go and wish happy new year to our mother together.

368
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,840
Don't be like this.

369
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:53,413
Two days later I will go with you to wish a new year to my mother.

370
00:32:53,413 --> 00:32:56,160
At that time, you can present the gift personally to her.

371
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,980
What do you think?

372
00:32:58,296 --> 00:32:59,860
Fine.

373
00:33:00,286 --> 00:33:02,960
Then you should stay here and wait  for my return.

374
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,705
If I don't see you when i return,

375
00:33:04,705 --> 00:33:06,523
I will be very angry.

376
00:33:19,948 --> 00:33:20,728
Alright, alright.

377
00:33:20,728 --> 00:33:22,680
I can do it myself.

378
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:26,520
- Here, this one is for you.
- The Emperor arrives.

379
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:28,800
Eat it.

380
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:43,620
Greetings to the Emperor.

381
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,700
Excused.

382
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,440
There must be proper etiquette between the Emperor and his ministers.

383
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,779
Little Brother greets the  Emperor.

384
00:33:53,243 --> 00:33:54,640
Stand up.

385
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,640
Thank You, Emperor.

386
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:00,161
Imperial Son greets Imperial Mother.

387
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:06,200
You all can leave.

388
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:08,240
Yes.

389
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:13,360
What were you two talking about

390
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:15,068
so animatedly?

391
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,700
You didn't see?

392
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:20,260
We were talking about every day life.

393
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,400
Imperial Mother.

394
00:34:23,879 --> 00:34:26,660
Regarding my conferring the title of Empress Dowager,

395
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:29,300
have you finished considering it?

396
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:31,680
I will not consider it.

397
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:35,280
I do not understand why you're refusing this title.

398
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:45,660
Do you really not know?

399
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:48,320
Yes.

400
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:51,340
You took over the Imperial Throne.

401
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:54,400
Who let you take the Imperial Throne?

402
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,040
It was Imperial Father.

403
00:34:57,560 --> 00:35:01,680
Did your Imperial Father want to give the throne to you

404
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:04,720
or give it to your younger brother!

405
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,820
It was me.

406
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:12,580
Fine. If it was you,

407
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:14,420
faking the decree and taking over the throne

408
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:17,340
was just a rumor, right?

409
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:21,880
When Imperial Father passed away, I was not there either.

410
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:25,200
How could I fake the decree and forcefully take over the throne?

411
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:30,540
You have great foresight.

412
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:32,700
This chess piece,

413
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:36,040
you already put it into play a long time ago.

414
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:39,920
Mother, those lies and rumors

415
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:42,520
were made up by people intentionally.

416
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:44,780
Mother, don't be angry.

417
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:47,320
Look.

418
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:51,640
Even at this time, your blood brother

419
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:54,360
is still on your side.

420
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:57,540
Where has your conscience gone?

421
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:03,280
Can it be I am not your son either?

422
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:07,980
Yes, you're my blood-tied son.

423
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:11,800
Your brother is also my blood-tied son.

424
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:16,380
Your Imperial Father

425
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:18,260
told me himself

426
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:21,480
he wanted to give the throne to your brother.

427
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:25,380
Can it be, that was a lie?

428
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:29,920
Whether truth or lie,

429
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:32,460
what's done is done.

430
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:34,640
As long as brother is a good Emperor

431
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:36,420
and brings prosperity to his people,

432
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:39,960
who the Emperor was to be doesn't matter.

433
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,760
Yes.

434
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:45,600
What does it matter?

435
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:48,320
Why does it matter?

436
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:55,860
What's done... is already done.

437
00:36:56,500 --> 00:37:02,120
Mother cannot face the ancestors,

438
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:05,340
let alone face the position of Empress Dowager!

439
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:30,160
You all may leave.

440
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,700
Yes.

441
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:40,100
Have some food.

442
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:53,160
It's been like this for years.

443
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:55,980
Why make things difficult for yourself?

444
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:02,780
My mother just has 14th Brother in her heart,

445
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,340
it doesn't matter what I do.

446
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:09,800
I could never compare to him anyway.

447
00:38:12,673 --> 00:38:15,673
You are already the Emperor.

448
00:38:22,346 --> 00:38:24,822
Do you think I will be a good Emperor?

449
00:38:25,597 --> 00:38:27,098
As long as you think so,

450
00:38:28,244 --> 00:38:30,070
you are.

451
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:35,968
Do you know how hard it is to be a good Emperor?

452
00:38:40,544 --> 00:38:44,884
Every day I have to face those corrupt officials

453
00:38:45,264 --> 00:38:48,390
and face all the bickering and plots within the palace.

454
00:38:50,884 --> 00:38:52,616
I'm so tired.

455
00:38:54,699 --> 00:38:57,539
Although I am the Emperor,

456
00:38:58,096 --> 00:39:00,480
there are so many things

457
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,901
I can't do even on a whim.

458
00:39:04,437 --> 00:39:06,316
In order to make contributions,

459
00:39:06,316 --> 00:39:08,360
sometimes, I am stricter with myself

460
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:10,496
than anyone else.

461
00:39:18,098 --> 00:39:19,840
But I am also just a human.

462
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:25,147
I also have my weak moments.

463
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:33,560
In this enormous Purple City,
(another word for the Imperial Palace)

464
00:39:36,279 --> 00:39:38,000
there are many things

465
00:39:39,955 --> 00:39:42,887
that I can never tell anyone else.

466
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:53,000
I wish you could understand.

467
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:46,139
You've awakened.

468
00:40:53,517 --> 00:40:56,518
13th Brother always said your alcohol capacity was good

469
00:40:56,643 --> 00:40:58,793
but I didn't believe it.

470
00:40:59,592 --> 00:41:01,800
You actually got me drunk.

471
00:41:02,936 --> 00:41:05,458
Your alcohol capacity is just low.

472
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:08,160
Where are my clothes?

473
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:09,800
They're over there.

474
00:41:15,521 --> 00:41:17,280
Are you looking for this?

475
00:41:19,747 --> 00:41:21,120
Did you look at it yet?

476
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:22,680
No.

477
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:26,320
Then open it and look.

478
00:41:37,403 --> 00:41:39,932
Before, I asked you why you didn't wear the hairpin

479
00:41:39,932 --> 00:41:42,200
and you said you accidentally broke it.

480
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:44,040
Yes..

481
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:48,298
At the time, you just smiled.

482
00:41:48,431 --> 00:41:49,800
How is it?

483
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:52,600
The same as the old one?

484
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:55,404
Pretty much.

485
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:00,373
Here.

486
00:42:04,352 --> 00:42:05,899
Like it?

487
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,040
I can't see it.

488
00:42:09,732 --> 00:42:11,843
I think it looks good.

489
00:42:16,139 --> 00:42:17,600
Wash your face.

490
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:32,200
Today is the first day of the new year.

491
00:42:33,006 --> 00:42:35,342
According to the rules, I should go back (to the Empress) today.

492
00:42:57,780 --> 00:42:59,073
Rouxi.

493
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:01,240
I've tried my best,

494
00:43:02,161 --> 00:43:05,365
unless you want me to send you away with a smile too?

495
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:21,434
Greetings to the Empress.

496
00:43:29,189 --> 00:43:30,320
Greetings to the Empress.

497
00:43:30,452 --> 00:43:31,840
Hurry and stand up.

498
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:34,437
It is inconvenient for your legs.

499
00:43:34,437 --> 00:43:36,178
Next time you don't have to greet me.

500
00:43:36,478 --> 00:43:37,680
This servant wouldn't dare.

501
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:39,081
I'll sit.

502
00:43:47,486 --> 00:43:48,760
You sit too.

503
00:43:56,774 --> 00:43:59,200
Compared to before, you've lost so much weight.

504
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:02,626
You must pay attention to your body on a regular basis.

505
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:05,480
Do you still remember that year

506
00:44:05,653 --> 00:44:08,280
when Imperial Father came to 4th Wang'ye's estate?

507
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,400
Ten years ago,

508
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:15,165
that was the second time I got to closely observe you.

509
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:21,573
You don't wonder why?

510
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:27,320
During the 51st year of Kang'xi's reign,

511
00:44:27,657 --> 00:44:30,880
the story of your punishment by kneeling was spread far and wide.

512
00:44:31,404 --> 00:44:34,360
Everyone was trying to guess what the reason was.

513
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:37,720
And then it started pouring rain,

514
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:40,080
the present Emperor hurriedly entered the palace.

515
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:44,097
When he came back, he was completely drenched.

516
00:44:44,547 --> 00:44:47,208
He stood by the window watching the rain,

517
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:50,880
but then he suddenly walked outside into the rain and stood for a whole night.

518
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:54,480
I begged him to come back inside,

519
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:56,240
but he just calmly told

520
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:58,360
someone to take me away.

521
00:45:00,476 --> 00:45:01,837
Was it the Emperor

522
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:04,530
who told you to say this?

523
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:09,340
He just said you weren't very happy,

524
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:13,400
so he told me to chat with you and tell you not to think too much.

525
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:16,120
This secret

526
00:45:16,414 --> 00:45:18,760
has been in my heart for many years,

527
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:21,120
today I've finally said it out loud.

528
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:27,960
Back then, I wanted to understand it.

529
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:29,080
I didn't know if the Emperor

530
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:30,320
did it for you

531
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:32,742
or for 13th Prince

532
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:37,200
or if he had some other reason.

533
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:40,720
Later, on New Years eve,

534
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:43,000
I saw the Emperor

535
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,120
not look at you on purpose

536
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:48,021
and I finally understood it a little.

537
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:54,800
At that time, 13th's Brother-in-law's imprisonment

538
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,720
and your punishment by kneeling

539
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:01,400
were times when the Emporer didn't have the power to protect the people he loved.

540
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:05,800
Maybe, only the cold rain

541
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:09,160
can numb the pain in his heart.

542
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:15,120
I said these things

543
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:17,680
so you could be a little happier

544
00:46:17,780 --> 00:46:21,737
and the Emperor can also worry less.

545
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:31,840
I know you don't really want to see me,

546
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:33,920
so I'll be going back now.

547
00:46:34,586 --> 00:46:36,160
Empress Niang Niang,

548
00:46:38,860 --> 00:46:41,280
I don't want to fight with you for anything.

549
00:46:41,684 --> 00:46:45,360
Nor am I purposely throwing a temper tantrum to see your reaction.

550
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:48,040
It's just that on some things

551
00:46:49,122 --> 00:46:53,640
I'm very conflicted.

552
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:56,840
I understand

553
00:46:59,180 --> 00:47:01,300
I've known you for so many years,

554
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:02,960
I know your personality.

555
00:47:05,660 --> 00:47:07,185
Or else

556
00:47:07,860 --> 00:47:10,200
I wouldn't have said so many things today.

557
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:29,380
