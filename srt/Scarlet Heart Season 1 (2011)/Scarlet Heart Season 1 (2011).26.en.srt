00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:20,730
♫  In the blink of an eye, a thought of stubborn persistence,  ♫

3
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:24,480
♫  we were destined to seek our doom like moths flying towards the flame.

4
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:31,000
♫  Knowing that it’d be a disaster, why am I still at a loss about what to do?  ♫

5
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:39,080
♫  The best is not to see, the best is not to miss you.  ♫

6
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:44,200
♫  Only like this can I not be in love with you.  ♫

7
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:48,280
♫  Just another brushing of the shoulder, and from then...♫

8
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:53,060
♫  I’ll keep falling deeper and deeper in love with you.  ♫

9
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:58,140
♫  It’s the mistake of time, ♫

10
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:01,620
♫  forcing us to pass each other by.  ♫

11
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:05,540
♫  How I miss you, how far you are.  ♫

12
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:07,870
♫  Even though I’d known it’d only result in pain,  ♫

13
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:12,060
♫  at this moment, I still don’t want to escape.  ♫

14
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:16,800
♫  Pity these words are too glaring, they hurt the eyes.  ♫

15
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:22,400
♫  Two worlds later. ♫,

16
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,400
♫  Don’t want to escape.  ♫

17
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:30,320
♫  It’s the mistake of time,  ♫

18
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,080
♫  we can only pass each other by.  ♫

19
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:35,230
♫  The magnitude of me missing you is as much as how far you are.  ♫

20
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:41,900
♫  Even though I know the ending is a mistake that I cannot oppose,  ♫

21
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:47,090
♫  Staying in this moment,  ♫

22
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:56,140
♫  We can only accept that the feelings run deep, but fate is shallow.  ♫

23
00:01:56,780 --> 00:02:02,180
Scarlet Heart
Episode 26

24
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:07,820
After 10 years,

25
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:09,780
we can finally be together.

26
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,760
Much gratitude to you, Royal Brother.

27
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:19,660
Come, eat more.

28
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:24,620
Eat some more.

29
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,660
Many thanks to Your Majesty.

30
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,740
Here, sit, sit.

31
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:40,100
Come. Let's eat.

32
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:41,940
Good.

33
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:47,260
After being separated for 10 years, this reunion isn't as happy as I imagined.

34
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:50,640
One is being purposely familiar,

35
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,160
the other follows all the rules of etiquette.

36
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,980
There is quite a bit of awkwardness.

37
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:02,420
I have finished.

38
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:03,700
There are many things I have to do.

39
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:06,020
I ask to be excused.

40
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:07,300
You may leave.

41
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08,580
Thank you, Your Majesty.

42
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:18,140
I'm full too.

43
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:20,820
Take away the food.

44
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:27,660
Do you think it's strange?

45
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:30,900
How did this happen?

46
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,980
Ever since his return, he has been like this.

47
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:41,200
Following all the rules of etiquette and being extremely respectful.

48
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:45,380
I wish for everyone else to respect me, even fear me,

49
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:47,700
but I don't want him to be like that.

50
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:51,880
I want to always be his Fourth Brother

51
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,340
and not just the Emperor to him.

52
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:57,500
Just work it out slowly.

53
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,340
Thirteenth Prince was imprisoned for 10 years

54
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:01,800
and has suffered so much.

55
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,580
Once he was released, he must have experienced so many changes.

56
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:06,860
He still hasn't warmed up to it yet.

57
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:10,140
I hope it's like that.

58
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:13,340
You two are the most important people to me.

59
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:42,300
How have you been sleeping recently?

60
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:46,420
Every day I sleep, at most, for 4 hours.

61
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:47,920
How about your appetite?

62
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:51,000
If it's something I like, I can eat a few mouthfuls.

63
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,960
If my body doesn't feel well,

64
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,340
I can't eat anything at all.

65
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:01,980
Your Majesty, from her pulse

66
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:03,800
it appears to be an old illness.

67
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:07,980
It will be hard to reverse the process.

68
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:09,180
What do you mean?

69
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:12,340
She has worried for many years, so the qi has knotted near her heart.

70
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:14,500
All five internal organs are now affected.

71
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:18,260
In recent years, her hands were often in cold water,

72
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:21,640
so the prison's cold has invaded her body.

73
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,740
Is there a cure?

74
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:26,720
This... I don't dare to say.

75
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,100
Say it!

76
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,420
Yes.

77
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:33,860
At the time, Royal Physician Li was the best in the Royal Physican clinic.

78
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:36,580
If he saw this lady back then,

79
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:38,680
he must have had a prescription

80
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,980
and a cure, but...

81
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:43,420
how the lady is currently doing,

82
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:45,120
no matter how good a physician is,

83
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,240
if the patient doesn't listen

84
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:50,140
the cure is useless.

85
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,620
Relax. This time I'm here.

86
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:57,240
I can ensure that she will follow the prescription.

87
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,520
If she follows everything,

88
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,140
can this illness be cured?

89
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:04,380
As I said before,

90
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:06,540
it will be hard to reverse the process.

91
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:09,060
Now, we can only take care

92
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:10,660
to not make it worse.

93
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:13,940
If everything goes according to my predictions,

94
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:18,140
I can ensure her 10 more years.

95
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:27,280
Give her your prescription.

96
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,660
Yes.

97
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:52,940
I'm sorry.

98
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:00,460
Don't put all the misfortunes

99
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:02,920
onto yourself.

100
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,660
Everything is fine now,

101
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:06,540
but after 10 years

102
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:10,060
I don't know if I'll want more time.

103
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:33,580
Here. Drink some tea.

104
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:52,140
These past few days, I've been busy with Court work and haven't paid a lot of attention to you.

105
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:54,540
I feel bad about it.

106
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,920
Why do you feel that way?

107
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,740
His Majesty values you.

108
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:02,220
You should put work first.

109
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:07,040
Now that Imperial Brother has been crowned,

110
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:11,660
his throne is unstable. Many Court officials wish to move and rebel.

111
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:13,360
No matter how small a matter is,

112
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,220
I must do it myself,

113
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:17,380
so that there are no mistakes.

114
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:20,660
If there is a problem in Court,

115
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:23,580
the consequences will be severe.

116
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:25,460
Although the saying goes that dying for your friends

117
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:26,980
is completely reasonable,

118
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:30,260
now that I have you,

119
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:33,780
I can't let you suffer with me again.

120
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:38,379
Prince, I don't deserve to be treated like this.

121
00:08:38,379 --> 00:08:39,820
Why don't you deserve it?

122
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:44,060
The most important thing in my whole life

123
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:45,820
is having you by my side.

124
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,440
I want to ask to His Majesty

125
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,340
to let you become my Ce'Fujin.

126
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:55,180
No.

127
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:56,620
What's wrong?

128
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:03,380
I am willing to be by 13th prince's side

129
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:05,220
and serve you.

130
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:09,460
I don't need any titles.

131
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:19,060
All these years

132
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:21,540
you have suffered enough.

133
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:26,140
These past ten years, if it had not been for you, I would not have made it.

134
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:32,580
Now, I don't want you to suffer from anything.

135
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:39,380
Prince.

136
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:48,900
We are each other's companion

137
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:51,260
and stay together.

138
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:54,820
It is a happy time.

139
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:03,980
It's another dirty account book.

140
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:05,340
What's wrong?

141
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,620
The account books.

142
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:15,660
The treasury is empty.

143
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:17,440
If I don't search carefully,

144
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,940
how will I know where the money went?

145
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:23,080
And the money that was taken away,

146
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,580
how will I get it back?

147
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:27,220
Of all the officials in the court,

148
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:29,580
only a few are clean.

149
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:32,820
Eventually, they'll ruin everything.

150
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:35,340
What about the 13th prince?

151
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:36,900
Why don't you let him come here?

152
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:40,480
Do you think I'll let him go?

153
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,420
He must feel like me right now,

154
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:44,620
full of headaches.

155
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:46,560
No wonder it's so hard.

156
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,280
They are all using single-entry bookkeeping.

157
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,820
What did you say?

158
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:55,640
I said, how is this all so messy?

159
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:58,080
Not everyone can understand these account books.

160
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:01,420
I spent a lot of time in the past learning how.

161
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:03,100
Can I have a look?

162
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,660
You understand these things?

163
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:07,740
If I do?

164
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:09,100
Even if you understand, I won't let you look.

165
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:10,580
Why?

166
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:19,380
Because you are my woman now.

167
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:21,060
I have you by my side

168
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:22,940
to have a good life,

169
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:25,220
not to suffer.

170
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:33,220
It's late. You need to rest.

171
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:35,340
You still have to attend morning court.

172
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,260
Why don't you go rest first?

173
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:40,940
I'm going to look a little longer.

174
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:45,860
After entering the Yang Xin Palace,

175
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:48,640
have you slept well once?

176
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,580
You can't look anymore tonight.

177
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:54,180
All right.

178
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:02,740
No peaking.

179
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:32,540
Don't be nervous.

180
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:35,260
I just want to be by your side.

181
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:11,420
Do you know? These past 10 years

182
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:14,380
I haven't had a good night's sleep.

183
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:19,180
I also don't know why.

184
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:22,880
Only when you are by my side

185
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,560
am I able to rest.

186
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:31,180
I am really, really tired.

187
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:36,940
Except for this palace,

188
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:40,700
I have nowhere else to go.

189
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:46,940
I only want to be with you.

190
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:06,980
Just let me hold your hand.

191
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:12,060
This way, I can sleep peacefully.

192
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:39,400
Don't release Yutan, please?

193
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:42,600
Let her stay and accompany me.

194
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,880
Your Majesty. Your Majesty.

195
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:44,600
Wake up. It's time for the morning court session.

196
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:53,860
Be careful of the cold.

197
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:07,220
After we were separated, I hoped we would reunite.

198
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:10,880
Several times while I dreamed, I was together with you.

199
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:14,260
Tonight, I looked at you frequently under the candlelight,

200
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:17,780
because I was still afraid our meeting was a dream.

201
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,460
Dreaming at midnight,

202
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:28,300
I also imagined that you were by my side,

203
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,780
but once I opened my eyes,

204
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:33,500
there was only the cold night.

205
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:47,260
Does the dream have this?

206
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,980
Do you really want to know?

207
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:55,380
Gao Wuyong is waiting outside.

208
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:02,140
Come.

209
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,300
Sleep some more.

210
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:11,940
Last night you slept late. Sleep.

211
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:41,300
Jie'jie. Please drink.

212
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:50,780
When did you start following His Majesty?

213
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:53,520
I knew that I couldn't keep it a secret from Jie'jie.

214
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,620
It was a few years ago.

215
00:17:56,620 --> 00:18:01,580
Eunuch Li would definitely be very sad.

216
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:05,200
Not only with you, but with me as well.

217
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,580
have disappointed him

218
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:13,680
In the washing sector, you secretly helped me.

219
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,920
Was it also His Majesty's orders?

220
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,080
At that time,

221
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:19,100
it was problematic for His Majesty to interfere

222
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:22,120
and in the palace, I was worth listening to,

223
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:26,560
so he ordered me to look for Zhang Qianying. The money was also his.

224
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:29,700
It was only me in name.

225
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:36,620
Besides, this matter concerned Jie'jie. I was very happy to help.

226
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:41,340
You were brought up by Eunuch Li.

227
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:45,120
Neither power nor money can move you.

228
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,920
So why?

229
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:50,140
Jie'jie doesn't know

230
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:53,820
that I have a brother. Our parents died early.

231
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:56,440
A long time ago, my brother and I relied on each other to survive.

232
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,700
My brother is rash.

233
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:01,400
Because the son of a county magistrate forcefully snatched a girl,

234
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:06,540
he accidentely killed that person and was punished with death.

235
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:09,140
Although I worked in the palace,

236
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:13,780
you know how my teacher is. He's very strict.

237
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:18,840
There was no place for me to speak, and it was so far away.

238
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:22,580
Even if I wanted to, I could not help.

239
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:26,920
My brother is the only one who can continue our bloodline.

240
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:29,140
I was very nervous then.

241
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:34,340
Luckily, Official Li heard about this later and intervened in the case.

242
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:36,400
He helped reduce my brother's sentence.

243
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:40,800
He said that although it is a crime, it doesn't deserve death.

244
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,640
My brother was beaten

245
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:48,760
and placed in jail for 8 years, but his life was preserved.

246
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:53,720
Official Li? Is it Li Wei?

247
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:56,040
Yes.

248
00:19:56,040 --> 00:20:00,940
In the central plains outside the place, he has Long'ke'duo. Inside the palace, he has Wang'xi.

249
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:05,460
4th Prince indeed has made all the possible arrangements.

250
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:10,780
Li De Quan, I have looked for you for days.

251
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:13,100
Today the emperor is not here.

252
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:15,380
Please tell me the truth.

253
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:19,900
On the day the previous Emperor passed away, what really happened?

254
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:21,580
To answer you, Niang'niang,
(Niang'niang - Queen Mother)

255
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:25,600
the passing of the previous Emperor was unexpected.

256
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:31,300
He left a verbal command regarding succession. This... this is well known to everyone.

257
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:36,260
I want you to tell me the truth today.

258
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:42,560
I know you have some difficulties.

259
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,880
I also know what you are scared of.

260
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:50,360
But you served the previous Emperor for so many years.

261
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:54,940
He viewed you as a trusted confidant.

262
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:57,860
If even you refuse to tell me the truth,

263
00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:01,160
who else can I trust?

264
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:01,980
I...

265
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:03,820
When the previous Emperor was still alive,

266
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:06,520
he personally told me himself

267
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:11,940
that the one he held in high regard was the Fourteenth Prince.

268
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:15,500
I want you to tell me the truth now.

269
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:23,520
I want you to tell me, on the day of the Emperor's demise,

270
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:28,400
did he really pass on the title of Emperor to the Fourth Prince?

271
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:39,460
There is no one to overhear, so tell me the truth.

272
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:44,300
I will do my best to safeguard your life.

273
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,120
Niang'niang, I... I...

274
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:48,874
Imperial Mother.

275
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:05,900
Your Majesty, how come today you are free to come to my palace?

276
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:11,860
I came to find Li'gong'gong.
(Gong'gong - Chief Eunuch)

277
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:16,360
Li'gong'gong came here to reminisce about former times with me. Why?

278
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:18,922
Does the Emperor also want to take part?

279
00:22:18,922 --> 00:22:21,801
Now that everything in the palace is being reorganized,

280
00:22:21,801 --> 00:22:24,927
these next few days Li'gong'gong will be kept very busy.

281
00:22:24,927 --> 00:22:28,420
He will not be able to reminisce old times with Imperial Mother.

282
00:22:32,993 --> 00:22:37,840
Li'gong'gong, there is already someone waiting at the entrance.

283
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:41,049
Don't you have to leave?

284
00:22:42,265 --> 00:22:43,460
Your Majesty...

285
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:44,980
Mother,

286
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:48,690
do you still want to meet with Fourteenth Brother?

287
00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:50,880
Governing the country is keeping me busy,

288
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:55,027
so I will let Fourteenth Brother return to keep you company.

289
00:22:55,679 --> 00:23:01,970
Li'de'quan, you'd better go.

290
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:06,532
Yes.

291
00:23:10,858 --> 00:23:14,077
Mother, you should rest well here in the palace for the next few days.

292
00:23:14,077 --> 00:23:17,416
I will take my leave.

293
00:23:54,945 --> 00:23:58,775
Li'gong'gong has worked hard for half his life,

294
00:23:58,775 --> 00:24:02,553
having accompanied the previous Emperor until his demise.

295
00:24:02,553 --> 00:24:08,093
For this... I want to thank you.

296
00:24:08,093 --> 00:24:12,837
I don't dare accept your grace.

297
00:24:13,898 --> 00:24:16,692
Offer him the wine.

298
00:24:38,945 --> 00:24:42,350
Li'gong'gong.

299
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:25,246
I thank your Majesty for your kind favor

300
00:25:25,246 --> 00:25:28,790
of letting me have the chance

301
00:25:28,790 --> 00:25:33,782
to continue serving the previous Emperor.

302
00:26:51,967 --> 00:26:54,889
Greetings to the Emperor.

303
00:26:59,108 --> 00:27:01,477
Why didn't you start eating first?

304
00:27:01,477 --> 00:27:03,613
Gao Wu Yong.

305
00:27:03,613 --> 00:27:04,858
Your servant is here.

306
00:27:04,858 --> 00:27:09,495
Gao'gong'gong has tried to persuade me a few times but I was the one who wanted to wait.

307
00:27:09,495 --> 00:27:10,298
You may leave.

308
00:27:10,298 --> 00:27:12,142
Yes.

309
00:27:20,201 --> 00:27:22,359
All this was made by you?

310
00:27:22,359 --> 00:27:25,781
It's a homecooked style, so the flavor cannot compete with that of the palace kitchen.

311
00:27:25,781 --> 00:27:28,896
Eat with my kind intentions in mind.

312
00:27:38,359 --> 00:27:41,770
Everyone is dismissed.

313
00:27:59,132 --> 00:28:02,683
I have already commanded Fourteenth Brother to come back for the funeral.

314
00:28:02,683 --> 00:28:06,923
In a couple of days, the edict should reach him.

315
00:28:09,032 --> 00:28:12,360
These last few days, I have always avoided thinking about Fourteenth Prince.

316
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:17,522
The capital has already changed its master but he still doesn't know that his father has passed away.

317
00:28:17,522 --> 00:28:23,427
Maybe he is still drinking wine and toasting to his father's health.

318
00:28:27,298 --> 00:28:30,356
I have something to ask you.

319
00:28:30,356 --> 00:28:31,749
Ask.

320
00:28:31,749 --> 00:28:33,721
The eagle that died,

321
00:28:33,721 --> 00:28:36,871
were you behind it?

322
00:28:38,893 --> 00:28:42,476
How did you know?

323
00:28:42,476 --> 00:28:44,952
On that day when I wanted to ask for mercy,

324
00:28:44,952 --> 00:28:47,320
Wang'xi prevented me from doing so.

325
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:49,735
At the time, I thought it was by coincidence.

326
00:28:49,735 --> 00:28:52,243
Now that I think about it,

327
00:28:52,243 --> 00:28:54,008
although Wang'xi is smart,

328
00:28:54,008 --> 00:28:57,655
the warning words he gave were full of crucial points.

329
00:28:57,655 --> 00:29:02,817
Only someone who knows me well would have been able to think that way.

330
00:29:02,817 --> 00:29:06,675
But he doesn't have that kind of intelligence.

331
00:29:10,115 --> 00:29:14,652
You are soft-hearted and impulsive.

332
00:29:14,652 --> 00:29:16,842
8th Brother is your brother-in-law. I was afraid you'd be impulsive

333
00:29:16,842 --> 00:29:19,921
and do stupid things,

334
00:29:19,921 --> 00:29:22,654
so I had Wang Xi look after you.

335
00:29:22,654 --> 00:29:25,547
Back then, I thought it was the 14th Prince

336
00:29:25,547 --> 00:29:28,320
I was afraid 8th Prince would think so too.

337
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:32,931
How did you manage to persuade Eighth Prince's servants?

338
00:29:32,931 --> 00:29:35,441
All humans have weaknesses.

339
00:29:35,441 --> 00:29:38,320
Normally, people think that young people are more susceptible to temptation,

340
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:42,121
but they don't know that older people have many more dark secrets in their hearts.

341
00:29:42,121 --> 00:29:46,229
Then why did they all kill themselves?

342
00:29:47,297 --> 00:29:49,659
Let's eat.

343
00:29:49,659 --> 00:29:53,349
I don't want you to know about these matters.

344
00:29:53,815 --> 00:29:57,523
But this has caused a lot of doubt and suspicions in me for many years.

345
00:29:57,523 --> 00:30:01,267
Tell me.

346
00:30:03,955 --> 00:30:08,003
The attendant was poisoned by the old eunuch.

347
00:30:08,003 --> 00:30:11,439
The old eunuch hung himself from the beam. So from an outsider's point of view,

348
00:30:11,439 --> 00:30:13,643
all of them committed suicide because they dreaded punishment.

349
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:18,940
So a human life is this cheap.

350
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:20,540
Where you not scared that the previous Emperor

351
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:22,580
would not just let matters rest like that,

352
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:24,580
but go on to investigate the case thoroughly?

353
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:28,580
Do you really think that Imperial Father did not really investigate the matter secretly?

354
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,020
I never thought

355
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:35,780
that he would handle matters with such hard-heartedness.

356
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:40,220
Actually, when I saw Imperial Father like that,

357
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:42,420
I was very surprised also.

358
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:46,460
But it has let me gain a clear view of many things.

359
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:48,420
Maybe the only thing you miscalculated

360
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:50,860
was that the previous Emperor would be so ruthless toward the Eighth Prince.

361
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:53,780
And therefore,  the Fourteenth Prince gained favor instead.

362
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:05,460
Your Majesty, Yutan has arrived,

363
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:09,100
what does Your Majesty want her to do?

364
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:16,040
Let her serve the tea.

365
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,420
Yes.

366
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:23,860
It's my fault.

367
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:27,020
Last night, you gave a grunting sound in your sleep.

368
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:29,660
I thought you were clear about it in your mind.

369
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:32,660
Forget about it.

370
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:36,060
I have overstepped my boundaries.

371
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:42,260
Between us,

372
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:45,140
there are no such words as "overstepping boundaries".

373
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:01,660
Gu'gu, it's late, please retire for the night.

374
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:11,180
Yu'tan. Yu'tan.

375
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:17,140
What is going on?

376
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:19,780
Chief Eunuch Gao has ordered us to watch Xi'que being punished.

377
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:22,040
For what matter?

378
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:26,060
She secretly reported the Emperor's living arrangments in Yangxindian to Queen Mother.

379
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:28,040
Besides the attendants of Yangxindian,
(Emperor's throne room and quarters)

380
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,780
the Emperor has also ordered those of Queen Mother

381
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:32,700
and the other palace maids and eunuchs

382
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:35,500
to watch. It is to punish her as an example to others.

383
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:43,260
Jie'jie, it's better if you not go over there.

384
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:46,660
The Emperor does not want you to watch such a scene.

385
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:49,460
Jie'jie!

386
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,580
This servant, in the future, won't dare anymore!

387
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:17,040
Why do you have to treat a small servant such as her like that?

388
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:18,900
Using such cruel methods.

389
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:28,980
Jie'jie, drink some hot tea to lift your spirits.

390
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:39,760
Yu'tan, what's wrong?

391
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:43,620
I am scared that sooner or later I will suffer the same fate as Xi'que.

392
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:45,580
Why do you think that?

393
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:48,160
In the palace, Jie'jie has advanced gradually.

394
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:51,040
I am scared that I haven't learned to be as cautious as you.

395
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:53,380
Now my heart is thumping with each step I make.

396
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:56,300
It is for my sake that you are still in the palace.

397
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:57,620
I promise you,

398
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:59,780
whatever happens,

399
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:01,540
just as long as I am here

400
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:03,940
I will definitely not allow you to come to any harm.

401
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:05,380
Jie'jie...

402
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:07,100
Don't worry.

403
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:10,380
Thank you, Jie'jie.

404
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,420
14th Brother.

405
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:47,820
The Emperor arrives.

406
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:12,720
Imperial Father, I have arrived late.

407
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,980
I could not be with you on your passing.

408
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:17,520
I am not filial.

409
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:58,400
Brazen fellow! The Emperor is before you and you're still not kneeling!

410
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,440
Scram!

411
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:40,640
Issue this decree.

412
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:44,740
I'm changing the General's nobility title.

413
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:46,840
His title is now Gu'shan'bei'zi.
(Prince of the Fourth Rank)

414
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:48,240
Yes.

415
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:55,560
What's the matter?

416
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:01,400
Ninth Brother and the rest are sparing no efforts by planting spies in the court

417
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:04,340
and using completely unscrupulous methods to find a cause for provocation.

418
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:06,080
Manufacturing some senseless disputes

419
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:08,280
with the motive that I will have no choice but to get angry.

420
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:11,120
I will not let them get that satisfaction!

421
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:13,380
Now that you are the biggest winner,

422
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:14,960
there are some things

423
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:17,360
that you really don't have to bother about.

424
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,840
Your Majesty.

425
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:21,093
Thirteenth Prince wants to see you about an urgent matter.

426
00:39:21,975 --> 00:39:24,019
I beg Your Majesty to issue a decree.

427
00:39:24,276 --> 00:39:26,573
Please rise. What has happened?

428
00:39:26,828 --> 00:39:29,568
Without your permission, nobody can enter or leave Jiu'cheng.

429
00:39:30,311 --> 00:39:32,169
Please grant me permission to leave the city

430
00:39:32,726 --> 00:39:33,841
to search for Lu'wu.

431
00:39:34,166 --> 00:39:35,420
What has happened to Lu'wu?

432
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:36,999
She left a letter

433
00:39:36,999 --> 00:39:39,739
saying that she does not like the life in a Prince's manor and longs for the mountains she loves.

434
00:39:39,739 --> 00:39:40,640
She has gone back to Jiang'shan.

435
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:44,057
She said that there is no need to go looking for her.

436
00:39:44,429 --> 00:39:45,404
How can this happen?

437
00:39:45,404 --> 00:39:46,751
How can Lu'wu bear to leave you?

438
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,098
Is it Cheng'huan too?

439
00:39:48,098 --> 00:39:48,920
She said that since there are you and Imperial Brother

440
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:53,320
and also me, Cheng'huan won't suffer.

441
00:39:53,903 --> 00:39:54,785
Imperial Brother.

442
00:39:57,293 --> 00:39:58,879
Eunuch Gao, send for Long'ke'duo.

443
00:39:58,879 --> 00:40:00,086
Yes.

444
00:40:00,086 --> 00:40:01,287
Thank you, Imperial Brother.

445
00:40:01,449 --> 00:40:02,517
Thirteenth Prince.

446
00:40:02,517 --> 00:40:03,864
Do you have a drawing of Lu'wu?

447
00:40:03,864 --> 00:40:05,350
Bring it so that the Drawing Master can make copies

448
00:40:05,350 --> 00:40:06,140
to be used in the search for her.

449
00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:08,044
Yes, I...

450
00:40:08,044 --> 00:40:10,101
I drew many pictures when I was imprisoned in Yangfengjiadao.

451
00:40:10,101 --> 00:40:11,494
I will go get them now.

452
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:20,907
Lu'wu!

453
00:40:29,306 --> 00:40:32,610
Lu Wu! Lu Wu!

454
00:40:36,165 --> 00:40:37,858
Lu Wu!

455
00:41:09,121 --> 00:41:10,920
I've already asked Imperial Brother

456
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:12,540
to grant you as my Ce Fujin. (Secondary wife)

457
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:13,733
No, don't!

458
00:41:14,987 --> 00:41:16,120
Why not?

459
00:41:19,902 --> 00:41:23,420
I just want to stay next to 13th Prince

460
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:25,018
and continue to serve you.

461
00:41:25,947 --> 00:41:29,383
I do not need any title.

462
00:41:37,828 --> 00:41:39,693
You have already sacrificed enough.

463
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:42,513
In these past 10 years, if it wasn't for you

464
00:41:42,513 --> 00:41:44,920
I wouldn't have been able to get through it.

465
00:41:48,168 --> 00:41:52,580
From now on, I don't want you to have to suffer at all.

466
00:41:56,141 --> 00:41:58,524
Mother, come and chase me!

467
00:41:58,774 --> 00:42:04,360
Hurry, hurry, hurry Mother!

468
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:06,930
I got you.

469
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:11,342
See. I got you.

470
00:42:15,902 --> 00:42:16,938
Come.

471
00:42:20,513 --> 00:42:21,640
Fu'jin.
(Main Wife)

472
00:42:24,143 --> 00:42:25,590
You've come just in time.

473
00:42:25,590 --> 00:42:28,640
We were about to go to the temple, to pray for 13th Prince.

474
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:30,280
If you have nothing else to do,  why don't you both

475
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:32,423
come with us too.

476
00:42:32,423 --> 00:42:33,538
Yes, yes.

477
00:42:33,538 --> 00:42:35,653
I want to eat candied fruit skewers.

478
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:38,068
All you know is eating.

479
00:42:38,068 --> 00:42:41,090
Chenhuan, all the other Ge'ge love to eat
Ge'ge - princess)

480
00:42:41,090 --> 00:42:43,320
special delicacies.

481
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:45,712
How come you are like a street child

482
00:42:45,712 --> 00:42:48,006
prefering to eat candied fruit skewers?

483
00:42:48,006 --> 00:42:49,840
Such common fare.

484
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:51,880
It's not that I'm scolding you.

485
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:53,880
I understand that it's your past life

486
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:55,374
and making you change all of a sudden

487
00:42:55,374 --> 00:42:56,713
is not possible.

488
00:42:56,713 --> 00:42:58,114
This is not your fault.

489
00:42:58,114 --> 00:43:00,560
In those types of places, after all,

490
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:02,340
having to roll around for so many years...

491
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,160
But Cheng'huan is still considered a high born young lady

492
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:08,974
So you shouldn't let her be like you.

493
00:43:08,974 --> 00:43:09,767
Jie'jie.
(Older Sister/ First wife)

494
00:43:09,767 --> 00:43:12,789
Isn't what I said correct?

495
00:43:12,789 --> 00:43:14,840
How can you have so much to say?

496
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:20,240
Let's go. we must not miss the auspicious hour

497
00:43:20,583 --> 00:43:23,400
Cheng'huan, be good, come with me.

498
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:24,717
Go on.

499
00:43:35,212 --> 00:43:37,255
Since I've already said everything up to this degree,

500
00:43:37,255 --> 00:43:38,880
then I will just say it directly.

501
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:42,600
Miss Lu'wu, you wouldn't want Cheng'huan
("Miss" in this case is an insult)

502
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:45,522
to have others know that her mother is of such low birth.

503
00:43:45,522 --> 00:43:47,658
So that others will look down on her, right?

504
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:51,512
Ce'fujin is correct.

505
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:55,281
If you really care about Cheng'huan

506
00:43:55,281 --> 00:43:56,980
I have a suggestion,

507
00:43:56,980 --> 00:43:58,760
but I'm afraid you won't agree to it.

508
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:01,829
Please go ahead and say it Ce'fujin.

509
00:44:01,829 --> 00:44:05,305
Let someone else raise Cheng'huan.

510
00:44:05,405 --> 00:44:07,620
I understand that this will be very difficult,

511
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:09,949
but you can't be so selfish.

512
00:44:10,042 --> 00:44:13,600
Not unless... you don't want Cheng'huan,

513
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:16,490
in the future, to be able to marry a prince

514
00:44:16,490 --> 00:44:19,376
and enjoy a life of high status and wealth.

515
00:44:19,632 --> 00:44:20,760
Putting it another way...

516
00:44:21,095 --> 00:44:22,840
Even the A'ge in the Palace
(A'ge - princes)

517
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:26,157
aren't raised by their birth mothers.

518
00:44:26,575 --> 00:44:29,454
The royal family has always been like this.

519
00:44:29,454 --> 00:44:31,440
What are you still considering?

520
00:44:35,739 --> 00:44:38,912
Because of you, 13th Prince has already been humiliated.

521
00:44:38,912 --> 00:44:41,900
Do you want Cheng'huan to suffer as well?

522
00:44:57,629 --> 00:44:59,120
Mother Mother, come on!

523
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:01,360
Be careful, slow down, don't fall.

524
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:05,631
Come on, hurry! Come with me.

525
00:45:08,605 --> 00:45:10,700
There are red flowers here.

526
00:45:10,700 --> 00:45:13,320
Mother, there are pink ones too, and purples ones.

527
00:45:13,620 --> 00:45:15,731
Cheng'huan, hold on.

528
00:45:17,542 --> 00:45:18,600
Come.

529
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:22,000
Kneel down.

530
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:27,030
Face in this direction.

531
00:45:27,030 --> 00:45:28,827
Bow to your grandparents.

532
00:45:28,827 --> 00:45:29,849
Alright.

533
00:45:30,592 --> 00:45:33,120
Father, Mother.

534
00:45:34,347 --> 00:45:36,776
Cheng'huan is bowing to you.

535
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:43,500
You daughter is not filial but I know

536
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:46,280
you will protect Chen'huan.

537
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:49,000
Who are Lao'ye and Lao'lao?
(Maternal grandfather and grandmother)

538
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:57,680
They are people who deserve respect.

539
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:05,000
In the future, you need to come often and bow to them. Understand?

540
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,720
Yes.

541
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:19,818
Come, let's bow.

542
00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:48,123
Together for 10 years, it was not easy.

543
00:46:50,540 --> 00:46:52,200
I'm just afraid if they can't find her--

544
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:53,340
No, they will!

545
00:46:57,480 --> 00:46:59,080
What is it that you know?

546
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:02,520
I hope that I've guessed wrong.
