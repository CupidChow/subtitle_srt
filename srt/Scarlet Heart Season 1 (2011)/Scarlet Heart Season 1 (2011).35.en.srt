♫  In the blink of an eye, a thought of stubborn persistence  ♫

3
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,180
♫  We were destined to seek our doom like moths flying towards the flame  ♫

4
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:30,720
♫  Knowing that it’d be a disaster, why am I still at a loss about what to do  ♫

5
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:38,840
♫  The best is not to see, the best is not to miss you  ♫

6
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:43,920
♫  Only like this can I not be in love with you  ♫

7
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:48,130
♫  Just another brushing of the shoulder, and from then...♫

8
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:53,410
♫  I’ll keep falling deeper and deeper in love with you  ♫

9
00:00:55,700 --> 00:01:02,000
♫  It’s the mistake of time, ♫
♫ forcing us to pass each other by  ♫

10
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:05,170
♫  How I miss you, how far you are  ♫

Scarlet Heart
Final Episode 35

23
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:05,470
14th Prince's concubine,

24
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:07,050
Maertai Ruoxi,

25
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:10,000
died yesterday.

26
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:21,460
Maertai Ruoxi...

27
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:22,880
Without my permission,

28
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,280
you cannot die.

29
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,560
YOU CANNOT DIE!

30
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,160
Letter? Where's that letter?

31
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:43,160
Imperial Brother.

32
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,240
Where's the letter?

33
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:09,080
[ Fourth Prince,]

34
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:13,160
[ Life is like a dream, continuously changing.]

35
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:17,180
[ Rights and wrongs. Gratitude and resentment.]

36
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:18,880
[ But the days pass soundlessly.]

37
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,880
[ Waters pass without leaving a trace.]

38
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:25,920
[ It's hard to forget one's foolish longings.]

39
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,780
[ When someone told me very calmly that he wanted the throne, ]

40
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:34,300
[ he already held the key to my heart.]

41
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:36,120
[ When he threw away the umbrella ]

42
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:40,160
[ and endured and suffered the rain with me,]

43
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,960
[ I had already opened the door to my heart for him.]

44
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,660
[ When he protected me ]

45
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:48,400
[ by using his own body to block the arrow,]

46
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,960
[ I knew I would never forget him in this life...]

47
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,220
[ Everything that happened after that ]

48
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:59,760
[ only drew me in deeper.]

49
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,680
[ Having said that, ]

50
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,000
[ Do you still need to ask about 8th Prince?]

51
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:08,320
[ If there is love, there is anger. If there is love, there is hate.]

52
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:13,300
[ If there is love, there is obsession. If there is love, there is longing.]

53
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:14,720
[ Since we parted, ]

54
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,920
[ there has been nothing but anger, hate, obsession, and longing, ]

55
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,840
[ transforming into inches of memories. ]

56
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:24,440
[ I don't know if you still resent me, ]

57
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:28,920
[ hate me, loathe me, or detest me.]

58
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:34,920
[ Underneath the wisteria bower, underneath the moon in the bitter wind, ]

59
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:37,060
[ between my brush, inkstone, and paper, ]

60
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:39,480
[ in Ruoxi's heart, there is no Emperor, ]

61
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:43,200
[ there is only the Fourth Prince who has stolen my soul. ]

62
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:48,780
[ We love, we yearn, we don't meet. ]

63
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:52,360
[ Why then, bear the heavy hearts that only make both lonely.]

64
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:55,760
[ My weak inner being shatters.]

65
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:00,640
[ This letter is as blurry as my words.]
(Means the words are blurred from her teary eyes.)

66
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:05,000
[ As I gaze into the courtyard, I long to see you.]

67
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,080
[ Day by day, I will wait for your arrival.]

68
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:12,240
[ ~ Ruoxi ]

69
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:44,640
Take me to see her.

70
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:52,880
Bring me to see her.

71
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,640
Second Miss!

72
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:18,320
Second Miss!

73
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:24,040
Second Miss!

74
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:30,120
Second Miss!

75
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,880
Only Wang'ye is attending the wake.

76
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,680
Wang'ye said CeFu'jin likes quiet, not--

77
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,960
Shut up! There is no Ce'Fu'jin here.

78
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:10,800
You may leave.

79
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:17,680
Ruoxi, he finally came.
(referring to Fourth Prince - Emperor Yongzheng)

80
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,440
Ruoxi.

81
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:56,960
After we parted ways last time,
(Rouxi's Memorial Tablet - belief deceased spirit resides there)

82
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:02,060
I thought we'd have another chance to meet again.

83
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:06,220
I thought I could always come here to see you.

84
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:07,640
Who would have thought...

85
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,480
Where's the coffin?

86
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:23,280
How is it, that there's no coffin?

87
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,280
Maybe Ruoxi didn't leave yet!

88
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,920
She is playing around with us!

89
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:33,880
Ruoxi!

90
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:38,000
Fourteenth! Fourteenth! Come out!

91
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,960
Fourteenth Brother,

92
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,720
why is there only a tablet but no coffin?

93
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:01,320
Ruoxi is here.

94
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,040
What does that mean?

95
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,760
I cremated Ruoxi.

96
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:23,720
Ruoxi...

97
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:27,080
- I'm going to kill you!!
-  Imperial Brother. Imperial Brother!

98
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:30,500
- Imperial Brother!
-  I'm going to kill you!
-  Imperial Brother, calm down a bit!

99
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,840
The fourteenth Brother would not treat Ruoxi like that.
(The body is a valued gift from the ancestors and buried whole)

100
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:36,280
Let's ask for an explanation first.

101
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:38,460
You hurried here now.

102
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:40,340
Where were you earlier?

103
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:43,620
Do you know that Ruoxi waited like a fool for you for days?

104
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,900
Why are you acting like this now for?

105
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:48,120
It was your fault and you dare to blame me!

106
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:49,920
I'm going to kill you!

107
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,040
Stop it! Stop it!

108
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,860
Because the envelope was written in your hand,

109
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:58,560
Imperial Brother thought you were writing to provoke him again so he threw it aside!

110
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,540
Even if he didn't receive her letter,

111
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:03,960
there are so many of your spies on this estate,

112
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:06,700
didn't they tell you about Ruoxi?!

113
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:09,240
You used so many tricks in the past,

114
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:13,340
it made Imperial Brother unwilling to hear any more reports about Ruoxi,

115
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:16,120
so do you still have to ask?!

116
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:28,320
Ah so, it was like that.

117
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,700
Ruoxi...

118
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:36,620
I didn't mean it.

119
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:39,760
That time under the plum trees,

120
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:44,220
when I had Ruoxi show intimate gestures to the spies,

121
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,820
it was only because my heart was hurt and suffocating,

122
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:51,580
and I wanted to anger you.

123
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:56,220
But I found out that I really did like speaking with Ruoxi

124
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:59,620
because it was like returning to the past.

125
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:03,740
Although, we were separated by a screen,

126
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,020
I knew that Ruoxi

127
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:09,300
was quietly laying there, I--

128
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:11,220
You shut up!

129
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:16,500
But why?

130
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:21,500
Why did you treat Ruoxi like this?

131
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:26,340
This is what Ruoxi begged for.

132
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:30,480
She begged me

133
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,700
to find a windy day

134
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:35,140
and spread her ashes on the wind.

135
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,340
This way, she'd be free.

136
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:41,200
She said she doesn't want any bad taste in her mouth.

137
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:45,900
She doesn't want to be buried in the dark earth. She was scared...

138
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:49,860
scared that she'd be bitten by worms.

139
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:05,860
Let us go home now.

140
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:16,600
Ruoxi is my Ce'Fu'jin!

141
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,080
You can't take her away!

142
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,940
I get to say if

143
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:21,820
she is your Ce'Fu'jin or not.

144
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:25,640
I never placed Ruoxi's name on the Imperial Family records

145
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,820
and you never had a marriage ceremony!

146
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:29,820
When Imperial Father passed away,

147
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:31,620
I couldn't see him one last time.

148
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:34,860
When Mother passed away, I also did not see her one last time!

149
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:36,900
Now you have come to take away my Ce'Fu'jin!

150
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,380
Don't bully me too far!

151
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:40,460
I will bully you!

152
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:48,720
Fourteenth Brother...

153
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,680
Please sympathize with Imperial Brother's feelings.

154
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:55,980
Moreover, I believe Ruoxi

155
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:58,760
is willing to leave with Imperial Brother.

156
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:01,580
What a joke! If she was willing

157
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:04,260
why would she leave the Forbidden City?

158
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,920
Fourteenth Prince...

159
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:09,460
It was Second Miss' own wish.

160
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,920
Let His Majesty take Second Miss away.

161
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:25,060
It's Second Miss' wish. Really.

162
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:26,700
Your Majesty,

163
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:31,860
please follow me.

164
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,100
Fourteenth Brother.

165
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:53,700
If you're really thinking for Ruoxi's own good,

166
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:56,420
stop making a commotion.

167
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:59,900
All of Ruoxi's sufferings,

168
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:03,120
her difficulties,

169
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:07,180
were for 8th brother, 10th brother,

170
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:09,140
and for you.

171
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:13,460
Now, she has already passed away,

172
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:18,660
don't make things difficult for her anymore.

173
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,180
Your Majesty, please.

174
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:55,520
Second Miss, every day she practiced her calligraphy.

175
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,680
She only stopped

176
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,420
when her hand had no more energy.

177
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:05,180
Your Majesty.

178
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:09,300
These were all written by Second Miss.

179
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:58,280
Also these,

180
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,300
belonged to Second Miss.

181
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:05,260
I was thinking to keep them for myself for remembrance,

182
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,660
but I think if I give these to Your Majesty

183
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:11,860
it will be much, much, better.

184
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:15,340
Before she left,

185
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:19,300
what did she say?

186
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:22,060
Second Miss thought that you hated her

187
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:25,160
and didn't want to see her.

188
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:28,500
So she didn't leave any words for Your Majesty.

189
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:35,860
You may leave.

190
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:23,940
Ruoxi...

191
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:52,700
Second Miss knew that Wang'ye would come back,

192
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:54,820
so she left a letter for you.

193
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:02,700
[ Thirteenth Prince,]

194
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:06,700
[ Rouxi knowing 13th Prince ]

195
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,460
[ was my good fortune. ]

196
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:13,380
[ I only have 13th Prince that I can ask for this favor. [

197
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:18,580
[ I know that doing this will give 13th Prince trouble. ]

198
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:20,580
[ But the Death Seeking 13th Prince of the past ]

199
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:22,860
[ would not be scared. ]

200
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:26,680
And this handkerchief,

201
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:30,660
Second Miss asked that it be given to 9th Prince.

202
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:47,180
Second Miss didn't leave behind very much money.

203
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:49,340
These things...

204
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:51,860
she told me to give half to Eunuch Wangxi,

205
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:53,260
but...

206
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:56,740
Not long after Ruoxi left,

207
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:59,920
Wangxi tripped and fell into the water and drowned.

208
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:03,460
He can't use these.

209
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:06,860
Second Miss also said

210
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:09,020
Wangxi was an intelligent person

211
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:10,576
and he wouldn't be able to use it.

212
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:14,540
So she told me to give this to his family in his stead.

213
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:19,500
Imperial Brother

214
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,860
already heavily rewarded his family.

215
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:24,925
What do you plan to do now?

216
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:28,820
Madam and Second Miss gave me their money.

217
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,180
Second Miss said

218
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:33,960
I should decide what I should do next.

219
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,582
I wish to serve Chenghuan Ge'ge. (Princess)

220
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:40,260
Second Miss also left this jade pendant for her.

221
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:49,580
That's good, I originally thought of that too,

222
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:51,480
but I didn't want to force you.

223
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,660
Since you're willing,

224
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:56,380
when I bring Chenghuan back to the estate

225
00:23:57,180 --> 00:24:00,440
I won't have to worry that no one will take care of her.

226
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,620
Thank you, Wang'ye.

227
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:08,980
Nian Gengyao

228
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:11,800
has already received Imperial Brother's edict.

229
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:14,020
He has also already accepted the title

230
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:15,540
and returned his acceptance to the emissary.

231
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:21,140
Imperial Brother.

232
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:24,780
If Ruoxi sees you like this,

233
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:27,643
she won't rest in peace.

234
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:31,349
The Empress has waited outside for a long time.

235
00:24:31,349 --> 00:24:34,340
She has never left your side.

236
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:38,533
Imperial Brother should appreciate her thoughts and actions now.

237
00:24:38,533 --> 00:24:39,980
I want to see the Emperor!

238
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:40,780
Wang'ye...

239
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:42,387
- Let me in!
-  Wang'ye...

240
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,500
Let him come in.

241
00:24:46,567 --> 00:24:47,960
Eighth Brother.

242
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,330
Ruoxi is no longer here,

243
00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:51,002
why are you causing a commotion?

244
00:24:51,002 --> 00:24:52,540
You should leave--

245
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:01,140
Ruoxi...

246
00:25:01,962 --> 00:25:04,144
came from my manor.

247
00:25:04,948 --> 00:25:06,606
Now that she's already gone,

248
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:08,980
why can't I

249
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:11,500
see her!

250
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:15,340
She is right here.

251
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:23,100
Now you've seen her.

252
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:26,880
Leave.

253
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,820
Why did you treat her like that?

254
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:31,420
Since you'd already let her leave the Forbidden City,

255
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:34,680
why couldn't you let her have a complete corpse and rest in peace?

256
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:35,780
8th Brother.

257
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:39,020
This was Ruoxi's own wish.

258
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:41,900
It's the truth.

259
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:44,700
She always had beyond ordinary thoughts.

260
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:47,180
Maybe this was the only way, she could

261
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:51,020
truly belong to her lover.

262
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:06,020
Back then, I gave up on Ruoxi because of power

263
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:08,660
and abandoned

264
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:11,460
the vows we made to never leave each other.

265
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:14,300
Now, Imperial Brother,

266
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:17,740
for the Qing empire

267
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:20,060
and your past grievances,

268
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:24,540
has also given up the chance to be together with her forever?

269
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:29,100
You're the same as me. The things you once had

270
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:34,740
are now all gone in the end.

271
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,380
With Ruoxi,

272
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:41,280
you're just the same as me,

273
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:44,160
a failure!

274
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,660
Leave.

275
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:52,460
I'm the Emperor of the Qing now.

276
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:55,660
LEAVE!

277
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,060
True,

278
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:06,620
you are the mighty Emperor,

279
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:10,260
but I

280
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,620
am still me after all.

281
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,700
Stripped of all titles and removed from the records.

282
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:30,420
Stripped of their yellow belts.

283
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:33,980
The wives of these two princes, if they have titles,

284
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:35,900
those titles are hereby revoked.

285
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:38,040
All of their children and grandchildren

286
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:42,180
are to be stricken from the Imperial Family records and are to be renamed.

287
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:45,860
8th Wang'ye's name is to be changed to A'qi'na,

288
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:47,780
meaning "to forever carry your crime".

289
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:50,340
Prince Hong Wang's name shall be Pu'sa'bao
(protected by Bodhisattva),

290
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:55,360
in the hope that the Yongzhen Emperor will be merciful like Bodhisattva and let Hong Wang live.

291
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,220
Since 9th Prince won't change his name himself,

292
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:59,940
Yongzhen Emperor has changed it to Sai'si'hei

293
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:01,900
meaning 'hateful devil.'

294
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:14,740
Ruoxi...

295
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:17,580
May your departure

296
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:22,220
take you to the free

297
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:25,900
and future world.

298
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:32,060
On 10th Brother's wedding night

299
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:35,420
I took Ruoxi to the countryside to drink.

300
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:38,260
When she was drunk,

301
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:39,940
she once told me

302
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:43,060
that she wasn't from this time period

303
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,780
but from a future world.

304
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,820
Back then, I thought she was being silly and funny.

305
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,740
As I think about it now,

306
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:55,740
I'm willing to believe

307
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:59,900
that she has returned to her own place.

308
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:05,700
I am not actually Ruoxi,

309
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:07,220
I am Zhang Xiao.

310
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:11,020
I don't belong to your world.

311
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:13,860
I am afraid that one day

312
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:16,780
I will leave here against my will.

313
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:21,380
Like how I originally didn't want to come here.

314
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:26,860
I hope that you really can return to your own time.

315
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:05,740
You're awake!

316
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:07,300
Doctor! Doctor!

317
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:08,640
- She's awake!
-  Awake?

318
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,860
Quick!

319
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:11,540
Here...

320
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:24,840
13th Brother, you have so much free time today,

321
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:26,380
that you won't admire the snow at home

322
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:28,500
so you came here to see me?

323
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:32,300
I am here to do someone a favor.

324
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:35,540
To give 9th Brother something.

325
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:15,860
Why is it not just hate?

326
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:21,020
Why?!

327
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:31,260
Ruoxi,

328
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:33,620
you deserve to be 4th's woman.

329
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:36,420
No, you're even more cruel than he is.

330
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:38,560
He can only torture our bodies,

331
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,660
so we can escape by dying.

332
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:42,740
But you

333
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:45,020
won't let me die in peace,

334
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:49,580
making me feel regret and sadness.

335
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,400
Don't block me!

336
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,660
You can't block me!

337
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:08,800
I have to go find that bastard Emperor!

338
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,220
Go! Go then!

339
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:12,100
Who would block you!

340
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:13,260
You said it!

341
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:14,940
You can't block me!

342
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:16,160
I have a score to settle with him!

343
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:18,140
Who is blocking you?

344
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:19,820
I... I...

345
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:22,220
I'll desecrate his ancestral tomb!

346
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:25,260
I... I'll yell at all of his ancestors so that they can't have peace!

347
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:30,539
Aren't his ancestors your ancestors?

348
00:34:30,539 --> 00:34:31,500
Aren't you scared

349
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:33,700
that your ancestors will come to attack you?

350
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:35,700
That's right...

351
00:34:37,539 --> 00:34:39,420
There's no use in continuing to act out this scene,

352
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:41,260
I can never out-talk you.

353
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:43,220
That's why it's meaningful.

354
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:44,400
Otherwise, it wouldn't be fun.

355
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,380
Alright. Come.

356
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:46,820
Come, sit and talk.

357
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:50,200
Come, sit down and talk.

358
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:53,700
Here, slowly.

359
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:56,380
I saw that you were play acting so happily,

360
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:57,819
so I didn't help you.

361
00:34:57,819 --> 00:34:58,539
Look at you,

362
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:00,900
your stomach is already so big,

363
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:02,619
but you don't know any control.

364
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,900
Oh, so you're worried now?

365
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:06,900
I'm not worried.

366
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:09,980
Let's

367
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:12,780
try to have 2 kids in 3 years.

368
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:15,340
Who cares what 4th Brother is doing?

369
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,360
I don't have time to bother with him anyway.

370
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,700
That's right!

371
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:55,580
Your chess skills have improved.

372
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,020
You are so at ease now,

373
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,060
it's really like

374
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:10,820
the clean and pure De Fei of the past.

375
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:12,220
Of course,

376
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,380
I should thank Imperial Brother,

377
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:17,940
for putting me in house-arrest in Mother's palace,

378
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:19,900
and giving me such a peaceful place.

379
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:23,320
Now, every day, I can pray to Mother,

380
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:25,780
look at the books she often read.

381
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:27,700
It is like returning to the past.

382
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:29,780
There is nothing to worry about.

383
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:31,700
I only have to care about how to enjoy each day.

384
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:32,860
No matter what,

385
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:34,620
Mother is here to protect me.

386
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:38,480
Out of all of us brothers,

387
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:39,780
it looks like

388
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:43,020
your days are spent the best.

389
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:44,580
Yes.

390
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:46,040
There's 13th Brother

391
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:48,340
to play chess with and talk to often.

392
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:50,740
There's Fu'jin to speak comforting words.

393
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:53,340
There isn't a hint of loneliness.

394
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:57,980
Now that I think about it,

395
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:01,580
the throne that I spent half my life fighting for,

396
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:05,380
doesn't compare to these comfortable days.

397
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:20,400
Won't His Majesty punish you?

398
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,480
I will go tell His Majesty

399
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:25,100
that this is what Ruoxi wanted before she died.

400
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:28,140
Even if His Majesty gets angry,

401
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,500
he won't say much.

402
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:35,540
After I leave,

403
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,820
if I have a complete corpse

404
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:40,740
could you

405
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:43,740
bury me with Minghui's ashes?

406
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:46,300
If I am cremated,

407
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:47,820
then could you

408
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:51,500
mix her ashes with mine?

409
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:54,060
In life, I couldn't

410
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:56,520
be with her forever.

411
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:58,500
So in death

412
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:01,820
I hope to fulfill her wish.

413
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:09,140
Hongwang...

414
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:11,780
His Majesty will not punish Hongwang,

415
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,100
so don't worry, 8th Brother.

416
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:16,660
As long as I'm here

417
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:18,940
I will protect him.

418
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:23,380
In this lifetime, I cannot repay back

419
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,180
all that 13th Brother has done for me.

420
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:09,500
Thank you, Ruoxi.

421
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:54,180
Father.

422
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:57,260
Qiaohui...

423
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:59,140
I'm here.

424
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:00,940
Chenghuan...

425
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:07,140
continue... to take care... of her for me.

426
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:13,860
Don't worry, Wang'ye.

427
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:21,140
4th Brother,

428
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:26,960
your brother cannot

429
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:30,740
assist you any longer.

430
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:41,460
We brothers have walked this path together,

431
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:45,020
do we really need to say such things?

432
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:52,260
When Ruoxi left,

433
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:55,660
she didn't want us

434
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:58,780
to remember her,

435
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:07,260
but, actually, no one has forgotten her.

436
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:12,420
Let's

437
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:21,460
all meet again in our next life.

438
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:26,140
Father!

439
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:29,980
Father!
Wang'ye!
Father!

440
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:32,180
Wang'ye!

441
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:37,340
Father!

442
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:51,980
Father!

443
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:10,100
雍正
(Yongzheng)

444
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:38,060
They have all left.

445
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:43,420
There's now only me.

446
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:09,260
13th year of Yongzhen's reign, August 23rd of the lunar calendar, Yongzhen passed away. He is buried in the Western tombs.

447
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:39,680
After searching all over the place,

448
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:42,500
I still can't find a hint of Maertai Ruoxi's existence.

449
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:44,340
It's almost as if this person

450
00:43:44,340 --> 00:43:47,020
never existed in history.

451
00:43:47,580 --> 00:43:48,820
Unless,

452
00:43:48,820 --> 00:43:50,480
those ten plus something years

453
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:52,100
and the relationship with 4th Prince

454
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:54,060
weren't real at all?

455
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:56,620
