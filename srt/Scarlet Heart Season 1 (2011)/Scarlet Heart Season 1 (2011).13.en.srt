2
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:19,400
♫  In the blink of an eye, a thought of stubborn persistence  ♫

3
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,590
♫  We were destined to seek our doom like moths flying towards the flame  ♫

4
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:30,880
♫  Knowing that it’d be a disaster, why am I still at a loss about what to do  ♫

5
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:38,550
♫  The best is not to see, the best is not to miss you  ♫

6
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:43,650
♫  Only like this can I not be in love with you  ♫

7
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:47,560
♫  Just another brushing of the shoulder, and from then...♫

8
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:53,410
♫  I’ll keep falling deeper and deeper in love with you  ♫

9
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:57,910
♫  It’s the mistake of time,  ♫

10
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:01,590
♫  forcing us to pass each other by  ♫

11
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:05,270
♫  How I miss you, how far you are  ♫

12
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:07,620
♫  Even though I’d known it’d only result in pain, ♫

13
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:11,550
♫  at this moment, I still don’t want to escape  ♫

14
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:15,970
♫  Pity these words are too glaring they hurt the eyes  ♫

15
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,040
♫  Two worlds later ♫

16
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:25,080
♫  Don’t want to escape  ♫

17
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:27,530
♫  It’s the mistake of time,  ♫

18
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:30,550
♫  we can only pass each other by  ♫

19
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:35,100
♫  The magnitude of me missing you is as much as how far you are   ♫

20
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:41,150
♫  Even though I know the ending is a mistake that I cannot oppose  ♫

21
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:46,170
♫  Staying in this moment  ♫

22
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:54,610
♫  We can only accept that the feelings run deep, but fate is shallow  ♫

23
00:01:57,674 --> 00:02:01,812
Scarlet Heart
Episode 13

24
00:02:22,776 --> 00:02:24,314
This is...

25
00:02:34,686 --> 00:02:37,480
I really wonder where Eighth Prince got so many flowers from.

26
00:02:37,728 --> 00:02:40,661
Even though sending flowers is cliche to me,

27
00:02:40,825 --> 00:02:42,054
having someone try to get in your good graces

28
00:02:42,054 --> 00:02:43,865
will still make you feel touched.

29
00:02:45,609 --> 00:02:46,868
Jiejie!

30
00:02:46,868 --> 00:02:48,958
Eunuch Zhang had people bring these over just now.

31
00:02:48,958 --> 00:02:50,615
Is there anything we can use them for?

32
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:54,059
There are a lot of uses!

33
00:02:54,184 --> 00:02:57,124
To brew tea, to soak in baths, to put in your hair.

34
00:02:57,288 --> 00:02:59,128
At least it's better than using dried flowers.

35
00:02:59,803 --> 00:03:01,220
That's true.

36
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,350
Who am I?

37
00:03:17,743 --> 00:03:19,229
Fairy of the Grass Plains.

38
00:03:20,323 --> 00:03:23,460
I am a human-eating demon!

39
00:03:28,975 --> 00:03:31,397
So it was the Jasmine Fairy.

40
00:03:56,971 --> 00:03:57,980
Ruoxi,

41
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:00,956
do you know how happy I am?

42
00:04:01,792 --> 00:04:04,949
Are you happier than when you first saw Jiejie?

43
00:04:15,886 --> 00:04:17,660
It's different.

44
00:04:20,716 --> 00:04:22,100
When I first saw Ruolan,

45
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:24,570
it's true that I was surprised and overjoyed.

46
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,020
After Imperial Father bestowed marriage upon us,

47
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:28,940
I felt I was very happy.

48
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:31,063
One-sidedly,

49
00:04:31,063 --> 00:04:33,660
I liked the Ruolan of my imagination.

50
00:04:34,819 --> 00:04:38,642
I never even thought whether or not my first impression was accurate.

51
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:42,696
I only thought

52
00:04:42,696 --> 00:04:44,609
about possessing the clear, bright sound of her laughter.

53
00:04:45,995 --> 00:04:48,420
But when I lifted Ruolan's veil,

54
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:52,202
I knew I was wrong.

55
00:05:00,733 --> 00:05:04,801
Ruoxi, I've already committed a mistake.

56
00:05:04,801 --> 00:05:06,900
How can I make the same mistake twice?

57
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,740
I remember,

58
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:11,740
before Tenth Brother's wedding banquet, you asked me

59
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:13,260
why one's own fate

60
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:15,004
has to be decided by another.

61
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,465
I knew then

62
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:19,973
that you and Ruolan were different.

63
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,201
Ruoxi,

64
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,660
do you know all these years,

65
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:30,220
how much I've missed you?

66
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,860
I wanted you to willingly,

67
00:05:36,786 --> 00:05:39,100
happily marry me.

68
00:05:40,067 --> 00:05:41,700
I don't want Ruolan's incident

69
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,860
to repeat another time.

70
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,930
But it's always so difficult to guess your heart.

71
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:50,600
I felt that you had me in your heart,

72
00:05:51,383 --> 00:05:52,780
but I didn't understand

73
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:54,780
why you kept rejecting me.

74
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:57,660
I didn't know what I should do

75
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:00,380
to make you willing.

76
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:11,220
Don't look at me like that.

77
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:16,140
Why do you always look at me with such a gaze?

78
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:27,211
Four years ago, when you were still a little girl,

79
00:06:28,218 --> 00:06:30,355
you'd use this gaze that was full of sorrow

80
00:06:30,355 --> 00:06:32,312
and pity to look at me.

81
00:06:33,048 --> 00:06:35,192
What on earth are you sad about?

82
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,160
I don't want to lose you.

83
00:06:40,182 --> 00:06:42,960
I want you to always be well.

84
00:06:44,408 --> 00:06:46,151
You won't lose me.

85
00:06:46,848 --> 00:06:50,517
I will always stay by your side.

86
00:06:52,351 --> 00:06:53,651
Really?

87
00:06:58,542 --> 00:07:00,060
Did you hear me?

88
00:07:00,564 --> 00:07:02,260
Did you or did you not hear me?

89
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,860
That year you made me stand as a punishment,

90
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:14,131
you bullied me.

91
00:07:14,131 --> 00:07:16,886
When a gentleman seeks revenge, ten years isn't too late.

92
00:07:47,547 --> 00:07:49,511
Come, help me move some firewood over.

93
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,701
Miss Ruoxi.

94
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,700
Greetings to the Crown Prince.

95
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,220
You're excused.

96
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,060
Miss Ruoxi,

97
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:02,908
you seem to be quite busy these days.

98
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:07,984
I heard that in this recent period, Miss Ruoxi

99
00:08:07,984 --> 00:08:10,360
and Eighth Brother have been seeing each other very frequently,

100
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:13,140
and often go off together to ride horses too.

101
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:15,440
Your Highness,

102
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,100
I don't know which silly person you've heard that from.

103
00:08:17,397 --> 00:08:19,540
Eighth Prince and I have always kept in contact.

104
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,940
Besides, the horseback riding was consented to by His Majesty.

105
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:24,177
Eighth Prince just happened to see that I was eager to learn it well

106
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:26,200
and it was only for me not to let down His Majesty's grace,

107
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,440
that he's teaching me to ride.

108
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,260
So that's how it is.

109
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:33,300
It's nothing. You may go back to your work.

110
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,098
Your servant takes her leave.

111
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,259
All of these are foods I love to eat!

112
00:08:50,259 --> 00:08:52,540
Even the fish has had it's skin peeled off before being served.

113
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:54,180
it must have been difficult for the chef.

114
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:56,885
Eighth Prince, actually you didn't have to do this.

115
00:08:56,885 --> 00:08:59,660
Food that you don't like isn't necessarily the food I like either.

116
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:04,100
I bumped into the Crown Prince today.

117
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:06,380
He has some suspicions about us.

118
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:08,700
And I was wondering what had happened.

119
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:12,020
Suspect if he likes. I didn't plan to hide it from him anyway.

120
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,300
Moreover, we're going to return to the capital very soon.

121
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:17,340
Once we get back, we should get our matters (marriage) done.

122
00:09:19,603 --> 00:09:23,420
He's just wary of you since you now serve by Imperial Father's side.

123
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:26,420
After all, if you're willing to say something,

124
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:28,420
you can help save us a lot of trouble

125
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:30,660
in guessing what's on Imperial Father's mind.

126
00:09:33,349 --> 00:09:34,880
You should eat first.

127
00:09:52,531 --> 00:09:55,180
All of these are the Crown Prince's and Fourth Prince's people.

128
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,040
Nian Gengyao.

129
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:02,580
Nian Gengyao?

130
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:09,300
Why do you always care so much about matters related to Fourth Brother?

131
00:10:13,148 --> 00:10:16,631
Probably... because of my relationship with Thirteenth Prince.

132
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:20,160
As you know, both of us have always been close,

133
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,980
so I'm concerned about Fourth Prince's matters as well.

134
00:10:26,316 --> 00:10:29,340
Is this the list of His Majesty's newly re-allocated officials?

135
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:30,680
Yes.

136
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,980
But the edict to reassign Nian Gengyao hasn't been sent out yet.

137
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:35,780
It's probably only going to be sent out when we return to the capital.

138
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:37,520
Is the re-allocation this time

139
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:40,153
advantageous or disadvantageous to you?

140
00:10:40,153 --> 00:10:41,660
It's neither good nor bad.

141
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:45,660
Luckily, Fourteenth Brother came in time, otherwise, it'd be a different name list than we have now.

142
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:48,640
Then is Nian Gengyao's assignment

143
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,800
good or bad for you?

144
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,940
If you didn't ask,

145
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:00,420
I fear that I wouldn't have been able to sleep well tonight.

146
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:04,140
Now that you asked, I am relieved.

147
00:11:05,323 --> 00:11:07,340
He's no more than a well-dressed servant.

148
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:10,620
To decide whether he's good or not right now would be placing him in too high a regard.

149
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:13,120
After all, we need to give Fourth Brother some benefit.

150
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,980
First, it follows Imperial Father's intentions.

151
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:19,720
Secondly, it benefits us too.

152
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:22,580
After all, he's helped us quite a bit in the capital this time.

153
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:25,480
Fourth Prince would help you guys?

154
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,560
What are you pondering over?

155
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,220
But I really want to know,

156
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:32,220
you normally don't pay attention to such (political) matters,

157
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:34,460
how would you know Nian Gengyao?

158
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:40,700
He comes from lowly beginnings and has a low official ranking.

159
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,860
Right now, in the capital, it's true that he isn't anyone notable.

160
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:47,800
But I've heard Thirteenth Prince mention him a few times,

161
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:50,280
praising him as an intelligent and open-minded man,

162
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:54,260
eloquent in speech and writing, and is very good at getting things done.

163
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:59,720
Given his background and to be on the verge

164
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:02,080
of being promoted to Inspector General of Sichuan.

165
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,500
Given, Fourth Brother gave him a helping hand,

166
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:08,140
but he himself, has also gained face for Fourth Brother.

167
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,380
Your father kept your brother by his side.

168
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:15,740
It's such a pity. Otherwise,

169
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:18,860
as long as he had a fraction of your intelligence and thoughtfulness, and was willing to work hard,

170
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:22,312
Imperial Father would probably have an even higher regard for him.

171
00:12:22,312 --> 00:12:25,040
And I wouldn't need to be here envying Fourth Brother.

172
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:32,380
My heart isn't stone, it can't be turned by others.

173
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:37,060
My heart isn't cloth, it can't be rolled by others.

174
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:41,120
Through the happiness and sorrow of this lifetime, we'll promise each other

175
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:47,620
to hold each other's hand and grow old together.

176
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:51,640
I definitely won't let down your feelings for me.

177
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:01,240
Ruoxi,

178
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,860
who'd have thought that we'd have to separate again so soon.

179
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:04,880
Princess,

180
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,200
I believe that in the near future,

181
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,660
we'll be able to see each other again.

182
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:08,840
You are right.

183
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,340
But it really was unexpectedly fun this time!

184
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:14,480
Even though he didn't come,

185
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,280
it's indeed the only imperfection.

186
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:23,380
Ruoxi, when you go back to the palace,

187
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:25,460
remember to help ask Thirteenth Prince on my behalf.

188
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:27,120
I know.

189
00:13:28,567 --> 00:13:30,671
Princess, my lord is asking you to go back.

190
00:13:30,671 --> 00:13:32,536
I understand.

191
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:36,137
Ruoxi, Bei'le, I'll take my leave first.

192
00:13:36,137 --> 00:13:37,400
We'll see you again, Princess.

193
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,449
Until next time then.

194
00:13:45,239 --> 00:13:46,958
We'll be returning to the capital soon.

195
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:50,951
Before we leave, is there anything else you want to do or any place you want to go?

196
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:54,109
I want to go to the places where we've been and take a walk around.

197
00:13:54,109 --> 00:13:55,463
All right.

198
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:08,111
What do you want to say? Just tell me directly.

199
00:14:13,034 --> 00:14:15,502
If I ask you to do something for me,

200
00:14:15,502 --> 00:14:17,553
will you be able to agree to it?

201
00:14:17,903 --> 00:14:21,321
Ruoxi, do you still need to ask something like this?

202
00:14:21,321 --> 00:14:25,420
Whatever you ask for, I will definitely do everything in my power to do as you wish.

203
00:14:25,937 --> 00:14:27,544
If

204
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:30,700
I ask you to give up vying for the throne?

205
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:36,321
Will you be able to agree to that?

206
00:14:43,577 --> 00:14:45,556
I don't think this matter

207
00:14:45,556 --> 00:14:47,824
has anything to do with with us (as a couple).

208
00:14:47,824 --> 00:14:49,400
If you promise,

209
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:52,480
we will be together;

210
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,480
if you don't,

211
00:14:56,587 --> 00:14:58,645
then we'll break up.

212
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:03,869
You're tired. Go back and rest well.

213
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,120
I'm serious!

214
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,351
I'm very clear-headed.

215
00:15:09,637 --> 00:15:10,620
These past few days,

216
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:13,320
haven't we been very happy?

217
00:15:14,009 --> 00:15:18,026
We can be like this in the future too.

218
00:15:21,641 --> 00:15:23,188
During spring,

219
00:15:23,499 --> 00:15:26,140
we can go to the countryside together to gaze at flowers.

220
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:28,079
During summer,

221
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:30,600
we can coast around the lake in a boat.

222
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,460
During autumn,

223
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:35,960
we can gallop across the green grasslands.

224
00:15:36,642 --> 00:15:38,100
During winter,

225
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:40,796
we can sit around the brazier, enjoy the snow, and paint plum blossoms.

226
00:15:41,657 --> 00:15:44,651
We can read and write poetry.

227
00:15:44,861 --> 00:15:47,140
We can also visit misty Jiangnan,

228
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:49,560
and the desolate Northern Regions.

229
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,860
I also know how to make many dishes.

230
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:55,180
Many of these dishes,

231
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:58,580
that besides me, few others in the entire Qing Dynasty would know how to make.

232
00:15:58,580 --> 00:15:59,700
I also know...

233
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:01,360
These past few days,

234
00:16:03,003 --> 00:16:05,880
you've had an agenda all along,

235
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:08,060
right?

236
00:16:14,845 --> 00:16:17,460
Every tune you sang for me,

237
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:20,780
every word you said to me,

238
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,720
was it all just for today?

239
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:26,660
My feelings for you

240
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:31,000
definitely don't contain a shred of pretence.

241
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:35,900
You know it.

242
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:38,900
There's you in here.

243
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:43,281
You know it. You know it!

244
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,240
Ruoxi,

245
00:16:47,486 --> 00:16:48,960
why?

246
00:16:50,511 --> 00:16:53,716
I still remember what you said back then very clearly.

247
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,649
Why must one's destiny

248
00:16:56,649 --> 00:16:58,708
be decided by someone else?

249
00:16:58,708 --> 00:17:01,360
Why can't one decide on his or her own destiny?

250
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:06,040
Back then, although I scolded you,

251
00:17:06,542 --> 00:17:08,520
in my heart,

252
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:11,732
I thought exactly the same.

253
00:17:14,719 --> 00:17:17,795
Because my mother came from lowly beginnings,

254
00:17:17,795 --> 00:17:21,360
when I was young, I was often treated with a cold shoulder.

255
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:25,480
All these years, I've carefully plotted every step and made every effort,

256
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,360
just so that I could take my own destiny

257
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:29,535
into my own hands.

258
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:34,060
We are all princes. Why can the Crown Prince do it and I can't?

259
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:37,440
If his abilities were remarkable, then I would have nothing to say.

260
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,680
But in terms of capability and virtue, in which way is he able to convince the masses?

261
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:45,160
It's just because his mother was the Empress most loved by Imperial Father.

262
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:48,380
Since he was born, he was able to get everything!

263
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:50,840
I refuse to accept that.

264
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:56,080
Do you know?

265
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,860
From being valued by none to now, when no one dares to underestimate me,

266
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:00,420
how much I've worked and sacrificed?

267
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:02,860
In order to get Ninth, Tenth, and Fourteenth Brother follow me,

268
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:04,220
#

269
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:06,340
how much effort and thought did I spend on them?

270
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,460
I don't have the support of relatives,

271
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:10,200
and can only make friends with court officials.

272
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:13,500
How much more effort did I spend on that?

273
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:17,880
Vying for the throne is fraught with danger.

274
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:21,719
I just want to be together with you for the rest of my life.

275
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:25,720
I have my own reasons that I can't reveal.

276
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:30,540
It wasn't easy for me to decide to be together with you.

277
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:36,418
I just want, that from now on,

278
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:40,504
my heart can stay by your side.

279
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,320
I want the throne,

280
00:18:56,108 --> 00:18:58,337
and I want you too.

281
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:11,080
Stop entertaining foolish thoughts.

282
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:14,320
Go back and rest well.

283
00:19:23,422 --> 00:19:26,200
Rest well?

284
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:29,160
How can I rest well?

285
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:33,420
What am I to do?

286
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:48,860
Master, ever since we arrived at the away palace
(palaces emperors reside in when travelling)

287
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:51,260
you've buried yourself in working on court matters.

288
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:53,380
Tomorrow, we'll have to continue on our journey to rush back again.

289
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:57,037
If you don't rest more, your body might not be able to sustain itself.

290
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,120
In the capital,

291
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:02,860
a few months time is sufficient for tremendous change to happen.

292
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:07,740
Although there are Ninth Brother, Fourteenth Brother and the respective officials in the palace,

293
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:11,780
there are many matters in which I still have to personally see to and make the final decision.

294
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:13,600
How can I rest?

295
00:20:14,522 --> 00:20:17,440
Master, if not because you're more hardworking than others in all matters,

296
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,852
how else would you have obtained the fine name, Virtuous Eighth Prince?

297
00:20:20,852 --> 00:20:22,858
Since Master isn't tired,

298
00:20:22,858 --> 00:20:25,312
why not allow your servant to go invite Miss Ruoxi

299
00:20:25,312 --> 00:20:26,759
to come over to accompany you for a meal?

300
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:29,824
It's been a long time since Master has met with Miss.

301
00:20:33,005 --> 00:20:34,559
I'd rather

302
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:37,510
concentrate on taking care of work matters. There's no need.

303
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:55,784
Since that night, Eight Prince never came to look me up again.

304
00:20:56,295 --> 00:20:58,777
I know that Fourth Prince will ascend the throne,

305
00:20:58,777 --> 00:21:02,140
but if I tell Eighth Prince, will he believe me?

306
00:21:03,007 --> 00:21:05,620
Saying that my soul is from 300 years in the future,

307
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:07,749
and that I know what happens in the future.

308
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:10,768
He will probably either think that I've gone mad,

309
00:21:10,768 --> 00:21:13,036
or that I'm a demon.

310
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:16,580
I've already been foolish once,

311
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:19,452
vainly attempting to capture a man's heart.

312
00:21:19,849 --> 00:21:22,199
Why would I be Bai Suzhen from another time,
(A kind snake demoness who fell in love with a mortal)

313
00:21:22,199 --> 00:21:24,480
testing a man who supposedly loves you

314
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,015
to see if he is able to accept an unconventional person?

315
00:21:28,294 --> 00:21:31,660
Not afraid of him going to find a Fahai to vanquish me?
(Monk who defeated Bai Suzhen)

316
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,400
Jiejie.

317
00:21:43,872 --> 00:21:45,200
Yutan,

318
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:49,234
if you know that someone is going to die,

319
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:51,020
and you want to save him,

320
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:53,840
but he won't listen to you,

321
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,760
what would you do?

322
00:21:57,897 --> 00:22:00,000
Jiejie.

323
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,584
I'm talking nonsense.

324
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:08,520
Jiejie, how do you know he will die?

325
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:11,525
Would telling him about it prevent him from dying?

326
00:22:13,594 --> 00:22:15,340
I am me,

327
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:17,966
not Maertai Ruoxi.

328
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,722
I want to live for myself.

329
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,040
Let's go!

330
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:24,995
Why are you dragging me

331
00:22:24,995 --> 00:22:26,300
here in such a hurry?

332
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:27,549
- I'm not going!
- You're not going?!

333
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,340
Hurry up!

334
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:30,700
It's broken!

335
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:32,160
- Hurry up!
- Be more gentle!

336
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,500
I say, Eighth Brother is only going to come back tomorrow.

337
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:36,880
Why am I coming here today?

338
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,860
You also, know that they're coming back tomorrow?

339
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:40,720
Then do you know how busy my sister is?

340
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,240
Isn't it only natural for us to come over to help?

341
00:22:43,696 --> 00:22:46,260
Tomorrow, His Majesty and company are coming back to the capital!

342
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:49,860
Then do you know how happy I am

343
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:51,960
or how unhappy I am?

344
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:55,560
What does your happiness have to do with me?

345
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,960
Are you an idiot?

346
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,640
Idiot?!

347
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:02,380
Fine then, let me tell you.

348
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:03,800
I'm happy

349
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:06,460
because Eighth Prince is coming back tomorrow

350
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:09,645
and can be together with Jiejie again, of course.

351
00:23:09,645 --> 00:23:10,880
I'm not happy

352
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:13,440
because of that good Ruoxi of yours, of course.

353
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:16,420
Both of you can see each other day and night again.

354
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:19,860
Ruoxi is going to be back soon?

355
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,800
You're not happy?

356
00:23:28,432 --> 00:23:31,125
You're not happy, but I'm very happy!

357
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:32,420
Idiot!

358
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:34,380
I swear I'll yank your queue off!
(Queue - man's long braid)

359
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:35,060
Don't run!

360
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:37,200
- Hurry and come hit me!
- You!

361
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,680
Hit me!

362
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:41,420
Jiejie, we've only just come. Where are you going?

363
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,432
Bei'le's mother, Concubine Liang,

364
00:23:43,432 --> 00:23:44,732
has suddenly fallen ill.

365
00:23:44,732 --> 00:23:46,404
I need to go into the palace immediately to visit her.

366
00:23:46,661 --> 00:23:49,562
I'll leave the matters of this residence to you two first.

367
00:23:54,881 --> 00:23:57,642
Mother, careful that it's too hot.

368
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:02,665
Minghui,

369
00:24:03,394 --> 00:24:05,660
to have you personally taking care of me,

370
00:24:06,157 --> 00:24:08,393
how can I trouble you like this?

371
00:24:08,393 --> 00:24:11,319
Mother, taking care of mother

372
00:24:11,319 --> 00:24:13,734
is what I, as your daughter-in-law, should do.

373
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:18,564
Mother, I've long heard that

374
00:24:18,564 --> 00:24:21,071
the palace allotments aren't equal again.

375
00:24:21,071 --> 00:24:25,020
Nonetheless, Mother is very generous.

376
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:27,260
I feel that the other Imperial consorts and concubines

377
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:30,040
do not have Mother's magnanimity.

378
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:39,229
All these Imperial consorts and concubines were born with a higher status than mine.

379
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,923
If not for me being very lucky

380
00:24:41,923 --> 00:24:43,927
to have received the emperor's affection,

381
00:24:43,927 --> 00:24:46,120
I'm afraid I would still have been a servant.

382
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:49,000
And how would I have been able to enjoy what I have today?

383
00:24:49,787 --> 00:24:51,900
Mother is His Majesty's concubine,

384
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:54,100
and the mother of Bei'le.

385
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:55,892
Furthermore, Bei'le

386
00:24:55,892 --> 00:24:57,782
is the Eighth Virtuous Prince, loved by the people,

387
00:24:57,782 --> 00:24:59,460
and the hope of many people.

388
00:24:59,872 --> 00:25:02,020
It's only natural for you to have all this.

389
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:05,212
You should proudly gaze down upon the rest of the concubines.

390
00:25:07,342 --> 00:25:09,392
Speaking of Eighth Prince,

391
00:25:09,949 --> 00:25:12,875
if only he had a mother from a prestigious family.

392
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,290
He would have been held in high esteem because of his mother,

393
00:25:15,290 --> 00:25:17,798
and wouldn't have to come off second best in everything,

394
00:25:17,798 --> 00:25:20,034
and suffer all kinds of grievances.

395
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:23,560
It's all my fault.

396
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,018
No!

397
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,940
This has only made Bei'le become stronger and know better what is or isn't appropriate.

398
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,900
Mother, do you still remember?

399
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,900
When he was conferred the title of Duoluo Bei'le by his Majesty,

400
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:37,220
he was only 17 years old.

401
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:41,500
At that time, all the princes were jealous of him.

402
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:44,826
In court, Bei'le is very accomplished.

403
00:25:44,826 --> 00:25:48,309
This is also something that the other princes are miles behind him in.

404
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,540
Minghui.

405
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,700
Other people are held in high esteem because of their mother,

406
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:55,380
but Bei'le doesn't need that.

407
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:56,860
If we're comparing family prestige,

408
00:25:56,860 --> 00:26:00,620
my Guoluoluo family definitely won't let Bei'le lose the fight.

409
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:02,340
Rest assured, Mother.

410
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:04,940
The day when Mother is going to be held in high esteem because of her son

411
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:06,792
isn't far off.

412
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:09,640
To be able to marry such a

413
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:12,040
loyal and virtuous wife like you

414
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:14,300
really is Eighth Prince's good fortune.

415
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,940
To be married to someone

416
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:18,704
who's worth me wholeheartedly doing everything for him,

417
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:21,629
it's the blessing of my life.

418
00:26:21,762 --> 00:26:23,580
I always thought that

419
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:25,460
a woman's happiness

420
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:28,300
comes from gaining her husband's love and concern.

421
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:32,060
I really hope that Eighth Prince

422
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:34,780
properly treasures you.

423
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,163
Thank you, Mother.

424
00:26:41,993 --> 00:26:43,180
Jiejie!

425
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:44,020
Mingyu?

426
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:45,080
It's already this late,

427
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:46,680
how is it that you haven't returned to the Tenth Prince's residence yet?

428
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,360
Aren't I waiting for you?

429
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,280
You've been running around all day,

430
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,720
hurry and rest for a bit.

431
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:52,920
Serve tea for the Mistress.

432
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,080
Yes.

433
00:26:57,380 --> 00:27:00,400
Jiejie, you told me to take care of the matters in the residence,

434
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,520
how could I just run off?

435
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:05,720
Unlike that idiot Tenth,

436
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:08,280
saying something about going out to buy fruit to help me quench my thirst?

437
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:10,520
And he hasn't come back since!

438
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:13,840
Seems like this Tenth Brother

439
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,960
isn't as stupid as you make him out to be.

440
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,360
Jie!

441
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,760
Why are you still taking his side?

442
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:23,720
Mingyu, Tenth Brother is your husband.

443
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:26,240
Even if everyone on earth is spitting on and cursing at him,

444
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,080
you still have to defend him.

445
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,600
This is what you should do.

446
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,240
I know.

447
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:35,720
Just like how you treat Bei'le,

448
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,080
But

449
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:39,640
I'm afraid I don't have the patience.

450
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:41,360
Look at you.

451
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,320
This residence has been so well-organized by you,

452
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:45,920
and managed so flawlessly.

453
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,400
To say that I came to help today,

454
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:50,000
actually I didn't do anything.

455
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,360
And not just that.

456
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,600
Jiejie, even the external matters...
(matters that occur outside of the residence)

457
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:59,200
You may all take your leave.

458
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,800
Yes.

459
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:10,520
If you have something to say, go ahead and say it.

460
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:14,960
Jiejie, actually regarding this matter,

461
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,640
I also heard it from that id--

462
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:19,640
that Tenth Prince. He told it to me.

463
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:22,680
I heard that recently, Bei'le

464
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:28,400
seems to be working even harder than before to win over court officials and expand his influence.

465
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,080
I'm guessing...

466
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,680
I'm guessing...

467
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,840
his ambition isn't just this much.

468
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,320
Jiejie,

469
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:39,640
if it's like this, will you still support him?

470
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:41,440
Haven't I already said?

471
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,880
This is my duty as a wife.

472
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:49,440
I will support him to the best of my abilities,

473
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:53,520
regardless of how ambitious he is,

474
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:56,480
even if his goal

475
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,400
is aimed toward that throne.

476
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:05,240
It's Miss Ruoxi, please come in.

477
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:07,800
Master, Miss Ruoxi is here.

478
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:16,960
Yes.

479
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:47,960
We'll be back in the capital tomorrow.

480
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:50,720
I will ask Imperial Father to grant the marriage as soon as possible.

481
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:53,400
Have you agreed to what I asked?

482
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:06,800
Once there's an Imperial decree, how can you still be allowed to mess about?

483
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,680
Even if you've manage to get an Imperial decree,

484
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:11,440
if I don't want to marry,

485
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,440
no one will be able to force me.

486
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:15,220
At most,

487
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:17,720
I'll cut my hair and become a nun.

488
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,240
If it really comes down to it,

489
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:21,440
there's I also have three feet of white cloth.
(cloth traditionally used to hang oneself)

490
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,600
I really don't understand.

491
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:27,580
Why would you rather die than marry me?

492
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:29,520
It's not that I'm not willing to marry you,

493
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,960
I just hope

494
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:34,760
that you won't fight for the throne.

495
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:38,040
Then, I don't understand this even more.

496
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:40,080
What does marrying me

497
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:43,200
have to do with me agreeing to your request?

498
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:48,120
The contention for the throne is fraught with peril.

499
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:51,080
If you succeed, it's true that you'll attain the position above all others.

500
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:52,800
But if you fail?

501
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:54,480
If you're lucky,

502
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,320
then you'll just be like First Prince,

503
00:30:56,320 --> 00:31:01,120
staying in solitary confinement for life. But if you're unlucky...

504
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,320
If...

505
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:06,160
it means you'll lose your life,

506
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:08,400
will you still fight for it?

507
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:14,040
The winners will be crowned, the losers vilified. If you're willing to bet, you should also be willing to concede defeat.

508
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:16,640
After all these years of planning and hard work,

509
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:20,320
if you want me to give up right now, it's definitely impossible.

510
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,980
Let's not say that compared to the Crown Prince,

511
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:23,760
I have a bigger chance of winning.

512
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:26,160
Even if I had no hopes of winning,

513
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:28,640
I would still try to fight for it.

514
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:32,400
Why can't you be like Fifth Prince?

515
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:35,200
Doesn't he have an outstanding literary talent as well?

516
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,320
Isn't he very knowledgeable as well?

517
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:44,240
If in future, when I ascend the throne, I allow you to be the Empress,

518
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:49,560
would you be willing to accompany me on this bet?

519
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:52,600
I never thought about being the Empress.

520
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:54,600
Stop.

521
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:08,240
Turn around.

522
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:19,760
For the sake of not marrying me,

523
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:22,280
you're willing to even threaten me with taking your own life.

524
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:25,720
But why

525
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:28,240
can't you risk life and death by my side?

526
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:30,320
I'm scared.

527
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:34,400
I'm scared that we won't have a future.

528
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:12,180
Jiejie,

529
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:16,640
are you deliberately mixing the tea leaves to see what flavor they'll produce?

530
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:32,880
Those that shouldn't be mixed together,

531
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:35,040
but are forcibly mixed together,

532
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:38,320
the result can only be bitter.

533
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:45,080
Jiejie,

534
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:47,240
is there something bothering you?

535
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:50,180
I just read a story,

536
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:51,720
and the emotions elicited by it provoked me to say this.

537
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,740
Jiejie, what story did you read?

538
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:55,040
I want to hear it too.

539
00:33:58,220 --> 00:33:59,220
Have you ever seen

540
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:01,680
the story of Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai?
(Butterfly Lovers)

541
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:03,000
I've seen it.

542
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:07,000
It talks about a couple who love each other but cannot be together.

543
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,720
And so in the end, it was only after they died and morphed into butterflies that they could be together.

544
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:14,600
If you love someone,

545
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:17,040
but know that your time together with him is limited,

546
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:20,880
would you still be willing to risk everything and be together with him?

547
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:22,240
In this sea of people,

548
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:25,119
for two people to be able to meet each other, get to know each other, and fall in love with each other,

549
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:26,840
it's an affinity that's hard to come by.

550
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:27,840
That's right.

551
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:30,159
Rather than spend my whole life with a person I don't like,

552
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:33,599
I'd rather be with a person I like for one day.

553
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:37,420
Is that so?

554
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:41,980
Who knows how long one can be with the person they love?

555
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:43,420
Jiejie,

556
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:45,539
it's just a story.

557
00:34:46,579 --> 00:34:48,099
I'm probably thinking too much about it.

558
00:34:48,099 --> 00:34:50,740
Can you bring over some tea leaves for me?

559
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:55,140
Is what they said true?

560
00:34:55,140 --> 00:34:57,780
As long as you're together with the one you like,

561
00:34:58,220 --> 00:35:00,460
even just a day of happiness,

562
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:04,420
you would be willing even if you would be in pain for the rest of your life?

563
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:11,620
These past few days, I've been constantly asking myself why.

564
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:14,220
Why can't I be like Yutan and the others?

565
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:16,660
And accompany Eighth Prince in life and death?

566
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,740
If I decide to be with Eighth Prince,

567
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:23,820
we still have 16 years to be together.

568
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:25,940
Ruoxi,

569
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:29,100
is it because it's only 16 years,

570
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:33,140
or is it because you don't love him enough?

571
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:44,360
Mother!

572
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,400
Careful, don't fall!

573
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:47,980
If your father sees, he'll worry again.

574
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:57,020
Greetings to Eighth Fujin.

575
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:58,500
Greetings to Tenth Fujin.

576
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,580
Rise.

577
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:03,260
If Fujin doesn't have any further instructions

578
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:04,940
then I will take my leave first.

579
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:05,580
Mother,

580
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:07,980
she looks very similar to Aunt (referring to Ruolan).

581
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:11,820
They're sisters, of course, they look alike.

582
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,220
You persons are all bad ones who bully my mother!

583
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:20,700
Since you all bully my mother, I'll bully you!

584
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:24,140
Us? Doesn't that include Jiejie?

585
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:26,220
What did they do to Jiejie?

586
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:29,260
Who'd have thought that such a situation would finally come to play?

587
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:31,220
Hong Wang, what are you doing?

588
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:32,540
Hurry and come back.

589
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:36,460
It seems Fujin doesn't have any other instructions,

590
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:37,620
I'll take my leave then.

591
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:40,380
Jiejie, I've long told you,

592
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:43,060
she's an unmannered barbarian.

593
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:46,940
Whenever her sister sees you, she is well-mannered.

594
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:50,180
But, her, a palace maid, shows no regard for law or status?

595
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,220
Stop!

596
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:55,260
Who allowed you to leave?

597
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:58,700
As they say, the country has its laws, and the palace its own rules.

598
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:01,540
No matter how lowly my status is, I'm still a servant of Qianqing Palace.

599
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:03,540
If you want to punish me,

600
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:06,300
feel free to inform Eunuch Li of the areas of my misconduct,

601
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:08,740
Eunuch Li will naturally do as the rules dictate.

602
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:12,140
Don't tell me that you want to personally punish me here?

603
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:14,620
Greetings to Fourth Prince.

604
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:17,940
Greetings to Fourth Prince.

605
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:21,040
All rise.

606
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,460
If Fourth Prince doesn't require anything,

607
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:24,340
then I will take my leave.

608
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:25,940
Go.

609
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:33,220
Why do you keep making use of someone who treats you sincerely

610
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:34,980
to bully someone who only chants Buddhist scriptures

611
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:37,140
and won't fight with you at all?

612
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:40,420
Hiding behind the scenes and pretending to be virtuous.  Is there a point?

613
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:12,940
Is your health all right?

614
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:15,860
Why don't you know how to take care of yourself?

615
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:18,740
It's raining and you still go wandering around.

616
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:19,900
It's nothing.

617
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:21,740
I came to find you today

618
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:23,980
because I had something to ask.

619
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:26,260
According to young Lord Hong Wang,

620
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:28,100
often goes to find trouble with Jiejie.

621
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:29,820
Is this true?

622
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,060
When did Hong Wang say this?

623
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:34,020
It matters not when he said it.

624
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:35,900
What's important is the content.

625
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:38,980
It's nothing but a child joking.

626
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:40,500
You believe that too?

627
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:44,540
Children's words are the most truthful.

628
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:48,700
Hong Wang will occasionally go bother Ruolan,

629
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:50,180
but Ruolan herself says that

630
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:52,020
children always fool around.

631
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:53,740
She doesn't mind at all.

632
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:56,420
You, on the other hand, are putting forth an accusatory manner.

633
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:57,780
What are you trying to get at?

634
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:00,820
Hong Wang is your only child.

635
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:02,900
If you love and spoil him, that's your due.

636
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:05,300
But if someone is making use of the child to bully others,

637
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:06,860
and you pretend not to see,

638
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:08,960
isn't that too much?

639
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:11,060
How do you know I've never said anything to Hong Wang?

640
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:13,140
How much do you know about the matters of my residence

641
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:14,540
to proclaim me guilty?

642
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:17,220
I have no interest at all about the matters of your residence.

643
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:19,260
Jiejie is someone who minds her own affairs,

644
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:21,380
I hope that you can protect her well.

645
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:23,780
As for whether or not Hong Wang is just a child fooling around,

646
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:26,540
it's best that you clarify it yourself.

647
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:36,380
What's happened to us?

648
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:38,500
Weren't we fine on the grasslands?

649
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:40,460
Why can't you be like you were then?

650
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:42,820
It's already hard enough for us to see each other,

651
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:44,860
must you still argue with me?

652
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:49,820
On the grasslands, there was only you and I.

653
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:51,380
There wasn't an Imperial throne,

654
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:53,340
nor your wives,

655
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:54,820
nor your son.

656
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:59,060
Now that there's so many people and matters lying between us,

657
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,780
how can it be the same?

658
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:11,500
I will ask Hong Wang.

659
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:13,260
Don't fly into such a rage

660
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:15,660
just because of the words of a child

661
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:17,860
#

662
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:22,920
If you're really so worried about Ruolan,

663
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,780
then marry me as soon as possible.

664
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:26,740
Isn't that better?

665
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:29,660
That way, won't you be able to see her every day?

666
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:31,580
With you by her side,

667
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:34,500
who would still dare bully Thirteenth Sister's Jiejie?

668
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:36,460
Wouldn't they be scared of being slapped?

669
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,060
You still haven't decided?

670
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:50,700
I'm really confused about you.

671
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:53,660
I really don't understand what you're thinking.

672
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:56,700
I don't believe that you're a coward who's only concerned about saving your own skin.

673
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:00,420
What in the world are you hesitating over?

674
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,980
Do you really have such little faith in me?

675
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:06,460
Or is there another reason?

676
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:11,720
Give me a little more time, please?

677
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:14,240
Let me think about it a little more.

678
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,120
I'm not Xiang Yu,
(Warlord who lost the fight to be emperor and committed suicide)

679
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:23,640
and I definitely won't allow you to become Consort Yu.
(Xiang Yu's beloved concubine)

680
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:34,840
Bei'le,

681
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:36,920
do let him get up.

682
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:42,220
Get up.

683
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:44,040
Who allowed you to get up!?

684
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:49,420
He was only fooling around.

685
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:51,840
He just kicked her once.

686
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:54,500
How much strength can a little child have?

687
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:55,760
Besides,

688
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,740
how hurt can Ruoxi be?

689
00:41:57,740 --> 00:41:58,860
Do you still remember?

690
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:01,700
Once, Hong Wang was mischievous,

691
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:03,460
and he overturned the candlestick,

692
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:05,540
a few drops of candle wax were dripped onto the back of his hand.

693
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:07,580
Originally, it wasn't anything much either,

694
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:10,040
but you punished an entire wing of servants.

695
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:11,260
Those who were the most severely punished

696
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:13,620
couldn't even get out of bed for three months.

697
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:15,800
But right now, because of Ruoxi--

698
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:17,320
I'm not just doing this because of Ruoxi,

699
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:19,180
I'm also doing this for her sister.

700
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:22,860
Children cannot use fooling around as an excuse

701
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:24,620
to do as they please.

702
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:30,100
Hong Wang, go outside first.

703
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:50,140
I don't understand

704
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:52,740
what you meant by the words you just spoke.

705
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:58,620
You often use excuses to find trouble with Ruolan, right?

706
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:04,540
However, she likes to put it.

707
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:06,900
Believe what she says then.

708
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:10,060
Must I hear it from someone else to know of it?

709
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:13,820
Hong Wang is just a piece of blank paper.

710
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:15,800
Regardless of what the reason is,

711
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:17,940
I don´t want this piece of paper

712
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:19,580
to have any stains.

713
00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:21,700
Then what about between us?

714
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:24,460
Are there any stains?

715
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:44,660
Greetings to Bei'le.

716
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:45,900
Dispense with the formalities.

717
00:43:46,620 --> 00:43:47,820
This cloth

718
00:43:47,820 --> 00:43:50,480
is a rare tribute from Jiangnan, moon silk.

719
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:52,300
You can use it to make clothes.

720
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:54,580
Thank you very much, Bei'le.

721
00:43:54,580 --> 00:43:56,700
But it's not suitable for me.

722
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:59,380
why don't you present Buddha with borrowed flowers,
(re-gifting a present someone else gave to you)

723
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:02,220
and give it to Jiejie (Eighth Fujin) instead?

724
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:05,140
You treat Minghui so well.

725
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:06,980
I don´t really understand

726
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:09,060
why does she always have to make things difficult for you.

727
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:12,300
No, Jiejie doesn't make things difficult for me.

728
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:14,980
Jiejie has always treated me well.

729
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:17,620
Don't speak up for her.

730
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:21,140
But I'm partially responsible as well.

731
00:44:21,140 --> 00:44:24,220
Cultivating oneself, order in the family, order in the nation, brings peace to the world.

732
00:44:24,220 --> 00:44:27,020
Just the second step and it's already beyond me.

733
00:44:27,020 --> 00:44:30,180
Bei'le, you're thinking too much.

734
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:34,820
How your days have been since you've married me,

735
00:44:34,820 --> 00:44:36,620
I know.

736
00:44:42,860 --> 00:44:46,100
I feel, it's been hard on you.

737
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:47,900
No,

738
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:50,420
everyone's treated me well.

739
00:44:54,340 --> 00:44:56,420
Is this what you want?

740
00:44:59,380 --> 00:45:02,580
There are some things I didn't want to explain.

741
00:45:02,580 --> 00:45:04,220
What's past is past.

742
00:45:04,220 --> 00:45:07,980
I thought that it was only me who suffered from it,

743
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:10,100
but later, I realized

744
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:13,180
that it only deepened the gap between us,

745
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:15,140
and your pain.

746
00:45:21,740 --> 00:45:24,100
He wasn't killed by me.

747
00:45:26,620 --> 00:45:27,940
He?

748
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:36,580
Ever since you married me,

749
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:39,060
I've never seen you truly smile.

750
00:45:39,060 --> 00:45:42,380
I kept asking myself why.

751
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:45,220
Later,

752
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:48,460
I sent someone to Xibei to find out,

753
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:51,220
only then did I find out the reason.

754
00:45:55,140 --> 00:45:56,900
The person that I sent to investigate

755
00:45:56,900 --> 00:45:59,100
alerted your father.

756
00:45:59,100 --> 00:46:01,140
Your father, in order to get him away,

757
00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:03,020
sent him to be the vanguard.

758
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:05,340
Later...

759
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:11,300
Even though it wasn't my idea.

760
00:46:11,620 --> 00:46:13,620
And even though I didn't kill him,

761
00:46:13,620 --> 00:46:15,660
he still died because of me.

762
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:18,820
After that, I began to understand

763
00:46:21,620 --> 00:46:26,540
that your heart had already been buried alongside him.

764
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:29,820
Even if I win everyone else under the sky,

765
00:46:30,660 --> 00:46:33,500
I cannot hope to win over him.

766
00:46:42,780 --> 00:46:45,620
Having to spend your life facing someone you hate,

767
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:47,860
compared to

768
00:46:47,860 --> 00:46:50,180
spending your life with someone you have no feelings for,

769
00:46:51,340 --> 00:46:53,140
It's even harder.

770
00:46:56,300 --> 00:46:58,140
I hope that after you know this,

771
00:46:59,380 --> 00:47:01,020
you won't hate me anymore.

772
00:47:27,370 --> 00:47:32,150
♫ Stopping here, afraid to go any further,  ♫

773
00:47:33,290 --> 00:47:38,120
♫ so sorrow will be unable to make an appearance  ♫

774
00:47:39,610 --> 00:47:45,060
♫  On the next page, the farewell penned by you,  ♫

775
00:47:45,950 --> 00:47:51,430
♫  it was not up to me to refuse  ♫

776
00:47:52,030 --> 00:47:57,870
♫  We’ve walked down this path too hastily  ♫

777
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:04,790
♫  Embracing desires that weren’t realistic  ♫

778
00:48:05,380 --> 00:48:11,930
♫  Not in time, wasn’t able to wait long enough to look back and admire  ♫

779
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:16,580
♫  The fragrance of magnolia is unable to hide wounds  ♫

780
00:48:17,310 --> 00:48:23,110
♫  No longer looking for the sun’s rays peeking through the clouds  ♫

781
00:48:23,710 --> 00:48:29,430
♫  No longer looking for the paradise that we promised each other  ♫

782
00:48:30,180 --> 00:48:36,130
♫  No longer sighing, you once said that life is unpredictable  ♫

783
00:48:36,180 --> 00:48:44,940
♫  The three inches of sunlight that I was unable to borrow  ♫

784
00:48:46,510 --> 00:48:52,390
♫  No longer looking for the sunlight peeking through the clouds  ♫

785
00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:58,830
♫  No longer looking for the paradise that we promised each other  ♫

786
00:48:59,420 --> 00:49:05,300
♫  No longer sighing, you once said that life is unpredictable  ♫

787
00:49:05,330 --> 00:49:11,750
♫  The three inches of sunlight that I was unable to borrow  ♫

788
00:49:12,420 --> 00:49:19,850
♫  That paradise is the place where I’d loved you  ♫
