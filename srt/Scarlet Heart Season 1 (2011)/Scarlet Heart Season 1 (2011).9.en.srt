00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:19,650
♫  In the blink of an eye, a thought of stubborn persistence  ♫

3
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:23,900
♫  We were destined to seek our doom like moths flying towards the flame  ♫

4
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:30,360
♫  Knowing that it’d be a disaster, why am I still at a loss about what to do  ♫

♫  The best is not to see, the best is not to miss you  ♫

♫  Only like this can I not be in love with you  ♫

7
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:48,220
♫  Just another brushing of the shoulder, and from then...♫

8
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:54,170
♫  I’ll keep falling deeper and deeper in love with you  ♫

9
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:58,070

Scarlet Heart
Episode 9

24
00:02:22,167 --> 00:02:25,633
Your Majesty, you were too worked up,

25
00:02:25,633 --> 00:02:27,633
that's why your qi couldn't flow smoothly.

26
00:02:27,633 --> 00:02:31,800
Later, I will get you some calming medicine.

27
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,533
After taking the medication, Your Majesty should rest well,

28
00:02:34,533 --> 00:02:36,167
then you will naturally recover from the illness.

29
00:02:36,167 --> 00:02:39,600
But extreme emotions will harm your health. Grief and anger--

30
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,467
Imperial Father, your son is unfilial!

31
00:02:41,467 --> 00:02:43,233
I was unable to help share the burden of your worries!

32
00:02:43,233 --> 00:02:45,267
Even when the Crown Prince did things disgraceful to the country,

33
00:02:45,267 --> 00:02:47,600
- I deserve to die!
- Fourth Prince.

34
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,100
I am here.

35
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:51,400
Find someone to keep watch over the Crown Prince.

36
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:56,400
As for the rest of the matters, do as you see fit.

37
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,600
Your son receives your orders.

38
00:03:09,567 --> 00:03:11,400
Fourth Brother,

39
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,767
regarding this matter of the Crown Prince,

40
00:03:12,767 --> 00:03:14,533
how are you planning on dealing with it?

41
00:03:15,467 --> 00:03:16,700
This isn't an easy task.

42
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:20,667
The Crown Prince, he was just asking for it.

43
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:22,700
Are you still going to defend him?

44
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,333
Thirteenth Brother.

45
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:25,667
What I'm saying is the truth.

46
00:03:25,667 --> 00:03:27,233
The Crown Prince is arrogant and wilful.

47
00:03:27,233 --> 00:03:30,667
Even though Imperial Father and you try to help and protect him,

48
00:03:30,667 --> 00:03:32,100
even after so many lessons, he hasn't improved,

49
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:33,800
continuing to act recklessly and brazenly.

50
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,733
This time, he did something that embarrasses our country and humiliated our Imperial Father.

51
00:03:36,733 --> 00:03:39,133
Even Imperial Father wants to punish him severely.

52
00:03:39,133 --> 00:03:42,133
Fourth Brother, are you still going to defend him?

53
00:03:42,133 --> 00:03:43,800
The deposing of him this time

54
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,100
might be the result of Imperial Father's momentary anger.

55
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:48,400
No one can predict what changes will take place in the future.

56
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,067
We should just do what we're told

57
00:03:50,067 --> 00:03:52,367
and follow Imperial Father's orders.

58
00:03:52,367 --> 00:03:54,933
As for other matters, there's no need for us to meddle with them.

59
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,100
Just now, outside Qianqing Palace,

60
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:07,733
I saw the ministers talking about the Crown Prince being deposed.

61
00:04:07,733 --> 00:04:10,633
Even the Internal Minister Wang who's always been calm and collected

62
00:04:10,633 --> 00:04:12,133
was busy trying to learn of the latest news.

63
00:04:12,133 --> 00:04:13,500
He didn't even watch where he was going

64
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,100
and bumped right into Minister Feng.

65
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:16,967
His Minister hat almost fell off!

66
00:04:16,967 --> 00:04:18,700
It made me laugh so hard!

67
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:19,767
Really?

68
00:04:19,767 --> 00:04:21,733
How could Minister Wang have been so lacking in decorum?

69
00:04:21,733 --> 00:04:23,867
Usually, Minister Wang's so strait-laced,

70
00:04:23,867 --> 00:04:25,133
wouldn't he have been very embarrassed?

71
00:04:25,133 --> 00:04:26,233
That is of course!

72
00:04:26,233 --> 00:04:27,767
That really is so funny!

73
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:28,967
We might think it's funny,

74
00:04:28,967 --> 00:04:30,667
but the Ministers certainly don't think so.

75
00:04:30,667 --> 00:04:33,133
Just because of this matter of the Crown Prince's deposal?

76
00:04:34,267 --> 00:04:36,633
This matter of his deposal is no small matter!

77
00:04:36,633 --> 00:04:37,900
With the position of Crown Prince empty,

78
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:41,333
the Ministers are all contemplating on which prince's camp they should side.

79
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,000
They only have one betting chip,

80
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,640
so they mustn't put their bets on the wrong person.

81
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,840
Naturally, they're floundering as to what to do.

82
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,240
But surely we can't be without a Crown Prince?

83
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,560
Sister, in your opinion, which prince do you think is the most likely to become the Crown Prince?

84
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,760
Eighth Prince of course!

85
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,680
When His Majesty gave him the job of supervising state affairs,

86
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:59,100
all the ministers praised him for being both capable and virtuous,

87
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,560
and that he has the makings of a good Emperor.

88
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,560
I don't agree.

89
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,400
Fourteenth Prince is handsome and extraordinary

90
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,600
and he's also good at fighting wars.

91
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,440
I think that Fourteenth Prince is the most likely one.

92
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,120
You're wrong. If we're talking about bravery,

93
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,120
Thirteenth Prince is just as brave as Fourteenth Prince.

94
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,160
Actually,

95
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,320
the First Prince is still the First Prince.

96
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,560
If we go according to seniority, it might be First Prince.

97
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,000
In your opinion,

98
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,920
which prince do you think is the most suitable.

99
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,180
As to who will be Crown Prince,

100
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:22,720
within His Majesty's heart, he definitely has ideas of who to appoint.

101
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,920
It's not something for us servants to discuss.

102
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,080
We need to only know our place

103
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,380
and make sure our work is properly done.

104
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:29,800
No matter who becomes the master,

105
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,200
we should do our best to take care of him.

106
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,000
Talk less and do more work.

107
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,320
Don't be a busybody.

108
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,240
What an apt saying. "Don't be a busybody".

109
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,360
- Eunuch Li.
- Teacher.

110
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:43,720
All of you should learn from Rouxi.

111
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,680
Thanks for your praise, Eunuch Li.

112
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,840
I just want to live peacefully.

113
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,760
There are still many matters

114
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,360
in which I will need Eunuch Li to teach me.

115
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,680
You already know to act discreetly so as to keep yourself safe,

116
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,620
what else do you need me to teach you?

117
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:57,160
In the palace, it's hard to predict one's future,

118
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:00,000
I'll still need Eunuch Li to take good care of me in many matters.

119
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,620
All right. All of you get on with your work.

120
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:05,360
Yes.

121
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:12,200
Ruoxi!

122
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,600
- Greetings to Fourteenth Prince.
- Excused.

123
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:31,660
Although Eighth Brother has many matters that are keeping him busy,

124
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:32,840
he insistently reminded me

125
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,520
to pass this letter to you.

126
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,140
He even insisted that I hand it to you personally,

127
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:37,320
and ensure that you receive it in good condition.

128
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,960
In my opinion, to Eighth Brother,

129
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,400
you are just as important as state affairs.

130
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:57,500
T/N Note: "Magpie Bridge and the Fairy" by Song Dynasty poet, Qin Guan, about The Weaver Girl and the Cowherd of folktales .

131
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,880
[The clouds in the sky form unique shapes; shooting stars send messages of longing ].

132
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,820
[ Silently, they cross the wide Milky Way. ]

133
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:06,280
[The delight of meeting that autumn night ]

134
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:09,000
[ surpasses all the joy on earth. ]

135
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,808
[ Moments of tender love, ]

136
00:07:11,808 --> 00:07:13,900
[ the meeting is like a beautiful dream. ]

137
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:16,280
[ Parting, the sight of the magpie bridge is unbearable. ]

138
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,880
[ But if one's love is true and lasting, ]

139
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:23,760
[ why is there a need to be together every day? ]

140
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:55,995
Your Majesty, your tea is getting cold.

141
00:07:55,995 --> 00:07:58,247
I will change it to fresh hot tea for you.

142
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:10,960
Your Majesty.

143
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,568
No need to pick them up.

144
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:19,040
Your Majesty!

145
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,760
These petitions are all requesting me to

146
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,840
rescind my order to depose the Crown Prince.

147
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,600
It's just as well that I don't read them.

148
00:08:33,193 --> 00:08:33,880
Reporting to Your Majesty.

149
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,280
Third Prince is requesting an audience

150
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:35,920
Let him in.

151
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,200
Yes.

152
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,000
Ruoxi, serve tea.

153
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,400
Yes.

154
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:57,040
Third Prince is requesting an audience?

155
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,320
What could the reason be?

156
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,529
You say the Crown Prince's abnormal mentality these days,

157
00:09:02,529 --> 00:09:04,967
that resulted in his spoilt and immature behaviour,

158
00:09:04,967 --> 00:09:07,520
had all been a scheme covertly planned by First Prince?

159
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,400
That's right.

160
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,800
Do you have any evidence?

161
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:13,340
I heard this all from the eunuch in Big Brother's Residence.

162
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:14,760
Big Brother and a few other Lamas
(Lama - Tibetan Buddhist monk )

163
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:15,860
have been closely consorting with each other.

164
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:17,049
And he has been using the Lamas

165
00:09:17,049 --> 00:09:19,420
to secretly cast witchcraft to hurt Second Brother.

166
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:22,120
It has caused Second Brother to lose his mind.

167
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,840
If you knew about that,

168
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:26,260
why didn't you speak out earlier?

169
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:27,600
It's because I'm foolish.

170
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,240
I thought that I shouldn't believe in spirits and ghosts.

171
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,680
Also, I didn't expect

172
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,600
that Big Brother would have the intention of taking the Crown Prince's place.

173
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,720
That's why even though Big Brother and the Lamas consorted closely with each other,

174
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,240
I didn't think too much about it

175
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,920
all the way up until Second Brother started acting out abnormally.

176
00:09:40,401 --> 00:09:44,020
And then only after I got confirmation from the eunuch at Big Brother's residence

177
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:46,320
did I dare report this matter to you.

178
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:53,700
If there was a single lie in what you said,

179
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,760
I definitely won't forgive you easily.

180
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,980
If there was a single lie in what I said,

181
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:01,040
I'm willing to be punished in any way Imperial Father pleases.

182
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,360
Send out my orders

183
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,240
to search the First Prince's Residence.

184
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,680
Yes.

185
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,000
What are you doing? Move aside! Move aside!

186
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,200
Split up and search!

187
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,280
Yes!

188
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,200
Master, bad news.

189
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,040
First Prince, please!

190
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,520
What are you guys doing?

191
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,100
What are we to do?

192
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,640
Don't be afraid. I am here.

193
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,440
Hurry and go. Hurry up.

194
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:35,160
Hurry... Hurry and search.

195
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,260
Stand properly.

196
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:44,640
Tell me! What is this?

197
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,640
This grass figure

198
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,600
was found in your residence.

199
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,600
On this straw doll, is the Crown Prince's birthdate.

200
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,040
What do you have to say for yourself?

201
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:54,920
Imperial Father

202
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,600
I was just temporarily overcome with a greed for power,

203
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,600
that's why I did such a heinous act.

204
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:01,740
I know that I'm wrong now.

205
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:03,040
Please forgive me, Imperial Father.

206
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,440
As the eldest,

207
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,120
you should have set a good example.

208
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,980
But for the sake of power and the throne,

209
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:10,640
you were heartless,

210
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,400
and used despicable methods

211
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,240
to harm your own kin.

212
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,760
If I let you off easily,

213
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,360
I will not be fulfilling my responsibilities as head of this family

214
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,480
and as a ruler of this country.

215
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,020
Send out my orders

216
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:22,800
to strip him of all his titles

217
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,480
and remove him from all his responsibilities.

218
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,140
He will be demoted to commoner status

219
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:28,600
and be sent to the Zong Residence to be imprisoned forever.
(the "jail" royals get sent to when they commit a crime)

220
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,520
Imperial Father!

221
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,520
Drag him out!

222
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,360
Spare your son!

223
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,720
Spare me, Imperial Father.

224
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,560
Imperial Father, I know my mistake!

225
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:42,440
Imperial Father!

226
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,340
Imperial Father,

227
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:44,780
regarding the matter of Second Prince being unvirtuous,

228
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:45,780
we've already found out the truth

229
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:47,480
he did all those things because of First Prince.

230
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,280
I plead with  Imperial Father to

231
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,640
pardon Second Prince of his crime.

232
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:59,280
I'm very tired today. Dismissed.

233
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,760
Your sons bid you farewell.

234
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:09,760
Li De Quan.

235
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,840
Your Majesty.

236
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,600
Send for Li Guangdi.

237
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,880
Yes.

238
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,820
The Emperor has ordered

239
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:20,840
to send for Li Guangdi to come and see him.

240
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,520
Jiejie.

241
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:32,360
Do you know that His Majesty has found out that the Crown Prince's unvirtuous behavior has been all because First Prince had cast witchcraft?

242
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:33,800
This matter

243
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,120
has been the talk of the Palace,

244
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,640
how could I not know?

245
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,120
Who knew that witchcraft could cause a person to go mad.

246
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,640
It's really scary.

247
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,720
How could His Majesty be so silly as to believe in things like witchcraft?

248
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,240
In my opinion,

249
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:50,240
His Majesty just wants to find an excuse to forgive the Crown Prince,

250
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,000
so that he'll be able to reinstate the Crown Prince in future.

251
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,880
You're saying that the Crown Prince will be reinstated?

252
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,320
I'm just making conjectures anyhow.

253
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,360
Don't take it to heart.

254
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,680
Try this new tea that I just brewed.

255
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,800
What you say makes sense too.

256
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:08,440
Today, His Majesty summoned Li Guangdi, Minister Li, to see him.

257
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,440
He summoned Minister Li?

258
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,560
I overheard their discussion regarding the matter of selecting a new Crown Prince.

259
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,320
I also heard Minister Li recommending that the Eighth Prince

260
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,680
should be the next Crown Prince.

261
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,120
Jiejie.

262
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,140
How's the taste?

263
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,200
It's very fragrant.

264
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,440
His Majesty still loves the Crown Prince.

265
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,760
But now, Li Guangdi's suggestion that Eighth Prince take over as Crown Prince

266
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:50,360
will definitely make His Majesty suspect that Eighth Prince intends to vie for the throne.

267
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,320
That's very bad for Eighth Prince.

268
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,760
No way. I can't just stand by and watch him get into trouble.

269
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,560
I must remind him not to act rashly.

270
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:20,840
Although this letter of mine can be a reminder for Eighth Prince,

271
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:25,120
history is still history.

272
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,800
History will not change because of anyone.

273
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,920
Reporting to Your Majesty, Second Prince is here. He's waiting outside to have an audience with you.

274
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,560
- Summon him.
- Yes.

275
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:40,560
My respects to Imperial Father.

276
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,280
All of you are dismissed.

277
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:52,320
Rouxi, stay back outside to wait.

278
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:59,640
Imperial Father.

279
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:03,040
Imperial Father, I know my mistake now.

280
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:07,600
Even if he's a wise Emperor, he's still a father.

281
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:14,000
It seems like His Majesty will be softhearted, the Crown Prince being forgiven is only a matter of time.

282
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:28,440
Your Majesty, you've been busy with work for the whole day,

283
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,880
Rouxi prepared some tea and snacks for you.

284
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,040
All right.

285
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:39,880
Your Majesty.

286
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:43,280
The snacks today were specially made with the lotus flower petals

287
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:46,520
that Your Majesty admired this summer. They were dried and then ground into powder.

288
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,760
It retains the light and elegant fragrance of the lotus flowers.

289
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:49,960
Try it, Your Majesty.

290
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,319
Your Majesty.

291
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,720
What did you add in this tea?

292
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,680
Why is there a taste of bitterness

293
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,320
in the dry sweetness?

294
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,460
- I...
- Your Majesty,

295
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:44,660
Ruoxi has asked me before

296
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:47,720
if she could use gingko leaves to make tea.

297
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:50,920
I've asked her and she replied

298
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:54,080
that lately, His Majesty has been coughing a little,

299
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,760
and is a little overheated.

300
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:59,280
Because it wasn't serious, you didn't pay much attention to it.

301
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:02,440
So why not use soaked gingko leaves to make tea.

302
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:05,620
It's simple and effective.

303
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:09,680
Your humble servant consulted Imperial Physician Wang too. He said it's alright to do this.

304
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:13,040
That's why I approved her suggestion.

305
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:20,680
Rouxi, you really are observant.

306
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:26,120
Even to me, you're so concerned,

307
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:29,400
it goes without saying how you treat your own parents.

308
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,400
With a daughter like you,

309
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:36,640
your parents are really blessed.

310
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:50,480
Ever since Imperial Father punished First Prince for casting witchcraft on Second Prince,

311
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,120
more Ministers have petitioned

312
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:56,080
Imperial Father to reinstate him as Crown Prince.

313
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:59,540
But Imperial Father did not make any response to these petitions.

314
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:02,560
It means that Imperial Father doesn't have the intention to reinstate Second Brother at all.

315
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:05,620
Did Imperial Father say this personally?

316
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:07,280
This is what I guessed!

317
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,080
None of us know Imperial Father's mind.

318
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:13,740
Guessing anyhow will only cause you to make the wrong decision.

319
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:16,400
Eighth Brother! Eighth Brother.

320
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,920
I just got some news,

321
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:23,820
a few days ago, Imperial Father met with Second Brother in private.

322
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:25,940
Then did Imperial Father say anything?

323
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:27,800
Is the Crown Prince going to get reinstated or not?

324
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,320
I don't know.

325
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:33,320
I only know that Imperial Father and Second Brother met behind closed doors.

326
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:36,100
After that, Imperial Father sent Second Brother back to his residence to be imprisoned,

327
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:38,480
and there's no more news after that.

328
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,360
Seems like Imperial Father is going to reinstate the Crown Prince.

329
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:42,600
We should petition Imperial Father to stop him immediately.

330
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,240
Tenth Brother, don't be rash.

331
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,500
Eighth Brother, this is urgent.

332
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,700
If we continue to wait, we're going to miss this good opportunity.

333
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:50,680
That's right, Eighth Brother.

334
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:56,660
If Imperial Father had decided to reinstate Second Brother, there would have been news of it by now.

335
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,700
Does Eighth Brother mean to say that

336
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:01,080
Imperial Father is still undecided?

337
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:05,080
Do you want us to just sit here and surrender the Crown Prince position?

338
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,080
That's right.

339
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:09,840
What Eighth Brother means is that we should sway Imperial Father's decision,

340
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:13,160
but it shouldn't come directly from us.

341
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:16,440
Go around the palace and gather more news.

342
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:19,280
Check and see which Minister is unhappy with Second Brother,

343
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,440
and give them a push.

344
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:25,360
Have them write petitions to oppose Second Brother's reinstatement,

345
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:29,240
and make Imperial Father reconsider,

346
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:32,840
so as to give us more time.

347
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,840
- Bring me wine.
- Yes.

348
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:54,060
Based on the rate that you are drinking, sooner or later, you will finish all the wine in my residence.

349
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:55,580
What should I do otherwise?

350
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:57,560
You don't allow me to go into the palace,

351
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:58,800
and you don't allow me to find out news about what's happening.

352
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,080
What else can I do besides drinking?

353
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,840
I'm doing this for your own good.

354
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:05,920
Right now, everyone knows that Imperial Father met  with Second Brother.

355
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,560
Everyone is speculating

356
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,400
that it won't be long before the Crown Prince will be reinstated.

357
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,640
There are rumors flying around everywhere.

358
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,880
I don't want you to get involved in this mess.

359
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,880
That's why I asked you to stay away.

360
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,520
Not get involved so as to steer clear of trouble.

361
00:21:18,523 --> 00:21:21,080
I don't care if Second Brother can be reinstated or not.

362
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:23,720
- I just...
- I know you mean well for me.

363
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,520
Don't worry.

364
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:27,940
Reporting to Master.

365
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:30,720
Internal Minister Wang Donghai seeks an audience.

366
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:37,120
Tell Minister Wang that I contracted the flu and that I am ill. It wouldn't be convenient for me to meet him.

367
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,280
Yes.

368
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,415
Fourth Brother,

369
00:21:44,415 --> 00:21:48,120
Minister Wang is well known for his wide connections.

370
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,577
Now that he's suddenly asking to see you,

371
00:21:49,577 --> 00:21:51,481
it must be because he has some news.

372
00:21:51,481 --> 00:21:52,982
So why aren't you seeing him?

373
00:21:52,982 --> 00:21:55,800
Minister Wang can guess anybody's mind,

374
00:21:55,800 --> 00:22:00,080
but if he can't guess Imperial Father's mind, it'd be useless.

375
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:03,440
If Imperial Father got to know that I met him,

376
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,540
Imperial Father will think that we are colluding together.

377
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:07,760
That will only ruin matters.

378
00:22:09,277 --> 00:22:11,395
Then we'll just keep to the residence,

379
00:22:11,395 --> 00:22:13,763
and wait for things to fall from the sky, and not do anything else.

380
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,880
I'm getting bored to death.

381
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,500
Thirteenth Brother,

382
00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:22,960
after so many years, have you yet learned the meaning of this word?

383
00:22:27,812 --> 00:22:29,483
Wait.

384
00:22:34,376 --> 00:22:36,980
Since the time when His Majesty met with Second Prince,

385
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:40,220
Second Prince's house arrest has continued for quite some time.

386
00:22:41,799 --> 00:22:44,500
In the blink of an eye, it's (Lunar) New Year's Eve again.

387
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:48,400
I only hope that this year will pass safely.

388
00:22:50,699 --> 00:22:51,907
Jiejie!

389
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:57,628
Jiejie, the eunuchs from the Imperial Kitchens have prepared food and wine,

390
00:22:57,628 --> 00:22:59,732
and are asking everyone to come for dinner.

391
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:03,400
No need, I'm still on duty later.

392
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,841
I'm here to replace you. I'm worried that you will be too lonely.

393
00:23:05,841 --> 00:23:07,560
Go on.

394
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:09,338
I know that you are nice to me.

395
00:23:09,338 --> 00:23:12,046
But I really am fine.. You should go and have fun.

396
00:23:12,046 --> 00:23:14,825
All right then. It's cold outside, hurry and go back inside.

397
00:23:33,231 --> 00:23:34,671
At this moment,

398
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,318
what are you doing?

399
00:23:44,098 --> 00:23:46,240
What are you doing?

400
00:23:47,474 --> 00:23:51,328
The clouds in the sky form unique shapes; shooting stars send messages of longing.

401
00:23:51,328 --> 00:23:53,525
Silently, they cross the wide Milky Way.

402
00:23:53,525 --> 00:23:56,920
The delight of meeting that autumn night

403
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:59,563
surpasses all the joy on earth.

404
00:23:59,563 --> 00:24:03,603
Moments of tender love, the meeting is like a beautiful dream.

405
00:24:03,603 --> 00:24:06,564
Parting, the sight of the magpie bridge is unbearable.

406
00:24:06,564 --> 00:24:09,408
But if one's love is true and lasting,

407
00:24:09,408 --> 00:24:12,844
why is there a need to be together every day?

408
00:24:12,844 --> 00:24:17,349
But if one's love is true and lasting,

409
00:24:17,349 --> 00:24:23,200
why is there a need to be together every day?

410
00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:32,814
Why is it that you still haven't sent a letter to me?

411
00:24:34,021 --> 00:24:35,537
Could it be

412
00:24:35,537 --> 00:24:37,527
you've already forgotten about me?

413
00:24:40,964 --> 00:24:43,704
Although I'd long expected this day to come,

414
00:24:45,081 --> 00:24:48,092
why do I still feel so upset?

415
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:58,509
You are?

416
00:24:58,509 --> 00:25:00,817
I'm Xiao Shunzi. My respects to Miss Rouxi.

417
00:25:00,817 --> 00:25:02,303
Rise.

418
00:25:02,303 --> 00:25:05,600
I seldom come by Qianqing Palace (the Emperor's quarters), that's why I don't look familiar.

419
00:25:11,939 --> 00:25:14,680
Miss, keep this well. I'll take my leave.

420
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:24,760
You really didn't forget about me.

421
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,800
There's a fragrance too.

422
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:40,000
Mulan flower.

423
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,120
This is from Fourth Prince.

424
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,320
My respects to Miss.

425
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,800
Why are you so late today?

426
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,500
Eighth Prince especially asked me to do so.

427
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:56,900
Miss was on duty last night,

428
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:59,700
so Eighth Prince asked me to come later, as he was concerned that I'd disturb your rest.

429
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:03,000
Eighth Prince especially instructed me to hand this to you.

430
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:14,935
T/N: Poem in the letter is from a famous collection, [ 诗经 ].
Translation is in simplified meaning.

431
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:18,400
[ The night is coming, why aren't you going back? ]

432
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:22,080
[ If not because of me, you wouldn't be cold in the damp night. ]

433
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,060
[ The night is coming, why aren't you coming back? ]

434
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:28,120
[ If not because of me, you wouldn't be in a difficult position. ]

435
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:32,200
Can't go back.

436
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,960
Why?

437
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:49,600
Ruoxi, staring off into space again?

438
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:55,060
Ruoxi greets the Princes.

439
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:56,440
Rise.

440
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,420
What are you thinking about?

441
00:26:57,420 --> 00:27:00,760
Ruoxi, so nice. There's something I want to ask you.

442
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,380
Please ask, Ninth Prince.

443
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:04,080
Imperial Father privately summoned Second Brother to meet,

444
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,960
what did they talk about?

445
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:07,720
That day ...

446
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:10,160
Ruoxi, you should go back first.

447
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:12,840
Eighth Brother, what's wrong with asking?

448
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:16,840
Only she and Li Dequan know about this. If we don't ask her, who else can we ask?

449
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,720
People who directly serve the Emperor,

450
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:22,800
and who pass on information with regards to the private conversations the Emperor has with his subjects,

451
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:26,160
if they are caught, what happens to them? Have you thought of this?

452
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,480
Ruoxi, just go ahead and do whatever you have to do.

453
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,080
There's only the few of us here.

454
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,920
If she doesn't say anything and we don't say anything, who'd find out?

455
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:38,480
Your servant was standing outside the hall, while the Emperor and Second Prince were inside the hall,

456
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:41,640
your servant couldn't hear clearly, and I don't know what they talked about.

457
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:45,120
Eighth Brother, just look.

458
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,360
This is the person you waste your time and feelings on.

459
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,140
Even my dog...

460
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:49,040
Ninth Brother!

461
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:55,720
From now on, no one is to ask her about anything related to Imperial Father.

462
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,520
Eighth Prince!

463
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,560
Tenth Prince should go back with Ninth Prince first.

464
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:11,600
Why are you sending me away?

465
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,340
It's for your own good.

466
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:15,640
Take it as I'm begging you.

467
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:24,960
I don't want to hear it. You should go back first.

468
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,560
Even if I wanted to say anything, I wouldn't know what to say.

469
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:29,600
I really didn't hear anything.

470
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:32,000
That's good then.

471
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,240
You don't have to get involved in this mess then.

472
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:40,320
The Emperor still dotes on Second Prince.

473
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:44,480
No matter what decision you make, don't forget this.

474
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:49,400
I know what I'm doing. There's no need for you to worry too much.

475
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:53,320
Then your servant will take her leave now.

476
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,880
Jiejie, you've returned.

477
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:19,360
Why do you look so tired?

478
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,440
I'm fine.

479
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:25,320
Wine fermented rice balls.  Jiejie's favorite. Let's go!

480
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,680
It's sesame tangyuan.

481
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,600
That Xiao An Zi!

482
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,480
I told him to make wine fermented rice balls

483
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:39,040
and he gave me sesame tangyuan!

484
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:41,040
This won't do. I'm going to find him.

485
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,300
Forget it.

486
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:44,840
This won't do. He always does whatever he wants to,

487
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,480
he's sure to get into trouble in the future.

488
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:50,120
But even if you remind him, he'll still continue to do what he wants,

489
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:52,040
then won't your reminder be excessive?

490
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,160
But, I still need to do my best to remind him.

491
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:57,680
If he really does get into trouble, punished with kneeling or gets kicked out of the palace,

492
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:59,400
I couldn't bear it.

493
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,680
Jiejie, I'll go quickly and come back.

494
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:13,820
Yes, although history is still history,

495
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:17,480
if I don't do my best to prevent it, I will definitely regret it.

496
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:35,602
His Majesty still dotes on Second Prince. No matter what decision you make, don't forget this.

497
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:40,180
We can't ask Ruoxi and we can't ask Li Dequan!

498
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:42,200
In my opinion, let's just ask Imperial Father then!

499
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,147
Let's ask him who on earth he is going to appoint as Crown Prince!

500
00:30:44,147 --> 00:30:45,360
Ninth Brother!

501
00:30:48,666 --> 00:30:49,700
Eighth Brother,

502
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:51,499
we really can't afford to wait any longer.

503
00:30:51,499 --> 00:30:55,757
Right now, everyone in court is saying that Imperial Father will reinstate Second Brother as Crown Prince.

504
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,652
That's just rumors.

505
00:30:59,652 --> 00:31:00,840
Eighth Brother!

506
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,582
Where there's smoke, there must be fire.

507
00:31:03,582 --> 00:31:05,680
It seems, Imperial Father has this intention!

508
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,360
If Imperial Father really has this intention, we cannot stop him either.

509
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:15,360
Then we should just make Imperial Father give up this intention.

510
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:18,560
I know that currently, there's a lot of people who want Eighth Brother to be Crown Prince.

511
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:25,880
If they're willing to submit a petition and nominate Eighth Prince as Crown Prince. this will let Imperial Father know that you're the one everyone's hoping for.

512
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,040
- What you're doing is forcing Imperial Father.
- Isn't this just a reminder?

513
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:36,763
Right! This suggestion is great! This way, we don't have to directly suggest it, and Eighth Brother, you can be the Crown Prince.

514
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:41,324
Imperial Father dotes on Second Brother.

515
00:31:41,324 --> 00:31:45,340
Getting him to give up won't be easy.

516
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:48,680
Eighth Brother, since when did you become so wishy-washy?

517
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:56,520
Eighth Brother, this can't wait another moment. If we continue to drag, the position of Crown Prince will be gone.

518
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:59,880
Eighth Brother, can you bear to see Second Brother get reinstated again?

519
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:08,640
Ruoxi!

520
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:14,880
You're in such a fluster. Where are you going?

521
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:20,080
Greetings to Fourth Prince. Greetings to Thirteenth Prince.

522
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,060
Rise.

523
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:26,320
It's only been a few days we haven't met, how come you're acting so stand-offish now?

524
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,900
Since when? It's just that I still have a few errands to run.

525
00:32:29,798 --> 00:32:32,460
All right, then go do them.

526
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:34,820
Wait.

527
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:38,120
I've something to ask you.

528
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:41,800
Then I won't stay.

529
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:51,200
What did my Imperial Father say to my Second Brother that day?

530
00:32:53,880 --> 00:33:00,080
That day, your servant was standing outside the door, while His Majesty and Second Prince were in the Hall. Your servant doesn't know what they said.

531
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:04,920
Since you were just standing by the doorway, it could be then you didn't even hear a sound, couldn't it?

532
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,880
Is this what you said to your brother-in-law as well?

533
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,560
Yes.

534
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:25,220
Are you still angry at me about that night?

535
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:26,640
Your servant doesn't dare.

536
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,400
It's good as long as Fourth Prince isn't angry with this servant.

537
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:32,380
At that time, I may have misunderstood your intention.

538
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:34,400
It's good that Fourth Prince understands.

539
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,840
But I don't regret kissing you.

540
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:44,760
Why don't you wear it?

541
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:49,320
- What?
- The necklace.

542
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:50,900
I've left it in the room.

543
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:54,700
I will return it to you the next time you enter the palace.

544
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:57,400
Since you accepted it, there's no reason for you to return it.

545
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:02,960
For some things, although you may have been the one to start it, it's not up to you to end it.

546
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:06,020
One day, you will wear the necklace willingly.

547
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,800
Good sister, why are you in such a rush?

548
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:27,839
Where's Eighth Prince?

549
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:28,479
Eighth Prince?

550
00:34:28,479 --> 00:34:30,200
All of them returned back to their respective residences after court ended.

551
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:48,660
To Eighth Prince

552
00:34:53,439 --> 00:34:55,880
Is this fate?

553
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,460
Ruoxi Jiejie!

554
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:26,400
Congratulations to Jiejie.

555
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:30,580
Wangxi, don't be cheeky. What do you want from me again this time?

556
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:31,800
I don't dare.

557
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:34,280
I'm congratulating you sincerely.

558
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:37,800
It's not like there's any happy occasion for me, what are you congratulating me about?

559
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:41,200
Jiejie, you didn't know? Something big has happened in Qianqing Palace.

560
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,160
What happened?

561
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:46,820
30 court ministers sent a joint petition to nominate Eighth Prince as the Crown Prince.

562
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:49,760
His Majesty just summoned Eighth Prince and the whole group to see him.

563
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:58,120
Jiejie, if Eighth Prince becomes the Crown Prince, won't you enjoy a rise in status as well because of your sister's relationship to him?

564
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:07,260
Ah Lingah, Er Lundai,

565
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:10,400
Wu Xu, Wang Hongxu.

566
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:19,680
All of you men and almost a hundred ministers and the princes nominated Eighth Prince as a candidate for Crown Prince.

567
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:25,720
Imperial Father, I think that Second Prince is still the best choice for Crown Prince.

568
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:29,520
Imperial Father, I hold the same view as Fourth Brother.

569
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:38,980
Imperial Father, Eighth Prince is known to be virtuous and wise. Everyone knows clearly that he is the best person to be Crown Prince.

570
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:40,760
This is also the wish of the Ministers.

571
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:46,180
So everyone reckons that Eighth Prince should be the rightful Crown Prince, do they?

572
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:47,720
Whereas

573
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:52,040
Second Prince is not the ideal choice.

574
00:36:52,040 --> 00:37:00,450
Then I must have been blind and befuddled to have chosen Second Prince to become the Crown Prince!

575
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:08,646
Ninth Brother didn't mean that. Imperial Father, please appease your anger.

576
00:37:08,646 --> 00:37:13,960
If that's not his intention, then is this stack of petitions scrap paper?

577
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:18,480
Are you men here at Qianqing Palace to make merry and celebrate my birthday?

578
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,880
Are you all trying to revolt?

579
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:27,400
You men are trying to revolt!

580
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:30,140
Please be appeased, Imperial Father.

581
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:35,150
The princes and the ministers are worried that the Crown Prince position has been vacant for a long time and has caused uneasiness in the court.

582
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:39,760
That's why they suggested this. They mean well. Imperial Father, please don't blame them.

583
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:44,620
If they are worried about the country and its people, then what about you?

584
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:47,060
Do you desire to be the Crown Prince?

585
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:49,800
I'm willing to back out of the list of people nominated to be the new Crown Prince.

586
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:52,380
Imperial Father, please don't blame everyone anymore.

587
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:55,220
No wonder they Call you "The Virtuous Eighth Prince".

588
00:37:55,220 --> 00:38:03,300
At this moment, you stood out to save them. But in my opinion, you are a scheming Eighth Prince.

589
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:10,840
What I hate most is that you all got together in public and that there might be faction conflicts bringing trouble to the court.

590
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:15,700
But you colluded with First Prince and enticed him to help your plot to gain the Crown Prince position.

591
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:21,040
Now, you even incite the ministers to write petitions for you and force me to make you the Crown Prince.

592
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:23,240
- I had no such intention.
- Eighth Brother had no such intention.

593
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:25,460
All of you shut up.

594
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:30,920
Eighth Prince is guilty of scheming, desiring to go above his station, and forming cliques to disturb the peace in court. He is heinous in his crimes.

595
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:37,360
Upon my order, remove him of all his his titles, lock him up, and hand him over to Jurisdiction to deal with him.

596
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:42,200
Please be appeased, Imperial Father.

597
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:45,680
Eighth Prince did his best in court matters. He had no intention to plot against the Crown Prince,

598
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:47,420
much less revolt.

599
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:49,640
I beg of you to re-investigate the matter.

600
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:52,720
The facts are in front of you. You still want to defend him?

601
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:59,980
Imperial Father, Eighth Brother worked hard for the country in earnest, yet now he's been saddled with crimes. I want to put in a fair word for him.

602
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:02,300
Fourteenth Brother, don't talk anymore.

603
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:05,480
Eighth Brother was polite and respectful to everyone, but you accuse him of colluding with ministers.

604
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:08,840
Second Brother committed the mistake on his own, but now it became that Eighth Brother framed him.

605
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:11,200
All of these are baseless accusations.

606
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,260
Are you saying that I'm slandering him?

607
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:19,120
Imperial Father, you asked the ministers to nominate a candidate for Crown Prince. They followed your orders and nominated Eighth Prince.

608
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:21,140
Yet Imperial Father, you're punishing Eighth Brother instead.

609
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:23,640
I don't understand and I cannot accept this.

610
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:24,760
Fourteenth Prince!

611
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,860
Is this the attitude you should be using when you talk to me?

612
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:31,500
Since Imperial Father isn't dealing with things fairly, I must speak up.

613
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:35,640
I cannot stand by and watch my brother suffer injustice. On account of our brotherly love,

614
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:37,080
Imperial Father, please reconsider!

615
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:38,720
Brotherly love?

616
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,860
What kind of brotherly love is this?

617
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:42,760
I'm willing to use my head to vouch for him!

618
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:44,460
Use your head to vouch for him?

619
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:45,720
Use death to prove his innocence?

620
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,560
I shall grant you your wish then!

621
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:06,440
Imperial Father, appease your anger! Imperial Father, appease your anger!

622
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:09,120
Fourteenth Brother was just acting in the spur of a moment, he didn't mean to offend you.

623
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:11,880
He's just doing this out of brotherly love! Spare him, Imperial Father!

624
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:15,240
Imperial Father, we really didn't collude with each other in private!

625
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:21,060
How did I manage to raise all these unfilial sons?

626
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:23,360
I am unfilial. I'm willing to be punished by Imperial Father.

627
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,160
Fine.

628
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,200
Today, I'll let you brothers off.

629
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:29,680
Guards!

630
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:32,820
Take Fourteenth Prince down and give him twenty heavy strokes of the paddle!

631
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:39,320
Eighth Prince will be stripped of his title. There's no need to  lock him up. Hand him over to Jurisdiction to deal with him.

632
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:46,440
The other princes are to return home and reflect on your mistakes. If anyone tries to plead clemency for Eighth Prince again, that person will be executed immediately!

633
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:51,880
We receive your orders.

634
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:08,400
Jiejie, have a mouthful of water.

635
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:26,880
Yutan.

636
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:32,920
My heart seems to be poked by thousands of needles. It hurts so much.

637
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:41,600
Jiejie, are you all right?

638
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:43,900
I want to go back. I'm going to see how Eighth Prince is doing.

639
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:45,540
Jiejie! Jiejie!

640
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:48,460
You don't look too good. You need to take care of yourself first.

641
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:50,650
If you go back now, there's nothing you can do to help.

642
00:41:50,650 --> 00:41:53,040
If you anger His Majesty, it won't be a small matter!

643
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:59,200
My good sister, His Majesty's anger has yet to be appeased. If you make any mistakes, your head will roll.

644
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:05,460
Yes, Jiejie. I know that you are worried about Bei'le and Fujin. But even if you go back now, you won't be able to help the situation.

645
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:07,320
That's right. Yutan is right.

646
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:10,480
At this moment, you shouldn't create more trouble.

647
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:12,300
Jiejie, you must bear with it first.

648
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:14,680
It's not easy to leave this palace.

649
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:21,500
I understand.

650
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:29,380
Then, Jiejie, rest first. Yutan and I will return to Qianqing Palace. If there's any news, I will get Yutan to come back to let you know.

651
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:50,280
Although I knew the outcome of this history, I didn't know the twists and turns leading to it.

652
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:54,800
To think a simple ending would need you to experience so much pain.

653
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:57,560
What else will happen in the future?

654
00:42:57,560 --> 00:43:01,000
What other details are there that I do not know of?

655
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,360
What needs to happen before the Crown Prince can get reinstated?

656
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:06,400
How many other disasters must happen in between?

657
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:09,860
Jiejie!

658
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:15,280
How's the situation in Qianqing Palace now?

659
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:17,000
Currently, it still looks normal.

660
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,480
Jiejie, don't worry.

661
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:23,880
Jiejie has always done her best to serve His Majesty and you are also kind and nice to everyone. His Majesty has high regards for you.

662
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:27,080
He probably won't implicate you because of other matters.

663
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:32,340
Furthermore, they are all His Majesty's sons.

664
00:43:32,340 --> 00:43:34,760
It's inevitable that he punishes them in a fit of anger.

665
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:37,720
After a few days, once his temper cools down, everything will be fine again.

666
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:43,680
Yutan, thank you.

667
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:16,320
I'm safe, don't worry.

668
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:38,720
I now see that the high level of respect that I used to receive was intrinsically linked to my ties with Eighth Prince.

669
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:41,360
Ruoxi.

670
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:45,520
Eunuch Li.

671
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:47,280
You are back.

672
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:48,140
Yes.

673
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:52,720
Raise your spirits, and don't mess up your duties.

674
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:57,080
Ruoxi Jiejie.

675
00:44:57,080 --> 00:45:01,460
- My teacher has already instructed me.
- What did Eunuch Li say?

676
00:45:01,460 --> 00:45:05,360
What my teacher means is that you should continue to serve His Majesty as before,

677
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:08,600
if you are able to get through today safely, you won't have to worry about being implicated.

678
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:11,580
- Jiejie, do you understand?
- Yes.

679
00:45:11,580 --> 00:45:15,120
I just hope that the one who will be safe isn't just me.

680
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:20,400
My teacher says that you're one of the rare sensible people. He's sure that you can remain calm, be it in favor or in disgrace.

681
00:45:25,940 --> 00:45:28,760
Everything will be fine after today?

682
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:58,160
Your Majesty, I've something to say.

683
00:46:02,450 --> 00:46:08,603
I've already ordered that if anyone tried to speak up for Eighth Prince again,

684
00:46:09,796 --> 00:46:11,541
I will execute that person immediately.

685
00:46:14,858 --> 00:46:16,730
Do you still have anything to tell me now?

686
00:46:16,730 --> 00:46:20,956
Ruoxi, His Majesty has already shown you mercy. Dismissed.

687
00:46:24,232 --> 00:46:28,315
Even if I commit an enormous mistake, I still wish to speak my mind.

688
00:46:29,155 --> 00:46:29,926
This--

689
00:46:33,474 --> 00:46:34,656
Speak.

690
00:46:37,714 --> 00:46:41,854
While serving your Majesty, I saw how much you love your sons.

691
00:46:41,854 --> 00:46:46,846
Especially when Eighteenth Prince passed away, you were heartbroken,

692
00:46:46,846 --> 00:46:49,692
even to the point of falling ill.

693
00:46:49,692 --> 00:46:52,814
I see clearly your love for your sons.

694
00:46:57,219 --> 00:46:59,044
But Your Majesty,

695
00:46:59,044 --> 00:47:03,322
why can't you be more lenient to your sons who are still by your side, being filial to you?

696
00:47:03,322 --> 00:47:07,101
- Father and sons. Emperor and his courtiers--
- Enough.

697
00:47:12,063 --> 00:47:13,564
Your Majesty is a benevolent father.

698
00:47:13,564 --> 00:47:17,607
I'm sure you want to have your family by your side and enjoy familial love too.

699
00:47:17,607 --> 00:47:21,305
As they often say, if the father is benevolent, the sons will be filial.

700
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:32,670
♫  Stopping here, afraid to go any further ♫

701
00:47:33,380 --> 00:47:38,580
♫  So sorrow will be unable to make an appearance  ♫

702
00:47:40,670 --> 00:47:46,010
♫  On the next page, the farewell penned by you,  ♫

703
00:47:46,850 --> 00:47:52,200
♫  it was not up to me to refuse  ♫

704
00:47:53,430 --> 00:47:59,020
♫  We’ve walked down this path too hastily  ♫

705
00:47:59,660 --> 00:48:05,640
♫  Embracing desires that weren’t realistic  ♫

706
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:12,120
♫  Not in time, wasn’t able to wait long enough to look back and admire  ♫

707
00:48:12,580 --> 00:48:17,430
♫  The fragrance of magnolia is unable to hide wounds  ♫

708
00:48:18,260 --> 00:48:24,210
♫  No longer looking for the sunlight peeking through the clouds  ♫

709
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:30,560
♫  No longer looking for the paradise that we promised each other  ♫

710
00:48:31,180 --> 00:48:37,130
♫  No longer sighing, you once said that life is unpredictable  ♫

711
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:45,320
♫  The three inches of sunlight that I was unable to borrow  ♫

712
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:53,430
♫  No longer looking for the sunlight peeking through the clouds  ♫

713
00:48:53,440 --> 00:49:00,170
♫  No longer looking for the paradise that we promised each other  ♫

714
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:06,460
♫  No longer sighing, you once said that life is unpredictable  ♫

715
00:49:06,490 --> 00:49:12,740
♫  The three inches of sunlight that I was unable to borrow  ♫

716
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:21,220
♫  That paradise is the place where I’d loved you  ♫
