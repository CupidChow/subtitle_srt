00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:20,680
♫  In the blink of an eye, a thought of stubborn persistence  ♫

3
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:24,480
♫  We were destined to seek our doom like moths flying towards the flame  ♫

4
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:31,390
♫  Knowing that it’d be a disaster, why am I still at a loss about what to do  ♫

5
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:39,070
♫  The best is not to see, the best is not to miss you  ♫

6
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:44,370
♫  Only like this can I not be in love with you  ♫

7
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:48,850
♫  Just another brushing of the shoulder, and from then...♫

8
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:53,370
♫  I’ll keep falling deeper and deeper in love with you  ♫

9
00:00:55,700 --> 00:01:02,350
♫  It’s the mistake of time, ♫
♫ forcing us to pass each other by  ♫

10
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:05,450
♫  How I miss you, how far you are  ♫

11
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:12,450
♫  Even though I’d known it’d only result in pain,  ♫
♫ at this moment, I still don’t want to escape   ♫

12
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:15,960
♫  Pity these words are too glaring, they hurt the eyes  ♫

13
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,160
♫  Two worlds later ♫

14
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:25,270
♫  Don’t want to escape  ♫
♫  It’s the mistake of time,  ♫

15
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:30,360
♫  we can only pass each other by  ♫

16
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:35,190
♫  The magnitude of me missing you is as much as how far you are   ♫

17
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:41,930
♫  Even though I know the ending is a mistake that I cannot oppose  ♫

18
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:47,090
♫  Staying in this moment  ♫

19
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:55,090
♫  We can only accept that the feelings run deep, but fate is shallow  ♫

Scarlet Heart
Episode 31

21
00:02:04,354 --> 00:02:07,404
What is it that you're actually looking for me?

22
00:02:12,952 --> 00:02:15,228
About Yu Tan's death,

23
00:02:15,228 --> 00:02:17,551
do you feel any guilt at all?

24
00:02:23,147 --> 00:02:25,055
Since she saw me as her master,

25
00:02:25,055 --> 00:02:26,179
to sacrifice for her master,

26
00:02:26,179 --> 00:02:28,063
is to be expected.

27
00:02:28,063 --> 00:02:29,647
What guilt are you talking about?

28
00:02:33,083 --> 00:02:34,963
Since she died for me,

29
00:02:34,963 --> 00:02:37,029
I will naturally take care of her funeral

30
00:02:37,029 --> 00:02:38,283
and take care of her family for her

31
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:40,703
You do not have to worry about this.

32
00:02:41,883 --> 00:02:45,143
Everyone says that the 9th Prince is cruel and ruthless.

33
00:02:45,143 --> 00:02:46,483
In this matter

34
00:02:46,483 --> 00:02:48,572
you definitely live up to your reputation.

35
00:02:49,699 --> 00:02:51,610
Do you mean to say that Yu Tan is just

36
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:54,526
a chess piece you hid in the palace for 20 years?

37
00:02:54,526 --> 00:02:56,403
Now that she's failed,

38
00:02:56,403 --> 00:02:58,263
forgetting her is expected

39
00:02:58,263 --> 00:02:59,599
and not worth a single mention?

40
00:03:02,563 --> 00:03:04,523
Yu Tan was just a lowly servant.

41
00:03:04,523 --> 00:03:05,831
To have received my recognition

42
00:03:05,831 --> 00:03:07,123
and to have been my tool,

43
00:03:07,123 --> 00:03:08,823
is her blessing for generations to come.

44
00:03:13,654 --> 00:03:14,994
If you want to say something

45
00:03:14,994 --> 00:03:16,339
about your sworn sister,

46
00:03:17,783 --> 00:03:19,524
You should go search for your Emperor.

47
00:03:20,143 --> 00:03:22,243
He's the real murderer.

48
00:04:28,563 --> 00:04:33,208
4th Brother, you owe me so much!

49
00:04:36,883 --> 00:04:37,943
8th Brother.

50
00:04:39,323 --> 00:04:42,623
9th Brother, sit down.

51
00:04:49,748 --> 00:04:50,743
8th Brother,

52
00:04:51,263 --> 00:04:52,803
4th was being ridiculous today,

53
00:04:52,803 --> 00:04:54,267
scolding us in front of everyone.

54
00:04:54,267 --> 00:04:56,543
It was 10th who was delaying the Zhang family because they didn't want to come to the capital,

55
00:04:56,543 --> 00:04:57,983
but he put all the blame on you, all the same.

56
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:59,391
What are you going to do about this?

57
00:05:00,263 --> 00:05:03,833
Tell 10th Brother to hurry up

58
00:05:03,833 --> 00:05:06,143
and stop making trouble with that General,

59
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:08,338
in case the Emperor

60
00:05:08,338 --> 00:05:10,523
uses it to find fault in the future.

61
00:05:10,523 --> 00:05:11,853
8th Brother!

62
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:13,163
We cannot keep on retreating!

63
00:05:13,163 --> 00:05:14,741
He will only go overboard!

64
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:18,763
The one who led us brothers

65
00:05:18,763 --> 00:05:20,463
to fight for the throne was you!

66
00:05:20,463 --> 00:05:22,520
The one who is suffering now is also you!

67
00:05:22,583 --> 00:05:24,183
Can't we fight properly one more time?

68
00:05:24,183 --> 00:05:26,026
That's better than being forced into a corner by him!

69
00:05:29,403 --> 00:05:31,203
The dust has already settled.

70
00:05:33,343 --> 00:05:35,803
He is the Emperor.

71
00:05:40,763 --> 00:05:42,443
What he wants me to do,

72
00:05:42,443 --> 00:05:44,083
I will do.

73
00:05:45,843 --> 00:05:50,303
Whatever he wants, it's up to him. Even if it's confinement.

74
00:05:51,263 --> 00:05:52,643
With things as they are,

75
00:05:52,903 --> 00:05:55,503
why bother doing more,

76
00:05:55,503 --> 00:05:58,783
only to let him find more to blame us for?

77
00:06:00,423 --> 00:06:04,383
9th Brother, you need to keep your temper in check.

78
00:06:04,383 --> 00:06:05,809
Going against him

79
00:06:05,809 --> 00:06:07,543
will only bring harm to those around you.

80
00:06:07,543 --> 00:06:09,183
There is nothing to be gained from that.

81
00:06:11,983 --> 00:06:14,811
Master, there is news from the Palace,

82
00:06:14,811 --> 00:06:17,103
the Emperor wants you to come there immediately.

83
00:06:19,403 --> 00:06:20,603
I know now.

84
00:06:22,543 --> 00:06:25,463
9th Brother, what we talked about today,

85
00:06:25,463 --> 00:06:27,463
think about it clearly.

86
00:06:41,023 --> 00:06:43,403
Sister-in-law.

87
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:46,663
I would like to listen to your thoughts.

88
00:06:48,743 --> 00:06:51,003
Just as Bei'le said,

89
00:06:51,003 --> 00:06:54,263
why do something only to give the Emperor something to catch you with?

90
00:06:54,263 --> 00:06:55,903
What Bei'le is doing

91
00:06:55,903 --> 00:06:57,423
is for the good of everyone.

92
00:06:57,423 --> 00:06:58,223
No.

93
00:06:58,983 --> 00:07:01,763
If we're going to be brought down,

94
00:07:01,763 --> 00:07:04,783
he is going to suffer right along with us.

95
00:07:06,103 --> 00:07:08,723
We all need to stay hidden from him,

96
00:07:08,723 --> 00:07:10,823
how are we going to do that?

97
00:07:12,023 --> 00:07:13,723
Forget this.

98
00:07:13,723 --> 00:07:15,823
Oh, I have something interesting,

99
00:07:15,823 --> 00:07:17,783
It's related to Ruoxi.

100
00:07:17,783 --> 00:07:20,643
Don't know if sister-in-law is interested in hearing it.

101
00:07:39,103 --> 00:07:44,143
Second Miss... Second Miss.

102
00:07:45,103 --> 00:07:47,763
Qiaohui.

103
00:07:47,763 --> 00:07:49,763
I am Qiaohui.

104
00:07:49,763 --> 00:07:52,403
Leave, this isn't a place that you can be.

105
00:07:52,403 --> 00:07:53,383
Second Miss.

106
00:07:53,383 --> 00:07:55,603
It is the Emperor who ordered me to wait on you.

107
00:07:55,603 --> 00:07:57,383
I know it was him!

108
00:07:57,383 --> 00:07:59,423
That's why I want you to leave!

109
00:07:59,423 --> 00:08:01,063
Second Miss,

110
00:08:01,923 --> 00:08:03,643
your servant heard Eunuch Gao say that

111
00:08:03,643 --> 00:08:04,783
you're with child.

112
00:08:07,923 --> 00:08:11,443
How can you not take care of yourself?

113
00:08:12,223 --> 00:08:18,423
If you have anything on your mind, let me know.

114
00:08:18,423 --> 00:08:21,023
I've waited on your sister since she was young,

115
00:08:21,023 --> 00:08:24,303
so I've also watched you grow up.

116
00:08:25,503 --> 00:08:28,443
I should not say this,

117
00:08:28,443 --> 00:08:31,043
but in my heart,

118
00:08:31,043 --> 00:08:34,343
I've always thought of Madam as my elder sister

119
00:08:35,103 --> 00:08:36,363
and Second Miss

120
00:08:36,363 --> 00:08:38,943
as my biological younger sister.

121
00:08:49,603 --> 00:08:54,063
Second Miss, whatever happens,

122
00:08:54,063 --> 00:08:57,323
the baby must come first.

123
00:08:57,323 --> 00:08:59,763
If Madam knows that you are in this state,

124
00:08:59,763 --> 00:09:01,903
she will be very sad.

125
00:09:05,623 --> 00:09:07,923
Didn't you promise Madam,

126
00:09:07,923 --> 00:09:09,983
that you will take care of yourself?

127
00:09:12,023 --> 00:09:13,303
Aunt!

128
00:09:17,483 --> 00:09:18,923
Aunt!

129
00:09:19,343 --> 00:09:21,923
Shall I tell you a joke?

130
00:09:21,923 --> 00:09:23,463
Tell me on another day.

131
00:09:23,463 --> 00:09:26,103
Let me sing you a song then.

132
00:09:26,103 --> 00:09:27,783
Another day for that too.

133
00:09:27,783 --> 00:09:29,583
I'm in no mood to listen to anything today.

134
00:09:29,583 --> 00:09:33,023
Aunt, I've been practising my zither.

135
00:09:33,023 --> 00:09:35,063
When you can play your zither properly,

136
00:09:35,063 --> 00:09:37,503
you father will be very happy.

137
00:09:37,503 --> 00:09:40,103
How about it? My aunt is very pretty, isn't she?

138
00:09:40,103 --> 00:09:43,023
Count your blessings that you've seen her today.

139
00:09:43,023 --> 00:09:44,423
Greetings, Elder Aunt.

140
00:09:45,723 --> 00:09:47,423
Rise.

141
00:09:48,503 --> 00:09:49,783
Is she new?

142
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:51,803
She was moved here not too long ago.

143
00:09:51,803 --> 00:09:53,563
Since Aunt has been sick these last few days,

144
00:09:53,563 --> 00:09:55,243
you haven't seen her.

145
00:09:56,303 --> 00:09:58,503
Your Aunt will soon get better.

146
00:10:46,623 --> 00:10:49,303
- Greetings, Emperor.
- Greetings, Imperial Uncle, Father

147
00:10:50,243 --> 00:10:51,507
Get up.

148
00:10:51,507 --> 00:10:53,223
Thank you, Imperial Uncle

149
00:10:57,783 --> 00:10:58,903
Cheng Huan,

150
00:10:58,903 --> 00:11:00,583
who asked you to play this song?

151
00:11:00,583 --> 00:11:02,243
I chose it myself.

152
00:11:02,243 --> 00:11:03,283
This song is nice,

153
00:11:03,283 --> 00:11:05,903
did I play it badly?

154
00:11:05,903 --> 00:11:08,543
No, it's very good.

155
00:11:08,543 --> 00:11:11,503
Are you speaking the truth, Aunt?

156
00:11:11,503 --> 00:11:13,143
Your aunt dotes on you.

157
00:11:13,143 --> 00:11:14,183
However you play,

158
00:11:14,183 --> 00:11:15,663
when it comes to her,

159
00:11:15,663 --> 00:11:17,343
she will still praise you.

160
00:11:19,863 --> 00:11:22,683
Imperial  Uncle, did you like it?

161
00:11:22,683 --> 00:11:24,343
Yes, I did.

162
00:11:24,343 --> 00:11:25,663
I heard my brothers say that

163
00:11:25,663 --> 00:11:28,743
you love pastoral music.

164
00:11:28,743 --> 00:11:30,263
This song seems to be

165
00:11:30,263 --> 00:11:32,823
what it's about.

166
00:11:38,483 --> 00:11:41,323
Cheng Huan, you made your aunt laugh,

167
00:11:41,323 --> 00:11:44,143
so I will reward you properly.

168
00:11:45,543 --> 00:11:46,703
Who knows,

169
00:11:46,703 --> 00:11:48,063
if in the future

170
00:11:48,063 --> 00:11:49,763
you and Brother will pamper Cheng Huan

171
00:11:49,763 --> 00:11:52,623
or your own child more.

172
00:11:53,703 --> 00:11:57,423
They're both sisters. I will pamper both.

173
00:11:57,423 --> 00:11:59,223
Why are they sisters?

174
00:12:00,023 --> 00:12:02,943
I would very much prefer a prince.

175
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:04,983
He will accomplish great things in the future

176
00:12:04,983 --> 00:12:07,383
and be my successor.

177
00:12:08,363 --> 00:12:11,403
I just want a good girl.

178
00:12:11,403 --> 00:12:13,563
The throne too much of a temptation.

179
00:12:13,563 --> 00:12:15,283
I don't want my own children

180
00:12:15,283 --> 00:12:18,943
to be fighting among themselves, without any regard for each other.

181
00:12:21,403 --> 00:12:23,123
Brother.

182
00:12:23,123 --> 00:12:24,783
I still have matters to handle,

183
00:12:24,783 --> 00:12:26,103
I will take my leave.

184
00:12:29,783 --> 00:12:32,903
Your health is not good, rest more.

185
00:12:32,903 --> 00:12:34,943
Thank you, for your concern.

186
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:36,483
Cheng Huan, let's go.

187
00:12:36,483 --> 00:12:37,683
I'll bring you home.

188
00:12:37,683 --> 00:12:39,283
Yes.

189
00:12:45,783 --> 00:12:48,203
I will also take my leave.

190
00:12:52,103 --> 00:12:53,523
It's been more than 10 days!

191
00:12:53,523 --> 00:12:55,383
Shouldn't your anger be over?

192
00:12:55,863 --> 00:12:57,663
Even if you don't want to see me,

193
00:12:57,663 --> 00:12:59,583
the child wants to see its father!

194
00:13:02,683 --> 00:13:05,163
You're with child now.

195
00:13:05,163 --> 00:13:06,863
I'll need to title you.

196
00:13:08,663 --> 00:13:10,323
Let's discuss this.

197
00:13:10,323 --> 00:13:12,423
What title do you want?

198
00:13:14,503 --> 00:13:16,663
I don't want any title.

199
00:13:18,423 --> 00:13:20,723
You're pregnant

200
00:13:20,723 --> 00:13:22,103
but many still do not know.

201
00:13:23,603 --> 00:13:25,423
But in a month,

202
00:13:25,423 --> 00:13:28,023
your stomach will start to show.

203
00:13:30,103 --> 00:13:32,183
Even if you don't want to be my wife,

204
00:13:33,743 --> 00:13:36,423
the child cannot do without a father.

205
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:41,183
Do you wish for the child to be looked down upon?

206
00:13:41,183 --> 00:13:43,343
Let me leave the palace.

207
00:13:44,183 --> 00:13:45,423
Once I'm outside,

208
00:13:46,343 --> 00:13:49,223
there will be no one to mock him.

209
00:13:50,983 --> 00:13:53,283
I will never let you and the child leave me.

210
00:13:53,783 --> 00:13:55,743
Don't even think of it!

211
00:13:58,983 --> 00:14:02,323
Do you only have hate for me now?

212
00:14:11,063 --> 00:14:12,823
How I wish

213
00:14:13,903 --> 00:14:16,223
I had only hate for you.

214
00:14:18,503 --> 00:14:21,223
But even if I want to,

215
00:14:22,183 --> 00:14:24,303
I can't bring myself to hate you.

216
00:14:29,663 --> 00:14:31,903
I'm only afraid of the Palace,

217
00:14:33,863 --> 00:14:35,703
afraid of the Emperor.

218
00:14:37,103 --> 00:14:39,583
Why is he so cruel?

219
00:14:41,143 --> 00:14:43,423
So much so that I'm petrified.

220
00:14:45,023 --> 00:14:46,863
Don't be sad anymore.

221
00:14:48,863 --> 00:14:51,223
It's not good for the baby.

222
00:14:53,503 --> 00:14:54,903
Ruoxi,

223
00:14:57,703 --> 00:15:00,743
I will always be your 4th Prince,

224
00:15:03,663 --> 00:15:07,223
however, I am also the Emperor.

225
00:15:09,503 --> 00:15:12,423
There are a lot of things that I can't help doing.

226
00:15:17,103 --> 00:15:22,183
There may be a lot of things that can't be helped,

227
00:15:22,903 --> 00:15:24,983
but maybe when handled by someone else,

228
00:15:24,983 --> 00:15:28,923
there will be a different way of doing them.

229
00:15:28,923 --> 00:15:30,223
Yet you have always chosen

230
00:15:30,223 --> 00:15:32,583
the most extreme methods,

231
00:15:33,143 --> 00:15:36,123
and you just end up hurting the people around you.

232
00:15:37,423 --> 00:15:39,223
Why?

233
00:15:40,943 --> 00:15:43,623
Why must you be so cruel to that extreme?

234
00:16:24,623 --> 00:16:27,183
What are all these bits and pieces of cloth for?

235
00:16:27,183 --> 00:16:29,223
They are used to make a 'bai jia yi'.
(Chinese patchwork robe - each patch, a blessing)

236
00:16:29,223 --> 00:16:31,423
What is a 'bai jia yi'?

237
00:16:31,423 --> 00:16:32,983
Once a Baijiayi is put on,
(Usually a gift for an infant)

238
00:16:32,983 --> 00:16:34,503
one will live until seventy-seven.
(Qing had a high infant mortality rate)

239
00:16:34,503 --> 00:16:36,383
It's very good for children.

240
00:16:36,383 --> 00:16:38,623
Is this being made for little brother?

241
00:16:38,623 --> 00:16:41,023
It could be a little sister too!

242
00:16:41,863 --> 00:16:43,763
Cheng Huan.

243
00:16:43,763 --> 00:16:46,823
Come here, I have something to ask you.

244
00:16:55,203 --> 00:16:56,703
The song you played the other day,

245
00:16:56,703 --> 00:16:58,063
who chose it for you?

246
00:16:58,063 --> 00:17:00,123
You've finally asked me that, Aunt.

247
00:17:00,123 --> 00:17:01,983
You knew that I'd ask you!

248
00:17:01,983 --> 00:17:03,983
It's the servant who is waiting on me.

249
00:17:03,983 --> 00:17:06,063
Rui'er chose it for me.

250
00:17:06,063 --> 00:17:07,983
She said, only if Aunt asked,

251
00:17:07,983 --> 00:17:09,603
could I say anything.

252
00:17:09,603 --> 00:17:11,283
Other than you,

253
00:17:11,283 --> 00:17:12,823
no one else can know anything about it,

254
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:15,242
otherwise, she will definitely die.

255
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:16,523
What else did she say?

256
00:17:16,523 --> 00:17:20,063
She said that if you asked, I have to say

257
00:17:20,063 --> 00:17:22,023
as long as you're willing to give up

258
00:17:22,023 --> 00:17:24,422
Er Qi (Two Seven), she will follow accordingly.

259
00:17:24,942 --> 00:17:26,463
Er Qi?

260
00:17:27,363 --> 00:17:29,063
14th!

261
00:17:31,783 --> 00:17:33,623
No wonder the Emperor

262
00:17:33,623 --> 00:17:35,023
is so strict

263
00:17:35,023 --> 00:17:36,383
with the servants.

264
00:17:36,383 --> 00:17:38,823
Aunt, what are you talking about?

265
00:17:40,383 --> 00:17:44,043
Remember, Rui'er helping you to choose that song,

266
00:17:44,043 --> 00:17:45,383
teaching you what to say to me,

267
00:17:45,383 --> 00:17:46,863
all these things never happened.

268
00:17:46,863 --> 00:17:49,383
Never.

269
00:17:49,383 --> 00:17:52,183
Look for an excuse to have Rui'er sent away.

270
00:17:52,183 --> 00:17:53,423
Send her to do other things.

271
00:17:53,423 --> 00:17:55,163
Whether it is in the laundry or sweeping the floor, whatever works.

272
00:17:55,163 --> 00:17:57,843
Why? I like her very much.

273
00:17:57,843 --> 00:18:01,423
It's because you like her, that's why you need to do this.

274
00:18:02,303 --> 00:18:04,603
As long as one is of no value,

275
00:18:04,603 --> 00:18:07,463
she can stay in the Palace peacefully until it's time for her to leave.

276
00:18:11,863 --> 00:18:13,343
Second Miss,

277
00:18:14,023 --> 00:18:15,783
Eunuch Gao is here.

278
00:18:16,383 --> 00:18:17,703
Come in.

279
00:18:20,943 --> 00:18:22,783
Go and play now.

280
00:18:24,623 --> 00:18:25,603
Elder Aunt,

281
00:18:25,603 --> 00:18:28,623
the Emperor had me bring this over.

282
00:18:38,223 --> 00:18:40,823
I will take my leave.

283
00:18:49,723 --> 00:18:51,343
What's there to see?

284
00:18:51,903 --> 00:18:54,223
It's still better to take a look.

285
00:19:07,103 --> 00:19:08,903
What's written on it?

286
00:19:08,903 --> 00:19:10,663
The Emperor has chosen some titles,

287
00:19:10,663 --> 00:19:12,663
asking me to pick one.

288
00:19:22,383 --> 00:19:24,023
Qiao Hui knows

289
00:19:24,023 --> 00:19:26,543
Second Miss is angry at the Emperor,

290
00:19:26,543 --> 00:19:29,303
but you still need to think about the baby!

291
00:19:29,303 --> 00:19:30,943
You need to think of your father,

292
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:32,423
and your dead mother,

293
00:19:33,023 --> 00:19:35,043
and Madam.

294
00:19:35,043 --> 00:19:37,263
If Madam knew what's happened

295
00:19:37,263 --> 00:19:38,823
and that Second Miss is pregnant

296
00:19:38,823 --> 00:19:40,223
but doesn't even have a title,

297
00:19:40,223 --> 00:19:42,743
she would be so sad for Second Miss.

298
00:19:42,743 --> 00:19:43,923
I know Second Miss

299
00:19:43,923 --> 00:19:45,423
has the Emperor in her heart.

300
00:19:45,423 --> 00:19:48,703
So why can't you be the Emperor's Imperial concubine?

301
00:19:49,543 --> 00:19:52,943
Qiao'hui, with a title

302
00:19:52,943 --> 00:19:55,623
I will have to be connected with this Forbidden City forever.

303
00:20:01,023 --> 00:20:02,903
Second Miss,

304
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:06,103
8th Fu'jin wants to see you.
(8th Prince's main wife)

305
00:20:06,103 --> 00:20:08,103
She's already arrived.

306
00:20:10,903 --> 00:20:13,663
Did she say what it's about?

307
00:20:13,663 --> 00:20:14,823
She didn't say.

308
00:20:14,823 --> 00:20:16,223
If Second Miss doesn't want to see her,

309
00:20:16,223 --> 00:20:17,743
I will respond back to her.

310
00:20:18,923 --> 00:20:20,843
No.

311
00:20:20,843 --> 00:20:22,243
For Jie'jie's matter,

312
00:20:22,243 --> 00:20:24,703
I owe her a huge favor.

313
00:20:25,703 --> 00:20:27,843
If the Emperor speaks of it,

314
00:20:27,843 --> 00:20:31,263
just say it was I that wanted to see her.

315
00:20:32,063 --> 00:20:34,423
I understand.

316
00:20:51,223 --> 00:20:52,703
Greetings 8th Fu'jin.

317
00:20:52,703 --> 00:20:54,223
8th Fu'jin please accept my greetings

318
00:20:54,583 --> 00:20:57,643
Even though it hasn't been officially acknowleged,

319
00:20:57,643 --> 00:21:00,143
you are still the Emperor's woman.

320
00:21:00,143 --> 00:21:02,183
I do not deserve such a formal greeting.

321
00:21:02,183 --> 00:21:06,643
Fu'jin! The Emperor is going to award Second Miss very soon!

322
00:21:06,643 --> 00:21:08,163
Qiaohui.

323
00:21:08,163 --> 00:21:10,303
I have some things to say to Fujin.

324
00:21:10,303 --> 00:21:12,183
Keep a look out for me.

325
00:21:12,183 --> 00:21:15,263
Yes, I take my leave.

326
00:21:22,143 --> 00:21:25,263
What have you come to look for me for?

327
00:21:26,023 --> 00:21:27,503
A few days ago,

328
00:21:27,503 --> 00:21:30,023
the Emperor reprimanded Wang'ye

329
00:21:30,023 --> 00:21:31,843
putting on him, the blame for what 10th Prince did

330
00:21:31,843 --> 00:21:33,903
to Wang'ye.

331
00:21:33,903 --> 00:21:36,703
What happened was, that General purposely made things difficult

332
00:21:36,703 --> 00:21:39,243
so 10th Prince would go against him.

333
00:21:39,243 --> 00:21:40,763
But the Emperor

334
00:21:40,763 --> 00:21:41,783
put the blame

335
00:21:41,783 --> 00:21:43,743
all on Wang'ye.

336
00:21:46,743 --> 00:21:48,323
Now, Wang'ye

337
00:21:48,323 --> 00:21:51,143
no longer bothers to care about these issues.

338
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:52,863
Whether things go fair or foul,

339
00:21:52,863 --> 00:21:55,723
he doesn't dwell on them.

340
00:21:55,723 --> 00:21:58,423
Whatever the Emperor commands, he will do.

341
00:21:58,423 --> 00:22:02,103
Being confined or not, is also up to him.

342
00:22:02,103 --> 00:22:03,583
He even tried persuading 9th Prince

343
00:22:03,583 --> 00:22:06,303
not to go against the Emperor anymore.

344
00:22:06,303 --> 00:22:08,103
With things as they are,

345
00:22:08,103 --> 00:22:10,903
what else is there to fight for?

346
00:22:12,143 --> 00:22:14,283
The Emperor has been testing

347
00:22:14,283 --> 00:22:15,623
and discouraging us.

348
00:22:16,143 --> 00:22:18,703
We have always given way to him,

349
00:22:18,703 --> 00:22:21,023
but he has always taken advantage of that.

350
00:22:21,023 --> 00:22:23,343
Whatever reports he's completed,

351
00:22:23,343 --> 00:22:25,143
the Emperor always looks through them himself.

352
00:22:25,143 --> 00:22:26,183
The Court subjects also side with the Emperor,

353
00:22:26,183 --> 00:22:29,343
always watching out for any fault.

354
00:22:29,343 --> 00:22:31,003
Wang'ye has worked hard for half his life,

355
00:22:31,003 --> 00:22:33,023
doing almost everything.

356
00:22:33,023 --> 00:22:33,783
But it's as if

357
00:22:33,783 --> 00:22:37,063
he has never done anything for the Qing dynasty!

358
00:22:37,983 --> 00:22:40,703
If Wang'ye was still that attached,

359
00:22:41,423 --> 00:22:44,543
I would have gone crazy by now.

360
00:22:44,543 --> 00:22:46,703
I have never thought of

361
00:22:46,703 --> 00:22:48,903
not caring about your concerns anymore.

362
00:22:50,103 --> 00:22:53,383
I just hoped for you to live well.

363
00:22:54,383 --> 00:22:56,083
You have no idea

364
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:59,223
how difficult it is to live with a sword above our heads.

365
00:23:00,183 --> 00:23:03,423
Who knows how much longer we'll be able to live for.

366
00:23:05,083 --> 00:23:06,943
We all know that sword

367
00:23:06,943 --> 00:23:08,883
will come down one day.

368
00:23:08,883 --> 00:23:10,823
But we still have to worry

369
00:23:10,823 --> 00:23:12,983
when that will be!

370
00:23:13,583 --> 00:23:18,083
I was still terrified of that in the past. But now,

371
00:23:18,083 --> 00:23:20,903
I feel that the sooner it is,

372
00:23:20,903 --> 00:23:24,343
the better it will be.

373
00:23:27,383 --> 00:23:29,703
Why did you come

374
00:23:30,383 --> 00:23:32,823
to see me today?

375
00:23:32,823 --> 00:23:34,343
9th Prince told me something

376
00:23:34,863 --> 00:23:37,583
interesting.

377
00:23:38,463 --> 00:23:41,783
The Emperor hating us so much now,

378
00:23:41,783 --> 00:23:42,663
besides having

379
00:23:42,663 --> 00:23:44,743
fought for the throne for so many years,

380
00:23:44,743 --> 00:23:47,423
is also for another very important reason.

381
00:23:47,423 --> 00:23:48,903
It is also linked to the time

382
00:23:48,903 --> 00:23:50,543
back when Wangye tried to set him up and failed,

383
00:23:50,543 --> 00:23:52,863
which caused 13th Prince to be confined instead.

384
00:23:53,623 --> 00:23:56,463
This has forced him to be on his toes all the time now.

385
00:23:58,663 --> 00:24:00,703
But you're a clever one,

386
00:24:00,703 --> 00:24:02,483
have you ever thought of

387
00:24:02,483 --> 00:24:03,463
why Wang'ye wanted to go against

388
00:24:03,463 --> 00:24:05,143
the Emperor back then, when they were

389
00:24:05,143 --> 00:24:06,843
still on friendly terms?

390
00:24:06,843 --> 00:24:09,163
If it was only for the throne,

391
00:24:09,163 --> 00:24:10,183
why did he not do the same

392
00:24:10,183 --> 00:24:11,703
to 3rd Prince,

393
00:24:11,703 --> 00:24:13,383
who was also eyeing the throne?

394
00:24:15,463 --> 00:24:17,303
Could it be that she thinks

395
00:24:17,303 --> 00:24:18,623
8th was going against the Emperor

396
00:24:18,623 --> 00:24:20,223
because of our relationship?

397
00:24:21,103 --> 00:24:23,383
That definitely couldn't have happened

398
00:24:23,383 --> 00:24:25,463
in a span of 2 to 3 years.

399
00:24:26,343 --> 00:24:27,743
Reflecting back on that time,

400
00:24:27,743 --> 00:24:30,583
I wasn't involved with the Emperor yet.

401
00:24:33,963 --> 00:24:35,263
Why?

402
00:24:36,623 --> 00:24:39,783
The funny thing about this whole issue is this.

403
00:24:40,943 --> 00:24:43,063
I heard from 9th Prince,

404
00:24:43,063 --> 00:24:45,343
that back then someone, not just once,

405
00:24:45,343 --> 00:24:47,203
especially warned Wang'ye

406
00:24:47,203 --> 00:24:49,623
to be careful of the Emperor

407
00:24:49,623 --> 00:24:52,743
and even voiced a whole list of names.

408
00:24:52,743 --> 00:24:55,443
Although Wang'ye was dubious,

409
00:24:55,443 --> 00:24:57,503
to be on the safe side,

410
00:24:57,503 --> 00:25:00,863
he decided to do something about it.

411
00:25:00,863 --> 00:25:02,503
If that was the case,

412
00:25:03,143 --> 00:25:07,263
the Emperor seems to be hating the wrong person.

413
00:25:07,263 --> 00:25:09,703
The bitterness that 13th brother had to suffer for 10 years

414
00:25:09,703 --> 00:25:12,023
cannot entirely be blamed on His Majesty

415
00:25:13,023 --> 00:25:18,783
The mastermind was someone else.

416
00:25:23,583 --> 00:25:26,223
Someone else.

417
00:25:29,223 --> 00:25:31,143
Someone else.

418
00:25:31,143 --> 00:25:32,603
Wager a guess,

419
00:25:32,603 --> 00:25:35,343
that if His Majesty learns of this

420
00:25:36,103 --> 00:25:38,503
which will be stronger, his sadness

421
00:25:38,503 --> 00:25:41,103
or his anger?

422
00:25:41,783 --> 00:25:45,063
I really do want to see His Majesty's reaction.

423
00:25:48,883 --> 00:25:51,283
You came here from Bei'le's manor

424
00:25:51,283 --> 00:25:53,863
after having received so much from Wang'ye over the years.

425
00:25:53,863 --> 00:25:54,903
The Emperor now wants you

426
00:25:54,903 --> 00:25:56,223
to cut off all ties with us!

427
00:25:56,223 --> 00:25:58,223
How can it be that easy?

428
00:25:58,223 --> 00:25:59,383
That's right,

429
00:25:59,383 --> 00:26:02,263
9th Brother-in-law wants me to tell you

430
00:26:02,263 --> 00:26:05,003
that if we have to suffer pain,

431
00:26:05,003 --> 00:26:08,783
we'll give you at least half of it!

432
00:26:28,383 --> 00:26:32,023
Second Miss, what's wrong?

433
00:26:34,343 --> 00:26:36,263
I'll order someone to call the Imperial Physician

434
00:26:36,263 --> 00:26:37,503
Qiaohui.

435
00:26:38,343 --> 00:26:39,963
Qiaohui.

436
00:26:40,663 --> 00:26:44,963
It was me. It turns out that everything happened because of me.

437
00:26:44,963 --> 00:26:46,823
I was the mastermind.

438
00:26:46,823 --> 00:26:49,243
Second Miss, what are you talking about?

439
00:26:49,243 --> 00:26:51,963
I've always worried about 8th Prince's ending,

440
00:26:53,063 --> 00:26:55,063
but I never thought that

441
00:26:55,063 --> 00:26:57,783
his ending is caused by me.

442
00:26:59,463 --> 00:27:01,223
If not for me,

443
00:27:01,863 --> 00:27:04,843
he wouldn't have gone against 4th Prince

444
00:27:04,843 --> 00:27:06,323
and maybe 13th Prince,

445
00:27:06,323 --> 00:27:08,903
wouldn't have been confined.

446
00:27:08,903 --> 00:27:10,123
And Lu Wu...

447
00:27:10,123 --> 00:27:12,943
wouldn't have been with 13th Prince

448
00:27:12,943 --> 00:27:15,483
becoming the one stuck in the middle

449
00:27:15,483 --> 00:27:17,103
and committing suicide.

450
00:27:17,103 --> 00:27:19,723
How can you say such words?

451
00:27:19,723 --> 00:27:22,663
If the Emperor becomes aware of this, it will be terrible!

452
00:27:22,663 --> 00:27:27,663
It's me. Everything is because of me.

453
00:27:27,663 --> 00:27:29,843
All these years,

454
00:27:29,843 --> 00:27:31,863
what exactly have I done?!

455
00:27:31,863 --> 00:27:33,303
Second Miss!

456
00:27:33,303 --> 00:27:35,823
Second Miss, please don't scare me.

457
00:27:35,823 --> 00:27:37,963
What exactly did 8th Fu'jin say to you?

458
00:27:37,963 --> 00:27:39,883
Second Miss.

459
00:27:48,883 --> 00:27:51,083
Qiao Hui,

460
00:27:51,083 --> 00:27:54,743
the physician can't cure my illness.

461
00:27:55,503 --> 00:27:58,663
Leave me be.

462
00:28:03,423 --> 00:28:04,383
Lady.

463
00:28:04,383 --> 00:28:07,103
What do you want to have for dinner?

464
00:28:07,943 --> 00:28:08,943
Go out now.

465
00:28:17,623 --> 00:28:21,283
Second Miss, I beg of you!

466
00:28:21,283 --> 00:28:23,703
Madam was the same way back then.

467
00:28:23,703 --> 00:28:27,383
She didn't eat, didn't move, didn't say anything.

468
00:28:27,383 --> 00:28:29,123
I beg of you,

469
00:28:29,123 --> 00:28:30,123
whatever's happened,

470
00:28:30,123 --> 00:28:32,043
it can't be more important than the baby.

471
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:36,663
Second Miss, I beg of you!

472
00:28:40,863 --> 00:28:43,943
Lady, 13th Prince is here to see you.

473
00:28:46,283 --> 00:28:48,143
Say that I'm already resting.

474
00:28:50,663 --> 00:28:51,983
Lady said that--

475
00:28:55,223 --> 00:28:56,583
Ruoxi,

476
00:28:58,463 --> 00:28:59,823
who knew that even for me,

477
00:28:59,823 --> 00:29:02,223
there would come a day when I'd be refused.

478
00:29:02,223 --> 00:29:03,723
Now the Emperor

479
00:29:03,723 --> 00:29:06,903
can't say that he's the only one.

480
00:29:06,903 --> 00:29:09,923
Greetings, 13th Prince.

481
00:29:09,923 --> 00:29:11,263
What's happened?

482
00:29:15,883 --> 00:29:17,403
Ruoxi,

483
00:29:18,503 --> 00:29:20,543
if I've done anything wrong,

484
00:29:20,543 --> 00:29:22,783
you can tell me.

485
00:29:22,783 --> 00:29:24,023
Between you and I,

486
00:29:24,023 --> 00:29:26,103
what is there that cannot be said?

487
00:29:30,783 --> 00:29:32,423
You can leave.

488
00:29:40,263 --> 00:29:44,143
It's not you who has done wrong,

489
00:29:44,143 --> 00:29:48,863
it's me. It's me!

490
00:29:48,863 --> 00:29:50,623
What are you saying?

491
00:29:50,623 --> 00:29:54,223
Because of me, you suffered for 10 years,

492
00:29:54,223 --> 00:29:58,563
- ending up with such ill heath.
- Ruoxi,

493
00:29:58,563 --> 00:30:00,723
what exactly happened?

494
00:30:00,723 --> 00:30:02,903
Why are you saying these things suddenly?

495
00:30:06,123 --> 00:30:08,683
I met with 8th Fu'jin today.

496
00:30:10,023 --> 00:30:11,743
What did she say?

497
00:30:13,083 --> 00:30:15,903
She helped pass on a message from 9th Prince.

498
00:30:16,643 --> 00:30:19,663
For what they have suffered,

499
00:30:19,663 --> 00:30:22,943
I will not be spared from it.

500
00:30:31,863 --> 00:30:33,703
What happened between you and 8th Prince,

501
00:30:35,623 --> 00:30:37,623
does 9th know it?

502
00:30:39,383 --> 00:30:41,703
He should.

503
00:30:42,743 --> 00:30:45,663
8th Prince wouldn't have deliberately hidden anything from them.

504
00:30:46,683 --> 00:30:48,603
10th Prince and 14th Prince

505
00:30:48,603 --> 00:30:51,343
probably also know about it too.

506
00:30:55,063 --> 00:30:56,463
Ruoxi,

507
00:30:57,403 --> 00:30:59,463
I have to ask you this.

508
00:31:00,663 --> 00:31:03,183
Back then, the relationship you had with 8th Brother

509
00:31:04,063 --> 00:31:06,303
how far did you progress with it?

510
00:31:07,583 --> 00:31:10,303
Did anything happen?

511
00:31:11,763 --> 00:31:14,123
Is that important?

512
00:31:19,383 --> 00:31:22,303
If the Emperor knows about this,

513
00:31:23,363 --> 00:31:25,823
the first to get punished will be 8th Brother.

514
00:31:28,383 --> 00:31:29,543
Not until the very last minute,

515
00:31:29,543 --> 00:31:30,943
will they probably use this

516
00:31:30,943 --> 00:31:32,983
to hurt the Emperor.

517
00:31:32,983 --> 00:31:34,983
From what I see,

518
00:31:34,983 --> 00:31:37,623
this is probably only 9th Brother's wishful thinking on his own part.

519
00:31:37,903 --> 00:31:39,203
With 8th Brother's personality,

520
00:31:39,203 --> 00:31:42,123
he won't let anything happen.

521
00:31:42,123 --> 00:31:43,983
If it is only because of this,

522
00:31:43,983 --> 00:31:47,343
Ruoxi, you can stop worrying,

523
00:31:47,343 --> 00:31:49,223
I will handle this.

524
00:31:50,103 --> 00:31:51,983
13th Prince,

525
00:31:53,303 --> 00:31:56,623
I do not deserve you treating me so well!

526
00:32:01,223 --> 00:32:04,223
Ruoxi! Rouxi!

527
00:32:04,223 --> 00:32:06,883
The physician! Call for the physician!

528
00:32:06,883 --> 00:32:09,303
Quick call for him! Quick!

529
00:32:09,303 --> 00:32:10,503
Second Miss!

530
00:32:10,503 --> 00:32:11,503
Ruo Xi! Second Miss!

531
00:32:11,503 --> 00:32:12,363
Second Miss!

532
00:32:12,363 --> 00:32:14,163
What happened to you?!

533
00:32:14,163 --> 00:32:15,123
Call for the physician!

534
00:32:15,123 --> 00:32:17,003
Quick!

535
00:32:17,003 --> 00:32:18,343
My baby...

536
00:32:18,343 --> 00:32:20,063
Ruoxi!

537
00:32:29,623 --> 00:32:30,503
Ruoxi!

538
00:32:30,503 --> 00:32:32,683
Physician! Physician!

539
00:32:32,683 --> 00:32:33,263
Ruoxi!

540
00:32:33,263 --> 00:32:34,983
Greetings, Your Majesty!

541
00:32:45,423 --> 00:32:46,643
Ruoxi!

542
00:32:46,643 --> 00:32:50,283
Ruoxi!

543
00:32:50,283 --> 00:32:51,963
I asked you to come and persuade her!

544
00:32:51,963 --> 00:32:53,923
How did things become like this!

545
00:33:00,143 --> 00:33:03,443
Listen well! Protect this baby!

546
00:33:03,443 --> 00:33:05,763
Or else you'll definitely get it!

547
00:33:05,763 --> 00:33:07,423
Yes.

548
00:33:09,203 --> 00:33:12,623
I can only do my best to protect the mother.

549
00:33:33,043 --> 00:33:34,943
This is a report regarding 10th Brother

550
00:33:34,943 --> 00:33:37,923
disrespecting me and rebelling against my order!

551
00:33:37,923 --> 00:33:39,863
And these are reports regarding you!

552
00:33:40,503 --> 00:33:43,703
Not doing your duties and conspiring with others.

553
00:33:43,703 --> 00:33:46,023
So are all of these!

554
00:33:47,583 --> 00:33:50,063
These are about your good wife,

555
00:33:50,063 --> 00:33:51,703
Gorolo Minghui.

556
00:33:52,263 --> 00:33:54,403
When I titled you a prince,

557
00:33:54,403 --> 00:33:56,523
she actually dared to speak out against me

558
00:33:56,523 --> 00:33:58,823
and say that I was wrecking our relationship!

559
00:33:58,823 --> 00:34:01,043
Spoiling the name of the Imperial family.

560
00:34:01,043 --> 00:34:02,463
From what I see,

561
00:34:02,463 --> 00:34:04,403
whatever you've done in the past,

562
00:34:04,403 --> 00:34:06,863
is all because of this wife you have!

563
00:34:17,783 --> 00:34:20,382
I have not taught my wife well.

564
00:34:20,382 --> 00:34:22,703
Please hand down your punishment.

565
00:34:22,703 --> 00:34:26,123
This kind of a wife, the Imperial family cannot stand for.

566
00:34:26,123 --> 00:34:29,062
I order you to obey in three days,

567
00:34:29,062 --> 00:34:31,583
to have 8th Fujin, Gorolo Minghui returned to her home.

568
00:34:31,583 --> 00:34:34,423
If not, don't say that I did not take our brotherly ties into account!

569
00:34:36,603 --> 00:34:38,903
I have always given in to you,

570
00:34:39,783 --> 00:34:41,263
but why are you still

571
00:34:41,263 --> 00:34:43,022
forcing me into a corner?!

572
00:34:43,022 --> 00:34:46,542
If you divorce your wife now, you can still keep your life.

573
00:34:49,183 --> 00:34:50,823
Minghui's crimes,

574
00:34:51,503 --> 00:34:54,263
I will take upon myself.

575
00:34:55,143 --> 00:34:56,602
As a man,

576
00:34:56,602 --> 00:35:00,043
I will not let my wife suffer!

577
00:35:01,743 --> 00:35:04,143
To have to divorce my wife,

578
00:35:04,143 --> 00:35:07,683
I'd rather die than to obey.

579
00:35:07,683 --> 00:35:09,743
By refusing an Imperial edict,

580
00:35:09,743 --> 00:35:12,023
I can execute your entire family!

581
00:35:13,743 --> 00:35:16,343
Ever since you became the Emperor,

582
00:35:16,983 --> 00:35:18,763
my whole family

583
00:35:18,763 --> 00:35:21,103
already became offerings (to the dead),

584
00:35:21,103 --> 00:35:22,703
you can do whatever you want.

585
00:35:25,783 --> 00:35:30,043
I have no more aspirations or goals.

586
00:35:30,043 --> 00:35:34,363
I just want to grow old with Minghui.

587
00:35:34,363 --> 00:35:36,563
If this is so hard to grant,

588
00:35:37,663 --> 00:35:40,743
then you might as well kill us.

589
00:35:40,743 --> 00:35:42,583
Because of just one person,

590
00:35:42,583 --> 00:35:45,463
you're willing to give up the lives of everyone in your manor?

591
00:35:45,463 --> 00:35:49,163
I'd rather die, than to do such a thing.

592
00:35:49,163 --> 00:35:52,423
A pack of foolishness.

593
00:35:53,143 --> 00:35:56,123
I order you to kneel at Yangxin Palace

594
00:35:56,123 --> 00:35:58,183
as a warning to others!

595
00:36:07,623 --> 00:36:11,103
Your Majesty, even if she wakes up,

596
00:36:11,103 --> 00:36:14,183
I'm afraid it will be hard for her to become pregnant again.

597
00:36:20,143 --> 00:36:22,343
Do not tell others of this.

598
00:36:23,263 --> 00:36:25,783
Especially Ruoxi.

599
00:36:25,783 --> 00:36:27,263
Yes.

600
00:37:03,863 --> 00:37:05,903
Your Majesty,

601
00:37:05,903 --> 00:37:08,183
8th Prince has had problems with his legs for so many years

602
00:37:08,183 --> 00:37:10,023
and it's so cold outside now,

603
00:37:10,023 --> 00:37:11,763
if he continues kneeling like this,

604
00:37:11,763 --> 00:37:13,623
he's going to lose his legs.

605
00:37:13,623 --> 00:37:15,023
Have you forgotten

606
00:37:15,023 --> 00:37:17,303
how he treated you back then?

607
00:37:18,263 --> 00:37:21,343
Didn't he also give you, your leg problems?

608
00:37:25,263 --> 00:37:27,543
Do you know what the physician said?

609
00:37:28,303 --> 00:37:30,383
Ruoxi's life is hanging by a thread now

610
00:37:31,183 --> 00:37:33,783
and even if she manages to wake up,

611
00:37:33,783 --> 00:37:36,423
she won't be able to have children anymore.

612
00:37:39,103 --> 00:37:42,903
Who can understand my pain?

613
00:37:43,303 --> 00:37:46,703
I've been kind enough to him!

614
00:37:51,103 --> 00:37:53,263
Gao Wuyong!

615
00:37:53,263 --> 00:37:54,723
Your servant is here.

616
00:37:54,723 --> 00:37:56,803
8th Prince has refused my Imperial decree,

617
00:37:56,803 --> 00:37:58,723
and said a lot of nonsense.

618
00:37:58,723 --> 00:38:02,303
On account of brotherly ties, I will not pursue it any further.

619
00:38:04,263 --> 00:38:06,823
Send him back to his manor.

620
00:38:06,823 --> 00:38:09,743
Escort him all the way, make sure he doesn't ride the sedan.

621
00:38:09,743 --> 00:38:11,423
Understood.

622
00:40:53,683 --> 00:40:55,703
Wang'ye, Wang'ye.

623
00:40:55,703 --> 00:40:57,863
Don't cry anymore

624
00:40:57,863 --> 00:40:59,383
Where has the 8th Fujin who dared to

625
00:40:59,383 --> 00:41:01,263
love and hate as she pleased, go to?

626
00:41:05,023 --> 00:41:09,143
Minghui, what exactly did you do?

627
00:41:09,143 --> 00:41:12,443
The Emperor was livid.

628
00:41:12,443 --> 00:41:14,103
I went into the Palace

629
00:41:15,583 --> 00:41:17,823
to look for Ruoxi.

630
00:41:18,383 --> 00:41:19,943
Why were you looking for her?

631
00:41:21,843 --> 00:41:25,703
She's the apple in the Emperor's eyes.

632
00:41:25,703 --> 00:41:27,823
I only went to beg her

633
00:41:27,863 --> 00:41:30,423
to ask the Emperor, on account of your past relatioship,

634
00:41:30,423 --> 00:41:33,863
to let a bunch of his brothers off,

635
00:41:33,863 --> 00:41:36,903
instead of being so heartless.

636
00:41:40,063 --> 00:41:45,383
Were you... punished because of me?

637
00:41:47,583 --> 00:41:49,883
You didn't do anything,

638
00:41:49,883 --> 00:41:52,983
how would the Emperor be able to fault you?

639
00:43:34,343 --> 00:43:35,943
Ruoxi...

640
00:43:38,543 --> 00:43:40,063
Ruoxi.

641
00:43:42,783 --> 00:43:44,903
Fourth Prince.

642
00:43:48,283 --> 00:43:49,483
Ruoxi.

643
00:43:49,483 --> 00:43:51,983
Physician! Quick take a look!

644
00:44:00,743 --> 00:44:02,343
Your Majesty, please don't be anxious,

645
00:44:02,343 --> 00:44:04,183
she just temporarily fainted.

646
00:44:04,183 --> 00:44:06,843
I will attend to her immediately.

647
00:44:06,843 --> 00:44:07,743
Quick!

648
00:44:14,603 --> 00:44:16,983
Don't be too worried.

649
00:44:16,983 --> 00:44:19,283
Nothing will happen to Ruoxi.

650
00:44:43,663 --> 00:44:45,363
Qiaohui.

651
00:44:45,363 --> 00:44:47,983
Second Miss.

652
00:44:47,983 --> 00:44:50,303
Second Miss, you're awake.

653
00:44:55,503 --> 00:44:57,343
It's been hard on you.

654
00:44:57,343 --> 00:45:01,343
Second Miss, I slipped up.

655
00:45:02,583 --> 00:45:05,543
If I were not so worried about you,

656
00:45:05,543 --> 00:45:08,103
I would have gone to look for Madam to ask for forgiveness.

657
00:45:08,103 --> 00:45:12,323
No. Where are the others?

658
00:45:12,323 --> 00:45:14,023
Mei Xiang and Ju Yue are preparing the medicine.

659
00:45:14,023 --> 00:45:15,623
The Emperor is attending court.

660
00:45:15,623 --> 00:45:17,223
Other than attending to court matters,

661
00:45:17,223 --> 00:45:19,263
he has been here watching over you day and night.

662
00:45:20,263 --> 00:45:23,403
When I was still oblivious and wanted to drink water,

663
00:45:23,403 --> 00:45:24,983
who attended to me?

664
00:45:24,983 --> 00:45:29,363
It was the Emperor. We were all outside.

665
00:45:29,363 --> 00:45:31,783
Did he pursue this matter?

666
00:45:31,783 --> 00:45:33,683
I don't know.

667
00:45:34,543 --> 00:45:37,823
I only have you by my side.

668
00:45:37,823 --> 00:45:39,583
Are you also going to

669
00:45:39,583 --> 00:45:42,023
fool me with words in the future?

670
00:45:42,023 --> 00:45:44,163
What's the point of having you by my side then?

671
00:45:44,163 --> 00:45:45,863
Second Miss.

672
00:45:45,863 --> 00:45:48,103
I helped 8th Fujin to pass along a message

673
00:45:48,103 --> 00:45:50,143
and I've already caused the death of your child.

674
00:45:50,143 --> 00:45:51,783
I...

675
00:45:53,443 --> 00:45:56,043
It's not your fault.

676
00:45:57,123 --> 00:45:58,523
A lot of things

677
00:45:58,523 --> 00:46:00,903
cannot be avoided, no matter what.

678
00:46:00,903 --> 00:46:03,683
There is no effect without a cause.

679
00:46:03,683 --> 00:46:08,343
You don't know the story in between, that's why you're blaming yourself.

680
00:46:08,343 --> 00:46:11,063
But it actually had nothing to do with you at all.

681
00:46:12,063 --> 00:46:14,123
13th Prince asked me privately,

682
00:46:14,123 --> 00:46:16,903
what 8th Fujin said to you.

683
00:46:16,903 --> 00:46:19,583
I said that I didn't know.

684
00:46:19,583 --> 00:46:21,423
He only told me,

685
00:46:21,423 --> 00:46:24,503
not to have anything to do with her anymore in the future.

686
00:46:24,503 --> 00:46:27,103
His Majesty was only concerned about your health

687
00:46:27,103 --> 00:46:29,743
and has never mentioned anything about the child.

688
00:46:29,743 --> 00:46:32,463
I also did not dare ask.

689
00:46:32,463 --> 00:46:35,343
Does he know that I met with 8th Fujin?

690
00:46:37,343 --> 00:46:39,263
I don't know.

691
00:46:42,423 --> 00:46:43,803
Lady is awake!

692
00:46:43,803 --> 00:46:45,503
The physician said that she would wake up today.

693
00:46:45,503 --> 00:46:47,623
He was really right!

694
00:47:08,163 --> 00:47:10,823
His Majesty arrives!

695
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:26,540
♫  Stopping here, afraid to go any further ♫

696
00:47:27,770 --> 00:47:32,470
♫  so sorrow will be unable to make an appearance.  ♫

697
00:47:34,450 --> 00:47:39,810
♫  On the next page, the farewell penned by you,  ♫

698
00:47:40,630 --> 00:47:45,670
♫  it was not up to me to refuse  ♫

699
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:52,530
♫  We’ve walked down this path too hastily  ♫

700
00:47:53,690 --> 00:47:59,590
♫  Embracing desires that weren’t realistic  ♫

701
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:06,090
♫  Not in time, wasn’t able to wait long enough to look back and admire  ♫

702
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:11,340
♫  The fragrance of magnolia is unable to hide wounds  ♫

703
00:48:11,870 --> 00:48:18,460
♫  No longer looking for the sun’s rays peeking through the clouds  ♫

704
00:48:18,460 --> 00:48:24,420
♫  No longer looking for the paradise that we promised each other  ♫

705
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:31,300
♫  No longer sighing, you once said that life is unpredictable  ♫

706
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:39,390
♫  The three inches of sunlight that I was unable to borrow  ♫

707
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:47,640
♫  No longer looking for the sunlight peeking through the clouds  ♫

708
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:54,140
♫  No longer looking for the paradise that we promised each other  ♫

709
00:48:54,140 --> 00:49:00,580
♫  No longer sighing, you once said that life is unpredictable  ♫

710
00:49:00,580 --> 00:49:06,990
♫  The three inches of sunlight that I was unable to borrow  ♫

711
00:49:06,990 --> 00:49:16,210
♫  That paradise is the place where I’d loved you  ♫
