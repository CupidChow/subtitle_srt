3
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:24,180
♫  We were destined to seek our doom like moths flying towards the flame  ♫

7

♫  Just another brushing of the shoulder, and from then...♫

Scarlet Heart
Episode 34

24
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,460
Second Miss, be careful.

25
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,780
Aiya, Second Miss!

26
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:23,260
That's against tradition! You're supposed to wait for Fourteenth Prince to lift the veil!

27
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:24,260
Your servant, Chen'xiang.

28
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:25,280
Your servant, Luo'xia.

29
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,580
We pay our respects to Cefujin.

30
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:28,460
You may rise.

31
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,260
Wang'ye ordered us to serve Cefujin.

32
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:34,600
This must be Senior Sister Qiaohui.

33
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,940
In the future, if there's anywhere we are not attentive to in serving Mistress,

34
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:38,900
we will need much of your guidance.

35
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:39,960
Second Miss, look.

36
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,360
Where did Fourteenth Prince find such capable girls?

37
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,820
Their smiles are so sweet, honey almost flows out from them.

38
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:46,500
Much thanks for your praise.

39
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:51,580
Wang'ye saw that I was pleasant and thus ordered me to serve Fujin to make her smile more.

40
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:52,900
You may leave first.

41
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,060
- Yes.
- Yes.

42
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:59,200
Qiaohui, don't you find it strange?

43
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,420
Inside this estate, the atmosphere seems to be celebratory,

44
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:03,460
but it doesn't feel like a wedding ceremony.

45
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:05,420
I was just pondering on the same thing.

46
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:07,900
From the time I entered until now, I've never seen a celebratory word.

47
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:10,160
I haven't seen the Fourteenth Prince.

48
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:12,200
Even up to this moment, I still don't see him.

49
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,560
It's my fault that I just praised him.

50
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,120
Qiaohui...

51
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,560
What did you just praise me for?

52
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,720
Greetings to the Fourteenth Prince!

53
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,560
It's alright, rise.

54
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,860
Are you tired?

55
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,460
Why don't you sit down for a bit.

56
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:34,080
Qiaohui, you still haven't answered me.

57
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,540
What did you just praise me for?

58
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:42,940
When your servant passed through the front gates,

59
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:44,880
I saw the entrance was quite festive.

60
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:47,020
I even praised Fourteenth Prince by saying

61
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:49,880
it was all thanks to your deep childhood friendship with Second Miss.

62
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:54,140
But right now, there's not even a 'xi' character anywhere.
(xi - happiness, two side by side characters for double happiness)

63
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:57,000
This is the problem with having a maid who grew up with you,

64
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,540
but who is older than you in age.

65
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,220
Isn't this what you taught her?

66
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:05,200
I heard Tenth Brother say that before you came to the Eighth Prince's estate,

67
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,000
Qiaohui was very obedient.

68
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,960
But after following this sly mouth of yours, that even Tenth Brother had to face soft barbs.

69
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,960
I...

70
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,660
The Emperor has decreed,

71
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:16,100
that we are not allowed to perform a big wedding ceremony.

72
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,480
And the decorations inside the estate

73
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,100
are not allowed to include the word 'xi'.

74
00:04:22,179 --> 00:04:23,659
It was the Emperor.

75
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,159
Then how come the estate

76
00:04:26,159 --> 00:04:27,900
has lanterns and festive hangings?

77
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:30,740
I didn't want you to see and think it's bare and gloomy,

78
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:32,580
so I had it decorated simply.

79
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:35,440
I don't mind it.

80
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,060
But must you rebel against his words?

81
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:39,900
It's fine if it's not allowed.

82
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:42,000
Why must you two quarrel about these things?

83
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
If the Emperor hears about this, it will become yet another issue.

84
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,160
What is there to be afraid of?

85
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,180
I have the decree of the past Emperor.

86
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:51,140
Ruoxi,

87
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:52,780
do you want to go out and meet the other people?

88
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:54,320
There's no need.

89
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:58,740
You also know, I have come here for peace and tranquility.

90
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:05,140
All right. Everything will be according to your wishes.

91
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:18,380
What is it?

92
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,700
This is a secret report.

93
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:31,620
Maertai Ruoxi wore a red veil to enter Fourteenth Prince's Estate?

94
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,500
Wasn't it ordered

95
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:36,700
not to allow this to be a formal traditional ceremony?

96
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:38,860
Only she has the guts.

97
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:41,660
What's more,

98
00:05:42,339 --> 00:05:44,224
when she was eating with 14th Brother's other primary wives,

99
00:05:45,492 --> 00:05:47,633
she dared to leave the table before them

100
00:05:47,633 --> 00:05:49,620
and doesn't give them any face.

101
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,864
Her personality is very headstrong,

102
00:05:57,864 --> 00:05:59,702
so she doesn't respect some things.

103
00:06:02,366 --> 00:06:06,340
Looks like she doesn't care for 14th romantically at all.

104
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,660
Second Miss, don't write anymore.

105
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:19,780
You're not trying to be top scholar.

106
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:21,924
Let's go see Chen'xiang kick the shuttlecock.

107
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:28,008
You wrote enough to fill half the chest.

108
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,280
Is it?

109
00:06:30,258 --> 00:06:31,767
I didn't even realize that

110
00:06:31,767 --> 00:06:32,953
I wrote that much.

111
00:06:38,735 --> 00:06:41,160
Second Miss wrote down sentimental feelings

112
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,256
that are revealed by each stroke.

113
00:06:43,969 --> 00:06:47,314
- Senior Qiao'hui, come quickly. Let's go play together.

114
00:06:47,314 --> 00:06:49,580
Second Miss, Chen'xiang is calling us.

115
00:06:50,613 --> 00:06:51,945
Well, all right then.

116
00:06:51,945 --> 00:06:53,967
You go first, I'll follow later.

117
00:06:53,967 --> 00:06:55,586
Then I'll stay outside to wait for you.

118
00:07:05,885 --> 00:07:07,300
Such a beautiful masterpiece,

119
00:07:09,077 --> 00:07:10,740
but mine only resembles his in appearance...

120
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,084
In my heart,

121
00:07:42,084 --> 00:07:43,744
there's only him and I left.

122
00:07:44,706 --> 00:07:47,157
Every small bit that he and I shared,

123
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,321
a smile, a joke,

124
00:07:51,321 --> 00:07:53,016
a sigh.

125
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,735
I selfishly put aside everyone else and then forget them.

126
00:07:57,735 --> 00:08:00,655
All that's left behind is everything he and I shared.

127
00:08:02,018 --> 00:08:06,685
For the first time, no one can bother us.

128
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,968
The first time

129
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,300
where I don't have any worries

130
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,510
and I can begin to love him again.

131
00:10:57,375 --> 00:10:58,822
It is my fault.

132
00:10:58,822 --> 00:11:00,680
It's not your fault.

133
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:03,760
Who's secretly spying?  Come out!

134
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:05,780
It's so cold,

135
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:07,340
yet you're so hot-tempered.

136
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:13,980
Fu'jin,

137
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:16,460
between us, formality is not necessary.

138
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,480
I shall leave first then.

139
00:11:30,782 --> 00:11:32,753
Ruo'xi, if you want to see something,

140
00:11:32,753 --> 00:11:34,518
why not see it openly?

141
00:11:34,518 --> 00:11:35,940
Wouldn't that be much better?

142
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:51,322
The weather is so cold. You need to wear more clothes.

143
00:11:51,322 --> 00:11:53,480
You just perspired. Be careful about getting sick.

144
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:56,580
Between us two, who is colder?

145
00:11:59,287 --> 00:12:00,560
It's me who is colder.

146
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,720
It's cold.

147
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,620
Let's go inside the manor.

148
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:19,465
Come take a look at what 14th Brother has written.

149
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:27,745
[ The rascal Liu'bang now controls Wei'yang Palace.]
(This was written by the real 14th Prince in history)

150
00:12:27,745 --> 00:12:31,421
[ The hero, Xiang'yu, has killed himself at He'xia.]

151
00:12:31,421 --> 00:12:34,240
[ It is well-known that brave heroes always end up pitiful.]

152
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,260
[ I can only sigh and bury my great ambition under the stones...]

153
00:12:41,423 --> 00:12:42,660
I think it is only 14th Brother

154
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:45,940
speaking out of anger in a heated moment.

155
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:48,220
You should not take it too seriously.

156
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:51,560
He purposely wrote that letter to anger me,

157
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:55,231
but I could've chosen not to read his letter.

158
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:57,160
Emperor,

159
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,092
the secret letter from ZunHua has arrived.

160
00:13:25,202 --> 00:13:26,817
13th Brother.

161
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:32,420
At that time when you persuaded me to let her go, you told me

162
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,740
she and 14th Brother are not in a real relationship.

163
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:42,580
Do you know what this secret letter writer person saw?

164
00:13:48,987 --> 00:13:52,520
"Ce Fu'jin of 14th Prince,

165
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:56,200
Maertaixi watched Wang Ye's sword dance and

166
00:13:57,205 --> 00:13:59,780
wiped the sweat from 14th Prince.

167
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:04,260
14th Prince warmed her hands.

168
00:14:05,244 --> 00:14:08,543
Both of them laughed together and

169
00:14:08,543 --> 00:14:10,540
held hands while walking."

170
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:15,660
In response, I believe,

171
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:16,920
firstly,

172
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:20,067
Ruo'xi has always thought a man-woman relationship as deeply as us.

173
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:22,925
The more open-minded she is, the more she doesn't pay attention.

174
00:14:22,925 --> 00:14:23,875
Secondly, the person who wrote the letter

175
00:14:23,875 --> 00:14:26,920
wouldn't know what they were talking about, but

176
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:29,706
only heard them laughing.

177
00:14:29,706 --> 00:14:30,432
This kind of thing,

178
00:14:30,432 --> 00:14:32,980
from an outsider's viewpoint, would look very intimate,

179
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:36,221
when in fact, the parties involved were not thinking that way at all.

180
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:41,180
Late at night, two people under the same roof,

181
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:43,698
what more is there to know other than what they're talking about?

182
00:14:43,698 --> 00:14:45,280
Please don't be upset.

183
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:48,920
Is it, you not only don't trust 14th Brother,

184
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,423
but you also

185
00:14:50,423 --> 00:14:52,300
don't even trust Ruo'xi?

186
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,760
Enough!

187
00:15:00,474 --> 00:15:02,320
From today onward,

188
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:05,420
the things between 14th Brother and Ruo'xi,

189
00:15:07,225 --> 00:15:09,860
no need to report them to me anymore!

190
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,140
Open the door.

191
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:31,780
Let me in.

192
00:15:33,081 --> 00:15:36,700
Open the door, I want to drink with you.

193
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:39,460
Ruo'xi, open the door.

194
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,285
Ruo'xi...

195
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:49,620
Today I want to stay here to drink.

196
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:12,780
Ruo'xi... come here.

197
00:16:20,929 --> 00:16:23,940
I know I shouldn't think this way,

198
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,980
but I don't feel it's at all fair!

199
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:33,360
If Imperial Father had given me the throne back then,

200
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,563
today, the person in control of the country

201
00:16:36,563 --> 00:16:38,620
would be me.

202
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:44,480
The endings for a few of my brothers would definitely have not turned out this way.

203
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:50,700
Long Keduo and Nian Gengyao, these dog servants,

204
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:54,560
would not be so arrogant!

205
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,468
14th Prince,

206
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:01,800
the former Emperor's decision

207
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:05,320
was also not made overnight.

208
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,540
Right.

209
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:14,340
What can be done now?

210
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,459
What can I still do?

211
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:45,700
"Youthful chivalry without fear,
(Reciting a poem)

212
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:58,780
in bravery,

213
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:09,980
...raise your hair up,

214
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:15,620
stand up straight...

215
00:18:16,341 --> 00:18:22,140
...life and death,

216
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:28,140
... honor's importance..."

217
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:31,740
What did I do wrong?

218
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,620
Why?

219
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:42,020
What did I do wrong in the end?

220
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,580
I'm sorry.

221
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:18,100
In those days, the three of us were like dogs that only fought.

222
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:22,420
Now, one has passed away. (Minghui, 8th Consort)

223
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:24,680
One is being imprisoned. (Mingyu, 10th Consort)

224
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:28,940
One sits quietly here,

225
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:31,880
waiting for the flowers to wither. (Rouxi)

226
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,400
Ce'Fu'jin...

227
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,520
Is she asleep?

228
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:46,340
Lately, Ce'Fu'jin has been dozing off quite often.

229
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:48,660
I've heard people say

230
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:53,160
pregnant women sleep more often. Should we call a physician?

231
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:02,260
Second Miss, Second Miss.

232
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,740
If you are tired,

233
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:06,540
lay on the bed to take a rest.

234
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,180
- Ce'Fu'jin!
-  Second Miss!
- Ce'Fu'jin!

235
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:20,340
- Ce'Fu'jin, what's wrong?
-  Second Miss?

236
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:21,400
How are you, Ce'Fu'jin?

237
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,620
Go away!

238
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:25,480
Leave!

239
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,400
You all go find one!

240
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,400
Go find one!  Go now!

241
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,660
14th Prince.

242
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,260
Ruoxi, don't worry.

243
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:38,020
I will definitely find you a very good doctor.

244
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:42,020
A few doctors already have said it's the end of the road.

245
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:44,900
Finding another one, he will only say the same.

246
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:47,440
That's because their knowledge is limited.

247
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,940
How can this be the end?

248
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:51,720
Back then the Imperial Physician

249
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,300
told me that too.

250
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,540
Qiao'hui.

251
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:18,180
Second Miss.

252
00:21:21,802 --> 00:21:23,620
I'm sorry.

253
00:21:26,252 --> 00:21:28,050
I'm tired now.

254
00:21:42,581 --> 00:21:45,024
Second Miss.

255
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:01,700
4th Prince.

256
00:22:08,736 --> 00:22:10,140
4th Prince.

257
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,447
4th Prince.

258
00:22:20,538 --> 00:22:25,740
4th Prince... 4th Prince...

259
00:22:26,054 --> 00:22:29,220
Second Miss, Second Miss.

260
00:22:29,616 --> 00:22:31,380
Second Miss, wake up now.

261
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:33,420
4th Prince...

262
00:22:34,433 --> 00:22:36,008
Second Miss,

263
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,741
You've been calling for His Majesty nonstop.

264
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:51,478
Help me prepare some ink.

265
00:22:51,478 --> 00:22:53,091
Don't write now,

266
00:22:53,091 --> 00:22:54,900
rest now.

267
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,920
I need to write a letter.

268
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:00,440
Help me get some paper.

269
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,580
Request 14th Prince to come over.

270
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:30,930
Yes.

271
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:32,940
Ruoxi.

272
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:34,780
- Greetings, 14th Prince.
-  Greetings, 14th Prince.

273
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:35,860
Rise.

274
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,040
Ruoxi.

275
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:44,939
Is there anything you feel like eating today?

276
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:48,680
Something simple would be good.

277
00:23:49,903 --> 00:23:51,016
Didn't you say that

278
00:23:51,016 --> 00:23:52,040
when you were young,

279
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,958
you loved to eat the special cakes from Yangguan?

280
00:23:53,958 --> 00:23:55,545
I ordered people to go get them.

281
00:23:55,545 --> 00:23:59,730
Oh right,  I've also ordered them to go find your favorite music Master.

282
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:01,543
He should arrive in a few days.

283
00:24:01,543 --> 00:24:04,040
Then whatever songs you want to listen to,

284
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:06,225
just ask him to play them for you.

285
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:18,724
Help me send this letter to His Majesty.

286
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,462
Quickly.

287
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:38,113
Rush it.

288
00:24:38,954 --> 00:24:44,468
By tomorrow or at the latest, by the following day.

289
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:48,300
He will then be able to see it

290
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:52,615
and then, maybe 3 days later,

291
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:56,410
I will be able to see him.

292
00:24:58,850 --> 00:25:00,310
Very good.

293
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:03,115
I have something to report as well.

294
00:25:03,115 --> 00:25:06,150
I'll order someone to deliver them together.

295
00:25:33,577 --> 00:25:35,230
My Ce'Fu'jin's handwriting

296
00:25:35,230 --> 00:25:37,530
and the Emperor's are so much alike.

297
00:25:37,530 --> 00:25:41,950
If this fact is made known, it will create more gossip.

298
00:26:12,330 --> 00:26:14,265
Emperor, this is from the 14th Prince.

299
00:26:14,265 --> 00:26:16,130
He requested someone to deliver this by express messenger.

300
00:26:18,089 --> 00:26:20,530
I don't know what other grievances he'd want to write about

301
00:26:20,530 --> 00:26:22,030
and I don't want to waste my time on him.

302
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:23,150
Put it to the side.

303
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:24,390
Yes.

304
00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:51,690
Second Miss!

305
00:26:51,930 --> 00:26:53,530
Second Miss, what's wrong?

306
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:55,310
Second Miss.

307
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:00,271
Why not lay on the bed to rest?

308
00:27:08,270 --> 00:27:11,050
I want to wait a bit longer.

309
00:27:57,630 --> 00:28:00,470
Second Miss, are you still waiting for the Emperor?

310
00:28:03,490 --> 00:28:06,230
He doesn't want to see me.

311
00:28:07,410 --> 00:28:09,891
Doesn't want to forgive me.

312
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:16,711
He must really hate me so much,

313
00:28:18,650 --> 00:28:22,632
that he refuses to see me this one last time.

314
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:27,390
No...

315
00:28:29,130 --> 00:28:32,350
He must not even hate me at all.

316
00:28:33,933 --> 00:28:36,618
He just feels unconcerned

317
00:28:37,461 --> 00:28:39,150
and doesn't care.

318
00:28:41,635 --> 00:28:43,716
It does not matter to him anymore.

319
00:28:45,179 --> 00:28:47,252
Second Miss, don't be like this.

320
00:28:47,252 --> 00:28:50,510
Perhaps His Majesty is being delayed by something.

321
00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:53,370
Court matters or the like, it's hard to say.

322
00:28:53,370 --> 00:28:56,915
Being delayed is more of a possibility.

323
00:28:56,915 --> 00:28:59,668
How can His Majesty not want to see Second Miss?

324
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:10,150
He will come then?

325
00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:11,905
He definitely will.

326
00:29:16,133 --> 00:29:18,910
I've overthought it too much.

327
00:29:56,668 --> 00:29:59,110
This is Yu'tan's, just before she died,

328
00:29:59,110 --> 00:30:01,154
this is the final testament,

329
00:30:02,850 --> 00:30:04,470
she wrote. After I die,

330
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:08,390
13th Prince will surely come to pay his respects.

331
00:30:09,676 --> 00:30:11,830
You're to secretly

332
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:17,215
give this letter and blood testament to him on my behalf.

333
00:30:18,755 --> 00:30:19,910
Remind him, he must

334
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:22,972
deliver this blood testament

335
00:30:22,972 --> 00:30:25,370
into 9th Prince's hands personally.

336
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:31,470
Second Miss must not speak of such a misfortunate thing.

337
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:35,010
You will be able to personally see the 13th Prince.

338
00:30:36,290 --> 00:30:37,770
Just pretend you are

339
00:30:37,770 --> 00:30:40,234
helping me hold on to this safely first.

340
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:43,630
Remember my words.

341
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:55,891
I don't have any money left.

342
00:30:57,130 --> 00:30:59,370
Just a small red box,

343
00:30:59,370 --> 00:31:01,650
inside there is some jewelry.

344
00:31:02,790 --> 00:31:05,179
Help me take half of it

345
00:31:05,179 --> 00:31:07,170
and give it to Wang'xi.

346
00:31:11,090 --> 00:31:13,190
Wang'xi is a smart person and

347
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:16,573
probably doesn't need it.

348
00:31:18,530 --> 00:31:20,790
If so, then give it to his brother instead.

349
00:31:26,030 --> 00:31:27,790
There's one more thing.

350
00:31:28,670 --> 00:31:31,010
It's about Lu Wu.

351
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:34,330
My words...

352
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:38,370
you need to store them in your heart,

353
00:31:38,370 --> 00:31:41,430
don't let anyone else know,

354
00:31:41,850 --> 00:31:44,350
especially 13th Prince.

355
00:31:47,410 --> 00:31:50,190
Lu Wu

356
00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:53,470
is already no longer here.

357
00:31:54,190 --> 00:31:57,110
On the day she disappeared,

358
00:31:57,430 --> 00:32:00,310
she had already drowned herself in the river.

359
00:32:02,890 --> 00:32:08,210
Only the Emperor and I knew the truth.

360
00:32:08,718 --> 00:32:12,285
We were afraid 13th Prince would be in too much pain,

361
00:32:13,176 --> 00:32:15,180
so we didn't tell him that truth.

362
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:19,430
Every year, on her death anniversary,

363
00:32:20,670 --> 00:32:23,110
I have urged Cheng'huan

364
00:32:23,110 --> 00:32:26,488
to burn joss sticks and pay respect to an "Auntie."

365
00:32:28,406 --> 00:32:33,290
This matter has been hidden from 13th Prince also.

366
00:32:34,415 --> 00:32:36,050
I hope that

367
00:32:36,050 --> 00:32:38,934
after 13th Prince passes away,

368
00:32:39,470 --> 00:32:42,742
you can personally tell Cheng'huan

369
00:32:44,066 --> 00:32:47,223
it is her mother's death anniversary.

370
00:32:51,301 --> 00:32:53,191
That will let Lu Wu,

371
00:32:53,191 --> 00:32:55,683
from the underworld, know

372
00:32:56,630 --> 00:32:58,632
and feel at peace.

373
00:33:12,338 --> 00:33:14,855
This is my gift for Cheng'huan.

374
00:33:18,749 --> 00:33:22,970
When she grows up, you tell her

375
00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:25,430
I already passed away.

376
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:38,214
Second Miss,

377
00:33:38,949 --> 00:33:42,255
if 13th Prince doesn't come, what should I do?

378
00:33:44,810 --> 00:33:47,310
He will definitely come.

379
00:33:54,230 --> 00:33:57,176
You took care of me and older sister for more than half your lifetime.

380
00:33:58,668 --> 00:34:00,550
In the remaining days,

381
00:34:00,550 --> 00:34:02,967
how you really want to live,

382
00:34:02,967 --> 00:34:06,991
just follow your own wishes.

383
00:34:08,810 --> 00:34:10,637
Second Miss.

384
00:34:18,610 --> 00:34:20,289
I'm tired.

385
00:34:36,973 --> 00:34:38,190
Emperor.

386
00:34:41,551 --> 00:34:43,510
Should we call the Imperial Physician?

387
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:45,917
No need, you may leave.

388
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:47,450
Yes.

389
00:35:06,281 --> 00:35:07,851
Emperor.

390
00:35:10,212 --> 00:35:11,705
Emperor.

391
00:35:27,643 --> 00:35:29,729
Emperor.

392
00:35:29,729 --> 00:35:31,256
Ruoxi!

393
00:36:34,510 --> 00:36:36,419
SecondMiss, you're awake.

394
00:36:36,419 --> 00:36:38,873
I'll help you up.

395
00:36:47,010 --> 00:36:48,890
Help me to wash up.

396
00:37:01,810 --> 00:37:03,410
Help me to get up.

397
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:23,054
4th Prince.

398
00:38:39,313 --> 00:38:43,355
Your favorite music Master came a few days ago.

399
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:45,398
Do you want to hear him?

400
00:38:48,883 --> 00:38:51,050
Take me outside to see him.

401
00:38:53,530 --> 00:38:56,830
Have all the apricot blossoms withered yet?

402
00:38:56,830 --> 00:38:58,550
Although the apricot blossoms have withered,

403
00:38:58,550 --> 00:39:00,450
the peach blossoms are blooming beautifully.

404
00:39:01,124 --> 00:39:02,110
Chen'xiang,

405
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:03,850
let the servants in the garden know

406
00:39:03,850 --> 00:39:05,930
Ce'Fu'jin wants to go admire the peach blossoms.

407
00:39:05,930 --> 00:39:07,411
Yes.

408
00:39:32,735 --> 00:39:34,290
Isn't it pretty?

409
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:42,387
The grass is so deeply green

410
00:39:43,010 --> 00:39:48,450
and the peach blossoms are richly red.

411
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:54,770
Are you cold?

412
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:11,830
The flowers are really beautiful.

413
00:40:11,830 --> 00:40:15,290
Yes, next year around this time,

414
00:40:16,336 --> 00:40:18,430
we will come here again

415
00:40:18,430 --> 00:40:20,770
and look at the peach blossoms together.

416
00:40:37,413 --> 00:40:39,930
I have a request of you.

417
00:40:41,252 --> 00:40:43,449
Can you promise me?

418
00:40:43,449 --> 00:40:47,048
Say it. I promise you.

419
00:40:50,531 --> 00:40:53,170
I don't want to rot and smell bad.

420
00:40:55,370 --> 00:41:00,570
After I die, cremate my body.

421
00:41:01,732 --> 00:41:04,450
And on a windy day,

422
00:41:04,981 --> 00:41:06,570
scatter my ashes.

423
00:41:08,410 --> 00:41:09,912
Ruoxi,

424
00:41:10,770 --> 00:41:13,110
you want to turn to ashes?

425
00:41:18,230 --> 00:41:19,650
It's not like that.

426
00:41:23,890 --> 00:41:27,530
I've always wanted to be free,

427
00:41:29,851 --> 00:41:33,418
but was stuck in the Forbidden City for life.

428
00:41:36,617 --> 00:41:38,210
After I die,

429
00:41:40,650 --> 00:41:44,730
I don't want to be held back anymore.

430
00:41:44,730 --> 00:41:47,050
I want to be like the wind.

431
00:41:47,970 --> 00:41:49,930
Isn't that a lot more lovely?

432
00:41:55,470 --> 00:42:01,625
What's so great about being buried in the ground

433
00:42:01,625 --> 00:42:04,170
and letting the worms eat away at you?

434
00:42:10,550 --> 00:42:13,150
This is my wish.

435
00:42:14,290 --> 00:42:16,282
Promise me.

436
00:42:22,916 --> 00:42:24,130
All right.

437
00:42:25,650 --> 00:42:28,090
I promise you.

438
00:42:32,270 --> 00:42:38,210
Ruo'xi, if there's a next life,

439
00:42:38,210 --> 00:42:40,810
would you still remember me?

440
00:42:46,570 --> 00:42:49,070
I will ask Meng'po
(Underworld servant who give souls the memory-erasing soup)

441
00:42:51,330 --> 00:42:54,050
for a couple more bowls of the forgetting soup,

442
00:42:59,010 --> 00:43:02,311
so that I can forget all of you

443
00:43:06,332 --> 00:43:10,170
and cleanly forget everything.

444
00:43:11,730 --> 00:43:13,430
14th Prince...

445
00:43:18,370 --> 00:43:22,234
live well.

446
00:43:28,070 --> 00:43:32,730
Let all that's in the past...

447
00:43:34,512 --> 00:43:41,330
be... forgotten.

448
00:44:03,770 --> 00:44:06,090
Second Miss!

449
00:44:15,570 --> 00:44:25,020
Timing and Subtitles brought to you by the Bu Bu Jing Xin Team @Viki.com

450
00:44:51,073 --> 00:44:57,570
14th Prince's concubine, Maertai Ruoxi, died yesterday.

451
00:45:02,850 --> 00:45:04,690
Maertai Ruoxi.

452
00:45:05,332 --> 00:45:06,690
Without my permission,

453
00:45:06,690 --> 00:45:08,090
you cannot die.

454
00:45:08,530 --> 00:45:10,450
You cannot die!

455
00:45:21,150 --> 00:45:23,970
Where's that letter?!

456
00:45:25,780 --> 00:45:26,810
Imperial Brother.

457
00:45:27,756 --> 00:45:28,938
That letter...

458
00:46:43,970 --> 00:46:48,130
♫ Stopping here, afraid to go any further,  ♫

459
00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:54,340
♫ so sorrow will be unable to make an appearance  ♫

460
00:46:56,180 --> 00:47:01,900
♫  On the next page, the farewell penned by you,  ♫

461
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:07,440
♫  it was not up to me to refuse  ♫

462
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:14,930
♫  We’ve walked down this path too hastily  ♫

463
00:47:14,930 --> 00:47:20,990
♫  Embracing desires that weren’t realistic  ♫

464
00:47:21,670 --> 00:47:27,410
♫  Not in time, wasn’t able to wait long enough to look back and admire  ♫

465
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:32,750
♫  The fragrance of magnolia is unable to hide wounds  ♫

466
00:47:33,460 --> 00:47:39,500
♫  No longer looking for the sun’s rays peeking through the clouds  ♫

467
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:45,980
♫  No longer looking for the paradise that we promised each other  ♫

468
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:52,470
♫  No longer sighing, you once said that life is unpredictable  ♫

469
00:47:52,990 --> 00:48:01,340
♫  The three inches of sunlight that I was unable to borrow  ♫

470
00:48:02,690 --> 00:48:08,680
♫  No longer looking for the sunlight peeking through the clouds  ♫

471
00:48:09,260 --> 00:48:15,040
♫  No longer looking for the paradise that we promised each other  ♫

472
00:48:15,730 --> 00:48:21,550
♫  No longer sighing, you once said that life is unpredictable  ♫

473
00:48:22,230 --> 00:48:28,030
♫  The three inches of sunlight that I was unable to borrow  ♫

474
00:48:28,650 --> 00:48:36,170
♫  That paradise is the place where I’d loved you  ♫
