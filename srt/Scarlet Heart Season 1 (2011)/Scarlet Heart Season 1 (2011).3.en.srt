♫  In the blink of an eye, a thought of stubborn persistence  ♫

3
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:24,630
♫  We were destined to seek our doom like moths flying towards the flame  ♫

4
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:32,300
♫  Knowing that it’d be a disaster, why am I still at a loss about what to do  ♫

5
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:39,190
♫  The best is not to see, the best is not to miss you  ♫

6
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:44,510
♫  Only like this can I not be in love with you  ♫

7
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:48,960
♫  Just another brushing of the shoulder, and from then..♫

8
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,500
♫  I’ll keep falling deeper and deeper in love with you  ♫

9
00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:02,430
♫  It’s the mistake of time, forcing us to pass each other by  ♫

10
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:05,570
♫  How I miss you, how far you are  ♫

11
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:12,300
♫  If though I’d known it’d only result in pain, at this moment, I still don’t want to escape  ♫

12
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:16,970
♫  Pity these words are too glaring they hurt the eyes  ♫

♫  Two worlds later ♫

14
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:25,500
♫  Don’t want to escape  ♫

15
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:30,540
♫  It’s the mistake of time, we can only pass each other by  ♫

16
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:35,310
♫  The magnitude of me missing you is as much as how far you are   ♫

17
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:41,960
♫  Even though I know the ending is a mistake that I cannot oppose  ♫

18
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:47,080
♫  Staying in this moment  ♫

19
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:55,270
♫  We can only accept that the feelings run deep, but fate is shallow  ♫

Scarlet Heart
- Episode 3 -

21
00:02:41,241 --> 00:02:43,371
Thirteenth Prince has arrived!

22
00:02:52,582 --> 00:02:53,596
- Thirteenth Brother.
-  Eighth Brother.

23
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:55,600
Sorry for making you wait long.

24
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,033
We finally awaited your arrival.

25
00:02:57,033 --> 00:02:58,756
I just finished doing some errands with the Crown Prince.

26
00:02:58,756 --> 00:02:59,800
He returned to his estate to change clothes,

27
00:03:00,196 --> 00:03:02,472
he asked us to eat first and not to wait for him.

28
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:04,956
- Come, this way.
- Thank you.
- Come.

29
00:03:05,156 --> 00:03:06,257
Fourth Brother.

30
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,400
Come! Thirteenth Brother, let's go in.

31
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:14,833
Go.

32
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:23,000
Sorry for the long wait.

33
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:23,857
We've been waiting for you for a long time!

34
00:03:23,857 --> 00:03:24,500
Tenth Brother.

35
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:27,851
The Maertai Ruoxi you keep speaking about is beautiful and elegant.

36
00:03:28,067 --> 00:03:29,967
If we were to talk about beautiful women, which of us haven't seen any?

37
00:03:30,433 --> 00:03:31,500
But today,

38
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:36,533
Eighth Brother, this sister-in-law of yours really does have an extraordinary bearing, and leaves an impression on people.

39
00:03:37,348 --> 00:03:40,767
Thirteenth Brother, don't just keep praising this immature sister-in-law of mine.

40
00:03:40,767 --> 00:03:43,567
Tenth Brother's been dying to drink with you!

41
00:03:43,567 --> 00:03:44,667
Is that so?

42
00:03:44,667 --> 00:03:45,833
Yes.

43
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:49,121
- What's the hurry?
- You're in for it tonight.

44
00:03:50,003 --> 00:03:51,400
When it comes to drinking, I'm only scared that there's no one to drink with me.

45
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,300
Drunken carousing is one of the biggest pleasures of life.

46
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,667
Today, we must get drunk. Everyone of us!

47
00:03:54,667 --> 00:03:55,800
Good!

48
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,267
Bring the wine.

49
00:03:56,699 --> 00:03:57,500
Good then, Thirteenth. Bring the wine.

50
00:03:57,828 --> 00:03:58,633
We were waiting for just those very words.

51
00:03:58,633 --> 00:03:59,333
Quickly. Come. Bring the wine.

52
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:00,200
Don't forget the last time you went drinking with me,

53
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,033
how you ended up?

54
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:03,200
This time, we must make you thoroughly drunk.

55
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:06,575
Come, drink.

56
00:04:06,575 --> 00:04:07,433
Can you do it?

57
00:04:07,882 --> 00:04:09,800
No problem!  Come. Drink.

58
00:04:13,216 --> 00:04:16,067
Come.  Who's afraid of whom?

59
00:04:16,529 --> 00:04:17,467
Your capacity for drinking is great.

60
00:04:18,215 --> 00:04:19,980
Yes, drink some more.

61
00:04:23,137 --> 00:04:26,553
Great. Your capacity for drinking is great.

62
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:27,600
Again.

63
00:04:31,867 --> 00:04:33,967
Drink, cheers.

64
00:04:39,533 --> 00:04:41,832
The Crown Prince has arrived!

65
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:44,133
Greetings to Crown Prince!

66
00:04:47,628 --> 00:04:48,935
Crown Prince.

67
00:04:49,667 --> 00:04:50,433
Everyone's excused from ceremony.

68
00:04:52,883 --> 00:04:54,367
Although I came late,

69
00:04:55,067 --> 00:04:57,867
I especially prepared a gift

70
00:04:58,067 --> 00:04:59,633
for Tenth Brother.

71
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:01,167
Oh? What good stuff did you bring me?

72
00:05:01,167 --> 00:05:02,600
Bring it out and let me see.

73
00:05:17,055 --> 00:05:22,200
Isn't this the jade ruyi* that was sent by Burma to Imperial Father as tribute?
(*an ornament with connotations of good fortune, often gifted)

74
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,533
Eighth Brother has great observation skills,

75
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:26,103
being able to tell at first sight.

76
00:05:26,103 --> 00:05:29,233
Burma sent Imperial Father four pieces as tribute.

77
00:05:29,233 --> 00:05:32,433
I personally chose one of them to give to Tenth Brother as a present.

78
00:05:33,267 --> 00:05:34,667
Taking tributes on your own accord to gift to others?

79
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:37,367
If Imperial Father were to know about this, you will get punished severely!

80
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:43,067
Fourteenth Brother, the Crown Prince is the apple of Imperial Father's eye.

81
00:05:43,067 --> 00:05:44,400
Someone else might get into trouble,

82
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,433
but the Crown Prince will definitely be all right.

83
00:05:47,101 --> 00:05:49,467
This gift from the Crown Prince is generous indeed.

84
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,467
But if Imperial Father learns of this,

85
00:05:51,467 --> 00:05:53,367
it might not be good, would it?

86
00:06:02,355 --> 00:06:03,667
I'm afraid that even though the Crown Prince gave this gift,

87
00:06:03,967 --> 00:06:06,800
Tenth Brother won't accept it either.

88
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:10,067
Why wouldn't I dare accept a present from the Crown Prince?

89
00:06:10,616 --> 00:06:12,759
Correct. What Tenth Brother said is correct.

90
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:16,033
Tenth Brother, the Crown Prince was playing a joke on us.

91
00:06:16,033 --> 00:06:19,667
He brought this jade ruyi here just to broaden our horizons.

92
00:06:19,667 --> 00:06:20,400
Think about it.

93
00:06:20,718 --> 00:06:23,000
Imperial Father already gave one to Imperial Grandmother,

94
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,867
and another to Imperial Concubine Mi.

95
00:06:24,867 --> 00:06:27,567
If you took a jade ruyi that was exactly the same too,

96
00:06:27,567 --> 00:06:29,467
wouldn't that be unfilial?

97
00:06:32,171 --> 00:06:34,367
Correct. What Fourth Brother said is correct.

98
00:06:34,367 --> 00:06:36,333
That was the reason.

99
00:06:36,733 --> 00:06:38,067
How about this, Tenth Brother?

100
00:06:38,067 --> 00:06:41,367
I'll send your present over in a few days.

101
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:44,200
What would be a good present?

102
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,400
Didn't the Crown Prince just import a few spirited red horses from the Northwest recently?

103
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,100
And didn't you just say you were going to give one to Tenth Brother?

104
00:06:51,467 --> 00:06:52,167
Right, right, right.

105
00:06:52,167 --> 00:06:53,767
What Thirteenth Brother said is correct.

106
00:06:53,933 --> 00:06:55,267
It will be those horses then.

107
00:06:55,267 --> 00:06:58,933
Tenth Brother, I'll personally pick the best one

108
00:06:58,933 --> 00:07:01,000
and order someone to send it over tomorrow.

109
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,133
Then I'll thank the Crown Prince in advance then.

110
00:07:04,656 --> 00:07:05,533
Ah, yes.

111
00:07:05,533 --> 00:07:09,467
Crown Prince has been here for so long, but we haven't let you pick a show yet. It's too impolite of us.

112
00:07:09,467 --> 00:07:10,112
Come, men.

113
00:07:10,112 --> 00:07:10,833
Yes.

114
00:07:11,567 --> 00:07:12,667
Tenth Brother,

115
00:07:12,667 --> 00:07:14,100
today is your birthday.

116
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,800
You should be the one picking the show.

117
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,233
I've already picked earlier.

118
00:07:17,233 --> 00:07:18,933
It's your turn now, Crown Prince.

119
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:21,200
What did you pick just now?

120
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,500
"Magu* Gives Her Birthday Greetings"
(*female deity linked to longevity)

121
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:25,100
That's the one. Continue singing this show.

122
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,574
Yes.

123
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,900
Tenth Brother,

124
00:07:29,524 --> 00:07:32,000
shouldn't you drink a few cups with the Crown Prince?

125
00:07:32,868 --> 00:07:33,533
This.

126
00:07:34,354 --> 00:07:35,333
Crown Prince was late,

127
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:37,367
so he should drink 3 cups as punishment.

128
00:07:37,367 --> 00:07:39,933
Yes, correct.
13th brother, help me accompany Crown Prince for a while. I need to change.

129
00:07:39,933 --> 00:07:41,100
I'll be right back!

130
00:07:42,067 --> 00:07:43,767
Come, drink.

131
00:07:47,067 --> 00:07:48,933
Qiaohui, come here.

132
00:07:49,667 --> 00:07:50,767
Have you gotten it prepared?

133
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,100
Don't worry.

134
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,633
Your capacity for liquor is great, again.

135
00:08:06,167 --> 00:08:07,100
You're puking?

136
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:13,100
Hey!

137
00:08:13,667 --> 00:08:15,033
Did anyone see?

138
00:08:15,314 --> 00:08:17,967
No. You're already like this and you still want to save face?

139
00:08:17,967 --> 00:08:19,633
You can kill a soldier, but you can't humiliate him.

140
00:08:23,255 --> 00:08:25,133
If they see me puking all over,

141
00:08:25,133 --> 00:08:26,700
where can I hide my face?

142
00:08:28,921 --> 00:08:30,167
You followed me all the way here.

143
00:08:30,167 --> 00:08:31,367
Is it because you want to see me make a fool of myself?

144
00:08:31,667 --> 00:08:32,700
Is that what you think?

145
00:08:33,433 --> 00:08:36,033
Initially, I was going to treat you better since it was your birthday.

146
00:08:36,033 --> 00:08:37,033
I...

147
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,332
It was just talk only.

148
00:08:48,332 --> 00:08:49,067
Don't be angry anymore.

149
00:08:50,133 --> 00:08:52,800
Seeing that it's your birthday, I'll forgive you.

150
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,533
I am here to give you your birthday present.

151
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:56,000
Birthday present?

152
00:08:58,937 --> 00:08:59,733
Just this?

153
00:09:00,667 --> 00:09:02,467
Close your eyes and follow me.

154
00:09:03,367 --> 00:09:04,500
Then if I don't close my eyes?

155
00:09:04,933 --> 00:09:06,300
Then there won't be a present.

156
00:09:06,433 --> 00:09:08,067
I'll close.

157
00:09:08,733 --> 00:09:10,267
Close them.

158
00:09:11,867 --> 00:09:12,946
No peeking.

159
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:15,067
I can't see anything!

160
00:09:15,795 --> 00:09:17,733
I'll be leading you.

161
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,867
Come, Little Red Riding Hood. Follow Grandma.

162
00:09:20,867 --> 00:09:22,567
- You won't harm me, will you?
- Step. Step.

163
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:25,500
Why would I harm you?

164
00:09:25,667 --> 00:09:27,267
Otherwise, you'll take care of me for the rest of my life.

165
00:09:29,595 --> 00:09:30,833
No peeking.

166
00:09:32,167 --> 00:09:33,200
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

167
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,533
Don't talk so fast.

168
00:09:34,667 --> 00:09:36,400
- Walk slower!
- 7 more steps.

169
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,200
Count them on your own.

170
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:42,433
1, 2, 3, 4, 5 , 6, 7.

171
00:09:43,736 --> 00:09:45,686
Are you trying to kill me?

172
00:09:47,267 --> 00:09:49,033
Are we there yet?

173
00:09:49,933 --> 00:09:51,633
- Say something.
- Time to go down.

174
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:53,967
Are we there yet or not?

175
00:09:53,967 --> 00:09:55,600
If you don't say anything, I'll open my eyes.

176
00:09:56,033 --> 00:09:56,967
Still won't talk?

177
00:09:56,967 --> 00:10:00,222
This is so bothersome! Honestly! I'm so tired!

178
00:10:01,778 --> 00:10:02,767
Turn right!

179
00:10:04,233 --> 00:10:05,500
Go!

180
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,867
Stop!

181
00:10:14,533 --> 00:10:15,967
Scared me to death!

182
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,400
Open your eyes.

183
00:10:30,867 --> 00:10:32,855
So beautiful!

184
00:10:38,349 --> 00:10:39,500
Too beautiful.

185
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:42,167
Ruoxi,

186
00:10:42,167 --> 00:10:43,800
did you make all these yourself?

187
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,033
Of course!

188
00:10:45,033 --> 00:10:46,767
Ruoxi, what are these?

189
00:10:46,767 --> 00:10:47,933
A thousand origami cranes.

190
00:10:47,933 --> 00:10:49,333
Thousand origami cranes?

191
00:10:50,014 --> 00:10:52,000
What are a thousand paper cranes for?

192
00:10:54,649 --> 00:10:55,567
This is so much fun!

193
00:10:55,567 --> 00:10:57,800
Happy Birthday to you.

194
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,200
Happy Birthday to you.

195
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,658
Happy Birthday to you.

196
00:11:05,658 --> 00:11:09,233
Happy Birthday to you.

197
00:11:09,233 --> 00:11:10,333
Ruoxi,

198
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:12,200
what are you singing?

199
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:12,967
Birthday song.

200
00:11:12,967 --> 00:11:13,767
Birthday song?

201
00:11:13,767 --> 00:11:15,487
Birthday song can be sung like this?

202
00:11:15,487 --> 00:11:17,467
Isn't the birthday song "Magu Giving Her Birthday Greetings"?

203
00:11:17,467 --> 00:11:19,400
This is the version I made up.

204
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,027
Maertai version.

205
00:11:21,531 --> 00:11:22,833
Ruoxi, it sounds great.

206
00:11:22,833 --> 00:11:23,833
Sing it for me another time, will you?

207
00:11:23,833 --> 00:11:26,400
When will you sing me one as well?

208
00:11:28,156 --> 00:11:29,100
Greetings to the two princes.

209
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,133
Tenth Brother.

210
00:11:30,133 --> 00:11:32,967
I was wondering why you disappeared halfway through drinking.

211
00:11:33,167 --> 00:11:35,867
So there was a little show going on here.

212
00:11:35,867 --> 00:11:37,067
I was getting a little drunk just now,

213
00:11:37,067 --> 00:11:38,535
so I came here to sit for a while.

214
00:11:38,535 --> 00:11:41,600
I think you're drunk with happiness.

215
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,529
Fourteenth Brother!

216
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,967
Tenth Brother's anxious.

217
00:11:44,967 --> 00:11:46,033
Tenth Brother is unhappy.

218
00:11:46,033 --> 00:11:47,933
Then let's not bother them.

219
00:11:47,933 --> 00:11:50,000
Let's enjoy the scenery here.

220
00:11:51,233 --> 00:11:52,267
This folding screen is really nice.

221
00:11:52,267 --> 00:11:53,433
There's so much beautiful scenery nearby.

222
00:11:53,433 --> 00:11:55,267
Why must you come here to admire?!

223
00:11:55,267 --> 00:11:57,800
Dear princes, take your time to admire. I'll take my leave first.

224
00:12:00,015 --> 00:12:01,000
I'll take my leave first.

225
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,500
Ruoxi...

226
00:12:03,267 --> 00:12:04,767
Don't be so anxious.

227
00:12:11,867 --> 00:12:14,400
Don't you have eyes? Walking into people?

228
00:12:17,011 --> 00:12:19,267
You were raised by your parents,

229
00:12:19,267 --> 00:12:20,867
but you don't have any manners.

230
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,833
Is this considered as pot calling the kettle black?

231
00:12:24,566 --> 00:12:26,067
You are you, and I am me.

232
00:12:26,067 --> 00:12:30,167
I have parents to teach me. You can't compare to me.

233
00:12:33,567 --> 00:12:34,667
What do you want again?

234
00:12:34,667 --> 00:12:36,633
Anyway, you and your sister are the same.

235
00:12:36,633 --> 00:12:39,700
Both of you are cheap wenches that don't know the rules.

236
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,100
Where did you hear this from?

237
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,967
Who I heard it from isn't important.

238
00:12:44,367 --> 00:12:45,767
Anyway,

239
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:49,567
both of you are cheap wenches, venomous women.

240
00:12:52,167 --> 00:12:53,400
You dare hit me?

241
00:12:56,252 --> 00:12:58,900
Who allowed you to hit me? I'll hit you!

242
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:02,033
Cheap wench! Cheap wench!

243
00:13:02,467 --> 00:13:04,433
Who allowed you to hit me! You cheap wench!

244
00:13:04,433 --> 00:13:06,133
I'll hit you! I'll hit!

245
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,000
- I'll hit you!
- Stop!

246
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:13,767
- I'll hit you!
- Stop!

247
00:13:13,767 --> 00:13:14,600
You venomous woman!

248
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,967
You cheap wench!

249
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,533
Stop fighting! Stop!

250
00:13:17,533 --> 00:13:18,867
Stop! Stop!

251
00:13:22,133 --> 00:13:23,100
Stop!

252
00:13:24,666 --> 00:13:25,567
Quick, stop them!

253
00:13:28,575 --> 00:13:30,367
- Ruoxi!
- Ruoxi!

254
00:13:30,567 --> 00:13:32,233
Lady! What happened?

255
00:13:32,233 --> 00:13:32,800
Quickly, save them!

256
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,898
- Quickly, save them!
- Help!

257
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:38,467
- Quick! Bring them back up.
- Ruoxi!

258
00:13:38,467 --> 00:13:39,300
Quick! Save them!

259
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:42,400
Come! Be careful! Ruoxi!

260
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,633
Quick!

261
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,167
Ruoxi!

262
00:13:45,167 --> 00:13:46,200
What happened?

263
00:13:47,933 --> 00:13:49,367
Ruoxi, are you all right?

264
00:13:49,367 --> 00:13:50,355
Are you all right?

265
00:13:51,233 --> 00:13:52,600
Lady, are you all right?

266
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:55,556
Are you all right? Slowly, Lady.

267
00:13:56,967 --> 00:13:58,767
Mingyu, are you all right?

268
00:14:00,767 --> 00:14:01,567
Go away!

269
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:03,900
Ruolan, are you all right?

270
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:05,600
- Ruoxi!
- Jiejie!

271
00:14:06,933 --> 00:14:09,000
- Brother-in-law!
- Step down!

272
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,467
See what she's done!

273
00:14:10,467 --> 00:14:11,667
Mingyu!

274
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,600
Shut up!

275
00:14:27,433 --> 00:14:28,933
You still dare cry!

276
00:14:53,233 --> 00:14:57,767
I never thought that our "Go-All-Out Thirteenth Prince" would have such a sister, huh?

277
00:15:00,735 --> 00:15:03,533
All right! It wasn't a big issue that happened.

278
00:15:03,833 --> 00:15:07,100
Let us return to drinking and singing then.

279
00:15:07,167 --> 00:15:08,967
Let's go.

280
00:15:09,967 --> 00:15:11,333
Help Thirteenth and Fourteenth Prince change.

281
00:15:11,533 --> 00:15:13,167
Yes.

282
00:15:13,533 --> 00:15:14,733
Send Lady back.

283
00:15:14,733 --> 00:15:15,933
Yes.

284
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,900
Jiejie...

285
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:45,133
Second Miss.

286
00:15:45,433 --> 00:15:47,800
Second Miss, let's go back.

287
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:02,667
Second Miss, the ginger soup is ready. Drink some to warm up.

288
00:16:06,967 --> 00:16:09,900
Did Jiejie come visit me?

289
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:14,567
Then did she say anything?

290
00:16:19,533 --> 00:16:21,700
This afternoon, was I

291
00:16:21,933 --> 00:16:24,721
very scary?

292
00:16:27,693 --> 00:16:29,333
Jiejie must be angry.

293
00:16:31,167 --> 00:16:34,767
I think... that once she calms down,

294
00:16:34,767 --> 00:16:35,867
everything will be all right.

295
00:16:36,767 --> 00:16:38,367
Don't you agree?

296
00:16:48,067 --> 00:16:49,400
Greetings to Second Miss.

297
00:16:57,663 --> 00:16:59,200
Greetings to Second Miss.

298
00:17:08,485 --> 00:17:09,768
Jiejie!

299
00:17:10,311 --> 00:17:11,618
Greetings to Second Miss.

300
00:17:11,618 --> 00:17:13,390
Morning, Jiejie.

301
00:17:14,901 --> 00:17:16,990
Jiejie, today's weather is pretty good.

302
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:18,477
Want to take a walk outside?

303
00:17:18,477 --> 00:17:19,877
I'll accompany you.

304
00:17:19,877 --> 00:17:23,407
You want to offer incense? Offering incense is good.

305
00:17:23,407 --> 00:17:25,450
Dongyu, pour me a cup of tea.

306
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:26,697
- Yes, Madam.
- No need.

307
00:17:26,697 --> 00:17:28,300
I'll do it. I'll do it.

308
00:17:29,732 --> 00:17:30,713
Stay here.

309
00:17:30,713 --> 00:17:33,104
Dongyu, help me outside, I'm taking a walk.

310
00:17:33,633 --> 00:17:36,310
Jiejie! Jiejie?

311
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:39,607
Jiejie, don't be mad anymore.

312
00:17:39,607 --> 00:17:41,372
Talk to me.

313
00:17:41,372 --> 00:17:44,087
Don't ignore me.

314
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:48,731
Thank you.

315
00:17:51,733 --> 00:17:54,489
- Today's weather is really good.
- Yes.

316
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,137
Ruoxi?

317
00:18:02,733 --> 00:18:05,633
Tenth Prince, Fourteenth Prince, you're here.

318
00:18:05,633 --> 00:18:08,196
What's with this look?

319
00:18:09,236 --> 00:18:12,122
The look of a broken pot being broken of course.

320
00:18:12,122 --> 00:18:13,283
I always thought

321
00:18:13,283 --> 00:18:14,833
you were pretty fierce to me,

322
00:18:14,833 --> 00:18:15,933
but now it seems

323
00:18:15,933 --> 00:18:18,413
that you treat me pretty good, don't you?

324
00:18:18,803 --> 00:18:20,300
When I first saw her,

325
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:22,500
I thought she was a mesmerizing beauty.

326
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,667
Pity.

327
00:18:26,367 --> 00:18:28,400
What do you mean by that.

328
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:29,867
Did you know

329
00:18:29,867 --> 00:18:32,233
you‘ve become famous with this one battle.

330
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,200
You mean, what happened at the birthday celebration,

331
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,933
has already spread out?

332
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,133
I guessed it.

333
00:18:38,133 --> 00:18:39,533
Good news doesn't leave the house,

334
00:18:39,533 --> 00:18:42,067
but bad news will spread for thousands of miles.

335
00:18:42,067 --> 00:18:44,100
Because of being implicated by you,

336
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,400
Thirteenth Brother's been very busy.

337
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,500
Me? What does that have to do with me?

338
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,133
Currently, all the princes,

339
00:18:49,133 --> 00:18:50,467
once they see Thirteenth Brother,

340
00:18:50,467 --> 00:18:51,200
they ask

341
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,633
"How did you suddenly gain an extra sister?"

342
00:18:52,633 --> 00:18:54,000
All the young lords and princes in the Forbidden City

343
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,567
are talking about you.

344
00:18:55,567 --> 00:18:58,000
- Go-All-Out Thirteenth Sister!
- Go-All-Out Thirteenth Sister!

345
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,267
My god!

346
00:18:59,267 --> 00:19:00,699
No way!

347
00:19:00,699 --> 00:19:01,467
It is!

348
00:19:01,467 --> 00:19:02,933
Second Miss, Second Miss!

349
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:03,833
I've finally found you!

350
00:19:03,833 --> 00:19:05,067
Greetings to Tenth Prince, Fourteenth Prince,

351
00:19:05,067 --> 00:19:06,500
and Second Miss.

352
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,567
Rise.

353
00:19:07,567 --> 00:19:09,300
Second Miss. Bei'le wants to see you.

354
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:11,067
He's waiting in the study room.

355
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,633
Eighth Prince wants to see me?

356
00:19:14,633 --> 00:19:15,600
You may take your leave first.

357
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,933
Yes.

358
00:19:19,967 --> 00:19:21,767
What? Scared now?

359
00:19:21,767 --> 00:19:24,133
Tenth Brother, don't tease her anymore.

360
00:19:24,133 --> 00:19:27,200
Ruoxi, I was just joking.

361
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:30,200
I'm not afraid of being punished by Eighth Prince.

362
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,600
Regarding this matter,

363
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,000
some of the fault lies with me too.

364
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,767
I'm just worried that I'll implicate Jiejie.

365
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:37,233
Don't be scared.

366
00:19:37,233 --> 00:19:39,867
We'll both plead for leniency on your behalf.

367
00:19:42,367 --> 00:19:44,067
Loyal friends indeed!

368
00:19:44,533 --> 00:19:45,867
Regarding the matter this morning,

369
00:19:45,867 --> 00:19:47,133
in which the Vice Minister

370
00:19:47,133 --> 00:19:48,733
was accused of offering amnesty to and recruiting the Guangdong pirate,

371
00:19:48,733 --> 00:19:51,367
A'Baowei, what's your opinion?

372
00:19:51,367 --> 00:19:52,600
What opinion can we have?

373
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,133
Regarding those pirates who terrorize the seas,

374
00:19:54,133 --> 00:19:56,500
how can we be soft on them? If we don't make an example of him,

375
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,400
then I'm afraid that the rest of the pirates

376
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,767
will only become even more brazen.

377
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:02,767
Fourteenth Brother, what do you think?

378
00:20:04,167 --> 00:20:06,300
Even though Imperial Father didn't say anything,

379
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:08,000
but according to my guess,

380
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,200
Imperial Father has most likely come to a decison already.

381
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,733
I'm afraid Imperial Father agrees with

382
00:20:11,733 --> 00:20:13,767
what the Vice Minister is doing.

383
00:20:13,767 --> 00:20:14,867
Is that so?

384
00:20:14,867 --> 00:20:16,667
Among these two hundred and thirty-seven pirates,

385
00:20:16,667 --> 00:20:18,600
every one of them is a courageous fierce fighter,

386
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,733
and they are extremely familiar with the surrounding waters.

387
00:20:20,733 --> 00:20:22,233
Every one of them is a true soldier.

388
00:20:22,233 --> 00:20:24,200
If we are able to enlist them as our own soldiers,

389
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:27,014
not only will we be able to increase our naval strength,

390
00:20:27,014 --> 00:20:29,600
it will also showcase the might of our great Qing.

391
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,100
Eighth Brother, you should know as well,

392
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:32,500
that any person who is capable

393
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,900
and willing to serve the country,

394
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:36,267
Imperial Father will definitely give them a chance.

395
00:20:36,767 --> 00:20:38,501
Then let's submit a report

396
00:20:38,501 --> 00:20:40,700
to plead for leniency on behalf of the Vice Minister.

397
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,800
Come in.

398
00:20:52,767 --> 00:20:55,733
Master, the sky is getting dark.

399
00:20:55,733 --> 00:20:57,900
Do I need to prepare the food?

400
00:20:59,433 --> 00:21:00,767
I was so focused on the discussion,

401
00:21:00,767 --> 00:21:02,100
I actually forgot about the time.

402
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,609
Turns out, it's already so late.

403
00:21:03,609 --> 00:21:05,233
If you two leave now, it's going to be a hassle.

404
00:21:05,233 --> 00:21:06,333
If there's nothing important,

405
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:07,400
then eat here.

406
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,967
- Sure!
- Sure!

407
00:21:08,967 --> 00:21:09,818
Prepare the food.

408
00:21:09,818 --> 00:21:11,000
Yes.

409
00:21:14,267 --> 00:21:15,967
Tenth Brother, Fourteenth Brother.

410
00:21:15,967 --> 00:21:18,933
Go ahead, I'll follow after in a while.

411
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:22,333
Eighth Brother, why don't we all go together?

412
00:21:22,333 --> 00:21:24,200
Go first.

413
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:39,933
Lift up your head.

414
00:21:56,733 --> 00:21:58,500
Where did the boldness you had the other day

415
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,300
disappear to?

416
00:22:05,633 --> 00:22:07,600
You still want to continue standing?

417
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,400
Go back.

418
00:22:11,467 --> 00:22:13,767
Send Second Miss back to Madam's place.

419
00:22:27,633 --> 00:22:29,000
This Eighth Prince.

420
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,933
What is the meaning of this?

421
00:22:30,933 --> 00:22:32,500
Is this the end of the matter?

422
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:35,667
Or is everything just coming to a temporary close?

423
00:22:35,667 --> 00:22:38,967
Greetings to Tenth Prince. Greetings to Fourteenth Prince.

424
00:22:41,567 --> 00:22:44,933
Ruoxi, how are you?

425
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:54,833
What's wrong?

426
00:22:59,367 --> 00:23:01,267
I'll take you to find Eighth Brother.

427
00:23:09,767 --> 00:23:11,400
Why are you guys laughing?

428
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:18,067
To think I actually worried about you for nothing.

429
00:23:18,933 --> 00:23:20,567
Sorry, sorry!

430
00:23:20,567 --> 00:23:21,900
I won't do it again.

431
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,367
Forgive me this once?

432
00:23:23,367 --> 00:23:24,867
Enough, Tenth Brother.

433
00:23:24,867 --> 00:23:27,200
I am at fault too. It's my fault.

434
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,867
You still have the cheek to say it?

435
00:23:28,867 --> 00:23:30,467
Who was the one that said he would plead for leniency on my behalf?

436
00:23:30,467 --> 00:23:31,800
Listen to me explain.

437
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,100
Our Eighth Brother

438
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:35,267
is famous for being a gentleman.

439
00:23:35,267 --> 00:23:36,933
In all his interactions with others,

440
00:23:36,933 --> 00:23:39,067
he is unfailingly graceful and kind.

441
00:23:39,067 --> 00:23:40,467
If he'd treated you politely

442
00:23:40,467 --> 00:23:41,800
when you entered,

443
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,133
as if everything was normal,

444
00:23:43,133 --> 00:23:44,600
then I'd have to think

445
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:46,600
of how I should go about pleading for leniency on your behalf.

446
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:47,600
But later, I saw that you

447
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,967
were made to stand for such a long time,

448
00:23:48,967 --> 00:23:49,767
I then thought to myself,

449
00:23:49,767 --> 00:23:52,733
"It's done!". I didn't have to plead for leniency on your behalf anymore.

450
00:23:52,733 --> 00:23:54,300
Was that so?

451
00:23:54,767 --> 00:23:56,400
Then why didn't you warn me about this?

452
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,767
'Cause I was waiting to watch a show, of course!

453
00:23:57,767 --> 00:23:58,700
You...!

454
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:00,733
Fourteenth, you're good!

455
00:24:00,733 --> 00:24:01,733
I will remember this.

456
00:24:01,733 --> 00:24:03,967
Enough, now that you've seen her

457
00:24:03,967 --> 00:24:06,400
and your heart's at ease, it's time to eat.

458
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,900
Otherwise, Eighth Brother might really get angry this time!

459
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:09,400
Enough. I'm hungry, too.

460
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:12,033
I'm going to eat, too. You should go, too.

461
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:17,267
What is the reaction from the Guoluoluo House?

462
00:24:17,267 --> 00:24:19,600
At this point, this matter can be considered to have come to a close.

463
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:20,567
You needn't worry about it anymore.

464
00:24:20,567 --> 00:24:21,567
All these matters,

465
00:24:21,567 --> 00:24:23,300
Eighth Brother will handle it.

466
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:24,533
You should hurry back.

467
00:24:24,533 --> 00:24:27,000
Ask the maids to help massage your legs.

468
00:24:29,633 --> 00:24:30,700
Are your legs all right?

469
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:32,667
- Is it serious?
- Let's go!

470
00:24:32,733 --> 00:24:34,767
Fourteenth Brother, what are you doing?

471
00:24:34,767 --> 00:24:37,000
All right! This--

472
00:24:52,867 --> 00:24:55,133
Jiejie, I'm back.

473
00:24:55,133 --> 00:24:56,833
Second Miss.

474
00:24:59,333 --> 00:25:00,533
Qiaohui,

475
00:25:00,767 --> 00:25:02,700
instruct the kitchen staff to heat the dishes,

476
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:04,267
and send them over for Second Miss to eat.

477
00:25:04,267 --> 00:25:05,967
Yes, Madam.

478
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:10,167
Greetings to Fujin.

479
00:25:10,167 --> 00:25:11,433
What's the matter?

480
00:25:11,433 --> 00:25:12,933
Bei lao ye instructed me

481
00:25:12,933 --> 00:25:15,699
to send food to Second miss

482
00:25:17,833 --> 00:25:20,067
Your servant will take his leave.

483
00:25:20,067 --> 00:25:21,633
Madam, then do we still have to

484
00:25:21,633 --> 00:25:23,633
heat our dishes?

485
00:25:23,933 --> 00:25:25,767
Since there is food that has been prepared,

486
00:25:25,767 --> 00:25:26,800
then there's no need to heat the food.

487
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,300
Yes.

488
00:25:29,633 --> 00:25:32,567
Once she is done eating, help her wash up.

489
00:25:32,567 --> 00:25:34,233
Sleep early.

490
00:25:34,233 --> 00:25:35,833
Jiejie.

491
00:25:43,733 --> 00:25:47,233
Looks like Jiejie is still angry.

492
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:52,833
Second Miss, eat it while it's still warm.

493
00:25:53,567 --> 00:25:55,233
Scaredy cat.

494
00:26:03,067 --> 00:26:03,867
You've all come.

495
00:26:03,867 --> 00:26:04,833
Eighth Brother.

496
00:26:04,833 --> 00:26:05,567
Sit.

497
00:26:05,567 --> 00:26:06,967
Yes.

498
00:26:09,333 --> 00:26:10,767
Greetings to Eighth Prince.

499
00:26:10,767 --> 00:26:12,267
You should also come and sit.

500
00:26:12,267 --> 00:26:13,767
Eighth Prince.

501
00:26:14,467 --> 00:26:16,433
I only have a few words to say and will leave once I'm done saying them.

502
00:26:16,433 --> 00:26:18,033
Standing here is fine.

503
00:26:18,733 --> 00:26:20,300
I don't have much to say to you either.

504
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:22,100
I'm unable to help you with your matter.

505
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:24,433
Only the person who tied the knot can undo the knot.

506
00:26:25,233 --> 00:26:27,167
Is there still anything you want to say?

507
00:26:27,367 --> 00:26:28,967
No.

508
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:31,133
Then Ruoxi will take her leave now.

509
00:26:31,133 --> 00:26:32,767
Go now.

510
00:26:42,633 --> 00:26:43,633
Sit.

511
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,533
I was not able to get reinforcement troops,

512
00:26:54,533 --> 00:26:57,100
I'll just have to depend on myself then.

513
00:27:02,167 --> 00:27:03,467
Sister.

514
00:27:03,467 --> 00:27:05,233
Second Miss.

515
00:27:06,867 --> 00:27:08,767
Sister!

516
00:27:24,867 --> 00:27:25,833
Tantrums won't work.

517
00:27:25,833 --> 00:27:28,833
Should I use genuine feelings to move her?

518
00:27:37,833 --> 00:27:39,467
Jiejie,

519
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,367
When Mother passed away,

520
00:27:44,367 --> 00:27:46,800
I was still a newborn.

521
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:49,600
From the time I was young till now, all I remember

522
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:52,467
is Father saying that I was a havoc machine.

523
00:27:52,467 --> 00:27:56,267
His concubines hated how stubborn and naughty I was.

524
00:27:56,267 --> 00:27:58,367
As for our other siblings,

525
00:27:58,367 --> 00:28:01,433
although they had their good points,

526
00:28:01,433 --> 00:28:05,367
but after all, we don't share the same mother.

527
00:28:10,567 --> 00:28:12,600
Only you.

528
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:15,200
The both of us were birthed by the same mother.

529
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:18,867
Only Jiejie has never stopped caring or given up on me.

530
00:28:23,133 --> 00:28:26,367
Ever since I fell from the second storey,

531
00:28:26,367 --> 00:28:28,767
Jiejie's care,

532
00:28:28,767 --> 00:28:31,700
patience, and forbearance for me,

533
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:34,733
I feel it all deeply.

534
00:28:34,733 --> 00:28:37,133
If I do anything wrong,

535
00:28:37,133 --> 00:28:40,033
Jiejie can beat me or scold me,

536
00:28:40,033 --> 00:28:42,776
I will listen to you.

537
00:28:42,776 --> 00:28:47,002
But if Jiejie were to ignore me,

538
00:28:47,002 --> 00:28:48,633
I...

539
00:28:49,433 --> 00:28:52,833
I only have Jiejie as my only family left.

540
00:28:59,167 --> 00:29:00,700
Ruoxi.

541
00:29:02,367 --> 00:29:05,767
Sister, don't be angry with me anymore.

542
00:29:05,767 --> 00:29:08,000
I only have you.

543
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,867
I know I'm wrong. It's my fault.

544
00:29:11,867 --> 00:29:14,633
I've already learned my lesson.

545
00:29:17,333 --> 00:29:18,833
Madam,

546
00:29:18,833 --> 00:29:22,367
Second miss knows she's wrong.

547
00:29:22,367 --> 00:29:24,767
You should forgive her.

548
00:29:27,867 --> 00:29:31,933
Rou xi, Jiejie is at fault too.

549
00:29:31,933 --> 00:29:34,367
Being angry with you for so long,

550
00:29:35,133 --> 00:29:38,633
I've caused you to suffer and be hurt.

551
00:29:38,633 --> 00:29:41,267
Madam. Second Miss.

552
00:29:41,267 --> 00:29:43,433
Don't cry.

553
00:29:48,467 --> 00:29:50,033
Ruoxi,

554
00:29:50,767 --> 00:29:53,333
From now on

555
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:54,433
you need to change

556
00:29:54,433 --> 00:29:57,167
this fiery, unyielding temper of yours;

557
00:29:57,367 --> 00:29:58,600
otherwise,

558
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:01,167
you might easily get yourself killed.

559
00:30:01,167 --> 00:30:04,800
Do you think that Guoluoluo Family's Lady Mingyu is easy to pick on?

560
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:08,067
If Bei'le had not taken the responsibility of this onto himself,

561
00:30:08,067 --> 00:30:10,900
Difujin and the those from the Prince Consort's Estate

562
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:14,033
wouldn't have let you off.

563
00:30:14,933 --> 00:30:19,167
Jiejie, I was rash and reckless.

564
00:30:19,167 --> 00:30:22,767
I attempted to be tougher than I was and didn't know my place.

565
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,300
I've learned my lesson.

566
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:28,100
I really have learned my lesson.

567
00:30:46,669 --> 00:30:48,334
Second Miss becareful.

568
00:30:48,334 --> 00:30:49,100
Second Miss.

569
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:50,345
Be careful. Don't go up there.

570
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:52,504
Second Miss, it's dangerous up there.

571
00:30:52,504 --> 00:30:53,572
Be careful.

572
00:30:53,572 --> 00:30:55,033
Yes, Second Miss. Do it slowly.

573
00:30:55,133 --> 00:30:56,266
It's dangerous, Second Miss.

574
00:30:56,266 --> 00:30:57,288
Be careful, Second Miss.

575
00:30:57,288 --> 00:30:58,202
Quickly come back down, Second Miss.

576
00:30:58,202 --> 00:30:59,733
Don't be so noisy!

577
00:31:00,846 --> 00:31:02,167
You'll have to be more careful then, Second Miss.

578
00:31:02,167 --> 00:31:03,800
Second Miss, slow down a bit.

579
00:31:04,233 --> 00:31:05,415
Be careful.

580
00:31:08,367 --> 00:31:10,732
Second Miss! Be careful. Second Miss.

581
00:31:11,333 --> 00:31:12,009
Second Miss!

582
00:31:13,217 --> 00:31:14,842
Somebody help! Second Miss!

583
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,554
- Second Miss!
- Ruoxi!

584
00:31:20,654 --> 00:31:24,433
- Second Miss!
- Second Miss!

585
00:31:24,571 --> 00:31:29,133
Be careful, Second Miss. Hurry and come down. Don't hang it up anymore.

586
00:31:29,133 --> 00:31:31,633
Come down quickly, Second Miss.

587
00:31:33,667 --> 00:31:34,933
Ruoxi!

588
00:31:34,933 --> 00:31:36,901
Come down right now!

589
00:31:36,901 --> 00:31:38,667
Second Miss. Slowly. Slowly.

590
00:31:38,667 --> 00:31:39,873
Be careful.

591
00:31:40,167 --> 00:31:41,233
Jiejie!

592
00:31:41,767 --> 00:31:43,200
You were just acting sensible,

593
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,667
and now you're acting like a monkey.

594
00:31:44,667 --> 00:31:46,050
Are you rebelling?

595
00:31:47,167 --> 00:31:48,067
Look at you.

596
00:31:48,067 --> 00:31:49,967
How am I not to worry and let you enter the palace?

597
00:31:50,233 --> 00:31:52,467
They are starting to select the maidens? So early?

598
00:31:52,467 --> 00:31:54,687
If there's going to be a selection, are you qualified enough?

599
00:31:56,638 --> 00:31:57,938
Not yet

600
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,167
The Emperor has decided to hold the Mid-Autumn Festival Banquet in the palace.

601
00:32:02,929 --> 00:32:05,500
All the princes will be bringing their families in with them.

602
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:06,700
The Emperor said

603
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,167
you have to come, too.

604
00:32:10,616 --> 00:32:13,900
Me? The Emperor knows me?

605
00:32:20,267 --> 00:32:24,300
I really did become famous with that one battle.

606
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:26,433
Can I not go?

607
00:32:26,433 --> 00:32:27,967
It's an imperial edict.

608
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:30,233
It's not up to you to decide.

609
00:32:37,767 --> 00:32:41,867
Walk without looking back.

610
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:46,567
Smile without showing teeth.

611
00:32:47,833 --> 00:32:53,400
Walk smooth and steady.

612
00:32:55,167 --> 00:32:59,300
Not allowed to look around.

613
00:32:59,967 --> 00:33:04,200
Not allowed to look left and right.

614
00:33:04,433 --> 00:33:12,333
Speak, smile and behave with elegant grace.

615
00:33:17,933 --> 00:33:18,953
Jiejie,

616
00:33:20,033 --> 00:33:22,189
I can't do it.

617
00:33:22,189 --> 00:33:23,800
I really can't do it anymore.

618
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,300
If you're tired, take a rest then.

619
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:58,767
The palace rules

620
00:33:58,767 --> 00:34:00,967
about where to change clothes, where to sit,

621
00:34:00,967 --> 00:34:02,933
where to pay respects, when to start the banquet,

622
00:34:02,933 --> 00:34:04,233
and when to leave the banquet.

623
00:34:04,649 --> 00:34:05,667
Have you remembered them all?

624
00:34:06,167 --> 00:34:06,900
Yes, I have!

625
00:34:10,733 --> 00:34:11,967
This way! Right?

626
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:14,192
It's the other side.

627
00:34:19,732 --> 00:34:20,667
Get up.

628
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:26,400
Whichever works.

629
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:43,467
The Emperor has arrived!

630
00:35:09,833 --> 00:35:11,967
All rise!

631
00:35:15,833 --> 00:35:17,267
The Mid-Autumn Festival

632
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,333
is a time of celebration for all levels of society.

633
00:35:21,333 --> 00:35:22,867
Dispense with the formalities.

634
00:35:22,867 --> 00:35:23,933
Yes.

635
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:31,800
You.

636
00:35:47,367 --> 00:35:48,267
Go

637
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:05,867
Your servant, Maertai Ruoxi, greets Your Majesty.

638
00:36:06,485 --> 00:36:08,933
You are the one they are calling "Go-All-Out Thirteenth Sister,"

639
00:36:09,457 --> 00:36:10,967
Maertai Ruoxi?

640
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:16,733
Replying Your Majesty, yes, I am.

641
00:36:17,369 --> 00:36:18,633
Rise to answer.

642
00:36:19,567 --> 00:36:20,733
Thank you, Your Majesty.

643
00:36:27,633 --> 00:36:30,733
Seeing me makes you nervous?

644
00:36:32,167 --> 00:36:33,000
Yes

645
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,372
Why?

646
00:36:37,333 --> 00:36:39,000
It's my first time seeing the "Son of Heaven"*,
(*Emperors are Sons of Heaven, hence the mandate to rule)

647
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,500
and I feel that you're extremely awe-inspiring,

648
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:42,033
that's why I'm nervous.

649
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:46,184
You think I'm awe-inspiring? You're scared of me?

650
00:36:46,184 --> 00:36:48,691
Only a despot would want everyone to fear him.

651
00:36:48,691 --> 00:36:51,810
Since ancient times, good Emperors want the respect and love of the people.

652
00:36:52,089 --> 00:36:56,267
No! Your Majesty is a wise ruler, why would I be scared?

653
00:36:56,267 --> 00:36:58,467
It's just that it's my first time in the palace.

654
00:36:58,467 --> 00:37:00,233
I feel that the palace is very awe-inspiring,

655
00:37:00,233 --> 00:37:02,067
so I'm feeling a little nervous.

656
00:37:02,067 --> 00:37:04,167
A wise ruler?

657
00:37:05,463 --> 00:37:07,133
Look at me.

658
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:15,448
Why do you think I'm a wise ruler?

659
00:37:26,133 --> 00:37:27,400
Answer me!

660
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,267
He ascended the throne when he was eight and defeated Ao Bai.

661
00:37:29,267 --> 00:37:31,967
He quelled the Revolt of the Three Feudalities and the Dzungar uprising.

662
00:37:31,967 --> 00:37:34,133
No, I can't say those things.

663
00:37:34,133 --> 00:37:36,367
Those are his own self-assessments made in his latter years.

664
00:37:36,367 --> 00:37:39,333
But if I don't speak about his governing achievements, what else can I say?

665
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:51,300
Chin Shih-huang and Han Wu-ti
were lacking in literary grace

666
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:54,333
Emperor Taizong of Tang and Emperor Taizu of Song were slightly lacking in governing accolades.

667
00:37:55,270 --> 00:37:57,755
The Great Son of Heaven, Genghis Khan

668
00:37:57,755 --> 00:38:00,333
only knew how to cock bows and shoot condors.

669
00:38:00,833 --> 00:38:03,500
They are all past and gone. If you want to count who are the outstanding and accomplished men,

670
00:38:04,167 --> 00:38:05,967
look to this age alone.
(an excerpt of a poem by Mao Zedong)

671
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:07,900
Is this your answer?

672
00:38:17,433 --> 00:38:19,233
This "Go-All-Out Thirteenth Sister"

673
00:38:19,233 --> 00:38:21,694
is not what they say her to be.

674
00:38:22,667 --> 00:38:23,933
Thirteenth Prince,

675
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:27,433
the way I see it, this Thirteenth Sister is no match for you.

676
00:38:27,433 --> 00:38:29,367
It's only a false reputation.

677
00:38:32,933 --> 00:38:34,367
Replying to Imperial Father.

678
00:38:34,867 --> 00:38:36,733
Ruoxi was just a newborn calf (that's why she's not afraid of the tiger).

679
00:38:36,733 --> 00:38:38,067
It's just she's intelligent and lovable.

680
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:39,833
If I had such a sister,

681
00:38:39,833 --> 00:38:41,267
I thought I wouldn't lose face.

682
00:38:41,267 --> 00:38:42,967
But now, in the awe-inspiring presence of the Emperor,

683
00:38:42,967 --> 00:38:44,600
she can't even stand up.

684
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:45,633
It's very impolite.

685
00:38:46,067 --> 00:38:49,167
Looks like it's better that I revoke her

686
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:51,625
"Go-All-Out Thirteenth Sister" nickname.

687
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,300
I'm used to hearing people tell me only the good things.

688
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:58,700
Ruoxi's words, on the other hand, are rather fresh.

689
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:00,533
It looks like not only do you know how to

690
00:39:00,533 --> 00:39:03,746
go all out (blindly), but you are also very knowledgeable.

691
00:39:04,071 --> 00:39:04,933
Reward her.

692
00:39:05,233 --> 00:39:06,600
Yes.

693
00:39:13,133 --> 00:39:16,000
Tonight is Mid-Autumn night.

694
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,933
It's a night of reunion.

695
00:39:18,333 --> 00:39:20,998
The sages often say that the world comes before one's country, and one's country comes before family (focus on the big things first).

696
00:39:20,998 --> 00:39:22,467
But to me,

697
00:39:22,467 --> 00:39:24,333
there can be no country without family,

698
00:39:24,333 --> 00:39:26,267
much less the world.

699
00:39:26,267 --> 00:39:29,500
If the Imperial Family isn't at peace,

700
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:31,867
it heralds unrest for the country.

701
00:39:31,867 --> 00:39:34,767
So all of you must remember my words well.

702
00:39:35,533 --> 00:39:36,933
Make sure that it is constantly engraved in your minds

703
00:39:37,567 --> 00:39:40,633
the duties of a ruler and his subjects, and brotherhood amongst yourselves.

704
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,867
Come, accompany me

705
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:45,400
to drink a round of reunion wine.

706
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:47,633
Come.

707
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:59,400
Come, come.

708
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:01,400
Take your seats and relax.

709
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,300
Dispense with the formalities for tonight.

710
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:19,433
Why have you broken out in a cold sweat?

711
00:40:22,438 --> 00:40:24,633
His Majesty was full of praise for you,

712
00:40:25,233 --> 00:40:26,800
and he rewarded you in front of everyone.

713
00:40:27,267 --> 00:40:29,933
You've passed this hurdle.

714
00:40:30,633 --> 00:40:32,633
I know that I have crossed this hurdle too.

715
00:40:33,233 --> 00:40:35,367
But just now, there was such a thin line between life and death.

716
00:40:35,975 --> 00:40:38,467
Even when I think about it now, I'm still scared.

717
00:40:38,901 --> 00:40:40,767
The maiden selections is around the corner.

718
00:40:42,833 --> 00:40:45,000
You will still have to enter the palace in future.

719
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,800
Imperial Father, your son offers his congratulations.

720
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:51,267
Wishing you a prosperous country and a home full of children and grandchildren.

721
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:54,667
Not bad, not bad. Good.

722
00:40:54,667 --> 00:40:55,633
Drink up.

723
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,867
You sure know how to talk.

724
00:41:03,267 --> 00:41:04,400
Imperial Father, all the auspicious sayings

725
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,133
have been said by my brothers.

726
00:41:06,133 --> 00:41:09,167
So I'll just wish Imperial Father a long and healthy life.

727
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:13,200
Look at this.

728
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:15,733
He cannot remember poetry and literature,

729
00:41:15,733 --> 00:41:17,567
he only remembers those common sayings.

730
00:41:24,067 --> 00:41:27,533
Though they are common sayings, they are sincere.

731
00:41:29,667 --> 00:41:31,867
He's already went through his coming of age ceremony, isn't he?

732
00:41:31,867 --> 00:41:33,033
Yes, Your Majesty.

733
00:41:33,033 --> 00:41:36,300
The Ninth Prince already married his Fujin at this age.

734
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:38,833
It's time to pick a Fujin for Tenth Prince too.

735
00:41:40,267 --> 00:41:41,567
He's at that age.

736
00:41:41,567 --> 00:41:45,633
A few days back, Princess Jing just mentioned to me her youngest daughter, Mingyu.

737
00:41:45,633 --> 00:41:48,433
She was asking me to help her find a suitable person.

738
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:50,033
In my opinion,

739
00:41:50,033 --> 00:41:52,900
she's rather compatible with Tenth Prince.

740
00:41:56,595 --> 00:41:58,433
Compatible, compatible.

741
00:41:58,917 --> 00:42:00,567
Imperial Father, I'm still young.

742
00:42:00,567 --> 00:42:01,700
Still young?

743
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,467
You're as tall and strong as a horse, how can you still be young?

744
00:42:06,567 --> 00:42:09,533
Fourth and Eighth Brothers both married a Cefujin first.

745
00:42:09,533 --> 00:42:10,333
Why not

746
00:42:10,333 --> 00:42:12,067
you appoint me a Cefujin first?

747
00:42:12,067 --> 00:42:13,233
Nonsense.

748
00:42:13,522 --> 00:42:15,267
Don't tell me, you think having Lady Mingyu as your Difujin

749
00:42:15,267 --> 00:42:16,933
embarrassing for you?

750
00:42:18,233 --> 00:42:19,433
I deserve death.

751
00:42:19,433 --> 00:42:20,767
What I meant was,

752
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:23,033
I just... Just...

753
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:26,131
What I mean to say is...

754
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:28,433
I was thinking...

755
00:42:30,333 --> 00:42:32,075
I was thinking...

756
00:42:32,567 --> 00:42:33,000
It's just...

757
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,200
Imperial Father,

758
00:42:34,967 --> 00:42:35,533
in my opinion,

759
00:42:35,533 --> 00:42:37,333
Tenth Brother is just finding this a bit abrupt,

760
00:42:37,667 --> 00:42:39,167
and wasn't able to come around to the idea in the heat of the moment.

761
00:42:39,467 --> 00:42:40,933
Once he comes around to the idea,

762
00:42:41,867 --> 00:42:43,733
he'll probably be over the moon.

763
00:42:47,067 --> 00:42:50,372
Tenth Brother, shouldn't you hurry and thank Imperial Father for the favour?

764
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:16,933
Your son thanks Imperial Father.

765
00:43:29,646 --> 00:43:32,500
Mingyu, shouldn't you hurry and thank His Majesty for the favour?

766
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:28,067
Guoluoluo Mingyu

767
00:44:28,067 --> 00:44:29,567
thanks Your Majesty.

768
00:44:30,767 --> 00:44:32,367
Rise.

769
00:44:32,467 --> 00:44:33,867
- Thank you, Your Majesty.
- Thank you, Father.

770
00:44:34,233 --> 00:44:37,900
Your Majesty, look at how compatible they are.

771
00:44:42,867 --> 00:44:44,767
Congratulations, Tenth Brother.

772
00:44:44,767 --> 00:44:46,900
Congratulations, Tenth Brother.

773
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:48,678
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

774
00:44:48,678 --> 00:44:49,633
Congratulations, Tenth Brother.

775
00:44:49,633 --> 00:44:51,733
Thank you, thank you everyone.

776
00:44:51,733 --> 00:44:52,800
Thank you, everyone.

777
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,267
Congratulations.

778
00:44:54,933 --> 00:44:56,500
Congratulations.

779
00:44:56,500 --> 00:44:58,200
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

780
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:02,726
Congratulations.

781
00:45:05,567 --> 00:45:07,067
Why?

782
00:45:07,067 --> 00:45:08,667
Isn't he a prince?

783
00:45:08,667 --> 00:45:10,900
Doesn't he have a most prestigious status?

784
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:12,933
Why did this highly respected status

785
00:45:12,933 --> 00:45:15,133
rob him of his most precious thing?

786
00:45:15,433 --> 00:45:16,533
Freedom...

787
00:45:17,733 --> 00:45:20,867
Could this be the fate of everyone in the Forbidden City?

788
00:45:22,367 --> 00:45:24,437
And who will I be appointed to marry?

789
00:45:24,437 --> 00:45:29,127
A prince? A general? Or...?

790
00:45:49,468 --> 00:45:50,100
Second Miss.

791
00:45:50,733 --> 00:45:51,867
Second Miss.

792
00:45:56,833 --> 00:45:57,533
Ruoxi.

793
00:45:58,036 --> 00:45:59,400
Ruoxi.

794
00:46:00,219 --> 00:46:01,100
What's wrong?

795
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:03,033
Bring her back to her room for now.

796
00:46:16,233 --> 00:46:18,100
Ruoxi is not your average fragile maiden.

797
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:19,800
You don't have to worry too much.

798
00:46:20,067 --> 00:46:21,867
Give her some time.

799
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:25,400
I'll leave first.

800
00:46:25,933 --> 00:46:27,300
I'll send Bei'le off.

801
00:46:44,533 --> 00:46:45,733
Why is it that our fates

802
00:46:45,733 --> 00:46:48,033
can be decided with a single word from the Emperor?

803
00:46:49,033 --> 00:46:50,600
Why have I been brought here?

804
00:46:51,467 --> 00:46:52,533
If I was born in the Qing Dynasty,

805
00:46:52,533 --> 00:46:54,167
I might have been able to resign myself to this fate.

806
00:46:54,667 --> 00:46:57,767
But I've already lived in a modern society for 25 years.

807
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,267
The education I have received​,

808
00:46:59,267 --> 00:47:01,500
taught me that my destiny is in my own hands.

809
00:47:02,467 --> 00:47:04,300
Now I'm suddenly told

810
00:47:04,767 --> 00:47:06,200
that everything is left up to fate.

811
00:47:06,967 --> 00:47:10,400
Resign myself to fate? I will never accept that.
