00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:20,650
♫  In the blink of an eye, a thought of stubborn persistence  ♫

3
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:24,460
♫  We were destined to seek our doom like moths flying towards the flame  ♫

4
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:31,450
♫  Knowing that it’d be a disaster, why am I still at a loss about what to do  ♫

5
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:39,150
♫  The best is not to see, the best is not to miss you  ♫

6
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:44,350
♫  Only like this can I not be in love with you  ♫

7
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:48,810
♫  Just another brushing of the shoulder, and from then...♫

8
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:53,690
♫  I’ll keep falling deeper and deeper in love with you  ♫

9
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:58,240
♫  It’s the mistake of time, ♫

10
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:02,410
♫ forcing us to pass each other by  ♫

11
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:05,410
♫  How I miss you, how far you are  ♫

12
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:08,690
♫  Even though I’d known it’d only result in pain,  ♫

13
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:12,370
♫ at this moment, I still don’t want to escape   ♫

14
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:16,920
♫  Pity these words are too glaring, they hurt the eyes  ♫

15
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:22,000
♫  Two worlds later ♫

16
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:25,430
♫  Don’t want to escape  ♫

17
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:27,900
♫  It’s the mistake of time,  ♫

18
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:30,460
♫  we can only pass each other by  ♫

19
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:35,330
♫  The magnitude of me missing you is as much as how far you are   ♫

20
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:41,920
♫  Even though I know the ending is a mistake that I cannot oppose  ♫

21
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:47,190
♫  Staying in this moment  ♫

22
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:49,500
♫  We can only accept  ♫

23
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:55,900
♫ that the feelings run deep, but fate is shallow  ♫

24
00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:01,680
Scarlet Heart
Episode 29

25
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:12,460
Greetings to the Emperor.

26
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:15,620
- Greetings to the Emperor.
- Greetings to the Emperor.

27
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:17,060
You may excuse yourselves.

28
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:18,580
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

29
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:36,120
Imperial Mother.

30
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:39,480
Imperial Mother.

31
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,920
Look at me.

32
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,660
Look at me as an Emperor.

33
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,720
I will not fall short of Imperial Father's goals

34
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:56,220
and give my best for the Qing Dynasty.

35
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:00,240
You are not my son.

36
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,300
You go out.

37
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:08,260
Get out.

38
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:10,380
Imperial Mother.

39
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:13,920
It's already this point in time.

40
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:19,680
You still won't allow me to bestow your title as Empress Dowager?

41
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:29,040
I... I...

42
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,800
I don't have...

43
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,980
I don't have a mongrel of a son like you.

44
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:43,920
I don't want your titles.

45
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,220
I want you to leave.

46
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:04,040
I am unworthy to face our ancestors.

47
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:07,160
The thing I regret the most is...

48
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,600
It is...

49
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:16,460
Is to raise such an impure son.

50
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:20,240
In my heart,

51
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:24,499
I just have one son.

52
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:33,720
He is the 14th Prince!

53
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,520
You are not my son.

54
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:44,660
You are not my son!

55
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,480
Get out.

56
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,080
Disappear.

57
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,200
Get out...  Get out!

58
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:00,660
You are not my son!

59
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,480
14th Brother.

60
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:01,680
I won't allow you to touch my mother in the slightest.

61
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,600
All of you get out!

62
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,760
It's already the auspicious day to lay her to rest.

63
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:11,240
If you are really filial to Mother,

64
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,820
then you should act with human kindness

65
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:15,700
and let Imperial Mother sleep

66
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,800
and be buried in the Imperial Tombs.

67
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,180
You dare!

68
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,013
You go away!

69
00:08:26,013 --> 00:08:27,360
No one is allowed to touch my mother!

70
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,960
Get out! Out!

71
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,560
She's already left this world.

72
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:45,420
No one is to touch my mother...

73
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:47,259
especially you!

74
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:53,460
You go away. Go away!

75
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,260
Mother!

76
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:04,317
14th Prince, 14th Prince.

77
00:09:04,317 --> 00:09:06,957
Send for the doctor! Hurry and send for the doctor!

78
00:09:06,957 --> 00:09:08,140
Yes, sir.

79
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:09,420
Hurry up and come in.

80
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:10,840
Yes.

81
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,060
Mother and sons.

82
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:16,260
Who is right and who is wrong?

83
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:21,320
It comes to an end where all three are hurt.

84
00:09:52,626 --> 00:09:55,000
What exactly happened?

85
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,444
You don't even worry about your own health.

86
00:09:59,613 --> 00:10:01,640
Getting ill and not taking your medication.

87
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,600
Can your mother rest in peace?

88
00:10:30,442 --> 00:10:32,000
Ruoxi...

89
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:37,200
When Imperial Father died,

90
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,720
you were there.

91
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:41,360
Did Imperial Father really...

92
00:10:42,448 --> 00:10:44,713
give the throne to 4th Prince?

93
00:10:47,299 --> 00:10:50,804
How come you also take the words of confused people as true?

94
00:10:52,013 --> 00:10:54,003
What other people say,

95
00:10:54,003 --> 00:10:56,146
of course, I don't believe

96
00:10:56,618 --> 00:10:59,008
But Mother has told me,

97
00:10:59,008 --> 00:11:01,710
Imperial Father told her himself.

98
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:04,968
The one Imperial Father preferred was me.

99
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,280
14th Prince,

100
00:11:06,963 --> 00:11:08,999
I'm going to say something disrespectful.

101
00:11:09,278 --> 00:11:11,214
How the Queen Mother treated you

102
00:11:11,214 --> 00:11:13,304
and how she was with the Emperor,

103
00:11:13,304 --> 00:11:15,037
you should know.

104
00:11:16,316 --> 00:11:18,670
In her heart, she always hoped it would be you.

105
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:20,688
She might have mistaken the late Emperor's words,

106
00:11:20,688 --> 00:11:22,599
which is probable.

107
00:11:23,428 --> 00:11:26,261
What the former Emperor told your mother,

108
00:11:26,261 --> 00:11:28,080
I really don't know.

109
00:11:28,769 --> 00:11:30,022
I just know that

110
00:11:30,401 --> 00:11:34,759
the former Emperor has given the throne to the present  Emperor

111
00:11:36,701 --> 00:11:38,040
All right.

112
00:11:39,469 --> 00:11:41,370
I believe you.

113
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:50,363
I'll finally put down that worry.

114
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:54,180
He'll be the Emperor

115
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:57,538
and I'll be the nonchalant one.

116
00:12:46,889 --> 00:12:50,276
Since history cannot be changed,

117
00:12:50,276 --> 00:12:51,980
this kind of lie

118
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,823
may be what's best for the Emperor

119
00:12:53,823 --> 00:12:56,370
and the 14th Prince.

120
00:12:56,946 --> 00:13:01,214
Ancestors, De Fei Niang Niang,
(Consort De, Queen Mother)

121
00:13:01,214 --> 00:13:03,483
I hope that you can understand

122
00:13:04,186 --> 00:13:06,444
and forgive me.

123
00:13:06,444 --> 00:13:08,452
Forgive the Emperor too.

124
00:13:12,594 --> 00:13:14,373
Is there anything else you want to report?

125
00:13:14,373 --> 00:13:15,966
Otherwise, the court is adjourned.

126
00:13:15,966 --> 00:13:18,567
Your Majesty, regarding the crowning of Consort De

127
00:13:18,567 --> 00:13:20,735
as Empress Dowager,

128
00:13:20,735 --> 00:13:23,614
should we title her posthumously as the Empress Dowager?

129
00:13:24,204 --> 00:13:25,509
Don't need to.

130
00:13:26,763 --> 00:13:28,978
Just have her title

131
00:13:28,978 --> 00:13:30,650
bestowed as Honorable Little Empress,

132
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:34,187
born Cheng being always warm, giving, and wise, as beautiful as the sky.

133
00:13:34,187 --> 00:13:35,433
Yes.

134
00:13:57,478 --> 00:13:59,118
You should go rest first.

135
00:14:00,582 --> 00:14:02,183
I'll stay with you.

136
00:14:43,997 --> 00:14:46,277
I heard you helped Cheng Huan prepare a birthday gift

137
00:14:46,277 --> 00:14:47,949
for Hong Li.

138
00:14:49,196 --> 00:14:51,843
That little lass talks about everything.

139
00:14:51,843 --> 00:14:53,236
She didn't say it.

140
00:14:54,065 --> 00:14:55,665
Now, every time she sees me

141
00:14:55,665 --> 00:14:57,377
she runs the other way.

142
00:14:58,654 --> 00:15:01,347
I can't believe that the unstoppable and charismatic 13th

143
00:15:01,347 --> 00:15:04,398
stays away from a little girl.

144
00:15:05,947 --> 00:15:07,447
This sort of thing

145
00:15:07,447 --> 00:15:10,048
you can even turn into a joke?

146
00:15:11,276 --> 00:15:13,645
She will understand when she gets older.

147
00:15:13,645 --> 00:15:15,342
So many of us spoil her,

148
00:15:15,342 --> 00:15:17,524
because of your love for her.

149
00:15:19,968 --> 00:15:21,897
So why is it Hong Li?

150
00:15:21,897 --> 00:15:23,694
He'll understand in the future.

151
00:15:24,583 --> 00:15:26,148
And what about me?

152
00:15:29,291 --> 00:15:31,756
You'll understand why in the future too.

153
00:15:33,244 --> 00:15:34,645
Not that again.

154
00:15:34,645 --> 00:15:36,502
Still talking about crazy things.

155
00:15:38,881 --> 00:15:42,229
All right, I take my leave first.

156
00:15:42,229 --> 00:15:44,281
Why don't you stay and eat with us

157
00:15:45,142 --> 00:15:46,171
That's good too.

158
00:15:47,012 --> 00:15:48,291
But,

159
00:15:48,291 --> 00:15:49,673
you're not preparing to again,

160
00:15:49,673 --> 00:15:51,091
whenever the Emperor places some food on your plate,

161
00:15:51,091 --> 00:15:53,406
stand up and say, "Thank you", right?

162
00:15:55,475 --> 00:15:57,329
Ruoxi,

163
00:15:57,329 --> 00:15:58,747
Imperial Brother is now

164
00:15:58,747 --> 00:16:00,512
the Emperor,

165
00:16:00,512 --> 00:16:02,741
it is what I have to do.

166
00:16:03,609 --> 00:16:05,934
What you are saying, I understand,

167
00:16:05,934 --> 00:16:08,335
I'll also stop before going too far.

168
00:16:08,335 --> 00:16:12,129
But after all it has been a course of ten years,

169
00:16:12,129 --> 00:16:14,451
so many things have happened.

170
00:16:14,451 --> 00:16:17,609
We are no longer the 4th and 13th Brothers from the past.

171
00:16:18,637 --> 00:16:20,388
We are now ruler and government official.

172
00:16:21,052 --> 00:16:23,096
Facing these changes,

173
00:16:23,096 --> 00:16:25,078
I have to get used to them slowly.

174
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:27,322
But he does not wish

175
00:16:27,322 --> 00:16:28,965
for you to see him as the Emperor.

176
00:16:28,965 --> 00:16:30,233
I know.

177
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:32,230
But Ruoxi,

178
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:34,824
since this person has risen to that position

179
00:16:34,824 --> 00:16:36,804
it does not matter if he wishes it or not.

180
00:16:36,804 --> 00:16:38,198
He will have to face

181
00:16:38,198 --> 00:16:41,504
the loneliness and respect being at the very top

182
00:16:41,504 --> 00:16:43,422
and that all will bow to.

183
00:16:44,922 --> 00:16:48,631
Slowly, he will get accustomed to it.

184
00:16:48,631 --> 00:16:50,845
In the future, unknowingly,

185
00:16:50,845 --> 00:16:53,953
he will get used to the absolute power that his position grants him

186
00:16:53,953 --> 00:16:55,404
and the absolute dignity.

187
00:16:56,220 --> 00:17:01,116
No, he won't.

188
00:17:01,273 --> 00:17:03,134
There are a lot of things

189
00:17:03,134 --> 00:17:05,202
that are done in the spur of the moment.

190
00:17:06,004 --> 00:17:08,716
Once he says something,

191
00:17:08,716 --> 00:17:10,713
what has been already spoken

192
00:17:10,713 --> 00:17:12,935
can no longer be changed.

193
00:17:16,428 --> 00:17:18,011
Now,

194
00:17:18,011 --> 00:17:20,535
it's you who needs to accept these things.

195
00:17:21,279 --> 00:17:24,220
I will see him not only as my 4th brother,

196
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:26,913
but as the world's Emperor.

197
00:17:26,913 --> 00:17:28,909
I am his subject.

198
00:17:28,909 --> 00:17:31,086
I will hail him as a brother

199
00:17:31,086 --> 00:17:33,716
but more, stay loyal to him as his subject.

200
00:17:33,716 --> 00:17:35,481
Now, your relationship

201
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:38,732
has already gradually changed to this degree.

202
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:41,042
When he learns of this,

203
00:17:41,042 --> 00:17:43,817
he will be very heartbroken.

204
00:17:44,632 --> 00:17:47,475
Royal Brother understands everything,

205
00:17:47,475 --> 00:17:49,706
the one who doesn't understand is you.

206
00:18:20,212 --> 00:18:21,759
13th Prince.

207
00:18:29,702 --> 00:18:30,805
Greetings, 13th Prince.

208
00:18:30,805 --> 00:18:32,024
Rise.

209
00:18:32,724 --> 00:18:34,731
I have to go out now.

210
00:18:34,731 --> 00:18:36,961
If there's anything, we'll talk later when I return.

211
00:18:36,961 --> 00:18:38,175
13th Prince.

212
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:40,901
Did something happen?

213
00:18:43,594 --> 00:18:44,948
Some affairs.

214
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:47,310
The more you know, the more trouble for you.

215
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:49,089
It's better if you do not know.

216
00:18:53,104 --> 00:18:57,169
Today, Imperial Brother yelled at 8th Brother.

217
00:18:59,277 --> 00:19:03,174
Ruoxi, don't overthink too much.

218
00:19:03,174 --> 00:19:05,969
There are many things that can be decided by neither of us.

219
00:19:07,054 --> 00:19:08,918
Why did he yell at 8th Prince?

220
00:19:09,963 --> 00:19:13,535
Today, Imperial Brother was following the orders of our father to build a Taoist temple.

221
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:14,568
At the main gate, there was set up

222
00:19:14,568 --> 00:19:16,797
a changing room and workroom, in which he was resting.

223
00:19:16,797 --> 00:19:18,294
Because everything was new and untested,

224
00:19:18,294 --> 00:19:20,775
the fuel they used started smoking.

225
00:19:21,279 --> 00:19:24,111
The Ministry of Works is responsible for this

226
00:19:24,111 --> 00:19:26,891
and 8th Brother is in charge of the Ministry of Works.

227
00:19:26,891 --> 00:19:28,470
Imperial Brother was just upset at the time

228
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:30,095
and so he reprimanded him.

229
00:19:30,095 --> 00:19:31,720
Was it just a rebuke?

230
00:19:33,394 --> 00:19:35,180
He also punished 8th Brother

231
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:37,316
for doing a mediocre job

232
00:19:37,316 --> 00:19:39,195
by having him kneel for a night outside the temple.

233
00:19:40,289 --> 00:19:41,200
Ruoxi!

234
00:19:43,082 --> 00:19:45,676
What do you want to do? To plead mercy?

235
00:19:45,676 --> 00:19:46,976
So what if I do?

236
00:19:46,976 --> 00:19:48,803
What had to be said, I have already said.

237
00:19:48,803 --> 00:19:50,861
What needed pleading for, I have already done that too.

238
00:19:51,481 --> 00:19:53,199
Imperial Brother just meant it lightly,

239
00:19:53,199 --> 00:19:54,699
but since it was uttered by him
(so it becomes an order)

240
00:19:54,699 --> 00:19:57,146
he cannot take back his words.

241
00:19:58,361 --> 00:20:00,093
I want to give it a try anyway.

242
00:20:00,093 --> 00:20:01,047
Ruoxi!

243
00:20:02,871 --> 00:20:04,986
I have something more to tell you.

244
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:16,379
Ruoxi,

245
00:20:17,037 --> 00:20:19,684
although Imperial Brother has not bestowed a title on  you or decreed anything,

246
00:20:19,684 --> 00:20:21,147
in the eyes of the People,

247
00:20:21,147 --> 00:20:23,090
by him keeping you at Yangxin Dian,

248
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:25,630
anybody can see that

249
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:27,773
you are his woman.

250
00:20:27,997 --> 00:20:32,908
Back then, I worried

251
00:20:32,908 --> 00:20:34,345
whether you could treat Imperial Brother wholeheartedly or not.

252
00:20:34,941 --> 00:20:36,695
But now I see how much you love him

253
00:20:36,695 --> 00:20:38,949
and it's no less than his love for you.

254
00:20:39,537 --> 00:20:41,064
That being the case,

255
00:20:41,611 --> 00:20:44,954
you should completely let go of 8th Brother.

256
00:20:47,408 --> 00:20:49,212
If you were in my situation

257
00:20:49,212 --> 00:20:51,231
and if the same thing happened,

258
00:20:51,231 --> 00:20:53,478
would you become a stranger to him?

259
00:20:53,478 --> 00:20:55,043
Could you stay unconcerned?

260
00:20:59,785 --> 00:21:02,255
What you cannot even do,

261
00:21:02,255 --> 00:21:04,298
why then request it of me?

262
00:21:04,298 --> 00:21:06,249
I know that it will be very difficult,

263
00:21:06,811 --> 00:21:09,205
but the situation has changed.

264
00:21:09,205 --> 00:21:11,288
Before he was your brother-in-law,

265
00:21:11,288 --> 00:21:11,952
but now,

266
00:21:11,952 --> 00:21:14,338
he doesn't have any relationship with you.

267
00:21:14,338 --> 00:21:16,417
If you still constantly keep him in mind,

268
00:21:16,417 --> 00:21:19,668
once Imperial Brother finds out

269
00:21:19,668 --> 00:21:22,062
you will end up hurting 8th Brother.

270
00:21:24,448 --> 00:21:26,241
I still remember

271
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:28,811
back then, you even wanted me

272
00:21:28,811 --> 00:21:30,398
to tell the late Emperor about us.

273
00:21:30,807 --> 00:21:32,285
You said that

274
00:21:32,285 --> 00:21:35,458
I thought 4th Prince was too petty.

275
00:21:35,458 --> 00:21:37,340
Zuo Ying could accept Minmin,

276
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:39,809
but 4th Prince could not accept me.

277
00:21:40,907 --> 00:21:42,558
Did you forget that?

278
00:21:43,881 --> 00:21:46,689
How long ago was that...

279
00:21:46,689 --> 00:21:48,772
and you still remember every word.

280
00:21:50,547 --> 00:21:52,000
Ruoxi,

281
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:55,100
The us we are now

282
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:57,980
is no longer the us from back then.

283
00:21:57,980 --> 00:21:59,600
Back then he was the 4th Prince,

284
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:04,220
now he is the Emperor.

285
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:09,120
What should I do now then?

286
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:11,600
If you really want good things for 8th Prince,

287
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,600
just let it all go.

288
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:21,680
Buddha...

289
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:24,100
Will you please help me?

290
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:26,660
When reading your advice, it makes a lot of sense.

291
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:29,020
But this wise advice can't be used in this actual situation.

292
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:40,300
The servants say you have already knelt here for 2 hours.

293
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,560
You also have had no dinner.

294
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:45,700
If this continues your knees will not be able to withstand it.

295
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:47,520
Get up now.

296
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:55,080
The people in Yangxin Palace Hall that know about our situation

297
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:58,840
wouldn't dare talk about Court matters in front of you.

298
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:06,360
So I'm assuming it came from 13th Brother.

299
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:08,660
Stand up now.

300
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:12,360
"Coveting, anger, hating, and blame will need to lead to being sorry."

301
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:16,800
" In a flash of an eye, the splendid disappears"

302
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:19,720
Many years have quickly gone by,

303
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:25,340
why can't you just forget about whatever happened in the past?

304
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:28,240
Each and every action has its consequences.

305
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:01,200
At 8th Prince's age now...

306
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,860
if he has to kneel on the hard ground,

307
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:08,300
how will he endure it?

308
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,440
How long do you plan on kneeling for?

309
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,520
Are you keeping pace with him?

310
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:36,560
I, the Emperor, order you to get up!

311
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:44,740
Are you really being the Emperor now

312
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,220
to order me?

313
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:47,520
Yes!

314
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:50,660
Your servant obediently follows your order.

315
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:01,660
Thank you, Emperor.

316
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:12,900
Just what is it that I should do?

317
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:16,340
And what should I do from now on?

318
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:21,580
Lady Ruoxi, Lady Ruoxi!

319
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:43,560
My Lady.

320
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,160
I want to stay here by myself.

321
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,660
Don't disturb me.

322
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,420
I don't allow you to kneel, so you stand instead!

323
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:11,400
Do you still want your legs?

324
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:24,140
I've already let him return!

325
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:36,860
My Lady!

326
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:41,080
Lady, Lady are you all right?

327
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:56,240
Older Sister has returned to the Pei Palace.

328
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,640
The Emperor will be unhappy.

329
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:37,040
"Things remain the same, people do not."

330
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:40,400
So this is what it meant.

331
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:49,940
Jie'jie, don't be so sad.

332
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:51,200
It's my fault.

333
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,340
Originally, I wanted to decorate this place

334
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:54,960
the same as when you used to live here.

335
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,740
But it has made Older Sister sad.

336
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:58,820
I will find someone to redecorate it.

337
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:02,620
No need to, I like it a lot.

338
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:05,280
Sit down and chat with me.

339
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:33,700
How much I want

340
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:37,020
to just live peacefully like this.

341
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:40,260
When I am old

342
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:43,740
I can lie in the sun in the garden.

343
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:46,340
Gossip a little.

344
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:51,100
Living on peacefully until the end.

345
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:57,040
To live in this Palace for so many years,

346
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,400
the only thing we can wish for

347
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:02,400
is peace and quiet.

348
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:06,900
But for me, you have given it all up.

349
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:09,640
Jie'jie, don't say that

350
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:11,580
This is Yutan's choice.

351
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:20,340
I heard Tibet has started a war again.

352
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:22,140
His Majesty is busy all day,

353
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:24,420
so he probably won't come here.

354
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:28,620
Everyone's saying

355
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:31,360
General Nian has become very popular among the court officials.

356
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:34,100
Even 13th Prince has been given the cold shoulder.

357
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:43,460
I've also heard that

358
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:45,480
Older Sister's father and brother

359
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:47,920
have been sent to the far Southwest

360
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,180
and demoted to civilian status

361
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:51,702
to do minor court work.

362
00:30:51,702 --> 00:30:53,160
All right, enough.

363
00:30:54,930 --> 00:30:57,173
The palace is full of rumors.

364
00:30:57,173 --> 00:30:59,460
Don't be bothered with these things.

365
00:31:02,141 --> 00:31:04,000
As long as we can stay in this little courtyard palace

366
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,274
and live peacefully,

367
00:31:06,274 --> 00:31:09,092
why bother with news from the Imperial Court.

368
00:32:04,861 --> 00:32:06,400
It's cold out here,

369
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,412
why are you sleeping there?

370
00:32:10,848 --> 00:32:13,328
The sun was out just now.

371
00:32:15,736 --> 00:32:17,900
The next half of one's life is so easy going.

372
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:20,347
I came to drink a good cup of tea.

373
00:32:20,347 --> 00:32:22,530
But it's so hard to come by.

374
00:32:22,530 --> 00:32:24,339
For what are you

375
00:32:24,339 --> 00:32:26,586
sighing about?

376
00:32:28,354 --> 00:32:30,602
Have you heard all the rumors?

377
00:32:31,432 --> 00:32:33,311
I didn't want to hear them

378
00:32:33,311 --> 00:32:34,790
but there are too many people talking,

379
00:32:34,790 --> 00:32:36,948
so I hear about things anyway.

380
00:32:36,948 --> 00:32:38,823
Can't even be a help now.

381
00:32:41,285 --> 00:32:43,367
Are you and Nian Gengyao really not on good terms?

382
00:32:43,367 --> 00:32:45,486
It's him that doesn't get along with me.

383
00:32:45,486 --> 00:32:47,508
He's been following the Emperor for so many years,

384
00:32:47,508 --> 00:32:48,715
the Emperor doting on him

385
00:32:48,715 --> 00:32:51,120
now is only due to years of his hard work.

386
00:32:51,657 --> 00:32:53,382
As for me, I didn't do anything for 10 years

387
00:32:53,382 --> 00:32:55,542
and once I'm released, everything became within my reach.

388
00:32:55,542 --> 00:32:57,399
It's natural for him to think it's unfair.

389
00:32:57,399 --> 00:32:58,932
What's there to fight about then?

390
00:32:59,691 --> 00:33:01,323
Position and wealth,

391
00:33:01,323 --> 00:33:03,367
13th Prince doesn't care about them.

392
00:33:04,215 --> 00:33:07,477
It's you that doesn't care about your own business.

393
00:33:10,976 --> 00:33:14,148
My father and brother are fine with it this way.

394
00:33:14,998 --> 00:33:17,149
Father's getting old,

395
00:33:17,149 --> 00:33:21,700
what's wrong with living in peaceful retirement,

396
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:24,876
far away from Imperial Courts, and with little to do.

397
00:33:24,876 --> 00:33:28,591
Not having a lot of things to do means far less mistakes.

398
00:33:28,591 --> 00:33:31,695
Even if someone tries to provoke you.

399
00:33:31,695 --> 00:33:34,621
General Nian enjoys fighting,

400
00:33:34,621 --> 00:33:36,339
so let him occupy himself.

401
00:33:36,339 --> 00:33:37,832
Ruoxi, oh, Ruoxi...

402
00:33:37,832 --> 00:33:39,776
I was not wrong about you.

403
00:33:39,776 --> 00:33:41,958
You are so clear about everything.

404
00:33:43,478 --> 00:33:47,670
Once the moon is full, it starts to wane.

405
00:33:47,670 --> 00:33:50,723
Once you're at the top,

406
00:33:50,723 --> 00:33:52,988
the only place to go is down.

407
00:33:53,693 --> 00:33:55,797
Nian Gengyao is a current example.

408
00:33:55,797 --> 00:33:58,784
I believe he still doesn't know this principle

409
00:33:58,784 --> 00:34:01,865
and doesn't comprehend that 13th Prince and the Emperor have been close ever since childhood.

410
00:34:01,865 --> 00:34:03,405
Don't look at me like that.

411
00:34:03,405 --> 00:34:06,416
Imperial Brother will get jealous if he saw it.

412
00:34:06,416 --> 00:34:09,088
I didn't realize 13th Prince was so keen and cautious

413
00:34:09,088 --> 00:34:11,632
that he could actually predict the future.

414
00:34:11,632 --> 00:34:13,845
I wonder when the fight between you two

415
00:34:13,845 --> 00:34:16,399
will end.

416
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:18,281
I'm not angry.

417
00:34:18,806 --> 00:34:20,207
I just think that

418
00:34:20,207 --> 00:34:22,282
this seems just fine.

419
00:34:22,282 --> 00:34:25,681
Maybe it's better for me live peacefully alone.

420
00:34:26,499 --> 00:34:27,793
The best option

421
00:34:27,793 --> 00:34:30,533
would be if he'd kick me out of the Palace.

422
00:34:30,533 --> 00:34:31,912
Ruoxi.

423
00:34:31,912 --> 00:34:33,908
How can you still be so stubborn?

424
00:34:33,908 --> 00:34:35,480
I've constantly tried to persuade you,

425
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:37,624
yet you won't listen..

426
00:34:37,624 --> 00:34:40,121
Are you here to mediate

427
00:34:40,121 --> 00:34:42,562
or do you want me to go beg for his forgiveness?

428
00:34:52,906 --> 00:34:54,358
You're not wrong.

429
00:34:54,746 --> 00:34:56,796
But the Emperor isn't wrong either.

430
00:34:56,796 --> 00:34:58,452
You two both have your own viewpoints.

431
00:34:58,452 --> 00:34:59,892
I just...

432
00:35:05,529 --> 00:35:06,897
Ruoxi.

433
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,040
I know your affection for Imperial Brother.

434
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:13,000
I also know that

435
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,860
you can't stop worrying about 8th Brother and the others.

436
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:23,800
These last few days

437
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:26,400
Imperial Brother has never mentioned you to me

438
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,420
and there's no one

439
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:29,580
who dares to mention you in front of him.

440
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:31,060
But his brows

441
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:33,100
are always furrowed.

442
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,820
Normally, no matter how busy the Court gets,

443
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:37,680
once he goes to Yanxin Palace

444
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,460
he gets to relax.

445
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:42,260
But recently,

446
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:45,280
his face shows no sign of warmth.

447
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:48,520
Everyone thinks it's because of the war in the Northwest,

448
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:50,040
but in reality

449
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:54,460
that's only half of the reason.

450
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:58,500
Back then Luwu and I

451
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:00,640
were imprisoned based on our culture

452
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:05,000
mixed in with real human lives and blood, with no way out.

453
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:08,160
Both of you,

454
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,840
why can't you just get along?

455
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:13,040
There is already too much misery in life,

456
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:16,940
why do you bring misery upon yourself because of love?

457
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,420
Ruoxi,

458
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:30,400
allow yourself to live more freely.

459
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,380
Some things,

460
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:42,260
if you can let go, just let them go!

461
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:13,040
My Lady.

462
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,760
Your servant greets the Lady.

463
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:16,500
Rise.

464
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:18,220
Thank you, My Lady.

465
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:19,720
My Lady, the Emperor

466
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:22,500
told me to come over here to send you home.

467
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:24,620
I'm fine staying here.

468
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:26,100
My Lady!

469
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:27,540
Please have sympathy on your servant and

470
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:29,080
come home with me!

471
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:32,880
Hurry and get up, I can't stand that sort of thing.

472
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:33,640
My Lady...

473
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:35,420
If you don't come back with me

474
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:37,140
then I shall keep kneeling here!

475
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:38,660
Older Sister.

476
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:47,440
Get up.

477
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,780
I'll go with you.

478
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:50,240
Really?

479
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:51,180
Thank you,

480
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:52,280
for understanding this servant!

481
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:53,500
Thank you!

482
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:58,180
My Lady, after you then.

483
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:19,400
Still angry?

484
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:23,460
It's been a couple of days, your anger should be gone.

485
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:32,120
Why can't we be how 13th brother describes it

486
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:34,400
and try to get along well with each other?

487
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:42,220
In regards to those unhappy things,

488
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:43,980
let's just not mention them anymore.

489
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:45,880
Let them pass, all right?

490
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:51,940
Is the heat pouch useful?

491
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,380
It's fine.

492
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:07,140
You didn't miss me at all?

493
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:11,100
I always miss you.

494
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:22,360
You should go find Nian Fei.
(Fei - Consort)

495
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:34,120
Don't be sad, all right?

496
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:37,040
If you keep crying, you'll hurt your body.

497
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:42,700
My darling Ruoxi,

498
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:45,103
don't be sad.

499
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:49,180
I really don't know how to humor people.

500
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:50,700
Please forgive me.

501
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:53,740
Who believes that?

502
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:56,680
Aren't you the Emperor?

503
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:03,140
The Emperor is also human.

504
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:11,020
"Time passes by too quickly."

505
00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:18,700
"I wiped my tears and heaved long sighs.

506
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:21,680
I lamented over the hazard of life’s journey despite being cautious.

507
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:26,600
Hence their future was dark and risky.

508
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:32,000
I am not afraid of incurring disasters, I only worry about my country being overthrown."

509
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,620
Didn't you hate learning these things the most?
(Referring to lyrical ancient Chinese poems)

510
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:37,800
When did you memorize Li Sao?
(The Lament)

511
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,560
You really do like magnolias.

512
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:43,840
The necklace and earrings are both magnolias

513
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:45,360
I'm was curious as to

514
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:47,280
why you like them so much.

515
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:50,760
In Li Sao's poem,

516
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:53,920
there's a part where he writes about an unknown person who does not love fame and fortune

517
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,840
but only wishes to wear magnolias.

518
00:41:57,780 --> 00:41:58,960
Like the magnolia

519
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:01,960
represents a sort of non-secular common outfit.

520
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:03,980
Am I one?

521
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:06,800
You always worry about the well being of commoners

522
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:09,620
and a good Emperor thinks about his people.

523
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,740
Again, when did you memorize Li Sao?

524
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:18,360
I'm not telling you

525
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:21,660
You'll start being arrogant if I tell you.

526
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:02,480
I've gone to attend court.

527
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:18,360
Yutan, thanks for bringing my stuff back.

528
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:20,180
Don't be so polite with me.

529
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:24,760
Wheres the Morning Dew Magnolia?

530
00:43:25,540 --> 00:43:26,600
Here it is.

531
00:43:28,601 --> 00:43:29,380
Jie'jie,

532
00:43:29,380 --> 00:43:30,970
what is written on top?

533
00:43:32,454 --> 00:43:34,585
"In the morning I drank dew drops on the lily magnolia

534
00:43:34,585 --> 00:43:36,668
and in the evening I ate fallen flowers of the autumn chrysanthemums."

535
00:43:36,668 --> 00:43:38,600
Whose poem is that?

536
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:40,120
Li Sao.

537
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:45,160
What Nian Gengyao said is correct.

538
00:43:49,112 --> 00:43:51,580
It all comes down to money,

539
00:43:51,580 --> 00:43:54,220
everything else is not important.

540
00:43:54,220 --> 00:43:56,880
But food provisions are the highest priority, don't delay them.

541
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:58,000
Yes.

542
00:44:21,438 --> 00:44:22,840
Looks like today

543
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:25,110
I have to thank Imperial brother.

544
00:44:25,110 --> 00:44:26,621
If it weren't for your being here,

545
00:44:26,621 --> 00:44:28,432
I would not get to taste something so delicious.

546
00:44:41,060 --> 00:44:42,821
"In the morning I drank dew drops on the lily magnolia,

547
00:44:42,821 --> 00:44:44,925
and in the evening I ate fallen flowers of the autumn chrysanthemums."

548
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:48,843
Imperial Brother is always worried about court issues

549
00:44:48,843 --> 00:44:50,793
so Ruoxi won't blame you.

550
00:44:50,793 --> 00:44:52,440
I believe her efforts

551
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:55,730
are well worth it as long as you ate some.

552
00:44:57,139 --> 00:44:59,215
Ever since this morning,

553
00:44:59,215 --> 00:45:00,887
I see you massaging your shoulder.

554
00:45:00,887 --> 00:45:02,280
Is there something wrong?

555
00:45:02,635 --> 00:45:04,219
It's nothing.

556
00:45:04,219 --> 00:45:06,761
It's still better to have the doctor to check it.

557
00:45:06,761 --> 00:45:07,736
No need.

558
00:45:07,736 --> 00:45:09,755
Just check it out,

559
00:45:09,755 --> 00:45:11,398
there's still a lot of reports to read.

560
00:45:11,398 --> 00:45:13,563
Early detection can prevent later inconveniences.

561
00:45:14,245 --> 00:45:15,900
- Gao Wuyong!
- Ruoxi...

562
00:45:16,715 --> 00:45:17,812
Your servant is here.

563
00:45:17,812 --> 00:45:19,130
Have the doctor come to Yanxin Palace.

564
00:45:19,130 --> 00:45:20,066
Yes

565
00:45:23,767 --> 00:45:25,771
Do you know who you'll pick to send the provisions this time?

566
00:45:25,771 --> 00:45:28,751
I do have a few people in mind.

567
00:45:41,166 --> 00:45:44,197
I was thinking about these men too.

568
00:45:45,876 --> 00:45:47,312
This road suffers from a lot of rain.

569
00:45:47,312 --> 00:45:49,502
You should pay attention to the weather.

570
00:45:49,502 --> 00:45:50,452
Yes.

571
00:45:53,155 --> 00:45:55,284
Emperor, the Imperial Doctor has arrived

572
00:45:57,231 --> 00:45:58,960
Since he's here, have him come in.

573
00:45:58,960 --> 00:45:59,956
Yes,

574
00:46:05,176 --> 00:46:06,901
Greetings, Your Majesty

575
00:46:06,901 --> 00:46:07,976
Rise.

576
00:46:07,976 --> 00:46:08,796
Thank you, Emperor

577
00:46:08,796 --> 00:46:10,025
It's nothing big,

578
00:46:10,025 --> 00:46:11,591
it's just my shoulder that aches.

579
00:46:28,444 --> 00:46:31,426
Your Majesty, it's nothing major.

580
00:46:31,426 --> 00:46:34,415
Some medicine plasters, and rest a bit.

581
00:46:34,415 --> 00:46:35,476
I believe

582
00:46:35,476 --> 00:46:37,551
when Your Majesty is sleeping,

583
00:46:37,551 --> 00:46:39,198
your sleep position is not a good one.

584
00:46:39,198 --> 00:46:42,381
Something heavy is leaning on it.

585
00:46:52,391 --> 00:46:53,409
You may leave.

586
00:46:53,409 --> 00:46:54,198
Yes.
