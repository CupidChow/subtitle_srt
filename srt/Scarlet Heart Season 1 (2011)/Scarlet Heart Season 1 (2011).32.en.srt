Timing and Subtitles brought to you by the Bu Bu Jing Xin Team @Viki.com

2
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:20,660
♫  In the blink of an eye, a thought of stubborn persistence  ♫

3
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:24,530
♫  We were destined to seek our doom like moths flying towards the flame  ♫

4
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:30,710
♫  Knowing that it’d be a disaster, why am I still at a loss about what to do  ♫

5
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:39,120
♫  The best is not to see, the best is not to miss you  ♫

6
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:44,290
♫  Only like this can I not be in love with you  ♫

7
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:48,810
♫  Just another brushing of the shoulder, and from then...♫

8
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:53,600
♫  I’ll keep falling deeper and deeper in love with you  ♫

9
00:00:55,580 --> 00:01:02,350
♫  It’s the mistake of time, ♫
♫ forcing us to pass each other by  ♫

10
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:05,450
♫  How I miss you, how far you are  ♫

11
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:12,270
♫  Even though I’d known it’d only result in pain,  ♫
♫ at this moment, I still don’t want to escape   ♫

12
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:16,790
♫  Pity these words are too glaring, they hurt the eyes  ♫

13
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:19,180
♫  Two worlds later ♫

14
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:22,860
♫  Don’t want to escape  ♫

15
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:25,280
♫  It’s the mistake of time,  ♫

16
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:30,270
♫  we can only pass each other by  ♫

17
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:35,130
♫  The magnitude of me missing you is as much as how far you are   ♫

18
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:41,930
♫  Even though I know the ending is a mistake that I cannot oppose  ♫

19
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:47,000
♫  Staying in this moment  ♫

20
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:55,380
♫  We can only accept that the feelings run deep, but fate is shallow  ♫

21
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:02,400
Scarlet Heart
Episode 32

22
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,100
The physician said that the Lady will wake up today.

23
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:06,360
He was so very right!

24
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:16,900
The Emperor has arrived!

25
00:02:29,174 --> 00:02:31,100
- Greetings, your Majesty.
- Greetings, your Majesty.

26
00:02:55,661 --> 00:02:57,015
I'm sorry.

27
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:02,400
I know you were looking forward to this child.

28
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:09,060
It's all right.

29
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:11,300
Your health is the most important.

30
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,120
Children are all

31
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,800
angels on earth.

32
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:33,060
The heavens did not want our child

33
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:36,240
to come to this world to suffer,

34
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,900
so they took him back.

35
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:45,400
He is now flying in the skies

36
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:48,160
where there are birds circling

37
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:51,620
and with lots of flowers.

38
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:58,640
He will definitely be very happy.

39
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:04,680
He will be.

40
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,540
Please do not blame anyone.

41
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:10,660
If you want to blame someone,

42
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:12,666
blame me, it's my fault.

43
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,020
What is most important right now

44
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:17,640
is your health.

45
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:23,500
If you are worried about other things and people,

46
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,599
then I will really get mad.

47
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:37,604
When you recover,

48
00:04:38,565 --> 00:04:40,599
I will take you out for a walk.

49
00:04:40,599 --> 00:04:42,000
All right?

50
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:22,767
Look at how nice the sunshine is today.

51
00:05:22,992 --> 00:05:24,346
It is very nice.

52
00:05:26,003 --> 00:05:27,280
Are you tired?

53
00:05:32,233 --> 00:05:33,520
The flowers have bloomed.

54
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,000
Come.

55
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,902
The scent of the medicines

56
00:05:50,902 --> 00:05:53,240
cover up the fragrance of the flowers.

57
00:05:55,228 --> 00:05:57,341
I can smell only your fragrance.

58
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,400
You are the Emperor.

59
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:07,906
You will be laughed at if you do this.

60
00:06:07,906 --> 00:06:09,440
An Emperor and his Imperial Concubine...

61
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,400
What is so funny about that?

62
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,200
I've already prepared a title for you,

63
00:06:15,499 --> 00:06:17,055
once you fully recover

64
00:06:17,055 --> 00:06:19,238
we'll perform the ceremony.

65
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,838
Previously,

66
00:06:21,838 --> 00:06:24,183
I didn't want you to give me a title,

67
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:27,240
but after you said it would be for the child...

68
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,570
But our child...

69
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:32,660
There is no longer a need for it.

70
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:37,063
I have nothing to be afraid of anymore.

71
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,560
I am afraid of losing you

72
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:44,420
I don't care if you are willing or not,

73
00:06:45,167 --> 00:06:47,187
your rightful entitlement can no longer wait.

74
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:58,820
I, too, am afraid of losing you.

75
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:03,260
How will you lose me?

76
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:08,520
Actually,

77
00:07:09,084 --> 00:07:10,900
I am not from here.

78
00:07:11,824 --> 00:07:13,704
I am Zhang Xiao.

79
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:17,340
I am not a part of this time.

80
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:21,620
What nonsense are you speaking again?

81
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:25,802
I am afraid that one day,

82
00:07:26,847 --> 00:07:29,460
I will have to leave this place unwillingly.

83
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:33,780
Much like how I had not wanted to come here.

84
00:07:35,717 --> 00:07:36,855
You want to leave?

85
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,660
I don't.

86
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:44,424
If you leave here involuntarily,

87
00:07:45,818 --> 00:07:47,188
no matter where you are,

88
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:50,160
I will come to find you.

89
00:08:03,551 --> 00:08:05,160
Wang'ye,
(Prince)

90
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,412
please obey the Imperial edict and divorce me.

91
00:08:07,412 --> 00:08:10,580
It is better than paying the price with lives of your whole household.

92
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,124
Wang'ye,

93
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:15,600
if it's asked that I accompany you in death,

94
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:20,620
But,

95
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:22,737
now, the ones who will die are not just you and I,

96
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:24,618
there is also Hong Wang

97
00:08:24,618 --> 00:08:28,140
and the hundreds of lives in this whole household!

98
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:33,951
Wang'ye, think about

99
00:08:33,951 --> 00:08:35,860
those who have followed you since you were young.

100
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:37,900
Think about my family.

101
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:42,420
Disobeying the edict is a huge crime!

102
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:45,220
If the Emperor learns of it,

103
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:48,579
every one of us will be implicated.

104
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:17,700
Wang'ye.

105
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:20,580
For Hong Wang,

106
00:10:21,461 --> 00:10:22,940
for everybody,

107
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:30,620
for my family... I beg of you.

108
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,460
Thank you.

109
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:58,497
Ming Hui!

110
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:03,300
Back then,

111
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,080
I only saw your position and status

112
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:11,300
and not your deep love.

113
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:14,340
Causing you to be in this state now

114
00:12:16,423 --> 00:12:17,700
and letting you return,

115
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:20,740
at least, you may be able to save your life.

116
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,820
There is no need to be worried every day now

117
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:27,380
or having to make any more sacrifices.

118
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:49,100
Wang'ye... I understand.

119
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:55,420
In my heart,

120
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:59,420
you will always be with me.

121
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:16,060
8th Fujin.

122
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:23,020
I will leave Wang'ye in your care.

123
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,060
I ask 8th Fujin to be at ease.

124
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,240
No matter what happens,

125
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:32,980
Li Fu will always be here to take care of Wang'ye.

126
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:17,420
Lady Ruoxi.

127
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:19,180
Who is inside?

128
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:20,120
13th Prince

129
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,720
Do you want me to announce your arrival?

130
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,980
Has 8th not fulfilled my order?

131
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:25,080
Imperial Brother.

132
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,820
Even if it was wrong of 8th Consort,

133
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:29,200
she was titled by our Imperial Father.

134
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,260
Besides annuling this marriage,

135
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:32,140
there are also other ways!

136
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:35,140
Since they are talking about court matters,

137
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:36,560
I don't want to interrupt.

138
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,880
Understood, Milady.

139
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:46,260
You go back first.

140
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,740
I have things to talk about with 13th Prince.

141
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:49,460
- Yes.
- Yes.

142
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,340
13th Prince.

143
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:03,020
How come you are not resting,

144
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:04,340
but standing out here in the wind?

145
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:06,020
What did the Emperor demand?

146
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:12,220
He commanded 8th Brother to divorce 8th Fujin.

147
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:15,820
Did the 8th Prince obey?

148
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:17,560
The Emperor ordered it the other day

149
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:18,880
and up to today when I entered the Palace,

150
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,020
he still hasn't.

151
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:24,080
The 8th Prince cannot divorce 8th Fujin,

152
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,760
it will cost a life.

153
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:28,100
You go and stop 8th Prince (from signing).

154
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:29,380
I will try to convince the Emperor.

155
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:35,340
Do you really think 8th Brother will listen to me?

156
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,900
Then I will go with you.

157
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:46,420
Fine, it's better if I do this with you,

158
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:47,760
so if worst comes to worst,

159
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,180
then I will be the one punished by Imperial Brother.

160
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:03,960
13th Wang'ye.

161
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:04,740
13th Wang'ye!

162
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:05,700
Our master has stated that he will not meet with anyone today.

163
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:06,860
Move aside, now!

164
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:09,180
13th Prince!

165
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:09,860
13th Prince!

166
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:11,700
13th Prince! Our master has given us his order,

167
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:13,080
we servants cannot disobey!

168
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,820
Lady Ruoxi, 13th Prince...

169
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:15,860
Move aside!

170
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:19,180
Our master is not feeling well.

171
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:20,500
He really will not be able to receive guests.

172
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:22,620
Did 8th Prince order this?

173
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:26,420
Master has commanded us, so...

174
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:27,540
Oh no!

175
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:38,700
Master?

176
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:43,100
13th Prince and Lady Ruoxi wish to see you.

177
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,780
Leave!

178
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:47,300
I'm not seeing anyone!

179
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:52,300
Get out!

180
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:59,340
What else do you want to do?

181
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:03,180
Do you plan on

182
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:04,500
taking my life,

183
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,060
so he will be satisfied?

184
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:09,020
If the Emperor allows,

185
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,480
I want it too!

186
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,420
You cannot divorce 8th Fujin.

187
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:27,140
You should go tell him!

188
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:29,420
Did 8th Fujin leave?

189
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:30,979
Just what more do you want!

190
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:33,200
13th, when you came looking for me,

191
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,680
I'd already promised you

192
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:38,580
that I would definitely not let them do as they wished!

193
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:40,720
Why then

194
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,380
is there still such an outcome?

195
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:45,100
Now is not the time to speak of this.

196
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:46,700
Quickly find 8th Fujin

197
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:48,260
or I'm afraid something will happen.

198
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,060
Something will happen?

199
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:54,960
What else can happen?

200
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,020
Add on another crime?

201
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:02,260
What do you want to do to Ming Hui and Hong Wang?

202
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:09,520
I don't wish to see you.

203
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,700
Don't make me chase you out!

204
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,300
Wake up!

205
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:15,120
8th Fujin is your wife of many years.

206
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,060
Her feelings for you,

207
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:18,180
how much do you actually understand?

208
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:21,620
I understand.

209
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,300
Of course, I understand

210
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:29,020
When everyone else gave up on me,

211
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:32,520
only she

212
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:34,240
was there to take care of me, comfort me.

213
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:39,740
When I was fighting, she always supported me.

214
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:42,180
When I gave up,

215
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:45,380
she also did not say anything.

216
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:48,440
No doubt!

217
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:52,020
I am crazy, stupid, and a fool!

218
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:54,080
I had a precious pearl by my side,

219
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,260
but I still went around looking for one more.

220
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:01,300
I've sworn

221
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:05,420
I will use what's left of my life to treat her well.

222
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:11,180
But why are the heavens so cruel?

223
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:14,780
I've always given way,

224
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:17,060
but I'm still being cornered by the Emperor!

225
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:20,560
I thought, that by being careful,

226
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,980
I could exchange that for some peace!

227
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:28,780
But I have just recently realized,

228
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:31,380
that it is impossible.

229
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:40,900
My end

230
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:44,220
has been settled already.

231
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:49,980
But she is different.

232
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:53,580
The only thing I can do for her

233
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:56,480
is to let her go.

234
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:59,500
You may understand everything,

235
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:02,740
but why can't you see her true heart?

236
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,900
You think that letting her go is the best choice,

237
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:08,820
because you don't want her to be

238
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:10,580
walking down the same path as you.

239
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:13,900
But did you know

240
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:15,660
she isn't afraid of being imprisoned

241
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:16,580
or dying?

242
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:17,900
She's not afraid of those things!

243
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:19,700
She's just afraid that you don't want her!

244
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:21,700
You are her everything.

245
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:22,900
But now, you have cruelly

246
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:25,260
taken away her everything!

247
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:03,020
Fire! Fire! Douse the fire!

248
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:06,180
Come help!

249
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:08,600
What's happening?

250
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,140
First Fujin took her life after she set the place afire!

251
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:14,420
Ming' hui!

252
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:15,300
8th Brother!

253
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:17,140
- Ming'hui!
- 8th Brother!
- 8th Prince!

254
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:18,220
- Calm down!
- Ming'hui would not do this!

255
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:19,220
8th Prince!

256
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:21,540
Calm down!  Don't!

257
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:38,860
8th Brother.  8th Brother!

258
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:52,460
Let me go!

259
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:58,140
She only came to find you

260
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:00,580
to express her anguish.

261
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:03,920
What harm did she do to you,

262
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:07,780
to deserve such an ending?

263
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:14,180
Now, are you satisfied!

264
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,940
No harm done to her?

265
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,380
Did you know

266
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,860
because of 8th Fujin's words,

267
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:31,140
the child in Ruoxi's womb

268
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:33,120
is now gone!

269
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,380
In this lifetime, she will never again

270
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:36,220
be able to have another child!

271
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:56,700
Don't forget you still have Hong Wang!

272
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:01,600
Your wife's sacrifice was for whom?

273
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:05,140
You have the answer in your heart,

274
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:10,220
so what should you do next?

275
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:13,340
You have the answer!

276
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:23,100
To drift and live without purpose,

277
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:27,780
living becomes worse than dying.

278
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,660
You've been running around for the whole day.

279
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:14,900
Go rest now.

280
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:36,420
It is almost daylight.

281
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:39,820
It's time for Your Majesty to attend court.

282
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:13,940
Look after her well,

283
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:18,700
she only worries for others,

284
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:20,740
but I only care for her.

285
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:37,500
Ruoxi, don't torment yourself

286
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:42,220
8th Fujin's death had nothing to do with you.

287
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:44,380
I've always thought

288
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:50,820
surviving is hard while seeking death is easy.

289
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:52,940
Turns out,

290
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:56,580
to grow old together may not be as easy

291
00:25:57,940 --> 00:25:59,780
as dying together and it's not fated either.

292
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:02,820
It was not your fault, to begin with.

293
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:07,260
It was also not 8th Brother's or 8th Fujin's fault.

294
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:08,900
Things were complicated.

295
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,420
A cruel trick played on us by fate.

296
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:12,540
Cannot blame Imperial Brother either.

297
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:25,820
In the future,

298
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:31,100
I really won't be able to have children again?

299
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:43,020
It's just as well.

300
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:47,300
Why would I want my child,

301
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:51,900
to suffer here in the Forbidden City.

302
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:07,640
Second Miss!

303
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:09,460
It is all my fault.

304
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:13,000
I caused the death of 8th Fujin.

305
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,600
I should not have let you

306
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,580
meet with 8th Fujin.

307
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:19,620
It has nothing to do with you.

308
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:22,140
Rise now.

309
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:24,560
No. Second Miss...

310
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,860
it is my fault!

311
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:30,020
Second Miss had already told me

312
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:32,080
that in this royal palace,

313
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,860
I must be careful with every step.

314
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:37,880
I didn't pay attention.

315
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:40,260
I thought meeting her once was just a small matter,

316
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:42,660
but in the end, it killed 8th Fujin

317
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,520
and harmed Second Miss as well.

318
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:48,460
Qiao Hui.

319
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:55,200
How could you know the ending?

320
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:58,940
We all do not know

321
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:01,420
Right now,

322
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:04,460
it is only the second year of the Emperor's reign.

323
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:07,560
I originally thought

324
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,660
there would still be a few years of peace.

325
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:12,060
Turns out,

326
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:15,260
it has already begun.

327
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,260
I have faults

328
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:20,940
Second Miss,

329
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:22,860
what are you talking about?

330
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:32,380
Right now... It has only just begun.

331
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:46,860
What did my sister do to you?

332
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:48,220
Why did you treat her that way?

333
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:49,380
Why did you divorce her

334
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:51,380
and force her to suicide?

335
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:54,080
My sister loved you deeply,

336
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,820
would do anything for you,

337
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:56,680
no matter what!

338
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:59,140
What have you ever done for her?

339
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:03,320
For everything she did for you,

340
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:05,820
this is the outcome she received!

341
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:08,580
Did you even love her a little?

342
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,340
Did you?

343
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:22,780
True, I let Minghui down.

344
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:25,540
I owe her.

345
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:27,260
I know.

346
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:30,260
I know that even after her death,

347
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:33,300
my sister will never hate you.

348
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:35,300
But I...

349
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:36,980
I hate you!

350
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:39,380
I hate you to death!

351
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:41,440
If not for you,

352
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,140
my sister would not have died.

353
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,700
You are a murderer!

354
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:49,580
Give my sister back to me.

355
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:55,580
Give my sister back to me.

356
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:58,060
Back to me...

357
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:11,720
I know I was wrong.

358
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,340
I should not have been selfish.

359
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:15,320
Should not have been petty.

360
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:18,520
But I truly and deeply care for Beile'ye.

361
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:20,940
I cannot be without Beile'ye.

362
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:24,580
Ever since Beile'ye's rebuke started,

363
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:27,660
I repeatedly ponder on

364
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:32,300
your attitude toward me.

365
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:34,900
The days when you don't see me,

366
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:40,020
I would rather die than live.

367
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:53,500
Ming'hui...  I had such a pearl like you

368
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:55,220
by my side,

369
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:01,460
yet I never cherished you properly.

370
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:04,860
Beile'ye.

371
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:06,940
As long as you don't get upset,

372
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:08,220
whatever the problem,

373
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:10,560
I will help.

374
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:13,100
Seeing you as you are now

375
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:15,360
I really feel awful.

376
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,740
Perhaps this is what it means to be husband and wife,

377
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:21,660
sharing hardships together.

378
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:27,100
I know you have a lot of words

379
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:28,580
to speak to me

380
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:30,640
but can not.

381
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:33,160
However, I can truly feel them deeply.

382
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:36,940
Marrying you,

383
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:40,800
I have never regretted it.

384
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:46,360
A hundred years of mutual cultivation to share the same boat.

385
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:49,660
A millennium of cultivation to be fated as a couple.

386
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:55,460
You have always followed my wishes.

387
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:59,540
Relied on me, supported me

388
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:01,740
without complaint.

389
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:03,580
Minghui,

390
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:05,620
you are the heavens'

391
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:07,780
reward to me.

392
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:09,260
What is this?

393
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:11,400
Really pushing people too far.

394
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,500
How can the Emperor do that?

395
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:20,100
The matter was 2 months ago.

396
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:21,800
By Imperial Father announcing it,

397
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:24,800
it's simply to undoubtedly tell everyone

398
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,980
that he will not forgive me.

399
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:30,260
It's simply to give those who still have hope

400
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:32,280
and are my followers in the Court

401
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:34,300
a clear warning.

402
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:38,980
We don't care for this kind of charity.

403
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:40,940
If we add all our savings together,

404
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:42,160
will probably last more than 8 generations.

405
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,720
Even if we spent it all,

406
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,140
there is still my father.

407
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:46,860
And even if my father

408
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:48,240
doesn't take care of us,

409
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:51,580
Beile'ye,  you still have me.

410
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:06,820
Minghui,

411
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:12,700
I cannot pay you back in this life.

412
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:15,580
In the next life

413
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:18,940
I will repay you a hundred fold.

414
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:22,460
Minghui, I promise you,

415
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:25,660
I will not let you be alone.

416
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:29,640
Previously, you didn't want to see

417
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,220
me being forced by the Emperor

418
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:33,300
and steadily defeated.

419
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:37,380
From now on,

420
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:41,860
I will not back down,

421
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:45,580
even if

422
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:49,460
it means my death.

423
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:52,700
I will gladly

424
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:56,500
meet you soon,

425
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:01,940
I will not let you down.

426
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:10,060
10th Fujin!

427
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:10,980
Let me pass!

428
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:11,880
10th Fujin, you cannot pass!

429
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:12,900
- Move away!
- You cannot pass!

430
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:15,340
Let go, let go now!

431
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:16,820
You cannot treat the 10th Fu'jin so impolitely!

432
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:17,619
You may leave.

433
00:34:17,619 --> 00:34:19,220
- Yes.
- Yes.

434
00:34:21,099 --> 00:34:22,080
Ruoxi.

435
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,539
Greetings, 10th Fujin.

436
00:34:23,539 --> 00:34:25,740
Please let Second Miss go.

437
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:27,300
Move aside.

438
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,380
Please, leave now.

439
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:45,260
What are you doing?

440
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:49,180
I, Gorolo Mingyu,

441
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:51,900
have never begged anyone before in my life.

442
00:34:53,539 --> 00:34:54,860
I, today,

443
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:58,700
came here to beg you.

444
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:01,520
If there is something, please stand up and tell me.

445
00:35:01,579 --> 00:35:02,579
Ruoxi...

446
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:05,860
My sister has already died,

447
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:07,620
and I can no longer stand to look at the 10th Prince

448
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:10,860
living a life worse than death.

449
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:11,660
Instead of letting the Emperor

450
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:13,740
humiliate and torture us so,

451
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:15,900
why not just finish it off?

452
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:19,020
What is going on?

453
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:23,280
Because of the Zhang family,

454
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,740
things were always made difficult and humiliating for the 10th Prince.

455
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:27,320
This is all the doings

456
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:29,820
of the Emperor behind the scenes.

457
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:31,900
10th Prince is somewhat sentimental,

458
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:32,980
so he's throwing a tantrum

459
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:35,180
and refusing to come back.

460
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:38,800
Who knew His Majesty

461
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:41,060
would use this to fault him

462
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:44,960
and order that his post is taken away.

463
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:47,020
He's to be brought back to the capital forcefully

464
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:48,700
and confined!

465
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:55,220
Since the beginning, it's always been the winner that takes all.

466
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:56,900
There is nothing left to argue about.

467
00:35:57,740 --> 00:35:59,820
But, His Majesty...

468
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:00,820
Why does the Emperor

469
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:01,860
torture us so

470
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:04,340
and make things so difficult for us?

471
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:10,240
First, it was the 8th Prince, and then Older Sister.

472
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:14,620
Now, it's me and the 10th Prince.

473
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:18,600
I don't understand

474
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:19,500
why the Emperor cannot

475
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:22,080
take into account his brotherly ties and have

476
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,240
to push us in such a way,

477
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:26,580
that we cannot live nor die.

478
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:31,340
Tenth Prince...

479
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:35,900
Now, it's the 10th Prince's turn.

480
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:37,860
Actually...

481
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:42,040
Actually, I've thought about it.

482
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:45,740
If 10th Prince is arrested and imprisoned,

483
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:48,260
I will be imprisoned with him.

484
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:51,280
If he's to be executed,

485
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:55,020
I will follow him to be executed as well.

486
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:56,700
But,

487
00:36:57,460 --> 00:37:00,120
to be brought back in captivity

488
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:02,500
and to be confined for life,

489
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:04,100
this kind of suffering...

490
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:07,180
do you think 10th Prince will be able to take it?

491
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:10,980
Ruoxi...  Ruoxi.

492
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:12,880
Now, I truly understand

493
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:15,500
my sister's suffering.

494
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:18,060
Seeing the people around you,

495
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:20,500
each of them being tortured in turn,

496
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:23,220
I would rather die!

497
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:25,620
Since I cannot live like this,

498
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:27,420
I seek to die.

499
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:29,700
I beg you...

500
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:34,380
I beg you to speak to his Majesty.

501
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:37,220
Please, I beg you...

502
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:39,420
If he doesn't care about a brother's love,

503
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:41,140
or let us go,

504
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:42,980
then I will beg him

505
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:44,980
to order our deaths.

506
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:46,900
Please... let us die quickly.

507
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:48,860
I beg you, I beg you!

508
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:51,820
I beg you, I beg you!

509
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:54,540
I beg you, Ruoxi!

510
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:57,620
I beg you!

511
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:29,720
10th Fujin, for the 10th Prince to have such a wife as you,

512
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:32,200
is his good fortune.

513
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:38,860
Since I've had 10th Prince in this life,

514
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:42,180
I have no regrets.

515
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:44,840
Don't worry...

516
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:47,540
The one who started this

517
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:49,540
was not you.

518
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:52,740
The one to blame

519
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:56,780
should not be you.

520
00:38:58,220 --> 00:39:00,220
I will not let 10th Prince

521
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:04,220
suffer anymore.

522
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:09,900
Ruoxi...

523
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:23,140
Ruoxi!

524
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:36,300
This is good.

525
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:37,220
Looks like

526
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:38,660
all these officials

527
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:40,960
appreciate my efforts.

528
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:43,280
They're all staying impartial and doing what they need to do.

529
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,440
Even if the higher-ups in the court

530
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:45,580
that were involved in corruption,

531
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:47,900
they also do not hesitate

532
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:49,180
to report them to me.

533
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:51,800
They've done well.

534
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:57,740
13th brother, what's wrong with you?

535
00:39:57,740 --> 00:39:59,220
Brother,

536
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:01,500
I have something

537
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:03,220
I need to tell you.

538
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:05,660
If it's about 10th,

539
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:06,700
then forget it.

540
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:07,780
Brother!

541
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:10,200
I am the Emperor and he is a subject.

542
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:11,700
If I let him off because of our relationship,

543
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:13,100
how am I going to account to the others?

544
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:15,000
10th has never gone against any of your orders.

545
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,860
And he has never shown any signs of usurping the throne.

546
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:20,400
Could you please give him a lighter punishment?

547
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,820
My mind is set.

548
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:24,460
Are you really being impartial

549
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:26,940
or are you just set on

550
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:29,260
destroying him?

551
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:31,280
Enough!

552
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:34,740
I'm punishing him because he deserves it!

553
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:36,200
That bunch of people are scheming

554
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:37,280
and it's pervasive.

555
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:39,140
You've seen it for yourself!

556
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:41,680
I cannot allow a speck of compassion

557
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,060
when dealing with them!

558
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:44,700
But,

559
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:46,280
have you ever

560
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:47,540
thought about Ruoxi?

561
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:49,580
Ruoxi and 10th Brother

562
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:51,060
are childhood playmates.

563
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:52,460
If you do anything to 10th Brother,

564
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:54,380
you are also hurting Ruoxi.

565
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:56,820
Ruoxi has been hurt enough.

566
00:40:56,820 --> 00:40:58,900
I am doing this because of Ruoxi.

567
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:03,920
They are never going to see the end of me!

568
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:06,500
Only then can Ruoxi have peaceful days.

569
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:08,300
Our child,

570
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:10,720
will then not have died in vain!

571
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:12,180
No.

572
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:15,180
Ruoxi will not stand aside and do nothing.

573
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:18,780
She is the 'Death-seeking 13th Sister'.

574
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:21,660
She will not just do nothing.

575
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:23,460
To protect those around her,

576
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:24,700
she is willing to sacrifice everything,

577
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:26,100
even her own life.

578
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:27,900
Do you also want to see

579
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:28,780
Ruoxi put in such a desperate state,

580
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:30,220
before you will stop?!

581
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:32,420
They are the ones who refuse to stop!

582
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:39,020
Our battle

583
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:42,540
is the court's inconsistencies

584
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:44,460
and a battle between brothers!

585
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:46,860
I've always tried to

586
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:48,900
keep Ruoxi out of it.

587
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:52,060
They are the ones who keep implicating her!

588
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:56,260
It's them. It's all their fault!

589
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:07,460
Lady!

590
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:22,940
Gao Wu Yong, you may leave.

591
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:24,460
Understood.

592
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:40,860
In matters of the court,

593
00:42:40,860 --> 00:42:43,040
the Inner Palace cannot interfere.

594
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:47,780
Ruoxi, please go back.

595
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:56,580
Ruoxi, please go back first.

596
00:42:57,660 --> 00:42:59,200
Everything here...

597
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:02,200
let me handle it.

598
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:08,340
Thirteenth Prince,

599
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:11,000
do you still remember

600
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,740
the first time we drank together?

601
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:14,780
Of course.

602
00:43:20,020 --> 00:43:23,360
You could say that we were brought together by wine.

603
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:30,260
Our friendship today,

604
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:33,580
will also end with wine.

605
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:37,300
Ruoxi...

606
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:39,120
What do you want to do?

607
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:40,780
Don't try anything foolish.

608
00:43:46,580 --> 00:43:48,920
I have come today,

609
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:51,460
to tell the truth.

610
00:43:53,220 --> 00:43:54,940
You've always thought that

611
00:43:54,940 --> 00:43:55,940
it is 8th Fujin

612
00:43:55,940 --> 00:43:57,900
who killed our baby.

613
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:01,200
It actually was not her.

614
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:03,180
It's me myself.

615
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:09,000
Stop your nonsense. Go back!

616
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:12,700
Where should I begin?

617
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,740
It's been so long.

618
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:17,260
Ruoxi!

619
00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:22,780
Back then, to 8th Prince,

620
00:44:23,340 --> 00:44:26,200
who was still my brother-in-law,

621
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:27,940
I said a few words.

622
00:44:29,740 --> 00:44:31,260
I told him

623
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:36,100
to be very very careful of the 4th Prince.

624
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:40,300
Long Ke Duo,

625
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:43,140
Nian Gengyao, all of it...

626
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:48,540
Ruoxi, you can plead for mercy,

627
00:44:48,540 --> 00:44:50,000
but you should not

628
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,540
put all the blame on yourself,

629
00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:53,300
it won't help.

630
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:54,720
At that time,

631
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:55,560
there was no possible way

632
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:57,580
you could have said all that.

633
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:00,500
I said all that,

634
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:03,460
because I already knew...

635
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:06,980
I knew everything.

636
00:45:07,780 --> 00:45:10,080
And because I knew,

637
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:12,440
I tried to warn him.

638
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:16,220
This is the absolute truth.

639
00:45:16,220 --> 00:45:19,840
9th Prince and 14th Prince also know what I said.

640
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:22,000
If you don't believe me,

641
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,560
you can check with them.

642
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:25,780
Ruoxi!

643
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:38,460
I'm sorry.

644
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:42,500
The one who caused you to be confined for 10 long years,

645
00:45:43,060 --> 00:45:44,360
was actually

646
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:47,020
someone you've always trusted so much.

647
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:49,540
If not for the warning

648
00:45:49,540 --> 00:45:51,560
I gave to 8th Prince,

649
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:53,180
he would not have acted upon it

650
00:45:53,180 --> 00:45:55,540
and try to set 4th Prince up.

651
00:45:55,540 --> 00:45:58,460
You also wouldn't have been implicated.

652
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:21,500
The suffering you went through,

653
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:24,020
was all because of me.

654
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:28,180
My own body's illness

655
00:46:29,020 --> 00:46:32,020
is also what I deserved.

656
00:46:33,980 --> 00:46:35,420
The child...

657
00:46:36,340 --> 00:46:39,080
also died because of me.

658
00:46:41,220 --> 00:46:43,120
On the surface,

659
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:45,980
it was 8th Prince and that bunch who went against you.

660
00:46:47,300 --> 00:46:49,700
But the instigator,

661
00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:52,000
directly or indirectly,

662
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,300
who caused everything, was me.

663
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:02,640
The person you love the most.

664
00:47:04,660 --> 00:47:05,680
All these years,

665
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:08,620
you've been hating the wrong person!

666
00:47:14,250 --> 00:47:19,660
♫ Stopping here, afraid to go any further,  ♫

667
00:47:20,290 --> 00:47:25,140
♫ so sorrow will be unable to make an appearance  ♫

668
00:47:26,970 --> 00:47:33,200
♫  On the next page, the farewell penned by you,  ♫

669
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:38,490
♫  it was not up to me to refuse  ♫

670
00:47:39,710 --> 00:47:46,240
♫  We’ve walked down this path too hastily  ♫

671
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:52,710
♫  Embracing desires that weren’t realistic  ♫

672
00:47:52,710 --> 00:47:59,140
♫  Not in time, wasn’t able to wait long enough to look back and admire  ♫

673
00:47:59,140 --> 00:48:04,440
♫  The fragrance of magnolia is unable to hide wounds  ♫

674
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:11,050
♫  No longer looking for the sun’s rays peeking through the clouds  ♫

675
00:48:11,050 --> 00:48:17,450
♫  No longer looking for the paradise that we promised each other  ♫

676
00:48:17,450 --> 00:48:23,890
♫  No longer sighing, you once said that life is unpredictable  ♫

677
00:48:23,890 --> 00:48:31,880
♫  The three inches of sunlight that I was unable to borrow  ♫

678
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:40,190
♫  No longer looking for the sunlight peeking through the clouds  ♫

679
00:48:40,190 --> 00:48:46,680
♫  No longer looking for the paradise that we promised each other  ♫

680
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:53,070
♫  No longer sighing, you once said that life is unpredictable  ♫

681
00:48:53,070 --> 00:48:59,610
♫  The three inches of sunlight that I was unable to borrow  ♫

682
00:48:59,610 --> 00:49:08,560
♫  That paradise is the place where I’d loved you  ♫
