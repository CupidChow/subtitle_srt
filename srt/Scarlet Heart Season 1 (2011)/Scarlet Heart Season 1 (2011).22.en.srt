♫  In the blink of an eye, a thought of stubborn persistence  ♫

3
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:24,500
♫  We were destined to seek our doom like moths flying towards the flame  ♫

♫  Only like this can I not be in love with you  ♫

7
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:47,930
♫  Just another brushing of the shoulder, and from then...♫

8

Scarlet Heart
Episode 22

24
00:02:17,805 --> 00:02:18,548
4th Brother.

25
00:02:18,548 --> 00:02:19,779
Have you seen Ming Yue?

26
00:02:19,779 --> 00:02:21,010
She said she was going to come admire the flowers,

27
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:23,880
but I've been waiting forever. She still hasn't come back so I came to find her.

28
00:02:24,261 --> 00:02:26,861
This garden is so big I didn't notice.

29
00:02:28,301 --> 00:02:30,760
4th Brother, why are you in such a good mood today

30
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,643
that you came to admire the scenery today?

31
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,760
I'm just accompanying my son for a walk.

32
00:02:36,149 --> 00:02:37,496
Why don't we go look over there?

33
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,880
Alright, 4th Brother.

34
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:01,621
Greetings, 10th Fujin.

35
00:03:01,621 --> 00:03:02,875
Rise.

36
00:03:04,315 --> 00:03:05,940
Can you walk along with me?

37
00:03:07,287 --> 00:03:08,495
In my lifetime,

38
00:03:08,495 --> 00:03:10,027
I've only had one fight.

39
00:03:10,027 --> 00:03:11,142
What about you?

40
00:03:11,142 --> 00:03:12,814
I've fought several times.

41
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:15,275
In the northwest,

42
00:03:16,482 --> 00:03:19,129
I've heard that it is very wild.

43
00:03:19,129 --> 00:03:22,148
But your sister, is not like you.

44
00:03:22,612 --> 00:03:24,259
That day I was so angry,

45
00:03:24,259 --> 00:03:26,885
but now when I think of it, it was quite fun.

46
00:03:26,885 --> 00:03:28,800
I can't believe that I

47
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:32,968
was fighting on a bridge with you.

48
00:03:32,968 --> 00:03:35,160
That was my first time fighting.

49
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,891
Compared to your experienced hand, I didn't do too badly.

50
00:03:38,341 --> 00:03:40,120
At that time I was too hotheaded.

51
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,680
No, I was impertinent first.

52
00:03:43,185 --> 00:03:44,044
In reality,

53
00:03:44,602 --> 00:03:46,400
we both did it for our older sisters,

54
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,131
there's no assigning blame.

55
00:03:48,131 --> 00:03:50,964
It's just, that we were on different sides.

56
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,320
On the surface,

57
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,480
my sister appears to have the advantage.

58
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,200
But actually not at all,

59
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,650
Bei'le takes care of your sister extremely well.

60
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:01,065
Even though your sister doesn't ask anything,

61
00:04:01,065 --> 00:04:03,240
if my sister receives something

62
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,616
your sister will not lack it either.

63
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,280
What advantage does my sister have?

64
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,888
Reading Buddhist scriptures?

65
00:04:10,353 --> 00:04:13,093
My sister has been extraordinary since childhood.

66
00:04:13,093 --> 00:04:15,136
She acts the same compared to others.

67
00:04:15,136 --> 00:04:17,160
The Minghui Ge'ge of the Forbidden City in the past

68
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,160
is not a false reputation.

69
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,000
Although your sister's horseback riding skills were above average,

70
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,889
you have never seen my sister's abilities.

71
00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:25,422
Compared with my sister,

72
00:04:25,422 --> 00:04:27,199
your sister is a flowered spear,

73
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:29,021
beautiful and elegant,

74
00:04:29,021 --> 00:04:32,551
but she is not very useful.

75
00:04:33,433 --> 00:04:34,594
But,

76
00:04:34,919 --> 00:04:37,240
women are better off elegant.

77
00:04:38,309 --> 00:04:40,585
My sister isn't the way you think.

78
00:04:40,956 --> 00:04:42,760
She's never purposely tried to gain 8th Prince's favor

79
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:46,240
and never thinks about fighting with your sister for him.

80
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,320
This is what my sister hates the most.

81
00:04:49,687 --> 00:04:51,560
Actually, in our Qing customs,

82
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,704
a son's status depends on his mother.

83
00:04:53,983 --> 00:04:55,762
But 8th Prince's birth

84
00:04:55,762 --> 00:04:58,562
was much worse than all the other princes'.
( His mother was from the Manchu slave caste )

85
00:04:58,562 --> 00:05:00,840
Father was against their marriage,

86
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,120
but my sister

87
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,720
was in love with 8th Prince

88
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,454
and did as she wished.

89
00:05:06,336 --> 00:05:07,822
Before I didn't know why,

90
00:05:07,822 --> 00:05:10,520
but now I understand.

91
00:05:11,259 --> 00:05:13,800
Women are always the foolish ones.

92
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,880
They know there's fire there, but purposely go ahead anyway,

93
00:05:17,528 --> 00:05:20,639
only thinking that there might also be warmth.

94
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,682
My sister is a silly moth.

95
00:05:26,682 --> 00:05:28,760
She had never spoken a single word to Bei'le

96
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:32,360
and had only seen him a few times before declaring she must marry him.

97
00:05:32,923 --> 00:05:35,880
Jie Jie said that the first time she saw 8th Prince,

98
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,880
he was looking at the scenery from a bridge.

99
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,280
From afar, he looked like an angel,

100
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:42,120
without a hint of mortality.

101
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,560
From then on,

102
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,980
all of Bei'le's happiness and anger,

103
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:48,240
sadness and pain,

104
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,220
my Jie'jie takes to heart and everything else about 8th Prince.

105
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:51,480
I never thought of

106
00:05:52,063 --> 00:05:54,520
your sister also being an emotional person

107
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,720
who feels deeply.

108
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,520
From uncles to brothers,

109
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,600
my sister did whatever she could for Bei'le-'ye,

110
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,600
but Eight Prince's heart

111
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,980
has never been with my sister.

112
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:06,880
What did your sister do?

113
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,720
She rarely even smiles

114
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,840
and doesn't compete at all,

115
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,880
yet she got Bei'le-ye's heart.

116
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,540
They are just girls with an infatuation.

117
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:16,940
Although the saying begins like that

118
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:19,760
it ends with, 'but even a nun will get angry'.

119
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:23,040
Not to mention, my sister is such a proud person.

120
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:26,240
I can understand 8th Fu'jin's feelings,

121
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,840
but she cannot vent her anger on my sister for it.

122
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:30,760
Vent her anger?

123
00:06:31,405 --> 00:06:33,000
If she really wanted to attack your sister,

124
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,080
do you think

125
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,880
she could still peacefully read scriptures at the altar?

126
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:40,000
It is like deciding to hit a mouse that's near a jade vase,

127
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,920
you can't bear to break it.

128
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,840
If my sister is a mouse,

129
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,400
then the 8th Prince is also a mouse

130
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,287
and your sister can bear to run away.

131
00:06:50,392 --> 00:06:51,240
Alright, alright.

132
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,200
Today we really talked and understand the situation,

133
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,680
so we won't argue about this anymore.

134
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:59,360
Now, you don't have to hide once you see me

135
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,160
and he, from now on, doesn't have to worry anymore.

136
00:07:02,512 --> 00:07:05,538
He? Who is he?

137
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,520
Candied haw,

138
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,720
what kind of stupid are you pretending to be?

139
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,040
Compared to my sister,

140
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,640
you're a lot happier,

141
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,560
treasure 10th Prince.

142
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,480
Don't waste my efforts

143
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,680
in getting him to realize by calling myself a  'candied haw'.

144
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:23,080
I know 10th Prince's good points well.

145
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:27,200
I don't need a single person like you to teach me.

146
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:30,680
Still running!

147
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,380
If it wasn't for me,

148
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:33,520
you'd be single as well.

149
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:37,640
Quickly! Quickly! Where are there birds?

150
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,960
Look over there! There are some up there!

151
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,400
There!

152
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,120
Aim, use your strength.

153
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,280
Pull, use your strength, fire!

154
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,540
Success!

155
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:48,890
Master is so amazing! Here, Master.

156
00:07:50,237 --> 00:07:51,560
Go bring the bird back to me!

157
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,116
Yes.

158
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,827
The future is hard to predict.

159
00:07:54,827 --> 00:07:58,260
Who would have known the two of us would laugh together one day.

160
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:00,360
Actually, I never thought that

161
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,760
we could get along.

162
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,940
Careful!

163
00:08:24,788 --> 00:08:26,600
Are you alright?

164
00:08:27,667 --> 00:08:29,840
What happened?! Who fired that arrow?!

165
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,360
4th Brother, are you alright?

166
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,520
I'm alright.

167
00:08:40,122 --> 00:08:41,720
Your servant deserves to die! Your servant deserves to die!

168
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,348
Master chased the birds here.

169
00:08:43,348 --> 00:08:45,460
Your servant should have been more careful,

170
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:46,640
but I didn't notice if people were behind

171
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,280
and didn't warn Master in time,

172
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,880
and scaring Fu'jin.

173
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,200
I...

174
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,920
Your servant deserves to die! Your servant deserves to die!

175
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,240
Why are you still standing?

176
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:55,880
Hong Shi deserves death!

177
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:58,828
Please punish me, Fujin.

178
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,400
4th Brother, don't worry,

179
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,600
it's just a child that wanted to have fun.

180
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,720
Although Fu'jin forgave you,

181
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,200
you cannot get away unpunished.

182
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,380
Why aren't you kowtowing in gratitude?

183
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:09,980
- Thank you, Fujin.
- Thank you, Fujin.

184
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:11,740
Go back and ask the house manager for punishment

185
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:13,080
Yes.

186
00:09:18,774 --> 00:09:20,167
Are you alright?

187
00:09:20,467 --> 00:09:21,886
I'm alright.

188
00:09:21,886 --> 00:09:23,420
Why is it every time I'm with you

189
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:24,640
something chaotic happens?

190
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,320
I thought that this time it would be different.

191
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,920
What are you looking at?

192
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,920
What's so surprising?

193
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:34,820
Unless,

194
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:37,559
it's that I can't joke around with Ruoxi?

195
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:40,260
You can! You can!

196
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:41,740
We are leaving now.

197
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:43,480
4th Brother, we are leaving.

198
00:09:44,581 --> 00:09:45,800
Let's go.

199
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:53,680
Are you really alright?

200
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,720
I'm alright, but...

201
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,880
What?

202
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:03,240
If you were injured, I would feel pain.

203
00:11:16,128 --> 00:11:18,240
These plum blossoms are well chosen.

204
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,400
Ruoxi, your taste is improving.

205
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,720
I really like them.

206
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,040
I don't dare accept any praise.

207
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,346
It was 14th Prince's choice.

208
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:32,640
These two branches...

209
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:35,360
Imperial Father, I've heard

210
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,640
that Imperial Grandmother really likes plum blossoms,

211
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:38,400
why don't we give this branch

212
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,080
to Ning Shou Palace?

213
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,760
Yes.

214
00:11:42,134 --> 00:11:45,280
How filial you are. Let's send this branch.

215
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,600
That branch is more upright.

216
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:50,000
We, father and son, have the same thoughts.

217
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:50,680
Li De Chuan.

218
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:51,880
Your Majesty.

219
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:54,020
Send this branch to the Dowager Empress.

220
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:54,520
Yes.

221
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,400
Come here.

222
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,880
Quick,

223
00:11:59,674 --> 00:12:02,880
look at this document for me.

224
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,480
Should I allow it or not?

225
00:12:06,949 --> 00:12:08,080
I think

226
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:11,120
it is unnecessary for the Hu Department to ask you for a ban on small amounts of money.

227
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,360
If it is advantageous to the commoners, they will obey it readily.

228
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,600
If it is not,

229
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,120
even if you enforce it,

230
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,240
it won't last long.

231
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:22,280
Everything should be convenient for the people.

232
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,800
If it is not convenient for the people

233
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,640
and has to be enforced by law,

234
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:29,400
even if we strictly banned it, what benefit would it create?

235
00:12:33,915 --> 00:12:36,440
The Emperor really likes 14th Prince.

236
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,880
Their personalities are similar

237
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,800
and so are their political ideas.

238
00:12:41,099 --> 00:12:45,696
But the 4th Prince will be the future Qing Emperor.

239
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,080
I wish Mother

240
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,320
happiness as deep as the East sea and age as long as the Southern mountains.

241
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,600
Health and happiness.

242
00:12:59,233 --> 00:13:00,760
Just now, His Majesty

243
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:03,220
sent the Dowager Empress a vase of plum blossoms.

244
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:05,080
Dowager Empress was so happy

245
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,300
and ordered someone to ask all the concubines

246
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:09,560
to admire the plum blossoms with her.

247
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:12,160
This is all part of Imperial Father's filialness.

248
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:20,040
I've heard it was 14th Prince's idea.

249
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,240
He was also the one who chose the plum flowers himself, right?

250
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:25,920
It's no wonder 14th Brother

251
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,120
is being doted on more and more by Imperial Father.

252
00:13:29,512 --> 00:13:31,400
The Emperor likes both of you.

253
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:34,580
I am so thrilled.

254
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:37,800
But the position of Crown Prince is still unoccupied.

255
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,940
For the position of heir to the throne, the princes

256
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:42,480
are always scheming against one another.

257
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,700
Initially, it was First Prince,

258
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:47,360
who was detained because he secretly cursed the Crown Prince.

259
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,560
After that, it was 13th prince being detained.

260
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:52,280
Your 14th Brother was beaten by stick.

261
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,840
Watching these scenes unfold, one after another,

262
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:58,110
really alarms me and makes me tremble in fear.

263
00:13:58,948 --> 00:14:01,756
I am really not willing to see all of you,

264
00:14:01,756 --> 00:14:03,440
because of a desire to be the heir,

265
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:07,760
plotting and harming one another.

266
00:14:08,391 --> 00:14:09,699
Your 14th Brother

267
00:14:09,699 --> 00:14:11,949
isn't the kind who schemes,

268
00:14:12,346 --> 00:14:15,061
which makes me more worried about him.

269
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:17,083
You don't have to worry,

270
00:14:17,083 --> 00:14:19,358
14th Brother knows how to handle things.

271
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:20,366
Not to mention, that now

272
00:14:20,366 --> 00:14:22,284
Imperial Father dotes on him.

273
00:14:22,284 --> 00:14:23,420
And on top of that,

274
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:25,024
with 8th Brother's help,

275
00:14:25,024 --> 00:14:27,460
I don't think any problems will arise.

276
00:14:30,868 --> 00:14:32,587
Greetings, Mother.

277
00:14:32,587 --> 00:14:35,255
Be at ease, get up, get up.

278
00:14:36,666 --> 00:14:38,088
I was just with Imperial Father

279
00:14:38,088 --> 00:14:39,181
who wanted me to look at some documents with him.

280
00:14:39,181 --> 00:14:41,599
That's why I'm late

281
00:14:41,599 --> 00:14:43,314
If you're late, you're late.

282
00:14:43,314 --> 00:14:45,218
I won't blame you.

283
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:46,633
Come.

284
00:14:48,764 --> 00:14:52,461
My wish for Mother is that you will always have a youthful countenance.

285
00:14:53,322 --> 00:14:54,251
Mother.

286
00:14:54,251 --> 00:14:56,169
These red and green jade bracelets

287
00:14:56,169 --> 00:14:57,502
were passed down from the previous dynasty.

288
00:14:57,502 --> 00:14:59,452
They are auspicious bracelets that protect the wearer.

289
00:14:59,452 --> 00:15:00,892
They ward off evil auras.

290
00:15:00,892 --> 00:15:02,492
I had to employ both kindness and severity,

291
00:15:02,492 --> 00:15:04,814
when bargaining to get them.

292
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:07,858
You rarely show this much filial piety. (joking)

293
00:15:07,858 --> 00:15:09,922
Come let me take a look.

294
00:15:19,886 --> 00:15:22,840
Looks like both you brothers

295
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:25,500
have presented me with fine bracelets.

296
00:15:25,823 --> 00:15:30,085
Whose bracelets shall I choose to wear?

297
00:15:30,085 --> 00:15:31,998
If only you two brothers

298
00:15:31,998 --> 00:15:33,600
could meet up naturally

299
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,534
and discuss what presents to give me.

300
00:15:36,534 --> 00:15:38,778
I would then

301
00:15:38,778 --> 00:15:42,036
not be placed in such a quandary, right?

302
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,301
4th Brother's heart is focused on farming the land,

303
00:15:46,301 --> 00:15:48,516
so I don't dare to disturb him.

304
00:15:48,516 --> 00:15:50,095
You two brothers,

305
00:15:50,095 --> 00:15:51,781
one is shunning the world and living like a recluse

306
00:15:51,781 --> 00:15:54,160
while the other is very socially adept.

307
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,922
Your Imperial Father extremely likes you both.

308
00:15:56,922 --> 00:15:59,683
I feel very gratified.

309
00:16:00,072 --> 00:16:02,030
Since the Crown prince has been stripped of his title,

310
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:04,731
everyone in court has been discussing the matter of succession,

311
00:16:04,731 --> 00:16:08,135
trying to figure out what your Imperial Father is thinking.

312
00:16:08,135 --> 00:16:11,225
I don't want the two of you

313
00:16:11,225 --> 00:16:15,719
to participate in the scheming and harming each other.

314
00:16:15,719 --> 00:16:17,323
Mother, don't worry.

315
00:16:17,323 --> 00:16:19,979
I am focused on farming and landscaping.

316
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:21,186
I don't ask

317
00:16:21,186 --> 00:16:22,720
about matters of the court anymore.

318
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,251
I hope that is true.

319
00:16:24,251 --> 00:16:26,520
Mother, what kind of thoughts are you thinking?

320
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:27,709
I absolutely don't

321
00:16:27,709 --> 00:16:29,729
have the ambition to make conjectures on matters regarding succession.

322
00:16:32,773 --> 00:16:36,581
A country cannot have two emperors.

323
00:16:36,581 --> 00:16:39,117
No matter what happens in the future,

324
00:16:39,117 --> 00:16:41,990
I wish that you two brothers

325
00:16:43,733 --> 00:16:46,634
will always have a brotherly bond.

326
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:58,896
Timing and Subtitles brought to you by the Bu Bu Jing Xin Team @Viki.com

327
00:17:01,675 --> 00:17:04,515
Nowadays, is 4th Brother really willingly leading a life of leisure and comfort

328
00:17:04,515 --> 00:17:06,672
or waiting for the opportune moment to strike?

329
00:17:08,369 --> 00:17:10,458
Haven't you all seen it for yourselves?

330
00:17:10,458 --> 00:17:11,959
Do I still attend court sessions?

331
00:17:11,959 --> 00:17:13,756
The expertise of 4th Brother's intelligence

332
00:17:13,756 --> 00:17:17,100
lies in plotting in secret and not openly competing.

333
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:19,065
Using the most covert methods

334
00:17:19,065 --> 00:17:21,340
to participate in the competition process.

335
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:23,541
Prying out the factual situation in the dark,

336
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:25,134
making inquiries about the real situation,

337
00:17:25,134 --> 00:17:28,685
saving up your strength to make one decisive move.

338
00:17:29,266 --> 00:17:31,589
14th brother, you have Emperor's favor now.

339
00:17:31,589 --> 00:17:32,400
Have you not thought of

340
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,342
becoming the heir to the throne?

341
00:17:34,342 --> 00:17:35,483
Are you content to remain

342
00:17:35,483 --> 00:17:37,346
only as 8th Brother's supporter?

343
00:17:38,253 --> 00:17:39,740
8th Brother was too eager in his efforts to become the heir.

344
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:41,783
But the results are like using a wicker basket to draw water.
( Idiom  meaning wasted efforts)

345
00:17:41,783 --> 00:17:43,501
You have been following 8th Brother for many years.

346
00:17:43,501 --> 00:17:46,448
There are things that I don't need to say outright.

347
00:17:46,705 --> 00:17:47,681
Although 8th Brother

348
00:17:47,681 --> 00:17:49,910
does not have Imperial Father's favor now,

349
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:51,024
in the court,

350
00:17:51,024 --> 00:17:52,325
he still has influence and power.

351
00:17:52,325 --> 00:17:54,832
If you really want to be the heir,

352
00:17:54,832 --> 00:17:57,340
he will always be your stumbling block.

353
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:58,548
My personal matters

354
00:17:58,548 --> 00:18:00,545
are none of your concern.

355
00:18:00,545 --> 00:18:02,774
Since 4th Brother is not involved with the court now,

356
00:18:02,774 --> 00:18:03,935
you shouldn't allow yourself to be

357
00:18:03,935 --> 00:18:05,907
troubled over these matters.

358
00:18:27,108 --> 00:18:28,873
You have always accompanied me wherever I went

359
00:18:28,873 --> 00:18:30,473
so I got used to it.

360
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:33,445
There was no time to get sick.

361
00:18:33,981 --> 00:18:35,467
It's so rare we get to leave the palace

362
00:18:35,467 --> 00:18:37,346
and it's all for naught.

363
00:18:38,579 --> 00:18:40,297
Take good care of yourself

364
00:18:40,297 --> 00:18:42,015
and wait for my return.

365
00:18:42,015 --> 00:18:42,991
I want to see a

366
00:18:42,991 --> 00:18:44,916
healthy and radiant you.

367
00:18:49,353 --> 00:18:50,142
Greetings, 14th Prince.

368
00:18:50,142 --> 00:18:51,420
Rise.

369
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:53,206
You may take your leave first.

370
00:18:55,963 --> 00:18:57,664
I want to give you a farewell dinner.

371
00:18:58,246 --> 00:18:59,361
The favored one of the Emperor,

372
00:18:59,361 --> 00:19:01,311
14th Prince, wants to give me a farewell dinner.

373
00:19:01,311 --> 00:19:03,237
I don't dare to accept.

374
00:19:04,469 --> 00:19:07,370
You still have the gift of eloquence.

375
00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:08,531
Do you still remember the last time

376
00:19:08,531 --> 00:19:09,810
I was in the capital?

377
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:11,689
Many years have passed by in a flash.

378
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:14,872
Did I cause you to remember

379
00:19:14,872 --> 00:19:17,029
something sad?

380
00:19:18,401 --> 00:19:21,023
Don't you remember Physician Li's advice?

381
00:19:24,624 --> 00:19:26,496
Affairs of the past,

382
00:19:26,496 --> 00:19:28,020
just let them go.

383
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:28,711
Some things

384
00:19:28,711 --> 00:19:30,080
you can do nothing about.

385
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,654
What you can do, you do.

386
00:19:32,654 --> 00:19:33,860
And there are some things

387
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:35,452
out of your control.

388
00:19:35,452 --> 00:19:36,360
So why do you

389
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:38,206
make it so hard on yourself.

390
00:19:45,367 --> 00:19:46,660
You're only nodding.

391
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:49,403
Are you really listening to what I'm saying?

392
00:19:49,403 --> 00:19:53,276
It's something I should forget, right? Alright, I got it.

393
00:19:57,527 --> 00:19:59,860
It looks quite elaborately made.

394
00:20:01,613 --> 00:20:03,300
You can have it.

395
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,186
Why are you giving this to me?

396
00:20:07,186 --> 00:20:08,800
You brothers...

397
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,380
Have some sort of resemblance to it.

398
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:12,600
Smart in many ways, full of plots and plans,

399
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,080
all for the sake of the farmer's chickens.

400
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,453
I never had such thinking as that.

401
00:20:15,453 --> 00:20:16,700
Look at you,

402
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:17,566
you're admitting that

403
00:20:17,566 --> 00:20:19,580
you're a fox.

404
00:20:34,602 --> 00:20:39,020
( Letter from her sworn sister )

405
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:48,360
( Letter from Suwan Guwalgiya Minmin )

406
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,500
Min'min

407
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,255
Min'min's relationship

408
00:21:02,255 --> 00:21:03,800
is a sincere and true one.

409
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:06,600
There's no pain of sacrifice

410
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:10,180
Perhaps that suits her best.

411
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,147
What about me?

412
00:21:13,147 --> 00:21:16,180
I can only wait for what fate has in store for me.

413
00:21:48,718 --> 00:21:50,240
Is it that my happiness?

414
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:53,340
Must I wait for fate's arrangement?

415
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:00,720
♫ Stopping here, afraid to go any further,  ♫

416
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:05,820
♫ so sorrow will be unable to make an appearance  ♫

417
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:10,580
I know I'm selfish and willful.

418
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:13,240
Can the two of us

419
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,200
have the remainders

420
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,780
of the memories of just us two?

421
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:20,180
Even if you can't marry me,

422
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:24,580
I won't let you forget me.

423
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,360
Or at least, you can't

424
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:29,340
forget me before I can forget you.

425
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:38,220
Have you memorized what I said?

426
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:44,940
♫  The fragrance of magnolia is unable to hide wounds  ♫

427
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:47,160
♫  No longer looking  ♫

428
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:51,760
♫ for the sun’s rays peeking through the clouds  ♫

429
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,720
♫  No longer looking ♫

430
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:58,000
♫ for the paradise that we promised each other  ♫

431
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,340
♫  No longer sighing  ♫

432
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:01,960
Imperial Father.

433
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:04,137
My mother's death anniversary is approaching.

434
00:23:04,137 --> 00:23:06,440
I humbly request Imperial Father's permission

435
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,380
to allow me to return first

436
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:10,860
to prepare the memorial service for my mother.

437
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:14,120
How quickly, it's been two years already.

438
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,793
Go.

439
00:23:15,793 --> 00:23:18,400
Speak to your mother on my behalf.

440
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,760
Make an early start.

441
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,740
I obey your order.

442
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:28,580
Liang'fei was not concerned with worldly affairs.

443
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:35,500
It's too bad 8th Prince is too ambitious.

444
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,960
(Tomb of Liang'fei)

445
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:58,000
Mother, I haven't been a good child.

446
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,560
When you were alive, I didn't let you

447
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:02,560
witness with your own eyes

448
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:05,414
your son accomplishing this great feat.

449
00:24:05,414 --> 00:24:06,529
I...

450
00:24:06,529 --> 00:24:08,920
have already gained the support of many ministers.

451
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:11,280
In all places, I have gained prestige and a good reputation.

452
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:13,280
Although Imperial Father refuses to give me his support,

453
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:15,420
he cannot deny it.

454
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:19,120
Even if Mother was of such a lowly background,

455
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:23,580
I will still defy the will of Heaven!

456
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:34,220
Master, you must take care of your health.

457
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:39,280
I have always been hard working,

458
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:41,080
but Mother could not wait

459
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:43,700
for the day when I become successful and accomplished my goal.

460
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:45,680
Now everything is too late.

461
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:48,560
Mistress Liang is aware, even in the afterlife,

462
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,120
and will surely understand

463
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:52,460
your true intentions.

464
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:56,220
Let's go.

465
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:03,740
Master, I've heard that with regards to the hunt,

466
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:05,660
the Emperor has made considerable catches

467
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:06,880
and is extremely delighted.

468
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,080
On the 26th, there are plans for

469
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,520
a grand feast in the palace.

470
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:12,140
Should we hurry back?

471
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:14,360
It's too late to go.

472
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:15,720
From the hot springs area,

473
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,740
I will offer my congratulations to Imperial Father.

474
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:19,880
Prince, then...

475
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,480
what gift would you like to give?

476
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:23,840
If the messenger is able to set out this very night

477
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,780
we should be able to make it.

478
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,936
We should send a gift.

479
00:25:28,936 --> 00:25:32,240
It must fit the occasion, but not be too grandiose.

480
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,300
Let me think about it carefully.

481
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:43,880
Come, sit, sit, sit...

482
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:44,920
Everybody, have a seat.

483
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:45,700
Master Liu, please.

484
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:46,260
Please... Please... Please.

485
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:48,900
When I rode and hunted in my younger days,

486
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:51,740
I wouldn't feel tired even after many hours.

487
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,362
Now I am old.

488
00:25:54,362 --> 00:25:55,520
Li'de'quan.

489
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,080
Your Majesty.

490
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,360
Do you still remember

491
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:00,600
shortly after I ascended the throne, I conducted a tour of Nan'yuan?

492
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,240
Of course, I remember.

493
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,600
That was the time when Your majesty

494
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,640
made your first official appearance.

495
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,120
I still remember the very first time

496
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,500
I shot a deer.

497
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:12,420
Time has passed in a wink of an eye.

498
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:14,440
Your Majesty.

499
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,440
8th Prince has sent a man

500
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,500
to relay his respects to the Emperor.

501
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:18,540
Send him in.

502
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:20,088
Yes.

503
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:30,280
Congratulations and Greetings, your Majesty.

504
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:31,000
Rise.

505
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,180
Thank you, your Majesty.

506
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:38,840
8th Prince offers his congratulations and greetings to the Emperor.

507
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:39,800
He has specially ordered us to

508
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,560
bring a bird from Hai'dong

509
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,840
to offer as a tribute to your Majesty.

510
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,142
He rarely shows his filialness.

511
00:26:46,142 --> 00:26:47,240
Raise it up and let me take a look.

512
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,580
Yes.

513
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,880
8th Brother's gift is a very thoughtful.

514
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,000
Not too long ago, Imperial Father

515
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,920
wrote about "Hai'dong'qin".

516
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:03,840
The poem praised that there are over three hundred and sixty types of birds.

517
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,800
Hai'dong'qin is most lively and eminent.

518
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:09,760
Its character contains a golden quality and has the virtue of fire.

519
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:14,060
Its outstanding quality could outshine the Yao'guang star...

520
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,040
- Calm down your Majesty!
- Calm down your Majesty!

521
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:37,360
- Calm down your Majesty!
- Calm down your Majesty!

522
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,220
Horrible.

523
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:53,760
3rd Prince, help me draft this edict.

524
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,300
Yes.

525
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:02,160
8th Prince

526
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:04,280
and being born of a lowly woman.

527
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:06,900
Since childhood, he has had high ambitions and a tendency for treachery.

528
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:09,040
When I last fell ill,

529
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:11,940
all the Ministers unanimously asked me to make 8th Prince

530
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:16,360
heir to the throne, trying to leave me with no choice of my own.

531
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:17,227
I had no choice

532
00:28:17,227 --> 00:28:20,485
but to release the deposed Crown Prince when I did not appoint him.

533
00:28:20,485 --> 00:28:25,540
I have been upset because of that for several years.

534
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:29,720
8th Prince still has not given up on his initial notions.

535
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:33,440
Forming a faction with confused officials and traitors.

536
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,880
Secretly forming treacherous plots.

537
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,720
I'm afraid that in the days to come,

538
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:40,000
the dogs and swine on the same path as he,

539
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,920
will make use of my kindness

540
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:44,360
and send his supporters to make things so difficult

541
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:46,160
so that  I will be forced to abdicate

542
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:48,080
and make 8th Prince the Emperor.

543
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:50,120
If that be the case

544
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:53,640
I'm afraid that I can only die without a smile on my face.

545
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,840
I am deeply angered.

546
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:59,400
I am especially pointing this out to everyone, including the princes here present.

547
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,560
Everyone should be considerate of my kindness

548
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:03,640
and follow my order

549
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:06,900
as the path, be you a son or a Minister.

550
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:09,880
Since the Emperor's words

551
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,520
are stated in black and white,

552
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:12,760
he won't even give a chance

553
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:14,480
to listen to any of 8th Prince's explanation.

554
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,460
Once this Imperial edict is passed, it will destroy

555
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:18,940
all of 8th Prince's chances of finding a way out of this situation.

556
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:22,580
His dream of being Emperor has been crushed.

557
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:25,300
Thoroughly and utterly crushed.

558
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:27,420
The Ministers here,

559
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:29,740
who were once full of praises for 8th Prince

560
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:31,780
have pushed him to the edge of a precipice.

561
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:33,780
Now, no one

562
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:36,040
will even dare speak on his behalf.

563
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:42,660
Sister, you still have brothers and sisters by your side.

564
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:45,920
They're not princes or royal grandsons.

565
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:48,784
If you make a move

566
00:29:48,784 --> 00:29:51,580
it'll cause His Majesty to hate 8th Brother-in-law even more

567
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:52,780
and even suspect that you

568
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:54,540
were placed by his side by 8th Prince.

569
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:56,980
A pawn who spies on the Emperor day and night.

570
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:59,800
That offense alone will cause heads roll.

571
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:14,080
Timing and Subtitles brought to you by the Bu Bu Jing Xin Team @Viki.com

572
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:20,160
Greetings Imperial Father.

573
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:28,780
Where is 8th Prince?

574
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:29,660
Imperial Father,

575
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:31,340
8th Brother has fallen ill at the hot springs.

576
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:32,860
I've already sent men to take a look.

577
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:34,380
But they have all been rebuffed.

578
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:36,020
The remaining attendants have dispersed

579
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:37,580
and only the usual servants remain.

580
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:39,180
They are now on the way back to the capital.

581
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:40,700
14th Prince,

582
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:42,460
did you also send anyone to look?

583
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:44,060
I sent men to visit him

584
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:46,000
8th Brother refuses to see them.

585
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,020
He has a hidden agenda.

586
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:50,340
His location is secretive.

587
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:51,900
I'm worried.

588
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:53,220
Bring him back here!

589
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:54,600
Yes.

590
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:33,780
Beile-ye, you must've had a rough journey.

591
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:35,360
8th Brother.

592
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:39,660
14th Brother, you can go back first.

593
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:40,660
14th Brother-in-law,

594
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:41,980
you must be tired too.

595
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:44,100
You should go home and get some rest first.

596
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:45,300
If there's anything else,

597
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:46,980
wait to talk about it after you've gotten some rest.

598
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:49,920
Looks like your 8th Brother is also exhausted.

599
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:54,100
Alright, I'll leave first then.

600
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:57,040
8th Brother, get a good rest.

601
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,660
Beile-ye, get some rest first.

602
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:13,740
Don't think about anything.

603
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:15,680
Ming'hui,

604
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:19,360
in what aspect, was I not careful?

605
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:23,009
Who was unworthy of my trust?

606
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,280
I also have no idea.

607
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:29,960
But for now,

608
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:32,204
the situation has not been settled.

609
00:32:32,204 --> 00:32:34,720
Bei'le'ye still has a chance to make a return.

610
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,000
Is it him?

611
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:40,000
Did he betray me?

612
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:42,583
Whether or not it's 14th Brother-in-law,

613
00:32:42,583 --> 00:32:45,080
the truth of the matter will come to light one day.

614
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:49,200
I blame myself for being too smart for my own good.

615
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,880
Heir to the throne.

616
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:54,356
Who wouldn't be tempted?

617
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:59,640
Why didn't I raise my guard against people around me? Such a simple principle and I didn't even take precautions.

618
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:06,960
I was just asking for this outcome.

619
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:09,280
Beile-ye...

620
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,480
I want to be alone.

621
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,760
You go in first.

622
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,000
Sister.

623
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Do you suspect that 14th Prince is the culprit?

624
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,400
I don't know either.

625
00:33:56,005 --> 00:33:59,800
Today, 14th Prince is close to the Emperor

626
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,620
and 8th Prince has been crushed.

627
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:03,760
This indeed benefits him.

628
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:06,040
Those who originally had been supporting the 8th Prince

629
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:08,240
are now changing their allegiance to him.

630
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:11,160
Because of this, he has to cut all brotherly ties.

631
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:13,120
It's not impossible.

632
00:34:14,439 --> 00:34:15,800
Since matters have come to this stage,

633
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:19,480
if Jie'jie keeps thinking about it what good can come out of it?

634
00:34:19,967 --> 00:34:21,520
That's right.

635
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,920
What good can come out of thinking about this matter?

636
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,719
The people involved...

637
00:34:25,719 --> 00:34:29,280
Eunuchs and attendants have all committed suicide.

638
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,920
Where would I go to find evidence or witnesses?

639
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,080
But I'm not willing to resign myself from it.

640
00:34:35,409 --> 00:34:39,600
I want to see how really cruel this palace can be.

641
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:46,420
Greetings 14th Prince.

642
00:34:46,972 --> 00:34:48,600
Greetings 14th Prince.

643
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:49,960
Rise.

644
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:51,840
Yutan, go out.

645
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,400
Yes.

646
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:59,600
What complaints you have, we can talk about it face-to-face.

647
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:02,600
Do you hate me for not pleading for 8th Brother?

648
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,120
Why would I blame you for something

649
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:05,800
I didn't even do myself?

650
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,840
Does this look like you're not blaming me?

651
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:12,080
All right. I indeed don't understand.

652
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:14,120
The year when the Crown prince was stripped of his title,

653
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:16,040
14th Pince once pleaded for mercy for the 8th Prince.

654
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:18,160
You didn't care about the threat of death and held on to the Emperor

655
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,560
until the Emperor took a sword and almost gave into killing you.

656
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,520
14th Prince, you were without any fear,

657
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:23,640
but this time...

658
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:25,448
14th Prince, even until now

659
00:35:25,448 --> 00:35:27,120
you haven't said one word.

660
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:28,280
What did I do at that time?

661
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:30,360
In the end, I didn't really save 8th Brother.

662
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,720
Because of my impulsiveness

663
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:33,680
the Emperor became even more fearful of 8th Brother.

664
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,960
He thinks that us brothers don't respect him as a father.

665
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,560
That we are rebelling against him under 8th Brother's leadership.

666
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:40,440
Imperial Father has become more wary of 8th Brother and that he will send his supporters to make trouble for him.

667
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:42,200
Forcing him to abdicate.

668
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,880
Six years have passed.

669
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,840
Am I to make the same mistake twice

670
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:49,680
and continue being rash and reckless without sparing a thought for the consequences?!

671
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:50,520
Besides,

672
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:54,080
the situation this time around is totally different from the previous one.

673
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:56,080
Last time, when Imperial Father punished 8th Brother,

674
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:58,800
it was because many Ministers' recommended making him the heir which infuriated him.

675
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,000
8th Brother hadn't done anything wrong.

676
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:04,320
But this time, it's because of him not being filial.

677
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,560
It's a serious offense to curse Imperial Father.

678
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,800
Are you telling me even you believe that it's 8th Prince who really did that?

679
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:09,800
Of course not.

680
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:12,961
The guard and eunuch who delivered the bird have both committed suicide.

681
00:36:12,961 --> 00:36:14,440
Imperial Father is very astute.

682
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:17,040
Can't he tell if there is something fishy about this matter?

683
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:21,080
8th Brother has always been the person that Imperial Father has feared the most.

684
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,280
All these years

685
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:26,240
Imperial Father has tried to think of ways and means to weaken 8th Brother's influence in the court.

686
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:28,960
But 8th Brother's power and influence keeps growing.

687
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:31,840
It has directly and indirectly affected Imperial Father's own power.

688
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:34,240
With the matter of the dead bird,

689
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:38,320
you could say it's the best chance for him to strike a blow against 8th Brother.

690
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:45,720
The virtue of filial piety is most important.

691
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:49,840
If this basic human kindness, 8th Prince cannot even accomplish,

692
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:54,400
his reputation as Ba'xian'wang, will be in shreds.
(Eighth virtuous king)

693
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:59,440
How could the officials continue to support a person who curses his own father.

694
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:06,520
The royal family is cruel.

695
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:08,900
It's no wonder 8th Pince has not refuted the accusations.

696
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:12,040
He just fell sick without a sound

697
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,160
because he knows

698
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:15,900
whether he really did it

699
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,240
or not isn't important in the Emperor's eyes.

700
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:20,440
If the Emperor thinks that he did it,

701
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:22,480
then he did it.

702
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:26,560
If the Emperor treats his own son like this

703
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,840
then from now for a thousand years,

704
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:32,040
his name is already blackened.

705
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:37,040
A lifetime of work leaking out like water.

706
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:43,200
Imperial Father hardened his heart so that he could issue the edict.

707
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,760
He is making sure that 8th Brother cannot question an Emperor's authority.

708
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,960
Looking at the situation now,

709
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,880
I must consider the big picture.

710
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,000
Only by protecting myself,

711
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,040
can I protect 8th Brother.

712
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,920
Or else we'll both lose out.

713
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:59,360
We will have no chance of standing up for ourselves.

714
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,960
Everything has been formulated and planned.

715
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:03,000
8th Brother's many years of effort

716
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,160
has been lost.

717
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,600
The falcon that Eighth Prince sent,

718
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:11,160
why should it have died?

719
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:14,820
When it was sent out,
it should have definitely been fine.

720
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:17,720
Something must have happened along the road.

721
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:22,005
The servants sent out must have been with the 8th Prince for many years.

722
00:38:22,005 --> 00:38:24,560
People he deeply trusted.

723
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:30,620
Who arranged for these people to be by 8th Prince's side

724
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:33,840
so that these eunuchs could do such a huge thing?

725
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:38,240
And who is the one that will have the most to benefit from this matter?

726
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:40,440
I've explained so much to you!

727
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:42,960
You are not mad because I didn't plead on behalf of 8th Brother,

728
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,396
you're suspecting me!

729
00:38:44,396 --> 00:38:46,560
You have made up your mind that it was I who gave up our brotherly ties

730
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,420
to do something so despicable!

731
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:52,120
Ruoxi, I misjudged you!

732
00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:00,440
Are you acting

733
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:03,720
or really disappointed and angry?

734
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:37,120
You must be the one who set up 8th Brother!

735
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:38,920
What do you mean?

736
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:40,400
The Crown Prince is under confinement.

737
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:43,280
The relationship between 8th Brother and Imperial Father has been severed.

738
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,720
The one who benefits most from this is who?

739
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:49,320
Looking at your flustered manner,

740
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:51,400
are you being suspected?

741
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:55,320
So you want to find the real culprit in order to clear your name?

742
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:56,880
Besides clearing my name,

743
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:59,560
I want justice for 8th Brother!

744
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:01,080
You're taking revenge for 13th brother

745
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:05,364
and that's why you are using utterly heartless methods to frame 8th Brother!

746
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,960
Utterly heartless?

747
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:21,400
The innocent party knows his conscience is clear.

748
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,200
Are you talking about me or yourself?

749
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:28,080
In regards to this matter, whether I have gained or lost is still not known.

750
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:29,520
But you are different.

751
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:32,720
8th Brother's many years of painstaking effort to build up everything,

752
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:34,240
isn't that all yours now?

753
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:36,960
I am not a person who would betray my kin

754
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:39,240
or behave worst than a beast.

755
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:42,160
Then that's good.

756
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:53,040
Your son wishes Imperial Father,

757
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:55,220
that the sky, earth, sun, and stars are all at peace.

758
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:57,720
That the people, family, and everything is harmonious.

759
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:00,340
Your son wishes Imperial Father, that sky, earth, and the people are harmonious.

760
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:02,800
Your son wishes Imperial Father, ten thousand years of boundless longevity.

761
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:09,680
Your son wishes Imperial Father a happy new year.

762
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:12,006
Your son wishes Imperial Father, that everything goes smoothly.

763
00:41:12,006 --> 00:41:15,840
Your son wishes Imperial Father and the fate of our Qing Dynasty to be prosperous.

764
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:29,480
Your daughter-in-law on behalf of the 8th prince wishes Imperial Father a happy new year

765
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:31,440
I wish Imperial Father that all your wishes be fulfilled

766
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,080
and a happy new year.

767
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:34,120
Rise.

768
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:36,080
Thank You, Imperial Father-in-law.

769
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:40,520
The 8th Prince intended to come and wish his Imperial Father a happy new year,

770
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:44,200
however, the Royal Physician said that walking is not beneficial to 8th Prince.

771
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:46,340
I understand.

772
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:48,520
Thank You, Imperial Father-in-law.

773
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:54,320
Today is the new year.  Everyone could be more at ease.

774
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:57,200
No need to emphasize the formalities between Emperor and Minsters.

775
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,600
Li'de'quan.

776
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:00,960
Yes.

777
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:08,760
This is the manuscript written by the Emperor.

778
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:12,720
A new year gift to all the Princes.

779
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:15,660
Your sons thank Imperial Father.

780
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:18,320
Everybody open it and look.

781
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:31,880
[ "Stay home and think about your mistakes" ]

782
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:48,520
8th Sister-in-law. Let me see what is written on your paper.

783
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:51,240
10th Brother, why don't you take a look at mine first?

784
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:53,480
See?

785
00:42:56,520 --> 00:43:00,800
10th brother, let 8th Sister-in-law see what yours says too.

786
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:09,320
One should maintain harmony.  Good

787
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:13,840
You and Ming'yu should understand Imperial Father's hopes for you.

788
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:19,080
Everyone is in harmony and good luck will come.

789
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:24,160
I admire with my whole heart, the lady who fights for 8th Prince all alone.

790
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:26,780
She could have avoided all of this

791
00:43:26,780 --> 00:43:28,440
but she came with a smile

792
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:29,720
and remains well-mannered.

793
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:32,040
No one can be nit-pick at anything.

794
00:43:32,540 --> 00:43:36,180
She has turned all the mockeries into jests.

795
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:40,160
Well-done...  Well-done.

796
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:50,000
8th Fujin, please wait.

797
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,480
Greetings, Fujin.

798
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:55,800
Rise.

799
00:43:56,620 --> 00:43:58,360
What's wrong?

800
00:43:59,020 --> 00:44:01,740
If you want to know about your sister,

801
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:03,200
she's doing very well.

802
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:06,900
Just now... I was very impressed with you.

803
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:08,920
Facing all kinds of glances, you

804
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:11,880
still remained well-mannered and appropriate.

805
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:17,500
Since there's nothing more to lose,

806
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:19,160
what else is there to be afraid of?

807
00:44:20,180 --> 00:44:23,160
The only thing I can do for Bei'le'ye

808
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:25,720
is to protect his dignity.

809
00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:29,060
I want to let everyone know,

810
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:32,100
that we don't need anyone's pity

811
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:34,700
and we will not allow anyone to look down on us.

812
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:38,820
This is not something just any woman can do.

813
00:44:39,820 --> 00:44:42,260
You can do it too,

814
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:47,460
if the Prince still has a place in your heart.

815
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:54,660
Is Eighth Prince's health any better?

816
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:14,540
Your appetite is better today,

817
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:16,580
so eat some more.

818
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:20,560
You had to take care of everything for during the Spring Festival.

819
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:21,320
It's been hard on you.

820
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:22,920
Not at all.

821
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:25,400
When I see you getting better each day,

822
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:27,080
I'll be happy.

823
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:29,560
Master.

824
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:32,100
What are you so flustered about?

825
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:34,040
I just found out,

826
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:36,440
the Emperor just ordered

827
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:39,400
your salary and rice pension to be stopped.

828
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:43,240
Alright, dismissed.

829
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:44,880
Yes.

830
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:47,360
What is this?

831
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:50,120
This is too much punishment.

832
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:53,240
How can the Emperor do this?

833
00:45:56,080 --> 00:46:00,080
It's already been 2 months since the situation occurred.

834
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:04,400
The order from Imperial Father is just letting everyone to know clearly

835
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:07,440
that he will not forgive me.

836
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:12,080
It is to give those who still want to wait and see, and any Ministers who still support me

837
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:14,960
a clear warning.

838
00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:19,500
We don't need his charity.

839
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:22,080
All of our savings together can support eight life-spans.

840
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:23,440
Even if we ate it all,

841
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:25,360
there's still my father.

842
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:28,080
Even if my father doesn't care for us,

843
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:31,080
you will still have me.

844
00:46:46,130 --> 00:46:50,780
♫  Stopping here, afraid to go any further ♫

845
00:46:52,110 --> 00:46:56,850
♫ so sorrow will be unable to make an appearance  ♫

846
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:04,010
♫  On the next page, the farewell penned by you,  ♫

847
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:09,510
♫  it was not up to me to refuse  ♫

848
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:16,950
♫  We’ve walked down this path too hastily  ♫

849
00:47:17,980 --> 00:47:23,910
♫  Embracing desires that weren’t realistic  ♫

850
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:30,080
♫  Not in time, wasn’t able to wait long enough to look back and admire  ♫

851
00:47:31,030 --> 00:47:35,480
♫  The fragrance of magnolia is unable to hide wounds  ♫

852
00:47:36,330 --> 00:47:42,250
♫  No longer looking for the sun’s rays peeking through the clouds  ♫

853
00:47:42,620 --> 00:47:48,840
♫  No longer looking for the paradise that we promised each other  ♫

854
00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:55,110
♫  No longer sighing, you once said that life is unpredictable  ♫

855
00:47:55,690 --> 00:48:03,240
♫  The three inches of sunlight that I was unable to borrow  ♫

856
00:48:05,330 --> 00:48:11,580
♫  No longer looking for the sunlight peeking through the clouds  ♫

857
00:48:12,110 --> 00:48:17,930
♫  No longer looking for the paradise that we promised each other  ♫

858
00:48:18,510 --> 00:48:24,460
♫  No longer sighing, you once said that life is unpredictable  ♫

859
00:48:24,970 --> 00:48:30,600
♫  The three inches of sunlight that I was unable to borrow  ♫

860
00:48:31,470 --> 00:48:39,340
♫  That paradise is the place where I’d loved you  ♫
