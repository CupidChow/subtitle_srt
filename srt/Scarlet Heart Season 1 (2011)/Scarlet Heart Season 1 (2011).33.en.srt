00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:20,690
♫  In the blink of an eye, a thought of stubborn persistence  ♫

3
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:24,480
♫  We were destined to seek our doom like moths flying towards the flame  ♫

4
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:31,280
♫  Knowing that it’d be a disaster, why am I still at a loss about what to do  ♫

5
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:39,120
♫  The best is not to see, the best is not to miss you  ♫

6
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:44,250
♫  Only like this can I not be in love with you  ♫

7
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:48,880
♫  Just another brushing of the shoulder, and from then...♫

8
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:54,090
♫  I’ll keep falling deeper and deeper in love with you  ♫

9
00:00:55,570 --> 00:01:02,360
♫  It’s the mistake of time, ♫
♫ forcing us to pass each other by  ♫

10
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:05,400
♫  How I miss you, how far you are  ♫

11
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:12,220
♫  Even though I’d known it’d only result in pain,  ♫
♫ at this moment, I still don’t want to escape   ♫

12
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:16,790

00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:25,340
♫  Don’t want to escape  ♫

15

♫  It’s the mistake of time,  ♫
♫  we can only pass each other by  ♫

16
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:35,150
♫  The magnitude of me missing you is as much as how far you are   ♫

17
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:41,920
♫  Even though I know the ending is a mistake that I cannot oppose  ♫

18

♫  Staying in this moment  ♫

19
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:55,180
♫  We can only accept that the feelings run deep, but fate is shallow  ♫

Scarlet Heart
Episode 33

21
00:02:02,935 --> 00:02:04,536
On the surface,

22
00:02:04,536 --> 00:02:07,340
it looked as if the 8th Prince and others were against you.

23
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:09,714
But the actual initiator,

24
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:11,980
directly and indirectly,

25
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:15,200
that caused all this was me!

26
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,720
The person you love the most.

27
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:24,648
These past years, you were hating the wrong person!

28
00:02:24,648 --> 00:02:26,160
Shut up!

29
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,236
It was me.

30
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:34,520
I hurt you and harmed you. The person that caused all this was me.

31
00:02:37,851 --> 00:02:40,160
The person you should hate

32
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,172
is standing in front of you right now.

33
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:49,390
Get out.

34
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:54,598
All of you get out.

35
00:02:57,301 --> 00:02:58,910
Get out!

36
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:09,777
Ruoxi...

37
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:28,302
Ruoxi! Ruoxi!

38
00:04:28,302 --> 00:04:30,200
Are you alright, Ruoxi?

39
00:04:50,934 --> 00:04:52,681
Second Miss.

40
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:56,537
Second Miss, quickly come back.

41
00:04:56,537 --> 00:04:59,020
Come back with me, then you can meet Madame.

42
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:02,876
Second Miss, come back quickly. Come back quickly.

43
00:05:02,876 --> 00:05:04,632
Come back quickly.

44
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:08,800
I have nothing left.

45
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,162
I don't have Older Sister and Yutan.

46
00:05:12,162 --> 00:05:14,880
I've lost my child. I've lost my friend.

47
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,640
I've also lost my 4th Prince.

48
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:20,205
I have nothing left now.

49
00:05:20,679 --> 00:05:21,884
Ruoxi...

50
00:05:22,709 --> 00:05:24,206
Ruoxi.

51
00:05:29,856 --> 00:05:31,540
You've finally awakened.

52
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:36,838
Ruoxi, how could you be so silly?

53
00:05:38,033 --> 00:05:40,740
I don't blame you at all.

54
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,682
You were not at fault at all.

55
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,680
If there is to be hatred,

56
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,600
I can just hate the destiny that made a fool of us.

57
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:53,340
Rouxi, promise me...

58
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:54,960
you won't give up

59
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,940
and you shouldn't give up.

60
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,420
Don't be in a hurry.

61
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:05,520
If you have something to say, just wait until you're better.

62
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,400
You've slept for several days

63
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,280
and your fever never went down.

64
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,740
Your voice will be better in a few days.

65
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:26,280
I'm... very happy.

66
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,020
Happy?

67
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,380
We are such close friends.

68
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:36,580
To have a friend like you,

69
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:38,560
I am also very happy.

70
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,160
Do you have some words

71
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,480
you want me to pass on to 14th?

72
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,900
What do you mean by that?

73
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:28,100
I... agree...

74
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:30,440
You agree?

75
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,760
What do you mean?

76
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:43,180
Fine, I will deliver the message to him.

77
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:45,180
But I need your promise

78
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:46,960
that you will never give up.

79
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:53,400
Fine, then I'm off now.

80
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,960
Have a good rest.

81
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:06,240
What?

82
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,680
What did you say Ruoxi said?

83
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,960
She said, "I agree".

84
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,480
Agree?

85
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,120
14th Brother,

86
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,800
what is this about?

87
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:27,900
Tell me.

88
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:31,200
What do her words mean?

89
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:35,280
This I will tell you...

90
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:40,280
Everything is for the good of Ruoxi,

91
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,780
so stop asking,

92
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:45,000
just respect her decision.

93
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,680
Your Majesty...

94
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:10,020
You've not gone to see Ruoxi for a long time.

95
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:12,520
Why torture yourself like this?

96
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,360
The deeper the love, the greater the hate.

97
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:20,760
Because she warned 8th Brother to beware of me at that time,

98
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,360
how can I not be angry?

99
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,740
But at that time,

100
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:29,280
she still hadn't developed feelings for you yet.

101
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,800
So how is she to blame?

102
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:37,280
What had I done in those years

103
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,540
that she should forewarn 8th brother?

104
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,400
It is quite a puzzle for me.

105
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:47,440
Your Majesty, your talent so exceeds others,

106
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,480
that others will inevitably be jealous.

107
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,160
Moreover,

108
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:54,960
Ruoxi was the sister-in-law of the 8th Prince and lived in Beilei's residence.

109
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:58,680
Of course, they would be of the same heart.

110
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,040
Then again,

111
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:02,000
how did she know back then

112
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,040
that the one to rule the world would be Your Majesty?

113
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:08,840
About the miscarriage,

114
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,720
to Ruoxi

115
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,760
that must have been like the pain that erodes her bones.

116
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:21,640
Your Majesty, just like what your 13th Brother  said,

117
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,520
your Majesty should be understanding of her.

118
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,960
Understand her honesty and her sincerity.

119
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:28,960
I know that she is sincere,

120
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:31,180
but to save them,

121
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:33,360
she decided to hurt me like this.

122
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,200
Everything I've done for her, she did not understand at all.

123
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,480
She did not understand.

124
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,280
Qiaohui,

125
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:12,360
these days have been difficult for you.

126
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,300
Being here with me,

127
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:18,040
you always have to be on your toes too.

128
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,720
Ever since you were young,

129
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:24,620
you've never had to suffer such punishment as this.

130
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:26,840
What kind of words are those, Second Miss?

131
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:31,600
Being able to serve Second Miss is my eternal good fortune.

132
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,360
Look!

133
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,880
The sky outside of here

134
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:44,080
is the real sky.

135
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:53,720
Being here in the Palace,

136
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:57,760
I have always just been a passerby.

137
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:25,780
Your Majesty, as your brother, I have come today

138
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:28,460
to ask your Majesty for your consent in a matter.

139
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,820
What is it?

140
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:33,760
I ask your Majesty to bestow a marriage.

141
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,800
Bestow a marriage?  What marriage?

142
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,920
The one that was granted by our Divine Imperial Father,

143
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:43,880
to allow me to bestow on Maertai Ruoxi the title of Ce Fu'jin.

144
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:49,060
I have here, the Imperial decree from Imperial Father.

145
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:41,380
I request your Majesty to sanction this marriage.

146
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:49,420
I have important things to discuss with the Ministers today,

147
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,500
leave for now.

148
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:58,240
Thank you, Your Majesty.

149
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:07,460
I understand it now.

150
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:12,260
This is the reward that the previous Emperor gave to the 14th Prince for winning the battle so many years before.

151
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:13,720
Ruoxi...

152
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:16,740
how can this happen?

153
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:21,360
Do you know how angry Imperial Brother was when he received that Imperial decree

154
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,320
at court today?

155
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:32,600
What do you think he's going to do?

156
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,960
If Imperial Brother can make 8th Brother divorce his Fujin,

157
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:43,340
he can definitely make 14th Brother unable to marry you.

158
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:48,040
The crime of not obeying an Imperial decree of the Divine Imperial Emperor

159
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,800
is very serious.

160
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,620
If His Majesty insists on doing so,

161
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:56,480
it will be not only a cause for gossip to others,

162
00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:00,280
but if he actually dares to disobey this posthumous Imperial decree,

163
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:03,240
then with any other posthumous Imperial decree, he can also--

164
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,840
Rouxi!

165
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:18,160
Imperial Brother is acting this way

166
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,560
because he really cares about you.

167
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:26,500
Ruoxi, is it really impossible

168
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:29,680
for everything to go back to its' place?

169
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:35,080
It is impossible to go back to the past.

170
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:42,040
Yutan has died. The child is gone.

171
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:46,000
You were in solitary confinement for ten years.

172
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:50,200
Ever since the 51st Year of the Kangxi Reign, His Majesty

173
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:53,920
has lived being cautious and compromising.

174
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,800
All this stands between us

175
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:03,020
and we can not pretend that none of it happened.

176
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:08,800
Right now, I just want to leave here.

177
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:12,300
Do you really insist on doing so?

178
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,160
If on that day,

179
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,720
I had known the meaning of "I agree",

180
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:35,560
and if I I had known 14th Brother had that Imperial decree,

181
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:40,460
I would not have consented to help you so easily.

182
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,960
I'm sorry,

183
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,040
I did not expect this either.

184
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,120
I just thought

185
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,920
14th Prince had a way to help me leave this Palace.

186
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,280
You didn't know?

187
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:00,480
However, if this is the only way,

188
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,920
I am willing to do it.

189
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,600
Ruoxi,

190
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:10,720
are you really willing to marry 14th Brother?

191
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:15,720
I really want to leave the Palace.

192
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:22,499
I trust that the 14th prince will not force me (to consummate the marriage).

193
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,640
I'll marry him

194
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:27,680
in name only.

195
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,839
In name only?

196
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:47,400
Greetings, Imperial Brother.

197
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:52,560
About Ruoxi,

198
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:56,280
were you the one who notified 14th Brother?

199
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,440
Yes.

200
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:04,640
At the time,

201
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:07,600
I never imagined the result to be like this.

202
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:10,060
I promised Ruoxi,

203
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:12,880
so that she could regain the will to live.

204
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:17,440
Is she really not willing to live in the Palace anymore?

205
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:24,980
As for Ruoxi,

206
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:29,140
maybe, she really doesn't belong here.

207
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:32,000
She has a mind unlike any other.

208
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,520
What do you mean, a mind unlike others?

209
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:38,360
What? Is she from some era other than ours?

210
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:44,040
Truthfully, I am not Ruoxi,

211
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,800
I am Zhang Xiao.

212
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:49,760
I am not from your time period.

213
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:55,520
She said she's not...

214
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,040
But it can't be.

215
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,500
It really can't be.

216
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:11,340
So what if she isn't from our time period?

217
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:14,560
Is there a difference?

218
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,400
Ruoxi.

219
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,960
All along,

220
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,000
I've treated you as a little sister,

221
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,960
you may speak your mind.

222
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,840
You and His Majesty experienced many hardships,

223
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,880
before you could finally be together.

224
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,780
Why not step back a little?

225
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:57,880
When staying together for a lifetime,

226
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:02,520
it's not so easy to do what you want.

227
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:05,240
Why not?

228
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:08,180
Your Majesty knows as well that

229
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:12,240
two people being in love is not just a matter between the two people.

230
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,200
Also, the Emperor is the ruler of the Empire.

231
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,020
No matter how pure and easy love is

232
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:18,920
it is never a simple matter,

233
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:23,000
it might even take a person's life.

234
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,640
Lately, the Emperor has been worrying over your matter.

235
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,840
Just seeing him so, makes me feel bad.

236
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,000
You love His Majesty so much,

237
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:41,560
why not just let it go, for the Emperor's sake?

238
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:44,080
I don't want to harm anyone,

239
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:47,000
but someone always gets hurt because of me.

240
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:51,440
I cannot accept that.

241
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,960
Can you really bear to leave the Emperor?

242
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:02,200
Can you truly let all those feelings of these past years go?

243
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,440
I can't...

244
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:08,080
but I still have to.

245
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:12,420
Rouxi, you have to think about it more carefully.

246
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:16,640
After you think about it thoroughly, then decide for sure.

247
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,320
Lady Ruoxi.

248
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,520
Your health is a lot better.

249
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,080
Just two more treatments

250
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,680
and you can stop.

251
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,640
Thank you for all your trouble.

252
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,040
I would like to ask,

253
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,660
my health as it is now,

254
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:36,220
what condition is it in?

255
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:38,280
You have already recovered.

256
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:42,360
From now forward, you just need to nourish yourself and take care.

257
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:44,020
Do you remember

258
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:47,320
what you said when you first treated me back then?

259
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:50,140
"If Ruoxi thoroughly follows treatment

260
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:52,040
I can guarantee 10 years without problems."

261
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:54,240
What about now?

262
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:56,360
I...

263
00:21:57,620 --> 00:22:00,320
Imperial Doctor, please tell me the truth

264
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:08,240
Time has passed, it's been more than a year.

265
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:12,200
There should be at least 8 more years.

266
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,560
But as of right now,

267
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,360
I can only say that

268
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:19,120
if everything goes well,

269
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:23,600
there are only 3 to 4 years left.

270
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,860
Please don't blame yourself.

271
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:32,480
I am really a very disobedient patient.

272
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:36,040
Does the Emperor know of this?

273
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:38,840
He has never asked about this,

274
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:42,080
so I've never dared to say anything either.

275
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:45,840
Thank you, Imperial Physician, for your attentive treatment this past year.

276
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,200
Or else...

277
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,260
This is my duty.

278
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:53,160
I hate myself for not being skillful enough

279
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:55,840
to be able to cure the root of your problem.

280
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:58,760
I will take my leave.

281
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:06,780
Second Miss,

282
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:08,520
what kind of a place is this?

283
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:11,180
How can someone always so healthy end up like this?

284
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:13,820
It's all right, I am fine.

285
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:15,460
Second Miss and Madame are the same.

286
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:17,300
You both loved freedom.

287
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:19,480
It's still better to leave this Palace.

288
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:23,280
About the conflicts in Xibei,

289
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:27,200
I appoint Nian Gengyao as the General

290
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,540
to neutralize the rebels.

291
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:30,860
I will have to trouble all of you to

292
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:33,120
think of a solution regarding the army's rations.

293
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:35,220
Also,

294
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:39,440
I confer Duke Longkodo to the Ministry of Appointments, Commander of the Army, and head of the Bureau of Tributary Affairs.

295
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,560
I also bestow upon him the title of Teacher to the Crown Prince.

296
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:45,520
Also, last time, I mentioned abolishing low caste status,

297
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,680
reforming taxes, and establishing a labor system not based on population but based on farmland measurements.

298
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:52,000
Regarding this, if anyone has any opinion, you may voice it.

299
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:58,040
Lian Qinwang, do you have anything to say?
(Lian - his name/Qinwang - Princely title)

300
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,920
Matters of the Court are handled by Your Majesty,

301
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:06,820
I have no opinions.

302
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:08,520
That's rare.

303
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:11,620
In that case, court is dismissed.

304
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:13,100
I have something

305
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:15,520
I would like to speak to Your Majesty about privately.

306
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,740
What is there that you can't say it now?

307
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:20,200
It is a family matter.

308
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:27,720
Those below Lian Qinwang, you may leave.

309
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,877
Yes.

310
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:37,960
Yi Qinwang, you may leave as well.

311
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:40,000
Yes.

312
00:24:57,868 --> 00:24:59,400
Speak.

313
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,360
I...

314
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:05,800
wish to be straightforward with Your Majesty today,

315
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:10,040
concerning the relationship I had with Ruoxi many years back.

316
00:25:10,453 --> 00:25:12,300
At that time,

317
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:15,080
when I first met Ruoxi in my manor,

318
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:17,108
my eyes lit up.

319
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:19,480
Toward Ruoxi,

320
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:22,080
you could say that it was love at first sight.

321
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,562
Because of Ruolan,

322
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:28,160
I've always hidden my feelings for Ruoxi.

323
00:25:28,625 --> 00:25:30,760
But repressed feelings,

324
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:33,169
will only become even stronger.

325
00:25:33,169 --> 00:25:34,477
Go straight to the point.

326
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:37,680
Just before Ruoxi entered the Palace,

327
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:40,560
I gave her a bracelet and confessed to her.

328
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:45,160
She did not accept me then.

329
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:48,105
It wasn't until we went on the excursion

330
00:25:48,105 --> 00:25:49,920
with Imperial Father.

331
00:25:50,895 --> 00:25:53,400
Princess Minmin was teaching  Ruoxi how to ride a horse,

332
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,840
but she nearly got trampled by the horse.

333
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,418
I saved her in time.

334
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:59,740
That day,

335
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,460
when I carried her in my arms

336
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:04,380
and sent her back to the camp,

337
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,680
she finally accepted me.

338
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:10,400
Since that day,

339
00:26:10,746 --> 00:26:12,840
I taught her horseback riding every day,

340
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:15,233
brought her to ride in the grasslands,

341
00:26:15,233 --> 00:26:19,440
gave her jasmine flowers, carried her in my arms.

342
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,177
From her,

343
00:26:21,177 --> 00:26:24,500
I could smell the scent of the jasmine flowers.

344
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:27,859
We also held hands in the grasslands

345
00:26:27,859 --> 00:26:29,531
and strolled along as the sun went down.

346
00:26:30,135 --> 00:26:33,520
We admired the stars and moon together,

347
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,729
hugged and kissed

348
00:26:35,729 --> 00:26:37,840
each other.

349
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:42,560
We vowed to live and die together, to have a family together.

350
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:46,720
To teach our children and grow old with them.

351
00:26:56,466 --> 00:26:58,067
Are you done?

352
00:26:58,067 --> 00:26:59,971
Almost.

353
00:26:59,971 --> 00:27:01,421
I understand.

354
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,175
Leave.

355
00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:10,538
I'll take my leave.

356
00:28:16,229 --> 00:28:18,108
Greetings, Your Majesty.

357
00:28:19,649 --> 00:28:20,940
Leave.

358
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,936
I finally understand

359
00:29:41,655 --> 00:29:44,520
why you could never let go of 8th.

360
00:29:50,446 --> 00:29:53,268
I understand why you warned him

361
00:29:53,268 --> 00:29:54,819
take precautions against me.

362
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:02,760
When he was kneeling in the hall,

363
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:07,683
you were accompanying him in the temple.

364
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:15,500
Was it 9th who told you this?

365
00:30:22,397 --> 00:30:25,330
I wish he had been the one this time.

366
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,253
But it wasn't.

367
00:30:34,497 --> 00:30:37,840
It was my 8th Brother who personally told me.

368
00:30:42,815 --> 00:30:45,254
He told me explicitly

369
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:50,431
how he rode horses with you,

370
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:55,121
gave you jasmine flowers, and

371
00:30:59,883 --> 00:31:02,691
that the bracelet you wore, when you first entered the Palace,

372
00:31:03,134 --> 00:31:05,060
was a present from him.

373
00:31:11,561 --> 00:31:14,058
You held hands,

374
00:31:14,058 --> 00:31:16,920
looked at stars on the grasslands,

375
00:31:19,316 --> 00:31:21,313
admired the moon together, and that

376
00:31:28,976 --> 00:31:32,820
he hugged you, kissed you.

377
00:31:37,978 --> 00:31:40,360
You promised each other,

378
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:48,680
" Life and death intertwined,
(reciting a chinese poem)

379
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:55,960
holding hands... and growing old together"!

380
00:31:55,960 --> 00:32:01,040
Don't say it! Don't say anymore!

381
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:06,120
Don't say it?

382
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:11,561
When he was telling me all this,

383
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:16,562
I said that over and over again in my heart.

384
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,471
But I could only listen on.

385
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:30,000
I could only listen to it!

386
00:32:34,435 --> 00:32:37,520
Do you know what that feels like?

387
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:46,577
Do you know how hurt I am?

388
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:54,800
So it's true, words can kill a person.

389
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:02,380
What 8th Brother said

390
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,882
was like a knife

391
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:12,623
piercing me over and over again.

392
00:33:40,179 --> 00:33:42,960
I won't allow you to touch me ever again.

393
00:33:44,209 --> 00:33:47,840
I said before that the only thing I was ever afraid of, was that you would leave me.

394
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:55,122
Right now,

395
00:33:56,919 --> 00:33:59,500
I'm not afraid of anything anymore.

396
00:34:55,626 --> 00:34:57,677
As the previous Emperor wished,

397
00:34:58,619 --> 00:35:00,649
I bestow Maertai Rouxi

398
00:35:01,137 --> 00:35:04,503
as Xun Qinjunwang's Ce'fujin!
(14th Prince's minor wife)

399
00:35:05,159 --> 00:35:07,267
Thank you, Your Majesty.

400
00:35:22,278 --> 00:35:27,160
I knew him before I met him.

401
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:32,600
But now meeting is as good as not seeing each other.

402
00:35:33,352 --> 00:35:37,740
Cutting off ties with the Emperor,

403
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:45,640
in order to kill ourselves with longing.

404
00:35:53,283 --> 00:35:54,751
Done packing?

405
00:35:55,387 --> 00:35:57,080
This is enough.

406
00:35:57,080 --> 00:36:00,320
I'll just leave the rest for Cheng Huan.

407
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:08,312
Gugu, are you going to leave all of this for me?

408
00:36:08,312 --> 00:36:11,748
Yes. Keep them if you like them.

409
00:36:11,748 --> 00:36:13,638
If you don't like them, do what you like with them.

410
00:36:13,638 --> 00:36:16,880
I want to keep everything of yours, Aunt.

411
00:36:22,848 --> 00:36:24,160
Let's go.

412
00:37:57,420 --> 00:37:59,930
You must promise to never let anyone touch your hair,

413
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:02,763
only I can do it.

414
00:38:29,709 --> 00:38:32,860
The wind is strong outside, be careful not to catch cold.

415
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:09,579
The time when you forced me to leave 10th's residence,

416
00:39:09,579 --> 00:39:11,369
it was the best thing

417
00:39:11,369 --> 00:39:13,798
that happened in my life.

418
00:39:13,798 --> 00:39:15,813
It was also in mine.

419
00:39:43,802 --> 00:39:44,840
Wang'ye.

420
00:40:37,283 --> 00:40:39,001
Thank you.

421
00:40:41,209 --> 00:40:43,440
I had my own selfish desires.

422
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:47,880
If not for indulging my wish to leave,

423
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:51,320
you wouldn't have done that.

424
00:40:52,069 --> 00:40:54,591
The hot springs at Zun Hua are really good.

425
00:40:54,591 --> 00:40:56,760
It will be good for your legs.

426
00:40:59,206 --> 00:41:04,025
The scenery there is also very picturesque.

427
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:10,260
14th will definitely treat you well.

428
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:14,220
I just hope that you will treat yourself well.

429
00:41:15,521 --> 00:41:20,140
Since you've decided to leave, you should make a clean break.

430
00:41:21,451 --> 00:41:25,845
Treat everything in the past as something dead

431
00:41:25,845 --> 00:41:30,580
and from now on, it's a new beginning.

432
00:41:32,325 --> 00:41:33,886
Do you have any message

433
00:41:34,329 --> 00:41:36,944
I can help you pass on to 14th?

434
00:41:38,455 --> 00:41:40,295
My end is near,

435
00:41:41,681 --> 00:41:43,780
there's nothing left to be said.

436
00:41:44,778 --> 00:41:46,875
You must take care of yourself.

437
00:41:49,143 --> 00:41:52,959
You know what I'm thinking.

438
00:41:52,959 --> 00:41:55,434
Since you know, you will be able to understand.

439
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:59,060
There are no hard feelings.

440
00:42:03,315 --> 00:42:05,094
In this lifetime, we were not fated.

441
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:11,642
Whatever it was meant to be, we'll leave it to the next.

442
00:42:17,021 --> 00:42:18,468
Go now.

443
00:42:29,378 --> 00:42:34,260
We might not be able to meet anymore in this lifetime.

444
00:42:53,543 --> 00:42:56,001
Forget about the Palace,

445
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:02,420
forget about all of us.

446
00:43:12,364 --> 00:43:14,475
To be a bride,

447
00:43:15,355 --> 00:43:17,958
you need to look like one.

448
00:43:19,299 --> 00:43:21,780
How can you keep crying?

449
00:43:24,229 --> 00:43:26,015
Quickly, go.

450
00:43:43,062 --> 00:43:45,566
I've always helped you guard against 9th brother,

451
00:43:46,209 --> 00:43:49,235
But I never would have thought that

452
00:43:49,235 --> 00:43:52,857
8th brother personally

453
00:43:52,857 --> 00:43:58,523
was the one to tell the Emperor everything in great detail.

454
00:43:58,523 --> 00:44:01,867
But yet did not say one word about how you parted.

455
00:44:02,410 --> 00:44:04,746
However, much he hated the Emperor,

456
00:44:05,112 --> 00:44:07,980
he should have spared you a thought.

457
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:11,596
What he did,

458
00:44:12,643 --> 00:44:15,868
was to be just enough to make His Majesty to let go.

459
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:20,060
It was not meant to destroy him.

460
00:44:24,035 --> 00:44:25,644
It seems like

461
00:44:26,737 --> 00:44:30,706
he is still the virtuous 8th Prince who has always valued his relationships.

462
00:45:01,296 --> 00:45:06,154
However, far you send me, we still have to bid farewell.

463
00:45:06,154 --> 00:45:08,554
I've always laughed at others,

464
00:45:08,554 --> 00:45:12,820
but now I truly know how hard it is to bid one goodbye.

465
00:45:17,442 --> 00:45:19,454
Gugu, don't leave me!

466
00:45:19,454 --> 00:45:22,060
I will miss you.

467
00:45:29,292 --> 00:45:31,356
Remember, Cheng Huan.

468
00:45:32,032 --> 00:45:34,700
On the 22nd of December of each year,

469
00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:38,130
pray and remember this Gugu.

470
00:45:38,130 --> 00:45:43,152
Other than Imperial Uncle, I will not let anyone else know about that.

471
00:45:45,121 --> 00:45:46,389
Cheng Huan,

472
00:45:46,389 --> 00:45:50,629
kowtow to your Aunt 3 times.

473
00:46:15,321 --> 00:46:19,840
Let's part here. Take care of yourself.

474
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:21,744
"When the grass is green next year,

475
00:46:22,226 --> 00:46:24,459
old friends will no longer look the same."

476
00:46:24,459 --> 00:46:26,666
"The sea holds our closest friends

477
00:46:27,356 --> 00:46:30,020
and the ends of the earth are our neighbors."

478
00:46:33,572 --> 00:46:35,072
Take care.

479
00:46:49,929 --> 00:46:53,369
Gugu! Gugu!

480
00:46:53,369 --> 00:46:55,273
Gugu!

481
00:46:55,273 --> 00:47:00,103
Gugu don't leave! Gugu!

482
00:47:00,103 --> 00:47:03,300
Gugu don't leave me behind!

483
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:05,258
Gugu don't leave!

484
00:47:05,258 --> 00:47:10,460
Please, Gugu! Gugu!
