00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:19,610
♫  In the blink of an eye, a thought of stubborn persistence  ♫

3
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:23,950
♫  We were destined to seek our doom like moths flying towards the flame  ♫

4
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:30,870
♫  Knowing that it’d be a disaster, why am I still at a loss about what to do  ♫

5
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:38,810
♫  The best is not to see, the best is not to miss you  ♫

6
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:44,130
♫  Only like this can I not be in love with you  ♫

7
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:48,130
♫  Just another brushing of the shoulder, and from then... ♫

8
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:53,440
♫  I’ll keep falling deeper and deeper in love with you  ♫

9
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:57,890
♫  It’s the mistake of time, ♫

10
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:01,560
♫ forcing us to pass each other by  ♫

11
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:05,040
♫  How I miss you, how far you are  ♫

12
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:07,800
♫  Even though I’d known it’d only result in pain, ♫

13
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:11,340
♫ at this moment, I still don’t want to escape  ♫

14
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:15,940
♫  Pity these words are too glaring, they hurt the eyes  ♫

15
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:21,000
♫  Two worlds later ♫

16
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:25,080
♫  Don’t want to escape  ♫

17
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:27,590
♫  It’s the mistake of time,  ♫

18
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:30,290
♫  we can only pass each other by  ♫

19
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:35,410
♫  The magnitude of me missing you is as much as how far you are   ♫

20
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:40,920
♫  Even though I know the ending is a mistake that I cannot oppose  ♫

21
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:46,240
♫  Staying in this moment  ♫

22
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:54,570
♫  We can only accept that the feelings run deep, but fate is shallow  ♫

Scarlet Heart
Episode 15

24
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,440
Greetings to Fourth Prince.

25
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,080
Rise.

26
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,400
You, too, like the lotus flowers here?

27
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,120
Yes.

28
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,000
I like the peacefulness here.

29
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,600
All right.

30
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,440
I'll bring you to a place that's truly peaceful.

31
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,120
Fourth Prince, how did you know

32
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,620
that there was a boat here?

33
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:13,240
I like this place

34
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,400
so I had a boat made and placed it here.

35
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,280
Get in the boat.

36
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:48,620
♫ Waiting for summer, waiting for autumn, ♫

37
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:51,520
♫  waiting for the next season. ♫

38
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:56,860
♫ I have to wait for the moon to become full, before you'll be back at my side again. ♫

39
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:58,520
Right now I want to have a rest.

40
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,360
You can do whatever you want.

41
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:04,290
♫ What to do? I still think of you. ♫

42
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:07,530
♫ I suddenly want to see your face. ♫

43
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:10,400
♫ That familiar feeling. ♫

44
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,370
♫ It's all right even if we don't hold hands. ♫

45
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:16,680
♫ We stroll through wind and frost. ♫

46
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:23,950
♫ Even if we can't see each other, we will still yearn for each other day and night. ♫

47
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:29,680
♫ I just want to let you know ♫

48
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,810
♫ that I really am doing well. ♫

49
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:35,470
♫ Loving you my whole life, ♫

50
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:39,050
♫ I, too, will wait for you till I'm old. ♫

51
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:42,170
♫ I just want to let you know ♫

52
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:45,520
♫ I can't let go, neither can I forget ♫

53
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,160
♫ Your smile and your goodness ♫

54
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:54,290
♫ are warm supports for me ♫

55
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:20,960
♫ Waiting for summer, waiting for autumn, ♫

56
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,480
You're not to keep looking at me in this manner.

57
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:26,280
Let go.

58
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,880
I'll let go if you put it down.

59
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:32,300
Then, you can't look at me like you were doing just now.

60
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:33,320
All right.

61
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:39,040
♫ I suddenly want to see your face. ♫

62
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,990
♫ That familiar feeling. ♫

63
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,440
A gentleman never goes back on his word.

64
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:54,000
♫ Even if we can't see each other, we will still yearn for each other day and night. ♫

65
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,560
Get up a little.

66
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,160
I want to sit up.

67
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,240
♫ I just want to let you know ♫

68
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:04,420
♫ that I really am doing well. ♫

69
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:06,970
♫ Loving you my whole life, ♫

70
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:10,640
♫ I, too, will wait for you till I'm old. ♫

71
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:13,830
♫ I just want to let you know ♫

72
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:17,940
Fourth Prince, do you often come here to rest?

73
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:19,480
Occasionally?

74
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:22,880
I can see Fourth Prince likes this place quite a lot.

75
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,080
Why is it just occasionally?

76
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,120
Indulging in beautiful things

77
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,920
will only cause people to lose their wits.

78
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,240
Let's go.

79
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:44,850
♫ are warm supports for me ♫

80
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,920
He's returned to being an ice-block face again.

81
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,720
Ruoxi.

82
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,480
Eunuch Li.

83
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,840
All right.

84
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,160
I think, you're going to have to prepare more

85
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,640
tea and tea sets this time.

86
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,480
Why is that?

87
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,680
Is His Majesty going on an expedition again?

88
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,720
The list of who's accompanying His Majesty has already been announced.

89
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,260
Looks like the expedition this time

90
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:12,360
will be pretty lively.

91
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,560
Crown Prince... Fourth Prince... Eighth Prince...

92
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,340
Ninth Prince... Thirteenth Prince... Fourteenth Prince...

93
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:23,520
Fourteenth Prince?

94
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:27,540
Eunuch Li,

95
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:29,000
will Princess Minmin be going for this expedition?

96
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,480
That's of course.

97
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:33,480
Then I want to ask you a favor--

98
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,400
All right, all right.

99
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:38,320
This time, don't try to get out of it.

100
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:41,320
Now that your health has greatly improved,

101
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,240
you have no more reasons to be excused.

102
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,000
Eunuch Li.

103
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,200
- Eunuch Li--
- Ruoxi,

104
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,980
I am telling you,

105
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:49,600
you need to hurry up and adjust your mentality.

106
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,960
Serve His Majesty wholeheartedly.

107
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,520
Nothing else matters.

108
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,880
You're not young anymore.

109
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,880
You don't have many years left in the palace.

110
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:01,200
In future, your marriage

111
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,640
hangs on the word of His Majesty.

112
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:23,320
Jie Jie.

113
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,320
Leaving the Forbidden City and coming outside the Great Wall.

114
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,720
It really is different.

115
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,960
Let's not talk about the other things,

116
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,640
just this boundless grassland

117
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,040
and the vast azure blue sky

118
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,080
is enough to make one feel spirited.

119
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,120
You're right.

120
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,720
The grasslands outside the Great Wall

121
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,600
is truly a place where one can be free.

122
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,280
No wonder His Majesty

123
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,779
often makes expeditions outside the Great Wall.

124
00:08:41,779 --> 00:08:44,559
His Majesty doesn't come just to enjoy this scenery.

125
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:46,559
This I know.

126
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:49,840
His Majesty needs to meet the Mongolian king to discuss politics as well.

127
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:52,960
I heard that in a few days, the Mongolians will be coming to see His Majesty.

128
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,360
Yes, they're reaching soon.

129
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:59,240
I cannot be unprepared.

130
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,960
Jie Jie, what else is needed? I'll go prepare it.

131
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:02,960
Nothing much.

132
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,300
It'll be fine as long as we hurry and get things ready.

133
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:05,400
All right.

134
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,960
Greetings to Fourteenth Prince.

135
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:22,120
- Fourteenth Prince, I have something to say to you.
- I have nothing to say to you.

136
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,080
It's regarding the subject last time.

137
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,160
And related to Princess Minmin.

138
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,240
I owe you a favor. What do you want?

139
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,000
Princess Minmin will be coming in a few days.

140
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:33,000
I wanted to find you to discuss

141
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,360
how we should explain things to her.

142
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,240
Just tell her the truth,

143
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,820
and then apologize

144
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:38,680
and say a few nice words to appease her, won't that be enough?

145
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,140
Is it really that simple?

146
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:42,400
I'm afraid Princess Minmin

147
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,760
isn't that easy to appease.

148
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,200
In my opinion, you, Maertai Ruoxi,

149
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,080
are a master of appeasement.

150
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,760
Is it necessary for you to be so worried?

151
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:55,200
Jerk!

152
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:05,360
Today, King Suwan Guwalgiya will come.

153
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,360
You must take good care of him for me.

154
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,360
He mustn't be neglected.

155
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,400
Yes.

156
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:20,040
Ruoxi, what's wrong?

157
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,000
Are you all right?

158
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,760
- I'm fine.
- All right.

159
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:25,920
Imperial Father,

160
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,580
regarding the task you assigned to me...

161
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:28,660
Imperial Father,

162
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:30,240
I feel a little unwell and need the toilet,

163
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,780
I would like to be excused for a while.

164
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:32,720
Go then.

165
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,820
It's good that Fourteenth Prince has excused himself for a while.

166
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:47,860
At least it'll give me the chance

167
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:49,480
to explain to Princess Minmin.

168
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:53,400
Mongolian King Suwan Guwalgiya has arrived!

169
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:03,560
Greetings to Your Majesty.

170
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:04,720
Please rise, Your Highness.

171
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,920
Greetings to Your Highness.

172
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:13,480
Your Majesty, I haven't seen you for many months, you are the picture of health.

173
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:16,400
I heard that Your Majesty has gained another grandchild,

174
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,680
it truly deserves congratulations.

175
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,940
I, too, feel very comforted.

176
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:24,200
Your Highness, doesn't the same goes for you? You have many children and grandchildren.

177
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,560
Furthermore, you teach your children well,

178
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,680
all of them are competent and lead the various tribes

179
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,400
to keep the border peaceful.

180
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,960
How can I compare to Your Majesty?

181
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:36,280
All the princes are wise and valorous,

182
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,880
with outstanding bearing.

183
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:41,320
Your Highness, don't praise them anymore,

184
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:43,760
otherwise they'll get arrogant.

185
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,280
Come, sit.

186
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,600
Please sit.

187
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,280
Please.

188
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,280
Even if she's a goddess,

189
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,740
if she doesn't move my heart,

190
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:00,360
why is there need to persuade anymore?

191
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,760
I've long heard that the the eldest Prince Jiuwen

192
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,180
is a master of horseback riding and archery.

193
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:12,240
If there's an opportunity,

194
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,080
I would like to ask for your guidance.

195
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,320
The Central Plains have this saying,

196
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,840
"Give a hero his due respect."

197
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:21,060
I've also long heard of your good reputation.

198
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:23,280
Let's compare notes and learn from each other.

199
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:26,280
Your Highness is too modest. Please drink some tea.

200
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:40,260
Why hasn't Fourteenth Prince returned?

201
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:42,860
Reporting to Imperial Father,

202
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:45,220
since yesterday, Fourteenth Prince's stomache has already been feeling unwell.

203
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:47,520
I fear that there was something off with his food recently.

204
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,860
Has the imperial physician been summoned yet?

205
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:50,360
Not yet.

206
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,400
Don't think that because you're young,

207
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:55,080
you don't need to pay attention to small illnesses and minor ailments.

208
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,240
I'll keep that in mind.

209
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,480
Quickly summon the imperial physician

210
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,600
and have him see to Fourteenth Prince.

211
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,840
Yes.

212
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,820
Now that I'm older, do I find out the importance

213
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:06,320
of regularly taking care of one's health.

214
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,440
Your Majesty is absolutely right.

215
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:12,600
I, too, pay attention to what I regularly consume.

216
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:18,080
In spring and summer, you cultivate the yang; in fall and winter, you cultivate the yin.

217
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:22,600
Use eating habits to balance one's health. Obeying the cycle of sprouting, growing, harvesting, storing,

218
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,120
we should follow the change in the four seasons.

219
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:27,940
As they say, our bodies should be regulated to follow the rhythm of nature.

220
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:29,320
Let's drink tea.

221
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,160
Please.

222
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,520
Please.

223
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:42,080
Eighth Brother, have you already met the Mongolian King and Princess Minmin?

224
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:43,940
Why?

225
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:45,720
Ruoxi is still worried to death.

226
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,920
Fourteenth Brother,

227
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,560
it's only natural that Ruoxi is worried.

228
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,920
We're the ones who implicated her.

229
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:53,080
Eighth Brother, why are you still so considerate towards her?

230
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:56,780
No matter what,

231
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:58,440
it was to help us that Ruoxi

232
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,480
lied to Minmin.

233
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:03,520
We shouldn't let our feelings cloud our judgement

234
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,760
just because of what happened between the two of us.

235
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:06,840
We need to think of a way

236
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,240
to help Ruoxi solve this problem.

237
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:09,800
I understand.

238
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:12,540
Actually, seeing Ruoxi look so worried,

239
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:14,440
I don't have the heart to do it either.

240
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:17,760
But avoiding Princess Minmin isn't a long-term solution either.

241
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,420
Just as Ruoxi said,

242
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:20,920
apologizing might not necessarily be of any use.

243
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,280
I think Ruoxi

244
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,960
will definitely find Princess Minmin to explain.

245
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,680
Let's work together with her

246
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,320
to apologize to Princess Minmin.

247
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,560
Once her temper cools,

248
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,480
we'll give her an explanation.

249
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,760
I understand.

250
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:34,960
If there's anything,

251
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,380
I will take all responsibility

252
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:37,720
and won't implicate Ruoxi

253
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,180
and cause her to suffer.

254
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,480
It's best not to delay matters.

255
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,660
It's best that the situation gets resolved as soon as possible,

256
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:55,160
otherwise dragging it on might lead to trouble,

257
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,520
and who knows what other complications might arise.

258
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:01,180
But how should I explain it?

259
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,840
Greetings to Princess Minmin.

260
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,800
Ruoxi, get up, get up.

261
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,320
You and I don't need to be so formal.

262
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,640
I haven't seen you for the good half of a year. How are you doing?

263
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,940
Everything's fine. And you?

264
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:23,520
I'm fine as well.

265
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,080
- You...
- You...

266
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:33,360
You speak first.

267
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,600
Did you help me ask?

268
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,720
He doesn't have any feelings for me?

269
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:49,720
Since your father

270
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,800
doesn't wish for you to marry Thirteenth Prince as well,

271
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,040
from now on, you

272
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,560
should stop thinking about him.

273
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:56,920
Why?

274
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,880
Why doesn't he like me?

275
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,120
Don't tell me I can't compare to his Fujin?

276
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,000
Princess, it's really not because you're not good.

277
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,340
I need to go ask him!

278
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:07,520
What about me does he not like?

279
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,360
Princess!

280
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:13,160
Princess!

281
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,640
- Giddy up!
- Princess!

282
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:17,480
Princess!

283
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:26,020
Princess Minmin!

284
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:27,000
Fourteenth Prince.

285
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,800
I just want to know which part of me is not good enough?

286
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,180
This is not a place for talking.

287
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:36,560
Princess, please return.

288
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,600
Imperial Father is still waiting for me and Fourteenth Brother.

289
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,160
What is there that cannot be said?

290
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:48,640
You... why are you here?

291
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,640
Fourteenth Brother you know each other?

292
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:56,320
Fourteenth Brother? You're Fourteenth Prince?

293
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,360
That's right.

294
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,060
You lied to me!

295
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,480
Princess, please listen to me.

296
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,960
Is he or is he not Fourteenth Prince?

297
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,380
Princess, listen to me explain.

298
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,840
Then is he the person you like?

299
00:17:14,399 --> 00:17:16,040
You lied to me!

300
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,680
You've been using me all along!

301
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,320
I regarded you as my trusted sister,

302
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:20,819
I told you all my feelings.

303
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:22,640
But why did you treat me this way?

304
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,440
Princess, didn't you say that

305
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:26,080
once the child of the grasslands recognizes someone as a friend,

306
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:27,240
they won't easily give up?

307
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:29,399
I beg you to forgive me this time.

308
00:17:29,399 --> 00:17:30,919
It was wrong of me to lie to you.

309
00:17:30,919 --> 00:17:32,080
But I did it for a reason,

310
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,000
I beg of you to listen to my explanation.

311
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:37,540
You're close to her?

312
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:38,480
Yes.

313
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,800
Then did you know

314
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,620
she tricked me into hiding Fourteenth Prince?

315
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,060
I didn't know.

316
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:47,680
Is that how you treat friends?

317
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,200
You lied to him and to me.

318
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:50,660
Princess.

319
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:51,880
I need to go tell the Emperor!

320
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:52,840
I want to see

321
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,960
what dirty deeds you guys have done in the past!

322
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,840
Princess, you mustn't!

323
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,520
You can hit me or yell at me.

324
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,800
It's all my fault!

325
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,640
Princess, I understand if you're upset.

326
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,760
Regarding the matter that happened half a year ago,

327
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,680
there's no need to trouble the Princess to report it,

328
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:08,160
I'll personally go to Imperial Father to make matters clear.

329
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,080
Fourteenth Brother!

330
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:12,120
What's such a big deal

331
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,520
that it's worthy of being brought up to Imperial Father?

332
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,920
She used me to hide Fourteenth Prince.

333
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,560
Both of them were acting very suspicious.

334
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,520
Who knows what they were doing.

335
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,080
Ruoxi is not that kind of person.

336
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,520
Princess, I fear that you're mistaken.

337
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,420
At that time,

338
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:25,160
the Crown Prince said someone attempted to assassinate him.

339
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,000
It's because I believed Ruoxi,

340
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,740
I thought the two were in love, therefore I helped them.

341
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:31,120
Now, thinking back,

342
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,660
what if at that time, there really was someone trying to assassinate the Crown Prince?

343
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:35,240
Princess, there's no need for you to worry about this,

344
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,140
neither is there a need for you to be upset over it.

345
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:38,320
My Fourteenth Brother

346
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,920
and Ruoxi have played together since young.

347
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,960
It's only normal for him to come visit her in disguise.

348
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,280
There really isn't a need

349
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,320
to alarm Imperial Father.

350
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,720
You're so protective over her,

351
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,000
without even asking for a reason?

352
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,280
Is that necessary?

353
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,280
What if it were me,

354
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,360
would you do the same?

355
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:51,500
Without even asking for any explanation,

356
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,740
blindly siding with her?

357
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,180
Thirteenth Prince.

358
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:56,840
As to what kind of person Ruoxi is,

359
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,080
I know it within my heart.

360
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,080
Naturally, I don't need to ask so much.

361
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,040
Princess!

362
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,240
- Princess!
- Rouxi!

363
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,720
- Princess!
- Get on the horse.

364
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:14,080
Ruoxi,

365
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,320
no matter what happens later,

366
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,120
remember to push the blame on me.

367
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,740
I'm a prince after all.

368
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:19,900
Even though defying an imperial decree is a severe matter,

369
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:22,480
but no matter what, I won't be in mortal danger. Do you understand?

370
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,460
Princess, please have mercy,

371
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:43,200
I, Thirteenth Prince, will be infinitely grateful.

372
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,500
What is the matter with you all?

373
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,440
- Greetings to Your Majesty.
- Greetings to Imperial Father.

374
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:24,600
Rise.

375
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:27,480
Minmin, aren't you going to hurry and greet the Emperor?

376
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,560
Your Majesty,

377
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:32,200
this girl has always been spoiled by me,

378
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,960
and runs wild on the grassland all day,

379
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,040
She can't compare with the princesses in the Forbidden City,

380
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,520
not knowing proper etiquette.

381
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,040
Greetings to Your Majesty.

382
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,400
Greetings to Imperial Father.

383
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:46,480
- Rise.
- Thank you, Your Majesty.
- Thank you, Imperial Father.

384
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:50,738
Princess,

385
00:20:50,738 --> 00:20:52,640
why does your face hold anger?

386
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,280
Did Thirteenth Prince bully you?

387
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:59,000
It's just that I wanted to have a horse race with Ruoxi,

388
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,320
but Thirteenth Prince didn't agree,

389
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,760
so we argued a but.

390
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,620
Thirteenth Prince,

391
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:07,260
why didn't you agree?

392
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:09,300
You've made Princess Minmin mad.

393
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:11,900
Even though it hasn't been long since Ruoxi learned how to ride,

394
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:13,960
but having a competition shouldn't be a problem.

395
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:14,940
Then, Your Majesty,

396
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,400
are you allowing me to have a horse race with Ruoxi?

397
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,640
Minmin, stop fooling around.

398
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,040
Just let them have a try.

399
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,760
After all, watching it will entertain us,

400
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,780
it can't be considered fooling around.

401
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,900
Go and get ready then.

402
00:21:34,415 --> 00:21:36,400
This time, for Thirteenth Prince's sake,

403
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,840
I'll give you a chance.

404
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,440
If you win, we'll never mention this again.

405
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,960
But if you lose,

406
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,640
then don't blame me.

407
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,560
You count this as giving a chance?

408
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:47,320
If you want to compete, why don't you compete with me?

409
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:48,811
Enough.

410
00:21:48,811 --> 00:21:50,480
Hurry and help your lover

411
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,760
pick out a good horse.

412
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:52,920
This time,

413
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,560
I won't be like last year,

414
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,120
and purposely let you win anymore.

415
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:57,580
Thank you, Princess.

416
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,280
It's fine. Do your best in the competition.

417
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:08,160
Even if you lose, don't be afraid, you'll still have me.

418
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,520
I hope that this plan to use my manly good looks to charm her

419
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:11,960
will be of some use.

420
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,380
Thank you.

421
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:41,320
Princess, do you mean what you say?

422
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,560
If I win,

423
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,240
we'll still be friends.

424
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,480
If you're able to beat me after only learning to ride for a few months,

425
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,080
of course I won't argue.

426
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:58,080
Ruoxi!

427
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:08,720
Hurry and stop it!

428
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,046
Ruoxi!

429
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:12,600
Ruoxi!

430
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,360
Ruoxi!

431
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,720
What happened?

432
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,280
Come.

433
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,400
Ruoxi,

434
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,040
are you all right?

435
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:33,360
You... you guys have multiple faces!

436
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,040
What does she mean multiple faces?

437
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,760
What is she saying?

438
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,560
Ruoxi, are you all right?

439
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:40,840
You're dismissed.

440
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:41,840
Yes.

441
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,280
Can you hear what I'm saying?

442
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:46,304
Can you hear what I'm saying?

443
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:48,680
Thank god!

444
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,380
You really put your life on line for it?

445
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:52,140
Fine,

446
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:53,840
I won't mention this matter anymore.

447
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,640
Actually, when I was selecting the horse just now,

448
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,080
I wasn't thinking of telling the Emperor anymore.

449
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,440
I just wanted to anger you.

450
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,563
Who told you to trick me in the first place?

451
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:03,099
What are you doing?

452
00:25:03,099 --> 00:25:04,950
I already said that I don't blame you!

453
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:06,080
Why are you still doing this?

454
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,976
The reason why you don't blame me is because you're magnanimous,

455
00:25:07,976 --> 00:25:09,873
but this matter is truly my fault.

456
00:25:09,873 --> 00:25:11,605
Naturally, I should kowtow to you.

457
00:25:11,605 --> 00:25:13,091
Honestly!

458
00:25:13,091 --> 00:25:14,431
Hurry and get up.

459
00:25:14,431 --> 00:25:15,724
Thirteenth Prince, Fourteenth Prince,

460
00:25:15,724 --> 00:25:17,520
the Emperor and the King are getting worried.

461
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,043
Please return quickly.

462
00:25:19,043 --> 00:25:20,780
Understood. You may go.

463
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:21,761
Yes.

464
00:25:21,761 --> 00:25:22,644
Let's go.

465
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,800
Ruoxi, did you get hurt?

466
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:32,860
No.

467
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:34,320
Is your desire to win that strong?

468
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,581
This servant knows her mistake.

469
00:25:36,581 --> 00:25:38,800
Your Majesty, it's not her fault.

470
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,520
I was the one who forced her to race with me.

471
00:25:41,336 --> 00:25:43,660
What on earth did you guys wager, Ruoxi,

472
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:44,760
that you had to win so badly?

473
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:45,960
We didn't wager anything.

474
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:48,130
Minmin, you're not to be rude.

475
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,300
Ruoxi has been by my side for so many years,

476
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:53,840
I know her character very well.

477
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,446
If there wasn't a reason why she had to win,

478
00:25:55,446 --> 00:25:57,400
she definitely wouldn't have acted in such a manner.

479
00:25:58,983 --> 00:26:00,887
Imperial Father. Imperial Father!

480
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:03,162
Your Majesty.

481
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,020
Your Highness, please rise.

482
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:06,640
This is all my daughter's fault.

483
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,440
I have some matters

484
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:10,280
I want to discuss with you in private.

485
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,560
All of you are dismissed.

486
00:26:18,836 --> 00:26:19,800
Prince Heshu,

487
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:20,879
if you have some time,

488
00:26:20,879 --> 00:26:22,200
- would you like to come over to my place to drink some tea?
- This way please.

489
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,015
I'm very honored.

490
00:26:23,015 --> 00:26:24,260
Please.

491
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:25,082
Please.

492
00:26:25,082 --> 00:26:26,380
Princess Minmin,

493
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:27,960
what was just now about?

494
00:26:29,238 --> 00:26:30,800
Crown Prince, didn't you see it?

495
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:33,160
It was just a horse racing competition. Ruoxi won and I lost.

496
00:26:37,017 --> 00:26:38,400
All right then.

497
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,640
I still have other matters,

498
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,600
so I'll take my leave first.

499
00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:48,047
Princess is truly a child of the plains,

500
00:26:48,047 --> 00:26:49,254
even the Crown Prince

501
00:26:49,254 --> 00:26:50,760
was rebuffed.

502
00:26:54,734 --> 00:26:56,613
Princess, what do you think

503
00:26:56,613 --> 00:26:58,200
the King will say to the Emperor?

504
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:08,852
I reckon that Father misunderstood that both of us

505
00:27:08,852 --> 00:27:10,880
were fighting over Thirteenth Prince, so he felt that it wouldn't be good to continue on.

506
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:14,824
Your father didn't misunderstand.

507
00:27:14,824 --> 00:27:17,075
Isn't this the truth?

508
00:27:17,075 --> 00:27:17,797
Otherwise...

509
00:27:17,797 --> 00:27:19,320
why did you get so angry earlier?

510
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:21,158
Why can't you concede even just the slightest?

511
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:24,034
You really are!

512
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:27,126
Good princess, if you don't have a guilty conscience,

513
00:27:27,126 --> 00:27:28,480
why would you be afraid of others talking?

514
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,562
You're only exposing your tracks more and more obviously.

515
00:27:30,562 --> 00:27:31,320
You...

516
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:32,118
hiding behind someone's back,

517
00:27:32,118 --> 00:27:33,742
what kind of brave hero does that?

518
00:27:34,068 --> 00:27:35,740
I'm just a mere girl,

519
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:37,998
I've never thought of being some brave hero.

520
00:27:37,998 --> 00:27:41,242
Although, I am hiding behind the back of a brave hero.

521
00:27:41,242 --> 00:27:43,449
Hey, I'm refuse to uphold this false reputation.

522
00:27:43,449 --> 00:27:44,866
Princess, do whatever you have to,

523
00:27:44,866 --> 00:27:45,720
please don't stand on ceremony.

524
00:27:46,538 --> 00:27:47,640
Princess,

525
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,478
she just had a big scare on the horse.

526
00:27:49,478 --> 00:27:51,024
Why don't you let her off this once?

527
00:27:52,412 --> 00:27:53,713
Look at those two!

528
00:27:53,713 --> 00:27:56,745
Don't know if they were deceiving me then, or deceiving me now.

529
00:27:56,745 --> 00:27:58,742
If you had ever seen those two fighting,

530
00:27:58,742 --> 00:27:59,850
this wouldn't seem strange at all.

531
00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:01,025
Really?

532
00:28:01,025 --> 00:28:01,840
Really.

533
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,976
Those two argue at the drop of a hat.

534
00:28:03,976 --> 00:28:05,740
One argues till his face is red and his throat is sore.

535
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:07,296
The other argues until big fat tears spill from her eyes.

536
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:08,504
- Thirteenth Prince!
- Thirteenth Brother!

537
00:28:08,504 --> 00:28:09,015
Fine. Fine.

538
00:28:09,015 --> 00:28:10,408
I won't say any more. All right?

539
00:28:10,408 --> 00:28:12,265
I don't dare to provoke Fourteenth Brother,

540
00:28:12,265 --> 00:28:13,194
for

541
00:28:13,194 --> 00:28:14,727
provoking Fourteenth Brother

542
00:28:14,727 --> 00:28:16,306
is equivalent to provoking Eighth and Ninth Brother.

543
00:28:16,306 --> 00:28:17,931
When all three of you come at me together,

544
00:28:17,931 --> 00:28:19,292
I don't stand a chance.

545
00:28:27,614 --> 00:28:28,589
Ruoxi,

546
00:28:28,589 --> 00:28:29,796
this time I really need to thank you.

547
00:28:30,423 --> 00:28:32,217
The person you need to thank is Thirteenth Prince,

548
00:28:32,217 --> 00:28:33,649
there's no need to thank me.

549
00:28:34,092 --> 00:28:35,114
I was just saving myself.

550
00:28:35,114 --> 00:28:37,343
I wouldn't have thought that Thirteenth Brother's plan to use his manly good looks to charm her

551
00:28:37,343 --> 00:28:38,411
would really work so well.

552
00:28:38,411 --> 00:28:40,733
Even less that he would step out to help me.

553
00:28:42,022 --> 00:28:43,162
Since you put it like that,

554
00:28:43,162 --> 00:28:44,402
you're going to thank him personally?

555
00:28:46,966 --> 00:28:50,671
You are a prince. To swallow your pride and thank Thirteenth Prince

556
00:28:50,671 --> 00:28:51,693
is really not easy.

557
00:28:51,693 --> 00:28:53,958
It's not like I said that I wouldn't go to thank him.

558
00:28:53,958 --> 00:28:56,337
Not only do you have to thank him, you have to give an explanation too.

559
00:28:56,337 --> 00:28:57,358
How should I explain it?

560
00:28:57,358 --> 00:28:58,566
Tell the truth.

561
00:28:58,566 --> 00:29:00,041
The truth?

562
00:29:00,041 --> 00:29:01,863
Thirteenth Prince was willing to help without any questions asked.

563
00:29:01,863 --> 00:29:03,896
Of course I need to treat him with the same trust.

564
00:29:03,896 --> 00:29:06,089
I think that Thirteenth Prince has already sent Princess Minmin off,

565
00:29:06,089 --> 00:29:07,360
and should be back by now.

566
00:29:22,088 --> 00:29:23,509
Say it, you two,

567
00:29:23,509 --> 00:29:25,617
why did you come to find me?

568
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:30,863
Ruoxi,

569
00:29:30,863 --> 00:29:32,621
it's because I knew that you would come look for me,

570
00:29:32,621 --> 00:29:34,046
that's why I specially bade farewell to Fourth Brother

571
00:29:34,046 --> 00:29:35,393
to sit here to wait.

572
00:29:38,249 --> 00:29:41,407
That day, after hearing that His Majesty was transferring a good number of officials,

573
00:29:42,382 --> 00:29:43,961
Fourteenth Prince defied the imperial decree

574
00:29:43,961 --> 00:29:45,029
to come and find Eighth Prince.

575
00:29:45,819 --> 00:29:47,551
I was the one who arranged for them to meet.

576
00:29:47,551 --> 00:29:48,512
For some unknown reason,

577
00:29:48,512 --> 00:29:50,266
they were discovered by the Crown Prince.

578
00:29:50,266 --> 00:29:51,638
Under the pretext of catching a thief,

579
00:29:51,638 --> 00:29:53,156
they wanted to capture Fourteenth Prince.

580
00:29:53,899 --> 00:29:55,074
Left with no better choice,

581
00:29:55,074 --> 00:29:56,907
I lied to Princess Minmin,

582
00:29:56,907 --> 00:29:58,936
and said that Fourteenth Prince was my lover.

583
00:29:58,936 --> 00:30:00,183
I asked for her to help me

584
00:30:00,183 --> 00:30:01,762
hide Fourteenth Prince,

585
00:30:01,762 --> 00:30:03,208
and evade capture by the Crown Prince.

586
00:30:03,512 --> 00:30:06,684
I say, no wonder Fourteenth Brother reported illness to stay at home during that period,

587
00:30:06,684 --> 00:30:08,974
he actually came to outside the Great Wall.

588
00:30:08,974 --> 00:30:10,942
Thirteenth Brother, regardless,

589
00:30:10,942 --> 00:30:12,450
I really have to thank you this time.

590
00:30:12,450 --> 00:30:13,604
Thank me?

591
00:30:15,015 --> 00:30:17,830
Rare. Truly rare.

592
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:18,905
Ruoxi,

593
00:30:18,905 --> 00:30:21,127
your abilities are not to be slighted.

594
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:27,341
Thirteenth Prince,

595
00:30:27,341 --> 00:30:28,706
will you report this to Fourth Prince?

596
00:30:28,706 --> 00:30:30,796
You don't want Fourth Brother to know about this?

597
00:30:36,508 --> 00:30:37,636
Regarding this matter,

598
00:30:37,636 --> 00:30:39,501
I don't want to hide it from Fourth Brother.

599
00:30:39,501 --> 00:30:41,941
Even if Fourth Brother were to know about what Fourteenth Brother did,

600
00:30:41,941 --> 00:30:43,070
so what?

601
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:44,317
Are you two still worried that

602
00:30:44,317 --> 00:30:46,121
he would tell Imperial Father about this?

603
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:49,437
Furthermore,

604
00:30:49,437 --> 00:30:51,034
half of the reason that

605
00:30:51,034 --> 00:30:52,042
I helped you this time

606
00:30:52,042 --> 00:30:54,199
is because of my friendship with Ruoxi.

607
00:30:54,199 --> 00:30:57,197
The other half is also because of Fourth Brother and Concubine De.

608
00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:00,176
Fourteenth Brother, our Fourth Brother

609
00:31:00,176 --> 00:31:01,390
may appear aloof,

610
00:31:01,390 --> 00:31:03,627
and is too hard-handed in the way he handles some matters.

611
00:31:03,627 --> 00:31:04,634
But you can rest assured

612
00:31:05,161 --> 00:31:08,047
that no matter what, he wouldn't go to the extent

613
00:31:08,047 --> 00:31:10,012
of doing anything against his own little brother.

614
00:31:12,627 --> 00:31:13,681
All right.

615
00:31:13,681 --> 00:31:15,796
That's all for this matter.

616
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:23,269
I want to drink tea.

617
00:31:23,305 --> 00:31:24,387
This.

618
00:31:26,756 --> 00:31:27,870
Thirteenth Brother,

619
00:31:27,870 --> 00:31:30,624
does she always behave like this when she's with you?

620
00:31:31,746 --> 00:31:33,843
This lass has always been like that.

621
00:31:33,843 --> 00:31:35,097
Usually,

622
00:31:35,097 --> 00:31:37,205
she does even more insolent things than this.

623
00:31:38,626 --> 00:31:40,073
Thirteenth Prince,

624
00:31:40,073 --> 00:31:41,624
King Suwan-Guwalgiya

625
00:31:41,624 --> 00:31:43,728
knows about Princess Minmin's feelings.

626
00:31:43,728 --> 00:31:45,610
Be careful that he might get you to be his son-in-law.

627
00:31:46,771 --> 00:31:47,793
Let him be.

628
00:31:48,443 --> 00:31:51,276
If he doesn't mind Princess Minmin marrying me as a minor wife,

629
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,134
then I can only marry her.

630
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:55,509
But she sincerely likes you!

631
00:31:55,509 --> 00:31:56,763
If you don't like her,

632
00:31:56,763 --> 00:31:57,845
then don't marry her.

633
00:31:57,845 --> 00:31:58,846
She is not a piece of furniture which

634
00:31:58,846 --> 00:32:00,332
you can just marry and display at home.

635
00:32:00,332 --> 00:32:01,732
I don't want to hold her up either,

636
00:32:01,732 --> 00:32:03,597
but if Imperial Father issues an edict,

637
00:32:03,597 --> 00:32:05,043
do you want me to defy his order?

638
00:32:07,809 --> 00:32:08,944
I don't care.

639
00:32:08,944 --> 00:32:10,323
Whatever it is, if you don't like Minmin,

640
00:32:10,323 --> 00:32:11,699
you can't marry her.

641
00:32:15,262 --> 00:32:16,237
I...

642
00:32:23,343 --> 00:32:25,479
Ruoxi! Ruoxi!

643
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,851
Fourteenth Prince, please return.

644
00:32:29,851 --> 00:32:31,637
I'm going to visit Princess Minmin.

645
00:32:31,637 --> 00:32:33,745
Are you going to advise Minmin not to marry Thirteenth Brother?

646
00:32:36,137 --> 00:32:38,598
Actually, I don't want her to marry Thirteenth Brother either.

647
00:32:41,808 --> 00:32:44,244
Minmin is the precious daughter of the King.

648
00:32:44,244 --> 00:32:45,680
If she marries Thirteenth Brother,

649
00:32:46,423 --> 00:32:47,817
I fear that it won't be beneficial to Eighth Brother.

650
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,953
Fourteenth Prince, you'd better return.

651
00:32:52,953 --> 00:32:55,161
You don't have to tell me matters like this.

652
00:32:55,161 --> 00:32:56,422
Rouxi.

653
00:32:57,012 --> 00:32:59,248
Earlier, when I saw how you interacted with Thirteenth Brother,

654
00:32:59,248 --> 00:33:01,956
I felt that I've belittled you these few years.

655
00:33:01,956 --> 00:33:03,945
Now, I'm willing to sincerely befriend you,

656
00:33:03,945 --> 00:33:05,896
but look at your attitude towards me.

657
00:33:05,896 --> 00:33:07,800
How am I inferior to Thirteenth Brother?

658
00:33:08,598 --> 00:33:09,974
Don't you forget that

659
00:33:09,974 --> 00:33:12,274
you originated from Eighth Brother's residence.

660
00:33:13,735 --> 00:33:16,125
Thirteenth Prince will never give me any pressure.

661
00:33:16,125 --> 00:33:17,297
Our friendship does not

662
00:33:17,297 --> 00:33:19,422
involve any material gain.

663
00:33:19,422 --> 00:33:20,944
Thirteenth Prince would also never have said

664
00:33:20,944 --> 00:33:22,852
what you said just now.

665
00:33:22,852 --> 00:33:24,416
That's the difference.

666
00:33:28,812 --> 00:33:31,656
- Get out.
- Minmin, do listen to our father.

667
00:33:31,656 --> 00:33:32,817
Princess, don't throw things anymore.

668
00:33:32,817 --> 00:33:34,489
I don't want to listen, all of you go away.

669
00:33:35,771 --> 00:33:37,782
Princess, you...

670
00:33:37,782 --> 00:33:38,924
Greetings to Prince Heshu.

671
00:33:38,924 --> 00:33:40,410
Miss Rouxi, don't stand on ceremony.

672
00:33:40,410 --> 00:33:43,010
- Princess, don't.
- What's wrong with Princess Minmin?

673
00:33:43,010 --> 00:33:46,134
This is such a headache.

674
00:33:46,134 --> 00:33:47,313
It's great that you are here.

675
00:33:47,313 --> 00:33:48,674
Miss Rouxi,

676
00:33:48,674 --> 00:33:49,953
help me to persuade her.

677
00:33:52,066 --> 00:33:54,270
Princess, don't be angry.

678
00:33:54,270 --> 00:33:56,000
- Princess.
- I don't want to hear it.

679
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,035
Go away.

680
00:33:57,862 --> 00:33:59,625
Princess, don't be angry.

681
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:02,629
I don't want to hear. Get lost.

682
00:34:03,212 --> 00:34:04,951
Miss Rouxi.

683
00:34:07,345 --> 00:34:08,467
You go out first.

684
00:34:08,467 --> 00:34:09,388
Yes.

685
00:34:09,388 --> 00:34:10,967
Bring a basin of water later.

686
00:34:10,967 --> 00:34:11,989
Yes.

687
00:34:21,624 --> 00:34:23,390
Rouxi.

688
00:34:24,279 --> 00:34:26,090
My father begged the Emperor

689
00:34:26,090 --> 00:34:28,497
to grant me a marriage.

690
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:30,077
Who is it?

691
00:34:30,959 --> 00:34:34,000
It's a Prince from Irgen-Gioro tribe.

692
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,959
They will be here to see the Emperor soon.

693
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:41,039
They are one of the eight big tribes of the grassland, right?

694
00:34:43,519 --> 00:34:45,160
Anyway, I'm not marrying him.

695
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:48,640
Even if I'm to hang myself with a rope, I'm not marrying him!

696
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:54,800
Princess Minmin,

697
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,800
are you really prepared to marry Thirteenth Prince

698
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,420
and become a minor wife of his?

699
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:01,620
Staying in a small courtyard,

700
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:03,820
spending the whole day hoping that after he returns from court,

701
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:06,400
he will remember you and go over to visit you?

702
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:09,540
To put it cruelly,

703
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:13,280
you aren't Thirteenth Prince's love.

704
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,980
With your character,

705
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:17,680
if you get into an argument with his other wives,

706
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:20,040
have you considered if he will help you?

707
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:25,320
I know it might be a little cruel for me to say this.

708
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:29,720
But Princess, think about it seriously,

709
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:31,680
among the wives your father has,

710
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:35,460
besides a few who are favored by your father,

711
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:37,280
how have the rest spent their lives?

712
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,560
Have you ever thought that

713
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:42,800
one day,

714
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:45,380
you will become like them?

715
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:47,460
Right now, your father's doing this

716
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:49,920
not to actually make you marry some prince.

717
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:54,200
He only wants you to give up on Thirteenth Prince.

718
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:57,760
Do you know

719
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:00,000
why your father stopped us today?

720
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:07,680
In my opinion, it's not because he's afraid of losing face because we got into a jealous fight over Thirteenth Prince.

721
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,640
If it's not because of losing face,

722
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,320
then what was it for?

723
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:15,720
The Emperor has been trying to win over the various tribes of the grassland all this while.

724
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,640
If his son can marry you,

725
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:21,080
he will be delighted for it to happen.

726
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:24,280
If what happened today were made known,

727
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:28,880
I fear that the Emperor will finalize your marriage with Thirteenth Prince.

728
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:31,840
King Suwan-Guwalgiya,

729
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:33,280
no matter how unwilling he is,

730
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:35,200
he won't be able to object.

731
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:39,520
It's because you father wanted to protect you,

732
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,120
that's why he was in such a rush to speak out

733
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:43,080
and take responsibility for everything.

734
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,560
Princess,

735
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:53,000
you have a father and brother who sincerely love you.

736
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,840
If you stay on the grasslands,

737
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:58,440
no one will dare to bully you.

738
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:02,000
Your beauty has also attracted

739
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,680
the attention of the Crown Prince,

740
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:07,000
but your father is just pretending to be oblivious.

741
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:10,520
It it'd been other fathers,

742
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:11,920
they would have made use of marriage

743
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,720
to exchange for more power.

744
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:19,800
Princess, as someone born into privilege,

745
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,460
with regards to such stories,

746
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:23,520
you should have also seen and heard of them before.

747
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,280
Tears don't suit you.

748
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:37,760
Don't tell me your strong will

749
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,720
is used to go against your father?

750
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:45,000
If you don't want to marry

751
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,440
that whatever prince,

752
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,360
you could pretend

753
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:50,520
to be suicidal

754
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:52,400
to threaten your father.

755
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:56,040
As long as you give up on Thirteenth Prince,

756
00:37:56,920 --> 00:38:00,480
I think that it will still be of use.

757
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,200
So, I...

758
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:04,680
cannot see Thirteenth Prince in future again?

759
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:07,100
Yes.

760
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:08,400
Then, can I still

761
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:11,140
meet someone like Thirteenth Prince in the future?

762
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:13,760
If you give up on this moon, Thirteenth Prince,

763
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,720
you'll definitely be able to find a star that belongs to you.

764
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:23,560
He will be better than him, and love you more.

765
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:26,760
But I still feel like crying.

766
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:28,240
Cry then.

767
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:30,880
Remember that after you're done crying,

768
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,900
dry your eyes, and

769
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:34,280
raise your head.

770
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:36,920
Don't miss

771
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,640
the star that belongs to you.

772
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:09,520
Rouxi.

773
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:12,440
Princess Minmin.

774
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:14,200
Why are you standing on ceremony with me?

775
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:15,320
My father promised me that

776
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:17,260
he will beg the Emperor not to appoint my marriage anymore.

777
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:18,960
He says that he wanted me to

778
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,320
find someone I like on the grasslands on my own accord.

779
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:24,800
But my father also says that the Irgen-Gioro Zuoying

780
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,080
suits his fancy a lot.

781
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:28,760
That's good. I'm happy for you.

782
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:31,600
My father always praises you, and

783
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,800
he said that no wonder His Majesty places you in such high regard.

784
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:35,560
How did that come about?

785
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,120
Because I told him

786
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,560
that I've figured it all out

787
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,320
and don't want to marry Thirteenth Prince anymore.

788
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:48,640
My father thought that I was just coaxing him and was lying to him.

789
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:51,360
So I told him all of what you said to me.

790
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:54,240
Since Thirteenth Prince doesn't like me,

791
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:56,560
it's pretty meaningless to marry him too.

792
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,200
My father then said that

793
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:59,560
having a friend such as you

794
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:00,920
is truly my good fortune.

795
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:04,320
From now on, can I address you as my elder sister?

796
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:08,160
Yes, but only in private.

797
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,240
You mustn't do it in front of others.

798
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:23,140
What's wrong?

799
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:28,680
I think, even if I do find the star that belongs to me,

800
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:33,120
I will never forget Thirteenth Prince's smile and singing.

801
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:36,560
I want to dance for him,

802
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:40,600
that way, whenever he sees others dance,

803
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:42,280
he will recall

804
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:45,000
that Minmin once danced for him.

805
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,480
All right.

806
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:51,280
I will definitely do my best to help you

807
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,400
and make it such that Thirteenth Prince

808
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,280
will never forget what he sees,

809
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,540
and will forever remember you.

810
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:00,980
Fold these cloth.

811
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:02,000
Jiejie, Jiejie,

812
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,240
look at this dress?

813
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:04,660
What do you think about the design?

814
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:05,960
The button is not suitable.

815
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:06,960
Change to another.

816
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:07,840
All right.

817
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,120
Jiejie, the muslin's here.

818
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,280
Do you still need more satin?

819
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:11,800
We still need more.

820
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:13,780
Miss Ruoxi,

821
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:15,160
this is the construction plan. Please have a look.

822
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:17,760
Add another frame here.

823
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:19,000
I want to make some accessories.

824
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:22,000
As for the rest, I will tell the craftsmen later.

825
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,680
- Go and do these first.
- Yes.

826
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:24,620
Jiejie,

827
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:26,500
you have really worked hard this time.

828
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:27,620
Not at all.

829
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:29,840
I hope that come then, we'll be able to give everyone a surprise.

830
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:30,880
Jiejie, Princess,

831
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,560
we're really looking forward to this performance.

832
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:35,260
That's right. I think this will definitely be a great show.

833
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:36,640
We really want to watch it.

834
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:38,200
Actually, I'm really looking forward to it too.

835
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:39,240
All right then.

836
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:41,320
Let's all "add oil"* then!
(*work hard, in modern terms)

837
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,040
Add oil?

838
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:44,200
Add oil?

839
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:46,880
It means to work harder.

840
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:51,240
Get back to work.

841
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:55,920
Good.

842
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:00,560
Good.

843
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:03,760
Good.

844
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:04,720
Good.

845
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:07,240
Good.

846
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:10,320
That's good.

847
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:13,200
Ruoxi,

848
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:15,080
you've been bustling about all day,

849
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:17,560
ordering these craftsmen to build such a big structure.

850
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:20,460
One day, you need silk, the other, you need satin.

851
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:22,500
You've set up such a big stage,

852
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:24,680
when the time comes, if nothing comes of it,

853
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:27,520
I don't know where you can show your face.

854
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:29,480
Also, don't implicate me

855
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:31,920
and make me lose face during the King's farewell banquet.

856
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:33,320
People will laugh at me.

857
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:35,140
No, no.

858
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:36,160
Then, when the time comes,

859
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:37,400
I'll need Your Majesty to help me then.

860
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:38,920
As long as Your Majesty gives praise,

861
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:40,440
who would still dare to laugh at me?

862
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:42,360
If it's not good, the first person to be punished is you.

863
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:48,920
If it's not good, the first person to be scolded will definitely be Minmin.

864
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:50,640
It's all because of her, she keeps fooling around.

865
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:57,200
Look quickly! Look quickly!

866
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:59,400
What a big eagle!

867
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:09,160
Eagle striking the sky!

868
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:13,420
You should all have such magnificent aspirations,

869
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:15,820
in the wide domain,

870
00:43:15,820 --> 00:43:17,900
to truly showcase your talent!

871
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:20,040
- Yes.
- Yes.
- Yes.

872
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:22,700
Imperial Father,

873
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:24,920
this eagle is Crown Prince's new pet.

874
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,740
Crown Prince, you know how to train eagles?

875
00:43:40,740 --> 00:43:44,600
Yes, like Imperial Father,

876
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:45,960
I admire hunting eagles the most

877
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:47,240
for their bravery and calmness.

878
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:49,940
Especially when they are on the hunt,

879
00:43:49,940 --> 00:43:52,840
the speed, accuracy, and fierce alpha aggressive aura they have.

880
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:54,360
I firmly believe, in this world,

881
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:55,640
all royals,

882
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:57,760
with the exception of Imperial Father of course,

883
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,160
I have the ability

884
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:00,160
to train them.

885
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,880
Good. Well spoken.

886
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:04,480
Well spoken.

887
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:09,340
Crown Prince, today I would like to see

888
00:44:09,340 --> 00:44:12,080
how you subdue the king of the sky!

889
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:13,040
Yes.

890
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:19,560
Release them.

891
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:56,480
- Your Imperial Majesty!
- Imperial Father!

892
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:01,640
Imperial Father!

893
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:02,960
Your Majesty, are you all right?

894
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:04,000
Imperial Father!

895
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,720
- Are you all right?
I'm all right.

896
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:20,000
Your Majesty, it's Zuoying.

897
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:30,660
He is Prince Zuoying?

898
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:34,840
Imperial Father, I gave you a fright.

899
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:36,360
Please punish me.

900
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:38,540
You aren't entirely to be blamed for this.

901
00:45:38,540 --> 00:45:41,020
Animals, by nature, are wild and hard to tame.

902
00:45:41,020 --> 00:45:43,260
But you need to remember this lesson well.

903
00:45:43,260 --> 00:45:45,040
- Rise.
- Yes.

904
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:47,080
I will remember.

905
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:52,320
Your subject, Irgen-Gioro Zuoying

906
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:54,960
was late in saving Your Majesty and caused you to suffer a fright,

907
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,640
I hope Your Majesty will forgive me.

908
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:57,660
Rise.

909
00:45:57,660 --> 00:45:58,760
Thank you, Your Majesty.

910
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:02,720
Zuoying, your eagle training skills

911
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:04,120
are getting better and better.

912
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:06,720
This time, you've earned merit for saving me.

913
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:09,120
What reward would you like?

914
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:10,680
This is just part of what I should do,

915
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:11,680
I wouldn't dare to ask for a reward.

916
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:14,160
Besides, there was a big snow storm last winter

917
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:15,840
that killed many cows and sheep.

918
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:17,200
This time, I

919
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:19,440
came as a person awaiting punishment.

920
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:20,820
That was a natural disaster,

921
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:22,600
the responsibility shouldn't be borne by you alone.

922
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:26,320
This year, has anything been done to prevent disaster?

923
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:28,680
Yes, your Imperial Majesty. I have already gathered food

924
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:30,280
and found an empty place in advance,

925
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:31,800
in case of any sudden changes of weather.

926
00:46:32,580 --> 00:46:34,120
Good.

927
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:37,820
King Suwan-Guwalgiya has really good taste.

928
00:46:37,820 --> 00:46:39,120
When comparing this Prince Zuoying

929
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:41,780
to Thirteenth and Fourteenth Prince,

930
00:46:41,780 --> 00:46:43,660
he isn't the least inferior.

931
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:45,580
The only thing

932
00:46:45,580 --> 00:46:48,240
is whether or not he and Minmin are fated to be.

933
00:46:52,930 --> 00:46:57,710
♫ Stopping here, afraid to go any further,  ♫

934
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:03,930
♫ so sorrow will be unable to make an appearance.  ♫

935
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:10,600
♫  On the next page, the farewell penned by you,  ♫

936
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:16,330
♫  it was not up to me to refuse.  ♫

937
00:47:18,010 --> 00:47:23,530
♫  We’ve walked down this path too hastily.  ♫

938
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:30,350
♫  Embracing desires that weren’t realistic.  ♫

939
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:36,630
♫  Not in time, wasn’t able to wait long enough to look back and admire.  ♫

940
00:47:37,260 --> 00:47:42,160
♫  The fragrance of magnolia is unable to hide wounds.  ♫

941
00:47:42,970 --> 00:47:48,890
♫  No longer looking for the sun’s rays peeking through the clouds.  ♫

942
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:55,170
♫  No longer looking for the paradise that we promised each other. ♫

943
00:47:55,750 --> 00:48:01,780
♫  No longer sighing, you once said that life is unpredictable.  ♫

944
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:08,670
♫  The three inches of sunlight that I was unable to borrow.  ♫

945
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:18,080
♫  No longer looking for the sunlight peeking through the clouds.  ♫

946
00:48:18,510 --> 00:48:24,460
♫  No longer looking for the paradise that we promised each other  ♫

947
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:30,880
♫  No longer sighing, you once said that life is unpredictable.  ♫

948
00:48:31,590 --> 00:48:37,310
♫  The three inches of sunlight that I was unable to borrow  ♫

949
00:48:38,140 --> 00:48:46,010
♫  That paradise is the place where I’d loved you  ♫
