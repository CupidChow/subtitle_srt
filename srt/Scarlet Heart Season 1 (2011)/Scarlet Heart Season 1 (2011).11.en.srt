3
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:23,830
♫  We were destined to seek our doom like moths flying towards the flame  ♫

00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:30,410
♫  Knowing that it’d be a disaster, why am I still at a loss about what to do  ♫

5
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:38,860
♫  The best is not to see, the best is not to miss you  ♫

6
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:43,850
♫  Only like this can I not be in love with you  ♫

7
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:48,130
♫  Just another brushing of the shoulder, and from then...♫

8

♫  I’ll keep falling deeper and deeper in love with you  ♫

9

Scarlet Heart
Episode 11

24
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:03,100
Don't be scared.

25
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:04,240
Who doesn't fall when riding?

26
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,540
I often fell when I was younger too.

27
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:06,880
Sit tight!

28
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,439
Ruoxi!

29
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:17,800
Hang on, Ruoxi!

30
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:23,700
Ruoxi! Ruoxi!

31
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,100
Give your hand to me!

32
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,280
Are you all right?

33
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,400
Ruoxi, are you all right?

34
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,240
Why did you let go of the reins?

35
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,920
Luckily, Bei'le was around.

36
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,660
Otherwise, I'd be in trouble.

37
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:47,780
Come, let me send you back.

38
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:48,900
Give your hand to me.

39
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:50,960
Princess, no need to trouble yourself.

40
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,400
Anyway, since I'll be returning to the camp,

41
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,840
let me be the one to send Ruoxi back.

42
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,360
Bei'le, thank you for the trouble then.

43
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,160
I will visit you when I am free.

44
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,920
You must hurt a lot, right?

45
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:34,820
Just let me indulge this once.

46
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:36,720
Just this once.

47
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,660
Forget that he is Eighth Prince.

48
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:41,300
Forget that he has wives.

49
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:43,740
Forget my rationality.

50
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,680
In your heart,

51
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,200
you have me.

52
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:00,080
You really do have me in your heart.

53
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:30,920
Ruoxi.

54
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,560
Oh yes,

55
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:40,240
why were you together with Princess Minmin?

56
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,200
We met by coincidence.

57
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,600
She found out that I wanted to learn horse riding

58
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,960
and kindly offered to teach me.

59
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,200
But I must really thank you.

60
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,600
Fortunately, we encountered you.

61
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,480
I happen to be passing by

62
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,760
when I saw you riding in the distance and decided to come and take a look.

63
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,920
The next time you learn horse-riding,

64
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,640
let me teach you.

65
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,800
Yes.

66
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,600
I'll take my leave first.

67
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,440
That's right, I have him in my heart.

68
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:37,200
How could I remain

69
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,040
indifferent to all he has done all these years?

70
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,740
But how should I face these feelings?

71
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:45,520
I have too many fears,

72
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,920
too many considerations.

73
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,360
And he has too many ambitions,

74
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,480
too many women.

75
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,160
What should I do?

76
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,200
What should I do in the future?

77
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,520
Ruoxi, it's me

78
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,560
It's me!

79
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,120
Fourteenth Prince?

80
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,640
What are you doing here?

81
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:27,880
Are you crazy?

82
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,360
You actually dare to go against the Imperial decree?

83
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,700
His Majesty ordered you to stay in the capital,

84
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:31,740
but you had the audacity to follow us here.

85
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:32,800
Are you not scared of angering His Majesty?

86
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:36,580
Why aren't you staying in the capital?

87
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:38,760
I came to see Eighth Brother.

88
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,840
But over here,

89
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,180
it's either Imperial Father's men

90
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:44,640
or the Crown Prince's men.

91
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,440
All of them are too familiar with me.

92
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:49,300
I fear that letting them even see me from behind would make them suspicious,

93
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:51,200
so I came over to find you.

94
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,380
Could it be...

95
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:53,700
Has something happened in the capital?

96
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,880
Nothing major.

97
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,240
It's just that I have something

98
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,000
to discuss with Eighth Brother in person.

99
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,920
If I write a letter,

100
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:04,020
it may be intercepted and read by someone.

101
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:05,280
What's more,

102
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,760
exchanging letters back and forth,

103
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,080
you can't explain yourself well either. It's a waste of effort.

104
00:07:09,532 --> 00:07:11,120
I might as well make a trip myself.

105
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,520
It's that simple?

106
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,660
Even if I explain the details to you, you won't understand,

107
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:15,720
so do ask anymore.

108
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,200
I'm doing this for your own good too.

109
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,480
Hey, what are you up to?

110
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,600
Because you aren't allowing me to tug, I insist on tugging.

111
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,580
You want to tug?

112
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:31,100
I refuse to let you tug.

113
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:42,200
All right, tug if you want.

114
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,680
Done!

115
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,640
Let me think of a way to help you avoid everyone else's attention

116
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,120
so that you can meet with Eighth Prince

117
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:04,800
I just knew it!

118
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,160
You'd definitely have a way.

119
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:15,560
What are you laughing at?

120
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,920
I came up with a good idea

121
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,840
which will definitely not arouse suspicions.

122
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:22,840
Just by looking at you,

123
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:25,040
I can tell that it definitely isn't anything good.

124
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,280
Let me hear you out.

125
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,320
Why don't...

126
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:33,960
you... disguise yourself... as a lady?

127
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,200
A lady?

128
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,640
This way, even if someone sees you together with Eighth Prince,

129
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,600
they won't be suspicious.

130
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:41,159
Moreover, who will even imagine that

131
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:44,160
the great Fourteenth Prince of the Qing Dynasty

132
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,799
would ever disguise himself as a lady?

133
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,880
You actually dare to say such disrespectful things to me?

134
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,680
Today, I must definitely discipline you.

135
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,440
I'm in the wrong, I'm in the wrong

136
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,280
Fourteenth Prince,

137
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,960
my hand hurts on contact.

138
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,400
How did your hand get injured?

139
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,100
When I was horse riding, I accidentally held the reins too tight.

140
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,480
Eighth Brother's heart must be aching again.

141
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,140
Then, please let me off then.

142
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:20,840
Originally, I'd thought that

143
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,180
after living in the palace for so many years,

144
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,780
you'd have definitely become dull.

145
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:25,600
Who'd have thought that you're still like that.

146
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,500
You, even if you had ten heads that could be executed, they wouldn't be enough.

147
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,140
Same goes for you.

148
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,400
Actually,

149
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,200
for Eighth Prince to have a brother like you,

150
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,800
is more valuable than having anything else.

151
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,440
However, Imperial Father scolds me.

152
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,640
That's the brotherhood ties of those of Liangshan.

153
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,840
Fine, Hero of Lianghsan.

154
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:47,400
From what I see, you're sleepy and tired too.

155
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,640
Let me get things ready for you.

156
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,400
Once you're done eating, you can rest here.

157
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,800
Is it convenient?

158
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,120
Even if it isn't convenient, there's no choice.

159
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:54,760
Isn't that right?

160
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,280
Miss Ruoxi,

161
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,160
Your servant, Bao'zhu, was sent here by Bei'le

162
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,560
to send you medicine.

163
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:06,880
Please use warm water

164
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,440
to rinse before applying it on your wound

165
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,600
twice a day, once in the morning and another time at night.

166
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,160
After a few days, the clotted blood will have dissolved.

167
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,080
I got it.

168
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,440
Sorry to disturb you, miss. Your servant will take his leave now.

169
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,180
Please wait for a moment here.

170
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:22,200
Yes.

171
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,480
Fourteenth Prince, is this man trustworthy?

172
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,400
Yes.

173
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,960
Otherwise Eighth Brother wouldn't have sent him to give you the medicine.

174
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,680
Although it's not a matter of great importance,

175
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,600
Eighth Brother is always meticulous in matters concerning you.

176
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:41,040
Even at this moment, you're still in the mood to crack jokes.

177
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,320
Hold this!

178
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,200
Even though the servant is trustworthy,

179
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,720
I defied the Imperial decree to come here.

180
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,240
The less people who know about it, the better.

181
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,440
Otherwise, I wouldn't have come to find you either.

182
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,440
What does Bei'le usually do at night?

183
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,480
With regards to this, I can't say for sure.

184
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:04,440
Sometimes, he reads, sometimes, he plays chess by himself.

185
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,220
You can go back first.

186
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:07,120
Yes.

187
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:13,800
All right.

188
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,440
What do you plan to do?

189
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,920
Set up a way for you to meet Eighth Prince.

190
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,080
The sooner it is, the better.

191
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,040
Rest assured.

192
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:28,940
Official Li.

193
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:29,760
Here.

194
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,520
Official Li, please announce this on my behalf.

195
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,900
Suggestions:

196
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:49,220
Grand Secretary, Minister Zhang Donglai,

197
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:51,640
is posted to be Governor of Shanxi.

198
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:54,440
Li Shanzhi deployed to Hunan as governor.

199
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,120
Assistant Minister of Ministry Personnel, Hu Chong,

200
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:58,200
is promoted to Minister of Construction.

201
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,780
Assistant Minister of Defence, Deng Yunwen,

202
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:05,160
is temporarily transferred to take the post of Assistant Minister of Justice

203
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:09,160
to temporarily substitute for Minister Cheng who has gone back for a funeral.

204
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:12,540
What kind of transfers are these?

205
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:14,960
All these people have ties with Eighth Brother.

206
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:17,100
Obviously, he's taking the chance while Eighth Brother isn't in the capital

207
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,820
to get rid of Eighth Brother's allies.

208
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:20,680
So despicable.

209
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:21,600
Exactly.

210
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,200
Ninth Brother, is there something you want to say?

211
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,240
Of course!

212
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,200
Suddenly,

213
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,960
there's such big changes with so many officials.

214
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,920
Not only will this influence order in court,

215
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,600
moreover, I think

216
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,900
that someone is taking advantage of the fact Imperial Father is not in the capital

217
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:39,020
to take the chance to get rid of threats,

218
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:40,420
promoting one's personal agenda under the guise of public interest.

219
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:41,600
Ninth Brother,

220
00:12:42,244 --> 00:12:44,720
who are you referring to with these words?

221
00:12:45,084 --> 00:12:47,000
As a man, you should speak frankly,

222
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,520
why do you have to scold the locust while pointing at the mulberry (accuse people in a roundabout fashion)?

223
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:51,180
These changes were petitioned by the ministers,

224
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:53,520
and the decree has been agreed to by Imperial Father.

225
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,360
I'm just carrying them out according to the procedure

226
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,420
and following Imperial Father's wishes.

227
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:58,960
I'm definitely not doing it for personal benefit.

228
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,840
This is decreed by Imperial Father?

229
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,160
Imperial Father is on an expedition beyond the Great Wall.

230
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:05,640
I fear that someone is trying to sneakily carry out his own agenda.

231
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,840
If the two princes have any suspicions,

232
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,780
you can wait for Imperial Father to come back from the Great Wall

233
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:15,320
and ask him for yourself.

234
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,280
I've always held myself as a just person,

235
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:20,560
loyally carrying out Imperial Father's orders.

236
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,940
If someone is accusing me of sneakily carrying out my own agenda

237
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:25,480
and eradicating opponents,

238
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,200
then the people whom I'm eradicating,

239
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,300
are also those who are opposing Imperial Father,

240
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:31,040
those corrupt officials who abuse their power for self-profit.

241
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,400
Let me remind all those here.

242
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:39,658
No matter whether you're a Wangye, Bei'zi or an official,

243
00:13:39,658 --> 00:13:40,980
the thing Imperial Father hates the most

244
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:43,060
is us forming factions and colluding with each other.

245
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,240
If you're discovered by Imperial Father,

246
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,400
you'll definitely be severely punished.

247
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,800
Please remember this well.

248
00:13:50,942 --> 00:13:53,120
Oh yes, where has Fourteenth Brother gone?

249
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,580
Why didn't he come?

250
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,560
Fourteenth Brother's sick.

251
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,940
It's like this.

252
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:01,600
Fourteenth Brother went hunting a few days ago

253
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,700
and suddenly saw a fox

254
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:05,840
masquerading as a tiger.
(To borrow another's authority to throw one's weight about)

255
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,800
However,

256
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,280
he wasn't able to kill that fox

257
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:12,120
and was so upset, he was only able to quietly seethe to himself, and made himself ill from sulking.

258
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,200
Then please pass this on to Fourteenth Brother,

259
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,080
ask him to rest well.

260
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,100
As for the matters regarding this pack of foxes and dogs,
(unruly pack of rogues, a.k.a. the bad officials)

261
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:21,480
I won't let any one of them off.

262
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,120
Thirteenth Brother,

263
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,320
where are you rushing off to?

264
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,520
Fourth Brother, I'm going to find Fourteenth Brother.

265
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,800
I'm going to clear things up with him.

266
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,760
He needs to stop these shenanigans.

267
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,000
Fourth Brother,

268
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,520
both of you are born from the same mother.

269
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,880
You're biological brothers.

270
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,360
If he continues arguing with you in this manner,

271
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:43,120
your brotherly affection will be destroyed.

272
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:45,254
You don't need to go.

273
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:48,140
Precisely because we're brothers,

274
00:14:48,296 --> 00:14:49,744
even more reason you can't go to find him.

275
00:14:49,744 --> 00:14:51,060
Why?

276
00:14:52,073 --> 00:14:54,000
I'm afraid if you go to his residence and can't find him,

277
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,649
it will only create trouble.

278
00:14:56,091 --> 00:14:57,800
Fourth Brother, you mean...

279
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,565
Fourteenth Brother has already crossed the Great Wall

280
00:15:00,565 --> 00:15:02,440
to go see Eighth Brother?

281
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:04,775
This is violating the Imperial decree!

282
00:15:04,775 --> 00:15:06,300
It's a capital punishment!

283
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:07,560
Exactly because this is so

284
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:10,180
that's why you cannot go to find him.

285
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:11,280
If you can't find him,

286
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,440
this matter will definitely spread.

287
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,200
I'm afraid that it'll get him in trouble.

288
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:18,500
I really was too muddle-headed. Why didn't I think of this?

289
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:21,000
I just hope no one finds out about this

290
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,440
and he returns safely.

291
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,880
Fourth Brother, rest assured.

292
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:27,298
Fourteenth is smart and quick-witted, he will be fine.

293
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,760
It's getting late.

294
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:33,120
There are still people waiting for us.

295
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:42,240
Lüwu greets Fourth Prince and Thirteenth Prince.

296
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:44,220
We're making a private visit today.

297
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:46,440
Miss Lüwu, no need to be so formal.

298
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,140
Lüwu,

299
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:51,100
today is the first time my Fourth Brother has come.

300
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:52,740
You need to sing a tune for my Fourth Brother to listen to.

301
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:55,440
Fourth Brother, listen well.

302
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:59,840
Today, I'm not planning to sing.

303
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:03,940
The shows that you princes see in court are much better than mine.

304
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:06,600
I wouldn't dare to show off my paltry skills in front of an expert.

305
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,280
What a keen and insightful person.

306
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:15,000
Thirteenth Brother, your bosom female friend has both intelligence and good looks.

307
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,160
Fourth Prince, your praise is too exaggerated.

308
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,520
I am an ignorant woman,

309
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:22,680
who hopes to gain more pointers from the two princes.

310
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,400
Then if you're not singing today,

311
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,080
could it be that you have other plans?

312
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,320
In the palace, you two princes

313
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,920
live in the lap of luxury, and have eaten all sorts of delicacies,

314
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,120
nothing catches your eyes.

315
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:35,260
I can only brew a pot of tea

316
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:37,200
to let you try.

317
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,840
This tea is fragrant indeed.

318
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:44,080
Miss Lüwu is pretty good in the art of tea.

319
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:48,060
This was taught by a good friend of Thirteenth Prince.

320
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:49,400
Her skill in brewing tea

321
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,460
was learned from Ruoxi.

322
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:52,520
Ruoxi?

323
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,600
Miss Ruoxi is sincere and straightforward.

324
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,520
To be able to be her friend

325
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,480
is my fortune.

326
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,600
This Ruoxi can make friends with everyone.

327
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,960
except me, who she treats as if I were a monster, constantly staying on guard.

328
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,200
Doesn't that only prove

329
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,480
that she treats you

330
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,840
differently from others?

331
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:11,080
In her heart,

332
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:13,720
Fourth Brother is different from the others.

333
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:18,840
Miss Lüwu, there's a Mr. Yao who's come to visit.

334
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,440
Invite him in.

335
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,200
Yes.

336
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:27,790
I'm going to prepare some food and wine

337
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:29,430
so that you men can eat while talking.

338
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:41,950
Your servant, Nian Gengyao,

339
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:43,790
greets Master and Thirteenth Prince.

340
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:45,430
No need to be so formal. Rise.

341
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:47,590
Nian Gengyao,

342
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:50,710
it's been a long time since we last met, you've become thinner.

343
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:52,970
Is it because you were tired out from working under Fourth Brother.

344
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:54,410
Being able to work for Master

345
00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:56,270
is my fortune,

346
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:57,470
it isn't hard work.

347
00:17:58,350 --> 00:18:00,690
I know of everything of you've done.

348
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:02,770
I definitely won't treat you badly.

349
00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:04,390
As soon as there's a chance,

350
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:06,470
I'll nominate you to become the governor of Sichuan.

351
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:09,430
I don't dare to have any extravagant hopes.

352
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:10,910
Back then, when I was working under Eighth Prince,

353
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:12,310
I was maligned by crafty men

354
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:13,850
and was chased out by Eighth Prince.

355
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:15,490
Fortunately, Master stepped in to help,

356
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:18,030
which allowed me to keep my head intact.

357
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:19,830
Master is my savior,

358
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:21,030
my parents reborn.

359
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:22,670
As long as I can work for Master,

360
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:24,510
I'll be immensely grateful,

361
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:26,070
and would not ask for any other rewards.

362
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:29,170
Nian Gengyao, if Fourth Brother

363
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:30,630
nominates you to become the Governor of Sichuan,

364
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:32,670
you'll still have to work for us

365
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:34,470
and act as our eyes and ears.

366
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:35,750
This isn't a favour,

367
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:37,110
it's a hard job (with little profit).

368
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:38,850
To me, a hard job

369
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:40,310
is also a happy thing.

370
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:43,410
All right. Let's not joke anymore.

371
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:45,630
Gengyao, during this period while you were outside,

372
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:48,510
did you manage to discover if there's any communication between my Eighth Brother and the local officials?

373
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:52,070
Indeed, I found out some information.

374
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:59,730
You must have built up the good fortune of several lifetimes

375
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:01,410
to have Eighth Brother send you medicine,

376
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:03,910
and have me, Fourteenth Prince, to help you apply it.

377
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:06,950
I'm truly thankful to Fourteenth Prince.

378
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:09,870
But... wasn't Fourteenth Prince's food

379
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:11,830
also prepared by me?

380
00:19:12,670 --> 00:19:15,310
And I even had to risk my life to deliver messages on your behalf.

381
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:17,670
You sure do know how to claim credit.

382
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:20,590
It's done.

383
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:24,090
It's about time.

384
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:25,210
It's time for you to go too.

385
00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:26,590
Have you committed the place to memory?

386
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:30,710
Here, here, here. Everyone have a drink!

387
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:32,910
It's too cold, fill it to the brim.

388
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:33,370
Come.

389
00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:34,330
Warm your body.

390
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:37,170
Drink! Good. Come, drink.

391
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:39,970
Down it! Drink, drink, drink!

392
00:19:43,610 --> 00:19:46,510
Come, this is yours. Fine.

393
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:50,670
Miss Ruoxi.

394
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:56,350
Master, Miss Ruoxi is here.

395
00:19:57,130 --> 00:19:57,870
You may leave.

396
00:19:57,870 --> 00:19:59,070
Yes.

397
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:10,270
Are you still able to be on duty tomorrow?

398
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:18,710
Eighth Prince, is it convenient to speak here?

399
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:20,210
I knew you were coming tonight,

400
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:21,710
there are people on guard outside.

401
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:24,670
Fourteenth Prince is here.

402
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:27,390
Did he say what he came here for?

403
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:30,010
I've arranged a meeting spot.

404
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:31,750
It's in the forest to the west.

405
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:36,470
Go back first. I'll go see him.

406
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:43,630
Please be careful.

407
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:47,110
It's fine. Don't worry and go back.

408
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:51,090
You're worried for me.

409
00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:52,910
I'm very happy.

410
00:21:05,810 --> 00:21:07,450
It's your turn to be the night watch.

411
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:08,410
Don't be lazy.

412
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:09,770
Yes.

413
00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:14,010
Come, you fellows, go over there.

414
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:14,970
Yes.

415
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:16,290
You men take that side.

416
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:17,530
Yes.

417
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:23,470
Follow Eighth Prince and see what's going on.

418
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:24,450
I'll go back to report this.

419
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:25,530
Yes.

420
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:36,850
Eighth Brother.

421
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:40,870
It's me, Fourteenth Brother.

422
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:41,970
Fourteenth Brother,

423
00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:44,130
do you know that defying the Imperial decree to leave the capital is very dangerous?

424
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:46,010
If you get found out by Imperial Father or the Crown Prince,

425
00:21:46,010 --> 00:21:47,250
they definitely won't let you off easily.

426
00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:49,290
I don't care about any of that.

427
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:51,530
Eighth Brother,

428
00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:53,730
there's something I need to tell you.

429
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:56,450
Did something major happen in court?

430
00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:00,190
Recently, Fourth Brother

431
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:01,890
has been continuously passing Imperial Father's decrees

432
00:22:01,890 --> 00:22:03,730
to have all ministers who have connections with us

433
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:05,650
either deployed to faraway places,

434
00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:07,710
or transferred to do unimportant miscellaneous work.

435
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:10,510
He's deliberating weakening our strength.

436
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:12,110
That's why I took the risk to come here

437
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:14,210
in order to find Eighth Brother to discuss a countermeasure.

438
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:15,850
Otherwise, when you return to the capital,

439
00:22:15,850 --> 00:22:17,450
your advantage would definitely be lost.

440
00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:20,910
Don't be anxious.

441
00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:23,130
Tell me everything that happened in detail.

442
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:26,610
That day, Fourth Brother gathered all of us for a meeting,

443
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:28,770
saying that Imperial Father wants to change around the job postings of some ministers.

444
00:22:28,770 --> 00:22:30,530
The list was to be first made by Fourth Brother

445
00:22:30,530 --> 00:22:32,010
before it would be sent outside the Great Wall...

446
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:33,930
Master.

447
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:37,650
Reporting to Master,

448
00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:38,590
our men have discovered that

449
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:39,430
Eighth Prince

450
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:41,350
is indeed secretly meeting with a Mongol.

451
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:42,950
Upon closer observation,

452
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:44,330
this person appears to be

453
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:45,330
Fourteenth Prince.

454
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:48,150
Fourteenth Prince?

455
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:52,190
- Are you sure it's Fourteenth Prince?
- Yes

456
00:22:57,850 --> 00:22:58,770
Very good!

457
00:22:59,610 --> 00:23:01,090
Father had decreed

458
00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:03,610
that Eighth Prince is forbidden from making contact with the capital.

459
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:04,950
But now,

460
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:07,730
Fourteenth Prince actually came here against Imperial decree.

461
00:23:07,730 --> 00:23:10,410
And Eighth Prince is actually secretly meeting him.

462
00:23:10,410 --> 00:23:12,590
This is great!

463
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:14,790
It seems the opportunity for me to get my revenge has come.

464
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:15,570
Master,

465
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:17,070
should we report this to His Majesty?

466
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:17,770
There's no need.

467
00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:19,850
I have my own plans of what to do.

468
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:26,530
Tell me,

469
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:29,550
if thieves infiltrate the camp

470
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:32,230
and I shoot them with arrows,

471
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:34,210
wouldn't that be only natural?

472
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:40,130
I must make use of this chance

473
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:42,130
to get rid of Eighth and Fourteenth, these two thorns in my side.

474
00:23:42,770 --> 00:23:43,730
Send down my orders.

475
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:45,670
Have everyone prepare themselves.

476
00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:48,170
I'm going to kill some thieves.

477
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:49,410
Yes.

478
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:55,850
Nothing will happen.

479
00:23:56,730 --> 00:23:58,170
Eighth Prince is so intelligent,

480
00:23:58,790 --> 00:24:00,990
nothing should happen.

481
00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:04,050
Greetings to Princess.

482
00:24:04,050 --> 00:24:05,930
This is Miss Ruoxi's tent?

483
00:24:05,930 --> 00:24:07,450
Good. You're dismissed.

484
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:10,530
Ruoxi! I'm here to visit you.

485
00:24:10,530 --> 00:24:11,250
Greetings to Princess.

486
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:12,330
Get up.

487
00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:15,810
How are your hands?

488
00:24:15,810 --> 00:24:17,230
Thank you for your concern.

489
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:19,170
I just got a scare,

490
00:24:19,170 --> 00:24:20,530
I'm fine now.

491
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:23,510
Ruoxi,

492
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:24,870
there's some things I've been suppressing in my heart

493
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:26,450
that I'd like to discuss with someone.

494
00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:27,870
Give me some advice?

495
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:30,690
Princess, what matters would they be?

496
00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:32,170
It's a long story.

497
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:33,930
Would you be willing to take a walk with me?

498
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:36,770
Let's go!

499
00:24:38,050 --> 00:24:39,050
That works too.

500
00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:40,090
Let's go!

501
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:48,210
Suddenly visiting you at night, you wouldn't blame me for being too abrupt, would you?

502
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:51,210
You're straightforward and frank.

503
00:24:51,210 --> 00:24:52,990
Why are you suddenly being polite with me?

504
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:54,450
Because only now did I find out

505
00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:56,810
that you're a favourite of the Emperor.

506
00:24:56,810 --> 00:24:58,450
What favourite?

507
00:24:58,450 --> 00:25:01,130
I'm just serving His Majesty to the best of my abilities.

508
00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:05,370
Why didn't Thirteenth Prince

509
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:07,250
come along this time?

510
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:10,790
Whether or not he comes is not up to him.

511
00:25:10,790 --> 00:25:12,650
It depends on what His Majesty wants.

512
00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:15,070
But during this period,

513
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:16,810
Thirteenth Prince has been doing rather well.

514
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:19,370
I guess so.

515
00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:22,090
Thirteenth Prince's Fujin...

516
00:25:22,090 --> 00:25:23,970
is she beautiful?

517
00:25:26,530 --> 00:25:29,330
In my opinion, she isn't as beautiful as you.

518
00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:30,570
Really?

519
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:33,770
Don't you think that I'm crude and have no etiquette?

520
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:35,450
I know just by taking a look at you!

521
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:38,650
When you guys talk, you talk neither fast nor slow, neither too loud or too soft.

522
00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:40,890
And your actions are so refined and elegant.

523
00:25:40,890 --> 00:25:42,930
Whether or not I'm refined and elegant,

524
00:25:42,930 --> 00:25:44,170
I don't know.

525
00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:46,650
But I can tell you with certainty

526
00:25:46,650 --> 00:25:48,890
that you're a stunning beauty indeed.

527
00:25:50,530 --> 00:25:51,690
Actually,

528
00:25:51,690 --> 00:25:53,970
do you like Thirteenth Prince?

529
00:25:55,170 --> 00:25:56,970
Is it really that obvious?

530
00:25:56,970 --> 00:25:59,290
It's pretty obvious.

531
00:26:00,570 --> 00:26:03,130
That's right, I do like him.

532
00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:06,130
I've never heard such a beautiful voice.

533
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:09,290
He stood there, watching me sing

534
00:26:09,290 --> 00:26:12,290
My heart had never beat so fast before!

535
00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:14,530
And I'd never seen a man smile like that before.

536
00:26:14,530 --> 00:26:16,290
It was like he was smiling,

537
00:26:16,290 --> 00:26:18,370
but also like he wasn't smiling.

538
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:20,090
It was like he didn't have a care in the world,

539
00:26:20,090 --> 00:26:21,850
but also like a ball of fire,

540
00:26:21,850 --> 00:26:23,850
that you'd be able to feel his warmth.

541
00:26:24,530 --> 00:26:26,790
I've never seen a man like that!

542
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:30,530
Thirteenth Prince is indeed a person who is worthy of being liked.

543
00:26:31,570 --> 00:26:34,310
But my father won't let me marry hm.

544
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:35,690
Why?

545
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:40,410
I'll tell you but don't tell anyone else.

546
00:26:40,410 --> 00:26:42,910
My father says that the women in the Forbidden City (palace),

547
00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:44,670
that are happy, is not a large number.

548
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:47,010
He said that I'm a flower of the grasslands.

549
00:26:47,010 --> 00:26:49,410
I can only bloom in the grasslands.

550
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:55,530
Originally, I didn't want to believe Father's words,

551
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:57,230
but looking at your face now,

552
00:26:57,230 --> 00:26:58,530
it's true?

553
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:03,610
Sometimes, we're not able to do as we will.

554
00:27:03,610 --> 00:27:07,450
Then is liking someone, also something we're not able to do as we will?

555
00:27:19,090 --> 00:27:20,590
That way!

556
00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:21,470
Eighth Brother,

557
00:27:21,470 --> 00:27:23,730
you need to think of a way to return to the capital as soon as possible.

558
00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:26,970
Otherwise, when Fourth Brother has gained control of everything, it'll be too late.

559
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:30,330
That's exactly what Imperial Father wants. I definitely can't go back.

560
00:27:30,330 --> 00:27:32,130
We need to think of another plan.

561
00:27:55,530 --> 00:27:56,690
Careful!

562
00:28:00,130 --> 00:28:00,750
Shoot again!

563
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:01,570
Yes!

564
00:28:01,570 --> 00:28:02,850
Get out of the way!

565
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:10,050
They're just in front! Give chase!

566
00:28:10,050 --> 00:28:10,730
Yes!

567
00:28:12,370 --> 00:28:13,930
Could it be Imperial Father's men?

568
00:28:13,930 --> 00:28:15,410
Injuring people with sniper arrows. It's probably the Crown Prince.

569
00:28:15,410 --> 00:28:16,890
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

570
00:28:19,650 --> 00:28:21,170
Where are they?

571
00:28:21,170 --> 00:28:22,530
They were just here.

572
00:28:22,530 --> 00:28:25,050
Go over there and search.

573
00:28:29,090 --> 00:28:30,310
Ruoxi!

574
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:32,090
Do you have someone you like?

575
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:39,690
What happened?

576
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:41,190
Have they been discovered?

577
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:42,690
Hurry! Go over there and take a look!

578
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:43,890
Yes!

579
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:44,690
Quickly!

580
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:45,690
We need to catch the thieves!

581
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:46,570
Yes!

582
00:28:47,570 --> 00:28:49,430
- Wait! What happened?
- Princess.

583
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:50,670
Hurry get up and speak.

584
00:28:50,670 --> 00:28:51,850
The Crown Prince says there are thieves.

585
00:28:51,850 --> 00:28:53,230
He's ordered people to search everywhere.

586
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:55,270
Thieves?  What do they look like?

587
00:28:55,270 --> 00:28:56,730
I don't know what they look like.

588
00:28:56,730 --> 00:28:58,730
The Crown Prince says that the thief has already been shot by him,

589
00:28:58,730 --> 00:29:00,170
and has escaped into the camp.

590
00:29:00,170 --> 00:29:01,390
Fine, you may leave now.

591
00:29:01,390 --> 00:29:02,590
Yes.

592
00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:03,570
Take this.

593
00:29:04,050 --> 00:29:06,090
Princess, where can someone hide around this place?

594
00:29:06,090 --> 00:29:08,090
Hide someone? Why?

595
00:29:08,090 --> 00:29:10,330
Princess, I beg you to tell me first.

596
00:29:11,970 --> 00:29:14,330
Fine. Come with me.

597
00:29:22,150 --> 00:29:23,130
General,

598
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:25,830
the two suspicious people we were chasing after

599
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:27,610
definitely headed over in this direction.

600
00:29:27,610 --> 00:29:30,410
Crown Prince, you'd already did a thorough search before,

601
00:29:30,410 --> 00:29:31,570
and confirmed that there was nothing.

602
00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:33,850
If we don't press on while we're at an advantage,

603
00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:36,050
it's very possible that they'll escape.

604
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:42,530
Fine, since the Crown Prince puts it that way,

605
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:43,970
then let's search it one more time.

606
00:29:43,970 --> 00:29:45,290
Good.

607
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:47,510
The two of you, stay here.

608
00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:48,970
As for the rest, come with me to continue searching!

609
00:29:48,970 --> 00:29:50,250
Yes!

610
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:11,330
There's no one here. Let's go there and take a look. Let's go!

611
00:30:13,370 --> 00:30:14,810
Quickly, catch up!

612
00:30:14,810 --> 00:30:16,690
Go there to take a look! Yes!

613
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:19,690
Ruoxi!

614
00:30:24,170 --> 00:30:25,310
Fourteenth Prince.

615
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:27,250
Fourteenth Prince, were you injured?

616
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:29,630
I'm fine.

617
00:30:29,630 --> 00:30:30,990
What about Eighth Prince.

618
00:30:30,990 --> 00:30:32,450
We separated.

619
00:30:33,210 --> 00:30:35,570
Eighth Brother took an arrow for me.

620
00:30:36,810 --> 00:30:39,190
Ruoxi, don't worry.

621
00:30:39,190 --> 00:30:40,430
It's only an injury on the arm,

622
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:42,170
it's not life threatening.

623
00:30:43,770 --> 00:30:45,450
Ruoxi.

624
00:30:46,530 --> 00:30:48,010
Ruoxi.

625
00:30:48,970 --> 00:30:50,410
It's Princess Minmin.

626
00:30:52,850 --> 00:30:56,410
Fourteenth Prince, have you ever met Suwan Guwalgiya-Minmin?

627
00:30:58,690 --> 00:30:59,910
Ruoxi.

628
00:30:59,910 --> 00:31:00,930
Ruoxi!

629
00:31:02,210 --> 00:31:03,090
Don't worry.

630
00:31:03,090 --> 00:31:05,010
She will definitely help us.

631
00:31:07,810 --> 00:31:11,990
Princess Minmin. Princess Minmin.

632
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:13,570
Princess!

633
00:31:14,810 --> 00:31:16,090
Why are you...?

634
00:31:16,090 --> 00:31:17,690
Who is he?

635
00:31:17,690 --> 00:31:19,090
Princess, I beg you to save your servant's life.

636
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:20,650
What's wrong? Hurry and tell me.

637
00:31:20,650 --> 00:31:22,530
If I can help, I'll definitely help!

638
00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:25,210
I told you not to come but you insisted on following me here!

639
00:31:25,210 --> 00:31:26,090
Great!

640
00:31:26,090 --> 00:31:28,110
Now you've been mistaken as a thief by the Crown Prince, haven't you?

641
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:29,730
How are we to explain this?

642
00:31:29,730 --> 00:31:30,850
If we explain this,

643
00:31:30,850 --> 00:31:32,290
others will definitely know about this.

644
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:33,130
You know as well,

645
00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:35,090
palace maids aren't supposed to have trysts!

646
00:31:35,090 --> 00:31:36,610
You and I, we would both die.

647
00:31:36,610 --> 00:31:37,930
But if we don't explain,

648
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:39,730
you will still die.

649
00:31:39,730 --> 00:31:41,170
Then I...

650
00:31:41,970 --> 00:31:43,410
Then how am I to live alone by myself?

651
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:45,890
He's... your lover?

652
00:31:48,570 --> 00:31:50,730
Normally in the palace, we aren't allowed to see each other.

653
00:31:50,730 --> 00:31:53,090
We thought we'd have a chance when we came north of the Great Wall.

654
00:31:53,090 --> 00:31:54,210
Who'd have thought

655
00:31:54,210 --> 00:31:56,990
he'd be mistaken for a thief by the Crown Prince.

656
00:31:56,990 --> 00:31:58,970
He stood the risk of being executed to come see you,

657
00:31:58,970 --> 00:32:00,850
how can you still blame him?

658
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:03,150
Don't worry!

659
00:32:03,150 --> 00:32:04,410
Leave this to me.

660
00:32:04,410 --> 00:32:05,970
I will definitely make sure he's safe.

661
00:32:06,450 --> 00:32:07,930
Princess Minmin,

662
00:32:07,930 --> 00:32:09,170
if there's a chance,

663
00:32:09,170 --> 00:32:10,610
I will definitely repay you.

664
00:32:10,610 --> 00:32:11,510
Don't worry about it.

665
00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:13,730
Ruoxi, you don't need to worry.

666
00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:16,730
Thank you so much, Princess Minmin.

667
00:32:16,730 --> 00:32:18,570
Enough, hurry and come with me.

668
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:24,290
Princess Minmin, I'm sorry.

669
00:32:27,090 --> 00:32:28,370
In order to see Ruoxi,

670
00:32:28,370 --> 00:32:29,650
you took such a big risk,

671
00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:31,290
are you afraid at all?

672
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:33,090
I'm not.

673
00:32:33,090 --> 00:32:35,910
For Ruoxi's sake, how could I be afraid?

674
00:32:35,910 --> 00:32:37,970
Then to see each other at the palace,

675
00:32:37,970 --> 00:32:39,450
is it really that difficult?

676
00:32:39,930 --> 00:32:43,090
It's difficult. Palace rules are very strict,

677
00:32:43,090 --> 00:32:45,610
not like your desert grasslands, where you can do as you please.

678
00:32:46,050 --> 00:32:47,510
Then, for Ruoxi,

679
00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:49,230
you must have endured many hardships too, haven't you?

680
00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:50,790
It's hard.

681
00:32:50,790 --> 00:32:52,450
But for Ruoxi,

682
00:32:53,450 --> 00:32:55,650
it was all worth it.

683
00:32:58,690 --> 00:33:00,890
Princess, I should go back now.

684
00:33:00,890 --> 00:33:02,090
If I stay any longer,

685
00:33:02,090 --> 00:33:03,490
I'm afraid I'll draw others' attention.

686
00:33:03,490 --> 00:33:05,130
All right, rest assured.

687
00:33:05,130 --> 00:33:08,130
Tomorrow, I'll definitely return you a whole and healthy lover.

688
00:33:08,130 --> 00:33:09,330
Thank you, Princess.

689
00:33:09,330 --> 00:33:10,690
No need for thanks.

690
00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:20,110
Go over there to look! Yes!

691
00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:21,651
Hurry hurry! Is there anyone over there?

692
00:33:21,651 --> 00:33:22,890
There isn't anyone over here either!

693
00:33:22,890 --> 00:33:24,150
This place has been searched! There's nothing!

694
00:33:24,150 --> 00:33:26,210
Go look over there! Yes, there!

695
00:33:26,470 --> 00:33:28,690
Fourteenth Prince should be safe for tonight.

696
00:33:28,690 --> 00:33:30,770
I'll go find Eighth Prince first.

697
00:33:31,490 --> 00:33:33,270
Reporting to the Crown Prince, we haven't found them.

698
00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:34,470
How can this be?

699
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:35,590
Continue searching!

700
00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:36,730
Yes!

701
00:33:36,730 --> 00:33:37,650
Many thanks, Princess.

702
00:33:37,650 --> 00:33:39,290
What's there to thank? Do sit down.

703
00:33:39,290 --> 00:33:40,750
Can I sit here?

704
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:42,550
Where does all this etiquette come from?

705
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:44,130
Sit here.

706
00:33:46,130 --> 00:33:47,250
Hurry and tell me,

707
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:48,941
when did you two get to know each other?

708
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:53,430
Back then,

709
00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:55,930
we got to know each other at Bei'le's residence.

710
00:33:56,690 --> 00:33:59,210
Just nice, I had to go to Bei'le's residence to run some errands.

711
00:33:59,210 --> 00:34:00,770
It was there that I met her.

712
00:34:00,770 --> 00:34:03,330
Back then, she hadn't entered the palace yet,

713
00:34:03,330 --> 00:34:04,730
and was a spitfire.

714
00:34:04,730 --> 00:34:07,670
Her opinions and actions were rebellious and unorthodox.

715
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:09,218
I wouldn't have known!

716
00:34:09,218 --> 00:34:11,010
But this is possible!

717
00:34:11,930 --> 00:34:13,070
Crown Prince, we didn't find anyone.

718
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:14,529
I didn't find anyone either.

719
00:34:15,250 --> 00:34:16,329
Outrageous!

720
00:34:16,329 --> 00:34:18,490
What were you men doing?

721
00:34:18,490 --> 00:34:19,893
How could you not find them?

722
00:34:22,930 --> 00:34:23,969
Crown Prince,

723
00:34:23,969 --> 00:34:26,070
perhaps you saw wrongly?

724
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:27,690
If we continue searching like this,

725
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:29,849
I'm afraid that it'll alarm our King.

726
00:34:29,849 --> 00:34:32,210
Come that time, the one who will be held responsible,

727
00:34:32,210 --> 00:34:34,969
I'm afraid it won't be the Crown Prince anymore, will it?

728
00:34:37,330 --> 00:34:38,529
General,

729
00:34:38,529 --> 00:34:42,449
I'm also only doing it out of concern for everyone's safety.

730
00:34:43,610 --> 00:34:45,009
All right then,

731
00:34:46,130 --> 00:34:48,250
since we aren't able to find them today,

732
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:50,330
then we shan't disturb anymore for now.

733
00:34:50,823 --> 00:34:52,930
Crown Prince, if you please.

734
00:34:53,969 --> 00:34:56,370
Let's go!

735
00:35:09,013 --> 00:35:10,010
Miss Ruoxi,

736
00:35:10,010 --> 00:35:11,450
Bei'le is washing up right now,

737
00:35:11,450 --> 00:35:13,250
and it isn't convenient for him to receive guests.

738
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:19,010
Miss Ruoxi, please.

739
00:35:26,646 --> 00:35:28,210
Come in.

740
00:35:32,126 --> 00:35:33,850
Come here.

741
00:35:41,985 --> 00:35:43,091
Master,

742
00:35:43,091 --> 00:35:46,610
I'm going to reapply the ointment for you.

743
00:35:51,403 --> 00:35:52,657
Master.

744
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:06,650
What kind of crappy medicine is this?

745
00:36:06,650 --> 00:36:08,090
Why isn't the blood stopping yet?

746
00:36:08,090 --> 00:36:10,130
This is already top-grade medicine for wounds.

747
00:36:10,130 --> 00:36:10,940
It was Ninth Prince who spent a great sum of gold

748
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:13,198
to buy this from Yunnan.

749
00:36:13,198 --> 00:36:15,890
This time, we specially brought it here just in case.

750
00:36:15,890 --> 00:36:19,221
No matter how good the medicine is, it still needs time for it to take effect.

751
00:36:19,221 --> 00:36:20,661
You specially brought it just in case?

752
00:36:21,490 --> 00:36:23,726
What kind of preparations have you been making?

753
00:36:25,755 --> 00:36:27,690
You've seen Fourteenth Brother?

754
00:36:59,726 --> 00:37:01,850
Master, the ointment has been reapplied.

755
00:37:01,850 --> 00:37:03,455
Your servant takes his leave now.

756
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:11,573
Does it hurt?

757
00:37:14,617 --> 00:37:16,390
You don't need to worry about Fourteenth Prince.

758
00:37:16,390 --> 00:37:18,150
He's totally fine.

759
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:20,932
Since you're fine, I'll leave first.

760
00:37:24,044 --> 00:37:24,810
If you use anymore force,

761
00:37:24,810 --> 00:37:27,790
my wound will need to be re-bandaged.

762
00:37:45,476 --> 00:37:47,752
Everything is like a dream.

763
00:38:06,258 --> 00:38:07,430
Sit.

764
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:15,350
All along, I've been thinking, we...

765
00:38:15,350 --> 00:38:17,543
How did you know I've seen Fourteenth Prince?

766
00:38:17,543 --> 00:38:19,470
Aren't you worried about him?

767
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:22,680
You saw that I was injured

768
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:25,030
but weren't shocked.

769
00:38:25,030 --> 00:38:27,342
It's clear you already knew about it.

770
00:38:27,342 --> 00:38:29,710
Then, it could only have been Fourteenth Brother who told you.

771
00:38:30,151 --> 00:38:31,898
As for worrying about him,

772
00:38:31,898 --> 00:38:34,020
there aren't only the Crown Prince's men here.

773
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:35,274
His people can search,

774
00:38:35,274 --> 00:38:37,842
can't our people help to hide then?

775
00:38:37,842 --> 00:38:39,546
Until now, there hasn't been anyone coming to bring news,

776
00:38:39,546 --> 00:38:43,036
that means that everything's fine.

777
00:38:43,036 --> 00:38:44,130
Besides,

778
00:38:44,130 --> 00:38:45,569
since you've seen Fourteenth Brother,

779
00:38:45,569 --> 00:38:47,302
and you don't have worry written on your face,

780
00:38:47,302 --> 00:38:50,460
that means he's already safely hidden.

781
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:52,767
I really can't hide anything from you, Eighth Prince.

782
00:38:52,767 --> 00:38:56,132
You're very meticulous as well, being able to think of everything.

783
00:38:56,132 --> 00:38:58,097
Not completely either.

784
00:38:58,097 --> 00:39:01,034
That's right, how were you discovered by the Crown Prince?

785
00:39:03,054 --> 00:39:05,237
When I left, I was already very careful.

786
00:39:06,769 --> 00:39:08,255
It could be the Crown Prince

787
00:39:08,255 --> 00:39:11,134
was guarding against me communicating with those in the capital recently,

788
00:39:11,738 --> 00:39:13,456
and had already increased the number of men

789
00:39:13,456 --> 00:39:14,989
patrolling the area.

790
00:39:14,989 --> 00:39:16,436
What happened in the capital?

791
00:39:16,436 --> 00:39:17,915
Why would he need to be on guard?

792
00:39:18,649 --> 00:39:21,853
Imperial Father has forbidden me from communicating with those in the capital.

793
00:39:21,853 --> 00:39:23,664
The Crown Prince made these preparations...

794
00:39:23,664 --> 00:39:26,390
One, to have a handle on me

795
00:39:26,390 --> 00:39:28,805
and report me for not being respectful and defying an Imperial decree.

796
00:39:28,805 --> 00:39:31,080
Two, it's that recently, Imperial Father

797
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:33,635
is planning to make big changes in official duties,

798
00:39:34,285 --> 00:39:36,003
which according to what Fourteenth Brother said,

799
00:39:36,003 --> 00:39:37,582
are mostly disadvantageous toward us.

800
00:39:38,302 --> 00:39:39,370
Naturally, the Crown Prince doesn't want me

801
00:39:39,370 --> 00:39:41,149
to make any countermeasures against it now.

802
00:39:41,149 --> 00:39:43,006
And when I return back to the capital in September,

803
00:39:43,006 --> 00:39:45,243
everything will be set and unchangeable.

804
00:39:45,243 --> 00:39:47,650
If the Emperor has already made his decision,

805
00:39:47,650 --> 00:39:49,726
what can you fellows do?

806
00:39:51,909 --> 00:39:54,695
These matters are lengthy and complicated to explain.

807
00:39:54,695 --> 00:39:56,081
To make a long story short,

808
00:39:56,081 --> 00:39:57,667
even if you´re the Emperor,

809
00:39:57,667 --> 00:40:00,407
you still can't really do as you please.

810
00:40:03,844 --> 00:40:05,283
If you really want to know,

811
00:40:05,283 --> 00:40:07,698
I'm willing to slowly explain it to you.

812
00:40:10,538 --> 00:40:12,814
Where is Fourteenth Brother hidden?

813
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:15,593
Guess.

814
00:40:16,870 --> 00:40:18,717
Since you want me to guess,

815
00:40:18,717 --> 00:40:21,143
it must be a person that I wouldn't easily think of.

816
00:40:22,025 --> 00:40:23,604
Princess Minmin?

817
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:27,737
Yes.

818
00:40:27,737 --> 00:40:29,177
It's really her?

819
00:40:29,177 --> 00:40:30,509
How did you convince her?

820
00:40:30,509 --> 00:40:32,381
This isn't a small matter.

821
00:40:33,417 --> 00:40:34,717
I won't tell you.

822
00:40:38,743 --> 00:40:40,229
How can the Crown Prince be so daring?

823
00:40:40,229 --> 00:40:42,194
He actually used arrows to shoot at you both.

824
00:40:42,194 --> 00:40:45,607
It's only natural to shoot thieves with arrows.

825
00:40:45,607 --> 00:40:47,451
Using this opportunity to get rid of us,

826
00:40:47,451 --> 00:40:48,890
wouldn't that be the best?

827
00:40:50,957 --> 00:40:52,861
This is only the beginning.

828
00:40:52,861 --> 00:40:54,533
When Fourth Prince ascends the throne,

829
00:40:54,533 --> 00:40:56,623
that will be real suffering.

830
00:40:58,202 --> 00:41:00,877
I don't like how you were just now.

831
00:41:00,877 --> 00:41:02,649
It makes me feel

832
00:41:02,649 --> 00:41:04,657
like you're really far away.

833
00:41:05,516 --> 00:41:07,373
What's in your heart?

834
00:41:09,967 --> 00:41:11,228
You're scared?

835
00:41:18,837 --> 00:41:23,202
Don't be scared, for anything, there's me.

836
00:41:23,202 --> 00:41:25,624
I won't let any harm come upon you.

837
00:41:39,403 --> 00:41:41,560
Inform all the patrols, there's no need to search anymore!

838
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:42,078
Yes!

839
00:41:42,078 --> 00:41:43,311
Return to your positions!

840
00:41:43,311 --> 00:41:44,525
Yes!

841
00:41:44,525 --> 00:41:45,640
From this point on,

842
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:47,544
there's no need for me to send you off anymore, is there?

843
00:41:48,241 --> 00:41:49,030
Fine.

844
00:41:49,857 --> 00:41:51,011
Thanks.

845
00:41:51,011 --> 00:41:52,583
Farewell then.

846
00:41:57,366 --> 00:41:58,341
Let's go.

847
00:42:00,408 --> 00:42:02,683
Just now, did you men see clearly

848
00:42:02,683 --> 00:42:04,309
that after Fourteenth was injured,

849
00:42:04,309 --> 00:42:06,066
he really escaped to the Mongol's campsite?

850
00:42:06,066 --> 00:42:07,885
Master, I can't say for sure either

851
00:42:07,885 --> 00:42:09,139
that it's definitely Fourteenth Prince.

852
00:42:09,139 --> 00:42:11,507
But they definitely escaped here.

853
00:42:13,922 --> 00:42:15,687
Since you saw it,

854
00:42:15,687 --> 00:42:17,823
then he must be here.

855
00:42:18,294 --> 00:42:19,066
Master.

856
00:42:19,066 --> 00:42:21,120
Just now, they'd already brought us around and searched once through.

857
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:22,467
If we search again,

858
00:42:22,467 --> 00:42:23,846
wouldn't it be going a little overboard?

859
00:42:23,846 --> 00:42:25,857
This is a rare great opportunity,

860
00:42:25,857 --> 00:42:26,825
we definitely can't let it slip.

861
00:42:26,825 --> 00:42:28,736
Master, we can't do this for the time being yet.

862
00:42:28,736 --> 00:42:29,765
If we're discovered by them,

863
00:42:29,765 --> 00:42:31,305
they will certainly report this to His Majesty.

864
00:42:31,305 --> 00:42:32,916
I'll take responsibility for it if His Majesty asks about it.

865
00:42:32,916 --> 00:42:34,355
What's there for you all to be afraid of?

866
00:42:35,547 --> 00:42:37,079
Yes.

867
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:40,323
Just now, we searched pretty much everywhere,

868
00:42:41,459 --> 00:42:43,992
it was only Minmin's tent that we didn't enter.

869
00:42:43,992 --> 00:42:45,385
But the Princess had ordered

870
00:42:45,385 --> 00:42:46,583
that no one was allowed to enter.

871
00:42:48,584 --> 00:42:51,170
If there's nothing she has to hide,

872
00:42:51,170 --> 00:42:52,978
why won't she let us in?

873
00:42:53,489 --> 00:42:57,111
Who knows, Fourteenth might really be hiding in her tent.

874
00:42:57,630 --> 00:42:58,597
You go over there to keep watch.

875
00:42:58,597 --> 00:42:59,897
We need to be more vigilant in our watch tonight!

876
00:42:59,897 --> 00:43:01,337
Yes!

877
00:43:02,359 --> 00:43:03,713
Stop worrying!

878
00:43:03,713 --> 00:43:05,345
I promised Ruoxi to protect you

879
00:43:05,345 --> 00:43:06,863
so nothing's going to happen for sure.

880
00:43:07,374 --> 00:43:09,750
Princess, if the Crown Prince isn't able to find me,

881
00:43:09,750 --> 00:43:11,893
he definitely isn't going to give up easily.

882
00:43:11,893 --> 00:43:13,551
This is the campsite of us Mongolians.

883
00:43:13,551 --> 00:43:15,237
Would he dare mess around?

884
00:43:15,237 --> 00:43:16,623
Go and rest early.

885
00:43:16,623 --> 00:43:18,473
I'll help keep your head safe.

886
00:43:19,843 --> 00:43:21,980
Go over there to look!

887
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:23,048
Someone's coming.

888
00:43:24,998 --> 00:43:26,670
Hide behind the screen and don't come out.

889
00:43:54,673 --> 00:43:56,345
I'll kill you! I'll kill you!

890
00:43:56,345 --> 00:43:57,181
Stop!

891
00:43:57,181 --> 00:43:58,621
How dare you try to forcefully barge into the Princess's tent?

892
00:43:58,621 --> 00:44:00,292
Move aside!  The Crown Prince is inside.

893
00:44:00,292 --> 00:44:02,470
Absurd! The Crown Prince just left,

894
00:44:02,470 --> 00:44:03,636
how could he be inside the tent?

895
00:44:03,636 --> 00:44:04,751
If you continue to talk rubbish,

896
00:44:04,751 --> 00:44:05,958
I won't hold back on you!

897
00:44:05,958 --> 00:44:06,483
You!

898
00:44:06,483 --> 00:44:08,002
Don't you hear the sounds of fighting coming from inside?

899
00:44:08,419 --> 00:44:09,534
The Princess strictly ordered

900
00:44:09,534 --> 00:44:10,509
that no matter what sounds of activity there are,

901
00:44:10,509 --> 00:44:12,738
no one is allowed to enter the tent!

902
00:44:13,667 --> 00:44:14,828
Don't hit anymore!

903
00:44:15,664 --> 00:44:16,918
Scram!

904
00:44:16,918 --> 00:44:19,194
Crown Prince!

905
00:44:19,194 --> 00:44:21,190
That's the Crown Prince?

906
00:44:22,351 --> 00:44:23,745
Too audacious!

907
00:44:27,553 --> 00:44:29,596
You dare to lay your hands on me, the Crown Prince?

908
00:44:30,060 --> 00:44:31,779
Just now, it was pitch black inside.

909
00:44:31,779 --> 00:44:33,822
I thought it was the thief that the Crown Prince was talking about.

910
00:44:33,822 --> 00:44:35,494
Who would have thought that it was the Crown Prince himself searching for the person,

911
00:44:35,494 --> 00:44:37,212
and even expanding the search to my tent?

912
00:44:37,212 --> 00:44:39,395
I was also only doing it out of concern for the Princess's safety.

913
00:44:39,395 --> 00:44:41,206
Thank you then.

914
00:44:41,206 --> 00:44:43,203
If there's nothing else, I'll go back inside now.

915
00:44:44,921 --> 00:44:45,804
Stand aside!

916
00:44:45,804 --> 00:44:47,104
Come back.

917
00:44:54,813 --> 00:44:55,788
Let's go.

918
00:45:00,161 --> 00:45:01,925
Princess, your plan was brilliant.

919
00:45:01,925 --> 00:45:04,254
Even the Crown Prince is speechless after being beaten by you.

920
00:45:04,254 --> 00:45:07,027
He actually dared to forcefully barge in. I'm not someone to be trifled with.

921
00:45:07,027 --> 00:45:08,420
Not only are you smart,

922
00:45:09,325 --> 00:45:11,415
your fighting skills have also made me see you in a whole new light.

923
00:45:11,415 --> 00:45:14,759
That's a matter of course! We, the children of the desert, aren't people you can easily bully.

924
00:45:15,339 --> 00:45:17,522
I promised Ruoxi that I'll keep you safe,

925
00:45:17,522 --> 00:45:18,869
so I will definitely do it!

926
00:45:19,494 --> 00:45:21,126
Many thanks, Princess.

927
00:45:21,934 --> 00:45:22,881
Then, continue to tell me

928
00:45:22,881 --> 00:45:25,217
about you and Ruoxi.

929
00:45:25,217 --> 00:45:26,439
All right.

930
00:45:29,945 --> 00:45:31,570
I really can't guess

931
00:45:31,570 --> 00:45:34,260
what you're always thinking about.

932
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:36,071
Promise me,

933
00:45:36,071 --> 00:45:38,350
from now on, don't let your imagination go wild again.

934
00:45:40,115 --> 00:45:43,412
Master, our people have reported

935
00:45:43,412 --> 00:45:44,991
that the Crown Prince has flipped the Mongol campsite

936
00:45:44,991 --> 00:45:46,942
inside out, searching it through three times.

937
00:45:46,942 --> 00:45:49,403
The surrounding area has also been searched upside down.

938
00:45:49,403 --> 00:45:50,882
There was no results at all.

939
00:45:50,882 --> 00:45:53,629
Now, he's preparing to search the campsite here.

940
00:45:54,929 --> 00:45:56,555
He really is going all out.

941
00:45:56,555 --> 00:45:58,598
He's not even afraid of disturbing Imperial Father.

942
00:45:58,598 --> 00:46:00,484
But he's come at just the right moment.

943
00:46:00,484 --> 00:46:02,753
I'll let him help me by acting as my witness.

944
00:46:02,753 --> 00:46:04,868
Eighth Prince is going to see the Crown Prince?

945
00:46:04,868 --> 00:46:06,284
How will you be able to hide your injury?

946
00:46:06,284 --> 00:46:07,870
Even if you're able to hide it tonight,

947
00:46:07,870 --> 00:46:09,663
what about tomorrow or the day after that?

948
00:46:09,663 --> 00:46:11,035
Once you get on the horse,

949
00:46:11,035 --> 00:46:12,978
the wound will definitely start bleeding.

950
00:46:12,978 --> 00:46:14,936
If the Crown Prince finds out,,

951
00:46:14,936 --> 00:46:17,708
he'll definitely report it to His Majesty and make a big fuss over it.

952
00:46:18,751 --> 00:46:22,095
Ruoxi, believe me, don't worry.

953
00:46:22,654 --> 00:46:25,255
Li Fu, go brew hot tea.

954
00:46:25,255 --> 00:46:27,737
Remember, it has to be boiling hot.

955
00:46:27,737 --> 00:46:29,223
Yes.

956
00:46:43,515 --> 00:46:46,083
Master, the tea is ready.

957
00:46:46,719 --> 00:46:47,941
Good.

958
00:46:55,494 --> 00:46:56,734
Not hot enough.

959
00:46:56,734 --> 00:46:58,691
What I want is for it to be boiling hot.

960
