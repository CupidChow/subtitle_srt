00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:19,770
♫  In the blink of an eye, a thought of stubborn persistence  ♫

3
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:24,300
♫  We were destined to seek our doom like moths flying towards the flame  ♫

4
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:30,540
♫  Knowing that it’d be a disaster, why am I still at a loss about what to do  ♫

5
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:39,050
♫  The best is not to see, the best is not to miss you  ♫

6
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:43,900
♫  Only like this can I not be in love with you  ♫

7
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:48,170
♫  Just another brushing of the shoulder, and from then...♫

8
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:53,100
♫  I’ll keep falling deeper and deeper in love with you  ♫

9
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,200
♫  It’s the mistake of time, ♫

10
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:01,900
♫ forcing us to pass each other by  ♫

11
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:05,370
♫  How I miss you, how far you are  ♫

12
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:07,930
♫  Even though I’d known it’d only result in pain,  ♫

13
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:11,910
♫ at this moment, I still don’t want to escape   ♫

14
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:16,020
♫  Pity these words are too glaring, they hurt the eyes  ♫

15
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:21,660
♫  Two worlds later ♫

16
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:25,290
♫  Don’t want to escape  ♫

17
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:27,940
♫  It’s the mistake of time,  ♫

18
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,540
♫  we can only pass each other by  ♫

19
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:35,300
♫  The magnitude of me missing you is as much as how far you are   ♫

20
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:41,310
♫  Even though I know the ending is a mistake that I cannot oppose  ♫

21
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,400
♫  Staying in this moment  ♫

22
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:55,020
♫  We can only accept that the feelings run deep, but fate is shallow  ♫

23
00:01:58,988 --> 00:02:01,953
Scarlet Heart
Episode 25

24
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:13,510
You may all leave.

25
00:02:14,882 --> 00:02:18,386
Ruo'xi, I have some things to say to you.

26
00:02:18,899 --> 00:02:20,640
After you were switched to washing clothes,

27
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,120
did you also wash your brains into a mess?

28
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,740
This is your best opportunity.

29
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:27,674
You need to grab it.

30
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:30,398
If you do not grab it,

31
00:02:30,398 --> 00:02:32,409
even if I wanted to help you

32
00:02:32,409 --> 00:02:34,480
I wouldn't be able to.

33
00:02:34,849 --> 00:02:37,682
I know that Eunuch Li treats me well.

34
00:02:38,411 --> 00:02:40,282
I don't dare to do it again.

35
00:02:42,372 --> 00:02:46,412
In the Palace, you are a smart person.

36
00:02:46,412 --> 00:02:49,803
This time, even though I made the decision privately,

37
00:02:49,803 --> 00:02:53,378
I could not do that without the Emperor's special favor.

38
00:02:54,307 --> 00:02:57,558
You must not continue in doing the wrong thing.

39
00:02:58,394 --> 00:02:59,416
Yes.

40
00:03:02,829 --> 00:03:05,520
I have a question in my heart,

41
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:08,216
but I don't know if I can ask  Eunuch Li.

42
00:03:08,913 --> 00:03:10,259
You may ask.

43
00:03:10,659 --> 00:03:13,928
Eunuch Li has always understood the Emperor's thoughts.

44
00:03:13,928 --> 00:03:15,368
Do you think

45
00:03:15,368 --> 00:03:17,550
the person that HIs Majesty supports in his heart

46
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:20,340
is the 4th Prince or the 14th Prince?

47
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:23,713
I just said that you needed to be careful in your actions and words.

48
00:03:23,713 --> 00:03:26,720
Did you even hear what I said?

49
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,574
I already said we are servants.

50
00:03:32,574 --> 00:03:34,849
We can't get involved with Palace issues.

51
00:03:34,849 --> 00:03:36,753
Even if you let me guess

52
00:03:36,753 --> 00:03:39,122
I do not have a clear answer.

53
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:43,278
Both brothers are doted on by the Emperor.

54
00:03:43,278 --> 00:03:46,622
Also the Emperor has said before

55
00:03:46,622 --> 00:03:50,105
everything is under his control.

56
00:03:50,105 --> 00:03:53,054
All this time, in order to suppress any struggles,

57
00:03:53,054 --> 00:03:54,920
he has decided not to appoint a Crown Prince.

58
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,783
Not until the very last moment,

59
00:03:56,783 --> 00:04:00,809
will the Emperor announce who the successor is.

60
00:04:01,809 --> 00:04:04,617
Your Majesty, please look after your health.

61
00:04:04,617 --> 00:04:07,357
Don't tire yourself out so much.

62
00:04:08,432 --> 00:04:11,412
As long as I can see the country prosper and the common people at peace,

63
00:04:11,683 --> 00:04:14,145
that they have food to eat and clothes to wear,

64
00:04:14,145 --> 00:04:16,645
it does not matter how tired I am, it is worthy.

65
00:04:16,645 --> 00:04:17,899
However, I

66
00:04:17,899 --> 00:04:20,267
could not help the Emperor with his worries.

67
00:04:21,963 --> 00:04:24,656
You already helped me

68
00:04:24,835 --> 00:04:26,699
All these years,

69
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:29,864
you have served me dutifully

70
00:04:29,864 --> 00:04:32,644
and I am completely aware of it.

71
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:36,243
I would not dare to create trouble for the Emperor.

72
00:04:37,164 --> 00:04:39,540
I only hoped 14th Prince

73
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:42,001
could come back earlier

74
00:04:42,001 --> 00:04:45,949
so the Emperor can feel relieved.

75
00:04:45,949 --> 00:04:48,549
The 14th prince is braver than other people.

76
00:04:48,549 --> 00:04:50,871
I am confident in him.

77
00:04:50,871 --> 00:04:55,097
This is all due to your contribution.

78
00:04:55,097 --> 00:04:57,234
I could not dare to accept the credit.

79
00:04:57,932 --> 00:05:00,090
I only hope that 4th Prince

80
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:01,506
and 14th Prince

81
00:05:01,506 --> 00:05:03,424
can help Your Majesty with his worries and issues,

82
00:05:03,424 --> 00:05:06,443
then I will be satisfied.

83
00:05:07,358 --> 00:05:09,122
Out of these two brothers,

84
00:05:09,122 --> 00:05:11,840
which one do you favor?

85
00:05:13,302 --> 00:05:14,741
The two of them

86
00:05:14,741 --> 00:05:16,831
are both my sons.

87
00:05:16,831 --> 00:05:19,060
There is no difference.

88
00:05:19,318 --> 00:05:21,197
To me,

89
00:05:21,197 --> 00:05:25,307
you are stricter with the 4th Prince.

90
00:05:25,307 --> 00:05:26,328
That's right.

91
00:05:26,528 --> 00:05:28,040
I only wish

92
00:05:28,443 --> 00:05:32,458
he can be a good role model for 14th Prince.

93
00:05:32,616 --> 00:05:34,200
Did you know

94
00:05:35,268 --> 00:05:37,497
sometimes I suspected

95
00:05:38,008 --> 00:05:41,352
that silent and reticent character of 4th Prince,

96
00:05:41,523 --> 00:05:43,120
just because you

97
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,903
were so strict with him.

98
00:05:45,903 --> 00:05:47,575
Your Majesty!

99
00:05:48,225 --> 00:05:49,840
My skill of guidance is lacking

100
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,708
and I caused torment in the princes.

101
00:05:51,708 --> 00:05:54,448
There can not be enough punishment for me.

102
00:05:54,448 --> 00:05:56,080
Don't talk about faults.

103
00:05:56,616 --> 00:05:58,840
As a father,

104
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:02,041
my fault is even greater.

105
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,431
Well.  The Emperor handles tens of thousands of matters each day,

106
00:06:05,431 --> 00:06:07,546
who has that much time?

107
00:06:07,546 --> 00:06:09,192
That is why

108
00:06:09,192 --> 00:06:11,886
if the child was not bought up right, it was the father's fault.

109
00:06:13,497 --> 00:06:16,808
Unfortunately, the ruler of a country

110
00:06:16,808 --> 00:06:18,062
can not be the same as

111
00:06:18,805 --> 00:06:21,160
a regular person.

112
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:25,720
Going out to work after sunrise and coming home for rest after sunset.

113
00:06:26,352 --> 00:06:27,722
Every night

114
00:06:27,722 --> 00:06:29,758
sitting under a big tree,

115
00:06:29,758 --> 00:06:33,155
they can accompany their children, cool off, and tell stories.

116
00:06:36,592 --> 00:06:41,250
Sometimes, if one of them was sick

117
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:43,929
I couldn't even go to see him.

118
00:06:45,462 --> 00:06:48,016
The princes will understand.

119
00:06:49,967 --> 00:06:53,578
There are times where I can not be clear.

120
00:06:53,578 --> 00:06:57,249
Do they truly have filial piety towards me

121
00:06:57,977 --> 00:07:01,893
or is it because of the Emperor's throne?

122
00:07:01,893 --> 00:07:07,312
Your Majesty, the way the princes treat you is real.

123
00:07:08,217 --> 00:07:10,725
A man at birth, is fundamentally good in nature.

124
00:07:10,725 --> 00:07:13,776
Moreover, Emperor treats them nicely

125
00:07:13,776 --> 00:07:15,137
and

126
00:07:15,137 --> 00:07:18,156
Emperor makes a pain staking effort to cultivate them.

127
00:07:18,156 --> 00:07:19,781
At times like this,

128
00:07:21,088 --> 00:07:25,000
whether real or pretense, both are good,

129
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,700
I do not care.

130
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:31,955
I only care about their future.

131
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:40,920
They are all my own blood and flesh,

132
00:07:44,835 --> 00:07:47,204
I really hope

133
00:07:49,201 --> 00:07:52,120
the brothers won't destroy each other.

134
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:57,320
I, Long Ke Duo, humbly greets the Emperor.

135
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:00,098
Rise.

136
00:08:00,098 --> 00:08:01,560
Thank you, Your Majesty.

137
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,400
I am getting old.

138
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:12,899
Today, I am also ill.

139
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:16,020
Blessing the Emperor with a long life and good fortune.

140
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:21,312
I plan on having 14th Prince return.

141
00:08:21,312 --> 00:08:23,620
When he returns this time,

142
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:27,800
I don't plan on having him return to the battlefield.

143
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:31,368
Therefore, I need to pick someone to replace him.

144
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:34,851
We must think carefully.

145
00:08:34,851 --> 00:08:37,120
We cannot be too hasty in making this decision.

146
00:08:38,063 --> 00:08:40,430
The Emperor, please look after your health.

147
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:43,062
Bring a cup of tea.

148
00:08:46,277 --> 00:08:49,696
Do you have someone on your mind?

149
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,880
Sister, what's wrong?

150
00:09:34,457 --> 00:09:37,320
Go and bring His Majesty a cup of tea.

151
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:48,505
Emotionally, I hope it will not happen.

152
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:51,960
I do not want 4th Prince to be upset, disappointed, or  in pain.

153
00:09:53,065 --> 00:09:54,387
But rationally,

154
00:09:54,387 --> 00:09:57,520
I think that it is the best solution to everything.

155
00:09:57,862 --> 00:10:00,045
If 14th Prince steps up to the throne,

156
00:10:00,045 --> 00:10:03,110
everyone might still remain alive.

157
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:05,080
If 14th prince becomes Emperor,

158
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:08,544
will he really not kill those brothers who were not on his side?

159
00:10:08,544 --> 00:10:10,448
Hurry, hurry!

160
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:41,060
Has one of the greatest Emperors

161
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:44,743
finally reached the end of his life?

162
00:10:52,036 --> 00:10:53,200
Come.

163
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,448
Yes.

164
00:10:55,448 --> 00:10:56,860
Send this order out.

165
00:10:56,860 --> 00:11:00,269
Immediately send in a large troop to surround Qian'qin Palace.

166
00:11:00,269 --> 00:11:02,112
Without my permission,

167
00:11:02,112 --> 00:11:04,000
no one can enter or leave.

168
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,180
Use my name badge to send out the order.

169
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:08,140
Impose martial law on all 9 Gates.

170
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:10,740
Whether Imperial Prince or Qin'wang,
(Qin'wang -   Prince of the First Rank, highest rank, Bei'le is 4th )

171
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:12,340
without my permission,

172
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:14,120
is forbidden to leave or enter privately.

173
00:11:15,115 --> 00:11:16,400
Yes.

174
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,960
Eunuch Li.

175
00:11:23,614 --> 00:11:27,880
Do you think... my arrangement... is complete?

176
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:31,560
Your arrangement is indeed reasonable and fair.

177
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:35,000
Send people to pass the order on.

178
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,760
No one can leave without permission.

179
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,616
No one can approach without permission.

180
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:43,265
Whoever violates this order will be beaten to death right away!

181
00:11:43,265 --> 00:11:44,426
Understood.

182
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:55,020
I already ordered someone to draft the decree

183
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:58,080
to pass the throne to 14th prince.

184
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:03,761
Later on you will assist him with all your heart.

185
00:12:03,761 --> 00:12:09,160
静 (calm, peace)

186
00:12:17,452 --> 00:12:19,100
Wang'ye we got news from the palace.

187
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,020
The Emperor's illness has become most urgent.

188
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:23,568
Right now the inside and outside of Qian'qin Palace is sealed.  No one can go in or come out.

189
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:25,500
You may leave.

190
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:26,865
Yes.

191
00:12:47,965 --> 00:12:52,537
The win or loss of so many years of hard work will have all been determined by now.

192
00:12:54,264 --> 00:12:55,983
Prepare to enter the palace.

193
00:12:57,655 --> 00:13:02,299
行動 (action)

194
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,569
His Imperial Majesty has passed away

195
00:13:57,569 --> 00:13:58,862
Your Majesty!

196
00:13:59,162 --> 00:14:03,088
Your Majesty!

197
00:14:07,161 --> 00:14:09,009
The Emperor was just telling me

198
00:14:09,009 --> 00:14:11,146
the decree had already been drafted

199
00:14:11,146 --> 00:14:13,050
and the throne is to be passed on to the 4th Prince,

200
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:15,047
when suddenly he fainted!

201
00:14:15,247 --> 00:14:21,316
I didn't imagine it. Your Majesty!

202
00:15:03,332 --> 00:15:07,275
Before the Emperor passed away, he already instructed me (with these words):

203
00:15:07,275 --> 00:15:09,683
"The 4th Prince is noble

204
00:15:09,683 --> 00:15:11,340
and is really similiar to me.

205
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:13,895
He will inherit the throne

206
00:15:13,895 --> 00:15:15,945
Therefore, he will ascend the throne in the next few days

207
00:15:15,945 --> 00:15:18,600
and he will be the new Emperor."

208
00:15:21,829 --> 00:15:25,008
Greetings to Your Majesty!

209
00:15:36,147 --> 00:15:38,012
Greetings to Your Majesty!

210
00:15:38,012 --> 00:15:40,798
Greetings to Your Majesty.

211
00:15:50,791 --> 00:15:53,592
Greetings to Your Majesty.

212
00:16:11,743 --> 00:16:14,397
Restrict everyone separately.

213
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,857
Do not allow anyone to approach privately or spread the news.

214
00:16:17,857 --> 00:16:19,257
Understood.

215
00:16:27,586 --> 00:16:29,304
Maiden.  Please.

216
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:58,515
This way is good too.

217
00:16:59,344 --> 00:17:01,673
I will not witness

218
00:17:01,673 --> 00:17:05,620
the final conflict right before he ascends the throne.

219
00:17:20,583 --> 00:17:23,986
The former Emperor has passed away.  The whole country is in mourning

220
00:17:23,986 --> 00:17:27,520
I beg Your Majesty to take care of yourself

221
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,328
Please, for the sake of the country,

222
00:17:29,328 --> 00:17:31,000
quickly chose an auspicious day to be enthroned,

223
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,322
so the whole country can be notified

224
00:17:32,322 --> 00:17:34,181
to show our Qing Dynasty's prosperity

225
00:17:34,181 --> 00:17:36,131
and show Your Majesty's heavenly grace.

226
00:17:36,248 --> 00:17:38,895
The most important thing right now is the funeral arrangement for the former Emperor.

227
00:17:38,895 --> 00:17:42,099
We can talk about ascending the throne later.

228
00:17:42,921 --> 00:17:45,837
Emperor.  This is of utmost importance.

229
00:17:45,837 --> 00:17:48,624
Even though our Qing Dynasty is at its peak,

230
00:17:48,624 --> 00:17:50,806
the countries surrounding us all have their own ambitions.

231
00:17:50,806 --> 00:17:52,757
They want to invade us at any given opportunity.

232
00:17:52,757 --> 00:17:55,080
Right now, the former Emperor has suddenly died.

233
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:57,401
Our enemies of long standing have been waiting for it.

234
00:17:57,401 --> 00:18:00,884
If Your Majesty does not ascend the throne and spread notification everywhere, there will be no official ruler.

235
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:04,135
That will cause the country not to be at peace.

236
00:18:04,413 --> 00:18:06,560
I agree with that suggestion also.  Your Majesty,

237
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:07,989
the great Qing Dynasty could not be without an Emperor for even one day.

238
00:18:07,989 --> 00:18:10,543
I beg Your Majesty to put aside your grief

239
00:18:10,543 --> 00:18:12,447
and ascend the throne as soon as possible.

240
00:18:12,447 --> 00:18:13,960
I agree also.

241
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:17,480
Right now, the Ministry of (Confucian) Rites has already posted the former Emperor's posthumous decree to the whole country.

242
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:19,437
Everyone under the heavens knows.

243
00:18:19,437 --> 00:18:22,827
I beg Your Majesty to make an immediate decision

244
00:18:22,827 --> 00:18:25,009
to reassure and stabalize the common people's minds.

245
00:18:26,263 --> 00:18:31,000
We beg Your Majesty to chose an auspicious day to ascend the throne.

246
00:19:16,558 --> 00:19:18,276
Fourth Brother.

247
00:19:20,226 --> 00:19:24,127
How dare you! Bei'le, you should call him the Emperor

248
00:19:24,127 --> 00:19:25,980
How could you lack manners in front of the Emperor?

249
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:27,660
You should immediately kneel down and ask for forgiveness.

250
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:29,860
How dare you!  Bei'le'ye

251
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:31,953
is not some servant like you that can be cursed at--

252
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:34,003
Eighth Brother!

253
00:19:37,223 --> 00:19:39,660
I don't know what 4th Brother has discussed here.

254
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:41,775
But why did you not notify all our brothers

255
00:19:41,775 --> 00:19:43,307
and discuss it together?

256
00:19:44,933 --> 00:19:47,726
I am talking about the funeral arrangement for the former Emperor.

257
00:19:49,159 --> 00:19:51,806
Are you also talking about a fake Imperial order to get the throne

258
00:19:51,806 --> 00:19:54,499
and the attempt to be Emperor?

259
00:19:55,149 --> 00:19:59,700
9th Brother.  How could you talk rubbish about the posthumous decree of the former Emperor?

260
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,115
Fourth Brother.

261
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:05,087
You usually focus on farming and the colors of spring,

262
00:20:05,213 --> 00:20:07,177
if the posthumous decree stated that

263
00:20:07,177 --> 00:20:10,242
you were given one hundred acres of good farm land,. I could believe that

264
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,657
But if the decree states the throne is to be passed to you,

265
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,940
then that may be in jest.

266
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:16,558
If you say another absurd word,

267
00:20:16,558 --> 00:20:18,680
do not blame me for not honoring our brotherhood.

268
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,227
What can you do?!

269
00:20:23,733 --> 00:20:25,460
The day that Imperial Father passed away,

270
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:26,840
all of us

271
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,749
were blocked outside of the Emperor's palace.

272
00:20:28,949 --> 00:20:31,520
We could not even get to see our Imperial Father for the last time.

273
00:20:33,207 --> 00:20:36,460
Not sure how on that day you were here

274
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:38,180
or how you persuaded Imperial Father to pass the throne to an

275
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:40,869
unconcerned person who treated farming as a pleasant pastime.

276
00:20:41,566 --> 00:20:45,746
The former Emperor made a determination a long time ago regarding his successor.

277
00:20:45,746 --> 00:20:49,275
He would not be persuaded by others in a few sentences.

278
00:20:49,454 --> 00:20:50,960
While Imperial Father was still alive

279
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,199
he already treated 14th Prince as his favorite.

280
00:20:53,199 --> 00:20:56,078
He entrusted 14th Prince with heavy responsibilities and trusted the 14th Prince.

281
00:20:56,311 --> 00:20:57,890
Everyone in the Imperial Court,

282
00:20:57,890 --> 00:20:59,480
and us brothers alike,

283
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,280
had all took note of that.

284
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:05,060
The intention of Imperial Father was understood without saying.

285
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:06,442
So I ask...

286
00:21:06,442 --> 00:21:08,600
how could Imperial Father during his end time

287
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,440
so suddenly change?

288
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,965
Fourteenth Brother is so extremely talented

289
00:21:13,965 --> 00:21:16,287
he can be called the model among all princes.

290
00:21:16,287 --> 00:21:18,160
I am very happy about that too.

291
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,731
I will entrust him with heavy responsibilities.

292
00:21:20,731 --> 00:21:24,128
I already told our 14th Brother to come back for the funeral.

293
00:21:25,057 --> 00:21:28,000
Therefore, you have no need to use his name when you question me.

294
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,680
Li De Chuan.

295
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,800
Your servant is here

296
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:36,640
Since all the Bei'le and Bei'zi have doubts in their minds
(Princely Ranks)

297
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,120
you should read the posthumous decree aloud again in public.

298
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,560
Yes.

299
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,955
The former Emperor personally said:

300
00:21:45,955 --> 00:21:48,640
"4th Prince is noble

301
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,360
and is really similar to me.

302
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:52,760
He will inherit the throne.

303
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:55,200
Therefore, he will ascend the throne in the next few days

304
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,100
and become the new Emperor."

305
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:59,005
Li De Chuan!

306
00:21:59,005 --> 00:22:00,760
You bastard servant!

307
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,859
Didn't my Imperial Father treat you well when he was alive?

308
00:22:02,859 --> 00:22:05,111
However you dare to fake an Imperial order and help a usurper!

309
00:22:05,111 --> 00:22:06,737
What you did is contrary to Imperial Father's wishes.

310
00:22:06,737 --> 00:22:08,200
That day, several of us were not there.

311
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,877
The posthumous decree in your hand... no one knows whether it is real or a fake!

312
00:22:10,877 --> 00:22:13,040
If you wish for us to willingly kneel down to you and be your servants based on that decree

313
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,971
is impossible!

314
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:22,400
That day both I and Eunuch Li

315
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,127
were both witnesses standing right next to the former Emperor.

316
00:22:25,127 --> 00:22:27,040
I, as a Nine Gate ti'du
(Ti Du - Local Commander)

317
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,480
entrusted by the former Emperor

318
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,400
with guarding the Qian'qin Palace and the former Emperor,

319
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,300
how then could I falsify--

320
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:32,363
Shut up!

321
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:34,600
Imperial Father could have been confused by you.

322
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:37,000
However, do not think that we do not know of your background.

323
00:22:46,327 --> 00:22:48,560
Your servant, Nian Geng Yao, returns to protect the Emperor.

324
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50,785
Greetings to the Emperor.

325
00:22:51,342 --> 00:22:55,360
- Greetings to the Emperor.
- Greetings to the Emperor.

326
00:23:04,345 --> 00:23:05,700
All rise.

327
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:07,800
- Gratitude to His Majesty.
- Gratitude to His Majesty.

328
00:23:14,771 --> 00:23:15,820
While the whole country is in mourning

329
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:17,420
I can understand your feelings.

330
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:18,840
But the most important thing now

331
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:19,980
is the funeral arrangement for the former Emperor

332
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:21,505
and as for the other Imperial matters...

333
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,900
From this day on,

334
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:27,500
General Ma, Long Ke Duo,

335
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:30,282
8th Brother, and also 13th Brother

336
00:23:30,282 --> 00:23:32,751
are the Prime Ministers.

337
00:23:32,851 --> 00:23:34,180
I confer these titles. 8th Prince,

338
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:36,125
the title of He'shuo'lian Qinwang.
(Blood Prince of the First Rank, Lian - his new name )

339
00:23:36,125 --> 00:23:39,460
13th Prince the title of He'shuo'yi Qin'wang.
(Also Blood Prince of the First Rank, Yi - his same name )

340
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:41,880
I hope everyone will cooperate with me

341
00:23:42,658 --> 00:23:44,040
while we go through this difficult time together.

342
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:46,560
- We receive the order and thank Your Majesty.
- We receive the order and thank Your Majesty.

343
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:09,894
I accept the order and thank His Majesty.

344
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:32,380
8th Brother.  How could you just kneel down when you were just given a Qing'wan.

345
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:33,360
Then our brother

346
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,396
couldn't contest again for you!

347
00:24:35,396 --> 00:24:36,840
Contest?

348
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,695
I originally thought that

349
00:24:38,695 --> 00:24:40,421
the attitude of Imperial Father was obvious, that

350
00:24:40,521 --> 00:24:43,040
14th Brother definitely would be the successor

351
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:44,693
and step on the throne as Emperor.

352
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:49,191
Who knew that in just one night, that dream would be in vain.

353
00:24:49,191 --> 00:24:52,720
The Imperial throne is now in 4th Brother's hand with a blink of an eye.

354
00:24:53,138 --> 00:24:54,160
That's right, Eighth Brother.

355
00:24:54,485 --> 00:24:55,480
I really don't understand

356
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:57,520
how you could let it go?

357
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,080
You are really giving the Imperial throne

358
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:01,040
away.

359
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:04,740
We do not have any control over an army in the capital city.

360
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:07,974
It is already difficult enough to deal with Long Ke Duo.

361
00:25:07,974 --> 00:25:10,120
Now that Nian Gen Yao is also here,

362
00:25:10,328 --> 00:25:13,718
which of you can withstand him?

363
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,240
The most important thing is

364
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,560
Long Ke Duo has the oral instruction of Imperial Father

365
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,440
and has Li De Quan as a witness.

366
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:23,935
Now that posthumous decree has been declared all over the country,

367
00:25:24,135 --> 00:25:26,640
unless we have the intention of rebelling,

368
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,997
we do not have the ability to turn it around.

369
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:33,662
You two need not worry.

370
00:25:33,662 --> 00:25:36,636
4th Prince may have controlled the key moment this time,

371
00:25:36,636 --> 00:25:39,040
but it is still not right and proper.

372
00:25:39,439 --> 00:25:42,800
We will have an opportunity in the future to push him off the throne.

373
00:25:43,525 --> 00:25:45,320
The strategy now

374
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:48,269
is restrain action and wait until we have that opportunity.

375
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:52,320
De Fei was always more fond of 14th Brother

376
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,220
and she is the birth mother of 4th Brother too.

377
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:59,400
4th Brother will have a hard time dealing with his own Empress Dowager.

378
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:06,620
Niang Niang, please don't worry anymore. (Queen Mother)

379
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:08,800
Please look after your health.

380
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:19,580
Invite Fourth Prince in.

381
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:21,280
Yes.

382
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:24,020
Greetings to Your Majesty.

383
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:25,200
Excused.

384
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,480
Thank you, Your Majesty.

385
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,540
You may leave.

386
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,080
Mother asked me to come right away,

387
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:39,000
what is it for?

388
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:43,720
4th Prince. Tell me the truth.

389
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:47,880
Did you really fake the posthumous decree?

390
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:50,280
When your Imperial Father was alive,

391
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:52,960
he really liked your 14th Brother.

392
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,600
He would never have

393
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:59,320
passed the throne down to you!

394
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:06,820
I and 14th Prince

395
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:08,720
were both given birth by you.

396
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:13,069
It does not matter which of us ascends to the throne, you will still be titled, Empress Dowager.

397
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:16,700
Mother, why do you favor 14th Brother more?

398
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:20,104
You really believe that I wouldn't be a good Emperor?

399
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:34,560
I am your Imperial Father's concubine.

400
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:38,495
Therefore, I need to follow the former Emperor's posthumous wishes.

401
00:27:38,495 --> 00:27:43,400
Whether your Imperial Father gave the thrown to my own son

402
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,960
or not, I still speak for him.

403
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:51,080
The former Emperor really did speak the order personally.

404
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:55,817
The Imperial Throne belongs to me.  It is right and proper

405
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:01,340
Right and proper?

406
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:04,280
Is it really right and proper?

407
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:07,619
Your heart knows better than anyone else"s.

408
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:13,180
Even though I have not ascended to the throne yet,

409
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:16,320
I am already the real Emperor of the Qing Dynasty!

410
00:28:17,172 --> 00:28:19,800
Today, I would like to tell you,

411
00:28:21,251 --> 00:28:25,520
even though everyone sees you as the Emperor,

412
00:28:26,128 --> 00:28:31,343
I don't consider you deserving of it.

413
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:48,460
I was only detained for seven days,

414
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:50,988
and I can't stand it much longer.

415
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:53,560
For 10 years, 13th Prince hasn't had any freedom,

416
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:56,096
how did he get through it?

417
00:29:59,045 --> 00:30:00,720
4th Prince ascended to the throne.

418
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:03,840
13th Prince will definitely be released

419
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:06,520
and I will finally see him again.

420
00:30:16,321 --> 00:30:20,800
Lady, please follow me back to the palace.

421
00:30:33,085 --> 00:30:35,320
Has the Emperor had his coronation ceremony?

422
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:36,560
Replying to the Lady.

423
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:38,680
Today the Enthronement Ceremony was just finished.

424
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:41,440
His title was also announced to the country

425
00:30:41,816 --> 00:30:43,440
What about the 8th Prince and his people?

426
00:30:43,938 --> 00:30:45,080
Congratulations, Lady.

427
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:48,420
The Emperor has already ordered the 8th Prince to be promoted to Qinwang.

428
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:50,120
Eighth Prince, Thirteenth Prince,

429
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:51,980
General Ma, and General Long,

430
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:53,380
all four of them are now Prime Ministers.

431
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:55,230
The Emperor relies on 8th Prince.

432
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:57,140
Is 13th Prince well?

433
00:30:57,140 --> 00:30:58,481
Very well.

434
00:30:58,481 --> 00:31:00,500
You will be able to see him soon.

435
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:02,475
These last several days, 8th Prince and 13th Prince

436
00:31:02,475 --> 00:31:05,140
have been discussing Imperial matters with the Emperor at Yang'xin Palace every day.

437
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:07,460
The Emperor treats 13th Prince very differently.

438
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:09,880
Because of the taboo, all of the other princes need to avoid using the Emperor's name,

439
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,820
so they all changed their own names,

440
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:14,460
except for the 13th Prince.

441
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:16,801
The Emperor ordered the 13th Prince not to change his name.

442
00:31:16,801 --> 00:31:18,860
However, 13th Prince knelt down and declined.

443
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:22,640
The Emperor really treats 13th Prince generously.

444
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,180
I know.

445
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:25,980
You know?

446
00:31:48,173 --> 00:31:49,774
Only seven days.

447
00:31:49,774 --> 00:31:54,380
Only seven days and the Forbidden City has already changed owners.

448
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:26,508
I was doted on by the former Emperor for many years

449
00:32:26,508 --> 00:32:29,805
but I betrayed him for the 4th Prince.

450
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:33,860
Do I really obsess over the Forbidden City?

451
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:38,180
This may be the 4th Prince's dream

452
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:41,300
but it's my prison.

453
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:05,169
Let's stand up now.

454
00:33:06,641 --> 00:33:11,420
The Emperor asked me to escort you back.

455
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,800
13th Prince...

456
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:27,019
Rouxi has not groomed herself for seven days.

457
00:33:27,019 --> 00:33:29,180
My hair is messy and my face is dirty.

458
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:31,060
I'm unfit to face the Emperor.

459
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:35,400
I would like to groom myself.

460
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:58,440
Lady.  You will live here for now.

461
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:01,520
I will have the servants prepare the bath.

462
00:34:23,304 --> 00:34:24,720
Your servant, Mei Xiang.

463
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:25,979
Your servant,Ju Yun.

464
00:34:25,979 --> 00:34:27,120
- Greetings Lady.
- Greetings Lady.

465
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:29,002
- Greetings Lady Rouxi.
- Greetings Lady Rouxi.

466
00:34:29,002 --> 00:34:30,719
Please rise.

467
00:34:32,067 --> 00:34:33,420
Is Yutan still in the Palace?

468
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:35,220
Your servant doesn't know.

469
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:36,419
What about Wang Xi?

470
00:34:36,419 --> 00:34:37,720
Eunuch Wang is still here.

471
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:41,259
Would you mind finding Eunuch Wang for me?

472
00:34:41,259 --> 00:34:42,539
Yes.

473
00:34:43,031 --> 00:34:45,385
My Lady. Please wash face and rinse mouth first.

474
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:47,197
Alright.

475
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,980
Jie'jie.
(Elder Sister)

476
00:35:02,151 --> 00:35:04,659
Jie'jie what is the matter?

477
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:07,213
Eunuch Wang.

478
00:35:07,213 --> 00:35:09,520
Where are you serving now in the Palace?

479
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:12,507
I'm serving in the Empress' palace.

480
00:35:12,507 --> 00:35:14,260
However, recently there were not enough people,

481
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:17,200
so I am also in service to the Yangxin Palace.

482
00:35:19,009 --> 00:35:20,680
What about Yutan?

483
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:22,840
Yutan, having already attained the age limit, is to be released from the palace.

484
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:24,160
The Emperor has pardoned her

485
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:26,920
to allow her to leave the Palace.

486
00:35:28,436 --> 00:35:30,660
Please tell her to come and see me.

487
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:33,660
This, your servant cannot do.

488
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:35,800
You may leave.

489
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,580
Yes.

490
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:52,220
You two may leave.

491
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:54,220
- Yes.
- Yes.

492
00:36:21,749 --> 00:36:24,500
What am I afraid of?

493
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:27,020
How long can I put this off?

494
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:30,420
When I couldn't see him, I yearned for him.

495
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:35,797
Yet now, when I can see him, I cannot wait to run away.

496
00:37:14,807 --> 00:37:17,380
You're awake, why pretend to be sleeping?

497
00:37:18,708 --> 00:37:20,880
Do you want me to help you light a lamp?

498
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:25,140
I don't want to, this is good.

499
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:39,720
Don't worry.

500
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:41,840
I am really tired.

501
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:45,740
I just want to lay next to you. Is that fine with you?

502
00:38:10,697 --> 00:38:15,220
This moment is what I had hoped for a very long time.

503
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:17,220
Just the two of us.

504
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:19,540
Belonging to each other.

505
00:38:20,057 --> 00:38:24,288
What's in the past remains the past.

506
00:38:24,288 --> 00:38:26,020
Ruo'xi!

507
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:28,460
I am here.

508
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:33,400
I just had a dream that I was hugging you.

509
00:38:35,814 --> 00:38:37,740
Right now is good.

510
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:41,700
You and 13th Prince have both returned to my side.

511
00:38:43,291 --> 00:38:45,980
We are all by your side.

512
00:38:56,740 --> 00:38:59,180
I think I better not sleep.

513
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:01,620
There are still many things to see.

514
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:19,060
I want to see Yutan.

515
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:21,720
In the Palace, all these years,

516
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:23,979
we always had only each other for company.

517
00:39:23,979 --> 00:39:26,140
We're like real sisters.

518
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:28,780
Even after I was sent to the washing department,

519
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:31,220
she was the one who continued to care for me.

520
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:36,180
I promise you.

521
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:41,860
I also want to see Jie'jie.

522
00:39:49,846 --> 00:39:52,060
Right now is not the time.

523
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:55,326
Things in the Palace still need reorganizing.

524
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:58,500
When everything is settled,

525
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:01,820
I will let her come and see you.

526
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:03,860
All right?

527
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:05,500
Thank you.

528
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:12,140
I want you to smile like this every day.

529
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:17,140
You should go.

530
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:26,260
Didn't you say that you still have things to do?

531
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:35,620
You really know how to torture people.

532
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:46,000
Gao Wu Yong!

533
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Your servant is here.

534
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,160
Send for some food.

535
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,660
Send for some light dishes and porridge.

536
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:51,147
I obey.

537
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:16,000
All right. That should be fine.

538
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,639
It is still warm.  Let it be covered a little longer

539
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:23,098
Lady.  Sister Yutan has come.

540
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:25,340
Come in.

541
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:28,560
Jie'jie.

542
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:29,980
Why have you only come now?

543
00:41:30,389 --> 00:41:31,800
You may leave.

544
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,060
Yes.

545
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:37,980
Yutan, how are you?

546
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,360
Come here and sit down.

547
00:41:46,614 --> 00:41:49,343
What difficulties do you have, tell me.

548
00:41:49,343 --> 00:41:52,600
Jie'jie, Yutan doesn't want to leave the Palace.

549
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:54,980
Please, I will have the Emperor reward you well.

550
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:57,900
After leaving the Palace, you will definitely not suffer.

551
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:02,000
All these years, the rewards given me, although cannot be compared to yours,

552
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,197
but it is still enough to last until I am old.

553
00:42:06,147 --> 00:42:07,740
Do you have someone in mind?

554
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:11,020
I will beg the Emperor to arrange a good marriage for you.

555
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:14,360
If the emperor personally confers the marriage, even if you cannot be the first wife,

556
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:16,543
nobody will dare to look down on you.

557
00:42:16,543 --> 00:42:18,260
Yutan doesn't want to marry anyone.

558
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:20,940
Ever since I entered the palace, I long got rid of that idea.

559
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:21,980
Now,

560
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:24,140
I just wish that my family will always be safe.

561
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:26,580
My younger brothers to have a successful official career.

562
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:29,100
This is was why I entered the Palace.

563
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:31,820
Now,

564
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:34,592
I just want only to keep Jie'jie company.

565
00:42:34,592 --> 00:42:37,810
People who want to go, can't.

566
00:42:37,810 --> 00:42:41,500
People who can go, don't want to leave.

567
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:43,020
My very good sister,

568
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:46,220
please allow me to stay!

569
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:50,900
In my heart,

570
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:53,700
I also wish you could accompany me.

571
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:59,340
In this Palace, who else do I have to talk to about private matters.

572
00:43:03,385 --> 00:43:05,820
But there are some things that even I can't do.

573
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:07,700
I can only go and beg the Emperor.

574
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:09,600
Then, is Jie'jie promising me?

575
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:12,260
The Emperor will definitely not refuse your request.

576
00:43:12,620 --> 00:43:14,940
I, myself, have no guarantee in this matter.

577
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:17,549
But yet you are so full of confidence.

578
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:23,400
Where are you staying now?

579
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:25,280
I'm still in the same old courtyard.

580
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:26,780
Eunuch Li is well?

581
00:43:26,780 --> 00:43:27,940
I haven't seen him.

582
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:30,840
I heard he left the Palace to enjoy his retirement.

583
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:45,080
It is getting late,

584
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:46,820
Jie'jie needs to rest.

585
00:43:46,820 --> 00:43:49,639
There will be more days to talk.

586
00:43:49,639 --> 00:43:51,729
I'll see you out.

587
00:43:52,340 --> 00:43:53,440
Meixiang, Juyu?

588
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:54,420
- Here.
- Here.

589
00:43:55,676 --> 00:43:57,260
Help me see Yutan out.

590
00:43:57,260 --> 00:43:58,740
- Yes.
- Yes.

591
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:10,374
Shall I help Lady retire for the night?

592
00:44:21,645 --> 00:44:23,640
Has the Emperor gone to rest already?

593
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:25,220
I don't think so.

594
00:44:25,220 --> 00:44:28,020
It has been said, that for this period the Emperor has been attending to official matters.

595
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:30,622
Always going to bed very late.

596
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:41,582
Today, I have been sent a few good horses from Xi'bei.

597
00:44:42,139 --> 00:44:43,180
So I

598
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:46,580
want to give Yi'qinwang a grand gift.

599
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:50,680
On that day,

600
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:53,000
if Imperial Brother wants to gift a good horse,

601
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,040
why not...

602
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:55,860
but I have my own plans in mind.

603
00:44:56,220 --> 00:44:57,320
First come and view

604
00:44:57,320 --> 00:44:59,420
the grand gift I have prepared for you.

605
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:14,660
E'ling'e?

606
00:45:15,794 --> 00:45:17,387
E'ling'e.

607
00:45:17,387 --> 00:45:19,700
That year when false charges were set up against me,

608
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:23,580
he caused Yi'qinwang to be exiled for ten years.

609
00:45:23,580 --> 00:45:26,675
Also, he wanted to sow discord between Imperial Father and I.

610
00:45:26,675 --> 00:45:28,340
Lian'qinwang,

611
00:45:28,340 --> 00:45:30,660
you and E'ling'e are old acquaintances.

612
00:45:30,660 --> 00:45:32,820
If what I have just said is not the truth,

613
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:35,340
you can investigate the case thoroughly.

614
00:45:37,460 --> 00:45:40,802
I have no objections.

615
00:45:40,802 --> 00:45:41,660
Good.

616
00:45:41,660 --> 00:45:46,480
Your Majesty, please spare me!

617
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:50,700
Please spare me, Your Majesty!

618
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:55,920
I recently stepped upon the throne,

619
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:58,380
there are many things that need to be dealt with.

620
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:00,460
It is the time when I need people the most.

621
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:04,020
8th Prince and 13th Prince.  Thank you for your trouble.

622
00:46:04,020 --> 00:46:05,620
What the Emperor says is too generous.

623
00:46:05,620 --> 00:46:08,460
I will do the work with all my effort.

624
00:46:09,020 --> 00:46:11,740
If Imperial Brother does not consider me slow and stupid,

625
00:46:11,740 --> 00:46:15,840
I will do the work with all my effort.

626
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:18,540
Recently, I checked every Bureau's account books.

627
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:20,740
These account books were all inaccurate and confusing.

628
00:46:20,740 --> 00:46:22,620
Right now, the start treasury is empty.

629
00:46:22,620 --> 00:46:24,420
What good plan does 8th Prince have?

630
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:27,580
The plan should be different for the different Bureaus.

631
00:46:27,580 --> 00:46:30,200
Also, the account books are very important matters.

632
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:33,020
It is beyond my ability.

633
00:46:33,020 --> 00:46:34,120
Please give me those

634
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:36,740
chaotic and unimportant matters from the local offices.

635
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:39,620
It is more appropriate.

636
00:46:39,620 --> 00:46:42,700
Everything in the Imperial Court is important.  There are no chaotic and unimportant matters.

637
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:44,700
How about this?

638
00:46:45,380 --> 00:46:48,293
13th Brother and I have not dealt with Imperial matters for many years.

639
00:46:48,293 --> 00:46:51,400
Right now is the time for us to become familiar with them and we should start with detailed matters.

640
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:54,840
13th Prince and I will start by examining those account books.

641
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:56,280
If we find something that is not right,

642
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:59,460
then we will call 8th Prince to discuss them.

643
00:47:00,580 --> 00:47:02,580
- Yes, Your Majesty.  We will follow the order.
- Yes, Your Majesty.  We will follow the order.

644
00:47:08,630 --> 00:47:13,180
♫ Stopping here, afraid to go any further,  ♫

645
00:47:14,660 --> 00:47:19,220
♫ so sorrow will be unable to make an appearance  ♫

646
00:47:21,350 --> 00:47:26,780
♫  On the next page, the farewell penned by you,  ♫

647
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:31,970
♫  it was not up to me to refuse  ♫

648
00:47:34,010 --> 00:47:39,380
♫  We’ve walked down this path too hastily  ♫

649
00:47:40,590 --> 00:47:46,180
♫  Embracing desires that weren’t realistic  ♫

650
00:47:47,070 --> 00:47:52,880
♫  Not in time, wasn’t able to wait long enough to look back and admire  ♫

651
00:47:53,590 --> 00:47:58,110
♫  The fragrance of magnolia is unable to hide wounds  ♫

652
00:47:58,810 --> 00:48:04,680
♫  No longer looking for the sun’s rays peeking through the clouds  ♫

653
00:48:05,310 --> 00:48:11,440
♫  No longer looking for the paradise that we promised each other

654
00:48:11,890 --> 00:48:18,020
♫  No longer sighing, you once said that life is unpredictable  ♫

655
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:25,940
♫  The three inches of sunlight that I was unable to borrow  ♫

656
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:34,240
♫  No longer looking for the sunlight peeking through the clouds  ♫

657
00:48:34,690 --> 00:48:40,560
♫  No longer looking for the paradise that we promised each other  ♫

658
00:48:41,050 --> 00:48:47,210
♫  No longer sighing, you once said that life is unpredictable  ♫

659
00:48:47,550 --> 00:48:53,240
♫  The three inches of sunlight that I was unable to borrow  ♫

660
00:48:53,830 --> 00:49:01,940
♫  That paradise is the place where I’d loved you  ♫
