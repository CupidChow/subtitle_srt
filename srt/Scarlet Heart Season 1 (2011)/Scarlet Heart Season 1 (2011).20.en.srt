♫  We were destined to seek our doom like moths flying towards the flame  ♫

Scarlet Heart
- Episode 20 -

24
00:02:14,939 --> 00:02:15,980
Ruoxi,

25
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:17,260
I don't care

26
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:18,700
what happened between

27
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:19,860
you and 8th Brother in the past.

28
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:23,060
Since you have a promise with 4th Brother now,

29
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,900
you have to treat him well.

30
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:29,300
How did you know?

31
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:31,340
Does the 4th Prince know?

32
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:32,800
4th Brother doesn't know.

33
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,120
First of all, you hid it well.

34
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:37,780
Secondly, everyone thinks that there is something going on between you and 14th Brother.

35
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:41,100
I'm only telling you because I'm a little inebriated.

36
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:44,420
Who knew, I would be actually right.

37
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:47,360
You cannot let the 4th Prince know.

38
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,760
I promise you.

39
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:55,580
But aren't you

40
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:57,620
thinking of 4th Brother a little too petty?

41
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:00,360
If Zuo Ying can be tolerant toward Min Min,

42
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:03,460
why can't 4th Brother be tolerant toward you?

43
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,720
I've never felt

44
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,400
that a woman before marriage,

45
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,080
could not like someone else.

46
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,200
Of course, I wouldn't mind him knowing.

47
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:16,180
If it was 10th Prince or 14th Prince

48
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:17,780
or any other person,

49
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,660
I would have told him long ago.

50
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:22,700
But I couldn't since it was 8th Prince.

51
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:25,020
What do you mean?

52
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:29,060
I cannot tell you.

53
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:31,220
But it's true,

54
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:35,020
for 8th Prince's sake, I can't tell him.

55
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:37,940
Whether it's now or later

56
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:39,660
and even if he doesn't mind it.

57
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,740
But I cannot take that risk.

58
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,940
It's a risk

59
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,800
I cannot afford.

60
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:56,100
Though I don't understand it or why,

61
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:57,860
I trust you.

62
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:00,900
You must have your own reasons.

63
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:04,280
How fortunate I am

64
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,420
to have you as a friend.

65
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,860
Actually,

66
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:18,700
4th Brother hides his thoughts very deeply.

67
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:20,540
And it's extremely hard for him to get close to anyone.

68
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:23,139
Such people easily suffer alone.

69
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:25,740
Although, I can help to share some of his worries,

70
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:29,260
he is still lonesome after all.

71
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:32,460
But you are different from everybody else.

72
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:35,020
Although, you aren't highly educated,

73
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:36,300
I've always felt

74
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:38,660
you're not any less well-read than us.

75
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:41,480
You've even studied things that we haven't.

76
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:44,580
Ruoxi, as long as you are willing,

77
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:47,260
you really can open 4th Brother's heart.

78
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:48,900
And only you can

79
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:52,060
because you can understand his ambition

80
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:53,680
and also understand his pain.

81
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:56,974
There are a few other things

82
00:04:57,267 --> 00:04:59,614
I might as well simply tell you today.

83
00:04:59,614 --> 00:05:01,628
Otherwise, I don't know when

84
00:05:01,628 --> 00:05:03,900
I will get a chance to in future.

85
00:05:04,349 --> 00:05:05,674
You have to remember this well,

86
00:05:07,089 --> 00:05:08,503
now that you're in the palace,

87
00:05:08,503 --> 00:05:10,129
all that you have

88
00:05:10,129 --> 00:05:12,700
comes from receiving Imperial Father's favors.

89
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,271
Imperial Father trusts you

90
00:05:14,271 --> 00:05:16,240
because you don't have any hidden agendas.

91
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,723
You don't take anyone's side

92
00:05:17,723 --> 00:05:19,534
or suppress anyone.

93
00:05:19,534 --> 00:05:22,035
You just wholeheartedly serve Imperial Father.

94
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:23,620
But,

95
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:26,506
if you get involved

96
00:05:26,506 --> 00:05:28,126
in our brothers' feud,

97
00:05:28,126 --> 00:05:30,030
you will lose everything you have.

98
00:05:30,726 --> 00:05:34,200
Ruoxi, in this deep palace,

99
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:37,167
the ending result will be too dreadful to ponder.

100
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:40,711
This has always been a fight amongst us men.

101
00:05:40,711 --> 00:05:42,011
We do this

102
00:05:42,011 --> 00:05:44,040
to obtain more wishes,

103
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,500
secret desires,

104
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,584
and even more rank and honor.

105
00:05:47,584 --> 00:05:50,171
To be able to sit in the highest position,

106
00:05:50,951 --> 00:05:52,569
regardless of the results,

107
00:05:52,569 --> 00:05:53,420
this is all that we

108
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:55,438
knowingly accept.

109
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:56,767
But you? Why do you

110
00:05:56,767 --> 00:05:59,428
make sacrifices for our personal battles?

111
00:06:00,587 --> 00:06:03,745
They should not be your sacrifices.

112
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:07,168
Why suddenly tell me all this?

113
00:06:07,437 --> 00:06:09,680
Because 8th Brother is your brother-in-law.

114
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,660
Let alone, you and him...

115
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:15,857
as well as 10th Brother and 14th Brother

116
00:06:15,857 --> 00:06:17,972
are people whom you cannot part with.

117
00:06:17,972 --> 00:06:20,180
But since you promised 4th Brother that

118
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:21,857
you will be 4th Brother's woman,

119
00:06:21,857 --> 00:06:23,225
I'm afraid that in a moment of haste

120
00:06:23,225 --> 00:06:24,860
you will get involved in our struggles.

121
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:26,420
I know

122
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:27,994
watching everything that's happening

123
00:06:27,994 --> 00:06:29,566
will make you suffer.

124
00:06:29,566 --> 00:06:31,089
But if you get involved,

125
00:06:31,089 --> 00:06:33,142
you will suffer even more.

126
00:06:39,434 --> 00:06:41,385
This is the royal family,

127
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:44,140
where it's impossible to avoid feuding and suffering.

128
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:46,424
No one can stop it.

129
00:06:46,424 --> 00:06:48,467
Even wise and farsighted Imperial Father

130
00:06:48,467 --> 00:06:49,420
can only helplessly

131
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:51,478
watch events unfold.

132
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:53,390
Not to mention you.

133
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:58,577
Ruoxi,

134
00:06:59,775 --> 00:07:02,469
I just want you to follow 4th Brother safely

135
00:07:02,469 --> 00:07:04,108
and treat him well.

136
00:07:04,108 --> 00:07:06,773
Everything else is secondary.

137
00:07:07,438 --> 00:07:09,142
Whoever wins and whoever loses,

138
00:07:09,992 --> 00:07:12,467
is between the rest of us.

139
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:23,908
Didn't we agree

140
00:07:23,924 --> 00:07:25,683
to get drunk tonight?

141
00:07:28,707 --> 00:07:32,471
Let's not talk about this boring subject. Come.

142
00:07:56,223 --> 00:07:58,252
Jie'jie, you're awake.

143
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:00,540
Yu Tan,

144
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:02,051
when you came back last night

145
00:08:02,051 --> 00:08:03,637
was I already asleep?

146
00:08:03,637 --> 00:08:05,202
You were sleeping soundly.

147
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:09,680
Jie`jie, it's getting late

148
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,453
do you want me to take over your shift?

149
00:08:11,453 --> 00:08:13,197
No need. I'll go right away.

150
00:08:13,691 --> 00:08:15,038
Slow down!

151
00:08:20,139 --> 00:08:21,532
Ruoxi Jie`jie.

152
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:22,693
Ruoxi Jie`jie.

153
00:08:22,693 --> 00:08:23,978
His Majesty is holding court

154
00:08:23,978 --> 00:08:24,906
and His face doesn't look too good...

155
00:08:24,906 --> 00:08:26,385
Jie'jie, you need to be careful.

156
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,561
Alright.

157
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:52,174
I have already ordered,

158
00:08:52,174 --> 00:08:53,242
that if among any of you princes

159
00:08:53,242 --> 00:08:55,682
anyone schemes against the Crown Prince,

160
00:08:55,682 --> 00:08:58,884
he is a traitor to the country and has committed a crime!

161
00:08:58,884 --> 00:09:01,471
Did you order someone, through various means of communication,

162
00:09:01,471 --> 00:09:03,600
to spread rumors and slander

163
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,895
loudly about the Crown Prince's actions

164
00:09:06,895 --> 00:09:09,900
to the Manchurian officials in the capital city

165
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,671
and the citizens of Jiangnan province?

166
00:09:11,671 --> 00:09:14,172
Thus, making it seem as if the Crown Prince's public image

167
00:09:14,172 --> 00:09:17,005
might raise questions about his succession to the throne and

168
00:09:17,005 --> 00:09:19,838
that at anytime he might lose his position.

169
00:09:19,838 --> 00:09:22,600
How conniving and devious, Yong Qinwang!
(Yong - his name, Qinwang - princely rank )

170
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,171
Respectfully, Imperial Father,

171
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:27,175
this was not my doing.

172
00:09:27,175 --> 00:09:29,172
- Your subject is guilty.
- Your subject is guilty.

173
00:09:29,172 --> 00:09:32,144
This matter definitely has nothing to do with 4th Prince

174
00:09:32,144 --> 00:09:35,302
It is all our doing.

175
00:09:35,302 --> 00:09:39,017
You two are loyal for sure,

176
00:09:39,017 --> 00:09:41,943
but do you still see me as your king?

177
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:47,609
For the past two to three years,

178
00:09:47,609 --> 00:09:51,417
you both have been secretly dealing with 4th Prince.

179
00:09:51,417 --> 00:09:54,203
Where and with what people,

180
00:09:54,203 --> 00:09:56,154
all that evidence has been recorded.

181
00:09:56,154 --> 00:09:57,872
If they weren't doing all this for you,

182
00:09:57,872 --> 00:10:01,587
don't tell me, it was they themselves that coveted the Crown Prince's status.

183
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:06,856
Even though I have conversed with them before,

184
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:09,746
I have never instructed them to do any such thing.

185
00:10:10,016 --> 00:10:11,767
I hope it's not 4th Brother,

186
00:10:11,767 --> 00:10:13,935
otherwise, you two will only suffer along with him

187
00:10:15,124 --> 00:10:16,703
and all my efforts

188
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:19,351
in helping you out, would be in vain.

189
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:21,998
He was the one who set up 4th Prince,

190
00:10:21,998 --> 00:10:23,530
killing two birds with one stone,

191
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:26,220
by striking a blow at the Crown Prince and also getting rid of 4th Prince.

192
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:27,779
E'ling'e and Kui'xu

193
00:10:27,779 --> 00:10:29,544
were the ones who spread rumors everywhere.

194
00:10:29,544 --> 00:10:31,541
On the surface, they appear to be shielding 4th Prince,

195
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:34,095
but in actual fact, they were carrying out 8th Prince's orders

196
00:10:34,095 --> 00:10:35,540
to frame 4th Prince.

197
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:38,043
He really thought through this plan very carefully and methodically.

198
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:41,270
I only know that the Crown prince will be stripped of his title this year.

199
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:44,010
But what about 4th Prince?

200
00:10:47,841 --> 00:10:49,513
13th Prince...

201
00:10:50,767 --> 00:10:52,485
13th Brother...

202
00:10:55,411 --> 00:10:57,088
Since things have come to this stage

203
00:10:57,088 --> 00:10:59,514
Imperial Father will find out the truth sooner or later,

204
00:10:59,514 --> 00:11:01,379
so I will make my confession now.

205
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:05,581
This matter was my doing. I secretly incited E'ling'e and Kui'xu.

206
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:06,728
Under the pretext of using 4th Brother's name

207
00:11:06,728 --> 00:11:08,854
I ordered them to spread rumors everywhere.

208
00:11:08,854 --> 00:11:11,015
Since everything has been exposed today,

209
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:13,894
then no one should think of shedding responsibility.

210
00:11:13,894 --> 00:11:15,148
13th Brother,

211
00:11:15,148 --> 00:11:17,122
your words are really strange.

212
00:11:17,122 --> 00:11:18,536
Everyone knows that you and 4th Brother

213
00:11:18,536 --> 00:11:20,180
are inseparable companions.

214
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:23,291
Your intentions are as good as saying they're 4th Brother's intentions?

215
00:11:23,291 --> 00:11:25,451
Imperial Father, just ask E'ling'e and Kui'xu

216
00:11:25,451 --> 00:11:26,821
whether I'm the one who instructed them in this matter.

217
00:11:26,821 --> 00:11:28,453
You'll have the answer immediately.

218
00:11:30,004 --> 00:11:32,540
What is the truth of this matter?

219
00:11:32,829 --> 00:11:35,287
The...

220
00:11:35,287 --> 00:11:36,912
Imperial Father.

221
00:11:38,602 --> 00:11:39,810
In my opinion,

222
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:41,806
this matter is not something 4th Brother would do.

223
00:11:41,806 --> 00:11:43,485
4th Brother is like a hermit.

224
00:11:43,485 --> 00:11:45,197
He often meditates and recites scriptures in his residence.

225
00:11:45,197 --> 00:11:46,636
He is usually is the most filial.

226
00:11:46,636 --> 00:11:48,401
He is always considerate of Imperial Father's regard.

227
00:11:48,401 --> 00:11:50,723
He definitely wouldn't do something so immoral.

228
00:11:50,723 --> 00:11:53,106
I deserve death.

229
00:11:53,106 --> 00:11:54,763
What 13th Prince has said is the truth.

230
00:11:54,763 --> 00:11:56,621
Y-Yes, it was 13th Prince.

231
00:11:56,621 --> 00:11:57,410
This year

232
00:11:57,410 --> 00:11:59,073
on the eighth day of the third month,

233
00:11:59,073 --> 00:12:01,216
there was a secret meeting at Qu'hua'lou,

234
00:12:01,216 --> 00:12:03,738
where he gave us the instructions.

235
00:12:03,738 --> 00:12:05,769
We were to spread rumors about all of the Crown Prince's transgressions

236
00:12:05,769 --> 00:12:07,441
Those were his orders.

237
00:12:07,441 --> 00:12:09,313
I wouldn't dare to deceive your Imperial Majesty.

238
00:12:09,313 --> 00:12:10,321
That's right, that's right.

239
00:12:10,321 --> 00:12:12,014
4th Prince,

240
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:15,845
is all this really the 13th Prince's doing?

241
00:12:21,622 --> 00:12:24,090
This question is a trap.

242
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:28,384
To answer yes or no wouldn't be right.

243
00:12:29,934 --> 00:12:32,935
This matter was not my doing.

244
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:37,572
I also have no idea,

245
00:12:37,572 --> 00:12:40,412
if it was 13th brother's doing.

246
00:12:47,303 --> 00:12:49,275
3rd Prince.

247
00:12:49,275 --> 00:12:50,336
Yes, Imperial Father.

248
00:12:50,336 --> 00:12:51,629
13th Prince is to be

249
00:12:51,629 --> 00:12:53,951
placed under house arrest at Yang'feng'jia'dao.

250
00:12:53,951 --> 00:12:55,251
Without my permission,

251
00:12:55,251 --> 00:12:57,991
no one is allowed to visit him.

252
00:12:57,991 --> 00:13:00,267
With regards to E'ling'e and Kui'xu,

253
00:13:00,267 --> 00:13:04,168
they will be handed over to the Ministry of Justice for investigation and punishment.

254
00:13:04,168 --> 00:13:05,582
Yes.

255
00:13:28,363 --> 00:13:33,585
I obey your decree and offer my gratitude.

256
00:13:40,809 --> 00:13:46,496
13th prince, from today onward, we will be separated.

257
00:13:57,845 --> 00:13:58,967
Court is dismissed.

258
00:13:58,967 --> 00:14:02,843
Court is dismissed.

259
00:15:40,338 --> 00:15:42,781
Go back.

260
00:15:52,505 --> 00:15:59,314
For the sake of 13th Prince, please go back.

261
00:17:00,911 --> 00:17:05,537
4th Prince has not entered the palace for many days.

262
00:17:14,006 --> 00:17:15,066
Greetings to Li Gong Gong.

263
00:17:15,066 --> 00:17:16,799
No need.

264
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:17,877
13th Prince has been

265
00:17:17,877 --> 00:17:20,559
exiled for seven days already.

266
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:23,360
4th Prince is quietly reflecting at home

267
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:26,109
and avoiding all politics.

268
00:17:26,109 --> 00:17:28,300
I'm afraid that during this time,

269
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:30,547
he won't be entering the palace.

270
00:17:30,547 --> 00:17:31,920
Because of this matter, the Emperor

271
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:34,516
is extremely sad.

272
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:37,780
As the person serving at the Emperor's side,

273
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:39,712
you should be aware of the appropriate behavior.

274
00:17:39,712 --> 00:17:42,219
Things that should not be said, should not be spoken.

275
00:17:42,219 --> 00:17:44,584
Unwelcomed sympathy,

276
00:17:44,584 --> 00:17:46,140
should just be felt in your heart.

277
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:49,007
By all means, avoid trouble.

278
00:17:49,007 --> 00:17:50,880
Much thanks, Li'gong'gong for your reminders.

279
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,450
You're are an intelligent person.

280
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:56,500
I don't need to say too much.

281
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,400
Li'gong'gong.

282
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,806
Jie'jie.

283
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:05,220
What's wrong?

284
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:11,344
Nothing much, just feeling a little dizzy.

285
00:18:11,344 --> 00:18:13,160
Are you falling sick?

286
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:16,020
Why don't you go back and rest for awhile?

287
00:18:16,885 --> 00:18:19,280
Please handle my duties, then.

288
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,224
Little brother,

289
00:18:44,224 --> 00:18:46,340
I beg of you, please help me pass a message to 4th Prince.

290
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:48,062
Lu'wu has an important matter to discuss with him.

291
00:18:48,062 --> 00:18:49,080
4th Prince has stated that he won't be entertaining visitors.

292
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,380
He won't meet with anyone.

293
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:53,700
If 4th Prince refuses to see me today,

294
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,720
I will continue to kneel down here.

295
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,799
If after a long while, 4th Prince still refuses to see me,

296
00:18:57,799 --> 00:19:00,900
I will be kneeling here for a very long time.

297
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,340
Suit yourself.

298
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:27,660
Wang'ye.

299
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:35,013
I understand what Wang'ye is going through now.

300
00:19:35,013 --> 00:19:36,460
13th Brother has accompanied you

301
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:37,700
for so many years.

302
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:39,480
Today, he took the blame from you.

303
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,760
He must know

304
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:43,860
you're suffering and how helpless you are.

305
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,280
13th Brother knows me and trusts me.

306
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:51,620
And yet he has fallen into this state.

307
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:02,400
Wang'ye, I believe

308
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,320
you definitely won't let 13th Brother continue suffering.

309
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:08,380
You'll definitely be able to save 13th Brother.

310
00:20:15,709 --> 00:20:18,452
Wang ye.

311
00:20:18,452 --> 00:20:19,717
Wang'ye.

312
00:20:19,717 --> 00:20:23,000
Why are you so flustered? Have you forgotten our house rules?

313
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,766
I know my mistake now, please forgive me.

314
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:27,813
Forget it. Stand up and speak.

315
00:20:29,037 --> 00:20:30,420
There's a woman outside...

316
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:32,981
asking to see you. She said she's Lu'wu.

317
00:20:32,981 --> 00:20:36,080
I told her that you won't see anyone...

318
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:40,397
but she said she will kneel outside until you see her.

319
00:20:40,397 --> 00:20:42,620
She's really a love-sick fool.

320
00:20:43,551 --> 00:20:44,555
But for now,

321
00:20:44,555 --> 00:20:46,273
even if I could think of some ideas

322
00:20:46,273 --> 00:20:48,681
I wouldn't be able to do anything.

323
00:20:49,881 --> 00:20:51,607
Give her my reply.

324
00:20:51,607 --> 00:20:53,279
Tell her

325
00:20:53,279 --> 00:20:54,604
kneeling down outside my residence

326
00:20:54,604 --> 00:20:56,529
will only be wasting her time,

327
00:20:56,529 --> 00:20:57,862
so let her leave early.

328
00:20:57,862 --> 00:20:59,130
Yes.

329
00:21:15,123 --> 00:21:16,518
Hurry up and leave. Wang'ye said

330
00:21:16,518 --> 00:21:18,404
you are only wasting your time.

331
00:21:18,404 --> 00:21:19,472
It's of no use.

332
00:21:19,472 --> 00:21:20,920
Hurry and leave.

333
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:23,791
Leave. Hurry and leave.

334
00:21:23,791 --> 00:21:26,692
4th Prince really said that?

335
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:03,054
13th Prince.

336
00:22:03,398 --> 00:22:05,140
From today on,

337
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:07,538
who will drink wine with you?

338
00:22:07,538 --> 00:22:09,535
Listen to you playing the flute

339
00:22:09,535 --> 00:22:12,342
and have heart-to-heart talks on all matters?

340
00:22:20,998 --> 00:22:22,327
Ruoxi.

341
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,801
Since you're here, why didn't you answer me?

342
00:22:35,959 --> 00:22:37,327
So you really are planning

343
00:22:37,327 --> 00:22:39,278
that from now on, besides a greeting,

344
00:22:39,278 --> 00:22:41,553
you aren't going to talk to us.

345
00:22:43,622 --> 00:22:46,126
Can I drink some wine?

346
00:22:46,126 --> 00:22:47,653
You are a prince.

347
00:22:47,653 --> 00:22:50,539
If you want to drink, who can stop you?

348
00:23:02,181 --> 00:23:03,535
Ruoxi.

349
00:23:03,535 --> 00:23:05,997
I know you and 13th Prince are good friends.

350
00:23:05,997 --> 00:23:06,886
But we are also

351
00:23:06,886 --> 00:23:08,769
friends since we were young.

352
00:23:08,769 --> 00:23:10,719
How can you favor one and discriminate against the others?

353
00:23:11,135 --> 00:23:12,338
And also

354
00:23:12,338 --> 00:23:14,581
many things depend on one's standpoint,

355
00:23:14,581 --> 00:23:16,553
there's no right or wrong.

356
00:23:19,968 --> 00:23:22,158
Are you here to rebuke me today?

357
00:23:22,158 --> 00:23:24,640
I don't have the mood to listen.

358
00:23:33,189 --> 00:23:36,097
This is Lu'wu's letter for you.

359
00:23:40,069 --> 00:23:41,741
To see me, Lu'wu,

360
00:23:41,741 --> 00:23:42,900
in front of my door,

361
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:44,310
knelt for one day and one night,

362
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:46,401
before she begged a servant to help her pass on a message.

363
00:23:46,401 --> 00:23:47,544
I heard that Lu'wu,

364
00:23:47,544 --> 00:23:49,873
also knelt in front of 4th Prince's door,

365
00:23:49,873 --> 00:23:51,842
but no one bothered about her.

366
00:23:51,842 --> 00:23:54,657
Because of a lack of a better option, she came to find me.

367
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:01,283
Lu'wu wants to take care of 13th Prince.

368
00:24:01,283 --> 00:24:03,812
Do you think it's possible?

369
00:24:03,812 --> 00:24:04,968
If you are going to reply,

370
00:24:04,968 --> 00:24:06,160
then hurry up and write it.

371
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:08,185
I will take the letter to her when I go out.

372
00:24:08,185 --> 00:24:10,996
So as to cure her of her sentimentalism as soon as possible.

373
00:24:11,772 --> 00:24:14,187
How do you know the contents of the letter?

374
00:24:14,187 --> 00:24:16,130
Lu'wu begged me as well,

375
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:17,802
but the Emperor has already said

376
00:24:17,802 --> 00:24:18,923
that without an Imperial Edict

377
00:24:18,923 --> 00:24:21,617
nobody can visit him.

378
00:24:21,617 --> 00:24:22,560
Originally, I didn't want to

379
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:23,846
help her deliver this letter,

380
00:24:23,846 --> 00:24:26,580
but I felt pity for her painstaking effort.

381
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:28,722
I thought of the friendship between you and 13th Brother.

382
00:24:28,722 --> 00:24:29,780
Maybe, your words

383
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:31,493
can persuade her.

384
00:24:31,493 --> 00:24:33,868
Please do your best to advise her.

385
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:37,026
Lu'wu is looking extremely haggard these days.

386
00:24:37,026 --> 00:24:38,798
Even if I had a heart of stone,

387
00:24:38,798 --> 00:24:41,860
I also cannot bear to see her like this.

388
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:43,580
So you really don't have any ideas?

389
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:46,416
Ruoxi, if I could fulfill her wish,

390
00:24:46,416 --> 00:24:48,673
I would happily help her.

391
00:24:48,673 --> 00:24:49,958
Don't tell me that in your heart,

392
00:24:49,958 --> 00:24:51,940
I'm that cold-blooded.

393
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:53,200
Nothing can be done, because Imperial Father

394
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,800
has already made a decree.

395
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:56,820
Nowadays,

396
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:58,962
if I have anything to do with 13th Brother

397
00:24:58,962 --> 00:24:59,820
Imperial Father will have suspicions about me

398
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:01,580
being connected to the "spreading of rumors" matter.

399
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:04,300
That the matter was not the will of 13th Brother alone,

400
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:05,420
even has 4th Brother scrambling to

401
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:07,140
cut ties with 13th Brother.

402
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:09,209
Much less us,

403
00:25:09,209 --> 00:25:11,199
but for now, no one

404
00:25:11,199 --> 00:25:14,060
dares to speak up for 13th Brother.

405
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:15,700
All this was originally the doing of your faction,

406
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:17,480
so of course, you all must behave more cautiously.

407
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,600
If you are scolding me in your heart, go ahead and say it aloud.

408
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,660
This letter, are you going to reply to it or not?

409
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:32,940
[ Lu'wu, this person is lowly and has no power. ]

410
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:34,480
[ Although I have no hope of any results, ]

411
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,100
[ I will still do my best. ]

412
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:38,520
[ Please wait for my news. ]

413
00:25:41,903 --> 00:25:43,580
[ Take good care of yourself, ]

414
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:45,518
[ if not, you will have no strength ]

415
00:25:45,518 --> 00:25:48,720
[ and then be unable to take care of 13th Prince. ]

416
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,520
For it to be sealed this tight,

417
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:06,540
are you scared I'm going to secretly look at it?

418
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:08,260
It's written for Lu'wu

419
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:09,840
and it is all girl-to-girl talk.

420
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:12,560
I didn't want Lu'wu to feel embarrassed.

421
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:15,680
14th Prince...

422
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:18,360
Please inform your doorkeeper

423
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:21,020
that when he sees Lu'wu, to behave in a courteous manner.

424
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:23,620
Don't worry, I've already done so.

425
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:25,180
To see her or not is up to me,

426
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:27,300
but I won't allow him to be negligent.

427
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:28,720
Thank you very much.

428
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,740
Ruoxi, there are some things

429
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:32,300
I know I shouldn't say, but--

430
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:34,600
Then don't say them.

431
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:45,300
Whether the feelings between you and 4th Brother are real

432
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:46,660
or pretend,

433
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:48,400
it should end here.

434
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,640
You are an intelligent person.

435
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,200
Don't make things hard for yourself unnecessarily.

436
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:05,840
Su'ma'la'gu's favorite season is Autumn.

437
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:06,460
She said

438
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:08,760
that it is more splendid than Spring.

439
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,020
I also remembered

440
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:11,260
Gu'gu standing under the yellow

441
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:13,580
maidenhair tree, smiling and singing songs.

442
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:15,560
The songs she can sing are a lot.

443
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:16,540
On the grasslands,

444
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:18,380
the best singer

445
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:19,300
is not as good as her.

446
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:20,080
Yes.

447
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,620
Emperor,

448
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:23,560
shall I

449
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:25,340
tell you a story to relieve your boredom?

450
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:26,620
Fine.

451
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:29,660
If it is a good story, I will reward you.

452
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:30,980
In the Western Jin dynasty,

453
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:32,740
there was a lady named Lu'zhu.

454
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:35,580
She was a wealthy and famous courtesan.

455
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:38,640
This story I've already heard before.

456
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:42,200
There was a lady named Lin'si'niang.

457
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,180
She was originally a singer from Qin'huai.

458
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:45,280
Later on she became Emperor Qin's

459
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,600
favorite and pampered concubine.

460
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,260
This, I have also heard of.

461
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:50,160
Change it.

462
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:52,360
Emperor, these girls,

463
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:54,300
although they may have had a lowly background,

464
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:55,940
they were chivalrous and full of righteousness.

465
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:57,340
To repay their benefactor's favor and kindness,

466
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:59,220
they sacrificed their lives.

467
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:02,480
Shouldn't they be considered worthy of respect?

468
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:06,340
They can be considered as outstanding women

469
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:10,600
that surpass many men in this world.

470
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,040
Emperor,

471
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,980
what if there is

472
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:18,340
an  outstanding lady willing to repay her benefactor who kindly protected her,

473
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:20,200
even if that meant she would be sacrificed?

474
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,017
That person is

475
00:28:21,017 --> 00:28:23,140
the close female friend of 13th Prince.

476
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:24,860
Her name is Lu Wu.

477
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:26,100
In the capital city, Lu Wu is

478
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:27,380
a famous cultured harlot.

479
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:29,180
I have seen her previously.

480
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:30,380
A pitiful life,

481
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:32,140
but she has a open-minded personality.

482
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:33,160
Her inherent quality

483
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,920
is self-value and self-respect.

484
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,420
Her relationship with 13th Prince was not to use his position

485
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:38,460
to seek any connection.

486
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:40,680
Now that she has heard that 13th Prince is placed under house arrest,

487
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:41,700
she through other people,

488
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:43,620
sent a letter to Ruoxi.

489
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:46,420
Every word of hers is filled with tears and every sentence with real emotion.

490
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:48,600
All she asks for is to suffer together with 13th Prince

491
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:49,860
and to take care of his daily needs.

492
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:51,420
Ruoxi,

493
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:54,860
you are relying on my favor to you.

494
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:57,020
You dare to say anything,

495
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:59,740
you dare to do anything.

496
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:00,540
Li'de'quan.

497
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:01,540
Emperor?

498
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:02,300
Let's go back to the palace.

499
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:03,360
Yes.

500
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,500
Emperor,

501
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:05,960
you are a noble man,

502
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:07,960
please grant Luwu's wish.

503
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:10,080
Your servant is willing to withstand any punishment.

504
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:16,160
Is it her wish or your wish?!

505
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:18,540
Punish you?

506
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:23,000
You couldn't handle my punishment!

507
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:32,200
So all of that was useless.

508
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,031
Lu'wu,

509
00:29:35,031 --> 00:29:37,760
Ruoxi has failed you.

510
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:40,800
How is Ruoxi?

511
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:42,460
Responding to the Emperor,

512
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:45,180
Ruoxi is still bowing in the garden.

513
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:47,840
She is stubborn.

514
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:51,040
No wonder she is called the Death-Seeking 13th Sister.

515
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:54,780
If she wants to bow, let her.

516
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:14,260
My good sister,

517
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:15,900
how can you be so addled?

518
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:18,080
Nobody dares to mention 13th Brother's situation,

519
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,640
how could you?

520
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,740
My Master said

521
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:25,020
he will find the opportunity

522
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:27,200
to help Jie'jie ask for forgiveness,

523
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,840
just endure for a little longer.

524
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:36,440
At this time, Lu'Wu

525
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:38,680
is probably crying inwardly.

526
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:41,040
The lonely 13th Prince

527
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,760
probably can only look up

528
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:45,260
since only stars are his companions.

529
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:50,520
His flute may sound but no one is there to comfort him.

530
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:07,840
Drink.

531
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,356
Drink!

532
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:44,680
Wang'ye.

533
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,940
What?

534
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:49,200
News from the palace.

535
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,320
Today, in the afternoon,

536
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,060
Miss Ruoxi, for 13th Prince's problem,

537
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:53,480
contradicted the Emperor.

538
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:57,144
Now she is kneeling in the garden as a punishment.

539
00:31:58,060 --> 00:31:59,020
Go.

540
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:00,480
Yes.

541
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,860
Two sisters,

542
00:32:57,860 --> 00:32:58,980
they're both the same,

543
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:01,440
having the same stubborn personality.

544
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,600
8th Brother.

545
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,060
Today, Ruoxi had a conflict with Imperial Father.

546
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:06,020
I know.

547
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:08,260
A little quieter,

548
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:09,900
Don't disturb Ruolan.

549
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:12,800
I don't want her to be worried by this.

550
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,620
The news must be kept from 10th Brother too.

551
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:16,160
He's reckless.

552
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,580
I'm scared that after he hears about it,

553
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:18,700
he will do something and get himself in trouble.

554
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:19,920
8th Brother.

555
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:22,460
Do you have any solution to save Ruoxi?

556
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:24,780
You also know what the current situation is,

557
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:26,020
nobody can save her.

558
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:27,140
But you know Ruoxi's temperament--

559
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:29,600
Okay, don't say anything more.

560
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:33,180
You should also look out for yourself.

561
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:35,360
Don't do any useless actions.

562
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:09,660
Jie'jie, what are you doing?

563
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:11,020
You didn't come home at all last night.

564
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:13,160
I only heard this morning that your punishment is to kneel in the garden.

565
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:14,839
What happened?

566
00:34:14,839 --> 00:34:16,179
Go back.

567
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:18,300
Right now, the Emperor is really angry.

568
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:19,620
If he knows you came to see me,

569
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:20,900
you will also be involved.

570
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:22,240
Jie'jie.

571
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:23,500
Hurry up and leave.

572
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:25,760
You don't even listen to my words.

573
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:20,600
Here.

574
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:27,220
Wear this.

575
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:29,040
The weather may change unexpectedly.

576
00:35:56,220 --> 00:36:00,520
[ Winds blow and rain pours. When will it end? ]

577
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:05,900
[ This crude window and house, everyone says it is secluded.]

578
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:10,460
[ I am drinking leftover wine and remembering yesterday.]

579
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:17,120
[ Yesterday it was a beauty's hands lighting red candles. Today suddenly I've become a hoary head.] (Became grey-haired)

580
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:51,400
During this rain,

581
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:53,500
someone's willing to stand next to me, to

582
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:58,840
bear and suffer this pain with me.

583
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:15,980
Go back.

584
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:19,600
Your caring and thoughtfulness, I have already accepted them.

585
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,520
Ruoxi, how could you dare?

586
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:19,280
Even if you don't love yourself,

587
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:23,040
you should care about Ruolan.

588
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,960
Your body is weak to begin with.

589
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:32,220
Why do you cause her to worry?

590
00:40:32,529 --> 00:40:33,186
I've commanded that no one

591
00:40:33,186 --> 00:40:35,151
may gossip about you.

592
00:40:35,151 --> 00:40:37,573
But how long can that secret last?

593
00:41:00,632 --> 00:41:02,047
Let's go back.

594
00:41:03,404 --> 00:41:05,276
8th Brother, you leave first.

595
00:41:05,276 --> 00:41:07,248
I have some things to ask her.

596
00:41:10,106 --> 00:41:12,728
Right now, you and I are both helpless.

597
00:41:12,728 --> 00:41:15,486
We can only look at her good fortune.

598
00:41:15,486 --> 00:41:17,204
Even 4th Prince

599
00:41:17,204 --> 00:41:19,573
can only watch.

600
00:41:19,573 --> 00:41:21,616
Tackling this situation with emotions is not only useless,

601
00:41:21,616 --> 00:41:24,709
but it will also enrage the Emperor.

602
00:41:24,709 --> 00:41:26,508
8th Brother, I just have a few things

603
00:41:26,508 --> 00:41:28,773
to clarify.

604
00:41:28,773 --> 00:41:31,352
This game of chess is ending.

605
00:41:31,352 --> 00:41:33,905
Victory is before our eyes,

606
00:41:34,851 --> 00:41:36,623
but one wrong move

607
00:41:36,623 --> 00:41:39,849
can lose the entire game. There are many examples of this.

608
00:42:04,852 --> 00:42:06,113
Slower.

609
00:42:06,113 --> 00:42:08,967
Be careful not to choke, there's no water here.

610
00:42:11,810 --> 00:42:15,377
The Emperor didn't give me permission to eat.

611
00:42:15,377 --> 00:42:16,631
But you already ate it.

612
00:42:16,631 --> 00:42:19,046
1 piece or 2 pieces, there's no difference.

613
00:42:19,046 --> 00:42:20,950
And also, such a big rain,

614
00:42:20,950 --> 00:42:22,132
who will come this far

615
00:42:22,132 --> 00:42:23,379
to punish you.

616
00:42:23,379 --> 00:42:24,897
And I placed it in my shirt,

617
00:42:24,897 --> 00:42:26,916
so no one will know.

618
00:42:38,258 --> 00:42:40,383
What are you doing?

619
00:42:41,051 --> 00:42:42,870
Nature's water is the cleanest.

620
00:42:42,870 --> 00:42:43,752
Elegant scholars

621
00:42:43,752 --> 00:42:45,470
save it especially to make tea.

622
00:42:45,470 --> 00:42:47,699
I really must take note from now on,

623
00:42:47,699 --> 00:42:50,207
there's no way you are ladylike.

624
00:42:50,207 --> 00:42:53,990
Ruoxi, is it worth it doing this?

625
00:42:55,634 --> 00:42:57,613
Answer me.

626
00:42:59,170 --> 00:43:01,678
Ruoxi, answer me.

627
00:43:01,678 --> 00:43:03,835
I'm begging you.

628
00:43:09,008 --> 00:43:10,641
I only did

629
00:43:10,641 --> 00:43:12,213
what I felt I should do

630
00:43:12,213 --> 00:43:14,588
and what must be done.

631
00:43:14,588 --> 00:43:17,767
There is no worth it or not worth it.

632
00:43:18,350 --> 00:43:20,904
If you really want the reason,

633
00:43:20,904 --> 00:43:23,505
I can only say,

634
00:43:23,505 --> 00:43:25,269
if 13th Prince were to

635
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:27,452
encounter the same situation,

636
00:43:27,452 --> 00:43:28,427
he would definitely

637
00:43:28,427 --> 00:43:29,820
do the same for me.

638
00:43:29,820 --> 00:43:32,096
Even though he knows the consequences would be unpredictable.

639
00:43:32,096 --> 00:43:33,675
If it were me instead,

640
00:43:33,675 --> 00:43:36,808
you would do the same, right?

641
00:43:39,380 --> 00:43:42,300
I know you are thinking

642
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:44,156
if I were 13th Brother,

643
00:43:44,156 --> 00:43:46,067
I would definitely not be asking you this.

644
00:43:46,067 --> 00:43:47,175
He understands you.

645
00:43:47,175 --> 00:43:48,629
But this is because I don't understand you,

646
00:43:48,629 --> 00:43:50,617
that I have to make this clear.

647
00:43:50,617 --> 00:43:53,040
Ruoxi, tell me the truth.

648
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:54,062
Based on the fact that

649
00:43:54,062 --> 00:43:56,173
we've known each other since young.

650
00:43:56,570 --> 00:43:59,481
I didn't think that way.

651
00:43:59,481 --> 00:44:02,500
Whether it was 10th Prince or you

652
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:04,604
I would do it.

653
00:44:04,604 --> 00:44:06,036
Although my personality

654
00:44:06,036 --> 00:44:08,094
is closest to 13th prince,

655
00:44:08,094 --> 00:44:10,502
my feelings for everyone are the same.

656
00:44:10,502 --> 00:44:11,756
And that day on the grasslands?

657
00:44:11,756 --> 00:44:12,724
Even if it wasn't because of 8th Brother

658
00:44:12,724 --> 00:44:15,167
you would have still helped me, right?

659
00:44:18,304 --> 00:44:21,376
You're all wet. Go back.

660
00:44:21,376 --> 00:44:23,412
When the Emperor's temper subsides,

661
00:44:23,412 --> 00:44:25,570
all will be fine.

662
00:44:29,907 --> 00:44:31,060
I'm already wet,

663
00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:33,363
can I get any wetter?

664
00:44:33,363 --> 00:44:35,170
And also,

665
00:44:35,170 --> 00:44:39,120
the Emperor didn't allow me to hold an umbrella.

666
00:45:18,980 --> 00:45:20,520
Wang'ye.

667
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:27,300
Wang'ye.

668
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:29,120
Wang'ye, I know your heart hurts,

669
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:30,640
but you can't ruin your health.

670
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:32,840
Go back inside, Wang'ye.

671
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:36,440
Wang'ye, please go back inside.

672
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:42,660
Wang'ye, I'm begging you!

673
00:45:42,660 --> 00:45:46,040
Please go back inside, Wang'ye!

674
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:49,900
Go back inside, I beg you Wang'ye!

675
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:53,980
Go back inside, I'm begging you.

676
00:45:53,980 --> 00:45:58,060
Wang'ye, Wang'ye!

677
00:45:58,060 --> 00:46:00,520
Take Fu'jin back inside.

678
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:04,180
Without my permission,

679
00:46:04,180 --> 00:46:06,700
no one can come out.

680
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:07,880
- Yes,Master.
- Wang'ye!

681
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:09,740
Wang'ye, come back inside. Wang'ye.

682
00:46:09,740 --> 00:46:11,140
- Wang'ye.
-  Mistress.

683
00:46:11,140 --> 00:46:12,660
- Wang'ye!
- Mistress.

684
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:15,320
Come in, Mistress.

685
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:24,000
Ruoxi, no matter how big this rain is

686
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,760
I will be with you.

687
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:04,820
