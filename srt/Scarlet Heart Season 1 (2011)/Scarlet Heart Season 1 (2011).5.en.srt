Scarlet Heart
- Episode 5 -

3
00:02:03,567 --> 00:02:04,800
We must pick a good horse.

4
00:02:05,533 --> 00:02:06,133
Great!

5
00:02:06,133 --> 00:02:06,967
Crown Prince,

6
00:02:06,967 --> 00:02:08,267
why don't we have a bet?

7
00:02:08,833 --> 00:02:09,800
Sure!

8
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,233
All right, place your bet!

9
00:02:11,233 --> 00:02:12,000
Let's begin!

10
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,433
Check that one out.

11
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,133
Great!

12
00:02:16,133 --> 00:02:17,167
I'm betting on that horse!

13
00:02:17,167 --> 00:02:18,567
Yes, this one!

14
00:02:18,567 --> 00:02:21,433
Fourteenth Brother, then do you know

15
00:02:21,433 --> 00:02:23,433
what "equal rights" are?

16
00:02:23,433 --> 00:02:25,633
What kind of thing is that? I've never heard of it.

17
00:02:25,633 --> 00:02:26,833
That means to say

18
00:02:26,833 --> 00:02:28,867
that when everyone is born,

19
00:02:28,867 --> 00:02:30,400
there are no class differences,

20
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,700
no distinction or discrimination between different identities.

21
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:33,100
Everyone is born equal.

22
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:35,733
Everyone can live as they want.

23
00:02:35,733 --> 00:02:37,600
Even the Emperor

24
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:40,300
has no right to manipulate other people's lives any way he wants.

25
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:41,567
How can that be possible?

26
00:02:41,567 --> 00:02:42,967
We have monarchs and their subjects.

27
00:02:42,967 --> 00:02:44,033
A person's status

28
00:02:44,033 --> 00:02:45,500
is determined at birth.

29
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,767
You and I were born as princes,

30
00:02:46,767 --> 00:02:48,033
so we live as princes.

31
00:02:48,033 --> 00:02:48,800
Besides,

32
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,000
how can you not even obey the Emperor?

33
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,967
If there were such treasonous actions,

34
00:02:51,967 --> 00:02:52,933
there would be no order or decorum.

35
00:02:52,933 --> 00:02:53,967
Well... perhaps it might be

36
00:02:53,967 --> 00:02:55,900
yet another kind of utopia.

37
00:02:56,267 --> 00:02:57,733
Everybody can speak their minds freely,

38
00:02:57,733 --> 00:02:59,300
without any fear.

39
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:01,633
People love freely, and choose their own life companions.

40
00:03:01,633 --> 00:03:04,967
Thirteenth Brother, what "equal rights"?

41
00:03:04,967 --> 00:03:07,333
That would mean disregarding the very basis of our societal structure

42
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:08,367
and going against all of our Confucian teachings.

43
00:03:08,367 --> 00:03:09,900
This is completely unorthodox!

44
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:12,133
I don't want to listen to such talk.

45
00:03:12,133 --> 00:03:13,500
Ruoxi said

46
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,567
that is how "modern people" think.

47
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,600
"Modern" people"?

48
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,233
Here comes the unorthodox "modern" person.

49
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,633
Good day, Sister-in-Law.

50
00:03:26,033 --> 00:03:27,067
Greetings to Thirteenth Prince.

51
00:03:27,067 --> 00:03:28,100
Greetings to Fourteenth Prince.

52
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:30,400
- Rise
- Good day, Princes.

53
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,433
Did Ruoxi say some

54
00:03:33,433 --> 00:03:35,467
unorthodox things again?

55
00:03:35,467 --> 00:03:37,633
Just now, Thirteenth Brother and I were discussing

56
00:03:37,633 --> 00:03:39,300
what "equal rights" are.

57
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:40,567
We're not trying to be judgmental,

58
00:03:40,567 --> 00:03:41,900
it's just...

59
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:45,233
Ruoxi, what do you mean by "modern" person?

60
00:03:48,633 --> 00:03:51,100
A "modern" person is....

61
00:03:57,967 --> 00:04:01,067
- Great!
- Wonderful!

62
00:04:01,067 --> 00:04:02,900
Jiejie, who is that?

63
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:08,633
Great!

64
00:04:09,933 --> 00:04:11,567
Why is it her?

65
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:22,367
Who'd have thought that her horse-riding skills were so good?

66
00:04:22,367 --> 00:04:25,433
In the palace, the Guoluoluo sisters are famous for their riding skills,

67
00:04:25,433 --> 00:04:26,767
didn't you know?

68
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:28,733
That's because you like her.

69
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,433
What?

70
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:38,667
Tenth Brother, I didn't know Sister-in-Law's riding skills were so good.

71
00:04:38,667 --> 00:04:40,133
Better than yours!

72
00:04:40,133 --> 00:04:41,433
Better than mine?

73
00:04:41,433 --> 00:04:42,933
Want me to go out there and show you?

74
00:04:42,933 --> 00:04:43,767
Go ahead!

75
00:04:43,767 --> 00:04:44,900
I...

76
00:04:49,167 --> 00:04:50,033
Tenth Brother.

77
00:04:50,033 --> 00:04:52,900
Look at how hard your Fujin has been working, shouldn't you be going to help her off the horse?

78
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,467
- Hurry and go!
- Hurry and go.

79
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,067
Thrilling!

80
00:05:12,067 --> 00:05:14,933
Today's horse racing has been simply thrilling.

81
00:05:14,933 --> 00:05:17,533
Too bad Fourth Brother couldn't make it.

82
00:05:17,533 --> 00:05:18,833
Such a shame.

83
00:05:19,933 --> 00:05:21,900
Imperial Father has always praised

84
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:24,267
the ladies from Guoluoluo family

85
00:05:24,267 --> 00:05:27,500
for best exemplifying our valiant Manchurian horseback riding style.

86
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,533
You have definitely proved

87
00:05:28,533 --> 00:05:30,767
it today.

88
00:05:30,767 --> 00:05:32,167
Crown Prince flatters me too much.

89
00:05:32,167 --> 00:05:35,500
Imperial Father was praising my sister when he said that,

90
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,567
I wouldn't dare to pretend this word of praise was directed at me.

91
00:05:36,567 --> 00:05:39,367
Although your sister's riding skills are very good,

92
00:05:39,367 --> 00:05:41,767
but in my opinion, you're even better than her.

93
00:05:41,767 --> 00:05:43,467
Thank you, Crown Prince!

94
00:05:49,667 --> 00:05:52,167
I heard that General Maertai's daughters

95
00:05:52,167 --> 00:05:53,900
were all raised in the barracks.

96
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:55,267
All of them are brilliant at riding.

97
00:05:55,267 --> 00:05:58,067
Why don't you take today as an opportunity to showcase your skills,

98
00:05:58,067 --> 00:05:59,767
and let it be an eye-opener for us all.

99
00:05:59,767 --> 00:06:01,400
Good idea.

100
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,867
Then let it be an eye-opener for us then.

101
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:07,300
Maertai Ruoxi,

102
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,933
since you're dressed to ride,

103
00:06:08,933 --> 00:06:11,000
why don't you go out there and showcase your skills?

104
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:15,433
Mingyu!

105
00:06:17,002 --> 00:06:19,000
Don't tell me

106
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,867
you don't know how to ride?

107
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:27,067
Looks like the rumors were just rumors.

108
00:06:27,067 --> 00:06:29,700
And I thought that everyone in General Maertai's army

109
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,867
were skilled horsemen

110
00:06:31,867 --> 00:06:33,600
with outstanding horse-riding capabilities.

111
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,067
But now, it seems like

112
00:06:35,067 --> 00:06:36,867
there isn't any truth in those rumors.

113
00:06:41,267 --> 00:06:42,367
Crown Prince,

114
00:06:42,367 --> 00:06:46,567
I was once trained in Father's army,

115
00:06:48,267 --> 00:06:49,500
so

116
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:56,000
I'm willing to perform for everyone so as to add to the fun of things.

117
00:07:22,033 --> 00:07:23,767
Jiejie is amazing!

118
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:33,900
This is truly breathtaking.

119
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,267
A valiant heroine!

120
00:07:35,733 --> 00:07:37,467
She rides a horse as nimbly as if she were a flying swallow.

121
00:07:37,467 --> 00:07:38,100
Sure does!

122
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:40,467
Unlike someone who rides like a flying bear.

123
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,533
What's a "flying bear on horseback"?

124
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,500
Hey, what the heck!

125
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,333
Eighth Consort is really outstanding.

126
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,767
- Yes.
- Super cool!

127
00:08:00,033 --> 00:08:03,700
Great! Great! Marvellous riding skills!

128
00:08:04,033 --> 00:08:06,100
Great! Great! Amazing!

129
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:08,733
Simply amazing! Great!

130
00:08:12,367 --> 00:08:13,833
Jiejie!

131
00:08:13,833 --> 00:08:16,600
Great! It was just splendid!

132
00:08:23,167 --> 00:08:24,900
Jiejie!

133
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:27,700
Jiejie,

134
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:30,067
you've won back the Maertai family's reputation!

135
00:08:30,067 --> 00:08:32,267
You were simply amazing today!

136
00:08:32,267 --> 00:08:35,667
It's nothing. Everyone else is just as good.

137
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,767
Amazing! Come here!

138
00:08:45,767 --> 00:08:48,100
Eighth Consort rode pretty well.

139
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:49,700
Thank you, Crown Prince.

140
00:08:55,633 --> 00:08:57,733
I never thought that Jiejie would be so skilled.

141
00:08:57,733 --> 00:08:59,900
But... why does her expression seem

142
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:01,533
so dejected?

143
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:06,167
Eighth Brother, Eighth Consort rides much better than you do.

144
00:09:06,167 --> 00:09:06,867
- That's right.
- Yes.

145
00:09:06,867 --> 00:09:08,967
Her skills are really outstanding.

146
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:12,533
Why is Eighth Prince this way as well?

147
00:09:12,533 --> 00:09:13,900
His smile...

148
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:16,100
No matter how you look at it, it still looks pained.

149
00:09:16,567 --> 00:09:19,500
What in the world happened between them?

150
00:09:31,377 --> 00:09:33,200
Greetings to Bei'le.

151
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,367
Rise.

152
00:09:36,233 --> 00:09:38,700
All these years, you wouldn't even go near the stables,

153
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,833
let alone horseback riding.

154
00:09:41,567 --> 00:09:42,667
But just now,

155
00:09:42,667 --> 00:09:45,333
you showcased your skills to the fullest extent.

156
00:09:46,933 --> 00:09:48,095
Ruolan, did you know?

157
00:09:48,095 --> 00:09:50,967
Everyone was captivated by you just now.

158
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:55,943
You are at your most alluring

159
00:09:55,943 --> 00:09:58,367
when you are on horseback.

160
00:09:58,367 --> 00:10:00,433
But I'm tired.

161
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,200
I'm exhausted, both physically and mentally.

162
00:10:05,667 --> 00:10:08,267
I never ever want to ride a horse again.

163
00:10:20,848 --> 00:10:22,267
Ruolan,

164
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,600
there's only the two of us here.

165
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,033
Are you willing to speak with me frankly?

166
00:10:30,033 --> 00:10:32,433
Bei'le, it's getting late,

167
00:10:32,433 --> 00:10:34,033
it's time we returned back to the estate to rest.

168
00:10:34,033 --> 00:10:38,933
Ruolan, no matter how painful the past was, it's all in the past now.

169
00:10:38,933 --> 00:10:40,967
It's time you let go of it.

170
00:10:41,538 --> 00:10:42,839
There can still be

171
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:45,533
many happy days ahead for us.

172
00:10:45,533 --> 00:10:47,793
We can still have other children together.

173
00:10:47,793 --> 00:10:49,187
Although,

174
00:10:49,908 --> 00:10:51,433
we'd lost one...

175
00:10:51,433 --> 00:10:53,667
Bei'le, please don't go on.

176
00:10:53,667 --> 00:10:56,100
I'm not asking you to do anything for me.

177
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:58,267
I just can't can't bear

178
00:10:58,267 --> 00:11:00,067
seeing you so miserable day after day.

179
00:11:01,122 --> 00:11:02,954
Was marrying me

180
00:11:02,954 --> 00:11:05,812
just to make you suffer?

181
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:10,920
As a prince, don't I

182
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,428
even have the ability to make my wife happy?

183
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,116
Ruolan, what do I have to do

184
00:11:20,116 --> 00:11:22,112
to give you happiness?

185
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:24,667
Bei'le

186
00:11:24,667 --> 00:11:26,710
has already done a lot for me.

187
00:11:27,546 --> 00:11:31,000
Bei'le does not have to do anything more for Ruolan.

188
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,633
We are already husband and wife.

189
00:11:32,633 --> 00:11:34,700
Don't tell me we are going to live the rest of our lives like we are now.

190
00:11:37,533 --> 00:11:40,300
We are even more estranged than two chance acquaintances.

191
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:44,450
If Bei'le is willing,

192
00:11:45,193 --> 00:11:48,723
Ruolan is willing to live like that, too.

193
00:11:51,045 --> 00:11:53,867
Ruolan, it's precisely because I can't do it.

194
00:11:53,867 --> 00:11:57,933
I would rather you be angry at me or hate me. I will do everything I can to make it up to you.

195
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,133
But I cannot bear

196
00:12:00,133 --> 00:12:02,367
your coldness towards me.

197
00:12:03,467 --> 00:12:04,967
Could it be

198
00:12:05,533 --> 00:12:08,167
you don't feel anything at all for me?

199
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:27,035
I understand.

200
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,200
You don't resist

201
00:12:31,772 --> 00:12:35,000
because your grief,

202
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,433
your helplessness, and your pain,

203
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:42,400
is the greatest torture you can inflict

204
00:12:42,867 --> 00:12:45,200
on yourself and me.

205
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:47,700
Right?

206
00:12:52,867 --> 00:12:57,933
There will never be a place in your heart for me again.

207
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,667
I'm sorry.

208
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,533
I'll make a move first.

209
00:13:27,767 --> 00:13:29,800
His marriage was bestowed by the Emperor.

210
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,300
They've been through the proper marriage rites,

211
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:33,033
and will remain husband and wife for the rest of their lives.

212
00:13:33,033 --> 00:13:34,933
However angry you are, there's no use.

213
00:13:34,933 --> 00:13:36,400
Likewise, likewise.

214
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,300
What do you mean?

215
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:40,667
Do I have to say it?

216
00:13:40,667 --> 00:13:42,400
"A man should take a wife and a woman a husband."

217
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:45,867
"King Xiang has dream, but the Goddess is unwilling".
(proverb from folklore implying a hopeless, forbidden love)

218
00:13:47,067 --> 00:13:51,567
I see, someone is carelessly match-making,

219
00:13:51,567 --> 00:13:53,500
and actually thinking that I like Mingyu.

220
00:13:55,633 --> 00:13:56,867
Isn't that the case?

221
00:13:59,633 --> 00:14:00,467
Well then,

222
00:14:00,467 --> 00:14:02,033
I'll tell you frankly, too.

223
00:14:02,033 --> 00:14:03,600
You've misunderstood also.

224
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,133
I'm not in love with Tenth Prince.

225
00:14:06,133 --> 00:14:08,100
Then we're even.

226
00:14:09,167 --> 00:14:10,400
But...

227
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,367
on the night that Mingyu and Tenth Prince got married,

228
00:14:12,367 --> 00:14:14,133
you were clearly very sad.

229
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:20,367
If you find it difficult to talk about, then there's no need to tell me.

230
00:14:21,833 --> 00:14:22,900
Yes.

231
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:26,067
I was indeed very sad that night.

232
00:14:26,067 --> 00:14:29,500
It was because, that day

233
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,533
was my mother's death anniversary.

234
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,767
She died on the same day, many, many years ago.

235
00:14:35,767 --> 00:14:38,133
Imperial Father has probably forgotten already.

236
00:14:38,133 --> 00:14:41,333
But since you don't like Tenth Brother,

237
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:43,333
why do you do so much for him?

238
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:45,933
Singing and folding paper cranes for him.

239
00:14:46,767 --> 00:14:48,167
Do you know what Lady of Red Sleeves was doing,

240
00:14:48,167 --> 00:14:50,033
the legendary beauty in Tang Dynasty folklore,

241
00:14:50,033 --> 00:14:52,467
when Qiu Ranke first met her?

242
00:14:52,467 --> 00:14:56,267
She was... brushing her hair.
(Meaning the man did not fall for the beauty even though he witnessed a beautiful moment)

243
00:14:56,833 --> 00:15:00,900
Like Qiu Ranke and Lady of Red Sleeves, there can also exist a relationship between a man and a woman,

244
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,633
who care for each other,

245
00:15:02,633 --> 00:15:06,833
without intentions of love or lust, but only out of sincerity.

246
00:15:07,433 --> 00:15:11,167
The phrase "without intentions of love or lust, but only out of sincerity" is well said indeed.

247
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,500
Why don't...

248
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:15,633
We go for a drink?

249
00:15:15,633 --> 00:15:16,667
Let's go!

250
00:15:25,733 --> 00:15:27,333
Let's go!

251
00:15:34,113 --> 00:15:35,433
Thirteenth Prince!

252
00:15:37,433 --> 00:15:38,833
Thirteenth Prince,

253
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:40,333
do come in.

254
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,546
Why didn't you give us warning beforehand that you were coming?

255
00:15:43,546 --> 00:15:44,733
No harm. No harm.

256
00:15:44,733 --> 00:15:46,267
I'll go tell the Lady at once,

257
00:15:46,267 --> 00:15:48,343
and have her hurry and get rid of the customer and come over.

258
00:15:48,343 --> 00:15:49,444
It's all right.

259
00:15:49,444 --> 00:15:52,230
Today, I'm just here to have a drink with my friend.

260
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:53,716
Just prepare some wine and food.

261
00:15:53,716 --> 00:15:56,367
Yes, I'll go now to get everything ready.

262
00:15:58,033 --> 00:15:59,767
Your female bosom friend?

263
00:16:01,033 --> 00:16:02,567
When I'm bored or frustrated,

264
00:16:02,567 --> 00:16:04,033
I'll come here for a drink

265
00:16:04,033 --> 00:16:05,300
and to chat a little.

266
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:07,167
We get along all right.

267
00:16:12,167 --> 00:16:14,700
Stop "ohh"ing, let's go!

268
00:16:22,195 --> 00:16:23,531
I'm guessing that this lady

269
00:16:23,531 --> 00:16:25,367
must be a courtesan, right?

270
00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:29,400
Do you look down on such women?

271
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:32,540
No, everyone is equal.

272
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:33,833
Have you forgotten?

273
00:16:34,816 --> 00:16:37,900
Thirteenth Prince, Miss Luwu is here.

274
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,233
Luwu,

275
00:16:58,233 --> 00:17:01,733
this is the "Go-All-Out Thirteenth Sister" whom I've often mentioned to you.

276
00:17:02,767 --> 00:17:04,862
It's an honor to meet you at last.

277
00:17:04,862 --> 00:17:07,733
You flatter me.

278
00:17:07,733 --> 00:17:08,994
Say, shouldn't the three of us

279
00:17:08,994 --> 00:17:10,388
have a few drinks?

280
00:17:10,388 --> 00:17:11,833
Sure!

281
00:17:17,367 --> 00:17:18,133
Just like this,

282
00:17:18,133 --> 00:17:20,300
the three of us talked about everything from trivial happenings in the palace

283
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,666
to interesting stories through the times.

284
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:23,800
From the expansive deserts of the North

285
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,233
to the misty rains of Jiangnan.

286
00:17:25,233 --> 00:17:27,067
From poems of mountains and rivers

287
00:17:27,067 --> 00:17:28,367
to the philosophers and wise men through the ages.

288
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,033
Cheers.

289
00:17:34,767 --> 00:17:35,600
You're also

290
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,033
an admirer of Ji Kang?

291
00:17:37,033 --> 00:17:38,167
Of course!

292
00:17:38,167 --> 00:17:40,633
Ji Kang's "instead of following famed ethics, let there be anarchy (individual freedom)".

293
00:17:40,633 --> 00:17:41,867
If I were to use your words to express it,

294
00:17:41,867 --> 00:17:46,567
he believes everyone has the right to pursue his or her own happiness,

295
00:17:46,567 --> 00:17:47,900
unrestricted by those wielding power.

296
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,267
Isn't that... what's that word...

297
00:17:50,267 --> 00:17:51,933
"liberalism"?

298
00:17:51,933 --> 00:17:53,300
That's right!

299
00:17:58,300 --> 00:17:59,433
You two,

300
00:17:59,433 --> 00:18:00,967
one's a prince,

301
00:18:00,967 --> 00:18:03,067
one a sheltered noble lady,

302
00:18:03,067 --> 00:18:05,367
yet neither of you care about your wealth and status,

303
00:18:05,367 --> 00:18:06,867
and dare to question the status quo.

304
00:18:06,867 --> 00:18:08,600
It truly is admirable.

305
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,500
Luwu,

306
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,967
aren't you the same as us, too?

307
00:18:10,967 --> 00:18:12,767
Like us, you don't have the freedom to do as you wish.

308
00:18:12,767 --> 00:18:14,933
And like us, you crave the ability to spend your days carefreely

309
00:18:14,933 --> 00:18:16,433
and without restrictions.

310
00:18:17,867 --> 00:18:19,267
You're absolutely right...

311
00:18:19,267 --> 00:18:20,900
Awesome! I never thought that

312
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,700
I would meet two soulmates here!

313
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:25,167
To the three of us

314
00:18:25,167 --> 00:18:27,300
ancient people with modern ideas. Cheers!

315
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:28,667
Cheers!

316
00:18:28,667 --> 00:18:30,833
Come. Cheers!

317
00:19:04,267 --> 00:19:06,400
Greetings to Thirteenth Prince and Second Miss.

318
00:19:08,767 --> 00:19:11,600
Greetings to Thirteenth Prince and Second Miss.

319
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,333
You should go back first.

320
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:17,900
It's fine for me to go in on my own.

321
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:21,067
Don't worry. Even though I returned late,

322
00:19:21,067 --> 00:19:22,567
they won't make things difficult for me.

323
00:19:22,567 --> 00:19:24,433
It's best that I let Eighth Brother know first.

324
00:19:26,467 --> 00:19:29,033
Sorry, I got back late.

325
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,633
Ruoxi, didn't you say the last time

326
00:19:35,633 --> 00:19:38,767
that there wouldn't be a second time?

327
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,167
I notice Jiejie

328
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:12,367
often looks at the man on the screen.

329
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:15,933
Could it be that you know him?

330
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:22,933
My riding skills were taught to me by him.

331
00:20:25,233 --> 00:20:26,700
Then...

332
00:20:27,333 --> 00:20:29,700
he's the one Jiejie likes?

333
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:37,167
Back then, Bei'le

334
00:20:37,167 --> 00:20:39,167
asked Father for my hand in marriage.

335
00:20:39,933 --> 00:20:42,433
I married Eighth Prince as decreed,

336
00:20:42,433 --> 00:20:44,133
and became his Cefujin.

337
00:20:45,475 --> 00:20:47,367
I had knelt and begged Father to not force me to marry

338
00:20:47,867 --> 00:20:51,117
but the result was still the same.

339
00:20:51,533 --> 00:20:54,300
After getting married to Eighth Prince,

340
00:20:54,867 --> 00:20:57,467
I became pregnant with his child.

341
00:20:57,467 --> 00:20:58,967
Then shouldn't everything

342
00:20:58,967 --> 00:21:01,133
have come to an end?

343
00:21:04,097 --> 00:21:06,933
When I was 3 months pregnant,

344
00:21:07,667 --> 00:21:10,133
I received news

345
00:21:10,567 --> 00:21:15,600
saying that the General had suddenly died in battle.

346
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:20,933
After I found out, I was very sad

347
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:24,333
and fell seriously ill,

348
00:21:24,333 --> 00:21:26,933
and even lost the child.

349
00:21:32,467 --> 00:21:35,067
It was Eighth Prince.

350
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,867
It was him.

351
00:21:38,867 --> 00:21:42,666
He was the one who sent men to investigate the General.

352
00:21:43,667 --> 00:21:47,300
That's why Father sent him to be a frontline soldier.

353
00:21:54,267 --> 00:21:56,598
Even though I didn't kill him,

354
00:21:56,598 --> 00:21:59,633
he died because of me.

355
00:22:36,867 --> 00:22:39,133
What I did with Thirteenth Prince last night

356
00:22:39,133 --> 00:22:41,367
is something I often did in modern times,

357
00:22:41,367 --> 00:22:42,967
but in olden times,

358
00:22:42,967 --> 00:22:45,167
such an ordinary thing

359
00:22:45,167 --> 00:22:47,500
is actually unacceptable to the people around me?

360
00:22:48,233 --> 00:22:50,633
I've already lost many things here.

361
00:22:50,633 --> 00:22:53,567
I don't want to be robbed of my right to make friends as well!

362
00:22:54,292 --> 00:22:55,167
Even though doing so

363
00:22:55,167 --> 00:22:56,700
will make things difficult for Jiejie.

364
00:22:57,167 --> 00:22:59,800
I believe, Jiejie will still help me.

365
00:23:00,467 --> 00:23:02,967
To be able to find a soulmate in this dynasty,

366
00:23:02,967 --> 00:23:04,833
the more I think about it, the happier I feel.

367
00:23:04,833 --> 00:23:07,906
I wish that I could go find him and have a drink together right this minute!

368
00:23:09,567 --> 00:23:11,800
Miss, what are you drawing?

369
00:23:14,167 --> 00:23:16,167
I'm drawing galloping horses.

370
00:23:18,067 --> 00:23:19,933
Manga version!

371
00:23:19,933 --> 00:23:20,867
What is manga?

372
00:23:20,867 --> 00:23:22,033
Second Miss.

373
00:23:22,033 --> 00:23:24,700
Master asked Second Miss to come to the study.

374
00:23:25,267 --> 00:23:26,200
Second Miss,

375
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:29,687
it's probably regarding you going out to drink with Thirteenth Prince last night.

376
00:23:39,167 --> 00:23:40,533
Please.

377
00:23:55,467 --> 00:23:57,133
Greetings to Eighth Prince.

378
00:24:02,264 --> 00:24:03,600
Excused.

379
00:24:24,133 --> 00:24:27,200
Where did you go with Thirteenth Prince yesterday?

380
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:31,467
Thirteenth prince didn't tell you?

381
00:24:31,467 --> 00:24:33,133
I'm asking you right now.

382
00:24:34,833 --> 00:24:37,900
Thirteenth Prince brought me to a place to drink.

383
00:24:46,767 --> 00:24:48,367
Come here.

384
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,167
Come here.

385
00:25:09,667 --> 00:25:11,500
Am I really that scary?

386
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:36,375
Don't move.

387
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:01,867
The Internal Bureau Official will be here soon.

388
00:26:01,867 --> 00:26:03,633
Head back first.

389
00:26:12,167 --> 00:26:13,100
Yes.

390
00:26:37,433 --> 00:26:39,400
Come, eat some more.

391
00:26:41,033 --> 00:26:42,000
Here.

392
00:26:42,633 --> 00:26:43,933
Thank you.

393
00:26:45,033 --> 00:26:46,700
Where did this bracelet come from?

394
00:26:55,033 --> 00:26:57,800
This is the rare Phoenix Blood Jade.

395
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:03,833
Thirteenth Brother is so good to you.

396
00:27:03,833 --> 00:27:05,144
Among all the princes,

397
00:27:05,144 --> 00:27:07,867
Thirteenth Brother is the most outstanding.

398
00:27:07,867 --> 00:27:10,667
He has a heroism that others don't have.

399
00:27:13,467 --> 00:27:15,593
But I still have to remind you...

400
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:17,767
For some things,

401
00:27:17,767 --> 00:27:20,400
if you cannot control the outcome,

402
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,333
then you should never think about it.

403
00:27:26,467 --> 00:27:27,967
Understand?

404
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,167
I understand.

405
00:27:37,267 --> 00:27:39,300
Maiden selection...

406
00:27:44,333 --> 00:27:46,267
A man should set his sights afar.

407
00:27:46,267 --> 00:27:48,133
Naturally, I do not expect all of you

408
00:27:48,133 --> 00:27:49,733
to stay by my side all the time.

409
00:27:49,733 --> 00:27:50,833
Imperial Father,

410
00:27:50,833 --> 00:27:52,300
regarding the Shandong river regulation construction...

411
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:53,367
It's the New Year.

412
00:27:53,367 --> 00:27:55,300
Let's not talk about work anymore.

413
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:56,400
Yes.

414
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:59,333
I heard that the maiden selections are in a few days?

415
00:27:59,667 --> 00:28:01,033
Yes.

416
00:28:02,033 --> 00:28:05,300
Your family's Ruoxi will also be in the selection, right?

417
00:28:06,033 --> 00:28:07,700
Yes, Imperial Father.

418
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:13,467
This child is quite clever.

419
00:28:20,833 --> 00:28:22,167
Looking at the current situation,

420
00:28:22,167 --> 00:28:24,833
Ruoxi's chance of getting chosen is very high.

421
00:28:24,833 --> 00:28:26,467
Given her personality,

422
00:28:26,467 --> 00:28:28,133
if that were to happen,

423
00:28:28,133 --> 00:28:30,867
it'd be worse than death for her.

424
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,800
This triannual maiden selection

425
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:40,700
is the nightmare of many girls from Eight Banners families.

426
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,300
If she catches His Majesty's eyes,

427
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:45,967
and is chosen to be a concubine,

428
00:28:46,233 --> 00:28:48,233
then she will be trapped in the palace.

429
00:28:48,233 --> 00:28:50,400
She'll be trapped in the palace.

430
00:28:51,867 --> 00:28:54,000
Although Qing Dynasty laws are

431
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,733
more liberal compared to those of the past,

432
00:28:55,733 --> 00:28:59,000
maidens who aren't selected only need to stay in the palace for a few years as palace maids,

433
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,767
then are released from the palace to get married after a certain age.

434
00:29:02,533 --> 00:29:06,633
But the most precious

435
00:29:06,633 --> 00:29:08,867
and splendid years of a woman

436
00:29:08,867 --> 00:29:11,400
are just stolen from her, just like that.

437
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,633
This won't do!

438
00:29:12,633 --> 00:29:14,100
I cannot stand by and watch Ruoxi

439
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:15,800
end up in such a state.

440
00:29:18,933 --> 00:29:21,467
Miss Ruoxi is extraordinary.

441
00:29:21,467 --> 00:29:26,533
Pity, she was born in this era,

442
00:29:26,533 --> 00:29:28,900
and comes from such a noble background.

443
00:29:31,667 --> 00:29:33,567
What can we do

444
00:29:34,133 --> 00:29:36,767
to help her avoid this fate?

445
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,167
At least,

446
00:29:40,167 --> 00:29:43,967
prevent her from being chosen as one of the Emperor's concubines.

447
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:52,867
Perhaps

448
00:29:54,533 --> 00:29:57,567
this is a woman's destiny.

449
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,867
What?

450
00:30:36,267 --> 00:30:37,600
Bei'le

451
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:40,667
is going to Ruolan's chamber to observe shousui?
(Chinese New Year tradition for children to stay up as late as possible to wish their parents longevity)

452
00:30:43,533 --> 00:30:45,867
But every New Year's Eve

453
00:30:45,867 --> 00:30:50,733
you've always stayed up for the New Year here with me.

454
00:30:50,733 --> 00:30:54,167
Look, I have prepared everything.

455
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,567
But over at Ruolan's,

456
00:30:59,133 --> 00:31:03,200
I'm afraid it will be as cold and deserted as it usually is throughout the year.

457
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,733
It might not even have a New Year couplet hung up.

458
00:31:05,733 --> 00:31:08,267
I'm just afraid she won't serve you well

459
00:31:08,267 --> 00:31:11,867
and won't be able to help bring you fortune (in the coming year).

460
00:31:13,033 --> 00:31:14,400
Yes,

461
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,967
you've prepared everything very well,

462
00:31:16,967 --> 00:31:18,467
but I've already notified Ruolan

463
00:31:18,467 --> 00:31:20,400
that I'll be coming over to her place to stay up for the New Year tonight.

464
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:24,767
I just came to let you know.

465
00:31:24,767 --> 00:31:26,467
I'll be leaving now.

466
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,733
Nobody is allowed to slack off!

467
00:31:47,567 --> 00:31:50,600
Make sure the decorations are put in place well.

468
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:52,733
Yes!

469
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:01,467
Here. Eat some more.

470
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:05,200
Here, Ruolan.

471
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,967
Thank you, Bei'le.

472
00:32:26,667 --> 00:32:27,467
Second Miss,

473
00:32:27,467 --> 00:32:29,100
this year's New Year really is festive!

474
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,333
Let me tell you,

475
00:32:32,333 --> 00:32:35,367
Madam hasn't been this happy in a long time.

476
00:32:35,367 --> 00:32:37,200
You and Bei'le are both here.

477
00:32:39,467 --> 00:32:42,300
Qiaohui, we've already walked for so long,

478
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:43,700
I still don't know

479
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:47,167
what is the meaning of stepping on sesame stalks?

480
00:32:47,167 --> 00:32:48,900
This is called the "stepping of age."

481
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:50,567
It has an auspicious meaning.

482
00:32:50,567 --> 00:32:52,700
"Elevate in prosperity and status when the sesame flower blooms."

483
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:56,433
Jiejie, this should be enough, right?

484
00:32:56,433 --> 00:32:58,667
Can I go and see that bed of mine?

485
00:32:58,667 --> 00:32:59,867
Looking at you right now,

486
00:32:59,867 --> 00:33:01,933
it's as if you haven't seen a bed for 300 years.

487
00:33:01,933 --> 00:33:04,900
That's because Second Miss spent all her energy having fun just now.

488
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:06,100
Good that you had fun.

489
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:07,567
Let her go sleep.

490
00:33:07,567 --> 00:33:08,667
Thanks.

491
00:33:10,133 --> 00:33:12,067
You can't sleep yet.

492
00:33:12,067 --> 00:33:13,800
You have to stay up for the New Year today.

493
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,567
Stay up for the New Year?

494
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:18,700
Second Miss! Second Miss!

495
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:21,200
Second Miss, are you all right?

496
00:33:23,467 --> 00:33:24,500
What's wrong?

497
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:25,500
She's sleepy.

498
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:27,300
If you're sleepy, why don't you eat something?

499
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:28,567
If you keep eating, you won't be sleepy anymore.

500
00:33:28,567 --> 00:33:29,600
I already ate a lot just now.

501
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,300
I don't want to eat anymore.

502
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:32,267
How about we continue playing Cat's Cradle?

503
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:35,367
I... think I'll exercise a bit by myself.

504
00:33:45,567 --> 00:33:47,533
Second Miss, are you all right?

505
00:33:47,533 --> 00:33:48,833
You didn't injure yourself, did you?

506
00:33:49,267 --> 00:33:50,967
What happened?

507
00:33:51,467 --> 00:33:54,033
If you're sleepy, why don't you just rest here?

508
00:33:54,033 --> 00:33:55,433
Rest for awhile.

509
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,000
Go get a pillow.

510
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,733
Yes, Madam.

511
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:08,800
Ruolan, are you tired?

512
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,599
Why don't you take a rest, too?

513
00:34:10,599 --> 00:34:12,967
No need, thank you.

514
00:34:16,767 --> 00:34:18,267
Bei'le,

515
00:34:24,166 --> 00:34:26,633
I have a presumptuous favor to ask.

516
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:33,567
Ruoxi grew up in the barracks.

517
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:38,166
She can't compare with the young noble ladies in the capital.

518
00:34:38,166 --> 00:34:43,032
I'm very worried that after she enters the palace, she'll get into all sorts of trouble.

519
00:34:43,032 --> 00:34:47,367
So I would like to ask you to

520
00:34:47,367 --> 00:34:51,032
ask the Momos and Andas
(senior ranking maids and eunuchs in the palace)

521
00:34:51,032 --> 00:34:53,666
to take care of her.

522
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,532
That's not considered a presumptuous favor.

523
00:34:56,532 --> 00:35:00,300
Even if you didn't ask, I would've done it.

524
00:35:03,733 --> 00:35:06,900
Is there anything else you want to say? Tell me.

525
00:35:09,933 --> 00:35:14,067
If Ruoxi manages to avoid the crisis of being selected in the maiden selection,

526
00:35:14,067 --> 00:35:17,400
Imperial Father might want to decree a marriage for her.

527
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:21,233
I think, she gets along very well with Thirteenth brother.

528
00:35:21,233 --> 00:35:25,033
If Thirteenth Brother asks for help from Fourth Brother,

529
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:27,333
who knows, Crown Prince

530
00:35:27,333 --> 00:35:31,267
would help as a favor to Fourth Brother.

531
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,567
If Bei'le

532
00:35:34,567 --> 00:35:37,400
also helps to plead the case,

533
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:42,200
perhaps we can make it happen.

534
00:35:48,733 --> 00:35:49,867
Regarding an imperial betrothal,

535
00:35:49,867 --> 00:35:51,867
it's still too early to talk about it.

536
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:53,800
But don't worry,

537
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:56,800
I won't let Ruoxi suffer any grievances.

538
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,800
Thank you.

539
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,267
Jiejie has always been cold and aloof towards Eighth Prince.

540
00:36:01,267 --> 00:36:02,167
But for my sake,

541
00:36:02,167 --> 00:36:05,000
she's willing to speak gently and beg him for help.

542
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,767
But in Eighth Prince's heart,

543
00:36:06,767 --> 00:36:08,533
what exactly is he thinking of?

544
00:36:13,267 --> 00:36:14,267
Jiejie!

545
00:36:14,267 --> 00:36:16,000
The New Year has arrived!

546
00:36:16,467 --> 00:36:17,667
New Year has arrived.

547
00:36:17,667 --> 00:36:18,567
Then I'm done staying up for the New Year,

548
00:36:18,567 --> 00:36:19,933
I'm going to sleep!

549
00:36:22,633 --> 00:36:23,867
- You can continue staying up.
- Second Miss.

550
00:36:23,867 --> 00:36:25,367
Bye-bye!

551
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:29,133
I'll leave as well.

552
00:36:31,633 --> 00:36:34,100
Bei'le, it's already so late,

553
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:35,533
why don't you rest here?

554
00:36:35,533 --> 00:36:37,400
Yes.

555
00:36:43,133 --> 00:36:44,833
It's all right.

556
00:36:45,433 --> 00:36:46,633
Don't worry,

557
00:36:46,633 --> 00:36:47,700
I will do

558
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:49,000
what I promised you.

559
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:52,033
You should rest well, too.

560
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:07,400
Bed!

561
00:37:20,167 --> 00:37:21,867
Second Miss, don't got to sleep yet.

562
00:37:21,867 --> 00:37:23,233
You haven't washed up yet.

563
00:37:23,233 --> 00:37:26,167
I want to sleep. I want to sleep. I want to sleep!

564
00:37:27,867 --> 00:37:30,100
Luckily Madam stays up for New Year every year.

565
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:31,500
If Madam was like Miss,

566
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:33,467
and is only concerned about her bed,

567
00:37:33,467 --> 00:37:36,467
then who'd pray for blessings for your parents?

568
00:37:36,467 --> 00:37:38,067
Miss, don't sleep too soundly yet.

569
00:37:38,067 --> 00:37:40,200
I'll go get water for you to wash your face.

570
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,200
If children keep awake on New Year's Eve night,

571
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,533
their parents will be able to enjoy longevity.

572
00:38:13,533 --> 00:38:15,467
How could I have forgotten that?

573
00:38:16,833 --> 00:38:19,833
Dad, Mom,

574
00:38:19,833 --> 00:38:21,800
I really miss you so much.

575
00:38:22,467 --> 00:38:24,867
How can I possibly not miss you?

576
00:38:25,833 --> 00:38:28,300
If I continue staying here,

577
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:29,900
I'm afraid that I'll soon forget

578
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:32,167
who I really am.

579
00:38:39,267 --> 00:38:41,867
Dear Heavens,

580
00:38:41,867 --> 00:38:44,300
just who am I?

581
00:38:45,367 --> 00:38:49,633
Am I Ruoxi or Zhang Xiao?

582
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:16,367
Eighth Prince.

583
00:39:16,367 --> 00:39:17,867
Excused.

584
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:20,033
You were fine earlier,

585
00:39:20,033 --> 00:39:22,567
how is it, on the first day of the New Year, you became like this?

586
00:39:22,567 --> 00:39:24,700
I've made a fool of myself in front of Eighth Prince.

587
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:27,033
I was just feeling angry with myself,

588
00:39:27,033 --> 00:39:28,900
that I was unfilial and just wanted to sleep,

589
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:31,900
I actually forgot to pray for blessings for my parents.

590
00:39:33,967 --> 00:39:35,367
Showing filial piety,

591
00:39:35,367 --> 00:39:37,100
shouldn't be just spent on superficially following traditions.

592
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:39,167
Do you think that crying by yourself on the first day of the New Year

593
00:39:39,167 --> 00:39:41,300
will make you count as being filial?

594
00:39:42,433 --> 00:39:44,767
I thought that you'd committed an enormous mistake,

595
00:39:44,767 --> 00:39:46,967
to cause you to cry so sorrowfully.

596
00:39:46,967 --> 00:39:50,433
After crying, do you feel better?

597
00:39:50,867 --> 00:39:52,533
Better.

598
00:39:52,833 --> 00:39:55,433
It's time I return, too.

599
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:16,133
Eighth Prince, why aren't you staying for the night?

600
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:23,600
Your sister needs to stay up for New Year's,

601
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:24,867
and I have to prepare to enter the palace

602
00:40:24,867 --> 00:40:26,467
and pay New Year greetings to Imperial Father.

603
00:40:26,467 --> 00:40:28,400
You have to enter the palace so early in the morning?

604
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:29,833
If you need to stay up for New Year's,

605
00:40:29,833 --> 00:40:32,033
doesn't that mean that you won't be able to rest at all?

606
00:40:34,133 --> 00:40:37,200
Then Eighth Prince should rest and prepare,

607
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,233
I won't keep you back any longer.

608
00:40:39,233 --> 00:40:40,533
No hurry.

609
00:40:52,767 --> 00:40:54,233
Go then.

610
00:41:37,067 --> 00:41:42,167
Jiejie! Jiejie? Jiejie!

611
00:41:44,367 --> 00:41:46,767
I wish Jiejie a happy New Year.

612
00:41:46,767 --> 00:41:48,533
I was just wondering why you weren't here yet,

613
00:41:48,533 --> 00:41:49,533
and here you came.

614
00:41:49,533 --> 00:41:51,633
Come, come and sit.

615
00:41:51,633 --> 00:41:53,133
It's all Father and Mother's fault.

616
00:41:53,133 --> 00:41:55,367
They insisted on talking for a long time to Tenth Prince.

617
00:41:55,367 --> 00:41:57,367
I could only watch from the the side anxiously,

618
00:41:57,367 --> 00:42:00,300
but I didn't dare to spoil Mother's enthusiasm either.

619
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:01,967
This year

620
00:42:01,967 --> 00:42:04,100
is the first time Tenth Prince has gone to visit them and pay New Year greetings.

621
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:06,500
Of course, Father and Mother were happy,

622
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:07,700
that's why they talked a little longer.

623
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:09,367
Don't complain about them anymore.

624
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:12,900
A married daughter is truly like splashed water.

625
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:14,900
You're already starting to side with your husband's family.

626
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:16,467
Jiejie!

627
00:42:19,833 --> 00:42:21,133
Where's Tenth Prince?

628
00:42:21,133 --> 00:42:24,400
Didn't you say he went with you to pay New Year greetings to Father?

629
00:42:26,233 --> 00:42:29,100
He said he still had work to do,

630
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:31,633
so I let him return first.

631
00:42:38,067 --> 00:42:39,700
You...

632
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:42,467
You had Tenth Prince to accompany you into the New Year.

633
00:42:42,467 --> 00:42:45,700
Yesterday, I only had Hongwang

634
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:47,700
to accompany me to stay up for the New Year.

635
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:50,033
I didn't see Bei'le

636
00:42:50,033 --> 00:42:53,367
till dawn.

637
00:42:53,633 --> 00:42:54,733
But in the past,

638
00:42:54,733 --> 00:42:57,567
didn't Bei'le always accompany Jiejie to stay up for the New Year?

639
00:42:59,267 --> 00:43:00,900
It wasn't the same this year.

640
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:05,000
Bei'le went to Cefujin's place.

641
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,633
I heard the servants say

642
00:43:08,333 --> 00:43:10,967
that there were sounds of merriment throughout the night on that side,

643
00:43:10,967 --> 00:43:12,800
until dawn.

644
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:16,633
Only then did Bei'le go back to his room,

645
00:43:16,633 --> 00:43:20,067
change his clothes, and enter the palace to pay New Year greetings.

646
00:43:20,467 --> 00:43:22,367
That Bei'le is so...

647
00:43:22,367 --> 00:43:24,700
Not accompanying you and Hongwang on New Year's,

648
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:27,267
and going over there, what for?

649
00:43:30,567 --> 00:43:33,200
Since Ruoxi came,

650
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:36,633
Bei'le takes especially good care of them.

651
00:43:36,633 --> 00:43:38,733
Every couple of days,

652
00:43:39,333 --> 00:43:41,200
he'll go there.

653
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:42,767
Every time there's something interesting,

654
00:43:42,767 --> 00:43:45,200
he sends it there.

655
00:43:46,967 --> 00:43:49,067
This Ruoxi

656
00:43:49,067 --> 00:43:51,800
definitely isn't a simple person.

657
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:57,767
She's mature and knows how to be scheming.

658
00:43:57,767 --> 00:43:59,367
All the servants in the household,

659
00:43:59,367 --> 00:44:01,400
and those princes,

660
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:04,533
which one of them is not full of praise for her?

661
00:44:05,833 --> 00:44:07,100
Exactly.

662
00:44:07,767 --> 00:44:09,600
Actually, today, all Tenth Prince

663
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:11,567
wanted to do was come here.

664
00:44:11,567 --> 00:44:12,767
I saw him like that,

665
00:44:12,767 --> 00:44:14,867
and knew he definitely wanted to come find Ruoxi again,

666
00:44:14,867 --> 00:44:18,467
so I could only send him back home first.

667
00:44:27,733 --> 00:44:30,000
Maiden selections are coming up soon.

668
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:33,533
I hope that after she leaves Bei'le's estate,

669
00:44:34,233 --> 00:44:37,100
everything will make a turn for the better.

670
00:44:41,033 --> 00:44:44,000
But the maiden selection that Jiejie mentioned,

671
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,633
talking about that maiden selection,

672
00:44:47,867 --> 00:44:50,100
it really is troublesome.

673
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:53,667
Think about it, at the Mid-Autumn Festival, Imperial Father

674
00:44:53,667 --> 00:44:55,967
had a great impression of Ruoxi.

675
00:44:55,967 --> 00:44:57,400
If this time,

676
00:44:58,167 --> 00:45:00,767
she catches Imperial Father's eyes again,

677
00:45:00,767 --> 00:45:02,267
then won't her attitude

678
00:45:02,267 --> 00:45:04,900
be even more arrogant?

679
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:06,900
Greetings to Bei'le.

680
00:45:14,633 --> 00:45:17,033
Greetings to Bei'le.

681
00:45:17,033 --> 00:45:18,533
Rise.

682
00:45:20,833 --> 00:45:22,267
Why were you the only one to come?

683
00:45:22,267 --> 00:45:23,467
Where's Tenth Brother?

684
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:25,633
He said he still had things to do,

685
00:45:25,633 --> 00:45:28,200
so he returned home first.

686
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:30,000
Everyone says that a man starts to establish his career after settling down,

687
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,000
now that he's settled down, he finally knows how to establish his career.

688
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,667
Bei'le is joking.

689
00:45:34,667 --> 00:45:37,633
What can he have to do on the first day of the New Year.

690
00:45:37,633 --> 00:45:39,567
It's most likely that after staying up for New Year last night,

691
00:45:39,567 --> 00:45:40,733
he was tired,

692
00:45:40,733 --> 00:45:42,100
so he wanted to return back to sleep,

693
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:43,600
but was afraid of being blamed by you.

694
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:46,967
That's why he found such a dignified-sounding excuse.

695
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:22,233
Second Miss! Second Miss!

696
00:46:22,233 --> 00:46:23,967
Come quickly!

697
00:46:23,967 --> 00:46:25,700
Second Miss!

698
00:46:35,067 --> 00:46:36,767
Hurry and look!

699
00:46:37,367 --> 00:46:39,633
Second Miss, come quickly!

700
00:46:39,633 --> 00:46:41,000
Second Miss!

701
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,700
You've been moody for many days.

702
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:43,700
There's such a crowd today,

703
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:45,967
won't you be a little happier?

704
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:48,767
Second Miss, look!

705
00:46:48,767 --> 00:46:50,400
Look at how pretty that is!

706
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:52,967
Hurry and look!

707
00:46:54,767 --> 00:46:56,467
It's so lively!
