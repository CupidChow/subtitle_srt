2
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:20,630
♫  In the blink of an eye, a thought of stubborn persistence  ♫

3
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:24,510
♫  We were destined to seek our doom like moths flying towards the flame  ♫

4
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:31,150
♫  Knowing that it’d be a disaster, why am I still at a loss about what to do  ♫

5
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:39,290
♫  The best is not to see, the best is not to miss you  ♫

6
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:43,930
♫  Only like this can I not be in love with you  ♫

7
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:48,100
♫  Just another brushing of the shoulder, and from then...♫

8
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:54,140
♫  I’ll keep falling deeper and deeper in love with you  ♫

9
00:00:55,450 --> 00:01:02,320
♫  It’s the mistake of time, ♫
♫ forcing us to pass each other by  ♫

10
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:05,490
♫  How I miss you, how far you are  ♫

11
00:01:05,490 --> 00:01:12,000
♫  Even though I’d known it’d only result in pain,  ♫
♫ at this moment, I still don’t want to escape   ♫

12
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:16,880
♫  Pity these words are too glaring, they hurt the eyes  ♫

13
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,230
♫  Two worlds later ♫

14
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:22,600
♫  Don’t want to escape  ♫

15
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:30,670
♫  It’s the mistake of time,  ♫
♫  we can only pass each other by  ♫

16
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:35,320
♫  The magnitude of me missing you is as much as how far you are   ♫

17
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:41,680
♫  Even though I know the ending is a mistake that I cannot oppose  ♫

18
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:47,000
♫  Staying in this moment  ♫

19
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:54,670
♫  We can only accept that the feelings run deep, but fate is shallow  ♫

20
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,960
Scarlet Heart
Episode 30

21
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:58,100
Come... take a walk with me.

22
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,380
Yes.

23
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,860
Who would have thought

24
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:07,740
this time it was thanks to Ruoxi asking for forgiveness

25
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:11,400
that kept you from being punished.

26
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,220
She's highly favored now

27
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:16,180
and still remembers us old friends,

28
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:19,460
it was worth knowing her.

29
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,860
She did come from our home

30
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:27,900
and received quite a bit of help from you.

31
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,720
That which is worth remembering

32
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:32,820
will still be held in the heart.

33
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,900
I would prefer that she just forgets it all.

34
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:39,480
Although I am thankful,

35
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:42,460
I hope there won't be a next time.

36
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,820
The struggles between me and 4th Brother

37
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:46,380
won't be easily dealt with like this again.

38
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:48,640
She can help this time,

39
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,580
but won't be able to help a second or third time.

40
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:58,180
I just hope she can live peacefully in the Palace

41
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:00,480
and stop being caught up

42
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,880
with us brothers

43
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:04,100
and matters of the Court.

44
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:09,680
You have been at Court so many years

45
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,160
and have already risen so high.

46
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,920
Why not just let go

47
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:17,340
and have some peace.

48
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:25,060
You have me and the children

49
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:27,579
from now on, spend more time with us.

50
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:31,220
It's better than gaining position and land.

51
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:36,220
At this point,

52
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:39,120
even if I wanted to put it all down,

53
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,920
it's not that easy now.

54
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:11,500
These past few months in Mongolia,

55
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,080
how did you fare?

56
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,840
It's not as nice as in Beijing

57
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,160
I've returned this time, to see Older Sister

58
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,660
and see 10th Prince's mother, then afterward I will return.

59
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,000
In a bit,

60
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,780
I will prepare some things for you.

61
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:27,440
You can take them on the road.

62
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,240
They are not treasures,

63
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:30,820
but they will help

64
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:33,920
you live more comfortably.

65
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:37,080
Older Sister seems to have become a different person.

66
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,820
I heard from 10th Prince that the Emperor often troubled 8th Prince.

67
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:44,980
Hasn't Older Sister thought of some solution?

68
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:49,480
I have been suffering in Mongolia with 10th Prince,

69
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:53,860
but I feel like I am suppressing an anger in my heart that I cannot express.

70
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,860
You've been married so many years now,

71
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:57,940
how can you still have this attitude.

72
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:01,820
To be able to go with 10th Prince far away from Beijing,

73
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,900
means being far away from trouble.

74
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,780
You should be happy.

75
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:08,120
There's a saying, "Winner takes all".

76
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,740
Why not let go.

77
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:13,100
But with the power 8th Prince has in the court,

78
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,600
don't you want to fight back?

79
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,620
Since the dust has already settled,

80
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:19,480
there's no reason for any more fights.

81
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:22,260
It only causes harm to many.

82
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:24,960
Being part of the Royal family,

83
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,000
I can enjoy what ordinary people

84
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,980
cannot experience like wealth.

85
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:30,900
Then, of course, we also

86
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:33,040
experience such pain that ordinary people do not have.

87
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,540
Instead of crying about it every day,

88
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:40,500
why not let it go and live happily?

89
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,420
In the end, if

90
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:48,780
our life really is about to end...

91
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:51,660
The day comes that we cannot escape

92
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:54,540
and we're faced with confinement,

93
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:58,240
then I will accompany my prince into confinement.

94
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:04,160
If it's to be beheaded, then so be it.

95
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,200
In this life,

96
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:11,200
we've fought and smiled.

97
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,800
What is there to regret?

98
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:16,360
Jie'jie said it right.

99
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,860
In this life,

100
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:21,200
we each have our own prince.

101
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,060
Just that is enough.

102
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,520
- Come, come.
- Don't run too fast

103
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,020
the ground is slippery.

104
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,500
- Give me the ball.
- Hong Li,

105
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,659
why can't you let Chen Huan have it?

106
00:07:37,659 --> 00:07:40,340
- Give it to me.
- Give me the ball!

107
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,680
- Give me the ball!
- I want the ball.

108
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,960
- Come on.
- Give me the ball!

109
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,160
10th Fujin.

110
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,260
There's some things I'd like to chat with you about.

111
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,640
I've met Ming Yue.

112
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,040
9th Brother and 10th Brother are of royal blood.

113
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:42,039
They disregarded the law and caused trouble for the people.

114
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:44,240
I will never pardon them.

115
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:54,620
[ Concerning the 10th Prince of Dun,]

116
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:56,720
[ your servant is a Bannerman in our small village.]

117
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,502
[ The country's soldiers disrupted the people,]

118
00:08:59,502 --> 00:09:02,760
[ bothered our women, and insulted our officials.]

119
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:05,100
[ He has been locked up.]

120
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:08,860
[ Chief General Xu Guo Gui reporting.]

121
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:14,400
Must you deal with them so harshly?

122
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:18,955
They've never encountered situations like those before

123
00:09:18,955 --> 00:09:21,109
They're royalty,

124
00:09:21,109 --> 00:09:23,649
yet, anyone can pick on them.

125
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,240
They obviously couldn't stand it

126
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:30,140
and weren't willing to take another's bullying.

127
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:33,712
The more you restrict them, the more they'll rebel

128
00:09:33,712 --> 00:09:35,995
and find more problems for you to deal with.

129
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:42,820
No matter how careful 8th Prince is today, it's of no use,

130
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:46,780
because his two little brothers are causing trouble,

131
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:50,200
and he's the one getting the punishment.

132
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:55,480
8th Prince has already given up the Imperial throne,

133
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,920
why are you still unable to forgive him?

134
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,960
He gave up because he had to give it up.

135
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,600
Right now, there are internal disturbances, foreign invasions and peace hasn't been attained,

136
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,040
disturbances amongst the officials in the court,

137
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,160
rampant corruption, and money making.

138
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,680
We're only within the first month of the new year

139
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:13,480
and I've already issued 11 decrees

140
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,560
and issued injunctions against various ranked court officials.

141
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:19,900
There were more than 30 officials who have lost their position due to corruption.

142
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:22,720
And most of those officials held very high titles.

143
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,300
Because of this

144
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,940
many officials are unhappy with me.

145
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:31,160
They secretly wish 8th Brother's cronies can help them in going up against me.

146
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,520
If I don't shake the mountain to shake the tiger,

147
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,840
letting those people that oppose me get together,

148
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,800
the Qing dynasty, itself, might be in danger.

149
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:40,600
Maybe what you're saying makes sense,

150
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:44,480
but isn't it really to make your enemies show their moves first?

151
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:53,080
Think of 13th Brother.

152
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:56,660
He was imprisoned for 10 years,

153
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:58,720
the best years of his life.

154
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,760
If it wasn't for his problems,

155
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,240
your body wouldn't be like this.

156
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:15,720
Even the Royal physician said

157
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:18,480
he can guarantee you only 10 yrs without problems.

158
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,980
Do you know how scared I am?

159
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:27,240
The root of everything

160
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,320
was all the doing of 8th Brother and his group.

161
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:34,960
These problems are just a matter of perspective,

162
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:37,200
it's not their fault.

163
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,320
I don't blame them.

164
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,360
13th Prince would not really hold a grudge either.

165
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:46,880
Since each of us doesn't really fuss about it,

166
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,680
can you not make a big deal out of it?

167
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:54,180
No, i don't want you to worry.

168
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:56,820
But they are trying so hard to bring you into this.

169
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:58,400
You treasure them,

170
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:01,600
but did 10th's wife even bother about your health?

171
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,000
I can let you avoid them,

172
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,920
but the palace is so big, she can still find you!

173
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,400
Will you still think its just coincidence?

174
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:19,080
Maybe they have no other way.

175
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:25,240
What happens in the Court is unpredictable.

176
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:30,160
I can only promise you that I won't take their lives.

177
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,600
Thankyou.

178
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,000
Auntie is here.

179
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:10,920
Hurry,

180
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,420
go tell them she's here.

181
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:28,320
Auntie's here, hurry.

182
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:31,260
Hurry up.

183
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:33,400
Greetings, Gugu

184
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,480
No need for the greetings, stand up.

185
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,480
Yes.

186
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,160
Where is Eunuch Zhang?

187
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:54,000
He's gone out of the palace.

188
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,560
Out of the palace?

189
00:13:58,220 --> 00:13:59,600
It's raining.

190
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,200
All of you go in and rest.

191
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,000
Yes.

192
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,480
It's better not to come here in the future.

193
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:20,360
If I keep coming, I'll make them unhappy.

194
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:23,620
Eunuchs cannot be compared with palace maids.

195
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:27,040
They (eunuchs) have to stay here for life unless they commit a big wrong.

196
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:30,440
They only get let go, once they're very old.

197
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,400
Zhang Qianying has been in the palace for a long time.

198
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,400
He's not old either.

199
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:43,460
He wouldn't have been easily let out of the palace.

200
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:51,160
I should ask Wang Xi, maybe he'll know.

201
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:20,360
Sister Ruoxi.

202
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:30,120
What are you crying for?

203
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,780
I'm afraid Jie'jie has heard wrong.

204
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:34,120
No one is crying in this place.

205
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:50,600
Who are you burning incense for?

206
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:57,800
No one, I was just bored so I set up some desserts.

207
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,720
Today is... is...

208
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:10,260
the death of my family member,

209
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:14,040
These desserts

210
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:18,000
are Eunuch Li's.

211
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,440
They're all his favorite desserts.

212
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,560
What exactly happened?

213
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:30,120
Tell me honestly.

214
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:35,560
By now,

215
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:38,280
what else is there to hide?

216
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:43,500
The moment I entered the palace

217
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:46,360
I've been with Eunuch Li.

218
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,160
He treated me very well,

219
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:55,040
even until the end, he tried

220
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:59,000
to bring me back to our previous Emperor's side.

221
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,360
He's gone?

222
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,120
Yet I didn't know anything.

223
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:10,479
How can I feel at peace?

224
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:15,160
My teacher

225
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:18,900
passed this day, last year.

226
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:23,700
That's a month after His Majesty ascended the throne.

227
00:17:25,959 --> 00:17:28,580
Yu Tan told me

228
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:33,620
Eunuch Li left the palace to retire,

229
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:37,780
unless something happened once he left the palace.

230
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:43,760
Everyone thinks that my teacher retired,

231
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:49,160
but he actually committed suicide by poison,

232
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:51,920
they've already burned his body.

233
00:17:53,140 --> 00:18:00,880
Why? Why?

234
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,280
Why else, right?

235
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:09,100
How could His Majesty let him go?

236
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:14,220
I'm too naive.

237
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:18,240
Forgetting about how the mind of royals works.

238
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:26,080
Did Zhang Qianying die too?

239
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:33,260
I heard his tongue was cut out, his hands cut off, and then he got kicked out of the palace.

240
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:37,220
Wang Xi, from now we must avoid arousing suspicion

241
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:39,560
and try not to see each other.

242
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:45,080
I'll be fine, but I don't want you to be in trouble.

243
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:26,600
Pretending to sleep?

244
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,020
Resting so early.

245
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:31,920
You didn't even eat dinner, are you not feeling well?

246
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:35,260
I'll light some candles.

247
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:37,340
Don't.

248
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:43,280
You just like the dark.

249
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,800
How's your body?

250
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,680
Its better.

251
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:49,300
I ate too many pastries in the afternoon,

252
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:51,480
so I couldn't eat at dinner.

253
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:56,660
Then get up and chat with me.

254
00:19:56,660 --> 00:20:01,020
Lying down will feel bad on a full stomach.

255
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,880
I heard from Gao Wuyong,

256
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,220
that you went to the washing station in the afternoon?

257
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:09,140
Just taking a walk,

258
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:11,780
I didn't realize until I ended up there.

259
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:13,480
It was nothing,

260
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:17,360
just chatted with some people I knew.

261
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:23,160
It's best to avoid going to those places.

262
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:29,280
Recently, the war in the Northwest is very pressing,

263
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,000
so I can't spend too much time with you.

264
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,360
Eat on time, don't make me worry about you.

265
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,380
Today I didn't,

266
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:38,024
but it won't happen again.

267
00:20:39,643 --> 00:20:41,825
Then you need to take a good rest,

268
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:44,300
I still have to read reports.

269
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:56,080
I've actually learned how to reply cautiously.

270
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,724
I don't dare light the lamp

271
00:20:57,724 --> 00:21:00,720
because I'm afraid he'll see my frightened expression.

272
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,724
Back then, even though I knew he was harsh with 8th Prince,

273
00:21:03,724 --> 00:21:09,025
I thought he still loved me and wouldn't ever hurt me, but now

274
00:21:09,025 --> 00:21:11,460
I can't help but fear him

275
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:14,505
and agonize over his every word.

276
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:28,662
Imperial Father, I have a suggestion,

277
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:30,644
I don't know if I should say it or not.

278
00:21:32,257 --> 00:21:33,674
Say it.

279
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:37,067
Now that everything is settled,

280
00:21:37,067 --> 00:21:39,622
Imperial Father should revive 8th Prince's position

281
00:21:39,622 --> 00:21:44,567
and allow Bei'le and your Prince brothers to return to discuss affairs of the government with you.

282
00:21:44,567 --> 00:21:48,940
8th Prince returned to politics, continue.

283
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:50,660
Our great Qing Dynasty has expanded greatly,

284
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:53,040
this leads to a lot more frequent use of soldiers and an increase in military emergencies.

285
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:55,797
It will be very important and useful if your Prince Brothers can come together and discuss

286
00:21:55,797 --> 00:21:59,580
internal disturbances and the foreign invasions occurring right now, so why not restore the old group.

287
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:00,650
Together with 8th Prince and the others,

288
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:04,520
allowing them to help you rule our Qing dynasty, the world that belongs to Aisin Gioro.

289
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:07,740
Who told you to say that?

290
00:22:08,989 --> 00:22:11,531
That is my own idea, my own suggestion.

291
00:22:11,531 --> 00:22:14,300
It's to help our great Qing Dynast--

292
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:16,200
Who wanted you to say that?!

293
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,517
I...

294
00:22:17,517 --> 00:22:19,051
Say it!

295
00:22:19,051 --> 00:22:20,980
The 9th Prince said it.

296
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:22,840
You have been deluded by the 8th Prince's gang!

297
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:23,766
Imperial Father...

298
00:22:23,766 --> 00:22:26,160
This country belongs to everybody.

299
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:28,720
Back then, 8th Imperial Uncle worked very hard for the Qing Dynasty.

300
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,440
He deserves special honors.

301
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:33,506
I also want 8th Imperial Uncle to assist in governing the country.

302
00:22:33,506 --> 00:22:34,900
Get out.

303
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,460
Get out and go see your uncle, 8th Prince.

304
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:40,744
I don't have an unfilial son like you.

305
00:22:40,744 --> 00:22:42,214
Get out!

306
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:53,415
I tried to tell Imperial Father to revive the 8th Prince and allow him to assist him,

307
00:22:53,415 --> 00:22:54,720
out of the goodness of my heart,

308
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,119
but I ended up getting yelled at by Imperial Father.

309
00:22:57,119 --> 00:23:00,100
He doesn't believe in his blood brothers and would rather trust others outside the family.

310
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:03,846
Third Prince. There are people watching and listening here. You should leave first.

311
00:23:03,846 --> 00:23:04,969
Alright.

312
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,538
Older Sister, you are here

313
00:23:08,538 --> 00:23:12,260
Yu Tan, what did you and Third Prince talk about?

314
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:14,880
I just happened to bump into Third Prince.

315
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,980
He said he made the Emperor angry and felt bad about it.

316
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:18,987
I just said a few comforting phases.

317
00:23:18,987 --> 00:23:21,080
The Emperor's mood is not that well these days.

318
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:23,420
He must feel wronged.

319
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:25,481
Older Sister, I'll go back to work now.

320
00:23:49,266 --> 00:23:51,120
Nian Fei Niang Niang has come.
(Nian 4th Class Imperial Concubine)

321
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:54,776
Have her enter.

322
00:24:07,958 --> 00:24:09,560
Greetings, Emperor.

323
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:10,923
Rise.

324
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:13,780
Come here.

325
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:22,080
Your Majesty,

326
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,600
you've finally remembered me.

327
00:24:25,342 --> 00:24:29,420
I've been busy with the Northwest issue and neglected you.

328
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:31,467
Don't worry, Your Majesty.

329
00:24:31,467 --> 00:24:32,680
With my brother here,

330
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:35,141
the issue in Northwest should be taken care of soon.

331
00:24:36,052 --> 00:24:37,800
Tell Nian Geng Yao,

332
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:40,160
as long as he can keep fighting this war

333
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,780
and if he can repel our enemies,

334
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:43,880
expand our borders,

335
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:46,340
I will definitely promote him to Officer of the First Grade.

336
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:48,740
Even if there isn't a reward,

337
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:52,540
my brother will still do his best to win this war for Your Majesty

338
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,320
This Nian Geng Yao

339
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:13,280
really is a fierce warrior.

340
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,699
Up to the last battle,

341
00:25:14,699 --> 00:25:16,800
he had the generals split up

342
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,546
and attack the rebel's weakest points.

343
00:25:18,546 --> 00:25:19,980
His talent in managing the troops

344
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:23,760
gave the enemy no way to fight back.

345
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:27,665
He ended this battle with a huge victory.

346
00:25:27,665 --> 00:25:29,288
Many officials in the Court

347
00:25:29,288 --> 00:25:31,880
also praised Nian Geng Yao, saying that he fought well.

348
00:25:32,962 --> 00:25:34,343
I have decided,

349
00:25:34,343 --> 00:25:36,660
to crown Nian Gengyao as 1st rank official,

350
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:40,680
Also give him the title of rank, Duke of the First Class, to be inherited by his son.

351
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,600
His father Nian'xia'lin,

352
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,921
will be awarded the title of Officer of the First Class

353
00:25:44,921 --> 00:25:46,712
and also award the title, Teacher of the Crown Prince.

354
00:25:46,712 --> 00:25:48,740
With the accomplishments he achieved this time,

355
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:52,023
the Nian clan deserves these titles and rewards.

356
00:25:53,071 --> 00:25:56,100
13th Brother, about this matter,

357
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:58,067
I do not want others to know yet.

358
00:25:58,067 --> 00:25:59,855
I want to give him a surprise.

359
00:25:59,855 --> 00:26:01,450
I understand.

360
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,402
Are you hungry?

361
00:26:18,384 --> 00:26:21,883
14th had also fought a battle there before

362
00:26:21,883 --> 00:26:25,780
and with all the soldiers already assembled there.

363
00:26:26,658 --> 00:26:29,228
As long as Nian Geng Yao used his wits,

364
00:26:29,228 --> 00:26:31,829
he would have won either way.

365
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:43,199
Aunt, Aunt!

366
00:26:43,199 --> 00:26:44,780
What's wrong? Why the rush?

367
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:47,007
Aunt, they are steaming someone.

368
00:26:47,007 --> 00:26:49,158
Who are they making fun of?

369
00:26:49,158 --> 00:26:50,612
They didn't tell me,

370
00:26:50,612 --> 00:26:52,360
but I overheard that

371
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,640
Imperial Uncle has ordered

372
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:56,937
that every servant in the palace must go and watch.

373
00:26:57,594 --> 00:26:59,677
Aunt, how do you steam someone?

374
00:26:59,677 --> 00:27:03,842
Is it like the time you showed me how they steam a bun in the kitchen?

375
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:07,800
What did you say? Steam someone?

376
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,717
Yes, steaming someone.

377
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:15,180
What else did you hear? Who is it?

378
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:17,695
I've only heard this much. I don't know anything else.

379
00:27:18,447 --> 00:27:19,917
Wang Xi!

380
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,240
Aunt.

381
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:23,320
Don't go anywhere. Just wait here!

382
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,144
Why does Aunt not want me to go?

383
00:27:28,144 --> 00:27:30,313
And why is she in such a hurry?

384
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:35,366
Lady, where are you going?

385
00:27:35,366 --> 00:27:37,340
I saw Princess Cheng Huan coming here.

386
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:38,980
Why is Lady not with her?

387
00:27:39,183 --> 00:27:40,119
My Lady!

388
00:27:40,119 --> 00:27:41,101
Stupid servant!

389
00:27:41,101 --> 00:27:42,320
You dare to stop even me!

390
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,678
How many heads do you think you have?

391
00:27:43,678 --> 00:27:45,880
Lady, listen to me

392
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,145
Please go back, My Lady.

393
00:27:47,145 --> 00:27:49,800
If His Majesty finds out, I will lose my life!

394
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,280
Lady.

395
00:28:18,648 --> 00:28:20,491
Wang Xi.

396
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:34,021
Let me accompany you back, My Lady.

397
00:28:36,339 --> 00:28:41,560
Who is it? Who is it?

398
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:44,245
I'm already here, do you still want me to go over and ask myself?

399
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,360
Please don't give me trouble!

400
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:50,720
If the Emperor finds out, I won't even have a place to bury my dead body!

401
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:56,544
My Lady. Lady. Lady!

402
00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:59,733
It's Yu Tan!

403
00:29:11,207 --> 00:29:13,656
Yu Tan...

404
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:22,888
Lady! Lady!

405
00:29:31,017 --> 00:29:37,126
Yu Tan... Yu Tan... Yu Tan.

406
00:29:38,088 --> 00:29:39,060
Get away!

407
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:41,000
Why have you done this?

408
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,440
I have a reason for what I did.

409
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:45,330
Get better first, then I'll give you an explanation, alright?

410
00:29:45,330 --> 00:29:46,519
She was my sister...

411
00:29:46,519 --> 00:29:48,700
She was my sister!

412
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:51,535
You think she was your sister, but she didn't think of you as hers!

413
00:29:51,535 --> 00:29:53,160
It's not that I didn't give her a chance.

414
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:55,516
Go away, I don't want to see you!

415
00:29:55,516 --> 00:29:56,947
Go away!

416
00:30:00,521 --> 00:30:02,060
Don't be so agitated.

417
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:04,205
You're pregnant.

418
00:30:07,024 --> 00:30:09,180
The Imperial Physician's confirmed it.

419
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:10,980
It's been 2 months now.

420
00:30:22,317 --> 00:30:24,307
I hate you.

421
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:35,020
If you want me to leave...

422
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:38,346
then I will leave right now.

423
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:43,640
But please take care of yourself

424
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,058
and the child.

425
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:05,522
Mei Xiang, Ju Yue.

426
00:31:05,522 --> 00:31:06,760
- Yes.
- Yes.

427
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:08,084
Take care of your master.

428
00:31:08,084 --> 00:31:09,180
- Yes.
- Yes.

429
00:31:28,635 --> 00:31:31,920
Your Majesty, Lady Ruoxi 's health is already poor

430
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,595
Adding to that, this recent blow

431
00:31:33,595 --> 00:31:35,320
it's affecting the baby.

432
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:37,120
I will look for every solution possible

433
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:40,222
to ensure the safety of both mother and child.

434
00:31:40,222 --> 00:31:45,716
That is, heartsickness is hard to cure.

435
00:31:45,716 --> 00:31:50,892
I just need you to use everything you have to save Ruoxi, make sure nothing happens to her.

436
00:31:50,892 --> 00:31:54,380
I will take care of the rest.

437
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:56,460
I will.

438
00:31:56,954 --> 00:31:58,360
You may leave.

439
00:31:58,360 --> 00:31:59,380
Yes.

440
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,780
Greetings, Your Majesty

441
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:15,020
Excused.

442
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:16,499
Thank you, Your Majesty.

443
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:25,452
What is Your Majesty worrying about?

444
00:32:26,867 --> 00:32:28,700
Ruoxi is pregnant.

445
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:30,700
She is?!

446
00:32:35,709 --> 00:32:39,601
Then Imperial Brother should be very happy.

447
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:42,442
She doesn't want to see me.

448
00:32:45,523 --> 00:32:51,960
I had Yu Tan steamed to death in front of everyone as a warning,

449
00:32:52,457 --> 00:32:55,880
but she still saw it with her own eyes.

450
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:58,420
She now has a fever and it won't go away

451
00:32:58,420 --> 00:33:00,322
and it is also affecting the baby.

452
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:05,620
But hadn't you already given her a warning once before?

453
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:07,260
What did she do

454
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:09,401
that's making you suffer?

455
00:33:14,223 --> 00:33:17,388
9th was inciting Hong Shi, to fight for the Crown Prince's position,

456
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:22,320
and also ordered Yu Tan to use the relationship between 8th, 10th, and 14th

457
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:26,960
to spoil the relationship between Ruoxi and me.

458
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:31,760
If I did not do anything to stop it, they were just going to get bolder and bolder.

459
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:35,080
Ruoxi has been in the palace for so many years,

460
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:38,224
she should know by now,

461
00:33:38,224 --> 00:33:42,180
there are some conflicts that cannot be prevented.

462
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:43,579
But,

463
00:33:43,579 --> 00:33:45,720
she is someone who values relationships.

464
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:48,864
She won't be able to accept this suddenly all at once.

465
00:33:48,864 --> 00:33:50,560
As of now,

466
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:53,960
I will find a chance to explain to her.

467
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:56,240
I'm afraid that once she understands,

468
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,320
she will still hate me.

469
00:34:04,097 --> 00:34:05,523
You can go.

470
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:08,100
Yes.

471
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:48,700
With Heaven as our witness,

472
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:51,159
from today onward,

473
00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:53,360
we will be as close as real sisters,

474
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:58,017
to love, respect, and protect each other.

475
00:35:13,467 --> 00:35:16,240
When the previous servant was sentenced to death,

476
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:19,107
I promised you myself,

477
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:21,720
that it wouldn't matter what you did wrong

478
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:24,030
I would protect you.

479
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:28,063
I thought with the love the Emperor has for me,

480
00:35:28,063 --> 00:35:32,880
I would be able to keep you safe in this palace.

481
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:38,900
But who knew he would treat you like that.

482
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:41,524
- Gu'gu!
- Gu'gu,Gu'gu!

483
00:35:41,524 --> 00:35:42,381
Call the Imperial Physician!

484
00:35:42,381 --> 00:35:45,100
- Call the Imperial Physician!
- Physician!

485
00:35:50,767 --> 00:35:52,820
Your servant greets Older Sister.

486
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:55,440
Leave.

487
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:03,040
Sit down.

488
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:06,900
I don't dare to.

489
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:13,635
What does Older Sister want me to do?

490
00:36:15,984 --> 00:36:17,868
That day, Yu Tan...

491
00:36:18,804 --> 00:36:21,780
how was she?

492
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:27,883
She went quickly. She didn't suffer too much.

493
00:36:27,883 --> 00:36:32,622
Did she say anything before she left?

494
00:36:32,622 --> 00:36:37,940
She just smiled the whole time and didn't say much

495
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,422
How are you doing?

496
00:36:41,422 --> 00:36:43,667
I am well.

497
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:49,180
Since Older Sister doesn't want anything else,

498
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:51,440
I will take my leave now.

499
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:56,485
I'm tired. Help me over there.

500
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:14,678
Rest well.

501
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:21,640
I'll excuse myself.

502
00:37:34,526 --> 00:37:37,475
[ I beg of Jie'jie to keep my family safe.]

503
00:37:37,475 --> 00:37:40,640
[ I know my time is up.]

504
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:45,184
[ I had always hoped to be able to explain everything to you myself.]

505
00:37:45,184 --> 00:37:51,337
[ But I have no chance now to clear things up and have to leave very suddenly.]

506
00:37:51,337 --> 00:37:56,960
[ Although, at this point, everything I want to say seems pointless, ]

507
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:00,061
[ I am just a foolish person.]

508
00:38:00,061 --> 00:38:03,310
But I have no regrets and no complaints.]

509
00:38:03,310 --> 00:38:05,548
[ Please don't be sad.]

510
00:38:11,008 --> 00:38:16,338
She once said she never learned to read

511
00:38:16,338 --> 00:38:20,262
and didn't know how to write.

512
00:38:20,262 --> 00:38:25,882
But with this letter, Yu Tan,

513
00:38:25,882 --> 00:38:28,880
how many other things did you hide from me?

514
00:38:31,138 --> 00:38:34,728
Lady, 13th Prince is here to see you.

515
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,465
Come in.

516
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,694
Your health is already not good

517
00:38:56,694 --> 00:38:59,463
and now you're also pregnant,

518
00:38:59,463 --> 00:39:02,420
how can you continue to ill-treat yourself?

519
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:06,213
Do you hate the Emperor so much

520
00:39:06,213 --> 00:39:08,960
that you don't even care about your child?

521
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,439
No.

522
00:39:10,439 --> 00:39:13,988
If you don't, then look after yourself.

523
00:39:13,988 --> 00:39:18,310
For one thing, it's your first pregnancy, and at your age

524
00:39:18,310 --> 00:39:20,214
it's already dangerous.

525
00:39:20,214 --> 00:39:24,626
Also, you've always been sickly and now you're affecting the baby.

526
00:39:24,626 --> 00:39:26,771
The Emperor is also very worried.

527
00:39:26,771 --> 00:39:30,211
But no one can do anything and you're not taking care of yourself.

528
00:39:30,211 --> 00:39:34,093
The Emperor was worried, that's why he did not tell you anything.

529
00:39:34,093 --> 00:39:36,320
I wanted to tell you to just look on the bright side,

530
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:40,820
but looking at you now, I might as well tell you everything.

531
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:44,980
If you still want this child, then follow the physician's instructions.

532
00:39:46,281 --> 00:39:48,560
I will do my best.

533
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:52,838
But I can't bear this heartache.

534
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:59,280
Can you teach me how to stop hurting?

535
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:05,500
Maybe, knowing the truth will let you feel better,

536
00:40:05,842 --> 00:40:07,360
but...

537
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,313
it might make you feel worse.

538
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:14,420
Tell me.

539
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:26,504
Yu Tan was the spy that 9th Brother's sent to the Emperor's side.

540
00:40:26,504 --> 00:40:30,360
She always gave him information about the Emperor.

541
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:33,800
Because of you, he was not very strict with her,

542
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:37,078
but always used various ways to warn her.

543
00:40:37,078 --> 00:40:41,173
But she didn't seem to know better.

544
00:40:41,173 --> 00:40:44,721
What angered His Majesty most this time was

545
00:40:44,721 --> 00:40:47,916
she tried to spoil the relationship between him and Hong Shi,

546
00:40:47,916 --> 00:40:48,940
creating quite a few

547
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:52,055
problems between them.

548
00:40:52,055 --> 00:40:57,180
9th brother also ordered Yu Tan to make use of the relationship you had with 8th, 10th, and 14th

549
00:40:57,180 --> 00:41:00,740
to stir things up between you and His Majesty.

550
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:03,800
These two matters angered His Majesty

551
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:06,740
and forced him to issue such a severe punishment.

552
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:09,880
It was also meant to give 9th Brother a very strong warning.

553
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:12,680
So the noble who saved Yu Tan's family that winter

554
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:16,407
was 9th Prince. In all these 20 years,

555
00:41:16,407 --> 00:41:21,480
it seems it wasn't me that had always made her so troubled.

556
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:23,280
So what exactly is the story

557
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:27,020
between 9th Prince and her?

558
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:31,360
Ruoxi, aren't you angry?

559
00:41:33,195 --> 00:41:35,474
No matter what occurred,

560
00:41:35,474 --> 00:41:38,560
our years of sisterly affection was not a pretense.

561
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:41,454
She was just caught between two people.

562
00:41:42,165 --> 00:41:43,807
As for the others,

563
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:49,160
who doesn't have helpless moments?

564
00:41:49,821 --> 00:41:51,841
If I have to blame anyone,

565
00:41:52,468 --> 00:41:54,860
I can only blame the heavens for being so cruel.

566
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:59,160
You're always so willing to forgive.

567
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:01,900
So willing to remember only the beautiful things.

568
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:06,460
The Emperor could have prevented this from happening,

569
00:42:06,764 --> 00:42:08,920
but he did nothing.

570
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:11,763
The Emperor wanted to allow Yu Tan to leave the palace.

571
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:14,880
But when Yu Tan was first posted to where she was now,

572
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:21,640
His Majesty ordered Gao Wuyong to let things be, instead of punishing those who went against the rules of Yangxin Dian.

573
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:24,740
When the previous servant was punished,

574
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:29,118
it was especially for Yu Tan to watch and serve as a warning to her.

575
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:31,680
The Emperor may have

576
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:34,240
wanted to allow her to leave the palace,

577
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:38,025
but 9th Prince didn't want to let his spy go.

578
00:42:38,025 --> 00:42:40,300
So that's why Yu Tan came to beg me,

579
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:46,640
and His Majesty wanting to leave things as they were, allowed Yu Tan to stay here.

580
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:49,820
If Yu Tan had left

581
00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:54,084
he wouldn't have known what tricks they were up to.

582
00:42:54,084 --> 00:43:01,292
Much better to leave a spy he knows, in place, to learn what to expect.

583
00:43:01,910 --> 00:43:06,400
I know whatever I say, you will not be able to accept it.

584
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:09,960
But His Majesty really wanted Yu Tan to turn over a new leaf.

585
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:12,484
He really did not want to hurt you.

586
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:15,883
Because he did not want to upset you too much,

587
00:43:15,883 --> 00:43:19,000
he tried not to hate Yu Tan as much as he did.

588
00:43:20,234 --> 00:43:22,680
Yu Tan was done in by both the Emperor

589
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:25,773
and 9th Prince.

590
00:43:25,773 --> 00:43:28,173
And I was their accomplice.

591
00:43:28,173 --> 00:43:30,449
I know you're upset because of her,

592
00:43:30,449 --> 00:43:33,800
but you cannot put the blame on yourself just like that!

593
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,718
13th Prince.

594
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:39,605
Do you know what I have been going through

595
00:43:39,605 --> 00:43:41,860
these last few days?

596
00:43:43,397 --> 00:43:46,240
How Enunch Li died,

597
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:49,785
I'm sure you already know.

598
00:43:49,785 --> 00:43:54,544
Yu Tan was just like my biological sister,

599
00:43:54,544 --> 00:43:56,409
even if she was at fault,

600
00:43:56,409 --> 00:43:59,683
why did he have to use such a cruel method?

601
00:44:00,447 --> 00:44:03,620
As well as to others who were not involved.

602
00:44:04,132 --> 00:44:09,349
Eunuch Zhang might have been at fault, but he did not deserve such a punishment!

603
00:44:10,423 --> 00:44:13,947
How much is there left that I don't know?

604
00:44:15,601 --> 00:44:18,155
In the Palace,

605
00:44:18,907 --> 00:44:21,308
all I know now is fear

606
00:44:21,917 --> 00:44:24,280
and even more fear.

607
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:28,234
You're only seeing His Majesty's strict side,

608
00:44:28,234 --> 00:44:31,500
don't you see how well he actually treats you?

609
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:33,540
According to Palace rules,

610
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:35,100
when a maid makes a grave mistake,

611
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:37,076
her family is also supposed to be killed.

612
00:44:37,076 --> 00:44:38,862
But because of you,

613
00:44:38,862 --> 00:44:40,884
he did not do anything else.

614
00:44:40,884 --> 00:44:42,207
Ruoxi,

615
00:44:42,207 --> 00:44:45,520
you cannot ignore this fact.

616
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:47,678
I want to rest now.

617
00:45:22,460 --> 00:45:27,080
Bao'bao, Mother's sorry.
(Bao - means Treasure, both for a boy or a girl)

618
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:30,800
You won't be able to see your father these days.

619
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:32,760
Being born into the Royal family,

620
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:36,354
in others' eyes, may seem like such luxury.

621
00:45:36,354 --> 00:45:40,432
But I'd rather you be the child of a commoner.

622
00:45:40,432 --> 00:45:44,500
Don't be like your father, because of a throne,

623
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:47,920
there will be endless fighting.

624
00:45:48,260 --> 00:45:50,180
This is not what I want to hear!

625
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:52,600
All I want is a proper explanation!

626
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:53,880
As a prince,

627
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:58,360
you only know how to create strife.

628
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:01,125
Don't think that I don't know what you are trying to do.

629
00:46:01,125 --> 00:46:05,040
Teaching 10th Brother to lead the Zhangs into defying an Imperial order!

630
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:07,760
Don't treat my compassion as a weakness!

631
00:46:15,380 --> 00:46:17,082
They are all blood-related brothers

632
00:46:17,082 --> 00:46:20,999
but to shame them in front of everybody, leaves them no face at all.

633
00:46:31,666 --> 00:46:33,670
Your servant greets both Princes.

634
00:46:33,670 --> 00:46:34,956
Save the trouble.

635
00:46:34,956 --> 00:46:37,820
You've already attained such status, yet you're still bowing to me.

636
00:46:37,820 --> 00:46:41,138
Won't that just be another crime I've committed?

637
00:46:43,478 --> 00:46:45,180
I have something to say

638
00:46:45,180 --> 00:46:47,140
to 9th Prince in private.

639
