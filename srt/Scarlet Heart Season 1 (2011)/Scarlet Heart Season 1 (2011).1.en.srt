00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,300
♫  In the blink of an eye,

3
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:20,300
♫  a thought of stubborn persistence  ♫

4
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:24,300
♫  We were destined to seek our doom like moths flying towards the flame  ♫

5
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:30,000
♫  Knowing that it’d be a disaster, why am I still at a loss about what to do  ♫

6
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:38,600
♫  The best is not to see, the best is not to miss you.  ♫

7
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:43,700
♫  Only like this can I not be in love with you  ♫

8
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:47,900
♫  Just another brushing of the shoulder,  ♫

9
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:53,100
♫  and from then, I’ll keep falling deeper and deeper in love with you.  ♫

10
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:58,100
♫  It’s the mistake of time,   ♫

11
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:02,300
♫  forcing us to pass each other by  ♫

12
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:05,500
♫  How I miss you, how far you are.  ♫

13
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:08,100
♫  Even if I’d known it’d only result in pain,  ♫

14
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:12,300
♫  at this moment, I still don’t want to escape.  ♫

15
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:16,900
♫  Pity these words are too glaring they hurt the eyes  ♫

16
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:22,700
♫  Two worlds later,  ♫

17
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:25,300
♫  don’t want to escape  ♫

♫  we can only pass each other by  ♫

20
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:34,800
♫  The magnitude of me missing you is as much as how far you are   ♫

21
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:41,800
♫  Even though I know the ending is a mistake that I cannot oppose  ♫

♫  Staying in this moment,  ♫

23
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:55,100

Scarlet HeartEpisode 1

25
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:20,240
What is this place? The hospital?

26
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:22,800
What hospital is this?

27
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,640
The environment is so strange.

28
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:30,560
Even the nurses' uniforms are so strange.

29
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,160
How... ?

30
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:13,480
How did this happen?

31
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:37,020
I'm dreaming.

32
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,480
I'm dreaming.

33
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,760
Once I open my eyes, everything will be all right.

34
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:47,000
Second Miss.

35
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,520
Miss, what a relief you've woken up!

36
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,620
Somebody!

37
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,820
Second Miss, you've just recovered.

38
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:56,340
Let me help you to the bed to rest.

39
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:01,320
Second Miss?! You're the one who's stupid (second)!
(Second can also mean stupid)

40
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,340
Who are you?

41
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:03,900
I...

42
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:06,320
Your servant is Qiao Hui.

43
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,900
Qiao Hui?

44
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:11,960
Where is this?

45
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:14,060
This is your room.

46
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:19,320
My room in what place?

47
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:22,740
Your room at the Eighth Bei'le's estate...
(Bei'le is a special title of a prince in the Qing Dynasty)

48
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:24,720
The Eighth Bei'le's Estate?

49
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,420
What Eighth Bei'le's Estate?

50
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:31,980
Bei'le?

51
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:33,730
Qing Dynasty!

52
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:35,500
What kind of joke is this?

53
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:38,120
Do you think that just because you're dressed like this, that whatever you say is true?

54
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,360
I'm on a gag show, aren't I?

55
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:43,080
Where's the camera?

56
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,820
Where's the camera!

57
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,100
Which channel are you from?

58
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:48,740
You can't play this kind of joke, don't you know?!

59
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:51,280
Second Miss... You...

60
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,360
What are you talking about?

61
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,520
Still pretending, are you?

62
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,240
What time is it?

63
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,580
It's barely past noon.

64
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:01,960
I'm not asking you this! I'm asking you what time it is!

65
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,680
I-I'm not lying to you.

66
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,180
It's really just past noon.

67
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:07,380
I'm asking you which year and month it is! Which year and month!

68
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:11,280
Second Miss, I don't know what time you are asking for.

69
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:20,300
Qing Dynasty, right?

70
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,240
Who's the Emperor now?

71
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:27,160
K-K-Kangxi Emperor.

72
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,380
Then who am I?

73
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:31,360
Second Miss.

74
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,080
Who's stupid? Name!

75
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:37,320
Ma-Ma-Maertai R-Ruoxi.

76
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:42,160
Ma-Ma-Maldives?

77
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,200
It's Maertai Ruoxi.

78
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,300
Madam!

79
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:49,720
Madam, Miss has woken up

80
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:53,300
but... she asked me, "Who am I?"

81
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:55,100
Do you think her head's been damaged from the fall?

82
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:57,220
Don't say such things.

83
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,120
Physician.

84
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,700
Are you all right?

85
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:09,240
Ruoxi, I'm Jie Jie.
( Jie Jie - elder sister)

86
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,360
No matter what happens, I'm here.

87
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,420
Don't be afraid.

88
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,800
Come, let me take your pulse.

89
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:43,600
Madam, from Miss' pulse,

90
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,820
since she suffered from excessive fright,

91
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:47,720
her mind is a little muddled.

92
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,820
But as long as she takes some medicine and rest,

93
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:51,160
after some time,

94
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,700
she will recover.

95
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:57,180
Thank you, Physician.

96
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:58,120
Qiao Hui.

97
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:58,660
Here.

98
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:00,480
Take the physician to write the prescription.

99
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,920
Yes.

100
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,540
This way.

101
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:11,860
Ruoxi, after taking the medicine

102
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:14,560
and resting, you'll be fine.

103
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:17,900
Don't worry too much.

104
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:29,960
Ma-er-tai Ruoxi?

105
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,640
I'm Maertai Ruolan.

106
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,640
Jie Jie?

107
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:46,720
Then, can you tell me

108
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,260
what happened?

109
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:53,120
You fell from the second story.

110
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,640
You've already been unconscious for a day and a night.

111
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,800
I fell from the second story?

112
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:00,680
But I was definitely hit by a car.

113
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,360
What is this?

114
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,380
High voltage wire!

115
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:07,040
If you don't handle it carefully, someone might get killed.

116
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:07,960
Zhang Xiao. Zhang Xiao!

117
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,100
Move faster, the lot of you.

118
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,580
Zhang Xiao!

119
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:11,900
Xiao Xiao, listen to me!

120
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:12,700
What is there to say?

121
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:14,200
I was working overtime in the office, and you were cheating on me!

122
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,580
What do you mean by 'cheating'?

123
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:16,980
Don't make it sound so bad, okay?

124
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:17,940
And don't insult people, okay?

125
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:19,480
I saw it with my own eyes!

126
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,960
I have severe near-sightedness, but I'm not blind yet!

127
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:21,840
Hey! Don't block the road!

128
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,040
Hey, what hey?!

129
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,440
You saw it as well.

130
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,040
I was only eating dinner with Mei Mei.

131
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,160
Mei Mei, you call her so intimately!

132
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,200
That's her name!

133
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,240
She's called Xiao Mei, not Mei Mei!

134
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,720
But I've always called her that!

135
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,320
Yes! She's your godsister, isn't she?

136
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,280
That's why. You know her, too.

137
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,960
I knew her even before you knew her!

138
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,360
So? What's the problem?

139
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,560
The problem is what you guys were doing!

140
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,880
What were we doing?

141
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:40,880
Did you need to hold hands while eating dinner?

142
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,080
That was her holding on to me!

143
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,000
Did you need to lend her your shoulder to lean on?

144
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,280
She was the one leaning on me!

145
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,600
So she was the one who stuck her mouth to yours, too?

146
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,320
Yes!

147
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,480
Bastard!

148
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,120
Didn't you see that she was crying?

149
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:51,960
Huang Di,
(His name, Huang Di, is a homonym of Wang [emperor] )

150
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,360
you think you're really an emperor?

151
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,600
Do you think you are in the olden times?

152
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,120
You can have multiple wives and concubines?

153
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:56,680
Let me tell you,

154
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,080
I, Zhang Xiao, will not accept this.

155
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,480
But I...
Hey!

156
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,240
If you guys want to argue, go somewhere else to argue, will you?

157
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,040
We're working,

158
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,600
and you stepped on my wire!

159
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,640
How am I stepping on your wire?

160
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,560
Get lost!

161
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,440
You're scolding me?

162
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:11,000
Serves you right that your boyfriend two-timed you!

163
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,600
You're asking for it, you know?

164
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,320
What my boyfriend does has nothing to do with you!

165
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,280
This shrew!

166
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:21,200
And you're still flailing your arms and legs around?

167
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,320
So what if I'm flailing my arms and legs around?

168
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,200
I haven't even kicked with my leg yet!

169
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,480
I'll kick with my leg now!

170
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:34,000
Xiao Xiao! Xiao Xiao!

171
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,540
How did that turn into falling from the second floor?

172
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:39,920
What in the world happened?

173
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:48,320
I understand now. The collision.

174
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,680
The violent collision

175
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,240
knocked even my brainwaves out.

176
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,880
I... have fallen through a wormhole in time.

177
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:21,720
Second Miss, Second Miss!

178
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,880
It's been ten days...

179
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:26,200
I've been the damned sister of this Eighth Prince's CeFuJin for ten days. (CeFuJin - title of nobleman's consort in the Qing Dynasty)

180
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,360
Yet I can only walk around in circles here.

181
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,760
Are you all right?

182
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,400
Thank you, Second Miss.

183
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,480
It's okay!

184
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,600
You're welcome!

185
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,320
Second Miss?

186
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,200
What are you doing?

187
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,240
I'm exercising.

188
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,200
Exercising is good, too.

189
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,640
Madam is happy that you're more energetic.

190
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,080
This sister that I've gained out of nowhere after travelling through time...

191
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,840
Putting it nicely, she's

192
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,240
gentle and virtuous.

193
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,680
Putting it bluntly,

194
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,120
she is weak and stays away from worldly affairs.

195
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,200
In a day,

196
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,680
she always spends half of it chanting Buddhist scriptures.

197
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:25,940
I fear that she, as the Eighth Prince's Consort, isn't favored.

198
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:29,680
At least, in the ten days that I've been here,

199
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,080
I've never heard of Eighth Prince coming over.

200
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:34,320
But seeing from these ten days,

201
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,600
it's true that she treats this sister of hers very well.

202
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:39,500
From food to clothes, there's no matter too big or too trivial,

203
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,120
she only fears that I don't feel comfortable.

204
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:44,540
If I can not go back,

205
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:46,160
then in this time dimension,

206
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,760
I can only depend on her.

207
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:51,060
But thinking of what becomes of Eighth Prince in future,

208
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:54,520
this isn't very dependable either.

209
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:57,600
But that is something that will only happen after a great many years.

210
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,920
For now, we can't do anything about it.

211
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,360
Are you tired, Second Miss?

212
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:08,920
I'll do it myself.

213
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,180
Although it's already past noon,

214
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:12,880
the sun is still deadly.

215
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,400
You've just recovered a little,

216
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,660
why don't we go back?

217
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:16,800
Sure!

218
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,800
I think Jie Jie should be done chanting her scriptures.

219
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,960
Let's go back then!

220
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,280
Qiao Hui, let me test you.

221
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,720
What do you want to test me on?

222
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,640
Do you remember my dad?

223
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,680
My father...

224
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,280
What does he like to eat usually?

225
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,880
Mongolian Boiled Mutton!

226
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:37,720
That's right!

227
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,960
What does he like to drink?

228
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:39,720
Kumis!

229
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,840
You have such a good memory!

230
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:41,600
What about my sister?

231
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,960
Osmanthus Jelly!

232
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:44,240
Me?

233
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,220
Water Chestnut Cake!

234
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:46,840
Amazing!

235
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:49,060
Rouxi, you really are...

236
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:50,560
You have only just recovered.

237
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,200
The sun outside is so strong.

238
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,280
Aren't you afraid of getting heatstroke?

239
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,800
I'm not that delicate.

240
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,200
Besides, after walking around outside,

241
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,400
my body actually feels a lot lighter.

242
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,800
Come.

243
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,360
Smells good!

244
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,200
It's true that you're looking better,

245
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,040
but you still should rest more.

246
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:16,880
Come.

247
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,400
These bird's nest red date cakes

248
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,080
are very nourishing.

249
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:23,520
Bird's nest?

250
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:25,520
Thank you!

251
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:33,980
You... in the past, you were like a wild horse,

252
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:36,440
you wouldn't even listen to Father.

253
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,600
But since you had a fall,

254
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,720
your temper has improved.

255
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,640
You're starting to give off the aura of a maiden.

256
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:46,880
And you're more well-behaved, too.

257
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,800
Really?

258
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,600
So your sister was like that...

259
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,360
What did you say?

260
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,680
Bird's nest cake is delicious.

261
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:58,160
What's wrong?

262
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,520
Second Miss, drink some water.

263
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:03,980
I just said that you were well-behaved,

264
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:05,720
and you're revealing your true nature again.

265
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:08,480
Really, it's not like anyone is snatching it from you.

266
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:12,640
Should I tell her,

267
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,440
that I am not her sister, Ruoxi?

268
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,280
That won't do.

269
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,960
Even if I told her, she wouldn't believe me.

270
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:20,360
She might even think I'm crazy.

271
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,760
Jie Jie,

272
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:28,080
how long have I been here?

273
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:30,120
You've forgotten all these things?

274
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:35,880
Maybe it's because I had a fall, and damaged my head,

275
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:39,560
so I don't remember a lot of things anymore.

276
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,080
You've been here for almost three months.

277
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,200
Then the maiden you mention earlier...

278
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,880
Was it because of the Maiden Selection

279
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,720
that Father sent me here?

280
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,040
Not only that.

281
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:54,560
Father said, Mother died early

282
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,520
and you wouldn't listen to his concubine.

283
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,760
The more he disciplined you, the more unruly you got.

284
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:01,920
Luckily, you were still willing to listen to me a little.

285
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,960
That's why he sent you here.

286
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:09,320
Then, how long is it before the Maiden Selections?

287
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,600
There's still half a year.

288
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:13,720
So you still have time to practice.

289
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,640
Unreliable. So unreliable.

290
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,120
This is just placing myself at risk.

291
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:25,440
And I still have to enter the palace to go through what, a Maiden Selection?

292
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,880
What a joke!

293
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,200
Do you think it's a beauty contest?

294
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:33,120
Half a year? I need to hurry up and leave.

295
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,080
In the past, the female leads in novels and movies,

296
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,720
how did they return?

297
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,320
By electric shock?

298
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,200
Where am I to find electricity?

299
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,680
Break the speed barrier?

300
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:45,880
That won't do.

301
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:49,520
What I want is for my brainwaves to return,

302
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,440
not my body.

303
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:56,960
Second Miss, don't go!

304
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:59,760
Qiao Hui! Don't you and my sister want me to recover sooner?

305
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,160
Take me to see the place I fell from.

306
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:01,840
Is there a problem with it?!

307
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:02,800
But Madam said...

308
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,560
Other than Heaven and Earth, only you and I know about it!

309
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:06,400
Where is it?

310
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,560
Here.

311
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:28,720
Miss, have you forgotten how you fell?

312
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,079
How did I fall?

313
00:17:30,079 --> 00:17:31,680
At that time , you were lying here

314
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:34,120
You fell down from these stairs.

315
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,000
You saw it happen?

316
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,040
Princess Ming Yu saw it.

317
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:43,880
She said you rolled down by yourself.

318
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,800
Is that so?

319
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:56,600
I am sure, before I fainted from the car accident,

320
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,520
that scene I saw was real.

321
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:00,360
This is so scary.

322
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:02,840
If I fall from here again,

323
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:05,920
my soul might be able to leave this body again.

324
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,520
And when I open my eyes again,

325
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,680
I'd have returned to the year 2011.

326
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,360
But is the current me,

327
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,840
dead or alive?

328
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,240
If I don't try, how will I know?

329
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:44,040
Second Miss, let's go back, shall we?

330
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,560
It's going to be mealtime soon.

331
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:49,880
I'll help you down.

332
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:12,280
Qiao Hui,

333
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:15,960
will you miss your parents?

334
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,760
Or worry that your elder brother back home

335
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,520
won't take good care of them?

336
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,320
I do.

337
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:23,240
But my younger siblings are at home.

338
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,960
They will take good care of my parents.

339
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,680
I wonder if the sky that they see,

340
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,660
is the same?

341
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,040
Sky?

342
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,360
What's so different about the sky?

343
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,360
We can't predict what will happen in the future

344
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,120
The most heartbreaking is

345
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:44,160
when parents have to bury their children.

346
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,540
This little girl is interesting!

347
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:49,320
When she talks,

348
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,800
she doesn't sound like a little girl at all.

349
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,860
Exactly! At such a young age,

350
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:54,760
you sound as if you've experienced a lot of things.

351
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:57,000
There's a unique sophistication to the way she speaks.

352
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,160
What's the meaning of this?

353
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:02,500
Long Live Ninth Prince. Long Live Tenth Prince.

354
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:07,000
Long Live Ninth Prince. Long Live Tenth Prince.

355
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,200
What kind of bow is this? Rise.

356
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:13,100
Are you from the Maertai family as well?

357
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,640
Tenth Brother, let's go.

358
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,680
Eighth Brother's almost back.

359
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,280
We still have a lot of things to settle.

360
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:21,820
Right! See, the moment I see something interesting,

361
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:22,980
I forget that there's important matters to do.

362
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:25,000
Ninth Brother, wait for me!

363
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:25,920
Who'd have thought

364
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,440
that although I've come to Eighth Prince's Estate,

365
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,820
the first person I meet is not the Eighth Prince,

366
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:32,040
but the ones who are known in history as Sharp-Tongued Ninth

367
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,880
and Idiot Tenth.

368
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,440
He really does resemble an idiot a little.

369
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,380
I'll take my leave.

370
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:45,480
Please!

371
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,080
Second Miss!

372
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:57,400
Let's just walk around for a little while, can we?

373
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,240
Second Miss!

374
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,880
Second Miss, I think that as you get better,

375
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,560
you're getting more and more daring.

376
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:08,160
You want to go here, and you want to go there...

377
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:11,440
Qiao Hui, if I stay still any longer, there's going to be grass growing on me!

378
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,840
Grass can grow on people, too?

379
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,340
Don't you feel

380
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:17,040
that I have grass all over me now?

381
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:21,120
Second Miss, it's getting harder and harder for me to understand what you're saying.

382
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,320
- Second Miss!
- Take a look!

383
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:24,520
Everyone come and take a look!

384
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,040
How about buying one?

385
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,240
This and this and this are good!

386
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,120
Come.

387
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:30,740
What is this?

388
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:32,280
it is an iron

389
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,980
This is an iron ?

390
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:36,020
In the past, when Second Miss was hard to please,

391
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:37,800
a few of us maids privately discussed among ourselves

392
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,440
that we should look for a huge iron

393
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:42,080
so as to iron your insides obedient.

394
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,360
Yes, yes, yes, why don't you buy one?

395
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:46,160
I used to be very hard to please?

396
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:49,420
We were just joking.

397
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,160
I think so, too.

398
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,520
Is this the capital's CBD (Central Business District)?

399
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:57,960
What 'di' place is Second Miss talking about?
(D is a homonym of "di", which means place)

400
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,480
The most prosperous and bustling place! The biggest!

401
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,280
Yes. This is Dashilan.

402
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:04,060
Dashilan?

403
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,840
I used to come here often.

404
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:10,260
Who'd have thought that it's kept the look of olden time Beijing.

405
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:11,680
Second Miss,

406
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,480
you've been in the capital for three months,

407
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:15,342
and this is the first time you've left the Bei'le's Estate.

408
00:22:15,342 --> 00:22:16,680
How could you have come here often?

409
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:17,320
Besides,

410
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:20,300
how would you know about olden time Beijing?

411
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:21,920
All these were things I heard about!

412
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:24,360
Move away, Move away, Move away.

413
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:28,160
Move away! Faster! Go, go, go!

414
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:36,840
Second Miss, hurry let's stand aside.

415
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:41,720
Move aside! Move aside! Hurry and move aside!

416
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,320
Qiao Hui, what are they doing?

417
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:48,200
You don't know?

418
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:50,660
I heard that the Emperor is returning to Beijing.

419
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:52,380
They are here to welcome the Emperor.

420
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:53,520
The Emperor?

421
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,400
Yes.

422
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,260
You are so fierce

423
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:07,000
Serve you right as your boyfriend is a two timer

424
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,560
That who! Wait up!

425
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:16,229
- Second Miss!
- Wait up!

426
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:18,361
Second Miss!

427
00:23:18,361 --> 00:23:19,013
Please Give way

428
00:23:19,013 --> 00:23:20,600
- Sorry!
- Second Miss!

429
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:26,360
Move aside!

430
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,200
Worker, Where is Huang Di ?

431
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,720
How dare you ! What are you saying

432
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,720
I ask you where is Huang di !

433
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,220
Your servant deserves to die.

434
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,640
Second Miss, are you all right?

435
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,300
Fourth Prince, spare us!

436
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:11,960
We're from Eighth Bei'le's Estate.

437
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:15,400
Fourth Prince!

438
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:29,640
Yong Zheng

439
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:36,380
Second Miss!

440
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:38,160
Second Miss , you are finally back !

441
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:40,320
Dong Yu , Don't be so loud

442
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,740
What If my sister knows that i went out

443
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:43,960
Your servant deserve to die

444
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:46,840
However , your sister already knew about it

445
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:48,640
Didn't i asked you to say that i was in the room resting ?

446
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,700
How did my sister know?

447
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:50,180
I...

448
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:54,440
Dongyu, what is going on?

449
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,320
Because...

450
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:56,860
Because Second miss secretly went out

451
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:58,680
hence they are given 20 strokes of cane

452
00:24:58,680 --> 00:24:59,400
My god!

453
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:02,680
Second Miss! Second Miss! Second Miss!

454
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:04,600
Second Miss! Second Miss!

455
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,480
Stop hitting! Stop hitting! Halt!

456
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:09,540
Second Miss, don't intervene anymore;

457
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:10,840
If not you might also be dragged to do the punshiments

458
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,640
What right do they have! They're beating them to death!

459
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,600
That is so cruel

460
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,240
- Halt!
- Second Miss! Second Miss!

461
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,340
They won't stop.

462
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:17,480
They only listen to their mistress.

463
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:25,180
Second Miss! Second Miss! Second Miss!

464
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:26,158
Don't run.

465
00:25:26,158 --> 00:25:28,080
Don't run, Second Miss.

466
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,320
Second Miss!

467
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:35,528
Jie Jie,

468
00:25:35,528 --> 00:25:36,840
Can you don't hit the servants?

469
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,175
Aren't you benevolent?

470
00:25:38,175 --> 00:25:39,340
Why did you punish them so heavily ? Ruoxi,

471
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:40,600
you're not to be impolite.

472
00:25:41,628 --> 00:25:42,880
Hurry and greet DiFuJin.
(DiFuJin - Major wife of a nobleman)

473
00:25:50,525 --> 00:25:52,186
Ruoxi greets DiFuJin.

474
00:25:52,186 --> 00:25:53,347
Madam.

475
00:25:58,710 --> 00:26:03,220
What did you just say? So cruel?

476
00:26:04,097 --> 00:26:05,220
I was only...

477
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:08,700
only trying to save those innocent servants.

478
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:13,940
Those innocent servants were punished by my orders.

479
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:16,265
That's why,

480
00:26:16,265 --> 00:26:19,380
your sister's heart is still as benevolent as that of Buddha,

481
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:22,116
and my heart is as venomous as a snake.

482
00:26:22,749 --> 00:26:24,100
Isn't that so?

483
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:27,178
Ruoxi didn't mean to offend,

484
00:26:27,178 --> 00:26:30,057
I will apologize to you in her place.

485
00:26:30,057 --> 00:26:32,147
Please forgive her.

486
00:26:37,459 --> 00:26:39,113
You sisters,

487
00:26:39,113 --> 00:26:41,900
only look somewhat similar,

488
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:45,460
your personalities are completely different.

489
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:50,380
One is solitary and aloof, the other is unruly and wild.

490
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:56,380
You must know that this estate has its rules.

491
00:26:57,155 --> 00:26:59,245
If a servant neglects her job,

492
00:26:59,245 --> 00:27:01,980
she must be punished.

493
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:04,564
Therefore, if a mistress makes a blunder,

494
00:27:04,564 --> 00:27:06,582
she will also have to be punished.

495
00:27:06,582 --> 00:27:08,860
And the punishment must be even more severe.

496
00:27:09,601 --> 00:27:12,930
Girl, you can fool your sister,

497
00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:14,477
but you can not fool me.

498
00:27:14,477 --> 00:27:16,335
You left the estate on your own,

499
00:27:16,335 --> 00:27:18,239
and you still dare to argue with me?

500
00:27:18,239 --> 00:27:21,820
Do you know what kind of punishment you should receive?

501
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:28,488
Please forgive Ruoxi.

502
00:27:28,488 --> 00:27:29,942
Ruoxi is still young,

503
00:27:29,942 --> 00:27:32,340
and she just arrived here and doesn't know the rules.

504
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:33,496
Then why don't you say

505
00:27:33,496 --> 00:27:36,350
that it's your fault as a sister not to have done a good job in disciplining her.

506
00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:38,301
Yes, it's my fault.

507
00:27:38,301 --> 00:27:39,765
I am willing to be punished.

508
00:27:39,765 --> 00:27:43,548
You should be punished, as CeFuJin, you should be punished more severely than anyone.

509
00:27:43,548 --> 00:27:45,545
No. I should take responsibility for my actions

510
00:27:45,545 --> 00:27:46,939
Your logic doesn't make sense.

511
00:27:46,939 --> 00:27:48,796
If Jie Jie has to be responsible for the mistake I committed,

512
00:27:48,796 --> 00:27:51,820
then following this line of logic, DiFuJin must also be responsible for the mistake Jie Jie committed.

513
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:53,951
As the DiFuJin, and the matriarch of the household,

514
00:27:53,951 --> 00:27:55,809
then don't you have to be punished the most severely?

515
00:27:55,809 --> 00:27:57,991
How dare you!

516
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:01,060
Don't! Don't!

517
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:01,892
Let go!

518
00:28:01,892 --> 00:28:03,060
Jie Jie!

519
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:07,340
- Jie Jie.
- Today, I must teach you a lesson.

520
00:28:09,508 --> 00:28:10,700
Stop fighting.

521
00:28:11,412 --> 00:28:14,199
Both of you stop fighting! Stop fighting!

522
00:28:14,199 --> 00:28:15,240
Stop fighting!

523
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,128
Stop fighting, Madam. Stop fighting.

524
00:28:16,128 --> 00:28:17,940
- Let go!
- Madam!

525
00:28:20,306 --> 00:28:21,174
Madam! Madam!

526
00:28:21,174 --> 00:28:21,917
Jie Jie.

527
00:28:21,917 --> 00:28:23,496
Are you all right? Madam! Madam!

528
00:28:23,496 --> 00:28:24,750
Are you all right?

529
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:26,660
She's bleeding!

530
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:28,200
What should we do? What should we do?

531
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:31,716
What should we do? She's bleeding.

532
00:28:31,716 --> 00:28:33,527
Go get a doctor. Get a doctor!

533
00:28:33,527 --> 00:28:34,609
Hurry and summon the Imperial Physician.

534
00:28:34,609 --> 00:28:35,491
Yes.

535
00:28:35,491 --> 00:28:36,631
Hurry, help DiFuJin back to her room

536
00:28:36,631 --> 00:28:38,071
Slowly. Slowly. Madam, slowly. Be careful!

537
00:28:38,071 --> 00:28:39,346
Be careful, Madam!

538
00:28:41,482 --> 00:28:42,715
Madam, are you alright?

539
00:28:42,715 --> 00:28:43,990
Jie Jie.

540
00:28:54,325 --> 00:28:55,461
Jie Jie,

541
00:28:55,461 --> 00:28:58,108
that kick that hit you just now was pretty powerful, too.

542
00:28:58,108 --> 00:28:59,083
Do you want

543
00:28:59,083 --> 00:29:00,900
to get the Imperial Physician to take a look, too?

544
00:29:01,591 --> 00:29:05,020
It's nothing, no need to be too worried about me.

545
00:29:07,774 --> 00:29:08,464
Also,

546
00:29:09,887 --> 00:29:11,134
I've already gotten people

547
00:29:12,063 --> 00:29:14,917
to treat the servants who'd been punished.

548
00:29:15,453 --> 00:29:17,540
You don't need to feel sad for them anymore.

549
00:29:20,447 --> 00:29:23,487
Jie Jie, scold me, will you?

550
00:29:23,487 --> 00:29:24,880
It was my fault.

551
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:27,342
That whoever DiFuJin

552
00:29:27,342 --> 00:29:28,828
will definitely come to pick a quarrel again.

553
00:29:28,828 --> 00:29:30,639
Forgive your servant for being bold and saying something.

554
00:29:30,639 --> 00:29:33,736
The DiFuJin has always treated our mistress as a thorn in her side,

555
00:29:33,736 --> 00:29:35,515
she is set on not allowing our mistress to live peacefully--

556
00:29:35,515 --> 00:29:36,397
Qiao Hui.

557
00:29:39,327 --> 00:29:40,323
Jie Jie,

558
00:29:40,323 --> 00:29:41,970
why are you putting up with all this?

559
00:29:41,970 --> 00:29:43,117
A talent like you

560
00:29:43,117 --> 00:29:44,710
doesn't have to be trapped here

561
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:46,475
sharing a man with another woman.

562
00:29:47,707 --> 00:29:51,420
Ruoxi, don't say anymore.

563
00:29:58,056 --> 00:29:59,292
Honestly speaking,

564
00:29:59,292 --> 00:30:00,664
women should also have pride.

565
00:30:00,664 --> 00:30:02,482
As long as we are capable, even if we don't depend on others,

566
00:30:02,482 --> 00:30:04,076
we can also hold our own.

567
00:30:04,076 --> 00:30:05,864
So what if you never get married again for the rest of your life?

568
00:30:05,864 --> 00:30:06,792
You'd be living life happy and carefree.

569
00:30:06,792 --> 00:30:08,420
Why do you have to silently put up with her bullying?

570
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:11,140
Ruoxi...

571
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:13,355
Such treasonous words,

572
00:30:13,355 --> 00:30:15,584
how can you say them out loud?

573
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,000
Don't you know your own status?

574
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,900
Don't you know your own status?

575
00:30:19,949 --> 00:30:21,020
Second Miss,

576
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:24,114
what you just said was too...

577
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:27,565
Too modern, huh?

578
00:30:27,565 --> 00:30:30,677
Modern? What's modern?

579
00:30:30,677 --> 00:30:32,952
You probably wouldn't think this way.

580
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:41,060
Ruoxi, I understand how you feel.

581
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:42,300
You understand?

582
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:47,320
Both of us grew up in Xibei.

583
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:52,220
We're used to living life unfettered by rules and regulations.

584
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:55,500
But this is the captial,

585
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:56,820
the Prince's estate,

586
00:30:57,650 --> 00:30:59,260
we can not break the rules.

587
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:01,820
I don't want to stay here.

588
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:05,940
You still have the same lively and mischievous personality.

589
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:11,180
But seeing that you only accidentally pushed DiFuJin

590
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:13,580
because you were trying to help me just now,

591
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:15,820
I am really touched.

592
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:19,660
In short,

593
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:23,060
as long as you follow the rules and behave yourself,

594
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:26,540
and stay within your own chambers,

595
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:29,020
you can be as unrestrained as you want.

596
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:31,940
I will always dote on you.

597
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:36,900
Jie Jie, actually...

598
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:40,060
Actually this sister you see in front of you

599
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:42,380
is no longer the Ruoxi of the past.

600
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:43,860
I know.

601
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,380
You even know about this?

602
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:47,340
I knew very early on.

603
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:49,380
I know

604
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:51,860
you are more mature than before,

605
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:54,180
and know how to be more considerate of others.

606
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:58,900
Ruoxi, you've grown up.

607
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:07,860
I feel like I'm swindling other people's feelings.

608
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:11,020
What should I do to tell her?

609
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:30,580
If I'd really been hit by the horse today,

610
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:33,540
I wonder if I would really have returned to modern times.

611
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:35,820
But if that's not the case,

612
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:38,020
then isn't it that I may have to stay in Qing Dynasty forever?

613
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:40,940
This won't do.

614
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:44,140
I want to go back. I want to go back!

615
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,940
I need to find a map.

616
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:56,380
I need to find the location of the car crash.

617
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:58,080
If I'm at the same place,

618
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,260
then there I might have a chance to travel through time.

619
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:04,020
That's very logical. It should work.

620
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:05,540
It will definitely work!

621
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:12,820
Miss, how come you're awake?

622
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:14,100
Morning.

623
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:22,180
Dongyu, go tell everyone

624
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:24,220
to just make sure that everything's in order.

625
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:26,620
After all, this is just a family dinner,

626
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:28,940
there's no need to make such a big fuss.

627
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,340
Yes.

628
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:32,980
Jie Jie!

629
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:37,020
Second Miss.

630
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:40,260
Jie Jie.

631
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:40,660
Madam.

632
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:42,340
Everyone looks so busy,

633
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:43,500
is there something going on?

634
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:45,500
Nothing important.

635
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:46,700
Second Miss,

636
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:49,140
just now, Master's manservant came with a message,

637
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:50,860
saying that Master is coming over for dinner tonight.

638
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:51,900
Master?

639
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,140
Eighth Prince!

640
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:01,580
No wonder... everyone's so busy.

641
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:05,940
Qiao Hui, this is Second Miss' first time meeting the prince.

642
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:09,100
She definitely mustn't be lacking in her manners or etiquette.

643
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,180
Even though it is only a family dinner,

644
00:34:12,459 --> 00:34:17,420
you must help get her properly dressed, understand?

645
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:19,860
Don't worry, Madam. I understand.

646
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:33,140
Tonight, I will be able to meet

647
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:36,300
the historically famous "Virtuous Eighth Prince".

648
00:34:37,939 --> 00:34:39,820
I really am a little curious.

649
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:43,220
Although from history, I know

650
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:44,140
that the Eighth Prince

651
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:46,499
lost the fight in the Succession Battle of the Nine Princes.

652
00:34:46,499 --> 00:34:48,340
But this Eighth Prince

653
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:49,939
has always been the Qing Dynasty Emperor,

654
00:34:49,939 --> 00:34:51,620
Yongzheng's, arch-rival.

655
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:55,100
Someone who was able to make Yongzheng Emperor

656
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:57,140
hate so much that he was unable to eat or sleep in peace...

657
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:01,500
I reckon, he shouldn't be an ordinary person either.

658
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:03,980
Qiao Hui,

659
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:07,020
how many layers have I put on already?

660
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:08,420
Six layers only.

661
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:09,380
Six?!

662
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:11,980
Ah! I forgot one layer!

663
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:13,660
What else do I have to wear?

664
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:14,520
This!

665
00:35:15,285 --> 00:35:16,300
What is this?

666
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:17,900
Chest cover.

667
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:21,500
It's so hot, I'm dying. It's so hot, I'm dying!

668
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,680
Is it really that hot?

669
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:32,480
Jie Jie,

670
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,840
if Eighth Prince isn't here soon,

671
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,560
I'll go back and change out of this outfit.

672
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:37,400
This is like torture!

673
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,480
Just endure it a little longer.

674
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:49,000
Jie Jie... I'll go out to relieve myself.

675
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,400
Qiao Hui, accompany Second Miss.

676
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:51,880
Yes.

677
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:54,040
No! I'll go by myself.

678
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:04,640
Hot. It's so hot, I'm dying!

679
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,560
It's so hot, I'm dying! It's so hot, I'm dying!

680
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:12,080
The makeup in ancient times

681
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:13,560
isn't waterproof, is it?

682
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:18,160
What am I to do if I ruined my makeup?

683
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:27,000
Don't cry anymore.

684
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,360
You are...

685
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,960
You are Ruoxi, right?

686
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,920
To Eighth Bei'le,

687
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,440
greetings.

688
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:51,840
Excused.

689
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,800
And I thought you were crying.

690
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,360
No, no, no.

691
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:57,560
It's because I'm wearing too many layers of clothes that I'm perspiring.

692
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:03,720
Thank you, Eighth Bei'le.

693
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:09,620
I heard the other day

694
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:11,320
you fell from the second story

695
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,760
and that it was a pretty bad fall.

696
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,500
In the future, you need to be careful.

697
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:26,560
What's wrong? Aren't you going back inside?

698
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,320
- Thank you, Sister-in-law.
- Sister-in-law, you should sit as well.

699
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:44,840
All of you are already here.

700
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:48,040
Eighth Brother.

701
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,360
Eh? Why did you two come together?

702
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:52,760
Just nice, we met outside.

703
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,800
Long Live Bei'le.

704
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,360
Excused.

705
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:58,600
Thank you, Bei'le.

706
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,600
Qiao Hui, prepare to serve the food.

707
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:01,480
Yes, Madam.

708
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:02,760
Ninth Brother, Tenth Brother, have a seat.

709
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:03,600
Yes.

710
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:04,300
It's just a family dinner,

711
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:05,800
there's no need for everyone to be too restrained.

712
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:06,920
Of course, Eighth Brother.

713
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:08,760
Why would I stand on ceremony in your estate?

714
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:10,840
When have you ever stood on ceremony before?

715
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:12,240
That's true.

716
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,640
Oh, yes, on this expedition,

717
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:17,640
I also made a trip to Xibei on the way

718
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:19,200
and visited General Maertai.

719
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,760
The general's healthy and well.

720
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,120
Yes.

721
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:24,680
You've grown thinner.

722
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:26,320
Get Qiao Hui to brew some tonics

723
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,800
to help you strengthen your health.

724
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:30,480
Thank you, Bei'le.

725
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:35,080
This Eighth Prince is gentle and refined.

726
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:37,880
He's caring and considerate to both Jie Jie and me.

727
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,440
It's really hard not to develop feelings

728
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:42,320
for such a man.

729
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:45,440
But it is hard to imagine, that the him in history

730
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:48,520
was full of schemes.

731
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:19,420
What's wrong?

732
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:22,480
Tenth Brother, what's so funny about Ruoxi choking?

733
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:25,600
It's not like that.

734
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:26,680
I just thought...

735
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,680
when I choked in the past,

736
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:30,760
I didn't choke as beautifully as Ruoxi did.

737
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,880
Tenth Brother is getting better and better at giving compliments.

738
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:51,920
Second Miss.

739
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:57,080
How are you feeling?

740
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:01,400
Get me another cup.

741
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:06,200
Qiao Hui,

742
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,680
you're the maid who came over with Jie Jie when she got married.

743
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:10,120
Regarding matters to do with Jie Jie,

744
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:12,000
you should know everything, right?

745
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,160
Then how do you think

746
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:16,320
Jie Jie treats Eighth Prince?

747
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:20,400
What do you think, Second Miss?

748
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:25,240
I feel like she doesn't really care about him.

749
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:27,960
She's very serious about chanting Buddhist scriptures. On the other hand

750
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:29,600
Second Miss already has her own opinions.

751
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:31,000
Then why are you still asking me?

752
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:38,040
Then how do you think

753
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:40,440
Eighth Prince treats Jie Jie?

754
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:44,920
Second Miss,

755
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:46,440
I can only say that

756
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:50,040
Eighth Prince only comes once after a very long while,

757
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:51,040
and leaves after a short chat,

758
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,720
not staying for a long while either.

759
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:55,800
It's can't be considered good nor can it be considered bad.

760
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:57,880
Whatever it is, they've treated each other politely for about five years.

761
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:00,840
Other wives who've married later have all had children one after another.

762
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:02,820
But our lady's attitude...

763
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:04,280
you yourself have seen it.

764
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:06,360
But I think

765
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:08,880
that Jie Jie's current state is pretty good, too.

766
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:13,680
But the other people on this estate don't think this way.

767
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:16,520
Second Miss.

768
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:19,800
Aren't you going to rest, Second Miss?

769
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:21,320
I'm going to sleep.

770
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:22,640
You should hurry back and sleep, too.

771
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:23,580
Okay. Go back then, go back then.

772
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:25,280
Rest early, Second Miss.

773
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:35,160
I know about Eighth Prince's future.

774
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:37,760
If Jie Jie doesn't fall for him,

775
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:40,040
it isn't necessarily a bad thing.

776
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:45,200
Knowing the endings of these historical figures

777
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:47,160
makes me feel pretty helpless, too.

778
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:53,000
I can't even take care of my own business,

779
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,880
why am I still bothering with other people's business?

780
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:56,320
I should hurry and think about

781
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,240
how I can return.

782
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:09,160
Hot!

783
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:15,000
I want air conditioning! I want ice cream!

784
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,840
Hot!

785
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:42,360
One, return.

786
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:44,200
Two, die.

787
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:46,400
Three, become crippled.

788
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:47,960
It's worth it!

789
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:57,400
There's no horse...

790
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:05,440
Horse is coming.

791
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:39,280
This young lady, are you all right?

792
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:40,480
Were you injured?

793
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:41,760
Who asked you to rein in the horse?

794
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:47,400
How come it's you again?

795
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:51,800
This is Thirteenth Prince.

796
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:54,080
Thirteenth Prince?

797
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:57,280
Hello.

798
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:58,320
Why don't you get up first?

799
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:01,240
What's wrong?

800
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:04,640
I've sprained my ankle.

801
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:19,160
Thanks so much!

802
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:21,480
You know my Fourth Brother?

803
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:25,360
My sister is Eighth prince's CeFuJin.

804
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:27,600
You're from the Eighth Prince's estate?

805
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:29,440
You don't look like it.

806
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:32,040
Eighth Brother has always been gentle and refined.

807
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:34,680
Everyone on his estate has been trained

808
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:36,440
and don't act too differently from him.

809
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:37,840
But you...

810
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:39,720
are not only not staying in your chambers and embroidering,

811
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:42,160
you're running around in the streets in broad daylight. What are you doing roaming about?

812
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:44,920
I just came and was bored to tears.

813
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:01,600
Let's go
I'll take you back.

814
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:06,560
Thank you for saving me, Princes.

815
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:08,720
I have a favor to ask.

816
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:09,840
Say it.

817
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:12,680
News of this matter can not spread to Eighth Prince's estate,

818
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:14,480
Or else, I'll be in trouble.

819
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:21,840
Ok.
I promise you.

820
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:24,720
Thirteenth Prince really is a hero. Thanks so much.

821
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:25,960
Thank you.

822
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:30,040
Let's go.

823
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:37,680
Greetings 4th prince
Greetings 13th prince.

824
00:45:42,953 --> 00:45:44,660
Ruoxi, what happened to your leg?

825
00:45:44,660 --> 00:45:46,080
What happened?

826
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:48,160
Earlier, when I was taking a walk

827
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:49,440
I accidentally fell.

828
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:51,234
Luckily, the two princes were looking for Eighth Prince

829
00:45:51,234 --> 00:45:52,920
and took me back as well.

830
00:45:58,480 --> 00:45:59,720
Is 8th brother here?

831
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:01,840
Send someone to notify Eighth Prince.

832
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:03,160
Yes, Fu Ren.

833
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:06,062
Princes, please wait in the main hall.

834
00:46:06,062 --> 00:46:07,160
Wait.

835
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:10,440
Ruo Xi, can I have a word with you?

836
00:46:18,980 --> 00:46:22,360
13th prince, this way.

837
00:46:28,100 --> 00:46:29,440
4th prince.

838
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:31,326
You weren't just randomly running around.

839
00:46:31,326 --> 00:46:34,065
You saw our horses and purposely ran over.

840
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:36,280
You wanted to die.

841
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:37,440
I...

842
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:40,010
Why would I seek death?

843
00:46:40,010 --> 00:46:41,867
Fourth Prince is mistaken.

844
00:46:42,380 --> 00:46:43,340
That was just an accident.

845
00:46:44,180 --> 00:46:45,283
The first time was an accident.

846
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:47,372
But not this time.

847
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:50,159
Next time, if you still want to die,

848
00:46:51,060 --> 00:46:51,816
I won't pull in the reins anymore.

849
00:46:51,940 --> 00:46:53,860
I am only doing this to live!

850
00:46:57,450 --> 00:46:59,400
There are too many things I can't put down.

851
00:47:00,260 --> 00:47:01,304
Why would I want to die?

852
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:05,600
