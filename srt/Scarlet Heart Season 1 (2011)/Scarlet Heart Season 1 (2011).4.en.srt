00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:20,860
♫  In the blink of an eye, a thought of stubborn persistence  ♫

3
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:24,620
♫  We were destined to seek our doom like moths flying towards the flame  ♫

4
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:32,290
♫  Knowing that it’d be a disaster, why am I still at a loss about what to do  ♫

5
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:39,200
♫  The best is not to see, the best is not to miss you  ♫

6
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:44,500
♫  Only like this can I not be in love with you  ♫

7
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:49,000
♫  Just another brushing of the shoulder, and from then♫

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,520
♫  I’ll keep falling deeper and deeper in love with you  ♫

9
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:02,400
♫  It’s the mistake of time, forcing us to pass each other by  ♫

10
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:05,550
♫  How I miss you, how far you are  ♫

11
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:12,360
♫  If though I’d known it’d only result in pain, at this moment, I still don’t want to escape  ♫

12
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:16,900
♫  Pity these words are too glaring they hurt the eyes  ♫

13

♫  Two worlds later ♫

14
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,470
♫  Don’t want to escape  ♫

15
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:30,540
♫  It’s the mistake of time, we can only pass each other by  ♫

16
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:35,370
♫  The magnitude of me missing you is as much as how far you are   ♫

17
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:42,190
♫  Even though I know the ending is a mistake that I cannot oppose  ♫

18
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:47,120
♫  Staying in this moment  ♫

19
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:55,260
♫  We can only accept that the feelings run deep, but fate is shallow  ♫

Scarlet Heart
- Episode 4 -

21
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:05,289
Ruoxi?

22
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,900
The autumn breeze causes leaves to fall.

23
00:03:16,667 --> 00:03:18,800
They are moping and woeful.

24
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,033
They don't wish to wilt and fall to the ground.

25
00:03:23,033 --> 00:03:26,033
But in the end they cannot escape their fate.

26
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,867
Right now, because you're feeling sad, even the flowers

27
00:03:36,867 --> 00:03:38,933
and birdsong of spring make you cry and feel annoyed.

28
00:03:38,933 --> 00:03:40,567
In a few days, when you feel better,

29
00:03:40,567 --> 00:03:42,167
you won't feel this way

30
00:03:42,167 --> 00:03:44,667
or feel sad over everything you see.

31
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,367
Ruoxi,

32
00:03:46,367 --> 00:03:49,100
you really like Tenth Brother, is that right?

33
00:04:01,533 --> 00:04:06,233
That's right. I really like him.

34
00:04:06,233 --> 00:04:10,233
He is silly and carefree, genuine and blunt,

35
00:04:10,233 --> 00:04:12,400
he isn't the least bit scheming,

36
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,467
and makes me happy.

37
00:04:15,467 --> 00:04:17,733
The most important thing is

38
00:04:17,733 --> 00:04:20,200
he was sincere towards me.

39
00:04:23,266 --> 00:04:26,000
But the liking I feel towards him

40
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,800
isn't the kind you are thinking.

41
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,933
He's just my best friend.

42
00:04:31,933 --> 00:04:35,633
Then why do you feel so sad about Tenth Brother's marriage?

43
00:04:35,633 --> 00:04:36,967
Everyone is saying

44
00:04:36,967 --> 00:04:38,733
that Thirteenth Sister was so saddened by Tenth Brother's marriage

45
00:04:38,733 --> 00:04:40,867
that she's gone crazy!

46
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,967
I'm sad

47
00:04:46,967 --> 00:04:49,600
not because of his marriage,

48
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,800
but because his marriage

49
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:55,000
was forced upon him by that person!

50
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,468
It's something he doesn't want.

51
00:05:01,667 --> 00:05:02,800
Such treasonous words.

52
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,933
You're not allowed to say them in the future.

53
00:05:06,333 --> 00:05:07,967
Do you hear me?

54
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,967
Do you hear what I said?

55
00:05:10,967 --> 00:05:12,500
Eighth Brother!

56
00:05:13,367 --> 00:05:15,167
Do you hear me?!

57
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,400
Are you crazy?

58
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:34,833
"That person" you're referring to is the Great Qing's Son of Heaven!

59
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:37,467
What Eighth Brother is doing is for your own good.

60
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:43,400
You two will never understand.

61
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,667
In the society I used to live in,

62
00:05:45,667 --> 00:05:46,800
the effort that one puts in in the present

63
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,133
can determine one's future outcome.

64
00:05:49,133 --> 00:05:51,133
I definitely cannot accept how a single word by someone else

65
00:05:51,133 --> 00:05:53,867
can decide my fate for the rest of my life.

66
00:05:53,867 --> 00:05:55,967
Even if I'm in the Qing Dynasty,

67
00:05:55,967 --> 00:05:58,233
I won't accept it.

68
00:06:05,933 --> 00:06:07,633
Second Miss.

69
00:06:19,733 --> 00:06:21,467
What's wrong?

70
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:33,500
Why are you so cold?

71
00:06:33,533 --> 00:06:35,200
Pour a cup of warm tea for Second Miss.

72
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,767
Yes.

73
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:42,533
Also, go to the kitchen and prepare some ginger soup.

74
00:06:42,533 --> 00:06:44,167
Yes.

75
00:06:50,633 --> 00:06:54,467
Is it because I hit Mingyu

76
00:06:54,467 --> 00:06:56,767
that she has to marry Tenth Prince?

77
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:00,100
Or is it because...

78
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:03,067
because she's taking revenge on me,

79
00:07:03,067 --> 00:07:06,833
and that's why she's intentionally marrying him to make me angry?

80
00:07:06,833 --> 00:07:08,300
Whether you slapped her or not,

81
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:11,067
she would still have to marry Tenth Prince.

82
00:07:11,067 --> 00:07:14,500
We are all chess pieces to be manipulated by His Majesty.

83
00:07:15,567 --> 00:07:16,867
You look at the Emperor,

84
00:07:16,867 --> 00:07:19,567
and it seems like he'd happened to think of it.

85
00:07:19,567 --> 00:07:21,833
But in fact, it was just that Concubine Hui

86
00:07:21,833 --> 00:07:25,067
had managed to accurately guess His Majesty's intentions.

87
00:07:25,067 --> 00:07:27,367
She chose an appropriate time,

88
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,133
and acted out a show with His Majesty.

89
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:34,800
Ruoxi, you must remember.

90
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,500
In the Forbidden City,

91
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,067
all the prestigious positions,

92
00:07:38,067 --> 00:07:40,067
they are all bestowed by the Emperor.

93
00:07:40,767 --> 00:07:43,952
With one smile, he can give you official positions and dukedoms.

94
00:07:43,952 --> 00:07:45,367
But once he gets into a fit of temper,

95
00:07:45,367 --> 00:07:46,633
your life can be taken away,

96
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:48,900
and you can even have your entire clan exterminated.

97
00:07:49,233 --> 00:07:51,100
Even if you're his direct relation,

98
00:07:52,933 --> 00:07:54,500
you must be careful with your words and behave wisely.

99
00:07:55,633 --> 00:07:57,000
Only then can you live your life in peace.

100
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,667
Understand?

101
00:08:13,717 --> 00:08:14,983
Jiejie, don't worry.

102
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:17,217
I understand.

103
00:08:29,117 --> 00:08:31,150
Recently, Second Miss is looking more cheerful with every day.

104
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:33,817
That's right. She's no longer sighing about what falling leaves, or writing that everything is ill-fated.

105
00:08:33,817 --> 00:08:36,017
The two of you are growing bolder and bolder.

106
00:08:36,017 --> 00:08:37,583
You even dare to mock me now?

107
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:38,917
Since when?

108
00:08:38,917 --> 00:08:40,850
We're feeling happy for you.

109
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:41,749
Ruoxi!

110
00:08:43,482 --> 00:08:45,750
Greetings to Fourteenth Prince.

111
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,050
It's all right.

112
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:50,050
You may take your leave first.

113
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:51,650
Your servants take their leave.

114
00:08:55,983 --> 00:08:57,550
Is something the matter?

115
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:59,583
I want you to go and advise Tenth Brother.

116
00:09:01,217 --> 00:09:03,250
Ever since the Mid-Autumn Banquet,

117
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:05,417
Tenth Brother hasn't attended court.

118
00:09:05,417 --> 00:09:07,217
He keeps giving excuses that he's not feeling well.

119
00:09:08,017 --> 00:09:10,183
Father has asked about him many times.

120
00:09:10,183 --> 00:09:12,283
If this goes on,

121
00:09:12,283 --> 00:09:13,350
I am afraid Imperial Father

122
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:14,883
is going to send an imperial physician to see him.

123
00:09:15,617 --> 00:09:16,583
Then what do you want me to do?

124
00:09:16,583 --> 00:09:17,917
Go and see him.

125
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:20,250
Treat his heart woes.

126
00:09:34,783 --> 00:09:35,983
Come, Ruoxi.

127
00:09:36,583 --> 00:09:38,183
I won't be going in. Hurry and go in.

128
00:09:38,183 --> 00:09:40,350
I haven't thought of what I should say.

129
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:42,650
Just offer him some words of advice.

130
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:43,617
Go.

131
00:09:43,617 --> 00:09:44,650
I...

132
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:46,483
Go!

133
00:09:53,583 --> 00:09:55,217
I have already said not to bother me.

134
00:09:55,217 --> 00:09:57,383
Get out. Get lost!

135
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:03,117
You will hit someone like that.

136
00:10:17,017 --> 00:10:18,750
Are you intending to continue being drunk like this?

137
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:20,683
Do you think once you're drunk,

138
00:10:20,683 --> 00:10:22,250
you don't have to marry Lady Mingyu?

139
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:27,417
I'm feeling vexed.

140
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:32,150
About what?

141
00:10:32,883 --> 00:10:34,483
Shouldn't you know what I'm vexed about?

142
00:10:38,771 --> 00:10:40,683
One:  You don't like Lady Mingyu,

143
00:10:40,683 --> 00:10:41,983
but you have to marry her.

144
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:45,089
Two:  You have feelings for me,

145
00:10:46,417 --> 00:10:48,050
but you cannot marry me.

146
00:10:55,417 --> 00:10:57,283
Are you willing to be my Cefujin?

147
00:10:58,078 --> 00:10:59,983
Don't worry. I will treat you very well.

148
00:10:59,983 --> 00:11:01,750
- I will definitely--
- I am not willing.

149
00:11:09,817 --> 00:11:10,917
I knew that

150
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:14,417
even if I were to ask you to be my Difujin,

151
00:11:15,417 --> 00:11:16,950
you might not even have been willing to.

152
00:11:17,917 --> 00:11:19,383
But...

153
00:11:20,151 --> 00:11:21,750
I still held a thread of hope.

154
00:11:23,117 --> 00:11:24,250
Right now...

155
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:27,230
Right now, it's even more impossible.

156
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:30,090
Since you understand everything,

157
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:32,730
why don't you just make up your mind

158
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:34,110
and be sensible?

159
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:37,850
Don't make Eighth Prince and the others worry anymore,

160
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:39,650
or anger His Majesty.

161
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:45,910
I've already allowed myself to be manipulated the way Imperial Father wishes.

162
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:47,630
You mean I can't even throw a small tantrum?

163
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:52,890
If you've given in on the larger matters,

164
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:54,950
then on the small matters,

165
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:57,670
why do things that cause grief to those who care about you, and make your enemies happy?

166
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:09,750
Ruoxi, have you ever liked me?

167
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:13,650
I did.

168
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:30,850
Actually, I'm still very happy.

169
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:33,850
The truth is...

170
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:36,930
These past 2 days

171
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:39,770
I've been wanting to ask you face-to-face,

172
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:43,710
but was scared that the answer

173
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:45,730
would be something I didn't want to hear.

174
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:48,690
So I didn't dare to ask.

175
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:53,730
Since I was young,

176
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:57,110
everyone has thought I was very stupid.

177
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:01,430
I don't study hard or seek to improve myself.

178
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:04,470
But little did they know

179
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:06,430
that I had already tried my best.

180
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:09,110
No matter how hard I work,

181
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:10,590
I cannot be like Fourth Brother, Eighth Brother,

182
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:12,110
and Fourteenth Brother.

183
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:15,510
They can remember things after just reading them once.

184
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:18,310
But even after reading thrice, I still can't remember them.

185
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:21,270
They quickly understand the meaning between the lines

186
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:23,510
of what Imperial Father says.

187
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:25,490
But...

188
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:28,350
even if I crack my skull, I still can't understand it.

189
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:31,070
I'm impatient, too,

190
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:32,870
and often get into trouble due to recklessness.

191
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:38,350
Everyone laughs at me, be it openly or secretly.

192
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:41,910
Only Eighth Brother...

193
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:44,750
Only Eighth Brother looks after me, regardless of what the matter is.

194
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:47,150
He constantly advises me.

195
00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:53,810
Ruoxi,

196
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:57,470
Am I very stupid?

197
00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:00,030
You're stupid.

198
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:03,310
If you weren't stupid, how could I have bullied you?

199
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:09,170
But it's precisely because you're stupid

200
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:11,270
that I like to play with you.

201
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:15,190
Because when you're happy, you're happy;

202
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:18,310
when you're not happy, then you're not happy.

203
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:22,230
If you like something, you like it all the way;

204
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:24,910
and if you hate something, you'll just hate it.

205
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:28,070
Not like those people

206
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:30,310
who beat around the bush whenever they talk.

207
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:34,430
Their hearts are watchful, but their faces are smiling.

208
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:37,870
Which is why, in front of you,

209
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:39,910
I can laugh out loud when I'm happy, too,

210
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:41,710
and throw a tantrum when I'm not happy.

211
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:46,110
Do you know

212
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:50,450
When I'm with you, I'm very,

213
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:53,270
very happy.

214
00:14:58,670 --> 00:14:59,910
I was also very,

215
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:03,310
very happy.

216
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:34,870
Ruoxi takes her leave.

217
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:49,030
It's snowing?

218
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:49,930
Yeah.

219
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:50,910
The sun was still shining brightly yesterday,

220
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:53,310
but this morning, the moment I opened my eyes, the sky was already full of snow.

221
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:53,470
This way, Second Miss.

222
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:18,790
I can do it myself.

223
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,110
Do you like to stand a lot?

224
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:41,590
Such a charismatic man,

225
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:43,870
Virtuous Eighth Prince, as lauded by the officials.

226
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:45,790
But because of the throne,

227
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:47,790
he was hated by his own father,

228
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:51,870
stripped of his title, and died in imprisonment.

229
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:06,950
Second Miss, please.

230
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:30,650
If I don't go back soon,

231
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:32,090
Jiejie will get worried.

232
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:51,790
Li Fu.

233
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:52,610
Master.

234
00:21:54,610 --> 00:21:56,390
Send Second Miss back.

235
00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:57,650
Yes.

236
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:31,110
Feelings. No feelings.

237
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:34,670
For fun. For real.

238
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:40,150
- What the heck do you want!?
- Ruoxi.

239
00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:41,970
Coming!

240
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:45,850
Ruoxi!

241
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:47,750
Jiejie, I'm coming!

242
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:51,170
Why are you so flustered?

243
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:52,470
What's wrong?

244
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:53,570
Nothing.

245
00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:55,210
Jiejie, sit.

246
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:09,130
His Majesty bestowed a new residence to Tenth Prince.

247
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:12,230
The wedding banquet will be in three days' time.

248
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:14,470
Come that time, I'll be accompanying Bei'le there.

249
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:17,230
Do you want to go?

250
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:19,170
It's best not to complicate things.

251
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:20,950
It's better that I not go.

252
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:23,710
That's fine.

253
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:25,830
I will help you explain.

254
00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:31,970
Don't always look so distracted and uneasy.

255
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:33,350
You'll make others worry.

256
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:37,310
I'll be leaving then.

257
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:57,790
Second Miss,

258
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:04,070
aside from the major festivals and events when Madam has to pay her respects to Fujin,

259
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:05,990
she usually does not socialize.

260
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:08,210
The other side is already very unhappy.

261
00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:11,430
If Second Miss still doesn't go to Lady Mingyu's wedding to give congratulations,

262
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:14,470
I'm afraid that Madame will be blamed again.

263
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:16,090
They will say we have no manners.

264
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:03,830
What's wrong?

265
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:07,030
No matter how grand a house is

266
00:25:07,890 --> 00:25:10,170
it's still just a gilded cage.

267
00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:11,530
You promised me

268
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:14,030
that you wouldn't make a scene here today.

269
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:17,450
Jiejie, don't worry.

270
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:19,390
"Go-All-Out Thirteenth Sister"

271
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:20,910
is here to give her congratulations today,

272
00:25:20,910 --> 00:25:22,070
and to eat the food at the wedding banquet,

273
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:24,230
not to make trouble.

274
00:25:25,670 --> 00:25:26,430
Let's go.

275
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:28,590
Jiejie,

276
00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:30,830
you can head in first.

277
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:32,670
I want to take a breather outside.

278
00:25:32,670 --> 00:25:34,110
I'll go look for you in a bit.

279
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:36,990
All right then.

280
00:25:57,550 --> 00:25:58,550
Maertai Ruoxi,

281
00:26:02,030 --> 00:26:04,290
it's Tenth Brother's big day today.

282
00:26:04,290 --> 00:26:06,710
No matter what, you should at least show a smile.

283
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:08,170
Greetings to Fourth Prince.

284
00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:10,730
Rise.

285
00:26:11,518 --> 00:26:12,370
Everyone's saying

286
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:14,470
that you have gone crazy because of Tenth Brother.

287
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:16,050
But given what I understand of your personality,

288
00:26:16,050 --> 00:26:17,870
it's very unlikely that you would fall for Tenth Brother, who's forthright.

289
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:21,030
But looking at you appearing so forlorn now,

290
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:22,390
I'm beginning to think it might be the case after all.

291
00:26:24,010 --> 00:26:25,910
Are you trying to investigate what's going on,

292
00:26:25,910 --> 00:26:28,250
or are you trying to use this to taunt me?

293
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:29,910
Since we've already met,

294
00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:31,110
I might as well just ask.

295
00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:33,530
Six words:

296
00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:36,990
Make the best out of it.

297
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:38,350
Understand?

298
00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:41,230
Strong wood that doesn't bend will break.

299
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:45,390
The donkey's* head does not match the horse's mouth.
(*the idiom should be the cow's head, but she doesn't want to use cow since he previously insinuated she was one)

300
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:48,630
The idiom's wrong.

301
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:51,310
I'm not good with language.

302
00:26:53,870 --> 00:26:55,370
Think you're the only one who knows how to use idioms.

303
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:05,550
Tenth Prince, I am begging you.

304
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:07,330
Please go out, will you?

305
00:27:07,330 --> 00:27:09,390
Don't just sit here.

306
00:27:09,390 --> 00:27:10,790
Please go out, will you?

307
00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:13,810
Tenth Prince, I am begging you.

308
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:17,670
- Eighth Prince.
- Fourteenth Prince.

309
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:19,030
- What to do?
- Go prepare.

310
00:27:19,030 --> 00:27:21,270
Your master will go out in a bit.

311
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:23,310
Yes.

312
00:27:25,690 --> 00:27:26,890
What?

313
00:27:26,890 --> 00:27:29,190
It's already the eleventh hour, and you still want to hide?

314
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:33,310
Eighth Brother,

315
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:36,350
I can't take this lying down.

316
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:38,750
Even if others plead to marry Ladies from the Gorolo family,

317
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:40,750
they might not have their pleas fulfilled.

318
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:42,310
What is there for you to be unsatisfied with?

319
00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:44,010
Then how does Eighth Brother treat your Difujin?

320
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:45,250
Do you love her dearly?

321
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:46,710
- Don't you also--
- Tenth Brother.

322
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:48,030
How can you talk to Eighth Brother like that?

323
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:55,430
Minghui was the Difujin that Father bestowed on me,

324
00:27:55,430 --> 00:27:58,110
and is Heshuo Prince Consort Ming Shang's daughter.

325
00:27:58,110 --> 00:27:59,550
Just based on these two points,

326
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:00,990
the position of Eighth Prince's Fujin

327
00:28:00,990 --> 00:28:02,310
is rightfully hers.

328
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:06,030
And it can only be her for the rest of my life.

329
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:09,790
This is my answer.

330
00:28:14,670 --> 00:28:15,790
As a prince,

331
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:18,870
since you get to enjoy the privileges that normal people don't get to enjoy,

332
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:21,510
you must also make some sacrifices.

333
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:25,910
Eighth Brother.

334
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:28,670
How can a good man

335
00:28:28,670 --> 00:28:30,390
let love hold him back?

336
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:33,670
Marry a wife that can help you be successful.

337
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:35,270
Making Imperial Father happy,

338
00:28:35,270 --> 00:28:36,390
that's what's most important.

339
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:40,110
Love between men and women

340
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:43,350
is just a superfluous thing.

341
00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:45,910
It doesn't last for long.

342
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:33,890
Since you are so afraid of the cold,

343
00:29:33,890 --> 00:29:35,030
why stand out here in the wind?

344
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:39,890
Why aren't you drinking inside?

345
00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:43,130
Wasn't I the one who first asked you a question?

346
00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:46,010
Greetings to Thirteenth Prince.

347
00:29:47,050 --> 00:29:48,690
The one waiting to hear your greetings

348
00:29:48,690 --> 00:29:49,990
is inside the house.

349
00:29:57,390 --> 00:29:58,150
Rise.

350
00:30:02,810 --> 00:30:04,750
Today, you and I are both broken-hearted people.

351
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:06,950
Why don't we be each other's companion?

352
00:30:15,270 --> 00:30:16,990
What's wrong with this Thirteenth Prince today?

353
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:19,850
Two broken-hearted people?

354
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:21,270
Could it be

355
00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:22,630
he likes Lady Mingyu?

356
00:30:45,150 --> 00:30:45,830
Take a sip.

357
00:30:58,270 --> 00:30:59,390
Take another sip.

358
00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:20,190
You wait here.

359
00:31:29,170 --> 00:31:30,270
Heavens,

360
00:31:30,270 --> 00:31:32,830
in the future, I'm never provoking Mingyu again.

361
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:34,750
This Thirteenth Prince is too fearsome.

362
00:31:57,990 --> 00:31:58,950
A lighter?

363
00:32:51,110 --> 00:32:53,670
Your Imperial Father was the one who married your sweetheart to someone else,

364
00:32:53,670 --> 00:32:55,710
it's got nothing to do with me!

365
00:32:55,710 --> 00:32:57,430
Please don't torture me any longer!

366
00:32:57,430 --> 00:32:59,590
I don't want to die

367
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:01,230
by your bullying hand for no reason.

368
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:19,510
Surely not, big brother.

369
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:22,190
I can't drink as well as you can.

370
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:26,590
Madam! Master!

371
00:33:28,870 --> 00:33:30,470
Master, Madam.

372
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:33,090
I've been to Thirteenth Prince's residence to ask.

373
00:33:33,090 --> 00:33:35,210
Thirteenth Prince isn't in,

374
00:33:35,210 --> 00:33:37,070
and no one knows where he has gone.

375
00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:41,090
Send some trustworthy men

376
00:33:41,090 --> 00:33:43,110
to wait outside his residence.

377
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:44,670
Don't alarm anyone else.

378
00:33:44,670 --> 00:33:46,470
Report back the moment there is news.

379
00:33:46,470 --> 00:33:47,310
Yes.

380
00:33:54,310 --> 00:33:56,470
Although Thirteenth Brother is uninhibited

381
00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:57,950
and headstrong,

382
00:33:57,950 --> 00:34:00,890
no matter how undignified he is, he knows what he can and cannot do.

383
00:34:00,890 --> 00:34:02,290
If Ruoxi is with him,

384
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:03,250
she should be safe,

385
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:05,150
and shouldn't be in any trouble. Don't worry.

386
00:34:09,430 --> 00:34:10,830
I'll stay here tonight.

387
00:34:10,830 --> 00:34:12,550
Until Ruoxi returns,

388
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:14,270
why don't you go and rest first?

389
00:34:46,970 --> 00:34:48,670
Come. Thirteenth Prince

390
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:51,110
Let's drink to the ever-unchanging moon.

391
00:34:51,110 --> 00:34:52,310
Cheers!

392
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:01,650
Look at the moon!

393
00:35:01,650 --> 00:35:04,070
It's no different from

394
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:05,990
the one that exists 300 years later.

395
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:11,150
Do you know?

396
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:13,550
In the past,

397
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:18,230
you were nothing more than a name in a book to me.

398
00:35:19,570 --> 00:35:20,510
Who'd have thought

399
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:24,470
that I'd be able to drink with you today!

400
00:35:26,590 --> 00:35:31,230
In the past, I've also gotten drunk before.

401
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:35,710
It was at Sanlitun!
(a street name in Beijing)

402
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:42,830
When I was in school, I also secretly drank a bit.

403
00:35:42,830 --> 00:35:45,950
I drank tequila!

404
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:49,150
But...

405
00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:54,910
today, I feel very "okay" after drinking.

406
00:35:54,910 --> 00:35:55,910
"O" what?

407
00:35:58,670 --> 00:36:00,790
Okay!

408
00:36:00,790 --> 00:36:02,030
What does that mean?

409
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:07,150
No problem.

410
00:36:07,990 --> 00:36:09,910
Look at you, talking nonsense

411
00:36:09,910 --> 00:36:11,230
after drinking.

412
00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:22,990
I'm not from your era.

413
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:25,350
I am...

414
00:36:27,590 --> 00:36:29,110
from there!

415
00:36:33,110 --> 00:36:39,670
I'm from 300 years in the future.

416
00:36:45,990 --> 00:36:47,430
But it's so weird,

417
00:36:48,550 --> 00:36:51,430
how did I end up in the Qing dynasty?

418
00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:54,070
And I've even become some

419
00:36:54,070 --> 00:36:56,510
Second Miss of the Maertai family.

420
00:36:57,590 --> 00:37:00,270
And I still have to enter the palace to take part in the maiden selection.

421
00:37:05,910 --> 00:37:06,710
Tell me.

422
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:10,150
What is a modern day person like me

423
00:37:10,150 --> 00:37:12,310
doing in a maiden selection?

424
00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:25,310
All right. It's time to go back.

425
00:37:50,350 --> 00:37:52,270
Master! Madam!

426
00:37:53,950 --> 00:37:56,110
Madam, wake up quickly.

427
00:37:56,110 --> 00:37:57,390
Master! Madam!

428
00:37:58,150 --> 00:37:59,710
They're back!

429
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:02,150
Second Miss is back. She just got back.

430
00:38:07,030 --> 00:38:08,830
Go see if there's anything she needs.

431
00:38:08,830 --> 00:38:09,630
Yes.

432
00:38:12,070 --> 00:38:13,750
Be careful.

433
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:15,670
Be careful not to hurt her.

434
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:16,590
Slowly.

435
00:38:20,390 --> 00:38:21,410
Go to the kitchen

436
00:38:21,410 --> 00:38:23,030
- to see if they've finished preparing the ginger soup.
- Yes.

437
00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:27,710
Are you done?

438
00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:29,050
Yes.

439
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:34,070
Let me ask you.

440
00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:36,270
Where did you go with Thirteenth Prince yesterday?

441
00:38:37,730 --> 00:38:40,090
Why did the two of you drink so much wine?

442
00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:43,670
Tell me.

443
00:38:46,510 --> 00:38:49,130
Comfortable.

444
00:38:49,130 --> 00:38:52,510
It works.

445
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:54,870
Jiejie.

446
00:39:35,470 --> 00:39:36,630
Second Miss.

447
00:39:37,390 --> 00:39:38,710
Second Miss, wake up.

448
00:39:41,550 --> 00:39:42,910
Second Miss, wake up.

449
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:46,190
My throat's dry.

450
00:39:46,190 --> 00:39:47,630
I'll pour you a cup of water.

451
00:39:54,990 --> 00:39:56,430
Second Miss, here's your water.

452
00:39:57,230 --> 00:39:59,390
What's the time now?

453
00:39:59,390 --> 00:40:01,230
It's already evening.

454
00:40:01,230 --> 00:40:02,750
You've already slept for a day.

455
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:08,970
My head hurts.

456
00:40:08,970 --> 00:40:11,850
Second Miss, you drank so much wine, how can your head not hurt?

457
00:40:11,850 --> 00:40:13,590
I drank too big*.
(modern slang for too much)

458
00:40:13,590 --> 00:40:14,750
What's too big?

459
00:40:16,350 --> 00:40:18,490
I drank too big.

460
00:40:18,490 --> 00:40:19,350
You--

461
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:20,790
Second Miss,

462
00:40:21,910 --> 00:40:24,830
why don't you wash up and eat with Madam?

463
00:40:24,830 --> 00:40:26,870
She's been worrying about you for the whole day.

464
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:29,990
- All right?
- All right.

465
00:40:31,110 --> 00:40:32,590
Second Miss!

466
00:40:32,590 --> 00:40:34,690
It's true that I was broken-hearted, and that I was sad,

467
00:40:34,690 --> 00:40:36,210
but not in the way you guys think!

468
00:40:36,210 --> 00:40:37,130
Ruoxi...

469
00:40:37,130 --> 00:40:38,910
Jiejie, I understand!

470
00:40:38,910 --> 00:40:40,030
I promised you

471
00:40:40,030 --> 00:40:42,070
that I wouldn't get in the way of the marriage of Tenth Prince and Lady Mingyu.

472
00:40:42,070 --> 00:40:44,310
You've already said many times

473
00:40:44,310 --> 00:40:46,990
that it will result in me getting beheaded. I know!

474
00:40:46,990 --> 00:40:48,190
It's good that you know.

475
00:40:49,950 --> 00:40:52,030
Actually, the freedom to love

476
00:40:52,030 --> 00:40:53,830
does not necessarily mean that it will result in a lasting relationship.

477
00:40:53,830 --> 00:40:55,590
When they enter into an arranged marriage,

478
00:40:55,590 --> 00:40:57,910
since there's no way out, and they have no other choices,

479
00:40:57,910 --> 00:41:00,710
who knows, they may be able to grow old together after all.

480
00:41:01,430 --> 00:41:02,450
Where did you hear

481
00:41:02,450 --> 00:41:03,590
such weird principles from?

482
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:06,430
What I'm saying is a fact.

483
00:41:06,430 --> 00:41:09,590
Madam, I feel that what Second Miss says makes sense.

484
00:41:09,590 --> 00:41:10,870
It's just like us women.

485
00:41:10,870 --> 00:41:13,050
Don't we all just want to find a good final home (aka husband's home),

486
00:41:13,050 --> 00:41:14,630
and for the people around us to treat us well?

487
00:41:16,350 --> 00:41:19,670
Just like the way Bei'le showed care and concern for you last night.

488
00:41:19,670 --> 00:41:22,030
And it's also because of Madame,

489
00:41:22,030 --> 00:41:23,850
that he's so forgiving

490
00:41:23,850 --> 00:41:25,230
towards Second Miss' preposterous and willful behavior.

491
00:41:26,630 --> 00:41:29,330
Who's being preposterous? Who's being willful?

492
00:41:31,150 --> 00:41:32,270
Second Miss.

493
00:41:32,270 --> 00:41:34,525
- Second Miss!
- You still dare to run?!

494
00:41:34,525 --> 00:41:36,128
- Your servant runs fast.
- Stop fooling around.

495
00:41:36,128 --> 00:41:37,030
You're still running?

496
00:41:37,030 --> 00:41:38,470
- Stop fooling around.
- Second Miss!

497
00:41:38,470 --> 00:41:39,239
Stop fooling around.

498
00:41:39,239 --> 00:41:40,793
Already, a few days ago, the Crown Prince

499
00:41:40,793 --> 00:41:42,310
gave each of the princes

500
00:41:42,310 --> 00:41:44,270
their consorts, princesses, young masters,

501
00:41:44,270 --> 00:41:45,510
and young mistresses the invitations,

502
00:41:45,510 --> 00:41:48,870
on which he invites everyone to a horse-riding competition and to have fun.

503
00:41:48,870 --> 00:41:50,190
I know! I know!

504
00:41:50,190 --> 00:41:52,217
In my opinion, he's just trying to say one thing.

505
00:41:52,217 --> 00:41:53,110
"I'm bored!

506
00:41:53,110 --> 00:41:54,471
Everyone come and play with me!"

507
00:41:56,190 --> 00:41:57,815
I haven't been feeling too well lately,

508
00:41:58,796 --> 00:42:00,590
tell them I won't be going.

509
00:42:02,050 --> 00:42:03,370
Yes.

510
00:42:05,236 --> 00:42:06,196
- Jiejie,
- Madam,

511
00:42:06,196 --> 00:42:07,530
why won't you go?

512
00:42:07,530 --> 00:42:09,764
In my opinion, Bei`le is definitely going.

513
00:42:09,764 --> 00:42:11,236
If Bei'le goes, Difujin will go, too.

514
00:42:11,236 --> 00:42:13,001
If Difujin goes, and we don't,

515
00:42:13,001 --> 00:42:14,608
aren't we just conceding defeat without even fighting?

516
00:42:14,608 --> 00:42:18,045
My sister is so great, why does she need to fight with anyone?

517
00:42:19,310 --> 00:42:20,863
But that being said,

518
00:42:20,863 --> 00:42:22,442
about competing horse-riding skills,

519
00:42:22,442 --> 00:42:23,729
even if you're not doing it to win,

520
00:42:23,729 --> 00:42:25,150
or doing it for rewards,

521
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:26,310
it's still an opportunity to

522
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:27,722
exercise both mind and body.

523
00:42:28,430 --> 00:42:29,859
If you're not feeling well,

524
00:42:29,859 --> 00:42:32,088
it's because you're always cooped up in here.

525
00:42:32,088 --> 00:42:33,063
That's why you haven't been feeling well.

526
00:42:33,063 --> 00:42:35,756
Let's go, Jiejie.

527
00:42:37,790 --> 00:42:38,870
I don't feel like going.

528
00:42:40,261 --> 00:42:42,350
But I really want to go!

529
00:42:42,350 --> 00:42:43,883
You can stand being cooped up here,

530
00:42:43,883 --> 00:42:45,198
but I can't stand it.

531
00:42:45,198 --> 00:42:47,727
The Crown Prince is bored. So am I.

532
00:42:47,727 --> 00:42:49,781
Jiejie, let's go...

533
00:42:52,986 --> 00:42:54,030
Then tell me, Jiejie,

534
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:55,554
why don't you want to go?

535
00:42:55,554 --> 00:42:57,397
Could it be you don't like horse-riding?

536
00:43:03,190 --> 00:43:05,190
If you didn't like horse-riding,

537
00:43:05,190 --> 00:43:07,270
then why would you like this painted screen?

538
00:43:07,270 --> 00:43:10,470
Imagine it, a herd of spirited horses

539
00:43:10,470 --> 00:43:12,650
galloping across

540
00:43:12,650 --> 00:43:15,190
a wide expanse of grassland.

541
00:43:15,190 --> 00:43:16,370
Even if you don't go there to ride,

542
00:43:16,370 --> 00:43:18,110
just thinking about it would make you happy.

543
00:43:20,070 --> 00:43:21,430
It's better than looking at a painting, right?

544
00:43:22,270 --> 00:43:24,030
Jiejie, don't you agree?

545
00:43:48,110 --> 00:43:49,250
Miss, you're feeling thirsty?

546
00:43:49,250 --> 00:43:50,470
I'll go pour a cup of water for you.

547
00:43:51,150 --> 00:43:52,070
Qiao Hui,

548
00:43:53,110 --> 00:43:55,630
I have something to ask you.

549
00:43:55,630 --> 00:43:57,670
What do you want to know, Miss?

550
00:43:57,670 --> 00:43:59,590
Come, let's sit and talk.

551
00:43:59,590 --> 00:44:00,830
You're letting me sit?

552
00:44:00,830 --> 00:44:02,470
Yeah, sit!

553
00:44:07,230 --> 00:44:11,110
Today, the painted screen that Jiejie was looking at,

554
00:44:11,110 --> 00:44:12,830
seems to have a special meaning to her, doesn't it?

555
00:44:12,830 --> 00:44:15,270
Yeah, she'll think of General.

556
00:44:19,310 --> 00:44:23,110
Who's General?

557
00:44:23,630 --> 00:44:25,550
Miss, you don't know?

558
00:44:25,550 --> 00:44:27,230
I'm testing you!

559
00:44:27,990 --> 00:44:29,510
You're testing me again?

560
00:44:32,310 --> 00:44:33,870
It's you who have forgotten it, isn't it?

561
00:44:41,270 --> 00:44:42,990
Actually, it's also a good thing that you've forgotten about it.

562
00:44:43,510 --> 00:44:44,350
Why?

563
00:44:45,110 --> 00:44:47,470
Miss, Old Master has already said!

564
00:44:47,470 --> 00:44:49,630
Whoever brings up this topic again will...

565
00:45:06,150 --> 00:45:09,470
This matter seems pretty serious.

566
00:45:17,510 --> 00:45:19,390
The Crown Prince is really interesting.

567
00:45:19,390 --> 00:45:21,790
A horse-riding competition will definitely be fun to watch.

568
00:45:21,790 --> 00:45:26,950
Not only do I want to awe the guys with my outstanding skills, and win all the rewards,

569
00:45:26,950 --> 00:45:28,790
I also have to awe the ladies with my stunning beauty,

570
00:45:28,790 --> 00:45:31,230
and make all the ladies and Fujins

571
00:45:31,230 --> 00:45:32,350
appear to be no match for me, in terms of looks.

572
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:46,070
Why aren't you getting a move on yet?

573
00:45:46,070 --> 00:45:47,790
You're only the Tenth Prince?

574
00:45:47,790 --> 00:45:49,670
Are you expecting to make the Crown Prince wait for you?

575
00:45:50,470 --> 00:45:52,350
I have no intention of making the Crown Prince wait.

576
00:45:52,350 --> 00:45:53,510
I...

577
00:45:53,710 --> 00:45:55,350
never said that I'd be going!

578
00:45:55,350 --> 00:45:56,510
You're not going?

579
00:45:58,270 --> 00:45:59,550
Why not?

580
00:45:59,550 --> 00:46:00,630
Because you're going.

581
00:46:00,630 --> 00:46:01,550
You--

582
00:46:04,510 --> 00:46:05,910
You're really not going?

583
00:46:07,030 --> 00:46:07,710
I'm not going.

584
00:46:10,910 --> 00:46:13,670
If so, then it's really such a pity.

585
00:46:13,670 --> 00:46:14,950
What's there to pity?

586
00:46:17,990 --> 00:46:19,190
Ruoxi would definitely go to

587
00:46:19,190 --> 00:46:21,190
this kind of occasion.

588
00:46:21,190 --> 00:46:22,750
If you don't go,

589
00:46:22,750 --> 00:46:24,710
then you won't be able to see the person you like.

590
00:46:26,590 --> 00:46:28,270
Even though you couldn't marry her,

591
00:46:28,950 --> 00:46:30,750
it would still be good to at least catch a glimpse of her.

592
00:46:32,670 --> 00:46:34,230
What a pity.

593
00:46:34,230 --> 00:46:36,510
The two of you really don't have any affinity,

594
00:46:36,510 --> 00:46:38,390
because you definitely cannot go.

595
00:46:38,390 --> 00:46:39,670
Why not?

596
00:46:39,670 --> 00:46:42,470
Because I insist on going!

597
00:46:47,190 --> 00:46:48,810
Where are you going?

598
00:46:48,810 --> 00:46:51,550
I'm going horse racing, going to see Ruoxi,

599
00:46:51,550 --> 00:46:53,230
going to go meet her.
- You-

600
00:46:55,050 --> 00:46:55,770
Didn't you say

601
00:46:55,770 --> 00:46:57,070
that you wouldn't go if I go?

602
00:46:57,070 --> 00:46:58,830
Weren't you finding it a pity?

603
00:46:58,830 --> 00:47:00,790
So I'm going to let you feel happy about it now.

604
00:47:00,790 --> 00:47:01,510
You...!!!
