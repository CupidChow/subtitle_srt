00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:19,600
♫  In the blink of an eye, a thought of stubborn persistence  ♫

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,900
♫  We were destined to seek our doom like moths flying towards the flame  ♫

4
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:30,620
♫  Knowing that it’d be a disaster, why am I still at a loss about what to do  ♫

5
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:38,870
♫  The best is not to see, the best is not to miss you  ♫

6
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:43,770
♫  Only like this can I not be in love with you  ♫

7
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:48,090
♫  Just another brushing of the shoulder, and from then...♫

8
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:53,290
♫  I’ll keep falling deeper and deeper in love with you  ♫

9
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:58,230
♫  It’s the mistake of time, ♫

10
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:01,690
♫ forcing us to pass each other by  ♫

11
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,370
♫  How I miss you, how far you are  ♫

12
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:08,020
♫  Even though I’d known it’d only result in pain,  ♫

13
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:11,570
♫ at this moment, I still don’t want to escape   ♫

14

♫  we can only pass each other by  ♫

00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:35,190

♫  Even though I know the ending is a mistake that I cannot oppose  ♫

♫  Staying in this moment  ♫

22
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:55,160

Scarlet Heart
Episode 24

24
00:02:23,239 --> 00:02:26,180
This snuff bottle, do you still want it?

25
00:02:30,282 --> 00:02:32,100
If you have the nerve, then keep it.

26
00:02:33,193 --> 00:02:35,422
Just do not regret it in the future.

27
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:40,180
Give it to her.  I am afraid that the item was from someone powerful.

28
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:41,580
Quick, just return it to her.

29
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,300
I gave it back.

30
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,900
Today, an event happening like this.

31
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:58,480
It is not what I wished for.

32
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,120
Since, we still have to spend a long time together in the future,

33
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,460
I want to let you know something clearly.

34
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,220
As they say,

35
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:10,600
a phoenix without tail feathers is worse off than a chicken.

36
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,340
But it is also said that a centipede with a thousand legs

37
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:14,100
dies but never falls down.

38
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:16,560
You have been in the palace for many years.

39
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,180
Promotions and demotions,

40
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:19,820
you should have seen plenty.

41
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:23,180
You should leave a space for yourselves in everything.

42
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:26,380
I know,

43
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:28,460
Eunuch Zhang normally gives me special treatment

44
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:31,220
and you all have suffered a lot.

45
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:34,700
That is my wrong.

46
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,400
From today on,

47
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,460
we should all understand each other more,

48
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:44,260
try to make less mistakes,

49
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:47,580
so events like this will not happen again.

50
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:49,620
If there are more events like this...

51
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:53,820
I am going to ask everyone to please excuse me now,

52
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:59,140
but those who treat me badly,

53
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:01,800
I won't quickly forget.

54
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,660
Any person who treats me well,

55
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:07,020
I will definitely remember and repay their kindness.

56
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:10,460
In truth, I had already planned to give gifts to my sisters.

57
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:13,060
I just did not know your preferences in this short a time,

58
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:15,140
so I did not casually give out gifts.

59
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:26,660
Mei'mei (Younger Sister).  Please accept this for my sake.

60
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:31,220
If you don't mind, then I will take one too.

61
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:33,000
Sure.

62
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,340
We are all sisters.  Please don't be too polite.

63
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:37,140
Thank you.

64
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,140
Alright, alright.

65
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:40,420
Eat some melon seeds.  Eat some melon seeds.

66
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:42,820
Today's seeds are extra tasty. Delicious and crunchy.

67
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:45,180
Come, come, come. Let's eat together

68
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:51,740
Eat. Eat.

69
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:54,340
Greetings, Lady Rouxi.

70
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:56,100
Eunuch Cao.

71
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:58,740
Please do not be like that.  I do not deserve it.

72
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,960
Getting to see Lady was not an easy task.

73
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,020
Wang'ye (Prince} sent this to you.

74
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,660
Inside there are banknotes of small amounts.

75
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:10,980
Keep those with you so you don't need to worry about losing things that are not easy to give away.

76
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:14,060
The medicine you wanted was sent to your room already.

77
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:16,060
Thank you very much,  Eunuch Cao.

78
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:18,780
If you have anything you need, you can come find me.

79
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:20,900
I will take my leave now.

80
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:29,620
Eunuch Zhang.

81
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,540
Can you...

82
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:33,740
No need for that, no need.

83
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:36,340
Then I will take my leave.

84
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,940
Rouxi.

85
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:48,580
Eunuch Zhang.

86
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:50,300
Follow me.

87
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,860
Yes.

88
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:16,140
10th Prince. 14th Prince.

89
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:21,820
Greetings to the Princes.

90
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:23,240
What are you doing here?

91
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,780
Why are you like this?

92
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:26,640
Didn't you say everything had been arranged well?

93
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,940
A certain work must have a certain look.

94
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:30,980
How is Zhang'xian'yin (treacherous) treating you?

95
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:33,260
Eunuch Zhang has been taking good care of me.

96
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:36,220
If he dares to treat you in any beastly manner, I will have his head fall to the ground!

97
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:37,820
I know.

98
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:41,940
Alright, let's sit and talk.

99
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:43,420
Is there anything wrong?

100
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,300
Is it my sister?

101
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:49,400
Your sister is well,

102
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,020
even though her body is weak.

103
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:52,420
But you already knew

104
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:54,900
because she's always been like this throughout the years.

105
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:58,100
Then what's wrong

106
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:00,460
that both Princes personally looked for me?

107
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:02,180
After the dead eagle event,

108
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:03,900
8th Prince suffered a big shock

109
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,420
and was very sick.

110
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:07,220
Though his illness has gone,

111
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:09,520
he is still feeling very discouraged,

112
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,780
8th Brother has not been very healthy.  So with the pressure from inside and outside,

113
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:14,580
he has become sick again.

114
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:17,320
This time the illness is more serious.

115
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,220
The Imperial Physician said...

116
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:22,700
Imperial father spoke four words to the Imperial Physician,

117
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:24,380
"Use your best treatments."

118
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:29,880
Ruoxi, that's why we came to look for you.

119
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:32,560
If you have anything to tell him,

120
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:34,740
tell us and we will pass it on.

121
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:36,420
A letter is alright too.

122
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:38,740
Did 8th Prince send you two here?

123
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:40,700
It was my idea.

124
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:42,819
8th prince has been unconscious.

125
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:47,900
Rouxi, what happened between you and 8th Brother?

126
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:49,860
How is everything in the 8th Prince's manor?

127
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,980
How are 8th Fu'jin and my sister?
( Fu'jin - Legal wife, sister is 2nd wife/concubine)

128
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:54,020
8th Sister-in-law is really a hero among women,

129
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:56,100
I admire her wholeheartedly.

130
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:59,100
Think about it.  After 13th Brother got into trouble

131
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:01,220
and his manor became a total mess,

132
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:03,700
even such things as petty thefts happened.

133
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:05,020
13th Fu'jin

134
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:08,620
had to dismiss all her unnecessary servants.

135
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:09,720
However, 8th Sister-in-law

136
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:13,100
did not allow any trouble to happen in his manor.

137
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:15,220
About your sister,

138
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:16,820
on behalf of you and 8th Prince,

139
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:21,780
she worries day and night. She kneels in front of Buddha chanting and praying.

140
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:23,740
I heard from Qiao'hui
(Qiao 'house' maid)

141
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:26,180
she will cry several times a day.

142
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:31,460
Please wait then.

143
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:38,580
[ Happiness causes worry and suffering.]

144
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:41,140
[ Happiness causes fear and fright. ]

145
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:43,520
[ There will be no worry and suffering without happiness. ]

146
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,980
[ Fear and fright should be nowhere to find. ]

147
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,720
[ Love creates worry and suffering to grow. ]

148
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,520
[ Love also creates more fear and fright. ]

149
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:54,240
[ Without love there will be no worries and suffering, ]

150
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,760
[ Fear and fright will be nowhere to be found. ]

151
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,800
[ Therefore, one should not love ]

152
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,720
[ because love and separation create suffering. ]

153
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,040
[ If there is no love or hate ]

154
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:09,400
[ you will be free without any burdens. ]

155
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:16,400
The ability of Beile'ye is enough to fix the whole realm.

156
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:20,200
The love of Beile'ye is like flowers in a mirror and the moon reflected in water.

157
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,880
Beile'ye, you have high ambitions.

158
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:26,040
Even though you put all your heart into the empire,

159
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:29,320
you are not someone who does not have emotion.

160
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,700
"If there is no love or hate,

161
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:35,000
you will be free without burdens."

162
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,000
In this letter from Ruoxi to me,

163
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,660
she advises me that

164
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:43,960
one should guard their self against worry and fear.

165
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:50,140
I think she found a way to have a peace of mind in that laundry place.

166
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:53,985
So Beile'ye, you should not worry anymore.

167
00:10:55,796 --> 00:10:58,118
You can even imitate her.

168
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,764
I never thought that

169
00:11:02,089 --> 00:11:04,411
she would have such a strong will.

170
00:11:06,106 --> 00:11:08,776
I am defeated.

171
00:11:09,264 --> 00:11:11,307
She is not.

172
00:11:12,468 --> 00:11:14,233
Previously,

173
00:11:14,233 --> 00:11:17,344
I worried about her every day.

174
00:11:18,668 --> 00:11:20,880
I don't know when it started

175
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,964
but that most troublesome girl

176
00:11:23,242 --> 00:11:25,720
suddenly grew up.

177
00:11:26,818 --> 00:11:28,583
Now the roles are reversed.

178
00:11:29,047 --> 00:11:32,066
We have to learn from her not to give up.

179
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,328
She has taught me

180
00:11:37,708 --> 00:11:40,200
what it really means to let everything go.

181
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,143
Before, because of love, I

182
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:45,301
could not break my self away from hate.

183
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:49,759
But Ruo'xi says,

184
00:11:51,408 --> 00:11:53,519
once everything is released,

185
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:55,160
there will be no more pain or suffering.

186
00:11:57,956 --> 00:12:00,471
Once, I hated you, Beile'ye,

187
00:12:00,471 --> 00:12:02,440
but after I read this letter,

188
00:12:03,366 --> 00:12:04,840
I know

189
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:08,150
that the person who is making me unhappy was not someone else,

190
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:09,821
it was me, myself.

191
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,320
A proverb says,

192
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,840
'Life hurriedly counts ten years'.

193
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:20,100
Why should I burden myself with something that I could take with me

194
00:12:20,108 --> 00:12:22,280
that would suffocate me.

195
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:31,440
[ 56th year of Kangxi's reign, the Empress Dowager passes away ]

196
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:40,007
I just received an urgent message.

197
00:12:40,007 --> 00:12:42,362
Sele and Eluntejun

198
00:12:42,362 --> 00:12:44,698
were finally heavily surrounded when they marched in.

199
00:12:44,698 --> 00:12:47,020
Their whole army was completely annihilated.

200
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:50,100
Do you two have any opinions?

201
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:51,362
Replying to Your Majesty,

202
00:12:51,362 --> 00:12:52,680
your servant thinks this way.

203
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,657
Since Zun'ge'er just won recently, I think

204
00:12:54,657 --> 00:12:56,460
so their morale was very high.

205
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:58,680
Our army should avoid their vanguard

206
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,534
and ask for an armistice.

207
00:13:00,534 --> 00:13:02,616
When should this armistice end?

208
00:13:02,616 --> 00:13:06,360
That... That needs to be carefully considered for the long-term results.

209
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,340
Replying to Your Majesty,

210
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:09,280
I also agree with an armistice for now.

211
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,880
The roads to Tibet are often rugged and dangerous.

212
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:14,640
Impediments to transportation become a problem.

213
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:17,300
What if ambushes cause rations and animal fodder to become insufficient,

214
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:20,431
what would happen to our army?

215
00:13:20,431 --> 00:13:21,960
Was this your first time knowing

216
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,680
how to fight over there?

217
00:13:24,195 --> 00:13:27,180
Are you now so scared to death by the enemy army

218
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:29,080
you're unwilling to fight?

219
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,220
To protect the realm,

220
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:33,901
ten thousand deaths will not prevent me!

221
00:14:03,506 --> 00:14:04,800
Your Majesty,

222
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,200
you did not sleep for several nights,

223
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,800
please take care of your health.

224
00:14:11,912 --> 00:14:14,800
All of the northwest area belongs to

225
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,160
King Cealabudan now,

226
00:14:18,831 --> 00:14:21,618
how can I sleep well?

227
00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:26,760
I underestimated the enemy.

228
00:14:34,894 --> 00:14:36,880
[ The northwest area was occupied ]

229
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,440
[ but the military officials in the Imperial Court did not support the Emperor sending in army reinforcements. ]

230
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,180
[ Due to the urgent situation both outside and inside, ]

231
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:47,080
[ the Emperor moved the date up and appointed the 14th Prince as the Fuyuan General. ]

232
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,800
[ He took command and lead the (replacement) army to the frontier. ]

233
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:19,018
Move out!

234
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:28,820
14th Brother is very clever.

235
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:30,080
He is capable and has a refined character.

236
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:32,760
We, brothers, cannot compare to him.

237
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:40,160
9th Brother.

238
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,920
8th brother. The wind here is strong.

239
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:44,840
You just recovered from illness and should not stand out here a long time.

240
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,560
I should accompany you back inside.

241
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:48,380
Compared to 14th Brother,

242
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:50,280
standing a while is just a small matter.

243
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,920
As long as the General

244
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:55,140
can save the common people from a predicament

245
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:57,080
and not disappoint Imperial Father,

246
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,049
my wishes will be fulfilled.

247
00:17:00,373 --> 00:17:03,500
The Emperor gave 14th Prince such an important duty.

248
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:06,160
It seems that he will become the Crown Prince.

249
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:10,040
That's right. The Emperor even said 14th Prince is the most similar to himself.

250
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,980
Among all the Princes,

251
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:15,319
the 14th prince has become the first one among the brothers.

252
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:16,820
No one else can touch him.

253
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:18,345
Yes.

254
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,640
Master.  The 4th Prince is asking to see the Emperor.

255
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,378
- Leave.
- Yes.

256
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:49,600
Emperor.

257
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,975
4th Prince is outside and is asking to see you.

258
00:17:52,375 --> 00:17:52,890
Let him in.

259
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:53,960
Yes.

260
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:56,280
Allow 4th Prince to enter!

261
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,624
Greetings, Imperial Father.

262
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:09,620
Rise.

263
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:11,294
Thank you, Imperial Father.

264
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:14,180
4th Prince, why are you looking for me?

265
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:18,121
I heard that Imperial Father has not slept or rested because of the war in northwest.

266
00:18:18,121 --> 00:18:20,600
I specifically asked the Imperial Physician's Pharmacy to make a special tonic.

267
00:18:22,254 --> 00:18:23,120
Take those.

268
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,440
Yes

269
00:18:29,965 --> 00:18:31,520
Recently,  when I've seen Imperial Father,

270
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,469
you seem to have become much thinner and more pallid.

271
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:37,620
I dare to ask Imperial Father to please take care of your health.

272
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:40,435
The country still needs Imperial Father.

273
00:18:40,435 --> 00:18:42,240
I will.

274
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:44,400
Leave now.

275
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,160
Thank you, Imperial Father.  I'll take my leave now.

276
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,072
Please wait, Prince.

277
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,858
Emperor. Concerning

278
00:18:52,858 --> 00:18:54,420
those problems that we could not solve.

279
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:55,140
Why not

280
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:57,120
ask for the Prince's opinion?

281
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,040
I had the same thought.

282
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,600
Alright.

283
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,640
Prince,

284
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,700
before we were talking with the Emperor

285
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,800
regarding the war in northwest.

286
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:11,160
However, we felt that it would be best to transfer troops from Mongolia.

287
00:19:11,357 --> 00:19:14,160
What do you think?

288
00:19:15,119 --> 00:19:17,200
I think it is a good idea.

289
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,880
Know yourself, know your enemy, one will come unscathed through a hundred battles. (From Art of War)

290
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:22,040
But that is also where the problem lies.

291
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,520
What if the troops think because they are from the same homeland roots,

292
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,580
then turn around and fight us instead.

293
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:26,640
We will then be in a worse position.

294
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,480
Even though the tribes in Mongolia are all the same ethnic group,

295
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,220
they have been fighting and annexing each other since ancient times.

296
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:33,080
If one is not from the same tribe, the treatment received will be very different

297
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:35,100
and they will show no mercy.

298
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:37,760
I think Imperial Father knows this point well.

299
00:19:38,216 --> 00:19:42,084
Yes.  What your saying is right

300
00:19:42,084 --> 00:19:43,220
Nian Gengyao.

301
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:44,080
Yes.

302
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,320
That is the way we'll do it!

303
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,480
Yes.

304
00:19:47,727 --> 00:19:50,700
Emperor, I have a suggestion.

305
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:51,704
Speak.

306
00:19:51,704 --> 00:19:53,880
These are now trouble-filled times,

307
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:56,580
the Imperial Court really needs capable people.

308
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:59,500
Since the Prince is talented,

309
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:00,380
I think that

310
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:02,560
the Prince should step up and serve the Imperial Court.

311
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:05,120
This way, first of all, the Emperor would be more at ease

312
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,030
and secondly, the country would benefit from it too.

313
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,400
Good!

314
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,080
Prince, this time you were put into an important position by Emperor.

315
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,900
That is a very good and happy news.

316
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,360
Congratulations, Master.

317
00:20:26,167 --> 00:20:27,124
Master,

318
00:20:27,124 --> 00:20:29,207
do you have any other opinions?

319
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:31,575
No.

320
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:36,620
How is it?

321
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:37,557
The 13th Prince...

322
00:20:37,557 --> 00:20:38,600
good news finally arrived.

323
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:41,080
A baby girl was born.

324
00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:48,040
Ruoxi.

325
00:20:49,772 --> 00:20:51,320
Come here.

326
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,200
Eunuch Zhang.

327
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,920
Is there anything wrong?

328
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,240
Rouxi.

329
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,080
This baby is...

330
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:22,080
This baby was born to Thirteenth Brother and Lu Wu.

331
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,440
Really?

332
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,480
Why is it here?

333
00:21:28,301 --> 00:21:31,327
Life in Yangfengjiadao is not fit for normal people.

334
00:21:31,327 --> 00:21:33,860
It is okay for adults to bear,

335
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:36,234
but infants would not be able to survive.

336
00:21:36,234 --> 00:21:37,620
Therefore, I asked Imperial Father

337
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:39,020
to allow me to raise her.

338
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:41,080
Imperial Father agreed.

339
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:44,600
She still doesn't have a name.

340
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:45,920
The person who carried her to my estate said that

341
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,360
13th Brother and Lu Wu would

342
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,480
like you to choose a name.

343
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,080
They want me to choose a name?

344
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,120
Imperial Father had already thought of a name,

345
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:57,600
but after he heard about this,

346
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,920
he agreed to let you decide.

347
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:02,120
Then we will present the name to him

348
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:05,240
and Imperial Father will name her that name.

349
00:22:06,173 --> 00:22:07,680
Rouxi,

350
00:22:09,092 --> 00:22:11,840
Imperial Father really misses you.

351
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,560
What name

352
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:17,480
shall I give her?

353
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:23,000
This child has to be separated from her parents.

354
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,820
How about Cheng Huan?

355
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:28,520
Cater to (parents) happily on knees.
(become happy and serve parents)

356
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:33,200
Good. That's the name then.

357
00:22:39,456 --> 00:22:40,480
Xiao Shun Zi.

358
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,680
Your servant is here.

359
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,200
Come,

360
00:22:45,886 --> 00:22:47,040
hold her well.

361
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,200
Yes.

362
00:22:57,257 --> 00:22:59,480
How is your health lately?

363
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,280
Does your knee still hurt?

364
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:04,562
The herbal plaster that you asked Xiao Shun Zi to send me is very useful

365
00:23:04,562 --> 00:23:05,920
In here, you need to avoid dwelling on unpleasant things.

366
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,320
Don't worry too much.

367
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,640
Every day I write, several times,

368
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,160
the sentence that you gave me.

369
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:15,240
"Follow the road to the end of water,

370
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:17,760
sit down and watch the clouds appear."

371
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,480
I can only use this method to let you know

372
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:25,600
that I am always here.

373
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,960
Do you regret?

374
00:23:31,112 --> 00:23:33,560
Suffering here while waiting for me.

375
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:35,560
I do not regret.

376
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,920
The wait is definitely not in vain.

377
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,360
It's getting late.

378
00:23:56,129 --> 00:23:57,760
I have to leave.

379
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:19,820
It seems that he is carrying the weight of the world on his shoulders,

380
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:21,824
just because for him,

381
00:24:21,824 --> 00:24:23,640
it is not just the Imperial throne.

382
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,380
It is also the future of 13th Prince,

383
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:26,920
and also mine.

384
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:30,600
All of these heavily press down on his shoulders.

385
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,080
Waist sores and back hurts

386
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,200
Yes.

387
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,120
There are so many clothes to wash.

388
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:36,760
Here is one more barrel full.

389
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,520
Please pass me that.

390
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:39,903
Do you know

391
00:24:39,903 --> 00:24:42,200
14th Prince won another battle in the northwest.

392
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,500
Really?

393
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:44,780
We are sharing in the 14th Prince's blessings

394
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:46,580
because the whole country can be safe.

395
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:47,760
Right. Correct

396
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:51,600
Having the14th Prince means the empire is safe and all other countries will have to pay tribute  and heed the Emperor's rulings.

397
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,900
- That is so wonderful.
-  Yes

398
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:54,400
I head that 14th Prince is very impressive.

399
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,640
Tall and strong.

400
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:56,960
He has had many victories.

401
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,162
He probably looks very awe-inspiring.

402
00:25:01,321 --> 00:25:03,520
Legendary stories from the war gradually arrived.

403
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:06,800
A lot of tribes started to support 14th Prince.

404
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:09,640
14th Prince's name was spreading far.

405
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:13,001
He was the hero general in everyone's heart.

406
00:25:20,208 --> 00:25:23,120
There are many changes in Laundry place.

407
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:26,492
Chuntao and Yanping were released from the Palace.

408
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,120
With the leaving of Chuntao and Yanping,

409
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:40,200
two new young girls came.

410
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,120
Qian'qian and Ling'dang

411
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,680
14th Prince is really amazing.

412
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:46,000
He fought so many battles and won them all.

413
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,320
Of course.

414
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:49,780
The 14th Prince is a general well versed in letters and military technology.

415
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:52,580
He is lively and elegant.

416
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:55,020
How do you know? Have you met the 14th Prince?

417
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:56,072
No I have not.

418
00:25:56,072 --> 00:25:58,920
Sister Rouxi, have you met the 14th Prince?

419
00:25:59,934 --> 00:26:01,920
The 14th Prince I know--

420
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,595
doesn't seem like that.

421
00:26:03,595 --> 00:26:04,380
- Then what is he like?
- Tell us.

422
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:05,406
- Tell us.
- Tell us.

423
00:26:05,406 --> 00:26:06,780
- Please tell us.
- Please.

424
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:08,961
Please tell us, Elder Sister Rouxi.

425
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,760
More time passed.

426
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:27,280
Finally, the news arrived that 14th Prince would be returning to the Capital.

427
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:30,160
Every palace maid wished to see the elegant demeanor of him.

428
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,880
The 14th Prince has returned to the Palace.

429
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:35,112
I guess that we will soon see the General's grateful bearing.

430
00:26:35,112 --> 00:26:37,800
We will see whether we'll be fortunate enough for that.

431
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:40,665
It is always good to have some hope.

432
00:26:40,665 --> 00:26:41,960
Yes.

433
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,483
14th Prince, this way.

434
00:26:58,060 --> 00:27:00,880
14th Prince, if you please.

435
00:27:14,046 --> 00:27:15,160
Have everyone leave

436
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,500
except for Rouxi.

437
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:17,840
Yes.

438
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:21,140
Hurry up and greet 14th Prince before you leave.

439
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:23,200
- Greetings, 14th Prince.
- Greetings, 14th Prince.

440
00:27:24,704 --> 00:27:25,820
Hurry up and leave!

441
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:27,600
- Yes.
- Yes.

442
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:36,680
14th Prince, I will take my leave.

443
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,917
Greetings, 14th Prince.

444
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:54,680
You're the hero in many maidens' hearts right now.

445
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:01,160
It has been so many years.

446
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:04,760
Although, I asked Imperial Father for marriage,

447
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:07,000
Imperial Father has never promised me.

448
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,920
Even though, I asked Imperial Father for the marriage

449
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:13,200
and asked him to forgive you because you served him for so many years.

450
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:15,720
Even if it a bigger mistake,

451
00:28:16,453 --> 00:28:19,480
all these years of hard labor should have been more than enough.

452
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:21,560
Can you guess how Imperial Father responded?

453
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:26,760
Why do you dislike me so much

454
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:29,261
that you'd rather stay here and wash clothes?

455
00:28:29,261 --> 00:28:31,880
But you don't want to marry me, is that right?

456
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,640
Today, if you don't explain

457
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,800
and talk about other topics, the questions will still remain.

458
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,240
I have enough patience to

459
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:41,240
wait for your answer.

460
00:28:43,002 --> 00:28:44,880
It's not your fault.

461
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:49,520
You are good, very good.

462
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:53,480
It is my fault.

463
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,060
Then, I'm going to ask you.

464
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:58,880
As long as you respond, it's fine.

465
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:05,680
In your heart, do you have someone else?

466
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:12,740
Fine.

467
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:15,864
You already gave me an answer.

468
00:29:15,864 --> 00:29:18,120
Is it 8th Brother or 4th Brother?

469
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:20,200
What is the meaning of asking about them?

470
00:29:22,003 --> 00:29:23,980
Looks like it's 4th Brother.

471
00:29:29,767 --> 00:29:32,580
He is staying at his manor, being a wealthy and unconcerned man.

472
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:35,208
Yet, you are here enduring hardship.

473
00:29:36,019 --> 00:29:40,000
Is it worth giving him your whole heart?

474
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:48,040
The way you treat me, is it worth it?

475
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:52,840
The time when you  risked your life in a horse race because of me,

476
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:54,240
ever since then

477
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:57,200
I became determined to treat you the same way 13th Prince did.

478
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,820
Treat you as a friend and treat you sincerely.

479
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:01,320
I tried my best to be your friend.

480
00:30:02,514 --> 00:30:04,520
I have achieved that

481
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:06,040
or at least I can say it with a clear conscience.

482
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:10,300
You really do not need to be like this.

483
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:12,320
That day was for myself also,

484
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,860
you do not owe me anything.

485
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:16,160
If not for me,

486
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:18,980
you would not have fallen to your current position.

487
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:20,980
If you were really doing it for yourself,

488
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:23,920
you could really have pushed the responsibility off onto me

489
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:26,560
and you wouldn't have had to risk your life in that horserace.

490
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:31,720
You look much thinner and paler.

491
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:34,700
You became more charming and handsome.

492
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:38,939
You're still not willing to marry me,

493
00:30:38,939 --> 00:30:40,440
isn't that right?

494
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:45,080
Whatever then.

495
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:48,000
If you don't want to stay here

496
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,560
you can look for me any time.

497
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:51,000
Thank you.

498
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:52,760
Don't forget

499
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:54,540
what Physician Li told you before,

500
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:57,480
less thinking and avoid worrying.

501
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:59,280
I've remembered.

502
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:01,200
It doesn't mean that if you remembered, it's all right.

503
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,480
What is most important is to let go.

504
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:06,340
I have plans for our problem.

505
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:08,760
You do not have to worry.

506
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:13,000
The most important thing right now is to take care of yourself. Understood?

507
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,600
Your Majesty..

508
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:40,520
It's cold and the wind is strong.

509
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:41,912
How about we go back early and rest?

510
00:31:41,912 --> 00:31:42,840
No need.

511
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:45,320
Today, the feeling of riding horses

512
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,927
makes me know my physical strength is much worse than before.

513
00:31:46,927 --> 00:31:48,280
I am not as strong as I wish.

514
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:51,600
The elegant manner of Emperor on a horse is the same as before.

515
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,340
It is not even a string less then before

516
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:55,660
It is only because you have been exposed to the wind and cold

517
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:56,760
that you feel that way.

518
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:59,700
Emperor.  Please do not worry too much.

519
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:00,700
Let's go back to the Palace.

520
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:01,680
Alright.

521
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:06,170
The Emperor's health had become a little bit better.

522
00:32:06,170 --> 00:32:07,980
Just the qi (inner energy) and good blood flow are still lacking.

523
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:09,100
Besides taking medicine,

524
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:11,180
it needs to be dealt with by adding certain foods.

525
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:12,580
This will make the qi stronger.

526
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:15,000
My appetite has been bad lately.

527
00:32:16,101 --> 00:32:18,400
For all the food that the imperial kitchen prepares,

528
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:23,127
I can't seem to get interested in it.

529
00:32:24,126 --> 00:32:26,239
Count it as eating uselessly.

530
00:32:27,214 --> 00:32:29,340
I eat but do not know the taste of what I eat.

531
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:32,819
Whatever your body lacks is what you need the most.

532
00:32:32,819 --> 00:32:36,960
Emperor, please pick some foods and give up some foods based on whatever food you want.

533
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,628
That way your appetite will be improved.

534
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:42,280
Pastry.

535
00:32:46,997 --> 00:32:50,360
It's been so long since I've eaten any pastries.

536
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:55,357
It has been a very long time.

537
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,580
Eunuch Wang.

538
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:15,140
Elder Sister, you made me wait so long!

539
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:16,905
Elder Sister, come with me, please get into the palanquin.

540
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:39,428
Eunuch Wang.

541
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,420
Your looking for Ruoxi today

542
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:43,190
for what reason?

543
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:46,766
His Majesty wants to eat some delicious things.

544
00:33:46,766 --> 00:33:48,440
The imperial kitchen has exhausted all their ideas.

545
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,884
The imperial kitchen wanted to come up with a plan but just couldn't.

546
00:33:49,884 --> 00:33:51,240
My Master guessed

547
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,460
His Majesty was thinking of you

548
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:54,940
and the great pastries you made.

549
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:56,280
He was going to call people in to make some,

550
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:57,340
however, there would not be enough time.

551
00:33:57,340 --> 00:33:59,840
Since he couldn't wait, he asked for you to come to the Palace instead.

552
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,671
Is His Majesty's body all right?

553
00:34:02,671 --> 00:34:06,247
Much better, just easily irritated.

554
00:34:09,337 --> 00:34:11,230
If I did not remember wrong

555
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:13,724
this is the year when the Emperor will pass away.

556
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:17,680
November of Kangxi year 61.

557
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:20,713
Everything will not be far off.

558
00:34:42,359 --> 00:34:44,079
I'll leave now.

559
00:34:46,998 --> 00:34:49,160
Sister, you have returned.

560
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:57,840
Must have been hard for you all these years.

561
00:35:14,516 --> 00:35:17,800
Sister, do you want to go to my rooms to rest a bit?

562
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,000
No need.

563
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,492
Bringing me directly to the kitchens will be fine.

564
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:27,960
This should be the last time I'll get to make pastries for His Majesty.

565
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:31,300
In regards to His Majesty,

566
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:33,960
I have fears and

567
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:37,516
I have compassion.

568
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:40,480
All that has now changed into not willing to be apart.

569
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:43,251
I am just waiting for that moment to come.

570
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:29,227
This was not made by Yutan.

571
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:33,429
Tell her to come see me.

572
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:45,200
One taste, I

573
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,920
knew that this pastry

574
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,864
was made by you.

575
00:36:48,864 --> 00:36:51,960
This light and non-greasy pastry

576
00:36:53,050 --> 00:36:55,000
has really

577
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,100
whetted my usually poor appetite.

578
00:36:58,100 --> 00:37:01,760
I am willing to make pastries for you anytime

579
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:04,840
if it can help to benefit your health.

580
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:06,440
Good.

581
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,720
Raise your head now.

582
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:15,320
Let me see you properly.

583
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,940
Your face is so pale!

584
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:25,680
Have you been sick?

585
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:29,360
Replying to His Majesty, I have been well.

586
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:31,860
Then why is your complexion not so good?

587
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:33,160
Replying to Your Majesty,

588
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:35,680
I've only had some small aches.

589
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:37,420
That is nothing worthy of mentioning.

590
00:37:37,618 --> 00:37:39,400
No need for Your Majesty to worry.

591
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:43,809
One's body, skin, and hair are all gifts from one's parents.

592
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:49,080
You must take better care of your health.

593
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:52,000
I will listen to the Emperor's words

594
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:01,520
His Majesty did not say if I could come home?

595
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,760
Letting you stay was actually Eunuch Li's suggestion.

596
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,620
But the bigger part of it was His Majesty's idea.

597
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:08,004
Jie'jie. Don't worry about that

598
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:13,800
Yutan, has the Emperor mentioned anything about you leaving the palace?

599
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:18,040
His Majesty doesn't know how old I am.

600
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:20,080
The empire has been at war.

601
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,480
The State Treasury has a tight budget

602
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,920
and various disasters are continually happening.

603
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:24,720
The Emperor's heart is completely focused on that.

604
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:25,900
For us lowly people,

605
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:27,560
he does not have the energy left to be considerate.

606
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:28,740
Then how can Eunuch Li

607
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:30,899
not worry?

608
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,080
He also asked me twice for my opinion.

609
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:34,680
I didn't want to go outside the palace.

610
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:36,400
So he didn't bring it up again.

611
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:37,640
Anyway,

612
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:39,407
Eunuch Li would love for me to stay.

613
00:38:39,407 --> 00:38:43,926
Whenever Eunuch Li wants something to do done, he will ask me or Eunuch Wang to handle it.

614
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:48,360
In order to train a proper servant, changing over every three to five years is not doable.

615
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:50,320
That is true.

616
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,800
This time the Emperor's sickness

617
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,780
is very severe.

618
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:58,066
I don't think that the Emperor's illness is quite that severe.

619
00:38:58,066 --> 00:38:59,180
But this time, with Sister coming back

620
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:01,880
the Emperor took pity on you.

621
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:05,543
Maybe he'll let you continue serving him,

622
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:08,280
but your complexion does not look too good either.

623
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:12,720
If Jie'jie really could come back here, I will need to nurse Jie'jie back to being more healthy.

624
00:39:14,701 --> 00:39:16,480
Even the close servants

625
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:19,240
do not think his sickness is too serious.

626
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,280
Therefore the officials in the Imperial Court

627
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,028
will also treat it lightly.

628
00:39:23,228 --> 00:39:24,440
I don't remember if the Emperor

629
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:27,120
died of the current illness.

630
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:32,320
In the days that came later, people were suspicious of why Kang'xi would die all of a sudden.

631
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,360
It can't be...

632
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:39,514
Sister, what's wrong?

633
00:39:40,723 --> 00:39:44,321
These last few days, did 4th prince come here a lot?

634
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:46,280
He came daily.

635
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:48,380
Sometimes even 3 or 4 times.

636
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:50,360
Even when the Emperor was in bad spirits

637
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:51,680
and stopped seeing the Princes.

638
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:54,480
But he would still see the Fourth Prince.

639
00:39:55,754 --> 00:39:59,019
Why do you ask?

640
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:02,800
Which prince do you think Emperor will pick?

641
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:06,200
It should be 14th Prince.

642
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:07,660
His Majesty has been pondering

643
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:10,360
if he should call 14th Prince to return,

644
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:12,858
but he was almost home anyway.

645
00:40:12,858 --> 00:40:15,880
But isn't the Emperor good to the 4th prince too?

646
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:18,400
Yes, among the brothers,

647
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:21,560
the ones he dotes on the most are the 14th and the 4th.

648
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,460
Sister,

649
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:24,820
don't think too much.

650
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:27,040
I will get you some warm water.

651
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:33,280
Did 4th Prince do something?

652
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:39,360
No.  He wouldn't.

653
00:40:39,386 --> 00:40:40,420
Imperial Father.

654
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:41,680
You didn't sleep well again.

655
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,600
Did the coughing interrupt your sleep?

656
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:44,640
I never thought

657
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:47,580
the cold would come on so strongly and quickly.

658
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:49,276
The Imperial Physicians said that

659
00:40:49,276 --> 00:40:50,640
as long as you take care

660
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:51,616
and eat the medicine on time,

661
00:40:51,616 --> 00:40:54,100
you will get better naturally.

662
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:55,480
Here.

663
00:41:13,782 --> 00:41:15,621
Rouxi.

664
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,160
Have you seen the doctor yet?

665
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:19,960
Not yet.

666
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,360
You forgot!

667
00:41:22,522 --> 00:41:24,840
Thank you, for your concern.

668
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:33,760
4th Son, sit with me a while.

669
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:35,880
Thank you, Imperial Father.

670
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:43,800
Recently, the empire's matters are extremely tight

671
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:46,520
and the war is still ongoing.

672
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:49,360
My health has become worse.

673
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:51,880
I really feel that the spirit is willing but the flesh is weak.

674
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:53,480
Imperial Father, your body is under the influence of cold,

675
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:56,160
but your concern day and night is still for the country and for the people.

676
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:57,840
That is why you would have such thoughts.

677
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:01,160
I am getting old,

678
00:42:01,815 --> 00:42:03,280
many things,

679
00:42:03,387 --> 00:42:06,880
more burdens  I want you to share.

680
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:08,040
All matters of the country,

681
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:09,880
your son will definitely not let go of.

682
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:11,840
Imperial Father, just give me the order.

683
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:19,480
4th Prince.  On  the 15th day

684
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:21,420
you will go to Tian'tan on my behalf.

685
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:23,180
Go respectfully fast

686
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:25,723
to perform the ceremony of Sacrifice to the Heavens.

687
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:30,080
I will do as ordered.

688
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:33,200
This matter was always taken care of by the Crown Prince.

689
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,440
It seems that the fourth brother

690
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:37,000
truly is the Emperor's favorite.

691
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:06,450
Your Highness.

692
00:43:08,347 --> 00:43:10,200
Is there anything wrong?

693
00:43:10,530 --> 00:43:12,740
Imperial Father ordered Prince to host the Sacrifice to the Heavens ceremony.

694
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:15,760
It seems the eunuchs have almost finished with preparations.

695
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:18,560
You can leave anytime for the temple.

696
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:20,760
Wait a little more.

697
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:22,920
Prince,

698
00:43:23,247 --> 00:43:25,660
any more delay and time will be tight.

699
00:43:25,660 --> 00:43:27,440
At this time

700
00:43:27,652 --> 00:43:29,120
I cannot leave.

701
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:33,520
Are you worried about the Emperor's sickness?

702
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:36,280
Prince, relax.

703
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:37,760
Please don't worry,

704
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:39,080
there definitely won't be any problems.

705
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,080
That's enough.

706
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:43,400
I have made my decision

707
00:43:44,779 --> 00:43:46,440
to wait.

708
00:43:57,766 --> 00:43:59,200
Emperor,

709
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:02,960
leave it for now.

710
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:04,825
Alright.

711
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:10,000
4th Prince

712
00:44:10,580 --> 00:44:13,640
I would like to say something to you.

713
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:16,640
Your son is listening.

714
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:21,520
I've served the empire and the people.

715
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:24,760
I know 4th Prince,

716
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:29,620
I know you are like me, caring for hearts.

717
00:44:29,620 --> 00:44:31,720
I have been listening to your advice since childhood,

718
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:34,360
Imperial Father has been my role model in everything.

719
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:40,480
You should know that...

720
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:44,320
what I most do not want to see

721
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:48,920
is you brothers, for the throne,

722
00:44:49,220 --> 00:44:51,520
plotting against each other,

723
00:44:52,220 --> 00:44:54,960
resulting in brothers hurting each other.

724
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:58,200
I do not have many days left.

725
00:44:58,200 --> 00:44:59,360
Imperial Father!  You have the most fortune!

726
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:00,960
You will live on for one hundred years!

727
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:03,080
I hope that you could for the Imperial Court,

728
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:09,540
strive to be the most... for my Qing Dynasty country.

729
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:18,120
I've already ordered... someone to write the decree.

730
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:22,751
Imperial Father! Imperial Father!

731
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:24,680
4th Prince...

732
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:27,640
You...

733
00:45:28,180 --> 00:45:31,460
You must promise me one thing.

734
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:04,040
Your son greets Imperial Mother.

735
00:46:38,020 --> 00:46:40,240
Go back for now.

736
00:46:40,980 --> 00:46:44,440
Rouxi, I have words to say to you.

737

♫  Stopping here, afraid to go any further ♫

739
00:46:54,770 --> 00:46:58,870

742

♫  We’ve walked down this path too hastily  ♫

743
00:47:20,860 --> 00:47:26,520
♫  Embracing desires that weren’t realistic  ♫

744
00:47:27,220 --> 00:47:32,650
♫  Not in time, wasn’t able to wait long enough to look back and admire  ♫

745

♫  The fragrance of magnolia is unable to hide wounds  ♫

746

♫  No longer looking for the paradise that we promised each other  ♫

748
00:47:51,810 --> 00:47:57,940
♫  No longer sighing, you once said that life is unpredictable  ♫
