Scarlet Heart
- Episode 6 -

3
00:02:15,933 --> 00:02:18,900
Second Miss, you've been moody for many days.

4
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:22,200
There's such a crowd today, why don't you be a little happier?

5
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,660
Second Miss, look!

6
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:27,633
Look at how beautiful that is!

7
00:02:27,633 --> 00:02:30,200
Hurry and look!

8
00:02:30,933 --> 00:02:33,333
It's so lively!

9
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:47,933
Thirteenth Prince.

10
00:02:47,933 --> 00:02:49,033
Please rise.

11
00:02:49,033 --> 00:02:50,033
How did such a coincidence occur?

12
00:02:50,033 --> 00:02:51,133
If one puts one's heart to it, coincidences will naturally occur.

13
00:02:51,133 --> 00:02:54,667
This road leads straight to Eighth Brother's estate, wouldn't it be only too easy to meet you?

14
00:02:54,667 --> 00:02:56,800
Then how did you know I was coming out tonight?

15
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,467
On such a nice day,

16
00:02:58,467 --> 00:03:00,600
don't tell me you were going to stay and sit around at home.

17
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,733
It was Qiaohui who dragged me out.

18
00:03:01,733 --> 00:03:03,200
I... I...

19
00:03:03,733 --> 00:03:05,600
Come, let's go take a look over there.

20
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,867
All right.

21
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,167
I invited Luwu out with me tonight.

22
00:03:16,167 --> 00:03:17,467
Miss Luwu is coming, too?

23
00:03:17,467 --> 00:03:20,000
That's great. The more the merrier.

24
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,267
See? I didn't lie to you, did I?

25
00:03:23,267 --> 00:03:24,867
It is truly as Thirteenth Prince has said.

26
00:03:24,867 --> 00:03:29,500
Miss Ruoxi is a genuine and straightforward person.

27
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,767
Miss Luwu.

28
00:03:31,767 --> 00:03:33,133
So it's actually a lady!

29
00:03:33,133 --> 00:03:34,733
No wonder "he" looks so delicate and pretty.

30
00:03:34,733 --> 00:03:37,100
Everyone, I know that there's a good restaurant ahead.

31
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:40,067
Let's have some good food and wine before we go to guess lantern riddles.

32
00:03:40,067 --> 00:03:40,900
Sure.

33
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,833
Let's go.

34
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:45,067
Sir, there are a lot of guests today.

35
00:03:45,067 --> 00:03:47,100
I'll bring you to a quiet corner.

36
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:49,900
Later, the lion and dragon dance performance will pass by downstairs.

37
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,567
If you sit here and watch,

38
00:03:51,567 --> 00:03:53,833
not only do you not have to squeeze in with the crowd, you'll also have a good view.

39
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:56,167
Great. Get us some good food to pair with the wine.

40
00:03:56,167 --> 00:03:57,800
Coming up!

41
00:03:59,267 --> 00:04:02,767
Thirteenth Brother, you're here, too?

42
00:04:03,067 --> 00:04:04,100
Greetings to Fourteenth Prince.

43
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:05,667
Thirteenth Prince.

44
00:04:05,667 --> 00:04:08,133
Rise, there's no need to carry on so much ceremony.

45
00:04:08,133 --> 00:04:10,433
That's right. We are all casually attired now.

46
00:04:10,433 --> 00:04:13,400
Why should there be so many rules? Have a seat.

47
00:04:20,367 --> 00:04:22,267
Isn't this Miss Luwu?

48
00:04:22,267 --> 00:04:26,900
Yes, but everyone says Miss Luwu from the capital is very lofty and aloof.

49
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:30,400
I find it strange, too. A courtesan is still a prostitute.
(A courtesan actually only offers their services as a performing artist and not their body)

50
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,700
Why does she look down on money?

51
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:33,367
That's right.

52
00:04:33,367 --> 00:04:35,800
Now I see that it's because she's the "female bosom friend" of Thirteenth Prince.

53
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,700
Several months ago, I met Miss Luwu.

54
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:40,502
The memory still lingers; it feels as if it was still yesterday.

55
00:04:40,502 --> 00:04:42,133
I can't get it out of my mind.

56
00:04:42,133 --> 00:04:45,800
Don't know when I can visit again, to continue where we left off.

57
00:04:48,733 --> 00:04:50,833
If the lot of you weren't following Fourteenth Prince,

58
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:53,567
I would have wondered where these street gangsters were from,

59
00:04:53,567 --> 00:04:57,433
to dare to speak so insolently in front of the two princes.

60
00:04:59,467 --> 00:05:00,733
Is this lady

61
00:05:00,733 --> 00:05:03,033
also a tantalizing character (prostitute)?

62
00:05:03,033 --> 00:05:06,567
Perhaps in the future, your reputation will be more widespread than Miss Luwu's.

63
00:05:06,567 --> 00:05:09,500
Thirteenth Prince truly is a casanova who knows not to waste his youth.

64
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,067
He has such good fortune with ladies.

65
00:05:11,067 --> 00:05:14,467
- He's really--
- Cha Lin, shut up.

66
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,067
Won't you hurry and apologize? That's General Maertai's daughter.

67
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:21,333
This lowly one didn't know. Please forgive my impudence.

68
00:05:23,867 --> 00:05:25,500
It's getting late.

69
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,333
Ruoxi should be getting home, too.

70
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:30,533
Thirteenth Brother, I'll drink with you another day.

71
00:05:30,533 --> 00:05:34,600
Sure, then I'll have to trouble you to send her home then.

72
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,000
No need to stand on ceremony.

73
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,600
That was my intention to start with.

74
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:44,300
Let's go.

75
00:06:01,767 --> 00:06:04,233
Farewell.

76
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,400
Luwu,

77
00:06:17,767 --> 00:06:20,733
I'll take you back.

78
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,600
So what if I was with Thirteenth Prince?

79
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,233
So what if I was with a prostitute?

80
00:06:25,233 --> 00:06:26,567
So what?

81
00:06:26,567 --> 00:06:28,133
In this Forbidden City,

82
00:06:28,133 --> 00:06:32,300
have you ever seen any lady of status associating with a prostitute?

83
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:35,500
I only know that Luzhu, who jumped to her death to prover her love, was a prostitute.

84
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,467
The heroine Liang Hongyu, who fought against the Jin invaders, was also a prostitute.

85
00:06:37,467 --> 00:06:40,067
Li Shishi, who refused to entertain the Jins and swallowed gold to commit suicide, was also a prostitute.

86
00:06:40,067 --> 00:06:41,967
Lin Siniang, who went all out to save Prince Heng, was also a prostitute.

87
00:06:41,967 --> 00:06:45,433
Yuan Bao'er, who sorrowfully sang as she breathed her last,  was also a prostitute.

88
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,133
All in all,

89
00:06:47,133 --> 00:06:48,900
a prostitute can be a good person as well

90
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,867
and there are many of them who deserve praise.

91
00:06:50,867 --> 00:06:52,600
How can you tar them all with the same brush?

92
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,633
Eighth Brother, listen to her.

93
00:06:54,633 --> 00:06:56,300
She sure knows how to study.

94
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:58,433
What rubbish has she been studying?

95
00:06:58,433 --> 00:06:59,400
What I study

96
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,967
is only the concern of my father and sister,

97
00:07:00,967 --> 00:07:04,000
you don't have any say in it.

98
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:10,167
All right. Stop arguing.

99
00:07:10,167 --> 00:07:12,700
Fourteenth Brother, head back first.

100
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:16,333
I will handle this matter with Ruoxi.

101
00:07:22,167 --> 00:07:24,867
That joking statement that the Crown Prince said was very apt after all.

102
00:07:24,867 --> 00:07:26,367
I think that

103
00:07:26,367 --> 00:07:29,167
not only are you just like Thirteenth Brother in that both of you go all out,

104
00:07:29,167 --> 00:07:31,033
but even how he looks up to the carefree and unfettered ideals of the Wei and Jin dynasties,

105
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:34,400
and his free-spirited ways.

106
00:07:34,933 --> 00:07:37,440
Don't stand anymore.

107
00:07:37,967 --> 00:07:39,933
Come here and sit.

108
00:07:40,033 --> 00:07:43,467
I have something to say to you.

109
00:07:54,533 --> 00:07:57,067
Are you scared?

110
00:07:57,367 --> 00:08:01,533
Are you scared about the maiden selections?

111
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:07,400
The selections are around the corner, but you are still so relaxed as to help defend others.

112
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:10,700
I can't tell if you're really scared or not.

113
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,400
Again with the selections.

114
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,900
Everyone's mentioning it.

115
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:16,967
But what else can I do?

116
00:08:16,967 --> 00:08:22,700
I can't hide or run from it. I can only sit and wait for it to happen.

117
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:31,467
The first time I met your sister,

118
00:08:31,467 --> 00:08:33,700
she was only fifteen.

119
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:36,900
That year, your father returned to the capital to report,

120
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:39,432
and she, too, followed him here.

121
00:08:39,633 --> 00:08:41,933
Just nice, it was spring.

122
00:08:41,933 --> 00:08:45,500
The weather was exceptionally fine.

123
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:50,340
That day, the sky was so blue, it looked as if it'd been washed with water.

124
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:56,459
The gentle breeze carried the fragrance of flowers, that blew into one's heart.

125
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,933
I was riding on the outskirts with two manservants.

126
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:03,567
In the distance,

127
00:09:03,567 --> 00:09:05,800
I saw a young lady

128
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:09,123
riding a horse on a hill.

129
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:15,900
You, too, have seen Ruolan's riding skills.

130
00:09:16,133 --> 00:09:18,000
That day, she rode

131
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,967
even better than she did in the horse riding grounds the other day.

132
00:09:20,967 --> 00:09:25,898
Her laughter was like silver bells ringing through the mountains and forests.

133
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:29,560
It was filled with joy,

134
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:32,972
making the heart of anyone who heard it fill with joy as well

135
00:09:32,972 --> 00:09:35,054
and laugh along with her.

136
00:09:35,054 --> 00:09:40,430
At that time, I couldn't believe at all what I was seeing.

137
00:09:40,952 --> 00:09:45,032
There are many beautiful ladies in the Forbidden City,

138
00:09:45,032 --> 00:09:49,200
but Ruolan was different.

139
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:52,439
At that time, Jiejie was a girl who was blissfully in love.

140
00:09:52,439 --> 00:09:56,147
She thought that she and the person she loved would be able to be together forever.

141
00:09:56,244 --> 00:09:59,080
Her happiness came from the bottom of her heart.

142
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:05,013
Of course, she was different from the ladies in the Forbidden City, who might never have experienced love in their lives before.

143
00:10:05,944 --> 00:10:07,841
It was Eighth Prince.

144
00:10:07,841 --> 00:10:12,506
He was the one who sent men to investigate the General.

145
00:10:12,647 --> 00:10:16,611
That's why Father sent him to be a frontline soldier.

146
00:10:16,611 --> 00:10:18,299
After I got back,

147
00:10:18,299 --> 00:10:20,435
I was busy trying to find out more about your sister.

148
00:10:20,435 --> 00:10:21,944
I also kept thinking

149
00:10:21,944 --> 00:10:25,734
of how I should go about pleading with Imperial Father so that he would gift her to me.

150
00:10:25,734 --> 00:10:28,019
Just when I was racking my brains trying to think of a way,

151
00:10:28,019 --> 00:10:29,637
Mother told me

152
00:10:29,637 --> 00:10:34,095
that Imperial Father wanted to betroth Maertai Family's eldest daughter to me to be my Cefujin.

153
00:10:34,095 --> 00:10:35,914
At that moment, I felt

154
00:10:35,914 --> 00:10:37,160
that in my whole life,

155
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:39,940
I had never been happier.

156
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:41,735
The day after Imperial Father made his decree,

157
00:10:41,735 --> 00:10:44,979
I combed the entire capital looking for a gift.

158
00:10:44,979 --> 00:10:46,983
I spent half a year

159
00:10:46,983 --> 00:10:49,583
before I found a Phoenix Blood Jade bangle,

160
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:53,341
and was going to present it to her on our wedding day.

161
00:10:56,481 --> 00:10:59,300
Is this the bangle?

162
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:14,168
The long-awaited wedding day finally arrived.

163
00:11:21,387 --> 00:11:22,966
But only when I

164
00:11:22,966 --> 00:11:25,913
lifted the red veil,

165
00:11:25,913 --> 00:11:28,275
did I realize

166
00:11:28,275 --> 00:11:31,647
that things weren't what I'd imagined them to be.

167
00:11:31,843 --> 00:11:35,023
The person who I'd pined for those two years

168
00:11:35,123 --> 00:11:37,602
and the person before me

169
00:11:37,602 --> 00:11:40,385
were two totally different people.

170
00:11:42,796 --> 00:11:45,758
She never rode,

171
00:11:46,193 --> 00:11:48,648
and seldom smiled.

172
00:11:48,648 --> 00:11:51,155
I kept asking myself what in the world had happened.

173
00:11:51,155 --> 00:11:54,210
Could it be that I mistook her for someone else?

174
00:11:55,163 --> 00:11:57,128
Later,

175
00:11:57,228 --> 00:12:00,186
I sent people to Xibei to find out what happened

176
00:12:00,286 --> 00:12:03,005
and after numerous twists and turns,

177
00:12:03,105 --> 00:12:06,891
I found out the reason.

178
00:12:07,742 --> 00:12:12,121
How did that person die?

179
00:12:22,735 --> 00:12:24,785
The people I sent to investigate

180
00:12:24,785 --> 00:12:26,589
alerted your father.

181
00:12:26,589 --> 00:12:28,632
In order to keep him hidden from them, your father

182
00:12:28,632 --> 00:12:31,080
sent him to the frontline.

183
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,873
And then...

184
00:12:38,183 --> 00:12:40,273
Don't take it off.

185
00:12:40,273 --> 00:12:42,030
This was for Jiejie.

186
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:44,867
It's for the person I like.

187
00:12:46,542 --> 00:12:48,732
Promise me

188
00:12:48,732 --> 00:12:52,343
that you will never take it off.

189
00:13:01,356 --> 00:13:03,082
Don't be scared.

190
00:13:03,082 --> 00:13:05,079
I'll think of a way.

191
00:13:05,079 --> 00:13:08,887
There has to be a way to let Imperial Father gift you to me.

192
00:13:08,887 --> 00:13:11,091
I don't want that.

193
00:13:11,091 --> 00:13:15,313
Would you rather be Imperial Father's woman?

194
00:13:29,213 --> 00:13:31,557
I won't force you.

195
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:34,904
It's up to you.

196
00:13:36,876 --> 00:13:39,776
You can go back.

197
00:13:42,156 --> 00:13:43,702
After you enter the palace,

198
00:13:43,702 --> 00:13:48,275
don't dress yourself up the way you did on Tenth Brother's birthday.

199
00:13:49,229 --> 00:13:52,108
If you don't want to arouse Imperial Father's attention,

200
00:13:52,108 --> 00:13:55,055
then the plainer you are, the better.

201
00:13:59,346 --> 00:14:00,932
I don't want that.

202
00:14:00,932 --> 00:14:03,161
I don't want any of that.

203
00:14:03,161 --> 00:14:06,412
I just want to find someone who truly loves and treasures me.

204
00:14:06,412 --> 00:14:09,562
I don't want to be just some woman a man dallies with in his leisure.

205
00:14:09,562 --> 00:14:12,177
I'm a person, not a thing.

206
00:14:12,177 --> 00:14:15,742
I don't want to be gifted around.

207
00:14:19,501 --> 00:14:22,480
This shop is very famous in the capital.

208
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,134
It'd be best if we could buy everything in one go.

209
00:14:25,134 --> 00:14:27,881
This way, we won't have to go to another shop.

210
00:14:27,881 --> 00:14:31,682
Jiejie, you said that for every shop we visited. This is already the fourth shop.

211
00:14:31,682 --> 00:14:34,415
These are things we need to prepare for when you enter the palace.

212
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:37,501
I'm not tired yet, and you're already tired?

213
00:14:37,944 --> 00:14:41,056
Besides, the palace is not like home.

214
00:14:41,056 --> 00:14:43,252
Shouldn't you buy everything that you should buy,

215
00:14:43,252 --> 00:14:45,753
so as to prepare for a time when you might need them?

216
00:14:45,753 --> 00:14:47,997
It's here, it's here.

217
00:14:48,347 --> 00:14:51,840
Have a good look. Look at how intricate these accessories are.

218
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:55,248
These are the best top-grade items in our shop.

219
00:14:55,248 --> 00:14:58,074
What kind of top-grade items are they?

220
00:15:01,932 --> 00:15:04,276
Greetings to Difujin.

221
00:15:04,276 --> 00:15:06,726
Greetings to Tenth Fujin.

222
00:15:08,734 --> 00:15:11,010
This pair of earrings... Jiejie, look.

223
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:13,506
What do you think?

224
00:15:14,396 --> 00:15:16,071
They are top-grade indeed.

225
00:15:16,071 --> 00:15:19,297
Jiejie, since young you've seen treasures of all sorts, your judgement definitely will not go wrong.

226
00:15:19,972 --> 00:15:22,380
Boss, I want this pair of earrings.

227
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:24,507
If you don't want to arouse Imperial Father's attention,

228
00:15:24,507 --> 00:15:27,446
then the plainer you are, the better.

229
00:15:28,524 --> 00:15:32,422
This pair of earrings really suits you.

230
00:15:34,576 --> 00:15:39,545
Jiejie, this shop's accessories are too glamorous. Let's go to another shop instead.

231
00:15:49,044 --> 00:15:50,435
What are you laughing about?

232
00:15:50,435 --> 00:15:51,830
Whatever Madam is happy about,

233
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:54,474
that's what I'm laughing about.

234
00:15:55,174 --> 00:15:58,671
My Ruoxi is finally turning sensible.

235
00:15:58,671 --> 00:16:01,912
In the palace, bossy people like them are aplenty.

236
00:16:01,912 --> 00:16:03,440
I must learn to be tolerant.

237
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,484
It's best that you think that way.

238
00:16:05,484 --> 00:16:08,920
Don't worry, Jiejie. I will look after myself in the palace.

239
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:12,585
I definitely won't create trouble for you or Father.

240
00:16:13,332 --> 00:16:16,868
There are a few more shops over there. Why don't we go take a look?

241
00:16:16,868 --> 00:16:18,162
Jiejie!

242
00:16:18,162 --> 00:16:21,466
Don't tell me you want to buy the entire capital for me to bring to the Forbidden City (palace)?

243
00:16:21,466 --> 00:16:25,381
All right. We'll go home.

244
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:28,180
What is wrong with that Ruoxi today?

245
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:30,300
She didn't even fight with me over the accessories.

246
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:32,740
"Go-All-Out Thirteenth Sister" doesn't go all out anymore.

247
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:36,180
Who knows what she's up to again.

248
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:40,760
That face of hers is endearing to others,

249
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,460
just like her sister.

250
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:43,900
Why would she care

251
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:45,820
about a mere accessory?

252
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:47,000
Jiejie,

253
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,960
you're a person with pride.

254
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,360
But why is it that the moment those sisters are mentioned,

255
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,520
you'll have an inferiority complex.

256
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:59,140
I'm complimenting her. She's intelligent and prudent. She's outstanding in the things she does,

257
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:01,260
but also knows not to go overboard.

258
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:04,020
This kind of person is the most endearing to others.

259
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:05,780
If this time,

260
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:08,340
Imperial Father takes a shine to her,

261
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:10,460
I'm afraid that her status will be vastly different.

262
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:12,019
Even Ruolan,

263
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:17,019
will be elevated in status and stand on par with me.

264
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:33,940
Jiejie,

265
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:36,060
the both of us will still be in the capital.

266
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:38,020
It's not like we're on opposite sides of the world.

267
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,740
Even though we are only separated by the palace walls,

268
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:45,380
it's not like we can meet whenever we want to.

269
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:47,540
Jiejie,

270
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:49,700
a few days ago,

271
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:51,640
Eighth Prince told me some things,

272
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,500
all of which were pertaining to you.

273
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:57,500
Actually, he saw you before you got married.

274
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:01,420
He saw how suave you were on a horse and fell in love at first sight.

275
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:03,060
During my stay here,

276
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:05,820
even though everyone says that you're not favored,

277
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:08,900
I've never seen Eighth Prince not treat you well.

278
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:10,420
As for your daily needs, I've also never seen you--

279
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:12,900
Don't say anymore.

280
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:16,540
Although we may have the affinity to be husband and wife,

281
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:19,300
it's impossible for there to be affection between us.

282
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:24,060
Mistress, Bei'le is here.

283
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:29,840
Greetings to Bei'le.

284
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,580
Everyone, please rise.

285
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:35,100
There's no need for you to worry too much.

286
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:36,780
For matters which I've given my word,

287
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:38,460
I'll naturally do my best to get them done.

288
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:40,660
Thank you, Bei`le.

289
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:46,460
I have already instructed Li Fu to send Ruoxi to the palace.

290
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:51,940
It's getting late, it's time she left.

291
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,420
Go.

292
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:32,900
Second Miss.

293
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,900
Don't be scared.

294
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:01,500
I'll take care of everything for you.

295
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:04,020
I definitely won't let you get bullied.

296
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,180
Ladies,

297
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:34,500
this humble servant is the Head Eunuch who is in-charge of the Emperor's well-being,

298
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,180
Li Dequan.

299
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:38,100
Greetings to Eunuch Li.

300
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:40,980
All of you maidens, who are awaiting the selection,

301
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:43,960
whether you'll have the fortune to be selected as a concubine in the future,

302
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,740
or become a palace maid,

303
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:48,620
you are all serving our Emperor.

304
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,900
While you're living in the palace,

305
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:53,140
just bear in mind these four words:

306
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:55,380
"Careful words. Prudent actions."

307
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:56,980
I repeat these words

308
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:59,580
every three years.

309
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:01,980
But those who really heed them

310
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:03,580
are quite few in number.

311
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:06,140
I hope that you will not disappoint me.

312
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:07,860
Yes.

313
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:09,120
From now on,

314
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:12,940
you will have to learn and assist with all palace affairs.

315
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:16,660
Those who aren't selected to become concubines will still have to serve as palace maids

316
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:19,860
until they are age 20 to 24 in years

317
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:22,060
and get the Emperor's permission,

318
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:25,900
only then will they be sent out of the palace and have their marriage arranged with another person.

319
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:32,260
From now on, the Head-in-Charge will guide you in the rules and affairs of this palace.

320
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:33,540
Remember,

321
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:38,420
learn more and do more, but talk less and listen (eavesdrop) less.

322
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,040
I'll leave them to you now.

323
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:43,060
Please don't worry, Eunuch Li.

324
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:48,800
Which family are you from?

325
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,780
Who knows how long we'll be stuck here for.

326
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:53,500
I don't want to be serving tea and drawing water every day.

327
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,980
Enough.

328
00:21:57,820 --> 00:21:59,820
We just talked about being careful with your words and actions,

329
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:01,480
and you immediately forget it.

330
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:03,580
Rest well today.

331
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:05,900
Tomorrow, I will assign you tasks.

332
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:08,380
From today onward, you are people who will serve masters.

333
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:10,980
Remember to be extra, extra careful.

334
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:12,580
Yes.

335
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:14,340
You are all dismissed now.

336
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:19,880
The palace is not like the outside world.

337
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,380
There are people watching from every corner.

338
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:24,100
Just be careful in everything.

339
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:25,900
I'll definitely take good care of you.

340
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,660
Thank you for your advice.

341
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:38,060
Ruoxi, you must do your best.

342
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:40,340
You mustn't let down all the care Eighth Prince gave.

343
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:42,420
In the future, in this palace,

344
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:44,740
I can only depend on myself.

345
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,420
Princes, farewell.

346
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:00,020
Farewell.

347
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:02,120
Eighth Prince, Fourteenth Prince, no need to see me out. This lowly official bids you farewell.

348
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:04,220
- Farewell.
- Farewell.

349
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:07,460
Eighth Brother,

350
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:09,580
is there something you want to tell me?

351
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:11,780
Yes.

352
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:13,020
There's one matter

353
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:15,140
that I require you to help me with.

354
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:16,700
Why are you being so polite with me?

355
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:19,780
Whatever you need me to help you with, just ask.

356
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,780
Then I shan't beat around the bush.

357
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:23,220
Regarding the maiden selection this time,

358
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:25,300
I hope you can ask Concubine De (Fourteenth Prince's mother)

359
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:27,100
to plead a favor from the Empress

360
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:30,620
to remove Ruoxi's name from the list of preliminary selections.

361
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:33,940
You know as well,

362
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:35,260
that given my mother's status,

363
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:36,620
even if she would like to help,

364
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:37,660
she's still powerless to do anything.

365
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:39,180
Since you've already asked me,

366
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:41,920
as your younger brother, I naturally won't refuse.

367
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,580
But I want to know

368
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:46,260
whether you're doing this for Ruoxi

369
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:48,560
or for my future sister-in-law?

370
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:51,100
You have to make this clear.

371
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:53,860
It's true that I want to marry her,

372
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:56,100
but she has to be willing as well.

373
00:23:56,100 --> 00:24:00,420
Then for the sake of my future sister-in-law, I'll definitely do my best.

374
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:04,580
Ruoxi is still considered a concubine-to-be.

375
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:06,020
Don't do it too obviously.

376
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:09,380
I understand, Eighth Brother.  Don't worry.

377
00:24:32,467 --> 00:24:33,860
Mother.

378
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:34,980
Master.

379
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,700
You are dismissed.

380
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:40,860
It's been so long since you last visited me.

381
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:42,620
Here, come and sit here.

382
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:45,540
Mother, I came here today, because

383
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:47,889
there's something I would like to ask you to help me with.

384
00:24:47,889 --> 00:24:50,340
You have something to ask from me, too?

385
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:52,047
What a coincidence!

386
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:54,840
What is it? Tell me.

387
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:56,598
Regarding Eighth Brother's sister-in-law, Ruoxi,

388
00:24:56,598 --> 00:24:58,140
being in the maiden selection.

389
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:01,340
You two brothers

390
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:04,540
are asking and pleading on behalf of the same person?

391
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:08,060
Is she the one your Imperial Father

392
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:11,420
praised at the last family feast?

393
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,700
How strange. You two brothers

394
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:18,620
are always so distant with each other.

395
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:22,340
Seeing you fellows like that, I feel really sad.

396
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:23,765
But today, you two are

397
00:25:23,765 --> 00:25:25,716
asking for a favor for the same person.

398
00:25:25,716 --> 00:25:28,180
How rare.

399
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:29,988
What's so special

400
00:25:29,988 --> 00:25:32,203
about this Ruoxi

401
00:25:32,203 --> 00:25:34,840
that you both would plead for her?

402
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:36,780
Actually, there's nothing really special as well.

403
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:38,060
It's just that usually,

404
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:39,460
we occasionally have gatherings together.

405
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:42,300
Ruoxi is a straightforward girl

406
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:44,180
and doesn't want to be chosen as a concubine.

407
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:46,900
I think it's just as well,

408
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:48,660
lest when facing Imperial Father,

409
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:50,740
she accidentally does the wrong thing and loses her head.

410
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:52,620
Which is why I'm here to plead with you

411
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:55,580
to take her out of the list of preliminary selections.

412
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:58,131
That's not difficult.

413
00:25:58,131 --> 00:26:01,010
What is rare, is that you two brothers

414
00:26:01,010 --> 00:26:04,261
are wanting the same thing for the first time.

415
00:26:04,261 --> 00:26:06,100
This favor...

416
00:26:06,801 --> 00:26:08,180
I'll help you.

417
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:10,420
You dote on me the most.

418
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:13,780
Look how happy you are.

419
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:16,380
Don't tell me you've fallen for this Ruoxi?

420
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:19,060
No way, Mother.

421
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:21,140
Fourth Brother is still here.

422
00:26:22,347 --> 00:26:23,866
Mother,

423
00:26:23,866 --> 00:26:25,902
since you want to help her, why not do it all the way?

424
00:26:25,902 --> 00:26:29,340
Why don't you have Ruoxi transferred here to wait on you?

425
00:26:29,814 --> 00:26:31,150
Right, right.

426
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:33,100
What Fourth Brother said makes sense.

427
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,580
All right.

428
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:37,780
Whatever you say.

429
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:39,720
Anyway, I'm lacking a maid

430
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:43,300
who's intelligent and meticulous.

431
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:44,860
As long as you brothers

432
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:47,580
become closer and more unified from now on,

433
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:49,900
I will be very happy.

434
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:52,210
- Yes, Mother.
- Understood.

435
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:02,784
Fourth Brother, your coming here today

436
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:05,500
was because Thirteenth Brother asked you to, right?

437
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:07,900
Since he asked,

438
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:10,620
it was as simple as lifting a finger.

439
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,040
What about you?

440
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:15,105
On whose behalf are you here for?

441
00:27:15,105 --> 00:27:16,870
I'm good friends with Ruoxi.

442
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:17,977
Whether she's willing to or not,

443
00:27:17,977 --> 00:27:19,820
I will still help her.

444
00:27:34,192 --> 00:27:36,900
Mother, how was it?

445
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:44,820
Ruoxi has already been taken off the list of selected concubine candidates.

446
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:48,720
Here.

447
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,280
That's great.

448
00:27:54,014 --> 00:27:55,422
If that's the case,

449
00:27:55,422 --> 00:27:57,033
why do you still sigh, Mother?

450
00:27:57,033 --> 00:27:58,812
I just never thought that

451
00:27:58,812 --> 00:28:01,880
both Concubine Hui and Concubine De would vie for her.

452
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:04,896
The Empress didn't want to reject both sides.

453
00:28:04,896 --> 00:28:06,521
So after due consideration,

454
00:28:06,521 --> 00:28:09,611
she was assigned to the Emperor's side to be a tea-serving palace maid.

455
00:28:09,611 --> 00:28:11,600
Imperial Father's side?

456
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:16,880
Why would Concubine Hui insist on wanting Ruoxi?

457
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:22,080
I tried asking about it, too. Apparently...

458
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:26,258
Apparently, Minghui previously went to look for Concubine Hui.

459
00:28:43,552 --> 00:28:45,298
Greetings to Eighth Prince.

460
00:28:45,298 --> 00:28:47,063
Rise.

461
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:50,280
Your name

462
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:52,960
has already been removed from the list of preliminary selections.

463
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:56,320
There's no more chance of you getting selected as a concubine.

464
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,080
Is something wrong?

465
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:06,120
Concubine Hui and Concubine De requested you at the same time.

466
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:08,560
In order to avoid offending either of them, the Empress

467
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:11,421
arranged for you to be sent to Imperial Father's side

468
00:29:11,421 --> 00:29:13,441
as a tea-serving palace maid.

469
00:29:15,131 --> 00:29:16,599
Ruoxi,

470
00:29:17,353 --> 00:29:20,200
the moment you are assigned to serve by Imperial Father's side,

471
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,440
it'll be very hard for you to ever leave the palace again.

472
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,960
I'm sorry.

473
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:27,960
This is already the best outcome given the circumstances.

474
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,640
There's no need for you to blame yourself.

475
00:29:30,015 --> 00:29:32,458
Even though I'm not exceptionally talented,

476
00:29:32,458 --> 00:29:34,223
an errand like serving tea,

477
00:29:34,223 --> 00:29:36,520
is not something I won't be able to learn.

478
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:38,588
In the future, if I want to see you,

479
00:29:39,374 --> 00:29:41,607
it'll be even harder.

480
00:29:53,010 --> 00:29:54,563
Wait for me.

481
00:29:54,999 --> 00:29:58,650
I will definitely find an opportunity to get you out of the palace.

482
00:29:58,650 --> 00:30:00,461
In front of Imperial Father,

483
00:30:00,461 --> 00:30:02,551
you have to be alert in everything you do.

484
00:30:02,551 --> 00:30:04,827
If you run into any difficulties,

485
00:30:04,827 --> 00:30:07,381
I'll do my best to help you.

486
00:30:07,381 --> 00:30:08,960
In any case,

487
00:30:09,542 --> 00:30:12,954
I'll make the best out of it.

488
00:30:48,902 --> 00:30:50,602
Have snacks prepared.

489
00:30:50,602 --> 00:30:53,800
When His Majesty is hungry, send it over immediately.

490
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:58,200
He has already pulled several consecutive all-nighters.

491
00:31:08,056 --> 00:31:11,547
Your Majesty, it's time to rest.

492
00:31:11,547 --> 00:31:13,743
Why don't you work on the petitions tomorrow?

493
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:29,160
Your Majesty, please forgive me.

494
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:37,799
I thought I was seeing Tenth Princess.

495
00:31:37,799 --> 00:31:39,053
Before she got married,

496
00:31:39,053 --> 00:31:42,120
that was how she nagged at me to rest, too.

497
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:44,347
Get up.

498
00:31:44,347 --> 00:31:46,191
Thank you, Your Majesty.

499
00:31:46,191 --> 00:31:47,923
Thank you, Your Majesty.

500
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:49,434
Li Dequan.

501
00:31:49,434 --> 00:31:50,361
Your Majesty.

502
00:31:50,361 --> 00:31:53,241
Keep these and prepare me for bed.

503
00:31:53,241 --> 00:31:54,440
Yes.

504
00:32:04,017 --> 00:32:05,756
Looking at you this way,

505
00:32:05,756 --> 00:32:09,160
you really do look like the "Go-All-Out Thirteenth Sister."

506
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,431
Careful words. Prudent actions.

507
00:32:36,176 --> 00:32:39,588
When will I be able to accomplish that?

508
00:32:41,603 --> 00:32:43,419
Miss Ruoxi.

509
00:32:47,159 --> 00:32:48,620
Eunuch Li.

510
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:50,680
Last night's matter

511
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:53,520
has really caused me to see you in a whole new light.

512
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:56,400
You are really a bringer of good fortune.

513
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,839
You praise me too much, Eunuch Li.

514
00:32:57,839 --> 00:32:59,650
Last night, I was just in luck.

515
00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:01,625
Thinking back on it, I still break out in a cold sweat,

516
00:33:01,625 --> 00:33:03,179
and still get very scared.

517
00:33:03,179 --> 00:33:04,619
Don't be modest, Miss.

518
00:33:04,619 --> 00:33:05,991
Shifu never compliments people,
(Shifu - teacher or master)

519
00:33:05,991 --> 00:33:08,752
even me, I only get scolded all the time.

520
00:33:13,785 --> 00:33:15,764
Actually, it's not just last night,

521
00:33:15,764 --> 00:33:17,654
I've been observing you for a long time.

522
00:33:17,654 --> 00:33:20,324
You're alert in what you do, and handle matters with care,

523
00:33:20,324 --> 00:33:21,732
and you don't gossip either.

524
00:33:21,732 --> 00:33:24,358
Added to that "Go-All-Out" bravery you have,

525
00:33:24,358 --> 00:33:28,119
you're really suited to serve by the Emperor's side.

526
00:33:28,119 --> 00:33:30,927
Yutan, Yunxiang, both of you come in.

527
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:35,680
From now on, both of you will serve under

528
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:38,640
Miss Ruoxi as her personal assistants.

529
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,520
Learn well from her,

530
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:42,880
so I don't need to worry in the future.

531
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:46,440
Yes. Your servants give their greetings to Miss Ruoxi.

532
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:48,520
All right. It's time I went back now, too.

533
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:03,640
Which of you is Yutan?

534
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:04,960
Which of you is Yunxiang?

535
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,000
This servant of yours is Yutan.

536
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:09,240
This servant of yours is Yunxiang.

537
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:10,200
Enough, enough.

538
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:11,000
There's no one else here.

539
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,120
It's just us three.

540
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:13,720
There's no need to refer yourself as servants.

541
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:15,519
In the future, let's just call each other directly by each other's names.

542
00:34:15,519 --> 00:34:17,239
Your servants do not dare.

543
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:21,719
In the future, I'll definitely find a way to get you to change.

544
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:23,960
Miss Ruoxi.

545
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:32,880
Why don't you both go outside and collect the dried tea leaves.

546
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:34,560
Yes.

547
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,060
Miss Ruoxi,

548
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:40,040
Eighth Prince told me to give this to you.

549
00:34:42,939 --> 00:34:44,760
Your servant takes his leave.

550
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,960
Ruoxi was highly commended

551
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,480
and is now serving beside the Emperor.

552
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,760
After a few years, when I find a chance,

553
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,280
I'll take her out of the palace.

554
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:04,480
Thank you Bei'le for taking care of her.

555
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:12,160
Greetings to Bei'le and Cefujin.

556
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:14,720
What's come up?

557
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:18,820
Difujin asks for you to visit her place.

558
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:22,820
Tell her that I have been busy with work lately,

559
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:26,280
and don't have the time. Let us talk about it again another day.

560
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:29,320
Your servant takes her leave.

561
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:52,460
When Concubine De couldn't manage to have Ruoxi assigned to her,

562
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:55,200
I truly worried about her.

563
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,840
Who'd have thought that she'd be so fortunate

564
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,940
to have already become the Head Tea-server in such a short time.

565
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:02,880
She's really not someone you can underestimate.

566
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:05,580
If you have the energy to think about such trivial matters,

567
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:08,140
why don't you think of caring more for the Crown Prince?

568
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:10,400
He's been acting increasingly out of the line these past two years,

569
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,640
I'm afraid that something big will happen sooner or later.

570
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:13,920
No matter how overboard I get,

571
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,940
all I do is visit brothels occasionally to drink.

572
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:17,260
But the Crown Prince on the other hand,

573
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:20,681
relying on how Imperial Father dotes on him, he's been arrogant and wilful, and throws his weight around.

574
00:37:20,681 --> 00:37:23,520
Especially recently, he doesn't pay any regard to the consequences of his actions.

575
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,280
Everyone says that I'm the "Go-All-Out Thirteenth Brother,"

576
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:28,680
but I think I lose out to him completely.

577
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:30,460
But Fourth Brother,

578
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:32,220
it's no use for us to worry so much.

579
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:34,840
Let's just wait and see.

580
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:39,280
By the way, Fourth Brother,

581
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:41,700
your favorite tea is...

582
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:43,500
Taiping Houkui.

583
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:45,280
Then what about your favourite snack?

584
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,780
Yukou pastry.

585
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:49,080
Taiping Houkui, Yukou pastry.

586
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:52,560
What's your favourite color?

587
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:55,440
Why are you asking me all this?

588
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,780
It's nothing.

589
00:37:56,780 --> 00:38:00,020
It's just that I've hung out with you for so long,

590
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:01,100
I still don't know.

591
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:04,200
Just thought to ask since it came to mind.

592
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:13,220
From now on, serve the Emperor and the princes tea according to their preferences.

593
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:15,340
Fourth Prince likes Taiping Houkui;

594
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:17,540
Eighth Prince likes Rizhu Xueya;

595
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:19,460
Ninth Prince likes Yuqian Longjing,

596
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:21,320
and anything goes for Tenth Prince. Thirteenth Prince--

597
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:24,260
Jiejie! Jiejie!

598
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:26,100
Jiejie, the Emperor has ended court.
(Traditionally, Emperors held court every morning with all officials to discuss matters of the country)

599
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:28,700
So what if he's ended court? Why are you in such a fluster?

600
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:30,860
Careful you don't get seen by your Shifu like this or you'll get scolded again.

601
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:32,480
This morning in court,

602
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:34,760
someone lodged a complaint about the Crown Prince.

603
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:35,900
What did you say?

604
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:37,380
It was Shifu who sent me here.

605
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:39,660
He asked for you to be mindful when you wait on the Emperor today.

606
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:42,480
Help me to thank your Shifu.

607
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:44,400
Did you hear what was said?

608
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,700
Make sure you're extra alert and be careful when serving later.

609
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:48,440
Yes.

610
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:52,660
Even though the Crown Prince isn't outstanding in both character and abilities,

611
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:55,900
he was personally raised by His Majesty and he dotes on him a lot.

612
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:58,221
To have the son he loves most let him down the most,

613
00:38:58,221 --> 00:39:02,720
the Emperor is the one who will feel most pained about it.

614
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:15,240
What do you fellows think about

615
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:19,760
the complaint lodged by the Ministry of Rites in court this morning?

616
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:29,520
In my opinion,

617
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:32,380
the Crown Prince has always treated his servants very generously.

618
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:33,900
But there are folks who have no shame,

619
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:36,340
and use the Crown Prince's name

620
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:38,640
for their own monetary gain.

621
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:41,380
Even if you were to give a servant all the guts in the world,

622
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:43,460
if there wasn't anyone backing him up,

623
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:46,480
would he dare take tribute anyhow that was meant to be given to Imperial Father.

624
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:50,240
Fourth Brother, what a strange thing you said.

625
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:53,320
Idiot! Daring to go against the future emperor.

626
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:54,760
Are you seeking to die?

627
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:57,800
But Fourth Brother and Second Brother (Crown Prince) have always been close.

628
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:00,080
Perhaps, regarding this issue, Fourth Brother...

629
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:04,880
- You!
- Your servant deserves to die.

630
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,700
Your servant deserves to die.

631
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:09,320
Tenth Prince, are you all right?

632
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:10,900
No worries. No worries.

633
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:12,080
It's nothing serious.

634
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,040
What are you doing?

635
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,980
So clumsy! You're dismissed!

636
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:17,000
Yes.

637
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:29,780
Jiejie, what happened today?

638
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:31,660
You won't get into any trouble will you?

639
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:34,480
Don't worry. The Emperor is a wise ruler,

640
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:37,000
and has always been merciful toward the servants.

641
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,060
Although, even if I have to receive beatings for it,

642
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:43,000
it'd all be worth it.

643
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:47,980
Eunuch Li.

644
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:50,440
Yutan, Yunxiang, you may both leave.

645
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:52,080
Yes.

646
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:58,620
You've always been a careful person,

647
00:40:58,620 --> 00:41:01,060
why were you so careless today?

648
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:02,980
Please punish me, Eunuch Li.

649
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:05,840
Your entire salary for next month will be forfeited.

650
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,580
Thank you, Eunuch Li.

651
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:10,820
The palace cannot house so many kind-hearted people.

652
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:14,180
If you're a busybody again,

653
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:18,320
the thing you might lose, might be your head instead.

654
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,180
Ruoxi!

655
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:44,180
Why do you look so pale?

656
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:45,600
What's wrong with you?

657
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:46,920
I haven't even blamed you for scalding me

658
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:48,920
and you're showing me attitude instead?

659
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:51,360
I've had one month's salary forfeited.

660
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:54,160
You're already so upset

661
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:55,560
over just one month's worth of salary?

662
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:56,840
Why shouldn't I be upset?

663
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:59,020
You might not care about that bit of salary,

664
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:00,980
but I was relying on that money.

665
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:03,460
Furthermore, I have never been punished before.

666
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:07,340
I'm the leading lady officer, this is so embarrassing.

667
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:08,700
All right, all right.

668
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:10,240
Isn't it just one month's salary?

669
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:12,240
Whatever you want,

670
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:14,320
I'll bring it in for you.

671
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:19,080
Just give me whatever you want to give me.

672
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:21,720
I won't be angry with you anymore.

673
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:25,280
Fourth Brother,

674
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:29,600
this time, Ruoxi spilled the tea at just the right moment.

675
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:33,200
Tenth Brother brought it onto himself to get scalded.

676
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:35,640
He doesn't know when or how to hold his tongue

677
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:38,200
and almost got Fourth Brother into trouble.

678
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:40,800
Among us brothers, we should watch out for one another,

679
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,660
what more since that person is the Crown Prince.

680
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:43,860
You're absolutely right.

681
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:47,320
The Crown Prince is so fortunate to have Fourth Brother watching out for him.

682
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:50,920
Don't forget Ruoxi, this lucky star.

683
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:54,460
Let's go! Why are you still chit-chatting over there?

684
00:42:54,460 --> 00:42:58,080
Coming! I'll be leaving now.

685
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:06,240
What exactly are your intentions towards Eighth Brother?

686
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:08,280
Just now, I clearly saw

687
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:10,660
that you purposely poured tea on Tenth Brother.

688
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:12,460
Why are you helping Fourth Brother?

689
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:13,840
It's not at all what you think.

690
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:16,160
Whether you did it on purpose or accidentally,

691
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:17,820
Eighth Brother's feelings for you are sincere.

692
00:43:17,820 --> 00:43:19,560
You know it in your heart.

693
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:24,200
If you like Eighth Brother as well, then don't let him down.

694
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:30,420
I just wanted to help Tenth Prince, I didn't expect to create such a misunderstanding.

695
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:32,280
Will he misunderstand me?

696
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:36,960
Since entering the palace, Fourth Prince and I haven't even spoken a word.

697
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:40,420
There's no way he will misunderstand.

698
00:43:55,980 --> 00:43:59,280
Why are you refusing to see me?

699
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:02,120
If it's because of the matter with Ruoxi,

700
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:05,840
I'll admit, I went to look for Concubine Hui.

701
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:08,640
I did it to beg her to to accept Ruoxi

702
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:12,120
so that the Emperor wouldn't be able to pick her as his concubine.

703
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:16,880
I did it for Ruoxi's happiness.

704
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:20,800
You were just afraid that if Ruoxi became an Imperial Concubine, her sister would receive a corresponding elevation in status

705
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:23,320
and your status as Fujin would be threatened.

706
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:25,160
If you hadn't been so selfish and acted on your own accord,

707
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:26,540
Ruoxi would have been out of the palace by now,

708
00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:29,960
instead of having to serve by the Emperor's side.

709
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:32,140
I don't want to quarrel with you.

710
00:44:32,140 --> 00:44:33,240
From now on,

711
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:36,240
don't come looking for me without permission.

712
00:44:52,420 --> 00:44:55,280
Ice Cube Face?

713
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:59,280
Greetings to Fourth Prince.

714
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:17,280
Taiping Houkui, Yukou pastry,

715
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:19,420
post-rain blue skies,

716
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:22,220
white china painted with flowers and butterflies,

717
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:27,720
likes dogs, hates cats, hates chili and dislikes drinking wine.

718
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:30,500
Thirteenth Brother has already told you all this, hasn't he?

719
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:33,340
This Thirteenth Prince, I just asked you to find out his preferences and you still managed to give me away.

720
00:45:33,340 --> 00:45:35,160
I've really got to hand it to you.

721
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:37,000
In the future, if you have any questions,

722
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,780
just come and ask me directly.

723
00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:40,380
You can ask me now.

724
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:44,080
Since you're asking for it, it'd be a waste for me not to ask.

725
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:46,640
There's nothing to lose.

726
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:50,560
What color do you hate most?

727
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:51,460
Black.

728
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:53,580
What incense do you hate most?

729
00:45:53,580 --> 00:45:54,840
Gardenia.

730
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:56,780
What's your favorite flower?

731
00:45:56,780 --> 00:45:57,900
Water Magnolia.

732
00:45:57,900 --> 00:45:59,320
What's your favorite fruit?

733
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:01,760
Grapes.

734
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:06,760
What weather makes you the happiest?

735
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:09,160
Light drizzle.

736
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:12,040
Then what weather do you hate the most?

737
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:14,760
Scorching hot days.

738
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:17,180
That's because you're an ice cube.

739
00:46:17,180 --> 00:46:18,720
What head (cube)?

740
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:19,720
Do you like ice cubes?

741
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:20,480
Yes.

742
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:21,274
What book do you like?

743
00:46:21,274 --> 00:46:22,164
Diamond Sutra.

744
00:46:22,164 --> 00:46:23,160
What are you most afraid of?

745
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:24,060
A woman crying.

746
00:46:24,060 --> 00:46:25,360
What do you like to do the most?

747
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:26,260
Calligraphy.

748
00:46:26,260 --> 00:46:27,400
What do you play?

749
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:29,680
I don't play.

750
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:30,900
What poems do you like?

751
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:32,200
Wang Wei's poems.

752
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:33,520
How about types of song?

753
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:36,720
Pass.

754
00:46:51,880 --> 00:47:25,560
