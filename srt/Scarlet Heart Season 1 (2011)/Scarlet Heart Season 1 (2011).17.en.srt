00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:24,540
♫  We were destined to seek our doom like moths flying towards the flame  ♫

♫  Only like this can I not be in love with you  ♫

7
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:48,170
♫  Just another brushing of the shoulder, and from then...♫

8
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:53,360
♫  I’ll keep falling deeper and deeper in love with you  ♫

9
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:58,100

Scarlet Heart
Episode 17

24
00:02:03,504 --> 00:02:04,818
See. Come over here.

25
00:02:04,818 --> 00:02:06,397
Pals.

26
00:02:06,397 --> 00:02:09,277
Let's drink a toast to 9th Prince.
He made it through safely. Come and have a drink.

27
00:02:09,277 --> 00:02:11,211
Come on. Have a drink. Congratulations, 9th Prince.

28
00:02:11,211 --> 00:02:13,097
What is there to celebrate?

29
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:16,651
9th Prince.

30
00:02:16,651 --> 00:02:18,623
What are you angry about?

31
00:02:18,623 --> 00:02:22,217
There's an old saying, "A gentleman can wait 10 years for his revenge."

32
00:02:22,217 --> 00:02:23,146
That's right.

33
00:02:23,146 --> 00:02:24,786
Missy, what do you need?

34
00:02:24,786 --> 00:02:28,547
- Sir, please give me a jar of wine.
- Alright.

35
00:02:32,915 --> 00:02:38,137
I think you don't have to wait for 10 years, you can have your revenge now.

36
00:02:38,137 --> 00:02:38,736
This...

37
00:02:38,736 --> 00:02:39,739
Look.

38
00:02:41,297 --> 00:02:44,037
That lady is close to 13th Prince.

39
00:02:44,037 --> 00:02:47,938
Their relationship goes beyond ordinary friends.

40
00:02:47,938 --> 00:02:50,117
Do you know who she is?

41
00:02:50,117 --> 00:02:52,141
She does look familiar.

42
00:02:52,141 --> 00:02:54,316
I think I've seen her at a brothel.

43
00:02:54,316 --> 00:03:00,268
It's great that she's from a brothel. If 13th Prince can have her, so can our 9th Prince.

44
00:03:00,268 --> 00:03:01,800
Yes, 9th Prince.

45
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,383
9th Prince can have her too. Yes.

46
00:03:04,383 --> 00:03:07,984
If 9th Prince is afraid of trouble, let's forget about it.

47
00:03:07,984 --> 00:03:10,070
What do you mean? That's right.

48
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:11,349
Ask her to come over.

49
00:03:12,096 --> 00:03:12,814
Alright.

50
00:03:14,571 --> 00:03:15,693
Come.

51
00:03:17,025 --> 00:03:19,687
Come on. Come over.

52
00:03:19,687 --> 00:03:21,398
This is our 9th Prince.

53
00:03:21,398 --> 00:03:23,666
What can I do for you, sirs?

54
00:03:23,666 --> 00:03:27,306
Our 9th Prince wants you to drink with him.

55
00:03:27,306 --> 00:03:28,260
Here.

56
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:31,336
Drink up. Have a drink. Drink.

57
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:35,701
Thank you for your drink, 9th Prince. I shall drink this now.

58
00:03:39,277 --> 00:03:43,535
Good. Well done. Great.

59
00:03:43,535 --> 00:03:45,547
- Again.
- Goodbye.

60
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:50,469
- Don't go.
- Without my permission, who can go?

61
00:03:50,469 --> 00:03:53,418
That's right.
- She wants to go?

62
00:03:57,621 --> 00:04:01,565
9th Prince, I've something important at home.

63
00:04:01,565 --> 00:04:04,669
9th Prince... please allow me to go.

64
00:04:04,669 --> 00:04:05,901
Sit down.

65
00:04:05,901 --> 00:04:07,838
Sit.

66
00:04:07,838 --> 00:04:09,545
Drink.

67
00:04:09,545 --> 00:04:11,553
I really cannot drink.

68
00:04:13,164 --> 00:04:17,358
Drink up. Finish this.

69
00:04:19,085 --> 00:04:21,278
Drink up. Come on.

70
00:04:21,278 --> 00:04:22,514
9th Broth--

71
00:04:23,836 --> 00:04:25,322
Why are you so late?

72
00:04:25,322 --> 00:04:26,575
What are you doing?

73
00:04:26,575 --> 00:04:27,500
Let go.

74
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,380
14th Prince.

75
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:31,645
Don't bother about that. Have your drink.

76
00:04:33,635 --> 00:04:36,668
Miss Luwu, follow me out.

77
00:04:41,191 --> 00:04:43,920
9th Prince, this...

78
00:04:45,667 --> 00:04:46,724
Letting her off like that?

79
00:04:46,724 --> 00:04:48,031
Continue to drink.

80
00:04:48,031 --> 00:04:51,700
Have some tea. Boss, come. Quickly.

81
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:54,758
14th Prince. Thank you for saving me.

82
00:04:54,758 --> 00:05:02,442
I'm sorry for 9th Brother's behaviour. He isn't like that normally. Maybe since he's been unhappy recently,

83
00:05:02,442 --> 00:05:05,040
that's why he's behaved improperly toward you.

84
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,500
14th Prince, don't take this to heart.

85
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:11,112
9th Prince was only offering me a drink.

86
00:05:11,112 --> 00:05:14,595
It's because I didn't accept, that's why he's angry.

87
00:05:14,595 --> 00:05:20,180
You are too kind. You were being bullied, but yet you still want to help him.

88
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:24,378
14th Prince, I didn't see that as bullying.

89
00:05:24,378 --> 00:05:28,114
But please don't tell 13th Prince about it.

90
00:05:28,114 --> 00:05:34,380
13th Prince is a loyal and impartial person, I'm afraid that he will get into trouble because of me

91
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:41,600
You know how to think of other people. It's 13th Brother's good fortune to have you as a friend.

92
00:05:46,522 --> 00:05:48,627
I think he's too good for me.

93
00:05:48,627 --> 00:05:52,500
If 13th Brother hears you,  he will not be happy.

94
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,882
That's from the bottom of my heart.

95
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:04,034
I... I've always felt that... if 13th Prince is known as my friend, there will be bad rumors about him.

96
00:06:04,034 --> 00:06:06,513
Do you think that 13th brother would mind?

97
00:06:06,513 --> 00:06:08,980
But I mind,

98
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:11,275
especially if it's my fault.

99
00:06:13,318 --> 00:06:15,601
I think 9th Prince's men will not come after me.

100
00:06:15,601 --> 00:06:19,880
I can return on my own. Thank you, 14th Prince.

101
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,885
It's fine. I should help.

102
00:06:22,885 --> 00:06:26,321
If you walk along with me, it's also not right.

103
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:29,500
Goodbye.

104
00:06:30,028 --> 00:06:32,805
Alright, but do be careful on the way.

105
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:48,759
This looks really exquisite. I'm sure it's hard to make.

106
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:50,770
I knew you would like it.

107
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:55,360
You should thank 10th brother. He got this lantern from someone by force.

108
00:06:57,274 --> 00:07:00,671
You really know how to embarrass me. You were eyeing this lantern also.

109
00:07:00,671 --> 00:07:02,780
You suggested to get this for Rouxi first.

110
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:10,720
But when I heard that the owner only wanted to display this lantern and wouldn't sell it for any price,

111
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,924
I had already given up on that idea.

112
00:07:12,924 --> 00:07:20,820
However, you told him your identity and... you insisted that he sell it to you. I was also embarrassed by you.

113
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:28,340
It's just a plaything to me, but this is another person's treasure.

114
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:30,200
Return this quickly.

115
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,300
I've already taken it, how can I return it now?

116
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:33,640
Keep it.

117
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:38,560
It's just a lantern. We already paid for it, don't be so particular about it.

118
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,540
Return it quickly.

119
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:45,440
Alright. Such a waste of my effort.

120
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,180
Why didn't you advise him not to do it?

121
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:48,852
Ask him if I advised him or not.

122
00:07:48,852 --> 00:07:51,160
I did, but he didn't listen to me either.

123
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:56,740
When he's stubborn about something, only 3 people in this world can advise him.

124
00:07:57,669 --> 00:07:59,140
I'm not one of those 3 people.

125
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:00,580
What 3 people?

126
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:02,100
8th brother.

127
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:04,460
Rouxi.

128
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:09,300
The last one is your arch enemy ever since you were young, the current 10th Fu'jin. (Fu'jin - wife)

129
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,600
13th Brother.

130
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:23,540
9th Brother. 13th Brother, stop it.

131
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:26,260
Don't go overboard, you cannot fight here.

132
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:28,060
13th, what do you want?

133
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:29,960
14th Brother, let him go. I shall see what he can do to me.

134
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,380
Stop it, 9th Brother.

135
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:32,660
Take 9th Prince away.

136
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:34,140
If His Majesty hears about this, there will be trouble.

137
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:35,780
Alright. Let's go, 9th Brother.

138
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:36,500
Quickly.

139
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,320
- 13h Prince.
- Go.

140
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,559
- 13th Prince.
-  Alright.

141
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:45,440
Go to my place first.

142
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:52,940
Why did you stop me from beating that beast?

143
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:57,740
If you fight with him and blow this matter up. It won't be  good for Miss Luwu either.

144
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:01,760
I just heard about this matter last night.

145
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,180
So when I saw him just now, I became agitated.

146
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:06,200
I just wanted to give him a few punches.

147
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,060
What happened?

148
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:16,540
14th Brother, this time, thank you for your help.

149
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:19,840
Last time, you helped me to resolve my problem with Min Min Ge'ge.

150
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,460
This time you don't have to thank me.

151
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:25,200
Furthermore, it's 9th Brother's fault.

152
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,860
What did 9th Prince do? I thought she already redeemed herself a few years ago.

153
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:31,320
She is only an entertainer and not a prostitute.

154
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:34,780
As an unmarried young girl, why ask so much?

155
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:39,120
That fellow is too bold. He tried to bully Luwu.

156
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,840
Luckily 14th brother saw it and saved her.

157
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:44,740
I knew that 9th Prince was lecherous, but I never expected this from him.

158
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:48,640
He actually bullies any pretty girl he comes across. He is a total jerk.

159
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,680
Rouxi!

160
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:56,600
I think you should get a few people to catch him. Cover his head and bash him.

161
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,000
Shut up. Rouxi.

162
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:04,420
Since Luwu is safe, the best method to resolve... this matter is to reduce the impact.

163
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:06,860
Why should you blow things up?

164
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:09,040
Do you want the whole capital to know about this?

165
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,480
That will only make things worse and rumors will fly.

166
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,700
Then how do you expect Luwu to continue her life?

167
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:16,200
14th Brother.

168
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,240
Pass on a message to him.

169
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:27,340
From now on, if he dares to do this again to Luwu or any other girl, I will kill him regardless of the danger.

170
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:28,980
I'm sure he won't do it again.

171
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,000
Stop here.

172
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,100
I need to be left alone.

173
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,180
It's alright, don't worry.

174
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:53,500
Aren't you too bold? How dare you scold a Prince!

175
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,300
How many heads do you have?

176
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:01,060
Actually, you cannot blame 9th Brother entirely.

177
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:03,580
That day, he had a few drinks.

178
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:06,320
Someone around him knew that Luwu previously came from a brothel.

179
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,200
They goaded him into it.

180
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,900
That's why he lost control.

181
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:14,060
So it's Luwu's and 13th Prince's fault?

182
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:16,340
I've learned something new today.

183
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:20,460
I think I've been a good savior for nothing.

184
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:23,380
By saving Luwu, 9th Brother was angry with me for a few days.

185
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:24,640
And now, here you are angry with me too.

186
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,340
If I knew this matter would be so tricky, I wouldn't have helped.

187
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:32,880
I was overcome with anger, I should be thanking you instead.

188
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,620
Why don't you scold me
and vent your anger?

189
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:36,900
I don't want to be bothered with you.

190
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:41,080
14th Prince.

191
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:42,540
What else can I do for you?

192
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:47,200
Knowing 9th Prince's character, he won't let this matter rest.

193
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,100
Since I'm involved, I will see it through.

194
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:56,620
I begged 8th Brother to talk to him also. I'm sure he will give us some face.

195
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:58,440
Thank you.

196
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:03,080
You have only met Luwu a few times, why are you so concerned about her?

197
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,420
Her character and abilities

198
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:05,780
are top-notch.

199
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:08,840
Although, I didn't have many interactions with her,

200
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:11,240
not to mention her link with 13th Prince,

201
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,660
even as a girl,

202
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:14,560
I cannot just standby and do nothing.

203
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,740
You still haven't changed that temperament of yours.

204
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:19,920
You don't care one bit  for your status.

205
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,780
You casually speak of yourself and a courtesan as if  you both are on equal terms.

206
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:25,300
You and 13th Brother

207
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:26,740
are really broadminded.

208
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:29,900
13th Prince is a refined & cultured person.

209
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:32,460
The way he treats Luwu is not as you all are thinking.

210
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:35,060
Because he admires her talents and feels pity for her life experiences,

211
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:36,660
that's why he has been protecting her all these years.

212
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:40,140
But from my perspective, the way Luwu looks at 13th Brother,

213
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:41,620
she doesn't seem to regard him as just a friend

214
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:44,700
That day, I was afraid that 9th Brother's henchmen would make trouble on the sly,

215
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:45,980
so I decided to escort her back personally.

216
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:48,700
When we were walking, she pleaded with me,

217
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,180
that by all means the incident should not

218
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:51,980
be made known to 13th Brother.

219
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:54,959
She didn't want to create trouble for 13th Brother.

220
00:12:56,045 --> 00:13:01,943
In the same situation, an ordinary girl would have cried her heart out. But she had no complaints at all...

221
00:13:01,943 --> 00:13:03,940
as she only worried for 13th Brother.

222
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:10,952
Knowing 13th Prince, I wonder if that is her good fortune or misfortune.

223
00:13:10,952 --> 00:13:16,641
I'm afraid she will never confess her feelings for him.

224
00:13:18,018 --> 00:13:23,116
You shouldn't think of other people only. Think about your own problems too.

225
00:13:23,116 --> 00:13:32,547
You've also reached the age of discharge. Instead of waiting for Imperial Father's order,  you could ask him for a marriage of your choice.

226
00:13:34,567 --> 00:13:36,943
Actually, 8th brother is really good to you.

227
00:13:36,943 --> 00:13:39,497
If you married him, I'm sure he won't control you.

228
00:13:39,497 --> 00:13:43,709
If you want to ride a horse or go out with 10th Brother or me.

229
00:13:43,709 --> 00:13:44,620
I'm sure he will agree to your request.

230
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:45,577
Stop it.

231
00:13:49,249 --> 00:13:50,789
I'm going back.

232
00:13:50,789 --> 00:13:51,850
Go ahead.

233
00:14:26,424 --> 00:14:29,961
Look as if Min Min has found her true love!

234
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:39,272
This place is really nice. No wonder 4th Prince likes to come here.

235
00:14:39,272 --> 00:14:43,391
I can cry out loud... and also laugh out loud here.

236
00:14:59,993 --> 00:15:01,122
Miss Rouxi.

237
00:15:02,594 --> 00:15:05,037
Respects to Crown Prince and Prince.

238
00:15:05,037 --> 00:15:06,152
Rise, no formality.

239
00:15:07,609 --> 00:15:10,303
I just received Min Min's letter. Thank you, Prince Heshu.

240
00:15:11,998 --> 00:15:14,659
Min Min wanted to let you know her latest news.

241
00:15:14,659 --> 00:15:16,831
You don't have to thank me.

242
00:15:16,831 --> 00:15:22,043
If Min Min is half as sensible as you. My father and I will not have to worry about her.

243
00:15:22,043 --> 00:15:29,861
You have to work in the palace now. But in the future, I will invite you to our grasslands... for some fun.

244
00:15:29,861 --> 00:15:32,044
That will curb your temper too.

245
00:15:32,687 --> 00:15:34,109
Prince Heshu.

246
00:15:34,109 --> 00:15:36,299
She won't have that chance.

247
00:15:36,299 --> 00:15:38,706
My Imperial Father takes her along with him all the time.

248
00:15:38,706 --> 00:15:43,600
But in a few years time, she will reach the age of discharge too.

249
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,480
I'm sure my Imperial Father will order a marriage for her.

250
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:51,077
If you want to invite her, I think it won't be for one person only.

251
00:15:52,052 --> 00:15:58,043
I need to do my duty now. If there's nothing else, please excuse me.

252
00:15:58,129 --> 00:16:00,272
Alright, you may go.

253
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:16,130
Sister, should I serve Huzhang and Yulan tea to 10th Prince?

254
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:20,433
The Imperial Physician told me that this combination could help to reduce swelling.

255
00:16:20,433 --> 00:16:22,810
Is 10th Prince injured? What happened?

256
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:24,528
You didn't know?

257
00:16:24,528 --> 00:16:30,033
10th Prince was beaten up by 10th Fu'jin. I thought you knew.

258
00:16:30,033 --> 00:16:32,850
Respects to 14th Prince.

259
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:34,118
Respect to 14th Prince.

260
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:35,793
Rise..

261
00:16:35,793 --> 00:16:36,935
Yunxiang, you go first.

262
00:16:36,935 --> 00:16:37,771
Yes.

263
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,276
14th Prince.

264
00:16:45,276 --> 00:16:48,431
I heard that 10th Prince was beaten up by 10th Fu'jin.

265
00:16:51,101 --> 00:16:52,355
This pair is a funny couple.

266
00:16:53,655 --> 00:16:55,652
I don't know who owes who a debt.

267
00:16:57,092 --> 00:16:58,622
How's 10th Prince now?

268
00:16:58,622 --> 00:17:02,234
Imperial Physician said that he's alright, don't worry.

269
00:17:02,234 --> 00:17:03,840
That's good.

270
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:04,961
Have some tea here.

271
00:17:04,961 --> 00:17:05,765
Alright.

272
00:17:07,726 --> 00:17:14,753
I've known you since young or else I'd really misunderstand you. Who acts like you? You seem to be too concerned about him.

273
00:17:14,753 --> 00:17:16,860
What goes in your mind?

274
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:18,582
Oh no.

275
00:17:19,383 --> 00:17:20,790
Sister, there's trouble.

276
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:22,212
What happened?

277
00:17:22,726 --> 00:17:26,748
Just.... Just now the Crown Prince asked His Majesty to grant a marriage.

278
00:17:26,748 --> 00:17:28,319
He wants to marry you, Sister.

279
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,405
What?

280
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:41,302
Sister, what happened to you? Don't scare me.

281
00:17:42,881 --> 00:17:44,024
Where's 14th Prince?

282
00:17:44,024 --> 00:17:49,065
After 14th Prince heard about the Crown Prince's request. He was so angry that he left.

283
00:17:49,065 --> 00:17:53,407
Before he left, he asked me to stay by your side and take care of you.

284
00:17:56,117 --> 00:18:00,389
Sister, don't be anxious. His Majesty has not decided yet.

285
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:05,967
Repeat whatever you saw today to me. Tell me every detail.

286
00:18:05,967 --> 00:18:08,196
Do not even miss one of His Majesty's small movements.

287
00:18:08,196 --> 00:18:09,257
Alright.

288
00:18:09,257 --> 00:18:21,325
I have given this matter serious thought. I already have a few wives, but I still need someone who is meticulous by my side.

289
00:18:21,325 --> 00:18:23,600
Lady Rouxi is well educated.

290
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,303
I really like her.

291
00:18:28,253 --> 00:18:35,823
Therefore, I boldly request for Imperial Father to give her to me as my wife.  I promise to treat her well.

292
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:37,843
Please agree to my request.

293
00:18:41,108 --> 00:18:45,540
Rouxi has been serving me for years. She does a good job too.

294
00:18:47,619 --> 00:18:49,739
I also know that she should get married soon.

295
00:18:53,029 --> 00:18:55,994
But I'm also getting old.

296
00:18:55,994 --> 00:19:02,281
I need someone like her,  who knows
how to serve and care for me...
to stay by my side too.

297
00:19:02,281 --> 00:19:07,597
For my own selfishness, I would like to keep her by my side for a few more years.

298
00:19:07,597 --> 00:19:10,263
After that, I will arrange a good marriage for her.

299
00:19:10,263 --> 00:19:16,329
I will also give her a big dowry and get her married in style.

300
00:19:16,329 --> 00:19:20,220
That will repay her for serving me all these years.

301
00:19:23,168 --> 00:19:25,497
Today, your request came suddenly.

302
00:19:27,766 --> 00:19:29,623
I need to consider this.

303
00:19:30,708 --> 00:19:39,031
At that point, I'd already served the tea and needed to leave. I don't know what else His Majesty said to the Crown Prince.

304
00:19:39,031 --> 00:19:43,307
I can understand what's on Crown Prince's mind.

305
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:47,340
There are 3 reasons why he wants to marry me.

306
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:49,500
One, because of His Majesty.

307
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,038
Two, because of the Mongolians.

308
00:19:51,038 --> 00:19:53,063
Three, because of my father.

309
00:19:53,063 --> 00:19:56,921
Ultimately, he only wants to strengthen his own position.

310
00:19:56,921 --> 00:19:59,436
Sister, don't lose heart.

311
00:19:59,436 --> 00:20:03,423
Since His Majesty said that he needed to consider. He may not marry you off to the Crown Prince.

312
00:20:03,423 --> 00:20:08,580
But I don't know what's on His Majesty's mind.

313
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:13,205
If His Majesty agrees to it, what should I do?

314
00:20:13,205 --> 00:20:15,460
Must I really marry the Crown Prince?

315
00:20:16,526 --> 00:20:19,977
Or... can I reject the edict?

316
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:24,340
Or maybe...

317
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:26,455
I should prepare a white sash.  (to hang herself)

318
00:20:26,455 --> 00:20:27,400
Sister!

319
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,440
Don't have funny ideas!

320
00:20:36,606 --> 00:20:41,540
I know everybody else's ending. But I don't know my own ending.

321
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:45,300
Don't tell me that Heaven has prepared this ending for me?

322
00:20:52,581 --> 00:20:55,625
8th Brother, you need to help Rouxi.

323
00:20:55,625 --> 00:20:56,860
What happened to her?

324
00:20:56,860 --> 00:21:00,820
The Crown Prince wants Imperial Father to marry Rouxi to him.

325
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:02,260
When did this happen?

326
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:04,220
Yutan just informed me and Rouxi.

327
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:06,061
It has just happened.

328
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:11,320
Rouxi... what happened to her?

329
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,860
After she heard about it, she fainted.

330
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:24,580
All these years,  Rouxi has encountered several major events.

331
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:26,940
I'm sure she can hang on.

332
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:31,380
Since the Crown Prince requested her,  I think Imperial Father will not reject him.

333
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:41,100
14th Brother, bring me the records and account book of the Fujian case.

334
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,900
Imperial Father has already closed that case.

335
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:44,700
Why do you need them?

336
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:48,205
I think we should think of a way to save Rouxi now.

337
00:21:48,205 --> 00:21:50,040
I'm trying to save her now.

338
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:54,160
One knock can create a vibration but no one bothers to add another final knock.

339
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,660
8th Brother means that...

340
00:21:56,660 --> 00:22:02,534
I want to add another final knock to this case and send a strong rippling wave in the Court.

341
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:06,360
This way, we can save Rouxi.

342
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:24,600
Many years ago, I felt sad when I saw 10th Prince being ordered to marry.

343
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:33,700
Now, I finally realize that it wasn't only sadness I felt but hopelessness too.

344
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:37,340
When I recall the face of Crown Prince

345
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:40,280
and that lustful look when he saw Min Min Ge'ge,

346
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:42,874
I felt so disgusted by him.

347
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:48,280
Was I wrong?

348
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:53,100
Did I land myself into deep trouble?

349
00:22:56,444 --> 00:23:01,140
4th, 14th, and 8th Prince.

350
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:02,940
All of them reminded me before.

351
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:12,060
But I always thought that I'm lucky and there are only a few more years to go.

352
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:18,500
I didn't realize that someone would hanker after me.

353
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:25,820
Now, it's too late to regret.

354
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:28,300
Sister, stop thinking about it.

355
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:32,180
Why are you so hot?

356
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:36,400
Sister, you are running a fever. I will ask Eunuch Li to get the Imperial Physician.

357
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:58,240
Water.

358
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:03,920
I'm thirsty... water.

359
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:24,600
Since Imperial Father has not sent an edict. It means that you still have a chance.

360
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:34,840
Don't think of anything now,  listen to the Imperial Physician, and rest well.

361
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:40,160
I lured Yutan away, but she's coming back soon.
I cannot stay for long.

362
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:46,180
♫ Stopping here, afraid to go any further,  ♫

363
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:51,020
♫ so sorrow will be unable to make an appearance  ♫

364
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:56,760
♫  On the next page, the farewell penned by you,  ♫

365
00:24:56,760 --> 00:25:01,600
You... I told you of it a few years back, but you didn't heed my advice.

366
00:25:02,714 --> 00:25:06,220
Now it has finally happened, so what's the point of holding on to me now?

367
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:12,100
♫  We’ve walked down this path too hastily  ♫

368
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:18,620
♫  Embracing desires that weren’t realistic  ♫

369
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:24,940
♫  Not in time, wasn’t able to wait long enough to look back and admire  ♫

370
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:30,300
♫  The fragrance of magnolia is unable to hide wounds  ♫

371
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:35,540
Now, I cannot give you any promises.

372
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:43,300
Because I don't know if I can do anything. You must understand that the person in question, is the Crown Prince.

373
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:46,900
But don't worry.

374
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:50,560
I will not forsake you, not caring.

375
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:56,260
♫  No longer sighing, you once said that life is unpredictable  ♫

376
00:25:56,260 --> 00:26:03,340
♫  The three inches of sunlight that I was unable to borrow  ♫

377
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:12,580
♫  No longer looking for the sunlight peeking through the clouds  ♫

378
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:18,940
♫  No longer looking for the paradise that we promised each other  ♫

379
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:25,580
♫  No longer sighing, you once said that life is unpredictable  ♫

380
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:32,020
♫  The three inches of sunlight that I was unable to borrow  ♫

381
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:40,820
♫  That paradise is the place where I’d loved you  ♫

382
00:26:51,685 --> 00:26:53,680
Sister, have some food.

383
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:56,160
You didn't have a bite yesterday, you must be hungry.

384
00:26:56,160 --> 00:27:00,739
The Imperial Physician said that your fever is gone. You look so much better now.

385
00:27:00,739 --> 00:27:03,360
If His Majesty really wants to grant this marriage...

386
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,860
What can I do

387
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:09,959
to stop His Majesty from marrying me to the Crown Prince?

388
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:15,878
Sister, you are thinking too much. Come and have some food.

389
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:24,920
If I can hang on until next year,

390
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:28,680
I think His Majesty will not give me to the Crown Prince.

391
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,720
Why not?

392
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:35,080
Because in the coming year, the Crown Prince will...

393
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:39,580
What will His Highness do?

394
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:42,580
You look better than yesterday.

395
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,340
Rouxi.

396
00:27:48,426 --> 00:27:49,860
Respects to 14th Prince.

397
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:51,200
Rise.

398
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,460
You are sick, don't be so polite.

399
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:02,800
14th Prince, if there's nothing else. I shall go now.

400
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:14,580
Do you know why the Crown Prince  wants to marry you?

401
00:28:16,259 --> 00:28:17,660
Su'er Gua'er Jia Wang ye...

402
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:21,700
asked Imperial Father to grant Min Min Ge'ge and Prince Zouyin's marriage.

403
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:24,340
The request just reached the court today.

404
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:27,500
He had already gotten the news beforehand.

405
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:30,780
I will explain the details to you on another day.

406
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:32,240
Let me ask you.

407
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,720
Do you want to marry the Crown Prince?

408
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,840
8th Prince cannot come and visit you.

409
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:40,340
But he wanted me to tell you that...

410
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:43,520
you must try to delay and gain more time.

411
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:46,220
In 10 days, you will see your chance.

412
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:50,120
Thank you.

413
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:51,580
Don't.

414
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:54,900
I advised you to choose your own husband, but you didn't.

415
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:58,200
Now, its too late to regret.

416
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:02,520
It's much better for you to marry 8th Prince instead, right?

417
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:07,100
Take care and don't worry. I have to go now.

418
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:11,220
For the next few days, I cannot come. Take good care of yourself.

419
00:29:13,373 --> 00:29:14,360
14th Prince.

420
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:20,220
Thank you.

421
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:34,225
4th Brother, I followed your instructions and listed those people... who are connected to the Crown Prince.

422
00:29:34,225 --> 00:29:39,540
But I still don't understand why the Crown Prince wants to marry Rouxi.

423
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:45,600
The Crown Prince's biggest supporter, Sou'er Tu  died of starvation in jail.

424
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,620
That's why his position is shaken.

425
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:52,380
Moreover, Imperial Father approved Min Min Ge'ge and Prince Zouyin's marriage.

426
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:58,500
If the Crown Prince can marry Rouxi, he will be connected to the Mongolians by marriage.

427
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:02,860
With their backing, his position will be more stable.

428
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:07,000
The Crown Prince is really calculating.

429
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:13,120
But poor Rouxi will be the sacrifice.

430
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:17,900
This matter will give her a good lesson.

431
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:23,320
This will teach her about being flexible before anything major happens.

432
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:29,480
She must learn that not everything can be resolved by being cheeky.

433
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:33,180
I can relax after hearing you now.

434
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:38,320
Don't assume that I'm 100% confident.

435
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:41,580
But you look confident.

436
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:45,300
What else can I do?

437
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:48,300
In the end, we have to leave it to her fate.

438
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,200
Give this list of names to 14th Brother.

439
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,600
That's akin to giving it to 8th Brother.

440
00:30:55,600 --> 00:31:01,960
4th brother, are you sure you want to work with 8th Brother to topple the Crown Prince?

441
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:08,240
At least we can make the Crown Prince so busy that he will not think about the marriage request.

442
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:11,200
That's killing 2 birds with 1 stone.

443
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:16,973
But this matter should be kept a secret,

444
00:31:16,973 --> 00:31:19,580
if not, we will not be able to save Rouxi...

445
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:23,500
and we will also get ourselves into trouble.

446
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:37,940
I think I don't have to say 4th Brother's intention.

447
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:46,800
But what about the Crown Prince's relationship with all of you?

448
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:54,480
Everyone knows the character of the Crown Prince. We're doing this for Rouxi.

449
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:59,420
I don't know if Rouxi is fortunate or not.

450
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:03,620
She got into this problem but so many people are helping her.

451
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:07,500
That's all we can do.

452
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:10,740
The rest will have to depend on you guys.

453
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:16,000
Since 4th and 8th Brother are joining forces, I'm sure Rouxi will be saved.

454
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:21,540
It has been a long time since I've served you.

455
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:25,860
Bei'le-ye?

456
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:30,080
Do you have some problem on your mind?

457
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:34,960
Everything in court is problematic.

458
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,760
I know.

459
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:43,280
I'm just worried about your health. I, also don't know how to share your burden.

460
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:50,500
I cannot wait for Hong Wang to grow up quickly and share your worries.

461
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:58,900
I don't want him to be like me. When other children were playing,

462
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:02,860
I'd already learnt to observe other people's intent.

463
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,020
Ming Hui.

464
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:11,640
I really need your help to do something.

465
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:15,080
I want you to ask Zhenguo Gong and Jingxi Wangye.

466
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:19,920
to report on what bad dealings the Crown Prince has allowed his men to do.

467
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,300
Are you 100% confident?

468
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:29,954
Only the Heavens have 100% confidence.

469
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:32,460
What are the odds of winning, then?

470
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:45,820
I know that you don't like me to ask about court affairs and I didn't ask because you asked my uncle to help.

471
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:50,380
This is a really dangerous thing to do, so I'm worried.

472
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:53,980
I will ask someone else to help then.

473
00:33:56,820 --> 00:34:00,100
This matter concerns Rouxi, right?

474
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:09,960
I heard that the Crown Prince has asked His Majesty to bestow Rouxi on him.

475
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:13,940
At this moment, you also wanted to attack him.

476
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:18,680
It's hard for me to ignore the link between these two matters.

477
00:34:19,604 --> 00:34:23,240
Rouxi is one of the reasons.

478
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:26,980
I know that you knew what was on my mind.

479
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:31,700
I did have the intention to take her as my wife.

480
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:35,539
But she has already rejected my request.

481
00:34:35,539 --> 00:34:37,379
Why are you risking your life to help her?

482
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:46,320
It's alright if you don't want to help me. Just forget what I asked.

483
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:49,980
I will talk to my uncle.

484
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:57,700
As long as you can stop worrying about it. I will do my best to help you despite the difficulty.

485
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:08,620
It pains me to see you like this.

486
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:13,560
Maybe, this is what a married couple is all about.

487
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:17,580
We shall suffer together.

488
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:24,940
I never regretted my decision to marry you.

489
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:40,740
Ming Hui. I've said this before. No one can ever replace your position.

490
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,720
Sister! Sister, what are you doing? Have you gone mad?

491
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,020
Yutan.

492
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:55,440
I can't drink this medicine.

493
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,640
Why?

494
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:03,220
Yutan, all these years I've treated you like my real sister.

495
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:06,340
I really don't want to marry the Crown Prince.

496
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:08,580
But now, I have no other way.

497
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:11,020
I can only use my sickness to delay them.

498
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:12,860
However, I cannot pretend to be sick.

499
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:16,960
If Eunuch Li asks the Imperial Physician, they will know.

500
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:21,100
So, you must continue to give me this medicine but then throw it away behind their backs.

501
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:49,900
Sister, you are too weak now. You can't afford to do this any longer.

502
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:52,340
To save myself, I must stay sick.

503
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:53,820
Yutan.

504
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:57,340
Don't stop me if I'm your friend.

505
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:58,900
Slowly.

506
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:04,380
Yutan.

507
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:13,180
Don't get the Imperial Physician yet. Let my hair dry more and let my forehead feel hotter before you get help.

508
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:24,320
Li De Quan.

509
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,620
Yes, Your Majesty.

510
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:26,800
What has happened to Rouxi?

511
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,860
She seems to have been sick for a long time, has she recovered?

512
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:30,560
Did the Imperial Physician check on her?

513
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:31,920
Replying to your Majesty.

514
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:38,540
I asked the Imperial Physician to see her and asked Yutan to take care of her.

515
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:43,540
But her illness is serious and her fever refuses to decrease.

516
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:51,100
Ask the Imperial Physician to pay more attention and use whatever medicine they need.

517
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:51,840
Yes.

518
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,420
Your Majesty.

519
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:01,460
Zhengguo Gong has an urgent petition for Your Majesty.

520
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:02,320
Bring it here.

521
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:13,160
Where's Zhenggou Gong?

522
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:15,940
Your Majesty, he's waiting outside the court.

523
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:19,760
Summon all the Princes to court.

524
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:20,620
Yes.

525
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:29,680
Zhengguo Gong reported to me that he suspects the Crown Prince of forming his own political group.

526
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:32,700
This involves about 10 to 20 people.

527
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:34,920
Army Commander, Tou He'qi.

528
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:37,060
Commander-in-command, E'shan.

529
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:38,660
Law Secretary, Qi Shi Wu.

530
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:41,620
Army Secretary, Geng'e.

531
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:45,140
Many 8 main division First commanders,

532
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:47,560
Second-in-commanders and other important people in the military.

533
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:52,420
Imperial Father, there's no such thing. I'm being framed.

534
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:53,760
Zhengguo Gong.

535
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:58,060
Did I say something in error?

536
00:39:58,060 --> 00:40:03,500
Your Majesty, what you said is what I reported.

537
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:06,420
On the list of names, there are important people who hold power in the army.

538
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:12,420
If they band together, it will pose a threat to Your Majesty.

539
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:17,380
That's why I must report this to your Majesty even if it will cost me my life.

540
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:22,060
Imperial Father, don't believe him. It's a pack of lies.

541
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:24,100
Crown Prince.

542
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:27,460
Did you join them at their feast?

543
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:29,920
Imperial Father...  I didn't.

544
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:33,525
Crown Prince, you will be committing a huge crime if you lie.

545
00:40:33,525 --> 00:40:41,480
Recall again before you reply to His Majesty.

546
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:47,160
Imperial Father, the Crown Prince needs to entertain those people sometimes.

547
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:49,780
It's normal to have various people at such a feast.

548
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:53,720
You cannot conclude that the Crown Prince is forming his own political group.

549
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:55,220
Yes.

550
00:40:55,220 --> 00:41:00,280
Imperial Father, I know that you hate people who try to form groups.

551
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:02,860
Why then would I do that?

552
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:05,340
Please investigate it clearly.

553
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:08,980
If this happened once in a blue moon, we would not conclude this as your crime.

554
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:14,780
But if you always see the same group of people, that's a very different story.

555
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:16,480
Imperial Father--

556
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:17,740
Alright. Alright.

557
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:24,360
Whether it is true or not cannot be determined right now.

558
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:25,640
3rd Prince.

559
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:27,500
Yes.

560
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:29,720
You shall investigate the truth.

561
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:35,780
If this is a false accusation, I will punish those who created this rumor.

562
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:42,700
If this is true,

563
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:47,940
let the Law Bureau handle it.

564
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:49,080
Yes.

565
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:12,140
Jie'jie

566
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:24,260
This morning Zhengguo Gong requested His Majesty to re-investigate a corruption case... involving Tou He'qi and other Ministers.

567
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:29,420
Zhengguo Gong and 8th Prince belong to the true blue division.

568
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:31,780
He should be his supporter.

569
00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:35,700
Tou He'qi works for the Crown Prince.

570
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,720
They are targeting the Crown Prince.

571
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:42,000
Unless,

572
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,140
this is the so called change?

573
00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:47,820
Find out what His Majesty said.

574
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:50,340
His Majesty was really serious, he ordered an investigation

575
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:55,100
Jie'jie, why are you smiling?

576
00:42:58,020 --> 00:43:00,220
The knife that was hanging over my head

577
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:02,660
has finally been removed.

578
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:05,480
Jie'jie, what do you mean?

579
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:08,160
Since His Majesty ordered an investigation of the Crown Prince's allies,

580
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:11,760
it shows that he is suspicious of the Crown Prince.

581
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:16,060
Therefore, there is no reason for him to give me to the Crown Prince.

582
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:18,300
Jie'jie, I still don't understand.

583
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:21,220
If what they said is true,

584
00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:25,240
I am linked with two of Mongolia's great tribes.

585
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:27,160
Why waste such a good advantage

586
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:28,900
on the Crown Prince.

587
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:32,440
Jie'jie's reasons are good.

588
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:34,660
Jie'jie, this is fate.

589
00:43:35,660 --> 00:43:37,100
I'll bring Jie'jie some good food.

590
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:38,260
Thank you.

591
00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:42,780
I thought I would have to wait until next year.

592
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:45,260
I never thought that now

593
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:47,460
bad news would be turned into good news.

594
00:43:48,820 --> 00:43:52,340
Looks like this time 4th Prince and 8th Prince worked together to attack the Crown Prince.

595
00:43:52,340 --> 00:43:54,480
I am only a catalyst.

596
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:42,720
Imperial Father.

597
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:44,680
This time Crown Prince's colluding with military officials

598
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:46,360
is an important matter.

599
00:44:58,220 --> 00:45:00,320
Imperial Father, the Crown Prince's actions

600
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:02,720
showcase his desire to rebel.

601
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:05,420
I am afraid that he is working together with SuoEtu's henchmen

602
00:45:05,420 --> 00:45:08,080
to destablize the government and the Emperor's position

603
00:45:32,540 --> 00:45:34,060
Magnolia.

604
00:45:34,060 --> 00:45:36,760
Why does 4th prince like magnolias?

605
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:13,200
Come back.

606
00:46:17,580 --> 00:46:19,400
Greetings, Fourth Prince.

607
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:20,860
Rise.

608
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:27,280
This hairpin looks good on you.

609
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:28,480
Why did you take it out?

610
00:46:29,580 --> 00:46:32,300
No reason, I thought 4th Prince would laugh at me.

611
00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:34,180
Reason?

612
00:46:34,180 --> 00:46:35,960
This magnolia hairpin,

613
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:38,680
I have kept until now.

614
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:40,540
I unknowingly put it on today.

615
00:46:42,460 --> 00:46:44,480
Afterward...

616
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:46,100
Afterward what?

617
00:46:47,380 --> 00:46:48,940
Afterward...

618
00:46:50,620 --> 00:46:53,800
is the 4th Prince willing to marry me?

619
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:03,120
♫ Stopping here, afraid to go any further,  ♫

620
00:47:04,420 --> 00:47:09,110
♫ so sorrow will be unable to make an appearance  ♫

621
00:47:10,910 --> 00:47:16,610
♫  On the next page, the farewell penned by you,  ♫

622
00:47:17,170 --> 00:47:22,040
♫  it was not up to me to refuse  ♫

623
00:47:23,580 --> 00:47:29,030
♫  We’ve walked down this path too hastily  ♫

624
00:47:30,340 --> 00:47:36,060
♫  Embracing desires that weren’t realistic  ♫

625
00:47:36,850 --> 00:47:42,390
♫  Not in time, wasn’t able to wait long enough to look back and admire  ♫

626
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:48,230
♫  The fragrance of magnolia is unable to hide wounds  ♫

627
00:47:48,690 --> 00:47:54,500
♫  No longer looking for the sun’s rays peeking through the clouds  ♫

628
00:47:55,100 --> 00:48:00,950
♫  No longer looking for the paradise that we promised each other  ♫

629
00:48:01,550 --> 00:48:07,610
♫  No longer sighing, you once said that life is unpredictable  ♫

630
00:48:08,050 --> 00:48:15,760
♫  The three inches of sunlight that I was unable to borrow  ♫

631
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:23,920
♫  No longer looking for the sunlight peeking through the clouds  ♫

632
00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:30,350
♫  No longer looking for the paradise that we promised each other  ♫

633
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:36,730
♫  No longer sighing, you once said that life is unpredictable  ♫

634
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:42,960
♫  The three inches of sunlight that I was unable to borrow  ♫

635
00:48:43,770 --> 00:48:52,040
♫  That paradise is the place where I’d loved you  ♫
