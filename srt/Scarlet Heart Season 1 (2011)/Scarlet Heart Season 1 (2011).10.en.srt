00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:20,700
♫  In the blink of an eye, a thought of stubborn persistence  ♫

3
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:24,500
♫  We were destined to seek our doom like moths flying towards the flame  ♫

4
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:30,400
♫  Knowing that it’d be a disaster, why am I still at a loss about what to do  ♫

5
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:39,200
♫  The best is not to see, the best is not to miss you  ♫

6
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:44,400
♫  Only like this can I not be in love with you  ♫

7
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:48,900
♫  Just another brushing of the shoulder, and from then...♫

8
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:53,200
♫  I’ll keep falling deeper and deeper in love with you  ♫

9
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,200
♫  It’s the mistake of time,

10
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:02,400
♫  forcing us to pass each other by  ♫

11
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:05,500
♫  How I miss you, how far you are  ♫

12
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:12,300
♫  Even though I’d known it’d only result in pain, at this moment, I still don’t want to escape  ♫

13
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:16,840
♫  Pity these words are too glaring they hurt the eyes  ♫

14
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:17,600
♫  Two worlds later ♫

15
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:22,570
♫  Two worlds later ♫

16
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:23,600
♫  Don’t want to escape  ♫

17
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,200
♫  Don’t want to escape  ♫

18
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,800
♫  It’s the mistake of time,  ♫

19
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:30,300
♫  we can only pass each other by  ♫

20
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:35,200
♫  The magnitude of me missing you is as much as how far you are   ♫

21
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:41,900
♫  Even though I know the ending is a mistake that I cannot oppose  ♫

22
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:47,100
♫  Staying in this moment  ♫

23
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:54,500
♫  We can only accept that the feelings run deep, but fate is shallow  ♫

24
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:02,000
Scarlet Heart
Episode 10

25
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:18,000
Even if I commit an enormous mistake,

26
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,080
I still wish to speak my mind.

27
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:26,880
Speak.

28
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,400
While serving your Majesty,

29
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,640
I've seen how much you love your sons.

30
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:36,480
Especially when Eighteenth Prince passed away.

31
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,400
You were heartbroken,

32
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,160
even to the point of falling ill.

33
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:44,400
I see clearly your love for your sons.

34
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:51,060
But Your Majesty,

35
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:52,720
why can't you be more lenient to your sons who are still by your side,

36
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,600
being filial to you?

37
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,540
Father and sons.

38
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:59,360
- Emperor and his courtiers.
- Enough.

39
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:07,380
Your Majesty is a benevolent father. I'm sure you want to have your family by your side

40
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:09,620
and enjoy familial love too.

41
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:13,220
As they often say, if the father is benevolent, the sons will be filial.

42
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:19,100
Dismissed.

43
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,380
Your Majesty,

44
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:32,800
Ruoxi has offended you.

45
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,960
She really is becoming more and more audacious.

46
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,760
Your Majesty,

47
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:45,360
It's true that Ruoxi was impulsive,

48
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,720
but she remains calm, be it in favour or disgrace.

49
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,120
She was just speaking out of concern for Your Majesty's relationships with your sons.

50
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,680
Your Majesty.

51
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,980
Greetings to Concubine De.

52
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:17,640
Enough, you're excused from formalities.

53
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,760
Enough, enough. Hurry and lie down.

54
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,900
Can't you take more care of your health?

55
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,320
How is it? Does it still hurt?

56
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,760
Mother, be at ease.

57
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,360
The physician has already applied medication.

58
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,820
Look at you! Infuriating your Imperial Father,

59
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:33,180
you've offended His Majesty now, haven't you?

60
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:34,800
Your son is aware of his rashness.

61
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,520
However, in order to save Eighth Brother,

62
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:39,720
I couldn't just stay put and not put in a word of fairness.

63
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:42,560
A person's flesh and body originate from their parents.

64
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,200
I have to reprimand you.

65
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:48,300
In order to plead for leniency on behalf of your Eighth Brother, you had no regard for your own safety.

66
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:51,980
In the future, you should think again prior to doing anything.

67
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:53,780
You can't be rash.

68
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:55,260
I understand.

69
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:57,220
In the future, I won't be rash again.

70
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:59,400
Fourth Prince has arrived!

71
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,240
I give my greetings to Mother.

72
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,320
Greetings to Fourth Prince.

73
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,160
Excused.

74
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:08,240
Fourteenth Brother.

75
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,160
I've brought the best wound healing medicine.

76
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,720
- You should try using it first.
- No need.

77
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,500
The physical injury on me

78
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,440
is much less than the hurt I feel in my heart.

79
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,200
We're blood brothers, and you were willing to sit by and watch me die.

80
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:23,400
Instead, it was Fifth Brother who went all out to stop Imperial Father from killing me.

81
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,880
Since Fourth Brother steers clear of matters to protect yourself,

82
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,840
don't pretend to be kind.

83
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:33,340
I've also heard about this.

84
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:35,360
Fourth Prince,

85
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,560
how do you explain this?

86
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:42,020
If I pled for leniency to Imperial Father,

87
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:44,260
I fear that it would have only made matters worse,

88
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:46,520
and made Imperial Father even more unhappy.

89
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:49,480
Fourteenth Brother and I are both your biological sons.

90
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:52,800
I'm afraid that others might think that I'm biased towards him.

91
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,120
In order to prevent others from gossiping,

92
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,400
you disregarded your brother's life?

93
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:02,520
Fourth Prince,

94
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:05,260
you've always been cautious.

95
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:07,840
However, today I need to say a word of fairness.

96
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,600
You two brothers

97
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,620
are my flesh.

98
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:15,280
In the future, no matter what happens in the palace,

99
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,060
the two of you

100
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:19,120
must help each other out.

101
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:32,360
Fourth Brother, I brought fine wine.

102
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,800
Would you care to have a cup?

103
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:42,800
Fourth Brother, actually,

104
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,640
it's only natural for Fourteenth Brother to be angry.

105
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,020
You don't need to worry about it.

106
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:48,200
How about having a drink and talking out your feelings?

107
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,360
I understand it's only human nature that Mother and Fourteenth Brother

108
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,440
are angry with me.

109
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,820
What else can I say?

110
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:57,320
Fourth Brother, you are cool-headed,

111
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,560
not cold-blooded.

112
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,640
I believe

113
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:02,420
that you could not possibly have watched Imperial Father kill Fourteenth Brother.

114
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:04,120
You definitely have a reason

115
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,640
for not speaking out on his behalf.

116
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:09,040
It is impossible that Father would have killed him.

117
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:12,720
Even a vicious tiger will not eat its cubs.

118
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,600
What's more, Imperial Father is a father who cares so much about family ties.

119
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,360
Even if he was agitated,

120
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,600
he could not bear to.

121
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,040
You're right.

122
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,200
If even Fourth Brother had spoken up as well,

123
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,040
then it would have alienated Imperial Father,

124
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,760
and would have made things worse instead.

125
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:29,720
If it had come to that, the situation might have gotten out of control.

126
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,760
No one knows me better than you.

127
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:37,400
Then, how about a drink with me?

128
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,000
One sentence by you

129
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,560
is already better than a thousand cups of wine.

130
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,000
You know as well,

131
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,960
I don't like to drown my sorrows in wine.

132
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:45,780
You should just keep this wine

133
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:47,340
for your own enjoyment.

134
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:49,260
Fourth Brother, it's because you're too cool-headed

135
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:51,360
that you constantly get misunderstood as being cold-hearted.

136
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,360
To have gained a kindred spirit in one's life...

137
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,400
my life is without regret.

138
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,800
Since you have no regrets,

139
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,840
there's no need to feel moody about those

140
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,120
who don't understand you.

141
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:01,720
Let's go.

142
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,000
Ruolan,

143
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,880
Greetings to Bei'le.

144
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:13,280
Excused. Let's sit and talk.

145
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,560
Yes.

146
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:24,180
Ruolan, you never ask about news from outside these walls.

147
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:26,760
There are some things you may not know yet.

148
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,960
I've been stripped of my titles by Imperial Father.

149
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,680
Everyone recommended that I become the Crown Prince.

150
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:38,799
But there is no hope now either.

151
00:08:45,059 --> 00:08:46,359
Ruolan,

152
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:51,180
my heart is suffering.

153
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:53,460
Please say something to me.

154
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,600
What would Bei'le Ye like me to say?

155
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:02,000
Then I won't interrupt you reciting sutras.

156
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:22,920
Fourth Brother,

157
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:25,100
why do I see you here?

158
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,780
I was wandering around.

159
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:29,200
I didn't think to run into Eighth Brother here either.

160
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,660
Although the palace is large,

161
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:31,840
it's still contained within four walls.

162
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,400
If one wants to find a truly quiet place,

163
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,800
there aren't many options.

164
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:37,600
You're right.

165
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,440
Greetings to Fourth Prince. Greetings to Eighth Prince.

166
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,440
Go about your duties.

167
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:52,300
Jiejie, I'm going to do my shift.

168
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:58,920
Greetings, Fourth Prince. Greetings, Eighth Prince.

169
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:00,680
Rise.

170
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,040
Eighth Brother,

171
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,480
a random encounter is better than an arranged one.

172
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,640
Why not let Ruoxi make us a cup of tea?

173
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,900
Fourth Brother's suggestion is not bad.

174
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:13,680
Ruoxi, we'll have to trouble you then.

175
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,967
Yes.

176
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,160
This isn't Qianqing Palace.

177
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,629
Ruoxi, you should sit as well.

178
00:10:22,629 --> 00:10:24,240
Your servant dares not.

179
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,200
We're only two brothers casually having tea and making conversation.

180
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,800
Besides, this is your place.

181
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,200
You're the lady of the house, and we're your guests.

182
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,320
You should sit.

183
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:16,120
How rare it is, during times of bitter hardships,

184
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:18,400
to still have some sweetness.

185
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,870
Eighth Brother,

186
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:21,760
it was only in a fit of temper that Imperial Father

187
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,628
stripped you of your title.

188
00:11:24,325 --> 00:11:26,000
I think, give it some time.

189
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,280
He will certainly realize Eighth Brother's talents and capabilities.

190
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:32,101
Imperial Father,

191
00:11:32,101 --> 00:11:34,360
he still dotes on Second Brother a lot.

192
00:11:36,261 --> 00:11:38,260
It is I who wasn't able to discern the severity of this,

193
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:39,980
and even got the ministers

194
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:42,320
and princes to be blamed for nothing.

195
00:11:55,727 --> 00:11:57,000
Oh yes.

196
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Are Fourteenth Brother's injuries serious?

197
00:12:00,201 --> 00:12:01,860
It was only 20 strokes of the paddle.

198
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:03,627
He won't collapse.

199
00:12:03,627 --> 00:12:05,652
But...

200
00:12:05,652 --> 00:12:08,396
what pains him aren't these 20 strokes of the paddle.

201
00:12:08,396 --> 00:12:11,275
Fourteenth Brother is angry at Fourth Brother for not speaking on his behalf to help?

202
00:12:14,489 --> 00:12:18,493
Concubine De dotes on Fourteenth Brother.

203
00:12:18,493 --> 00:12:21,440
It seems that Fourth Brother is suffering from grievances too.

204
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:33,857
Even my own biological mother and brother won't forgive me.

205
00:12:33,857 --> 00:12:37,615
What else is there for me to say?

206
00:12:37,615 --> 00:12:39,695
Fourth Brother still has Thirteenth Brother by his side.

207
00:12:39,695 --> 00:12:42,184
He will understand you.

208
00:12:44,174 --> 00:12:46,468
It can be counted as some warmth

209
00:12:46,468 --> 00:12:48,940
that can ease my feelings.

210
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,720
Hopefully Fourth Brother's words come true.

211
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,520
Give it some time.

212
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:01,675
It's rare to meet friends when you're only eating coarse fare. Today was a rare day indeed.

213
00:13:01,675 --> 00:13:03,625
Since it's so hard to come by...

214
00:13:03,625 --> 00:13:05,558
Ruoxi,

215
00:13:05,558 --> 00:13:07,644
you should drink a cup with us too.

216
00:13:07,644 --> 00:13:09,256
Yes.

217
00:13:25,468 --> 00:13:27,258
Let's have another cup.

218
00:13:28,215 --> 00:13:29,994
Here.

219
00:13:31,545 --> 00:13:33,381
Ruoxi Jiejie, Yutan.

220
00:13:33,381 --> 00:13:34,960
Good news.

221
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,214
At court today, the Emperor

222
00:13:36,214 --> 00:13:38,443
restored the Second Prince as the Crown Prince.

223
00:13:38,443 --> 00:13:41,440
The entire court gave their congratulations. His Majesty was very pleased.

224
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,366
This is indeed happy news.

225
00:13:43,366 --> 00:13:45,780
Also, the Emperor was in a very good mood today,

226
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:48,774
he even titled Third Prince, Fourth Prince, and Fifth Prince as Qin'wang (princes of the first rank).

227
00:13:48,774 --> 00:13:53,925
Seventh Prince, Ninth Prince, Tenth Prince, Twelveth Prince, Thirteenth Prince, and Fourteenth Prince were given the title of Bei'zi (princes of the fourth rank).

228
00:13:53,925 --> 00:13:56,746
He also restored Eighth Prince's Bei'le (prince of the third rank) title.

229
00:13:56,746 --> 00:13:58,886
This is great! The storm is finally over and the skies are clearing.

230
00:13:58,886 --> 00:14:00,564
Sister, you don't have to worry anymore.

231
00:14:00,564 --> 00:14:03,358
Sister, all the bad things have already passed.

232
00:14:03,358 --> 00:14:06,019
You can put down the stone weighing down your heart.

233
00:14:06,019 --> 00:14:08,327
I really must thank you guys for this period.

234
00:14:08,327 --> 00:14:10,045
Jiejie, no need to be so polite.

235
00:14:10,045 --> 00:14:13,540
We're all standing on your side, and biased towards you.

236
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:16,318
Then we'll go back to our chores now.

237
00:14:16,318 --> 00:14:18,201
I'll take my leave now.

238
00:14:21,214 --> 00:14:24,093
It's not just Wang Xi who's biased.

239
00:14:24,093 --> 00:14:26,183
His Majesty would rather choose the Crown Prince,

240
00:14:26,183 --> 00:14:28,830
this force that he's personally fostered and is able to control,

241
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:32,035
rather than allow Eighth Prince's influence in court grow.

242
00:14:40,255 --> 00:14:41,369
Ruoxi!

243
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,388
Greetings to Tenth Prince. Greetings to Fourteenth Prince.

244
00:14:44,388 --> 00:14:45,870
Rise.

245
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:47,585
Yutan said you went to pick lilacs.

246
00:14:47,585 --> 00:14:50,586
We thought it over, and figured that only over here, would there be lilacs.

247
00:14:50,586 --> 00:14:52,768
Indeed, we've found you here.

248
00:14:52,768 --> 00:14:55,769
Well? Aren't I clever?

249
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:57,562
You guys specially came to look for me. Is something the matter?

250
00:14:57,562 --> 00:14:58,738
Do you hear that?

251
00:14:58,738 --> 00:15:00,131
She herself has forgotten!

252
00:15:00,131 --> 00:15:03,521
You remember everyone else's birthday,

253
00:15:03,521 --> 00:15:06,168
but you've forgotten your own!

254
00:15:06,168 --> 00:15:09,126
Which girl would want to remember her own birthday,

255
00:15:09,126 --> 00:15:10,705
and remind herself that she's another year older?

256
00:15:10,705 --> 00:15:13,831
Look at her. It's become our fault now.

257
00:15:13,831 --> 00:15:16,006
Let's forget about whether or not you're old first.

258
00:15:16,006 --> 00:15:18,335
Tell me, what present do you want this year?

259
00:15:18,335 --> 00:15:20,564
Just give me something small, as you have in the past.

260
00:15:20,564 --> 00:15:21,656
How would that do?

261
00:15:21,656 --> 00:15:23,142
In the past, we didn't even celebrate it properly.

262
00:15:23,142 --> 00:15:25,371
This year, I definitely have to give you

263
00:15:25,371 --> 00:15:26,857
something really special!

264
00:15:28,854 --> 00:15:31,022
If, on my birthday,

265
00:15:31,022 --> 00:15:32,708
Jiejie can accompany me,

266
00:15:32,708 --> 00:15:34,520
that would be the best birthday present.

267
00:15:35,402 --> 00:15:36,595
But in the palace,

268
00:15:36,595 --> 00:15:39,349
how can the two of us meet so casually?

269
00:15:40,721 --> 00:15:43,672
Not to mention the ruckus over the Crown Prince has just died down.

270
00:15:43,672 --> 00:15:46,037
Eighth Prince rarely comes to the palace now either.

271
00:15:46,037 --> 00:15:51,099
Why cause more trouble for him for this bit of selfishness of mine, and cause other people's tongues to wag?

272
00:15:53,267 --> 00:15:55,185
Just give me something fun, it will be fine!

273
00:15:55,766 --> 00:15:57,298
You've been staying in the palace too long.

274
00:15:57,298 --> 00:15:59,899
You've picked up the bad habit of speaking with only 30% sincerity.

275
00:16:00,674 --> 00:16:02,360
It's only a birthday.

276
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,543
Actually, as long as you are all fine,

277
00:16:04,543 --> 00:16:06,168
then I'll be very happy.

278
00:16:07,863 --> 00:16:09,582
The rain has gone down.

279
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:11,068
Where are you going?

280
00:16:11,068 --> 00:16:12,229
I'm going to pick flowers.

281
00:16:12,229 --> 00:16:13,933
I'm taking advantage of these few days when I have spare time to pick more.

282
00:16:13,933 --> 00:16:15,651
Otherwise, if I miss it, then I'll have to wait until next year.

283
00:16:15,651 --> 00:16:17,184
You can't miss out on these flowers.

284
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:18,475
But don't forget:

285
00:16:18,475 --> 00:16:20,843
Pluck flowers as they bloom,
( Seize opportunities as they come, )

286
00:16:20,843 --> 00:16:23,398
don't wait till the flowers are gone, and you'll be left with twigs.
( hesitate and it will be gone. )

287
00:16:30,224 --> 00:16:31,803
What does that mean?

288
00:16:35,225 --> 00:16:36,294
Let's go!

289
00:16:42,586 --> 00:16:44,120
Tomorrow will be my birthday.

290
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:45,840
It's already been so many years.

291
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,040
Seems like going back is hopeless now.

292
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:53,760
From now on, I can only be Maertai Ruoxi.

293
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:59,760
Maertai Ruoxi, happy birthday.

294
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,040
Come in!

295
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,459
Greetings to Miss Ruoxi.

296
00:17:13,459 --> 00:17:16,019
Your servant, Caixia, is a palace maid serving Mistress Liang.

297
00:17:16,019 --> 00:17:18,680
Our mistress said that she happened across a handkerchief of yours,

298
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,080
and thought that the design was very exquisite.

299
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,900
After asking about, we found out that it was drawn by you.

300
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:24,939
She would like to ask you to go over to draw some for her.

301
00:17:24,939 --> 00:17:27,840
Sure, I'll go with you immediately.

302
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,040
Mistress Liang?

303
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,639
Isn't that Eighth Prince's mother?

304
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:53,660
Miss, you can go in by yourself then.

305
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:13,820
Greetings to Mistress Liang and Fujin.

306
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,600
Ruoxi,

307
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:19,720
I saw that the designs you drew were pretty good,

308
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,500
so I sent people to ask you over

309
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,980
to help me draw a few.

310
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,980
For Mistress Liang to have appreciated

311
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:27,020
my shoddy work,

312
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:28,520
that is my honor.

313
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:32,580
It's also rare for Ruolan to make a trip to the palace.

314
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:34,180
What a coincidence,

315
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:37,000
for you two sisters to have been able to meet.

316
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,080
Ruoxi,

317
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,420
you can go over there to paint.

318
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:43,560
Ruolan, go tell her what kinds of designs I like.

319
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:45,300
Yes, Mother.

320
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:54,840
Several days ago,

321
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,600
Eighth Prince sent people to tell me

322
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,780
to enter the palace to visit Concubine Liang

323
00:18:58,780 --> 00:18:59,920
and give my greetings to her.

324
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,600
I was still wondering,

325
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,480
today was neither the new year nor a holiday,

326
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,280
why did he specially have me enter the palace?

327
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:09,040
But I suddenly remembered

328
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:12,700
that your birthday was approaching, wasn't it?

329
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:13,800
So I knew

330
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,580
that I would surely be able to meet you.

331
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:18,120
So it was Eighth Prince who arranged it.

332
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,900
Oh right, Jiejie.

333
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:25,320
What kind of design does Mistress Liang like?

334
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:27,820
Those with fresh and elegant colors.

335
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:03,740
Ruoxi, turns out you've learned much since coming to the palace.

336
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:06,680
Originally, I'd thought that this was only an excuse,

337
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,460
but you paint wonderfully.

338
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:11,040
Then, Jiejie, do you like it?

339
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,720
Then I'll paint some for you too.

340
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:21,100
Lotus. Lotus suits you the best.

341
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:24,440
Sure.

342
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,580
Jiejie,

343
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:30,120
turns out the days when I stayed in Eighth Prince's residence

344
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,840
were the happiest.

345
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,680
theatres, fights

346
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,080
quarrelling with Tenth Prince,

347
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,880
being teased by Fourteenth Prince,

348
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,760
and kicking shuttlecock with the maids.

349
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,680
you are not happy right now?

350
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,480
I can't say that's the case either.

351
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,560
Actually,

352
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:53,400
His Majesty treats me very well as it is.

353
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,880
You've served by the emperor's side for so many years.

354
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:58,200
Do you have any plans for the future?

355
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,800
Is there anyone you like?

356
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:05,200
A few years ago, didn't you tell me

357
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,320
not to fall in love with anyone?

358
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:11,160
That was because a few years ago, you were about to enter the palace.

359
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:14,560
However, you didn't know if the emperor would choose you,

360
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:17,840
or whether he would bestow marriage upon you with some young prince/lord.

361
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:22,200
But now, you're grown up,

362
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,720
and a person valued by His Majesty.

363
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,600
You can always speak up for yourself.

364
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:32,120
women

365
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:34,500
should also think for themselves.

366
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:37,180
You can't be a palace maid for the rest of your life.

367
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:46,000
You're still wearing this.

368
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:54,720
If you truly like Thirteenth Prince,

369
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:58,000
then get him to ask His Majesty for permission to marry you.

370
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,720
Jiejie, you've misunderstood.

371
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,360
We are just bosom friends.

372
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:09,060
Then what about Tenth Prince?

373
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:11,560
He still thinks of you a lot.

374
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:14,400
It's not impossible between the two of you either.

375
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:18,800
But Tenth Fujin's a little...

376
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,480
But looking at it another way,

377
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,640
with your personality,

378
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:26,400
how could you be bullied by her?

379
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,520
Right?

380
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:30,040
For the sake of a man,

381
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:33,480
having to plot and scheme against another woman for the rest of my life,

382
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,360
I don't want it.

383
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:41,340
Then what about Fourteenth?

384
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,880
My good sister.

385
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,560
If I get married,

386
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,900
I have to marry someone that I love,

387
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:51,560
and who loves me wholeheartedly as well.

388
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:58,400
Jiejie,

389
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,880
you still cannot forget that general, right?

390
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:07,400
Even if I wanted to forget, I can't.

391
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:11,480
Then do you... still hate Eighth Prince?

392
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:14,760
I don't hate him.

393
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:19,020
But I will never be able to forgive him.

394
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:22,280
Back then, if he hadn't sent people to inquire,

395
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:27,600
some things would never have happened.

396
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:32,320
But he didn't do it on purpose either.

397
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,060
Jiejie.

398
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:40,080
how have you been these past few years?

399
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:44,120
The same as before.

400
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:48,000
Mistress asks if Miss Ruoxi has finished the paintings.

401
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,280
They're done.

402
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,200
These are pear blossoms.

403
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:08,680
But not many people embroider them on handkerchiefs.

404
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,080
Replying Mistress Liang,

405
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:14,520
this is from Qiu Chuji's "Without Worldly thoughts: Poem of Pear Blossoms at Lingxu Palace".

406
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:18,960
Naturally beautiful, with an air of nobility,

407
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:24,640
a pure noble spirit, displaying abundant qualities of those of an immortal.

408
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:27,720
I'm not deserving of such praise.

409
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:32,240
All of them have been drawn pretty nicely.

410
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:36,480
Ruoxi, you really are a clever person

411
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,680
Thank you, Mistress Liang, for your compliments.

412
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:43,560
That bracelet...

413
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:46,640
doesn't that belong to the Eighth Prince?

414
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:58,480
Cai Qin, take these designs, and find someone to embroider according to these designs.

415
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,120
Yes.

416
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,520
I will take my leave now.

417
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:17,140
Ruolan, I'm going to take a rest now.

418
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:19,240
Yes, Mother.

419
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:20,360
My feet are so disobedient.

420
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:21,200
Why is it I always

421
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:24,360
follow after him?

422
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:26,920
Eighth Prince...

423
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:30,760
Love him, I can't do it.

424
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:34,560
Not love him, yet I can't forget him.

425
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,680
What should I do?

426
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,920
Fourteenth Prince.

427
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,720
Where did you go?

428
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:55,680
You've waited for a long time? Did something happen?

429
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:57,560
To tell you the truth,

430
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:58,740
just now when I was at Imperial Mother's place,

431
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:01,160
I saw that both Fourth Brother and Thirteenth Brother were there,

432
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:03,360
so I didn't want to stay any longer.

433
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:08,800
Fourteenth Prince, let me brew a pot of fine tea for you.

434
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,680
All right.

435
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:19,200
Fourteenth Prince, please drink the tea.

436
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,220
It sure does taste bitter.

437
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:28,660
This is Da Hong Pao (a type of Oolong tea).

438
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:32,160
The tea you usually drink is green tea, which has a milder taste.

439
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:37,600
You're mad at Fourth Prince over the previous incident

440
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,160
of you pleading for leniency on behalf of Eighth Prince?

441
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:44,040
I'm not mad, I'm just chilled to the heart.

442
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:46,400
At that time, Imperial Father had taken out his sword, and was going to kill me.

443
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:50,280
The first one who ran up to hold down Imperial Father was Fifth Brother.

444
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:53,540
Although Fifth Brother and Ninth Brother are brothers born from the same mother,

445
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:56,080
usually, he doesn't hang out with us.

446
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:58,720
But at my moment of mortal peril,

447
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:02,140
my own biological brother just coolly looked on from the sidelines.

448
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:03,600
But I heard

449
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,500
that Fourth Prince had also knelt to pray for forgiveness.

450
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:08,200
In the end, which prince didn't kneel?

451
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:11,020
Although I grew up playing with Eighth Brother,

452
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:13,960
and am not close to him, still...

453
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:21,160
Back then, both he and Eighth Brother were given the title of Bei'le at the same time.

454
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:23,840
But he's already a Qin'wang.

455
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:25,920
Seek advantages and avoid disadvantages.

456
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:28,640
There's no one who does it better than Fourth Brother.

457
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,480
The personalities of both you brothers,

458
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,220
one's confident and easygoing,

459
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:34,460
the other, gloomy and unpredictable.

460
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:37,400
And you two brothers didn't grow up together either.

461
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,720
It's no wonder as well.

462
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:44,800
Yesterday, I met Jiejie.

463
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,660
Thanks to you and Eighth Prince.

464
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:49,500
Using tea in lieu of wine, I'll make a toast to you.

465
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:51,680
I should be the one toasting the birthday girl.

466
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,020
Ruoxi,

467
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:03,760
what exactly is going on in your mind?

468
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:06,800
Isn't what Eighth Brother has done these past few years enough?

469
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:10,300
He has totally become an infatuated man.

470
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:11,840
You don't know.

471
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,860
Originally, Eighth Prince had asked me to ask Mother

472
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:17,880
to do her best to remove you from the list of potential concubines,

473
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:20,440
and have you serve in Mother's palace.

474
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:22,740
Eighth Brother's mother, Concubine Liang,

475
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:25,840
because of her low status, she couldn't do it openly.

476
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:28,760
But behind the scenes, she must also have done as much as she could.

477
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:32,680
But in this case, I don't want to claim all the credit either.

478
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:35,200
Fourth Brother had also asked Mother for help on behalf of Thirteenth Brother.

479
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:39,940
Mother saw that this was one rare occasion when both of us actually had identical opinions,

480
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:42,520
so she agreed to it readily.

481
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:44,520
Then why...

482
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:48,480
after that, Mistress Hui requested for me too?

483
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,920
According to my guess,

484
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:53,880
it's just that that was the idea of Eighth Fu'jin and Tenth Fu'jin.

485
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,880
I just didn't expect that

486
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:58,920
because of this, you got assigned to serve by Imperial Father's side.

487
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:00,480
When Eighth Brother heard of this matter,

488
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,080
he was really anxious and furious.

489
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:04,600
For a good half a year, he didn't go to see Eighth Fu'jin.

490
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:08,280
Only later, when he saw that Imperial Father didn't have any (romantic) thoughts about you at all,

491
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:10,140
and saw that you were also very prudent and cautious,

492
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:12,240
did it get better.

493
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:14,000
After that,

494
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,240
Mistress Hui didn't make life difficult for me either.

495
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,500
Was that because of Eighth Prince as well?

496
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:22,100
Eighth Prince had originally been raised by Concubine Hui for a period  as well.

497
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:24,680
It isn't difficult for him to ask her for help either.

498
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:28,740
Ruoxi,

499
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:31,440
do you have Eighth Brother in your heart or not?

500
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:38,840
I don't know.

501
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:40,440
You still don't know?!

502
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:43,520
All these years, in fear that you would suffer a grievance,

503
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:47,500
Eighth Brother's quietly taken care of so many things for you behind the scenes, don't you know?

504
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:50,880
Otherwise, do you really think that life in the palace is so easy?

505
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,520
Ruoxi, just think about it.

506
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:56,640
These few years, Eighth Prince only has Difujin that he married some years ago,

507
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,360
and your sister, Cefujin.

508
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:01,320
Even the two servant concubines are the ones who have served him since young.

509
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:03,780
Which other prince do you see that is like him?

510
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:06,400
Now, all the men in the Forbidden City are all saying in private

511
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:09,560
that Eighth Brother is scared of his fierce wife, and doesn't dare to marry anymore.

512
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:11,720
Do you think that Eighth Brother is that kind of person?

513
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:15,040
How can the few of us brothers follow a man who's afraid of a woman?

514
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:18,160
Maertai Ruoxi, what on earth do you really want?

515
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:23,040
Fourth Prince and Thirteenth Prince are here.

516
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,760
No wonder you don't know.

517
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:38,740
Greetings to Fourth Prince. Greetings to Thirteenth Prince.

518
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:40,160
Rise.

519
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:44,560
We're here to get a cup of tea from the birthday girl.

520
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:10,800
The Da Hong Pao from the rocky cliff of Jiulong Ke on Mt. Wuyi?

521
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,800
It certainly lives up to its name.

522
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:16,700
No wonder even Fourteenth Brother comes over to drink tea.

523
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:18,480
Imperial Father sure treats her well.

524
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:21,280
Even the tea he gifts her is top grade.

525
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,580
Maertai Ruoxi,

526
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:29,400
what on earth do you really want?

527
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:33,240
I want a birthday present.

528
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:36,240
You've drunk my tea, so where's the present?

529
00:33:36,687 --> 00:33:39,060
Now here's someone asking for a present. I don't have one.

530
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:41,600
You don't? And you still dare to ask to drink tea?

531
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,840
What's there not to dare to do?

532
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:48,700
All right then, I still need to thank you.

533
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:50,300
There are loads of things you have to thank me for.

534
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:52,360
Which one are you thanking me for today?

535
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:55,240
Thank you for speaking up for me in front of Concubine De.

536
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,580
I wasn't the one who spoke.

537
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:59,080
If you want to thank, thank Fourth Brother.

538
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,600
Thank you, Fourth Prince.

539
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,200
Rise.

540
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:08,400
It's also because of you that Fourth Prince helped me.

541
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:11,120
That's why I still have to thank you.

542
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,840
Could I have not helped you?

543
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:15,560
With this temperament of yours, preferring death to dishonour,

544
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:17,720
who knew what kind of trouble you'd create?

545
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:20,080
I couldn't just stand by and act like it was nothing, could I?

546
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:24,620
To be able to have a bosom friend like you in my life, I'm content.

547
00:34:36,739 --> 00:34:39,320
Greetings to Fourth Prince. Greetings to Thirteenth Prince.

548
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:39,899
Rise.

549
00:34:39,899 --> 00:34:41,320
You can go inside first.

550
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,520
Yes.

551
00:34:43,799 --> 00:34:45,880
Ruoxi, since we've finished drinking the tea,

552
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:48,280
we should leave now too.

553
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:53,859
This is something Fourth Brother had Li Wei specially bring back

554
00:34:53,859 --> 00:34:55,840
when he sent him on an errand in the Northwest.

555
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:58,039
I took a look and there's nothing better (that I can offer).

556
00:34:58,039 --> 00:34:59,380
So I might as well not gift anything.

557
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:01,800
Just count me in (for this gift).

558
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:24,000
Eat more.

559
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,560
Thank you.

560
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:29,340
You should eat more too.

561
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:33,020
Jiejie, why did the two princes come here to drink tea today?

562
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:34,920
It's my birthday today.

563
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:38,160
Thirteenth Prince came over to give me a small gift.

564
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,880
Actually Jiejie and I share an affinity.

565
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,960
Our birthdays are on the same day.

566
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:51,960
Pity, I don't have the good fortune that Jiejie has.

567
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:57,800
Yutan, don't say that.

568
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:00,800
Come with me.

569
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:23,480
A late birthday present, I hope you don't blame me.

570
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:26,480
I can't take such a valuable gift.

571
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:31,040
Since you call me Jiejie, how can you not refuse my gift?

572
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:53,360
But I haven't given you anything for your birthday.

573
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:54,800
I don't know how to embroider.

574
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,880
Tomorrow, I'll draw up some designs,

575
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,320
Just focus

576
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,400
and properly sew a few handkerchiefs for me.

577
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,200
All right. As you wish.

578
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,840
Let's go for a walk.

579
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:09,332
Yutan, what are you thinking about?

580
00:37:09,332 --> 00:37:11,611
I miss my mother,

581
00:37:11,611 --> 00:37:14,108
younger brothers and sisters at home.

582
00:37:14,108 --> 00:37:16,170
No wonder you're so calm and steady.

583
00:37:16,170 --> 00:37:18,306
You're the eldest child.

584
00:37:18,306 --> 00:37:20,739
When we first met, I saw that you were more mature than the rest,

585
00:37:20,739 --> 00:37:23,182
had nimble hands and feet, and were meticulous.

586
00:37:23,182 --> 00:37:24,529
You're usually tight-lipped,

587
00:37:24,529 --> 00:37:26,800
never gossiping with the other palace maids.

588
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:29,480
That's why I've been keeping you by my side all this while.

589
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:31,223
Jiejie, you praise me too much.

590
00:37:31,223 --> 00:37:34,699
It's just that when one's poor, one gets the revelation that being adaptable is the only way to get out of one's situation.

591
00:37:34,699 --> 00:37:38,879
I've just been through a bit more than others, and have a better understanding of how to get along with others.

592
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,480
Honestly speaking,

593
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:43,569
I miss my parents a lot too.

594
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:49,040
Since entering the palace, for which of us has it been easy to see our families?

595
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:51,464
Jiejie already has it much better than us.

596
00:37:51,464 --> 00:37:53,554
Bei`le is Jiejie´s brother-in-law,

597
00:37:53,554 --> 00:37:56,108
and the princes usually treat Jiejie very well too.

598
00:37:56,108 --> 00:37:58,569
Even your birthday, there's someone who remembers it.

599
00:37:59,319 --> 00:38:02,600
In this palace, everyone is a master.

600
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:05,400
Who would remember a servant's birthday?

601
00:38:17,481 --> 00:38:21,035
We are under the same moon as our parents.

602
00:38:21,035 --> 00:38:24,840
Will our parents be able to see the same moon as we do?

603
00:38:25,997 --> 00:38:26,990
Jiejie,

604
00:38:26,990 --> 00:38:28,980
I want to kowtow to the moon,

605
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:32,124
and take it as though I'm kowtowing to my parents.

606
00:39:02,070 --> 00:39:03,640
Rise.

607
00:39:11,148 --> 00:39:13,709
I wanted peace and quiet tonight,

608
00:39:13,709 --> 00:39:16,113
so I didn't have someone to clear the way.

609
00:39:16,113 --> 00:39:17,700
I won't blame you for alarming me.

610
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:22,460
Just now, what were you praying for?

611
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:23,820
Your Majesty,

612
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:26,340
it's just that we servants were missing our parents.

613
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:28,980
We thought that since we're under the same moon,

614
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:31,460
we could pray in the direction of the moon,

615
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:34,200
and take it as if we'd prayed in front of our parents.

616
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,200
Yutan,

617
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,980
regular old people

618
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:04,520
usually have either a son

619
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:06,640
or a grandchild to accompany them to stroll.

620
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,560
But this person who refers to himself as the emperor,

621
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:12,040
is only accompanied by a eunuch.

622
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,380
That dragon chair (emperor's throne)

623
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:16,560
is like the jade hairpin of the Celestial Queen Mother.

624
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:19,060
Just a gentle stroke,

625
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:21,600
and it's separated him and his over twenty sons

626
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:23,320
on opposite sides of the river.

627
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:25,880
Jiejie is absolutely right.

628
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:36,560
Reporting to Your Majesty,

629
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:38,400
I have already written the report on the recent events

630
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,160
regarding the controversy surrounding the crown prince.

631
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:41,880
I've listed them all in this report.

632
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:43,600
Your Majesty, please review it.

633
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:45,720
Step down.

634
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:47,040
Yes, Your Majesty.

635
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,160
Li De Quan.

636
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:17,200
Your Majesty.

637
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:21,840
Make the arrangements for me to make an expedition outside of the Great Wall.

638
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:24,400
This time around,

639
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:28,100
I will be accompanied by the Crown Prince and the Eighth Prince.

640
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:31,320
Within the capital, all the court matters

641
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:33,920
will be handled by Fourth Prince.

642
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,220
And there will be Ninth Prince, Tenth Prince,

643
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:40,960
and Fourteenth Prince to assist by his side.

644
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,080
All the matters of the court

645
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:46,400
will be reported to me daily by messengers on fast horses.

646
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:52,040
Colluding with each other is forbidden,

647
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:54,440
as is forming factions.

648
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:55,800
Yes.

649
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,520
His Majesty is starting to be wary

650
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:07,040
of Eighth Prince's moves to gather a faction and consolidate power.

651
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:09,160
Everything that Eighth Prince is doing,

652
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:11,080
is making it impossible for Kangxi,

653
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:14,000
a sovereign who has had absolute control over everything, to condone it.

654
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,680
He doesn't feel at ease leaving him in the capital.

655
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:18,920
On the other hand,

656
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:21,240
ever since the Second Prince was reinstated as the Crown Prince,

657
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:23,120
his power and influence has been weakened.

658
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:25,920
With the help of those officials on his side,

659
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:28,280
he's started to actively solicit support from the other officials in court,

660
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:30,120
often conducting discussions in his residence.

661
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:32,680
This has also caused His Majesty to feel unsettled.

662
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,200
No wonder he has arranged for them

663
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:37,720
to accompany him on this expedition.

664
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:01,440
Ruoxi,

665
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:04,720
I kind of miss

666
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:06,520
the iced fruit juice you made during last year's expedition.

667
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:09,800
The cup for me was a chrysanthemum.

668
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:12,080
The Crown Prince's cup was a peony.

669
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:14,120
That's right.

670
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:16,140
The cup that I used

671
00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:17,880
was a peony design indeed.

672
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:19,940
Your son thinks of it a lot too.

673
00:43:19,940 --> 00:43:21,240
Not only did it look exquisite,

674
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:23,300
drinking it eased the heat as well.

675
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:24,540
Since Your Majesty misses it

676
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:26,040
I'll prepare it tomorrow.

677
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:27,120
Great.

678
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:32,180
Eighth Brother, this iced fruit juice

679
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:33,700
was really refreshing.

680
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:37,080
After drinking it, your whole body feels relaxed.

681
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:39,080
You'll have the luck of enjoying good food tomorrow.

682
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:40,400
- Yes.
- Ruoxi.

683
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:43,600
I remember that you requested to be allowed to learn how to ride.

684
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:44,960
How have your lessons gone?

685
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:47,040
With some difficulty, I have learned a little.

686
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:48,240
I'm allowing you to continue learning.

687
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:50,160
You must learn it well.

688
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,400
Thank you, Your Majesty.

689
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:57,820
Jiejie has the imperial edict,

690
00:43:57,820 --> 00:43:59,240
but hasn't gone riding.

691
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:01,280
Didn't you really like riding?

692
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:02,800
Why aren't you going to learn anymore?

693
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:04,640
Those soldiers teaching me to ride

694
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:07,320
will probably all be like Ni Man, and just go through the motions.

695
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:09,320
Their aim is not to teach me to learn how to ride,

696
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:11,280
but to ensure that nothing happens to me.

697
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:12,400
It's as good as not learning.

698
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:15,020
But you've gotten His Majesty's permission,

699
00:44:15,020 --> 00:44:16,880
wouldn't it be a pity to give up?

700
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:19,280
I'm a little tired these past few days.

701
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:21,080
I'll go learn after I've rested.

702
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:35,780
Fourth Prince's earnestness and concentration when he was teaching me.

703
00:44:35,780 --> 00:44:38,720
Why is it so clear in my mind?

704
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:40,480
His every move,

705
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:41,780
every word and action,

706
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:43,560
they are actually all etched into my mind in great detail.

707
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:49,540
We parted ways hastily the last time.

708
00:44:49,540 --> 00:44:50,600
This time,

709
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:52,320
we must enjoy ourselves to our heart's content.

710
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:56,400
With these words from you,

711
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:57,880
us brothers from the grasslands

712
00:44:57,880 --> 00:44:59,480
will definitely keep company all the way through,

713
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:02,360
and drink to the best of our abilities,

714
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:04,600
and have it such that both guest and hosts have the most fun.

715
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:07,120
Great. I'm very happy.

716
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:09,000
I'm willing to keep company even when playing drinking games.

717
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:11,580
Crown Prince,

718
00:45:11,580 --> 00:45:14,220
when we, men of the grasslands, drink and make merry,

719
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:16,180
we must also make sure that we find the right companions.

720
00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:18,180
When drinking with bosom friends, 1,000 cups aren't not enough,

721
00:45:18,180 --> 00:45:20,420
but if you don't get along, even half a word is too much.

722
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:23,440
Your Highness is magnanimous

723
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:24,840
You definitely won't mind petty trifles.

724
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:26,360
Everything can be forgiven over three cups of wine;

725
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:27,900
and when one gets drunk, all one's worries are gone.

726
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:31,340
Bei`le is good with words indeed.

727
00:45:31,340 --> 00:45:33,420
Since this is a joyous meeting,

728
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:35,900
we shan't fuss over the past anymore.

729
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:37,540
Good. For these words you said,

730
00:45:37,540 --> 00:45:40,020
I'm proposing a toast of three cups to you.

731
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:41,100
Good, good, good.

732
00:45:41,100 --> 00:45:43,380
Here.

733
00:46:02,180 --> 00:46:03,300
Ruoxi!

734
00:46:04,420 --> 00:46:05,620
I recognise you.

735
00:46:06,460 --> 00:46:07,580
Greetings to Princess Minmin.

736
00:46:07,580 --> 00:46:08,640
Your servant is Ruoxi indeed.

737
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:10,020
Rise.

738
00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:11,780
Do you have time to have a stroll with me?

739
00:46:13,620 --> 00:46:14,460
Sure.

740
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:19,580
Princess, why haven't you gone horseback riding?

741
00:46:19,580 --> 00:46:21,340
We can ride every day,

742
00:46:21,340 --> 00:46:23,960
unlike you people who stay in the Forbidden City,

743
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:25,740
who have to specially find a chance just to go riding.

744
00:46:25,740 --> 00:46:27,860
Do you ride well?

745
00:46:29,220 --> 00:46:30,820
You're asking the wrong person.

746
00:46:30,820 --> 00:46:32,180
It can't be considered whether or not I'm good.

747
00:46:32,180 --> 00:46:33,940
In fact, it may be pushing it to consider me as knowing how to ride.

748
00:46:33,940 --> 00:46:36,980
I thought only Han women don't know how to ride.

749
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:38,460
Why don't you know either?

750
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:40,260
It's true that I don't really know how to ride,

751
00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:41,500
but I really want to learn.

752
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:42,900
Then, let me teach you!

753
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:45,060
Although I've never taught anyone how to ride,

754
00:46:45,060 --> 00:46:46,380
I'll definitely teach you well!

755
00:46:48,260 --> 00:46:49,720
- All right.
- Let's go!

756
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:50,500
Don't be scared.

757
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:51,760
Who doesn't fall when riding horses?

758
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:52,980
I fell often when I was young too.

759
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:54,140
Sit tight!

760
00:47:04,620 --> 00:47:06,980
Ruoxi! Ruoxi!

761
00:47:06,980 --> 00:47:08,660
Hang on, Ruoxi!

762
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:18,420
Rouxi! Ruoxi!

763
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:19,780
Give your hand to me!

764
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:29,740
Are you all right?

765
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:39,360
♫  Stopping here, afraid to go any further ♫

766
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:45,980
♫  So sorrow will be unable to make an appearance  ♫

767
00:47:47,340 --> 00:47:52,780
♫  On the next page, the farewell penned by you,  ♫

768
00:47:53,510 --> 00:47:58,750
♫  it was not up to me to refuse  ♫

769
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:05,390
♫  We’ve walked down this path too hastily  ♫

770
00:48:06,180 --> 00:48:12,390
♫  Embracing desires that weren’t realistic  ♫

771
00:48:12,940 --> 00:48:18,720
♫  Not in time, wasn’t able to wait long enough to look back and admire  ♫

772
00:48:19,210 --> 00:48:24,250
♫  The fragrance of magnolia is unable to hide wounds  ♫

773
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:30,960
♫  No longer looking for the sunlight peeking through the clouds  ♫

774
00:48:30,990 --> 00:48:37,200
♫  No longer looking for the paradise that we promised each other  ♫

775
00:48:37,270 --> 00:48:44,050
♫  No longer sighing, you once said that life is unpredictable  ♫

776
00:48:44,100 --> 00:48:51,960
♫  The three inches of sunlight that I was unable to borrow  ♫

777
00:48:53,990 --> 00:49:00,210
♫  No longer looking for the sunlight peeking through the clouds  ♫

778
00:49:00,260 --> 00:49:06,540
♫  No longer looking for the paradise that we promised each other

779
00:49:07,170 --> 00:49:12,930
♫  No longer sighing, you once said that life is unpredictable  ♫

780
00:49:12,970 --> 00:49:19,320
♫  The three inches of sunlight that I was unable to borrow  ♫

781
00:49:19,910 --> 00:49:27,850
♫  That paradise is the place where I’d loved you  ♫
