Scarlet Heart
Episode 28

24
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:06,020
Wishing everything happens as you want, Eighth Brother.

25
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:08,140
Wishing for everything goes well for you, Eighth Brother.

26
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,540
I also wish you happiness forever.

27
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:13,660
Thank you, thank you. Please sit. Please sit.

28
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,500
- Li Fu!
- Yes!

29
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,020
Who is setting off firecrackers?

30
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,460
It's Little Master.

31
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:22,500
I said it before, nobody is allowed to set off firecrackers today.

32
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:23,860
Go stop him now.

33
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,580
Yes.

34
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:27,340
Eighth Brother, I say

35
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:29,100
there's no need for you to be this anxious.

36
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:31,380
Setting off firecrackers within your own household, who would know?

37
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:33,080
Ninth Brother, that's not the way to say it.

38
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,340
No walls are safe enough, to keep secrets from the outside.

39
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,460
So what if they get to know about it?

40
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:41,160
Since His Majesty, our father, did not even consider our father-son relationship before he died--

41
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:41,760
Ninth Brother.

42
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,540
I just want to say this.

43
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:45,660
As the saying goes, "No matter how vile a tiger is, he will not eat his own cub."

44
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:47,980
Think about it, how did His Majesty, our father, treat you before he died?

45
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:49,180
Did he even see you as his own son?

46
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:51,020
Don't say any more!

47
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:54,080
Ninth Brother.

48
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,820
Besides being filial piety,

49
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:58,820
it is also actually to avoid Fourth Brother going back on his own words.

50
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:01,340
Afraid of him attaining another possible opportunity to deal with us again.

51
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:04,100
But I still have some other things to tell you all.

52
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,100
Say it then.

53
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,900
Let's talk about it in the study.

54
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:13,260
Lady De Fei is indeed an understanding and smart person.

55
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:16,520
She was able to deal with Fourth Brother before you, completely disregarding his feelings.

56
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,780
It can be considered as a revenge for you.

57
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:20,540
What a pity, that I wasn't around when it all happened.

58
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:24,600
And failing to see the disheveled and disorientated look on Fourth Brother's face!

59
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,060
Ninth and Tenth Brothers, stop laughing.

60
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,160
Why can't we laugh?

61
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:31,280
Eighth Brother, this is the first piece of good news that I've received this year.

62
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,140
All of us should be happy!

63
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:33,760
That's right!

64
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,940
Fourth Brother

65
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:37,420
has already ripped Ah Ling's body into pieces.

66
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:42,260
This means that he knows the identity of the person who spread those rumors.

67
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:44,100
Eighth Brother is correct.

68
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:46,340
Fourth Brother hasn't made a move yet,

69
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:48,940
but that doesn't mean that he's letting go of that person.

70
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:51,860
We have to be more careful in the future.

71
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,540
So what if he knows?

72
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:55,940
If he was able to deal with us in the first place,

73
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:57,400
he already would have done so!

74
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:00,700
Do you really think he would have given us a chance?

75
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,620
He is deep in his thinking and in his plotting.

76
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:07,220
He never leaves a trace after executing his plans.

77
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:10,380
Maybe, he's already planned something and is executing it now in the dark.

78
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:13,460
Eighth Brother. What shall we do then?

79
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:15,100
What else can we do?

80
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:16,340
Since he knows

81
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:18,280
it was us who set up the trap years ago

82
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:20,020
and hasn't dealt with us yet...

83
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:21,879
There are only two possibilities.

84
00:04:21,879 --> 00:04:23,020
One,

85
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:25,179
there could still be some goodness and conscience in him.

86
00:04:25,179 --> 00:04:26,580
Stop dreaming.

87
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,100
Another possibility would be...

88
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,720
Our force and prowess is still evident,

89
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,940
which is why he dares not confront us directly.

90
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:40,180
Eighth Brother. Since everyone thinks highly of us,

91
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:43,020
why are you giving up on all this, instead?

92
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:44,100
Ninth Brother.

93
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:46,860
Eighth Brother knows what to do, in his heart.

94
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:51,620
Fourth Brother... Just like she had predicted,

95
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,340
is truly my nemesis.

96
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:58,420
Aunty!

97
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:00,500
Cheng Huan, slow down.

98
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,980
Thank you, Aunty. Aunty is the best!

99
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:05,620
Lady, the Emperor wants to see you.

100
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,620
Greetings, Your Majesty.

101
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:24,020
Rise.

102
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:25,780
Wang'ye,

103
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:28,300
it's better if you tell her personally.

104
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:31,940
Ruolan wants to see you.

105
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,140
Second Miss!

106
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:50,820
Second Miss! Second Miss!

107
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:52,580
Qiaohui.

108
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,060
Second Miss.

109
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:08,340
Don't cry anymore.

110
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,740
Ruolan is only worried about you now.

111
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:14,820
Try to stop her worries.

112
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,380
Jie'jie.

113
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,620
Jie'jie.

114
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:45,140
Am I dreaming?

115
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:48,900
No, you're not.

116
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:59,100
Just now, I dreamt of Mother.

117
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,740
What did Mother say?

118
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:07,940
Mother only smiled, smiled very beautifully.

119
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,380
When she was alive...

120
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:12,880
she frequently smiled like that.

121
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:17,820
Yes, very beautifully.

122
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:21,260
There you go starting to speak nonsense again.

123
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,820
When mother died...

124
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:26,420
you hadn't even been born for very long.

125
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:31,140
How is it possible that you could remember how she looked?

126
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:33,780
Mother isn't biased.

127
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:35,500
Whatever you can dream about,

128
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,920
I, naturally, am able to do so as well.

129
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:40,780
Come over here, and lay by my side. Will you?

130
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:43,420
I have a lot of things to tell you.

131
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:55,500
I know,

132
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:59,580
it won't be long before I get to see Mother again.

133
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:02,340
Sister.

134
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:07,660
Do you still remember the Northwest's Ge Wall?

135
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:13,540
I do. How could I possibly forget?

136
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,700
I haven't liked Beijing all this while.

137
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:20,260
Not a bit at all.

138
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:23,340
But whenever I close my eyes,

139
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:27,500
I'm able to see the blurry image of that wall.

140
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,160
Under the sunlight,

141
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:33,280
its icy mountains seem to give off a silvery glow.

142
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,740
And the Great Wall's red willows.

143
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:40,700
The alhagi that often tore our skirts.
(Alhagi - an Old World plant )

144
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:43,060
And the bad tasting

145
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:46,460
but irresistible silverberries.

146
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,940
Yes.

147
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:54,660
Once you've smelled their delicious scent,

148
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,920
you can't help but take a bite

149
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:59,900
and you regret it the moment you taste them.

150
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,080
But keeping it in your mouth,

151
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:05,000
there is no flavor at all.

152
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,740
I also miss the grapes.

153
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:14,620
Can Beijing's grapes still be considered grapes?

154
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:19,160
Thick skinned and not very sweet.

155
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,980
That's right.

156
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:23,300
Our grapes,

157
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:27,000
once you put them in your mouth and nibble softly,

158
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,060
your whole mouth is filled with sweetness

159
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:30,820
and the skin's already melted.

160
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:55,260
Little Sister, don't be sad.

161
00:10:56,060 --> 00:11:00,020
Your sister is now very happy.

162
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:03,460
Really happy.

163
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:06,940
I'm very happy because I was able to see Mother

164
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:08,860
and also Qing'shan.

165
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:13,480
Qing'shan?

166
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:16,180
The man in my sister's heart?

167
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,460
At first,

168
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:23,740
he didn't want to teach me how to ride a horse.

169
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:30,020
He thought I was too proud and a crybaby.

170
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:32,900
If not for my position,

171
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,940
he would never have wanted me as his disciple.

172
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:38,780
Sister loved to cry,

173
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:40,820
how could I not know that?

174
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:45,900
Yes. Mother left early.

175
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:50,880
Since I was small, I was always stubborn

176
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,380
and never wanted to be below anyone.

177
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:58,140
But I don't know why, but when I saw him

178
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:01,660
looking at me with his eyes full of laughter

179
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:05,580
at my poor skill in horse riding,

180
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,940
I couldn't help my tears.

181
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:14,660
I felt terribly wronged.

182
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:20,460
But later, he probably never dared to laugh at you again.

183
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:23,620
There wasn't a day when he didn't laugh at me.

184
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:28,300
He grew up drinking water from the marketplace.
(Means he grew up poor)

185
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:30,980
Mischievious, but...

186
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,580
but he was a bit learned,

187
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:39,300
so he was very blunt when he said something.

188
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:43,100
There are always 2 sides to everything.

189
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:45,700
There were always 2 sides to everything,

190
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:50,580
so he could always find fault in something.

191
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,620
You didn't get angry?

192
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:58,260
Of course, I got angry, but he would tell me

193
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:02,860
he loved to see my angry expression.

194
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,660
He said

195
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:09,820
only when I was angry, only then I became lively

196
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:13,260
like a young girl.

197
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:15,060
He said

198
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:18,260
I always followed the rules so closely,

199
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:22,900
like a refined wooden statue.

200
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:32,020
Sister, sleep a little first.

201
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:34,980
I still have so many things to tell you.

202
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:40,340
These last few years, my heart has had so many things

203
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:44,140
that after saying them all, it will feel so much better.

204
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:47,460
I'll be here accompanying you

205
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:51,660
and wait for you to get up to continue our talk.

206
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:25,220
You haven't eaten anything all day

207
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:27,060
so I've brought you some soup.

208
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:35,360
When Madam awakes, she will need you to take care of her.

209
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,000
If you don't eat,

210
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,780
where will you get the energy to care for her.

211
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:45,520
Fine.  When my sister wakes up,

212
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:46,220
you must tell me.

213
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:49,420
Don't worry, I've already told everyone.

214
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:56,020
Greetings Tenth Prince. Greetings Fourteenth Prince.

215
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,500
Rise.

216
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,060
We'll excuse ourselves.

217
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,620
Rouxi,

218
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:11,580
I'm going to Khalkha (Mongolia) the day after tomorrow.

219
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:12,620
Once I leave,

220
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:14,900
it'll probably be for at least a year.

221
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:17,100
I'm here to say farewell.

222
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:18,500
Why?

223
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,620
It's the Emperor's order, isn't it?

224
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:28,640
Rouxi, how are you lately?

225
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,720
You're with him for some unclear reason,

226
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,540
what is going on?

227
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,520
If he wants you, he should give you a title already.

228
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,720
If he doesn't want you,

229
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,580
then he should release you from the palace!

230
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:42,900
But now what are you?

231
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,260
Let's say you're just a palace maid,

232
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:48,320
but Gao Wu Yong (Head Eunuch) even has to bow his head to you.

233
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,120
But say you're a master,

234
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:52,900
what building are you master of?

235
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:57,140
I will never understand what you're thinking inside.

236
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:59,000
Women mostly think highly of their status,

237
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,580
but you don't think about it all.

238
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:02,220
Fourteenth Brother, don't say any more.

239
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:04,580
You think she doesn't have enough hardships yet?

240
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,580
Eat a little bit first.

241
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:41,420
Last month, Ninth Brother

242
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:43,820
was sent to XiNing  (Tibet).

243
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,220
Tenth Brother's going to Mongolia the day after tomorrow.

244
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:53,420
I believe the next one to go

245
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:55,000
will be me.

246
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,140
I don't know where he plans to send me

247
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:59,060
for him to feel reassured.

248
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:02,240
Rouxi... have you ever thought of leaving the palace?

249
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:06,160
Fourteenth Brother, this isn't something that she can decide freely.

250
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,580
Not just her, but we

251
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:12,780
also can't do everything freely anymore.

252
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:15,180
However, Rouxi,

253
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:17,360
right now, I really want to know

254
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:22,520
have you ever thought to yourself if you would leave or not?

255
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:27,259
I don't know.

256
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:32,380
There are times I wanted to.

257
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:36,080
Sometimes... I don't want to.

258
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,100
I think it is because of him.
(4th Prince)

259
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:43,900
Second Miss.

260
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,360
Madam is awake.

261
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:50,020
Rouxi...

262
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:51,840
Do you still remember a few years ago

263
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,820
the things I said to you?

264
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:00,020
Nevermind. Go ahead in.

265
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:22,580
Sister, why aren't you lying down?

266
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,780
You've come.

267
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:30,100
Tell me which one looks better.

268
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:43,820
This is very good. It matches your earrings.

269
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:50,240
This pair of earrings is from Qing Shan.

270
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,540
If I were to wear them,

271
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:54,700
he would be very happy.

272
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:59,940
Yes, he would be very happy.

273
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:14,140
Which outfit does Madam want to wear?

274
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:16,820
The lake green riding outfit.

275
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:34,720
Jie'jie, are you tired?

276
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,980
Go rest a little more.

277
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:39,220
And the deerskin boots.

278
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:44,140
Sit down.

279
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,860
What do you think?

280
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:17,180
Is it pretty? Is it?

281
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:26,980
- Jie'jie!
- Madam!
- Jie'jie!

282
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:28,500
- Jie'jie!
- Madam!

283
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:38,060
Jie'jie!... Jie'jie.

284
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:40,020
I really like...

285
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:43,540
at sunset,

286
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:50,460
the beauty of the falling sun on the Gobi.

287
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:55,340
Half the sky is colored in red...

288
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,900
He would ride his horse.

289
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:02,900
Laughing, watching

290
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:08,580
my hair reflecting the sun's glow.

291
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:13,320
I felt like my whole body was ablaze.

292
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,380
Rouxi...

293
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:19,180
I really really want to go back there.

294
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:25,880
Qing Shan... Where is he?

295
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:28,620
He is definitely waiting for you.

296
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:36,940
But I'm... a bit afraid.

297
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:38,740
What are you afraid of?

298
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:44,420
My whole life, I've been part of the Aisin Gioro clan.

299
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:48,360
I don't want to be their ghost as well.

300
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:51,040
I'm afraid if I pass over to the underworld,

301
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:55,660
they won't let Qing Shan and I meet again.

302
00:21:55,660 --> 00:22:00,060
Jie'jie... wait for me a bit.

303
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,060
Where are you going?

304
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:08,060
I will come back.

305
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:31,200
What is this about?

306
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,400
I beg you to divorce my sister.

307
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:48,700
Was this Ruolan's decision?

308
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:51,800
The granting and taking away of titles, are only given by the Emperor.

309
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,020
One can't just divorce easily!

310
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,920
I will beg the Emperor,

311
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:02,300
but it'll take me a while to get back to the palace.

312
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:05,020
I just hope you can agree to this plea.

313
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:10,460
My sister's been shut up in this manor her whole life.

314
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:14,660
She's scared that she won't ever be granted her freedom, even after death.

315
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:19,080
You must have known that my sister's heart was never by your side.

316
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:21,500
They've been separated for over 20 years.

317
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,820
I beg you to let my sister be free,

318
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:27,620
so she can be at ease to find her lover.

319
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:31,520
Rouxi, let's talk after you stand up first.

320
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:34,060
A prince divorcing his wife is a huge issue.

321
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:35,540
The Emperor has to agree,

322
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:38,280
otherwise, he will be punished.

323
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:39,900
Punished?

324
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:43,180
He doesn't need a valid excuse to be punished.

325
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:44,980
If he really wants to find fault,

326
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:46,820
he doesn't have to do anything.

327
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:48,120
He will be punished anyway.

328
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:50,100
Eighth Sister-in-Law.

329
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:04,260
Let's fulfill Ruolan's wish.

330
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,500
Take it.

331
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:22,500
Thank you, Fu'jin.

332
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:24,540
You don't need to thank me.

333
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,920
I'm only doing it for myself.

334
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:34,740
My whole life, I had hoped to be your sister's rival,

335
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:38,700
but didn't realize she never even tried.

336
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:46,620
This is the greatest joke heaven has played on me.

337
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:52,100
I actually spent my life fighting with someone in my imagination.

338
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:56,200
I don't want to fight with her even after death.

339
00:26:57,100 --> 00:27:04,060
If she wants to leave, I'm very happy. I'll send her off with all my heart.

340
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:20,740
"I followed the Imperial edict to marry Lady Maertai Ruolan.

341
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:23,140
After many years of marriage,

342
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:25,460
nothing has come out of it.

343
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:28,020
According to the 7-rule guide of divorce,

344
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:32,180
I write this divorce letter, to let her remarry,

345
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:34,940
with no false words."

346
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:41,140
Was this personally written by the Eighth Prince?

347
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:51,220
Do you think Rouxi would lie to Sister?

348
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:06,320
Qing Shan, do you see it?

349
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:10,760
I am no longer belong to the Aisin Gioro clan.

350
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:17,700
I want to go with you to see

351
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:21,340
the red willow that we both planted.

352
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:28,420
I want to drink some more fresh snow water from the mountain stream.

353
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:39,540
Let's go horse riding... together...

354
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:54,700
Madam!

355
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:21,500
Madam!

356
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:08,940
Your heart is hurting.

357
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:11,900
My heart is also hurting like yours.

358
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:15,940
I know my place in your heart is not the same as Ruolan,

359
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:17,820
but my prince,

360
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:23,380
I will always be true to you, I'll never forsake you.

361
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:25,360
If you want to cry,

362
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:28,460
I'll cry with you.

363
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:31,740
If you're in pain,

364
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:36,020
I'll also be in pain with you.

365
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:39,900
You are never alone.

366
00:30:55,580 --> 00:31:02,380
Eighth Prince, lay all the burdens down.

367
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:14,900
Rouxi.

368
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:18,440
What I have promised you, I've already done them.

369
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:21,160
But this I can't promise you.

370
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:25,680
I've already taken your sister's name off of the Royal Family's record.

371
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:28,640
Your sister's body will be taken home to lay at rest.

372
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,920
I also sent a decree to your father to secretly

373
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:34,660
bury your sister with Qing Shan.

374
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:44,060
What I can do, I have already done.

375
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:48,780
Then why won't you let me personally take my sister back home?

376
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:52,380
This is not a big thing to grant.

377
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:00,700
It's because I'm afraid.

378
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:05,040
I'm scared once you leave,

379
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:07,300
you won't ever come back.

380
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:15,520
I know that you are very much like your sister.

381
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:18,320
You both don't like this Forbidden City.

382
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:23,560
I'm afraid that once you return to the home you dream of,

383
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:26,460
your heart will never return here.

384
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:37,200
Rouxi... trust me.

385
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,620
Your father and your little brother

386
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:41,540
will take care of everything.

387
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:56,280
I'll let them bring in some food now.

388
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:01,580
Is Qiao'hui all right?
(Roulan's personal maid)

389
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:05,560
She's with Thirteenth Prince,

390
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:08,000
so you can be 120% relaxed.

391
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:11,180
Of course, I know,

392
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:14,900
her staying at Thirteenth Prince's manor, he will certainly take care of Qiao Hui's future.

393
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:18,580
But I'm worried about how she's feeling.

394
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:20,960
She grew up with my sister,

395
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,660
they were close for so many years.

396
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:25,340
Now that my sister's gone,

397
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:28,420
she's all of a sudden alone.

398
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:31,740
There's no reason for her to stay at the Eighth's manor.

399
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:34,340
To lose a loved one

400
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:37,620
and out of nowhere end up in Thirteenth's unfamiliar manor,

401
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:40,860
grieving and alone,

402
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:43,980
I'm afraid no one will understand how she's feeling right now.

403
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:56,860
Aunty. Aunty.

404
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:59,420
Aunty, are you feeling better now?

405
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:00,580
I'm well.

406
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:04,100
Imperial Uncle didn't want me to see you.

407
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:06,920
He said that Gu' Gu wasn't feeling well and was upset.

408
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:10,700
But once Gu Gu saw me, she smiled!

409
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:14,380
Are you all right now that you've seen me?

410
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:17,580
Seeing Cheng Huan, I'm not sad anymore.

411
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:19,740
Imperial Uncle, did you hear that?

412
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:22,339
Next time you can't keep me from seeing Gu' Gu.

413
00:34:22,339 --> 00:34:25,300
Fine, sit down.

414
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:31,840
Want to play rock-paper-scissors?

415
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,740
Good.

416
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:37,899
Rock... Paper... Scissors, shoot!

417
00:34:37,899 --> 00:34:39,660
You cheated!

418
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:42,380
Rock... Paper... Scissors, shoot!

419
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:11,560
Rouxi, if you see someone you love

420
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:16,400
make sure you protect and treasure your love,

421
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:20,220
or else when it is gone

422
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:23,340
you will regret it.

423
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:27,700
Jie'jie...

424
00:35:59,226 --> 00:36:01,180
You finished all the Imperial documents?

425
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,300
I want to have you.

426
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,660
You don't have to worry.

427
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:40,100
I will wait until your heart is willing.

428
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,340
Do you remember once we said

429
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:55,200
we have to be honest with each other?

430
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,780
Then can you tell me,

431
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:05,140
what do I have to do so you won't deny me?

432
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:09,548
Ever since you moved into Yan'xin palace,

433
00:37:09,548 --> 00:37:13,460
I feel that you have been cold and resisting me.

434
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:18,060
That's why I've been afraid of wanting to have you.

435
00:37:27,542 --> 00:37:29,064
But do you know?

436
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,661
When I saw you  playing with Cheng Huan laughing together with such happiness,

437
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:37,140
I don't want to wait any longer.

438
00:37:39,461 --> 00:37:41,860
I want you to have children for me.

439
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:44,740
I want to see you laughing happily together with them.

440
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:47,380
That would be the biggest happiness in my heart.

441
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:53,180
I know many things

442
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:57,420
cannot be measured by right or wrong. I resist because I know everyone's ending.

443
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:02,840
I want to become the Empress.

444
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:08,040
This matter I cannot promise you.

445
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:18,640
I've been married to the Empress since we were very young.

446
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:20,132
After so many years,

447
00:38:20,132 --> 00:38:22,446
she has never done anything bad.

448
00:38:23,461 --> 00:38:26,460
Also, her child died very young,

449
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:29,040
so she doesn't have any children now.

450
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,180
I cannot hurt her.

451
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:35,060
I don't want you to go to see Nian Fei either.

452
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:41,480
Do you really have to give me so much trouble?

453
00:38:42,369 --> 00:38:44,700
Is it because of Nian Geng Yao?

454
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:48,585
She wanted to marry me herself,

455
00:38:48,585 --> 00:38:50,200
she's not in the wrong.

456
00:38:53,293 --> 00:38:55,900
Then what promise are you going to give to me?

457
00:39:00,692 --> 00:39:03,440
Sometimes, I ask myself,

458
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,920
what do I really have?

459
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:09,100
Because of me, Thirteenth Brother was imprisoned for 10 years.

460
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:14,020
Back then, he could fight a tiger,

461
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:16,660
but now his body's weak and he's constantly sick.

462
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:20,364
He's younger than me

463
00:39:20,364 --> 00:39:22,361
and yet his body's weaker than mine.

464
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:26,740
You're not much better.

465
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:31,835
Sometimes, I'm afraid of thinking about these things in detail,

466
00:39:33,973 --> 00:39:36,380
because I really am afraid.

467
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:39,899
Now I own the entire world,

468
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:43,800
but all this means nothing to you.

469
00:39:44,918 --> 00:39:47,300
What I can give you

470
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:50,302
is my heart.

471
00:39:53,363 --> 00:39:55,031
Do you know

472
00:39:55,031 --> 00:39:57,960
why even up to now, I have not given you an official title?

473
00:39:59,493 --> 00:40:02,700
Because in this place, I can see you all the time.

474
00:40:03,262 --> 00:40:05,441
Once you have an official title,

475
00:40:05,441 --> 00:40:08,220
if I want to see you,

476
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:12,620
I would need to flip over your name tablet.

477
00:40:15,669 --> 00:40:17,540
But the way it is currently,

478
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:19,884
I can see you every day.

479
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:22,052
Do you understand?

480
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:26,100
Are you still going to refuse me?

481
00:41:30,716 --> 00:41:33,570
Give me the ball! Give me! Give it to me!

482
00:41:36,846 --> 00:41:39,620
Give it to me! Give it!

483
00:41:44,355 --> 00:41:47,260
This children are really happy

484
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:51,740
Yes. This is their most happy time

485
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:53,060
Once they're grown up

486
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:54,746
they'll have lots of rules to abide by.

487
00:41:54,746 --> 00:41:56,820
Then they'll be really bothered.

488
00:41:57,540 --> 00:42:00,435
What are you talking about? What rules?

489
00:42:00,435 --> 00:42:02,740
What do you women normally teach them?

490
00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:04,229
Nothing much

491
00:42:04,229 --> 00:42:06,860
besides singing and telling stories.

492
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:09,120
I should ask Cheng'huan.

493
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:10,691
I'm afraid your stories

494
00:42:10,691 --> 00:42:14,820
aren't as simple as Si Ma Guan and Kong Zi.  (children's stories)

495
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:18,308
Your Majesty, Eunuch Gao just came with a report.

496
00:42:18,308 --> 00:42:20,340
General Nian and Lonkodo are waiting

497
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:21,621
with important issues to discuss.

498
00:42:21,621 --> 00:42:24,304
Right now, they're waiting at Yanxin palace.

499
00:42:24,304 --> 00:42:27,822
Understood.

500
00:42:27,822 --> 00:42:30,220
Then I'm going first.

501
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:48,180
Why don't you take Chang Huan home too?

502
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:49,555
After a while,

503
00:42:49,555 --> 00:42:50,901
father and daughter will become more familiar

504
00:42:50,901 --> 00:42:52,940
and you will become closer.

505
00:42:56,070 --> 00:42:57,420
No need.

506
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:01,080
I'm afraid even if I bring her home,

507
00:43:01,622 --> 00:43:04,500
I won't know how to face her.

508
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:08,516
Oh, I heard

509
00:43:08,516 --> 00:43:11,908
you're troubled by Imperial brother sending Fourteenth to ZunHua

510
00:43:11,908 --> 00:43:13,580
to guard the Imperial tombs.

511
00:43:15,941 --> 00:43:19,546
Maybe to Fourteenth Brother,

512
00:43:19,546 --> 00:43:21,140
it's not a bad thing.

513
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,140
Do you really think so?

514
00:43:25,722 --> 00:43:26,837
I wish

515
00:43:26,837 --> 00:43:28,834
I could exchange places with him.

516
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:32,751
Imperial Brother sending him to guard tombs at ZunHua

517
00:43:32,751 --> 00:43:34,662
just since he doesn't want him wandering everywhere.

518
00:43:34,662 --> 00:43:38,827
He's being well provided for, although it can't compare to living here in the city,

519
00:43:38,827 --> 00:43:40,900
but it's not far away.

520
00:43:41,714 --> 00:43:43,639
But he's still young

521
00:43:43,639 --> 00:43:47,247
and used to being a successful general in the Northwest.

522
00:43:47,247 --> 00:43:49,383
To be a guard for tombs

523
00:43:49,801 --> 00:43:53,834
must be very unsatisfying for him.

524
00:43:53,834 --> 00:43:56,482
Imperial Brother really doesn't want you to know these things,

525
00:43:56,482 --> 00:43:59,368
especially anything regarding Eighth and Tenth.

526
00:43:59,368 --> 00:44:01,780
He doesn't want to see you worried.

527
00:44:01,780 --> 00:44:03,083
I heard from Imperial Brother,

528
00:44:03,083 --> 00:44:05,173
you have to eat medicine every day.

529
00:44:05,173 --> 00:44:07,216
If you're troubled by these things,

530
00:44:07,216 --> 00:44:09,120
then all of Imperial Brother's efforts

531
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:10,746
will be wasted.

532
00:44:11,212 --> 00:44:14,440
Besides, they're all brothers,

533
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:16,124
everything will still be fine.

534
00:44:16,124 --> 00:44:19,685
The worst is to be put on house arrest.

535
00:44:20,754 --> 00:44:22,480
I understand.

536
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:23,826
And now,

537
00:44:23,826 --> 00:44:25,515
because of Fourteenth, the Empress Dowager isn't talking to Imperial Brother

538
00:44:25,515 --> 00:44:30,020
and doesn't allow anyone to call her "Empress Dowager".

539
00:44:30,020 --> 00:44:31,753
Also, she's now very sick,

540
00:44:31,753 --> 00:44:34,625
but she still only longs for Fourteenth.

541
00:44:34,625 --> 00:44:41,120
Imperial Brother is facing a lot of resistance to the new regulations he's trying to introduce.

542
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:43,220
If Fourteenth was here,

543
00:44:43,220 --> 00:44:46,474
you know his personality, he wouldn't make the Emperor's job easy.

544
00:44:46,474 --> 00:44:49,820
In front of all the officials, he would openly voice opposition to Imperial Brother.

545
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:51,915
How could the Son of Heaven be respected then?

546
00:44:51,915 --> 00:44:54,165
How would the officials accept him?

547
00:44:54,165 --> 00:44:57,260
If Fourteenth is used by someone with evil intentions,

548
00:44:57,260 --> 00:44:59,552
the result could be even more disastrous.

549
00:45:04,820 --> 00:45:08,197
Ruoxi... in some things

550
00:45:08,197 --> 00:45:10,898
there's nothing you can do.

551
00:45:10,898 --> 00:45:12,302
Just let it go.

552
00:45:25,123 --> 00:45:28,727
Your majesty, the officials are very dissatisfied.

553
00:45:28,727 --> 00:45:30,924
I've met with them one by one

554
00:45:30,924 --> 00:45:32,503
and put pressure on them.

555
00:45:33,132 --> 00:45:37,500
The country's borders, thanks to  Your Majesty, don't appear to have any problems at present.

556
00:45:38,387 --> 00:45:40,944
What about Prince Yan?

557
00:45:40,944 --> 00:45:44,420
I've already sent out spies.

558
00:45:44,420 --> 00:45:45,740
Good.

559
00:45:46,157 --> 00:45:49,129
Majesty, granting the title to Empress Dowager

560
00:45:49,129 --> 00:45:51,104
cannot be delayed any further.

561
00:45:51,104 --> 00:45:53,944
The later you don't grant Consort De the Empress Dowager title,

562
00:45:53,944 --> 00:45:57,460
the more the rumors will persist.

563
00:45:59,780 --> 00:46:03,500
Ever since Imperial Father passed, Imperial Mother

564
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:05,604
has fallen sick.

565
00:46:05,604 --> 00:46:07,983
I've already told her many times.

566
00:46:07,983 --> 00:46:10,860
But she just keeps delaying it.

567
00:46:11,645 --> 00:46:17,260
Your Majesty, this has already become a rumor.

568
00:46:17,260 --> 00:46:18,325
According to it,

569
00:46:18,325 --> 00:46:23,541
Your Majesty didn't rightfully gain the throne because even Consort De does not recognize you.

570
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:26,831
Emperor! Emperor! Emperor!

571
00:46:26,831 --> 00:46:28,495
De'Fei's illness is very severe.

572
00:46:28,495 --> 00:46:31,389
I'm afraid she might not make it through.

573
00:46:38,210 --> 00:46:42,960
♫  Stopping here, afraid to go any further ♫

574
00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:49,390
♫  so sorrow will be unable to make an appearance  ♫

575
00:46:50,930 --> 00:46:55,930
♫  On the next page, the farewell penned by you,  ♫

576
00:46:57,030 --> 00:47:01,910
♫  it was not up to me to refuse  ♫

577
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:09,080
♫  We’ve walked down this path too hastily  ♫

578
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:15,920
♫  Embracing desires that weren’t realistic  ♫

579
00:47:16,690 --> 00:47:21,860
♫  Not in time, wasn’t able to wait long enough to look back and admire  ♫

580
00:47:23,100 --> 00:47:27,970
♫  The fragrance of magnolia is unable to hide wounds  ♫

581
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:34,460
♫  No longer looking for the sun’s rays peeking through the clouds  ♫

582
00:47:34,950 --> 00:47:40,580
♫  No longer looking for the paradise that we promised each other  ♫

583
00:47:41,420 --> 00:47:47,280
♫  No longer sighing, you once said that life is unpredictable  ♫

584
00:47:47,850 --> 00:47:55,450
♫  The three inches of sunlight that I was unable to borrow  ♫

585
00:47:57,520 --> 00:48:03,750
♫  No longer looking for the sunlight peeking through the clouds  ♫

586
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:10,150
♫  No longer looking for the paradise that we promised each other  ♫

587
00:48:10,670 --> 00:48:16,680
♫  No longer sighing, you once said that life is unpredictable  ♫

588
00:48:17,140 --> 00:48:22,810
♫  The three inches of sunlight that I was unable to borrow  ♫

589
00:48:23,590 --> 00:48:31,910
♫  That paradise is the place where I’d loved you  ♫
