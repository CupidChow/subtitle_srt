3
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:24,050
♫  We were destined to seek our doom like moths flying towards the flame  ♫

♫  Only like this can I not be in love with you  ♫

7
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:47,590
♫  Just another brushing of the shoulder, and from then...♫

♫  I’ll keep falling deeper and deeper in love with you  ♫

♫ forcing us to pass each other by  ♫

Scarlet Heart
Episode 19

24
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:21,020
[ Royal Throne ]

25
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:30,540
Do you want it?

26
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:36,140
You don't have to answer.

27
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:37,340
I do.

28
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:39,580
Have you told anyone?

29
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:40,660
You're the first one.

30
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,460
What about 13th Prince?

31
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,860
13th Prince and I grew up together.

32
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:48,060
What I am thinking can't be hidden from him.

33
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,060
I don't need to tell him.

34
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:51,960
Aren't you scared

35
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,160
that I'll tell others?

36
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:01,040
The bet you placed was too big.

37
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,500
Although I didn't want to gamble,

38
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:08,160
I was afraid that if I missed this chance,

39
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,480
you'd keep your heart

40
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,020
closed too tightly.

41
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,200
If I missed this chance,

42
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:16,580
I didn't know if there would be another one.

43
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:23,260
Telling others

44
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:25,740
you wouldn't do.

45
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:29,560
Even the Emperor was never suspicious of you.

46
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:32,520
Why are you telling me now?

47
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:34,600
Am I hallucinating?

48
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:38,000
All right.

49
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:40,840
Then let me ask you.

50
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:47,340
What does 4th prince wish to know?

51
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:51,960
I want to know,

52
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,320
did that kick hurt?

53
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:58,060
Scared me again.

54
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,380
It doesn't hurt, but it isn't a light injury.

55
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:03,240
It is a mild pain.

56
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,480
Yutan has already helped me apply medicine.

57
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,540
It's not a big deal.

58
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,060
This medicine,

59
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:15,400
use it once every morning and night.

60
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,980
It won't affect the medicine you've applied externally.

61
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,460
By the way,

62
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:23,140
what did Imperial Father say to you

63
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:24,860
to turn you so strange?

64
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,279
You didn't even greet us when you saw us.

65
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:29,340
Yesterday, His Majesty asked to see me

66
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:31,900
to ask why 10th Prince and Fujin were fighting

67
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:33,600
and

68
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,520
how I advised 10th prince.

69
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,200
Later,

70
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,880
His Majesty said something

71
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,560
I don't understand.

72
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:43,960
What did he say?

73
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:46,020
He asked me

74
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:48,100
if in the future, can I

75
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:49,840
forget what I have lost

76
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,300
and value what I have.

77
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:54,460
How did you answer?

78
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:59,120
I said I didn't know.

79
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:02,120
Before I understand what His Majesty is thinking,

80
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,040
I can only say that

81
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:05,880
I think

82
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:09,400
Imperial Father thinks you like 13th Brother.

83
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:11,620
Is it because of the time

84
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:13,500
I competed with Minmin?

85
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,080
Probably is.

86
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:17,980
Minmin's reactions to 13th Brother

87
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:19,140
were so strange,

88
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,320
Imperial Father would connect it

89
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,900
to a relationship between lovers.

90
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:26,760
What did Guwalgiya Wang'ye

91
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,600
say to His Majesty

92
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:31,440
so that His Majesty did not pursue the matter?

93
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:34,940
Didn't you wonder before?

94
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:38,640
Wang'ye would definitely tell His Majesty the truth

95
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,640
about Minmin's feelings for 13th Prince.

96
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:42,040
But afterward,

97
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,420
he must have said something

98
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:44,480
about not letting Minmin

99
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,340
marry 13th Prince

100
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:48,120
and convinced His Majesty

101
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,780
to agree to Minmin and Prince Zuoying.

102
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:52,980
As to why His Majesty would

103
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:55,720
allow Minmin and Prince Zuoying,

104
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,240
not only do I not understand,

105
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,280
I think it was a mistake.

106
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,900
It's all right for His Majesty to allow the marriage between the two tribes,

107
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:05,620
but he also secretly supported Prince Zuoying to fight for his inheritance.

108
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:07,320
Yinerganzhuluo's 1st Prince's

109
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,780
twin sister

110
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:11,000
is Nalanbu's new Imperial concubine.

111
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,960
Do you understand now?

112
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:15,260
I understand

113
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:17,220
to even out the power of the tribes

114
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:18,820
by letting them fight

115
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,320
amongst themselves.

116
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,340
In the end, no one will be in command.

117
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,500
Correct.

118
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:25,320
This is why Imperial Father

119
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:29,020
agreed with Minmin and Prince Zuoying's marriage.

120
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,680
It's too complicated.

121
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,820
I just know that Minmin marrying 13th Prince

122
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:36,500
is more advantageous than her marrying Prince Zuoying.

123
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:38,360
Do you think

124
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,660
the Emperor is wrong?

125
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:40,940
Years ago,

126
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:42,620
people said I fancied 10th Prince

127
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:45,840
Now, they say I fancy the 13th Prince.

128
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,760
I don't think

129
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,200
you would fancy 10th Brother.

130
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,420
But

131
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:50,900
I'm surprised

132
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:52,240
you don't fancy 13th Brother.

133
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,480
His Majesty's words

134
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,780
aren't they

135
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:58,400
to grant my wish

136
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,000
or not?

137
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:01,920
Ruoxi,

138
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,980
Imperial Father really dotes on you.

139
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:06,380
From what you're saying, Imperial Father's words

140
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:08,020
in any event relating to you, he is really

141
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:09,280
hesitating.

142
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:13,440
He really cares for how you feel.

143
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:19,640
Then, in the future, would His Majesty agree?

144
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:25,580
Shy?

145
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:28,520
No.

146
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:45,500
After the Crown Prince's incident settles down

147
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,840
I'll ask Imperial Father.

148
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,860
I think that with our feelings,

149
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:53,260
he will agree.

150
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:55,760
Don't waste energy

151
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,320
wondering about these things.

152
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:00,100
Although your marriage is a bit problematic,

153
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:00,940
as long as

154
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:02,940
it doesn't involve taking the throne,

155
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,000
I believe that Imperial Father

156
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,480
will let us be together.

157
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:07,700
If you really have time,

158
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:10,140
then think about something meaningful.

159
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:14,060
Then, what is it, that's meaningful?

160
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:17,940
For example, for my birthday

161
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:19,780
what song will you sing to me

162
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:22,640
and what song will you dance to for me to see.

163
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:25,700
Since Wang'ye has ordered it,

164
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:27,740
how can I not obey.

165
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:32,260
Who is it?

166
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:34,520
Your servant, Fang He.

167
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,400
What?

168
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,579
14th Prince ordered me to send medicine.

169
00:08:46,579 --> 00:08:49,120
The instructions are inside.

170
00:08:57,460 --> 00:09:00,000
Did 14th brother send it?

171
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,060
You have to leave?

172
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:07,940
After Crown Prince asked for you hand in marriage,

173
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:09,820
you have been distracted.

174
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:11,860
I thought you were getting better,

175
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:14,480
now, one word from Imperial Father

176
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,560
has caused you to be strange again.

177
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:19,060
I think

178
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:20,540
from now on,

179
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:22,420
there will be quite a few problems.

180
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,900
Will you face them looking like this?

181
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:30,640
The more your heart is afraid,

182
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,940
the more your face has to remain calm.

183
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,700
If others can't figure you out,

184
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:37,220
they won't easily make any moves.

185
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:41,020
Who would be like you

186
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:45,480
and wear their emotions on their sleeve?

187
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:48,820
I'll remember.

188
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:50,340
Then I'll leave.

189
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:58,380
I'll take this as evidence

190
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:02,060
to see if you've improved next time.

191
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:09,820
10th Prince! 10th Prince!

192
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:11,320
What?

193
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:12,820
Say it quickly.

194
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,016
When is Fu'jin coming back?

195
00:10:14,016 --> 00:10:15,100
Replying to 10th Prince,

196
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:16,420
10th Fujin wasn't willing to see me.

197
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:17,920
She told someone to tell me

198
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,340
that she will not return.

199
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:21,680
It was just a lantern!

200
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,340
Is it worth having such a big fight over?

201
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,160
10th Fujin said,

202
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:27,260
if 10th Prince wants her to return,

203
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:28,060
you will have to--

204
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:29,480
Have to do what? Say it fast!

205
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,100
You have to apologize to her.

206
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,260
What?

207
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:33,780
She wants me to apologize to her?

208
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:35,440
What a scandal!

209
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:38,000
Then do I have to kneel to her too?

210
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,480
If she doesn't want to come back, then don't come back!

211
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,900
I don't care!

212
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:44,080
I'll tell you,

213
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,300
I do like candied haw and hate hibiscus cake!

214
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:47,860
So what!

215
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:50,820
You! Return home

216
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:51,880
and tell her,

217
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:54,060
if she doesn't come back, I'll...

218
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:56,320
I'll ask for an edict to divorce the hibiscus cake!

219
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:58,100
Why aren't you gone yet?

220
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,700
No, I'm afraid I heard wrong,

221
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,860
did 10th Prince just say to divorce a hibiscus cake?

222
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:04,500
I... I said to divorce Fujin!

223
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,540
Why are you still standing here? Hurry and Go!

224
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,100
Yes.

225
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:10,860
How dare she?

226
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:14,560
I will go buy all the candied haws in the city.

227
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,420
I'll... I'll... I'll anger you to death!

228
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:22,760
How dare she?

229
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:26,760
He dares?! How dare him! Howdare him!

230
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,480
Having a tantrum here,

231
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,980
10th Prince can't see it.

232
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:33,800
If you want to be angry, be angry at home. It only works if 10th Prince sees it

233
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,180
I don't want to return!

234
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:37,100
He wants to bring me back and just sent a servant!

235
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,980
He doesn't have any sincerity.

236
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:40,820
If I return like this,

237
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:41,860
then in 10th Prince's estate,

238
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:43,960
how will I have control?

239
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:47,420
Your pacing is making me dizzy.

240
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:51,300
No matter what 10th Prince says, he's still a prince.

241
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:52,640
You have to give him some face.

242
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,500
He has to have face, but I can't?

243
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,240
He's the one not giving me face!

244
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,020
And made me hate the Lantern Festival,

245
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:00,080
which was originally my favorite holiday!

246
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:02,240
It was just a lantern,

247
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,640
what can it represent?

248
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,340
I see a lantern now,

249
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:06,180
but behind it

250
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:08,220
is a fire dragon!

251
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,660
Informing mistresses,

252
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:12,020
Tenth Prince's Xiao An Zi is here to pass a message along.

253
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:13,120
Let him come in.

254
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,400
Yes.

255
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:18,500
Since Tenth Prince sent someone to pass a message,

256
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,220
give him some face

257
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:22,620
and stop playing tricks.

258
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:27,460
Greetings, 8th Fujin.

259
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:28,620
Greetings, 10th Fujin.

260
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:30,040
Rise.

261
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,240
What did 10th Prince say?

262
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,340
10th Prince said...

263
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:35,940
if 10th Fujin doesn't return,

264
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:38,120
he will... will...

265
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:40,180
will divorce 10th Fujin.

266
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,220
What?!

267
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,800
Jie'jie,

268
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,840
you hear that?

269
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:49,780
Did he only say this?

270
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:51,700
Yes.

271
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:54,580
Then when you returned earlier with Mingyu's message,

272
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:56,120
what was 10th Prince's reaction?

273
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:57,940
He was a little upset

274
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:00,320
saying something about liking candied haws

275
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,540
and disliking hibiscus cakes.

276
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:05,380
What does that mean?

277
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:07,600
I don't know either.

278
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,960
What else can it mean?

279
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:13,480
At this point, he's thinking about eating candied haws

280
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:16,940
It obviously means he doesn't care about me!

281
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:18,740
Fine.

282
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:20,340
He doesn't care about me,

283
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:22,180
then I don't care about him!

284
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:25,640
You... You... You-you-you!

285
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,140
Return and tell him

286
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,640
if he wants to divorce me, then do it fast

287
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,340
so we won't despise each other.

288
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:31,280
Madam.

289
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,780
Greetings, 8th Fujin. Greetings 10th Fujin.

290
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:35,160
What is it?

291
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,440
His Majesty is asking to see both Fujins' father.

292
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,660
Once I heard, I hurried to inform you.

293
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:54,760
Greetings, 10th Fujin.

294
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:00,580
Greetings, 10th Prince.

295
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,440
Rise.

296
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:05,980
Ruoxi,

297
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:07,360
why did Imperial Father

298
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,220
ask to see Ming Shang e'fu?

299
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:12,560
Are you also here for this?

300
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,100
Do you even have to ask?

301
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:15,700
You dare to bully me

302
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:17,040
would my father not interfere?

303
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:18,760
Who is bullying who?

304
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,100
Everyone can see

305
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,320
Ruoxi, you say it

306
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,940
Was she the one bullying me or was I the one bullying her?

307
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:25,800
You two are on the same side

308
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,880
Do you even have to ask?

309
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:27,880
You want to divorce me

310
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:28,960
because of her!

311
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:30,600
If you return home,

312
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,780
why would I divorce you?

313
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:33,020
If you really wanted me to return home,

314
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:34,220
why didn't you personally get me?

315
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:35,860
You wanted me to personally get you?

316
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:37,060
You were already unreasonable in leaving,

317
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:38,240
I'm not arguing about it with you

318
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:38,760
You...

319
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,040
Don't bullying so much!

320
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,300
10th prince, 10th Fujin,

321
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:42,420
would you listen to me?

322
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:43,200
I don't want to hear it!

323
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,500
Ruoxi, you can say it

324
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,820
I don't want to hear it!

325
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:46,820
Ignore her, talk

326
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:47,840
You dare?!

327
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:48,900
Speak!

328
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:50,940
Stop arguing

329
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:52,400
10th prince

330
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,220
just now His Majesty asked to see Ming Shang e'fu,
(e'fu - princess's consort)

331
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:56,400
probably to talk about your relationship.

332
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,360
Since 10th Prince wants to divorce his wife,

333
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,940
then he can use this chance

334
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:00,980
to tell His Majesty

335
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:02,780
that the fate between you two is finished.

336
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:05,100
To be truthful,

337
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,340
I informed His Majesty

338
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:07,660
about your relationship.

339
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,060
Why?

340
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:09,740
You!

341
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:12,120
I see that you both argue day and night

342
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,020
how will you live on?

343
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:16,140
I feel bad just seeing it.

344
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,260
The only solution is

345
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:20,200
to let His Majesty decide.

346
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,500
His Majesty is wise

347
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,940
and he knows that a forced relationship will not be good.

348
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:27,200
So even if  you,10th Prince, wants to divorce your wife,

349
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,860
you won't be punished.

350
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:32,620
At worst, 10th Fujin will return to her home

351
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:34,260
and accompany her parents until she's old.

352
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:38,720
Or marry a Persian prince.

353
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:40,820
10th Prince can also marry another.

354
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:43,160
In the end, the result

355
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:45,300
will give both of you what you want.

356
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,560
This way, you two will not contact each other ever again.

357
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,220
Didn't I do a good deed?

358
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:51,260
You...

359
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,280
You two are together in this...

360
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:55,560
M-Ming...

361
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:01,740
Ruoxi, who told you to interfere?

362
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:02,900
Did I do wrong?

363
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:03,580
Wrong!

364
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:04,800
A huge wrong!

365
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:14,740
Greetings, 14th Prince

366
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:18,460
Why did you lie?

367
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,900
You were just serving tea,

368
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:22,380
how can you not know

369
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,540
Imperial Father asked to see Ming Shang e'fu

370
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:26,220
only to talk about politics.

371
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:29,200
Do you know that lying to princes

372
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,760
is a huge crime?

373
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:32,700
How can I not know?

374
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:34,420
But if I don't do this,

375
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:36,920
10th Prince will make a larger commotion,

376
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:39,600
making a mountain out of a molehill,

377
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,160
and divorce 10th Fujin.

378
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:44,460
So I could only do it this way.

379
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:46,800
I hope you can make 10th Brother and 10th Fujin

380
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:47,820
resolve their conflict.

381
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:49,680
I also wish it so.

382
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:52,260
Oh by the way, 14th Prince,

383
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:54,220
did you return the bangle

384
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:55,300
to 8th Prince?

385
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:57,300
Can I not say?

386
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:11,660
Mingyu!

387
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:13,720
Mingyu!

388
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,219
Don't be like this,

389
00:17:15,219 --> 00:17:16,320
let's talk about it.

390
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:17,140
What is there to talk about?

391
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:18,499
I will never to listen to you again.

392
00:17:18,639 --> 00:17:20,459
Why won't you listen to me?

393
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:22,100
Don't keep holding onto me1

394
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:23,819
You can go find your Ruoxi now,

395
00:17:23,995 --> 00:17:25,420
I won't bother you again.

396
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:27,000
Ever again!

397
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,940
Mingyu, I don't know anything.

398
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:30,599
I seriously don't know anything.

399
00:17:30,599 --> 00:17:31,380
I seriously don't know anything.

400
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:32,760
You're lying!

401
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:33,360
Master!

402
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:34,280
- Are you all right?
-  Master, are you all right?

403
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:35,080
Mingyu!

404
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,120
You.... listen to me!

405
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,600
Let go!

406
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:38,920
Mingyu!

407
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,400
This... you tell me...

408
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,640
You two idiots!

409
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,160
Mingyu!

410
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,780
What are you doing?

411
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,180
Do you want to move?

412
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:10,600
I am being expelled.

413
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,060
To keep hanging on won't do.

414
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:14,200
Who is expelling you?

415
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:20,100
Put it down.

416
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:23,940
Put it down!

417
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,440
What is that?

418
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:32,740
These are my belongings.

419
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:34,160
Let me see.

420
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,640
Look!

421
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:41,740
Seen enough?

422
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:45,020
This is mine.

423
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:46,380
This is mine.

424
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:47,820
This is when we were vacationing in Jiangnan.

425
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:49,200
I paid for it.

426
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,920
That was when you said you'd give it to me.

427
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:54,740
You also said when you're old

428
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:57,020
and deaf,

429
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:00,420
you'll let me twirl it.

430
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:07,940
Nevermind, I don't want it.

431
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,360
This is also mine.

432
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,440
I embroidered it myself.

433
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,780
It even has my blood on it.

434
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:16,820
Who did you embroider it for?

435
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,380
I never said I'd give it to you.

436
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:23,900
This fat duck--

437
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,600
Those are Mandarin ducks!

438
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:27,180
Fine, fine, fine.

439
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,060
Who do these Mandarin ducks represent?

440
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:34,420
You said it, so say it again

441
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:36,360
I forgot.

442
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,720
I don't want it.

443
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:49,340
This eyebrow pencil,

444
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:51,420
was bought by me and used by me.

445
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:53,540
It wouldn't be yours too, would it?

446
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:55,540
But,

447
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:57,100
you let me use it every day

448
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:58,720
to draw your eyebrows.

449
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:03,040
You tell me, is it mine or is it yours?

450
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,660
You want everything.

451
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:07,360
What don't you want?

452
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:16,860
This, I don't want.

453
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:18,500
I don't want this!

454
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,220
This stupid lantern

455
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:21,900
has caused so much chaos in my house!

456
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:24,200
It... Me... I...

457
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,160
I'll stomp it. I'll break it.

458
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,940
I'll break it! I'll stomp it!

459
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:29,720
Stop stomping!

460
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:33,920
All right.

461
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:38,100
Imperial Father already knows about us.

462
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:39,340
Maybe...

463
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:41,400
Maybe he's talking with my father

464
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:44,560
about our separation.

465
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:48,340
It's good now.

466
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:50,560
From now on,

467
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:54,080
we won't have to argue.

468
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,480
Don't move it anymore.

469
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,940
Take all the things off

470
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:20,140
and move them back.

471
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:21,920
All right, stop

472
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,220
Send it all back.

473
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:24,640
- Yes.
- Yes.

474
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,740
Mistress, you're not leaving?

475
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:31,540
From now on,

476
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,880
10th Prince won't argue with me,

477
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:39,300
so there is no meaning to not moving back.

478
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:57,900
Why are the crickets so noisy tonight?

479
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:02,780
So bothersome! So bothersome!

480
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:03,900
It's quiet.

481
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:05,140
Yes, there are no cricket sounds

482
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:07,240
That's right.

483
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:12,180
Tenth Prince, it's the same as usual.

484
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,200
Do your ears have issues?

485
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,200
It is obviously very loud.

486
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:19,980
You tell me, you can hear it!

487
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:21,220
Is it noisy?

488
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:23,200
Replying to 10th Prince, it's the same as it usually is.

489
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,520
Right.

490
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,260
How is that possible?

491
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:37,900
What is going on??

492
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,920
Is there a problem with my ears?

493
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:41,020
10th Prince,

494
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:42,540
there are no problems with your ears.

495
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:43,460
Normally,

496
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:44,680
when 10th Fujin is at home,

497
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,200
both Masters argue loudly every day.

498
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:49,020
Where is there time to listen to crickets?

499
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:50,360
I tried for 3 months,

500
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:51,360
not to eat hibiscus cakes.

501
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:53,020
I thought I would die.

502
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,180
Then I knew,

503
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:55,300
that my favorite food

504
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:56,700
was hibiscus cake.

505
00:22:57,780 --> 00:23:01,200
Right, I don't want to eat candied haws,

506
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,860
I want to eat hibiscus cake.

507
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:05,640
Right, I want to eat hibiscus cake!

508
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,500
I don't want to eat candied haws!

509
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:07,760
10th Prince!

510
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:11,740
Mistress, get in the sedan.

511
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,460
I don't want to eat candied haws!

512
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:16,980
10th prince!

513
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:17,540
I want to eat hibiscus cake!

514
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:18,820
10th Prince!

515
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:20,880
Mingyu, I understand now,

516
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:22,240
I don't want to eat candied haws,

517
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,380
I want to eat hibiscus cake!

518
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,140
What candied haw and hibiscus cake?

519
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:26,440
No!

520
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:27,440
I mean...

521
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:29,680
I mean, I like you.

522
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,440
Don't leave.

523
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:34,080
Don't leave!

524
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:41,160
But you said you'll divorce me.

525
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,520
I was angry.

526
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:44,300
After ordering the servant to tell you,

527
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:45,800
I regretted it.

528
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:47,280
Mingyu.

529
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,480
The two of us together,

530
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,660
haven't we been happy?

531
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:53,380
Mingyu!

532
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:54,920
How about...

533
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,840
how about I kneel for you?

534
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:58,360
Are you insane?

535
00:23:58,360 --> 00:23:59,400
You are a Prince.

536
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:00,900
How can you kneel for just anyone?

537
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:02,220
No sense of strong will.

538
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:04,520
People will make fun of you.

539
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:06,640
So what if people make fun of me?

540
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:15,560
MIngyu.

541
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:17,960
Someone doesn't want to let go of my hands.

542
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,220
Someone doesn't want to let go of my hands.

543
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:22,480
You are not afraid of being made fun of?

544
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,040
But I am.

545
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:25,500
You being like this,

546
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,880
how am I supposed to be with you in the future?

547
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:30,360
Then,

548
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:32,540
you agree to stay with me?

549
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:35,220
I really don't know,

550
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:37,040
what "evil" I did in my previous life,

551
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:39,360
to meet you as my "destined lover" in this life.

552
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:40,220
Right!

553
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:41,520
We are "foes"!

554
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:42,680
Lets go back.

555
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:44,480
Come.

556
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:47,320
Don't get happy too early.

557
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:48,740
What now?

558
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:50,280
I am not the problem.

559
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:52,100
We don't know what Imperial Father

560
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:54,520
is thinking in regards to us.

561
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:57,660
Don't be afraid.

562
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,340
Mingyu,

563
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:02,500
as long as our hearts

564
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:04,120
are together

565
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:07,020
no one can separate us.

566
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:25,700
Mingyu, don't worry,

567
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,040
as long as, in front of the Imperial Father we show

568
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,920
that we are in love

569
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,020
and respect each other,

570
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:31,320
Imperial Father

571
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:33,040
won't separate us.

572
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,620
But...

573
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:36,840
But if it's already been decided that

574
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:37,780
Imperial Father is forcing me to marry

575
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:39,400
that Persian Prince,

576
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,440
then what are we going to do?

577
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,900
If it is like this...

578
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:45,580
if it is like this,

579
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:46,900
I don't want to live anymore.

580
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:48,900
I'll elope with you!

581
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:50,940
Really?

582
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:52,480
Yes.

583
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,280
Mingyu,

584
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:56,940
are you afraid of dying?

585
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:02,600
If I am with you,

586
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:03,960
even if we go to the land of the dead together,

587
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:05,880
I will be happy.

588
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:23,020
Are you ready?

589
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,960
10th Brother, 10th Sister-in-law,

590
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,020
are you going to see Imperial Father?

591
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:51,220
How did you know?

592
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:54,020
It must be those servants!

593
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:56,680
They wanted to share their master's troubles.

594
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:57,960
However,

595
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,880
you don't need to go anymore.

596
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:01,180
But you can still make it...

597
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:02,140
otherwise, Ruoxi

598
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:04,080
will definitely get punished by Imperial Father.

599
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:07,380
What do you mean?

600
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:08,800
Actually, Imperial Father

601
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:09,620
doesn't know a thing

602
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:11,840
about the fight between you two.

603
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:12,840
But Ruoxi

604
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,060
clearly told me

605
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:15,500
she already told Imperial Father

606
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:16,780
about our fight.

607
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:17,640
That's right,

608
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,460
didn't Imperial Father already look for my father

609
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:20,860
to discuss

610
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:23,000
us breaking up?

611
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:25,660
Ruoxi made it all up.

612
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:27,860
Should I believe you

613
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:30,060
or Ruoxi?

614
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:33,620
Let's believe 14th Brother.

615
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:37,940
Oh, no wonder you said

616
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:39,280
Ruoxi is going to be punished.

617
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:39,860
But why did she

618
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:41,520
say such things?

619
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:43,940
Almost ruined us as a couple.

620
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:45,280
Causing us to be separated.

621
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:46,480
That is because--

622
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:48,500
However, she thinks is fine.

623
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,620
Since we don't have to see Imperial Father anymore,

624
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:54,780
let's go home.

625
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,720
10th Brother, 10th Sister-in-law,

626
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,940
I have never seen

627
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:05,180
you holding each other's hands

628
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,200
this tightly before.

629
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:14,460
Wait for me downstairs.

630
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:15,920
Make it fast.

631
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:21,520
14th Prince,

632
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:24,140
may I trouble you to convey a message to Ruoxi.

633
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:25,180
Of course.

634
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:28,100
I know what she did

635
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:29,340
was to use a shock tactic

636
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:31,720
to make me reconcile with 10th Prince.

637
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:32,660
But she mustn't expect me to thank

638
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:34,360
her for that.

639
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:35,660
Because happiness

640
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:37,640
needs one's own effort to get it.

641
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:39,880
I am sure, she knows that herself.

642
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:41,740
She knows.

643
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:50,100
Let's go!

644
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:57,640
8th Brother,

645
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:59,600
only Ruoxi herself knows

646
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:01,260
what her happiness is.

647
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:25,080
She has chosen to be with 4th Prince.

648
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:33,240
10th Prince,

649
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:55,280
let's go.

650
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:57,880
This flower's fragrance is really good.

651
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,720
Because it's me who picked it.

652
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:00,680
10th Prince, 10th Sister-in-law.

653
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:02,280
14th Brother.

654
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:04,920
Greetings, 14th Prince.

655
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:06,340
Rise.

656
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:08,740
10th Brother and 10th Sister-in-law are really teasing together.

657
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:10,240
Both suddenly changed.

658
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,080
Before, with only a short conversation

659
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:12,400
and they'd already get into a fight.

660
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:13,440
Now when they see each other,

661
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,340
they go to great lengths to dote on each other.

662
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:16,940
Not like the way they were in their first year of marriage.

663
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:18,140
They seem like a couple

664
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:19,740
of young newlyweds.

665
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:21,520
Really can't imagine

666
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:22,960
that such a hot-headed person

667
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:25,420
would one day change into a compliant person.

668
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,400
Ruoxi, by the way

669
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,680
I already give the bracelet

670
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:35,040
to 8th Brother at his manor.

671
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:38,300
8th brother accepted the bracelet with a smile.

672
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,820
He took the ink stone on his desk

673
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:42,780
and broke the bracelet into pieces.

674
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:45,240
8th Brother laughed and said,

675
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,580
"In the end,

676
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:48,520
she still chose 4th Brother."

677
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:51,860
Ruoxi, is that true?

678
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,060
You didn't ask him

679
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:57,440
why he said that?

680
00:32:57,540 --> 00:32:58,960
8th Brother said,

681
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,780
since you entered the palace,

682
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:03,400
you treat 4th Brother different from us others.

683
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:05,560
When serving tea,

684
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:07,920
it is firstly according to his preferences.

685
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:08,680
Then gradually

686
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:10,740
to suit the taste of each other,

687
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:12,200
in a lot of things,

688
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:14,100
you tried your best to protect him.

689
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,440
You even splashed tea on 10th Brother.

690
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:19,620
During year 47, when the Crown Prince was deposed,

691
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:21,480
when you returned from Saiwai

692
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:22,940
the expression in your eyes when you saw 4th Brother

693
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:24,340
became more and more different.

694
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:28,020
Sometimes your face would flush.

695
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:30,420
Later, even without 8th Brother pointing it out to me,

696
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:31,340
I noticed many times

697
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:33,340
you and 4th Brother would flirt together.

698
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:35,200
You sometimes smiled,

699
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:37,060
sometimes you showed a little annoyance.

700
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:37,900
but 8th Brother constantly paid attention to

701
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:39,240
your every action.

702
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:41,640
Normally, he would notice much more.

703
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:43,540
I really didn't know,

704
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:46,820
that this is what he thought from start to end.

705
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:48,920
That is because he never showed

706
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,800
his real thoughts.

707
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:54,440
He never really trusted me.

708
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:55,920
Ruoxi.

709
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:57,540
Do you really love 4th Brother?

710
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:03,840
Yes.

711
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:05,560
I love 4th Prince.

712
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:07,800
I have always liked 4th Prince

713
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:10,140
and love him deeply.

714
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:12,840
Satisfied?

715
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,280
What's wong

716
00:34:25,519 --> 00:34:27,120
there is a tiger chasing you?

717
00:34:38,579 --> 00:34:40,080
What's wrong?

718
00:34:53,180 --> 00:34:54,959
From now on,

719
00:34:55,059 --> 00:34:57,420
you're not going to lie to me anymore?

720
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:59,786
You'll tell me everything?

721
00:35:00,619 --> 00:35:02,080
Yes.

722
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:06,820
I am fine.

723
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:11,980
Want to know why?

724
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:16,740
There is something.

725
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,460
I don't want to say it now,

726
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:22,620
can I not?

727
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:26,160
Yes.

728
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,006
Imperial Father is still waiting for me

729
00:35:31,006 --> 00:35:32,680
and Thirteenth Brother.

730
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:34,761
I'm leaving now.

731
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:44,854
In the Forbidden City

732
00:35:44,854 --> 00:35:47,120
I am not alone.

733
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:51,080
4th prince is willing to listen to my fears, worries, and troubles.

734
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:53,680
He always reminds me of unforeseen dangers.

735
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:56,620
He opens himself to me.

736
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:58,429
I don't know how it will be in the future,

737
00:35:58,529 --> 00:35:59,915
but at least for now

738
00:36:00,015 --> 00:36:02,794
it's a good beginning.

739
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:25,860
Weren't you always avoiding me?

740
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:28,420
How come you suddenly want to see me?

741
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:30,457
I've thought for a long time.

742
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:32,853
There are some things,

743
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:36,700
I still have to talk to you about.

744
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:41,140
I am not an ideal person,

745
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:44,220
but I always expect 8th Prince to be perfect.

746
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:46,860
If my arrogance is tamed,

747
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:48,900
my passion dies.

748
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:51,842
If I was more resigned to fate,

749
00:36:51,842 --> 00:36:53,700
had more tolerance,

750
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:55,880
was more forgiving,

751
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:58,380
and had less prejudice,

752
00:36:58,831 --> 00:37:00,596
perhaps me and 8th Prince

753
00:37:00,596 --> 00:37:03,180
would have had a different ending.

754
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:08,720
You may think that I'm being truthful or...

755
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,636
I'm faking this.

756
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,794
But all this is over now.

757
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:16,461
Everything is like that jade bangle,

758
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:19,480
regardless of its past glory

759
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:21,588
and beauty,

760
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:24,414
it has already become dust.

761
00:37:26,951 --> 00:37:28,594
I'm really happy

762
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:31,980
that you can speak frankly with me.

763
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:34,861
I am only passing through your life.

764
00:37:35,705 --> 00:37:38,073
I don't ask to be forgiven,

765
00:37:38,328 --> 00:37:40,915
only want to wish to 8th prince

766
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:43,908
will take good care of yourself.

767
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,494
You have care too.

768
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:02,913
Li Dequan.

769
00:38:02,913 --> 00:38:03,600
Your Majesty.

770
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:06,680
How long since Ruoxi bothered to make something?

771
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:07,618
Half a year.

772
00:38:07,618 --> 00:38:08,450
This year,

773
00:38:08,450 --> 00:38:11,765
I want to see what kinds of new things she's thought of.

774
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:24,606
It has a clear and shiny color.

775
00:38:24,606 --> 00:38:26,201
The taste is not too sweet.

776
00:38:26,301 --> 00:38:27,919
It melts in the mouth.

777
00:38:28,019 --> 00:38:31,000
It even exudes the light fragrance of the lotus.

778
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,400
Not bad.

779
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:34,620
Thank you for your praise, Your Majesty.

780
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:35,953
Let them taste it too.

781
00:38:36,053 --> 00:38:37,171
Yes.

782
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,710
How's the taste?

783
00:38:57,810 --> 00:38:59,440
Exactly like what you said, Imperial Father.

784
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:00,760
Yes, tastes good.

785
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:01,795
It melts in my mouth and...

786
00:39:01,795 --> 00:39:03,160
leaves a nice taste.

787
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:04,317
4th Prince,

788
00:39:04,317 --> 00:39:05,818
what do you think?

789
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:14,500
I think it's very good.

790
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:15,706
I'm still savoring the taste.

791
00:39:15,806 --> 00:39:18,663
That's why I cannot answer you just now.

792
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,380
Bring one more.

793
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:49,240
Where's 4th Prince?

794
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:51,313
He went to change his clothes.

795
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:57,650
What makes you so overjoyed, Rouxi?

796
00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:00,560
In 4th Prince's dessert

797
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:02,819
I added something that the others didn't have.

798
00:40:02,919 --> 00:40:04,291
What?

799
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:06,040
Salt.

800
00:40:06,263 --> 00:40:07,534
Salt?

801
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:10,639
I was just thinking,

802
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:12,337
no wonder 4th Brother was swallowing the tea

803
00:40:12,337 --> 00:40:14,252
and not sipping the tea.

804
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:15,438
By the gods,

805
00:40:15,713 --> 00:40:16,983
you are really bold to...

806
00:40:17,083 --> 00:40:18,337
even dare to make fun of 4th Brother,

807
00:40:18,477 --> 00:40:20,280
also right in front of Imperial Father.

808
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:21,574
Who asked him to tease me all the time?

809
00:40:21,574 --> 00:40:22,576
And also,

810
00:40:22,576 --> 00:40:23,847
if I don't do it in front of His Majesty,

811
00:40:23,847 --> 00:40:25,762
how could I succeed?

812
00:40:28,113 --> 00:40:29,491
He's here!

813
00:40:30,017 --> 00:40:30,988
I'm going.

814
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:32,980
Had the courage to do it,

815
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:34,166
so don't run away.

816
00:40:34,266 --> 00:40:35,486
He must still be angry about it.

817
00:40:35,486 --> 00:40:36,979
Let me hide first.

818
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:38,346
Go.

819
00:40:38,446 --> 00:40:39,924
Come back here!

820
00:40:57,540 --> 00:40:59,240
Want to fight or punish as you want,

821
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:01,149
but don't keep me in suspense.

822
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:03,321
Hand.

823
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:18,782
You are not afraid of me now?

824
00:41:19,708 --> 00:41:22,108
Since when am I afraid of you?

825
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:25,509
Before,

826
00:41:25,509 --> 00:41:28,360
I had been scared a little bit

827
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:29,935
Only a little bit.

828
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:32,150
A little bit more.

829
00:41:32,150 --> 00:41:34,561
Only a little bit more.

830
00:41:35,444 --> 00:41:36,526
Seems that I have to make you

831
00:41:36,526 --> 00:41:38,548
fear me a bit more.

832
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:46,869
Are you really mad?

833
00:41:48,152 --> 00:41:49,981
You ignore me?

834
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:53,314
In the future, I won't make fun of you.

835
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:56,134
I am not angry.

836
00:41:56,534 --> 00:41:58,410
Then why don't you speak?

837
00:41:59,181 --> 00:42:00,524
I'm thirsty.

838
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:13,924
It makes a long time that I haven't see JieJie

839
00:42:13,924 --> 00:42:15,560
for so long.

840
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:16,914
Is that so?

841
00:42:17,014 --> 00:42:19,122
There is even laughter in your eyes.

842
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:26,360
When was last time I smiled...

843
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:28,778
like this?

844
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:33,481
Kneel down, servant!

845
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:36,626
Crown Prince.

846
00:42:36,726 --> 00:42:38,098
You... what you want is the tribute wine.

847
00:42:38,098 --> 00:42:40,295
I got all that I could get

848
00:42:40,395 --> 00:42:41,806
So what if it is tribute wine?

849
00:42:41,906 --> 00:42:42,603
Even me, a Crown Prince,

850
00:42:42,603 --> 00:42:44,160
cannot drink it?

851
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:45,200
Take him away.

852
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:46,400
Whip him harshly!

853
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:47,520
Yes.

854
00:42:47,620 --> 00:42:49,280
- C-Crown Prince!
- Go!

855
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:49,871
You don't listen to me!

856
00:42:49,871 --> 00:42:51,307
I'll beat you until you listen to me!

857
00:42:51,307 --> 00:42:54,557
If you don't obey me, I will beat you until you obey me!

858
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:01,886
What is going on?

859
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:03,965
The Crown Prince is having a banquet today.

860
00:43:03,965 --> 00:43:05,640
He thinks that the wine given to him isn't quite enough.

861
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:08,075
So he took his anger out on the servants.

862
00:43:08,075 --> 00:43:09,600
Is it always like this?

863
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:11,063
The rumors of removing the Crown Prince are spreading fast...

864
00:43:11,063 --> 00:43:12,146
and furious throughout the palace.

865
00:43:12,464 --> 00:43:14,320
The Crown Prince has become more agitated.

866
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:15,560
He always vents his frustration...

867
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:18,360
on us, servants.

868
00:43:18,460 --> 00:43:19,620
Let him be.

869
00:43:19,620 --> 00:43:21,698
His life isn't going well.

870
00:43:21,798 --> 00:43:22,913
"He" is the Crown Prince!

871
00:43:22,913 --> 00:43:25,095
How can he not be doing well?

872
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:27,680
Jie Jie.

873
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:28,530
Could it be...

874
00:43:28,530 --> 00:43:30,460
like the rumours...

875
00:43:30,460 --> 00:43:32,247
that His Majesty will depose the Crown Prince again?

876
00:43:32,247 --> 00:43:33,833
We, who are servants,

877
00:43:33,933 --> 00:43:35,694
have things that we cannot freely tell others.

878
00:43:36,241 --> 00:43:38,045
Jie Jie's reminder is correct.

879
00:43:38,145 --> 00:43:39,020
Oh, Jie Jie,

880
00:43:39,020 --> 00:43:40,856
where are you going?

881
00:43:41,674 --> 00:43:43,168
Its the Mid-Autumn Festival,

882
00:43:43,168 --> 00:43:45,111
I'm going to go enjoy the moon.

883
00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:21,782
Good in horse-back archery,

884
00:44:21,882 --> 00:44:23,424
he hit every target.

885
00:44:23,424 --> 00:44:25,135
He rides the horse swiftly.

886
00:44:25,235 --> 00:44:26,117
His writing is...

887
00:44:26,117 --> 00:44:28,303
neat and refreshing.

888
00:44:28,672 --> 00:44:30,007
His music is...

889
00:44:30,007 --> 00:44:32,379
just as fine too.

890
00:44:33,037 --> 00:44:34,909
He is someone who is good in everything.

891
00:44:34,909 --> 00:44:37,234
He's also a carefree person.

892
00:44:37,542 --> 00:44:38,963
How can someone like him...

893
00:44:38,963 --> 00:44:41,674
live 10 years in solitary?

894
00:44:48,501 --> 00:44:50,050
Why don't you continue?

895
00:44:50,150 --> 00:44:51,582
Did I disturb you?

896
00:44:51,682 --> 00:44:52,843
Just felt like someone was secretly listening,

897
00:44:52,843 --> 00:44:55,408
I didn't know it was you, that's why I stopped.

898
00:44:56,380 --> 00:44:57,968
Why didn't you stay by His Majesty's side,

899
00:44:58,068 --> 00:44:59,729
instead of drinking wine all alone.

900
00:45:00,158 --> 00:45:01,451
If you can enjoy this great place,

901
00:45:01,551 --> 00:45:03,326
why can't I?

902
00:45:13,740 --> 00:45:15,851
We haven't drunk together in such a long time.

903
00:45:16,490 --> 00:45:17,784
Yes.

904
00:45:17,784 --> 00:45:19,420
8 years.

905
00:45:20,780 --> 00:45:22,145
Since we met here...

906
00:45:22,145 --> 00:45:23,362
and have some wine,

907
00:45:23,362 --> 00:45:24,951
let's have a good drink together.

908
00:45:25,166 --> 00:45:26,048
Next time, we drink together

909
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:29,756
it could be in another 8 years.

910
00:45:30,762 --> 00:45:32,398
8 years.

911
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:37,306
Yes, we should have a good drink.

912
00:45:43,533 --> 00:45:45,265
If you weren't born as Royalty,

913
00:45:45,365 --> 00:45:47,320
that would have been great.

914
00:45:47,420 --> 00:45:49,470
I, myself, have thought

915
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:51,742
I want there to be a day

916
00:45:51,985 --> 00:45:53,471
I could ride a horse,

917
00:45:53,471 --> 00:45:54,382
bring my flute

918
00:45:54,382 --> 00:45:55,710
and sword,

919
00:45:55,746 --> 00:45:58,280
so I could roam the world freely.

920
00:45:58,280 --> 00:45:59,926
Hunt in the north and

921
00:45:59,926 --> 00:46:01,389
enjoy the music of Jiangnan.

922
00:46:01,389 --> 00:46:02,085
When I felt like it,

923
00:46:02,085 --> 00:46:04,400
I could have a feast and drink under the sky.

924
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:05,436
When I want to feel more refined,

925
00:46:05,436 --> 00:46:06,722
I could light the lantern and

926
00:46:06,722 --> 00:46:08,583
recite poems by its light.

927
00:46:10,780 --> 00:46:12,304
But...

928
00:46:12,349 --> 00:46:14,835
I'm already born into Royalty.

929
00:46:14,996 --> 00:46:17,264
Even if I could escape,

930
00:46:17,364 --> 00:46:18,261
I will still be

931
00:46:18,261 --> 00:46:20,090
thinking of my favorite brother.

932
00:46:20,580 --> 00:46:21,704
I don't want to leave him alone

933
00:46:21,704 --> 00:46:23,919
to face all the danger.

934
00:46:24,237 --> 00:46:26,181
He may have his mother

935
00:46:26,281 --> 00:46:28,534
and a same-blood brother...

936
00:46:29,140 --> 00:46:31,337
but it's as good as having none.

937
00:46:37,580 --> 00:46:39,001
What?

938
00:46:46,018 --> 00:46:47,753
Drank a little too much.

939
00:46:47,768 --> 00:46:49,729
The wine has become tears.

940
00:46:56,310 --> 00:47:00,930
♫  Stopping here, afraid to go any further ♫

941
00:47:02,230 --> 00:47:06,700
♫ so sorrow will be unable to make an appearance  ♫

942
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:14,090
♫  On the next page, the farewell penned by you,  ♫

943
00:47:14,890 --> 00:47:19,090
♫  it was not up to me to refuse  ♫

944
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:26,440
♫  We’ve walked down this path too hastily  ♫

945
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:33,930
♫  Embracing desires that weren’t realistic  ♫

946
00:47:34,620 --> 00:47:40,590
♫  Not in time, wasn’t able to wait long enough to look back and admire  ♫

947
00:47:41,180 --> 00:47:45,710
♫  The fragrance of magnolia is unable to hide wounds  ♫

948
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:52,420
♫  No longer looking for the sun’s rays peeking through the clouds ♫

949
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:58,620
♫  No longer looking for the paradise that we promised each other  ♫

950
00:47:59,230 --> 00:48:05,490
♫  No longer sighing, you once said that life is unpredictable  ♫

951
00:48:06,020 --> 00:48:13,080
♫  The three inches of sunlight that I was unable to borrow  ♫

952
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:21,810
♫  No longer looking for the sunlight peeking through the clouds  ♫

953
00:48:22,230 --> 00:48:28,000
♫  No longer looking for the paradise that we promised each other  ♫

954
00:48:28,550 --> 00:48:34,510
♫  No longer sighing, you once said that life is unpredictable  ♫

955
00:48:35,020 --> 00:48:40,840
♫  The three inches of sunlight that I was unable to borrow  ♫

956
00:48:41,530 --> 00:48:49,860
♫  That paradise is the place where I’d loved you  ♫
