00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:20,740
♫  In the blink of an eye, a thought of stubborn persistence  ♫

3
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:24,510
♫  We were destined to seek our doom like moths flying towards the flame  ♫

4
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:32,020
♫  Knowing that it’d be a disaster, why am I still at a loss about what to do  ♫

5
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:39,130
♫  The best is not to see, the best is not to miss you  ♫

6
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:44,300
♫  Only like this can I not be in love with you  ♫

7
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:48,800
♫  Just another brushing of the shoulder, and from then...♫

8
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:55,400
♫  I’ll keep falling deeper and deeper in love with you  ♫

9
00:00:55,420 --> 00:01:02,410
♫  It’s the mistake of time, forcing us to pass each other by  ♫

10
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:05,640
♫  How I miss you, how far you are  ♫

11
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:12,240
♫  Even though I’d known it’d only result in pain, at this moment, I still don’t want to escape  ♫

12
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:16,900
♫  Pity these words are too glaring they hurt the eyes  ♫

13
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:22,600
♫  Two worlds later ♫

14
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:25,430
♫  Don’t want to escape  ♫

15
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:30,470
♫  It’s the mistake of time, we can only pass each other by  ♫

16
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:35,200
♫  The magnitude of me missing you is as much as how far you are   ♫

17
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:41,900
♫  Even though I know the ending is a mistake that I cannot oppose  ♫

18
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:47,100
♫  Staying in this moment  ♫

19
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:55,470
♫  We can only accept that the feelings run deep, but fate is shallow  ♫

00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:02,000
Episode 2

21
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,660
1. Return home.

22
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:08,500
2. Die.

23
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,620
3. Disabled

24
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:12,420
Worth it!

25
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,320
Are you okay, Miss?

26
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,700
Who asked you to stop the horse?!

27
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,860
Why is it you again?

28
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,340
Fourth Prince.

29
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:33,140
You weren't running around randomly at all.

30
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:35,620
You saw our horses and ran over on purpose.

31
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:37,820
You are seeking to die.

32
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:38,900
I....

33
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:41,700
Why would i seek death ?

34
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,460
You have misunderstood.

35
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:45,380
That was just an accident.

36
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:47,460
The first time was an accident,

37
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:49,380
but this time it wasn't.

38
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:52,340
If you still want to die the next time,

39
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:53,660
I won't pull the reins anymore.

40
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:55,860
I want to live that why i did that.

41
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,780
There are too many things I cannot let go of.

42
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:03,460
Why would I want to die?

43
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:06,540
What you're saying is really strange.

44
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:10,540
Medicine for your injuries

45
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,620
Fourth Prince,

46
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,380
thank you!

47
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:23,100
I saved your life.

48
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:24,780
In the future, without my permission

49
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:27,340
don't even think about killing yourself.

50
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,060
Slow down, Second Miss.

51
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:03,540
- Second Miss.
- Ruoxi.

52
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:03,940
Second miss

53
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:05,180
You leg has not fully recovered.

54
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:06,260
Why are you not resting it?

55
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:08,320
You're even walking around.

56
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,460
I'm fine.

57
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:11,100
I already applied ointment the last time,

58
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:12,260
it's already much better.

59
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:15,660
We really should thank the 4th and 13th princes.

60
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:18,540
We should go and visit them

61
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:19,780
and thank them.

62
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,820
I've already thanked them the last time.

63
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:24,340
Don't bother doing it again.

64
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:25,980
This is basic etiquette.

65
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,660
Just for such a small thing,

66
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,060
I guess the two princes

67
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:32,580
would not take it to heart.

68
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,460
But if Difujin were to find out,

69
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:38,300
I'm afraid she'd make a mountain out of a molehill.

70
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:40,180
You certainly know how to worm your way out of things.

71
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:42,780
Is that how you use your intelligence?

72
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,540
Jiejie, this letter is addressed to you.

73
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:48,860
Why aren't you reading it?

74
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:51,580
The eunuch in charge of reading letters is not here today.

75
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:53,100
Let's leave it first.

76
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,180
For a simple job like reading letters,

77
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:57,260
let me do it for you.

78
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:58,620
You know how to read letters?

79
00:04:58,620 --> 00:04:59,780
What's so difficult about that?

80
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:01,060
It's a piece of cake.

81
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,180
Okay.

82
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:05,180
Since it's a letter from Father and Eldest Brother,

83
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:06,540
I will let you read it.

84
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:28,900
These words are for Ruolan to read.

85
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:32,500
"To the person reading this, it has been a long time since we've written to each other.

86
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:35,660
We have missed you a lot.

87
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:40,860
Reading your letters is almost as good as seeing you in person.

88
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:46,860
Greetings. What word is this?

89
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:49,980
Words after not having met for a long time.

90
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:53,580
Something win something... ?

91
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:55,980
Something, something.

92
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:59,300
Something, horse god*!"
(*Horse god is a homonym of something and is a modern slang for "what the heck is this!?")

93
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:01,260
There's even a horse god?

94
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,180
No.

95
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:06,140
Sister...

96
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:11,860
I have not seen you for a long time

97
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:14,540
I thought you will have become wiser

98
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,980
Able to read letter , read books

99
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:20,420
Turns out, your capability is nothing more than this.

100
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:25,180
Jiejie, I think this letter...

101
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:25,880
It is better for you to wait

102
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:28,060
for the eunuch to come and

103
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:29,580
read for you.

104
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:30,980
Have you given up?

105
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:31,940
No!

106
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,940
I think I had better

107
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:38,660
start studying from the beginning.

108
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,020
Then, I'll head back first.

109
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:54,340
"The falling leaves herald the leaving of winter.

110
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:58,620
The autumn winds over the lake stir up thoughts of homesickness in travellers.

111
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:02,460
There must be children catching grasshoppers,

112
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:07,380
seeing a brightly lit lamp near the fences late at night."

113
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,700
To think that I as a modern person,

114
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:16,660
studied hard persevered through 16 years of modern education,

115
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:18,740
and can be considered as an educated person.

116
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:19,680
But once here,

117
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,860
I'm considered half-illiterate.

118
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:25,900
Luckily. I came into this young lady's body.

119
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:27,500
I don't have to worry about starving or freezing.

120
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:29,380
Otherwise,

121
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:31,180
wouldn't I,

122
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:33,860
who can't do menial labour,

123
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:35,700
starve to death?

124
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:57,740
Little ants, don't run, don't run!

125
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:00,820
Come, let me play with you.

126
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:09,060
Greetings to Eighth Prince. Greetings to Tenth Prince.

127
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:10,300
Rise.

128
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:11,940
Looking at you crazy girl just now,

129
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:13,700
I thought there was something fun to play with.

130
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:16,540
It looks like I overestimated her.

131
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:18,740
To be esteemed by you isn't really an honor.

132
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:22,220
Reading Song poems?

133
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:23,820
Yes.

134
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:25,340
She was playing with ants!

135
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:28,740
It's just, she was putting on an act of being studious.

136
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:29,380
This rascal,

137
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:31,380
pretending to be some big shot in front of me?

138
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:32,740
Haven't you heard,

139
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:35,899
“To see a world in a grain of sand, and heaven in a wild flower”?

140
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:38,100
I'm looking at ants,

141
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,860
but I'm not looking at ants either.

142
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:44,180
Tenth Brother, you need to study hard.

143
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:47,140
A fool is a fool.

144
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:48,640
Just one sentence and you become mute.

145
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,420
Can't argue.

146
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,460
You read Buddhist scriptures?

147
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:55,780
I hear Jiejie chant them often, so I know a little.

148
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,220
It's true that she chants them often.

149
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:03,220
She only asks for her heart to be at peace.

150
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:07,140
There are overtones in Eighth Prince's words.

151
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:08,620
His true feelings are hidden.

152
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,980
If you were a boss,

153
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:13,140
you would be a boss among bosses.

154
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:18,540
You recognize all these words?

155
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:20,580
Yes,

156
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,740
I recognize them,

157
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:24,940
but they don't recognize me,

158
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:27,860
but we are getting to know each other.

159
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,820
Eight Brother, listen to what she's saying.

160
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:34,940
How will you let yourself know them better?

161
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:35,780
Through guessing.

162
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:38,220
That works too?

163
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:40,060
If that's the case, then none of us need to hire teachers,

164
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:41,900
we can just guess, can't we?

165
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,460
Let's leave.

166
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:50,620
We're going horseback riding. Do you want to come?

167
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:51,320
Horseback riding?

168
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,780
Yeah.

169
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:55,860
Okay.

170
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:57,220
Let's go.

171
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:59,300
Lucky!

172
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:17,780
Eh?

173
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,620
What did you just see?

174
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:29,700
I'm not telling you what I saw.

175
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:34,660
What did you just "Eh?" at?

176
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:37,420
If you want to know,

177
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:40,020
But you need to give me some benefits.

178
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:41,820
Aren't you a little too materialistic?

179
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43,500
I was only asking you,

180
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,740
and you want benefits?

181
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:46,260
You can't it say it like that.

182
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:48,140
I was the one who saw something interesting.

183
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:49,220
Since you want to know,

184
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:50,700
of course you have to give me some benefits.

185
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,480
Unless, when you're listening to storytellers tell stories,

186
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,860
you don't pay money.

187
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,260
For you.

188
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:03,380
Now can you tell me?

189
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,380
What? You think it's too little?

190
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:08,740
I'm not as materialistic as you.

191
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:09,840
You're not materialistic?

192
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,860
If what you're doing isn't considered materialistic, what is it?

193
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,980
I can't think of what I want at the moment.

194
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:16,980
How about this?

195
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:19,660
In the future, you need to agree to one of my requests.

196
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:21,940
It definitely won't be something you can't do.

197
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:24,300
Besides, you, as a prince,

198
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,940
agreeing to a little favour of a little girl,

199
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:27,420
what's so hard about that?

200
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,620
Yes. Okay then.

201
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:32,420
I promise you then. Say it.

202
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:33,660
Then you'd better remember it well.

203
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:34,940
I have a witness.

204
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:40,380
I'll remember. You can say it.

205
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,180
There are so many people on the street,

206
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:46,700
but our carriage is able to travel ahead without any hinderances.

207
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:49,180
Everyone who sees it makes way from afar.

208
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:52,420
But we have no sign that declares that Eighth Prince is in the carriage.

209
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:54,980
I was wondering why that happened.

210
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:56,180
So I made an 'Eh'.

211
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,460
Then why did you shake your head?

212
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:00,140
After that I thought about it.

213
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:01,220
This type of carriage

214
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,700
is definitely not one an ordinary person can ride in.

215
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,460
And we're in the capital (at the feet of the emperor).

216
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:06,860
These peasants have experience.

217
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:08,980
Even though they don't know who's in the carriage,

218
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:11,180
they know that they won't go wrong by making way.

219
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:12,940
As to shaking my head,

220
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,000
I only felt

221
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,780
that I became a fox*.
(*Chinese idiom where a fox swaggers around in the borrowed authority of a tiger)

222
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:19,340
Fox?

223
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:21,300
What does this have to do with being a fox?

224
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:25,060
"Fox borrowing Tiger's fierceness"
(Chinese idiom)

225
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:29,020
I understand. Fox borrowing the tiger's fierceness.

226
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:31,620
Just this?

227
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:33,180
Just this and you swindled a favor

228
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:35,780
out of a prince of the great Qing empire?

229
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,180
I'll let you guess what I'm thinking about too.

230
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:42,420
Wait.

231
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:56,580
No. This one's too old.

232
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:58,580
Come.

233
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,460
This one is too young.

234
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:02,740
His personality isn't set yet.

235
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:05,100
How did you go about finding these horses? Where's the horse?

236
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:07,500
Take Linglong here.

237
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:08,740
Yes.

238
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:10,040
That horse is gentle.

239
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,700
You can ride safely.

240
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:16,260
Ruoxi, you're so lucky.

241
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:18,780
Eighth Brother actually let you ride Linglong.

242
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,620
Wait for me.

243
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:33,660
So handsome.

244
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,020
Ruoxi. Ruoxi!

245
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:39,620
Why are you daydreaming? Hurry and get on the horse.

246
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,780
Why are you dilly-dallying?

247
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:46,380
Are you riding or not?

248
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:47,400
Go ride your own horse.

249
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,900
Why are you bothering with me?

250
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:51,420
I'll go ride after you get on.

251
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:52,660
Horses are meant to be ridden,

252
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:54,220
not for staring at.

253
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:58,020
I don't know how to ride.

254
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,900
What did you say?

255
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:01,700
Looking at you strutting around,

256
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,900
but you don't even know how to ride a horse?

257
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:05,420
How did your father teach you?

258
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,100
So what if I can't ride?

259
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:09,540
If you can't ride...

260
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:11,780
If you can't ride, I'll help you hold the reins.

261
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:14,620
Yes, let him help you hold the reins.

262
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:16,220
Come.

263
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,560
Weren't you going to help me hold the reins?

264
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:22,540
Hold it.

265
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:25,500
Holding... I'm holding.

266
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,660
Come, be careful.

267
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,500
- Thanks.
- Sit steady.

268
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:39,500
Be careful.

269
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,740
What are you looking at? Daydreaming again.

270
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:43,940
Concentrate on walking!

271
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,940
You only know how to bully me.

272
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:47,260
If you keep bullying me, I'll let go.

273
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:47,780
Let go.

274
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:48,300
I'll let go.

275
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:49,940
- Let go.
- I let go.

276
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:52,100
Just joking.

277
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,180
This Eighth Prince...

278
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:02,780
if you want status, he has status;

279
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:04,460
if you want looks, he has looks.

280
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:06,060
A top-grade man.

281
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,460
You'll only anger yourself to death if you keep making comparisons (Chinese idiom)

282
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:11,100
Luckily, right now I'm a Lady.

283
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,260
The name Linglong is perfect.

284
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:15,780
Although the horse isn't small and delicate,

285
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:17,580
but it is agile and swift.

286
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:18,820
Riding it up the hill

287
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:20,140
feels like walking on flat land.

288
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:22,500
Even if I close my eyes, I'm not afraid I'll fall off.

289
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,260
Jiejie,

290
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:33,540
do I not know how to ride?

291
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:35,580
You don't remember again?

292
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,260
Then what should it be?

293
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:44,540
Since young, you didn't know how to ride.

294
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:46,540
No matter how Father tried to force you to learn,

295
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:48,100
you weren't willing to learn.

296
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:50,100
I really don't like horseback riding?

297
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:53,380
Then it's fine then.

298
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,420
Right now,

299
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:58,112
not only do I not hate riding,

300
00:15:58,112 --> 00:15:59,920
I actually quite like it.

301
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:00,820
Next time, Jiejie

302
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:02,860
must come along and play with us.

303
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:06,700
First take a bath, and then let's eat.

304
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:11,700
Eighth Prince is pretty good at taking care of people.

305
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:12,741
With him there,

306
00:16:12,741 --> 00:16:15,260
nothing will go wrong.

307
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:16,595
Next time, Jiejie

308
00:16:16,595 --> 00:16:18,380
must go with us.

309
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:20,450
I'm not interested.

310
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,772
Even if you aren't interested in riding,

311
00:16:22,772 --> 00:16:25,512
but you can go have fun with Eighth Prince

312
00:16:25,512 --> 00:16:27,700
and find some interesting things to do.

313
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:31,580
Eighth Prince is both attentive and refined in manners.

314
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:33,339
Many things, even if you don't say them,

315
00:16:33,339 --> 00:16:35,260
he seems to already understand

316
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:36,820
and is already well prepared.

317
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:41,780
Jiejie, I feel that

318
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:43,693
he treats you pretty well.

319
00:16:44,329 --> 00:16:46,820
Since you're already married to him,

320
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:48,900
why don't you treat him a little better?

321
00:16:49,219 --> 00:16:50,400
This type of man

322
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,702
is still worth fighting for.

323
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:55,024
- Madam.
- Jiejie!

324
00:16:55,024 --> 00:16:56,460
Are you all right?

325
00:16:56,767 --> 00:16:58,228
I'm fine.

326
00:16:58,228 --> 00:17:01,260
Dongyun, go with me to the altar.

327
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:09,281
Qiaohui,

328
00:17:09,281 --> 00:17:11,742
did I say something wrong?

329
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:14,415
No.

330
00:17:14,415 --> 00:17:16,478
Second Miss don't ask me anymore.

331
00:17:16,478 --> 00:17:17,640
Qiaohui,

332
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,010
you understand Jiejie best.

333
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:20,682
You must know.

334
00:17:20,682 --> 00:17:22,500
Second Miss,

335
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:25,140
for two people to become a married couple,

336
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:29,300
they have the fate, but we cannot force their affinity (feelings).

337
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:31,063
Since they can still treat each other with respect,

338
00:17:31,063 --> 00:17:33,540
is already a blessing.

339
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:36,300
What you mean to say is

340
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:39,119
Jiejie doesn't quite like Eighth Prince?

341
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,023
Second Miss,

342
00:17:41,023 --> 00:17:42,866
I didn't say anything.

343
00:17:42,866 --> 00:17:46,140
I dare not guess what Mistress is thinking about.

344
00:17:48,975 --> 00:17:50,638
Qiaohui, when you see Tenth Prince later,

345
00:17:50,638 --> 00:17:52,261
don't say I'm looking for him to play.

346
00:17:52,261 --> 00:17:53,500
Say I'm there to pay my greetings.

347
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:54,399
So that he won't be so pleased with himself.

348
00:17:54,399 --> 00:17:55,096
Don't worry, Miss.

349
00:17:55,096 --> 00:17:57,068
Actually, he's quite amusing as a person.

350
00:17:57,068 --> 00:17:59,761
Say, if he doesn't get insulted by you every few days,

351
00:17:59,761 --> 00:18:00,860
he'll feel terribly suffocated.

352
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:02,826
Even though he can't argue as well as Second Miss,

353
00:18:02,826 --> 00:18:04,298
but he smiles so happily every time.

354
00:18:04,298 --> 00:18:05,900
He's definitely taking pleasure in it.

355
00:18:06,234 --> 00:18:08,492
Actually, Tenth Prince is pretty fun to play with.

356
00:18:08,492 --> 00:18:10,814
He is not scheming, and isn't very knowledgable.

357
00:18:10,814 --> 00:18:12,207
He is also a bit rash.

358
00:18:12,207 --> 00:18:13,818
But simple-minded people like him

359
00:18:13,818 --> 00:18:15,260
are the most suitable to be friends with.

360
00:18:15,662 --> 00:18:16,851
Second Miss,

361
00:18:16,851 --> 00:18:18,523
the few of them are in the study discussing matters.

362
00:18:18,523 --> 00:18:19,730
For us to just walk in on them like this,

363
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:20,799
isn't too good is it?

364
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:21,820
Don't worry.

365
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:24,300
As long as I don't see that ice block Fourth Prince's face, it'll be fine.

366
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:25,721
Qiaohui!

367
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:28,415
Madam... Madam is calling for you.

368
00:18:28,415 --> 00:18:29,994
- Second Miss.
- Go then.

369
00:18:29,994 --> 00:18:31,300
I'll take my leave.

370
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:38,664
Ice block face. Oh god.

371
00:18:38,664 --> 00:18:40,140
Maertai Ruoxi!

372
00:18:47,148 --> 00:18:48,940
Greetings to Fourth Prince.

373
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:55,846
Rise.

374
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:59,553
It seems like you really don't want to see me.

375
00:18:59,553 --> 00:19:01,946
No. I wouldn't dare.

376
00:19:01,946 --> 00:19:04,020
Then what do you mean by running once you see me?

377
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:07,030
I suddenly remembered I had something to do,

378
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:08,826
so I didn't notice Fourth Prince.

379
00:19:08,826 --> 00:19:12,460
I think you're having a guilty conscience, and scared that I'll ask you why you were seeking death that day.

380
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:14,506
The more you don't want to say, the more I must ask.

381
00:19:14,506 --> 00:19:15,760
Tell me.

382
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,660
No. I wasn't.

383
00:19:22,226 --> 00:19:25,100
Seeking to die, but also hoping to live.

384
00:19:25,977 --> 00:19:29,460
You don't want to say, do you? Forget it then.

385
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:43,340
How about this? Let me make an analogy.

386
00:19:44,253 --> 00:19:47,990
You're walking around in a dream, and once you're in the dream,

387
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:51,844
you want to wake up from the dream, but you can't.

388
00:19:51,844 --> 00:19:53,562
What should you do?

389
00:19:55,399 --> 00:19:56,906
Six words.

390
00:19:57,835 --> 00:20:00,820
Make the best out of it.

391
00:20:01,295 --> 00:20:02,540
Understand?

392
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:07,940
Strong wood that don't bend will break.

393
00:20:10,322 --> 00:20:12,700
Forget it. It's like playing zither to a cow.
(idiom meaning the person's too dumb to understand)

394
00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:23,261
Make the best out of it?

395
00:20:25,268 --> 00:20:26,744
I told you to do it like this.

396
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:28,719
I don't think so.

397
00:20:28,719 --> 00:20:30,412
I think it's a pretty good idea to do it here.

398
00:20:30,412 --> 00:20:31,295
What's wrong?

399
00:20:31,295 --> 00:20:33,270
Good, Fourth Brother is here. Why don't

400
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:34,731
we ask for Fourth Brother's opinion?

401
00:20:34,731 --> 00:20:35,892
Fourth Brother.

402
00:20:35,892 --> 00:20:38,780
Weren't you just discussing Tenth Brother's birthday banquet?

403
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:40,025
How did you start arguing?

404
00:20:40,025 --> 00:20:41,326
What were you arguing about?

405
00:20:41,626 --> 00:20:45,041
Fourth Brother, Tenth Brother wants to hold his birthday banquet at my estate,

406
00:20:45,041 --> 00:20:46,248
but the Crown Prince

407
00:20:46,248 --> 00:20:47,999
wants to help Tenth Brother hold a birthday banquet

408
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:49,313
so that we brothers can have fun.

409
00:20:49,313 --> 00:20:51,940
What does Fourth Brother think about this?

410
00:20:52,466 --> 00:20:54,352
Since it's Tenth Brother's birthday,

411
00:20:54,352 --> 00:20:55,956
Crown Prince has already said,

412
00:20:55,956 --> 00:20:57,719
everything should follow Tenth Brother's wishes.

413
00:20:57,719 --> 00:21:00,540
There's nothing wrong with Eighth Brother organizing this.

414
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:01,434
Exactly.

415
00:21:01,434 --> 00:21:03,245
I think it's great to hold it at Eighth Brother's estate.

416
00:21:03,245 --> 00:21:05,614
Crown Prince is making a superfluous move.

417
00:21:06,661 --> 00:21:09,245
Tenth Brother, Crown Prince means well.

418
00:21:09,245 --> 00:21:12,060
He just wants you to be happy on your birthday.

419
00:21:12,342 --> 00:21:15,389
Tenth Brother, Crown Prince cares about his brothers

420
00:21:15,389 --> 00:21:16,411
and regards you as important.

421
00:21:16,411 --> 00:21:18,180
You should be happy.

422
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:20,080
I am already very happy now.

423
00:21:20,416 --> 00:21:21,659
Eighth Brother,

424
00:21:21,659 --> 00:21:23,609
are we holding it at Cefujin's place?

425
00:21:27,157 --> 00:21:28,820
What's going on with you?

426
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:32,060
You want Ruoxi to plan it for you, right?

427
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,878
No.

428
00:21:35,878 --> 00:21:37,218
I was just casually asking.

429
00:21:37,218 --> 00:21:39,236
I was wondering why he argued with me for so long.

430
00:21:39,236 --> 00:21:40,260
You really don't?

431
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:43,184
I was really just casually asking.

432
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,376
Six words.

433
00:21:55,222 --> 00:21:59,300
Make the best out of it. Understand?

434
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:07,020
No wonder he's the future Qing emperor.

435
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:13,137
Make the best you can of things. Bingo!

436
00:22:21,452 --> 00:22:23,085
Play shuttlecock, huh?

437
00:22:23,085 --> 00:22:24,780
Second Miss knows how to play too?

438
00:22:25,299 --> 00:22:26,628
Lil' bit. (slang)

439
00:22:26,628 --> 00:22:27,860
Lil' bit?

440
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:30,531
I finally found

441
00:22:30,531 --> 00:22:32,940
something fun to play with that transcends both time and age.

442
00:22:40,294 --> 00:22:42,860
Second Miss is amazing.

443
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:44,660
Count.

444
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:46,690
- Second Miss.
- Quick, count.

445
00:22:47,412 --> 00:22:49,477
Shuttlecocks can be kicked like this too?

446
00:22:51,477 --> 00:22:53,740
Second Miss is really awesome.

447
00:22:54,714 --> 00:22:56,396
Second Miss.

448
00:22:57,157 --> 00:22:59,740
Second Miss is really amazing.

449
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:05,180
Second Miss can kick it so many times.

450
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:09,260
Greetings to Bei'le.

451
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:14,020
Greetings to Eighth Prince.

452
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:15,380
Rise.

453
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,220
We'll take our leave.

454
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:26,580
Looking at people kicking shuttlecock, and not saying anything.

455
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:28,100
You watched me nap,

456
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:29,740
but didn't say anything either.

457
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:32,940
In the carriage.

458
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:35,020
I'm going to find Ruolan and Difujin

459
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:37,020
to discuss the matter of Tenth Brother's birthday celebration.

460
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:38,340
Come along.

461
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:44,060
Bei'le,

462
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:46,300
I don't have experience with planning these sort of things.

463
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:49,540
Why don't we ask Difujin instead?

464
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:52,700
Minghui is already very busy handling household affairs.

465
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:53,980
What more,

466
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:56,300
this is what Tenth Brother himself wanted.

467
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:58,340
Since Bei'le asked you to do it,

468
00:23:58,340 --> 00:23:59,860
you should do it.

469
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:03,940
Yes. Then I'll organize it then.

470
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:07,340
It's just a family banquet.

471
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:08,700
You don't need to be too nervous.

472
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:11,180
We just want a place to have some fun.

473
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:13,340
If you need anything, feel free to come find me.

474
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:14,580
Remember,

475
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:17,340
don't let Bei'le lose face.

476
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:20,100
Yes. I understand.

477
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:22,340
Thank you, Jiejie.

478
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:26,340
Bei'le,

479
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:28,060
if there isn't any other matters,

480
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:29,780
I'll return first.

481
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:31,580
What time will you be coming tonight?

482
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:33,780
I'll tell the servants to prepare.

483
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:34,820
No need.

484
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:38,100
I'm staying at the South Building tonight.

485
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:54,500
I didn't know Bei'le was staying over tonight.

486
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:57,600
Allow me to make the preparations first.

487
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,400
I'll go see if there's anything I can help with too.

488
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:22,600
This fish isn't fresh; get another one.

489
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,200
Yes.

490
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:26,300
How could you shred the carrot like that?

491
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:28,000
So thick. How do you expect people to eat it?

492
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,600
Yes.

493
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:31,980
Madam.

494
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:35,540
Qiaohui, it is just an everyday family dinner.

495
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:37,500
Don't be so nervous.

496
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:40,260
Madam, that's now how it is.

497
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:41,700
It's rare that Bei'le is staying over,

498
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,620
how can we be sloppy?

499
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:45,940
Bei'le likes to eat the dumplings you make.

500
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:48,540
The dumpling skin has already been prepared for you.

501
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:57,900
Qiaohui,

502
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:59,600
why are you even more nervous than Jiejie?

503
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:03,200
Second Miss, I don't want Madam to be bullied by these servants anymore.

504
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,600
Before, Bei'le rarely came over.

505
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,500
So they think that because Madam is not favored,

506
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,900
they don't have any respect for her.

507
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,900
Does Jiejie know?

508
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,300
Of course, she knows.

509
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:15,600
But Madam herself doesn't care.

510
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,400
I'm feeling indignant on Madam's behalf.

511
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,700
Second Miss, you don't know.

512
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:21,600
Within this household, if you don't have any status,

513
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,200
it's hard to get by.

514
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,700
It's only by letting them know

515
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:26,300
that Bei'le cares about Madam,

516
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:27,600
and regards her as important,

517
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:30,700
then they will respect her more.

518
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:34,400
Tenth Prince's birthday banquet is our chance to show them.

519
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:39,060
Jiejie, let me help you.

520
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,180
Tenth Prince's birthday celebration,

521
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:42,820
we must organize it well.

522
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,180
Don't worry.

523
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:47,500
Since you two are such good friends,

524
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:49,500
your feelings toward him,

525
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:52,100
I already know.

526
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:53,740
What are you talking about?

527
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:56,940
Actually, Tenth Prince

528
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:59,900
wants you to plan his birthday.

529
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:01,060
Do you understand?

530
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:02,380
I know.

531
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:04,500
It's because we have fun playing together.

532
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:08,700
Jiejie, I hope you're not overthinking it.

533
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:12,700
Am I really thinking too much?

534
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:16,580
Yes, you're overthinking.

535
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:41,500
So bored. So bored.

536
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:52,900
Rabbit!

537
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,060
Be good, little rabbit.

538
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:01,060
If you stay with me, you'll have meat to eat. (slang for have a good life)

539
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:04,300
You'll have carrots to eat.

540
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:05,900
Come. Come.

541
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:07,660
Follow the big rabbit home.

542
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:10,100
Running away?

543
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:14,780
Quick, quick, quick. Stop running! Stop running!

544
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:18,420
Tenth Brother, why did you think to have Ruolan plan your birthday?

545
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:20,780
Minghui won't plan it to your liking?

546
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:23,180
Eighth Brother, stop guessing anyhow.

547
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:26,540
Actually, I'm always very happy during my birthday every year.

548
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:27,740
It's only that

549
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:29,380
I feel that Ruoxi has a lot of eccentric ideas.

550
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:31,660
Maybe she'll have something fresh.

551
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:35,420
Stop running! Stop running!

552
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:39,840
Stop running! Stop running!

553
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:40,400
Little rabbit.

554
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,940
Ruoxi?

555
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:45,860
This little girl really is a little eccentric.

556
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:49,180
Hearing isn't the same as seeing; she sure is lively.

557
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:51,280
- Ruoxi!
- Stop running, stop running.

558
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,420
Ruoxi, what are you doing?

559
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:54,140
What happened?

560
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:54,900
Ruoxi.

561
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,580
Eighth Prince, there are rabbits in your estate!

562
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:58,660
Rabbits? Where are the rabbits?

563
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,780
Where did the rabbit go?

564
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:04,340
Hurry and say. Where's the rabbit?

565
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:05,780
It got scared off by you!

566
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:07,300
My fault again?

567
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:09,340
It's okay, it's not like this place is very big.

568
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:11,780
If you want to find it, you'll definitely be able to.

569
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:13,540
Fourteenth Prince.

570
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:15,500
Greetings, Fourteenth Prince.

571
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:17,740
Are you still going to look for the rabbit?

572
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:18,820
Of course.

573
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:21,500
- Then, then hurry and look!
- Look!

574
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:22,780
Lively indeed.

575
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:26,860
Eighth Brother, let's go have a look. Come.

576
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:30,860
Sorry.

577
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:32,820
If not because I chased after you guys to play with you,

578
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:35,860
they wouldn't have captured you to give to me either.

579
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:38,780
They are princes.

580
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:40,340
Since they gave you to me,

581
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:42,660
I can't set you free.

582
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:44,340
But don't worry,

583
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:46,740
I will treat you guys very well.

584
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:49,060
Actually we're all the same,

585
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:51,540
stuck in a cage.

586
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:55,540
I heard that when you fell from the second store

587
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:57,240
you damaged your brain.

588
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,880
Seems like it's true.

589
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:00,100
Who are you?

590
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:01,620
You don't even know who I am now?

591
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:04,740
Your brain really got damaged.

592
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,300
Lady Mingyu was there.

593
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:11,780
She said you fell down by yourself.

594
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,060
Okay then.

595
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:21,700
Seeing as how you're so pitiful,

596
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:22,740
I'll tell you.

597
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:24,260
My elder sister is the Difujin,

598
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:25,700
Gorolo Minghui.

599
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:27,620
Now do you know who I am?

600
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:29,260
I don't know her.

601
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:30,940
Do you guys know?

602
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:33,500
How dare you not hold me in esteem?

603
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:36,540
So what if I don't show you any respect?

604
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:39,020
You!

605
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:43,260
Even your sister has to behave humbly in front of me.

606
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:44,100
Who do you think you are?

607
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:45,540
What right do you have to speak to me like this?

608
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:46,460
You!

609
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,940
Best not to cause problems for Jie Jie.

610
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:52,700
I remember now.

611
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:54,860
You're Difujin's younger sister,

612
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:58,380
Gorolo Mingyu.Correct?

613
00:30:59,204 --> 00:31:02,300
I have to practice my writing. Goodbye.

614
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:03,860
Let's go.

615
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:05,140
Stop there!

616
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:07,580
Is there anything else?

617
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:10,740
Where did you get the rabbits?

618
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:14,300
None of your business. The princes gave them to me.

619
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:15,380
Give them to me.

620
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:17,180
Why should I?

621
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:18,180
I want them.

622
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:19,940
There are no whys.

623
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:22,100
There are always exceptions.

624
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:24,620
Are you giving or not?

625
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:26,900
I've already given, My Lady.

626
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:28,860
Glad that you know what's good for you.

627
00:31:29,437 --> 00:31:30,940
My Lady is mistaken.

628
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:32,780
I've already given you face.

629
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:34,420
You!

630
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:37,940
Give it to me!

631
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:38,980
Stop!

632
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,100
Jiejie!

633
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,140
Mingyu.

634
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:45,420
Let go.

635
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:48,300
It's only an animal.

636
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:50,220
How could you

637
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:53,060
do things that would lower your status just for its sake?

638
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:54,380
That's right.

639
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:56,300
I wouldn't want to

640
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:58,260
lower my status just for this little beast.

641
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:00,740
I'm returning it to you! Little beast.

642
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,100
Very good.

643
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,600
Why did you insist on me bringing him out?

644
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,740
Use him to deal with,

645
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:24,580
deal with bad people.

646
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:26,660
Deal with what bad people?

647
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:27,620
Someone dares to bully you?

648
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:29,540
What a joke. Who would dare to bully me?

649
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:30,580
I just heard

650
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:32,136
that Tenth Prince's dog is extremely loyal,

651
00:32:32,136 --> 00:32:33,740
so I wanted to see it for myself.

652
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:36,780
Tenth Prince, do you come to Eighth Prince's estate often?

653
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:37,820
Yes.

654
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:38,820
Then you must definitely know

655
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:42,180
how the Difujin bullies my sister. Hurry and tell me.

656
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:43,620
No.

657
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:44,953
They get along very well.

658
00:32:44,953 --> 00:32:46,881
Why would she bully your sister?

659
00:32:46,881 --> 00:32:48,692
And to think I thought of you as a real friend.

660
00:32:48,692 --> 00:32:49,946
But you're giving me such an insincere answer.

661
00:32:49,946 --> 00:32:51,107
So not dependable.

662
00:32:51,107 --> 00:32:52,740
Who says I'm answering you insincerely?

663
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:56,340
As a friend, you must be dependable, and be willing to die for each other (literally be stabbed on both sides of the ribs).

664
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:57,980
You don't even dare to tell me the truth.

665
00:32:57,980 --> 00:33:00,302
Of course you can't stab my ribs on both sides!

666
00:33:00,302 --> 00:33:02,252
I'm not an undependable person.

667
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:04,300
What do you want to know?

668
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:06,385
How does the Difujin treat my sister?

669
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:09,250
Between women, of course it's inevitable that there will be rivalry for favor

670
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:11,215
and harsh words exchanged.

671
00:33:11,215 --> 00:33:12,423
"Rivalry for favor?"

672
00:33:12,423 --> 00:33:14,094
She wouldn't hit my sister, would she?

673
00:33:14,094 --> 00:33:15,209
Of course not.

674
00:33:15,209 --> 00:33:16,788
"Even if one does not respect the monk, he has to respect Buddha." (Chinese idiom)

675
00:33:16,788 --> 00:33:18,900
With Eighth Brother there, no way.

676
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:21,014
Then my sister must definitely have been bullied.

677
00:33:21,362 --> 00:33:22,918
Your sister is gentle-tempered.

678
00:33:22,918 --> 00:33:24,613
Of course, she'll get bullied a little.

679
00:33:24,613 --> 00:33:26,099
Let me tell you.

680
00:33:26,099 --> 00:33:28,746
Minghui and her sister are infamous for being extremely unreasonable.

681
00:33:28,746 --> 00:33:31,115
Even I'm a little scared of them.

682
00:33:32,786 --> 00:33:33,933
But,

683
00:33:33,933 --> 00:33:35,759
that Minghui's not that reckless.

684
00:33:35,759 --> 00:33:37,105
As for that Mingyu...

685
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:40,728
What about her?

686
00:33:40,728 --> 00:33:43,180
Sometimes she doesn't even respect me!

687
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:48,660
Hey! You say "Oh" like it's a natural thing for her not to respect me!

688
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:49,740
Don't be mistaken.

689
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:50,689
What I mean to say is,

690
00:33:50,689 --> 00:33:52,082
someone as willful as her

691
00:33:52,082 --> 00:33:53,940
might not even respect the Emperor.

692
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:56,940
She wouldn't dare! Even though her grandfather was one of the dynasty's founding figures,

693
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:59,220
but she wouldn't be that audacious*, would she.
(literally guts are so big, they cover the sky)

694
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:01,370
Her guts may be big, but cannot cover the sky.

695
00:34:01,370 --> 00:34:03,700
But surely, dog's guts can cover the sky*, right?
(*also means audacious)

696
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:06,061
"Dog's guts can cover the sky"?

697
00:34:06,061 --> 00:34:07,020
What does that mean?

698
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:08,290
Where is it?

699
00:34:10,398 --> 00:34:11,900
Here it is.

700
00:34:17,774 --> 00:34:18,956
Coming. Coming.

701
00:34:18,956 --> 00:34:19,852
What?

702
00:34:19,852 --> 00:34:20,745
Let's play over there.

703
00:34:20,745 --> 00:34:22,060
Where?

704
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:25,580
Lady Mingyu is there.

705
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:26,503
So what if she's there?

706
00:34:26,503 --> 00:34:27,820
This is Eighth Prince's estate.

707
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:29,197
Even though it's Eighth Prince's estate,

708
00:34:29,197 --> 00:34:30,604
but we can't create trouble too.

709
00:34:30,604 --> 00:34:32,321
It's better that we go somewhere else to play.

710
00:34:32,321 --> 00:34:33,540
Who's creating trouble?

711
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:35,020
Who's bothering whom?

712
00:34:36,898 --> 00:34:39,580
Here, it's here. There.

713
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:42,500
What are you doing?

714
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:43,468
What does he like to play?

715
00:34:43,468 --> 00:34:44,443
Ball.

716
00:34:44,443 --> 00:34:46,660
- Give me.
- It's there.

717
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:48,540
I still can't catch it.

718
00:34:49,012 --> 00:34:50,976
Higher.

719
00:34:50,976 --> 00:34:52,106
Okay, I'll try again.

720
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:56,982
- I'm so scared!
- Are you all right?

721
00:35:03,455 --> 00:35:05,740
Go away! Go away!

722
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:08,100
Someone! Hurry and go away! Go away!

723
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:09,103
Don't be scared, don't be scared.

724
00:35:09,532 --> 00:35:10,728
Something happened!

725
00:35:10,728 --> 00:35:11,796
Go away!

726
00:35:12,307 --> 00:35:14,100
Lady! Be careful, Lady!

727
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:18,780
Something happened!

728
00:35:20,738 --> 00:35:22,317
- Lady! Lady!
- Lady Mingyu!

729
00:35:22,317 --> 00:35:24,020
Are you all right, Lady Mingyu?

730
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:25,682
- Lady Mingyu!
- It hurts!

731
00:35:25,682 --> 00:35:26,750
Lady Mingyu, are you all right?

732
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:27,780
Lady!

733
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:31,380
It hurts!

734
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:35,824
Sorry.

735
00:35:35,824 --> 00:35:37,740
Whose dog was it?

736
00:35:38,192 --> 00:35:39,475
Mine.

737
00:35:39,475 --> 00:35:41,761
You could've raised anything! Why did you have to raise a dog?

738
00:35:41,761 --> 00:35:42,804
Lady, come.

739
00:35:42,804 --> 00:35:44,380
It's gotten me into such a mess!

740
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:45,953
Beast!

741
00:35:45,953 --> 00:35:47,380
You don't even look before biting!

742
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:49,064
You cannot bully people (literally dog threatening others based on it's master's authority)!

743
00:35:50,793 --> 00:35:55,020
Little beast, no humanity.

744
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:56,448
Lady Mingyu, be the bigger person

745
00:35:56,448 --> 00:35:57,981
and don't be angry at Tenth Prince anymore.

746
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,780
You-you-you...

747
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:02,207
you guys did it on purpose!

748
00:36:02,207 --> 00:36:04,100
I didn't do it on purpose.

749
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:05,504
You!

750
00:36:06,186 --> 00:36:07,176
Stop arguing!

751
00:36:07,176 --> 00:36:08,787
- I'll hit you! I'll hit you!
- Don't hit anymore!

752
00:36:08,787 --> 00:36:10,705
- You hit me?
- I'll hit you to death!

753
00:36:10,705 --> 00:36:11,495
- Stop hitting!
- I'll hit you!

754
00:36:11,495 --> 00:36:13,120
- Come and hit me!
- I'll teach you to ask the dog to bite me!

755
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:14,380
It's hurts!

756
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:16,940
You! You!

757
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:19,088
Here I go!

758
00:36:21,713 --> 00:36:24,020
Pain!

759
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:25,241
- Tenth Prince.
- What kind of girl are you?

760
00:36:25,241 --> 00:36:26,704
You hit so hard.

761
00:36:26,704 --> 00:36:27,586
- It hurts like hell.
- Calm down.

762
00:36:27,586 --> 00:36:28,956
Lower your voice.

763
00:36:29,539 --> 00:36:31,620
Lower your voice, lower your voice.

764
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:33,414
- It hurts so much.
- Please.

765
00:36:33,950 --> 00:36:36,140
- Lower your voice.
- It hurts.

766
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:37,362
If Jiejie hears you,

767
00:36:37,362 --> 00:36:39,080
then there'll be big trouble.

768
00:36:39,570 --> 00:36:40,938
You dare to do it, but don't dare to admit to it.

769
00:36:40,938 --> 00:36:42,284
What kind of hero are you?

770
00:36:42,284 --> 00:36:44,096
I wasn't a hero to start with.

771
00:36:44,096 --> 00:36:45,860
I'm only a coward.

772
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:48,415
Miss, Miss, Miss. It's here.

773
00:36:50,237 --> 00:36:51,860
How will this do?

774
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:52,966
No. No. No.

775
00:36:52,966 --> 00:36:54,359
Xiao Anzi, summon the imperial physician.

776
00:36:54,359 --> 00:36:55,900
- Yes.
- No. No. No.

777
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:57,038
You definitely cannot summon the imperial physician.

778
00:36:57,038 --> 00:36:57,795
If Eighth Prince knows,

779
00:36:57,795 --> 00:36:59,300
the matter will become serious.

780
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:00,907
This won't do, that won't do.

781
00:37:00,907 --> 00:37:02,220
Then what do we do?

782
00:37:03,625 --> 00:37:05,086
What if...

783
00:37:07,108 --> 00:37:09,620
how am I to go out with my face like that?

784
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:11,124
There's no what if.

785
00:37:11,124 --> 00:37:12,842
There's only a thing called foolproof.

786
00:37:12,842 --> 00:37:14,700
Just rub for a while and it'll be fine.

787
00:37:15,043 --> 00:37:16,740
Rub for a while.

788
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:18,660
My birthday is in a few days.

789
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:20,365
How do you expect me to face people?

790
00:37:22,026 --> 00:37:23,084
It's fine, it's fine.

791
00:37:23,084 --> 00:37:23,989
It'll be fine by tonight.

792
00:37:23,989 --> 00:37:25,636
Believe me and you won't go wrong.

793
00:37:25,636 --> 00:37:26,404
Really?

794
00:37:26,404 --> 00:37:27,587
Really!

795
00:37:28,085 --> 00:37:29,839
Tenth Prince, don't worry.

796
00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:31,418
Using boiled eggs to rub your face

797
00:37:31,418 --> 00:37:33,740
and the bruises will fade quickly.

798
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:34,715
It's all right.

799
00:37:36,651 --> 00:37:38,152
Then you guys give it a try then.

800
00:37:38,152 --> 00:37:39,684
Do it lightly.

801
00:37:39,684 --> 00:37:41,124
Lightly, lightly.

802
00:37:42,703 --> 00:37:44,340
I'll do it lightly.

803
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:45,814
Lightly.

804
00:37:45,814 --> 00:37:47,115
Lightly, lightly.

805
00:37:51,744 --> 00:37:55,845
Don't you think it feels less painful now?

806
00:37:55,845 --> 00:37:58,121
Doesn't it feel quite comfortable as well?

807
00:38:01,768 --> 00:38:03,136
Yes.

808
00:38:04,455 --> 00:38:08,152
Then, don't tell others anymore.

809
00:38:08,152 --> 00:38:11,380
Fine then, I won't tell anymore.

810
00:38:12,448 --> 00:38:14,352
But even if you don't tell,

811
00:38:14,352 --> 00:38:16,906
other people might still say it.

812
00:38:16,906 --> 00:38:19,020
Who? Who would dare tell?

813
00:38:23,897 --> 00:38:25,869
Both of you listen carefully.

814
00:38:25,869 --> 00:38:27,076
Everything you saw and heard today,

815
00:38:27,076 --> 00:38:28,609
don't spread a word.

816
00:38:28,609 --> 00:38:29,709
If any of you dare spread the news,

817
00:38:29,709 --> 00:38:31,070
you'll be in for it!

818
00:38:31,070 --> 00:38:31,906
Yes.

819
00:38:31,906 --> 00:38:33,220
Yes.

820
00:38:35,946 --> 00:38:37,260
This will do, right?

821
00:38:38,222 --> 00:38:39,336
Then rub this side too.

822
00:38:39,336 --> 00:38:41,101
Okay. Come. Sit here.

823
00:38:41,101 --> 00:38:42,220
Okay.

824
00:38:46,234 --> 00:38:48,206
But even if they don't talk about it,

825
00:38:48,206 --> 00:38:50,528
there is still someone who might.

826
00:38:51,304 --> 00:38:52,279
Who?

827
00:38:52,279 --> 00:38:54,060
Lady Mingyu.

828
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:56,148
Don't worry about her.

829
00:38:56,148 --> 00:38:57,334
What kind of person who'd gotten into trouble

830
00:38:57,334 --> 00:38:59,027
spill on his own wrongdoings?

831
00:38:59,027 --> 00:39:01,380
Regarding this, I can guarantee it for you.

832
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:02,556
Really?

833
00:39:02,556 --> 00:39:03,540
Let me tell you.

834
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:06,271
In this, I have experience.

835
00:39:10,105 --> 00:39:11,473
Yes.

836
00:39:12,852 --> 00:39:14,384
Be good. It'll be all right.

837
00:39:14,384 --> 00:39:15,977
I'll just rub it for a while longer, and it'll be all right.

838
00:39:15,977 --> 00:39:18,485
Come. Sit.

839
00:39:20,932 --> 00:39:25,340
Isn't it very comfortable?

840
00:39:31,985 --> 00:39:32,960
Does it look good?

841
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,140
It looks good.

842
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:37,200
But I think it's a little too plain.

843
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,431
There's still this outfit.

844
00:39:46,297 --> 00:39:47,240
Does this look good?

845
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:48,462
Looks good.

846
00:39:49,277 --> 00:39:50,459
But I think

847
00:39:50,459 --> 00:39:52,740
the color is a little too light.

848
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:55,289
Second Miss, what do you plan to wear?

849
00:39:55,289 --> 00:39:56,636
I want my clothes to be pretty,

850
00:39:56,636 --> 00:39:58,447
and my makeup to be pretty.

851
00:39:58,447 --> 00:40:00,629
All of Second Miss's clothes are very beautiful.

852
00:40:00,629 --> 00:40:03,648
For Tenth Prince's birthday, I must look festive.

853
00:40:03,648 --> 00:40:04,809
Festive.

854
00:40:10,546 --> 00:40:12,889
This color. How is it?

855
00:40:12,889 --> 00:40:14,004
The color is good.

856
00:40:15,011 --> 00:40:16,651
- Go.
- Jiejie!

857
00:40:18,062 --> 00:40:19,159
Jiejie!

858
00:40:21,490 --> 00:40:23,300
What's different about me today?

859
00:40:24,337 --> 00:40:26,148
Your hair is different.

860
00:40:28,911 --> 00:40:30,940
Eye makeup is also different.

861
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:31,816
Do I look good?

862
00:40:31,816 --> 00:40:33,277
You look good.

863
00:40:34,043 --> 00:40:35,250
Everyone says

864
00:40:35,250 --> 00:40:36,969
that we sisters look similar.

865
00:40:36,969 --> 00:40:38,037
So if I look good,

866
00:40:38,037 --> 00:40:39,848
doesn't Jiejie also look good?

867
00:40:39,848 --> 00:40:41,984
You sure do know how to sweet-talk.

868
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:43,749
I'm speaking the truth.

869
00:40:44,696 --> 00:40:45,871
Jiejie,

870
00:40:45,871 --> 00:40:49,507
and I thought that this Cefujin would have some surprise in mind,

871
00:40:49,507 --> 00:40:51,700
turns out, it's nothing more than this.

872
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:55,730
Looks like we'll have to eat in this empty place tonight.

873
00:40:57,077 --> 00:40:59,020
Greetings, Jiejie*.
(*Minor wives/concubines tend to address the primary wife as elder sister)

874
00:41:13,795 --> 00:41:15,160
Greetings, Difujin.

875
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:16,953
Greetings, Lady Mingyu.

876
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:22,271
Rise.

877
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:27,086
Cefujin plans to celebrate Tenth Prince's birthday here?

878
00:41:27,086 --> 00:41:29,237
Having the meal outside with just the blue sky overhead, and the ground below your feet.

879
00:41:29,237 --> 00:41:31,800
Aren't you afraid you'll humiliate Bei'le

880
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,247
and become a laughingstock?

881
00:41:33,247 --> 00:41:34,586
Bei'le said before

882
00:41:34,586 --> 00:41:37,008
that he hopes to organize a festive family banquet.

883
00:41:37,008 --> 00:41:38,362
I thought that

884
00:41:38,362 --> 00:41:40,638
such a setting is sufficiently ceremonious,

885
00:41:40,638 --> 00:41:43,500
while allowing the princes

886
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:44,780
enjoy themselves without restrictions.

887
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:46,940
Really?

888
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:48,860
I'm only afraid that without having had any experience to compare against,

889
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:50,280
you don't know what is appropriate.

890
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:51,380
Mingyu!

891
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:55,860
Cefujin has already put in a lot of thought.

892
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:59,420
You're right, Jiejie.

893
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:02,180
We are straightforward and honest.

894
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:04,900
We don't know how to be hypocritical.

895
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:07,820
If one doesn't put in effort,

896
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:09,620
how would one get Bei'le to side with her?

897
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:11,660
Mingyu, stop talking

898
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:15,580
or Bei'le will be unhappy.

899
00:42:15,580 --> 00:42:17,740
She has already spoken her mind.

900
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:19,780
Only now do you act magnanimous.

901
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:21,100
Ruoxi!

902
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:23,420
What did you say?

903
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:25,820
Eighth Prince is fair.

904
00:42:25,820 --> 00:42:28,140
Who is being scheming and manipulative?

905
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:29,940
Eighth Prince knows it in his heart.

906
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:32,580
Besides, Jiejie and Eighth Prince's hearts are linked as one.

907
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:34,340
Whatever Eighth Prince is thinking of,

908
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:35,460
Jiejie knows it all.

909
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:36,980
So there's no need to trouble Difujin

910
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:39,260
and Lady to worry about it.

911
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:45,020
Quickly, how's the planning going?

912
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:52,660
Eighth Sister-in-law.

913
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:54,540
Greetings to the Princes.

914
00:42:54,540 --> 00:42:55,660
Rise.

915
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:02,300
Lady Mingyu,

916
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:04,820
really looks radiant today.

917
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:12,740
When did a fairy from the Heavens arrive here?

918
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:17,820
She must be the Ruoxi Tenth Brother speaks about so often.

919
00:43:21,860 --> 00:43:23,060
Right, Twelfth Brother.

920
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:25,540
How did you know she's Ruoxi?

921
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:29,100
The other princes said that there's been a pretty girl who's come to Eighth Brother's estate.

922
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:30,780
Just take a look to see who's the prettiest here.

923
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:32,100
Is there still a need to say anything else?

924
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:36,220
Ruoxi!

925
00:43:36,220 --> 00:43:38,620
How come you look different from how you look normally?

926
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,540
But you still look especially pretty.

927
00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:42,540
Good taste.

928
00:43:42,540 --> 00:43:43,780
Of course.

929
00:43:44,340 --> 00:43:46,700
Ruoxi, is today's decoration all done by you?

930
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:48,820
Eighth Brother, look.

931
00:43:48,820 --> 00:43:50,180
This place is decorated so beautifully.

932
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:51,620
So festive.

933
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:53,940
It was Ruolan's idea.

934
00:43:55,580 --> 00:43:56,820
Thank you, Cefujin!

935
00:43:56,820 --> 00:43:58,300
I especially like it.

936
00:43:58,300 --> 00:44:01,660
Bei'le, I don't feel too well.

937
00:44:01,660 --> 00:44:04,100
I shall return and rest.

938
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:07,060
It isn't something serious, is it?

939
00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:08,860
It's just my head hurts a little.

940
00:44:08,860 --> 00:44:10,620
But don't worry, Bei'le,

941
00:44:10,620 --> 00:44:12,340
it's nothing much.

942
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:16,300
Go back then.

943
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:20,140
Princes, I'll take my leave then.

944
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:24,300
Crown Prince and Thirteenth Brother haven't arrived yet.

945
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:26,900
Fourth Brother, why don't we go to South Building and drink some tea?

946
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:28,380
Okay.

947
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:29,620
Good. Good.

948
00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:32,620
Then we'll wait for him today.

949
00:44:32,620 --> 00:44:34,860
We must make Thirteenth Brother thoroughly drunk.

950
00:44:34,860 --> 00:44:37,900
Tenth Brother, you can't outdrink "Go-All-Out Thirteenth Brother" (gives his utmost in everything).

951
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:39,900
Even Yama (Chinese King of Hell) is afraid of ghosts who gives their utmost.

952
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:51,500
But, I like it!

953
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:08,060
Miss.

954
00:45:08,060 --> 00:45:10,020
Miss, what's wrong?

955
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:13,340
Nothing. Just daydreaming.

956
00:45:13,340 --> 00:45:15,560
Qiaohui, I'm hungry.

957
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:17,220
Go get me something to eat.

958
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:18,740
Then I'll go grab you something to eat.

959
00:45:18,740 --> 00:45:20,460
Wait for me at North Building.

960
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:26,780
Second Miss, food's here.

961
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:28,660
What's wrong?

962
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:31,500
That Gorolo Mingyu.

963
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:32,740
I've seen her so many times,

964
00:45:32,740 --> 00:45:34,780
today was the time she was the most arrogant.

965
00:45:34,780 --> 00:45:36,100
Her mother

966
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:37,780
is the Emperor's cousin,

967
00:45:37,780 --> 00:45:39,660
Princess Heshuo.

968
00:45:39,660 --> 00:45:41,700
Her father is Mingshang Prince Consort.

969
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:43,940
Her sister is Bei'le's Difujin.

970
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:46,100
Naturally, her status isn't ordinary.

971
00:45:46,100 --> 00:45:47,000
So what?

972
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,220
Who's afraid of whom? What can she do to me?

973
00:45:49,220 --> 00:45:51,780
Second Miss is still so competitive.

974
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:54,300
It's called a reasonable self-defense.

975
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:56,620
Please don't get into another accident.

976
00:45:56,620 --> 00:46:00,740
You were already taught a lesson here the last time. And you're doing it again.

977
00:46:01,020 --> 00:46:02,900
Taught a lesson?

978
00:46:04,820 --> 00:46:08,460
I fell down the stairs the last time.

979
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:12,820
Could it be her?

980
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:16,780
Second Miss, I didn't say anything.

981
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:19,980
I-I didn't say anything.

982
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:29,500
Didn't say anything.

983
00:46:41,380 --> 00:46:42,820
Got it.

984
00:47:10,450 --> 00:47:16,620
♫  Stopping here, afraid to go any further ♫

985
00:47:16,620 --> 00:47:22,270
♫  So sorrow will be unable to make an appearance  ♫

986
00:47:23,270 --> 00:47:29,370
♫  On the next page, the farewell penned by you, ♫

987
00:47:29,370 --> 00:47:35,030
♫ it was not up to me to refuse  ♫

988
00:47:36,030 --> 00:47:42,490
♫  We’ve walked down this path too hastily  ♫

989
00:47:42,490 --> 00:47:48,910
♫  Embracing desires that weren’t realistic  ♫

990
00:47:48,910 --> 00:47:55,430
♫  Not in time, wasn’t able to wait long enough to look back and admire  ♫

991
00:47:55,430 --> 00:48:00,740
♫  The fragrance of magnolia is unable to hide wounds  ♫

992
00:48:00,740 --> 00:48:07,220
♫  No longer looking for the sunlight peeking through the clouds  ♫

993
00:48:07,220 --> 00:48:13,760
♫  No longer looking for the paradise that we promised each other  ♫

994
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:20,220
♫  No longer sighing, you once said that life is unpredictable  ♫

995
00:48:20,220 --> 00:48:27,360
♫  The three inches of sunlight that I was unable to borrow  ♫

996
00:48:30,090 --> 00:48:36,530
♫  No longer looking for the sunlight peeking through the clouds  ♫

997
00:48:36,530 --> 00:48:42,890
♫  No longer looking for the paradise that we promised each other  ♫

998
00:48:42,890 --> 00:48:49,490
♫  No longer sighing, you once said that life is unpredictable  ♫

999
00:48:49,490 --> 00:48:55,660
♫  The three inches of sunlight that I was unable to borrow  ♫

1000
00:48:55,660 --> 00:49:04,500
♫  That paradise is the place where I’d loved you  ♫
