00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:20,290
♫  In the blink of an eye, a thought of stubborn persistence  ♫

3
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,400
♫  We were destined to seek our doom like moths flying towards the flame  ♫

4
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:30,820
♫  Knowing that it’d be a disaster, why am I still at a loss about what to do  ♫

5
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:39,180
♫  The best is not to see, the best is not to miss you  ♫

6
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:44,380
♫  Only like this can I not be in love with you  ♫

7
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:47,950
♫  Just another brushing of the shoulder, and from then...♫

8
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:53,370
♫  I’ll keep falling deeper and deeper in love with you  ♫

9
00:00:55,690 --> 00:01:02,330
♫  It’s the mistake of time, forcing us to pass each other by  ♫

10
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:05,640
♫  How I miss you, how far you are  ♫

11
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:12,150
♫  Even though I’d known it’d only result in pain, at this moment, I still don’t want to escape  ♫

12
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:16,640
♫  Pity these words are too glaring they hurt the eyes  ♫

13
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:22,580
♫  Two worlds later ♫

14
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:25,530
♫  Don’t want to escape  ♫

15
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:30,540
♫  It’s the mistake of time, we can only pass each other by  ♫

16
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:35,320
♫  The magnitude of me missing you is as much as how far you are   ♫

17
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:41,100
♫  Even though I know the ending is a mistake that I cannot oppose  ♫

18
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:45,980
♫  Staying in this moment  ♫

19
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:53,380
♫  We can only accept that the feelings run deep, but fate is shallow  ♫

00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:02,040
Scarlet Heart
Episode 8

21
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,460
The peony is elegant and poised,

22
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:13,939
grand and regal. It's the king of flowers.

23
00:02:13,939 --> 00:02:15,300
It suits the Crown Prince

24
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,660
perfectly.

25
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:24,620
The magnolia has clear white petals, gives people a refreshing feeling,

26
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:26,580
it's noble and dazzling.

27
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,780
It truly is Fourth Prince.

28
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,980
Plum blossoms show noble character and unquestionable integrity,

29
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:34,500
it's independent and revolutionary,

30
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,780
but also tenacious and modest.

31
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:39,020
It really is like my Thirteenth Prince.

32
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:43,660
Ruoxi, you make observations of people

33
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:45,180
with great attention to details.

34
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:46,580
Thank you for your praise, Your Majesty.

35
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:50,260
What are your thoughts on my children?

36
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:54,620
A father know his son best.

37
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:56,800
They are all your sons.

38
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,480
Your Majesty knows every prince's personality and habits like the back of your palm.

39
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,180
Each of the princes have their unique characters,

40
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:03,420
like the numerous flowers.

41
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:04,420
Well said.

42
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:08,480
All my sons

43
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,140
have unique characters of their own,

44
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:13,300
even their temperaments are different.

45
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,980
- Greetings to Thirteenth Prince.
- You may rise.

46
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:24,140
Thirteenth Prince!

47
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:26,740
What's wrong?

48
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:27,780
What's wrong?

49
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:29,900
Didn't you promise that you'd teach me horse riding last night?

50
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,140
Why didn't you make good on your promise?

51
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:32,660
Didn't Fourth Brother go in my place?

52
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:35,380
It's you, Thirteenth Prince, who promised to teach me horse riding.

53
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:38,420
Last night, the Crown Prince was talking to me,

54
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:39,580
that's why I didn't go.

55
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:41,220
Fine, fine.

56
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:43,140
I'll go teach you tonight.

57
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:44,080
WIll that do?

58
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,080
Are you sure?

59
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,580
Sure! You wait for me.

60
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:57,420
This Ruoxi really is something.

61
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:59,300
When she gets mad,

62
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:01,380
it's like she wants to eat you.

63
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:03,200
No wonder the olden classics say,

64
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,980
'Women and despicable people are the hardest to deal with.'

65
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:08,060
This is called individuality,

66
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:09,880
and being different from others.

67
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,780
Eh? Fourth Brother,

68
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:13,020
you only went horse riding with her once,

69
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:15,020
and you suddenly seem to know her so well?

70
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:19,180
Don't underestimate horse riding.

71
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:22,000
You can see a person's true character from horse riding.

72
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,400
Although Ruoxi

73
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,139
is normally calm and prudent,

74
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:27,740
in her, she has a fearless spirit of adventure.

75
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:29,220
Her courage

76
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:30,980
comes from well within.

77
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:36,500
It seems like the more Fourth Brother gets to know her, the more you admire her.

78
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:41,020
Thirteenth Prince!

79
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,060
- It's great that you're here!
- Princess Minmin.

80
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:45,420
How come you're here?

81
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:47,760
Tonight, we're preparing another round of buzkashi (goat grabbing).

82
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:50,300
This time, I definitely won't lose to you again. I'll show you.

83
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:52,100
Tonight?

84
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,340
You have something going on?

85
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:56,740
I promised to teach someone horse riding.

86
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:58,020
Why don't we do it on another day?

87
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:59,620
What's there to teach about horse riding?

88
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:00,780
Just come with me!

89
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:03,340
Don't be a wet blanket and dampen everyone's spirits! Come on!

90
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:04,380
You go ahead.

91
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:06,900
I'm free tonight anyway.

92
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,180
I'll teach her horse riding

93
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:10,940
All right then.

94
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:13,020
Since my Fourth Brother is willing to teach horse riding,

95
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,420
all right then, we'll go play buzkashi.

96
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:16,180
Great! Let's go! Thank you.

97
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:18,100
Let's go, hurry!

98
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:48,540
Greetings to Fourth Prince.

99
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:49,540
Excused.

100
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:53,100
I was on duty earlier in the day,

101
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,700
and am feeling a little tired now.

102
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:56,460
I won't bother Fourth Prince tonight anymore.

103
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:57,780
Your servant takes her leave.

104
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:11,340
Let go!

105
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:13,100
Isn't this what you want?

106
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:41,200
If Fourth Prince likes to do it by forcing others,

107
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,320
your servant will not be able to refuse.

108
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:54,140
Why do I have to force you?

109
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:08,340
Let's go.

110
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:20,180
Pull back a little.

111
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:24,460
More to the left.

112
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,460
You must practice more.

113
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:50,780
Yes, Imperial Father.

114
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:06,780
Ruoxi. Ruoxi!

115
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,600
Your Majesty.

116
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:12,740
What happened? You don't look good.

117
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:14,520
You look like you lost your soul.

118
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:17,180
It's probably... because I practiced horse riding last night,

119
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:18,640
and was too tired.

120
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,100
Even if you like horse riding,

121
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,540
you should also know when to stop.

122
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:22,860
Yes.

123
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:23,740
Greetings to Imperial Father.

124
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:25,220
My respects to Imperial Father.

125
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:26,380
Rise.

126
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:27,300
Thank you, Imperial Father.

127
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:34,740
Looks like

128
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:36,860
the coach who taught you horse riding last night

129
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:39,020
must have been severe, but also did his duty well.

130
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,080
Good!

131
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:57,820
Crown Prince,

132
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:59,500
your archery skills have improved quite a bit.

133
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,620
Many thanks for your praise, Imperial Father.

134
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:03,180
Come, let me have a try too.

135
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,260
First Prince is pretty good too.

136
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:18,220
Good archery skills.

137
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:26,900
Thirteenth Brother, it's no effort at all for you to hit the bull's eye.

138
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,220
Come show everyone

139
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:30,500
what good archery skills look like.

140
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:35,360
Big brother, just now,

141
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,940
I accidentally got some sand in my eyes.

142
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:38,260
I won't join in today.

143
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:39,300
You guys have fun.

144
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:45,780
All right then, let us continue.

145
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,660
Tonight, I'll come and find you.

146
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:01,800
Fourth Brother, yesterday night,

147
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,880
aside from Ruoxi learning horseback riding from you,

148
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,320
what else happened?

149
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:08,600
Earlier, didn't she keep trying to find a chance to talk to you? Is she all right?

150
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,440
She didn't say anything.

151
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:13,060
But, I just feel that she's a bit strange.

152
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:14,420
Like she's angry,

153
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:16,060
but also like she suffered some grievances.

154
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:18,660
How is it that she became like this

155
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,500
only after a night of learning horse riding?

156
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,340
Is it because Fourth Brother is too severe,

157
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:23,260
and doesn't know how to be gentle to women,

158
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:24,340
and made her angry?

159
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,420
Thirteenth Brother,

160
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:29,140
in your opinion, how do you think Ruoxi treats me?

161
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:30,820
She treats Fourth Brother...

162
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:32,760
It can be said that she's always taken extra good care of you.

163
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:35,120
It wouldn't be too exaggerated to say that

164
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,380
she cares for you and has feelings for you.

165
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:38,620
It's just she doesn't dare get too close to you.

166
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:46,100
From now on, I won't teach Ruoxi horse riding anymore.

167
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:48,740
I'll leave her matters back in your hands.

168
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:52,780
But,

169
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,340
she probably will not agree to learn horse riding again.

170
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,780
Ruoxi,

171
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:31,740
how did I offend you?

172
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:34,580
I'm telling you,

173
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:36,780
the stare you gave me this morning on the archery field

174
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:37,860
was really vicious.

175
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:39,060
If it'd been someone else,

176
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:41,060
even if they didn't die, they'd have gotten internal injuries.

177
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,180
Then, Thirteenth Prince,

178
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:44,820
how has your servant offended you, then?

179
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:46,540
To have you to stand me up again and again.

180
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:48,780
In this, you have really misunderstood me.

181
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:50,740
The first time, I was called back by the Crown Prince.

182
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:51,780
Even though he just wanted to talk about trivial matters,

183
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:53,500
but it wouldn't be good for me to reject him, would it?

184
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:54,420
The second time, I...

185
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,780
I really didn't lie to you.

186
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:00,980
I really had something on.

187
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:04,180
Who? Other than the Emperor and the Crown Prince,

188
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:06,260
who else could keep you?

189
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:10,540
Princess Minmin.

190
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:14,620
So that's how it is.

191
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:18,860
You abandoned me and chose Princess Minmin,

192
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:20,960
there's really nothing I can say about it.

193
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,620
What do you mean by those words?

194
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:24,180
Who are we?

195
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:25,980
Of course, you're more important to me.

196
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:27,980
But in Minmin's heart, you are more important.

197
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:30,060
I think, she likes you quite a bit.

198
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:31,780
I don't think Minmin likes me.

199
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:37,140
But why do I feel like

200
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:41,360
you fancy my Fourth Brother?

201
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,660
Now that I think about it,

202
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:44,060
me asking to teach you horse riding this time

203
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:45,820
can also be counted as doing you a favor.

204
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:48,820
You should be thankful to me instead.

205
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:50,220
Doing me a favor?

206
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:52,000
Since when did I like Fourth Prince?

207
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:52,900
You're still not admitting to it?

208
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:55,540
All right then. Since

209
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:58,820
you serving tea at the Emperor's side,

210
00:12:58,820 --> 00:12:59,940
I've always thought that

211
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:01,540
you treat my Fourth Brother a bit strangely.

212
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:03,060
Towards Crown Prince,

213
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:04,220
you behave coolly,

214
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:05,020
but to my Fourth Brother...

215
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:06,220
you seem to pay special attention to him.

216
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:07,580
You even asked me about

217
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:09,700
what Fourth Brother usually likes and dislikes.

218
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:11,660
Even the tea sets and snacks you usually serve

219
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:13,420
are all those that he likes.

220
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:15,960
To the other princes,

221
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,260
you are much less attentive.

222
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:20,100
If you don't like him,

223
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:22,820
I really can't think

224
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:24,540
of any other reason for that.

225
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:25,740
I don't.

226
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,240
You're still feeling shy about it?

227
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,340
Let me tell you,

228
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:31,340
it's only because we are close, that I'm telling you.

229
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:33,280
My Fourth Brother,

230
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:36,460
actually has feelings for you too.

231
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:37,740
Otherwise,

232
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:39,620
given his personality,

233
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:43,260
he definitely wouldn't have personally taught a palace maid horse riding.

234
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:44,180
How is that possible?

235
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:46,980
With his character, other than himself, he wouldn't like anyone else.

236
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:48,700
How could he like a palace maid?

237
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:02,340
Ruoxi,

238
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:05,660
everyone has feelings,

239
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:07,020
my Fourth Brother is no different.

240
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:09,900
I don't know what happened between you two.

241
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:12,020
Today, when I mentioned you to him,

242
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:13,260
he didn't say much,

243
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:15,020
and I didn't want to ask too much either.

244
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,300
But I'm guessing

245
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:19,360
that he must have done something to express his feelings for you, didn't he?

246
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,440
He--

247
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:23,820
I don't want to know his matters.

248
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,260
Ruoxi,

249
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:29,980
my Fourth Brother is someone who looks cold on the outside, but is warm on the inside.

250
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:31,100
He is a loyal person.

251
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:32,660
Look at how he treats me and you should know,

252
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:34,420
actually, he--

253
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:35,500
I'm going back.

254
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:40,660
Thirteenth Prince, from now on, please

255
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:42,580
don't try to link me and Fourth Prince together.

256
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:45,420
Also, I definitely won't try to learn horse riding again.

257
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:54,860
You're really not learning horse riding?

258
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:59,260
My Fourth Brother really guessed it right.

259
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:06,580
It truly is that the sins we bring upon ourselves are the hardest to weather.

260
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:08,540
If I'm attentive towards all of Fourth Prince's matters,

261
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:10,520
that's because I know history too well.

262
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,760
He's the future Emperor of the Great Qing Empire,

263
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,140
how can I not be respectful towards him?

264
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:17,140
Who'd have thought that in other people's eyes,

265
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:19,720
it'd appear as if I have romantic feelings towards him?

266
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,540
Even Thirteenth Prince has misunderstood me,

267
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:23,100
not to mention Fourth Prince?

268
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:26,600
It's all my fault.

269
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,700
How am I to explain this misunderstanding?

270
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:30,620
How can I tell them the truth?

271
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:55,860
Why is it that everything I do is wrong?!

272
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:57,060
Everything I do is wrong!

273
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:03,140
- Jiejie, what's going on with you?
- Don't hold me back!

274
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:06,300
- Pick it up. Hurry and pick it up.
- Don't pick it up!

275
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:39,260
Sorry.

276
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:42,500
I shouldn't be throwing tantrums.

277
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:48,760
Jiejie, what's wrong?

278
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,700
Did you scald yourself? I'll go get the medicine.

279
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:52,220
Yunxiang, go clean up the mess.

280
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,220
I remember that before leaving the capital,

281
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:02,300
you warned me to be careful in everything I did.

282
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:06,740
At that time, I thought that I was already doing very well.

283
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:09,380
Who'd have thought that I'm still not doing well enough?

284
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:13,980
I hope that you will do better than me.

285
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:15,460
Don't make mistakes.

286
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:19,179
Recently, in Jiangzhe and other areas,

287
00:17:19,179 --> 00:17:20,900
there have been lowly peasants gathering,

288
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:23,540
using the expensive price of rice as a reason to rob rich people.

289
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:29,620
How should we deal with this matter?

290
00:17:33,379 --> 00:17:35,580
First, waive the rental price of farmland and open the granary (and distribute grain to the poor)

291
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:37,400
to let the poor have a break from the troubles.

292
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,720
At the same time,

293
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,560
we need to tighten the law, and

294
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:43,580
arrest the ringleaders of those troublemakers in the various provinces,

295
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:44,860
as a warning to the masses, as well as to appease them.

296
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:47,980
Everybody, what do you think?

297
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:53,660
Minister Li,

298
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:56,660
do you think this policy is suitable?

299
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:59,260
Minister is one of the Emperor's most trusted officals,

300
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:00,680
I will definitely humbly listen

301
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,300
and learn from Minister's advice.

302
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:05,120
Beile, as the country's supervising ruler,

303
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,680
and representing the Emperor to handle court affairs,

304
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:10,240
are you going to waver and be indecisive

305
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,740
over such a trivial matter,

306
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:14,540
and insist on depending on my opinion?

307
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:16,180
Are you being modest,

308
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:19,100
or afraid of taking responsibility?

309
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:23,860
Reporting to Master, according to the Imperial Physician's message,

310
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:25,420
Eighteenth Prince is seriously ill,

311
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:27,940
and his situation doesn't appear optimistic.

312
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:31,980
You may take your leave.

313
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:33,320
Yes.

314
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,340
Eighth Brother,

315
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:36,420
should we let Imperial Father know that he should return immediately?

316
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:37,740
I do not agree.

317
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:39,540
His Majesty is away beyond the Great Wall,

318
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:42,020
and working hard for our land;

319
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:46,760
we shouldn't let His Majesty worry over matters of the palace.

320
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,980
Exactly! To have the Emperor of the Qing Dynasty

321
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:50,940
disregard everything else and return to the capital,

322
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:53,860
just because of the illness of one prince, out of the many princes?

323
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:56,280
It'd definitely make him a joke in front of the Mongols.

324
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,440
Matters of the palace

325
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,380
should also be handled by the one who's supervising the country.

326
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:02,100
What's most important now

327
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,020
is the health of Eighteenth Brother.

328
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:05,180
I'll go visit him first

329
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:06,380
and decide later.

330
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:08,820
Minister Li,

331
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:10,520
could you please go with me?

332
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,640
Yes.

333
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,740
Please.

334
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:23,500
Imperial Physician, how is the illness of Eighteenth Brother?

335
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,340
Eighteenth Prince's illness

336
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:27,000
keeps coming and going,

337
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,780
and also, it's highly risky.

338
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:31,340
Whether or not he will be able to weather it,

339
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:33,820
I'm afraid, it will be very difficult to predict.

340
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:51,540
Imperial Father, Imperial Father.

341
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:53,220
Child, be good.

342
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:55,020
Imperial Father will return home very soon.

343
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:24,860
That is Eighteenth Prince's drawing.

344
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:26,120
He kept saying

345
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:28,000
that when His Majesty returns,

346
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,400
he wants to personally hand it to His Majesty.

347
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,240
But now...

348
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,800
I'm afraid that he won't have the chance to do it anymore.

349
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:39,860
Beile!

350
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:41,260
You shouldn't be doing this.

351
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:42,460
That's right, it is only a small matter.

352
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:43,620
Why do you have to make such a big fuss out of it?

353
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:45,900
Who knows, His Majesty might not even have the intention to return,

354
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:47,540
and he'll blame us in the end!

355
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:48,420
That's right!

356
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:53,500
I only wish to let everyone have a look at this drawing.

357
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:56,920
In this drawing,

358
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,360
what I see

359
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:00,580
isn't some emperor or prince,

360
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:02,580
but only a father and son.

361
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:04,140
When your own son is severely ill,

362
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:05,460
as a father,

363
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:06,820
how can it be just a trivial matter?

364
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:08,500
And how can you be indifferent about it?

365
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:12,520
Only an emperor with a heart of a stone

366
00:21:13,345 --> 00:21:15,220
will be shamed by people.

367
00:21:23,959 --> 00:21:26,700
Eighteenth Brother is too pitiful.

368
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:29,720
Eighth Brother,

369
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,700
if anything bad were to happen to him,

370
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:34,440
Imperial Father would definitely wish to see him for the last time.

371
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:37,380
If Imperial Father isn't able to get back in time to see his son off,

372
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:41,740
you won't be able to bear this responsibility even if your head rolls!

373
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:45,460
If Beile continues to be this stubborn,

374
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:47,053
there's nothing we can say either.

375
00:21:47,053 --> 00:21:47,680
Yes.

376
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,100
As the person supervising the country,

377
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:51,160
I have the authority to make all decisions anyway.

378
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,420
I'll take responsibility

379
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:53,741
for all consequences.

380
00:21:53,741 --> 00:21:55,420
Eighth Brother!

381
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:57,780
Cool down.

382
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:00,335
I believe

383
00:22:00,335 --> 00:22:01,860
that what Beile did was absolutely right.

384
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:03,160
I have faith that all of us

385
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:06,340
will support Beile's decision.

386
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:10,420
Immediately gather all the imperial physicians

387
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:12,260
to diagnose and treat Eighteenth Prince.

388
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:13,940
Update me at all times.

389
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:17,460
Eighth Brother, I reckon

390
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:19,352
that you were relying too much on your emotions when deciding just now.

391
00:22:19,352 --> 00:22:20,546
Why?

392
00:22:20,546 --> 00:22:22,460
Eighteenth Brother is our biological little brother.

393
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:24,640
Is it wrong to care for your brother too?

394
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,460
No doubt we should feel sorry for Eighteenth Brother,

395
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:27,580
but what Ninth Brother said

396
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:28,780
makes sense as well.

397
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:32,460
As the supervising ruler,

398
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:35,360
every step Eighth Brother takes is like walking on knife blades.

399
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:38,700
If he does well, it's true that he will be praised by Imperial Father,

400
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:40,220
but once he makes a mistake,

401
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:41,460
the Crown Prince and his gang

402
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:42,500
will take the opportunity to attack.

403
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:44,900
It's hard to predict whether

404
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:46,020
Eighth Brother's decision this time is right or wrong.

405
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:52,620
Eighth Brother, you've also seen just now,

406
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:55,220
that the Crown Prince's people,

407
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:57,100
even though they appear to comply on the surface,

408
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:59,220
in their hearts, they remain unconvinced.

409
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:02,420
I'm not relying on my emotions to make decisions.

410
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:05,340
It is exactly to contend against Crown Prince

411
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:07,940
that I need to make such a decision.

412
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:13,240
Imperial Father greatly values kinship.

413
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:15,540
Notifying Imperial Father to ask him to return to see Eighteenth Brother,

414
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:17,620
not only does it show fraternal love,

415
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:19,960
but also satisfies that of father and son.

416
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,540
There's absolutely nothing to disapprove of.

417
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:24,940
But the problem is that Crown Prince's group aren't happy about it.

418
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:29,300
Just now, I asked Minister Li to visit Eighteenth Brother with me.

419
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:31,660
From his expression,

420
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:32,620
I knew

421
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:34,460
that he would definitely agree with my decision.

422
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:37,260
Minister Li's standing in court is one of great importance.

423
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:39,060
Just now, after he voiced his agreement,

424
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:41,660
the other officials didn't dare say anything else either.

425
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:43,380
As long as we have Minister Li's support,

426
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:46,580
a lot of matters will be easy to deal with.

427
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:48,660
Also,

428
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:51,940
in the future.

429
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:58,700
Why is it the more you talk, the more off topic it gets?

430
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:00,180
What does this have to do with the future?

431
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,460
What's going on?

432
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:26,900
Pass down the order

433
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:29,260
to have them send news speedily on fast horses every day.

434
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:30,220
Yes.

435
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:31,220
Pass the order down,

436
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:34,140
Eighteenth Prince is seriously ill,

437
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:36,260
we will set off on the journey back to the capital in three days.

438
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:39,820
Prepare for me

439
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:42,420
to see King Guwalgiya.

440
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:43,660
Yes.

441
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:47,960
Jiejie,

442
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,140
you have a way

443
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:51,660
for us to pack so many things in so short a time?

444
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:53,740
Because I have three heads and six arms.

445
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:54,900
Ruoxi!

446
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:57,440
- Princess Minmin-
- No need to bow.

447
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,800
You are Ruoxi?

448
00:24:58,800 --> 00:24:59,940
Yes.

449
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:01,140
Then hurry and tell me

450
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:02,420
where is Thirteenth Prince?

451
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:03,020
He...

452
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:04,460
He always mentions you in front of me.

453
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:05,840
You must know where he is!

454
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,280
Quickly tell me!

455
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,100
I...

456
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:11,400
If you don't tell me, I won't let you leave!

457
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,420
Princess,

458
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:14,580
I am very willing to tell you,

459
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:16,660
but I really don't know where Thirteenth Prince is.

460
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:20,460
We are going to be returning to Mongolia very soon,

461
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:23,940
but I searched the entire campsite, and still couldn't find him.

462
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:27,300
Could it be that he has forgotten about me?

463
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:28,340
Princess!

464
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:34,060
Princess, don't worry.

465
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:36,300
Thirteenth Prince is a genuine person who deeply values emotional ties;

466
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:37,620
he's independent and does as he pleases.

467
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:39,780
That's why it's so difficult to trace his whereabouts.

468
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:42,020
But he's also someone who will keep caring for someone.

469
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:43,660
He definitely won't forget Princess.

470
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:44,700
Who knows?

471
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:46,200
He might even be thinking about Princess right now.

472
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,180
Really?

473
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:50,260
Even though I really don't know where Thirteenth Prince is,

474
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:54,260
if you can find the most expansive place on these plains,

475
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:56,980
you will probably be able to find him.

476
00:25:58,720 --> 00:25:59,560
I understand now!

477
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,420
Thank you, Ruoxi. You're great!

478
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:06,980
Looks like Princess Minmin

479
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:08,980
has a thing for Thirteenth Prince.

480
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:13,300
Then if you do this, aren't you helping to matchmake Thirteenth Prince without his consent?

481
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:14,740
Aren't you afraid of him scolding you?

482
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:17,060
I am only repaying him

483
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:18,380
for what he did to me.

484
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:23,380
Actually, it's not too big a deal either.

485
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:24,620
Right now, everyone is

486
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:26,420
feeling worried about the matter of Eighteenth Prince.

487
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:28,580
I hope that Princess Minmin's

488
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:29,740
candid personality

489
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:31,380
will help Thirteenth Prince

490
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:32,740
ease his worries.

491
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:36,340
Let's go pack.

492
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:51,660
Thirteenth Prince!

493
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:01,520
Thirteenth Prince, you really are here!

494
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,080
Sorry, Princess.

495
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,020
I'm not in the mood to play with you today.

496
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:06,460
I want to be alone for a while.

497
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:07,460
It's all right.

498
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:09,140
I know that you're in a bad mood.

499
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:11,260
Regarding the matter of Eighteenth Prince's illness,

500
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:12,700
my father has already told me about it.

501
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:14,380
I don't want you to accompany me to play,

502
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:16,220
but I want to keep you company here.

503
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,640
Princess, it's best that you return.

504
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:22,660
Thirteenth Brother!

505
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:25,620
I've been looking for you all day, turns out you were here all along.

506
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:29,760
Come. Come. Come.

507
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,300
Come drink with me!

508
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:33,100
Crown Prince,

509
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:34,540
seems like you've already had a lot to drink.

510
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:36,460
No.

511
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,080
Princess Minmin,

512
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,220
come drink with us.

513
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:43,180
I'm not going!

514
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:44,560
Your own brother is currently sick.

515
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:46,140
You still have the mood to drink?

516
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:48,400
Aren't you worried for him?

517
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,980
What are you saying?

518
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:53,060
Today, I insist that you drink with me.

519
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:54,540
Crown Prince.

520
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:55,500
Thirteenth Brother.

521
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:56,700
You can't take her away.

522
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:58,620
Why are you fighting with me?

523
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:01,020
It's just a princess.

524
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:03,220
Today, I insist on bringing her with me! Let's go!

525
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:04,560
Crown Prince!

526
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:06,520
Forgive your brother for being presumptuous.

527
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:08,220
I've already made plans with her today.

528
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:13,260
I'll take my leave. Let's go.

529
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,180
Thank you so much

530
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:24,860
for helping me to get rid of that annoying guy.

531
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:27,580
Actually, I admire you.

532
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:28,440
If you don't like it,

533
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,140
you won't do it no matter who asks it of you.

534
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:32,220
All right. It's safe here.

535
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:33,020
I'll make a move first.

536
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:37,180
Do you really like to be alone that much?

537
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:40,620
Don't worry, having been disturbed by you like that,

538
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:42,400
I feel a lot better now.

539
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,080
I'm really envious of Ruoxi.

540
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:46,220
You envy her? Why?

541
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:48,580
Because she can return to the capital with you!

542
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:50,300
Because the two of you have a very close relationship!

543
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:53,420
When I couldn't find you,

544
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:55,220
she was the only one who knew where you were.

545
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:57,220
She knows everything you're thinking of.

546
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:00,100
Not only am I envious of her, I'm jealous too!

547
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:03,660
What are you laughing at?

548
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:04,740
No matter when and where,

549
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:06,100
she can guess what others are thinking.

550
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:07,580
That is Ruoxi's strength.

551
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:08,460
It has nothing to do with me.

552
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:10,660
But saying that we're close,

553
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:11,860
this part is the truth.

554
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:15,020
Then, do you like Ruoxi?

555
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:16,520
Like?

556
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:20,120
The two of us are are hard to find good bros who share common interests at heart.

557
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:21,980
Good bros?

558
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:23,040
Yes.

559
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:25,380
We can drink and talk.

560
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:26,780
We can talk until the morning after

561
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:28,000
and still have more to say.

562
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,500
Every time, after we've sobered from the wine,

563
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:31,180
we'll plan when to drink together again.

564
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:33,020
Then I, too, want to be good bros with you!

565
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:34,120
My alcohol tolerance

566
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:35,500
is definitely not beneath Ruoxi's,

567
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:37,240
and I can chat about anything under the sun.

568
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,560
We can...

569
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:41,940
look out for each other, and do anything, even sacrifice oneself, for each other?

570
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:45,480
Sure, good bro,

571
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,460
I salute you.

572
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:51,180
My turn.

573
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:02,580
Good alcohol tolerance.

574
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:04,780
You're a good bro indeed.

575
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:09,780
All right, I'll be leaving now.

576
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:33,700
Crown Prince.

577
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:36,540
Stately and dignified, with an extraordinary aura.

578
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:37,980
It's really a good horse.

579
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:40,980
Taking this horse for a gallop

580
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:42,980
will get rid of my boredom for sure.

581
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:43,980
Crown Prince,

582
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:47,160
this is a tribute to His Majesty, you cannot ride it.

583
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:49,040
What do you mean by I can't ride it?

584
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:51,100
Gifts that are sent to Imperial Father...

585
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:53,420
you mean to say that even I, the Crown Prince, cannot ride it?

586
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:56,620
That's right. What the Crown Prince wants,

587
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:58,060
how can he not be allowed to have it?

588
00:30:58,060 --> 00:30:59,580
Your servant is afraid that His Majesty will blame me.

589
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:00,740
What audacity.

590
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:03,200
Don't you know the importance of the Crown Prince to His Majesty

591
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,460
To offend Crown Prince is to offend His Majesty!

592
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:12,060
Who knows? Imperial Father might have already planned to  gift this tribute horse to Crown Prince.

593
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:13,640
What Big Brother said is correct.

594
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:17,660
How could Imperial Father ever be mad at me?

595
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:19,060
Whatever it is,

596
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:20,880
I am definitely riding this horse today!

597
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:34,140
Your Majesty, please drink tea.

598
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:01,480
Emperor, forgive me to say this

599
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:02,500
Eighteenth Prince

600
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:03,940
is being well taken care of by the Imperial Physicians,

601
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:05,720
he will definitely make it through.

602
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:07,520
Your Majesty, don't worry too much.

603
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:09,980
Take care of your health. Your imperial body is of utmost importance.

604
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:34,300
Imperial Father! Imperial Father!

605
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:36,540
Imperial Father.

606
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:38,940
The Crown Prince has gotten himself into trouble.

607
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:44,500
Riding the tribute horse without permission,

608
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:46,780
not only is that disrespectful to Lord Guwalgiya,

609
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:48,340
it's also disrespectful to their people!

610
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:49,580
If I don't punish you severely,

611
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:51,260
it'll be hard to appease their anger.

612
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,000
Your Majesty,

613
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,720
I don't think he did it on purpose either.

614
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,340
He was probably being mischievous and wanted to play.

615
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:57,300
Playful?

616
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:59,320
Eighteenth Prince's life is hanging by a thread right now.

617
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:01,120
And you're still thinking of having fun?

618
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,640
Sparing no concern for your kin

619
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:03,860
is an even greater crime!

620
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:06,940
Regarding this incident,

621
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:09,040
I will not pursue it anymore,

622
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,660
in hopes that Eighteenth Prince

623
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:11,900
will recover soon.

624
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:13,500
Even if you don't pursue it,

625
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:15,800
I cannot sit here and pretend that nothing has happened.

626
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,060
This time,

627
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:19,660
I must punish the Crown Prince severely.

628
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:25,620
Let me go in! Let go of me!

629
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:26,660
Crown Prince!

630
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:29,460
Big Brother, the Crown Prince is drunk.

631
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:32,700
Fourth Brother, this matter has nothing to do with you.

632
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:36,100
You guys, scram!

633
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:37,220
Yes.

634
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:43,140
Big Brother, are you trying to get me killed?

635
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:45,580
That day, it was precisely because you egged me on,

636
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:47,880
that I dared to ride the tribute horse without permission,

637
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,880
and angered Imperial Father.

638
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,460
Your heart is filled with malicious intent.

639
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:52,900
Do you think I don't know?

640
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:55,360
All along,

641
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,860
you've continuously schemed

642
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:59,220
to take the position of Crown Prince from me!

643
00:33:59,220 --> 00:33:59,900
Crown Prince.

644
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:01,460
- If you have guts, admit it!
- Crown Prince.

645
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:05,860
How would I dare think of scheming to take the Crown Prince's position?

646
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,540
That is Imperial Father's edict.

647
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:09,620
Who would dare to hanker for it?

648
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:13,020
Even though it's true that I am more suitable to be Crown Prince than you.

649
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:15,380
What did you say?

650
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:18,000
When appointing the heir, appoint either the child of wife (not the consorts) or the eldest child.

651
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:20,500
You are the son borne by the Empress.

652
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:21,740
And I'm the eldest son.

653
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:23,380
I qualify as much as you do.

654
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:25,320
Big Brother, please do not spout nonsense.

655
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,019
I am not spouting nonsense.

656
00:34:27,019 --> 00:34:28,740
If not because Imperial Father favors him in particular...

657
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:30,820
he's worse than all the other princes.

658
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:33,539
In terms of capability, intelligence, and character,

659
00:34:33,539 --> 00:34:35,080
do you deserve to be Crown Prince?

660
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:35,920
Big Brother.

661
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:37,380
Even he (Fourth Prince) is more deserving than you.

662
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:42,139
I am the Empress's child.

663
00:34:42,139 --> 00:34:43,819
Who do you guys think you are?

664
00:34:43,819 --> 00:34:45,140
Let me tell you,

665
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:46,340
even if I am deposed,

666
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:47,300
you people won't be able to replace me!

667
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:49,340
Deposing you is something that is only a matter of time!

668
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:50,700
Crown Prince, don't be so worked up.

669
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:52,220
Songgotu* was found plotting rebellion,
(*Uncle of Kangxi's first Empress, the Crown Prince's granduncle)

670
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:53,980
and was stripped of all official titles by Imperial Father.

671
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:55,540
His head might roll any time.

672
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:57,760
Do you think you can leave yourself out of the matter and stay untouched?!

673
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:58,460
You!

674
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:00,020
Did you really only embezzle tributes,

675
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:01,099
and ride the tribute horse without permission?

676
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:03,820
Your incest with Father's concubines,

677
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:05,580
did you really think you were able to keep that a secret?

678
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:07,020
That Imperial Father really doesn't know about it?

679
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:08,300
Big Brother, you can't say that!

680
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:09,260
That's a capital crime!

681
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:10,340
That's his capital crime!

682
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:21,020
All of you are the same. All of you want me dead.

683
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:23,820
All of you want to be Crown Prince.

684
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:29,140
Fine. Fine.

685
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:32,220
We'll wait and see.

686
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:33,700
We'll see!

687
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:39,620
Let's see how long you can be arrogant for.

688
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:44,100
Fourth Brother, make yourself at home.

689
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:03,480
Who's there?

690
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:04,200
Me.

691
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,200
Crown Prince.

692
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,340
You don't even recognize me?

693
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:08,020
I want to see Imperial Father!

694
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:09,860
Crown Prince, His Majesty has ordered that

695
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:11,060
no one is to get close.

696
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:15,780
Got it.

697
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:55,220
Who's that?

698
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:57,820
Who's outside?

699
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:00,420
Who's outside? Take him down!

700
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:02,000
Stand still! Stand still!

701
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:10,500
Imperial Father.

702
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,420
Crown Prince, how come it's you?

703
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:13,180
Your Majesty,

704
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:15,020
I'd tried to stop the Crown Prince.

705
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:16,320
But he...

706
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:18,580
What were you planning to do

707
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:19,500
by lurking suspiciously outside?

708
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:22,700
Imperial Father,

709
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:24,700
You're not really going to

710
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:26,360
break off all ties with me, are you?

711
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,540
Li Dequan!

712
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:28,540
Your Majesty.

713
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:30,140
Imperial Father, don't!

714
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:32,040
Imperial Father! Imperial Father!

715
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:33,280
You can't depose me!

716
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,060
Imperial Father!

717
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:35,280
I am the Crown Prince.

718
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:37,060
I am the Great Qing Dynasty Crown Prince.

719
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:38,480
You mustn't depose me!

720
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:41,000
Shut up! Shut up for me.

721
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,620
I am the Crown Prince.

722
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:44,980
The Crown Prince who you'd personally bestowed the title on.

723
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:46,940
The Crown Prince that you'd personally raised.

724
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:48,620
You can't depose me!

725
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:49,660
Get out!

726
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:51,780
Imperial Father!

727
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:54,340
I am the Crown Prince that was personally raised by you.

728
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:56,000
The Crown Prince who you'd personally bestowed the title on.

729
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,380
- You cannot depose me just like that!
- Drag him out of here!

730
00:37:58,380 --> 00:37:59,980
- Imperial Father.
- Yes.
- Imperial Father!

731
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:01,860
Imperial Father, you can't depose me!

732
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:03,740
Imperial Father. Imperial Father!

733
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:05,100
Imperial Father!

734
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:05,820
Imperial Father!

735
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:07,660
I am the future master of the Great Qing Empire!

736
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:09,140
- Go!
- You can't depose me!

737
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:11,820
Imperial Father! Imperial Father! Imperial Father!

738
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:13,060
Li Dequan!

739
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:14,180
Your Majesty.

740
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:15,620
Send out my order.

741
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:18,420
Without my permission,

742
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:20,100
the Crown Prince is not allowed

743
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:22,740
- to come near my tent again.
- Yes.

744
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:34,500
If I'm not wrong,

745
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:36,660
the date when Kangxi deposes the Crown Prince

746
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:37,660
isn't too far off anymore.

747
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:36,800
Looks like Eighteenth Prince

748
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,400
has really passed away.

749
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:43,680
All of you leave.

750
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:44,800
Yes.

751
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:58,740
All of you are dismissed.

752
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,580
Although His Majesty has dismissed us,

753
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:12,260
someone still needs to be nearby tonight to await orders.

754
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:13,240
Tonight,

755
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:15,140
let me and Yutan stand by the door and keep watch.

756
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:19,100
The rest of you can go back and rest.

757
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:21,120
Come back early tomorrow morning to await your orders.

758
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:22,460
- Yes.
- Yes.

759
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:32,220
Ruoxi Jiejie,

760
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:33,860
what should we do with these princes?

761
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:35,860
They can't possibly stand here all night, can they?

762
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:37,060
If something happens to their health,

763
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:39,420
even if I had ten heads, I wouldn't be able to bear responsibility for it all.

764
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:42,540
I'm afraid that it's impossible

765
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:44,220
to go in and announce them now.

766
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:46,700
Why not tell them to leave first,

767
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:49,780
and get people to summon them if anything crops up?

768
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:53,220
But tell the eunuchs on duty

769
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:55,020
to give them news on the sly,

770
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:56,940
so that they will be more alert tonight,

771
00:40:56,940 --> 00:40:58,660
in case the Emperor wants to see them.

772
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:04,060
Yutan, wait here for a while,

773
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:05,340
I'll go get some soothing tea..

774
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:06,260
Yes.

775
00:41:10,580 --> 00:41:12,940
Your Highnesses, the Emperor is already resting.

776
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:14,660
Why don't you return first,

777
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:16,540
and I'll let you know if anything happens?

778
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:18,460
You're right.

779
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:20,820
Fourth Brother, why don't we return first?

780
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:22,300
Tomorrow, Father

781
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:23,220
will still need someone to wait on him.

782
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:47,940
Greetings to Fourth Prince.

783
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:49,740
Excused.

784
00:41:55,620 --> 00:41:57,020
Do you have any instructions, Fourth Prince?

785
00:41:58,660 --> 00:42:00,140
Ruoxi,

786
00:42:00,820 --> 00:42:02,880
find a chance to comfort Imperial Father on my behalf.

787
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:06,500
After all, experiencing the death of a son

788
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:09,020
will cause heartbreak, even for someone as strong as an emperor.

789
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:12,780
He once said that you're almost like a daughter.

790
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:14,580
It'd be best if you could comfort him.

791
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:17,300
I understand.

792
00:42:38,060 --> 00:42:41,400
Your Majesty, this is soothing tea.

793
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:43,120
Please have some.

794
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:44,700
I don't want to drink.

795
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:51,120
Your Majesty, Eighteenth Prince

796
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:54,100
has always been an intelligent and obedient child.

797
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:56,100
He's a good child.

798
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:58,340
That's why the heavens wanted him back.

799
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:02,620
Amongst my many children,

800
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:06,900
Eighteenth Prince was the most intelligent.

801
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:11,380
He was as handsome as the Crown Prince,

802
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:15,020
and he was the closest to me.

803
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:19,660
He would often copy books and paintings

804
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:21,620
to cheer me up.

805
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:25,340
He brought me endless comfort.

806
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:27,680
To have had Your Majesty's love and concern,

807
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:28,940
it can be said that Eighteenth Prince

808
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:30,660
has no regrets.

809
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:36,380
Amongst my many children,

810
00:43:37,580 --> 00:43:39,540
those that are as close to me as he was

811
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:42,180
are not many.

812
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:44,980
They're all my children.

813
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:50,700
The Crown Prince was personally brought up by me.

814
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:56,020
When he was four, he was well versed in the Four Books and Five Classics.

815
00:43:56,020 --> 00:43:59,180
When he was 11, he could speak Manchurian, Mandarin and Mongolian fluently.

816
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:03,080
He is my blood,

817
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:04,760
and is the closest to me.

818
00:44:06,740 --> 00:44:09,380
A pity that as he slowly grows older,

819
00:44:10,620 --> 00:44:12,260
he becomes more and more...

820
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:20,540
The Crown Prince's mother

821
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:21,980
unfortunately passed away

822
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:24,140
after his birth,

823
00:44:25,060 --> 00:44:26,900
making the Crown Prince motherless.

824
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:31,940
I could only dote on him more.

825
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:35,460
It was also the only thing that

826
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:38,980
I could do for the late Empress.

827
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:53,260
Your servant greets the Crown Prince.

828
00:44:53,260 --> 00:44:54,820
I am here to wait upon Imperial Father.

829
00:44:56,300 --> 00:44:57,220
Crown Prince,

830
00:44:57,220 --> 00:44:59,140
the Emperor is already resting.

831
00:44:59,140 --> 00:45:00,220
What about Li Dequan?

832
00:45:00,220 --> 00:45:02,820
My master is waiting on the Emperor.

833
00:45:02,820 --> 00:45:05,140
I'm afraid he's not free now.

834
00:45:05,140 --> 00:45:06,780
Since he is already resting,

835
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:09,900
ask your master to come out to speak with me. Is that so difficult?

836
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:10,900
Crown Prince,

837
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:12,340
your servant does not mean it that way.

838
00:45:12,340 --> 00:45:14,100
I'm afraid that you will alarm the Emperor.

839
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:15,260
- Crown Prince.
- Move!

840
00:45:15,260 --> 00:45:16,340
-Crown Prince
-Leave!

841
00:45:16,340 --> 00:45:17,260
- Crown Prince!
- Scram!

842
00:45:17,260 --> 00:45:18,660
Open the door!

843
00:45:20,340 --> 00:45:21,700
What audacity!

844
00:45:37,660 --> 00:45:39,700
The Crown Prince is unrepentant.

845
00:45:40,820 --> 00:45:42,740
He has no respect for the law or propriety.

846
00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:46,380
I have condoned him for twenty odd years,

847
00:45:47,580 --> 00:45:50,440
but not only is he unrepentant,

848
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:53,400
he is getting worse by the day,

849
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:56,280
it would be difficult for him to take on the mantle of our forefathers.

850
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:58,460
Please reconsider, Your Majesty.

851
00:45:58,460 --> 00:46:00,640
The Crown Prince is unqualified,

852
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:04,580
he does not listen to my teachings, and acts out repeatedly.

853
00:46:04,580 --> 00:46:05,860
He holds no esteem for anyone.

854
00:46:06,940 --> 00:46:08,260
In my 29th year of reign,

855
00:46:08,260 --> 00:46:09,860
when I personally led the army to conquer Geerdan,

856
00:46:09,860 --> 00:46:12,660
I fell sick midway and missed the Crown Prince,

857
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:14,900
so I specially summoned him to my side to look after me.

858
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:17,660
At that time, I already saw that the Crown Prince

859
00:46:17,660 --> 00:46:19,580
had no loyalty to his king nor love for his father.

860
00:46:20,540 --> 00:46:22,580
Now that the Eighteenth Prince has passed away,

861
00:46:24,020 --> 00:46:26,020
all have been worried for me

862
00:46:26,020 --> 00:46:28,300
due to my advanced age.

863
00:46:29,180 --> 00:46:32,220
But you, only you.

864
00:46:33,140 --> 00:46:34,380
Only you, who are his blood brother,

865
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:37,020
showed no signs of love or compassion.

866
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:39,980
You have caused me great grief and distress.

867
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:43,780
The Crown Prince recklessly took from the state treasury,

868
00:46:43,780 --> 00:46:45,320
and interfered with state affairs.

869
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:46,940
His transgressions are countless.

870
00:46:48,340 --> 00:46:51,500
I had hoped that he would turn over a new leaf,

871
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:54,840
which is why I condoned and bore it till today.

872
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:58,420
But the Crown Prince remains unrepentant!

873
00:46:58,420 --> 00:47:00,580
He covets my throne.

874
00:47:00,580 --> 00:47:02,120
Such a person,

875
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:04,520
if he were to take on the mantle of a ruler,

876
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:06,640
would only ruin our country.

877
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:08,300
Ruin the people.

878
00:47:09,380 --> 00:47:10,980
I will not

879
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:14,420
tolerate an unfilial and nonbenevolent person to become Emperor.

880
00:47:14,420 --> 00:47:18,880
I declare to the world and to the heavens

881
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:22,340
to depose the Crown Prince.

882
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:27,460
Imperial Father!

883
00:47:27,460 --> 00:47:28,980
Your Majesty! Are you all right?

884
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:31,380
- Send for the Imperial Physician.
- Hurry!
-Imperial Father!

885
00:47:35,450 --> 00:47:40,390
♫  Stopping here, afraid to go any further ♫

886
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:46,860

♫  That paradise is the place where I’d loved you  ♫
