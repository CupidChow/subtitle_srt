Scarlet Heart
Episode 7

3
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:07,900
I have investigated and verified

4
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:10,392
the incident involving the Crown Prince improperly using tributes.

5
00:02:10,392 --> 00:02:12,157
It was certain devious persons seeking to curry favor

6
00:02:12,157 --> 00:02:13,829
who falsely used the Crown Prince's name

7
00:02:13,829 --> 00:02:16,600
to fool everyone and commit all kinds of atrocities.

8
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,930
All the people involved

9
00:02:18,326 --> 00:02:20,733
will be arrested by Ministry of Justice.

10
00:02:20,733 --> 00:02:22,667
Thank you, Imperial Father, for finding out the truth

11
00:02:22,667 --> 00:02:24,700
and returning me my innocence.

12
00:02:25,267 --> 00:02:28,936
Crown Prince, although this matter wasn't directly caused by you,

13
00:02:28,936 --> 00:02:30,800
you still have an unshrinkable responsibility.

14
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,600
You didn't properly take charge of your subordinates,

15
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,880
allowing them to do as they pleased and you shouldn't have done that.

16
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,533
As the saying goes, "Know people's strong suits and use them to the best of their strengths".

17
00:02:37,533 --> 00:02:39,038
That is the right way to rule a country.

18
00:02:39,038 --> 00:02:41,242
I will bear Imperial Father's teachings in mind.

19
00:02:41,242 --> 00:02:44,000
From now on, I will definitely pay more attention.

20
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,447
The words Imperial Father just said,

21
00:02:45,447 --> 00:02:47,558
"Know people's strong suits and use them to the best of their strengths"

22
00:02:47,558 --> 00:02:49,233
made me suddenly realize something.

23
00:02:49,233 --> 00:02:50,700
What did you realize?

24
00:02:51,767 --> 00:02:55,174
This time, the officials who dared to file a complaint against me,

25
00:02:55,174 --> 00:02:56,568
I reckon

26
00:02:56,568 --> 00:02:58,704
that they are all very courageous

27
00:02:58,704 --> 00:03:00,433
and righteous.

28
00:03:00,433 --> 00:03:02,700
Loyal officials who will not bend their morals in the face of pressure from higher-ups.

29
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:05,667
They truly are the backbone of our Qing Empire,

30
00:03:05,667 --> 00:03:08,900
by right, they should be rewarded,

31
00:03:09,803 --> 00:03:11,733
especially Tenth Brother.

32
00:03:16,276 --> 00:03:18,441
The South Sea is deep and wide

33
00:03:18,441 --> 00:03:20,716
because it humbly accepts every creek and stream.

34
00:03:20,716 --> 00:03:22,435
Though the Mount of Wu'yue is mighty in size

35
00:03:22,435 --> 00:03:24,339
it doesn't forsake even a grain of dirt.

36
00:03:24,339 --> 00:03:26,867
For the Crown Prince to have such an open mind

37
00:03:26,867 --> 00:03:29,772
is the fortune of the Qing Empire and its people.

38
00:03:30,767 --> 00:03:32,333
I will allow it.

39
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:35,700
All court officials who reported this will rise one grade in  rank and

40
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:39,500
Tenth Prince's official salary will be increased by 1,000 taels.

41
00:03:41,833 --> 00:03:44,033
Thank you, Imperial Father.

42
00:03:44,033 --> 00:03:45,492
Thank you, Imperial Father

43
00:03:46,333 --> 00:03:49,500
Imperial Father, I've reflected a lot about my painful experience.

44
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,067
In this incident involving tributes,

45
00:03:51,067 --> 00:03:52,551
I have thought it over repeatedly.

46
00:03:52,551 --> 00:03:55,000
Other than those areas in which I underperformed,

47
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,056
what other reasons could there be that caused others to misunderstand me

48
00:03:58,056 --> 00:04:02,133
and believe that I would deceive Your Majesty and commit such a traitorous act.

49
00:04:02,133 --> 00:04:03,536
Then, what have you come up with?

50
00:04:03,536 --> 00:04:05,300
The reason could be

51
00:04:05,619 --> 00:04:09,919
a lack of communication between the princes and having such  a distant relationship with each other,

52
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:12,288
causes us to have misunderstandings about each other,

53
00:04:12,288 --> 00:04:14,300
resulting in such things happening.

54
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:16,867
It truly is a pity.

55
00:04:16,867 --> 00:04:18,700
For brothers to be at odds with each other

56
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:21,267
is not something that all parents would be happy to see.

57
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:26,333
Therefore, to strengthen the relationship between the princes,

58
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:29,564
I beseech Imperial Father

59
00:04:29,564 --> 00:04:35,767
to allow all the princes to join Imperial Father on the hunting expedition this year.

60
00:04:38,533 --> 00:04:41,767
Crown Prince, what you just said coincides with my intentions.

61
00:04:41,767 --> 00:04:45,307
As they say, only when people unite and work together, will they be able to overcome difficulties.

62
00:04:45,307 --> 00:04:48,667
All of you princes must bear that in mind.

63
00:04:48,667 --> 00:04:50,900
We understand.

64
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:56,499
Then these matters of the rewards and the hunting expedition will be organized by the Crown Prince.

65
00:04:56,499 --> 00:04:57,400
Fourth Prince,

66
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,000
you're in charge of helping.

67
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,733
Yes.

68
00:05:04,769 --> 00:05:05,765
Fourth Brother,

69
00:05:05,765 --> 00:05:08,467
did you see how happy Imperial Father was earlier?

70
00:05:08,467 --> 00:05:09,367
Fourth Brother,

71
00:05:09,367 --> 00:05:10,967
when you said Imperial Father wouldn't punish me

72
00:05:10,967 --> 00:05:12,467
I didn't dare believe it at all.

73
00:05:12,467 --> 00:05:14,767
I thought it was just something Fourth Brother was saying to comfort me.

74
00:05:14,767 --> 00:05:15,633
Who'd have thought

75
00:05:15,633 --> 00:05:18,667
that Fourth Brother would be even better than me at guessing Imperial Father's thoughts.

76
00:05:18,667 --> 00:05:20,300
Imperial Father has always been magnanimous,

77
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:22,533
especially towards Crown Prince.

78
00:05:22,533 --> 00:05:25,333
If Imperial Father was not impressed by you,

79
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:27,600
he would never have let you inherit the throne.

80
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,700
You said it well.

81
00:05:30,367 --> 00:05:32,133
Today's battle,

82
00:05:32,133 --> 00:05:35,333
if you hadn't been my adviser,

83
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:38,567
I would have had no confidence at all in turning the tide,

84
00:05:38,567 --> 00:05:39,967
and even win so beautifully,

85
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:42,600
making Eighth Brother and his gang suffer such a big defeat.

86
00:05:43,333 --> 00:05:44,867
Crown Prince is exaggerating.

87
00:05:44,867 --> 00:05:47,733
I just want to help Crown Prince and Imperial Father solve your problems,

88
00:05:47,733 --> 00:05:49,333
and not make a mountain out of a molehill,

89
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:51,467
and adversely affect everyone's relationships.

90
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,367
Fourth Brother,

91
00:05:55,033 --> 00:05:57,533
you care about our brotherly relationship,

92
00:05:57,533 --> 00:06:00,467
but Eighth Brother and his gang

93
00:06:00,467 --> 00:06:02,400
are totally different from you.

94
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:07,133
I believe this matter

95
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:08,933
has nothing at all to do with Eighth Brother.

96
00:06:08,933 --> 00:06:11,633
It's all because Tenth Brother falsely believed the rumors.

97
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:13,600
Crown Prince knows clearly as well,

98
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,033
that Tenth Brother has always been impetuous,

99
00:06:15,033 --> 00:06:16,770
and never thinks things through thoroughly.

100
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:17,900
Fourth Brother,

101
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,233
sometimes,

102
00:06:19,233 --> 00:06:22,033
you think too kindly of others.

103
00:06:23,267 --> 00:06:25,600
You should always treat others with caution (Chinese idiom).

104
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,100
If someone sold you off,

105
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:30,702
don't tell me, you'd still go to help the person who sold you, count the money?

106
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:35,467
I don't think

107
00:06:35,467 --> 00:06:37,733
this matter is so simple.

108
00:06:37,733 --> 00:06:41,067
I think Imperial Father also thinks this way as well.

109
00:06:42,498 --> 00:06:44,533
Why does the Crown Prince say so?

110
00:06:45,233 --> 00:06:47,667
As to how involved I am in the incident involving the tributes,

111
00:06:47,667 --> 00:06:50,133
do you think Imperial Father doesn't know about it?

112
00:06:50,133 --> 00:06:52,633
Today, Imperial Father did not punish me.

113
00:06:53,133 --> 00:06:55,233
Why do you think that happened?

114
00:06:55,967 --> 00:06:57,700
Why?

115
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:00,267
Other than what you've just said,

116
00:07:00,267 --> 00:07:04,133
Imperial Father just wants to remind everyone,

117
00:07:04,133 --> 00:07:06,667
especially Eighth Brother and his gang.

118
00:07:07,233 --> 00:07:08,600
He wants to tell them

119
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:12,233
who is the future ruler of the great Qing Empire!

120
00:07:14,367 --> 00:07:15,667
Actually Imperial Father

121
00:07:15,667 --> 00:07:17,833
wants to use this chance today

122
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:20,600
to tell everyone a clear-cut fact and

123
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,967
that is to warn them

124
00:07:21,967 --> 00:07:24,233
that it's best for them to know their place.

125
00:07:25,467 --> 00:07:27,568
Even if I don't take revenge

126
00:07:27,568 --> 00:07:30,167
for what happened today,

127
00:07:30,167 --> 00:07:33,033
I still need to teach them a lesson.

128
00:07:34,325 --> 00:07:35,300
Fourth Brother,

129
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:37,367
do you have any good ideas?

130
00:07:47,569 --> 00:07:50,567
At the time when Imperial Father and Crown Prince are out  of the capital,

131
00:07:50,567 --> 00:07:52,467
Crown Prince has suggested to Imperial Father

132
00:07:52,467 --> 00:07:55,100
to let me supervise temporarily.

133
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,972
Looks like Crown Prince is starting to trust Eighth Brother!

134
00:07:57,972 --> 00:07:59,267
Tenth Brother!

135
00:07:59,267 --> 00:08:02,133
What in the world is your brain filled with?

136
00:08:02,133 --> 00:08:04,667
Have you forgotten your relationship with Eighth Brother?

137
00:08:04,967 --> 00:08:07,033
You just impeached him in front of Imperial Father.

138
00:08:07,033 --> 00:08:09,567
Do you think the Crown Prince would be that magnanimous?

139
00:08:09,567 --> 00:08:12,300
I... Thats what I don't understand.

140
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:16,376
In my opinion, this is just the Crown Prince's attempt to hit two birds with one stone

141
00:08:16,376 --> 00:08:18,267
and deal with us.

142
00:08:18,267 --> 00:08:20,167
What does that mean?

143
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,233
Asking Eighth Brother to temporarily supervise the country

144
00:08:22,233 --> 00:08:23,933
is only a trick.

145
00:08:23,933 --> 00:08:25,300
No matter how trivial an issue seems,

146
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:28,900
Eighth Brother will always have to defer to Imperial Father, who is far away, beyond the Great Wall, for instructions.

147
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:30,600
Once Eighth Brother makes a mistake of any sort,

148
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,467
it will allow the Crown Prince to hold it against him

149
00:08:32,467 --> 00:08:34,167
and make a fuss about it.

150
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:37,167
He purposely gave Eighth Brother this rubber stamp.

151
00:08:37,167 --> 00:08:38,200
so as to

152
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,900
not let us tag along on the expedition outside the Great Wall.

153
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:41,167
That way, they'll be able to spread

154
00:08:41,167 --> 00:08:43,433
all sorts of rumors in front of Imperial Father.

155
00:08:43,433 --> 00:08:44,567
Oh yes!

156
00:08:44,567 --> 00:08:46,841
If you repeat a lie thrice, it becomes the truth.

157
00:08:46,841 --> 00:08:48,400
We're not allowed to accompany Imperial Father,

158
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,867
and it also lets us understand the difference in close and distant relationships.

159
00:08:50,867 --> 00:08:53,267
All we can do is just watch then.

160
00:08:53,267 --> 00:08:56,367
I reckon, this is also a hint from the Crown Prince

161
00:08:56,367 --> 00:08:57,700
that if we continue not to listen to him,

162
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:59,900
he will deal with us.

163
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:02,333
What Imperial Father values the most

164
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:04,833
has always been whether or not the relationship between us brothers is harmonious.

165
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:07,467
That the Crown Prince was magnanimous despite any former animosity,

166
00:09:07,467 --> 00:09:09,900
is exactly what Imperial Father hopes for.

167
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,033
He's got a trick up his sleeve,

168
00:09:11,033 --> 00:09:12,933
but so do we!

169
00:09:12,933 --> 00:09:14,633
Come that time, when the Emperor is far away (and won't be able to have much control),

170
00:09:14,633 --> 00:09:15,733
the capital will be ours.

171
00:09:15,733 --> 00:09:17,333
We can do as we please!

172
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:18,600
Shut up!

173
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,533
I...

174
00:09:19,533 --> 00:09:21,438
Did I say something wrong again?

175
00:09:21,438 --> 00:09:23,000
Crown Prince wants us to do just that.

176
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,933
That way, it's easy for us to make mistakes.

177
00:09:33,267 --> 00:09:36,667
This trick of Crown Prince is too vicious!

178
00:09:37,267 --> 00:09:40,600
The vicious one isn't the Crown Prince.

179
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:43,267
Then... Then who is it?

180
00:09:59,867 --> 00:10:01,133
Jiejie,

181
00:10:01,133 --> 00:10:02,833
this tea set is so intricate,

182
00:10:02,833 --> 00:10:05,300
did you design it on your own?

183
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:07,600
If not for Eunuch Li's help in finding people to make it,

184
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,967
this tea set couldn't have been created either.

185
00:10:09,967 --> 00:10:12,100
This time, when His Majesty and the princes go on the expedition,

186
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,933
they will definitely be happy

187
00:10:13,933 --> 00:10:15,500
to use Jiejie's tea set to drink their tea.

188
00:10:16,748 --> 00:10:19,900
Jiejie, do you want to go with everyone on the expedition?

189
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:21,500
Don't you want to go?

190
00:10:23,733 --> 00:10:25,100
If I think about the beautiful scenery outside the Great Wall

191
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,700
and the cool, refreshing weather,

192
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,233
of course, I would want to go too.

193
00:10:28,233 --> 00:10:29,400
Go then!

194
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,600
Jiejie still has to use this tea set to serve tea,

195
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,433
otherwise, wouldn't it be such a pity?

196
00:10:33,433 --> 00:10:34,433
Yes.

197
00:10:34,433 --> 00:10:35,800
It isn't that much of a pity.

198
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,567
As long as the person using the tea set is happy,

199
00:10:37,567 --> 00:10:39,100
then it's enough.

200
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:41,333
Why don't we go ask Eunuch Li?

201
00:10:41,667 --> 00:10:44,167
I was just pondering on how to ask Eunuch Li

202
00:10:44,167 --> 00:10:45,467
so that he will let us go.

203
00:10:45,467 --> 00:10:47,667
Ruoxi Jiejie!

204
00:10:47,667 --> 00:10:49,500
Ruoxi Jiejie.

205
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,433
Good news!

206
00:10:50,433 --> 00:10:52,167
Teacher said Jiejie can go along on the expedition.

207
00:10:52,167 --> 00:10:52,800
Really?

208
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,600
Of course!

209
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,267
Then what about us?

210
00:10:54,267 --> 00:10:55,667
You guys will go along with Jiejie!

211
00:10:55,667 --> 00:10:56,633
Wonderful!

212
00:10:56,633 --> 00:10:58,033
Eunuch Li is such an empathetic person.

213
00:10:58,033 --> 00:10:59,333
He takes care of us well!

214
00:10:59,333 --> 00:11:00,867
This is not because of Teacher.

215
00:11:00,867 --> 00:11:02,667
I heard that it was suggested by a Prince,

216
00:11:02,667 --> 00:11:04,033
and His Majesty did not object.

217
00:11:04,033 --> 00:11:06,333
Prince? Which prince?

218
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:09,033
Seems like it was Fourth Prince and Thirteenth Prince.

219
00:11:11,567 --> 00:11:13,700
Fourth Prince wouldn't bother about a matter like this

220
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:15,400
It must be Thirteenth Prince.

221
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:19,000
Thirteenth Prince truly knows me the best.

222
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,067
No need to bother about that, Jiejie.

223
00:11:20,067 --> 00:11:22,367
It's so great that we can go together!

224
00:11:23,067 --> 00:11:26,467
Of course, we must also thank Eunuch Wangxi.

225
00:11:26,467 --> 00:11:28,533
Your servant doesn't dare (take credit for this).

226
00:11:28,533 --> 00:11:30,267
Your servant will take his leave.

227
00:12:00,867 --> 00:12:02,467
Ruoxi!

228
00:12:10,233 --> 00:12:12,867
Greetings to Fourth Prince, greetings to Thirteenth Prince.

229
00:12:14,167 --> 00:12:15,500
Rise.

230
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:18,933
The moment you see me, you always try to hide.

231
00:12:20,033 --> 00:12:21,500
Your servant wouldn't dare.

232
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,867
My whole mind was focused on thinking

233
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:25,167
which flower suits which tea,

234
00:12:25,167 --> 00:12:26,733
and didn't see Fourth Prince,

235
00:12:26,733 --> 00:12:28,700
I didn't mean to avoid you on purpose.

236
00:12:30,008 --> 00:12:33,700
Do you know what the consequence of lying to a prince is?

237
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,300
Your servant did not lie.

238
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:36,267
Ruoxi,

239
00:12:36,267 --> 00:12:38,167
I don't know what the consequence of it is either.

240
00:12:38,167 --> 00:12:39,867
Why don't you try?

241
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,867
Fourth Brother, I think...

242
00:12:44,867 --> 00:12:47,533
it's best that you don't play these jokes on her in future.

243
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:48,800
You look too imposing like that,

244
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,967
she'll be scared before she can even laugh.

245
00:12:54,733 --> 00:12:56,767
Ruoxi, do you know?

246
00:12:56,767 --> 00:12:59,333
This time, it was because Fourth Brother proposed it,

247
00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:00,900
and me putting in good words for you,

248
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:03,300
that you got the chance to go along.

249
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:05,333
It's fine even if you don't repay our kindness,

250
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:07,533
but you still pretend that we don't exist.

251
00:13:07,533 --> 00:13:09,700
No wonder Fourth Brother wants to teach you a lesson.

252
00:13:10,667 --> 00:13:13,767
Your servant has long been grateful for Fourth Prince's help,

253
00:13:13,767 --> 00:13:15,967
it's just that I've been having trouble finding a chance to repay it.

254
00:13:15,967 --> 00:13:17,333
Is that so?

255
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:19,967
Yes, if there is a chance,

256
00:13:19,967 --> 00:13:22,200
your servant will definitely repay your kindness.

257
00:13:27,233 --> 00:13:29,367
If you have no further instructions,

258
00:13:29,367 --> 00:13:31,233
I shall take my leave first.

259
00:13:31,967 --> 00:13:33,167
Slow down.

260
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,733
The expedition is different from the palace,

261
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:39,267
the things there cannot be compared to those in the palace,

262
00:13:39,267 --> 00:13:41,133
and you cannot replace things immediately.

263
00:13:41,133 --> 00:13:43,067
So you have to be more careful.

264
00:13:43,067 --> 00:13:44,967
Bring more of the tea leaves you need.

265
00:13:44,967 --> 00:13:48,433
Place it in two carts in case anything goes wrong.

266
00:13:49,733 --> 00:13:50,900
Your servant understands.

267
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:52,300
Go and prepare then.

268
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:53,900
Your servant takes her leave.

269
00:14:00,767 --> 00:14:02,700
Fourth Brother, since when did you start to

270
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:05,500
bother about such trivial matters, like tea leaves?

271
00:14:06,067 --> 00:14:07,833
As long as it is part of my duties,

272
00:14:07,833 --> 00:14:09,433
I can't afford to be careless.

273
00:14:11,033 --> 00:14:12,567
Go and find Eighth Brother later

274
00:14:12,567 --> 00:14:14,333
and see if there's anything he needs.

275
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:15,800
It's best to take care of it for him also

276
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,600
before we leave.

277
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,433
It's not so easy to supervise a country.

278
00:14:19,433 --> 00:14:20,867
As long as it's within the limits of our capability,

279
00:14:20,867 --> 00:14:22,433
we should do our best to help him.

280
00:14:22,433 --> 00:14:24,500
We cannot let things go wrong.

281
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,000
I understand.

282
00:14:39,867 --> 00:14:41,367
Come in.

283
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,733
Come in!

284
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,667
Greetings to Eighth Prince.

285
00:15:03,667 --> 00:15:04,967
Dispense with ceremony.

286
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:08,067
It's the first time I've visited the place where you live.

287
00:15:08,067 --> 00:15:09,500
It's rather peaceful and quiet.

288
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,767
Right now, I am the head officer lady after all.

289
00:15:11,767 --> 00:15:14,767
The place where I live can't be too shabby, and make myself suffer.

290
00:15:17,467 --> 00:15:19,667
There's only Yutan and I who stay in this courtyard.

291
00:15:19,667 --> 00:15:20,667
It's her shift today.

292
00:15:20,667 --> 00:15:22,467
I know.

293
00:15:24,467 --> 00:15:25,533
Ruoxi,

294
00:15:25,533 --> 00:15:27,467
why did you tell him that?

295
00:15:27,467 --> 00:15:29,267
Are you hinting at something?

296
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,700
Ruoxi.

297
00:15:55,767 --> 00:15:57,400
What is it?

298
00:15:57,967 --> 00:15:59,833
For the hunting expedition this time,

299
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:01,533
I have to stay in the capital.

300
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:03,633
I know.

301
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:07,133
This is the first time you're going,

302
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:09,200
and for such a long journey.

303
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,867
Be careful.

304
00:16:10,867 --> 00:16:12,233
Don't worry.

305
00:16:12,233 --> 00:16:14,433
I've already been in the palace for a while,

306
00:16:14,433 --> 00:16:15,733
I'm no longer the Ruoxi who

307
00:16:15,733 --> 00:16:17,700
just entered the palace and didn't know anything.

308
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:19,933
What I can do and what I can't,

309
00:16:19,933 --> 00:16:21,733
I already know.

310
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,320
These couple of years,

311
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,840
you did better than I thought you would've.

312
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,880
I never thought

313
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,760
that Imperial Father and Li Dequan

314
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,200
would value you so.

315
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,360
But I still worry

316
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,080
that who knows, one day,

317
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,480
you'll lose your temper again.

318
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,760
You need to give something,

319
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:44,080
only then will you be able to gain more for yourself.

320
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:46,440
Otherwise,

321
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,400
it wouldn't be possible for me to live here,

322
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,160
and it'd be even more impossible for me to peacefully

323
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,480
stand here and talk to you.

324
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,560
To gain something,

325
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,040
you must first give something.

326
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,080
Master!

327
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,400
Master.

328
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:08,760
Yes.

329
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:16,480
I have to leave now.

330
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,700
What do you want most?

331
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:35,860
And what are you willing to give up for it?

332
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,320
Fujin!

333
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,040
Beile, you're back.

334
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,320
Beile. Beile!

335
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,680
You haven't come over to my place in a long time already.

336
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:23,120
Beile, Beile, Beile!

337
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,000
What must I do for you to forgive me?

338
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:27,880
Beile,

339
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:30,360
please forgive me this time, won't you?

340
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,680
Let go.

341
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,840
Beile,

342
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,480
from now on, I'll do everything you ask me to do.

343
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:39,480
I definitely won't do anything that will make you unhappy again.

344
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,240
What happened?

345
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,600
Nothing.

346
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,320
You tell me.

347
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:54,760
Hurry and tell me!

348
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,040
In this period that Beile didn't come over,

349
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:01,520
Difujin would listlessly hope for Beile to come.

350
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,080
And every day,

351
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:04,880
she'd personally make soup for Beile,

352
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,800
hoping that Beile will be able to drink it when he came over.

353
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:09,320
This injury was when she was making soup

354
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:10,880
and accidentally burned herself.

355
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,480
Does it still hurt?

356
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,320
No.

357
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,040
Can you forgive me?

358
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:46,920
It has already passed.

359
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,520
I've finally got what I've waited for.

360
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:08,720
I've waited for these words from you for so long,

361
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,720
and had such a hard time waiting.

362
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:17,040
I was afraid that Beile would ignore me forever.

363
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,680
I know I'm wrong.

364
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,960
I shouldn't be selfish,

365
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,440
shouldn't be petty.

366
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,720
But I love Beile with all my heart and soul,

367
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:35,320
I can't be without Beile.

368
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,040
Since Beile reprimanded me,

369
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,560
I've repented repeatedly.

370
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:52,560
During the period Beile ignored me,

371
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,280
I was in living hell.

372
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,280
I don't hate you.

373
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,320
Don't imagine things.

374
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,040
As long as Beile is willing to forgive me,

375
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,520
and not ignore me,

376
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,400
I am willing to do anything you want.

377
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,520
Even if your heart

378
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,720
doesn't entirely belong to me anymore,

379
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,960
I won't mind anymore.

380
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,040
I am willing to do anything for Beile.

381
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:39,480
What you've done is already enough.

382
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:43,160
No, I didn't do well enough.

383
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,600
I know.

384
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:47,000
I'll change. I will change again

385
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:50,600
so that Beile will not have any worries to hold him back.

386
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:54,960
With you looking after this family, I am very reassured.

387
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:58,200
The things you've done for me,

388
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,560
I know.

389
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:03,280
Today, you are my Difujin,

390
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,320
and you will be forever.

391
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,760
No one can replace you

392
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,920
Ruoxi, what are you thinking about?

393
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,920
Thirteenth Prince,

394
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,520
how long until we get there?

395
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,640
Not far.

396
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:03,080
This place is great. The scenery is beautiful.

397
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,520
What's so good about this place?

398
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:06,800
If I tell you,

399
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,640
in the future not a blade of grass will grow here

400
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,120
and it'll become a desert,

401
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:11,600
what will you think?

402
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,560
This place looks just fine.

403
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:14,760
Why would it suddenly become a desert?

404
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,000
Because of human ignorance

405
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,280
and selfish greed.

406
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,840
Aren't you too pessimistic?

407
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:27,040
I think, is it because you're exhausted from being on the road these past two days,

408
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,880
that you're starting to imagine things again?

409
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,600
Thirteenth Prince, why don't you teach me to ride horses?

410
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:37,320
Why do you suddenly change the topic?

411
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,920
I feel that to be able to ride horses

412
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,240
and gallop freely,

413
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,480
is another joyous thing.

414
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,320
Because I couldn't ride the last time,

415
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,420
I'm still being laughed at by Tenth Prince up to now.

416
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:47,960
Forget it.

417
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,080
You are currently

418
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,840
a favorite of Imperial Father.

419
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,080
Who would dare teach you?

420
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,000
If you fall and get injured,

421
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,040
I won't be able to account for it to Imperial Father.

422
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:58,320
Don't try this tactic on me.

423
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,800
You don't try this tactic on me.

424
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,160
I don't care.

425
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,340
(I'm taking it that) you promised!

426
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:06,700
Let's talk about it when we get to the plains.

427
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:08,400
I'm leaving! See you at the plains!

428
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:23,960
Great!

429
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:34,520
Quick! Go that way! Quick!

430
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:37,360
Give me, give me! Quick!

431
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,120
Give it to me!

432
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,160
Apologies for my brashness.

433
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,960
Your riding skills are really good!

434
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,400
You let me win.

435
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,160
What are you looking at?

436
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,480
I am looking at

437
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:09,480
the one who rode so well

438
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,600
turning out to be a girl!

439
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:11,920
So what?

440
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:14,200
Do you think that since you won over a girl, you won due to an unfair advantage?

441
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:16,560
No, I was just thinking--

442
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:17,840
Who cares what you're thinking.

443
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:20,320
Anyway, today I lost because I wasn't as skilled as you.

444
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,960
It's got nothing to do with gender, understand?

445
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:22,640
I know.

446
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,080
It's good that you know.

447
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,480
From your clothes,

448
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,880
are you a Qing official?

449
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:30,720
I'm insignificant, I'm just a small official.

450
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,320
You are the first person from the Central Plains

451
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,280
who is able to beat me!

452
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:35,000
It's just luck. Just luck.

453
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,640
Winning is winning, losing is losing.

454
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,880
What do you mean by luck?

455
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,440
I'll take you as a friend.

456
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,720
It is my good fortune.

457
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:41,920
My name is...

458
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,320
Saren.

459
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,720
Saren?

460
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,320
Miss Yueliang (Moon), how do you do?

461
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,560
You understand Mongolian?

462
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:50,680
A little.

463
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:51,840
Then, what is your name?

464
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,360
My name is...

465
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:54,840
Star.

466
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:55,840
Star?

467
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,120
May we meet again.

468
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,800
Star?

469
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,720
Too bad I'm not Moon.

470
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,360
Greetings to Imperial Father.

471
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,780
I was riding on the plains just now

472
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:26,340
and lost track of time, that's why I've arrived late.

473
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:27,760
Please forgive me.

474
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,320
Our people are horse-riding people,

475
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:31,680
our ancestors' blood flows within our bodies.

476
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,600
For one's blood to pound in excitement

477
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,120
when one sees the expansive plains,

478
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,600
is inevitable.

479
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,960
What is there to forgive? Rise and have a seat.

480
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,040
Thank you, Imperial Father.

481
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:43,240
Earlier, Imperial Father said

482
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,960
that of all the princes,

483
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,880
you're the one who's the most similar to a wild horse.

484
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,900
Imperial Father has been making a jest of me.

485
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:55,960
Greetings to Your Majesty.

486
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:06,800
Looks like, Ruoxi has something interesting

487
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,240
for me to try again.

488
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,160
Yes.

489
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:10,880
How perceptive, Your Majesty.

490
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,800
I just think Your Majesty is probably feeling a little hot,

491
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,760
so I prepared some chilled fruit juice.

492
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:15,840
Would your Majesty

493
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,560
be willing to try my culinary skills?

494
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,840
All right. Send it up for me to try.

495
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,960
I'll reward you if it's good,

496
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,080
If it's not good, I will have to punish you.

497
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,840
All is up to Your Majesty.

498
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:31,280
Your Majesty.

499
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:39,180
You've truly put quite a bit of thought into this.

500
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:51,500
I've never had anything prepared in this manner.

501
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:17,940
Magnolia.

502
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,580
Grapes.

503
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:38,960
I want to see

504
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:41,320
what other tricks you have up your sleeve.

505
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:44,040
Why haven't I seen this before?

506
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,040
Your Majesty.

507
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:47,640
These are designs Ruoxi drew before.

508
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:49,160
I thought they looked good,

509
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:51,080
so I sent the eunuch who does the grocery purchasing

510
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:53,860
send them to the palace kiln to be made.

511
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:55,240
How many different designs have been made in total?

512
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,800
36 in total.

513
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:57,880
But I've only brought these

514
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:58,760
on this trip.

515
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:00,020
When you have the chance,

516
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:02,840
I want to see the other designs.

517
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:03,640
All right.

518
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:05,840
How rare that you'd have such good will.

519
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:08,420
What would you like me to give you as a reward?

520
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:10,400
Even though I was the one who thought these up,

521
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,580
there are others who also put a lot of effort into them.

522
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:14,440
Your servant wouldn't dare take all the credit.

523
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:17,020
All right. Then let's reward everyone then.

524
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:19,520
Thank you, Your Majesty!

525
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,640
Now can you tell me

526
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,760
what you'd like as a reward?

527
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,460
When I saw Your Majesty's

528
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:28,100
heroic bearing on the horse,

529
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:29,340
I was very much in admiration and envy.

530
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:31,380
So I want to learn to ride as well.

531
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:34,000
Though I daren't hope to match even a thousandth of Your Majesty's skill,

532
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,240
I would be satisfied

533
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:38,160
with just knowing how to ride a horse.

534
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:41,420
She's flattering me just to learn how to ride a horse.

535
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:43,600
Your request is granted.

536
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,540
Thank you, Your Majesty!

537
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:00,840
We were rewarded with so much money!

538
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:02,360
The money isn't much really,

539
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,760
what's important is our face.

540
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:06,400
That's right. These are rewards personally given by the Majesty himself.

541
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,440
It's a first since I've entered the palace!

542
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:10,200
I don't know how to thank you, Jiejie.

543
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,160
All right. All right.

544
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,360
Don't thank me anymore.

545
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:13,840
This is what you all deserved as well.

546
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,460
We know how well Jiejie

547
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:16,320
treats us.

548
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,640
In the future, we'll definitely do our best to serve Jiejie.

549
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,600
That's right! That's right!

550
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:20,720
We'll definitely pay extra attention

551
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,400
when handling Jiejie's matters.

552
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:25,000
Then, it should be me thanking you all instead.

553
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,880
Let's all help each other in the future.

554
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:28,440
Jiejie!

555
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,600
Eunuch Wang.

556
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:33,160
What reward did you receive that you're smiling so happily?

557
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,460
No matter how much reward I get,

558
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:36,400
I wouldn't dare to act frivolously in front of Jiejie.

559
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:39,120
The Monglian King had an audience with His Majesty

560
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,560
and gifted him with two fine steeds.

561
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:41,540
The Emperor was so happy,

562
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:43,320
he decided to have a feast tonight!

563
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:44,900
That's such happy news.

564
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:46,740
The people of the plains are the most generous and welcoming.

565
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:47,800
and they're good at dancing too.

566
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:50,720
It's going to be fun tonight.

567
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:16,400
- A toast to you.
- Come, let's drink.

568
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:26,200
Don't, don't, don't.

569
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:18,640
She's singing so sweetly and passionately.

570
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:19,780
Do you know what she's singing about?

571
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:21,160
I don't understand Mongolian either.

572
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:52,480
Let's see how a stoic person like you

573
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:55,620
can withstand such fiery passion.

574
00:33:57,340 --> 00:33:58,900
Yutan, go find out

575
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:00,460
who this girl is.

576
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:02,820
Sure. Let's go.

577
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:14,200
You really are expressionless.

578
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:16,460
I salute you (modern slang).

579
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:30,100
Moon?

580
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:33,940
Star?

581
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:46,920
Jiejie,

582
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,200
she's the daughter of the Mongolian King.

583
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:50,000
Suwan Guwalgiya, Minmin,

584
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,520
a famous beauty in these plains.

585
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:06,200
May I dance for Your Majesty?

586
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,180
Sure!

587
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:10,180
Thank you, Your Majesty

588
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,580
That's great.

589
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:38,960
If back then,

590
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,960
I'd stayed by my parents side,

591
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:45,920
would I have less regrets?

592
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,280
What are you thinking

593
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,560
all by yourself out here?

594
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:03,440
I'd just thought of my parents.

595
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,880
Greetings to Fourth Prince, greetings to Thirteenth Prince.

596
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,240
You may rise.

597
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:15,320
What are you both doing out here too?

598
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:16,740
We drank too fast just now,

599
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:18,080
so we're now getting some fresh air.

600
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:20,840
Those wine vats (alcoholics) were willing to let you fellows off?

601
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:23,360
We said we had to make water, how could they not?

602
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:26,800
It's been a while since I left,

603
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,040
it's time I get back.

604
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:34,240
We should be getting back too.

605
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,247
Ruoxi,

606
00:38:39,247 --> 00:38:41,222
Imperial Father is really fond of

607
00:38:41,222 --> 00:38:43,200
that new set of tea cups that you made.

608
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,360
But why was it you gave me

609
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:47,100
the one decorated with plum blossoms?

610
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:49,160
Because the next ten years of your life

611
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,440
will be like a plum blossom

612
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:52,380
It'll only be fragrant after withstanding the bitter cold. (Chinese idiom, meaning you will only be able to do it after withstanding all sorts of difficulties)

613
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:54,440
Plum blossoms are among the Four Noble Flowers.

614
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:56,200
Don't you like them?

615
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,600
I just think it's weird,

616
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,400
why you chose Fourth Brother's favorite

617
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:00,920
magnolia for him.

618
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,160
So I just thought to ask.

619
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:05,800
You didn't tell me what you liked.

620
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,600
So of course I just picked one at random to give to you.

621
00:39:09,242 --> 00:39:10,880
But you never asked me either.

622
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:12,960
Your servant will take her leave now.

623
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,440
She left just like that?

624
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:19,620
Yes, she left.

625
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:22,445
You're the one who said she suddenly disappeared.

626
00:39:22,445 --> 00:39:23,180
Yes.

627
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:24,960
That's why I accompanied you to find her.

628
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,240
And now, you don't even say a thing,

629
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:27,640
and I'm the one who's being snubbed by the nose.

630
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:29,680
You were the one who was worried,

631
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:30,600
and I accompanied you to come out.

632
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:31,600
That's right.

633
00:39:36,897 --> 00:39:38,040
Miss Ruoxi,

634
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,200
just call your humble servant Niman.

635
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,760
Your servant has long heard that

636
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:41,880
General Niman has brilliant horse-riding skills.

637
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,538
I'll have to trouble you this time, General.

638
00:39:43,538 --> 00:39:45,163
Miss Ruoxi is too polite.

639
00:39:45,163 --> 00:39:46,881
Even though I don't really know how to ride a horse,

640
00:39:46,881 --> 00:39:48,000
but I've also sat on one before.

641
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,680
You can just teach me how to ride directly.

642
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:51,720
I think it'd be safer if your servant

643
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:52,800
leads the horse.

644
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:58,422
Greetings to Fourth Prince.

645
00:39:58,422 --> 00:39:59,580
Greetings to Thirteenth Prince.

646
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:00,320
Greetings to the princes.

647
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,200
You're excused.

648
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,369
How are your lessons going?

649
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:06,080
I've only learned how to not fall while sitting on a horse.

650
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:06,840
You can go back first.

651
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:07,895
Yes.

652
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:13,329
How was he teaching me to ride?

653
00:40:13,329 --> 00:40:14,580
He was just totally treating me like a kid.

654
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:16,080
Don't say that.

655
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,912
Even kids ride better than you.

656
00:40:17,912 --> 00:40:18,902
Isn't that so, Fourth Brother?

657
00:40:20,248 --> 00:40:22,477
Why don't you, Thirteenth Prince, teach me to ride then?

658
00:40:22,477 --> 00:40:24,056
After all you've already promised.

659
00:40:24,056 --> 00:40:25,310
Since when did I promise you?

660
00:40:25,310 --> 00:40:26,400
When we were on the way here!

661
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,520
We're already here now.

662
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:31,069
Besides, the Emperor has already given his permission,

663
00:40:31,069 --> 00:40:33,484
how can you still not teach me?

664
00:40:34,087 --> 00:40:35,240
Fourth Brother,

665
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:36,874
she's using Imperial Father to put pressure on me.

666
00:40:36,874 --> 00:40:38,128
This is a very heavy responsibility to carry.

667
00:40:41,657 --> 00:40:42,640
All right, all right.

668
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:45,047
We have to rush back now to eat with Father.

669
00:40:45,047 --> 00:40:48,069
Let's make it at night. I'm free at night, I'll teach you then.

670
00:40:48,069 --> 00:40:50,016
Great! Thanks!

671
00:40:50,992 --> 00:40:53,499
Your servant takes her leave now. Your servant takes her leave now.

672
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:02,834
It's a heavy responsibility and you have a long way more to carry it.

673
00:41:04,232 --> 00:41:05,486
I...

674
00:41:08,923 --> 00:41:12,127
Teaching girls how to ride, that's not my forte.

675
00:41:17,711 --> 00:41:18,700
Yutan, Yunxiang,

676
00:41:19,529 --> 00:41:20,411
I won't be here tonight.

677
00:41:20,411 --> 00:41:21,804
Make sure you take care of everything and serve the Emperor well.

678
00:41:21,804 --> 00:41:24,298
The weather's hot, so the tea needs to be milder, and let it cool for a while.

679
00:41:24,298 --> 00:41:25,984
Surely. Jiejie, don't worry and go riding.

680
00:41:25,984 --> 00:41:27,191
We will take care of it

681
00:41:28,167 --> 00:41:31,120
May I ask if Miss Ruoxi is here?

682
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:33,043
Who is it? Come in.

683
00:41:35,597 --> 00:41:37,144
Under Beile's orders, your servant

684
00:41:37,144 --> 00:41:38,848
has brought these to Miss Ruoxi.

685
00:42:03,368 --> 00:42:04,576
Did Eighth Prince say anything?

686
00:42:04,576 --> 00:42:05,629
Beile said

687
00:42:05,629 --> 00:42:07,541
that when Miss Ruoxi sees other people riding horses,

688
00:42:07,541 --> 00:42:08,469
but isn't able to on her own,

689
00:42:08,469 --> 00:42:09,345
she will definitely learn herself.

690
00:42:09,345 --> 00:42:11,402
So he had it all prepared for Miss Ruoxi.

691
00:42:11,402 --> 00:42:12,795
Older sisters really know their younger sisters the best.

692
00:42:12,795 --> 00:42:13,887
It must be your sister

693
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:15,141
who asked Beile to send these.

694
00:42:15,141 --> 00:42:16,062
Of course!

695
00:42:16,062 --> 00:42:17,648
Your sister is so perceptive,

696
00:42:17,648 --> 00:42:19,413
knowing Ruoxi Jiejie likes to move around.

697
00:42:19,413 --> 00:42:21,039
Beile also asked

698
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:22,525
for Miss to take safety first.

699
00:42:23,407 --> 00:42:25,683
I got it. Please leave them here for me.

700
00:42:25,683 --> 00:42:26,565
Come with me.

701
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:33,140
He's really perceptive.

702
00:42:49,971 --> 00:42:52,528
There's still some pros to coming early.

703
00:42:52,528 --> 00:42:55,447
Lying here and looking at the stars. It really is beautiful.

704
00:43:05,246 --> 00:43:07,793
It's nice to lie here and look at the stars.

705
00:43:07,793 --> 00:43:09,197
Why don't you get down and join me?

706
00:43:15,684 --> 00:43:19,078
I got sleepy after waiting for you so long. Let's learn tomorrow instead.

707
00:43:19,078 --> 00:43:20,003
Tonight,

708
00:43:20,003 --> 00:43:22,064
let's just lie here and look at the stars.

709
00:43:22,064 --> 00:43:23,500
That will work.

710
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:32,259
Greetings to Fourth Prince.

711
00:43:34,265 --> 00:43:35,566
Dispense with ceremony.

712
00:43:38,245 --> 00:43:39,359
Where's Thirteenth Prince?

713
00:43:39,359 --> 00:43:41,078
The Crown Prince called for Thirteenth Prince to come over.

714
00:43:41,078 --> 00:43:43,017
So I've come in place of him to teach you.

715
00:43:43,017 --> 00:43:44,529
Then I'll go back first then,

716
00:43:44,529 --> 00:43:46,511
I'll just get Thirteenth Prince to teach me another time.

717
00:43:47,394 --> 00:43:49,158
You think I can't teach you?

718
00:43:49,158 --> 00:43:50,087
No!

719
00:43:51,309 --> 00:43:53,034
It's just that I'm tired.

720
00:43:53,034 --> 00:43:55,613
All right. Then let us lie here then

721
00:43:55,613 --> 00:43:57,285
and look at the stars.

722
00:43:59,818 --> 00:44:03,140
Your servant... isn't sleepy anymore.

723
00:44:10,288 --> 00:44:11,310
Get on the horse then.

724
00:44:15,954 --> 00:44:18,880
Straighten your back and hold tight with your hands.

725
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:24,195
Grab firmly with your hands.

726
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:28,214
Steer with your reins to control your direction.

727
00:44:32,533 --> 00:44:34,298
Pull this way. Pull this way!

728
00:44:38,524 --> 00:44:39,546
Hold on tight.

729
00:44:44,259 --> 00:44:45,652
Be careful.

730
00:44:45,652 --> 00:44:47,649
Straighten your back and grip it tight.

731
00:44:47,649 --> 00:44:49,878
Turn around. Turn this way.

732
00:45:01,024 --> 00:45:02,557
Jiejie, what's wrong?

733
00:45:02,557 --> 00:45:04,089
You were so happy when you left,

734
00:45:04,089 --> 00:45:05,050
and you come back exhausted.

735
00:45:05,050 --> 00:45:05,993
Was it very tiring?

736
00:45:06,983 --> 00:45:09,072
Very tiring.

737
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:12,077
Why doesn't Thirteenth Prince know how to treat women gently and kindly?

738
00:45:13,331 --> 00:45:15,095
The one who taught me to ride tonight

739
00:45:15,095 --> 00:45:17,410
wasn't Thirteenth Prince, it was Fourth Prince!

740
00:45:17,410 --> 00:45:19,786
Fourth Prince? Fourth Prince is brilliant at horse-riding,

741
00:45:19,786 --> 00:45:21,086
You're lucky

742
00:45:21,086 --> 00:45:22,340
to have him teach you.

743
00:45:23,408 --> 00:45:25,187
When one is before a strict teacher,

744
00:45:25,187 --> 00:45:26,627
it's very easy for a stupid student

745
00:45:26,627 --> 00:45:28,684
to make the teacher angry.

746
00:45:28,684 --> 00:45:29,617
If something goes wrong,

747
00:45:29,617 --> 00:45:31,117
he might pretend not to know you

748
00:45:31,117 --> 00:45:32,989
and think that you've made him lose face.

749
00:45:32,989 --> 00:45:35,450
If you do anything that makes him unhappy,

750
00:45:35,450 --> 00:45:37,229
there will be grave consequences.

751
00:45:37,229 --> 00:45:38,662
Couldn't be, could it?

752
00:45:38,662 --> 00:45:40,034
Although Fourth Prince is very serious,

753
00:45:40,034 --> 00:45:41,705
he isn't that severe either.

754
00:45:41,705 --> 00:45:43,099
Even if Jiejie isn't able to learn it well,

755
00:45:43,099 --> 00:45:45,328
Fourth Prince is going to use thunderbolt-like punishments on you?

756
00:45:45,328 --> 00:45:46,428
That's absolutely right.

757
00:45:46,428 --> 00:45:47,910
Even though I might be clever,

758
00:45:47,910 --> 00:45:49,136
he's also a person to reckon with.

759
00:45:50,738 --> 00:45:52,224
Never mind. You won't get it.

760
00:45:53,292 --> 00:45:54,746
Jiejie, you worry to much.

761
00:45:54,746 --> 00:45:55,986
Even the Emperor

762
00:45:55,986 --> 00:45:57,518
is impressed by you,

763
00:45:57,518 --> 00:45:58,819
let alone Fourth Prince.

764
00:46:00,342 --> 00:46:02,153
Never mind, let's not talk about it anymore. I'm going to sleep now.

765
00:46:02,153 --> 00:46:03,625
I'll go blow the lights out for you.

766
00:46:03,625 --> 00:46:05,204
No need. I'll do it myself.

767
00:46:13,238 --> 00:46:16,410
I don't hope for merit, just for no mistakes.

768
00:46:16,410 --> 00:46:18,207
It'll be fine as long as I don't offend him.

769
00:46:21,644 --> 00:46:22,898
As for horse-riding,

770
00:46:22,898 --> 00:46:24,709
I definitely can't ride with Fourth Prince.

771
00:46:26,682 --> 00:46:29,562
To have a ticking t

772
00:46:29,562 --> 00:46:30,676
that's too torturous.
