♫  In the blink of an eye, a thought of stubborn persistence  ♫

3
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:24,120
♫  We were destined to seek our doom like moths flying towards the flame  ♫

4
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:30,770
♫  Knowing that it’d be a disaster, why am I still at a loss about what to do  ♫

♫  The best is not to see, the best is not to miss you  ♫

00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:43,660
♫  Only like this can I not be in love with you  ♫

7
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:47,820
♫  Just another brushing of the shoulder, and from then...♫

8
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:53,140
♫  I’ll keep falling deeper and deeper in love with you  ♫

9
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:57,950
♫  It’s the mistake of time,  ♫

10

♫ forcing us to pass each other by   ♫

11
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:05,260
♫  How I miss you, how far you are  ♫

Scarlet Heart
Episode 16

24
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:11,180
Greetings to Your Majesty.

25
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:16,179
Ruoxi, you've been busy working on this for two months.

26
00:02:16,179 --> 00:02:18,380
Today, I'm looking forward to seeing the fruits of your labor.

27
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:20,020
In that case, I will give the order for the performance to start.

28
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:20,900
Good.

29
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:22,500
Please, come.

30
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:53,620
Plum flower fragrance?

31
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:57,500
How can plum flowers be found in this kind of place?

32
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:31,860
Fourth Brother, looking at the this opening scene,

33
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:33,620
it seems to be worth watching.

34
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:05,520
♫ The sky has already gone dark, the sun is resting. ♫

35
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:11,670
♫ In the faraway sky, I see the twinkling stars ♫

36
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:13,380
♫ Fantasizing about a sky with you and I ♫

37
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:15,940
Ruoxi, you have made Minmin

38
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:18,060
metamorphosize into a new star of the grasslands.

39
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:20,340
Thank you Fourteenth Prince for your praise,

40
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:21,620
but Minmin

41
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:23,340
was already a star.

42
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:25,500
I only removed the dark cloth that covered the star,

43
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,940
and revealed what's within.

44
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,020
But this star

45
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:32,220
hasn't even glanced at the moon the whole night.

46
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:34,820
In the short span of two months,

47
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:37,380
she already isn't the little girl who acts as she wishes.

48
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:38,540
She no longer looks at the moon,

49
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:41,180
perhaps because the sun has already appeared.

50
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:44,660
I hope that's the case.

51
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:55,380
♫ Snowflakes are red and plum blossoms flutter in the air ♫

52
00:04:55,380 --> 00:05:01,500
♫ Your concern always touches my heart ♫

53
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:07,840
♫ Recalling your tenderness, my feelings become as rosy as the flowers ♫

54
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:14,000
♫ Actually, I, too, am afraid of the piercing pain of the cold ♫

55
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,020
♫ Snowflakes are red and plum blossoms flutter in the air, the night is icy cold ♫

56
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:20,100
From now on,

57
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,140
when you see white snow and red plum blossoms,

58
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:24,740
you will probably always think of Minmin.

59
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:27,780
Good! This is great!

60
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:29,640
It's so beautiful.

61
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,740
It is. It is.

62
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:38,810
♫ I can only think of you, allowing love to float in the wind, ♫

63
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:42,480
♫ not returning anymore ♫

64
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:16,280
♫ Autumn is over and the cold winter is soon approaching ♫

65
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:22,540
♫ Seeing the plum blossoms and leaves fall down in front of me ♫

66
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:28,820
♫ It's a starry night, however, I'm unable to caress your face ♫

67
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:34,970
♫ Missing you alone, yet the memories are unable to cease anymore ♫

68
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:41,350
♫ Snowflakes are red and plum blossoms flutter in the air ♫

69
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:47,500
♫ Your concern always touches my heart ♫

70
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:53,810
♫ Recalling your tenderness, my feelings become as rosy as the flowers ♫

71
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:59,960
♫ Actually, I, too, am afraid of the piercing pain of the cold ♫

72
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:06,190
♫ Snowflakes are red and plum blossoms flutter in the air, the night is icy cold ♫

73
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:12,480
♫ The lighting of candles makes me think of a beautiful dream ♫

74
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,780
♫ The northern wind keeps blowing ♫

75
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:15,740
Not bad. Not bad.

76
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:17,340
Ruoxi, come here.

77
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:19,740
Summoning Ruoxi!

78
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:28,220
Your Majesty.

79
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:29,580
What a wonderful performance.

80
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:31,280
I was captivated by it.

81
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,940
If I had known you had such an ability,

82
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:36,640
I would have let you handle all the palace performances.

83
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,540
Your servant only have this bit of ability.

84
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:40,440
It's only some lowly skill; and

85
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,040
has already exhausted my limited abilities.

86
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,400
Your Imperial Majesty, therefore, should not make things difficult for your servant.

87
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,980
Tonight's dance performance

88
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:49,160
is so lovely. It was all due to Minmin.

89
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,680
Min'min Ge'Ge.
(Princess Minmin)

90
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:55,900
Your Imperial Majesty.

91
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:58,180
I just saw that your long sleeve weaving,

92
00:07:58,180 --> 00:07:59,620
ribbon-like, floating and dancing,

93
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:02,600
your body bending in the wind, similar to a willow tree,

94
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,740
reminded me of a lotus flower rising above green water.

95
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:08,020
I thought a goddess had descended from heaven.

96
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,260
Your Imperial Majesty is exaggerating.

97
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,700
Reward her with the Jade Ruyi.

98
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,100
Yes, Sire.

99
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:17,900
Thank you, Imperial Majesty.

100
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:24,180
I'd like to award something to Ruoxi.

101
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:26,860
Hurry up and say thank you.

102
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:28,340
Thank you, Your Highness.

103
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:34,620
The exact same jade pendant.

104
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:37,060
Minmin has one as well

105
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:38,780
Originally,

106
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:40,739
Minmin had an older twin sister.

107
00:08:40,739 --> 00:08:42,100
After the two were born,

108
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:43,780
I could hardly contain my joy.

109
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:46,500
At the same time, I got a beautiful piece of jade

110
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:49,259
and ordered two jade pendant pieces to be made.

111
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:52,860
I never thought that before the pendants were finished

112
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:56,340
her sister would pass away.

113
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:00,280
This jade pendant

114
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,360
represents Wang Ye's feelings for his daughter.

115
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,060
I don't dare accept.

116
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:07,000
Since I gave it to you,

117
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,940
there is no daren't about it.

118
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:11,700
Then you should accept it.

119
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,140
Thank you, Wang Ye.

120
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:15,300
All right, get up. Get up.

121
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:17,120
Wang Ye, I'm tired.

122
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,680
Why don't we return, to rest?

123
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,100
Please.

124
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:24,020
Crown Prince, I'll leave you in charge.

125
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:25,000
Yes.

126
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,140
Walk well, Your Majesty.

127
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:34,980
Come, serve the wine.

128
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:39,460
To send off Heshu and Zhoying,

129
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:40,580
why don't we brothers

130
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:41,980
drink with them.

131
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:43,340
Thank you, Crown Prince.

132
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:48,420
Here, I'll toast you two.

133
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:50,940
Tonight, none of us will return home sober.

134
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:52,420
Here, cheers.

135
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:54,460
What are you thinking about?

136
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:58,180
Already, bright purple and passion pink bloom in profusion
(The Peony Pavilion)

137
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:00,300
Yet

138
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,460
such splendor is abandoned to crumbling, well-faded walls

139
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:06,380
But in this glorious season

140
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:11,580
where are the sounds of joy in this garden?

141
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:14,040
What are you talking about?

142
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:18,500
It's nothing, I'm just sad.

143
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,300
Tomorrow, you will have to leave.

144
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,420
Happy times

145
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:25,320
are always too short.

146
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:28,340
I don't know when we will be able to meet again.

147
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:30,500
I have a parting gift to give you.

148
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,340
I promised you before.

149
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:34,660
What?

150
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,580
Crown Prince,

151
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:40,080
I want to play a song

152
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,680
for everyone.

153
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,300
Why not?

154
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:44,780
All of us know

155
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:46,080
that your flute playing is good.

156
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,200
Tonight,

157
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,420
let us have the good fortune of listening to your flute.

158
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,280
I don't know why, but

159
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:32,900
I suddenly want to go far, far away.

160
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,900
I want peace.

161
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:38,100
Others say

162
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:40,180
music is gradually fading and sound is disappearing,

163
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:42,540
feeling too much is more troubling than not feeling.

164
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:45,740
If people didn't have emotions,

165
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:49,060
then they can truly leave troubles behind.

166
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:54,540
After a happy gathering

167
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:57,660
I've always felt more deserted.

168
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,220
Do you think MinMin and Zuoying

169
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:18,640
have a possibility of being together?

170
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:20,020
4th Prince's meaning is...

171
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:23,340
Last night, I saw that your eyes

172
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:25,420
kept looking at them.

173
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:28,980
I truly wish for them to be together.

174
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,900
What does 4th Prince think?

175
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:35,340
This Prince Zuoying has great ability,

176
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:36,820
but because he was born of a commoner,

177
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:39,020
he isn't valued by Yinergenluo Wang Ye.

178
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:41,900
Seeing Imperial Father this time

179
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:44,580
was not a particularly important task.

180
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:46,300
So it was given to him.

181
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,100
But,

182
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:52,700
I thought this is good fortune born from misfortune.

183
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:55,520
I'm afraid in the future,

184
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:58,460
he will cause trouble for his father and brother.

185
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:01,680
Then is Minmin marrying Zuoying

186
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,680
the best choice?

187
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:06,980
This is none of your business.

188
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:08,900
You're just being a matchmaker.

189
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:13,900
Are you willing to be by yourself your entire life?

190
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:17,780
Don't say any nonsense like being filial.

191
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:22,420
I'm too tired.

192
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:23,900
These years in the palace

193
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:25,360
are full of rules

194
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,480
and schemes.

195
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,380
Actions have to be thought through 3 times

196
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:31,620
and pondered on for 3 more times.

197
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,500
But I am not that type of person.

198
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:36,380
I just want to go far away,

199
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:39,260
laugh when I want to,

200
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:41,060
and cry when I want to.

201
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:44,980
At this moment, marrying

202
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:47,460
is trading the big cage of the Forbidden City

203
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:49,340
for a smaller cage.

204
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:52,280
I would be more well-regarded in the Forbidden City than after marriage.

205
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,540
So why should I marry?

206
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:57,120
Thinking of the fighting between wives after marriage,

207
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,300
I think shaving my head and becoming a nun would be better.

208
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:04,040
With your current status,

209
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:06,640
it is impossible for you to make that decision.

210
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,540
The more Imperial Father values you,

211
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:10,700
the less you can control your marriage.

212
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,800
Take for example, Wang Ye giving you the jade pendant.

213
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:18,540
Wang Ye implied that he thought of you as a daughter.

214
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:20,280
Minmin and her brother

215
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:22,340
treat you better than the Crown Prince.

216
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:26,300
Although we don't know what Wang Ye's motives are,

217
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:28,740
when Imperial Father arranges your marriage

218
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:32,280
it will have to be thought over very seriously.

219
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:35,100
If you wish to be like the other palace maids

220
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,140
and be released from the palace when your time is up,

221
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:39,440
then let me advise you

222
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,000
to stop dreaming.

223
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,580
Why don't you think about

224
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:46,200
how to let Imperial Father

225
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,740
arrange a marriage

226
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:49,220
that will make you satisfied?

227
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:52,760
If I don't want to marry,

228
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,800
then no one can force me.

229
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,620
Then you should prepare 3 meters of white cloth;
(To commit suicide)

230
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:59,060
and harden your heart

231
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:00,220
against caring that your death

232
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:02,680
will cause trouble to your father and clan.

233
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:09,340
The palace does not allow for dreams.

234
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:12,920
I advise you to wake up

235
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:15,120
and think of your next step.

236
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,520
When the matter finally comes,

237
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:19,280
you won't be able to do anything.

238
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:21,320
Is not marrying really not a possibility?

239
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:23,300
I will not hurt anyone by not marrying,

240
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:25,100
so why do I still have to marry?

241
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:26,820
Do you not understand what I'm saying,

242
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:28,580
or is it that you don't want to understand?

243
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:31,900
Imperial Father is the one to make the decision;

244
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:33,300
you can only be obedient.

245
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:41,480
Or is it that in your heart,

246
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:43,860
there is no one you want to marry?

247
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:49,980
Is there no one that you can be free with?

248
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:18,540
I saw a document that would make anyone angry.

249
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:19,940
I sent

250
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:22,340
money for the natural disaster victims of Fujian,

251
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:24,740
but actually, the money was taken by my officials.

252
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:27,100
So many people died of hunger.

253
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:29,019
If there were no one backing them,

254
00:17:29,019 --> 00:17:30,580
how would the officials

255
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:32,720
dare to take such an action?

256
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:36,420
I love my people like my children,

257
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:37,660
but my servants

258
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:40,540
see the people's money and food

259
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:42,060
as their own.

260
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:46,260
I ordered 4th Prince to investigate the matter;

261
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:49,160
and found that the officials of the Ministry of Revenue were also involved.

262
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,940
There was a total of 120 officials.

263
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:52,580
120 officials!

264
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:59,700
You tell me. How should I handle these 120 officials?

265
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:13,300
8th Prince, what are your views?

266
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:15,020
Yes, Imperial Father.

267
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:16,860
Corrupt officials are indeed abominable

268
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:18,880
and should not be tolerated.

269
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,620
However, this time there are other considerations.

270
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:23,360
The number of officials are too numerous.

271
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,320
One decision may set into motion a chain reaction of events,

272
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:28,020
causing people to become anxious, and political turmoil in the court.

273
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:29,500
May I boldly suggest,

274
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,140
that Imperial Father consider the bigger picture

275
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:32,340
by taking action after taking the circumstances into consideration?

276
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:34,640
Order the officials to return the laundered money,

277
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:38,100
and be lenient with those who acknowledge the error of their ways.

278
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:41,258
Fourth Prince,

279
00:18:41,258 --> 00:18:42,420
what do you think?

280
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:44,180
Yes, Imperial Father.

281
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:46,472
I think that such indulgent actions will only breed more corrupt officials.

282
00:18:46,472 --> 00:18:48,529
If it is just because the number of officials involved are too many

283
00:18:48,529 --> 00:18:50,160
and thus their punishment is leniency,

284
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,100
then these corrupt grasping officials will become more undisciplined.

285
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:54,620
I'm afraid that the behavior of these officials may worsen in the coming days.

286
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:56,960
The sanctity of the office will be compromised and they will continue to show no concern for the common people,

287
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,359
taking advantage of the strength of their numbers to commit even more evil deeds.

288
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:01,609
Even the Emperor's authority cannot overcome it.

289
00:19:01,609 --> 00:19:04,980
In the future, Imperial Father will have a harder time governing the court.

290
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:06,446
Imperial Father.

291
00:19:06,446 --> 00:19:08,122
In troubled times, severe punishment should be employed to control the situation.

292
00:19:08,122 --> 00:19:09,383
I also think,

293
00:19:09,383 --> 00:19:11,333
when faced with people who are corrupt and abusers of the law,

294
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:14,162
there should be no tolerance.

295
00:19:14,162 --> 00:19:17,192
Crown Prince, what do you think?

296
00:19:17,192 --> 00:19:20,039
I think that using severe punishment

297
00:19:20,039 --> 00:19:21,357
will induce panic in the people

298
00:19:21,357 --> 00:19:22,797
and result in tumoil in the court.

299
00:19:22,797 --> 00:19:24,144
If the consequences are dire,

300
00:19:24,144 --> 00:19:25,955
at the very least, there will be uncertainties swirling around.

301
00:19:25,955 --> 00:19:27,327
At the most serious, some people may take drastic action and

302
00:19:27,327 --> 00:19:28,695
political unrest will be unavoidable.

303
00:19:28,695 --> 00:19:31,677
This won't benefit the common people.

304
00:19:31,677 --> 00:19:32,942
I feel that

305
00:19:32,942 --> 00:19:35,250
any action should take into consideration the circumstances,

306
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:37,823
and the punishment should be lenient.

307
00:19:37,823 --> 00:19:40,578
What you have said is reasonable and fair.

308
00:19:40,578 --> 00:19:43,832
Fine, the matter shall be dealt with in accordance with your opinion.

309
00:19:43,832 --> 00:19:45,450
Imperial Father, please rescind your command.

310
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:47,215
This matter has wide-spread implications,

311
00:19:47,215 --> 00:19:48,369
if it is not investigated thoroughly and severe punishments are not meted out,

312
00:19:48,369 --> 00:19:49,677
the officials who are corrupt and abuse the law

313
00:19:49,677 --> 00:19:51,291
will become worse and worse.

314
00:19:53,229 --> 00:19:55,255
I have made my decision already.

315
00:19:55,255 --> 00:19:58,291
Imperial Father, in the last case involving corrupt officials,

316
00:19:58,291 --> 00:19:59,550
only the people who took the most money,

317
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:00,651
Xu Gan Xue and Gao Shi Qi, only these two

318
00:20:00,651 --> 00:20:02,026
were dismissed from their government positions,

319
00:20:02,026 --> 00:20:03,362
which has already resulted in the loss of the people's confidence.

320
00:20:03,362 --> 00:20:05,614
Now there are folk songs being spread amongst the common people,

321
00:20:05,614 --> 00:20:07,965
all the taxes around China went to the East Sea,

322
00:20:07,965 --> 00:20:10,790
and all the tributes from other countries were offered to Tai Ren.

323
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:12,316
Imperial Father shouldn't

324
00:20:12,316 --> 00:20:13,663
tolerate such behavior anymore.

325
00:20:13,663 --> 00:20:17,030
Haven't I said my decision has been made?

326
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:19,066
The common people not understanding

327
00:20:19,066 --> 00:20:20,704
my intentions is excusable.

328
00:20:20,704 --> 00:20:22,147
I don't blame them.

329
00:20:22,147 --> 00:20:23,894
You are my son,

330
00:20:23,894 --> 00:20:25,419
yet you and the ignorant common people

331
00:20:25,419 --> 00:20:26,555
share the same banal thinking.

332
00:20:26,555 --> 00:20:29,231
Also, you want to relentlessly chase after the officials and give severe punishments,

333
00:20:29,231 --> 00:20:32,674
but you don't have the least bit of a gentlemen's benevolence.

334
00:20:32,674 --> 00:20:34,407
Your time spent reading the teachings of the sages has been in vain.

335
00:20:34,407 --> 00:20:35,522
Imperial Father.

336
00:20:35,522 --> 00:20:37,890
Every word that 4th Brother has spoken came from the bottom of his heart.

337
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:40,073
He and all of you are dismissed.

338
00:20:41,418 --> 00:20:42,766
Yes.

339
00:20:44,826 --> 00:20:47,526
Yes.

340
00:21:03,619 --> 00:21:05,574
I'm fine, you can go back first.

341
00:21:05,574 --> 00:21:07,099
I want to be alone for a while.

342
00:21:16,889 --> 00:21:18,477
Wang Gong'gong, 4th Prince is nowhere to be found.

343
00:21:18,477 --> 00:21:19,720
- Keep looking.
-  Yes.

344
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,435
13th Prince, 4th Prince hasn't be found.

345
00:21:21,435 --> 00:21:23,387
- Keeping looking.
- Yes.

346
00:21:23,387 --> 00:21:24,751
Keep looking.

347
00:21:24,751 --> 00:21:27,366
13th Prince, we didn't find him either.

348
00:21:27,366 --> 00:21:29,985
- Continue to search.
- Yes.

349
00:21:29,985 --> 00:21:31,896
Ruoxi, did you see Fourth Brother?

350
00:21:31,896 --> 00:21:33,739
I didn't. Did something happen?

351
00:21:33,739 --> 00:21:35,151
Imperial Father has summoned him.

352
00:21:35,151 --> 00:21:35,985
I have searched everywhere,

353
00:21:35,985 --> 00:21:37,660
but I still can't find him.

354
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:40,021
How can 4th Prince disappear without a trace?

355
00:21:40,021 --> 00:21:41,032
At today's court session,

356
00:21:41,032 --> 00:21:41,875
everyone was discussing

357
00:21:41,875 --> 00:21:44,347
how to handle the Ministry of Revenue's corruption case.

358
00:21:44,347 --> 00:21:46,362
4th Brother's views differed from Imperial Father's;

359
00:21:46,362 --> 00:21:48,787
and he was reprimanded in front of everyone.

360
00:21:48,787 --> 00:21:50,420
4th Prince has always been cautious.

361
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:53,342
Why did he have a direct confrontation with the Emperor?

362
00:21:53,342 --> 00:21:54,189
This matter

363
00:21:54,189 --> 00:21:55,757
can't be explained clearly in a few words.

364
00:21:55,757 --> 00:21:57,718
The crucial thing now is that Imperial Father wants to see him,

365
00:21:57,718 --> 00:21:59,772
but there's no trace of him anywhere.

366
00:21:59,772 --> 00:22:02,434
I know where 4th Prince might be.

367
00:22:02,434 --> 00:22:05,313
Come along with me to have a look.

368
00:22:05,313 --> 00:22:06,846
Are you coming or not?

369
00:22:08,709 --> 00:22:10,643
Wait a moment!

370
00:22:16,521 --> 00:22:19,050
4th Brother!

371
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:23,859
4th Brother!

372
00:22:23,859 --> 00:22:31,564
- 4th Brother!
- 4th Prince!

373
00:22:31,564 --> 00:22:34,218
Look, he's over there.

374
00:22:37,151 --> 00:22:40,913
Fourth brother! Fourth Brother.

375
00:22:40,913 --> 00:22:42,803
I've finally found you.

376
00:22:42,803 --> 00:22:45,528
Imperial Father wants to see you right now.

377
00:22:45,528 --> 00:22:47,950
Greetings, 4th Prince.

378
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:49,344
Then let's go back.

379
00:22:55,818 --> 00:22:57,262
It's not the Emperor who's worried,

380
00:22:57,262 --> 00:22:58,223
but the Eunuch in this case.

Understand?

383
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:09,066
Greetings, Imperial Father.

384
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:12,078
- Rise.
- Thank you, Imperial Father.

385
00:23:12,078 --> 00:23:14,893
Crown Prince, you explain it to them.

386
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:20,393
Yes.

387
00:23:20,393 --> 00:23:22,730
Imperial Father has already decided

388
00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:26,129
to thoroughly investigate Fujian's case of corruption and fraud,

389
00:23:26,129 --> 00:23:29,266
to see if, besides the 120 officials,

390
00:23:29,266 --> 00:23:32,241
there are any other people involved in the matter.

391
00:23:32,241 --> 00:23:34,092
4th Prince,

392
00:23:35,049 --> 00:23:37,132
you and 13th Prince

393
00:23:37,132 --> 00:23:39,197
will assist the Crown Prince in the investigation.

394
00:23:39,197 --> 00:23:40,329
Yes.

395
00:23:40,329 --> 00:23:42,322
Are you puzzled about

396
00:23:42,322 --> 00:23:46,159
why just now I rejected your suggestions,

397
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:49,149
but now I want you to thoroughly investigate?

398
00:23:49,149 --> 00:23:51,332
Indeed I don't understand.

399
00:23:51,332 --> 00:23:54,525
You don't understand.

400
00:23:54,525 --> 00:23:57,155
Is it because you don't know when to be strict and when to relax?

401
00:23:57,155 --> 00:24:00,280
Just like a basin of water that is no longer clean,

402
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:02,502
although it can't be used for drinking,

403
00:24:02,502 --> 00:24:06,986
it still can be used to water flowers and grow plants.

404
00:24:06,986 --> 00:24:09,725
It doesn't need to be thrown away.

405
00:24:09,725 --> 00:24:11,333
Do you understand?

406
00:24:11,333 --> 00:24:13,573
Yes, I do.

407
00:24:13,573 --> 00:24:16,349
Governing a large nation is like cooking a small delicacy.

408
00:24:16,349 --> 00:24:19,531
Effective governance sometimes requires a light hand.

409
00:24:19,531 --> 00:24:22,050
I have governed the country for many years.

410
00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:24,618
All my sincere words of advice,

411
00:24:24,618 --> 00:24:26,644
you all must firmly bear them in mind.

412
00:24:28,037 --> 00:24:31,881
I will remember Imperial Father's teachings.

Timing and Subtitles brought to you by the Bu Bu Jing Xin Team @Viki.com

414
00:24:40,628 --> 00:24:43,727
It's not as if Crown Prince doesn't have his own men,

415
00:24:43,727 --> 00:24:44,598
so why does Imperial Father

416
00:24:44,598 --> 00:24:45,917
order the two of us to aid in

417
00:24:45,917 --> 00:24:47,771
his investigations of the Fujian case?

418
00:24:49,596 --> 00:24:51,572
You think Imperial Father is completely unaware

419
00:24:51,572 --> 00:24:53,122
of Crown Prince's doings?

420
00:24:53,122 --> 00:24:54,708
What you're saying is Imperial Father

421
00:24:54,708 --> 00:24:57,293
fears the Crown Prince's men are involved,

422
00:24:57,293 --> 00:24:59,222
so the Crown Prince won't be impartial.

423
00:25:03,107 --> 00:25:04,809
That's correct.

424
00:25:04,809 --> 00:25:05,886
Imperial Father is also aware

425
00:25:05,886 --> 00:25:07,400
that among all the princes,

426
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,219
the Crown Prince trusts you the most.

427
00:25:09,219 --> 00:25:11,659
By making you the Inspector,

428
00:25:11,659 --> 00:25:14,902
the Crown Prince won't mind it as much.

429
00:25:14,902 --> 00:25:17,013
This is a highly dangerous position.

430
00:25:17,013 --> 00:25:19,879
If I don't do this right, I will not only offend the Crown Prince,

431
00:25:19,879 --> 00:25:21,490
I might be punished for not doing the task well.

432
00:25:26,607 --> 00:25:28,758
4th Brother, you don't need to worry too much.

433
00:25:29,693 --> 00:25:32,140
Just get on a small boat,

434
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:33,255
take a quick nap,

435
00:25:33,255 --> 00:25:34,737
and admire the lotus flowers.

436
00:25:34,737 --> 00:25:36,456
Then, you will naturally think of a solution.

437
00:25:37,790 --> 00:25:39,360
You have always been a straight talker.

438
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,743
How did you learn to talk with hidden meanings?

439
00:25:41,743 --> 00:25:45,197
Isn't 4th Brother treating us the same? Before you would say everything without reserve.

440
00:25:45,708 --> 00:25:47,123
Since when does

441
00:25:47,123 --> 00:25:48,787
a girl, from another family, know a secret,

442
00:25:48,787 --> 00:25:49,848
while your own brothers

443
00:25:49,848 --> 00:25:51,016
are kept in the dark?

444
00:25:52,256 --> 00:25:53,896
It's nothing special.

445
00:25:53,896 --> 00:25:55,010
What's there to tell?

446
00:25:55,586 --> 00:25:56,754
Just a fated chance,

447
00:25:56,754 --> 00:25:58,222
that Ruoxi happened to find out.

448
00:25:59,308 --> 00:26:00,490
"Fated chance."

449
00:26:00,894 --> 00:26:01,969
Those words

450
00:26:01,969 --> 00:26:04,020
are skillfully worded by 4th Brother.

451
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:06,467
Stop messing around with me.

452
00:26:06,838 --> 00:26:08,013
Quickly, help me think

453
00:26:09,687 --> 00:26:10,861
and see if

454
00:26:10,861 --> 00:26:13,275
there's a way for me to survive in this dangerous position.

455
00:26:13,674 --> 00:26:16,164
4th Brother, aren't you being too dramatic here?

456
00:26:16,832 --> 00:26:18,332
Even if Crown Prince doesn't respect the monk,

457
00:26:18,332 --> 00:26:19,993
he has to respect Buddha. (idiom)

458
00:26:19,993 --> 00:26:21,638
At least, he will order his people

459
00:26:21,638 --> 00:26:23,217
to restrain themselves.

460
00:26:23,217 --> 00:26:24,971
The current problem isn't the Crown Prince,

461
00:26:24,971 --> 00:26:26,657
it's 9th Brother.

462
00:26:32,685 --> 00:26:35,072
This is all 9th Brother's doing for these past few years.

463
00:26:35,072 --> 00:26:36,667
Although I knew some government officials

464
00:26:36,667 --> 00:26:38,728
would often give 9th Brother benefits,

465
00:26:38,728 --> 00:26:40,003
I just didn't think that

466
00:26:40,003 --> 00:26:41,529
the money he took from corrupted officials

467
00:26:41,529 --> 00:26:43,408
was much more than I imagined.

468
00:26:47,143 --> 00:26:48,670
Then do we

469
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:51,885
know how to handle this account book?

470
00:26:51,885 --> 00:26:54,725
I need to trouble you to run an errand this time.

Timing and subtitles brought to you by the Bu Bu Jing Xin Team @ Viki.com

472
00:27:02,193 --> 00:27:03,918
Bei'le Ye,

473
00:27:03,918 --> 00:27:05,606
before we return home,

474
00:27:05,606 --> 00:27:08,857
why don't we burn some incense?

475
00:27:08,857 --> 00:27:11,325
Today is what special day?

476
00:27:13,492 --> 00:27:15,049
Nothing.

477
00:27:15,049 --> 00:27:17,200
Suddenly, I just feel like

478
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,236
going to the temple to pray.

479
00:27:21,823 --> 00:27:23,641
Is it because Imperial Father is investigating

480
00:27:23,641 --> 00:27:26,009
the incident of the relief fund he gave to Fujian that was not properly used?

481
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:29,214
I know that regarding events in Imperial Court,

482
00:27:29,214 --> 00:27:31,757
I shouldn't give my opinion.

483
00:27:31,757 --> 00:27:34,033
But 9th Brother...

484
00:27:35,392 --> 00:27:37,098
But 9th Brother...

485
00:27:37,098 --> 00:27:39,923
I'm afraid he will bring trouble for Bei'le.

486
00:27:39,923 --> 00:27:42,167
Don't worry too much.

487
00:27:42,167 --> 00:27:44,196
Bei'le Ye,

488
00:27:44,196 --> 00:27:45,307
those people...

489
00:27:45,307 --> 00:27:47,286
why do they team up with 9th Brother?

490
00:27:47,286 --> 00:27:49,197
You know the reasons

491
00:27:49,197 --> 00:27:51,294
aren't because of 9th Brother

492
00:27:51,294 --> 00:27:52,930
and his actions,

493
00:27:52,930 --> 00:27:56,570
but because of the relationship between you and him.

494
00:27:56,570 --> 00:27:58,982
However, 9th Brother used your influence

495
00:27:58,982 --> 00:28:37,886
and accepted bribes everywhere.

496
00:28:37,886 --> 00:28:39,454
If I'm not mistaken,

497
00:28:39,454 --> 00:28:40,661
this book

498
00:28:40,661 --> 00:28:42,844
was given to us by 4th Brother.

499
00:28:43,635 --> 00:28:45,302
I don't understand;

500
00:28:45,302 --> 00:28:47,867
if the details inside are related to 9th Brother's dealings,

501
00:28:47,867 --> 00:28:50,728
why didn't 4th brother give it to Imperial Father?

502
00:28:50,728 --> 00:28:52,246
For one, he can get the credit.

503
00:28:52,246 --> 00:28:53,093
Secondly,

504
00:28:53,093 --> 00:28:55,044
he could strike a blow against us.

505
00:28:55,044 --> 00:28:57,751
Why did 4th Brother act contrary to logic?

506
00:28:57,751 --> 00:28:59,455
But this book, in 4th Brother's hands,

507
00:28:59,455 --> 00:29:01,695
is a hot potato.

508
00:29:01,695 --> 00:29:03,285
How should I put it?

509
00:29:04,582 --> 00:29:08,711
Indeed, 4th Brother could have given 9th Brother's accounts to Imperial Father to await punishment.

510
00:29:08,711 --> 00:29:10,787
But at the same time, he must risk

511
00:29:10,787 --> 00:29:12,598
being reprimanded by Imperial Father,

512
00:29:12,598 --> 00:29:15,261
for not caring about brotherly ties.

513
00:29:15,261 --> 00:29:16,992
Your words

514
00:29:16,992 --> 00:29:19,673
sound reasonable.

515
00:29:19,673 --> 00:29:21,403
But this time 4th Brother

516
00:29:21,403 --> 00:29:22,968
has been ordered to assist the Crown Prince

517
00:29:22,968 --> 00:29:26,394
in investigating the Fujian officials' fraud case.

518
00:29:26,394 --> 00:29:28,262
If he doesn't report what he knows,

519
00:29:28,262 --> 00:29:30,320
his reputation could be affected.

520
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,638
Is not 4th Brother

521
00:29:31,638 --> 00:29:33,857
scared that people may say that he is covering up?

522
00:29:33,857 --> 00:29:35,303
That's right.

523
00:29:35,303 --> 00:29:37,436
So by passing this hot potato

524
00:29:37,436 --> 00:29:38,504
of 9th Brother's,

525
00:29:38,504 --> 00:29:40,590
is the more appropriate thing for him to do.

526
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:41,876
At the same time,

527
00:29:41,876 --> 00:29:44,252
if 9th Brother's men exercise restraint,

528
00:29:44,252 --> 00:29:45,624
the Crown Prince's faction

529
00:29:45,624 --> 00:29:48,510
won't be able to continue to gain benefits.

530
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:52,713
In that way, the Crown Prince won't be able to continue protecting his men without any scruples.

531
00:29:52,713 --> 00:29:55,381
4th Brother is providing assistance on the surface,

532
00:29:55,381 --> 00:29:57,489
but his actual role is keeping the Crown Prince in check.

533
00:29:57,489 --> 00:29:58,843
His job has been made so much easier and he still stands to gain.

534
00:30:00,106 --> 00:30:02,394
This drastic maneuver of 4th Brother

535
00:30:02,394 --> 00:30:04,514
is really a master stroke.

536
00:30:04,514 --> 00:30:07,843
I have to really hand it to him.

537
00:30:07,843 --> 00:30:10,105
However, I, on the other hand,

538
00:30:10,105 --> 00:30:12,330
really admire your thought process.

539
00:30:12,330 --> 00:30:15,065
Your thinking is more incisive than what I would have imagined.

540
00:30:15,065 --> 00:30:17,164
4th Brother's every movement,

541
00:30:17,164 --> 00:30:19,617
you know like the back of your hand.

542
00:30:19,617 --> 00:30:22,604
You're all intelligent people.

543
00:30:22,604 --> 00:30:26,859
Both of you are really intelligent but are on opposing sides.

544
00:30:26,859 --> 00:30:29,674
Too bad we were born into the royal family.

545
00:30:29,674 --> 00:30:31,908
Otherwise, if the two of you joined forces,

546
00:30:31,908 --> 00:30:33,555
in whatever matters arose,

547
00:30:33,555 --> 00:30:36,549
I believe success would be guaranteed.

548
00:30:38,178 --> 00:30:39,246
Eighth Brother,

549
00:30:39,246 --> 00:30:40,964
can you promise me one thing?

550
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:44,983
If one day you are the ruler of the court,

551
00:30:44,983 --> 00:30:47,357
can you let 4th Brother retire quietly

552
00:30:47,357 --> 00:30:49,175
to lead a life of leisure away from all courtly affairs?

553
00:30:51,101 --> 00:30:55,877
If you ask 4th Brother the same question,

554
00:30:55,877 --> 00:30:59,620
what do you think his answer would be?

555
00:31:13,238 --> 00:31:15,957
9th Prince, this month,

556
00:31:15,957 --> 00:31:18,035
we hit the jackpot.

557
00:31:18,035 --> 00:31:19,850
The money everyone else is scared to accept

558
00:31:19,850 --> 00:31:22,726
has come to us now.

559
00:31:22,726 --> 00:31:24,037
Come on, everyone,

560
00:31:24,037 --> 00:31:27,063
let's toast to 9th Prince for this.

561
00:31:27,063 --> 00:31:28,867
Here, 9th, here.

562
00:31:28,867 --> 00:31:33,789
Cheers.

563
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:44,213
You fellows listen to me carefully now.

564
00:31:44,213 --> 00:31:45,971
Starting from today,

565
00:31:45,971 --> 00:31:47,946
all of the summer bribes, winter bribes,

566
00:31:47,946 --> 00:31:49,375
and any other bribes...

567
00:31:49,375 --> 00:31:51,390
you must reject them all.

568
00:31:52,281 --> 00:31:54,573
9th Prince,

569
00:31:54,573 --> 00:31:57,288
how about we just be more careful about it?

570
00:31:57,288 --> 00:32:00,335
- That's right, that's right.
- The Crown Prince's men are accepting them too.

571
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:02,968
If we end up getting caught,

572
00:32:02,968 --> 00:32:04,929
won't they...

573
00:32:04,929 --> 00:32:07,087
won't they also get in trouble?

574
00:32:07,087 --> 00:32:08,643
- That's true.
- Right?

575
00:32:08,643 --> 00:32:09,618
Even if it's death,

576
00:32:09,618 --> 00:32:11,290
it won't be on us alone.

577
00:32:11,290 --> 00:32:13,522
Is that correct?

578
00:32:13,522 --> 00:32:15,469
Then is what I'm saying wrong?

579
00:32:17,684 --> 00:32:19,170
That's not it, Ninth Prince.

580
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:22,464
What I'm saying is, boldly tread in this world,

581
00:32:22,464 --> 00:32:24,957
instead of carefully inching along.

582
00:32:24,957 --> 00:32:27,111
Am I right, everybody?

583
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:29,680
- Right, right, right!
-  You got that right!

584
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:34,254
The houses that the Crown Prince's men are living in are getting bigger and bigger, but what about us?

585
00:32:34,254 --> 00:32:35,740
We...

586
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:38,048
When we see the Crown Prince's men,

587
00:32:38,048 --> 00:32:42,419
- we don't dare to lift our heads up high.
- That's right!

588
00:32:42,419 --> 00:32:47,081
9th Prince, a skinny dog is an embarrassment to its owner.

589
00:32:47,081 --> 00:32:49,031
That's right, Ninth Prince.

590
00:32:49,031 --> 00:32:49,672
Are you done talking?

591
00:32:49,672 --> 00:32:54,316
Ninth Prince, we...

592
00:32:54,316 --> 00:32:56,038
All of you, get out!

593
00:32:56,038 --> 00:32:59,017
Get out!

594
00:32:59,017 --> 00:33:01,940
Let's go, go, go!

595
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:04,476
Wretched slaves!

596
00:33:04,476 --> 00:33:09,284
Do you think that one account book can stop me!

597
00:33:09,284 --> 00:33:11,745
If it weren't for Eighth Prince,

598
00:33:11,745 --> 00:33:15,121
I wouldn't have you fellows looking down on me!

599
00:33:32,479 --> 00:33:35,087
Buns for sale.

600
00:33:35,087 --> 00:33:38,295
Hot steaming buns.

601
00:33:41,574 --> 00:33:43,271
Buns for sale.

602
00:33:43,271 --> 00:33:46,608
Fresh from the oven.

603
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:52,320
Buns for sale.

604
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:55,270
Buns for sale.

605
00:33:55,270 --> 00:34:00,386
Fresh from the oven.

606
00:34:00,386 --> 00:34:02,840
Boss, come and buy two buns.

607
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:04,858
All right.

608
00:34:12,417 --> 00:34:13,761
4th Brother, 13th Brother.

609
00:34:13,761 --> 00:34:15,243
No need to see me off.

610
00:34:15,243 --> 00:34:17,139
Godspeed, Crown Prince.

611
00:34:40,257 --> 00:34:42,614
9th Brother, since Imperial Father

612
00:34:42,614 --> 00:34:43,568
didn't say anything,

613
00:34:43,568 --> 00:34:44,456
then isn't that to say

614
00:34:44,456 --> 00:34:47,469
4th Brother didn't report everything he found out?

615
00:34:47,469 --> 00:34:48,816
So should I

616
00:34:48,816 --> 00:34:51,827
bow to him in gratitude?

617
00:34:51,827 --> 00:34:54,217
You are all afraid of him. I'm not!

618
00:34:54,217 --> 00:34:55,478
Ninth.

619
00:35:01,272 --> 00:35:03,180
8th Brother will handle the matter.

620
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:04,905
Please don't create more trouble.

621
00:35:22,931 --> 00:35:25,717
Fourth Prince, it's done.

622
00:35:30,370 --> 00:35:34,216
Thirteenth, come and see Ninth's account.

623
00:35:36,863 --> 00:35:39,514
He still doesn't know how to cover up.

624
00:35:39,514 --> 00:35:42,282
What do we do?

625
00:35:42,282 --> 00:35:44,951
Arrange a meeting with 8th Brother.

626
00:35:58,313 --> 00:35:59,456
4th Brother.

627
00:35:59,456 --> 00:36:01,496
8th Brother.

628
00:36:01,496 --> 00:36:04,093
I'm returning this account book to you.

629
00:36:04,093 --> 00:36:06,215
Although 9th brother may sometimes do the wrong thing,

630
00:36:06,215 --> 00:36:08,165
he will learn his lesson in the end.

631
00:36:08,165 --> 00:36:10,223
He won't let you down.

632
00:36:11,143 --> 00:36:13,504
I have always thought that 9th Brother listens to you the most,

633
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:15,962
but I realized I was wrong.

634
00:36:15,962 --> 00:36:17,748
9th Brother is obstinate and opinionated.

635
00:36:17,748 --> 00:36:19,163
He has an unbending nature.

636
00:36:19,163 --> 00:36:21,392
In whatever he does, he doesn't think about the consequences.

637
00:36:22,204 --> 00:36:24,001
If he has offended you in any way,

638
00:36:24,001 --> 00:36:26,184
please allow me to act on his behalf

639
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:29,317
and apologize to you.

640
00:36:29,317 --> 00:36:30,796
Before yesterday,

641
00:36:30,796 --> 00:36:33,025
I wanted to let bygones be bygones,

642
00:36:33,025 --> 00:36:34,325
but now I've encountered

643
00:36:34,325 --> 00:36:35,533
an even trickier problem.

644
00:36:35,533 --> 00:36:37,576
I hope to get some suggestions from you.

645
00:36:38,651 --> 00:36:41,020
If Fourth Brother can't deal with this difficult problem,

646
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:44,638
I think I'll be of no help to you.

647
00:36:44,638 --> 00:36:45,914
Bring the accounts over.

648
00:36:45,914 --> 00:36:48,072
Yes.

649
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:13,215
Is this the difficult problem that 4th Brother was referring to?

650
00:37:13,215 --> 00:37:17,295
I can't compare with 4th Brother, in regards to taking charge.

651
00:37:17,295 --> 00:37:19,774
May I ask you something?

652
00:37:19,774 --> 00:37:21,478
4th Brother, have you only investigated

653
00:37:21,478 --> 00:37:24,257
9th Brother's muddled accounts?

654
00:37:24,257 --> 00:37:26,150
8th Brother, you're the kind that understands

655
00:37:26,150 --> 00:37:28,776
that I do what I have to do.

656
00:37:28,776 --> 00:37:30,480
Imperial Father has ordered a thorough investigation.

657
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,609
Everyone in court has exercised restraint,

658
00:37:32,609 --> 00:37:34,070
including the Crown Prince.

659
00:37:35,185 --> 00:37:36,950
Only 9th Brother hasn't.

660
00:37:43,289 --> 00:37:45,871
4th Brother has the Imperial order.

661
00:37:45,871 --> 00:37:50,208
However you need to handle it, you'll handle it.

662
00:37:55,542 --> 00:37:56,570
I just don't believe

663
00:37:56,570 --> 00:37:58,449
Old Fourth can do whatever he wants with me!

664
00:37:58,449 --> 00:38:00,796
Don't think just because he's got the Crown Prince  supporting him,

665
00:38:00,796 --> 00:38:04,140
he can do whatever he wants and disregard everyone else!

666
00:38:09,504 --> 00:38:11,663
Are you all mute?

667
00:38:15,988 --> 00:38:18,685
Eighth Brother, what should I do?

668
00:38:18,685 --> 00:38:19,999
Tell me what to do.

669
00:38:22,252 --> 00:38:23,552
If you want me to get rid of 4th Brother,

670
00:38:23,552 --> 00:38:26,631
I will go out right now with a knife!

671
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:34,442
Eighth Brother, say something.

672
00:38:43,378 --> 00:38:46,097
14th, I know that

673
00:38:46,097 --> 00:38:47,694
4th and you have the same mother.

674
00:38:47,694 --> 00:38:49,233
You won't say anything.

675
00:38:49,233 --> 00:38:50,712
But think about it,

676
00:38:50,712 --> 00:38:51,648
does 4th consider you

677
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:53,699
to be that close?

678
00:39:02,288 --> 00:39:04,892
10th, you usually don't have an opinion.

679
00:39:04,892 --> 00:39:05,961
But today,

680
00:39:05,961 --> 00:39:07,593
no matter what, you must say something!

681
00:39:07,593 --> 00:39:08,954
What do you think I should do?

682
00:39:12,305 --> 00:39:14,652
9th Brother, I'm not criticizing you.

683
00:39:14,652 --> 00:39:16,517
8th Brother asked you earlier on to stop.

684
00:39:16,517 --> 00:39:17,896
But you didn't listen.

685
00:39:17,896 --> 00:39:20,153
And 4th brother gave 8th brother another document.

686
00:39:20,153 --> 00:39:23,383
If you're not criticizing me, what are you doing right now?!

687
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:28,777
8th Brother.

688
00:39:28,777 --> 00:39:32,465
Is there any other way?

689
00:39:32,465 --> 00:39:34,126
I've already asked 4th brother

690
00:39:34,126 --> 00:39:37,756
to deliver the accounts to our Imperial Father.

691
00:39:37,756 --> 00:39:40,524
8th brother, what are you saying?

692
00:39:40,524 --> 00:39:42,175
I've done all I can.

693
00:39:42,175 --> 00:39:43,707
You've done your best?

694
00:39:43,707 --> 00:39:45,343
This is called doing your best!

695
00:39:45,343 --> 00:39:46,951
I see you're doing your best to save yourself!

696
00:39:46,951 --> 00:39:48,222
9th Brother.

697
00:39:48,222 --> 00:39:49,877
How can you say that to 8th Brother?

698
00:39:49,877 --> 00:39:53,395
Am I wrong?!

699
00:39:53,395 --> 00:39:56,641
Yes! I have only myself to blame!

700
00:39:56,641 --> 00:39:58,986
I thought that

701
00:39:58,986 --> 00:40:01,029
we were all in the same boat.

702
00:40:01,029 --> 00:40:04,373
But before the storm comes, everyone has already abandoned the ship!

703
00:40:04,373 --> 00:40:06,602
Fine! Don't worry.

704
00:40:06,602 --> 00:40:08,831
No matter what Imperial Father will do to me,

705
00:40:08,831 --> 00:40:11,037
I won't let any of you be implicated!

706
00:40:11,037 --> 00:40:12,291
Calm down!

707
00:40:12,291 --> 00:40:13,824
How do you want me to calm down?!

708
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:14,845
Think about it.

709
00:40:14,845 --> 00:40:17,074
What would you do if you were 8th Brother?

710
00:40:17,074 --> 00:40:19,211
Even if 8th Brother asks 4th Brother to cover up,

711
00:40:19,211 --> 00:40:21,161
4th Brother might not do it.

712
00:40:21,161 --> 00:40:23,065
In the end, he will have to suffer people's gossip.

713
00:40:23,065 --> 00:40:24,040
8th Brother,

714
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:25,526
you have really miscalculated your move.

715
00:40:25,526 --> 00:40:27,913
If only at that time the account books had been burnt to ashes,

716
00:40:27,913 --> 00:40:29,567
then 4th Brother wouldn't have had any evidence.

717
00:40:29,567 --> 00:40:32,346
10th, just go home.

718
00:40:32,346 --> 00:40:33,400
How come when I hear you speaking,

719
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:35,568
it sounds so dumb?

720
00:40:35,568 --> 00:40:36,983
What do you mean?

721
00:40:36,983 --> 00:40:38,808
I'm thinking on your behalf.

722
00:40:38,808 --> 00:40:40,269
If you are thinking on my behalf,

723
00:40:40,269 --> 00:40:41,362
then please first go home

724
00:40:41,362 --> 00:40:42,356
and bring back your brain!

725
00:40:42,356 --> 00:40:44,556
Then think again about a way to help me!

726
00:40:44,556 --> 00:40:46,624
Your words sound so awful.

727
00:40:46,624 --> 00:40:48,453
At home, I suffer with Ming Yu's temper!

728
00:40:48,453 --> 00:40:50,109
Now I have to suffer with yours!

729
00:40:50,109 --> 00:40:50,824
I...

730
00:40:50,824 --> 00:40:52,231
Was I born to suffer from both your tempers?

731
00:40:52,231 --> 00:40:53,692
Stop arguing!

732
00:40:56,479 --> 00:40:58,218
No matter what.

733
00:40:58,218 --> 00:41:00,262
I'm a man.

734
00:41:00,262 --> 00:41:02,423
I will follow through with what I said.

735
00:41:02,423 --> 00:41:04,813
- You--
- Don't worry.

736
00:41:04,813 --> 00:41:07,453
As long as that corrupt Crown Prince is still around,

737
00:41:07,453 --> 00:41:09,378
even if I have to die,

738
00:41:09,378 --> 00:41:10,318
he will fall right along with me.

739
00:41:16,290 --> 00:41:17,887
The Crown Prince's men

740
00:41:17,887 --> 00:41:19,806
have already curbed their excesses.

741
00:41:21,234 --> 00:41:23,158
You don't need to panic about losing your head.

742
00:41:23,158 --> 00:41:27,663
Imperial Father won't do anything to you.

743
00:41:54,505 --> 00:41:56,981
So these are the so-called Pillars of the State,

744
00:41:58,288 --> 00:42:01,585
the country's foundations.

745
00:42:08,098 --> 00:42:12,724
This incident is thus concluded.

746
00:42:12,724 --> 00:42:16,085
The people involved in this case are exempted from questioning.

747
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:19,536
Their sentence will be limited to making compensation.

748
00:42:22,332 --> 00:42:23,948
Everyone is dismissed!

749
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:26,061
I will take my leave.

750
00:42:26,061 --> 00:42:28,072
- We will take our leave.
- We will take our leave.

751
00:42:58,499 --> 00:43:02,888
Ruoxi, come up.

752
00:43:11,636 --> 00:43:13,873
Greetings 4th Prince, greetings 13th Prince.

753
00:43:13,873 --> 00:43:15,171
Rise.

754
00:43:18,620 --> 00:43:21,371
Why aren't you two seeking shelter from the rain?

755
00:43:21,371 --> 00:43:24,961
Ruoxi, why don't you tell me?

756
00:43:24,961 --> 00:43:26,912
With regards to officials who are corrupt and abuse the law,

757
00:43:26,912 --> 00:43:29,384
how should they be handled?

758
00:43:29,384 --> 00:43:31,123
I am just a palace maid,

759
00:43:31,123 --> 00:43:32,935
how would I know what should be done?

760
00:43:32,935 --> 00:43:35,010
13th Prince, please don't have a joke at my expense.

761
00:43:35,010 --> 00:43:36,603
Don't try to fool me.

762
00:43:36,603 --> 00:43:38,479
What is going on in your mind,

763
00:43:38,479 --> 00:43:41,315
I think I roughly know.

764
00:43:41,315 --> 00:43:43,337
Since ancient times the word "corruption"

765
00:43:43,337 --> 00:43:45,209
has always been followed by "abuse of the law."

766
00:43:45,209 --> 00:43:47,828
It's true that stealing the people's blood, sweat, and tears is abominable,

767
00:43:47,828 --> 00:43:49,128
but what is more detestable is

768
00:43:49,128 --> 00:43:50,503
abuse of the law.

769
00:43:50,503 --> 00:43:52,061
For the love of money,

770
00:43:52,061 --> 00:43:53,740
the people at the top and bottom collaborate with each other.

771
00:43:53,740 --> 00:43:56,076
Mutual cover-ups, no justice is upheld.

772
00:43:56,076 --> 00:43:58,291
This is even more harmful to human life.

773
00:43:58,291 --> 00:44:00,866
There will always be people using underhanded means to achieve their aims.

774
00:44:00,866 --> 00:44:03,167
Stop talking in circles, answer the question directly.

775
00:44:06,952 --> 00:44:08,761
Strict punishment with no leniency.

776
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:11,642
A moment of tolerance leads to

777
00:44:11,642 --> 00:44:13,175
a rise in corruption.

778
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:14,972
Poor governance

779
00:44:14,972 --> 00:44:16,890
is even more scary than corruption.

780
00:44:16,890 --> 00:44:18,608
If officials don't behave like officials,

781
00:44:18,608 --> 00:44:19,955
the ordinary people will have no way of making a living.

782
00:44:19,955 --> 00:44:22,645
Naturally, they won't behave like citizens anymore.

783
00:44:26,909 --> 00:44:28,500
If I said to you,

784
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:30,195
the crime was committed by Ninth Brother,

785
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:32,331
then what should be done?

786
00:44:33,887 --> 00:44:36,089
Then whatever needs to be done should be done.

787
00:44:36,089 --> 00:44:38,424
Do you really believe

788
00:44:38,424 --> 00:44:40,389
a prince should undergo the same punishment as a commoner?

789
00:44:41,380 --> 00:44:43,486
The money that was made legitimate by him should be returned.

790
00:44:43,486 --> 00:44:44,825
Punish him with a few beatings of the plank,

791
00:44:44,825 --> 00:44:46,651
so that he won't be able to get out of bed for six months.

792
00:44:46,651 --> 00:44:49,073
And then send him to the streets to be a beggar for three months.

793
00:44:49,073 --> 00:44:51,441
Let him experience how the poor have to get through their days.

794
00:44:51,441 --> 00:44:54,100
Henceforth, he will know what's it like to be in other people's shoes.

795
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:55,698
With regards to the other offenders,

796
00:44:55,698 --> 00:44:57,409
they should all be severely punished.

797
00:44:57,409 --> 00:44:59,334
Let them serve as a warning to others.

798
00:44:59,334 --> 00:45:00,281
No one will protect

799
00:45:00,281 --> 00:45:03,878
people who violate the law. In the future,

800
00:45:03,878 --> 00:45:07,197
those corrupt officials won't dare to be greedy anymore.

801
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:09,655
To think that you can come up with such an idea.

802
00:45:09,655 --> 00:45:11,945
You are not sparing a thought for your brother-in-law.

803
00:45:12,740 --> 00:45:13,732
In this matter,

804
00:45:13,732 --> 00:45:15,706
wasn't the 9th Prince implicated?

805
00:45:15,706 --> 00:45:17,006
Not as of yet.

806
00:45:17,006 --> 00:45:18,832
Today, Imperial Father said

807
00:45:18,832 --> 00:45:20,289
to stop questioning the officials involved.

808
00:45:20,289 --> 00:45:21,776
Their punishment is to return the money.

809
00:45:21,776 --> 00:45:23,555
Their punishment is to return the money.

810
00:45:24,065 --> 00:45:25,312
The Emperor only wants

811
00:45:25,312 --> 00:45:26,805
the money to be returned?

812
00:45:27,897 --> 00:45:29,220
In the accounts,

813
00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:31,565
the amount is over 400 thousand taels of silver.

814
00:45:31,565 --> 00:45:34,870
A plot of land is worth only about 7 to 8 taels of silver.

815
00:45:34,870 --> 00:45:36,502
A tael of silver

816
00:45:36,502 --> 00:45:38,106
is enough to support an ordinary family of five

817
00:45:38,106 --> 00:45:39,414
for one month.

818
00:45:40,319 --> 00:45:41,736
It's about 2 million people's

819
00:45:41,736 --> 00:45:43,143
one month's food supply.

820
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:46,903
This matter has been settled already.

821
00:45:46,903 --> 00:45:48,400
There's no use thinking of it any longer.

822
00:45:57,091 --> 00:45:58,431
Where's Fourth Brother?

823
00:45:58,431 --> 00:46:00,188
All of the sudden I don't see a trace of him.

824
00:46:00,188 --> 00:46:02,478
Aren't I here?

825
00:46:02,478 --> 00:46:04,222
In a while, I'm meeting a beautiful lady for a romantic liaison.

826
00:46:04,222 --> 00:46:05,397
This rain shows no signs of stopping.

827
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:08,778
I won't be able to accompany you two anymore.

828
00:46:08,778 --> 00:46:10,273
I'll be taking my leave first.

829
00:46:21,790 --> 00:46:24,121
Actually, since you came back from the expedition, I wanted to give this to you.

830
00:46:24,121 --> 00:46:26,759
But so many things happened, so the gift has been delayed.

831
00:46:28,176 --> 00:46:29,871
I can't accept this.

832
00:46:31,078 --> 00:46:32,262
14th Brother.

833
00:46:34,448 --> 00:46:35,542
You tricked me.

834
00:46:35,542 --> 00:46:37,310
Who would've thought that would work?

835
00:46:37,310 --> 00:46:39,028
You're that afraid of 14th Brother?

836
00:46:39,028 --> 00:46:40,343
I'm not afraid.

837
00:46:42,479 --> 00:46:44,012
If you follow me out of here,

838
00:46:44,012 --> 00:46:45,776
14th Brother may see you.

839
