[Episode 7]

4
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:38,390
Things General likes are

5
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:39,850
practicing martial arts,

6
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:40,650
calligraphy,

7
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:41,720
playing chess,

8
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:43,390
braised pork joint,

9
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:44,420
and noodles.

10
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:49,960
What annoys him is

11
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:51,820
singing and dancing performances,

12
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:54,690
and too much nonsense from his subordinates.

13
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:00,420
Know yourself and your enemy,

14
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:02,150
and you will never be defeated.

15
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:09,990
Master,

16
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:11,160
I'm done.

17
00:01:12,289 --> 00:01:13,420
As you instructed,

18
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:14,650
I've cleaned every corner

19
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:16,230
of the yard.

20
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:17,890
Nice job.

21
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:18,820
Go back.

22
00:01:19,289 --> 00:01:19,990
Master,

23
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,750
Are you sure doing all of these things

24
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:24,690
will help me become a courageous person?

25
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:26,250
Could it be

26
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:30,150
you're taking the chance to ask me to do chores for you?

27
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:31,760
Hey,

28
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:34,150
how could you think of me in that way?

29
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:37,490
I asked you about General's likes and dislikes

30
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:39,990
to test your observation ability.

31
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:41,890
I asked you to clean up

32
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:44,320
to work on your strength and patience.

33
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:51,259
Why do you want to

34
00:01:51,259 --> 00:01:53,320
make yourself a more capable person?

35
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:55,090
Of course, to become General's

36
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:56,390
right-hand man

37
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:57,460
like my father.

38
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:03,260
I see.

39
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,160
Things you ask me to do

40
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,750
are all about General.

41
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:09,590
You want me to be clearer about the goal in my heart.

42
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:11,260
That's right!

43
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,990
You're smart.

44
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:16,020
The first thing to do

45
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:17,880
is to overcome your fear of blood.

46
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:19,290
Go to Butcher Liu of Andu City

47
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:21,290
to cut a piece of

48
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:23,120
marbled meat

49
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:26,550
tomorrow morning.

50
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:28,490
Master, don't worry.

51
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:29,960
I promise to get it done.

52
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:31,020
Go.

53
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:31,829
Yes.

54
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:40,850
The second step to winning a man's heart

55
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:42,960
is to make him feel a sense of home warmth

56
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,190
and give him care.

57
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:46,030
Lie Yun,

58
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:47,420
I guess my care

59
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:49,890
is enough to unfreeze your face.

60
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:02,690
General,

61
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:04,250
if the martial arts classes

62
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:06,150
get widely carried out in the country,

63
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:09,010
then the shortage of good soldiers won't bother us.

64
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:11,250
We can't expect short-term effects,

65
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:12,660
but in the long run,

66
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:15,320
this will surely make our country stronger.

67
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:17,060
In addition to martial arts,

68
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,320
we'll also teach children military law,

69
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,550
to combine them.

70
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:21,390
I've reported this to His Majesty,

71
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:23,120
waiting for his adjudication.

72
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:41,360
Xiao Tong,

73
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:43,890
have you found

74
00:03:44,329 --> 00:03:46,360
some differences in the room?

75
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:51,990
I feel

76
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:53,560
it's cozier.

77
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:27,890
I've cleaned

78
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:30,090
the room

79
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:30,720
and

80
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:33,490
get it slightly decorated.

81
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:36,630
The food

82
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,920
is put in the box.

83
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:41,090
Drinking tea

84
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:44,020
and bathing water

85
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,020
are all done.

86
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:50,790
General,

87
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,020
you've had a day.

88
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:55,060
Sweet dream.

89
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:57,650
An Chen.

90
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,240
[An Chen]

91
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:02,460
This An Chen

92
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:03,750
is good at flattery.

93
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:11,350
There's something

94
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:13,430
I've been suspicious

95
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:17,510
and I need to be confirmed.

96
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:27,820
An Chen,

97
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:29,790
why are you slacking off again?

98
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:31,550
General's calling you in the study.

99
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:32,760
But you're here sleeping.

100
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:33,590
Get up and do your chores!

101
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:35,250
Shoes, shoes, and my clothes.

102
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:37,790
Shake a leg.

103
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:39,490
Hurry up!

104
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:01,290
You're too slow.

105
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:02,390
General's gone.

106
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:04,090
Clean up the room.

107
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:04,950
Be quick!

108
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:05,390
I...

109
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:05,960
You...

110
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:18,090
Mei's really something.

111
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:22,590
Looks like they believe me now.

112
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:30,060
My gold.

113
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:31,260
I'm coming!

114
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:39,030
Getting rich.

115
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:05,220
This woman.

116
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:07,590
Interesting.

117
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:12,090
Oh, forget it.

118
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:13,750
I'd better find things first.

119
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:42,789
General,

120
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,550
why are you here?

121
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:47,420
What are you doing?

122
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:50,060
I...

123
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:57,290
Actually, I was looking for something.

124
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:06,820
What are you looking for?

125
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:14,590
Forgive me, please.

126
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:16,080
As a matter of fact,

127
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:17,860
I lied to you.

128
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:22,390
What's that about?

129
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:28,090
Well,

130
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:31,220
I'm not just admiring you.

131
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:32,390
I wanna

132
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:33,650
get close to you

133
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:35,550
and know more about you.

134
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,590
I want to know what you read.

135
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:40,360
I was born in a poor family

136
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:41,950
without accepting a decent education.

137
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:43,390
But as your attendant,

138
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:45,250
I can't make a fool of myself.

139
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:46,920
If one day

140
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,450
you dump me after finding out I'm uneducated,

141
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,160
then I can't be there for you.

142
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:52,430
So

143
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:53,490
I decided to

144
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,530
improve myself secretly.

145
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:00,320
That's why I'm here to look for a book to read.

146
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:24,090
Go to cook.

147
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:24,990
All right!
