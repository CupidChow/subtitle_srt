[Episode 27]

4
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:36,790
Give me!

5
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:43,190
The map is here.

6
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:45,250
But I need to see An Chen first.

7
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:52,890
You are just like your father,

8
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:54,530
spoony,

9
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:57,450
but stupid.

10
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:01,920
How do you know

11
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:03,750
anything about my father?

12
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:07,860
Do you remember your gentle and beautiful Aunt Xiang?

13
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,350
She is

14
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:12,860
my father's sister,

15
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:14,930
the best spy who had

16
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:17,390
hidden in Rui Kingdom for decades.

17
00:01:18,789 --> 00:01:19,890
Unfortunately,

18
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:21,820
the stupid woman

19
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:23,890
killed your father soon

20
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,460
lest he would suffer.

21
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:30,590
Not only didn't she get the map,

22
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:32,560
but she also suffered from the poison insect

23
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,990
of the Venom Moon Sect for three days and nights.

24
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:36,890
You people trifle with others' affections

25
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:38,150
by dirty means.

26
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:41,050
In the end, she brought trouble to herself.

27
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:41,890
Indeed.

28
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,320
That's why people

29
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,920
shouldn't fall in love,

30
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,560
or they'll have a soft spot.

31
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,020
Once they have a soft spot,

32
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:52,660
their lives are in others' hands.

33
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:58,390
General Lie used to be

34
00:01:58,690 --> 00:01:59,990
a firm and resolute god of war

35
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:02,990
on the battlefield.

36
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:04,650
Now,

37
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:07,590
he has to beg of me

38
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:09,220
because of a woman.

39
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,520
Cut the crap!

40
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:13,520
Let An Chen go.

41
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:23,720
What?

42
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:26,460
Don't you want her?

43
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:29,990
If you dare to touch me,

44
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:33,530
I'll let her suffer ten times more.

45
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:51,730
Let An Chen go.

46
00:02:56,890 --> 00:02:58,160
I finally got it.

47
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:00,390
I finally got it.

48
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:36,590
An Chen,

49
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:39,350
I'll let you watch the man you love

50
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:40,920
die in front of you.

51
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:13,260
Leave. It's a trap!

52
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:15,660
I told you

53
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:18,920
once people fell in love, they would have a soft spot.

54
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:22,150
You don't deserve to be my match anymore.

55
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:35,659
Lie Yun, Lie Yun, are you OK?

56
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:36,390
Blood!

57
00:04:36,659 --> 00:04:37,290
Lie Yun!

58
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:38,290
Lie Yun!

59
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:42,920
Lie Yun!

60
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:44,659
An Chen!

61
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:47,159
I'll see which of you

62
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:50,290
can get out of the tomb of love.

63
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,520
Are you all right?

64
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:00,720
Get up.

65
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:35,860
Why are you so silly?

66
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:38,490
Knowing it was a trap, you still came.

67
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,350
I told you to believe me.

68
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:47,090
How can I leave you alone?

69
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:50,750
It isn't worth giving up the map for me.

70
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,860
Why didn't you give him a fake one?

71
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:58,890
Xiang Yao is canny.

72
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,580
He would recognize a fake one.

73
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:05,390
Actually, the map I gave him

74
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:09,390
was both true and fake.

75
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:11,790
The real Deployment Map is

76
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:15,490
a military tactic that runs in the Lie family.

77
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:19,250
We can change the deployment anytime.

78
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:23,090
It's useless even though

79
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,090
he got it.

80
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,790
It's my fault.

81
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:40,159
You've been hurt so badly because of me.

82
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:44,120
If only I didn't take the task!

83
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:52,720
How can I blame you?

84
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:57,920
I'd rather stick together with you

85
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:00,650
in life and death right now

86
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:04,130
than miss out on you.

87
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:12,950
By the way,

88
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,560
where is the sachet?

89
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,650
I've always carried it with me.

90
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:41,590
This is camellia.

91
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,220
It can soothe the pain and stop bleeding.

92
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:45,159
Put up with it.

93
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:56,060
What a pity.

94
00:07:56,690 --> 00:07:57,920
You have to

95
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,360
make a new one when we get back.

96
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:04,460
Fool,

97
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:06,720
why do you care about that?

98
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:08,050
If you like,

99
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,620
I'll make a hundred ones when we get back.

100
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:11,990
OK.

101
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:14,150
A hundred.

102
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:15,920
But,

103
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:20,050
can we still go back?

104
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:21,190
Don't worry.

105
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:24,920
We haven't come to the end.

106
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:28,990
Not until the last moment

107
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:32,289
shall we give up.

108
00:08:34,789 --> 00:08:35,990
The capital

109
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:39,360
used to be a fortress in the early years.

110
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:43,320
Lots of culverts had been built here.

111
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,750
Listen.

112
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:55,330
The sound of water.

113
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,920
There must be an exit.

114
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:02,790
Be careful.

115
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:18,730
Go.

116
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:33,690
Be careful.

117
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:51,690
Let's take a break.

118
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,450
I don't know when the air

119
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:00,390
is going to be

120
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:01,360
exhausted.

121
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:03,530
We can't stop.

122
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,630
Be careful.

123
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:34,360
There it is.

124
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:38,130
There must be an exit behind it.
