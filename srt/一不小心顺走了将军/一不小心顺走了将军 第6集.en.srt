Man?

5
00:01:04,819 --> 00:01:06,690
My good-looking face

6
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:08,550
and hunky body.

7
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:10,890
I knew you'd fall for this.

8
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,360
Mei's right.

9
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:18,920
Mine staying here a day means more danger.

10
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:20,690
It's better for me to finish the mission

15
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:54,950
Vice General Xiao,

16
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:00,130
is this

17
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:01,860
for General's medicated bath?

18
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:03,120
What?

19
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:06,720
When I saw General today,

20
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:08,919
I seemed to catch his red and swollen arms.

21
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:10,150
Mr. Jiang said

22
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:12,290
General just needs a hot compress.

23
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:13,320
Why do you ask?

24
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,560
I'm General's personal attendant.

25
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:16,690
How can I

26
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:18,460
bother you with such a thing?

27
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:19,829
Let me do this.

28
00:02:19,829 --> 00:02:21,090
I got this.

29
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,890
The first step to wiwinning man's heart

30
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:27,350
is to give him the pleasure of being admired.

31
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:28,360
Flatter him

32
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:30,290
as much as I can.

33
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:49,090
Is he

34
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:51,390
really a man?

35
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,250
General.

36
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:01,960
General.

37
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:04,790
What brings you here?

38
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,290
I'm here to

39
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:08,620
apply medicine for you.

40
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:12,060
I see some progress on you.

41
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,050
You're worth teaching.

42
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:20,230
This is the least I can do.

43
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:24,190
General, I saw how brave you were today.

44
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:26,790
There are so many beautiful women here.

45
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,690
You must be worn out.

46
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,690
Your arms got swollen.

47
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:35,860
I know it's my duty to serve you,

48
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:37,630
but...

49
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:38,720
I feel

50
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:40,480
a little bit sorry for you.

51
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:43,250
It's not a big deal.

52
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:43,980
No big deal.

53
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:51,490
You...

54
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,450
learned how to massage?

55
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:55,960
Have I learned it or not?

56
00:03:58,090 --> 00:03:58,590
Oh.

57
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:00,460
I didn't.

58
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,290
When I was

59
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:03,230
appointed as your attendant,

60
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:05,260
I especially learned it,

61
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:07,990
in case that I can help you

62
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:09,420
relieve fatigue

63
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:10,660

64
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:12,290
you're in need.

65
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:18,790
You're so well-prepared.

66
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:21,550
Tell me what you want.

67
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:23,850
I don't want anything.

68
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:25,860
I know you're

69
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:28,590
the god of war who defends our country.

70
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:30,730
Thanks to you,

71
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:33,120
the people can live in peace.

72
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,190
So

73
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:35,520
I just wish you

74
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,750
good health

75
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,090
and a good mood.

76
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,320
Oh.

77
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:42,460
Go on.

78
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,050
I said these from the bottom of my heart, General.

79
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,330
In my heart,

80
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:50,750
you're

81
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:53,590
the big hero.

82
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,390
Ever since I heard your story,

83
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:57,120
I've become your admirer

84
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:59,560
and finally I got a chance to serve you.

85
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:03,590
Happy as I am,

86
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:05,920
I have some concerns.

87
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:06,760
Concern?

88
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:08,250
Why?

89
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:10,960
You're

90
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:12,120
the big hero,

91
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:13,520
and the god of war.

92
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:16,760
But you're so tired.

93
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,960
Our Rui Kingdom only has the Lie's Army,

94
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,720
and puts all the heavy load on your shoulder.

95
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:25,550
It's the blessing of our country to have you.

96
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:26,750
But you're all alone.

97
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:30,150
I'm afraid things might go wrong.

98
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,990
What do you mean?

99
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:35,320
Something will go wrong with you physically.

100
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:38,050
I'm strong. How is it possible?

101
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:39,230
Even without me,

102
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:41,190
the Lie's Army is unbreakable.

103
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:42,760
How can you not be there?

104
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:45,320
But

105
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:49,890
if there are more generals like you in our country,

106
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:52,350
you don't need to work so hard.

107
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:54,150
More generals?

108
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:00,120
How to make that happen?

109
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:06,490
Starts with the children.

110
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:15,090
Kids follow you when you ask them to read.

111
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:16,590
And they'll do martial arts

112
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:17,850
if you ask them to do so.

113
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:19,720
Learning literature alone

114
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:22,250
will make them lose interest in martial arts.

115
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:23,090
If

116
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:24,890
there are martial arts lessons,

117
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:26,530
it's likely

118
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:28,190
some children dream of

119
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:30,390
being a general when they grow up.

120
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:37,990
I gotta say

121
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:41,450
I'm surprised by what you said.

122
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:55,520
This is my personal experience

123
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,850
in Anhun Pavilion!

124
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,490
You must be flattering me for some reason.

125
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:21,090
You've been like a chatterbox since last time.

126
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:23,890
For the sake of the chestnuts,

127
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:25,690
I'm listening.

128
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:26,490
Tell me

129
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:27,930
what you're up to.

130
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:30,690
Attendant An,

131
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:31,720
I want to

132
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,920
take you as my master.

133
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:38,360
You

134
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:40,390
take me as your master?

135
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:42,490
What's wrong with you?

136
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:43,790
I've heard

137
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:45,390
your heroic deeds.

138
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,290
As a big fan of General,

139
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:47,820
you outwitted the assassin

140
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:48,950
and risked your life

141
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:50,659
to save General,

142
00:07:50,659 --> 00:07:53,390
which is why you're promoted as his personal attendant.

143
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:54,560
If I were

144
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:56,350
as a little brave as you,

145
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:57,530
I wouldn't

146
00:07:57,659 --> 00:08:00,660
be stuck here as a mediocre bodyguard.

147
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:01,150
Alas.

148
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:02,190
my father

149
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,450
was the most satisfying right-hand man

150
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:04,920
of the old general.

151
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,960
Because of my father,

152
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,760
I could be kept in the Lie's Army.

153
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:12,350
But I'm such a coward.

154
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:13,520
I dream to be like you

155
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:14,220
who is

156
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:15,520
manly.

157
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:17,490
And I hope I won't chicken out

158
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:18,260
so that I can

159
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:20,160
show filial respect for my father

160
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:20,520
and repay you.

161
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,420
Stop it.

162
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:23,090
Don't get so excited.

163
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:24,920
Let me straighten things out.

164
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,920
You want to learn from me

165
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:28,590
being a man.

166
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,460
There must be

167
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:32,990
something wrong with him.

168
00:08:39,789 --> 00:08:41,090
I promise to work hard

169
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:42,289
to repay you, master.

170
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,350
Well,

171
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:49,350
you come to the right person.

172
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:01,590
Master,

173
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:03,320
please take this!

174
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:06,560
I'll do whatever

175
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,490
you ask as long as

176
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:09,290
you make me a courageous person.

177
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:12,790
Come.

178
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:13,690
Get up.

179
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,380
My apprentice,

180
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:19,050
have you ever fought on the battlefield?

181
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:22,190
No.

182
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:25,990
Hove you ever killed an enemy?

183
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:28,560
No.

184
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:30,590
How about fighting back?

185
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:31,960
You got to fight back

186
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,490
when someone hits you?

187
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:35,930
To my shame,

188
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:37,590
I've always been the one

189
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:39,760
who got bullied ever since childhood.

190
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,550
I never fought back.

191
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:45,290
I used to be General's personal attendant

192
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:46,820
who'd served him for years.

193
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:48,590
There were a few times when he was in danger.

194
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:50,520
I was supposed to save him.

195
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:51,360
But

196
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,330
I was shaking with fear

197
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:55,290
at the sight of the coming enemies.

198
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:56,950
I could barely

199
00:09:56,950 --> 00:09:58,190
keep myself there for him instead of running away,

200
00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:00,590
not to mention protecting him.

201
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:03,460
It was General who got me covered every time

202
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:05,530
so that I can make it through.

203
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,190
I feel unworthy of his patronage.

204
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:10,860
He's so chicken.

205
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:13,120
I can make use of him.

206
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:14,590
Well,

207
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,450
to make a suitable

208
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:18,490
study plan for you,

209
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:19,550
I need to

210
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:22,060
test your observation ability.

211
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:24,990
Tell me

212
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:27,690
things General likes and dislikes.

213
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:28,930
Ah?
