[Episode 11]

4
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:37,760
Specially?

5
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:40,050
Where?

6
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:41,660
That's impossible.

7
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,060
I'll never like him.

8
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:57,250
I just said you treat him specially,

9
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:58,860
and I didn't say you like him.

10
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:09,890
Rest early.

11
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:11,490
I'll go back to my bedroom.

12
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:19,850
Once people

13
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:21,890
like someone,

14
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:23,720
they have a weakness

15
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:26,750
and are not undefeatable anymore.

16
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:07,610
Why do you choose such a bright color?

17
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:08,620
Attendant An

18
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:10,750
said this color was good a few days ago.

19
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:11,620
And haven't you

20
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:13,080
wore this color recently?

21
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:14,190
Take it away.

22
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:16,890
Give me a black one.

23
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:17,950
Take those accessories away

24
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:18,620
as well.

25
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:19,920
Yes.

26
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:22,920
General,

27
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:24,890
the tassel on your sword

28
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:26,090
also has a bright color,

29
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:27,550
so let me remove it for you.

30
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:29,890
I'll keep it.

31
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:31,560
Leave.

32
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:33,620
Yes.

33
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,590
Vice General Xiao,

34
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:50,390
General seems to be in a bad mood.

35
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:51,829
Do I need you to tell me that?

36
00:02:51,829 --> 00:02:53,730
Anyone that has eyes can tell that.

37
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:55,250
What's wrong with General?

38
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:56,060
If I could guess out

39
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:57,260
General's mind,

40
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:58,420
how could I still be a vice general

41
00:02:58,420 --> 00:02:59,829
after so many years?

42
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:03,490
General is angry,

43
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:04,890
and I don't dare to enter.

44
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:05,520
How about

45
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:07,520
you send the clothes in?

46
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:13,920
Oh!

47
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:14,790
Sorry.

48
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:15,720
I got up late.

49
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,950
You come at the right moment.

50
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:21,820
In normal times,

51
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:23,520
you're best at cheering General up.

52
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,120
Take this.

53
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,360
I'll count on you.

54
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:33,150
Go.

55
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:35,440
Go.

56
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:50,620
General,

57
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:52,930
I come to serve you to put on clothes.

58
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:54,120
I don't need you.

59
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:56,650
General.

60
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,850
I said I didn't need you.

61
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:03,880
Also,

62
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,020
stop smiling at me from now on.

63
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,990
Why did you sneeze?

64
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,690
I caught a cold last night.

65
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:23,950
Don't worry, General.

66
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:27,120
Did I say I worried about you?

67
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,690
Since you caught a cold,

68
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:32,320
you don't need to serve me.

69
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:33,560
Xiao Tong.

70
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:34,860
Yes.

71
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:42,790
You'll be responsible

72
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:43,890
for serving me.

73
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:46,490
Then

74
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:48,710
what about An Chen?

75
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:52,690
I don't think there are no other jobs

76
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:53,450
he could do

77
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:54,650
in such a big mansion.

78
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:03,290
Leave.

79
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:04,850
Okay.

80
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:18,890
Is An Chen

81
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:20,790
out of favor with General?

82
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:03,720
He's moody

83
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,050
and likes torturing me.

84
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:10,720
My waist.

85
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:23,390
Two days ago,

86
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:24,690
he held

87
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,630
a bright smile,

88
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:27,960
but now,

89
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,020
he turns against me

90
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:30,660
all of a sudden.

91
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:38,090
Why did An Mei's trick not work?

92
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:53,850
Why do you goof off?

93
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:56,290
Have you finished splitting the firewood?

94
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:58,790
Do you still regard yourself as General's attendant?

95
00:06:58,790 --> 00:06:59,659
Don't delay my time playing mahjong.

96
00:06:59,659 --> 00:07:00,190
No.

97
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,720
Don't annoy me.

98
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:04,750
I...

99
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:10,560
Snob.

100
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:17,990
Right.

101
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:20,390
No matter how useful a trick is,

102
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:22,120
it can't work forever.

103
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:26,190
Even the relationship with customers needs to be maintained.

104
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:32,350
Mr. Ma.

105
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:34,890
Mr. Ma.

106
00:07:35,159 --> 00:07:36,090
Mr. Ma.

107
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:40,159
Why do you stop working?

108
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:41,590
Hurry up to finish your work.

109
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:42,390
Mr. Ma,

110
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:45,159
it's going to be lunch break soon,

111
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:48,159
so you could only play mahjong for one round, right?

112
00:07:48,159 --> 00:07:51,159
If you know that, why don't you split the firewood now?

113
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:56,130
What a pity.

114
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:57,090
Mr. Ma,

115
00:07:57,790 --> 00:07:59,990
there is light shining between your eyes,

116
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:01,720
and your eyes are bright.

117
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,950
You're doomed to be rich.

118
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:07,660
Can you devine through people's looks?

119
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:10,590
People who play mahjong all know that.

120
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:11,350
Mr. Ma,

121
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:12,820
I could tell you're very lucky

122
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:13,960
now.

123
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:14,960
You can

124
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:16,920
win by all concealed hand, self-drawn, all of one suit,

125
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,190
and supplemental tile of melding quad.

126
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:20,250
It's very easy.

127
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,760
Speaking of this,

128
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,090
I find you said it right.

129
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,350
Recently, I've always

130
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:26,790
been lucky.

131
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:29,490
Well,

132
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:32,289
I have an esoterica for mahjong,

133
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,789
which will definitely help you

134
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:35,960
win every round.

135
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,190
Even if you only play one round,

136
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:39,220
you can earn

137
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,030
a lot.

138
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:42,260
Does there exist this kind of esoterica?

139
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:43,720
Let me see.

140
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:49,690
I can give it to you,

141
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:51,330
but

142
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:53,330
I have a demand.

143
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,690
Lend your kitchen

144
00:08:56,690 --> 00:08:57,260
to me.

145
00:08:58,090 --> 00:08:59,790
Why do you borrow it?

146
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:03,790
I want to

147
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:05,950
cook a meal for General

148
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:07,390
to cheer him up.

149
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:09,460
You know that.

150
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:11,590
Fine.

151
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:12,820
Clean it up

152
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:14,520
after you finish cooking.

153
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:16,490
Don't worry.

154
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:17,890
I'll wait for you here.

155
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:21,220
Hope you have supplemental tile of melding quad and be rich.

156
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,550
This thing...

157
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,520
No one will know that

158
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:27,960
except you and me.

159
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:29,220
You're very smart.

160
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:30,060
Very smart.

161
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:32,490
Hope you win a lot of money!
