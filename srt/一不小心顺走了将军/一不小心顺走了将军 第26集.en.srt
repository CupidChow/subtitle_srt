It's the substitute venom of Southern Jiang.

00:00:59,220 --> 00:00:59,760
No!

6
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:01,730
We're tricked.

7
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:19,750
Hey,

8
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:22,330
how do you like the gift

9
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:24,289
I've prepared for you?

10
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,690
Despicable villain!

11
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:29,289
What else have you got except insidious toxic?

12
00:01:58,620 --> 00:01:59,420
General!

13
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:03,560
Lie Yun!

14
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:04,590
General!

15
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:06,080
Don't you touch her!

16
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:10,330
You are as noisy as always.

17
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:11,820
General.

18
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,720
Three days later,

19
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,020
take the written Deployment Map

20
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:17,050
to the suburban inn alone

21
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:18,390
to exchange her.

22
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:20,760
Her or the map,

23
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:21,990
choose for yourself.

24
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:23,390
In three days,

25
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:25,120
if I don't see the map,

26
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,530
I'll let you watch her die.

27
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,490
Lie Yun, don't mind me. Lie Yun.

28

General.

36
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,760
General. Are you awake?

37
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:10,610
What day is it now?

38
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:13,350
You were poisoned.

39
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,250
Though it's been removed already,

40
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:16,460
the doctor asked you

41
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:17,680
to take more rest.

42
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,660
Tell me what day it is now.

43
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:22,280
The third day.

44
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:26,120
General, what are you doing?

45
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,410
I'm going to rescue An Chen.

46
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:28,180
Go away.

47
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:28,980
General.

48
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,510
You can't go, General.

50
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,660
You can't go, General.

You can't go, General.

53
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:40,720
General,

54
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:42,720
your safety is particularly important

55
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,840
to the country and the people.

56
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:46,320
You shouldn't risk

57
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,650
your life for An Chen.

58
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:49,430
I've made up my mind.

59
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:53,829
General,

60
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:56,090
I know I can't stop you.

61
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:57,950
But if you insist on going,

62
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,770
please allow me

63
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:01,880
to take some men with you.

64
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,090
Jiang Qi is ruthless.

65
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:05,910
He specifically asked me to go alone.

66
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:08,210
An Chen is in his hands. I can't risk her life.

67
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:09,670
Can you risk your own life?

68
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:25,020
Fine.

69
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:27,400
You go with me.

70
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:30,350
Yes, General.

71
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,159
Xiao Tong,

72
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:41,980
I'm sorry.

73
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:29,450
You'd better behave

74
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:32,960
and wait for your general to trade you with the map.

75
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,710
If you dare to ruin my plan again,

76
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:37,570
I don't guarantee that

77
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:40,190
he'll get out of here alive.

78
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,050
You despicable villain!

79
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:44,150
You try to get the map by devious means.

80
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:46,409
The war is a business between two countries.

81
00:05:46,409 --> 00:05:48,070
Why would you torture Lie Yun?

82
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:49,240
Torture?

83
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:52,820
He has suffered less than

84
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,810
one ten thousandth of what I've suffered.

85
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:57,450
I want this specially privileged man

86
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,500
to suffer what I have suffered.

87
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,460
What between Lie Yun and me

88
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:06,170
is never a business between our countries.

89
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:07,140
What I want

90
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:09,880
is more than the map.

91
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:15,210
Go.

92
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:15,880

Jiang Qi.

98
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,700
You're really insane.

99

Psychological attack.

100
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:07,390
I must stay calm.

101
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:18,860
Jiang Qi,

102
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,650
I've brought what you want.

103
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:23,350
Come out.

104
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,900
I've been waiting for a long time.

105
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:27,910
So,

106
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,380
how do you like

107
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:33,280
what I've prepared for you?

108
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:35,390
Why did you do this?

109
00:08:35,789 --> 00:08:37,080
Where is An Chen?

110
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:40,630
Who would have thought that

111
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:44,270
Lie Yun, the general who is loyal to his country,

112
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:47,220
would be destroyed because of a woman?

113
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:49,200
Lie Yun,

114
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:51,220
I'm warning you,

if you dare to play tricks again,

116
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:56,110
I'll make this place

117
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:59,020
An Chen's tomb.

118
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:02,650
Jiang Qi, you villain,

119
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:04,470
if anything happens to An Chen,

120
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:06,290
I'll let you die without a burial place.

121
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:07,580
Jiang Qi?

122
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,450
Don't call me Jiang Qi.

123
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:12,110
Listen clearly,

124
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:15,090
I'm Xiang Yao, the Second Prince of Southern Jiang.

125
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,310
Xiang Yao?

126

Are you the Second Prince

127
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:22,210
who was sent by the Southern Emperor

128
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:24,710
to the Venom Moon Sect as a hostage?

129
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,590
Over the eight years in the sect,

130
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:34,490
my life was miserable.

131
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:36,220
It's dangerous

132
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:37,480
to lurk in Rui Kingdom,

133
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:40,670
but it's my only chance to turn around.

134
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:43,010
As soon as I get the map,

135
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:45,150
I'll defeat your country.

136

My father will regard me with special attention.

137

I'll become the supreme man

138

of Southern Jiang.

139
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:55,490
I'm determined to get the map.
