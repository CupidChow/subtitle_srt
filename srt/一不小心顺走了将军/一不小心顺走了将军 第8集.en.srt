[Episode 8]

4
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:42,720
The third step

5
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:45,380
to winning a man's heart

6
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:46,310
is to

7
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,540
prepare his favorite food.

8
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:59,440
You get changed and prepare food for General in my place,

9
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:00,770
and now you're cooking

10
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:02,030
for him in my place.

11
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:07,120
General,

12
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,820
do you still remember your Tong?

13
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:27,640
General,

14
00:01:35,229 --> 00:01:35,680
these

15
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:35,920
are

16
00:01:36,039 --> 00:01:38,140
Bugle Call Meatball,

17
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:41,130
Banner Waving Duck,

18
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:43,630
Beacon Fire Fish,

19
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:44,970
Breeze Moon

20
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:46,460
Chicken.

21
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:47,150
And

22
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:48,039
this,

23
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:48,770
this one,

24
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,140
this one, and this one.

25
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:51,710
These are the dishes

26
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:53,150
I specially made for you.

27
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:55,630
You gave them names?

28
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,970
I'm not talented.

29
00:01:57,970 --> 00:01:59,370
Please do not laugh at it.

30
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,770
From the names given,

31
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:03,060
I don't think

32
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,660
you're someone uneducated.

33
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,610
What's this one?

34
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:20,920
Lucky Noodles.

35
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,050
It's my

36
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:23,700
speciality.

37
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:34,710
I think it's more like watery and tasteless noodles.

38
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,320
You may

39
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:48,140
have a taste.

40
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,650
Yun,

41
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:17,470
your mother died early,

42
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:18,520
and I've

43
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,320
gone on an expedition for years,

44
00:03:20,579 --> 00:03:22,520
leaving us no chance to celebrate your birthday.

45
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,850
As year-end approaches,

46
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:25,020
let's eat the bowl of

47
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:27,570
lucky noodles that your mother loved the most.

48
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:28,620
May you be

49
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:29,829
the backbone of the country

50
00:03:29,829 --> 00:03:31,040
when you grow up.

51
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:32,450
Come on.

52
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,250
Open your mouth.

53
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:42,710
It tastes good.

54
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:43,480
Of course.

55
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:45,780
I'm the Master Chef,

56
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:47,680
and I do deserve the name all these years of traveling around.

57
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,540
Back when I was a little girl, Meiâ€¦

58
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,650
my sister got punished,

59
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:53,980
and no matter how sad she was,

60
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:55,760
having a taste of the noodles I made

61
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,020
always cheered her up.

62
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,410
It's okay.

63
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:07,780
Tell me more about your stories.

64
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:13,740
I'll get you loaded today.

65
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:19,430
About me,

66
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:20,930
well, I'm not gifted

67
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:22,500
or ambitious.

68
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:24,200
When I was young,

69
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,570
I didn't have enough food to eat,

70
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:27,500
so I just wanted to fill my stomach.

71
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,650
Now I've grown up

72
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:31,230
and turned out to be a drifter.

73
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:32,320
So I'm longing for

74
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,650
a home,

75
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:35,140
and a few mu of farmland,

76
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:37,480
so that I can settle down and live in peace.

77
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:40,960
I can work on the farmland during the day and sleep at night.

78
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:41,770
When there's free time,

79
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:43,390
I'll travel around

80
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:45,280
and eat delicious food all over the world.

81
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:45,810
Well,

82
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:47,510
good health is necessary.

83
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:49,080
People who are careless and unconcerned

84
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,210
tend to live longer.

85
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:50,780
Yes.

86
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:52,800
Enjoy every moment and make it count.

87
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,810
Leave the future worries

88
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:54,980
to tomorrow.

89
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:56,990
Come on, General,

90
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:00,350
I'd like to propose a toast to you.

91
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:03,790
I never drink.

92
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:07,020
Well...

93
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:08,430
I'll drink it up.

94
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:09,290
Help yourself.

95
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:17,600
Speaking of good health,

96
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I do need to thank you for something.

97
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,370
We talked about starting with children

98
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:24,830
when it comes to building up a good physique,

99
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:26,450
which inspired me.

100
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:28,990
When I told His Majesty about this and gave him some suggestion,

101
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:30,360
he was greatly pleased

102
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:31,210
and took my advice.

103
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:32,220
I told you

104
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:33,920
this would definitely work.

105
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:36,950
His Majesty takes this thing very seriously

106
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:37,800
and has issued an imperial decree

107
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,890
to promote it nationwide

108
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:39,490
and name it

109
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:41,350
physical education class.

110
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:46,680
Good name!

111
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:48,820
How come I never think of

112
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:50,550
reporting this to His Majesty?

113
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,580
You're so wise.

114
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:53,440
Come.

115
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:54,120
General,

116
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,530
This is for the physical education class,

117
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:00,620
for you,

118
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:02,280
and the future of Rui Kingdom.

119
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,010
Cheers!

120
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:09,260
Great!

121
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:11,330
This deserves a toast.

122
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,159
Mr. Jiang,

123
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:49,420
you can

124
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:50,750
have a rest tonight.

125
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:51,600
Tomorrow,

126
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:52,850
you'll

127
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:54,830
continue to play the zither to heal him.

128
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:56,280
The poison inside General's body

129
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,580
has been suppressed.

130
00:06:58,180 --> 00:06:59,180
It's not a big deal

131
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:00,320
if I skip a night.

132
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:01,820
Alas.

133
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:04,240
Oh.

134
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:07,310
Vice General Xiao,

135
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:08,360
what's wrong?

136
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,840
I'm afraid I, the right-hand man of General

137
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:12,120
will give way to An Chen

138
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,650
in a few days.

139
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:15,990
What do you mean?

140
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,770
I used to be at the service of General

141
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:19,190
during the day,

142
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:20,070
and you played chess

143
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:22,010
and talked with him at night.

144
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:22,980
But now

145
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:24,520
it's An Chen who

146
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,810
sticks with General.

147
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,890
An Chen's his attendant.

148
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:31,220
It makes sense

149
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:32,800
that he's there for General.

150
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,530
Yes.

151
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:34,700
But he

152
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:37,360
actually drank with General.

153
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:39,100
Even you never get the privilege

154
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:40,110
to have drinks with General,

155
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:42,050
not to mention me.

156
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:43,940
So there's such a thing.

157
00:07:58,330 --> 00:07:59,300
General, general,

158
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:00,390
I'll show you

159
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:02,450
the moves I practiced when I was young.

160
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:02,980
Alright.

161
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:07,940
Check it out.

162
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:10,450
Embrace the sun.

163
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:13,230
Hahahha.

164
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:16,140

00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,690

Leading away the Sheep by the Way.
