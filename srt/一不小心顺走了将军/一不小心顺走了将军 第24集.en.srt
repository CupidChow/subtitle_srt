[Episode 24]

4
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:48,940
General,

5
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:50,880
as you ordered,

6
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,020
I looked into Jiang Qi's identity.

7
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:55,120
All people who had contact with him were killed,

8
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,140
without exception.

9
00:00:57,990 --> 00:00:58,720
Currently,

10
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,450
we have no clue

11
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:01,790
about his identity.

12
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:06,110
That's the real him, Jiang Qi.

13
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,450
He's so ruthless.

14
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:11,039
Go find out

15
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,060
what's the relationship

16
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,520
between Jiang Qi and Anhun Pavilion.

17
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,320
Yes, General.

18
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:51,920
An Chen,

19
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:54,870
I wish we had met earlier.

20
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:57,250
I almost thought

21
00:01:57,860 --> 00:01:59,590
my life would be just like that.

22
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:02,830
These cherry blossoms

23
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,250
are the gifts for you.

24
00:02:09,009 --> 00:02:09,810
An Chen,

25
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:12,160
I like you.

26
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:15,370
Are you willing to be with me?

27
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:28,800
I want to tell you

28
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:31,220
I like you.

29
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:33,850
I like you very very much.

30
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,450
If it's a boy,

31
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:52,270
let's call him Qihong,

32
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,530
meaning lofty ambition

33
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:56,380
and a safe and auspicious life.

34
00:02:56,829 --> 00:02:57,640
Well,

35
00:02:58,210 --> 00:02:59,990
if it's a girl,

36
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:01,600
let's call her Zhitao,

37
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,020
meaning peach blossom and luck,

38
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:04,220
and a brilliant life.

39
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,450
I also wish her

40
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:08,190
a safe, happy and lucky life.

41
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:00,260
Lie Yun.

42
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:22,470
Let's go.

43
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:26,350
You look

44
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:27,850
so beautiful.

45
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:34,590
What's wrong?

46
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:41,620
If you like,

47
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,970
I'll dress up for you every day.

48
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:50,870
Let's go.

49
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:07,400
Is there anything bothering you?

50
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:09,620
No.

51
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:11,920
I was just thinking about

52
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,620
what to cook for you today.

53
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:17,080
If I can have what you cooked every day,

54
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:18,750
I would be really happy.

55
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:22,420
Handsome brother,

56
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:23,760
would you like to buy some flowers

57
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,650
for this beautiful sister?

58
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:28,560
How much?

59
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:32,520
Two cents.

60
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,580
It's really cheap.

61
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:36,120
No, it's silver.

62
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,170
Keep the change.

63
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:43,350
Thank you, brother.

64
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:44,800
Thank you.

65
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:53,450
He is a little liar.

66
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:54,860
Why are you so kind to him?

67
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:57,770
No one is born a liar.

68
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:00,310
The kid

69
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:01,370
is dressed in rags,

70
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:03,590
but there's an old book on his waist.

71
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:04,600
In the future,

72
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,050
he might become an eminent person.

73
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,420
He couldn't choose his birth.

74
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:12,430
But

75
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:16,200
I want him to have an opportunity to choose his future.

76
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:40,020
An Chen,

77
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:42,159
this time,

78
00:06:42,159 --> 00:06:44,430
one of the three of us must die.

79
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:47,150
After accomplishing this mission,

80
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:50,120
you will be truly free.

81
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:11,730
Are you okay?

82
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:20,460
The soup will be ready soon.

83
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:22,390
You may go inside and wait a minute.

84
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:29,870
OK.

85
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,730
Be careful.

86
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:41,510
An Chen,

87
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:47,400
no matter what you decide to do,

88
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:49,100
you must remember this.

89
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,770
You still have me.

90
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,360
Anhun Pavilion's forces

91
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:12,070
are interconnected and complicated in the four states.

92
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:14,300
The four states contained each other.

93
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:16,570
If Jiang Qi cooperates with them,

94
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:19,960
it won't be easy for us.

95
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:21,220
General,

96
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:23,280
what should we do next?

97
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:27,140
Go on with mediation.

98
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:28,850
Yes, General.

99
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:51,760
An Chen,

100
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:55,820
you must not do anything stupid.

101
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:08,400
General.

102
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,210
Ziming,

103
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:14,240
the forces on the border are complicated.

104
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:17,070
I need the latest intelligence and information.

105
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:18,620
I want to readjust the deployment

106
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:20,480
against Southern Jiang.

107
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:23,510
But the only person who has the ability

108
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:24,960
and I trust the most

109
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:26,010
is you.

110
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,030
I know your parents are still alive

111
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,480
and you're still single.

112
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:32,600
The mission is extremely dangerous.

113
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:35,990
I'm wondering if you're willing to do it.

114
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:38,410
Ever since I began to serve under your command,

115
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:39,300
I've been seeing you

116
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:40,360
as my talent scout.

117
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,600
You've been helping me

118
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,660
and protecting me.

119
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:45,600
When I was taunted and ridiculed by others,

120
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:46,780
you valued me.

121
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:49,480
Attendant An is my mentor.

122
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,140
When I felt at lost,

123
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:52,660
she showed me the way.

124
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,570
Now I have the opportunity to serve the country

125
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:56,430
and live up to your expectations.

126
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:58,570
I'd love to do that.

127
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:00,150
OK.

128
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:02,210
Wang Ziming, here is the order.

129
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:02,970
Yes.

130
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:04,510
Now,

131
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:07,090
I want you to sneak into the border of Southern Jiang,

132
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:09,880
and send me back the latest intelligence and information.

133
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,380
I hope you can live up to my expectations

134
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:13,070
and successfully fulfill the mission.

135
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:14,120
Yes, General.

136
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:16,550
I'll leave for the south

137
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:18,000
and I won't fail you.

138
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:20,980
If something happened to me,

139
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:21,920
please

140
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,010
help me take care of my parents.

141
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:29,710
I assure you that.

142
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:30,810
And I believe in you.
