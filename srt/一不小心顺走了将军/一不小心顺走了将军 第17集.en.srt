Did you think I would kill you?

00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:48,260
Death is the slightest punishment for you.

00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:51,600
You almost ruined my plan.

00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:55,320
I'd like you to see with your eyes

Jiang Qi,

You shouldn't hurt him in this way.

00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,380
When he dies,

23
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:39,550
I'll spread the word that

who have lurked in the Mansion

26
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:45,610

27
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:46,440
it is also you

you can accompany him in hell.

32
