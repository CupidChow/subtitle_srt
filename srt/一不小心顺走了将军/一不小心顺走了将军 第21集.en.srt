[Episode 21]

4
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:39,080
When I just came here,

5
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,460
you always made fun of me

6
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:42,560
and forced me to work early in the morning.

7
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,290
I was so angry and afraid of you.

8
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,380
But gradually,

9
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:49,460
the more you did that to me

10
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:51,790
the more I wanted to get near you.

11
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:53,720
In fact,

12
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:57,050
I've had a crush on you for a long time.

13
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:00,320
But I was worried

14
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:02,420
that you may dislike me

15
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:04,050
after knowing my identity.

16
00:01:04,819 --> 00:01:07,720
I kept telling myself not to like you

17
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:09,220
until

18
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:12,250
you gave me your most precious sachet.

19
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:14,720
You told me

20
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:16,550
that I'm not a speck of mote.

21
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:20,020
Then I told myself

22
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:22,680
that I could no longer hide myself.

23
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:26,789
Lie Yun,

24
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:29,490
meeting you

25
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,220
costs all my lucks.

26
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:35,420
I want to tell you

27
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:37,850
I like you.

28
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:41,380
I like you very much.

29
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:43,920
I like you very very much.

You two

50
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:53,720
are becoming harder to be trained.

51
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,420
I told you to run laps at the training site.

52
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:56,650
But look at yourselves.

53
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:57,260
General,

54
00:02:57,690 --> 00:02:58,420
I assure you

55
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,190
that I will well train them.

56
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:01,190
Come on.

57
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:02,650
Go.

58
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,390
Yun,

59
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:11,920
you're so handsome.

60
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:17,850
An Chen,

61
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:20,020
An Chen.

62
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:24,550
I'm coming.

63
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:28,790
Vice General Xiao,

64
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:30,250
Did General send you here?

65
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:31,420
No.

66
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:32,820
It's me.

67
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,180
I'm coming for personal affairs.

68
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:42,260
I know I'm beautiful and striking.

69
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:43,420
But,

70
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:45,680
I've fallen in love with General.

71
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,790
So, I'm sorry.

72
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:49,750
No kidding.

73
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:52,550
General would punish me.

74
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:53,920
I'm kidding.

75
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:54,750
Don't be angry.

76
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:55,260
Let's go.

77
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:55,720
Come on,

78
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:56,520
what is it?

79
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:07,050
Come on,

80
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:07,720
what is it?

81
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:14,120
Is this your senior sister's?

82
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:17,720
It's An Mei's favorite bracelet.

83
00:04:18,649 --> 00:04:19,820
You're going to die.

84
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:21,620
You broke her bracelet.

85
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:23,120
She will kill you.

86
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:26,850
An Chen,

87
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:28,250
can you tell me

88
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:29,520
what An Mei likes

89
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,780
and what she dislikes?

90
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:32,159
Do you

91
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,590
also have a crush on An Mei?

92
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:37,590
Crush?

93
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:39,909
I don't think so.

94
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,380
Are there many men liking her?

95
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:49,560
If they stand in line from east to west of the town

96
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,380
in snake shape,

97
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:54,890
there would be eight lines.

98
00:04:57,950 --> 00:04:58,990
You are

99
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:04,620
too ugly

100
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:06,890
and too stupid.

101
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:09,640
You have no chance.

102
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:11,250
Well,

103
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,020
you may not tell me about her.

104
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,420
But how can you insult me?

105
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:17,960
I didn't say no.

106
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:19,320
Tell you what?

107
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:21,190
My senior sister

108
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:22,450
likes jewelry,

109
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:25,020
gold,

110
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:26,110
silver,

111
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:27,050
jade

112
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:28,220
and diamond.

113
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:30,020
The more valuable

114
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:32,320
the better.

115
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:03,190
General.

116
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:05,980
What's the matter?

117
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:07,990
You've been wandering all morning.

118
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:09,890
I'm counting my savings.

119
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:10,920
Why?

120
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:12,750
Do you need money?

121
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:14,020
No.

122
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:15,290
I

123
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:17,580
just want to buy a bracelet.

124
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,350
What do you need a bracelet?

125
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:22,750
An Chen told me

126
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:25,020
that all girls like beautiful jewelry.

127
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:28,620
What else did she say?

128
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:31,320
She also mentioned gold,

129
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:32,090
silver,

130
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,720
valuable stones,

131
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,020
and diamond, a kind of stone that can blind the eyes.

132
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:40,480
Whatever, the more valuable the better.

133
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:42,120
Oh.

134
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,250
OK.

135
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:44,780
Let's go.

136
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:46,820
I need you to do something for me.

137
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,190
Be careful.

138
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:54,350
Watch your steps.

139
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,550
Don't drop them.

140
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:01,820
Slowly. Slowly.

141
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,360
Attendant An.

142
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:18,120
Attendant An.

143
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,120
I'm coming.

144
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:25,550
What's inside this?

145
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:26,510
It's so heavy.

146
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:27,140
Shoo.

147
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,020
This

148
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:36,520
is…

149
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:37,830
Attendant An,

150
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,390
General said

151
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:42,190
you'll manage mansion expenses from now on.

152
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,050
Come on. Open these chests.

153
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:04,220
All these will be taken charge by me?

154
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:09,380
Am I a rich woman now?

155
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,920
I should go thank God.

156
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:15,880
Move those inside.

157
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:17,990
Be careful.

158
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:27,610
Wipe your mouth drooling with greed.

159
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:34,620
These are all worldly possessions,

160
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:37,120
certainly less important than my General.

161
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:39,789
But

162
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:41,419
General,

163
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:44,150
why do you give me these valuable things?

164
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:47,050
Well,

165
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,120
it's

166
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:55,910
because of this.

167
00:08:58,410 --> 00:08:59,220
Cramp?

168
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:00,510
No.

169
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,050
this.

170
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:07,750
Counting money?

171
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,090
No.

172
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:11,380
It's falling for you.

173
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:12,710
Little miser.

174
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:36,140
Sweet and Sour Fish.

175
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:44,900
Shoo.

176
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:24,260
General,

177
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:26,380
what are you looking for?

178
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:37,480
Come on.

179
