4
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:40,410
General, don't make jokes about me.

5
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:43,480
A woman can never be so rough like me.

6
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:46,300
All I want is to serve you well.

7
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:48,070
I won't have any improper thoughts.

8
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:48,910
General,

9
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:51,270
is there anything else I can do for you?

10
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,110
Go wash the clothes that

11
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:57,370
General just took off.

12
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,170
Yes.

13
00:00:58,630 --> 00:00:59,270
Yes.

14
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:19,700
Keep an eye on him.

15
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:21,940
Keep him busy in case he runs around.

16
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:22,539
Yes.

17
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:23,830
By the way,

18
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:25,840
get some women here.

19
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:27,130
Yes.

20
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:35,240
It's so heavy.

21
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,080
Why's a man

22
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,940
having so many clothes to change?

23
00:01:50,509 --> 00:01:51,610
How come the women

24
00:01:51,979 --> 00:01:53,770
are in men's clothing?

25
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:03,480
How come.

So tired

37
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:21,770
and hungry.

38
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:24,510
Life is so hard.

39
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:27,280
I'm pretty sure General

40
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,210
is making things difficult for me.

41
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:30,800

get ready to serve General lunch.

43
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:39,690
Oh my goodness!

44
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:41,300
Mei!

45
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:43,280
Someone, help me!

46
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,570
Mei,

47
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:54,350
you're finally here!

48
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,380
You can still recognize me.

49
00:03:58,070 --> 00:03:59,890
I can even if you become ashes.

50
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:10,550
Mei, how can you

51
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:12,610
just leave me here

52
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:14,210
regardless of my situation?

53
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:16,200
My sweet Chen,

54
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:18,670
the pressure gives you an impetus.

55
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:20,320
You can take the opportunity

56
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,660
to steal the Deployment Map.

57
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:22,830
Once you get it,

58
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:24,490
we'll share the credit.

59
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:27,190
You're good at calculating.

60
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:30,670
I guess my hands will

61
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:33,290
get wasted from washing too many clothes

62
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:35,220
before I steal the Deployment Map.

63
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:37,730
Well,

64
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:40,600
I've touched countless treasures.

65
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,659
See what I'm doing now.

66
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,080
Wash a man's stinky clothes,

67
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:44,680
socks,

68
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,530
and shoes.

69
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,260
Poor hands.

70
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:51,270
Show me.

71
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:52,280
God.

72
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:53,770
It's okay.

73
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:55,020
Hang in there,

74
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:56,280
and you'll soon

75
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,210
get out of here.

76
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:01,370
Easy for you to say.

77
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:03,510
The General is paranoid.

78
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:05,600
It's not easy for you to get it done.

79
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:08,430
Shh.

80
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,140
I found a big secret

81
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:16,630
of General.

82
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:17,240
What?

83
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:20,190
You found his treasury!

84
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,980
What else is on your mind

85
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:24,350
except for money?

86
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,690
I'm better than you.

87
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:29,000
Your head just makes you look tall.

88
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:32,710
Gotta go.

89
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:36,270
Secret.

90
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:37,360
Tell me the secret.

91
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:43,980
I'll tell you.

92
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:45,440
I know why General

93
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,540
stays away from womanizing.

94
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:48,670
Why?

95
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:49,440
He

96
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,100
is allergic to women.

97
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:01,270
You.

98
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:02,280
Touch it.

99
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:09,070
He gets rash on

100
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:10,040
any part that is touched by a woman,

101
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,170
just like being poisoned.

102
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:11,730
So,

103
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:12,620
you should avoid

104
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:13,470
getting close to him,

105
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:15,530
in case he finds out you're a woman.

106
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:17,070
No way.

107
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:19,730
I hugged him when he was undressed.

108
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:21,590
There was nothing wrong with him.

109
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,690
Undressed?

110
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:26,150
So juicy?

111
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:35,200
It's because he's allergic to women

112
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,740
that I saw him

113
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:39,120
sending women in men's clothing

114
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,450
to his room.

115
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:43,400
No wonder.

116
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:45,460
Why isn't General allergic to you?

117
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:47,200
He must have taken you as a man.

118
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:47,930
Look at you.

119
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:49,140
From top to bottom,

120
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:50,110
inside and out,

121
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:51,000
which part of you

122
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,060
makes you look like

123
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:53,180
a woman?

124
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,460
So the mission

About the bonus,

I get 80% of it and you get the rest.

One more word and you'll only get 10%.

I can be any type he wants.

I'm allergic to women,

it's time to take the medicine.

154
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:20,510

I'm here to serve you lunch.

156
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,159
Have the clothes

157

been washed clean?

158
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:37,320
All done.

159
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,730
As good as new.

160
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:44,340
I'll bring the soup for you.

161
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,330
Um.

162
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:48,990
It's hot these days.

163
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:50,870
I should get changed more often.

00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:05,900
Why does it take so long for the soup to bring over?

170
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,490
I'll go take a look.

171
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,280
Such a harum-scarum.

172
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,680
Go get changed.

Yes.

Don't worry.

177
