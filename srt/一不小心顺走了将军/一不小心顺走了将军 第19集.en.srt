[Episode 19]

4
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,520
I've known Jiang Qi for eight years.

5
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:43,950
We played chess in Mansion,

6
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:47,290
and trained soldiers together.

7
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:49,750
I was wounded many times on the battlefield.

8
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:52,790
It's him who treated me.

9
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:58,150
I didn't believe in the saying of hitting it off.

10
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:00,520
But after chatting with you,

11
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:02,350
I feel like

12
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:05,420
you are the one who knows me best in the world.

13
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:07,320
Long distance

14
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:08,920
separates no bosom friends.

15
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,750
I'm a free and unrestrained doctor,

16
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:13,390
longing for seeing great mountains and rivers.

17
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:14,720
General Lie,

18
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,260
you shoulder great responsibilities.

19
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:17,920
I couldn't stay here forever.

20
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:22,590
When you're back,

21
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:25,680
I'll surely treat you with good wine.

22
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:30,720
Mr. Jiang,

23
00:01:30,789 --> 00:01:31,520
you go first.

24
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:53,860
Qi.

25
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:55,350
Qi.

26
00:01:57,650 --> 00:01:58,590
Are you okay?

27
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,180
It's poisoned.

28
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:06,590
General.

29
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:07,320
Doctor,

30
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:08,150
how is he?

31
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,030
His life is saved,

32
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:12,260
but I could do nothing

33
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:15,260
about his legs.

34
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:17,650
What do you mean?

35
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,790
You must save his legs. It's an order.

36
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:22,190
General,

37
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:34,660
I know my own condition.

38
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,630
About my legs,

39
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:39,250
there is nothing I could do.

40
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:42,180
Don't force him to do what he can't.

41
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:45,190
Qi,

42
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:47,760
I'm sorry.

43
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:49,590
it's all my fault.

44
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:52,550
It's not your fault.

45
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:55,220
Using my legs

46
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,090
to exchange your safety

47
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,829
is worth it.

48
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,920
I couldn't believe

49
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:12,820
that he is the spy from Southern Jiang.

50
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:16,750
The one I took as a brother

51
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:22,650
turns out to be the traitor who hurts me the hardest.

52
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,360
He fooled us all.

53
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:32,110
I've forgiven you.

54
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:32,790
Are you

55
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:35,450
really not mad at me?

56
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:41,760
How could I still be mad at you?

57
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:45,820
You risked your life to save me.

58
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:48,420
That proves everything.

59
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:52,750
And

60
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:58,550
more importantly, I've known my heart.

61
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,820
Even in the state of illusion,

62
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:07,620
I wanted to trust you.

63
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:09,950
An Chen,

64
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:18,720
you were on your own before

65
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,460
and suffered a lot.

66
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:26,320
From now on,

67
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:29,060
I won't allow anyone

68
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:34,550
to make you do anything against your will.

69
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:47,750
You've always wanted this.

70
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:50,960
It's yours now.

71
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:05,460
It's the last thing I have from my mother.

72
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:08,190
It's also what I cherish the most.

73
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,120
I've known for long

74
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:16,590
that you're a woman.

75
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:19,460
Kidding and making fun of you

76
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,560
and watching you angry

77
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,590
make me so joyful.

78
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:26,960
I've been wondering

79
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:30,190
why you're the only woman I like

80
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:33,390
and want to get close to.

81
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:38,830
I feel relaxed

82
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,750
only when I'm with you.

83
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:44,030
Seeing you smile,

84
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:47,420
I would smile too.

85
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,460
An Chen,

86
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:08,760
could you

87
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:09,950
stay?

88
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,590
Um.

89
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:24,550
What did you say?

90
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,120
I didn't hear it.

91
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:32,830
Actually, it doesn't matter where to live.

92
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:34,960
I'm well-fed and well-treated here.

93
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:37,390
It's okay to stay here.

94
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:42,560
Then I must try to

95
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:44,960
make you feel comfortable here

96
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:48,460
and reluctant to leave.

97
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:04,860
General,

98
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:07,320
you're not recovered yet.

99
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:26,450
General,

100
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:29,160
you must take care of your health.

101
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:36,360
Xiao Tong,

102
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:38,790
go to the training site and run 20 laps.

103
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:41,720
Violating the order will get a military punishment.

104
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:44,659
General,

105
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,050
it's important to rest.

106
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:47,150
You may have some rest.

107
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:48,810
I'll come to see you tomorrow.

108
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:58,020
Look at me.

109
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:01,050
Can't you stay to take care of me?

110
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,250
Just have some rest.

111
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,580
I'll see you tomorrow.

112
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:11,550
When you're recovered, weâ€¦

113
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:19,080
Xiao Tong.

114
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,220
I just knew that you're unwilling

115
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:36,090
to leave me.

116
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:48,200
[Do Not Disturb]

117
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:49,250
Vice General Xiao,

118
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:50,220
what's going on?

119
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,630
Do not disturb.

120
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:03,730
What's the smell?

121
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:06,990
It stinks.

122
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:11,190
What are you doing there?

123
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:17,360
An Chen,

124
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:22,420
An Chen,

125
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:23,990
An Chen,

126
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:31,690
An Chen,

127
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,160
are you okay?

128
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:34,680
I'm okay. I'm okay.

129
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:40,350
What are you doing here?

130
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,320
I'm here to see you.

131
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:45,920
Ah, roses.

132
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:48,630
Yeah.

133
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,650
Roses help relieve depression

134
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,720
and nourish qi and blood.

135
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:54,660
I could try it.

136
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:00,190
I'm going back to my room.

137
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:05,970
[Do Not Disturb]

138
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:10,190
Does she like me or not?

139
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,590
She just run away.

140
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:13,420
It's obvious no.

141
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,030
Then, you tell me what liking is.
