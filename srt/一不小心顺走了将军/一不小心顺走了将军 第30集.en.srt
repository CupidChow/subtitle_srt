[Episode 30]

4
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:38,570
I've restrained myself for years

5
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:41,670
deploying carefully and penetrating in all respects.

6
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:43,770
Now,

7
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:47,610
it finally starts.

8
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:49,040
Father,

9
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:50,270
the Lie Family,

10
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:51,000
Eastern Rui,

11
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:52,050
Southern Jiang,

12
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:53,940
all those who look down upon me

13
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:55,670
and have humiliated me,

14
00:00:56,170 --> 00:00:58,580
wait and see.

15
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:02,780
I will uproot you one by one

16
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:04,760
and unify the southeast area.

17
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:12,730
Lie Yun.

18
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,400
Lie Yun.

19
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:26,470
Lie Yun, don't go.

20
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:34,100
I'm sorry.

21
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:36,509
Miss An,

22
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:37,940
if you go on like this,

23
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:39,890
General wouldn't rest in peace.

24
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:41,090
Now,

25
00:01:41,259 --> 00:01:43,140
the Death Token of Anhun Pavilion has been removed.

26
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:45,670
You should go after the idyllic life

27
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:47,170
you've always dreamed of.

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,580
There's a great world outside.

29
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:50,810
You don't have to be tied

30
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:52,270
in a small place like

31
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:53,680
the capital of Rui.

32
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:08,539
Here,

33
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,730
we used to have drinking competition,

34
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:13,400
enjoy flowers

35
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:15,970
and have meals together.

36
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:21,770
He risked his life for me.

37
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,800
I promised to spend my life with him.

38
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:29,740
He said,

39
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:32,940
he wouldn't leave me alone.

40
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:36,270
These days, I've always felt someone was following me

41
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:37,470
and looking after me.

42
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:41,370
It must be him, right?

43
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:43,710
He must be protecting me

44
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:44,940
and keeping me safe.

45
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:48,810
An Chen,

46
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:51,270
don't lie to yourself.

47
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,740
We searched for five days and nights,

48
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:56,000
but we didn't find him.

49
00:02:57,070 --> 00:02:58,770
General ordered me

50
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:00,140
to protect you.

51
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:03,910
The man you saw

52
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:06,500
was me.

53
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,870
I don't believe it.

54
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:10,930
I don't believe it

55
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,170
General bought this

56
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:23,670
when he was alive.

57
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:26,510
The house is small,

58
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:28,870
but it's comfortable and neat.

59
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:03,670
Lie Yun,

60
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:06,470
you said

61
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,970
you would give me whatever I wanted.

62
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:15,970
But I only want you.

63
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:20,380
You're the only thing I want.

64
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:05,940
General,

65
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:08,180
I passed on your words

66
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:09,510
to An Chen.

67
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
She

68
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:13,310
has left.

69
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:15,410
That's good.

70
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:16,540
General,

71
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:19,270
since An Chen learned about your death,

72
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:20,810
she's been extremely grieved.

73
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:22,170
You have

74
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:23,870
gone through a lot.

75
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:25,770
Why do you do this?

76
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:38,060
Has anything happened in Southern Jiang recently?

77
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:44,470
The Southern Emperor fell ill suddenly.

78
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:46,570
There's a fierce struggle in the imperial court.

79
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:47,670
Xiang Yao volunteered to

80
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:48,770
go out to battle at the border

81
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:50,830
in order to seize the military power.

82
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:54,070
He has gathered many people with wondrous powers.

83
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:54,670
Soon,

84
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:56,930
200,000 troops from Southern Jiang

85
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:58,510
will arrive at the border.

86
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:03,800
200,000?

87
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:05,900
Xiao Tong,

88
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:08,280
what do you think

89
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:10,940
our odds of victory are?

90
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:14,100
General,

91
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:14,970
the Lie's Army

92
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:16,260
and I all

93
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,710
believe in you.

94
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:18,840
We will follow you

95
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,170
and die without regret.

96
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:29,710
We are soldiers.

97
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:31,700
It's our duty

98
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:33,260
to fight for the safety of our country

99
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:34,120
and our people.

100
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:36,570
But An Chen is different.

101
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,820
She shouldn't be under

102
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:44,020
such great pressure.

103
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:47,310
I have

104
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:51,110
put her in danger many times.

105
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:53,900
She almost lost her life.

106
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:56,970
This time, I can't

107
00:06:57,970 --> 00:06:59,610
let her risk in any case.

108
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:02,970
As far as you know,

109
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:05,770
if she knew I was alive,

110
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,100
what would she do?

111
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,300
I'm afraid

112
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,300
she'll go to the battle

113
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:13,610
together with you.

114
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:19,010
She lived a

115
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:21,270
hard life before.

116
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:23,940
From now on,

117
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:27,030
I hope she'll be safe and sound.

118
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:33,010
If I return in triumph,

119
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:34,540
I will

120
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:35,560
never let her

121
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:36,120
go again.

122
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,540
If I can't,

123
00:07:43,409 --> 00:07:45,340
I don't want her to be sad again.

124
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:51,370
So, don't let her know

125
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,770
I'm still alive.

126
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:00,410
Yes, sir.
