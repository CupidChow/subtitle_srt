4
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:37,420
Lie Yun.

5
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:38,520
Lie Yun, wake up.

6
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:40,020
Lie Yun, come on.

7
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:30,820
Lie Yun.

8
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,080
Lie Yun, wake up.

9
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,120
Lie Yun.

10
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:35,220
What did you do to Lie Yun?

11
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:39,720
He's in a state of illusion as his soul is under my control.

12
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:42,320
He will never come to his sense.

13
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:45,620
You've ruined my plan.

14
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:47,950
Go to hell.

15
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,820
You wake up from the illusion.

16
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:34,120
Don't try to be heroinic with an injury.

17
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:34,990
Step back.

18
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,350
So, it's really you.

19
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:40,020
You were so close

20
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,920
to become my puppet.

21
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:17,690
Vice General Xiao,

22
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:19,750
the right lower rib is the weak point.

23
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:24,410
I can't believe

24
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:26,190
that you're using our trick

25
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:27,820
on me.

26
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:29,650
Stop being hypocritical.

27
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,390
Did you ever really trust me?

28
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:32,620
Cut the crap.

29
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:34,220
We serve different masters,

30
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:35,820
so we're bound to be enemies.

31
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:52,820
Mr. Jiang?

32
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:58,020
Howâ€¦

33
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:00,690
How are you able to stand up?

34
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,720
Are you an idiot?

35
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:04,650
Don't you see what's going on?

36
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:06,460
Jiang Qi,

37
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:08,910
you're just a cunning villain.

38
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:11,420
You played a dirty trick on me last time.

39
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,450
This time,

40
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:14,990
my sword will reclaim the debts from you.

41
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:19,250
What's wrong with you?

42
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:21,620
He is the spy from Southern Jiang.

43
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:23,520
Mr. Jiang?

44
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:24,620
Are you blind

45
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:25,580
and stupid too?

46
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:27,880
What are you waiting for?

47
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:28,820
Take him.

48
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:30,620
Vice General Xiao,

49
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:31,680
who should we take?

50
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:33,120
Both of them.

51
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:43,650
Your general is suffering from my Alluring Venom.

52
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:45,260
Having him die with me

53
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:47,220
is not bad.

54
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:48,890
What did you do to our general?

55
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:51,350
We'll spare your life if you give us the cure.

56
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,460
OK.

57
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,120
No.

58
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:03,420
It's a trick.

59
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:10,050
Search the entire Mansion.

60
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:10,790
Find him.

61
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:12,520
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

62
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:13,920
General.

63
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:14,960
Lie Yun.

64
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:16,350
General.

65
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:19,250
Lie Yun.

66
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:20,750
Stay calm.

67
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:21,590
Vice General Xiao,

68
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:23,980
I didn't mean to hurt General.

69
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:26,190
Lie Yun.

70
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:28,910
He is just in a coma.

71
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:30,050
Don't worry.

72
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:50,659
How is he?

73
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:52,060
You may rest assured.

74
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:53,320
General is fine.

75
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,250
Thanks to you this time.

76
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:58,790
You brought General back to conscious

77
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:00,550
before he completely lost his mind.

78
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:01,620
General is lucky

79
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:02,680
and has a strong will.

80
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,620
Under your stimulation,

81
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:04,820
he has survived

82
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:07,750
by forcing out the poison insect blocking his heart.

83
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:08,820
The doctor said

84
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,090
that he would recover after some rest.

85
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:12,290
You can rest assured.

86
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:14,260
That's good.

87
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,590
That's good.

88
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:19,620
Well,

89
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:21,550
I should leave then.

90
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:24,320
You're injured.

91
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:26,820
It's been taken care of.

92
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,990
It's not a big deal.

93
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,050
An Chen,

94
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:40,820
wait a second.

95
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:50,640
I'll tell you a story

96
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:54,760
before you decide whether to leave or not.

97
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:07,040
After witnessing his father being killed

98
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:09,390
by that woman from Southern Jiang,

99
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,560
General became completely different.

100
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:14,980
From then on, he couldn't go near women.

101
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,740
Even being touched by a woman,

102
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:19,470
he would have red rashes all over his body.

103
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:21,220
For so many years,

104
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:24,860
you're the only one he has opened his heart to.

105
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:31,580
You look great

106
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,480
in women's dress.

107
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:39,580
I'm sorry.

108
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:41,600
I lied to you.

109
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:47,450
I just tried to get my task done in exchange for freedom.

110
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:52,730
You gave me many opportunities,

111
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,570
but I failed you.

112
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:01,070
I'm the one who got you hurt.

113
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:10,520
It's not your fault.
