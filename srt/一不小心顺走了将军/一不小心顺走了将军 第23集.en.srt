Congratulations.

You threaded six needles.

Wish you all the best.

You may go to Li's Restaurant

to have a bowl of beef noodles for free.

Do you like that?

Yes.

16
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,490
It's difficult to thread all ten needles.

17

Sir, would you like to try?

18

I said

In the battlefield,

I had to sew my own clothes.

I could do this long ago.

Yes.

55
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,920
that peach blossom show is very beautiful.

57
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:10,690
Yes.

58

I think you look very beautiful.

59

It's so beautiful.

60

I know you like something bright and shiny.

61

With these two lanterns in front of the gate,

62

If Lie Yun isn't be killed,

my mission

108

is to kill you.

We grew up together

110
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,320

111

to get here.

112

After accomplishing this mission,

113
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:31,990
you'll be truly free.

You don't want to kill Lie Yun.

00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:52,450
I don't want to kill you either.

We grew up together.

119

I would do anything for you.

120
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:00,810
I would risk my life for you.

121

But now,

122
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,820
you would rather die for a man.

123
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,270
Is it worth it?

124
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,410
As you wish then.

125
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:02,500

00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:05,690
