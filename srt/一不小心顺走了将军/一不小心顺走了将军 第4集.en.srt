[Episode 4]

4
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,420
How dare you

5
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:42,280
hit my face!

6
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:54,250
Protect General.

7
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:55,920
Just come at me.

8
00:00:58,550 --> 00:00:59,650
Keep yourself away!

9
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:01,760
If you come any closer

10
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:03,750
I'll kill her.

11
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:06,450
Threats never work on me.

12
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:07,890
Come on.

13
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:09,810
Just kill her.

14
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:11,850
General.

15
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:13,780
I'm loyal to you.

16
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:16,060
Please don't watch me die!

17
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:18,620
What's there to be afraid of?

18
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:20,350
She won't kill you.

19
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:26,850
Mei,

20
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:28,950
are you for real?

21
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,120
I'm acting.

22
00:01:32,789 --> 00:01:33,720
Focus yourself.

23
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:37,020
General.

24
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:39,310
General.

25
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:40,250
He's useful.

26
00:01:40,509 --> 00:01:42,509
Don't kill my savior.

27
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:45,680
The general's insane.

28
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:46,850
Stop!

29
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:49,479
Back off!

30
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:51,020
All of you!

31
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:51,950
Move.

32
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:53,250
Stay there!

33
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:58,150
General,

34
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,420
help me.

35
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:02,450
General!

36
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:04,950
Don't come over.

37
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,190
Everyone, stay put.

38
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:08,050
Come on.

39
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:10,979
This is kind of a scene.

40
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:13,080
It's all because of your stupid idea.

41
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:13,980
What to do now?

42
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:14,950
What other choice do we have?

43
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:15,850
Just keep acting.

44
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:16,790
Move!

45
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:18,050
Get out of the way!

46
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:18,590
General!

47
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:19,820
General, help me, please.

48
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:20,380
Step aside!

49
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:22,150
General!

50
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:23,650
General, help!

51
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:25,180
Stay where you are,

52
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:25,820
otherwise,

53
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:27,050
I'll kill her right away.

54
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:28,890
Go.

55
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:30,480
You can't run away.

56
00:02:52,579 --> 00:02:55,290
Keep acting.

57
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:02,080
No!

58
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,090
General,

59
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:32,050
the runaway assassin

60
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:34,350
made it to the liaison station of the Anhun Pavilion in the city.

61
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,750
Anhun Pavilion.

62
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:40,110
Anhun Pavilion

63
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,750
is an assassin organization unattached  to any country.

64
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:44,150
Its rules are rigid

65
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:45,390
and inhuman.

66
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:47,250
It's money-oriented

67
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:49,250
and do anything for anyone for money.

68
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,690
It must be taken seriously.

69
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:53,280
The first crisis is

70
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:54,829
the insect poison

71
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,329
to weaken my strength.

72
00:03:58,579 --> 00:03:59,920
The second is

73
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:02,450
the women expecting me at the city gate

74
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:04,790
to sound out my weakness.

75
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:07,150
And the third is

76
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:09,550
Anhun Pavilion?

77
00:04:20,649 --> 00:04:21,390
He feels soft.

78
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,490
Is he actually a woman?

79
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,590
But why I didn't have any allergic reaction?

80
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:29,110
General,

81
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,720
An Chen's identity is

82
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:32,280
easily suspicious.

83
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:33,950
Should we get him caught for an interrogation?

84
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:35,690
Isn't he the one who

85
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,280
caught the assassin of the Anhun Pavilion?

86
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,080
How come...

87
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:44,690
No need to do so.

88
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:46,890
Even if he's from the Anhun Pavilion,

89
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:50,050
he's just a pawn of the one behind.

90
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:52,510
Such a meticulous plan and a big gesture

91
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:54,650
show his ambition.

92
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:56,520
Keep An Chen here,

93
00:04:57,850 --> 00:04:59,450
and we can play a long game.

94
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:01,880
Don't act rashly and alert the enemy.

95
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:04,150
Yes.

96
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:07,720
Qi,

97
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:10,180
what do you think?

98
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:12,780
In my opinion,

99
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:15,080
General, the acupuncture

100
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,450
will greatly help you

101
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:17,650
recover from the poison.

102
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:20,310
But the poison is virulent.

103
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:22,720
You've got to work on your fitness,

104
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,050
and don't overwork yourself.

105
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:27,150
I'll find the cure for you as soon as possible.

106
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:50,390
Attendant An,

107
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:51,550
are you there?

108
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:52,750
Who is it?

109
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,050
It's not working time.

110
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:55,980
I'm sleeping.

111
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:57,110
Come here tomorrow.

112
00:05:57,850 --> 00:05:58,880
If you're sleeping,

113
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,550
how can you answer me?

114
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,590
I'm not here to ask you to work.

115
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:04,110
I have a favor to ask you.

116
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:05,520
Please open the door.

117
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:07,520
A favor to ask me?

118
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:09,250
What can I do someone a favor

119
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:11,350
in the mansion?

120
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:17,690
Who are you?

121
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:20,180
I'm Wang Ziming,

122
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:21,790
a bodyguard in the mansion.

123
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:22,450
From now on,

124
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:23,950
we'll be working together here.

125
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:26,250
So you're a bodyguard here.

126
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:27,680
Nice to meet you.

127
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:29,650
What's the matter?

128
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:31,520
I heard people say

129
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:32,680
assassins were seen in the street yesterday

130
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,520
and they even

131
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:34,680
showed up here today.

132
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,050
They almost hurt General.

133
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,720
It's one of his admirers

134
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,850
who risked his life

135
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:39,750
and saved him.

136
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:41,250
I'm very impressed.

137
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:43,080
So I always wanna make a visit to the hero.

138
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:45,950
So you're the one

139
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:48,150
who saved General twice, aren't you?

140
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:50,110
You flatter me.

141
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:52,750
It's me.

142
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:56,120
You're indeed very slim.

143
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:57,350
Good.

144
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:58,450
Great!

145
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,050
I heard

146
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:04,250
you're appointed as

147
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:05,180
the personal servant of General.

148
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:06,650
You're so lucky.

149
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:08,850
-Being a personal servant is lucky?
-I want

150
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:11,150
You're such a good-for-nothing.

151
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:12,320
Alright, just go.

152
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,550
I'm not in the mood for your endless chatter.

153
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:14,050
Attendant An,

154
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,050
well,

155
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:15,910
I wanna...

156
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:17,220
You want nothing.

157
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:17,880
Just go away.

158
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:18,780
I'm going to sleep.

159
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:19,910
Attendant An.

160
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:26,850
Attendant An,

161
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:28,680
I'll come to you later.

162
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,050
Gold.

163
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:49,650
It's mine. All mine.

164
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:51,150
Gold.

165
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:57,450
Gold.

166
00:07:57,850 --> 00:07:59,380
It's my gold.

167
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:04,950
An Chen.

168
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:07,350
An Chen.

169
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:09,580
An Chen.

170
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,180
Coming, I'm coming.

171
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,490
It's so early.

172
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:22,690
As the General's attendant,

173
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:24,280
you got up later than him.

174
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:25,490
If you're in the military camp,

175
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:26,950
you'll get your butt whipped.

176
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:29,120
Go serve General, now.

177
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:32,580
Hurry.

178
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:05,250
Get me changed.

179
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:08,050
You.

180
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:10,950
Me?

181
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:12,210
It's your privilege

182
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:13,310
to change clothes for General.

183
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:01,120
Where's the sachet?

184
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:02,510
Why can't I find it?

185
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,750
He's gentle.

186
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:11,120
Still no allergic reactions.

187
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:21,980
You've been groping for a while.

188
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:23,910
Are you happy?

189
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:25,390
How come I find nothing?

190
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:30,150
General, you practice martial arts all day long

191
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:31,680
and have a perfect figure.

192
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:34,650
You're the idol of all men.

193
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:35,880
In my eyes,

194
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:37,080
you're like

195
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,420
a deity descending from Heaven

196
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:39,550
to save the living creatures.

197
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:40,750
You have a valiant and heroic bearing,

198
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:41,980
stately and handsome.

199
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:56,050
From your words,

200
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:58,850
I guess you'll fall for me

201
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,780
if you're a woman.
