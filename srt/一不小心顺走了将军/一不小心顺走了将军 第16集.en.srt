[Episode 16]

4
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,330
His Majesty personally led the army

5
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:39,820
but was trapped in the military formation.

6
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:40,250
What?

7
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:41,220
Father…

8
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:46,150
How is His Majesty?

9
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:47,760
His Majesty was rescued eventually

10
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,620
but suffered from severe injury.

11
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:54,190
Lie Yun.

12
00:00:57,290 --> 00:00:58,890
How is His Majesty right now?

13
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:00,750
His Majesty is resting in the palace.

14
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:02,790
Although the imperial doctors have exhausted all treatments,

15
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:04,650
His Majesty languishes in coma.

16
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:06,220
The crown prince and the third prince

17
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:08,680
are looking after His Majesty in the palace.

18
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:12,420
Sure enough.

19
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:16,690
With the care of two lineal sons,

20
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,460
His Majesty should be fine.

21
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:22,760
Go ahead with the plan.

22
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:23,950
Yes.

23
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:37,729
What should I do?

24
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,780
Anyway, save An Mei first.

25
00:01:59,050 --> 00:01:59,850
Oh no.

26
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:14,390
Arrest him and take him away!

27
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:15,050
-Yes.
-Yes.

28
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:18,480
Go.

29
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:41,350
Unexpectedly,

30
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:44,390
it is you.

31
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:45,950
General,

32
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:46,920
please allow me to explain.

33
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,380
It's not what you thought.

34
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:49,560
So, what is it?

35
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:53,650
You didn't try to steal the Deployment Map,

36
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:55,790
or you weren't the spy?

37
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:56,890
I…

38
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,760
I…

39
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:06,990
General,

40
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,590
all of these were found in his room.

41
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,520
Anhun Token.

42
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,520
You are from the Anhun Pavilion.

43
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:30,150
Are there more secrets that I don't know?

44
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:33,260
I admit the Anhun Token is mine.

45
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:36,530
I was employed to steal the Deployment Map.

46
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:38,290
But I've never ever hurt you.

47
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:45,380
[Token]

48
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,550
This poison insect Token

49
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,850
can mobilize all the poisoners.

50
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:55,360
It is the most lethal weapon.

51
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:58,390
The insect poison inflicted damage on me.

52
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:01,720
How can you say you didn't hurt me?

53
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:05,980
[Token]

54
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:05,950
No,

55
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:07,720
I didn't.

56
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,530
I have no idea about the poison insect Token.

57
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:10,660
Please trust me.

58
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:12,460
I haven't told even a single lie.

59
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,020
Evidence here.

60
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:28,190
Can you insist you didn't lie to me?

61
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,260
You are a woman.

62
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:35,850
You have been lying to me from the very beginning.

63
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:37,850
Until now, you are still lying to me!

64
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:45,090
I won't trust any word of you.

65
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:46,890
You are a spy from the Southern Jiang.

66
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:48,659
Stop calling me that.

67
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:51,330
I'm not from the Southern Jiang.

68
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,590
I don't know my family background.

69
00:04:58,659 --> 00:05:01,250
I don't even know my parents.

70
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:04,060
I'm an orphan.

71
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:08,290
I've been trained as a tool by the Anhun Pavilion since childhood.

72
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:10,320
The Anhun Pavilion affiliates to no country.

73
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,090
I have nothing to do with the Southern Jiang.

74
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:13,750
Why can't you trust me?

75
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:22,890
I should have killed you.

76
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:28,120
But you don't deserve my killing.

77
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:38,320
General.

78
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:39,730
General.

79
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:41,060
General, I can explain.

80
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,890
I harbor no intention to hurt you.

81
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:45,159
Lie Yun.

82
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:46,120
Lie Yun.

83
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,520
Please trust me.

84
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,930
Take her away

85
00:05:58,960 --> 00:05:59,960
and imprison her.

86
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:01,260
Lie Yun.

87
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:02,790
Please listen to my reasons, Lie Yun.

88
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:04,920
Lie Yun, it's not what you thought.

89
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:06,750
Lie Yun, please trust me.

90
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:07,990
Lie Yun.

91
00:06:58,530 --> 00:06:59,250
Let go of me.

92
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:00,920
I want to see General.

93
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:05,150
Let me go.

94
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:07,060
I want to see General.

95
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,490
Set me free.

96
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:09,760
Shut up.

97
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:11,760
You spy don't deserve to see General.

98
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:12,990
Let go of me.

99
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:14,590
I want to see General.

100
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:16,120
Let me go.

101
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:16,860
How about…

102
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:18,360
-Set me free.
-we go over there

103
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,450
and teach her how to shut up?

104
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:20,800
Let go of me.

105
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:28,020
Jiang…

106
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,920
Is anyone there?

107
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,090
I want to see General.

108
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:36,120
Is anyone there?

109
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,560
I want to see General.

110
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:39,090
Is anyone there on earth?

111
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:39,890
Huh?

112
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,960
He won't see you.

113
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,960
I knew it was you.

114
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:50,280
You threatened me with the life of An Mei,

115
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:52,520
and then asked people to guard outside the door

116
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,320
so that Lie Yun could catch me.

117
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:57,320
Mr. Jiang, you're surprisingly cunning.

118
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,090
You took the bait voluntarily.

119
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:03,260
You have been lurking in the Mansion for years.

120
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:05,990
Why did you employ me to steal the Deployment Map?

121
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:10,330
So, you do remember your task.

122
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:12,990
During these years,

123
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,330
but for tools like you

124
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:18,330
who have distracted his attention,

125
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:21,290
how could I disguise my identity for so long?

126
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:24,920
I thought when you succeeded in the task,

127
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:27,560
I would send Lie Yun to the hell

128
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,960
and achieve all my goals.

129
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:30,790
However,

130
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:36,190
you began dreaming to be his wife.

131
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:37,860
An Chen,

132
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:42,750
you are a completely useless loser.

133
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,159
You are the loser.

134
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:48,390
No wonder

135
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:51,390
you've been luring here all these years.

136
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:54,710
I guess you don't even know where the Deployment Map is.

137
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,190
In this world,

138
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:01,850
Lie Yun is the only one who knows where the map is.

139
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:10,890
But soon enough,

140
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:13,920
I will hear it from his lips.

141
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:17,460
What are you going to do with him?

142
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:22,020
What am I going to do?

143
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:24,960
Do you really believe

144
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,420
I've been treating his disease these years?

145
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:32,520
But look at you.

146
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:36,160
Shouldn't you worry about yourself?

147
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:38,590
I'm not your real target.

148
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:43,290
By the way,

149
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,760
I'm grateful to you.

150
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,320
I thought you were a complete loser.

151
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:52,560
But Lie Yun

152
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:54,920
treats you as a treasure.

153
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:58,250
He is out of his mind for you.

154
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:01,730
He gets angry because of you.

155
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:02,720
Right now,

156
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:05,490
the last step.
