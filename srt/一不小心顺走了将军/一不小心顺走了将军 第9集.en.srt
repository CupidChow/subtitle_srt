00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:39,680
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

5
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:47,190
General,

6
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:49,350
you're good at drinking.

7
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:52,090
I admire you.

8
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:55,250
Stop...

9
00:00:57,690 --> 00:00:58,890
Stop swaying.

10
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:01,860
General,

11
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:03,890
I must tell you something

12
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,650
from the bottom of my heart.

13
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:08,090
Look at you.

14
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:09,060
You're very

15
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,420
young, handsome,

16
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:14,310
and have a successful career,

17
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:18,090
but your mansion

18
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:20,520
is very deserted.

19
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:23,120
There are only trees

20
00:01:23,789 --> 00:01:24,590
and grasses

21
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:26,850
without any flowers.

22
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:29,850
Look at the tiles on the roofs.

23
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:34,020
People could tell you keep fighting at one glance.

24
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:36,320
It's not like a home.

25
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:41,020
If it were my home,

26
00:01:41,289 --> 00:01:42,390
I would plant

27
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:44,830
rows of cherry trees.

28
00:01:47,289 --> 00:01:48,759
Their petals would fall

29
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:50,910
after being blown by the wind,

30
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:53,289
and I would feel very happy.

31
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:05,520
By the way,

32
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:10,289
I have a gift for you.

33
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:19,290
It matches with your sword, doesn't it?

34
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:25,990
It's pretty.

35
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:27,720
Come on.

36
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:28,760
Cheers.

37
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:38,420
General.

38
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:39,860
General, you're drunk,

39
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:41,990
so I'll send you back to your bedroom first.

40
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:43,020
I'm not drunk.

41
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:44,930
Not at all.

42
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:46,550
Let me send you back first.

43
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:47,720
I must do.

44
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:48,120
No need.

45
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,120
General.

46
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,520
I've never drunk that much.

47
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,820
Since my childhood,

48
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:02,690
I've been following the example of my father

49
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:05,660
and setting strict demands on myself as a general.

50
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:08,120
I've never gotten relaxed.

51
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:11,150
Since I was young,

52
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:12,390
other than my...

53
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:15,690
my sister,

54
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,790
no one has thought highly of me.

55
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:19,890
They said I was bad at everything

56
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,590
and always ran away.

57
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,190
But I've changed now

58
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,060
because I make a friend

59
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:27,290
with you who are very powerful.

60
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:28,290
If I go back home,

61
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:30,620
I swear that I'll show off to them.

62
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:35,520
You're at good at cooking.

63
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:40,750
I've arrived.

64
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:41,550
I've arrived.

65
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:34,790
My god.

66
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:37,060
I'm good at drinking,

67
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:40,590
but he almost got me drunk,

68
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:42,850
although it was his first time drinking.

69
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:47,350
Fortunately, I took hangover medicine in advance.

70
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:04,060
How could he have such an exquisite sachet

71
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:06,720
since he doesn't get along with women?

72
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:09,630
If it wasn't given by his lover,

73
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:11,620
there must be

74
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:13,930
a secret in it.

75
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:17,030
Let me check it

76
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,590
when he's drunk.

77
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:25,320
General, listen to me. I...

78
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:27,030
I'm better

79
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:29,230
at drinking than you.

80
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:36,720
Let me go.

81
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:38,090
Let me go.

82
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:43,820
Well,

83
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:46,820
I only got an order for stealing,

84
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:49,720
and I didn't agree to sell myself.

85
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:29,460
Oh no,

86
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:31,530
why did I fall asleep?

87
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,820
I'm sure that last night...

88
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:37,690
Why didn't the hangover medicine work?

89
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:45,730
Where am I?

90
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,520
What happened?

91
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:52,320
My god.

92
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,120
I made a mistake after drinking.

93
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:05,620
Why hasn't she woken up yet?

94
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,090
Why hasn't he woken up yet?

95
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:18,430
An Chen, why did you oversleep again?

96
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:23,120
-Because of him.
-Because of her.

97
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,380
Just pretend that I didn't see anything.

98
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:33,860
Vice General Xiao

99
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:35,850
won't say it out, will he?

100
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:37,120
My soldiers

101
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:39,320
can keep the secret.

102
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:44,590
An Chen and General...

103
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:53,490
General, listen to me.

104
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:55,620
I'm used to shouting when training the soldiers,

105
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:57,480
so when I faced that situation...

106
00:07:58,890 --> 00:07:59,990
Shut up.

107
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,590
Do the Horse Stance in the yard for an hour.

108
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:03,790
Reflect on yourself.

109
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:06,660
Yes.

110
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:09,260
Wait.

111
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:13,420
How about the mission I asked you to do?

112
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:16,090
I wanted to report to you today.

113
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:16,780
The PE class

114
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:18,050
has been experimented officially

115
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:19,430
in the schools of the city.

116
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:19,990
Besides,

117
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:20,590
you've mentioned to enhance

118
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:23,590
the physical training on the soldiers in the mansion.

119
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:24,530
And this is the list

120
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:26,320
of those who have poor physical

121
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,320
capability.

122
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:30,830
Our Lie family won't keep weak soldiers,

123
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:32,690
so train them as soon as possible.

124
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:34,220
If you fail...

125
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,419
I'll kill myself to apologize.

126
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:44,920
General,

127
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:47,190
there is another thing.

128
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:49,650
Mr. Jiang came to you this morning.

129
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:50,820
Qi?

130
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:52,920
Right.

131
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:54,720
Yesterday, we made an agreement to play chess today.

132
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,290
Should I

133
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:56,850
go to invite Mr. Jiang now?

134
00:08:58,290 --> 00:08:59,090
Forget it.

135
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:00,890
I'll go to him in person

136
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:03,620
after I finish dealing with military affairs.

137
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,420
How many people

138
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:15,630
heard that thing this morning?

139
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:17,590
This morning?

140
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:21,990
Do you mean the thing happened

141
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:23,320
between you and An Chen?

142
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:27,990
Don't worry.

143
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:28,990
The servants in the mansion

144
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:30,520
are tight-lipped.

145
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:31,390
Are you sure?

146
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,390
Yes.

147
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:33,990
I promise.
