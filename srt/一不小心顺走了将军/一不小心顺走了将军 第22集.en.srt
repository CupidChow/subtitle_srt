00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,750
You are dressed in my style?

5
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:54,420
You care so much about me,

6
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:57,610
paying attention to what I wear every day.

7
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:02,320
Are you so eager to look like a couple with me?

8
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:07,720
General Lie,

9
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:09,580
this morning

10
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:11,650
you wore a training suit.

11
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:13,950
You've changed it so quickly.

12
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:20,650
How do I know what you would wear?

13
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:24,360
Why do I care so much about you?

14
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,850
But General Lie,

15
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:30,520
your clothes

16
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:32,180
look so old

17
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:33,350
and wrinkled.

18
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:35,380
Moreover,

19
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:38,120
the color is not good for you,

20
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:40,110
making your skin look dark.

21
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:50,120
Help me change it back.

22
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:25,520
Wow!

23
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,150

26
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,720
These are all my favorites.

27
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:33,750
You cooked for me before.

28
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:35,850
Today, it's my turn

29
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:37,250
to give you a surprise.

30
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:47,420
With such a beautiful view at the moment

31
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,120
and with such a handsome man,

32
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,890
I'm really surprised.

33
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:55,920
If you like,

34
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:58,820
we can come here often.

35
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:00,050
Yeah.

36
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,790
When we have a child,

37
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:06,950
we can take him here to eat and practice martial arts.

38
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,120
What?

39
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:11,250
Nothing.

40
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,990
Hearing you say that,

41
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,150
I'm a bit

42
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:16,720
surprised.

43
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:18,550
Why?

44
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:20,620
Don't you want to have a child with me?

45
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:21,550
Of course I do.

46
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:22,550
I

47
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,420
even thought about the name of our child.

48
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:26,520
What is it?

49
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:29,320
If we have a son,

50
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,390
we would call him Lie Youcai,

51
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,820
symbolizing fortune,

52
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:34,180
no worry about food and clothing.

53
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:36,050
If we have a girl, I would call her

54
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:37,490
Lie Ruyu,

55
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:39,520
symbolizing pure skin

56
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,780
and a prosperous life.

57
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:42,450
How

58
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:44,280
can you give such names?

59
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:46,090
It's our child

60
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:47,420
but not a cat or dog.

61
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:50,690
I think these are good names.

62
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:52,290
Then what's your idea?

63
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:53,420
Well,

64
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:55,550
I would name him Lie Weiguo,

65
00:03:55,579 --> 00:03:56,990
symbolizing protecting the family and country.

66
00:03:56,990 --> 00:03:58,990
That's the kind of men of Lie Family.

67
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:02,950
Are you serious about it?

68
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:05,020
Then what if it's a girl?

69
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:07,160
Do you still call her Weiguo?

70
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,450
Weiwei?

71
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:10,350
Or Guoguo?

72
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:12,620
No, no, no.

73
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:15,380
I'm afraid that she would blame me for that.

74
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:21,250
If it's a boy,

75
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,820
let's call him Qihong,

76
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:25,120
meaning lofty ambition

77
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:26,950
and a safe and auspicious life.

78
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:30,620
Well, if it's a girl,

79
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:32,150
let's call her Zhitao,

80
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:33,580
meaning peach blossom and luck,

81
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:34,780
and a brilliant life.

82
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:37,050
I also wish her

83
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:37,890
a safe, happy

84
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:38,750

has strict regulations.

104

avenge you.

106

Counting on others

107
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,820

Lying on gold and counting gold

177
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:12,880
♫Won't change my heart♫

178
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:12,040
is my lifelong dream.

179
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:17,350
♫Going crazy, laughing and crying with you♫

180
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:20,520
♫Spending happy time with you♫

181
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,100
Whatever your dream is,

182
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:24,640
♫Forever♫

183
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:24,480
I'll help you achieve it.
