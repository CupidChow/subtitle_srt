9
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:10,910
What's wrong?

10
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,610
I'm thinking

11
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:16,320
how wonderful it would be if time

12
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,300
could stop at this moment!

13
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:20,560
Let's eat

14
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,180
before it's getting cold.

15
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:33,450
Do you really want me to eat these?

16
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:35,060
Um...

17
00:02:35,829 --> 00:02:37,630
Doesn't the food agree with you?

18
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:38,600
Or would you

19
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,760
like me to cook some other for you?

20
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:44,070
I'll eat whatever you cook.

21
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:26,350
You're getting better and better at cooking.

22
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:46,040
Honey.

23
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,520
Can you kiss me again?

24
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:27,040
An Chen,

25
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:30,030
just one word,

26
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:33,650
and I'll do anything for you.

27
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:06,550
Are you happy?

28
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,900
To achieve your purpose,

29
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,570
you applied poison on you lips.

30
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,010
You won't hesitate to

31
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,770
sacrifice yourself.

32
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:23,920
You've never loved me.

33
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:39,350
I love you.

34
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,450
But I love myself more.

35
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,830
Tell your master,

36
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:05,290
Lie Yun was poisoned

37
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:06,940
and has lost all his strength.

38
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:08,070
He can come to pick up

39
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,490
the thing he wants.

40
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:20,920
Brilliant!

41
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:24,670
No wonder people say the women of Anhun Pavilion are cruel.

42
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,050
For yourself,

43
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:28,880
you will do anything.

44
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:09,210
We agreed to

45
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,880
inquire about the map rather than kill him.

46
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:13,270
Why?

47
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,560
Do you feel sorry for him now?

48
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:17,530
Don't worry.

49
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,970
This is the truth venom.

50
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:21,030
He only needs to tell me

51
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:22,850
where the Deployment Map is.

52
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:24,340
It won't kill him.

53
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:06,440
An Chen,

54
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,460
you tricked me.

55
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:14,220
If you believe me,

56
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:15,490
cooperate with me.

57
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:18,950
Don't forget the order of Anhun Pavilion.

58
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,460
I'll let you die without a burial place.

59
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:23,360
I'll protect my woman.

60
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:25,830
Don't worry about her, Mr. Jiang.

61
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:35,559
Tell me.

62
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:37,659
What do you want?

63
00:08:41,539 --> 00:08:43,080
Cancel the task of Anhun Pavilion,

64
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,540
and we'll spare your life.

65
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:46,510
Fallen into your hands,

66
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:48,590
I don't expect to leave alive.

67
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:51,200
If you want me to cancel the task,

68
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:54,230
I have a condition.

69
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:55,560
Jiang Qi,

70
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:00,470
do you think you have the right to bargain with us?

71
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:03,720
You're aware of

72
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,020
the means of Anhun Pavilion.

73
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:07,880
If I don't cancel the task,

74
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:09,620
An Chen,

75
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:12,730
I'm afraid you'd rather die.

76
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:16,000
If you satisfy

77
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,260
the curiosity of a dying man,

78
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:20,600
the rest of An Chen's life will be spared.

79
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:22,060
It's worth it.

80
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:36,170
I'm listening.

81
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:39,070
The people of Southern Jiang

82
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:40,840
have lurked in all walks of life

83
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,540
and every corner of Rui Kingdom

84
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,270
generation after generation,

85
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,960
but they can't find the Deployment Map.

86
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:48,680
General Lie,

87
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:51,080
I want to know

88
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:54,570
where exactly the map is.

89
00:09:58,010 --> 00:09:59,470
I'm not afraid to tell you.

90
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,370
The Deployment Map both exists

91
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:03,910
and doesn't exist.

92
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:05,490
As a loyal family,

93
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:09,960
the map has been engraved in our minds for generations.

94
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:11,910
As for what you referred to,

95
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:13,850
it's just a piece of false information

96
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:15,460
to confuse our enemy.

97
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:20,940
Good.

98
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:23,260
The Lie Family of Rui Kingdom

99
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:26,090
is really superior in the stratagem.
