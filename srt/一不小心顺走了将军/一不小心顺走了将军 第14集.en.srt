[Episode 14]

4
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:36,990
Don't leave.

5
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:40,190
Stay with me in my room tonight.

6
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:55,450
Don't get me wrong.

7
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:57,160
Since you're still sick,

8
00:00:57,550 --> 00:00:58,680
if you go back alone,

9
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,920
the man in black might come again

10
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:02,960
and kill you.

11
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:04,920
Then my injury would be in vain.

12
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:05,590
Iâ€¦

13
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:07,890
I didn't get you wrong.

14
00:01:08,289 --> 00:01:10,220
General, please don't mistake me.

15
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:11,690
Mistake you for what?

16
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:12,920
You

17
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:14,720
can leave if you want to.

18
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:30,720
What is going on now?

19
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:32,320
Does he have a crush on me?

20
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:35,150
What was I talking about?

21
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:37,530
Why did I invite him to stay?

22
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,660
But it seems a good idea

23
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:40,720
for me to stay here.

24
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,250
Probably the unknown attacker

25
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:43,990
would break in again during the midnight.

26
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:44,520
Besides,

27
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:47,990
I can take the chance to search for the Deployment Map.

28
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:50,590
I'm just making sure he is under surveillance.

29
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:52,120
He's got ulterior motives.

30
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:53,420
I shouldn't give him any chance

31
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:54,680
to wander about alone.

32
00:01:55,289 --> 00:01:55,690
Right.

33
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:57,490
I've thought it through.

34
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:10,259
Ok.

35
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:11,660
I'll guard you

36
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:12,920
beside the bed tonight

37
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:13,920
with all my heart.

38
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,020
If you have any needs,

39
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:16,350
please feel free to order me.

40
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:17,120
I'll do whatever I can

41
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,760
to ensure your safety.

42
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,890
Don't count on your meager skills.

43
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:22,950
It should be the other way around.

44
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:24,990
You saved my life,

45
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,450
and I'll keep it deep in my mind.

46
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:27,050
This time,

47
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,520
it's my turn to protect you.

48
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,930
I'm as tiny as a mote,

49
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:30,960
and worth no attention.

50
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,160
But even if I must die,

51
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,390
I will still protect you

52
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:34,550
from the slightest injury.

53
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:35,720
You, An Chen,

54
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:37,290
are not a mote.

55
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:39,520
All people are created equal.

56
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:41,980
Your families and friends are behind you.

57
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:43,130
If you die,

58
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:45,520
they will feel heartbroken.

59
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,090
The lives of all people

60
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:49,350
are equally precious.

61
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:51,390
If we have to confront the enemy,

62
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:53,260
we'll face him bravely together.

63
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:00,950
Am I that important

64
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,320
in your mind?

65
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:16,350
You are clumsy,

66
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:18,150
and always bring me trouble.

67
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:20,320
You are not important to me.

68
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:31,720
Time to sleep.

69
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:48,020
Why does he stay inside

70
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:49,390
during the night?

71
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:54,360
What?

72
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,460
Are you not used to sleeping here?

73
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:56,890
No,

74
00:04:57,290 --> 00:04:57,550
no.

75
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:58,960
I'm good.

76
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,490
Do you know the identity

77
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:07,290
of that man in black?

78
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:07,850
No,

79
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:09,330
I don't.

80
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:12,620
General,

81
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:13,990
you should

82
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,720
cease sleeping in the study.

83
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,790
The bed in the study

84
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:18,450
is even harder than the floor.

85
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,160
The study houses important materials.

86
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:23,490
I need to keep a watch on them.

87
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,820
Important materials?

88
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:27,280
The Deployment Map?

89
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,350
No wonder last time I went to the study,

90
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:30,610
he got extremely wary.

91
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:19,490
Lie Yun,

92
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:21,490
you're asking for death.

93
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:43,850
General,

94
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:47,150
General,

95
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:48,760
are you asleep?

96
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,590
This sachet again.

97
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:12,290
He carries it with him even when injured.

98
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:12,930
Could it be

99
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:15,120
the authentic Deployment Map?

100
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:22,360
An Chen,

101
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:23,560
he treats you with sincerity,

102
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,890
saving you with his own life.

103
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:26,760
But this is how you repay his favor.

104
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,330
You cannot be ungrateful.

105
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,790
Since the floor is hard,

106
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:37,120
you can sleep on the bed.

107
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:46,159
Good.

108
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,860
You didn't let me down.

109
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:27,590
An Chen.

110
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:30,690
An Chen.

111
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:31,990
Yes.

112
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,320
Here I am.

113
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:37,289
General, you're awake.

114
00:08:37,289 --> 00:08:39,020
I was taking warm water for you.

115
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,850
Why didn't you inform me first?

116
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:42,990
Mr. Jiang suggests

117
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:44,460
you should have more rest to recover.

118
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:45,820
More sleep means faster recovery.

119
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:46,550
Here you are.

120
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:51,720
I still remember

121
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,490
somebody said he would do whatever he can

122
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:54,990
to ensure my safety yesterday.

123
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:56,260
But now,

124
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,520
I need to clean my face by myself.

125
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:29,850
How bumpingly inept!

126
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,290
They say I'm good at nothing

127
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:34,490
but fleeing.

128
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:36,120
I also excel at making a mess.

129
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,250
General, you just need to get used.

130
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:41,520
OK.

131
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:42,820
Today,

132
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:43,950
let me teach you

133
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:45,390
how to help others

134
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:46,390
clean their faces.

135
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:46,720
No.

136
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:47,330
General.

137
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:47,660
Stop.

138
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:51,750
General, please stop.

139
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:53,860
General!

140
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:54,760
Bad news!

141
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:57,020
Oh man.

142
00:09:57,190 --> 00:09:58,390
General,

143
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:00,450
would you please be more serious?

144
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:48,990
General.
