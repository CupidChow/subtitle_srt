General,

to please a girl,

6
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:41,120
a bunch of flowers is not enough.

7
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:46,590
Are you telling me what to do?

8
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,450
Do you want to run more laps?

9
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:51,990
Don't be angry.

00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:16,160
You need to create a romantic atmosphere

14
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,490
and choose an appropriate place.

15
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:44,220
Yes,

16
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:45,390
this is the smell.

What are you doing here?

20
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:27,260
First,

21
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:28,990
it's to show your handsome appearance.

Every girl wants to meet her prince charming.

00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:37,520
I'm here for recovery.

26
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:39,060
I didn't expect

27
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:41,260
that I would meet a flower picker here.

28
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:42,620
I'm not. I…

29
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:45,660

00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,230
I have a gift for you.

This is…

32

You told me that

33
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:56,220
seeing the sachet makes you think of your mother.

34
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:58,320
I've put some herbs inside.

35
00:02:58,390 --> 00:02:59,050
Smell it.

36
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:00,450
Does it smell the same?

37
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:09,090
Thank you.

38
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:10,690

39

Attendant An,

41

it's time to change my dressing.

42
00:03:58,829 --> 00:03:59,620
Did it hurt?

43
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:04,690
Yes.

44
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:06,540
But it's worth it.

45
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,450
Every scar is a price

46
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:11,440
for peace in the Eastern Rui frontier

47
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,920
and for people to live in stability.

48
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:15,920
Every scar

49
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:18,140
is a medal.

50
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:26,630
When I was in Anhun Pavilion,

51
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,700
I just wanted to get my task done

52
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:31,910
and save money for freedom.

53
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:34,740
I never thought about

54
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:36,490
whether my task was good or bad

55
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:39,180
and whether it would hurt someone.

56
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,020
If I did give the deployment map

57
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:44,810
to that spy from Southern Jiang,

58
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,830
the peaceful and prosperous world

59
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:51,310
would be buried in my hands.

60
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,050
And no one could know

61
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:55,750
how many men

62
00:04:57,570 --> 00:04:59,590
would die in the battlefield.

63
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,000
But you didn't do it.

64
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:03,180
An Chen,

65
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:07,450
I know you're kind-hearted.

66
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,060
Even working for Anhun Pavilion,

67
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:13,690
you're not a cold-blooded assassin.

68
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,390
You want to live a stable life.

69
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,300
So, I'm sure you wouldn't do that.

70
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:21,400
Thank you.

71
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:24,760
You've shown me a bigger world.

72
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:28,710
You made me become a better person.

00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:37,410
♫Sweet dream♫

176
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:37,410
and see you every day

177
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,210
♫Stormy whether♫

178
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:39,490
would make me happy.

179
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:40,800
♫ Flying dust and clouds♫

180
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,100
♫Won't change my heart♫

181
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:43,520
I'm too hasty.

182
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:47,910
♫Going crazy, laughing and crying with you♫

183
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:52,080
♫Spending happy time with you♫

♫Forever♫

185
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,010
Yes.

186
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:57,620
What did you say?
