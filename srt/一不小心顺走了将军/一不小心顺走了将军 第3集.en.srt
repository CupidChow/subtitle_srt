4
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:42,950
General,

5
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:44,390
one assassin was caught and

6
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:45,650
and

7
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:49,310
General,

8
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:50,650
thank god you're fine.

9
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:51,480
You don't know how much

10
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:52,690
I'm worried about you.

11
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:54,220
I've been one of your admirers for years.

12
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:55,890
When I pursued the assassin during the day,

13
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:57,760
I found she's up to no good.

14
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:00,050
I tailed her all the way to the General's Mansion

15
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:01,680
in case something happens to you

16
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,020
and knocked her out.

17
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:04,980
Ask him if you don't believe me.

18
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,210
He's telling the truth.

19
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:12,520
But...

20
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:15,820
I'm glad that

21
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:17,270
you're sound and fine.

22
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:18,289
So I can

23
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:19,720
take my leave.

24
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:20,820
Hero,

25
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:21,920
so long.

26
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:29,150
You risked your life to save me twice.

27
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:31,820
You deserve a reward.

28
00:01:33,979 --> 00:01:34,380
Um...

29
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:36,410
You're so welcome.

30
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:39,620
Well,

31
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:42,050
I can do with that

32
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:43,680
If you could reward me with

33
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:45,920
100 taels of gold.

34
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:53,920
I'll give you a chance

35
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,880
to earn 100 taels of gold.

36
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:02,820
I do need a personal attendant.

37
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:06,550
I think you're tailor-made for it.

38
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:07,880
I...

39
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:08,660
I...

40
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:12,210
Fine.

41
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,550

45
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,120
This is so cool!

46
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:58,610
Don't touch anything you shouldn't.

47
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:07,620
This is your overall.

48
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:10,580
Give it to me.

49
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:11,320
Let me

50
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,450
take it.

51
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:16,950
Since General keeps you here,

52
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:18,550
you're supposed to fulfill your role

53
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:20,810
and work your fingers to the bone for him.

54
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,290
Soldiers make regular patrols at night here.

55
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:26,020
You'd better watch out.

56
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:27,350
Or any carelessness

57
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:29,340
will make you the assassin,

58
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:30,910
and you'll be put to death on the spot.

59
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:33,079
Watch your mouth!

60
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:39,110
How come...

61
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,250
That's very kind of you to say that.

62

What you just said to me

64
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:44,790
sounds threatening,

65
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:47,079
but actually

66
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,720
it shows your concern for me.

67
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:53,720
It's a great privilege

68
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,280

78
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:32,860
Go away.

Take things as they come.

82
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:55,780
I'll find a chance to slip away.

83
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:36,920
Since you're here,

84
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:38,450
what's the rush to leave?

85

It's a pity that he's disabled.

E-excuse me.

89
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:10,510

97
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,150
kept you in the mansion

98
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:28,020

99
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:29,290
Well?

100
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:30,910
How are you settling in?

101
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,780
He specially kept me here?

102
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,820
That sounds...

103
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:38,390
Did he misunderstand the relationship between me and the general?

104
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:39,720
It's cold in the morning.

105
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,150
Wrap up warm.

106
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,110
Go get busy.

107
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:44,850
Yes.

108
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:55,050
Sir.

109
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:58,050
You and general are nice people.

110
00:06:58,409 --> 00:07:00,420
I'm just an attendant.

111
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:02,980
I'll never stand in the way between you two.

112
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:03,780
Mr. Jiang,

113
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:05,550
what other people say

114
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:06,710
doesn't matter.

115
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:08,650
You guys must be strong.

116
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:09,910
Hang in there!

117
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:19,850
Come on.

118
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:34,950
I feel sorry for the cute guy.

119
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:36,620
But...

120
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:38,950
Who is it?

121
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:40,180
Ge...

122
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:41,510
General.

123
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:43,610
Why are you up so early?

124
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:44,940
You're earlier than me.

125
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:47,510
I'm an attendant.

126
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:48,950
I can't slack off.

127
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:50,020
I'm ready to

128
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:51,380
pay respects to you.

129
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:53,190
You're just in time.

130
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:54,350
There's a big show

131
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:56,050
waiting for you to start by hitting the gong.

132
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:56,420
Well.

133
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:58,520
It's early in the morning.

134
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:00,450
Won't it gonna cause too much noise?

135
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:02,390
Well, the earlier the better.

136
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:03,110
Let's go.

137
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,790
Let go of me!

138
00:08:33,049 --> 00:08:33,850
Pick one.

139
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:37,580
How dare you!

140
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:50,080
I'm counting on you.

141
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,180
Thief,

142
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:54,520
if it weren't for you standing in my way constantly,

143
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,720
I would've made a brilliant departure.

144
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:58,520
You're so arrogant.

145
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:00,280
I'll let you know

146
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,650
what our general got.

147
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:09,020
Good choice.

148
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:12,120
The feather makes one

149
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,180
severely itchy

150
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:14,920
and suffer from a snotty nose.

151
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,320
I'm sure she'll confess.

152
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:22,420
Waist girdling is better.

153
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:23,580
Give it a pull

154
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:25,520
and she'll feel her waist tightened.

155
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,780
With a few pulls,

156
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:28,650
she'll have difficulty breathing

157
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:30,120
and die from the pain.

158
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:34,950
You think you're capable

159
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:36,350
by playing dirty tricks?

160
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:38,520
Bring it on!

161
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:41,180
I won't utter a cry of pain.

162
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,720
Come at me.

163
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:51,120
Confess!

164
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:52,810
Who's your confederate?

165
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:55,550
Do your job.

166
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:57,320
I'm watching.

167
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,150
My confederate

168
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:15,780
is a notorious jerk,

169
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:18,910
a faithless rat.

170
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:21,680
You don't

171
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:23,440
have the heart to do so?

172
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:35,180
If I ever run into her,

173
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:37,450
I'll spend all her money,

174
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:38,950
strip her skin and veins off,

175
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:40,380
tie her up on a stool,

176
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:42,510
and leave her starving for three days.

177
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:54,220
How dare you!
