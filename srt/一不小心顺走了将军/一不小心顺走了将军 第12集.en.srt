[Episode 12]

4
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:47,650
General,

5
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:49,920
An Chen is waiting outside to see you.

6
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:51,090
Why is he here?

7
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:52,960
He wants to…

8
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,020
I have no interest.

9
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:57,550
Didn't you ask me just now?

10
00:00:58,930 --> 00:00:59,990
Get him out of here!

11
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:02,120
Yes.

12
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:20,150
I'm going in right now.

13
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:21,660
No, General orders me

14
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:22,520
to get you away.

15
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:28,920
Did I do anything

16
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:30,690
that inflames him?

17
00:01:32,289 --> 00:01:33,530
I'm more confused than you.

18
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:34,720
Anyway, General says

19
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,720
he wants you gone.

20
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:36,500
No way.

21
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:39,530
I spent a lot of time and energy

22
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:41,259
making these dishes by myself.

23
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:51,060
Humph!

24
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:52,750
I'm done and gone!

25
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:02,090
What is wrong with you

26
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:03,460
from the early morning?

27
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:05,260
And what's wrong with me?

28
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:07,120
Why should it bother me this much?

29
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:08,949
I don't want to see you either!

30
00:02:09,259 --> 00:02:10,090
Out of sight, out of mind.

31
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:11,490
You won't have my dishes!

32
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:15,020
An Mei was indeed right.

33
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:15,990
No men

34
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:17,079
can be trusted.

35
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:18,790
Are you talking of me?

36
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,290
Who's there?

37
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:22,590
Where are you?

38
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:25,630
Here I am.

39
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,420
An Mei!

40
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:36,960
Would you please stop appearing

41
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:37,930
from nowhere suddenly?

42
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:38,960
You played a dancing girl last time,

43
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,020
and a gardener now.

44
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:42,190
Do I have other choices?

45
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:43,550
No females can be seen

46
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:45,010
in the General's Mansion.

47
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:46,360
After receiving your letter,

48
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,620
I exhausted all sorts of ways

49
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:49,079
to get here successfully.

50
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:52,980
Have you identified that man in black?

51
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:54,210
Not yet.

52
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:56,720
But I got a clear answer that

53
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,950
the Anhun Pavilion

54
00:02:58,430 --> 00:02:59,590
is not involved.

55
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:04,490
The man was sent neither by the Anhun Pavilion

56
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:06,020
nor Lie Yun.

57
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:08,530
Who else could it be?

58
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:13,490
The employer!

59
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:16,250
The only one who knows I'm stealing the Deployment Map,

60
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:17,780
beside the Anhun Pavilion,

61
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:19,730
is the person who employs me.

62
00:03:21,829 --> 00:03:25,290
Since the person dares to act boldly in the General's Mansion,

63
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,930
he must be very familiar with the Mansion.

64
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:32,520
Could he be a member of the Mansion?

65
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:34,079
How could this be possible?

66
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:36,680
Let's say if,

67
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:40,620
if this person

68
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,490
actually belongs to the General's Mansion,

69
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:44,820
why would he employ us two to steal the map?

70
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:49,390
There is something unusual.

71
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,290
An Mei,

72
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:52,660
you must return to the Pavilion now.

73
00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:56,690
Give me several days.

74
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:57,390
Wait for me.

75
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:01,450
Were you talking about

76
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,290
“men”, those stuff?

77
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,520
I just don't get it.

78
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,960
He treated me well several days ago,

79
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:09,760
but all of a sudden,

80
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,490
he turns a cold face to me today.

81
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:16,320
Whatever his reason is,

82
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:18,390
there is only one way

83
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:20,550
to attract the attention of a man.

84
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:21,740
Stir

85
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:22,430
him

86
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,180
deliberately.

87
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:36,610
Leave now.

88
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:56,000
Mr. Jiang.

89
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:57,780
How fortuitous.

90
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:58,659
You are also here.

91
00:04:58,659 --> 00:05:00,460
Mr. Jiang, are you taking a walk?

92
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:03,620
Taking a walk is too much.

93
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:05,290
I'm breathing some fresh air.

94
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,600
Sorry, Mr. Jiang.

95
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:11,040
I didn't mean to

96
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:13,210
bring up your handicapped legs.

97
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:13,870
Never mind.

98
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:16,360
I'm glad you can treat me

99
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,020
as a normal person.

100
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:19,390
Recently,

101
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:21,690
General has been busy with military affairs,

102
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:23,220
so, he might be in a bad mood.

103
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:25,040
Don't take it too seriously.

104
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,370
You have already known.

105
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:28,330
I didn't expect

106
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,410
you would be the one to comfort me.

107
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:32,740
Better than that prying and snobbish rat!

108
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:35,340
I still remember

109
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:36,540
the first time we met,

110
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,090
it was you who told me

111
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:40,070
to put these rumors

112
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:41,120
out of the mind.

113
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:42,860
But now as for you,

114
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:45,520
you are literally encased in mind.

115
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:45,890
I…

116
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:46,850
Because I…

117
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:49,600
This is human.

118
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:51,860
In the picture, we can't see the frame.

119
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:53,120
A fresh set of eyes

120
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,490
might help.

121
00:05:58,570 --> 00:05:59,420
You don't look

122
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:00,670
quite well.

123
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,370
Please try to get some rest.

124
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:03,460
Mr. Jiang, thanks for your care.

125
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:04,270
I might catch a cold

126
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:05,320
last night.

127
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:07,490
By the way,

128
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:08,390
Mr. Jiang,

129
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:08,950
these are the dishes

130
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:10,000
I made by myself.

131
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,250
If you don't mind,

132
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:13,110
please take them and have a taste.

133
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,280
Thank you.

134
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,140
I'm going back to have a rest then.

135
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:30,770
General,

136
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:32,140
if your mood

137
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:33,400
is not that beautiful,

138
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:34,520
taking a walk around the garden

139
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,180
is the most fitful way for you.

140
00:06:36,909 --> 00:06:38,570
Did I say I'm not in a good mood?

141
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:50,200
There seems to be a strand of

142
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:50,960
food aroma.

143
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:56,820
Qi!

144
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,860
It smells so good!

145
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:06,960
It turns out you are hiding here

146
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,290
enjoying a feast alone.

147
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,000
The Sour Cabbage and Fish

148
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:13,350
look quite palatable.

149
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:17,610
An Chen's cooking skills

150
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:19,020
expect my expectations.

151
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:21,210
It's so thoughtful of him

152
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:23,020
to have sent the dishes to me.

153
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:26,670
Did An Chen make these?

154
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:30,270
Did he send these

155
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:31,240
to you in person?

156
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,450
Yes.

157
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,230
He made a bowl of noodles for me,

158
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,600
and yet prepared such delicate dishes for you.

159
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:39,590
Xiao Tong,

160
00:07:40,409 --> 00:07:41,340
where is An Chen?

161
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:43,560
Didn't you order him

162
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,159
not to serve you by your side?

163
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:46,140
So,

164
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:47,680
I don't know his whereabouts.

165
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,730
I know.

166
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:49,820
He

167
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:51,020
went back to his room.

168
00:07:52,159 --> 00:07:53,450
As an attendant,

169
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:55,680
he dares to shirk his duty during the day.

170
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,280
Xiao Tong,

171
00:07:56,970 --> 00:07:57,909
ask him to come here

172
00:07:57,909 --> 00:07:59,270
and accompany me to the Training Site.

173
00:07:59,270 --> 00:07:59,760
Yes.

174
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,210
Wait.

175
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:04,850
I'm going to tackle him in person.

176
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,440
The Sour Cabbage and Fish

177
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:11,260
have the sourness of jealousy.

178
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:23,590
Coming.

179
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:28,360
An Chen,

180
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,570
you are the attendant

181
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:30,430
of our General.

182
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:32,309
How can you leave without permission?

183
00:08:32,309 --> 00:08:33,370
Accompany General

184
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:34,690
to the Training Site.

185
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:38,659
What's going on?

186
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:40,720
Hurry up!

187
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:43,990
Ok.

188
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,580
Let me take on a coat first.

189
00:08:58,490 --> 00:08:59,750
You are having a fever.

190
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,360
Xiao Tong.

191
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:04,390
Take Mr. Jiang here immediately.

192
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:04,830
Yes.

193
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:23,740
He catches a slight cold.

194
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:24,940
Not a severe disease.

195
00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:25,880
But the medicine

196
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,720
must be taken regularly.

197
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:39,940
General, don't worry.

198
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:42,120
I'll stay here to take care of him.

199
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:46,360
Qi.

200
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:49,190
You are already fully occupied.

201
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:50,560
Let me do this.

202
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:53,390
Yeah,

203
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:54,720
today

204
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,200
I'm indeed very busy.

205
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:58,120
Vice General Xiao,

206
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,290
would you

207
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:01,180
please offer me a hand?

208
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:02,400
Oh.

209
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:03,490
Yeah.

210
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:05,470
I'm also busy today.
