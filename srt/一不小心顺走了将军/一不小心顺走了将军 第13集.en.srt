You were aware of your injury,

154

but you still fought against the man for me.

155
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:53,860
No one else has protected me.

156

They all treat me as a burden

157
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:57,490
and a troublemaker.

158
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,390
At that time,

159
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:00,720
I thought I would be killed.

160
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:02,750
But you came for rescue.

161
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,290
Thank you.

162
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,950
If you continue hugging me tightly,

As my attendant,

Or here?

171

Move up a little bit.

172

Here?

173

You shouldn't eat chestnuts

178
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:07,120
at this very time.

179
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:16,920
I'm going to bring you some porridge

180
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:17,790
from the kitchen.

181
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:31,590
Don't leave.

182
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,390
Stay with me in my room tonight.
