[Follow My Dear General]

3
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:35,170
[Episode 10]

4
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:42,790
I heard

5
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:44,720
General has a new love.

6
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:46,120
Who is it?

7
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,720
An Chen, the new attendant.

8
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:48,790
Really?

9
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:50,630
He's so powerful.

10
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:58,550
But I'm still on Mr. Jiang's side.

11
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:00,890
He's gentle and handsome.

12
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:02,830
He's like a fairy.

13
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:04,420
Unfortunately,

14
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:05,590
he can't walk.

15
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:06,310
Otherwise,

16
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:08,650
he wouldn't let An Chen swoop in.

17
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:10,789
An Chen also looks handsome.

18
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:13,030
Although Mr. Jiang is modest,

19
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:15,289
he's so arrogant that makes him uneasy to be got along with.

20
00:01:15,289 --> 00:01:17,130
An Chen is very friendly.

21
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:18,650
Since he becomes General's new love,

22
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:20,420
he could speak well of us.

23
00:01:25,289 --> 00:01:26,090
Watch out.

24
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:37,920
Mr. Jiang.

25
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:39,460
Are you okay?

26
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:41,450
Oh no.

27
00:01:46,289 --> 00:01:47,289
Get out of my way.

28
00:01:57,390 --> 00:01:58,190
Sure enough,

29
00:01:58,420 --> 00:01:59,590
every lascivious general's servants

30
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:00,930
like gossiping.

31
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:06,690
My purity

32
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,490
and reputation

33
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:11,460
are completely ruined by him.

34
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:15,660
An Mei is unreliable,

35
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:18,050
and Anhun Pavilion is more unreliable.

36
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:19,510
I have to depend on myself.

37
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:36,690
Sir,

38
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:37,660
at least,

39
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,090
let me swallow the chestnut.

40
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:51,320
Don't forget your mission here.

41
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:55,220
Are you a taskmaster

42
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:56,950
sent by Anhun Pavilion?

43
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:58,990
I'll give you the last chance.

44
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:00,160
Trashes

45
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:02,690
will only be killed by me.

46
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:17,760
When did

47
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:19,190
Anhun Pavilion

48
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:22,590
start using taskmasters to supervise stealing tasks?

49
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,860
This man is highly skilled.

50
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:26,630
Lie Yun.

51
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:28,710
Could it be his test again?

52
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:50,690
Mr. Jiang.

53
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:53,720
Mr. Jiang.

54
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:56,329
Why are you in a panic?

55
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:57,030
Mr. Jiang,

56
00:03:57,290 --> 00:03:58,950
have you seen anyone strange?

57
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,430
No.

58
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:05,460
Mr. Jiang,

59
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:07,220
do you know where General is?

60
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:08,990
He's discussing affairs in the study.

61
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:10,350
I'm going to to feel the pulse palpation,

62
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:11,860
so I wait here.

63
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,590
General is in the study?

64
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:15,520
Then has him ever gone out?

65
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:16,920
No.

66
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,089
From the study

67
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:20,490
to my room,

68
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:22,220
he has to pass here.

69
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:23,650
Does it mean

70
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,580
that man isn't Lie Yun?

71
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:28,690
Qi.

72
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,820
General.

73
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:37,290
Why are you here?

74
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,190
I...

75
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:39,560
I come out

76
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,890
to take a walk.

77
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:45,750
I feel sleepy now,

78
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:47,230
so

79
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:48,330
I'm going back to sleep.

80
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:49,590
Are you sleepy now?

81
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,990
We got up at nine o'clock.

82
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:56,590
I...

83
00:04:57,390 --> 00:04:58,020
I...

84
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:00,090
I'm growing up,

85
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:01,880
so I'm easy to feel sleepy.

86
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:03,250
You're right.

87
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:05,030
You indeed have to grow up

88
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:06,320
since you're short.

89
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:08,710
Then...

90
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,380
Then...

91
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:10,620
I'll go back

92
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:11,790
to grow up.

93
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:13,220
Enjoy your talk.

94
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:14,620
Enjoy your talk.

95
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:15,610
Bye bye.

96
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:21,480
I'm sorry.

97
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:25,320
General,

98
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:26,960
I heard you drank.

99
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:29,650
I failed to keep the appointment yesterday,

100
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:31,590
so I specially come to apologize to you.

101
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:33,920
Let's play chess for a few rounds tonight.

102
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:35,020
I'm always ready.

103
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:41,570
[Dingnan General's Mansion]

104
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,120
She's a woman,

105
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,050
but I'm not allergic to her.

106
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:50,390
She's so special.

107
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:51,760
Did he

108
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,630
want to threaten me

109
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:57,520
or kill me?

110
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:01,220
But she's a spy sent by Anhun Pavilion,

111
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:02,650
so I can't like her.

112
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,180
Lie Yun was discussing affairs in the study,

113
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:12,990
so he didn't have time to do that.

114
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:16,650
Jiang Qi can't walk,

115
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:18,090
so it couldn't be him.

116
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,390
Xiao Tong?

117
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:24,490
It can't go on like this.

118
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:27,650
I have to keep distance from her.

119
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:31,050
If he isn't from the mansion,

120
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:33,590
could he be sent by Anhun Pavilion?

121
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,320
It doesn't make sense.

122
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:41,120
Why am I not allergic to her?

123
00:06:42,659 --> 00:06:44,690
Who is he?

124
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:47,320
What should I do?

125
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:03,110
My dear senior sister,

126
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:05,190
whether I can go back alive

127
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,890
depends on you.

128
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:07,920
General.

129
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:10,920
How

130
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,090
is An Chen?

131
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:14,120
General,

132
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,290
it's midnight,

133
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:18,320
so even if you want him,

134
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:20,460
you'd better control yourself.

135
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:24,090
Get out.

136
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:26,220
General,

137
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:27,630
should I

138
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:29,090
get out in this way

139
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:30,160
or this way?

140
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,730
I can't choose this way

141
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:32,419
because

142
00:08:32,419 --> 00:08:33,419
you know

143
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:34,260
I got my waist injured

144
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:35,690
in the battlefield.

145
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:37,190
But if I get out in this way...

146
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:38,190
Disappear

147
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:39,320
now!

148
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:40,289
Yes.

149
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:54,790
General,

150
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,460
you'll lose

151
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:58,390
if you put the chessman here.

152
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,430
Let's stop.

153
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:03,120
You're lucky today.

154
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:05,650
No, you're obviously absent-minded today.

155
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:09,860
I've had many military affairs to deal with recently.

156
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:10,430
Qi,

157
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:12,690
have you ever thought

158
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:14,190
the mansion is quiet?

159
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:16,590
Kind of.

160
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:19,550
After I finish working,

161
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:21,620
I want to decorate the mansion.

162
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:22,490
Good.

163
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,060
General,

164
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:29,790
what's this?

165
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:32,490
It's hung by An Chen.

166
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:36,230
You seem to treat him specially.
