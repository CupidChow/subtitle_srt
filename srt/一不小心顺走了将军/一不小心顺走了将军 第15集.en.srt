[Episode 15]

4
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:36,450
I can't believe so many years have passed,

5
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:39,850
but the Southern Jiang is still chasing after the Lie Family.

6
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:48,480
What they are truly chasing after

7
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:50,950
is the Deployment Map.

8
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,490
Lie Xiao,

9
00:01:15,289 --> 00:01:17,550
as long as you hand in the Deployment Map,

10
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:18,850
I'll spare your life.

11
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:24,050
The first time I met you,

12
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,820
you'd run away from the palace of the Southern Jiang.

13
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:29,150
I saved you back then.

14
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:31,539
But I didn't expect that

15
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:34,509
you'd eventually become their underlying.

16
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:37,150
Xiang Hongmei,

17
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:39,610
I shouldn't have trusted you.

18
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:42,710
I shouldn't have fallen in love with you.

19
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:43,289
You!

20
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:54,220
Yun!

21
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,289
Don't hurt my son!

22
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,150
Your target is me.

23
00:01:58,420 --> 00:01:59,220
Father.

24
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:01,850
Ok.

25
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,290
If you give up the Deployment Map,

26
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:05,350
I'll let him go.

27
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:10,720
Yun.

28
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:12,740
Are you scared?

29
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:16,480
Excellent.

30
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:20,050
We Lie Family have been loyal for several generations.

31
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:23,180
It's worthwhile to sacrifice our lives for the country.

32
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:25,120
You people,

33
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:29,220
the tiny Southern Jiang, attempts to challenge the great Rui Kingdom.

34
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:31,020
How ridiculous.

35
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:31,850
Youâ€¦

36
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:36,250
-What are you doing?
-Yun!

37
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:37,890
Don't forget your position.

38
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:39,020
If you waste more time,

39
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:40,420
the empress will not guarantee

40
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:42,220
the safety of the Second Prince.

41
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:45,990
Yao.

42
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:48,350
Old man,

43
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,420
you'd better tell us where the Deployment Map is.

44
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,420
Otherwise,

45
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:53,910
we'll skin your son!

46
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,380
The Lie Family disciplines dedicate

47
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,720
all the decadents

48
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,750
shall be loyal, valiant, heroic and filial

49
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,320
without any compromise.

50
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,650
Shut up!

51
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:06,320
Yun!

52
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:17,250
We'll guard the people of the Rui Kingdom

53
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:21,950
no matter what it takes.

54
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:23,510
Nasty boy!

55
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:25,420
No.

56
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:27,380
Stop.

57
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:28,190
No.

58
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,280
General,

59
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:30,910
would you bear to watch

60
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:32,750
your son suffering more hurt?

61
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:38,110
He needs to take his responsibility.

62
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:43,350
You can quit the meaningless trying.

63
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,450
You make this harder than it has to be.

64
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:50,820
Eat this poison insect from the Southern Jiang,

65
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:53,280
and let's see if you can keep your mouth shut.

66
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:01,690
Bastard, you bastard!

67
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:05,750
Xiang Hongmei.

68
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:08,150
My father treats you well.

69
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,350
Father.

70
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:23,680
Father.

71
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:28,350
Are you insane?

72
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:31,280
How can we torture him into giving in when he's dead?

73
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:34,850
Lie Xiao got an unflinching spirit.

74
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:36,650
Our torture would make no difference.

75
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:38,720
As long as we control his son,

76
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:40,980
we'll find out the Deployment Map.

77
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:52,420
Am I right?

78
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:54,020
Yun.

79
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:56,520
Father.

[Token]

81
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:15,220
Back then,

82
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:18,420
hadn't Vice General Ma and his army have arrived in time,

83
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:19,920
I'm afraid even you

84
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:22,320
might have been killed by them.

85
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:29,050
Xiang Hongmei died soon after she fled to the Southern Jiang.

86
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:29,880
But now,

87
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:32,020
this token shows up again.

88
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,420
Does it mean

89
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:37,170
there're spies from the Southern Jiang in our mansion?

90
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:41,890
I hope

91
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:44,250
she is not the spy.

92
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:54,280
Since he treats me in this way,

93
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:56,480
he must be into me.

94
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:02,220
No.

95
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:04,420
I'm now disguised as a male.

96
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:15,850
But I'm actually a female.

97
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:20,720
Why do I bother to think these things?

98
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:31,350
What if he does like me?

99
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,220
Mr. Jiang?

100
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:53,350
Mr. Jiang.

101
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,720
General asks me to send you some cakes.

102
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,620
Where is Vice General Xiao?

103
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:59,520
You shouldn't do these trivial things in person.

104
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,320
Never mind.

105
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:17,180
Such elegant person

106
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,490
must be what General likes.

107
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,720
Have a try.

108
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:22,690
OK.

109
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,780
Would you like to have a cup of tea?

110
00:07:50,159 --> 00:07:51,060
Here you are.

111
00:07:51,159 --> 00:07:51,950
Thanks.

112
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:06,890
It seems

113
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:09,460
you are not that stupid.

114
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:16,660
But I didn't try to conceal the truth from you.

115
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:22,790
Do not seize me by the throat this time.

116
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:23,450
Relax.

117
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:26,650
I won't kill you today.

118
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,220
Does it look familiar?

119
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:35,809
It's An Mei's bracelet.

120
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:38,350
What did you do to her?

121
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:41,490
You asked her to investigate me secretly.

122
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:44,490
Naturally, I should give her a special treat.

123
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,610
How dare you hurt my Senior Sister?

124
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:56,650
She is embroiled into the trouble by you.

125
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:59,920
If you injure me now,

126
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:02,710
I'll take my reprisal on her ten times more.

127
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:09,150
The Deployment Map is in the study.

128
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:10,450
Steal it tonight.

129
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:12,890
Who are you?

130
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:15,340
What on earth are you scheming?

131
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:16,610
I?

132
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:19,290
I'm the one who employs you.

133
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:23,290
Lie Yun has known your identity long before.

134
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:24,950
He is just selling the acting.

135
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,420
I can only wait for another night.

136
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:29,520
Give me the Deployment Map

137
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,820
in exchange for your Senior Sister.

138
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:43,920
Miss An,

139
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:48,080
I'll get out of your way then.

140
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:05,680
Your Highness,

141
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:07,480
The Lie's Army defeated our army

142
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,480
with the help of the Deployment Map.

143
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:11,290
I've got to know this

144
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,450
from the military report of Lie Yun.

145
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:16,750
Our time is running up.
