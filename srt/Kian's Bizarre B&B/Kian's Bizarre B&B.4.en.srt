00:00:25,066 --> 00:00:27,527
KIAN'S B&B
SLEEPING AREA

2
00:00:30,572 --> 00:00:31,656
SIGHS

3
00:00:33,074 --> 00:00:34,367
Unbelievable.

4
00:00:35,493 --> 00:00:36,995
TOP ROW WAKES UP

5
00:00:37,078 --> 00:00:38,913
SECOND ROW ALSO WAKES UP

6
00:00:38,997 --> 00:00:39,831
FIRST ROW TOO

7
00:00:39,914 --> 00:00:41,583
Why is it raining so much?

8
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:42,542
Oh, shoot.

9
00:00:44,794 --> 00:00:46,713
HIS ARM IS WET

10
00:00:46,796 --> 00:00:49,924
ABSOLUTE CHAOS

11
00:00:50,008 --> 00:00:51,509
Let's go back down.

12
00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:53,845
THE ONE WHO ESCAPES

13
00:00:53,928 --> 00:00:55,096
I want to go inside.

14
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:56,306
THE ONE UNABLE TO ESCAPE

15
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:58,850
THE ONE ENJOYING THE SITUATION

16
00:00:58,933 --> 00:01:00,393
Aren't you going inside?

17
00:01:00,977 --> 00:01:03,021
THE ONE NOT WAKING UP

18
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:07,275
Go sleep inside.

19
00:01:07,358 --> 00:01:09,235
THE ONE WAKING EVERYONE UP

20
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:11,738
Can you wake him up?

21
00:01:11,821 --> 00:01:13,156
HE MEANS SEONG-EUN

22
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:14,866
Just let him sleep.

23
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,327
NO ONE WAKES HIM UP

24
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:20,789
CAN'T THINK STRAIGHT

25
00:01:20,872 --> 00:01:25,585
Why is it raining so much all of a sudden?

26
00:01:26,169 --> 00:01:29,214
THE GUESTS LOOK FOR THEIR SLEEPING SPOTS

27
00:01:29,297 --> 00:01:32,050
-Sleep wherever you want, guys.
-Okay.

28
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:37,263
THE OWNER SLEEPS IN THE CORNER

29
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:38,389
Dang it.

30
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:46,356
THE GUESTS EVACUATE
TO THE SECOND FLOOR AS WELL

31
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:50,485
SUNG-HO CLOSES THE DOOR
SO THE RAIN DOESN'T GET IN

32
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:59,536
THIS IS EXCITING

33
00:02:04,707 --> 00:02:07,794
I CAN SLEEP OUTSIDE JUST FINE

34
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:23,017
THE CALM AFTER THE STORM

35
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:34,571
THE EARLY MORNING RAIN

36
00:02:35,446 --> 00:02:38,575
STARTS TO LET UP

37
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:40,535
IT IS NOW MORNING AT KIAN'S B&B

38
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:46,249
IT RAINS

39
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:48,459
THEN IT CLEARS UP QUICKLY

40
00:02:48,543 --> 00:02:50,503
BUT IT BECOMES CLOUDY AGAIN

41
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:54,424
ULLEUNGDO ISLAND'S CAPRICIOUS WEATHER

42
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:58,177
6 A.M.

43
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:05,560
GA-HYUN AND JUN-HEE WAKE UP
TO WATCH THE SUNRISE

44
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:10,064
THEY'RE BEING CAREFUL
BECAUSE IT'S SLIPPERY

45
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:12,483
I can smell the ocean.

46
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:16,529
I wanted to film the sunrise,
but the sun's not up yet.

47
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:21,075
-Today's our last day here.
-I'm kind of sad.

48
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:22,952
I was just starting to get used to it.

49
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:26,956
WHILE THEY ENJOY THE MORNING
BEFORE CHECKOUT

50
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:30,418
THE GUESTS ARE STILL ASLEEP

51
00:03:32,086 --> 00:03:35,465
THE OWNER, WHO EVACUATED WITH THEM

52
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:39,677
JIN, WHO SLEPT OUTSIDE UNTIL THE MORNING

53
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:46,184
WHAT ABOUT SUNG-HO,
WHO WANTED TO WATCH THE SUNRISE?

54
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:49,520
WATCHING THE SUNRISE IN THEIR DREAMS

55
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:50,605
Is Sung-ho snoring?

56
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:55,068
6:30 A.M.
YE-EUN WAKES UP

57
00:03:57,028 --> 00:03:58,154
BOWS

58
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:00,698
BOW

59
00:04:01,824 --> 00:04:03,284
It's raining, isn't it?

60
00:04:04,994 --> 00:04:08,289
-Didn't your butt get wet?
-A little bit.

61
00:04:09,874 --> 00:04:12,418
-Is it slippery?
-It is.

62
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:17,757
IT'S SLIPPERY

63
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:21,261
JIN WAKES UP

64
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:30,728
HE TIDIES UP HIS BLANKET FIRST

65
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:34,232
AND GOES TO WASH UP

66
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:45,910
I'LL CRAWL OVER THERE

67
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:50,665
It's too early for this.

68
00:04:50,748 --> 00:04:54,419
KIAN'S B&B MAKES YOU WORK OUT
FROM EARLY IN THE MORNING

69
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:02,051
THE OWNER IS STILL ASLEEP IN THE CORNER

70
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:04,178
Good morning.

71
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:06,014
-Good morning.
-Weren't you cold?

72
00:05:06,097 --> 00:05:10,226
I tossed and turned a little,
but it was nice and cool.

73
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:13,146
Where did my slippers go?

74
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:20,778
-Are these yours? It says "Kian."
-I brought my military slippers.

75
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:22,989
Did someone steal them?

76
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:30,330
-Are they the ones with small holes?
-Yes, they are.

77
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:33,207
She just took them,
saying she was borrowing them.

78
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:34,709
-Who did?
-Ye-eun.

79
00:05:37,086 --> 00:05:39,297
-Who?
-Ji Ye-eun.

80
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:45,303
YE-EUN IS TAKING OUT THE TRASH

81
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:46,971
There she is.

82
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:48,931
-Where?
-Over there.

83
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:53,686
-Why are you wearing my--
-Are these yours? I'm sorry.

84
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,938
BUSTED

85
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:57,065
I didn't know.

86
00:05:57,857 --> 00:06:00,026
-I've been looking everywhere for them!
-My bad.

87
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:03,821
They were just lying there.

88
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:06,032
-Lying where?
-Over there.

89
00:06:06,115 --> 00:06:09,786
-I intentionally took them off there.
-I'm sorry, so don't be petty!

90
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:11,788
There's no such thing
as yours or mine here.

91
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:14,707
Of course there is.
What are you talking about?

92
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:17,293
OKAY, I'M COMING

93
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:20,755
Thank you.

94
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:31,641
HE'S OFF TO WASH UP

95
00:06:33,267 --> 00:06:36,104
SEONG-EUN, WHO SLEPT OUTSIDE
THROUGH THE NIGHT, WAKES UP

96
00:06:37,271 --> 00:06:39,607
Is the first person to go
leaving at 9 a.m.?

97
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:41,651
YE-EUN SETS THE MORNING BOAT SCHEDULE

98
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:44,654
I'm going to leave at 10 a.m.
and get coffee before I go.

99
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:46,531
We want to leave as early as we can.

100
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:48,449
Then how's 9:30 a.m.?

101
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:49,951
BOAT DEPARTS AT 9:30 A.M.

102
00:06:50,034 --> 00:06:51,536
-Got it.
-Okay.

103
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:56,290
MEANWHILE, JIN FINISHES WASHING UP

104
00:06:56,374 --> 00:07:00,211
AND ZONES OUT

105
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:04,257
THE OWNER WAKES UP TOO

106
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:08,469
-Did you sleep well?
-It was all right.

107
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:11,389
Except for when I woke up
because of the rain.

108
00:07:12,431 --> 00:07:15,726
I think we can go far today
once the storm passes.

109
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,979
THINKING ABOUT THE STORM
AS SOON AS HE WAKES UP

110
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:27,947
HEAVE-HO

111
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:32,827
I can't watch because I feel so bad.

112
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:44,714
Tell her she can't do that.
She has to climb up the wall.

113
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:47,258
I already feel bad
for making her go up the slide.

114
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:50,261
This is tiring.

115
00:07:51,762 --> 00:07:54,515
How can she climb up
while holding her stuff?

116
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:56,934
THE OWNER FEELS BAD

117
00:07:57,602 --> 00:08:02,023
Because of the rain,
when I was going down the slide…

118
00:08:02,106 --> 00:08:04,859
-You go down fast, right?
-It was so freaking fast.

119
00:08:04,942 --> 00:08:07,820
-You could dive into the water.
-Seriously.

120
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:08,988
-I think we should…
-Yeah.

121
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:12,241
-Put something at the end.
-Yeah.

122
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:14,452
TO-DO LIST
PUT A MAT AT THE END OF THE SLIDE

123
00:08:14,535 --> 00:08:17,205
-How many people are checking out?
-Two.

124
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:19,582
JUN-HEE AND GA-HYUN ARE CHECKING OUT TODAY

125
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:21,042
Let's take down their bags.

126
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:27,131
-Here we go.
-Okay.

127
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:29,967
That was easy.

128
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:33,596
It's heavy.

129
00:08:35,723 --> 00:08:39,185
Those who want to leave at 9:30 a.m.
should come down.

130
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:45,149
THE GUESTS WHO ARE GOING OUT
ALSO HEAD TO THE BOAT

131
00:08:53,824 --> 00:08:55,409
Goodbye.

132
00:08:57,161 --> 00:08:59,372
Will I see you again?

133
00:09:01,123 --> 00:09:02,959
I wish you all the best.

134
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:05,211
-Take care.
-You too.

135
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:06,587
I'll see you on TV.

136
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:09,507
I won't forget you.

137
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:11,676
You were our first guests.

138
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:17,014
The guests keep growing on me.

139
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,685
Bye.

140
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:23,980
-Take care.
-We'll meet again.

141
00:09:24,772 --> 00:09:26,148
-Are you sad?
-Yes.

142
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:27,942
-Really?
-I'm sad.

143
00:09:28,025 --> 00:09:29,735
Let's take a photo together.

144
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:38,744
I got attached
even though it was only one night.

145
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:40,621
Let's come back next time.

146
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:43,082
Did you learn about yourself?

147
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:46,669
It was more fun to travel alone
than I expected.

148
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:48,754
I feel more independent now.

149
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:50,590
-You gained courage.
-Yes.

150
00:09:52,341 --> 00:09:55,303
I learned more about my personality.

151
00:09:55,386 --> 00:10:00,433
I think once youth is gone,
it's gone forever.

152
00:10:01,058 --> 00:10:03,352
It was very inspirational.

153
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:07,148
I should film this.

154
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:08,399
I'll treasure it.

155
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:11,902
I think "inspirational" is the best word.

156
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:16,532
Meeting new people
was inspirational in and of itself.

157
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:20,244
I think that's what youth is all about.

158
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:23,831
Have a good life, guys.

159
00:10:24,832 --> 00:10:26,250
-I had fun.
-Me too.

160
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:28,794
-What was fun?
-The time we spent here.

161
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:30,796
Drive in reverse,
or you'll fall into the water.

162
00:10:31,922 --> 00:10:34,800
-Bye, Jun-hee and Ga-hyun.
-See you, Jun-hee and Ga-hyun.

163
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:37,470
Have a happy life. Good luck in your life.

164
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:39,055
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

165
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:42,016
KIM GA-HYUN, KIM JUN-HEE

166
00:10:42,099 --> 00:10:45,186
CHECKED OUT

167
00:10:45,853 --> 00:10:48,397
THE REST OF THE GUESTS GO EXPLORING

168
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:51,734
THE KAIST TEAM IS WITH AH-JIN

169
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:54,528
THE CLIMBING TEAM GOES SEPARATELY

170
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:59,533
Let's sit over there and talk.

171
00:11:00,117 --> 00:11:03,537
First of all,
what should we make for dinner tonight?

172
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:04,914
Should we make curry?

173
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:06,999
DISCUSSION TOPIC
DINNER MENU

174
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,834
-But for the curry…
-Yes?

175
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:11,212
Let's not buy
any supplementary ingredients.

176
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:16,092
Let's just get instant curry.

177
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:18,052
-Sounds good. Those are delicious.
-Right?

178
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:21,013
Let's eat with our hands tonight.

179
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:22,890
WITH OUR HANDS?

180
00:11:22,973 --> 00:11:24,308
Eat curry with our hands?

181
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:25,810
EXPERIENCE TRADITIONAL INDIAN WAYS

182
00:11:25,893 --> 00:11:26,894
But it'll be hot.

183
00:11:27,478 --> 00:11:28,396
It's Indian food.

184
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:32,483
-But we're getting instant--
-Even that is Indian food here.

185
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:34,318
Isn't instant curry Korean?

186
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:37,154
-What about the staff?
-We'll use our hands too.

187
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:38,864
Do you even have to ask?

188
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:45,746
We have spoons, but we won't use them?

189
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:48,666
-That's required for Indian food.
-Are you sure?

190
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:51,293
It feels like I'm breaking a taboo.

191
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:52,837
It feels strange.

192
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,630
STRANGE FEELING

193
00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:59,051
You're not just eating food.
You're interacting with it.

194
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:01,971
It will be a special experience.

195
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:04,348
Like we're in India.

196
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:05,766
Right.

197
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:06,767
RELUCTANTLY AGREES

198
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:09,311
We might get more guests,
so maybe 15 portions?

199
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:10,813
-Fifteen?
-Yes, exactly.

200
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:13,607
TONIGHT'S DINNER: INSTANT CURRY
EAT WITH YOUR HANDS

201
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:16,402
-Oh, and one more thing.
-What?

202
00:12:16,485 --> 00:12:18,362
We need more interaction with the guests.

203
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:21,407
Stop looking after yourselves
and connect with our guests.

204
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:22,616
I have been doing that.

205
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:23,659
Good job.

206
00:12:23,742 --> 00:12:25,035
I also communicated with them.

207
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:26,412
Hold on.

208
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:29,623
Hello?

209
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:31,375
-Hello.
-Hello.

210
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:33,169
I'll be checking in today…

211
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:35,171
A CALL FROM A NEW GUEST

212
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:36,797
How big is your group?

213
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:38,549
-There are three of us.
-Three people.

214
00:12:38,632 --> 00:12:41,510
THREE PEOPLE?

215
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:42,428
Okay.

216
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:44,722
One adult and two elementary school kids.

217
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:46,891
-Elementary school kids.
-I'll message you now.

218
00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:48,851
-He said two kids.
-Seriously?

219
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:50,436
KIDS?

220
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:52,938
One adult and two elementary school kids.

221
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:54,523
Okay, got it.

222
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:56,400
-Sir…
-What time are they arriving?

223
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:57,359
CHAOS

224
00:12:57,443 --> 00:13:00,321
We're at Hyeonpo Port.

225
00:13:00,404 --> 00:13:02,823
Ask if they're checking in right now.

226
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:03,741
INPUT

227
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:06,243
Are you going to check in right now?

228
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:07,203
OUTPUT

229
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:11,290
-It'll take us 40 minutes to get there.
-I see. Then…

230
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:13,459
-What time do we leave?
-At 7 p.m.

231
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:15,127
That doesn't apply to us.

232
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:17,213
CHAOS ONCE AGAIN

233
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:22,885
THE CHAOS CAN BE HEARD OVER THE PHONE

234
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:24,136
They sound very confused.

235
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:26,347
Will we make it there?

236
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:31,393
-Can you get here by 3 p.m.?
-Yes.

237
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:33,103
THEY WILL PICK THEM UP AT 3 P.M.

238
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:34,897
He has a very kind voice.

239
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,482
Then…

240
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:38,150
I'll head back to the B&B first.

241
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:42,321
Can you go buy us some bowls?
Like about ten of them.

242
00:13:42,404 --> 00:13:45,824
KIAN WILL LOOK AFTER THE B&B
JIN AND YE-EUN WILL GO GROCERY SHOPPING

243
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:47,493
Let's go. See you later.

244
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:50,079
-See you later.
-Good luck, Boss.

245
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:51,997
-What's the name of the store?
-Dapara.

246
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:58,379
I hope the weather's good
so we can open the pool.

247
00:13:59,296 --> 00:14:00,631
-The pool?
-Yes.

248
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:04,134
MEANWHILE, THE OWNER IS ALONE AT THE PORT

249
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:08,389
Will this run today?

250
00:14:08,472 --> 00:14:10,349
A MYSTERIOUS OBJECT

251
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:13,561
You go down the slide here
and fall into the ocean.

252
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:16,939
A SLIDE THAT GOES STRAIGHT INTO THE OCEAN

253
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:19,275
This is truly an all-natural outdoor pool.

254
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:21,151
THEY CAN SWIM IN THE OCEAN

255
00:14:21,735 --> 00:14:24,238
ADD A FENCE FOR SAFETY IN THE OCEAN

256
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:27,408
LIKE THIS

257
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:32,788
WATERSLIDE AND POOL OPENING SOON

258
00:14:33,497 --> 00:14:35,708
KIAN'S B&B POOL DEPARTS

259
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:03,819
SAFETY CHECK

260
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:10,784
PICKING UP TRASH

261
00:15:11,827 --> 00:15:13,078
Do I unwind this?

262
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:16,540
TIDYING UP THE ROPES

263
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:17,917
Let me help.

264
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:22,254
CONNECTING TO THE BOAT

265
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:26,592
POOL INSTALLATION COMPLETE

266
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:31,221
I'm home.

267
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:34,308
MY HOME

268
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:39,730
HOW TO GET INSIDE MY HOME

269
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:44,652
Why do I need to use the bathroom now?

270
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:45,945
I just got up here!

271
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:48,030
HOW TO GO TO THE BATHROOM

272
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:50,658
Why do I have to go once I get up there?

273
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:57,164
I should clean up the bathroom first.

274
00:15:57,247 --> 00:15:58,499
I need a basin.

275
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:13,097
WASHES HIS FACE WHILE HE'S AT IT

276
00:16:31,615 --> 00:16:33,242
Shoot, this is too heavy.

277
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:54,304
Dang it.

278
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:03,480
FINALLY ARRIVED

279
00:17:17,786 --> 00:17:20,080
A PIECE OF TOILET PAPER ESCAPES

280
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:36,513
GRITS TEETH

281
00:17:48,108 --> 00:17:50,652
Is this a fresh roll? Who did this…

282
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:52,654
THE TOILET PAPER SNAPS

283
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:55,324
IT LANDS ON THE BOAT NEXT DOOR

284
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:57,659
I hope it's clean. I should be careful.

285
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:12,883
I can't believe it.

286
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:17,471
ABSOLUTE CHAOS

287
00:18:18,722 --> 00:18:22,267
I shouldn't give them too much food.

288
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:24,978
I should give them less food.

289
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:27,481
Which dish gives you constipation?

290
00:18:29,316 --> 00:18:32,152
STARTS CLEANING WITH WATER

291
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:44,248
WIPES WITH HIS FOOT

292
00:18:50,754 --> 00:18:51,922
It must be dirt, right?

293
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:55,259
LIKE THE WATER BEING SPILLED

294
00:18:55,342 --> 00:18:58,762
THE SKY WAS CLEAR FOR A MOMENT

295
00:18:59,888 --> 00:19:02,599
THEN RAIN POURS DOWN

296
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:10,274
CLEANING IN THE RAIN

297
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:14,528
MOVES ON TO THE NEXT STALL

298
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:28,417
SEALED

299
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,960
I've lost my appetite.

300
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:42,472
WIPES WITH HIS FOOT AGAIN

301
00:19:47,936 --> 00:19:50,314
WASHES HIS HANDS ONLY

302
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:59,656
THE LAST STEP

303
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:13,212
THE OWNER IS USING THE BATHROOM

304
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:19,384
THE INCREASINGLY HEAVY RAIN

305
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:22,846
IS BAD NEWS FOR THE CLIMBING TEAM

306
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:25,182
-Goodness.
-Damn it.

307
00:20:25,265 --> 00:20:27,017
The weather is not on our side.

308
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:29,478
I think we should wipe it
with our clothes.

309
00:20:30,771 --> 00:20:33,398
WET ROCKS ARE DANGEROUS

310
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:36,068
It's not working.
I can't wipe the water off.

311
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:41,323
-It's raining again.
-Right.

312
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:44,326
-I think we should just give up.
-Let's head back.

313
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:47,079
Nothing is easy.

314
00:20:47,162 --> 00:20:49,039
THE CLIMBING TEAM HEADS BACK

315
00:20:49,122 --> 00:20:52,668
THE OWNER IS BACK HOME

316
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:58,548
HE WIPES HIS LEGS AND FEET

317
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:14,147
MEAL TRAY

318
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:16,191
CHOPSTICKS

319
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:20,028
POT?

320
00:21:20,737 --> 00:21:22,364
Let's see.

321
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:25,033
Sung-ho.

322
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:32,416
TWO HOURS AGO

323
00:21:32,499 --> 00:21:37,504
There's no souvenir
for our guests to take back home.

324
00:21:37,587 --> 00:21:39,506
Let's get some bowls or meal trays.

325
00:21:39,589 --> 00:21:43,802
I'll write their names on it with a hammer
and give it to them as a gift.

326
00:21:43,885 --> 00:21:44,970
Good idea.

327
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:48,432
MAKING KIAN'S B&B SOUVENIRS

328
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:03,697
ONLY MANAGED TO COMPLETE ONE LETTER

329
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,492
This is harder than I thought.

330
00:22:09,244 --> 00:22:10,203
Sung-ho.

331
00:22:10,287 --> 00:22:12,372
THINKS HARD

332
00:22:16,376 --> 00:22:18,462
PICKS THE SCISSORS

333
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:21,256
USES THE SCISSORS

334
00:22:22,215 --> 00:22:26,094
USES THE POT AS A HAMMER AGAIN

335
00:22:30,098 --> 00:22:33,060
THERE'S NOT MUCH DIFFERENCE

336
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:37,731
GIVES UP

337
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:41,359
TAKES OUT A DRILL

338
00:22:50,827 --> 00:22:51,703
Good.

339
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:53,789
SATISFIED

340
00:23:00,253 --> 00:23:03,256
FOCUSED

341
00:23:07,302 --> 00:23:11,139
HE'S BEEN WORKING ON IT FOR AN HOUR

342
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:13,809
KIAN'S B&B, TAE-IN

343
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:17,104
SOUVENIR COMPLETE

344
00:23:17,979 --> 00:23:24,528
DON'T FORGET THE CLEANING SERVICE

345
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:28,198
I'm exhausted.

346
00:23:29,157 --> 00:23:32,744
PASSES OUT IMMEDIATELY

347
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:34,204
KIAN'S B&B, TAE-IN

348
00:23:34,287 --> 00:23:36,289
KIAN'S B&B, MU-HONG

349
00:23:37,124 --> 00:23:38,834
KIAN'S B&B, KI-HONG

350
00:23:42,796 --> 00:23:46,091
THE SKY CLEARS UP AGAIN

351
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:48,468
JIN AND YE-EUN RETURN

352
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:49,970
Well done.

353
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:55,183
LOTS OF GROCERIES

354
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:57,727
-We should call out for the guests.
-Dear guests!

355
00:23:57,811 --> 00:23:59,062
READY TO PICK UP THE NEW GUESTS

356
00:23:59,146 --> 00:24:02,023
-Are the 3 p.m. guests here?
-Sir!

357
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:04,067
-Are they in that car?
-Maybe.

358
00:24:04,151 --> 00:24:06,236
THE NEW GUESTS HAVE ARRIVED

359
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:08,530
I wouldn't have "guessed" they were them.

360
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:12,200
What's wrong with you?

361
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:14,703
KEEPING HER DISTANCE

362
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:17,372
-Can't you just laugh at it?
-How can I?

363
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:21,042
-Hello.
-Hello.

364
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:22,294
Here come the kids.

365
00:24:22,377 --> 00:24:25,422
-Hello.
-Welcome.

366
00:24:25,505 --> 00:24:28,049
-Isn't Kian…
-We're employees of Kian's B&B.

367
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:28,967
Oh, I see.

368
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:31,428
-How old are you?
-I'm 13 years old.

369
00:24:31,511 --> 00:24:32,637
-Are you really?
-Yes.

370
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:33,638
You're quite tall.

371
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:36,600
-Where should I put these?
-I'll take them.

372
00:24:38,226 --> 00:24:41,563
-Do we take the…
-Yes, we have to take the boat there.

373
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:43,190
WE HAVE TO TAKE THE BOAT

374
00:24:43,773 --> 00:24:44,608
OMINOUS

375
00:24:44,691 --> 00:24:46,193
That's how we get there.

376
00:24:46,276 --> 00:24:47,903
You have to wear them.

377
00:24:49,696 --> 00:24:51,448
CONFUSED

378
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:54,659
SLOPPY

379
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:58,830
-Can you come over here?
-Yes?

380
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:01,791
You can't wear a life jacket like that.

381
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:03,752
-Put your right arm.
-Okay.

382
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:06,046
Now, your left arm.

383
00:25:08,465 --> 00:25:09,633
Thank you.

384
00:25:11,593 --> 00:25:12,552
It's okay, guys.

385
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:14,179
BOARDING THE BOAT

386
00:25:16,264 --> 00:25:18,600
-Are you driving?
-Yes.

387
00:25:19,226 --> 00:25:21,353
-Is this okay?
-She got her license for the show.

388
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:23,563
CONFUSED

389
00:25:23,647 --> 00:25:25,607
TRUST ME

390
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:27,025
We'll go slowly.

391
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:39,329
-What in the world? Is that the B&B?
-What?

392
00:25:39,829 --> 00:25:40,789
Is that it?

393
00:25:41,414 --> 00:25:42,374
It must be.

394
00:25:43,291 --> 00:25:44,292
What the heck?

395
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:45,961
Are they serious?

396
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:47,879
BAFFLED

397
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:49,089
Really?

398
00:25:49,589 --> 00:25:52,467
It looks like a playground.

399
00:25:54,261 --> 00:25:57,180
I was wondering,
"Is this really where we're sleeping?"

400
00:25:57,264 --> 00:25:58,848
I was really surprised.

401
00:25:58,932 --> 00:26:01,059
This isn't a house. It's a playground.

402
00:26:01,142 --> 00:26:02,811
There was no entrance.

403
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:06,481
I was shocked
there was a climbing wall instead.

404
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:10,610
-I'll carry it.
-The life jacket.

405
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,530
Take my hand.

406
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:20,078
My butt is a little wet.

407
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:22,914
What could this be?

408
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:26,418
I think we need to enter
from the second floor.

409
00:26:27,294 --> 00:26:28,795
Where's the boss?

410
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:34,884
THE OWNER WAKES UP

411
00:26:37,637 --> 00:26:40,515
-Boss, the guests are here.
-Okay.

412
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:42,434
Let's go.

413
00:26:42,517 --> 00:26:46,813
Hello, my name is Jin,
and I'm the manager of Kian's B&B.

414
00:26:46,896 --> 00:26:49,733
Hello, I'm Ji Ye-eun,
a staff member of Kian's B&B.

415
00:26:49,816 --> 00:26:51,985
-Hello.
-This is the only entrance

416
00:26:52,068 --> 00:26:53,987
to the second floor where the rooms are.

417
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:58,199
-There's no door.
-You must climb up to the entrance.

418
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:01,328
Even if you can't climb up,
I'm afraid there's no other way.

419
00:27:01,411 --> 00:27:07,292
It's forbidden to go up the slide,
so please keep that in mind.

420
00:27:08,251 --> 00:27:09,961
-I'll show you an example.
-Sure.

421
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:18,678
I'll help you up when you get here.

422
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:26,978
-We got everything you asked for.
-Really? Good job.

423
00:27:31,358 --> 00:27:33,068
-Hello.
-Hello.

424
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:35,278
-Hello.
-Welcome.

425
00:27:35,362 --> 00:27:36,780
-Hi.
-Hello.

426
00:27:37,572 --> 00:27:39,491
-Nice to meet you.
-Hello.

427
00:27:39,574 --> 00:27:42,118
-So you're here with your sons.
-Yes.

428
00:27:42,702 --> 00:27:44,204
It's a pleasure to have you.

429
00:27:44,287 --> 00:27:46,706
-What's your name?
-My name is Ha Dam.

430
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:48,291
Is your first name Dam?

431
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:49,292
HA DAM, 8 YEARS OLD

432
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:50,418
What about your brother?

433
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:52,128
-His name is Ha Yul.
-I see.

434
00:27:52,212 --> 00:27:54,130
HA YUL, 13 YEARS OLD

435
00:27:54,214 --> 00:27:56,883
HA JUNG-HWAN, 45 YEARS OLD

436
00:27:56,966 --> 00:27:59,052
If you fall from here,

437
00:27:59,135 --> 00:28:01,638
-this will slow you down.
-Okay.

438
00:28:01,721 --> 00:28:03,848
-The bathroom is outside.
-Okay.

439
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:08,019
You have to think before you go outside.
You can't easily go in and out.

440
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:11,439
You have to think carefully
about why you have to go outside.

441
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:12,524
Okay.

442
00:28:12,607 --> 00:28:14,150
YUL GIVES IT A GO

443
00:28:14,234 --> 00:28:15,610
You're going up already?

444
00:28:16,444 --> 00:28:17,445
Be careful.

445
00:28:18,113 --> 00:28:19,114
You've got this.

446
00:28:24,285 --> 00:28:26,079
Oh, you're doing great.

447
00:28:26,162 --> 00:28:27,372
-Good.
-Take my hand.

448
00:28:28,998 --> 00:28:30,458
You can do it.

449
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:34,546
Take your time.

450
00:28:36,005 --> 00:28:36,840
Good.

451
00:28:36,923 --> 00:28:38,341
-Wasn't that fun?
-It was.

452
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:41,678
-You have to do this each time.
-Okay.

453
00:28:41,761 --> 00:28:44,848
"Creative" is the best way to describe it.

454
00:28:44,931 --> 00:28:46,808
I'll help you. Go to the left.

455
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:47,892
DAM GIVES IT A GO

456
00:28:52,647 --> 00:28:55,400
This is really impressive.

457
00:28:55,483 --> 00:28:57,736
You'll get here in just one more step.

458
00:28:57,819 --> 00:28:59,237
Be careful.

459
00:28:59,946 --> 00:29:02,365
-He's holding that to go up?
-He's doing great.

460
00:29:02,449 --> 00:29:04,284
Grab the blue one on your right.

461
00:29:04,367 --> 00:29:06,619
-The blue one!
-Get a good grip on it.

462
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:09,998
-The yellow one.
-You're doing great.

463
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:11,666
There you go!

464
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,251
You did a great job.

465
00:29:13,334 --> 00:29:15,420
-That was so cool.
-Good job.

466
00:29:15,503 --> 00:29:16,963
Doesn't it feel great?

467
00:29:19,924 --> 00:29:21,426
-Can you try it?
-Me?

468
00:29:21,509 --> 00:29:24,929
THE OWNER GIVES A DEMONSTRATION

469
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:27,557
He makes it look so easy.

470
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,187
It's your turn, sir.

471
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:33,605
I'll give it a go.

472
00:29:33,688 --> 00:29:35,482
DAD GIVES IT A GO

473
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:46,910
-You're doing great.
-You're good at this.

474
00:29:51,539 --> 00:29:52,791
You've got this.

475
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:54,542
-Are you tired?
-Yes.

476
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:57,378
You guys can use the slide
to come up here then.

477
00:29:57,462 --> 00:29:59,672
Since you're still kids.

478
00:29:59,756 --> 00:30:01,049
ONLY YUL AND DAM ARE ALLOWED

479
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,676
Do you want to try the water "slice"?

480
00:30:04,427 --> 00:30:06,638
We just opened it.

481
00:30:06,721 --> 00:30:08,348
GRAND OPENING OF THE WATER SLICE

482
00:30:08,431 --> 00:30:12,060
-Let me check if it works.
-Sure.

483
00:30:16,731 --> 00:30:18,900
TURNS ON THE MOTOR FOR WATER TO COME OUT

484
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:21,069
It's a slide.

485
00:30:22,028 --> 00:30:23,071
There's water now.

486
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:24,823
THE OWNER SHOWS A DEMONSTRATION

487
00:30:25,573 --> 00:30:26,533
Shall we go?

488
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:37,126
SUPER INTERESTED

489
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:38,461
That's amazing!

490
00:30:39,045 --> 00:30:39,879
How is it?

491
00:30:39,963 --> 00:30:41,339
It's scary.

492
00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:43,049
It's scary.

493
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:45,885
That looks really refreshing.

494
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:54,519
That was fun.

495
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:56,896
Should we go in?

496
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:58,189
Dad wants to try, Yul.

497
00:30:58,773 --> 00:31:00,775
I'LL DO IT IF DAD DOES

498
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:03,862
That looks fun.

499
00:31:10,618 --> 00:31:13,454
THIS IS EXCITING

500
00:31:18,209 --> 00:31:19,335
It's so refreshing.

501
00:31:21,671 --> 00:31:22,839
NERVOUS

502
00:31:23,423 --> 00:31:25,008
-Can I go right away?
-Yes.

503
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:27,635
Go.

504
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:33,600
Dam!

505
00:31:34,183 --> 00:31:35,143
Hold your nose.

506
00:31:35,226 --> 00:31:37,312
Close it tight. I'll be right here.

507
00:31:48,656 --> 00:31:50,992
-That was fun.
-It's so refreshing.

508
00:31:55,788 --> 00:31:58,499
I never imagined this would be the B&B.

509
00:31:59,667 --> 00:32:02,086
I couldn't believe that was real.

510
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:04,797
It's a playground.

511
00:32:08,134 --> 00:32:10,762
I think I'll remember this forever.

512
00:32:13,681 --> 00:32:18,519
I was confused when I first saw it
and thought it looked bizarre.

513
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:20,396
But on the other hand,

514
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:23,983
I thought it could be a huge castle
or a playground for the kids.

515
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:26,486
WHAT ARE THE OTHER GUESTS DOING?

516
00:32:26,569 --> 00:32:29,280
AH-JIN
SEONG-EUN, SUNG-HO, KI-HONG

517
00:32:35,536 --> 00:32:37,664
NARI BASIN

518
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:41,709
-This really is a wild forest.
-Right?

519
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:45,213
THE KAIST TEAM
IS DOING ECOLOGY CLUB ACTIVITIES

520
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:48,216
Ulleungdo Island
has never been connected to the mainland.

521
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:51,010
So there are
a lot of rare species of plants.

522
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:53,221
I came to look
at all the fascinating plants here.

523
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:54,973
ULLEUNGDO ISLAND ECOLOGICAL EXPLORATION

526
00:33:02,522 --> 00:33:04,232
-See the white flowers?
-Oh, I see.

527
00:33:04,774 --> 00:33:07,235
Also, this tree is called Ulleungdo maple.

528
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:10,154
ULLEUNGDO ISLAND NATIVE PLANT 2
ULLEUNGDO MAPLE

529
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:12,198
Ulleungdo maple leaves
have 10 to 12 veins,

530
00:33:12,281 --> 00:33:13,658
unlike the usual maple leaves.

531
00:33:16,285 --> 00:33:17,620
Let me get closer.

532
00:33:17,704 --> 00:33:19,789
-I see ants.
-What kind of ants?

533
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:21,124
They're Smith ants.

534
00:33:21,207 --> 00:33:23,543

536
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:32,427
Did you find something?

537
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:34,512
-I hear something.
-Is it a bird?

538
00:33:34,595 --> 00:33:35,430
It sounds close by.

539
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:38,349
FOUND A BIRD

540
00:33:41,811 --> 00:33:45,148
SPECIES OF CONSERVATION INTEREST
WHITE-BELLIED THRUSH

541
00:33:45,231 --> 00:33:46,941
What kind of bird is it?

542
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:49,152
SPECIES OF CONSERVATION INTEREST
CHICKADEE

543
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:53,448
There's a chipmunk over there.

544
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:56,200
It's really a chipmunk.

545
00:33:56,826 --> 00:33:58,161
BAND-WINGED GRASSHOPPER

546
00:33:58,244 --> 00:33:59,203
LELIA DECEMPUNCTATA

547
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:01,914
-I'm so happy.
-We're done here.

548
00:34:01,998 --> 00:34:04,834
ARCHITECTURE STUDENT AH-JIN'S JOURNEY

549
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:09,088
I'm so excited.

550
00:34:09,172 --> 00:34:10,506
EXPLORING THE ARCHITECTURE

551
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:11,758
This is incredible.

552
00:34:18,681 --> 00:34:20,433
My heart's pounding right now.

553
00:34:28,983 --> 00:34:30,109
4:00 P.M.

554
00:34:30,193 --> 00:34:31,778
We should start cooking.

555
00:34:31,861 --> 00:34:34,822
KIAN'S B&B CHEF IS ON THE MOVE

556
00:34:35,364 --> 00:34:37,784
-I wrote the names.
-What?

557
00:34:37,867 --> 00:34:39,202
-You wrote them all?
-Yes.

558
00:34:39,285 --> 00:34:41,954
Take a look. It's like this.

559
00:34:43,873 --> 00:34:47,043
THE OWNER'S PHONE RINGS

560
00:34:47,126 --> 00:34:50,379
COULD IT BE MORE GUESTS?

561
00:34:50,463 --> 00:34:53,966
-Hello?
-Hello, this is…

562
00:34:54,967 --> 00:34:56,969
NERVOUS

563
00:34:57,053 --> 00:35:00,264
-This is Min-seob from the climbing team.
-Oh, hello.

564
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:03,309
THE CLIMBING TEAM
IS FORCED TO TAKE A BREAK

565
00:35:03,392 --> 00:35:06,687
-We had to stop because of the rain.
-I see.

566
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:10,233
If we return sooner than planned,
we could adjust the wall.

567
00:35:10,316 --> 00:35:13,069
-Yes, I think that'd be great.
-Right.

568
00:35:13,152 --> 00:35:16,239
-We have children guests as well.
-Oh, really?

569
00:35:16,322 --> 00:35:18,199
THE CLIMBING TEAM
WILL ADJUST THE CLIMBING WALL

570
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:20,618
-Got it. See you then.
-Thank you.

571
00:35:22,078 --> 00:35:23,287
I need to go back up.

572
00:35:25,915 --> 00:35:28,000
Ye-eun, the climbing team
wants to come back.

573
00:35:28,084 --> 00:35:29,293
-Can you pick them up?
-Okay.

574
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:33,005
CAPTAIN JI GOES TO PICK THEM UP

575
00:35:37,218 --> 00:35:40,471
JIN PREPARES DINNER

576
00:35:41,305 --> 00:35:42,765
DINNER MENU
INSTANT CURRY

577
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:44,517
-Boss!
-Yes?

578
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,352
-Before you come down…
-Yes?

579
00:35:46,435 --> 00:35:49,355
-Can you look for the MSG and sugar?
-MSG and sugar?

580
00:35:49,438 --> 00:35:50,773
They must be outside.

581
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:02,910
AN UNEXPECTED ACCIDENT

582
00:36:21,053 --> 00:36:23,973
THE LIFEGUARDS ON THE SCENE
HAVE COME TO THE RESCUE

583
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:28,311
Are you okay?

584
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:30,771
Are you hurt, Boss?

585
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:32,231
Did you hurt yourself?

586
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:35,443
-I'm okay.
-Where does it hurt?

587
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:39,530
We should administer first aid
and head to a medical center.

588
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:42,283
We should go
to a public health center close by.

589
00:36:43,951 --> 00:36:46,329
HE MUST VISIT A HOSPITAL

590
00:36:46,412 --> 00:36:48,331
I think it rained that day.

591
00:36:49,957 --> 00:36:52,168
There was a storm passing by.

592
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:54,962
RAIN WAS COMING AND GOING

593
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:58,049
THE SLIDE WAS SLIPPERY BECAUSE OF THE RAIN

594
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,055
-Hello.
-Hey there.

595
00:37:04,138 --> 00:37:06,933
THE CLIMBING TEAM RETURNS

596
00:37:08,392 --> 00:37:09,393
What's going on?

597
00:37:11,938 --> 00:37:13,731
-It was the slide.
-Oh no.

598
00:37:13,814 --> 00:37:14,899
I ran into the fence.

599
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:17,360
-Oh, gosh.
-That looks pretty bad.

600
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:21,239
-What happened?
-He got hurt from the slide.

601
00:37:21,322 --> 00:37:24,033
-Oh no.
-Thank goodness it was me.

602
00:37:24,116 --> 00:37:25,493
Are you okay, though?

603
00:37:25,993 --> 00:37:28,913
-Are you going to the hospital?
-It got slippery from the rain.

604
00:37:28,996 --> 00:37:32,124
I scratched my leg on the fence.

605
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:35,336
-I think we need to fix this.
-I agree.

606
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:36,879
MORE WORRIED ABOUT HIS B&B

607
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:39,382
-I'm heading to the hospital.
-Yes, go ahead.

608
00:37:39,465 --> 00:37:41,968
-We'll get it fixed before you return.
-Thank you.

609
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:47,306
THE OWNER HAS TO LEAVE FOR A MOMENT

610
00:37:48,307 --> 00:37:51,102
HEADING TO THE HOSPITAL

611
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:56,565
Someone needs to help cook dinner.

612
00:37:57,233 --> 00:37:58,901
Jin can't do it alone.

613
00:37:59,568 --> 00:38:00,987
I'm worried about the staff.

614
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:09,036
ARRIVES AT THE HOSPITAL

615
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:14,458
But the biggest relief is that it was me.

616
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:17,628
I would've been devastated
if a guest got hurt.

617
00:38:20,172 --> 00:38:21,299
Good thing it was me.

618
00:38:21,882 --> 00:38:23,509
KIAN'S BIGGEST CONCERN NOW

619
00:38:23,592 --> 00:38:27,138
We promised them food, cleaning,
laundry, and necessities.

620
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:29,432
HIS GUESTS AT KIAN'S B&B

621
00:38:29,515 --> 00:38:32,560
I was worried
we wouldn't be able to take care of them.

622
00:38:33,769 --> 00:38:37,398
WILL KIAN'S B&B
BE ABLE TO OVERCOME THIS SITUATION?

623
00:38:38,024 --> 00:38:39,483
It's okay. We can do this.

624
00:38:40,234 --> 00:38:41,152
DON'T WORRY, BOSS

625
00:38:41,235 --> 00:38:42,903
WE'VE GOT THIS

626
00:38:46,365 --> 00:38:48,951
STAFF 1 IN CHARGE OF COOKING
JIN

627
00:38:49,827 --> 00:38:52,288
BORED

628
00:38:52,371 --> 00:38:54,540
-Dam, do you want to play a game?
-Sure.

629
00:38:54,623 --> 00:38:55,541
Really?

630
00:38:57,668 --> 00:38:58,711
That's two.

631
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:03,507
STAFF 2 IN CHARGE OF THE GUESTS
YE-EUN

632
00:39:05,801 --> 00:39:08,429
PART-TIMERS IN CHARGE OF SAFETY

633
00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:09,889
Let's plan this out.

634
00:39:09,972 --> 00:39:11,140
DISCUSSING THE DESIGN PLAN

635
00:39:11,223 --> 00:39:14,060
If there's a hold here,
there should be another one here.

636
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:16,896
-They can just step on the plastics…
-Right.

637
00:39:16,979 --> 00:39:19,815
-and grab onto the pumpy parts.
-Exactly.

638
00:39:19,899 --> 00:39:21,776
I think we should move that red one.

639
00:39:21,859 --> 00:39:24,236
REDESIGNING PROCEEDS WITH MANY JARGONS

640
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,323
Just…

641
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:29,283
TESTING IT OUT

642
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:31,869
-Think of a kid using it.
-It's the children's version.

643
00:39:31,952 --> 00:39:35,831
PRETENDING TO BE A KID

644
00:39:35,915 --> 00:39:37,833
The head will only tilt this much.

645
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:40,836
Bouldering.

646
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,213
BABY STEPS

647
00:39:43,923 --> 00:39:44,924
They'll go this way.

648
00:39:45,007 --> 00:39:46,092
WHILE THEY ARE ADJUSTING IT

649
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:49,261
THE CREW DOES SAFETY INSPECTIONS

650
00:39:52,348 --> 00:39:53,641
SAFETY REINFORCEMENT

651
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:55,059
MATS IN FRONT OF THE SLIDE

652
00:39:55,142 --> 00:39:56,477
ANTI-SLIP ROPE

653
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:59,146
MATS ADDED TO THE POLE

654
00:39:59,855 --> 00:40:04,151
KIAN HAS BEEN AWAY
FROM KIAN'S B&B FOR AN HOUR

655
00:40:04,819 --> 00:40:07,321
Let's see now.

656
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:10,324
I think I have to cook rice.

657
00:40:11,117 --> 00:40:13,119
The only thing I can't cook is rice.

658
00:40:13,202 --> 00:40:14,787
I'll cook the rice then.

659
00:40:15,871 --> 00:40:18,707
Let me look up on YouTube
how to make rice in a pot.

660
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:23,379
LEARNING HOW TO COOK RICE ON YOUTUBE

661
00:40:24,171 --> 00:40:27,550
NOT MOVING A MUSCLE

662
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:29,510
That looks easy.

663
00:40:29,593 --> 00:40:33,597
I'm not sure how much rice I should make.

664
00:40:38,394 --> 00:40:41,564
JUST POURING IT IN FOR NOW

665
00:40:41,647 --> 00:40:42,481
UNSURE

666
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:43,983
I hope this is right.

667
00:40:48,696 --> 00:40:50,406
SPILLS

668
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:52,324
Oh no, my precious rice.

669
00:40:53,576 --> 00:40:56,287
BEING SUPER CAREFUL

670
00:40:57,621 --> 00:40:58,998
Water should be up to here.

671
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:00,916
I should've put more rice.

672
00:41:02,334 --> 00:41:04,503
TAKES A SPATULA

673
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:06,338
Of course, there's no rice scoop.

674
00:41:06,922 --> 00:41:09,133
Start on medium heat.

675
00:41:09,758 --> 00:41:12,803
STARTS THE FIRE

676
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:15,139
RESTLESS FEET

677
00:41:15,848 --> 00:41:19,935
STIRS NERVOUSLY

678
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:24,440
Please, now.

679
00:41:24,523 --> 00:41:26,400
20 MINUTES LATER

680
00:41:27,651 --> 00:41:29,820
There are some cooked parts.

681
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:33,491
PRETTY SUCCESSFUL

682
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:47,630
TONIGHT'S DINNER
RICE, CURRY, KIMCHI

683
00:41:47,713 --> 00:41:50,090
Come downstairs, everyone.
The climbing team too.

684
00:41:50,174 --> 00:41:52,635
-It's dinnertime.
-Is dinner ready?

685
00:41:52,718 --> 00:41:54,595
Are we having curry tonight?

686
00:41:54,678 --> 00:41:56,347
I think we are. I smelled curry.

687
00:41:57,681 --> 00:41:58,933
Dinner's ready.

688
00:41:59,016 --> 00:42:00,142
MIN-SEOB ARRIVES FIRST

689
00:42:00,226 --> 00:42:02,186
-Do you want to try?
-Please help me.

690
00:42:03,145 --> 00:42:04,104
I'll hold you here.

691
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:05,439
Here he comes.

692
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:07,191
DESCENDS WITH HELP

693
00:42:08,484 --> 00:42:10,194
DAD SLIDES DOWN ON HIS OWN

694
00:42:10,277 --> 00:42:11,111
Nice.

695
00:42:11,695 --> 00:42:13,531
HERE COMES THE YOUNGEST GUEST, DAM

696
00:42:15,282 --> 00:42:17,451
THAT WAS FUN

697
00:42:18,035 --> 00:42:19,995
PLEASED

698
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:23,707
-Ye-eun, you should eat before you go.
-I have to go by 7:10 p.m.

699
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:25,584
CAPTAIN JI HAS TO GO

700
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:29,046
I'LL BE BACK

701
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:34,510
You're all here. Please line up over here.

702
00:42:34,593 --> 00:42:35,553
Okay.

703
00:42:35,636 --> 00:42:37,263
Our first guest's name is…

704
00:42:37,346 --> 00:42:39,390
-It's Shim Min-seob.
-Shim Min-seob.

705
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:41,642
We have assigned bowls.

706
00:42:41,725 --> 00:42:43,435
ASSIGNING PERSONAL BOWLS

707
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:45,145
-Thank you.
-Wait, come this way.

708
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:46,313
HOLD ON

709
00:42:46,897 --> 00:42:48,649
Please wash your hands.

710
00:42:48,732 --> 00:42:49,692
WASH YOUR HANDS

711
00:42:49,775 --> 00:42:52,528
BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO EAT WITH YOUR HANDS

712
00:42:52,611 --> 00:42:53,988
Let's eat with our hands tonight.

713
00:42:54,613 --> 00:42:56,073
CURRY

714
00:42:56,156 --> 00:42:58,492
CURRY WITH BARE HANDS

715
00:42:58,576 --> 00:42:59,827
THE GUESTS HAVE NO IDEA

716
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:01,036
Next guest.

717
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,913
GLANCES

718
00:43:04,456 --> 00:43:09,378
WASHING THEIR HANDS UNDER WATCHFUL EYES

719
00:43:10,754 --> 00:43:12,923
ACCEPTS HIS FATE AS WELL

720
00:43:13,507 --> 00:43:16,510
WASHES THOROUGHLY

721
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:19,138
Please line up here.

722
00:43:19,722 --> 00:43:21,181
Scoop up some rice.

723
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:24,393
DISTRIBUTES THE MEAL IN A LINE

724
00:43:24,476 --> 00:43:25,936
The curry looks delicious.

725
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:29,523
-Take only what you need.
-Okay.

726
00:43:31,567 --> 00:43:34,403
LOOKS AROUND

727
00:43:34,486 --> 00:43:35,946
Where are the spoons?

728
00:43:36,655 --> 00:43:37,865
Are they in the back?

729
00:43:38,490 --> 00:43:40,284
Do we use the spoons there?

730
00:43:40,951 --> 00:43:42,161
Spoons?

731
00:43:43,871 --> 00:43:45,706
LOOKS AWAY

732
00:43:45,789 --> 00:43:47,583
WHAT'S GOING ON?

733
00:43:48,709 --> 00:43:50,961
WHY DO I GET A BAD FEELING ABOUT THIS?

734
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:52,087
It's curry.

735
00:43:54,715 --> 00:43:56,133
With our hands?

736
00:43:57,134 --> 00:43:58,636
BAFFLED

737
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:01,263
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS

738
00:44:01,347 --> 00:44:03,182
Should I bring them from here?

739
00:44:03,265 --> 00:44:04,308
No, don't bring it.

740
00:44:04,391 --> 00:44:05,559
HE ISN'T JOKING

741
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:06,727
Seriously?

742
00:44:07,728 --> 00:44:09,271
It's curry.

743
00:44:09,355 --> 00:44:10,898
Did you all wash your hands?

744
00:44:13,108 --> 00:44:15,444
So that's why we had to wash them well.

745
00:44:15,527 --> 00:44:19,114
-It's the boss's policy.
-Really?

746
00:44:19,198 --> 00:44:21,033
We're having curry,
and there are no spoons.

747
00:44:21,116 --> 00:44:22,910
THE BOSS'S POLICY
EAT WITH YOUR HANDS TONIGHT

748
00:44:23,786 --> 00:44:25,287
I hope you enjoy your meal.

749
00:44:25,371 --> 00:44:26,622
TIME TO INTERACT WITH OUR FOOD

750
00:44:26,705 --> 00:44:28,624
-Thanks for the meal.
-Bon appétit.

751
00:44:28,707 --> 00:44:29,833
DEVASTATED

752
00:44:29,917 --> 00:44:31,543
I'm at a loss too.

753
00:44:35,422 --> 00:44:37,800
FILLED WITH HESITATION

754
00:44:38,842 --> 00:44:40,719
CAREFULLY

755
00:44:41,303 --> 00:44:42,680
TAKES A BITE

756
00:44:45,391 --> 00:44:47,685
AWKWARD SMILE

757
00:44:47,768 --> 00:44:49,603
This is harder than it looks.

758
00:44:50,688 --> 00:44:52,189
Here I go.

759
00:44:52,272 --> 00:44:54,108
DAD GIVES IT A GO

760
00:44:54,233 --> 00:44:57,486
I mean, it's my hand anyway.

761
00:44:57,569 --> 00:44:58,529
This is hard.

762
00:45:00,406 --> 00:45:02,491
LICKS

763
00:45:02,574 --> 00:45:03,409
It's hot.

764
00:45:04,076 --> 00:45:06,453
DAM HESITATES FOR A MOMENT

765
00:45:08,372 --> 00:45:12,209
BUT TAKES A BITE LIKE HIS DAD

766
00:45:14,628 --> 00:45:16,755
AWKWARD SMILE

767
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:20,300
It was difficult to eat,
and it felt very unfamiliar.

768
00:45:22,094 --> 00:45:25,431
It was delicious,
but the smell got on my hands.

769
00:45:26,849 --> 00:45:28,725
Eat it like Kian would.

770
00:45:28,809 --> 00:45:30,102
This isn't so bad.

771
00:45:32,187 --> 00:45:33,188
How is it, Dam?

772
00:45:33,272 --> 00:45:35,065
-It's good.
-Right?

773
00:45:35,691 --> 00:45:36,942
I think it's good too.

774
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:39,611
I can't get used to this.

775
00:45:39,695 --> 00:45:43,532
THEY'RE ALL GETTING USED TO IT

776
00:45:46,535 --> 00:45:49,163
I'll taste each and every ingredient.

777
00:45:50,539 --> 00:45:51,832
GETTING USED TO IT

778
00:45:53,709 --> 00:45:55,461
It's not as bad as I imagined.

779
00:45:56,336 --> 00:45:57,963
We can just wash our hands.

780
00:45:58,046 --> 00:45:59,840
There are fewer things to wash now.

781
00:45:59,923 --> 00:46:02,301
EVERYONE HAS BECOME LIKE KIAN

782
00:46:02,384 --> 00:46:04,553
It felt like
I was becoming one with the food.

783
00:46:05,262 --> 00:46:06,763
I'll try it again when I go home.

784
00:46:08,765 --> 00:46:10,184
I got used to it in the end.

785
00:46:10,767 --> 00:46:12,394
I think I'll enjoy it.

786
00:46:13,770 --> 00:46:16,064
The latecomers
will also eat like this, right?

787
00:46:17,774 --> 00:46:20,319
THEY HAD BETTER

788
00:46:20,986 --> 00:46:22,863
DON'T WORRY
HERE COMES KIAN

789
00:46:22,946 --> 00:46:24,698
Jin worked hard today.

790
00:46:39,338 --> 00:46:41,215
THE OWNER RETURNS AFTER TWO HOURS

791
00:46:41,298 --> 00:46:43,133
Goodness gracious.

792
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:47,679
CHECKS THE MATS RIGHT AWAY

793
00:46:47,763 --> 00:46:48,722
Are you okay?

794
00:46:48,805 --> 00:46:50,891
-Have you been well?
-Yes.

795
00:46:50,974 --> 00:46:52,309
-How's your leg?
-How's your stay?

796
00:46:52,392 --> 00:46:53,685
It's good.

797
00:46:53,769 --> 00:46:55,562
-Who made the rice?
-I did.

798
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:57,773
You're really reliable.

799
00:46:57,856 --> 00:46:59,399
What would I do without you?

800
00:46:59,483 --> 00:47:02,152
-Thanks for saying that.
-I'm serious.

801
00:47:04,279 --> 00:47:06,740
Let's give them spoons if they want them.

802
00:47:06,823 --> 00:47:10,285
KIAN84 PULLS UP HIS SLEEVES

803
00:47:10,369 --> 00:47:12,704
EXPECTATIONS ARE HIGH

804
00:47:12,788 --> 00:47:14,373
A spoon might be needed.

805
00:47:18,961 --> 00:47:20,712
IMPRESSED

806
00:47:20,796 --> 00:47:22,422
IN AWE

807
00:47:25,842 --> 00:47:28,011
He didn't have a hint of hesitation.

808
00:47:28,595 --> 00:47:31,014
It looks like he's always eaten that way.

809
00:47:31,098 --> 00:47:33,684
-You hesitate at first.
-Yes.

810
00:47:33,767 --> 00:47:35,352
He didn't hesitate at all.

811
00:47:35,435 --> 00:47:38,313
I thought it felt
a bit weird at first too.

812
00:47:38,397 --> 00:47:42,109
It's not like this is illegal,
but it feels wrong.

813
00:47:42,192 --> 00:47:43,860
LEGAL ACTION

814
00:47:44,570 --> 00:47:47,823
It feels like
you're interacting with the food.

815
00:47:49,157 --> 00:47:51,868
INTERACTING RIGHT NOW

816
00:47:51,952 --> 00:47:54,204
NOM

817
00:47:54,288 --> 00:47:55,872
You're doing it properly.

818
00:47:55,956 --> 00:47:57,207
He's a real pro.

819
00:47:57,291 --> 00:47:59,543
I watched how he did it.

820
00:47:59,626 --> 00:48:01,753
First, he mixes it.

821
00:48:01,837 --> 00:48:03,714
BEGINNER'S VERSION

822
00:48:03,797 --> 00:48:06,967
VETERAN'S VERSION

823
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:15,601
EATS EVERY LAST GRAIN

824
00:48:18,353 --> 00:48:21,064
FINISHED EATING

825
00:48:21,148 --> 00:48:26,194
WASHING HIS OWN BOWL

826
00:48:26,278 --> 00:48:30,490
WASHING HIS OWN FACE

827
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:37,581
ANYWAY, HE'S DONE

828
00:48:37,664 --> 00:48:39,207
KAIST TEAM AND AH-JIN RETURN

829
00:48:39,291 --> 00:48:40,375
Welcome back.

830
00:48:40,459 --> 00:48:42,252
-Did you eat already?
-Yes.

831
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:45,881
-Welcome back.
-Hey.

832
00:48:45,964 --> 00:48:47,841
-Hello.
-Come down for dinner.

833
00:48:48,884 --> 00:48:50,344
We had a light meal.

834
00:48:50,427 --> 00:48:52,429
-No, you have to eat this.
-You can't miss this.

835
00:48:52,512 --> 00:48:53,680
At least have a bite.

836
00:48:53,764 --> 00:48:55,223
You can't skip a meal.

837
00:48:56,016 --> 00:48:57,768
We can't be the only ones.

838
00:48:57,851 --> 00:48:59,603
Skipping meals is not allowed.

839
00:48:59,686 --> 00:49:02,481
THESE GUYS ARE ALL LOOKING OUT FOR THEM

840
00:49:02,564 --> 00:49:04,066
This place is like the military.

841
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:09,696
-Hello.
-Hello.

842
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:11,490
Come this way.

843
00:49:11,573 --> 00:49:13,575
We have ramyeon
if this isn't enough for you.

844
00:49:14,117 --> 00:49:15,869
Please wash your hands thoroughly.

845
00:49:15,952 --> 00:49:16,995
-Sung-ho.
-Yes?

846
00:49:18,205 --> 00:49:19,998
READING THE ROOM

847
00:49:20,082 --> 00:49:22,376
Have you ever eaten with your hands?

848
00:49:22,459 --> 00:49:24,169
No, I haven't.

849
00:49:24,252 --> 00:49:26,755
-You've never experienced it abroad?
-No, never.

850
00:49:26,838 --> 00:49:28,090
Did everyone do this?

851
00:49:28,173 --> 00:49:29,216
-Yes.
-Yes.

852
00:49:29,883 --> 00:49:31,385
HESITATES

853
00:49:39,017 --> 00:49:40,435
Eating curry with our hands.

854
00:49:40,519 --> 00:49:42,604
That's when it hit me
that I was at Kian's B&B.

855
00:49:42,688 --> 00:49:47,275
When would I ever get to eat curry
with my hands again?

856
00:49:47,943 --> 00:49:49,277
It was a new experience.

857
00:49:50,278 --> 00:49:51,238
Come down.

858
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:52,864
I'll go down first.

859
00:49:54,449 --> 00:49:56,868
KI-HONG DESCENDS FIRST

860
00:49:56,952 --> 00:49:58,370
-You have to hold onto this.
-Okay.

861
00:49:58,453 --> 00:49:59,663
YE-EUN GETS HELP

862
00:49:59,746 --> 00:50:02,624
-Here I come. My palms are sweaty.
-You'll be fine.

863
00:50:02,708 --> 00:50:03,667
My hands…

864
00:50:06,753 --> 00:50:08,880
WHAT'S WRONG?

865
00:50:08,964 --> 00:50:12,509
WHAT'S GOING ON UP THERE?

866
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:17,389
POWER SHOULDERS

867
00:50:17,472 --> 00:50:18,765
She got down fine.

868
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:20,267
Her shoulders are gone.

869
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:22,686
I've seen that in horror movies.

870
00:50:23,311 --> 00:50:26,857
A CHARACTER FROM A HORROR MOVIE

871
00:50:28,734 --> 00:50:31,319
YE-EUN ALSO WASHES HER HANDS

872
00:50:31,403 --> 00:50:32,696
How do I go about this?

873
00:50:35,949 --> 00:50:37,951
You have to eat with your hands.

874
00:50:39,995 --> 00:50:40,954
This is hilarious.

875
00:50:41,037 --> 00:50:41,997
I'm not that hungry.

876
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:43,206
ONLY ONE SPOON OF RICE

877
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:45,041
SCOOPS FOR HER RIGHT AWAY

878
00:50:45,125 --> 00:50:46,418
You should eat more.

879
00:50:47,002 --> 00:50:49,588
FLOODS HER BOWL WITH CURRY

880
00:50:49,671 --> 00:50:51,631
-Take some kimchi.
-I don't want any.

881
00:50:51,715 --> 00:50:54,509
-Come on.
-I don't like kimchi.

882
00:50:59,806 --> 00:51:01,475
You have to tear the rice apart.

883
00:51:01,558 --> 00:51:04,311
ADVICE FROM THE EXPERIENCED

884
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:08,023
It's so funny.

885
00:51:09,441 --> 00:51:12,152
IT'S YOUR TURN NOW, YE-EUN

886
00:51:13,111 --> 00:51:14,112
Don't look at me.

887
00:51:15,238 --> 00:51:16,114
Don't look.

888
00:51:18,617 --> 00:51:20,660
We can't be the only ones to enjoy this.

889
00:51:20,744 --> 00:51:22,871
EVERYONE'S WATCHING

890
00:51:22,954 --> 00:51:24,247
This is…

891
00:51:24,331 --> 00:51:25,499
I can't believe this.

892
00:51:31,254 --> 00:51:33,882
MUKBANG WITH HER BACK TURNED

893
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:37,093
Why is your back turned, Ye-eun?

894
00:51:37,677 --> 00:51:39,346
I'M TOO SHY

895
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:42,307
Then just eat with a spoon.

896
00:51:43,558 --> 00:51:45,185
I'm not forcing you to do this.

897
00:51:46,269 --> 00:51:48,021
It's because I'm shy.

898
00:51:48,104 --> 00:51:49,231
You don't have to…

899
00:51:50,315 --> 00:51:51,691
You don't have to force it.

900
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:54,778
FEELS GUILTY FOR SOME REASON

901
00:51:56,822 --> 00:51:58,448
Don't force yourself, Ye-eun.

902
00:51:58,532 --> 00:51:59,908
I'm not forcing myself.

903
00:52:01,076 --> 00:52:02,410
NOM

904
00:52:02,494 --> 00:52:03,703
It's actually delicious.

905
00:52:05,539 --> 00:52:07,040
This is good, though.

906
00:52:07,874 --> 00:52:10,961
I guess you were quite hungry.
You finished it.

907
00:52:14,506 --> 00:52:17,300
HER BOWL HAS BEEN CLEARED

908
00:52:19,845 --> 00:52:21,847
-Were you hungry?
-Yes.

909
00:52:22,430 --> 00:52:24,724
-Doesn't it feel weird?
-It really does.

910
00:52:24,808 --> 00:52:26,476
-It's strange, right?
-It feels funny.

911
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:27,561
It's addictive, though.

912
00:52:27,644 --> 00:52:29,646
It's like you're intimate with food.

913
00:52:31,231 --> 00:52:32,524
FEELS INTIMATE ALREADY

914
00:52:32,607 --> 00:52:33,650
That was good.

915
00:52:35,902 --> 00:52:37,112
What's hard to eat with hands?

916
00:52:37,195 --> 00:52:39,948
CHATTING AFTER DINNER

917
00:52:40,031 --> 00:52:42,367
Kimchi stew would be hard.

918
00:52:42,951 --> 00:52:44,452
You can't eat that with your hands.

919
00:52:45,036 --> 00:52:47,998
THE OWNER WATCHES THEM FROM FAR AWAY

920
00:52:53,003 --> 00:52:55,380
HE GRABS A BEER

921
00:52:55,463 --> 00:52:58,216
AND IS ABOUT TO GO UP ALONE

922
00:53:01,553 --> 00:53:03,972
I REFUSE TO BE ORDINARY

923
00:53:18,612 --> 00:53:19,821
Heave-ho.

924
00:53:19,905 --> 00:53:21,072
ACK

925
00:53:25,118 --> 00:53:26,745
This isn't as…

926
00:53:28,997 --> 00:53:32,459
AMBITIOUSLY DESIGNED TEATIME ZONE

927
00:53:32,542 --> 00:53:35,962
I put a lot of work into this space,
but people aren't using it much.

928
00:53:49,267 --> 00:53:51,478
THE THIRD DAY OF BUSINESS
IS ESPECIALLY TOUGH

929
00:53:51,561 --> 00:53:54,773
It's been a crazy three days.
We were all too busy.

930
00:53:54,856 --> 00:53:57,442
I had to take care of everything.

931
00:53:57,525 --> 00:53:58,985
I had so much to worry about.

932
00:54:06,534 --> 00:54:07,786
-Come here.
-What?

933
00:54:09,204 --> 00:54:10,080
I'll go there.

934
00:54:11,915 --> 00:54:14,918
THE ONLY PERSON WHO LOOKS AFTER HIM
IS THE STAFF

935
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:18,421
So that's why.

936
00:54:19,464 --> 00:54:21,591
-I see why they don't use this space.
-Why?

937
00:54:21,675 --> 00:54:24,928
-It's really uncomfortable.
-Of course, it is. You didn't know?

938
00:54:25,011 --> 00:54:27,222
UNCOMFORTABLE

939
00:54:27,305 --> 00:54:28,640
I'll pour you a glass.

940
00:54:29,224 --> 00:54:30,725
This is all I have.

941
00:54:30,809 --> 00:54:32,352
-Let's make a toast.
-Okay.

942
00:54:42,445 --> 00:54:43,780
Thanks, by the way.

943
00:54:44,823 --> 00:54:46,574
When I got hurt and had to leave,

944
00:54:47,492 --> 00:54:53,289
you had to make dinner for everyone
and take care of them too.

945
00:54:54,624 --> 00:54:57,544
When I came back,
they said you were doing a great job.

946
00:54:57,627 --> 00:55:00,130
-Well, that's my job.
-Yeah?

947
00:55:00,213 --> 00:55:01,923
I'm the manager, after all.

948
00:55:02,674 --> 00:55:04,426
We're all working as a team.

949
00:55:05,427 --> 00:55:06,678
You did all the work.

950
00:55:06,761 --> 00:55:08,972
That's not true. It was all thanks to you.

951
00:55:10,724 --> 00:55:11,808
Thanks.

952
00:55:11,891 --> 00:55:14,019
-I'm having fun.
-Are you really?

953
00:55:16,896 --> 00:55:18,398
He's a top employee.

954
00:55:19,315 --> 00:55:23,278
He's great at his job
and offers a lot of support.

955
00:55:23,361 --> 00:55:25,405
That's why I'm grateful for Jin.

956
00:55:25,905 --> 00:55:29,284
He's so reliable. I'm very grateful.

957
00:55:33,455 --> 00:55:34,456
We've got this.

958
00:55:36,833 --> 00:55:39,169
CLIMBING UP THE POLE AFTER DINNER

959
00:55:40,253 --> 00:55:42,964
STRUGGLING

960
00:55:43,048 --> 00:55:44,257
ALSO STRUGGLING

961
00:55:44,340 --> 00:55:46,426
Keep pushing with your legs.

962
00:55:47,385 --> 00:55:50,638
ALSO STRUGGLING UP HERE

963
00:55:50,722 --> 00:55:52,557
-Sit down now.
-Well done.

964
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:53,641
SUCCESS

965
00:55:54,225 --> 00:55:55,185
Thank you.

966
00:55:55,977 --> 00:55:57,896
YUL GETS HELP AS WELL

967
00:56:12,410 --> 00:56:13,411
AND FINALLY, DAD ARRIVES

968
00:56:13,495 --> 00:56:14,871
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

969
00:56:17,957 --> 00:56:19,626
Here comes the last one.

970
00:56:19,709 --> 00:56:21,753
YE-EUN GOES LAST

971
00:56:21,836 --> 00:56:24,005
-Grab my leg.
-Your leg?

972
00:56:24,089 --> 00:56:25,590
Can you grab it?

973
00:56:26,341 --> 00:56:27,842
CLIMBING UP BY GRABBING ONTO HIS LEG

974
00:56:27,926 --> 00:56:29,803
-I seriously…
-Go up.

975
00:56:36,976 --> 00:56:38,520
Help me up.

976
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:42,857
-Grab the life vest.
-I got it.

977
00:56:42,941 --> 00:56:44,692
DRAGS UP

978
00:56:44,776 --> 00:56:46,694
-Grab the life vest.
-I got it.

979
00:56:47,278 --> 00:56:48,279
There you go.

980
00:56:53,701 --> 00:56:55,328
You look so funny.

981
00:56:56,871 --> 00:56:58,373
Push!

982
00:56:58,456 --> 00:57:00,375
You look so funny right now.

983
00:57:02,794 --> 00:57:04,504
You're almost there.

984
00:57:04,587 --> 00:57:07,132
She looks like frozen tuna.

985
00:57:07,715 --> 00:57:09,634
The viewership just skyrocketed.

986
00:57:14,639 --> 00:57:17,600
That's why we wear the life vests.

987
00:57:17,684 --> 00:57:18,685
I was wondering why.

988
00:57:18,768 --> 00:57:20,979
-That was hilarious.
-The funniest minute of the day.

989
00:57:21,771 --> 00:57:24,107
How did you feel
when you first saw this place?

990
00:57:24,190 --> 00:57:26,609
I thought it was very Kian-like.

991
00:57:26,693 --> 00:57:31,197
It felt like a scene from Fashion King
or Returning to School.

992
00:57:31,281 --> 00:57:33,241
Namaste. Thank you.

993
00:57:33,324 --> 00:57:35,285
That's all it was,

994
00:57:35,368 --> 00:57:37,537
but I was shocked
when we ate with our hands.

995
00:57:39,539 --> 00:57:42,333
I was outside,
and everyone was doing this.

996
00:57:42,417 --> 00:57:45,211
I almost peed my pants
because it was so funny.

997
00:57:45,295 --> 00:57:46,296
Seriously.

998
00:57:46,379 --> 00:57:49,924
-Please refrain from saying that.
-Why? It's a possible situation.

999
00:57:50,008 --> 00:57:52,343
Who pees their pants
because something is funny?

1000
00:57:52,427 --> 00:57:54,220
Everyone did when they were kids.

1001
00:57:54,304 --> 00:57:56,264
AT A LOSS FOR WORDS

1002
00:57:56,347 --> 00:58:01,478
-We might as well go see some insects.
-Yes, we were thinking about it.

1003
00:58:02,061 --> 00:58:03,938
RIGHT NOW?

1004
00:58:04,022 --> 00:58:05,899
IT'S BEST TO DO THAT AFTER IT RAINS

1005
00:58:05,982 --> 00:58:07,817
Don't kids like insects?

1006
00:58:07,901 --> 00:58:09,694
-What do you guys say?
-Should we go?

1007
00:58:11,112 --> 00:58:12,614
Whatever you two want to do.

1008
00:58:12,697 --> 00:58:13,948
-I want to go.
-You do?

1009
00:58:14,032 --> 00:58:15,909
What about you, Yul?

1010
00:58:16,826 --> 00:58:17,952
We'll go.

1011
00:58:18,036 --> 00:58:19,871
THE HA FAMILY JOINS THE KAIST TEAM

1012
00:58:19,954 --> 00:58:22,957
They're going out
in the middle of the night

1013
00:58:23,041 --> 00:58:24,334
to catch some bugs.

1014
00:58:24,417 --> 00:58:27,504
-You guys are going to make it big.
-I promise you it'll be a blast.

1015
00:58:27,587 --> 00:58:32,550
The 20-year-olds I know will go outside
at this hour to find a girlfriend,

1016
00:58:32,634 --> 00:58:34,093
not insects.

1017
00:58:34,177 --> 00:58:37,555
I hope you catch something
that's completely undiscovered.

1018
00:58:37,639 --> 00:58:39,182
OFF TO OBSERVE INSECTS

1019
00:58:39,265 --> 00:58:40,808
Take some videos.

1020
00:58:43,102 --> 00:58:48,149
I feel bad for making it tough on others
based on my standards.

1021
00:58:48,233 --> 00:58:49,692
-You know, right?
-Yes.

1022
00:58:49,776 --> 00:58:53,363
I've always watched you being you on TV.

1023
00:58:53,446 --> 00:58:56,699
I applied for this show
so I could join you.

1024
00:58:56,783 --> 00:58:58,576
-I get you.
-For real.

1025
00:58:58,660 --> 00:58:59,494
Really?

1026
00:58:59,577 --> 00:59:01,913
Didn't you feel the same
when you decided to come here?

1027
00:59:01,996 --> 00:59:03,706
I didn't want to do it alone.

1028
00:59:03,790 --> 00:59:05,833
But I could do it with other people.

1029
00:59:05,917 --> 00:59:09,420
Everyone came here to live like Kian.

1030
00:59:09,504 --> 00:59:12,840
I want a different, Kian-like experience.

1031
00:59:12,924 --> 00:59:14,884
Seriously, Jin.

1032
00:59:15,510 --> 00:59:17,262
You're my Buddha right now.

1033
00:59:17,345 --> 00:59:20,223
You're giving me so much courage.

1034
00:59:20,306 --> 00:59:23,017
-I'll support you from behind.
-Right.

1035
00:59:23,101 --> 00:59:24,519
-So we can do this.
-Okay.

1036
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:27,981
-What time is it?
-It's 12 a.m.

1037
00:59:28,064 --> 00:59:29,816
We need to go to sleep.

1038
00:59:29,899 --> 00:59:33,611
You wake up at 6 a.m. here
because it's so sunny.

1039
00:59:33,695 --> 00:59:36,114
-Good night.
-Remember to put your leg on a pillow.

1040
00:59:36,197 --> 00:59:38,491
Okay, I will.

1041
00:59:47,792 --> 00:59:52,630
YE-EUN ALSO GOES TO BED
IN HER SPACE ON THE SECOND FLOOR

1042
01:00:02,473 --> 01:00:05,393
THE KAIST TEAM AND THE HA FAMILY
AT THE SAME HOUR

1043
01:00:07,604 --> 01:00:09,022
We keep going up.

1044
01:00:10,898 --> 01:00:13,067
It must be really tough to drive here.

1045
01:00:13,151 --> 01:00:14,485
There are no streetlights.

1046
01:00:14,569 --> 01:00:18,948
FURTHER INTO THE DARK MOUNTAINS

1047
01:00:22,285 --> 01:00:24,329
-We're almost there.
-I think we're here.

1048
01:00:25,455 --> 01:00:26,623
This will be fun.

1049
01:00:31,753 --> 01:00:34,839
-I can hear lots of bugs.
-I've got a good feeling about this.

1050
01:00:36,633 --> 01:00:38,384
Let's set up a tent first.

1051
01:00:38,468 --> 01:00:39,636
I'm excited.

1052
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:41,429
Turn it on.

1053
01:00:50,063 --> 01:00:51,648
It's like we're in a new world.

1054
01:00:52,690 --> 01:00:54,400
I bet the insects will love this.

1055
01:00:54,484 --> 01:00:56,944
-There we go.
-This is a nightclub for bugs.

1056
01:00:57,028 --> 01:00:58,196
THE NIGHTCLUB IS OPEN

1057
01:00:58,279 --> 01:01:00,031
They can have fun in here.

1058
01:01:00,114 --> 01:01:02,408
PARTY BUGS

1059
01:01:02,492 --> 01:01:04,327
There are masks and gloves there.

1060
01:01:04,410 --> 01:01:05,703
I don't want to touch them.

1061
01:01:05,787 --> 01:01:07,747
-I just want to look.
-The moths are flying in.

1062
01:01:07,830 --> 01:01:09,415
The moths show up first.

1063
01:01:09,499 --> 01:01:11,084
-It's so cute.
-Really?

1064
01:01:11,167 --> 01:01:13,628
It's cute and furry.

1065
01:01:14,170 --> 01:01:15,880
-Do you want to take a look?
-Yes.

1066
01:01:16,381 --> 01:01:18,508
It's cute. It's like touching a pet.

1067
01:01:18,591 --> 01:01:20,134
-It's cute.
-Right?

1068
01:01:20,218 --> 01:01:21,969
-It has a baby face.
-It does.

1069
01:01:22,053 --> 01:01:24,472
It looks very innocent.

1070
01:01:24,555 --> 01:01:27,350
-It's cute.
-I didn't expect it to be so.

1071
01:01:27,433 --> 01:01:29,769
It's not nice when it flies at you.

1072
01:01:29,852 --> 01:01:31,437
When you look closely,

1073
01:01:31,521 --> 01:01:34,023
-bugs aren't that disgusting.
-Their eyes are quite pretty.

1074
01:01:34,107 --> 01:01:37,235
Some of them are, but not all of them.

1075
01:01:37,777 --> 01:01:40,154
-Come and look at this.
-It's a hawk moth.

1076
01:01:40,863 --> 01:01:42,281
THERETRA JAPONICA

1077
01:01:42,365 --> 01:01:45,243
People mistake it for a hummingbird.
It has a unique way of flying.

1078
01:01:45,326 --> 01:01:47,245
-It's huge.
-So interesting.

1079
01:01:48,454 --> 01:01:50,373
They're swarming to the light.

1080
01:01:50,456 --> 01:01:51,833
There are so many species of moth.

1081
01:01:51,916 --> 01:01:53,793
There's a grasshopper.

1082
01:01:53,876 --> 01:01:57,213
-As in The Ant and the Grasshopper.
-It's very pretty.

1083
01:01:57,296 --> 01:01:58,381
SICKLE-BEARING BUSH CRICKET

1084
01:01:59,006 --> 01:02:00,591
LELIA DECEMPUNCTATA

1085
01:02:00,675 --> 01:02:02,218
-So they stink?
-Yes.

1086
01:02:02,301 --> 01:02:04,804
-We have a beetle here.
-It's so cool.

1087
01:02:04,887 --> 01:02:05,763
It's a beetle.

1088
01:02:05,847 --> 01:02:07,140
HOLOTRICHIA PARALLELA

1089
01:02:08,516 --> 01:02:10,059
The light went out.

1090
01:02:10,143 --> 01:02:11,060
Let's go back.

1091
01:02:12,395 --> 01:02:14,021
RETURNING TO KIAN'S B&B

1092
01:02:14,105 --> 01:02:16,065
Good job, guys.

1093
01:02:16,149 --> 01:02:18,860
I don't feel tired
because it was so much fun.

1094
01:02:21,863 --> 01:02:25,074
-I'm sleepy.
-Take a nap. I'll wake you up.

1095
01:02:25,616 --> 01:02:27,493
It's good to take a quick nap.

1096
01:02:29,495 --> 01:02:30,538
-Dad.
-Yes?

1097
01:02:33,791 --> 01:02:35,126
Are you okay?

1098
01:02:35,209 --> 01:02:36,753
THE CAR SUDDENLY HIT A ROCK

1099
01:02:36,836 --> 01:02:39,338
-Are you okay, Dam?
-It doesn't hurt.

1100
01:02:39,422 --> 01:02:41,507
I'm fine too.
Are you sure you're okay, Yul?

1101
01:02:41,591 --> 01:02:44,218
I'm seriously fine.
It doesn't hurt anywhere.

1102
01:02:44,302 --> 01:02:46,888
-Did we hit something?
-Yes, we hit a rock.

1103
01:02:47,388 --> 01:02:48,765
-Are you okay, Mr. Ha?
-Yes.

1104
01:02:48,848 --> 01:02:50,224
You can sleep elsewhere.

1105
01:02:50,308 --> 01:02:54,020
I'm okay, but I'm afraid
Dam might get dizzy or throw up.

1106
01:02:54,103 --> 01:02:58,816
Then why don't you and the kids
sleep at the staff's lodging tonight?

1107
01:03:00,735 --> 01:03:04,405
KIAN'S BIZARRE B&B
