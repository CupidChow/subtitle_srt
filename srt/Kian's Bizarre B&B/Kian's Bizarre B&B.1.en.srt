1
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:21,980
KIAN BECAME THE OWNER

2
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:26,484
OF THE DREAM B&B HE DREW

3
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:33,450
I think it's a dreamlike house.

4
00:00:34,242 --> 00:00:37,328
I've seen it in some fantasy movies.

5
00:00:37,412 --> 00:00:39,164
It's like stepping into a webtoon.

6
00:00:44,502 --> 00:00:46,296
Yes, this is it.

7
00:00:51,342 --> 00:00:53,094
It's the definition of dreams and youth.

8
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:03,104
I think experiencing it once is enough.

9
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:05,690
We hope you enjoy your meal.

10
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:07,192
Let's eat with our hands today.

11
00:01:08,651 --> 00:01:09,652
It's disgusting.

12
00:01:13,114 --> 00:01:14,574
Pray to show you're grateful.

13
00:01:14,657 --> 00:01:16,534
Guys, if you lose this,

14
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:17,827
you won't be able to eat.

15
00:01:20,121 --> 00:01:21,414
It's nice.

16
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:23,625
What on earth is he trying to do here?

17
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:36,888
Kian's B&B is like
a smelly belly button.

18
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:40,266
It's bizarre and odd,
but you get addicted to it.

19
00:01:45,146 --> 00:01:48,024
I'm becoming more like you,
the more time I spend with you.

20
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:53,488
Bizarre. Nothing more, nothing less.

21
00:01:53,571 --> 00:01:55,448
-She's coming down. Move!
-Should I move?

22
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,159
You should move!

23
00:01:58,243 --> 00:01:59,285
Keep going up!

24
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:00,203
Hold on. Just go up.

25
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:02,664
How can you design it like this?

26
00:02:02,747 --> 00:02:03,998
My goodness!

27
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:07,001
Oh, my.

28
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:08,628
F***!

29
00:02:08,711 --> 00:02:10,130
Gosh, it's so annoying.

30
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:27,981
To all the guests at Kian's B&B,

31
00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:29,357
I wish you happiness!

32
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:33,862
You all have to be happy!

33
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:39,200
KIAN'S BIZARRE B&B

34
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:42,537
OPENING OF KIAN'S B&B

35
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:48,001
D-130, FIRST MEETING

36
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:52,338
Netflix headquarters.

37
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:55,884
It's amazing.

38
00:02:57,844 --> 00:02:58,720
Hello.

39
00:02:58,803 --> 00:03:00,930
-Hello.
-Hello.

40
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:03,600
We're honored to work
on a Netflix original show with you.

41
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:06,394
Who knew this day
would end up coming?

42
00:03:06,477 --> 00:03:09,856
We talked about working
on a fun project with you before.

43
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:11,941
To summarize it in one sentence,

44
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:15,904
we are opening up Kian's B&B
in Ulleungdo Island for the youth.

45
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:17,739
-Right.
-This one sentence says it all.

46
00:03:17,822 --> 00:03:19,657
With no special restrictions
or conditions.

47
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:21,117
Just like how Kian84 wants it.

48
00:03:21,242 --> 00:03:23,202
DO WHATEVER KIAN84 WANTS

49
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:24,746
To those who are coming as guests,

50
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:28,583
what should I do for them?

51
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:31,377
I have to wash the bedding, right?

52
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:35,381
Basically, it's a bed and breakfast.
That's what usual B&Bs do.

53
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:37,926
But the thing is…

54
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:39,302
If you leave it to my standards,

55
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:41,721
I'll just wash the bedding once.

56
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:44,432
I'll wash them after seven days.

57
00:03:44,515 --> 00:03:48,645
And I'll air them out,
and use them until the end.

58
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:50,813
For food…

59
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:52,190
I think…

60
00:03:52,273 --> 00:03:55,109
Coffee in the morning is enough.

61
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:57,570
Some kind of instant coffee.
Like Kanu Coffee.

62
00:03:57,654 --> 00:03:59,572
They're not even paying for the rooms.

63
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:02,992
I think it's enough.

64
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:04,994
For cleaning, I think…

65
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:08,081
It would be nice if we can clean the place
together in the morning.

66
00:04:08,164 --> 00:04:10,333
I think we can clean together.

67
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:13,920
Or we can take turns,
like doing weekly chores.

68
00:04:14,003 --> 00:04:15,797
You like to do things together.

69
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,173
I love doing group things.

70
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,759
I really like doing things together.

71
00:04:19,842 --> 00:04:23,930
When you look back later,
that's what you will remember.

72
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:25,348
You know why?

73
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:27,100
If it's comfortable,
the view's nice,

74
00:04:27,183 --> 00:04:28,768
and you eat all kinds of delicacies,

75
00:04:28,851 --> 00:04:30,311
it won't leave a lasting impression.

76
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:31,729
If it's easy, it isn't memorable.

77
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:36,109
I remember my days in the military.
Struggles leave a lasting impression.

78
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:37,527
That's why.

79
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:40,113
Let's not just go for something relaxing.

80
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:42,865
Those are just my thoughts.

81
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:44,075
Would it be nice

82
00:04:44,158 --> 00:04:46,536
if you have some staff
when you run the B&B?

83
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:47,954
Who can be my staff?

84
00:04:48,746 --> 00:04:50,623
Is there anyone you've wanted to meet?

85
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:52,041
Anyone you want to work with?

86
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,002
Personally, I've wanted to meet

87
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:55,837
the female trio of SNL.

88
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,130
Their energy is great.

89
00:04:58,089 --> 00:04:59,716
And the world will see this show.

90
00:05:00,341 --> 00:05:02,427
Shouldn't we have someone
who is globally famous?

91
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:04,095
Jennie.

92
00:05:05,221 --> 00:05:07,056
Oh, I spelled it wrong.

93
00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:09,600
G-Dragon.

94
00:05:12,186 --> 00:05:14,355
BTS. Wait, their military service…

95
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:16,399
Jin.

96
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:18,359
Can we cast him?

97
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,278
It would be amazing.

98
00:05:20,361 --> 00:05:21,612
I hope he can come.

99
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:25,366
If you build a house,
what would it look like?

100
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:29,120
I'm not sure if you have enough budget.

101
00:05:29,203 --> 00:05:31,622
I should make it cost-effective.

102
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:32,999
What do you think of this?

103
00:05:33,082 --> 00:05:35,460
I did my service
with the auxiliary police.

104
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:37,337
I used a bunk bed.

105
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,629
We'd put the blankets on.

106
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:40,882
When we did the roll call,

107
00:05:40,965 --> 00:05:42,383
it felt very efficient.

108
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:43,760
I like cost-effective things.

109
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:45,261
I want it to be efficient.

110
00:05:45,344 --> 00:05:47,305
I think I just need one big room.

111
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:49,724
Well, that means…

112
00:05:49,807 --> 00:05:51,559
No global star is going to come.

113
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:55,438
Where would you sleep then?

114
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:59,025
I think I can stay
with my platoon members.

115
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:01,861
A platoon leader
stays with his platoon members.

116
00:06:01,944 --> 00:06:03,446
It always ends up as a military camp.

117
00:06:04,238 --> 00:06:07,200
If possible,
how far could you imagine going?

118
00:06:07,283 --> 00:06:09,160
I can do a lot of things if I imagine.

119
00:06:09,243 --> 00:06:12,663
I can even make the place fly.

120
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:14,582
Just like in the movie Up.

121
00:06:14,665 --> 00:06:17,168
Maybe I can make it float on the sea.

122
00:06:17,251 --> 00:06:18,795
I did imagine those things before.

123
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:21,005
It shouldn't be ordinary.

124
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:23,633
I want to make it special and fun.

125
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:26,761
I can draw the B&B.

126
00:06:26,844 --> 00:06:30,640
We can do a tour on Ulleungdo Island
together to see if we can work it out.

127
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:31,974
-It's your call.
-Okay.

128
00:06:33,017 --> 00:06:35,186
-Okay.
-Thank you.

129
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:37,563
NEXT DAY

130
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:38,773
KIAN84: HELLO DIRECTOR!

131
00:06:38,856 --> 00:06:40,191
HELLO, WHAT IS IT?

132
00:06:40,274 --> 00:06:41,901
I'VE DECIDED ON HOW
TO BUILD MY B&B

133
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:43,402
HOW?

134
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:44,821
SINCE IT'S ULLEUNGDO,
LET'S BUILD…

135
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:45,780
WHAT?

136
00:06:45,863 --> 00:06:47,406
WE HAVE TO GO SEE IF IT'LL WORK

137
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:48,449
SEE YOU THEN

138
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:49,659
OKAY

139
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:52,995
SINCE IT'S ULLEUNGDO,
LET'S BUILD…

140
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:55,373
D-129, KIAN B&B SETUP COMPLETE

141
00:06:56,874 --> 00:06:58,793
D-117, ULLEUNGDO SITE VISIT

142
00:06:58,876 --> 00:07:01,254
POHANG PASSENGER TERMINAL, 6:30 A.M.

143
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:02,588
Hello.

144
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:07,718
We have to do a tour
and a sketch of the building.

145
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:09,679
I wish it was my land.

146
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:11,013
But it isn't.

147
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:12,014
Let's go.

148
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,267
Director, can we really afford this?

149
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:16,227
We can at least go take a look.

150
00:07:26,028 --> 00:07:27,196
This is nice.

151
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:31,659
GOING BAREFOOT IS BEST WHEN SEASICK

152
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:33,786
FROM POHANG,

153
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,371
IT TAKES 2 HOURS AND 50 MINUTES

154
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:36,289
ULLEUNGDO ISLAND

155
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:39,834
1 HOUR

156
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:41,752
2 HOURS

157
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:46,966
Wow, I can see it.

158
00:08:07,403 --> 00:08:09,322
It feels like the opening

159
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:11,657
of The Lost World: Jurassic Park.

160
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:13,618
Up to this point, it's great seeing this.

161
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:16,787
But those small dinosaurs, velociraptors,
start biting people.

162
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:19,248
KIAN'S WAY OF ADMIRING ULLEUNGDO

163
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:22,043
They get attacked
by those small velociraptors.

164
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:29,008
How far do we have to go?

165
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:30,676
About 20 minutes.

166
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,346
-How do you feel? Does it feel real?
-Right, it feels real.

167
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:35,806
The key is this.

168
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:38,726
I live in a good place and eat good food.

169
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:41,270
I should do the exact opposite here.

170
00:08:49,403 --> 00:08:50,947
We can get there with this boat.

171
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,990
-On this boat?
-Yes.

172
00:08:53,574 --> 00:08:58,371
ARE THEY GETTING ON ANOTHER BOAT?

173
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:02,833
I'm building a house here…

174
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:06,003
Well, I can build it.

175
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:16,013
We can sleep here, on the open sea.

176
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:17,515
It's like a house on top of water.

177
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:20,977
BARGE: A BOAT FOR CARRYING
CONSTRUCTION MATERIAL OR FREIGHT

178
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:24,313
A HOUSE WILL BE BUILT
ON TOP OF THIS BARGE

179
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:28,609
We can eat this seaweed

180
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:29,527
if we live here.

181
00:09:30,486 --> 00:09:32,238
We could survive for five days.

182
00:09:38,202 --> 00:09:39,287
So it's a bit rocky.

183
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:49,630
Oh, gosh.

184
00:09:51,048 --> 00:09:51,882
It's all sturdy.

185
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:53,050
DONE WITH SAFETY INSPECTION

186
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:55,219
People will think that it's a house.

187
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:57,471
But they are on the sea
when they get up the next day.

188
00:09:57,555 --> 00:09:59,557
LOVE IT

189
00:10:00,224 --> 00:10:03,603
We can build it high,
so we can put in bunk beds.

190
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:07,106
We should link it here.

191
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:09,775
It would be fun
if we can go fishing or swimming.

192
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:26,834
KIAN'S IMAGINATION

193
00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:28,753
WILL COME TRUE

194
00:10:28,836 --> 00:10:30,254
A HUGE PROJECT

195
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:31,714
OF BUILDING A HOUSE ON THE SEA

196
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:38,638
AUGUST 25TH

197
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:46,103
THE OPENING DAY OF KIAN'S B&B

198
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:47,605
HUPO PORT

199
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,526
HUPO ↔ ULLEUNG

200
00:10:57,823 --> 00:11:02,036
MEETING THE B&B STAFF FOR THE FIRST TIME
ON THE BOAT TO ULLEUNGDO ISLAND

201
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:10,419
WRONGLY BUTTONED

202
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:13,923
I'm nervous.

203
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:15,174
NERVOUS

204
00:11:18,677 --> 00:11:21,138
EMPTY

205
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:22,640
What? Nobody is here.

206
00:11:22,723 --> 00:11:24,100
EMBARRASSED

207
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:25,810
-Please take your shoes off.
-Over there.

208
00:11:25,893 --> 00:11:28,062
I have to take my shoes off. I'm sorry.

209
00:11:28,145 --> 00:11:29,230
STILL NERVOUS

210
00:11:31,315 --> 00:11:34,443
I've worked on many projects before.
But it's my first time running a B&B.

211
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,653
FIRST B&B BUSINESS

212
00:11:35,736 --> 00:11:37,279
I'm not worried about myself.

213
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:38,697
I'm worried about the staff.

214
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,575
They might think they're being pranked.

215
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:44,495
They probably wanted to eat something nice
in a peaceful place.

216
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:46,664
They'll be picturing that.

217
00:11:46,747 --> 00:11:47,915
They'll be shocked.

218
00:11:52,711 --> 00:11:54,630
Can I open the door? Anyone here?

219
00:11:57,007 --> 00:11:58,217
Hello.

220
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,427
When I was on SNL,

221
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:00,511
I liked her energy.

222
00:12:00,594 --> 00:12:02,012
She will become a star.

223
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:04,098
Oh, my gosh.

224
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:05,141
EMPLOYEE 1, JI YE-EUN

225
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:07,268
Hello.

226
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:08,894
Hello.

227
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:10,354
How have you been?

228
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:11,564
I've been fine.

229
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:13,524
What's wrong with your pants?

230
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:16,902
These are in trend.

231
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:18,446
-Baggy pants?
-Yes.

232
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:20,281
Please sit down.

233
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:22,950
-What's this?
-This is…

234
00:12:23,033 --> 00:12:24,535
This is what I prepared.

235
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:26,495
I want to have fun with this at the B&B.

236
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,205
I really like singing.

237
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:31,208
I have been really busy these days.

238
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:32,918
So I wanted to relax.

239
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:35,212
I want to meet the guests and have fun.

240
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:38,507
I thought it would be a vacation,
so I brought a lot of things.

241
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:41,177
I had this karaoke microphone at home.

242
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,928
It even has a disco ball.

243
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:45,097
And this blender
to make soy milk every morning.

244
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:46,474
Board games, like Halli Galli.

245
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:49,226
And a film camera.
I brought a film camera made of paper.

246
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:51,437
This disco ball works too.

247
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,730
So I brought it.

248
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:55,149
I don't think you will need it
when you get there.

249
00:12:55,232 --> 00:12:56,692
I think she got here thinking

250
00:12:56,775 --> 00:12:59,069
that our show is idyllic
like Hyori's Bed & Breakfast.

251
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:00,237
I feel bad for her.

252
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:02,198
I feel sorry.

253
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:04,158
You will have a lot to do.

254
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,204
-How old are you?
-I was born in 1994.

255
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:09,205
-In 1994.
-Right.

256
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:10,206
We're ten years apart.

257
00:13:10,831 --> 00:13:12,333
We've met twice. Can I talk casually?

258
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:13,792
-Yes, sure.
-Okay.

259
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:15,085
You can be casual too.

260
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:17,671
-No, I'm good. I'm good.
-Yeah? You don't want to?

261
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:19,131
I think it's a bit…

262
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:20,132
Am I second in rank?

263
00:13:20,674 --> 00:13:22,384
AM I SECOND IN RANK
AT KIAN'S B&B?

264
00:13:24,261 --> 00:13:26,347
KIAN84, B&B OWNER
EMPLOYEE YE-EUN, BORN IN 1994

265
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:27,640
EMPLOYEE 2: UNKNOWN, BORN IN…

266
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:29,892
I don't know who the third person is.

267
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:30,893
I have no idea either.

268
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:32,436
-I heard they're a top star.
-Right.

269
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:35,856
Because this is a Netflix show,
they invited someone globally famous.

270
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,316
They didn't tell me who it was.

271
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:39,610
-You really don't know?
-I have no idea.

272
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,282
-You really have no idea?
-No idea.

273
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:47,243
Goodness!

274
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:55,960
-Goodness!
-What?

275
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:57,586
Goodness.

276
00:13:58,629 --> 00:13:59,463
Hi.

277
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:01,382
Hey!

278
00:14:01,465 --> 00:14:02,383
Unbelievable.

279
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:04,176
It's BTS.

280
00:14:05,844 --> 00:14:06,971
How did they know?

281
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:09,014
HOW DID THEY KNOW
THAT I'M A MEMBER OF BTS?

282
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:10,933
KIAN'S B&B EMPLOYEE 2, JIN

283
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:13,018
-Netflix is amazing.
-I got chills now.

284
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:14,645
-I got chills!
-Goodness.

285
00:14:14,728 --> 00:14:16,021
Hello.

286
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:17,606
-Hello.
-Hello.

287
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:18,857
-My goodness.
-Hello.

288
00:14:19,483 --> 00:14:20,317
Hello.

289
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:23,487
STEPPING BACKWARD

290
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:25,698
This is amazing. I had no idea.

291
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:27,700
-Gosh, hello.
-Hello.

292
00:14:27,783 --> 00:14:30,077
-I've seen you a lot on TV.
-My goodness.

293
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,954
I loved your shows when I was in the army.

294
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:35,249
I told them that I wanted
to do a show with Kian.

295
00:14:35,332 --> 00:14:38,127
I saw Kian on YouTube a few times.

296
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:39,962
He was like a different species.

297
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:42,214
There are dogs and cats.
And we have Kian.

298
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:44,216
I found him very interesting.

299
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:48,804
So I wanted to know what he's really like
by spending some time together.

300
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,514
Please sit down.

301
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:54,435
SITTING FAR AWAY

302
00:14:54,518 --> 00:14:56,437
Gosh, what should I talk about?

303
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:58,814
Goodness.

304
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:00,816
This is awkward.

305
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:04,904
-I'm a fan of SNL.
-Thank you.

306
00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:06,947
"Gosh, it's so annoying."

307
00:15:11,827 --> 00:15:13,162
I've seen you on that show.

308
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:14,330
-Which one?
-With Jung-hwan.

309
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:15,873
Half-Star Hotel in Lost Island.

310
00:15:15,956 --> 00:15:17,082
I saw it on TV.

311
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:18,083
-You did?
-Yes.

312
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:20,294
You really saw it?
Did you see my episode?

313
00:15:20,377 --> 00:15:22,546
-Yes.
-Come on. Stop lying.

314
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:24,256
How did you know?

315
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:25,966
You spent two seconds thinking about it.

316
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:28,802
He probably said that
because he felt awkward around me.

317
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:31,013
People are always considerate to me.

318
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:31,931
But the thing is,

319
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:34,975
I want them to be more easygoing with me.

320
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:40,064
So, when I talk with someone,
I tend to be more straightforward.

321
00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:43,651
That way, we can grow closer
and relax around each other.

322
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:46,570
How old are you?

323
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:48,197
I was born in 1992.

324
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,615
-He was born in 1992.
-I see.

325
00:15:49,698 --> 00:15:51,700
-I was born in 1994.
-You are younger.

326
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:52,910
Nice to meet you.

327
00:15:52,993 --> 00:15:55,204
This is important.
Let's discuss how we call each other.

328
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:57,414
What should I call you?
Kian or Boss?

329
00:15:57,498 --> 00:15:59,083
-Call me Kian.
-Is that better?

330
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:01,335
-I'll just call you by your name.
-Sure, okay.

331
00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:02,461
I think I should…

332
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:03,587
-Should I brief you?
-Sure.

333
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:04,505
The B&B…

334
00:16:04,588 --> 00:16:05,673
I drew it.

335
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:07,007
-You drew the lodging?
-Yes.

336
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:09,843
This is Kian's B&B.

337
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,433
What exactly did you draw?

338
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:17,726
-What is this?
-Kian's B&B.

339
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:18,811
This is…

340
00:16:19,603 --> 00:16:21,522
It has two floors.

341
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:25,401
It's a two-story house?

342
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:27,444
ON GUARD

343
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:28,612
This is the entrance.

344
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:31,865
KIAN'S B&B INFO
THE ENTRANCE IS ON THE 2ND FLOOR

345
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:34,076
What? How do we get in?

346
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:35,911
You climb up here.

347
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:36,996
You go up like this.

348
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:39,581
Oh, please tell me that is not…

349
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:40,666
SERIOUSLY?

350
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:42,084
What? Wait.

351
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:43,043
SPEECHLESS

352
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:45,129
Oh, come on!

353
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:47,089
There is no door?

354
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:48,257
There is no door?

355
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,341
-Oar?
-I mean the door!

356
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:51,385
-Is the door up here?
-It's on the second floor.

357
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:53,303
How is this even a house?

358
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:55,472
I can't believe this.

359
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:57,016
My arms are very weak.

360
00:16:57,099 --> 00:16:58,600
You can't get in then.

361
00:16:58,684 --> 00:16:59,893
I mean it.

362
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:01,228
I just spit.

363
00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:02,521
Look at my arms.

364
00:17:02,604 --> 00:17:03,939
How can we climb up there?

365
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:05,024
You are quite fit.

366
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:07,443
How am I fit?

367
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:08,736
How do we take the luggage up?

368
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:10,195
You have to carry it on your back.

369
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:11,238
It's a suitcase.

370
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:15,743
-There are 11 guest rooms.
-There are 11 rooms?

371
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:16,660
We have 11 rooms.

372
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:17,911
Why do you have so many?

373
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:19,371
These are the guest rooms here.

374
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:21,498
You have to sleep on the hanging beds.

375
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:23,250
HANGING BEDS OUTSIDE THE BUILDING

376
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:24,918
-What?
-You sleep on the hanging bed.

377
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:25,836
What? What is…

378
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:28,130
LOSING HER MIND

379
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:29,298
Come on!

380
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:31,258
Don't joke around.

381
00:17:31,341 --> 00:17:32,468
I mean it.

382
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:34,011
I'm a very sensitive sleeper.

383
00:17:34,094 --> 00:17:36,513
I need blackout curtains…
I need them to sleep.

384
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:37,514
All right. I get you.

385
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:39,266
I have a music video to shoot in a month.

386
00:17:39,349 --> 00:17:41,769
What if I get all burned in the morning
because of the sun?

387
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:42,811
He can't get sunburned.

388
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:44,354
Listen. This is what's important.

389
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:47,649
As I planned this, I realized today…

390
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:48,692
You realized today?

391
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:51,111
When it rains, we have nowhere to run.

392
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:52,237
Is this outdoors?

393
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:53,363
Of course.

394
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:56,366
You know why
I wanted to design it like this?

395
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:57,910
-Okay, let's hear your story.
-We…

396
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:01,914
It's like I'm explaining myself
for doing something wrong.

397
00:18:01,997 --> 00:18:03,457
I wanted to do this.

398
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:06,376
While sleeping on the hanging beds,
the moon shows up at night.

399
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:09,254
It's going to be so beautiful.

400
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:10,422
It sounds idyllic, though.

401
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:11,590
-Nice.
-Right.

402
00:18:11,673 --> 00:18:13,509
I give up very fast.

403
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:17,012
What can I do? I have no other choice.
Let's just quickly adjust.

404
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,013
You climb up here.

405
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:19,348
STAGE 1 - SURPRISE

406
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:20,891
STAGE 2 - ANGER

407
00:18:20,974 --> 00:18:23,393
STAGE 3 - COMPLIANCE

408
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:25,479
The moment I accept the reality
and get used to it,

409
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:27,272
I just get happier.

410
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:28,524
It sounds idyllic, though.

411
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:30,109
FINAL STAGE - HAPPINESS

412
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:31,610
-It's idyllic.
-That's right.

413
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:33,278
When you get to the second floor,

414
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:35,531
this is what's inside.

415
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:37,658
I love the show High Kick!

416
00:18:37,741 --> 00:18:38,700
I love it too.

417
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:39,910
But…

418
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:44,540
THEY HAVE TO USE THE POLE
TO GET TO DIFFERENT FLOORS

419
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:46,208
We have to climb this every day?

420
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:47,501
-Like this?
-Hold on a second.

421
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:49,419
-No door on the first floor?
-What about this?

422
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:52,881
-You use this if you want to go down?
-Yes. But this is what's important.

423
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:55,217
When you go up,
you have to go up with this again.

424
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,927
This is too much.

425
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:59,012
How can you design it like this?

426
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:01,056
Who would live here?

427
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,643
I LIVE HERE

428
00:19:05,727 --> 00:19:07,062
Who would live here?

429
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:09,231
You can get up
by climbing the air conditioner.

430
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:11,400
That's a great idea too.

431
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:13,193
You sure are smart.

432
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:14,403
Right, yes.

433
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:16,488
-I told you.
-You're right.

434
00:19:17,197 --> 00:19:18,115
And this is important.

435
00:19:18,198 --> 00:19:20,492
This is the ocean.

436
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:23,579
-What?
-Oh, I haven't told you. This is a barge.

437
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:25,289
-What?
-We're sleeping on this barge.

438
00:19:27,207 --> 00:19:29,334
KIAN'S B&B

439
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:33,046
A HOUSE ON TOP OF THE SEA

440
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:34,965
This is a barge.

441
00:19:35,632 --> 00:19:37,467
-Kian's B&B is…
-What is this?

442
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:40,429
SPEECHLESS

443
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:41,805
This is a joke.

444
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:42,973
This is all a joke.

445
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:46,560
THIS ISN'T A JOKE

446
00:19:46,643 --> 00:19:48,020
But I did set it up

447
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:49,813
with five-star hotel facilities.

448
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:53,400
We have to serve them breakfast.

449
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:56,403
There is a swimming pool and a gym.

450
00:19:56,486 --> 00:19:58,238
There is a gym over here.

451
00:19:58,322 --> 00:19:59,615
KIAN'S FIVE-STAR B&B?

452
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:01,325
Who are coming as guests?

453
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:02,367
I don't know.

454
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,786
These guests…

455
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:09,249
Over 30,000 applicants applied.
They interviewed each potential guest.

456
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:12,544
A TOTAL OF 35,200 TEAMS APPLIED

457
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:14,880
2,000 INTERVIEWS CONDUCTED

458
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:16,590
How would Kian's B&B look like?

459
00:20:16,673 --> 00:20:18,175
Hunting and gathering?

460
00:20:18,258 --> 00:20:19,218
We'd probably eat dirt.

461
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:20,761
We might have to be self-sufficient.

462
00:20:20,844 --> 00:20:22,512
We might have to live in the wild.

463
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:24,264
Do I have to make him breakfast?

464
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:25,515
Feel like there'd be nothing.

465
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:27,851
It'd be like a Hyori's Bed & Breakfast
episode from hell.

466
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:29,937
I want to play with Kian in the pool
in our boxers.

467
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:31,313
That would be a dream.

468
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:32,898
It will be relaxing in Kian's way.

469
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:34,858
OVERFLOWING WITH TALENT

470
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:36,151
CRAZY ENERGY

471
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:38,612
EVEN MORE KIAN-LIKE THAN KIAN

472
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:41,156
GUESTS FOR KIAN'S B&B ARE READY

473
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,866
-So I counted.
-Yes.

474
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:45,035
It's like the production crew

475
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:47,871
counseled students
from 20 different high schools.

476
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:50,040
-Sounds exhausting.
-Are the guests all students?

477
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:52,251
No, it's not that.

478
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:53,585
It was similar to that.

479
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:55,379
-Right.
-That's how huge it was.

480
00:20:55,462 --> 00:20:57,172
I got it.

481
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:58,590
You got it? I'm tired now.

482
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:02,177
THE FIRST GUESTS ARE EXPECTED TODAY

483
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:08,308
Anyway, thank you for coming to help.

484
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:11,395
I feel so bad I can't even face them.

485
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:13,522
Why? I think it's going to be fun.

486
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:14,439
You think so?

487
00:21:16,733 --> 00:21:17,943
What? What happened?

488
00:21:18,026 --> 00:21:19,695
BROKEN

489
00:21:21,321 --> 00:21:23,282
-This isn't a good sign.
-I have a bad feeling.

490
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:25,575
How do we bring up our luggage?

491
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:27,494
I know. That's the problem.

492
00:21:30,497 --> 00:21:31,915
My gosh.

493
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:33,250
I should break these too.

494
00:21:35,085 --> 00:21:36,128
It's not a good sign.

495
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:37,629
Is it a sign of our future?

496
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:39,840
It's going to be a huge hit.

497
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:44,136
MEANWHILE, ON ULLEUNGDO ISLAND

498
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:50,017
Typhoon Shanshan is moving north
at a slow pace.

499
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:53,061
It is expected to bring strong rain
and winds of 30 meters per second.

500
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:56,273
There is a possibility
that a typhoon warning will be issued.

501
00:21:58,233 --> 00:22:01,361
TYPHOON SHANSHAN ARRIVES
ON ULLEUNGDO

502
00:22:08,702 --> 00:22:10,078
We are in big trouble.

503
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:12,581
The wind is so strong.

504
00:22:21,131 --> 00:22:23,258
The wind usually isn't this strong.

505
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:24,593
Gosh, the wind…

506
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:26,720
-My gosh.
-I can't walk.

507
00:22:27,471 --> 00:22:28,889
I can't walk.

508
00:22:29,806 --> 00:22:31,641
The wind is too strong.

509
00:22:31,725 --> 00:22:33,101
Our B&B.

510
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:34,895
I'm not sure if it's intact.

511
00:22:34,978 --> 00:22:36,146
The wind is too strong.

512
00:22:36,229 --> 00:22:37,481
This isn't good.

513
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:39,608
Unbelievable.

514
00:22:41,651 --> 00:22:42,986
I'm so worried now.

515
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:44,362
I'm at a loss for words.

516
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:45,572
-What's wrong now?
-I mean…

517
00:22:45,655 --> 00:22:47,991
Kian's B&B is floating on the sea.

518
00:22:48,075 --> 00:22:50,243
-Because of the typhoon…
-Are you afraid it will shake?

519
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:53,413
Things are blown around
in a typhoon

520
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:55,749
and you get hurt if they hit you.

521
00:22:55,832 --> 00:22:58,543
If the wind is that strong,

522
00:22:59,336 --> 00:23:00,670
we can't sleep on the sea.

523
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:02,964
-It's not possible.
-Right.

524
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:05,675
I don't know where we can sleep tonight.

525
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:07,094
Where are we sleeping tonight?

526
00:23:11,181 --> 00:23:13,683
12:30 P.M.

527
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:15,435
-This is Ulleungdo.
-Goodness.

528
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:18,188
Let's get on a taxi first.

529
00:23:18,271 --> 00:23:19,773
-Taxi.
-Sounds good.

530
00:23:19,856 --> 00:23:21,525
-Hello.
-Hello.

531
00:23:21,608 --> 00:23:22,609
Hello.

532
00:23:22,692 --> 00:23:23,693
How was the ride?

533
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:25,529
I heard there's a typhoon coming.

534
00:23:26,446 --> 00:23:27,322
Shanshan.

535
00:23:27,405 --> 00:23:28,907
-Shansham?
-Shanshan.

536
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:30,117
It's called Shansham?

537
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,993
-Shanshan.
-Typhoon Shamshan?

538
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:33,495
SHANSHAN, NOT SHAMSHAN

539
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:35,622
On Ulleungdo…

540
00:23:36,289 --> 00:23:38,041
-It depends on the wind's direction.
-Right.

541
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:40,836
One side could be calm.
The other could have strong waves.

542
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:42,671
The wind's blowing
from the northeast today.

543
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:44,381
Depending on the direction…

544
00:23:44,464 --> 00:23:48,343
I have a feeling
the B&B is on the east side.

545
00:23:49,427 --> 00:23:51,596
KIAN'S B&B IS ON THE NORTH SIDE
OF ULLEUNGDO

546
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,473
CURRENT LOCATION

547
00:23:53,557 --> 00:23:55,851
Shoot, this is…

548
00:24:00,021 --> 00:24:01,898
The waves seem high.

549
00:24:02,732 --> 00:24:05,652
THE WAVES LOOK STRONGER IN PERSON

550
00:24:05,735 --> 00:24:07,404
I'll be seasick for sure.

551
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:10,740
So the rocks fall from here?

552
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:18,498
FALLEN ROCKS HERE AND THERE

553
00:24:19,082 --> 00:24:24,212
A CAR ACCIDENT DUE TO HEAVY RAIN

554
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:26,214
THIS IS TERRIBLE

555
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:28,175
This is…

556
00:24:28,258 --> 00:24:29,217
What?

557
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:30,218
How come…

558
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:33,013
I'm not excited at all. I'm just worried.

559
00:24:33,763 --> 00:24:35,098
I was in a state of panic.

560
00:24:37,392 --> 00:24:39,561
You don't know
when the typhoon will pass.

561
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:42,522
I wanted to give it a grand opening.

562
00:24:43,481 --> 00:24:49,613
WORRIED AS THEY'RE HEADING TO KIAN'S B&B

563
00:24:55,076 --> 00:24:55,911
Is that it?

564
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:58,163
Where?

565
00:24:58,872 --> 00:25:00,248
-Where?
-Where?

566
00:25:01,374 --> 00:25:02,709
There.

567
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:06,004
That?

568
00:25:16,723 --> 00:25:17,974
What is that?

569
00:25:24,314 --> 00:25:27,984
KIAN'S B&B

570
00:25:36,576 --> 00:25:39,079
This is crazy.

571
00:25:39,162 --> 00:25:41,039
I thought it was an amusement park.

572
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:47,295
-What is this?
-Seriously, what is this?

573
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:48,880
Do we actually have to climb up?

574
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:53,426
It's higher than I thought.

575
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:55,637
You can't place it
in the middle of the second floor.

576
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,305
You have to put it at the far end.

577
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,850
That way, we have to climb
as high as possible to go in.

578
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:02,894
I have a fear of heights.

579
00:26:06,022 --> 00:26:07,774
What? Do we sleep there?

580
00:26:07,857 --> 00:26:08,984
Are those the beds?

581
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:10,068
They really built it.

582
00:26:10,151 --> 00:26:12,529
There aren't any mattresses?

583
00:26:13,947 --> 00:26:17,117
I made an outdoor sleeping zone.

584
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,618
We will sleep here.

585
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:22,330
There are cabinets right above you
for your personal things.

586
00:26:24,791 --> 00:26:27,794
You get on the slide to get down
right to the sea.

587
00:26:27,877 --> 00:26:29,212
My goodness.

588
00:26:29,296 --> 00:26:30,588
You slip right into the sea.

589
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:34,050
A WATER SLIDE THAT GOES STRAIGHT
INTO THE SEA

590
00:26:34,134 --> 00:26:37,012
So this is where people sleep.

591
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:41,182
On the other side of this wall,
you will see a gym.

592
00:26:45,312 --> 00:26:48,189
We will fill these huge buckets
with water.

593
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:51,067
On the other side is a zone for tea.

594
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:52,485
I want to go to the teatime zone.

595
00:26:52,569 --> 00:26:55,447
I wanted people to face each other here.

596
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:57,365
I made it so faces
would be gathered here.

597
00:26:58,783 --> 00:27:00,660
I'll stick the tables near the walls.

598
00:27:00,744 --> 00:27:02,203
A FORCED FACE-TO-FACE TEA TIME ZONE

599
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:03,788
We will take that out to the sea.

600
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:04,914
-Incredible.
-What?

601
00:27:04,998 --> 00:27:06,333
-Take it out to the sea?
-What?

602
00:27:06,416 --> 00:27:10,962
WE WILL GO OUT TO THE SEA
WHEN THE WEATHER IS NICE

603
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:13,089
KIAN'S B&B

604
00:27:21,681 --> 00:27:25,810
ANCHORED TO THE PORT FOR NOW

605
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:27,145
I mean, this is…

606
00:27:28,188 --> 00:27:29,606
What is this?

607
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:33,651
I can't believe this!

608
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:37,906
What is this?

609
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:39,866
How do we go up?

610
00:27:39,949 --> 00:27:41,993
You made the climbing zone hard.

611
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:43,995
How can we climb up?

612
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:44,996
SHOCKED

613
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,289
-I mean climbing up…
-No, no.

614
00:27:46,373 --> 00:27:48,124
We have to sleep up there.

615
00:27:51,127 --> 00:27:52,420
We sleep there.

616
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:53,588
-Hold on. Originally…
-Wait.

617
00:27:53,671 --> 00:27:55,673
But what if we roll in bed
and fall down?

618
00:27:55,757 --> 00:27:56,591
Right.

619
00:27:56,674 --> 00:27:58,927
You might get hurt
if you fall from there while sleeping.

620
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:00,845
We have an extra mat below.

621
00:28:01,471 --> 00:28:03,556
-So if you fall…
-What if we fall?

622
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:06,476
If you fall on the mat,
you climb up and go back to sleep.

623
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:08,686
You won't be sleepy anymore
after climbing up.

624
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:11,356
So you have to be careful
not to fall while sleeping.

625
00:28:12,315 --> 00:28:13,316
It's close to my drawing.

626
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:16,069
This is very shocking.

627
00:28:16,152 --> 00:28:17,821
How can we sleep up there?

628
00:28:17,904 --> 00:28:18,738
But you know what?

629
00:28:18,822 --> 00:28:21,533
Except for the top bunks,
you won't get wet from the rain.

630
00:28:21,616 --> 00:28:23,493
THE ONLY OPTIMISTIC ONE IS THE OWNER

631
00:28:23,576 --> 00:28:24,953
The beds below will still get wet.

632
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:27,580
Rain doesn't fall straight down.
It's blown in by the wind.

633
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:28,665
But you'll get less wet.

634
00:28:28,748 --> 00:28:29,666
STILL OPTIMISTIC

635
00:28:29,749 --> 00:28:32,836
Those in the top beds
will be woken up by the sun.

636
00:28:33,837 --> 00:28:36,297
How about the staff sleep on the rooftop?

637
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:37,632
No.

638
00:28:37,715 --> 00:28:38,925
-Why not?
-Because…

639
00:28:39,008 --> 00:28:40,468
We should sleep with the guests.

640
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:42,178
We have to show that we are one.

641
00:28:43,179 --> 00:28:44,597
I can't give you any privileges.

642
00:28:44,681 --> 00:28:46,474
KIAN'S PHILOSOPHY
STAFF AND GUESTS ARE ONE

643
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:48,476
I was hopeful for a minute.

644
00:28:49,185 --> 00:28:50,270
You know what?

645
00:28:50,854 --> 00:28:52,856
I think the guests will complain.

646
00:28:53,523 --> 00:28:55,316
-The guests?
-No, they won't.

647
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,569
-They probably already know.
-No, they don't.

648
00:28:57,652 --> 00:28:58,611
-They don't?
-No.

649
00:28:58,695 --> 00:29:01,072
You two didn't know this either.
How would the guests know?

650
00:29:03,199 --> 00:29:05,160
This is very bizarre.

651
00:29:08,538 --> 00:29:09,706
And hold on.

652
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:11,624
Can't we get in?

653
00:29:12,542 --> 00:29:14,586
This is the Ulleung Coast Guard Station.

654
00:29:14,669 --> 00:29:17,839
Sir, we arrived on Ulleungdo Island today.

655
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:20,341
We built a house on a barge.

656
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:22,260
-And…
-You built a house on a barge?

657
00:29:22,343 --> 00:29:23,470
Well, here is the story.

658
00:29:23,553 --> 00:29:24,554
The barge.

659
00:29:24,637 --> 00:29:26,598
Where should I start?

660
00:29:26,681 --> 00:29:29,100
Would it be dangerous
if we go out to sea today?

661
00:29:29,184 --> 00:29:30,894
-Because of the typhoon?
-Well…

662
00:29:30,977 --> 00:29:33,104
Sir, the weather is…

663
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:34,939
-We have a typhoon coming.
-Right.

664
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:38,067
-It's going to affect the Ulleungdo area.
-Right.

665
00:29:38,151 --> 00:29:39,319
Where are you heading today?

666
00:29:39,402 --> 00:29:40,945
-North to Hyeonpo-ri.
-Hyeonpo-ri.

667
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:42,405
-Hyeonpo-ri.
-Hyeonpo-ri.

668
00:29:42,489 --> 00:29:43,823
Hyeonpo-ri is in the north.

669
00:29:43,907 --> 00:29:47,118
With winds coming from the northeast,
swell waves are strong there, so…

670
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:49,329
Okay, sir. Thank you.

671
00:29:49,412 --> 00:29:50,371
You're welcome.

672
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:53,291
He's right. I saw a lot of waves.
They seemed strong.

673
00:29:57,462 --> 00:30:00,632
DECIDED TO TEMPORARILY CLOSE FOR SAFETY

674
00:30:00,715 --> 00:30:01,549
What do we do?

675
00:30:02,091 --> 00:30:05,845
WILL KIAN'S B&B BE UNABLE TO OPEN?

676
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:07,263
Well…

677
00:30:14,395 --> 00:30:15,480
So…

678
00:30:16,564 --> 00:30:17,690
I have a plan B.

679
00:30:17,774 --> 00:30:19,943
-I knew it!
-Plan B! Yes. I knew you had it.

680
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:21,903
You had a plan B!

681
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:26,157
I did think people would get sick
if we slept here.

682
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:27,242
Sir!

683
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:28,910
We have an annex.

684
00:30:28,993 --> 00:30:30,620
-We do?
-Yes, an annex.

685
00:30:30,703 --> 00:30:33,414
We have this zone next to the sea
and another zone in the mountains.

686
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:35,083
We have a great system there.

687
00:30:36,459 --> 00:30:38,461
DURING THE VISIT TO ULLEUNGDO ISLAND
3 MONTHS AGO

688
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:39,796
This rocks up and down a lot.

689
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:44,092
People will be throwing up like crazy.

690
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:47,846
I'm worried nothing will work out,
trying to chase this romantic idea.

691
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:50,515
So we need a separate B&B just in case.

692
00:30:50,598 --> 00:30:53,142
It would be nice if we can build it
on a mountain slope.

693
00:30:53,226 --> 00:30:54,143
An annex.

694
00:30:54,227 --> 00:30:56,604
We'll show you the land
that was introduced to us.

695
00:30:58,022 --> 00:30:59,440
We are going up quite far.

696
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:00,859
I'm feeling pressure in my ears.

697
00:31:05,572 --> 00:31:06,573
Is that it?

698
00:31:06,656 --> 00:31:07,949
I told you there was a monorail.

699
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:09,075
Nice.

700
00:31:09,158 --> 00:31:11,786
We have to transfer
onto this to get there.

701
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:14,330
YOU NEED TO TAKE THE MONORAIL TO GET THERE

702
00:31:14,414 --> 00:31:15,498
Do I get on?

703
00:31:15,582 --> 00:31:16,666
Sir, hold on.

704
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:18,251
Hold on tight.

705
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:28,803
Oh my!

706
00:31:30,972 --> 00:31:32,974
We can't get there by car?

707
00:31:33,641 --> 00:31:34,517
No, we can't.

708
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:35,518
No way!

709
00:31:44,277 --> 00:31:47,530
NATURE-FRIENDLY MONORAIL

710
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:55,955
How far are we going?

711
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:57,415
How far?

712
00:31:57,498 --> 00:32:00,501
IT TAKES A TOTAL
OF 7 MINUTES AND 30 SECONDS

713
00:32:01,669 --> 00:32:03,838
The scenery is beautiful.

714
00:32:05,715 --> 00:32:08,760
We can't see the scenery
if we don't ride this.

715
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:15,016
Oh, gosh.

716
00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:19,103
HIGH AND DEEP
IN THE MOUNTAINS OF ULLEUNGDO

717
00:32:19,812 --> 00:32:20,730
This must be it.

718
00:32:21,564 --> 00:32:22,565
What?

719
00:32:22,649 --> 00:32:23,942
IS THIS THE ANNEX OF KIAN'S B&B?

720
00:32:25,693 --> 00:32:27,570
INCREDULOUS LAUGH

721
00:32:28,321 --> 00:32:32,825
It feels like where the demon
of The Wailing lives.

722
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:35,870
I think it's been empty for a while.

723
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:37,330
A HOUSE LEFT EMPTY FOR 10 YEARS

724
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:42,293
The door is…

725
00:32:44,128 --> 00:32:45,296
Darn.

726
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:55,682
SHOCKED

727
00:32:56,933 --> 00:33:00,103
-So they're renting this out?
-Yes.

728
00:33:00,186 --> 00:33:01,104
We're renting it?

729
00:33:06,192 --> 00:33:07,443
How old is this?

730
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:12,907
This seems like it's 100 years old.

731
00:33:15,451 --> 00:33:16,536
We can use this light here.

732
00:33:17,078 --> 00:33:18,079
It's actually working.

733
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:22,959
Man, this place uses a fireplace.

734
00:33:26,629 --> 00:33:28,840
I think we'll have to
renovate it a lot.

735
00:33:28,923 --> 00:33:30,008
WE HAVE A LOT TO FIX

736
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:34,303
SIGH

737
00:33:34,387 --> 00:33:35,304
Well…

738
00:33:35,972 --> 00:33:37,807
We should draw a plan

739
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:40,351
to remodel this place.

740
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:43,312
KIAN'S B&B ANNEX

741
00:33:45,231 --> 00:33:46,274
How many stars is it?

742
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:48,484
It's about a three-star lodging.

743
00:33:48,568 --> 00:33:50,028
This is a five-star lodging.

744
00:33:50,111 --> 00:33:52,572
This is a five-star?
I can't even imagine the three-star…

745
00:33:52,655 --> 00:33:53,948
Shall we go?

746
00:33:55,116 --> 00:33:57,660
OPENING OF THE MAIN LODGING
ON THE SEA POSTPONED

747
00:33:58,494 --> 00:33:59,704
ON THEIR WAY TO THE ANNEX

748
00:33:59,787 --> 00:34:01,164
We're going up quite high.

749
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:05,293
I was going to show this later…

750
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:07,712
-Was it like a card up your sleeve?
-It was.

751
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:11,215
It's not too bad to see it early.

752
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:12,383
A card up his sleeve.

753
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:16,137
We've arrived.

754
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:17,055
Here?

755
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:19,432
IS THIS THE ANNEX?

756
00:34:19,515 --> 00:34:20,808
This is amazing.

757
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:24,604
What is this?

758
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:27,523
Why on earth is…

759
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:29,942
-We're riding this down?
-We're riding this down?

760
00:34:30,026 --> 00:34:31,277
No way.

761
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:34,113
How can we…

762
00:34:34,197 --> 00:34:35,448
How can we get on this?

763
00:34:35,531 --> 00:34:36,365
I mean, this…

764
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:38,701
-This looks scary!
-It's too steep.

765
00:34:38,785 --> 00:34:39,994
-Too steep.
-It looks scary.

766
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:40,912
This is quite heavy,

767
00:34:40,995 --> 00:34:43,081
so you might depart forever
if the brake comes loose.

768
00:34:43,164 --> 00:34:44,624
-So strap in.
-And our luggage?

769
00:34:44,707 --> 00:34:46,459
I should use mine as an airbag.

770
00:34:46,542 --> 00:34:48,377
-Have you ridden this before?
-I have.

771
00:34:48,461 --> 00:34:49,545
Be careful.

772
00:34:50,213 --> 00:34:51,881
Gosh, it's scary now.

773
00:34:51,964 --> 00:34:53,257
It's scary.

774
00:34:53,341 --> 00:34:54,509
How do we…

775
00:34:57,595 --> 00:35:00,640
-Are you ready to go?
-Yes.

776
00:35:00,723 --> 00:35:02,183
Hold on.

777
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:04,143
What if we fall?

778
00:35:05,394 --> 00:35:06,646
What if we fall?

779
00:35:06,729 --> 00:35:07,980
-My gosh!
-Let's go.

780
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:17,031
What is this?

781
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:18,366
-Goodness.
-Hey!

782
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:19,450
What is this?

783
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:22,370
-What is this?
-My feet are going numb.

784
00:35:23,329 --> 00:35:24,539
Gosh, that scared me.

785
00:35:27,083 --> 00:35:28,084
What the heck?

786
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:31,337
Why are you screaming?

787
00:35:32,046 --> 00:35:34,132
I get scared if it gets scary!

788
00:35:35,091 --> 00:35:37,051
-What is this?
-Goodness.

789
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:38,719
What? What is this?

790
00:35:39,345 --> 00:35:40,972
The guests will arrive like this too?

791
00:35:41,055 --> 00:35:43,599
-Everyone gets here on this.
-What if there is a snake?

792
00:35:43,683 --> 00:35:45,017
If a snake bites you,

793
00:35:45,101 --> 00:35:46,644
I'll suck out the venom.

794
00:35:49,272 --> 00:35:51,232
What is this?

795
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:52,817
-Gosh.
-This is incredible.

796
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,235
What a unique experience.

797
00:35:55,862 --> 00:35:57,613
But the view is amazing.

798
00:35:57,697 --> 00:35:58,906
This is incredible.

799
00:36:00,616 --> 00:36:01,534
It's pretty.

800
00:36:01,617 --> 00:36:02,785
This is fun, though.

801
00:36:03,536 --> 00:36:05,079
This is amazing.

802
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:07,123
Did you make the path
or did this exist already?

803
00:36:07,206 --> 00:36:09,500
They had it. But we remodeled it.

804
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:11,836
What is that? Are those lights?

805
00:36:11,919 --> 00:36:13,337
I wanted it to have cool vibes.

806
00:36:14,297 --> 00:36:16,340
-Goodness.
-It's pretty.

807
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:18,342
It's so well-decorated.

808
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:19,594
Let me take a video for you.

809
00:36:23,222 --> 00:36:25,683
It feels like
we're going into a secret world.

810
00:36:26,893 --> 00:36:29,270
The moment I thought,
"Where are we heading?"

811
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:32,356
a picturesque scene unfolded before me.

812
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:34,942
This is so pretty.

813
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:39,280
Well, now…

814
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:42,283
I see another steep slope.

815
00:36:51,083 --> 00:36:53,044
How do we even go down?

816
00:36:53,502 --> 00:36:54,712
GRABBING TIGHTLY

817
00:36:54,795 --> 00:36:56,422
-My gosh!
-Hey.

818
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:58,174
This is…

819
00:36:58,841 --> 00:36:59,675
I'm scared.

820
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:02,094
How does this even work?

821
00:37:06,307 --> 00:37:08,184
-Aren't these perilla leaves?
-They are.

822
00:37:08,267 --> 00:37:10,603
Pick some vegetables on the way
if you see any.

823
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,855
We can eat them with meat.

824
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:14,440
I see it there.

825
00:37:14,523 --> 00:37:16,400
-So it's that house.
-I see it now.

826
00:37:17,151 --> 00:37:18,402
This is your plan B.

827
00:37:20,821 --> 00:37:22,531
One of the locals used to live here.

828
00:37:22,615 --> 00:37:25,117
Now, they don't. It's the red house.

829
00:37:25,201 --> 00:37:26,452
Wow, it's amazing.

830
00:37:26,535 --> 00:37:30,581
KIAN'S B&B
ANNEX

831
00:37:31,582 --> 00:37:33,000
How did they…

832
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:34,001
This is incredible.

833
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:38,256
You call this a hotel?

834
00:37:39,006 --> 00:37:40,424
"Kian's B&B."

835
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:42,760
This is our annex.

836
00:37:42,843 --> 00:37:44,095
This is the second B&B.

837
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:46,555
Sir, the window screen is torn.

838
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:47,515
The window screen?

839
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,477
Don't worry. We'll heat up the fireplace.

840
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:55,439
The door won't open.

841
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:57,775
Boss, the dust…

842
00:38:05,032 --> 00:38:06,450
Everyone.

843
00:38:07,243 --> 00:38:08,494
Isn't it nice?

844
00:38:09,495 --> 00:38:11,414
Since we'll have guests,
we took the ceiling…

845
00:38:11,914 --> 00:38:13,916
-You raised its height?
-Yeah, we did.

846
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:18,212
We should get rid of everything.

847
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:20,506
By building it like a military dorm,

848
00:38:20,589 --> 00:38:23,009
we can lodge the most people
at the lowest cost.

849
00:38:23,092 --> 00:38:24,760
BEFORE

850
00:38:24,844 --> 00:38:26,595
AFTER

851
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:32,810
And that's the fireplace.

852
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:37,398
So you eat and sleep in the same place.

853
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:39,275
EAT AND SLEEP IN THE SAME PLACE?

854
00:38:39,942 --> 00:38:41,485
RIGHT NEXT TO THE BEDROOM

855
00:38:42,361 --> 00:38:43,612
IS A KITCHEN?

856
00:38:43,696 --> 00:38:44,905
So for the kitchen…

857
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:47,491
I think we should remove all the walls.

858
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:50,036
So it will warm up the whole area.

859
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:53,080
The smoke going into the innermost part
of the room isn't so bad.

860
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:54,999
It also works as mosquito repellent.

861
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:57,835
NO WALLS

862
00:38:57,918 --> 00:38:59,754
NO CHIMNEY

863
00:39:00,254 --> 00:39:02,381
WHEN YOU OPEN THE WINDOWS,

864
00:39:02,465 --> 00:39:05,134
YOU CAN VENTILATE

865
00:39:05,885 --> 00:39:08,846
We can cook here.
Then we can serve them breakfast.

866
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:10,931
And we can sleep here.

867
00:39:11,557 --> 00:39:13,267
It has all the daily necessities.

868
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:15,895
DAILY NECESSITIES
ARE IN THE EQUIPMENT BOXES

869
00:39:15,978 --> 00:39:16,812
Goodness.

870
00:39:16,896 --> 00:39:18,397
You only see these in a hotel.

871
00:39:18,481 --> 00:39:19,357
Slippers.

872
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,025
KIAN'S B&B SLIPPERS

873
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:24,236
I want them.

874
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:25,654
KIAN'S B&B

875
00:39:25,738 --> 00:39:26,947
TAKING A TOUR OUTSIDE

876
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:28,824
If you come this way… Here it is.

877
00:39:28,908 --> 00:39:29,950
The water park.

878
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:31,786
THE WATER PARK?

879
00:39:32,453 --> 00:39:39,460
ANNEX'S FEATURE 1
WATERSLIDE

880
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:42,880
We'll make a waterslide.

881
00:39:42,963 --> 00:39:44,924
But the water has to flow.
That's the whole point.

882
00:39:45,466 --> 00:39:48,094
We can swim in the water
flowing from the slide.

883
00:39:48,177 --> 00:39:50,012
We also have to wash clothes here.

884
00:39:55,976 --> 00:39:57,144
And here,

885
00:39:57,228 --> 00:39:58,687
we'll enjoy the water park.

886
00:39:58,771 --> 00:40:00,564
We can wash our clothes here.

887
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:02,942
With this water, we'll brush our teeth
and wash our faces.

888
00:40:03,025 --> 00:40:04,276
We can even wash blankets here.

889
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,528
We can play in the water.

890
00:40:06,195 --> 00:40:07,571
This actually cost a lot.

891
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:08,572
SPEECHLESS

892
00:40:08,656 --> 00:40:09,907
We can wash the blankets here.

893
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:14,495
You can't just use the same water
to wash your hair and brush your teeth.

894
00:40:14,578 --> 00:40:16,038
But you can do that at Kian's B&B.

895
00:40:16,163 --> 00:40:17,998
POSSIBLE AT KIAN'S B&B

896
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:19,417
How do we go up to the gym?

897
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:20,543
The other side.

898
00:40:20,626 --> 00:40:22,461
-There's a path here.
-Right.

899
00:40:22,545 --> 00:40:24,213
-We can walk up.
-Is this a walking trail?

900
00:40:24,296 --> 00:40:25,506
Yes, that's right.

901
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:26,799
-It's private.
-It's important.

902
00:40:26,882 --> 00:40:28,509
How far can it go with privacy?

903
00:40:29,635 --> 00:40:30,970
Look over here.

904
00:40:32,471 --> 00:40:34,974
We worried your muscles would atrophy.

905
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:37,226
I'm sure some people will work out here.

906
00:40:37,309 --> 00:40:38,477
ANNEX'S FEATURE 2
MOUNTAIN GYM

907
00:40:40,146 --> 00:40:41,981
You have to punch it softly.
It might break.

908
00:40:42,064 --> 00:40:43,149
-Okay.
-Punch it softly.

909
00:40:43,232 --> 00:40:45,067
-If you punch it hard…
-You can work out here.

910
00:40:45,151 --> 00:40:46,527
It will break if you hit it hard.

911
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:48,446
These dumbbells look quite old.

912
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:51,240
How can we even use these?

913
00:40:51,323 --> 00:40:52,867
Was this already here?

914
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:54,076
No, we just installed it.

915
00:40:54,618 --> 00:40:56,662
-Then why does it look…
-It's new.

916
00:40:56,745 --> 00:40:59,498
I know you can't believe it.
But all of these were newly installed.

917
00:40:59,582 --> 00:41:00,416
Oh, right.

918
00:41:00,499 --> 00:41:02,501
This is the highlight.

919
00:41:02,585 --> 00:41:04,545
-You have another one?
-Yes.

920
00:41:04,628 --> 00:41:07,256
It's called Ulleungdo Starfield Library.

921
00:41:07,339 --> 00:41:08,841
-For tea?
-Is this where we have tea?

922
00:41:08,924 --> 00:41:09,842
Yes.

923
00:41:09,925 --> 00:41:13,012
These days, they say Gen Z
only like sitting on stairs.

924
00:41:13,095 --> 00:41:16,140
ANNEX'S FEATURE 3
ULLEUNGDO STARFIELD LIBRARY

925
00:41:16,223 --> 00:41:18,893
They all seemed to face one direction.

926
00:41:18,976 --> 00:41:20,186
Like in the Starfield Library.

927
00:41:20,269 --> 00:41:21,562
They can have dinner here.

928
00:41:21,645 --> 00:41:23,606
What's important is
that they can see the sunset

929
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:25,107
and the ocean from here.

930
00:41:27,026 --> 00:41:29,069
The view's amazing.

931
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:31,238
You can sit here and eat.

932
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:32,656
You can have coffee too.

933
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:33,991
"What have you been up to?"

934
00:41:34,074 --> 00:41:35,576
"What's your biggest concern?"

935
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:37,203
While gazing at this vast ocean…

936
00:41:37,286 --> 00:41:39,121
-We can have a heart-to-heart.
-Right.

937
00:41:39,205 --> 00:41:40,664
THE SPOT FOR INTERROGATIONS

938
00:41:40,748 --> 00:41:42,124
Well, this…

939
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:44,084
This is nice.

940
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:46,212
MEANWHILE

941
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:51,175
AFTER ENDURING THE GLOOMY WEATHER

942
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:52,843
Ulleungdo is big.

943
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:54,053
THE FIRST GUESTS ARRIVE

944
00:41:54,136 --> 00:41:57,223
BONGNAE WATERFALL

945
00:41:57,306 --> 00:41:58,140
What?

946
00:41:58,807 --> 00:42:00,392
These are red velvet mites.

947
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:03,270
Let me call them.

948
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:05,689
It's all mixed.

949
00:42:05,773 --> 00:42:07,525
It's mixed in the grass.
Can't see anything.

950
00:42:08,651 --> 00:42:09,693
You got a call?

951
00:42:09,777 --> 00:42:10,945
The guests must be here.

952
00:42:11,737 --> 00:42:13,656
EVERYONE'S NERVOUS

953
00:42:14,949 --> 00:42:16,075
-Hello.
-Hello.

954
00:42:16,158 --> 00:42:17,451
-Yes.
-Yes, hello.

955
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:20,329
We are the guests who are staying tonight.

956
00:42:20,412 --> 00:42:21,997
Oh, hello.

957
00:42:22,081 --> 00:42:24,083
-There are two of us.
-Right.

958
00:42:24,166 --> 00:42:25,626
I haven't received the address yet.

959
00:42:25,709 --> 00:42:27,211
The address here…

960
00:42:27,294 --> 00:42:28,629
Ye-eun, can you find the address?

961
00:42:28,712 --> 00:42:29,547
EMERGENCY MEETING

962
00:42:29,713 --> 00:42:31,382
-I didn't bring my phone.
-One second.

963
00:42:32,091 --> 00:42:33,008
Okay.

964
00:42:34,677 --> 00:42:36,762
Current location.
Why is the reception so bad?

965
00:42:36,845 --> 00:42:38,013
What's our current location?

966
00:42:38,097 --> 00:42:39,848
We're in the mountains,
so reception's bad.

967
00:42:39,932 --> 00:42:41,600
-Sure, take your time.
-You set it…

968
00:42:41,684 --> 00:42:42,726
You set it like this.

969
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:44,562
Here…

970
00:42:45,646 --> 00:42:46,981
The location…

971
00:42:50,693 --> 00:42:52,152
They should come here.

972
00:42:53,445 --> 00:42:54,488
I'll do it!

973
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:56,198
All right.

974
00:42:56,282 --> 00:42:57,908
Look. This location.

975
00:42:58,867 --> 00:43:02,371
Ulleung… I see.
We're in Gyeongsangbuk-do.

976
00:43:02,454 --> 00:43:04,582
Seo-myeon, Ulleung-gun,
Gyeongsangbuk-do.

977
00:43:04,665 --> 00:43:05,874
Namyang-ri.

978
00:43:05,958 --> 00:43:07,001
"Namyang-ri."

979
00:43:07,084 --> 00:43:08,586
-Mountains.
-"Mountains."

980
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:15,676
-How long will it take you to get here?
-We can get there in about an hour or so.

981
00:43:15,759 --> 00:43:17,219
-Okay.
-We can quickly get groceries.

982
00:43:19,221 --> 00:43:20,306
So this is how it works.

983
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:21,807
Shall we get groceries?

984
00:43:21,890 --> 00:43:22,891
Sure, let's do that.

985
00:43:23,142 --> 00:43:25,561
TO DO LIST
GET GROCERIES AND RETURN WITHIN 1 HOUR

986
00:43:25,644 --> 00:43:26,478
We have to be quick.

987
00:43:28,022 --> 00:43:29,106
We have to ride backwards?

988
00:43:29,189 --> 00:43:30,232
We have to go backwards.

989
00:43:35,487 --> 00:43:37,906
I couldn't even imagine this.
How shocking.

990
00:43:38,782 --> 00:43:41,994
This is nature therapy right here.
Nature therapy in Ulleungdo.

991
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:44,747
What a killer view.

992
00:43:45,414 --> 00:43:46,915
It's so killer that it might kill me.

993
00:43:50,544 --> 00:43:52,671
-We should get meat.
-For meat…

994
00:43:52,755 --> 00:43:53,756
Let's get a lot of meat.

995
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:56,175
How many kilograms of meat
do we have to buy?

996
00:43:57,009 --> 00:43:58,010
Well, not that much.

997
00:43:58,093 --> 00:43:58,927
You know why?

998
00:43:59,011 --> 00:44:01,096
-One portion is 200g of meat.
-Right.

999
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:03,474
-It's not a lot.
-It isn't enough.

1000
00:44:03,557 --> 00:44:07,102
Let's say when we eat one meal,
we eat about three portions.

1001
00:44:07,186 --> 00:44:10,564
That's 600g.
If 10 people eat, we need 6kg of meat.

1002
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:12,816
We need a lot of meat
because there are many people.

1003
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:14,568
-Shall we get 10kg first?
-Yes, 10kg.

1004
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:17,071
Here it is. Hanaro Mart.

1005
00:44:17,154 --> 00:44:18,364
Hello.

1006
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:20,199
Here, pork belly.

1007
00:44:20,282 --> 00:44:21,116
Here it is.

1008
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,994
That's ten of these
if we want to get 10kg.

1009
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:27,206
-That's too much.
-Isn't it too much?

1010
00:44:27,289 --> 00:44:29,124
-Let's just get four then.
-Just four packs?

1011
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:31,251
-Maybe six packs?
-Okay, six packs.

1012
00:44:34,296 --> 00:44:35,422
Green onion.

1013
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:37,966
One should be enough, right?

1014
00:44:38,050 --> 00:44:38,884
Kimchi.

1015
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:40,761
We need a pack of kimchi.

1016
00:44:40,844 --> 00:44:41,679
-Just one bag?
-Yes.

1017
00:44:41,762 --> 00:44:43,347
-Rice from Yeoju.
-This one?

1018
00:44:43,430 --> 00:44:45,849
Why are you buying so much?
Isn't it too big?

1019
00:44:45,933 --> 00:44:47,267
We can take the leftovers home.

1020
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:48,227
Okay.

1021
00:44:48,310 --> 00:44:50,270
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

1022
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:52,106
-Thank you. Is it mine?
-Wait.

1023
00:44:54,274 --> 00:44:55,192
They must be here.

1024
00:44:56,318 --> 00:44:57,319
Hello.

1025
00:44:57,403 --> 00:45:00,322
Hi, we are the guests
who called you earlier.

1026
00:45:00,406 --> 00:45:02,449
I think we will get there
later than we thought.

1027
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:03,534
Okay.

1028
00:45:03,617 --> 00:45:05,494
Have you had dinner?

1029
00:45:05,577 --> 00:45:08,080
No. If we need to buy something,
we'll drop by the supermarket.

1030
00:45:08,163 --> 00:45:11,417
If that's the case,
we'll make dinner for you.

1031
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:12,334
Oh, okay.

1032
00:45:12,418 --> 00:45:14,878
From tomorrow onwards,

1033
00:45:14,962 --> 00:45:16,171
we'll only serve breakfast.

1034
00:45:16,255 --> 00:45:17,131
-I see.
-Yes.

1035
00:45:17,214 --> 00:45:19,341
You can get your own food
for the rest of the day.

1036
00:45:19,425 --> 00:45:20,259
Okay.

1037
00:45:20,342 --> 00:45:22,302
Let's have dinner together for tonight.

1038
00:45:22,386 --> 00:45:24,471
-Okay. Thank you.
-Sure.

1039
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:26,515
Did I sound cold?

1040
00:45:26,598 --> 00:45:28,225
No, you were very sweet.

1041
00:45:29,143 --> 00:45:30,519
What else do we need?

1042
00:45:30,602 --> 00:45:31,520
Meal trays.

1043
00:45:31,603 --> 00:45:33,439
HEADING TO BUY MEAL TRAYS

1044
00:45:33,522 --> 00:45:34,940
Here they are.

1045
00:45:35,023 --> 00:45:37,151
Here are the trays.
We can serve breakfast with these.

1046
00:45:37,234 --> 00:45:38,944
How about ten of those?

1047
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:42,156
That's eight, nine.
We have exactly ten trays.

1048
00:45:43,031 --> 00:45:44,575
They're quite heavy.

1049
00:45:44,658 --> 00:45:46,702
How would you know? I'm carrying them.

1050
00:45:46,785 --> 00:45:48,454
When I held them,
they were so heavy.

1051
00:45:48,537 --> 00:45:49,788
Okay.

1052
00:45:51,915 --> 00:45:53,167
We didn't get cooking oil.

1053
00:45:55,377 --> 00:45:56,920
We're missing cooking oil.

1054
00:45:58,130 --> 00:46:00,632
WHAT DO WE DO?

1055
00:46:01,216 --> 00:46:02,718
Can't you ask the guests to get it?

1056
00:46:03,469 --> 00:46:05,679
-Let's ask the guests.
-Yes, let's ask them.

1057
00:46:06,221 --> 00:46:07,055
The guests?

1058
00:46:07,139 --> 00:46:07,973
EMBARRASSED

1059
00:46:08,056 --> 00:46:08,891
All right.

1060
00:46:15,397 --> 00:46:16,815
-Hello.
-Hi.

1061
00:46:16,899 --> 00:46:18,567
-I'm sorry to trouble you.
-Yes?

1062
00:46:18,650 --> 00:46:19,610
Could you…

1063
00:46:19,693 --> 00:46:21,653
Are you still in the town center?

1064
00:46:21,737 --> 00:46:23,030
We're in transit right now.

1065
00:46:23,113 --> 00:46:26,325
-If you can find a convenience store…
-Right.

1066
00:46:26,408 --> 00:46:28,243
Can you get
two big bottles of cooking oil?

1067
00:46:28,327 --> 00:46:29,995
-Just one.
-Which one? Cooking oil?

1068
00:46:30,078 --> 00:46:32,873
-A bottle of cooking oil, please.
-Sure, okay.

1069
00:46:32,956 --> 00:46:34,041
Thank you so much, Boss.

1070
00:46:34,124 --> 00:46:36,001
-You're welcome. I'll get it.
-Thank you.

1071
00:46:36,877 --> 00:46:38,629
Why did I call him Boss?
I'm the boss here.

1072
00:46:38,712 --> 00:46:39,838
Let's get going.

1073
00:46:39,922 --> 00:46:41,465
Sure. Let's make it quick and go.

1074
00:46:43,342 --> 00:46:44,718
Thank you, sir.

1075
00:46:44,801 --> 00:46:46,595
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

1076
00:46:47,721 --> 00:46:50,682
ALREADY TIRED BEFORE OPENING KIAN'S B&B

1077
00:46:50,766 --> 00:46:52,935
-Should I carry them?
-Everyone take one.

1078
00:46:54,394 --> 00:46:55,854
You should take them
one at a time.

1079
00:46:57,022 --> 00:46:59,107
-They won't spill, right?
-No, let's go.

1080
00:47:00,609 --> 00:47:02,361
We have designated seats now.

1081
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:04,655
My goodness.

1082
00:47:05,364 --> 00:47:06,198
TIRED

1083
00:47:06,281 --> 00:47:07,157
I'm all sleepy now.

1084
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:09,117
SPOTTED A TAXI

1085
00:47:09,201 --> 00:47:10,077
It's a taxi.

1086
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:11,203
Aren't they the guests?

1087
00:47:16,375 --> 00:47:17,501
They must be the guests.

1088
00:47:17,584 --> 00:47:18,502
Oh dear.

1089
00:47:19,419 --> 00:47:20,712
What do we do then?

1090
00:47:23,715 --> 00:47:25,300
-They're the guests.
-Hello.

1091
00:47:25,384 --> 00:47:27,052
THE FIRST GUESTS HAVE ARRIVED

1092
00:47:27,135 --> 00:47:29,054
-Goodness, the guests are here.
-Goodness.

1093
00:47:29,137 --> 00:47:30,806
-Gosh.
-Hello.

1094
00:47:30,889 --> 00:47:31,723
Hello.

1095
00:47:31,807 --> 00:47:32,641
WHAT?

1096
00:47:32,724 --> 00:47:34,309
-You can pass me the cooking oil.
-Here.

1097
00:47:34,393 --> 00:47:35,227
-Thank you.
-Hello.

1098
00:47:35,310 --> 00:47:37,020
-I'll wire you the money.
-Hello.

1099
00:47:37,646 --> 00:47:39,690
-Your luggage.
-Right, here.

1100
00:47:39,773 --> 00:47:41,650
Why do you have so much?

1101
00:47:41,733 --> 00:47:44,027
We just happened to pack a lot.

1102
00:47:44,111 --> 00:47:46,655
We have to get there by this monorail.

1103
00:47:46,738 --> 00:47:47,990
-Really?
-Yes.

1104
00:47:50,242 --> 00:47:52,828
STANDING WITHOUT HELPING

1105
00:47:54,288 --> 00:47:55,289
Oh, my.

1106
00:47:55,998 --> 00:47:57,291
-Nice to meet you.
-That's a lot.

1107
00:47:57,374 --> 00:47:58,500
Thank you for coming.

1108
00:47:58,584 --> 00:47:59,751
A BELATED GREETING

1109
00:47:59,835 --> 00:48:01,545
-You are the first guests.
-Right.

1110
00:48:01,628 --> 00:48:03,463
-I'm honored.
-Oh, nice.

1111
00:48:03,547 --> 00:48:04,923
-College students?
-Yes.

1112
00:48:05,007 --> 00:48:05,841
We're 21.

1113
00:48:05,924 --> 00:48:07,009
CHOI SUNG-HO, AGE 21

1114
00:48:07,092 --> 00:48:08,468
-When were you born then?
-In 2004.

1115
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:09,428
CHO SEONG-EUN, AGE 21

1116
00:48:09,511 --> 00:48:11,638
You look like you'd be good at studying.

1117
00:48:12,764 --> 00:48:14,141
-Seoul National University?
-No.

1118
00:48:14,224 --> 00:48:15,726
-Korea University or Yonsei?
-No.

1119
00:48:15,809 --> 00:48:17,019
You have to go farther down.

1120
00:48:17,102 --> 00:48:18,478
-It's not in Seoul.
-KAIST?

1121
00:48:18,562 --> 00:48:19,646
-Yes.
-Yes.

1122
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:21,356
What? Really?

1123
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:23,442
-For real?
-I could tell they're good at studying.

1124
00:48:23,525 --> 00:48:25,235
-Studying…
-They're KAIST students.

1125
00:48:25,319 --> 00:48:26,153
Well…

1126
00:48:26,737 --> 00:48:29,072
We'll get down first
and send the monorail up.

1127
00:48:29,156 --> 00:48:30,949
-Okay.
-It takes…

1128
00:48:31,033 --> 00:48:33,493
about 15 minutes for one round trip.

1129
00:48:33,577 --> 00:48:34,411
Then…

1130
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:36,204
Could you wait here a bit?

1131
00:48:36,288 --> 00:48:37,998
-There's no path down.
-Please wait here.

1132
00:48:38,081 --> 00:48:39,750
Okay.

1133
00:48:40,626 --> 00:48:41,793
They're cute.

1134
00:48:41,877 --> 00:48:43,837
I didn't expect this at all.

1135
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:44,755
Is this for real?

1136
00:48:46,131 --> 00:48:47,341
Vroom vroom.

1137
00:48:47,424 --> 00:48:49,384
EXCITED TO WELCOME THE FIRST GUESTS

1138
00:48:49,468 --> 00:48:50,344
I mean…

1139
00:48:50,427 --> 00:48:53,013
I'm not sure if I should say this.
But they look so gentle.

1140
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:59,227
This is the worst bit.

1141
00:48:59,311 --> 00:49:00,479
What is that?

1142
00:49:01,813 --> 00:49:03,148
Is this for real?

1143
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:04,858
Is he really a BTS member?

1144
00:49:04,941 --> 00:49:06,943
-That's Jin.
-Right, it's Jin.

1145
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:10,155
What? He is Jin.

1146
00:49:10,238 --> 00:49:11,657
IT'S REALLY JIN!

1147
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:13,784
He's the most famous person
I've met in my life.

1148
00:49:13,867 --> 00:49:14,701
I know.

1149
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:16,203
Gosh, BTS?

1150
00:49:16,286 --> 00:49:17,913
-Who would believe this?
-I know.

1151
00:49:18,497 --> 00:49:20,290
-Let's clean up first.
-Let's clean.

1152
00:49:20,374 --> 00:49:22,084
Goodness, so hectic.

1153
00:49:24,753 --> 00:49:27,172
You can just wet it with water.
It's brand new anyway.

1154
00:49:34,054 --> 00:49:35,931
-Kian.
-Have you mopped before in the army?

1155
00:49:36,014 --> 00:49:36,973
-Kian.
-Yes?

1156
00:49:37,057 --> 00:49:38,433
You should wring it out more.

1157
00:49:38,517 --> 00:49:40,018
This is how I usually clean it.

1158
00:49:40,102 --> 00:49:42,896
No! It will get wet then! Boss!

1159
00:49:42,979 --> 00:49:44,606
How should I put this?

1160
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:46,149
-I like it moist.
-No.

1161
00:49:46,233 --> 00:49:47,818
The guests won't like it.

1162
00:49:50,696 --> 00:49:52,739
You don't really need to mop in the army
these days.

1163
00:49:52,823 --> 00:49:54,783
-Then, who cleans the rooms?
-We sleep on beds.

1164
00:49:54,866 --> 00:49:56,118
-You do?
-Yes.

1165
00:49:56,201 --> 00:49:57,577
Let's do this.

1166
00:49:58,995 --> 00:49:59,913
Let's do it.

1167
00:50:07,504 --> 00:50:10,006
This place is so big.

1168
00:50:21,977 --> 00:50:22,936
Hey, it's raining.

1169
00:50:23,603 --> 00:50:24,730
Is it raining a lot?

1170
00:50:24,813 --> 00:50:26,148
It's starting to drizzle.

1171
00:50:26,231 --> 00:50:27,649
The college guys…

1172
00:50:28,817 --> 00:50:29,901
They're coming back, right?

1173
00:50:30,569 --> 00:50:31,987
We'll be able to ride down, right?

1174
00:50:33,029 --> 00:50:34,281
I think it's coming up.

1175
00:50:35,323 --> 00:50:37,075
IT RETURNS
AFTER A 15-MINUTE ROUND TRIP

1176
00:50:37,159 --> 00:50:38,368
What?

1177
00:50:38,452 --> 00:50:40,829
I should've talked longer
on the phone with my dad.

1178
00:50:41,413 --> 00:50:44,040
ON THEIR WAY TO KIAN'S B&B

1179
00:50:44,124 --> 00:50:45,208
Wait a minute.

1180
00:50:45,917 --> 00:50:47,169
-Is this for real?
-Hold on.

1181
00:50:47,252 --> 00:50:48,754
-Wait.
-This is too scary.

1182
00:50:48,837 --> 00:50:51,548
-Is this even right?
-All of a sudden, it's…

1183
00:50:51,631 --> 00:50:54,885
I'm losing my mind right now.
It doesn't feel real.

1184
00:50:54,968 --> 00:50:57,012
It feels like we might see tigers here.

1185
00:50:57,971 --> 00:51:00,265
I see ants on your back.

1186
00:51:00,348 --> 00:51:02,601
-You mean wood ants?
-Japanese queenless ants.

1187
00:51:02,684 --> 00:51:05,312
Pristomyrmex punctatus.

1188
00:51:05,395 --> 00:51:06,646
That's the scientific name.

1189
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:09,775
They are here.

1190
00:51:09,858 --> 00:51:10,776
Are the guests here?

1191
00:51:10,859 --> 00:51:11,693
Are they here?

1192
00:51:11,777 --> 00:51:12,903
FIRST CHECK-IN

1193
00:51:12,986 --> 00:51:13,904
-Hello.
-Goodness.

1194
00:51:14,571 --> 00:51:17,741
How did you even build your B&B here?

1195
00:51:17,824 --> 00:51:19,034
Hello.

1196
00:51:19,826 --> 00:51:21,286
Come on in.

1197
00:51:21,369 --> 00:51:22,829
Okay.

1198
00:51:22,913 --> 00:51:24,915
-You can relax here.
-Thank you.

1199
00:51:24,998 --> 00:51:27,417
The exterior made me think,
"Is it a deserted house?"

1200
00:51:27,501 --> 00:51:28,752
That's what I thought.

1201
00:51:29,753 --> 00:51:31,671
You can pick whatever spot you want.

1202
00:51:31,755 --> 00:51:33,381
Brace yourself before you see it.

1203
00:51:33,465 --> 00:51:35,467
Take whichever spot you want.

1204
00:51:35,967 --> 00:51:37,260
Thank you.

1205
00:51:37,344 --> 00:51:39,513
-It's like the army.
-Right, it's exactly like that.

1206
00:51:40,806 --> 00:51:42,474
-It's like a preview…
-Right, a preview.

1207
00:51:42,557 --> 00:51:44,810
They want us to experience it
before we join the army.

1208
00:51:47,145 --> 00:51:49,022
-You can pick any spot.
-Yes.

1209
00:51:49,105 --> 00:51:50,190
Okay, goodness.

1210
00:51:50,273 --> 00:51:51,983
TOO SHOCKED TO DO ANYTHING

1211
00:51:52,067 --> 00:51:54,736
Let me give you one nice tip.

1212
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:55,695
Okay.

1213
00:51:55,779 --> 00:51:57,823
-I'm sure there will be mosquitoes.
-Right.

1214
00:51:57,906 --> 00:51:59,533
But by lighting up the fireplace,

1215
00:51:59,616 --> 00:52:02,285
-that will get rid of mosquitoes.
-Right.

1216
00:52:02,369 --> 00:52:04,913
You'll inhale a lot of smoke
if you sleep near the fireplace.

1217
00:52:04,996 --> 00:52:06,456
This guy here…

1218
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:08,500
He used to breed mosquitoes before.

1219
00:52:08,583 --> 00:52:09,709
Breed mosquitoes?

1220
00:52:09,793 --> 00:52:11,419
-Breed mosquitoes?
-Yes.

1221
00:52:11,503 --> 00:52:12,629
Do you major in mosquitoes?

1222
00:52:12,712 --> 00:52:14,589
I wanted to research mosquitoes
in high school.

1223
00:52:14,673 --> 00:52:16,383
So I caught and bred a few.

1224
00:52:16,466 --> 00:52:17,300
I fed them.

1225
00:52:17,384 --> 00:52:18,218
What do they eat?

1226
00:52:18,301 --> 00:52:19,845
When they're about to reproduce,

1227
00:52:19,928 --> 00:52:21,972
I put them on my arm and said,
"Enjoy your meal."

1228
00:52:26,184 --> 00:52:28,311
I have to show them around.

1229
00:52:32,524 --> 00:52:33,733
What are your foot sizes?

1230
00:52:33,817 --> 00:52:34,818
Mine is 270mm.

1231
00:52:34,901 --> 00:52:37,070
-I'm about 270 to 275mm.
-Yours is 270mm? Wear these.

1232
00:52:37,153 --> 00:52:38,321
You can take one pair each.

1233
00:52:38,947 --> 00:52:40,323
-For towels…
-Yes?

1234
00:52:40,407 --> 00:52:42,367
Take one each because we don't have many.

1235
00:52:42,450 --> 00:52:43,285
Okay.

1236
00:52:43,368 --> 00:52:44,953
OWNER'S DUTY
PROVIDE SLIPPERS & TOWELS

1237
00:52:45,036 --> 00:52:46,955
-You can wash and reuse them.
-Thank you.

1238
00:52:47,038 --> 00:52:48,123
Here.

1239
00:52:48,206 --> 00:52:49,541
OWNER'S DUTY
INTRODUCE KIAN'S B&B

1240
00:52:49,624 --> 00:52:50,625
Let me explain.

1241
00:52:50,709 --> 00:52:51,960
Boss, sit down and explain.

1242
00:52:52,043 --> 00:52:53,545
Boss, sit down and explain.

1243
00:52:53,628 --> 00:52:55,547
-Sit down.
-Okay.

1244
00:52:55,630 --> 00:52:56,673
This is…

1245
00:52:57,632 --> 00:52:59,384
Monorail…

1246
00:52:59,467 --> 00:53:01,678
It's all about the monorail
in the first few pages.

1247
00:53:01,761 --> 00:53:06,224
And you can see where to go
and what to do toward the back, sir.

1248
00:53:06,308 --> 00:53:07,976
A RELIABLE EMPLOYEE

1249
00:53:09,477 --> 00:53:12,898
FULLY READ THE MANUAL
BEFORE THE GUESTS CHECKED IN

1250
00:53:23,116 --> 00:53:24,701
THE OWNER SEES IT FOR THE FIRST TIME

1251
00:53:24,784 --> 00:53:25,619
Near here…

1252
00:53:25,702 --> 00:53:27,913
You can see a gym up here.

1253
00:53:28,872 --> 00:53:30,624
These are the Starfield Library steps.

1254
00:53:30,707 --> 00:53:33,418
-Right, those steps…
-They're the big steps people sit on.

1255
00:53:34,753 --> 00:53:36,546
-"Big steps."
-You can sit on the big steps.

1256
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:38,506
-You can chat there.
-Right.

1257
00:53:38,590 --> 00:53:40,425
For lower-body workouts,
climb the mountain.

1258
00:53:40,508 --> 00:53:41,927
Right. If we just climb…

1259
00:53:42,010 --> 00:53:45,055
For laundry, you can wash your clothes
here because we don't have a machine.

1260
00:53:45,138 --> 00:53:45,972
SHOCKED

1261
00:53:46,097 --> 00:53:47,557
-Here.
-All right.

1262
00:53:47,641 --> 00:53:49,142
And this…

1263
00:53:49,976 --> 00:53:50,894
-Thank you.
-Sure.

1264
00:53:50,977 --> 00:53:53,146
You can read this when you need to.

1265
00:53:54,397 --> 00:53:55,649
How thoughtful.

1266
00:53:59,861 --> 00:54:02,405
Can you please explain things properly?

1267
00:54:02,489 --> 00:54:03,990
-Do it for me.
-It's all right.

1268
00:54:06,618 --> 00:54:08,662
Why are you being shy to your guests?

1269
00:54:08,745 --> 00:54:10,664
I haven't done this kind of thing before.

1270
00:54:11,373 --> 00:54:14,292
EMBARRASSED

1271
00:54:14,376 --> 00:54:17,420
You can find out more
about the facility here.

1272
00:54:17,504 --> 00:54:19,005
Let's see how well you can do this.

1273
00:54:20,256 --> 00:54:21,841
This is the mountain gym.

1274
00:54:21,925 --> 00:54:24,344
As you just heard,
this is the Starfield Library.

1275
00:54:24,427 --> 00:54:27,263
Do you plan to do
anything special in Ulleungdo?

1276
00:54:27,347 --> 00:54:28,181
Yes.

1277
00:54:28,264 --> 00:54:30,058
If you don't have any plans,

1278
00:54:30,141 --> 00:54:32,394
you can go fishing,
snorkeling, or diving here.

1279
00:54:32,477 --> 00:54:34,813
You can buy squid
fresh from the sea here.

1280
00:54:34,896 --> 00:54:36,564
Do you like squid?

1281
00:54:36,648 --> 00:54:39,234
Squids from Ulleungdo are famous.

1282
00:54:39,317 --> 00:54:42,278
If you want to get fresh squid,
you can go here.

1283
00:54:42,362 --> 00:54:43,697
That's the end of the briefing.

1284
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:45,407
Let's give him a round of applause.

1285
00:54:47,575 --> 00:54:49,160
Isn't that brochure for us?

1286
00:54:49,244 --> 00:54:50,745
This is for all guests.

1287
00:54:50,829 --> 00:54:52,539
-Really?
-Whenever you need to,

1288
00:54:52,622 --> 00:54:54,874
-you can read it here.
-So we keep it there. All right.

1289
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:57,627
We'll have dinner together
since you're the first guests.

1290
00:54:57,711 --> 00:54:59,295
We'll serve you breakfast tomorrow.

1291
00:54:59,379 --> 00:55:00,714
Will you be having breakfast?

1292
00:55:00,797 --> 00:55:02,007
Do you usually have breakfast?

1293
00:55:02,632 --> 00:55:05,218
It's a bit weird to ask
if they're going to have breakfast.

1294
00:55:05,301 --> 00:55:06,678
We need to get it ready.

1295
00:55:06,761 --> 00:55:08,346
Breakfast should always be ready.

1296
00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:11,016
We have to ask
if there aren't too many guests.

1297
00:55:11,891 --> 00:55:14,853
If you eat a lot tonight,
you might not be hungry the next morning.

1298
00:55:14,936 --> 00:55:15,895
You're right.

1299
00:55:15,979 --> 00:55:18,648
Honestly, we don't really have breakfast.

1300
00:55:18,732 --> 00:55:19,858
Breakfast isn't appetizing.

1301
00:55:19,941 --> 00:55:21,818
People don't eat in the morning.

1302
00:55:21,901 --> 00:55:22,986
No breakfast tomorrow then.

1303
00:55:23,069 --> 00:55:24,279
-All right.
-Okay.

1304
00:55:24,362 --> 00:55:26,364
KIAN'S B&B RULES
MAKE BREAKFAST IF GUESTS WANT IT

1305
00:55:26,448 --> 00:55:30,118
SERVE DINNER TONIGHT
INSTEAD OF BREAKFAST TOMORROW

1306
00:55:30,201 --> 00:55:32,537
Since you're the first guests,
I'll take a photo for you.

1307
00:55:32,620 --> 00:55:33,872
That'll be the backdrop.

1308
00:55:35,790 --> 00:55:37,125
Wow, "Kian's B&B."

1309
00:55:38,209 --> 00:55:40,420
Can I get closer?
The pictures tended to look distant.

1310
00:55:40,503 --> 00:55:42,130
One, two. Get closer.

1311
00:55:42,213 --> 00:55:43,673
One, two, three.

1312
00:55:45,467 --> 00:55:46,301
I love it.

1313
00:55:47,510 --> 00:55:48,803
Are you two classmates?

1314
00:55:48,887 --> 00:55:50,764
Yes. We've been friends since high school.

1315
00:55:50,847 --> 00:55:52,640
We went to the same science high school.

1316
00:55:52,724 --> 00:55:54,100
You must be best friends.

1317
00:55:54,184 --> 00:55:55,060
Very much so.

1318
00:55:55,143 --> 00:55:56,561
That's cool.

1319
00:55:57,145 --> 00:55:59,731
I think we should start cooking now.

1320
00:55:59,814 --> 00:56:01,775
Here. We should use…

1321
00:56:01,858 --> 00:56:03,902
UNEASY

1322
00:56:06,488 --> 00:56:08,406
Make yourselves at home. Don't mind us.

1323
00:56:08,490 --> 00:56:09,908
Okay.

1324
00:56:09,991 --> 00:56:11,576
PHONE RINGING

1325
00:56:11,659 --> 00:56:13,369
I guess this was an uncomfortable layout.

1326
00:56:15,205 --> 00:56:16,831
WHO COULD IT BE?

1327
00:56:16,915 --> 00:56:17,874
Hello.

1328
00:56:17,957 --> 00:56:20,168
Hello. I'm calling to check in today.

1329
00:56:20,251 --> 00:56:21,086
Right.

1330
00:56:21,169 --> 00:56:22,295
I think we have more guests.

1331
00:56:22,378 --> 00:56:23,505
We have more guests?

1332
00:56:23,588 --> 00:56:25,298
I'm calling to check in today.

1333
00:56:25,381 --> 00:56:26,466
How many is in your group?

1334
00:56:27,175 --> 00:56:28,510
-Just me.
-Just you.

1335
00:56:28,593 --> 00:56:30,762
-One person.
-I'll send you the address.

1336
00:56:30,845 --> 00:56:32,931
-You'll find a monorail there.
-Right.

1337
00:56:33,014 --> 00:56:34,390
You can take that monorail down.

1338
00:56:34,474 --> 00:56:35,308
-Okay.
-All right.

1339
00:56:35,391 --> 00:56:36,976
How long will it take you?

1340
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:39,395
I'll only know
when you send me the address.

1341
00:56:39,479 --> 00:56:41,439
You are right.

1342
00:56:41,523 --> 00:56:44,275
That was a very sharp point you made.

1343
00:56:45,026 --> 00:56:47,320
-I'll text you the address.
-All right.

1344
00:56:47,445 --> 00:56:48,863
FIRST DAY GUESTS
3 PEOPLE

1345
00:56:50,490 --> 00:56:52,742
GETTING ANOTHER CALL

1346
00:56:52,826 --> 00:56:54,285
Who is it now? Hello.

1347
00:56:54,369 --> 00:56:55,954
-Hello.
-Hi.

1348
00:56:56,037 --> 00:56:57,038
I'm staying at your B&B.

1349
00:56:57,122 --> 00:56:59,249
-I haven't received the address yet.
-Right.

1350
00:56:59,332 --> 00:57:00,875
-For how many?
-We're in trouble.

1351
00:57:00,959 --> 00:57:01,876
-Just me.
-One person?

1352
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:03,002
-Yes.
-All right.

1353
00:57:04,546 --> 00:57:07,340
I'm suddenly happy,
because a lot of people are coming.

1354
00:57:07,423 --> 00:57:08,925
It feels like a full house.

1355
00:57:09,008 --> 00:57:10,343
FIRST DAY GUESTS
4 PEOPLE

1356
00:57:10,426 --> 00:57:12,595
-Shall we make rice now?
-Let's cook.

1357
00:57:12,679 --> 00:57:13,596
PREPARING FOR DINNER

1358
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:15,598
Do we have space in the fridge for these?

1359
00:57:17,559 --> 00:57:19,644
THE GUESTS ARE HELPING NOW

1360
00:57:23,606 --> 00:57:25,984
You can make rice here.
And we can grill the meat here.

1361
00:57:26,985 --> 00:57:28,278
Let's flip the lid.

1362
00:57:28,361 --> 00:57:29,696
Shall we start a fire here?

1363
00:57:29,779 --> 00:57:31,030
That would be too strong.

1364
00:57:31,114 --> 00:57:32,115
-Then, here?
-Yeah.

1365
00:57:32,198 --> 00:57:33,992
Let's fire it up here and grill.

1366
00:57:34,075 --> 00:57:36,077
But that would take too long
to heat this up.

1367
00:57:36,161 --> 00:57:37,996
-I don't think it will work.
-It will work.

1368
00:57:38,079 --> 00:57:39,789
Ask the KAIST students
to see if it'd work.

1369
00:57:39,873 --> 00:57:41,374
-Sorry?
-Look at this.

1370
00:57:41,458 --> 00:57:44,461
If we start a fire here,
will the pork belly cook?

1371
00:57:45,044 --> 00:57:48,256
Shouldn't you light the fireplace
so the smoke exits the chimney?

1372
00:57:48,339 --> 00:57:49,466
There is no chimney.

1373
00:57:50,508 --> 00:57:52,594
Exactly. Won't it come out this way?

1374
00:57:52,677 --> 00:57:53,845
The smoke will come to us.

1375
00:57:53,928 --> 00:57:54,971
There is no chimney?

1376
00:57:55,054 --> 00:57:56,097
THERE ARE WINDOWS

1377
00:57:56,181 --> 00:57:57,515
Let's light these up first.

1378
00:57:59,225 --> 00:58:00,935
Goodness, it's all wet.

1379
00:58:03,563 --> 00:58:05,148
What is this? Darn.

1380
00:58:11,571 --> 00:58:12,655
What are you doing?

1381
00:58:14,324 --> 00:58:15,867
Maybe that torch isn't working.

1382
00:58:15,950 --> 00:58:17,452
-What's wrong with this?
-Let me try.

1383
00:58:17,535 --> 00:58:18,620
Hold on a second.

1384
00:58:21,206 --> 00:58:22,790
KIAN'S BIZARRE B&B

1385
00:58:22,874 --> 00:58:24,626
Gosh, I can't open my eyes!

1386
00:58:24,709 --> 00:58:26,294
You idiot!

1387
00:58:26,377 --> 00:58:27,212
Are you okay?

1388
00:58:29,339 --> 00:58:30,507
The weather is amazing.

1389
00:58:30,590 --> 00:58:31,716
We have to get to the barge.

1390
00:58:31,799 --> 00:58:32,842
We'll go now for sure.

1391
00:58:32,926 --> 00:58:33,927
We're finally here.

1392
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:35,220
This is crazy!

1393
00:58:35,303 --> 00:58:36,262
This is so moving.

1394
00:58:36,346 --> 00:58:37,388
This is amazing!

1395
00:58:37,472 --> 00:58:38,431
The day's finally here!

1396
00:58:38,515 --> 00:58:39,974
I can't believe how beautiful it is.

1397
00:58:40,058 --> 00:58:41,559
It's super well-made.

1398
00:58:41,643 --> 00:58:43,019
It's better than I thought.

1399
00:58:43,102 --> 00:58:44,103
What is this?

1400
00:58:44,187 --> 00:58:45,355
What's this?

1401
00:58:46,898 --> 00:58:48,608
How can you design it like this?

1402
00:58:48,691 --> 00:58:50,944
I don't want to go inside.

1403
00:58:51,027 --> 00:58:52,654
Which idiot designed it like this?

1404
00:58:52,737 --> 00:58:53,821
Are you bad-mouthing me?

1405
00:58:53,905 --> 00:58:55,406
My gosh! Kian!

1406
00:58:55,490 --> 00:58:56,658
Get me out of here.

1407
00:58:56,741 --> 00:58:57,992
Boss, how do we get down?

1408
00:58:58,076 --> 00:58:59,536
I'm exhausted.

1409
00:58:59,619 --> 00:59:00,787
Nothing's easy in this house.

1410
00:59:00,870 --> 00:59:01,829
Are you crazy?

1411
00:59:01,913 --> 00:59:03,498
Hey, show me some respect!

1412
00:59:03,581 --> 00:59:05,083
No! I'm doomed!

1413
00:59:05,166 --> 00:59:07,752
Please tell me this is a prank.

1414
00:59:07,835 --> 00:59:08,836
Ye-eun, are you crying?

1415
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:10,171
I want to run away.

1416
00:59:10,255 --> 00:59:12,382
He didn't think this through!

1417
00:59:12,465 --> 00:59:14,467
How dare you say that?

1418
01:00:11,608 --> 01:00:13,526
