1
00:00:06,631 --> 00:00:08,758
-Shall we make rice now?
-Let's cook.

2
00:00:08,842 --> 00:00:09,968
Shouldn't we mop the floor?

3
00:00:10,051 --> 00:00:11,219
You can make rice here.

4
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:13,513
And we can grill the meat here.

5
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:15,306
Let's flip the lid.

6
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:16,725
Shall we start a fire here?

7
00:00:16,808 --> 00:00:18,059
That would be too strong.

8
00:00:18,143 --> 00:00:18,977
-Then, here?
-Yeah.

9
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:21,271
Let's fire it up here and grill.

10
00:00:25,316 --> 00:00:26,317
STARTLED

11
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:29,946
Watch out.

12
00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:31,656
I think I just saw something amazing.

13
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:33,992
TERRIFYING FIREPOWER

14
00:00:34,075 --> 00:00:35,994
-Kian, use this.
-What?

15
00:00:36,077 --> 00:00:37,162
We had this?

16
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:40,999
-I got it.
-You got it.

17
00:00:41,958 --> 00:00:42,792
There you go.

18
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:47,172
Wow, it's so strong.

19
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:51,676
LIGHTS THE FIREPLACE
WITH AN EMPTY CAULDRON

20
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:53,720
TO MAKE RICE

21
00:00:53,803 --> 00:00:55,388
AND TO GET RID OF INSECTS

22
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:57,307
PUTS IN A LOT OF WOOD

23
00:01:03,146 --> 00:01:05,648
Why didn't he make
a chimney for the fireplace?

24
00:01:06,983 --> 00:01:10,195
WITHOUT A CHIMNEY,
SMOKE GOES OUT THE WINDOWS

25
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:15,450
My eyes are burning.

26
00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:16,785
Geez, mine hurt too!

27
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:18,244
-I mean…
-It's too strong.

28
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:20,205
Who builds a fireplace without a chimney?

29
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:22,457
I DO

30
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:24,167
We have to clean this right now!

31
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:25,168
It's heating up.

32
00:01:25,794 --> 00:01:27,003
WASHING AFTER HEATING

33
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:28,046
Put it over here.

34
00:01:28,129 --> 00:01:29,297
My eyes are burning.

35
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:33,426
Why is it so heavy?

36
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:35,053
I'll do it.

37
00:01:35,136 --> 00:01:36,346
Wait a minute.

38
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:39,432
We have too much smoke in here.

39
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:40,683
We're sleeping like this?

40
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:41,810
USING THE FAN TO VENTILATE

41
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:46,898
I can't even open my eyes.

42
00:01:46,981 --> 00:01:49,609
Even when we made rockets in high school,

43
00:01:49,692 --> 00:01:52,403
I don't think there was this much smoke.

44
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:54,322
Gosh, I can't open my eyes!

45
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:57,242
You idiot!

46
00:01:57,826 --> 00:01:59,244
Damn it!

47
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:01,496
OVERFLOWING WITH DOPAMINE

48
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:03,373
Your true colors are showing now, Ye-eun.

49
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:04,707
ME TOO

50
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,000
Go outside. I'll do it.

51
00:02:06,584 --> 00:02:07,502
Like this? Okay.

52
00:02:07,585 --> 00:02:08,878
THE CAULDRON IS SET

53
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:15,802
It smells like the countryside though.
It's nice.

54
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:22,225
It would be better
if you stayed over there.

55
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:24,310
Don't mind us.

56
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:25,603
Make yourselves at home.

57
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,441
It's peaceful.

58
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:31,943
What on earth is this?

59
00:02:32,026 --> 00:02:33,361
I can breathe now.

60
00:02:33,444 --> 00:02:35,238
Still, it was only our first day there.

61
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:37,073
We thought we should be like,
"This is fun!"

62
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:38,992
But I think Kian should stay away

63
00:02:39,075 --> 00:02:40,368
from designing houses.

64
00:02:42,745 --> 00:02:43,788
I should make the rice.

65
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:45,498
HOW WILL KIAN'S RICE TASTE?

66
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:55,717
A POT INSIDE THE CAULDRON?

67
00:02:59,178 --> 00:03:00,889
What idiot designed this house?

68
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:03,182
I DID

69
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:07,186
My eyes!

70
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:08,521
-Meal trays.
-Meal trays.

71
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:12,275
PREPARING THE MEAL TRAYS
IN THE MIDST OF CHAOS

72
00:03:16,654 --> 00:03:18,448
-Gosh, the smell.
-Man, I'm…

73
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:20,533
I can't stay in there.

74
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:22,118
ESCAPING AFTER RICE STARTS COOKING

75
00:03:22,201 --> 00:03:23,411
Geez, I'm crying!

76
00:03:25,788 --> 00:03:27,498
Wait, so the rice is cooking.

77
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:29,751
We can grill the pork belly now.

78
00:03:29,834 --> 00:03:31,628
Let's cook it when the guests arrive.

79
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:33,046
Should we do that?

80
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:34,589
Gosh, look at the sky!

81
00:03:35,214 --> 00:03:36,424
-Wow, it's a rainbow!
-Wow.

82
00:03:36,507 --> 00:03:37,926
-Wow.
-That's amazing.

83
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:43,848
It looks like it's from a cartoon.

84
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:45,225
Want me to take your photo?

85
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:46,142
Stand over there.

86
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:47,852
Kian, you're very sentimental.

87
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:49,270
I don't usually do this, but…

88
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:50,688
Say "rainbow."

89
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:52,440
-One, two.
-Rainbow.

90
00:03:53,149 --> 00:03:54,317
That rainbow is amazing.

91
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:56,819
Should we go and unpack our stuff too?

92
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:58,029
We have to go unpack too.

93
00:03:58,112 --> 00:03:58,947
-Sure.
-Okay.

94
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,949
-We haven't been to our rooms yet.
-I see.

95
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:02,450
Let's go unpack and come back.

96
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:06,537
Opening the B&B from the first day
is a lot of work.

97
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:07,956
I'm mad at you, Boss.

98
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:10,208
I'm sorry. This is my first time too.

99
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:14,837
UNPACKING IN THE STAFF'S QUARTERS
WHILE THE RICE COOKS

100
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:18,341
A TOAD?

101
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:20,635
A SMALL STATUE OF THE BUDDHA?

102
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:23,805
A BELL?

103
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:27,141
6:30 P.M.
AT THE MONORAIL

104
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:29,477
-You can put your suitcase in the back.
-Okay.

105
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:34,649
So this is where we get on?

106
00:04:34,732 --> 00:04:36,276
I think so.

107
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:38,444
My goodness.

108
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:39,988
QUICKLY TAKES OFF

109
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:42,031
This is so scary!

110
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:44,701
What is this?

111
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:48,538
THE ONLY WAY TO GET TO KIAN'S B&B

112
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,081
Watch out!

113
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:54,210
My face is all wet from the rain.

114
00:04:56,587 --> 00:04:58,423
Wow, it's so pretty!

115
00:04:58,506 --> 00:05:00,466
But this is too…

116
00:05:03,344 --> 00:05:04,470
It's so pretty though.

117
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:08,308
But how far are we going?

118
00:05:09,183 --> 00:05:10,310
There's a rainbow.

119
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:11,519
-Where?
-Over there.

120
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:14,439
That's amazing.

121
00:05:15,773 --> 00:05:17,358
Are we the first guests?

122
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:19,152
I think they're here.

123
00:05:19,235 --> 00:05:20,737
But none of the staff are here.

124
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:21,696
What do we do?

125
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:23,990
This is crazy.

126
00:05:29,203 --> 00:05:31,331
HESITANT

127
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:32,749
-Hello.
-Hello.

128
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:33,666
Hello.

129
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:36,044
It's really smoky inside.

130
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:38,254
TWO GUESTS CHECK IN
AT A KIAN-LESS KIAN'S B&B

131
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:41,841
The staff left for a moment to unpack.

132
00:05:41,924 --> 00:05:43,301
What did they do inside?

133
00:05:43,384 --> 00:05:44,969
-What did they do?
-They're making rice.

134
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:46,137
-Rice?
-Yes.

135
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:47,847
-But…
-I think it's burning.

136
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:49,390
Can we go in?

137
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:50,933
You can if you're okay with it.

138
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,144
My eyes are burning.

139
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:55,813
I was so shocked.

140
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:59,859
The smoke coming from the cauldron
was beyond imagination.

141
00:05:59,942 --> 00:06:01,736
It was the first time in my life

142
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:03,654
I was unable to open my eyes like that.

143
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:08,117
I'm crying.

144
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:11,162
-Goodness.
-I'm crying.

145
00:06:11,245 --> 00:06:13,581
I think something's gone wrong.

146
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:18,586
PLEASE HELP KIAN'S B&B SUCCEED

147
00:06:24,675 --> 00:06:25,676
What's that?

148
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:27,970
When you rub its back,

149
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:29,847
it'll bring good luck.

150
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:32,600
Good luck's coming in.

151
00:06:32,683 --> 00:06:34,185
I can hear the luck coming in.

152
00:06:34,268 --> 00:06:36,020
CROAK

153
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:37,480
Let's go.

154
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:39,649
I think the guests are here.

155
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:41,150
The staff's coming now.

156
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:43,653
-Hello.
-Hello.

157
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:44,946
THE STAFF RETURNS

158
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:47,115
I think your B&B will go out of business.

159
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:51,786
-Did you put out the fire?
-What?

160
00:06:53,412 --> 00:06:54,372
Hold on. Gosh.

161
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:00,169
ACTIVATING THE VENTILATION SYSTEM

162
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:01,671
That's a great idea.

163
00:07:02,338 --> 00:07:03,840
The fire's really strong.

164
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:12,306
PUTS OUT THE FIRE IN THE FIREPLACE

165
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,145
Well done.

166
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:18,271
Good job.

167
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:19,564
My gosh.

168
00:07:20,356 --> 00:07:22,150
We're suffering so much with a dumb boss.

169
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:23,359
I know.

170
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:24,318
What did you say?

171
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:27,363
-I was expecting Hyori's Bed & Breakfast.
-Really?

172
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:28,948
Over there, it was definitely…

173
00:07:29,031 --> 00:07:30,450
-Me too.
-It's…

174
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:32,326
I came expecting
Hyori's Bed & Breakfast too.

175
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:34,454
They said it was the same director.

176
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:36,247
When we received the guests,

177
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:40,042
I wanted to talk and mingle with them.

178
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:42,920
But things were already hectic for us.

179
00:07:44,922 --> 00:07:47,300
I was in a total state of panic then.

180
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:54,474
DID THE RICE COOK WELL?

181
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:02,523
IT'S JUST WATER AND RICE

182
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:06,277
It did cook a little bit.

183
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,405
What on earth do you mean?
It should be fully cooked.

184
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:10,948
What do you mean "a little bit"?

185
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:11,908
It's half-cooked,

186
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:12,992
like a rare steak.

187
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:14,243
Rice cooked rare.

188
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:15,912
It's just rice soaked in water.

189
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:17,288
This isn't going to work.

190
00:08:17,371 --> 00:08:18,956
Let's just use the portable stove.

191
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:23,211
It'd be nice if we had another one.
With just one…

192
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:26,589
THINKING

193
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:27,798
You're hungry, aren't you?

194
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:30,343
-In that case, sir…
-Yeah?

195
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:32,345
-Let's cook here with the portable stove.
-Okay.

196
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:33,471
And relight the fireplace.

197
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:34,680
-Relight it?
-The cauldron…

198
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:36,098
Let's clean it.

199
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:38,267
-Let's just grill the pork belly on it.
-All right.

200
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:39,602
I'll give it my best.

201
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:41,270
Should I just go and buy some mulhoe?

202
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:42,355
Mulhoe?

203
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:43,898
That would be faster.

204
00:08:43,981 --> 00:08:46,692
Just for tonight since we have no choice.
Just for tonight…

205
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:47,652
No, Ye-eun.

206
00:08:47,735 --> 00:08:48,611
Don't compromise!

207
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:50,488
Hold on.

208
00:08:50,571 --> 00:08:52,573
-Just for tonight. Yeah.
-Just for tonight?

209
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:53,866
-Ye-eun!
-What I mean is…

210
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,535
-People make mistakes.
-Ye-eun!

211
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:57,537
-But we…
-People can make mistakes.

212
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,455
What are you doing, Ye-eun?

213
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:01,290
We can just light the firewood

214
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:03,000
and grill the meat.

215
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:05,586
In that case,
that'll take an hour and a half.

216
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:08,381
I think buying mulhoe would be faster.

217
00:09:08,464 --> 00:09:10,675
COOKING FOOD THEMSELVES
VERSUS BUYING MULHOE

218
00:09:10,758 --> 00:09:12,134
WHAT WILL THE OWNER CHOOSE?

219
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:13,970
No, we shouldn't.

220
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:14,971
We…

221
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,223
We have to serve our guests.

222
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:18,975
KIAN'S PHILOSOPHY
WE MAKE MEALS FOR GUESTS

223
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:19,892
That's right.

224
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:21,852
I'll wash the cauldron then.

225
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:28,693
Gosh, that's cold!

226
00:09:47,878 --> 00:09:50,756
RELIT

227
00:09:55,052 --> 00:09:57,305
SILENCE

228
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:02,768
So, are you liking your stay?

229
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:04,895
They just got here.

230
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:06,397
ARE WE LIKING OUR STAY?

231
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,066
How many days are you staying here?

232
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:11,360
-I'll be here for three days.
-Me too.

233
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:12,361
Both of you?

234
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:13,779
Did you two first meet here?

235
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:14,739
Yes, we just met.

236
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:17,074
-We just met on the monorail.
-Right.

237
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:18,367
Well, in any case,

238
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:20,411
you're here now, so just relax.

239
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:26,542
8:00 P.M.
THE RICE IS COOKED

240
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,669
-Everyone, scoop your rice.
-Come eat.

241
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:29,920
The rice is cooked so well.

242
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:31,130
I know I made it, but…

243
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:33,424
-The rice is…
-Look at it steam.

244
00:10:33,507 --> 00:10:34,759
Go and scoop your rice.

245
00:10:34,842 --> 00:10:35,885
Everyone…

246
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:38,137
-There's no breakfast tomorrow.
-Okay.

247
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,348
-So you have to eat a lot tonight.
-Okay.

248
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:41,891
Even if you're hungry tomorrow…

249
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:43,684
-How come?
-The only B&B with no breakfast.

250
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:46,103
We usually serve it,
but just not for tomorrow.

251
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:48,230
They usually serve it
and not dinner. It switched.

252
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:50,149
We're treating this
as tomorrow's breakfast.

253
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:55,029
FINISHES OILING THE CAULDRON

254
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:56,822
Gosh, it's hot.

255
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:05,498
This might not work.

256
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:20,137
Let me ask for help.

257
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:25,684
-Hey.
-Hi, sir!

258
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:29,021
-Are you having fun?
-Hi, sir!

259
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:32,483
-Are you having fun?
-I'm shooting a show right now.

260
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:33,401
Who's that?

261
00:11:35,152 --> 00:11:37,238
You know cauldrons, right?

262
00:11:37,905 --> 00:11:40,908
-What kind of cauldron?
-Those cast-iron cauldrons.

263
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:43,828
-Is that Paik Jong-won?
-It's Mr. Paik. They're close.

264
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:45,788
-Yeah, I hear his voice.
-But…

265
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:50,084
Isn't calling Mr. Paik
about a burned cauldron a bit much?

266
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:53,212
I've been wiping it for a while,
but I get black residue. What do I do?

267
00:11:53,295 --> 00:11:55,506
With cast iron, you have to use it first.

268
00:11:55,589 --> 00:11:59,176
Whether you fry or boil something,
you have to use it first.

269
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,804
That way, it becomes naturally seasoned.

270
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:04,974
But I keep getting black residue
from the cast iron.

271
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:06,142
You can just eat it.

272
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:07,309
You won't die, kid.

273
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:09,145
You won't get residue once it gets hot.

274
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:10,896
-Really?
-Yeah.

275
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:13,858
-Okay, I got it. Thank you.
-Enjoy your meal. Bye.

276
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:15,901
-Sir.
-Yeah?

277
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:17,194
I just asked Mr. Paik.

278
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:18,112
What did he say?

279
00:12:18,195 --> 00:12:19,488
He said it's okay to eat.

280
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:20,573
PROBLEM SOLVED

281
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:22,032
All right, it's settled.

282
00:12:22,658 --> 00:12:23,534
It's all set.

283
00:12:23,617 --> 00:12:25,536
If being clean is important, use this.

284
00:12:25,619 --> 00:12:26,912
If you're adventurous, use that.

285
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:28,205
He said if we use high heat,

286
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:30,040
we'll get less residue.

287
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:31,959
Okay. I'm looking forward to it.

288
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:34,837
Good luck.

289
00:12:35,796 --> 00:12:36,964
GLARES

290
00:12:37,047 --> 00:12:38,132
What?

291
00:12:38,215 --> 00:12:39,675
What's wrong?

292
00:12:39,758 --> 00:12:40,843
Want me to help?

293
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:42,761
-That would be great.
-You need my help?

294
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:44,054
All right, I'm coming.

295
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:45,431
You should've said so then!

296
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:47,892
It's lonely if you cook by yourself.

297
00:12:48,517 --> 00:12:49,477
It is?

298
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,895
Of course!

299
00:12:50,978 --> 00:12:54,190
Hey, we shouldn't leave the food out here.

300
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:56,025
We're staying here for a while.

301
00:12:58,319 --> 00:12:59,153
MUNCH

302
00:12:59,236 --> 00:13:01,739
-Why are you eating raw green onions?
-Want some?

303
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:03,157
-No.
-It's tasty.

304
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:06,118
It's all set. Pass me the meat.

305
00:13:08,662 --> 00:13:10,164
Sir, the fire has weakened.

306
00:13:10,247 --> 00:13:11,415
Let's stoke it again.

307
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:13,751
We should use the butane torch.

308
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:27,473
Is it working?

309
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:29,975
Mr. Paik was right. It's not black.

310
00:13:30,809 --> 00:13:31,769
THE FRYING PAN TEAM

311
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:33,103
Let me cook it for you first.

312
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:34,146
I'll do it for you.

313
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,814
You can just sit and relax.

314
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:38,442
This works so well. We're cooking faster.

315
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:40,528
Their meat won't cook.
Let's hurry up and eat.

316
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:41,987
You must be starving.

317
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:43,280
The meat's cooking.

318
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:44,990
We're the winners.

319
00:13:48,702 --> 00:13:50,579
It's a complete mess in there.

320
00:13:51,413 --> 00:13:52,414
Look at the smoke.

321
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:54,458
It's like when they cooked the rice.

322
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:57,461
VENTILATION SYSTEM IS ON

323
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:01,590
Are you good at grilling meat?

324
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:04,635
-Not too bad, I'd say.
-Okay.

325
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:07,054
Let's also grill some kimchi
in the middle.

326
00:14:07,137 --> 00:14:08,389
Should we do it or not?

327
00:14:08,472 --> 00:14:10,516
-Let's try this much first.
-This much?

328
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:11,600
Put it in.

329
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:17,565
Green onions.

330
00:14:17,648 --> 00:14:19,108
Why are you putting green onions in?

331
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:20,651
They're delicious when grilled.

332
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:26,323
Let's grill this one too.

333
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:27,741
That's hot!

334
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:29,451
-Cook this.
-Why are you grilling these?

335
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:30,828
Try it. It's delicious.

336
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:32,329
What are you talking about?

337
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:33,622
-Try it.
-Come on!

338
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:35,332
-They eat this in Italy.
-It's all burnt!

339
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:36,250
Put it in.

340
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:38,043
It's all burnt!

341
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:39,336
Put it in. Give it to me.

342
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:42,715
Hey, this is…

343
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:45,509
Let's use the frying pan. Geez.

344
00:14:46,176 --> 00:14:47,553
It looks good though.

345
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:51,390
-Those green onions are raw.
-We should grill them some more.

346
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:54,268
Gosh, it's so hot.

347
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:57,021
Hold on a second.

348
00:14:57,104 --> 00:14:58,314
Take this first.

349
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:00,524
-And the kimchi.
-One more piece of kimchi.

350
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:04,486
We're already eating.

351
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,030
Ye-eun was right.

352
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:08,115
See? I was right.

353
00:15:08,198 --> 00:15:09,575
The frying pan's much better.

354
00:15:09,658 --> 00:15:11,452
-It was easy and enjoyable for us.
-Exactly.

355
00:15:11,535 --> 00:15:13,370
-Eat up.
-Hurry and eat.

356
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:28,260
Is it good?

357
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:30,179
It's so good.

358
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:37,102
-It's delicious.
-I know!

359
00:15:37,978 --> 00:15:39,605
-It's splattering again.
-Is it good?

360
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:40,564
It's delicious.

361
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:42,024
-I know!
-It's so good.

362
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:45,861
VERY PLEASED WITH THEIR FIRST MEAL

363
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,947
-Let me…
-The kimchi is so good.

364
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:50,324
Sir, is this what you wanted
to do for the show?

365
00:15:50,407 --> 00:15:51,700
What I wanted to do?

366
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:53,869
Yeah, I like it.

367
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:55,162
-Then, it's fine.
-Right.

368
00:15:55,245 --> 00:15:57,539
-B&Bs are all about taking some rest.
-Right.

369
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:58,707
So then…

370
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:01,669
you just lie down in your room and relax.

371
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:04,004
But we don't have walls here anyway.

372
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:05,631
TOGETHER AS ONE AT KIAN'S B&B

373
00:16:05,714 --> 00:16:07,132
Well, during your stay,

374
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:09,385
let me know if anything is uncomfortable.

375
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:10,970
This is uncomfortable.

376
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:12,554
-Sir, the smoke…
-Right.

377
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:15,307
That's a lot of smoke. Seriously.

378
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:17,184
-My nose is running.
-It's uncomfortable.

379
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:18,519
-Right.
-It's so uncomfortable.

380
00:16:18,602 --> 00:16:19,770
You want us to sleep there?

381
00:16:19,853 --> 00:16:21,313
I can't believe what I said either.

382
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:24,274
After making this mess,
I'm asking you what's uncomfortable.

383
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:26,694
Seriously, this whole situation
is uncomfortable.

384
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:29,905
Since you're here,
let's all share a drink.

385
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,532
Do we even have any cups?

386
00:16:31,615 --> 00:16:32,700
We don't have cups.

387
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:34,535
Or with the meal trays…

388
00:16:34,618 --> 00:16:36,161
Should we drink from the meal trays?

389
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:37,329
-I don't mind.
-Me neither.

390
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:38,664
Yeah, let's use the meal trays.

391
00:16:39,206 --> 00:16:41,750
I'll serve everyone a drink
since you're all here.

392
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:44,294
Okay, I'll pour your drink.

393
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:45,421
Goodness.

394
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:47,923
-Thank you.
-Enjoy your stay, everyone.

395
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:49,091
MAKGEOLLI BOWLS FOR GUESTS

396
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:50,551
Make yourself at home.

397
00:16:50,634 --> 00:16:51,468
For me…

398
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:52,511
MEAL TRAYS FOR STAFF

399
00:16:52,594 --> 00:16:53,887
That's hilarious.

400
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:55,389
Shouldn't we take a photo?

401
00:16:55,472 --> 00:16:56,849
This will be a fond memory.

402
00:16:56,932 --> 00:17:00,019
Gen Z takes photos of this.
One, two, three.

403
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:02,229
-Nice to meet you all.
-Cheers.

404
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:14,408
That's nice.

405
00:17:17,244 --> 00:17:19,163
-You look like an athlete. Right?
-Is that so?

406
00:17:19,246 --> 00:17:20,956
-Are you an athlete?
-I'm retired now.

407
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,499
-You're retired?
-Really?

408
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:23,834
You must be in your twenties…

409
00:17:23,917 --> 00:17:25,169
-I'm 23.
-You're 23, but…

410
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:27,588
-Why are you retired at 23?
-I think I know your sport.

411
00:17:27,671 --> 00:17:28,714
You were a dancer, right?

412
00:17:28,797 --> 00:17:29,757
-No.
-I know!

413
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:30,674
-Swimmer.
-Gymnast.

414
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:31,675
Swimmer. Gymnast?

415
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:33,510
I did artistic swimming.

416
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:34,720
Synchronized swimming.

417
00:17:34,803 --> 00:17:36,263
-I was close!
-Synchronized swimming.

418
00:17:37,806 --> 00:17:39,266
I was born in 2005. I'm 20.

419
00:17:39,349 --> 00:17:40,434
Wow, you're 20?

420
00:17:40,517 --> 00:17:42,102
-What's your dream?
-What's your dream?

421
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:43,479
What do you want to do the most?

422
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:45,397
I want to become a flight attendant.

423
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:47,733
-A flight attendant. It would suit you.
-Right?

424
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:48,859
Thank you.

425
00:17:48,942 --> 00:17:50,861
-Our guests need to go to bed soon.
-Right.

426
00:17:50,944 --> 00:17:51,904
-Everyone.
-Yes?

427
00:17:51,987 --> 00:17:53,864
Those who want to sleep can go to bed.

428
00:17:53,947 --> 00:17:56,033
-It's 10:00 p.m.
-Those who want to drink can drink.

429
00:17:56,116 --> 00:17:57,493
It's all up to you.

430
00:17:57,576 --> 00:17:59,703
There should be a curtain
to divide the men and women,

431
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:01,413
but I don't see it.

432
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:09,505
We'll have to tape it on.

433
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:10,798
Yeah.

434
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:12,007
-It won't fall.
-Right.

435
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:13,258
-It'll be fine.
-It's sturdy.

436
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:14,468
BEFORE

437
00:18:14,551 --> 00:18:15,719
Good night, everyone.

438
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:17,179
-I'll see you tomorrow.
-Okay.

439
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:18,097
AFTER

440
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,640
I'll head to bed first!

441
00:18:19,723 --> 00:18:20,808
Wait for us!

442
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:22,392
10:30 P.M.
THE STAFF CLOCKS OUT

443
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:24,436
They might not be able to get up tomorrow.

444
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:27,481
-Good job today.
-Good job, everyone.

445
00:18:27,564 --> 00:18:29,108
-Hey, Boss!
-Yes?

446
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:30,526
These are…

447
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:33,278
pajamas that I made.

448
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:34,571
-Wow!
-Really?

449
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:35,823
-Yeah.
-That's amazing.

450
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:37,699
-These are called "devil pajamas."
-Okay.

451
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:38,700
Devil pajamas?

452
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:40,494
Yes, you wear them

453
00:18:40,577 --> 00:18:44,248
when you think your day
didn't go too well.

454
00:18:44,331 --> 00:18:46,083
These ones are called "angel pajamas."

455
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:49,670
You wear these when your day went well.

456
00:18:49,753 --> 00:18:51,213
When your day went well?

457
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:52,631
I did have a good day.

458
00:18:52,714 --> 00:18:54,133
These are like heirlooms.

459
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:55,759
I had five sets at home.

460
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:57,678
I gave one to Coldplay.

461
00:18:57,761 --> 00:18:59,847
-They're pretty rare.
-I gave one to Mr. Paik.

462
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:02,266
I brought the remaining two here.

463
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:04,059
I'm honored.

464
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:05,185
This is awesome.

465
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:06,145
It's cute.

466
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:12,234
KIAN BEGINS WASHING UP

467
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:14,653
THREE MINUTES LATER

468
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:22,870
-Are you taking a shower, Kian?
-Give me a second. I'm almost done.

469
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:25,247
-You're done already?
-Of course.

470
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:26,748
You're already done showering?

471
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:28,750
That makes no sense.

472
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:32,588
-I don't like long showers.
-It's not about liking it or not.

473
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:34,047
What are you talking about?

474
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:37,718
Nice.

475
00:19:37,801 --> 00:19:40,053
It does look nice.
But do we have any shampoo?

476
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:42,139
Shampoo? There's soap.

477
00:19:42,222 --> 00:19:44,099
-But no shampoo?
-All different types.

478
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:45,809
You mean all different types of soap?

479
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:47,561
There's body wash,

480
00:19:47,644 --> 00:19:49,980
shampoo, and conditioner in bar form.

481
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:58,530
THE ALPHA MALE OF ULLEUNGDO ISLAND

482
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:06,246
HAPPY WITH HOW HE LOOKS

483
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:09,458
There's a bug.

484
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:11,293
-Sir.
-Yeah?

485
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:12,377
This…

486
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:14,421
-What is it?
-Could you kill this for me?

487
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:16,673
-Is there a bug?
-Yes.

488
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:18,884
This one too! This moth too!

489
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:19,927
-This one too!
-Where?

490
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:21,386
-It just flew by.
-It's fine.

491
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:23,222
This bug is more scared of you.

492
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:25,307
Here! Here it is!

493
00:20:25,849 --> 00:20:27,684
The bug! Hurry!

494
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:28,894
Gosh, don't look.

495
00:20:28,977 --> 00:20:30,646
It's scared of you too.

496
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:34,566
It's going there to rest.

497
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:36,818
No, please! Don't!

498
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:38,445
-I killed it for you.
-Please help!

499
00:20:38,528 --> 00:20:41,240
-Don't! Help.
-Seriously? It's that bad?

500
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:42,658
-Please!
-It's here.

501
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:43,825
It went off to sleep.

502
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:45,911
No, it'll start flying around again.

503
00:20:45,994 --> 00:20:47,788
-What?
-It'll start to fly around.

504
00:20:47,871 --> 00:20:49,623
Should I turn off the light?

505
00:20:49,706 --> 00:20:51,541
Moths don't suck your blood. It's fine.

506
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:53,585
-I'll tell you if I see it again.
-Okay.

507
00:20:55,879 --> 00:20:59,341
SHOO, SHOO

508
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:02,010
WAVING THEM AWAY

509
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:08,183
KICKS

510
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:12,104
CASUALLY UNFOLDS JIN'S MAT TOO

511
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:16,942
WARMHEARTED INTENTIONS
HALF-HEARTED ACTIONS

512
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:18,026
I'm going to bed.

513
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:21,780
Good job today.

514
00:21:22,322 --> 00:21:25,909
JIN THE ANGEL GETS READY TO SLEEP TOO

515
00:21:31,748 --> 00:21:32,749
My goodness.

516
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:34,084
I'm so exhausted.

517
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:36,545
Hurry and go to sleep. You must be tired.

518
00:21:41,216 --> 00:21:43,593
THE GUESTS GO TO BED AS WELL

519
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:04,948
THE SECOND DAY

520
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:13,749
7:00 A.M.
KIAN'S B&B ANNEX, STAFF'S QUARTERS

521
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:17,085
BLANKET TURNED INSIDE OUT

522
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,507
Hello?

523
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:24,718
-Hello.
-Hello.

524
00:22:24,801 --> 00:22:27,721
-I'm the one coming in today.
-Have you arrived?

525
00:22:27,804 --> 00:22:30,307
-We have one more person in our group.
-Okay.

526
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:32,350
But he missed the train this morning.

527
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:33,477
I see.

528
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,854
He'll arrive on Ulleungdo
at about 7:00 a.m. tomorrow.

529
00:22:35,937 --> 00:22:37,105
I understand, sir.

530
00:22:37,814 --> 00:22:40,484
You have to get here by monorail.

531
00:22:41,151 --> 00:22:42,360
Is that so?

532
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:43,945
So we…

533
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:45,697
What was it?

534
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:49,743
-So we…
-Yes?

535
00:22:49,826 --> 00:22:52,287
I'll text you the address.

536
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:54,539
So you can take a taxi to that location.

537
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:56,166
-Right.
-From there…

538
00:22:56,249 --> 00:22:58,251
Then, you'll…

539
00:22:58,335 --> 00:23:00,212
-The monorail.
-You'll see the monorail.

540
00:23:00,295 --> 00:23:02,422
You can take that and ride that down here.

541
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:08,303
ON HIS WAY TO WORK IN HIS PAJAMAS

542
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:34,371
SPACING OUT IN THE MORNING

543
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:44,631
STAGGERS AS HE GOES TO WASH UP

544
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:51,888
KIAN'S B&B

545
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:17,122
ONE BY ONE, THEY GET UP

546
00:24:17,205 --> 00:24:19,207
Gosh, look at the ocean outside.

547
00:24:26,173 --> 00:24:28,300
It feels different
when you see it in the morning.

548
00:24:29,467 --> 00:24:31,178
We're deeper in the forest than I thought.

549
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:36,850
THE OWNER ARRIVES AT WORK

550
00:24:36,933 --> 00:24:37,893
Good morning.

551
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:39,311
-Did you sleep well?
-Yes.

552
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:47,611
A bird…

553
00:24:49,613 --> 00:24:51,364
A bird pooped on Jin's seat.

554
00:24:57,954 --> 00:25:01,499
SLEEPY

555
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:06,046
I wonder if he's almost here.

556
00:25:11,426 --> 00:25:14,262
AMAZED

557
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:19,226
Hello.

558
00:25:20,101 --> 00:25:21,102
-Hello.
-Hello.

559
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:22,854
Why did you oversleep yesterday

560
00:25:23,688 --> 00:25:24,814
and miss the train?

561
00:25:25,565 --> 00:25:27,275
A bird pooped on the middle seat.

562
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:29,027
-So sit in the front.
-Okay.

563
00:25:32,447 --> 00:25:35,492
I can tell you're friends
with the guys who came yesterday.

564
00:25:35,575 --> 00:25:36,910
What's your name?

565
00:25:36,993 --> 00:25:38,370
My name is Kim Ki-hong.

566
00:25:38,453 --> 00:25:39,496
Jim Ji-hyeon?

567
00:25:39,579 --> 00:25:41,373
What? No. It's Kim Ki-hong.

568
00:25:41,456 --> 00:25:42,374
Kim Ji-hyeon?

569
00:25:42,457 --> 00:25:43,375
No.

570
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:47,879
-Your name's Kim Ji-hyeon?
-No.

571
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:48,797
Kim.

572
00:25:49,422 --> 00:25:51,174
-Okay.
-Kim Ki…

573
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:52,342
Ki-hyeon?

574
00:25:52,425 --> 00:25:53,385
Yes, that's right.

575
00:25:53,468 --> 00:25:54,302
I see. Ki-hyeon.

576
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:55,387
Yes.

577
00:25:56,888 --> 00:25:59,891
GIVES UP ON TALKING TO KIAN

578
00:26:01,017 --> 00:26:01,977
Is someone coming?

579
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:03,144
I think it's our friend.

580
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:04,646
-Your friend?
-Yeah.

581
00:26:05,563 --> 00:26:06,564
Hi.

582
00:26:10,777 --> 00:26:12,821
-Do you also study at KAIST?
-Yes?

583
00:26:12,904 --> 00:26:13,905
That's right.

584
00:26:14,489 --> 00:26:15,824
There's no breakfast today.

585
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:16,825
Really?

586
00:26:17,617 --> 00:26:20,161
So, we had dinner last night
in place of breakfast today.

587
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:22,706
-We'll resume serving it tomorrow.
-They'll have it tomorrow.

588
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:25,292
Everyone, even nice hotels…

589
00:26:26,042 --> 00:26:27,794
don't offer three square meals.

590
00:26:27,877 --> 00:26:29,296
-They only serve breakfast.
-I see.

591
00:26:29,379 --> 00:26:31,172
-So…
-But I haven't had breakfast.

592
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:34,551
That's why you should've come yesterday.

593
00:26:34,634 --> 00:26:36,886
-You're right.
-But we have instant noodles.

594
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:39,514
-Help yourself if you'd like.
-Okay.

595
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:40,974
So…

596
00:26:41,057 --> 00:26:43,268
Let me know if you have any problems.

597
00:26:43,351 --> 00:26:44,561
-Okay.
-All right.

598
00:26:45,603 --> 00:26:47,063
I need another hour of sleep.

599
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:51,776
I'm Kim Ki-hong.

600
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:53,570
Ki-hong? Nice to meet you.

601
00:26:53,653 --> 00:26:54,821
It looks like Jin's up.

602
00:27:11,212 --> 00:27:12,797
-Did you get some sleep?
-Yes.

603
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:14,924
-Good morning.
-Yeah.

604
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:16,426
You were snoring last night.

605
00:27:16,509 --> 00:27:17,510
It woke me right up.

606
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:21,181
Goodness…

607
00:27:22,223 --> 00:27:25,060
THE EMPLOYEE WORKED HARDER THAN THE OWNER

608
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:26,770
Why is he the one snoring?

609
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:29,689
We didn't do the dishes, did we?

610
00:27:29,773 --> 00:27:31,649
I'll go and wash the dishes.

611
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:32,650
-Now?
-Yeah.

612
00:27:33,234 --> 00:27:34,194
Let's go together then.

613
00:27:34,277 --> 00:27:35,320
No, I'll do it alone.

614
00:27:35,403 --> 00:27:36,946
It's not big enough for two anyway.

615
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:39,240
-What's not big enough?
-The area for washing dishes.

616
00:27:40,116 --> 00:27:42,660
Boss, I'm heading out first.

617
00:27:42,744 --> 00:27:44,746
-Thank you for the food.
-Sure.

618
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:47,207
DIY RAMYEON BREAKFAST

619
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:49,918
-It's slowly getting hot.
-Right.

620
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:52,170
The weather is perfect for snorkeling.

621
00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:54,422
Good morning.

622
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:56,424
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

623
00:27:59,636 --> 00:28:00,887
Guess who he is.

624
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:04,974
Why do you keep putting me on the spot?

625
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:06,768
I guess all you did was study in school.

626
00:28:07,811 --> 00:28:11,356
BY THE WAY, WHO ARE YOU?

627
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,401
-Would you like some?
-He woke up puffy today.

628
00:28:14,484 --> 00:28:16,152
-He woke up very puffy.
-Who are you?

629
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:17,612
THEY BOTH DON'T KNOW EACH OTHER

630
00:28:18,613 --> 00:28:21,616
HE DIDN'T TELL ANYONE ABOUT THE NEW GUEST

631
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:24,953
CHECKS THE DISHES TO WASH

632
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:27,789
STARTS WASHING THE DISHES

633
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:32,252
You were washing dishes?
Gosh, you're working so hard.

634
00:28:32,335 --> 00:28:33,920
It's no problem. You can leave it here.

635
00:28:34,671 --> 00:28:35,588
Thank you so much.

636
00:28:35,672 --> 00:28:37,382
-No problem.
-You're working so early.

637
00:28:37,465 --> 00:28:38,967
You can put it in here.

638
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:40,218
MORE DISHES TO WASH

639
00:28:40,301 --> 00:28:41,845
Thank you.

640
00:28:41,928 --> 00:28:42,971
ALL DISHES RECEIVED

641
00:28:48,518 --> 00:28:49,936
THE FAUCET IS A BIT TOO HIGH

642
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:53,148
GETS UP

643
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:55,817
AND SITS DOWN AGAIN TO WASH THE DISHES

644
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,403
My arms are aching.

645
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:04,117
What was Kian thinking when he built this?

646
00:29:06,536 --> 00:29:07,537
Hey, Ye-eun.

647
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:09,831
We got one more guest.

648
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:12,625
-He's a friend of the KAIST guys.
-Right, he was late yesterday.

649
00:29:12,709 --> 00:29:14,544
The new guy didn't have breakfast.

650
00:29:14,627 --> 00:29:17,088
-Should I make some soy milk?
-That's a good idea.

651
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:18,673
SOMETHING SHE BROUGHT FOR THE GUESTS

652
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:20,550
I'll go make some.

653
00:29:20,633 --> 00:29:23,178
OFF TO MAKE HOMEMADE SOY MILK

654
00:29:24,304 --> 00:29:28,308
TIME FOR KIAN TO WASH UP

655
00:29:28,975 --> 00:29:31,102
KIAN'S WAY OF WASHING UP

656
00:29:32,645 --> 00:29:35,231
KIAN'S WAY OF BRUSHING HIS TONGUE

657
00:29:36,524 --> 00:29:40,320
CLEANLY FLOSSES AS WELL

658
00:29:41,362 --> 00:29:43,907
WASHES HIS FACE AND RINSES HIS MOUTH
AT THE SAME TIME

659
00:29:44,491 --> 00:29:46,451
SHAVES WITH LEFTOVER WATER ON HIS FACE

660
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:56,628
RINSING THE FACE AFTER SHAVING IS A WASTE

661
00:29:56,711 --> 00:29:57,962
DONE

662
00:29:58,046 --> 00:29:58,880
Sunscreen.

663
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:10,600
SMOTHERED IN SUNSCREEN

664
00:30:11,392 --> 00:30:12,977
-Hello.
-Hello.

665
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:14,437
YE-EUN ARRIVES AT WORK

666
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:16,773
-Are you the new guest?
-Yes, I should've come yesterday.

667
00:30:16,856 --> 00:30:18,358
I heard you were hungry.

668
00:30:18,441 --> 00:30:20,610
I brought a soy milk maker.

669
00:30:20,693 --> 00:30:22,737
HOMEMADE SOY MILK FOR THE LATE GUEST

670
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:24,447
BLACK BEANS

671
00:30:24,531 --> 00:30:26,491
It's really good for your health.

672
00:30:26,574 --> 00:30:29,661
TIMER

673
00:30:31,621 --> 00:30:33,623
KIAN RETURNS TO WORK

674
00:30:33,706 --> 00:30:35,333
We need sponges.

675
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:38,336
LET'S CLEAN

676
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:41,256
COLLECTS THE "ITALIAN" GREEN ONIONS

677
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:42,298
Cups.

678
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:45,552
-I think it's done.
-It's done!

679
00:30:47,637 --> 00:30:49,055
It's very thick.

680
00:30:52,183 --> 00:30:53,601
-You first, Ki-hong.
-Give it a try.

681
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:54,686
It looks delicious.

682
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:01,526
-It's nice.
-Yeah.

683
00:31:04,404 --> 00:31:06,531
It's good. It's very rich.

684
00:31:07,156 --> 00:31:09,784
YE-EUN'S HOMEMADE SOY MILK

685
00:31:12,996 --> 00:31:15,248
WRITING ON SLIPPERS?

686
00:31:15,331 --> 00:31:16,833
-Hey, Boss.
-Yeah?

687
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:19,752
Toss me those slippers.

688
00:31:28,511 --> 00:31:29,596
"S1?"

689
00:31:30,096 --> 00:31:31,431
Those are yours.

690
00:31:31,514 --> 00:31:32,599
Why did you write "S"?

691
00:31:32,682 --> 00:31:34,309
-Staff 1.
-I see.

692
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:37,103
THE OWNER'S SLIPPERS, S1

693
00:31:37,186 --> 00:31:38,730
Hold on.

694
00:31:40,273 --> 00:31:41,816
His slippers are dirty.

695
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:44,319
We can wash them again.

696
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:46,029
You have athlete's foot, don't you?

697
00:31:46,112 --> 00:31:47,113
Me?

698
00:31:48,281 --> 00:31:51,159
Hey, we can get athlete's foot together
and grow close that way.

699
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:52,619
Do you really have athlete's foot?

700
00:31:53,202 --> 00:31:54,412
Athlete's foot? No.

701
00:31:54,495 --> 00:31:55,413
Be honest.

702
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:57,165
It comes and goes.

703
00:31:58,249 --> 00:31:59,709
-You don't have it?
-He's so honest.

704
00:31:59,792 --> 00:32:00,793
Of course not!

705
00:32:00,877 --> 00:32:02,378
You usually get it while in the army.

706
00:32:02,462 --> 00:32:03,338
Sir!

707
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:07,008
Aren't you supposed to get it
by working hard for the ARMY?

708
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:08,468
That's some insane logic.

709
00:32:08,551 --> 00:32:11,012
Our fans won't like it
if we have athlete's foot.

710
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:13,181
They're not true fans if they hate that.

711
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:15,808
-Ridiculous! Who likes athlete's foot?
-It's beautiful.

712
00:32:15,892 --> 00:32:17,602
Ye-eun, do you like athlete's foot?

713
00:32:17,685 --> 00:32:19,729
I love it so much! I wish I had it.

714
00:32:19,812 --> 00:32:21,773
-The appeal of athlete's foot…
-Wear those then.

715
00:32:21,856 --> 00:32:23,942
I should secretly pass my virus onto her.

716
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:27,320
On the day we leave,
she starts scratching her feet like crazy.

717
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:42,752
We have to get there today.

718
00:32:48,675 --> 00:32:50,677
The weather was nice.

719
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:53,888
So all I could think about
was the main B&B here.

720
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:57,141
THE MAIN KIAN'S B&B ON THE SEA

721
00:33:01,437 --> 00:33:04,524
THEY DECIDE TO MOVE TO THE MAIN B&B

722
00:33:04,607 --> 00:33:05,483
Everyone,

723
00:33:05,566 --> 00:33:07,318
we might move,

724
00:33:08,027 --> 00:33:09,696
so you should pack your stuff.

725
00:33:09,779 --> 00:33:11,531
You should have most things packed.

726
00:33:11,614 --> 00:33:13,157
-Okay.
-All right.

727
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:16,202
-We might move because the weather's nice.
-Okay.

728
00:33:16,285 --> 00:33:17,453
We'll get going now.

729
00:33:17,537 --> 00:33:18,663
They're going out.

730
00:33:18,746 --> 00:33:21,499
-See you later.
-Have fun.

731
00:33:21,582 --> 00:33:22,709
-Have fun.
-See you tonight.

732
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:23,710
Take care.

733
00:33:27,213 --> 00:33:28,798
Where are you going to hike?

734
00:33:28,881 --> 00:33:31,759
We're going snorkeling today.
We'll go rent scooters.

735
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:33,094
Scooters?

736
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:34,679
Let's drop off the guests.

737
00:33:35,263 --> 00:33:36,764
Then, let's visit the barge.

738
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:38,474
DROP OFF GUESTS
AND MOVE TO THE BARGE

739
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:39,851
Goodness.

740
00:33:39,934 --> 00:33:41,310
My gosh.

741
00:33:42,228 --> 00:33:45,481
THE STAFF ARE ON THEIR WAY

742
00:33:47,817 --> 00:33:49,527
It's so picturesque here.

743
00:33:50,111 --> 00:33:51,237
It's beautiful.

744
00:33:52,739 --> 00:33:54,866
Brace yourselves for the bump!

745
00:33:57,785 --> 00:34:00,621
Please send it right down.
Our guests are waiting for it.

746
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:02,373
WHILE THE STAFF PREPARES THE VEHICLES

747
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:05,835
TEAM KAIST IS ON THEIR WAY

748
00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:10,423
I thought you were patting my head.

749
00:34:14,802 --> 00:34:16,471
-You're going to rent scooters?
-Yes.

750
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:17,805
Where is the place?

751
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:20,475
-It's near Ulleung County Office.
-It's here.

752
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:22,143
KIAN'S B&B

753
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:25,605
TOWN CENTER

754
00:34:25,688 --> 00:34:27,148
I'll take a person on my motorbike.

755
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:28,149
Rock, paper, scissors.

756
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:30,109
MODES OF TRANSPORTATION
FOR KIAN'S B&B

757
00:34:30,193 --> 00:34:31,569
CAR
TO BE REVEALED

758
00:34:31,652 --> 00:34:34,489
MOTORCYCLE

759
00:34:35,615 --> 00:34:38,201
WITH A SIDECAR

760
00:34:38,284 --> 00:34:40,286
KIAN AND SEONG-EUN ON THE MOTORCYCLE

761
00:34:40,369 --> 00:34:42,371
JIN, YE-EUN, SUNG-HO,
AND KI-HONG IN THE CAR

762
00:34:42,455 --> 00:34:45,583
JIN'S RIDE, KIAN'S RIDE

763
00:34:50,838 --> 00:34:52,131
-This is fun.
-It is.

764
00:34:56,344 --> 00:34:58,262
HAHAHA

765
00:35:03,184 --> 00:35:05,728
EXCITED

766
00:35:08,314 --> 00:35:10,149
The sidecar is so cute.

767
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:11,692
Let's ride in that next time.

768
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:12,860
-Sure.
-It looks so fun.

769
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:18,741
-All right, take care.
-See you later.

770
00:35:18,825 --> 00:35:19,951
-Bye.
-See you later.

771
00:35:20,034 --> 00:35:21,953
-Bye. See you later.
-Bye.

772
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:24,872
THE STAFF HEAD TO THE MAIN B&B

773
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:26,707
Maybe riding in the car would be better.

774
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:28,459
Are you scared?

775
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:30,336
-It should be fine, right?
-Tell me…

776
00:35:30,419 --> 00:35:32,171
-Tell me if you feel scared to death.
-Okay.

777
00:35:37,176 --> 00:35:39,637
Wow, this is fun.

778
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,722
This road is so nice.

779
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:43,558
Look how clear the sky is.

780
00:35:45,184 --> 00:35:46,561
It's so nice!

781
00:35:47,186 --> 00:35:48,479
It's beautiful.

782
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,984
Look at the color! it's so pretty!

783
00:35:53,067 --> 00:35:55,862
This is absolutely beautiful.

784
00:35:55,945 --> 00:35:58,447
What do you call that?
The reflection on the sea?

785
00:35:58,531 --> 00:35:59,866
-Heat haze?
-Sun glitter.

786
00:35:59,949 --> 00:36:01,242
Right, sun glitter.

787
00:36:01,325 --> 00:36:02,702
Isn't it pretty?

788
00:36:02,785 --> 00:36:03,619
Yeah, it is.

789
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:07,832
SUN GLITTER, NOT HEAT HAZE

790
00:36:07,915 --> 00:36:10,042
This has been the best part
since coming to Ulleungdo.

791
00:36:10,751 --> 00:36:11,627
I'm so happy.

792
00:36:13,546 --> 00:36:16,048
SAME TIME, DIFFERENT FEEL

793
00:36:16,132 --> 00:36:17,466
Is this the right road?

794
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:19,343
Being alone is so boring.

795
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:20,636
I'm so lonely.

796
00:36:22,054 --> 00:36:23,181
Gosh, it's so pretty.

797
00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:30,605
That's not it, right?

798
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:32,273
What?

799
00:36:33,816 --> 00:36:35,401
THAT?

800
00:36:36,068 --> 00:36:36,986
CAN'T SEE ANYTHING

801
00:36:37,069 --> 00:36:38,070
That's the B&B, right?

802
00:36:38,154 --> 00:36:40,865
THIS

803
00:36:40,948 --> 00:36:42,408
That's the B&B.

804
00:36:42,491 --> 00:36:43,534
Unbelievable.

805
00:36:43,618 --> 00:36:44,577
Yeah, you're right.

806
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:45,703
B&B SPOTTED ON THE SEA

807
00:36:45,786 --> 00:36:47,371
That's incredible.

808
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:49,832
It's really floating on the sea? My gosh.

809
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:51,876
FEELING PROUD

810
00:36:53,252 --> 00:36:55,796
KIAN'S DREAMS COME TRUE

811
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,256
Finally, it's your time to shine.

812
00:36:57,340 --> 00:37:00,134
My gosh! I'm going to lose my mind.

813
00:37:01,344 --> 00:37:03,596
-It's a bit worrying.
-Wait, hold on.

814
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:05,056
You're driving…

815
00:37:05,139 --> 00:37:07,808
It's my first time on the ocean.
But you won't die.

816
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:09,894
A BOAT ALL OF A SUDDEN?

817
00:37:09,977 --> 00:37:11,979
Are you sure about this? Can you drive it?

818
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:13,147
I'll have to try and see.

819
00:37:13,981 --> 00:37:17,777
SPECIAL MISSION FROM THE PRODUCTION TEAM
GET A BOATING LICENSE

820
00:37:18,361 --> 00:37:21,364
JUMPING INTO PRACTICE
WITHOUT EVEN KNOWING WHY

821
00:37:21,447 --> 00:37:24,742
This is so embarrassing,
but I got it on my fourth attempt.

822
00:37:25,534 --> 00:37:27,536
I did study really hard.

823
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:31,249
CAPTAIN JI'S MISSION FROM NOW ON

824
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:33,709
PICK UP THE GUESTS

825
00:37:33,793 --> 00:37:35,920
FROM THE PORT

826
00:37:36,295 --> 00:37:38,005
AND GO 800M

827
00:37:40,716 --> 00:37:42,426
TO KIAN'S B&B

828
00:37:43,386 --> 00:37:45,179
IN PARTICULAR, THE TURN

829
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:48,516
THROUGH THE BREAKWATER
IS THE TOUGHEST PART

830
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:49,433
STARTING POINT

831
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:51,352
DESTINATION

832
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:53,396
TODAY IS HER FIRST TRY
AT DRIVING ON THE SEA

833
00:37:53,479 --> 00:37:55,439
WILL CAPTAIN JI BE ABLE TO DO WELL?

834
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:57,525
-Are you nervous?
-Of course, I am!

835
00:37:57,608 --> 00:37:59,527
-Why are you nervous?
-I don't know.

836
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:01,070
I'm so nervous.

837
00:38:01,153 --> 00:38:02,154
Show us what you've got.

838
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:04,031
This is crazy.

839
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:05,157
We'll depart now.

840
00:38:07,618 --> 00:38:08,953
Wow, Ye-eun!

841
00:38:10,413 --> 00:38:11,580
This is crazy!

842
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:14,417
-Ye-eun, you're doing great!
-Nice.

843
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:15,960
This is great.

844
00:38:16,043 --> 00:38:17,253
Go, Ye-eun!

845
00:38:18,004 --> 00:38:20,131
-You're doing great!
-Go faster, Ye-eun!

846
00:38:20,214 --> 00:38:21,048
To the left.

847
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:23,926
-This is insane, Ye-eun.
-I know.

848
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:25,177
-Wait.
-Hey, Ye-eun!

849
00:38:25,261 --> 00:38:27,138
-That's the breakwater!
-We'll crash!

850
00:38:27,221 --> 00:38:28,055
Hey, Ye-eun!

851
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:29,682
-That's the breakwater!
-We'll crash!

852
00:38:29,765 --> 00:38:31,017
-Hey!
-Hey!

853
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:32,935
-Wait. Hey!
-Hey!

854
00:38:33,019 --> 00:38:35,146
-Hey!
-Hey!

855
00:38:35,229 --> 00:38:37,023
-Wait. Hey!
-Hey!

856
00:38:37,106 --> 00:38:39,191
-Are you trying to kill us?
-Hey!

857
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:40,318
The breakwater!

858
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:41,944
Keep quiet!

859
00:38:42,028 --> 00:38:43,571
-Shut your mouth!
-Okay, I'll be quiet.

860
00:38:43,654 --> 00:38:44,572
Geez!

861
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:46,115
-I mean…
-You have to trust me.

862
00:38:46,198 --> 00:38:47,783
-I can do this.
-All right.

863
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:49,493
THEY GET PAST THE DANGER

864
00:38:50,036 --> 00:38:51,954
BEYOND THE BREAKWATER

865
00:38:53,372 --> 00:38:54,373
AROUND THE BREAKWATER

866
00:38:54,457 --> 00:38:56,625
INNER PORT, OUTER PORT

867
00:38:56,709 --> 00:39:01,505
THE INNER PORT HAS CALMER WAVES
THE OUTER PORT HAS STRONGER WAVES

868
00:39:02,882 --> 00:39:03,799
Where is it?

869
00:39:03,883 --> 00:39:05,259
I can see it over there!

870
00:39:07,386 --> 00:39:09,972
My fellow warriors,
I see our destination ahead!

871
00:39:10,056 --> 00:39:11,349
You're doing well.

872
00:39:11,432 --> 00:39:12,725
Let's go!

873
00:39:14,935 --> 00:39:17,438
Let's go! Destroy them all!

874
00:39:23,152 --> 00:39:24,320
The boat is flying!

875
00:39:25,821 --> 00:39:26,947
This is…

876
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:29,283
We're going to fly off
into the clouds at this rate!

877
00:39:31,494 --> 00:39:32,870
COLLAPSES

878
00:39:32,953 --> 00:39:34,372
STUMBLES

879
00:39:34,455 --> 00:39:36,290
UTTER CHAOS

880
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:37,792
Get up!

881
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:40,002
We're going to fly off into the sky!

882
00:39:42,129 --> 00:39:43,339
My goodness!

883
00:39:45,132 --> 00:39:47,301
-You call yourself a captain?
-What the…

884
00:39:48,928 --> 00:39:50,763
Ye-eun, what are you doing?

885
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:54,225
Look, I haven't…

886
00:39:55,768 --> 00:39:56,602
What are you doing?

887
00:39:56,685 --> 00:39:58,896
I haven't driven
on such strong waves before.

888
00:39:58,979 --> 00:40:00,064
What are you doing?

889
00:40:00,689 --> 00:40:02,733
-I can't believe we made it.
-We're finally here.

890
00:40:02,817 --> 00:40:04,568
We're really here.

891
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:05,903
This is amazing!

892
00:40:08,697 --> 00:40:10,157
AFLOAT IN THE WATERS OF ULLEUNGDO

893
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:11,700
IS THE MAIN B&B

894
00:40:12,493 --> 00:40:14,286
KIAN'S B&B

895
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:16,705
WHERE KIAN'S IMAGINATION HAS COME TO LIFE

896
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:21,710
WITH THE ELEPHANT ROCK IN THE BACKGROUND

897
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:31,178
-Just a moment.
-It looks scary up there.

898
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:32,805
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

899
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:36,434
THEY FINALLY STEP ABOARD THE BARGE

900
00:40:36,517 --> 00:40:37,768
We're finally here.

901
00:40:41,021 --> 00:40:42,106
This is so moving.

902
00:40:43,816 --> 00:40:46,360
OVERFLOWING WITH DOPAMINE

903
00:40:48,696 --> 00:40:50,030
This is amazing!

904
00:40:52,158 --> 00:40:53,659
It's better than I thought.

905
00:40:53,742 --> 00:40:55,494
REALLY?

906
00:40:56,579 --> 00:40:58,497
OVERFLOWING WITH DOPAMINE AGAIN

907
00:40:59,248 --> 00:41:00,499
They built this so well.

908
00:41:01,417 --> 00:41:02,501
How about we go inside?

909
00:41:03,752 --> 00:41:04,753
That'll be the problem.

910
00:41:05,546 --> 00:41:06,547
HA HA…

911
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:09,467
How do we sleep here?

912
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:11,343
I mean, the beds are…

913
00:41:11,427 --> 00:41:13,137
-They're small.
-They're not long enough.

914
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:14,889
It's going to really hurt if you fall.

915
00:41:14,972 --> 00:41:17,099
Still, we won't die though.

916
00:41:17,975 --> 00:41:21,520
I made an outdoor sleeping area.

917
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,482
Rock climbers sleep on cliffs like this.

918
00:41:24,565 --> 00:41:26,400
-Right.
-So we'll sleep here.

919
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:27,735
THREE-STORY BEDS

920
00:41:28,944 --> 00:41:31,280
We'll put two slides here,
so we can go in and out.

921
00:41:33,073 --> 00:41:34,033
ACCESS THE FIRST FLOOR

922
00:41:34,116 --> 00:41:36,118
WITH THE PINK SLIDE

923
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:39,079
You get on the slide to get down…

924
00:41:39,955 --> 00:41:41,582
-Right to the sea.
-My goodness.

925
00:41:41,665 --> 00:41:43,125
You slip right into the sea.

926
00:41:43,209 --> 00:41:46,003
THE YELLOW SLIDE LEADS YOU
STRAIGHT INTO THE SEA

927
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:50,883
IT'S YOUR CHOICE

928
00:41:50,966 --> 00:41:52,468
How can we sleep up there?

929
00:41:52,551 --> 00:41:55,221
Seriously, we're going to wake up
when the sun rises.

930
00:41:55,304 --> 00:41:57,515
You're supposed to wake up
when the sun rises.

931
00:41:57,598 --> 00:41:59,725
TAKEN ABACK

932
00:41:59,808 --> 00:42:01,685
Go to sleep when the sun sets.

933
00:42:01,769 --> 00:42:03,395
Are those the buckets?

934
00:42:03,479 --> 00:42:05,105
Yes, that's where you'll shower.

935
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:08,567
You can splash water on yourself
or take a shower.

936
00:42:09,318 --> 00:42:11,737
We're at the end of summer.

937
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:13,822
SPEECHLESS

938
00:42:13,906 --> 00:42:16,325
-I'm just speechless.
-Seriously, me too.

939
00:42:17,159 --> 00:42:18,410
I mean, this…

940
00:42:19,161 --> 00:42:20,621
How do we go up?

941
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:24,583
THE CLIMBING ZONE

942
00:42:24,667 --> 00:42:26,794
The climbing area entrance
is on the second floor.

943
00:42:27,503 --> 00:42:29,296
You have to put it at the far end.

944
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:32,007
That way, we have to climb
as high as possible to go in.

945
00:42:33,509 --> 00:42:34,635
I've never done this before.

946
00:42:34,718 --> 00:42:35,803
FIRST TRY AT CLIMBING

947
00:42:35,886 --> 00:42:37,054
I'm sure you can climb it.

948
00:42:38,931 --> 00:42:41,684
You're light, so I think you can do it.

949
00:42:42,726 --> 00:42:43,769
He's going to make it!

950
00:42:45,437 --> 00:42:46,272
I mean…

951
00:42:46,855 --> 00:42:49,233
TREMBLING

952
00:42:50,317 --> 00:42:51,610
HAVING SO MUCH FUN

953
00:42:51,694 --> 00:42:52,778
I mean…

954
00:42:52,861 --> 00:42:54,822
-Hold on.
-How is it?

955
00:42:54,905 --> 00:42:56,115
It's scary, isn't it?

956
00:42:56,198 --> 00:42:57,116
Hold on a second.

957
00:42:57,658 --> 00:42:59,076
That part's hard, right?

958
00:42:59,159 --> 00:43:00,953
-No!
-It gets hard from there.

959
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:03,581
No!

960
00:43:03,664 --> 00:43:04,665
Hey!

961
00:43:05,749 --> 00:43:07,376
-Come on, Boss.
-The thing is…

962
00:43:07,459 --> 00:43:10,087
I didn't want people to get in easily.

963
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:12,006
We can't enter the B&B!

964
00:43:12,089 --> 00:43:13,507
The owner's lost his mind.

965
00:43:14,174 --> 00:43:15,801
-We can't get in at all.
-I mean…

966
00:43:15,884 --> 00:43:17,344
What do you mean "get in easily"?

967
00:43:17,428 --> 00:43:18,262
I didn't want…

968
00:43:18,345 --> 00:43:21,015
I didn't want to see people
enter the B&B so easily.

969
00:43:21,098 --> 00:43:22,641
I wanted to make it hard for them.

970
00:43:22,725 --> 00:43:24,518
Wait. Let me try again.

971
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:25,769
I'll try again.

972
00:43:25,853 --> 00:43:28,022
I can use different colored holds, right?

973
00:43:28,105 --> 00:43:29,648
I don't think I can get up otherwise.

974
00:43:29,732 --> 00:43:31,609
We'll have to use
a variety of holds to go up.

975
00:43:31,692 --> 00:43:32,735
Hold on.

976
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:34,486
MEANWHILE, YE-EUN…

977
00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:36,322
Can you go up the slides?

978
00:43:37,948 --> 00:43:39,783
You'll have to keep this in mind.

979
00:43:39,867 --> 00:43:41,493
Things that aren't entrances…

980
00:43:41,577 --> 00:43:42,411
The slides.

981
00:43:42,494 --> 00:43:44,330
-If people try to go up the slides…
-Okay.

982
00:43:44,413 --> 00:43:45,706
-you have to stop them.
-Okay.

983
00:43:45,789 --> 00:43:47,166
-That's a rule.
-Okay.

984
00:43:49,335 --> 00:43:52,546
SHE'S GOOD AT ANSWERING,
NOT LISTENING

985
00:43:54,923 --> 00:43:55,758
GIGGLING

986
00:43:55,841 --> 00:43:56,800
I got up.

987
00:43:59,094 --> 00:44:00,054
I'm here!

988
00:44:00,137 --> 00:44:02,848
How did you get up?
Hey, you can't use the slides.

989
00:44:02,931 --> 00:44:04,725
-I'm here.
-Yeah, you can't use the slides.

990
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:06,435
That's…

991
00:44:06,518 --> 00:44:08,062
-That's cheating.
-That's…

992
00:44:08,854 --> 00:44:11,273
disrespecting those…

993
00:44:11,357 --> 00:44:13,108
those who climbed up…

994
00:44:13,192 --> 00:44:14,109
This is amazing!

995
00:44:17,738 --> 00:44:18,572
Hold on.

996
00:44:23,410 --> 00:44:24,328
-Boss!
-Yeah?

997
00:44:24,411 --> 00:44:25,663
Are you crazy?

998
00:44:27,748 --> 00:44:29,083
I'm going to lose it.

999
00:44:29,833 --> 00:44:31,251
Just because you can't climb this?

1000
00:44:32,086 --> 00:44:35,714
LET ME SHOW YOU

1001
00:44:37,633 --> 00:44:39,218
A DEEP SIGH

1002
00:44:43,013 --> 00:44:45,683
THE TOUGH PART WHERE JIN KEPT FALLING

1003
00:44:45,766 --> 00:44:46,600
I got it.

1004
00:44:47,643 --> 00:44:48,519
I got it!

1005
00:44:49,812 --> 00:44:51,313
HE DID IT?

1006
00:44:51,397 --> 00:44:52,481
I got it!

1007
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:54,358
Did you make it, Kian?

1008
00:44:55,150 --> 00:44:56,151
He's here.

1009
00:44:57,444 --> 00:44:58,529
So this is it.

1010
00:44:58,612 --> 00:45:00,155
ENTERS ON ALL FOURS

1011
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:01,407
-How funny.
-This is it.

1012
00:45:03,659 --> 00:45:05,411
I'm going to lose my mind. This is…

1013
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:07,663
Hey, come up. It's so nice here.

1014
00:45:07,746 --> 00:45:09,581
Can you help me from up there?

1015
00:45:09,665 --> 00:45:12,626
TRUSTS KIAN WILL HELP
AND CLIMBS UP AGAIN

1016
00:45:12,709 --> 00:45:14,795
-Now.
-Do I grab your hand now?

1017
00:45:14,878 --> 00:45:15,879
Grab my hand.

1018
00:45:19,883 --> 00:45:21,218
Even if things are difficult,

1019
00:45:21,301 --> 00:45:22,845
I want people to bond.

1020
00:45:22,928 --> 00:45:24,555
Struggles leave a lasting impression.

1021
00:45:24,638 --> 00:45:26,598
If it's easy, it isn't memorable.

1022
00:45:26,682 --> 00:45:27,558
Slowly.

1023
00:45:28,267 --> 00:45:29,101
You got it.

1024
00:45:29,184 --> 00:45:30,102
I got it.

1025
00:45:30,185 --> 00:45:31,520
-My goodness!
-Did he make it?

1026
00:45:32,771 --> 00:45:33,605
Geez!

1027
00:45:34,356 --> 00:45:35,691
Come on!

1028
00:45:36,108 --> 00:45:37,609
ENTERED SUCCESSFULLY BY BONDING

1029
00:45:37,693 --> 00:45:39,319
This is impossible to climb!

1030
00:45:39,403 --> 00:45:40,946
He's right. Seriously.

1031
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:42,573
THANK YOU FOR CLIMBING UP

1032
00:45:42,656 --> 00:45:44,575
LET US INTRODUCE THE SECOND FLOOR

1033
00:45:45,242 --> 00:45:47,077
ENTRANCE TO THE BEDS

1034
00:45:48,662 --> 00:45:50,456
WHEN YOU OPEN THE DOOR

1035
00:45:50,914 --> 00:45:53,667
YOU'LL FIND BEDS
WITH AN AMAZING VIEW

1036
00:45:54,918 --> 00:45:57,129
-Where do we put the guests' luggage?
-Their luggage…

1037
00:45:57,212 --> 00:45:58,672
We need a room for clothes.

1038
00:45:58,755 --> 00:46:00,382
There is an area for luggage.

1039
00:46:00,466 --> 00:46:02,009
-Where?
-If you look here…

1040
00:46:02,092 --> 00:46:03,135
Geez, it's hot!

1041
00:46:04,052 --> 00:46:04,887
It's so hot!

1042
00:46:04,970 --> 00:46:06,096
It's too hot to sleep there.

1043
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:07,973
-It's literally impossible.
-Look.

1044
00:46:08,056 --> 00:46:09,266
-Like this.
-Where?

1045
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:12,394
It's actually pretty high up here.

1046
00:46:12,478 --> 00:46:13,854
This is a cabinet.

1047
00:46:13,937 --> 00:46:15,314
-Okay.
-Right here.

1048
00:46:15,981 --> 00:46:17,107
There's an outlet too.

1049
00:46:17,191 --> 00:46:18,525
You can charge your phone.

1050
00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:20,194
This is ridiculous.

1051
00:46:20,277 --> 00:46:22,779
Let's say you want to take a nap here.

1052
00:46:24,198 --> 00:46:26,533
-Just like this.
-Who'd sleep there? It's too hot!

1053
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:27,784
-I mean…
-Who would…

1054
00:46:29,912 --> 00:46:32,706
This is so scary.
No one's going to sleep here!

1055
00:46:32,789 --> 00:46:35,959
-It's too scary to sleep there.
-Let's say you roll off while sleeping.

1056
00:46:36,043 --> 00:46:39,004
-There are more mats down there.
-But if you fall from here…

1057
00:46:39,087 --> 00:46:41,715
People are going to be
too afraid to sleep here.

1058
00:46:41,798 --> 00:46:43,008
It's really scary up here.

1059
00:46:43,091 --> 00:46:44,801
-Up there? That is pretty high.
-Yeah.

1060
00:46:44,885 --> 00:46:46,970
This is where we can tell who's selfless.

1061
00:46:47,054 --> 00:46:49,139
Because those who'll sleep
on the top bunks

1062
00:46:49,223 --> 00:46:51,141
will get wet if it rains.

1063
00:46:51,433 --> 00:46:56,355
We can witness
beautiful acts of sacrifice.

1064
00:46:56,855 --> 00:47:00,901
KIAN'S PHILOSOPHY
THE SELFLESS SHALL SLEEP ON THE TOP BUNKS

1065
00:47:00,984 --> 00:47:02,778
I'll use that bed over there.

1066
00:47:02,861 --> 00:47:03,904
-Where?
-There.

1067
00:47:03,987 --> 00:47:05,072
-There?
-Yeah, that one.

1068
00:47:05,989 --> 00:47:07,449
Then, I'll use a top bunk.

1069
00:47:07,533 --> 00:47:09,076
I should set the example.

1070
00:47:09,993 --> 00:47:12,246
THE SIGHT OF A RESPONSIBLE MAN
FROM THE BACK

1071
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:14,248
PEEKS OVER

1072
00:47:14,998 --> 00:47:17,334
Damn. It's so high up here.

1073
00:47:17,417 --> 00:47:19,586
Let me check how high it looks from below.

1074
00:47:24,132 --> 00:47:25,592
How do I get down from here?

1075
00:47:27,052 --> 00:47:28,845
-Kian.
-Hey, Jin-seok.

1076
00:47:28,929 --> 00:47:30,472
-It's Seok-jin.
-It's too hot.

1077
00:47:31,181 --> 00:47:32,724
My real name's Seok-jin.

1078
00:47:32,808 --> 00:47:34,393
-Okay, Jin.
-How do I get down?

1079
00:47:34,476 --> 00:47:35,644
I'm even confusing your name.

1080
00:47:35,727 --> 00:47:37,354
-With this?
-Go down that way.

1081
00:47:37,437 --> 00:47:38,313
THIS WAY

1082
00:47:38,397 --> 00:47:39,523
And…

1083
00:47:39,606 --> 00:47:40,983
If you don't fall asleep quickly,

1084
00:47:41,066 --> 00:47:42,734
you have to wake that person up.

1085
00:47:42,818 --> 00:47:43,902
"Excuse me."

1086
00:47:44,570 --> 00:47:45,571
"I have to get down."

1087
00:47:45,654 --> 00:47:46,738
NUISANCE TO THE BOTTOM BUNK

1088
00:47:46,822 --> 00:47:47,656
Come on!

1089
00:47:49,241 --> 00:47:50,075
Hold on.

1090
00:47:50,158 --> 00:47:51,660
How do we get down?

1091
00:47:52,536 --> 00:47:53,370
Let me see.

1092
00:47:55,414 --> 00:47:58,083
I can't see how I can get down from here!

1093
00:47:58,750 --> 00:48:00,085
Is there a ladder here too?

1094
00:48:01,753 --> 00:48:03,130
-It's too scary.
-I mean… Hold on.

1095
00:48:03,213 --> 00:48:04,881
Seriously, it's too scary!

1096
00:48:05,257 --> 00:48:07,467
OVERFLOWING WITH DOPAMINE A THIRD TIME

1097
00:48:08,385 --> 00:48:09,886
How do I get down? Hold on.

1098
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:12,556
Kian84, you…

1099
00:48:13,557 --> 00:48:15,350
-Geez, Kian84.
-Wait.

1100
00:48:19,938 --> 00:48:21,273
He's going to die from laughing…

1101
00:48:21,356 --> 00:48:23,066
Wait. Geez.

1102
00:48:26,486 --> 00:48:29,197
My hands can't reach the rung, you fool!

1103
00:48:30,949 --> 00:48:32,075
What do you mean?

1104
00:48:33,452 --> 00:48:34,661
What is it? Be careful.

1105
00:48:34,745 --> 00:48:36,872
-Be careful when you go down.
-The ladder…

1106
00:48:36,955 --> 00:48:39,291
-My hands can't reach!
-Right, so be careful.

1107
00:48:39,374 --> 00:48:40,792
Wait. I'm getting a cramp.

1108
00:48:40,876 --> 00:48:43,462
You can get down if you go carefully.

1109
00:48:46,131 --> 00:48:47,883
Hold on. I'm going to get down.

1110
00:48:52,929 --> 00:48:54,681
SHAKING

1111
00:48:57,017 --> 00:48:58,769
-How are we supposed to get down?
-What?

1112
00:48:59,436 --> 00:49:01,021
-Hold on.
-How do we get down?

1113
00:49:01,104 --> 00:49:02,814
Like this? Geez.

1114
00:49:02,898 --> 00:49:03,732
Hey, Ye-eun.

1115
00:49:04,399 --> 00:49:05,275
How do we…

1116
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:06,985
I don't think we can sleep here.

1117
00:49:07,694 --> 00:49:09,863
REALISTIC WAY OF THINKING

1118
00:49:09,946 --> 00:49:11,239
That spot has no window…

1119
00:49:12,407 --> 00:49:14,117
We don't need windows.

1120
00:49:14,201 --> 00:49:15,619
We're outside anyway.

1121
00:49:16,328 --> 00:49:18,163
KIAN'S WAY OF THINKING

1122
00:49:18,246 --> 00:49:20,582
Where do I unpack my stuff?
On the first floor?

1123
00:49:20,666 --> 00:49:21,541
Your stuff…

1124
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:24,127
I said you have to put it
in these cabinets after unpacking.

1125
00:49:24,211 --> 00:49:27,214
No, it's too hot here!
I can't put my stuff in them.

1126
00:49:27,297 --> 00:49:29,549
My facial cleanser will melt.

1127
00:49:29,633 --> 00:49:32,761
It's not just your stuff that'll melt.
You'll melt too, so it's fine.

1128
00:49:33,095 --> 00:49:35,013
KIAN'S PHILOSOPHY
THERE SHALL BE NO PROBLEM

1129
00:49:35,097 --> 00:49:37,015
IF YOU AND YOUR BELONGINGS ARE BOTH HOT

1130
00:49:37,099 --> 00:49:38,475
-Geez.
-Damn it.

1131
00:49:38,558 --> 00:49:41,311
Seriously. This is unbelievable.

1132
00:49:42,604 --> 00:49:43,605
What on earth?

1133
00:49:43,689 --> 00:49:44,815
There's water dripping here.

1134
00:49:45,732 --> 00:49:46,566
Water?

1135
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:49,820
Since it's hot, wash your face.

1136
00:49:50,487 --> 00:49:52,280
DUMBFOUNDED

1137
00:49:52,364 --> 00:49:54,074
I like this spot though. I'll take it.

1138
00:49:54,157 --> 00:49:55,409
I'll sleep like this.

1139
00:49:57,786 --> 00:49:59,621
We're able to talk pretty well here.

1140
00:50:00,497 --> 00:50:02,999
We can talk with the guests.

1141
00:50:03,667 --> 00:50:04,793
They built this well.

1142
00:50:04,876 --> 00:50:06,002
THE ARCHITECT IS VERY HAPPY

1143
00:50:07,504 --> 00:50:09,131
BLOCKS OUT

1144
00:50:09,214 --> 00:50:10,799
-Hey, Boss.
-Yes?

1145
00:50:10,882 --> 00:50:13,135
Any thoughts on changing the entrance?

1146
00:50:13,218 --> 00:50:14,886
No, we can't do that.

1147
00:50:14,970 --> 00:50:16,513
-Please maintain our rule.
-Then…

1148
00:50:16,596 --> 00:50:18,849
Let's block the entrance
in front of the slide.

1149
00:50:18,932 --> 00:50:20,517
Then, we really won't be able to go up.

1150
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:22,811
We'll need to set penalties
for using the slides.

1151
00:50:22,894 --> 00:50:24,438
You'll be penalized if you use them.

1152
00:50:25,814 --> 00:50:26,815
I really can't climb up.

1153
00:50:26,898 --> 00:50:28,108
THE SLIDE USER IS DISAPPOINTED

1154
00:50:28,191 --> 00:50:29,234
What am I going to do?

1155
00:50:30,652 --> 00:50:32,404
This is the area for having tea?

1156
00:50:33,113 --> 00:50:34,114
Where?

1157
00:50:34,865 --> 00:50:36,158
Okay, let's take a look.

1158
00:50:36,241 --> 00:50:37,701
Let's see. What?

1159
00:50:37,784 --> 00:50:39,286
-What is this?
-This is…

1160
00:50:42,247 --> 00:50:44,750
TEATIME ZONE

1161
00:50:44,833 --> 00:50:47,085
THEY MUST STICK THEIR FACES OUT
AND LOOK AT EACH OTHER

1162
00:50:52,507 --> 00:50:54,176
-What is this?
-This is…

1163
00:50:55,302 --> 00:50:56,178
How do you drink tea?

1164
00:50:56,261 --> 00:50:58,138
-Like this?
-That's right.

1165
00:50:58,221 --> 00:50:59,556
If you sit like this…

1166
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:02,267
Usually,

1167
00:51:02,350 --> 00:51:04,186
we share coffee
while looking at our phones.

1168
00:51:04,269 --> 00:51:06,563
-This is uncomfortable.
-How can you drink like this?

1169
00:51:06,646 --> 00:51:08,023
But if we sit like this,

1170
00:51:08,815 --> 00:51:10,066
we can see each other's faces.

1171
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:11,902
You can focus on looking
at each other more.

1172
00:51:11,985 --> 00:51:14,362
KIAN'S PHILOSOPHY
BEAR SOME DISCOMFORT TO SEE EACH OTHER

1173
00:51:14,446 --> 00:51:16,740
What if we spill our tea
because of these shaky tables?

1174
00:51:16,823 --> 00:51:18,408
-What?
-What if we spill our coffee?

1175
00:51:18,492 --> 00:51:19,326
The coffee?

1176
00:51:19,409 --> 00:51:21,912
If you spill your coffee,

1177
00:51:21,995 --> 00:51:24,831
we can chat while cleaning it up together.

1178
00:51:24,915 --> 00:51:26,750
Okay, let's check out the dining room.

1179
00:51:26,833 --> 00:51:28,585
-The dining room.
-That's a bit of an issue.

1180
00:51:29,336 --> 00:51:30,337
The dining room is… Okay.

1181
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:31,254
Open it up.

1182
00:51:34,007 --> 00:51:35,675
Hold on, this is kind of scary.

1183
00:51:35,759 --> 00:51:37,260
This is too scary!

1184
00:51:37,344 --> 00:51:38,595
Even I can't get up on this.

1185
00:51:38,678 --> 00:51:41,306
It's too high! What do we do?

1186
00:51:43,225 --> 00:51:45,310
This is how we'll get down.

1187
00:51:45,977 --> 00:51:47,437
You ride the pole down.

1188
00:51:48,021 --> 00:51:49,773
RIDE THE POLE FROM THE SECOND FLOOR

1189
00:51:49,856 --> 00:51:51,525
DOWN TO THE FIRST FLOOR TO FIND

1190
00:51:53,735 --> 00:51:55,570
THE DINING ROOM

1191
00:51:56,822 --> 00:51:59,241
RECOGNIZED AS THE TOUGHEST OBSTACLE
IN THIS HOUSE

1192
00:52:00,242 --> 00:52:03,161
THE POLE

1193
00:52:13,964 --> 00:52:15,006
Hold on, I'm scared too.

1194
00:52:15,090 --> 00:52:16,716
But if you become hungry,

1195
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:19,469
you'll have to withstand
either your hunger or fear.

1196
00:52:19,553 --> 00:52:21,721
There will be a time
when you'll have to make a choice.

1197
00:52:25,141 --> 00:52:26,226
Wait, this is too scary.

1198
00:52:26,309 --> 00:52:27,602
Can we even go up?

1199
00:52:28,436 --> 00:52:29,896
-Move.
-Come back up.

1200
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:31,064
-What?
-Come back up.

1201
00:52:31,147 --> 00:52:32,065
Yeah, climb back up.

1202
00:52:35,235 --> 00:52:37,946
This is hard for even a guy to do!

1203
00:52:38,321 --> 00:52:40,615
STRUGGLING WITH ALL HIS MIGHT

1204
00:52:40,699 --> 00:52:41,741
Are you kidding me?

1205
00:52:42,492 --> 00:52:43,618
Can you even climb up?

1206
00:52:43,702 --> 00:52:44,703
I can't go down on this.

1207
00:52:47,247 --> 00:52:48,582
It works if you use your knees.

1208
00:52:50,876 --> 00:52:52,085
It's like you're pole dancing.

1209
00:52:54,504 --> 00:52:55,881
Want me to grab your hand?

1210
00:52:55,964 --> 00:52:57,340
Want me to grab your hand?

1211
00:52:57,883 --> 00:52:59,551
-Want me to grab your hand?
-No. Wait.

1212
00:52:59,634 --> 00:53:01,094
-Even that won't work.
-I'm so tired.

1213
00:53:01,177 --> 00:53:02,804
See? He can't come up!

1214
00:53:03,930 --> 00:53:06,224
Try coming down. I'll catch you.

1215
00:53:06,308 --> 00:53:07,934
No, you come up first.

1216
00:53:08,018 --> 00:53:10,103
What? I don't think I can.

1217
00:53:10,854 --> 00:53:12,564
You come down first.

1218
00:53:12,647 --> 00:53:14,524
-I can't go down.
-If we go down…

1219
00:53:15,025 --> 00:53:16,276
We can't come back up!

1220
00:53:16,359 --> 00:53:19,112
If we carry each other on our shoulders,
one of us can get back up.

1221
00:53:19,195 --> 00:53:21,907
-Seriously, I'd just fall.
-You can't look down.

1222
00:53:21,990 --> 00:53:23,783
Then, the two of us
will catch you down here.

1223
00:53:23,867 --> 00:53:25,911
-You can't look down.
-You can't catch me.

1224
00:53:25,994 --> 00:53:27,287
Well, that's…

1225
00:53:29,164 --> 00:53:30,540
You're doing well, Jin!

1226
00:53:30,624 --> 00:53:31,458
Goodness.

1227
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:34,252
Hey, how do we get back up now?

1228
00:53:34,336 --> 00:53:35,503
2.2 METERS LONG

1229
00:53:35,587 --> 00:53:37,505
I can't do this!

1230
00:53:37,589 --> 00:53:40,342
Ye-eun, you have to get used to it.
We can only eat in here.

1231
00:53:40,425 --> 00:53:41,676
I have my socks on.

1232
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:43,219
OKAY, LET'S DO IT

1233
00:53:43,303 --> 00:53:44,930
NO, I CAN'T DO IT

1234
00:53:45,013 --> 00:53:47,307
-Am I going to make it?
-Want us to catch you?

1235
00:53:47,933 --> 00:53:50,185
Just grab the pole tight.
You'll come down naturally.

1236
00:53:50,268 --> 00:53:51,269
Hold on tight.

1237
00:53:51,353 --> 00:53:52,395
-Here I come!
-Okay.

1238
00:53:52,479 --> 00:53:53,605
I'm going for real.

1239
00:53:54,230 --> 00:53:55,190
NO, I CAN'T GO

1240
00:53:55,273 --> 00:53:56,524
Don't slip and fall. Come on.

1241
00:53:56,608 --> 00:53:58,193
Help me!

1242
00:53:59,235 --> 00:54:00,695
Okay, it's time to eat.

1243
00:54:00,779 --> 00:54:02,113
Just come down first.

1244
00:54:02,739 --> 00:54:04,240
Seriously, I can't do this!

1245
00:54:04,324 --> 00:54:06,159
I can't do it!

1246
00:54:06,242 --> 00:54:08,370
How am I supposed to do this?

1247
00:54:08,453 --> 00:54:09,829
Are you insane?

1248
00:54:09,913 --> 00:54:11,539
How can you design it like this?

1249
00:54:11,623 --> 00:54:12,707
Seriously!

1250
00:54:12,791 --> 00:54:14,084
-Wait.
-I mean…

1251
00:54:14,167 --> 00:54:17,170
I didn't like having people
go to the dining room so easily…

1252
00:54:17,253 --> 00:54:20,048
-This is too much!
-I didn't want them get there so easily.

1253
00:54:20,131 --> 00:54:22,801
Seriously, you've gone too far!

1254
00:54:22,884 --> 00:54:25,470
-I didn't like having them go so easily.
-This is so…

1255
00:54:25,553 --> 00:54:27,430
No matter how much you dislike it, still…

1256
00:54:28,139 --> 00:54:30,141
How could he even think of that?

1257
00:54:30,225 --> 00:54:31,935
It's like he's from a different world.

1258
00:54:32,018 --> 00:54:33,853
What on earth was he thinking?

1259
00:54:34,396 --> 00:54:35,397
But that pole…

1260
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:37,399
I really wanted to go down.

1261
00:54:37,482 --> 00:54:39,234
I wasn't pretending to be weak.

1262
00:54:39,317 --> 00:54:40,944
I really was scared.

1263
00:54:41,027 --> 00:54:42,529
Hey, just come down first.

1264
00:54:42,612 --> 00:54:44,114
I said I can't!

1265
00:54:45,031 --> 00:54:46,282
Hold onto the pole tight.

1266
00:54:48,118 --> 00:54:50,078
I'll carry you on my shoulders.

1267
00:54:50,161 --> 00:54:51,079
I'm too heavy.

1268
00:54:51,162 --> 00:54:52,205
IDEA 1
CARRY ON SHOULDERS

1269
00:54:54,416 --> 00:54:55,375
I have a great idea.

1270
00:54:55,458 --> 00:54:57,627
-I'll carry you on my shoulders.
-Okay.

1271
00:54:57,711 --> 00:54:59,045
And then, she can sit on yours.

1272
00:54:59,129 --> 00:55:00,463
I'm about 80kg. Is that okay?

1273
00:55:00,547 --> 00:55:02,048
Yes, I'll be fine if I hold the pole.

1274
00:55:02,132 --> 00:55:03,216
We'll be too heavy.

1275
00:55:03,299 --> 00:55:04,926
-Let's try.
-It'll be really heavy.

1276
00:55:05,010 --> 00:55:06,052
I'm quite heavy.

1277
00:55:06,136 --> 00:55:06,970
I weigh 80kg.

1278
00:55:08,471 --> 00:55:09,431
Let's go to this side.

1279
00:55:09,514 --> 00:55:10,849
ASSEMBLE

1280
00:55:10,932 --> 00:55:13,476
-Stand up. Okay. A bit to this side.
-Okay. To this side?

1281
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:14,561
I'll be too heavy.

1282
00:55:14,644 --> 00:55:15,562
-Get on.
-Just hurry!

1283
00:55:15,645 --> 00:55:16,896
-Hurry and get on!
-I did.

1284
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:18,523
-Get on him!
-I did!

1285
00:55:18,606 --> 00:55:19,816
-Get on!
-Now, go slow.

1286
00:55:19,899 --> 00:55:21,026
Wait. Go back up!

1287
00:55:21,109 --> 00:55:23,278
-Why?
-Keep going up! Hold on. Just go up.

1288
00:55:23,361 --> 00:55:24,821
-Okay, she's on!
-Go down?

1289
00:55:24,904 --> 00:55:25,905
-Go down!
-Go down?

1290
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:28,116
-You should move! Step away.
-Should I move?

1291
00:55:28,199 --> 00:55:29,868
You said to get out!

1292
00:55:29,951 --> 00:55:31,786
Move out of the way.

1293
00:55:31,870 --> 00:55:34,080
IT'S TOO SCARY

1294
00:55:34,164 --> 00:55:35,915
IT'S TOO HEAVY

1295
00:55:35,999 --> 00:55:36,958
Move out of the way.

1296
00:55:37,042 --> 00:55:38,168
-Hold on!
-We got it.

1297
00:55:38,251 --> 00:55:40,211
We got it. My goodness.

1298
00:55:41,004 --> 00:55:42,422
-Move out of the way.
-Hold on!

1299
00:55:42,505 --> 00:55:43,339
We got it.

1300
00:55:43,423 --> 00:55:45,300
We got it. My goodness.

1301
00:55:45,383 --> 00:55:46,843
Geez, we barely got her down.

1302
00:55:48,094 --> 00:55:49,387
Hey, Kian!

1303
00:55:49,471 --> 00:55:52,223
How do you expect me to move
if you squeeze like this?

1304
00:55:52,307 --> 00:55:53,433
Move out of the way.

1305
00:55:53,516 --> 00:55:54,601
SQUEEZING TIGHT

1306
00:55:54,684 --> 00:55:56,352
Should I move?

1307
00:55:56,436 --> 00:55:57,604
You said to get out!

1308
00:55:58,146 --> 00:55:59,272
We almost all died.

1309
00:55:59,355 --> 00:56:00,982
Still, you made it down.

1310
00:56:01,066 --> 00:56:02,192
I made it down!

1311
00:56:02,275 --> 00:56:03,318
Yeah, you did.

1312
00:56:03,401 --> 00:56:04,819
IN ANY CASE,
THEY DID IT

1313
00:56:04,903 --> 00:56:06,654
I wonder how the guests will react.

1314
00:56:06,738 --> 00:56:09,407
Our show's become
another version of Physical: 100.

1315
00:56:10,366 --> 00:56:13,244
AFTEREFFECTS OF PARTICIPATING
IN PHYSICAL: 84

1316
00:56:13,328 --> 00:56:16,706
THE GUESTS WHO AREN'T EXPECTING
PHYSICAL: 84

1317
00:56:16,790 --> 00:56:20,210
JUN-HEE, SEONG-EUN, SUNG-HO,
KI-HONG, GA-HYUN

1318
00:56:20,293 --> 00:56:22,253
-We're going to an island called Jukdo.
-Okay.

1319
00:56:22,337 --> 00:56:24,631
It's about 30 minutes to Jukdo from here.

1320
00:56:24,714 --> 00:56:27,217
There's a lot of fish near Jukdo.

1321
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:29,135
-And the waters are so clear.
-I love it.

1322
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:32,889
A SMALL ISLAND NEAR ULLEUNGDO
WITH COOL, CLEAR WATERS

1323
00:56:34,891 --> 00:56:37,477
Enjoy! Have fun!

1324
00:56:43,274 --> 00:56:44,901
ARRIVES AT JUKDO

1325
00:56:44,984 --> 00:56:47,153
We're going to dive here,
so you can get ready.

1326
00:56:47,237 --> 00:56:48,238
Have fun!

1327
00:57:02,377 --> 00:57:05,839
GETTING READY TO GO INTO DEEPER WATERS

1328
00:57:20,812 --> 00:57:23,440
MEANWHILE, THE KAIST GUYS

1329
00:57:24,149 --> 00:57:28,736
HAKPO PORT, A POPULAR SPOT FOR SNORKELING

1330
00:57:43,293 --> 00:57:45,962
JEODONG PORT

1331
00:57:46,379 --> 00:57:47,922
GA-HYUN IS FISHING ON ULLEUNGDO

1332
00:57:48,006 --> 00:57:48,882
Come on and bite.

1333
00:57:51,217 --> 00:57:52,844
I'm going to catch one no matter what.

1334
00:57:53,887 --> 00:57:57,557
SHE CATCHES A ROCK BREAM

1335
00:57:58,975 --> 00:58:01,561
Nice! I'm going to show it off to my dad.

1336
00:58:03,313 --> 00:58:04,647
I've thought about it,

1337
00:58:04,731 --> 00:58:07,358
and I'm sure
everyone will be here in the evening.

1338
00:58:07,442 --> 00:58:09,319
So instead of breakfast,

1339
00:58:09,402 --> 00:58:11,529
let's serve them dinner every night.

1340
00:58:11,613 --> 00:58:13,656
-That would be better.
-Right?

1341
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:15,617
-Instead of breakfast.
-What about breakfast?

1342
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:17,827
We'll tell them
to take care of that on their own.

1343
00:58:18,828 --> 00:58:20,246
What do we do now?

1344
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:22,123
Let's go out and bring in our stuff.

1345
00:58:23,041 --> 00:58:24,792
Let's try lifting each other to go out.

1346
00:58:24,876 --> 00:58:28,046
But I can't keep being the only one
who sits on your shoulders.

1347
00:58:28,129 --> 00:58:29,422
We'll boost you up by your feet.

1348
00:58:29,506 --> 00:58:31,466
We'll hold your feet like this.

1349
00:58:32,217 --> 00:58:33,843
-And you'll grab the pole.
-Okay.

1350
00:58:33,927 --> 00:58:35,803
Then, we'll lift you up.

1351
00:58:35,887 --> 00:58:36,971
That will never work.

1352
00:58:37,055 --> 00:58:39,974
It will. You just have to stand
and hold onto the pole.

1353
00:58:40,058 --> 00:58:41,976
But I'm afraid she'll let go.
If she does, then…

1354
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:43,436
I'm sure she'll hold on.

1355
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:44,771
She's not a fool.

1356
00:58:44,854 --> 00:58:47,315
The thought crossed my mind
that she could be.

1357
00:58:47,398 --> 00:58:48,608
Honestly, I am a fool.

1358
00:58:50,610 --> 00:58:52,862
Should I just try to go out that way?

1359
00:58:55,657 --> 00:58:57,033
I don't think I can though.

1360
00:58:57,116 --> 00:58:58,826
OF COURSE NOT

1361
00:58:58,910 --> 00:59:01,871
A TINY WINDOW THAT'S 30CM TALL

1362
00:59:02,622 --> 00:59:04,082
REALIZES THE REALITY

1363
00:59:04,165 --> 00:59:05,875
Geez, Kian84!

1364
00:59:05,959 --> 00:59:08,169
You can go out that way.
And then, you can help us out.

1365
00:59:08,253 --> 00:59:09,879
YOUR PAIN IS MY JOY

1366
00:59:11,089 --> 00:59:12,632
I don't think I can go up.

1367
00:59:13,216 --> 00:59:15,051
You have to put your feet together.

1368
00:59:15,134 --> 00:59:17,136
-Like this.
-It won't work because of her socks.

1369
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:18,721
-Take off your socks.
-Take them off?

1370
00:59:18,805 --> 00:59:21,140
-Throw them up there.
-I don't think this will help.

1371
00:59:21,224 --> 00:59:23,726
-It don't think it'll help.
-Just toss them up there.

1372
00:59:26,312 --> 00:59:27,981
-You don't have muscle strength.
-I don't.

1373
00:59:28,064 --> 00:59:29,023
Put your feet together.

1374
00:59:29,107 --> 00:59:31,401
-One, two.
-I can't put them together.

1375
00:59:34,153 --> 00:59:35,822
-Step on me.
-I'm really going to do it.

1376
00:59:35,905 --> 00:59:37,198
-Step on me.
-Go ahead.

1377
00:59:37,740 --> 00:59:39,158
-Don't let go of the pole!
-Grab it.

1378
00:59:39,242 --> 00:59:41,452
-Stand up.
-Don't let go.

1379
00:59:41,536 --> 00:59:43,413
-I won't.
-Stand up. There you go.

1380
00:59:44,205 --> 00:59:45,415
I can't let go. I can't go up.

1381
00:59:45,498 --> 00:59:46,374
-You can't?
-I can't.

1382
00:59:46,457 --> 00:59:47,458
You can't? Sit back down.

1383
00:59:47,542 --> 00:59:49,335
-Sit down. Wait.
-Wait, don't let go.

1384
00:59:49,419 --> 00:59:50,837
Not you. Hold on.

1385
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:53,131
SUCCESSFULLY PUTS HER FEET TOGETHER

1386
00:59:53,214 --> 00:59:55,717
It's okay. Let go. It's not that high.

1387
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:58,011
-There you go. Coming down's easy, right?
-Ye-eun.

1388
00:59:58,094 --> 01:00:00,221
You stay here. We'll go out and come back.

1389
01:00:00,305 --> 01:00:01,598
All right.

1390
01:00:01,681 --> 01:00:03,057
No, she has to drive the boat.

1391
01:00:03,141 --> 01:00:04,309
-She has to go.
-You're right.

1392
01:00:04,392 --> 01:00:05,893
You have to drive the boat!

1393
01:00:07,478 --> 01:00:11,065
KIAN'S B&B ON THE SEA
ISOLATED WITHOUT A BOAT

1394
01:00:12,442 --> 01:00:16,237
SPECIAL MISSION
LIFT UP CAPTAIN JI

1395
01:00:16,321 --> 01:00:18,448
I don't have any strength in my hands.

1396
01:00:18,531 --> 01:00:20,366
-Don't give up. Focus.
-Yeah, you can do it.

1397
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:22,368
Ye-eun, focus.

1398
01:00:22,452 --> 01:00:24,287
Ye-eun, you can do it.

1399
01:00:24,370 --> 01:00:26,039
-Repeat after me. "I can."
-"I can."

1400
01:00:26,122 --> 01:00:26,956
"I can do it."

1401
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:27,957
-"I can do it."
-Focus.

1402
01:00:28,041 --> 01:00:29,792
-Use your strength to grab it.
-That's it.

1403
01:00:29,876 --> 01:00:30,960
-On rhythm, okay?
-Yes.

1404
01:00:31,044 --> 01:00:32,420
-Believe.
-That's right.

1405
01:00:32,503 --> 01:00:34,005
-Don't give up.
-I'm going insane.

1406
01:00:34,922 --> 01:00:36,674
-Okay. I can do this.
-One foot at a time.

1407
01:00:36,758 --> 01:00:37,759
Lift one foot at a time.

1408
01:00:39,969 --> 01:00:41,929
-There you go.
-My goodness!

1409
01:00:42,013 --> 01:00:44,432
-There you go. Don't bend your legs!
-That's it.

1410
01:00:44,515 --> 01:00:45,600
Don't bend your legs.

1411
01:00:45,683 --> 01:00:47,602
Hey! Don't bend your legs.

1412
01:00:47,685 --> 01:00:48,561
Keep them straight!

1413
01:00:48,645 --> 01:00:50,647
-Keep them straight. Not like that!
-Your legs.

1414
01:00:50,730 --> 01:00:52,273
-Grab it and go up.
-Hey, go up!

1415
01:00:52,357 --> 01:00:53,733
-Go up. Okay.
-Go up. There you go!

1416
01:00:53,816 --> 01:00:54,651
-Good job!
