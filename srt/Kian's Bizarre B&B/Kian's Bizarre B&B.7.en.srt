1
00:00:13,722 --> 00:00:15,932
-You guys work out, right?
-Should we go now?

2
00:00:16,015 --> 00:00:18,184
-Let's go work out.
-Sounds fun.

3
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:20,061
There's a sandbag over here too.

4
00:00:20,145 --> 00:00:20,979
ENTERING THE GYM

5
00:00:21,062 --> 00:00:22,605
Feel free to work out here.

6
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:24,858
How high can you go up on this thing?

7
00:00:26,943 --> 00:00:28,778
5-METER-HIGH ROPE

8
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:30,155
This rope?

9
00:00:30,238 --> 00:00:32,741
Let's all try it and see how we do.

10
00:00:32,824 --> 00:00:33,742
Sure.

11
00:00:39,581 --> 00:00:42,000
The athlete can go first.

12
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:44,169
SHY

13
00:00:44,252 --> 00:00:45,670
Can you please show us?

14
00:00:45,754 --> 00:00:47,380
I can probably get up if I use my feet.

15
00:00:47,464 --> 00:00:48,298
NOT CONFIDENT

16
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:50,425
-No feet allowed.
-That's the rule.

17
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:52,510
I'll give it a try.

18
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:55,930
WARMING UP HIS HANDS

19
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:57,223
I don't think I can do this.

20
00:01:08,818 --> 00:01:10,028
He's doing it.

21
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:13,156
HIS WORK PERSONA TAKES OVER

22
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:17,077
Awesome.

23
00:01:18,828 --> 00:01:19,996
How's he doing that?

24
00:01:23,833 --> 00:01:26,252
Dang, I can't go higher.

25
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:29,047
I'm amazed.

26
00:01:30,131 --> 00:01:33,301
Athletes are on a different level.

27
00:01:40,141 --> 00:01:41,059
That was so…

28
00:01:41,142 --> 00:01:43,520
BACK TO SHY MODE

29
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:46,272
I'm starting to feel competitive.

30
00:01:48,024 --> 00:01:49,359
Hold on, I want to try.

31
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:51,027
COMPETITIVE SPIRIT IS UP

32
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:52,195
We should sit and…

33
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:53,905
THE OWNER MAKES AN ATTEMPT

34
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:03,873
He's just hanging.

35
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:05,959
I definitely can't do this.

36
00:02:06,042 --> 00:02:08,169
STILL GIVES A ROUND OF APPLAUSE

37
00:02:08,753 --> 00:02:10,171
Who's next?

38
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:11,381
You've got this.

39
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:13,174
-Just a bit more!
-You can do it!

40
00:02:14,592 --> 00:02:15,927
-I can't do more.
-Next up.

41
00:02:17,178 --> 00:02:18,763
My arms refuse to move.

42
00:02:20,431 --> 00:02:22,016
What about you, Jin?

43
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,601
JIN'S TURN

44
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:25,812
I'm not good at stuff like this.

45
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:29,065
I don't think I can do this either.

46
00:02:32,443 --> 00:02:35,363
Damn, he's got this!

47
00:02:36,072 --> 00:02:37,574
Damn, he's got this!

48
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:39,534
Damn, he's got this!

49
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,036
-He's an elevator.
-Seriously?

50
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,997
-He's an elevator.
-Seriously?

51
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,427
He's showing his true strength.

52
00:02:58,177 --> 00:02:59,596
-Be careful!
-Are you okay?

53
00:03:00,096 --> 00:03:03,016
-I'm totally okay.
-But how did he even do that?

54
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:05,184
Do you know how to do joint locks?

55
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:07,145
-Yes, I like those.
-You do?

56
00:03:07,228 --> 00:03:10,565
-When it comes to joint locks…
-Our friend here learned jiujitsu.

57
00:03:10,648 --> 00:03:12,901
-You learned jiujitsu?
-Yes.

58
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:16,404
JOINT LOCK LESSON

59
00:03:16,487 --> 00:03:18,781
Go around like this
and grab him from behind.

60
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:20,575
Then, take him down.

61
00:03:20,658 --> 00:03:22,952
-He's down.
-You have to get up.

62
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:25,413
From here, you can do this.

63
00:03:25,496 --> 00:03:27,582
Put your elbow under his chin.

64
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:30,084
Tap out before three seconds.

65
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:31,836
One, two, three.

66
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,547
TAPS OUT IN 1 SECOND

67
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,549
You need to take turns.

68
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:37,884
Show us some jiujitsu.

69
00:03:37,967 --> 00:03:39,385
Show us your main move.

70
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:41,304
This wasn't my intention.

71
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:43,932
-This isn't what I envisioned.
-He has a thick body.

72
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:44,891
His move won't work.

73
00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:46,726
-I'll give it a try.
-Make sure to tap out.

74
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:51,272
ALSO TAPS OUT IN 1 SECOND

75
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:53,566
Can't you get out of a chokehold?

76
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,068
Not when it's executed perfectly.

77
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:56,778
You should experience it firsthand.

78
00:03:56,861 --> 00:03:58,029
No, that's okay.

79
00:03:58,112 --> 00:04:01,574
-That's not a bad idea.
-Do you want to try it on me?

80
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:03,326
-It's an honor.
-Sure thing.

81
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:05,578
I'll let BTS put me in a chokehold.

82
00:04:06,287 --> 00:04:07,872
-Get behind him.
-Like this?

83
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:09,958
-I put my legs around like this.
-That's it.

84
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:11,834
-My arms go here.
-Put one on his neck.

85
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:14,045
Raise it more. That's it.

86
00:04:14,128 --> 00:04:15,088
Like this?

87
00:04:15,171 --> 00:04:16,965
One, two, three, choke.

88
00:04:19,133 --> 00:04:21,886
-I think you should tighten it more.
-Really?

89
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:24,305
It's good.

90
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:25,848
-It was an honor.
-Not at all.

91
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:27,308
Why don't you try it too?

92
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:29,560
-I wouldn't if I were you.
-No, Chang-jun.

93
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:31,187
-Farewell.
-It was nice knowing you.

94
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:34,482
It's okay. Try it out.
We're supposed to take turns.

95
00:04:34,565 --> 00:04:36,317
-Try it on me.
-Okay.

96
00:04:36,859 --> 00:04:38,069
I'll put you in a hold first.

97
00:04:38,152 --> 00:04:40,488
I'll go slowly,
so tap out if you can't breathe.

98
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:45,785
-You crazy bastard!
-I'm sorry!

99
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:49,497
I'm joking. Get up.

100
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:52,667
Seriously, it's fine.

101
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,752
-Who are you?
-Go away!

102
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:58,840
You're such a jerk!

103
00:04:58,923 --> 00:05:00,550
No, it's okay!

104
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:04,804
He's really good. He got me in one second.

105
00:05:04,887 --> 00:05:06,973
-It's good to sweat.
-Go wash up already.

106
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:09,350
I should turn off the lights.

107
00:05:10,059 --> 00:05:11,853
This is a nice vibe.

108
00:05:11,936 --> 00:05:13,688
I also got some beer earlier.

109
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:15,857
-You can help yourselves to it.
-Sure.

110
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:18,651
If there aren't any snacks to go with it,
just sniff your hand.

111
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:21,738
KIAN-STYLE THINKING:
PAIR YOUR DRINK WITH YOUR SMELLY HAND

112
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:24,407
I actually smell jjajang
whenever I do this.

113
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,451
I smell it too.

114
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:28,328
-I smell it too.
-You're right.

115
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:30,997
-It really does smell.
-I smell it too.

116
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,916
ADDICTED TO THE SMELL OF THEIR HANDS

117
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,752
Should I bring some beer then?

118
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:37,295
-I'll go get it.
-We'll help.

119
00:05:37,378 --> 00:05:39,255
-You should rest here.
-No, it's okay.

120
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:40,506
No, you're guests.

121
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,051
Safe trip.

122
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,595
Gosh, I'm tired.

123
00:05:47,972 --> 00:05:49,515
-How many people are we?
-Seven.

124
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:53,436
THE OWNER GRABS THE BEER

125
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:55,897
YE-EUN GOES TO WASH UP

126
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:56,939
Oh my.

127
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:01,027
-Cheers. It's nice to meet everyone.
-Nice to meet you.

128
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:02,945
-Thanks for today.
-It was fun.

129
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:04,238
We look forward to our stay.

130
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:06,407
-Tell us about yourselves.
-Sure.

131
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:08,451
What made you come on this trip?

132
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:09,952
Right, I'm curious too.

133
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:14,248
We thought about how
if we hit our thirties and start working,

134
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:16,584
it'd be hard to find time
to travel together.

135
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:17,919
It's harder the older you get.

136
00:06:18,002 --> 00:06:19,921
We're all unemployed,

137
00:06:20,004 --> 00:06:23,466
so we thought
this could be our last memory together.

138
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:25,468
How hard do you plan on working?

139
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:26,844
How old are you now?

140
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:28,429
-I'm 27.
-If you're 27…

141
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:32,016
-If you're 27…
-Jeez, 27 years old…

142
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,310
I think that was
the hardest year of my life.

143
00:06:35,186 --> 00:06:37,772
Every time I applied to Naver,
they rejected me.

144
00:06:37,855 --> 00:06:39,232
I tried four times.

145
00:06:40,691 --> 00:06:43,778
I almost lost my mind
because nothing worked out.

146
00:06:43,861 --> 00:06:45,113
If I failed at this,

147
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:48,074
everything I had worked for
would be for nothing.

148
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:51,702
I needed money so I worked part-time.

149
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:55,248
Taught at an art academy
to prep students for college.

150
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:57,667
I also taught art classes for kids
in the afternoon.

151
00:06:58,251 --> 00:06:59,418
I even drove them home.

152
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:03,297
-You've lived a busy life.
-"Kids, hurry and get on the bus."

153
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,091
You worked really hard.

154
00:07:05,174 --> 00:07:07,885
I'm sure it's like that
for everyone though.

155
00:07:10,304 --> 00:07:12,557
How long have you lived in South Korea?

156
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,225
It's been 15 years.

157
00:07:14,308 --> 00:07:17,937
Do you think the North Korean regime…

158
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:18,938
NORTH KOREA?

159
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:20,022
…will continue?

160
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:22,859
It'll be fine
while Jong Un is still in power.

161
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:24,861
DURING DINNERTIME

162
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:26,487
I majored in civil engineering.

163
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:28,239
I majored in economics.

164
00:07:30,366 --> 00:07:32,076
May I ask what you studied?

165
00:07:35,496 --> 00:07:36,914
I'm a North Korean defector.

166
00:07:38,332 --> 00:07:39,750
What? Could you repeat that?

167
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:44,505
I got captured once
before finally escaping.

168
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:48,134
It's just been me and my younger sister
since I was 12.

169
00:07:48,217 --> 00:07:51,345
I was never really good
at taking care of her,

170
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:54,098
but if I were to defect,
she'd be left on her own.

171
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:55,766
I'm not the best older brother,

172
00:07:55,850 --> 00:08:00,021
but with me around, people would
think twice about harming her.

173
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:05,318
So I persuaded her,
and we left at dawn on February 28th.

174
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:07,278
We crossed the border on March 1st.

175
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:10,865
You said you got captured once
while crossing.

176
00:08:10,948 --> 00:08:13,659
Were you taken to a prison camp?

177
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:15,661
I was sent
to the military inspection division.

178
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:17,413
They beat me a lot there.

179
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,334
After getting beaten,

180
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:24,504
I'd get chills whenever I saw anyone
wearing combat uniforms.

181
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:29,050
Recently, I got a tattoo on my back

182
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:30,885
that says "The Great Escape"

183
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:33,179
because I made a great escape
from up there.

184
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:36,015
The dates and everything
all carry meaning.

185
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:40,811
I'm the same age as Kim Jong Un.

186
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:45,900
And recently, I went to Harlem
and rapped with some Black people.

187
00:08:47,151 --> 00:08:48,027
YO, SHAKE IT

188
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:50,696
I'm from South Korea

189
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:54,534
Jong Un has nuclear bombs
But we have Samsung down here

190
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:56,452
That's where I'm from, yeah!

191
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,829
Jong Un is my age, so we're friends

192
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:01,624
Jong Un 84 and Kian84

193
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:03,084
AMAZING

194
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:07,713
Wait, if this segment airs,
will I get in trouble?

195
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:10,174
Okay, everyone.

196
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:13,261
Let's clean this up and go to sleep.

197
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:15,012
Yes, let's go to bed.

198
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:16,722
Are you going down?

199
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:17,723
It's so pretty.

200
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:18,808
-Right?
-Yes.

201
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:22,979
The weather was supposed to be good,
so I'd planned on taking us out,

202
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:25,565
but since we didn't today,
we'll head out tomorrow.

203
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:29,485
My plan was to look at the moon
while going to sleep,

204
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:32,321
but I haven't seen the moon yet.

205
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:34,073
Good night.

206
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:49,922
DAY 6
6 A.M.

207
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:52,758
AS ALWAYS, YE-EUN IS THE FIRST TO WAKE UP

208
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:54,885
HALF-ASLEEP

209
00:09:57,179 --> 00:09:59,849
-You're going to Dokdo today, right?
-That's right.

210
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:02,018
-I'll take you there.
-Thank you.

211
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:04,395
-Have a great time there.
-I will.

212
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:07,189
CAPTAIN JI SETS OFF

213
00:10:10,651 --> 00:10:12,111
You must be exhausted because of me.

214
00:10:12,194 --> 00:10:13,821
-Bet you wanted more sleep.
-Not at all.

215
00:10:13,904 --> 00:10:15,906
I wake up pretty early when I'm here.

216
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:21,120
I wake up really late at home,
but whenever I'm here, I'm up by 5:30 a.m.

217
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:24,665
It's even prettier from this angle.

218
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:27,043
-Isn't it though?
-Totally.

219
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:29,962
-It's such a nice view here.
-It really is.

220
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:32,882
-The mountains are gorgeous.
-Yes, the mountains and…

221
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:35,760
I'll see you later.

222
00:10:35,843 --> 00:10:37,219
-Have fun.
-Thank you.

223
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:49,440
JIN ALSO WAKES UP

224
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:54,654
THE OWNER IS AWAKE

225
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:05,122
My whole body is killing me.

226
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:09,210
SIDE EFFECT OF RUNNING KIAN'S B&B
FOR 6 DAYS

227
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:11,379
RUMMAGES

228
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:19,512
SQUEEZES TOOTHPASTE INTO HIS MOUTH

229
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:23,224
TIRED OR NOT, I NEED TO BRUSH MY TEETH

230
00:11:28,604 --> 00:11:29,772
The sky is clear.

231
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:35,194
I can't get used to this scenery.

232
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:38,072
It's too good to be true.

233
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:43,077
Why didn't we see this on our way here?

234
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:46,163
Who would look for a B&B
in the middle of the ocean?

235
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,335
HERE'S THE OWNER
WHO BUILT A B&B IN THE OCEAN

236
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:53,045
Kian, this place is amazing.

237
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:54,380
-Do you like it?
-Yes.

238
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:57,758
The weather is good today,
so we're going out to the sea.

239
00:11:57,842 --> 00:11:59,969
Really? That sounds fantastic.

240
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:01,971
KIAN'S B&B IS HERE

241
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:03,889
BUT IT WILL MOVE OVER HERE

242
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:05,433
What time will you be back?

243
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:08,853
If you come back by 5 p.m.,
we'll set up the pool.

244
00:12:08,936 --> 00:12:11,063
Would you like to play
in the pool with us?

245
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:12,606
-I'd like that.
-Sounds great.

246
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:13,858
We'll be back by 5 p.m.

247
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:16,360
Then we'll open the pool at 5 p.m.

248
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:18,654
Can you do me a favor?

249
00:12:18,737 --> 00:12:20,197
-There's a shoebox up there.
-Okay.

250
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:22,616
-Can you pass it down to me, please?
-Sure.

251
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:25,035
-Is this it?
-Yes.

252
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:26,454
-Just slide it down.
-Okay.

253
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:29,457
KIAN'S B&B DELIVERY SERVICE

254
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:33,878
KIAN-STYLE ART SUPPLY BAG

255
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:35,421

256
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:37,631
-When will you check out?
-On Tuesday.

257
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:38,632
-Tuesday?
-Yes.

258
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:41,427
KIAN'S B&B GUEST BOOK

259
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:43,262
He's writing our names.

260
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:46,891
CHUNG-IL, MYEONG-GYUN, JOHN,
CHANG-JUN, EUN-SIK

261
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:52,480
One, two, three, four, five…

262
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:54,899
Then 13, 14, 15, 16, 17.

263
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:57,193
KIAN'S B&B GUESTS
A TOTAL OF 17 SO FAR

264
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:03,532
PUTS HIS PAJAMAS IN HIS PANTS

265
00:13:10,998 --> 00:13:12,249
STRUGGLES

266
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:15,127
PUTS HIS ART SUPPLIES IN TOO

267
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:29,642
-Would you like some coffee?
-Yes.

268
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:30,935
I'd love that.

269
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:32,728
THE OWNER JUMPS INTO ACTION

270
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:35,231
CHANG-JUN FOLLOWS TO HELP HIM

271
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:38,400
Thank you.

272
00:13:43,113 --> 00:13:44,698
STARES

273
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:47,993
AWKWARD

274
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:50,496
What? Is something floating in it?

275
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:53,207
-Yes, but it's okay to--
-No, absolutely not.

276
00:13:53,707 --> 00:13:56,377
THE OWNER PANICS

277
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:01,632
CHECKS THE KETTLE AGAIN

278
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:04,426
Two of them were bigger than I expected.

279
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:08,931
You didn't need my permission
to get rid of them.

280
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:11,600
-You're surprisingly hygienic.
-Of course.

281
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:13,310
It's all a misunderstanding.

282
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:15,688
I'm almost germophobic.

283
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:17,314
I'm super clean.

284
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:23,404
I'm almost germophobic.

285
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:24,655
I'm super clean.

286
00:14:38,168 --> 00:14:39,712
Would you like some coffee?

287
00:14:39,795 --> 00:14:41,255
I'll pour you a cup.

288
00:14:46,093 --> 00:14:47,386
I smell instant coffee.

289
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:49,597
-Be careful. You might spill it.
-Thank you.

290
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:54,268
A LONG OVERDUE COFFEE BREAK

291
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,437
When are we heading out to sea?

292
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:59,273
The sun gets really bright
at around 2 p.m.

293
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:01,817
Why do my knees hurt?

294
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:04,528
My entire body ached
when I woke up this morning.

295
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:05,905
It hurts everywhere.

296
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:08,908
My back is killing me
because of this pole.

297
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:09,992
-This is the worst.
-Same.

298
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:12,661
HIGHEST LEVEL OF DIFFICULTY AT KIAN'S B&B

299
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:14,413
My forearms got bigger.

300
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:16,165
Touch it. It feels more muscular.

301
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:17,791
Right?

302
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:20,377
In six days, I got more muscular.

303
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:21,378
THE KIAN'S B&B EFFECT

304
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:24,298
-His arms were soft at first.
-They really were.

305
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:26,258
This is like a survival show.

306
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:28,677
No, this is a therapeutic show.

307
00:15:29,678 --> 00:15:31,972
How is this therapeutic?

308
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:34,350
All of this is for your mental therapy.

309
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:36,894
All of you are troubled
by something, right?

310
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:39,104
Just let it all out here.

311
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:43,442
We want to help
soothe and heal our guests.

312
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:49,114
THE OWNER'S CONVICTION:
KIAN'S B&B HEALS YOUR SOUL

313
00:15:49,698 --> 00:15:53,243
-I want to explore this island too.
-Same. I never got to look around.

314
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:55,663
Can we take a trip somewhere
just this once?

315
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:56,747
Can we really?

316
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:57,831
YES, PLEASE

317
00:15:57,915 --> 00:16:00,250
What about our guests?

318
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:02,127
Then you stay behind, Jin.

319
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:05,923
-Hey--
-You stay here, and we'll go have fun.

320
00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:11,178
We have to go out anyway
to pick up our guests at 5 p.m.,

321
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:12,846
so we do have some time.

322
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:15,224
-We do.
-We have about an hour.

323
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:17,893
-Boss, are you here to fool around?
-Can't we take a look around?

324
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:19,687
Can't we take a look around?

325
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:23,273
No, we're here to work.
These folks are here to look around.

326
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:24,942
We're not here to have fun.

327
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:27,820
That's true though.
We're not here to have fun.

328
00:16:29,863 --> 00:16:32,032
You always keep me grounded.

329
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:33,659
Seriously, Kian!

330
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:35,619
I really appreciate it.

331
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:40,040
-Without you, this pole wouldn't be here.
-That's right.

332
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:43,043
-And we'd have a door on the first floor.
-Exactly.

333
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:46,088
-We'd have a washing machine.
-No, that can't happen.

334
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:47,965
It wouldn't be Kian's B&B.

335
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:50,634
KIAN'S SPIRITUAL ANCHOR

336
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:52,344
They're unbelievable.

337
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:54,263
Why do you want to go out?

338
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:56,557
It'd be nice to explore
when the weather's good.

339
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,641
STARTS PERSUADING

340
00:16:57,725 --> 00:16:59,184
Let's have mulhoe for lunch then.

341
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:00,269
PERSUASION SUCCESSFUL

342
00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:02,521
Let's go out.

343
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:05,399
Wait, then…

344
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:09,820
The barge is moving.

345
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:11,739
What's going on?

346
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:13,824
KIAN'S B&B IS MOVING

347
00:17:17,953 --> 00:17:20,205
Where are you taking us?

348
00:17:20,956 --> 00:17:24,126
WE'RE GOING FAR OUT TO THE SEA

349
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:27,004
The B&B feels like Dokdo now.

350
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:28,756
There's nothing but the open sea.

351
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:30,841
ANCHORED IN THE DISTANT SEA

352
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:33,927
The waves are strong.

353
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:35,888
You can really feel the waves out here.

354
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:38,098
They're strong.

355
00:17:51,111 --> 00:17:52,696
STUMBLES HERE

356
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:55,657
STUMBLES THERE

357
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,160
Oh, jeez.

358
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:00,913
It's rocking too much.

359
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:09,338
THE OWNER TAKES SHELTER

360
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:12,424
All of this rocking is making me seasick.

361
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:15,385
THE OWNER IS NAUSEOUS

362
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:17,346
-Is anyone else seasick?
-Not yet.

363
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:18,889
-You're okay?
-Yes.

364
00:18:18,972 --> 00:18:21,058
Young people are so strong.

365
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:23,936
It's rocking a lot.

366
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:27,815
RESTLESS

367
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:33,487
Gosh, this is tough.

368
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:36,323
-Are you feeling nauseated?
-Yes.

369
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:39,576
Why would a person who gets seasick
come up with this idea?

370
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,203
He didn't know it'd be this bad.

371
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:43,956
"Turn the ship around.
We're heading to shore."

372
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:47,126
TIME TO HEAD TO SHORE

373
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:48,377
-Everyone here?
-Yes!

374
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:49,545
Let's go!

375
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:54,383
The staff will take the boat,
and the guests will take the banana boat.

376
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:56,135
BANANA BOAT?

377
00:18:57,052 --> 00:18:58,387
We're on a barge, right?

378
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:01,723
So when we go to land,

379
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:04,143
the banana boat
will serve as a shuttle bus.

380
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:07,938
KIAN'S IMAGINATION BECOMES REALITY

381
00:19:09,731 --> 00:19:11,650
-Jin.
-Yes?

382
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:15,988
Can you get on the banana boat
with the guests and look after them?

383
00:19:16,071 --> 00:19:17,197
You want me to get on it?

384
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:20,033
Yes, I'm sorry.
I'm too nauseous right now.

385
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:23,036
I'll sit in the front.

386
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,080
You two get in first.

387
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,748
BEGINS BOARDING THE BANANA BOAT

388
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:27,916
Put on your headgear.

389
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:32,296
-You have to get on first.
-We're putting our faith in you, Jin.

390
00:19:32,379 --> 00:19:34,339
This is my first time too!

391
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:36,592
But, Jin, you were in the army.

392
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:38,677
The army doesn't use boats like this.

393
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,012
I trust you, Ye-eun.

394
00:19:40,095 --> 00:19:42,097
You can count on me, Jin.

395
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:43,390
Let's go!

396
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,852
THE BANANA BOAT TAKES OFF

397
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:57,279
We're pirates!

398
00:19:57,362 --> 00:19:59,823
-Kian's B&B is the best!
-Yes!

399
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:11,835
THE PLANNER IS PROUD

400
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:14,963
Let's get it!

401
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:17,466
I can't see!

402
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:18,842
Don't turn back!

403
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:19,885
Let's go faster!

404
00:20:19,968 --> 00:20:21,887
Just trust us!

405
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:25,974
Full speed ahead!

406
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:27,684
They're crazy.

407
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:29,561
They're all crazy.

408
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:30,854
This is awesome.

409
00:20:31,355 --> 00:20:32,439
Don't turn back!

410
00:20:32,522 --> 00:20:34,358
Keep moving forward!

411
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:36,068
-Don't stop. Just go!
-Just go!

412
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:37,819
-Don't stop. Just go!
-Just go!

413
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:39,571
What does that mean?

414
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:42,574
-It means we never back down.
-Grit and determination?

415
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:43,575
Say it with us, Jin.

416
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:44,660
Keep moving…

417
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:45,953
Forward!

418
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:47,746
Don't stop.

419
00:20:47,829 --> 00:20:48,789
Just go!

420
00:20:49,998 --> 00:20:52,084
Look to our right. The scenery is insane.

421
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:53,794
-Gosh, it's pretty.
-It's insane.

422
00:20:53,877 --> 00:20:55,003
It's so pretty!

423
00:20:56,004 --> 00:20:58,173
-I love this.
-It's crazy.

424
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:01,260
-I'm riding this on the way back!
-I'm on cloud nine!

425
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:07,349
We sped through the emerald-green waters
fast and safely, which we really enjoyed.

426
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:09,643
Damn.

427
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:14,898
Let's hurry.

428
00:21:15,857 --> 00:21:17,025
Let's get to shore.

429
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:19,569
This is the best!

430
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:21,697
Help me.

431
00:21:22,864 --> 00:21:24,324
I need help.

432
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:30,247
IN A DIFFERENT WORLD FROM THE OTHERS

433
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:36,837
ARRIVED AT HYEONPO PORT

434
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:41,550
-That was fun, right?
-It was the best!

435
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:43,343
CAPTAIN JI IS THE BEST

436
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:44,845
That was excellent driving.

437
00:21:44,928 --> 00:21:47,347
-It was fun, right?
-It was super fun.

438
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:51,268
Where's our boss?

439
00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:53,770
THE BOSS HAS DISAPPEARED

440
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:55,981
-Oh dear.
-Where's Kian?

441
00:21:56,898 --> 00:21:58,442
The boss is still seasick.

442
00:21:58,525 --> 00:22:00,485
HE'S RIGHT HERE

443
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:02,904
-He's really nauseated.
-Is he lying over there?

444
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:07,951
-Boss!
-I'm still seasick.

445
00:22:08,035 --> 00:22:12,956
-Boss!
-I'm sorry you have to see me like this.

446
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,625
You're the one
who built the B&B on a barge.

447
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:26,303
-Where are the guests?
-Over there.

448
00:22:26,386 --> 00:22:27,763
Should we get going?

449
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:28,847
THEY ARRIVED SAFELY

450
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:30,891
THEIR SAFETY IS ALL THAT MATTERS

451
00:22:30,974 --> 00:22:32,809
-I'm dizzy now that we're on land.
-Me too.

452
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:34,269
Just a little bit.

453
00:22:34,352 --> 00:22:38,023
-Now that I'm on land, I feel dizzy again.
-The ground feels uneven.

454
00:22:38,106 --> 00:22:41,109
-Let's go get some squid.
-Squid soup or squid mulhoe?

455
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:42,569
-I want mulhoe.
-Let's get that.

456
00:22:42,652 --> 00:22:43,737
I want mulhoe too.

457
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:46,323
-I want something cold.
-Let's go. I want mulhoe.

458
00:22:46,406 --> 00:22:48,700
Boss, what if you get carsick too?

459
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:50,368
You stay here, and we'll go.

460
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:52,913
-No, I have to eat mulhoe.
-No, you don't.

461
00:22:52,996 --> 00:22:54,498
You don't need mulhoe, Boss.

462
00:22:54,581 --> 00:22:57,501
No, I think I'll feel better
if I eat something.

463
00:22:57,584 --> 00:22:59,795
-You'll feel better if you eat.
-Let's go then.

464
00:23:00,962 --> 00:23:02,547
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

465
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:04,341
I'll help you walk.

466
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:11,181
I don't know what I would've done
without you.

467
00:23:11,264 --> 00:23:13,350
Jin, you're so good at everything.

468
00:23:13,433 --> 00:23:16,645
You're such a responsible
and hardworking person.

469
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:18,814
Thank you so much, Jin.

470
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:22,526
-Oh my.
-Hello, Kian.

471
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:23,819
-Kian.
-I'll see you later.

472
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:25,237
-Oh my.
-Hello, Kian.

473
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,697
-Kian.
-I'll see you all later.

474
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:29,741
-Take care.
-I hope you feel better.

475
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:33,245
-Should we get you something?
-No, thanks.

476
00:23:33,328 --> 00:23:36,665
Don't worry about me. I'm fine.

477
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:37,833
-Got it!
-Got it!

478
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:39,292
Take care.

479
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:41,461
-Tell me if you need anything.
-Okay!

480
00:23:42,045 --> 00:23:43,046
Let's go.

481
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:44,798
THE JOB-SEEKER TEAM HITS THE ROAD

482
00:23:44,881 --> 00:23:47,717
I can push through anything
except for motion sickness.

483
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:49,427
You'll end up throwing up.

484
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:50,762
-No, he needs to eat.
-I'm okay.

485
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:52,389
I'm starting to feel better.

486
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:54,224
Let's go for now.

487
00:23:54,307 --> 00:23:58,186
THE STAFF HEADS TOWARD THE RESTAURANT

488
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:00,230
Can you sing for us while you drive?

489
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:04,067
Let's sing a song we all know.

490
00:24:04,151 --> 00:24:07,237
Let's look for running water in a valley

491
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:10,949
-Where we can hear echoes
-Where we can hear echoes

492
00:24:11,032 --> 00:24:14,911
-Let's take a trip there
-Let's take a trip there

493
00:24:15,495 --> 00:24:18,623
-Why aren't you singing, Ye-eun?
-Can I sing alto?

494
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:19,624
-Alto?
-Yes.

495
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:22,377
-Then you have to sing soprano.
-Okay, I'll do that.

496
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:24,129
Five, six, seven, eight.

497
00:24:24,212 --> 00:24:27,382
Let's look for running water in a valley

498
00:24:27,465 --> 00:24:30,844
Where we can hear echoes

499
00:24:30,927 --> 00:24:34,848
Let's take a trip there

500
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:39,227
NO MORE MOTION SICKNESS

501
00:24:40,687 --> 00:24:41,688
Are you a banshee?

502
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:43,648
It's the best I can do.

503
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:45,275
-How was singing alto?
-Good.

504
00:24:45,358 --> 00:24:48,445
To be honest,
I'm not sure if I heard your alto.

505
00:24:48,528 --> 00:24:50,447
-Let's hear it this time.
-Got it.

506
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:51,990
-I want that bass sound.
-Sure.

507
00:24:52,073 --> 00:24:53,116
-Okay.
-All right, Ye-eun.

508
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,202
-Five, six, seven, eight.
-Five, six, seven, eight.

509
00:24:55,285 --> 00:24:57,871
Let's look for running water…

510
00:25:03,585 --> 00:25:05,295
You're killing me.

511
00:25:05,962 --> 00:25:07,589
She's freaking hilarious.

512
00:25:09,132 --> 00:25:12,719
-Let's look for running water in a valley
-Let's look for running water in a valley

513
00:25:12,802 --> 00:25:14,763
That bass tone was awesome.

514
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:16,389
The alto part was great.

515
00:25:16,473 --> 00:25:19,643
You lay down the bass,
and I'll stack my vocals on top.

516
00:25:19,726 --> 00:25:21,853
-Let's try that.
-In a sequence?

517
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:23,230
Here we go.

518
00:25:23,313 --> 00:25:26,816
-Let's look for running water in a valley
-Let's look for running water in a valley

519
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:30,070
Where we can hear echoes

520
00:25:30,153 --> 00:25:34,491
Let's take a trip there

521
00:25:34,574 --> 00:25:36,743
THE BIZARRE CHOIR

522
00:25:45,835 --> 00:25:48,171
-It's pretty catchy.
-You're hilarious, Ye-eun.

523
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:49,798
It's the mulhoe place!

524
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:51,508
-We're here.
-We're finally here.

525
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:53,301
Hello, ma'am.

526
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:54,886
-Hello.
-Hello, ma'am.

527
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:57,264
-Yes!
-Here's the mulhoe.

528
00:25:57,347 --> 00:25:58,598
I got saury.

529
00:25:58,682 --> 00:26:00,100
SAURY MULHOE

530
00:26:00,183 --> 00:26:01,851
Oh, I'm so happy.

531
00:26:01,935 --> 00:26:03,228
This is so great.

532
00:26:03,311 --> 00:26:07,691
I just got a whiff of sesame oil,
and it's making my nausea go away.

533
00:26:09,776 --> 00:26:10,902
Does it hit the spot?

534
00:26:16,491 --> 00:26:18,868
This is so delicious.

535
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:21,413
I'm so happy.

536
00:26:21,496 --> 00:26:22,872
This is heavenly.

537
00:26:22,956 --> 00:26:25,041
-Aren't you glad we're eating out?
-Yes.

538
00:26:28,128 --> 00:26:29,337
I think we were all hungry.

539
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:32,549
It feels less like running a B&B
and more like working on a boat.

540
00:26:32,632 --> 00:26:36,052
-If you work on a boat, you get exhausted.
-Right.

541
00:26:36,136 --> 00:26:37,429
So you have to eat a lot.

542
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:43,268
THE BOAT OWNER IN QUESTION
DUNKS ALL OF HIS RICE

543
00:26:51,192 --> 00:26:54,029
-Are you done with your rice?
-Yes.

544
00:26:55,739 --> 00:26:57,657
-Isn't that a bit unhygienic?
-No.

545
00:26:58,283 --> 00:27:00,201
It can't go to waste. That?

546
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,375
What's rockfish? I've never heard of it.

547
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:08,293
ROCKFISH MULHOE

548
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:14,341
ROCK AND ROLL?

549
00:27:14,424 --> 00:27:16,468
PLAYING DUMB

550
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:20,180
BITING HER LIP

551
00:27:23,016 --> 00:27:24,559
-What?
-Rock mulhoe.

552
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:26,269
And roll mulhoe.

553
00:27:30,398 --> 00:27:33,193
Why won't you laugh? You're so harsh.

554
00:27:33,276 --> 00:27:34,402
Do BTS members laugh?

555
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:36,112
No, they totally ignore me.

556
00:27:36,196 --> 00:27:37,947
At least they're honest with you.

557
00:27:38,698 --> 00:27:40,075
Everyone is so mean.

558
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:42,369
If your own team members ignore you…

559
00:27:42,452 --> 00:27:45,288
-At least we pretend to listen.
-Why complain to us?

560
00:27:45,372 --> 00:27:47,123
We react to it in some way.

561
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:50,502
I'm actually being polite here.
I whisper jokes into their ears.

562
00:27:50,585 --> 00:27:52,462
I don't get his sense of humor.

563
00:27:52,545 --> 00:27:54,964
But I don't want to disappoint Jin,

564
00:27:55,048 --> 00:27:57,884
so I laugh and say, "You're so funny!"

565
00:27:57,967 --> 00:28:00,762
In any case,
thanks for trying to make us laugh.

566
00:28:02,138 --> 00:28:03,181
That's embarrassing.

567
00:28:03,264 --> 00:28:05,016
What should we get for dinner?

568
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,267
ALREADY THINKING ABOUT DINNER

569
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:09,270
-Flounder is a safe bet.
-Let's go to a fish place and ask.

570
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:10,814
TONIGHT'S DINNER IS RAW FLOUNDER

571
00:28:11,439 --> 00:28:12,690
-Come on over.
-Hello.

572
00:28:12,774 --> 00:28:14,651
What kind of fish do you have?

573
00:28:14,734 --> 00:28:18,488
Flounder, rockfish, filefish,
squid, and sea snails make a good combo.

574
00:28:18,571 --> 00:28:20,240
-An assorted platter?
-Can we do that?

575
00:28:20,323 --> 00:28:21,366
That sounds good.

576
00:28:21,449 --> 00:28:23,868
-Go inside and wait a bit.
-Okay.

577
00:28:26,287 --> 00:28:28,331
AS SHE PREPARES THE ASSORTED PLATTER

578
00:28:29,249 --> 00:28:30,917
I'm in a food coma right now.

579
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:31,960
FOOD COMA

580
00:28:32,585 --> 00:28:33,670
I'm so sleepy.

581
00:28:34,212 --> 00:28:36,423
-Ma'am?
-Yes?

582
00:28:36,506 --> 00:28:38,800
We're a little tired right now.

583
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:41,261
Would it be okay
to lie down here for a bit?

584
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:43,763
-We'll get up if customers come.
-Lie down over there.

585
00:28:43,847 --> 00:28:44,889
Thank you.

586
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:50,979
Jeez.

587
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:56,067
I'm so sleepy.

588
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:14,461
10 MINUTES LATER

589
00:29:15,295 --> 00:29:16,755
TWITCHES

590
00:29:18,631 --> 00:29:19,549
What's going on?

591
00:29:21,342 --> 00:29:22,927
I had two dreams just now.

592
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:29,184
I had two dreams.

593
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:31,603
Really? I only had one dream.

594
00:29:33,813 --> 00:29:37,734
LOOKS READY TO DREAM ANOTHER ONE

595
00:29:38,693 --> 00:29:42,030
This is so embarrassing.
A superstar shouldn't act this way.

596
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,328
What am I doing?

597
00:29:48,411 --> 00:29:49,412
You look like a ghost.

598
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:55,084
I hate to tell you this,
but this isn't your house.

599
00:29:55,168 --> 00:29:56,503
What?

600
00:29:56,586 --> 00:29:57,587
Wake up.

601
00:29:57,670 --> 00:30:00,465
-Did you dream too?
-Yes.

602
00:30:00,548 --> 00:30:02,008
I had two dreams.

603
00:30:02,091 --> 00:30:03,426
Oh, my hand…

604
00:30:07,263 --> 00:30:10,016
-The platter is ready.
-Here we go.

605
00:30:10,099 --> 00:30:11,434
Thank you, ma'am.

606
00:30:11,518 --> 00:30:13,770
-Thank you.
-Thank you for coming.

607
00:30:15,271 --> 00:30:17,732
THE OWNER WILL RETURN
AFTER A VISIT TO THE HOSPITAL

608
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:19,901
-Sorry about this.
-No, you need to get treated.

609
00:30:23,613 --> 00:30:25,740
WHILE THE OWNER IS GETTING TREATED

610
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:29,369
They said it'll take ten minutes
to redress the wound, so let's rest a bit.

611
00:30:29,452 --> 00:30:31,830
I've put up a strong front,
but it's been tough.

612
00:30:31,913 --> 00:30:34,833
With the climbing wall,
I just sigh and say,

613
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:37,001
"I have to go up there again?"

614
00:30:37,085 --> 00:30:39,045
But with the pole in the kitchen,

615
00:30:39,128 --> 00:30:41,756
it's more like,
"How am I going to get up there?"

616
00:30:42,465 --> 00:30:44,259
Let's do something about the pole then.

617
00:30:44,342 --> 00:30:47,303
No, not a chance.
That's not fair to our previous guests.

618
00:30:47,887 --> 00:30:52,058
Let's stop by a popular photo spot
and take pictures of ourselves.

619
00:30:52,141 --> 00:30:53,893
My photos are all feed-worthy.

620
00:30:53,977 --> 00:30:55,937
Take one that I can use as my profile pic.

621
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,522
You can trust me on that.

622
00:30:57,605 --> 00:30:59,440
Look, it's Samseonam Rock.

623
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:01,901
SAMSEONAM ROCK

624
00:31:01,985 --> 00:31:03,194
Tell me what you want.

625
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:05,613
-I want to be in between the rocks.
-In between?

626
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:07,073
-That's right.
-Okay.

627
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:10,201
Hold on.

628
00:31:11,995 --> 00:31:14,038
This looks really good.

629
00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:15,832
It looks great.

630
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:18,209
One, two, three.

631
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:24,757
-Hey, I said…
-Listen, Jin.

632
00:31:24,841 --> 00:31:29,178
You wanted the rocks to be visible,
and you're right in the middle of them.

633
00:31:29,262 --> 00:31:30,930
Can't you make it look nicer?

634
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:33,349
Make the rocks look bigger
and make me look…

635
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:35,268
-Taller?
-Exactly.

636
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:36,686
This is the one.

637
00:31:37,353 --> 00:31:38,521
Seriously.

638
00:31:39,606 --> 00:31:41,357
This one's amazing. You'll love it.

639
00:31:41,441 --> 00:31:43,359
There's no way you won't like it.

640
00:31:43,443 --> 00:31:45,486
Hey, Ye-eun.

641
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:48,865
-This is your next profile pic.
-How can I use this as my profile pic?

642
00:31:48,948 --> 00:31:50,450
Why not? It came out nice.

643
00:31:50,533 --> 00:31:52,035
THE OWNER JOINS THEM AT HYEONPO PORT

644
00:31:52,118 --> 00:31:54,162
-Let's go. Hurry.
-Let's go.

645
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:56,039
I hope I don't get sick again.

646
00:31:56,122 --> 00:31:57,749
That was blissful.

647
00:31:57,832 --> 00:31:59,042
Was it a blissful break?

648
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:00,919
My time on land was blissful.

649
00:32:02,003 --> 00:32:05,173
WHAT ARE THE GUESTS UP TO?

650
00:32:08,676 --> 00:32:10,511
An island that can't easily be seen.

651
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:11,804
CHUNG-IL ARRIVES IN DOKDO

652
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:14,390
Gosh, look at this view.

653
00:32:15,308 --> 00:32:16,935
It's absolutely beautiful.

654
00:32:20,355 --> 00:32:24,067
Kian said you can only see Dokdo
if your family has gained enough virtue.

655
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:26,611
I guess my family has.

656
00:32:27,487 --> 00:32:28,863
I can't believe I'm in Dokdo.

657
00:32:29,822 --> 00:32:31,324
And on such a clear day.

658
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:34,160
It's so beautiful.

659
00:32:34,243 --> 00:32:36,245
It's the most beautiful place I've seen.

660
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:38,539
The water here is very calm.

661
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:42,460
It's such a clear and pretty day.

662
00:32:42,543 --> 00:32:44,587
It's fascinating here. I love it.

663
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:51,344
JOINS THE JOB-SEEKER TEAM
AFTER HIS DOKDO TRIP

664
00:32:51,427 --> 00:32:53,638
-All right, let's go.
-Okay.

665
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:56,391
ELECTRIC MOTORBIKE

666
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:59,268
AND ELECTRIC BICYCLES

667
00:33:03,731 --> 00:33:05,441
The weather is incredible.

668
00:33:05,525 --> 00:33:07,193
This is nuts. It's so refreshing.

669
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:09,570
This is what I'm talking about.

670
00:33:11,197 --> 00:33:12,657
This feels amazing.

671
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:13,992
It's the best.

672
00:33:16,619 --> 00:33:17,537
Look at that.

673
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:20,707
This is so nice.

674
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:23,167
When else would we ride
around Ulleungdo Island?

675
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:25,586
This is a dream come true.

676
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:28,339
Our youth starts right now.

677
00:33:28,423 --> 00:33:29,757
Youth.

678
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:31,175
OUR YOUTH STARTS RIGHT NOW

679
00:33:32,927 --> 00:33:34,220
It's good to be back.

680
00:33:34,303 --> 00:33:35,513
MEANWHILE, BACK AT KIAN'S B&B

681
00:33:35,596 --> 00:33:37,724
-Let's tidy up.
-I'll clean the floor.

682
00:33:37,807 --> 00:33:41,519
Ye-eun, if you clean upstairs,
I'll clean downstairs.

683
00:33:41,602 --> 00:33:43,104
YE-EUN IS IN CHARGE OF THE 2ND FLOOR

684
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:47,108
AND JIN IS IN CHARGE OF THE 1ST FLOOR

685
00:34:01,789 --> 00:34:03,207
Bathroom cleaning time.

686
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:05,668
THE OWNER IS IN CHARGE OF THE BATHROOM

687
00:34:36,991 --> 00:34:38,826
How did this splash up there?

688
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:53,216
BATHROOM CLEANING DONE

689
00:34:54,383 --> 00:34:57,428
IMMEDIATELY WASHES UP

690
00:35:04,977 --> 00:35:07,814
I'm almost germophobic.

691
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:14,070
Can you paint the three of us on the wall?

692
00:35:14,153 --> 00:35:15,738
Please paint our faces on the wall.

693
00:35:16,322 --> 00:35:17,657
Make me look handsome.

694
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:20,701
I'll have to paint it here.

695
00:35:26,582 --> 00:35:27,917
I'll make it quick.

696
00:35:41,681 --> 00:35:43,141
She turned out too big.

697
00:36:06,706 --> 00:36:07,707
Gosh, I'm tired.

698
00:36:09,292 --> 00:36:11,544
YE-EUN, JIN

699
00:36:11,627 --> 00:36:14,130
I'm exhausted.
I need a quick ten-minute break.

700
00:36:16,966 --> 00:36:18,092
It's a new guest.

701
00:36:19,135 --> 00:36:20,887
-It's a new guest.
-I can't believe it.

702
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:22,430
Hello?

703
00:36:23,472 --> 00:36:24,849
-Hello?
-Hello.

704
00:36:24,932 --> 00:36:26,767
-Yes, hello there.
-Hello.

705
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:28,853
-We'll be staying at the B&B.
-Okay.

706
00:36:28,936 --> 00:36:30,396
Can we check in?

707
00:36:30,479 --> 00:36:32,815
-How many people are in your group?
-It's two people.

708
00:36:32,899 --> 00:36:34,317
-Two people?
-Yes.

709
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:38,696
-Please come to Hyeonpo Port by 5 p.m.
-Hyeonpo Port?

710
00:36:38,779 --> 00:36:39,697
See you soon.

711
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:41,657
-See you then.
-Thank you.

712
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:44,452
They sound the most cheerful
out of everyone so far.

713
00:36:45,953 --> 00:36:48,247
30 MINUTES UNTIL GUEST PICK-UP

714
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:51,709
Hey, this is cool.
I didn't know we could kayak here.

715
00:36:51,792 --> 00:36:53,628
KAYAK?

716
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:58,090
Can you paddle alone?

717
00:36:58,674 --> 00:37:00,009
I don't know, but I'll try.

718
00:37:11,854 --> 00:37:15,066
At this speed,
I can transport a guest on this.

719
00:37:16,943 --> 00:37:20,279
YE-EUN'S BOAT ALSO SETS OUT

720
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:22,073
Ye-eun, leave one guest for me.

721
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:24,033
The one who came alone.

722
00:37:24,116 --> 00:37:25,201
CHUNG-IL, MY FRIEND

723
00:37:25,785 --> 00:37:27,662
OKAY

724
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:33,334
Hey, I made it pretty far.

725
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:38,422
10 MINUTES SINCE LEAVING KIAN'S B&B

726
00:37:40,174 --> 00:37:41,259
Damn, I'm tired.

727
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:47,390
DESTINATION
CURRENT LOCATION

728
00:37:47,473 --> 00:37:48,349
Damn it.

729
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:52,770
MEANWHILE, A TAXI ARRIVES AT THE PORT

730
00:37:52,853 --> 00:37:54,272
We're here.

731
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:56,274
NEW GUESTS

732
00:37:56,357 --> 00:37:57,525
It's so nice here!

733
00:37:57,608 --> 00:37:58,901
I'm looking forward to the B&B.

734
00:37:58,985 --> 00:38:00,695
-I've never been to one.
-Me neither.

735
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:03,072
DANCES

736
00:38:03,155 --> 00:38:04,073
SHAKES

737
00:38:04,156 --> 00:38:06,909
-I can't wait to get to the B&B.
-I'm curious too.

738
00:38:09,662 --> 00:38:12,832
YE-EUN'S BOAT APPROACHES

739
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:14,875
When are they coming?

740
00:38:16,085 --> 00:38:18,337
DOESN'T NOTICE THE BOAT

741
00:38:19,588 --> 00:38:20,631
Hey, it's a boat.

742
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:23,634
-Are we taking a boat?
-That's a banana boat.

743
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:25,261
That can't be our ride.

744
00:38:25,761 --> 00:38:26,929
That'd be hilarious.

745
00:38:27,013 --> 00:38:29,390
THERE'S NO WAY

746
00:38:29,473 --> 00:38:31,017
It looks like it, but it can't be.

747
00:38:31,517 --> 00:38:32,768
-It's getting closer.
-Is it?

748
00:38:32,852 --> 00:38:34,020
She's coming here.

749
00:38:34,103 --> 00:38:35,021
Seriously?

750
00:38:36,188 --> 00:38:37,773
-Are you serious?
-Five o'clock.

751
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:40,568
Guests checking into Kian's B&B at 5 p.m.?

752
00:38:40,651 --> 00:38:41,610
-Yes!
-Hello.

753
00:38:41,694 --> 00:38:43,195
-Hello.
-Nice to meet you.

754
00:38:43,279 --> 00:38:45,364
Put on a life jacket and hop in.

755
00:38:45,906 --> 00:38:48,409
-Hop in there?
-Aren't we going to the B&B?

756
00:38:48,492 --> 00:38:49,702
Want to ride the banana boat?

757
00:38:49,785 --> 00:38:51,078
-Yes.
-No.

758
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:52,413
-Do you want to?
-Yes!

759
00:38:52,496 --> 00:38:54,040
-This is your chance.
-Right!

760
00:38:54,123 --> 00:38:57,460
So leave your bags here,
and get on the boat.

761
00:38:57,543 --> 00:38:59,295
This is going to be fun.

762
00:38:59,378 --> 00:39:00,838
-Really?
-Are you serious?

763
00:39:00,921 --> 00:39:03,007
This will be so much fun. I can't wait.

764
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:03,966
-It's fun.
-Right.

765
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:04,884
EXCITED

766
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:07,845
NERVOUS

767
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,139
Give me your hand.

768
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:12,266
Thank you.

769
00:39:12,892 --> 00:39:14,268
Keep your phones safe.

770
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:17,438
I'm actually really scared.

771
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:24,904
THE JOB-SEEKER TEAM RETURNS

772
00:39:24,987 --> 00:39:28,616
Say hi to our new guests.
They're checking in today.

773
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:30,451
-Hello.
-Hello.

774
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:31,744
It's sinking a bit.

775
00:39:32,661 --> 00:39:33,788
It's slowly sinking.

776
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:37,583
NOISY AND CROWDED

777
00:39:37,666 --> 00:39:39,043
You're all so young.

778
00:39:40,086 --> 00:39:42,171
We have so many young guests.

779
00:39:43,422 --> 00:39:44,924
CHUNG-IL ARRIVES

780
00:39:45,007 --> 00:39:45,925
Chung-il.

781
00:39:46,008 --> 00:39:48,094
Jin wants to ride in the kayak with you.

782
00:39:48,177 --> 00:39:49,595
That sounds great.

783
00:39:49,678 --> 00:39:51,764
-That will be your ride.
-Got it.

784
00:39:51,847 --> 00:39:53,808
Wait up. I'm on my way.

785
00:39:59,188 --> 00:40:00,189
This is exhausting.

786
00:40:01,273 --> 00:40:04,151
I can already see it,
but why am I not getting any closer?

787
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:05,403
ENTERS THE SEAWALL AREA

788
00:40:05,486 --> 00:40:07,405
You must be tired, Jin!

789
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,824
That's amazing though.

790
00:40:09,907 --> 00:40:12,284
20 MINUTES SINCE LEAVING KIAN'S B&B

791
00:40:12,368 --> 00:40:13,702
Hello, dear guest!

792
00:40:14,954 --> 00:40:16,956
I'm here to pick you up, sir!

793
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:18,457
Thank you.

794
00:40:18,999 --> 00:40:22,044
My friend, I came to pick you up.

795
00:40:22,128 --> 00:40:23,129
Thanks.

796
00:40:24,171 --> 00:40:25,089
Oh gosh.

797
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:28,259
This is great.

798
00:40:28,342 --> 00:40:29,718
-Are those new guests?
-Yes!

799
00:40:29,802 --> 00:40:31,011
Hello.

800
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:32,012
-Hello.
-Hello.

801
00:40:33,347 --> 00:40:34,348
I'm really scared.

802
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:36,559
-It'll be fun.
-Keep moving forward!

803
00:40:36,642 --> 00:40:37,560
Don't stop.

804
00:40:37,643 --> 00:40:38,602
-Just go!
-Go!

805
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:40,521
ALREADY SYNCHRONIZED

806
00:40:42,648 --> 00:40:43,858
Oh, my gosh!

807
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:48,112
-This isn't scary at all, Yeo-jin.
-I'm scared!

808
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:51,490
Step on it!

809
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:56,287
This is great.

810
00:40:57,496 --> 00:41:00,124
-Go faster!
-Speed up!

811
00:41:00,207 --> 00:41:01,292
Step on it!

812
00:41:02,793 --> 00:41:03,711
They're hilarious.

813
00:41:07,214 --> 00:41:08,215
This is awesome.

814
00:41:08,883 --> 00:41:10,342
Isn't this great?

815
00:41:10,426 --> 00:41:12,261
So great!

816
00:41:16,515 --> 00:41:19,602
I DON'T LOVE THIS

817
00:41:21,061 --> 00:41:23,105
I'm so mad at you.

818
00:41:29,278 --> 00:41:30,738
This is so much fun!

819
00:41:30,821 --> 00:41:31,822
ARRIVES AT KIAN'S B&B

820
00:41:31,906 --> 00:41:33,365
-What is it?
-Is this the B&B?

821
00:41:34,033 --> 00:41:35,868
-Is this real?
-It really is bizarre.

822
00:41:35,951 --> 00:41:37,828
How did they get it here?

823
00:41:37,912 --> 00:41:41,207
It looked like a floating dock
at a water sports park.

824
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:44,543
I thought, "Is this really the B&B?"

825
00:41:45,669 --> 00:41:47,838
-Good afternoon.
-Good afternoon!

826
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:48,756
Where's Jin?

827
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:51,926
-He's with Chung-il.
-Those two are friends.

828
00:41:52,676 --> 00:41:53,886
Hey, go right.

829
00:41:53,969 --> 00:41:57,014
THE TWO FRIENDS ARE STRUGGLING

830
00:41:57,097 --> 00:41:58,599
We need to go right.

831
00:41:59,099 --> 00:42:00,726
Why are you going the other way?

832
00:42:00,809 --> 00:42:03,896
-One more circle before we head in.
-Hey, buddy.

833
00:42:06,815 --> 00:42:10,694
If you paddle hard on one side,
you'll go in the opposite direction.

834
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:13,155
You have to paddle more gently.

835
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:16,784
ONE MORE CIRCLE

836
00:42:17,493 --> 00:42:21,247
It looks easy enough to do,
but it's actually pretty hard.

837
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:23,958
-The waves make it harder.
-Exactly.

838
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:26,001
-I'm so tired.
-Hey, I see it!

839
00:42:26,085 --> 00:42:28,462
-There it is.
-We're halfway there.

840
00:42:29,421 --> 00:42:31,173
I'm glad I have a friend here.

841
00:42:31,257 --> 00:42:34,260
That's really nice of you to say.

842
00:42:34,343 --> 00:42:36,720
I almost died when I came across alone.

843
00:42:39,765 --> 00:42:40,849
Are you tired, buddy?

844
00:42:42,476 --> 00:42:43,727
-One.
-One.

845
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:45,187
-Two.
-Two.

846
00:42:45,271 --> 00:42:46,689
One.

847
00:42:46,772 --> 00:42:48,023
-Two.
-We're going faster.

848
00:42:48,107 --> 00:42:49,316
-Great.
-Here we go.

849
00:42:49,858 --> 00:42:51,569
We have good teamwork.

850
00:42:51,652 --> 00:42:53,195
-Because we're the same age?
-Exactly.

851
00:42:53,279 --> 00:42:55,322
We're a bit off-balance, but still…

852
00:42:55,906 --> 00:42:57,449
Boss!

853
00:42:57,533 --> 00:42:58,534
Welcome back.

854
00:43:00,828 --> 00:43:02,246
We finally made it back.

855
00:43:03,914 --> 00:43:05,082
Be careful.

856
00:43:08,127 --> 00:43:09,628
-Hey…
-You made it.

857
00:43:09,712 --> 00:43:11,672
HE MADE IT

858
00:43:11,755 --> 00:43:13,966
-He made it back on kayak.
-He made it.

859
00:43:14,049 --> 00:43:15,551
-He did it.
-He actually did it.

860
00:43:15,634 --> 00:43:18,262
ZERO ENERGY

861
00:43:18,345 --> 00:43:20,222
Hi, my name is Hong Yeo-jin.

862
00:43:20,306 --> 00:43:21,932
My name is Lee Yoo-jin.

863
00:43:22,016 --> 00:43:24,143
LEE YOO-JIN, 24 YEARS OLD

864
00:43:24,226 --> 00:43:26,312
HONG YEO-JIN, 24 YEARS OLD

865
00:43:26,395 --> 00:43:28,731
-So, there's no entrance here.
-Sorry?

866
00:43:28,814 --> 00:43:30,858
You go up this way…

867
00:43:30,941 --> 00:43:32,693
SHOCKED

868
00:43:32,776 --> 00:43:34,528
-How about we talk upstairs?
-Okay.

869
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:36,030
-Let's go up.
-Bag, please.

870
00:43:36,905 --> 00:43:38,365
Maybe I can carry it.

871
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:40,993
If you can do it…

872
00:43:41,076 --> 00:43:43,078
-Yeo-jin.
-Wait a minute, Yoo-jin.

873
00:43:43,162 --> 00:43:44,371
I think I can do it.

874
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:46,999
Hey, she's good.

875
00:43:52,171 --> 00:43:53,088
She's really good.

876
00:43:53,172 --> 00:43:55,174
-Is there something to step on?
-Yes.

877
00:43:56,383 --> 00:43:57,217
What the heck?

878
00:43:57,301 --> 00:43:58,636
Now I have to do it too.

879
00:43:58,719 --> 00:44:01,972
-Is your friend an athlete?
-We're both dancers.

880
00:44:02,514 --> 00:44:03,515
DANCE MAJORS

881
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:05,100
That's why you're flexible.

882
00:44:07,186 --> 00:44:08,187
This is fun.

883
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:11,357
-It's easy, right?
-This is my first time.

884
00:44:11,982 --> 00:44:14,151
-You're right.
-Everything's slip-resistant.

885
00:44:14,234 --> 00:44:15,402
Step on that.

886
00:44:17,071 --> 00:44:20,991
It felt like an initiation rite
for new guests.

887
00:44:25,621 --> 00:44:28,957
ONE BY ONE, EVERYONE CLIMBS UP

888
00:44:31,251 --> 00:44:33,837
ONCE ALL THE GUESTS ARE CHECKED IN

889
00:44:33,921 --> 00:44:35,839
THE POOL WILL BE OPENED AS PLANNED

890
00:44:35,923 --> 00:44:38,467
-Can we swim?
-Yes, it's open until 7 p.m.

891
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:39,385
Gather around!

892
00:44:39,468 --> 00:44:41,970
John, our expert, will come to the front.

893
00:44:42,054 --> 00:44:44,848
Loosen your wrists and ankles.
One, two, three, four.

894
00:44:44,932 --> 00:44:46,975
-All at once?
-Five, six, seven, eight.

895
00:44:47,059 --> 00:44:49,395
Two, two, three, four.

896
00:44:49,478 --> 00:44:51,480
Five, six, seven, eight.

897
00:44:51,563 --> 00:44:52,690
-Attention!
-Yes, sir.

898
00:44:53,565 --> 00:44:55,234
What is your name?

899
00:44:55,317 --> 00:44:57,319
-Hong Yeo-jin, sir.
-Yeo-jin.

900
00:44:57,403 --> 00:44:58,695
Do you have anything to say?

901
00:44:58,779 --> 00:44:59,947
I'm scared.

902
00:45:00,572 --> 00:45:03,117
-Tell your mom that you love her.
-I love you, Mom!

903
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:04,201
Oh gosh.

904
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:07,287
There she goes!

905
00:45:08,956 --> 00:45:10,541
-Who's next?
-I'm scared.

906
00:45:10,624 --> 00:45:11,959
I didn't get water up my nose.

907
00:45:12,042 --> 00:45:13,293
-You didn't?
-No.

908
00:45:13,794 --> 00:45:16,338
I love you, Mom!

909
00:45:20,426 --> 00:45:21,844
I got some up my nose.

910
00:45:22,344 --> 00:45:24,721
-So much water up my nose.
-This is so fun.

911
00:45:24,805 --> 00:45:26,265
PROUD

912
00:45:26,348 --> 00:45:29,893
IT'S SHOWTIME

913
00:45:41,697 --> 00:45:42,698
It's so cold!

914
00:45:46,452 --> 00:45:49,288
WHILE EVERYONE IS HAVING FUN

915
00:45:52,499 --> 00:45:55,419
PUTTING THE FINISHING TOUCHES
ON THE STAFF MURAL

916
00:45:56,879 --> 00:45:58,505
-What are you painting?
-What?

917
00:45:58,589 --> 00:46:00,591
I'm painting the staff here.

918
00:46:02,134 --> 00:46:03,677
We're glad to have you here.

919
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:04,928
-Really?
-Yes.

920
00:46:05,012 --> 00:46:07,181
There was a military vibe yesterday.

921
00:46:07,264 --> 00:46:09,975
But today, it feels more like I Am Solo.

922
00:46:10,058 --> 00:46:11,435
-I Am Solo?
-Really?

923
00:46:12,769 --> 00:46:14,771
-Ye-eun.
-It's glaring at you.

924
00:46:18,650 --> 00:46:20,068
The spelling for ARMY is…

925
00:46:20,736 --> 00:46:22,571
It should be A-R-M-Y.

926
00:46:26,283 --> 00:46:27,618
It should be A-R-M-Y.

927
00:46:27,701 --> 00:46:28,619
Is that right?

928
00:46:28,702 --> 00:46:32,164
I almost got myself killed.
Thanks for saving me.

929
00:46:32,915 --> 00:46:33,749
A-R-M-Y?

930
00:46:33,832 --> 00:46:35,125
Hey, that looks amazing.

931
00:46:35,209 --> 00:46:36,668
-Hey.
-What is it?

932
00:46:36,752 --> 00:46:38,670
It's not done yet, so…

933
00:46:39,338 --> 00:46:40,881
-He doesn't want me to see it yet?
-No.

934
00:46:41,507 --> 00:46:42,549
DODGED A BULLET

935
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:45,677
So it's A-R-M-Y. Thanks so much.

936
00:46:48,514 --> 00:46:49,973
That was a close call.

937
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:52,851
I'm glad the weather's nice.

938
00:46:52,935 --> 00:46:54,811
YEO-JIN AND YOO-JIN
FINISH PLAYING IN THE POOL

939
00:46:54,895 --> 00:46:56,772
It's my first time seeing a rubber tub.

940
00:46:56,855 --> 00:46:58,357
AND HEAD TO THE OUTDOOR SHOWER AREA

941
00:46:59,441 --> 00:47:00,859
Do we just pour it?

942
00:47:05,030 --> 00:47:06,031
Is this right?

943
00:47:08,033 --> 00:47:09,785
I wouldn't experience this anywhere else.

944
00:47:09,868 --> 00:47:13,163
-I'm washing my hair right by the ocean.
-In the middle of Ulleungdo Island.

945
00:47:13,247 --> 00:47:15,415
THE STAFF AND JOB-SEEKER TEAM
COME BY TO ALSO WASH UP

946
00:47:15,499 --> 00:47:17,793
-I'll spray you down.
-Thank you.

947
00:47:18,377 --> 00:47:20,045
Spray us like you mean it.

948
00:47:20,128 --> 00:47:21,129
You want it strong?

949
00:47:37,646 --> 00:47:39,606
-How do I not frown?
-Damn it.

950
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:42,109
-I'm not doing that.
-That looks painful.

951
00:47:43,402 --> 00:47:44,403
More pressure.

952
00:47:51,702 --> 00:47:53,745
I'm sorry.

953
00:47:54,496 --> 00:47:55,497
That was too strong.

954
00:47:58,041 --> 00:47:59,042
Hang on a second.

955
00:48:04,965 --> 00:48:06,800
Who wants to take out
the fish trap with me?

956
00:48:06,883 --> 00:48:07,926
I do.

957
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:09,845
CHECKS THE FISH TRAP
WITH THE JOB-SEEKER TEAM

958
00:48:09,928 --> 00:48:11,388
The water is deep here,

959
00:48:11,471 --> 00:48:14,474
so there's a very good chance
we'll catch some fish.

960
00:48:14,558 --> 00:48:16,393
Who's the luckiest person here?

961
00:48:16,476 --> 00:48:17,978
I'm known as "Lucky Chang-jun."

962
00:48:18,061 --> 00:48:20,147
"Lucky Chang-jun"? You're up then.

963
00:48:20,772 --> 00:48:22,733
-Be careful.
-I'll hold on to you.

964
00:48:27,446 --> 00:48:28,614
TAUT

965
00:48:29,197 --> 00:48:31,366
-It feels heavy.
-What's going on?

966
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:32,784
I feel something!

967
00:48:32,868 --> 00:48:35,245
-What is it?
-It's a big one!

968
00:48:37,497 --> 00:48:39,458
-Hey, there's something in it.
-I see something.

969
00:48:39,541 --> 00:48:41,335
-What is it?
-This is huge for sure.

970
00:48:43,378 --> 00:48:45,088
-This is really…
-What is it?

971
00:48:45,172 --> 00:48:47,257
This has got to be…

972
00:48:47,341 --> 00:48:48,175
What is it?

973
00:48:48,258 --> 00:48:49,468
KIAN'S BIZARRE B&B

974
00:48:49,551 --> 00:48:51,511
What did you guys catch?

975
00:49:47,484 --> 00:49:49,486
