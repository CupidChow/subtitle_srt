1
00:00:10,927 --> 00:00:13,096
-It feels heavy.
-What's going on?

2
00:00:13,179 --> 00:00:14,514
I feel something!

3
00:00:14,597 --> 00:00:17,350
-What is it?
-It's a big one!

4
00:00:19,561 --> 00:00:21,646
-Hey, there's something in it.
-I see something.

5
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:22,856
What is it?

6
00:00:22,939 --> 00:00:25,442
-We're having a party tonight!
-Party tonight!

7
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:27,610
Get ready to eat until you burst tonight!

8
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:29,612
-This is huge for sure.
-What is it?

9
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:30,947
Hey, feel this.

10
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:32,282
-Feel the weight.
-What is it?

11
00:00:32,365 --> 00:00:33,992
I see something white.

12
00:00:35,577 --> 00:00:37,495
-This is really…
-What is it?

13
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:39,622
This has got to be…

14
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:40,540
What is it?

15
00:00:44,085 --> 00:00:45,170
What the heck?

16
00:00:45,253 --> 00:00:47,589
WHAT IS THIS?

17
00:00:47,672 --> 00:00:50,842
-It's raw squid platter!
-Is that real?

18
00:00:50,925 --> 00:00:52,260
What the heck?

19
00:00:52,343 --> 00:00:53,720
What is it?

20
00:00:53,803 --> 00:00:55,597
What did you guys catch?

21
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:58,683
IS THAT A RAW FISH PLATTER
INSIDE THE FISH TRAP?

22
00:00:59,684 --> 00:01:01,061
7 HOURS AGO

23
00:01:01,144 --> 00:01:01,978
JIN'S IDEA

24
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:04,147
Let's buy a flounder,
put it in a fish trap,

25
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:07,025
and have the Job-Seeker Team take it out.

26
00:01:07,108 --> 00:01:08,276
They'll be so surprised.

27
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:12,363
-That sounds fun.
-That's brilliant.

28
00:01:12,447 --> 00:01:13,823
Since they're looking for jobs,

29
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:16,868
catching a big fish
will make them feel lucky this year.

30
00:01:16,951 --> 00:01:17,827
JOB LUCK

31
00:01:18,536 --> 00:01:22,874
Why don't we go
with fish that's already been prepared?

32
00:01:22,957 --> 00:01:24,042
You still have to clean it.

33
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:24,959
DIZZY

34
00:01:25,043 --> 00:01:26,503
What if water gets inside?

35
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:28,379
They originally come from the ocean.

36
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:30,423
BAFFLED

37
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:33,343
Ma'am, can you make sure
water doesn't get inside

38
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:35,345
even if it's submerged in the ocean?

39
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:36,596
I can vacuum pack it.

40
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:37,806
-Really?
-Yes.

41
00:01:37,889 --> 00:01:41,017
-But why are you doing that?
-It's for a surprise.

42
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,393
IT WILL BE A SURPRISE

43
00:01:45,021 --> 00:01:46,022
10 MINUTES AGO

44
00:01:46,105 --> 00:01:49,567
It's time to put this in the ocean.

45
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:54,239
SUCCESSFULLY PUTS IT IN THE FISH TRAP

46
00:01:54,989 --> 00:01:56,449
INGREDIENTS FOR SPICY FISH STEW

47
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:05,667
Take it out.

48
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:09,712
NOT KNOWING HOW TO REACT

49
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:12,298
-You caught an assorted fish platter?
-A platter?

50
00:02:13,758 --> 00:02:15,051
Hey!

51
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,428
Hey!

52
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:20,306
HERE GOES NOTHING

53
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,475
JUST ENJOYING IT

54
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:26,938
I can't believe
you caught a raw fish platter.

55
00:02:27,021 --> 00:02:28,189
This is crazy.

56
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:31,568
-I'm so freaking lucky.
-Yeah, you really are.

57
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:33,278
THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE?

58
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:35,822
-What is this?
-Did you also catch spicy fish stew?

59
00:02:37,031 --> 00:02:38,116
Spicy fish stew!

60
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:39,617
Spicy fish stew and squid platter?

61
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:42,078
In the middle of the ocean?

62
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:45,373
And it's already been prepared!
How is this possible?

63
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:47,959
You're really lucky, my friend.

64
00:02:48,042 --> 00:02:49,043
YOU'RE REALLY LUCKY

65
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:52,088
Let's have spicy fish stew and raw fish
for dinner tonight.

66
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:55,842
I'm dizzy all of a sudden.
You are all too energetic.

67
00:02:57,886 --> 00:03:00,388
Let's go help them cook now.

68
00:03:00,471 --> 00:03:01,931
JIN HEADS TO THE KITCHEN TO COOK

69
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:03,349
Are you going to work out?

70
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:05,602
THE JOB-SEEKER TEAM HEADS TO THE GYM

71
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:06,603
Slip and counter.

72
00:03:07,228 --> 00:03:08,187
Slip and counter.

73
00:03:09,772 --> 00:03:11,900
KIAN AND CHUNG-IL ARE WORKING OUT

74
00:03:11,983 --> 00:03:12,984
One more.

75
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:15,528
Two more.

76
00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:17,780
One more.

77
00:03:22,118 --> 00:03:22,994
That's right.

78
00:03:24,078 --> 00:03:25,163
Just like that.

79
00:03:31,252 --> 00:03:32,253
Just like that.

80
00:03:33,838 --> 00:03:36,341
-He looks so cool.
-Look at his abs.

81
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:37,842
One, two.

82
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:43,306
Great job.

83
00:03:43,973 --> 00:03:44,974
One, two.

84
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:46,726
CHANGE POSITIONS

85
00:03:46,809 --> 00:03:47,894
One, two.

86
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:50,063
One, two.

87
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:51,814
Right.

88
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,524
One, two, hook, right.

89
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:56,694
Hook, right.

90
00:03:57,403 --> 00:03:59,781
STUMBLES

91
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:01,741
So good.

92
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:08,289
You go hard on the last one.

93
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:12,085
Again.

94
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,297
I can't take this.

95
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:18,091
-Let's stop here.
-Sounds good.

96
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:20,260
-Thank you.
-This hurts too much.

97
00:04:22,178 --> 00:04:23,888
I thought I'd never come back to this.

98
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:27,517
I don't know why,
but I always go back to boxing.

99
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:31,229
-Do you still get excited every time?
-Well, I…

100
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:33,856
Yes, that's the case for me.

101
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:37,110
I sometimes fight
in stand-up matches on the side.

102
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:39,404
-So you have two jobs.
-Basically.

103
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:41,906
Thank you.

104
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:47,996
SUDDENLY PRACTICES HIS KICKS

105
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:51,666
You're kicking
like the original stand-up fighters.

106
00:04:53,584 --> 00:04:55,962
Can we try this too?

107
00:04:56,045 --> 00:04:57,839
YEO-JIN AND YOO-JIN JOIN

108
00:04:57,922 --> 00:04:59,549
-What is it good for?
-This?

109
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:02,093
-I want my shoulders to get bigger.
-For your shoulders…

110
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:07,515
YOU MEAN LIKE MY SHOULDERS?

111
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:12,186
Wow, you have a great body.

112
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:14,480
EMBARRASSED

113
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:16,607
SNEAKS BY

114
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:19,193
-I'll put this away. You can teach them.
-Okay.

115
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:21,821
I'm just a newbie.

116
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:25,616
THE OWNER LEAVES

117
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:27,660
I'm so thirsty.

118
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:35,335
-They're having a good time at the gym.
-Really?

119
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:37,503
It's like people are flirting.

120
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:39,297
-Flirting?
-It's kind of like…

121
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:41,174
-That's exciting.
-We're by the sea.

122
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:43,885
There's a gym
where men can show off their muscles,

123
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:46,471
and the ladies are asking them
to teach them.

124
00:05:46,554 --> 00:05:48,056
-One!
-One!

125
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:49,682
-Now, two!
-Two!

126
00:05:50,224 --> 00:05:51,476
-Three!
-Three!

127
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:53,019
-Four!
-Four!

128
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:56,397
CHUNG-IL'S HARDCORE TRAINING

129
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:57,982
My nose is getting runny!

130
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:05,406
I'm so happy that people are flirting
and having fun.

131
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,661
It's like we're at an amusement park
I built, and the…

132
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:13,081
What should I call them? Not hamsters but…

133
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:14,540
-The young folks.
-Right.

134
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:18,920
I seriously need to change.
I'm sick of wearing this.

135
00:06:19,003 --> 00:06:21,047
How long have I been wearing this?

136
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:22,381
DAY 2

137
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:23,883
DAY 3

138
00:06:23,966 --> 00:06:25,134
DAY 4

139
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:26,385
DAY 5

140
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:28,054
AND TODAY

141
00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:29,305
My energy is limited.

142
00:06:29,388 --> 00:06:31,974
Since I didn't spend much energy
on appearance,

143
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:33,643
I could focus on other things.

144
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:37,855
I flattened my hair with water.
That's about it.

145
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:42,443
FIRST TIME CHANGING IN 5 DAYS

146
00:06:43,027 --> 00:06:44,445
BUT HE STILL KEEPS THE SAME SHORTS

147
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:46,364
-Thank you.
-For what?

148
00:06:46,447 --> 00:06:48,783
Thanks for offering to work out with me.

149
00:06:48,866 --> 00:06:50,827
-But I wasn't much help.
-No, you were.

150
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:55,414
It's been too long for me,
so I had trouble landing a hit.

151
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:58,126
-Would you like a gummy?
-I'd love one.

152
00:06:58,209 --> 00:07:00,002
GUMMY TIME AFTER WORKING OUT

153
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:04,674
-Don't you miss it?
-Not the people, but I miss my hometown.

154
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:06,717
-I bet you do.
-I miss my friends.

155
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:10,888
I'd like to visit the school I went to.

156
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:15,059
Sometimes, I would zoom in on Google Maps
to see my hometown.

157
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:18,062
-Does it show up?
-It doesn't. It's blurry.

158
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:18,980
I see.

159
00:07:20,022 --> 00:07:22,400
I used to hate my mother.

160
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:26,446
-Why?
-She left me when I was too young.

161
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:28,865
-Because she came here first?
-Yes.

162
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:31,367
My father passed away
when I was 11 years old.

163
00:07:32,201 --> 00:07:33,828
He got shot on his way…

164
00:07:33,911 --> 00:07:35,746
-To where?
-To here.

165
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:40,168
My mom knew it'd be difficult
to take care of the two of us.

166
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:43,004
She figured she'd come here first
and then come get us later.

167
00:07:43,087 --> 00:07:45,548
But that's not as easy as it sounds.

168
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:47,884
So you and your sister
lived all by yourselves?

169
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:50,052
-Yes.
-How did you feed yourselves?

170
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:53,431
She left exactly 28 kg of maize rice
when she left.

171
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:57,643
It was enough for an 11-year-old
and a 12-year-old to last for a month.

172
00:07:57,727 --> 00:08:01,481
Even now, it's hard for kids that age
to live on their own.

173
00:08:02,064 --> 00:08:05,943
Your mother must've felt
horrible at the time.

174
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:07,528
Yes, she did.

175
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:10,448
Now I'm thankful for her.

176
00:08:10,531 --> 00:08:14,160
It's all thanks to her
that we're able to enjoy this lifestyle.

177
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:16,496
You know, I seriously think

178
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:20,500
I'll remember this experience
for the rest of my life.

179
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:21,417
-Really?
-Yes.

180
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:23,336
-Thank you.
-When I came here…

181
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:27,340
I realized that
you're a lot kinder than I expected.

182
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:29,634
-Me?
-Yes, I was really surprised.

183
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:31,886
-Thanks.
-I mean it.

184
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:35,848
-I still have a long way to go.
-You're a lot more gentle than I thought.

185
00:08:36,432 --> 00:08:38,184
-You're gentle too.
-Right.

186
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:41,687
MEANWHILE IN THE KITCHEN

187
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:43,731
TODAY'S CHEF

188
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:45,233
WASHES HER HANDS

189
00:08:46,275 --> 00:08:47,151
Oh my.

190
00:08:47,735 --> 00:08:48,653
Oh, it's working.

191
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:53,658
I should use it all up.

192
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:55,451
WHAT IS YE-EUN COOKING?

193
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:59,830
Hello, everyone.
This is Ji Ye-eun's cooking class.

194
00:09:00,414 --> 00:09:03,125
Today, I'll be making
buckwheat noodles with perilla oil.

195
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:05,795
First, I'm going to boil the noodles.

196
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:07,755
It's the most important step.

197
00:09:07,838 --> 00:09:09,715
JI YE-EUN'S COOKING CLASS

198
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:12,885
You have to keep stirring
because there's not much water.

199
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:14,971
YE-EUN'S TIP
DO NOT RUSH WHEN COOKING NOODLES

200
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:21,310
There's no need to rush in life either.

201
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:24,772
Take it slowly
and you'll get there someday.

202
00:09:24,855 --> 00:09:26,232
Wherever that is.

203
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:29,026
SLOWLY COOKS THE NOODLES

204

212
00:10:06,063 --> 00:10:07,565
I'll make the spicy fish stew.

213
00:10:08,482 --> 00:10:09,942
-Are you going to cook pork?
-Yes.

214
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:11,360

219
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:34,800
THE SECRET TO SPICY FISH STEW

222
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:52,818
-What time is it?
-I think it's around 8:10 p.m.

223
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:54,654
Let's eat dinner now.

224
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:56,656
Come down, everyone.

225
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:01,702
-I can do it.
-You're good at that.

226
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:03,788
-You're strong.
-I am.

227
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:04,705
It's soft here.

228
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:07,875
I wasn't sure how much to make.

229
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:10,503
DISTRIBUTING THE BUCKWHEAT NOODLES
WITH PERILLA OIL

230
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:12,922
Let's sit in a circle.

231
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:17,468
It feels like we're getting offerings
at a Buddhist temple.

232
00:11:17,551 --> 00:11:19,512
IT'S LIKE STAYING AT A TEMPLE

233
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:20,429
Let's eat.

234
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:21,430
-Okay.
-Yes.

235
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:22,556
I haven't washed my hands.

236
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,474
-Okay.
-Yes.

237
00:11:23,557 --> 00:11:25,476
-I haven't washed my hands.
-Let's do that.

238
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:27,436
-We're eating with our hands?
-Well, we want…

239
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,564
We want the new guests to experience this.

240
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:31,899
Oh, I'm okay with that.

241
00:11:31,982 --> 00:11:34,527
I LIKE THAT IDEA

242
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:38,781
THE NEW GUESTS EAT WITH THEIR HANDS

243
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:39,990
I'm wearing gloves.

244
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:41,826
THE OTHERS WEAR PLASTIC GLOVES

245
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:43,160
Are we the only ones?

246
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:45,621
THE OWNER IS WITH YOU

247
00:11:45,704 --> 00:11:48,666
-Please enjoy your meal.
-Thanks for the meal.

248
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:53,879
I ate like this when I was little.

249
00:11:55,923 --> 00:11:57,133
Hey, Ye-eun!

250
00:11:57,716 --> 00:11:58,551
It's so good.

251
00:11:58,634 --> 00:12:00,136
Thanks for the meal.

252
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:03,722
Hey, Ye-eun!

253
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:06,392
Isn't it good?

254
00:12:06,475 --> 00:12:07,810
This is delicious.

255
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:10,229
-Great job, Ye-eun.
-Right?

256
00:12:10,312 --> 00:12:11,564
-It's good.
-It's amazing.

257
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:13,482
The seasoning is perfect.

258
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:16,777
-This is delicious.
-Yeah.

259
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:17,903
It's really good.

260
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:19,655
-Ye-eun's a good cook.
-Honestly.

261
00:12:19,738 --> 00:12:21,449
You're good at cooking.

262
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:23,409
-It's so delicious, right?
-Yes.

263
00:12:25,953 --> 00:12:26,871
What's wrong?

264
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:28,205
I can't eat this.

265
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:31,750
Because there's no more left.

266
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:35,087
-What the heck was that?
-I want more.

267
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:38,090
-There's no more left.
-Then I really can't eat this.

268
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:40,426
I wish I could make more.

269
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:42,720

272
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:50,227
So this is…

273
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:54,273
This is so good.

274
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:02,406
WIPES ON HIS THIGH

275
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:06,035
ADDICTED TO EATING WITH HER HANDS

276
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:07,036
It's good.

277
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:11,999
You eat so naturally with your hands.

278
00:13:12,082 --> 00:13:13,000
This is great.

279
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:17,129
How did you adapt so fast?
It's like you've been here for days.

280
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:21,800
THEY EAT THE FISH PLATTER
THEY CAUGHT IN THE FISH TRAP

281
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:26,639
SATISFIED WITH HIS FISH TRAP PLAN

282
00:13:26,722 --> 00:13:28,599
-Since we're almost done…
-Okay.

283
00:13:28,682 --> 00:13:32,394
Jin and I booked a squid boat.

284
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:33,979
Squid boat?

285
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:37,525
THE ICON OF THE ULLEUNGDO ISLAND
IN THE EAST SEA

286
00:13:38,817 --> 00:13:40,694
SQUID FISHING BOAT

287
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:43,489
THE SQUID CAUGHT OVERNIGHT

288
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:46,659
ARE SOLD AT THE AUCTION DURING DAWN

289
00:13:49,411 --> 00:13:51,455
We'll catch squid
and enjoy them with some drinks.

290
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:52,540
THE SQUID BOAT APPROACHES

291
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:54,500
Be careful.

292
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:56,877
The boat's shaking a lot.

293
00:13:56,961 --> 00:13:59,088
THEY'RE OFF TO CATCH SOME SQUID AS A SNACK

294
00:14:00,297 --> 00:14:02,883
I can't believe I'm on a squid boat.

295
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:04,593
I don't know if we'll catch any.

296
00:14:05,135 --> 00:14:07,054
We have an hour, so maybe we will.

297
00:14:08,472 --> 00:14:10,140
It's so bright.

298
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:12,893
So that's the squid boat. I'm excited.

299
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:16,981
THEY ARRIVE AT THE SQUID FISHING SPOT

300
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:20,943
-This must be the squid fishing spot.
-Right.

301
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:22,945
KIAN'S B&B
KIAN, JIN

302
00:14:23,862 --> 00:14:25,030
He's lowering the machine.

303
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:26,073
MANUAL JIGGER FOR SQUID

304
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:27,449
What do we do, sir?

305
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:29,034
-You lower the line.
-Yes.

306
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:32,162
-When the squid bites, you'll feel it.
-I see.

307
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:34,290
Then you pull it back up.

308
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:37,501
-We should try not to tangle the line.
-Oh, I see.

309
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:39,128
THE LINE CAN'T BE TANGLED

310
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:42,506
-Do you think we'll catch some in an hour?
-Yes.

311
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:48,637
-I also…
-It's here.

312
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:53,100
ALREADY?

313
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:54,852
Here it comes.

314
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:56,520
Here it comes.

315
00:14:57,354 --> 00:14:58,939
-We caught one.
-That was fast.

316
00:15:07,948 --> 00:15:10,367
CAUGHT ONE IN 5 MINUTES

317
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:12,786
Give it a try.

318
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:16,248
Poor squid. Why do I feel so bad?

319
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:24,506
-It's really big.
-Yeah.

320
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:25,549
It's still breathing.

321
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:30,220
Why do I feel bad? I want to let it go.

322
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:33,807
Watch out. It'll squirt ink.

323
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:36,727
-Don't octopus squirt ink?
-Squid can do it too.

324
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:37,728
Really?

325
00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:41,523
We've got this now, sir.

326
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:46,278
I'm sorry.

327
00:15:47,821 --> 00:15:48,822
I'm sorry.

328
00:15:51,575 --> 00:15:53,327
I didn't understand what he was thinking.

329
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:54,578
LOOKS AWAY

330
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:01,710
He's an odd duck.

331
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:05,172
I hope you're reborn
as a son of a rich family.

332
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:13,389
-Do you feel it?
-I don't know.

333
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:20,020
CAUGHT ONE

334
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:21,271
Jeez, I got one!

335
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:25,818
CAUGHT ANOTHER ONE

336
00:16:25,901 --> 00:16:26,902
Nice.

337
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:30,489
CAUGHT TWO IN A ROW

338
00:16:30,572 --> 00:16:31,907
I caught two!

339
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:34,451
Every time I caught one,

340
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:38,622
I screamed because it was so exciting.

341
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:40,082
It was fun.

342
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:42,501
STARES

343
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:47,881
When I met eyes with the squid,
I saw it still breathing.

344
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:50,759
It even made a sad sound.

345
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:54,138
I felt bad for it, but it was also cute.
I pitied it.

346
00:16:54,888 --> 00:16:57,016
-Do you want to try?
-Okay.

347
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:01,020
THE OWNER'S TURN

348
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:03,522
Let's catch two more.

349
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:05,983
NOT SO EXCITED

350
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:09,445
I just felt bad when I saw its eyes.

351
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,281
I have this weird pity for them.

352
00:17:13,657 --> 00:17:15,117
Poor squid.

353
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:19,538
Keep turning it.

354
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:24,752
Let's get just enough.

355
00:17:25,335 --> 00:17:27,671
-Let's go back after this.
-Okay.

356
00:17:32,509 --> 00:17:33,886
Nice one!

357
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:35,637
You got it.

358
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:37,598
We caught four.

359
00:17:38,348 --> 00:17:40,017
That's plenty. Let's go now.

360
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,186
We caught plenty.

361
00:17:47,649 --> 00:17:49,068
I can't even look at them.

362
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:55,074
It keeps staring at me.

363
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:57,618
-That was fun.
-Was it?

364
00:17:57,701 --> 00:17:59,244
-It wasn't bad.
-Really?

365
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:02,289
CAUGHT 4 ULLEUNGDO ISLAND SQUID

366
00:18:02,372 --> 00:18:03,749
Which way are you going up?

367
00:18:03,832 --> 00:18:06,126
Shouldn't we show them what we caught?

368
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:07,586
PASSES 3 SQUID THROUGH THE WINDOW

369
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:09,630
THE REMAINING ONE

370
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,217
CAREFULLY FOLDS IT

371
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:15,803
GOES IN HIS POCKET

372
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:17,513
You're putting it in your pocket?

373
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:26,855
-They're back.
-Welcome back.

374
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:28,774
Did you catch any squid?

375
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:31,151
The squid provides us with mulhoe.

376
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:32,528
TAKES IT OUT

377
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:35,197
That's amazing!

378
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,824
Why did it come out of your pocket?

379
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:39,368
-It's looking at him.
-We caught four.

380
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:40,285
Really?

381
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:42,746
-I'll prepare it and serve it to you.
-That's so great.

382
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:45,499
It's easy to prepare these.

383
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,298
WASHES THEM CAREFULLY

384
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:55,634
They're so excited.

385
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:58,387
Hey, guests.

386
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:02,182
Is this real?

387
00:19:02,766 --> 00:19:04,810
THE OWNER'S SPECIAL
ULLEUNGDO ISLAND SQUID SASHIMI

388
00:19:04,893 --> 00:19:07,688
I'm kind of proud.
I'm glad we didn't come empty-handed.

389
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:11,984
I need to pee so bad.

390
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:14,528
I have to pee.

391
00:19:15,362 --> 00:19:16,405
Oh gosh.

392
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:20,701
I can't hold it in.

393
00:19:29,918 --> 00:19:31,545
-Thank you.
-Enjoy.

394
00:19:31,628 --> 00:19:33,338
-Go ahead.
-Thank you.

395
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:34,798
I have to go pee.

396
00:19:35,382 --> 00:19:36,216
Go ahead and eat.

397
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:40,220
-Dig in, everyone.
-Thank you.

398
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:43,807
It's really tender.

399
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:46,310
-This is delicious.
-Yeah.

400
00:19:46,393 --> 00:19:48,020
Because it's straight out of the sea.

401
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:49,688
-It's delicious.
-It's the best.

402
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:50,939
PROUD

403
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:52,274
Let's go to bed now.

404
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:57,154
-Where's your bed, Yoo-jin?
-Over here.

405
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:00,490
Wow, this is so fun.

406
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:03,827
What do you want for dinner tomorrow?

407
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:06,371
-Stewed pork and kimchi.
-That sounds amazing.

408
00:20:06,955 --> 00:20:08,165
Stewed pork and kimchi?

409
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:11,919
Everyone needs to wear
both the top and bottom straps.

410
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:15,380
This is so much fun. I can't fall asleep.

411
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:21,720
DAY 7

412
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:28,852
EMPTY

413
00:20:29,436 --> 00:20:32,397
WHERE IS EVERYONE?

414
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:35,817
THE OWNER IS STILL ASLEEP

415
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:39,738
EVERYONE IS AWAKE EXCEPT HIM

416
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:44,618
ZONES OUT

417
00:20:45,994 --> 00:20:48,121
GLANCES

418
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:57,172
HERE COMES THE SLIDE POLICE

419
00:20:57,881 --> 00:21:00,050
-I thought you weren't watching.
-Sir.

420
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:02,678
We're operating under strict rules here.

421
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:04,846
-You can't do that.
-Okay, got it.

422
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:07,224
EMBARRASSED

423
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,935
STICKS TO THE RULES

424
00:21:14,314 --> 00:21:15,315
It's nice and cool.

425
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:36,295
TELLING ON HIM

426
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:38,380
What are you doing, dear guest?

427
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:41,091
-Chang-jun…
-Dang it.

428
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:43,468
GOES BACK DOWN

429
00:21:45,345 --> 00:21:47,139
THE OWNER'S PHONE RINGS

430
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:48,307
Kian.

431
00:21:50,934 --> 00:21:53,562
Your phone's ringing, Boss.

432
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:54,855
YE-EUN IS CHANGING TRASH BAGS

433
00:21:54,938 --> 00:21:57,399
YEO-JIN DELIVERS THE PHONE

434
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:03,238
-Hello?
-Yes?

435
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:05,866
MORE GUESTS?

436
00:22:05,949 --> 00:22:07,993
-Where are you?
-I'm at a port.

437
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:09,619
Are you at Hyeonpo Port?

438
00:22:10,537 --> 00:22:12,247
Our staff will be right there, so hold on.

439
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:13,790
-You're picking me up?
-Yes.

440
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:14,958
-Okay.
-See you.

441
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:22,090
-Ye-eun.
-Yes?

442
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:24,509
-You have to go pick someone up.
-Who?

443
00:22:25,093 --> 00:22:26,428
Well, he…

444
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:29,222
He's going to take my place for a day.

445
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:32,350
I have to shoot I Live Alone.

446
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:33,268
7 DAYS AGO

447
00:22:33,351 --> 00:22:35,103
Where are you going?

448
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:36,563
The shoot is only for a night.

449
00:22:36,646 --> 00:22:37,856
OWNER'S 24-HOUR BUSINESS TRIP

450
00:22:37,939 --> 00:22:40,317
You're leaving everything
up to the two of us?

451
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,943
-I called someone over.
-Who?

452
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:43,153
A REPLACEMENT WILL COME

453
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:48,909
I feel terrible
about bringing a world star here

454
00:22:48,992 --> 00:22:51,495
and going off to do my own thing.

455
00:22:51,578 --> 00:22:56,750
I couldn't cancel it because it had
already been scheduled a while back.

456
00:22:57,709 --> 00:23:00,504
WHO IS THE PART-TIME WORKER?

457
00:23:00,587 --> 00:23:01,880
I'm worried, to be honest.

458
00:23:03,757 --> 00:23:06,259
PART-TIME WORKER
KWAK JOON-BIN

459
00:23:06,343 --> 00:23:09,471
Kian said he'll be away for one night.

460
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:12,265
I hope I can fill his shoes.

461
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:15,227
It's my third time
on Ulleungdo Island this year.

462
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:17,020
It's only been two weeks since I was here.

463
00:23:17,104 --> 00:23:18,105
ULLEUNGDO ISLAND EXPERT

464
00:23:18,188 --> 00:23:19,397
I know all about this place.

465
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:23,193
I know the restaurants and tourist spots,
so the guests will like that.

466
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:29,157
There's no way…

467
00:23:30,325 --> 00:23:31,618
What is that?

468
00:23:33,036 --> 00:23:34,204
That can't be it.

469
00:23:34,287 --> 00:23:35,372
Joon-bin!

470
00:23:37,457 --> 00:23:39,251
-Who's calling me?
-Joon-bin!

471
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:41,837
Hey, Joon-bin!

472
00:23:42,879 --> 00:23:48,176
I'm on another show with Joon-bin,
so I've known him for a while.

473
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,845
I was so happy to see him.

474
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:51,888
Joon-bin!

475
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:55,642
Are you driving right now?
You can drive a boat?

476
00:23:56,476 --> 00:23:57,561
I got a license.

477
00:23:57,644 --> 00:23:58,895
-Really?
-Yes, really.

478
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:00,689
-Wait.
-Ride this.

479
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:02,315
-Ride what?
-The banana boat.

480
00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:04,276
No, I'm too scared to ride that.

481
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:06,987
-I really can't.
-We have all the equipment.

482
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:09,156
-I still can't.
-You have no choice.

483
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:11,908
-Please go easy on me.
-Okay.

484
00:24:11,992 --> 00:24:14,286
I know you're a scaredy-cat.

485
00:24:14,369 --> 00:24:16,204
-Just get on.
-But I…

486
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:19,416
Oh gosh. I forgot to tell my mom.

487
00:24:19,499 --> 00:24:21,501
A 32-YEAR-OLD WHO NEEDS MOM'S PERMISSION

488
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:23,461
Just hurry up and get on.

489
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:26,631
It's too early to be riding a banana boat.

490
00:24:28,091 --> 00:24:30,010
I'm scared, so you'd better chill out.

491
00:24:31,678 --> 00:24:32,721
Here we go.

492
00:24:33,388 --> 00:24:34,973
Where's the B&B?

493
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:36,850
IT'S ON THE OCEAN

494
00:24:39,352 --> 00:24:42,439
I'm seriously scared, Ye-eun.

495
00:24:42,522 --> 00:24:45,942
-I'm going to take revenge on you.
-Sure.

496
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:47,819
Jeez…

497
00:24:48,403 --> 00:24:50,197
Why a banana boat?

498
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,157
Just trust me, Joon-bin.

499
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,075
We can only depend on each other.

500
00:24:56,453 --> 00:24:58,830
PAST THE BREAKWATER AND INTO THE OCEAN

501
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:00,540
There's nothing in the ocean.

502
00:25:01,541 --> 00:25:03,084
It's tilting!

503
00:25:04,252 --> 00:25:06,922
THE BOAT IS CLEARLY TILTING

504
00:25:08,256 --> 00:25:10,550
THE BOAT IS FLOODED

505
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:13,929
What is that? Is that it?

506
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:16,973
-We're here.
-That's a B&B?

507
00:25:17,515 --> 00:25:19,768
Damn.

508
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:23,313
Dang, it's huge.

509
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:24,940
Is this really it?

510
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,108
Oh, they're back.

511
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:29,361
-Who's on the boat?
-Who is it?

512
00:25:29,444 --> 00:25:30,570
I'm so curious.

513
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:33,240
-Someone's on the banana boat.
-Hello.

514
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:36,284
-It's Kwak Joon-bin.
-Hello!

515
00:25:39,412 --> 00:25:41,081
-It's Kwak Joon-bin.
-Hello.

516
00:25:41,164 --> 00:25:42,707
This place is amazing.

517
00:25:43,416 --> 00:25:44,834
THE PART-TIME WORKER ARRIVES

518
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:46,253
-Do you like it?
-Yes.

519
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:48,505
It's like a castle.

520
00:25:48,588 --> 00:25:49,422
HEY, JOON-BIN

521
00:25:49,506 --> 00:25:52,300
-Long time no see.
-Yeah, hurry on up here.

522
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:54,928
We filmed a YouTube video together.

523
00:25:55,011 --> 00:25:57,222
I was happy to see him here.

524
00:25:57,305 --> 00:26:01,017
He's really smart and quick-witted.

525
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:03,728
I thought it was a great idea
to bring him here.

526
00:26:04,854 --> 00:26:05,981
Hello.

527
00:26:06,523 --> 00:26:08,650
-Is this funny, Joon-bin?
-Hey, Kian.

528
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:11,403
You thought
you were replacing the boss, right?

529
00:26:11,486 --> 00:26:13,947
-Yes.
-No, you're the newbie here.

530
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:15,031
JOB-FISHED

531
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:16,908
-I thought I'd be the manager.
-You're not.

532
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:20,745
I wish I could put you in charge,
but you don't know anything.

533
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:23,081
Listen to your superiors, okay?

534
00:26:23,581 --> 00:26:25,458
FIRST, LET'S GO UP

535
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:27,168
-There's no door.
-What?

536
00:26:28,378 --> 00:26:30,547
-You can do it, right?
-I'm sure you can.

537
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:32,841
I'll explain, so come this way.

538
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:34,843
THE PART-TIME WORKER'S FIRST OBSTACLE

539
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:36,636
-Did you design this?
-Yes.

540
00:26:37,178 --> 00:26:39,306
I SHOULDN'T HAVE COME

541
00:26:43,184 --> 00:26:44,644
-You're doing well.
-He's climbing.

542
00:26:44,728 --> 00:26:47,689
I thought you'd find it difficult,
but you're getting there.

543
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:49,190
You have to get used to it.

544
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:50,984
Shit, this is so damn scary.

545
00:26:51,818 --> 00:26:56,364
-Oh, Joon-bin is afraid of heights.
-This is horrifying.

546
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:58,450
-He's afraid of heights.
-Wait, don't pull me.

547
00:26:58,533 --> 00:26:59,534
It's so scary.

548
00:26:59,617 --> 00:27:02,162
THE PART-TIME WORKER
WHO'S AFRAID OF HEIGHTS

549
00:27:02,245 --> 00:27:06,082
Give me a moment. I even got seasick.

550
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:07,625
PLUS SEASICKNESS

551
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:09,252
Come to think of it,

552
00:27:09,336 --> 00:27:12,839
there are so many things here
that you wouldn't like.

553
00:27:12,922 --> 00:27:15,967
I can't swim or climb, and I get seasick.

554
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:18,595
This place is perfect.

555
00:27:20,388 --> 00:27:24,059
This place has everything you hate.

556
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:25,769
KIAN'S B&B IS TOO PERFECT FOR JOON-BIN

557
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:28,021
TEACHING HIM THE ROPES

558
00:27:28,104 --> 00:27:30,857
Once the guests are out,
you have to clean up.

559
00:27:31,441 --> 00:27:33,193
You have to clean and do the laundry.

560
00:27:33,276 --> 00:27:35,403
PART-TIME WORKER'S TO-DO LIST
1. CLEANING AND LAUNDRY

561
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:41,409
Also, some people take off the straps
in their sleep.

562
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:43,203
-You have to keep an eye on it.
-Really?

563
00:27:43,286 --> 00:27:45,330
2. CHECK THE BED SAFETY

564
00:27:45,413 --> 00:27:47,499
You have to keep lining up the slippers.

565
00:27:47,582 --> 00:27:49,167
It can look messy.

566
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:51,419
3. TIDY UP THE SLIPPERS

567
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:53,254
I'm usually the one
who cleans the bathroom.

568
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:54,422
4. CLEAN THE BATHROOM

569
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:56,049
-Can you clean it?
-Yes.

570
00:27:57,884 --> 00:27:59,386
We need to clean now.

571
00:27:59,469 --> 00:28:00,595
PUTS HIM TO WORK RIGHT AWAY

572
00:28:01,262 --> 00:28:04,099
We need to do the laundry today.

573
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:05,892
We have to gather the towels.

574
00:28:05,975 --> 00:28:08,061
I'll gather them. You guys should relax.

575
00:28:08,144 --> 00:28:10,271
The boss taught me well.

576
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:12,440
Please give me your towels.

577
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:13,608
STARTING WITH THE LAUNDRY

578
00:28:14,484 --> 00:28:16,277
-Towels.
-Please give me your towels.

579
00:28:18,905 --> 00:28:20,365
PLEASED

580
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:26,955
This is fun.

581
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:32,669
They did this for a week?
That must have been tough.

582
00:28:42,929 --> 00:28:45,181
-Do you need to wash it?
-I just need to rinse it.

583
00:28:45,265 --> 00:28:48,560
-I'll do it for you.
-No, I'm going to wear it today.

584
00:28:48,643 --> 00:28:50,103
How old are you?

585
00:28:50,186 --> 00:28:52,689
-I'm 33 years old.
-So you were born in 1992.

586
00:28:52,772 --> 00:28:54,274
THE SAME AGE

587
00:28:54,357 --> 00:28:56,860
You can speak casually with me.

588
00:28:56,943 --> 00:28:57,944
No, I can't do that.

589
00:28:58,027 --> 00:29:00,488
Jin didn't hesitate at all.

590
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:03,158
Kian told me to treat the guests well…

591
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:04,409
Let me help.

592
00:29:04,492 --> 00:29:05,618
JIN JOINS THEM

593
00:29:17,714 --> 00:29:18,840
I'm tired.

594
00:29:21,134 --> 00:29:22,135
Here you go.

595
00:29:29,058 --> 00:29:31,728
THE LAUNDRY IS DONE

596
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,689
THE OWNER IS CLEANING THE KITCHEN

597
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:38,610
THOROUGH

598
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:42,155
WORKING HARD BEFORE HE LEAVES

599
00:29:42,822 --> 00:29:44,616
FINDS SOMETHING

600
00:29:44,699 --> 00:29:46,951
SOCKS AND TRASH

601
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:47,869
The socks are here?

602
00:29:49,537 --> 00:29:51,039
THE TRASH GOES IN HIS POCKET

603
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:53,500
If trash falls out, I put it in my pocket.

604
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:55,043
I've gotten used to it.

605
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:59,798
I have to get rid of it first
because I want to keep it clean.

606
00:30:03,259 --> 00:30:05,762
BUT THE SOCKS REMAIN ON THE FLOOR

607
00:30:07,931 --> 00:30:10,391
SMELLS THEM WITHOUT THINKING

608
00:30:11,893 --> 00:30:15,563
THE SOCKS GO IN HIS POCKET TOO

609
00:30:16,564 --> 00:30:18,233
Shouldn't you go now?

610
00:30:19,692 --> 00:30:21,361
-I'm counting on you, Jin.
-Okay.

611
00:30:21,444 --> 00:30:22,821
-I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

612
00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:24,781
DON'T WORRY, BOSS

613
00:30:24,864 --> 00:30:26,241
I'm counting on you.

614
00:30:27,742 --> 00:30:29,327
-Take care.
-Bye.

615
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:30,578
Good luck.

616
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:32,163
-Enjoy your stay.
-I will.

617
00:30:32,247 --> 00:30:34,082
-Good luck.
-Bye.

618
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:35,166
Take care.

619
00:30:44,884 --> 00:30:47,345
This doesn't feel right, though.

620
00:30:50,807 --> 00:30:53,434
-Don't worry about a thing.
-Okay, I'll be back.

621
00:30:55,103 --> 00:30:56,354
My heart feels heavy.

622
00:30:56,437 --> 00:30:58,565
THE OWNER HEADS TO SEOUL

623
00:30:58,648 --> 00:31:00,024
It's Kian's B&B without Kian.

624
00:31:00,984 --> 00:31:05,446
KIAN'S B&B WITH NO KIAN

625
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:06,781
-Are you leaving?
-Yes.

626
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:08,032
We're exploring the area.

627
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:12,287
-I'll give you some recommendations.
-We want to go to a pretty cafe.

628
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:14,205
There's a foot spa cafe over there.

629
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:15,874
-That sounds nice.
-It does.

630
00:31:15,957 --> 00:31:18,877
You can just look up
"Olleh Foot Spa Cafe."

631
00:31:21,296 --> 00:31:23,131
A travel YouTuber knows his stuff.

632
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:24,924
AS EXPECTED OF A TRAVEL YOUTUBER

633
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:26,426
Let's go.

634
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:29,512
I hope they're in here.

635
00:31:29,596 --> 00:31:30,805
CHUNG-IL LOOKS FOR SOMETHING

636
00:31:35,518 --> 00:31:37,186
Where did the lenses fall off?

637
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:39,397
THE LENSES FELL OFF HIS SUNGLASSES

638
00:31:48,865 --> 00:31:51,784
I bought these for this trip,
but you can have them.

639
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:55,246
Keep them.

640
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:57,707
-You're so generous.
-That's amazing.

641
00:31:57,790 --> 00:31:59,667
What's your purpose?

642
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:01,753
Are you doing this to look good?

643
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:04,172
How can I wear these?

644
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:06,341
-Just wear them.
-Thank you so much.

645
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:09,093
-That's amazing.
-What an honor.

646
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:14,515
They look good on you, Chung-il.

647
00:32:15,516 --> 00:32:16,517
He looks cool.

648
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:18,853
-You look great, Chung-il.
-Thanks.

649
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:20,980
It'll be a family heirloom.

650
00:32:21,731 --> 00:32:23,900
Don't mention it. They really suit you.

651
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:27,654
Let's go, everyone.

652
00:32:28,655 --> 00:32:29,864
It's time to leave.

653
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:37,205
You can get off now.

654
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:39,290
-Thanks, Ye-eun.
-Thank you.

655
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:40,583
Thanks for the ride, Ye-eun.

656
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:41,960
-Have fun.
-Enjoy your day.

657
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:42,877
-Okay.
-You too.

658
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:45,838
THE GUESTS GO SNORKELING

659
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:53,763
AND THE STAFF IS OUT FOR LUNCH

660
00:32:53,846 --> 00:32:56,349
-What else is good around here?
-Barnacle kalguksu.

661
00:32:56,432 --> 00:32:57,517
That sounds amazing.

662
00:32:58,059 --> 00:32:59,394
-I'd love that.
-It's good.

663
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:01,354
LUNCH WILL BE KALGUKSU
RECOMMENDED BY JOON-BIN

664
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:05,191
Kian's incredible.
I never imagined it would look like that.

665
00:33:06,901 --> 00:33:09,487
It's my first time coming this way.
It's pretty here.

666
00:33:15,576 --> 00:33:17,370
The mountains are beautiful.

667
00:33:21,874 --> 00:33:22,917
ARRIVED AT THE RESTAURANT

668
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:25,086
-This place is famous.
-I want porridge.

669
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:27,171
You need a porridge storage?

670
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:29,382
LOOK AT THIS GUY

671
00:33:30,383 --> 00:33:31,676
Hey, Joon-bin.

672
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:33,136
I love puns like that.

673
00:33:33,219 --> 00:33:34,387
Thank goodness.

674
00:33:35,096 --> 00:33:37,390
I FOUND MY SOULMATE

675
00:33:37,473 --> 00:33:38,516
Give me one, mate.

676
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:40,643
What happens when a king gets hit?

677
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:42,061
HESITATES

678
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:43,479
It's "King Gong."

679
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:45,064
HAHAHA

680
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:47,191
What does a king do
when he loses something?

681
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:48,151
He's a "search king"?

682
00:33:48,234 --> 00:33:50,445
No, he's "look-king."

683
00:33:51,738 --> 00:33:52,989
Do you have one, Ye-eun?

684
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:56,451
I got one.
What did one ocean say to another ocean?

685
00:33:56,534 --> 00:33:57,702
Nothing. It just waved.

686
00:33:59,746 --> 00:34:00,913
You got it right.

687
00:34:01,497 --> 00:34:02,665
You're not there yet.

688
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:06,210
This place looks good.

689
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:08,546
Thank you.

690
00:34:09,922 --> 00:34:11,299
-I'm excited.
-Thank you.

691
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:13,342
JOON-BIN'S RECOMMENDED RESTAURANT

692
00:34:13,926 --> 00:34:15,428
The noodles are special here.

693
00:34:16,095 --> 00:34:17,889
They mix in ground barnacles.

694
00:34:18,431 --> 00:34:20,308
BARNACLE KALGUKSU

695
00:34:21,809 --> 00:34:23,519
SEASONED WITH NUTTY BARNACLE INNARDS

696
00:34:24,103 --> 00:34:26,147
One barnacle porridge.

697
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:28,941
One spicy squid salad.

698
00:34:30,276 --> 00:34:32,361
DOKDO SHRIMP STEW

699
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:39,660
This is delicious.

700
00:34:42,622 --> 00:34:43,956
The porridge is good too.

701
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,875
I crave this when I'm back in Seoul.

702
00:34:50,588 --> 00:34:51,923
-Do you like it?
-Yes.

703
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:53,508
I want shrimp too.

704
00:34:55,593 --> 00:34:57,011
The food here is great.

705
00:34:57,595 --> 00:34:58,554
I want shrimp too.

706
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:03,101
-Do you want me to peel it for you?
-Yes.

707
00:35:03,184 --> 00:35:04,644
YES, PLEASE

708
00:35:04,727 --> 00:35:06,104
You're pretty sweet.

709
00:35:06,687 --> 00:35:08,439
SWEET JOON-BIN

710
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:09,941
What about me?

711
00:35:12,026 --> 00:35:13,444
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

712
00:35:14,028 --> 00:35:15,780
ONE FOR YE-EUN

713
00:35:15,863 --> 00:35:16,781
ONE FOR JIN

714
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:17,990
Thank you.

715
00:35:18,741 --> 00:35:19,700
Eat up.

716
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:22,912
It's so good.

717
00:35:22,995 --> 00:35:24,247
I love this.

718
00:35:25,164 --> 00:35:26,290
That was a good meal.

719
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:28,459
Let's go, guys.

720
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:36,467
I don't think you're aware,
but you've been here for a week.

721
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:37,885
It's been seven days already?

722
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:41,389
Should we have fun
to celebrate your seventh day?

723
00:35:41,472 --> 00:35:43,558
Yeah, let's have fun.

724
00:35:44,225 --> 00:35:48,604
The guests come back at 7 p.m.,
so we need to be back at the B&B by 5 p.m.

725
00:35:48,688 --> 00:35:50,273
PONDERS

726
00:35:50,356 --> 00:35:52,233
The staff also needs rest.

727
00:35:52,316 --> 00:35:55,945
You're supposed to get time off
for working a whole week.

728
00:35:56,028 --> 00:36:00,074
By law,
you have to take a break from work.

729
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:01,534
WAS THAT GOOD, YE-EUN?

730
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:04,954
Isn't it Monday today?

731
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:09,125
It's Sunday… No, it's Monday.

732
00:36:09,208 --> 00:36:11,085
You didn't take the weekend off, so…

733
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:12,628
NO CHANCE

734
00:36:12,712 --> 00:36:15,882
We came to the island on Tuesday.
It's only been six days.

735
00:36:15,965 --> 00:36:17,800
-You worked as soon as you got here.
-Right.

736
00:36:17,884 --> 00:36:22,138
Shouldn't we clean the floors
while Joon-bin is here?

737
00:36:23,639 --> 00:36:25,725
I'm just a part-time worker.

738
00:36:25,808 --> 00:36:27,476
I'll do what the boss says.

739
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,603
Let's go back now.

740
00:36:30,938 --> 00:36:33,733
-I mean, what do you want to do?
-I want to go to a cafe.

741
00:36:33,816 --> 00:36:36,652
-Okay, let's go.
-I'm so excited.

742
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:38,821
This place is pretty.

743
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:42,825
The view is really nice here.

744
00:36:45,244 --> 00:36:49,415
AFTER ENJOYING A QUICK BREAK

745
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:53,794
The guests haven't had much to eat,
so I'll get some snacks.

746
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:55,129
We're going back then.

747
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:56,297
Let's go.

748
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:57,882
JIN AND JOON-BIN HEAD BACK

749
00:36:57,965 --> 00:37:00,051
Off we go.

750
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:05,431
MEANWHILE, KIAN'S B&B
RETURNS TO THE BREAKWATER

751
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:07,850
MOVE COMPLETE

752
00:37:07,934 --> 00:37:08,935
JIN AND JOON-BIN RETURN

753
00:37:09,018 --> 00:37:10,561
I'll make the rice and stew.

754
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:12,355
-So we're doing the work?
-Yes.

755
00:37:12,438 --> 00:37:13,648
I'll do the hard job.

756
00:37:14,357 --> 00:37:18,653
I'll tidy up everything
before the guests arrive.

757
00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:20,279
-Should I mop the floor?
-Yes.

758
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:22,073
TO-DO LIST
JIN: PUT AWAY GROCERIES, COOK

759
00:37:22,156 --> 00:37:23,866
JOON-BIN: CLEAN THE INSIDE
AND THE BATHROOM

760
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:24,951
You're good at that.

761
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:26,827
It's heavy.

762
00:37:28,037 --> 00:37:30,206
-Here.
-Thank you.

763
00:37:30,289 --> 00:37:31,165
Good luck.

764
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:34,585
Who even drinks this much alcohol?

765
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:35,878
PUTS AWAY THE GROCERIES

766
00:37:36,462 --> 00:37:39,340
What is this? I forgot to buy rice.

767
00:37:40,007 --> 00:37:41,300
-Joon-bin.
-Yes?

768
00:37:41,384 --> 00:37:44,053
Can you go to the convenience store
and buy some rice?

769
00:37:44,136 --> 00:37:45,846
Should we ask Ye-eun?

770
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:47,598
-Ask her to get some.
-Got it.

771
00:37:47,682 --> 00:37:49,767
YE-EUN, PLEASE BUY RICE ON THE WAY BACK
OKAY!

772
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:52,645
-I'm going to clean the bathroom.
-Okay.

773
00:37:53,729 --> 00:37:54,897
I haven't gone there yet.

774
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:57,441
I'm the one who usually cleans
the bathroom. Can you clean it?

775
00:37:57,525 --> 00:37:59,026
THE OWNER'S REQUEST
CLEAN THE BATHROOM

776
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:04,782
MORBID

777
00:38:11,372 --> 00:38:12,873
PROPS THE DOOR OPEN

778
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:21,841
CLEANING BRUSH IN HAND

779
00:38:21,924 --> 00:38:24,135
I should clean it while I'm here.

780
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:26,595
CLEANS EVERY CORNER

781
00:38:29,932 --> 00:38:31,892
EVERY NOOK AND CRANNY

782
00:38:35,062 --> 00:38:36,939
CLEANS THOROUGHLY

783
00:38:38,107 --> 00:38:40,776
CLEAN-UP DONE

784
00:38:52,455 --> 00:38:55,416
TONIGHT'S DINNER
STEWED PORK AND KIMCHI

785
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,502
Wow, the kimchi is fermented well.

786
00:38:58,586 --> 00:39:00,129
LOTS OF KIMCHI

787
00:39:00,212 --> 00:39:01,922
This is the pork.

788
00:39:02,548 --> 00:39:04,300
AND LOTS OF MEAT

789
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:09,221
Hello?

790
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:12,391
-Hello.
-Hello.

791
00:39:12,475 --> 00:39:14,393
We'd like to check in.

792
00:39:14,477 --> 00:39:15,811
-Check in?
-Yes.

793
00:39:15,895 --> 00:39:16,896
Can you come by 7 p.m.?

794
00:39:16,979 --> 00:39:18,564
THE TEMPORARY OWNER GIVES INSTRUCTIONS

795
00:39:18,647 --> 00:39:20,524
You have to come to Hyeonpo Port.

796
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:23,361
-Got it.
-Okay, see you.

797
00:39:23,444 --> 00:39:25,446
-Thank you.
-Bye.

798
00:39:26,113 --> 00:39:27,531
Hey, I think it's a couple.

799
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:29,325
-What?
-We have a couple.

800
00:39:30,117 --> 00:39:32,078
-A cuddle?
-A couple!

801
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:35,331
-You want to cuddle?
-I said, "couple."

802
00:39:35,414 --> 00:39:36,665
Cuddle?

803
00:39:36,749 --> 00:39:39,835
Not cuddle but couple!

804
00:39:39,919 --> 00:39:41,212
-A couple?
-Yes.

805
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:44,006
-It's a couple?
-I think so.

806
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:44,924
UNDERSTOOD

807
00:39:45,508 --> 00:39:48,761
This will be
quite a memorable experience for them.

808
00:39:48,844 --> 00:39:49,887
Seriously.

809
00:39:50,763 --> 00:39:52,723
RESUMES COOKING DINNER

810
00:39:56,936 --> 00:39:58,646
A little bit of soybean paste.

811
00:40:03,317 --> 00:40:06,278
BOIL IT FOR A LONG TIME

812
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:08,030
It smells spicy.

813
00:40:09,698 --> 00:40:12,118
I just need to wait for the rice.

814
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:16,831
PAUSES

815
00:40:16,914 --> 00:40:19,125
You have to keep lining up the slippers.

816
00:40:19,208 --> 00:40:20,751
It can look messy.

817
00:40:22,211 --> 00:40:24,046
ORGANIZES THE FOOTWEAR
LIKE HE'S IN HYPNOSIS

818
00:40:29,635 --> 00:40:31,387
IN A STRAIGHT LINE

819
00:40:32,138 --> 00:40:34,098
It's messier than I expected.

820
00:40:34,181 --> 00:40:37,435
Once the guests are out,
you have to clean up.

821
00:40:38,978 --> 00:40:40,146
MOVES EVERYTHING TO ONE SIDE

822
00:40:40,729 --> 00:40:42,815
AND THEN WIPES THE FLOOR WITH A RAG

823
00:40:43,941 --> 00:40:46,235
CLEANING EVERY NOOK AND CRANNY

824
00:40:46,318 --> 00:40:47,778
THOROUGHLY

825
00:40:47,862 --> 00:40:50,114
THE AREA THAT WAS MESSY

826
00:40:50,197 --> 00:40:51,282
It's clean now.

827
00:40:51,365 --> 00:40:53,117
-I'll come down.
-Okay.

828
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,119
IT IS MUCH CLEANER NOW

829
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:03,377
COMING DOWN TO CLEAN THE FIRST FLOOR

830
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:05,045
Be careful on your way down.

831
00:41:06,589 --> 00:41:07,631
Look at these cabinets.

832
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:09,258
It's so Kian-like. Unbelievable.

833
00:41:16,348 --> 00:41:20,561
But, you know,
running a B&B is kind of nice.

834
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:22,271
You greet guests.

835
00:41:22,354 --> 00:41:23,814
THE STEW IS ALSO DONE

836
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:24,940
It's quite fun.

837
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:27,193
I'm done.

838
00:41:27,276 --> 00:41:28,527
DIZZY

839
00:41:29,111 --> 00:41:30,404
We work well together.

840
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:32,364
I rushed over here.

841
00:41:32,448 --> 00:41:34,658
MEANWHILE IN SEOUL

842
00:41:34,742 --> 00:41:38,746
I'm not worried about Jin or Ye-eun,

843
00:41:39,955 --> 00:41:42,166
but I'm a bit worried about Joon-bin.

844
00:41:43,209 --> 00:41:45,044
What are you guys doing right now?

845
00:41:46,587 --> 00:41:48,005
Grab it with your feet.

846
00:41:50,216 --> 00:41:51,091
That's right.

847
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:54,261
Good job. You did your best.

848
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:55,221
I mean it.

849
00:41:55,304 --> 00:41:56,263
I think I can do it.

850
00:41:58,891 --> 00:42:01,769
-Put this on.
-Okay.

851
00:42:01,852 --> 00:42:03,521
Wear it and strap it on.

852
00:42:04,146 --> 00:42:04,980
What?

853
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:06,857
I think I can do it.

854
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:08,651
Give it another try.

855
00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:13,531
SECOND TRY

856
00:42:17,826 --> 00:42:18,994
That's it.

857
00:42:21,163 --> 00:42:22,039
There you go.

858
00:42:22,122 --> 00:42:23,749
I can't. Give me a hand.

859
00:42:28,337 --> 00:42:29,338
Just a little more.

860
00:42:30,256 --> 00:42:32,758
-Pull yourself up at three.
-Okay.

861
00:42:32,841 --> 00:42:34,218
One, two, three!

862
00:42:39,265 --> 00:42:40,349
It was no biggie.

863
00:42:40,432 --> 00:42:41,350
Did you say "piggy"?

864
00:42:41,433 --> 00:42:42,643
I knew you could do it.

865
00:42:43,352 --> 00:42:44,353
Thanks for the help.

866
00:42:45,062 --> 00:42:46,146
Joon-bin!

867
00:42:46,814 --> 00:42:47,940
What's in your hand?

868
00:42:48,607 --> 00:42:50,150
-It's a gift.
-Really?

869
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:51,735
CAME BACK WITH SNACKS FOR THE GUESTS

870
00:42:51,819 --> 00:42:53,612
-Ye-eun is here.
-Okay.

871
00:42:54,154 --> 00:42:56,282
Should I put the rice here?

872
00:42:56,365 --> 00:42:58,576
-Ye-eun!
-Can I put it here?

873
00:42:58,659 --> 00:43:00,661
-What is it?
-Gosh.

874
00:43:00,744 --> 00:43:02,037
What's wrong?

875
00:43:02,121 --> 00:43:03,914
THE RICE YE-EUN BOUGHT

876
00:43:03,998 --> 00:43:04,915
Here.

877
00:43:05,457 --> 00:43:08,168
-I can't go back up.
-No, I'm over here.

878
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:11,547
-Look here.
-I can't go back up.

879
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:13,841
-No, I'm here.
-Oh, there you are.

880
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:16,844
-No, I'm here.
-Oh, there you are.

881
00:43:17,678 --> 00:43:18,762
SORRY

882
00:43:18,846 --> 00:43:20,598
-Over here.
-Good idea.

883
00:43:21,557 --> 00:43:23,183
-Hey.
-I'm exhausted.

884
00:43:23,684 --> 00:43:25,728
Did you buy bread for the guests?

885
00:43:25,811 --> 00:43:27,646
Yeah, I did.

886
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:29,231
You can't come up this way.

887
00:43:30,482 --> 00:43:31,817
Not this way. Go up that way.

888
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:33,235
HERE COMES THE NEW SLIDE POLICE

889
00:43:33,319 --> 00:43:36,113
I think you're mistaken.
This is the way down.

890
00:43:36,697 --> 00:43:40,200
You've got it, Joon-bin!
Hey, climb the wall.

891
00:43:40,284 --> 00:43:42,911
-But it's raining.
-It's not raining.

892
00:43:42,995 --> 00:43:45,706
Kian asked me to do this.

893
00:43:45,789 --> 00:43:47,666
-Jeez…
-He said to stick to the rules.

894
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:48,751
Go that way!

895
00:43:48,834 --> 00:43:51,045
THIS IS RIDICULOUS

896
00:43:51,128 --> 00:43:52,796
MEANWHILE, THE GUESTS

897
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:53,797
This is crazy.

898
00:43:53,881 --> 00:43:54,757
I'm really excited.

899
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:55,841
HAKPO PORT

900
00:43:55,924 --> 00:43:57,009
I can't wait to dive in.

901
00:43:57,092 --> 00:43:58,594
I can't wait. It'll be fun.

902
00:43:58,677 --> 00:43:59,678
SNORKELING TOGETHER

903
00:44:01,263 --> 00:44:03,641
-It's so nice.
-The water is so clear.

904
00:44:08,354 --> 00:44:10,856
There's a ton of fish.

905
00:44:11,523 --> 00:44:12,983
It's really cool here.

906
00:44:14,276 --> 00:44:15,819
-It's emerald colored.
-Right.

907
00:44:15,903 --> 00:44:18,781
Ulleungdo Island is beautiful
in a very unique way.

908
00:44:21,033 --> 00:44:22,993
Chung-il, can you pick that up?

909
00:44:24,787 --> 00:44:26,038
What is it?

910
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:32,127
CHUNG-IL FOUND A SEA SNAIL

911
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:35,881
CHANG-JUN ALSO FOUND ONE

912
00:44:35,964 --> 00:44:37,299
This is amazing.

913
00:44:38,258 --> 00:44:39,760
This is so much fun.

914
00:44:50,896 --> 00:44:51,730
7 P.M.

915
00:44:51,814 --> 00:44:52,690
I'll be right back.

916
00:44:53,357 --> 00:44:55,609
YE-EUN GOES TO PICK UP THE GUESTS

917
00:44:55,692 --> 00:44:57,569
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

918
00:45:01,448 --> 00:45:02,825
-Hello.
-Did you have fun?

919
00:45:02,908 --> 00:45:03,784
We did.

920
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:07,454
We're going to wait for some new guests.

921
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:08,956
-Are they joining us?
-Yes.

922
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:10,040
That's exciting.

923
00:45:10,999 --> 00:45:12,918
-That's a relief.
-I think that's them.

924
00:45:13,001 --> 00:45:13,961
That must be them.

925
00:45:14,044 --> 00:45:15,129
THE NEW GUESTS HAVE ARRIVED

926
00:45:16,213 --> 00:45:17,714
Do you have everything, baby?

927
00:45:17,798 --> 00:45:20,551
-I think that's it, baby.
-What?

928
00:45:20,634 --> 00:45:22,678
-Seriously?
-I think so.

929
00:45:22,761 --> 00:45:26,473
Hello, Kian's B&B guests.
Please get on the boat.

930
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:27,891
Get on the boat?

931
00:45:27,975 --> 00:45:30,811
Hello, please get on.

932
00:45:30,894 --> 00:45:32,354
Okay, we'll be there.

933
00:45:32,438 --> 00:45:34,606
-Hello.
-Nice to meet you.

934
00:45:34,690 --> 00:45:36,150
Nice to meet you.

935
00:45:36,233 --> 00:45:38,652
-Are you two a couple?
-Yes, we are.

936
00:45:38,735 --> 00:45:40,529
HOLDING HANDS TIGHTLY

937
00:45:41,864 --> 00:45:43,740
-I'm so jealous.
-Me too.

938
00:45:43,824 --> 00:45:46,201
-Let's get going.
-Okay.

939
00:45:46,743 --> 00:45:47,911
How old are you?

940
00:45:47,995 --> 00:45:49,830
-I was born in 2001.
-Sorry?

941
00:45:49,913 --> 00:45:51,665
-Did you say 2001?
-Yes.

942
00:45:51,748 --> 00:45:52,916
That's right.

943
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,793
REALLY?

944
00:45:54,877 --> 00:45:57,004
I was born in 2001,
and she was born in 1997.

945
00:45:57,087 --> 00:45:59,756
KIM JEONG-HUI, BORN IN 1997
KIM BO-SEUNG, BORN IN 2001

946
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:00,716
SHE'S OLDER THAN HIM

947
00:46:00,799 --> 00:46:02,217
They're so cute together.

948
00:46:02,301 --> 00:46:03,635
Oh, that's cool.

949
00:46:05,179 --> 00:46:06,388
You can get off now.

950
00:46:08,265 --> 00:46:09,475
It really looks bizarre.

951
00:46:11,059 --> 00:46:12,895
HOLDS HER HAND

952
00:46:14,563 --> 00:46:15,606
Welcome, everyone.

953
00:46:17,316 --> 00:46:18,650
Nice to meet you.

954
00:46:18,734 --> 00:46:20,819
This is Kian's B&B.

955
00:46:20,903 --> 00:46:23,614
There's no door on the first floor.

956
00:46:23,697 --> 00:46:25,782
You need to climb the wall to get inside.

957
00:46:25,866 --> 00:46:26,742
BEWILDERED

958
00:46:26,825 --> 00:46:28,160
That's the entrance?

959
00:46:28,243 --> 00:46:30,037
Yes, this is the entrance.

960
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:31,914
-Oh my.
-Let's go up first.

961
00:46:32,498 --> 00:46:33,999
Do it like this. I see.

962
00:46:34,082 --> 00:46:35,501
-Be careful, Jeong-hui.
-I will.

963
00:46:35,584 --> 00:46:37,252
Just wait for your turn, baby.

964
00:46:39,004 --> 00:46:41,590
-"Wait for your turn, baby."
-He's so sweet.

965
00:46:42,257 --> 00:46:45,093
He cares more about her safety than his.

966
00:46:46,094 --> 00:46:48,263
-You can do this.
-You've got this.

967
00:46:48,764 --> 00:46:49,765
She's doing it so well.

968
00:46:49,932 --> 00:46:50,807
CLIMBS UP QUICKLY

969
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:52,476
Why is she so good?

970
00:46:54,770 --> 00:46:56,480
EXCITED

971
00:46:58,440 --> 00:46:59,399
Why is she so good?

972
00:47:00,067 --> 00:47:01,276
She's good.

973
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:02,319
Good job.

974
00:47:02,945 --> 00:47:03,987
You've got this.

975
00:47:04,571 --> 00:47:06,949
BO-SEUNG ALSO CLIMBS UP QUICKLY

976
00:47:08,867 --> 00:47:11,995
THE OTHER GUESTS ENTER AS WELL

977
00:47:12,913 --> 00:47:14,540
-Hello.
-Hello.

978
00:47:14,623 --> 00:47:15,958

FIRST GREETING

Welcome to Kian's B&B. I'm Joon-bin84.

981
00:47:19,461 --> 00:47:20,504
But why are you…

982
00:47:21,129 --> 00:47:23,799
I'M TRAPPED HERE

983
00:47:23,882 --> 00:47:25,217
Please help me up.

984
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:26,593
-One moment.
-We've got you.

985
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:28,262
-I got him.
-You got him?

986
00:47:28,345 --> 00:47:30,806
-One second.
-Two, three.

987
00:47:33,809 --> 00:47:36,478
CAUGHT A BIG FISH

988
00:47:36,562 --> 00:47:39,022
-Nice to meet you.
-That was a weird entrance.

989
00:47:39,106 --> 00:47:40,440
AN EMBARRASSING ENTRANCE

990
00:47:40,524 --> 00:47:42,901
WELCOME TO KIAN'S B&B WITH NO KIAN

991
00:47:42,985 --> 00:47:44,444
How do you know each other?

992
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:45,737
She's my girlfriend.

993
00:47:45,821 --> 00:47:47,155
-You're not married?
-No.

994
00:47:47,239 --> 00:47:49,658
-There's something more shocking.
-What is it?

995
00:47:49,741 --> 00:47:52,661
-Are you younger than her?
-Yes, I am.

996
00:47:52,744 --> 00:47:55,706
-He's four years younger.
-I see.

997
00:47:55,789 --> 00:47:57,040
I was born in 2001.

998
00:47:57,124 --> 00:47:59,960
-You're 24 and 28 years old.
-Yes.

999
00:48:00,043 --> 00:48:03,922
-What do you do?
-I'm an optician. I make glasses.

1000
00:48:04,506 --> 00:48:06,842
What about you, Bo-seung?

1001
00:48:06,925 --> 00:48:07,968
I'm in college.

1002
00:48:08,051 --> 00:48:08,969
HE'S A STUDENT

1003
00:48:09,052 --> 00:48:11,013
FIRST COUPLE GUESTS
JEONG-HUI AND BO-SEUNG

1004
00:48:11,096 --> 00:48:12,264
Should we eat now?

1005
00:48:12,347 --> 00:48:15,559
But it's stewed pork and kimchi.
Should we give them spoons?

1006
00:48:15,642 --> 00:48:17,811
I think we should. This is really hot.

1007
00:48:17,894 --> 00:48:20,188
I think we should. This is really hot.

1008
00:48:20,272 --> 00:48:21,690
What are you talking about?

1009
00:48:21,773 --> 00:48:23,942
-We eat with our hands.
-"Give them spoons"?

1010
00:48:26,278 --> 00:48:28,447
WHY ARE THEY DISCUSSING THIS?

1011
00:48:29,031 --> 00:48:30,532
We usually eat with our hands.

1012
00:48:30,616 --> 00:48:33,285
But today's dish is hot,
so we should hand out spoons.

1013
00:48:33,368 --> 00:48:35,203
Let's just give them spoons.

1014
00:48:35,287 --> 00:48:37,039
What about forks?

1015
00:48:37,122 --> 00:48:39,583
LOGIC DESTROYED

1016
00:48:40,792 --> 00:48:42,628
Excuse me, Chung-il!

1017
00:48:42,711 --> 00:48:46,214
Please tell everyone
to come down for dinner.

1018
00:48:46,298 --> 00:48:48,634
-Let's go down for dinner, guys.
-Okay.

1019
00:48:50,427 --> 00:48:53,263
-The rice is awesome.
-Wait, how is she coming down so slowly?

1020
00:48:53,347 --> 00:48:56,058
-How are you doing this?
-This looks harder to do.

1021
00:48:56,141 --> 00:48:58,018
How is she doing that?

1022
00:48:59,936 --> 00:49:01,897
How are you coming down in slow motion?

1023
00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:05,567
-She's here.
-How did you do that?

1024
00:49:06,151 --> 00:49:09,988
BO-SEUNG'S FIRST DESCENT

1025
00:49:10,072 --> 00:49:11,948
-Be careful not to burn your hands.
-Okay.

1026
00:49:12,032 --> 00:49:14,618
-What do you call her?
-I call her "baby."

1027
00:49:14,701 --> 00:49:15,911
BABY

1028
00:49:17,496 --> 00:49:18,664
That's so sweet.

1029
00:49:18,747 --> 00:49:20,749
-Do you ever call her by her name?
-No.

1030
00:49:21,416 --> 00:49:22,834
Hey, Chung-il, my baby.

1031
00:49:22,918 --> 00:49:24,836
CHUNG-IL, MY BABY

1032
00:49:26,755 --> 00:49:28,340
Hey, Myeong-gyun, baby.

1033

JIN'S BABIES

1034
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:34,471
-She made that look so easy.
-She slid down at once.

1035
00:49:35,347 --> 00:49:36,890
This place is interesting.

1036
00:49:36,973 --> 00:49:40,727
-Hey, you have something on your face.
-Where?

1037
00:49:42,396 --> 00:49:44,773
-Sorry, I should've noticed.
-That's so sweet.

1038
00:49:44,856 --> 00:49:46,191
-So sweet.
-Oh my.

1039
00:49:46,983 --> 00:49:48,485
-Thanks.
-It's my fault.

1040
00:49:49,152 --> 00:49:50,070
Ye-eun.

1041
00:49:50,696 --> 00:49:52,114
Stop it.

1042
00:49:53,115 --> 00:49:56,827
DINNER WITH THE BABIES

1043
00:49:56,910 --> 00:49:58,662
TONIGHT'S DINNER
STEWED PORK AND KIMCHI

1044
00:49:58,745 --> 00:49:59,705
This is crazy.

1045
00:49:59,788 --> 00:50:01,623
Everyone was down for this.

1046
00:50:01,707 --> 00:50:04,710
We simply mentioned it, but you heard us.

1047
00:50:04,793 --> 00:50:07,921
We'll give you spoons tonight
because the food is too hot.

1048
00:50:08,004 --> 00:50:08,839
Thank you.

1049
00:50:08,922 --> 00:50:10,716
We've been eating with our fingers.

1050
00:50:10,799 --> 00:50:12,426
We ate with our hands here.

1051
00:50:13,593 --> 00:50:14,803
Back in my day…

1052
00:50:15,637 --> 00:50:17,097
We got lucky.

1053
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:18,974
THEY'RE HUNGRY AFTER A LONG, FUN DAY

1054
00:50:19,057 --> 00:50:20,726

Ye-eun, come over here.

1058
00:50:25,856 --> 00:50:26,690
THE TEMPORARY OWNER

1059
00:50:26,773 --> 00:50:27,607
Thank you.

1060
00:50:27,691 --> 00:50:29,401
SCOOPS UP FOOD FOR THE STAFF FIRST

1063
00:50:35,907 --> 00:50:37,784
-This looks great.
-Bon appétit.

1064
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:39,995
-Thanks for the meal.
-Bon appétit.

1065
00:50:40,078 --> 00:50:41,705
-Enjoy.
-This looks amazing.

1066
00:50:41,788 --> 00:50:43,707
IT'S BOUND TO BE GOOD

1067
00:50:46,042 --> 00:50:46,918
It's delicious.

1068
00:50:48,378 --> 00:50:49,379
It really is.

1069
00:50:49,463 --> 00:50:51,173
The kimchi is great.

1070
00:50:55,969 --> 00:50:58,555
This is really good.
It's like I'm at a restaurant.

1071
00:50:58,638 --> 00:51:00,182
This is fantastic.

1072
00:51:05,896 --> 00:51:07,564
PLEASED

1073
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:12,402
There was a lot more to think about
when I was in charge.

1074
00:51:13,069 --> 00:51:15,280
I was impressed with Kian
for what he's done.

1075
00:51:15,363 --> 00:51:17,240
Is anyone leaving tomorrow?

1076
00:51:17,324 --> 00:51:20,827
THE JOB-SEEKER TEAM
IS CHECKING OUT TOMORROW

1077
00:51:20,911 --> 00:51:22,871
-The four of you are friends, right?
-Yes.

1078
00:51:22,954 --> 00:51:24,581
-And you're here alone.
-Yes.

1079
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:26,875
You're very brave.

1080
00:51:26,958 --> 00:51:28,043
-What?
-Excuse me?

1081
00:51:28,126 --> 00:51:29,669
Did you say "grave"?

1082
00:51:29,753 --> 00:51:31,338
I said, "brave."

1083
00:51:31,963 --> 00:51:35,133
Oh, we thought you called us depressing.

1084
00:51:35,217 --> 00:51:36,718
-"Brave."
-It stung.

1085
00:51:36,802 --> 00:51:37,969
It was a compliment.

1086
00:51:39,012 --> 00:51:40,680
-How did you…
-How did you meet?

1087
00:51:40,764 --> 00:51:41,890
I want to know.

1088
00:51:41,973 --> 00:51:43,892
-We…
-We met at work.

1089
00:51:45,435 --> 00:51:46,520
What kind of job?

1090
00:51:46,603 --> 00:51:48,772
We worked at a Thai restaurant.

1091
00:51:48,855 --> 00:51:50,857
MET WHILE HE WAS A PART-TIME WORKER

1092
00:51:52,359 --> 00:51:53,819
Who asked whom out first?

1093
00:51:53,902 --> 00:51:55,737
-I did, but…
-Yes?

1094
00:51:55,821 --> 00:51:59,491
We were walking,
and I asked her how she felt about me.

1095
00:52:00,492 --> 00:52:02,744
-But she said she needed to go home.
-Why?

1096
00:52:02,828 --> 00:52:06,915
So I convinced her for 30 minutes
to go on a date with me.

1097
00:52:06,998 --> 00:52:08,333
-You convinced her?
-How?

1098
00:52:08,416 --> 00:52:10,210
-I was convinced.
-How?

1099
00:52:10,293 --> 00:52:12,337
-You didn't like him at first?
-I know, right?

1100
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:14,840
I also thought
we would end up dating anyway.

1101
00:52:16,258 --> 00:52:17,259
That's so cute.

1102
00:52:19,010 --> 00:52:20,720
I finished it so fast.

1103
00:52:21,304 --> 00:52:23,974
EVERYONE DOES THEIR OWN DISHES

1104
00:52:24,057 --> 00:52:27,269
Do you need something, Jeong-hui?

1105
00:52:27,352 --> 00:52:29,980
-Is this the only exit?
-Yes.

1106
00:52:30,063 --> 00:52:32,274
I'd better take my socks off.
Can I do this?

1107
00:52:32,357 --> 00:52:34,943
-Give it a try.
-We have a rescue team.

1108
00:52:35,026 --> 00:52:36,486
CHUNG-IL'S RESCUE TEAM IS ON STANDBY

1109
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:38,363
I don't think I can do this.

1110
00:52:38,446 --> 00:52:40,615
WIPING IT SO IT'S NOT SLIPPERY

1111
00:52:40,699 --> 00:52:42,117
Step on my shoulder.

1112
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:44,077
CHANG-JUN IS WAITING ON TOP

1113
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:46,496
Here I go. Thank you.

1114
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:48,123
Thank you.

1115
00:52:48,206 --> 00:52:49,082
This is…

1116
00:52:52,210 --> 00:52:54,296
LOGIC DESTROYED ONCE AGAIN

1117
00:52:54,379 --> 00:52:55,547
How do I do this?

1118
00:52:55,630 --> 00:52:57,173
THEIR SECOND RESCUE

1119
00:52:58,383 --> 00:52:59,885
We still have to climb a bit.

1120
00:52:59,968 --> 00:53:00,886
EYES TREMBLING

1121
00:53:04,180 --> 00:53:06,349
BO-SEUNG HELPS JEONG-HUI
LIKE THE RESCUE TEAM DID

1122
00:53:06,933 --> 00:53:08,101
Here we go.

1123
00:53:09,144 --> 00:53:10,061
What's this?

1124
00:53:11,146 --> 00:53:13,189
-What's this?
-Oh gosh, what do I do?

1125
00:53:13,273 --> 00:53:14,274
-Great.
-As expected.

1126
00:53:14,357 --> 00:53:15,400
RESCUE SUCCESSFUL

1127
00:53:15,483 --> 00:53:17,819
-Are your shoulders okay?
-Yes, I'm okay.

1128
00:53:17,903 --> 00:53:19,362
IT'S BO-SEUNG'S TURN

1129
00:53:19,446 --> 00:53:20,906
Grab it tightly and go.

1130
00:53:20,989 --> 00:53:22,407
GOES UP RIGHT AWAY

1131
00:53:22,490 --> 00:53:23,992
-Good.
-Just like that.

1132
00:53:24,075 --> 00:53:26,036
-You're doing well.
-That's it.

1133
00:53:26,119 --> 00:53:27,787
-There you go.
-Step on that.

1134
00:53:27,871 --> 00:53:29,122
You did it!

1135
00:53:30,457 --> 00:53:33,627
THE RESCUE TEAM'S JOB IS DONE

1136
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:35,462
Let's clean up for the last time.

1137
00:53:35,545 --> 00:53:37,631
-Are we done now?
-Yes.

1138
00:53:37,714 --> 00:53:39,549
It feels like
we did a part-time job together.

1139
00:53:39,633 --> 00:53:41,551
I know. You have to help me up.

1140
00:53:41,635 --> 00:53:42,469
Okay.

1141
00:53:42,552 --> 00:53:44,888
I don't have the energy to go up.

1142
00:53:44,971 --> 00:53:47,057
-Do you want some help?
-Can you lift me?

1143
00:53:47,140 --> 00:53:48,391
-You are 60 kg?
-Yeah.

1144
00:53:48,475 --> 00:53:49,851
I can lift you since I'm 90 kg.

1145
00:53:49,935 --> 00:53:52,103
I never thought I'd need help. Thanks.

1146
00:53:52,812 --> 00:53:54,147
-Here.
-I should wear that.

1147
00:53:56,024 --> 00:53:59,486
TAKING THE JOON-BIN ELEVATOR

1148
00:54:00,070 --> 00:54:01,029
-Can I stand?
-Yes.

1149
00:54:01,112 --> 00:54:02,197
Stand up.

1150
00:54:13,541 --> 00:54:14,542
Here I go.

1151
00:54:14,626 --> 00:54:16,002
-Should I climb on your back?
-Yes.

1152
00:54:16,086 --> 00:54:17,587
JOON-BIN ELEVATOR'S SECOND PASSENGER

1153
00:54:18,546 --> 00:54:19,881
I'm getting up.

1154
00:54:21,883 --> 00:54:23,927
Trust Jin.

1155
00:54:24,010 --> 00:54:26,221
TRUST ME

1156
00:54:36,648 --> 00:54:37,482
I'm still here.

1157
00:54:37,565 --> 00:54:38,400
THERE'S ONE MORE

1158
00:54:38,483 --> 00:54:41,027
-Can you help us?
-Of course.

1159
00:54:41,111 --> 00:54:43,571
-He's going to jump.
-Okay.

1160
00:54:43,655 --> 00:54:46,074
-You just need to pull him up.
-Got it.

1161
00:54:46,616 --> 00:54:48,576
-Jump at the count of three.
-Okay.

1162
00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:50,161
-Jump as high as you can.
-Got it.

1163
00:54:50,245 --> 00:54:51,663
-Hold on to this side.
-Okay.

1164
00:54:52,455 --> 00:54:54,916
-You have to hold on for a moment.
-Okay.

1165
00:54:58,253 --> 00:55:00,005
TAKES OFF

1166
00:55:00,088 --> 00:55:01,339
One, two, three.

1167
00:55:02,257 --> 00:55:03,466
One, two, three.

1168
00:55:04,384 --> 00:55:05,260
One, two, three.

1169
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:12,684
Damn it.

1170
00:55:17,522 --> 00:55:19,983
Thank you. Welcome to Kian's B&B.

1171
00:55:20,066 --> 00:55:21,234
That was so funny.

1172
00:55:22,861 --> 00:55:25,196
-Please choose a bed.
-We didn't choose yet.

1173
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:27,323
This is where you sleep.

1174
00:55:27,407 --> 00:55:29,242
-We sleep here?
-Yes.

1175
00:55:29,325 --> 00:55:31,578
-Do we sleep outdoors?
-Did I hear that right?

1176
00:55:31,661 --> 00:55:34,164
-The top beds are empty.
-The top?

1177
00:55:34,247 --> 00:55:35,957
BOTH ARE EMPTY

1178
00:55:36,041 --> 00:55:38,126
-Through this window.
-I guess that's us.

1179
00:55:38,209 --> 00:55:39,294
The top is nice.

1180
00:55:39,377 --> 00:55:42,839
I couldn't believe
we were sleeping out there.

1181
00:55:43,339 --> 00:55:45,133
MEANWHILE, JEONG-HUI

1182
00:55:45,967 --> 00:55:48,178
LOOKS AROUND THE TOP FLOOR
WITHOUT HESITATION

1183
00:55:50,597 --> 00:55:51,556
It's nice, right?

1184
00:55:51,639 --> 00:55:53,058
-Do you get rained on?
-Yes.

1185
00:55:53,141 --> 00:55:55,435
-It hasn't happened yet.
-This is cool.

1186
00:55:55,977 --> 00:56:00,440
My dream of sleeping on a terrace bed
came true at Kian's B&B.

1187
00:56:00,523 --> 00:56:02,567
I really liked it.

1188
00:56:03,693 --> 00:56:06,196
-Let's sleep across from each other.
-The top is empty.

1189
00:56:06,279 --> 00:56:07,489
THEY CHOOSE THE THIRD FLOOR

1190
00:56:07,572 --> 00:56:08,907
I guess we'll sleep here.

1191
00:56:08,990 --> 00:56:10,992
-Where do I sleep?
-Joon-bin.

1192
00:56:11,076 --> 00:56:12,911
-Sleep there.
-It's Kian's spot.

1193
00:56:12,994 --> 00:56:15,205
THE OWNER'S SPOT

1194
00:56:15,288 --> 00:56:17,832
Can I switch with someone?
I have a severe fear of heights.

1195
00:56:17,916 --> 00:56:20,877
-I can, but there's a downside.
-Which is?

1196
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:22,420
-It's hard to get up there.
-What?

1197
00:56:22,504 --> 00:56:23,588
You have to climb up.

1198
00:56:23,671 --> 00:56:25,381
-To where?
-You have to go up.

1199
00:56:25,465 --> 00:56:27,300
That's my spot.

1200
00:56:27,383 --> 00:56:29,177
You have to climb up from below.

1201
00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:31,179
-You're not afraid of heights?
-No.

1202
00:56:31,262 --> 00:56:34,099
Even if I were,
I would switch places with you.

1203
00:56:34,182 --> 00:56:35,266
-Damn.
-That's sweet.

1204
00:56:35,350 --> 00:56:36,518
-I mean…
-He's so sweet.

1205
00:56:36,601 --> 00:56:38,269
SO SWEET

1206
00:56:38,353 --> 00:56:39,979
Why are you so sweet?

1207
00:56:40,063 --> 00:56:42,190
CHUNG-IL, JOON-BIN

1208
00:56:46,653 --> 00:56:48,404
Let's make a toast.

1209
00:56:48,488 --> 00:56:49,781
Let's drink together.

1210
00:56:49,864 --> 00:56:53,034
-It's nice to meet you.
-It's great to meet you.

1211
00:56:58,873 --> 00:57:00,959
THE OWNER AT THE SAME HOUR

1212
00:57:01,042 --> 00:57:03,795
I just finished shooting,
and I'm on my way back.

1213
00:57:03,878 --> 00:57:06,673
I'm a bit worried

1214
00:57:07,423 --> 00:57:12,137
if everyone would be lost
without me there.

1215
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:13,596
WHAT DO YOU MEAN "LOST"?

1216
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:15,056
Jin!

1217
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:17,183
CHEERING FOR THE TEMPORARY OWNER

1218
00:57:17,267 --> 00:57:18,560
Jin!

1219
00:57:19,227 --> 00:57:22,021
PAYING THEM BACK WITH A SONG

1220
00:57:22,105 --> 00:57:23,773
With my backpack

1221
00:57:25,316 --> 00:57:27,402
The golden sun

1222
00:57:28,194 --> 00:57:30,613
The festival begins

1223
00:57:31,406 --> 00:57:33,658
Toward the wilderness

1224
00:57:34,284 --> 00:57:36,244
Toward the valley

1225
00:57:36,327 --> 00:57:39,289
Let's look for running water in a valley

1226
00:57:39,372 --> 00:57:42,750
Where we can hear echoes

1227
00:57:42,834 --> 00:57:47,672
Let's take a trip there

1228
00:57:48,465 --> 00:57:49,382
ONE MORE TIME

1229
00:57:49,466 --> 00:57:51,342
Let's look for running water in a valley

1230
00:57:51,426 --> 00:57:54,971
Where we can hear echoes

1231
00:57:55,054 --> 00:58:00,268
Let's take a trip there

1232
00:58:04,063 --> 00:58:05,940
CONTINUED BY A TALENT SHOW

1233
00:58:16,034 --> 00:58:17,327
We have a cameraman there.

1234
00:58:17,410 --> 00:58:19,162
THE CAMERAMAN AT WORK

1235
00:58:19,746 --> 00:58:21,498
CHAOTIC

1236
00:58:24,125 --> 00:58:25,335
THE FORGOTTEN OWNER CONTINUES

1237
00:58:25,418 --> 00:58:28,546
Without me there,
I'm worried that they're…

1238
00:58:28,630 --> 00:58:30,048
WORRYING

1239
00:58:30,131 --> 00:58:32,717
DON'T WORRY

1240
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:36,179
THEY'RE HAVING A BLAST

1241
00:58:37,430 --> 00:58:40,558
-What the heck?
-What is that?

1242
00:58:40,642 --> 00:58:41,643
What the heck?

1243
00:58:41,726 --> 00:58:43,645
A WILD NIGHT AT KIAN'S B&B

1244
00:58:43,728 --> 00:58:46,773
I should go to sleep now.
My voice is cracking.

1245
00:58:47,565 --> 00:58:50,527
Wow, this is so cool.

1246
00:58:51,069 --> 00:58:52,362
I love it here.

1247
00:58:59,285 --> 00:59:02,914
I can't fall asleep.
This is a memory only we can cherish.

1248
00:59:08,628 --> 00:59:10,255
MORNING OF DAY 8

1249
00:59:10,338 --> 00:59:12,423
Hello, guys.

1250
00:59:12,507 --> 00:59:14,300
I'll ride the boat and head back now.

1251
00:59:14,384 --> 00:59:15,635
THE OWNER IS COMING BACK

1252
00:59:15,718 --> 00:59:17,011
See you soon.

1253
00:59:18,429 --> 00:59:19,347
I shaved.

1254
00:59:19,430 --> 00:59:21,599
SHOWING OFF HIS CLEAN FACE

1255
00:59:22,850 --> 00:59:23,810
I'm all clean.

1256
00:59:24,644 --> 00:59:26,646
KIAN'S BIZARRE B&B
