1
00:00:14,514 --> 00:00:17,684
D-1 UNTIL KIAN'S B&B CLOSES

2
00:00:20,812 --> 00:00:23,148
EARLY RISER AS ALWAYS

3
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:35,243
GETTING READY FOR WORK

4
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:43,668
-Baby, did you sleep okay?
-Sorry?

5
00:00:43,752 --> 00:00:45,045
-Did you sleep well?
-Yes.

6
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:50,759
THE GUESTS WAKE UP ONE BY ONE

7
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:53,762
JIN IS STILL ASLEEP

8
00:00:54,387 --> 00:00:57,015
AS WELL AS THE PART-TIMER

9
00:01:00,643 --> 00:01:01,478
GLANCES

10
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:03,229
PEEKS

11
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:05,440
CHECKS IF THE SLIDE POLICE IS SLEEPING

12
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:08,693
-He's not awake yet, so you can do it.
-Yes.

13
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:09,611
THUD

14
00:01:12,113 --> 00:01:14,449
THE SLIDE POLICE WAKES UP

15
00:01:14,532 --> 00:01:17,577
CAUGHT RED-HANDED

16
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:20,455
BUT DOESN'T KNOW YET

17
00:01:23,374 --> 00:01:25,710
-Good morning.
-You're in trouble now.

18
00:01:26,961 --> 00:01:29,714
Tell her to come down
and climb back up properly.

19
00:01:30,298 --> 00:01:33,760
RELAYS THE COMMAND

20
00:01:34,385 --> 00:01:35,220
Who saw me?

21
00:01:36,721 --> 00:01:38,223
I'M WATCHING YOU

22
00:01:42,852 --> 00:01:44,062
-I'm barefoot.
-See you.

23
00:01:44,145 --> 00:01:45,355
Bye.

24
00:01:45,855 --> 00:01:47,899
I should've snuck up quietly.

25
00:01:47,982 --> 00:01:49,192
Gosh, that's hot!

26
00:01:55,865 --> 00:01:58,701
-You're good at climbing.
-I think I can live here.

27
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:00,161
I want to live here.

28
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,708
WASHES UP AFTER CATCHING A CULPRIT

29
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:08,503
You're up early.

30
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:13,216
-Whose bed is this?
-I think it's mine.

31
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:15,760
-Can I lie on it for a bit?
-Of course.

32
00:02:23,726 --> 00:02:26,229
-Oh, no, Ye-eun.
-That must've really hurt.

33
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:29,274
-Oh, dear.
-I'm okay.

34
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:36,322
STARTLED

35
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:37,782
Oh, my.

36
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:39,826
-Ye-eun.
-Are you okay?

37
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:42,871
This feels great.

38
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:45,415
It's so breezy and nice.

39
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:48,543
Isn't today your last day?

40
00:02:48,626 --> 00:02:51,045
THE B&B CLOSES TOMORROW

41
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:06,686
Stretch the other hand.

42
00:03:07,645 --> 00:03:09,856
-To the right.
-I'm so sore right now.

43
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:11,482
Jeez, my arm hurts.

44
00:03:14,235 --> 00:03:16,112
What do you think?
It goes with the vibe here.

45
00:03:16,195 --> 00:03:17,280
It really does.

46
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:19,657
You look adorable,
like a cartoon character.

47
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:26,331
Whose is this?

48
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:27,832
JOON-BIN WAKES UP

49
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:29,292
-Pass it to me.
-Are you up?

50
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:30,960
What do we do now?

51
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:32,670
TODAY'S TO-DO LIST
CHECK OUT THE GUESTS

52
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:34,505
But I just woke up. When do we start?

53
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:37,967
-You woke up too late.
-It feels so nice to sleep here.

54
00:03:39,093 --> 00:03:40,845
We have to write in the guest book.

55
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:48,603
Oh, my goodness.

56
00:03:48,686 --> 00:03:49,896
Wait, you were all here?

57
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:51,731
GATHERED TOGETHER

58
00:03:51,814 --> 00:03:53,316
No wonder it was noisy.

59
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:58,613
Is everyone done packing?

60
00:03:58,696 --> 00:04:00,698
THE JOB-SEEKER TEAM IS CHECKING OUT TODAY

61
00:04:00,823 --> 00:04:02,325
So you're leaving.

62
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:04,369
What a bummer.

63
00:04:04,452 --> 00:04:05,620
It's time to go.

64
00:04:05,703 --> 00:04:07,247
BUMMED

65
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:08,748
This is it.

66
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:12,961
Let's get going.

67
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:15,880
THE JOB-SEEKER TEAM IS CHECKING OUT

68
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:18,424
THE OTHER GUESTS SET OUT ON THEIR TRIPS

69
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:20,969
Kian isn't here,
but let's take a group photo.

70
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:23,846
-Let's take it here.
-The climbing wall is a special memory.

71
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,515
One, two, three.

72
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:29,310
One, two, three.

73
00:04:33,481 --> 00:04:35,191
-Have a safe trip back.
-We will.

74
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:37,402
-Goodbye.
-Thanks for everything.

75
00:04:37,485 --> 00:04:38,736
It's been fun, guys.

76
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,446
-It's been great.
-Thank you.

77
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,073
-Take care.
-Safe travels.

78
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:47,453
Go on now, and don't cry.

79
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:52,959
Get home safe, and good luck!

80
00:04:53,042 --> 00:04:55,044
-Bye.
-Bye, Jin!

81
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:56,087
See you!

82
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:59,632
-Bye, Jin!
-Bye, Jin!

83
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:01,217
Don't go.

84
00:05:03,594 --> 00:05:08,016
Those guys had a way with words,
and our energy levels matched.

85
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:10,018
So, I'll definitely remember them.

86
00:05:12,937 --> 00:05:14,480
Goodbye.

87
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:15,982
-Bye.
-It was nice meeting you.

88
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,651
Don't cry!

89
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:21,279
Take care.

90
00:05:21,362 --> 00:05:23,781
-We had fun.
-Thank you for the memories.

91
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:27,660
When we left, it felt like
being discharged from the military.

92
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:29,787
Kian's B&B is bizarre.

93
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:31,956
It was literally bizarre.

94
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,292
Everything about it was uncomfortable.

95
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:37,128
But that actually made this experience
more memorable.

96
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:41,215
The discomfort lasted a second,
but our memories will last forever.

97
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:45,970
JOB-SEEKER TEAM CHECKS OUT

98
00:05:47,972 --> 00:05:49,807
They're gone. What do we do now?

99
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:54,437
-You should write in the guest book, too.
-Right, I'm leaving, too.

100
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:59,817
BEST OF LUCK TO EVERY GUEST
WHO STAYED AT KIAN'S B&B

101
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:02,070
You're so sentimental.

102
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:03,696
My handwriting is awful.

103
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,073
No, it looks nice.

104
00:06:05,156 --> 00:06:06,949
It looks like callagraphy.

105
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:08,284
It's "calligraphy."

106
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:13,372
We're on leave!

107
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:14,624
MEANWHILE AT CHEONBU PORT

108
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:15,833
ON LEAVE?

109
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:18,503
NEW GUESTS HAVE ARRIVED

110
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:20,213
It's been forever.

111
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:22,173
Being off-duty in Ulleungdo
is even better.

112
00:06:22,256 --> 00:06:24,467
-It feels different.
-And special.

113
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:27,678
NOISY EXCITEMENT

114
00:06:28,387 --> 00:06:29,222
What's that?

115
00:06:33,392 --> 00:06:35,061
We have new guests.

116
00:06:35,144 --> 00:06:38,731
-Hello?
-Hello, we'd like to check in.

117
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:42,193
-What time will you arrive?
-I think we'll be there around 11 a.m.

118
00:06:42,276 --> 00:06:45,279
-Where are you right now?
-We're at Cheonbu Port.

119
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:46,739
Cheonbu Plop?

120
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:50,451
Make sure you don't plop
into the ocean there.

121
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:55,832
Sure, we'll be careful.

122
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:57,375
CAN'T STOP LAUGHING

123
00:06:57,458 --> 00:07:01,170
Give me a call when you arrive
at Hyeonpo Port at 11 a.m.

124
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:04,715
-We'll get to Hyeonpo Port by 11 a.m.
-Thank you.

125
00:07:05,716 --> 00:07:07,009
Wasn't that pretty funny?

126
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:09,387
Don't "plop" into the ocean at the "port."

127
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:12,765
-What do you think?
-Oh, now I get it. That's funny.

128
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:16,352
-Ye-eun, guests are coming at 11 a.m.
-Okay.

129
00:07:16,477 --> 00:07:18,771
We should get ready for check-in.

130
00:07:21,315 --> 00:07:22,483
This is exhausting.

131
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:32,743
What do you think you're doing?

132
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:34,036
WHAT?

133
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,872
Go back down and climb up properly.

134
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:39,000
It's my last day. Give me a break.

135
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,669
NOPE

136
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:44,005
We have to follow the rules.

137
00:07:44,088 --> 00:07:47,091
KIAN'S B&B RULE NEVER TO FORGET:
ENTER VIA THE CLIMBING WALL

138
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:49,802
-I'll go follow the rules.
-You're the best.

139
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:54,432
RULE-ABIDING CITIZEN

140
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:56,267
Everyone has to abide by the rules.

141
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:05,067
-Are you going down?
-I'll see if there's any trash.

142
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:06,819
JIN WILL TIDY UP THE 1ST FLOOR

143
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:08,946
FULL OF DIRTY DISHES

144
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:11,073
REMNANTS OF A WILD NIGHT

145
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:22,585
YE-EUN AND JOON-BIN CLEAN THE 2ND FLOOR

146
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:24,295
PICKS UP TRASH

147
00:08:24,962 --> 00:08:26,380
TIDIES UP

148
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,093
Let's throw away everything in one go.

149
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:42,813
WHOOSH

150
00:08:47,443 --> 00:08:48,903
It feels good to hit that.

151
00:08:48,986 --> 00:08:49,987
-Really?
-Try it.

152
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:51,822
One, two.

153
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:58,371
GIGGLES

154
00:08:58,454 --> 00:09:00,581
I'll go pick up the guests.

155
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,795
THE LAST GUESTS ARRIVE AT HYEONPO PORT

156
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:09,257
-What's that?
-How do we get there?

157
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:11,926
YOU'LL GET THERE BY BOAT

158
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:14,220
Is that Ji Ye-eun? Oh, my God.

159
00:09:14,303 --> 00:09:15,846
Hello.

160
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:19,100
Hello, are you in the Navy?

161
00:09:19,183 --> 00:09:20,476
YES, WE'RE IN THE NAVY

162
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,394
That's right.

163
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:25,356
-You're driving the boat?
-Yes, I got my license.

164
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:30,069
-Let's go.
-This is so cool.

165
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:34,198
This is incredible.

166
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:37,493
-Gosh, look at the B&B.
-I'm beyond amazed.

167
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,620
I never imagined anything like this.

168
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:43,249
-Good morning.
-Hello.

169
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:45,167
-Welcome.
-Are you the owner?

170
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:46,752
-I'm a part-timer.
-Oh, I see.

171
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:50,006
The owner is out at the moment,
but he'll be back soon.

172
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:51,382
-I see.
-Got it.

173
00:09:51,465 --> 00:09:54,760
Hello, I see we have some sailors here.

174
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:56,679
WELCOME

175
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:57,722
Where do you serve?

176
00:09:57,805 --> 00:09:59,390
We serve in Ulleungdo Island.

177
00:09:59,473 --> 00:10:01,017
-The Ulleungdo Navy?
-Yes.

178
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,769
LEE JAE-HYEOK, 22 YEARS OLD

JANG JEONG-HYEON, 25 YEARS OLD
SEAMAN

183
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:14,488
THE ULLEUNGDO NAVY TEAM IS ON LEAVE

184
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:16,532
We have been granted leave.

185
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:18,242
Salute.

186
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:25,374
-Are all of you on leave?
-Yes.

187
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:28,127
What brings you to Kian's B&B?

188
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:31,255
Even though we live here,
we know nothing about it.

189
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:33,883
COMBINED TRIP
OF ULLEUNGDO AND KIAN'S B&B

190
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:35,635
Here's the entrance.

191
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:37,470
IS THAT THE ENTRANCE, SIR?

192
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:39,388
LET'S DO THIS

193
00:10:41,223 --> 00:10:42,850
This is really cool.

194
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:49,106
CLIMBS UP WITHOUT HESITATION

195
00:10:53,694 --> 00:10:55,529
EVERYONE QUICKLY ENTERS

196
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:57,323
SIGHS

197
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:06,123
-Oh, dear.
-Oh, no.

198
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:07,708
I'll never get used to this.

199
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:11,128
LET'S TOUR THE 1ST FLOOR

200
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:13,381
-Do I just slide down the pole?
-Yes.

201
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:16,300
DESCENDS WITHOUT HESITATION

202
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:19,053
Like a true soldier.

203
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:24,016
-That's it.
-Safety first.

204
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:26,435
That was nice and steady.

205
00:11:27,478 --> 00:11:28,979
It's safer than I thought.

206
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:31,482
This is the kitchen.

207
00:11:31,565 --> 00:11:34,318
FLUSTERED

208
00:11:34,443 --> 00:11:36,487
What is this place?

209
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:40,282
The facilities at our base are better,
so I was taken aback.

210
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:42,785
KIAN'S B&B FACILITIES
MAKE YOU MISS THE BARRACKS

211
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:45,746
And we don't provide breakfast here.

212
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:48,791
-We only provide dinner.
-Just dinner.

213
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:51,210
So, if there's anything you want to eat…

214
00:11:51,293 --> 00:11:54,755
-What's your specialty dish?
-I can make whatever you want.

215
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:56,132
Mille-feuille nabe?

216
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:58,926
-Can you make that?
-Shut the door.

217
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:01,345
SHUT THE DOOR

218
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:03,681
-If you're done, you can come on up.
-Please come up.

219
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:08,644
You have to use your feet
to push yourself up.

220
00:12:09,353 --> 00:12:10,896
-Isn't it slippery?
-Nice job.

221
00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:14,483
That's it. You're doing great.

222
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:16,068
The guests are heading out.

223
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:18,362
THE NAVY TEAM WILL GO OUT
RIGHT AFTER THEY CHANGE

224
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:21,282
-Go ahead and get changed.
-Yes, go and get changed.

225
00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:27,621
That's really fast.

226
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:29,457
-Those sailors are cute.
-Seriously.

227
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:32,293
Joon-bin, will you join
our staff meal before you go?

228
00:12:32,376 --> 00:12:33,919
I should update Kian before I go.

229
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:36,672
This place sells
Ulleungdo prime beef for 35,000 won.

230
00:12:36,755 --> 00:12:38,466
TODAY'S LUNCH:
ULLEUNGDO PRIME BEEF BBQ

231
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:40,092
Right, I need to pack.

232
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:41,260
This is everything I have.

233
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:45,890
-What's going on?
-What is it?

234
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:47,683
IS IT A NEW GUEST?

235
00:12:47,766 --> 00:12:49,518
It can't be.

236
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:50,519
Hey!

237
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:51,729
-What is it?
-Why?

238
00:12:52,688 --> 00:12:53,814
It's Kian84.

239
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:57,735
This place feels like home now.

240
00:12:57,818 --> 00:12:59,695
THE OWNER RETURNS AFTER 18 HOURS

241
00:12:59,778 --> 00:13:01,280
I'm home.

242
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:04,200
Hey, Jin.

243
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:06,702
-Are you back in Ulleungdo Island?
-Yes.

244
00:13:06,785 --> 00:13:09,455
-We're going to have one last staff meal.
-Okay.

245
00:13:09,538 --> 00:13:11,665
MEETING THE BOSS AT THE RESTAURANT

246
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:12,583
Let's get going.

247
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:14,251
Let's go.

248
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:17,338
AFTER CHANGING, THE NAVY TEAM SETS OUT

249
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:20,216
JOON-BIN, THE PART-TIME WORKER, CHECKS OUT

250
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:23,302
Goodbye!

251
00:13:24,678 --> 00:13:26,096
-Stop by.
-Have fun.

252
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:28,265
-Thank you.
-Bye.

253
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:30,309
WHERE IS THE NAVY TEAM OFF TO?

254
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:33,395
CHEONBU PORT

255
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:36,148
SNORKELING

256
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:38,150
We've never been here, right?

257
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:40,569
-It's our first time.
-It's nice.

258
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:42,780
WHILE THE NAVY TEAM ENJOYS THEIR TRIP

259
00:13:42,863 --> 00:13:44,615
THE STAFF HEAD TO THE RESTAURANT

260
00:13:44,698 --> 00:13:46,992
-It's so pretty.
-The weather is amazing today.

261
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:49,411
-Look at that view.
-I'm glad the weather is good today.

262
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:50,663
I know, right?

263
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:52,748
It's so nice.

264
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:56,877
This reminds me of the house
in the mountains.

265
00:13:56,961 --> 00:13:59,380
-Maybe we should stop by.
-Totally.

266
00:13:59,463 --> 00:14:01,799
THE NICE WEATHER REMINDS THEM OF THE ANNEX

267
00:14:01,882 --> 00:14:03,259
We had tear gas training there.

268
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:05,135
-There's a training area in the annex?
-Yeah.

269
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:08,389
There's a fireplace there,
but it doesn't have a chimney

270
00:14:08,472 --> 00:14:09,723
or a way for smoke to escape.

271
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:11,892
THE ANNEX HAD A STOVE WITH NO CHIMNEY

272
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:13,894
-So, smoke filled the room.
-It really hurt.

273
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:15,896
I cried three times because of that.

274
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:19,650
JUST LIKE THIS

275
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:20,901
Jeez.

276
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:23,696
ARRIVES AT THE RESTAURANT

277
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:25,281
Is the boss here yet?

278
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:26,699
-Hello.
-Hello.

279
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:29,618
-Come on in.
-It's good to see you.

280
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:30,995
Here you are.

281
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:32,288
-Welcome.
-Boss.

282
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:34,123
HAPPY TO SEE HIM

283
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:35,583
You've lost more weight.

284
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:36,959
-Really?
-Yes.

285
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:38,294
I'll start grilling now.

286
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:39,920
This looks good.

287
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:43,048
-Did you order Ulleungdo prime beef?
-It's brindle beef.

288
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:45,050
ULLEUNGDO BRINDLE BEEF

289
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:46,969
-It's very expensive.
-It looks good.

290
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:48,596
Lunch is on me, so eat up.

291
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:50,931
THE OWNER WILL PICK UP THE TAB

292
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:52,391
Thanks, Boss.

293
00:14:52,474 --> 00:14:54,643
-Thank you, Kian.
-I'm taking a picture.

294
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:58,188
THE BOSS TREATED US TO BBQ

295
00:14:58,272 --> 00:14:59,106
EAT UP

296
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:00,941
This is amazing.

297
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:06,447
This is so good.

298
00:15:09,366 --> 00:15:12,161
Coming back to Ulleungdo Island
felt like coming home.

299
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:15,205
-It feels like home.
-I felt anxious in Seoul.

300
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:16,540
-Really?
-Yes.

301
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:19,251
Did you have more fun
when I wasn't at the B&B?

302
00:15:19,835 --> 00:15:21,795
WHEN YOU WEREN'T AT THE B&B?

303
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:24,673
IT WAS A WILD NIGHT

304
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:27,176
OF COURSE NOT

305
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:28,677
REALLY?

306
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:30,763
A WHITE LIE TO SPARE THE OWNER

307
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:33,724
-Do we have new guests today?
-They already checked in.

308
00:15:33,807 --> 00:15:35,267
TELLS THE OWNER ABOUT THE NEW GUESTS

309
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:36,852
They're Navy sailors.

310
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:38,020
-Really?
-Yes.

311
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:39,813
-They're based in Ulleungdo Island?
-Yes.

312
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:42,024
There are four petty officers
and a seaman.

313
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:43,525
The seaman seemed a bit timid.

314
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:45,778
FEELS BAD FOR HIM

315
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:47,613
-Tomorrow's our last day.
-Right.

316
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:49,490
It's closing too soon.

317
00:15:49,573 --> 00:15:50,866
WHAT?

318
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,576
I mean, you guys can go.

319
00:15:53,869 --> 00:15:56,622
WHAT IS HE TALKING ABOUT?

320
00:15:56,705 --> 00:15:58,457
Jin, I've never seen you so shocked.

321
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:03,545
It's a shame about the annex
in the mountains, too.

322
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:05,631
Then we can come back again next week.

323
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:08,634
-Excuse me?
-You heard him.

324
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:13,389
-I have things to do.
-So do I.

325
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:15,975
ODDLY ENOUGH, THEY'RE BOTH BUSY

326
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:22,481
-We talked about visiting the annex.
-We're considering stopping by.

327
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:25,192
LET'S STOP BY THE ANNEX AFTER LUNCH

328
00:16:25,275 --> 00:16:27,069
-That was a great meal.
-Thank you.

329
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:28,112
Thanks, Boss.

330
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:29,989
-Thanks for lunch, Boss.
-Sure thing.

331
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:31,281
Thank you.

332
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:34,076
THE OWNER ACTUALLY PAYS

333
00:16:35,035 --> 00:16:37,621
OFF TO KIAN'S B&B ANNEX

334
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:43,961
HEADING UP TO THE MOUNTAIN ANNEX

335
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:48,382
Why are we going up so high?

336
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:50,676
BECAUSE THE ANNEX IS HERE

337
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:53,303
AND WE'RE TAKING THE MONORAIL FROM HERE

338
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:55,597
This is too high up. I can't do this.

339
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:57,224
I don't care about your annex!

340
00:16:57,307 --> 00:17:00,310
-Let's go, Joon-bin.
-Go where? What's up there?

341
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:01,770
-The annex.
-The B&B annex.

342
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:03,397
-What's here?
-I really…

343
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,357
ARRIVED AT MONORAIL PLATFORM

344
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:07,151
Hold on a second.

345
00:17:07,234 --> 00:17:08,944
-It's really--
-I can't get on that!

346
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:09,862
Yes, you can.

347
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:11,530
-It's really fine.
-How is it fine?

348
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:14,408
-How can I get on that?
-I promise it's fine.

349
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:17,870
ONE WEEK AGO

350
00:17:17,953 --> 00:17:19,246
This looks scary.

351
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:20,497
I'm scared!

352
00:17:21,248 --> 00:17:23,500
This isn't scary at all.

353
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:25,878
Damn it, what is this thing?

354
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:28,505
-It's nothing.
-How is this nothing?

355
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:30,049
It has seat belts.

356
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:31,425
-Where?
-Right here.

357
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:33,218
They're nice and sturdy.

358
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:35,304
-Get on, Joon-bin.
-It's really safe.

359
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:37,139
This is our mode of transportation.

360
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:39,892
-I seriously can't do this.
-Yes, you can.

361
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:41,852
Say cheese. Let me take a picture.

362
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:47,232
-At least he can smile.
-Hold on tight.

363
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:52,362
-We're off.
-My heart's racing. Is this a tractor?

364
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:54,073
-See you.
-Off you go.

365
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,293
What's so scary about this?

366
00:18:06,376 --> 00:18:08,128
Why is it so steep?

367
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:11,006
Damn it, why is it so steep?

368
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:14,885
This is so scary.

369
00:18:14,968 --> 00:18:18,013
What's so scary?
This is as fast as it goes.

370
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:19,098
Wait a minute.

371
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:28,190
-Are you scared?
-Don't talk to me.

372
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:31,151
-Do you want me to hold your hand?
-I can't let go of the bar.

373
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:34,154
-But the ground is right here.
-I can't look ahead.

374
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:38,575
It's okay now.

375
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:40,953
Hey, this is nice. It's beautiful.

376
00:18:41,036 --> 00:18:42,621
Isn't it pretty?

377
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:46,750
I thought it was amazing my first time.
It felt like I was going on an adventure.

378
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:52,131
I have to admit it's pretty.
When else will I get to ride this?

379
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:55,425
-Here we are.
-That's the B&B annex?

380
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:04,393
-Oh, my.
-Thank you.

381
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:07,729
Welcome, sir.
Let me show you around the house.

382
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:12,901
This is the second location of Kian's B&B.

383
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:16,697
-It looks pretty run-down.
-This here is the entrance.

384
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:19,950
The door…

385
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:23,495
DAY 1

386
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:24,663
The door won't open.

387
00:19:24,746 --> 00:19:25,998
AT A LOSS

388
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:29,251
USED TO IT

389
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:31,128
If you see here…

390
00:19:33,463 --> 00:19:36,425
-The layout is similar to the B&B.
-It's the same.

391
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:38,260
-It's Kian84-style.
-Right.

392
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:39,636
It's got everything.

393
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:42,472
-So this is the training area?
-Exactly.

394
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:45,726
STOVE WITHOUT A CHIMNEY

395
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:47,477
That's crazy.

396
00:19:50,105 --> 00:19:54,276
-It's more modest than the barge.
-But the view here makes it special.

397
00:19:55,944 --> 00:19:57,529
Dang, this view is fantastic.

398
00:19:57,613 --> 00:19:59,031
-Isn't the view amazing?
-Totally.

399
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:03,410
-This place is all about the vibes.
-Yes, it's all about relaxing.

400
00:20:03,493 --> 00:20:05,329
OCEAN VIEW BRIMMING WITH GOOD VIBES

401
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:08,790
Do you see those stairs up there?

402
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:09,750
STARFIELD ZONE

403
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:14,546
That's the only place
where Gen Z kids will drink coffee.

404
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,840
LET'S TAKE SOME PICTURES

405
00:20:17,841 --> 00:20:19,927
Okay, that's good.

406
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,639
SMILES

407
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:26,225
JOON-BIN SMILES, TOO

408
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:32,314
-They're here.
-Are they?

409
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:33,690
Hello.

410
00:20:34,274 --> 00:20:35,943
This place here…

411
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:37,653
We didn't get to use it much.

412
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:40,322
-Hello.
-We should've used the Starfield Zone.

413
00:20:41,156 --> 00:20:43,367
It feels like we're starting over again.

414
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:46,161
-Doesn't it feel a bit strange?
-Yes, it does.

415
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:49,122
This reminds me of our first day.

416
00:20:50,123 --> 00:20:52,167
-It feels weird.
-It does.

417
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:54,378
-It's really weird.
-It's giving me fuzzy feelings.

418
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:02,511
-Goodness.
-Holy cow.

419
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:03,845
This is where…

420
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:06,390
we used to eat.

421
00:21:06,473 --> 00:21:08,892
Why is the door opening smoothly now?

422
00:21:12,187 --> 00:21:15,148
This B&B was actually really nice.

423
00:21:16,566 --> 00:21:18,360
Why is there so much soju here?

424
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:19,528
-Soju?
-Look.

425
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:21,238
Hey, that's green onion.

426
00:21:21,321 --> 00:21:23,031
-There's a lot of it.
-Jeez.

427
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:25,784
This is an emergency food stash.

428
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:28,537
GRABS ALL REMAINING INGREDIENTS

429
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:31,206
-Should we grab everything?
-Yes, just in case.

430
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,583
Grab the towels and slippers, too.

431
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:36,628
-Leave that here.
-Let's go now.

432
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:38,213
-We need a group photo.
-Okay.

433
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:39,840
Let's act like we're close friends.

434
00:21:39,923 --> 00:21:40,966
-Okay.
-Sounds good.

435
00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:44,136
Hey, Joon-bin. Take the picture for us.

436
00:21:44,219 --> 00:21:47,347
-Okay, but I want to be in the next one.
-Fine.

437
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:49,725
But Kian…

438
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:51,643
He took some pretty good pictures of me.

439
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:53,186
All right.

440
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:57,232
Okay, make sure to smile.

441
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:58,275
Kian, smile.

442
00:21:58,358 --> 00:21:59,609
One, two, three.

443
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:03,947
Let's see a big laugh now.
Act like you're happy.

444
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:05,032
Let's laugh.

445
00:22:05,615 --> 00:22:07,534
-Did it turn out okay?
-Let's go.

446
00:22:07,617 --> 00:22:09,077
-How about a selfie?
-No, let's go.

447
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:11,330
THAT'S ENOUGH FOR US

448
00:22:11,413 --> 00:22:12,956
Who cares? It's about the memories.

449
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,500
-I'll take one of you.
-That's a good idea.

450
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:17,210
I'll photoshop you in.

451
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:22,299
-This is good enough.
-Yes.

452
00:22:24,134 --> 00:22:25,260
Goodbye.

453
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:28,138
Bye.

454
00:22:29,973 --> 00:22:31,850
Spread your arms and feel the vibes.

455
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:44,029
I think I'll really miss this place.

456
00:22:45,238 --> 00:22:47,199
-I'm going to miss it.
-Bye, annex.

457
00:22:47,282 --> 00:22:48,867
Bye, annex.

458
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:51,244
-Take care.
-Take care.

459
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:54,081
Take care.

460
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:06,009
-Are you going to East Sea or Pohang?
-I'm going to Hupo Port.

461
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:08,386
SEEING OFF JOON-BIN

462
00:23:08,512 --> 00:23:11,223
I think I'll really miss this place.

463
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:13,683
I got emotional and almost teared up.

464
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:16,144
It's so pretty here.

465
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:19,022
-Why did you get emotional?
-I have moments like that.

466
00:23:19,106 --> 00:23:20,107
-Really?
-Yeah.

467
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:22,067
I even cry when I see strangers cry.

468
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:23,693
"Hey, why are you crying?"

469
00:23:25,862 --> 00:23:26,988
Don't I sound like him?

470
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:29,366
Sure. Totally.

471
00:23:29,449 --> 00:23:31,326
-Was that me?
-"What are you crying for?"

472
00:23:31,409 --> 00:23:34,371
-"What are you doing?"
-"Are you crying?"

473
00:23:34,454 --> 00:23:35,956
"Why are you crying?"

474
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:37,624
Hey, I don't talk like that.

475
00:23:37,707 --> 00:23:39,334
"Seriously, why are you crying?"

476
00:23:39,417 --> 00:23:41,670
BIZARRELY HILARIOUS

477
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:44,297
That's how I show my affection, buddy.

478
00:23:46,341 --> 00:23:47,884
ARRIVED AT THE FERRY TERMINAL

479
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:49,344
-We're here.
-Darn.

480
00:23:49,427 --> 00:23:51,388
-I'm sad to leave.
-Joon-bin.

481
00:23:51,471 --> 00:23:53,473
Have some Dokdo soju on your way back.

482
00:23:53,557 --> 00:23:54,808
PULLS OUT SOJU FROM HIS POCKET

483
00:23:54,891 --> 00:23:55,725
Thanks, Kian.

484
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:57,686
While you're at it, take this trash, too.

485
00:23:58,812 --> 00:24:00,188
This was definitely bizarre.

486
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:02,357
I brought the soju for you, though.

487
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,733
Really? Thank you.

488
00:24:03,817 --> 00:24:06,236
-Anyway, this was fun.
-Thanks for coming.

489
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:08,029
-Goodbye.
-Thanks for everything.

490
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:09,656
-Take care.
-Bye, Joon-bin.

491
00:24:09,739 --> 00:24:10,615
Safe travels.

492
00:24:12,534 --> 00:24:15,328
END OF SHORT-TERM PART-TIME JOB

493
00:24:18,456 --> 00:24:19,708
He's so cute.

494
00:24:21,334 --> 00:24:22,335
Wait, my bag.

495
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:25,172
-His bag?
-Just go.

496
00:24:25,255 --> 00:24:28,383
Hey, hold on.
Open the door. I left my bag.

497
00:24:28,466 --> 00:24:30,927
Hey, stop the car. It's in there.

498
00:24:31,011 --> 00:24:32,512
Thanks for the bag!

499
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:33,555
Keep going.

500
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:37,642
Seriously, I need my bag!
My phone is in there, too!

501
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:43,565
-Where's his bag?
-Where is it?

502
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:44,941
-It's not here.
-His bag?

503
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:46,818
-I don't see it.
-It's not here.

504
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:48,195
I see him running here.

505
00:24:48,278 --> 00:24:50,906
-I honestly don't see it.
-It really isn't here.

506
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:52,407
Hey, it's not here.

507
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:53,658
-Unlock the door.
-Seriously.

508
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:55,452
-It's not here.
-It's not here.

509
00:24:55,535 --> 00:24:57,954
You'll have to ride the monorail again.

510
00:24:58,038 --> 00:24:59,748
-You left it there?
-Where did you hide it?

511
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:01,750
-It really isn't here.
-I bet you left it there.

512
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:03,543
-Check the trunk.
-Open the trunk.

513
00:25:04,127 --> 00:25:06,630
IT WAS IN THE TRUNK

514
00:25:06,713 --> 00:25:08,715
-See you later.
-Are you kidding me?

515
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:09,841
Good luck, guys.

516
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:11,343
-Good luck.
-Take care, Joon-bin.

517
00:25:11,426 --> 00:25:13,011
I wanted to see your faces again.

518
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:20,685
Kian's B&B is the type of place
that travelers dream about.

519
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:23,146
Of all the places I've stayed,
it's got the best vibes.

520
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:24,731
Actually, of all places in the world.

521
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:28,026
It's also the most inefficient place.

522
00:25:28,109 --> 00:25:31,446
I'm sad to leave
since I just started to feel comfortable.

523
00:25:32,155 --> 00:25:33,240
But it was fun.

524
00:25:35,158 --> 00:25:38,745
PART-TIME WORKER OFFICIALLY CLOCKS OUT

525
00:25:38,828 --> 00:25:40,038
Let's head back home.

526
00:25:41,831 --> 00:25:43,250
I didn't say bye to them.

527
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:45,252
CALLING TO SAY GOODBYE
TO THE JOB-SEEKER TEAM

528
00:25:45,335 --> 00:25:47,712
-Hello?
-Hey, it's Kian!

529
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:50,340
I'm calling because I didn't say goodbye.

530
00:25:50,423 --> 00:25:53,426
We wanted to see you before we left.

531
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:55,595
-This is Myeong-gyun.
-Hi, Myeong-gyun.

532
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:58,348
Make sure you get a job
and post it on social media

533
00:25:58,431 --> 00:26:00,100
when this show airs next year.

534
00:26:00,183 --> 00:26:02,936
I promise to erase
"unemployed" from my profile.

535
00:26:03,019 --> 00:26:04,396
Raise someone unemployed?

536
00:26:04,479 --> 00:26:06,439
I'll erase the word
"unemployed" from my profile.

537
00:26:06,523 --> 00:26:07,524
That's the spirit.

538
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:11,403
I'm rooting for you.
I really hope you find a job.

539
00:26:11,486 --> 00:26:13,989
-It was fun, buddy.
-It was fun.

540
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:15,490
Okay, bye now.

541
00:26:15,573 --> 00:26:17,117
-Salute!
-Bye.

542
00:26:19,327 --> 00:26:20,161
Jeodong Coffee?

543
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:23,164
-They sell squid ink ice cream!
-There it is.

544
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:25,709
LET'S GO IN AND EAT

545
00:26:25,792 --> 00:26:27,711
Let's just get the ice cream here.

546
00:26:27,794 --> 00:26:29,087
-Sound good?
-Yes.

547
00:26:29,671 --> 00:26:31,047
-It's really squid ink.
-It is.

548
00:26:31,131 --> 00:26:32,382
-Dig in.
-This looks good.

549
00:26:32,465 --> 00:26:34,551
-Thanks, Boss.
-Enjoy.

550
00:26:34,634 --> 00:26:35,635
This looks good.

551
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,554
Is it different?

552
00:26:37,637 --> 00:26:40,890
We finished cleaning
before leaving the B&B this morning,

553
00:26:40,974 --> 00:26:42,475
so there's nothing left to do.

554
00:26:43,059 --> 00:26:45,437
There wasn't enough time
in the day before.

555
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,439
NOW THE STAFF HAS TIME TO SPARE

556
00:26:47,522 --> 00:26:50,859
We freaked out in the beginning
and had no time to eat.

557
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:52,193
Good times.

558
00:26:55,196 --> 00:26:57,490
-This is so refreshing.
-It really is.

559
00:26:57,574 --> 00:26:59,034
This is our first real break.

560
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:04,331
It feels so weird
to be relaxing like this.

561
00:27:04,414 --> 00:27:05,373
I know, right?

562
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:08,501
I just got used to the B&B,
but it's over now.

563
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:09,711
-Yes.
-You're right.

564
00:27:10,378 --> 00:27:12,464
But…

565
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:14,674
That sounds about right.

566
00:27:14,758 --> 00:27:16,051
Please get a new spoon.

567
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:18,386
Please get a new spoon. Please.

568
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:19,512
It's fine.

569
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:26,353
I said it three times, but he ignored me.

570
00:27:26,436 --> 00:27:29,064
My tongue is faster than your hand.

571
00:27:31,441 --> 00:27:32,984
-Let's get going.
-Okay.

572
00:27:39,074 --> 00:27:40,283
Let's head home.

573
00:27:41,701 --> 00:27:42,744
Let's go.

574
00:27:43,536 --> 00:27:48,083
I've only been gone for a day,
but it looks so bizarre already.

575
00:27:49,417 --> 00:27:50,960
-You can go ahead.
-Okay.

576
00:27:51,044 --> 00:27:52,212
Thank you.

577
00:27:53,588 --> 00:27:55,548
-Should we start cooking?
-Yes.

578
00:27:55,632 --> 00:27:58,259
AS SOON AS THEY GET BACK,
THEY PREPARE DINNER

579
00:27:58,343 --> 00:27:59,761
Do you want to try the purple ones?

580
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:02,222
I was thinking the same thing.
I've never tried it.

581
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:05,141
ATTEMPTING THE TOUGHER HOLDS TODAY

582
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:14,526
Oh, my gosh, he's like a pro.

583
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:19,155
JIN SUCCEEDS

584
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:25,787
THE OWNER ATTEMPTS THE CLIMB

585
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:27,997
My back muscles are stronger now.

586
00:28:28,915 --> 00:28:30,500
There aren't enough to step on.

587
00:28:30,583 --> 00:28:32,168
-Hey, this is hard.
-Right?

588
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:36,256
I can't get up with just the purple ones.

589
00:28:48,518 --> 00:28:52,480
FINISHES UP BY CRAWLING ON ALL FOURS

590
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:57,736
I'm home.

591
00:28:58,486 --> 00:28:59,738
I'm home.

592
00:29:01,865 --> 00:29:03,825
BACK HOME AFTER BEING AWAY FOR 18 HOURS

593
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:07,287
-I forgot to clean the bathrooms.
-I'll do it.

594
00:29:08,788 --> 00:29:11,416
YE-EUN IS IN CHARGE
OF CLEANING THE BATHROOM TODAY

595
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:14,335
STARTS CLEANING

596
00:29:19,132 --> 00:29:22,010
WHILE YE-EUN CLEANS THE BATHROOM

597
00:29:22,093 --> 00:29:24,888
THE OWNER SLIDES DOWN TO MAKE DINNER

598
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:29,017
CLEANLINESS COMES FIRST

599
00:29:31,686 --> 00:29:33,480
This is our last meal here.

600
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:35,398
I'll make the rice and…

601
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:39,819
PREPARING THE LAST DINNER

602
00:29:44,949 --> 00:29:46,326
Eggs and tofu…

603
00:29:47,577 --> 00:29:49,496
How do I make tofu rice?

604
00:29:49,579 --> 00:29:51,456
TOFU RICE?

605
00:29:51,539 --> 00:29:54,209
Since tonight's dinner is our last meal…

606
00:29:54,834 --> 00:29:57,462
I wonder what Chung-il ate in North Korea.

607
00:29:58,546 --> 00:29:59,714
Chung-il?

608
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:02,509
-Yes, how are you?
-It's Kian.

609
00:30:02,592 --> 00:30:04,427
I was just wondering

610
00:30:04,511 --> 00:30:07,472
if you crave a particular dish
from North Korea.

611
00:30:07,555 --> 00:30:09,057
I like tofu rice.

612
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,391
-Tofu rice?
-Yes.

613
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:15,230
-We'll try our best to recreate it.
-Okay.

614
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:16,773
TONIGHT'S MENU IS FOR CHUNG-IL

615
00:30:17,273 --> 00:30:21,361
NORTH KOREAN-STYLE TOFU RICE

616
00:30:21,444 --> 00:30:24,531
We don't have any chives,
so I'll use green onions instead.

617
00:30:24,614 --> 00:30:28,326
LAST DINNER AT KIAN'S B&B
NORTH KOREAN-STYLE TOFU RICE

618
00:30:28,409 --> 00:30:31,204
MAIN INGREDIENT: TOFU

619
00:30:36,209 --> 00:30:38,753
AFTER CUTTING IT INTO TRIANGLES

620
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:41,631
STARTS PAN-FRYING THEM

621
00:30:44,717 --> 00:30:46,636
MAKES THE SAUCE IN THE MEANTIME

622
00:30:46,719 --> 00:30:48,513
One part chili powder.

623
00:30:48,596 --> 00:30:50,014
Two parts soy sauce.

624
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:53,643
ADD GREEN ONIONS

625
00:30:54,894 --> 00:30:57,939
THE TOFU IS FRYING ITSELF

626
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:04,779
LIGHTLY BROWNED

627
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:06,656
QUICKLY FLIPS THEM OVER

628
00:31:07,615 --> 00:31:09,909
KEEPING AN EYE ON THE TOFU

629
00:31:09,993 --> 00:31:12,120
AND STIR-FRYING THE SAUCE AT THE SAME TIME

630
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:15,707
STRUGGLES TO COOK ON HIS OWN

631
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:19,252
MEANWHILE, JIN IS TAKING A BREAK

632
00:31:19,335 --> 00:31:21,880
CLATTER

633
00:31:29,762 --> 00:31:32,348
-Boss?
-Yes?

634
00:31:32,432 --> 00:31:33,892
Do you need any help?

635
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:35,351
Can you fry the tofu?

636
00:31:38,646 --> 00:31:40,023
-Boss.
-Yes?

637
00:31:40,106 --> 00:31:43,151
What if I hadn't come down to help you?

638
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:46,779
You two worked so hard yesterday
that I wanted to give you a break.

639
00:31:46,863 --> 00:31:50,450
You should've asked for help.
You can't do all this by yourself.

640
00:31:51,034 --> 00:31:53,828
THANKS TO JIN, HE CAN FOCUS ON THE SAUCE

641
00:31:58,082 --> 00:32:00,543
TASTE TEST

642
00:32:04,714 --> 00:32:06,007
SATISFIED

643
00:32:08,301 --> 00:32:11,387
THE SAUCE GOES IN A BOWL

644
00:32:14,724 --> 00:32:17,435
This is what North Koreans ate
during the March of Suffering.

645
00:32:17,518 --> 00:32:22,190
There was no other source of protein
because they didn't have meat.

646
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:26,986
This is pretty enough to be served
at an omakase restaurant.

647
00:32:37,914 --> 00:32:39,290
Boss, try a bite.

648
00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:45,964
This tastes interesting.

649
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:53,429
It's not bad.

650
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:55,390
It's good.

651
00:32:58,184 --> 00:33:02,063
HYEONPO PORT AT 6 P.M.

652
00:33:03,189 --> 00:33:05,733
THE NAVY TEAM ARRIVES

653
00:33:06,442 --> 00:33:09,112
CHUNG-IL, YOO-JIN, AND YEO-JIN ARRIVE

654
00:33:10,279 --> 00:33:12,740
-Hello.
-Nice to meet you.

655
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:14,033
Are you in the military?

656
00:33:14,117 --> 00:33:15,284
-Yes.
-Yes, we are.

657
00:33:15,368 --> 00:33:16,411
We're on leave.

658
00:33:16,494 --> 00:33:17,954
-Your hair's short.
-The Navy?

659
00:33:18,037 --> 00:33:19,205
-You're in the Navy?
-Yes.

660
00:33:19,288 --> 00:33:20,415
It's written here.

661
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:23,876
-Where are you based?
-Right here on Ulleungdo Island.

662
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,545
-Really?
-Yes.

663
00:33:25,628 --> 00:33:27,130
We're protecting this island.

664
00:33:27,922 --> 00:33:29,632
-That's cool.
-Did you three come together?

665
00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:30,717
-Us?
-Yes.

666
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,885
-It's our first day together.
-Really?

667
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:34,554
The three of us are in a group.

668
00:33:35,054 --> 00:33:37,640
HE CAME 4 DAYS AGO

669
00:33:37,724 --> 00:33:40,476
THEY CAME 2 DAYS AGO

670
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,853
That's the B&B over there.

671
00:33:41,936 --> 00:33:43,980
-That's the B&B?
-The yellow building.

672
00:33:44,063 --> 00:33:45,231
THE NEW GUESTS KINDLY EXPLAIN

673
00:33:45,314 --> 00:33:48,151
You go down a slide to exit
and climb a wall to go inside.

674
00:33:48,234 --> 00:33:49,652
What? I don't believe you.

675
00:33:49,736 --> 00:33:52,238
-But there is.
-There's a slide.

676
00:33:52,321 --> 00:33:54,407
-Come on.
-I was shocked, too.

677
00:33:54,991 --> 00:33:57,368
Are you messing with us
because you got here first?

678
00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:01,080
LIES SHAMELESSLY

679
00:34:01,789 --> 00:34:03,750
RIGHT THEN, YE-EUN'S BOAT APPROACHES

680
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:05,043
-There she is.
-She's coming.

681
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,170
Is the owner a woman?

682
00:34:07,253 --> 00:34:09,297
SHAMELESS TO THE END

683
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:10,256
She's the captain.

684
00:34:10,339 --> 00:34:12,133
-Yes, the captain.
-But it's a lady.

685
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:13,760
-That's right.
-The captain's a woman.

686
00:34:17,513 --> 00:34:19,098
If we had done that…

687
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:20,224
Ye-eun!

688
00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:22,143
-Ye-eun!
-Hi.

689
00:34:22,643 --> 00:34:24,062
-Wait, what?
-Hello.

690
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:25,646
-Hello.
-"Wait, what?"

691
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:28,191
-We came here before you did.
-Yes, that's right.

692
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:33,738
PROUD

693
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:37,492
-What did you do?
-We took a boat to Jukdo.

694
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:38,576
-Really?
-Yes.

695
00:34:42,371 --> 00:34:44,415
That's great.

696
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:46,918
-Was it easy?
-I'm tired.

697
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:58,096
Wait, are they making the food
that I mentioned?

698
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:01,182
Do you know where he's from?

699
00:35:01,265 --> 00:35:03,309
-Not North America.
-South America, right?

700
00:35:03,392 --> 00:35:06,145
I came from North Korea. I'm a defector.

701
00:35:06,229 --> 00:35:08,022
-Really?
-Are you serious?

702
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:09,357
-For real.
-It's true.

703
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,067
-Seriously?
-So that's why

704
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:14,445
-he wanted North Korean-style tofu rice.
-I see.

705
00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:21,119
Are they really…

706
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:28,042
Are they really making it?

707
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:30,044
Are you touched?

708
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:31,504
-Are you tearing up?
-I just…

709
00:35:31,587 --> 00:35:33,589
I cry a lot these days
because of hormone changes.

710
00:35:33,673 --> 00:35:35,758
I think you're really crying.

711
00:35:35,842 --> 00:35:36,968
Oh, no.

712
00:35:39,095 --> 00:35:41,639
Don't focus on me,
or else I'll really cry.

713
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:45,935
When was the last time you had this?

714
00:35:46,686 --> 00:35:49,147
It's been over 15 years.

715
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:52,733
-What?
-Now I'm about to tear up.

716
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:54,318
I feel sad.

717
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:59,699
When I was around 11 or 12 years old,

718
00:36:00,449 --> 00:36:04,245
my mom bought me this dish
at the market for the last time.

719
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:08,958
After my sister and I crossed the borders,
I didn't really get a chance to have it.

720
00:36:09,041 --> 00:36:11,335
I can't believe they're doing this for me.

721
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:13,462
I don't know what to say.

722
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:19,969
I must be getting old now
because I keep crying.

723
00:36:20,052 --> 00:36:23,514
Me too. It's because we're getting old.

724
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:26,184
We're the only ones here in our thirties.

725
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:28,811
-You get emotional as you age.
-Are you really crying?

726
00:36:28,895 --> 00:36:31,522
I haven't felt this in so long.

727
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:33,983
You must have really missed it.

728
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:39,363
NORTH KOREAN-STYLE TOFU RICE DONE

729
00:36:39,447 --> 00:36:42,241
Is there anything we can make
with the extra rice?

730
00:36:42,325 --> 00:36:45,828
-What can we do with the leftover kimchi?
-Fried rice, of course.

731
00:36:46,996 --> 00:36:50,082
ADDITIONAL MENU ITEM: FRIED RICE

732
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:55,129
ADDS SCRAMBLED EGGS DIRECTLY INTO RICE

733
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:57,673
ADDS KIMCHI AS WELL

734
00:36:59,508 --> 00:37:02,011
BIBIMBAP?

735
00:37:02,094 --> 00:37:04,138
This is a true Kian-style dish.

736
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:09,352
PUTS THE MIXTURE INTO THE FRYING PAN

737
00:37:09,435 --> 00:37:11,520
AND STIR-FRIES IT

738
00:37:11,604 --> 00:37:14,190
Are you cooking all of that rice
in that frying pan?

739
00:37:14,273 --> 00:37:16,108
ABOUT TO SPILL OVER

740
00:37:16,192 --> 00:37:17,109
I'm not sure.

741
00:37:17,193 --> 00:37:19,862
Maybe it's too small.
Let's switch to a pot.

742
00:37:19,946 --> 00:37:21,572
-In this?
-Yes, the pan is too small.

743
00:37:22,281 --> 00:37:26,661
SWITCHES TO THE CAULDRON

744
00:37:34,335 --> 00:37:35,503
Be careful.

745
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:49,433
KIAN-STYLE FRIED RICE IS DONE

746
00:37:50,059 --> 00:37:51,352
JEONG-HUI AND BO-SEUNG RETURN

747
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:53,187
We're back.

748
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:55,022
Everyone, please come and eat.

749
00:37:55,731 --> 00:37:57,275
-Thank you.
-Head on down.

750
00:37:58,651 --> 00:37:59,986
Welcome.

751
00:38:01,487 --> 00:38:04,448
-Are you on leave?
-Yes, we are for three days.

752
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:08,160
-That's great.
-We came to see you.

753
00:38:08,244 --> 00:38:09,954
WELCOME

754
00:38:10,037 --> 00:38:11,747
-Hello.
-Hello.

755
00:38:11,831 --> 00:38:12,873
-We haven't met.
-Right.

756
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:15,167
NICE TO MEET YOU

757
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:18,546
I should wash up
since the guests are here.

758
00:38:19,505 --> 00:38:21,090
I'm a mess right now.

759
00:38:24,051 --> 00:38:28,389
FIXES HIMSELF UP TO GREET THE GUESTS

760
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:29,974
-Hey, everyone.
-Yes?

761
00:38:30,057 --> 00:38:34,478
This is the B&B's last night,
so we wanted to cook you a special meal.

762
00:38:34,562 --> 00:38:36,731
A SPECIAL MEAL?

763
00:38:36,814 --> 00:38:39,525
-It's nothing to clap about.
-It's really nothing.

764
00:38:39,608 --> 00:38:40,901
But to enjoy it more…

765
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:42,111
CURIOUS

766
00:38:42,194 --> 00:38:44,155
KIAN'S WAY OF ENJOYING FOOD

767
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:45,740
EATING WITH BARE HANDS

768
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:47,700
I suggest the new guests try it out.

769
00:38:47,783 --> 00:38:49,869
SHOCKED

770
00:38:49,952 --> 00:38:52,621
If it's a bit much for you,
you can use a spork.

771
00:38:52,705 --> 00:38:54,540
First, wash your hands
thoroughly with soap.

772
00:38:54,623 --> 00:38:57,835
Then, we'll serve ourselves one at a time.

773
00:38:57,918 --> 00:38:59,378
-Okay.
-Got it.

774
00:39:00,046 --> 00:39:03,591
THE OWNER AND THE STAFF
WASH THEIR HANDS, TOO

775
00:39:03,674 --> 00:39:05,593
INTRODUCING THE DINNER MENU

776
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:08,596
This is fried rice, and this is tofu rice
that we made for Chung-il.

777
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:10,681
KIAN-STYLE FRIED RICE
NORTH KOREAN-STYLE TOFU RICE

778
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:12,725
-Thank you for the food.
-Thank you.

779
00:39:12,808 --> 00:39:13,768
LET'S EAT

780
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:15,686
With our hands?

781
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:17,855
SURELY NOT

782
00:39:17,938 --> 00:39:20,441
Do they have any gloves,
like disposable gloves?

783
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:21,817
MIXES IT UP

784
00:39:22,651 --> 00:39:25,321
AND ACTUALLY EATS IT

785
00:39:26,655 --> 00:39:28,574
THEN I'LL TRY IT AS WELL

786
00:39:31,911 --> 00:39:33,871
It's delicious.

787
00:39:35,498 --> 00:39:36,540
HESITATES

788
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:39,335
-It looks great.
-Let's try it.

789
00:39:40,628 --> 00:39:41,754
It looks good.

790
00:39:43,172 --> 00:39:44,673
What is this?

791
00:39:45,674 --> 00:39:48,594
BO-SEUNG EATS WITH HIS HANDS, TOO

792
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:51,764
NOTICES SOMETHING

793
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:59,772
NIBBLES

794
00:40:00,856 --> 00:40:03,567
If you can't do it, I'll give you a spoon.

795
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:05,444
No, it's because it's hot.

796
00:40:05,528 --> 00:40:07,238
Stop it. It cooled down a while ago.

797
00:40:07,321 --> 00:40:10,533
-No, it's really hot.
-I guess you can't do it.

798
00:40:10,616 --> 00:40:12,660
When he asked me if I wanted a spoon,

799
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:15,037
it hurt my pride,
so I ate it all with my hand.

800
00:40:16,956 --> 00:40:20,209
-The fried rice is really good.
-It's delicious.

801
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:23,254
YE-EUN TAKES A BITE OF TOFU RICE

802
00:40:23,337 --> 00:40:24,839
This is good!

803
00:40:24,922 --> 00:40:26,465
It's super good.

804
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:30,845
THE TOFU RICE IS DELICIOUS

805
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:34,306
CHUNG-IL TAKES A PICTURE FIRST

806
00:40:35,015 --> 00:40:38,686
THEN IMMEDIATELY TAKES A BITE

807
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:43,065
Chung-il, give me your honest opinion.

808
00:40:43,149 --> 00:40:45,151
It tastes almost the same.

809
00:40:45,234 --> 00:40:47,486
-Really?
-Thank you so much.

810
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:49,780
It tastes almost exactly
the same as back then.

811
00:40:50,698 --> 00:40:51,991
I didn't think it would…

812
00:40:52,074 --> 00:40:54,785
The sauce is almost identical.

813
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:58,080
-I didn't think you could recreate this.
-Thank you.

814
00:40:58,164 --> 00:41:01,917
Apparently, they eat this
only on special days in North Korea.

815
00:41:02,001 --> 00:41:03,878
It's really delicious.

816
00:41:03,961 --> 00:41:06,255
It's special to me.

817
00:41:06,338 --> 00:41:08,549
I grew up very poor back in my hometown,

818
00:41:08,632 --> 00:41:10,342
and since it was just me and my sister,

819
00:41:10,426 --> 00:41:12,344
I almost never got to eat
whatever I wanted.

820
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:15,055
It's been just the two of us
since I was 12.

821
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:16,974
I'm the only one who knows the real taste,

822
00:41:17,057 --> 00:41:19,393
but I'm so happy
that we're all experiencing it.

823
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:21,812
-Kian, I'm so grateful.
-You're welcome.

824
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:23,272
Jin, thank you.

825
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:24,982
Thank you so much.

826
00:41:25,065 --> 00:41:27,985
-Do you want this one?
-There's one more left.

827
00:41:28,068 --> 00:41:29,820
-Is that okay?
-Go ahead.

828
00:41:29,904 --> 00:41:31,530
This meal was for you.

829
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:35,284
-Is it good?
-It's really delicious.

830
00:41:35,993 --> 00:41:37,912
It feels like my birthday today.

831
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:40,498
I'm serious.

832
00:41:41,081 --> 00:41:43,167
-I'm so full.
-This was nice.

833
00:41:46,462 --> 00:41:49,340
AFTER DINNER, THE OWNER GOES UPSTAIRS

834
00:41:54,053 --> 00:41:55,304
Everyone, come upstairs!

835
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:01,852
-Jeez.
-Did it hit you?

836
00:42:01,936 --> 00:42:03,938
JIN'S POLE CLIMBING ROUTINE:
REMOVE SOCKS AND ROLL UP PANTS

837
00:42:07,566 --> 00:42:09,360
-Jeez.
-Did it hit you?

838
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:11,612
-Jeez.
-Did it hit you?

839
00:42:12,279 --> 00:42:13,447
How did it land right there?

840
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:15,658
I'm only holding back
because you're a BTS member.

841
00:42:15,741 --> 00:42:16,992
You shouldn't have been there.

842
00:42:17,076 --> 00:42:19,078
If you weren't such a global star…

843
00:42:25,834 --> 00:42:28,295
Hey, I think you got stronger.

844
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:31,090
Holy cow, how does he do that?
I want to try like that.

845
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:35,427
YOO-JIN ATTEMPTS IT

846
00:42:35,511 --> 00:42:36,720
Keep going.

847
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:38,138
Pull your body up.

848
00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:41,892
I think you got this, Yoo-jin.
Just a little more.

849
00:42:41,976 --> 00:42:44,311
-What the heck?
-What in the world?

850
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:46,522
Pull harder. There you go.

851
00:42:47,106 --> 00:42:48,732
This is insane, Yoo-jin.

852
00:42:49,858 --> 00:42:51,277
Put your foot up.

853
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,820
SUCCESSFULLY CLIMBS THE POLE

854
00:42:52,903 --> 00:42:55,614
You actually did it!

855
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:59,201
-I'm so proud of myself.
-You did it.

856
00:42:59,285 --> 00:43:00,494
Is everyone upstairs now?

857
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:02,371
All right, everyone!

858
00:43:02,913 --> 00:43:04,832
Let's get going.

859
00:43:04,915 --> 00:43:06,458
Be careful.

860
00:43:06,542 --> 00:43:08,711
-Where are we going?
-Are we having a party?

861
00:43:08,794 --> 00:43:12,214
THE OWNER INVITES EVERYONE OUTSIDE
ON THE LAST NIGHT

862
00:43:12,298 --> 00:43:13,757
What are we doing?

863
00:43:14,383 --> 00:43:18,220
Everyone, the show will begin
in the ocean over there.

864
00:43:18,304 --> 00:43:20,014
A SHOW?

865
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:22,725
THERE'S A SHOW?

866
00:43:22,808 --> 00:43:25,102
Let's stand over here and face the ocean.

867
00:43:25,185 --> 00:43:27,980
GUIDES THEM TO THE BEST SPOT
TO VIEW THE SHOW

868
00:43:28,063 --> 00:43:30,691
LINED UP AS IF THEY'RE
IN AN AWARD CEREMONY

869
00:43:30,774 --> 00:43:33,527
Tonight is the B&B's last night.

870
00:43:34,069 --> 00:43:35,404
So this is the last show.

871
00:43:35,487 --> 00:43:36,322
This was very…

872
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:41,285
I prepared all of this for you.
You're very lucky.

873
00:43:42,077 --> 00:43:44,747
MAKING HIS WAY TO THE HOST'S POSITION

874
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:45,914
Only you get to see this.

875
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:50,210
But you have to show
that you really want it.

876
00:43:50,294 --> 00:43:53,255
So, shout out your wish toward the sky.

877
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:55,924
YOU MUST SAY YOUR WISH OUT LOUD
TO SEE THIS SHOW

878
00:43:56,008 --> 00:43:59,678
The god of Ulleungdo Island
might hear you and respond.

879
00:43:59,762 --> 00:44:01,221
What should I wish for?

880
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:03,098
-Ye-eun, why don't you go first?
-Okay.

881
00:44:03,182 --> 00:44:05,017
I want to be happy!

882
00:44:07,978 --> 00:44:11,482
I want to live life
doing the things I love!

883
00:44:14,276 --> 00:44:17,321
I want my loved ones to live happily!

884
00:44:17,404 --> 00:44:21,784
Jeong-hui!
Don't live by other people's standards!

885
00:44:21,867 --> 00:44:26,497
Live by your own standards and be happy!

886
00:44:29,124 --> 00:44:31,251
I want a girlfriend!

887
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:32,670
That's good.

888
00:44:33,754 --> 00:44:35,297
I just want to get discharged!

889
00:44:39,009 --> 00:44:41,970
ARMY, be happy!

890
00:44:43,889 --> 00:44:45,557
A FOOL FOR ARMY

891
00:44:45,641 --> 00:44:47,101
All right, now your wishes…

892
00:44:47,184 --> 00:44:48,769
Wait, it feels too old-school.

893
00:44:48,852 --> 00:44:51,480
OLD-SCHOOL STYLE SHOW HOST

894
00:44:51,563 --> 00:44:54,024
I'm old, so I can't help it.

895
00:45:03,617 --> 00:45:05,744
-What's that?
-Is there a surprise?

896
00:45:07,037 --> 00:45:08,330
RESOLUTE

897
00:45:08,414 --> 00:45:09,623
Is this for real?

898
00:45:10,249 --> 00:45:12,501
-Boss, what about your wish?
-You need to say it.

899
00:45:12,584 --> 00:45:14,503
Dear guests, I love you all!

900
00:45:18,841 --> 00:45:20,551
Now, let's find out

901
00:45:21,051 --> 00:45:24,721
if the god of Ulleungdo Island heard
your wishes and will give an answer.

902
00:45:24,805 --> 00:45:27,891
-Yes!
-Yes!

903
00:45:29,643 --> 00:45:31,478
-What's this?
-What's going on?

904
00:45:32,062 --> 00:45:33,355
What is it?

905
00:45:33,439 --> 00:45:34,606
What's that?

906
00:45:36,817 --> 00:45:37,693
-What?
-What is it?

907
00:45:40,237 --> 00:45:41,280
What is it?

908
00:45:41,363 --> 00:45:43,657
The god of Ulleungdo Island is responding!

909
00:45:56,753 --> 00:45:58,088
This is incredible!

910
00:46:02,009 --> 00:46:04,219
I can't believe
we're seeing this from here!

911
00:46:08,515 --> 00:46:10,601
This is great.

912
00:46:10,684 --> 00:46:13,395
The god of Ulleungdo Island
provide us with answers!

913
00:46:22,154 --> 00:46:26,533
The god of Ulleungdo Island
is granting your wishes.

914
00:46:28,994 --> 00:46:32,247
The god of Ulleungdo Island is responding!

915
00:46:32,331 --> 00:46:34,124
-This is amazing.
-This is so cool.

916
00:46:35,375 --> 00:46:38,003
This is great!

917
00:46:38,086 --> 00:46:39,213
The god of Ulleungdo Island.

918
00:46:44,134 --> 00:46:48,222
I wanted to keep the spire tower a secret
and then surprise everyone.

919
00:46:49,806 --> 00:46:51,350
I want it to explode at night…

920
00:46:51,433 --> 00:46:52,976
FIRST DAY, ROCKET, FIREWORKS SHOW?

921
00:46:53,852 --> 00:46:55,145
…and launch into the sky.

922
00:47:01,527 --> 00:47:02,694
This is great!

923
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:07,491
I've never seen fireworks so up close.

924
00:47:08,325 --> 00:47:09,826
It was absolutely beautiful.

925
00:47:10,536 --> 00:47:14,540
It was so pretty that I felt overwhelmed.
I was moved.

926
00:47:15,457 --> 00:47:18,252
He made sure
the grand finale was spectacular.

927
00:47:19,419 --> 00:47:24,550
Watching the fireworks gave me hope
that my wish would come true.

928
00:47:24,633 --> 00:47:26,677
That made me feel good.

929
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:31,640
Thank you, god of Ulleungdo Island.

930
00:47:35,602 --> 00:47:37,020
-Amazing!
-This is fantastic!

931
00:47:39,523 --> 00:47:41,233
This is incredible!

932
00:47:52,244 --> 00:47:53,328
I love it!

933
00:47:56,248 --> 00:47:57,374
I love it!

934
00:48:01,587 --> 00:48:02,921
That was insane.

935
00:48:03,005 --> 00:48:05,549
That was totally insane.

936
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:09,094
That was incredible.

937
00:48:10,679 --> 00:48:12,347
Everyone, the god has responded!

938
00:48:12,848 --> 00:48:14,099
That was the best!

939
00:48:16,643 --> 00:48:17,686
This is great!

940
00:48:17,769 --> 00:48:20,731
-I think I'll get discharged this year.
-I'm so moved.

941
00:48:23,358 --> 00:48:25,110
Everybody loved it.

942
00:48:25,193 --> 00:48:27,237
It was the most satisfying moment for me.

943
00:48:27,321 --> 00:48:30,741
I wanted them to know
there was a reason for these towers.

944
00:48:30,824 --> 00:48:33,785
I wanted to show them the hidden reason.

945
00:48:34,661 --> 00:48:36,705
So when the spire opened…

946
00:48:38,624 --> 00:48:41,293
My heart swelled with pride.

947
00:48:45,964 --> 00:48:47,841
-Don't laugh too much.
-Can you do it again?

948
00:48:47,924 --> 00:48:49,009
Do I have to?

949
00:48:50,302 --> 00:48:51,261
I can't get over it.

950
00:48:51,345 --> 00:48:53,805
It was so pretty,
especially seeing it up close.

951
00:48:53,889 --> 00:48:55,557
How did he install it up there?

952
00:48:55,641 --> 00:48:58,018
Let's go upstairs and have a talent show.

953
00:48:59,227 --> 00:49:02,773
-What do you want to sing?
-I'm singing that ballad.

954
00:49:02,856 --> 00:49:05,025
-Go, Kian!
-You got this!

955
00:49:07,319 --> 00:49:10,364
THE OWNER SHOWS OFF HIS SINGING SKILLS

956
00:49:10,447 --> 00:49:14,159
-When you fall in love
-When you fall in love

957
00:49:14,242 --> 00:49:17,579
ASTONISHED

958
00:49:17,663 --> 00:49:20,957
-…how beautiful you are
-He's really good!

959
00:49:21,041 --> 00:49:22,250
Yes, he is.

960
00:49:23,251 --> 00:49:27,130
SINGS HIS HEART OUT

961
00:49:29,174 --> 00:49:32,260
It makes it harder when I hear about you

962
00:49:32,344 --> 00:49:35,430
Do you like him?

963
00:49:35,514 --> 00:49:39,601
-To be honest, I can't stand it
-To be honest, I can't stand it

964
00:49:40,227 --> 00:49:45,607
I wish you were a little less happy

965
00:49:45,691 --> 00:49:47,943
Just a little bit

966
00:49:48,026 --> 00:49:51,947
-Even if it's only a tenth of my pain
-Even if it's only a tenth of my pain

967
00:49:52,030 --> 00:49:55,492
-It hurts
-It hurts

968
00:49:56,535 --> 00:49:58,036
Nice job!

969
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:01,665
Be happy

970
00:50:02,874 --> 00:50:04,543
-Thank you.
-Yes, Boss!

971
00:50:04,626 --> 00:50:08,922
It's been an honor to meet all of you.

972
00:50:09,005 --> 00:50:12,092
-No, the honor is mine.
-The honor is ours!

973
00:50:12,175 --> 00:50:16,221
To everyone who came to Kian's B&B,
I wish all of you happiness!

974
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:20,851
Promise me you'll be happy!

975
00:50:22,436 --> 00:50:27,941
THE LAST NIGHT COMES TO AN END

976
00:50:34,614 --> 00:50:38,660
KIAN B&B CLOSES TODAY

977
00:50:38,744 --> 00:50:41,163
3 HOURS UNTIL KIAN'S B&B CLOSES

978
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:49,504
I feel sad.

979
00:50:50,505 --> 00:50:51,757
Did you sleep okay?

980
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:53,842
-Yes, good morning.
-Good morning.

981
00:50:53,925 --> 00:50:55,761
-Did you sleep well?
-It got too cold.

982
00:50:55,844 --> 00:50:57,512
-It was really cold at dawn.
-Right?

983
00:50:57,596 --> 00:50:59,848
-The sleeping bag helped.
-It did help.

984
00:51:00,432 --> 00:51:01,516
I'm so sad.

985
00:51:03,143 --> 00:51:04,978
-Wasn't it cold last night?
-It was freezing.

986
00:51:05,896 --> 00:51:08,398
I went downstairs
and turned off the air conditioner.

987
00:51:10,317 --> 00:51:13,236
4 A.M.

988
00:51:17,032 --> 00:51:19,326
ARE THEY SLEEPING OKAY?

989
00:51:19,409 --> 00:51:23,038
KIAN NOW ACTS LIKE A TRUE B&B OWNER

990
00:51:24,581 --> 00:51:27,876
YE-EUN IS PACKING

991
00:51:28,710 --> 00:51:29,878
I feel sad.

992
00:51:32,088 --> 00:51:32,964
Good morning.

993
00:51:33,048 --> 00:51:35,717
JIN'S GOES TO WORK FOR THE LAST TIME

994
00:51:42,557 --> 00:51:44,434
What a shame.

995
00:51:44,518 --> 00:51:46,853
TAKING IN EVERYTHING FOR THE LAST TIME

996
00:51:50,357 --> 00:51:52,818
Everyone, don't forget
to write in the guest book.

997
00:51:54,653 --> 00:51:56,780
Writing this makes me sad.
I don't want to leave.

998
00:51:56,863 --> 00:51:58,323
It feels like the end.

999
00:51:59,741 --> 00:52:02,661
YOO-JIN AND YEO-JIN
THE BEST DIET WE'VE EVER TRIED

1000
00:52:06,915 --> 00:52:09,835
NORTH AND SOUTH PARK CHUNG-IL WAS HERE
I'LL NEVER FORGET THIS PLACE

1001
00:52:09,918 --> 00:52:11,920
I COULD NEVER FORGET THIS PLACE
KIM HYEON-BEEN

1002
00:52:12,003 --> 00:52:14,339
IT WAS SHORT BUT SWEET
THANK YOU, JI-WUNG

1003
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:18,969
-Will this building get torn down?
-I'm thinking about what to do.

1004
00:52:19,052 --> 00:52:20,220
-It'll be a shame.
-Right?

1005
00:52:20,303 --> 00:52:21,263
-Totally.
-I agree.

1006
00:52:21,346 --> 00:52:22,806
Let's move it to your house.

1007
00:52:22,889 --> 00:52:25,350
This whole thing?

1008
00:52:25,851 --> 00:52:28,603
Or you can live here.
You're rich, so you can do it.

1009
00:52:28,687 --> 00:52:29,896
He's right.

1010
00:52:30,856 --> 00:52:32,691
Barges are probably expensive.

1011
00:52:32,774 --> 00:52:35,235
Everyone, let's get ready to check out.

1012
00:52:35,318 --> 00:52:36,486
-Okay.
-Okay.

1013
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:38,363
It does feel strange, though.

1014
00:52:38,446 --> 00:52:41,199
-Saying goodbye after the past few days…
-I know.

1015
00:52:41,283 --> 00:52:43,577
-It does feel weird.
-I've gotten close with everyone.

1016
00:52:45,078 --> 00:52:47,497
WATCHING THE GUESTS LEAVE ONE LAST TIME

1017
00:52:50,041 --> 00:52:52,294
-Jin, it was nice to meet you.
-It's been fun, buddy.

1018
00:52:57,924 --> 00:53:00,135
-I'm sad.
-I'm so bummed.

1019
00:53:00,802 --> 00:53:02,053
Goodbye.

1020
00:53:02,137 --> 00:53:03,763
-It's been fun!
-Bye!

1021
00:53:03,847 --> 00:53:05,181
Good luck!

1022
00:53:05,765 --> 00:53:06,850
Take care.

1023
00:53:06,933 --> 00:53:08,435
-Thanks for everything.
-Thank you.

1024
00:53:08,518 --> 00:53:10,145
Kian, we love you!

1025
00:53:10,228 --> 00:53:11,938
Go BTS!

1026
00:53:12,022 --> 00:53:13,064
Good luck!

1027
00:53:13,732 --> 00:53:15,317
Take care, everyone!

1028
00:53:18,945 --> 00:53:21,114
-This is it.
-I'm so sad.

1029
00:53:21,197 --> 00:53:23,116
My first thought was, "What the hell?"

1030
00:53:23,241 --> 00:53:26,077
Ye-eun, I honestly thought
it was just a barge.

1031
00:53:26,161 --> 00:53:28,371
-I can't believe we slept there.
-Seriously.

1032
00:53:31,958 --> 00:53:34,502
Kian's B&B is all about the vibes.

1033
00:53:34,586 --> 00:53:38,173
I felt very emotional as we were leaving.

1034
00:53:40,717 --> 00:53:43,011
Kian's B&B gave me
an unforgettable memory.

1035
00:53:45,138 --> 00:53:47,223
It felt like a dream.

1036
00:53:47,307 --> 00:53:49,184
Kian's B&B is
where my dream was fulfilled.

1037
00:53:51,186 --> 00:53:54,648
-I don't want to leave.
-It's such a shame.

1038
00:53:54,731 --> 00:53:56,316
-Thank you.
-Thanks so much.

1039
00:53:56,399 --> 00:53:57,692
Thanks for everything.

1040
00:53:58,401 --> 00:54:00,403
-Bye, Ye-eun.
-Goodbye.

1041
00:54:00,487 --> 00:54:02,530
-Take care.
-Bye.

1042
00:54:03,657 --> 00:54:04,824
This feels weird.

1043
00:54:07,327 --> 00:54:09,746
-She's crying.
-Ye-eun!

1044
00:54:11,539 --> 00:54:13,166
-She's crying.
-Don't cry.

1045
00:54:13,249 --> 00:54:16,044
Say hi when you see me. Bye.

1046
00:54:17,545 --> 00:54:18,672
-Ye-eun.
-Oh, dear.

1047
00:54:18,755 --> 00:54:20,799
She's crying.

1048
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:33,561
-Don't cry.
-Just leave.

1049
00:54:34,396 --> 00:54:35,605
Don't go. Just leave.

1050
00:54:35,689 --> 00:54:37,691
-Don't go.
-She's really crying.

1051
00:54:37,774 --> 00:54:39,150
Thank you for everything!

1052
00:54:40,026 --> 00:54:43,905
I'll remember the last guests
for a long time.

1053
00:54:44,656 --> 00:54:45,991
YEO-JIN AND YOO-JIN

1054
00:54:46,074 --> 00:54:47,617
CHUNG-IL

1055
00:54:47,701 --> 00:54:48,827
JEONG-HUI AND BO-SEUNG

1056
00:54:48,910 --> 00:54:50,495
JEONG-HYEON, HYEON-BEEN, JI-WUNG,
JIN-PYO, JAE-HYEOK

1057
00:54:51,329 --> 00:54:54,249
ALL GUESTS HAVE CHECKED OUT

1058
00:54:54,332 --> 00:54:57,711
Let's clean and tidy up a bit.
Then we'll be done.

1059
00:54:58,253 --> 00:55:01,631
LAST TIME CLEANING UP AT KIAN'S B&B

1060
00:55:06,386 --> 00:55:08,847
LAST TIME DOING DISHES

1061
00:55:11,725 --> 00:55:14,019
LAST TIME WASHING HIS FACE HERE

1062
00:55:17,814 --> 00:55:21,484
LAST TIME FIXING UP HIMSELF

1063
00:55:22,986 --> 00:55:25,405
MEANWHILE, ON THE SECOND FLOOR

1064
00:55:25,488 --> 00:55:27,574
We're going on a break

1065
00:55:28,116 --> 00:55:29,826
and leaving Kian's B&B vacant.

1066
00:55:29,909 --> 00:55:31,995
So, do we really need
to wipe the floor here?

1067
00:55:32,078 --> 00:55:33,955
-Not at all.
-Right?

1068
00:55:34,039 --> 00:55:36,166
GREAT MINDS THINK ALIKE

1069
00:55:36,249 --> 00:55:38,334
-Hey, guys. Take this.
-What?

1070
00:55:38,418 --> 00:55:40,378
LAST DELIVERY UP THE POLE

1071
00:55:40,462 --> 00:55:41,588
Just leave it there.

1072
00:55:44,257 --> 00:55:46,551
It'll be a huge waste
to leave this all behind.

1073
00:55:48,928 --> 00:55:50,889
Jin, take this, too.

1074
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:53,725
Take this up.

1075
00:55:53,808 --> 00:55:55,560
-But how?
-Grab it.

1076
00:55:55,643 --> 00:55:56,644
My pants are…

1077
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:02,233
BIZARRE DISASTER

1078
00:56:02,317 --> 00:56:05,278
He let go because you grabbed the basket!

1079
00:56:05,361 --> 00:56:07,697
My pants don't stretch,
so I couldn't bend over.

1080
00:56:07,781 --> 00:56:12,035
BICKERING

1081
00:56:14,788 --> 00:56:16,164
Sorry, Boss.

1082
00:56:17,332 --> 00:56:18,374
Are you laughing?

1083
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,502
-I'm sorry.
-How dare you?

1084
00:56:20,585 --> 00:56:22,087
I didn't even touch it.

1085
00:56:22,170 --> 00:56:25,381
Come on. I was just trying to help.

1086
00:56:25,465 --> 00:56:28,259
-Good job. You did nothing wrong.
-Seriously.

1087
00:56:28,343 --> 00:56:31,096
-I was just trying to help--
-I said you didn't do anything wrong!

1088
00:56:31,179 --> 00:56:32,388
Why are you yelling at me?

1089
00:56:32,472 --> 00:56:36,184
FIGHTING AGAIN

1090
00:56:36,976 --> 00:56:38,394
Quit fighting and grab this.

1091
00:56:39,437 --> 00:56:40,647
Hey.

1092
00:56:40,730 --> 00:56:42,982
-Get it right this time!
-I got it.

1093
00:56:43,066 --> 00:56:44,692
One, two, three.

1094
00:56:46,444 --> 00:56:48,655
-What are you doing?
-Hurry up!

1095
00:56:48,738 --> 00:56:51,741
-What are you doing? Lift up that side.
-Hold on.

1096
00:56:51,825 --> 00:56:54,494
-You're blocking his--
-My hand is stuck.

1097
00:56:56,037 --> 00:56:57,539
I said my hand's stuck!

1098
00:57:02,252 --> 00:57:04,963
Kian defines youth.

1099
00:57:05,046 --> 00:57:07,048
Youth doesn't define Kian.

1100
00:57:07,132 --> 00:57:10,677
I think Kian's behavior defines youth.

1101
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:14,139
He only comes up
with absolutely ridiculous ideas.

1102
00:57:14,222 --> 00:57:17,517
When else would I come
to a ridiculous place like this?

1103
00:57:18,059 --> 00:57:22,063
I said Kian defines youth,
but he also defines idealism.

1104
00:57:22,147 --> 00:57:25,275
I'm leaving here
with some of that idealism.

1105
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:28,903
Ideals are made up
of dreams and imagination.

1106
00:57:28,987 --> 00:57:30,196
Just like this house.

1107
00:57:31,656 --> 00:57:32,991
Idealism?

1108
00:57:33,491 --> 00:57:35,452
It's just one page
out of the book of youth.

1109
00:57:36,578 --> 00:57:37,704
Period.

1110
00:57:40,248 --> 00:57:43,042
This place is where
my imagination became a reality.

1111
00:57:43,918 --> 00:57:46,796
It'll feel strange when I go home
and think back on it.

1112
00:57:47,297 --> 00:57:52,051
A place where imagination
became a reality.

1113
00:57:53,344 --> 00:57:55,096
This place feels like a dream.

1114
00:57:55,597 --> 00:57:57,056
It's so unreal.

1115
00:57:57,849 --> 00:58:01,311
We look forward
to your reactions to this show!

1116
00:58:01,394 --> 00:58:03,605
We hope to see you again
for a second season!

1117
00:58:05,732 --> 00:58:08,067
-Just say, "See you again."
-Don't say the whole thing!

1118
00:58:08,151 --> 00:58:11,321
-We say the next part!
-Is that right? Got it.

1119
00:58:11,404 --> 00:58:15,241
Everyone, then we shall meet again
in season two!

1120
00:58:16,242 --> 00:58:18,578
-Just say, "See you again"!
-"See you again"!

1121
00:58:18,661 --> 00:58:20,079
-Oh, just that part?
-Yes!

1122
00:58:20,163 --> 00:58:22,081
-Seriously.
-I can't do this. You do it.

1123
00:58:22,165 --> 00:58:24,209
-We have to do it together.
-This is Kian's B&B!

1124
00:58:24,292 --> 00:58:25,293
I'll start over.

1125
00:58:25,376 --> 00:58:28,254
Everyone, see you again…

1126
00:58:28,338 --> 00:58:30,507
-In season two!
-In season two!

1127
00:58:30,590 --> 00:58:33,218
KIAN'S B&B

1128
00:58:36,137 --> 00:58:38,515
-Oh, just the beginning part?
-Exactly.

1129
00:58:38,598 --> 00:58:40,975
PLEASE

1130
00:58:41,059 --> 00:58:43,019
And we repeat the last part together?

1131
00:58:43,102 --> 00:58:45,188
This is why Jin gets annoyed
and takes off.

1132
00:58:45,271 --> 00:58:46,105
Give me a break.

1133
00:58:46,773 --> 00:58:48,816
He'll get mad and leave.

1134
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:50,276
Let's go get some mulhoe.

1135
00:58:51,569 --> 00:58:55,740
KIAN'S BIZARRE B&B

1136
00:59:51,796 --> 00:59:53,715
