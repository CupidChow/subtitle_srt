1
00:00:07,257 --> 00:00:09,050
We have to hurry and go get the luggage.

2
00:00:09,134 --> 00:00:10,969
The guests will be coming back soon.

3
00:00:11,052 --> 00:00:14,431
We'll lift you up slowly,
so you just do this.

4
00:00:14,514 --> 00:00:16,641
I don't have any strength on my hands.

5
00:00:16,725 --> 00:00:18,518
-Don't give up. Focus.
-Yeah, you can do it.

6
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:21,479
Ye-eun, focus.

7
00:00:21,563 --> 00:00:22,856
Ye-eun, you can do it.

8
00:00:23,732 --> 00:00:25,275
-Repeat after me. "I can."
-"I can."

9
00:00:25,358 --> 00:00:26,192
"I can do it."

10
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:27,193
-"I can do it."
-Focus.

11
00:00:27,277 --> 00:00:28,236
Focus.

12
00:00:28,319 --> 00:00:29,738
Use your strength to grab it.

13
00:00:29,821 --> 00:00:31,197
-That's it. Yes.
-On rhythm, okay?

14
00:00:31,281 --> 00:00:32,490
-Believe.
-That's right.

15
00:00:32,574 --> 00:00:34,075
-Don't give up.
-I'm going insane.

16
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:35,493
-Don't give up.
-Okay.

17
00:00:35,577 --> 00:00:36,536
I can do this.

18
00:00:36,619 --> 00:00:38,830
One foot at a time.
Lift one foot at a time.

19
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:44,169
-There you go.
-My goodness!

20
00:00:44,252 --> 00:00:46,421
-There you go. Don't bend your legs!
-That's it.

21
00:00:46,504 --> 00:00:47,922
Don't bend your legs.

22
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:49,716
Hey! Don't bend your legs.

23
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:50,675
Keep them straight!

24
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:51,926
STRETCHES OUT

25
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:52,927
Not like that!

26
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:54,262
-Grab it and go up.
-Hey, go up!

27
00:00:54,345 --> 00:00:55,847
-Go up. Okay.
-Go up. There you go!

28
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:56,765
-Good job!
-Yes!

29
00:00:56,848 --> 00:00:58,683
-Go up!
-Now, your feet…

30
00:00:59,434 --> 00:01:01,603
-Get up there!
-Pull your legs back.

31
00:01:01,686 --> 00:01:03,021
-Put your legs on that!
-Up. Hey!

32
00:01:03,104 --> 00:01:04,314
-Let go.
-There.

33
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:05,982
-She got it.
-You are strong.

34
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:07,067
Yeah, you're doing well.

35
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:07,984
She got it.

36
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:10,862
See? You can do it.

37
00:01:10,945 --> 00:01:12,322
Incredible.

38
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:14,574
Can you get up there already?

39
00:01:14,657 --> 00:01:15,950
Wait, hold on.

40
00:01:16,034 --> 00:01:17,952
I can't go up. Hold on.

41
00:01:18,036 --> 00:01:20,080
-Use your legs.
-Push the pole with your legs.

42
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:21,372
-Yeah.
-Push it with your legs.

43
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:22,582
-That's it.
-Use your legs.

44
00:01:22,665 --> 00:01:24,834
-There you go.
-There we go. Jesus Christ.

45
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:25,835
Jesus Christ.

46
00:01:26,544 --> 00:01:28,004
Seriously!

47
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:29,589
Do we have to do it like this?

48
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:33,134
THE OWNER'S TURN NOW

49
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:42,310
Good job.

50
00:01:42,393 --> 00:01:44,604
WHILE THEY STRUGGLE WITH THE POLE

51
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:48,942
A NEW GUEST ARRIVES ON ULLEUNGDO ISLAND

52
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:54,405
Look at the color of the ocean.

53
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:56,574
That's insane.

54
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:01,621
Hello?

55
00:02:01,704 --> 00:02:03,206
-Hello?
-Yes?

56
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:05,750
I'm Lee Ah-jin. I'm checking in today.

57
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:06,793
Right, hello.

58
00:02:06,876 --> 00:02:08,002
How many are with you?

59
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:10,213
-It's just me.
-Just you?

60
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:12,674
You need to come to Hyeonpo Port.

61
00:02:12,757 --> 00:02:15,969
Could you check your GPS
and tell me how long it will take?

62
00:02:16,052 --> 00:02:17,428
Okay.

63
00:02:17,512 --> 00:02:20,557
ANOTHER GROUP OF NEW GUESTS

64
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,558
RENTAL CAR AREA

65
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:22,684
It must be that car.

66
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:24,978
HANDS FULL OF LUGGAGE

67
00:02:25,061 --> 00:02:26,229
Will mine fit in there?

68
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:27,438
Can we put it in like this?

69
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:31,359
-Hello?
-Hello?

70
00:02:31,442 --> 00:02:32,318
Hello.

71
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:34,779
We're supposed to be checking in today.

72
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:36,156
How many of you are coming?

73
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,240
Three people.

74
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:38,199
Three people.

75
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:39,284
Three?

76
00:02:41,077 --> 00:02:42,912
NINE PEOPLE?

77
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:43,872
WE'RE IN TROUBLE

78
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:45,957
Okay. Are you coming now to check in?

79
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,543
No, we might explore a bit first.

80
00:02:48,626 --> 00:02:50,628
Then, we'll text you the address.

81
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:52,714
Okay. We'll see you soon.

82
00:02:52,797 --> 00:02:53,882
Okay, thank you.

83
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:54,799
Bye.

84
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:56,968
More guests are arriving in two hours!

85
00:02:57,051 --> 00:02:58,011
In two hours?

86
00:02:58,094 --> 00:02:59,053
In two hours!

87
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:00,805
Jin says guests are coming in two hours!

88
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:01,723
Come down!

89
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:20,450
Then, how many are there in total today?

90
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:22,076
We originally had five.

91
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,411
-It's nine.
-Then, four more.

92
00:03:23,494 --> 00:03:26,456
One, two, three, four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven.

93
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:28,082
We're one bed short.

94
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:29,125
-We're short?
-Yeah.

95
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:32,170
I think Ye-eun might be better off
sleeping in a tent.

96
00:03:32,253 --> 00:03:33,630
-On the ground?
-Yeah.

97
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:35,214
So we're…

98
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:37,175
-We're one bed short.
-Okay.

99
00:03:37,258 --> 00:03:38,509
Want to sleep in a tent?

100
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:40,053
-We'll set one up down here.
-Okay.

101
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:41,304
It'd be in the corner there.

102
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:43,056
I would love that.

103
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:44,432
Thank you. I'll work hard.

104
00:03:44,515 --> 00:03:45,350
WHAT LUCK

105
00:03:45,433 --> 00:03:46,517
Let's go!

106
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:48,603
We need to go fetch everyone's luggage.

107
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:51,397
EARLIER THIS MORNING

108
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:54,108
WAVES ARE CALMER TODAY THAN YESTERDAY

109
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:56,736
We might move because the weather's nice.

110
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:57,904
NOTIFIED GUESTS OF MOVE

111
00:03:57,987 --> 00:04:01,074
We might move,
so you should pack your stuff.

112
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,576
MOVE THE LUGGAGE FROM THE ANNEX

113
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:04,911
Let's go.

114
00:04:06,162 --> 00:04:08,122
Go slowly this time, Ye-eun.

115
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:09,374
Yes, I know.

116
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:11,376
Here we go.

117
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:14,879
THEY RIDE THE BOAT DRIVEN BY CAPTAIN JI

118
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,507
BACK TO THE PORT

119
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:20,468
THEY UNLOAD THE GUESTS' LUGGAGE

120
00:04:20,885 --> 00:04:23,221
LOAD IT ONTO THE BOAT

121
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:26,140
AND GET IN THE BOAT AGAIN

122
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:28,434
Ye-eun, the water's so salty!

123
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:30,270
It can't be helped!

124
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:32,272
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

125
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:33,439
THEY ARRIVE AT THE MAIN B&B

126
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:35,650
Moving all of this inside
is going to be the issue.

127
00:04:35,733 --> 00:04:37,151
-So…
-Yeah?

128
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:40,154
Pass me all the groceries
through that window.

129
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:41,531
-The groceries?
-We'll do that.

130
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:43,741
-Take out just the food and send them in.
-Okay.

131
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:46,077
JIN WILL ORGANIZE THE KITCHEN

132
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:46,995
Be careful.

133
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:49,122
Is this right?

134
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:53,376
HE WHO LAUGHS LASTS

135
00:04:54,752 --> 00:04:58,548
1. CLIMB THE WALL

136
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:02,969
2. SLIDE DOWN THE POLE

137
00:05:03,052 --> 00:05:06,723
HUP, HUP, HUP

138
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,141
Man, it's cool in here.

139
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:11,144
A SHORT BREAK

140
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:13,146
The groceries.

141
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:16,232
ALCOHOL FIRST

142
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:18,901
-Please line them up here.
-Okay.

143
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:20,069
The suitcases…

144
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:21,946
We have to move the suitcases.

145
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:22,947
A BUNCH OF SUITCASES

146
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:26,492
TURNS HIS HEAD

147
00:05:27,076 --> 00:05:29,162
GAZES

148
00:05:32,206 --> 00:05:35,209
-How do we take the luggage up?
-You have to carry it on your back.

149
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:36,169
It's a suitcase.

150
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:37,795
Strap the suitcase onto your back.

151
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:39,714
You have to climb up.

152
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:43,551
GRITS HIS TEETH

153
00:05:44,343 --> 00:05:46,262
STILL TOO MANY

154
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:47,930
TURNS HIS HEAD

155
00:05:48,222 --> 00:05:50,558
STILL TOO HIGH

156
00:05:52,393 --> 00:05:55,730
I keep wanting to make compromises too.

157
00:05:55,813 --> 00:05:57,607
It's human nature to compromise.

158
00:05:58,107 --> 00:06:00,651
I like… the slides.

159
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:02,361
All right.

160
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:04,155
Let's try it.

161
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:17,502
SLIPS

162
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:33,851
Dammit, this is hard too.

163
00:06:39,857 --> 00:06:40,858
Just take one.

164
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:47,281
YE-EUN TRIES TOO

165
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:52,161
Gosh, this is heavy.

166
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:03,548
THE ARCHITECT CAN'T STOP LAUGHING

167
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:11,639
ALMOST THERE

168
00:07:11,722 --> 00:07:12,557
I made it.

169
00:07:13,432 --> 00:07:15,393
Hey, I'm slipping.

170
00:07:15,476 --> 00:07:16,352
Grab the slide.

171
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:17,770
-Go up quick.
-I'm sliding down.

172
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:19,355
I'm sliding down.

173
00:07:20,022 --> 00:07:20,857
Go up.

174
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:32,869
I think we should prioritize bringing in
and organizing the stuff first.

175
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:40,334
I don't have the energy to go up now.

176
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:42,128
My arms are going to fall off.

177
00:07:42,211 --> 00:07:43,421
What are you doing up there?

178
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:45,423
We're moving in the luggage.

179
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:47,550
I SHOULD HELP, BUT…

180
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:50,470
I don't have the strength to go up.

181
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:56,726
BUT I STILL NEED TO GO

182
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:11,574
ROLLS UP HIS PANTS

183
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:13,743
AND TRIES AGAIN

184
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,288
WOBBLES

185
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:32,720
How did you move them up?

186
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:36,766
LIKE THIS

187
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:42,438
Just a bit farther.

188
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:51,489
How many are left, Boss?

189
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,407
-Should I take over?
-What?

190
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:54,325
You want to try?

191
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:57,453
-To be honest, I was so worn out.
-Yeah.

192
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,288
So it wasn't easy to get up the pole.

193
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:01,207
Seriously.

194
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:04,126
This place is unbelievable.

195
00:09:08,756 --> 00:09:09,757
Ye-eun.

196
00:09:10,466 --> 00:09:12,385
He said you can't come up that way.

197
00:09:12,468 --> 00:09:14,845
We can. I got permission to earlier.

198
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:16,931
-From who?
-From Kian84!

199
00:09:17,014 --> 00:09:18,182
FROM KIAN84

200
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:19,225
Boss.

201
00:09:19,308 --> 00:09:20,434
Yeah?

202
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:22,061
Can we use the slides to come up?

203
00:09:22,144 --> 00:09:23,479
What I'm thinking is…

204
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:26,983
HOPEFUL

205
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:28,401
CURIOUS

206
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:32,572
Don't make too many
unnecessary trips up and down.

207
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:34,949
If you do that…

208
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:35,950
UPSET

209
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:38,911
Is there a bathroom down here?

210
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:39,829
-No.
-No.

211
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,290
SPEECHLESS

212
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:44,875
So after we take a shower,

213
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,003
we're supposed to climb up
and be covered in sweat?

214
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:48,462
-Once you get sweaty again…
-Right.

215
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:49,380
Then…

216
00:09:49,463 --> 00:09:52,258
You'll end up deciding
to shower only once a day.

217
00:09:52,341 --> 00:09:54,343
But we can't be smelly
while greeting the guests.

218
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:57,179
The guests will soon become smelly too.

219
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:58,472
The guests too…

220
00:10:00,474 --> 00:10:03,894
If the guests smell too, then it's fair.

221
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:07,148
That's true. He's not wrong.

222
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:09,775
Lately, you've been saying things
that are right.

223
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:12,111
I think you're losing it too
because of me.

224
00:10:12,194 --> 00:10:13,738
No, I think they're all right.

225
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:16,991
If only one person's clean
while everyone smells,

226
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:18,534
-something's wrong with them.
-Right.

227
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:19,952
THE KIAN EFFECT

228
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:20,870
Right.

229
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:23,497
-Let's make the clean feel self-conscious.
-Yeah.

230
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:24,665
-We should.
-Yeah.

231
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:32,256
Lying down here is refreshing.

232
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,924
But the view…

233
00:10:34,675 --> 00:10:37,887
This view from the ocean is beautiful.

234
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,890
And our location
keeps changing little by little.

235
00:10:41,932 --> 00:10:44,602
That was the thing
I really wanted to see while doing this.

236
00:10:44,685 --> 00:10:46,270
That thing on the sea…

237
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:47,521
Moon jitter?

238
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:48,939
WHAT?

239
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:50,524
-Moon glitter?
-Moon glitter.

240
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:52,068
"Moon jitter"!

241
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:55,154
Gosh, that's hilarious.

242
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:57,865
The moon glitters
on rippling waves at night.

243
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:00,826
I thought…

244
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,244
BACK TO BEING SENTIMENTAL

245
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:03,829
That would be amazing to see.

246
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:09,293
SWAYED BY THE WAVES

247
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:14,715
A GRADUALLY CHANGING VIEW CAN BE SEEN

248
00:11:16,592 --> 00:11:18,928
A PLACE FULL OF DREAMS
COLORED BY KIAN

249
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:21,680
MEANWHILE

250
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:24,934
-We got a text.
-What does it say?

251
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:26,852
"Hello, this is Kian's B&B."

252
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:28,896
"Please come to Hyeonpo Port by 7:00 p.m."

253
00:11:28,979 --> 00:11:30,731
"If you're late, your luggage is mine."

254
00:11:31,273 --> 00:11:33,317
HYEONPO PORT?

255
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:35,194
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

256
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:39,198
OFF TO HYEONPO PORT

257
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:40,908
Hyeonpo Port by 7:00 p.m.?

258
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:47,415
I have to go pick up the guests.

259
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:48,833
I'll be back.

260
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:49,959
Okay, be careful.

261
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:56,966
FINALLY, THE FIRST TIME PICKING UP GUESTS

262
00:11:58,008 --> 00:11:59,552
This place looks cool at night.

263
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:00,511
Yeah, it's nice.

264
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:02,430
When are they coming?

265
00:12:03,347 --> 00:12:04,515
I think they're on their way.

266
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:07,226
Hey, then the…

267
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:28,956
That's insane. It really does look great.

268
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:32,376
This place is incredible at night.

269
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:35,838
It looks like a theme park ride.

270
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:37,631
Yeah, it's like a theme park.

271
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:41,093
A theme park from hell.

272
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:45,931
A theme park from hell.

273
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:47,057
"A theme park from hell"!

274
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:48,058
I…

275
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:50,728
I can't feel my arms and back right now!

276
00:12:50,811 --> 00:12:52,646
A THEME PARK THAT NUMBS YOU ALL OVER

277
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:54,106
Damn, it's hot.

278
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:08,287
A SUDDEN BATH

279
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:09,830
What is he doing?

280
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:17,755
WASHES THE ARMPITS

281
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:20,716
He really is an unpredictable person.

282
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:27,348
This is so refreshing.

283
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:29,391
Is this what Kian's B&B is all about?

284
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:39,485
Wow, that's refreshing.

285
00:13:39,568 --> 00:13:42,196
FINISHES CLEANING HIMSELF
BEFORE THE GUESTS ARRIVE

286
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:53,165
There's Ye-eun.

287
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:54,500
TEAM KAIST ARRIVES AT 6:50 P.M.

288
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:56,377
Where are the guests?

289
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:58,546
That's Ye-eun on the boat, right?

290
00:13:58,629 --> 00:13:59,588
We're taking a boat.

291
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:00,506
A BOAT?

292
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:02,508
We're taking a boat. I was right.

293
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:05,386
-Guests of Kian's B&B!
-Yes?

294
00:14:05,469 --> 00:14:06,971
Come this way!

295
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:10,015
Hello.

296
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:11,225
GA-HYUN AND JUN-HEE ARRIVE

297
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:13,102
Pick up? We're not going by car?

298
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:14,186
MEANWHILE, THE NEW GUESTS

299
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:16,105
Wait, Hyeonpo Port is a port.

300
00:14:17,064 --> 00:14:18,023
Hold on.

301
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:21,068
-What's that?
-What?

302
00:14:21,151 --> 00:14:21,986
Up ahead?

303
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:24,655
A ship?

304
00:14:24,738 --> 00:14:25,656
That's the B&B?

305
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:29,368
Isn't that just a cargo ship
that people work on?

306
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:31,245
I have a bad feeling about this.

307
00:14:31,328 --> 00:14:32,329
THAT BAD FEELING

308
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:33,247
BECOMES A REALITY

309
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:35,541
Hello, are you here to stay at Kian's B&B?

310
00:14:35,624 --> 00:14:36,876
Please put on flotation belts.

311
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:37,960
THREE MALE GUESTS ARRIVE

312
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:39,628
I guess you wear it around your waist.

313
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:42,548
A NEW FEMALE GUEST ARRIVES

314
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:52,016
NINE TOTAL GUESTS
FIVE EXISTING GUESTS, FOUR NEW GUESTS

315
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:52,975
Hello.

316
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:56,103
Hi, are you the new female guest?

317
00:14:56,186 --> 00:14:57,229
Yes, I am.

318
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:59,857
-But I have more luggage.
-Yes, your luggage.

319
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,317
Could you help me with it?

320
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:03,611
Thank you.

321
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:06,488
We have to move the lumber.

322
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:08,908
What? For what?

323
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:10,075
Are you a carpenter?

324
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:10,993
I am.

325
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:15,080
NEW GUEST
LEE AH-JIN, CARPENTER

326
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:16,957
There you go.

327
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:19,501
-I stepped on your foot.
-Thank you.

328
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:20,753
-I'm sorry.
-No, it's fine.

329
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:23,255
-Do you have your flotation belts on?
-Yes.

330
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:25,215
-I'm driving.
-What?

331
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:27,092
I want to get off!

332
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:29,678
-No way.
-I want to get off!

333
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:31,347
NO WAY

334
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:35,517
Have faith in me. Everyone, hold tight.

335
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:38,938
Those in the back need to sit.
It could be dangerous.

336
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:41,899
-My eye is twitching.
-I really want to live.

337
00:15:41,982 --> 00:15:43,400
I got my license.

338
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:45,694
This is how
disaster movies typically start.

339
00:15:46,987 --> 00:15:51,241
YE-EUN'S BOAT SETS OFF

340
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:53,494
WOW

341
00:15:53,577 --> 00:15:55,120
WHOA

342
00:15:57,247 --> 00:15:58,582
I'm going to speed up.

343
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:00,751
This is so cool.

344
00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:02,544
It's going fast.

345
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:08,717
Wow, what's that?

346
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:11,845
What is that shining island?

347
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:15,307
That's amazing.

348
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:17,768
-What is it?
-I can see lights.

349
00:16:19,603 --> 00:16:20,437
Oh my!

350
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:22,731
That's so cool!

351
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:25,359
It was like the animated movies.

352
00:16:25,442 --> 00:16:29,071
The colors and lights
were far beyond imagination.

353
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:30,072
It's flashy.

354
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:32,533
It's a bit unusual.

355
00:16:34,201 --> 00:16:36,704
It felt like a bizarre theme park.

356
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:39,665
With its spires and bright yellow color,

357
00:16:39,748 --> 00:16:40,916
it really catches your eye.

358
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,835
Shock. Horror. Fear?

359
00:16:42,918 --> 00:16:46,046
Some kind of fishing boat
slowly got closer.

360
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:47,381
It turned out to be our B&B.

361
00:16:47,464 --> 00:16:48,882
THE FISHING BOAT IS OUR B&B?

362
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:51,301
Look, there's a climbing wall on the side!

363
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:53,053
So that's how we have to go up.

364
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:54,054
You're right.

365
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:56,140
-That's crazy.
-Wait. I mean…

366
00:16:56,223 --> 00:16:58,475
Wait, why does that lead into the sea?

367
00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:01,520
Hey, the slide really leads into the sea!

368
00:17:01,603 --> 00:17:02,479
They made this?

369
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:03,981
GUESTS FLUSTERED BY THE BIZARRE B&B

370
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:05,274
I'm so amazed.

371
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:08,652
-He's excited.
-He is.

372
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:10,487
It has a climbing wall there.

373
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:12,031
THE BIZARRE OWNER IS HERE TOO

374
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:15,034
It's in the middle of the sea.

375
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:16,410
We'll need motion-sickness meds.

376
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:18,245
We'll probably need those.

377
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:20,456
Grab my wrist.

378
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:22,916
-Hello.
-Hello.

379
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:23,876
Hello.

380
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:25,794
-Hello.
-Hello.

381
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:29,298
-Did you have a good time?
-Yes.

382
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:31,842
What gave you the idea to put a B&B here?

383
00:17:31,925 --> 00:17:32,760
Here?

384
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:35,304
I didn't expect this
to actually happen either.

385
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:37,973
Hello!

386
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:39,183
Hello.

387
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:41,101
ALL GUESTS CHECK IN AT THE MAIN B&B

388
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:42,936
I'm Kian, the owner of the B&B.

389
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,480
Your beds…

390
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:47,024
have been set up outside.

391
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:48,358
OUTSIDE?

392
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:50,277
So that's the sleeping area.

393
00:17:51,653 --> 00:17:53,238
I didn't think they were actual beds.

394
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:54,615
I thought they were decorations.

395
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:59,787
The entrance is on the second floor.
You can't go in through the first floor.

396
00:18:02,664 --> 00:18:04,374
You need to enter
through the second floor.

397
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:06,085
And when you come down…

398
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:07,002
The slides.

399
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:08,754
-Don't get confused!
-Okay.

400
00:18:08,837 --> 00:18:10,297
You have to take the pink one.

401
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:12,049
So that's why there's two!

402
00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:15,260
The yellow one will take you into the sea.

403
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:17,346
Anyone who's scared
can put this on to go up.

404
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:18,847
TIME TO ENTER KIAN'S B&B

405
00:18:19,556 --> 00:18:22,392
Also, if you think
the beginner's course is too easy,

406
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:24,645
it gets harder the further right you go.

407
00:18:24,728 --> 00:18:26,688
I'll show you how to go up.

408
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:27,731
Yes, please show us.

409
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:28,649
JIN THE DEMONSTRATOR

410
00:18:28,732 --> 00:18:30,067
Show us how.

411
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:31,193
Oh no, my nails…

412
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:33,862
-Today was my first time doing this too.
-Show us.

413
00:18:38,158 --> 00:18:39,701
You go up like that.

414
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:40,911
He's good at it now.

415
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:42,830
-You're so good, Jin.
-He's improved.

416
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:46,500
-Look at him go.
-Yes, he's gotten better.

417
00:18:50,003 --> 00:18:51,213
That's how you go up.

418
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:54,633
But if you come down,
you always have to climb up like this.

419
00:18:54,716 --> 00:18:56,051
Put down a ladder for us.

420
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:57,719
Please make us some stairs.

421
00:18:57,803 --> 00:18:59,263
This is ridiculous.

422
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:01,348
Everyone, I was thinking…

423
00:19:01,431 --> 00:19:03,767
Since we all enter our homes so easily,

424
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:06,728
I wanted to see what it'd be like
to make it harder to enter.

425
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:08,355
I SEE

426
00:19:08,438 --> 00:19:10,149
I've never done climbing before.

427
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:12,526
Anyone think they can do it?

428
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:14,486
-Should I go first?
-Sure, go ahead.

429
00:19:15,737 --> 00:19:17,072
I think he might be good at this.

430
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:19,199
Is it okay to use a different route?

431
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:20,868
So cool!

432
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:23,203
Wow, a different route.

433
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:25,247
The way he chalked his hands
was different.

434
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:32,588
Wow, he's good!

435
00:19:40,095 --> 00:19:41,597
He must be a pro.

436
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:47,853
He's just comfortably
hanging from the wall.

437
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:49,980
Wow, he's good!

438
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:52,191
He's so good at it.

439
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,109
I feel embarrassed.

440
00:19:56,737 --> 00:19:58,780
I'll go up the blue route.

441
00:19:59,823 --> 00:20:01,825
-Wait, who are these guys?
-How are they so good?

442
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:03,994
-How are they so good?
-Look at him go.

443
00:20:04,077 --> 00:20:05,996
-Who are these guys?
-How are they so good?

444
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:08,123
Oh, my gosh!

445
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:10,626
-Oh, my gosh.
-Hold on. Wow.

446
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:11,793
He's flying up.

447
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:15,756
Seriously, who are you guys?

448
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:16,673
INTIMIDATED

449
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:20,552
My goodness!

450
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:23,305
He's so good.

451
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:25,224
My goodness!

452
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:27,643
He has the forearms of an athlete.

453
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:32,022
What on earth?
These people have abnormal muscles.

454
00:20:37,986 --> 00:20:39,821
KANG MIN-JUN

455
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:44,368
KIM TAE-IN

456
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,579
SHIM MIN-SEOB

457
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:11,603
-Let's go, KAIST.
-Give it a try, Team KAIST.

458
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:14,189
-Okay.
-Rock, paper, scissors, shoot.

459
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:15,440
Rock, paper, scissors, shoot.

460
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:17,192
-Yes!
-Rock, paper, scissors, shoot.

461
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:18,694
Give it a try.

462
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:20,153
Want to wear the harness?

463
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:21,655
-If you fall, you'll be safe.
-Okay.

464
00:21:21,738 --> 00:21:23,448
We should go help them put on the harness.

465
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:26,451
-You can take the slide down.
-Got it.

466
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:28,578
Yippee.

467
00:21:29,746 --> 00:21:32,249
-We're professional climbers.
-What?

468
00:21:32,332 --> 00:21:34,042
-I knew it.
-Really?

469
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:37,129
-They chalked their hands like pros.
-We're also instructors.

470
00:21:37,212 --> 00:21:40,090
Then, you can teach people
who can't climb how to go up?

471
00:21:40,173 --> 00:21:42,009
-We can help them go up.
-Then…

472
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:43,760
For our other guests…

473
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:45,846
-Really?
-You could teach them.

474
00:21:45,929 --> 00:21:46,763
WE'LL SEND YOU UP

475
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:48,056
Fasten this higher.

476
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,725
I can't believe I'm learning this here.

477
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:51,518
That's it. One.

478
00:21:51,601 --> 00:21:53,020
Lift your right foot up.

479
00:21:53,103 --> 00:21:57,607
I thought if I can't climb this wall,
I won't be able to do anything here.

480
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:02,195
AT KIAN'S B&B, CLIMBING IS SURVIVING
SUNG-HO

481
00:22:02,946 --> 00:22:04,990
If I can't climb up,
I can't enter the B&B.

482
00:22:05,073 --> 00:22:06,325
We have no choice but to do it.

483
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:07,242
Watch your feet.

484
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:08,994
This isn't easy.

485
00:22:09,786 --> 00:22:11,413
-It'll be easier if you grab this.
-Okay.

486
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:12,831
CLIMBING IS A CHALLENGE
SEONG-EUN

487
00:22:12,914 --> 00:22:14,708
They're all managing to go up.

488
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:16,209
It's comforting to have them here.

489
00:22:17,044 --> 00:22:20,422
The entrance is on the second floor,
and we have to climb to get there.

490
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:22,507
That was really hard.

491
00:22:23,216 --> 00:22:24,509
I'll push you up a bit.

492
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:26,261
Look up. There you go.

493
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:27,721
Lift your foot up more.

494
00:22:27,804 --> 00:22:29,514
-With your big toe.
-That's it.

495
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:30,891
Then, grab this yellow one.

496
00:22:30,974 --> 00:22:32,267
That's it.

497
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:33,602
Okay, come inside.

498
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:34,644
TEAM KAIST MAKES IT IN

499
00:22:34,728 --> 00:22:36,396
They did well.

500
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,774
-It's reassuring to have experts here.
-Exactly.

501
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:40,984
Try climbing up.

502
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:44,613
AH-JIN'S TRY

503
00:22:48,658 --> 00:22:50,494
Where do I go from here?

504
00:22:50,577 --> 00:22:52,245
-Can you reach the yellow hold?
-Yes.

505
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:53,830
Okay. Now, lift your foot up.

506
00:22:53,914 --> 00:22:54,831
Yes, that's it.

507
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:56,666
-Then, this handle.
-Grab this.

508
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:57,709
Wow, this is so…

509
00:22:57,793 --> 00:22:59,044
Come in this way.

510
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:05,425
NEXT UP IS JUN-HEE

511
00:23:05,509 --> 00:23:08,595
It had a lot of elements
related to sports, so I liked it.

512
00:23:08,678 --> 00:23:10,514
I really like things like that.

513
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:13,725
Hey, it's not that bad.

514
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:15,435
You think you can give it a try?

515
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:18,271
I think I can if I wear that harness.

516
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:19,898
And we have instructors here.

517
00:23:19,981 --> 00:23:21,108
You have to step into it.

518
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:23,068
PUTS ON THE HARNESS

519
00:23:23,693 --> 00:23:26,822
GA-HYUN'S TRY

520
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:29,991
The yellow ones are good.

521
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:32,369
To reach the second floor,

522
00:23:32,452 --> 00:23:34,621
we had to climb a wall to get there.

523
00:23:34,704 --> 00:23:37,457
It was beyond anything
I could have imagined,

524
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:39,459
so that was the hardest thing for me.

525
00:23:41,044 --> 00:23:43,088
-Thank you.
-Sure, come inside.

526
00:23:43,171 --> 00:23:45,257
ALL GUESTS SUCCESSFULLY CLIMB UP

527
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:47,634
-They did well.
-They did.

528
00:23:47,717 --> 00:23:50,345
We need to haul those suitcases up.

529
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:53,056
IT'S TIME FOR THE LUGGAGE NOW

530
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:54,307
Then, the luggage…

531
00:23:54,391 --> 00:23:55,684
-Take them up now?
-Yeah.

532
00:23:56,560 --> 00:24:01,481
DELIVERING THE LUGGAGE WITH THE SLIDE

533
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:02,858
You don't need a hand with them?

534
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:04,568
No, it's fine.

535
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:11,491
Nice.

536
00:24:13,743 --> 00:24:15,662
It's nice having the instructors here.

537
00:24:15,745 --> 00:24:16,913
Look at them lift these in.

538
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:18,165
I guess this is another way.

539
00:24:18,248 --> 00:24:19,416
The instructors!

540
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:21,293
They're so smart.

541
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:26,214
WE DID IT THE HARD WAY

542
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:27,924
I guess this is another way.

543
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:35,599
We've lost our jobs now.

544
00:24:35,682 --> 00:24:37,142
Do we get paid for this?

545
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:40,478
We'll make you a nice dinner.

546
00:24:40,562 --> 00:24:42,355
Well, that should be plenty.

547
00:24:42,939 --> 00:24:45,901
I hope these guys don't go home.

548
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:48,403
Yeah, I hope they never go.

549
00:24:48,486 --> 00:24:51,072
Our climbing guys,
how many nights are you staying?

550
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:54,993
We'll be here until Saturday morning.

551
00:24:55,076 --> 00:24:56,912
-Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday.
-Yes.

552
00:24:56,995 --> 00:24:58,830
-Three nights? That's quite long.
-Yes.

553
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:00,790
Please take a seat.

554
00:25:00,874 --> 00:25:02,667
Where should I start?

555
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:05,086
The dining room is below.

556
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:07,339
But with the dining room,

557
00:25:07,422 --> 00:25:09,591
rather than just walking there…

558
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:11,718
That's why the pole is…

559
00:25:11,801 --> 00:25:14,471
I really like High Kick!

560
00:25:16,056 --> 00:25:17,891
Lee Soon-jae used to climb
a pole on the show.

561
00:25:18,475 --> 00:25:19,726
We made this with that in mind.

562
00:25:19,809 --> 00:25:23,438
How about we head down and make dinner?

563
00:25:23,521 --> 00:25:25,440
-Shall we open this lid?
-Okay.

564
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:28,109
This is…

565
00:25:29,152 --> 00:25:31,071
-the first floor.
-It's a long way down.

566
00:25:31,154 --> 00:25:32,322
The first floor.

567
00:25:32,405 --> 00:25:33,657
I don't think I could climb up.

568
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:35,116
I'll go down first.

569
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:37,535
-Just like this.
-It looks fun.

570
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:39,412
THE OWNER DESCENDS FIRST

571
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:41,289
That looks painful.

572
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:42,791
Just like Lee Soon-jae.

573
00:25:48,129 --> 00:25:49,339
Just as we thought.

574
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:53,426
Just as we thought.
That military experience!

575
00:25:55,345 --> 00:25:56,179
That was cool.

576
00:25:56,263 --> 00:25:58,682
-That was cool.
-I'm an expert.

577
00:26:01,434 --> 00:26:02,978
You can come down one by one.

578
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:05,272
Anyone who thinks they can go?

579
00:26:05,355 --> 00:26:07,274
We have to eat.

580
00:26:07,357 --> 00:26:09,150
-We have to eat.
-I'll catch you.

581
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:12,862
-Geez.
-It's okay.

582
00:26:12,946 --> 00:26:14,406
-Geez.
-It's okay.

583
00:26:14,489 --> 00:26:15,824
-I got it.
-You did well.

584
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:18,034
Gosh, this guy.

585
00:26:18,994 --> 00:26:21,830
THIS GUY
KI-HONG DESCENDS

586
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:27,585
-They're good!
-You did well.

587
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:30,005
-The pros are…
-The pros…

588
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:32,048
The pros are on a different level.

589
00:26:32,132 --> 00:26:33,008
STEADY

590
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:36,594
It was really unique.

591
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:38,430
This is scary.

592
00:26:38,513 --> 00:26:41,099
It was the most Kian-esque feature.

593
00:26:41,182 --> 00:26:42,600
Why are you so good at this?

594
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:46,521
Rather than a house,

595
00:26:46,604 --> 00:26:48,106
it was like a playground for adults.

596
00:26:49,524 --> 00:26:52,235
It felt like I was starting
a new adventure.

597
00:26:54,696 --> 00:26:57,699
They were all using the features
I'd imagined for them.

598
00:26:57,782 --> 00:26:58,700
That was when…

599
00:26:59,826 --> 00:27:01,202
I felt really happy.

600
00:27:04,331 --> 00:27:07,000
Sir, then where is the bathroom?

601
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:09,878
For the bathroom, go up the pole
and down the slide.

602
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:11,129
Okay.

603
00:27:11,212 --> 00:27:12,630
And go around to the back.

604
00:27:13,381 --> 00:27:14,841
Up, down, and to the back.

605
00:27:14,924 --> 00:27:17,510
The bathroom is next to the gym.

606
00:27:19,429 --> 00:27:20,472
I don't think I can do it.

607
00:27:20,555 --> 00:27:21,556
So with this…

608
00:27:21,639 --> 00:27:24,559
For people who can't go up,
we found a way.

609
00:27:24,642 --> 00:27:26,561
-Could you help me?
-Sure.

610
00:27:26,644 --> 00:27:28,897
Each person will grab hold of a foot.

611
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,440
You put your foot here.

612
00:27:30,523 --> 00:27:31,524
Oh, my God.

613
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:34,110
You'll need to hold on tight to the pole.

614
00:27:36,404 --> 00:27:37,781
-Just place your feet here.
-Oh my.

615
00:27:37,864 --> 00:27:39,240
Grab it tight and lift your feet.

616
00:27:39,949 --> 00:27:41,284
I'm sorry!

617
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:45,288
HUMAN ELEVATOR

618
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:53,588
My goodness.
I thought she came up by herself.

619
00:27:55,465 --> 00:27:57,300
Could you explain
where the bathroom is again?

620
00:27:57,384 --> 00:27:58,802
-The bathroom?
-Yes.

621
00:27:58,885 --> 00:28:01,262
Go outside and go around to the right.

622
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:02,180
Okay, I got it.

623
00:28:02,263 --> 00:28:04,057
Can we go check out the gym?

624
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:04,974
Of course.

625
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:07,268
OFF TO THE BATHROOM

626
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:12,440
OFF TO THE GYM

627
00:28:13,316 --> 00:28:15,568
It has a pull-up bar and other stuff too.

628
00:28:16,694 --> 00:28:17,862
This is nice.

629
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:22,700
-It's the bathroom
-That's the bathroom.

630
00:28:22,784 --> 00:28:23,701
GYM, BATHROOM, SHOWER

631
00:28:23,785 --> 00:28:24,911
That's the shower room.

632
00:28:27,414 --> 00:28:28,623
THE OWNER COMES BACK DOWN

633
00:28:28,706 --> 00:28:29,541
Come on down.

634
00:28:31,584 --> 00:28:34,421
-I can't do this!
-Really? I thought you'd be good at this.

635
00:28:34,504 --> 00:28:36,131
-Be careful.
-I can't do this!

636
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:38,341
It's okay if it's too scary.
You don't have to.

637
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:39,551
Will you be okay?

638
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:41,886
You don't have to.

639
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:42,929
WORRIED

640
00:28:43,012 --> 00:28:44,055
He's coming back up.

641
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:45,557
I think he's coming back up.

642
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:48,226
Oh my.

643
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:51,688
Dammit, this is exhausting.

644
00:28:52,772 --> 00:28:54,566
I can't believe I designed this.

645
00:28:54,649 --> 00:28:55,984
I'm going to lose my mind.

646
00:28:56,067 --> 00:28:57,235
Are you okay?

647
00:28:57,318 --> 00:28:59,362
What do we do with the guests
who can't go down?

648
00:28:59,446 --> 00:29:02,615
Would this be too hard for them?

649
00:29:02,699 --> 00:29:05,034
We're going to reinforce the bottom here.

650
00:29:05,118 --> 00:29:06,703
I really want to go down.

651
00:29:11,666 --> 00:29:14,461
Man, I really can't do this.

652
00:29:14,544 --> 00:29:15,462
Your feet.

653
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:18,047
Gosh, I'm sorry!

654
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:21,718
Wait, hold on.

655
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:25,263
Careful.

656
00:29:26,806 --> 00:29:28,308
What are we going to do with this?

657
00:29:30,894 --> 00:29:32,771
This won't work. Should we close it?

658
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:33,938
Yeah, this won't do.

659
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:35,648
Do we decide to close the first floor?

660
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:39,819
THE OWNER FACES A DILEMMA

661
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:44,699
-At least for tonight…
-Yeah?

662
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:46,326
Let's eat outside.

663
00:29:47,702 --> 00:29:48,828
They can't come down.

664
00:29:48,912 --> 00:29:50,038
Why not?

665
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:51,414
They can't use the pole.

666
00:29:51,498 --> 00:29:53,458
I don't want to force them to use it.

667
00:29:53,541 --> 00:29:56,169
-So you know our carpenter guest?
-Yeah.

668
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:58,296
Let's make a ladder here.

669
00:29:58,379 --> 00:30:00,256
That strays a lot
from your original intent.

670
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:02,091
-I'm sorry.
-Then, go upstairs.

671
00:30:02,175 --> 00:30:03,760
And move the ingredients.

672
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:05,553
-Take this first.
-Okay.

673
00:30:06,429 --> 00:30:08,181
We can cook the stew and rice here first.

674
00:30:08,264 --> 00:30:09,516
Sure.

675
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:11,017
Let's cook them here and move them.

676
00:30:11,434 --> 00:30:14,521
THE OWNER LEAVES
TO SET UP THE AREA OUTSIDE

677
00:30:15,104 --> 00:30:17,232
JIN PREPARES DINNER IN THE KITCHEN

678
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:21,820
TODAY'S MENU
JIN'S BEEF BRISKET AND SOYBEAN PASTE STEW

679
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:26,491
There's no garlic or green onions.

680
00:30:26,574 --> 00:30:28,701
THE CONSEQUENCE OF THE MOVE

681
00:30:28,785 --> 00:30:29,994
The cutting board…

682
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:33,748
is also missing.

683
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:36,334
ANOTHER CONSEQUENCE OF THE MOVE

684
00:30:36,417 --> 00:30:38,336
IF THERE'S NO CUTTING BOARD?

685
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:48,179
STIR-FRYING THE BEEF BRISKET

686
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:52,100
ADDS THE VEGETABLES

687
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:56,479
AND PLENTY OF SOYBEAN PASTE

688
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:04,362
JIN'S BEEF BRISKET AND SOYBEAN PASTE STEW
IS COMING ALONG NICELY

689
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:09,617
OFF TO SET UP THE AREA OUTSIDE

690
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:11,035
We can eat here.

691
00:31:11,661 --> 00:31:13,162
-Goodness!
-We can eat here, Kian.

692
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:15,790
Hey… What was I going to say?

693
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:18,960
You can't make it downstairs, right?

694
00:31:19,043 --> 00:31:19,961
I can't.

695
00:31:20,044 --> 00:31:21,379
Even if you want to cook.

696
00:31:21,462 --> 00:31:22,714
We'll need a ladder tomorrow.

697
00:31:22,797 --> 00:31:24,924
You know what's gradually
becoming the problem?

698
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:26,134
What?

699
00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:28,219
I don't want to go inside.

700
00:31:30,513 --> 00:31:32,765
Why would he make the B&B like this?

701
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:34,893
What was he thinking?

702
00:31:34,976 --> 00:31:36,561
Why on earth is he so…

703
00:31:37,812 --> 00:31:40,690
We have a carpenter here.
So you know what I was thinking?

704
00:31:40,773 --> 00:31:41,608
What?

705
00:31:42,358 --> 00:31:43,860
"Should we make a first floor door?"

706
00:31:43,943 --> 00:31:45,612
Seriously, can't you make us one?

707
00:31:46,195 --> 00:31:48,281
Kian, people inherently do

708
00:31:48,364 --> 00:31:50,199
what's comfortable for them.

709
00:31:50,283 --> 00:31:52,410
But I saw this coming.

710
00:31:52,493 --> 00:31:55,079
I thought I'd eventually want
to make a door.

711
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:57,165
-I expected to after two or three days.
-Right.

712
00:31:57,248 --> 00:32:00,168
-But it happened too soon?
-It happened in only half a day.

713
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:02,170
With the guests actually here, I softened.

714
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:03,588
Yeah, I softened.

715
00:32:03,671 --> 00:32:05,340
I worried people might get hurt.

716
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:07,508
I think it might be good to make a door.

717
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:08,885
Boss!

718
00:32:08,968 --> 00:32:09,886
So…

719
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:12,138
How about we make…

720
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,682
a door on the first floor?

721
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:20,355
I mean, we have a carpenter here.

722
00:32:21,731 --> 00:32:23,107
It's because we have a carpenter.

723
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:24,692
So I think it's a good idea.

724
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:26,361
And with this climbing wall,

725
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:28,279
we can also…

726
00:32:28,363 --> 00:32:29,364
You know…

727
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:30,615
I think…

728
00:32:30,698 --> 00:32:32,909
I think we shouldn't make a door.

729
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:37,080
It's fun going up and down.

730
00:32:37,163 --> 00:32:39,415
Earlier, we lifted the carpenter
up like this.

731
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:41,334
But… Right.

732
00:32:41,417 --> 00:32:43,294
Whoever comes down,
we can lift them back up.

733
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:44,295
That's true.

734
00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:45,755
I don't think we need it.

735
00:32:45,838 --> 00:32:47,548
Right, but I'm…

736
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:50,009
There's no compromising with him.

737
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:52,971
It's about dreams.
It's nothing without them.

738
00:32:54,931 --> 00:32:56,683
I guess this is why being an owner's hard.

739
00:32:57,308 --> 00:32:58,893
People have differing opinions.

740
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:00,186
PRINCIPLE VS COMPROMISE

741
00:33:00,269 --> 00:33:01,270
But I think…

742
00:33:01,354 --> 00:33:02,397
THE TWO PHILOSOPHIES CLASH

743
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,856
You shouldn't compromise.

744
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:04,941
I shouldn't?

745
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:06,359
Then, you wouldn't be the owner.

746
00:33:06,442 --> 00:33:07,360
True.

747
00:33:07,443 --> 00:33:09,862
-You'd just be a boatswain.
-A boatswain.

748
00:33:09,946 --> 00:33:11,864
Please make us a door.

749
00:33:11,948 --> 00:33:14,200
I'm so grateful to have you tell me that.

750
00:33:15,785 --> 00:33:17,161
Ye-eun doesn't look very happy.

751
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:18,454
No…

752
00:33:18,538 --> 00:33:21,958
I mean, this is exactly
what you had in mind.

753
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:25,169
It's no wonder he's a global star.

754
00:33:25,253 --> 00:33:27,797
He clearly understands
the intent of my design.

755
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:30,675
I waver because of Ye-eun
and refocus because of Jin.

756
00:33:30,758 --> 00:33:32,260
Ye-eun is a Seoul girl.

757
00:33:32,343 --> 00:33:34,887
SEOUL GIRL

758
00:33:34,971 --> 00:33:36,264
Jin is

759
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:38,933
my world-class anchor.

760
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:40,018
You can't compromise.

761
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:46,482
Let's set up a place to eat.

762
00:33:46,566 --> 00:33:47,942
Wait, we don't have a table.

763
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:50,236
I think we should empty out
one of those basins.

764
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:52,697
How about flipping
the biggest one over to use as a table?

765
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:53,698
Flip that basin?

766
00:33:53,781 --> 00:33:54,615
Flip it.

767
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:56,701
-We don't have anything else to use.
-Right.

768
00:33:57,869 --> 00:33:59,328
FOLLOW THE WORLD CLASS ANCHOR

769
00:33:59,412 --> 00:34:01,497
Should we move it there?

770
00:34:01,581 --> 00:34:03,291
-Next to that basin?
-Is it full of water?

771
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:04,417
One, two, three.

772
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:05,501
Goodness.

773
00:34:14,677 --> 00:34:16,429
-It's a little small.
-Yeah, it is.

774
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:18,389
Flip another one?

775
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:20,391
It's not bad as a table.

776
00:34:23,186 --> 00:34:25,396
-It's not bad.
-One for sitting and one for standing?

777
00:34:27,857 --> 00:34:29,108
Let's pour out this one.

778
00:34:29,192 --> 00:34:30,234
One, two, three.

779
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:31,402
Wait, hold on.

780
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:34,781
Three. Wait.

781
00:34:34,864 --> 00:34:36,365
Three. Wait.

782
00:34:38,034 --> 00:34:39,368
-One, two…
-Wait.

783
00:34:39,452 --> 00:34:40,578
-One…
-Let me get ready.

784
00:34:40,661 --> 00:34:42,288
Let me take some deep breaths.

785
00:34:42,371 --> 00:34:44,207
-We can do this.
-Of course, we can.

786
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:46,292
-We can do this.
-Of course, we can.

787
00:34:46,375 --> 00:34:47,752
-One, two, three.
-One, two, three.

788
00:34:50,379 --> 00:34:52,131
NOT MOVING

789
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:54,133
STRAINING

790
00:34:54,217 --> 00:34:55,968
STRAINING TOO

791
00:34:56,052 --> 00:34:58,137
-We need Ye-eun's help.
-Good idea.

792
00:34:58,596 --> 00:34:59,972
A SWIFT SURRENDER

793
00:35:00,056 --> 00:35:02,475
One of the climbers is there.

794
00:35:02,558 --> 00:35:04,769
-Let's ask for a little help.
-Excuse me?

795
00:35:04,852 --> 00:35:06,104
Could you lend us a hand, sir?

796
00:35:06,187 --> 00:35:07,021
Sure.

797
00:35:09,398 --> 00:35:10,983
You've worked out a lot before though.

798
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:13,027
-Yeah, but…
-So it's this basin.

799
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:14,195
-We'll lift it.
-Okay.

800
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:16,239
Could you hold up the bottom

801
00:35:16,322 --> 00:35:17,740
-to pour the water out?
-Yes, sure.

802
00:35:17,824 --> 00:35:18,950
-One, two.
-One, two, three!

803
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:22,161
Okay.

804
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:31,295
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

805
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:33,631
Kian, we were such idiots.

806
00:35:35,216 --> 00:35:38,344
Instead of asking for help,
we could've just scooped the water out.

807
00:35:41,347 --> 00:35:43,224
-Like this? Nice.
-Like a standing table.

808
00:35:47,937 --> 00:35:49,397
I have to climb up the wall again.

809
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:55,153
I have to climb again.

810
00:35:59,198 --> 00:36:01,159
Boss, we really shouldn't compromise.

811
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:02,076
Okay.

812
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,286
Climbing is the only way up.

813
00:36:03,369 --> 00:36:04,370
But where are you going?

814
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:07,331
I have to get all the food.

815
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:11,460
This is the most inefficient house
in the whole world.

816
00:36:13,379 --> 00:36:14,422
You can't compromise.

817
00:36:15,089 --> 00:36:17,925
CAN'T COMPROMISE

818
00:36:33,816 --> 00:36:36,235
Everyone, please use the wall
when going up.

819
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:38,279
KIAN'S B&B RULES
CLIMB THE WALL TO ENTER THE B&B

820
00:36:38,654 --> 00:36:40,489
HERE COMES THE SLIDE POLICE

821
00:36:40,573 --> 00:36:42,158
Guys, you were on your way down, right?

822
00:36:42,241 --> 00:36:43,409
Yes, we were coming down.

823
00:36:43,492 --> 00:36:44,785
Right? They were coming down.

824
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:46,746
-Is that so?
-Climbing is too hard.

825
00:36:48,164 --> 00:36:50,249
We're going down, Ki-hong.
What are you doing?

826
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:54,629
THE OWNER IS MOVING THE INGREDIENTS

827
00:36:54,962 --> 00:36:58,883
ONLY THE INGREDIENTS ARE ALLOWED
TO PASS THROUGH THE WINDOW

828
00:37:03,262 --> 00:37:07,433
UP THE POLE AGAIN

829
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:10,102
Oh my, that startled me!

830
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:13,981
You're actually climbing this
as it rattles away.

831
00:37:19,654 --> 00:37:20,571
-Ye-eun.
-Yes?

832
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:21,864
-Let's move these.
-Okay.

833
00:37:24,158 --> 00:37:25,618
Do you need this tofu?

834
00:37:25,701 --> 00:37:26,827
Yeah, it goes in the stew.

835
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:29,247
I have to slice the tofu.

836
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:31,624
-Climbing pros.
-Yes?

837
00:37:31,707 --> 00:37:33,000
I'm sorry, but…

838
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:35,544
Could you toss me
a spoon from the kitchen?

839
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:37,213
-The kitchen?
-Yes.

840
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:39,090
Go down the pole.

841
00:37:39,799 --> 00:37:40,841
I'll go.

842
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:42,510
Don't we need a lot of spoons?

843
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:44,637
I need at least one for the stew.

844
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,639
But he's already inside.

845
00:37:46,722 --> 00:37:47,723
-So ask for more.
-Right.

846
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:49,475
Since you're there, a lot of spoons.

847
00:37:49,558 --> 00:37:50,559
-A lot?
-A lot of spoons.

848
00:37:50,643 --> 00:37:52,270
-Ask for everything needed.
-Chopsticks!

849
00:37:52,353 --> 00:37:54,146
Quickly tell us everything you need.

850
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:55,523
Spoons, chopsticks, and cups.

851
00:37:55,606 --> 00:37:57,525
A lot of spoons and chopsticks.

852
00:37:57,608 --> 00:37:59,402
A lot of spoons and chopsticks.

853
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:03,155
Spoons and chopsticks?

854
00:38:03,864 --> 00:38:04,824
We have them here.

855
00:38:05,574 --> 00:38:08,077
-Where are the spoons?
-He said they're here.

856
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,620
Is there any MSG in there?

857
00:38:09,704 --> 00:38:11,664
I'll get you some MSG.

858
00:38:12,748 --> 00:38:15,793
There's a bag
with all the seasonings in it.

859
00:38:15,876 --> 00:38:16,752
This.

860
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:18,004
-What?
-Oh, this?

861
00:38:18,087 --> 00:38:20,172
There's soy sauce, MSG, and sugar here.

862
00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:22,800
Thank you.

863
00:38:22,883 --> 00:38:24,427
Excuse me. I'm sorry, but…

864
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:26,053
Could you fill these with water?

865
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:28,180
Fill them both about halfway.

866
00:38:28,264 --> 00:38:29,473
-Halfway? Okay.
-Yes.

867
00:38:29,557 --> 00:38:31,684
HERE ARE YOUR POTS OF WATER

868
00:38:31,767 --> 00:38:34,020
Could you rinse these
for us by any chance?

869
00:38:34,103 --> 00:38:34,979
Sure.

870
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:39,984
GARLIC WASHED AND READY

871
00:38:40,067 --> 00:38:41,902
Here's the rice!

872
00:38:42,903 --> 00:38:44,530
Please take the rice.

873
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:46,115
Thank you.

874
00:38:46,866 --> 00:38:47,700
This is…

875
00:38:47,783 --> 00:38:48,826
Anything else?

876
00:38:49,493 --> 00:38:51,370
-Is that really it?
-Yes.

877
00:38:51,454 --> 00:38:52,288
They said that's it.

878
00:38:52,371 --> 00:38:53,414
Got it.

879
00:38:58,794 --> 00:39:02,131
COMPLETES ALL MISSIONS
WHILE IN THE KITCHEN

880
00:39:06,052 --> 00:39:08,262
9:00 P.M.

881
00:39:09,221 --> 00:39:11,474
YE-EUN GRILLS THE PORK BELLY AGAIN TODAY

882
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:13,601
JIN IS ALMOST DONE WITH THE STEW

883
00:39:15,269 --> 00:39:16,729
SCOOPING THE TOFU WITH A SPOON

884
00:39:16,812 --> 00:39:19,273
I've never scooped tofu like this before.

885
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:20,900
Oh, this.

886
00:39:21,984 --> 00:39:23,903
Don't we need ssamjang
as a dip for the meat?

887
00:39:23,986 --> 00:39:25,446
-We need it for the meat.
-Right?

888
00:39:25,529 --> 00:39:26,697
And less for the stew, right?

889
00:39:26,781 --> 00:39:28,866
Do you normally put ssamjang
in soybean paste stew?

890
00:39:28,949 --> 00:39:30,701
All barbecue restaurants use it in stews.

891
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:31,994
-Really?
-Really.

892
00:39:32,078 --> 00:39:33,162
Is that so?

893
00:39:33,245 --> 00:39:34,497
Then, just a spoonful?

894
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:35,456
Just a spoonful.

895
00:39:37,291 --> 00:39:42,254
THE KICK IN JIN'S STEW COMES FROM
SSAMJANG

896
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:46,300
THE BEEF BRISKET AND SOYBEAN PASTE STEW
IS COMPLETE

897
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:49,553
YE-EUN'S GRILLED PORK BELLY IS READY TOO

898
00:39:49,637 --> 00:39:51,138
Wow, this looks amazing.

899
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:55,893
THE OWNER PREPARES THE KIMCHI

900
00:39:55,976 --> 00:39:56,811
-Kimchi?
-Yeah.

901
00:39:57,436 --> 00:39:59,605
Let's tell them
to fill their trays by themselves.

902
00:39:59,688 --> 00:40:01,023
Everyone, take a tray…

903
00:40:01,107 --> 00:40:02,358
KIAN'S B&B RULES
SERVE YOURSELF

904
00:40:02,441 --> 00:40:04,485
And help yourselves.

905
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:05,861
Wow, this looks great.

906
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:08,239
Anyone need a spoon?

907
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:09,573
Everyone has one?

908
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:11,117
Can I get a spoon?

909
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:14,328
This was used to just stir the stew.

910
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:15,871
That's okay.

911
00:40:16,747 --> 00:40:18,707
-Enjoy.
-You don't have a spoon.

912
00:40:18,791 --> 00:40:20,167
I'm fine with just chopsticks.

913
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:21,460
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

914
00:40:22,169 --> 00:40:23,254
-Ye-eun.
-Yes?

915
00:40:23,337 --> 00:40:24,255
Well done.

916
00:40:24,338 --> 00:40:25,214
Thank you.

917
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:27,675
Thanks, Jin.

918
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:29,093
The stew looks great.

919
00:40:29,176 --> 00:40:31,137
-It's not bad.
-Yeah.

920
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:33,597
-It came out really well.
-Really? It looks delicious.

921
00:40:34,557 --> 00:40:35,599
Enjoy your meal!

922
00:40:35,683 --> 00:40:36,934
9.30 P.M.
DINNER

923
00:40:37,017 --> 00:40:38,394
Thank you for the meal.

924
00:40:38,477 --> 00:40:39,854
By the way, everyone,

925
00:40:39,937 --> 00:40:41,647
things will go a lot smoother tomorrow.

926
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:44,567
We apologize. Tomorrow, we'll buy
all the stuff we're short on.

927
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:48,112
We're short on cups,
so please share if you're with friends.

928
00:40:48,195 --> 00:40:49,029
Okay.

929
00:40:49,697 --> 00:40:50,906
We're out of cups,

930
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:52,241
so we'll pour the drinks.

931
00:40:52,324 --> 00:40:53,325
Okay.

932
00:40:53,409 --> 00:40:55,369
For those drinking from the bottle,

933
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:58,706
if your neighbor is out,
pour them a drink as you drink too.

934
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:08,007
Want some?

935
00:41:09,008 --> 00:41:10,009
The stew's really good.

936
00:41:15,931 --> 00:41:16,932
It's really good.

937
00:41:17,016 --> 00:41:18,350
Yeah, it is good.

938
00:41:18,434 --> 00:41:19,602
Really good.

939
00:41:38,954 --> 00:41:39,830
Ye-eun, try this.

940
00:41:40,456 --> 00:41:42,166
Gosh, thank you.

941
00:41:42,249 --> 00:41:43,751
The stew's really good.

942
00:41:43,834 --> 00:41:45,085
Really?

943
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:46,212
THE OWNER IS PROUD

944
00:41:46,295 --> 00:41:48,714
-A stew made by BTS.
-BTS soybean paste stew.

945
00:41:48,797 --> 00:41:50,341
This BTS soybean paste stew.

946
00:41:53,427 --> 00:41:54,512
This is seriously good.

947
00:41:54,595 --> 00:41:55,596
-Really?
-Yeah.

948
00:42:01,393 --> 00:42:03,062
You don't have any chopsticks.

949
00:42:05,231 --> 00:42:06,732
I don't have a spoon.

950
00:42:09,026 --> 00:42:10,236
And our boss has neither.

951
00:42:12,696 --> 00:42:14,198
That piece of kimchi was huge.

952
00:42:14,281 --> 00:42:16,075
THE OWNER HAS HIS HANDS

953
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:23,791
WIPES HANDS ON HIS LEGS

954
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:26,085
Use this to wipe your hands!

955
00:42:27,795 --> 00:42:29,338
This reminds me of my time in India.

956
00:42:29,421 --> 00:42:30,506
WIPING HANDS ON HIS CLOTHES

957
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:33,133
Use this.

958
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:36,637
My friends from India come to mind.

959
00:42:38,013 --> 00:42:40,015
The stew's seriously good.

960
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:41,267
-It's good.
-It's the best.

961
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:42,309
I'm glad.

962
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:43,811
How can you be good at cooking too?

963
00:42:43,894 --> 00:42:44,895
Right?

964
00:42:44,979 --> 00:42:46,647
What can't you do?

965
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:48,107
Seriously!

966
00:42:49,942 --> 00:42:53,946
Before you go to bed,
I'll go downstairs and pass them up.

967
00:42:54,029 --> 00:42:54,989
The blankets.

968
00:42:55,614 --> 00:42:56,448
Yeah.

969
00:42:56,532 --> 00:42:59,034
If it's too cold
or scary to sleep outside,

970
00:42:59,118 --> 00:43:00,369
you can sleep downstairs.

971
00:43:00,452 --> 00:43:01,662
Yeah.

972
00:43:01,745 --> 00:43:03,247
Why have you gone soft, Boss?

973
00:43:03,956 --> 00:43:04,915
No, I just…

974
00:43:05,666 --> 00:43:07,668
I need to think things over tonight.

975
00:43:10,045 --> 00:43:12,965
You seem to be having
a hard time with running a B&B.

976
00:43:13,549 --> 00:43:14,967
I am.

977
00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:17,511
You learn through trial and error.

978
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:21,098
Maybe I designed it this way
to purposely go through trial and error.

979
00:43:21,682 --> 00:43:24,018
-But we'll never be able to forget this.
-Never.

980
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:25,311
We'll never forget this.

981
00:43:25,394 --> 00:43:27,396
It's like I'm on a college retreat,
so it's nice.

982
00:43:27,479 --> 00:43:29,315
I think I'll remember this for a while.

983
00:43:35,195 --> 00:43:36,363
Who's leaving tomorrow?

984
00:43:38,324 --> 00:43:39,283
Just you?

985
00:43:39,366 --> 00:43:40,576
-Both of them.
-Both of you?

986
00:43:40,659 --> 00:43:42,036
-Both of them.
-Both of you?

987
00:43:43,871 --> 00:43:45,164
You're leaving tomorrow?

988
00:43:45,247 --> 00:43:47,291
But why tomorrow?

989
00:43:47,374 --> 00:43:48,834
My trip was for three days.

990
00:43:49,585 --> 00:43:50,878
What a shame.

991
00:43:50,961 --> 00:43:52,880
It feels like
they've been here for a while.

992
00:43:52,963 --> 00:43:54,548
Because they were our first guests.

993
00:43:55,132 --> 00:43:56,216
Our first guests.

994
00:43:57,718 --> 00:43:58,552
I feel sad.

995
00:43:59,261 --> 00:44:00,095
We still…

996
00:44:00,804 --> 00:44:02,514
don't know anything about you two.

997
00:44:02,598 --> 00:44:03,807
Exactly.

998
00:44:03,891 --> 00:44:06,101
Should I stay another day?
Do you have any beds left?

999
00:44:06,185 --> 00:44:07,227
Are there guests tomorrow?

1000
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:08,812
I don't know how many are coming.

1001
00:44:12,608 --> 00:44:14,818
You're hair's blowing
like a comic book character's.

1002
00:44:14,902 --> 00:44:16,904
-I know. He's handsome.
-In a dreamy way.

1003
00:44:16,987 --> 00:44:20,115
Your look makes me want to draw you
as a web comic character.

1004
00:44:20,783 --> 00:44:22,868
Your hair's blowing
like a male protagonist's.

1005
00:44:22,951 --> 00:44:25,120
-It is.
-How annoying.

1006
00:44:25,913 --> 00:44:27,247
He's handsome.

1007
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:28,957
The three of us are a team.

1008
00:44:29,041 --> 00:44:30,959
-Really?
-We're a climbing team.

1009
00:44:31,043 --> 00:44:32,294
How old are you guys?

1010
00:44:32,378 --> 00:44:33,671
I was born in 1998.

1011
00:44:33,754 --> 00:44:35,381
-I'm 27.
-Gosh.

1012
00:44:35,464 --> 00:44:36,757
I was born in 1990.

1013
00:44:37,466 --> 00:44:40,219
In 1990? He's older than me.
The only guest who's older.

1014
00:44:40,302 --> 00:44:41,470
The only older guest.

1015
00:44:41,553 --> 00:44:42,388
How old are you?

1016
00:44:43,013 --> 00:44:43,972
I was born in 1992.

1017
00:44:44,056 --> 00:44:45,933
Hey, we're the same age. My friend!

1018
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:47,434
We're the same age.

1019
00:44:47,518 --> 00:44:49,812
-Nice to meet you, my friend.
-What are the chances?

1020
00:44:49,895 --> 00:44:50,729
Paris Saint-Germain.

1021
00:44:50,813 --> 00:44:52,898
-You haven't graduated yet?
-I'm still in school.

1022
00:44:52,981 --> 00:44:56,693
I am a carpenter,
but I'm currently studying architecture.

1023
00:44:56,777 --> 00:44:59,446
I started working on sites
when I was 18 years old.

1024
00:45:00,155 --> 00:45:01,573
And this year,

1025
00:45:01,657 --> 00:45:03,951
I felt I needed to learn more,
so I enrolled in college.

1026
00:45:04,034 --> 00:45:04,910
That's so cool.

1027
00:45:04,993 --> 00:45:07,371
-Are you studying abroad?
-Yes, in Australia.

1028
00:45:07,454 --> 00:45:08,288
You do, don't you?

1029
00:45:08,372 --> 00:45:09,498
-How did you know?
-She had…

1030
00:45:09,581 --> 00:45:10,958
-This foreign carpenter vibe.
-Yes.

1031
00:45:11,041 --> 00:45:12,251
-It's how she talks.
-Right.

1032
00:45:12,334 --> 00:45:13,544
-You can tell.
-Right?

1033
00:45:13,627 --> 00:45:14,586
You're right.

1034
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:16,296
If she was a carpenter in Korea,

1035
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:17,881
we'd say, "We're out of gigs today."

1036
00:45:17,965 --> 00:45:18,966
What?

1037
00:45:19,049 --> 00:45:19,967
-Right?
-Right.

1038
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:22,261
I used to work on construction sites
when I was young.

1039
00:45:22,344 --> 00:45:23,178
I see.

1040
00:45:23,262 --> 00:45:24,847
I was born in 1992.

1041
00:45:24,930 --> 00:45:26,765
As a hobby, I perform as a singer.

1042
00:45:26,849 --> 00:45:28,434
-"Hobby."
-"Hobby"?

1043
00:45:28,517 --> 00:45:29,435
My day job is…

1044
00:45:30,185 --> 00:45:31,353
at the B&B…

1045
00:45:31,437 --> 00:45:32,479
Yeah.

1046
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:34,314
I'm the manager here.

1047
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:35,732
As for my work experience,

1048
00:45:36,275 --> 00:45:39,111
there isn't much,
but I've won Billboard Music Awards.

1049
00:45:39,194 --> 00:45:40,446
My goodness!

1050
00:45:41,488 --> 00:45:43,323
-My goodness!
-That's fire!

1051
00:45:44,992 --> 00:45:46,201
That's crazy.

1052
00:45:46,285 --> 00:45:48,412
-He's won Billboard Music Awards.
-That's incredible.

1053
00:45:48,495 --> 00:45:51,165
I've also won a few grand prizes
at Korean music awards.

1054
00:45:51,748 --> 00:45:54,460
He won those
even though it's only a hobby for him.

1055
00:45:55,169 --> 00:45:58,088
We were also nominated for the Grammys
but sadly didn't win anything.

1056
00:45:58,797 --> 00:46:01,967
I plan to work harder so we can try again.

1057
00:46:02,050 --> 00:46:02,968
I'm so jealous.

1058
00:46:03,677 --> 00:46:05,179
Our next global star.

1059
00:46:05,804 --> 00:46:07,723
Let's have Ye-eun introduce herself.

1060
00:46:07,806 --> 00:46:08,891
You can drive boats.

1061
00:46:08,974 --> 00:46:10,851
-Boats…
-Right, boats.

1062
00:46:10,934 --> 00:46:13,020
-The best driver.
-She's a captain.

1063
00:46:13,103 --> 00:46:14,188
Captain Ji.

1064
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:15,272
I'm Ye-eun94.

1065
00:46:15,355 --> 00:46:16,732
Not Kian84. Ye-eun94.

1066
00:46:18,442 --> 00:46:20,027
I'm 41 years old.

1067
00:46:20,611 --> 00:46:23,155
And I'm the owner of your B&B.

1068
00:46:23,864 --> 00:46:25,741
I'm sorry for serving your dinner so late.

1069
00:46:26,783 --> 00:46:28,535
I'm sorry for making
the B&B so strange too.

1070
00:46:30,662 --> 00:46:31,830
It's so nice to meet you all.

1071
00:46:33,081 --> 00:46:34,374
Yes, that's all.

1072
00:46:34,458 --> 00:46:36,418
I'm slowly starting to slur my words.

1073
00:46:38,295 --> 00:46:40,255
I think it'd be fun
to play Mafia with everyone.

1074
00:46:40,339 --> 00:46:41,298
I like that idea.

1075
00:46:41,381 --> 00:46:42,591
-I'm good at it.
-Sounds fun.

1076
00:46:42,674 --> 00:46:44,092
It'd be fun with this many.

1077
00:46:45,677 --> 00:46:47,221
Then, I'll be the moderator.

1078
00:46:47,304 --> 00:46:48,639
Shall we play a round of Mafia?

1079
00:46:48,722 --> 00:46:50,140
It's been a while. I want to play.

1080
00:46:50,224 --> 00:46:51,850
I'll use my mind-reading ability.

1081
00:46:51,934 --> 00:46:55,062
Okay, everyone! Put your heads down.
Start pounding the ground.

1082
00:46:55,145 --> 00:46:58,565
If you don't pound properly,
I won't continue with the game.

1083
00:46:58,649 --> 00:47:01,527
If you don't pound properly
with your palms…

1084
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:03,445
ENTHUSIASTIC MODERATOR,
PALMS ON FIRE

1085
00:47:03,529 --> 00:47:04,905
I won't continue with the game.

1086
00:47:04,988 --> 00:47:06,281
Ki-hong, hit the ground harder!

1087
00:47:06,865 --> 00:47:09,076
Okay, I will now select the mafia.

1088
00:47:09,159 --> 00:47:11,495
I don't know who it will be yet.

1089
00:47:11,954 --> 00:47:13,997
THE MODERATOR HAS CHOSEN
YE-EUN AS THE MAFIA

1090
00:47:14,081 --> 00:47:16,667
Hello, I'm Ye-eun, and I'm a civilian.

1091
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:17,668
YE-EUN IS THE MAFIA

1092
00:47:17,751 --> 00:47:19,878
My mind reading ability has spoken to me.

1093
00:47:20,837 --> 00:47:21,713
It's you.

1094
00:47:21,797 --> 00:47:22,923
It's not time to choose yet.

1095
00:47:23,006 --> 00:47:23,924
HE CHOSE A CIVILIAN

1096
00:47:24,424 --> 00:47:26,093
HIS MIND READING HELPS YE-EUN

1097
00:47:26,176 --> 00:47:27,427
That is hilarious.

1098
00:47:27,511 --> 00:47:29,680
My mind reading ability
has been activated.

1099
00:47:29,763 --> 00:47:31,598
-What does it say?
-He's the mafia.

1100
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:33,141
ME?

1101
00:47:34,768 --> 00:47:35,769
She's the mafia.

1102
00:47:35,852 --> 00:47:36,687
NOPE

1103
00:47:36,770 --> 00:47:37,938
They're the mafia!

1104
00:47:38,272 --> 00:47:39,773
NOPE

1105
00:47:39,856 --> 00:47:41,066
Just an utter…

1106
00:47:41,149 --> 00:47:42,192
This is driving me nuts!

1107
00:47:42,985 --> 00:47:44,528
I finally know now.

1108
00:47:44,611 --> 00:47:45,862
My mind reading ability…

1109
00:47:47,155 --> 00:47:49,241
has revealed that you are clean.

1110
00:47:49,324 --> 00:47:50,951
You're spot on with that.

1111
00:47:51,034 --> 00:47:53,745
With my ability,
I can read everyone's mind!

1112
00:47:53,829 --> 00:47:55,914
NOPE

1113
00:47:55,998 --> 00:47:56,957
Okay!

1114
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:57,958
My goodness!

1115
00:47:58,041 --> 00:47:59,001
But!

1116
00:47:59,084 --> 00:48:01,044
THE EVER-ENTHUSIASTIC MODERATOR,
STARTLED

1117
00:48:01,128 --> 00:48:02,170
But?

1118
00:48:02,254 --> 00:48:03,338
At this point…

1119
00:48:03,422 --> 00:48:04,673
-Thumbs up for guilty.
-I swear.

1120
00:48:04,756 --> 00:48:06,258
Down for innocent. Cast your votes.

1121
00:48:06,341 --> 00:48:08,510
-One, two, three!
-This is so frustrating.

1122
00:48:08,594 --> 00:48:09,553
YE-EUN IS INNOCENT

1123
00:48:09,636 --> 00:48:11,096
I'm telling you I'm not.

1124
00:48:11,179 --> 00:48:12,014
It's not me.

1125
00:48:12,097 --> 00:48:13,640
YE-EUN IS GUILTY

1126
00:48:13,724 --> 00:48:15,642
Unfortunately, the mafia…

1127
00:48:16,893 --> 00:48:18,729
has been killed.

1128
00:48:18,812 --> 00:48:19,730
We were right.

1129
00:48:20,939 --> 00:48:21,898
You were the mafia?

1130
00:48:21,982 --> 00:48:23,191
-Yes.
-Okay…

1131
00:48:27,946 --> 00:48:29,615
I swear my mind reading was right.

1132
00:48:29,698 --> 00:48:30,532
Darn.

1133
00:48:30,616 --> 00:48:33,201
-Everyone, did you enjoy the game?
-Yes.

1134
00:48:33,285 --> 00:48:34,745
-You were good.
-It was great acting.

1135
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:36,622
MAFIA AT KIAN'S B&B IS OVER

1136
00:48:36,705 --> 00:48:37,914
Mafia, seriously…

1137
00:48:38,957 --> 00:48:40,125
Shall I climb up?

1138
00:48:40,208 --> 00:48:41,710
No, I'll go inside.

1139
00:48:42,502 --> 00:48:43,920
-Impressive.
-Damn it.

1140
00:48:44,546 --> 00:48:47,174
CLIMBING ONCE AGAIN

1141
00:48:47,257 --> 00:48:49,009
I'll go inside and take them in.

1142
00:48:49,092 --> 00:48:50,719
Then, let's go in together.

1143
00:48:50,802 --> 00:48:51,928
I'll take them in.

1144
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:54,723
By the way,

1145
00:48:55,932 --> 00:48:58,602
is it illegal to climb after drinking?

1146
00:48:58,685 --> 00:49:00,437
I doubt it would be well-received.

1147
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:01,438
-Right?
-Yes.

1148
00:49:01,521 --> 00:49:02,356
In that case…

1149
00:49:02,439 --> 00:49:03,273
SENSING BACKLASH

1150
00:49:03,357 --> 00:49:05,192
Since I drank, I should go the other way.

1151
00:49:05,442 --> 00:49:09,571
LET'S BE MINDFUL

1152
00:49:21,667 --> 00:49:23,168
This should go in the fridge.

1153
00:49:25,712 --> 00:49:27,756
THE ENTIRE TRAY GOES
INTO THE FRIDGE

1154
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:29,257
-Tomorrow, we will…
-Boss!

1155
00:49:29,341 --> 00:49:31,593
-Yes?
-Use the colander there.

1156
00:49:31,677 --> 00:49:33,011
Put it over the sink.

1157
00:49:33,095 --> 00:49:35,138
-And pour the food waste into it.
-Okay.

1158
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:38,517
FOLLOWING ORDERS
FROM HIS WORLD-CLASS ANCHOR

1159
00:49:44,856 --> 00:49:47,734
CHECKS THE MIRROR
BEFORE WASHING THE DISHES

1160
00:49:49,569 --> 00:49:51,363
EVEN WASHES HIS FACE

1161
00:49:54,157 --> 00:49:56,159
DRIPPING WITH WATER

1162
00:49:56,451 --> 00:49:59,329
STARTS WASHING DISHES WITH A WET FACE

1163
00:50:01,039 --> 00:50:02,124
Boss!

1164
00:50:02,791 --> 00:50:05,001
-Yeah?
-I'll go shower first.

1165
00:50:05,085 --> 00:50:06,753
-Go ahead.
-Okay.

1166
00:50:08,547 --> 00:50:13,593
JIN GOES TO SHOWER
AFTER WORKING HARD TO COOK

1167
00:50:15,011 --> 00:50:16,596
-In that case…
-Yes?

1168
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:19,766
Could you take these blankets…

1169
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:21,184
Hey, friend!

1170
00:50:21,268 --> 00:50:22,644
-Yes?
-Sir?

1171
00:50:22,728 --> 00:50:24,521
We're going to lift up bedding.

1172
00:50:24,604 --> 00:50:26,106
-Could you take them?
-Sure.

1173
00:50:27,149 --> 00:50:29,484
EXPRESS DELIVERY

1174
00:50:36,616 --> 00:50:37,534
That looks fun.

1175
00:50:38,368 --> 00:50:39,286
Would you like to try?

1176
00:50:39,369 --> 00:50:40,454
I don't think I can.

1177
00:50:40,537 --> 00:50:41,371
SCARED

1178
00:50:41,455 --> 00:50:42,456
What about the blankets?

1179
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:46,626
Why are there so many?

1180
00:50:47,627 --> 00:50:48,545
There's so much.

1181
00:50:48,628 --> 00:50:50,338
All done.

1182
00:50:51,506 --> 00:50:54,176
THE OWNER IS DONE
WASHING DISHES TOO

1183
00:50:55,385 --> 00:50:59,514
KIAN'S B&B MOVES BEHIND THE BREAKWATER

1184
00:50:59,598 --> 00:51:01,016
If you look at the beds,

1185
00:51:01,975 --> 00:51:02,893
this spot…

1186
00:51:02,976 --> 00:51:05,395
-This one is mine.
-Okay.

1187
00:51:05,479 --> 00:51:06,772
-And…
-And this one.

1188
00:51:06,855 --> 00:51:08,190
-Here.
-Okay.

1189
00:51:08,273 --> 00:51:09,316
The bottom bunk.

1190
00:51:09,399 --> 00:51:12,235
The bottom bunk is Jin's bed.

1191
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:14,237
-Only two beds are taken?
-Yes, just two.

1192
00:51:14,321 --> 00:51:16,990
There are 12 people and 11 beds.

1193
00:51:17,616 --> 00:51:21,286
One of our employees
will be sleeping downstairs in a tent.

1194
00:51:21,369 --> 00:51:23,163
How should we pick our beds?

1195
00:51:23,246 --> 00:51:26,458
The bottom bunks can only be reached
by going down the ladders.

1196
00:51:26,541 --> 00:51:29,169
Yes, so they said
if the person above sleeps first,

1197
00:51:29,252 --> 00:51:31,254
you have to climb over them.

1198
00:51:31,338 --> 00:51:32,756
You can just climb up from below.

1199
00:51:32,839 --> 00:51:34,466
Wait, is that possible for me?

1200
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:35,759
JUN-HEE TRIES TO ENTER

1201
00:51:35,842 --> 00:51:37,928
That's it! Get up!

1202
00:51:38,011 --> 00:51:39,304
-Hold on.
-Just lift yourself up.

1203
00:51:39,387 --> 00:51:40,472
That's it.

1204
00:51:41,389 --> 00:51:42,557
That's it.

1205
00:51:43,308 --> 00:51:44,935
Okay, you can go straight to sleep now.

1206
00:51:45,519 --> 00:51:46,436
Okay. It's decided.

1207
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:47,521
I can't do it!

1208
00:51:47,604 --> 00:51:48,814
She decided by herself.

1209
00:51:54,444 --> 00:51:58,406
KI-HONG FROM TEAM KAIST
TAKES A TOP BUNK

1210
00:51:59,407 --> 00:52:02,494
SEONG-EUN FROM TEAM KAIST
IS HOPING FOR A BOTTOM BUNK

1211
00:52:03,411 --> 00:52:06,248
DANGLING

1212
00:52:07,833 --> 00:52:09,751
SIGHS

1213
00:52:12,629 --> 00:52:16,508
SUCCESSFULLY ENTERS

1214
00:52:17,843 --> 00:52:21,096
MIN-JUN FROM THE CLIMBING TEAM
TAKES A MIDDLE BUNK

1215
00:52:23,223 --> 00:52:24,349
Good night.

1216
00:52:24,432 --> 00:52:25,809
You don't need a pillow?

1217
00:52:25,892 --> 00:52:27,602
A pillow? One would be nice.

1218
00:52:27,686 --> 00:52:29,312
-Would you like one?
-Is there a spare?

1219
00:52:29,396 --> 00:52:30,313
Yes, here.

1220
00:52:31,189 --> 00:52:32,399
Wow, thank you.

1221
00:52:32,482 --> 00:52:33,441
I have a blanket too.

1222
00:52:33,525 --> 00:52:36,152
You can cover your stomach
if it gets cold at the night.

1223
00:52:36,236 --> 00:52:38,655
-Thank you so much.
-They're right next to me.

1224
00:52:39,823 --> 00:52:41,199
Thank you.

1225
00:52:47,539 --> 00:52:48,790
Are you going to sleep now?

1226
00:52:48,874 --> 00:52:51,668
I'm just going to lie down here. Yeah.

1227
00:53:01,052 --> 00:53:05,265
THE OWNER FASTENS KI-HONG'S BELT

1228
00:53:05,891 --> 00:53:07,309
Wear your belts before you sleep.

1229
00:53:08,476 --> 00:53:10,145
Yeah. Put these belts on.

1230
00:53:10,228 --> 00:53:11,438
-Okay.
-It's so you don't fall.

1231
00:53:11,521 --> 00:53:12,355
Thank you.

1232
00:53:13,356 --> 00:53:15,984
-Everyone, sleep with your belts on.
-Okay.

1233
00:53:16,610 --> 00:53:17,527
If you don't,

1234
00:53:18,486 --> 00:53:19,321
that won't do.

1235
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:26,661
Hello there.

1236
00:53:26,745 --> 00:53:27,787
I have my belt on.

1237
00:53:29,497 --> 00:53:31,041
This reminds me of the train in India.

1238
00:53:36,171 --> 00:53:38,590
Sleep with your belt on. Make sure.

1239
00:53:38,673 --> 00:53:40,300
We can't have you get hurt.

1240
00:53:43,386 --> 00:53:47,390
When I was drawing this,
it was really idyllic and romantic.

1241
00:53:48,975 --> 00:53:50,185
But now that it's built,

1242
00:53:51,436 --> 00:53:54,522
why does it feel like that goes
hand in hand with danger?

1243
00:53:56,358 --> 00:53:59,235
I only thought of how idyllic it would be,

1244
00:53:59,319 --> 00:54:00,779
but after really being here,

1245
00:54:01,905 --> 00:54:03,615
there are so many things to worry about.

1246
00:54:04,532 --> 00:54:05,951
Are you worried about tomorrow?

1247
00:54:06,534 --> 00:54:07,702
I am.

1248
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:15,251
I was thinking too much
in terms of comics.

1249
00:54:16,294 --> 00:54:18,630
It was fun to imagine things,

1250
00:54:19,464 --> 00:54:21,424
but the problem was

1251
00:54:21,508 --> 00:54:23,760
whether they would feel
the same way about it.

1252
00:54:24,803 --> 00:54:26,680
That was my biggest worry.

1253
00:54:26,763 --> 00:54:30,892
The experience could end up being
anything but idyllic and romantic.

1254
00:54:33,311 --> 00:54:34,854
Boss, you're not going to shower?

1255
00:54:35,814 --> 00:54:36,690
I'm fine.

1256
00:54:38,149 --> 00:54:42,404
I WASHED UP EARLIER

1257
00:54:49,035 --> 00:54:51,204
TOSSES THE BLANKET AND PILLOW DOWN FIRST

1258
00:54:59,421 --> 00:55:01,339
Boss, are you sure this is right?

1259
00:55:03,925 --> 00:55:05,760
Where should I put my head?

1260
00:55:05,844 --> 00:55:08,054
Sleep away from the cabinet.

1261
00:55:08,138 --> 00:55:10,807
-You might end up hitting your head.
-You're right.

1262
00:55:16,521 --> 00:55:17,355
What on earth?

1263
00:55:19,733 --> 00:55:21,151
Good night.

1264
00:55:37,417 --> 00:55:38,835
Good night.

1265
00:55:53,641 --> 00:55:58,396
YE-EUN TAKES A CORNER
ON THE SECOND FLOOR INSTEAD OF A TENT

1266
00:55:59,647 --> 00:56:01,608
MEANWHILE, THE GUESTS
WHO CAN'T FALL ASLEEP

1267
00:56:01,691 --> 00:56:03,276
That's so cool! You see that?

1268
00:56:03,359 --> 00:56:04,778
The Seven Sisters.

1269
00:56:04,861 --> 00:56:06,613
Messier 45, the Pleiades star cluster.

1270
00:56:06,696 --> 00:56:07,614
That's crazy.

1271
00:56:07,697 --> 00:56:09,199
There seems to be a lot.

1272
00:56:09,282 --> 00:56:10,366
Want to go down for a look?

1273
00:56:10,450 --> 00:56:13,078
-Is that Cassiopeia? It's not, right?
-It is.

1274
00:56:13,161 --> 00:56:14,245
-Really?
-Yeah, it is.

1275
00:56:14,329 --> 00:56:15,622
It's that big?

1276
00:56:15,705 --> 00:56:17,040
And then, look over there.

1277
00:56:17,123 --> 00:56:18,958
One, two, three, four, five,

1278
00:56:19,918 --> 00:56:21,086
six…

1279
00:56:21,169 --> 00:56:22,087
seven.

1280
00:56:22,962 --> 00:56:24,714
You can see all seven stars
in the Pleiades.

1281
00:56:27,258 --> 00:56:29,594
I haven't felt like this in a while.

1282
00:56:29,677 --> 00:56:31,179
It's practically a first for me.

1283
00:56:31,262 --> 00:56:33,890
Why did you like constellations?

1284
00:56:35,475 --> 00:56:37,268
It started from dreams.

1285
00:56:37,352 --> 00:56:39,145
We're overdosing on dreams right now.

1286
00:56:39,229 --> 00:56:40,146
I know.

1287
00:56:40,939 --> 00:56:43,399
It'd be nice if Kian could come
and see this with us.

1288
00:56:44,734 --> 00:56:45,944
They all arrived today.

1289
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:49,656
Time really flies.
It disappears instantly.

1290
00:56:49,739 --> 00:56:50,782
-Right.
-We didn't do much.

1291
00:56:51,616 --> 00:56:52,617
It's a shame.

1292
00:56:53,118 --> 00:56:54,994
I can't believe
our ferry ride wasn't canceled.

1293
00:56:55,078 --> 00:56:56,204
I wish it was.

1294
00:56:56,955 --> 00:56:58,873
I want to see bit more of Ulleungdo.

1295
00:56:58,957 --> 00:57:00,166
Want to see the sunrise?

1296
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:01,835
Let me see what time it will be.

1297
00:57:01,918 --> 00:57:02,919
Look up the sunrise time.

1298
00:57:03,002 --> 00:57:04,337
-Yeah, I'll look it up.
-Okay.

1299
00:57:11,469 --> 00:57:13,847
4:00 A.M.

1300
00:57:22,188 --> 00:57:23,189
It's raining.

1301
00:57:30,321 --> 00:57:31,156
It's raining.

1302
00:57:33,491 --> 00:57:34,325
The rain.

1303
00:57:38,413 --> 00:57:39,247
It's cold!

1304
00:57:40,081 --> 00:57:41,082
We're not going in?

1305
00:57:44,252 --> 00:57:45,086
Hold on.

1306
00:57:46,004 --> 00:57:47,672
Gosh, it's raining so much.

1307
00:57:48,339 --> 00:57:49,382
Boss.

1308
00:57:52,844 --> 00:57:53,678
Boss!

1309
00:57:54,721 --> 00:57:55,555
Are you okay?

1310
00:57:55,638 --> 00:57:57,640
KIAN'S BIZARRE B&B

1311
00:58:53,613 --> 00:58:55,615
