1
00:00:18,309 --> 00:00:22,564
DAY 4

2
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:40,498
-Did you sleep well?
-Yes.

3
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:42,584
Where did the kids sleep last night?

4
00:00:42,667 --> 00:00:43,585
The kids?

5
00:00:44,252 --> 00:00:45,336
Where was it again?

6
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:49,758
-They bumped into something in the car.
-Right.

7
00:00:49,841 --> 00:00:51,301
A CAR ACCIDENT?

8
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:54,721
-Nobody got hurt,
-Okay.

9
00:00:54,804 --> 00:00:56,097
but the kids were shaken.

10
00:00:57,807 --> 00:00:59,768
So they spent the night somewhere else.

11
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:02,604
CONCERNED

12
00:01:02,687 --> 00:01:08,068
WHERE THE HA FAMILY STAYED LAST NIGHT

13
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:10,612
Jeez, I freaked out when I heard the news.

14
00:01:10,695 --> 00:01:12,322
I know. I was shocked too.

15
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:14,365
The kids must've been scared.

16
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:18,745
WORRIED

17
00:01:18,828 --> 00:01:21,998
-I'm going to pick them up right now.
-Okay.

18
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:37,388
Yes?

19
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:39,766
Mr. Ha, are you all right?

20
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:41,309
It's unfortunate what happened.

21
00:01:41,392 --> 00:01:42,602
-Can I come in?
-Yes.

22
00:01:42,685 --> 00:01:44,187
-Oh, thank you.
-Come in.

23
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:46,272
-Dam, are you okay?
-Yes.

24
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:47,857
You didn't get hurt?

25
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:49,692
-Do you feel okay now?
-Yes.

26
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:50,944
-You didn't get hurt?
-No.

27
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:55,031
-They got spooked by the accident
-Right.

28
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:58,368
-but they're fine otherwise.
-I see.

29
00:01:58,451 --> 00:02:03,540
-Are you ready to go back to the B&B?
-Yes.

30
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:04,958
What about you, buddy?

31
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:07,127
Do you think you can go climbing again?

32
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:09,587
YES, I DO

33
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:11,089
Shall we go to the boat then?

34
00:02:11,172 --> 00:02:13,675
-Are you ready, sir?
-Yes.

35
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:17,929
-Did you catch any bugs, buddy?
-No.

36
00:02:18,012 --> 00:02:19,305
Not even a single one?

37
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:21,933
-We caught a grasshopper,
-You caught a grasshopper?

38
00:02:22,016 --> 00:02:23,643
-but on the way here--
-Did it escape?

39
00:02:23,726 --> 00:02:26,020
We dropped it somewhere
during the accident.

40
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:28,356
Darn, we could've had fried grasshoppers.

41
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:33,403
Back in my day,
I used to catch frogs and eat them.

42
00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:35,113
Cover your ears.

43
00:02:37,198 --> 00:02:39,200
Let's catch another one at Kian's B&B.

44
00:02:42,078 --> 00:02:44,706
-I used to eat grasshoppers!
-Uncle Jin is acting weird.

45
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:46,708
That's what we did back in my day.

46
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:50,420
-Hey, the kids are here.
-Aren't you curious?

47
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:52,630
-Hi.
-Hello.

48
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:55,174
-Are the kids okay?
-Yes, they're fine.

49
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:56,175
-Are you good?
-Yes.

50
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:58,553
RELIEVED

51
00:03:00,054 --> 00:03:01,306
I was worried about them.

52
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:09,022
-We have to go now.
-What time?

53
00:03:09,105 --> 00:03:11,441
-As soon as possible.
-Oh, really?

54
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:15,486
CAPTAIN JI RUSHES

55
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:17,280
Let's go.

56
00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:23,620
Gather up now.

57
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:26,664
9 A.M.
CLIMBING TEAM HEADS OUT

58
00:03:27,248 --> 00:03:28,875
-Have a good time.
-Okay.

59
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:30,835
-See you later.
-Good luck.

60
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:32,086
Hope we can do it today.

61
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:33,963
-We have to succeed.
-You will today.

62
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:36,049
-We'll see you later.
-See you.

63
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:39,802
AS CAPTAIN JI RETURNS

64
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:44,599
THE OWNER BRUSHES HIS TEETH

65
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:58,071
4 MINUTES LATER

66
00:04:06,996 --> 00:04:08,039
TOSSES

67
00:04:19,008 --> 00:04:21,135
FLINGS

68
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:25,974
I only have one outfit,
so I wash it during my morning shower.

69
00:04:27,183 --> 00:04:29,769
Quick as a flash, I'm done in one go.

70
00:04:29,852 --> 00:04:30,895
Why?

71
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:33,273
DRY IN THE SUN

72
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:36,401
Sunlight is a natural disinfectant,
so they get clean.

73
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:44,075
HE'S PUTTING IT ON ALREADY?

74
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:12,562
AFTER STRUGGLING TO PUT ON HIS WET SHIRT

75
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:17,608
HE WEARS HIS JACKET

76
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:22,363
KIAN-STYLE SHOWER AND LAUNDRY IS NOW OVER

77
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:25,950
-I'll get started on building benches.
-Okay.

78
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:28,328
BENCHES?

79
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:31,497
THEY SAT ON THE GROUND
TO EAT DINNER ON DAY 2

80
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:34,125
We have bench-making materials.

81
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:36,627
AH-JIN WANTS TO MAKE A BENCH FOR THEM

82
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:38,671
That's a good idea.

83
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:42,842
-Do you need help with anything?
-I need help putting this together.

84
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:45,428
-Put what together?
-Position this first and…

85
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:46,888
SHE DEMONSTRATES

86
00:05:46,971 --> 00:05:49,348
-What's this?
-Once it goes in, press down here.

87
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:52,810
This drilling sound means it's in.

88
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:54,437
Do you want to try it out?

89
00:05:55,938 --> 00:05:57,690
TRIES IT IMMEDIATELY

90
00:06:08,242 --> 00:06:10,119
This is perfect.
I'm impressed with myself.

91
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:11,454
You did a great job.

92
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:13,706
You picked that up very quickly.

93
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:16,584
I don't do well when I get compliments,
so don't compliment me.

94
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:18,795
This looks pretty bad. Try a bit harder.

95
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:22,840
-What a hurtful thing to say.
-You can't take compliments, so…

96
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:24,926
That doesn't mean I want criticism.

97
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:27,804
That's it.

98
00:06:29,263 --> 00:06:30,640
That's great.

99
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:39,023
All done.

100
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:40,733
-It's already done?
-Yes.

101
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:42,151
Thank you.

102
00:06:43,277 --> 00:06:46,739
-You made these in no time.
-It's nice to sit here.

103
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:47,782
BENCHES COMPLETE

104
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:50,159
Do you know what I do for a living?

105
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:54,914
Yul, do you know what I do for a living?

106
00:06:54,997 --> 00:06:56,374
Kian84…

107
00:06:56,457 --> 00:06:58,835
-He says you're Kian84.
-He said that?

108
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:00,628
Me?

109
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:03,631
SHOCKED

110
00:07:03,714 --> 00:07:08,010
Well, have you heard
of a group called BTS?

111
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:09,637
NODS

112
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:13,224
I'm the oldest member of BTS.

113
00:07:13,307 --> 00:07:15,059
And this guy here is called Kian84.

114
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:19,397
I'm Kian84, and I draw webtoons.

115
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,524
Just imagining made me happy briefly.

116
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:23,025
When can we expect a new series?

117
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:24,402
-A new series?
-Yes.

118
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:26,654
I don't plan on drawing webtoons anymore.

119
00:07:26,737 --> 00:07:30,658
I like being on TV,
so I'm quitting the webtoon industry.

120
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:33,786
There's no need to draw such a hard line.

121
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:37,206
JUST KIDDING

122
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,877
Wait, there's Ki-hong and…

123
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:49,177
THERE ARE NO NEW GUESTS TODAY

124
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:52,013
THINKING

125
00:07:52,096 --> 00:07:55,391
-What time are you leaving?
-The boat departs at 3 p.m.,

126
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:57,268
but we have to leave at 10:30 a.m.

127
00:07:57,351 --> 00:07:58,769
Really?

128
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:02,273
Don't go.

129
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:07,528
FEELING SAD

130
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:10,198
WHAT IF THERE ARE NO NEW GUESTS TODAY?

131
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:12,742
-Ki-hong?
-Yes?

132
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:16,621
Do you guys want to stay an extra day?

133
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:19,999
Is that okay?

134
00:08:20,082 --> 00:08:21,501
-It's fine by me.
-Really?

135
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:25,213
Stay one more day then.
We don't have any new guests today.

136
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:30,343
-Oh, really?
-Seong-eun!

137
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:31,969
SUNG-HO, NOT SEONG-EUN

138
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:33,346
Stay an extra day!

139
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:34,597
-Can I do that?
-Yes.

140
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,516
Sweet.

141
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:40,019
-Ah-jin, can you also stay longer?
-Let me check.

142
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:41,270
-Really?
-Yes.

143
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:42,313
That's great.

144
00:08:42,396 --> 00:08:43,689
1ST GUESTS TO EXTEND THEIR STAY?

145
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:46,400
You're all staying an extra day, right?

146
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:47,652
I will.

147
00:08:47,735 --> 00:08:49,403
EXTENDING THEIR STAY
SUNG-HO: YES

148
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:51,364
I already have plans.

149
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:53,908
That's a shame.

150
00:08:53,991 --> 00:08:56,244
I think I need to get going.

151
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:58,329
SEONG-EUN: NO

152
00:08:58,412 --> 00:09:00,748
Jin-hong is staying, right?

153
00:09:00,831 --> 00:09:03,543
Ki-hong has a tutoring session tomorrow.

154
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:05,419
Ki-hong too?

155
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:08,130
KI-HONG: NO

156
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:10,216
Have a seat for now.

157
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:11,467
I need to make one more.

158
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:13,302
LET'S HAVE A TALK

159
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:14,720
Everyone sit down for now.

160
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:18,474
Ki-hong, come over here.
Let's have a talk.

161
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,143
-Sit down, Ki-hong.
-Okay.

162
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:24,355
This is tight.

163
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:26,065
This is tight.

164
00:09:26,148 --> 00:09:28,276
Oh, I feel so much affection.

165
00:09:30,861 --> 00:09:32,363
So, you're leaving to tutor someone?

166
00:09:32,446 --> 00:09:34,198
-Well…
-What did they say?

167
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:36,826
Invite them over
and say you'll tutor them here.

168
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:38,411
That's a great idea.

169
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:41,831
-Where do they live?
-In Gwangju.

170
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:42,748
Gwangju?

171
00:09:42,873 --> 00:09:45,167
That's a stone's throw away
from Ulleungdo Island.

172
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:50,631
I'm not forcing you to stay.
I just want you here longer.

173
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:52,592
-Let me tell you this.
-Yes?

174
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:58,180
If I wanted you to leave,
I'd just say, "Bye, it's been fun."

175
00:10:00,349 --> 00:10:01,892
-I can talk to them.
-Okay.

176
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:03,311
And put it off by a day.

177
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:05,605
-Really?
-It's possible.

178
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:08,149
Staying here is also my wish.

179
00:10:08,232 --> 00:10:09,859
I feel sad about leaving.

180
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:13,237
But what I want is
for all three of us to stay.

181
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,865
Of course, you do.

182
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:17,283
-I think he's neutral.
-So…

183
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:18,492
NEXT TARGET

184
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:19,952
What gave you a hard time here?

185
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:23,414
Tell me exactly what it was.
I'm asking because I'm so sad.

186
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:26,876
-I'll get a door on the first floor.
-No, that's okay.

187
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,294
THAT DIDN'T WORK

188
00:10:28,377 --> 00:10:33,716
I think today's weather is perfect
for finding an undiscovered bird species.

189
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:36,052
SWITCHING GEARS

190
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:38,220
DO YOU STILL WANT TO LEAVE?

191
00:10:41,223 --> 00:10:43,100
-I'm not trying to force you.
-Right.

192
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:46,187
-When does the boat leave?
-At 3 p.m.

193
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:48,105
Then let's head out for now.

194
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:53,235
Seong-eun says he's leaving.

195
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:55,821
What a shame.

196
00:10:57,406 --> 00:10:59,075
-Ah-jin, are you leaving?
-Yes.

197
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:00,159
-Today?
-Yes.

198
00:11:00,242 --> 00:11:02,119
But you said you'd stay an extra day.

199
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:04,580
AH-JIN HAS ANOTHER SCHEDULE

200
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:07,792
-I see. You have stuff to do.
-Right.

201
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:08,793
AH-JIN: NO

202
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:11,087
How about we grab a meal before you leave?

203
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:12,963
-Let's get lunch together.
-Let's.

204
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:14,882
-What do you kids think?
-Sounds good.

205
00:11:14,965 --> 00:11:15,966
WE LOVE IT

206
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:17,551
We'll have to get going then.

207
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:19,595
Let's go.

208
00:11:19,678 --> 00:11:21,889
OFF TO EAT MULHOE

209
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:28,771
I think this is the place.

210
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:30,439
-Are we here?
-This way?

211
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:32,608
-Well, raise your hand if you want mulhoe.
-Yes.

212
00:11:32,691 --> 00:11:35,111
SQUID MULHOE

213
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:37,988
-And two steamed whole squid.
-Okay.

214
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:40,366
Wait, what's our schedule today?

215
00:11:40,449 --> 00:11:41,575
ORGANIZING TODAY'S AGENDA

216
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:44,161
We rented electric motorbikes,
so we have to return them.

217
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:45,704
You're returning them today?

218
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:47,540
THREE MOTORBIKES TO RETURN

219
00:11:47,623 --> 00:11:51,001
BUT ONLY TWO RENTERS

220
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:55,673
Let's send Seong-eun off first,
and I'll go with you to return them.

221
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:57,800
JIN WILL HELP RETURN THE MOTORBIKES

222
00:11:57,883 --> 00:12:00,678
IN THE MEANTIME,
KIAN AND YE-EUN WILL PREPARE DINNER

223
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:01,846
I'm really a good cook.

224
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:05,099
We'll cook something good
for dinner tonight.

225
00:12:05,182 --> 00:12:06,767
But it was good last night too.

226
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:08,227
Gosh, my hand smells like curry!

227
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:11,564
It was good.

228
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:12,565
Oh, right!

229
00:12:12,648 --> 00:12:14,733
One of the suggestions from yesterday

230
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:18,070
was to offer
Kian-style welcome drinks to the guests.

231
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:19,572
Welcome drinks?

232
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:22,241
How about welcome rice balls instead?

233
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:24,201
-That sounds good.
-Right?

234
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:26,203
That's a great idea.

235
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:29,498
That's genius.
I never would've imagined such a word.

236
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:33,711
We have leftover kimchi, right?
I'll make kimchi fried rice.

237
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:36,338
"Welcome kimchi rice balls."

238
00:12:37,214 --> 00:12:38,591
I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO IT

239
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:42,887
-That looks insane.
-It looks amazing.

240
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:44,430
It's dark-banded rockfish and squid.

241
00:12:44,513 --> 00:12:45,973
SQUID MULHOE

242
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:48,642
It looks so delicious.

243
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:55,524
HOW TO ENJOY ULLEUNGDO MULHOE
1. FIRST, ENJOY ALL THE MIXED INGREDIENTS

244
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:58,402
Eat it as a dry-mixed version first.

245
00:12:58,486 --> 00:13:03,032
Then add some broth
and try it with noodles or rice.

246
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:06,702
2. ADD BROTH OR WATER TO SLURP
TOGETHER WITH RICE OR NOODLES

247
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,625
THIS IS DELICIOUS

248
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:13,918
This looks delicious.

249
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:19,673
I love mulhoe.

250
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:27,223
JIN ADDS MORE BROTH

251
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:30,476
This is good.

252
00:13:36,815 --> 00:13:38,734
STEAMED WHOLE SQUID

253
00:13:38,817 --> 00:13:40,819
-They're so plump.
-That looks amazing.

254
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:44,823
-I'm on cloud nine today.
-Me too.

255
00:14:04,843 --> 00:14:06,303
You guys eat pretty slowly.

256
00:14:08,138 --> 00:14:11,642
EVERYONE IS STILL EATING

257
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:20,734
I'm sleepy.

258
00:14:25,155 --> 00:14:28,742
Ye-eun, pay the bill
and bring the leftovers.

259
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:31,620
-Where are you going?
-What?

260
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:35,624
You need to stay
since you're the B&B owner.

261
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:38,252
Just enjoy the meal at your own pace.

262
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:41,589
Enjoy your meal.

263
00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:43,549
Thank you.

264
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:49,305
And he just left?

265
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:52,057
Why is he acting like that?
I'll go out and ask.

266
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:54,310
What's going on?

267
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:03,110
SCANS THE AREA

268
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:06,739
TRUDGES

269
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:14,079
OBSERVING THE OWNER

270
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:17,541
This isn't a road, is it?

271
00:15:22,546 --> 00:15:23,464
I'll just…

272
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:26,592
I'll just lie down for ten minutes.

273
00:15:31,221 --> 00:15:34,266
They say if you lie down after eating,
you'll turn into a cow.

274
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:35,517
A cow it is, then.

275
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:01,919
OWNER'S PHILOSOPHY:
WHEREVER I LIE BECOMES MY BED

276
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:13,097
Living like you
is pretty nice and relaxing.

277
00:16:14,598 --> 00:16:15,849
That's right.

278
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:22,690
FULLY ADAPTED TO KIAN-STYLE

279
00:16:38,455 --> 00:16:41,000
TEN MINUTES LATER

280
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:43,460
Gosh.

281
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,422
This guy is amazing.

282
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:48,549
How can he lie down right after eating?

283
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:55,514
-Have they come out yet?
-No.

284
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:58,517
I was going to paint for the guests.

285
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:01,270
I even brought canvases and paint.

286
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:04,023
If you want to paint for them,

287
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:07,067
you need to leave everything
up to me and Ye-eun.

288
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:11,155
But right now, we're short on manpower.

289
00:17:11,238 --> 00:17:13,073
No, we have some time.

290
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:14,950
We're not super busy.

291
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:16,744
Haven't you ever been busy, Kian?

292
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:20,330
I'm sure you've had to draw all day
and slept for only an hour.

293
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:22,750
I got a few hours of sleep.

294
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:27,337
Right, compared to that,
this is relaxing and peaceful.

295
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:28,756
-Really?
-Yes.

296
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:30,549
Let's go.

297
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,430
-Take care!
-Thanks for coming.

298
00:17:36,513 --> 00:17:37,806
I had a great time.

299
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,475
-It was fun.
-Bye-bye.

300
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:40,517
GOODBYE, AH-JIN

301
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:43,228
-Good luck with everything.
-Say goodbye to Ah-jin.

302
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:45,105
Take care, Seong-eun.

303
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:47,232
GOODBYE, SEONG-EUN

304
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:49,693
Why do you have to leave already?

305
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:52,738
-It was fun. Come back again.
-Okay.

306
00:17:52,821 --> 00:17:54,323
-Thanks for everything.
-Bye.

307
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:55,783
Thank you.

308
00:17:56,533 --> 00:17:57,993
-Have a safe trip back.
-Bye.

309
00:17:58,077 --> 00:17:59,703
-Thanks for the benches!
-No problem.

310
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:00,788
Take care.

311
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:02,331
My first impression of the place

312
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:05,042
was that it was scary
because how could a house look like that?

313
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:07,252
But it became fun as time went by.

314
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:09,797
This holiday had Kian written all over it.

315
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,424
Honestly, the whole vibe was great.

316
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:18,013
Thanks to Kian's B&B,
I think I was able to challenge myself.

317
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:20,140
Thanks, Kian.

318
00:18:20,724 --> 00:18:23,310
AH-JIN AND SEONG-EUN CHECK OUT

319
00:18:23,393 --> 00:18:24,394
Here we are.

320
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:27,231
STAFF AND KAIST TEAM
RETURN TO HYEONPO PORT

321
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:31,026
-Be careful on that bike.
-Okay.

322
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:33,779
ELECTRIC MOTORBIKES TO RETURN

323
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:36,990
KAIST TEAM'S MODE OF TRANSPORTATION

324
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:40,202
This is great!

325
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:41,578
A MUST-HAVE ON AN ULLEUNGDO TRIP

326
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:43,956
Wow, the scenery is nice.

327
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:45,582
JIN WILL RETURN SEONG-EUN'S MOTORBIKE

328
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:48,168
Let's go.

329
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:50,379
OFF TO RETURN THE MOTORBIKES

330
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:54,883
This is so convenient.

331
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:58,428
It'd be fun to go on a trip on this.

332
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:03,809
It's raining.

333
00:19:10,732 --> 00:19:12,693
Seriously? It's raining!

334
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:15,779
-It's cool when it rains.
-It gets damp when it does!

335
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:18,824
-You mean dewy and nice.
-I mean gross and sticky!

336
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:21,743
Go down the yellow slide
and into the water.

337
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:24,580
-You want me to go straight in the pool?
-Yes.

338
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:27,249
I like how I can't even feel
the motor running.

339
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:29,126
-Electric motorbikes are powerful.
-Exactly.

340
00:19:29,209 --> 00:19:30,586
Is it even faster downhill?

341
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:33,297
-It depends on the acceleration,
-I see.

342
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:35,549
so Ki-hong and I will probably
beat you downhill.

343
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:41,221
Holy moly, it's pretty.

344
00:19:50,105 --> 00:19:51,815
Hello, sir.

345
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:53,275
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

346
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:54,985
RETURN COMPLETE

347
00:19:55,777 --> 00:19:57,487
IT'S ALSO RAINING AT KIAN'S B&B

348
00:19:57,571 --> 00:20:00,449
KIAN AND YE-EUN QUICKLY RETURN

349
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:02,826
-Let's take this upstairs.
-Okay.

350
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:06,413
SHORTCUT FOR SMALL ITEMS

351
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,251
Be careful!

352
00:20:16,673 --> 00:20:17,841
-Ye-eun!
-Yes?

353
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:19,676
-Oh, my!
-Can you grab my stuff?

354
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,803
-What stuff?
-It's down there.

355
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,305
You'll see my…

356
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:24,848
-The toothbrush?
-Yes.

357
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:28,268
Please be careful!

358
00:20:33,982 --> 00:20:35,567
Can't you get a new toothbrush?

359
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:37,736
Seriously.

360
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:39,988
I had no idea
he carried his toothbrush like that.

361
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:42,241
I wish he'd at least put a cover
on the toothbrush.

362
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:43,450
You use it for your teeth.

363
00:20:43,533 --> 00:20:44,910
But he doesn't put a cover on it.

364
00:20:44,993 --> 00:20:47,746
I thought it was a brush
used to clean floors.

365
00:20:47,829 --> 00:20:49,414
Look at this toothbrush.

366
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:51,500
Your teeth will rot more if you use this.

367
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,584
Okay.

368
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:05,389
It's slippery. Be careful.

369
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:08,892
It's so slippery.

370
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:17,526
I'm okay.

371
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:23,699
Give me my toothbrush.

372
00:21:25,325 --> 00:21:26,451
Give me my toothbrush.

373
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,998
Don't make me laugh.

374
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:33,792
-I feel weak from laughing.
-Sorry.

375
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:35,544
I dropped it after brushing my teeth.

376
00:21:40,924 --> 00:21:42,592
JUST TAKES THE TOOTHBRUSH

377
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:47,014
-Be careful.
-What do I do?

378
00:21:47,597 --> 00:21:48,640
I can't do it.

379
00:21:49,349 --> 00:21:50,767
Wait, hold on.

380
00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:52,477
You can let go of me.

381
00:21:56,898 --> 00:21:59,026
Damn it, Kian84!

382
00:21:59,109 --> 00:21:59,985
Damn you!

383
00:22:05,782 --> 00:22:06,616
Let's see here.

384
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:07,784
Maybe we should…

385
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:15,042
What are you going to do?

386
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:16,710
I'm making welcome fried rice.

387
00:22:16,793 --> 00:22:18,337
Why are you making it already?

388
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:19,880
It's better to start early.

389
00:22:19,963 --> 00:22:21,298
But they arrive tomorrow.

390
00:22:21,381 --> 00:22:23,467
-I'll store it well.
-Okay.

391
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:27,888
MAKE WELCOME RICE BALLS
A DAY BEFORE CHECK-IN

392
00:22:37,397 --> 00:22:41,068
USING BOTTLED WATER FOR THE GUESTS

393
00:22:42,986 --> 00:22:44,446
BUILDING A FIRE IN THE STOVE

394
00:22:45,947 --> 00:22:47,491
RICE PREP COMPLETE

395
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:53,955
Whenever I offer…

396
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:57,084
I don't know why,
but whenever I offer to cook…

397
00:22:57,167 --> 00:22:59,252
People react weirdly.

398
00:22:59,336 --> 00:23:02,672
But Jin said to me,

399
00:23:02,756 --> 00:23:05,383
"People don't come here
for omakase or Korean beef.

400
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:09,096
They're here for Kian84's cooking.

401
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:12,182
They probably come here for that."

402
00:23:12,265 --> 00:23:14,851
So, I felt pretty encouraged
when I heard that.

403
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:18,688
WASHES HANDS BEFORE PREPPING INGREDIENTS

404
00:23:18,772 --> 00:23:20,732
WELCOME RICE BALL INGREDIENT 1
KIMCHI

405
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:23,110
I'll need a lot of kimchi.

406
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:30,200
WASHES HIS HANDS AGAIN

407
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:32,119
INGREDIENT 2
PORK BELLY

408
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:37,666
LET'S GET TO STIR-FRYING NOW

409
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:41,128
ADD KIMCHI TO COOKED RICE

410
00:23:43,171 --> 00:23:44,047
Dump it all in.

411
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:48,176
ADD PORK BELLY THAT'S BEEN GRILLED ONCE

412
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:50,470
POUR IN SOME SUGAR

413
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:54,850
A PILE OF SUGAR

414
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:08,155
STIR THE SUGAR EVENLY

415
00:24:13,368 --> 00:24:16,538
HOW ABOUT A TASTE TEST?

416
00:24:21,835 --> 00:24:23,920
MSG TO THE RESCUE

417
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:29,259
ADD SOME PEPPER TOO

418
00:24:46,693 --> 00:24:49,112
STIR-FRYING COMPLETE

419
00:24:49,196 --> 00:24:50,947
I think I need gloves for this.

420
00:24:51,615 --> 00:24:53,450
GRABS DISPOSABLE GLOVES

421
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:56,494
DETERMINED

422
00:24:57,454 --> 00:24:58,997
ONE FISTFUL

423
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,916
ANOTHER FISTFUL

424
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:09,758
TAKES SOME OUT

425
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:11,593
ADDS SOME AGAIN

426
00:25:12,552 --> 00:25:15,639
TRIES TO GUESS THE EXACT WEIGHT BY HAND

427
00:25:20,101 --> 00:25:22,103
SERIOUS

428
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:24,648
MAKES RICE BALLS WITHOUT STOPPING

429
00:25:24,731 --> 00:25:26,983
FILLS UP A WHOLE TRAY

430
00:25:28,401 --> 00:25:31,029
REACHES THE BOTTOM OF THE POT

431
00:25:31,112 --> 00:25:33,740
Shit, this won't work.
The center is totally burned.

432
00:25:34,908 --> 00:25:36,576
I'LL EAT THE BURNT PARTS

433
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:41,414
This much should be okay to eat.

434
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:45,877
IT'S NOT OKAY

435
00:25:46,461 --> 00:25:49,631
Our boss, Kian, is very hygienic.

436
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:52,801
He washes his hands thoroughly
and all that.

437
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:56,304
But when you watch him cook,
he uses his hands for no special reason.

438
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:58,223
But he did wash his hands.

439
00:25:58,306 --> 00:26:01,142
He's very hygienic
yet unhygienic at the same time.

440
00:26:01,851 --> 00:26:04,020
THIS ISN'T OVER YET

441
00:26:04,104 --> 00:26:06,648
PUTS ON A NEW PAIR OF GLOVES

442
00:26:08,358 --> 00:26:09,818
ADDS A POOL OF COOKING OIL

443
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:11,486
ONE MORE TIME

444
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:15,782
KIAN-STYLE RICE BALLS ARE COATED IN OIL

445
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,792
No, don't break apart.

446
00:26:28,044 --> 00:26:30,171
IT'S NOT WORKING SO WELL

447
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,300
Let's try rice squares, then.

448
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:35,593
I should've flattened these.

449
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:45,478
KIMCHI PANCAKES?

450
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:54,029
THIS ISN'T EASY

451
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:56,781
They look better this way.

452
00:26:56,865 --> 00:27:00,160
I shouldn't have poured so much oil.

453
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:02,912
Crispy on the outside,
tender on the inside.

454
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:05,457
This looks good.

455
00:27:08,543 --> 00:27:10,003
I didn't ruin them.

456
00:27:18,011 --> 00:27:19,220
Damn, that's hot.

457
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:21,973
KIAN-STYLE WELCOME RICE BALLS COMPLETE

458
00:27:23,433 --> 00:27:24,517
Gosh, my back hurts.

459
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:28,772
DOES THE DISHES RIGHT AWAY

460
00:27:28,855 --> 00:27:30,315
I'm exhausted.

461
00:27:30,398 --> 00:27:32,984
If I were cooking for myself,
I wouldn't go through all this.

462
00:27:37,238 --> 00:27:39,574
I'm doing more dishes here
than I do in a year.

463
00:27:40,658 --> 00:27:41,910
This is crazy.

464
00:27:41,993 --> 00:27:44,037
I never knew I was this hygienic.

465
00:27:49,876 --> 00:27:52,337
MEANWHILE, YE-EUN IS TIDYING UP THE HOUSE

466
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:04,724
-Boss?
-Yes?

467
00:28:04,808 --> 00:28:07,435
-Should I start cooking at 6 p.m.?
-Yes.

468
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:09,604
-Hey, by the way,
-Yes?

469
00:28:09,687 --> 00:28:13,900
-I made those welcome rice balls.
-Okay.

470
00:28:13,983 --> 00:28:19,072
But I think we can serve them today
to anyone who is hungry.

471
00:28:19,155 --> 00:28:21,074
But that goes against the concept

472
00:28:21,157 --> 00:28:23,034
-of welcome rice balls.
-Right.

473
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:24,744
-But I think it'll be better
-Yes?

474
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:26,413
to eat them today.

475
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:28,665
I want to see how people will react.

476
00:28:28,748 --> 00:28:31,000
Sorry, but I want them
to try my food today.

477
00:28:31,084 --> 00:28:31,918
That's fine.

478
00:28:32,001 --> 00:28:36,881
I know you want to prove yourself today,
but I feel the same way about my food.

479
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:38,341
Okay, we'll eat that then.

480
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:42,679
I usually don't like to cook,
but I wanted to today.

481
00:28:43,513 --> 00:28:46,057
WELCOME RICE BALLS
HAVE TURNED TO DINNER RICE BALLS

482
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:47,851
I'll fry these eggs, and…

483
00:28:47,934 --> 00:28:49,018
DINNER RICE BALL FINALE

484
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:51,396
Darn it.

485
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,106
What a waste.

486
00:28:53,189 --> 00:28:54,733
YOLK FELL ON THE FLOOR

487
00:28:55,525 --> 00:28:58,153
3-SECOND RULE

488
00:29:00,029 --> 00:29:02,449
GRABS A NEW SPOON

489
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:20,091
CAREFULLY

490
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:23,887
DUMPS IT OUT

491
00:29:26,639 --> 00:29:29,100
ADDS MORE EGGS

492
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:35,940
GENEROUS AMOUNT OF FRIED EGGS

493
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:38,234
NO, SCRAMBLED EGGS

494
00:29:45,492 --> 00:29:48,995
ADDITIONAL DISH
SCRAMBLED EGGS COMPLETE

495
00:29:49,078 --> 00:29:51,122
-I'm coming down.
-Okay.

496
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:52,457
I'm coming down.

497
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:54,083
-Just don't let go.
-Don't let go?

498
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:56,795
Okay, you've got this.

499
00:29:56,878 --> 00:29:58,004
One, two, three.

500
00:30:03,718 --> 00:30:05,303
-I'm good at this.
-You are.

501
00:30:05,386 --> 00:30:06,888
This looks really good.

502
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:08,473
My cooking isn't bad.

503
00:30:08,556 --> 00:30:11,476
Being here
makes everything look delicious.

504
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:15,897
Let's put these on the floor
over there for now.

505
00:30:17,065 --> 00:30:19,317
They can eat as soon as they come.

506
00:30:20,068 --> 00:30:22,529
DINNER COMPLETE

507
00:30:22,612 --> 00:30:24,280
MEANWHILE

508
00:30:24,364 --> 00:30:25,907
Shall I take a picture of you?

509
00:30:26,533 --> 00:30:28,243
THE HA FAMILY IS ON DOKDO OBSERVATORY TOUR

510
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:30,078
-Why are you making that face?
-I'm scared.

511
00:30:31,621 --> 00:30:32,580
I'm scared!

512
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:34,749
You're scared? Really?

513
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:35,792
DAM'S A CHICKEN

514
00:30:35,875 --> 00:30:38,169
I'm going to jump!

515
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:39,504
-No, come on.
-No, Dad.

516
00:30:39,587 --> 00:30:42,632
-Then, will you two be good boys now?
-We will.

517
00:30:42,715 --> 00:30:45,176
-Promise me.
-Yes, sir.

518
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:46,678
Promise you'll do as I say.

519
00:30:46,761 --> 00:30:49,013
It's windy.
You know what'll happen if I jump.

520
00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:55,019
ARRIVED AT THE OBSERVATORY

521
00:30:55,103 --> 00:30:56,104
I love it here.

522
00:30:57,897 --> 00:31:00,358
Take it all in while you can.

523
00:31:02,068 --> 00:31:04,529
TAKES A PICTURE OF THE HA BROTHERS

524
00:31:07,782 --> 00:31:09,868
STAIRS NEXT TO THE OBSERVATORY

525
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:11,911
Dad, let's go back down!

526
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:14,414
I CAN'T GO

527
00:31:14,497 --> 00:31:16,875
What are you so scared of?

528
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:18,626
Come here. I'll hold your hand.

529
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:20,211
Take my hand.

530
00:31:26,175 --> 00:31:28,761
-Wait.
-There's no way I can go up.

531
00:31:28,845 --> 00:31:30,805
NOW THE OLDER BROTHER FREAKS OUT

532
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:33,683
Okay, come here then. Take my hand.

533
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:35,393
THE BROTHERS RETREAT

534
00:31:35,476 --> 00:31:38,313
Your hand is so sweaty.

535
00:31:39,647 --> 00:31:40,773
Ha Dam.

536
00:31:42,984 --> 00:31:44,903
-The higher we went--
-You're weak.

537
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:48,406
-It's because we take after you.
-Touché.

538
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:51,659
MEANWHILE, THE CLIMBING TEAM

539
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:53,328
The weather is great.

540
00:31:55,872 --> 00:31:56,998
The sun is so bright.

541
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:00,627
-This looks fun.
-Are we going straight up?

542
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:02,462
It's a direct ascent.

543
00:32:02,545 --> 00:32:04,005
-Do you approve?
-I do.

544
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:05,965
-Let's do this.
-Okay.

545
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:08,259
Let's start off like this.

546
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:09,886
Use your right hand.

547
00:32:09,969 --> 00:32:12,430
BOULDERING:
ROCK CLIMBING WITHOUT THE USE OF ROPE

548
00:32:13,514 --> 00:32:15,016
I can finally wear my climbing shoes.

549
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:16,809
-It's our first time here.
-Right.

550
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:20,688
MIN-SEOB GOES FIRST

551
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:22,315
You're a pro now.

552
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:25,193
-You're such a pro.
-That's smart.

553
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:27,070
There's a mat, so just go for it.

554
00:32:46,047 --> 00:32:49,550
Take the easy route,
the one you know you can do.

555
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:00,728
Nice job!

556
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:03,064
He climbed for dear life toward the end.

557
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:04,649
You climbed for dear life, right?

558
00:33:04,732 --> 00:33:06,317
-I almost died.
-I know.

559
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:09,862
MIN-JUN GOES NEXT

560
00:33:16,703 --> 00:33:17,578
That hold?

561
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:24,252
It was harder than I thought.

562
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:25,837
Let's go.

563
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,463
TAE-IN IS UP NOW

564
00:33:33,219 --> 00:33:34,595
Don't overdo it.

565
00:33:43,146 --> 00:33:45,898
Nice!

566
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:47,358
Let's go eat now.

567
00:33:47,442 --> 00:33:50,278
-We just need to pack up.
-It'll be time to eat.

568
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:51,696
That was a fun two hours.

569
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:53,406
-That was fun.
-I really had fun.

570
00:33:53,489 --> 00:33:55,074
TODAY'S CLIMB WAS SATISFACTORY

571
00:33:55,158 --> 00:33:58,077
THE OWNER IS ALSO CLIMBING

572
00:34:00,246 --> 00:34:01,873
SLIPS

573
00:34:03,916 --> 00:34:05,084
Why is it so slippery?

574
00:34:05,918 --> 00:34:07,754
And why is it slippery up here, too?

575
00:34:07,837 --> 00:34:10,506
There's cooking oil on here as well.

576
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:12,216
No, don't get oil on it.

577
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,468
Give my feet a push.

578
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:14,927
-Your feet?
-Push my feet.

579
00:34:15,428 --> 00:34:16,554
Harder!

580
00:34:17,513 --> 00:34:19,307
-Hold on.
-This won't work.

581
00:34:19,974 --> 00:34:21,100
Step on this.

582
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:32,570
Why is it so slippery?

583
00:34:35,531 --> 00:34:36,616
How will I go up?

584
00:34:39,035 --> 00:34:41,162
-All right.
-How will we get up now?

585
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:43,414
It's because my feet are dusty.

586
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:48,503
I even washed my hands.

587
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:00,973
You're there. You made it.

588
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,694
I need a break.

589
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:16,864
I'm exhausted.

590
00:35:23,371 --> 00:35:24,497
Hi, Mom.

591
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:27,959
I wanted to know how you're doing.

592
00:35:28,042 --> 00:35:30,128
-Are you in Seoul? Where are you?
-Ulleungdo Island.

593
00:35:30,211 --> 00:35:34,132
-When did you get there?
-About 4 or 5 days ago, I think.

594
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:37,260
-My goodness.
-I'm just doing my best here.

595
00:35:37,343 --> 00:35:39,679
-It's hot, but it's fine.
-Have you eaten?

596
00:35:39,762 --> 00:35:42,140
I've been eating pretty well and such.

597
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:46,686
They're younger than me,
so I should look after them.

598
00:35:46,769 --> 00:35:49,188
-Yes, you should.
-Right.

599
00:35:49,272 --> 00:35:52,984
I'll call you again later
if anything comes up.

600
00:35:53,067 --> 00:35:54,735
-Call me whenever.
-Okay.

601
00:35:59,782 --> 00:36:05,204
JIN AND THE KAIST TEAM RETURN

602
00:36:06,581 --> 00:36:07,957
Boss!

603
00:36:09,208 --> 00:36:10,835
Boss, why aren't you cooking?

604
00:36:11,377 --> 00:36:12,336
I'm done.

605
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:14,463
We're having rice balls.

606
00:36:14,547 --> 00:36:15,673
Sounds good!

607
00:36:15,756 --> 00:36:17,425
I'm hungry. Can I have one now?

608
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:18,593
I'm so hungry.

609
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:20,469
I need food.

610
00:36:32,607 --> 00:36:36,485
Once I go down,
I can't get back up without the climbers.

611
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:37,778
-Do you have your phone?
-Yes.

612
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:40,031
-Your charger?
-They'll send it down for me.

613
00:36:40,114 --> 00:36:41,157
Sure, I'll do that.

614
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,241
WE'RE ALL SET

615
00:36:42,992 --> 00:36:47,079
LET'S HEAD DOWN TO THE DINING HALL

616
00:36:49,665 --> 00:36:51,292
Are those rice balls?

617
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:55,671
TODAY'S DINNER
KIAN-STYLE RICE BALLS & SCRAMBLED EGGS

618
00:36:55,755 --> 00:36:56,672
Do I use my hands?

619
00:36:56,756 --> 00:36:59,634
EATING WITH BARE HANDS AGAIN TODAY

620
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:01,636
Which one is the tastiest?

621
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:08,809
These eggs look good.

622
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:10,311
A LADLE FOR SERVING SCRAMBLED EGGS

623
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:13,648
BEGINS EATING WITH BARE HANDS

624
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:15,524
It tastes like kimchi pancake.

625
00:37:15,608 --> 00:37:17,902
Why do I taste kimchi pancake
in a rice ball?

626
00:37:19,654 --> 00:37:20,821
-You're right.
-Right?

627
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:22,114
It really does.

628
00:37:22,198 --> 00:37:24,325
-Who made these?
-Our boss.

629
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:26,118
It's good.

630
00:37:26,202 --> 00:37:27,453
It's not bad.

631
00:37:27,995 --> 00:37:31,123
-Dinner here has been good so far.
-Yesterday's curry was good, too.

632
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:33,834
I think we're used to this place now.

633
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:37,755
YESTERDAY,
YE-EUN ATE WHILE FACING THE WALL

634
00:37:37,838 --> 00:37:40,299
SHE GOT USED TO EATING
WITH HER HANDS IN A DAY

635
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:47,640
NATURALLY EATING WITH BARE HANDS

636
00:37:47,723 --> 00:37:51,018
NATURALLY DOING THEIR OWN DISHES

637
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:54,313
EVERYONE IS GETTING USED TO KIAN'S B&B

638
00:37:54,397 --> 00:37:56,107
We can't go through there, can we?

639
00:37:58,818 --> 00:38:01,445
How did the climbers help you up?

640
00:38:01,529 --> 00:38:03,864
We wore life jackets
when we went down, remember?

641
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:05,700
REELING

642
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:06,617
Life jackets?

643
00:38:07,576 --> 00:38:08,452
Life jackets?

644
00:38:12,164 --> 00:38:14,292
When did it get so late?

645
00:38:22,425 --> 00:38:24,719
-You're pretty good.
-Great teamwork.

646
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:28,306
Is Ki-hong up here?

647
00:38:28,389 --> 00:38:29,390
No, not yet.

648
00:38:31,183 --> 00:38:32,310
That's a problem.

649
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:34,145
I'll go first and pull you up.

650
00:38:34,228 --> 00:38:35,396
You make it look easy.

651
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:36,480
Ki-hong?

652
00:38:37,064 --> 00:38:38,232
Do you see that?

653
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:40,818
Let's drag that over here
and use it to get up.

654
00:38:40,901 --> 00:38:43,821
-Use what?
-That green thing.

655
00:38:43,904 --> 00:38:45,573
THAT GREEN THING

656
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:47,366
-We need this.
-This right here?

657
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:49,160
-I'll do it.
-Let's do it together.

658
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:50,828
Lift that side.

659
00:38:50,911 --> 00:38:52,371
They're bringing it here.

660
00:38:52,455 --> 00:38:54,040
They're using the shelving?

661
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:56,000
We've got this!

662
00:38:56,083 --> 00:38:57,710
I can climb up on my own now.

663
00:38:57,793 --> 00:38:58,961
We need to push it a bit.

664
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:00,629
Hey, this is easy.

665
00:39:01,297 --> 00:39:02,631
Push me. Pull me up!

666
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:04,342
This is too…

667
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:09,096
-Watch your head.
-Let go.

668
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:11,390
Should we let you go or pull you up?

669
00:39:16,145 --> 00:39:18,147
Should we let you go or pull you up?

670
00:39:25,237 --> 00:39:26,447
There's that face again.

671
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:28,199
There it is again.

672
00:39:32,995 --> 00:39:33,913
Be careful.

673
00:39:34,955 --> 00:39:37,708
Here we go. One, two, three.

674
00:39:38,292 --> 00:39:40,336
You're good. Use your feet more.

675
00:39:44,507 --> 00:39:46,092
You're good. Use your feet more.

676
00:39:52,264 --> 00:39:53,724
Come on up.

677
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:55,351
I'm good now.

678
00:39:56,018 --> 00:39:57,019
That's enough.

679
00:39:58,354 --> 00:40:00,314
Can I shake your hand?

680
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:01,816
-Thanks so much.
-Sure thing.

681
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:07,822
The clouds are pretty.

682
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:12,201
WITH PRETTY CLOUDS IN THE BACKGROUND

683
00:40:12,284 --> 00:40:14,286
CAPTAIN JI PICKS UP THE GUESTS BY BOAT

684
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:15,621
Kian's B&B guests, come aboard!

685
00:40:16,622 --> 00:40:17,873
Hello.

686
00:40:17,957 --> 00:40:18,999
Watch your step.

687
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:23,921
THE CLIMBING TEAM AND THE HA FAMILY RETURN

688
00:40:25,047 --> 00:40:26,799
Let's all have a beer. Hold on.

689
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:29,051
-Shall we sit there?
-On the bench?

690
00:40:29,135 --> 00:40:31,262
A BEER ON THE BENCH MADE BY AH-JIN

691
00:40:31,345 --> 00:40:33,305
Let's sit here like we did earlier.

692
00:40:33,389 --> 00:40:35,349
-I like it.
-It's nice and cozy.

693
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:38,686
The house is so uncomfortable
that sitting like this is comfier.

694
00:40:39,353 --> 00:40:40,646
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

695
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:45,901
That's good.

696
00:40:45,985 --> 00:40:48,237
The breeze feels so nice and cool.

697
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,238
This is nice.

698
00:40:49,321 --> 00:40:50,739
So, are you leaving tomorrow?

699
00:40:50,823 --> 00:40:52,032
-Yes.
-That's right.

700
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:55,119
I was so sad at the thought of leaving
that I couldn't sleep.

701
00:40:55,202 --> 00:40:57,371
-You felt that sad?
-Yes, seriously.

702
00:40:57,455 --> 00:40:59,874
We tried to get him inside,
but he stayed outside.

703
00:40:59,957 --> 00:41:02,293
I laid down on a mat
and looked at the stars,

704
00:41:02,376 --> 00:41:03,711
but I still couldn't go to sleep.

705
00:41:03,794 --> 00:41:05,796
-If I can manage to remember
-Yes?

706
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:08,799
-I'll install a pole in your dorm.
-Thank you.

707
00:41:09,341 --> 00:41:11,886
Everyone I've met
in high school and in college

708
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:14,305
has been really focused on studying.

709
00:41:14,388 --> 00:41:18,017
So, it's been fascinating
to come across so many remarkable people.

710
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:19,852
You guys are remarkable, too.

711
00:41:19,935 --> 00:41:21,645
Never in my life have I met anyone

712
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:24,398
who'd go out at 10 p.m. to catch insects.

713
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:27,193
I bet there are more people
like me out there.

714
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:31,155
Did you see the stars?

715
00:41:31,238 --> 00:41:32,364
-Stars?
-Yes.

716
00:41:32,448 --> 00:41:33,699
I fell asleep before I could.

717
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:35,534
This place is just…

718
00:41:35,618 --> 00:41:37,077
-It's so--
-There are so many.

719
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:39,121
The stars just look bigger here.

720
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:48,005
There's something called the Pleiades.

721
00:41:48,088 --> 00:41:49,465
-Pleiades?
-Yes.

722
00:41:49,548 --> 00:41:51,425
In Korean, it's Jomsaengi-byeol.

723
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:53,177
There are actually tons of stars,

724
00:41:53,677 --> 00:41:55,679
but only seven of them
are bright enough to see.

725
00:41:55,763 --> 00:41:57,097
If they're all visible--

726
00:41:57,181 --> 00:42:00,017
-Your eyesight…
-It means the sky is clear and dark.

727
00:42:00,809 --> 00:42:04,271
But I noticed we could see
up to eight stars here.

728
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:08,192
ULLEUNGDO ISLAND IS A GREAT PLACE
TO SEE THE PLEIADES

729
00:42:08,275 --> 00:42:09,443
How do I say this?

730
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:10,945
I've always wondered

731
00:42:11,028 --> 00:42:13,781
"Is there a wall at the edge of space?"

732
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:14,865
I want to knock on it.

733
00:42:14,949 --> 00:42:17,243
"Is there a floor in space?"

734
00:42:17,326 --> 00:42:18,744
"Is there a ceiling in space?"

735
00:42:19,411 --> 00:42:20,996
What else is fascinating?

736
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:22,790
We can't see the Andromeda Galaxy, right?

737
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:25,125
To be honest, that was a fun conversation.

738
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:26,961
Talking about the stars and science…

739
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:29,547
I've always been curious about science.

740
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:32,550
So, those conversions were a lot of fun.

741
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:33,801
Come and eat.

742
00:42:34,468 --> 00:42:36,220
Today's dinner is courtesy of Kian.

743
00:42:36,845 --> 00:42:38,013
Kian made it.

744
00:42:38,097 --> 00:42:40,391
USING HANDS TO SERVE FOOD

745
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:46,021
Everyone has gotten so used to this place
that they're not bothered by this.

746
00:42:46,105 --> 00:42:48,232
This is better than the curry, right?

747
00:42:48,315 --> 00:42:51,193
I was hoping to get a spoon today…

748
00:42:51,777 --> 00:42:54,905
FIRST REFUSAL TO EAT WITH BARE HANDS?

749
00:42:55,656 --> 00:42:57,283
…because I wanted to refuse it.

750
00:43:00,744 --> 00:43:01,579
Bon appétit.

751
00:43:01,662 --> 00:43:03,747
LOVES EATING WITH BARE HANDS
MORE THAN THE OWNER DOES

752
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:09,420
This is good.

753
00:43:17,469 --> 00:43:18,429
It's kimchi fried rice.

754
00:43:20,139 --> 00:43:21,515
I found some meat.

755
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:22,891
MINING MEAT IN RICE BALLS

756
00:43:24,018 --> 00:43:25,644
-Is the food good?
-Yes.

757
00:43:25,728 --> 00:43:26,729
I'm glad to hear it.

758
00:43:28,314 --> 00:43:29,315
I was wondering…

759
00:43:30,149 --> 00:43:31,150
STARTLED

760
00:43:31,233 --> 00:43:32,443
Did you eat enough?

761
00:43:32,526 --> 00:43:33,944
-Yes.
-We're done eating.

762
00:43:34,028 --> 00:43:35,946
EMPTY BOWLS

763
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:38,574
-I don't think you've had enough.
-No, not at all.

764
00:43:39,074 --> 00:43:41,285
THE RICE BALLS WEREN'T ENOUGH FOR DINNER

765
00:43:41,368 --> 00:43:42,786
Do you want some soy milk?

766
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:44,705
If we add noodles to it,
will it be kongguksu?

767
00:43:44,788 --> 00:43:45,623
-Yes.
-That's right.

768
00:43:45,706 --> 00:43:47,833
-But do we have any noodles?
-Yes, we do.

769
00:43:47,916 --> 00:43:49,126
GREAT!

770
00:43:49,209 --> 00:43:51,879
-We have noodles. Would you like some?
-Would you?

771
00:43:51,962 --> 00:43:53,130
I've always liked kongguksu.

772
00:43:53,213 --> 00:43:54,381
I'm a huge fan, too.

773
00:43:55,716 --> 00:43:56,759
Let's make it, then.

774
00:43:56,842 --> 00:43:58,052
I'm sure we'll enjoy it.

775
00:43:58,135 --> 00:43:59,303
SECOND DISH
KONGGUKSU

776
00:44:00,387 --> 00:44:02,973
Should we make two servings?

777
00:44:03,057 --> 00:44:04,975
KONGGUKSU CUSTOMERS
TAE-IN AND MIN-SEOB

778
00:44:05,059 --> 00:44:08,228
IN CHARGE OF COLD SOYBEAN SOUP
YE-EUN

779
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:14,777
ADDS SOME BAMBOO SALT THAT SHE BROUGHT

780
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:22,826
COLD SOYBEAN SOUP IS NOW READY

781
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:25,162
I added bamboo salt,
so I know it'll be good.

782
00:44:25,245 --> 00:44:26,455
Wow, it's really cold.

783
00:44:26,538 --> 00:44:27,748
CHILLS IT IN THE FREEZER

784
00:44:27,831 --> 00:44:33,712
IN CHARGE OF BOILING NOODLES
JIN

785
00:44:40,219 --> 00:44:41,136
They're done.

786
00:44:42,012 --> 00:44:43,013
Take your time.

787
00:44:53,982 --> 00:44:55,943
Hey, I want some, too.

788
00:44:58,404 --> 00:44:59,363
Holy cow.

789
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:03,992
-Whose bowl is this?
-That's mine. Thank you.

790
00:45:04,076 --> 00:45:05,327
-Thank you.
-Bon appétit.

791
00:45:07,788 --> 00:45:09,748
GLANCES

792
00:45:12,042 --> 00:45:14,002
Why are you looking at me?

793
00:45:14,878 --> 00:45:16,505
This is also hard to eat.

794
00:45:17,089 --> 00:45:19,341
You're right. Kongguksu isn't easy.

795
00:45:19,425 --> 00:45:20,843
WHAT'S SO HARD ABOUT IT?

796
00:45:20,926 --> 00:45:22,803
-This is hard.
-His hand is shaking.

797
00:45:24,471 --> 00:45:26,557
I'll just say this.

798
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:31,812
For me, I can eat curry and jjajang
with my hands just fine.

799
00:45:31,895 --> 00:45:34,314
But Indians would be shocked
to see us eat noodles like this.

800
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:36,442
But that's our rule in this B&B.

801
00:45:36,525 --> 00:45:38,610
If you sit here,
you have to use your hands.

802
00:45:38,694 --> 00:45:40,487
-That's right.
-I agree.

803
00:45:40,571 --> 00:45:42,322
THEY'RE MORE EAGER THAN THE OWNER

804
00:45:44,158 --> 00:45:46,034
I don't blame you for hesitating, though.

805
00:45:46,535 --> 00:45:47,494
Right?

806
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:49,413
I'll reach straight for the rice.

807
00:45:51,290 --> 00:45:53,000
EVEN KIAN HESITATES

808
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:56,962
WAITING FOR OTHERS TO TRY FIRST

809
00:46:08,891 --> 00:46:11,768
-This isn't too bad.
-You know this is cruel, right?

810
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:14,521
-"This is cruel."
-It's cold.

811
00:46:15,772 --> 00:46:17,274
It's cruel because it's cold.

812
00:46:17,357 --> 00:46:18,942
-I see.
-You have to eat it cold.

813
00:46:24,364 --> 00:46:25,365
This is really good.

814
00:46:28,702 --> 00:46:29,703
NODS

815
00:46:29,786 --> 00:46:32,372
-How is it?
-It's really good.

816
00:46:35,167 --> 00:46:37,920
-Is it too bland?
-Can I get some salt, please?

817
00:46:38,504 --> 00:46:41,048
-Right, you need salt.
-Can I get some sugar?

818
00:46:42,049 --> 00:46:45,177
-This has to be seasoned with sugar.
-No, you're supposed to use salt.

819
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:46,345
It's sugar.

820
00:46:46,428 --> 00:46:47,596
SUGAR

821
00:46:47,679 --> 00:46:49,556
-You know how it is.
-That's right.

822
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:53,352
TEAM SUGAR

823
00:46:53,435 --> 00:46:55,103
It's sugar only. No salt.

824
00:46:55,187 --> 00:46:56,772
Salt doesn't make it better.

825
00:46:57,397 --> 00:46:58,774
It's better with salt, right?

826
00:46:58,857 --> 00:47:01,109
TEAM SALT

827
00:47:01,193 --> 00:47:03,028
No, it's sugar. That's the only way.

828
00:47:03,111 --> 00:47:05,489
There's a sweet taste
that fills your mouth.

829
00:47:05,572 --> 00:47:07,366
Salt makes it nice and savory.

830
00:47:07,449 --> 00:47:09,076
-Seriously, salt?
-Yes, salt.

831
00:47:09,159 --> 00:47:11,995
SUGAR: 2
SALT: 3

832
00:47:12,538 --> 00:47:14,248
Salt makes it bland.

833
00:47:14,331 --> 00:47:16,583
-No, sugar makes it bland.
-I agree.

834
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:21,088
HE JUST WANTS A BITE

835
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:23,131
SEES HIM

836
00:47:23,215 --> 00:47:24,258
Open wide.

837
00:47:24,841 --> 00:47:26,843
-It's really good and sweet.
-Holy cow.

838
00:47:34,685 --> 00:47:35,978
It's like he ate a live octopus.

839
00:47:36,061 --> 00:47:38,146
LIVE OCTOPUS

840
00:47:38,897 --> 00:47:40,023
The color is similar, too.

841
00:47:40,107 --> 00:47:41,775
LICKS

842
00:47:41,858 --> 00:47:42,985
Sugar is the way to go.

843
00:47:43,068 --> 00:47:44,736
It's good, right? It's the sugar.

844
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:45,779
SUGAR'S BETTER, RIGHT?

845
00:47:46,363 --> 00:47:48,740
-Sugar isn't bad.
-Always go with sugar.

846
00:47:51,702 --> 00:47:53,328
-Is it good?
-Here, try some.

847
00:47:53,829 --> 00:47:56,582
GUESTS JOIN THE BATTLE FOR A BITE

848
00:47:56,665 --> 00:47:58,333
Can I try some with my own hand?

849
00:47:58,417 --> 00:48:00,043
FINGERS JOIN THE BATTLE

850
00:48:04,214 --> 00:48:06,216
It's good with salt.

851
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:07,342
This is so good.

852
00:48:07,426 --> 00:48:10,053
TEAM SALT IS GETTING APPROVALS

853
00:48:10,137 --> 00:48:10,971
SUGAR: 3
SALT: 4

854
00:48:11,054 --> 00:48:12,723
SUGAR: 2
SALT: 5

855
00:48:12,806 --> 00:48:14,933
-Salt is better.
-It is, isn't it?

856
00:48:15,017 --> 00:48:15,892
REALLY?

857
00:48:16,852 --> 00:48:18,687
-Is this salt?
-Yes.

858
00:48:18,770 --> 00:48:19,771
CURIOUS ABOUT SALT

859
00:48:21,273 --> 00:48:22,983
FIDGETS

860
00:48:23,066 --> 00:48:26,194
But is it okay if I use my fingers?

861
00:48:26,278 --> 00:48:27,613
Yes, it's fine.

862
00:48:31,575 --> 00:48:33,660
GOBBLES

863
00:48:38,624 --> 00:48:39,750
Salt is better.

864
00:48:41,001 --> 00:48:44,630
I was confused for a bit.
I'm definitely Team Salt.

865
00:48:44,713 --> 00:48:45,547
SUGAR: 2
SALT: 5

866
00:48:45,631 --> 00:48:47,758
SUGAR: 1
SALT: 6

867
00:48:47,841 --> 00:48:50,218
Here, try it with sugar again.

868
00:48:50,302 --> 00:48:51,511
-Don't trust him.
-Take this.

869
00:48:51,595 --> 00:48:52,846
Don't put your fingers in mine.

870
00:48:52,929 --> 00:48:54,473
-No?
-Just take it.

871
00:48:54,556 --> 00:48:56,642
-That hurts my feelings.
-Not your fingers.

872
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:01,897
Be honest. Salt's better, right?

873
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:03,273
No, sugar is better.

874
00:49:06,943 --> 00:49:08,320
You know what it's like?

875
00:49:08,403 --> 00:49:10,364
Like choosing
between thick crust and thin crust.

876
00:49:10,447 --> 00:49:11,740
I can't decide.

877
00:49:11,823 --> 00:49:13,742
-It depends on your mood.
-It does.

878
00:49:15,243 --> 00:49:16,370
Let me have some more.

879
00:49:16,453 --> 00:49:17,371
BUT I PREFER SALT

880
00:49:20,582 --> 00:49:22,626
Stop putting your fingers
in people's bowls!

881
00:49:22,709 --> 00:49:25,545
-He said it was okay.
-I said it was fine.

882
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:27,506
Min-seob and I did it already!

883
00:49:27,589 --> 00:49:29,091
I think you should clarify "did it."

884
00:49:29,174 --> 00:49:31,301
Right, we put our hands in the same bowl.

885
00:49:31,385 --> 00:49:33,387
JUST OUR HANDS

886
00:49:36,473 --> 00:49:37,474
They did it already.

887
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:50,112
He even put on a show for us.

888
00:49:50,946 --> 00:49:52,322
You know what?

889
00:49:52,406 --> 00:49:54,074
It keeps getting saltier.

890
00:49:54,741 --> 00:49:56,368
That's so gross!

891
00:49:56,451 --> 00:49:58,787
It feels like I'm growing in number.

892
00:49:58,870 --> 00:50:00,205
It feels weird.

893
00:50:00,706 --> 00:50:02,207
This is how we bond.

894
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:05,335
Let's head upstairs.

895
00:50:05,419 --> 00:50:07,838
-The dining hall closes at 9 p.m.
-We're closed.

896
00:50:07,921 --> 00:50:10,090
Is this what you wanted to do?

897
00:50:11,341 --> 00:50:13,260
-Sweet.
-Young people know how to have fun.

898
00:50:13,343 --> 00:50:15,470
-Gen Z.
-The youngsters.

899
00:50:15,554 --> 00:50:17,597
It feels like we're inside a pirate ship.

900
00:50:17,681 --> 00:50:19,349
-It's pretty.
-It is.

901
00:50:19,433 --> 00:50:20,809
This works as a disco ball, too.

902
00:50:20,892 --> 00:50:22,060
Kind of like…

903
00:50:23,854 --> 00:50:25,897
-That's awesome.
-It's amazing, right?

904
00:50:25,981 --> 00:50:27,149
I wanted to use it here…

905
00:50:27,232 --> 00:50:29,943
YE-EUN BOUGHT IT HERSELF
TO USE AT KIAN'S B&B

906
00:50:30,026 --> 00:50:32,279
This takes me back to the early 2000s

907
00:50:32,362 --> 00:50:34,781
when there were cigarette burns
on the seats in karaoke bars.

908
00:50:34,865 --> 00:50:36,074
Cigarettes?

909
00:50:36,158 --> 00:50:37,659
A KIAN-STYLE THOUGHT

910
00:50:37,743 --> 00:50:40,078
-An old karaoke bar.
-The kind that stinks.

911
00:50:40,162 --> 00:50:42,497
Being here makes it somehow feel

912
00:50:43,165 --> 00:50:46,168
as if I'm in a different world
where time doesn't pass.

913
00:50:46,251 --> 00:50:50,839
If we were to go back right now,
it'd feel like waking up from a dream.

914
00:50:51,423 --> 00:50:52,966
I think so, too.

915
00:50:53,049 --> 00:50:54,593
We feel the same way after shooting.

916
00:50:54,676 --> 00:50:56,219
It's like waking from a dream.

917
00:50:56,303 --> 00:50:59,139
When it's over, I feel empty inside.

918
00:50:59,765 --> 00:51:01,266
I feel that way when I lie in bed

919
00:51:01,349 --> 00:51:02,809
-after a concert.
-I can see that.

920
00:51:04,895 --> 00:51:07,731
But why is that?
Fans cheer you on at concerts.

921
00:51:07,814 --> 00:51:09,733
One minute, I hear all this cheering.

922
00:51:09,816 --> 00:51:11,735
The next minute, it's gone.

923
00:51:11,818 --> 00:51:14,321
-So when you go home…
-You'd feel empty.

924
00:51:14,404 --> 00:51:16,198
It just disappears.

925
00:51:16,281 --> 00:51:20,368
On top of that, my ears keep ringing
because the audio is so loud.

926
00:51:20,452 --> 00:51:23,079
I'll be in bed,
but I hear a high-pitched buzz.

927
00:51:24,623 --> 00:51:26,166
It lasts for 30 minutes to an hour.

928
00:51:26,249 --> 00:51:27,584
I can see that happening.

929
00:51:28,335 --> 00:51:29,544
Can we block this entry?

930
00:51:30,128 --> 00:51:32,547
Right, it might be too loud for the kids.

931
00:51:32,631 --> 00:51:34,424
THE HA BROTHERS ARE GETTING READY FOR BED

932
00:51:34,508 --> 00:51:36,760
FIRST SLEEPERS ON THE FIRST FLOOR

933
00:51:36,843 --> 00:51:38,428
Chill out.

934
00:51:39,763 --> 00:51:41,097
Chill out.

935
00:51:42,098 --> 00:51:43,433
I'm turning off the lights.

936
00:51:43,517 --> 00:51:45,018
Okay.

937
00:51:45,101 --> 00:51:47,354
Sleeping like this isn't bad.

938
00:51:47,437 --> 00:51:49,105
It's more comfortable than I thought.

939
00:51:49,189 --> 00:51:51,149
BARRACKS-STYLE SLEEPING ISN'T BAD

940
00:51:51,775 --> 00:51:53,693
You two must be exhausted from today.

941
00:51:54,361 --> 00:51:56,238
It's already the last day.

942
00:51:56,321 --> 00:51:58,907
I really liked the climbing part.

943
00:51:58,990 --> 00:52:00,700
We can do that in the morning.

944
00:52:00,784 --> 00:52:01,993
Give me a kiss.

945
00:52:02,828 --> 00:52:03,954
You too, Dam.

946
00:52:04,788 --> 00:52:05,789
Good night.

947
00:52:06,373 --> 00:52:10,377
The kids have to sleep,
so we set up some lights out front.

948
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:11,878
Let's continue there.

949
00:52:11,962 --> 00:52:13,463
-Outside?
-Sounds good.

950
00:52:13,547 --> 00:52:14,589
There's a nice breeze.

951
00:52:15,215 --> 00:52:19,469
-Sir, we're going to head downstairs.
-Okay.

952
00:52:19,553 --> 00:52:23,056
-Will that help the kids go to sleep?
-Yes, I think so.

953
00:52:23,139 --> 00:52:25,058
-I'm sorry about this, sir.
-No, not at all.

954
00:52:25,141 --> 00:52:27,435
-I'll be out soon.
-You've been so busy with the kids.

955
00:52:28,144 --> 00:52:30,814
-Can we use this as a table?
-That's a great idea.

956
00:52:30,897 --> 00:52:32,232
There's a romantic vibe.

957
00:52:32,774 --> 00:52:34,901
-It's so romantic.
-The lighting is awesome, right?

958
00:52:34,985 --> 00:52:37,362
Ye-eun, I set up these lights myself.

959
00:52:37,445 --> 00:52:38,321
Really?

960
00:52:43,994 --> 00:52:48,748
-All of this was made by Ah-jin.
-I know, right?

961
00:52:48,832 --> 00:52:51,501
Isn't this area amazing?

962
00:52:52,085 --> 00:52:54,462
I think it'll be good for all the guests

963
00:52:54,546 --> 00:52:57,632
-to spend time like this before leaving.
-I like that idea.

964
00:52:57,716 --> 00:52:59,301
I really don't want to go home.

965
00:52:59,801 --> 00:53:01,177
Really? Why is that?

966
00:53:01,761 --> 00:53:06,182
You know how Jin talked
about waking up from a dream?

967
00:53:06,266 --> 00:53:07,601
I feel the same way.

968
00:53:07,684 --> 00:53:09,311
That's exactly it.

969
00:53:09,853 --> 00:53:12,314
I think that's…

970
00:53:12,397 --> 00:53:15,150
That's the best compliment ever.

971
00:53:15,734 --> 00:53:19,404
You looked a bit stressed at times,
but it was really fun for me.

972
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:24,326
Seriously though,
where would you have such experiences?

973
00:53:24,868 --> 00:53:26,119
When would I sleep on a boat?

974
00:53:26,202 --> 00:53:28,455
-Exactly.
-On a barge, no less.

975
00:53:28,538 --> 00:53:30,248
-This boat is special.
-When else?

976
00:53:30,332 --> 00:53:32,542
There is no such thing as inside.

977
00:53:32,626 --> 00:53:34,169
You're so right.

978
00:53:34,252 --> 00:53:37,464
When you open your eyes,
you see the ocean and mountains.

979
00:53:48,516 --> 00:53:49,517
It's a unique experience.

980
00:53:51,937 --> 00:53:54,522
I don't want to wake up
from this dream either.

981
00:53:55,106 --> 00:53:56,691
What's that?

982
00:53:56,775 --> 00:53:57,901
-Why?
-I saw a shooting star!

983
00:53:57,984 --> 00:53:58,818
Really?

984
00:53:58,902 --> 00:54:00,070
-Where?
-Just right now.

985
00:54:02,197 --> 00:54:03,114
What's that?

986
00:54:03,615 --> 00:54:04,574
What's that?

987
00:54:05,158 --> 00:54:07,285
-Why?
-I saw a shooting star!

988
00:54:07,369 --> 00:54:08,411
Really?

989
00:54:14,334 --> 00:54:15,835
-Mr. Ha is here.
-Hello, sir.

990
00:54:15,919 --> 00:54:17,253
We just saw a shooting star.

991
00:54:17,337 --> 00:54:19,172
Really? You can see that?

992
00:54:19,255 --> 00:54:21,466
-I haven't seen one in ages.
-The sky is so clear here.

993
00:54:21,549 --> 00:54:22,509
Oh, gosh!

994
00:54:22,592 --> 00:54:24,177
-You don't drink, right?
-No.

995
00:54:24,678 --> 00:54:25,929
I stopped drinking.

996
00:54:26,513 --> 00:54:29,057
-Get him something else, then.
-Yes, this is good.

997
00:54:29,683 --> 00:54:31,351
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

998
00:54:32,018 --> 00:54:34,562
Mr. Ha, come sit here. I'll move over.

999
00:54:35,230 --> 00:54:37,482
INVITES HIM TO SIT ON THE GROUND

1000
00:54:39,234 --> 00:54:41,611
-Sorry for being so late.
-Not at all.

1001
00:54:41,695 --> 00:54:43,113
-Are the kids sleeping?
-Yes.

1002
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:46,908
I haven't had a chance
to talk to you much.

1003
00:54:46,992 --> 00:54:47,867
Right.

1004
00:54:48,576 --> 00:54:49,452
Is that a beverage?

1005
00:54:49,536 --> 00:54:50,745
-Yes, it is.
-Cheers.

1006
00:54:50,829 --> 00:54:52,288
-It'll have to do then.
-Cheers.

1007
00:54:52,789 --> 00:54:54,249
CHEERS, EVERYONE

1008
00:54:56,084 --> 00:54:57,627
I can't drink sitting like this.

1009
00:55:01,589 --> 00:55:03,883
-You'll remember me, right?
-Of course.

1010
00:55:05,051 --> 00:55:06,052
Watch me on TV.

1011
00:55:06,136 --> 00:55:09,389
I'll watch SNL Korea every day.
I'll watch the full episodes.

1012
00:55:10,682 --> 00:55:11,516
Thank you.

1013
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:15,603
You suddenly became popular
with your comedy acting.

1014
00:55:15,687 --> 00:55:20,859
I was wondering if you were afraid
of being typecast like that.

1015
00:55:20,942 --> 00:55:22,318
I wanted to make people laugh.

1016
00:55:23,528 --> 00:55:25,947
I loved it when people
watched me and laughed.

1017
00:55:26,614 --> 00:55:30,035
So, I decided to go into comedy acting.

1018
00:55:30,118 --> 00:55:32,912
I was a no-name actor for a long time.

1019
00:55:32,996 --> 00:55:34,581
I was willing to be typecast.

1020
00:55:34,664 --> 00:55:35,582
-You wanted that.
-Yes.

1021
00:55:35,665 --> 00:55:38,043
I'm a pretty cheerful person.

1022
00:55:39,753 --> 00:55:43,298
But I went through some really dark times.

1023
00:55:44,007 --> 00:55:47,093
-Things got too hard for you--
-It never rains, but it pours.

1024
00:55:47,177 --> 00:55:48,511
You're so right.

1025
00:55:48,595 --> 00:55:50,138
-Bad things happen all at once.
-Right?

1026
00:55:50,221 --> 00:55:51,139
I agree.

1027
00:55:53,224 --> 00:55:55,643
When you look
at office workers these days…

1028
00:55:55,727 --> 00:55:57,604
In Korean age, I'm 44 years old.

1029
00:55:57,687 --> 00:56:00,065
-You're three years older than me.
-Right.

1030
00:56:00,148 --> 00:56:02,817
I had a regular office job for 18 years.

1031
00:56:03,401 --> 00:56:04,944
I used to love drinking, too.

1032
00:56:05,695 --> 00:56:08,364
I used to love drinking
and hanging out with friends.

1033
00:56:09,324 --> 00:56:11,743
But then all of a sudden…

1034
00:56:12,494 --> 00:56:15,038
Basically, there was blood in my stool.

1035
00:56:15,121 --> 00:56:16,915
-You, sir?
-Yes.

1036
00:56:17,582 --> 00:56:20,835
The reason I no longer drink

1037
00:56:20,919 --> 00:56:24,130
is because I was diagnosed
with rectal cancer three years ago.

1038
00:56:24,714 --> 00:56:27,008
-Really?
-Yes, so that's why…

1039
00:56:28,676 --> 00:56:31,137
Are you okay now?

1040
00:56:31,221 --> 00:56:32,222
Right now,

1041
00:56:32,305 --> 00:56:37,811
regarding my rectal cancer,
I'm basically in remission.

1042
00:56:37,894 --> 00:56:39,896
-That's a relief.
-Right.

1043
00:56:39,979 --> 00:56:41,564
Hold on a minute.

1044
00:56:41,648 --> 00:56:43,191
Since people are chatting here,

1045
00:56:43,274 --> 00:56:46,027
-shall we continue in the sleeping area?
-Sure.

1046
00:56:46,569 --> 00:56:48,363
Let's head inside first.

1047
00:56:48,446 --> 00:56:49,656
-Really?
-Yes.

1048
00:56:49,739 --> 00:56:50,949
You're going in already?

1049
00:56:51,032 --> 00:56:53,368
-I want to talk to Mr. Ha.
-Okay.

1050
00:56:56,496 --> 00:56:57,747
I mean…

1051
00:56:57,831 --> 00:57:00,208
How are you doing right now?

1052
00:57:01,084 --> 00:57:02,585
It's been one thing after another.

1053
00:57:03,086 --> 00:57:04,671
I ended up with lung cancer, too.

1054
00:57:05,255 --> 00:57:06,714
Then…

1055
00:57:06,798 --> 00:57:10,343
Because it spread throughout my body,
I was diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer.

1056
00:57:13,054 --> 00:57:15,140
But do the kids…

1057
00:57:15,223 --> 00:57:16,057
Is it okay to ask?

1058
00:57:16,141 --> 00:57:18,434
-So the kids--
-They do know

1059
00:57:18,518 --> 00:57:20,520
that their dad is sick in a way.

1060
00:57:21,271 --> 00:57:23,898
A while back, my youngest asked me,

1061
00:57:23,982 --> 00:57:27,527
"What's pancreatic cancer, Dad?
Can you die from it?"

1062
00:57:28,403 --> 00:57:29,863
I said, "Why do you ask?"

1063
00:57:30,613 --> 00:57:33,658
And he was like, "Yoo Sang-chul,
the soccer player, passed away from it."

1064
00:57:33,741 --> 00:57:36,453
So that's when I realized

1065
00:57:36,536 --> 00:57:39,164
that the kids might be afraid
when they hear the word cancer

1066
00:57:39,247 --> 00:57:43,334
because they might
automatically associate it with death.

1067
00:57:43,418 --> 00:57:47,046
So I haven't been able to tell them
what my illness is specifically.

1068
00:57:50,884 --> 00:57:54,804
-So the kids don't know exactly…
-No, but…

1069
00:57:54,888 --> 00:58:00,268
Even if the kids find out about this
through this show…

1070
00:58:05,857 --> 00:58:08,735
You must be concerned
about the kids getting shocked.

1071
00:58:08,818 --> 00:58:11,362
They'll probably be shocked,

1072
00:58:11,446 --> 00:58:14,991
but they need to know
why I'm spending this time with them.

1073
00:58:15,783 --> 00:58:16,993
-Don't you think?
-Right.

1074
00:58:17,076 --> 00:58:19,287
I think they should know.

1075
00:58:20,663 --> 00:58:25,502
If I get a lot of time with them,
I'd be very thankful.

1076
00:58:28,421 --> 00:58:31,925
But just in case,
if I get less time than expected…

1077
00:58:34,844 --> 00:58:39,057
The most important thing
is spending time with my kids

1078
00:58:39,140 --> 00:58:41,226
and making good memories with them.

1079
00:58:42,352 --> 00:58:44,896
Okay, come here then. Take my hand.

1080
00:58:45,772 --> 00:58:47,190
It's okay.

1081
00:58:50,777 --> 00:58:54,113
-Can you see my love for you?
-I think I actually see it over there.

1082
00:58:56,908 --> 00:58:57,825
What's going on?

1083
00:58:57,909 --> 00:58:59,911
-My shorts are…
-Good job.

1084
00:58:59,994 --> 00:59:02,789
This isn't fair.

1085
00:59:02,872 --> 00:59:03,873
Have a drink.

1086
00:59:09,337 --> 00:59:12,382
I really didn't expect
to see any families here,

1087
00:59:12,465 --> 00:59:15,093
-so when you came…
-Yes?

1088
00:59:15,176 --> 00:59:19,764
That's why I thought
I should have a chat with you.

1089
00:59:19,847 --> 00:59:21,558
But Mr. Ha…

1090
00:59:22,433 --> 00:59:24,727
Why are you sick?

1091
00:59:25,478 --> 00:59:26,980
Why do you have to be sick?

1092
00:59:27,063 --> 00:59:28,856
Why do you have to be sick?

1093
00:59:29,482 --> 00:59:31,609
-Damn it.
-I feel the same way.

1094
00:59:32,318 --> 00:59:34,404
Please don't be sick.

1095
00:59:34,487 --> 00:59:36,197
I mean, of course…

1096
00:59:41,703 --> 00:59:44,747
My father passed away when I was 26.

1097
00:59:44,831 --> 00:59:47,500
I guess he passed away
after he was done raising me.

1098
00:59:47,584 --> 00:59:48,835
He also had lung cancer.

1099
00:59:50,628 --> 00:59:52,213
He liked to go fishing.

1100
00:59:53,715 --> 00:59:55,341
So, we used to go together.

1101
00:59:55,425 --> 00:59:56,426
But Dad got sick.

1102
00:59:57,260 --> 00:59:58,720
I was 26.

1103
00:59:58,803 --> 01:00:02,056
I wanted to start drawing webtoons,
but I had no money.

1104
01:00:02,140 --> 01:00:03,641
So he gave me some money.

1105
01:00:03,725 --> 01:00:05,393
What really upsets me is…

1106
01:00:05,476 --> 01:00:09,022
I just wanted to repay him
for raising me and…

1107
01:00:12,066 --> 01:00:13,943
It was just bad timing.

1108
01:00:14,027 --> 01:00:15,653
Dad gave me money and…

1109
01:00:16,863 --> 01:00:18,031
And that just…

1110
01:00:18,740 --> 01:00:20,617
All I did was take from him.

1111
01:00:28,333 --> 01:00:29,250
I just…

1112
01:00:30,001 --> 01:00:31,711
But I…

1113
01:00:31,794 --> 01:00:33,254
I don't know.

1114
01:00:33,838 --> 01:00:35,882
Before he passed away,

1115
01:00:36,841 --> 01:00:39,636
he probably spent time with me
by taking me fishing.

1116
01:00:40,303 --> 01:00:42,847
-I think you feel the way he did.
-Even if he didn't say it…

1117
01:00:49,354 --> 01:00:50,355
He just…

1118
01:00:52,357 --> 01:00:53,316
BLOWS HIS NOSE

1119
01:00:53,399 --> 01:00:54,859
Sorry about that.

1120
01:00:56,736 --> 01:00:58,988
It's okay. Is there no tissue?

1121
01:00:59,072 --> 01:01:00,073
Come on.

1122
01:01:00,156 --> 01:01:02,075
-I'm washing this anyway.
-Seriously.

1123
01:01:05,870 --> 01:01:09,582
-You need to beat this for your kids.
-Of course.

1124
01:01:10,124 --> 01:01:14,170
According to the graph, I'm improving.

1125
01:01:15,088 --> 01:01:19,717
If my cancer wasn't getting better
but getting worse instead,

1126
01:01:20,218 --> 01:01:23,304
I think I would've kept
everything to myself

1127
01:01:23,388 --> 01:01:25,014
because it's bad news.

1128
01:01:25,098 --> 01:01:28,267
But my condition
is changing for the better,

1129
01:01:28,351 --> 01:01:30,520
and it actually has improved.

1130
01:01:31,312 --> 01:01:34,273
I'm going through chemotherapy
by taking pills.

1131
01:01:34,857 --> 01:01:38,861
Fortunately, I have a gene that lets me
treat my cancer with pills.

1132
01:01:40,446 --> 01:01:42,657
-So the doctor said--
-What a huge relief.

1133
01:01:42,740 --> 01:01:44,325
The doctor said,

1134
01:01:44,409 --> 01:01:47,829
"You have the gene
that allows for oral chemotherapy.

1135
01:01:47,912 --> 01:01:53,459
So you can enjoy living a healthy life
while taking chemotherapy drugs."

1136
01:01:53,543 --> 01:01:55,253
That's what he told me.

1137
01:01:55,336 --> 01:01:57,630
Instead of staying in a hospital,

1138
01:01:57,714 --> 01:02:01,342
I can spend time with my kids
in places like this.

1139
01:02:01,426 --> 01:02:04,846
How long has it been since then?

1140
01:02:04,929 --> 01:02:07,473
-It's been about two years.
-About two years?

1141
01:02:07,557 --> 01:02:08,516
Right.

1142
01:02:08,599 --> 01:02:10,435
So that's how I've been living

1143
01:02:11,269 --> 01:02:13,146
and fighting this
with a positive attitude.

1144
01:02:15,398 --> 01:02:16,607
-I…
-Yes?

1145
01:02:17,608 --> 01:02:19,277
-I spread positive vibes.
-Really?

1146
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:20,778
I've seen miraculous things

1147
01:02:20,862 --> 01:02:24,407
happen all throughout my life
and around me.

1148
01:02:24,490 --> 01:02:25,575
But that's…

1149
01:02:26,993 --> 01:02:28,119
That's impossible.

1150
01:02:28,703 --> 01:02:30,830
Or maybe it is. Maybe it's possible.

1151
01:02:30,913 --> 01:02:31,914
Of course.

1152
01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:37,462
I'll pray to Buddha before I go to bed.

1153
01:02:42,675 --> 01:02:44,051
Dam.

1154
01:02:45,011 --> 01:02:46,220
-Dad?
-Yes?

1155
01:02:46,304 --> 01:02:48,806
-Were you sleeping?
-Yes, I was.

1156
01:02:48,890 --> 01:02:52,226
But then I thought
what was taking you so long.

1157
01:02:52,310 --> 01:02:55,062
-I kept wondering.
-You were waiting up?

1158
01:02:55,146 --> 01:02:57,356
-I'm sorry for making you wait.
-Okay.

1159
01:02:58,065 --> 01:03:01,569
Close your eyes now. I'll be by your side.

1160
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:05,490
I love you very much.

1161
01:03:08,951 --> 01:03:10,453
We're so lucky.

1162
01:03:25,802 --> 01:03:27,637
Look at all of those stars!

1163
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:29,472
I've never seen so many in Korea.

1164
01:03:29,555 --> 01:03:30,973
It's not common.

1165
01:03:31,057 --> 01:03:32,767
There are tons right above our heads.

1166
01:03:39,190 --> 01:03:41,651
I want to see a shooting star.
Have you seen one?

1167
01:03:41,734 --> 01:03:42,735
Did you make a wish?

1168
01:03:42,819 --> 01:03:44,529
It went by too fast, so no.

1169
01:03:48,032 --> 01:03:49,408
You should be used to this by now.

1170
01:03:49,492 --> 01:03:51,828
Customer satisfaction
comes from the little details.

1171
01:03:52,453 --> 01:03:54,121
Let's shake out the blankets today.

1172
01:03:55,456 --> 01:03:56,999
Damn it, Kian84!

1173
01:03:57,583 --> 01:04:00,127
I don't think our boss
is in any state to do it.

1174
01:04:00,211 --> 01:04:01,045
What do we do?

1175
01:04:01,128 --> 01:04:02,296
I don't feel good.

1176
01:04:02,380 --> 01:04:03,756
It's time to pick up the guests.

1177
01:04:04,340 --> 01:04:05,508
It's Kian's B&B without Kian.

1178
01:04:05,591 --> 01:04:07,552
-Let's battle it out.
-Get up here!

1179
01:04:07,635 --> 01:04:09,262
Let's play in the pool with the guests.

1180
01:04:09,345 --> 01:04:10,763
This is reassuring.

1181
01:04:11,931 --> 01:04:14,183
-What's the matter with him?
-He's an odd duck.

1182
01:04:14,267 --> 01:04:16,310
Boss, what are you doing?

1183
01:04:16,394 --> 01:04:17,645
You're putting it in there?

1184
01:04:18,271 --> 01:04:20,356
The first and second groups
are very different.

1185
01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:25,027
The god of Ulleungdo Island
provides us with answers!

1186
01:04:25,111 --> 01:04:27,572
Now, this is the god of Ulleungdo Island!

1187
01:04:28,364 --> 01:04:32,535
KIAN'S BIZARRE B&B
