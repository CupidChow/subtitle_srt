00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:32,991
BOW

5
00:00:33,575 --> 00:00:35,785
TIDYING UP THE BLANKET AGAIN TODAY

6
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:37,037
KI-HONG PASSES BY

00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:42,292
YE-EUN PASSES BY

8
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:44,127
Let's go.

9
00:00:47,672 --> 00:00:50,175
WHERE ARE THEY GOING?

10
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:53,887
THE OWNER IS STILL OUT COLD

11
00:00:56,806 --> 00:00:58,391
Where's your student?

12
00:00:58,475 --> 00:00:59,350
STUDENT?

13
00:00:59,434 --> 00:01:00,602
I think that's her.

14
00:01:01,811 --> 00:01:02,645
YESTERDAY MORNING

15
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:05,023
Invite them over
and say you'll tutor them here.

16
00:01:05,106 --> 00:01:06,232
That's a great idea.

17
00:01:07,442 --> 00:01:10,111
-Where do they live?
-In Gwangju.

18
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:12,489
That's a stone's throw away
from Ulleungdo Island.

19
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:13,948
What's your student's name?

20
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:15,241
Her name is Oh Chae-won.

21
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:18,036
-Chae-won!
-Chae-won!

22
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:19,245
Hello.

23
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:21,998
THE STUDENT ARRIVES IN ULLEUNGDO ISLAND

24
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:23,374
Hello.

25
00:01:24,834 --> 00:01:26,961
FRESHMAN AT GWANG-JU SCIENCE ACADEMY
OH CHAE-WON

26
00:01:27,545 --> 00:01:30,423
-How do I get down?
-You need a hand? You can step on this.

27
00:01:31,674 --> 00:01:33,593
-Thank you.
-There you go.

28
00:01:33,676 --> 00:01:35,678
It's nice to see you here.

29
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:37,388
-This is our captain.
-Hi there.

30
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:38,431
Nice to meet you.

31
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:39,474
FASCINATED

32
00:01:39,557 --> 00:01:41,226
Let's go.

33
00:01:41,309 --> 00:01:43,436
HEADED TO KIAN'S B&B FOR A LESSON

34
00:01:44,562 --> 00:01:45,814
Ye-eun, take us too.

35
00:01:45,897 --> 00:01:47,106
We're going to Dokdo.

36
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:48,066
Let's go.

37
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:51,027
QUICK SWITCH

38
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:55,573
SURPRISED

39
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:56,491
ALSO SURPRISED

40
00:01:56,574 --> 00:01:57,534
She really came.

41
00:01:58,284 --> 00:02:01,287
-She came here for her lesson.
-I know. I can't believe it.

42
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:04,958
THE OWNER HAS NO IDEA

43
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:06,334
Let me show you around.

44
00:02:06,417 --> 00:02:07,752
GIVES A TOUR INSTEAD OF THE OWNER

45
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:08,837
This is the exit.

46
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,672
Go up here since you're wearing a skirt.

47
00:02:12,882 --> 00:02:14,717
AMAZED

48
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:16,970
Those are the second and third floors.

49
00:02:17,053 --> 00:02:20,223
This is where we enjoy our teatime.

50
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:22,559
This is cool. Gosh, that scared me.

51
00:02:27,772 --> 00:02:28,940
Oh, hello.

52
00:02:29,607 --> 00:02:31,067
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

53
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:32,735
-Oh, hello.
-Who's this?

54
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:34,320
She's my student.

55
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:38,032
You came here for a tutoring session?

56
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:39,826
A tutoring session and a trip.

57
00:02:39,909 --> 00:02:40,994
Really?

58
00:02:41,077 --> 00:02:42,036
NICE TO MEET YOU

59
00:02:42,912 --> 00:02:43,872
-Say hi.
-Hello.

60
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:46,124
-She's a new…
-She's the student.

61
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:47,959
BOWS AGAIN

62
00:02:50,461 --> 00:02:52,338
A TUTORING SESSION ON A BARGE

63
00:02:54,465 --> 00:02:55,884
Can you hold this?

64
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:57,427
You're going to study there?

65
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:59,512
-Good idea.
-Are you sure?

66
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:00,430
I'm not sure.

67
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:01,681
LESSON LOCATION
TEATIME ZONE

68
00:03:01,764 --> 00:03:04,517
I think it should work.
I'll go over there.

69
00:03:13,484 --> 00:03:15,904
-Oh no.
-Did you drop something?

70
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:17,530
I dropped my pen.

71
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:20,450
CATCHES

72
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:22,327
ARE THEY DOING OKAY?

73
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:25,121
You learned about the Bohr model
in chemistry class.

74
00:03:25,204 --> 00:03:27,415
I saw it on AP Bridge.

75
00:03:27,498 --> 00:03:28,333
FLIPS

76
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:30,293
You know this equation?

77
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:31,210
FLIPS AGAIN

78
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:33,880
-In the back…
-The wind is really strong.

79
00:03:35,214 --> 00:03:36,257
We can't do it here.

80
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:38,217
-Really?
-I give up.

81
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:39,886
GIVES UP TEACHING IN THE TEATIME ZONE

82
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:42,555
WHERE SHOULD WE DO THE LESSON?

83
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:46,851
-Do you want to go down?
-It looks mysterious.

84
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:48,394
Just slide down the pole.

85
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:50,605
LESSON LOCATION
FIRST FLOOR KITCHEN

86
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:54,484
Good. You made it.

87
00:03:57,362 --> 00:03:58,404
Great job.

88
00:03:58,488 --> 00:04:00,198
ALL THIS FOR A TUTORING SESSION

89
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:01,699
THE LESSON STARTS FOR REAL

90
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:05,536
Brightness is the amount of energy
released per unit of time.

91
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:07,205
So it's joule per second.

92
00:04:07,288 --> 00:04:09,415
-The unit of energy is joules.
-Yes.

93
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:14,545
Since it's per unit of time,
we divide the joules by unit of time.

94
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:18,424
It's joules per second,
which is basically watts.

95
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:21,135
Flux B is B of 1 over r squared.

96
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:24,597
YE-EUN RETURNS FROM HER SHOWER

97
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:26,933
-Where's Ki-hong?
-He's tutoring downstairs.

98
00:04:27,016 --> 00:04:27,976
Really?

99
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:30,061
-Where is he tutoring?
-Downstairs.

100
00:04:31,145 --> 00:04:33,564
ARE THEY DOING OKAY?

101
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:37,068
Gosh, that scared me.

102
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:40,863
So anyway,
the luminous intensity is S times S.

103
00:04:41,489 --> 00:04:44,284
HIS FOCUS DOES NOT WAVER

104
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:50,248
This is something
we only use for hydrogen.

105
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:55,086
It's the Bohr model of the hydrogen atom.

106
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:58,339
WHY DID HE COME DOWN?

107
00:05:00,341 --> 00:05:01,551
Aren't you cold?

108
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:04,345
ADJUSTS THE TEMPERATURE FOR THEM

109
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:09,559
CAREFULLY TAKES WHAT HE NEEDS

110
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:11,602
-The z is…
-No, this one.

111
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:13,479
First, a nucleon is missing.

112
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:15,356
-I think you need more light.
-Thank you.

113
00:05:16,357 --> 00:05:18,234
THE OWNER CASUALLY TAKES CARE OF THEM

114
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:29,704
THE ENVIRONMENT IS BETTER
ALL THANKS TO THE OWNER

115
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:37,045
HE FINISHES WORKING ON THE SOUVENIRS
FOR THE GUESTS

116
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:38,338
Sung-ho.

117
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:42,050
I have to go back up.

118
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:46,012
HE HAS MEAL TRAYS IN HIS HANDS AGAIN

119
00:05:46,804 --> 00:05:48,931
HOW DO I TAKE IT UP THERE?

120
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:55,897
THINKS HARD

121
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:05,323
PUTS IT IN HIS PANTS

122
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:09,118
SNUG

123
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:15,249
GETTING WARMED UP

124
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:17,627
This is exhausting.

125
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:23,716
ARRIVES SAFELY

126
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:25,301
Sung-ho.

127
00:06:25,384 --> 00:06:27,053
EYES SHAKING

128
00:06:27,136 --> 00:06:29,055
It's the thickest "ho" in the world.

129
00:06:29,138 --> 00:06:31,474
SUNG-HO

130
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:33,684
-Thank you.
-Look at it in the light later.

131
00:06:34,852 --> 00:06:36,687
I drew kongguksu for you, Min-seob.

132
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:38,731
A MEMENTO OF THEIR SHARED KONGGUKSU

133
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:40,691
-Oh, this is incredible.
-He drew that for you?

134
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:42,026
These are our hands.

135
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,569
MIN-SEOB'S HAND, KIAN'S HAND

136
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:45,696
THE LESSON ENDS RIGHT AT THAT TIME

137
00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:49,117
Pack your belongings.

138
00:06:49,867 --> 00:06:52,703
10:30 A.M.
TIME FOR EVERYONE TO CHECK OUT

139
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:55,081
Leave a message on the wall before you go.

140
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:58,251
-Can we leave mean comments?
-Go ahead.

141
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,336
I'll erase it then.

142
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:02,922
You can be totally honest.

143
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:06,509
INSECTS ARE CUTE TOO

144
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:08,678
PHYSICAL STRENGTH IS NATIONAL STRENGTH
MIN-SEOB

145
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:13,641
I like it. It's the world star's spot.

146
00:07:14,892 --> 00:07:16,310
CLIMBING TEAM
TAE-IN

147
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:18,563
TAE-IN WAS HERE
TEAM MAD ROCK, EAT LOTS OF PROTEINS!

148
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:22,483
Kian's B&B gave us the courage
to try the things we wanted to do.

149
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:23,568
KIAN'S B&B IS "COURAGE"

150
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:24,569
CLIMBING TEAM
MIN-JUN

151
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:26,487
Kian's B&B is like
a smell of a belly button.

152
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:28,906
The whole experience
was like eating curry with your hands.

153
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,992
There was something addicting about it.

154
00:07:31,075 --> 00:07:32,076
CLIMBING TEAM MIN-SEOB

155
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,536
Kian's B&B is idyllic.

156
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:36,247
Staying here
was very therapeutic for my mind.

157
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:38,040
Do you want to write one?

158
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:39,125
-Can I?
-Sure.

159
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:41,544
You visited us, so you're our guest.

160
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:43,129
I had my lesson here.

161
00:07:43,212 --> 00:07:44,630
It was brief but fun.

162
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:45,631
TUTEE
CHAE-WON

163
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:48,301
-Let's get going.
-I'm so sad about leaving.

164
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:50,011
Thank you.

165
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:51,637
Thanks for everything.

166
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:53,806
-It was fun.
-What an honor.

167
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:56,017
I had fun.

168
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:58,060
I had so much fun.

169
00:07:58,144 --> 00:07:59,145
-Take care.
-I will.

170
00:07:59,228 --> 00:08:00,855
-Get home safe.
-It was my honor.

171
00:08:02,523 --> 00:08:04,150
I can't believe we're leaving.

172
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:07,695
Goodbye.

173
00:08:07,778 --> 00:08:08,905
Bye!

174
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:10,364
Thanks for the hospitality.

175
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:14,494
Take care!

176
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:15,870
It's been fun.

177
00:08:15,953 --> 00:08:18,122
I wish I could stay one more day.

178
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:19,665
I'm sad.

179
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:21,626
THE KAIST TEAM
KI-HONG

180
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:23,336
KIAN'S B&B IS "YOUTH"

181
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:25,546
It left a lasting impression on me.

182
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:26,839
It was a new experience.

183
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:28,633
THE KAIST TEAM
SUNG-HO

184
00:08:28,716 --> 00:08:30,092
It left a strong impression.

185
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:31,719
KIAN'S B&B IS "IMPRESSIVE"

186
00:08:31,802 --> 00:08:34,764
I don't think I'll ever experience
anything like this.

187
00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:37,433
When will we ever get another chance?

188
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:38,559
Hold on!

189
00:08:39,143 --> 00:08:41,062
I left my card and my phone case.

190
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,357
-Your card?
-My credit card.

191
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,816
-Captain!
-Captain.

192
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,652
-Yes?
-I'm so sorry, but…

193
00:08:47,735 --> 00:08:48,694
He left his card.

194
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:50,613
-What?
-My credit card.

195
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:53,533
-I left it there.
-We should go back.

196
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:57,662
-Kian!
-Yes?

197
00:08:57,745 --> 00:09:00,164
He left his credit card there!

198
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:03,417
He says it's in the blue cabinet!

199
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:04,585
-This one?
-Yes.

200
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,547
Thank you! I'm sorry about that.

201
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,674
We said such a heartfelt goodbye too.

202
00:09:09,757 --> 00:09:11,008
I'm sorry!

203
00:09:14,428 --> 00:09:16,681
-We came to see you once more.
-We missed you already.

204
00:09:16,764 --> 00:09:18,558
Right, I'm too good-looking not to miss.

205
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:20,560
-We won't get to see it ever again.
-Of course.

206
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:21,769
Thank you.

207
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,230
-Take care.
-Okay.

208
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:26,816
-We're really going now.
-Get home safe!

209
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:31,112
CHECKED OUT

210
00:09:31,195 --> 00:09:34,699
THE KAIST TEAM: SUNG-HO, KI-HONG
CLIMBING TEAM: MIN-JUN, TAE-IN, MIN-SEOB

211
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:37,201
11 A.M.

212
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:39,662
IT WAS BUSTLING 10 MINUTES AGO

213
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:43,791
-You can't climb up?
-Do you see this?

214
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:53,050
NOW KIAN'S B&B IS EMPTY

215
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:57,805
Everyone's gone.

216
00:10:00,474 --> 00:10:01,559
Let's clean up.

217
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:05,896
I think it'd be a good idea
to start cleaning here.

218
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,315
KIAN'S B&B CLEANUP
1. YARD

219
00:10:18,826 --> 00:10:20,494
TAKING OUT THE TRASH

220
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:36,886
THE EXTRA WOOD AH-JIN LEFT BEHIND

221
00:10:44,935 --> 00:10:46,437
It's so quiet.

222
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,855
KIAN'S B&B CLEANUP
1. YARD

223
00:10:47,938 --> 00:10:49,273
2. SECOND FLOOR

224
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:51,150
We should label the rags.

225
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:53,277
-Should we write it down?
-Yes.

226
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:56,113
-Should I write it here?
-Let's mark it.

227
00:10:57,406 --> 00:11:00,743
MARKING THE RAGS

228
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:02,244
-Maybe four?
-Okay.

229
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:03,287
Yes.

230
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:08,334
RAG

231
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:09,960
-It's two G's, right?
-Yeah.

232
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:12,880
-It's two G's, right?
-Yeah.

233
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:16,008
RAGG

234
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:18,219
Wait, isn't it one G?

235
00:11:19,303 --> 00:11:20,429
You said it has two G's.

236
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:22,348
But I wrote it with one G.

237
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:23,641
RAGG

238
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:26,060
-But you just said…
-Which one is correct?

239
00:11:26,143 --> 00:11:27,228
Try writing one G.

240
00:11:29,313 --> 00:11:31,357
There should be two. That looks wrong.

241
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:33,275
What do I do?

242
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:34,902
I'm going to look so dumb.

243
00:11:34,985 --> 00:11:37,696
RAG

244
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:39,323
Let's go wash them.

245
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:41,492
THEY GO TO WASH THE RAGGS

246
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:46,497
That's enough.

247
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:10,479
I'll scrub first.

248
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:15,526
CLEANS WITH A WET RAG

249
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:23,367
Hidden areas here need to be cleaned.

250
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:26,495
Customer satisfaction
comes from the little details.

251
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:45,681
CLEANS THE BEDS

252
00:13:04,658 --> 00:13:07,119
THEY FINISH TIDYING UP THE SLIPPERS

253
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:10,664
THE SECOND FLOOR IS ALL DONE

254
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:15,753
KIAN'S B&B CLEANUP
2. SECOND FLOOR

255
00:13:15,836 --> 00:13:18,255
3. RECYCLE

256
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:29,391
KIAN'S B&B CLEANUP
3. RECYCLE

257
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:32,061
4. BATHROOM

258
00:13:37,691 --> 00:13:39,568
Damn, someone already…

259
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:51,455
Oh, gosh. This is very graphic.

260
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:07,012
YESTERDAY

261
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:09,723
WIPED WITH HIS FEET

262
00:14:10,724 --> 00:14:13,602
HE'S USING TOOLS TODAY

263
00:14:20,734 --> 00:14:23,696
MUCH CLEANER

264
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:30,494
THE BATHROOM IS ALL DONE

265
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:37,167
The dishes are already done.

266
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:40,296
YE-EUN LAST NIGHT

267
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:42,298
CLEARED

268
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:44,967
Since there are three of us…

269
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:48,679
-When are we having lunch?
-Right now.

270
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:51,098
-What are we having?
-Noodles.

271
00:14:51,181 --> 00:14:52,808
THE LUNCH MENU IS NOODLES

272
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:57,605
I'll need squash, noodles, and onions.

273
00:14:58,939 --> 00:15:01,275
We only have pork belly.

274
00:15:01,358 --> 00:15:04,069
PORK BELLY WILL BE THE GARNISH

275
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:17,791
BOILS PORK BELLY

276
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:20,336
ADDS THE VEGETABLES TOO

277
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:32,431
ONCE THE NOODLES ARE COOKED

278
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:34,183
THEY GET A COLD SHOWER

279
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:42,816
PORK BELLY AS THE GARNISH

280
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:46,278
POURS THE BROTH ON TOP

281
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:47,738
There we go.

282
00:15:48,572 --> 00:15:50,449
I'll put the kimchi in the middle.

283
00:15:50,532 --> 00:15:52,534
JIN'S MEAT NOODLES

284
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:05,673
SAFETY FIRST WHEN CLIMBING

285
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:08,467
DO NOT CLIMB WHILE DRUNK

286
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:10,302
PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT

287
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:17,810
CHILDREN MUST BE ACOMPANIED BY AN ADULT

288
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:20,270
ACOMPANIED

289
00:16:21,605 --> 00:16:22,815
Should it be two C's?

290
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:24,525
Jin!

291
00:16:25,567 --> 00:16:27,319
-Jin!
-Yes?

292
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:31,615
-How do you spell "accompanied"?
-It's two C's.

293
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:33,242
Damn it.

294
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:37,705
I'm such an idiot.

295
00:16:38,622 --> 00:16:39,915
I always do this.

296
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:43,377
I always misspelled words
even when I drew webtoons.

297
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:47,381
It's true.
He had a lot of typos in his work.

298
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:52,302
ACCOMPANIED

299
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:55,139
-Should we eat now?
-Yeah.

300
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:00,310
Something smells good.

301
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:03,105
I'm starving to death.

302
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:05,315
Hurry. The noodles are getting mushy.

303
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:11,947
-You're getting better at this.
-Yeah.

304
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:12,906
That looks good.

305
00:17:14,783 --> 00:17:16,702
You can crush dried seaweed and add it in.

306
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:18,746
-And take some of this.
-Okay.

307
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:19,663
SAUCE

308
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:22,249
That's the sauce. You put that on top.

309
00:17:22,332 --> 00:17:25,461
TAKES A GENEROUS AMOUNT

310
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:31,925
It's delicious.

311
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:34,762
-You have to add this.
-This is good.

312
00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:37,306
ADDS KIMCHI ON TOP

313
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:41,560
This is different
from the Jeju Island meat noodles.

314
00:17:49,693 --> 00:17:51,320
This is all that's left of our kimchi.

315
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:53,697
Tonight's dinner…

316
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:55,199
TONIGHT'S DINNER
JJAJANG OVER RICE

317
00:17:55,282 --> 00:17:57,951
We can add the leftover pork belly.

318
00:17:58,035 --> 00:17:59,078
Should I wash the clothes?

319
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:00,913
The water basin is really heavy.

320
00:18:00,996 --> 00:18:04,500
Add a little detergent
and step on the laundry.

321
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:08,128
We could wash them with our feet
and hang them out to dry in the sun.

322
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:10,506
-That was great, Jin.
-Thanks for the meal.

323
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:14,426
I'm worried.
How am I going to get up there?

324
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:22,601
That really helps. Keep that up.

325
00:18:23,143 --> 00:18:25,187
-That's great.
-Really?

326
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:27,314
-It gives you a lot of support.
-It does?

327
00:18:27,397 --> 00:18:28,565
Step on my shoulders.

328
00:18:30,734 --> 00:18:32,653
-Here I go.
-One, two.

329
00:18:33,153 --> 00:18:35,072
-Here I go.
-One, two.

330
00:18:35,572 --> 00:18:36,865
Move your arms up.

331
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:41,078
-Hey, you'll bump your head like that.
-That hurts!

332
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:42,579
Are you okay?

333
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:43,956
Get up here.

334
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:46,083
-My head hurts.
-Come up.

335
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:47,209
Come up more.

336
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:48,961
-Don't let go.
-Come up more.

337
00:18:49,044 --> 00:18:51,421
-There you go. Well done.
-Okay.

338
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:54,299
-Is your head okay?
-It hurts.

339
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:57,219
You should have straightened your back.

340
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:01,223
You don't say.

341
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:05,060
You should be used to this by now.

342
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:06,186
I can't get used to it.

343
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:08,939
-Can you come up, Boss?
-I have to go up.

344
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:12,276
-Can you come up, Boss?
-I have to go up.

345
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:14,444
I have to go up.

346
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:17,364
HIS WAY OF STORING THINGS

347
00:19:24,454 --> 00:19:25,914
What do we have to do again?

348
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,584
-Laundry.
-Is that right?

349
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:29,751
Cleaning and laundry.

350
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:37,467
Why did I build the house like this?

351
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:39,469
I should've left it as an imagination.

352
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:42,431
Is this all the laundry?

353
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:44,850
THESE LAUNDRY ARE

354
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:47,186
THE TOWELS THE GUESTS HAVE USED

355
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:51,231
LET'S WASH THE TOWELS

356
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:57,070
And my clothes too.

357
00:19:57,154 --> 00:19:58,697
PLUS MY CLOTHES

358
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,115
I should air these out.

359
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:03,785
AND THESE ARE

360
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:06,747
THE BLANKETS THE GUESTS HAVE USED

361
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,458
LET'S SHAKE OUT THE BLANKETS

362
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:24,765
-Do you need help?
-Nice timing. Hold the other end.

363
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:29,394
Hey, just hold it.

364
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:32,522
Hey, just hold it.

365
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:34,483
-Just hold it for me.
-Okay.

366
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:35,525
Grab tight.

367
00:20:46,036 --> 00:20:50,082
-I said, grab tight!
-Stop trying to be funny.

368
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:52,876
-I'm not!
-You're trying to be funny.

369
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,170
I'm not! This is how you do it.

370
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:58,215
Hold it wider and grab tight this time.

371
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,050
NODS

372
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:09,476
-Stop trying to be funny.
-That's so not true!

373
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:10,852
Seriously!

374
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:14,731
That's enough. Where do we hang it?

375
00:21:15,315 --> 00:21:16,275
Let's put it here.

376
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:18,860
What should we do first?

377
00:21:23,573 --> 00:21:24,825
-Go up and down.
-Okay.

378
00:21:24,908 --> 00:21:25,951
One, two, three.

379
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:30,747
That dust!

380
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:33,417
THESE TWO HAVE DONE THIS BEFORE

381
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,418
You guys are good.

382
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:41,258
-That's enough.
-Stop.

383
00:21:41,758 --> 00:21:43,719
-You two should try.
-Okay.

384
00:21:45,262 --> 00:21:46,930
Let's see if I was wrong.

385
00:21:47,514 --> 00:21:49,182
-Grab the corners.
-Okay.

386
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:51,143
-The corners.
-And tighten your fists.

387
00:21:51,226 --> 00:21:53,145
I should've explained it like that.

388
00:21:53,228 --> 00:21:55,689
One, two, three.

389
00:21:55,772 --> 00:21:56,982
One, two, three.

390
00:21:57,065 --> 00:21:58,108
Three…

391
00:21:58,692 --> 00:21:59,526
GETTING FRUSTRATED

392
00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:00,819
Got it?

393
00:22:00,902 --> 00:22:01,903
-Dang it.
-Got it?

394
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:03,238
-Yes.
-One, two, three.

395
00:22:07,534 --> 00:22:09,202
CHAOTIC

396
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,251
IT'S HILARIOUS TO WATCH THEM

397
00:22:16,918 --> 00:22:19,212
Here. That's it.

398
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,341
You and Jin should shake out the rest.

399
00:22:22,924 --> 00:22:28,305
SPENT 10 MINUTES TO SHAKE OUT THE BLANKETS

400
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:30,724
ENERGY DRAINED

401
00:22:30,807 --> 00:22:31,975
Let's do the laundry.

402
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:41,068
WASHES HIS FACE FIRST

403
00:22:42,277 --> 00:22:43,945
Wash your feet.

404
00:22:45,405 --> 00:22:52,037
WASHES FEET THOROUGHLY WITH SOAP

405
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:57,000
-All done.
-All done.

406
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:06,301
Go ahead and step on them.
I'll go grab a basket.

407
00:23:06,384 --> 00:23:07,719
-But Ye-eun…
-Yeah.

408
00:23:08,512 --> 00:23:09,387
Is this right?

409
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:12,349
Do you think it's right to step on them?

410
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:14,893
Good question. I'm not sure.

411
00:23:14,976 --> 00:23:16,228
They're towels.

412
00:23:16,937 --> 00:23:18,438
Well, we use them too.

413
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:20,440
WE DO USE THEM

414
00:23:20,524 --> 00:23:21,650
I'm fine with it.

415
00:23:22,317 --> 00:23:23,276
Me too.

416
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:29,908
Should we start?

417
00:23:33,703 --> 00:23:34,704
Are you sure?

418
00:23:36,456 --> 00:23:38,291
Should we go to a laundromat instead?

419
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:46,716
Boss, I'm stepping on them right now,
but is this okay?

420
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:49,344
In India…

421
00:23:49,427 --> 00:23:50,303
BUT THIS IS KOREA

422
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:51,638
We're not from India.

423
00:23:51,721 --> 00:23:53,640
Foot laundry is common in Korea.

424
00:23:54,349 --> 00:23:56,351
But isn't that usually for blankets?

425
00:23:56,434 --> 00:23:58,603
No, they do it
to wash everything else too.

426
00:23:58,687 --> 00:23:59,729
-Yeah?
-Really?

427
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:02,149
Look up "foot laundry for towels" online.

428
00:24:02,232 --> 00:24:05,902
I guess we should check
since hygiene is important these days.

429
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:06,987
One moment.

430
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:12,826
It says it could be unhygienic
to wash your towels with your feet.

431
00:24:12,909 --> 00:24:15,662
"There is a lot of sweat, germs,
and dust on our feet,

432
00:24:15,745 --> 00:24:19,541
so you can contaminate your towels further
if you wash them with your feet."

433
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:21,710
-Should've looked it up.
-"If your feet aren't clean,

434
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:24,421
germs and odors could remain,
making them unhygienic."

435
00:24:24,504 --> 00:24:27,591
HE KNOWS THEY'RE SCREWED

436
00:24:27,674 --> 00:24:30,719
-It's about hygiene, so we'll use these.
-Okay.

437
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:33,096
-Let's wash them with our hands.
-Yeah.

438
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,347
Grab one, guys.

439
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:36,349
THEY'LL HAND-WASH THEM AND USE THEM

440
00:24:38,727 --> 00:24:39,936
Give me the soap.

441
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:50,614
-Should we make the guests wash their own?
-Yes.

442
00:24:52,115 --> 00:24:54,826
You have to wash it yourself to be sure.

443
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:57,120
I'm building my muscles here.

444
00:24:57,204 --> 00:24:58,705
I'm in better shape already.

445
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:03,835
IT'S GETTING SUNNIER

446
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:06,004
It's a perfect day for doing the laundry.

447
00:25:06,546 --> 00:25:08,632
-We need to rinse these.
-Yeah.

448
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:10,258
Good.

449
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:16,890
Okay, they're clean now.

450
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:21,186
Shouldn't we hang them up there?

451
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:23,855
I think we should hang them up there.

452
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:24,940
Over there?

453
00:25:28,109 --> 00:25:29,569
-At the very top?
-Yes.

454
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:31,905
-Here or the middle?
-The middle.

455
00:25:35,742 --> 00:25:38,286
-I'm done.
-Okay. Good.

456
00:25:40,914 --> 00:25:41,998
Come here, Ye-eun.

457
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:48,421
Hold tight.

458
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:53,301
-That's enough.
-Okay.

459
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:55,262
Yeah, like that.

460
00:25:57,264 --> 00:25:58,807
These will dry really well.

461
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:01,101
Right? I think so too.

462
00:26:01,184 --> 00:26:04,104
Wait, so do we have some free time?

463
00:26:04,187 --> 00:26:05,021
-Free time?
-Yes.

464
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:06,606
This is our free time.

465
00:26:08,358 --> 00:26:10,026
How is this free time?

466
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:12,070
-Why?
-I haven't had a moment of rest.

467
00:26:12,153 --> 00:26:14,072
-Come sit down.
-You can relax here.

468
00:26:14,155 --> 00:26:16,783
You can sit down and relax.
Grab a chair from there.

469
00:26:19,869 --> 00:26:21,913
LET'S JUST KEEP WORKING

470
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:33,925
DRYING UNDER THE SUN

471
00:26:34,509 --> 00:26:37,512
MEANWHILE, THE HA FAMILY

472
00:26:37,595 --> 00:26:38,805
The sky is so beautiful.

473
00:26:39,806 --> 00:26:43,018
You might never see this again.

474
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:51,693
DOKDO

475
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:57,115
IT TOOK AN HOUR AND A HALF
FROM ULLEUNGDO ISLAND

476
00:26:58,033 --> 00:26:59,034
That's so cool.

477
00:27:06,499 --> 00:27:08,084
-Isn't this amazing?
-Yes.

478
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:20,096
It was worth the trip here.

479
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,431
Hurrah!

480
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:26,644
The water is really clean.

481
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:27,687
It really is.

482
00:27:33,234 --> 00:27:35,570
Is this Dongdo? And that's Seodo?

483
00:27:35,653 --> 00:27:36,946
It's Dongdo and Seodo.

484
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:39,324
-We can't go to Seodo.
-That's right.

485
00:27:39,407 --> 00:27:42,452
SEODO, DONGDO

486
00:27:45,538 --> 00:27:47,916
EXHAUSTED FROM THEIR DOKDO TOUR

487
00:27:50,293 --> 00:27:54,422
THEY RETURN TO KIAN'S B&B
TO GET THEIR BELONGINGS AND CHECK OUT

488
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:56,049
Hey there.

489
00:27:56,132 --> 00:27:58,551
-Hello.
-Hello.

490
00:27:58,635 --> 00:27:59,803
Welcome back.

491
00:28:02,555 --> 00:28:04,182
-Did you have fun?
-Yes.

492
00:28:04,265 --> 00:28:05,809
We went to Dokdo.

493
00:28:05,892 --> 00:28:08,061
It's usually hard to get there
because of the weather.

494
00:28:08,144 --> 00:28:08,978
I know, right?

495
00:28:09,062 --> 00:28:12,065
Yes, they even said
they didn't know if we could dock

496
00:28:12,148 --> 00:28:13,900
right until the end.

497
00:28:13,983 --> 00:28:15,193
How lucky.

498
00:28:18,238 --> 00:28:19,531
We need to check out.

499
00:28:22,492 --> 00:28:23,535
We should get going.

500
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,996
-Are you sad about leaving, Dam?
-Yes.

501
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,832
Do you want to stay longer, Yul?

502
00:28:28,915 --> 00:28:31,167
I want to stay here longer.

503
00:28:31,251 --> 00:28:33,044
Yul didn't get to play badminton.

504
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:34,170
-No.
-You're right.

505
00:28:34,254 --> 00:28:35,839
BADMINTON?

506
00:28:36,464 --> 00:28:37,841
2 DAYS AGO

507
00:28:37,924 --> 00:28:39,843
THEY BROUGHT BADMINTON RACKETS

508
00:28:39,926 --> 00:28:42,053
Do you want to play badminton?

509
00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:44,389
JIN SPOTTED IT

510
00:28:45,181 --> 00:28:47,392
-Are you going to play?
-Yes.

511
00:28:47,475 --> 00:28:49,060
-Okay, bring it here.
-Nice.

512
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:51,062
Do you want to become a badminton pro?

513
00:28:51,146 --> 00:28:52,439
I have a competition this month.

514
00:28:52,522 --> 00:28:54,107
-You're playing in a competition?
-Yes.

515
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:55,692
HE'S A PRO

516
00:28:55,775 --> 00:28:57,610
BADMINTON BATTLE BETWEEN YUL AND JIN

517
00:28:57,694 --> 00:28:59,612
Do your best. The wind is on my side.

518
00:28:59,696 --> 00:29:01,698
YUL SERVES

519
00:29:01,781 --> 00:29:03,616
-Wait, what?
-What the heck?

520
00:29:04,784 --> 00:29:06,619
-Wait, what?
-What the heck?

521
00:29:06,703 --> 00:29:07,996
-The wind…
-Hit it harder.

522
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:09,706
I think the wind will stop him.

523
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:10,999
You need to hit harder.

524
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:13,543
Even a national player can't hit this.

525
00:29:14,794 --> 00:29:16,045
BUMMED

526
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:20,258
ONE MORE TRY

527
00:29:26,222 --> 00:29:27,974
Hey, what are you doing?

528
00:29:28,516 --> 00:29:30,226
You could play by yourself.

529
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:32,437
It's the wind.

530
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,147
Let's switch sides, kiddo.

531
00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:37,150
Look.

532
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:43,364
Wait.

533
00:29:43,907 --> 00:29:44,991
Hold on.

534
00:29:46,576 --> 00:29:49,162
I'm really sorry.
I see what's going on now.

535
00:29:49,245 --> 00:29:50,705
-Here I go.
-I told you it's hard.

536
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:52,874
Watch out!

537
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:54,667
NO NEED TO WATCH OUT

538
00:29:56,503 --> 00:29:58,421
Okay, I'm annoyed now.

539
00:30:03,009 --> 00:30:04,385
I'll hit it back. Go ahead.

540
00:30:05,678 --> 00:30:07,180
Gosh, it went over the fence.

541
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:09,599
Gosh, it went over the fence.

542
00:30:10,266 --> 00:30:11,851
It fell on the boat.

543
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:14,813
I'll pick it up for you.

544
00:30:14,896 --> 00:30:15,939
RESCUES THE SHUTTLECOCK

545
00:30:16,022 --> 00:30:17,649
This wet shuttlecock is for you.

546
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:19,317
Thank you.

547
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,860
It's a gift from the world star.

548
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:25,990
I should hang this on my wall
since it's an honor.

549
00:30:27,242 --> 00:30:31,287
My favorite moment
was playing badminton with Jin.

550
00:30:31,371 --> 00:30:34,499
He knew I liked badminton
and asked me to play with him.

551
00:30:34,582 --> 00:30:36,626
That was the greatest service ever.

552
00:30:36,709 --> 00:30:39,295
I played badminton with Jin from BTS.

553
00:30:40,755 --> 00:30:42,423
Do kids these days know BTS?

554
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:43,925
-We all do.
-Of course.

555
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:46,010
-Dam doesn't.
-Even kids his age know.

556
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:47,554
-Do you know BTS, Dam?
-Yes.

557
00:30:47,637 --> 00:30:48,680
What did they sing?

558
00:30:49,722 --> 00:30:50,849
There's a lot.

559
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:53,017
What about the members? Do you know them?

560
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:54,936
He's so cute.

561
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:56,688
-Jin.
-Right.

562
00:30:57,397 --> 00:30:58,314
Right.

563
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:03,069
That's practically everyone.
You don't need to know the rest.

564
00:31:03,152 --> 00:31:05,321
Who else do you know?

565
00:31:05,405 --> 00:31:07,323
I don't know anyone else.

566
00:31:07,407 --> 00:31:09,784
-He doesn't know anyone else.
-He only knows Jin.

567
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:13,496
I ONLY LIKE UNCLE JIN

568
00:31:14,163 --> 00:31:16,708
-He's all you need to know.
-Do you know any songs?

569
00:31:16,791 --> 00:31:20,545
-There's "Butter" and "Dynamite."
-Hey, you know your stuff.

570
00:31:20,628 --> 00:31:22,171
What about the members?

571
00:31:22,255 --> 00:31:23,464
Jin, RM, Jung Kook…

572
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:25,258
No, all you need to know is Jin.

573
00:31:25,341 --> 00:31:27,135
JUST REMEMBER ME

574
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:30,972
Great job, guys.
You guys are really smart.

575
00:31:31,848 --> 00:31:33,600
-They need to work now.
-It's been fun.

576
00:31:33,683 --> 00:31:35,894
-Thank you.
-I'll carry this for you.

577
00:31:35,977 --> 00:31:37,937
-It's heavy though.
-No, it's fine.

578
00:31:38,021 --> 00:31:39,564
How long are you staying in Ulleungdo?

579
00:31:39,647 --> 00:31:41,858
-We're staying until tomorrow.
-Until tomorrow.

580
00:31:41,941 --> 00:31:42,859
We should go.

581
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:45,361
-I had fun.
-Thank you.

582
00:31:48,072 --> 00:31:50,325
-Make sure they get back safely.
-Okay.

583
00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:52,035
Let's go.

584
00:31:52,118 --> 00:31:53,912
-Take care.
-Yeah.

585
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:56,205
Goodbye.

586
00:31:56,289 --> 00:31:57,415
-Bye.
-Thank you.

587
00:32:01,836 --> 00:32:04,923
I feel sad about leaving.
Time goes by so quickly.

588
00:32:05,006 --> 00:32:09,677
-Could you stay one more night?
-No, we should leave on a high note.

589
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:16,893
Take my hand.

590
00:32:18,978 --> 00:32:21,564
-Bye.
-Bye, Captain.

591
00:32:22,106 --> 00:32:23,149
THE HA FAMILY CHECKS OUT

592
00:32:23,232 --> 00:32:24,233
Say goodbye.

593
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:29,781
You don't know
how many check-ins we have today?

594
00:32:29,864 --> 00:32:31,866
-I don't.
-I'll cook today.

595
00:32:35,828 --> 00:32:38,206
COOKING, CLEANING,
AND DOING THE LAUNDRY ALL DAY

596
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:39,248
Is there anything else?

597
00:32:39,332 --> 00:32:40,875
-That's how it's supposed to be.
-True.

598
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:43,503
I felt bad when I was cooking
as the guests arrived.

599
00:32:43,586 --> 00:32:45,380
-It's better to be prepped.
-In advance.

600
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:48,508
THINKING ABOUT GUESTS
EVEN WHEN THERE ARE NONE

601
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:50,635
Why isn't Ye-eun back yet?

602
00:32:50,718 --> 00:32:52,345
Ye-eun…

603
00:32:53,554 --> 00:32:55,306
She's probably chilling in a cafe.

604
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:56,432
YE-EUN ARRIVES

605
00:32:56,516 --> 00:32:58,893
When did you get here?
I didn't hear you coming.

606
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:01,729
-Let's go and cook.
-We're cooking already?

607
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:03,856
We keep eating and cooking over and over.

608
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:05,024
It's 3:20 p.m.

609
00:33:05,108 --> 00:33:07,860
I need to go and paint.

610
00:33:07,944 --> 00:33:10,238
Let's go. Dinner should be ready
before the guests arrive.

611
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:11,572
TO-DO LIST
PAINT, PREPARE DINNER

612
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:13,866
We'll be busy again
once the guests arrive.

613
00:33:19,372 --> 00:33:20,873
I should paint it like a comic.

614
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:26,337
WHAT IS HE PAINTING?

615
00:33:38,725 --> 00:33:40,309
-Hello?
-Hello?

616
00:33:40,393 --> 00:33:43,771
-Hi, I'm checking in today.
-Oh, hello.

617
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:45,023
How big is your group?

618
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:47,442
-It's just me.
-One person.

619
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:49,652
-We're at Hyeonpo Port.
-Got it.

620
00:33:49,736 --> 00:33:53,865
-That's where you need to go.
-Okay, I'll see you later.

621
00:33:55,575 --> 00:33:57,577
HIS PHONE RINGS AGAIN RIGHT AWAY

622
00:33:58,578 --> 00:33:59,412
Hello?

623
00:33:59,495 --> 00:34:03,541
Hi, my name is Lee Chang-jun,
and I'll be checking in today.

624
00:34:03,624 --> 00:34:04,584
Hello.

625
00:34:04,667 --> 00:34:07,295
-Yes, where should we go?
-Well…

626
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:09,088
It's called Hyeonpo Port.

627
00:34:09,756 --> 00:34:11,758
You can come by 6 p.m.

628
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:13,051
PICKUP IS AT 6 P.M.

629
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:14,761
-By 6 p.m.?
-Yes.

630
00:34:14,844 --> 00:34:18,598
-How big is your group?
-There are four of us.

631
00:34:19,265 --> 00:34:21,893
We'll come pick you up at 6 p.m.

632
00:34:21,976 --> 00:34:24,145
-Okay, got it.
-Great.

633
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:26,355
We have to go pick them up by 6 p.m.

634
00:34:26,439 --> 00:34:27,648
-By 6 p.m.
-Two teams.

635
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:29,108
-Four and then five…
-Five.

636
00:34:29,192 --> 00:34:32,070
-So a total of eight people.
-That's right.

637
00:34:32,153 --> 00:34:33,446
8 PEOPLE

638
00:34:34,197 --> 00:34:37,241
SPEEDS UP

639
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:43,956
HE'S BEEN WORKING SILENTLY FOR AN HOUR

640
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:46,793
Oh, man. My back hurts.

641
00:34:49,045 --> 00:34:49,921
My back hurts.

642
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:02,892
Ha Yul.

643
00:35:02,975 --> 00:35:07,605
THE HA FAMILY

644
00:35:07,688 --> 00:35:09,232
-You're all going back tomorrow?
-Yes.

645
00:35:09,315 --> 00:35:10,149
LAST NIGHT

646
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:14,028
We're going to explore the island
for one more day.

647
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:15,613
I planned it leisurely on purpose.

648
00:35:15,696 --> 00:35:21,285
Tomorrow, could I paint you and your kids
and give it to you as a gift?

649
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:22,245
I see.

650
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:25,414
-We have a lot of time.
-That's great.

651
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:28,876

652
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:34,215
DAD, DAM, YUL

653
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:37,677
We eat, cook, and repeat.

654
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:41,013
TONIGHT'S BARE HANDS DINNER MENU
JJAJANG OVER RICE WITH PORK BELLY

655
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:52,859
HE'S NOW CONFIDENT IN COOKING RICE

656
00:35:58,364 --> 00:36:00,449
EMBARRASSED

657
00:36:07,123 --> 00:36:08,708
HE TURNS OFF THE FIRE

658
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:14,380
AFTEREFFECTS OF STUMBLING

659
00:36:15,131 --> 00:36:17,258
CUTS THE ONIONS

660
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:19,427
My eyes are burning.

661
00:36:22,054 --> 00:36:24,390
BOOHOO

662
00:36:26,225 --> 00:36:29,061
Five fried eggs.

663
00:36:29,979 --> 00:36:31,522
DOUSED IN WATER

664
00:36:36,903 --> 00:36:38,571
That stings.

665
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:42,074
HIS SHIRT IS DRENCHED IN WATER AND OIL

666
00:36:43,117 --> 00:36:45,411
FOCUSED EVEN IF IT'S TRICKY

667
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:57,173
That looks good. It turned out great.

668
00:36:58,090 --> 00:37:00,301
It's such a waste
to eat it with our hands.

669
00:37:01,302 --> 00:37:03,763
This looks too good
to eat with our bare hands.

670
00:37:04,347 --> 00:37:06,265
But this is Kian's B&B after all.

671
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:08,559
DINNER IS COMPLETE

672
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:13,314
One, two, three.

673
00:37:17,276 --> 00:37:19,528
RAN OUT OF ENERGY

674
00:37:20,112 --> 00:37:22,573
WIPES OFF THE MOISTURE

675
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:24,951
Shoot.

676
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:26,994
Three.

677
00:37:33,542 --> 00:37:36,170
TURNS ON THE AIR CONDITIONING
BEFORE THE NEW GUESTS CHECK IN

678
00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:43,844
CONTINUES TO WORK HARD
WITHOUT TAKING A BREAK

679
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:45,388
We need the blankets.

680
00:37:45,471 --> 00:37:46,681
Right, the blankets.

681
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:48,557
TIME TO FOLD THE BLANKETS

682
00:37:48,641 --> 00:37:49,850
Hold on to this.

683
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:53,688
-You're stacking it?
-Yes.

684
00:37:57,441 --> 00:37:58,859
-That's all, right?
-Yes.

685
00:38:00,653 --> 00:38:03,322
Hold this and tie it around my back.

686
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:06,325
It's heavy.

687
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:07,952
-Like this.
-Okay.

688
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:15,960
-Is it falling?
-No.

689
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:20,548
This is such a tough job.

690
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:23,426
THE STAFF STRICTLY FOLLOWS THE RULES

691
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:27,305
Having enlisted in the military
is paying off.

692
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:30,975
FORMER DRILL INSTRUCTOR,
SERGEANT KIM SEOK-JIN

693
00:38:32,018 --> 00:38:35,104
FULFILLING THE DUTY
OF TIDYING UP THE BLANKETS

694
00:38:35,187 --> 00:38:36,897
I made it, Boss.

695
00:38:37,398 --> 00:38:39,066
-How did you do it?
-Take a look.

696
00:38:41,277 --> 00:38:42,695
-You carried it?
-Yes.

697
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:45,948
You're so strong.

698
00:38:48,409 --> 00:38:50,036
-Did you mop the floor?
-Yes.

699
00:38:50,536 --> 00:38:53,122
WITHOUT TAKING A BREAK

700
00:38:53,205 --> 00:38:59,295
HE FOLDS THE BLANKETS NEATLY
FOR THE NEW GUESTS

701
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:12,183
I should finish this soon.

702
00:39:13,642 --> 00:39:15,728
-What time is it?
-Fifty minutes in.

703
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:17,188
Hey.

704
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:19,273
-How's this?
-Show me.

705
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:23,277
Oh, that's amazing.

706
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:24,987
-That looks incredible.
-Right?

707
00:39:25,071 --> 00:39:27,323
-That looks exactly like them.
-Seriously.

708
00:39:40,836 --> 00:39:42,254
LATER THAT NIGHT

709
00:39:54,683 --> 00:39:56,102
Good evening.

710
00:39:59,688 --> 00:40:01,899
-Did you have fun today?
-Yes.

711
00:40:04,318 --> 00:40:05,653
I made a painting for you.

712
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:10,783
Do you know I'm an artist?
What did you think I did for a living?

713
00:40:12,576 --> 00:40:13,911
A YouTuber.

714
00:40:13,994 --> 00:40:15,287
-A YouTuber?
-Yes.

715
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:17,540
You used to draw webtoons.

716
00:40:17,623 --> 00:40:18,749
-You knew that?
-Yes.

717
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:19,917
Really?

718
00:40:20,876 --> 00:40:21,919
This is it.

719
00:40:23,003 --> 00:40:23,879
Here's Mr. Ha.

720
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:26,340
Dam and Yul.

721
00:40:29,218 --> 00:40:32,430
There's a scene like this
in typical animation intros.

722
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:34,557
That's what I tried to capture.

723
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:39,770
And I added the clovers
since four-leaf clovers mean luck.

724
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:43,899
I was hoping that
lots of lucky things happen to you guys.

725
00:40:48,988 --> 00:40:49,989
Thank you so much.

726
00:40:52,074 --> 00:40:55,202
You guys need to grow up
and become your dad's drinking buddies.

727
00:40:56,662 --> 00:40:57,997
You'll grow up fast.

728
00:40:59,707 --> 00:41:01,959
I'm sure they'll grow up into brave men.

729
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:04,503
You're right.

730
00:41:08,174 --> 00:41:09,758
Here you go.

731
00:41:09,842 --> 00:41:12,887
-Hang it in your house, okay?
-Okay, we will.

732
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:16,974
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

733
00:41:18,058 --> 00:41:20,227
-Listen to your dad.
-Okay.

734
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:27,651
Good luck, Kian84!

735
00:41:30,404 --> 00:41:31,739
Good luck, Yul!

736
00:41:32,907 --> 00:41:34,200
Good luck, Dam!

737
00:41:35,576 --> 00:41:36,660
You too, Mr. Ha.

738
00:41:41,457 --> 00:41:44,502
Gosh, I got a bit teary-eyed.

739
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:46,462
That was close.

740
00:41:50,424 --> 00:41:55,012
I don't think
age necessarily defines your youth.

741
00:41:55,095 --> 00:41:58,724
I think it vanishes
when one is tired and drained.

742
00:41:58,807 --> 00:42:00,059
If that doesn't happen,

743
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:03,312
I'll have my youth with me until I die.

744
00:42:05,231 --> 00:42:08,234
DAD, DAM, YUL

745
00:42:10,861 --> 00:42:14,615
4 HOURS AGO AT KIAN'S B&B

746
00:42:15,115 --> 00:42:17,117
I'll go and pick up the guests now.

747
00:42:17,618 --> 00:42:18,702
Have a safe trip.

748
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:23,958
THE OWNER BRUSHES HIS TEETH
TO GREET THE GUESTS

749
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:25,459
JIN CHECKS THE TOWELS

750
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:27,586
I want to dry them for a bit longer.

751
00:42:28,712 --> 00:42:31,423
I know you're going to say
they're good to use.

752
00:42:31,507 --> 00:42:32,508
They're perfect.

753
00:42:33,008 --> 00:42:34,802
-They're fine.
-They're a bit damp.

754
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:36,512
See? This part is wet.

755
00:42:37,012 --> 00:42:40,057
THOROUGHLY CHECKS THEM

756
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:42,685
THOROUGHLY BRUSHES HIS TEETH

757
00:42:44,353 --> 00:42:45,729
Where is everyone?

758
00:42:45,813 --> 00:42:47,273
HYEONPO PORT IS EMPTY

759
00:42:47,356 --> 00:42:48,357
What's going on?

760
00:42:49,108 --> 00:42:52,236
A CAR ARRIVES JUST THEN

761
00:43:08,669 --> 00:43:12,548
Any guests for Kian's B&B
to be picked up at 6 p.m.?

762
00:43:13,132 --> 00:43:14,216
There he is.

763
00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:16,051
Do I take the boat?

764
00:43:17,428 --> 00:43:18,429
Hello.

765
00:43:18,512 --> 00:43:19,471
Oh, hello.

766
00:43:19,555 --> 00:43:21,974
-Is it just you?
-Yes, it's just me.

767
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:24,101
Where is Hyeonpo Port?

768
00:43:24,184 --> 00:43:26,228
THE GROUP GUEST AT THE SAME HOUR?

769
00:43:26,312 --> 00:43:29,106
I wonder what the B&B
is going to look like.

770
00:43:29,189 --> 00:43:30,608
It's a secret.

771
00:43:30,691 --> 00:43:32,151
Wait, isn't that Ji Ye-eun?

772
00:43:32,234 --> 00:43:33,485
Shut up!

773
00:43:35,195 --> 00:43:37,197
-You don't know?
-That was spot on.

774
00:43:37,906 --> 00:43:38,907
Chill out!

775
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:41,785
Lee Chang-jun, chill out!

776
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:42,953
You guys are good.

777
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:48,459
Guests for Kian's B&B for 6 p.m. pickup?

778
00:43:50,544 --> 00:43:53,672
-Hello.
-Hello.

779
00:43:53,756 --> 00:43:56,008
THE NEW GUESTS MEET EACH OTHER
FOR THE FIRST TIME

780
00:43:56,091 --> 00:43:58,302
THEY ALSO MEET CAPTAIN JI
FOR THE FIRST TIME

781
00:43:59,178 --> 00:44:01,221
EXCITED REACTIONS

782
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:02,973
-What's that?
-Do we take a boat?

783
00:44:03,057 --> 00:44:04,975
-Please get on.
-Nice to meet you.

784
00:44:05,059 --> 00:44:07,311
-Hello.
-Thank you.

785
00:44:07,394 --> 00:44:09,647
-Did you put on your life vests?
-Yes.

786
00:44:10,689 --> 00:44:12,358
-We're off then.
-Okay.

787
00:44:12,441 --> 00:44:13,942
We'll leave it up to you.

788
00:44:14,026 --> 00:44:14,943
SKILLFUL STEERING

789
00:44:16,362 --> 00:44:18,405
IMPRESSED

790
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:20,991
-Did you learn to drive for this show?
-Yes.

791
00:44:21,075 --> 00:44:23,118
WOW

792
00:44:23,202 --> 00:44:25,954
-Are you guys all friends?
-Yes.

793
00:44:26,038 --> 00:44:27,665
That must be fun.

794
00:44:27,748 --> 00:44:29,166
-Are you by yourself?
-Yes.

795
00:44:29,875 --> 00:44:31,710
-That's so cool.
-Not really.

796
00:44:39,301 --> 00:44:41,011
SHOWERING WITH PRAISE

797
00:44:41,095 --> 00:44:43,639
-That was an amazing turn.
-That's so cool.

798
00:44:43,722 --> 00:44:45,015
Ji Ye-eun!

799
00:44:45,099 --> 00:44:47,768
-Ji Ye-eun!
-Ji Ye-eun!

800
00:44:47,851 --> 00:44:49,853
-Ji Ye-eun!
-Ji Ye-eun!

801
00:44:50,729 --> 00:44:52,731
I love this.

802
00:44:53,607 --> 00:44:55,150
I love your enthusiasm.

803
00:44:58,362 --> 00:44:59,822
Is that where we're going?

804
00:44:59,905 --> 00:45:01,532
That can't be the B&B.

805
00:45:01,615 --> 00:45:03,158
No way.

806
00:45:03,242 --> 00:45:04,243
That is indeed the B&B.

807
00:45:04,326 --> 00:45:05,160
YES WAY

808
00:45:07,329 --> 00:45:08,163
What is this place?

809
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:10,999
AT A LOSS FOR WORDS

810
00:45:11,583 --> 00:45:13,001
-What the heck?
-Is that it?

811
00:45:13,085 --> 00:45:14,211
SHOCKED

812
00:45:14,294 --> 00:45:16,046
There's a climbing wall too.

813
00:45:19,425 --> 00:45:20,968
I LOVE IT

814
00:45:21,051 --> 00:45:22,553
DOPAMINE RUSH

815
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:25,055
KIAN'S B&B

816
00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:26,890
READY FOR CHECK-IN

817
00:45:26,974 --> 00:45:30,519
-I can't hear you!
-Aye, aye, Captain!

818
00:45:31,770 --> 00:45:34,064
-What is that?
-No one gets seasickness, right?

819
00:45:34,148 --> 00:45:36,733
-We're sleeping on the water?
-That's why there was no address.

820
00:45:36,817 --> 00:45:38,110
THE OWNER'S BIG PICTURE

821
00:45:38,193 --> 00:45:39,027
You're right.

822
00:45:39,111 --> 00:45:39,945
You can get off.

823
00:45:40,028 --> 00:45:41,447
-Okay.
-Thank you.

824
00:45:42,156 --> 00:45:44,575
-Give me your luggage first.
-Thank you.

825
00:45:46,243 --> 00:45:48,370
We have some fit people again.

826
00:45:48,454 --> 00:45:50,289
They're soldiers, without a doubt.

827
00:45:50,372 --> 00:45:52,458
-Good evening.
-Hello.

828
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,085
-Hello.
-Please come up.

829
00:45:55,169 --> 00:45:56,253
Hello.

830
00:45:56,336 --> 00:45:58,338
We should keep our life vests on.

831
00:46:02,217 --> 00:46:04,845
-You can put the luggage here.
-Damn!

832
00:46:04,928 --> 00:46:06,305
-Hello.
-Hello.

833
00:46:06,388 --> 00:46:08,098
-Hello.
-Good evening.

834
00:46:08,182 --> 00:46:09,892
THE OWNER APPEARS

835
00:46:09,975 --> 00:46:12,227
But there was a female guest
who called me.

836
00:46:12,311 --> 00:46:14,646
He's here by himself.

837
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:16,982
Why was it a woman's voice?

838
00:46:17,065 --> 00:46:19,735
-No, he's here by himself.
-I see.

839
00:46:19,818 --> 00:46:21,069
Yes, that was me.

840
00:46:21,153 --> 00:46:23,280
-So there's one guest and a group of four?
-Yes.

841
00:46:23,363 --> 00:46:24,364
-I see.
-Okay.

842
00:46:24,448 --> 00:46:26,283
What does everyone do?

843
00:46:26,366 --> 00:46:27,493
I graduated yesterday.

844
00:46:27,576 --> 00:46:29,953
LEE CHANG-JUN, COLLEGE GRADUATE
CHO EUN-SIK, COLLEGE STUDENT

845
00:46:30,037 --> 00:46:32,956
PARK JOHN, COLLEGE GRADUATE
KIM MYEONG-GYUN, COLLEGE GRADUATE

846
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:34,500
These two lift as a hobby.

847
00:46:34,583 --> 00:46:36,418
WEIGHTLIFTING CLUB

848
00:46:36,502 --> 00:46:38,378
He seems the most…

849
00:46:38,462 --> 00:46:40,380
You look like
you were on the special forces.

850
00:46:40,464 --> 00:46:41,590
WHO IS THIS SPECIAL GUEST?

851
00:46:41,673 --> 00:46:43,592
-You seem like an athlete.
-I was.

852
00:46:43,675 --> 00:46:45,636
-Maybe martial arts.
-I see that.

853
00:46:45,719 --> 00:46:47,179
-Am I right?
-Yes.

854
00:46:47,262 --> 00:46:49,556
PARK CHUNG-IL, FORMER MMA FIGHTER

855
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:52,559
Right now, I work at a hotel.

856
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:56,730
The first floor doesn't have a door.

857
00:46:56,813 --> 00:46:58,148
INTRODUCING THE HOUSE

858
00:46:58,232 --> 00:46:59,191
I prefer that.

859
00:46:59,858 --> 00:47:01,527
-What a strange B&B.
-Right?

860
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:04,738
You have to climb here
to get to the second floor.

861
00:47:05,989 --> 00:47:09,743
And you can come down on the slide.

862
00:47:09,826 --> 00:47:11,328
Shouldn't we go in the water?

863
00:47:11,411 --> 00:47:14,706
-I feel like I'm in a dream!
-I love this.

864
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:16,667
They're so excited.

865
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:18,877
THEIR REACTIONS
GET THE EMPLOYEES PUMPED UP

866
00:47:18,961 --> 00:47:21,547
-I love this.
-Those are the beds over there.

867
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:26,635
I can't believe this!

868
00:47:26,718 --> 00:47:30,138
I LOVE IT

869
00:47:31,765 --> 00:47:34,685
IF YOU GUYS ARE HAPPY, I'M HAPPY

870
00:47:34,768 --> 00:47:36,311
I'm glad you guys love it.

871
00:47:36,853 --> 00:47:40,482
-The pink slide goes to the first floor.
-Okay.

872
00:47:40,566 --> 00:47:44,653
If you take the yellow one by mistake,
you'll fall into the pool.

873
00:47:44,736 --> 00:47:46,029
They freaking love it.

874
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:50,367
-I love this!
-I love this!

875
00:47:50,450 --> 00:47:52,160
SUPER EXCITED

876
00:47:52,244 --> 00:47:54,079
Over there is the gym.

877
00:47:54,162 --> 00:47:55,247
SHY BUT PLEASED

878
00:47:55,330 --> 00:47:56,873
And…

879
00:47:56,957 --> 00:47:58,375
THE WEIGHTLIFTING CLUB IS ECSTATIC

880
00:47:58,458 --> 00:48:01,920
And next to that
is the bathroom and showers.

881
00:48:02,004 --> 00:48:02,838
Okay.

882
00:48:02,921 --> 00:48:05,716
I'll explain the second-floor rooms
once we're up there.

883
00:48:05,799 --> 00:48:06,842
-Okay!
-Got it.

884
00:48:06,925 --> 00:48:09,052
You can carry your own belongings.

885
00:48:09,136 --> 00:48:10,596
-Got it!
-Okay.

886
00:48:11,555 --> 00:48:14,516
CHANG-JUN CLIMBS UP FIRST

887
00:48:15,809 --> 00:48:17,060
That looks fun.

888
00:48:17,144 --> 00:48:18,437
-He's good at this.
-Yeah.

889
00:48:21,607 --> 00:48:23,734
How is the inside?

890
00:48:23,817 --> 00:48:24,860
Tell us. How is it?

891
00:48:24,943 --> 00:48:26,695
-This feels like a dream.
-Really?

892
00:48:26,778 --> 00:48:28,196
It's my first time climbing.

893
00:48:32,284 --> 00:48:33,285
What the heck?

894
00:48:36,913 --> 00:48:38,790
-Incredible.
-I can't believe it.

895
00:48:38,874 --> 00:48:40,250
Tell me about it.

896
00:48:40,834 --> 00:48:43,920
What is this? How is this possible?

897
00:48:44,463 --> 00:48:45,589
This is crazy.

898
00:48:47,382 --> 00:48:49,509
CHUNG-IL IS THE LAST ONE

899
00:48:50,510 --> 00:48:53,305
POWERFUL MOVEMENTS

900
00:48:58,393 --> 00:49:02,898
Now that you're here at Kian's B&B,
you're going to ride the waterslide.

901
00:49:02,981 --> 00:49:06,068
-Does everyone have swimsuits?
-Yes, sir.

902
00:49:06,151 --> 00:49:09,154
-Please change into them.
-Yes, sir.

903
00:49:09,237 --> 00:49:12,115
Is this the military or something?

904
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:13,784
SERGEANT JIN AT ULLEUNGDO ISLAND

905
00:49:14,618 --> 00:49:17,037
THE OBEDIENT TRAINEES

906
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:18,538
-Hey, move.
-Wait.

907
00:49:19,414 --> 00:49:22,876
TRAINEE LEE CHANG-JUN DESCENDS
TRAINEE KIM MYEONG-GYUN DESCENDS

908
00:49:22,959 --> 00:49:26,338
TRAINEE CHO EUN-SIK DESCENDS
TRAINEE PARK JOHN DESCENDS

909
00:49:26,838 --> 00:49:29,007
WHERE'S CHUNG-IL?

910
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:32,302
LOOKS AROUND

911
00:49:35,514 --> 00:49:38,433
-I'm too overwhelmed.
-Take your time.

912
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:42,270
CHUNG-IL, THE INTROVERT,
SLIDES DOWN AS WELL

913
00:49:49,194 --> 00:49:50,153
What's this?

914
00:49:51,655 --> 00:49:52,698
What's this place?

915
00:49:53,198 --> 00:49:54,825
-This is amazing.
-This is cool!

916
00:49:57,077 --> 00:49:58,829
I think this is the changing room.

917
00:49:58,912 --> 00:50:01,915
-Who wants to share?
-Let's all go in.

918
00:50:01,998 --> 00:50:05,043
-Come inside.
-Wait.

919
00:50:06,837 --> 00:50:07,963
Someone's touching me.

920
00:50:08,755 --> 00:50:09,589
Wait.

921
00:50:10,173 --> 00:50:13,051
-It's like a storm passed by.
-I like their energy.

922
00:50:13,135 --> 00:50:16,179
They were shouting my name
and calling me captain.

923
00:50:18,432 --> 00:50:20,308
-The mood's completely changed.
-Yeah.

924
00:50:20,392 --> 00:50:22,269
The first and second groups
are very different.

925
00:50:22,352 --> 00:50:24,938
I know.
They have a crazy amount of energy.

926
00:50:26,106 --> 00:50:27,065
10 MINUTES LATER

927
00:50:27,149 --> 00:50:29,443
-Please stand in one line.
-Yes, sir.

928
00:50:29,526 --> 00:50:32,654
-Please stretch before using the slide.
-Yes, sir.

929
00:50:32,738 --> 00:50:33,864
Start with the ankles.

930
00:50:33,947 --> 00:50:35,907
1. STRETCH YOUR WRISTS AND ANKLES

931
00:50:35,991 --> 00:50:37,743
…five, six, seven, eight.

932
00:50:37,826 --> 00:50:41,788
Two, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

933
00:50:41,872 --> 00:50:42,831
From the left.

934
00:50:42,914 --> 00:50:46,710
2. STRETCH YOUR SHOULDERS

935
00:50:46,793 --> 00:50:50,839
Two, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

936
00:50:50,922 --> 00:50:51,798
Rotate your knees.

937
00:50:51,882 --> 00:50:55,594
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

938
00:50:55,677 --> 00:50:57,763
YE-EUN IS EMBARRASSED FOR HIM

939
00:50:57,846 --> 00:50:59,514
-Oh no.
-Five, six, seven, eight.

940
00:51:00,265 --> 00:51:01,933
-Great job, guys!
-Thank you!

941
00:51:02,017 --> 00:51:03,351
Who wants to go first?

942
00:51:03,435 --> 00:51:04,978
-Me!
-Okay, you go first.

943
00:51:05,061 --> 00:51:06,813
LEE CHANG-JUN GOES FIRST

944
00:51:06,897 --> 00:51:08,482
Please stand over there.

945
00:51:08,565 --> 00:51:09,858
-Sit down.
-Okay.

946
00:51:12,027 --> 00:51:15,864
-Put your arms on your chest.
-Got it, sir.

947
00:51:15,947 --> 00:51:18,158
EVERYONE IS INTERESTED IN THE FIRST DIVE

948
00:51:18,241 --> 00:51:19,326
This is hilarious.

949
00:51:19,868 --> 00:51:20,744
Go, Chang-jun!

950
00:51:20,827 --> 00:51:23,497
THE OWNER GOES OUT TO THE FRONT SEAT

951
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:24,748
Go, Chang-jun!

952
00:51:24,831 --> 00:51:26,917
Trainee Lee Chang-jun dives in!

953
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:30,629
-Gosh.
-You got this, Chang-jun!

954
00:51:33,173 --> 00:51:34,299
Wow, this is fun.

955
00:51:34,382 --> 00:51:35,509
BEST SEAT IN THE HOUSE

956
00:51:37,761 --> 00:51:39,387
BEST FEELING IN THE WORLD

957
00:51:39,471 --> 00:51:42,140
-What's your name?
-I'm Park John.

958
00:51:42,224 --> 00:51:44,226
-Get ready to dive, John.
-Yes, sir.

959
00:51:45,185 --> 00:51:46,061
Go, John.

960
00:51:46,144 --> 00:51:48,605
Military Exempt Park John blasts off!

961
00:51:53,735 --> 00:51:54,653
SUPER DISCIPLINED

962
00:51:54,736 --> 00:51:56,238
-Your name?
-I'm Kim Myeong-gyun.

963
00:51:56,321 --> 00:51:57,989
-Get ready to dive.
-Yes, sir.

964
00:51:58,073 --> 00:51:59,699
-You're not 30 yet, right?
-No.

965
00:51:59,783 --> 00:52:01,868
Get ready to dive, Myeong-gyun!

966
00:52:01,952 --> 00:52:02,911
Ready!

967
00:52:05,372 --> 00:52:07,249
-Go, Myeong-gyun!
-Yes, sir!

968
00:52:07,332 --> 00:52:08,917
Mom, I love you!

969
00:52:15,882 --> 00:52:16,925
UNEASY

970
00:52:17,008 --> 00:52:18,510
-Go, Eun-sik!
-Yes, sir!

971
00:52:18,593 --> 00:52:20,637
-Say, "I love you, Mom."
-I love you, Mom.

972
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:22,264
DRY LIPS

973
00:52:22,931 --> 00:52:26,142
CHUNG-IL, THE INTROVERT, IS VERY NERVOUS

974
00:52:26,226 --> 00:52:27,477
-My name is Chung-il.
-Chung-il?

975
00:52:27,561 --> 00:52:29,771
-How old are you?
-I'm 33.

976
00:52:29,855 --> 00:52:31,565
Hey, we're the same age.

977
00:52:31,648 --> 00:52:33,108
EASES HIS TENSION BY CHATTING

978
00:52:33,191 --> 00:52:34,693
Get ready to dive, Chung-il.

979
00:52:34,776 --> 00:52:36,862
NERVOUS AGAIN

980
00:52:36,945 --> 00:52:38,363
Say it loud.

981
00:52:38,446 --> 00:52:39,364
Ready, Chung-il?

982
00:52:39,447 --> 00:52:40,949
SHY

983
00:52:41,032 --> 00:52:42,617
-What should I say?
-"Ready to dive in."

984
00:52:42,701 --> 00:52:43,827
Ready to dive in!

985
00:52:44,452 --> 00:52:46,037
WE'RE CHEERING FOR YOU

986
00:52:46,121 --> 00:52:47,163
You can do it!

987
00:52:47,664 --> 00:52:48,748
You got this!

988
00:52:48,832 --> 00:52:50,166
Dive blast off!

989
00:52:50,792 --> 00:52:52,669
MESSED UP BECAUSE HE WAS NERVOUS

990
00:52:58,133 --> 00:52:59,259
You should go in too.

991
00:53:02,470 --> 00:53:03,972
I'm going in now.

992
00:53:05,432 --> 00:53:07,475
EXCITED

993
00:53:08,059 --> 00:53:09,978
I want my life vest.

994
00:53:13,607 --> 00:53:16,735
HE'S A SCAREDY-CAT DESPITE HIS ACTIONS

995
00:53:17,485 --> 00:53:19,404
Jin is ready to dive!

996
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:23,992
I love you, ARMY!

997
00:53:27,495 --> 00:53:30,123
I LOVE YOU, ARMY!

998
00:53:35,462 --> 00:53:37,172
I love you, ARMY!

999
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:40,926
Wow, that's amazing.

1000
00:53:44,554 --> 00:53:48,350
-He's still good-looking in that state.
-Seriously.

1001
00:53:50,810 --> 00:53:53,897
-He's still good-looking in that state.
-Seriously.

1002
00:53:54,648 --> 00:53:55,774
I'm jealous.

1003
00:53:58,276 --> 00:53:59,611
It was my first time too.

1004
00:53:59,694 --> 00:54:00,528
-Really?
-What?

1005
00:54:01,112 --> 00:54:03,365
-It's your first time riding this?
-Yes.

1006
00:54:04,616 --> 00:54:06,368
Whose name should I call out?

1007
00:54:06,451 --> 00:54:07,410
FEELS PRESSURED

1008
00:54:07,494 --> 00:54:08,745
You nervous?

1009
00:54:08,828 --> 00:54:09,829
NODS

1010
00:54:09,913 --> 00:54:12,624
Kian84 is ready to dive!

1011
00:54:14,417 --> 00:54:17,337
THINKING HARD

1012
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:19,839
Whose name should I call out?

1013
00:54:19,923 --> 00:54:20,882
Your mom.

1014
00:54:21,549 --> 00:54:22,550
My mom?

1015
00:54:23,969 --> 00:54:24,844
Lee Chang-jun!

1016
00:54:26,554 --> 00:54:27,597
Hurry up!

1017
00:54:27,681 --> 00:54:29,224
I love my guests!

1018
00:54:33,436 --> 00:54:36,272
THE GUESTS ARE HAPPY

1019
00:54:40,193 --> 00:54:41,820
-Let's wash up.
-Okay.

1020
00:54:43,905 --> 00:54:45,198
Wow, that was fun.

1021
00:54:50,495 --> 00:54:51,955
-Get down.
-Yes, sir!

1022
00:55:05,051 --> 00:55:06,136
Next.

1023
00:55:07,637 --> 00:55:08,930
-Again?
-It's my turn.

1024
00:55:28,116 --> 00:55:29,284
Come downstairs, everyone.

1025
00:55:30,452 --> 00:55:33,830
BARE-HANDS DINNER IS READY TO BE SERVED

1026
00:55:34,414 --> 00:55:37,917
THE GUESTS HAVE NO IDEA
THEY'RE EATING WITH THEIR OWN HANDS

1027
00:55:39,586 --> 00:55:40,670
This is awesome.

1028
00:55:43,590 --> 00:55:44,966
This looks amazing.

1029
00:55:45,050 --> 00:55:47,135
FILLING THEIR BOWLS

1030
00:55:48,803 --> 00:55:49,804
Try it.

1031
00:55:49,888 --> 00:55:51,806
ONCE THE SIDE DISHES ARE ADDED

1032
00:55:53,641 --> 00:55:56,728
DINNER IS READY

1033
00:55:56,811 --> 00:55:59,189
TAP TAP

1034
00:55:59,272 --> 00:56:01,316
-Is there any rice left?
-You want more?

1035
00:56:02,776 --> 00:56:05,820
-Why did you…
-I don't think this will be enough.

1036
00:56:05,904 --> 00:56:08,281
-That's nice of you.
-Good.

1037
00:56:08,865 --> 00:56:11,534
FILLED TO THE BRIM

1038
00:56:12,118 --> 00:56:13,620
ADDS JJAJANG SAUCE

1039
00:56:22,837 --> 00:56:24,714
AN ENTIRE BOWL OF JJAJANG

1040
00:56:25,632 --> 00:56:27,550
Gosh, that's a lot.

1041
00:56:27,634 --> 00:56:30,970
-Ye-eun, why are you eating so little?
-I can't eat a lot right now.

1042
00:56:31,679 --> 00:56:34,349
I'm holding myself back.
How can I eat here?

1043
00:56:34,432 --> 00:56:38,228
-Are you saying my cooking is bad?
-No, there's a good reason.

1044
00:56:38,311 --> 00:56:40,188
-What is it?
-You'll find out soon.

1045
00:56:40,271 --> 00:56:43,608
OMINOUS

1046
00:56:43,691 --> 00:56:45,318
That sounds ominous.

1047
00:56:45,401 --> 00:56:47,529
I mixed a lot of things into the rice.

1048
00:56:48,071 --> 00:56:49,280
Yes, he did.

1049
00:56:49,364 --> 00:56:50,406
SUSPICIOUS

1050
00:56:50,490 --> 00:56:51,825
He even added pork belly.

1051
00:56:51,908 --> 00:56:53,368
-Really?
-Yes, I saw it.

1052
00:56:53,451 --> 00:56:54,285
UNEASY

1053
00:56:54,994 --> 00:57:00,125
We wanted to make this experience
special for our guests.

1054
00:57:00,708 --> 00:57:04,170
So we thought
maybe we should eat with our hands.

1055
00:57:04,754 --> 00:57:07,298
It will feel
as if you're interacting with the food.

1056
00:57:07,382 --> 00:57:08,341
BAFFLED

1057
00:57:08,424 --> 00:57:10,635
-Everything is so new here.
-With our hands?

1058
00:57:11,594 --> 00:57:14,097
-That's why we cleaned our hands.
-I see.

1059
00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:19,060
It feels a bit weird at first
like it's something forbidden.

1060
00:57:19,144 --> 00:57:20,436
"Something forbidden…"

1061
00:57:21,312 --> 00:57:24,065
-Let's mix them altogether.
-Should we mix them together?

1062
00:57:26,568 --> 00:57:28,570
HESITATES

1063
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:31,823
THEIR HANDS WON'T BUDGE

1064
00:57:36,870 --> 00:57:40,206
THE UNMATCHED PRO

1065
00:57:42,125 --> 00:57:44,335

00:57:46,296 --> 00:57:47,630
SO THAT'S HOW YOU DO IT

1067
00:57:48,339 --> 00:57:49,632
LEARNED A LESSON

1068
00:57:50,884 --> 00:57:51,718
ADAPTS QUICKLY

1069
00:57:51,801 --> 00:57:54,053
-He got used to it really fast.
-Look at him go.

1070
00:57:54,137 --> 00:57:56,806
-I still hesitate even after three days.
-That's amazing.

1071
00:57:56,890 --> 00:57:58,683
SURPRISED

1072
00:57:58,766 --> 00:58:00,018
He's different.

1073
00:58:00,101 --> 00:58:01,853
INHERITS KIAN'S SPIRIT

1074
00:58:02,479 --> 00:58:05,648
-Give the owner some.
-No, that's okay.

1075
00:58:05,732 --> 00:58:08,526
-Give the owner some.
-I don't want someone else's.

1076
00:58:08,610 --> 00:58:11,905
-We should give some to Jin.
-No, I'm totally content with mine.

1077
00:58:12,489 --> 00:58:14,032
-Enjoy your meal.
-Thank you.

1078
00:58:14,115 --> 00:58:15,700
Thank you for the meal.

1079
00:58:18,620 --> 00:58:19,621
It's good.

1080
00:58:19,704 --> 00:58:21,831
The boss can make balls out of the rice.

1081
00:58:22,499 --> 00:58:25,418
THE BOSS'S SKILLS

1082
00:58:26,002 --> 00:58:28,087
IN AWE

1083
00:58:36,137 --> 00:58:37,847
-This is really delicious.
-It is.

1084
00:58:37,931 --> 00:58:39,432
-Yes.
-It's really good.

1085
00:58:41,142 --> 00:58:44,312
When I first put it in my mouth
with my hands,

1086
00:58:44,395 --> 00:58:48,066
I wondered if it was salty
because I swam in the ocean.

1087
00:58:48,149 --> 00:58:49,901
Honestly, everything was delicious.

1088
00:58:49,984 --> 00:58:53,696
It really felt like
I was at Kian's B&B during dinner.

1089
00:58:54,864 --> 00:58:57,283
-What's your name?
-It's Kim Myeong-gyun.

1090
00:58:57,367 --> 00:58:59,702
-Myeong-gyun?
-Yes.

1091
00:58:59,786 --> 00:59:02,747
I graduated this year,
and I'm looking for a job.

1092
00:59:02,830 --> 00:59:05,124
What about you, John?

1093
00:59:05,208 --> 00:59:07,418
I'm looking for a job too.

1094
00:59:07,502 --> 00:59:08,920
That's tough.

1095
00:59:09,629 --> 00:59:10,630
Unemployed.

1096
00:59:11,256 --> 00:59:12,257
And your name is?

1097
00:59:12,340 --> 00:59:14,050
-I'm Cho Eun-sik.
-Cho Eun-sik.

1098
00:59:14,133 --> 00:59:15,718
-I'm a college student.
-I see.

1099
00:59:15,802 --> 00:59:18,263
-You're 33 years old, Chung-il?
-Yes, I am.

1100
00:59:18,346 --> 00:59:20,682
-You two are the same age.
-We're friends.

1101
00:59:21,474 --> 00:59:24,269
-When's your birthday?
-It's May 3rd, 1992.

1102
00:59:24,352 --> 00:59:26,145
He's seven months older.

1103
00:59:27,188 --> 00:59:28,356
I'm glad I'm older.

1104
00:59:29,899 --> 00:59:34,195
It's been a while
since people talked about birthdays.

1105
00:59:35,530 --> 00:59:39,742
Is it okay if we use the gym
whenever we want?

1106
00:59:39,826 --> 00:59:40,702
Of course.

1107
00:59:40,785 --> 00:59:42,495
-It's open 24 hours.
-Of course.

1108
00:59:42,579 --> 00:59:45,123
-You guys work out, right?
-Should we go now?

1109
00:59:45,206 --> 00:59:46,791
-Let's go work out.
-Sounds fun.

1110
00:59:48,751 --> 00:59:49,586
Okay!

1111
00:59:49,669 --> 00:59:51,421
-Chung-il!
-Bring it on.

1112
00:59:52,797 --> 00:59:54,674
I didn't want to hit him.

1113
00:59:54,757 --> 00:59:56,593
-Two, three.
-That's sick!

1114
00:59:56,676 --> 00:59:59,262
Since we're fighting,
I'm going all the way.

1115
00:59:59,929 --> 01:00:01,431
Tap out before three seconds.

1116
01:00:02,682 --> 01:00:05,351
KIAN'S BIZARRE B&B
