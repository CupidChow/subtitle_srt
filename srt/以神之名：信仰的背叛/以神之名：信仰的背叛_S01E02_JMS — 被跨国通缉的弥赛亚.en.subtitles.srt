SEOUL, 1999

6
00:00:34,617 --> 00:00:37,454
Followers of a religious organization
were arrested

7
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:39,873
for kidnapping and beating
a former member.

8
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:43,626
Based on a report
that the founder of the organization

9
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:47,338
had repeatedly assaulted
the female followers and took their money,

10
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:48,923
the police started investigating.

11
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:51,843
They are accused
of kidnapping Ms. Hwang, 27,

12
00:00:51,926 --> 00:00:53,553
who left them five months ago,

13
00:00:53,636 --> 00:00:56,681
imprisoning her
and beating her for four hours.

14
00:01:09,944 --> 00:01:14,574
By then, I already realized
that JMS was a cult.

15
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:18,411
So I told them
I didn't want anything to do with him.

16
00:01:19,871 --> 00:01:21,664
They asked me why I hated the president

17
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:24,375
and said I was possessed by the big Devil.

18
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:26,544
They punched me and kicked me

19
00:01:26,628 --> 00:01:29,547
and stomped on my hands,
then kicked me again.

20
00:01:30,673 --> 00:01:32,133
They beat me all over.

21
00:01:33,218 --> 00:01:38,098
Ms. Hwang resided with Jeong Myeong-seok
at the JMS Headquarters,

22
00:01:38,181 --> 00:01:41,976
but left the organization
after she became skeptical about JMS.

23
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:46,773
After leaving, she was trying
to return to her normal life.

24
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:50,443
However, people from JMS
kept attempting to convince her to return.

25
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:53,613
FROM THE MEMOIR OF MS. HWANG, VICTIM
OF SEXUAL ASSAULT AND KIDNAPPING IN 1999

26
00:01:53,696 --> 00:01:54,864
After I left,

27
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:58,451
they called my home and cell phone
to tell me to come back to the church.

28
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:04,582
But I told them that I wouldn't go back
to the church.

29
00:02:07,585 --> 00:02:11,506
They said, "Why don't you come to church?
You're possessed by the Devil,"

30
00:02:11,589 --> 00:02:14,217
while ruthlessly beating me up.

31
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:17,720
Then they forced me into their van.

32
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:25,645
That's how I was taken to the president's
childhood home called Wolmyeongdong.

33
00:02:28,106 --> 00:02:31,067
When I got to the building
where the president lived,

34
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:36,197
I could see two or three rows of shoes
laid out there.

35
00:02:37,782 --> 00:02:39,701
It seemed like it was that day.

36
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:46,332
The day when the president had an orgy
with his female followers.

37
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:53,131
As they were driving me back down,

38
00:02:54,799 --> 00:02:59,304
I was desperate to escape,
so I turned around, grimacing.

39
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:02,974
I was looking at the police,
sending them signals to save me.

40
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:09,522
Through this incident, Jeong Myeong-seok's
sexual assaults, kidnappings, and assaults

41
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:14,527
were exposed to the world
through the media for the first time.

42
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:18,031
Ms. Hwang claims many female followers,
including herself,

43
00:03:18,114 --> 00:03:21,576
were repeatedly sexually assaulted
by Mr. Jeong, the president.

44
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:25,705
He said that he'd borrowed God's body

45
00:03:25,788 --> 00:03:28,333
and that God's spirit resided within him.

46
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:33,087
Being brainwashed for a long time
with something like that

47
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:35,548
is how it became so natural.

48
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:53,441
IN THE NAME OF GOD: A HOLY BETRAYAL

49
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:07,914
JMS, MESSIAH ON RED NOTICE

50
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:22,303
The year 1999
is when Jeong Myeong-seok was crucified.

51
00:04:24,138 --> 00:04:27,016
In 1981, Jeong Myeong-seok said that

52
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:31,479
in 1999, he would be on the news,
he'd be reported and sued,

53
00:04:32,313 --> 00:04:34,232
and that all his followers would leave.

54
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:38,111
Those things actually happened in 1999.

55
00:04:38,861 --> 00:04:41,030
NEWSDESK, JANUARY 7TH, 1999

56
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:42,991
Jeong Myeong-seok, the president of JMS,

57
00:04:43,074 --> 00:04:46,536
was accused of sexually assaulting
his followers and embezzling church funds

58
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:49,789
and has been under investigation
since 1999.

59
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:55,420
When the news came out,
on that very same afternoon

60
00:04:56,087 --> 00:04:58,756
he fled to Seoul through the mountain
behind Wolmyeongdong.

61
00:05:02,885 --> 00:05:07,223
The day after that,
he fled straight to Hong Kong.

62
00:05:14,188 --> 00:05:19,402
When we get to the year 1999,
I'll go into my tomb phase.

63
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:23,614
Jesus conducted public ministry
for three years and died.

64
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:25,783
Like the tomb phase, right?

65
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:28,786
I said I'd be entering
my tomb phase in 1999

66
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,872
after my ministry of providence.

67
00:05:30,955 --> 00:05:32,832
After ten years of my work,

68
00:05:32,915 --> 00:05:37,337
I told my disciples that there will be
great turmoil and difficulties in 1999…

69
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,380
"We are the subjects of God, indeed."

70
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:42,633
"Just look at us,
going through turmoil and persecution."

71
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,263
"Our heavenly Father!"

72
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:51,559
"Those ignorant men
are trying to crucify our president!"

73
00:05:51,642 --> 00:05:54,937
"Father! Please free our president!"

74
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:58,024
"Please prove his innocence!"

75
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:06,949
We gathered the former followers
of Jeong Myeong-seok

76
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:10,912
and filed a lawsuit against him
for rape, kidnapping, and so on.

77
00:06:10,995 --> 00:06:13,373
So we've sued Jeong Myeong-seok
in the criminal court.

78
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:15,917
We proceeded with the civil lawsuit
at the same time.

79
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:20,838
Now, I would really love
to do some work overseas.

80
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:23,674
Do you understand?
I need to go overseas and work there too.

81
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:25,718
I wasn't sent for this country only.

82
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:29,180
The Gospel is for the entire world.
I must fulfill my duty.

83
00:06:29,263 --> 00:06:31,265
He said he was going
on an overseas mission.

84
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:33,851
But frankly, he just fled
to another country.

85
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:36,312
But those people called it
an overseas mission trip.

86
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:44,779
After it was reported that
a female follower was kidnapped and beaten

87
00:06:44,862 --> 00:06:47,740
by a religious organization
called East West Christian Union,

88
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:51,661
MBC began to receive calls from people
who claimed to be victims as well.

89
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:54,872
It was revealed that they have a history
of indiscriminately beating

90
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:57,542
those who left or criticized
the organization.

91
00:06:57,625 --> 00:07:00,503
They would say my criticisms
were groundless

92
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:02,630
and beat me up ruthlessly.

93
00:07:02,713 --> 00:07:04,048
FORMER MEMBER

94
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:10,513
PICTURE OF THE INFORMER AFTER THE ASSAULT

95
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:26,863
My name is Kim Do-hyeong.

96
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:30,533
Currently, I'm a mathematics professor
at Dankook University,

97
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:33,786
teaching students
and also conducting research.

98
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:38,124
After Ms. Hwang's kidnapping case
got exposed in January 1999,

99
00:07:38,749 --> 00:07:42,003
I created a website around February.

100
00:07:42,086 --> 00:07:44,338
Many former followers of JMS
visited that site

101
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:47,717
and started talking to each other.

102
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,720
Then some people started to get together
through the website.

103
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:55,099
PROSECUTE THE SEX-CRAZED CULT LEADER
JEONG MYEONG-SEOK!

104
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:56,601
Those get-togethers evolved

105
00:07:56,684 --> 00:07:59,562
from social gatherings
to a fierce activist organization

106
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:00,771
PROSECUTE JMS!

107
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:05,651
1999
FLEEING OVERSEAS

108
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:12,825
1995
FIRST ENCOUNTER WITH JMS

109
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:16,078
After I finished two years
of science high school,

110
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:21,083
I got into KAIST as a double major
in mathematics and physics.

111
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:31,427
I first attended a JMS church
in the spring before my graduation.

112
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:36,724
There, I heard Jeong Myeong-seok

113
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:41,771
refer to the Grand Canyon
as the Grand Bitch.

114
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:44,857
"Let all the professors of the country
come and learn from me."

115
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:46,776
He said those vulgar words.

116
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:50,446
So I was just completely
speechless and dumbfounded.

117
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:53,616
But his followers seemed so blessed
by what he said.

118
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:55,576
They kept saying, "Amen!"

119
00:08:55,660 --> 00:09:00,206
That's when I first realized
that this group was far from being sane.

120
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,126
The king loved his queen.

121
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:08,172
He loved her, so he called her,
but she didn't come.

122
00:09:09,173 --> 00:09:12,218
He was so offended, so he just told her
to go back to her home.

123
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:15,680
He said, "Hey, you bitch.
You're a nobody."

124
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:18,099
That's not the only thing he said.

125
00:09:18,182 --> 00:09:20,685
He also said,
"You damned bitch. You dog of a woman."

126
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:22,770
He said all sorts of things
when he got angry.

127
00:09:22,853 --> 00:09:23,980
But not in the Bible.

128
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:26,732
This is why my teachings
are more realistic.

129
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:28,776
I'm telling you what really happened.

130
00:09:28,859 --> 00:09:29,860
Okay?

131
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:32,238
I got the feeling that

132
00:09:32,321 --> 00:09:34,240
he was undermining the holiness of Jesus.

133
00:09:34,323 --> 00:09:38,619
And I realized his doctrine was different
from the doctrines of normal churches.

134
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:53,801
One day, my girlfriend told me

135
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:56,971
that the president had held her once.

136
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,892
I asked her what she meant.

137
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:06,522
She was quiet for a while
before simply saying,

138
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,274
"A memoir from Modern Religion."

139
00:10:08,357 --> 00:10:10,192
MEMOIR OF A SEXUAL HARASSMENT VICTIM
MODERN RELIGION MONTHLY, 1984

140
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:11,861
WHO DO YOU THINK I AM?

141
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:14,196
JEONG MYEONG-SEOK OF AECHEON CHURCH
CLAIMS THAT HE IS THE MESSIAH

142
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:18,659
There was an institute, Modern Religion,
which conducted research on cults.

143
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:22,330
They had a memoir of a female student
who was sexually assaulted

144
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:23,956
by Jeong Myeong-seok in 1983.

145
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:27,209
HIS HANDS KEPT CREEPING CLOSER TO ME

146
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:29,378
THEN THEY QUICKLY WENT UNDER MY BRA

147
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:32,548
AND STARTED FONDLING MY BREASTS
I INSTINCTIVELY MOVED AWAY

148
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:35,217
JEONG MYEONG-SEOK SLAPPED ME
AND TOLD ME TO STAY STILL

149
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:36,927
THEN PULLED ME CLOSER TO HIM

150
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:40,514
The fact that a cult
specializing in sex crimes

151
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:46,437
had infiltrated all the universities
in Korea disguised as clubs.

152
00:10:47,688 --> 00:10:49,315
It was incredulous.

153
00:10:52,109 --> 00:10:55,071
So I thought, "I can't let this asshole
get away with it."

154
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:01,160
I continued to search for victims.

155
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:05,122
The youngest victims
were in elementary or middle school.

156
00:11:06,248 --> 00:11:08,250
The age of the victims did not stop him.

157
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:13,089
AFFIDAVIT

158
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:14,340
STATEMENT BY L
SUBMITTED IN 2001

159
00:11:14,423 --> 00:11:16,592
HE SAID THAT AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOLER
REALLY LIKED HIM

160
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:18,886
AND PUT HIS HAND INSIDE THE CHILD'S PANTS
IN FRONT OF MANY WOMEN

161
00:11:18,969 --> 00:11:20,388
EXAMINATION RECORD OF S IN 2001

162
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:22,682
JEONG WAS SEX-OBSESSED
AND HE EVEN VICTIMIZED KIDS

163
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:26,435
I asked her if she could testify
about the sexual harassment and assaults,

164
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:29,438
but she said she'd die if she testified.

165
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:31,857
She asked me if I'd be responsible
for her life.

166
00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:36,237
Though many women want to sue
Jeong Myeong-seok,

167
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,739
I heard they still can't to this day.
Why is that?

168
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:40,074
He threatens to kill.

169
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:43,035
I heard they came to her house
yesterday too.

170
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:45,871
I thought,
"This bastard really deserves to die."

171
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:47,164
"He's not even human."

172
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:53,254
So, I actually called a gun store

173
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:56,757
and asked for the price of a shotgun.

174
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:59,635
I think that was in 1996 or 1997.

175
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:02,513
The shotgun cost
around 800,000 won back then.

176
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:15,609
That was the first time in my life
when I genuinely wanted to kill someone.

177
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:21,407
In JMS, they talk about Kim Do-hyeong
like he's the Devil.

178
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:23,075
FORMER JMS MEMBER

179
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:24,368
And that's because

180
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:29,081
he called Wolmyeongdong
and started swearing.

181
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:32,626
When they pick up, I'd say,
"Hey, let me talk to Jeong, that asshole."

182
00:12:33,544 --> 00:12:36,630
Then they'd say, "How dare you call
our president an asshole?"

183
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:42,720
I'd say "He might be Resurrected Jesus
to you, but he's just a horny dog to me."

184
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:45,306
"So just get him on the phone,
you asshole."

185
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:50,352
Kim Do-hyeong really did seem
like the Devil incarnate.

186
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:56,442
I'm sure that everybody at the Providence
heard this countless times.

187
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:59,111
Kim Do-hyeong and the Exodus.

188
00:13:00,237 --> 00:13:03,616
"Kim Do-hyeong equals Satan."
That's what we thought.

189
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:08,621
I go through so much turmoil and hardship,

190
00:13:08,704 --> 00:13:14,210
but they just slander me behind my back,
saying that I should be killed.

191
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:16,295
The ones under the power of Satan.

192
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:19,381
Why should we have any sympathy for them?

193
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:22,676
How low must they be to follow Satan?
Filthy and disgusting.

194
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:26,555
1995
FIRST ENCOUNTER WITH JMS

195
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:32,686
1999
WORLD MISSION TRIP

196
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:38,484
While he traveled around the world
after he left Korea,

197
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:41,654
he called women over
and had sex with them.

198
00:13:42,863 --> 00:13:46,951
He even did things
to local college students.

199
00:13:47,743 --> 00:13:48,744
When he went abroad,

200
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:51,330
he became the epitome of promiscuousness.

201
00:13:51,413 --> 00:13:53,249
He has built these extravagant palaces.

202
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:58,337
We're currently in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia,

203
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,507
at a hotel swimming pool.

204
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:08,514
He rented out an entire resort

205
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:12,226
and brought his women over from Korea.

206
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:15,521
They went to the beach,
and it was all about having fun.

207
00:14:15,604 --> 00:14:18,023
It was all about just playing around
and having sex.

208
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:22,570
You know, it's the type of fun
that Jeong Myeong-seok would like.

209
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:24,113
That's exactly what it was.

210
00:14:25,739 --> 00:14:28,784
He started traveling
to different countries again.

211
00:14:29,326 --> 00:14:30,494
As he was doing so,

212
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:33,163
he became a huge problem
in the Taiwanese society.

213
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:36,208
TAIWAN

214
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:37,459
It was around November.

215
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:41,881
An article was written on a cult leader
from Korea, Jeong Myeong-seok,

216
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:45,384
and his group raping
and sexually harassing 100 female students

217
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:46,969
KIM HONG-IL
ANTI-JMS ACTIVIST

218
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:49,305
who were studying
at Chengchi University in Taiwan.

219
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:51,223
A CULT LEADER LURED
AROUND 100 FEMALE STUDENTS

220
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:53,767
FROM NATIONAL TAIWAN UNIVERSITY
AND NATIONAL CHENGCHI UNIVERSITY

221
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:55,060
AND SEXUALLY ASSAULTED THEM

222
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,191
The news that Korea's JMS
had committed such a crime in Taiwan…

223
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:04,361
SANG JI-YE MEI, FORMER HEAD
ASSOCIATION OF INTEGRITY OF RELIGION

224
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:09,658
…was a big shock to the Taiwanese society.

225
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:13,078
JMS was usually active in the campus

226
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:16,832
of National Taiwan University.

227
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:21,003
Let's look at the number of victims.

228
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:27,843
The number of women who have been affected
by the JMS incidence

229
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:33,933
came to a total
of around 100 female students.

230
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:38,979
Most of these women were college students.

231
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:43,484
Put it this way, it's like a Taiwanese
or Chinese cult leader coming to Korea

232
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:48,405
and raping 100 female college students
from SNU, Yonsei, and Korea University.

233
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:50,616
The entire nation would be in an uproar.

234
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:56,121
The stories of the Taiwanese victims
are completely identical

235
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:58,040
to what happened in Korea.

236
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:02,378
He took advantage of them
under the guise of private meetings.

237
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:09,885
Hong Kong was the quickest place
he could flee to without a visa.

238
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:12,638
So he fled to Hong Kong right away.

239
00:16:16,892 --> 00:16:21,647
HONG KONG

240
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:24,692
This is Hong Kong.

241
00:16:24,775 --> 00:16:30,072
I can see a building above me
that looks like a monkey climbing a tree.

242
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:32,032
It's like a koala is climbing…

243
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:35,953
You can see that those buildings
look like monkeys climbing a tree.

244
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:41,333
Well, since he traveled
to all those different countries

245
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:42,835
to hide from the authorities,

246
00:16:42,918 --> 00:16:45,254
he ran out of pages on his passport.

247
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:50,300
Actually, if you just visit the Consulate

248
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:54,388
and ask for more pages on the passport,
they will extend it for you.

249
00:16:54,471 --> 00:16:55,806
That's the normal procedure.

250
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:59,309
He must've had a guilty conscience.

251
00:16:59,893 --> 00:17:03,355
He brought a very expensive crystal gift
to the Consulate, apparently.

252
00:17:05,649 --> 00:17:09,445
They were suspicious as he gave them
a valuable gift for simple paperwork.

253
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:15,159
So they looked into him, and found out
there was a warrant out for his arrest.

254
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:17,953
His background check showed
that his proceedings have stayed.

255
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:21,582
After that, his passport was probably
taken away right on the spot.

256
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:24,752
They told him he had to return
to Korea immediately

257
00:17:24,835 --> 00:17:27,546
and were issuing
a travel certificate for him.

258
00:17:27,629 --> 00:17:30,007
But Jeong Myeong-seok just ran away.

259
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:32,801
He slipped out of the Consulate.

260
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:39,016
In October 2002, an SBS show called
Unanswered Questions made a report

261
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:43,103
with the title, "Jeong Myeong-seok's
Overseas Sex Scandals."

262
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:46,857
So 10,000 JMS members
gathered in Yeouido to protest.

263
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:51,987
We didn't think, "They put us on TV
because we did something wrong."

264
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:56,492
We thought the devils were using
the power of the media to persecute us.

265
00:17:57,159 --> 00:18:00,162
I even thought about riding
in a hot air balloon

266
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:02,915
with a gas barrel on my back

267
00:18:02,998 --> 00:18:06,502
and crashing through the windows
of an SBS building to blow myself up.

268
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:08,587
To stop the broadcast.

269
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:14,051
One of the newspapers published an article
with a picture of the protesters.

270
00:18:14,134 --> 00:18:16,178
There was this girl at the very front,

271
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:21,350
and she was protesting very passionately
in that picture.

272
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:25,145
The one who was on the front line
of the protests

273
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:27,689
to fiercely defend
her president's innocence

274
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:29,817
goes to Hong Kong

275
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:34,279
only three months later, to find out
exactly what kind of person Jeong was.

276
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:47,417
2003
SEXUAL ASSAULT IN HONG KONG

277
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:53,841
At the time, Jeong Myeong-seok
was out of the country.

278
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:03,058
So he used to call me and tell me
to come overseas to see him,

279
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:05,185
on multiple occasions.

280
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:09,022
Getting a phone call from him

281
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:13,819
was considered a great honor
among his followers.

282
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:19,158
The Hong Kong victims were sisters.

283
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:22,369
They were told not to watch
the TV broadcasts,

284
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:24,496
as watching them will negate
their salvation.

285
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:27,875
They were thoroughly forbidden like this,

286
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:31,420
so they had never seen the TV programs
until after they were assaulted.

287
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:34,256
That's when Jeong Myeong-seok
called for them.

288
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:37,009
Maybe they thought,
"Great, since he was falsely accused,

289
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:40,137
I'll go and experience firsthand
that he's not a person like that."

290
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:42,931
"Then I will become his witness."

291
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:49,104
HONG KONG

292
00:19:57,279 --> 00:20:02,117
They said we should give the president
a massage since he was tired.

293
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:08,332
Before we knew it,
they put us into his room.

294
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:13,837
And Jeong Myeong-seok was lying
in the middle of his bed.

295
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:17,799
He spread his arms and told us
to lie down on either side of him.

296
00:20:22,512 --> 00:20:26,141
As it was an order from the Messiah,
we couldn't disobey him.

297
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:31,146
Though it was awkward, we laid down
on each side as we were told to do.

298
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:37,194
Then, I think I must have fallen asleep.

299
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:44,952
I think Jeong Myeong-seok
thought I was asleep.

300
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:49,498
He took off my sister's underwear
in the dark,

301
00:20:49,998 --> 00:20:53,752
suddenly spread her legs, and humped her.

302
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:56,546
He said that it was the Lord's will.

303
00:20:57,547 --> 00:20:59,007
That he didn't have to do it.

304
00:20:59,883 --> 00:21:03,637
But that my body wouldn't be saved
if he didn't do it.

305
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:08,475
Only then did I realize that the posts
on the Exodus website

306
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:12,854
were true, and it was horrifying.

307
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:16,566
HONG KONG VICTIM'S STATEMENT
MADE TO THE POLICE IN MARCH 2003

308
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:18,360
HE TOOK OFF MY SISTER'S UNDERWEAR
IN THE DARK

309
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:20,028
HE DID SOMETHING WITH HIS HANDS FOR A BIT

310
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:21,863
THEN HE SPREAD MY SISTER'S LEGS
AND HUMPED HER

311
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:24,157
I WAS PRETENDING TO BE ASLEEP
BUT I WAS COMPLETELY SHOCKED

312
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:27,744
Something that she had only heard about
was actually happening to her.

313
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:31,498
And the reporters were sleeping
in the room right next to them.

314
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:34,584
She opened the door to ask for help,

315
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:38,422
but they were all pretending to be asleep
like everything was perfectly fine.

316
00:21:38,505 --> 00:21:40,966
Nobody woke up to acknowledge her.

317
00:21:42,926 --> 00:21:45,178
Then she realized,
"Oh, they're all in on it."

318
00:21:45,887 --> 00:21:49,016
"If they find out
that I think of this as rape,

319
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:51,101
or if I show any signs of suspicion,

320
00:21:51,184 --> 00:21:53,854
I might actually be killed
without anyone knowing."

321
00:21:53,937 --> 00:21:56,231
That's the kind of horror they felt.

322
00:21:56,315 --> 00:22:02,321
So, they spent a few days there,
pretending that they were fine.

323
00:22:02,404 --> 00:22:05,782
As soon as they came back to Korea,
she called Professor Kim Do-hyeong.

324
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:08,952
And that's how she was able to connect
with Exodus right away.

325
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:12,622
He's not a human being.

326
00:22:13,915 --> 00:22:17,669
He had a warrant out for his sex crimes,
and the legal proceedings had been stayed,

327
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:21,465
but he called more of his female followers
from Korea and raped them again.

328
00:22:22,215 --> 00:22:24,426
A human being can't do
something like that.

WORLD MISSION TRIP

330
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:35,896
2006
THE HONG KONG X-FILE

331
00:22:35,979 --> 00:22:37,314
The Hong Kong X-File.

332
00:22:37,981 --> 00:22:39,232
If you look at it,

333
00:22:39,316 --> 00:22:42,611
there's so much information on it,
a massive amount.

334
00:22:44,946 --> 00:22:49,618
He got his reports over email
while he was there.

335
00:22:50,827 --> 00:22:53,997
The Internet was what kept
Jeong Myeong-seok alive, really.

336
00:23:15,685 --> 00:23:19,106
At the time, I graduated from college,
so I had to look for a job.

337
00:23:19,189 --> 00:23:23,276
That's when Pastor Kim called me
from Hong Kong and told me

338
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,696
that there was a liaison office
in Hong Kong for Jeong Myeong-seok.

339
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:28,740
He asked me if I wanted to work there.

340
00:23:29,449 --> 00:23:32,119
I thought, "Let's do something great
for the Messiah."

341
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:36,665
It was at a mansion on Kimberly Road,

342
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:40,210
in the Kowloon area of Hong Kong.

343
00:23:42,003 --> 00:23:44,714
Back then, the kind of work I did

344
00:23:45,465 --> 00:23:49,136
was to receive letters, parcels,
and other luggage from Korea.

345
00:23:49,219 --> 00:23:50,887
You know, those kinds of things.

346
00:23:50,971 --> 00:23:55,142
Then I forwarded them to places in China,
like Shenzhen.

347
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:59,729
I didn't know exactly
where Jeong Myeong-seok was at first.

348
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:04,192
After a while, it started looking
like he was in China.

349
00:24:05,193 --> 00:24:09,030
I was told to open up every single package
from Korea and check the contents.

350
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:13,326
There were these round storage tubes
for posters.

351
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:15,537
So I opened them and looked inside,

352
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:20,083
and there were pictures of women posing.

353
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:23,295
But those women were always topless

354
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:25,630
and just revealing everything.

355
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:28,675
I saw a lot of those pictures,
all rolled up in a bundle,

356
00:24:28,758 --> 00:24:30,135
and thought, "What's this?"

357
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:35,807
Once, they told everybody to come
and get their pictures taken.

358
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:38,768
The reporters called these girls
from different regions.

359
00:24:38,852 --> 00:24:41,354
I also went to the studio
to get my pictures taken.

360
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:46,026
I made an album with photos of me
wearing a dress and sent it.

361
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:56,745
They made me take pictures
in my underwear.

362
00:24:56,828 --> 00:25:02,000
I remember that the extent gradually
became more intense.

363
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,424
Taking all the clothes off
would earn an A rating.

364
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:12,928
An A rating if you could get naked
in front of Jeong Myeong-seok.

365
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:17,807
Also if you could have sex
with Jeong Myeong-seok.

366
00:25:18,308 --> 00:25:22,229
If you wore a bikini, you were rated as B.

367
00:25:22,312 --> 00:25:23,563
Or a dress too.

368
00:25:26,441 --> 00:25:32,906
Around then, sexy lingerie and swimsuits
were sent out by Jeong Myeong-seok.

369
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:35,700
"Send me a picture
since you got it as a gift."

370
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:37,118
That's what he used to say.

371
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:40,997
So, all the girls would take pictures
and videos of themselves at the time.

372
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:53,677
Honey.

373
00:25:58,181 --> 00:26:00,934
This pretty fruit is all for you, my Lord.

374
00:26:01,017 --> 00:26:03,019
Enjoy, my Lord.

375
00:26:03,103 --> 00:26:06,356
Those videos were for introducing
reporters to Jeong Myeong-seok.

376
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:11,778
They probably sent videos
of themselves masturbating to Jeong.

377
00:26:11,861 --> 00:26:13,405
He told them to send

378
00:26:13,488 --> 00:26:17,200
close-up shots of their genitals
with their legs put together.

379
00:26:19,035 --> 00:26:22,747
I love you, honey!

380
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:27,210
Because he couldn't call in
female followers all the time,

381
00:26:27,294 --> 00:26:29,879
he would always watch those videos.

382
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:34,718
If he saw a pretty woman, he called
and told her to come and see him.

383
00:26:35,468 --> 00:26:37,262
Then he raped her.

384
00:26:38,346 --> 00:26:40,890
RECORDING OF A CALL BETWEEN JEONG
AND A FEMALE FOLLOWER IN FEB 2003

385
00:26:40,974 --> 00:26:42,684
-Is this **?
-Yes, it is.

386
00:26:43,184 --> 00:26:44,102
Hey.

387
00:26:45,645 --> 00:26:47,480
You want to see me, don't you?

388
00:26:47,564 --> 00:26:48,732
Pardon?

389
00:26:48,815 --> 00:26:51,067
-You want to see me too, don't you?
-Of course.

390
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:55,363
-I saw your picture yesterday.
-Yes.

391
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:57,616
Others said you're prettier in person.

392
00:26:57,699 --> 00:26:58,533
Sorry?

393
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:00,994
They said you're prettier in person.

394
00:27:01,077 --> 00:27:02,912
Oh, my. Thank you.

395
00:27:03,496 --> 00:27:08,293
You know that gift you sent me before?

396
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:09,628
-Yeah?
-Yes.

397
00:27:09,711 --> 00:27:13,256
I was going to thank you for that…

398
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:16,134
When a man gives you underwear,

399
00:27:16,217 --> 00:27:18,345
it's like you basically gave him
your body.

400
00:27:18,428 --> 00:27:19,929
Oh, really?

401
00:27:20,013 --> 00:27:23,433
That means that I love you.
So, don't tell anybody.

402
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:27,646
Giving underwear as a gift
means we're already like lovers.

403
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:33,693
Come if you want.
What are you going to do here?

404
00:27:33,777 --> 00:27:34,736
Sorry?

405
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:37,113
What are you going to do here?
Once we meet?

406
00:27:37,197 --> 00:27:39,115
I wanted to say hello to you.

407
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:41,409
-And?
-And listen to your sermons.

408
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:44,079
And? No time even for sermons,
so come quickly.

409
00:27:45,288 --> 00:27:48,792
Looking at those files, I realized
Jeong Myeong-seok truly is a sex offender.

410
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:52,754
I concluded that I had been wrong
about him all this time.

411
00:27:56,424 --> 00:27:58,259
After a year or so,

412
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:01,262
they said the Hong Kong office will close
as they're withdrawing.

413
00:28:02,138 --> 00:28:04,808
I removed the hard disk from the computer

414
00:28:04,891 --> 00:28:08,561
that was 5.25 inches and 500 GB,
and brought it back to Korea.

415
00:28:09,437 --> 00:28:12,107
These were the truth,
so I wanted the other victims

416
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:14,359
to see the truth
and leave the organization.

417
00:28:14,442 --> 00:28:18,279
So I uploaded all the files in the disk
to an online drive

418
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:19,948
and sent it to them as a reference.

419
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:21,866
The content was extremely extensive

420
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:24,160
and had so many materials.

421
00:28:24,244 --> 00:28:27,247
So the media dubbed it
the "Hong Kong X-File."

422
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:49,769
I used to look at Jeong Myeong-seok
and never stopped wondering,

423
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:52,313
"Just how many women
went through this place?"

424
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:55,400
According to a petition submitted
by JMS pastors of the early days,

425
00:28:55,483 --> 00:28:57,444
Jeong Myeong-seok said
something like this.

426
00:28:57,527 --> 00:29:00,155
"My goal is to rape 10,000 women."

427
00:29:00,655 --> 00:29:03,074
1999, A PETITION FROM SEVEN JMS PASTORS
WHO LEFT THE ORGANIZATION

428
00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:05,577
COLLECTIVELY INDUCED AND ENCOURAGED
UNDER THEIR COOPERATION AND CONNIVANCE

429
00:29:07,537 --> 00:29:08,455
And he thinks…

430
00:29:10,707 --> 00:29:14,794
that he came very close
to achieving his goal, his dream.

431
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:27,390
2006
THE HONG KONG X-FILE

432
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:34,647
2003, ENCOUNTER WITH THE PRESIDENT
UNDER THE MOSQUITO NET IN JULY

433
00:29:34,731 --> 00:29:37,358
WANTED: JEONG MYEONG-SEOK
FOR RAPE, SEMI-FORCED HARASSMENT AND FRAUD

434
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:38,777
Even during his exile abroad,

435
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:42,781
more women testified that they had been
sexually assaulted by Jeong.

436
00:29:43,406 --> 00:29:47,202
Interpol placed him
on the Red Notice list in 2003.

437
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:51,039
We received a report around June 2003.

438
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:55,376
It said that the female officers
and pastors of JMS are heading

439
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:58,588
to Hong Kong to meet
with Jeong Myeong-seok.

440
00:29:59,255 --> 00:30:02,926
As the police and the prosecutors
weren't really interested anyway,

441
00:30:03,009 --> 00:30:04,594
we figured we should catch him.

442
00:30:05,428 --> 00:30:10,600
That's why some of the Exodus members
went to Hong Kong.

443
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:27,075
We were already waiting
at Hong Kong Airport.

444
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:33,456
When the female followers were leaving,
another team in Korea went to the airport

445
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:38,127
to see what they looked like
and what they were wearing.

446
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:42,257
They took zoomed-in pictures of them
with telephoto lenses.

447
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:47,595
ACTUAL PHOTOS OF FEMALE JMS PASTORS
TAKEN AT THE AIRPORT AT THE TIME

448
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,973
But when they actually arrived,

449
00:30:50,056 --> 00:30:52,100
the female pastors wore outfits

450
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:55,770
that were completely different
to the pictures from Korea.

451
00:30:56,604 --> 00:31:00,108
There was an incident
where we almost lost them.

452
00:31:01,442 --> 00:31:05,280
They were going to meet Jeong Myeong-seok
from Hong Kong Airport,

453
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:08,616
so they probably got changed
into prettier dresses.

454
00:31:11,911 --> 00:31:13,162
They exited the airport,

455
00:31:13,246 --> 00:31:19,961
then they got into the JMS van and Lexus
that were waiting for them.

456
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:25,550
From that moment, we started following
those JMS vehicles.

457
00:31:30,305 --> 00:31:32,307
As we were following them,

458
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:36,019
they started going up a mountain road
where there were no houses nearby.

459
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:40,732
There was a curve at the mountain ridge,

460
00:31:40,815 --> 00:31:42,650
so we followed the curve too.

461
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:47,947
There, it was the front yard of the villa
where Jeong Myeong-seok was staying.

462
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:54,370
First, it was important for us to check
that he was actually in the villa.

463
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:58,666
There was a mountain behind his villa,

464
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:02,545
so we approached the villa
through the mountain.

465
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:06,799
We saw Jeong Myeong-seok
taking a walk with his female followers.

466
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:14,057
As we were staking out the place,
the light on the second floor was on.

467
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:15,808
So, we were watching them.

468
00:32:16,684 --> 00:32:19,812
Three women were taking turns,

469
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:22,774
having sex with Jeong Myeong-seok
on the bed.

470
00:32:24,317 --> 00:32:28,446
After that, we went back and asked
for the immigration office's cooperation.

471
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:37,830
The very next day,

472
00:32:37,914 --> 00:32:41,793
around ten Hong Kong immigration officers
got on their microbus

473
00:32:41,876 --> 00:32:45,880
and headed for Clear Water Bay,
where Jeong Myeong-seok was hiding.

474
00:32:51,552 --> 00:32:55,348
The immigration officers entered
through the front door to arrest him,

475
00:32:55,431 --> 00:32:59,435
and we went up the mountain
to block his escape route.

476
00:33:00,395 --> 00:33:03,523
We found this mosquito net
we hadn't seen the day before

477
00:33:03,606 --> 00:33:07,026
where Jeong Myeong-seok was hanging out

478
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:10,071
with his female followers in swimsuits.

479
00:33:10,697 --> 00:33:13,616
FOOTAGE OF JEONG MYEONG-SEOK'S ARREST
FILMED BY KIM HYEONG-JIN

480
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:16,661
Don't touch that.
Put on your underwear and pants.

481
00:33:17,578 --> 00:33:19,455
Put them on and come out. Come out here.

482
00:33:20,581 --> 00:33:22,083
-Come out.
-What's coming out?

483
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:23,042
Get out, asshole.

484
00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:26,921
Come out before I kill you. All right?

485
00:33:28,464 --> 00:33:32,719
As Jeong Myeong-seok was in his underwear
with the female followers in swimsuits,

486
00:33:32,802 --> 00:33:34,387
it seems like he had an erection.

487
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:35,972
So he couldn't stand up straight.

488
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:41,936
I said, "Let's go to Korea. Come out."

489
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:46,607
Then, he said with this lisp,
"What's coming out?"

490
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:48,943
-Come out.
-What's coming out?

491
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:50,028
Come out, asshole.

492
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:57,493
Because I was filming with a camera,
I think he wanted to take it.

493
00:33:57,577 --> 00:33:59,328
He knocked my camera.

494
00:34:00,413 --> 00:34:02,415
What are you doing?
Why are you filming this?

495
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:05,084
-Huh? You kicked me?
-Hey, no. It's fine.

496
00:34:05,585 --> 00:34:06,419
Hey, you asshole.

497
00:34:06,502 --> 00:34:09,922
Hey, why are you putting your hands on me?
Why, huh?

498
00:34:10,006 --> 00:34:11,507
-Stay still.
-You grabbed me?

499
00:34:11,591 --> 00:34:13,134
-When did I do that?
-You just did.

500
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:16,429
You're the one grabbing me. Film this.
This asshole's grabbing my hand.

501
00:34:16,512 --> 00:34:17,847
You just grabbed me, right?

502
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:20,099
Hey, you asshole. Hey, damn it.

503
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:21,601
After he got slapped once,

504
00:34:21,684 --> 00:34:24,854
he started backing away,
saying, "You hit me?"

505
00:34:25,438 --> 00:34:27,231
Then he hurried away from us.

506
00:34:27,315 --> 00:34:28,441
Stay still.

507
00:34:28,524 --> 00:34:29,734
That was…

508
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:35,073
I thought, "Did I really spend
so much effort and time

509
00:34:35,156 --> 00:34:39,410
to catch such a pathetic
and cowardly person?"

510
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:40,787
It felt so futile.

511
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:49,420
The headline of a Hong Kong newspaper
was "Sex-crazed cult leader arrested."

512
00:34:49,504 --> 00:34:51,881
And the covers of the weekly papers read,

513
00:34:51,964 --> 00:34:54,425
"Sex-crazed cult leader
arrested in the field."

514
00:34:54,509 --> 00:35:00,098
SEX-CRAZED CULT LEADER
SURROUNDED IN THE FIELD

515
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:03,351
Jeong Myeong-seok was arrested,

516
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:04,519
so at the time,

517
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:07,855
we thought it was all over
since he had been caught.

518
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:14,403
We thought it'd be a matter of time
until he was brought back to Korea,

519
00:35:15,863 --> 00:35:18,074
but Jeong Myeong-seok,
who had been arrested…

520
00:35:19,033 --> 00:35:23,412
He hired a lawyer and was released
after paying a 100,000-dollar bail.

521
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:28,960
After that, he illegally crossed over
to China without a passport.

522

VIDEO OF JEONG MYEONG-SEOK
AFTER HE FLED TO CHINA

525
00:35:53,192 --> 00:35:54,026
Hallelujah.

526
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:59,949
"Evil people, ingrates,
and disloyal people cannot exist."

527
00:36:00,908 --> 00:36:02,368
That's what Jesus said to me.

528
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:06,414
"Do you think you can fight in a war
without any casualties? Huh?"

529
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:09,500
"Some killings are necessary."
That's what the Lord said.

530
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:15,089
I think the mosquito net incident

531
00:36:15,673 --> 00:36:17,425
was quite a big shock for them.

532
00:36:19,093 --> 00:36:21,095
What are you doing?
Why are you filming this?

533
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:23,723
-Huh? You kicked me?
-Hey, no. It's fine.

534
00:36:24,223 --> 00:36:25,224
Hey, you asshole.

535
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:28,144
Hey, why are you putting your hands on me?
Why, huh?

536
00:36:28,227 --> 00:36:29,979
People at JMS probably thought,

537
00:36:30,062 --> 00:36:33,566
"How dare they do that to the Messiah?"

538
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:36,068
So they were really enraged.

539
00:36:36,652 --> 00:36:40,781
They couldn't just sit and watch
the Lord getting beaten up like that.

540
00:36:41,282 --> 00:36:44,869
So when Jeong Myeong-seok was beaten up,
they became very hostile

541
00:36:44,952 --> 00:36:47,705
as if their parents were beaten up,
or even worse.

542
00:36:48,956 --> 00:36:53,044
After the indoctrination, the followers
became Jeong Myeong-seok's loyal subjects.

543
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:55,213
During his sermons, he'd say,

544
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:59,967
"There are many foxtails. We cannot farm
with too many foxtails in the fields."

545
00:37:00,635 --> 00:37:02,303
He'd talk like that in his sermons.

546
00:37:02,386 --> 00:37:04,764
"Oh, we need to pull out
all the foxtails."

547
00:37:04,847 --> 00:37:06,807
"It means we must get rid of them."

548
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:09,936
"We must start the fox hunt now."

549
00:37:10,019 --> 00:37:12,480
"In order to serve and assist the Lord,

550
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:15,399
we'll exterminate Kim Do-hyeong
if it's necessary."

551
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:18,152
EXTERMINATE ALL THREATS
TO PROTECT THE LORD OF THIS ERA

552
00:37:23,616 --> 00:37:28,079
JEONJU

553
00:37:30,831 --> 00:37:35,378
The threatening calls I had been receiving

554
00:37:35,461 --> 00:37:38,547
started coming from Jeolla-do only.

555
00:37:38,631 --> 00:37:44,637
Then finally, the calls started coming
from the payphones in my school.

556
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:49,183
That's when I felt like they were starting
to close in on me, unlike before.

557
00:37:53,062 --> 00:37:55,690
It was before my graduation,

558
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:58,651
so I was living
in a small studio apartment at the time.

559
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:01,654
One day, I came through the front door,

560
00:38:01,737 --> 00:38:03,864
but the motion sensor light
didn't come on.

561
00:38:04,448 --> 00:38:09,203
I thought it was probably broken,
so I just walked up to the second floor.

562
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:12,707
But this motion sensor light
didn't come on either.

563
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:13,624
At that moment,

564
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:19,130
somebody suddenly came running down
from this side,

565
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:22,341
and I felt something flash in front of me.

566
00:38:25,428 --> 00:38:28,764
Luckily, I was carrying
my Criminal Procedure Law textbook,

567
00:38:28,848 --> 00:38:31,058
so I instinctively raised it
to defend myself.

568
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:34,270
Later, I realized
that it was a steel pipe.

569
00:38:35,396 --> 00:38:39,900
Also, the attackers were only aiming
for my head.

570
00:38:43,779 --> 00:38:46,282
I thought that I couldn't let it continue.

571
00:38:46,365 --> 00:38:49,493
So, I grabbed the attacker
and rolled together to the side.

572
00:38:55,624 --> 00:38:58,711
So, we all ended up outside the building.

573
00:38:58,794 --> 00:39:01,255
There was a streetlamp
outside the building.

574
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:04,342
The moment their faces became visible,

575
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:06,761
as if they planned beforehand,

576
00:39:06,844 --> 00:39:08,971
they scattered all at once and ran for it.

577
00:39:10,723 --> 00:39:14,435
EMAIL WRITTEN BY SHIN, A JMS ATTACKER

578
00:39:14,518 --> 00:39:18,105
OH, AND FIVE PEOPLE ON OUR SIDE
ATTACKED A FOX YESTERDAY

579
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:21,067
THEY'RE GETTING FURIOUS
ON THEIR WEBSITE, IT'S CHAOTIC

580
00:39:21,859 --> 00:39:28,282
YONGIN

581
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,869
I told my parents too.

582
00:39:32,912 --> 00:39:34,413
"Don't go out late at night."

583
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:40,002
"Also, these people are nuts,
so I won't be coming home for a while."

584
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:57,561
I was on a call with my father,

585
00:39:58,270 --> 00:40:00,398
and I asked him where he was
as a greeting.

586
00:40:01,357 --> 00:40:03,609
He told me that he was almost home.

587
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:10,408
All of a sudden during the call,

588
00:40:11,826 --> 00:40:14,870
my father suddenly screamed
very frantically,

589
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:18,290
"What are you doing?
What on earth are you doing?"

590
00:40:20,793 --> 00:40:24,380
I said, "Hello? Dad?"
But he didn't say anything.

591
00:40:25,548 --> 00:40:29,009
I wondered why he was saying,
"What are you doing?"

592
00:40:30,344 --> 00:40:33,806
So I called him back,
but he didn't pick up.

593
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:48,571
They jabbed me in the face
with steel pipes.

594
00:40:49,071 --> 00:40:50,906
That's when this bone got fractured.

595
00:40:52,158 --> 00:40:55,870
My mouth was twisted to the side,
and I can't close one of my eyes.

596
00:40:59,081 --> 00:41:00,499
KIM MIN-SEOK, AGE 81

597
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:03,919
VICTIM OF ATTACK
PROFESSOR KIM DO-HYEONG'S FATHER

598
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:14,054
It happened in the summer,
all at the same place.

599
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:18,976
I was speaking on my cell phone,

600
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:26,192
and they came in front of my car,
making me stop.

601
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:34,158
They had these long sticks, clubs,
and baseball bats. Things like that.

602
00:41:35,576 --> 00:41:37,661
They started to smash my car with them.

603
00:41:40,789 --> 00:41:43,000
I said, "Who the hell are you?"

604
00:41:43,083 --> 00:41:47,171
The window on the driver's side
was open, that glass window.

605
00:41:47,963 --> 00:41:49,256
And through the window,

606
00:41:50,549 --> 00:41:54,220
they started jabbing
because it was too narrow to swing at me.

607
00:41:57,223 --> 00:41:59,475
I was inside the car,
so my lower body was fine.

608
00:41:59,558 --> 00:42:01,685
But it was mainly my face and chest.

609
00:42:04,647 --> 00:42:07,483
I don't think it even took five minutes.

610
00:42:07,566 --> 00:42:09,610
I was beaten until I got knocked out.

611
00:42:09,693 --> 00:42:11,904
I just passed out.

612
00:42:18,244 --> 00:42:24,083
ACTUAL PHOTO OF MIN-SEOK'S CAR
AFTER THE ATTACK

613
00:42:33,842 --> 00:42:34,885
So, my brother

614
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:39,431
went up to my father and held his face,

615
00:42:40,432 --> 00:42:42,768
and he said
this side of his face felt squishy.

616
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:46,522
So he lifted the towel to look, and…

617
00:42:51,277 --> 00:42:53,404
He actually had a hole in his face.

618
00:42:53,487 --> 00:42:58,993
I saw it too,
and there was a hole as big as a baseball.

619
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:02,913
The doctor said

620
00:43:02,997 --> 00:43:07,001
that all the veins on the left side
of his face had been severed.

621
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:11,213
He told us he might be presumptuous,
but my father had been very lucky.

622
00:43:19,388 --> 00:43:20,472
Then, my father said,

623
00:43:21,890 --> 00:43:25,102
"If I wasn't attacked,
my son would've been assaulted like this."

624
00:43:25,978 --> 00:43:28,147
"I'm glad it happened to me instead."

625
00:43:28,856 --> 00:43:30,232
That's what he said.

626
00:43:37,072 --> 00:43:39,074
Of course. I'm very grateful.

627
00:43:40,367 --> 00:43:44,079
I thank God that I was attacked
instead of my son.

628
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:53,881
-You need to take the white pills only.
-What?

629
00:43:53,964 --> 00:43:56,008
-Only take the white pills.
-Okay.

630
00:43:56,091 --> 00:43:57,885
Don't take the yellow ones.

631
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:07,811
For a while, after that happened,

632
00:44:08,604 --> 00:44:11,649
I really regretted going up
against Jeong Myeong-seok.

633
00:44:17,154 --> 00:44:18,989
How could a human being do such a thing?

634
00:44:19,073 --> 00:44:21,784
Even gangsters would understand
how precious family is.

635
00:44:28,374 --> 00:44:32,461
FOX HUNT PLAN

636
00:44:32,544 --> 00:44:37,466
EVIDENCE CONFISCATED BY THE POLICE
AFTER THE INCIDENT

637
00:44:37,549 --> 00:44:41,303
They were planning to attack me,
but there was no way for them to find me.

638
00:44:41,804 --> 00:44:44,014
So they decided to attack
my father instead.

639
00:44:45,891 --> 00:44:50,396
There were active prosecutors
among the JMS members, too.

640
00:44:50,896 --> 00:44:53,482
It's easy for them
to get information about someone.

641
00:44:54,566 --> 00:44:57,361
In a notebook
the police confiscated from the attackers,

642
00:44:57,444 --> 00:45:00,614
my entire family's names,
resident registration numbers, addresses,

643
00:45:00,698 --> 00:45:03,492
and even license plate numbers
were written down.

644
00:45:06,203 --> 00:45:10,124
They even bugged my parents' home.

645

CHINA

648
00:45:42,072 --> 00:45:44,158
Jeong Myeong-seok told me
he was in China…

649
00:45:44,241 --> 00:45:47,453
SEXUAL VIOLENCE VICTIM LEE YUN-JU (ANONYM)
JOINED IN 1992, AGE 19 AT THE TIME

650
00:45:47,536 --> 00:45:49,163
…and told me to come to him.

651
00:45:49,246 --> 00:45:52,750
Another girl from the HQ
was in Beijing at the time.

652
00:45:52,833 --> 00:45:55,836
We rode in a car for a very long time.

653
00:45:55,919 --> 00:45:59,131
The road was super bumpy.
We just kept on driving.

654
00:46:00,382 --> 00:46:03,051
When we arrived there,
there were these huge gates,

655
00:46:03,135 --> 00:46:05,345
which opened when they said
we had arrived.

656
00:46:05,846 --> 00:46:08,849
We went in through those enormous gates
as they opened.

657
00:46:09,892 --> 00:46:12,019
In the building
where Jeong Myeong-seok stayed,

658
00:46:12,102 --> 00:46:15,439
there was a bathhouse downstairs
in the basement.

659
00:46:16,023 --> 00:46:17,691
They washed us in the bathhouse,

660
00:46:17,775 --> 00:46:21,153
then took us to the dry sauna
where he raped us.

661
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:27,493
Then the week after,

662
00:46:28,327 --> 00:46:29,953
the Taekwondo incident happened.

663
00:46:30,996 --> 00:46:33,332
The founder of JMS, Jeong Myeong-seok,
who fled abroad

664
00:46:33,415 --> 00:46:35,793
after getting accused
of several sexual crimes,

665
00:46:35,876 --> 00:46:38,420
is now being accused
of sexually assaulting

666
00:46:38,504 --> 00:46:41,089
his female followers in China.

667
00:46:41,173 --> 00:46:44,676
The victims in China
were college students.

668
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:49,765
They were members
of the JMS taekwondo demonstration team.

669
00:46:49,848 --> 00:46:53,519
He invited them to China saying

670
00:46:53,602 --> 00:46:56,772
that they'd be performing
a taekwondo demonstration in China.

671
00:46:56,855 --> 00:47:00,442
Because he had already been caught
in Hong Kong once before,

672
00:47:00,526 --> 00:47:03,529
he was being very careful with security.

673
00:47:03,612 --> 00:47:06,073
I had no idea.
They didn't tell me anything.

674
00:47:06,573 --> 00:47:10,494
I got on the boat, and I saw this sign
as we were getting off.

675
00:47:10,577 --> 00:47:13,747
"Welcome to Dalian." So it was Dalian.

676
00:47:13,831 --> 00:47:17,876
After arriving in Dalian, China,
she managed to figure out her location

677
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:20,587
using a spoon wrapper
she took from a restaurant.

678
00:47:21,296 --> 00:47:23,215
She was in Anshan, Liaoning.

679
00:47:23,298 --> 00:47:25,342
It had Anshan written on it.
That's how I knew.

680
00:47:25,425 --> 00:47:26,260
Yes, this is it.

681
00:47:26,343 --> 00:47:27,719
That was the biggest building,

682
00:47:27,803 --> 00:47:30,722
and there were three identical buildings
in the back there.

683
00:47:31,807 --> 00:47:34,309
Can I ask
where you were sexually assaulted?

684
00:47:34,393 --> 00:47:35,644
Right here.

685
00:47:36,311 --> 00:47:38,856
There was a dry sauna in the basement,

686
00:47:38,939 --> 00:47:42,651
and there were a bunch
of secret passageways in there.

687
00:47:42,734 --> 00:47:45,821
That very evening, the victim ended up

688
00:47:45,904 --> 00:47:51,618
getting raped so violently,
which was nothing short of sexual torture.

689
00:47:53,871 --> 00:47:57,541
Jeong Myeong-seok slapped
my buttocks and thighs,

690
00:47:58,125 --> 00:48:00,919
then he stuck the hose of the shower,

691
00:48:01,587 --> 00:48:06,049
which had hot water coming out,
into my vagina, along with his fingers.

692
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:11,263
But Jeong Myeong-seok
just told me to be quiet

693
00:48:11,847 --> 00:48:13,640
when I cried out in agony.

694
00:48:14,349 --> 00:48:20,105
He yelled at me that he'd rip my pussy
to do it if I didn't stay still,

695
00:48:20,188 --> 00:48:21,648
then he raped me.

696
00:48:23,859 --> 00:48:27,738
Jeong Myeong-seok ran away again
after the incident in China came to light.

697
00:48:28,238 --> 00:48:31,074
We couldn't track him anymore
after he moved his hideout.

698
00:48:33,035 --> 00:48:40,000
MARCH 2ND, 2006
SLEDDING WHILE IN HIDING

699
00:48:42,044 --> 00:48:44,713
Before all this snow melts away,

700
00:48:45,672 --> 00:48:50,761
I'm riding this sled
you guys sent me from Korea.

701
00:48:51,511 --> 00:48:58,477
CHRISTMAS PARTY
WHILE JEONG MYEONG-SEOK WAS IN HIDING

702
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:06,944
So he moved locations, right?

703
00:49:07,027 --> 00:49:09,446
But even in 2006 and 2007,

704
00:49:09,529 --> 00:49:13,700
Jeong Myeong-seok kept bringing in women
from other places to have sex with them.

705
00:49:16,119 --> 00:49:18,330
Never give up your faith.
Keep it up till the end.

706
00:49:18,413 --> 00:49:20,832
Let's conquer the world.
Let's conquer it with love.

707
00:49:20,916 --> 00:49:22,000
Okay?

708
00:49:22,084 --> 00:49:24,711
Well, that's all I have for you today.
Bye, everyone.

709
00:49:26,046 --> 00:49:27,506
Goodbye.

710
00:49:28,966 --> 00:49:30,550
2006
HIDING

711
00:49:35,389 --> 00:49:38,892
2007
THE ARREST

712
00:49:39,685 --> 00:49:42,104
We got a call one day out of the blue

713
00:49:42,187 --> 00:49:45,065
from an external group of the Ministry
of State Security of China.

714
00:49:45,148 --> 00:49:47,192
The equivalent of South Korea's NIS.

715
00:49:47,943 --> 00:49:53,281
They called us and asked us
to come to China as soon as possible.

716
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:58,495
They were planning
a cultural exchange event

717
00:49:58,578 --> 00:50:00,080
between China and Korea,

718
00:50:00,163 --> 00:50:03,166
and they thought Jeong Myeong-seok
was likely to show up there.

719
00:50:15,470 --> 00:50:18,056
While he was being questioned
about his bigger crimes,

720
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:23,603
he tried to escape the questions
of the officer, acting insane and pitiful.
