5
00:00:18,059 --> 00:00:22,605
One day, we got a call
from China's Ministry of State Security.

6
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:24,315
The likes of South Korea's NIS.

7
00:00:24,816 --> 00:00:28,111
This external group of the Ministry
called and told us

8
00:00:28,194 --> 00:00:31,406
a man presumed to be Jeong Myeong-seok
was arrested in Beijing.

9
00:00:31,489 --> 00:00:35,160
He once had escaped the chase
from our public security officers.

10
00:00:36,786 --> 00:00:39,748
He managed to escape
through a secret passage,

11
00:00:39,831 --> 00:00:42,625
but he wasn't able to evade the law.

12
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:45,545
17 days later,
Jeong Myeong-seok was finally arrested

13
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:48,173
by public security officers
who were dispatched again.

14
00:00:48,256 --> 00:00:51,676
He was arrested in Beijing in May 2007.

15
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,970
JEONG MYEONG-SEOK ARRESTED
BY CHINESE PUBLIC SECURITY OFFICERS

16
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:55,722
It was really satisfying.

17
00:00:55,805 --> 00:00:57,724
So right after I got off the phone,

18
00:00:57,807 --> 00:01:00,685
I went out to a bar to have some drinks
as I was so happy.

19
00:01:01,811 --> 00:01:04,064
We were all celebrating.

20
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:09,903
After Jeong Myeong-seok was arrested,

21
00:01:09,986 --> 00:01:13,698
the demeanor of a cult's leader
was nowhere to be seen,

22
00:01:14,449 --> 00:01:21,247
and he was busy denying all his charges.

23
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:24,209
In the Bible, Jesus was always dignified.

24
00:01:24,709 --> 00:01:27,087
He never tried to make excuses
for his actions.

25
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:30,715
Jeong was arrested while on the run.

26
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,009
He took a completely
opposite path to Jesus.

27
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:39,682
He said he did not believe
he was the Messiah or the Lord.

28
00:01:40,391 --> 00:01:45,647
Instead, he kept repeating
that he was simply a pastor of a church.

29
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:50,276
While he was being questioned
about his bigger crimes,

30
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:55,824
he tried to escape the questions
of the officer, acting insane and pitiful.

31
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:14,425
IN THE NAME OF GOD: A HOLY BETRAYAL

32
00:02:24,602 --> 00:02:31,568

2012
MAPLE JOINS THE CHURCH

35
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:48,459
I was born in Canada.

36
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:53,131
That's my mom and dad, and the baby is me.

37
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:57,343
I was born at the end of March,

38
00:02:58,136 --> 00:03:01,890
and apparently, it started snowing
that night all of a sudden.

39
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,229
My parents said that it was fascinating.

40
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:12,066
And so, they really loved me very much.

41
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:31,419
My name is Maple.

42
00:03:31,502 --> 00:03:34,923
I'm from Hong Kong,
and I'm 29 years old in Korean age.

43
00:03:41,679 --> 00:03:42,972
Back then…

44
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:45,058
MAPLE, FORMER MEMBER OF JMS
SEXUAL VIOLENCE VICTIM

45
00:03:45,141 --> 00:03:47,143
…I was in my second year of high school.

46
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:55,818
I went to a mall in Causeway Bay
with my sister and a friend.

47
00:03:58,321 --> 00:04:04,327
HONG KONG

48
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:12,335
They approached us and introduced
themselves as college students.

49
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:16,631
One of them kept on contacting me.

50
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:20,551
She wanted to meet up and talk with me.

51
00:04:29,727 --> 00:04:34,857
Because of different things,
including some trouble I had in school…

52
00:04:37,026 --> 00:04:40,071
I was bullied in school.

53
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:42,240
And also,

54
00:04:43,574 --> 00:04:46,661
my parents weren't getting along.

55
00:04:47,745 --> 00:04:50,373
So I was also having a very hard time.

56
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:55,211
I was depressed.

57
00:04:55,878 --> 00:05:00,758
I didn't know why I had to live on,
or what love meant.

58
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:02,176
And that was just…

59
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:07,098
I was really depressed because of that
and went through a difficult time.

60
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:09,475
I didn't have anyone to talk to.

61
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:17,191
So eventually…

62
00:05:19,193 --> 00:05:22,572
I asked her what the meaning of life is,
and what love means.

63
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:28,161
Then she started talking
to me about the Bible.

64
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:35,585
God created man with a purpose, right?

65
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:41,174
At JMS, they would say
His purpose of creation was love.

66
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:48,639
God loved us very much.

67
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:51,267
Words can't describe how much he loved us.

68
00:05:54,103 --> 00:06:00,818
He loved us a million times more
than a parent loves their child.

69
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:02,945
Do you understand?

70
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:06,199
I was so moved when I heard him say that.

71
00:06:06,282 --> 00:06:09,160
I could not believe
such love existed in this world.

72
00:06:09,243 --> 00:06:13,373
That is how I ended up joining JMS.

73
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:21,381
I used to drink and hang out with guys.

74
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:25,635
And I used to smoke as well.

75
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:34,018
When I confessed
that I used to live my life like that,

76
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:37,647
he told me to serve the Lord
with a pure heart,

77
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:40,149
because He loves me
and because I am His bride.

78
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:43,694
Always keep yourself pure.

79
00:06:46,697 --> 00:06:49,117
You must be clean and chaste.

80
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,745
And likewise,
your spirit must be pure as well.

81
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:54,747
Do you understand?

82
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:58,751
I thought because I had been
forgiven by the Lord,

83
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:05,466
and had become a pure person again…

84
00:07:08,302 --> 00:07:09,262
I thought…

85
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:12,932
that I had become a pure…

86
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:16,769
bride of God.

MAPLE JOINS THE CHURCH

00:07:25,194 --> 00:07:29,115
2008
REPATRIATION OF JEONG MYEONG-SEOK

89
00:07:32,034 --> 00:07:36,164
We heard again
that he'd be sent to Korea soon

90
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:39,083
at the extradition request
of our government.

91
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:50,595
This was a situation
we didn't expect at all.

92
00:07:50,678 --> 00:07:54,474
Because to be handcuffed
and captured like that,

93
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:58,936
and then investigated and questioned,
that wasn't discussed beforehand.

94
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:01,063
PASTOR KIM GYEONG-CHEON
EX-VICE-PRESIDENT OF JMS

95
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:18,498
When Jeong Myeong-seok was brought
to Korea after getting arrested in China,

96
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:21,292
his past indictments,
which were discontinued until then,

97
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:24,504
started to really progress,
and criminal trials were scheduled.

ANSHAN, LIAONING, SEXUAL ASSAULT

105
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:42,730
I tried so hard to resolve
Jeong Myeong-seok's legal issues.

106
00:08:42,813 --> 00:08:46,317
I even took out my housing deposit
to pay the attorneys.

107
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:49,695
I also met up with the victims
to get them to settle.

108
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:56,702
And I hired a law firm
to try and get his charges cleared.

109
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:59,413
They kept following me around,
asking me to settle,

110
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:02,375
even before Jeong Myeong-seok
was arrested and extradited.

111
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:05,920
And after the legal actions began,
I guess they were even more desperate,

112
00:09:06,003 --> 00:09:07,755
so they even came to my home too.

113
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:13,177
They said they would pay me a billion won,
two billion won, or even a blank check,

114
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:15,012
if I settled.

115
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:21,435
Is it true that during the first trial,
an alleged bodyguard of Jeong Myeong-seok

116
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,397
sat in the corner of this courtroom
and tried to intimidate you?

117
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,107
He kept glaring at me.

118
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:29,277
Is it also true that Jeong Myeong-seok

119
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,946
has ordered his bodyguards to frame

120
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:34,282
and threaten to kill you and your sisters?

121
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:35,324
Yes, that is true.

122
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:39,579
They told us that we'll be killed
if we ever get caught.

123
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:45,835
One person ended up dropping out,
but the remaining four never gave in.

124
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:48,754
He was sentenced
to six years in prison at the first trial.

125
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:53,426
VERDICT: SEXUAL ASSAULT, RAPE,
FORCED AND QUASI-FORCED MOLESTATION

126
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:58,014
THE DEFENDANT SHALL BE SENTENCED
TO SIX YEARS IN PRISON

127
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:10,818
While the victim from Hong Kong

128
00:10:10,901 --> 00:10:14,572
was testifying the sexual assault
that happened to her,

129
00:10:15,364 --> 00:10:18,784
this bastard suddenly cried,
"I can't breathe!"

130
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:21,078
while he was making gagging noises.

131
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:23,164
He collapsed while foaming at the mouth.

132
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:26,000
He started convulsing, like this.

133
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:32,214
DECEMBER 4, 2008
IN THE APPEALS COURT

134
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:34,133
They called an ambulance.

135
00:10:34,216 --> 00:10:36,927
The paramedics examined him

136
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,555
and said there was nothing wrong
with him.

137
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:44,644
His blood pressure
should have been high or something,

138
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:46,437
but everything was normal.

139
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:49,398
So the prosecutor said to the attorneys,

140
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:51,859
"Looks like you're putting on a show."

141
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,445
How could he be the Messiah?

142
00:10:54,528 --> 00:10:57,823
He's such a coward, and he's useless.

143
00:10:57,907 --> 00:11:02,244
How could anybody believe anything
that he says and does?

2008, INTERROGATION OF CRIMINAL SUSPECT
JEONG MYEONG-SEOK

145
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:12,254
Q: IS IT TRUE THAT THE THREE WOMEN
WERE NAKED AT THAT TIME?

146
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:15,049
A: THEY WERE NAKED BUT THEY HAD
A TOWEL COVERING THEIR LOWER BODY

147
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:16,467
SO ALMOST NAKED

148
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:18,928
Q: SO IT IS TRUE
THAT YOU WERE WITH THREE NAKED WOMEN

149
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:20,471
WHILE YOU WERE ALSO NAKED

150
00:11:20,554 --> 00:11:22,264
A: THEY SUDDENLY PULLED DOWN MY PANTS

151
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:25,059
SO I WAS NAKED,
THEN I JUST HUGGED EACH OF THEM ONCE

152
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:27,603
Q: DID YOU PENETRATE THEM?
A: I DIDN'T PENETRATE ANYONE

153
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:31,524
I JUST HUGGED THE WOMEN WHILE I WAS NAKED

154
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:34,568
Q: ACCORDING TO 30 OUTLINES,
IS IT TRUE THAT YOU EMPHASIZE CHASTITY

155
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:36,487
AS WELL AS ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIPS AND SEX?

156
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:38,364
A: YES, THOSE ARE STRICTLY BANNED

157
00:11:38,447 --> 00:11:42,076
Q: THEN, WHAT YOU DID WITH YOUR FOLLOWERS
GOES AGAINST THAT DOCTRINE, DOESN'T IT?

158
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:44,995
A: YES, IT DOES

159
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:49,291
Once, the investigative agency conducted
an interrogation of Jeong Myeong-seok.

160
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:54,255
And during the interrogation,
he suddenly got down on his knees

161
00:11:54,338 --> 00:11:56,549
in front of the prosecutor
and started begging,

162
00:11:57,049 --> 00:12:00,594
saying, "I'm so sorry, sir.
Please forgive me once."

163
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:04,974
And as I saw him kneeling and groveling,

164
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,643
I found it really absurd.

165
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:10,104
So did he really beg with his hands?

166
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:12,565
Just like this.

167
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:15,526
He got on his knees
in front of the prosecutor

168
00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:17,445
and begged like this.

169
00:12:22,616 --> 00:12:25,327
So, did you say you can't see God?

170
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:27,204
Well, just look at me. Here's God.

171
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:30,291
You don't need to search for God.
If you can't see God, look at me.

172
00:12:30,374 --> 00:12:31,834
"Are you the Messiah?"

173
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:34,128
He answers,
"I never said I was the Messiah."

174
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:37,882
It was really baffling.
Even his pronunciation was unclear.

175
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:41,886
So, this man who used his authority
as the Messiah to rape all of those women

176
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:44,889
denied ever calling himself the Messiah
when put on the stand

177
00:12:45,389 --> 00:12:48,392
and even said that he wasn't the Messiah.

178
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:50,478
I mean, come on.

179
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:53,814
He called himself the Messiah

180
00:12:55,232 --> 00:12:56,859
and called himself the groom.

181
00:12:57,568 --> 00:13:00,154
That's why we even worked so hard for him.

182
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:03,574
How could he say he's not the Messiah?

183
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:10,623
Jeong Myeong-seok said
he was not the Messiah,

184
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:15,002
and the sisters thought,
"If he's not the Messiah, what are we?"

185
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:17,630
"We gave him our bodies,
hearts, and love."

186
00:13:17,713 --> 00:13:20,132
"We followed him for decades
without getting married."

187
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:23,135
"Now he says he's not the Messiah?"
Someone committed suicide.

188
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:26,472
I heard she jumped off
of her apartment building.

189
00:13:28,432 --> 00:13:31,101
She used to be in the church's
photography department.

190
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:35,064
If Jeong Myeong-seok said right now
that he wasn't the Messiah,

191
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:36,607
there would be many suicides.

192
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:41,529
2008
REPATRIATION OF JEONG MYEONG-SEOK

193
00:13:44,281 --> 00:13:46,951
2009
THE PRESIDENT GOES TO PRISON

194
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:51,664
Supreme Court Part Two confirmed
the ten-year sentence of the initial trial

195
00:13:51,747 --> 00:13:53,958
for Jeong Myeong-seok, the leader of JMS,

196
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:57,378
who had been arrested for sexually
assaulting his female followers.

197
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:02,800
Honestly,

198
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:07,680
I was hoping the judge would sentence him
to 20 or 30 years in prison.

199
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:10,057
I mean, there are so many victims…

200
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:16,856
Back when Jeong Myeong-seok was sentenced
to ten years in prison and incarcerated,

201
00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:20,818
I thought he would either die in prison

202
00:14:20,901 --> 00:14:23,279
or even if he were to get out,

203
00:14:23,904 --> 00:14:26,866
he wouldn't be able to be
a religious leader anymore,

204
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:30,119
and that JMS would dissolve too.

205
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:40,254
As soon as he returned to Korea,
he spent every day of the next ten months

206
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:47,428
transcribing the messages, Proverbs,
and Psalms given by a saint in China.

207
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:52,474
For the sins
of all the people of this era,

208
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:56,687
he was adjudged for the people,
then he laid on the cross.

209
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:02,985
When I was there, I spent my time
spreading joy to the world…

210
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:04,236
JEONG MYEONG-SEOK'S VOICE

211
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,738
…and fighting against evil.

212
00:15:05,821 --> 00:15:07,531
As I was following God's will

213
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:09,408
in bearing the sins of all mankind,

214
00:15:09,491 --> 00:15:11,744
it was completely worthwhile.

215
00:15:11,827 --> 00:15:13,996
I love leading people to salvation.

216
00:15:15,664 --> 00:15:19,960
He thought it was unfair
that he ended up in prison for ten years.

217
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:23,464
He considered his electronic anklets
as a part of carrying the cross.

218
00:15:23,964 --> 00:15:25,758
But I never tried to find out.

219
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:28,719
The followers said
that they were all lies.

220
00:15:28,802 --> 00:15:34,600
They said that the victims
were selling out the Lord.

221
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:37,478
So I trusted what they said.

222
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:39,313
Like an idiot.

223
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:46,320
His inmate number was 1178
at Daejeon Correctional Institution.

224
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:50,991
He said if you pray at one in the morning,
at one in the afternoon,

225
00:15:51,867 --> 00:15:53,452
then at seven in the evening,

226
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:55,871
your life will be eight times better.

227
00:15:56,789 --> 00:16:02,795
The total length of the Korean peninsula
is also apparently 1,178 km.

228
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:09,885
Also, Jeong Myeong-seok's birthday
is March 16, right?

229
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:13,931
He said March 16 is for John 3:16,

230
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:20,270
"For God so loved the world
that He gave His one and only Son."

231
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:24,233
Therefore, Jeong Myeong-seok is Jesus.

232
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:38,580
A girl asked me to go to a hotel
with her to go swimming

233
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:40,624
and told me to bring my bikini.

234
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:45,045
So, I brought my bikini.

235
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:48,966
She said, "Let's take some pictures
to send to the president, and then swim."

236
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:52,886
I was a bit surprised,

237
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:55,597
but all the other girls said it
like it was nothing.

238
00:16:56,932 --> 00:16:59,018
So I just took the pictures in my bikini.

239
00:17:02,646 --> 00:17:05,190
Because it was for the Lord who loved me.

240
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:14,408
PICTURES SENT TO JEONG MYEONG-SEOK
WHILE HE WAS IN PRISON

241
00:17:18,912 --> 00:17:24,501
This is a photo of me.
This is how the "stars" sent pictures.

242
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:26,837
He signed it himself like this.

243
00:17:27,629 --> 00:17:29,423
When Jeong Myeong-seok was in prison,

244
00:17:29,506 --> 00:17:31,967
he enjoyed pictures
of his female followers in bikinis.

245
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,761
When he saw a woman that he liked,

246
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:35,679
he made her visit him at the prison.

247
00:17:41,643 --> 00:17:44,938
FRONT OF DAEJEON CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTION

248
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:46,857
Over there…

249
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:50,986
You go in there,

250
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,822
and that's where you show them
your passport.

251
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:00,913
Back then, we were all so happy.

252
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:04,374
Because we were going to go meet our Lord.

253
00:18:17,554 --> 00:18:19,890
I was emotionally moved, so I cried.

254
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:22,101
I cried so much in there.

255
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:27,606
I was just so thankful I could see him.

256
00:18:27,689 --> 00:18:32,111
It was not something
everybody could do, you know?

257
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:35,697
I thought it was like
a grand opportunity given to me by God.

258
00:18:41,995 --> 00:18:44,581
There was an apartment complex
near the prison.

259
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:48,085
I went there two or three times.

260
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:57,136
From the terrace,
you could see this one spot in the prison.

261
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:03,475
Every day at one in the afternoon,
Jeong Myeong-seok came out to exercise.

262
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:10,983
I would hold a mop in my hands,
and because there was a terrace,

263
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:15,737
I would wave the mop outside like this.

264
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:21,243
Jeong Myeong-seok would see it
and know that we were there.

265
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:26,290
One time, I was there,

266
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:29,168
and he wrote "Maple"

267
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:32,004
on the wall with his hand.

268
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:39,386
When he did that,
I was so moved that I cried.

269
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:54,526
Dear God,

270
00:19:55,652 --> 00:19:57,613
our Lord is there unjustly,

271
00:19:58,822 --> 00:20:00,199
and for all mankind

272
00:20:01,241 --> 00:20:02,701
and for our sins,

273
00:20:04,786 --> 00:20:07,289
he's suffering like that.

274
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,211
I'll spread the Word to more people,

275
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:14,630
so please, Lord,

276
00:20:16,131 --> 00:20:19,801
let him get released soon.

277
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:28,227
2018
THE PRESIDENT'S RELEASE

278
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:45,452
Jeong Myeong-seok, the leader of JMS,
also known as Christian Gospel Mission,

279
00:20:45,535 --> 00:20:47,871
was released after serving
ten years in prison.

280
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:53,418
Jeong will have to wear
an electronic anklet for seven years.

281
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:57,673
It felt like a really harmful vermin

282
00:20:57,756 --> 00:21:00,300
had escaped from the zoo.

283
00:21:01,301 --> 00:21:05,389
It felt like a creature far more dangerous
than a tiger, lion, or bear

284
00:21:06,139 --> 00:21:09,309
had broken out of its cage
and into the world.

285
00:21:22,739 --> 00:21:23,699
SEX OFFENDERS

286
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:26,660
JEONG MYEONG-SEOK

287
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:32,040
SERVED TEN YEARS IN PRISON
PERSONAL INFORMATION MADE PUBLIC

288
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:34,376
AND A NOTICE OF PROXIMITY
TO NEARBY RESIDENTS FOR TEN YEARS

289
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:39,089
JEONG MYEONG-SEOK
JINSAN-MYEON, GEUMSAN-GUN

290
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:42,968
Thank you!

291
00:21:43,051 --> 00:21:44,845
-Thank you!
-Thank you!

292
00:21:45,595 --> 00:21:46,972
I want a better reaction.

293
00:21:47,055 --> 00:21:48,015
Okay!

294
00:21:48,098 --> 00:21:50,142
-Give me a reaction!
-Yes!

295
00:21:50,225 --> 00:21:52,352
If you don't respond, you're a rebel!

296
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:53,520
Amen!

297
00:21:53,603 --> 00:21:56,815
If you're going to do it, do it right!

298
00:21:57,566 --> 00:21:58,942
Or just don't do it at all!

299
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:02,571
Yes!

300
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:04,406
Did you hear the Lord's voice?

301
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:05,949
Yes!

302
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:08,702
Your response makes
a 6,000-year-old history possible.

303
00:22:08,785 --> 00:22:10,537
-Amen!
-Respond!

304
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:12,164
-Yes!
-I'm sorry, sir.

305
00:22:12,247 --> 00:22:14,166
There's no need to fear death!

306
00:22:14,249 --> 00:22:15,083
Yes.

307
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:17,878
Get a grip and keep moving forward!

308
00:22:17,961 --> 00:22:19,921
We will!

309
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:33,602
It is the working of rapture

310
00:22:34,394 --> 00:22:40,025
And the working of love

311
00:22:40,108 --> 00:22:44,363
With God and the Holy Spirit

312
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:50,619
I will do it

313
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:53,372
Without any regrets

314
00:23:01,296 --> 00:23:06,259
You are the very best, my Lord

315
00:23:06,343 --> 00:23:07,761
The best, the best, the best

316
00:23:07,844 --> 00:23:12,766
You are our one and only Lord

317
00:23:12,849 --> 00:23:14,684
You're the only one

318
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:18,271
To give glory to God at official events,

319
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:21,900
we would sing and dance there.

320
00:23:23,276 --> 00:23:26,238
Jeong Myeong-seok
loves to make people sing.

321
00:23:26,321 --> 00:23:28,198
He made me sing too.

322
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:32,160
And people really liked it.

323
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:34,371
So he said, "She's good at singing."

324
00:23:34,454 --> 00:23:36,248
"So I'm appointing her as the singer."

325
00:23:36,331 --> 00:23:38,458
They're the most enthusiastic
cheerleaders.

326
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:40,502
We have two of them right here with us.

327
00:23:45,715 --> 00:23:51,555
Rise and shine your light

328
00:23:52,556 --> 00:23:58,520
It was so exhausting,
so I begged them to stop making me sing.

329
00:23:58,603 --> 00:24:00,939
Then they told me
I should be the news anchor.

330
00:24:01,481 --> 00:24:06,194
I pray that you will all bring peace
on earth and glory to the Lord.

331
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:07,946
Providence News, Jeong Soo-jeong.

332
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:10,615
Jeong Myeong-seok came up with that name.

333
00:24:11,199 --> 00:24:13,160
Jeong Soo-jeong.

334
00:24:15,745 --> 00:24:18,707
I did a lot during those ten years.

335
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:22,335
I did some modeling
and street missionary work.

336
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:26,214
Later, I also served
as a probationer and a pastor.

337
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:32,554
I pray the flames of the Holy Spirit
will be given to us this year.

338
00:24:33,388 --> 00:24:35,807
My Lord!

339
00:24:36,516 --> 00:24:39,019
My Lord!

340
00:24:42,105 --> 00:24:45,692
AMY
FORMER JMS MEMBER

341
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:14,554
When I was a new member,
it was pretty hard to love an old man.

342
00:25:14,638 --> 00:25:18,683
So I used to pray
for three hours every day.

343
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:20,101
I begged God

344
00:25:21,228 --> 00:25:23,605
to please help me love Jeong Myeong-seok.

345
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:36,743
It's cool!

346
00:25:36,826 --> 00:25:39,329
Let's go, we'll be back.
So get on the cart, hurry.

347
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:47,629
MAPLE

348
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:50,840
JEONG MYEONG-SEOK

349
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:54,761
You're the best!

350
00:25:54,844 --> 00:25:57,764
You're the best!

351
00:25:58,265 --> 00:26:01,643
Once, he sent me a letter
while he was still in prison.

352
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:07,065
It said, "When I get out,
you can sit next to me on the golf cart."

353
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:08,692
After he was released,

354
00:26:08,775 --> 00:26:12,737
one day, on a Sunday,

355
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:16,616
he talked about "fulfilling my promises"
in his sermon.

356
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:20,412
He actually let me ride
next to him that day.

357
00:26:20,495 --> 00:26:26,167
So I thought, "Wow, he really is the Lord.
He made that promise so many years ago."

358
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:29,796
"He's finally keeping that promise today."

359
00:26:36,052 --> 00:26:36,886
But,

360
00:26:38,513 --> 00:26:40,056
when I think about it now…

361
00:26:41,558 --> 00:26:43,393
I was such an idiot.

362
00:26:54,696 --> 00:26:58,867
We were near Wolmyeongdong,
but he only summoned me to Cheonggiwa.

363
00:26:59,909 --> 00:27:02,162
CHEONGGIWA: JEONG MYEONG-SEOK'S RESIDENCE
N WOLMYEONGDONG

364
00:27:02,245 --> 00:27:05,790
A girl called me and said,
"Soo-jeong, he says he wants you to come."

365
00:27:06,916 --> 00:27:09,711
Because I was going to the Lord, I felt…

366
00:27:11,588 --> 00:27:12,505
superior, I guess?

367
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:16,426
Nobody else was called there, but I was.

368
00:27:16,509 --> 00:27:20,513
Cheonggiwa was not a place
anybody could just go to.

369
00:27:23,516 --> 00:27:25,935
When I went there, J was there too.

370
00:27:27,228 --> 00:27:31,107
She told me,
"Soo-jeong, I need to go to Seoul today."

371
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:33,943
"You should sleep next to him."

372
00:27:35,028 --> 00:27:37,864
"And tell me if anything happens."

373
00:27:40,533 --> 00:27:41,826
So I said, "Okay."

374
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:45,955
I took a shower and changed
into the pajamas they gave me.

375
00:27:46,539 --> 00:27:50,835
Then I put a blanket on the floor,
and I went to sleep.

376
00:27:52,003 --> 00:27:53,380
I was about to fall asleep,

377
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:55,965
but Jeong Myeong-seok suddenly woke up.

378
00:27:58,468 --> 00:28:01,179
And while he was smiling,

379
00:28:01,262 --> 00:28:04,808
he started touching my buttocks,

380
00:28:04,891 --> 00:28:07,102
and he put his hand into my pants.

381
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:10,146
Then…

382
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:20,990
Jeong Myeong-seok just put
his hand into my vagina.

383
00:28:30,166 --> 00:28:31,292
And then…

384
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:38,216
He said, "God has come.
He has given you His love."

385
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:40,802
"He loves you. He has chosen you."

386
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:46,975
"Don't tell your father
because he would misunderstand."

387
00:28:51,354 --> 00:28:55,859
After that, I got so confused,
so I contacted J.

388
00:28:56,359 --> 00:29:02,365
I told J what had happened
and asked her what it was.

389
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:08,788
She said,
"Don't you know that he adores you?"

390
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:12,459
"It's because you're dear to him."

391
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:18,006
But I told her that it was too hard,
having faith was too hard,

392
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:20,633
and that I wanted to leave.

393
00:29:20,717 --> 00:29:24,846
Then J said, "I left that day on purpose."

394
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:30,935
"I was giving you a chance."

395
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:36,191
You know, a chance to be loved?

396
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:40,487
A chance to get closer to the Lord?

397
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:53,500
He called me to Cheonggiwa again.

398
00:29:57,545 --> 00:29:59,172
He laid his hands on me to pray,

399
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:01,716
then locked the door.

400
00:30:04,677 --> 00:30:06,971
Jeong Myeong-seok looked at me,

401
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:09,933
then said, "You're so pretty."

402
00:30:13,436 --> 00:30:16,272
Then he told me to take off my stockings.

403
00:30:17,941 --> 00:30:22,862
Then he told me to get on the floor
and do the cat pose.

404
00:30:25,615 --> 00:30:26,491
Back then…

405
00:30:28,368 --> 00:30:30,662
I just obeyed him again.

406
00:30:34,415 --> 00:30:35,416
Then…

407
00:30:37,585 --> 00:30:39,295
He suddenly entered me.

408
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:50,181
But it didn't go in smoothly,

409
00:30:51,432 --> 00:30:53,184
so he just kept forcing himself in,

410
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:55,436
and I started bleeding.

411
00:30:56,187 --> 00:30:57,647
It hurt so much.

412
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:01,442
So…

413
00:31:03,403 --> 00:31:05,071
I just wanted him to stop.

414
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:10,493
But after he did that,

415
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:13,830
he said, "You've been raptured now."

416
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:18,126
"You're a beautiful, faith-filled soul."

417
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:27,135
"Never change from now on."

418
00:31:47,655 --> 00:31:49,490
But I endured it all.

419
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,916
He was the Messiah, so I endured it.

420
00:31:59,375 --> 00:32:01,044
In case I might go to Hell. Yeah.

421
00:32:02,545 --> 00:32:05,965
I always thought
it was me who was the problem.

422
00:32:08,217 --> 00:32:13,181
So I tried really… really hard.

423
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:16,476
He's so disgusting.

424
00:32:19,145 --> 00:32:22,732
I hate everything about him,
from his personality to his looks.

425
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:28,863
To love that old man,

426
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:32,283
I prayed desperately to God.

427
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:34,410
And I used to question myself.

428
00:32:35,036 --> 00:32:37,789
"How could you do that
when God loves you so much?"

429
00:32:37,872 --> 00:32:39,958
"How could you?"

430
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:44,837
And I would punish myself.

431
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:50,843
MAPLE'S SELF-HARM

432
00:32:53,179 --> 00:32:54,806
If you abide by the Lord's will,

433
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:57,850
it'd be impossible to go to Hell.

434
00:32:57,934 --> 00:33:00,311
Why? Why would you go to Hell?

435
00:33:00,395 --> 00:33:03,606
If you follow me, why would you?
Do you think I'd go to Hell? No.

436
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:11,197
AMY, FORMER JMS MEMBER
SEXUAL VIOLENCE VICTIM

437
00:35:08,564 --> 00:35:10,942
Those stars couldn't speak Korean,

438
00:35:11,025 --> 00:35:14,654
so I used to go and interpret for them.

439
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:42,640
Like that.

440
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:48,729
I was acting just like the other women.

441
00:35:49,272 --> 00:35:52,441
I acted like there was nothing wrong
just like how they did.

442
00:35:59,782 --> 00:36:01,117
I was brainwashed back then.

443
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:05,204
I did it because it felt like
that was what I needed to do.

444
00:36:05,746 --> 00:36:11,085
But now that I think about it,
I'm so sorry to that person.

445
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:19,677
But it was the norm
to act like that in there.

446
00:36:20,553 --> 00:36:22,513
You'd be a victim
who becomes a perpetrator.

447
00:36:23,055 --> 00:36:26,893
It's a vicious cycle that never stops.

448
00:36:26,976 --> 00:36:30,062
But when you're in there,
you can't recognize that. Yes.

449
00:36:30,146 --> 00:36:31,105
When you come out,

450
00:36:31,814 --> 00:36:35,234
you get confused about whether you
are the victim or the perpetrator.

451
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:42,158
It was so confusing,

452
00:36:42,241 --> 00:36:44,327
but I couldn't talk about it to anyone.

453
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:48,998
It went directly against the doctrine
that I had been taught.

454
00:36:49,081 --> 00:36:54,503
I thought, "Do I need to reach
a higher level to understand it all?"

455
00:37:36,671 --> 00:37:38,839
One of the stars from abroad,

456
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:43,636
who used to live with me,
sent me a text message.

457
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:47,890
She said other stars
had gotten assaulted too,

458
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:51,686
Since I was so close to Jeong Myeong-seok,

459
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:54,230
it was inevitable
that it would also happen to me.

460
00:37:56,065 --> 00:38:01,320
RECORDING OF PHONE CONVERSATION
BETWEEN MAPLE AND A FOREIGN FOLLOWER

461
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:26,387
That's when I made up my mind
and came up with a plan to escape.

462
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:30,975
I told them, "I miss my parents
as I haven't seen them in a year."

463
00:38:31,058 --> 00:38:32,935
"So I'm just going for a short trip."

464
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:35,980
So, on September 14,

465
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:41,485
I was in a situation
where I had to go to say my goodbyes.

466
00:38:50,703 --> 00:38:53,789
I got vaccinated that day,

467
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:57,877
so I had a fever.

468
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:07,219
All night long,

469
00:39:08,304 --> 00:39:12,683
I had a fever
and was feeling really terrible.

470
00:39:17,897 --> 00:39:20,608
But he came into my room again.

471
00:39:24,153 --> 00:39:29,408
He locked the door
so the other women wouldn't come in.

472
00:39:31,243 --> 00:39:34,914
Then he told me he wanted to see
 "that pose," just one last time.

473
00:39:49,929 --> 00:39:52,807
THE FOLLOWING CONTENT WAS RECORDED
BY MAPLE, A SEXUAL VIOLENCE VICTIM

474
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:55,226
ON THE DAY OF THE ASSAULT
AT WOLMYEONGDONG (JMS HQ)

475
00:39:55,309 --> 00:39:57,395
WE REVEAL THIS RECORDING
WITH MAPLE'S CONSENT

476
00:39:58,479 --> 00:39:59,397
Hug me.

477
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,566
Hug me tight.

478
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:06,487
Say that you'll love the Lord forever.

479
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:08,781
I'll love you forever, Lord.

480
00:40:10,032 --> 00:40:13,411
Touch me here again. See if it got bigger.

481
00:40:13,494 --> 00:40:16,247
So amazing. When you do that,
when a man hugs a woman,

482
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:18,916
he gets an erection like crazy.

483
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:21,377
Wow, you have such wide hips.

484
00:40:22,628 --> 00:40:24,588
You have such wide hips, Soo-jeong.

485
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:31,804
You like that?

486
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:36,016
Did you come? Did you?

487
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:39,478
Did you come? Did you squirt?

488
00:40:40,813 --> 00:40:41,772
Are you really wet?

489
00:40:44,358 --> 00:40:46,444
How many times?
How many times did you come?

490
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:49,071
Three times? Twenty times? Four times?

491
00:40:50,406 --> 00:40:52,491
I think I came like 50 times.

492
00:40:53,075 --> 00:40:53,909
Fifty times.

493
00:40:54,952 --> 00:40:56,996
God has chosen you like this.

494
00:40:58,831 --> 00:41:01,292
Make sure that nobody touches this.

495
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:03,961
Because this belongs to God.

496
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:24,398
Thank you.

497
00:41:36,285 --> 00:41:37,703
I mean,

498
00:41:38,704 --> 00:41:40,706
I even had a fever back then.

499
00:41:44,752 --> 00:41:48,380
And what he did was so perverted.

500
00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:53,844
If he actually loved me,
he wouldn't have done that.

501
00:41:53,928 --> 00:41:56,222
It was just so disgusting.

502
00:41:59,099 --> 00:42:01,936
But I was scared
something bad might happen to me.

503
00:42:02,019 --> 00:42:04,313
So I acted like everything was fine.

504
00:42:07,691 --> 00:42:11,695
I kept calling out to God
as I was being victimized.

505
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:28,671
I asked God why I was going through
something like that.

506
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:39,932
Honestly, after that happened to me,

507
00:42:40,599 --> 00:42:43,519
I wanted to kill myself every single day.

508
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:56,865
But I feel like I need to do this.

509
00:42:58,534 --> 00:42:59,910
I want to expose the truth

510
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:06,834
and make sure
there aren't any more victims like me.

511
00:43:43,537 --> 00:43:45,873
2018
THE PRESIDENT'S RELEASE

512
00:43:48,709 --> 00:43:53,130
2022
THE PRESS CONFERENCE ON MARCH 16

513
00:43:54,131 --> 00:43:58,385
SEOUL
MARCH 16, 2022

514
00:43:58,886 --> 00:44:01,847
MAPLE, WHO HAD GONE TO HONG KONG,
RETURNED TO KOREA AFTER FIVE MONTHS

515
00:44:01,930 --> 00:44:03,223
TO ATTEND THE PRESS CONFERENCE

516
00:44:08,854 --> 00:44:10,689
As we announced earlier,

517
00:44:10,773 --> 00:44:14,401
the victim, who agreed
to speak here today,

518
00:44:14,485 --> 00:44:17,946
got severe stomach cramps
because she felt very pressured.

519
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:20,532
So she had to visit the hospital
on her way here,

520
00:44:21,033 --> 00:44:25,371
and she took
a little bit longer to get here.

521
00:44:52,272 --> 00:44:56,360
Maple, should we just go back?
Instead of going to the press conference?

522
00:44:56,443 --> 00:44:57,403
What should we do?

523
00:44:58,904 --> 00:44:59,738
Sorry?

524
00:45:00,739 --> 00:45:01,740
What?

525
00:45:01,824 --> 00:45:02,658
I need to do it…

526
00:45:21,593 --> 00:45:24,763
Even God won't be able to stop me.

527
00:46:11,518 --> 00:46:17,399
YIP MAPLE YING TUNG HUEN
A VICTIM OF JMS

528
00:46:17,483 --> 00:46:22,321
I first visited a JMS church in 1995.

529
00:46:22,404 --> 00:46:24,531
At that time, Maple would have been

530
00:46:24,615 --> 00:46:28,035
a baby in a diaper, who probably
couldn't even walk at that point.

531
00:46:28,827 --> 00:46:29,828
That baby

532
00:46:31,079 --> 00:46:34,208
is sitting there now
as another victim of sexual assault.

533
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:38,629
Just what are we going to do about him?

534
00:46:42,216 --> 00:46:44,760
I cried so much
because I felt so bad for her.

535
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:49,223
I should have been the one to do it.

536
00:46:49,723 --> 00:46:51,725
At such a young age…

537
00:46:52,559 --> 00:46:57,815
When I was the one being assaulted,
if I had stopped him,

538
00:46:57,898 --> 00:47:00,651
then that child
wouldn't have become a victim.

539
00:47:00,734 --> 00:47:01,860
So that was my fault.

540
00:47:01,944 --> 00:47:03,904
SEXUAL VIOLENCE VICTIM KIM JI-EUN (ANONYM)

541
00:47:03,987 --> 00:47:05,656
Because I remained silent,

542
00:47:05,739 --> 00:47:08,075
there were even more victims afterwards.

543
00:47:09,034 --> 00:47:13,497
There's absolutely no way
Jeong Myeong-seok is the Messiah.

544
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:18,752
And JMS is not a place
that is fulfilling God's will.

545
00:47:20,838 --> 00:47:24,216
Jeong Myeong-seok was a cult leader
who was sent to prison for ten years

546
00:47:24,299 --> 00:47:26,760
after sexually assaulting
his female followers.

547
00:47:26,844 --> 00:47:29,930
Jeong Myeong-seok was released
from the prison four years ago.

548
00:47:30,013 --> 00:47:33,684
However, a victim spoke up and exposed him
for continuing to sexually abuse

549
00:47:33,767 --> 00:47:36,019
and assault his followers
after his release.

550
00:47:46,655 --> 00:47:50,242
After I finished the press conference,

551
00:47:50,909 --> 00:47:55,664
I heard that videos
about me and even my family

552
00:47:56,373 --> 00:47:59,918
were posted online.

553
00:48:00,002 --> 00:48:01,670
They were attacking me.

554
00:48:03,672 --> 00:48:06,425
But there's a reason
why their words lack credibility.

555
00:48:06,508 --> 00:48:10,512
If their claims are in fact true,
they should've left the church promptly

556
00:48:10,596 --> 00:48:14,516
and looked for a solution,
which is the natural thing to do.

557
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:16,393
However, that's not what they did.

558
00:48:28,906 --> 00:48:32,993
If you have to stand strong,
like you are right now,

559
00:48:33,076 --> 00:48:36,997
and must sue that person,

560
00:48:37,623 --> 00:48:42,002
I'll stand by your side
and continue to give you my support.

561
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:48,342
People might point fingers at you
behind your back,

562
00:48:48,926 --> 00:48:53,972
but I'm proud of your belief and courage.

563
00:48:55,015 --> 00:48:56,391
I support you, my daughter.

564
00:48:58,268 --> 00:48:59,937
You mean everything to me.

565
00:49:18,497 --> 00:49:19,998
What I want the most now…

566
00:49:22,834 --> 00:49:24,419
is to win the lawsuit

567
00:49:26,213 --> 00:49:30,509
and have people believe me. And I don't…

568
00:49:31,969 --> 00:49:36,807
Even if just one person
steps forward and tells the truth,

569
00:49:40,477 --> 00:49:43,981
then there won't be any more victims.

570
00:49:47,567 --> 00:49:54,533
MAPLE RECENTLY STARTED DRAWING
IN ORDER TO MANAGE HER ANGER

571
00:49:54,616 --> 00:50:00,038
WHICH LED HER TO DISCOVER A NEW TALENT

572
00:50:00,622 --> 00:50:02,582
CHUNGNAM PROVINCIAL POLICE

573
00:50:05,919 --> 00:50:07,629
-Mr. Jeong!
-Mr. Jeong!

574
00:50:08,130 --> 00:50:11,842
Since your release in 2018, have you
sexually assaulted your female followers?

575
00:50:14,094 --> 00:50:16,555
What did you mean
when you said you came 50 times?

576
00:50:17,889 --> 00:50:19,850
Do you really think you're the Messiah?

577
00:50:23,228 --> 00:50:24,604
Please give us a statement!

578
00:50:25,272 --> 00:50:28,900
JEONG MYEONG-SEOK HIRED A LARGE LAW FIRM
TO CONTINUE TO CLAIM INNOCENCE

579
00:50:28,984 --> 00:50:32,362
BUT THE COURT ARRESTED HIM
ON OCTOBER 4, 2022

580
00:50:32,988 --> 00:50:39,911
A FATHER WHO WAS SO GRATEFUL
HE HAD GOTTEN ATTACKED INSTEAD OF HIS SON

581
00:50:44,499 --> 00:50:50,505
PASSED AWAY ON AUGUST 2, 2022
AFTER BATTLING HIS ILLNESS

582
00:50:51,006 --> 00:50:57,512
PROFESSOR KIM DO-HYEONG,
ALSO KNOWN AS "THE BODY OF SATAN"

583
00:50:57,596 --> 00:51:01,183
PUBLISHED A BOOK
ABOUT HIS 30 YEARS OF ANTI-JMS ACTIVITIES

584
00:51:01,266 --> 00:51:04,144
A FORGOTTEN SEASON 1
A PROFESSOR'S BATTLE, BY KIM DO-HYEONG

585
00:51:05,395 --> 00:51:06,772
ALL INTERVIEWS USE REAL TESTIMONIES

586
00:51:06,855 --> 00:51:09,274
TO PROTECT THE SUBJECT'S IDENTITY.
SOME INTERVIEWS HAVE BEEN REENACTED
