00:00:06,256 --> 00:00:08,299
THE FOLLOWING EPISODE CONTAINS

2
00:00:08,383 --> 00:00:11,344
GRAPHIC DEPICTIONS AND FOOTAGE
OF MASS SUICIDE

3
00:00:11,428 --> 00:00:13,930
WHICH MAY BE DISTURBING TO SOME VIEWERS

4
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:24,065
8.29.1987

5
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:26,860
We have all had a very chaotic summer.

6
00:00:26,943 --> 00:00:29,738
However, on this last weekend of August,

7
00:00:29,821 --> 00:00:32,365
a terrible tragedy has shocked us again.

8
00:00:33,825 --> 00:00:38,163
They saw that the ceiling had been
torn open in the factory cafeteria.

9
00:00:38,246 --> 00:00:40,832
When they went up into the ceiling,

10
00:00:40,915 --> 00:00:46,171
they found 32 dead bodies tangled
with one another and called the police…

11
00:00:48,256 --> 00:00:51,051
Can't we finish this quickly?
We can't do our work.

12
00:00:54,596 --> 00:00:55,847
Did he hang himself?

13
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:56,973
My goodness.

14
00:00:57,474 --> 00:01:00,185
-Where did he hang himself from?
-This is a mess.

15
00:01:00,268 --> 00:01:02,270
Can it be aired if you film it in detail?

16
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:08,276
Thirty-two people died in the same place.

17
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:15,450
It was impossible for us
to understand it at all.

18
00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:17,327
Frankly, many questions still remain.

19
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:25,085
FOUR MEN

20
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:28,838
TWENTY-EIGHT WOMEN

21
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:31,508
A TOTAL OF 32 PEOPLE COMMIT MASS SUICIDE

22
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:34,219
There have been suggestions
that they committed suicide

23
00:01:34,302 --> 00:01:36,721
after a death ritual
with their leader, Park Soon-ja.

24
00:01:38,681 --> 00:01:39,891
STRANGLED AFTER BEING DRUGGED

25
00:01:39,974 --> 00:01:43,728
They thought, "Regardless of when we die,
we'd go to heaven as we'd been saved."

26
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:45,814
There was nothing they wouldn't do.

27
00:01:48,733 --> 00:01:50,068
MASS SUICIDE?

28
00:01:50,151 --> 00:01:51,986
No, that's not true at all.

29
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:54,864
It was a mass homicide, not suicide.

30
00:01:55,907 --> 00:01:58,618
MASS HOMICIDE?

31
00:01:58,701 --> 00:02:00,537
People who knew the truth had all died,

32
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:03,581
and key evidence
was either gone or damaged,

33
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:06,292
which limited the progress
of the investigation.

34
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:09,546
I figured there was a third person
involved in this case.

35
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:16,302
This is a blessed land
Where milk and honey flow

36
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:22,767
This is Five Oceans, the land of peace

37
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:25,353
FIVE OCEANS, GOD AND 32 DEAD BODIES

38
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:37,991
IN THE NAME OF GOD: A HOLY BETRAYAL

39
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:46,833
AUGUST 29, 1987
32 DEAD BODIES ON THE CEILING

40
00:02:49,377 --> 00:02:52,338
I became a policeman in 1960,

41
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:56,342
and I started working
at crime scenes in 1964.

42
00:02:58,261 --> 00:03:00,638
I was in the police department
for a long time,

43
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:04,017
but even for me, it was the first time
seeing an unreal case like that.

44
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:09,063
On that day, August 29,

45
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:12,317
it was pouring hard in the afternoon.

46
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:18,198
TRUSTWORTHY POLICE, SAFE COUNTRY

47
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:23,203
AUGUST 29, 1987, 17:00

48
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:26,706
The office phone rang,

49
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:29,000
and they told me
there was a case in Yongin.

50
00:03:32,128 --> 00:03:33,880
They didn't give me the details,

51
00:03:33,963 --> 00:03:38,426
but they said,
"Many people died on the ceiling."

52
00:03:38,509 --> 00:03:41,387
AUGUST 29, 1987, 17:00

53
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:44,891
So I went there in that rain.

54
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:51,064
When I got there,

55
00:03:51,689 --> 00:03:55,109
the ceiling was raised a bit,
and they'd already opened up the ceiling.

56
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:56,527
They told me it was there.

57
00:03:57,779 --> 00:04:00,990
It was dark, so I asked for a flashlight
and used it to look in there.

58
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:02,700
There, I saw the bodies.

59
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:03,993
I was quite shocked.

60
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:05,870
There was a pile of them here…

61
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:07,997
ACTUAL FOOTAGE FROM THE SCENE

62
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:09,874
and another over there.

63
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:14,629
Another person had hanged himself.

64
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:22,303
This was really strange,

65
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:24,389
as their wrists and ankles were tied up,

66
00:04:25,473 --> 00:04:28,309
and their nostrils and mouths
were stuffed.

67
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:31,646
Why on earth did they do that?

68
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:35,108
And there was another one
who was kneeling.

69
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:36,359
It was strange.

70
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:38,444
Why was he like that?

71
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:40,363
And what was the cause of his death?

72
00:04:40,863 --> 00:04:43,741
Did he kill himself, or was he killed?

73
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:48,246
This is group A.

74
00:04:48,746 --> 00:04:53,251
You can see how 19 bodies were stacked
on top of each other in group A, right?

75
00:04:57,005 --> 00:05:00,300
This is group B,
the one that Park Soon-ja was in.

76
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:01,843
There are 12 bodies here.

77
00:05:02,343 --> 00:05:03,511
Park Soon-ja is there.

78
00:05:03,594 --> 00:05:06,055
Park Soon-ja was the cult leader.

79
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:07,307
PARK SOON-JA, 48 YEARS OLD

80
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,891
There was a problem with her too.

81
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:11,811
You can see all those abrasions
on her skin.

82
00:05:11,894 --> 00:05:12,812
Signs of resistance.

83
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:15,356
These look like fingernail marks.

84
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,067
MARK OF RESISTANCE

85
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:33,958
CHART OF THE SCENE INSIDE THE CEILING

86
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:37,003
There were 32 people here.

87
00:05:37,086 --> 00:05:38,838
Except for the one who hanged himself,

88
00:05:38,921 --> 00:05:43,009
there were 31 people, but they did nothing
while the others were dying,

89
00:05:43,092 --> 00:05:45,803
nor did they resist
while they themselves were dying.

90
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:48,639
How bizarre is that?

91
00:05:49,974 --> 00:05:53,394
And they stuffed their mouths with cotton.

92
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:55,313
Just why did they do that?

93
00:05:55,396 --> 00:05:58,900
More than a hundred pieces of cotton
were collected and we thought,

94
00:05:58,983 --> 00:06:01,152
"They must be covered in chemicals."

95
00:06:01,235 --> 00:06:04,280
"Look, there must be toxic chemicals
on them."

96
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:08,159
So we collected them and sent them
to a forensic institute for analysis.

97
00:06:12,997 --> 00:06:16,542
It was on August 30, 1987.

98
00:06:17,126 --> 00:06:18,503
Around 3:00 in the morning,

99
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:21,381
we got a call
from the National Forensic Service.

100
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:25,009
They said, "The Yongin police say
there was a case of unnatural deaths."

101
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:26,677
"Many people died."

102
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:29,639
"It's a major crime case.
You need to come quickly."

103
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:33,059
AUGUST 30, 1987, 05:00
CORONERS STANDING BY AT THE CRIME SCENE

104
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:38,147
When I went in there,

105
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:41,484
the dead bodies
were all lined up on the ground.

106
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:43,694
I went inside and realized,

107
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:46,864
"It's over. All we can do now
is find out the cause of death."

108
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:48,199
Nothing else we could do.

109
00:06:48,282 --> 00:06:50,868
They were already moved.
What else was there to see?

110
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:56,040
AUGUST 30, 1987, 10:00
THE AUTOPSY BEGINS

111
00:06:56,124 --> 00:07:00,294
AUTOPSY ROOM

112
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:03,005
At first, we focused
on the cervical spine area.

113
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:07,552
When we looked at their necks,
we found signs of ligature strangulation.

114
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:10,346
Most of them died by strangulation.

115
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:16,644
Generally, strangulation is not
when somebody hangs themselves,

116
00:07:16,727 --> 00:07:20,064
it is when somebody else
chokes them to death.

117
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,902
And one of them
was the factory manager or something.

118
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:29,991
That man had signs of euisa
around his neck.

119
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:34,036
He hanged himself of his own will to die.
So it was euisa.

120
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,456
EUISA: HANGING ONESELF TO DEATH

121
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:41,127
POLICE ANNOUNCEMENT

122
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:43,463
ALL 32 PEOPLE DIED FROM SUFFOCATION
BY STRANGULATION

123
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:45,423
ONE MALE HANGED HIMSELF

124
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:51,179
31 OTHERS, INCLUDING PARK SOON-JA,
STRANGLED TO DEATH BY SOMEONE ELSE

125
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:56,642
When a woman dies,
we first do a vaginal examination.

126
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:58,102
And we found semen.

127
00:07:58,186 --> 00:08:02,899
We tested them for semen just in case.

128
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:06,944
But we found semen
in 12 samples of vaginal fluid.

129
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:12,742
SPERM

130
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:15,870
SPERM

131
00:08:15,953 --> 00:08:18,331
If a person tests positive for semen,

132
00:08:18,414 --> 00:08:23,586
we presume they had intercourse
at least within the past three days.

133
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:26,380
So, if the bodies
had been up there for four days,

134
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:30,593
that means they had intercourse
with someone while they were up there.

135
00:08:31,385 --> 00:08:34,263
Finding semen in the bodies was crucial

136
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:38,351
because there were two sons and a daughter
among the bodies.

137
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:40,937
FIRST DAUGHTER, SECOND SON

138
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,564
PARK SOON-JA, FIRST SON

139
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:46,192
PARK SOON-JA (AGE 48)
FIRST SON LEE YEONG * (AGE 24)

140
00:08:46,275 --> 00:08:49,445
Does that mean,
in the presence of her sons and daughter,

141
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,781
they had sexual intercourse?

142
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:53,449
That would be impossible.

143
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:57,245
There were only three or four men there.

144
00:08:57,328 --> 00:09:00,122
If those men did that to all those women…

145
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:03,459
Rape, you could say.

146
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,878
But when you think, "Did they rape them?"

147
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:06,963
It seems absurd.

148
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:12,760
At some point, we even thought
that a third party must've been involved.

149
00:09:12,843 --> 00:09:16,389
DETECTIVE TEAM 3

150
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:22,687
The next day, I got a call
and was told nothing was found.

151
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:24,814
No sign of toxic chemicals.

152
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:26,107
I thought, "This is bad."

153
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:27,733
So why did they die?

154
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:35,241
FIVE OCEANS DEATHS WERE STRANGULATION
TOXIC SUBSTANCES WERE NOT DETECTED

155
00:09:35,324 --> 00:09:37,410
MYSTERIOUS MASS DEATH
OF THE FANATICAL CULT

156
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:39,453
Did they really kill themselves?

157
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:40,788
And if they did,

158
00:09:40,871 --> 00:09:42,873
why did they all die with Ms. Park?

159
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:47,878
The mystery of the Five Oceans case
remains unsolved.

160
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:49,880
FULL OF MYSTERIES
FIVE OCEANS MASS SUICIDE CASE

161
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:51,716
AUGUST 29, 1987
32 DEAD BODIES ON THE CEILING

162
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:56,429
AUGUST 16, 1987

163
00:09:56,512 --> 00:09:59,890
(13 DAYS BEFORE FINDING THE BODIES)
CREDITORS ASSAULTED

164
00:10:07,064 --> 00:10:10,693
At the time, in 1987, I was
on Daejeon Ilbo's social affairs team,

165
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:13,738
and I usually reported
on violent crime cases.

166
00:10:14,363 --> 00:10:17,241
FORMER REPORTER AT DAEJON ILBO
IN THE SOCIAL AFFAIRS DEPARTMENT

167
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,952
The last place I went in the early morning

168
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:21,954
was the detention room
at Daejeon Police Station.

169
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:27,710
When I went in, five or six young men
were sitting there, being interrogated.

170
00:10:30,546 --> 00:10:32,882
Those young men looked perfectly normal,

171
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:35,384
but their eyes were a bit weird.

172
00:10:37,261 --> 00:10:39,930
Their eyes looked like
they were all spaced out.

173
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:42,683
At the police station,
they should be making excuses,

174
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:46,854
saying that they were innocent
or repenting for their wrongdoings.

175
00:10:46,937 --> 00:10:49,940
But they showed absolutely no signs
of doing that.

176
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:59,116
After the interrogation was over,
I asked the detective why they were there.

177
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,077
He told me that there's a company

178
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,621
called Five Oceans
in Gasuwon-dong, Daejeon.

179
00:11:03,704 --> 00:11:06,207
And those men
had assaulted some creditors.

180
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:12,338
PARENTS, WHO DEMANDED REPAYMENT,
WERE LOCKED UP AND ASSAULTED

181
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:18,594
The incident started with Lee Sang-bae,
the owner of a gas station

182
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:23,641
who lives in Ippo-ri, Yanghwa-myeon,
Buyeo-gun, Chungcheongnam-do.

183
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:27,853
Lee Sang-bae's daughters ended up
getting involved with Five Oceans.

184
00:11:28,437 --> 00:11:34,235
They got about 500 million won
from their father

185
00:11:34,318 --> 00:11:35,861
and gave the money to Five Oceans.

186
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:39,365
ESCAPING THE NIGHTMARE-LIKE LIFE
OF THE FIVE OCEANS

187
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:40,783
My six siblings and I

188
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:44,161
started working, eating, and sleeping
at Five Oceans

189
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:46,789
without our parents knowing.

190
00:11:51,168 --> 00:11:53,421
We made all sorts of excuses,

191
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:56,632
and the amount of money
my siblings and I took from my parents…

192
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:01,846
was a large sum of 500 million won.

193
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:10,146
So the father, Lee Sang-bae,

194
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:14,150
went to Park Soon-ja
to get his money back.

195
00:12:16,485 --> 00:12:19,488
He asked for his money back,

196
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:23,743
but he ended up signing a bond waiver,

197
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:26,370
and he was also beaten by several people.

198
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:35,087
I WILL FORFEIT THE RIGHT TO RECOLLECT LOAN
FROM FIVE OCEANS TRADING CO., LTD.

199
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:40,468
After that happened,
Lee Sang-bae reported them to the police,

200
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:43,929
and that's how
the Five Oceans incident started.

201
00:12:45,681 --> 00:12:49,018
I wanted to meet
with the CEO of the company.

202
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:52,313
I thought that Park Soon-ja
would have the answers.

203
00:12:52,396 --> 00:12:58,986
PARK SOON-JA
CEO OF FIVE OCEANS

204
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:02,490
The detective's office was underground.

205
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:04,283
When I went inside,

206
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:06,911
a very skinny woman was sitting there.

207
00:13:06,994 --> 00:13:09,455
And that was Park Soon-ja.

208
00:13:14,668 --> 00:13:17,922
She didn't respond
to most questions asked by the police.

209
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:21,300
Her eyes were very piercing.

210
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:24,929
She was just listening to them.

211
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:28,265
Then, suddenly, a cameraman
from a TV station stormed inside.

212
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:31,310
They asked, "Who's Park Soon-ja?"

213
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:34,730
When the detective glanced at her,
they put the camera light in her face.

214
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:37,274
At that moment, she fainted.

215
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:41,737
A young man was sitting there.

216
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:45,074
He was Park Soon-ja's first son.

217
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:49,912
So he hurried and carried
his mother on his back

218
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:52,248
and urgently rushed out.

219
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:57,336
That was the last time
we saw Park Soon-ja.

220
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:02,424
There was an emergency room
in a nearby general hospital,

221
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:04,593
so I think they must have gone there.

222
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:10,474
That's where Park Soon-ja disappeared,
along with her followers.

223
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:15,521
Park Soon-ja, a CEO
who was taken to the emergency room

224
00:14:15,604 --> 00:14:19,108
after she fainted
during a police interrogation on the 24th,

225
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:22,152
disappeared with her son
and the executive director, Lee Yeong-ho,

226
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:24,405
as well as 150 employees and children.

227
00:14:24,488 --> 00:14:27,241
More and more creditors are now appearing.

228
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:32,037
AUGUST 25, 1987
PARK SOON-JA'S ESCAPE

229
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:39,920
JUNE, 1986
FIVE OCEANS TRADING CO., LTD.

230
00:14:45,175 --> 00:14:46,093
SEO YEONG-SUK

231
00:14:46,176 --> 00:14:48,554
REPORTED ON FIVE OCEANS FACTORY
ONE YEAR BEFORE THE INCIDENT

232
00:14:48,637 --> 00:14:50,639
FORMER DIRECTOR
OF NEWS DEPARTMENT AT MBC DAEJEON

233
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:53,475
They were a craft manufacturer

234
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:55,895
when we went to cover
the Five Oceans factory.

235
00:14:57,771 --> 00:15:01,817
They won the presidential award
at a national craftwork competition.

236
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:05,029
I remember they were picked
as an exemplary company in their area

237
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:10,534
and designated
as one of Saemaeul's excellent SMEs.

238
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:15,623
In the city of Daejeon,

239
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:18,792
Park Soon-ja was pretty successful
as a female entrepreneur.

240
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:21,712
Also, as she helped many in need,

241
00:15:21,795 --> 00:15:24,673
she was also an entrepreneur
who did a lot of charity work.

242
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:27,927
I'm someone who's not interested

243
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:29,845
in investments and saving up money.

244
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:32,598
I'm a woman,
but I have no interest in jewelry.

245
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:35,184
"Please allow me to live a selfless life

246
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:38,312
for others and the underprivileged."

247
00:15:39,521 --> 00:15:45,152
Once, I prayed
for those wishes to come true.

248
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:46,862
On the one hand, this company said

249
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:49,949
that they would increase benefits
for the employees.

250
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:53,077
They emphasized that they lived
in a family-like community.

251
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:58,123
We even reported on
and interviewed the children living there.

252
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:10,719
We filmed there a lot
and interviewed quite a few students.

253
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:13,472
They were all living very luxurious lives.

254
00:16:13,555 --> 00:16:16,100
The children who were interviewed
seemed very lively.

255
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:20,270
I think they felt very thankful
toward Park Soon-ja.

256
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:21,981
Your thoughts on Ms. Park?

257
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:23,565
-Our CEO?
-Yes.

258
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:28,570
There's nobody else like her
in this world.

259
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:30,155
What do you mean?

260
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:37,037
I don't know what all other people
might think of her,

261
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:40,874
but I cannot even dare to compare her
to anybody else in any way.

262
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:47,840
This is a blessed land
Where milk and honey flow

263
00:16:47,923 --> 00:16:53,679
This is Five Oceans, the land of peace

264
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:58,225
Do you know what that song is about?

265
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:05,816
GUARANTEED THAT CHILDREN WILL GROW UP
WITHOUT WORRYING ABOUT MONEY

266
00:17:05,899 --> 00:17:09,194
THEY EVEN PROVIDED PREMIUM-QUALITY SOCKS

267
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:11,989
MOST OF HER FOLLOWERS
WERE NOT VERY WELL-OFF

268
00:17:12,072 --> 00:17:17,745
SO THEY WERE GRATEFUL TO MS. PARK
AND BECAME EVEN MORE DEVOTED

269
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:20,122
Park Soon-ja's husband was Lee Gi-jeong,

270
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:24,334
who was the director of construction
in Chungcheongnam-do at the time.

271
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:27,838
Back then, the director of construction
had a lot of power.

272
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:34,887
Within the community, you could say
he was in a leadership position.

273
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:39,933
That's why a lot of people
put their trust in them.

274
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:45,397
When Park Soon-ja
first started gathering private loans,

275
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:50,778
the rate of interest
she borrowed the money for was so high

276
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:53,864
that it would be unimaginable today.

277
00:17:54,865 --> 00:17:56,075
It was 40%.

278
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:59,119
If you let her borrow a million won,

279
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,039
you'd get 40,000 won as interest.

280
00:18:02,831 --> 00:18:07,503
I gave her the money
that I had made in Saudi Arabia.

281
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:09,922
So I could live a better life.

282
00:18:10,005 --> 00:18:14,384
We thought a high-ranking official's wife
would never scam us.

283
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:16,512
We didn't think she'd steal our money.

284
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:19,890
So we never tried to receive any interest,

285
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:23,143
but we continued
to reinvest more and more money.

286
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:29,149
AUGUST 26, 1987

287
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:35,114
10 BILLION WON DISAPPEARS
THREE DAYS BEFORE THE INCIDENT

288
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:39,326
To locate Ms. Park's private loans
of eight billion won,

289
00:18:39,409 --> 00:18:42,246
the police obtained a warrant
for the search and seizure

290
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:46,500
and have started an investigation
into eight financial institutions.

291
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:49,461
Ms. Park thoroughly brainwashed
her employees

292
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:54,299
by saying that borrowing more money
was the only way to obey the Holy Spirit.

293
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:57,803
Her brainwashed employees
stopped at nothing to borrow money

294
00:18:57,886 --> 00:19:00,139
from their families and acquaintances,

295
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:01,890
which they gave to Ms. Park.

296
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:04,143
Why did you lend her your money?

297
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:07,938
There were some certificates
at Five Oceans.

298
00:19:08,021 --> 00:19:11,108
I saw that as well as the facilities
of the company,

299
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:12,484
so I lent them money.

300
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:15,028
She never said that she'd pay us interest.

301
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:17,197
She said,
"I'm going to help those in need."

302
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:21,577
"I'm going to help you
instead of thinking of you as a creditor."

303
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:24,037
"So trust me and give me the money."

304
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:27,499
Do you know many people
who were affected by her around you?

305
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:30,335
As far as I know,

306
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:37,342
I went to see the creditors yesterday,
and there were around 220 victims.

307
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:38,719
FIND THE HIDDEN MONEY

308
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:42,431
When I estimated
the total amount of debt at the time,

309
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:44,057
it was over ten billion won.

310
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:47,978
It'd be worth
hundreds of billions of won now.

311
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:49,730
It was a lot of money.

312
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:52,816
At the time,

313
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:56,403
most private loans had an interest rate
of 20% or 30%.

314
00:19:56,486 --> 00:20:00,199
But Five Oceans succeeded
because they paid the interest in advance.

315
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:02,034
PROMISSORY NOTE

316
00:20:02,117 --> 00:20:05,662
The interest was paid in advance,
and the money was sent to the bank account

317
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:06,997
on the exact date.

318
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,666
FIVE OCEANS TRADING CO., LTD.
PARK SOON-JA, CEO

319
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:12,836
Due to the increase in creditors,
the police changed the investigation

320
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:15,839
from a potential simple assault
to a large-scale fraud case.

321
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:19,009
They are trying to locate Ms. Park,
the company's CEO, who has fled.

322
00:20:19,092 --> 00:20:21,428
EVERY EMPLOYEE MOBILIZED
TO USE HIGH INTEREST RATES AS BAIT

323
00:20:21,511 --> 00:20:24,014
A SYSTEM BASED ON PERFORMANCE
ONE MEMBER EVEN RECRUITED 106 PEOPLE

324
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:26,350
PARK SOON-JA

325
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:31,563
As she was borrowing money
to pay back the interest,

326
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:33,232
it probably wasn't sustainable.

327
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:37,736
I think she ran away
because she couldn't handle the situation.

328
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:41,073
LAST WHEREABOUTS OF PARK SOON-JA

329
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:44,743
FAINTED DURING POLICE INTERROGATION
ON AUGUST 24, 1987

330
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:48,497
RAN AWAY FROM DAEJEON ST. MARY'S HOSPITAL

331
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:52,751
DISAPPEARED WITH HER FOLLOWERS
ON AUGUST 25, 1987

332
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:56,255
I saw them
when they were leaving the factory.

333
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:59,174
I wondered, "Why are they leaving?
Did something happen?"

334
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:01,260
They were all in such a hurry.

335
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:06,473
And they were all very happy.
They were even giving praise.

336
00:21:06,556 --> 00:21:11,895
They were saying, "Hallelujah."
They were having a great time.

337
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:16,358
We were wondering where Park Soon-ja
and her followers had gone.

338
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:19,695
We looked everywhere,
but we couldn't find any trace of her.

339
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:21,655
AUGUST 26, 1987

340
00:21:21,738 --> 00:21:23,865
10 BILLION WON DISAPPEARS
THREE DAYS BEFORE THE INCIDENT

341
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:30,747
1985
MY FAMILY WAS BRAINWASHED BY FIVE OCEANS

342
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:41,717
JO CHEONG-JA
CREDITOR OF FIVE OCEANS

343
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,011
Back then, I worked at the post office.

344
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:47,055
Another female employee
who worked at the post office told me

345
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:49,474
that she had a friend at Five Oceans.

346
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:51,685
Then she told me about Five Oceans.

347
00:21:51,768 --> 00:21:54,896
She said they took in kids
in difficult situations and raised them,

348
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,857
and they did really admirable work.

349
00:21:57,357 --> 00:22:01,194
She said we should check the place out,
and so we went.

350
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:04,573
MANUFACTURER OF CRAFTWORK
FIVE OCEANS TRADING CO., LTD.

351
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:10,162
She said, "If you lend us money,
then you'll be helping us too."

352
00:22:10,245 --> 00:22:14,666
"You'd be helping Ms. Park
do good things."

353
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,668
"She always pays interest on time."

354
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:21,256
She said all those things,
which is why I think I gave her my money.

355
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:27,387
Well, the interest was always on time.

356
00:22:27,471 --> 00:22:30,682
I think the interest rate was 20%.
That was a lot back then.

357
00:22:32,142 --> 00:22:36,521
That's why I kept borrowing money
from different places to give them.

358
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:42,569
PROMISSORY NOTE

359
00:22:43,278 --> 00:22:49,117
I invested about 85 million won,
and so did my father.

360
00:22:49,659 --> 00:22:55,040
My father gave them about 90 million won,
but he didn't get any of it back.

361
00:22:56,375 --> 00:23:00,379
Back then, my husband
was taking a break from work.

362
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:05,384
Park Soon-ja said things like,
"A man should take care of his family."

363
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:07,177
She said she would give him a job.

364
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:12,015
I was introduced to Park Soon-ja,

365
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:15,352
then I began working at Five Oceans.

366
00:23:16,603 --> 00:23:18,563
I thought she was a really good person.

367
00:23:19,981 --> 00:23:21,983
I thought that she was special.

368
00:23:25,278 --> 00:23:28,323
The place was pretty lively
when I visited to look around,

369
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:30,867
but that changed a bit
once I started working there.

370
00:23:31,993 --> 00:23:34,329
Inside, things were not quite the same.

371
00:23:42,337 --> 00:23:45,298
Everybody was acting weirdly subdued.

372
00:23:45,382 --> 00:23:50,011
And only a few people were working
inside the factory as well.

373
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:54,933
There were not many
finished craft products either.

374
00:23:55,016 --> 00:24:00,981
Five Oceans wasn't a company
that manufactured products and sold them.

375
00:24:01,064 --> 00:24:04,192
They bought finished products,
placed them around,

376
00:24:05,026 --> 00:24:07,571
and made it look like they had made them.

377
00:24:08,071 --> 00:24:15,036
THE MOTHER OF ORPHANS?

378
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,497
That was fake too. They weren't orphans.

379
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:22,669
You know the creditors?
The people who gave her their money.

380
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:25,630
They were the creditors' kids.

381
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:30,302
They said, "It must be so hard
to raise kids and work at the same time."

382
00:24:30,385 --> 00:24:33,513
They said that they would do it for me.

383
00:24:34,014 --> 00:24:36,391
"We'll take care of your kids
if you bring them."

384
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:37,851
That's what they would say.

385
00:24:39,603 --> 00:24:44,774
They ran a daycare center
and raised the kids there.

386
00:24:44,858 --> 00:24:48,403
They didn't let kids
call their father "Dad."

387
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:51,364
Apparently, they made the kid
call him "Chief" instead of "Dad."

388
00:24:51,448 --> 00:24:54,034
The parents didn't treat
their kids like their own.

389
00:24:54,117 --> 00:24:56,286
That's how they lived in there.

390
00:24:59,623 --> 00:25:03,585
Once, I saw something
on the television, and…

391
00:25:03,668 --> 00:25:07,255
She was dressing the kids
in hanbok and saekdongot like that.

392
00:25:08,048 --> 00:25:10,800
On television,
they were supposedly all orphans.

393
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:15,680
A PICTURE OF HIS SON
AS A PROMOTIONAL MODEL FOR FIVE OCEANS

394
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:20,685
I started putting two and two together
because it was all so ridiculous.

395
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:22,979
I realized, "Oh, this isn't right."

396
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:25,982
FIVE OCEANS TRADING CO., LTD.

397
00:25:26,066 --> 00:25:32,239
They provided food and shelter,
and they all lived in there.

398
00:25:32,322 --> 00:25:35,116
But they weren't allowed to talk freely.

399
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,411
Even family members couldn't talk
with each other in there.

400
00:25:38,495 --> 00:25:41,248
I heard that married couples
couldn't live together.

401
00:25:41,331 --> 00:25:43,166
I heard they all lived separately.

402
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:45,085
They had so many secrets there.

403
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:48,421
UNDER THE ORDER OF CEO PARK'S ORDER

404
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:50,674
THE SEVEN OF US HAD TO HIDE THE FACT
THAT WE'RE SIBLINGS

405
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:55,345
THERE WERE TEN MARRIED COUPLES
IN THE DORMS, BUT THEY LIVED SEPARATELY

406
00:25:56,721 --> 00:25:59,099
We needed permission
to go run personal errands.

407
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,893
They asked us why we were leaving.

408
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:05,313
They were supervising us
so we wouldn't leave the place.

409
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:08,525
Also, I think they set a time to "repent."

410
00:26:08,608 --> 00:26:11,611
So they'd all gathered together
by themselves.

411
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:19,703
And beat each other.

412
00:26:19,786 --> 00:26:21,037
"You need to repent."

413
00:26:21,121 --> 00:26:23,123
They told them to reflect on their sins.

414
00:26:24,374 --> 00:26:26,793
They said, "God is beating you, not me."

415
00:26:28,044 --> 00:26:32,299
THEY MADE EVERYONE ATTEND
THE SESSION OF REPENTANCE ONCE A MONTH

416
00:26:32,382 --> 00:26:34,593
AND CONFESS IN FRONT OF OTHERS

417
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:38,763
THEY BEAT EACH OTHER UP AS A GROUP
TO "GET RID OF THEIR EVIL FEELINGS"

418
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:40,640
Was Park Soon-ja God?

419
00:26:40,724 --> 00:26:42,017
She was God.

420
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,768
-She was God in there?
-Of course.

421
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:47,397
She said, "You'll all die
if you don't follow me."

422
00:26:48,356 --> 00:26:49,691
That's how she was.

423
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:54,154
According to what the survivors
of the Five Oceans incident said,

424
00:26:54,237 --> 00:26:55,947
Park Soon-ja always emphasized

425
00:26:56,031 --> 00:27:00,785
that she was someone who had received
a certain revelation from God.

426
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:04,497
She said
she had received God's revelation,

427
00:27:04,581 --> 00:27:06,541
and that the world would end soon.

428
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:12,756
MS. PARK SAID SHE'D BEEN HEALED

429
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:15,634
FROM DIAPHRAGM CANCER
IN 1978 WITH THE HELP OF THE HEAVENS

430
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:17,886
AS THE CONQUEROR OF FIVE OCEANS

431
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:20,221
SHE SAID SHE WOULD RULE THE WORLD

432
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:23,475
AND SHE MADE OTHERS THINK
THAT SHE IS A GOD-LIKE BEING

433
00:27:30,023 --> 00:27:32,067
AUGUST 25, 1987
PARK SOON-JA'S ESCAPE

434
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:36,946
AUGUST 28, 1987

435
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:40,033
FIVE OCEANS' YONGIN FACTORY
THE DAY BEFORE THE BODIES WERE FOUND

436
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:43,328
The police dispatched
detectives everywhere

437
00:27:43,411 --> 00:27:45,330
to find Ms. Park and her employees,

438
00:27:45,413 --> 00:27:47,248
but they were nowhere to be found.

439
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:50,627
However, 49 children
from the nursery school were found

440
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:52,837
in Yongin, Gyeonggi-do
yesterday afternoon.

441
00:27:54,589 --> 00:27:58,343
The police found 49 children hiding
on a farm in Yongin, Gyeonggi-do.

442
00:27:58,426 --> 00:28:00,470
The children were either sent back home

443
00:28:00,553 --> 00:28:02,889
or accommodated in a facility
for the investigation,

444
00:28:02,972 --> 00:28:05,517
but they stayed silent,
slowing things down.

445
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,688
We got an anonymous call.

446
00:28:10,605 --> 00:28:16,861
"Park Soon-ja's followers are on a farm
in Samin-dong, Yongin, Gyeonggi-do."

447
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:19,322
SAMIN-DONG, YONGIN, GYEONGGI-DO

448
00:28:19,406 --> 00:28:23,118
When we looked,
there was a factory under the mountains

449
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:25,620
that had been built on terraced land.

450
00:28:36,256 --> 00:28:39,300
The factory was dead silent.

451
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:40,635
Nobody was in there.

452
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:58,278
So we went up to the very top
where we found a van.

453
00:28:59,028 --> 00:29:03,032
There was nobody in the van too,
and the doors were closed.

454
00:29:03,116 --> 00:29:06,953
But I found a small ticket
when I looked at the driver's side.

455
00:29:07,036 --> 00:29:09,622
It said, "Daejeon, Yongin."

456
00:29:09,706 --> 00:29:12,375
So I realized,
"This van must have come from Daejeon."

457
00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:14,586
"This car belongs to Five Oceans."

458
00:29:14,669 --> 00:29:15,879
DAEJEON TO YONGIN

459
00:29:22,302 --> 00:29:23,428
Well, I went in there.

460
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:27,849
It was completely silent.

461
00:29:38,735 --> 00:29:41,863
There were 32 people
hiding on the ceiling.

462
00:29:44,657 --> 00:29:46,534
So I went and stood under there, and…

463
00:29:47,535 --> 00:29:49,412
I realized that somebody was there.

464
00:29:49,496 --> 00:29:55,460
But I didn't think
that 32 people would be hiding up there.

465
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:04,010
Then suddenly, the very next day,
they were discovered as dead bodies.

466
00:30:15,772 --> 00:30:18,399
A woman in her 40s,
who had incurred a huge debt,

467
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:20,693
while running a nursery
and craftwork factory,

468
00:30:20,777 --> 00:30:24,656
killed 31 people as well as herself.

469
00:30:25,532 --> 00:30:29,786
The police concluded that Park,
the indebted CEO of Five Oceans,

470
00:30:29,869 --> 00:30:33,164
and her blind followers
had committed mass suicide,

471
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:34,833
driven by religious fanaticism.

472
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:37,293
She called this place heaven on earth.

473
00:30:39,128 --> 00:30:42,465
Yeah. She said that we'd be revived
and go to heaven.

474
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:53,393
Stop crying.

475
00:30:59,649 --> 00:31:02,151
I didn't think
that they would die like that.

476
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:05,947
I even thought
that Park Soon-ja was still alive.

477
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:07,365
It was baffling.

478
00:31:08,157 --> 00:31:12,412
No matter how much you've sinned,
death is still the ultimate punishment.

479
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:26,009
Kim Yeong-hui, who has worked
in the kitchen of the factory

480
00:31:26,092 --> 00:31:28,261
where the incident took place,
is here with us.

481
00:31:28,344 --> 00:31:31,931
We heard that Ms. Park
brought people here from Daejeon in a van.

482
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:34,517
Could you tell us what she did after that?

483
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,061
After the van arrived,

484
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:40,607
everybody spent a day with us
on the ground floor.

485
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:43,192
The day after that,
they went up to the attic.

486
00:31:43,276 --> 00:31:44,986
AUGUST 26, 1987

487
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:51,200
PARK SOON-JA AND HER FOLLOWERS
HEAD UP INTO THE CEILING

488
00:31:54,829 --> 00:31:57,999
I found that they climbed up this way,
so I decided

489
00:31:58,082 --> 00:31:59,751
to use the powder for fingerprints.

490
00:31:59,834 --> 00:32:02,754
We put the powder all over the walls.

491
00:32:02,837 --> 00:32:04,923
Once we put the powder on there,

492
00:32:05,006 --> 00:32:08,509
we saw fingerprints,
handprints, palm lines,

493
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:10,637
footprints, and foot lines.

494
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:13,556
They were all over the wall,
smeared by hands and feet.

495
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,642
They climbed up and down the walls.

496
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:25,735
How did you supply them with food?

497
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:31,115
I made rice balls
and sent them up in plastic bags.

498
00:32:32,825 --> 00:32:35,036
Once a day,
I put the rice balls in plastic bags

499
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:37,497
and handed them up to the ceiling.

500
00:32:39,415 --> 00:32:41,918
Around what time
did you give them the food?

501
00:32:42,001 --> 00:32:43,127
At eight in the morning.

502
00:32:44,337 --> 00:32:47,131
So you gave them food once every day
at eight in the morning?

503
00:32:47,215 --> 00:32:48,049
Yes.

504
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:51,886
The rice balls
couldn't have been enough food.

505
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:54,305
I'm guessing
they didn't get to eat enough.

506
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:55,223
Right.

507
00:32:56,015 --> 00:32:59,310
They got one meal a day,
but they didn't even get to eat that.

508
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:02,355
Around ten rice balls
were rotting up there.

509
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:05,066
So they barely ate anything.

510
00:33:05,608 --> 00:33:08,194
In that heated place
for five days and four nights.

511
00:33:08,861 --> 00:33:11,906
I mean, anybody
would have gotten exhausted.

512
00:33:13,616 --> 00:33:15,743
What did those people do during the day?

513
00:33:16,577 --> 00:33:17,829
They just stayed still.

514
00:33:18,579 --> 00:33:19,956
-Without saying a word?
-No.

515
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:23,584
-In the ceiling?
-Yes.

516
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:25,753
-So they just stayed in the ceiling?
-Yes.

517
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:29,966
And what did those people do in there?

518
00:33:30,049 --> 00:33:32,343
I don't know what they were doing.

519
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:34,429
I wasn't allowed to go up or see them.

520
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,642
AUGUST 30, 1987
THE DAY AFTER THE BODIES WERE FOUND

521
00:33:39,726 --> 00:33:42,061
THE PROSECUTION'S ANNOUNCEMENT
ON THE INVESTIGATION

522
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:46,190
Park Soon-ja, Five Oceans's CEO,
decided to kill herself

523
00:33:46,941 --> 00:33:48,776
when she was faced

524
00:33:50,653 --> 00:33:54,907
with a difficult situation
due to a large amount of debt.

525
00:33:55,742 --> 00:34:02,457
And the others who died in this incident
had always relied on her spiritually.

526
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:07,253
Therefore, they decided
to all die together with her.

527
00:34:07,336 --> 00:34:11,007
We are assuming
that this incident is a mass suicide

528
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:13,968
that resulted from religious fanaticism.

529
00:34:16,095 --> 00:34:20,433
The cause of death for Lee Gyeong-su
was euisa.

530
00:34:21,434 --> 00:34:23,728
For the 31 others, including Park Soon-ja,

531
00:34:23,811 --> 00:34:26,522
the cause of death was strangulation.

532
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:29,734
As for the process of their deaths,

533
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:33,654
it is assumed that Park Soon-ja
ordered Lee Gyeong-su,

534
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:37,283
her male employee,
to murder everybody else, which he did.

535
00:34:37,366 --> 00:34:44,248
After that, Lee Gyeong-su
committed suicide by hanging himself.

536
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:51,672
It appears that Park Soon-ja
was the first to die among them.

537
00:34:53,216 --> 00:34:55,051
FINDINGS FROM THE INVESTIGATION
IN 1987

538
00:34:55,134 --> 00:34:57,595
FOLLOWING CEO PARK SOON-JA'S ORDERS

539
00:34:58,387 --> 00:35:02,016
FACTORY MANAGER LEE GYEONG-SU
FIRST STRANGLED CEO PARK SOON-JA TO DEATH

540
00:35:02,725 --> 00:35:04,727
HE THEN STRANGLED THE 30 OTHERS

541
00:35:05,394 --> 00:35:08,064
LASTLY, HE HANGED HIMSELF TO DEATH

542
00:35:10,733 --> 00:35:12,944
DO NOT ENTER
INVESTIGATION IN PROGRESS

543
00:35:13,027 --> 00:35:15,071
Do you agree
with the investigation results?

544
00:35:15,655 --> 00:35:17,031
No, I do not agree with it.

545
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:20,326
I feel like some parts of them
were quite a stretch.

546
00:35:20,409 --> 00:35:25,373
I think additional investigations
were necessary.

547
00:35:25,456 --> 00:35:28,167
They didn't conduct
the primary investigation properly.

548
00:35:30,044 --> 00:35:34,674
Back then, the government just wanted
to get things done quickly and over with.

549
00:35:34,757 --> 00:35:38,094
They did nothing to find evidence
or confirm it was a murder case,

550
00:35:38,177 --> 00:35:41,430
as they didn't want to complicate
this Five Oceans case.

551
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:46,060
1987, THE PROSECUTION'S ANNOUNCEMENT
ON THE INVESTIGATION

552
00:35:47,603 --> 00:35:49,397
1988
THE SPECIAL INVESTIGATION COMMITTEE

553
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:52,733
FOR CORRUPTION IN THE FIFTH REPUBLIC
REINVESTIGATES THE FIVE OCEANS CASE

554
00:35:53,317 --> 00:35:56,654
Kim Hyeon, the chairman
of the Special Investigation Committee,

555
00:35:56,737 --> 00:36:00,867
claimed that the Five Oceans incident
was most likely a mass murder.

556
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:04,287
He said he'll be listening to reports
to find out the truth.

557
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:06,873
He reported it to the police in Daejeon…

558
00:36:06,956 --> 00:36:09,917
As a member
of the National Assembly from Daejeon,

559
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:13,754
I had been hearing a lot
about the Five Oceans case.

560
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:16,215
There were so many questions
about the case,

561
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:20,094
but they just concluded it to be a suicide
even though nothing was resolved.

562
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:23,723
Therefore, I thought the National Assembly
should reinvestigate the case.

563
00:36:23,806 --> 00:36:27,894
He claimed it was a mass homicide
committed by a third party.

564
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:30,771
It was a homicide.

565
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:34,233
A homicide disguised as a suicide.

566
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:41,240
They said, "Lee Gyeong-su killed them,
then he hanged himself last."

567
00:36:42,325 --> 00:36:48,289
From a forensic or medical perspective,
though, that makes no sense.

568
00:36:50,124 --> 00:36:56,047
SUSPICION NUMBER 1
THE CIRCULAR MARK

569
00:36:57,465 --> 00:36:58,382
He hanged himself.

570
00:36:59,175 --> 00:37:00,426
Did he hang himself?

571
00:37:00,509 --> 00:37:01,510
My goodness.

572
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:05,181
-Where did he hang himself from?
-This is a mess.

573
00:37:07,266 --> 00:37:10,436
Lee Gyeong-su was the manager
of the factory located

574
00:37:10,519 --> 00:37:14,565
in Namsa-myeon, Yongin,
where the mass murder occurred.

575
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:23,574
Here, his blood vessels were pressed
while he was still alive, so…

576
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:25,701
Basically, it's a bloodstain.

577
00:37:25,785 --> 00:37:28,287
This is called a ligature mark.
It's from the rope.

578
00:37:30,039 --> 00:37:32,416
It circles his neck from the front.

579
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,335
It went all the way around.

580
00:37:36,212 --> 00:37:38,339
The mark continues
to the back of his neck.

581
00:37:39,382 --> 00:37:41,884
It goes around
the back of his neck completely, right?

582
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:43,886
In forensics textbooks,

583
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:47,306
a mark encircling the entire neck means

584
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:48,891
that the victim was strangled.

585
00:37:52,478 --> 00:37:55,147
If you just look
at how he's hanging there,

586
00:37:55,815 --> 00:37:57,441
if you look at the first picture,

587
00:37:57,525 --> 00:37:59,944
you can see
it's not touching his hind neck at all.

588
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:03,114
By the law of physics,
the noose should be floating

589
00:38:03,197 --> 00:38:04,907
as much as the body weighs.

590
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:16,919
EUISA: HANGING ONESELF TO DEATH

591
00:38:21,674 --> 00:38:27,054
STRANGULATION: CHOKED TO DEATH
BY ANOTHER PERSON WITH A ROPE

592
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:34,145
STRANGULATION: LEAVES A CIRCULAR MARK

593
00:38:34,228 --> 00:38:39,400
EUISA: DOES NOT LEAVE A CIRCULAR MARK

594
00:38:41,485 --> 00:38:44,822
None of the women there
were hanged to death.

595
00:38:44,905 --> 00:38:47,033
They were all strangled from behind.

596
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:54,457
What that means is, somebody placed
the rope around the neck and tied it hard

597
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:56,334
so that it tightens the back as well.

598
00:38:56,417 --> 00:38:58,044
That's how they were killed.

599
00:38:58,836 --> 00:39:01,172
They were all murdered.

600
00:39:04,633 --> 00:39:09,430
SAME CIRCULAR MARKS FOUND ON THE 31 PEOPLE
WHO WERE STRANGLED TO DEATH

601
00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:16,479
THE SAME MARK WAS FOUND ON LEE GYEONG-SU,
WHO SUPPOSEDLY KILLED HIMSELF

602
00:39:19,565 --> 00:39:23,778
Basically, the rope was tied

603
00:39:24,945 --> 00:39:27,323
very tightly around the neck.
Extremely tightly.

604
00:39:27,406 --> 00:39:32,453
But when a 60-kilogram male
is hanging on the rope by his neck,

605
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:36,040
the soft skin will get squeezed
with the rope cutting into it.

606
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:38,376
If the rope goes in like that,

607
00:39:38,459 --> 00:39:40,961
then there will be a small space there.

608
00:39:41,879 --> 00:39:44,048
1. HE CHOKES HIS OWN NECK STRONGLY
WITH AN OVERHAND KNOT

609
00:39:44,131 --> 00:39:45,383
SO, A CIRCULAR MARK APPEARS

610
00:39:45,466 --> 00:39:49,553
2. AS TIME PASSES, THE ROPE CUTS
INTO THE FRONT OF HIS NECK

611
00:39:49,637 --> 00:39:52,098
SPACE FORMS AT THE BACK OF HIS NECK

612
00:39:59,188 --> 00:40:04,819
SUICIDE?

613
00:40:08,322 --> 00:40:09,240
SUSPICION NUMBER 2

614
00:40:09,323 --> 00:40:14,245
FACTORY MANAGER LEE GYEONG-SU
KILLED 31 PEOPLE ALL BY HIMSELF?

615
00:40:14,328 --> 00:40:17,665
It would have taken Lee Gyeong-su
more than two months

616
00:40:17,748 --> 00:40:20,000
to kill all 31 people by himself.

617
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:22,253
There's no way
he could have done it by himself.

618
00:40:22,336 --> 00:40:26,298
On top of that,
if Lee Gyeong-su really killed 31 people,

619
00:40:26,382 --> 00:40:29,468
there should have been signs
of hypodermal bleeding on his hands.

620
00:40:30,052 --> 00:40:32,263
But there was nothing like that.

621
00:40:43,566 --> 00:40:44,817
It shouldn't be the case,

622
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:48,821
but we can't say the investigation
was completely accurate.

623
00:40:48,904 --> 00:40:53,868
There's just no way
that Lee Gyeong-su could have killed

624
00:40:53,951 --> 00:40:57,121
all those people by himself.

625
00:40:57,204 --> 00:41:01,876
It would be difficult to conclude
that the people there killed each other,

626
00:41:02,793 --> 00:41:06,797
but it'd be easy for some outsiders
to come in and kill them all.

627
00:41:07,756 --> 00:41:11,385
If we conclude
that Lee Gyeong-su was murdered

628
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:14,680
along with everybody else,

629
00:41:14,763 --> 00:41:21,145
at least in my opinion,
in order to do something like that,

630
00:41:21,228 --> 00:41:26,442
it would take more than six people
at least eight or ten hours.

631
00:41:26,525 --> 00:41:28,736
Even that wouldn't be enough time.

632
00:41:29,361 --> 00:41:35,284
SUSPICION NUMBER 3
CULT LEADER PARK SOON-JA BEATEN TO DEATH?

633
00:41:37,369 --> 00:41:41,457
PARK SOON-JA, CEO OF FIVE OCEANS

634
00:41:46,629 --> 00:41:50,674
At first, we focused
on Park Soon-ja's cervical spine area.

635
00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:55,429
When we looked at her neck,
we found signs of ligature strangulation.

636
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:59,683
We thought that the marks
had come from being strangled to death.

637
00:42:03,229 --> 00:42:06,065
Many abrasions were found on her skin
where the rope was tied.

638
00:42:06,148 --> 00:42:09,151
So, when somebody
was pulling on that rope,

639
00:42:09,235 --> 00:42:11,862
she was resisting
and trying to get the rope off.

640
00:42:11,946 --> 00:42:14,657
That's why there were
many signs of resistance.

641
00:42:17,868 --> 00:42:21,413
We performed autopsy on her head
at the very end,

642
00:42:21,497 --> 00:42:24,250
and we found a hemorrhage under her scalp.

643
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:26,627
The hemorrhage probably means

644
00:42:27,127 --> 00:42:30,381
that she was assaulted

645
00:42:30,464 --> 00:42:32,591
before she was finally killed.

646
00:42:33,175 --> 00:42:34,051
SKULL

647
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:39,098
Generally, there wouldn't be a hemorrhage
like that under the scalp

648
00:42:39,181 --> 00:42:41,767
unless you suffered
a very strong blow to the head.

649
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:43,143
Look. It's quite large.

650
00:42:43,894 --> 00:42:46,605
These only appear
if you get hit by a hammer or a club,

651
00:42:46,689 --> 00:42:49,191
or if you get slammed into a wall.

652
00:42:50,025 --> 00:42:55,948
SCALP HEMORRHAGE

653
00:43:00,703 --> 00:43:04,373
But Park Soon-ja was the leader.
Her children were there with her.

654
00:43:04,957 --> 00:43:07,501
Would they be able
to choke her from behind

655
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:09,878
while she was resisting
to get the rope off?

656
00:43:09,962 --> 00:43:11,922
I'm saying that doesn't make any sense.

657
00:43:13,507 --> 00:43:15,926
Do you think Park Soon-ja
wanted to die or not?

658
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:18,512
She didn't.
That's why she had signs of resistance.

659
00:43:19,138 --> 00:43:24,768
I think they concluded
Park Soon-ja died earlier than the others.

660
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:29,106
But it doesn't make any sense
that the leader died first.

661
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:31,567
We are estimating

662
00:43:33,152 --> 00:43:35,362
that the deaths of the 32 people

663
00:43:36,488 --> 00:43:41,952
took place over ten hours.

664
00:43:42,036 --> 00:43:48,208
Among them, it appears
that Park Soon-ja died first,

665
00:43:49,084 --> 00:43:53,672
and Lee Gyeong-su died last
by hanging himself.

666
00:43:54,548 --> 00:43:58,761
If you look at the other cases
that occurred in similar cults,

667
00:43:58,844 --> 00:44:03,098
unless the leader dies first
from an accident,

668
00:44:03,182 --> 00:44:06,352
the leader usually kills themselves

669
00:44:06,435 --> 00:44:11,190
after watching everybody else die
or kill themselves.

670
00:44:11,774 --> 00:44:14,318
But among the 32 people who died,

671
00:44:14,401 --> 00:44:20,282
Park Soon-ja died a lot earlier
than the 31 others.

672
00:44:20,366 --> 00:44:24,286
Considering that Five Oceans
wasn't just a business

673
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:29,124
but a religious group,

674
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:33,587
it seems very unlikely
that she was physically assaulted

675
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:38,217
and killed while she was resisting.

676
00:44:39,426 --> 00:44:41,887
Also, they all kept calling her
"the cult leader,"

677
00:44:41,970 --> 00:44:45,933
but they only called her
"the leader of Five Oceans Church"

678
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:48,143
to cover up the case as soon as possible.

679
00:44:48,227 --> 00:44:51,563
But Five Oceans Church never even existed.

680
00:44:52,815 --> 00:44:58,779
THE MYSTERY INSIDE THE CEILING
THE THIRD HYPOTHESIS

681
00:44:58,862 --> 00:45:02,199
"Was the location
where the bodies were found suitable

682
00:45:02,282 --> 00:45:05,786
for 32 people to commit suicide?"

683
00:45:05,869 --> 00:45:08,038
That's the biggest question, really.

684
00:45:08,122 --> 00:45:10,499
That's why people suspected a third party.

685
00:45:10,582 --> 00:45:13,168
Some even hypothesized
they were killed outside

686
00:45:13,252 --> 00:45:15,879
and then brought up into the ceiling.

687
00:45:26,306 --> 00:45:27,141
Push it inward.

688
00:45:36,692 --> 00:45:41,238
The police are saying that
they were all killed up there, one by one.

689
00:45:41,321 --> 00:45:45,451
Well, I think there's absolutely no way
they were killed up there.

690
00:45:46,744 --> 00:45:50,080
A single step would make them fall,
so they put down plywood there.

691
00:45:52,458 --> 00:45:56,295
So, they stacked all the bodies
on top of that thick plywood.

692
00:45:58,088 --> 00:46:01,800
If you stepped beyond the plywood,
you'd fall through the ceiling for sure.

693
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:08,974
Did somebody really kill those people
while there were 10 or 13 bodies

694
00:46:09,057 --> 00:46:12,478
piled up on the plywood next to them?

695
00:46:12,561 --> 00:46:13,687
It doesn't make sense.

696
00:46:14,646 --> 00:46:17,024
They only fit up there
because they were in a pile.

697
00:46:17,107 --> 00:46:18,817
The place was just too small.

698
00:46:18,901 --> 00:46:21,570
Killing 14 people in there, one by one?

699
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:24,031
That's impossible.

700
00:46:25,199 --> 00:46:27,493
Moreover, according to the people

701
00:46:27,576 --> 00:46:30,704
who the detectives met with
during the investigation,

702
00:46:30,788 --> 00:46:32,456
on the day of the incident,

703
00:46:32,539 --> 00:46:37,836
during the time frame
those people are assumed to have died,

704
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:40,422
the van had come in and out

705
00:46:40,506 --> 00:46:43,133
of the Yongin factory

706
00:46:43,217 --> 00:46:47,846
about two times.

707
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:50,265
Considering those testimonies,

708
00:46:50,349 --> 00:46:54,770
wouldn't it be possible for somebody
to have killed those people elsewhere,

709
00:46:54,853 --> 00:46:58,440
and then move the bodies to the factory?

710
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:02,361
LEE SAM-JAE, FORMER SENIOR SUPERINTENDENT

711
00:47:02,444 --> 00:47:05,072
SCENES-OF-CRIME OFFICER
IN THE FIVE OCEANS CASE

712
00:47:07,282 --> 00:47:10,035
If you look at the scene of the case,

713
00:47:10,118 --> 00:47:14,081
it doesn't look like somebody
killed those people then ran away.

714
00:47:15,123 --> 00:47:16,500
You can't see it like that.

715
00:47:20,254 --> 00:47:22,422
This is the urine container.

716
00:47:22,506 --> 00:47:26,385
Here's a blanket, a water bottle,
and some cups to drink the water with.

717
00:47:27,302 --> 00:47:30,055
-Was there a lot of urine?
-More than half of it was filled.

718
00:47:35,102 --> 00:47:37,729
They were there from August 25th to 29th,

719
00:47:37,813 --> 00:47:41,525
so they stayed there
for three nights and four days.

720
00:47:41,608 --> 00:47:47,698
During those three nights and four days,
they must have had to eat and defecate.

721
00:47:48,907 --> 00:47:51,785
Here are some half-eaten rice cakes
and glasses.

722
00:47:53,036 --> 00:47:57,332
This is half-eaten baby food.
But they didn't even get to eat much.

723
00:47:58,542 --> 00:48:02,129
Those are three boxes of ramyeon,
but they were unopened.

724
00:48:04,214 --> 00:48:07,217
They had five more boxes of ramyeon
on both sides.

725
00:48:08,594 --> 00:48:10,512
So, they must have gone up there

726
00:48:10,596 --> 00:48:13,599
thinking that they'd be eating
and staying there for a while.

727
00:48:13,682 --> 00:48:17,477
But they got exhausted after a day,
and they couldn't eat.

728
00:48:17,561 --> 00:48:19,605
But they couldn't even run, you know?

729
00:48:23,066 --> 00:48:26,194
Here, they're bringing the bodies down
one by one.

730
00:48:26,278 --> 00:48:28,864
Three or four people
are receiving from the bottom, right?

731
00:48:28,947 --> 00:48:31,241
Two or three people
are helping from the ceiling.

732
00:48:31,325 --> 00:48:34,995
Despite that, it wasn't easy
to lower the bodies down.

733
00:48:35,078 --> 00:48:37,205
So it wouldn't be possible
to bring them up.

734
00:48:37,289 --> 00:48:40,334
If somebody had been moving
dead bodies up there,

735
00:48:40,417 --> 00:48:42,336
they would have done it like that.

736
00:48:42,419 --> 00:48:45,255
Their clothes would be in a mess,
torn up and everything.

737
00:48:45,339 --> 00:48:47,799
But all of their clothes looked tidy.

738
00:48:47,883 --> 00:48:51,303
Their wrists and ankles
weren't tied up that tightly.

739
00:48:53,597 --> 00:48:56,975
They were tied up very sloppily,
using ripped-up blankets.

740
00:48:58,060 --> 00:49:00,270
I think they were tied
as they were being lifted.

741
00:49:00,771 --> 00:49:04,274
Maybe someone tied them when lifting,
as the bodies were all drooping.

742
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:09,988
But they definitely didn't tie them up
to kill them, like you see in the movies.

743
00:49:11,490 --> 00:49:13,909
Lifting people up
and putting them in a pile is easy,

744
00:49:13,992 --> 00:49:16,328
but killing them is very difficult.

745
00:49:20,666 --> 00:49:23,543
The people who said that
probably never even saw the scene

746
00:49:24,044 --> 00:49:26,254
and were just using their imagination.

747
00:49:26,338 --> 00:49:32,135
You can never lift a dead body that way,
let alone a living person.

748
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:36,598
And they think somebody
lifted dead bodies? All 32 of them?

749
00:49:36,682 --> 00:49:37,516
No way.

750
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:40,936
That's coming from somebody
who never even saw the scene.

751
00:49:41,019 --> 00:49:42,354
Don't even listen to them.

752
00:49:46,024 --> 00:49:48,860
When I went up into the ceiling
and looked around,

753
00:49:48,944 --> 00:49:54,992
I found small pieces of torn-up paper
here and there,

754
00:49:55,075 --> 00:49:56,243
with writing on them.

755
00:49:56,326 --> 00:49:59,204
My instinct told me,
"Oh, this is it. This is unusual."

756
00:49:59,287 --> 00:50:01,832
Because I look for unusual things.
So I crawled around.

757
00:50:01,915 --> 00:50:03,375
I found them everywhere,

758
00:50:03,875 --> 00:50:06,169
and the pieces
formed half a sheet of A4 paper.

759
00:50:06,253 --> 00:50:09,047
I got all the pieces
and brought them to my office.

760
00:50:09,131 --> 00:50:10,590
After I brought them in,

761
00:50:10,674 --> 00:50:14,803
the female employees put them together
in less than two hours and gave it to me.

762
00:50:15,595 --> 00:50:17,180
It was interesting.

763
00:50:17,973 --> 00:50:19,975
There was writing on the front and back.

764
00:50:24,479 --> 00:50:25,981
Here's the important part.

765
00:50:27,107 --> 00:50:29,484
"Keep your mouth shut."

766
00:50:30,277 --> 00:50:32,362
"She's already unconscious."

767
00:50:33,155 --> 00:50:36,742
"Five people have died
since four hours ago."

768
00:50:37,451 --> 00:50:39,369
"Stay quiet."

769
00:50:39,453 --> 00:50:41,288
"It was planned from the beginning."

770
00:50:41,997 --> 00:50:44,374
"Endure it with the guidance
of the Holy Spirit."

771
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:47,294
"I think everybody will die
by the end of today."

772
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:52,090
It seemed like they had been
in the process of murdering people.

773
00:50:58,096 --> 00:51:03,435
I kept hearing sounds of somebody
being beaten up there before.

774
00:51:04,019 --> 00:51:06,813
I heard sounds
of something being hit, like this.

775
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:10,859
When I heard them crying,

776
00:51:10,942 --> 00:51:13,820
I just assumed
that they were all repenting.

777
00:51:23,246 --> 00:51:30,128
DISAPPEARANCE OF THE 10 BILLION WON:
THE CAUSE OF DEATH

778
00:51:32,631 --> 00:51:34,466
Thirty-two people died at the time.

779
00:51:34,549 --> 00:51:37,677
They were alike
as they were important members

780
00:51:37,761 --> 00:51:40,263
who collected a lot of money…

781
00:51:40,347 --> 00:51:41,598
LIST OF AGENTS

782
00:51:41,681 --> 00:51:45,393
…from themselves, their relatives,
and acquaintances as well.

783
00:51:45,477 --> 00:51:49,523
Those 32 people were basically those
who collected money for her.

784
00:51:49,606 --> 00:51:50,732
They ran her errands.

785
00:51:50,816 --> 00:51:56,196
Five Oceans' Park Soon-ja's total debt
has been calculated to be 11 billion won.

786
00:51:56,279 --> 00:51:58,865
At Five Oceans this afternoon,
300 creditors gathered.

787
00:51:58,949 --> 00:52:02,369
During their sit-in,
they demanded that the police find

788
00:52:02,452 --> 00:52:05,372
Park Soon-ja's accomplice
and her hidden money.

789
00:52:05,872 --> 00:52:08,625
The most important aspect of this case

790
00:52:08,708 --> 00:52:13,338
was that somebody had earned money,
while somebody else lost their money.

791
00:52:14,339 --> 00:52:17,259
But nobody knew
where that money had gone.

792
00:52:17,342 --> 00:52:20,804
The police and the public
were very interested

793
00:52:21,638 --> 00:52:25,851
in investigating the person
behind the mobilization of the funds.

794
00:52:26,643 --> 00:52:30,188
Today, the police investigating
the mass deaths at the Five Oceans factory

795
00:52:30,272 --> 00:52:32,399
confirmed that Park's husband,
Lee Gi-jeong,

796
00:52:32,482 --> 00:52:37,028
was present at the scene from 1:00
to 8:00 a.m. on the day of the case,

797
00:52:37,112 --> 00:52:39,865
which was August 29.

798
00:52:39,948 --> 00:52:43,285
They are currently investigating
whether Lee Gi-jeong was involved.

799
00:52:44,578 --> 00:52:48,165
He was the director of construction
in Chungcheongnam-do.

800
00:52:50,917 --> 00:52:56,590
Excluding himself,
his entire family died in Namsa-myeon.

801
00:52:58,592 --> 00:53:02,596
His wife, two sons, and one daughter.
His entire family was gone.

802
00:53:03,805 --> 00:53:06,683
You were the first
to discover the scene, right?

803
00:53:06,766 --> 00:53:08,226
Please tell us what happened.

804
00:53:11,563 --> 00:53:14,024
My goodness.
I don't know what to tell you.

805
00:53:15,942 --> 00:53:22,449
What can a person say when he has killed
all his children and his wife?

806
00:53:26,077 --> 00:53:29,915
A lot of things about Lee Gi-jeong
are still unknown.

807
00:53:30,665 --> 00:53:33,501
NEVER THOUGHT THEY WOULD COMMIT SUICIDE

808
00:53:33,585 --> 00:53:35,879
HE KNOWS NOTHING
ABOUT THE DEBT OF 7.6 BILLION WON

809
00:53:35,962 --> 00:53:38,089
He said, "I wasn't involved in this case."

810
00:53:39,507 --> 00:53:43,553
He also said,
"I'm also a victim who lost his children."

811
00:53:43,637 --> 00:53:45,555
That's what he said in his testimony.

812
00:53:46,306 --> 00:53:51,519
Did you know that your wife
was running a business?

813
00:53:54,856 --> 00:53:55,982
I wasn't really aware.

814
00:53:59,444 --> 00:54:00,737
Right. Your wife…

815
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:06,117
There's no way Lee Gi-jeong
didn't know about it.

816
00:54:08,703 --> 00:54:10,705
It must have been really complicated

817
00:54:10,789 --> 00:54:13,416
to receive all that money
and pay the interest.

818
00:54:14,125 --> 00:54:17,545
On top of that,
all three of his children were…

819
00:54:17,629 --> 00:54:20,840
They all had those titles,
like "vice-chief."

820
00:54:20,924 --> 00:54:24,344
How could their father not know about it?
It's impossible.

821
00:54:25,428 --> 00:54:30,350
I think Lee Gi-jeong probably
visited the factory periodically.

822
00:54:30,433 --> 00:54:32,018
You know, to get the products.

823
00:54:32,102 --> 00:54:36,314
I don't know where he took them,
but I've seen him take them a few times.

824
00:54:36,398 --> 00:54:39,067
He probably knew
that they had borrowed a lot of money.

825
00:54:39,150 --> 00:54:40,443
That's because,

826
00:54:41,736 --> 00:54:44,531
as far as I know,
a part of those private loans

827
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:49,452
had something to do
with the society of the wives

828
00:54:49,536 --> 00:54:51,329
of Chungcheongnam-do's civil officials.

829
00:54:51,413 --> 00:54:53,540
Did her husband really not know anything?

830
00:54:53,623 --> 00:55:00,338
FIND ROH SUN-HO
WHO HAS THE ANSWER TO THE SECRET

831
00:55:00,422 --> 00:55:03,300
To arrest Roh Sun-ho,
the 31-year-old Five Oceans manager,

832
00:55:03,383 --> 00:55:07,304
who may have the crucial information
to solve this case,

833
00:55:07,387 --> 00:55:11,141
police investigators were sent
to Imsil-gun, Jeollanam-do, his hometown.

834
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:16,438
Roh Sun-ho was responsible
for writing a ledger

835
00:55:16,521 --> 00:55:19,566
to keep track of the borrowed money
and where it was going.

836
00:55:19,649 --> 00:55:21,109
It wasn't just me.

837
00:55:21,192 --> 00:55:27,449
Many other people thought Roh Sun-ho
would partially be the key to this case.

838
00:55:38,585 --> 00:55:42,547
FIVE OCEANS GENERAL MANAGER
ROH SUN-HO'S MOTHER

839
00:55:43,548 --> 00:55:45,675
Sun-ho, you need to come clean.

840
00:55:45,759 --> 00:55:48,178
So the truth will be out,
and you can live your life.

841
00:55:48,261 --> 00:55:50,472
If you don't do that, you'll be blamed.

842
00:55:50,555 --> 00:55:53,600
They will say you killed them
and ran away.

843
00:55:53,683 --> 00:55:55,477
If you're innocent and clean,

844
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:59,314
but you're just scared,
stay at a friend's place for a few days.

845
00:55:59,397 --> 00:56:01,941
Then you can just come clean.
Just turn yourself in.

846
00:56:02,025 --> 00:56:03,485
And it will be fine.

847
00:56:03,568 --> 00:56:07,614
It's not too late to come forward, okay?
You really need to do it.

848
00:56:08,823 --> 00:56:12,160
We thought that the longer
Roh Sun-ho remained missing,

849
00:56:12,243 --> 00:56:18,291
the slimmer the chances were
of him still being alive.

850
00:56:18,375 --> 00:56:20,377
AUGUST 29TH, 1987
32 DEAD BODIES ON THE CEILING

851
00:56:23,963 --> 00:56:28,343
JULY 11TH, 1991
ROH SUN-HO'S MURDERERS TURN THEMSELVES IN

852
00:56:28,426 --> 00:56:31,137
SIX KEY FIGURES IN THE FIVE OCEANS CASE
TURN THEMSELVES IN

853
00:56:31,221 --> 00:56:33,515
Six people suddenly turned themselves in.

854
00:56:33,598 --> 00:56:35,350
They said they had buried Roh Sun-ho.

855
00:56:35,433 --> 00:56:37,977
It's very unusual for murderers

856
00:56:38,478 --> 00:56:42,774
to turn themselves in
a year and a half after the murder.

857
00:56:44,526 --> 00:56:48,947
Three people,
who were believed to be missing,

858
00:56:49,030 --> 00:56:54,160
including 32-year-old Roh Sun-ho,
Five Oceans' general manager,

859
00:56:54,244 --> 00:56:58,289
were found to be assaulted and killed
by the employees and believers,

860
00:56:58,373 --> 00:57:00,625
then buried secretly.

861
00:57:01,251 --> 00:57:04,421
They were Five Oceans employees,
so Park Soon-ja's men.

862
00:57:07,465 --> 00:57:09,926
I'd like to apologize
to the victims' families.

863
00:57:10,885 --> 00:57:12,637
I'm a victim too, though.

864
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:17,392
Anyway, I'd like to sincerely apologize
to the families about the dead victims.

865
00:57:25,733 --> 00:57:29,612
ROH YI-HO, OLDEST SISTER
OF FIVE OCEANS GENERAL MANAGER ROH SUN-HO

866
00:57:36,244 --> 00:57:38,288
He had his whole life ahead of him.

867
00:57:38,371 --> 00:57:41,040
He never got the chance to live up to his…

868
00:57:50,925 --> 00:57:54,053
My God. They put him in a burlap sack
when they buried him.

869
00:57:54,137 --> 00:57:55,054
In a burlap sack.

870
00:57:55,138 --> 00:58:00,393
They tied him up in there
and buried him, you know?

871
00:58:00,477 --> 00:58:02,437
I can't believe that he died like that.

872
00:58:07,692 --> 00:58:10,904
If he betrayed them and left,
no matter how much they covered up,

873
00:58:11,613 --> 00:58:13,573
the truth would be exposed.

874
00:58:13,656 --> 00:58:16,367
That's why they killed him.
So that he'd never leave.

875
00:58:17,869 --> 00:58:22,624
The prosecution revealed that Roh Sun-ho,
the general manager, was assaulted 

876
00:58:22,707 --> 00:58:26,461
and buried secretly by people,
when he showed signs to leave the group

877
00:58:26,544 --> 00:58:30,006
as its debt reached 10.8 billion won
since being founded.

878
00:58:31,466 --> 00:58:35,053
Why did those people turn themselves in?

879
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:38,348
They had been practicing
turning themselves in

880
00:58:38,431 --> 00:58:40,892
for over a year
in an organized and meticulous fashion.

881
00:58:41,518 --> 00:58:45,980
They brought in police officers,
who taught them how to turn themselves in.

882
00:58:46,064 --> 00:58:48,191
"Say that there are no connections…

883
00:58:48,816 --> 00:58:51,569
…between Five Oceans
and the Salvation Sect."

884
00:58:51,653 --> 00:58:55,657
That's what they trained them to say
by a police officer.

885
00:58:55,740 --> 00:58:59,327
It has been revealed
that the group was forced to confess

886
00:58:59,410 --> 00:59:01,120
that Park made them do everything,

887
00:59:01,204 --> 00:59:04,874
and that the Five Oceans case
had nothing to do with the Salvation Sect.

888
00:59:04,958 --> 00:59:08,378
MOST OF THE FIVE OCEANS CULPRITS
WERE FOLLOWERS OF THE SALVATION SECT

889
00:59:08,461 --> 00:59:10,380
The six of them said they had killed,

890
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:12,340
and that they followed Salvation Sect.

891
00:59:12,423 --> 00:59:15,969
What reason did they have
to kill those people from Five Oceans?

892
00:59:16,052 --> 00:59:19,430
The Salvation Sect said
that those six men who confessed

893
00:59:19,514 --> 00:59:21,266
were not their followers,

894
00:59:21,349 --> 00:59:26,312
but previous members
who had already left the Salvation Sect.

895
00:59:26,854 --> 00:59:33,736
WHO WAS BEHIND THE INCIDENT?

896
00:59:36,239 --> 00:59:39,075
In the videos
that were filmed at the scene,

897
00:59:39,158 --> 00:59:43,496
there was a note that said,
"Samwoo is suffering now too."

898
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:46,291
It was submitted
to the prosecutorial investigation team

899
00:59:46,374 --> 00:59:48,501
as reference material as well.

900
00:59:48,585 --> 00:59:50,753
It was used as evidence.

901
00:59:50,837 --> 00:59:56,509
One of the clues that they found back then
was Samwoo Trading Company.

902
00:59:57,260 --> 01:00:03,600
SAMWOO IS NOW SUFFERING A LOT TOO

903
01:00:05,727 --> 01:00:09,480
When I went
into the Five Oceans factory in Gasuwon…

904
01:00:09,564 --> 01:00:10,481
FIVE OCEANS TRADING CO.

905
01:00:10,565 --> 01:00:12,442
…Samwoo Trading was all over the place.

906
01:00:12,817 --> 01:00:17,405
SAMWOO TRADING CO., LTD.

907
01:00:18,031 --> 01:00:19,866
Who owned Samwoo Trading Company?

908
01:00:20,366 --> 01:00:22,368
Yoo Byeong-un is the one who founded it.

909
01:00:22,994 --> 01:00:26,289
Yoo Byeong-un, Semo's CEO, was thought

910
01:00:26,372 --> 01:00:29,751
to be the de facto leader
of the Salvation Sect.

911
01:00:37,842 --> 01:00:41,054
YOO BYEONG-UN
CEO OF SAMWOO TRADING CO., LTD. THEN

912
01:00:41,137 --> 01:00:44,932
LEADER OF THE EVANGELICAL BAPTIST CHURCH
OF KOREA (SALVATION SECT)

913
01:00:46,934 --> 01:00:49,479
Though the church members
refer to Mr. Yoo as "president,"

914
01:00:49,562 --> 01:00:51,314
some of the members

915
01:00:51,397 --> 01:00:56,235
worship Mr. Yoo as "the living Jesus,"
"Messiah," or "the Holy Spirit."

916
01:01:02,367 --> 01:01:03,701
JEONG DONG-SEOP, FORMER PROFESSOR

917
01:01:03,785 --> 01:01:06,663
FORMER INTERPRETER OF YOO BYEONG-UN,
KOREA BAPTIST THEOLOGICAL UNIVERSITY

918
01:01:06,746 --> 01:01:09,040
Because he was a leader,

919
01:01:09,582 --> 01:01:13,252
he needed a solid foundation,
so he started a business.

920
01:01:13,753 --> 01:01:15,004
He needed money.

921
01:01:15,088 --> 01:01:20,301
Making money by receiving offerings
from the members had its limits.

922
01:01:20,385 --> 01:01:22,011
So, what happened was

923
01:01:22,637 --> 01:01:27,225
he took over Samwoo Trading Company,
which was on the verge of bankruptcy.

924
01:01:27,850 --> 01:01:31,437
Then he appointed some people to collect

925
01:01:32,146 --> 01:01:35,316
and accumulate money for him

926
01:01:35,900 --> 01:01:40,279
in major cities like Gwangju,
Daegu, Busan, and Daejeon.

927
01:01:43,199 --> 01:01:50,039
Park Soon-ja was in charge
of collecting private loans in Daejeon.

928
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:54,585
So, she was just one
of Yoo Byeong-un's minions

929
01:01:54,669 --> 01:01:57,964
who was being used by him.

930
01:01:58,047 --> 01:02:02,260
SAMWOO TRADING CO. (CURRENTLY "SEMO")
YOO BYEONG-UN

931
01:02:02,343 --> 01:02:07,348
FIVE OCEANS, PARK SOON-JA

932
01:02:10,309 --> 01:02:14,188
Yoo Byeong-un's notes or his book
of sermons, From Alpha to Omega,

933
01:02:14,272 --> 01:02:17,525
were discovered at the scene of the case,
and judging by them,

934
01:02:17,608 --> 01:02:20,236
it would be reasonable to assume

935
01:02:20,319 --> 01:02:24,282
that Five Oceans was a company
pretending to be a religious group,

936
01:02:24,365 --> 01:02:26,659
which was actually collecting
private loans.

937
01:02:26,743 --> 01:02:30,455
FIVE OCEANS TRADING CO., LTD.

938
01:02:36,085 --> 01:02:39,714
She didn't transfer the money
directly to Yoo Byeong-un.

939
01:02:40,381 --> 01:02:42,550
There was another person
named Song Jae-hwa.

940
01:02:42,633 --> 01:02:45,303
You can say that she was his assistant.

941
01:02:45,386 --> 01:02:48,431
Basically, she was his fund assistant
who was the closest to him.

942
01:02:49,682 --> 01:02:51,350
YOO BYEONG-UN

943
01:02:51,434 --> 01:02:53,478
SONG JAE-HWA

944
01:02:53,561 --> 01:02:59,776
Song Jae-hwa was the link
between Samwoo Trading and Five Oceans.

945
01:02:59,859 --> 01:03:04,071
She seemed like the one
who collected funds for Yoo Byeong-un.

946
01:03:04,655 --> 01:03:09,035
If we get to know Mr. Yoo
just mentally and intellectually,

947
01:03:09,118 --> 01:03:13,372
and realize that
he is definitely the wise one,

948
01:03:14,165 --> 01:03:16,834
no one would oppose his work

949
01:03:16,918 --> 01:03:21,214
and start to blindly follow
and obey whatever he does.

950
01:03:21,297 --> 01:03:22,507
That's what I said.

951
01:03:23,549 --> 01:03:27,887
Of course, Yoo Byeong-un
didn't take responsibility and go to jail.

952
01:03:28,387 --> 01:03:33,100
He blamed everything on Song Jae-hwa.

953
01:03:33,684 --> 01:03:34,560
Stop it!

954
01:03:34,644 --> 01:03:36,312
-What are you doing?
-Damn it, hey.

955
01:03:36,395 --> 01:03:37,522
Damn it.

956
01:03:38,397 --> 01:03:40,149
What are you doing now?

957
01:03:40,733 --> 01:03:43,361
Hey, do it later! I have to go!

958
01:03:43,444 --> 01:03:44,278
-Why?
-Don't do it!

959
01:03:44,362 --> 01:03:46,489
I said I'm not going to talk to the press!

960
01:03:46,572 --> 01:03:50,243
Ms. Song may be the crucial link
that will explain

961
01:03:50,326 --> 01:03:53,830
the complicated relationship
between Five Oceans' CEO Park Soon-ja,

962
01:03:53,913 --> 01:03:56,624
Semo's CEO Yoo Byeong-un,
and the Salvation Sect.

963
01:03:57,291 --> 01:03:59,585
You really didn't collect private loans
in Gwangju?

964
01:03:59,669 --> 01:04:00,586
No, I didn't.

965
01:04:01,504 --> 01:04:03,714
-Anything else you'd like to say?
-Wait.

966
01:04:04,215 --> 01:04:05,383
Hold on.

967
01:04:06,676 --> 01:04:12,014
When Park Soon-ja collected a large amount
of money, like one or two billion won,

968
01:04:12,098 --> 01:04:14,100
she would send it to Song Jae-hwa.

969
01:04:15,476 --> 01:04:18,020
So, she was basically sending the money
to Yoo Byeong-un.

970
01:04:18,104 --> 01:04:22,191
Then Yoo Byeong-un used that money
to run his company, right?

971
01:04:22,692 --> 01:04:26,737
He would call that money
his "development expenses."

972
01:04:26,821 --> 01:04:31,826
He even labeled the church offerings
as "development expenses" too.

973
01:04:34,620 --> 01:04:37,665
"I disagree. This is a challenge."

974
01:04:38,249 --> 01:04:41,002
This is the note that I got
from the ceiling.

975
01:04:42,044 --> 01:04:46,549
"If we pass this,
the development expenses will increase."

976
01:04:46,632 --> 01:04:49,010
"Keep your mouth shut."

977
01:04:49,510 --> 01:04:53,556
DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES

978
01:04:53,639 --> 01:04:55,766
They said you used the money
to run the company.

979
01:04:55,850 --> 01:04:57,727
What are your thoughts on that?

980
01:04:57,810 --> 01:04:59,854
That never happened.
I never asked for that.

981
01:05:03,232 --> 01:05:06,319
Tracking the checks confirmed
that Park Soon-ja, Five Oceans' CEO,

982
01:05:06,402 --> 01:05:09,947
had sent money from her private loans
to Semo through Song Jae-hwa.

983
01:05:10,031 --> 01:05:11,949
It was also revealed
that CEO Yoo Byeong-un

984
01:05:12,033 --> 01:05:13,826
had led the collection of private loans,

985
01:05:13,910 --> 01:05:15,745
according to the creditors…

986
01:05:18,039 --> 01:05:22,293
Back then, the prosecutors tracked down
their checks and bank accounts.

987
01:05:22,376 --> 01:05:24,253
In the end, the court acknowledged

988
01:05:24,337 --> 01:05:27,632
that 460 million won had been transferred
between them.

989
01:05:27,715 --> 01:05:29,926
If you look at the promissory notes,

990
01:05:30,009 --> 01:05:32,011
some of them were signed by Park Soon-ja,

991
01:05:32,094 --> 01:05:35,848
and some of them were signed
by Yoo Byeong-un.

992
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:40,436
SAMWOO TRADING CO., LTD.
YOO BYEONG-UN, CEO

993
01:05:41,979 --> 01:05:45,191
Yong-ju is Park Soon-ja's younger sister.

994
01:05:45,274 --> 01:05:46,400
It says she went there

995
01:05:46,484 --> 01:05:48,778
for the debt repayment,
as they were suffering.

996
01:05:48,861 --> 01:05:51,155
She went to Samwoo Trading Company

997
01:05:51,238 --> 01:05:53,199
and asked for their debt to be repaid.

998
01:05:53,282 --> 01:05:56,452
And the response was,
"Hey, our company is suffering too."

999
01:05:56,535 --> 01:05:59,997
So they passed a note to the ceiling.
"Samwoo is now suffering a lot too."

1000
01:06:00,081 --> 01:06:02,249
They gave it to Park Soon-ja
on the ceiling.

1001
01:06:02,875 --> 01:06:06,045
When Park Soon-ja realized
that her last hope, Samwoo,

1002
01:06:07,088 --> 01:06:10,216
wouldn't be helping her,

1003
01:06:10,716 --> 01:06:15,554
Park Soon-ja, after getting agreements
from her fervent followers,

1004
01:06:15,638 --> 01:06:18,224
decided to kill themselves together, and…

1005
01:06:18,891 --> 01:06:22,895
She gave the money to Yoo Byeong-un
as development expenses.

1006
01:06:22,979 --> 01:06:28,818
But when the creditors asked her
to pay them the principal and interest,

1007
01:06:28,901 --> 01:06:32,822
she couldn't,
putting her under a lot of pressure.

1008
01:06:33,447 --> 01:06:38,077
So, they kept hiding and running away.

1009
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:41,163
They ended up running away
to Five Oceans in Yongin,

1010
01:06:41,247 --> 01:06:44,583
and committed mass suicide or were killed.

1011
01:06:45,167 --> 01:06:46,836
Well, that's how I see it.

1012
01:06:49,088 --> 01:06:53,592
Look at the notes that Park Soon-ja
exchanged with people below the ceiling.

1013
01:06:53,676 --> 01:06:57,555
It says, "Once the CEO shows up,
things will be resolved."

1014
01:06:58,389 --> 01:06:59,849
Who do you think the CEO was?

1015
01:07:22,079 --> 01:07:25,624
The court didn't have enough evidence
at the time

1016
01:07:25,708 --> 01:07:29,336
on Yoo Byeong-un
and Park Soon-ja's relationship,

1017
01:07:29,420 --> 01:07:34,550
or whether Yoo had played a role
in the mass suicide or homicide.

1018
01:07:35,593 --> 01:07:39,346
The fact that Park Soon-ja
had collected 460 million won

1019
01:07:39,430 --> 01:07:44,018
and sent it to Yoo Byeong-un's company
was acknowledged during the investigation.

1020
01:07:44,101 --> 01:07:47,063
But Yoo Byeong-un
did not receive any punishment

1021
01:07:47,146 --> 01:07:51,233
regarding Five Oceans
because of Park Soon-ja's death.

1022
01:07:51,317 --> 01:07:55,696
He was only charged with habitual fraud
in relation to the money he received

1023
01:07:55,780 --> 01:08:01,744
from people like Song Jae-hwa,
and was sentenced to four years in prison.

1024
01:08:04,330 --> 01:08:06,749
Do you know Song Jae-hwa and Park Soon-ja?

1025
01:08:06,832 --> 01:08:09,001
-No more questions, please.
-Please proceed.

1026
01:08:42,743 --> 01:08:43,828
Definitely a cold case.

1027
01:08:43,911 --> 01:08:46,997
In order for this case to be solved,

1028
01:08:47,540 --> 01:08:51,085
the reasons for the suicides
must become clear.

1029
01:08:53,087 --> 01:08:55,589
However, because this case
has a religious background,

1030
01:08:55,673 --> 01:08:56,966
if they did commit suicide,

1031
01:08:57,049 --> 01:08:59,343
I think it's likely
that they were forced to do so.

1032
01:08:59,426 --> 01:09:01,262
If those people hadn't died there,

1033
01:09:01,345 --> 01:09:04,181
they could have experienced
something much worse.

1034
01:09:06,142 --> 01:09:07,601
They didn't deserve that.

1035
01:09:08,227 --> 01:09:12,314
Seeing those people
who got tangled up in all this,

1036
01:09:12,398 --> 01:09:15,025
I feel so bad for the people who died.

1037
01:09:15,109 --> 01:09:20,739
Somebody has to spill tears of repentance
in order to soothe their souls.

1038
01:09:21,657 --> 01:09:24,076
My job as a journalist aside,
as a human being,

1039
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:28,038
this case still remains
a traumatic moment in my life.

1040
01:09:33,294 --> 01:09:35,671
I hope you're all happy in the afterlife.

1041
01:09:38,090 --> 01:09:41,051
THE BODIES WERE THE ONLY DIRECT EVIDENCE
IN THE FIVE OCEANS CASE

1042
01:09:41,135 --> 01:09:43,012
BUT MOST OF THEM WERE CREMATED
WITHIN TWO DAYS

1043
01:09:43,095 --> 01:09:45,681
AFTERWARD, A CREMATION DOCUMENT
WAS FOUND WITH TAMPERED DEATH DATES

1044
01:09:45,764 --> 01:09:50,644
THE DOCUMENT THAT SHOWS THE DEATH DATES
CHANGED FROM AUG 29 TO AUG 27

1045
01:09:52,646 --> 01:09:55,024
FOOTAGE OF FORMER PRESIDENT
CHUN DOO-HWAN VISITING SAMWOO

1046
01:09:55,107 --> 01:09:58,402
THE COURT DID NOT ACKNOWLEDGE

1047
01:09:58,485 --> 01:10:02,239
THAT YOO BYEONG-UN HAD BEEN
BEHIND THE 32 DEATHS

1048
01:10:02,323 --> 01:10:04,992
YOO BYEONG-UN WAS INVOLVED
IN THE SEWOL FERRY DISASTER

1049
01:10:05,075 --> 01:10:07,745
IN WHICH 299 PEOPLE DIED,
AS HE WAS THE CEO OF THE FERRY COMPANY

1050
01:10:07,828 --> 01:10:11,540
IN 2014, HIS DEAD BODY WAS FOUND ON A HILL

1051
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:17,963
FORMER ASSEMBLYMAN KIM HYEON OWNS A FARM
NEAR THE FIVE OCEANS FACTORY IN YONGIN

1052
01:10:18,047 --> 01:10:19,840
AND STILL VISITS THE FACTORY
A FEW TIMES A YEAR

1053
01:10:19,924 --> 01:10:21,800
HE STILL ARGUES
THAT THE VICTIMS WERE MURDERED

1054
01:10:32,603 --> 01:10:34,271
ALL INTERVIEWS IN THIS DOCUMENTARY
USE REAL TESTIMONIES

1055
01:10:34,355 --> 01:10:36,482
TO PROTECT THE SUBJECT'S IDENTITY,
SOME INTERVIEWS HAVE BEEN REENACTED
