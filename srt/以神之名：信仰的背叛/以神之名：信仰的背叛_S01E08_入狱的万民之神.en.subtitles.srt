THE FOLLOWING EPISODE CONTAINS
DESCRIPTIONS OF SEXUAL ABUSE

2
00:00:08,299 --> 00:00:09,592
WHICH MAY BE DISTURBING FOR SOME VIEWERS

3
00:00:09,676 --> 00:00:11,428
IF YOU OR SOMEONE YOU KNOW
HAS EXPERIENCED SEXUAL ABUSE

FOR MORE INFORMATION AND CRISIS RESOURCES

5
00:00:20,645 --> 00:00:22,397
You've never thought it was wrong?

6
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,314
No.

7
00:00:23,398 --> 00:00:25,608
-So you're always completely obedient?
-Yeah.

8
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:27,318
It's not even that weird.

9
00:00:27,402 --> 00:00:28,778
Why isn't it weird?

10
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:30,613
Do you have to do everything he says?

11
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:32,741
Like if he asks women
to have sex with him?

12
00:00:33,658 --> 00:00:36,619
Pastor Lee is God.
That makes everything okay.

13
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:39,706
If the Father says it's not a sin,
then it's not a sin.

14
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:44,210
"Anyone in love would do this."

15
00:00:44,919 --> 00:00:46,046
Because he's God.

16
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:50,216
He said, "I want to see your breasts."
Then he asked me to take my clothes off.

17
00:00:50,925 --> 00:00:52,761
And he kept telling me to moan.

18
00:00:53,595 --> 00:00:56,973
He examines that "part" very closely.

19
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:58,641
He just keeps staring at it.

20
00:01:00,101 --> 00:01:02,020
Even if people can see my flaws,

21
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:05,106
even if I kissed someone,

22
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:08,943
and even if I laid next to them,

23
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:10,987
I believe that you will all forgive me.

24
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:13,239
But I have no shame in front of God.

25
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:15,283
I truly have no shame in front of God.

26
00:01:21,706 --> 00:01:22,749
MANMIN CENTRAL CHURCH

27
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,461
IN THE NAME OF GOD: A HOLY BETRAYAL

28
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:38,932
GOD OF MANMIN WHO WENT TO PRISON

29
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:43,978
Our beloved members of Manmin,

30
00:01:45,396 --> 00:01:48,691
welcome to the castle of the pastor.

31
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:57,700
For the believers of Manmin,
our Father is preparing

32
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:02,122
a place as beautiful as this.

33
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:07,669
So there are five levels to Heaven.

34
00:02:07,752 --> 00:02:09,087
So, on the first level,

35
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:12,048
you enter a place called Paradise.

36
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:15,343
The second level
is the 1st Kingdom of Heaven.

37
00:02:16,761 --> 00:02:18,763
Above that is the 2nd Kingdom of Heaven.

38
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:21,558
The 3rd Kingdom of Heaven next.

39
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:24,644
At the very top is New Jerusalem.

40
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,567
In Paradise, you just live
in the grass fields forever.

41
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:33,361
There are apartments in the 1st Kingdom.

42
00:02:33,444 --> 00:02:35,989
In the 2nd Kingdom,
you get to live in a house.

43
00:02:36,072 --> 00:02:38,116
In the 3rd Kingdom,
you are given a castle.

44
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:42,453
You get an entire palace in New Jerusalem.
That's what they teach you.

45
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,054
Amen!

46
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:04,184
Yes, it's very big.
The main castles are as spacious

47
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:09,063
as several millions of square meters.

48
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:12,358
There's an ocean there too
and a lake that you all love.

49
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:14,736
My goal in life was to end up there.

50
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:16,654
The best place?

51
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:19,073
The place closest to the Throne of God.

52
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:21,075
They called it the Measure of Faith,

53
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:23,161
and they started to take advantage of it.

54
00:03:23,244 --> 00:03:25,330
On a piece of paper,

55
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:28,791
they would put a number
to your current faith and hand that out.

56
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:30,835
"Your faith is 30% on the second level."

57
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:32,545
"Yours is 70% on the third level."

58
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:35,173
So whilst people were going crazy over it,

59
00:03:35,673 --> 00:03:37,175
they were also anxious and tense.

60
00:03:37,258 --> 00:03:39,219
People who get a high Measure of Faith

61
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:41,679
become celebrities
and breeze through the ranks.

62
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:46,559
But those who get a low Measure
fall behind the others.

63
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:52,357
I became so desperate
to get a higher Measure of Faith.

64
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:57,237
So I started to sow more,
give more, and invest more.

65
00:03:58,863 --> 00:03:59,906
Yes!

66
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:04,369
I think I got to three percent
on the fourth level.

67
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:09,165
I was around 40% on the third level.

68
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:14,337
I was on the third level
with 60-point-something percent.

69
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,631
You were said to be on "the rock"

70
00:04:16,714 --> 00:04:18,758
if you were over 60% on the third level.

71
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:20,343
I got there pretty early.

72
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:22,470
I got there early, so I was very happy.

73
00:04:22,553 --> 00:04:24,806
I think I was around 800th place
or something,

74
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:26,599
out of 15,000 people.

75
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:28,810
It was like your rank in Heaven.

76
00:04:28,893 --> 00:04:32,146
So 800th place was a very impressive rank.

77
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,898
MANMIN CENTRAL CHURCH

78
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:36,067
If you never climbed up to "the rock,"

79
00:04:36,734 --> 00:04:39,279
if you never received
a single word for years,

80
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:41,823
if you never received the Measure
for a long time,

81
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:45,159
there's a reason
why you haven't made it yet.

82
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:46,869
You need to find out the reason.

83
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:50,498
Looking back, people who paid a lot
got a good Measure of Faith,

84
00:04:50,581 --> 00:04:52,375
and those who didn't pay a lot didn't.

85
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:54,377
That's the conclusion I've come to.

86
00:04:59,757 --> 00:05:05,972
THOU SHALT NOT STEAL

87
00:05:06,055 --> 00:05:07,307
MANMIN CENTRAL CHURCH

88
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:09,892
In a way, you could say this sermon

89
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:13,813
is actually a continuation
of the sermon on Hell.

90
00:05:13,896 --> 00:05:15,940
If you don't pay your tithe and offerings,

91
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:20,111
you must know
that God will place a curse upon you.

92
00:05:20,194 --> 00:05:21,029
Amen.

93
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:22,405
I see it way too often.

94
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:25,908
See, if someone gets into a car crash

95
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:29,662
and breaks and shatters their bones

96
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:32,623
or suffers a brain hemorrhage,

97
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:35,918
it's always the same answer. It's obvious.

98
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:38,296
They didn't pay proper tithes, right?

99
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:52,518
An offering of thanks,
sanctuary-building offering,

100
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:55,605
charity offering, special offering,

101
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:59,275
offerings made in group services,
the Feast of Harvest offering,

102
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:00,985
Easter offering.

103
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:03,780
There was also a Christmas offering

104
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:05,615
and a tithe.

105
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:07,909
The tithe was made before the tax.

106
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:13,414
Some say that they can't pay the tithe

107
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:16,626
because they're unemployed
and don't have an income.

108
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:19,921
But every single person can pay the tithe.

109
00:06:20,004 --> 00:06:24,217
Even very young children have income
from New Year's, allowances,

110
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:28,054
100-day celebrations,
first birthdays, and other birthdays.

111
00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:34,102
The parents can pay the tithe
in their child's name with that income.

112
00:06:39,273 --> 00:06:43,027
There are two ways to give money
in Manmin Central Church.

113
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:44,654
Offerings and gifts.

114
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:48,282
Offerings are what you call the money
you give in offering envelopes.

115
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:50,326
But gifts are money given unofficially.

116
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,079
So, offerings are a separate thing.

117
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:55,957
The members pay offerings
and gifts separately,

118
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:59,544
so the members of the church
really don't have any money to live.

119
00:06:59,627 --> 00:07:02,380
Despite all that,
they scrape together some money,

120
00:07:02,463 --> 00:07:04,924
even if they went into debt,
to sow their offerings.

121
00:07:05,007 --> 00:07:10,430
He put the church members
in competition against one another

122
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:12,974
to see who pays the most.
"So-and-so gets first place."

123
00:07:13,057 --> 00:07:16,477
"This elder gets second place.
That elder gets third place."

124
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,980
"Lee Kwang-oh is in seventh place."

125
00:07:19,063 --> 00:07:23,901
I think I paid over a billion won
over the course of 24 years.

126
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:26,904
I think my entire family
paid over a billion won too.

127
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:31,909
At the very least, it's 800 million.
But I think I paid over a billion won.

128
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:35,913
There were so many people
that were taken advantage of financially.

129
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:39,375
These people dedicated their whole lives
to giving offerings to the church.

130
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:42,128
He's an atrocious man

131
00:07:42,211 --> 00:07:48,134
who brainwashed them all
and then used that for his own gain.

132
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:58,686
Many members of Manmin Central Church

133
00:07:58,769 --> 00:08:02,648
have a very low quality of life.

134
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:04,650
In terms of monthly earnings,

135
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:09,906
it's probably fair to say most members
are at the bottom of the ladder.

136
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:13,242
Despite that, they gave
a lot of offerings to the church.

137
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:14,285
MANMIN CENTRAL CHURCH

138
00:08:14,368 --> 00:08:17,455
How did that happen?
The members would work part-time.

139
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:19,415
Hey, bring this to that table.

140
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:25,671
These housewives worked so hard
to earn that money.

141
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:29,217
Five million, ten million won.

142
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,344
Not only did they barely have
enough to live,

143
00:08:31,427 --> 00:08:33,387
but a lot of them also went into debt.

144
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:35,932
You usually leave the church
after a service, right?

145
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:39,769
But in Manmin Central Church,
the members all line up after a service.

146
00:08:40,978 --> 00:08:43,481
-Pastor Lee!
-Pastor Lee!

147
00:08:43,564 --> 00:08:44,774
Pastor Lee!

148
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:47,068
Our entire family supports you!

149
00:08:47,151 --> 00:08:48,444
Sure. Thank you.

150
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:52,156
If you grabbed Lee Jae-rock's hand
and asked him to pray, his car stopped.

151
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:58,829
Then a member might get a minute
of prayer, 20 seconds, or 30 seconds.

152
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:03,167
There's someone in the car
collecting the money envelopes.

153
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:05,461
He's the director of planning.

154
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:08,130
As far as I know,
there were thousands of people

155
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:11,884
who paid millions of won in offerings
to receive his benediction.

156
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:14,512
May Jesus lay his hand upon you in prayer.

157
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:15,471
Amen.

158
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:18,724
Show us the inspiration, influence,
and greatness of the Holy Spirit.

159
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:19,684
Amen.

160
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:21,644
We pray you'll surround us with light.

161
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:22,645
Amen.

162
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:25,314
So, there is a missionary meeting
for businesspeople,

163
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:27,275
influential people who paid a lot.

164
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:29,485
We were invited to that meeting.

165
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:33,614
When you go, they collect around three
to five million won from each person.

166
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:35,491
The tithe from August…

167
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:40,204
There were six or seven people who said

168
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:42,498
they will pay more than ten million won,

169
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:44,750
but now, there are more than 12.

170
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:45,668
Amen.

171
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:48,212
-I'll become your joy, Father.
-Sure. All right.

172
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:50,089
Let's go to the car to receive prayers.

173
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:51,424
-Sure.
-Over here.

174
00:09:52,341 --> 00:09:54,302
-Okay.
-Come on, come out.

175
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:56,429
-Yes.
-Let us have a hug.

176
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:59,223
I got a new car for you, Pastor Lee.

177
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:01,225
Where is it from?

178
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:03,060
Germany. It's a German car.

179
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:08,107
-Our Father, please bless this car.
-Amen.

180
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:09,984
-Please bless the key as well.
-Amen.

181
00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:11,611
-Bless your light upon it.
-Amen.

182
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:13,863
I pray in the name of Jesus Christ.

183
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:15,156
-Amen.
-Amen.

184
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:21,621
You had to pay to take a picture
with Pastor Lee.

185
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:24,915
I don't remember the exact amount,

186
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:27,543
but it started
around hundreds of thousands of won.

187
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:31,964
Later, there were so many members
hoping to take a picture with Pastor Lee.

188
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:34,467
I remember the price going up
to at least a million.

189
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:38,179
I'm pretty sure I gave ten million won
in offerings to take this picture.

190
00:10:54,111 --> 00:10:55,988
These are all pictures
I paid to have taken.

191
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:00,618
I had over 40 of those framed pictures.

192
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:09,335
Let's say one costs 10 million won,
that's over 200 million in total.

193
00:11:11,253 --> 00:11:14,382
Manmin Central Church had a bookstore
called Manmin Bookstore.

194
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:17,677
They sold framed pictures of Lee Jae-rock

195
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:22,056
or key rings or notebooks,
merchandise like that.

196
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:24,266
So people buy these things one by one.

197
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:27,061
In a way, it's a really shrewd business.

198
00:11:27,144 --> 00:11:30,564
The funniest one for me
was Muan Sweet Water.

199
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:37,196
These people put Muan Sweet Water
in these spray bottles

200
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:39,156
to make it easier to use too.

201
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,575
It was incredulous.
Then they would sell them.

202
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:43,953
You could spray it on
to get double eyelids.

203
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:47,331
A broken washing machine
would work again if you spray on it.

204
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:52,795
Muan Sweet Water worked its miracle
on a broken washing machine as well.

205
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:55,923
After I sprayed the Sweet Water,
tightened it, and turned it back on,

206
00:11:56,006 --> 00:11:57,341
the water didn't leak at all.

207
00:11:57,425 --> 00:11:59,969
So when I turn it on now,
it's working fine,

208
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:01,887
so everything turned out well like this.

209
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:03,681
I think it's because it's so cold.

210
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:05,766
Oh, no. It's not opening.

211
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:08,227
The door remained locked
for over 50 minutes,

212
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:10,020
but it opened with a "click"

213
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:13,190
after it was sprayed
with Muan Sweet Water.

214
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:25,578
To Manmin Central Church,
Muan Sweet Water is like a cure-all

215
00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:27,580
for the members of the church.

216
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:31,876
They say there's this light, this power
in this Muan Sweet Water

217
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:35,212
because Lee Jae-rock prayed over it.

218
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:39,300
So, they claim
that you can experience a miracle

219
00:12:39,383 --> 00:12:42,344
if you drink the water
or put it on yourself.

220
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:50,811
There was a thing called the mailbox

221
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:53,314
that was like ARS that you could call.

222
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:57,485
And you could listen
to pre-recorded messages from Pastor Lee.

223
00:12:57,568 --> 00:12:59,403
This is Manmin Central Church.

224
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:02,406
Press ten to start your day
with Pastor Lee's prayers.

225
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:04,241
Press 20 to hear a prayer for safety.

226
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:07,661
Press 30 for a three-minute sermon.
Press 40 for a prayer for the ill.

227
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:10,539
Before my grandfather passed away,

228
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:12,833
he was in the hospital.

229
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:14,710
I really wanted him to get better.

230
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:18,881
So, I remember playing Lee Jae-rock's
prayers for the ill for him.

231
00:13:19,715 --> 00:13:22,384
Let me begin the prayer for the ill.

232
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:25,596
Place your hand on the place
where it hurts or feels weak.

233
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:28,265
If you're not ill,
place your hand over your heart…

234
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:29,975
He listened to it for a while,

235
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:34,271
then he looked at me like he wanted me
to take the earphones out.

236
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:38,984
But I remember I made him listen
to the whole thing as I wanted him to.

237
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:44,406
I should have just spoken to him more
or gone on a trip with him.

238
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:51,622
In actuality, it's all about money
in the end.

239
00:13:51,705 --> 00:13:53,874
The church is denying it,

240
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:56,961
but they saved up
an enormous amount of money.

241
00:13:57,753 --> 00:13:59,338
If you paid over three million won,

242
00:13:59,421 --> 00:14:01,924
you could meet Lee with others
who also paid the same.

243
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:05,177
Those who paid over five million
would meet him together.

244
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:06,971
The same for ten million won.

245
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:09,223
If you paid the most,
you'd meet him privately.

246
00:14:09,306 --> 00:14:11,517
Those people usually paid
around 100 million won.

247
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:15,646
How did the church treat the people
who paid that much money?

248
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:17,815
The church

249
00:14:17,898 --> 00:14:21,485
basically treated you like a VIP,
more or less.

250
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:24,738
There were people
who were dressed in really pretty hanbok.

251
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:26,907
Those people came to reserve

252
00:14:27,783 --> 00:14:31,287
special seats for us,
right at the very front of the hall.

253
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:34,665
That basically makes you
the envy of Manmin Central Church.

254
00:14:34,748 --> 00:14:37,293
"Wow, that's not a place
for just anybody."

255
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:40,921
"They must have given a lot of offerings
and sowed a lot to Pastor Lee."

256
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:44,967
Honestly, back then, it felt pretty nice.

257
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:48,345
Because of that,
my dad paid at least three million,

258
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:51,348
up to tens of millions of won
each year at the devotion worship

259
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:53,684
to have my older sister sit
at the very front.

260
00:14:53,767 --> 00:14:57,730
If you gave more money,
you got the right to sit up front.

261
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,483
Why is it important
to sit in the front row?

262
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:05,154
Because you got to be the closest
to Pastor Lee.

263
00:15:10,367 --> 00:15:14,330
THOU SHALT NOT KILL

264
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:20,794
Illnesses happen
as a result of the curse of sins.

265
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:23,255
You'll never be ill if you don't sin.

266
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:27,426
Have you ever seen anyone become ill
when they obey the words and never sin?

267
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:28,469
Amen.

268
00:15:29,553 --> 00:15:31,305
If you catch a deadly illness,

269
00:15:31,388 --> 00:15:35,225
it means that you committed a sin worthy
of death, a sin that will lead to death.

270
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:38,520
"Only the sinners get ill.
You're ill because you sinned."

271
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:42,608
People thought that going to the hospital
reflected a lack of faith.

272
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:45,903
That's because Lee Jae-rock
was always proud to say,

273
00:15:46,695 --> 00:15:48,197
"Our members never get sick."

274
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:51,909
In reality, they were very minor illnesses
that could have been cured

275
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:54,536
if they were treated early on.

276
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:58,207
But because they just prayed about it,
many people died from tuberculosis.

277
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:00,709
It's been with the church for a long time.

278
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:03,337
You could even say
it's a part of the church's history.

279
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:06,298
The Performing Arts Committee members

280
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:09,259
are in their twenties or thirties
on average.

281
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:13,681
They all sing and dance together.

282
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:15,057
They're also young,

283
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:17,267
so they are more active.

284
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:18,519
Fruits of joy

285
00:16:18,602 --> 00:16:19,770
Fruits of joy

286
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:25,192
I am changed

287
00:16:25,275 --> 00:16:27,820
I am changed

288
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:31,198
His love saved me

289
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:36,662
So many beautiful people
ended up passing away like that.

290
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:42,167
My wife…

291
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:47,089
She passed away in 2006.

292
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:55,431
Hello, dear beloved believers. I'm Kim…

293
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:57,599
After the 100th episode special,

294
00:16:57,683 --> 00:17:00,936
God showed his great power
through Pastor Lee…

295
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:01,937
She was

296
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:05,524
this really pretty girl who was a part
of the Hallelujah Praising Team.

297
00:17:05,607 --> 00:17:10,863
She was so slender
and had this super feminine voice.

298
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:15,075
She was brushing her teeth,

299
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:17,995
then she ran up to me
with toothpaste still in her mouth,

300
00:17:19,913 --> 00:17:21,123
saying she was bleeding.

301
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,918
So I said we should go
to the hospital, and…

302
00:17:28,922 --> 00:17:30,007
She had tuberculosis.

303
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:33,969
Faith was supposed to be our treatment,

304
00:17:34,636 --> 00:17:36,638
and she was in the faithful praise team.

305
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,767
So, when we first found out about it,

306
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:44,104
she said she'd get treatment
through faith.

307
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:50,986
She said, "I was supposed
to only love Lee Jae-rock."

308
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:55,866
"I got this illness because I got married,
and I'm going to die from it."

309
00:17:56,366 --> 00:17:58,452
So she was a sinner even as she died.

310
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,830
If you catch a deadly illness,

311
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:04,333
it means that you committed
a sin worthy of death,

312
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:05,793
a sin that will lead to death.

313
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:30,526
When she was about to pass away,

314
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:32,945
she was…

315
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:34,988
so skinny.

316
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:38,659
And her lungs were basically gone.

317
00:18:41,578 --> 00:18:42,454
And she…

318
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:46,083
She died a painful death.

319
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:06,061
Even aside from tuberculosis,
a lot of people suffered from cancer.

320
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:08,897
When I saw that happen,
I thought, "What is faith?"

321
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:11,984
"Is it really faith to stop people
from going to hospitals,

322
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:14,236
causing many people to die like this?"

323
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:15,487
That's what I thought.

324
00:19:19,616 --> 00:19:22,911
THOU SHALT NOT COMMIT ADULTERY

325
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:27,916
The reason you're affected
by evil spirits,

326
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,459
as also mentioned in the sermon,

327
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:32,129
is because of adultery.
People who commit adultery.

328
00:19:32,796 --> 00:19:36,425
They are possessed by evil spirits,
but they have no idea.

329
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:40,387
They have adulterous spirits,
so they want to do it.

330
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:43,223
So they keep doing it,
also committing crimes.

331
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:46,727
They don't realize they're possessed
and controlled by the evil spirits.

332
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:50,439
Lee Jae-rock always emphasized adultery.

333
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:52,274
Relationships between men and women.

334
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:54,359
And he always said,

335
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:56,862
"As I don't have
any adulterous spirits in me,

336
00:19:56,945 --> 00:19:58,447
even when I see a naked woman,

337
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:00,616
I don't feel anything."
He said it quite often.

338
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:05,287
At one point, they started
to divide up the men and women.

339
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:08,999
They said,
"Don't sit next to each other."

340
00:20:09,082 --> 00:20:11,001
"Don't even be in the same space."

341
00:20:11,084 --> 00:20:13,045
For example, a man and a woman

342
00:20:13,128 --> 00:20:15,214
couldn't talk to each other directly.

343
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:16,673
So, what do you need to do?

344
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:18,675
You had to talk to the other person

345
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:21,803
through your female sibling,

346
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,430
or someone like that.

347
00:20:23,513 --> 00:20:28,769
In my case, my younger sister
would relay my message,

348
00:20:28,852 --> 00:20:31,146
and when the other person
gave her a response,

349
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,898
she passed that message on to me.

350
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:38,862
There was an incident involving
the letters of repentance in 2010.

351
00:20:40,113 --> 00:20:42,616
"It turns out that the members
have too many sins."

352
00:20:42,699 --> 00:20:44,785
"All of you have led such sinful lives."

353
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:47,412
I did not think

354
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:50,582
that such sinners

355
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:52,626
would be a part of our church.

356
00:20:52,709 --> 00:20:54,836
There are some people

357
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,881
who gave in to their sexual desires
and acted indecently.

358
00:20:57,965 --> 00:21:02,010
They said, "If you write a letter
to Lee Jae-rock about your wrongdoings,

359
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:03,512
your sins will be forgiven."

360
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:05,806
I have cried out in tears…

361
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:17,943
I cried out so that not a single soul
would go to Hell, but…

362
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:23,490
But I didn't know it'd be this bad.

363
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:31,999
I didn't know this pain
would make my life so unbearable.

364
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:37,421
Please show compassion for us
during this time and forgive us.

365
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:39,548
Your son begs of you.

366
00:21:45,762 --> 00:21:47,097
I'm begging you.

367
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:53,937
We had to confess
our biggest secrets and weaknesses.

368
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:57,607
I had to remember holding hands
with somebody when I was seven

369
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:01,111
and what I did with some upperclassman
when I was 20.

370
00:22:02,112 --> 00:22:04,197
"What about with an underclassman?"

371
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:07,617
I had to remember everything
and try to put it down.

372
00:22:07,701 --> 00:22:09,244
That's what happened.

373
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:12,414
Once everybody started writing
their letters of repentance,

374
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:16,001
it became a mandatory thing
for all the church members.

375
00:22:16,084 --> 00:22:18,253
Without writing a letter of repentance,

376
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:22,632
you'd be on the edge of a cliff,
questioning whether you'd be saved or not.

377
00:22:22,716 --> 00:22:27,971
If you are still committing
those deadly sins,

378
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:30,974
do you not feel bad for your poor pastor?

379
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:33,352
Is it really that hard to believe?

380
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:36,605
If you commit a deadly sin, you'll die.

381
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:39,358
Just like it says in the Bible.
There is no salvation.

382
00:22:40,108 --> 00:22:42,277
You know, this topic is kind of…

383
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:44,363
I feel kind of bad talking about this.

384
00:22:44,946 --> 00:22:46,740
This might really hurt that person.

385
00:22:46,823 --> 00:22:49,576
Because their family
is still having a really hard time.

386
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:54,331
He was a bit…

387
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:59,628
He was a person with a free spirit.
He dated a lot of people.

388
00:23:00,587 --> 00:23:03,757
He was a huge extrovert, you know?

389
00:23:06,927 --> 00:23:10,514
PLEASE NOTE THIS FOOTAGE IS NOT RELATED
TO THE ACTUAL VICTIM

390
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:19,898
He ran into several problems with women.

391
00:23:19,981 --> 00:23:23,652
Then Lee Jae-rock found out
about those problems with women.

392
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:28,698
Then that ended up being
a huge disadvantage for him.

393
00:23:28,782 --> 00:23:31,743
He said, "You can't be saved."
Simply, "It's a work of the flesh."

394
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:34,871
He cut his thing off.

395
00:23:36,957 --> 00:23:38,583
He cut his genitals off.

396
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:42,212
You could see biological
and physical differences.

397
00:23:42,295 --> 00:23:44,172
He started to become more feminine.

398
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:46,466
He was a bodyguard who enjoyed exercising.

399
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:48,844
But he's so skinny now.

400
00:23:49,553 --> 00:23:51,847
He has no muscles
and no facial hair either.

401
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:56,351
Those things shouldn't have happened.
They were just illogical.

402
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:58,979
And they didn't just happen
to one or two people.

403
00:23:59,062 --> 00:24:02,566
There are at least around ten people
just from what I know.

404
00:24:03,733 --> 00:24:07,154
He had such blind faith
and thought it was the right thing to do.

405
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:10,282
Who on earth cuts it off?
But he ended up doing it.

406
00:24:11,324 --> 00:24:12,868
I looked into it as well.

407
00:24:15,745 --> 00:24:18,665
And when I looked into it,
he told me where in Gangwon-do it was,

408
00:24:18,748 --> 00:24:20,208
as well as how much it had cost.

409
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:21,418
It was done illegally.

410
00:24:21,918 --> 00:24:25,130
He said it took three to five days
to recover from the surgery.

411
00:24:25,213 --> 00:24:26,715
He said it wasn't that hard.

412
00:24:31,761 --> 00:24:34,181
Lee Jae-rock was especially sensitive

413
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:38,518
about things like dating someone
from the Performing Arts Committee.

414
00:24:42,189 --> 00:24:45,150
There were many pretty girls in Manmin,
like I said.

415
00:24:45,233 --> 00:24:48,612
I think he thought
that all of those girls belonged to him.

416
00:24:48,695 --> 00:24:53,325
But if they dated
or slept with another man,

417
00:24:53,408 --> 00:24:56,328
I think he considered them
dirty or contaminated.

418
00:24:56,411 --> 00:24:58,955
Why? Because he had to have them.

419
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:00,916
Because other men can't have them.

420
00:25:11,384 --> 00:25:13,929
Manmin Central Church's Pastor Lee
is being accused

421
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:15,889
of sexually assaulting nine women…

422
00:25:16,473 --> 00:25:18,808
The police believe that the sexual assault

423
00:25:18,892 --> 00:25:21,061
happened frequently
over a long period of time.

424
00:25:23,563 --> 00:25:25,398
You denied all of your charges.

425
00:25:25,482 --> 00:25:27,108
Are you saying you didn't have sex?

426
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:30,070
This is dangerous.
Please, he's walking here…

427
00:25:30,153 --> 00:25:31,988
-Are you denying you had sex?
-He's hurt…

428
00:25:32,072 --> 00:25:33,657
Go. You can just go.

429
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:37,244
Are you denying the intercourse
or just the sexual assault?

430
00:25:37,327 --> 00:25:39,120
-Excuse me.
-I denied everything.

431
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:41,873
Then why did you call
for your followers at night?

432
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:45,418
They hated it when you asked for sex.
Why did you call them at night?

433
00:25:45,502 --> 00:25:46,795
I never did that.

434
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:48,296
-You never did that?
-No.

435
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:50,090
-Any words…
-Ms. Choi, excuse us.

436
00:25:50,173 --> 00:25:52,926
-Any words of apology for the victims?
-Uh, Ms. Choi.

437
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:55,262
Excuse me, Ms. Choi.

438
00:25:58,598 --> 00:25:59,933
Watch your legs, sir.

439
00:26:03,603 --> 00:26:06,523
Well, it was just unbelievable.
It was unbelievable.

440
00:26:06,606 --> 00:26:09,568
I was like,
"Something like this couldn't happen."

441
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:10,610
I mean…

442
00:26:10,694 --> 00:26:13,989
Who could have imagined
that he could be a sex offender?

443
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:16,116
I thought they were false rumors.

444
00:26:16,199 --> 00:26:18,410
Manmin Church and its members

445
00:26:18,493 --> 00:26:22,080
do not acknowledge the claims
of Pastor Lee's sexual assault.

446
00:26:22,163 --> 00:26:25,375
We believe that such accusations
will be revealed to be false,

447
00:26:25,458 --> 00:26:26,418
as we're waiting.

448
00:26:27,043 --> 00:26:30,880
Number one,
stop all false claims right now!

449
00:26:30,964 --> 00:26:34,217
Stop them!

450
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:38,471
Manmin will prove Pastor Lee's innocence.

451
00:26:38,555 --> 00:26:41,474
We'll prove it!

452
00:26:41,558 --> 00:26:44,144
When we first started gathering material
for this piece,

453
00:26:44,644 --> 00:26:48,440
we thought he was just a leader of a cult.

454
00:26:49,316 --> 00:26:54,696
But we never imagined
that he was such a serious criminal.

455
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:57,782
Another sexual assault victim
filed a lawsuit

456
00:26:57,866 --> 00:27:00,285
against Pastor Lee Jae-rock
of Manmin Central Church,

457
00:27:00,368 --> 00:27:04,623
who is being investigated
for sexually assaulting his followers.

458
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:05,915
Reporter Lee Moon-hyeon.

459
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:10,670
She says she was sexually assaulted
by Pastor Lee of Manmin Central Church…

460
00:27:11,212 --> 00:27:12,505
The female victim

461
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:16,301
was like a leader

462
00:27:16,384 --> 00:27:19,179
among the younger church members.

463
00:27:19,262 --> 00:27:20,388
MANMIN CENTRAL CHURCH

464
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:23,558
She brought in the evidence,

465
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:26,978
as well as the pictures
that she took with Lee Jae-rock.

466
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:36,363
Up until now, I learned things
like virtue, honesty, and love.

467
00:27:36,863 --> 00:27:38,698
I loved learning about those things…

468
00:27:40,617 --> 00:27:45,538
She was very specific about the last time,
as well as the location,

469
00:27:45,622 --> 00:27:48,833
she had been sexually assaulted
by Lee Jae-rock.

470
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:52,671
These are information
only the victim herself would know,

471
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:54,464
so I knew I could trust her story.

472
00:27:58,218 --> 00:28:04,265
She said she first received a call
from Lee Jae-rock in 2011.

473
00:28:11,564 --> 00:28:12,857
Yeah, all right.

474
00:28:15,443 --> 00:28:19,531
She said she was ecstatic.
You see, she was born with the religion.

475
00:28:20,782 --> 00:28:24,119
This man who she believed to be God,
to be the absolute good,

476
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:27,330
who she thought was so noble,
had given her a call.

477
00:28:28,123 --> 00:28:32,877
"Oh, maybe he wants to talk to me
about my Measure of Faith in private."

478
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:37,006
"Or maybe he'll assign me
a duty and title."

479
00:28:47,267 --> 00:28:50,186
He said, "Yeah, right here.
You can come to the apartment."

480
00:28:50,854 --> 00:28:54,566
"Nobody knows about this place,
so come without telling anybody."

481
00:28:59,195 --> 00:29:02,615
I took a taxi. I took a taxi there.

482
00:29:03,324 --> 00:29:07,746
He was pretty careful.
He said, "Don't use a card. Use cash."

483
00:29:17,297 --> 00:29:21,259
They wanted to show Pastor Lee
their conviction,

484
00:29:21,342 --> 00:29:23,094
so they dipped into their savings,

485
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:26,014
withdrew the money in cash,
and put it in an envelope.

486
00:29:26,097 --> 00:29:29,809
Then they changed
into their cleanest and whitest clothes.

487
00:29:30,685 --> 00:29:34,105
I felt so nervous
when I pressed the doorbell.

488
00:29:36,733 --> 00:29:38,318
I was praying on my way there.

489
00:29:39,152 --> 00:29:43,573
Then even the way he poked his head out
was so shocking to me.

490
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:50,163
As soon as I went inside,
I saw a large mattress in the living room.

491
00:30:24,531 --> 00:30:28,034
The stories of the victims
were eerily similar.

492
00:30:28,117 --> 00:30:30,453
They were all invited to his house
out of the blue.

493
00:30:36,751 --> 00:30:38,336
He told them, "I am God."

494
00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:41,965
"So, there's nothing wrong
with the things that will happen here."

495
00:30:42,048 --> 00:30:46,845
Or he said, "This is the Garden of Eden.
Therefore, you must not be clothed."

496
00:30:46,928 --> 00:30:49,347
That's what he told the victims.

497
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:51,516
And also, the sad thing is

498
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:55,645
that the victims didn't realize
what was happening to them.

499
00:30:57,021 --> 00:30:58,690
I couldn't think straight.

500
00:30:58,773 --> 00:31:00,817
TESTIMONY OF A FEMALE VICTIM
OF SEXUAL ASSAULT

501
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:01,818
"What's going on?"

502
00:31:02,443 --> 00:31:05,154
"Is it okay for him to do this
because he's sinless?"

503
00:31:05,238 --> 00:31:07,657
"Wait, what is this? What's going on?"

504
00:31:09,742 --> 00:31:12,453
"Oh, this must be his grace
to protect me from other men,

505
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:15,582
so that I can love only the Father."

506
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:19,544
As I prayed for about a month,

507
00:31:19,627 --> 00:31:22,213
I think I decided to accept it, thinking,

508
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:24,799
"Oh, that must have truly been
God's grace."

509
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:49,657
He wasn't God. He was the Devil.

510
00:31:52,076 --> 00:31:55,079
He said, "Just by touching my body,
you'll be healed."

511
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:57,790
He also said,
"You are in the presence of God."

512
00:31:57,874 --> 00:32:00,710
"You'll go to Heaven. You'll be saved."

513
00:32:00,793 --> 00:32:03,129
He was the Devil pretending to be a sheep.

514
00:32:09,344 --> 00:32:11,054
He started unclasping my bra.

515
00:32:11,137 --> 00:32:15,350
I was really surprised
because he was so good at it.

516
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:18,019
"Who does your ***** belong to,
Jeong-hye?"

517
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:21,814
He examines that "part" very closely.

518
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:24,609
He just keeps staring at it.

519
00:32:27,987 --> 00:32:31,366
He brought my face closer to his genitals.

520
00:32:31,991 --> 00:32:34,744
Then he said, "That's not how you do it."

521
00:32:34,827 --> 00:32:36,496
"It hurts if you use your teeth."

522
00:32:38,331 --> 00:32:42,919
While we were having intercourse,
he kept asking me if it felt good.

523
00:32:43,002 --> 00:32:44,963
And he kept telling me to moan.

524
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:47,090
He was like, "Do you like that?"

525
00:32:48,925 --> 00:32:53,221
You know, everyone just watches on
as he has sex with my friends.

526
00:33:01,604 --> 00:33:05,274
He told us to watch some porn and practice
because we were too inexperienced.

527
00:33:06,025 --> 00:33:11,197
So the assistant would play porn for us,
and you'd hear moaning.

528
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:15,159
PLEASE NOTE THIS FOOTAGE
IS NOT RELATED TO THE ACTUAL VICTIMS

529
00:33:17,203 --> 00:33:18,913
Those girls were really pretty.

530
00:33:19,414 --> 00:33:23,209
He picked out the girls
who were born religious, like me,

531
00:33:23,292 --> 00:33:25,503
because they were pure and innocent.

532
00:33:25,586 --> 00:33:27,714
Because they'd never been touched
by a man.

533
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:32,218
After he sexually assaulted the victims,

534
00:33:32,301 --> 00:33:35,888
he gave them each
around three million won.

535
00:33:35,972 --> 00:33:40,643
People got these nice cars and houses
all of a sudden.

536
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:41,811
These were happening.

537
00:33:41,894 --> 00:33:44,897
I was like, "How on earth did they get
the money for those things?"

538
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:51,362
He gave me an envelope
that had a million won in cash.

539
00:33:51,904 --> 00:33:55,742
I used to get two or three million won.

540
00:33:57,326 --> 00:34:01,956
He wrote "five million won" in green ink
on a white envelope and gave it to me.

541
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:06,210
He gave me six million won.

542
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:08,588
It was the offerings
the church members had sowed.

543
00:34:08,671 --> 00:34:10,506
That's where he was getting this money.

544
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:12,675
He gave me two, three million won.

545
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:14,677
Up to five million won at most.

546
00:34:15,595 --> 00:34:16,721
And I gave tithe too.

547
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:21,476
There were many times
I sowed all that money back too.

548
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:23,936
I thought, "What do I do
with this precious money?"

549
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:28,191
I didn't want to waste it,
and it didn't make any sense to use it,

550
00:34:28,274 --> 00:34:29,942
so I sowed it back to the church.

551
00:34:30,026 --> 00:34:34,322
After that, their Measure of Faith
would suddenly increase within the church.

552
00:34:34,822 --> 00:34:38,159
Many Performing Arts Committee members
had really high spiritual rankings.

553
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:40,745
I think there were 20 to 30 people.

554
00:34:41,287 --> 00:34:45,416
Everything was connected,
like cogs on a wheel.

555
00:34:45,958 --> 00:34:51,047
You had to get to higher spiritual levels,
and to do so, you had to sleep with him.

556
00:34:51,547 --> 00:34:55,676
And his victims
were constantly victimized again.

557
00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:00,098
We will not give in to their demands.

558
00:35:00,181 --> 00:35:01,766
Amen!

559
00:35:01,849 --> 00:35:03,476
Dear beloved Pastor Lee!

560
00:35:03,976 --> 00:35:06,062
We're here for you!

561
00:35:06,145 --> 00:35:07,939
Be strong!

562
00:35:08,022 --> 00:35:10,983
We love you!

563
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:15,738
The pastor we've encountered
has not changed over the past decades.

564
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:18,699
He is always kind and loving.

565
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:21,119
He would cry and laugh with the members.

566
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:22,954
As we'd only seen that side of him,

567
00:35:23,037 --> 00:35:26,499
we thought, "Those women
who left were always promiscuous."

568
00:35:26,582 --> 00:35:28,960
"They've always fooled around with men."

569
00:35:29,043 --> 00:35:31,379
And that rumor spread within the church.

570
00:35:33,172 --> 00:35:38,469
"They were very immoral and dirty.
They were messy girls."

571
00:35:39,762 --> 00:35:43,349
They secretly spread this rumor,
talking about it at private gatherings.

572
00:35:46,602 --> 00:35:50,690
Many of the adults also knew the truth.

573
00:35:51,399 --> 00:35:55,194
But they didn't leave the church.

574
00:35:56,028 --> 00:35:59,323
And that was because they thought
he was the Holy Spirit.

575
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:04,620
They thought, "Humans can't pass judgment
on the Holy Spirit's actions."

576
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:09,250
Only if one or two people
had revealed the truth

577
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:12,503
and protested against what happened,

578
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:16,632
this wouldn't have lasted several decades.

579
00:36:20,136 --> 00:36:22,889
Do you admit your sexual assault charges?
Why did you do it?

580
00:36:22,972 --> 00:36:24,765
You're still not admitting the charges?

581
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:25,892
Where are we going?

582
00:36:25,975 --> 00:36:27,351
Why did you call the women?

583
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:29,770
Do you remember
the Bangbae-dong apartment?

584
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:33,316
I remember we kept asking him
questions right up to the elevator.

585
00:36:33,399 --> 00:36:37,570
But at the time,
Lee Jae-rock said nothing about himself.

586
00:36:37,653 --> 00:36:40,072
And the people around him

587
00:36:40,573 --> 00:36:43,409
were too busy just trying
to shove away the reporters.

588
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:46,287
I remember him acting very shameless.

589
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:47,330
Oh, sorry.

590
00:36:48,414 --> 00:36:50,458
Why did you call them to your room
at 10:00 p.m.?

591
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:51,876
Do you remember April 12?

592
00:36:53,669 --> 00:36:57,256
ACCUSED OF SEXUALLY ASSAULTING
CHURCH MEMBERS

593
00:36:57,340 --> 00:37:00,593
PASTOR LEE JAE-ROCK'S
SECOND POLICE SUMMONS

594
00:37:00,676 --> 00:37:03,054
After that, he continued
to deny his charges,

595
00:37:03,137 --> 00:37:05,389
even during the prosecution investigation.

596
00:37:05,473 --> 00:37:09,143
In the trial, he also denied his charges,

597
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:11,437
saying he didn't sexually assault them.

598
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:14,774
He hired very expensive lawyers

599
00:37:14,857 --> 00:37:18,236
and asserted his innocence
until the very end, but…

600
00:37:18,319 --> 00:37:21,739
There was this very major incident
that brought down Manmin.

601
00:37:21,822 --> 00:37:24,742
Back then, a file from a female member
started to circulate.

602
00:37:24,825 --> 00:37:29,121
She was one of the most active members
of the church.

603
00:37:29,205 --> 00:37:34,335
She had a voice recording of herself
calling one of her friends.

604
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:36,337
She thought there was nothing wrong

605
00:37:36,837 --> 00:37:39,715
with having sex with Lee Jae-rock,
and that it was a great honor.

606
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:45,221
Just because he's the Holy Spirit,
do you really think it's right

607
00:37:45,304 --> 00:37:48,099
for him to demand that
from unwilling women?

608
00:37:48,182 --> 00:37:50,935
-You've never thought that it was wrong?
-No.

609
00:37:51,018 --> 00:37:53,229
-So you're always completely obedient?
-Yeah.

610
00:37:54,146 --> 00:37:56,732
-It's not even that weird.
-Why isn't it weird?

611
00:37:56,816 --> 00:37:58,651
Do you have to do everything he says?

612
00:37:58,734 --> 00:38:00,695
Like if he asks women
to have sex with him?

613
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:05,032
Pastor Lee is God.
That makes everything okay.

614
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:08,202
If the Father says that it's not a sin,
then it's not a sin.

615
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:12,540
When I listened to that recording,
I realized that it was all true.

616
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:16,335
My 21 years of faith
was shattered in just two hours.

617
00:38:17,044 --> 00:38:21,382
Now, what does it feel like
when 21 years of faith shatters?

618
00:38:33,477 --> 00:38:36,147
It felt like…

619
00:38:38,107 --> 00:38:43,279
It felt like my head had gotten slammed
with a huge hammer.

620
00:38:44,071 --> 00:38:45,948
So I just couldn't think at all.

621
00:38:46,615 --> 00:38:49,577
I was so shocked
that I couldn't do anything all day.

622
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:52,872
I could've never imagined it.

623
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:57,543
You just never think
that God could do something like that.

624
00:38:57,626 --> 00:38:58,878
"What?"

625
00:38:58,961 --> 00:38:59,837
I was just…

626
00:39:01,672 --> 00:39:04,300
It felt like I had gotten hit by a bomb.

627
00:39:04,884 --> 00:39:11,265
Lee Jae-rock was more than 50 years older
than those girls.

628
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:13,893
And it's not like he didn't know them.

629
00:39:14,977 --> 00:39:16,520
These were the kids

630
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:19,523
who came to the church
on their mother's backs,

631
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:23,486
who he prayed for
while they were still toddlers.

632
00:39:23,569 --> 00:39:27,323
And he did such unspeakable things
to those children?

633
00:39:28,449 --> 00:39:31,118
At first, I almost swore at him.

634
00:39:31,827 --> 00:39:35,039
To think he'd groomed these girls
since they were in their teens,

635
00:39:35,122 --> 00:39:39,668
and did something like that
when they were barely into their twenties…

636
00:39:39,752 --> 00:39:43,255
He was over 70 years old.
I don't even know what to call him.

637
00:39:43,339 --> 00:39:45,341
A pervert? A sex addict?

638
00:39:45,966 --> 00:39:48,302
I thought about what I would do
if it were me?

639
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:51,013
What if Pastor Lee called
and told me to come to his room,

640
00:39:51,097 --> 00:39:55,893
and said, "Take off your clothes
like Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden"?

641
00:39:56,477 --> 00:39:59,939
You might find this pretty shocking,
but I would have obeyed him.

642
00:40:00,773 --> 00:40:04,819
I loved you so much.
I loved you spiritually.

643
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:08,531
The body is one thing,
but I loved you with my spirit.

644
00:40:08,614 --> 00:40:10,241
I know that.

645
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:15,621
But if you don't like the physical love,
I won't even consider it.

646
00:40:15,704 --> 00:40:16,747
Okay.

647
00:40:16,831 --> 00:40:19,083
I won't even consider it
if you don't like it.

648
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:22,128
That's not the reason why I love you.

649
00:40:23,462 --> 00:40:24,380
Okay.

650
00:40:25,172 --> 00:40:26,048
All right.

651
00:40:27,716 --> 00:40:29,427
I'll see you in the morning.

652
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:31,345
Okay, thank you.

653
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:32,346
Sure.

654
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:34,181
I love you. Bye.

655
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:35,724
Okay. Bye.

656
00:40:41,981 --> 00:40:44,692
May 3, 2018

657
00:40:45,234 --> 00:40:49,905
was the day their God had fallen.

658
00:41:00,166 --> 00:41:02,835
We're here for you! Stay strong.

659
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:07,506
MAY 3, 2018

660
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:09,091
Do you admit your charges?

661
00:41:09,758 --> 00:41:11,343
Do you still deny your charges?

662
00:41:11,844 --> 00:41:13,429
What did you mean yesterday

663
00:41:13,512 --> 00:41:16,515
when you said you don't fear
the police and prosecutors?

664
00:41:17,224 --> 00:41:20,102
Pastor Lee Jae-rock
of Manmin Central Church,

665
00:41:20,186 --> 00:41:23,481
who was accused of sexually assaulting
his followers, has been arrested.

666
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:47,922
The day that he was arrested,
it suddenly started hailing.

667
00:41:48,797 --> 00:41:50,382
"Look at that. God is angry."

668
00:41:52,009 --> 00:41:55,387
Manmin Central Church calls that day
"the Hail Incident."

669
00:41:56,180 --> 00:42:00,142
All members of the church panicked
as he was put through so much hardship.

670
00:42:00,226 --> 00:42:03,646
MANMIN CENTRAL CHURCH

671
00:42:05,064 --> 00:42:08,609
Disclose the truth! The truth!

672
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:12,738
We want the truth!

673
00:42:12,821 --> 00:42:16,742
PASTOR LEE WAS FRAMED

674
00:42:18,744 --> 00:42:22,331
BRING OUT THE LIE DETECTOR

675
00:42:22,414 --> 00:42:23,916
TRANSPORT

676
00:42:25,459 --> 00:42:26,669
At the front?

677
00:42:27,461 --> 00:42:28,546
He's at the very front.

678
00:42:29,505 --> 00:42:30,673
Number 3114?

679
00:42:30,756 --> 00:42:32,633
For many people, it was the first time

680
00:42:32,716 --> 00:42:35,553
seeing him with white hair,
looking like a coward.

681
00:42:35,636 --> 00:42:36,971
He was taking short steps,

682
00:42:38,097 --> 00:42:41,308
as he was getting out of the vehicle.
He looked all timid to me.

683
00:42:42,142 --> 00:42:45,521
They said because Jae-rock is God,
he doesn't get white hair,

684
00:42:45,604 --> 00:42:48,524
that his hair will be black
even though he's really old.

685
00:42:52,778 --> 00:42:54,905
But he just looked like a regular old man.

686
00:43:00,953 --> 00:43:07,918
DEFENDANT LEE JAE-ROCK
SENTENCED TO 16 YEARS IN JAIL

687
00:43:10,462 --> 00:43:13,549
All right, everyone.
Let's keep that in our hearts

688
00:43:13,632 --> 00:43:16,677
as we wish Pastor Lee a happy new year.

689
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:19,179
Let's say "Happy New Year" and bow.

690
00:43:19,263 --> 00:43:22,808
Happy New Year.

691
00:43:24,977 --> 00:43:28,564
SOME MANMIN CENTRAL CHURCH MEMBERS
ARE STILL WAITING FOR PASTOR LEE JAE-ROCK

692
00:43:28,647 --> 00:43:32,234
Pastor Lee!

693
00:43:32,318 --> 00:43:35,738
We miss you!

694
00:43:35,821 --> 00:43:37,823
Come back to us soon.

695
00:43:39,533 --> 00:43:41,994
I am currently
at Seoul Nambu Detention Center,

696
00:43:42,077 --> 00:43:45,164
as the Director
of the Council of Corrections.

697
00:43:45,247 --> 00:43:46,832
I have quite a lot of authority

698
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:49,501
in the detention center.

699
00:43:52,755 --> 00:43:57,509
I visited Daegu Detention Center
in March 2021.

700
00:43:59,803 --> 00:44:01,722
I was curious

701
00:44:01,805 --> 00:44:06,018
how the man who deceived us was doing.

702
00:44:08,270 --> 00:44:10,814
I could see him,
so I said, "Hey, Lee Jae-rock!"

703
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:13,442
And he looked at me, but…

704
00:44:14,276 --> 00:44:18,280
Imagine how hard my heart was pounding
when I called out his name.

705
00:44:21,742 --> 00:44:24,953
"You should be ashamed!
Aren't you scared of God?"

706
00:44:25,037 --> 00:44:27,331
That's what I wanted to tell him, but…

707
00:44:30,167 --> 00:44:31,418
He didn't recognize me.

708
00:44:33,253 --> 00:44:36,006
And even in prison,
he was the leader of his cell.

709
00:44:36,882 --> 00:44:39,885
He always has five million won
kept in custody, which is the limit.

710
00:44:40,552 --> 00:44:43,472
He's living a good life.

711
