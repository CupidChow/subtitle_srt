1
00:00:15,765 --> 00:00:19,602
On the 8th of last month, the prosecution
and police began the investigation.

2
00:00:20,103 --> 00:00:22,981
Upon receiving a report
that three followers had been murdered,

3
00:00:23,064 --> 00:00:25,233
the authorities dispatched
about 50 detectives

4
00:00:25,316 --> 00:00:28,278
to the Baby Garden
to arrest the cult leader, Kim Ki-soon.

5
00:00:29,779 --> 00:00:33,491
At the time, we were at a church service.

6
00:00:33,575 --> 00:00:36,453
It was the place we always held services.
It was huge.

7
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:41,124
Somebody said
that there were tons of people outside.

8
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,044
He said we were completely surrounded.

9
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:47,630
On the weekdays,
the Baby Garden members go to work.

10
00:00:48,506 --> 00:00:51,968
Then they all come back together
on Sunday evening

11
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:54,929
to listen to Kim Ki-soon's sermons.

12
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:59,476
Because there were so many people
who had beaten up the victims,

13
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:04,689
it was the best time to ensure
that we captured them all at once.

14
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:08,026
Along with dozens of investigators

15
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:09,986
and dispatched police officers,

16
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:12,489
I was also on the scene.

17
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:14,491
It was a very cold day.

18
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:19,496
The prosecutors were trying to get in

19
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:21,498
through the doors here and there,

20
00:01:22,373 --> 00:01:24,876
and people were trying to stop them
from coming in.

21
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:27,670
There were people fighting
at every single door.

22
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:31,841
I mean, they were running around
like wild animals.

23
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:35,470
I remember that one of our investigators

24
00:01:35,553 --> 00:01:39,808
was thrown up in the air
and out the door.

25
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:44,771
That's how strong their resistance was.

26
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:49,943
I'm the one who helped Kim Ki-soon escape.

27
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:56,699
I thought, "Huh? What's going on?"

28
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:58,535
It was pretty serious.

29
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:01,913
So I went, "What's going on?"
Then I stopped to think for a moment.

30
00:02:01,996 --> 00:02:03,623
I realized

31
00:02:04,415 --> 00:02:07,794
that they were probably going to take
the leader, Kim Ki-soon, away.

32
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:12,090
So I started looking to see
if I could find a door to exit.

33
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:15,969
We had this passageway
that led underground.

34
00:02:16,052 --> 00:02:19,013
There was nobody there
when we went down.

35
00:02:19,597 --> 00:02:20,431
So…

36
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:23,476
I got her to escape.

37
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:30,733
In the middle of all that,
Kim Ki-soon got away from us.

38
00:02:48,626 --> 00:02:52,589
IN THE NAME OF GOD: A HOLY BETRAYAL

39
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:59,554
THE BABY GARDEN OF DEATH

40
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:04,684
KANG MIN-KOO

41
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:06,686
My name is Kang Min-koo. I'm a lawyer.

42
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:10,023
At the time, I was a chief prosecutor
at the Yeoju branch

43
00:03:10,106 --> 00:03:11,691
of the Suwon Prosecutors' Office.

44
00:03:11,774 --> 00:03:12,859
PROSECUTOR KANG MIN-KOO

45
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:18,406
This is how they tied up Choi Nak-gwi
and dragged him to the pigpen.

46
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:21,075
We're seeing
which of the victims' accounts

47
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:25,079
were actually possible in this scene
and how it could've played out.

48
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:30,043
At first, I was thinking,
"Come on, this can't be real."

49
00:03:30,126 --> 00:03:33,546
That's how shocking it was.

50
00:03:34,797 --> 00:03:37,342
WE WERE DRAGGED TO THE LEADER'S ROOM,
STRIPPED, BEATEN

51
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:39,135
WITH MULBERRY WOOD AND METAL PIPES

52
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:41,804
I SAW KANG MI-GYEONG
GETTING BEATEN INDISCRIMINATELY TO DEATH

53
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:44,390
IN THE STORAGE ROOM C-0
WITH WOODEN STICKS, UNDER KI-SOON'S ORDER

54
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:49,145
I THOUGHT I WOULD ALSO GET BEATEN TO DEATH
IF I STAYED THERE

55
00:03:49,854 --> 00:03:54,234
After two or three murders
came into the spotlight,

56
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:59,364
previous members of the Baby Garden
were disgusted by them and decided

57
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:02,700
to report Kim Ki-soon.
So, they filed a petition against her.

58
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:06,371
I thought it was worth investigating,

59
00:04:06,454 --> 00:04:08,539
so I started looking into it.

60
00:04:09,165 --> 00:04:13,336
The part that stood out to me the most

61
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:20,551
was the description of the death
of a child named Choi Nak-gwi.

62
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:23,471
He was seven years old when he died.

63
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:28,268
The petition was received
about ten years after his death.

64
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:32,522
It was written by the child's father.

65
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:35,275
PETITION

66
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:37,568
THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG WITH THIS PLACE

67
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:39,070
CHOI MYEONG-HO

68
00:04:39,153 --> 00:04:41,197
My name is Choi Myeong-ho.

69
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:45,118
I'm the father of Choi Nak-gwi,
the boy who died in the Baby Garden.

70
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:49,998
I think I did that
because I was so desperate.

71
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:52,458
Because if I hadn't stepped forward,

72
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:55,712
they wouldn't have been able
to settle that case.

73
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:59,465
Was there any other way? We thought
we had to take legal action against her

74
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:02,051
to let the world know
and bring her to justice.

75
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:05,471
People who agreed on that
worked together to sue her.

76
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:09,767
DECEMBER 8, 1996

77
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:15,690
THE BABY GARDEN
COOPERATION TOWN

78
00:05:15,773 --> 00:05:18,860
The investigation was swift
under the order of the chief.

79
00:05:18,943 --> 00:05:22,155
The main target, Mr. Kim Dong-hui,
who was summoned by the prosecution,

80
00:05:22,238 --> 00:05:24,240
was taken straight from his bed.

81
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:32,165
We were shocked when we entered that room
because there was this huge safe.

82
00:05:32,248 --> 00:05:34,834
It was full of money. 

83
00:05:34,917 --> 00:05:36,794
It was more than 700 million won.

84
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:38,796
Back then, 50,000-won bills didn't exist.

85
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,800
So 700 million was a lot of cash
in 10,000-won bills.

86
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:48,639
And the cash back then would be worth
about two to three billion won now.

87
00:05:49,265 --> 00:05:52,226
The place where Kim Ki-soon lived,

88
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:54,479
with a bit of exaggeration,
was like a palace.

89
00:05:55,396 --> 00:05:57,023
She had her personal sauna,

90
00:05:57,982 --> 00:06:01,444
and she had a bed made of clay
at the time.

91
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:03,071
It was very big.

92
00:06:03,571 --> 00:06:06,824
In contrast, her followers' rooms

93
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:09,952
felt a bit like military barracks.
That's how it felt.

94
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:11,871
So there was a big contrast.

95
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:18,461
When you went into Kim Ki-soon's room,

96
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:20,838
it was very comfortable,
like it was heaven.

97
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:25,718
I think the sound system in her room
was worth at least 100 million won.

98
00:06:26,302 --> 00:06:29,305
Some of her things
were extremely expensive at the time.

99
00:06:33,142 --> 00:06:34,644
KIM KI-SOON WANTED FOR MURDER

100
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:36,062
HOMICIDE, CONFINEMENT, FRAUD, ETC.

101
00:06:37,438 --> 00:06:40,775
Because we lost the queen bee,

102
00:06:40,858 --> 00:06:44,445
I thought that the search and seizure
was a complete failure.

103
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:46,739
I felt a huge sense of shame.

104
00:06:48,032 --> 00:06:50,368
Of course, we put her on the wanted list.

105
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:52,829
We also tried to track down her vehicle.

106
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:54,622
We also tried many other things.

107
00:07:00,044 --> 00:07:02,630
We exposed Kim Ki-soon's face
to the media.

108
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:05,716
We also tried
to receive reports from the public.

109
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:10,012
But Kim Ki-soon was not a stupid woman.

110
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:11,681
So she stayed well hidden.

111
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:13,474
It was really frustrating.

112
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:15,893
I was like,
"You can't even catch her?"

113
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:19,147
Surely, they should've gotten her.

114
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:23,276
But the police couldn't find her,
so they seemed a bit pathetic to me.

115
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:26,571
It was obvious where she went.

116
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,240
Where is Ms. Kim hiding then?

117
00:07:30,032 --> 00:07:35,455
At the time, the previous members
told us the truth about what happened.

118
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:39,625
But the people who were still there
did everything to protect Kim Ki-soon.

119
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:42,378
Though everyone else
might point fingers at her,

120
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:45,381
Agaya is still the God of the Baby Garden.

121
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,967
I don't know the specific details
at the moment.

122
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:50,511
I don't know where she is right now.

123
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:52,972
About your leader, Kim Ki-soon.

124
00:07:53,055 --> 00:07:55,349
There is no leader. No leader here.

125
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:59,228
No leader. This is a cooperative farm.
You don't know what you're talking about.

126
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:02,190
She's not a leader.
She just gives us guidance.

127
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:05,151
Because she's so smart,
she simply guides us, so to speak.

128
00:08:05,234 --> 00:08:09,113
So, in a way, she was like a friend
and sister, younger or older.

129
00:08:09,947 --> 00:08:11,199
Where is she right now?

130
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:13,451
She went somewhere.

131
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:18,539
Of course, I'm satisfied.
I'm content and happy.

132
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:22,001
It might be a bit noisy
around here for now

133
00:08:22,084 --> 00:08:24,504
as some people raided the place.

134
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:28,424
People who left call themselves victims,
but they never suffered any damage.

135
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:30,426
They got a lot of help here, actually.

136
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,178
It's different from the truth.

137
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:35,014
We are not swayed by something like that.

138
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:38,100
No one who lived here left the place

139
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:40,269
because they weren't swayed
by the incident.

140
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:45,024
Come on, wake up,
or you'll suffer for another 15 years.

141
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:47,818
Our hard work is worth it.

142
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:48,945
How is it worth it?

143
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:51,113
You left us, so don't bother us!

144
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:59,789
I think they were blindly loyal to her,

145
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:04,001
just like it is instinctive
for bees to protect their queen.

146
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:07,630
We'll answer to Agaya only, forever…

147
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:12,468
This case revolves around three members
who were killed and buried.

148
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:17,473
But regarding this, the prosecution
has not found any conclusive evidence.

149
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:21,018
The only answer was to secure the corpses.

150
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:23,813
But one had been cremated
and another was missing.

151
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:31,070
Trying to find the truth in a case
where there were no bodies

152
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:34,031
was a very difficult process
in my opinion.

153
00:09:36,325 --> 00:09:38,119
1978
THE RISE OF KIM KI-SOON

154
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:44,500
1987
THE GARDEN OF DEATH

155
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:48,170
The leader, Kim Ki-soon,
established a cult religion here

156
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:51,591
and indiscriminately beat her followers
who did not obey her.

157
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:54,343
"THE UTOPIA OF DEATH" OF VANITY

158
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:57,305
STRIPPED NAKED AND BEATEN
AFTER GETTING CAUGHT TRYING TO ESCAPE

159
00:09:57,388 --> 00:09:59,849
BRUISES COVERED THE ENTIRE BODY,
AND EVEN TOENAILS FELL OUT

160
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:03,936
Including the Choi Nak-gwi case,
several other people also died.

161
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,771
They all died.

162
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:10,026
Yoon Yong-ung, Seo Jong-won,
Nak-gwi, and Mi-gyeong.

163
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:16,741
But the causes of the deaths were unknown.
We have no idea how they died.

164
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:25,333
YOON YONG-UNG, 44 YEARS OLD
DIED ON JANUARY 2, 1988

165
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:28,794
It was January 1, 1988.

166
00:10:29,545 --> 00:10:31,464
While I was getting ready for a play,

167
00:10:32,214 --> 00:10:35,760
Kim Ki-soon called me,
so I went to her room.

168
00:10:35,843 --> 00:10:40,890
She held my hands and said,
"You can live without your dad, right?"

169
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:44,185
She told me my father had died
after drinking pesticide

170
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:47,855
and said I should live with her forever.

171
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:52,568
I wasn't even allowed to look
at my father's corpse.

172
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:57,198
I didn't know anything else
except that my father had passed away.

173
00:11:00,284 --> 00:11:04,997
KANG MI-GYEONG, 21 YEARS OLD
DIED ON NOVEMBER 20, 1988

174
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:10,878
Mi-gyeong was really pretty.

175
00:11:10,961 --> 00:11:13,673
She would always smile a lot and be kind.

176
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:17,468
Everyone liked her.

177
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:19,470
She was pretty, really.

178
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:25,017
She was exceptionally pretty,
unlike the rest of us.

179
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:26,811
She was also very gentle.

180
00:11:28,604 --> 00:11:30,356
Kim Ki-soon has three sons.

181
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:41,617
Because Mi-gyeong was so pretty,
one of them had a crush on Mi-gyeong.

182
00:11:43,327 --> 00:11:45,496
So he had his eyes on Mi-gyeong.

183
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:51,877
Kang Mi-gyeong used to go
to Kim Ki-soon's house in Muk-dong

184
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:55,089
and cook and wash the dishes for her.

185
00:11:55,172 --> 00:11:56,632
She was always in and out.

186
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:03,472
That's why he asked his mother
to keep Mi-gyeong there

187
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:05,057
as a housekeeper of sorts.

188
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:08,769
Kim Ki-soon's son.

189
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:12,398
Kim Ki-soon's son
was the one who liked her,

190
00:12:12,481 --> 00:12:13,858
not the other way around.

191
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:16,944
Kim Ki-soon found out about it,

192
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:20,281
and she figured
it would be a huge controversy

193
00:12:20,364 --> 00:12:22,908
if the members heard about it.

194
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:25,035
So she tried to cover for her son

195
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:27,121
by saying, "My son would never do that."

196
00:12:27,204 --> 00:12:31,709
She said, "Mi-gyeong,
you seduced my son, so it's your fault."

197
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:34,378
And she said Mi-gyeong had to be punished.

198
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:37,798
I heard she made
Mi-gyeong's parents beat her first.

199
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:39,800
So Mi-gyeong's mother beat her first,

200
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:43,888
and all these other people
started hitting her with sticks.

201
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:55,399
I went there after eating dinner
and working at the chicken coop.

202
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:58,861
Everybody was talking,
standing around Agaya,

203
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:00,780
while Kang Mi-gyeong was kneeling down.

204
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:03,908
And some people
were standing there with bats.

205
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:10,414
At that moment,
one of the people with bats looked at me

206
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:13,417
and yelled at me to sit next to Mi-gyeong.

207
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:19,548
They looked at us, kneeling side by side,
and said, "You bitches are both the same."

208
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:22,510
"The two of you broke Agaya's heart,

209
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:27,848
so we can kill you both and make sure
nobody will ever find your bodies."

210
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:38,943
At that moment, after Mi-gyeong
received a few blows from her mother,

211
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:42,947
she lifted her head
and looked up at Agaya.

212
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:49,411
Kim Ki-soon called her a cheeky bitch
and ordered people to kill her.

213
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:51,872
Then people started to beat her.

214
00:13:55,626 --> 00:14:00,798
It was like a scene
of chaos and clamor from hell itself.

215
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:06,720
My mind went blank
as I watched so many people taking turns

216
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:11,475
and beating such a small and weak girl
while cussing at her.

217
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:16,397
I was so terrified
and thought I might actually die there.

218
00:14:18,482 --> 00:14:22,862
I'm the one
who had to clean those factories.

219
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:25,614
As I was cleaning,

220
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:28,325
I heard Mi-gyeong screaming for help.

221
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:31,120
FORMER MEMBER OF THE BABY GARDEN
WITNESS OF THE KANG MI-GYEONG INCIDENT

222
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:41,088
Later, she was so exhausted
that she couldn't even cry or scream.

223
00:14:44,758 --> 00:14:47,887
Mi-gyeong ended up passing out.

224
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:53,350
Then, Kim Ki-soon left,
and the others followed her out.

225
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:57,938
The few people who stayed around
told me to clean everything up.

226
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:05,446
That night, I didn't get any sleep.

227
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:10,117
I just hid there, completely quiet,
then ran away from there in the morning.

228
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:17,291
They went quiet,
so I was wondering what happened.

229
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:23,547
Then I found all those loud
and violent women leaving one by one.

230
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:28,886
I looked and saw
that they had completely undressed her,

231
00:15:29,553 --> 00:15:33,807
and they put her
in these loose work clothes instead.

232
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:40,064
She was lying on the ground,
and she had peed everywhere.

233
00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:42,733
Then she looked at me,

234
00:15:43,525 --> 00:15:46,195
and I saw her struggling
to tell me something.

235
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:52,076
I think she was asking for help
or asking for me to hide her somewhere.

236
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:54,662
She still hadn't died yet.

237
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:58,707
I quickly ran away and hid somewhere else.

238
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:01,043
Then this woman, Kim something,

239
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:07,925
came in holding a large broom upside down.

240
00:16:08,008 --> 00:16:12,972
And she beat that dying girl to death.

241
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:27,820
CHOI NAK-GWI, FIVE YEARS OLD
DIED ON AUGUST 14, 1987

242
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:29,154
He just missed his mother,

243
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:32,992
but he wasn't allowed to see me,
and he didn't know how to express it.

244
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:35,577
So he pooped
and smeared it on the window frames.

245
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:39,123
He got frustrated and said
that he hates Kim Ki-soon.

246
00:16:39,206 --> 00:16:42,209
Whenever he saw her,
he got so scared and started yelling.

247
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:47,256
She said, "A demon that defies Agaya
has possessed him."

248
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:49,883
He was possessed
by an evil spirit that would harm her,

249
00:16:50,592 --> 00:16:52,970
so she insisted
that we get rid of the child.

250
00:16:53,595 --> 00:16:54,680
It was a place

251
00:16:54,763 --> 00:16:58,017
where if she told us to kill a person,
then we had to do it.

252
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:02,688
If she told us to go beat somebody up,
we had to all go and do it.

253
00:17:02,771 --> 00:17:05,315
We have to obey
whatever she ordered us to do.

254
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:11,238
What the leader said was the truth,
and the only truth.

255
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:18,620
You know the people who died,
like Choi Nak-gwi and Kang Mi-gyeong?

256
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:23,000
When she was punishing them,
she made it so the parents didn't think,

257
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:25,085
"Why is she hitting my daughter?"

258
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:26,795
That made the punishments possible.

259
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:33,635
Mr. Kang was a pastor before he joined.
Even though his daughter had died,

260
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:37,389
he did nothing about her death
because he had been brainwashed.

261
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:39,266
He didn't do anything to resist.

262
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:42,478
You could say
she disarmed those people psychologically.

263
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:44,897
Through brainwashing.
It was something very scary.

264
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,815
Kim Ki-soon told me to come and see her.

265
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:50,819
AUGUST 15, 1987

266
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:54,865
She said, "Nak-gwi is gone. He's dead."

267
00:17:55,699 --> 00:17:57,409
"Everything is settled already."

268
00:17:57,493 --> 00:17:59,244
"You just have to do as told."

269
00:17:59,953 --> 00:18:04,208
I went to the director
of a Christian clinic in Sanggye-dong.

270
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:06,502
CHOI NAK-GWI'S ACTUAL DEATH CERTIFICATE

271
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:07,628
AUGUST 14, 1987
9:30 P.M.

272
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:08,921
HAGYE-DONG, DOBONG-GU, SEOUL

273
00:18:09,004 --> 00:18:11,215
They told me,
"You just need to sign here."

274
00:18:14,676 --> 00:18:18,931
The doctor had the paper
filled out already and said,

275
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:22,351
"Nak-gwi died
from a myocardial infarction."

276
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:25,854
"Nak-gwi definitely died
from a myocardial infarction."

277
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:28,524
DIRECT CAUSE OF DEATH:
CARDIOPULMONARY ARREST

278
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:30,818
And did you sign it?

279
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:33,862
I signed it.

280
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:38,867
Even though my child was beaten to death,
I signed a document

281
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:41,620
that said he died
from a myocardial infarction.

282
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:49,461
I went to the community office
to report his death afterwards.

283
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:55,884
But the worker at the office
looked a bit confused.

284
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:59,721
She asked if I was really Nak-gwi's mom,
and if he really died.

285
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,392
I said, "Yes, that is right."

286
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:08,063
Seeing her confused face,

287
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:12,276
I realized that a true mother
should be torn up about her child's death.

288
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:16,238
But I didn't show such emotions,
so she probably thought I was strange.

289
00:19:21,034 --> 00:19:24,454
From my memory, it was a season
when it was pouring with rain.

290
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:28,876
I saw that Yoon Bang-su
tied up a wardrobe

291
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:32,588
with some strings
and loaded it in the back of his truck.

292
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:35,841
He said, "Nak-gwi's body is in there."

293
00:19:35,924 --> 00:19:37,801
That's what he told me.

294
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:41,138
"You need to follow Yoon Bang-su."

295
00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:45,184
"If you go with him and cremate the body,

296
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:47,477
you won't have to worry
about anything else."

297
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:49,229
That's what Kim Ki-soon said.

298
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:06,371
I waited for my turn,
and when it was my turn,

299
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:10,292
they said they put his body in there.
So I was waiting for his ashes,

300
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:14,546
but Yoon Bang-su said we had to leave
because we were told to hurry back.

301
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:19,051
So I left without even seeing his ashes.

302
00:20:22,095 --> 00:20:23,680
But I couldn't even cry.

303
00:20:27,434 --> 00:20:30,103
1987
THE GARDEN OF DEATH

304
00:20:32,814 --> 00:20:37,361
1996
KIM KI-SOON'S ESCAPE

305
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:41,240
This is breaking news
about a cult called the Baby Garden.

306
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:43,867
The leader, Kim,
must be found to solve the case.

307
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:47,371
The investigation started a week ago,
but there has been no progress.

308
00:20:47,454 --> 00:20:49,122
The prosecution is becoming nervous.

309
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:52,125
To unveil the truth about the Baby Garden,

310
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:55,587
the prosecutors consider the arrest
of Kim Ki-soon their top priority.

311
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:58,382
They are putting all of their resources
toward her arrest.

312
00:20:58,465 --> 00:21:00,509
Though the investigation
started a week ago,

313
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:02,803
her whereabouts are still unknown.

314
00:21:02,886 --> 00:21:06,598
At the time, the media
were criticizing all the prosecutors.

315
00:21:07,182 --> 00:21:10,227
We had basically let her escape.

316
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:13,063
Thanks to that,
she bought herself some time.

317
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:18,986
I think we gave her enough time to come up
with an elaborate countermeasure.

318
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:26,285
I went to see a famous lawyer
who I found through my acquaintances.

319
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:35,085
At the time, Lee Soon-bok
was Kim Ki-soon's right-hand woman.

320
00:21:35,168 --> 00:21:39,214
She wasn't very old,
but she was quite intelligent.

321
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:43,677
Back then, as Kim Ki-soon's advisor,

322
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:48,098
she was in charge of handling
the whole situation.

323
00:21:48,181 --> 00:21:52,936
She was a woman
with high skills and abilities.

324
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:57,149
Kim Ki-soon was in a tough spot,
and so were we.

325
00:21:57,232 --> 00:22:00,819
And we had really put our lives
on the line, in a way,

326
00:22:00,902 --> 00:22:03,530
to achieve all of those things.

327
00:22:03,613 --> 00:22:05,615
We couldn't just let that fall apart.

328
00:22:06,116 --> 00:22:07,034
BURIED SECRETLY

329
00:22:07,534 --> 00:22:11,246
A man named Yoon Bang-su
was the key to solving the case.

330
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:13,623
And that's because he was the one

331
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:16,460
who took care of Choi Nak-gwi
and Kang Mi-gyeong's bodies.

332
00:22:16,543 --> 00:22:18,837
Eventually, he started to speak out.

333
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:21,923
Prosecutors suspect that Yoon Bang-su,

334
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:24,926
who was an excavator driver
at the Baby Garden in 1987,

335
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:28,889
was the one who disposed
of Choi Nak-gwi and others' dead bodies.

336
00:22:29,389 --> 00:22:32,351
Excavators are needed to dig the ground
to bury the corpses.

337
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:34,770
So as far as we know,
he was directly involved.

338
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:38,648
Currently, we're focusing
on interrogating him.

339
00:22:38,732 --> 00:22:41,777
So we summoned Yoon Bang-su.

340
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:45,781
He was a large man, quite muscular.

341
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:49,326
He looked like a simple and honest man,
and he was tall too.

342
00:22:49,826 --> 00:22:53,705
But despite his looks, he was quite shy.

343
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:57,376
He was a bit introverted from my memory.

344
00:22:59,252 --> 00:23:03,048
At first, he denied it.
He said he didn't bury the bodies.

345
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:08,929
But he had known Kang Mi-gyeong
since she was a child,

346
00:23:09,012 --> 00:23:13,934
so I persistently used that relationship
to persuade him.

347
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:17,771
"You knew Kang Mi-gyeong
since she was a child."

348
00:23:17,854 --> 00:23:20,524
"Don't you feel bad for her
who died unfairly?"

349
00:23:20,607 --> 00:23:23,360
"Don't you think
you should tell the truth?"

350
00:23:28,865 --> 00:23:33,120
Later, Yoon Bang-su ended up coming clean.

351
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:41,586
"I CARRIED MS. KANG'S BODY
IN MY ARMS AND BURIED HER"

352
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:46,007
"I'M THE ONE
WHO BURIED KANG MI-GYEONG'S CORPSE"

353
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:49,386
People like Yoon Bang-su were used

354
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:52,931
to move the bodies and bury them.

355
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:54,683
And after that…

356
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:56,268
-Collapse.
-Curl up on the ground.

357
00:23:56,351 --> 00:23:58,937
-Stay still.
-Move your body like before…

358
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:01,773
Film him as he walks out of there.
Okay, walk out. Good.

359
00:24:08,989 --> 00:24:10,866
Do it naturally, like you did before.

360
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:20,542
DECEMBER 20, 1996
THE EXCAVATION OF THE BODIES BEGINS

361
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:36,725
Yoon, the excavator driver,

362
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:39,936
came to the scene
on the third day of excavating bodies.

363
00:24:40,854 --> 00:24:44,649
Yoon said he was the one
who buried Kang Mi-gyeong's body in 1988

364
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:46,568
and described the situation at the time.

365
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:49,070
Where did you get the body,
and where did you bury it?

366
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:52,866
I got the body from the company room,
brought it here, and…

367
00:24:52,949 --> 00:24:54,159
YOON BANG-SU

368
00:24:54,242 --> 00:24:55,160
…buried it here.

369
00:24:55,243 --> 00:24:57,954
-You see that drainpipe right there?
-Yeah.

370
00:24:58,038 --> 00:25:02,250
Considering the location of that pipe,
I'm pretty sure this is the right place.

371
00:25:04,961 --> 00:25:06,838
Yoon Bang-su said that

372
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:10,717
Kim Ki-soon had called him over
and given him the orders directly.

373
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:13,762
"I beat her a few times, and she died.
So go bury her."

374
00:25:21,436 --> 00:25:23,855
So he said he took Kang Mi-gyeong's body,

375
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:27,275
dug a hole with an excavator,
and buried it.

376
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:30,362
He said he cried a lot
before burying her body.

377
00:25:30,445 --> 00:25:32,906
He even told us something
as detailed as this.

378
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:37,244
So we were certain
that we would find Kang Mi-gyeong's body.

379
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:38,912
At the time,

380
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:44,084
much of the media was competing
against each other to report on this case.

381
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:47,212
We brought an excavator to every location

382
00:25:47,295 --> 00:25:49,130
that Yoon Bang-su pointed out

383
00:25:50,173 --> 00:25:51,550
and dug into the ground.

384
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:54,844
Kim Ki-soon said,
"Dig all you want, then."

385
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:57,430
She knew it wasn't there.

386
00:25:57,514 --> 00:26:00,350
Though we didn't know,
I think she knew where it was.

387
00:26:04,354 --> 00:26:06,356
Unfortunately, the body was never found.

388
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,902
Today, the prosecution again
summoned the excavator driver,

389
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:13,905
who supposedly buried Kang's body,
to excavate the body,

390
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:15,740
but they were unable to find the body.

391
00:26:15,824 --> 00:26:17,784
We were almost going insane.

392
00:26:17,867 --> 00:26:20,662
I mean, finding the body
was the only solution.

393
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:22,831
But we failed to do that too.

394
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:26,626
It was a big disadvantage
for the prosecution.

395
00:26:41,182 --> 00:26:43,727

KIM KI-SOON'S ESCAPE

DECEMBER 1996
KIM KI-SOON TURNS HERSELF IN

397
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:54,571
The prosecution revealed
that the cult leader, Kim,

398
00:26:54,654 --> 00:26:56,823
had called them in the morning to say

399
00:26:56,906 --> 00:27:00,160
she would turn herself in
between 5:30 and 6:00 this afternoon.

400
00:27:00,243 --> 00:27:03,663
Two lawyers came
to the branch chief's office.

401
00:27:03,747 --> 00:27:06,166
"Kim Ki-soon will turn herself in soon."

402
00:27:06,249 --> 00:27:08,627
DECEMBER 16, 1996
SUWON DISTRICT COURT IN YEOJU

403
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:09,711
Hey!

404
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:11,171
Move!

405
00:27:11,254 --> 00:27:13,173
-Out of the way, man!
-Everyone, move!

406
00:27:13,256 --> 00:27:14,257
Move, you asshole!

407
00:27:14,341 --> 00:27:15,508
In the front, move! 

408
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:16,426
One in the front!

409
00:27:16,509 --> 00:27:18,053
-You in the front, move!
-Move!

410
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:19,512
Check the audio.

411
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:25,894
You in the front! Move! In the front!

412
00:27:27,228 --> 00:27:28,897
Move!

413
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:31,358
Enough! Come this way. Go!

414
00:27:35,612 --> 00:27:37,280
Why are you in front of me?

415
00:27:37,364 --> 00:27:38,490
Damn it. Hey, move!

416
00:27:38,573 --> 00:27:41,159
Do you admit it's a religious group?

417
00:27:41,242 --> 00:27:43,828
-Ms. Kim.
-Why were you summoned by the prosecution?

418
00:27:44,454 --> 00:27:46,081
Are you really Kim Ki-soon?

419
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:46,998
Are you?

420
00:27:50,293 --> 00:27:52,545
I thought,
"Now we're really getting started."

421
00:27:52,629 --> 00:27:57,801
She was dressed
like an ordinary middle-aged woman.

422
00:27:57,884 --> 00:28:00,804
She wasn't wearing any fancy clothes.

423
00:28:00,887 --> 00:28:02,889
The impression I got was

424
00:28:02,972 --> 00:28:06,893
that she was dressed a lot more humbly
than I thought.

425
00:28:06,976 --> 00:28:09,104
When those two lawyers came to us,

426
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:12,315
they said Kim Ki-soon
would be released within three days

427
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:15,735
if she went there,
and she should go without worrying.

428
00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:19,322
So Kim Ki-soon also thought,
"Oh, so I'll be free in three days."

429
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:24,202
We thought she'd be out
after the interrogation, but she wasn't.

430
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:29,541
Kim Ki-soon came at 5:45 this afternoon,
and the prosecution arrested her

431
00:28:29,624 --> 00:28:34,170
on the spot for homicide
and abandonment of dead bodies.

432
00:28:34,254 --> 00:28:37,424
It just kept getting bigger and bigger.
The case became huge.

433
00:28:37,507 --> 00:28:41,261
All the news was covering her story,
and it was everywhere.

434
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:47,058
All the newspapers were blowing up.
So I thought, "Wow, this is no joke."

435
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:53,231
I interrogated her myself
and almost stayed up all night that day.

436
00:28:53,314 --> 00:28:56,985
But she was a lot calmer than I expected.

437
00:28:57,068 --> 00:29:00,530
She stayed composed
while saying what she wanted to say.

438
00:29:00,613 --> 00:29:02,115
She never swayed emotionally.

439
00:29:02,198 --> 00:29:04,492
Although I tried to actually provoke her

440
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:06,411
by asking some leading questions,

441
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:09,414
she didn't fall for them.

442
00:29:09,497 --> 00:29:11,958
So I could tell
that she was pretty experienced.

443
00:29:12,041 --> 00:29:15,712
The Baby Garden's leader, Kim,
has strongly denied all allegations

444
00:29:15,795 --> 00:29:18,214
in the interrogation,
including murders of followers.

445
00:29:18,298 --> 00:29:19,674
She denied them all.

446
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:21,551
She denied everything

447
00:29:21,634 --> 00:29:23,887
and said she never
ordered anything like that.

448
00:29:25,138 --> 00:29:28,224
She said,
"I don't know what you're talking about."

449
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:31,895
"Those violent people
were trying to punish the victims."

450
00:29:31,978 --> 00:29:34,481
"But I never knew what was happening."

451
00:29:34,564 --> 00:29:37,442
The first trial
of the Baby Garden's leader, Kim Ki-soon,

452
00:29:37,525 --> 00:29:40,445
and 11 others took place today
at Suwon District Court in Yeoju.

453
00:29:40,528 --> 00:29:42,530
During today's trial,
Leader Kim Ki-soon said

454
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:46,409
that she was never the spiritual leader
of the Baby Garden.

455
00:29:46,493 --> 00:29:48,787
She also denied all allegations,

456
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:51,498
saying Choi Nak-gwi, who died in 1987,

457
00:29:51,581 --> 00:29:53,583
had never even lived in the Baby Garden.

DECEMBER 1996
KIM KI-SOON TURNS HERSELF IN

459
00:29:59,589 --> 00:30:04,385
JANUARY 1997
YOON BANG-SU CHANGES HIS STATEMENT

460
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:08,932
The key witness, who testified
that he buried the Baby Garden members,

461
00:30:09,015 --> 00:30:12,769
told the court that all of his testimony
during the prosecution was false.

462
00:30:12,852 --> 00:30:15,063
Yoon said he made a false statement

463
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:17,190
due to the prosecution's threats
and assault.

464
00:30:18,608 --> 00:30:20,777
It was devastatingly sad news.

465
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:23,822
When Yoon Bang-su came to see me,

466
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:26,908
he said,
"What if the Baby Garden falls apart,

467
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:29,619
and Kim Ki-soon is never released?
What do we do then?"

468
00:30:29,702 --> 00:30:31,454
"Where are we supposed to live?"

469
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:35,375
So I told him, "Just take it back,
and say you didn't bury them."

470
00:30:38,294 --> 00:30:42,882
At that point,
the testimony of Yoon Bang-su

471
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:46,052
had completely lost credibility.

472
00:30:46,135 --> 00:30:52,350
Yoon Bang-su gave us the most trouble
during that investigation.

473
00:30:52,433 --> 00:30:54,060
THE FOLLOWING RECORDING IS A PHONE CALL

474
00:30:54,143 --> 00:30:56,396
BETWEEN YOON BANG-SU
AND A CREW MEMBER ON MAY 21, 2021

475
00:30:56,479 --> 00:30:59,357
THIS CONVERSATION TOOK PLACE 25 YEARS
AFTER THE BABY GARDEN INCIDENT

476
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,819
-Is this Mr. Yoon Bang-su?
-Yes.

477
00:31:02,902 --> 00:31:06,114
Is it true that you buried
Kang Mi-gyeong's body back then?

478
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:07,574
Yes, that's right.

479
00:31:07,657 --> 00:31:11,744
I said I didn't bury them
because of what Kim Ki-soon said to me.

480
00:31:12,662 --> 00:31:15,373
I heard she gave you land
for you changing your statement.

481
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:16,833
Is that correct?

482
00:31:16,916 --> 00:31:20,545
I guess you could say
that's one reason why I did it.

483
00:31:20,628 --> 00:31:23,047
-So did you receive land from her?
-Yes.

484
00:31:23,923 --> 00:31:25,592
TRANSFER ALL SHARES

485
00:31:26,092 --> 00:31:27,427

OWNER: YOON BANG-SU

487
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:34,100
After Nak-gwi died,
I drove his body over to the crematorium.

488
00:31:34,183 --> 00:31:36,185
Did Kim Ki-soon also order you to do that?

489
00:31:36,269 --> 00:31:37,270
Yeah, she did.

490
00:31:46,446 --> 00:31:49,407
I'm making this confession after 25 years.

491
00:31:50,116 --> 00:31:54,495
It was a month, no, two months
before Nak-gwi died.

492
00:31:56,456 --> 00:31:59,751
Kim Ki-soon
started looking around everywhere

493
00:31:59,834 --> 00:32:02,170
to see if anyone
was coming out of the factory.

494
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:04,422
After finding out there was nobody,

495
00:32:04,505 --> 00:32:11,012
she told me,
"Hey, we need to get rid of Nak-gwi."

496
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:12,639
So I said, "Sorry?"

497
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:16,643
"Are you going to send him
to his grandmother's place?"

498
00:32:16,726 --> 00:32:18,186
Then Yoon Bang-su showed up,

499
00:32:18,686 --> 00:32:22,023
so she stopped talking and said,
"Look, Yoon Bang-su is coming."

500
00:32:22,106 --> 00:32:24,525
When she said she wanted
to get rid of Nak-gwi

501
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:26,569
I had no idea what she meant by that.

502
00:32:26,653 --> 00:32:28,655
I only realized it after he died.

503
00:32:28,738 --> 00:32:32,283
"Oh, so when she was saying that,
she had it all planned out."

504
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:42,210
They're all the same.

505
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:45,630
They're all murderers. All of them.

506
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:49,467
JANUARY 1997
YOON BANG-SU CHANGES HIS STATEMENT

507
00:32:51,678 --> 00:32:56,391
MARCH 1997
NAK-GWI'S MOTHER TESTIFIES

508
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:58,768
There was no corpse or evidence.

509
00:32:58,851 --> 00:33:02,146
All that we had left was the testimony
from Nak-gwi's mother.

510
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:04,482
So, in such a desperate situation,

511
00:33:04,565 --> 00:33:08,653
the last trial to prove
Kim Ki-soon's guilt was held, but…

512
00:33:08,736 --> 00:33:14,993
To be frank, we weren't sure
if we would find Kang Mi-gyeong's body.

513
00:33:15,076 --> 00:33:17,161
But for Choi Nak-gwi's case,

514
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:20,581
the people who actually beat him
told us everything.

515
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:23,584
So, at least, we had enough witnesses.

516
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:25,294
Because he was cremated,

517
00:33:25,378 --> 00:33:27,880
we had enough evidence
to prove that he had died.

518
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:35,847
This is back
when Kim Ki-soon was hiding in a hotel.

519
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:39,392
She told her followers
to bring me to her quietly.

520
00:33:39,475 --> 00:33:41,728
"You'd better cooperate.
This is God's will."

521
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:46,482
"If we can get past this…"

522
00:33:46,566 --> 00:33:49,277
"If you do well,
as your role as a mother is important,

523
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,946
we have a chance to win this case."

524
00:33:52,613 --> 00:33:55,241
Then she hugged me
and told me to do well.

525
00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:00,538
Sun Yeong-re…

526
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:06,961
I can remember her.
I remember her coming to the Palace Hotel.

527
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:10,965
I think, for her testimony at the court,

528
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:14,886
they probably agreed
on the answers beforehand

529
00:34:14,969 --> 00:34:17,263
to different questions.

530
00:34:17,346 --> 00:34:22,185
"Nak-gwi was beaten and starved to death."

531
00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:25,188
And did you say that in court?

532
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:27,315
No, I couldn't.

533
00:34:28,941 --> 00:34:32,528
Because there were people
on the other side watching me so closely…

534
00:34:35,948 --> 00:34:37,825
I couldn't say it back then.

535
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:42,538
MARCH 4, 1997
THE DAY OF THE TRIAL

536
00:34:43,122 --> 00:34:45,374
I told the court
he didn't die from a beating

537
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:48,920
but from a heart attack
and myocardial infarction.

538
00:34:49,796 --> 00:34:51,839
DEATH CERTIFICATE
CHOI NAK-GWI

539
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:54,842
CAUSE OF DEATH: CARDIOPULMONARY ARREST

540
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:59,388
The women who had hit Choi Nak-gwi
admitted that they had done it,

541
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:03,309
but the mother of the child denied it.

542
00:35:03,392 --> 00:35:07,396
It was truly a sad
but also ridiculous situation.

543
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:13,611
Back then, I wanted to kill her.

544
00:35:13,694 --> 00:35:17,532
I called her a crazy woman too

545
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:18,699
because she lied.

546
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:22,912
My husband said,
"Wake up, you crazy woman."

547
00:35:24,038 --> 00:35:27,416
"Please, just listen to me.
Nak-gwi was beaten to death."

548
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,502
When he looked at me pleadingly,

549
00:35:29,585 --> 00:35:33,214
people on the other side
told me not to listen to him.

550
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:35,466
What did they do to her?

551
00:35:36,092 --> 00:35:38,594
What kind of wicked things
were said to her

552
00:35:38,678 --> 00:35:45,643
to convince her to lie
about the death of her precious son?

553
00:35:47,103 --> 00:35:53,234
Above all, it was heartbreaking
to watch even the maternal love

554
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:56,237
get completely trampled on.

555
00:36:11,085 --> 00:36:13,212
MARCH 1997
NAK-GWI'S MOTHER TESTIFIES

556
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:18,885
1998
THE SUPREME COURT'S VERDICT

557
00:36:18,968 --> 00:36:23,097
THE SUPREME COURT SENTENCES KIM KI-SOON
TO FOUR YEARS IN JAIL

558
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:25,183
WITH A FINE OF 5.6 BILLION WON

559
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:28,936
Defendant Kim, whose death penalty
was sought due to the Baby Garden case,

560
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:32,398
was found not guilty
of her murder and fraud charges.

561
00:36:32,481 --> 00:36:34,275
It was due to a lack of evidence.

562
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:37,528
The defendant, Kim Ki-soon,
was found not guilty of murder and fraud.

563
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:39,071
NOT GUILTY OF MURDER AND FRAUD

564
00:36:39,155 --> 00:36:41,991
She was found not guilty of murder
in both cases.

565
00:36:42,074 --> 00:36:43,868
But for Choi Nak-gwi's case,

566
00:36:43,951 --> 00:36:47,121
the court acknowledged
that he had been beaten and killed.

567
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:49,707
But they said the murder
had not been intentional.

568
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:52,210
"She was just trying to discipline him."

569
00:36:52,293 --> 00:36:54,253
"She didn't really want to kill him."

570
00:36:55,338 --> 00:37:00,801
She starved a child for two days,
beating him in the sweltering August heat.

571
00:37:01,677 --> 00:37:05,348
Was she really just trying
to discipline him?

572
00:37:06,182 --> 00:37:08,476
Did she really not know
that he would die?

573
00:37:20,154 --> 00:37:23,908
I sincerely regret taking the kid
to a place like that.

574
00:37:23,991 --> 00:37:27,995
I was so foolish to do something
that would break my own heart.

575
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:31,749
I wish that somebody would just beat me.

576
00:37:31,832 --> 00:37:36,087
If somebody could beat me to death,
then, of course, I…

577
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:42,802
I truly wish somebody
would just stone me to death.

578
00:37:42,885 --> 00:37:45,680
I want to apologize.
I want to say that I'm sorry.

579
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:49,225
It'd be shameless to ask for it,

580
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:53,062
but I still want to beg
for his forgiveness.

581
00:37:53,145 --> 00:37:57,149
I want to tell him it's all my fault,
and that I'm so sorry.

582
00:37:57,233 --> 00:37:59,068
What should I do now?

583
00:37:59,151 --> 00:38:02,113
Please beat me. It's all my fault.

584
00:38:03,406 --> 00:38:04,824
What do I do now?

585
00:38:04,907 --> 00:38:07,868
I wish I could die,
but I can't even do that.

586
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:28,014
NAK-GWI'S MOTHER STILL WISHES
FOR DEATH EVERY SINGLE DAY

587
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:32,810
AFTER PAYING HER FINE
OF 5.6 BILLION WON IN CASH

588
00:38:32,893 --> 00:38:36,814
KIM KI-SOON WAS RELEASED
AND SHE RETURNED TO THE BABY GARDEN

589
00:38:38,065 --> 00:38:40,109
KANG MI-GYEONG
WAS FINALLY PRONOUNCED DEAD

590
00:38:40,192 --> 00:38:43,487
24 YEARS AFTER SHE WAS REPORTED
AS MISSING

591
00:38:44,947 --> 00:38:48,034
THE VICTIMS OF THE BABY GARDEN
ARE STILL SUFFERING

592
00:38:48,117 --> 00:38:50,244
FROM POVERTY AND VARIOUS ILLNESSES

593
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:53,039
ALL INTERVIEWS IN THIS DOCUMENTARY
