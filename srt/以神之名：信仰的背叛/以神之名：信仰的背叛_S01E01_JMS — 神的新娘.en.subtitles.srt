5
00:00:18,059 --> 00:00:20,270
MAPLE, A VICTIM OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE,
CONSENTED TO REVEAL THE FOLLOWING CONTENT

6
00:00:20,353 --> 00:00:22,147
IN HOPES THAT THE SAME SUFFERING
WOULD NOT REPEAT WITH OTHER WOMEN

7
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:24,941
AS OF SEPTEMBER 2022, JEONG MYEONG-SEOK
IS DENYING THEIR SEXUAL RELATIONSHIP

8
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:26,568
Hug me.

9
00:00:28,778 --> 00:00:29,821
Hug me tight.

10
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:33,783
Say that you'll love the Lord forever.

11
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:35,785
I'll love you forever, Lord.

12
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:38,079
Wow, you have such wide hips.

13
00:00:39,205 --> 00:00:41,332
You have such wide hips, Soo-jeong.

14
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:45,670
You like that?

15
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:49,883
Did you come? Did you?

16
00:00:51,634 --> 00:00:53,386
Did you come? Did you squirt?

17
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:56,473
I think I came like 50 times.

18
00:00:57,098 --> 00:00:57,974
Fifty times.

19
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:17,452
MAPLE
KOREAN NAME: JEONG SOO-JEONG

20
00:01:17,535 --> 00:01:18,495
Thank you.

21
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:34,886
What he did was so perverted.

22
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:40,391
If he actually loved me,
he wouldn't have done that.

23
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:42,727
It was just so disgusting.

24
00:01:46,689 --> 00:01:50,652
I kept calling out to the Lord
as I was being victimized.

25
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:07,669
I asked God why I was going through
something like that.

26
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:14,425
JEONG MYEONG-SEOK
PRESIDENT OF JMS

27
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:16,177
Have you heard of "picking a fruit"?

28
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,056
They say, "Don't eat the pussy."

29
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,684
Right? "Don't touch the dick."

30
00:02:22,767 --> 00:02:24,978
"Just sleep,
why are you touching your dick?"

31
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:27,605
"Why are you touching your pussy again?"

32
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:31,693
Eve picked and ate the fruit.
So the woman ate the fruit.

33
00:02:31,776 --> 00:02:36,990
When a woman "picked and ate a man,"
it means she had sex with a man.

34
00:02:37,073 --> 00:02:40,118
It's the same for women.
They say that they "picked and ate a man."

35
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:54,883
BUT YOU MUST NOT EAT FROM THE TREE
OF THE KNOWLEDGE OF GOOD AND EVIL

36
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:57,051
FOR WHEN YOU EAT FROM IT
YOU WILL CERTAINLY DIE

37
00:02:57,135 --> 00:02:59,846
So, did you say you can't see God?

38
00:02:59,929 --> 00:03:01,723
Well, just look at me. Here's God.

39
00:03:01,806 --> 00:03:04,809
You don't need to search for God.
If you can't see God, look at me.

40
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:08,396
I said, "Do you know who I am?
I bet you don't. Well, I'm the Messiah."

41
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:14,194
Come here, my Lord.

42
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:19,490
You must be tired, my Lord.

43
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:21,910
Come and sit in the tub with us.

44
00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:24,829
We'll make you forget
about your tiredness.

45
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:40,053
IN THE NAME OF GOD: A HOLY BETRAYAL

46
00:03:49,854 --> 00:03:56,819
JMS, GOD'S BRIDES

47
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:05,620
MARCH 5TH, 2022
SEOUL

48
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,836
All right. One, two, three.

49
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:25,515
MAPLE
KOREAN NAME: JEONG SOO-JEONG

50
00:04:33,481 --> 00:04:36,192
My name is Maple.

51
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:39,654
I'm from Hong Kong,
and I'm 29 years old in Korean age.

52
00:04:40,321 --> 00:04:42,365
I'm a university student.

53
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:49,330
My name is Yip Huen. I am 28 years old.

54
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:01,050
What do you think people at JMS will say
when they watch this?

55
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:03,136
That I sold out the Lord.

56
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:18,109
I did some modeling
and street missionary work.

57
00:05:18,192 --> 00:05:21,696
Later, I also served
as a probationer and a pastor.

58
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:28,661
I pray that the flames of the Holy Spirit
will be given to us this year.

59
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:31,706
My Lord!

60
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:38,087
Even before I came to Korea,
I think people at JMS knew it already.

61
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:43,343
So they asked me if I was going to be
on a documentary.

62
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,679
Then they said that I shouldn't do it.

63
00:05:48,222 --> 00:05:50,391
Why is JMS threatening you?

64
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:55,271
Probably because I might reveal the truth?

65
00:05:56,731 --> 00:06:01,861
If I talk about how I was assaulted,

66
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:05,865
Jeong Myeong-seok might go back to prison.

67
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:07,742
Sexually assaulted.

68
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:18,544
At the airport, before I came to Korea,

69
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:23,007
I ran into a pastor from Hong Kong.

70
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:26,761
So I couldn't get to go on the plane
and had to leave the next day.

71
00:06:26,844 --> 00:06:30,681
But I ran into people
from JMS Hong Kong that day again.

72
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:33,559
JMS HONG KONG MEMBERS TRYING TO STOP HER
FROM LEAVING THE COUNTRY

73
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:37,146
MAPLE, DON'T GO ON THE DOCUMENTARY
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT KOREANS ARE LIKE

74
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,357
THEY'RE EVIL, THEY'LL JUST USE YOU

75
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,235
DID YOU KNOW I'M BEING FOLLOWED?

76
00:06:42,318 --> 00:06:46,239
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, FOLLOWED?
I SWEAR, I DIDN'T TELL ANYBODY

77
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:47,281
FEBRUARY 25TH, 2022

78
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:52,662
MAPLE CAME BACK TO KOREA
TO TESTIFY ABOUT THE SEXUAL ASSAULT

79
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:58,292
I eventually arrived in Korea.

80
00:06:58,376 --> 00:07:02,422
I got to the airport,
and I met with the producer.

81
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:04,632
Are you Maple?

82
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,676
Nice to meet you.

83
00:07:07,176 --> 00:07:08,386
You are Maple, right?

84
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:10,847
Let's go to our car over there.

85
00:07:12,723 --> 00:07:13,558
All right.

86
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,478
Later, I found out
that I had been followed.

87
00:07:19,647 --> 00:07:25,486
A car followed us
from the airport to the hotel.

88
00:07:44,338 --> 00:07:47,675
There was a car when I looked out
the window earlier.

89
00:07:47,758 --> 00:07:50,011
That car was there since the morning.

90
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:55,516
I sent a picture of it to the producer
because I thought it was strange.

91
00:07:56,100 --> 00:08:00,062
He told me that it was the same car that
had been following us from the airport.

92
00:08:05,234 --> 00:08:06,068
Yeah.

93
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:08,654
That's the one.

94
00:08:16,787 --> 00:08:20,500
You've been following us since yesterday
from Incheon Airport. Who are you?

95
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:22,251
Who are you?

96
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:26,881
You've been following us since yesterday
from the airport. Who are you?

97
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:29,425
And who are you in the back?

98
00:08:56,577 --> 00:08:57,495
Who is it?

99
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:02,291
Who is it?

100
00:09:05,836 --> 00:09:09,924
I didn't think I'd get an opportunity
like this again.

101
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:20,059
If I die or something bad happens to me…

102
00:09:21,477 --> 00:09:23,563
Before I came to Korea, my mom

103
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:27,608
met with people from JMS Hong Kong.

104
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:33,197
They told her that they had heard
about the documentary.

105
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:36,659
They said if I really do the documentary…

106
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:51,382
To be honest, I'm terrified.

107
00:09:57,179 --> 00:10:01,142
And then my mom told that person.

108
00:10:07,898 --> 00:10:10,568
"My daughter didn't do anything wrong."

109
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:28,544
1980
THE APPEARANCE OF JMS

110
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:35,593
JMS TAKES OVER UNIVERSITY TOWNS

111
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:48,939
Back then, none of the other churches
had so many college students.

112
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:53,402
So JMS was like a haven
for college students.

113
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:55,488
The 1980 MBC Campus Song Festival.

114
00:11:06,123 --> 00:11:10,628
JMS was a very popular religion
among college students in the '90s.

115
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:12,296
Going around the campus,

116
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:15,925
you'd see JMS clubs
and JMS evangelists everywhere.

117
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:22,139
90% OF JEONG MYEONG-SEOK'S FOLLOWERS
ARE UNIVERSITY STUDENTS

118
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:24,767
There were so many smart people there.

119
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:27,228
SNU, Yonsei, Korea University,
and POSTECH.

120
00:11:27,311 --> 00:11:31,357
Hongik University, KAIST, PNU,
Chonnam National University, and KNU.

121
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,361
All the universities at the time
were a part of it.

122
00:11:35,444 --> 00:11:38,197
In JMS, studying engineering
at Hanyang University

123
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,824
was nothing special.

124
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:43,703
There were so many people
from the top three universities in Korea.

125
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:47,456
JMS had about 200 to 250 churches

126
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:50,459
and about 30,000 members.

127
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:53,963
But most were students,
so they didn't receive many offerings.

128
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:58,259
So, during the school breaks, we'd say
we are raising money for the poor

129
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:03,264
and sell things like peanuts,
New Year's cards,

130
00:12:03,347 --> 00:12:06,350
and even water purifiers.
That's how we got funds for the church.

131
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:08,477
Looking back, it was like forced labor.

132
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:09,437
But back then,

133
00:12:10,312 --> 00:12:13,524
I thought it was volunteering,
devoting myself to the Lord.

134
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:16,736
That money got Mr. Jeong a Mercedes-Benz.

135
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:21,115
It was the late '80s, so not many people
owned a Mercedes-Benz car.

136
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:28,664
Sir, you can park over there.

137
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:33,461
Churches are usually
very culturally conservative, right?

138
00:12:33,544 --> 00:12:38,424
Well, JMS put a lot of emphasis
on religion,

139
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:41,343
but they were also
very open-minded culturally.

140
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:48,601
WOLMYEONGDONG MEMBERS

141
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:58,277
You could meet up with people
and do many things together.

142
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:03,491
That was such a huge appeal
for people in their twenties.

143
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:10,080
JEONG MYEONG-SEOK

144
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:14,084
The '80s were, you know,
a dark time in our history.

145
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:24,136
In the 1980s, South Korea was
under the control of a military dictator.

146
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:27,306
Those who were against the government
were killed.

147
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:29,809
The entire country was in chaos.

148
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:31,477
People didn't know how to live.

149
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,145
It was a very dark time.

150
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:36,732
None of the churches in Korea accepted us.

151
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:40,861
Whenever we got together at a college
to talk about the state of affairs,

152
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:43,948
a pastor would immediately show up
and yell at us to disband.

153
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:49,370
Back then, I think the student movements
grew into two main branches.

154
00:13:49,453 --> 00:13:53,999
One was "social and science clubs"
that carried out protests,

155
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:57,044
and the other was more focused on faith.

156
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:01,340
At the time, Jeong Myeong-seok's
teaching of the Bible

157
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:05,845
came across as a practical solution
to the problems.

158
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:10,766
GLOBAL MS FEDERATION
BOARD OF DIRECTORS

159
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:14,645
In JMS, I was the communications director,
education director, vice president…

160
00:14:14,728 --> 00:14:16,063
KIM GYEONG-CHEON
MISSION DIRECTOR

161
00:14:16,146 --> 00:14:17,231
…and seminary president…

162
00:14:17,314 --> 00:14:19,275
KIM GYEONG-CHEON, PASTOR
EX-VICE-PRESIDENT OF JMS

163
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:21,402
…until I left the organization
in December 2009.

164
00:14:21,485 --> 00:14:23,112
I'm Pastor Kim Gyeong-cheon.

165
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:32,580
There was always the matter
of salvation, rapture, and resurrection.

166
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:36,208
I had a hard time believing those things
from the Bible.

167
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:40,004
Then, in my freshman year of college,
an upperclassman told me

168
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:43,716
that there was somebody
who had read the Bible 2,000 times.

169
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:48,470
So I rushed him to take me to that guy.

170
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:51,599
That's how I met Jeong Myeong-seok.

171
00:14:53,642 --> 00:14:55,978
People told me
that the pastor prayed all the time

172
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:58,480
and read the Bible 2,000 times.

173
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:01,525
This is what Jeong Myeong-seok told me
as soon as I met him.

174
00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:04,528
"I saw you coming here in my dream."

175
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:08,532
It felt like he was looking
right through me.

176
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:15,623
In JMS, the Bible is seen as a metaphor.

177
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:20,711
When you look at it like that,
a whole new world opens up.

178
00:15:20,794 --> 00:15:25,299
As you can see, there are so many things
that people misunderstand about the Bible.

179
00:15:25,382 --> 00:15:29,345
"The Messiah will descend in a cloud."
"God will descend in a cloud."

180
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:31,805
You really think
that Jesus appeared in a cloud?

181
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:35,684
No. He came from Mary's body,
the Israelites,

182
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:38,646
and the people who believed
that he was the Messiah.

183
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:41,815
The cloud is a metaphor for people.
The cloud for pure people.

184
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:44,818
To describe how the crowd
gathered like clouds,

185
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:46,487
we would say, "To gather like clouds."

186
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:47,655
CLOUD - TO GATHER

187
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:51,367
When a huge crowd
starts to follow a religious leader,

188
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:54,536
those people become the cloud
in the Bible.

189
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:00,834
He'd gather a crowd
of 20,000 or 30,000 people behind him

190
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:02,670
and take pictures in front of them.

191
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:05,506
That way, he became
the Lord descending on a cloud.

192
00:16:07,841 --> 00:16:12,513
You know how most churches
talk about things

193
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:15,015
that are very unscientific?

194
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:18,394
In contrast, at JMS,

195
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:22,356
they explained things scientifically,
which made sense.

196
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:26,735
He had a knack for explaining
exactly what I wanted to know.

197
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:30,656
How could someone, who only went
to elementary school, know all this?

198
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:39,665
SINCHON

199
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:44,503
UNIVERSITIES LOCATED IN SINCHON

200
00:16:44,586 --> 00:16:47,381
After Jeong Myeong-seok arrived in Seoul,

201
00:16:47,464 --> 00:16:50,342
Sinchon was the first place
where he established a church.

202
00:16:54,888 --> 00:16:58,559
AROUND THE YEAR 1980
HE BECAME ACTIVE IN SINCHON

203
00:16:58,642 --> 00:17:02,938
Jeong Myeong-seok started out
in a small room in Sinchon.

204
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:09,153
At the time, he evangelized Mr. Ahn,
who was a grad student at SNU.

205
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:10,446
JEONG MYEONG-SEOK

206
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:13,490
Then Mr. Ahn evangelized a grad student
from Yonsei University.

207
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:16,869
Then that student evangelized a student
from Korea University.

208
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:20,080
Another person evangelized a student
from Ewha Womans University.

209
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:24,835
From the very beginning, JMS was focused
on students from elite universities.

210
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:30,758
KIM GYEONG-CHEON, JEONG MYEONG-SEOK

211
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:34,178
After establishing his first church,

212
00:17:34,261 --> 00:17:39,308
he moved his ministry to Samseon-gyo area
with four or five members.

213
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:44,730
Jeong Myeong-seok prayed for snow
on that day,

214
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:46,356
and it really did snow.

215
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:51,153
When I opened the window,
I saw that the snow had piled up.

216
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:55,115
"Sir, you are the Lord."

217
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:58,577
"And the reincarnation of Jesus Christ."
That's what I told him.

218
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:05,709
In other cults,

219
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:10,297
you can't really experience those intense
mystical experiences like you can in JMS.

220
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:15,844
Actually, that's why I decided
to join and follow them.

221
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:22,768
Jeong Myeong-seok gave a prophecy
for every single presidential election.

222
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:27,231
For example,
in the presidential election of 1987,

223
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:29,316
there was one Roh and three Kims, right?

224
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:35,072
For that election, he predicted
that Roh would become president.

225
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:46,834
Number one, Roh Tae-woo.
Number two, Kim Young-sam.

226
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:49,878
Number three, Kim Dae-jung.
Number four, Kim Jong-pil.

227
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:51,839
Then Jeong Myeong-seok said,

228
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:53,841
"They're all in numerical order."

229
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:57,803
The votes they received were in the order
of their campaign numbers.

230
00:18:57,886 --> 00:18:58,929
NATIONWIDE VOTES

231
00:18:59,012 --> 00:19:02,432
ROH TAE-WOO 36.0%, KIM YOUNG-SAM 27.3%
KIM DAE-JUNG 26.4%, KIM JONG-PIL 7.9%

232
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:04,935
I have no idea
how he predicted those things.

233
00:19:05,018 --> 00:19:08,105
He would say "I know you've been worried
about this and that."

234
00:19:08,188 --> 00:19:10,190
And that happened pretty often.

235
00:19:12,192 --> 00:19:15,654
One person thought
that their mother had a terminal illness

236
00:19:15,737 --> 00:19:18,866
and asked Jeong Myeong-seok to save her.

237
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:22,161
What did Jeong Myeong-seok tell him?
"Your mother isn't going to die."

238
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:26,582
After that, she stayed alive even though
the doctors pronounced her dead.

239
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:34,882
I couldn't believe
I had gotten diagnosed with cancer.

240
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:36,258
A JMS FOLLOWER AT THE TIME

241
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:38,552
I cried all night.

242
00:19:38,635 --> 00:19:40,679
I didn't know what to do.

243
00:19:40,762 --> 00:19:44,433
I just spent the entire night crying,

244
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:46,602
then I went to Mr. Jeong,
who prayed for me. Then…

245
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:48,437
HE SAID THERE WAS A PERSON WITH CANCER

246
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,606
WATCH YOUR HEALTH
FATIGUE IS NOT GOOD FOR YOU

247
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:52,274
R CAN CURE EVERYTHING WITH A TOUCH

248
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:53,275
JEONG MYEONG-SEOK

249
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:56,278
When I ran another test with ultrasound,

250
00:19:56,361 --> 00:20:00,407
I found that everything
looked completely normal like this.

251
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:06,246
I CAN FINALLY WALK NORMALLY

252
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:10,000
NOW I CAN WALK LIKE A HEALTHY PERSON
WITHOUT MUCH LIMPING

253
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:13,378
MY BACK HAS COMPLETELY HEALED

254
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:17,132
THE HOSPITAL COULDN'T DO ANYTHING
ABOUT MY ARTHRITIS AND HERNIATED DISK

255
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:18,926
BUT HIS PRAYER HEALED ME

256
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:21,136
I studied medicine when I was 17.

257
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,347
I mean, I studied medicine
for about 40 years.

258
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:24,973
That's how I can heal people.

259
00:20:25,849 --> 00:20:28,060
"Jeong Myeong-seok is the Messiah."

260
00:20:28,143 --> 00:20:30,520
People thought he was even higher
than Jesus,

261
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:34,191
as he would be the one to fulfill
the last prophecy.

262
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:37,152
That's 400 years after Luther's death.

263
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:40,239
So what's 1,546 plus 400?

264
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:42,115
It's 1946.

265
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:46,536
So, the Messiah will return in 1946.

266
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,622
Between 1945 and 1946. Why?

267
00:20:49,122 --> 00:20:51,541
There's the solar and the lunar calendar.

268
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:57,297
That means that the Messiah will be chosen
among those born between 1945 and 1946.

269
00:20:57,381 --> 00:21:01,677
He calculated the year
of the Second Coming of Jesus.

270
00:21:02,177 --> 00:21:04,680
He was calling himself
the subject of the prophecy.

271
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:08,934
You wanna know when I was born?

272
00:21:09,017 --> 00:21:11,436
I was born in 1945.

273
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:15,691
You know how we call out to the Lord
when we pray?

274
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:19,236
In my head, though, the Lord
was Jeong Myeong-seok, not Jesus.

275
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:22,489
Sometimes I even said things like,

276
00:21:22,572 --> 00:21:25,617
"In the name of Jeong Myeong-seok."

277
00:21:27,411 --> 00:21:30,122
So, did you say you can't see God?

278
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:31,915
Well, just look at me. Here's God.

279
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:35,085
You don't need to search for God.
If you can't see God, look at me.

280
00:21:35,168 --> 00:21:38,672
I said, "Do you know who I am?
I bet you don't. Well, I'm the Messiah."

281
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:43,844
"I pray in the name of the Lord,
Jeong Myeong-seok."

282
00:21:44,511 --> 00:21:46,596
I thought I was being such a good son.

283
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:51,727
I prayed that my mother could go to Heaven
in the name of the resurrected Jesus.

284
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:53,979
Mother asked me although she was dying.

285
00:21:54,062 --> 00:21:55,522
"What did you just say?"

286
00:21:58,525 --> 00:21:59,359
Well…

287
00:21:59,901 --> 00:22:02,571
That's what's so scary
about joining a heretic church.

288
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:08,201
Jesus called you the salt of the earth.
"You are the salt of the earth."

289
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:10,287
Why do you think he compared us to salt?

290
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:14,791
He could have compared us
to rocks, soy sauce, or chili paste.

291
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:17,753
Why didn't he say,
"You are the chili paste of the earth"?

292
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:20,339
"You're the chili peppers of the earth."

293
00:22:20,964 --> 00:22:23,467
You know,
"You are the chili peppers of the earth."

294
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:26,386
We would say,
"Yeah. Men have chili peppers."

295
00:22:27,804 --> 00:22:31,058
1980
THE APPEARANCE OF JMS

296
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:37,731
1991
THE APPEARANCE OF VICTIMS

297
00:22:37,814 --> 00:22:40,192
NOVEMBER 2000
RECORDING OF THE VICTIM'S COURT TESTIMONY

298
00:22:40,275 --> 00:22:43,737
Since you lived with Jeong Myeong-seok
for almost 20 years like his wife,

299
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:48,992
you observed his perverted actions
getting worse directly, right?

300
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:50,243
Yes, that's right.

301
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:53,872
You lived as the cult leader
Jeong Myeong-seok's slave

302
00:22:53,955 --> 00:22:56,208
until you turned 40,

303
00:22:56,291 --> 00:23:00,295
without getting married
or having a social life.

304
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:02,172
Then got kicked out, right?

305
00:23:02,255 --> 00:23:03,465
I didn't get kicked out.

306
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:08,512
I just wasn't getting treated
like a human being.

307
00:23:08,595 --> 00:23:12,557
It was so unfair and…
Jeong Myeong-seok was like Satan.

308
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:13,475
I see.

309
00:23:14,142 --> 00:23:17,396
In the early '90s, a lot of women
started joining JMS all of a sudden.

310
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:31,576
He would always be with women.

311
00:23:32,285 --> 00:23:33,787
They were all tall and pretty.

312
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:38,458
All of those women were like models
and were beautiful.

313
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:51,888
SEXUAL VIOLENCE VICTIM KIM JI-EUN (ANONYM)
JOINED IN 1991, AGE 16 AT THE TIME

314
00:23:51,972 --> 00:23:57,227
After I left JMS, I lived in silence.

315
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:59,729
But I recently gave birth to a child.

316
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:03,358
Looking at my kids, I realized
that I should speak up as a mother.

317
00:24:04,067 --> 00:24:07,154
Did Jeong Myeong-seok look
for specific things in women?

318
00:24:07,237 --> 00:24:10,407
He liked women who were taller
than 170 cm.

319
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:12,909
And I was over 170 cm at the time.

320
00:24:19,749 --> 00:24:20,667
WINTER, 1991

321
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:22,210
It was during a winter break.

322
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:24,129
It was at the end of ninth grade.

323
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:29,759
SEXUAL VIOLENCE VICTIM KIM JI-EUN (ANONYM)
IN NINTH GRADE AT THE TIME

324
00:24:29,843 --> 00:24:33,180
I was sitting and talking with a friend
at a park, and a man greeted us.

325
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,682
He said he wanted to talk to us.

326
00:24:37,225 --> 00:24:41,897
He told us that he was in a church
and that it was such a great church.

327
00:24:42,564 --> 00:24:46,860
He also said there was a great teacher
who knew a lot about Jesus.

328
00:24:47,444 --> 00:24:49,571
He wanted to introduce us to him.

329
00:24:52,449 --> 00:24:55,535
There was a church
on the second floor of a store building.

330
00:24:58,079 --> 00:25:01,124
People there were really optimistic
and bright.

331
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:04,753
They also cared for each other a lot.

332
00:25:07,422 --> 00:25:09,841
I went to their event in Wolmyeongdong,

333
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:13,386
and there were these people from SNU,
Korea University, Yonsei University…

334
00:25:17,057 --> 00:25:19,392
The followers from those universities…

335
00:25:19,476 --> 00:25:20,519
THE COLOR PARTY

336
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:24,064
…went on the stage
as cheerleaders and models.

337
00:25:25,565 --> 00:25:28,360
They were all taller than 170 cm
and were around 180 cm.

338
00:25:28,985 --> 00:25:32,864
When I saw them as a young girl,
they looked so grand and cool.

339
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:39,538
Then they naturally told me,
"We have a scripture called 30 Outlines."

340
00:25:39,621 --> 00:25:43,500
"Jeong Myeong-seok learned this
from Jesus himself."

341
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:45,544
"So you just have to study this Bible."

342
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:50,257
Basically, they were saying,
"He's the Messiah,"

343
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:52,801
and "Jeong Myeong-seok
is the Messiah of this era."

344
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:54,553
That was the main idea.

345
00:25:55,303 --> 00:25:57,389
When I reached the intermediate level,

346
00:25:57,472 --> 00:26:01,476
I thought, "Wait a minute.
Jeong Myeong-seok is the Messiah?"

347
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,769
So I asked.

348
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:06,231
"Is Mr. Jeong the Messiah?"

349
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:17,325
Jeong Myeong-seok traveled around
the country and held a variety of events.

350
00:26:17,951 --> 00:26:20,036
He held soccer matches,

351
00:26:21,204 --> 00:26:25,500
cheerleading events, and arts festivals.

352
00:26:26,876 --> 00:26:30,005
People from other regions
wanted to see Jeong Myeong-seok too

353
00:26:30,714 --> 00:26:32,799
and listen to his teachings in person.

354
00:26:32,882 --> 00:26:34,968
So he always had a lot of people
following him.

355
00:26:36,052 --> 00:26:37,429
Do you think he would meet anyone?

356
00:26:37,512 --> 00:26:38,722
KIM DO-HYEONG
ANTI-JMS ACTIVIST

357
00:26:38,805 --> 00:26:42,976
He'll meet with people who are very rich
or very powerful,

358
00:26:43,059 --> 00:26:46,563
but it's difficult for ordinary members
to meet him one-on-one.

359
00:26:55,697 --> 00:26:58,658
Most people would want to meet
with the resurrected Jesus

360
00:26:58,742 --> 00:27:02,203
and get some life advice
as well as talk about their problems.

361
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:04,623
But it was very hard to meet him.

362
00:27:05,582 --> 00:27:08,918
I'm going to join the military in a month.
Please pray for me.

363
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:10,712
Next month? That's a good time.

364
00:27:10,795 --> 00:27:11,796
-Next?
-Thank you.

365
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:12,714
Next…

366
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:18,178
Getting to meet Mr. Jeong was always
very glorious, honorable, and amazing.

367
00:27:18,261 --> 00:27:21,348
It was something to be grateful for.

368
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:26,227
They would say that he was coming
to give a sermon.

369
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:28,521
But he didn't just give a sermon.

370
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:34,402
He would find someplace to stay
and stay there for a day or two.

371
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:36,154
Not here, over there!

372
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:42,160
WE LOVE YOU, MR. JEONG

373
00:27:42,243 --> 00:27:44,412
I think it was June 1993.

374
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:46,831
I was in the 11th grade back then.

375
00:27:47,707 --> 00:27:48,583
So, a minor.

376
00:27:50,543 --> 00:27:53,880
One of the older girls there told me
that Jeong Myeong-seok was visiting,

377
00:27:54,381 --> 00:27:56,549
so she would request a meeting
with him for me.

378
00:27:56,633 --> 00:27:59,094
That way, I could receive his prayer.

379
00:27:59,803 --> 00:28:03,682
She said that she had requested
a one-on-one meeting with him.

380
00:28:10,814 --> 00:28:12,148
ACCOUNT FROM KIM
LEFT JMS IN 1999

381
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:13,525
When pretty girls joined,

382
00:28:13,608 --> 00:28:16,820
he held one-on-one meetings with them
after the religious teachings.

383
00:28:17,445 --> 00:28:19,989
Just like an ordinary church pastor would.

384
00:28:20,782 --> 00:28:23,159
That's when he did
all those unspeakable things.

385
00:28:26,162 --> 00:28:30,083
I was a bit excited, but nervous too.

386
00:28:31,418 --> 00:28:33,002
Meeting somebody like him

387
00:28:34,421 --> 00:28:37,424
was a once-in-a-lifetime chance for me
at the time,

388
00:28:37,507 --> 00:28:40,135
and it made me feel like
I was getting closer to God.

389
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:42,637
I told some older girls there,

390
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:46,057
"Should I try out for Miss Korea?
My family says that I should."

391
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:48,226
They said,
"Going for Miss Korea is dangerous."

392
00:28:48,309 --> 00:28:50,645
They also said,
"Men will never leave you alone."

393
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:51,980
"You should ask Mr. Jeong."

394
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:55,233
"Perhaps it would be safer
if you get God's permission."

395
00:29:02,073 --> 00:29:05,368
I went into the hotel room
Jeong Myeong-seok was in.

396
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:07,454
A woman was there with him.

397
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:13,376
She left when he told her to leave.

398
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:17,505
So I was left all alone in the room
with Jeong Myeong-seok.

399
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:28,141
I said I wanted to try out for Miss Korea,

400
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:31,519
but others said I shouldn't
and I needed his permission.

401
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:33,188
I asked him if I could try out.

402
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:37,484
Then he said he wanted to see
if I'd be able to try out.

403
00:29:37,567 --> 00:29:39,194
He told me to strip.

404
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:41,905
He told me to take off my pants.

405
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:45,950
I thought that maybe the Lord would know

406
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:50,163
if I should try out or not
once he takes a look at me.

407
00:29:50,246 --> 00:29:51,372
That's what I thought.

408
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:54,042
So I obliged and took off my pants.

409
00:29:57,337 --> 00:30:00,673
Then Jeong Myeong-seok grabbed me
at that moment.

410
00:30:04,511 --> 00:30:06,930
This is what he said at the time.

411
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:10,600
"If you try out, you'll just end up
getting screwed by men."

412
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:18,608
From that moment on, I just lay there
and I couldn't say a word.

413
00:30:19,275 --> 00:30:21,236
Jeong Myeong-seok climbed on top of me,

414
00:30:22,445 --> 00:30:24,239
then took his penis

415
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:28,743
and rubbed it on top of my vagina.

416
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:30,161
He performed a sexual act,

417
00:30:31,037 --> 00:30:33,373
then started touching my vagina
with his hands.

418
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:35,792
I didn't really catch it properly,

419
00:30:35,875 --> 00:30:38,628
but he was saying,
"Babe, call me honey. Honey."

420
00:30:38,711 --> 00:30:41,840
"Call me honey from now on.
You need to come and see me again."

421
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:47,846
Then he said that I could never tell
my parents or the people at church.

422
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:49,597
That it was a secret.

423
00:30:52,392 --> 00:30:57,397
I just walked over to my pants,
put them on, then got out of there.

424
00:31:03,236 --> 00:31:04,863
Were you an adult at the time?

425
00:31:05,655 --> 00:31:06,573
I was a minor.

426
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:14,664
They said he wasn't like that.
He was a pure man who wasn't even married.

427
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:18,793
They said he had never even held hands
with a woman.

428
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:22,005
But in the end, I was victimized.

429
00:31:22,088 --> 00:31:24,132
But back then, I didn't even know that.

430
00:31:27,093 --> 00:31:28,511
When I think about that day…

431
00:31:36,227 --> 00:31:38,438
They were probably very hopeful
and overjoyed

432
00:31:39,105 --> 00:31:41,524
as they believed
they'd be meeting the Lord,

433
00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:44,569
having a one-on-one meeting
with the Lord.

434
00:31:44,652 --> 00:31:49,198
Most of them probably…

435
00:31:49,282 --> 00:31:51,701
never thought those things would happen.

436
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:55,622
President Jeong Myeong-seok raped you

437
00:31:55,705 --> 00:32:00,251
after he invited you for a meeting,
is that correct?

438
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:02,170
Yes, that's how he always did it.

439
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:04,923
His excuses were meetings
or health check-ups.

440
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:09,093
AFFIDAVIT

441
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:11,304
H'S STATEMENT IN 2000
FOR A SEXUAL ABUSE CASE

442
00:32:11,387 --> 00:32:13,473
THE MEETING WITH MR. JEONG APPROACHED

443
00:32:13,556 --> 00:32:17,101
HE PUT HIS HAND IN MY SHIRT
AND TOUCHED MY BREASTS

444
00:32:17,644 --> 00:32:21,356
HE UNZIPPED MY PANTS
AND PUT HIS HAND IN MY UNDERWEAR

445
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:23,775
K'S STATEMENT
SUBMITTED IN 1999

446
00:32:23,858 --> 00:32:25,109
AT A HOTEL NEAR THE CHURCH

447
00:32:25,652 --> 00:32:28,571
A MEETING WITH FOUR THIRD-YEAR STUDENTS
IN HIGH SCHOOL

448
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:33,201
THE PRESIDENT WAS RUTHLESSLY
TOUCHING MY BREASTS WITHOUT HESITATION

449
00:32:33,284 --> 00:32:34,661
AFFIDAVIT FROM WITNESS J

450
00:32:34,744 --> 00:32:36,412
I HAD A MEETING WITH HIM IN HIS ROOM

451
00:32:36,496 --> 00:32:40,083
HE PUT HIS HAND IN MY VAGINA,
SAYING THAT HE WOULD DO A HEALTH CHECK-UP

452
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:44,295
I WAS FORCED TO HAVE INTERCOURSE WITH HIM

453
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:53,012
SEXUAL VIOLENCE VICTIM LEE YUN-JU (ANONYM)
JOINED IN 1992, AGE 19 AT THE TIME

454
00:32:53,846 --> 00:32:59,352
This woman suddenly approached me saying,
"Oh, hello," to me.

455
00:32:59,435 --> 00:33:02,522
Then she asked me how tall I was.

456
00:33:02,605 --> 00:33:04,232
That's what she asked me.

457
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:07,527
So being honest, I just told her
that I was 169.5 cm.

458
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:09,821
I didn't say I was 170 cm.
I was being honest.

459
00:33:09,904 --> 00:33:11,698
I told her that I was exactly 169.5 cm.

460
00:33:11,781 --> 00:33:14,951
Then she said, "You're basically 170 cm."
She was very happy about it.

461
00:33:17,704 --> 00:33:19,580
I remember that it was summer.

462
00:33:20,123 --> 00:33:26,045
It was during the August retreat.
Jeong Myeong-seok was playing volleyball,

463
00:33:26,129 --> 00:33:28,965
and I was cheering from the sidelines.

464
00:33:29,048 --> 00:33:33,136
But he kept looking over at me
while I was cheering.

465
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:36,723
So I was thinking,
"Why does he keep looking at me?"

466
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:42,937
After the volleyball game was over,

467
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:47,316
we put up our tents and went to bed
or got some rest.

468
00:33:49,193 --> 00:33:53,156
I was asleep and somebody woke me up,
saying that Mr. Jeong was looking for me.

469
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:57,994
So I put on my skirt and stockings
in a hurry and went.

470
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:02,165
I saw all these women standing in a line.

471
00:34:05,418 --> 00:34:07,962
She said I should go in first
because I was new.

472
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:10,173
So I thought that was just the way it was.

473
00:34:10,256 --> 00:34:12,133
I didn't suspect anything.

474
00:34:12,633 --> 00:34:16,012
I went in there because I wanted
to get his acceptance and blessing.

475
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:20,975
It felt a bit strange.

476
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:26,314
I also kind of thought of him
as a terrifying figure.

477
00:34:29,025 --> 00:34:31,194
He touched my thighs
and told me to come closer.

478
00:34:31,277 --> 00:34:34,489
He told me to come closer
and started pulling on my legs.

479
00:34:35,198 --> 00:34:40,745
Jeong Myeong-seok has set people's bones
for them many times.

480
00:34:42,288 --> 00:34:44,123
He'd been really famous for that.

481
00:34:47,668 --> 00:34:51,339
He said cheerleaders
shouldn't be bow-legged

482
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:53,508
and should have straight legs.

483
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:56,803
He said I was God's masterpiece
and I look amazing in God's eyes.

484
00:34:57,512 --> 00:34:59,764
Then he told me to spin around for him.

485
00:35:01,057 --> 00:35:04,894
I figured I should follow God's will,
so I walked away from him and walked back.

486
00:35:04,977 --> 00:35:08,481
Then he smiled and said I looked pretty.

487
00:35:12,735 --> 00:35:14,987
I smoothed out my clothes,
then sat back down.

488
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:18,241
And when I sat down next to him,

489
00:35:18,324 --> 00:35:22,120
Jeong Myeong-seok put his hand
inside my bra.

490
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:25,873
Then he closed his eyes and told me

491
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:30,378
that the Lord had ordered him to check
for any lumps in my breasts.

492
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:37,343
The other girl had already taught me
not to be surprised

493
00:35:37,426 --> 00:35:41,681
by Mr. Jeong doing such things
or health check-ups.

494
00:35:41,764 --> 00:35:43,432
She said he would cure illnesses.

495
00:35:44,225 --> 00:35:46,435
So I felt grateful.

496
00:35:49,188 --> 00:35:52,024
That's when he pushed me
and made me lie down on the bed.

497
00:35:52,108 --> 00:35:53,442
Yeah. As he laid me down,

498
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:56,612
he said he had to check
if my uterus was clean too.

499
00:35:56,696 --> 00:35:59,657
He told me wearing such tight underwear
was bad for me

500
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:02,493
and forced my stockings off.

501
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:07,165
Then he put his hand on my genitals
and started praying.

502
00:36:08,374 --> 00:36:09,709
As he was praying,

503
00:36:09,792 --> 00:36:14,630
he said, "Huh?
The Lord is telling me to examine you."

504
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:19,552
He said, "Women shouldn't have any cysts
in the uterus."

505
00:36:19,635 --> 00:36:21,596
He told me, "You can't have any cysts."

506
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:23,973
Then he licked his fingers,

507
00:36:24,056 --> 00:36:27,143
and after he did that,
he put his fingers in my vagina.

508
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:32,356
He said, "The Lord is examining you
right now. You should not move."

509
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,609
He kept moving his fingers around
inside me.

510
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:39,030
I told him that it hurt,
and Jeong Myeong-seok said

511
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:41,908
it always hurts the first time.

512
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:44,785
I looked because it hurt so much,
and found out

513
00:36:45,494 --> 00:36:48,623
that Jeong Myeong-seok
had already forced his penis in there.

514
00:36:51,667 --> 00:36:53,377
He then bit my breasts.

515
00:36:58,049 --> 00:37:01,469
He told me I'd have to keep
having intercourse with God.

516
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:04,347
He said, "You're God's bride now."

517
00:37:07,099 --> 00:37:10,061
He said I should never think of men,
let alone look at them.

518
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:14,357
He told me I'd go straight to Hell
if I betrayed the Lord.

519
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:19,904
Jeong Myeong-seok said that we'd end up
getting a divorce if we got married,

520
00:37:20,529 --> 00:37:23,783
or we'd give birth to deformed babies.

521
00:37:23,866 --> 00:37:26,202
That's how he used to scare us.

522
00:37:27,703 --> 00:37:29,455
C'S PETITION
WITNESS STATEMENT IN 2001

523
00:37:29,538 --> 00:37:32,291
HE MADE ME CALL HIM "DEAR,"
"HONEY" AND "OPPA"

524
00:37:32,375 --> 00:37:38,130
HE ALSO TOLD ME THAT I'D GO TO HELL
IF I DATED ANOTHER MAN

525
00:37:38,214 --> 00:37:39,382
HAND-WRITTEN COMPLAINT FROM K

526
00:37:39,465 --> 00:37:41,175
I WAS FORCED TO HAVE INTERCOURSE WITH HIM

527
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:44,262
JEONG ALWAYS THREATENED BY SAYING
THAT WOMEN WHO HAD SLEPT WITH HIM

528
00:37:44,345 --> 00:37:47,056
WOULD FALL TO THE SCARIEST PART OF HELL
IF THEY BETRAYED HIM

529
00:37:47,139 --> 00:37:48,641
N'S STATEMENT
SUBMITTED IN 2001

530
00:37:48,724 --> 00:37:51,727
JEONG TOLD ME
"WATCH OUT FOR OTHER MEN. YOU'RE MINE." 

531
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:54,146
"YOUR VAGINA WILL RIP
IF YOU MARRY SOMEBODY."

532
00:37:55,356 --> 00:37:59,026
As I left the room, I ran into a girl
who was overseeing things outside.

533
00:38:00,695 --> 00:38:03,572
THE APPEARANCE OF REPORTERS

534
00:38:05,616 --> 00:38:09,662
Basically, she was a link
that brought women to Jeong Myeong-seok.

535
00:38:11,998 --> 00:38:17,003
She looked like she knew exactly
what had happened to me in that room.

536
00:38:17,086 --> 00:38:20,965
She congratulated me on becoming a bride.

537
00:38:21,048 --> 00:38:24,844
She added, "We must only love the Lord now
since we're his brides."

538
00:38:26,262 --> 00:38:31,142
She was like,
"I bet it felt so good. How was it?"

539
00:38:33,436 --> 00:38:36,188
I asked her,
"Did you do this with him too?"

540
00:38:37,398 --> 00:38:40,609
She replied, "You won't get it at first,
but you'll understand everything in time."

541
00:38:40,693 --> 00:38:43,654
SEXUAL VIOLENCE VICTIM KIM JI-EUN (ANONYM)
JOINED IN 1991, AGE 16 AT THE TIME

542
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:45,197
I used to tell them…

543
00:38:45,281 --> 00:38:47,491
SEXUAL VIOLENCE VICTIM
FORMER REPORTER AT JMS

544
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:50,745
…that he might find some serious disease
through his examinations,

545
00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:55,624
and that they shouldn't be scared.
I used to say that a lot.

546
00:38:56,500 --> 00:39:01,881
I asked, "What would you do
if he touches you here or does this?"

547
00:39:01,964 --> 00:39:08,929
I said that in a playful and natural tone
to ensure this thing doesn't blow up.

548
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:18,898
I told her that having sex with him
was too confusing.

549
00:39:18,981 --> 00:39:21,359
And she said that it had happened
to her at first too.

550
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:22,735
SEXUAL VIOLENCE VICTIM MAPLE

551
00:39:22,818 --> 00:39:25,946
She said it had been confusing
for her too, when she was a newbie.

552
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:29,909
But she said that after she prayed,
she realized

553
00:39:29,992 --> 00:39:31,577
that it was God's love.

554
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:39,460
They say the role is to tell the president
about what happens in the church.

555
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:42,630
But why do "reporters" all have to be
women in their early twenties?

556
00:39:42,713 --> 00:39:44,465
Can't men do the exact same thing?

557
00:39:44,548 --> 00:39:46,884
Simply put, the reporters

558
00:39:48,302 --> 00:39:50,679
are his mistresses and sex partners.

559
00:39:51,263 --> 00:39:53,140
Come here, my Lord.

560
00:39:56,143 --> 00:39:58,396
You must be tired, my Lord.

561
00:39:58,479 --> 00:40:00,815
Come and sit in the tub with us.

562
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:03,651
We'll make you forget
about your tiredness.

563
00:40:03,734 --> 00:40:07,363
I love you, honey!

564
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:11,867
I know most of those reporters.

565
00:40:11,951 --> 00:40:14,245
Most of them are probably pastors by now.

566
00:40:14,328 --> 00:40:18,707
Once they sleep with Jeong Myeong-seok,
they are given some kind of title,

567
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:20,543
such as evangelist,

568
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:22,711
probationer, or reporter.

569
00:40:22,795 --> 00:40:25,256
One of their biggest goals
in missionary work

570
00:40:25,339 --> 00:40:27,716
is to bring Jeong Myeong-seok
more pretty women.

571
00:40:28,968 --> 00:40:30,636
It's an endless supply of women.

572
00:40:32,346 --> 00:40:33,639
During my time there,

573
00:40:35,182 --> 00:40:36,434
I changed a bit too.

574
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:41,689
I started adjusting my behavior
to match Jeong Myeong-seok's

575
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:46,569
and tried to do more things
that he liked, little by little.

576
00:40:46,652 --> 00:40:49,363
I just did whatever he told me to do.

577
00:40:52,366 --> 00:40:59,039
If a girl is pretty or tall,
they try really hard to convert her.

578
00:40:59,665 --> 00:41:03,210
They said since we're now
looking for his brides,

579
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:04,837
we need to consider looks too.

580
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:08,257
We had to find somebody
with all the qualities.

581
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:12,553
Jeong Myeong-seok
craves younger women.

582
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:18,142
Jeong Myeong-seok may not want you
nor have intercourse with you anymore.

583
00:41:18,225 --> 00:41:21,937
But if you bring young women to him,

584
00:41:22,021 --> 00:41:24,940
then you'll get more benefits accordingly.

585
00:41:25,024 --> 00:41:26,734
That's how you can become a pastor

586
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:29,737
and get some money to take care
of the other girls.

587
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:32,573
As they continue to be active members,

588
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:36,452
they start recruiting other women
and bringing them.

589
00:41:36,535 --> 00:41:39,747
That's how the victims turn
into the perpetrators.

590
00:41:43,709 --> 00:41:46,921
THE SECRET OF THE FORBIDDEN FRUIT

591
00:41:50,257 --> 00:41:51,842
"She ate the forbidden fruit."

592
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:56,222
Eve picked and ate the fruit.

593
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:01,143
That's what is written in Genesis,
but Mr. Jeong sees it as a metaphor.

594
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:05,231
He interprets the forbidden fruit
as a woman's genitals.

595
00:42:06,232 --> 00:42:08,567
So "picking the fruit" means having sex.

596
00:42:10,069 --> 00:42:12,446
Since Jeong Myeong-seok
realized this metaphor,

597
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:15,491
he'd become the savior
who saves mankind from corruption.

598
00:42:15,574 --> 00:42:19,411
Basically, by not letting people
freely have sex,

599
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:24,583
he'll become the savior of humankind.

600
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,006
Then why is he like that?

601
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:33,968
He says he can do it
because he's the "Perfect Adam."

602
00:42:34,051 --> 00:42:37,846
Because he's the Perfect Adam,
having sex isn't an act of corruption.

603
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:41,141
Rather, it's an act of salvation.

604
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:44,436
In order to meet God
through Jeong Myeong-seok,

605
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:47,147
it was through sexual intercourse
like a bride and a groom.

606
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:50,192
He said, "To save sexually corrupted Eve,

607
00:42:50,276 --> 00:42:53,862
I must obey God's orders
regardless of my will."

608
00:42:53,946 --> 00:42:56,782
So, having sex with Jeong Myeong-seok

609
00:42:57,366 --> 00:43:02,621
meant that God was expressing God's love
through Jeong Myeong-seok's body.

610
00:43:02,705 --> 00:43:07,251
"This isn't a sexual crime.
You're merely receiving the love of God."

611
00:43:07,334 --> 00:43:09,086
"You should be thankful."

612
00:43:11,463 --> 00:43:18,429
1945
THE BIRTH OF WOLMYEONGDONG JMS

613
00:43:41,577 --> 00:43:47,958
The joyful nation of providence

614
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:58,969
Dalbak-gol, Seokmak-ri, Jinsan-myeon,
Geumsan-gun, Chungcheongnam-do.

615
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:03,057
They called it Dalbak-gol
because the moon rose so brightly there.

616
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:05,643
So they changed the name
to Wolmyeongdong later.

617
00:44:06,352 --> 00:44:08,103
The place is deep in the mountains,

618
00:44:09,063 --> 00:44:11,357
but to them, it's the birthplace of Jesus.

619
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:13,025
Like the Jerusalem in the East.

620
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:17,571
They turned his birthplace
into a sanctuary.

621
00:44:18,072 --> 00:44:22,201
That's where tens,
hundreds of women lived together.

622
00:44:23,369 --> 00:44:25,454
They all lived together in Wolmyeongdong.

623
00:44:27,373 --> 00:44:31,335
There were a few shipping containers
in Wolmyeongdong.

624
00:44:33,212 --> 00:44:34,880
That's where his brides lived.

625
00:44:35,381 --> 00:44:38,717
The containers were divided
into two stories, and in each room,

626
00:44:39,218 --> 00:44:42,680
women were crammed in there,
living in awful conditions.

627
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:52,856
Whenever they planted trees
or worked on stones,

628
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:57,069
we had to stand next to them
and watch the entire time.

629
00:44:58,404 --> 00:45:04,743
Those were supposed to be
God's accomplishments and God's work.

630
00:45:04,827 --> 00:45:06,453
He said we had to watch,

631
00:45:06,537 --> 00:45:09,665
and that we would be enlightened.

632
00:45:10,207 --> 00:45:12,751
So we just stood there and watched.

633
00:45:16,004 --> 00:45:20,551
During the day, he usually played soccer
in front of people.

634
00:45:20,634 --> 00:45:24,388
Or he would play volleyball.
That's how he spent the day sometimes.

635
00:45:24,471 --> 00:45:25,389
Let's go!

636
00:45:26,598 --> 00:45:28,267
Another goal!

637
00:45:34,189 --> 00:45:37,025
All right, okay, he's going fast.

638
00:45:37,943 --> 00:45:40,529
Yes, he's going fast, he's going. Shoot!

639
00:45:41,155 --> 00:45:42,489
Goal!

640
00:45:43,615 --> 00:45:46,535
He would score something like 60 goals
in a soccer game.

641
00:45:47,953 --> 00:45:50,873
They used to be like,
"He has scored 1,200 goals in total."

642
00:45:52,332 --> 00:45:57,337
He could score so many goals
because they played for five to six hours.

643
00:45:58,172 --> 00:46:01,467
And the other players
didn't really take any shots.

644
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:05,012
They all let Jeong Myeong-seok take shots.

645
00:46:07,514 --> 00:46:12,644
And the opponents would only pretend
to defend Jeong Myeong-seok.

646
00:46:12,728 --> 00:46:15,606
The goalkeeper dived
in the opposite direction.

647
00:46:19,943 --> 00:46:22,154
From afar, he's diving dramatically,

648
00:46:22,905 --> 00:46:24,364
but he falls the other way.

649
00:46:25,741 --> 00:46:28,744
We used to cheerlead for him
on the sidelines.

650
00:46:28,827 --> 00:46:33,499
We gave him high-fives, brought him water,
and wiped his sweat for him.

651
00:46:34,124 --> 00:46:36,627
That's what we were supposed to do.

652
00:46:37,252 --> 00:46:40,130
As the game nears the end,
she would assess the situation.

653
00:46:41,215 --> 00:46:44,343
And she'd tell us to go
and wait in the bathroom.

654
00:46:45,469 --> 00:46:47,971
We were to receive his blessings
after the shower.

655
00:46:48,806 --> 00:46:53,519
When he came inside,
we took off his clothes and washed him.

656
00:46:53,602 --> 00:46:57,147
Then Jeong Myeong-seok washed us too,

657
00:46:57,231 --> 00:47:00,317
then had intercourse with each of us.

658
00:47:11,662 --> 00:47:13,413
It usually happened in the morning.

659
00:47:13,497 --> 00:47:15,874
That's when he usually had sex.

660
00:47:15,958 --> 00:47:16,792
All night long.

661
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:21,755
Even when he was sleeping,
he would keep waking up

662
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:23,257
and having sex.

663
00:47:24,091 --> 00:47:26,635
JEONG MYEONG-SEOK'S ROOM

664
00:47:26,718 --> 00:47:29,680
Around 2:00 or 3:00 a.m.,

665
00:47:29,763 --> 00:47:36,353
one of the women there would start
performing fellatio for Jeong Myeong-seok

666
00:47:37,312 --> 00:47:39,481
and then start having sex.

667
00:47:39,565 --> 00:47:43,318
Or Jeong Myeong-seok would wake up first

668
00:47:44,361 --> 00:47:47,906
and pull the women on top of him.

669
00:47:49,408 --> 00:47:50,492
J'S PETITION
SUBMITTED IN 2000

670
00:47:50,576 --> 00:47:52,411
I WENT IN WITH THREE OR FOUR GIRLS
WHO WERE AROUND MY AGE

671
00:47:52,494 --> 00:47:54,162
AND ONE BY ONE,
WE GOT ABUSED BY THE PETITIONEE

672
00:47:54,246 --> 00:47:57,207
S'S EXAMINATION RECORD
SUSPECT-VICTIM CONFRONTATION IN 2001

673
00:47:57,291 --> 00:47:59,126
FIVE TO SIX OF US WENT INTO HIS ROOM

674
00:47:59,209 --> 00:48:00,210
THE LAMP WAS ON

675
00:48:00,294 --> 00:48:03,130
HE HAD SEX WITH US
STARTING WITH THE GIRL AT THE VERY END

676
00:48:05,549 --> 00:48:07,509
HWANG'S STATEMENT
SEXUAL ASSAULT AND KIDNAPPING VICTIM, 1999

677
00:48:07,593 --> 00:48:10,095
I HEARD THERE WERE THREE TO FOUR GIRLS
AND SOMETIMES MORE THAN 30

678
00:48:10,178 --> 00:48:12,514
I ONCE HAD SEX WITH THE PRESIDENT
WHILE THREE PEOPLE WATCHED

679
00:48:12,598 --> 00:48:15,017
NOVEMBER 2000
RECORDING OF THE VICTIM'S COURT TESTIMONY

680
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:16,727
There were 10 to 15 girls sometimes.

681
00:48:16,810 --> 00:48:20,272
They made all of us strip by ourselves
once we went inside.

682
00:48:20,355 --> 00:48:23,817
Jeong Myeong-seok's testicles
got so red and swollen

683
00:48:23,901 --> 00:48:27,571
that one time, he got a fever.

684
00:48:29,156 --> 00:48:31,742
It'd probably be
more than 50 people each day.

685
00:48:33,243 --> 00:48:34,077
Around 50?

686
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:37,789
Don't think of it as ordinary sex.

687
00:48:37,873 --> 00:48:41,919
At times, he just put his penis in and out
or moved it a little, then pulled out.

688
00:48:42,586 --> 00:48:43,962
His objective was penetration.

689
00:48:44,671 --> 00:48:48,091
His goal was just to claim the woman
as his own.

690
00:48:49,217 --> 00:48:51,386
I think there were times
when it was 100 women.

691
00:48:54,181 --> 00:48:57,059
Once I asked Jeong Myeong-seok
what would happen

692
00:48:57,142 --> 00:49:00,062
if I got pregnant
while making love with the Lord.

693
00:49:00,145 --> 00:49:02,522
Then he asked,
"Do you want to get pregnant?"

694
00:49:02,606 --> 00:49:05,192
"If you get pregnant,
you can't have sex with me anymore."

695
00:49:05,275 --> 00:49:06,610
"You need to get surgery."

696
00:49:08,445 --> 00:49:10,697
"Wait, I got pregnant
with the Messiah's baby,

697
00:49:11,198 --> 00:49:13,825
but I have to get an abortion?"
It was a big shock to me.

698
00:49:13,909 --> 00:49:16,161
So, sex was his priority.

699
00:49:27,798 --> 00:49:31,343
I kept getting bloody discharge,
so I went to the hospital.

700
00:49:32,386 --> 00:49:35,806
They recommended a biopsy for me.

701
00:49:37,265 --> 00:49:39,017
They said it might be cancer.

702
00:49:39,101 --> 00:49:41,436
It turns out
I had early-stage uterine cancer.

703
00:49:42,062 --> 00:49:44,398
They said it might spread to other parts,

704
00:49:44,481 --> 00:49:47,359
so they'd have to remove the entire organ.

705
00:49:47,943 --> 00:49:49,903
To remove the entire uterus.

706
00:49:51,488 --> 00:49:53,490
I was so shocked.

707
00:49:54,324 --> 00:49:58,870
Jeong Myeong-seok prayed over my genitals
and blessed them every single day.

708
00:50:00,664 --> 00:50:02,165
But I still got cancer.

709
00:50:09,506 --> 00:50:11,341
There are so many disgusting things.

710
00:50:12,509 --> 00:50:15,429
If we get into details,
it'll get really disgusting.

711
00:50:23,228 --> 00:50:26,606
Once there was a news broadcast
about a huge fire on TV.

712
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:31,695
It showed the scene of the fire,
which left all of us heartbroken.

713
00:50:41,830 --> 00:50:44,124
While we were watching that, suddenly,

714
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:47,002
Jeong Myeong-seok was mumbling something.

715
00:50:47,961 --> 00:50:51,089
Then he started stroking the TV
all of a sudden,

716
00:50:51,173 --> 00:50:53,717
saying, "What a waste of pussies."

717
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:56,219
I couldn't believe my own ears.
I was so shocked.

718
00:51:03,935 --> 00:51:06,396
Then he poked the girl next to him saying,

719
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:09,232
"I couldn't use them
because you didn't convert them."

720
00:51:09,316 --> 00:51:11,735
He told her,
"You should've brought them to me."

721
00:51:11,818 --> 00:51:15,697
I was watching that happen
in complete disbelief.

722
00:51:15,781 --> 00:51:18,075
All he said while watching
that disaster was,

723
00:51:18,158 --> 00:51:21,161
"They died before I used them
because you didn't bring them."

724
00:51:22,579 --> 00:51:24,706
NOVEMBER 2000
RECORDING OF THE VICTIM'S COURT TESTIMONY

725
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:26,750
Though many women
want to sue Jeong Myeong-seok,

726
00:51:26,833 --> 00:51:29,544
I heard they still can't to this day.
Why is that?

727
00:51:29,628 --> 00:51:32,631
Every single morning,
he threatens to kill my mother.

728
00:51:33,298 --> 00:51:34,216
-Every morning?
-Yes.

729
00:51:34,299 --> 00:51:36,885
I heard they came to her house
yesterday too.

730
00:51:58,990 --> 00:52:00,784
