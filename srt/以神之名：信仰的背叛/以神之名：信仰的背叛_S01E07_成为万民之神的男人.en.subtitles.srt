1
00:00:21,104 --> 00:00:24,733
Members of Manmin Central Church
stormed the building,

2
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:29,946
temporarily suspending the broadcast
in an unprecedented incident.

3
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:41,624
The broadcaster!

4
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:43,376
-Must wake up!
-Must wake up!

5
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:45,420
-MBC!
-MBC!

6
00:00:45,503 --> 00:00:47,714
-Must respect!
-Must respect!

7
00:00:47,797 --> 00:00:50,884
Manmin Central Church followers
broke into MBC's main control room,

8
00:00:50,967 --> 00:00:54,304
stole the videotapes,
and stopped the broadcast.

9
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:00,518
Who would do that because they want to?

10
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:03,563
They'd often be hiding…

11
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:10,862
WE APOLOGIZE FOR THE TRANSMISSION ISSUE

12
00:01:10,945 --> 00:01:12,864
The police and prosecutors
have determined

13
00:01:12,947 --> 00:01:15,742
this incident as a major threat
to national security.

14
00:01:15,825 --> 00:01:18,995
They're planning on arresting
Pastor Lee Jae-rock if he's found to have

15
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:20,455
instigated his followers.

16
00:01:20,538 --> 00:01:21,664
Fuck!

17
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:24,751
Facing the religious group's actions,

18
00:01:24,834 --> 00:01:28,088
the broadcast and even the authorities
were proven to be helpless.

19
00:01:28,838 --> 00:01:31,758
MBC TO CLAIM TWO TO THREE BILLION WON
FOR THE DAMAGES

20
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:34,886

IN THE NAME OF GOD: A HOLY BETRAYAL

23
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:04,874
THE MAN WHO BECAME GOD OF MANMIN

24
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:21,432
It happened in May 1999,
so it's been about 22 years.

25
00:02:22,058 --> 00:02:26,354
When you experience something like that,
it's pretty hard to forget about it.

26
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:29,399
I can still remember it very vividly.

27
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:39,033

THE MBC RAID

00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:41,119
PD NOTE: EPISODE 363
SHEPHERD! OUR SHEPHERD!

29
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:49,919
PD NOTE

30
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:59,637
PD Note is basically a TV program
that receives reports from the viewers,

31
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:02,599
and each program topic
is based on one of those reports.

32
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:05,435
We were consistently getting
a lot of reports

33
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:08,396
about Manmin Central Church.

34
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:12,567
UNITED HOLINESS CHURCH OF KOREA MANMIN
MANMIN CENTRAL CHURCH

35
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:14,736
The videos that we received

36
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:18,239
would show a person in a wheelchair
suddenly standing up and walking.

37
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:23,494
Or a blind person regaining their vision.

38
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:26,581
It was hard to believe,
so I thought, "This must be rigged."

39
00:03:27,123 --> 00:03:29,584
But I went there only to find
those things in the video

40
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:31,252
were actually happening.

41
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:37,508
And people were actually all reacting
to what was going on as a group.

42
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:39,427
So I thought it was a bit scary.

43
00:03:45,808 --> 00:03:49,646
You must all understand why believers
will be free from illnesses and evil,

44
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:52,607
be healed by God himself,

45
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:56,653
just by touching my clothes,
just by looking into my eyes,

46
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:59,614
just by touching my shadow
or me laying a handkerchief on them.

47
00:03:59,697 --> 00:04:01,532
Why are you sweating so much?

48
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:02,742
There's so much sweat.

49
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:08,414
Be cleansed with the fire
of the Holy Spirit.

50
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:10,708
Be cleansed with the fire
of the Holy Spirit.

51
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:11,876
Be cleansed.

52
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,212
Be cleansed with the fire
of the Holy Spirit.

53
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:17,131
Be cleansed with the fire
of the Holy Spirit.

54
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:26,182
Please, my Lord.

55
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:28,226
Thank you, my Lord, in the name of Jesus…

56
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:34,774
It was basically a cult
pretending to be an ordinary church.

57
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:40,238
Pastor Lee Jae-rock was a con artist
in the mask of a pastor.

58
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:42,949
-Jesus!
-Jesus!

59
00:04:43,032 --> 00:04:44,284
-Jesus!
-Jesus!

60
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:45,994
-Jesus!
-Jesus!

61
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:47,578
-Jesus!
-Jesus!

62
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:49,247
-Jesus!
-Jesus!

63
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,041
God, our Father.

64
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:58,298
Please descend upon us and grace us
with your presence on this altar.

65
00:04:58,381 --> 00:04:59,716
Amen!

66
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,468
-Do you see that brilliant light?
-Amen!

67
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:04,971
Do you see
that the light is brighter than usual?

68
00:05:05,054 --> 00:05:06,639
Do you see that shining light?

69
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:10,476
If you look to Pastor Lee's left,
on the screen,

70
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:14,731
you see the white thing, right?
On the second-floor balcony, on the left.

71
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:18,985
You can see that an angel
has spread its wings, right there.

72
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:19,902
-Amen!
-Right.

73
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:22,071
Oh, my Lord.

74
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:23,781
Got bigger, right? Look at the angel.

75
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:26,409
You can see it
even if you're spiritually blind.

76
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:29,078
Even those whose spiritual eyes
aren't open can see it.

77
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:31,914
Even those whose spiritual eyes
aren't open can see it.

78
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:33,958
All right, everyone, take a good look.

79
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,002
We've all been rewarded today.

80
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:37,545
Excuse me, Pastor Lee.

81
00:05:37,628 --> 00:05:39,714
Please hold your mic and stay still,

82
00:05:39,797 --> 00:05:43,343
and don't move the hand
with the mic in it.

83
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:45,178
-Our camera…
-Yes.

84
00:05:45,261 --> 00:05:47,722
Our camera number two caught it.

85
00:05:47,805 --> 00:05:49,349
On the back of Pastor Lee's hand,

86
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:51,768
there's an eagle
and the four living creatures.

87
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:55,605
This is real. Please look at the screen.

88
00:05:56,272 --> 00:05:57,106
Hallelujah.

89
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:02,153
Look at the head.
Look at the head and all the light.

90
00:06:02,945 --> 00:06:04,614
Do you see the crown on the head?

91
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:09,577
He's in the center of light even if you go
to the canyon over the hill.

92
00:06:12,246 --> 00:06:15,291
He's the light. He's the light itself.

93
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:19,087
They were trying to make it look
like the light was shining in the back

94
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:23,007
and angels were flying in
when Pastor Lee was preaching.

95
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:25,927
But all those images are all fabricated.

96
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:32,725
The host and the people involved
planned everything out beforehand.

97
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:35,895
It's like a comedy show.

98
00:06:35,978 --> 00:06:38,481
Even though it's like a comedy show,

99
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:40,983
they start believing that it's real.

100
00:06:42,151 --> 00:06:45,738
Honestly, I think that guy has watched
way too many movies.

101
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:48,908
When I prayed,
I didn't ask for things like,

102
00:06:48,991 --> 00:06:51,744
"Our Father, please give me
billions of won."

103
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:55,748
I prayed, "God, our Father,
the minimum I need is 40 billion won."

104
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:58,751
"I need 40 billion won right away,
at the very least."

105
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:01,003
"And it should be more
than 100 billion won."

106
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:03,506
It was my prayer last week.
More than 100 billion won.

107
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:05,216
My prayer for this week has changed.

108
00:07:05,299 --> 00:07:08,636
"I'm trying to quickly carry out
Your will in all countries."

109
00:07:08,719 --> 00:07:11,597
"A hundred billion isn't enough,
nor are hundreds of billions."

110
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:13,391
"You must give me trillions of won."

111
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:21,149
I heard that Pastor Lee was using
the church's money as he pleases.

112
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:24,861
That when he goes gambling, he uses
hundreds of millions of won at a time.

113
00:07:33,494 --> 00:07:34,829
He went to Las Vegas.

114
00:07:34,912 --> 00:07:37,457
I mean, his bets were on another level.

115
00:07:38,749 --> 00:07:40,460
If he loses a million won on odds,

116
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,837
he'll bet two million won on odds again.

117
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:47,383
If he loses his money again,
he'll bet six million on odds.

118
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,177
If he loses again,

119
00:07:50,052 --> 00:07:51,554
he'll bet 18 million won.

120
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:53,681
And if he loses again?

121
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:56,684
Then he'll bet double the amount
of 27 million won again.

122
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:02,315
It became really nerve-wracking later.

123
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:09,572
The thing is, that money actually came
from the church members' offerings.

124
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:13,826
Why on earth would I go to Las Vegas?
What would be so good about going there?

125
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:16,537
I could go somewhere
to relax and enjoy myself.

126
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:20,833
But I went there as I thought,
"Since I have a few extra days,

127
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:25,004
I'll try to take care
of the church finances."

128
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:26,881
All our church staff here know too.

129
00:08:26,964 --> 00:08:29,759
I couldn't take a break or go on vacation.

130
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:33,054
How pathetic is it to just keep sitting
in front of that machine?

131
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:35,598
Who would do that because they want to?

132
00:08:40,728 --> 00:08:43,523
What concerned us the most was

133
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:46,984
that many female followers
were victims of sexual abuse,

134
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:48,778
such as sexual harassment or assault.

135
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:52,448
There were three or four victims
that we met.

136
00:08:56,577 --> 00:08:58,913
We asked them where it had happened.

137
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:10,049
There was a place called "Epang Palace."

138
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:14,470
And apparently, they called
the place "Heaven."

139
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:16,931
He asked if I knew about the place.

140
00:09:17,014 --> 00:09:19,433
He said it was the Garden of Eden,

141
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:22,019
and it wasn't hideous to be naked there.

142
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:24,564
He also said there is no evil or sin,

143
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:28,651
as he casually did things like kissing
or touching breasts.

144
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:31,904
He was always the first
to demonstrate everything himself.

145
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:38,369
He fondled his genitals
and told us to all try it too.

146
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,871
To hear Pastor Lee's side of the story,

147
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:43,958
we tried many times to see him
and eventually went to visit him.

148
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:47,003
We actually went to Pastor Lee's house.

149
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:49,505
Pastor Lee has his yearly schedule
all planned out.

150
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:52,592
Actually, some schedules are planned
over two years.

151
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:54,635
We are here
because Pastor Lee is involved.

152
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:57,096
Even if he is, we still need enough time.

153
00:09:57,179 --> 00:09:58,723
We gave you plenty of time--

154
00:09:58,806 --> 00:10:02,184
One week is not enough for us,
let alone a month.

155
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:07,189
They suddenly got these cameras
and started filming us too.

156
00:10:08,065 --> 00:10:12,486
They brought equipment and cameras
that were even better than ours.

157
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:14,864
Then they started interviewing us instead

158
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:17,283
and said they would film and report us.

159

1999
THE MBC RAID

160
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:41,849
MAY 11, 1999
THE DAY OF THE BROADCAST AT 2:00 P.M.

161
00:10:41,932 --> 00:10:44,685
We kept on getting complaint calls
for the entire month

162
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:47,021
of preparing
the Manmin Central Church story.

163
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:49,982
Yes, hello?

164
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:51,651
Yes, you've called PD Note.

165
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:53,778
The sheer volume of the complaint calls

166
00:10:53,861 --> 00:10:56,364
were so high
that we couldn't do our daily work.

167
00:10:56,447 --> 00:11:01,702
They were threatening our families
or trying to intimidate us.

168
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:05,748
"Your husband is slandering my church
for no reason."

169
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:08,376
"You all will receive
the Lord's punishment for that."

170
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:13,547
MANMIN CENTRAL CHURCH

171
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:16,634
They believe in the rumors
that are being spread by those liars.

172
00:11:16,717 --> 00:11:18,678
They're trying to label us as a cult.

173
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:21,597
Even the media and broadcast stations

174
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:26,727
are all reporting on us,
so what in the world is going on?

175
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:29,355
It was when the two-week
revival meetings took place.

176
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:32,108
Because of the meetings,
there were many believers,

177
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:33,567
even though it was a Tuesday.

178
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:38,572
They were told that MBC was doing a report
on Manmin Central Church,

179
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:42,076
which was false,
so they should go and protest.

180
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:46,038
That the Church vehicles were outside,
so they should get on the vehicles.

181
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:49,667
They were large buses,
so I imagine they brought a lot of people.

182
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:00,761
The broadcast time was 11:00 p.m.,

183
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:04,807
but I think we got the final tape
around 10:40 p.m.

184
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:09,437
I was waiting anxiously
before receiving the tape around 10:45,

185
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:13,232
and I handed it off
to the control room around 10:50.

186
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:21,449
It doesn't take that long
to get to MBC from Guro-dong.

187
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:24,535
When I got there, I saw people

188
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:27,413
starting to gather
outside the walls around MBC.

189
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:32,334
They had parked at least five or six buses
in front of MBC.

190
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:35,755
I heard they got off the buses
and stormed in all at once.

191
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:38,716
They got into the building
along with the church employees.

192
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:45,556
LOBBY OF MBC BUILDING
ON THE DAY OF THE INDICENT

193
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:24,261
The logo and commercial went on air,
and the program started.

194
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:30,726
Then I heard people yelling.
We were on the fourth floor at the time.

195
00:13:32,728 --> 00:13:36,148
I could hear very loud screaming
from the fourth-floor hallway.

196
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:39,860
I took a look because I didn't know
what was going on, and all of a sudden,

197
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:43,280
these strange men ran into the office.

198
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:47,451
They were shouting my name and the names
of the other producers who worked on it,

199
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:49,203
yelling, "Get them!"

200
00:13:50,454 --> 00:13:54,124
That's when I got a call from my wife.

201
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:56,919
She was continuously receiving
threatening calls

202
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:59,630
since the morning,
even worse than the ones before.

203
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:00,923
She said she was scared.

204
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:05,469
My daughter was in kindergarten back then,
and there were threats against her too.

205
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:09,265
My wife asked me to hurry home
if I was done with everything.

206
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:13,018
So I took the elevator to the first floor,

207
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:14,979
and the place was packed with people.

208
00:14:29,785 --> 00:14:31,620
I honestly thought I might be killed

209
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:34,915
if I got caught by the riled-up believers.

210
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:40,170
They were shouting my name

211
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:42,840
and the names
of the other producers that worked on it,

212
00:14:42,923 --> 00:14:44,717
and I think they also had photos of us.

213
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,345
I went hiding
as I heard them looking for people.

214
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:50,055
It was really terrifying.

215
00:14:51,181 --> 00:14:53,642
I was thinking to myself,
"What on earth is going on?"

216
00:14:58,522 --> 00:15:00,608
-MBC!
-MBC!

217
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:02,860
-Must respect!
-Must respect!

218
00:15:02,943 --> 00:15:05,195
-People!
-People!

219
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:10,200
They were saying anyone slandering
their pastor like this is the Devil.

220
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:11,994
I was really worried for myself

221
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:15,122
as well as the crew members
who were still there.

222
00:15:18,792 --> 00:15:19,960
"You're Yoon, right?"

223
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:23,672
They were going to grab me by my collar
after calling me an evil bastard.

224
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:25,633
But the show was airing,

225
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:29,470
so they yelled, "Let's stop the broadcast.
Where is it? Where?"

226
00:15:29,553 --> 00:15:31,138
Then they ran to the control room.

227
00:15:31,221 --> 00:15:35,017
They said, "The show is being aired
from the control room on the second floor,

228
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:38,187
so we need to stop that."
That was quite specific and technical.

229
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:40,981
That's how well-prepared they were.

230
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:43,692
They planned everything out
and stormed in as a group.

231
00:15:45,152 --> 00:15:48,113
The control room
is a national security facility,

232
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:49,740
so there are multiple security measures.

233
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:52,910
Somebody inside has to verify
the person to open the door.

234
00:15:52,993 --> 00:15:55,120
That's why I don't understand

235
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:57,289
how they broke through that door.

236
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,795
They broke the door
and got into the control room,

237
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:06,757
where they grabbed the tape
that was airing out of the deck.

238
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:12,888
I thought they were like a militia.

239
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:16,183
The fact that there were hundreds
who stopped the broadcast…

240
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:18,143
You can't touch that!

241
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:20,604
Be quiet, seriously! Stay quiet.

242
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:23,399
We basically got into a brawl
with the church members.

243
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:26,610
And that's when the zebras
appeared on the screen.

244
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:33,075
How pathetic is it to just keep sitting
in front of that machine?

245
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:34,576
Who would do that because…

246
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:37,913
They'd often be hiding…

247
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,418
Who would…

248
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:45,129
They'd…

249
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:48,465
PD Note would play
whenever we managed to protect the tape.

250
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:55,431
Then when Manmin Central Church members
pressed the stop button,

251
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:56,598
the zebras would air.

252
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:00,102
Then we'd step in again
and the show would play.

253
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:02,521
That's how the broadcast was disrupted.

254
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:10,070
During the PD Note incident,
Manmin Central Church showed everybody

255
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:16,285
exactly why a religious group
would be called a cult and a fake one.

256
00:17:18,912 --> 00:17:20,748
MBC IS NOT OUR GOD

257
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:29,631
1999
THE MBC RAID

258
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:36,930
1943
THE BIRTH OF LEE JAE-ROCK

259
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:40,726
Lee Jae-rock was born in 1943,

260
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:44,521
in Muan, Jeollanam-do, as the youngest
of three boys and three girls.

261
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:50,861
SEOUL
MUAN

262
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:01,371
MUAN

263
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:03,832
It was a small house with a thatched roof.

264
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:04,875
Oh, a thatched hut?

265
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:07,795
Apparently, they lived
in that house over that way.

266
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:19,598
I heard that he was really clever
since he was young.

267
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:34,113
It was indeed heartbreaking for me.

268
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:38,242
So many faithful believers were scattered
in order to escape persecution.

269
00:18:38,325 --> 00:18:42,538
It seemed like the church,
the body of Christ, had been destroyed.

270
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:47,334
To Manmin Central Church members,
Muan Manmin Church is considered sacred.

271
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:50,212
That's why a lot of the members
visit there every year

272
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:52,756
as a sort of annual event of pilgrimage.

273
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:09,481
He served in the army after living
an ordinary life until high school.

274
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:12,484
Then, he met and married his current wife.

275
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:15,904
And they had three daughters.

276
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:18,448
So he was living an ordinary life.

277
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:20,492
Then one day, apparently,
he got very sick.

278
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:23,704
He had all different kinds of diseases.

279
00:19:23,787 --> 00:19:27,749
There wasn't a part of his body
which was healthy, you know.

280
00:19:32,045 --> 00:19:36,133
He suffered unbearable pain
for seven years,

281
00:19:36,216 --> 00:19:39,136
then he followed one of his relatives
to a house of prayer.

282
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:42,222
There, he experienced
"the laying on of hands."

283
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:44,683
Apparently, he was completely cured
after that.

284
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:49,479
But the interesting thing here is

285
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:52,941
that he claimed
he had heard the voice of the Lord.

286
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:55,652
All of this is in his autobiography.

287
00:19:55,736 --> 00:19:57,487
"It was 1975."

288
00:19:57,571 --> 00:20:01,074
"I went to the house of prayer
on Chilbosan in Suwon one early morning."

289
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:04,286
"I laid down a blanket
and was praying on my knees."

290
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:07,497
"That's when I first heard God's voice."

291
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:09,625
"He said, 'I shall always be with you.'"

292
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,919
"'You shall be my servant,
who tells the world

293
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:14,755
of my existence
through wonders and signs.'"

294
00:20:14,838 --> 00:20:16,924
1943
THE BIRTH OF LEE JAE-ROCK

295
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:20,135
1982
ESTABLISHMENT OF MANMIN CENTRAL CHURCH

296
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:21,720
MANMIN CENTRAL CHURCH

297
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:25,557
In the year 1982,
he established Manmin Central Church.

298
00:20:26,183 --> 00:20:31,230
That's when he decided
to start calling himself God.

299
00:20:31,813 --> 00:20:36,151
Initially, Manmin Central Church
did not really stand out.

300
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:38,278
And then, one day,

301
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:42,115
he began these "healing rallies"
to cure people of their illnesses,

302
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:46,536
for an entire week
on the second week of May every year.

303
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,205
Our Father!

304
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:05,472
God gave us wisdom and strength.

305
00:21:05,555 --> 00:21:09,226
God gave us everything that we have.

306
00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:12,813
When my older sister was born,
my mother was in a coma,

307
00:21:12,896 --> 00:21:16,900
and my sister was also in an incubator
because something was wrong with her.

308
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:19,569
That's when my father's sister said,

309
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:21,697
"There's this church that I go to."

310
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:25,450
"You should ask them to visit
and pray for you, as a last resort."

311
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:27,828
Then, as if by some miracle,
my mother got better

312
00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:29,788
and my sister also came home healthy.

313
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:36,420
I witnessed a lot of people getting cured
as a result of Lee Jae-rock's prayers.

314
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:38,839
There was a man
who fell from the fifth floor.

315
00:21:38,922 --> 00:21:43,051
He broke all of his ribs,
so he was brought there in an ambulance.

316
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:45,679
Lee Jae-rock said, "Let there be light,"
and asked God,

317
00:21:45,762 --> 00:21:49,057
while laying his hand on the man,
to drive away all sins with His light

318
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:50,309
and to heal the man.

319
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:52,853
Then he got to his feet
and started jumping around.

320
00:21:57,858 --> 00:22:01,611
I personally saw people who couldn't walk
getting to their feet and walking.

321
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:04,406
Also, a person in a wheelchair
being cured.

322
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:13,040
And patients who were told
they had stage-three lung or liver cancer,

323
00:22:13,123 --> 00:22:15,000
that they wouldn't live, were cured.

324
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:16,543
-Hallelujah.
-Amen.

325
00:22:16,626 --> 00:22:18,170
Were they actually cured?

326
00:22:18,253 --> 00:22:19,129
Yes.

327
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:24,593
Ever since the beginning of this church,
we've witnessed many wonders.

328
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:28,430
We saw numerous signs
and extraordinary abilities.

329
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:29,348
Amen.

330
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:32,476
Many dead came back to life
after receiving prayers,

331
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:36,313
those who were blind could see again,
mute people spoke, and deaf people heard.

332
00:22:36,396 --> 00:22:39,024
People got up from their wheelchairs
to run and walk,

333
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:40,942
and many others…

334
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:44,696
There are so many people
gathered here, God, our Father.

335
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:49,493
Pastor Lee prayed for all the patients
with all of his heart.

336
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:52,579
Even before his prayers ended,

337
00:22:52,662 --> 00:22:55,624
the healed believers began
to step forward to the podium

338
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:57,542
in order to give their testimonies.

339
00:22:57,626 --> 00:23:00,128
He said He'll be with us
until the very end.

340
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:05,801
The duration or severity of the illnesses
didn't matter at all.

341
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:11,681
The healing powers of God continued
even in the retreat afterward.

342
00:23:11,765 --> 00:23:14,142
Exorcism is a common practice
in Christianity.

343
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:18,897
The people possessed by ghosts
were going crazy.

344
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,607
What am I going to do?

345
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:21,942
He prayed for you, right?

346
00:23:22,025 --> 00:23:24,694
My goodness, what am I going to do?

347
00:23:24,778 --> 00:23:26,446
-Stop it! Be quiet.
-I have nowhere to go.

348
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:30,367
-Get out. He just prayed for you.
-I really have nowhere to go.

349
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:32,285
What does the evil spirit look like?

350
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:42,295
What does that crow inside of you
look like?

351
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:43,922
Say it.

352
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:47,384
Look me in the eyes.

353
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:49,970
When he prays for you, scream and leave.

354
00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:51,471
God, our Father.

355
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:54,724
Please drive out the Devil
and all foul things.

356
00:23:55,308 --> 00:23:57,394
Drive out everything that's inside of her.

357
00:23:57,477 --> 00:23:59,729
Protect us with Your Holy Spirit's
wall of fire.

358
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:02,441
It's time for you to leave. Now go.

359
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:08,155
Hallelujah. We give thanks to the Father
for healing her.

360
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:10,407
I love you, Shepherd.

361
00:24:11,533 --> 00:24:15,287
Of course. Live well and stay faithful.

362
00:24:16,329 --> 00:24:18,498
1982
ESTABLISHMENT OF MANMIN CENTRAL CHURCH

363
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:21,209
In 1991, Lee Jae-rock was dismissed

364
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:25,672
from his position as pastor
at Jesus Korea Sungkyul Church,

365
00:24:25,755 --> 00:24:28,008
the denomination
of which he had been a part.

366
00:24:28,091 --> 00:24:30,760
So technically, he's not a pastor.

367
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:35,182
The Bible says that you can see God
if your heart is pure.

368
00:24:35,265 --> 00:24:38,435
So why do people keep saying
it's wrong for me to say I've seen God?

369
00:24:38,518 --> 00:24:40,729
1991
THE DISMISSAL

370
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:43,440
1999
LABELED AS A CULT

371
00:24:43,523 --> 00:24:46,026
THE RESOLUTION FROM THE GENERAL MEETING
ON CULTS AND HERESY

372
00:24:46,109 --> 00:24:49,946
The Christian Council of Korea
defined him as a heretic.

373
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:51,364
The very last sentence says,

374
00:24:51,448 --> 00:24:54,284
"A terrifying heretic
who practices extremist mysticism."

375
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:56,244
That's how they defined him.

376
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:59,748
After that, however, he started

377
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:03,668
to develop the cult-like elements
even more liberally

378
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:06,796
and build his very own kingdom.

379
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:11,384
REVEALING 16 YEARS OF TRUTH
ABOUT PASTOR LEE JAE-ROCK

380
00:25:25,398 --> 00:25:28,443
MANMIN CENTRAL CHURCH

381
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:32,531
Where beautiful ones gather,

382
00:25:34,282 --> 00:25:38,328
God is looking over us.

383
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:47,462
Here comes the beautiful one,
the glorious shepherd of New Jerusalem.

384
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:21,997
PASTOR, MANMIN CENTRAL CHURCH

385
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:38,555
After the MBC incident,
Manmin grew even more

386
00:26:38,638 --> 00:26:40,015
and became even more unified.

387
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:41,975
There were some pastors and deacons

388
00:26:42,058 --> 00:26:45,645
who had broken cameras during their raid
on the broadcasting station.

389
00:26:46,938 --> 00:26:48,440
-Must respect!
-Must respect!

390
00:26:48,523 --> 00:26:50,483
-People!
-People!

391
00:26:54,154 --> 00:26:56,531
The others treated them
almost like heroes.

392
00:26:56,615 --> 00:27:00,160
I thought Manmin Central Church
was innocent at the time.

393
00:27:00,243 --> 00:27:02,829
We were bonded even stronger.
Even more so.

394
00:27:02,912 --> 00:27:04,456
After the show had aired,

395
00:27:04,539 --> 00:27:09,961
they filed lawsuits
very persistently and continuously.

396
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:12,464
For about six or seven years
after the broadcast,

397
00:27:13,214 --> 00:27:14,507
we were pulled into court.

398
00:27:15,091 --> 00:27:18,303
They bullied us with those lawsuits
for a very long time.

399
00:27:18,386 --> 00:27:22,015
PLAINTIFF/APPELLANT/APPELLEE
MUNHWA BROADCASTING CORPORATION

400
00:27:22,098 --> 00:27:23,600
MBC won the case.

401
00:27:23,683 --> 00:27:27,270
But even though MBC won in terms

402
00:27:27,354 --> 00:27:30,357
of damages and defamation,

403
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:37,280
Lee Jae-rock told everybody that MBC lost
and Manmin Central Church won.

404
00:27:37,364 --> 00:27:42,035
But I think this was a way for him
to unite his church members.

405
00:27:43,036 --> 00:27:46,623
Well, I heard that we won the case.

406
00:27:46,706 --> 00:27:47,624
Amen.

407
00:27:47,707 --> 00:27:50,377
But hearing things like that
doesn't make me happy,

408
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:52,045
even though I should be.

409
00:27:53,004 --> 00:27:55,382
I feel pretty calm and rather sad.

410
00:27:56,132 --> 00:27:58,259
I'm sad even though we won.

411
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:00,011
So, the media will report on us.

412
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:03,556
They'll report on me and our church again.

413
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,475
Even so, this makes me so sad.

414
00:28:06,726 --> 00:28:10,605
I'm sad this happened to me, but also sad
thinking about the other side's troubles.

415
00:28:11,439 --> 00:28:12,691
We love you!

416
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:16,778
Our beloved Pastor Lee
is now making his entrance.

417
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:21,074
Everyone, please give him a huge round
of applause and cheer as he enters!

418
00:28:21,157 --> 00:28:23,034
The treasure of all nations!

419
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:29,708
He shall be glorified
through all nations and our shepherd!

420
00:28:29,791 --> 00:28:32,961
Salute to Pastor Lee!

421
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:34,421
Manmin!

422
00:28:36,506 --> 00:28:37,340
Manmin!

423
00:28:44,597 --> 00:28:46,891
There are so many events
in Manmin Central Church.

424
00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:50,061
One of the most important ones
is Lee Jae-rock's birthday.

425
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:52,897
As far as I know,
they spend more than 500 million won.

426
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:54,649
With flashy stage decorations,

427
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:57,944
external companies are hired too,
including a filming team.

428
00:28:58,445 --> 00:28:59,738
It's quite a spectacle.

429
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:05,994
2017 "CAMPFIRE"

430
00:29:35,815 --> 00:29:39,235
Once, he even preached
at Madison Square Garden in New York.

431
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:42,489
Only if you receive the prayer by faith,
I firmly believe

432
00:29:42,572 --> 00:29:44,365
that God will wonderfully bless you.

433
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:52,081
Please lay your hands on the people here.

434
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:53,917
Power, power.

435
00:29:56,211 --> 00:29:57,462
That's all he can do.

436
00:29:57,545 --> 00:30:00,548
He puts on a show,
pretending he's healing the sick.

437
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:04,302
He just reenacted the same thing
he was doing here.

438
00:30:04,385 --> 00:30:07,514
Then they would say,
"Lee Jae-rock is so popular overseas."

439
00:30:07,597 --> 00:30:11,643
"He's healing a lot of people there too."
That's how they advertise it in Korea.

440
00:30:11,726 --> 00:30:13,186
Everywhere I go…

441
00:30:13,269 --> 00:30:15,146
Just as Pastor Lee said,

442
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:20,985
the audience could see proof
that God is alive.

443
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:24,697
And at the great assembly
in Pakistan in 2000,

444
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:28,243
where he awakened so many
with his amazing healing powers,

445
00:30:29,285 --> 00:30:32,831
he proved that Our Father
is with our church.

446
00:30:38,127 --> 00:30:40,964
"Our shepherd's powers
are growing day by day."

447
00:30:41,548 --> 00:30:43,842
"He's becoming even greater,
even more amazing."

448
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:48,513
As he was acting more passionately,
perhaps he fooled himself of it too.

449
00:30:48,596 --> 00:30:52,308
He even said that every single wonder
that happened in the world

450
00:30:52,392 --> 00:30:54,143
was because of him.

451
00:30:54,227 --> 00:30:58,439
So, for example, if there was a rainbow,
he'd say that he created it.

452
00:30:59,107 --> 00:31:01,025
Wow, it's amazing.

453
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:03,069
What a beautiful rainbow.

454
00:31:03,778 --> 00:31:04,654
Hallelujah.

455
00:31:05,405 --> 00:31:06,781
It's a perfect rainbow.

456
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:08,825
Thank you, my shepherd's Lord!

457
00:31:09,909 --> 00:31:11,494
Thank you, Father.

458
00:31:12,579 --> 00:31:16,332
If a dragonfly landed on his shoulder,
he said it was because he's God.

459
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:22,839
Not one, but multiple dragonflies
are sitting on multiple parts of the body.

460
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:25,008
What shocked me the most

461
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:26,384
was the hurricane.

462
00:31:26,467 --> 00:31:29,470
There was this hurricane
in the United States,

463
00:31:30,013 --> 00:31:32,307
and he claimed
that it went away after he prayed.

464
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:34,100
The powerful hurricane Irma

465
00:31:34,183 --> 00:31:38,146
landed in the United States
with strong winds of 210 km/h.

466
00:31:50,283 --> 00:31:52,577
Our Father, God of Hosts.

467
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:54,454
Your son is praying to you.

468
00:31:54,537 --> 00:31:59,500
Please put this hurricane to rest
so that it can disappear.

469
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:04,255
He shows you that the hurricane has been
reported to be lowered in its category.

470
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:09,469
The weather itself obeyed him exactly
as he had prayed.

471
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:16,184
So, he made it sound
like climate change and natural phenomena

472
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:18,937
had occurred because of his prayers.

473
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:23,900
2017
THE SPIRIT'S PARTY

474
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:42,543
May 3rd is the day of the Spirit's Party
we've been longing for.

475
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:47,548
So the Spirit's Party
is where people gather

476
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:50,176
because God is supposed to be visiting.

477
00:32:50,259 --> 00:32:52,929
There were times
when they even enacted God's visit.

478
00:32:58,267 --> 00:33:00,853
Oh, our Father is about to appear.

479
00:33:02,021 --> 00:33:04,023
Yes. He is descending.

480
00:33:04,107 --> 00:33:05,316
He's coming down.

481
00:33:08,111 --> 00:33:10,154
It was a show to prove God's presence.

482
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:12,699
It was the epitome of deification.

483
00:33:12,782 --> 00:33:14,951
It's a joke. That's what it is.

484
00:33:15,034 --> 00:33:17,370
God shows up when He is summoned.

485
00:33:17,453 --> 00:33:19,414
And the spirits in Heaven also show up.

486
00:33:19,497 --> 00:33:21,040
He'd walk around with them

487
00:33:21,124 --> 00:33:23,001
and look around.

488
00:33:24,544 --> 00:33:26,212
When Pastor Lee starts walking,

489
00:33:26,295 --> 00:33:28,256
our God, the Father, will be on his right

490
00:33:29,048 --> 00:33:33,136
and Jesus on his left,
walking together by his side.

491
00:33:34,929 --> 00:33:37,223
God says He missed you so much.

492
00:33:38,975 --> 00:33:40,268
He's crying right now.

493
00:33:51,988 --> 00:33:53,656
The funny thing about Pastor Lee

494
00:33:54,657 --> 00:33:58,119
is that he makes these "characters"
around him.

495
00:33:58,202 --> 00:33:59,829
He has these supporting actors

496
00:34:00,663 --> 00:34:02,040
to deify himself.

497
00:34:02,123 --> 00:34:04,751
He surrounds himself
with those who speak on his behalf,

498
00:34:05,251 --> 00:34:07,295
like writing a solid scenario.

499
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:10,381
Pastor Lee's eyes and mouth look
almost identical to God's.

500
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:13,718
His hair is long,
and he is surrounded by light.

501
00:34:13,801 --> 00:34:16,721
He showed me the hand of God, the Father.

502
00:34:16,804 --> 00:34:19,849
His fingers are thick,

503
00:34:19,932 --> 00:34:21,893
and His hands are big.

504
00:34:21,976 --> 00:34:25,772
I saw Shepherd's hands earlier,
and they look just like God's.

505
00:34:25,855 --> 00:34:27,899
The face of God, the Father,

506
00:34:27,982 --> 00:34:30,568
resembles the face of Pastor Lee so much.

507
00:34:30,651 --> 00:34:32,862
I don't think
I'll be able to sleep at night.

508
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:41,120
"Because you have given me
so many spiritual children,

509
00:34:41,204 --> 00:34:44,040
I am no longer lonely."

510
00:34:44,123 --> 00:34:45,833
"I'm so happy I have many people

511
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:50,755
who know how I feel
and who I can share my feelings with."

512
00:34:50,838 --> 00:34:53,549
That was the message sent by God.

513
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,596
He said,
"How could I not come given all of this?"

514
00:34:58,679 --> 00:35:02,100
"How could I turn down
such an invitation?"

515
00:35:02,183 --> 00:35:06,771
I've heard Him tell me those things.

516
00:35:11,651 --> 00:35:12,610
Father.

517
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:16,739
We'll begin the feast now.

518
00:35:16,823 --> 00:35:18,282
God just laughed loudly.

519
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:21,744
Yes, Lord said that you are so beautiful

520
00:35:21,828 --> 00:35:25,581
and that He just heard
all of your confessions.

521
00:35:25,665 --> 00:35:27,625
Our beloved Father!

522
00:35:27,708 --> 00:35:30,169
We've been longing to see you so much!

523
00:35:30,253 --> 00:35:32,630
Thank you. We love you!

524
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:37,343
He would get these three chairs
to represent the Holy Trinity

525
00:35:37,426 --> 00:35:38,970
and take a seat in one of them.

526
00:35:39,053 --> 00:35:40,513
So it was really…

527
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:43,766
It was an incredibly clever show.

528
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:47,687
People saw two seats
for the Father and the Son,

529
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:50,106
and Pastor Lee was sitting
right next to them.

530
00:35:50,189 --> 00:35:51,190
What does that mean?

531
00:35:51,274 --> 00:35:53,317
Naturally, that would lead
to a conclusion.

532
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:57,822
They would say
that God wants to see another Christ.

533
00:35:57,905 --> 00:35:59,782
Lee Jae-rock will say this then.

534
00:35:59,866 --> 00:36:02,451
"Another Christ here is referring to me."

535
00:36:04,203 --> 00:36:07,039
"I really want to see
our Father in Heaven."

536
00:36:07,874 --> 00:36:11,878
"I really want to see
our other Christ too."

537
00:36:12,378 --> 00:36:13,880
Does it say, "our other Christ"?

538
00:36:13,963 --> 00:36:15,756
-Yes. "The Holy Spirit."
-What?

539
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:18,134
"I want to meet the Holy Spirit too."

540
00:36:18,801 --> 00:36:20,928
You know, that's referring to me.

541
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:23,055
He wants to see me.

542
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:27,727
They were always looking for hidden shapes
in Manmin Central Church.

543
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:29,854
The most notable one
was studying the walls.

544
00:36:29,937 --> 00:36:34,108
You know, they were looking for shapes
in the smudges on the walls.

545
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:35,318
He's here too.

546
00:36:38,154 --> 00:36:39,363
He's right here too.

547
00:36:40,323 --> 00:36:41,490
Can you see it?

548
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:46,412
Look, he's clearly right here too.

549
00:36:46,495 --> 00:36:47,622
Yes, he's here too.

550
00:36:47,705 --> 00:36:49,081
And look, right here.

551
00:36:49,165 --> 00:36:50,625
-Amen!
-Amen!

552
00:36:53,586 --> 00:36:55,713
His face would be right on the moon.

553
00:36:56,297 --> 00:36:58,341
His face was in the sun too.

554
00:36:58,925 --> 00:37:02,428
MOON GAZING

555
00:37:03,262 --> 00:37:07,475
You all saw me on the moon before, right?

556
00:37:07,558 --> 00:37:08,726
Amen!

557
00:37:08,809 --> 00:37:10,019
At the last moment,

558
00:37:11,312 --> 00:37:17,485
why do you think that God put my face
on the moon and the sun?

559
00:37:18,277 --> 00:37:20,905
Just think about it. Why did He?

560
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:23,449
What kind of person am I

561
00:37:23,532 --> 00:37:29,997
that God of Hosts put my face
on the moon and the sun?

562
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:32,708
You all saw it too, right?

563
00:37:34,168 --> 00:37:36,796
It's an angel spreading its wings.

564
00:37:36,879 --> 00:37:38,297
Did you look for me too?

565
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:42,134
You all now know why I'm in this image,

566
00:37:42,218 --> 00:37:46,931
why you can see me
in the wings of the angel.

567
00:37:47,014 --> 00:37:48,349
-Amen!
-Where am I?

568
00:37:48,432 --> 00:37:51,936
Isn't my figure clearly inside that angel?

569
00:37:52,019 --> 00:37:53,062
Amen!

570
00:37:53,145 --> 00:37:54,647
If you can see me, please say so.

571
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:56,065
Amen!

572
00:37:56,857 --> 00:37:59,568
You can clearly see me, right?

573
00:37:59,652 --> 00:38:00,861
Amen!

574
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:03,197
You know why I'm in there.

575
00:38:04,365 --> 00:38:09,078
You know exactly how I have so much power.

576
00:38:11,205 --> 00:38:13,499
Well, you can see anything if you try to.

577
00:38:15,209 --> 00:38:19,171
I can find him right away as I've seen
so many pictures like this one.

578
00:38:19,255 --> 00:38:23,426
I know exactly what he means
by "the shape of Lee Jae-rock,"

579
00:38:23,509 --> 00:38:26,929
so I can find it quickly,
which is why it makes me sad.

580
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:30,182
I still see his face
when I look at the moon.

581
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:44,238
I still remember the day

582
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:46,282
when I heard about what happened.

583
00:38:48,451 --> 00:38:50,369
Well, it was just unbelievable.

584
00:38:50,453 --> 00:38:53,122
I was like,
"Something like this couldn't happen."

585
00:38:53,205 --> 00:38:55,583
I mean, who could have imagined?

586
00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:59,378
He started unclasping my bra.

587
00:38:59,462 --> 00:39:03,716
I was surprised
because he was so good at it.

588
00:39:04,383 --> 00:39:06,385
"Who does your ***** belong to,
Jeong-hye?"

589
00:39:06,969 --> 00:39:10,181
He examines that "part" very closely.

590
00:39:11,474 --> 00:39:12,975
He just keeps staring at it.

591
00:39:15,227 --> 00:39:16,896
While we were having intercourse,

592
00:39:17,396 --> 00:39:19,815
he kept asking me if it felt good.

593
00:39:21,484 --> 00:39:23,402
And he kept telling me to moan.

594
00:39:23,486 --> 00:39:25,404
He was like, "Do you like that? Do you?"

595
00:39:34,413 --> 00:39:35,790
