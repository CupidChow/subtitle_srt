00:00:06,047 --> 00:00:10,677
THE FOLLOWING EPISODE CONTAINS
DESCRIPTIONS OF CHILD ABUSE

2
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:13,930
WHICH MAY BE DISTURBING TO SOME VIEWERS

3
00:00:26,776 --> 00:00:28,194
Please introduce yourself.

4
00:00:28,903 --> 00:00:33,491
I'm the heartless woman
who caused a racket

5
00:00:33,575 --> 00:00:37,328
during the Baby Garden incident in 1996.

6
00:00:37,412 --> 00:00:40,081
I am Sun Yeong-re, Nak-gwi's mother.

7
00:00:58,266 --> 00:00:59,559
I'm a freak.

8
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:04,564
I'm a lunatic and an insane woman as well.

9
00:01:14,949 --> 00:01:17,494
Because Nak-gwi had really fair skin,

10
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:20,080
many people called him cute and pretty.

11
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:21,873
He received a lot of love.

12
00:01:22,832 --> 00:01:27,295
When I was hearing about this incident,
one of the biggest questions I had was,

13
00:01:27,378 --> 00:01:29,756
"Who on earth was Nak-gwi's mother?"

14
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:33,426
Well…

15
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:38,389
I can't call myself a mother.
I can't say the word "mother."

16
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:43,061
I'm such a horrible bitch like this.
So horrible!

17
00:01:43,144 --> 00:01:46,689
I wish somebody
would just stone me to death.

18
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:48,733
I'm a really horrible bitch.

19
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:52,320
I truly don't deserve to live!

20
00:01:52,403 --> 00:01:54,114
Stop. Please stop it.

21
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:57,867
Oh, I'm such a horrible bitch.

22
00:02:06,042 --> 00:02:09,170
I just can't forgive myself.

23
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:16,511
Religious cult issues have reemerged
after a period of silence.

24
00:02:16,594 --> 00:02:19,681
The prosecution has arrested
four executive members of a cult,

25
00:02:19,764 --> 00:02:23,852
who created a cult called the Baby Garden
to steal the believers' assets

26
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:27,438
and killed three believers
who didn't follow the leader.

27
00:02:28,022 --> 00:02:31,317
The leader, Kim Ki-soon, and others
created a cult group

28
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:35,155
and deceived people by telling them,
"I'll give you eternal life,"

29
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:37,073
and "I'll create Heaven on Earth."

30
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:40,118
Leader Kim Ki-soon deified herself

31
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:43,329
and brutally assaulted followers
who did not follow her.

32
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:46,958
A SEVEN-YEAR-OLD BOY, CHOI NAK-GWI,

33
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:49,252
STARVED FOR ONE WEEK
AND WAS BEATEN UP IN A PIGPEN

34
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:53,882
CHANGED HIS NAME FROM NAK-WON TO NAK-GWI
AS "HE WAS POSSESSED BY AN EVIL SPIRIT"

35
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:56,259
TIED UP IN A PIGPEN AND FED HUMAN WASTE

36
00:02:56,342 --> 00:03:00,013
Nak-gwi, the seven-year-old son
of 40-year-old believer Choi Myeong-ho,

37
00:03:00,096 --> 00:03:03,892
was locked up in a pigpen
and beaten to death in 1987.

38
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:11,941
The mistake had already been made.

39
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:18,239
I'm so ashamed that I'm still alive.

40
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:56,152
IN THE NAME OF GOD: A HOLY BETRAYAL

41
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:03,117
THE BABY GARDEN, ON THE WAY TO THE HEAVEN

42
00:04:18,132 --> 00:04:22,178
ICHEON

43
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:31,437
ARIRANG WORLD

44
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,818
SYNNARA

45
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:45,034
Come out when you're done.

46
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:49,497
Hey, wait a minute.

47
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,583
You need to hand it over
and then come out.

48
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:56,421
I don't want to watch it.

49
00:04:56,504 --> 00:04:59,299
I didn't know
they did such bad things to the kid.

50
00:04:59,882 --> 00:05:03,344
I was just following Kim Ki-soon's orders.

51
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:05,805
I didn't know anything
that happened after that.

52
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:09,142
Hearing the story like this,

53
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:11,394
it breaks my heart.

54
00:05:12,603 --> 00:05:16,357
CHOI NAK-GWI
5 YEARS OLD AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT

55
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:22,238
My name is Sun Bok-re, Nak-gwi's aunt.

56
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:26,117
Regarding the death
of my nephew, Choi Nak-gwi,

57
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:30,455
I admit that I'm the murderer.

58
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:41,007
1987
NAK-GWI'S DEATH

59
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:45,553
It was summer.

60
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:50,016
Back then, I was working at a factory.

61
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:52,769
It was in the afternoon,
and my shift was almost over.

62
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:55,605
I got a call saying
that Kim Ki-soon wanted to see me.

63
00:06:05,406 --> 00:06:08,284
She called me there,
and I sat by her feet.

64
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:13,206
She said that Nak-gwi had pooped
and smeared it all over the walls.

65
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:16,834
And that he was possessed by a spirit.

66
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:21,756
She said,
"We need to discipline your nephew,

67
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:25,218
but his mother is at work,
and his father is gone."

68
00:06:25,301 --> 00:06:26,677
"So, in his mother's place,

69
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:28,513
you need to beat him."

70
00:06:29,263 --> 00:06:34,435
I went to the pigpen
as she told me Nak-gwi was there.

71
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,105
When I got there,

72
00:06:37,688 --> 00:06:40,441
they had taken all of his clothes off,

73
00:06:41,275 --> 00:06:44,779
and they had tied his hands
behind his back as if he's a sinner.

74
00:06:44,862 --> 00:06:46,948
They had him tied up to the pigpen.

75
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:52,286
People had followed me there to see

76
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:54,664
if I would do as I was told,

77
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:57,375
so I couldn't leave that place.

78
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,587
I did what Kim Ki-soon told me to do,
as I had no choice.

79
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:05,007
At the time, I went to beat him up too.

80
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:08,094
I was brushing my teeth
after lunch, and suddenly,

81
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:09,929
people were looking for me outside.

82
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:14,016
They said,
"Nak-gwi has been possessed by Satan."

83
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:17,645
"Agaya said we can't let the devil be."

84
00:07:18,187 --> 00:07:19,147
So I followed them.

85
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:22,108
"Why don't you try some poop too?"

86
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:23,985
I kneaded it with my hands

87
00:07:24,068 --> 00:07:26,737
and put it in his mouth a couple of times.

88
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:31,242
Then Nak-gwi pushed it out
with his tongue.

89
00:07:31,325 --> 00:07:33,536
He pushed it out with his tongue twice.

90
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:36,038
Then we were told

91
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:39,292
to grab a stick,
form in a line in order, and beat him.

92
00:07:45,381 --> 00:07:47,091
I realized, as I was hitting him,

93
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:51,053
that there must've been nails embedded
in the stick I was beating him with.

94
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:52,722
It looked like he was bleeding.

95
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:56,642
After I saw that blood,

96
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:58,895
I tossed the stick aside and just left.

97
00:08:00,062 --> 00:08:03,900
Any other kid
might have cried out, "Auntie!"

98
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:07,737
They would have said something.
But he didn't say anything.

99
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:10,198
I hit him a few times.
There was a line behind me.

100
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:12,074
We took turns beating him.

101
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:13,910
We were saying, "Leave him, Satan!"

102
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:17,205
"How dare you come here?"
Then we just kept beating him.

103
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:21,375
SIX DAYS BEFORE NAK-GWI'S DEATH

104
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:26,923
AUGUST 8, 1987
THE BABY GARDEN, ICHEON

105
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:35,932
From my memory,
it was during a summer break.

106
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:40,061
I'm not sure
what I did wrong exactly at the time,

107
00:08:40,144 --> 00:08:42,355
but I remember being told
I was worse than a pig,

108
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:44,941
and I lived in that pigpen
the entire summer break.

109
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:48,819
Nak-won was already there when I went.

110
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:50,196
NAK-WON: NAK-GWI'S ORIGINAL NAME

111
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:51,197
He was tied up.

112
00:08:55,117 --> 00:08:56,869
What really sickened me

113
00:08:57,578 --> 00:08:59,830
was that they didn't give him
any food at all.

114
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:01,499
Not even water.

115
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:06,629
So, there was a tap that pigs drank from.
You had to press it to get water from it.

116
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:09,715
So I gathered the water in my hands

117
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:13,427
and helped Nak-won drink a few small sips.

118
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:26,732
He was there for less than ten days,
but at least a week.

119
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:29,151
One night, he came up to the dining room,

120
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:31,112
still tied up, saying he was hungry.

121
00:09:31,195 --> 00:09:34,740
Apparently, he went in there
and said, "Ma'am, I'm hungry."

122
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:37,994
It's quite far away, even for an adult.

123
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:42,290
PIGPEN, DINING ROOM

124
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:45,626
He was probably hoping
that there would be some food left.

125
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:49,463
I mean, he must've been starving
to run all the way there, you know?

126
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:53,718
Well, someone went straight
to Kim Ki-soon, saying, "Agaya."

127
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:56,929
"I think Nak-gwi
is really possessed by a spirit."

128
00:09:57,555 --> 00:09:59,307
"He hasn't had anything to eat,

129
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:03,019
but he still had the strength
to run all the way here while tied up."

130
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:06,731
So they immediately took him back
and tied him up.

131
00:10:07,523 --> 00:10:08,941
They just tied him back up

132
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:11,861
without giving him a sip of water,
and when I heard that…

133
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:14,113
I was so…

134
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:25,249
A day or two later, Kim Ki-soon came in,

135
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:26,959
and though he couldn't even cry,

136
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:28,878
she beat him up again.

137
00:10:30,087 --> 00:10:31,297
She hit him. I saw it.

138
00:10:31,922 --> 00:10:34,050
I clearly saw it
right in front of my eyes.

139
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:40,264
She was hitting him,
but he couldn't even scream.

140
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:42,933
He was hit so many times.

141
00:10:43,934 --> 00:10:46,812
He should have been screaming in pain,

142
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:48,522
but he just couldn't.

143
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:57,448
But he had his eyes wide open.
I remember that.

144
00:10:58,115 --> 00:11:01,369
He wasn't glaring fiercely at her
or anything though.

145
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:04,330
He was just a baby.
He was an innocent baby.

146
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:09,377
It looked like he didn't even know
why he was there.

147
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:14,006
Afterwards, Nak-won left the pigpen
to go somewhere.

148
00:11:17,551 --> 00:11:22,223
I thought, "I have to remember this day,"

149
00:11:22,306 --> 00:11:24,058
and saw that it was raining so hard.

150
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:27,561
Then I saw my nephew's shoes
outside the women's bathroom.

151
00:11:28,145 --> 00:11:30,356
But the moment I saw those shoes,

152
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:32,942
I just couldn't believe
that my nephew had died.

153
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:48,040
When that was happening,
I was working at the market.

154
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:53,170
I found out about it
the day after he died.

155
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:56,799
So Kim Ki-soon told me
to come and see her.

156
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:58,592
AUGUST 15, 1987

157
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:02,596
She said, "Nak-gwi is gone. He's dead."

158
00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:07,893
"When he died, his face looked
like a cat's that was twisted."

159
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:12,314
"I need somebody to be a scapegoat
to teach people a lesson."

160
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:15,943
"And the other parents are very faithful."

161
00:12:16,026 --> 00:12:20,072
"Since your family joined last
and lacks faith,

162
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:24,201
it'll be hard for you to continue here
without sacrificing Nak-gwi."

163
00:12:25,202 --> 00:12:28,956
"But instead, because of the sacrifice
of Nak-gwi's soul,

164
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:31,667
you will now receive
the blessing of Heaven,

165
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:33,461
so be cooperative on this matter."

166
00:12:34,962 --> 00:12:36,714
"You just have to do as told."

167
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:41,260
1987
NAK-GWI'S DEATH

168
00:12:43,804 --> 00:12:47,266
1978
THE RISE OF KIM KI-SOON

169
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:51,604
Kim Ki-soon was found to be
a disciple of Pastor Lee,

170
00:12:51,687 --> 00:12:54,940
who caused a stir in the late '70s
for dancing naked

171
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:57,985
as a worship ritual in Iri, Jeonbuk.

172
00:12:58,068 --> 00:13:00,196
Kim's worship ritual
of singing popular songs

173
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:02,615
while wearing thin, see-through pajamas

174
00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:05,785
seemed to be influenced by Pastor Lee.

175
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:08,746
Lee Kyo-bu was in ministry

176
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:13,918
in Iri, Jeonbuk, during the 1970s.

177
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:20,466
He mainly taught a life
of integrity, sacrifice, and morality.

178
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:24,011
Lee Kyo-bu had about 1,000 believers
who followed him.

179
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:31,227
If that woman called Kim Ki-soon
creates the heavenly kingdom of Synnara,

180
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:33,687
then I'll go there, so…

181
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:38,108
I guess you could say
that this woman called Kim Ki-soon

182
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:42,071
was one of the followers
who used to be a part of my church.

183
00:13:42,696 --> 00:13:47,910
She said, "I respect you
just as much as Jesus."

184
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:50,287
She said she would follow me.

185
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:53,791
Even the others could see
that she was such a person.

186
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:58,879
She lost her parents
when she was very young.

187
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:01,131
She was poor, but she studied

188
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:04,343
and wanted to achieve
a lot of glory and honor.

189
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:07,680
But after she married the son of a pastor

190
00:14:07,763 --> 00:14:09,139
and gave birth to a son,

191
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:12,101
she couldn't achieve her dream.

192
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:18,107
I think she had a lot of regrets
about that.

193
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:22,736
But then, one day,
people started following Kim Ki-soon

194
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:25,656
instead of Lee Kyo-bu.

195
00:14:25,739 --> 00:14:28,534
Initially, I didn't go there
for Kim Ki-soon.

196
00:14:28,617 --> 00:14:30,744
Lee Kyo-bu seemed like somebody

197
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:35,708
who lived a pure life
and set a good example for other people.

198
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:40,588
I followed Mr. Lee Kyo-bu
and liked listening to his teachings, but…

199
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:43,507
WORSHIPPING NAKED, CULT PASTOR ARRESTED
LOCKED UP AND BEAT EIGHT PEOPLE

200
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:46,468
But I had to go to jail
for two years and six months.

201
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:52,558
After that incident,
Mr. Lee Kyo-bu went to jail.

202
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:58,147
Kim Ki-soon then appeared
and started preaching in his place.

203
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:01,609
So people thought
that the spirit had moved on to her.

204
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:05,571
Kim Ki-soon realized
that if she used the name, my name,

205
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:09,783
those people would go into the fire pit
even if it meant their death.

206
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:11,869
She finally realized this.

207
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:17,750
It wasn't very hard for Kim Ki-soon
to convert Lee Kyo-bu's followers to hers.

208
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:21,170
She said that she had gone
to visit Lee Kyo-bu in prison,

209
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:25,966
and he asked her
to take care of his followers.

210
00:15:27,217 --> 00:15:30,679
She told us a story

211
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:33,891
about visiting Lee Kyo-bu in jail.

212
00:15:33,974 --> 00:15:37,770
She said that he had asked her

213
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:40,606
to take care of us,
lead us, and reunite us.

214
00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:45,194
She said, "Kyo-bu is like a matchmaker
who matched me with you."

215
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:48,989
"He's like John the Baptist
of the old days."

216
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:52,618
"But now that I'm here,
you must follow me."

217
00:15:52,701 --> 00:15:55,412
And that was the beginning
of Kim Ki-soon's world.

218
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:59,208
Kim Ki-soon became the leader
in Lee Kyo-bu's place,

219
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:02,419
and she named herself "Agaya."

220
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:11,053
"My name is Agaya.
I'm a three-year-old baby."

221
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:13,555
"Because you have to be a child
to go to this world."

222
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:16,183
Even when we sang popular songs,
we sang them for Agaya.

223
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:18,394
When we sang hymns,
we sang them for Agaya.

224
00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:25,818
O, great and amazing peace

225
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:33,993
It is a gift from Agaya

226
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,162
It was first called the Garden of Eden,

227
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:39,415
and it was changed
to the Baby Garden later.

228
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:42,918
1978
THE RISE OF KIM KI-SOON

229
00:16:44,628 --> 00:16:48,382
1982
THE BEGINNING OF THE BABY GARDEN

230
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:53,762
THE BABY GARDEN, ICHEON, GYEONGGI-DO

231
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:09,111
She said, "I'll create Heaven on Earth."

232
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:13,157
She also said, "We're all brothers
and sisters. We're all one family."

233
00:17:13,657 --> 00:17:14,616
We were like that.

234
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,953
We lived in our own homes at first,
then started to live communally.

235
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:20,539
Kim Ki-soon told them
that the apocalypse is coming

236
00:17:20,622 --> 00:17:24,626
and duped them into believing
that only her followers would be allowed

237
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:28,589
into the millennial kingdom,
or, in other words, the Baby Garden.

238
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:36,263
She said, "Only the chosen few
may enter that kingdom."

239
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:41,602
And that's how 300 or 400 people
began living communally.

240
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:49,735
You will come to realize
what love really is.

241
00:17:49,818 --> 00:17:51,904
Many people around us say

242
00:17:51,987 --> 00:17:54,239
that this is love, and that is love.

243
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:56,700
That's just proof of that.

244
00:17:56,784 --> 00:18:00,037
At the time, Kim Ki-soon
had created a peculiar doctrine.

245
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,498
It was a doctrine called "Love."

246
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:05,626
"To enter the millennial kingdom,
or the millennial world,

247
00:18:05,709 --> 00:18:09,088
where you can live eternally,
you must love."

248
00:18:09,713 --> 00:18:11,715
Now, I will open the door of love.

249
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:14,760
She emphasized love
and said that God is love.

250
00:18:14,843 --> 00:18:18,347
People totally fell for it
because she was saying things like that.

251
00:18:24,728 --> 00:18:27,689
I thought Heaven on Earth
was going to come.

252
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:29,566
I lived there thinking it was Heaven.

253
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:31,485
I thought everyone who lived there

254
00:18:31,568 --> 00:18:35,322
would never die and live eternally.

255
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:39,368
THEY ALWAYS SAID I'LL BE ABLE
TO LIVE HAPPILY EVER AFTER

256
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:41,286
WITH THE PEOPLE I LOVE
WHEN THE WORLD ENDS,

257
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:42,788
SO I STARTED FALLING INTO IT MORE.

258
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:45,207
KIM KI-SOON TOLD US
THAT HIGHLY EDUCATED PEOPLE

259
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:46,875
LIKE PROFESSORS AND DOCTORS

260
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:49,294
WOULD KNEEL BEFORE US
AND SERVE US LIKE WE'RE KINGS

261
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:54,049
The door of love has opened

262
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:57,970
It has opened

263
00:18:58,053 --> 00:19:02,724
Chase

264
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:07,187
Love

265
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:11,608
We need to love! We must love!

266
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:16,238
My sisters, brothers, and compatriots
who are wearing these ceremonial robes.

267
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:18,699
My sisters and brothers
who received Agaya's blood.

268
00:19:18,782 --> 00:19:19,700
That's me.

269
00:19:19,783 --> 00:19:21,535
Now, every single person, this love…

270
00:19:21,618 --> 00:19:25,330
Agaya, please allow us to love.

271
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:28,208
She was my God and my Heaven.
My God, my Lord.

272
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:30,711
I believed her
to be the Second Coming of Christ.

273
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:35,799
OUR AGAYA WHO ART IN HEAVEN,
HALLOWED BE THY NAME

274
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:38,594
THY KINGDOM COME, THY WILL BE DONE
ON EARTH AS IT IS IN HEAVEN

275
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:42,222
To Agaya, the King of Love.

276
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:50,731
We offer you glory and praise,
our King of Love.

277
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:56,862
We dedicate our laughter, singing,
and dancing to you.

278
00:20:11,793 --> 00:20:12,794
It's how humans are.

279
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:16,924
When you see someone as mighty
as if they were God,

280
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:19,676
everything to do with them
seems beautiful and lovely.

281
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:27,684
We all thought she was God,
so everything about her seemed beautiful.

282
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:32,606
That's why I danced so much too.

283
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:33,565
With Kim Ki-soon?

284
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:37,986
Yes, I'm the one
who danced the blues with her the most.

285
00:21:06,473 --> 00:21:10,435
We will become your eternal source of joy.

286
00:21:11,895 --> 00:21:16,566
Agaya, you are so beautiful.

287
00:21:19,736 --> 00:21:23,657
Kim Ki-soon told her followers
to go out and make money.

288
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:26,118
She said, "We must build
the millennial kingdom here."

289
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:27,494
So she needed money.

290
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:32,291
We were very enthusiastic about it.

291
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:35,585
We didn't have much at the time.

292
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:39,840
The people who had more
would sell their belongings and share.

293
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:42,759
Everybody who went to live there

294
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:46,638
gave her their money when they joined.

295
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:51,393
In the '80s, I also took out
three million won from my security deposit

296
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:52,436
and gave it to her.

297
00:21:53,895 --> 00:21:55,981
The price of the land was 18 million won,

298
00:21:56,064 --> 00:21:58,984
and 40 bags of rice were needed
for the house.

299
00:21:59,067 --> 00:22:00,819
And I gave her 20 million won.

300
00:22:01,528 --> 00:22:04,614
I just wanted to give her
everything that I had.

301
00:22:04,698 --> 00:22:07,951
But we didn't have any money.

302
00:22:08,035 --> 00:22:10,162
My husband's family was very poor too.

303
00:22:10,245 --> 00:22:12,414
Because we didn't bring any money,

304
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:14,916
she told us to make it up with our bodies.

305
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,670
So we had to get up early in the morning
to go out and sell fish cakes,

306
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:22,758
prepare and sell lunchboxes,
and sell gimbap.

307
00:22:24,092 --> 00:22:27,804
Back then, we went to work
even if it was pouring rain.

308
00:22:28,388 --> 00:22:30,766
We never skipped a single day going.

309
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:36,438
In any case, I don't think
I could have worked harder than that.

310
00:22:38,398 --> 00:22:41,193
In the beginning,
there were about 300 members

311
00:22:41,276 --> 00:22:44,821
who were doing everything
from fixing rubber basins

312
00:22:45,405 --> 00:22:50,702
to waking up early in the morning
to sell tempura, rice cakes, and gimbap.

313
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:52,954
I could barely sleep.

314
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:59,544
"Sticky rice cakes!"

315
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:03,173
"Buckwheat jelly!"

316
00:23:03,256 --> 00:23:07,177
During the quiet hours,
I repeatedly yelled these words.

317
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:11,390
Then I would race up the apartments
when someone yelled, "Sticky rice cakes!"

318
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:13,141
and sell it to them.

319
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:16,019
Sticky rice cakes!

320
00:23:17,687 --> 00:23:20,065
Buckwheat jelly!

321
00:23:22,025 --> 00:23:24,903
Sticky rice cakes!

322
00:23:24,986 --> 00:23:29,699
ESTABLISHING THE MILLENNIAL KINGDOM

323
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:38,458
A huge sum of money was piling up
since everybody was working.

324
00:23:39,167 --> 00:23:43,547
We started using that money
to buy more and more land.

325
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:46,591
On December 19th, 1982,

326
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:49,010
we bought some land in Icheon
for the first time.

327
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:51,388
She went to take a look.

328
00:23:52,222 --> 00:23:54,808
There were empty fields
and mountains there.

329
00:23:55,642 --> 00:23:58,228
She was looking for a foundation
to build houses on.

330
00:23:58,311 --> 00:24:00,522
She bought tens of thousands
of square meters.

331
00:24:09,072 --> 00:24:13,160
When the Baby Garden was being built,
we all went up there carrying buckets.

332
00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:16,037
At first, the followers
built the buildings themselves.

333
00:24:16,663 --> 00:24:22,419
Every single thing was built
by the labor of both men and women,

334
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:25,297
who wore carriers on their backs.

335
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:28,633
Yes, the members did all of it.
We didn't hire anybody.

336
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:32,262
"We do not live
to pursue worldly pleasures."

337
00:24:32,345 --> 00:24:36,016
"We will go to the eternal kingdom."

338
00:24:36,099 --> 00:24:38,101
"This place is Heaven on Earth."

339
00:24:48,528 --> 00:24:49,905
The Baby Garden?

340
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:53,158
Looking back now,
I was living in the Devil's Garden.

341
00:24:53,241 --> 00:24:57,662
The life I lived there
was the complete opposite

342
00:24:57,746 --> 00:25:01,124
of what I expected when I first joined.

343
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:06,046
The stories of the victims
of the religious cult, the Baby Garden,

344
00:25:06,129 --> 00:25:08,924
are beyond imaginable to normal people.

345
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:11,468
They were forced
to perform heavy labor from dawn,

346
00:25:11,551 --> 00:25:14,679
and they could be killed
if they disobeyed their leader.

347
00:25:14,763 --> 00:25:16,932
Their lives were literally hell.

348
00:25:19,142 --> 00:25:24,356
The Baby Garden
was not just a regular cult.

349
00:25:25,565 --> 00:25:28,777
They brainwashed ordinary people

350
00:25:29,444 --> 00:25:32,155
and made them work like livestock.

351
00:25:42,499 --> 00:25:46,294
THREE THINGS TO QUIT
IN ORDER TO ENTER THE MILLENNIAL KINGDOM

352
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:49,923
Ties to compassion, material goods,
and sexual desire.

353
00:25:50,006 --> 00:25:54,177
We had to cut those ties
to live eternally and enter that world.

354
00:25:55,428 --> 00:25:59,224
TIES TO COMPASSION:
AN OBSESSION WITH YOUR FAMILY

355
00:25:59,307 --> 00:26:02,018
Back then, I would have killed my parents

356
00:26:02,102 --> 00:26:05,397
if Kim Ki-soon had ordered me to.

357
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,649
We had to cut our ties to compassion.

358
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:12,195
It didn't matter if it was your child,
husband, or mother.

359
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:14,281
She said that compassion made us weak,

360
00:26:14,364 --> 00:26:16,199
which is why we had to cut it off.

361
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:18,785
You couldn't even say things like "Honey."

362
00:26:18,868 --> 00:26:22,080
You couldn't think
of your own children as yours.

363
00:26:22,163 --> 00:26:25,166
You had to think of them
as other members of the Baby Garden.

364
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:28,253
They made the kids
call their mothers "Ma'am."

365
00:26:28,336 --> 00:26:29,838
They did it to kids back then.

366
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:36,720
They had to put the mothers to work,
but the kids were whining

367
00:26:36,803 --> 00:26:40,348
and grabbing their mothers' skirts,
saying, "Mom, I want this. I want that."

368
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:42,642
And Kim Ki-soon
couldn't stand the sight of that.

369
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:47,397
SHE SAID I SHOULDN'T CALL THEM
"FATHER" AND "BROTHER"

370
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:50,567
BUT I WAS TOLD TO CALL THEM "SIR,"
AND MY MOTHER "MA'AM"

371
00:26:51,484 --> 00:26:55,989
I MISSED MY PARENTS SO MUCH,
BUT I HAD TO CUT MY TIES WITH THEM

372
00:26:56,072 --> 00:26:59,868
I HAD TO LIVE
WITH ONLY KIM KI-SOON ALONE IN MY HEART

373
00:26:59,951 --> 00:27:01,828
We lived separately.

374
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:05,582
The women lived with women,

375
00:27:05,665 --> 00:27:08,960
and the men lived with men
in separate rooms.

376
00:27:09,044 --> 00:27:10,503
MEN'S ROOM, KIM KI-SOON, WOMEN'S ROOM

377
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:12,297
We had to work as soon as we got up.

378
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:15,759
Thinking back on it now, we were insane.
I must have been crazy.

379
00:27:15,842 --> 00:27:17,844
I don't know what I was doing there.

380
00:27:17,927 --> 00:27:19,179
Back in there,

381
00:27:20,013 --> 00:27:22,140
only special people
could go to the hospital.

382
00:27:22,223 --> 00:27:24,643
Normally, people took care
of themselves at home.

383
00:27:25,185 --> 00:27:30,607
You had to have a special, severe illness
to go to the hospital.

384
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:32,525
She told us to use moxibustion

385
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:34,611
when it became hard
to work due to sore arms.

386
00:27:36,029 --> 00:27:42,369
So I got moxibustion everywhere,
on my shoulders, elbows, and stomach.

387
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:44,079
To treat myself.

388
00:27:49,959 --> 00:27:52,045
This is where they performed moxibustion.

389
00:27:52,545 --> 00:27:54,714
I got a huge scar from it like this.

390
00:27:55,298 --> 00:27:58,218
My life became so hard
because of all the moxibustion.

391
00:27:59,469 --> 00:28:03,515
When you get moxibustion,
the area starts oozing.

392
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:07,686
It got itchy while I was working,
and I couldn't stand it.

393
00:28:07,769 --> 00:28:09,938
There were a lot of aftereffects.

394
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:12,357
I felt like a squid shriveling up
over the fire.

395
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:15,068
Pain during giving birth
is painful and horrifying,

396
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:18,405
but it was even more painful than that.

397
00:28:18,488 --> 00:28:20,824
I have big scars. I have two of them.

398
00:28:20,907 --> 00:28:22,158
Where do you have them?

399
00:28:22,242 --> 00:28:23,076
On my stomach.

400
00:28:23,576 --> 00:28:26,329
TIES TO SEXUAL DESIRE:
AN OBSESSION WITH THE OPPOSITE SEX

401
00:28:26,413 --> 00:28:30,041
To let go of sexual desire,
you had to live alone and not love anyone.

402
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:33,461
So it was okay to love God,

403
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:37,257
but you couldn't love anybody else
in this world.

404
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:40,135
It was a sin for men and women
to date and love each other.

405
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:42,971
If they did,
it would be considered adultery.

406
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:48,268
IF A MAN AND WOMAN WERE INVOLVED
IN SOMETHING RESEMBLING A RELATIONSHIP

407
00:28:48,351 --> 00:28:51,146
THEY WERE TREATED LIKE SLAVES
THEY WEREN'T EVEN TREATED AS HUMAN BEINGS

408
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:53,982
TO A DEGREE THAT COULDN'T BE SEEN
ANYWHERE ELSE ON THE FACE OF THE EARTH

409
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:57,318
The woman and man both became servants.

410
00:28:57,402 --> 00:29:01,281
And she wouldn't treat them like adults,
but like servants instead.

411
00:29:01,364 --> 00:29:05,076
So, unless Kim Ki-soon let them go,

412
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,996
those people had no freedom,
like as if they were in jail.

413
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:09,706
They had to do everything.

414
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:13,209
They got up very early in the morning
and cleaned like servants.

415
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:15,628
They had to sleep less than other people.

416
00:29:15,712 --> 00:29:19,549
They lost all of their freedom.

417
00:29:19,632 --> 00:29:23,595
You had to keep your head down
and look at the ground like a sinner.

418
00:29:26,681 --> 00:29:28,933
I used to work with this guy.

419
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:32,604
I began to depend on him emotionally
and eventually started to like him.

420
00:29:32,687 --> 00:29:35,523
I was having a really hard time
because of my feelings.

421
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:38,318
But then Kim Ki-soon found out about it.

422
00:29:38,401 --> 00:29:42,906
After that,
I basically lived a life of a servant.

423
00:29:42,989 --> 00:29:46,659
I had to wear clothes
that were incredibly old and ragged,

424
00:29:46,743 --> 00:29:50,288
and I had to work even
when others were asleep.

425
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:52,916
Back then, beatings were very frequent.

426
00:29:52,999 --> 00:29:55,001
She didn't beat you in public though.

427
00:29:55,084 --> 00:29:59,214
She took you somewhere
and just beat you with whatever…

428
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:01,549
I saw her using a chain once.

429
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:04,469
She would take a bicycle chain…

430
00:30:06,596 --> 00:30:08,598
She beat people up however she wanted.

431
00:30:09,682 --> 00:30:11,768
She had their family members
hit them first.

432
00:30:11,851 --> 00:30:16,648
You get less legal punishment
if a family member beats them, apparently.

433
00:30:16,731 --> 00:30:20,318
There would be grounds for assault
if someone else hits first.

434
00:30:20,944 --> 00:30:24,656
But if it was a family member,
you could say it was disciplinary.

435
00:30:24,739 --> 00:30:26,908
There were even kids
who hit their parents.

436
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:32,121
How could a child hit their own parent?

437
00:30:32,872 --> 00:30:38,920
But in order to live there,
my older sister and I had to hit our mom.

438
00:30:41,548 --> 00:30:42,924
Kim Ki-soon said

439
00:30:43,424 --> 00:30:47,262
that my mother had gone crazy
because she was possessed by a ghost.

440
00:30:47,345 --> 00:30:51,683
Kim Ki-soon said my mother found a man,
hugged him and made love with him.

441
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:55,562
She told me and my older sister
to beat her up.

442
00:30:57,272 --> 00:31:00,358
When my sister and I
started to hit my mother,

443
00:31:01,442 --> 00:31:03,862
all the other members there
began to beat her too.

444
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:11,661
Many things happened there
that people couldn't possibly imagine.

445
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:15,999
Because all of your friends
were spying on each other,

446
00:31:16,499 --> 00:31:19,002
you never knew
who would dob you in to Kim Ki-soon.

447
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:25,884
That's why I decided to run away
from there when I was in fifth grade.

448
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:29,137
But right there and then,

449
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:32,390
some adults from the Baby Garden came

450
00:31:32,473 --> 00:31:35,768
and dragged me all the way to Icheon.

451
00:31:42,859 --> 00:31:47,196
That's when Kim Ki-soon
started to beat me up.

452
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:52,994
I was beaten to the brink of death.

453
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:56,247
I'm not lying when I say
that every inch of my body was bruised.

454
00:31:56,831 --> 00:31:58,333
She didn't miss a single spot.

455
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:02,712
Where were your parents?
Weren't they there?

456
00:32:02,795 --> 00:32:05,173
To be honest, they couldn't intervene.

457
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:06,257
If they came there

458
00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:09,844
and confronted her about hitting me,
there would have been bigger problems.

459
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:12,013
Then they would have beaten up all of us.

460
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:16,434
My mother couldn't say anything,
though she must've been really worried.

461
00:32:16,517 --> 00:32:19,604
You couldn't say anything
unless you could defeat Kim Ki-soon.

462
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:22,941
It was absolute terror.

463
00:32:24,317 --> 00:32:25,318
I lived in terror.

464
00:32:25,401 --> 00:32:28,237
Because back then,
things like that happened all the time.

465
00:32:28,321 --> 00:32:29,906
She would hit you all the time,

466
00:32:30,406 --> 00:32:32,575
and she would gather people to hit you.

467
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:34,619
It would happen very commonly,

468
00:32:34,702 --> 00:32:36,746
so I lived in terror back then.

469
00:32:36,829 --> 00:32:40,249
Some of the people
who escaped the Baby Garden

470
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:42,752
began to share their shocking stories.

471
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:51,010
They said that Kim Ki-soon
had slept with a lot of young guys.

472
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:56,391
I mean, she forced and ritualized everyone
to live an ascetic life.

473
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:57,892
But to fulfill her own desires,

474
00:32:57,976 --> 00:33:03,815
she picked out those nice guys
who were healthy and handsome,

475
00:33:03,898 --> 00:33:07,402
and she toyed with them.

476
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:12,573
Around the time of the trial,
when I wrote a news article about that,

477
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:16,786
my witness said that God had touched them.

478
00:33:19,205 --> 00:33:20,915
THROWING SEX PARTIES

479
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:25,837
She didn't do it with just anybody.
She only let her favorites do it.

480
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:30,049
What do you think they did
behind closed doors every time they met?

481
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:33,302
When she showed me her breasts,

482
00:33:33,386 --> 00:33:36,723
being a young man,
I couldn't just turn away.

483
00:33:36,806 --> 00:33:38,391
So I sucked on them.

484
00:33:38,474 --> 00:33:40,643
I really thought of her as my lover.

485
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:43,146
There were many young people back then.

486
00:33:43,229 --> 00:33:47,233
Many of them were younger than me too.
In our days, we were all in our twenties.

487
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:52,155
When she gave us a hug
and patted us on the back,

488
00:33:52,238 --> 00:33:54,907
I mean, it was the best…

489
00:33:55,658 --> 00:33:57,660
We did it because it felt good.

490
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:06,085
Young and handsome men
were Kim Ki-soon's favorite type.

491
00:34:08,504 --> 00:34:09,714
At the time, we thought

492
00:34:11,507 --> 00:34:15,136
that our relationships with God
and the opposite sex were the same.

493
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:21,851
I mean, how nice is it
to think that God was your lover?

494
00:34:21,934 --> 00:34:27,231
That's why we devoted our pure love
and everything to her.

495
00:34:27,315 --> 00:34:29,233
Whenever guys went in there,

496
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:32,445
they started grunting
and making these weird noises.

497
00:34:32,528 --> 00:34:34,781
So I figured that they were doing it.
Even so, it…

498
00:34:34,864 --> 00:34:39,243
-What do you mean by grunting?
-I mean, you could hear them making love.

499
00:34:39,327 --> 00:34:42,955
Guys were always going in
and out of her room.

500
00:34:43,623 --> 00:34:46,793
A guy would come out,
and he'd tell another guy to go inside.

501
00:34:46,876 --> 00:34:49,545
After being called,
the other guy would go inside too.

502
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:52,799
When they came back out,
their faces were all red.

503
00:34:52,882 --> 00:34:54,717
All night long, they all tried to go in,

504
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:57,512
but there were men
who didn't get to do it after waiting.

505
00:34:57,595 --> 00:34:59,972
From what I know,
she didn't spend a night alone.

506
00:35:00,056 --> 00:35:01,557
Whenever the guys went in,

507
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:03,434
all the women were envious.

508
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:07,688
They were experiencing all her love,
which seemed to be the right way,

509
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:09,232
but we were born women…

510
00:35:09,315 --> 00:35:11,901
We were all jealous.
I wasn't the only one.

511
00:35:18,407 --> 00:35:23,454
I got special treatment
in the Baby Garden.

512
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:28,042
I must've been pretty handsome back then.

513
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:34,507
It was obvious she treated me well,
so well that others would be jealous.

514
00:35:35,508 --> 00:35:38,761
For example, she alone
would have nice food in front of her,

515
00:35:39,595 --> 00:35:42,974
but she would eat a little and tell me,

516
00:35:43,057 --> 00:35:45,685
"Come sit over here.
You can eat this instead."

517
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:50,398
And whenever she called for me,

518
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:53,484
she was lying on her bed in her pajamas.

519
00:35:54,193 --> 00:35:57,446
Her pajamas always showed her cleavage.

520
00:35:58,114 --> 00:35:59,991
Then she'd say, "You want to look?"

521
00:36:00,074 --> 00:36:04,453
She'd show me her breasts
and tell me to touch them.

522
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:09,417
She'd say, "Are you shy? But I'm Love."

523
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:12,420
"Then take off your clothes."

524
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:15,089
"Come on, pull down your pants, okay?"

525
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:17,133
"Just show me."

526
00:36:17,216 --> 00:36:20,845
That's how she sexually assaulted me.

527
00:36:23,764 --> 00:36:26,017
Goodness, I don't even want
to think about it.

528
00:36:26,809 --> 00:36:28,978
Ugh, it makes me want
to throw up. Honestly.

529
00:36:31,397 --> 00:36:35,193
Looking back, she was playing with us
very strategically.

530
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:40,406
She was taking advantage
of those young men's naïveté.

531
00:36:42,325 --> 00:36:45,369
Guys like me got a taste of that

532
00:36:45,453 --> 00:36:47,914
and thought of her as a love interest,

533
00:36:47,997 --> 00:36:50,458
so we started working really hard for her.

534
00:36:56,756 --> 00:36:58,716
I mean, it's pretty incredible.

535
00:36:58,799 --> 00:37:05,264
She basically enslaved everybody
in that organization for herself.

536
00:37:05,348 --> 00:37:09,143
The unique thing about the Baby Garden
was that it was very enclosed.

537
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:10,353
They didn't evangelize.

538
00:37:10,436 --> 00:37:14,398
Cults usually try to take in more people
from outside and expand,

539
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:19,403
but the Baby Garden made money
by exploiting their own members for labor.

540
00:37:19,487 --> 00:37:23,991
With that money,
Kim Ki-soon could do whatever she wanted.

541
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:28,871
I was basically a slave.

542
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:31,332
I was Kim Ki-soon's slave.

543
00:37:31,999 --> 00:37:34,085
They put every single person to work.

544
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:37,421
People who couldn't sell things
were sent to the farm.

545
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:40,216
If they couldn't work there,
they were sent somewhere else.

546
00:37:40,299 --> 00:37:42,802
Even the old women
had to trim the vegetables

547
00:37:42,885 --> 00:37:45,179
and help with the cooking.

548
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:47,223
Nobody was allowed to be lazy.

549
00:37:47,306 --> 00:37:51,394
I just wanted to lie down on the streets
for five minutes and take a nap.

550
00:37:51,978 --> 00:37:54,480
I got so sleepy on the streets. I mean, I…

551
00:37:54,563 --> 00:37:56,941
I would just let myself go
after I finish selling,

552
00:37:57,024 --> 00:37:59,777
and it felt like I'd feel much better

553
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:03,614
if there was nothing on the ground,
and I could just sleep for five minutes.

554
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:08,160
THIS FOOTAGE DOES NOT CONTAIN
ANYONE FEATURED

555
00:38:08,661 --> 00:38:11,622
On March 11,
at Jongno 3-ga Station in Seoul,

556
00:38:12,373 --> 00:38:15,418
a child in ratty clothes
boarded the subway train in the afternoon.

557
00:38:15,501 --> 00:38:17,837
He held out gum and chocolate
to the passengers.

558
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,630
-How much is it?
-One thousand won.

559
00:38:20,506 --> 00:38:23,634
The Baby Garden used kids to sell things,

560
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:26,387
making them act like orphans
to make people buy from them.

561
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:29,015
They were little kids
in elementary and middle school.

562
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:32,059
And they made the kids go
and beg people to "just buy one."

563
00:38:33,436 --> 00:38:34,895
"Go follow that person."

564
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:37,398
"You can go follow that lady over there."

565
00:38:41,027 --> 00:38:42,320
The kids were begging.

566
00:38:42,403 --> 00:38:45,823
They all did that.
All the kids did it. Every single one.

567
00:38:58,836 --> 00:39:02,590
None of my kids ever went to high school.

568
00:39:02,673 --> 00:39:05,551
There were some very smart kids
who were very intelligent.

569
00:39:05,634 --> 00:39:09,680
But some of them weren't sent to school,
even though they were so smart.

570
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:13,100
Because we were living
in the Kingdom of God,

571
00:39:14,143 --> 00:39:15,811
she said we didn't need to learn,

572
00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:19,148
and she emphasized
that we didn't need to study.

573
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:22,610
So I dropped out of school
during the summer break

574
00:39:22,693 --> 00:39:24,445
of my first year in middle school.

575
00:39:24,528 --> 00:39:26,572
"Why go to school
when the world is ending?"

576
00:39:26,655 --> 00:39:28,157
She didn't let them go to school.

577
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:31,619
On the other hand,
her own kids were doing great.

578
00:39:31,702 --> 00:39:35,706
They went to college and studied abroad.

579
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:40,920
At the time,
there wasn't a thing called salary.

580
00:39:41,003 --> 00:39:44,298
I'd never seen a bankbook before,
and I didn't even know I had one.

581
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:49,804
They made our seals as they pleased,
used them to open our bank accounts,

582
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:52,932
and they managed the accounts
all by themselves.

583
00:39:53,015 --> 00:39:55,309
I lived on whatever they gave us.

584
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:58,646
We had to work whenever they told us to.
That's just how we lived.

585
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:03,484
Cult leader Kim Ki-soon
founded a company called Synnara

586
00:40:03,567 --> 00:40:05,986
using the offerings of her followers.

587
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:09,198
This company is seen as very influential
in the recording industry.

588
00:40:09,865 --> 00:40:13,869
Synnara, a music distribution company,
was founded in 1982.

589
00:40:13,953 --> 00:40:16,163
The company managed to grow exponentially

590
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:19,625
by even reaching out to rural areas
where it's difficult to buy records.

591
00:40:19,708 --> 00:40:23,504
Back then, we wanted to start
a serious record business.

592
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:25,840
We went to Cheonggyecheon

593
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:29,593
and bought vinyl records
and cassette tapes wholesale,

594
00:40:29,677 --> 00:40:32,471
then started selling them wholesale
to record shops.

595
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:35,683
We didn't have anything to spend money on.

596
00:40:36,392 --> 00:40:40,396
So we managed to save up
a huge amount of money.

597
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:44,859
THE BABY GARDEN IS A "RECORD KINGDOM"

598
00:40:44,942 --> 00:40:49,405
THE LARGEST RECORD STORE
IN SOUTH KOREA WILL OPEN

599
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:56,370
They made so much money.

600
00:40:56,454 --> 00:41:01,333
They were raking in so much money
that it was impossible to count.

601
00:41:01,417 --> 00:41:06,464
I think the area of Kim Ki-soon's room
was about 132 square meters.

602
00:41:06,964 --> 00:41:10,509
When we got the money in cash
and brought it to that room,

603
00:41:10,593 --> 00:41:13,471
two-thirds of it
filled right up to the ceiling.

604
00:41:21,937 --> 00:41:23,397
I lived in terror.

605
00:41:26,233 --> 00:41:31,071
At first, I was thinking,
"Come on, this can't be real."

606
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:34,325
That's how shocking it was.

607
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:37,661
They're all dead.

608
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:42,333
Yoon Yong-ung, Seo Jong-won,
Nak-gwi, and Mi-gyeong.

609
00:41:42,416 --> 00:41:44,418
It was completely beyond my imagination.

610
00:41:45,044 --> 00:41:48,088
But I didn't think
it was complete nonsense.
