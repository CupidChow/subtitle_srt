1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:09,090


2
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,100
   

3
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:13,400
   

4
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:35,990
   

5
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:41,010
   

6
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:45,000
    
 - Where should we sit? 
 - Let's go over there.

7
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,100
Will I be able to...

8
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:51,800
be happy even if I don't have a child?

9
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:58,200
Will we...

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,180
be able to be happy...

11
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:05,600
even when we have a child, Ha Ra?

12
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,900
Wait, who do we have here?

13
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,780
Mom...

14
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:23,800
She was the lady...

15
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,800
you said you were seeing?

16
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:35,240
- Yes... 
 - N-No...

17
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:37,640
- Yes... 
 - No...

18
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:44,670
Here.

19
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:47,380
Pay your bill with this today.

20
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,940
What's all this, though?

21
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:56,540
You don't even have wine.

22
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:59,200
Order an expensive bottle, at least.

23
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,870
Wait, never mind.

24
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:03,060
Wait a minute here.

25
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:05,370
Excuse me?

26
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:21,630
   

27
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,200
Let's get married.

28
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:32,360
- Have you gone insane? 
 - No, I'm totally sane.

29
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,270
Let's get married.

30
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:36,300
Let's get married and raise the baby.

31
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,990
Is marriage a joke?

32
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:41,760
It's not a joke. I'm sincere.

33
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:50,770
How can... you and I get married—

34
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:52,640
Gosh, this is absurd.

35
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,670
Why is this absurd?

36
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:56,810
Why can't we?

37
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:58,740
Are you going to get an abortion, then?

38
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:01,360
I'll decide that on my own!

39
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,690
Okay?

40
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:04,950
But how...

41
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:09,960
How can we get married?

42
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,830
- What are you doing? 
 - It's nothing.

43
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:14,130
- You have a moment, right? 
 - No, we're not done talking.

44
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:16,240
- We're done talking. 
 - Wait. Come in 30 minutes.

45
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:20,350
- Don't listen to him— 
 - Come on, give us 30 minutes. Get out, please.

46
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:23,250
How dare you glare at an elder?

47
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:25,540
You get out and come back in 30 minutes!

48
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:27,580
My situation is more urgent.

49
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:29,100
Come sit.

50
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:35,280
Yes, please go ahead.

51
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:40,300
Well, there's a problem with the good-for-nothing my wife was seeing.

52
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:42,600
Did you come to get a piece of dating advice here?

53
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,400
It's about custody, you punk!

54
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:48,660
What? CEO Seo's ex-wife did?

55
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:50,790
You can just call her his wife since they just quit being married

56
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:53,450
instead of divorcing on paper.

57
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:57,020
They're still married legally, then, aren't they?

58
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:58,850
In any case,

59
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:02,140
she dated someone else when they weren't even officially divorced?

60
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:03,670
It's all about the terms.

61
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:06,130
CEO Seo also agreed to

62
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:09,940
an open relationship with no strings attached when they separated.

63
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:11,320
As if they're totally divorced.

64
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:14,250
But that's not what we were talking about.

65
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:16,770
Right, CEO Seo's ex-wife— No, his wife.

66
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:20,100
I mean... Anyhow, his wife.

67
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:23,750
His wife is suing someone for custody?

68
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,150
What's that about?

69
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:28,100
I can understand how she dated someone else

70
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:30,250
after their separation.

71
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:33,480
She had a kid with another man in that short time?

72
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:36,910
Well, it's not over a human.

73
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:38,480
- Sorry? 
 - What?

74
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:41,720
The custody isn't about a human.

75
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:48,190
As she and William were dating and starting to live together,

76
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:49,780
they adopted a dog.

77
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:51,720
Are you saying they were living together?

78
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,490
Yes. Is there a problem?

79
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:55,700
No, there isn't.

80
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:59,380
Anyhow, they ended up breaking up and

81
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:02,520
William's going back to the U.S.,

82
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,340
but the dog she has been cherishing—

83
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:07,290
So he's going to take the dog with him, right?

84
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:09,780
- Yes, that's right. 
 - And your wife is against it?

85
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:12,200
- Yes. 
 - Gosh, how ridiculous.

86
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:14,760
Can't he give a dog to a woman he loved?

87
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:17,210
He's so weird, too.

88
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:22,800
It's not just "a dog." It's family to them.

89
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,860
I-I know.

90
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:29,680
So, is she going to sue him over custody?

91
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,810
No.

92
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:33,130
They're going to make an agreement first.

93
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:35,850
Korea doesn't accept custody of animals yet.

94
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:38,970
And it won't even be accepted as a custody case.

95
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:40,620
That's true.

96
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:46,600
Anyhow, we're going to have a meeting with William this weekend.

97
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:50,700
Do you, perhaps... have some free time?

98
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:53,650
Could you come with me tomorrow?

99
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:56,250
If you come with me, the communication will

100
00:05:56,250 --> 00:06:00,420
be more smooth since you speak English.

101
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:03,500
What time tomorrow?

102
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,240
2:00.

103
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,530
I don't think I can do it tomorrow.

104
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:12,140
I have plans.

105
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:13,910
Plans?

106
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:16,730
Is it important?

107
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:20,380
Yes, a little.

108
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,590
Gosh, seriously...

109
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:31,480
Good job, everyone.

110
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:34,570
-  Good job!  
 - See you tomorrow.

111
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:37,810
- Great work. 
 -  Great job! 

112
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:40,700
Another day of getting off on time!

113
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,210
Let's talk.

114
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:56,440
What now?

115
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,610
You're getting the surgery tomorrow, aren't you?

116
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:03,740
There's something I must tell you.

117
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:07,730
Please.

118
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,250
Let's go.

119
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:13,500
Okay, I'll go.

120
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:18,470
Where's this place?

121
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:20,100
Huh? Let's get off first.

122
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,340
Let's just talk in the car.

123
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:24,380
Come on, get off for a second. It's nice.

124
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:35,050
What is it?

125
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:37,500
- What? 
 - Well...

126
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,500
   

127
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,190
What is this?

128
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:54,760
I prepared it in a rush.

129
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,540
No, no, n-no!

130
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:58,250
No!

131
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:01,510
Noona...

132
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:07,000
Let's get married.

133
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,280
I'll be good to you.

134
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:15,310
Okay?

135
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,880
Why'd it pop?

136
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:23,300
I'm about to pop here.

137
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:25,500
Why? Is it overwhelming?

138
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,800
Si Wook...

139
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:58,740
 Tell her to wake up already. 

140
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:01,260
Even if you date me, I mean...

141
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:03,190
you won't have kids with anyone.

142
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:06,390
Stop giving false hope to your mom and let her know right away.

143
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:08,820
I can take my time and do it later.

144
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:11,300
Why bother making trouble by telling her ahead?

145
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:15,000
We already have trouble, though.

146
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,150
Mother wants to eat together tomorrow.

147
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:18,740
What?

148
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:21,180
I ran into her in the restroom earlier.

149
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:23,420
So what did you say? Did you agree?

150
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:25,400
I thought she was just saying it...

151
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:28,160
so I roughly gave her a yes.

152
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,500
She's asking if I have time tomorrow for lunch.

153
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,470
Mother hadn't deleted my number.

154
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:35,870
Hey, forget it. Don't go.

155
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:37,650
I'll let her know.

156
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:40,060
Nope! I'm going.

157
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:41,950
I need to go and seal her mouth.

158
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:43,650
Hey, what sealing?

159
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:48,170
Mother's close friend goes to the same church as my mom.

160
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:49,250
Did you forget?

161
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:52,180
Things about us got leaked to her sometimes.

162
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:55,450
I'm going to meet Mother tomorrow to clearly state my case...

163
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:57,500
and draw the line.

164
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,350
What line?

165
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:02,050
That we're not officially dating until the

166
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:05,130
baby issue is settled.

167
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:10,300
Therefore, she shouldn't get her hopes up.

168
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:21,300
Whoa, good shot!

169
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:23,800
It's nothing special.

170
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:26,200
By the way...

171
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:30,100
what a bunch of rubbish am I hearing?

172
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:32,670
How is he always...

173
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:36,570
thinking such unproductive and needless thoughts?

174
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:39,620
There are a lot of people like him nowadays, Mother.

175
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:42,170
Since people don't really feel like they must

176
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:44,800
give birth like in the past.

177
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,450
But I heard you're different.

178
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:52,390
You want a baby, don't you?

179
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,000
Ha Ra... I was really curious

180
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,500
about how you were doing even after you two divorced.

181
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,750
I also missed you.

182
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:12,180
I was so happy when I heard you two were dating again.

183
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:18,670
Thank you for... thinking that way.

184
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:22,010
That's why...

185
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:26,310
Please convince Eun Beom.

186
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:32,800
That punk, as you know, is hopeless unless it's you.

187
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,760
He doesn't really listen to me, either.

188
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:39,720
Gosh, what do we do?

189
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:42,800
Do we need to give up on having a baby?

190
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:49,040
While we're... on the topic, Mother...

191
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:58,930
Honestly, I came... to make a request of you.

192
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:00,900
What request?

193
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:03,490
 What? Conditional gift? 

194
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:08,590
There's this high-value building he wants among Mother's list of assets.

195
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:13,700
If we tell him it'll be gifted to him under the conditions of having a kid,

196
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,300
then wouldn't he fall for it?

197
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:18,300
Wow! You're really something else, too.

198
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:22,790
How could you set up a plot with your mother-in-law and run a three-legged race?

199
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:26,600
They say you'll find a way if you're desperate enough.

200
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,250
It's just a desperate measure.

201
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:32,110
   

202
00:12:38,210 --> 00:12:39,280
   

203
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:45,580
So did Mother-in-law take the deal?

204
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:48,480
Gosh, it's more than that.

205
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,460
She said I'm...

206
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:54,900
the genius strategist Genius Sun Tsu. 
  (A famous Chinese military strategist) 

207
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:59,030
She called you everything good.

208
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:04,410
   

209
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:16,370
   
 Eun Beom, do you have time today? 

210
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:18,540
 I'd like to see you... 

211
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:21,220
 without telling Ha Ra. 

212
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:35,730
Oh, hey. You're here?

213
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,140
- Did you eat? 
 - Yes.

214
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:42,850
- Of course, I ate. 
 - What did you eat?

215
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:45,800
I had a simple bibimbap with sprout vegetables.

216
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,010
Must've been delicious.

217
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:51,740
- Have you eaten, Honey? 
 - Yes, I did.

218
00:13:55,490 --> 00:13:59,000
I recently became a vegetarian.

219
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:04,100
I also had a simple salad with one egg.

220
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:07,200
I'm a pescatarian.

221
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:10,530
- You are? A vegetarian? 
 - Yes. Yes.

222
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:13,160
How unlikely. You used to love meat so much.

223
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:16,070
I saw a documentary a few days ago on Webflix.

224
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:17,810
I realized from watching it,

225
00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:23,210
how cruel and bad for the environment factory farming is.

226
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:26,010
Everything you said was right. None of it was wrong.

227
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:29,720
- Gosh, I should've... listened to you more— 
 - Hello!

228
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:32,370
- Hi. 
 - Hi.

229
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:34,380
Hi.

230
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:37,580
- Hi. 
 - Hi.

231
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:40,880
- Hi. 
 - Hello, William.

232
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,900
Hi, Mr. Seo.

233
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,110
Nice to meet you.

234
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:50,630
Goodness. Me, too.

235
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:52,640
Call me James.

236
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,120
- James? 
 - Yes.

237
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:57,980
My English name is... James.

238
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:01,010
Oh, you have an English name, too?

239
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:02,920
I didn't know.

240
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,560
He's good at Korean?

241
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,430
Of course, he's better than me.

242
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:12,430
He's a really smart guy.

243
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:14,380
I see.

244
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:22,000
   

245
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:27,000
What... What's going on?

246
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,500
Excuse me. Is something wrong?

247
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:33,120
You're Ms. Kang Bi Chwi, who had an appointment today. Right?

248
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,500
- Yes. 
 - Oh, no...

249
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:39,600
Our director just went to the ER because his appendix ruptured.

250
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,830
What do I do, then?

251
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:45,800
Let me help you reschedule your appointment.

252
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:50,880
 I have to go somewhere. Please give me the earliest date. 

253
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:54,000
 - Okay. Just a moment. 
 - Okay. 

254
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,280
Will, I'm sure you know this, but...

255
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:00,510
it's hard to go to court over custody of the dog.

256
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:03,980
It'll be better to go through with an agreement.

257
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:05,970
However, I'm sure you heard.

258
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:09,180
It's not easy for us to come to an agreement right now.

259
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:12,020
Neither Mi Ok or I don't want to give up Charlie.

260
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:14,230
Think about it in Charlie's shoes.

261
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:17,550
Charlie was born and raised in Korea...

262
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:19,840
so how will he fly to your country...

263
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:23,890
and live on in such a faraway land?

264
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:25,500
Faraway land? 
  (Spoken in a Korean idiom) 

265
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,930
Why use such a difficult word?

266
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:30,200
It means it's very far.

267
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,180
You said he's good at Korean.

268
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:35,460
James, I got on flights a few times with Charlie,

269
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:38,750
but Charlie doesn't have difficulty flying, fortunately.

270
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:42,030
Right, Mi Ok? We took him to Hawaii once.

271
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:47,140
Honey... though I'm lacking, I can do all I can for Charlie.

272
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:49,250
We have lived here happily so far.

273
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:52,760
What is it that Charlie doesn't have? Tell me if there is.

274
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:55,750
No, I'm not saying you're not good enough for him.

275
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:58,700
In that case, entrust him to me, please?

276
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:04,180
The U.S. can guarantee Charlie vast freedom and rights.

277
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:07,640
You also agreed with that, baby.

278
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:12,100
Then if you and Charlie both leave me, Honey...

279
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:16,350
What about me? How can I go on?

280
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:21,240
Baby... don't cry...

281
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:38,970
Unni... since things ended up this way, just—

282
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:41,700
Don't say it.

283
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:45,970
If you're going to tell me to rethink this since things ended up this way,

284
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:48,100
just don't say it.

285
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:52,780
I was going to say, let's get some food since things ended up this way.

286
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:55,260
Are you craving anything in particular?

287
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:56,900
No, nothing.

288
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:59,730
I just don't feel like eating.

289
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:03,740
Okay. I'll go straight to your house, then.

290
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:20,600
Oh, Ma'am! Please take your package.

291
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:27,380
What is all this?

292
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:29,990
Somebody dropped it off.

293
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:03,500
What's this?

294
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:24,030
 Noona... thank you for hanging in there. 

295
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:30,160
 Although this wasn't the result I wished for, I respect your decision. 

296
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:34,200
 I mean, if it's what you chose, then you're right, Noona. 

297
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:39,000
 This place had the best seaweed soup I had tried in Seoul.  
 - Please put it in here.

298
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,800
 It must've been hard today. 

299
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:44,400
 So I hope you'll get a good sleep after eating this. 

300
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:51,000
 There's nothing much I can do for you besides this. 

301
00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:53,010
 I'm sorry. 

302
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:57,610
 I'm sorry for making you suffer on your own, 

303
00:19:57,610 --> 00:20:02,720
 and if there's anything I can do for you, feel free to let me know. 

304
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,800
 Give me a call when you read this. 

305
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:07,400
 Because I'll be worried if you're feeling okay. 

306
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,420
Yes, it's me.

307
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:52,230
Yes, I got the box. Thank you.

308
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:57,600
I have a favor to ask of you...

309
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:03,250
I'm really sorry, but...

310
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:11,290
Can you please quit working at the office, Si Wook?

311
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:12,940
 Pardon? 

312
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:16,110
Why? Is it not true?

313
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:18,560
Did I get the wrong information?

314
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:22,900
I heard it from your mother. Is it still not true?

315
00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:30,160
You didn't even have another woman back then.

316
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,690
Y-You...

317
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:45,320
You jerk! You're such a jerk!

318
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:49,330
I'm sorry.

319
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:54,440
If you're sorry, break up right now. That will be enough.

320
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:58,970
Promise me before you go. That you'll break up right away with Ha Ra today.

321
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:06,700
- M-Mother— 
 - Hurry up and answer!

322
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:17,300
I'm sorry!

323
00:22:18,930 --> 00:22:25,140
I don't have the right unless Ha Ra... wants to break up with me.

324
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:31,570
I'm really sorry.

325
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:35,990
My god, I'm losing it...

326
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:45,510
Thus, we eventually decided to go to court.

327
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:49,220
But fortunately, a similar precedence was found in Korea last year.

328
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:52,850
Was there a custody suit over a pet even in Korea?

329
00:22:52,850 --> 00:22:57,330
It wasn't a custody suit but an ownership confirmation suit.

330
00:22:57,330 --> 00:23:00,910
And the court gave a verdict that reflected animal rights.

331
00:23:00,910 --> 00:23:03,340
Whoa, that's a good precedence.

332
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:06,850
So are you going to handle it yourself, CEO Seo?

333
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:10,250
Yes. I'll be handling it myself, but...

334
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:13,200
Attorney Kang will be assisting me since she needs to

335
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,780
help me with researching U.S. laws.

336
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:22,490
- Attorney Oh, I'd also like you to put your name on it for your name value. 
 - Me too

337
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:24,800
Is this the lawsuit of this age?

338
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,020
Taking three attorneys...

339
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:29,200
Why is Attorney Oh lending you her name? Don't do it.

340
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,880
Hey, you! We really can't lose this case!

341
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:35,060
Everyone help! No one's backing out.

342
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:38,040
Okay. Attorney Oh, what do you want to do? Will you join?

343
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:43,850
Gosh, I'll just do it.

344
00:23:43,850 --> 00:23:46,700
CEO Seo's getting back together with his wife is on the line.

345
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:49,410
Gosh, thank you.

346
00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:51,730
All right, then. Today's meeting is over.

347
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:53,820
Oh, wait. One moment, please.

348
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:57,730
- I have an announcement to make. 
 - Okay, what is it?

349
00:23:57,730 --> 00:24:02,980
I'm fine with Attorney Kang being the assistant, but please go easy on her.

350
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:04,290
Gosh, why?

351
00:24:04,290 --> 00:24:06,090
She's pregnant.

352
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:13,910
- You little— 
 - With my baby.

353
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:16,980
We'll be getting married soon.

354
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:29,330
Whoa! This is...

355
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:41,540
I mean, I was going to tell you...

356
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:44,680
but I just couldn't do it.

357
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:47,570
Would you like to cuss me out or something?

358
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:49,770
You can hit me, even.

359
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:55,230
Did you lose your speech from the shock?

360
00:24:55,230 --> 00:24:57,280
How many fingers is this?

361
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:59,730
Huh? Look here.

362
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:03,620
- Three. 
 - Right.

363
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:07,750
You, Si Wook, and...

364
00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:10,760
the baby.

365
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:17,300
Three people. A happy family.

366
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:21,920
Cut it out. I'm sorry!

367
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:24,150
Tell me...

368
00:25:24,150 --> 00:25:30,930
in detail, with all five W's!

369
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:35,540
Include who, what, when, where, and why...

370
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:39,070
Think of it as writing a written statement. Don't leave anything out.

371
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:44,670
If not... I won't allow this marriage—

372
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:47,130
I can't do it!

373
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:52,500
Okay, okay. Take a seat. I'll explain.

374
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:56,030
 Ms. Han was right about them two! 

375
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:58,630
 It's amazing. This isn't a prank, right? 

376
00:25:58,630 --> 00:26:00,310
 I still can't believe it. 

377
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:05,140
 Seriously. Didn't they say Attorney Kwon looks like Attorney Kang's ex? 

378
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:08,050
 If that's why she's dating him... 

379
00:26:08,050 --> 00:26:10,530
 It's really chaotic. 

380
00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:13,640
 They were fighting every day. Did they fall in love while fighting? 

381
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,720
 Why would our clients break up, then? 

382
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:18,040
 They should get closer the more they fight. 

383
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:21,500
 There's definitely something we don't know. 

384
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:27,480
He said he'll raise the kid?

385
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:30,290
Seriously? Really?

386
00:26:30,290 --> 00:26:34,210
 Gosh, have you been lied to all your life? I can't lie. 

387
00:26:36,490 --> 00:26:39,140
 I'll do all the housekeeping. 

388
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:41,450
 You can do everything you want. 

389
00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:44,210
 You said you want to be a human rights lawyer. 

390
00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:49,010
 Great. Open your office, do human rights work, 

391
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:52,530
 and even become the Minister of Justice! 

392
00:26:54,850 --> 00:26:59,210
 Noona, I don't know if you know, but I... 

393
00:26:59,210 --> 00:27:01,460
 don't really have an ambition. 

394
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:05,460
 Becoming a good dad and a good husband... 

395
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:07,910
 are the only dreams for me. 

396
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:12,610
 Do everything you want to do. 

397
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:35,750
You hit the jackpot, Unni. Kwon Si Wook is so cool!

398
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:40,040
-  I'm not getting scammed, am I? 
 - Come on.

399
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:43,780
He's simple and narrow-minded, but

400
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:47,600
he wouldn't backstab or scam someone.

401
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:52,420
That's right. You're the one who backstabbed me.

402
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:56,380
Ha Ra... I'm sorry!

403
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:58,860
I'm sorry. Okay?

404
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:00,830
Hey, come out, Bride.

405
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:02,400
Stop crying, and let's go to the meeting.

406
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:06,120
Whoa... This is how you're making fun of me?

407
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:08,010
Of course.

408
00:28:08,010 --> 00:28:14,110
♫  Kang Bi Chwi and Kwon Si Wook are getting married  ♫

409
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:16,010
Gosh, seriously.

410
00:28:16,010 --> 00:28:18,240
- ♫  Look at those two  ♫ 
 - Good god...

411
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,130
- Come out quickly. 
 - Seriously...

412
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:24,740
Let's go, Bride.

413
00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:30,350
Are you really going to quit being a lawyer if Senior Kang tells you to?

414
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:31,400
Yup.

415
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,360
You're such a romantic, Kwon Si Wook.

416
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:36,430
It'll be comfortable doing chores and parenting.

417
00:28:36,430 --> 00:28:37,950
Noona will make money outside.

418
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:41,030
Hey, do you know how hard housekeeping is?

419
00:28:41,030 --> 00:28:43,350
You know nothing about the world.

420
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:45,530
Well, that must be why you agreed.

421
00:28:45,530 --> 00:28:50,020
Even if it's hard, you just do what you need to do. What's to say you can't?

422
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:52,340
My mom did it all her life.

423
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:55,930
I'm not sure if you're progressive or conservative. It's a mystery.

424
00:28:55,930 --> 00:28:58,300
There's no progressive or conservative in love.

425
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:01,390
The one who loves more needs to go for it!

426
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:07,310
Okay. I'm rooting for your second act in life, Housekeeper Kwon Si Wook.

427
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:10,920
I'll make sure to get you an extra-large apron for your housewarming.

428
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:14,390
- No, I already wrote down what you can get me. I'll send it to you. 
 - What is it?

429
00:29:14,390 --> 00:29:18,390
They said you don't buy windy stuff for a dowry.

430
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:20,300
- So, an AC... 
 - You have one on the ceiling.

431
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:23,800
Yes, there is. It's usually planted these days, huh?

432
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:27,260
- But radiators nowadays— 
 - It's double purpose. It works.

433
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:30,030
- Oh, it does both? 
 - Yes.

434
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:33,050
- Isn't it salty? 
 - It's delicious.

435
00:29:33,050 --> 00:29:36,070
It wouldn't be. You're saltier. 
  ("Salty" in Korean means cheap) 

436
00:29:42,890 --> 00:29:46,780
We probably used my name as the guardian when we were adopting him.

437
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:51,150
I see. I think you'll need to double-check that.

438
00:29:51,150 --> 00:29:57,970
It's very important who's usually registered as the guardian on legal documents.

439
00:29:57,970 --> 00:30:01,720
Who was the guardian when you were registering with the county?

440
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:05,420
That was also under my name since we registered with my county.

441
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:09,040
It wouldn't be hard to confirm you as the owner, then.

442
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:13,820
However, William paid for all the related expenses.

443
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:15,950
Right?

444
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:20,100
That could make things a bit disadvantageous...

445
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:21,500
Right...

446
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:29,820
- You're here? 
 - Yes.

447
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:32,220
- Were you waiting for a long time? 
 - No, I just came.

448
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:33,750
I'm glad.

449
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:37,780
Let's stop by Mother's house on the way to mine.

450
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:40,000
Mother?

451
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,980
Whose?

452
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:45,810
Would I say "Mother" to mean my mom? I'd just say my mom.

453
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:50,740
Mother told me to stop by since she made soy sauce crabs that I like.

454
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:53,740
Hey, forget it. Tell her it's fine.

455
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:55,570
Why?

456
00:30:55,570 --> 00:30:59,020
You said you'll draw the line, saying we're not officially dating.

457
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:00,900
But what...

458
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:03,150
Why are you accepting soy sauce crabs?

459
00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:05,630
Well, that's true, but...

460
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:09,550
Mother said she made it specifically for me.

461
00:31:09,550 --> 00:31:11,960
Should I tell her to throw them out?

462
00:31:24,530 --> 00:31:27,000
Wow, this place is still the same.

463
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,620
Let's get the crabs and leave right away.

464
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:33,960
Let me know when you're finished. I'll make you a new batch.

465
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,280
You like this, don't you?

466
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:38,170
- Thank you, Mother— 
 - It's fine. We'll buy them next time.

467
00:31:38,170 --> 00:31:39,880
Let's go.

468
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,460
Hold up and take a seat!

469
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:45,600
I need to tell you something.

470
00:31:57,860 --> 00:32:03,620
I heard from Ha Ra about you two agreeing not to have a baby even if you get back together.

471
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:08,390
Who said you won't have a baby?

472
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:15,840
It's my life. Stay out of it, so I can take care of it myself.

473
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:18,600
What did you say, you punk? It's your life?

474
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:22,130
What did you ever take care of—

475
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:38,060
If you have a baby, I'll give you the building in Bangbae-dong.

476
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:51,430
You wanted that building, didn't you?

477
00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:53,390
I'll give it to you if you have a baby.

478
00:32:53,390 --> 00:32:57,020
So have one.

479
00:33:02,130 --> 00:33:04,510
Why aren't you saying anything?

480
00:33:04,510 --> 00:33:06,600
You don't want it?

481
00:33:12,330 --> 00:33:14,820
This is really ridiculous.

482
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:19,980
You're bossing me with money again.

483
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:22,760
Even telling me to have a baby now...

484
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,900
If you're a proper-minded parent,

485
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:29,870
shouldn't you first ask why your son doesn't want to have a baby?

486
00:33:29,870 --> 00:33:31,380
What—

487
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:33,120
Listen to you talk.

488
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:36,550
It's probably a worthless reason anyway, so why would I ask that?

489
00:33:36,550 --> 00:33:40,940
Would I have gotten a divorce if it was a worthless reason?

490
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:42,440
I told you so many times, Mom.

491
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:44,160
Whenever you do this, I get so sick of you!

492
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:46,990
Y-You crazy punk, how dare you...

493
00:33:46,990 --> 00:33:50,390
say you get sick of your own mom in front of her.

494
00:33:50,390 --> 00:33:54,260
Is that something you should say?

495
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:56,630
Mother, please calm down.

496
00:34:04,870 --> 00:34:08,340
I-I can't believe I consider him a son...

497
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:13,350
I can't believe I happily ate seaweed soup after giving birth to him...

498
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:18,400
I can't believe it... Goodness...

499
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:24,440
Eun Beom...

500
00:34:46,950 --> 00:34:48,810
I'm sorry.

501
00:34:48,810 --> 00:34:51,980
I enticed Mother.

502
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:54,480
Since you like money so much...

503
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:57,560
I thought it would work if Mother and I sided together.

504
00:34:57,560 --> 00:35:02,720
I brought it up to Mother first.

505
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:05,030
It's all my scheme.

506
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:09,090
You do like money.

507
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,880
Why did you hate it so much?

508
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:18,210
For Mother, she used the means she could use.

509
00:35:18,210 --> 00:35:22,200
That's not bossing. It's between a parent and a child.

510
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:34,670
Aren't you going to accept my apology?

511
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:42,100
Forget it.

512
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:47,680
It's not because of you.

513
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:49,450
My mother was always like that.

514
00:35:49,450 --> 00:35:52,900
Threatening with money is my mother's specialty.

515
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:57,600
She would've done it eventually, even if you didn't make her.

516
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:00,370
Don't worry because it's not your fault.

517
00:36:01,270 --> 00:36:04,150
Hey, how's that a threat?

518
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:08,820
Mother loves you so much, so she's trying to get on your good side.

519
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:13,760
Do parents usually get on their kids' good sides that way?

520
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:19,780
Well sometimes, I guess?

521
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:26,430
Did you ever get your lunch money taken from you for getting lower grades?

522
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:27,990
 You got a B? 

523
00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:30,610
 Didn't you study math? 

524
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:45,820
 - Enjoy your lunch. 
 - Yes! 

525
00:36:46,890 --> 00:36:48,930
 Hey, let's go eat lunch. 

526
00:36:48,930 --> 00:36:50,370
 You go ahead. 

527
00:36:50,370 --> 00:36:52,580
 Hurry up and come! 

528
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:55,160
 Don't run. You'll get hurt. 

529
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:05,070
What about getting your bus fare taken away for

530
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:07,840
playing with a kid your mom said not to play with?

531
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:14,500
I don't consider such actions as a parent trying to get on a child's good side.

532
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:17,940
But rather financial abuse.

533
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,910
She's been like that all her life.

534
00:37:21,910 --> 00:37:24,780
Making financial threats and yelling when she's not happy with something.

535
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:28,920
She needs to have everything in her hands and controlled.

536
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:30,950
What does she think of her son anyway?

537
00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:33,760
And she's telling me to have a baby?

538
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:38,860
I'd understand if a good parent said that.

539
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:41,990
Anyhow, I'm sorry.

540
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:49,350
I didn't want to show you these things.

541
00:37:52,350 --> 00:37:54,690
But you saw everything today.

542
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:44,650
It'd been better if you told me sooner.

543
00:38:44,650 --> 00:38:49,090
I didn't want to discuss these things since I was young.

544
00:38:49,090 --> 00:38:53,930
My parents' divorce already gives off enough of a broken family smell.

545
00:38:53,930 --> 00:38:56,560
How can a divorce lawyer say such a thing?

546
00:38:56,560 --> 00:39:01,340
Also, why be ashamed when it's not even your fault?

547
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:21,260
Thank you for telling me.

548
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:28,230
You need to tell me these things so I can understand you.

549
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:41,850
To be honest,

550
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:47,350
there's one more thing I didn't tell you.

551
00:39:51,470 --> 00:39:53,420
In fact...

552
00:39:55,010 --> 00:39:58,050
I had a younger sister.

553
00:39:58,050 --> 00:40:00,580
A younger sister?

554
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:05,260
She died in an accident.

555
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:07,580
When she was seven.

556
00:40:08,350 --> 00:40:14,560
But Mom thinks she died because of me.

557
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:17,340
Wh-What...

558
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:18,800
Why?

559
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,680
When we were young,

560
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:23,280
since Mom had to go out to make money...

561
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:26,940
 Brother, let's play together. 

562
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:30,600
 Brother, let's play— 

563
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:37,200
I had to babysit her after school all the time.

564
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:44,350
 Eun Beom, let's play soccer. 

565
00:40:44,350 --> 00:40:46,070
 We need one more person. 

566
00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:49,350
 Seriously, let's play together. 

567
00:40:53,490 --> 00:40:56,480
I was my sister's nanny every day without missing a day.

568
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:59,800
- At that young age. 
  - You need to play without me. 

569
00:41:01,090 --> 00:41:04,820
Can you imagine how tired of it I was?

570
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:07,450
I was only 11, too.

571
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:13,300
   

572
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,490
Then just for once...

573
00:41:45,490 --> 00:41:49,870
I went to play soccer with friends, leaving her alone.

574
00:41:49,870 --> 00:41:50,840
 Eun Beom! 

575
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:53,850
 Hey, hey, block him! 

576
00:41:54,490 --> 00:41:56,730
 Whoa! Kick it! 

577
00:41:56,730 --> 00:41:58,400
 Oh, it went in. 

578
00:42:00,930 --> 00:42:03,370
Just one time.

579
00:42:03,370 --> 00:42:05,950
That was the first time, but...

580
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:11,650
 Brother. 

581
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,370
 Brother... 

582
00:42:14,370 --> 00:42:16,560
On that day...

583
00:42:18,190 --> 00:42:19,890
she came out to look for me...

584
00:42:19,890 --> 00:42:22,500
 Brother... 

585
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:28,490
...and got into an accident.

586
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:34,400
At the crossing in front of our home...

587
00:42:37,610 --> 00:42:40,620
she was hit by an eight-ton truck.

588
00:42:46,250 --> 00:42:48,300
Oh, my...

589
00:43:00,770 --> 00:43:02,610
Eun Beom...

590
00:43:04,510 --> 00:43:07,110
that's not your fault.

591
00:43:07,110 --> 00:43:09,420
You know it, right?

592
00:43:13,410 --> 00:43:16,450
How much of it would I be responsible for?

593
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:19,340
I know, too.

594
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:21,560
That I'm not totally innocent.

595
00:43:22,470 --> 00:43:24,570
But Mom...

596
00:43:28,070 --> 00:43:30,820
kept blaming only me back then.

597
00:44:03,810 --> 00:44:05,500
 You! 

598
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:08,720
 H-How could you... 

599
00:44:10,170 --> 00:44:12,890
 How could... 

600
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:21,380
Eun Beom...

601
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:24,690
Look at me.

602
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:27,780
That's...

603
00:44:28,820 --> 00:44:31,270
not your fault at all.

604
00:44:38,730 --> 00:44:41,400
Mother probably just...

605
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:44,880
did that because she was upset.

606
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:54,250
♫  Still filling my day to its fullest  ♫

607
00:44:54,250 --> 00:45:01,950
♫  I keep repeating your name  ♫

608
00:45:01,950 --> 00:45:10,010
♫  On the street where we walked hand in hand  ♫

609
00:45:10,010 --> 00:45:14,710
♫  I stay alone and think of you  ♫

610
00:45:14,710 --> 00:45:16,720
I know.

611
00:45:17,870 --> 00:45:20,420
♫  Can't have it  ♫

612
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:23,410
Mom probably wanted to blame someone.

613
00:45:23,410 --> 00:45:25,300
That's right.

614
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:26,920
That's it.

615
00:45:28,690 --> 00:45:32,160
Like how I want to blame Mom.

616
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:40,530
♫  Close your eyes and look through them  ♫

617
00:45:40,530 --> 00:45:41,880
♫  Dazzling  ♫

618
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:43,910
However, Ha Ra...

619
00:45:44,810 --> 00:45:47,080
that's why...

620
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:52,130
I don't want to have a baby.

621
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:59,570
It's too scary that a family you can't...

622
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:05,390
cut ties will be created.

623
00:46:07,750 --> 00:46:12,040
♫  Even if I face you  ♫

624
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:19,530
♫  The day I wake up casually  ♫

625
00:46:19,530 --> 00:46:23,360
♫  I will send you  ♫

626
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:31,750
♫  I'll say hello to the past moments  ♫

627
00:46:31,750 --> 00:46:39,850
♫  Then we say, goodbye  ♫

628
00:46:39,850 --> 00:46:42,180
We'll need to drag on the trial as much as possible.

629
00:46:42,180 --> 00:46:45,680
Will will go back by the end of next month because of his visa.

630
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:49,650
Shall we play cheap, keep requesting fact checks, and delay witness examinations?

631
00:46:49,650 --> 00:46:52,680
Yes, let's do that. Since the trial is on the line...

632
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:54,800
he can't just up and leave.

633
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:56,970
Okay.

634
00:46:56,970 --> 00:47:02,290
    
 It will be the final defense today and the verdict on the next court date.

635
00:47:03,490 --> 00:47:08,900
After reading these written statements, I realize our country is really going downhill.

636
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:12,250
There are countless children starving to death worldwide.

637
00:47:12,250 --> 00:47:16,510
Does it make sense to fuss over a dog and spend so much money?

638
00:47:16,510 --> 00:47:19,060
I got angry so many times while reading it!

639
00:47:19,060 --> 00:47:23,060
We can't waste tax money on this ridiculous case.

640
00:47:23,060 --> 00:47:26,800
Therefore, today will be the final defense, and the verdict will be given on the next court date.

641
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:27,850
That's all.

642
00:47:27,850 --> 00:47:29,480
Excuse me, Your Honor.

643
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:31,670
Today's the first day in court,

644
00:47:31,670 --> 00:47:33,910
and we still have a lot of documents we didn't submit.

645
00:47:33,910 --> 00:47:35,960
We need at least two or three more dates.

646
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:40,070
Defense... didn't you hear what I said?

647
00:47:40,070 --> 00:47:41,160
I heard you.

648
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:43,380
To decide where a dog should live,

649
00:47:43,380 --> 00:47:47,800
must you lavishly waste precious tax money?

650
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:49,540
Pardon me, Your Honor.

651
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:55,360
I'm sorry, but we're also citizens, including our client, who pays taxes.

652
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:58,320
Even if you don't like the case,

653
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:02,040
don't we have the right to a proper legal service?

654
00:48:03,100 --> 00:48:05,130
Defense...

655
00:48:06,090 --> 00:48:08,520
Attorney Seo Han Gil?

656
00:48:10,890 --> 00:48:13,930
What class are you in? At the judicial training institute.

657
00:48:15,530 --> 00:48:20,250
- Wait, why are you— 
 - Which terrible class are you a part of?

658
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:30,410
How can a judge be such a fogey?

659
00:48:30,410 --> 00:48:34,900
I thought I was back in the 80s on a time machine.

660
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:36,900
He was notorious in Jeju Courts for being a bunker.

661
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:39,610
Gosh... 
    

662
00:48:39,610 --> 00:48:42,430
We just had to get a bunker, huh?

663
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:49,340
He probably gave another date to prevent any complaints, right?

664
00:48:49,340 --> 00:48:50,980
He seemed to have decided already.

665
00:48:50,980 --> 00:48:55,770
Stop saying such a weak thing, full of defeat.

666
00:48:55,770 --> 00:48:59,540
Don't you have a final resort that can turn the tables here?

667
00:48:59,540 --> 00:49:02,300
If you don't have one, come up with one! We need one, no matter what!

668
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:06,970
Wait!  Why would I be the one to do that? I did my work here.

669
00:49:06,970 --> 00:49:13,330
You're the one who angered the fogey judge by talking about the legal service.

670
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:20,070
What's up? Aren't you getting off?

671
00:49:20,070 --> 00:49:23,480
Where are you going? Where are you going?

672
00:49:25,690 --> 00:49:28,670
- Excuse me, Your Honor. 
 - Hey, there.

673
00:49:28,670 --> 00:49:31,100
- What's the matter? 
 - I'm sorry.

674
00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:35,200
I haven't worked in a courtroom for a long time, so I lacked a better sense of judgment.

675
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:38,310
I'm sorry. I thought I must apologize.

676
00:49:38,310 --> 00:49:43,140
Gosh, seriously, people will misunderstand.

677
00:49:43,140 --> 00:49:44,040
Oh, okay.

678
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:46,600
You were the 21st class when I checked.

679
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:50,690
You're my senior, so if you come in private like this...

680
00:49:50,690 --> 00:49:54,060
it puts pressure on your junior.

681
00:49:56,540 --> 00:49:58,100
I'm sorry.

682
00:49:58,100 --> 00:50:01,200
I was going to leave right after apologizing.

683
00:50:01,210 --> 00:50:04,350
Okay. I'll just say you apologized.

684
00:50:04,350 --> 00:50:07,010
So be careful next time.

685
00:50:07,010 --> 00:50:10,870
The slip of the tongue. It's best if you don't slip up.

686
00:50:10,870 --> 00:50:13,420
You're old enough to know that.

687
00:50:13,420 --> 00:50:15,620
It makes us both awkward.

688
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:24,700
Please take care.

689
00:50:39,740 --> 00:50:41,650
That rotten bastard.

690
00:50:42,470 --> 00:50:44,170
Damn you!

691
00:50:46,030 --> 00:50:50,060
I hope your computer crashes every time you write a verdict!

692
00:50:50,060 --> 00:50:54,860
And I hope your packages never get delivered!

693
00:50:55,910 --> 00:50:58,590
Gosh, what a wretch.

694
00:50:59,940 --> 00:51:02,720
Whoa, that's insane.

695
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:04,840
He went in person to apologize?

696
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:08,920
Yes, he waited for an hour to meet him in the parking lot.

697
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:12,570
Gosh, I'm not sure if His Highness the Judge is feeling better.

698
00:51:12,570 --> 00:51:16,140
CEO Seo was from a training institute's older class, too.

699
00:51:16,140 --> 00:51:17,880
Whoa, CEO Seo...

700
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:21,520
He should just lose the case. It's insulting.

701
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:23,860
He'd have lost it if it was his case.

702
00:51:23,860 --> 00:51:26,460
But it's his wife's.

703
00:51:26,460 --> 00:51:28,720
Gosh, a hopeless romantic.

704
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:31,240
Why do we have so many romantics in our office?

705
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:34,620
I thought I was the hopeless romantic, but I can't even compete.

706
00:51:34,620 --> 00:51:39,890
- CEO Seo and Kwon Si Wook— 
 - Even so, you're the original.

707
00:51:39,890 --> 00:51:43,960
Gosh... I'd like to step off.

708
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:46,660
Why? Is something wrong?

709
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:51,400
Unni, you know...

710
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:54,150
about Eun Beom and me...

711
00:51:54,150 --> 00:51:56,180
- We might— 
 - Aren't you done yet?

712
00:51:56,180 --> 00:51:57,650
- Whoa! 
 - H-Hey!

713
00:51:57,650 --> 00:51:59,360
Wait a second. Gosh.

714
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:01,080
Are you okay?

715
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:02,100
Yeah...

716
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:06,790
Did you get hurt?

717
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:09,910
Wait, wait. I'll do it. Stay put.

718
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:15,940
It's everywhere.

719
00:52:25,690 --> 00:52:26,760
Oh, you're home?

720
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:30,410
Gosh, you worked so hard.

721
00:52:30,410 --> 00:52:32,990
- Even when you're pregnant— 
 - Yes, yes.

722
00:52:32,990 --> 00:52:36,320
Oh, that's right. Did something happen between Oh and Goo?

723
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:39,320
Why? Were they bothering you again?

724
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:40,650
That's not it.

725
00:52:40,650 --> 00:52:43,350
What is it, then? Did Attorney Oh not prepare properly

726
00:52:43,350 --> 00:52:46,460
- for the trial tomorrow— 
 - No, no. That's not it.

727
00:52:46,460 --> 00:52:48,950
Just pretend you heard nothing.

728
00:52:51,940 --> 00:52:54,920
How could I unhear what I heard?

729
00:52:58,070 --> 00:52:59,510
What did you say?

730
00:53:00,470 --> 00:53:02,510
I love you.

731
00:53:07,540 --> 00:53:09,070
Love.

732
00:53:17,180 --> 00:53:19,040
Geez.

733
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:23,450
    
 The fourth exhibit is the records from the vet.

734
00:53:23,450 --> 00:53:29,620
As you can see, Kim Mi Ok's signature is on most of the documents—

735
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:35,930
The fifth exhibit is an online payment history.

736
00:53:35,930 --> 00:53:41,380
It's to prove that the defendant searched for and ordered items for Charlie.

737
00:53:41,380 --> 00:53:44,990
Therefore, besides materialist support, you can see

738
00:53:44,990 --> 00:53:49,270
- that most of the support led by the defendant— 
 - Okay, I get it.

739
00:53:49,270 --> 00:53:53,430
I got it, and this is all from the defendant. Right?

740
00:53:53,430 --> 00:53:55,530
- Yes. 
 - You can stop explaining and

741
00:53:55,530 --> 00:53:56,780
let's move on quickly.

742
00:53:56,780 --> 00:54:00,440
I need to check these myself again anyway.

743
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:02,180
All right, Plaintiff.

744
00:54:02,180 --> 00:54:06,160
Is there anything you need to add to the documents from the defendant?

745
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:07,890
Or shall we wrap it up?

746
00:54:07,890 --> 00:54:10,130
There's nothing to add, Your Honor.

747
00:54:10,130 --> 00:54:14,160
I like this speedy progression of the trial.

748
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:19,650
All right, then. This is the end of defenses.

749
00:54:19,650 --> 00:54:24,810
Does anyone wish to provide a final say?

750
00:54:24,810 --> 00:54:26,830
Pardon me, Your Honor.

751
00:54:26,830 --> 00:54:30,690
I'll make it quick and speak for about three minutes.

752
00:54:34,970 --> 00:54:38,360
- Go ahead, then. 
 - Thank you.

753
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:45,410
Your Honor...

754
00:54:46,420 --> 00:54:49,750
what you need to remember about Charlie...

755
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:53,420
is that he's Korea's dog, in fact.

756
00:54:53,420 --> 00:54:57,230
He was born and raised on Korean soil, ran around and played on Korean soil,

757
00:54:57,230 --> 00:55:00,120
and drank from the clean water of Korea.

758
00:55:00,120 --> 00:55:05,050
If such a dog of Korea gets taken to a faraway land,

759
00:55:05,050 --> 00:55:07,200
how nostalgic and

760
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:11,060
how much would it miss Korea's land and water?

761
00:55:11,060 --> 00:55:16,330
Even if he's an animal, I'm sure he has a love for his homeland.

762
00:55:16,330 --> 00:55:20,910
Wouldn't that be why we say a person's not even as good as a dog?

763
00:55:20,910 --> 00:55:23,500
Dogs are such intelligent animals.

764
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:27,780
Your Honor, please allow Charlie—

765
00:55:27,780 --> 00:55:32,560
Oh, by the way, the defendant wanted to name him

766
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:35,490
Ha Neul, actually, instead of Charlie.

767
00:55:35,490 --> 00:55:42,240
Anyhow, please prevent this dog from living the rest of its life

768
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:45,700
in nostalgia for Korea in a faraway land.

769
00:55:45,700 --> 00:55:49,350
He's a dog from Korea who inherited

770
00:55:49,350 --> 00:55:52,370
the spirit of Korea!

771
00:55:54,740 --> 00:55:58,150
Regardless of how much those great Americans

772
00:55:58,150 --> 00:56:01,640
love dogs, talking about animal rights,

773
00:56:01,640 --> 00:56:04,370
Charlie will, for the rest of his life,

774
00:56:04,370 --> 00:56:06,540
miss Korea...

775
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:11,420
the Korean people!

776
00:56:15,350 --> 00:56:23,120
♫  Until the day when the East Sea's waters and  ♫

777
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:31,690
♫  Mt. Baekdu are dry and worn away,  ♫

778
00:56:31,690 --> 00:56:39,720
♫  God protect and preserve us.  ♫

779
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:47,130
♫  Long live our nation!  ♫ 
  (Korea's national anthem) 

780
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:03,780
I fully understand what you mean.

781
00:57:13,530 --> 00:57:17,850
Your patriotic speech was the carefully calculated defense you talked about?

782
00:57:17,850 --> 00:57:20,350
I know full well about people my age.

783
00:57:20,350 --> 00:57:25,210
When you're my age, your heart aches when you hear

784
00:57:25,210 --> 00:57:28,110
the words "Korea" or "mother."

785
00:57:28,110 --> 00:57:29,660
Whoa, this is nonsense.

786
00:57:29,660 --> 00:57:33,350
Just wait and see. According to my research,

787
00:57:33,350 --> 00:57:38,010
he's an exceptionally patriotic human being.

788
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:56,530
 The issue of this litigation is regarding the plaintiff's request to 

789
00:57:56,530 --> 00:57:59,500
 confirm his ownership of the listed animal. 

790
00:57:59,500 --> 00:58:01,660
 In this case, according to the current laws, 

791
00:58:01,660 --> 00:58:05,530
 the legal standing of a pet is that of an object, 

792
00:58:05,530 --> 00:58:09,250
 the verdict will be given according to how assets are divided. 

793
00:58:09,250 --> 00:58:15,270
 As a result, as a conclusion of all the provided circumstances of this case, 

794
00:58:15,270 --> 00:58:19,260
 the contributions made to the said animal are as follows. 

795
00:58:19,260 --> 00:58:25,990
 Plaintiff, 35%, and Defendant, 65%, appropriately. 

796
00:58:25,990 --> 00:58:28,710
 Therefore, the plaintiff's request is... 

797
00:58:28,710 --> 00:58:30,660
    
 Rejected!

798
00:58:30,660 --> 00:58:34,780
Wow, CEO Seo won!

799
00:58:34,780 --> 00:58:39,120
Our ex-fogey's patriotism plan to touch a fogey's soul worked!

800
00:58:39,120 --> 00:58:41,650
Wow, is this the power of love?

801
00:58:41,650 --> 00:58:44,660
Who knew that ridiculous plan would work?

802
00:58:44,660 --> 00:58:48,340
Of course. It's the power of love.

803
00:58:48,340 --> 00:58:52,800
Power of love for your country.

804
00:58:54,620 --> 00:58:56,790
Wow, love for your country.

805
00:58:56,790 --> 00:59:02,530
Even though the sovereignty of the country lies with the people,

806
00:59:02,530 --> 00:59:06,740
this judge displayed an insincere attitude during the trial,

807
00:59:06,740 --> 00:59:09,420
citing his personal preference for the case.

808
00:59:10,790 --> 00:59:13,010
Insincere attitude?

809
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:21,580
Condescending and insincere attitude...

810
00:59:21,580 --> 00:59:22,360
   

811
00:59:25,480 --> 00:59:27,230
   

812
00:59:28,910 --> 00:59:30,530
Yes, Honey.

813
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:33,240
I heard we won.

814
00:59:33,240 --> 00:59:35,650
Thank you so much. It's all thanks to you.

815
00:59:35,650 --> 00:59:37,520
Goodness, don't mention it.

816
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:41,710
 Shall we eat out at a nice place to celebrate this weekend? 

817
00:59:41,710 --> 00:59:42,810
Yes.

818
00:59:43,850 --> 00:59:47,560
Let me also introduce you to my new boyfriend.

819
00:59:50,930 --> 00:59:52,610
Mi Ok...

820
00:59:53,660 --> 00:59:56,580
you already got another man?

821
01:00:01,560 --> 01:00:04,560
He should've loved her while she was around.

822
01:00:04,560 --> 01:00:07,810
When she was around, he paid no attention to her when she struggled.

823
01:00:07,810 --> 01:00:09,910
What's the use of trying to

824
01:00:09,910 --> 01:00:14,210
fix the fences after she got sick and tired of him and left?

825
01:00:14,210 --> 01:00:17,100
Was CEO Seo such a terrible guy?

826
01:00:17,100 --> 01:00:20,820
I can't really imagine. I only saw him after he became better.

827
01:00:20,820 --> 01:00:24,250
Honestly, CEO Seo only got his senses together after the separation.

828
01:00:24,250 --> 01:00:26,910
He was such a fogey before, wasn't he?

829
01:00:26,910 --> 01:00:28,190
Goodness, even so...

830
01:00:28,190 --> 01:00:33,300
he's trying to change his ways after realizing his faults.

831
01:00:33,300 --> 01:00:38,540
My ex-husband still goes around saying the divorce was my fault.

832
01:00:40,100 --> 01:00:42,410
He's such a douchebag.

833
01:00:42,410 --> 01:00:44,850
- CEO Hong... 
 - Yes.

834
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:47,870
Gosh, let's get up now.

835
01:00:47,870 --> 01:00:50,070
- Okay. 
 - Yes.

836
01:00:50,070 --> 01:00:51,630
Oh, leave it. I'll do it.

837
01:00:51,630 --> 01:00:54,590
Goodness, thank you.

838
01:00:56,950 --> 01:01:00,230
I ended things with Ha Ra.

839
01:01:00,230 --> 01:01:02,540
So please let Mom know.

840
01:01:02,540 --> 01:01:05,090
Tell her to never call Ha Ra for anything.

841
01:01:05,090 --> 01:01:07,660
Everything fell apart because of Mom.

842
01:01:07,660 --> 01:01:09,380
Yes.

843
01:01:09,380 --> 01:01:10,980
Okay.

844
01:01:12,250 --> 01:01:15,030
Hey, you two already broke up?

845
01:01:15,030 --> 01:01:17,090
No, it's a long story.

846
01:01:17,090 --> 01:01:19,300
Did you have a fight?

847
01:01:19,300 --> 01:01:22,770
I knew it. Bi Chwi was asking if something was wrong with you two.

848
01:01:22,770 --> 01:01:24,970
Senior Kang did? What did she say?

849
01:01:24,970 --> 01:01:26,880
What else? She asked if something was wrong,

850
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:30,730
so I asked her why she was asking, and she stopped asking.

851
01:01:30,730 --> 01:01:33,150
Ha Ra must've told her something.

852
01:01:35,410 --> 01:01:38,770
But there's nothing wrong between us. Everything's great.

853
01:01:38,770 --> 01:01:40,830
Do you think I'm an idiot?

854
01:01:41,970 --> 01:01:45,470
- Your client is here, Attorney Kwon. 
 - Oh, right! Okay.

855
01:01:45,470 --> 01:01:47,040
Oh, welcome.

856
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:49,330
Please make yourselves comfortable.

857
01:01:49,330 --> 01:01:51,270
- I sent you the money. 
 - Okay.

858
01:01:51,270 --> 01:01:53,250
 Did you two get talk? 

859
01:01:54,350 --> 01:01:55,630
Yes.

860
01:01:58,190 --> 01:02:00,090
Yes, I can talk.

861
01:02:03,300 --> 01:02:04,820
Yes.

862
01:02:07,980 --> 01:02:09,730
What?

863
01:02:11,370 --> 01:02:14,480
How did you find out, Mom—

864
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:17,040
Don't worry. I'll take care of it.

865
01:02:18,250 --> 01:02:20,120
I'm going to convince him.

866
01:02:20,120 --> 01:02:22,450
I said I'll take care of it!

867
01:02:22,450 --> 01:02:26,150
I don't intend to give up, either.

868
01:02:26,150 --> 01:02:30,870
Don't worry, Mom. I'll try convincing him and...

869
01:02:30,870 --> 01:02:34,310
if it doesn't work out, I'll wrap things up myself.

870
01:02:35,380 --> 01:02:38,910
Okay. Okay, I promise.

871
01:02:50,770 --> 01:02:59,310


872
01:03:04,580 --> 01:03:07,160
 Let's end things here. Let's wrap it up. 

873
01:03:07,160 --> 01:03:09,250
 - Why? 
-  I just decided to end things here. 

874
01:03:09,250 --> 01:03:11,900
 I'll pack everything by the end of this month. 

875
01:03:11,900 --> 01:03:13,550
 Don't you know I'm the fifth-generation only son? 

876
01:03:13,550 --> 01:03:15,180
 Head of Family Act was repealed a long time ago. 

877
01:03:15,180 --> 01:03:17,850
 I think I'll have to call off this marriage. 

878
01:03:17,850 --> 01:03:22,700
 Isn't it funny that humans can be this selfish? 

879
01:03:22,700 --> 01:03:23,840
 Si Wook! 

880
01:03:23,840 --> 01:03:25,900
 Hey, Goo Eun Beom! 

881
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:31,500
 Is it a part of a fight, or is this really the end? 

882
01:03:31,540 --> 01:03:35,630
