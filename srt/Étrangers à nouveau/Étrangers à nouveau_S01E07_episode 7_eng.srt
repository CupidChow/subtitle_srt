1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,060


2
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:12,154
   

3
00:00:12,154 --> 00:00:13,214
   

4
00:00:34,114 --> 00:00:36,014
   

5
00:00:39,074 --> 00:00:40,954
   

6
00:00:42,574 --> 00:00:44,474
   

7
00:00:46,814 --> 00:00:48,364
   

8
00:00:49,864 --> 00:00:52,344
Why are you not answering me?

9
00:00:54,044 --> 00:00:58,634
    
 Hey, don't you need to answer Kim Ga Eun over there?

10
00:00:59,524 --> 00:01:03,204
Why does she keep doing this? It's not like she's going to hire me.

11
00:01:03,204 --> 00:01:05,334
Hello. Yes, Ga Eun.

12
00:01:05,334 --> 00:01:06,844
Sorry?

13
00:01:06,844 --> 00:01:09,024
What did you say?

14
00:01:09,684 --> 00:01:11,724
Arrested by the police?

15
00:01:11,724 --> 00:01:13,664
Wait, why...

16
00:01:15,514 --> 00:01:18,464
You stabbed that man with a knife?

17
00:01:18,464 --> 00:01:20,444
Hello? Kim Ga Eun?

18
00:01:20,444 --> 00:01:23,534
What did you do to Oh Dae Hwan? You stabbed him?

19
00:01:25,434 --> 00:01:27,584
Oh Dae Hwan?

20
00:01:28,274 --> 00:01:31,784
No, the one I stabbed is my kid's father...

21
00:01:31,784 --> 00:01:33,974
Kim Eui Cheol...

22
00:01:33,974 --> 00:01:35,514
 Who are you, by the way? 

23
00:01:35,514 --> 00:01:37,774
 Please let me talk to Attorney Oh. 

24
00:01:37,774 --> 00:01:39,554
One moment, please.

25
00:01:42,114 --> 00:01:43,944
She wants to talk to you.

26
00:01:47,414 --> 00:01:49,124
Why does my dad's name come out there?

27
00:01:49,124 --> 00:01:52,184
Whose name? Wh-What are you talking about?

28
00:01:52,184 --> 00:01:54,444
No, you heard wrong.

29
00:01:58,104 --> 00:01:59,764
Yes, Ga Eun...

30
00:01:59,764 --> 00:02:02,140
Well, I'll go to the station,

31
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:04,460
so just say you'll wait for your lawyer.

32
00:02:04,464 --> 00:02:06,974
And say you'll remain silent until then.

33
00:02:06,974 --> 00:02:08,494
Yes.

34
00:02:11,314 --> 00:02:14,054
What are you doing? Get up.

35
00:02:17,914 --> 00:02:19,744
Come with me.

36
00:02:19,744 --> 00:02:21,874
We'll talk on the way.

37
00:02:24,694 --> 00:02:30,194
   

38
00:02:36,014 --> 00:02:40,924
 I just heard shocking news from my ex-husband, whom I had divorced more than two years ago, 

39
00:02:40,924 --> 00:02:46,854
 that my father has had another family over a long period of time. 

40
00:02:46,854 --> 00:02:48,594
 On top of that... 

41
00:02:48,594 --> 00:02:52,474
 I even have a half-sister, apparently. 

42
00:02:52,474 --> 00:02:55,164
 And now, I'm on my way to the police station 

43
00:02:55,164 --> 00:02:58,604
 to defend a scary woman who tried to stab 

44
00:02:58,604 --> 00:03:01,094
 and kill a cowardly man, 

45
00:03:01,094 --> 00:03:04,144
 who's just too much like my father. 

46
00:03:04,144 --> 00:03:08,474
 Could this be a twist of fate, perhaps? 

47
00:03:09,334 --> 00:03:13,034
 It's probably my ex-husband's joke, right? 

48
00:03:13,034 --> 00:03:16,364
 This guy was always pulling jokes. 

49
00:03:16,364 --> 00:03:18,564
You're joking, right?

50
00:03:18,564 --> 00:03:22,614
I mean, does that even make sense?

51
00:03:23,234 --> 00:03:26,264
Your joke went too far.

52
00:03:27,194 --> 00:03:29,404
Tell me you're joking.

53
00:03:37,464 --> 00:03:38,764
It's red light, red light!

54
00:03:38,764 --> 00:03:40,984
No, wait! Wait! Waitâ€”

55
00:03:40,984 --> 00:03:45,834
 After scheming with my ex-father-in-law and my ex-mother-in-law... 

56
00:03:45,834 --> 00:03:48,124
 to fool my ex-wife... 

57
00:03:48,124 --> 00:03:51,824
 I'm tasting the moment of going to hell. 

58
00:03:57,684 --> 00:03:58,714
Please be careful next time.

59
00:03:58,714 --> 00:04:00,910
Okay. I'm sorry. I'll watch out.

60
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:02,740
Please take care.

61
00:04:06,134 --> 00:04:08,684
- What do you want to do? 
 - About what?

62
00:04:08,684 --> 00:04:12,774
Kim Ga Eun is a matter, too, but shouldn't you go to your dad right now?

63
00:04:12,774 --> 00:04:15,314
Father-in-law's situation seemed pretty bad as well.

64
00:04:15,314 --> 00:04:17,694
"Father-in-law?"

65
00:04:17,694 --> 00:04:21,354
It's funny how you call him father-in-law after doing this to me.

66
00:04:21,354 --> 00:04:23,094
Whether it's mister or father-in-law-

67
00:04:23,094 --> 00:04:26,104
What do I do then? Kim Ga Eun is probably waiting for me right now.

68
00:04:26,104 --> 00:04:27,894
Just tell her you can't come because something came up.

69
00:04:27,894 --> 00:04:30,534
So irresponsibly?

70
00:04:30,534 --> 00:04:32,764
Then you think I should go?

71
00:04:35,924 --> 00:04:37,764
You're telling me to go?

72
00:04:37,764 --> 00:04:39,324
Just go there for now and...

73
00:04:39,324 --> 00:04:42,374
look into what happened.

74
00:04:43,934 --> 00:04:45,554
Geez.

75
00:04:47,274 --> 00:04:50,454
Okay, get in the passenger seat.

76
00:04:51,514 --> 00:04:53,224
You can't drive right now.

77
00:04:53,224 --> 00:04:56,304
I'll go to the police station after dropping you off.

78
00:04:56,304 --> 00:04:57,914
So get in.

79
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:07,244
   

80
00:05:28,224 --> 00:05:29,604
The tteokbokki will be so delicious.

81
00:05:29,604 --> 00:05:32,084
Let's hurry up and go.

82
00:05:44,134 --> 00:05:46,664
 I don't know. I just can't reach him lately. 

83
00:05:46,664 --> 00:05:48,184
 Even if he's preparing for graduation... 

84
00:05:48,184 --> 00:05:50,654
 - He must be studying. 
 - No, he isn't. 

85
00:05:50,654 --> 00:05:53,284
 You know how he's not that bright. 

86
00:05:54,214 --> 00:05:56,774
 I'm a little brighter because I take after you? 

87
00:05:59,624 --> 00:06:02,124
Hey, did you hear about Professor Oh Dae Hwan?

88
00:06:02,124 --> 00:06:04,454
Yes. It's so amazing, isn't it?

89
00:06:04,454 --> 00:06:05,944
He's seriously insane.

90
00:06:05,944 --> 00:06:07,424
    
 Isn't he even ashamed?

91
00:06:07,424 --> 00:06:09,894
Seriously, how embarrassing.

92
00:06:09,894 --> 00:06:12,824
   

93
00:06:19,394 --> 00:06:22,254
I explained so you can understand, but...

94
00:06:22,254 --> 00:06:25,194
you just had to go and shame me like this?

95
00:06:26,994 --> 00:06:31,024
Just wait and see! I'll sue you for defamation!

96
00:06:32,174 --> 00:06:34,574
Ha Ra, you...

97
00:06:35,474 --> 00:06:39,224
Oh, wh-what brings you h-here?

98
00:06:39,224 --> 00:06:41,284
Defamation?

99
00:06:41,284 --> 00:06:43,634
Are you going to sue someone, Dad?

100
00:06:45,834 --> 00:06:49,184
N-No, it's n-nothing.

101
00:06:49,184 --> 00:06:53,134
M-More than that, wh-what brings you here without a call?

102
00:06:53,134 --> 00:06:56,674
What do you mean it's nothing? It was something.

103
00:06:57,394 --> 00:07:03,024
The rumor is all over the school that my dad is the scum of the earth.

104
00:07:03,024 --> 00:07:05,134
That's nothing to you?

105
00:07:07,634 --> 00:07:10,034
   

106
00:07:11,544 --> 00:07:15,654
You don't plan to ask me to take that litigation, do you?

107
00:07:15,654 --> 00:07:20,284
I'm sorry, but find another lawyer since I don't think I can.

108
00:07:20,284 --> 00:07:24,724
I need to help my mom with her divorce lawsuit, so I'll be busy.

109
00:07:28,284 --> 00:07:30,024
H-Ha Ra...

110
00:07:34,434 --> 00:07:39,344
   

111
00:07:39,344 --> 00:07:43,294
Attorney Oh just told me she might not make it.

112
00:07:43,294 --> 00:07:45,444
But she said she'll come.

113
00:07:45,444 --> 00:07:48,834
She can't come because of a personal matter.

114
00:07:48,834 --> 00:07:50,504
What about me, then?

115
00:07:50,504 --> 00:07:55,384
I trusted her and waited for Attorney Oh because she said she'd come.

116
00:07:55,384 --> 00:07:58,014
Are there any other lawyers you know?

117
00:07:59,694 --> 00:08:02,094
You don't, huh?

118
00:08:02,094 --> 00:08:05,074
I came for now since I work at the same law firm, but...

119
00:08:05,074 --> 00:08:09,624
I don't think I should take this case and proceed with it.

120
00:08:09,624 --> 00:08:13,184
I'll introduce you to other lawyers who specialize in criminal law.

121
00:08:14,054 --> 00:08:16,254
Oh, this guy is okay.

122
00:08:18,274 --> 00:08:20,354
Oh, and this guy...

123
00:08:20,354 --> 00:08:22,534
is capable but also affordable.

124
00:08:22,534 --> 00:08:23,934
He opened his office recently.

125
00:08:23,934 --> 00:08:27,034
Please get me Attorney Oh.

126
00:08:27,034 --> 00:08:28,704
I...

127
00:08:28,704 --> 00:08:30,424
I can't do without Attorney Oh.

128
00:08:30,424 --> 00:08:32,194
I told you she can't because of a personal matter.

129
00:08:32,194 --> 00:08:35,594
How bad is her personal matter? Is it more urgent than mine?

130
00:08:35,594 --> 00:08:38,344
Of course, it is. If it wasn't urgent...

131
00:08:38,344 --> 00:08:40,104
she would've come.

132
00:08:40,914 --> 00:08:43,944
In that case... let me talk to her on the phone.

133
00:08:43,944 --> 00:08:46,204
I'll try talking to her.

134
00:08:48,774 --> 00:08:51,864
Do you have to have Attorney Oh take this case?

135
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:53,344
Yes...

136
00:08:53,344 --> 00:08:55,954
I think I'll be relieved only if...

137
00:08:55,954 --> 00:08:58,714
Attorney Oh takes the case.

138
00:09:01,174 --> 00:09:03,524
Instead of Attorney Oh,

139
00:09:03,524 --> 00:09:07,464
what will you do if a skilled lawyer with a 100% winning rate on

140
00:09:07,464 --> 00:09:10,784
criminal cases said he'd take your case?

141
00:09:12,144 --> 00:09:14,804
Who would that be?

142
00:09:15,744 --> 00:09:18,004
Please cut it out.

143
00:09:18,004 --> 00:09:21,434
You won two out of two cases by luck.

144
00:09:21,434 --> 00:09:23,604
Won 100% of cases?

145
00:09:23,604 --> 00:09:25,724
What a blatant lie.

146
00:09:25,724 --> 00:09:27,714
How is that a lie?

147
00:09:27,714 --> 00:09:29,134
It isn't false, is it?

148
00:09:29,134 --> 00:09:31,884
I got it. Did you already sign the contract?

149
00:09:31,884 --> 00:09:34,624
Yes, right here.

150
00:09:34,624 --> 00:09:38,244
By the way, why are you into criminal law all of a sudden?

151
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:39,614
Well, I just thought...

152
00:09:39,614 --> 00:09:44,614
I should try at least one attempted murder case as a lawyer.

153
00:09:44,614 --> 00:09:48,024
Bullshit. You're watching American dramas lately, aren't you?

154
00:09:48,024 --> 00:09:50,234
He's not entirely wrong.

155
00:09:51,044 --> 00:09:54,994
A lawyer in an American drama I watched said this yesterday.

156
00:09:55,924 --> 00:10:00,484
"Where blood, money, and affair exist...

157
00:10:02,464 --> 00:10:07,134
that is the place a true lawyer belongs."

158
00:10:07,134 --> 00:10:10,364
That's what I'm talking about.

159
00:10:11,604 --> 00:10:13,734
Attempted murder, huh?

160
00:10:13,734 --> 00:10:15,984
- Sounds like it'll be interesting. 
 - Right?

161
00:10:15,984 --> 00:10:21,834
CEO Seo... do you want to do a joint defense with me on this?

162
00:10:22,534 --> 00:10:25,054
Pow, pow, pow!

163
00:10:26,064 --> 00:10:27,914
Pow, pow, pow, pow!

164
00:10:27,914 --> 00:10:30,794
Ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh.

165
00:10:32,014 --> 00:10:33,134
Bring me the file.

166
00:10:33,134 --> 00:10:34,994
Okay.

167
00:10:34,994 --> 00:10:36,864
Like this...

168
00:10:36,864 --> 00:10:39,584
She stabbed him once and froze.

169
00:10:39,584 --> 00:10:41,644
Then someone just arrived at the elevator, and...

170
00:10:41,644 --> 00:10:44,394
started screaming like this, so...

171
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:46,164
she ran away because she was startled.

172
00:10:46,164 --> 00:10:48,424
- She ran away? 
 - Yes.

173
00:10:48,424 --> 00:10:52,634
The evidence, the witness, and the black boxes were all there at the scene anyway,

174
00:10:52,634 --> 00:10:54,944
She should've turned herself in instead of running.

175
00:10:54,944 --> 00:10:56,034
You can't understand, can you?

176
00:10:56,034 --> 00:10:58,144
She was arrested not too far from the scene?

177
00:10:58,144 --> 00:10:59,454
Yes.

178
00:10:59,454 --> 00:11:03,164
She couldn't deny it because of the victim's blood on her clothes.

179
00:11:03,164 --> 00:11:07,274
The guy was taken to the hospital, but since the wound wasn't deep,

180
00:11:07,274 --> 00:11:10,534
it doesn't seem life-threatening.

181
00:11:10,534 --> 00:11:12,224
Yes.

182
00:11:13,184 --> 00:11:15,324
What the heck? This is anti-climatic.

183
00:11:15,324 --> 00:11:17,524
Hey, it's not even a question of pleading guilty or not.

184
00:11:17,524 --> 00:11:19,674
It's either attempted murder or assault with a deadly weapon.

185
00:11:19,674 --> 00:11:22,884
But we'll claim there was no murderous intent.

186
00:11:22,884 --> 00:11:26,054
In that case, it's a first offense...

187
00:11:26,054 --> 00:11:28,764
the criminal motivation will be taken into account.

188
00:11:28,764 --> 00:11:31,724
After showing enough signs of remorse and...

189
00:11:31,724 --> 00:11:34,534
convince the victim to settle on an agreement...

190
00:11:34,534 --> 00:11:37,384
it'll be anywhere from a mere probation

191
00:11:37,384 --> 00:11:40,214
to three or four years, at most.

192
00:11:40,214 --> 00:11:43,534
You get the picture just from reading the statement.

193
00:11:43,534 --> 00:11:44,994
Gosh, how disappointing.

194
00:11:44,994 --> 00:11:47,324
- I'm not doing it. 
 - Huh?

195
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:50,634
Should there have been more of it?

196
00:11:50,634 --> 00:11:53,184
- Of what? 
 - Blood.

197
00:11:53,184 --> 00:11:55,514
I'm not doing it. Get out.

198
00:11:59,324 --> 00:12:01,714
How ridiculous.

199
00:12:08,414 --> 00:12:10,124
What are you doing? Pack your clothes.

200
00:12:10,124 --> 00:12:11,324
Just for the time being.

201
00:12:11,324 --> 00:12:14,404
I'm not getting a divorce. I told you over the phone.

202
00:12:14,404 --> 00:12:17,164
Why won't you get a divorce?

203
00:12:17,164 --> 00:12:18,524
Are you crazy?

204
00:12:18,524 --> 00:12:21,314
You want to live under the same roof as that brute?

205
00:12:21,314 --> 00:12:23,484
There's a limit to how nice you can be.

206
00:12:23,484 --> 00:12:28,394
You're not being nice here you're being foolish!

207
00:12:28,394 --> 00:12:29,844
Are you afraid of the aunts?

208
00:12:29,844 --> 00:12:32,774
- You don't need to worry about themâ€” 
 - It's not like that.

209
00:12:32,774 --> 00:12:35,634
Your aunts are telling me to break up with him.

210
00:12:35,634 --> 00:12:39,614
They said they'll give me everything, the house, and the car.

211
00:12:39,614 --> 00:12:41,354
That's good to hear.

212
00:12:41,354 --> 00:12:43,554
Just take them and break up, nice and neat.

213
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:46,064
What's the problem?

214
00:12:46,064 --> 00:12:47,534
Someone once said this.

215
00:12:47,534 --> 00:12:50,654
Breaking up with someone who had an affair...

216
00:12:50,654 --> 00:12:54,424
is basically blessing the two of them with happiness.

217
00:12:57,884 --> 00:13:03,314
Are you telling me to die a lonely death while watching the two of them live happily?

218
00:13:04,644 --> 00:13:07,764
I... I absolutely won't.

219
00:13:07,764 --> 00:13:10,534
I'm going to keep him by my side until I die.

220
00:13:10,534 --> 00:13:14,234
So you can just act like nothing's wrong.

221
00:13:14,234 --> 00:13:17,044
Do you think that's possible?

222
00:13:29,664 --> 00:13:31,534
All right.

223
00:13:33,564 --> 00:13:36,244
As you said, keep Dad by your side until you die.

224
00:13:36,244 --> 00:13:38,374
That's fine, then.

225
00:13:39,434 --> 00:13:40,694
But...

226
00:13:41,504 --> 00:13:44,434
don't contact me even if you two die!

227
00:13:44,434 --> 00:13:47,534
- Ha Ra... 
 - Don't you dare follow me!

228
00:13:50,804 --> 00:13:52,944
Ha Ra!

229
00:14:06,054 --> 00:14:07,734
And then...

230
00:14:07,734 --> 00:14:12,674
I got over 10 missed calls from my mom.

231
00:14:12,674 --> 00:14:13,924
But I didn't answer a single call.

232
00:14:13,924 --> 00:14:17,204
Hey, even so, you're her child. That's being too harshâ€”

233
00:14:17,204 --> 00:14:18,974
Shut up and listen.

234
00:14:20,304 --> 00:14:24,434
Do you know how absurd my dad is?

235
00:14:24,434 --> 00:14:28,234
That man said he'll... sue her for...

236
00:14:28,234 --> 00:14:33,254
defamation because she put up posters at his school.

237
00:14:33,254 --> 00:14:35,494
So I said this.

238
00:14:35,494 --> 00:14:38,004
Defamation?

239
00:14:38,714 --> 00:14:42,064
Who are you going to ask to do it?

240
00:14:42,064 --> 00:14:45,024
Because I'm too busy.

241
00:14:45,024 --> 00:14:49,074
I need to help my mom with her divorce...

242
00:14:58,084 --> 00:14:59,884
Laugh.

243
00:15:06,004 --> 00:15:08,144
Gosh, I'm about to lose it.

244
00:15:08,144 --> 00:15:11,394
How do you come up with lines like that?

245
00:15:12,424 --> 00:15:15,254
Just laugh only.

246
00:15:15,254 --> 00:15:17,394
Don't overreact.

247
00:15:34,464 --> 00:15:35,984
Oh, my gosh.

248
00:15:35,984 --> 00:15:37,804
You don't look human.

249
00:15:37,804 --> 00:15:39,954
Look who's talking.

250
00:15:46,574 --> 00:15:49,774
Man, I'm in trouble.

251
00:15:49,774 --> 00:15:51,964
I think I have a terminal illness.

252
00:15:51,964 --> 00:15:55,614
- My hangover is lasting three days. 
 - Stop drinking.

253
00:15:55,614 --> 00:15:57,534
Your body is protesting now.

254
00:15:57,534 --> 00:15:59,754
Asking you to spare its life.

255
00:16:00,394 --> 00:16:02,874
What about you? Who did you drink that much with last night?

256
00:16:02,874 --> 00:16:04,084
With Goo Eun Beom.

257
00:16:04,084 --> 00:16:06,214
Are you best friends or something?

258
00:16:06,214 --> 00:16:08,684
You drank that much with your ex-husband, not even a boyfriend?

259
00:16:08,684 --> 00:16:11,134
I had my reasons.

260
00:16:14,574 --> 00:16:16,544
We'll talk later.

261
00:16:21,894 --> 00:16:23,194
   
 Okay. 

262
00:16:23,194 --> 00:16:25,634
 I'll get a divorce, as you said. 

263
00:16:25,634 --> 00:16:27,344
 What do I need to prepare? 

264
00:16:27,344 --> 00:16:29,534
 Oh, my god... 

265
00:16:31,524 --> 00:16:32,874
All of a sudden?

266
00:16:32,874 --> 00:16:35,704
She thought about it all night, not even sleeping.

267
00:16:35,704 --> 00:16:38,124
And she thinks getting a divorce is right after all.

268
00:16:39,464 --> 00:16:40,524
Thank you.

269
00:16:40,524 --> 00:16:41,464
So what?

270
00:16:41,464 --> 00:16:43,254
What do you mean, "so what?"

271
00:16:43,254 --> 00:16:46,024
I told her to prepare the documents.

272
00:16:46,024 --> 00:16:49,544
Did she tell your father? That she wants a divorce?

273
00:16:49,544 --> 00:16:51,594
She asked me to tell him.

274
00:16:51,594 --> 00:16:54,594
Since she thinks she'll get a soft heart.

275
00:16:58,764 --> 00:17:02,574
You don't think... Dad will file a lawsuit, do you?

276
00:17:02,574 --> 00:17:05,584
He wouldn't get that low, would he?

277
00:17:05,584 --> 00:17:07,434
No way.

278
00:17:10,934 --> 00:17:12,984
You're busy, right?

279
00:17:12,984 --> 00:17:16,254
I complained too much to a busy guy.

280
00:17:16,254 --> 00:17:18,174
My head was just too clustered.

281
00:17:18,174 --> 00:17:21,064
This... Kim Ga Eun's case...

282
00:17:21,064 --> 00:17:23,654
will most likely get handed over to the prosecution this week.

283
00:17:23,654 --> 00:17:27,174
So I need to prepare the written opinion as soon as possible.

284
00:17:27,174 --> 00:17:28,924
Right...

285
00:17:28,924 --> 00:17:31,994
Hey, you took that case yourself?

286
00:17:31,994 --> 00:17:33,934
It happened that way.

287
00:17:33,934 --> 00:17:36,194
What happened to the man who got stabbed? Is he alive?

288
00:17:36,194 --> 00:17:38,724
- He's not dead, is he? 
 - He's alive.

289
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:41,144
She couldn't even stab him that deeply.

290
00:17:41,144 --> 00:17:43,644
Oh, thank god.

291
00:17:46,064 --> 00:17:47,454
I'm sorry for that.

292
00:17:47,454 --> 00:17:49,334
Forget it.

293
00:17:50,394 --> 00:17:52,034
It's fine!

294
00:17:52,034 --> 00:17:55,834
Well, you were begging me to take it.

295
00:17:55,834 --> 00:17:58,134
I get to make money, so it's fine.

296
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:07,504
Thank you.

297
00:18:29,604 --> 00:18:31,924
Gosh, seriously...

298
00:19:13,044 --> 00:19:16,054
You're not planning to... file a lawsuit

299
00:19:16,054 --> 00:19:18,184
when your daughter is a lawyer, are you?

300
00:19:18,184 --> 00:19:20,344
Organize your documents and end it with an agreed divorce.

301
00:19:20,344 --> 00:19:22,814
I roughly organized the list of assets.

302
00:19:22,814 --> 00:19:25,314
Let me know if anything's missing.

303
00:19:30,574 --> 00:19:32,414
Don't look at me like that!

304
00:19:32,414 --> 00:19:34,434
You saw this coming.

305
00:19:34,434 --> 00:19:37,124
Did you think we'd keep living with you?

306
00:19:42,064 --> 00:19:44,774
Stop acting like you're the victim.

307
00:19:44,774 --> 00:19:48,544
Mom is the victim, not you...

308
00:19:48,544 --> 00:19:50,544
It's Mom and me.

309
00:19:50,544 --> 00:19:52,414
Got that?

310
00:20:05,114 --> 00:20:06,194
Ha Ra.

311
00:20:06,194 --> 00:20:07,434
Dadâ€”

312
00:20:07,434 --> 00:20:09,664
Are you out of your mind?

313
00:20:10,764 --> 00:20:12,794
Ha Ra, please.

314
00:20:12,794 --> 00:20:14,884
What's wrong with you?

315
00:20:15,484 --> 00:20:18,804
Get up. Get upâ€”

316
00:20:18,804 --> 00:20:20,774
People are staring.

317
00:20:20,774 --> 00:20:22,064
Please...

318
00:20:22,064 --> 00:20:23,984
Get up. Get

319
00:20:23,984 --> 00:20:25,594
Ha Ra.

320
00:20:29,634 --> 00:20:30,754
Ha Ra...

321
00:20:30,754 --> 00:20:33,944
Gosh, I'm going nuts.

322
00:20:45,924 --> 00:20:48,274
That's really insane.

323
00:20:48,274 --> 00:20:50,964
Gosh, how's he so alike?

324
00:20:50,964 --> 00:20:53,134
My second stepdad was just like that.

325
00:20:53,134 --> 00:20:56,634
The second one, not the first one.

326
00:20:56,634 --> 00:20:59,514
He knelt before mom, clinging to her in tears...

327
00:20:59,514 --> 00:21:02,784
and acted like he was the victim, but...

328
00:21:04,094 --> 00:21:07,034
he was actually hiding his assets.

329
00:21:12,634 --> 00:21:17,534
Of course, Mom's attorney went and got a hold of all of them.

330
00:21:19,484 --> 00:21:20,764
Honey...

331
00:21:20,764 --> 00:21:23,304
you can't be getting soft-hearted. Okay?

332
00:21:23,304 --> 00:21:28,364
Don't be fooled by that and you need to push through like a serpent.

333
00:21:28,364 --> 00:21:30,524
You think he seems regretful, right?

334
00:21:30,524 --> 00:21:32,944
Nope. He'll never regret it.

335
00:21:32,944 --> 00:21:37,114
Even at that moment, a person thinks about how to make it out alive.

336
00:21:42,974 --> 00:21:44,634
Hey, Goo Eun Beom!

337
00:21:44,634 --> 00:21:48,034
Wow, have you been well?

338
00:21:48,034 --> 00:21:50,414
Yes, doing okay.

339
00:21:50,414 --> 00:21:51,874
Who knew we'd meet like this?

340
00:21:51,874 --> 00:21:52,744
I know.

341
00:21:52,744 --> 00:21:54,864
You never hit me up, not even once.

342
00:21:54,864 --> 00:21:58,134
We're not that close, are we?

343
00:21:58,134 --> 00:21:59,834
No, what I'm saying is...

344
00:21:59,834 --> 00:22:01,454
I'm the prosecutor in charge.

345
00:22:01,454 --> 00:22:03,334
Don't people usually give you a call?

346
00:22:03,334 --> 00:22:06,244
You're really something else.

347
00:22:07,734 --> 00:22:09,734
You don't still think...

348
00:22:09,734 --> 00:22:13,504
I have feelings for Oh Ha Ra, do you?

349
00:22:15,034 --> 00:22:17,684
I heard about your divorce.

350
00:22:17,684 --> 00:22:20,184
Hey, I have something called a conscience.

351
00:22:20,184 --> 00:22:23,314
I have no intention of pursuing my colleague's ex-wife.

352
00:22:23,314 --> 00:22:24,394
All right, all right.

353
00:22:24,394 --> 00:22:28,144
If our old history makes you uncomfortable, I'll go ahead.

354
00:22:28,144 --> 00:22:30,024
Jin Won...

355
00:22:30,634 --> 00:22:31,974
Yes.

356
00:22:31,974 --> 00:22:34,374
I usually don't take criminal cases, so...

357
00:22:34,374 --> 00:22:38,144
I didn't know I had to say hi to the public trial prosecutor separately.

358
00:22:38,144 --> 00:22:40,454
- Had I known, I would've done it first thing. 
 - Hey!

359
00:22:40,454 --> 00:22:42,874
I'm not the type to shy away from things like that.

360
00:22:42,874 --> 00:22:44,944
You know as well as I do.

361
00:22:46,104 --> 00:22:48,614
Oh, hey, that's right.

362
00:22:48,614 --> 00:22:50,874
Hey, I should've sold Ha Ra's name. Right?

363
00:22:50,874 --> 00:22:55,294
I had totally forgotten how you were trying so hard to get her.

364
00:22:55,294 --> 00:22:59,614
I remembered because you said it yourself.

365
00:23:00,934 --> 00:23:06,454
Hey, I would've introduced you to her only if Ha Ra didn't have a boyfriend.

366
00:23:08,034 --> 00:23:09,524
You know, feelings are always...

367
00:23:09,524 --> 00:23:13,994
coming and going, or going and coming, aren't they?

368
00:23:16,474 --> 00:23:18,384
Aren't you going?

369
00:23:23,824 --> 00:23:25,524
That punk...

370
00:23:27,234 --> 00:23:32,664
Defendant Kim Ga Eun... thoroughly planned to murder the victim, Kim Eui Cheol,

371
00:23:32,664 --> 00:23:34,914
when he didn't change his mind

372
00:23:34,914 --> 00:23:38,704
rather than regretting her shameful act of adultery.

373
00:23:38,704 --> 00:23:43,984
This kind of behavior... is a critically grave crime that shakes the fundamentals of society.

374
00:23:43,984 --> 00:23:48,484
She also has a grave responsibility for destroying a family.

375
00:23:48,484 --> 00:23:51,294
As such, the prosecution is hereby bringing

376
00:23:51,294 --> 00:23:54,364
an indictment on this case to the said defendant.

377
00:23:56,294 --> 00:23:57,324
Defendant?

378
00:23:57,324 --> 00:23:59,674
Do you admit the prosecution's indictment cause?

379
00:23:59,674 --> 00:24:03,774
No, the defendant did not plan to murder the victim.

380
00:24:03,774 --> 00:24:05,654
Thus it was not attempted murder.

381
00:24:05,654 --> 00:24:07,884
We claim assault with a deadly weapon.

382
00:24:07,884 --> 00:24:11,644
Also, you did write a good indictment, but it's a bit long.

383
00:24:11,644 --> 00:24:15,884
I didn't think you'd read all this here, but you did, which surprised me.

384
00:24:15,884 --> 00:24:19,914
From now on, please summarize what's been submitted through text.

385
00:24:19,914 --> 00:24:23,984
The judges and I alike are all busy people here.

386
00:24:26,074 --> 00:24:29,284
Please submit your evidence.

387
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:33,904
I'll be proceeding with the trial, Attorney.

388
00:24:33,904 --> 00:24:35,634
Oh, yes.

389
00:24:40,904 --> 00:24:42,884
   

390
00:24:44,434 --> 00:24:46,834
Please go ahead with evidence admittance.

391
00:24:50,050 --> 00:24:52,100
This is the list of evidence.

392
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:54,340
We admit to the first three and deny the rest.

393
00:24:55,864 --> 00:24:57,584
What?

394
00:24:58,334 --> 00:25:02,104
- You can't use your phone during the trial. 
 - H-He died, Your Honor.

395
00:25:07,404 --> 00:25:09,754
My husband...

396
00:25:10,374 --> 00:25:12,354
died.

397
00:25:23,864 --> 00:25:25,844
Jin Yi!

398
00:25:28,984 --> 00:25:32,124
   

399
00:25:32,124 --> 00:25:35,314
Yes, Mom. Do you have time today?

400
00:25:35,314 --> 00:25:38,884
I finished filling out the application to divorce by agreement.

401
00:25:38,884 --> 00:25:42,074
I just need your and Dad's signature stamps on it.

402
00:25:42,724 --> 00:25:45,774
Oh, what about tomorrow?

403
00:25:47,044 --> 00:25:50,384
Should I go on the weekend?

404
00:25:50,384 --> 00:25:54,994
No... I'm not rushing you right nowâ€”

405
00:25:56,354 --> 00:25:58,834
Okay. Okay!

406
00:25:58,854 --> 00:26:00,324
Yeah.

407
00:26:09,864 --> 00:26:11,394
I'm going offsite.

408
00:26:11,394 --> 00:26:13,734
 Okay, take care. 

409
00:26:22,274 --> 00:26:24,914
Attorney Oh! Do you need something copied?

410
00:26:24,914 --> 00:26:29,384
O-Oh, no, Mr. Seong. It's just a single copy, so I can do it.

411
00:26:32,254 --> 00:26:34,864
   

412
00:26:38,174 --> 00:26:40,994
All right, Attorney Goo.

413
00:26:40,994 --> 00:26:43,274
Just one copy of the death certificate?

414
00:26:43,274 --> 00:26:46,354
Okay.

415
00:26:47,564 --> 00:26:50,264
Why? What death certificate?

416
00:26:50,264 --> 00:26:52,834
You know the case Attorney Goo took?

417
00:26:52,834 --> 00:26:56,864
The victim who was stabbed died just now.

418
00:26:56,864 --> 00:26:58,534
What?

419
00:27:01,864 --> 00:27:04,054
What? Who died?

420
00:27:04,054 --> 00:27:05,664
Kim Eui Cheol.

421
00:27:05,664 --> 00:27:08,004
Wait, that's so sudden.

422
00:27:08,534 --> 00:27:13,734
Attorney Oh, then, Attorney Goo's trial is now doomed, isn't it?

423
00:27:26,984 --> 00:27:30,634
The prosecution applied to change the indictment.

424
00:27:30,634 --> 00:27:33,754
You're about to be indicted for murder now.

425
00:27:35,234 --> 00:27:38,354
Why did Kim Eui Cheol all of a sudden...

426
00:27:38,354 --> 00:27:40,494
They said his life wasn't threatened...

427
00:27:40,494 --> 00:27:43,504
and he was in a stable condition, for sure.

428
00:27:46,514 --> 00:27:50,374
Did he have a chronic illness or something?

429
00:27:50,374 --> 00:27:52,444
I wished for him to die.

430
00:27:52,444 --> 00:27:54,744
So I'm glad.

431
00:27:54,744 --> 00:27:57,764
Is that something... you should say right now?

432
00:27:57,764 --> 00:27:59,614
Before going to him...

433
00:27:59,614 --> 00:28:02,254
I thought about it every day.

434
00:28:02,714 --> 00:28:04,634
"Should I just kill him?

435
00:28:04,634 --> 00:28:07,944
I won't need to suffer like this, then."

436
00:28:07,944 --> 00:28:10,454
After stabbing him...

437
00:28:12,044 --> 00:28:13,754
"I should've thrust deeper."

438
00:28:13,754 --> 00:28:14,994
Kim Ga Eun...

439
00:28:14,994 --> 00:28:16,424
I'm saying I wanted to kill him.

440
00:28:16,424 --> 00:28:17,934
Kim Ga Eun, come to your senses.

441
00:28:17,934 --> 00:28:20,494
The sentence for murder is twice as much as attempted murder.

442
00:28:20,494 --> 00:28:22,364
You might end up dying in the cells.

443
00:28:22,364 --> 00:28:25,194
Do you understand what the situation is?

444
00:28:25,194 --> 00:28:27,994
Before his death, it was not easy to prove intentional murder.

445
00:28:27,994 --> 00:28:30,154
After his death, on the other hand...

446
00:28:30,154 --> 00:28:34,334
it's hard to prove the crime to be accidental!

447
00:28:41,604 --> 00:28:43,854
I'm not even asking you to pray for Kim Eui Cheol.

448
00:28:43,854 --> 00:28:48,034
However, a person died. In this case...

449
00:28:50,164 --> 00:28:53,404
you shouldn't be like this, should you?

450
00:28:57,854 --> 00:29:00,324
She's totally a psychopath.

451
00:29:00,324 --> 00:29:02,724
He was still her child's father, so how could she be so indifferent?

452
00:29:02,724 --> 00:29:04,534
Does it make sense that she wanted to kill him?

453
00:29:04,534 --> 00:29:08,124
She wouldn't have stabbed someone if she was mundane.

454
00:29:10,434 --> 00:29:14,304
Things are getting more bloody now, so... does it interest you?

455
00:29:14,304 --> 00:29:16,984
Do you want to take the case now, CEO Seo?

456
00:29:17,934 --> 00:29:20,234
I don't really like that judge.

457
00:29:20,234 --> 00:29:23,084
She looks like my ex-wife's friend.

458
00:29:23,084 --> 00:29:25,964
What a petty reason you give.

459
00:29:25,964 --> 00:29:29,494
Your wife is the one who abandoned you, so why hate the judge?

460
00:29:29,494 --> 00:29:31,114
Even if she looks like her friend.

461
00:29:31,114 --> 00:29:35,164
Hey, she didn't abandon me. We graduated from marriage under the agreement.

462
00:29:35,164 --> 00:29:37,414
- Yeah, yeah. 
 - Huh? Hey!

463
00:29:37,414 --> 00:29:39,934
Why are you dumping your case on me?

464
00:29:39,934 --> 00:29:42,154
You little...

465
00:29:42,154 --> 00:29:46,804
Well... you're not taking it anyway. Also, I'm not dumping it.

466
00:29:46,804 --> 00:29:48,574
I really can't do this.

467
00:29:48,574 --> 00:29:50,874
How do I defend someone who says she wanted to kill?

468
00:29:50,874 --> 00:29:53,254
Don't do it if you don't want to!

469
00:29:53,254 --> 00:29:56,194
You can still sign to resign as her attorney.

470
00:29:57,814 --> 00:30:01,744
If I quit, CEO Hong is sure to tell me off.

471
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:06,004
"Even if you don't like the person...

472
00:30:06,004 --> 00:30:08,714
she still has a right to be defended."

473
00:30:13,324 --> 00:30:15,504
It's a criminal case.

474
00:30:15,504 --> 00:30:17,954
I can't force it on you.

475
00:30:17,954 --> 00:30:21,394
As you said, if she really doesn't show any sign of remorse,

476
00:30:21,394 --> 00:30:24,334
you might end up living in guilt for the rest of your life.

477
00:30:24,334 --> 00:30:27,354
Wondering if you had helped a criminal let loose.

478
00:30:27,354 --> 00:30:32,034
Well... I can't be responsible for that much.

479
00:30:32,884 --> 00:30:36,324
If you want to resign, you can think about it.

480
00:30:38,454 --> 00:30:40,014
Come in.

481
00:30:41,374 --> 00:30:44,004
Attorney Goo, Student Kim Young Bi is here.

482
00:30:44,004 --> 00:30:45,364
Oh, okay.

483
00:30:45,364 --> 00:30:46,434
- Who is it? 
 - Her daughter.

484
00:30:46,434 --> 00:30:47,524
- What? 
 - The daughter.

485
00:30:47,524 --> 00:30:50,434
Daughter?

486
00:30:50,434 --> 00:30:52,354
She had a daughter?

487
00:30:53,154 --> 00:30:55,724
- Attorney Goo is here. 
 - Okay.

488
00:30:55,724 --> 00:30:57,884
You're Kim Young Bi?

489
00:30:57,884 --> 00:30:59,074
Hello.

490
00:30:59,074 --> 00:31:00,734
Nice to meet you.

491
00:31:06,124 --> 00:31:07,414
Who is it?

492
00:31:07,414 --> 00:31:08,774
She's the daughter.

493
00:31:08,774 --> 00:31:10,474
Sorry?

494
00:31:13,944 --> 00:31:16,564
She's Kim Ga Eun's daughter.

495
00:31:18,204 --> 00:31:22,864
You want to... be your mom's sentencing witness?

496
00:31:22,864 --> 00:31:26,604
Yes. I searched the internet and read that

497
00:31:26,604 --> 00:31:29,344
these things can be grounds for lighter sentencing.

498
00:31:29,344 --> 00:31:33,384
Could it be that... even such witnesses won't help in Mom's case?

499
00:31:33,384 --> 00:31:35,494
No, not at all.

500
00:31:35,494 --> 00:31:40,494
Well... I'm worried because you're a minor.

501
00:31:40,494 --> 00:31:42,164
Minors can't do it?

502
00:31:42,164 --> 00:31:44,524
It's not like that, but...

503
00:31:46,254 --> 00:31:50,364
your heart may be... hurt because of the issue...

504
00:31:51,204 --> 00:31:53,674
of your mom and dad.

505
00:31:57,854 --> 00:32:00,824
I'm sorry about your father.

506
00:32:00,824 --> 00:32:03,184
My mother isn't...

507
00:32:04,144 --> 00:32:07,134
someone who'd kill Father.

508
00:32:08,454 --> 00:32:10,774
She told me not to hate him,

509
00:32:11,524 --> 00:32:13,834
that he didn't abandon me,

510
00:32:13,834 --> 00:32:16,084
that he still

511
00:32:16,084 --> 00:32:19,824
thinks about me. She said that every day.

512
00:32:26,334 --> 00:32:28,484
That's why I came.

513
00:32:29,004 --> 00:32:30,724
 I think no one, besides me, 

514
00:32:30,724 --> 00:32:34,234
 would be on Mom's side... 

515
00:32:46,044 --> 00:32:48,274
How are things here?

516
00:32:50,164 --> 00:32:56,304
I'd rather... die than defend you.

517
00:32:56,304 --> 00:32:58,444
I was the one who wanted to take your case,

518
00:32:58,444 --> 00:33:01,564
but I feel that this is wrong.

519
00:33:01,564 --> 00:33:03,974
The person you stabbed died.

520
00:33:03,974 --> 00:33:07,284
Whether intentional or accidental.

521
00:33:07,884 --> 00:33:10,134
You came to tell me that?

522
00:33:10,134 --> 00:33:11,444
No.

523
00:33:11,444 --> 00:33:14,064
I wanted to hear the truth.

524
00:33:14,064 --> 00:33:18,724
Because you're also someone's daughter... and a mother.

525
00:33:19,734 --> 00:33:24,674
Also... this will be the last time.

526
00:33:24,674 --> 00:33:27,754
Tell me honestly what you were thinking

527
00:33:27,754 --> 00:33:31,734
and feeling when you stabbed Kim Eui Cheol, please.

528
00:33:31,734 --> 00:33:36,804
That way... I think I can make up my mind.

529
00:33:39,354 --> 00:33:41,784
Did you really want to kill him?

530
00:33:42,504 --> 00:33:45,504
So badly that you'd give up...

531
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:48,244
on your family and look away?

532
00:33:50,224 --> 00:33:52,394
I...

533
00:33:53,124 --> 00:33:55,784
Young Bi came to see me.

534
00:33:55,784 --> 00:33:58,844
Saying her mom's not that kind of a person...

535
00:33:59,334 --> 00:34:03,734
That her mother told her not to hate her father.

536
00:34:04,364 --> 00:34:06,734
But why did you stab him?

537
00:34:17,574 --> 00:34:19,584
That's not it.

538
00:34:20,934 --> 00:34:24,294
I didn't plan on doing that at first.

539
00:34:24,944 --> 00:34:29,664
Because that man... kept saying...

540
00:34:30,524 --> 00:34:33,364
he won't let Young Bi be...

541
00:34:33,364 --> 00:34:35,014
I got angry.

542
00:34:35,014 --> 00:34:37,604
I wanted to show him.

543
00:34:37,604 --> 00:34:42,724
I had to show him how I'll protect my own child.

544
00:34:43,204 --> 00:34:46,714
I really... didn't plan to do that.

545
00:34:46,714 --> 00:34:48,924
It's the truth, Attorney Goo.

546
00:34:48,924 --> 00:34:51,854
I didn't plan on killing him.

547
00:35:03,304 --> 00:35:06,214
Why are you telling me this now?

548
00:35:08,224 --> 00:35:10,904
Had you been honest from the start...

549
00:35:10,904 --> 00:35:12,944
Young Bi will...

550
00:35:14,404 --> 00:35:17,114
find out then.

551
00:35:18,224 --> 00:35:22,394
About what threats her dad made.

552
00:35:22,394 --> 00:35:25,154
I couldn't let her know that.

553
00:35:25,714 --> 00:35:29,544
That's the only thing. I really didn't want to kill him.

554
00:36:16,054 --> 00:36:17,934
Knock, knock.

555
00:36:23,634 --> 00:36:29,774
I heard... you're defending Kim Ga Eun because of her daughter?

556
00:36:29,784 --> 00:36:31,714
Everyone at the office knows already.

557
00:36:31,714 --> 00:36:35,634
Well... it is what it is.

558
00:36:35,634 --> 00:36:37,514
She's really something else.

559
00:36:37,514 --> 00:36:41,084
She looked these things up on the internet and came?

560
00:36:41,084 --> 00:36:43,444
She's a really smart kid.

561
00:36:43,444 --> 00:36:44,600
How old is she?

562
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:46,630
15 years old.

563
00:36:48,444 --> 00:36:53,934
She's probably at the height of her adolescent years... but she matured too much.

564
00:36:57,394 --> 00:37:01,774
Would that Oh Ro Ra girl also be as mature?

565
00:37:06,974 --> 00:37:12,054
What... happened to your parents' divorce?

566
00:37:12,054 --> 00:37:15,224
Mom's saying one thing today and another tomorrow.

567
00:37:15,224 --> 00:37:18,264
Her mind paces every day.

568
00:37:18,854 --> 00:37:21,564
Would divorce be easy?

569
00:37:21,564 --> 00:37:23,744
It's only easy to say.

570
00:37:29,224 --> 00:37:33,794
I guess my mom... doesn't find divorce easy, either.

571
00:37:33,794 --> 00:37:36,204
I mean, what's so hard about it?

572
00:37:37,494 --> 00:37:41,194
How can she live with him when her back must be bleeding?

573
00:37:41,194 --> 00:37:43,714
I mean, that's true, but...

574
00:37:43,714 --> 00:37:48,754
I guess Mom finds it hard to make up her mind since Dad keeps clinging to her.

575
00:37:48,754 --> 00:37:53,324
I told you. He even knelt in front of me.

576
00:37:53,324 --> 00:37:55,174
Is kneeling down such a hard thing?

577
00:37:55,174 --> 00:37:59,334
The media makes it look like such a grand gesture,

578
00:37:59,334 --> 00:38:01,614
but it's not really that hard.

579
00:38:01,614 --> 00:38:05,024
A person will go even lower should there be a need for it.

580
00:38:05,024 --> 00:38:07,534
You know, the thing with crocodile tears and all.

581
00:38:08,384 --> 00:38:11,414
Why don't you convince your mom and come out of that house?

582
00:38:11,414 --> 00:38:13,914
She can live at your house.

583
00:38:13,914 --> 00:38:16,054
Mom doesn't want to.

584
00:38:19,144 --> 00:38:22,024
Let's stop. There's no answer to this anyway.

585
00:38:22,024 --> 00:38:25,384
Okay, well, it's your family's matter anyway.

586
00:38:34,504 --> 00:38:38,234
Are you... displeased?

587
00:38:38,234 --> 00:38:40,634
That my mom and dad aren't getting a divorce?

588
00:38:40,634 --> 00:38:43,834
What do you mean?

589
00:38:43,834 --> 00:38:46,904
I mean... I'm telling you honestly how I feel.

590
00:38:46,904 --> 00:38:49,364
How complicated I feel...

591
00:38:49,364 --> 00:38:51,534
but why do I feel like you're interrogating me?

592
00:38:51,534 --> 00:38:55,084
Me? Interrogating you?

593
00:38:55,084 --> 00:38:58,504
Never mind. Let's quit it.

594
00:39:05,184 --> 00:39:09,904
Is he saying my mom needs to divorce three times because his mom did?

595
00:39:09,904 --> 00:39:12,924
He keeps treating my mom like a fool for not divorcing.

596
00:39:12,924 --> 00:39:14,964
I'm sure he didn't treat her like a fool.

597
00:39:14,964 --> 00:39:17,074
He probably was just stating his opinion.

598
00:39:17,074 --> 00:39:18,904
No, he wasn'tâ€”

599
00:39:18,904 --> 00:39:20,734
You can tell just by looking at his face.

600
00:39:20,734 --> 00:39:21,954
It was written on his face.

601
00:39:21,954 --> 00:39:25,474
"Whoa, this family is hopeless."

602
00:39:27,664 --> 00:39:30,004
Hey...

603
00:39:30,004 --> 00:39:31,984
Just 10 minutes, please!

604
00:39:31,984 --> 00:39:34,984
Listen to me for just five minutes!

605
00:39:34,984 --> 00:39:38,474
Gosh, my chest is about to explode from frustration!

606
00:39:38,474 --> 00:39:40,854
Hey, I need to draft the written statement by today.

607
00:39:40,854 --> 00:39:42,844
The trial is only two days away.

608
00:39:42,844 --> 00:39:46,094
I'm listening, so just go ahead.

609
00:39:46,794 --> 00:39:49,884
Hey, Jae Gyeom is calling me.

610
00:39:49,884 --> 00:39:51,334
Answer it. Answer the call.

611
00:39:51,334 --> 00:39:53,434
Why is he calling me now?

612
00:39:53,434 --> 00:39:55,174
On speaker.

613
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:58,604
   

614
00:39:58,604 --> 00:40:00,994
- Yes, Jae Gyeom. 
 -  Where are you, Hyung? 

615
00:40:00,994 --> 00:40:03,804
 I'm so frustrated. Can you buy me a drink? 

616
00:40:03,804 --> 00:40:05,204
Drink?

617
00:40:05,204 --> 00:40:08,454
I'm a little busy right now, so I'm at the office.

618
00:40:08,454 --> 00:40:10,024
I'm not done with work yet.

619
00:40:10,024 --> 00:40:13,624
Oh, really? I'm nearby, so I'll go to your office.

620
00:40:13,624 --> 00:40:15,144
 You don't need to buy me a drink. 

621
00:40:15,144 --> 00:40:18,554
 Please just hear me out for 30 minutes. 

622
00:40:21,534 --> 00:40:22,994
I don't think I can.

623
00:40:22,994 --> 00:40:25,254
When do you finish, then?

624
00:40:25,254 --> 00:40:28,224
Well, one second, please...

625
00:40:30,364 --> 00:40:31,644
I think I'll be here all night.

626
00:40:31,644 --> 00:40:33,414
 It's because I'm really upset. 

627
00:40:33,414 --> 00:40:35,944
I won't take too much of your time, okay?

628
00:40:37,454 --> 00:40:41,634
Or are you with someone right now?

629
00:40:41,634 --> 00:40:44,104
No, I'm all alone.

630
00:40:44,104 --> 00:40:47,314
I'll be there soon, so please lend me a few minutes.

631
00:40:47,314 --> 00:40:48,494
I'll be there soon!

632
00:40:48,494 --> 00:40:50,394
   

633
00:40:50,934 --> 00:40:55,934
Hey... So why would you lie and say you're sleeping at home?

634
00:40:55,934 --> 00:40:58,844
Should I tell him I came to snitch on him to you, then?

635
00:40:58,844 --> 00:41:00,724
Whatever. I'm going.

636
00:41:00,724 --> 00:41:02,754
I'll be off.

637
00:41:25,824 --> 00:41:27,724
Ha Ra...

638
00:41:33,194 --> 00:41:34,344
Jae Gyeom...

639
00:41:34,344 --> 00:41:36,384
What are you doing here?

640
00:41:36,384 --> 00:41:38,014
Well...

641
00:41:38,764 --> 00:41:42,394
- I forgot something here, so... 
 - Forget it.

642
00:41:43,394 --> 00:41:45,884
Let's talk for a minute.

643
00:42:07,884 --> 00:42:12,214
Why don't you quit working there... and move to another office?

644
00:42:15,114 --> 00:42:16,984
Why? You don't want to?

645
00:42:16,984 --> 00:42:21,194
- Jae Gyeom, nothing happened betweenâ€” 
 - I know.

646
00:42:22,554 --> 00:42:25,444
But things could happen in the future, causing me to misunderstand.

647
00:42:25,444 --> 00:42:27,304
It would never.

648
00:42:27,304 --> 00:42:29,194
Never...

649
00:42:30,384 --> 00:42:33,124
How can you guarantee that?

650
00:42:33,124 --> 00:42:34,634
He...

651
00:42:34,634 --> 00:42:38,194
- He really has no feelingsâ€” 
 - But you do.

652
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:43,600
Those feelings... When will you finally be over them?

653
00:42:48,394 --> 00:42:51,694
- I'm over them nowâ€” 
 - You're lying again.

654
00:42:51,694 --> 00:42:54,464
Why do you keep lying to me?

655
00:42:58,714 --> 00:43:00,574
Forget it.

656
00:43:02,454 --> 00:43:04,634
Let's just call it quits.

657
00:43:08,154 --> 00:43:11,704
Call it quits on what?

658
00:43:12,944 --> 00:43:16,644
I don't think I can keep it going with a dishonest person.

659
00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:22,104
Let's break up.

660
00:43:37,184 --> 00:43:39,724
 Although I let him know I broke up with Min Jae Gyeom, 

661
00:43:39,724 --> 00:43:42,154
 my accomplice didn't reply. 

662
00:43:43,134 --> 00:43:47,734
 If I called him without saying anything, I'd be doing a bad thing. 

663
00:43:54,134 --> 00:43:57,864
- I like you a lot, Hyung! 
 - You're so heavy.

664
00:43:57,864 --> 00:44:00,424
Hey, get in the car.

665
00:44:02,434 --> 00:44:05,084
Yes. Okay, okay. I'm going.

666
00:44:05,084 --> 00:44:07,054
I'm going.

667
00:44:07,054 --> 00:44:09,184
Wait, your seat belt.

668
00:44:10,294 --> 00:44:14,184
Sir, please make sure to park and everything perfectly.

669
00:44:14,184 --> 00:44:15,504
Okay, I got it.

670
00:44:15,504 --> 00:44:17,604
- Take care. 
 - I'm going.

671
00:44:17,604 --> 00:44:19,854
Bye, Hyung.

672
00:44:34,444 --> 00:44:38,054
 I ended things with Jae Gyeom. 

673
00:44:51,634 --> 00:44:55,504
   

674
00:44:58,254 --> 00:45:03,134
â™«  I finally had realized  â™«

675
00:45:04,634 --> 00:45:09,584
â™«  Among my hidden pains  â™«

676
00:45:09,584 --> 00:45:16,334
â™«  another me was in there  â™« 
    

677
00:45:16,334 --> 00:45:28,644
â™«  The times when we had been together, gives me strength  â™«

678
00:45:28,644 --> 00:45:31,374
 I'll go to your house right now. 

679
00:45:31,374 --> 00:45:35,684
â™«  All of the memories of loving you  â™«

680
00:45:35,684 --> 00:45:39,624
   

681
00:45:39,624 --> 00:45:43,434
â™«  At the same place  â™«

682
00:45:43,434 --> 00:45:48,544
â™«  Able to smile brightly  â™«

683
00:45:48,544 --> 00:45:57,924
â™«  My way, I walk on my way  â™«

684
00:46:09,304 --> 00:46:14,504
â™«  All of the happy memories  â™«

685
00:46:14,504 --> 00:46:19,954
â™«  My way, at the same  â™«

686
00:46:19,954 --> 00:46:21,614
   
 No. 

687
00:46:21,614 --> 00:46:23,824
 Let's end things here. 

688
00:46:24,754 --> 00:46:27,574
 I feel really bad. 

689
00:46:27,574 --> 00:46:29,504
 I mean it. 

690
00:46:29,504 --> 00:46:37,664
â™«  I walk on my way  â™«

691
00:46:58,954 --> 00:47:01,394
How many wounds did Kim Eui Cheol's body have?

692
00:47:01,394 --> 00:47:03,214
There was one.

693
00:47:03,214 --> 00:47:07,424
Looking at the location and depth of the wound, please tell us your

694
00:47:07,424 --> 00:47:09,244
expert opinion on his chances of death.

695
00:47:09,244 --> 00:47:13,484
I can't say for sure, but you can say his chances of death would be slim.

696
00:47:13,484 --> 00:47:17,634
What could have been Kim Eui Cheol's cause of death, then?

697
00:47:17,634 --> 00:47:19,490
I wrote it in my opinion letter,

698
00:47:19,490 --> 00:47:22,790
but he had a chronic abdominal aortic aneurysm.

699
00:47:22,794 --> 00:47:25,444
With the size of his aneurysm,

700
00:47:25,444 --> 00:47:27,824
he has to be careful about elevated blood pressure.

701
00:47:27,824 --> 00:47:32,924
It looks like his blood pressure rose when he was stabbed, and his aortic aneurysm ruptured.

702
00:47:32,924 --> 00:47:35,364
Summarizing what you told us,

703
00:47:35,364 --> 00:47:39,944
his death is totally unrelated to the injury caused by Defendant Kim Ga Eun.

704
00:47:39,944 --> 00:47:41,964
    
 Objection, Your Honor.

705
00:47:41,964 --> 00:47:46,324
Can't you say his aortic aneurysm was ruptured because he was stabbed?

706
00:47:46,324 --> 00:47:48,704
If he didn't cheat on his wife,

707
00:47:48,704 --> 00:47:51,694
he wouldn't have been stabbed.

708
00:47:51,694 --> 00:47:55,224
It's an elicitation aiming to claim directly

709
00:47:55,224 --> 00:47:58,944
how the injury and the cause of death are unrelated.

710
00:48:00,894 --> 00:48:04,444
Withdraw the last question and the witness' statement.

711
00:48:04,444 --> 00:48:08,434
Defendant Representative, please ask your question again.

712
00:48:09,454 --> 00:48:11,244
Okay, I'll ask her again.

713
00:48:11,244 --> 00:48:15,434
Could the victim's wound, without taking the aortic aneurysm into account,

714
00:48:15,434 --> 00:48:18,684
be a critical wound, in a doctor's opinion?

715
00:48:18,684 --> 00:48:21,064
Given that there are no chronic illnesses,

716
00:48:21,064 --> 00:48:24,884
I don't think it was critical enough to cause death.

717
00:48:34,644 --> 00:48:36,444
That's all.

718
00:48:43,384 --> 00:48:45,394
Since this case doesn't...

719
00:48:45,394 --> 00:48:48,514
concern a couple whose married status has been established,

720
00:48:48,514 --> 00:48:50,824
it's hard to make the usual comparisons. However...

721
00:48:50,824 --> 00:48:54,024
I heard scenes of murders between family members have a distinct

722
00:48:54,024 --> 00:48:56,534
difference from those of regular murders?

723
00:48:56,534 --> 00:48:58,574
- Yes. 
 - What's the difference?

724
00:48:58,574 --> 00:49:03,024
Generally, when a spouse stabs the other spouse in the spur of a fight,

725
00:49:03,024 --> 00:49:04,754
most of them turn themselves in.

726
00:49:04,754 --> 00:49:06,334
Oh, is that so?

727
00:49:06,334 --> 00:49:09,634
Does that mean it's rare to see one run away?

728
00:49:09,634 --> 00:49:11,164
It almost never happens.

729
00:49:11,164 --> 00:49:15,544
It's actually more common for the stabber to call the police or the ambulance out of shock.

730
00:49:15,544 --> 00:49:18,354
Oh, is that so?

731
00:49:18,354 --> 00:49:23,204
In that case... why would Kim Ga Eun have chosen to run away?

732
00:49:23,204 --> 00:49:25,114
Normally, there are two reasons.

733
00:49:25,114 --> 00:49:26,444
Objection, Your Honor.

734
00:49:26,444 --> 00:49:30,194
It isn't right to ask the detective why the suspect ran away and not the person.

735
00:49:30,194 --> 00:49:33,744
I'm asking only about a veteran detective's statistical knowledge.

736
00:49:33,744 --> 00:49:35,954
Please allow it.

737
00:49:38,274 --> 00:49:40,414
Let us listen first.

738
00:49:43,744 --> 00:49:45,644
Okay, please go on.

739
00:49:45,644 --> 00:49:49,534
The first reason is when this isn't a first offense...

740
00:49:49,534 --> 00:49:52,324
meaning they can't be caught since they're on probation.

741
00:49:52,324 --> 00:49:54,434
The other reason is when...

742
00:49:55,254 --> 00:49:57,404
they didn't intend to stab only once.

743
00:49:57,404 --> 00:50:00,274
The crime hasn't been completed yet?

744
00:50:00,274 --> 00:50:02,414
Objection, Your Honor. He's leading the witness.

745
00:50:02,414 --> 00:50:05,154
Please withdraw his statement.

746
00:50:05,154 --> 00:50:07,464
Withdrawal accepted.

747
00:50:08,714 --> 00:50:10,234
Okay, we understand, Detective.

748
00:50:10,234 --> 00:50:14,064
Thank you for your helpful testimony.

749
00:50:14,064 --> 00:50:15,784
That's all.

750
00:50:36,084 --> 00:50:42,814
Thank you. Also... I'm sorry.

751
00:50:42,814 --> 00:50:44,734
What are you sorry for?

752
00:50:44,734 --> 00:50:48,734
For saying I can't be a witness when I said I would.

753
00:50:49,854 --> 00:50:52,024
Don't even mention it.

754
00:50:53,444 --> 00:50:54,724
It's scary.

755
00:50:54,724 --> 00:50:56,454
It's okay.

756
00:50:57,994 --> 00:51:01,594
It's rightfully too hard for a kid like you to handle.

757
00:51:02,754 --> 00:51:04,974
I understand how you feel.

758
00:51:06,864 --> 00:51:11,214
In your place, I will do my best, including your share of the load.

759
00:51:11,214 --> 00:51:13,714
You just focus on studying hard.

760
00:51:13,714 --> 00:51:18,414
Try not to... come to the trial if you can.

761
00:51:19,954 --> 00:51:22,644
What if Mom feels sad about it?

762
00:51:22,644 --> 00:51:24,814
Your mom has her own life.

763
00:51:26,254 --> 00:51:28,514
Your life has to be different.

764
00:51:30,814 --> 00:51:32,494
Okay.

765
00:51:32,494 --> 00:51:35,164
Go. Go and help yourself to some pizza.

766
00:51:35,164 --> 00:51:39,070
- Thank you. Please take care. 
 - Okay.

767
00:51:58,934 --> 00:52:02,534
   

768
00:52:14,804 --> 00:52:16,954
   

769
00:52:21,424 --> 00:52:23,524
Where do I need to stamp?

770
00:52:24,784 --> 00:52:28,384
Here and here. Next to your name.

771
00:52:40,514 --> 00:52:42,384
   

772
00:52:48,664 --> 00:52:51,184
   

773
00:53:02,084 --> 00:53:04,014
Wait!

774
00:53:11,094 --> 00:53:14,024
The alimony definitely isn't enough.

775
00:53:14,024 --> 00:53:15,884
Give her 10 million won more.

776
00:53:20,434 --> 00:53:22,394
This little brat, seriously...

777
00:53:22,394 --> 00:53:24,054
When I finally made my decision...

778
00:53:24,054 --> 00:53:26,204
When I finally made my decision!

779
00:53:26,204 --> 00:53:27,944
I'm not stamping! I can't do it.

780
00:53:27,944 --> 00:53:30,534
I can't and I won't.

781
00:53:30,534 --> 00:53:32,794
I'm not doing it!

782
00:53:56,234 --> 00:53:57,304
   

783
00:53:57,304 --> 00:53:58,654
Hello, Sis.

784
00:53:58,654 --> 00:54:00,974
 Hey, you're coming later. Right? 

785
00:54:02,124 --> 00:54:03,434
Yes.

786
00:54:03,434 --> 00:54:07,284
 Buy a bottle of wine on the way, then. A white wine that Mom likes. 

787
00:54:07,284 --> 00:54:09,884
I'll be showered with that wine, won't I?

788
00:54:10,884 --> 00:54:12,464
 Possibly. 

789
00:54:12,464 --> 00:54:13,904
 I'm kidding. 

790
00:54:13,904 --> 00:54:16,314
 Use this chance to get on Mom's good side. 

791
00:54:16,314 --> 00:54:18,854
 Choose a delicious one, all right? 

792
00:54:18,854 --> 00:54:20,784
A delicious one?

793
00:54:20,784 --> 00:54:23,024
Any expensive one will do just fine.

794
00:54:23,024 --> 00:54:25,884
-  Probably.  
 - Okay.

795
00:54:32,704 --> 00:54:34,174
Mom.

796
00:54:35,844 --> 00:54:40,064
Can you really not divorce Dad and forgive him?

797
00:54:48,934 --> 00:54:52,274
What about that woman and her kid?

798
00:54:52,274 --> 00:54:54,314
What do you mean?

799
00:55:03,464 --> 00:55:05,734
N-No...

800
00:55:05,734 --> 00:55:10,834
I-I was curious about what was taking so long.

801
00:55:10,834 --> 00:55:15,494
You're going to acknowledge that Ro Ra girl as your daughter, aren't you?

802
00:55:15,494 --> 00:55:18,844
You can't help but accept it because it's her legal right.

803
00:55:18,844 --> 00:55:21,794
Since she's your biological offspring.

804
00:55:21,794 --> 00:55:25,634
Whenever she files for acknowledgment, you'll lose, no matter what.

805
00:55:25,634 --> 00:55:28,514
He needs to do it even if he doesn't want to.

806
00:55:28,514 --> 00:55:30,524
He needs to register her as family.

807
00:55:30,524 --> 00:55:33,974
I-I... told her I'll pay her child support,

808
00:55:33,974 --> 00:55:36,644
but never to file for acknowledgment.

809
00:55:36,644 --> 00:55:41,284
- She also agreed not toâ€” 
 - I know you kept convincing Mom with that nonsense.

810
00:55:41,284 --> 00:55:45,644
Let me tell you one more time, Mom. This is nonsense.

811
00:55:51,794 --> 00:55:54,474
You can't move on being mentally triumphant

812
00:55:54,474 --> 00:55:57,274
as if nothing ever happened.

813
00:56:02,684 --> 00:56:07,154
This person... isn't the person you loved.

814
00:56:08,484 --> 00:56:10,914
There's a difference now.

815
00:56:10,914 --> 00:56:14,124
I'm asking if you can accept

816
00:56:14,124 --> 00:56:17,444
even his child from an affair and forgive him.

817
00:56:25,784 --> 00:56:27,754
If you can't, you should stamp it todayâ€”

818
00:56:27,754 --> 00:56:29,814
Okay, I understand.

819
00:56:35,434 --> 00:56:37,354
I understand.

820
00:56:37,354 --> 00:56:39,364
I won't complain about that.

821
00:56:39,364 --> 00:56:40,994
That's it, right?

822
00:56:44,174 --> 00:56:46,754
H-Honey...

823
00:56:51,084 --> 00:56:55,354
Honey, thank you. Thank you so much.

824
00:56:55,354 --> 00:56:57,924
- Thank you so much, Honey! 
 - Get off.

825
00:57:18,444 --> 00:57:21,194
Wait... s-she's...

826
00:57:30,344 --> 00:57:32,214
Y-You...

827
00:57:32,214 --> 00:57:34,864
I had a fight with Mom and left home.

828
00:57:34,864 --> 00:57:37,294
Please raise me, Dad.

829
00:57:41,124 --> 00:57:44,044
Ro Ra, let's talk outside. Okay?

830
00:57:44,044 --> 00:57:45,794
Come on. Come outside with Dad andâ€”

831
00:57:45,794 --> 00:57:47,554
Dad.

832
00:57:53,064 --> 00:57:55,244
Go and tend to Mom.

833
00:57:58,614 --> 00:58:00,864
You come and talk with me.

834
00:58:07,694 --> 00:58:08,954
Where's your house?

835
00:58:08,954 --> 00:58:10,764
Let's talk on the way. I'll take you home.

836
00:58:10,764 --> 00:58:12,594
I'm not going home.

837
00:58:12,594 --> 00:58:15,594
- I'm going to live here. 
 - How dare you...

838
00:58:16,424 --> 00:58:18,384
choose to live at my house?

839
00:58:18,384 --> 00:58:19,794
That's absurd.

840
00:58:19,794 --> 00:58:21,674
Are you the owner of that house?

841
00:58:21,674 --> 00:58:23,474
It's my dad's house.

842
00:58:23,474 --> 00:58:25,874
Acting high and mighty with my dad's house...

843
00:58:25,874 --> 00:58:27,814
You're not the only daughter.

844
00:58:27,814 --> 00:58:29,724
I'm also Dad's daughter!

845
00:58:29,724 --> 00:58:33,154
I also have a right to live at my dad's house.

846
00:58:33,154 --> 00:58:34,424
No, you don't.

847
00:58:34,424 --> 00:58:37,284
You don't have a right.

848
00:58:37,964 --> 00:58:43,074
This isn't my dad's house, but my parents' house.

849
00:58:43,074 --> 00:58:47,344
Although Dad bought the house decades ago in his name,

850
00:58:47,344 --> 00:58:50,354
my mom's contribution as a homemaker over the last few decades

851
00:58:50,354 --> 00:58:53,124
will also be recognized after divorcing.

852
00:58:53,124 --> 00:58:56,484
You don't even know the law but dare to argue about rights.

853
00:58:56,484 --> 00:58:58,014
You're a really funny brat.

854
00:58:58,014 --> 00:59:01,014
I'm not a brat! I'm 16 years old!

855
00:59:01,014 --> 00:59:03,144
Oh, how great for you.

856
00:59:03,144 --> 00:59:05,314
16-years-old? Do you have an 8th-grade illness? 
  (Slang for teenage angst, bad attitude) 

857
00:59:05,314 --> 00:59:08,244
I'm not in 8th grade. I'm in 9th grade!

858
00:59:08,244 --> 00:59:09,734
This auntie, seriously...

859
00:59:09,734 --> 00:59:12,284
What, "auntie?" This little brat, seriously. Hey...

860
00:59:12,284 --> 00:59:15,514
Do you want to be sued for defamation by a lawyerâ€”

861
00:59:23,304 --> 00:59:25,194
Mom...

862
00:59:25,194 --> 00:59:27,214
M-Mom...

863
00:59:43,834 --> 00:59:48,834
 I can't believe the world I lived in was such a weak layer of thin ice. 

864
00:59:49,864 --> 00:59:52,594
 I was never able to realize it. 

865
00:59:53,524 --> 00:59:57,004
 More so than ever, names such as family 

866
00:59:57,004 --> 00:59:59,234
 and relationships... 

867
00:59:59,234 --> 01:00:02,084
 all feel like an illusion. 

868
01:00:02,084 --> 01:00:04,334
 In a moment like this... 

869
01:00:04,334 --> 01:00:08,154
 if someone would hold my hand and walk... 

870
01:00:08,154 --> 01:00:10,164
 how nice would it be? 

871
01:00:54,854 --> 01:00:58,784
 However, that hand will also... 

872
01:00:59,644 --> 01:01:02,444
 be a mere illusion in the end. 

873
01:01:32,104 --> 01:01:35,314
   

874
01:01:36,274 --> 01:01:37,864
Yes.

875
01:01:38,954 --> 01:01:40,214
Where are you?

876
01:01:40,214 --> 01:01:42,024
 Mom's house. 

877
01:01:42,024 --> 01:01:43,584
What now?

878
01:01:48,314 --> 01:01:49,914
Hello?

879
01:01:52,484 --> 01:01:54,304
Eun Beom...

880
01:01:57,724 --> 01:01:59,600
- What's wrong with you? 
 - Hey...

881
01:02:06,664 --> 01:02:09,124
I really want to die.

882
01:02:10,664 --> 01:02:12,274
Where are you right now?

883
01:03:10,990 --> 01:03:20,050


884
01:03:25,624 --> 01:03:27,654
â™«  I'm not okay  â™«

885
01:03:27,654 --> 01:03:29,504
 No matter how I think, Goo isn't right. 

886
01:03:29,504 --> 01:03:31,414
-  Ha Ra... 
 - Gosh, I must've gone mad. 

887
01:03:31,414 --> 01:03:35,624
 It's because Oh Ha Ra the fool likes him! 

888
01:03:36,604 --> 01:03:39,824
 Attorney Goo said you can't come in, Attorney Oh. 

889
01:03:39,824 --> 01:03:41,064
 Only me? 

890
01:03:41,064 --> 01:03:43,344
 Ha Ra, am I easy prey to you? 

891
01:03:43,344 --> 01:03:45,784
 -Don't you loath me? 
 - Of course, I do! 

892
01:03:45,784 --> 01:03:47,364
 - Good morning. 
 - I'm sure both families'... 

893
01:03:47,364 --> 01:03:51,874
 paradoxical feelings were opposing each other. 

894
01:03:51,874 --> 01:03:54,524
 I love you, Goo Eun Beom. Do you want to get back together with me? 

895
01:03:54,524 --> 01:03:58,674
