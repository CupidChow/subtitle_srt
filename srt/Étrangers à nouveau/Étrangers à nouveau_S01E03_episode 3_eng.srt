1
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:12,310
   

2
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:14,810
   

3
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:37,350
   

4
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:41,630
   

5
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:44,010
   

6
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:50,870


7
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:52,721
Ki Seo Hee...

8
00:00:57,001 --> 00:01:00,501
 I think it's that woman. 

9
00:01:01,401 --> 00:01:04,601
 - Who? 
 - Ki Seo Hee. 

10
00:01:04,601 --> 00:01:07,990
 - You didn't see her? 
 - I didn't. 

11
00:01:14,001 --> 00:01:17,961
- I need to use the restroom. 
 - Okay.

12
00:01:24,691 --> 00:01:26,861
Hello.

13
00:01:28,911 --> 00:01:30,711
Ha Ra...

14
00:01:30,711 --> 00:01:31,981
What brings you here?

15
00:01:31,981 --> 00:01:34,301
What do you mean? Am I not allowed to come here?

16
00:01:34,301 --> 00:01:37,461
No, I mean... Who did you come with?

17
00:01:37,461 --> 00:01:39,751
Did you come with Jae Gyeom? Is it a date?

18
00:01:39,751 --> 00:01:42,101
Yes, we are on a date since it's the weekend.

19
00:01:42,101 --> 00:01:44,761
Oh, I see.

20
00:01:44,761 --> 00:01:48,551
Are you two also on a date?

21
00:01:48,551 --> 00:01:50,301
No.

22
00:01:51,911 --> 00:01:54,681
You have a peculiar taste, Ki Seo Hee.

23
00:01:54,681 --> 00:01:57,921
- Ha Ra... 
 - I thought you didn't prefer used goods.

24
00:01:57,921 --> 00:02:02,101
But I guess he's still decent to some degree, right?

25
00:02:03,911 --> 00:02:06,181
Do you have an interest in my taste?

26
00:02:06,181 --> 00:02:09,471
Oh, also, it's not your business whether

27
00:02:09,471 --> 00:02:13,341
he's used or new since you're divorced, Oh Ha Ra.

28
00:02:19,621 --> 00:02:25,411
   

29
00:02:25,411 --> 00:02:29,221
She looks so innocent, but...

30
00:02:29,221 --> 00:02:32,141
she was completely reckless.

31
00:02:37,161 --> 00:02:42,461
I guess that's why she'd take someone else's husband.

32
00:02:46,511 --> 00:02:50,421
How can you sleep when I'm fuming with anger?

33
00:02:52,151 --> 00:02:57,051
Why are you fussing at my place when the adulterer pissed you off?

34
00:02:57,051 --> 00:02:59,491
Did I take him from you?

35
00:02:59,491 --> 00:03:02,001
Did I take him?

36
00:03:05,551 --> 00:03:08,661
I mean they wouldn't get married, would they?

37
00:03:08,661 --> 00:03:12,031
Goo is broke with not a single asset, and she has a kid.

38
00:03:12,031 --> 00:03:14,661
It's not a matter of whether they have a wedding or not.

39
00:03:14,661 --> 00:03:17,671
It's how I feel. I feel like shit, you know?

40
00:03:17,671 --> 00:03:22,551
How can those two dare to team up again in front of me?

41
00:03:22,551 --> 00:03:25,641
They should at least meet without getting caught.

42
00:03:26,491 --> 00:03:30,801
Technically speaking, they didn't do it in front of you on purpose.

43
00:03:30,801 --> 00:03:34,161
It just happened that your paths crossed at the hottest bar in Gangnam.

44
00:03:34,161 --> 00:03:37,381
He joined our firm.

45
00:03:37,381 --> 00:03:41,371
If I see him again on Monday, I'll want to murder him.

46
00:03:41,371 --> 00:03:44,541
He has no consideration for me at all.

47
00:03:45,541 --> 00:03:48,251
Why would he make passes at me if he was going to do that?

48
00:03:48,251 --> 00:03:51,641
Why did he f***ing record the conversation as if he wanted to help me?

49
00:03:51,641 --> 00:03:53,371
Did I ask for his help?

50
00:03:53,371 --> 00:03:55,391
Record?

51
00:03:55,391 --> 00:03:58,301
Did he come on to you?

52
00:03:58,301 --> 00:04:01,021
It's nothing.

53
00:04:02,631 --> 00:04:05,311
I don't even want to think about this.

54
00:04:05,911 --> 00:04:08,911
He's as shallow as thin tracing paper.

55
00:04:08,911 --> 00:04:12,781
He's seriously an expert on playing a person.

56
00:04:12,781 --> 00:04:15,601
Life is just a joke to him.

57
00:04:15,601 --> 00:04:19,801
Let's just kill him.

58
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:23,331
They said you don't have to be patient three times if you murder once. 
  (Misquoting Korean proverb) 

59
00:04:23,331 --> 00:04:24,941
Don't think about this for too long.

60
00:04:24,941 --> 00:04:27,351
Let's just kill him.

61
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:29,911
Right?

62
00:04:29,911 --> 00:04:32,091
That's better, isn't it?

63
00:04:44,331 --> 00:04:45,541
Hello.

64
00:04:45,541 --> 00:04:47,721
 Hello. 

65
00:05:03,911 --> 00:05:05,401
You're here?

66
00:05:05,401 --> 00:05:06,991
Yes.

67
00:05:08,921 --> 00:05:11,541
What are you doing here?

68
00:05:11,541 --> 00:05:13,781
I'm working.

69
00:05:13,781 --> 00:05:15,811
That, I can tell.

70
00:05:16,521 --> 00:05:21,081
Since this is my office, so why would you work here?

71
00:05:21,081 --> 00:05:25,671
When did you two start seeing each other again?

72
00:05:25,671 --> 00:05:27,541
"You two?"

73
00:05:27,541 --> 00:05:29,121
Who are you talking about?

74
00:05:29,121 --> 00:05:31,411
Don't play with me here.

75
00:05:31,411 --> 00:05:33,741
You know who I'm talking about.

76
00:05:34,761 --> 00:05:35,891
It's a misunderstanding.

77
00:05:35,891 --> 00:05:37,281
I swear.

78
00:05:37,281 --> 00:05:41,041
I met her for work because she needed help with something.

79
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:45,691
She's preparing a lawsuit for change of custody to bring her child from her ex-husband.

80
00:05:45,691 --> 00:05:48,541
She asked me to be her representative.

81
00:05:48,541 --> 00:05:51,951
Your words don't add up at all.

82
00:05:51,951 --> 00:05:55,751
Didn't you hear her? She said you're still usable.

83
00:05:55,751 --> 00:05:58,961
Who can you con with such lousy teamwork?

84
00:05:58,961 --> 00:06:00,641
The thing is...

85
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:02,851
The fleeting...

86
00:06:02,851 --> 00:06:09,171
usefulness she sees would be my legal knowledge, wouldn't it?

87
00:06:12,071 --> 00:06:15,771
   

88
00:06:15,771 --> 00:06:17,111
Are you sure?

89
00:06:17,111 --> 00:06:21,121
You're saying you two broke up and there's nothing between the two of you?

90
00:06:21,121 --> 00:06:22,831
Yes.

91
00:06:25,171 --> 00:06:26,481
Okay.

92
00:06:26,481 --> 00:06:29,521
I'll believe you, so give up the lawsuit you were going to help with.

93
00:06:29,521 --> 00:06:31,221
Oh, I can't do that.

94
00:06:31,221 --> 00:06:34,161
Why not? Are you the only lawyer that exists?

95
00:06:34,161 --> 00:06:38,921
I already got paid and I need to help her anyhow.

96
00:06:38,921 --> 00:06:40,721
It's because I'm indebted to her.

97
00:06:40,721 --> 00:06:44,941
You need to help her and can't leave her alone,

98
00:06:44,941 --> 00:06:49,021
but me and my feelings don't matter?

99
00:06:49,021 --> 00:06:51,681
- No, that's not it— 
 - I got it. Okay.

100
00:06:51,681 --> 00:06:53,261
What?

101
00:06:53,261 --> 00:06:54,901
What did you get?

102
00:06:54,901 --> 00:06:58,291
I won't expect you to be considerate.

103
00:06:59,311 --> 00:07:02,971
Did I forget? We're strangers.

104
00:07:02,971 --> 00:07:05,481
Do your best. I'll be rooting for you.

105
00:07:05,481 --> 00:07:08,921
I'll try my best not to make you worry—

106
00:07:08,921 --> 00:07:11,001
Anyway, I'm sorry.

107
00:07:13,231 --> 00:07:16,521
Thank you for understanding.

108
00:07:35,911 --> 00:07:40,971
   

109
00:07:42,081 --> 00:07:43,941
 In this game called life, 

110
00:07:43,941 --> 00:07:47,941
 the one who knows the rules well is bound to win. 

111
00:07:47,941 --> 00:07:52,251
This lady also lacked legal knowledge in daily life,

112
00:07:52,251 --> 00:07:55,011
which is why she faced this disaster today.

113
00:07:55,011 --> 00:07:57,621
What part of the law?

114
00:07:57,621 --> 00:08:00,951
She said she wants to sue the adulterer for damages,

115
00:08:00,951 --> 00:08:05,891
but she said it's been about four years since she found out. Right?

116
00:08:05,891 --> 00:08:08,821
However, suing an adulterer for damages

117
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:11,701
is only possible if you report

118
00:08:11,701 --> 00:08:14,631
within three years of discovery according to the law.

119
00:08:14,631 --> 00:08:16,361
Oh, I see...

120
00:08:16,361 --> 00:08:19,611
So, she can't sue her right now.

121
00:08:19,611 --> 00:08:21,711
Attorney Oh, so this means...

122
00:08:21,711 --> 00:08:26,721
Let's say three years passed and I still haven't forgiven him.

123
00:08:26,721 --> 00:08:31,501
Even so, the law forcibly just forgives them. Right?

124
00:08:31,501 --> 00:08:34,491
- What kind of a law is that? 
 - Exactly!

125
00:08:34,491 --> 00:08:36,021
This cheating spouse...

126
00:08:36,021 --> 00:08:39,330
This wretched person of a spouse... Forgiving such a person by force?

127
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:40,240
Seriously.

128
00:08:40,241 --> 00:08:42,951
If things were like this, I'd have an affair, too.

129
00:08:42,951 --> 00:08:44,381
What?

130
00:08:44,381 --> 00:08:45,411
- Why? 
 - Honey.

131
00:08:45,411 --> 00:08:46,821
- Was that wrong? 
 - Yes, that was wrong.

132
00:08:46,821 --> 00:08:48,801
- Was that not right? 
 - Say what's possible.

133
00:08:48,801 --> 00:08:52,201
- Oh, okay. 
 - I beg you.

134
00:08:52,201 --> 00:08:55,511
The law is a lot more human than we think.

135
00:08:55,511 --> 00:08:57,321
Look at the statute of limitations, for example.

136
00:08:57,321 --> 00:08:59,411
Regardless of how severe a crime you committed,

137
00:08:59,411 --> 00:09:02,321
even if you weren't legally punished, after a certain time,

138
00:09:02,321 --> 00:09:04,261
you can't be tried for the crime you committed.

139
00:09:04,261 --> 00:09:07,451
I also really find that part baffling.

140
00:09:07,451 --> 00:09:14,031
Why does the law have to be generous even to criminals?

141
00:09:14,031 --> 00:09:16,911
Well, I'm not sure.

142
00:09:17,701 --> 00:09:22,261
Wouldn't it be because there's no one who doesn't commit a sin ever in life?

143
00:09:22,261 --> 00:09:24,191
Attorney Oh.

144
00:09:24,191 --> 00:09:27,821
You're making quite a humane remark today.

145
00:09:27,821 --> 00:09:30,731
- It's a little awkward for us. 
 - Y-Yes.

146
00:09:30,731 --> 00:09:33,431
I find you quite unfamiliar.

147
00:09:35,131 --> 00:09:36,821
Actually...

148
00:09:36,821 --> 00:09:39,551
I also imagine killing someone and dreaming

149
00:09:39,551 --> 00:09:43,111
a perfect crime all the time.

150
00:09:43,111 --> 00:09:45,861
On the way to the studio today,

151
00:09:45,861 --> 00:09:49,601
I imagined burying two people together.

152
00:09:54,181 --> 00:09:57,091
I got really scared just now. I was so shocked.

153
00:09:57,091 --> 00:10:00,101
- It's not us two, is it? 
 - I hope it's not me, either.

154
00:10:00,101 --> 00:10:03,671
But I do dream about burying you all the time, Honey.

155
00:10:03,671 --> 00:10:05,731
Get rid of thoughts like that.

156
00:10:05,731 --> 00:10:07,801
That's funny.

157
00:10:08,591 --> 00:10:10,321
How can we, then...

158
00:10:10,321 --> 00:10:11,711
Attorney Oh, thank you for the work.

159
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:14,121
- Great job today. 
 - Thank you for the work.

160
00:10:14,121 --> 00:10:16,881
Could you spare me some of your time?

161
00:10:16,881 --> 00:10:19,501
Yes, sure. I can.

162
00:10:20,701 --> 00:10:23,421
Gosh, I feel great that the viewer ratings went up.

163
00:10:23,421 --> 00:10:26,901
Gosh, it's all thanks to you, Attorney Oh.

164
00:10:26,901 --> 00:10:29,371
Will you increase my appearance fee, then?

165
00:10:29,371 --> 00:10:32,631
Oh, you can't talk about that with me.

166
00:10:32,631 --> 00:10:35,921
But seriously, you speak so well, Attorney Oh.

167
00:10:35,921 --> 00:10:37,241
I think...

168
00:10:37,241 --> 00:10:40,141
I heard this while passing by last time, but

169
00:10:40,141 --> 00:10:42,751
you know Jeong Joon Kyeong, the baseball player. Right?

170
00:10:42,751 --> 00:10:43,741
Oh, yes, yes.

171
00:10:43,741 --> 00:10:48,301
He's your younger brother's wife's friend's senior, isn't he?

172
00:10:48,301 --> 00:10:50,991
- No, he isn't. 
 - He's not?

173
00:10:50,991 --> 00:10:53,501
He's not my younger brother's wife's friend's senior,

174
00:10:53,501 --> 00:10:56,651
but my younger brother's wife's senior's friend.

175
00:10:56,651 --> 00:10:58,361
Oh, I see.

176
00:10:58,361 --> 00:11:00,871
So he isn't your younger brother's wife's friend's senior,

177
00:11:00,871 --> 00:11:03,081
but your younger brother's wife's senior's friend.

178
00:11:03,081 --> 00:11:04,991
That's right.

179
00:11:06,101 --> 00:11:09,081
But why do you ask all of a sudden?

180
00:11:15,211 --> 00:11:18,811
Gosh, seriously. Do you not understand?

181
00:11:18,811 --> 00:11:20,981
So what I'm saying is...

182
00:11:20,981 --> 00:11:26,311
When we talk without any honorifics,

183
00:11:26,311 --> 00:11:30,201
regardless of each one's age and position,

184
00:11:30,201 --> 00:11:33,441
on the premise that we're all equal...

185
00:11:33,441 --> 00:11:37,521
I'm saying that's what people call horizontal speech.

186
00:11:37,521 --> 00:11:39,701
Okay? Did you understand?

187
00:11:39,701 --> 00:11:43,261
So, in short, it's the same as Yaja Time. 
  (A game where the use of honorifics is forbidden) 

188
00:11:43,261 --> 00:11:45,011
I can't do it.

189
00:11:45,011 --> 00:11:48,301
Even cold water has its upper and lower parts and

190
00:11:48,301 --> 00:11:50,121
shit water has its waves.

191
00:11:50,121 --> 00:11:55,031
Skipping honorifics to seniors in a sacred office is difficult for me.

192
00:11:55,031 --> 00:11:56,661
Hey, Kwon Si Wook...

193
00:11:56,661 --> 00:11:59,341
you were a fogey, huh?

194
00:11:59,341 --> 00:12:01,081
Does everyone use honorifics when speaking English?

195
00:12:01,081 --> 00:12:03,251
You don't.

196
00:12:03,251 --> 00:12:05,991
"Hey, James!" That's how you talk.

197
00:12:05,991 --> 00:12:07,121
Right, Lauren?

198
00:12:07,121 --> 00:12:09,281
Yes, sure. Go ahead and use it.

199
00:12:09,281 --> 00:12:11,731
Everyone, go with it for just one day. It's not much.

200
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:13,481
That's it, right? Let's have the meeting now, please.

201
00:12:13,481 --> 00:12:15,111
Why would you say it like that?

202
00:12:15,111 --> 00:12:16,331
All right, let's do that. 
  (Everyone skips honorifics from here on) 

203
00:12:16,331 --> 00:12:18,181
Sit down.

204
00:12:18,181 --> 00:12:20,361
Please, now!

205
00:12:20,361 --> 00:12:22,901
Okay. You're finally getting it now.

206
00:12:22,901 --> 00:12:24,501
All right, start!

207
00:12:24,501 --> 00:12:27,611
Attorney Kwon, what's happening with the ongoing lawsuit?

208
00:12:27,611 --> 00:12:31,221
The court accepted the request for postponement, so the trial in two days has been delayed.

209
00:12:31,221 --> 00:12:33,061
I'll get the real estate appraisal first.

210
00:12:33,061 --> 00:12:36,161
Okay. Next.

211
00:12:36,161 --> 00:12:40,431
By the way, shouldn't you focus on the meeting, Han Gil?

212
00:12:41,281 --> 00:12:43,161
Geez...

213
00:12:46,961 --> 00:12:50,371
First name calling is a bit too much, so...

214
00:12:50,371 --> 00:12:52,341
why don't you call me James?

215
00:12:52,341 --> 00:12:54,841
Or what about Attorney Seo or CEO Seo?

216
00:12:54,841 --> 00:12:57,321
What's the difference between James and Han Gil?

217
00:12:57,321 --> 00:13:02,891
Oh, is calling you by your English name okay, but Korean name offensive?

218
00:13:03,861 --> 00:13:06,611
Han Gil, you're into flunkeyism, huh?

219
00:13:09,071 --> 00:13:10,561
Han Gil was the fogey.

220
00:13:10,561 --> 00:13:12,431
You...

221
00:13:13,361 --> 00:13:14,511
It's not like that.

222
00:13:14,511 --> 00:13:17,901
Yeah, I like "Han Gil" because it sounds more affectionate than "James."

223
00:13:17,901 --> 00:13:21,301
So I'll call you that from now on. Okay?

224
00:13:22,151 --> 00:13:24,641
- Okay. 
 - You're done with the names, right?

225
00:13:24,641 --> 00:13:27,061
If you're done, let's move on.

226
00:13:27,061 --> 00:13:29,761
Attorney Oh, I heard you took a new case. What's it about?

227
00:13:29,761 --> 00:13:30,981
Well, I...

228
00:13:30,981 --> 00:13:34,261
newly took in a custody lawsuit.

229
00:13:34,261 --> 00:13:36,231
- It's so awkward. 
 - Who's the client?

230
00:13:36,231 --> 00:13:37,741
Jeong Joon Kyeong.

231
00:13:37,741 --> 00:13:39,621
I'm sure everyone knows, right?

232
00:13:39,621 --> 00:13:41,651
He's a baseball player.

233
00:13:41,651 --> 00:13:44,891
Although he's retired now.

234
00:13:48,761 --> 00:13:52,161
One of you, drop your case. Does this even make sense?

235
00:13:52,161 --> 00:13:55,981
How could the same firm represent both defendant and the plaintiff?

236
00:13:55,981 --> 00:13:58,181
I already signed the commission contract.

237
00:13:58,181 --> 00:13:59,501
Hey...

238
00:13:59,501 --> 00:14:01,201
Whoa...

239
00:14:02,701 --> 00:14:04,281
Let's just...

240
00:14:04,281 --> 00:14:05,981
have you give up, Attorney Goo.

241
00:14:05,981 --> 00:14:07,481
I can't...

242
00:14:07,481 --> 00:14:11,511
I already used up the commission after getting it in advance.

243
00:14:11,511 --> 00:14:13,871
Whoa...

244
00:14:13,871 --> 00:14:16,651
- Attorney Oh— 
 - Then...

245
00:14:17,431 --> 00:14:20,301
just let us be.

246
00:14:20,301 --> 00:14:23,681
We'll just go ahead and butt our heads.

247
00:14:23,681 --> 00:14:25,381
Wait...

248
00:14:25,381 --> 00:14:27,191
Gosh...

249
00:14:31,171 --> 00:14:33,021
Wait, Attorney Oh?

250
00:14:33,021 --> 00:14:35,631
A lawsuit isn't a joke, so why are you doing this?

251
00:14:35,631 --> 00:14:37,421
Who said it's a joke?

252
00:14:37,421 --> 00:14:39,161
I'm more serious than anyone.

253
00:14:39,161 --> 00:14:42,131
Why do you keep complicating the situation?

254
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:44,491
I said there's nothing between Seo Hee and me.

255
00:14:44,491 --> 00:14:46,811
Who was the one to complicate things first?

256
00:14:46,811 --> 00:14:50,561
I clearly told you, didn't I? I'll believe you...

257
00:14:50,561 --> 00:14:52,611
if you give up that lawsuit.

258
00:14:58,911 --> 00:15:01,081
Wait...

259
00:15:01,081 --> 00:15:03,771
I thought you understood it back then.

260
00:15:03,771 --> 00:15:06,231
You should've said you hate it and that you won't let me.

261
00:15:06,231 --> 00:15:08,191
Would I have gone with it to the end, then?

262
00:15:08,191 --> 00:15:10,711
Is it my fault that you're stupid?

263
00:15:10,711 --> 00:15:13,011
Who would think of that as being understanding?

264
00:15:13,011 --> 00:15:15,081
Unless you're an idiot.

265
00:15:17,211 --> 00:15:18,661
Okay.

266
00:15:19,451 --> 00:15:21,661
In that case...

267
00:15:21,661 --> 00:15:23,811
this idiot...

268
00:15:23,811 --> 00:15:25,901
will make one request to you.

269
00:15:26,931 --> 00:15:28,901
Let's mind our manners to each other. Okay?

270
00:15:28,901 --> 00:15:31,731
I'm saying let's not see it to the bitter ends. Since...

271
00:15:31,731 --> 00:15:34,851
it's not like we're strangers anyway.

272
00:15:34,851 --> 00:15:36,381
Hello?

273
00:15:36,381 --> 00:15:38,281
Mr. Goo Eun Beom...

274
00:15:39,551 --> 00:15:41,901
why are you acting like an amateur?

275
00:15:41,901 --> 00:15:44,271
Is this your first-day doing divorce cases?

276
00:15:44,271 --> 00:15:48,221
Don't you know a battle for custody means war?

277
00:16:06,301 --> 00:16:12,101
You're Scarlett O'Hara, who was gone with the wind?

278
00:16:13,091 --> 00:16:15,701
You're Silver Tiger, who's now...

279
00:16:15,701 --> 00:16:19,451
as broke as a dog, the symbol of karma?

280
00:16:26,371 --> 00:16:28,041
Let's settle this now.

281
00:16:28,041 --> 00:16:29,641
Fine.

282
00:17:15,791 --> 00:17:17,321
   

283
00:17:23,381 --> 00:17:25,551
   

284
00:17:26,301 --> 00:17:29,921
    
 We can't wait any longer, so let's just start.

285
00:17:29,921 --> 00:17:32,351
Your Honor, he said he's almost here...

286
00:17:32,351 --> 00:17:36,611
As you probably saw, there are a lot of people waiting outside.

287
00:17:36,611 --> 00:17:40,631
This isn't the only trial today, so let's start.

288
00:17:43,471 --> 00:17:49,301
We're only checking the facts on the submitted documents, so it's okay.

289
00:17:49,301 --> 00:17:53,091
Please proceed. I also have another schedule.

290
00:17:54,001 --> 00:17:55,011
All right.

291
00:17:55,011 --> 00:17:58,971
Plaintiff Ki Seo Hee filed a lawsuit for a change of custody

292
00:17:58,971 --> 00:18:01,860
against Defendant Jeong Joon Kyeong, correct?

293
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:03,390
   

294
00:18:08,281 --> 00:18:11,391
I apologize for coming late.

295
00:18:11,391 --> 00:18:13,651
Young attorneys nowadays...

296
00:18:13,651 --> 00:18:16,091
come late quite often.

297
00:18:17,711 --> 00:18:19,741
I am young, but

298
00:18:19,741 --> 00:18:23,501
it's really my first time coming late to a trial.

299
00:18:23,501 --> 00:18:25,841
Such a ridiculous situation...

300
00:18:25,841 --> 00:18:27,571
does happen.

301
00:18:29,301 --> 00:18:30,701
Anyhow...

302
00:18:30,701 --> 00:18:33,231
I won't ever let this happen again.

303
00:18:33,231 --> 00:18:36,271
Okay. Please prepare.

304
00:18:42,731 --> 00:18:44,601
Let me borrow a pen.

305
00:18:51,771 --> 00:18:53,221
A pen.

306
00:18:55,731 --> 00:18:58,011
The child is only seven years old, so

307
00:18:58,011 --> 00:19:02,061
she'll be very confused if she needs to live in the U.S. all of a sudden.

308
00:19:02,061 --> 00:19:07,201
Wouldn't it be more emotionally stable for the child to live with her mother in Korea?

309
00:19:07,201 --> 00:19:11,321
She's a mother who left behind her family and child

310
00:19:11,321 --> 00:19:14,811
when the child was only five years old.

311
00:19:14,811 --> 00:19:19,091
But to ask for the child now because you're worried,

312
00:19:19,091 --> 00:19:22,851
aren't you concerned about your own irresponsibility, plaintiff?

313
00:19:23,481 --> 00:19:26,791
The defendant is the reason why the plaintiff left home.

314
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:30,661
It's all written in detail, but I'll explain again.

315
00:19:30,661 --> 00:19:34,821
After giving birth, the plaintiff suffered from severe postpartum depression.

316
00:19:34,821 --> 00:19:38,191
In that extreme situation, the defendant...

317
00:19:38,191 --> 00:19:41,351
didn't help with domestic chores and childrearing at all

318
00:19:41,351 --> 00:19:42,951
and neglected his wife.

319
00:19:42,951 --> 00:19:45,831
She left because she wanted to live. To live.

320
00:19:45,831 --> 00:19:48,091
At the time when she married the defendant,

321
00:19:48,091 --> 00:19:53,421
didn't you know that an athlete can't devote much time to house chores and childrearing?

322
00:19:53,421 --> 00:19:57,871
The plaintiff first suggested that she would quit work and become a full-time housewife. However...

323
00:19:57,871 --> 00:19:59,881
because it was harder than she thought,

324
00:19:59,881 --> 00:20:02,061
she abandoned everything and left—

325
00:20:02,061 --> 00:20:03,381
What about during the off-season?

326
00:20:03,381 --> 00:20:05,811
Did he help with chores and childrearing during the off-season?

327
00:20:05,811 --> 00:20:06,931
At least, during the off-season—

328
00:20:06,931 --> 00:20:09,211
This isn't about if he helped or not!

329
00:20:09,211 --> 00:20:11,501
Why isn't it? We should point it out clearly before moving on.

330
00:20:11,501 --> 00:20:13,461
The defendant is responsible for the plaintiff's leaving—

331
00:20:13,461 --> 00:20:15,561
Do you plan to keep cutting me off?

332
00:20:15,561 --> 00:20:18,691
Shall we promise not to cut each other off? You cut me off first.

333
00:20:18,691 --> 00:20:20,701
I cut you off when it was okay to cut you off.

334
00:20:20,701 --> 00:20:22,711
Like you, with no hesitating—

335
00:20:22,711 --> 00:20:24,701
- Defendant Representative! 
 - Yes!

336
00:20:24,701 --> 00:20:27,701
Please sit down.

337
00:20:30,491 --> 00:20:32,291
I'm sorry.

338
00:20:36,391 --> 00:20:39,821
You hired such great attorneys.

339
00:20:41,461 --> 00:20:45,561
Your representatives... are very passionate...

340
00:20:45,561 --> 00:20:50,631
as if... this is their personal case, huh?

341
00:20:53,221 --> 00:20:56,221
Don't even talk about it. I'm dumbfounded.

342
00:20:56,221 --> 00:20:57,621
This had never happened before.

343
00:20:57,621 --> 00:21:00,481
She came out of nowhere. What rights does she have?

344
00:21:00,481 --> 00:21:04,041
- You must allow visitation, no matter what. 
 - Must I?

345
00:21:04,041 --> 00:21:07,651
- Yes, it's the mother's legal privilege... 
 -  I slept at 10:00. 

346
00:21:07,651 --> 00:21:09,921
- Let's talk later. 
 -  Tell me honestly. 

347
00:21:09,921 --> 00:21:12,361
What do you mean?

348
00:21:18,591 --> 00:21:20,271
It wasn't you, was it?

349
00:21:20,271 --> 00:21:21,911
What do you mean?

350
00:21:22,861 --> 00:21:25,161
You didn't order Senior Kang and...

351
00:21:26,821 --> 00:21:28,781
Never mind. Forget it.

352
00:21:34,521 --> 00:21:36,951
 They gave me an extra as a promotion. 

353
00:21:36,951 --> 00:21:40,551
 I'm not giving it to you because I'm fond of you, so don't misunderstand. 

354
00:21:40,551 --> 00:21:42,901
 You didn't poison it, did you? 

355
00:21:44,511 --> 00:21:46,771
 You can throw it out, then. 

356
00:21:58,031 --> 00:22:00,941
You wouldn't play that dirty, would you?

357
00:22:00,941 --> 00:22:03,781
You learned enough to know better.

358
00:22:03,781 --> 00:22:06,411
By the way, during the visitation,

359
00:22:06,411 --> 00:22:08,931
Jeong Joon Kyeong doesn't need to be there. Right?

360
00:22:08,931 --> 00:22:10,641
Of course.

361
00:22:14,321 --> 00:22:17,671
What if the child gets scared of her mom she hasn't seen in two years?

362
00:22:17,671 --> 00:22:20,161
Shouldn't I be by her side?

363
00:22:20,161 --> 00:22:24,051
It'll be at the court's visitation room, so the examiner will be there.

364
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:25,351
Don't worry about it.

365
00:22:25,351 --> 00:22:30,681
The examiner will cut her off if she badmouths the father or the like.

366
00:22:30,681 --> 00:22:32,721
Who are you saying will badmouth him?

367
00:22:32,721 --> 00:22:34,891
Such a ridiculous—

368
00:22:34,891 --> 00:22:38,511
Let go. Why can't you say anything?

369
00:22:38,511 --> 00:22:40,751
It's okay. Let's go.

370
00:22:40,751 --> 00:22:42,121
- Excuse me. 
 - Hey...

371
00:22:42,121 --> 00:22:44,241
Pardon.

372
00:22:45,631 --> 00:22:47,091
The next one...

373
00:22:58,551 --> 00:23:01,361
By the way, isn't it not allowed?

374
00:23:01,361 --> 00:23:04,961
One firm... Taking on the other side?

375
00:23:04,961 --> 00:23:09,221
Attorney Goo didn't finish wrapping up his old office,

376
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:11,551
so his name is on there as its CEO.

377
00:23:11,551 --> 00:23:12,901
That's right.

378
00:23:12,901 --> 00:23:15,471
Who do you folks think will win?

379
00:23:15,471 --> 00:23:17,531
Shall we make a bet? Since we're bored?

380
00:23:17,531 --> 00:23:20,261
Come on, it's obviously Attorney Oh.

381
00:23:20,261 --> 00:23:22,921
Come on, you never know.

382
00:23:22,921 --> 00:23:25,581
There could be a surprise, you know?

383
00:23:25,581 --> 00:23:30,461
Anyhow... can they join the company dinner together?

384
00:23:30,461 --> 00:23:32,301
They're enemies.

385
00:23:34,201 --> 00:23:38,241
Seeing how they're both absent, they must be uncomfortable. Right?

386
00:23:38,241 --> 00:23:41,191
He didn't think much of it. He said he had other plans.

387
00:23:41,191 --> 00:23:43,581
That's great. This makes it easier for us to bet.

388
00:23:43,581 --> 00:23:46,931
- Proceed. 
 - Proceed what?

389
00:23:46,931 --> 00:23:51,721
Well... since there's a rare and fun spectacle in our office,

390
00:23:51,721 --> 00:23:55,281
wouldn't it be fun to make bets with that?

391
00:23:56,321 --> 00:23:59,431
Attorney Oh Ha Ra versus Attorney Goo Eun Beom.

392
00:23:59,431 --> 00:24:02,151
- Who do you think will win? 
 - Who bet on whom?

393
00:24:02,151 --> 00:24:04,381
Ms. Jeon and I bet on Attorney Oh.

394
00:24:04,381 --> 00:24:06,221
Mr. Seong bet on Attorney Goo.

395
00:24:06,221 --> 00:24:09,381
- Why did you pick Goo? 
 - I always choose the side with a higher payout.

396
00:24:09,381 --> 00:24:11,831
Attorney Goo will obviously have a higher payout.

397
00:24:11,831 --> 00:24:12,901
You're a pro.

398
00:24:12,901 --> 00:24:16,341
Gosh, how did my friend end up getting treated like this?

399
00:24:16,341 --> 00:24:19,201
Attorney Kwon, then will you bet on Attorney Goo?

400
00:24:19,201 --> 00:24:21,891
No, I should separate business from pleasure.

401
00:24:21,891 --> 00:24:23,231
- How much? 
 - It's 50,000 won.

402
00:24:23,231 --> 00:24:26,061
Is that so? Then, I'll...

403
00:24:26,061 --> 00:24:27,781
double it up and go all in on Attorney Oh.

404
00:24:27,781 --> 00:24:29,371
- Whoa... 
 - Whoa...

405
00:24:29,371 --> 00:24:32,061
Wait!  Only Mr. Seong is betting on Attorney Goo, then?

406
00:24:32,061 --> 00:24:35,901
Gosh, it won't be much money, even if I win.

407
00:24:35,901 --> 00:24:39,641
CEO Hong, to boost the morale of our office, bet on...

408
00:24:39,641 --> 00:24:41,861
- Attorney Goo— 
 - I don't gamble.

409
00:24:41,861 --> 00:24:45,951
H-How is this gambling? This is just entertainment.

410
00:24:45,951 --> 00:24:46,931
- CEO Seo! 
 - Huh?

411
00:24:46,931 --> 00:24:49,321
- You'll join us, right? 
 - Me?

412
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:55,331
Ms. Jeon, don't call CEO Seo by his title, and just call him Han Gil.

413
00:24:55,331 --> 00:24:58,521
Han Gil encourages horizontal speech.

414
00:24:58,521 --> 00:25:00,541
How is it? I did well, right, Han Gil?

415
00:25:00,541 --> 00:25:04,751
- Attorney Kang... you bet on Attorney Oh, then? 
 - Yeah.

416
00:25:04,751 --> 00:25:08,971
In that case... I'll bet on Attorney Goo and...

417
00:25:10,001 --> 00:25:12,501
- go quadruple. 
 -  Whoa! 

418
00:25:12,501 --> 00:25:15,961
Raise. Shall we make a side bet with just us two, Han Gil?

419
00:25:15,961 --> 00:25:18,621
- Okay. Go. 
 - Okay, now then...

420
00:25:18,621 --> 00:25:22,061
The loser uses honorifics to the winner for life and

421
00:25:22,061 --> 00:25:24,531
the winner skips honorifics to the loser for life.

422
00:25:24,531 --> 00:25:26,041
- Deal. 
 - Deal?

423
00:25:26,041 --> 00:25:27,141
- Deal. 
 - Deal?

424
00:25:27,141 --> 00:25:28,581
Deal!

425
00:25:28,581 --> 00:25:31,701
But what do I have to gain from winning?

426
00:25:31,701 --> 00:25:34,241
- It's the same for me. 
 - It's not the same.

427
00:25:34,241 --> 00:25:36,621
I'm going to use horizontal speech for life.

428
00:25:36,621 --> 00:25:40,831
If you want me to use honorifics, you need to win. Fighting!

429
00:25:40,831 --> 00:25:42,531
- Let's go. 
 - Let's go!

430
00:25:42,531 --> 00:25:44,841
I'm going to win whatever it takes.

431
00:25:44,841 --> 00:25:47,691
Fighting!

432
00:25:47,691 --> 00:25:50,361
Did I do something wrong?

433
00:25:53,531 --> 00:25:56,721
Gosh... Look at this guy.

434
00:25:56,721 --> 00:26:00,601
- Over here! An attorney is littering illegally! 
 - Gosh, please.

435
00:26:00,601 --> 00:26:03,661
I was going to pick it up and throw it away.

436
00:26:03,661 --> 00:26:06,391
- Let me have one. 
 - It's all gone.

437
00:26:06,391 --> 00:26:07,801
Stop lying and give me one.

438
00:26:07,801 --> 00:26:09,841
Gosh, why is a chick asking for a cigarette?

439
00:26:09,841 --> 00:26:13,381
You keep saying chick. I'll hit you if you keep it up.

440
00:26:13,381 --> 00:26:17,011
Come on. Gosh, are you drunk?

441
00:26:17,011 --> 00:26:18,421
It's right here.

442
00:26:18,421 --> 00:26:21,731
If you're drunk, go home early. That was the last one, seriously.

443
00:26:21,731 --> 00:26:25,261
- Look here. Look. It's the wrong side. 
 - It's okay.

444
00:26:25,261 --> 00:26:26,791
- I'll toss it. 
 - I can still smoke it. It's okay.

445
00:26:26,791 --> 00:26:28,171
I won't die. It's okay.

446
00:26:28,171 --> 00:26:30,011
Why are you trying to smoke all of a sudden?

447
00:26:30,011 --> 00:26:31,501
What's wrong? Let me have it!

448
00:26:31,501 --> 00:26:33,811
Let me have it! Seriously...

449
00:26:39,971 --> 00:26:43,931
Huh? Did you put cologne on?

450
00:26:43,931 --> 00:26:46,581
This is the one I like.

451
00:26:49,761 --> 00:26:52,611
Who were you trying to impress?

452
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:56,391
- Is it me? 
 - Gosh, seriously... Have you gone mad?

453
00:26:56,391 --> 00:26:58,461
- Is it me? 
 - Is she crazy?

454
00:26:58,461 --> 00:27:00,591
I'm going to go drink.

455
00:27:01,701 --> 00:27:04,101
It's me!

456
00:27:04,101 --> 00:27:06,171
Is it really me?

457
00:27:13,941 --> 00:27:15,781
- Nice cue. 
 - Whoa...

458
00:27:15,781 --> 00:27:17,721
If you get this, then it's game over.

459
00:27:17,721 --> 00:27:19,791
It's not easy.

460
00:27:19,791 --> 00:27:22,241
I'll need to distract you.

461
00:27:23,761 --> 00:27:26,851
You shameless adulterer!

462
00:27:29,511 --> 00:27:32,001
Who taught you such foul billiard manners?

463
00:27:34,361 --> 00:27:38,231
I was really shocked after hearing it from Ha Ra that day.

464
00:27:41,391 --> 00:27:45,941
I heard your cause of divorce was... your affair?

465
00:27:46,751 --> 00:27:49,611
Didn't you say that she's flawless?

466
00:27:49,611 --> 00:27:52,551
You said she's amazing and that it's almost a waste to introduce her to me.

467
00:27:52,551 --> 00:27:54,331
That's right.

468
00:27:54,331 --> 00:27:57,031
I'm telling you, she's great.

469
00:27:57,031 --> 00:27:59,701
She's perfect, except for the one flaw of divorcing me.

470
00:27:59,701 --> 00:28:02,211
But why did you cheat on her, Hyung?

471
00:28:02,211 --> 00:28:05,191
When you had such a perfect person?

472
00:28:05,191 --> 00:28:08,471
It happened in a moment. Things do happen like that.

473
00:28:09,711 --> 00:28:13,351
If it gets long, it sounds like I'm justifying myself. So this is it.

474
00:28:14,501 --> 00:28:21,331
Wow, the more you think you know a person, the less you know.

475
00:28:21,331 --> 00:28:23,781
I thought I knew you well, but

476
00:28:23,781 --> 00:28:27,031
I don't think that's true, either.

477
00:28:28,421 --> 00:28:31,611
You're dissing me indirectly with a P-Turn, huh?

478
00:28:32,911 --> 00:28:35,111
Just go ahead and say it, you punk.

479
00:28:35,111 --> 00:28:37,921
That you can't stand me. Don't say I know you anywhere.

480
00:28:37,921 --> 00:28:42,361
No, that's not it. I'm sure you had your reasons.

481
00:28:42,361 --> 00:28:47,271
The hyung that I know... isn't someone who would do that.

482
00:28:53,781 --> 00:28:55,771
Actually, right now...

483
00:28:56,881 --> 00:28:58,941
we don't contact each other.

484
00:29:00,351 --> 00:29:05,251
We fought... at the bar on the day we met you.

485
00:29:08,571 --> 00:29:10,051
Why?

486
00:29:10,051 --> 00:29:14,631
I think... I was acting a bit childish.

487
00:29:24,181 --> 00:29:26,981
 Thank you for dropping me off. I'm off. 

488
00:29:26,981 --> 00:29:31,511
 Come on. Without a goodbye kiss? 

489
00:29:31,511 --> 00:29:35,701
 I didn't brush my teeth today. Sorry. 

490
00:29:35,701 --> 00:29:38,941
 Okay. I'll let you off the hook today. 

491
00:29:38,941 --> 00:29:42,141
 I'm just too tired. 

492
00:29:42,141 --> 00:29:46,051
 - Next time. 
 - Isn't this wrong? 

493
00:29:49,241 --> 00:29:51,111
 Ever since we bumped into Eun Beom, 

494
00:29:51,111 --> 00:29:54,621
 you've been quiet and keep saying you're tired. 

495
00:29:56,301 --> 00:29:59,561
 Aren't you being a little impolite to me here? 

496
00:29:59,561 --> 00:30:05,721
 So... if I give you a kiss, will it make me polite again? 

497
00:30:05,721 --> 00:30:10,651
 Do I become polite if I do what the other person desires regardless of my feelings? 

498
00:30:10,651 --> 00:30:13,181
 - That's not what I mean— 
 - I... 

499
00:30:14,261 --> 00:30:18,281
 I don't have the energy to listen to you right now. 

500
00:30:18,281 --> 00:30:22,371
 Later... Let's talk later. 

501
00:30:32,501 --> 00:30:37,111
You still haven't... contacted her after that?

502
00:30:38,291 --> 00:30:40,421
She doesn't answer my calls.

503
00:30:41,821 --> 00:30:45,011
Oh, she took in another case recently,

504
00:30:45,011 --> 00:30:47,941
so she's really busy. That's probably why.

505
00:30:47,941 --> 00:30:50,761
- If you wait a little, she'll— 
 - Hyung...

506
00:30:50,761 --> 00:30:54,810
I think this is a really big problem, but...

507
00:30:55,421 --> 00:30:58,811
I guess I like her more than I thought.

508
00:31:03,881 --> 00:31:07,931
I'm scared to death that she'll call it quits.

509
00:31:09,481 --> 00:31:11,751
What do I do?

510
00:31:11,751 --> 00:31:13,941
I think Ha Ra...

511
00:31:16,311 --> 00:31:19,271
hasn't gotten over you yet, Hyung.

512
00:31:27,371 --> 00:31:28,551
Shall we go?

513
00:31:28,551 --> 00:31:31,111
- We'll grab a drink, so give me a call. 
 - Okay.

514
00:31:31,111 --> 00:31:32,951
- Come right away when I call, okay? 
 - Yes, of course.

515
00:31:32,951 --> 00:31:34,641
Okay.

516
00:31:35,041 --> 00:31:39,871
- Gosh, my legs. 
 - Unni, you said you don't need dowry.

517
00:31:39,871 --> 00:31:41,621
You said they're all empty formalities.

518
00:31:41,621 --> 00:31:44,181
Gosh, I said I don't need them,

519
00:31:44,181 --> 00:31:46,631
but they insisted on sending them.

520
00:31:46,631 --> 00:31:49,121
Goodness. It's not like I can send back what was sent to my house.

521
00:31:49,121 --> 00:31:51,581
Ha Ra should've prepared a dowry back then, too.

522
00:31:51,581 --> 00:31:56,901
Even someone who said no to them is happy after receiving them, right?

523
00:31:57,501 --> 00:32:01,251
Yes, I guess that could've been the case.

524
00:32:01,251 --> 00:32:03,971
Why are you bringing up an old story?

525
00:32:03,971 --> 00:32:06,091
Especially when they divorced.

526
00:32:06,091 --> 00:32:08,711
So what? Is being divorced a flaw?

527
00:32:08,711 --> 00:32:10,731
She's a divorce attorney.

528
00:32:10,731 --> 00:32:13,361
She knows being divorced isn't a flaw.

529
00:32:13,361 --> 00:32:15,771
Right, Sweetie?

530
00:32:15,771 --> 00:32:18,161
Gosh, of course.

531
00:32:18,161 --> 00:32:21,801
Nowadays, you have to be competent enough to marry and divorce.

532
00:32:21,801 --> 00:32:23,971
Sung Il... What was it?

533
00:32:23,971 --> 00:32:26,461
He doesn't even have a woman to divorce.

534
00:32:26,461 --> 00:32:29,071
Hey, is that all you got to say?

535
00:32:29,071 --> 00:32:31,001
How rude is that?

536
00:32:31,001 --> 00:32:33,131
Who doesn't have a woman?

537
00:32:33,131 --> 00:32:34,861
Oh, I see...

538
00:32:34,861 --> 00:32:37,171
He has a woman?

539
00:32:37,171 --> 00:32:39,191
I totally thought he wouldn't have anyone.

540
00:32:39,191 --> 00:32:42,281
I'm sorry. So, he is with someone.

541
00:32:42,281 --> 00:32:44,591
I guess we'll get to eat wedding noodles soon.

542
00:32:44,591 --> 00:32:47,901
I mean, it's not that he couldn't get married.

543
00:32:47,901 --> 00:32:51,701
He... He said he wanted to continue studying...

544
00:32:51,701 --> 00:32:54,691
Yes, hello? Oh, yes, sir.

545
00:32:54,691 --> 00:32:56,361
It's a call from my client...

546
00:32:56,361 --> 00:32:58,641
At the law firm.

547
00:32:58,641 --> 00:33:01,601
Yes. Oh, you sent the recording?

548
00:33:01,601 --> 00:33:03,831
 Oh, I see. 

549
00:33:03,831 --> 00:33:05,961
 Yes. 

550
00:33:05,961 --> 00:33:10,321
Okay, I'll check one more time.

551
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:12,221
Yes— Oh, my!

552
00:33:13,431 --> 00:33:14,961
Hello?

553
00:33:14,961 --> 00:33:18,401
Hello, Attorney Oh. Can you talk right now?

554
00:33:19,201 --> 00:33:22,461
Yes, Joon Kyeong. Yes, I can talk. Go ahead.

555
00:33:22,461 --> 00:33:27,371
 It's because Da Wool said she doesn't want to see her mom. 

556
00:33:27,371 --> 00:33:30,521
 Even if visitation is a parent's right, if the child says no, 

557
00:33:30,521 --> 00:33:32,641
we can't force her to meet her.

558
00:33:32,641 --> 00:33:34,881
She doesn't even seem to like her mom that much.

559
00:33:34,881 --> 00:33:38,531
Well, they've been separated too long.

560
00:33:38,531 --> 00:33:41,131
She probably thinks she was abandoned.

561
00:33:41,131 --> 00:33:44,531
So it's natural for her to resent and reject.

562
00:33:44,531 --> 00:33:49,131
Well... there is a thing called the suit against visitations,

563
00:33:49,131 --> 00:33:50,941
but it's meaningless at this stage.

564
00:33:50,941 --> 00:33:54,121
We can only appeal to the examiner.

565
00:33:54,121 --> 00:33:56,831
"The child rejects her mom a lot.

566
00:33:56,831 --> 00:33:59,131
She has a severe repulsion." Like that.

567
00:33:59,131 --> 00:34:02,081
 Is it possible to postpone the visitation? 

568
00:34:02,081 --> 00:34:05,301
After Da Wool feels more ready,

569
00:34:05,301 --> 00:34:08,841
I want to proceed more naturally.

570
00:34:11,231 --> 00:34:14,801
One second, please. Gosh, Sweetie, what woke you up?

571
00:34:15,301 --> 00:34:17,541
 - Is it Mom?  
  - Huh? 

572
00:34:17,541 --> 00:34:19,221
 No. 

573
00:34:19,221 --> 00:34:21,801
It's not Mom. Look.

574
00:34:21,801 --> 00:34:24,301
   

575
00:34:25,261 --> 00:34:27,911
Okay, Da Wool. Sleep tight.

576
00:34:30,441 --> 00:34:32,291
Yes. I'm sorry.

577
00:34:32,291 --> 00:34:33,421
 Okay. 

578
00:34:33,421 --> 00:34:36,361
I'll submit the request for now.

579
00:34:36,361 --> 00:34:38,681
O-Oh, right, about that.

580
00:34:38,681 --> 00:34:42,381
Could you tell me now? I'll write it down.

581
00:34:42,381 --> 00:34:45,351
 Should I just send you a picture of it? 

582
00:34:49,541 --> 00:34:51,581
Yes.

583
00:34:51,581 --> 00:34:54,051
That will be better.

584
00:34:55,281 --> 00:34:56,861
Yes.

585
00:35:09,271 --> 00:35:11,371
   

586
00:35:28,131 --> 00:35:30,021
 Do you... 

587
00:35:30,871 --> 00:35:33,161
 happen to know the title of this song? 

588
00:35:33,161 --> 00:35:34,641
♫  It always  ♫

589
00:35:34,641 --> 00:35:35,671
 What? 

590
00:35:35,671 --> 00:35:38,401
 The song that's playing right now. 

591
00:35:38,401 --> 00:35:43,001
♫  I remember your face  ♫

592
00:35:43,711 --> 00:35:45,401
 I don't. 

593
00:35:45,401 --> 00:35:54,501
♫  My heart that stopped short, you spitefully took my dysfunctional heart  ♫

594
00:35:56,081 --> 00:36:03,581
♫  And your bright smile easily opened my heart  ♫

595
00:36:08,151 --> 00:36:17,941
♫  It's true, that is how I became your man  ♫

596
00:36:17,941 --> 00:36:22,451
♫  All my unpleasant memories  ♫

597
00:36:22,451 --> 00:36:24,031
 The song from yesterday. 

598
00:36:24,031 --> 00:36:27,891
♫  I no longer recall  ♫

599
00:36:27,891 --> 00:36:29,571
 It's this one. 

600
00:36:30,671 --> 00:36:33,601
♫  Because the hand that holds me tight  ♫

601
00:36:33,601 --> 00:36:35,211
 I also found it. 

602
00:36:35,211 --> 00:36:38,381
 I looked it up as soon as I got home yesterday. 

603
00:36:38,381 --> 00:36:40,111
 Thanks. 

604
00:36:41,081 --> 00:36:47,361
♫  And like a dream, my heart remains in your embrace  ♫

605
00:36:47,361 --> 00:36:50,621
 This singer has a concert on weekends. 

606
00:36:50,621 --> 00:36:54,001
♫  Without awakening for a single moment  ♫

607
00:36:54,001 --> 00:36:56,471
 They say he's way better live. 

608
00:37:01,121 --> 00:37:06,751
♫  And if you would always rest by my side like breaths  ♫

609
00:37:06,751 --> 00:37:10,611
♫  If you would remain like that  ♫

610
00:37:10,611 --> 00:37:15,291
♫  Nothing better, nothing better  ♫

611
00:37:15,291 --> 00:37:17,131
 Do you want to go together? 

612
00:37:18,201 --> 00:37:20,501
 I also like that song. 

613
00:37:20,501 --> 00:37:23,091
♫  Nothing better  ♫

614
00:37:23,091 --> 00:37:29,010
♫  Nothing better than you  ♫

615
00:37:41,481 --> 00:37:42,791
 Ha Ra. 

616
00:37:42,791 --> 00:37:45,141
 Sorry. I came so late. 

617
00:37:45,141 --> 00:37:46,871
 The student council ended so late... 

618
00:37:46,871 --> 00:37:48,301
 No, it's okay. 

619
00:37:48,301 --> 00:37:50,971
 But I think you'll have to run again. 

620
00:37:50,971 --> 00:37:52,840
 You can run, right? 

621
00:37:53,291 --> 00:37:54,901
 Let's go. 

622
00:37:56,811 --> 00:37:58,681
 Are you good at running? 

623
00:37:59,561 --> 00:38:02,461
 Ha Ra, hurry up! Hurry! 

624
00:38:09,291 --> 00:38:11,010
 Ha Ra! 

625
00:38:11,911 --> 00:38:13,861
 We're almost there. 

626
00:38:14,611 --> 00:38:16,351
 We're almost there. 

627
00:38:20,351 --> 00:38:21,851
 Let's go. 

628
00:38:21,851 --> 00:38:24,321
 Let's go. Let's go. 

629
00:38:24,321 --> 00:38:26,191
 Let's go! 

630
00:38:26,191 --> 00:38:28,021
 Just a little more! 

631
00:38:31,321 --> 00:38:33,721
 I can see it! 

632
00:38:33,721 --> 00:38:35,651
 Almost there! 

633
00:38:36,771 --> 00:38:39,231
 Please have your tickets ready and wait in line! 

634
00:38:39,231 --> 00:38:41,201
 The concert starts soon. 

635
00:38:41,201 --> 00:38:42,781
 Are you okay? 

636
00:38:43,301 --> 00:38:45,111
 Tickets... Tickets... 

637
00:38:45,111 --> 00:38:46,851
 Wait... 

638
00:38:53,611 --> 00:38:55,301
 Let's go. 

639
00:38:59,051 --> 00:39:00,741
   

640
00:39:00,741 --> 00:39:10,101
♫  And like a dream, my heart remains in your embrace  ♫

641
00:39:10,101 --> 00:39:20,751
♫  Without awakening for a single moment, 
 I dream an endless dream  ♫

642
00:39:20,751 --> 00:39:26,411
♫  And if you would always rest by my side like breaths  ♫

643
00:39:26,411 --> 00:39:30,181
♫  If you would remain like that  ♫

644
00:39:30,181 --> 00:39:32,701
♫  Nothing better  ♫

645
00:39:32,701 --> 00:39:38,801
♫  Nothing better than you  ♫

646
00:39:40,221 --> 00:39:42,701
♫  Nothing better  ♫

647
00:39:42,701 --> 00:39:46,001
♫  Nothing better  ♫

648
00:39:48,601 --> 00:39:54,051
♫  than you  ♫

649
00:39:57,751 --> 00:39:59,761
 Gosh, that was great. 

650
00:39:59,761 --> 00:40:02,291
 - Live is definitely better, right? 
 - Yes. 

651
00:40:02,291 --> 00:40:03,851
 Wait, Eun Beom. 

652
00:40:03,851 --> 00:40:06,491
 Hello, Senior? Did you see the concert? 

653
00:40:06,491 --> 00:40:08,151
 Yes, I came to see the show. 

654
00:40:08,151 --> 00:40:09,581
 Did you two come together? 

655
00:40:09,581 --> 00:40:10,641
 Yes. 

656
00:40:10,641 --> 00:40:12,851
 Were you two always close? 

657
00:40:13,981 --> 00:40:17,181
 Well... the thing is... 

658
00:40:17,181 --> 00:40:19,541
 Yes, we're close. 

659
00:40:19,541 --> 00:40:22,941
 We held hands today and crossed fingers, too. 

660
00:40:22,941 --> 00:40:24,851
 Don't we look good together? 

661
00:40:24,851 --> 00:40:27,101
 Y-Yes, you two look great. 

662
00:40:27,101 --> 00:40:29,551
 - Hey, you want a picture together? 
 - Oh, yes. 

663
00:40:29,551 --> 00:40:30,921
 Here. 

664
00:40:30,921 --> 00:40:33,351
 Take it, so the background comes out nicely. 

665
00:40:33,351 --> 00:40:35,221
 Got it. I'm very good at taking pictures, you know. 

666
00:40:35,221 --> 00:40:38,981
 All right. One, two, three! 

667
00:40:39,701 --> 00:40:48,291
♫  And like a dream my heart remains in your embrace  ♫

668
00:40:48,291 --> 00:40:54,391
♫  Without awakening for a single moment, 
 I dream an endless dream  ♫

669
00:40:54,391 --> 00:40:57,991
Ha Ra, should I set you up on a blind date?

670
00:40:57,991 --> 00:41:01,751
Auntie! Ha Ra will do fine on her own, so just let her be.

671
00:41:01,751 --> 00:41:04,921
She's already in her mid-thirties. How can we let her be?

672
00:41:04,921 --> 00:41:06,361
- Gosh! 
 - We need to rush her!

673
00:41:06,361 --> 00:41:09,511
Gosh, what are you saying? No need to worry!

674
00:41:09,511 --> 00:41:12,271
 If she delays any longer, pregnancy will be difficult. 

675
00:41:12,271 --> 00:41:15,731
 Women have kids even in their forties these days. 

676
00:41:29,611 --> 00:41:31,421
You don't know when to stop.

677
00:41:31,421 --> 00:41:34,431
I mean, am I wrong?

678
00:41:39,021 --> 00:41:40,991
 Gosh, please... 

679
00:41:40,991 --> 00:41:44,381
 Mind your own business, will you? 

680
00:41:44,381 --> 00:41:47,221
 What's so good about marriage that you keep pushing me? 

681
00:41:47,221 --> 00:41:49,981
 Does marriage guarantee happiness? What is marriage? 

682
00:41:49,981 --> 00:41:52,041
 Auntie, you always badmouth your husband, too. 

683
00:41:52,041 --> 00:41:54,141
 You said you put up with him because of your kids. 

684
00:41:54,141 --> 00:41:58,861
 So why the hell do you keep going on about marriage? 

685
00:42:09,951 --> 00:42:11,911
Dad...

686
00:42:12,471 --> 00:42:14,231
said he was going to be late.

687
00:42:14,231 --> 00:42:17,171
He called saying he'll be home early morning.

688
00:42:17,171 --> 00:42:20,211
Brother's going to be late even on his wife's birthday?

689
00:42:20,211 --> 00:42:22,681
He should come home early on days like this.

690
00:42:22,681 --> 00:42:24,651
- Hey, call and say let's go home. 
 - Okay.

691
00:42:24,651 --> 00:42:26,621
- You're leaving? 
 - Yeah.

692
00:42:27,061 --> 00:42:31,441
That's how old people talk. Don't stress about what Auntie said.

693
00:42:31,441 --> 00:42:32,761
Let it go out the other ear.

694
00:42:32,761 --> 00:42:35,761
Forget it. This isn't the first time.

695
00:42:35,761 --> 00:42:38,911
And don't say something you don't mean.

696
00:42:38,911 --> 00:42:40,741
I know you also want me to remarry.

697
00:42:40,741 --> 00:42:43,331
Oh, my gosh. Look at you. Stop it.

698
00:42:43,331 --> 00:42:46,441
You'll remarry when the time is right. What do you mean?

699
00:42:46,441 --> 00:42:48,211
I don't feel rushed at all.

700
00:42:48,211 --> 00:42:51,301
Even if you were, too bad. I don't have a man.

701
00:42:51,301 --> 00:42:53,421
Gosh, honestly.

702
00:42:53,421 --> 00:42:55,551
Seriously.

703
00:42:57,021 --> 00:42:58,531
Give it to me.

704
00:43:02,371 --> 00:43:03,751
Go inside. It's late.

705
00:43:03,751 --> 00:43:06,331
I'll watch you leave.

706
00:43:06,331 --> 00:43:08,731
Don't wait up for Dad and go to sleep.

707
00:43:08,731 --> 00:43:13,251
I gave him a hard time for standing you up on your birthday, so don't be too upset.

708
00:43:13,251 --> 00:43:17,321
Why did you scold him? He's good to me all the time.

709
00:43:17,321 --> 00:43:18,981
Birthdays aren't a big deal.

710
00:43:18,981 --> 00:43:20,011
I guess...

711
00:43:20,011 --> 00:43:24,241
I would've already remarried if I met a man like Dad.

712
00:43:24,241 --> 00:43:26,721
Gosh...

713
00:43:28,841 --> 00:43:31,421
Madam Lim, happy birthday.

714
00:43:31,421 --> 00:43:34,301
Thank you.

715
00:43:35,831 --> 00:43:38,461
I'll use it well.

716
00:43:38,891 --> 00:43:41,951
- I'm going. 
 - Okay, drive carefully.

717
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:43,191
There's not much in there.

718
00:43:43,191 --> 00:43:46,261
It's pretty thick.

719
00:43:46,261 --> 00:43:49,221
The cubed kimchi is ripe. You can eat it right away.

720
00:43:49,221 --> 00:43:50,591
Okay.

721
00:43:50,591 --> 00:43:53,081
I'm leaving. Bye-bye.

722
00:43:59,981 --> 00:44:02,271
She packed so much.

723
00:44:35,561 --> 00:44:37,581
You're late.

724
00:44:46,401 --> 00:44:49,051
I-It's neat...

725
00:44:50,121 --> 00:44:52,591
"What a nice spread."

726
00:44:53,881 --> 00:44:56,631
The two phrases go together.

727
00:44:56,631 --> 00:45:00,141
"It's neat. What a nice spread."

728
00:45:02,791 --> 00:45:05,481
Do I get some kimchi?

729
00:45:06,931 --> 00:45:09,951
I mean, s-since I helped you carry it.

730
00:45:18,791 --> 00:45:20,871
You picked a great day.

731
00:45:20,871 --> 00:45:23,171
You lucked out with all this food.

732
00:45:29,131 --> 00:45:31,351
I'm sorry about last time.

733
00:45:33,071 --> 00:45:35,791
Me, too... Sorry.

734
00:45:35,791 --> 00:45:38,681
No, I was childish.

735
00:45:38,681 --> 00:45:41,801
Is this a game of "Who's more sorry"?

736
00:45:42,691 --> 00:45:47,241
Let's stop here. We can both accept the apology.

737
00:45:52,381 --> 00:45:54,031
Thank you.

738
00:46:00,341 --> 00:46:04,401
I couldn't reach you, so I thought you wanted to end things.

739
00:46:11,161 --> 00:46:13,261
I felt...

740
00:46:13,261 --> 00:46:15,681
really bad...

741
00:46:16,551 --> 00:46:19,451
And I didn't know what to say.

742
00:46:20,481 --> 00:46:24,771
I just... felt complicated.

743
00:46:31,281 --> 00:46:33,831
Because it seemed like you knew.

744
00:46:38,361 --> 00:46:40,211
That...

745
00:46:41,231 --> 00:46:45,811
I'm not over Goo Eun Beom yet.

746
00:46:48,251 --> 00:46:51,681
Gosh, I'm honestly embarrassed

747
00:46:51,681 --> 00:46:54,561
and I know it sounds ridiculous.

748
00:46:54,561 --> 00:46:55,951
But...

749
00:46:56,651 --> 00:46:59,411
that's just how it is.

750
00:46:59,411 --> 00:47:01,701
I can't help it.

751
00:47:04,061 --> 00:47:07,261
Getting over him simply would be weirder.

752
00:47:07,261 --> 00:47:10,961
He's someone you married out of love.

753
00:47:21,261 --> 00:47:23,551
Anyway,

754
00:47:25,241 --> 00:47:28,791
it felt like I was caught red-handed.

755
00:47:29,571 --> 00:47:33,711
I was embarrassed and couldn't find the right words to explain.

756
00:47:35,521 --> 00:47:38,001
And I didn't feel confident.

757
00:47:38,001 --> 00:47:40,781
Confident about what?

758
00:47:46,981 --> 00:47:50,481
But you know, there are many things I'm good at.

759
00:47:52,881 --> 00:47:54,551
Math...

760
00:47:54,551 --> 00:47:56,291
swimming...

761
00:47:56,291 --> 00:47:57,301
and cooking.

762
00:47:57,301 --> 00:47:58,921
Wow.

763
00:47:58,921 --> 00:48:00,821
And...

764
00:48:00,821 --> 00:48:02,551
kissing.

765
00:48:09,801 --> 00:48:11,621
That's it?

766
00:48:11,621 --> 00:48:14,501
- That's a lot less than I— 
 - But...

767
00:48:14,501 --> 00:48:16,871
what I'm most good at...

768
00:48:19,971 --> 00:48:22,171
is waiting.

769
00:48:24,621 --> 00:48:26,911
I can do that better than anyone.

770
00:48:28,291 --> 00:48:30,551
So...

771
00:48:32,651 --> 00:48:34,691
I'm saying it's all right.

772
00:49:30,651 --> 00:49:32,561
What's this?

773
00:49:36,481 --> 00:49:40,161
Geez, it's not even 6:00 a.m. yet. Get more sleep.

774
00:49:40,161 --> 00:49:42,061
The sun.

775
00:49:52,911 --> 00:49:55,721
The clothes should be folded.

776
00:49:55,721 --> 00:49:58,571
Man, look at this mess.

777
00:49:58,571 --> 00:49:59,841
What are you doing?

778
00:49:59,841 --> 00:50:02,301
Well, the clothes are all over the place...

779
00:50:02,301 --> 00:50:05,561
The sun is out, so it's time to wake up.

780
00:50:05,561 --> 00:50:09,501
And we should call our parents to greet them.

781
00:50:09,501 --> 00:50:11,191
What?

782
00:50:12,001 --> 00:50:14,451
Call them to do what?

783
00:50:15,891 --> 00:50:17,691
Is this your first time with a woman?

784
00:50:17,691 --> 00:50:19,571
That's just ridiculous.

785
00:50:19,571 --> 00:50:21,981
Who? Geez, honestly...

786
00:50:21,981 --> 00:50:24,431
Gosh, this is so annoying.

787
00:50:24,431 --> 00:50:26,811
They don't even have hangers.

788
00:50:37,811 --> 00:50:40,641
Where's the bathroom in this place?

789
00:50:40,641 --> 00:50:44,611
Who thinks up a structure like this?

790
00:50:44,611 --> 00:50:47,131
What's with him?

791
00:50:47,131 --> 00:50:50,561
Gosh, he's so tacky.

792
00:50:52,121 --> 00:50:55,001
My child said she didn't want to see me?

793
00:50:55,001 --> 00:50:57,501
They're playing tricks right now

794
00:50:57,501 --> 00:50:59,441
to delay the meeting as much as possible

795
00:50:59,441 --> 00:51:03,061
and prevent the formation of rapport between mother and child.

796
00:51:04,041 --> 00:51:07,451
Da Wool must miss me so much.

797
00:51:07,451 --> 00:51:10,381
That jerk. He's evil.

798
00:51:13,031 --> 00:51:16,841
Is it good for the child to be meeting like this?

799
00:51:16,841 --> 00:51:18,771
 This is a mother's right. 

800
00:51:18,771 --> 00:51:20,211
Whoa...

801
00:51:20,211 --> 00:51:23,401
Da Wool, what's this? What did you make?

802
00:51:23,401 --> 00:51:24,971
It's a guillotine.

803
00:51:24,971 --> 00:51:25,881
What?

804
00:51:25,881 --> 00:51:28,271
You know, the thing that cuts off people's heads.

805
00:51:28,271 --> 00:51:30,931
Oh, I see.

806
00:51:32,381 --> 00:51:35,011
Da Wool, you're such an interesting child.

807
00:51:35,011 --> 00:51:36,431
Liar.

808
00:51:36,431 --> 00:51:40,641
You think I'm weird, not interesting.

809
00:51:40,641 --> 00:51:42,011
No, I don't.

810
00:51:43,051 --> 00:51:45,461
Being weird is interesting.

811
00:51:52,281 --> 00:51:53,551
Jeong Da Wool.

812
00:51:53,551 --> 00:51:56,061
I will come pick you up later.

813
00:51:56,061 --> 00:51:58,091
Have fun with Mom, okay?

814
00:52:01,821 --> 00:52:03,391
Hello?

815
00:52:05,921 --> 00:52:07,821
Hi, Da Wool.

816
00:52:07,821 --> 00:52:10,401
Shall we go meet Mom now?

817
00:52:40,041 --> 00:52:41,451
Well...

818
00:52:42,351 --> 00:52:45,271
for the first visitation,

819
00:52:45,271 --> 00:52:48,671
the examiner says it's natural to feel awkward.

820
00:52:49,781 --> 00:52:52,701
I'm sure time will solve it.

821
00:52:52,701 --> 00:52:54,011
It'll be okay.

822
00:52:54,011 --> 00:52:56,521
That bastard brainwashed her.

823
00:52:57,491 --> 00:53:01,111
Saying I abandoned her and that I'm a bad mother.

824
00:53:01,111 --> 00:53:03,681
And that she mustn't forgive me.

825
00:53:04,611 --> 00:53:06,331
I...

826
00:53:06,331 --> 00:53:08,921
I shouldn't have done that.

827
00:53:10,341 --> 00:53:13,301
I shouldn't have done that, no matter how hard things were.

828
00:53:13,301 --> 00:53:16,091
I shouldn't have run away alone.

829
00:53:17,711 --> 00:53:20,221
I should've taken my child with me.

830
00:53:25,641 --> 00:53:27,551
That card...

831
00:53:28,371 --> 00:53:29,861
Let's use it.

832
00:53:31,251 --> 00:53:35,271
We should submit it as evidence without postponing anymore.

833
00:53:38,211 --> 00:53:42,131
Can we... win if we do that?

834
00:53:45,021 --> 00:53:46,411
Yes.

835
00:54:05,681 --> 00:54:07,901
Yes, it's Kwon Si Wook.

836
00:54:08,981 --> 00:54:10,671
Oh, Cheol.

837
00:54:10,671 --> 00:54:13,361
I quit drinking yesterday, man.

838
00:54:17,321 --> 00:54:20,111
I don't know. There's something like that.

839
00:54:20,111 --> 00:54:22,131
I should just go and die.

840
00:54:22,131 --> 00:54:23,841
Bullshit.

841
00:54:23,841 --> 00:54:26,441
Why have I become such a weak drinker?

842
00:54:26,441 --> 00:54:27,581
Why eat things like that?

843
00:54:27,581 --> 00:54:30,321
Is it the end of the world, you asshole?

844
00:54:36,241 --> 00:54:40,261
I searched Goo Eun Beom's office and...

845
00:54:40,261 --> 00:54:42,541
Are you the FBI or something?

846
00:54:42,541 --> 00:54:46,581
Your victory is my victory. Keep that in mind.

847
00:54:48,391 --> 00:54:49,611
What do you say?

848
00:54:49,611 --> 00:54:52,671
    
 They didn't submit this one piece of evidence and

849
00:54:52,671 --> 00:54:55,721
kept it hidden to use as a last resort.

850
00:54:55,721 --> 00:55:00,491
Wow, Ki Seo Hee is more thorough than I thought.

851
00:55:01,481 --> 00:55:04,021
Or is it Goo Eun Beom?

852
00:55:04,021 --> 00:55:08,031
Anyhow, they usually don't let a domestic abuser have the kid.

853
00:55:08,031 --> 00:55:09,631
You know that, right?

854
00:55:17,441 --> 00:55:20,221
It was once. Just once.

855
00:55:20,221 --> 00:55:23,231
If it's just once, does it not count?

856
00:55:23,231 --> 00:55:26,941
You think the judge will let you go if you hit her only once?

857
00:55:26,941 --> 00:55:28,631
What do we do then?

858
00:55:28,631 --> 00:55:31,110
If they submit this, then do we lose?

859
00:55:31,801 --> 00:55:33,531
Huh? That's not it, right?

860
00:55:33,531 --> 00:55:36,711
We also have a card. Just expose that.

861
00:55:37,961 --> 00:55:40,241
We can't. Things become too complicated.

862
00:55:40,241 --> 00:55:42,861
That's not the issue here. We need to win.

863
00:55:42,861 --> 00:55:45,701
You want me to sit back and let her have custody?

864
00:55:48,231 --> 00:55:50,581
Will you be okay if Seo Hee wins?

865
00:55:52,811 --> 00:55:54,531
For now...

866
00:55:55,681 --> 00:56:00,871
I'll first meet them and seek agreement to keep quiet. Both of us.

867
00:56:00,871 --> 00:56:03,731
Whoa... shit...

868
00:56:20,031 --> 00:56:22,261
   

869
00:56:38,441 --> 00:56:40,301
I'm telling you, you can.

870
00:56:40,301 --> 00:56:41,721
Fighting!

871
00:56:42,891 --> 00:56:44,541
I'm going.

872
00:56:48,201 --> 00:56:49,721
Fighting.

873
00:56:51,451 --> 00:56:53,211
Take care.

874
00:57:03,751 --> 00:57:06,381
   

875
00:57:06,381 --> 00:57:09,321
   

876
00:57:09,321 --> 00:57:11,241
   

877
00:57:11,241 --> 00:57:14,171
You submitted a new piece of evidence, plaintiff?

878
00:57:14,171 --> 00:57:16,091
Yes.

879
00:57:16,091 --> 00:57:20,451
So this is a fracture from assault?

880
00:57:23,001 --> 00:57:24,691
That's correct.

881
00:57:25,981 --> 00:57:29,431
This is a pretty serious injury.

882
00:57:29,431 --> 00:57:32,281
Why are you submitting it now? When it's almost over?

883
00:57:32,281 --> 00:57:36,251
At the time, their place of residence was Gwangju, Jeollnam.

884
00:57:36,251 --> 00:57:38,561
It wasn't easy to collect testimonies from the

885
00:57:38,561 --> 00:57:41,691
nurse and the doctor who worked at Gwangju Hospital at the time.

886
00:57:41,691 --> 00:57:44,731
Because they all scattered around and such.

887
00:57:50,761 --> 00:57:52,391
Your Honor...

888
00:57:52,391 --> 00:57:55,141
we also have additional evidence to submit.

889
00:57:55,141 --> 00:57:57,271
We'll submit them now.

890
00:58:06,611 --> 00:58:09,101
What's this? Why on this day?

891
00:58:09,101 --> 00:58:13,491
I'm sorry. We just now found the data as well.

892
00:58:14,721 --> 00:58:16,421
Our evidence is...

893
00:58:16,421 --> 00:58:20,251
to prove the fact that Plaintiff Ki Seo Hee abandoned her child and husband

894
00:58:20,251 --> 00:58:23,891
and ran away from home, not simply because of depression

895
00:58:23,891 --> 00:58:27,081
but because of an affair...

896
00:58:30,221 --> 00:58:32,611
that she was having at the time.

897
00:58:41,291 --> 00:58:42,971
Your Honor...

898
00:58:43,951 --> 00:58:45,721
that's not true.

899
00:58:45,721 --> 00:58:48,601
That... That isn't true.

900
00:58:48,601 --> 00:58:50,531
Let me read it first.

901
00:58:51,791 --> 00:58:53,611
   

902
00:58:53,611 --> 00:58:56,291
   

903
00:58:57,021 --> 00:58:58,701
Goo Eun Beom...

904
00:59:00,141 --> 00:59:01,881
Goo Eun Beom?

905
00:59:07,901 --> 00:59:09,681
Defendant.

906
00:59:09,681 --> 00:59:14,211
Is this talking about the Plaintiff's Representative?

907
00:59:14,211 --> 00:59:15,851
Yes, that's correct.

908
00:59:15,851 --> 00:59:18,491
Your Honor, one moment, please!

909
00:59:18,491 --> 00:59:21,401
That's not true. T-That's not true.

910
00:59:21,401 --> 00:59:23,411
We never had an affair.

911
00:59:24,501 --> 00:59:25,531
Oh, I...

912
00:59:25,531 --> 00:59:28,841
I can show you right now!

913
00:59:29,581 --> 00:59:30,891
I...

914
00:59:32,311 --> 00:59:34,261
L-Let me...

915
00:59:34,261 --> 00:59:37,731
t-turn on my phone, please.

916
00:59:37,731 --> 00:59:39,531
You see, I...

917
00:59:46,631 --> 00:59:48,571
I wanted to get a divorce...

918
00:59:49,531 --> 00:59:52,861
so I asked her to fake an affair with me.

919
00:59:56,701 --> 00:59:59,061
We never had an affair.

920
01:00:13,221 --> 01:00:14,901
I'm sorry.

921
01:00:18,061 --> 01:00:20,221
Ha Ra...

922
01:00:20,221 --> 01:00:21,821
I'm sorry.

923
01:00:48,921 --> 01:00:51,051
 We didn't have to divorce! 

924
01:00:52,091 --> 01:00:53,731
 What happened to you? 

925
01:00:53,731 --> 01:00:55,411
 I'll explain everything. 

926
01:00:55,411 --> 01:00:57,951
 That asshole lacks socialization, seriously. 

927
01:00:57,951 --> 01:00:59,641
 Why do I always make the worst choice? 

928
01:00:59,641 --> 01:01:02,811
 Other people seem to marry easily and live happily ever after. 

929
01:01:02,811 --> 01:01:05,481
 Life's default setting value isn't happiness, is it? 

930
01:01:05,481 --> 01:01:09,761
 Why do you like me? I do everything as I please. 

931
01:01:09,761 --> 01:01:12,961
 What kind of an absurd trial is this? 

932
01:01:13,911 --> 01:01:16,791
♫  Even if I think again  ♫

933
01:01:16,791 --> 01:01:20,681
