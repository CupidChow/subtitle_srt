1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:08,930


2
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:12,120
   

3
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:14,380
   

4
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,460
   

5
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:41,760
   

6
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,600
   

7
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,570
Do you want to look around?

8
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:35,900
Oh, should I?

9
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:37,040
Yeah.

10
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,230
- I'm going to wash up. 
 - Okay.

11
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:41,980
Y-You can g-go.

12
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:45,430
- Take a look around. 
 - Okay.

13
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:08,300
Oh...

14
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:10,000
my!

15
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:19,550
   

16
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:23,880
I thought my heart was going to stop.

17
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:27,260
But how could she not tell her son she was coming back to Korea?

18
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:29,360
She actually did.

19
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,180
She was supposed to come back next week,

20
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:33,380
but came a few days earlier.

21
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:36,880
But she wanted to surprise him, so she didn't tell him.

22
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:42,820
There should be a law against surprises.

23
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:44,350
My sentiments exactly.

24
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:47,180
And? Did you get kicked right out?

25
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:49,090
No.

26
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:54,750
I was interrogated then and there in my state of nakedness.

27
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:57,150
Just kidding.

28
00:03:58,010 --> 00:03:59,260
Yes.

29
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:01,590
All right, Mom.

30
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:03,240
Okay, rest up.

31
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,090
Sure.

32
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:08,710
What did she say?

33
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:10,730
Mom said she was very sorry.

34
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:15,040
She wants to eat a meal together, so she can give you a proper apology.

35
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,000
Gosh, what a relief.

36
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:22,030
I'm the one who's really sorry.

37
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:24,860
She's staying at a hotel because of me.

38
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:26,440
I should've just gone home.

39
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,990
It's okay. She prefers hotels.

40
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:30,840
She says it's more comfortable.

41
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:34,390
My mom has a mania for hotels.

42
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:37,390
- Even so... 
 - Don't worry and go dry your hair.

43
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:39,440
You'll catch a cold.

44
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,910
Should I dry it for you?

45
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:46,280
Why would you do that? I'm not a child.

46
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,100
It's because I want to dry it for you.

47
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:50,870
Hold on. I'll bring the dryer.

48
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:56,560
Oh, wait.

49
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,240
Take me home after you dry my hair.

50
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,040
- You want to go home? 
 - Yeah.

51
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:06,930
Take me home, and at least stop by the hotel to meet your mom.

52
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:14,720
To look at the bright side, you showed your naked body at the first meeting.

53
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,420
You won't have to act too polite and stuff.

54
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:20,720
You should rub her back in the sauna one day.

55
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,130
Am I her daughter-in-law?

56
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:25,660
Jae Gyeom and I only started dating yesterday.

57
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:29,470
Hey, at our age, if the conditions are okay and you are thinking about marriage,

58
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:31,970
then you just marry as if you're frying beans in lightning.
  (Korean idiom that means "at the speed of lightning") 

59
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:37,380
The beans haven't even touched the lightning yet, though?

60
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:43,170
She keeps saying she's sorry.

61
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:46,470
She wants to meet up for a meal to properly apologize,

62
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:48,860
but I turned her down.

63
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:52,140
I barely decided to start a relationship with him.

64
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:54,490
But why should I meet his family?

65
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:57,170
Who knows what will happen between us?

66
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:01,690
Seeing how he didn't filter anything and told you straight,

67
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:04,870
he seems to be wanting to meet together.

68
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:09,390
Does he lack common sense?

69
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:12,220
Or is he really...

70
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:14,800
He must really like you.

71
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:22,180
Hey, come on. Let me borrow some.

72
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:23,510
I know you have some saved up.

73
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:24,730
I said, I don't.

74
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:28,450
I really don't have jack shit. Believe me, man.

75
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:29,930
This guy...

76
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:32,360
Do I need to do a property check on you?

77
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,490
Sure, go ahead.

78
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:35,320
You can even do a fact-check with the bank.

79
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,940
You'll probably cry for me out of pity.

80
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:38,330
Come on, help me out.

81
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:40,190
I don't have it.

82
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:42,020
But why are you moving all of a sudden?

83
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:44,830
You said it's nice and close to work.

84
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:46,720
Is something wrong with the place?

85
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,320
No, the place is fine.

86
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:55,080
I think I'll be in a problematic relationship with the landlord's daughter.

87
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,790
Daughter?

88
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:06,200
Well...

89
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:12,800
I can't be a good father to Da Wool, Seo Hee.

90
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,290
What do you mean? You're the best fit.

91
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:19,510
You're good at cooking, cleaning, and even playing with kids—

92
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:23,030
Hey, that's because she was my client's daughter.

93
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:24,690
I'm not usually good with kids.

94
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:27,840
Don't tell me that. I know better.

95
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:32,550
You basically raised Eun Byeol yourself since your mother was busy.

96
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:36,160
I'd rather not talk about that.

97
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:42,530
Also, isn't it wrong to be asking me out because you think I'd be good with your kid?

98
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:45,020
That's not the reason I'm asking you out.

99
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:47,530
It's not like I'm looking for a babysitter.

100
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:50,440
That's still part of the reason, though.

101
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:53,520
Of course, it's a part of it.

102
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:57,780
I mean, you and I are both divorced at this age.

103
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:02,630
You can't just date someone by being madly in love without looking at the conditions.

104
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:06,970
You know it's impossible.

105
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:12,560
- So you said you'll think about it? 
 - Yeah.

106
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,220
Looks like you won't date her anyway.

107
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:15,940
You're thinking about moving first.

108
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:17,860
I really don't think she's it.

109
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:18,780
Because of the kid?

110
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:20,280
That's part of it, but...

111
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,790
Well...

112
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:23,090
Anyhow, it's complicated.

113
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:25,380
For it to be not complicated...

114
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:28,370
No way... You want to date someone who has never married?

115
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:31,180
- Hey, what are you... 
 - What? What? Single what?

116
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:32,360
Goo Eun Beom is looking for a single woman?

117
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,460
- No— 
 - Hey, your ex-husband is amazing.

118
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:35,900
What? What's amazing?

119
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,520
- No, nothing. 
 - It's not amazing, but...

120
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:40,510
- So many women come at him— 
 - Hey!

121
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:44,070
You talk too much.

122
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:45,530
Why did he cut him off?

123
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:47,580
Seriously...

124
00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:00,600
   

125
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,580
 Same hotel at seven o'clock. 

126
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,990
Yes?

127
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:29,520
Have you eaten?

128
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:33,310
What about you?

129
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:35,640
I had my lunch.

130
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:39,940
You're busy nowadays, aren't you?

131
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:44,210
How many ongoing cases do you have right now?

132
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:48,360
I'm not busy at all.

133
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:51,940
You can feel free to give me work if you need to.

134
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:01,160
Just now my daughter visited.

135
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:02,970
The eldest one.

136
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:08,900
It's been exactly 13 years since I last saw her.

137
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:14,100
She came to me with a divorce complaint filed by her husband.

138
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:23,230
Did I tell you that I divorced because of my in-laws?

139
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:30,470
That man was always on his mother's side when we were living together.

140
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:34,390
But when it was time for his daughter to marry...

141
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:37,840
I guess he was worried about her in-laws giving her a hard time.

142
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,290
I was wondering...

143
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:47,170
why he married her off into a poor family,

144
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:50,040
which he obviously wouldn't be satisfied with.

145
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,280
I guess he wanted...

146
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:55,310
a son-in-law who lives with his wife's family.

147
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:58,070
Looks like he had the kids live right by him

148
00:10:58,070 --> 00:11:02,410
and acted like an ill, wicked father-in-law.

149
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:05,200
Seriously...

150
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,950
Of all things to learn from his mom,

151
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:10,670
he learned to become a mean in-law?

152
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,480
My goodness...

153
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:18,650
Does that mean the son-in-law sent the divorce complaint because of

154
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:21,410
his father-in-law?

155
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,210
Gosh, that moron...

156
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:33,560
He didn't mature with age at all.

157
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:44,020
   

158
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:49,770
Yes.

159
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:52,760
What's this? You can't join the dinner tonight?

160
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,060
I'm sorry.

161
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:56,670
I got an urgent matter to resolve for work.

162
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:58,440
Oh, is that so?

163
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,490
That's problematic.

164
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:04,140
My mom said she reserved for three an expensive restaurant

165
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,840
her friend owns to treat us today.

166
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:09,470
Is it seriously urgent?

167
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:12,140
What? Your mother?

168
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:14,440
You didn't tell me that.

169
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:17,360
I said I really don't need an apology.

170
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,960
You should've told me that first.

171
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:22,420
Mom was begging me so much, saying

172
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:25,780
it would bother her if she went back to the U.S. like this.

173
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:28,120
So I couldn't help it, either.

174
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,090
Wait a moment, then.

175
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:40,680
When is your mother going back again?

176
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,110
Who is it?

177
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,260
- Hi. 
 - Have you had dinner?

178
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:55,110
No, the time is...

179
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:58,800
We're having a party for Da Wool's discharge from the hospital on the rooftop.

180
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,310
Why don't you come join us?

181
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:03,110
I was in the middle of cleaning.

182
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:04,740
Gosh, come on!

183
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:06,720
Pause for a minute.

184
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,580
We started the grill, so hurry.

185
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,670
Oh, well...

186
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,760
You're a guest today, so be at home and eat a lot.

187
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,680
Thank you.

188
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:24,470
Da Wool, are you eating up?

189
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:29,590
I really tried to stop them.

190
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:33,050
My father insisted on inviting you to thank you for the custody case

191
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:35,030
and the ride to the hospital.

192
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:36,880
I told them you'll find it cumbersome.

193
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,120
I got it. It's okay.

194
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,560
Help yourselves.

195
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,220
By the way, have you caught a ladybug before, mister?

196
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:48,420
A ladybug?

197
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:51,290
Da Wool, let's take a bite and chat.

198
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,700
There's a ladybug over there.

199
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:57,150
Oh, really?

200
00:13:57,150 --> 00:14:01,630
- Then, shall we go catch it after you're done eating? 
 - Really?

201
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:04,660
Yes, but only if you finish everything.

202
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:08,790
Mister said you need to finish everything before catching a ladybug, right?

203
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:11,210
Let's hurry up and eat.

204
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:14,120
My arm's about to fall off. Say, "Ah."

205
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:16,720
There you go.

206
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:30,580
How is it? Do you like the food?

207
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:34,700
Yes, it's all so delicious.

208
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,950
Goodness, I'm so glad.

209
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:41,440
Does this make up for at least a tenth of the points I lost?

210
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,600
Oh, well, if it's because of last time,

211
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:47,010
it's really okay.

212
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:52,280
I'm actually the one who's sorry for showing you such a spectacle.

213
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:57,750
Also, I'm sorry for making you go to the hotel.

214
00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:00,430
In that case, let's do it this way.

215
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:02,850
Let's just say that our last meeting didn't happen,

216
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:05,320
and this is our first time meeting.

217
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:09,050
- How is it? 
 - Yes, I like it.

218
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:17,500
Ha Ra, I heard you're a divorce lawyer.

219
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,840
It's so awesome... A lawyer.

220
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,450
No, not at all.

221
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:24,070
Thank you for the compliment.

222
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:27,500
Don't you find it hard to understand people who come to get a divorce?

223
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:31,970
You haven't been married yet, so don't you find it puzzling?

224
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:34,330
If you've never been married, it'd be tough to empathize.

225
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:37,650
So it must be tough to defend the client.

226
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,340
Well...

227
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:46,920
I have been...

228
00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:49,600
married.

229
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:56,290
I've been married once.

230
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:59,100
Oh, but I don't have kids.

231
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,620
Oh, my. What are you going to, Kiddo?

232
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:11,040
You're so outclassed.

233
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:14,430
You'll need to learn a lot from Ha Ra.

234
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:15,980
Will you be okay?

235
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:20,530
He hasn't been divorced yet and is still quite immature.

236
00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:28,220
You know, a person matures a lot from having divorced once.

237
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:34,400
I'm experienced, but I haven't matured enough, so...

238
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,470
It's okay.

239
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:40,520
Gosh, how fortunate.

240
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:45,730
I thought I'd have to beg someone here to get a divorce with me.

241
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:50,010
How silly.

242
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:51,460
Let's toast.

243
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:53,310
Cheers.

244
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,530
Seriously.

245
00:16:58,170 --> 00:17:00,380
Hold my hand.

246
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:02,860
- Did you have fun today, Da Wool? 
 - Yes, it was fun.

247
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:04,830
Me, too.

248
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,460
Da Wool.

249
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:10,680
- Goodbye. 
 - Yes.

250
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,380
Please take care, Mister.

251
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:14,030
Okay.

252
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:18,160
You need to also say, "Thank you for playing with me today."

253
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:22,020
Thank you for playing with me today.

254
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:23,250
Me, too.

255
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:26,120
And please play with me again next week!

256
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:27,940
Well...

257
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:29,490
Okay, if I'm not busy.

258
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:32,090
Are you busy next week?

259
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:33,700
He could be.

260
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:36,070
Mister doesn't have much free time, Da Wool.

261
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:39,850
But next week is Da Wool's birthday...

262
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:41,750
Your birthday?

263
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:49,250
Okay, then I'll buy you a present even if I'm busy.

264
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:51,980
Tell me if you want anything.

265
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,110
- A present? 
 - Yes.

266
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,730
A lipstick, please.

267
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:05,910
Okay.

268
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:07,630
Take care.

269
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:09,990
Let's go.

270
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,950
It'll be disadvantageous for us if it goes to verdict.

271
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:46,560
Since there is too much evidence.

272
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:49,890
So, let's do our best to convince him

273
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:52,600
through adjustment, listening to any demands

274
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:56,800
he has to keep the marriage going.

275
00:19:58,070 --> 00:20:00,420
Will he be convinced?

276
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:06,340
He didn't even look me in the eyes when I begged on my knees.

277
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:11,360
What do you like so much about your husband?

278
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:16,380
Is breaking up not an option for you?

279
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:22,030
What do you like about him that much, exactly?

280
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:26,510
Because he's affectionate.

281
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:28,970
He talks kindly...

282
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:30,850
and never gets angry.

283
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:32,950
You liked an affectionate man...

284
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:35,760
because your dad's scary, huh?

285
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:42,910
We do not want adjustment, Your Honor.

286
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:45,380
    
 We'd like a verdict as soon as possible.

287
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:49,880
Why don't you decide after talking to the plaintiff, at least?

288
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:52,420
We discussed the matter thoroughly.

289
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:54,310
Please proceed with haste, Your Honor.

290
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:55,520
You heard, right?

291
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:59,700
Since the plaintiff is determined, an adjustment will be difficult, Defendant Representative.

292
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:10,750
What about calling the housekeeper a witness?

293
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:12,770
And then do what?

294
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:17,410
We'll have her testify that the couple had a good relationship.

295
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:24,220
Since the court will consider whether the couple's relationship is irreparable or not.

296
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:29,320
It could be our poison instead.

297
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:32,840
It'll only expose my ex-husband's lowly behavior and character

298
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:35,110
during the counter-examination.

299
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:39,670
I don't need to see to know how rudely he treats other people.

300
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:41,770
Unless you're better than him,

301
00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:45,390
he looks down on you as if you're a servant.

302
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:48,950
What kind of married life did you live, CEO Hong?

303
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:51,670
It'll take 1,000 nights to tell.

304
00:21:51,670 --> 00:21:53,310
Oh, you're back.

305
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:56,550
Attorney Oh, you have a guest.

306
00:21:57,090 --> 00:21:58,950
Work hard.

307
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:05,460
M-Mother...

308
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:21,250
Mother... what brings you here?

309
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:24,190
Am I too rude? Without even contacting first...

310
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:28,120
O-Oh... No... Well...

311
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:31,930
Did Jae Gyeom tell you about this place?

312
00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:34,270
Of course, he told me.

313
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:37,330
How else would I know?

314
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:41,060
I actually stopped by...

315
00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:45,370
to give you this before I go.

316
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:50,840
You know, back then...

317
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:54,580
Jae Gyeom didn't tell me in advance.

318
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:57,610
That you've been divorced.

319
00:22:57,610 --> 00:23:00,900
I think you must've been very flustered.

320
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:03,030
My son lacks common sense, so

321
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:05,980
he made you say that at such a meeting.

322
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:10,000
Not at all. It could happen.

323
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:13,410
   

324
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:17,250
Even if you try to be confident all the time,

325
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:22,740
you always feel embarrassed and ashamed for no reason, don't you?

326
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:24,760
I know very well.

327
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:32,930
In that sense, I am apologizing in Jay's place, so...

328
00:23:32,930 --> 00:23:38,110
Oh, Jay is Jae Gyeom's American nickname.

329
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:42,170
Please look at Jay with a generous mind, okay?

330
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:45,270
I scolded him myself as well.

331
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:49,000
Well, you didn't have to do that.

332
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:11,460
That was... Jae Gyeom's mother earlier. Right?

333
00:24:15,310 --> 00:24:17,380
You know, the lady...

334
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:21,850
who was here after you came back from the trial with CEO Hong.

335
00:24:21,850 --> 00:24:25,410
How did you know she's Jae Gyeom's mother?

336
00:24:25,410 --> 00:24:27,830
I've met her before...

337
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:30,310
at his older brother's wedding.

338
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,700
I guess you two are in a serious relationship?

339
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:38,310
His mother coming to the office and all.

340
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:42,520
Did you set a date without the blind date mediator knowing?

341
00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:46,720
Stop overreacting!

342
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,250
I'm about to cancel being a couple right now.

343
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:52,120
We did agree to date officially, but

344
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:56,470
it really hasn't been long since we dated. But...

345
00:24:56,470 --> 00:24:59,190
he keeps making me meet his mother.

346
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:01,000
When you find it burdensome?

347
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,220
Of course, it's burdensome.

348
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:05,770
We don't know how things will go in the future.

349
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:09,430
I mean, she really treats me well, so...

350
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:12,760
I wonder if I'm bad for finding it burdensome.

351
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:17,560
Jae Gyeom should've cut it off in the middle, but he didn't do it at all, huh?

352
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:19,420
Exactly!

353
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:20,760
Why is he like that?

354
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:23,760
Because men normally...

355
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,920
don't think deeply in general.

356
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:28,390
They think others like what they like, so

357
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:32,210
they think their girlfriend or wife will like their moms as well,

358
00:25:32,210 --> 00:25:35,120
since they like them.

359
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,990
But you weren't like that.

360
00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:39,930
You tried so hard not to let me and your mother meet.

361
00:25:39,930 --> 00:25:44,320
I almost felt embarrassed because you cut off your mother so much.

362
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:50,260
You realized that now? It's hard to meet a man like me.

363
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:54,010
It'll be endless once you start comparing Jae Gyeom and me.

364
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:56,740
So it'll be better for you not to.

365
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:58,270
Give me a break.

366
00:25:58,270 --> 00:26:02,110
Hey. Jae Gyeom's better than you in every way except for that.

367
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:04,520
What baseless confidence...

368
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:06,220
- In every way? 
 - Yes.

369
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:08,240
Every single way.

370
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:14,770
Okay, then... I'm glad.

371
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:29,420
 He's being jealous. 

372
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:31,120
Jealous?

373
00:26:31,770 --> 00:26:32,860
Really?

374
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:36,120
Hey... What did I say?

375
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:42,260
Even Goo Eun Beom can't do much when he's compared man to man.

376
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:44,040
Was he seriously offended?

377
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:46,560
Stop caring about him.

378
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:49,530
He'd compare you and Ki Seo Hee, wouldn't he?

379
00:26:49,530 --> 00:26:51,390
Ki Seo Hee?

380
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:56,260
No...Well...

381
00:26:57,470 --> 00:27:01,760
He seems to be trying to work something out with Ki Seo Hee.

382
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,380
What?

383
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:06,640
How did you find out?

384
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:14,780
I happened to overhear him talking to Kwon.

385
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:19,010
Gosh, seriously.

386
00:27:19,010 --> 00:27:21,660
This is ridiculous.

387
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:24,430
Unni, where are you right now? Are you home?

388
00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:27,110
-  If you're home-  
 - N-No, I'm outside right now.

389
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:28,750
At this time?

390
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:31,190
Outside where?

391
00:27:31,970 --> 00:27:33,010
Friend's house.

392
00:27:33,010 --> 00:27:36,510
 Are you drinking again? Drink in moderation, seriously. 

393
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:39,260
You said you're going home early because you're tired.

394
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:42,010
 Huh? My friend's sick, 

395
00:27:42,010 --> 00:27:44,340
so I came out.

396
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:48,820
 Okay. It can't be helped, I guess. It's your friend's place. 

397
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:51,160
Hurry up and get back. Hang up.

398
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:53,360
Okay, I got it.

399
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:56,640
Yes, get home safe. Okay.

400
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,570
-  I'll text you.  
 - Okay.

401
00:27:58,570 --> 00:28:00,380
Bye.

402
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:12,580
What's up now, at this hour?

403
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:14,590
Isn't it enough being together all day in the office?

404
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:17,890
Geez, what about you and me in that case?

405
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:23,060
We can't even lock eyes in the office.

406
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:30,570
How long are we going to keep meeting in secret like this?

407
00:28:30,570 --> 00:28:33,090
What's this? Why is it so red?

408
00:28:33,090 --> 00:28:35,940
- Come on now. 
 - It's red because it's chicken feet.

409
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,700
    
 When they were on their honeymoon,

410
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:42,360
he called me and said this.

411
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:45,900
    
 My Sae Na finds it uncomfortable to talk to elders.

412
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,960
    
 So don't call her whenever you please.

413
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:50,510
Goodness, what do you mean, whenever I please?

414
00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:52,740
"Don't think lightly of her because she's your daughter-in-law...

415
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:55,560
and call her whenever you please."

416
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:59,250
He also told me absolutely not to think of her as a daughter.

417
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:05,080
However, Moon Hyeok Soo called his son-in-law, Park Seung Hwa, whenever he pleased...

418
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:09,160
Why are you showing up now when I called you ages ago?

419
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:11,400
I'm sorry. There was traffic on the way.

420
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:15,900
On the way, stop by the pharmacy to pick up a hangover cure.

421
00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:25,490
Father-in-law...

422
00:29:32,050 --> 00:29:33,820
Drive carefully and hurry up.

423
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:35,250
- All right. 
 - Okay.

424
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:40,680
 and ordered him around like a driver and a secretary. Did you know that? 

425
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,590
I didn't know at all.

426
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:44,730
Since he doesn't talk about those things at all.

427
00:29:44,730 --> 00:29:50,480
My world fell apart when I heard this from my son recently.

428
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:53,430
Gosh, just because he's rich...

429
00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:57,870
It's not like we sold our son off to a wealthy family.

430
00:29:57,870 --> 00:29:59,520
- Goodness, you! 
 - Dad!

431
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,680
- He's hopeless! 
 - Stop it, seriously!

432
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:05,710
 Why lay his hands on someone else's precious son? 

433
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,950
    
 Thank you for your response, Witness.

434
00:30:09,950 --> 00:30:12,720
Plaintiff Representative, any more questions?

435
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:15,550
No, that's all. I'm done.

436
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:17,910
Please proceed with the counter-examination.

437
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:23,650
   

438
00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:27,230
I'll proceed with the counter-examination.

439
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:32,390
Plaintiff Park Seung Hwa is the witness' second son. Is that correct?

440
00:30:32,390 --> 00:30:33,150
Yes.

441
00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:35,130
Witness' first son, in other words,

442
00:30:35,130 --> 00:30:38,110
Plaintiff Park Seung Hwa's older brother, Park Jin Soo...

443
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:42,260
got a divorce in 2015.

444
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:49,110
Could you perhaps tell us about the cause of divorce for your oldest son and his wife?

445
00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:52,830
I don't remember too much in detail.

446
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:54,840
There are many causes.

447
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:58,730
In that case, I'll check the facts in your place.

448
00:30:58,730 --> 00:31:01,160
You just need to say yes or no.

449
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:05,970
According to the facts laid out in the sentencing...

450
00:31:05,970 --> 00:31:09,010
"The mother-in-law Son Yong Shim...

451
00:31:09,010 --> 00:31:11,990
wasn't happy with the dowry her daughter-in-law brought,

452
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:14,300
so for almost a decade,

453
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:17,510
she brought that up and would verbally abuse her on a regular basis."

454
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:22,200
And "when the couple had a big fight over the husband's engagement in prostitution,

455
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,920
she blamed her daughter-in-law for not understanding a man's social life

456
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:27,520
and attempted to kick her out instead."

457
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:31,410
- And— 
 - All of that... is a fabrication!

458
00:31:31,410 --> 00:31:33,920
I've never done these things, Your Honor!

459
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:36,170
All of that is a lie!

460
00:31:36,170 --> 00:31:38,810
I've never done that!

461
00:31:38,810 --> 00:31:41,630
Are you saying the sentencing...

462
00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:45,570
is a wrongful verdict caused by the judges who

463
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:48,780
failed to check the facts correctly?

464
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:50,720
That's right!

465
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:53,110
Th-That judge was really frustrating

466
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:56,090
and was so ignorant about things.

467
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:00,890
I see.

468
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:04,170
That's all.

469
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:11,640
   

470
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:20,100
Isn't this place pretty nice?

471
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:21,640
Yes.

472
00:32:22,810 --> 00:32:26,130
- Did you have a lot of work today? 
 - A little.

473
00:32:26,130 --> 00:32:30,690
There were two trials and many consultations.

474
00:32:32,030 --> 00:32:35,960
Well, um— N-No, you can go ahead.

475
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:38,280
You go ahead.

476
00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:43,340
- Could you take some days off in May, by any chance? 
 - Huh?

477
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:46,960
Actually, my... mother's birthday is in May.

478
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:51,570
She's asking about a family trip to Hawaii, so...

479
00:32:51,570 --> 00:32:54,850
- if you have some time— 
 - I can't make time.

480
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:05,490
We take days off altogether in July when the court is on a break.

481
00:33:05,490 --> 00:33:07,430
Also...

482
00:33:12,530 --> 00:33:15,370
we're not even family yet.

483
00:33:15,370 --> 00:33:19,140
So it's uncomfortable to meet your mother so often.

484
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:22,980
Although it's still uncomfortable when we're a family.

485
00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:28,810
Just so you know, I didn't meet Goo Eun Beom's mother once

486
00:33:28,810 --> 00:33:31,410
even during the 10 years of dating.

487
00:33:31,410 --> 00:33:35,480
Even after marrying, I didn't meet her that often, either.

488
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:43,140
Are you... saying I must follow in Eun Beom's steps or...

489
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:44,970
are you asking me to?

490
00:33:44,970 --> 00:33:47,080
Sure, I get it.

491
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:50,470
I'm sorry for being hasty and making you feel uncomfortable, but...

492
00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:53,620
why don't you tell me these things to me first?

493
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:55,500
Instead of Eun Beom.

494
00:33:57,290 --> 00:34:03,140
I can't understand why I'm called an idiot by Eun Beom regarding my mom.

495
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:11,470
 What are you saying? 

496
00:34:11,470 --> 00:34:13,760
Why would you tell him about that?

497
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:17,990
What I said about Jae Gyeom and me should've been kept between us.

498
00:34:17,990 --> 00:34:23,640
No, it was... a stock trading study over the weekend.

499
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:27,400
It was a passing topic while talking about his mom.

500
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:31,120
 His mom came to the office, and I saw her anyway. 

501
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,710
Couldn't I say a word or two in that case?

502
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:37,140
Even so, why would you act high and mighty, calling him an idiot?

503
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:40,920
I complimented you once for that, and you get so cocky.

504
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:45,900
Hey, I wasn't getting cocky. He was just talking like an idiot.

505
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:48,950
 Other people in the study said the same thing. 

506
00:34:48,950 --> 00:34:51,240
"You keep talking about friendly this and that,

507
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:53,750
but what kind of friendliness is there between in-laws?

508
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:56,950
You need to wake up unless you're completely senseless."

509
00:34:56,950 --> 00:34:58,830
This is ridiculous.

510
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:02,570
So why would you introduce me to such a senseless guy in the first place?

511
00:35:02,570 --> 00:35:05,460
Seriously, you said he's better than me in every single way.

512
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:08,490
Hey, were you that offended by that?

513
00:35:08,490 --> 00:35:10,240
What do you mean offended?

514
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:13,200
You were offended. You're being petty even now.

515
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,960
No, I'm not.

516
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,610
Who's that?

517
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:21,520
Who is it?

518
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,760
 It's me, Seo Hee! 

519
00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:28,610
Looks like you have a guest.

520
00:35:28,610 --> 00:35:30,180
Hang up.

521
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:37,110
 Why do I care about Goo Eun Beom and Ki Seo Hee? 

522
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:39,260
 They're nothing to me. 

523
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:44,050
 Gosh, let's not care. Just let them be. 

524
00:35:51,570 --> 00:35:52,950
Hey, you could've waited.

525
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:56,820
Why bring it here to eat past 10 o'clock at night?

526
00:35:56,820 --> 00:36:00,970
Da Wool wanted to come with me, so I had to put her to sleep first.

527
00:36:02,050 --> 00:36:05,940
Hey, how could you cut a mango better than me?

528
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:10,230
My mom smacked my back before when I was cutting mango like how you cut an apple.

529
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:14,350
Hey... How could you cut mango like an apple?

530
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:16,920
You're quite creative, too.

531
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:20,550
Right? Wouldn't it be fun to live with me?

532
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:22,590
Seo Hee...

533
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:26,750
You see... I gave this a lot of thought, but...

534
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:31,890
What's this? What's this ominous vibe?

535
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:37,780
I think it'll be... better for me to move out.

536
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:39,340
I'm sorry.

537
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:48,060
This means... you're rejecting me right now, aren't you?

538
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:51,200
You said this before.

539
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:55,780
"You can't just date someone by being madly in love

540
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:58,340
without looking at the conditions."

541
00:36:58,340 --> 00:37:02,670
But in my perspective, even the crazy love I took all the way

542
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:04,710
eventually broke up after marrying.

543
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:09,040
So starting something... without even being madly in love?

544
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:13,200
I don't know why I should bother with that.

545
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:20,270
For me... you were by my side when I was down and

546
00:37:20,270 --> 00:37:23,240
I was by your side when you were down.

547
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:27,190
So I thought we could be like that from now on as well.

548
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:32,110
But that was possible because we were friends.

549
00:37:34,530 --> 00:37:38,220
You were the one who treated me well, shaking my heart...

550
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:40,580
and now you're taking a petty run.

551
00:37:41,470 --> 00:37:45,050
I didn't mean to confuse you, but...

552
00:37:45,050 --> 00:37:48,060
I'm sorry if I did, my friend.

553
00:37:49,370 --> 00:37:51,910
Gosh, this mango is a waste.

554
00:37:51,910 --> 00:37:53,980
Aren't you eating? Should I wrap it up for you?

555
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:58,400
Forget it. Anyhow, I can give up and move on,

556
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:01,210
but I don't know about Da Wool.

557
00:38:01,210 --> 00:38:03,790
Because she's completely fallen for you.

558
00:38:03,790 --> 00:38:07,340
Tell her that first love never works.

559
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:08,750
Just hurry up and move out.

560
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:11,160
The first love discount is over now.

561
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:14,510
- I'm going. 
 - Okay, Landlord. Please take care.

562
00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:20,940
Finally, if there's anything anyone wants to say, you may go ahead.

563
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:23,000
Starting with the plaintiff.

564
00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:37,680
It's true...

565
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:42,270
I still... have affection for the defendant, my wife.

566
00:38:42,270 --> 00:38:45,450
However, I deeply realized that marriage...

567
00:38:45,450 --> 00:38:47,930
isn't just about two people,

568
00:38:47,930 --> 00:38:51,760
but their respective families as well.

569
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:56,600
I hate Moon Hyeok Soo, who hurt me deeply

570
00:38:56,600 --> 00:39:01,300
and insulted my character.

571
00:39:02,330 --> 00:39:04,520
I despise him.

572
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:07,070
How could I become a family with the

573
00:39:07,070 --> 00:39:11,820
daughter of a man I despise and spend the rest of my life with her?

574
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:16,930
Telling me to endure it is too harsh for me.

575
00:39:16,930 --> 00:39:19,550
Please consider my feelings and...

576
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:22,920
I wish you'll help us properly put...

577
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:25,990
an end here for good.

578
00:39:25,990 --> 00:39:28,150
Thank you.

579
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:42,780
   

580
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:52,980
Your Honor and Associate Judges...

581
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:55,900
the core issue of this case is...

582
00:39:55,900 --> 00:40:01,930
the extent of the severe treatment displayed by a direct relative.

583
00:40:01,930 --> 00:40:07,190
The behaviors of Moon Hyeok Soo, the father-in-law, as mentioned here...

584
00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:11,640
are indeed unfair and harsh.

585
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:15,490
But in fact, if you live in Korea as a daughter-in-law,

586
00:40:15,490 --> 00:40:21,560
they could be considered to be due to tradition.

587
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:27,000
Couldn't it be considered especially more unfair and harsh when they're

588
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:31,490
done by a father-in-law to a son-in-law?

589
00:40:31,490 --> 00:40:35,690
For proof, if you look at the Supreme Court's precedents we submitted,

590
00:40:35,690 --> 00:40:39,150
the court disapproved the request,

591
00:40:39,150 --> 00:40:41,560
even when worse verbal and physical abuses existed.

592
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:45,390
Saying the mother-in-law was displaying...

593
00:40:45,390 --> 00:40:48,470
a sincerely remorseful attitude,

594
00:40:48,470 --> 00:40:55,560
the court decided the relationship coul not be unrecoverable or irreversible.

595
00:40:57,930 --> 00:40:59,800
Twenty years ago,

596
00:41:00,890 --> 00:41:03,990
I was part of the said case

597
00:41:03,990 --> 00:41:08,690
and couldn't help but agree to the divorce,

598
00:41:08,690 --> 00:41:12,250
giving up custody and kinship.

599
00:41:12,250 --> 00:41:14,160
As the plaintiff said,

600
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:16,860
marriage isn't just a coming together of individuals,

601
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:19,490
but of the families as well.

602
00:41:19,490 --> 00:41:26,190
However, I don't think the union of families is the essence of marriage.

603
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:32,050
I think the union of two adult individuals who can judge and decide...

604
00:41:32,050 --> 00:41:35,730
on their own is the true essence of marriage.

605
00:41:35,730 --> 00:41:39,190
Your Honor, in married life,

606
00:41:39,190 --> 00:41:44,000
sometimes unexpected unfair, uncomfortable, or laborious things happen.

607
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,450
No, all the time, actually.

608
00:41:46,450 --> 00:41:52,740
I hope you'll teach them a lesson on how two adults, the main entities of marriage,

609
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:56,310
can unite to wisely claim independence from their

610
00:41:56,310 --> 00:41:58,850
respective parents to develop their own household and

611
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:05,150
also how they can grow as they conquer crises together...

612
00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:08,450
with reconciliation instead of separation...

613
00:42:08,450 --> 00:42:12,040
as the judicious answer.

614
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,950
Thank you.

615
00:42:27,550 --> 00:42:29,500
Did we... lose?

616
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:30,950
No.

617
00:42:30,950 --> 00:42:34,360
The judge directly ordered an adjustment,

618
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:36,830
saying she'll give them their last chance.

619
00:42:36,830 --> 00:42:38,730
Whoa, how fortunate.

620
00:42:38,730 --> 00:42:42,960
But are we going to lose if the adjustment fails?

621
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,730
I'm not sure.

622
00:42:44,730 --> 00:42:49,090
Honestly, a divorce is a bit too much compared to previous cases.

623
00:42:49,090 --> 00:42:52,530
But the judge looked like she'll let them divorce.

624
00:42:52,530 --> 00:42:54,720
You'll have to succeed in the adjustment somehow.

625
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:58,230
That's why CEO Hong went to meet her ex-husband right now.

626
00:42:58,230 --> 00:43:00,650
Because he's the key point.

627
00:43:00,650 --> 00:43:04,820
We need to show that the assailant is hugely remorseful and will change...

628
00:43:04,820 --> 00:43:07,010
to the plaintiff and the adjustment committee.

629
00:43:07,010 --> 00:43:09,300
Whoa, how many years has it been?

630
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:12,900
Aren't they meeting for the first time after the divorce?

631
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:14,720
That's true.

632
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:18,070
Gosh, that ex-husband seemed to be something else.

633
00:43:18,070 --> 00:43:21,620
I don't know how she'll convince him.

634
00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:24,520
Isn't that CEO Hong's specialty?

635
00:43:28,790 --> 00:43:31,190
She's pretty much a trainer.

636
00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:36,790
Gosh, forget it!

637
00:43:36,790 --> 00:43:38,580
Just let them divorce.

638
00:43:38,580 --> 00:43:42,280
Goodness, how dare a woman who ran away more than 20 years ago

639
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:44,770
try to act like a mother now?

640
00:43:44,770 --> 00:43:48,150
A woman who abandoned three daughters. How improper.

641
00:43:48,150 --> 00:43:50,260
Do you know how much I was against that marriage?

642
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:53,190
If a man is poor and doesn't have a good job,

643
00:43:53,190 --> 00:43:55,060
he's full of an inferior complex!

644
00:43:55,060 --> 00:43:57,510
See? I'm pretty much a prophet.

645
00:43:57,510 --> 00:44:00,280
As good as a prophet! Gosh.

646
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:04,010
Let them divorce, and don't say more.

647
00:44:04,010 --> 00:44:06,580
There are plenty of guys who are more sensible

648
00:44:06,580 --> 00:44:09,460
and better than a punk like him.

649
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:13,250
Such an arrogant punk who doesn't even know his place. Goodness!

650
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:18,160
Gosh, Sae Na also lacks good judgment...

651
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:20,420
because she's like her mom!

652
00:44:24,220 --> 00:44:25,590
   

653
00:44:46,410 --> 00:44:48,840
Where the heck are we going?

654
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:51,690
Let's just die together.

655
00:44:52,230 --> 00:44:54,560
Gosh, what now, woman?

656
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:01,160
When I left that house 20 years ago...

657
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:04,400
do you know what belief I had?

658
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:09,330
"No matter how lowly and childish your mother is,

659
00:45:09,330 --> 00:45:12,420
you'd still raise the kids right.

660
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:16,150
Since they're her kids and blood-related."

661
00:45:16,150 --> 00:45:18,750
- Hey, you have no say— 
 - However...

662
00:45:19,610 --> 00:45:22,150
I misjudged.

663
00:45:22,150 --> 00:45:26,410
What a child needs to grow up properly isn't money, but...

664
00:45:26,410 --> 00:45:31,520
a helper, who has the right mind, to help her acquire the correct

665
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:35,220
intelligence to live through this harsh world.

666
00:45:35,220 --> 00:45:36,500
I didn't know it back then.

667
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:39,160
What are you saying, you crazy woman?

668
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:43,800
- What a... 
 - Do you... even know what love is?

669
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:48,420
Do you even know what dignity of character is...

670
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:52,300
and what parenting attitudes and principles mean?

671
00:45:53,010 --> 00:45:58,350
Entrusting those young children into the hands of an immature person like you...

672
00:46:00,050 --> 00:46:03,540
How hopeless must she have been to come to me?

673
00:46:18,690 --> 00:46:21,020
How far are you going?

674
00:46:32,090 --> 00:46:37,280
I know... you're not someone I can talk to.

675
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:41,480
The only way to atone for my past sins now is...

676
00:46:42,510 --> 00:46:47,810
to probably drown... in the ocean with you.

677
00:46:49,870 --> 00:46:52,880
What? What are you saying right—

678
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:59,370
Are you crazy?

679
00:47:01,350 --> 00:47:03,460
You didn't know?

680
00:47:03,460 --> 00:47:08,680
That I already went mad 20 years ago while going through...

681
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:10,340
that wicked divorce lawsuit?

682
00:47:10,340 --> 00:47:11,890
Wait—

683
00:47:12,670 --> 00:47:18,710
Unless you're going to sign the agreement not to interfere or engage in the

684
00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:21,500
kids' married life from now on...

685
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:25,800
just die with me right here and now.

686
00:47:29,450 --> 00:47:30,950
Hey, stop the car...

687
00:47:30,950 --> 00:47:33,100
Stop. Why are you doing this? Stop!

688
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:35,880
Stop the car! I said to stop!

689
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:37,550
Hey, hey! Stop the car!

690
00:47:37,550 --> 00:47:41,510
Stop! Stop now! Stop!

691
00:47:54,660 --> 00:47:59,480
   

692
00:48:03,910 --> 00:48:07,470
Dad really agreed to this?

693
00:48:07,470 --> 00:48:09,440
Yes.

694
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:13,070
He wouldn't con you when your mom's a lawyer.

695
00:48:13,070 --> 00:48:15,820
That is indeed your dad's fingerprint.

696
00:48:17,260 --> 00:48:20,180
Take it and go meet Seung Hwa first.

697
00:48:20,180 --> 00:48:22,380
Convince him as much as you can

698
00:48:22,380 --> 00:48:25,370
before we enter adjustment.

699
00:48:25,370 --> 00:48:27,170
I need to?

700
00:48:27,170 --> 00:48:31,580
Once the adjustment is set, we can't appeal. It's the end.

701
00:48:31,580 --> 00:48:37,400
So, we must do all we can before writing the adjustment record.

702
00:48:38,230 --> 00:48:41,900
Can't you meet him and tell him in my place?

703
00:48:43,450 --> 00:48:45,050
Sae Na...

704
00:48:45,050 --> 00:48:50,430
parents... are people in the passenger seat.

705
00:48:50,430 --> 00:48:52,780
You're the driver of your life.

706
00:48:52,780 --> 00:48:55,810
Regardless of how I got off in the middle...

707
00:48:55,810 --> 00:49:00,720
or how loud and distracting your dad gets next to you...

708
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:05,610
you need to hold on to the steering wheel and get to your wanted

709
00:49:05,610 --> 00:49:08,120
destination with your strength.

710
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:11,200
With my strength?

711
00:49:15,290 --> 00:49:17,890
Honestly, all we can do for you...

712
00:49:17,890 --> 00:49:21,580
is talk to you, so you're not bored and

713
00:49:21,580 --> 00:49:25,490
feed you tasty food, so you're not hungry.

714
00:49:25,490 --> 00:49:27,410
That's it.

715
00:49:30,630 --> 00:49:32,490
But...

716
00:49:33,690 --> 00:49:36,460
I don't even have a license, Mom.

717
00:49:37,190 --> 00:49:40,670
You can get one. It's easy.

718
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:50,940
I...

719
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:54,030
will teach you.

720
00:49:55,310 --> 00:49:57,130
Although...

721
00:49:57,870 --> 00:49:59,810
it's quite late.

722
00:50:24,350 --> 00:50:26,320
Yes, Dad?

723
00:50:27,150 --> 00:50:30,080
Oh, you're busy?

724
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:34,340
No. It's nothing serious.

725
00:50:34,340 --> 00:50:36,610
I just missed you.

726
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:42,550
All right, I'll call you later.

727
00:50:42,550 --> 00:50:46,140
Okay, I love you.

728
00:50:46,140 --> 00:50:47,800
Bye!

729
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:55,200
My dad taught me how to drive for my license.

730
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:57,670
That's out of the blue.

731
00:50:58,530 --> 00:51:01,560
Is Father unwell?

732
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:03,340
No.

733
00:51:03,340 --> 00:51:10,090
I just felt so sorry and affectionate for CEO Hong and her daughter.

734
00:51:10,090 --> 00:51:13,360
It just made me miss Mom and Dad.

735
00:51:14,740 --> 00:51:18,990
What about you? Still in a cold war with your mother?

736
00:51:22,090 --> 00:51:23,990
How many years has it been?

737
00:51:23,990 --> 00:51:25,730
Whatever.

738
00:51:27,420 --> 00:51:30,870
Anyway, did you make up with Jae Gyeom?

739
00:51:30,870 --> 00:51:33,470
Are you two still in a cold war?

740
00:51:33,470 --> 00:51:35,070
Me?

741
00:51:35,070 --> 00:51:38,710
Hey, you think I'm like you?

742
00:51:38,710 --> 00:51:41,620
I made up with him that day.

743
00:51:48,300 --> 00:51:50,320
Okay, please call me.

744
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:51,850
Okay, take care.

745
00:51:51,850 --> 00:51:54,190
- Thank you for everything. 
 - Sure.

746
00:51:58,940 --> 00:52:00,040
Hey, Jae Gyeom.

747
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:01,480
 Where are you? 

748
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:03,050
 Did you get home? 

749
00:52:03,050 --> 00:52:05,110
No...

750
00:52:05,110 --> 00:52:07,860
I got into a small accident on the way home.

751
00:52:07,860 --> 00:52:11,490
 How? I mean, are you hurt anywhere? 

752
00:52:11,490 --> 00:52:13,430
 Are you all right? 

753
00:52:13,430 --> 00:52:16,170
I'm not hurt. Don't worry.

754
00:52:16,170 --> 00:52:18,120
I called the insurance company, too.

755
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:20,330
 Where are you? I'll be right there. 

756
00:52:23,420 --> 00:52:25,850
No, it's okay.

757
00:52:25,850 --> 00:52:27,060
There's no need.

758
00:52:27,060 --> 00:52:29,350
 Text me the address. I'll be right there. 

759
00:52:29,350 --> 00:52:30,730
Wait—

760
00:52:33,910 --> 00:52:36,960
All right. Okay.

761
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:41,730
 He raced right over to fix my car and even paid for the repair costs. 

762
00:52:42,750 --> 00:52:49,870
So I again explained the issue regarding his mother so he could understand.

763
00:52:49,870 --> 00:52:51,110
What can he do?

764
00:52:51,110 --> 00:52:54,240
He's never been in my shoes, so he might not know.

765
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:58,260
I need to thoroughly explain it to him with great patience.

766
00:52:58,260 --> 00:53:00,030
Right.

767
00:53:00,030 --> 00:53:01,810
How incredible of you.

768
00:53:04,580 --> 00:53:08,770
What about you? Is it going well with Seo Hee?

769
00:53:08,770 --> 00:53:11,260
What do you mean? It's not like that.

770
00:53:11,260 --> 00:53:13,700
As if it's not like that.

771
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:19,330
Hye Min said she saw you at a restaurant.

772
00:53:19,330 --> 00:53:21,890
Eating with Ki Seo Hee and her kid.

773
00:53:21,890 --> 00:53:25,200
Oh, that was for Da Wool's birthday.

774
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:29,570
Isn't Ki Seo Hee the rumored divorced single who's making passes at you?

775
00:53:29,570 --> 00:53:31,550
The one Kwon Si Wook spoke of.

776
00:53:32,990 --> 00:53:36,660
Seo Hee just took a stab at me out of loneliness.

777
00:53:36,660 --> 00:53:39,050
She wasn't being serious.

778
00:53:39,050 --> 00:53:42,290
But I didn't agree, so I turned her down. Don't misunderstand.

779
00:53:42,290 --> 00:53:44,700
Like I care.

780
00:53:45,210 --> 00:53:47,850
Hey, then, won't it be awkward?

781
00:53:47,850 --> 00:53:50,920
Is it okay to continue living there?

782
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:53,130
I'll have to move soon.

783
00:53:53,130 --> 00:53:54,760
Where will you go?

784
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:56,680
Did you look into a house?

785
00:53:56,680 --> 00:53:59,350
I'm thinking of moving to Gyeonggi-do.

786
00:53:59,350 --> 00:54:01,510
This neighborhood is too expensive.

787
00:54:01,510 --> 00:54:04,170
Hey, just make up with your mother.

788
00:54:04,170 --> 00:54:06,260
Stop acting like a fool.

789
00:54:06,260 --> 00:54:10,380
"Getting a divorce was my mistake. It was stupid of me.

790
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:12,920
But what can I do? The deed is done.

791
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:17,260
From now on, I'll heed your words and avoid acting foolish.

792
00:54:17,260 --> 00:54:19,680
I'll put my head on straight and live diligently!"

793
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:22,700
You think your mom would refuse an apology like that?

794
00:54:22,700 --> 00:54:24,440
Thanks for the advice.

795
00:54:25,180 --> 00:54:27,600
I'll take care of my own business.

796
00:54:36,190 --> 00:54:37,960
Who on earth...

797
00:54:38,570 --> 00:54:41,210
will you give up your passenger seat to?

798
00:54:41,210 --> 00:54:43,630
You don't like me, you don't like Seo Hee.

799
00:54:43,630 --> 00:54:45,540
And you don't like any of your family.

800
00:54:45,540 --> 00:54:48,500
Are you planning to race to the ends of the earth alone?

801
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:54,300
You ought to fall asleep and get into a big crash to come to your senses.

802
00:54:59,140 --> 00:55:00,640
Look at her...

803
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:03,180
Curse me, why don't you?

804
00:55:04,150 --> 00:55:06,180
Seriously.

805
00:55:07,670 --> 00:55:09,980
She never cleans up after herself.

806
00:55:09,980 --> 00:55:11,930
I always have to clean it up.

807
00:55:14,980 --> 00:55:19,560
He packed him lunches every day to show he had changed for the better.

808
00:55:19,560 --> 00:55:21,590
When he couldn't cook at all.

809
00:55:21,590 --> 00:55:25,390
The adjustment's been set on not divorcing, then, right?

810
00:55:25,390 --> 00:55:26,900
Yeah.

811
00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:31,380
But it's only confirmed if your son-in-law doesn't object within the time period.

812
00:55:31,380 --> 00:55:33,370
He wouldn't object, would he?

813
00:55:33,370 --> 00:55:37,180
Well, the father did open his treasury.

814
00:55:37,180 --> 00:55:42,190
In my opinion, the father's the only one who'd go, "This doesn't count. I'm calling it off!"

815
00:55:42,190 --> 00:55:45,600
He can't even object to that agreement. It's a finished game.

816
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:51,000
In addition, if he changes his mind, CEO Hong will probably go to him in her car again.

817
00:55:51,570 --> 00:55:55,410
He'll have a seizure just from CEO Hong's car now.

818
00:55:55,410 --> 00:55:58,990
Sae Na needs to go herself. She's getting her license soon.

819
00:55:58,990 --> 00:56:04,000
Goodness, are you planning to teach your threatening skills to your daughter now?

820
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,250
Isn't that the essence?

821
00:56:10,590 --> 00:56:12,340
By the way, where's Attorney Goo?

822
00:56:12,340 --> 00:56:13,640
He didn't have any trials today.

823
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:15,800
Oh, he went to the hospital.

824
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:18,550
A wellness checkup for his mother?

825
00:56:18,550 --> 00:56:19,870
Mother...

826
00:56:19,870 --> 00:56:22,460
- His mother? 
 - Yes.

827
00:56:22,460 --> 00:56:25,710
Who knows? I guess he's going to make up with his mother.

828
00:56:25,710 --> 00:56:27,150
I don't know.

829
00:56:38,110 --> 00:56:40,310
   

830
00:56:48,270 --> 00:56:50,150
   

831
00:56:50,770 --> 00:56:52,650
Yes, you're doing great.

832
00:56:52,650 --> 00:56:54,490
Just go straight like this.

833
00:56:55,570 --> 00:56:57,200
Just like that.

834
00:57:21,660 --> 00:57:24,670
I guess you just couldn't hold out any more?

835
00:57:24,670 --> 00:57:26,670
Yes.

836
00:57:26,670 --> 00:57:28,650
I missed you so much, Mom.

837
00:57:28,650 --> 00:57:31,230
I couldn't hold it in anymore.

838
00:57:31,930 --> 00:57:35,420
You missed the money, not your mom.

839
00:57:35,420 --> 00:57:38,080
That's an option.

840
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:40,330
How great is it for your son to come with you to the hospital?

841
00:57:40,330 --> 00:57:42,640
Or you'd have to go alone.

842
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:45,080
You need to get an endoscopy, too.

843
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:48,640
Did I tell you to come? You came on your own.

844
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:50,980
Oh, my! Hey—

845
00:57:50,980 --> 00:57:53,860
E-Eun Beom, what's this?

846
00:57:53,860 --> 00:57:55,540
There's the...

847
00:57:56,890 --> 00:57:59,760
This is a flooded car, so lie back for a little.

848
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:01,870
I'll get you back up when we're at a stop.

849
00:58:01,870 --> 00:58:04,540
Or would you like to go all the way to the hospital like this?

850
00:58:04,540 --> 00:58:06,520
If that's more comfortable.

851
00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:11,420
Just stay down. It'll fall back again anyway.

852
00:58:11,420 --> 00:58:12,800
My goodness.

853
00:58:24,290 --> 00:58:25,580
Let's go.

854
00:58:25,580 --> 00:58:28,400
Okay. Let's go.

855
00:58:31,650 --> 00:58:33,590
Yes.

856
00:58:33,590 --> 00:58:36,690
 Seon Myeong Hwa's guardian, please come in. 

857
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:57,410
Mom, are you awake now?

858
00:59:02,170 --> 00:59:04,290
Eun Byeol...

859
00:59:04,290 --> 00:59:05,660
What?

860
00:59:05,660 --> 00:59:08,450
I dreamed about Eun Byeol.

861
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:12,510
Is it because her memorial day is coming up?

862
00:59:29,580 --> 00:59:32,050
Please mind what you eat.

863
00:59:32,050 --> 00:59:35,590
Isn't it unfair to go see Eun Byeol already when you're so rich?

864
00:59:35,590 --> 00:59:38,080
- Spend all that money— 
 - Don't worry.

865
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:41,640
Even if I die early, I'm not leaving you a penny.

866
00:59:41,640 --> 00:59:43,640
I told you, didn't I?

867
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:47,360
Don't even dream about it until you remarry.

868
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:04,970
Did you wear those shoes on purpose?

869
01:00:04,970 --> 01:00:06,630
To induce sympathy?

870
01:00:06,630 --> 01:00:08,090
Of course.

871
01:00:08,090 --> 01:00:11,020
Okay, those shoes are really an eyesore.

872
01:00:11,020 --> 01:00:13,940
Your plan worked completely.

873
01:00:13,940 --> 01:00:16,530
Stop by the department store later. It's right next to here.

874
01:00:16,530 --> 01:00:19,830
Goodness, what's the occasion? You never spend a penny.

875
01:00:19,830 --> 01:00:21,450
Just take it all with you.

876
01:00:21,450 --> 01:00:24,910
You'll get sick if you act out of the ordinary.

877
01:00:35,930 --> 01:00:37,580
Why?

878
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:44,070
Wait...

879
01:00:52,450 --> 01:00:54,320
One second.

880
01:01:02,430 --> 01:01:04,670
   

881
01:01:06,280 --> 01:01:07,930
Mom...

882
01:01:10,340 --> 01:01:12,650
Please go to the department store alone.

883
01:01:22,430 --> 01:01:24,340
Hello?

884
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:41,320


885
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:43,950
 He's a lost cause. 

886
01:01:43,950 --> 01:01:45,060
 Divorcing isn't an option. 

887
01:01:45,060 --> 01:01:46,560
 Only if you'll look the other way... 

888
01:01:46,560 --> 01:01:50,510
 But not estranged enough to leave her ignorant like a fool. 

889
01:01:50,510 --> 01:01:53,510
 It seems the lady came to meet Ha Ra.  
 -  Is that true? 

890
01:01:53,510 --> 01:01:55,120
 I don't have a talent for fooling Ha Ra. 

891
01:01:55,120 --> 01:01:58,010
 Why are you looking at me so lost in thought? 

892
01:01:58,010 --> 01:01:59,450
 Just say it. What are we? 

893
01:01:59,450 --> 01:02:01,700
 This is why I'm not dating you. 

894
01:02:01,700 --> 01:02:04,720
 Who am I to be worried about you? 

895
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:06,950
 Why are you worried about me? 

896
01:02:06,950 --> 01:02:10,150
 You think I'm too good to throw away now? 

897
01:02:10,150 --> 01:02:13,540
