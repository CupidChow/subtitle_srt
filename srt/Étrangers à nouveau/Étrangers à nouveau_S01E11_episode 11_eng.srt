1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:08,050


2
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:12,300
   

3
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:14,600
   

4
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:37,070
   

5
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:41,750
   

6
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,120
   

7
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:46,000
Yes.

8
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:50,640
Yes, I can talk.

9
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,970
Yes.

10
00:00:57,850 --> 00:00:59,540
What?

11
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:03,720
How did you find out, Mom—

12
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:07,200
Don't worry. I'll take care of it.

13
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:09,910
I'm going to convince him.

14
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:12,190
I said I'll take care of it!

15
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:14,540
I don't intend to give up, either.

16
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:16,010
Yes.

17
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:17,720
Don't worry, Mom.

18
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:21,970
I'll try convincing him, and if it doesn't work out...

19
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:24,440
I'll wrap things up myself.

20
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:28,160
 If you're sorry, break up right now. That will be enough. 

21
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,760
 Promise me before you go. 

22
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:33,060
 That you'll break up right away with Ha Ra today. 

23
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:39,040
 I knew it. Bi Chwi was asking if something was wrong with you two. 

24
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:43,990
Okay. Okay, I promise.

25
00:01:54,320 --> 00:02:00,260
How can you lend your name to that failure, even if he's your dad?

26
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:06,070
You're more or less a public figure since you've been on TV.

27
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:12,910
Did you think renting business was easy money?

28
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:15,540
There are so many weird tenants.

29
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:20,250
 If that tenant doesn't pay the rent by this month, just sell it off.  Do you understand? 

30
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:22,850
Okay, I'll do that.

31
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:26,250
I'm going to take care of it by the end of next month.

32
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:29,990
Okay, okay. Okay, take care.

33
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:03,010
 (Why?) 

34
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:24,500
   

35
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:29,110
♫  Congratulations, congratulations!  ♫

36
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:33,330
♫  Congratulations on your win!  ♫

37
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:36,930
♫  Congratulations, congratulations!  ♫`

38
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:42,010
- ♫  Congratulations on your win!  ♫ 
 - ♫  Congratulations on your pregnancy!  ♫

39
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:47,510
What are you doing? Blow out the candles.

40
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:49,140
Wait! Let's take pictures.

41
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:50,870
Take one for us, Attorney Oh, since you're in the middle.

42
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:52,460
Shall we do that?

43
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:54,170
One moment, please.

44
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:56,980
All right, blow it on the count of three.

45
00:03:56,980 --> 00:04:01,280
- One, two, three! 
 -  Two, three! 

46
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:31,060
CEO Hong, have the tail.

47
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:35,810
How could she be... flirting with...

48
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:43,240
another man while I was doing the lawsuit for her...

49
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:48,110
enduring all the shame, insult, and anguish?

50
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:49,330
Does that make sense?

51
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:52,580
Does this plot make sense?

52
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:01,790
Are you having fun drinking that?

53
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:03,130
Huh?

54
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:07,130
I can't drink even a sip of alcohol with all this food in front of me.

55
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:09,070
Yet you can drink?

56
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:11,550
- Is it delicious? 
 - No.

57
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:12,990
What do you mean, "no"?

58
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:15,790
Saying it's great and all...

59
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:20,010
We chose the wrong date and the wrong place, didn't we?

60
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:22,640
Whose fault is it for me to go through this?

61
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:27,600
Next time, let's go to an Italian restaurant where we don't have to drink.

62
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,580
At least until Attorney Kang gives birth.

63
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:36,550
Also... people who were recently dumped...

64
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,450
Let's leave them out for a while.

65
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:42,140
- Yes. 
 - Shit...

66
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:43,230
 S-Say ah. 

67
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:44,750
 I said I don't want it! 

68
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:47,230
Hey, New Bride!

69
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:49,470
Y-You're not going to drink that, right?

70
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:50,450
Let me have it.

71
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:52,740
Don't call me that, CEO Seo.

72
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:54,620
All right.

73
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:57,090
Hurry up and give it to me. Give it.

74
00:05:57,090 --> 00:06:01,300
I'll give it to you if you address me correctly.

75
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:04,280
Bride-To-Be!

76
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,160
Hurry up and give it.

77
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:11,580
I'm not joking.

78
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,360
New Bride or Bride-To-Be...

79
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,570
Don't be calling me like that, seriously!

80
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:18,830
- Seriously? 
 - Yes!

81
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:22,370
Why do you keep doing it when I say I don't like it?

82
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:24,950
Is he fucking looking down on me or something?

83
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:26,720
Wait. Let go.

84
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,280
I said let go of me!

85
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Did you just say, "fucking looking down"?

86
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,810
"Fucking looking down"?

87
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:37,560
Hey! Do you not regret your word choice?

88
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,050
Wh-Why would I regret—

89
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:40,620
- C-Come on— 
 - Let go!

90
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:42,080
Was there something wrong with what I said?

91
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,500
- Hey, Attorney Kang! 
 - What?

92
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:46,390
Are you looking down on me because I was dumped?

93
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:49,230
You're the one fucking looking down on me!

94
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:50,720
What the heck?

95
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,480
When did I look down on you for getting dumped?

96
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:58,080
Wait! CEO Seo, you looked down on me first!

97
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:12,000
This is too funny.

98
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,030
Isn't it funny?

99
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:17,790
Come on.

100
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:21,100
This was a so-called congratulatory party for his win and her pregnancy.

101
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:25,390
So everyone's hanging in here with dead fish eyes and

102
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:29,050
yawning every second, although we're exhausted.

103
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:34,620
But they themselves complained all night and messed up the mood.

104
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:40,160
Now, they even want to show us a dogfight as the finale.

105
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:44,450
This is too funny for me.

106
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:50,320
Isn't the fact that humans can be this selfish and childish,

107
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,650
so cute and funny?

108
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:56,330
Is it only me? CEO Hong, is it only me who finds it cute?

109
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,250
It's cute only to me, huh?

110
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:04,840
Is that why I want to just crash everything and

111
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:07,890
bring forth a grand dogfight by the collar?

112
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:12,460
All right, let's call it a day here.

113
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:14,920
Congratulations on your win and pregnancy.

114
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:17,200
Good work, everyone. Fill up your glasses now.

115
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,800
Let's go. Goodness, thank you.

116
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,930
All right, great job!

117
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:25,150
 Great job! 

118
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,900
- Please charge this card. 
 - Okay.

119
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:38,130
Whoa, I think I have indigestion.

120
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:40,970
Gosh, I'm about to puke.

121
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:43,950
- Oh, please give me the receipt. 
 - Okay.

122
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:47,430
 Where are you? Do you want to go home together? 

123
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:50,370
Whoa, I'm so tired.

124
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,610
Gosh, I'm so sleepy.

125
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:55,600
- Please take care, CEO Hong. 
 - See you tomorrow.

126
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,220
Okay!

127
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:04,910
- Everyone went home now, right? 
 - Yes.

128
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:07,990
You'll grab a taxi, too, right, Attorney Oh?

129
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:10,150
Well, I have to stop by somewhere.

130
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:13,560
- Please go on ahead without me. 
 - Oh, okay.

131
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:17,250
It's here. Guys, hurry! The cab is here.

132
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:19,480
 I'm on my way home already. 

133
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,360
 See you tomorrow. 

134
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:48,550
- Hello? 
 -  Yes, hello? 

135
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:50,230
Where are you?

136
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:52,430
Why did you leave first?

137
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,310
 Hello? 

138
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:57,910
- Yes. 
 -  I asked you a question. 

139
00:09:57,910 --> 00:10:01,430
You could've let me know. I thought we were going together.

140
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:03,620
I just wasn't feeling it.

141
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:06,110
 Did something unpleasant happen to you today? 

142
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:08,270
You seemed okay until lunch earlier.

143
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:10,470
Why are you doing this suddenly?

144
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:13,000
 Hello. 

145
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,580
Yes.

146
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,880
 Why aren't you saying anything? 

147
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,640
 I'm asking why you're bent out of shape again. 

148
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:22,050
What do you mean why?

149
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:26,610
You know I'm always fickle like I have bipolar disorder. Just let it be.

150
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:28,280
What?

151
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:36,320
Gosh, did he eat twisted donuts with the alcohol?

152
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:40,030
Hey, why are you throwing shade at me after getting cynical on your own?

153
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:42,140
You get cynical on your own,

154
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:44,360
then you're sarcastic with me when I'm clueless.

155
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,950
 You don't even tell me when I ask you why. 

156
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:49,550
 Why do you ruin my mood, too? 

157
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:55,530
Today's company dinner was also uneasy for me... in many ways.

158
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:58,060
You don't even know anything.

159
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:00,990
Forget it.

160
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:03,880
 Let's stop talking. Hang up. 

161
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:07,410
Think about it again,

162
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:09,570
and if you feel like apologizing...

163
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:12,330
leave me a text or whatever.

164
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:42,740
What's this? I told you to leave me a text.

165
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:44,650
Ha Ra...

166
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:55,310
I thought it'd be better to tell you this in person.

167
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:01,720
Let's end things here.

168
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:04,110
Let's wrap it up.

169
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:16,670
Why?

170
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:20,770
You don't want to give up having kids.

171
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:26,430
That's... it?

172
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:32,050
I know you weren't happy during today's company dinner.

173
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:35,140
Since we were all congratulating Senior Kang's sudden pregnancy...

174
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:38,920
putting candles on a cake and all of that...

175
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:41,350
You were feeling uneasy.

176
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:43,250
And jealous.

177
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:47,110
In the meantime, your mother is telling you to break up with me.

178
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:51,540
- What do you— 
 - You must've been thinking about breaking up with me, too.

179
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:55,050
In the end, the issue is about who will be the bad guy.

180
00:12:56,090 --> 00:12:58,170
I'll just take that role.

181
00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:00,270
It has been my specialty.

182
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:01,700
- I'm really— 
 - It's okay.

183
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:03,680
It's okay and...

184
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,710
No one did anything wrong, and there's no victim or offender.

185
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:12,600
Our ideologies and values just didn't match. Right?

186
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,340
I won't resent you, so don't resent me, either.

187
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:16,910
Well...

188
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:20,250
you probably wouldn't anyway.

189
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:26,290
You're actually... thankful to me... aren't you?

190
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,450
Yeah.

191
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:33,170
I'm really...

192
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,190
so thankful.

193
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:41,380
For not...

194
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:46,250
letting me get stuck with a nutcase like you...

195
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:50,610
I'm so, so thankful.

196
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:04,150
Go. Don't just watch me.

197
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:11,250
I said, get lost!

198
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:19,240
♫  With small lips that whispered eternity  ♫

199
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:25,190
♫  At those harsh words I spit out  ♫

200
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:34,600
♫  I'm afraid all the memories of the past will fade  ♫

201
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:39,320
 If I didn't tell him to get lost, would he not have gone? 

202
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:42,420
 Wait, no. 

203
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:45,450
 The twisted donut must've been the problem. 

204
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:49,510
 I shouldn't have said the twisted donut part. 

205
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:54,740
♫  By your side  ♫

206
00:14:54,740 --> 00:15:00,160
 Could it have decisively hurt his pride when I just hung up on him, 

207
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,660
 saying I don't want to talk? 

208
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:07,040
♫  Put in it, dazzling  ♫

209
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,320
 That's possible since he has a strong pride. 

210
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,420
♫  See you and me  ♫

211
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:17,090
 You must've been thinking about breaking up with me, too. 

212
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:20,460
 In the end, the issue is about who will be the bad guy. 

213
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:23,830
 I'll just take that role. 

214
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:27,910
♫  We at that time  ♫

215
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:32,530
 Why did he escalate the situation that much just for getting mad at him? 

216
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:34,810
 Is this really the end? 

217
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:37,110
 So meaninglessly? 

218
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:47,380
 We got back after breaking up so many times. 

219
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:50,340
 Some breakups were part of a fight... 

220
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:54,590
 and some others were complete ends. 

221
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:59,790
 Today's thing... Is it part of a fight... 

222
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:04,300
 or... is this really the end? 

223
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:11,900
♫  I will send you, in the last hours  ♫

224
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:17,850
♫  I'll say hello, then  ♫

225
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:20,330
 Hey, I'm going to give up on this guy. 

226
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:24,570
♫  Goodbye  ♫

227
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:40,620
 Well, we had a small quarrel, but... we made up quickly. 

228
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:42,460
What the heck?

229
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:44,980
I thought something had happened when I saw your text.

230
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:48,510
Well... Did you sleep early last night?

231
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:49,470
Yes.

232
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:51,320
 Were you with Goo? 

233
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,220
N-No.

234
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:59,270
 Why was Goo so unhappy last night? Did something happen? 

235
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:01,090
Well...

236
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:05,750
He said something happened.

237
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:11,740
He said he was already upset and rammed you and CEO Seo for annoying him.

238
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:16,010
You know how it is. He goes off the rails sometimes when he's upset.

239
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:18,020
Don't worry about it.

240
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:22,290
Objective speaking, he's the weirdest one in our office.

241
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:24,180
Isn't he?

242
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:27,550
But you're even weirder for liking that weird guy.

243
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:29,220
Do you agree?

244
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:33,580
 Oh, my client's here. See you later. 

245
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:09,750
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

246
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:11,360
Hey, hurry up and call the insurance.

247
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,250
Be quiet and stay put.

248
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:15,390
By chance, are you going to call your insurance?

249
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:18,290
Of course. Wouldn't I?

250
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:20,650
Oh, well...

251
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:27,740
A buddy I know runs a great auto repair shop.

252
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:30,530
Could you allow me to get it fixed there?

253
00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:33,800
Hey. Are you talking about Min Seong?

254
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:36,930
Oh, be quiet. Please just stay put!

255
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:40,260
Hey! You still keep in touch with that guy?

256
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:43,590
I clearly said it's over for us if you contact him one more time, didn't I?

257
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:45,980
- I need go— 
 - Just shut up!

258
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:49,680
Now is not the time for this!

259
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,360
What?

260
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:56,760
Hey, forget it. Let's just get a divorce.

261
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:59,320
What the hell do you think of me?

262
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:02,110
Get a divorce. Fuck this!

263
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:08,310
Hey, let's get a divorce. Sure! Get a divorce!

264
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:29,370
I-I'm sorry.

265
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:35,460
So, you got a case in the middle of that?

266
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:38,500
Yes. I gave him my card for the insurance.

267
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:42,420
Since it says divorce lawyer, he was asking me this and that.

268
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:45,100
So I just told him to come to the office.

269
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,050
Whoa, that's really absurd.

270
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:49,480
Having to do a divorce consulting for the other party...

271
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:52,720
But do you know what's really absurd?

272
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:56,650
He said... this is their third divorce.

273
00:19:56,650 --> 00:19:59,920
At what age did you get married?

274
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,510
You seem really young.

275
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:05,820
- When I was 21. 
 - I see.

276
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:07,500
Your wife is the same age?

277
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:08,710
Yes.

278
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:11,030
We met at work.

279
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:18,780
Well, then, when was your first divorce?

280
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:22,440
When I was 22 years old.

281
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:26,700
That means you got divorced after a year of getting married.

282
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,800
Why?

283
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:32,300
Well, she cheated on me while I was in the army.

284
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:37,690
I came close to almost killing her, then.

285
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:49,420
Then how did you...get back together with her?

286
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:52,200
It just happened that way.

287
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,200
Since I was divorced...

288
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,390
it wasn't easy to find someone else.

289
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:59,480
And how do I put this?

290
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:02,740
When you're apart, you don't really get into fights.

291
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:06,640
You only remember the good stuff...

292
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:10,520
and it feels like there's no one as good as her.

293
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,990
That's what happened.

294
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:17,470
I'm also most comfortable with her.

295
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:20,850
That's actually the biggest reason.

296
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:22,730
That's true.

297
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,100
I understand.

298
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:29,690
All right, then...

299
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:35,240
When did the... second divorce happen?

300
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:37,910
That was...

301
00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:42,280
Well, let me see... When was it? Well...

302
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:45,810
Oh, that's when I was 25 years old.

303
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:52,300
How long did it last the second time until you got divorced?

304
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:54,960
We lived together for quite a while at that time.

305
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,140
A little more than two years.

306
00:21:57,140 --> 00:22:02,200
I see. What happened this time, then?

307
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:06,620
Well, we got into a fight because she found out I lied.

308
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:09,220
What kind of a lie?

309
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:14,740
I went somewhere I shouldn't go to...

310
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:20,300
with a close buddy of mine and got caught.

311
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:25,370
Somewhere you shouldn't go?

312
00:22:25,370 --> 00:22:29,410
His wife went to a gynecologist for a checkup...

313
00:22:29,410 --> 00:22:30,760
and they found bacteria.

314
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,720
 Whoa... 

315
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:33,900
How could he?

316
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:37,470
Anyhow, he barely got his wife's forgiveness by begging

317
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:40,550
and blaming his close buddy for convincing him to go.

318
00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:44,790
But under the condition of cutting ties with that buddy.

319
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:48,450
I see. But he got caught because of the car accident, huh?

320
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:51,370
Well, anyhow, you can't change what happened in the past.

321
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:53,800
So is the husband saying he doesn't want to divorce?

322
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,590
- Does he want you to stop it? 
 - No.

323
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:58,100
The husband also wants a divorce.

324
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:01,380
They fought too often and saw each other's lows.

325
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:05,020
They've lost all affection for each other.

326
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:09,100
Wait!  He can just file one by agreement. Why would he come to us?

327
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:11,120
Because they can't agree on custody.

328
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,640
What?

329
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,760
Wait!  They have a kid, too?

330
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:20,260
They married when they were young because they got pregnant.

331
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:21,910
Whoa, they're all over the place.

332
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:24,860
So it's a child custody case, right? Are there any other issues?

333
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:29,160
No, there isn't. They just need to agree on custody.

334
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:31,180
But I don't think it'll be easy.

335
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:34,760
Do they both want custody?

336
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:37,360
Who took the child in their last divorce?

337
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,770
The mother did.

338
00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:41,350
However, she doesn't want to this time.

339
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:42,940
Then the father could take the child.

340
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:46,500
The father doesn't want to raise the child, either.

341
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:52,670
So, it's not that they're trying to take the child.

342
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:56,250
They can't come to an agreement because they're tossing the child on the other.

343
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:59,880
That's so irresponsible, getting pregnant before marrying.

344
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,720
What did the child do wrong?

345
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:04,510
Gosh, that poor thing.

346
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:10,050
I don't think it's a matter of getting pregnant before marrying.

347
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:13,620
Shouldn't we end it by saying they're irresponsible parents?

348
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:18,730
You're embarrassing a similar baby-out-of-wedlock couple here.

349
00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:20,980
Oh, my. My goodness, I'm sorry.

350
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:22,820
Oh, my goodness. I ran my mouth without thinking.

351
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:25,700
Gosh, it's okay. I'm completely fine.

352
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:27,590
Not at all.

353
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:33,290
Wh-What's this?

354
00:24:33,290 --> 00:24:36,380
Wow, you're so good at origami.

355
00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:43,970
Why would she blame having baby-out-of-wedlock?

356
00:24:43,970 --> 00:24:45,150
Isn't she so ridiculous?

357
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:48,550
It was just a slip of the tongue. It wasn't intentional.

358
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:51,780
But Kwon Si Wook is also ridiculous.

359
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:55,090
What does he mean it's okay? Didn't he see my face?

360
00:24:55,090 --> 00:24:57,680
It's all good as long as you live happily ever after.

361
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:00,630
Why be so sensitive about everything?

362
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:03,400
Feel better. Okay?

363
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:08,940
Goodness, let's just go get some food.

364
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:13,900
It'd be better to eat just by ourselves today, right?

365
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:19,270
There could be a round two if we eat together.

366
00:25:19,270 --> 00:25:20,770
Gosh, it's fine.

367
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:23,460
That would really make me a sensitive person.

368
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:27,510
I mean... It's better to eat in a good mood.

369
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:29,120
Will you be okay?

370
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,300
-  Gosh, I'm hungry.  
 - The lunch box is here. Let's eat.

371
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:33,530
-  Hurry up and come.  
 -  Okay, I'm coming! 

372
00:25:33,530 --> 00:25:35,590
All right. Enjoy the food, Ye Seul!

373
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:37,720
 Enjoy your lunch! 

374
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,350
What's wrong now?

375
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:41,830
You said you wanted to eat meat. I ordered four different kinds of fried chicken.

376
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:44,090
You haven't eaten, either. Right?

377
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,060
Hurry up and come out. Okay?

378
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:51,750
Let's go.

379
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:59,970
- Let's go. 
 - Okay.

380
00:25:59,970 --> 00:26:01,640
Whatever.

381
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:04,630
I heard that judge is such a peculiar one.

382
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:07,870
Seriously! He's just like the homeroom teacher back in high school.

383
00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:10,030
The scary ones who give you detention.

384
00:26:10,030 --> 00:26:11,930
 That jerk... 

385
00:26:11,930 --> 00:26:13,710
 It's like nothing happened, huh? 

386
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:14,850
I thought I was back in high school.

387
00:26:14,850 --> 00:26:16,650
Whoa, he's that kind of a character, huh?

388
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:20,460
 Was it the alcohol speaking last night? 

389
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:23,490
 Are we going to make up today? 

390
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:26,640
 Should I try talking to him in the afternoon? 

391
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:29,420
Otherwise, you just need to do it.

392
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,690
Why are you so quiet today?

393
00:26:32,690 --> 00:26:33,970
I know, huh?

394
00:26:33,970 --> 00:26:36,010
Did you two fight?

395
00:26:36,010 --> 00:26:37,490
Huh?

396
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:42,980
We... wrapped things up.

397
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:44,550
What?

398
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:50,360
We couldn't agree about being DINK.

399
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:53,140
So we agreed to end things here.

400
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:05,360
I was going to tell you,

401
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:09,090
but I was out of it because of the accident in the morning.

402
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,910
It's fine. You did well.

403
00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:14,170
Yes. It was the right decision.

404
00:27:14,170 --> 00:27:16,940
I'm okay.

405
00:27:18,130 --> 00:27:21,290
I know. I said you did well.

406
00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:25,390
Honestly, I was so worried you might give up on having kids

407
00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:28,580
because of Goo Eun Beom and do as he says.

408
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:32,740
That's not right. You have your own idea of a family, too.

409
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:38,090
Who said, "Let's break up," first?

410
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:39,680
Did he bring it up?

411
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,200
You did?

412
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:47,890
Well, it was more or less a mutual agreement.

413
00:27:47,890 --> 00:27:49,790
He did bring it up, but...

414
00:27:49,790 --> 00:27:52,310
I also thought it was for the better.

415
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:55,180
So we just agreed on the spot there.

416
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:58,050
I see.

417
00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:01,860
You did well, really.

418
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:41,450
   

419
00:28:42,770 --> 00:28:44,560
   

420
00:28:54,410 --> 00:28:56,040
Hello?

421
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:58,280
Hey, Goo Eun Beom!

422
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,800
Arrogant bastard.

423
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:06,890
 You jerk. 

424
00:29:06,890 --> 00:29:09,030
 Hey, this... 

425
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:11,850
 isn't what I meant... 

426
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:14,160
when I said that back then.

427
00:29:16,650 --> 00:29:19,920
 This isn't what I meant! 

428
00:29:27,010 --> 00:29:29,070
 I still... 

429
00:29:43,310 --> 00:29:45,900
   

430
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:48,720
You crazy—

431
00:29:56,890 --> 00:29:59,330
Just apply for an injunction.

432
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:01,390
So they can't transfer ownership on their own.

433
00:30:01,390 --> 00:30:04,360
How do I then prove it's in an assumed name?

434
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:06,280
It's an assumed name?

435
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:09,070
This is how you do this. Since there's an estimated power of registration,

436
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:10,630
you can first prove it's in an assumed name...

437
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:14,610
 That bastard probably will never quit working here. 

438
00:30:14,610 --> 00:30:16,030
- Isn't that true? 
 - That's true.

439
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:17,190
Exactly. In this state...

440
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:20,990
-  Should I say I'll quit first?  
 - How are they going to prove it?

441
00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:23,630
You're pretty smart.

442
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:27,240
Attorney Oh!

443
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:30,090
What are you doing in the afternoon?

444
00:30:30,090 --> 00:30:32,800
W-Well, I have a client meeting at 2:00.

445
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,550
And I have a seminar offsite at 4:00.

446
00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:36,820
In that case, come see me now.

447
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:39,940
In a case like this, they're picky about the order, so...

448
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:41,680
you have to approach it conservatively.

449
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,110
- Do you understand? 
 - Okay.

450
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:45,360
All right, so look at this here.

451
00:30:51,970 --> 00:30:53,240
   

452
00:31:55,820 --> 00:32:00,250
   

453
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,780
No, this wasn't me...

454
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:08,620
He didn't answer.

455
00:32:31,230 --> 00:32:33,980
Should I cut my hand off?

456
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:43,900
Gosh, why am I craving spicy food?

457
00:32:48,870 --> 00:32:52,050
What should we name our baby's prenatal nickname?

458
00:32:52,050 --> 00:32:53,380
We have to choose one quickly.

459
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:55,300
- Prenatal nickname? 
 - Yes.

460
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:57,890
I heard it's good for the baby if you keep

461
00:32:57,890 --> 00:33:01,080
using the prenatal nickname when you're talking to the baby.

462
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:04,640
The baby gets used to the parents' voices quickly and

463
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,540
has something to do with emotions... What was it again?

464
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:08,010
Anyway, it's good for the baby.

465
00:33:08,010 --> 00:33:10,300
Gosh, look at you. You're so excited.

466
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:12,690
Of course, I'm excited.

467
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:14,940
I thought about it and...

468
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:16,370
Already?

469
00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:18,910
How's Sun?

470
00:33:18,910 --> 00:33:21,750
- What kind of a sun? 
 - It's the sun.

471
00:33:22,550 --> 00:33:25,520
Sun of Bi Chwi.

472
00:33:36,030 --> 00:33:37,640
Hey.

473
00:33:38,390 --> 00:33:41,300
Isn't it funny?

474
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:43,680
Yes, it might not be funny.

475
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:49,450
It's funny, right?

476
00:33:49,450 --> 00:33:51,690
- You're a genius. 
 - Right?

477
00:33:51,690 --> 00:33:53,680
Shall I become a writer?

478
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:58,400
Please come back in two weeks.

479
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,820
When you leave, make an appointment in advance.

480
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:03,220
- Okay. 
 - Oh, and also...

481
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:04,510
what about the nickname?

482
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:06,100
Have you chosen a prenatal nickname?

483
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:08,330
I'm going to write it in our charts.

484
00:34:08,330 --> 00:34:09,720
How did you know? We chose one today.

485
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:11,520
Really? What is it?

486
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:14,600
- It's Sun. 
 - Sunny? It's cute.

487
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,350
Sunny?

488
00:34:16,350 --> 00:34:18,230
Honey, should we do "Sunny?"

489
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:20,330
I think Sunny is easier to call.

490
00:34:20,330 --> 00:34:23,460
Kwon Sun... Kwon Sunny... Yes.

491
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:25,070
Kwon Sunny is easier, right?

492
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:26,610
Hey.

493
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:31,800
Who said you can use Kwon?

494
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,970
If you raise the child,

495
00:34:40,970 --> 00:34:44,550
Ga Ram will give you 700,000 per month as child support.

496
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:47,790
Of course, he'll also diligently do visitation twice per month.

497
00:34:47,790 --> 00:34:49,880
Never mind that.

498
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,670
I'm not raising the child.

499
00:34:51,670 --> 00:34:53,270
Tell him to raise the child.

500
00:34:53,270 --> 00:34:56,920
If Ga Ram has to raise the child...

501
00:34:56,920 --> 00:35:00,330
you'll have to pay child support, Mi Hyang.

502
00:35:00,330 --> 00:35:01,740
You know that, right?

503
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:03,540
Yes.

504
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:08,040
However, I'm highly likely to make less money than him.

505
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:11,440
So I won't have to pay much for child support.

506
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:14,410
Well, according to your income.

507
00:35:14,410 --> 00:35:18,680
Even if he sues me, I don't have a penny right now.

508
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:21,030
So I heard he's more likely to get custody.

509
00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:22,920
Am I right?

510
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:27,040
If he's ordered to raise the child through a suit,

511
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:30,490
Ga Ram said he doesn't have the confidence to raise the child.

512
00:35:30,490 --> 00:35:32,240
What the heck does he want to do, then?

513
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,650
If he's ordered to raise the child,

514
00:35:34,650 --> 00:35:39,710
Ga Ram said... he might end up sending the child to an orphanage.

515
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:42,430
Will you be okay with that?

516
00:35:43,070 --> 00:35:46,840
It's not like the child was raised in an orphanage.

517
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:51,350
It'll be very hard to get used to an unfamiliar environment suddenly.

518
00:35:51,350 --> 00:35:55,350
Are you really okay with the child...

519
00:35:55,350 --> 00:35:57,610
getting sent to an orphanage?

520
00:36:02,750 --> 00:36:05,770
That crazy bastard's the one who's doing that!

521
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:10,650
So...

522
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:13,250
it can't be helped.

523
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:16,770
I'm not saying this because I'm Ga Ram's attorney.

524
00:36:16,770 --> 00:36:22,000
Since the child currently has a better emotional rapport with the mother...

525
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:26,300
wouldn't it be better for you to raise the child, Mi Hyang?

526
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:28,880
While getting child support.

527
00:36:29,910 --> 00:36:31,650
Well...

528
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:36,610
By the way, Attorney Oh...

529
00:36:36,610 --> 00:36:39,560
can I ask you one thing, then?

530
00:36:43,170 --> 00:36:45,340
He has a woman, doesn't he?

531
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:50,110
He's having an affair, isn't he?

532
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:54,700
I-I'm not sure.

533
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:57,030
That's why he's trying so hard to get a divorce and

534
00:36:57,030 --> 00:37:00,160
doing everything not to raise his own child.

535
00:37:05,830 --> 00:37:09,370
He has a woman, right?

536
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:17,220
Mi Hyang... do you really...

537
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:21,270
intend to get a divorce, by any chance?

538
00:37:21,270 --> 00:37:24,410
Did you do it in the spur of the moment?

539
00:37:25,330 --> 00:37:28,160
You don't really want to get a divorce, do you?

540
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:54,800
Yes, Ga Ram.

541
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:57,760
Are you free to talk for a minute?

542
00:37:58,490 --> 00:38:01,960
Oh, I just had...

543
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:06,750
one thing I wanted to confirm.

544
00:38:07,970 --> 00:38:09,620
Ga Ram...

545
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:14,160
are you dead set on getting a divorce right now?

546
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:21,760
I'm asking because I feel sorry for the child.

547
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:25,210
Is divorce really the only answer?

548
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:28,640
Don't ever tell him...

549
00:38:29,790 --> 00:38:32,530
that I feel that way.

550
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:36,360
If the two of you have room for reconciliation...

551
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:40,100
wouldn't it be best for you to make up?

552
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:43,670
- Please think about it one more— 
 -  It's not like this is just a fight. 

553
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:46,200
 She's saying she wants a divorce, so why would we make up? 

554
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:50,290
I mean... since you have a child— 
 -  Please just proceed on to the trial. 

555
00:38:50,290 --> 00:38:53,810
 You can stop caring about the child. He's not even yours. 

556
00:38:55,730 --> 00:38:57,310
Okay.

557
00:38:58,140 --> 00:39:01,090
Okay, I got it. Sure.

558
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:03,650
Take care.

559
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:09,440
Gosh, why does she like a man like him?

560
00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:14,630
Gosh, I just can't understand.

561
00:39:22,730 --> 00:39:24,650
Excuse me, Attorney Oh.

562
00:39:24,650 --> 00:39:27,000
Was that lady earlier...

563
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,650
the wife of the man getting his third divorce?

564
00:39:30,650 --> 00:39:32,930
Yes. But why?

565
00:39:32,930 --> 00:39:35,010
W-Well, it's nothing.

566
00:39:35,010 --> 00:39:38,930
How old is she? She seemed to be pretty young.

567
00:39:38,930 --> 00:39:40,180
He said she's his ideal type.

568
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:43,070
When he saw her on the first floor, he thought about getting her number.

569
00:39:43,070 --> 00:39:46,800
N-No, no! When did I ever say I was thinking of getting her number?

570
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:49,040
What's wrong with you?

571
00:39:49,950 --> 00:39:51,510
That's really not it, okay?

572
00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:53,380
She got divorced three times...

573
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:55,410
I'm not crazy!

574
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:07,630
Mr. Seong, that was a mistake just now, wasn't it?

575
00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:10,870
I think Attorney Oh is really mad.

576
00:40:10,870 --> 00:40:12,980
Why? What did I do?

577
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:14,650
How can you say such a biased statement

578
00:40:14,650 --> 00:40:17,460
about divorce to a divorce lawyer who got a divorce?

579
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:20,190
I was just saying—

580
00:40:20,190 --> 00:40:22,180
I can understand getting divorced once.

581
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:25,530
- But three times? 
 - Huh? What about you?

582
00:40:25,530 --> 00:40:28,350
You got rejected 12 times in a row on blind dates.

583
00:40:28,350 --> 00:40:30,320
- What— 
 - Gosh!

584
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:32,320
Wait, that's—

585
00:40:35,190 --> 00:40:37,930
Help me with this before you go!

586
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:52,430
   
 We'll proceed to the trial. 

587
00:40:52,430 --> 00:40:53,900
 But Mi Hyang... 

588
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:58,180
 one of the workers in our office said you're his ideal type... 

589
00:40:58,180 --> 00:41:00,660
 and that he fell for you at first sight. 

590
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:03,910
 Do you want to grab dinner with him after the trial? 

591
00:41:03,910 --> 00:41:06,450
 He's a really fine young man— 

592
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:13,650
 Fine single man. 

593
00:41:22,830 --> 00:41:23,970
   

594
00:41:29,550 --> 00:41:31,480
   

595
00:41:39,130 --> 00:41:42,130
- Yes, hello— 
 -  Attorney Oh, what's this text? 

596
00:41:43,970 --> 00:41:47,490
Yes, Ga Ram. Oh... my goodness.

597
00:41:47,490 --> 00:41:50,240
That was sent to you?

598
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:52,150
Aigoo, silly me.

599
00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:54,320
 What the heck is this shit? 

600
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:58,540
I mean, you'll be strangers after the trial. Why get so mad?

601
00:41:58,540 --> 00:42:02,300
 Whether we become strangers or not, does this situation make sense logically? 

602
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:05,860
 Also, the divorce suit isn't even over yet— 

603
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:07,850
Well, okay.

604
00:42:07,850 --> 00:42:11,100
If you don't like it that much, we'll have to call it off.

605
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:12,680
Or go on with it secretly.

606
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:14,070
 Have you gone mad, seriously? 

607
00:42:14,070 --> 00:42:18,070
Okay, okay. It's a joke.

608
00:42:18,070 --> 00:42:21,470
Don't get too furious and hang up now. Okay.

609
00:42:21,470 --> 00:42:24,510
Okay, take care. Yes.

610
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:29,770
Hey, who the heck was that yelling at you?

611
00:42:29,770 --> 00:42:33,560
- And why would you smile at that? 
 - There's a reason.

612
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:37,780
A cute client who's in first-dimensional love.

613
00:42:38,770 --> 00:42:41,720
What's the matter? Do you want to go get dinner already?

614
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:43,730
No.

615
00:42:47,130 --> 00:42:51,870
I think I'll have to call off this marriage.

616
00:42:52,730 --> 00:42:55,490
Whoa, I'm really sick of this.

617
00:42:55,490 --> 00:42:56,940
What is it now?

618
00:42:56,940 --> 00:43:01,780
She keeps making threats, saying she'll call off the marriage or not give birth.

619
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:03,920
What do I do about this?

620
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:05,580
I'm about to lose it and go nuts.

621
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:07,540
Hey, just let her do it her way.

622
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:10,200
What's a last name when you're giving up your career?

623
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:13,230
- What's in a last name? 
 - Don't you know I'm the fifth-generation only son?

624
00:43:13,230 --> 00:43:14,880
This is a great last name I've got.

625
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:18,190
Do you know how much effort my dad put into giving birth to me?

626
00:43:18,190 --> 00:43:21,430
You don't know anything to be judging a noble last name.

627
00:43:21,430 --> 00:43:23,890
I think Senior Kang is good at making choices.

628
00:43:23,890 --> 00:43:25,620
CEO Seo, this is really too much, isn't it?

629
00:43:25,620 --> 00:43:27,340
What will they say if I tell my family about this?

630
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:31,560
Won't I get disowned? My dad will faint from the shock and—

631
00:43:33,230 --> 00:43:35,000
Head of Family Act was repealed a long time ago.

632
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,220
Why worry about getting disowned?

633
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:40,300
If you keep saying such ignorant things as a divorce lawyer...

634
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:44,700
you'll be disowned by the Divorce Lawyer Association.

635
00:43:47,310 --> 00:43:49,680
Gosh, I haven't had gukbap in forever.

636
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:53,390
CEO Seo, you don't understand what my family is like. My fam—

637
00:43:58,210 --> 00:43:59,650
Let's go somewhere else.

638
00:43:59,650 --> 00:44:02,040
They already made themselves at home.

639
00:44:03,580 --> 00:44:06,030
S-She... She's t-trying to drink alcohol—

640
00:44:06,030 --> 00:44:07,780
Has she gone mad? See what I mean?

641
00:44:07,780 --> 00:44:10,510
She's completely reckless these days!

642
00:44:12,790 --> 00:44:16,940
Goodness. What bad timing.

643
00:44:16,940 --> 00:44:19,690
Noona, have you gone mad?

644
00:44:19,690 --> 00:44:21,650
Are you trying to drink alcohol?

645
00:44:21,650 --> 00:44:23,900
- You really are crazy. 
 - Hey, this place has non-alcohol—

646
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:26,100
Hey, why do you care?

647
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:28,610
You eat everything you want and do as you please.

648
00:44:28,610 --> 00:44:30,120
Okay, I won't drink, either. Let's go.

649
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:32,090
    
 Let go. I don't want to.

650
00:44:32,090 --> 00:44:34,040
Please, let's go. Let's talk on the way.

651
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:35,970
Stop grabbing me!

652
00:44:35,970 --> 00:44:37,790
Hey, Si Wook...

653
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:41,880
You can answer your phone.

654
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:45,670
Even if it says non-alcohol and all, you need to look into it carefully.

655
00:44:45,670 --> 00:44:47,280
Gosh, seriously...

656
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:50,090
- Yes, Ga Ram. 
 - Let's go. Come on. Let go.

657
00:44:50,090 --> 00:44:51,470
- Sorry? 
 - Don't do this.

658
00:44:51,470 --> 00:44:53,160
You fought with Mi Hyang?

659
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:56,150
I said stop forcing me with your strength!

660
00:45:00,350 --> 00:45:03,930
Oh my god! Mommy!

661
00:45:12,310 --> 00:45:14,600
Si Wook!

662
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:24,510
Wait, Ga Ram... what happened—

663
00:45:31,090 --> 00:45:34,190
This is all your fault, Attorney Oh.

664
00:45:34,190 --> 00:45:36,570
It's because you told me...

665
00:45:36,570 --> 00:45:41,030
you're going to introduce her to someone.

666
00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:43,190
I only went to...

667
00:45:44,170 --> 00:45:48,610
warn her I won't let her be if she meets someone else.

668
00:45:48,610 --> 00:45:52,000
If only she had just answered me...

669
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:58,350
Seriously...

670
00:46:28,970 --> 00:46:33,270
I'm sorry. It's not even your fault.

671
00:46:37,540 --> 00:46:40,170
We have such an ill fate, seriously.

672
00:46:42,510 --> 00:46:45,400
We should've broken up a long time ago.

673
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:48,610
Why did I keep getting back together with her?

674
00:47:07,390 --> 00:47:10,170
 We have such an ill fate, seriously. 

675
00:47:10,170 --> 00:47:13,190
 We should've broken up a long time ago. 

676
00:47:13,190 --> 00:47:16,260
 Why did I keep getting back together with her? 

677
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:22,210
 - I'm sorry. 
 - What are you sorry for? 

678
00:47:22,210 --> 00:47:24,640
 I'm just sorry for everything! 

679
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:28,820
 You're really... completely ignorant to my feelings. 

680
00:47:28,820 --> 00:47:31,390
 Forget it! Let's stop it. 

681
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:34,710
 Stop what? I'm saying I'm sorry and apologizing! 

682
00:47:34,710 --> 00:47:36,630
 I said forget it! 

683
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:42,470
 Let's... get a divorce. 

684
00:47:42,470 --> 00:47:45,350
 What are you saying? 

685
00:47:49,250 --> 00:47:52,820
 I'm seeing someone else. I'm sorry. 

686
00:47:54,940 --> 00:47:57,420
 Let's just end things here. 

687
00:47:57,420 --> 00:47:59,850
 Let's wrap it up. 

688
00:48:15,820 --> 00:48:17,380
Hello?

689
00:48:17,380 --> 00:48:19,780
 Oh. Where are you? 

690
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:22,600
I'm on my way after meeting Ga Ram.

691
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:25,550
 Oh, that's good. You can talk, right? 

692
00:48:25,550 --> 00:48:28,320
I called to let you know since you might be curious.

693
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:30,390
They said Si Wook's fine.

694
00:48:30,390 --> 00:48:32,830
 His neck ligament is a little stretched, but that's about— 

695
00:48:32,830 --> 00:48:34,610
I'm glad.

696
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:37,790
I'm really glad.

697
00:48:38,750 --> 00:48:42,760
Are you okay? You don't sound too good.

698
00:48:48,940 --> 00:48:50,540
 Hello? 

699
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:54,340
Hello?

700
00:48:56,470 --> 00:48:58,290
Eun Beom...

701
00:49:01,210 --> 00:49:03,770
Don't call me anymore.

702
00:49:05,230 --> 00:49:10,330
 Also... stop treating me well. 

703
00:49:10,330 --> 00:49:13,740
Don't go along with it when I play the baby.

704
00:49:13,740 --> 00:49:18,470
I hope you'll also... stop worrying about me now.

705
00:49:19,860 --> 00:49:21,990
 Whenever you do that... 

706
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:24,840
 I waver. 

707
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:31,940
I'm really going to...

708
00:49:31,940 --> 00:49:34,960
try to get over you now.

709
00:49:38,150 --> 00:49:42,910
I think people who keep breaking up and making up...

710
00:49:42,910 --> 00:49:46,110
are just not meant to be.

711
00:49:46,830 --> 00:49:52,040
 I... thought we'll be able to start anew again, 

712
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:57,440
even if we keep breaking up and making up.

713
00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:00,460
 But I don't think that's true. 

714
00:50:00,460 --> 00:50:03,160
I thought wrong. Don't you think?

715
00:50:04,180 --> 00:50:05,810
 In this world... 

716
00:50:05,810 --> 00:50:09,750
 there are couples who are just fundamentally not meant to be. Right? 

717
00:50:09,750 --> 00:50:15,770
Relationships that have... obvious endings.

718
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:23,560
Sorry for calling you all this time.

719
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:25,760
Sorry for making you uncomfortable.

720
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:27,490
And...

721
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:32,300
thank you.

722
00:50:39,810 --> 00:50:41,320
For what?

723
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:45,430
Everything.

724
00:50:52,910 --> 00:50:56,310
Thanks for creating great memories for me.

725
00:50:59,100 --> 00:51:02,230
Not all of our memories were great,

726
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:05,160
 but... 

727
00:51:06,850 --> 00:51:09,400
the moments we spent together...

728
00:51:10,430 --> 00:51:12,450
were happy for me.

729
00:51:19,830 --> 00:51:21,630
Eun Beom,

730
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:25,160
 thank you. 

731
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:28,720
Let's live happily.

732
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:30,370
Both of us.

733
00:51:33,420 --> 00:51:38,060
♫  I finally had realized  ♫

734
00:51:38,060 --> 00:51:39,960
I'm going to hang up first.

735
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:42,860
♫  Among my hidden pains  ♫

736
00:51:42,860 --> 00:51:44,780
Goodbye.

737
00:51:44,780 --> 00:51:51,590
♫  Another me was in there  ♫

738
00:51:53,030 --> 00:51:57,990
♫  The light from the window  ♫

739
00:51:59,540 --> 00:52:03,180
♫  My heart that was in darkness  ♫

740
00:52:03,180 --> 00:52:05,170
 Hey, get on. 

741
00:52:05,170 --> 00:52:06,790
 Gosh. Seriously. 

742
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:10,960
♫  Shines a new hope into it  ♫

743
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:17,670
♫  Everything is so radiant  ♫

744
00:52:19,690 --> 00:52:21,430
 Let's see each other. 

745
00:52:21,430 --> 00:52:24,550
 - Right now? 
 - No. Again. 

746
00:52:24,550 --> 00:52:26,760
 Really? 

747
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:31,710
♫  Becomes a strength for me  ♫

748
00:52:31,710 --> 00:52:35,710
♫  All of the happy memories  ♫

749
00:52:35,710 --> 00:52:36,990
 Feels like we're cutting class. 

750
00:52:36,990 --> 00:52:40,330
♫  My way  ♫

751
00:52:40,330 --> 00:52:42,610
 I think I can eat tteokbokki every day if I have to. 

752
00:52:42,610 --> 00:52:44,730
 I guess I'll have to make it every day, then. 

753
00:52:44,730 --> 00:52:46,330
 Come on. 

754
00:52:49,870 --> 00:52:59,420
♫  My way, I walk on my way  ♫

755
00:53:22,540 --> 00:53:24,590
Thank you.

756
00:53:26,220 --> 00:53:27,910
We should talk first.

757
00:53:27,910 --> 00:53:30,200
Talk about what?

758
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:32,440
- We need to talk. 
 - Let's hurry up.

759
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:35,290
I'm sleepy, exhausted, and just want to go to sleep.

760
00:53:35,290 --> 00:53:37,190
Gosh.

761
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:42,470
Let's go.

762
00:53:42,470 --> 00:53:44,580
Si Wook,

763
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:47,650
- let's just— 
 - No.

764
00:53:47,650 --> 00:53:49,070
No.

765
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:51,620
Okay? Don't.

766
00:53:51,620 --> 00:53:53,350
Being stubborn won't solve anything.

767
00:53:53,350 --> 00:53:55,630
No, no.

768
00:53:55,630 --> 00:53:58,310
I'm not being stubborn. I'll do better.

769
00:53:58,310 --> 00:54:01,510
I'll be a good man. That'll do.

770
00:54:02,580 --> 00:54:04,820
It's difficult for you, too.

771
00:54:06,690 --> 00:54:08,880
- Let's just— 
 - Please.

772
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:13,050
I'm doing this again. Sorry.

773
00:54:18,290 --> 00:54:20,670
You know it, too.

774
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:23,980
Noona...

775
00:54:23,980 --> 00:54:25,790
What are you—

776
00:54:26,420 --> 00:54:29,560
As I rolled down those stairs earlier,

777
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:32,060
do you know what I thought during that split second?

778
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:34,600
I felt hopeless, thinking Sunny might become fatherless.

779
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:36,380
I don't care what happens to me, but

780
00:54:36,380 --> 00:54:39,510
thinking you becoming a widow and Sunny becoming fatherless...

781
00:54:39,510 --> 00:54:40,990
Gosh, I really...

782
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:44,850
"I should've had a billion-won life insurance." That's all I thought about.

783
00:54:44,850 --> 00:54:48,520
"If I don't die, I should get a billion-won life insurance."

784
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:51,080
That's the only thought I had.

785
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:53,080
And that...

786
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:55,800
I should never argue with you again.

787
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:57,560
That's what I thought.

788
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:04,520
Let's not fight, okay? We love each other.

789
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:06,790
Let's not be like that.

790
00:55:06,790 --> 00:55:09,390
Sure, Goo Eun Beom was right.

791
00:55:09,390 --> 00:55:11,130
What's in a last name?

792
00:55:11,130 --> 00:55:13,550
What's in a last name when you're...

793
00:55:13,550 --> 00:55:15,560
risking your life to give birth?

794
00:55:15,560 --> 00:55:18,000
That's not what I need to protect with my pride.

795
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:20,860
I'll give that up.

796
00:55:22,420 --> 00:55:26,060
However, there's one thing you need to know.

797
00:55:26,060 --> 00:55:28,710
I might really get disowned.

798
00:55:28,710 --> 00:55:31,140
I'll try telling my family about it if you're okay with it.

799
00:55:31,140 --> 00:55:33,380
But I'll be shot down 100%, and I'll get disowned.

800
00:55:33,380 --> 00:55:37,390
Also, my family was going to provide support when I got married.

801
00:55:37,390 --> 00:55:38,990
But I'll probably lose that, too.

802
00:55:38,990 --> 00:55:42,130
To be honest, I don't have much in my savings.

803
00:55:42,130 --> 00:55:44,090
But if you say you don't care about those things,

804
00:55:44,090 --> 00:55:46,500
I'll call my family right now.

805
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:48,180
You're okay, right?

806
00:55:53,130 --> 00:55:55,180
Wait a second.

807
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:59,000
Try telling them and...

808
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,480
if they say no, just forget about it.

809
00:56:01,480 --> 00:56:03,380
I'll give it up.

810
00:56:04,370 --> 00:56:06,340
Whether you can...

811
00:56:07,750 --> 00:56:11,290
give it up or not was more important for me.

812
00:56:14,790 --> 00:56:16,700
I love you.

813
00:56:18,630 --> 00:56:20,520
- Me, too. 
 - No...

814
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:23,110
Tell me you love me.

815
00:56:23,110 --> 00:56:25,200
I love you, too.

816
00:56:35,060 --> 00:56:37,570
Mi Hyang agreed to raise the child in the end.

817
00:56:37,570 --> 00:56:39,680
We submitted the divorce agreement yesterday.

818
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:41,520
I'm glad.

819
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:44,590
They won't get back for the fourth time, will they?

820
00:56:44,590 --> 00:56:47,420
What if they come back next year to get another divorce?

821
00:56:47,420 --> 00:56:50,540
I told Mi Hyang this.

822
00:56:50,540 --> 00:56:54,160
It could be because she's never met another person.

823
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:56,810
She married when she was too young and

824
00:56:56,810 --> 00:56:59,290
only dated that person, so...

825
00:56:59,290 --> 00:57:03,400
that world might feel like everything to her.

826
00:57:06,610 --> 00:57:09,790
So try to have a serious relationship with someone else

827
00:57:09,790 --> 00:57:12,310
and broaden her perspectives.

828
00:57:12,310 --> 00:57:15,590
Whoa, that's quite a statement.

829
00:57:15,590 --> 00:57:19,500
You should've told her to heed what you say since it's from a divorce lawyer who got divorced.

830
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:22,190
I'm not sure. Even if I lecture her all day,

831
00:57:22,190 --> 00:57:23,450
she needs to feel it firsthand.

832
00:57:23,450 --> 00:57:25,740
That's right. She needs to experience it herself.

833
00:57:25,740 --> 00:57:28,150
Doesn't this apply to all of us?

834
00:57:28,150 --> 00:57:31,820
Where's this friendly fire coming from all of a sudden?

835
00:57:31,820 --> 00:57:35,900
Anyhow, could you do wedding parties with your neck in that shape?

836
00:57:35,900 --> 00:57:37,500
I can take it off after a few days.

837
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:39,940
Also, wedding preparations are sailing smoothly!

838
00:57:39,940 --> 00:57:42,420
- What's sailing smoothly? 
 - Explain more in detail. What did you get done?

839
00:57:42,420 --> 00:57:44,490
Are you really making any preparations?

840
00:57:44,490 --> 00:57:46,980
- He's saying no to everything. 
 - To everything?

841
00:57:54,890 --> 00:57:58,350
- What? 
 - You're going to quit working here?

842
00:57:58,350 --> 00:57:59,910
Yes.

843
00:57:59,910 --> 00:58:01,450
Where are you going to go?

844
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:04,260
- Anywhere. 
 - Why, all of a sudden?

845
00:58:04,260 --> 00:58:06,550
You don't even have a place to go to.

846
00:58:06,550 --> 00:58:07,980
I have my reason.

847
00:58:07,980 --> 00:58:10,250
What is this reason you speak of?

848
00:58:13,790 --> 00:58:15,210
   

849
00:58:15,210 --> 00:58:18,600
Your complete medical examination result is fine.

850
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:22,960
It seems highly likely to be a psychogenic disease.

851
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:26,230
Have you been under a lot of stress lately?

852
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:38,530
Don't ask about it. Please... just understand.

853
00:58:41,650 --> 00:58:43,760
I'll pack everything...

854
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:46,820
by the end of this month. Okay?

855
00:58:48,250 --> 00:58:52,380
By any chance... did Ha Ra dump you?

856
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,320
In the first place, I know you...

857
00:58:56,320 --> 00:58:59,690
came in here with an ulterior motive.

858
00:58:59,690 --> 00:59:02,810
You seem to be cutting your tail off and running away because it didn't work out again.

859
00:59:02,810 --> 00:59:04,980
Just like three years ago.

860
00:59:09,830 --> 00:59:12,450
It's because of Ha Ra, isn't it?

861
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:31,580


862
00:59:33,950 --> 00:59:36,860
♫  It didn't feel like much  ♫

863
00:59:36,860 --> 00:59:40,250
 Congratulations! 

864
00:59:40,250 --> 00:59:41,950
 That's right. Your families are meeting today. 

865
00:59:41,950 --> 00:59:43,530
 Yes. Let's talk tomorrow. 

866
00:59:43,530 --> 00:59:46,370
 I keep thinking if it's okay for me to go this way. 

867
00:59:46,370 --> 00:59:49,620
 There's no paradise on the run. 

868
00:59:49,620 --> 00:59:53,050
 If you can't avoid it, you might as well embrace it. 

869
00:59:53,050 --> 00:59:54,940
 They said your mother collapsed! 

870
00:59:54,940 --> 00:59:57,980
 Don't regret it and say everything you want to say to your mother right now. 

871
00:59:57,980 --> 01:00:00,800
 Why are you so good to me? 

872
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:04,480
 Why don't you leave the office instead of Eun Beom? 

873
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:08,080
