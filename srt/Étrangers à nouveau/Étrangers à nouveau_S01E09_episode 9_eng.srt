1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,970


2
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:12,110
   

3
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:13,230
   

4
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:36,020
   

5
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:40,940
   

6
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:43,540
   

7
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:45,700
Is anyone working late tonight?

8
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:47,010
I'm going to go get dinner.

9
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:48,720
I have a blind date today.

10
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:52,270
I was wondering when you'll be going on one this week.

11
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:53,350
What about you?

12
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:55,800
My roommate says she's not feeling well,

13
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,420
so I think I should go home.

14
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:01,750
 Unni, where are you? 

15
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:06,000
 I have some news! I have some news! I have big news for you! 

16
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:13,930
Attorney Oh! You said you're eating dinner, right?

17
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:15,590
Yes, yes.

18
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,890
I'm not eating dinner.

19
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:21,160
Huh? You're not?

20
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:23,480
Yes, I...

21
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:26,720
I made plans.

22
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:31,090
Did something good happen today?

23
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:34,040
I mean, d-do I...

24
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:36,180
look that h-happy?

25
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:37,230
- Yes. 
 - Very.

26
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:39,330
Exceptionally.

27
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:47,860
You know, Kim Ga Eun's... case was wrapped up nicely.

28
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:12,390
   
 (Dual Income, No Kids) 

29
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:21,760
 Was the meal okay? 

30
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,380
 Yes, it was delicious. 

31
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:25,740
 Excuse me, but how old are you? 

32
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:30,310
26 years old?

33
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:32,580
How old are you?

34
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:33,900
It is a secret.

35
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,900
I'll tell you when we're closer.

36
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,590
   
 Mr. Seong is here! 

37
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:00,700
 Let's go somewhere else! 

38
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:15,350
I work at a... law firm.

39
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:23,020
What do you do on your days off?

40
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:26,420
I just read books or watch movies.

41
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:28,130
Excuse me?

42
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:29,600
Yes.

43
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:33,340
Where's the restroom?

44
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:34,810
Oh, the restroom?

45
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:36,070
It's that way.

46
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:38,070
- Excuse me. 
 - Sure.

47
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:47,710
What are you doing?

48
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:55,350
(Come here. Come here.)

49
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:57,310
(Hurry up and come.)

50
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:10,180
That guy's always on a blind date.

51
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:12,930
Mr. Seong couldn't see us, right?

52
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:17,310
- Us meeting or... us hiding? 
 - Both.

53
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:20,100
Wait!  Did we commit a crime? Why did we hide?

54
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:22,800
- Let's go in. 
 - Are you crazy?

55
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,230
- I'm going. 
 - Where are you going?

56
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:28,070
I'm going to my car.

57
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:29,980
Let me know where you want to go.

58
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,960
Seriously.

59
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:54,990
Thank you.

60
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:57,960
Hey...

61
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:00,140
Nice house.

62
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:03,550
Thanks to monthly alimony from someone.

63
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,060
Hey, you should eat rice. Why would you eat cereal?

64
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:10,600
At least I took care of breakfast.

65
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:14,420
I'm going to hang my clothes. Do you want me to take yours?

66
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:17,890
Sure.

67
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:19,620
How awkward.

68
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,370
Take a look around.

69
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:33,430
- By the way— 
 - By the way—

70
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:35,580
- You go first— 
 - You go first—

71
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:42,100
Gosh, we're hilarious.

72
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:44,170
That's what I'm saying.

73
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:45,630
This is so awkward.

74
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:48,060
I-It feels so weird.

75
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:59,540
So...

76
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:05,300
what made you decide to see me... again?

77
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,520
Well...

78
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,970
I don't understand, either.

79
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:20,590
You keep on bothering and harassing me.

80
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:24,540
I mean... I'm the same.

81
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:26,250
Anyway,

82
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:30,180
I kept worrying about you...

83
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:32,030
 Eun Beom. 

84
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:38,260
 I really want to die. 

85
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,850
 Where are you? 

86
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:49,030
 It made me angry and frustrated when you cried... 

87
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:59,440
 and made me want to embrace and console you. 

88
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,700
 Like how I used to feel before. 

89
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:13,430
Then, why did you reject me nine times?

90
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:16,120
You should've given in earlier.

91
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:25,110
I absolutely couldn't understand your feelings.

92
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:27,650
When you should be loathing and cursing me...

93
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:30,930
it's weird that you love me.

94
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,080
It's not understandable.

95
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:38,710
But after hearing you out, I could understand.

96
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:42,930
Because feelings I don't understand, also exist within me.

97
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:47,500
I still question whether this is right,

98
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:51,950
but I just want to act on my feelings... for now.

99
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:59,500
Just like when you divorced me?

100
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:11,260
I'm scared.

101
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:23,720
I'll be good to you.

102
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:27,670
I'm sorry.

103
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:42,290
This isn't a dream, is it?

104
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:47,130
You want me to pinch you?

105
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:48,900
- Come here. 
 - Huh?

106
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:51,430
Let me get you good.

107
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:53,350
Really?

108
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:10,910
This isn't a dream, is it?

109
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,110
   

110
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:44,880
Bi Chwi.

111
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,810
Bitch.

112
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:50,330
Hold on.

113
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:51,790
 Hey, Unni. 

114
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:53,490
Hey.

115
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:55,660
I'm pregnant.

116
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:57,410
 H-Huh? 

117
00:09:57,410 --> 00:09:59,510
Hold on.

118
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:06,780
What's going on?

119
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:08,970
Unni, you're not joking. Right?

120
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:12,750
Do you think I'm crazy enough to joke about this?

121
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,920
This is crazy.

122
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:18,600
- You didn't use contraceptives? 
  - I did. 

123
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,660
I did, but...

124
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:24,510
How did this happen? Huh?

125
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:25,640
What happened?

126
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:30,040
So who's the baby's father? Did you tell him?

127
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,630
Why would I tell him?

128
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:34,820
It's not like I'll ask him to take responsibility.

129
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:39,450
Then... what can you do by yourself?

130
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:41,720
I'm going to the OB/GYN tomorrow.

131
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,820
You said you have an OB/GYN friend, right?

132
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:45,850
Where's her office?

133
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:47,570
Of course, of course.

134
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:51,010
Tomorrow... Tomorrow...

135
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:52,420
What time should we go?

136
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:55,310
 - You're going, too?  
 - Of course, I am!

137
00:10:56,210 --> 00:10:58,760
Were you planning to go by yourself?

138
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:03,940
 How are you feeling? Are you okay? 

139
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:07,510
I'm not. My head hurts.

140
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:18,760
Sorry. Something came up with Unni.

141
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:21,780
Wait!  You cleaned everything?

142
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:24,290
A while ago.

143
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:27,060
Go have a seat. I'll brew you tea.

144
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:31,720
It's late, so you prefer tea over coffee. Right?

145
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,320
Yeah.

146
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:39,290
What did Senior Bi Chwi say? Nothing serious, right?

147
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:41,120
Yeah.

148
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:45,360
Apparently, her client is being difficult.

149
00:11:58,650 --> 00:12:02,560
Are you... staying the night?

150
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:09,870
I mean, I need to stop by somewhere in the morning, so I can leave late.

151
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:12,080
And you have a trial in the morning, too.

152
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:15,420
If you're not in a hurry, then...

153
00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:20,970
Is this too soon?

154
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:23,380
On the first day of getting back together...

155
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:29,160
I don't know.

156
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:34,120
It's also my first time dating my ex-wife.

157
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:42,870
Second Oldest Aunt?

158
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:45,430
Should I ignore the call?

159
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:47,550
No, go ahead and pick up.

160
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,480
Sorry.

161
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:54,630
Yes, Auntie.

162
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:03,270
No, I'm not busy.

163
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:08,840
But I'm with... someone right now.

164
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,010
Sorry? A divorce?

165
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:20,270
Jeong Soo is getting a divorce? Why?

166
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,310
Jeong Soo?

167
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:28,320
Whoa, I thought I heard it all.

168
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:32,310
You two debated for 100 minutes because of your cousin?

169
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:34,250
On your very first night?

170
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:38,620
I want to... kill my cousin.

171
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:41,220
Gosh. I mean, what's his story?

172
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:48,880
Well... I feel uncomfortable telling you at the moment.

173
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:51,920
What is it? Tell me.

174
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,660
What? They're getting a divorce because...

175
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:01,930
the wife got an abortion without telling him?

176
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:06,740
The cousin is saying she can't do that

177
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:09,650
without even talking to him about it.

178
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:15,900
But his shock is understandable since they're a married couple.

179
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:18,960
Family planning is an important issue for a couple.

180
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:21,610
But it's a little vague.

181
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:23,190
They're actually DINK.

182
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:24,370
DINK?  (Dual Income, No Kids) 

183
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:26,910
They agreed not to have children before getting married.

184
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:29,550
So she thought there was no need to tell him

185
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:32,670
and went ahead without consulting him.

186
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:34,720
Well, I guess...

187
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:37,480
that's understandable.

188
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,290
Huh?

189
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:44,380
I wonder if it's because I'm his cousin, but I understand his position better.

190
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:47,250
However, Goo Eun Beom said he could understand the wife's position.

191
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:49,690
Because he's not his cousin?

192
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:53,770
That's probably not it.

193
00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:57,450
Do you know why he's siding with the wife?

194
00:14:57,450 --> 00:14:59,940
He said if he happens to get married again,

195
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,800
he wants to live as a DINK.

196
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,690
DINK?

197
00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:06,600
- Why? 
 - That's what I asked him.

198
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,930
 Why don't you want to have children? 

199
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:12,900
 Well, why do you want to have children? 

200
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:14,430
 They're cute. 

201
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:17,830
 My baby. A mini-me between you and me. 

202
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:21,880
 Isn't it a human's natural instinct to want offspring? 

203
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:23,990
 Yes, they're cute. 

204
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:27,130
 But... your body wears out, your money vanishes, 

205
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:29,050
 my time, and life will be gone... 

206
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:30,080
 It's hard. 

207
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:34,080
 Isn't it more of an instinct for a human to want to avoid something tough? 

208
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:36,670
 It won't be hard if they take after me. 

209
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:39,400
 It'll be very tough if they take after me. 

210
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:45,840
That's right. Yes, that's right...

211
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,600
Really?

212
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,170
That's what you think, too?

213
00:15:56,730 --> 00:16:00,600
What I mean is... even if I was married,

214
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:04,300
it still wouldn't be an easy decision.

215
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:06,010
Having to exchange my ambition

216
00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:09,250
and the career for someone I don't even love yet

217
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:11,710
is honestly unimaginable.

218
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:14,590
I think I'm already in love.

219
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:16,260
If you want to have children,

220
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:19,970
don't you have to rethink dating Goo Eun Beom?

221
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:23,510
Well, for now, we'll talk about it and

222
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:25,100
find the compromising point.

223
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:28,560
Is it up for compromise? It's yes or no.

224
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:33,320
I mean... since it was hard to get back together,

225
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,590
we shouldn't jump to conclusions and

226
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:39,110
make a careful decision. So, he says.

227
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:43,000
He's saying he'll convince you.

228
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:48,450
Gosh, Oh Ha Ra. You're about to be a DINK just because of a man.

229
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:50,070
No, never!

230
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:51,910
I'm...

231
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:55,200
going to convince him.

232
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,000
- Kang Bi Chwi? 
 - Yes?

233
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,790
Please go into Exam Room 7.

234
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:03,940
I'll be back. Let's talk later.

235
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:19,650
Do you see that small dot in the lower left corner?

236
00:17:21,330 --> 00:17:24,550
Which dot are you talking about?

237
00:17:25,090 --> 00:17:26,800
Here, this one.

238
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,630
Do you see it?

239
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:30,240
Yes.

240
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,860
It's nicely implanted into your uterus.

241
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:51,170
Yes, it must've been tough on you, too, Sister-in-law.

242
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:52,910
Yeah.

243
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:58,380
So, are you also thinking about divorcing Jeong Soo?

244
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:02,120
Oh, I see.

245
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:05,160
Yeah, I understand what you mean.

246
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:09,240
Yeah.

247
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:12,360
Okay, Sister-in-law. Let's talk again later.

248
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,910
Okay, take care.

249
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:22,100
What did she say? Is it confirmed?

250
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:25,190
Yeah. She said something's been nicely done.

251
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:29,180
Yeah... I guess she means I'm pregnant.

252
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:33,070
Let's go.

253
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:44,500
So what will she do?

254
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,180
Will she divorce him?

255
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:47,850
Sister-in-law said she's not going to do it.

256
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:51,080
She's asking what the problem is when they agreed to live as a DINK.

257
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:55,400
Come on. They're a married couple. Of course, this is problematic.

258
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:58,280
How can she just do that to a baby they created together?

259
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,460
And he also had a vasectomy done.

260
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:03,030
If she still got pregnant with a baby, then

261
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:04,950
this is miraculous.

262
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:06,250
How could she just—

263
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:09,360
Just? Just?

264
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,040
Just?

265
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:21,630
How would you know if she just erased the baby, or erased the baby in heartbreak?

266
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:24,250
- Did you see her? 
 - No, what I'm saying—

267
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:29,660
In your eyes, is a wife some baby carrier, not human? Huh?

268
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:33,200
It's something she needed to experience firsthand with her body.

269
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,040
Do you think there was an absence of pain and emotion?

270
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,410
Well—

271
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:39,890
- What's with you? Let me speak. 
 - (Just shut up.)

272
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:41,530
Just let them be.

273
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:43,370
I was just getting sleepy.

274
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:45,760
CEO Seo, is this entertaining to you?

275
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,240
Yes, it got me wide awake.

276
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,930
Okay, listen. A married couple—

277
00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:53,720
Everyone, be quiet. If you don't want to leave.

278
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:56,790
I want to leave.

279
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:59,910
I just need to keep talking if I want to leave?

280
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:01,830
Then...

281
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:07,640
leave through here.

282
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:13,130
I'll let you leave whether I have to fold, crumple, or break you.

283
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:14,930
Okay?

284
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:32,960
Eat up. You're not having an affair, are you?

285
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:39,450
According to Hyo Jeong, she said she smells a woman's perfume on you or something.

286
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:41,710
That's just nonsense.

287
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:44,230
You really aren't?

288
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:46,880
You know Hyo Jeong also has a lawyer cousin, right?

289
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,770
I think she's getting advice from her as well.

290
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:52,990
If you want to win, you have to be honest with me.

291
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:55,950
- I swear I am not! 
 - Then...

292
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:58,140
why do you want to divorce her?

293
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:02,110
You two married against the severe opposition of your parents because you were so in love.

294
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:06,910
You should be able to forgive an event like this one, then.

295
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:13,620
I can't help wanting to have a child.

296
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:20,000
Actually, I've been so jealous of my friends who have a child.

297
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,090
I agreed to be a DINK because of Hyo Jeong.

298
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:23,980
I didn't want to be one in the first place.

299
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:26,360
Wait, then...

300
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:32,490
you pretended to be a DINK because you liked Hyo Jeong, although you wanted a child?

301
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:41,700
When she said she had an abortion...

302
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:48,530
I thought the sky had fallen.

303
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:53,890
I don't think...

304
00:21:55,890 --> 00:21:58,480
I'll ever forget this.

305
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:05,970
So you want to get a divorce and go on your separate ways?

306
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:20,450
Let's just give up the lawsuit and convince Hyo Jeong.

307
00:22:20,450 --> 00:22:21,660
Why?

308
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:25,540
In my opinion, Hyo Jeong can't even be found responsible because

309
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:28,280
of your agreement before marriage.

310
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,790
Even if you win at court,

311
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:35,020
you'll just waste time when Hyo Jeong appeals.

312
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:43,130
You... said you want a baby.

313
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:47,460
You need to divorce as soon as possible and remarry.

314
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:57,230
I'll get going, then. Cheer up.

315
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:17,160
- What do you mean? 
 -  Getting rejected every day. 

316
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,870
- Mr. Seong! 
 -  I was a car. 
 (Same sound as "Getting rejected every day") 

317
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:20,870
Mr. Seong—

318
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:22,910
 Is that funny? 

319
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:25,130
Yes. Use one of these on a blind date!

320
00:23:25,130 --> 00:23:27,540
It's big news! I finally found out!

321
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:28,920
About what?

322
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,890
The ones dating in our office.

323
00:23:30,890 --> 00:23:33,170
- We really had one? 
 - Yes.

324
00:23:33,170 --> 00:23:34,920
Who is it?

325
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:54,250
What's this awkward kindness?

326
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:56,140
I just had a coupon.

327
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:59,460
It was about to expire. Don't misunderstand.

328
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:03,130
Thank you.

329
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:06,980
- By the way, what we talked about during the meeting earlier... 
 - Sorry?

330
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:09,530
About the DINK couple, you know.

331
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:14,130
You seemed to have a misunderstanding about me because of that.

332
00:24:14,130 --> 00:24:17,020
A misunderstanding? What kind?

333
00:24:17,670 --> 00:24:21,990
I wasn't... saying I don't feel bad for the lady at all.

334
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:25,280
I meant it would've been less tough for them both

335
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:27,810
if she had told her husband.

336
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:32,070
You seemed to have a deep misunderstanding about me.

337
00:24:34,650 --> 00:24:35,730
Okay.

338
00:24:35,730 --> 00:24:37,350
What?

339
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:40,410
I said I got it. I'll clear up the misunderstanding.

340
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:46,940
Do you have something else to say?

341
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:49,830
No, I don't. That's it.

342
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:54,870
Are you feeling sick, by the way?

343
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,260
Just not feeling well.

344
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:00,260
Hey...

345
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:02,380
It's just a hangover.

346
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:04,500
Drink less, seriously.

347
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:07,200
- Take care. 
 - Okay.

348
00:25:10,150 --> 00:25:11,470
Gosh, he scared me.

349
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:13,750
I almost lost the baby. 
  (A Korean saying that means she was startled) 

350
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:16,770
   

351
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:22,250
- It's no joke, right? 
  - Yes. 

352
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:23,620
I had a feeling.

353
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:24,570
You had a feeling?

354
00:25:24,570 --> 00:25:26,760
Yes, I have a good sense.

355
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:29,340
You should've told us sooner.

356
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:33,300
I had a feeling, but I was waiting to find solid proof.

357
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:36,440
- You're a careful one. 
 - Then, do you know this?

358
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,140
Okay. Keep this a secret.

359
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:39,840
Really?

360
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:43,250
- This is all to be kept a secret. 
 - Of course.

361
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:48,990
What's wrong?

362
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:56,470
Why are you locking the door?

363
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:09,080
What is it?

364
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:12,850
Like someone who's about to do something naughty...

365
00:26:12,850 --> 00:26:14,520
What are you up to?

366
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:15,690
Making me excited.

367
00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:18,110
What are you getting excited about?

368
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:22,700
Also... what naughty thing?

369
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:26,740
Something like...

370
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:29,850
an inappropriate act that you probably...

371
00:26:29,850 --> 00:26:32,890
shouldn't do in an office?

372
00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:37,520
What could be such an act?

373
00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:45,960
Something like this?

374
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:59,590
He has such a thick skull!

375
00:27:01,390 --> 00:27:03,480
Come follow me out.

376
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:07,620
Pack your bag when you come!

377
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:11,370
Okay!

378
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:16,110
Please leave it on my desk.

379
00:27:28,610 --> 00:27:30,450
You're here?

380
00:27:31,770 --> 00:27:34,870
Gosh, what do we do now?

381
00:27:37,770 --> 00:27:39,820
Let's go for a change of pace.

382
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:43,630
It feels like we're cutting class.

383
00:27:43,630 --> 00:27:45,810
What about your car?

384
00:27:45,810 --> 00:27:47,670
We'll need to get on one.

385
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:57,320
Two people, please.

386
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:11,330
Do you remember?

387
00:28:11,330 --> 00:28:14,900
Should I read a book or something?

388
00:28:17,610 --> 00:28:20,330
Where are we going, by the way?

389
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:24,280
Let's just go for now. Wherever it may be.

390
00:28:25,730 --> 00:28:26,970
 Let's go. 

391
00:28:26,970 --> 00:28:29,760
 Let's go! Let's go! 

392
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,480
 Let's go! 

393
00:28:33,910 --> 00:28:36,420
Tteokbokki!

394
00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:39,400
Eat everything you want to eat.

395
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:41,790
You can eat everything here.

396
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:45,770
A lingerie store?

397
00:28:45,770 --> 00:28:48,560
Forget lace. Let's go with the animal print.

398
00:28:50,390 --> 00:28:52,600
You can wear these when you come over.

399
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:55,160
Sure. Pajamas.

400
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:58,480
Will they look nice?

401
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:01,870
Cow print... or burgundy?

402
00:29:15,890 --> 00:29:19,460
What if... I get pregnant?

403
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:21,420
Why would you get pregnant?

404
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:22,970
We'll use contraceptives.

405
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:26,640
Even if you're careful... you can end up pregnant.

406
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,180
Come on.

407
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:31,840
Did you ever see me making a mistake?

408
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:40,190
A mistake?

409
00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:46,320
Why would the fruit of our love...

410
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:49,580
be called a mistake?

411
00:29:51,810 --> 00:29:54,670
Why would the fruit of love...

412
00:29:54,670 --> 00:29:56,720
be a baby?

413
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:00,170
The fruit of love is happiness.

414
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:13,350
Are you doing this on purpose by chance?

415
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:15,290
If we come home, set the mood right...

416
00:30:15,290 --> 00:30:17,810
and you suddenly do this, then you think

417
00:30:17,810 --> 00:30:21,040
I'd just agree to have a baby and just do it?

418
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:22,590
Is that what you think?

419
00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:24,820
No, I'm not.

420
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:26,180
I'm just worried about it.

421
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:28,880
What do you think of me?

422
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:33,870
Forget it. Forget it, then.

423
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:39,180
Forget it. I'm not doing it, either.

424
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:51,230
We can just have the baby if I get pregnant. Gosh...

425
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:05,200
Ha Ra,

426
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:08,040
say it one more time.

427
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,490
Say what?

428
00:31:09,490 --> 00:31:12,060
"We can just have the baby if I get pregnant."

429
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,400
Hearing that...

430
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:19,410
makes my head cool down...

431
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:22,440
helping me relax a bit.

432
00:31:26,210 --> 00:31:28,200
Don't even kiss me!

433
00:31:48,150 --> 00:31:50,700
 Think about spending the rest of our lives by ourselves. 

434
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:52,430
 Won't you be bored? 

435
00:31:52,430 --> 00:31:53,910
 You think you'd be bored? 

436
00:31:53,910 --> 00:31:55,800
 Just being with me? 

437
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,670
One Americano, please.

438
00:31:57,670 --> 00:32:00,550
I'd like a box of vanilla and chocolate.

439
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:03,820
 Sometimes, we need the crowded mood. 

440
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:07,110
 On holidays, like New Year's and Thanksgiving, with everyone. 

441
00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:10,750
 Crowded mood is just a clash of meaningless noises. 

442
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:14,930
 Holiday Syndrome was created because of those clashes. 

443
00:32:14,930 --> 00:32:18,740
 Our country's birth rate is the lowest among OECD countries. 

444
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:21,590
 Our country's about to fall because of selfish people like you. 

445
00:32:21,590 --> 00:32:24,140
- Thank you. 
 - Thank you.

446
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:28,450
 Giving birth to raise the birth rate is... 

447
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:31,410
 indeed an irresponsible behavior. 

448
00:32:31,410 --> 00:32:34,310
 Not irresponsible. It's infinitely responsible. 

449
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:36,510
 Is eros the only form of love? 

450
00:32:36,510 --> 00:32:37,860
 Infinite responsibility? 

451
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:40,710
 Are you talking about infinite meddling, 

452
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:43,660
 infinite nagging, or infinite sacrifices? 

453
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:48,810
 Hey! Isn't it a high-level emotion a person should experience once in their life? 

454
00:32:48,810 --> 00:32:50,750
 Unconditional love! 

455
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:53,430
 Another name for pushovers is parents. 

456
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:56,580
 Do you consider your mom a pushover? 

457
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:58,420
 Oh. Yeah. 

458
00:32:58,420 --> 00:33:03,970
 I wonder when my mom's going to fix her will. 

459
00:33:03,970 --> 00:33:06,660
Secure a safe distance, please...

460
00:33:11,210 --> 00:33:12,990
 Just saying. 

461
00:33:12,990 --> 00:33:15,870
 That doesn't make sense. 

462
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:21,490
I came in a cab today.

463
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:25,250
So what?

464
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:28,440
I'm just letting you know.

465
00:33:39,370 --> 00:33:43,460
This isn't about being right or wrong.

466
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:45,670
It's just a matter of difference.

467
00:33:45,670 --> 00:33:48,130
Of course, it'd be shocking for you, but

468
00:33:48,130 --> 00:33:52,320
how can two different people be happy while living together?

469
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:55,990
It'll be better for you to go your separate ways now.

470
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:03,850
In fact, getting divorced by agreement with alimony isn't a bad deal.

471
00:34:03,850 --> 00:34:07,980
If you go to trial, the alimony could be taken out altogether.

472
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:10,160
Think about it carefully.

473
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:15,590
I also don't want to go to trial.

474
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:19,050
Just apologize for saying that.

475
00:34:19,050 --> 00:34:21,370
- Then I'll break up with you. 
 - What...

476
00:34:21,370 --> 00:34:23,330
That you wasted your time because of me.

477
00:34:23,330 --> 00:34:25,820
That you shouldn't have married me.

478
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:28,850
Do you really think that way?

479
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:41,660
I'm sorry.

480
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:45,810
I got carried away by my emotions.

481
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:48,620
I don't actually think that way.

482
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:55,840
I was still happy being with you.

483
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:22,550
Mom.

484
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:26,160
Do you want me to have a baby, no matter what?

485
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:31,570
You know, everyone's having a fuss about it.

486
00:35:31,570 --> 00:35:34,830
It just makes me rethink.

487
00:35:34,830 --> 00:35:36,990
Do I have to have a baby?

488
00:35:36,990 --> 00:35:38,290
Aren't you going to marry?

489
00:35:38,290 --> 00:35:40,420
No... Even if you marry—

490
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:42,490
Why would you marry, then?

491
00:35:42,490 --> 00:35:44,810
Just live alone.

492
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:51,100
You want to live with your loved one but you might not want a baby.

493
00:35:51,810 --> 00:35:53,790
Are you seeing someone lately?

494
00:35:53,790 --> 00:35:55,950
When you were talking to Auntie two days ago,

495
00:35:55,950 --> 00:35:58,910
you were with someone, I heard.

496
00:35:58,910 --> 00:36:01,280
She said you seem to be dating someone.

497
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:03,820
Did the guy say he doesn't want a baby?

498
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:05,040
No, not at all.

499
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:07,230
Oh, my... My goodness, look at you.

500
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:09,370
I guess it's true.

501
00:36:09,370 --> 00:36:13,660
Well, it's not... exactly like that...

502
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:16,530
We're just having talks...

503
00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:17,840
about living like that...

504
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,380
You can't!

505
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:21,480
Break up with a guy like that!

506
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,320
He's a selfish one.

507
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:27,320
He just doesn't want responsibility. No need to know more.

508
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:30,920
What does he do, by the way?

509
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:33,900
Oh, my. Oh, my goodness. Look at the time...

510
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:36,390
I should get going. I'm going, Mom.

511
00:36:36,390 --> 00:36:37,430
Seriously...

512
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:40,390
- I'm busy. So busy. 
 - Gosh, you...

513
00:36:40,390 --> 00:36:42,100
You do have someone.

514
00:36:58,790 --> 00:37:02,640
Did you tell her you're seeing me again?

515
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,500
I didn't.

516
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:07,840
Are you worried?

517
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:48,970
Did he come back to me?

518
00:39:54,290 --> 00:39:56,370
We're back together again.

519
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:17,240
Huh?

520
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:21,970
Huh?

521
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:43,650
I got backstabbed by Hyo Jeong.

522
00:40:43,650 --> 00:40:46,420
She changed the lease from yearly to monthly behind your back

523
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:50,660
and left 2,000 won out of 200 million won security deposit?

524
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:51,750
Yes.

525
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:53,890
She also took all the electronics and furniture that were dowries?

526
00:40:53,890 --> 00:40:56,090
That's what I'm saying.

527
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:00,100
Is she allowed to do this, though?

528
00:41:04,310 --> 00:41:06,790
Tell him to consider it alimony.

529
00:41:06,790 --> 00:41:10,710
Since he harmed my body and heart... as he pleases.

530
00:41:10,710 --> 00:41:11,780
Wait...

531
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:16,220
Didn't we agree last time to break up nicely without trouble?

532
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:21,690
Were you buying time to pocket all the assets?

533
00:41:21,690 --> 00:41:23,220
How can you backstab like this?

534
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:25,380
Backstab?

535
00:41:26,130 --> 00:41:29,020
Lee Jeong Soo backstabbed me first!

536
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:31,850
What? Vasectomy reversal?

537
00:41:31,850 --> 00:41:33,420
Oh, my!

538
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:35,320
What in the world, seriously?

539
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:37,540
Wait!  So the baby wasn't conceived by miracle,

540
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:41,060
but because he undid it without letting the wife know?

541
00:41:41,710 --> 00:41:44,210
Gosh, that's really scary.

542
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:46,140
Isn't that almost a crime?

543
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:48,260
Honestly, when I heard this,

544
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:50,530
I knew something was off.

545
00:41:50,530 --> 00:41:52,420
It's such a slim chance.

546
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:54,420
She wouldn't be getting pregnant like that.

547
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:58,270
Why didn't you say anything earlier? You kept quiet before.

548
00:41:58,270 --> 00:42:01,870
I don't speak up unless I'm certain about something.

549
00:42:01,870 --> 00:42:06,210
I'm not the type to run my mouth first like you.

550
00:42:06,210 --> 00:42:07,690
Whoa! You're eating squid.

551
00:42:07,690 --> 00:42:11,120
I heard you became a vegetarian, but you keep eating squid.

552
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:14,940
I was a lacto-ovo vegetarian...

553
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:16,700
Lacto... Lacto, what?

554
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:18,830
Lacto-ovo vegetarian.

555
00:42:18,830 --> 00:42:21,510
They still eat eggs and dairy.

556
00:42:21,510 --> 00:42:25,220
But I switched to pescetarianism because it was too hard.

557
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:28,320
Anyhow, is it something you can just change like that?

558
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:30,540
Gosh, why do you care?

559
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:33,740
Did you help with my vegetarianism or something?

560
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:35,610
It's already hard as it is.

561
00:42:35,610 --> 00:42:38,960
I'm just asking. Why are you getting mad?

562
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:45,250
- What's wrong with her? 
 - What's wrong?

563
00:42:45,250 --> 00:42:46,390
She ate this.

564
00:42:46,390 --> 00:42:47,910
What's that? What's wrong with her?

565
00:42:47,910 --> 00:42:50,460
Is she feeling sick?

566
00:42:53,590 --> 00:42:55,830
- Gastritis! 
 - Gastritis?

567
00:42:55,830 --> 00:42:57,330
It's gastritis...

568
00:42:57,330 --> 00:43:00,450
Does severe gastritis cause vomiting?

569
00:43:00,450 --> 00:43:02,130
Eat up, please.

570
00:43:02,130 --> 00:43:04,850
Excuse me. I'm going to the restroom.

571
00:43:08,110 --> 00:43:09,800
Are you okay?

572
00:43:12,750 --> 00:43:14,400
Yes.

573
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:17,690
Your face is looking pale.

574
00:43:17,690 --> 00:43:19,170
I heard you have gastritis.

575
00:43:19,170 --> 00:43:21,740
Was that medicine from last time for gastritis and not hangovers?

576
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:23,980
It's not like that. Don't mind me.

577
00:43:23,980 --> 00:43:26,570
I can't even worry about you?

578
00:43:32,570 --> 00:43:34,890
Why would you worry about me?

579
00:43:34,890 --> 00:43:37,050
Did I ask you to worry about me?

580
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:39,130
You just stay still.

581
00:43:39,130 --> 00:43:42,090
You staying still is helping me.

582
00:43:47,670 --> 00:43:50,300
Treating me like a sworn foe...

583
00:43:54,580 --> 00:43:57,930
Is the sister-in-law also appointing a lawyer?

584
00:43:57,930 --> 00:43:59,540
She already did.

585
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:01,800
She has a cousin who's a lawyer.

586
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:07,250
We talked on the phone earlier, and it seems we might go to trial.

587
00:44:07,250 --> 00:44:09,130
You'll go to trial if you must.

588
00:44:09,130 --> 00:44:12,260
You can't give the entire 200 million won as alimony.

589
00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:13,640
That's true.

590
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:16,720
By the way, which firm does her lawyer work at?

591
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:18,480
It's Moon and Jin.

592
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:19,860
Attorney Goh Eun.

593
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:23,040
Moon and Jin's Goh Eun?

594
00:44:24,750 --> 00:44:27,580
There's a fight waiting to happen.

595
00:44:31,250 --> 00:44:32,810
My name is Oh Ha Ra.

596
00:44:32,810 --> 00:44:34,560
Please take a seat.

597
00:44:35,510 --> 00:44:39,250
You were at Pacific before you were scouted here. Right?

598
00:44:39,250 --> 00:44:41,770
One of our employees said he knows you.

599
00:44:41,770 --> 00:44:43,840
- His name is Seong Chan Young— 
 - I'm not sure.

600
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:46,190
I don't have an interest in anything besides work.

601
00:44:46,190 --> 00:44:48,740
So I don't really remember people.

602
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:51,310
I see.

603
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:53,900
Please suggest your agreement.

604
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:56,670
We're done with ours, but

605
00:44:56,670 --> 00:45:00,390
let's hear what you brought first.

606
00:45:00,390 --> 00:45:04,420
Let's try to come up with a conclusion today since we're both busy.

607
00:45:04,420 --> 00:45:05,920
Sure, let's do that.

608
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:09,150
This is our agreement proposal.

609
00:45:27,570 --> 00:45:28,920
Ye Seul, I totally saw you shopping.

610
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:31,030
I'm not!

611
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:44,060
 Are you feeling sick, by the way? 

612
00:45:44,060 --> 00:45:46,410
 Just not feeling well. 

613
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:47,380
 Hey... 

614
00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:49,840
 It's a hangover. 

615
00:46:03,570 --> 00:46:06,250
   

616
00:46:14,350 --> 00:46:18,080
 Unwanted pregnancy is the same as bodily harm. 

617
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:23,530
You know that stealthing, secretly removing contraceptives during sex,

618
00:46:23,530 --> 00:46:26,760
is starting to be put into the law as sexual assault abroad. Right?

619
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:30,400
- However, in Korea— 
 - There is no clear law, but

620
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:32,560
congress is putting in efforts to pass the law and

621
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:35,790
the Supreme Court is also acknowledging its cause.

622
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:39,650
In the case of Hyo Jeong, she suffered so much emotional damage

623
00:46:39,650 --> 00:46:42,810
that it's more than possible to prove PTSD.

624
00:46:42,810 --> 00:46:44,530
Do you want to go on an all-out war

625
00:46:44,530 --> 00:46:46,690
on divorce, civil, and criminal

626
00:46:46,690 --> 00:46:50,570
the triple lawsuit fronts?

627
00:46:50,570 --> 00:46:54,470
Or will you end it with an alimony of 200 million won?

628
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:17,430
Even if you file a separate civil lawsuit...

629
00:47:17,430 --> 00:47:20,690
there will be no profit because the alimony part will overlap.

630
00:47:20,690 --> 00:47:23,320
Even if you file a criminal lawsuit,

631
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:26,490
it isn't easy to get pregnancy itself as bodily harm.

632
00:47:26,490 --> 00:47:28,710
They're a couple in a marriage, and

633
00:47:28,710 --> 00:47:31,940
there was no assault or blackmailing, nor was it unwanted intercourse.

634
00:47:31,940 --> 00:47:35,370
What crime are you going to identify it as?

635
00:47:35,370 --> 00:47:38,000
Punishments for unwanted pregnancy caused by

636
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,000
stealthing or sexual assault, of course,

637
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,930
should be legalized for higher severity.

638
00:47:43,930 --> 00:47:47,410
But at the current state, punishing this as bodily harm...

639
00:47:47,410 --> 00:47:50,180
would be too much to ask for when you

640
00:47:50,180 --> 00:47:54,320
look at its relevance with other laws and

641
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:56,450
its balance with the rest of the legal system.

642
00:47:58,380 --> 00:48:00,760
Whether it's too much or not...

643
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:02,740
let us take it to court, then.

644
00:48:02,740 --> 00:48:03,810
Are you done talking?

645
00:48:03,810 --> 00:48:06,350
I'm sure we're not the only ones at a loss if this goes to court.

646
00:48:06,350 --> 00:48:09,210
We can go and find out.

647
00:48:18,790 --> 00:48:20,300
   

648
00:48:23,630 --> 00:48:26,160
You can take it. It's okay.

649
00:48:27,710 --> 00:48:29,990
I apologize. One moment, please.

650
00:48:33,070 --> 00:48:34,760
Yes, Son.

651
00:48:35,670 --> 00:48:37,790
I'm working right now. What is it?

652
00:48:40,450 --> 00:48:42,400
What were you doing?

653
00:48:48,460 --> 00:48:49,990
Hey...

654
00:48:49,990 --> 00:48:51,830
Did Attorney Kang go somewhere? She's not in her room.

655
00:48:51,830 --> 00:48:54,040
Oh, Attorney Kang took the day off.

656
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:55,620
She said she was not feeling well at all.

657
00:48:55,620 --> 00:48:57,220
Is that so?

658
00:49:07,100 --> 00:49:09,490
I apologize. My son got hurt.

659
00:49:09,490 --> 00:49:10,710
Oh my, I'm sorry.

660
00:49:10,710 --> 00:49:13,410
Shouldn't you go to him, then?

661
00:49:13,410 --> 00:49:14,810
It's okay.

662
00:49:14,810 --> 00:49:16,530
Thank you.

663
00:49:17,350 --> 00:49:19,560
Where were we again?

664
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:22,120
Excuse me...

665
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:24,530
I'm just...

666
00:49:24,530 --> 00:49:27,270
I'm just asking you this.

667
00:49:27,940 --> 00:49:31,760
Have you ever regretted having a child?

668
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:33,810
I mean...

669
00:49:33,810 --> 00:49:35,210
If you work here,

670
00:49:35,210 --> 00:49:38,560
I'm sure there's a lot of competition and a heavy workload.

671
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:42,630
I was just wondering if it's not too tough for you.

672
00:49:45,660 --> 00:49:49,430
Of course, I regretted it.

673
00:49:49,430 --> 00:49:52,750
It's indeed hard for me.

674
00:49:52,750 --> 00:49:56,460
However... no one told me...

675
00:49:56,460 --> 00:50:01,430
I don't have to marry or give birth...

676
00:50:01,430 --> 00:50:03,590
10 years ago.

677
00:50:03,590 --> 00:50:06,660
I thought it was natural to just do those things.

678
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:12,000
Had I known what this is like...

679
00:50:12,020 --> 00:50:15,250
in its entirety at first...

680
00:50:15,250 --> 00:50:17,940
I wouldn't have made this mistake.

681
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:21,410
A mistake, you say?

682
00:50:21,410 --> 00:50:23,430
Let's say it was...

683
00:50:23,430 --> 00:50:26,900
the most beautiful mistake in my life.

684
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:29,600
One you'll never make had you known about it.

685
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:36,850
Have you ever suggested...

686
00:50:36,850 --> 00:50:40,860
to Sister-in-law to have a baby, by any chance?

687
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:43,680
Of course not.

688
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:47,330
What I think is my opinion.

689
00:50:47,330 --> 00:50:51,780
Hyo Jeong has the right to live the life she wants.

690
00:50:51,780 --> 00:50:54,060
As far as the issue of giving birth...

691
00:50:54,100 --> 00:50:58,790
it's not like there's a set answer about what's better.

692
00:51:04,470 --> 00:51:06,050
Shall we get back to work now?

693
00:51:06,050 --> 00:51:09,130
I need to get off work early, so there's not much time.

694
00:51:09,130 --> 00:51:12,710
We don't have much time, and we said what we needed to say.

695
00:51:12,710 --> 00:51:15,980
Shall we conclude things now?

696
00:51:15,980 --> 00:51:18,650
Then the conclusion is...

697
00:51:18,650 --> 00:51:21,130
Let's just go to trial.

698
00:51:21,130 --> 00:51:22,790
No matter how I look at it,

699
00:51:22,790 --> 00:51:27,230
I don't think Jeong Soo will be sentenced to pay up 200 million won.

700
00:51:30,470 --> 00:51:32,560
It was a pleasure to meet you.

701
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:35,030
Let us meet at court.

702
00:51:45,350 --> 00:51:47,610
What a nice view.

703
00:52:14,030 --> 00:52:17,540
I have about 30 more minutes.

704
00:52:17,540 --> 00:52:19,810
Will 30 minutes be enough?

705
00:52:19,810 --> 00:52:23,210
You and Sister-in-law's stances seemed pretty firm.

706
00:52:23,210 --> 00:52:24,890
Let's redo the negotiation.

707
00:52:24,890 --> 00:52:27,570
It might end faster than you think.

708
00:52:29,340 --> 00:52:30,960
Let's go.

709
00:52:35,430 --> 00:52:40,150
   

710
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:45,250
How did you bring it down to 50 million won from 200 million won?

711
00:52:45,250 --> 00:52:48,030
That amount was too much in the first place.

712
00:52:49,850 --> 00:52:51,390
Anyhow, thank you, Sis.

713
00:52:51,390 --> 00:52:55,100
Although... 50 million won isn't a small amount, either,

714
00:52:55,100 --> 00:52:58,620
but since you say this is the minimum...

715
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:05,300
Hey, that 50 million won is the minimum consequence for

716
00:53:05,300 --> 00:53:08,610
trying to satisfy your greed by betraying someone you loved.

717
00:53:08,610 --> 00:53:10,700
Don't even think much of it.

718
00:53:10,700 --> 00:53:12,740
Thank goodness it wasn't put into law yet.

719
00:53:12,740 --> 00:53:16,800
If you were found guilty of stealthing, you'd be sued for criminal law violation right away!

720
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:18,000
Do you understand?

721
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,650
Okay, I got it.

722
00:53:20,650 --> 00:53:23,130
I'll get going now.

723
00:53:26,970 --> 00:53:28,690
Lee Jeong Soo.

724
00:53:28,690 --> 00:53:30,170
Yes?

725
00:53:31,780 --> 00:53:36,150
You might... forget about this after time passes,

726
00:53:36,150 --> 00:53:38,460
but Hyo Jeong will never be able to forget.

727
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:43,090
Sincerely apologize to Hyo Jeong.

728
00:53:46,290 --> 00:53:49,710
Okay. I'll make sure to do that.

729
00:53:49,710 --> 00:53:52,210
I'm going to call her and check.

730
00:53:53,670 --> 00:53:55,410
I'll be off.

731
00:54:09,170 --> 00:54:12,700
Those two were really in love with each other.

732
00:54:12,700 --> 00:54:16,060
They barely got married against everyone's opposition.

733
00:54:16,060 --> 00:54:20,270
I can't believe they fell apart in pieces like this.

734
00:54:20,270 --> 00:54:23,450
Isn't it because they were DINK?

735
00:54:23,450 --> 00:54:24,810
Come on, that can't be.

736
00:54:24,810 --> 00:54:27,100
Do people with children never divorce?

737
00:54:27,100 --> 00:54:31,480
That's not it, but how easy is it to divorce without a child?

738
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:34,760
A man and woman are done soon after the love cools down.

739
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:38,280
Look at those two. Gosh, the guy was saying he'll

740
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:41,010
give up having a baby and love her only when he was in love.

741
00:54:41,010 --> 00:54:42,780
After his love cooled down,

742
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:46,880
he changed his heart right away and betrayed her.

743
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:50,010
Using a child as glue for two people not to break up...

744
00:54:50,010 --> 00:54:51,870
that's a terrible thing to do to a child.

745
00:54:51,870 --> 00:54:53,920
Isn't everyone becoming a miserable existence?

746
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:56,360
There are also families who live well.

747
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:57,940
- Not divorcing. 
 - I see.

748
00:54:57,940 --> 00:55:02,460
Couples who live in hell but endure it for the child?

749
00:55:02,460 --> 00:55:05,220
There are many, indeed.

750
00:55:05,220 --> 00:55:08,130
- Sorry for coming late. 
 - Hello.

751
00:55:08,130 --> 00:55:10,300
A person can be late sometimes. I'm not sorry.

752
00:55:10,300 --> 00:55:13,840
Whoa... CEOs... a matching outfit?

753
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:16,220
Whoa, how did you know?

754
00:55:16,220 --> 00:55:19,580
You're the keenest after you started working here, Ms. Jeon.

755
00:55:19,580 --> 00:55:23,030
Be careful. I've got a better lead than you think.

756
00:55:23,030 --> 00:55:26,470
Stop being silly, and let's start the meeting.

757
00:55:26,470 --> 00:55:30,250
- Okay. 
 - Whoa, you're keen.

758
00:55:42,010 --> 00:55:44,420
Yes, I'll count on that.

759
00:55:56,020 --> 00:55:57,800
Gosh, you scared me.

760
00:55:57,800 --> 00:55:59,360
Let's have a word.

761
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:02,210
Go ahead.

762
00:56:03,100 --> 00:56:05,320
You're pregnant, Noona.

763
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:08,620
The meds you were taking were for morning sickness.

764
00:56:12,430 --> 00:56:14,350
Is it my baby?

765
00:56:17,750 --> 00:56:19,600
What the heck. No.

766
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:22,530
I think it is, considering the time frame.

767
00:56:22,530 --> 00:56:24,680
- I said it isn't. 
 - Are you saying...

768
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:27,040
you slept with another man at that time?

769
00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:30,930
Is that right?

770
00:56:34,590 --> 00:56:35,870
Why do you care?

771
00:56:35,870 --> 00:56:37,410
- Answer me. 
 - Why should I?

772
00:56:37,410 --> 00:56:40,720
No matter how I think about it, I think it's my baby.

773
00:56:43,510 --> 00:56:46,580
It isn't. I said it isn't. It really isn't.

774
00:56:46,580 --> 00:56:48,580
Did you sleep with another man?

775
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:51,630
Just answer that question.

776
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:01,410
- Let's just say I did— 
 - Tell me clearly!

777
00:57:01,410 --> 00:57:03,190
If you say you did, I won't ask anymore.

778
00:57:03,190 --> 00:57:06,950
I won't bother you anymore. Just answer that.

779
00:57:10,450 --> 00:57:12,840
Yes, I slept with another man.

780
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:14,380
That's a lie.

781
00:57:15,660 --> 00:57:18,790
If you slept with another man, you wouldn't answer me so willingly like this.

782
00:57:18,790 --> 00:57:22,000
You'd beat me up, go crazy, saying you'll sue me for defamation.

783
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:25,290
You'd tell me to mind my own business. I'd be half dead already.

784
00:57:25,290 --> 00:57:27,500
You answer me so nicely...

785
00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:30,350
because you're lying to me.

786
00:57:30,350 --> 00:57:34,750
I'm right, aren't I? This is why you're so annoyed and on the edge

787
00:57:34,750 --> 00:57:37,560
whenever you saw me lately, isn't it?

788
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:41,620
Hey...

789
00:57:41,620 --> 00:57:43,420
It must've been so hard alone.

790
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:46,860
You should've told me sooner.

791
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:11,280
All right. It is your baby. Yes.

792
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:13,390
What are you going to do?

793
00:58:13,390 --> 00:58:15,230
I'll take responsibility.

794
00:58:17,790 --> 00:58:19,580
Take responsibility for what?

795
00:58:19,580 --> 00:58:21,580
I'll take responsibility.

796
00:58:24,710 --> 00:58:27,240
- You... 
 - Let's get married.

797
00:58:37,090 --> 00:58:40,330
You seemed to be in a bad mood all day today.

798
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:45,410
There's Jeong Soo's thing and...

799
00:58:48,210 --> 00:58:52,100
I think I'll need to make up my mind now.

800
00:58:54,940 --> 00:58:56,480
Did you?

801
00:59:00,250 --> 00:59:03,550
Hey, why are you so serious? It's making me nervous.

802
00:59:04,460 --> 00:59:06,270
You're nervous?

803
00:59:08,560 --> 00:59:10,500
I'm not confident.

804
00:59:11,580 --> 00:59:13,050
Why?

805
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:18,060
It feels like...

806
00:59:18,060 --> 00:59:21,050
I'm making you do something you shouldn't.

807
00:59:22,300 --> 00:59:27,200
Shall we give it some more thought, then?

808
00:59:31,540 --> 00:59:34,560
I'm less sure the more I think about it.

809
00:59:34,560 --> 00:59:41,080
Will I be able to... be happy even if I don't have a child?

810
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:47,820
Will we...

811
00:59:49,690 --> 00:59:55,140
be able to be happy... even when we have a child, Ha Ra?

812
01:00:15,370 --> 01:00:17,970
Wait!  Who do we have here?

813
01:00:21,120 --> 01:00:22,830
Mom...

814
01:00:25,710 --> 01:00:28,450
She was the lady...

815
01:00:29,620 --> 01:00:31,750
you said you're seeing?

816
01:00:44,510 --> 01:00:54,920


817
01:00:57,620 --> 01:00:59,670
♫  It didn't feel like much  ♫

818
01:00:59,670 --> 01:01:01,810
 How can we get married? 

819
01:01:01,810 --> 01:01:02,930
 What is this? 

820
01:01:02,930 --> 01:01:04,680
 Do we have to give up the child? 

821
01:01:04,680 --> 01:01:07,590
 For Mother, she used the means she could use. 

822
01:01:07,590 --> 01:01:10,790
 Promise me before you go. Say you'll break up with Ha Ra today. 

823
01:01:10,790 --> 01:01:11,960
 I'm sorry. 

824
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:14,760
 Unni, you know, Eun Beom and I... 

825
01:01:14,760 --> 01:01:17,580
 Don't you have a final resort that can turn the tables here? 

826
01:01:17,580 --> 01:01:19,450
 The one who loves more should just go for it. 

827
01:01:19,450 --> 01:01:21,050
 I'm really sorry, but... 

828
01:01:21,050 --> 01:01:23,360
 could you quit working here, Si Wook? 

829
01:01:23,360 --> 01:01:26,570
 To be honest, there's one more thing I didn't tell you. 

830
01:01:26,570 --> 01:01:30,830
