1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,040


2
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:12,180
   

3
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:13,380
   

4
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:36,020
   

5
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:41,550
   

6
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:43,670
   

7
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:44,490
   
   

8
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:03,220
You still have that habit?

9
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:09,180
I almost froze to death.

10
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:21,840
 They're finished. 

11
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:24,600
 Completely. 

12
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:30,930
 My mom and dad are... really complete strangers now. 

13
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:34,160
 When we divorced... 

14
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:38,480
 I hoped you'd be the most miserable person in the world. 

15
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:43,600
 But why is my life going downhill? 

16
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,440
 This is all because of you. 

17
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:23,470
 It's because of you! 

18
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:35,140
 Hey, Oh Ha Ra, you need to go home. 

19
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:37,320
 - Are you going to sleep here? 
 - Yes. 

20
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,550
 I'm going to sleep here. 

21
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:40,030
 You must be crazy! 

22
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:41,750
 Hey, you need to sleep at home. 

23
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:43,150
 You'll freeze to death! 

24
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:45,810
 I might as well freeze to death. 

25
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:49,390
 I'm going to freeze and die... 

26
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:56,880
 You can freeze and die, then. I'm going home alone. 

27
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,690
 Hey! 

28
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:02,560
 Take care. 

29
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:06,610
 Bye-bye. 

30
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:10,190
 Get on my back. 

31
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:12,550
 Gosh, seriously... 

32
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:57,080
Are you sleeping?

33
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:03,560
Why? You can't sleep?

34
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,310
Yes.

35
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,460
Why?

36
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:17,820
I don't know. I'm awake now.

37
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:24,050
Try to get back to sleep.

38
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:28,950
Hey...

39
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:34,310
So, nothing comes to your mind when I'm next to you?

40
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:42,580
This can't do. I should just go home. I should go.

41
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:45,080
I was just kidding.

42
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,050
Did that even sound funny to you?

43
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:49,490
Okay.

44
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:51,670
I take it back.

45
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:54,910
You're not sober yet.

46
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:57,500
Your clothes aren't dry, either.

47
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:03,710
Do you...

48
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:08,060
want to do it?

49
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:20,800
 So you're saying he took you to a hotel, 

50
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,930
got you completely naked,

51
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:25,120
then completely washed you,

52
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,130
and then put you to sleep?

53
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:33,170
Whoa, being your ex-husband is an extreme job.

54
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:37,710
By the way... Never mind.

55
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:39,200
- What? 
 - It's nothing.

56
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:42,180
Gosh, what is it?

57
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:44,910
I mean, since you said he was naked...

58
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:47,930
I was going to ask if you really only slept.

59
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:50,610
But when I think about it, you puked on his clothes.

60
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:53,690
So he couldn't really sleep in those clothes.

61
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:55,230
I was wondering what you'd say.

62
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:59,140
Gosh, but it's still unnatural for nothing to have happened

63
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:02,020
when a grown man and woman were in the same bed.

64
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:04,250
Think about it.

65
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,520
A man and a woman lying in the same bed...

66
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,740
and history can be written down overnight...

67
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:10,140
Oh, right...

68
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:13,290
The problem is the man being Goo Eun Beom.

69
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:17,880
He seemed to have no interest in writing that history.

70
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,580
Tell me honestly.

71
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:22,430
- Did you sleep with him? 
 - Yes.

72
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:24,320
I did. I did just that.

73
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:27,240
He had a deep sleep, not waking up even once.

74
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:30,280
Gosh, you two are made of stones.

75
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,600
That's what I'm saying.

76
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:37,960
Okay, Oh Ha Ra...

77
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,740
I know your life is tough and you're lonely.

78
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:44,160
However, no matter how I think, Goo isn't right.

79
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:49,110
Why do you say Goo Eun Beom isn't right?

80
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:52,490
Okay, everything's fine and all, but...

81
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:55,740
Let's give this a careful review.

82
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:59,750
About why it must be Goo Eun Beom.

83
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:04,430
Just because?

84
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:09,260
Just because.

85
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:14,350
Is that not enough?

86
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:16,390
It's enough.

87
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:18,170
Fighting.

88
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:22,020
What was that? That's it?

89
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:24,180
Fighting!

90
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:43,050
I'm sorry for coming suddenly.

91
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:44,450
Were you surprised?

92
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:47,140
I can't say I wasn't.

93
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:54,310
I thought we needed to have a proper talk in person.

94
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,860
I'm sorry.

95
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:03,320
I'm sure you were disheartened because of me all this time, but

96
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:06,350
you thought of me first, which I'm thankful for.

97
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:08,720
I don't regret meeting you, Jae Gyeom.

98
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,960
I didn't hate it at all.

99
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:14,240
If you didn't hate it, then you didn't particularly like it, either?

100
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,230
N-No...

101
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:18,480
Wh-What I meant was thatâ€”

102
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,200
I know. I was joking.

103
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,020
You know...

104
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:33,580
I still thought that I was a good person.

105
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:36,330
But I only now realized...

106
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:41,100
that I can also be the worse experience for someone.

107
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:46,950
Generally, people are... either complicated or evil according to someone.

108
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:50,200
I guess it's true.

109
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:53,080
Ha Ra...

110
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:57,200
I don't regret meeting you.

111
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:06,370
Could I ask you for a favor since it's the last time?

112
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:12,550
I want you to be honest with yourself.

113
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:17,500
In any situation or in making any decision.

114
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:23,940
You go and find the answer yourself.

115
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,160
As it's the last time,

116
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:39,160
let's shake hands.

117
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,710
I wish you the best.

118
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,800
You, too.

119
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:07,920
Wait, so...

120
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:13,170
you're suing your father's mistress for damages?

121
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:15,410
And you're even doing it yourself?

122
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:16,550
Yes.

123
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:20,940
My mother said you avoid poop because it's dirty,

124
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:23,050
not because it's scary. So she doesn't want to do it.

125
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:25,610
So I need to do it myself, at least.

126
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:28,360
Seeking justice.

127
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,020
Will you be okay?

128
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:33,620
How can a daughter sue her father's mistress? Does that make sense?

129
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:36,580
Why do you think it doesn't make sense?

130
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:39,210
I looked it up and saw a lower-court precedent.

131
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:45,040
A mother and her sons sued a mistress for damages and won.

132
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:48,620
Although they didn't get much alimony.

133
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:51,360
Anyhow, this is Attorney Oh's family matter.

134
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:55,000
So why don't we let her do it if she wants to?

135
00:13:55,730 --> 00:13:56,940
Gosh, all right.

136
00:13:56,940 --> 00:14:00,010
If you really want to do it, give it a try.

137
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:01,000
Thank you.

138
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,510
Oh, next. Attorney Goo how are the trial progressions going?

139
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:08,470
The prosecution wants to ask Kim Eui Cheol's widow to testify as hearsay. 
    

140
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:09,940
Tomorrow's the examination date. 
    

141
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:11,720
Why didn't you stop it if it's hearsay?

142
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:14,250
- Is it okay? 
 - How could it possibly be okay?

143
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:16,530
I did my best to stop it, but

144
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:21,270
the court accepted the prosecution's claim that this case was an exception since the victim died.

145
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:23,440
Okay, then.

146
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,430
What's the testimony about?

147
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:28,580
Looks like she's going to claim Kim Ga Eun to be a stalker, not a mistress.

148
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:30,300
A stalker?

149
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:33,230
What kind of a scenario is that?

150
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:34,860
Something like how Kim Ga Eun secretly gave birth and

151
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:37,870
held onto his ankle when it could've been just a one-night fling.

152
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:40,280
- After which, she kept making threats... 
   - I see.. 

153
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:43,080
 - Held onto his ankle.  
 - That she followed him around.

154
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,460
 - Ankle...  
 - If she's painted as a stalker, then it'll get intense...

155
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:46,830
 - Ankle?  
 - If the court accepts that...

156
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:49,470
 Is that why he didn't sleep with me? In fear of me holding onto his ankle? 

157
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:52,140
Right. It'll be a big problem.

158
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:54,620
How dare you think of me like that!

159
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:02,450
What's wrong with her?

160
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:07,270
Well...

161
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:11,270
Kim Ga Eun isn't someone who'd do that.

162
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:15,330
Make sure to defend her, please.

163
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:19,620
Okay.

164
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:21,150
Sure.

165
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:24,550
What's this?

166
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:28,090
What the heck?

167
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:35,920
Next, Attorney Kwon. How's the trial going?

168
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,500
Oh, the trial I told you about yesterday

169
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,170
will be wrapped up tomorrow without a hitch.

170
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:41,030
How unusual.

171
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:44,150
Thank you for your time.

172
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:47,360
- Let's do some work. 
 - Okay.

173
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,170
Oh, right, Unniâ€”

174
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:56,000
Did you change your cologne?

175
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:11,120
Why does he avoid me?

176
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,910
Did I do something to him?

177
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:17,630
This is absurd. Who does he think he is?

178
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,540
 Heyâ€” 

179
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:27,200
 The transcript of a conversation with the direct participation of the involved party isn't illegal evidence. 

180
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,060
 You know that, right? 

181
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:38,000
 Why would you worry about me? 

182
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:05,570
Oh, my! Gosh, I must be crazy!

183
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:10,920
You even tried to kill yourself because...

184
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:13,230
your heartache was unbearable?

185
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:15,060
Yes.

186
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:17,160
Are you saying you couldn't help but

187
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:19,360
remain silent, although you knew about

188
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:25,200
- the relationship between your late husband and his mistress? 
 - Yes.

189
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,490
According to what you said...

190
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:31,540
Kim Eui Cheol must've been under

191
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:35,640
great mental pain because of his mistress and her child.

192
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,800
Yes.

193
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:42,770
However, why did your late husband fail to cut off ties with his mistress?

194
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:46,050
Why did he maintain this quasi-marital relationship?

195
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:49,150
That woman kept threatening my husband.

196
00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:50,910
Saying she'll kill him.

197
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:54,220
Your Honor, although she's giving a permitted hearsay testimony,

198
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:56,240
her statement just now clearly aims to frameâ€”

199
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:59,460
I'd like to also submit evidence of the witness' statement.

200
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:02,750
Submitting evidence that hasn't been agreed upon in advance isâ€”

201
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:04,890
The witness' broken phone was only repaired yesterday,

202
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:06,830
so we couldn't help but submit them today.

203
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:09,490
It's a conversation between the witness and her older sister about

204
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:12,280
the testimony more than one year ago.

205
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:15,640
   

206
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:24,080
If your husband was in such pain as you said, Witness,

207
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:28,620
why wouldn't there be any evidence supporting such suffering?

208
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:31,820
It must've been quite severe if he had attempted to kill himself.

209
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:35,400
Didn't he try going to the hospital?

210
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:39,180
- I don't know. 
 - Okay.

211
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:42,110
To answer that question for you,

212
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:48,530
Kim Eui Cheol has no record of going to the hospital because of a mental illness.

213
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:52,790
I couldn't know that much.

214
00:18:55,050 --> 00:19:00,190
Witness, do you love your husband?

215
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:03,350
- Sorry? 
 - Do you love him?

216
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:13,180
Of course, I do.

217
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:17,440
Or I did.

218
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:23,480
Did your deceased husband also love you, in your opinion?

219
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:26,060
Of course.

220
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:28,600
I see.

221
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,750
   

222
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:33,380
   

223
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:38,670
Article 316 of the Criminal Procedure Act, Exceptions to Hearsay Testimony.

224
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:41,150
If the statement of a witness other than the defendant on the trial date contains

225
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:44,070
the statement of another person other than the defendant,

226
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:48,520
unless the original witness is unable to testify due to death or equally severe reasons,

227
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:54,120
the statements of such witnesses can only be accepted under the understanding that

228
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,490
the testimony was given under credible circumstances.

229
00:19:56,490 --> 00:19:59,900
Defendant Representative, I'm aware of that as well.

230
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:02,750
We agreed to accept because Kim Eui Cheol died.

231
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:07,620
Yes, however, it can't be proven that the testimony has been

232
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:10,370
made under credible circumstances, can it?

233
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:14,210
The witness testified that the primary witness and herself were in a happy marriage.

234
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:17,630
In that case, we can't rule out the possibility of Kim Eui Cheol

235
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:21,460
- lying to avoid getting a divorce. 
 - Your Honorâ€”

236
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:24,140
Therefore, the witness' testimony can't be deemed credible. 
    

237
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:27,350
I'd like to request the withdrawal of the witness again.

238
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:30,790
   

239
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:32,910
   

240
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:39,530
For now... we'll take the testimony and the evidence.

241
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:43,620
The judges will be the ones to determine their credibility

242
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:46,270
according to the principle of free evaluation.

243
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:47,840
Yes, Your Honor.

244
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:56,490
Yes, Mom. How is it living with Auntie?

245
00:20:58,330 --> 00:21:01,590
That's great. The sisters get to spend time together for the first time in a while.

246
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:05,460
Yes. Let me know if you need anything.

247
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:08,570
Okay, I'll be there soon. Okay.

248
00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:13,190
   

249
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:25,800
   

250
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:36,130
Do you have to go through with this lawsuit?

251
00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:39,360
- I'm sure it'll be dismissed. 
 - Why?

252
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,790
There's not a single letter from a doctor.

253
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:44,710
How are you going to prove emotional damage?

254
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:49,620
Could you testify for it, CEO Hong?

255
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:52,220
Say that my work performance has been poor.

256
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:54,440
And so you reduced my pay.

257
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:56,670
I didn't reduce it, though. Are you telling me to lie under oath?

258
00:21:56,670 --> 00:22:01,780
Reduce it. About 500,000 won?

259
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:07,860
- A million won? 
 - My goodness.

260
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:09,910
Don't be like this and...

261
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:12,450
just try convincing your mom again.

262
00:22:12,450 --> 00:22:14,500
That's the better way, no matter how you look at it.

263
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:17,960
Regarding mandate and the possibility of winning.

264
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,730
She said she'd rather die.

265
00:22:19,730 --> 00:22:23,210
Saying there's no need to buy herself trouble.

266
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:27,240
I mean... I can understand how your mother feels.

267
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:30,010
In the first place, she wanted to endure without divorcing...

268
00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:33,390
all for your sake, Attorney Oh. Right?

269
00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:35,370
Because you love your father so much that

270
00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:38,320
she hid it in fear of you getting shocked.

271
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:43,980
So would she want to witness her daughter dancing around with swords aimed at her father?

272
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,720
Come in.

273
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,440
Are you busy?

274
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:02,920
As you can see. Why?

275
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:15,090
You know... my mother's suit against the mistress for damages?

276
00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:19,520
Could you take that case for me, please?

277
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,220
Weren't you going to do it yourself?

278
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:23,210
I was planning to do that, but...

279
00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:25,810
it's better for my mom to do it in her name.

280
00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:29,640
Also, Mom doesn't seem to want to see my sword dance, so...

281
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:32,610
if you say you'll take the case,

282
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:35,320
she might change her mind.

283
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:38,070
I'm busy with Kim Ga Eun's trial.

284
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:40,040
You know it.

285
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:43,080
You could do it after that case ends. It's nothing urgent.

286
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:46,010
Is Senior Kang busy?  I'mâ€”

287
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:49,820
If you win... I'll even pay you a commission for winning.

288
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:54,630
- How much? 
 - 10% of the alimony.

289
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:58,320
How unfortunate.

290
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,730
I do go head over heels for money, but...

291
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:04,040
this is just too uncomfortable for me to take.

292
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:06,630
- Go look for someone else. 
 - What's uncomfortable about it?

293
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:08,800
Are you asking because you don't know?

294
00:24:13,170 --> 00:24:16,620
I mean... you're...

295
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:20,360
Gosh, a person can make mistakes after getting drunk.

296
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:23,120
- How petty... 
 - You remember everything, don't you?

297
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:25,260
Vaguely...

298
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:28,060
I don't even know how much you remember

299
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:30,080
so I can't even get mad at you.

300
00:24:31,530 --> 00:24:34,270
Since you said you remember everything,

301
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:36,770
can't I start getting mad at you now?

302
00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:40,390
You're going to get mad? At this point?

303
00:24:42,050 --> 00:24:43,570
Ha Ra...

304
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:49,660
am I easy prey to you?

305
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,990
"Am I easy prey to you?"

306
00:24:56,990 --> 00:24:59,580
"Don't think you can play the baby forever."

307
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:02,010
"If your drunk habits are that bad, quit it."

308
00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:03,810
"You need to quit drinking, not reduce it."

309
00:25:03,810 --> 00:25:06,050
He also said something else...

310
00:25:06,050 --> 00:25:08,220
Forget it. I can't remember.

311
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:11,070
I can tell he's totally furious.

312
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:15,970
It could... feel like he's been played.

313
00:25:15,970 --> 00:25:19,960
- Played? 
 - In his shoes, he could be confused.

314
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,720
"Does she still have feelings for me?"

315
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:24,030
"Is she trying to get back together with me?"

316
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:25,800
And you act as if nothing happened between you and him.

317
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:28,230
Although you said it was a drunken mistake.

318
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:32,120
Do you think I like playing cool? I'm embarrassed to death, but

319
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:34,740
I'm playing cool because I might look pathetic.

320
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:37,620
- Can't he just tell by looking? 
 - Of course, he can't.

321
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:39,850
Whether you're playing cool because you're really okay or

322
00:25:39,850 --> 00:25:41,770
because you're being shameless out of embarrassment...

323
00:25:41,770 --> 00:25:44,230
Is he a mind reader or something?

324
00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:51,710
What I'm curious about is...

325
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:54,060
What do you want to do with him?

326
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:57,550
If you had really slept with Goo Eun Beom that night,

327
00:25:57,550 --> 00:25:59,840
then what do you think would've happened?

328
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:22,890
Whoa, if he had come off as light as a feather,

329
00:26:22,890 --> 00:26:25,340
then I'd feel really screwed.

330
00:26:26,890 --> 00:26:28,860
So you do want to get back with him.

331
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:30,820
Nothing happened, though.

332
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:33,880
He doesn't even have any feelings for me, anyway.

333
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,870
Hey, what if Goo is the really annoyed one

334
00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:40,790
because you seem to be trying to be friends with benefits?

335
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:42,440
You know those conservative types.

336
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:45,860
Unni, is he Kwon Si Wook or something?

337
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:47,660
He isn't a Confucius boy or something.

338
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:51,720
Hey... why are you bringing up Kwon Si Wook here?

339
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,750
Sorry. I'm sorry.

340
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:57,080
- It's because you started saying conservativeâ€” 
 - I'm fine.

341
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:58,710
And all that.

342
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:06,180
Should I try asking him out properly?

343
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:09,180
Do it. You're still full of regrets.

344
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:11,190
No, I'll be rejected 100%.

345
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:12,810
Of course, you'll be rejected 100%.

346
00:27:12,810 --> 00:27:14,540
Why are you telling me to ask him out, then?

347
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:16,180
Is it that fun to make fun of me?

348
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:18,910
It's not fun at all.

349
00:27:18,910 --> 00:27:24,050
It's because Oh Ha Ra, the fool... still likes him!

350
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,840
 Try getting rejected about 10 times. 

351
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,720
 That should be enough for you to get over him. 

352
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,270
 What's important is... 

353
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:33,830
 that you won't be able to see anyone else unless you get over him. 

354
00:27:53,090 --> 00:27:56,830
 All right. Let's just be honest instead. 

355
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,250
I love you, Goo Eun Beom. Do you want to get back together with me?

356
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:26,090
I knew you'd be like that.

357
00:28:30,170 --> 00:28:31,750
One time.

358
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:42,430
Has she gone mad?

359
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:15,290
I'm insane.

360
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:26,900
   

361
00:29:52,530 --> 00:29:54,720
Huh? Aren't you going home?

362
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,380
No, not yet.

363
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:58,160
Why are you working so hard lately?

364
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:00,500
It's not like you.

365
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:02,230
You should give it a try.

366
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:05,900
Do you think an attempted murder case is that easy?

367
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:10,150
So why'd you take a criminal case out of nowhere and have your butt kicked around?

368
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:13,840
But hey, I heard the prosecutor is Kim Jin Won.

369
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:17,750
You must be dying not to lose to him.

370
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:19,950
Still, you do have to beat that guy.

371
00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:23,320
You better win, all right? Fighting!

372
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:29,740
Goo Eun Beom!

373
00:30:47,010 --> 00:30:50,080
When did you purchase the knife?

374
00:30:52,030 --> 00:30:53,590
I bought it on that day.

375
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:57,040
Did you purchase the knife to use as a weapon?

376
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:58,500
No.

377
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:02,750
Then, why... did you purchase the knife?

378
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:08,990
I bought it because the knife brand I like was on sale that day.

379
00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:12,660
I put it in my bag because it might be dangerous to just carry it.

380
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:16,070
So you didn't look for the knife at the thought of stabbing him, but

381
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:19,460
you found the knife in your bag and randomly

382
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:21,520
you made such a decision. Right?

383
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:23,870
Yes.

384
00:31:23,870 --> 00:31:25,560
Okay. That's all.

385
00:31:27,770 --> 00:31:31,020
Then, why didn't you take the knife out of your bag?

386
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:33,320
Wasn't it to stab Kim Eui Cheol?

387
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:37,590
I knew it was in the bag, but I didn't bring it to stab him.

388
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:40,390
- You kept it in there on purpose? 
 - No.

389
00:31:40,390 --> 00:31:45,000
Isn't it also that you purchased the knife that day as a part of your plan?

390
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,010
No.

391
00:31:46,010 --> 00:31:48,380
According to your testimony,

392
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:51,390
you brought your bag, knowing there's a knife in it.

393
00:31:51,390 --> 00:31:54,630
Are you still saying your crime wasn't intentional?

394
00:31:54,630 --> 00:31:56,730
It wasn't.

395
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:03,730
Okay, that's all.

396
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:07,570
Oh, I apologize.

397
00:32:08,450 --> 00:32:11,050
Please let me ask just one more thing.

398
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:17,190
If you... didn't have a knife...

399
00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:20,950
would you have used something else? For example...

400
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:24,290
ramming him with a car.

401
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:27,770
I didn't have such thoughts.

402
00:32:27,770 --> 00:32:31,040
In that case... if you didn't intend to harm the victim,

403
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:34,070
would you even have called him out?

404
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:35,260
No.

405
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:37,140
According to what you said,

406
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:39,160
if you didn't intend to harm him,

407
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:42,340
why did you call out the victim?

408
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,000
Your Honor!

409
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:54,740
He's asking three questions when he said he'll only ask one.

410
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,690
Defendant, please answer.

411
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:09,790
I wanted to... talk to him.

412
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:14,570
But why did you go and stab him without hearing a thing?

413
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:17,780
Let me ask you again, Defendant.

414
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:21,670
If you didn't have a knife, at that moment...

415
00:33:21,670 --> 00:33:25,520
would you really not have sought a different means?

416
00:33:41,930 --> 00:33:46,420
 Attorney Goo... did Mom's examination end well today? 

417
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:49,840
 Of course. 

418
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:58,710
 I really hope Mom will get sentenced to probation. 

419
00:33:58,710 --> 00:34:01,160
 Grandma is crying every day. 

420
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:05,080
   

421
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:06,940
 Are you okay? 

422
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:09,490
 Be sure to comfort your grandma. 

423
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:19,000
 Okay, I'll do my best. Don't worry. 

424
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:29,710
Goo Eun Beom.

425
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:32,880
I love you.

426
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:35,020
What are you doing?

427
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:37,930
Rejecting again today?

428
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:40,840
Hurry up if you're going to do it.

429
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,960
I don't have much time.

430
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,390
I don't want to.

431
00:34:44,390 --> 00:34:48,490
Okay. Five times.

432
00:34:53,790 --> 00:34:56,230
   

433
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:58,720
   

434
00:35:00,830 --> 00:35:01,900
   

435
00:35:05,010 --> 00:35:08,810
 I love you. Let's get back together when I'm asking nicely. 

436
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:12,250
   

437
00:35:13,950 --> 00:35:15,460
   

438
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:22,980
 Your answer? 

439
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:41,640
 Hey, is it fun to make a fool out of me? 

440
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:45,770
Six times.

441
00:36:03,170 --> 00:36:07,260
- Hey! It's the last one left, isn't it? 
 - Yes.

442
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:08,890
I was going to eat that.

443
00:36:08,890 --> 00:36:11,080
You were ahead of me.

444
00:36:11,930 --> 00:36:13,580
You can have it, then.

445
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:15,510
No, I was kidding. You can have it, Ye Seul.

446
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:17,930
It's fine, you can have it. I can eat something else.

447
00:36:17,930 --> 00:36:20,460
Gosh, I'm on a diet, so I can't eat it anyway.

448
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:21,730
Come on, you can really have it. I'm fine.

449
00:36:21,730 --> 00:36:23,040
You eat it, it's really fine.

450
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:25,180
Gosh, it's really okay!

451
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:30,010
Who dares... to be all lovey-dovey in a sacred workplace?

452
00:36:30,010 --> 00:36:32,430
- What lovey-dovey are you talking about? 
 - Gosh...

453
00:36:32,430 --> 00:36:36,540
Should we just fight fiercely like you and Attorney Kang?

454
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:37,890
We have a friendly relationship.

455
00:36:37,890 --> 00:36:40,920
What are you saying? Who's fighting whom fiercely?

456
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:42,530
A heated debate!

457
00:36:42,530 --> 00:36:43,850
Why does he care?

458
00:36:43,850 --> 00:36:46,420
It's Attorney Kang. Say hi.

459
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:48,610
- Hello. 
 - Good morning.

460
00:36:48,610 --> 00:36:50,520
Good morning...

461
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:53,190
Everyone.

462
00:36:54,270 --> 00:36:56,240
Good morning.

463
00:36:56,910 --> 00:36:58,890
- Why? 
 - Nothing.

464
00:36:58,890 --> 00:37:01,730
- It's so fierce. 
 - Come on, that's enough.

465
00:37:01,730 --> 00:37:03,320
What now? She said hi back.

466
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:05,610
Get to work.

467
00:37:05,610 --> 00:37:08,620
All you do is eat!

468
00:37:42,910 --> 00:37:44,740
Is it broken?

469
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:47,980
Attorney Goo didn't come to work today?

470
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:51,710
No, he seemed to have stayed overnight.

471
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:57,550
Earlier, Attorney Goo said you can't come in, Attorney Oh.

472
00:37:57,550 --> 00:37:58,550
Only me?

473
00:37:58,550 --> 00:38:00,510
Yes.

474
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:11,920
"I'm sure everyone here knows the saying

475
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:14,230
that the dead are silent."

476
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:33,690
 Hey! 

477
00:38:35,330 --> 00:38:38,510
 Hey! Are you crazy? 

478
00:38:38,510 --> 00:38:40,210
 I'm not crazy! 

479
00:38:40,210 --> 00:38:42,570
 And I loveâ€” 

480
00:38:53,930 --> 00:38:54,840
He woke up.

481
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:57,070
Thank you, Ms. Jeon.

482
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:01,660
Good morning.

483
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:07,300
Goo Eun Beom... I love you.

484
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:13,430
Whatâ€” Are we going out?

485
00:39:13,430 --> 00:39:15,990
Follow me. Let's talk outside.

486
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,630
What's the matter with you lately? Why do you keep bothering me?

487
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:27,380
I told you.

488
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:30,690
Let me get rejected just 10 times, and I'll get over you with no regrets.

489
00:39:30,690 --> 00:39:33,930
I need to get over you first in order to meet someoneâ€”

490
00:39:33,930 --> 00:39:36,770
Can't you just... say you were rejected 10 times?

491
00:39:36,770 --> 00:39:38,620
You really lack sincerity.

492
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:40,640
Is it that hard to reply to me?

493
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:43,920
Are you the one to talk about having sincerity? Sending just a text.

494
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:48,940
Do I need to kneel with a bouquet of flowers every time I confess?

495
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:51,790
Hey, that's not what I'm saying. Gosh...

496
00:39:52,650 --> 00:39:54,320
Forget it. Okay.

497
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:56,920
Let's just see the end of this today.

498
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,290
Go ahead. Say what you want.

499
00:39:58,290 --> 00:40:00,350
- I love you. 
 - No, you don't love me.

500
00:40:00,350 --> 00:40:03,460
- I'm saying I love youâ€” 
 - Listen up.

501
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:06,970
What you're doing to me right now is an obsession.

502
00:40:06,970 --> 00:40:09,760
It's regret and obstinance.

503
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:12,510
You don't love me. You can't love me.

504
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:16,020
Think about what I did to you! What did I say when I...

505
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:18,670
wanted to break up with you?

506
00:40:21,930 --> 00:40:25,240
 Let's get a divorce. 

507
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:27,280
 Wh-What? 

508
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:31,320
 What are you saying? 

509
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:39,440
 I'm seeing someone else. 

510
00:40:40,810 --> 00:40:42,560
 I'm sorry. 

511
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:48,030
Anyhow, you didn't have an affair.

512
00:40:48,030 --> 00:40:50,310
So it's okay.

513
00:40:50,310 --> 00:40:55,220
I ran away from you because I wanted to break up with you...

514
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:57,820
so badly that I'd even spit such a lie.

515
00:40:57,820 --> 00:40:59,250
Don't you loath me?

516
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:03,020
I do. Of course, I do!

517
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:06,890
But I still love you.

518
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:11,960
You're...

519
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:14,950
out of order.

520
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:18,380
How can you love me when you loathe me?

521
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:21,310
Don't you think it's weird? Give it some more thought.

522
00:41:21,310 --> 00:41:22,680
I gave it plenty of deep thought.

523
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:24,760
- However? 
 - However, what?

524
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:26,140
I loathe you.

525
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:27,850
I loathe you, but...

526
00:41:27,850 --> 00:41:30,050
I like you.

527
00:41:30,050 --> 00:41:31,850
What do you want me to do?

528
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:34,740
I hate you, but I want you.

529
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:38,370
I want to kill you for one second and want to kiss you right after.

530
00:41:39,790 --> 00:41:41,840
Facing the person you are...

531
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:45,420
always strikes fear into my heart, butâ€”

532
00:41:51,770 --> 00:41:54,250
but I still can't take my eyes off of you.

533
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:03,410
The fact that I loathe you so much...

534
00:42:03,410 --> 00:42:05,760
would be proof I love you, wouldn't it?

535
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:10,470
- So pleaseâ€” 
 - Ha Ra...

536
00:42:10,470 --> 00:42:12,610
I love you.

537
00:42:14,690 --> 00:42:16,460
I'm right.

538
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:31,000
   

539
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:41,650
 In my opinion, you two are not over each other yet. 

540
00:42:41,650 --> 00:42:44,940
 Well, to put it in other words... 

541
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:46,900
 hate is also love. 

542
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:49,010
 Hotter than love, actually. 

543
00:42:49,010 --> 00:42:53,570
 The fact that I loathe you so much... 

544
00:42:53,570 --> 00:42:56,460
 would be proof I love you, wouldn't it? 

545
00:42:56,460 --> 00:42:58,540
 - So pleaseâ€” 
 - Ha Ra... 

546
00:42:58,540 --> 00:43:00,390
 I love you. 

547
00:43:02,670 --> 00:43:04,580
 I'm right. 

548
00:43:10,950 --> 00:43:12,710
   

549
00:43:21,020 --> 00:43:24,740
 Hate. 

550
00:43:28,630 --> 00:43:31,950
 Love. 

551
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:42,040
   

552
00:43:54,710 --> 00:43:56,570
 Sometimes, we need to focus... 

553
00:43:56,570 --> 00:44:00,160
 more on action than words. 

554
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:02,070
The police told her

555
00:44:02,070 --> 00:44:07,250
she's under arrest on allegations of attempted murder of Kim Eui Cheol.

556
00:44:07,250 --> 00:44:09,310
However, the defendant...

557
00:44:09,310 --> 00:44:14,010
didn't say a word of denial or rebuttal.

558
00:44:14,010 --> 00:44:15,660
Yes, that's right.

559
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:19,870
This action is the most honest action, which tells us

560
00:44:19,870 --> 00:44:22,420
the truth about the matter on hand.

561
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:27,910
In fact, we don't need anything else.

562
00:44:27,910 --> 00:44:30,840
Testimony only aimed to defend herself, and

563
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:34,650
the attorney's feverish defense.

564
00:44:34,650 --> 00:44:37,570
Instead of those countless words...

565
00:44:37,570 --> 00:44:40,420
we can explain everything by

566
00:44:40,420 --> 00:44:43,830
looking at her actions of preparing a weapon, stabbing a person,

567
00:44:43,830 --> 00:44:46,890
and implicitly admitting to her crime.

568
00:44:46,890 --> 00:44:49,440
The defendant's murder...

569
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:52,580
had more than enough intentionality.

570
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:01,160
Your Honor... this case is...

571
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:05,430
a typically planned murder caused by an affair and grudge.

572
00:45:05,430 --> 00:45:06,880
However...

573
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:10,980
it didn't only take a person's life.

574
00:45:12,350 --> 00:45:14,280
Taking someone else's husband,

575
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:16,240
taking someone else's father,

576
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:20,900
she drove a peaceful family to complete destruction.

577
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:24,520
Taking into account the defendant's circumstances

578
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:28,130
and how she ended up committing the crime,

579
00:45:28,130 --> 00:45:29,780
the prosecution seeks...

580
00:45:30,810 --> 00:45:34,110
a prison term of 15 years.

581
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:56,010
I'm sure everyone here knows...

582
00:45:56,010 --> 00:45:59,990
the saying, "Dead men tell no tales."

583
00:45:59,990 --> 00:46:02,900
For that reason, murder is...

584
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:06,380
   

585
00:46:09,010 --> 00:46:11,190
   

586
00:46:11,190 --> 00:46:13,170
   

587
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:21,390
Attorney Goo?

588
00:46:24,820 --> 00:46:27,810
I apologize. I'll redo it.

589
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:32,830
Prosecutor, thank you for your closing statement.

590
00:46:32,830 --> 00:46:34,540
I think it was a remarkable closing statement.

591
00:46:34,540 --> 00:46:39,200
However, I wanted to ask one thing about how you talked about truth earlier.

592
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:41,790
You said only her actions told us the

593
00:46:41,790 --> 00:46:45,760
truth of this case, honestly.

594
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:49,980
But at the moment of hearing that, I had this thought.

595
00:46:49,980 --> 00:46:51,830
Truth.

596
00:46:53,290 --> 00:46:55,250
What is truth?

597
00:46:57,820 --> 00:46:59,410
Of course, I know.

598
00:46:59,410 --> 00:47:04,280
Our legal system actually doesn't pursue absolute truth. Instead,

599
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:07,050
we're pursuing substantive truth.

600
00:47:07,050 --> 00:47:11,340
I'm sure the prosecutor also was talking in that sense. Right?

601
00:47:11,340 --> 00:47:13,630
However, Your Honor,

602
00:47:13,630 --> 00:47:16,140
I had this on second thought.

603
00:47:16,140 --> 00:47:20,460
"Is it impossible to have two substantive truths regarding one matter?"

604
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:24,040
This matter is just the same.

605
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:25,690
If she wanted to kill him,

606
00:47:25,690 --> 00:47:26,890
if that really is the case,

607
00:47:26,890 --> 00:47:29,030
could there have been only her feelings about it?

608
00:47:29,030 --> 00:47:31,590
No, even at that moment,

609
00:47:31,590 --> 00:47:33,090
I'm sure there were double-edged...

610
00:47:33,090 --> 00:47:36,830
paradoxical feelings opposing each other.

611
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:41,700
Although... she hated the man who abandoned her to death, but she still loved him.

612
00:47:41,710 --> 00:47:46,010
She probably wanted to kill him but couldn't bring herself to do it.

613
00:47:46,010 --> 00:47:50,320
Therefore, the substantive truth of this case is ultimately

614
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:52,180
that she felt betrayed enough to want to kill him,

615
00:47:52,180 --> 00:47:54,220
so she stabbed him with the knife she had.

616
00:47:54,220 --> 00:47:58,340
But she couldn't even stab him deeply enough to kill him.

617
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:03,720
That's all.

618
00:48:05,900 --> 00:48:07,670
She loved him...

619
00:48:09,430 --> 00:48:11,720
and hated him at the same time.

620
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:13,810
Anyone, if he's human...

621
00:48:17,030 --> 00:48:18,830
can do that...

622
00:48:20,470 --> 00:48:22,490
regardless of who he is.

623
00:48:41,650 --> 00:48:44,090
   

624
00:48:53,170 --> 00:48:54,780
Dad said he'll just...

625
00:48:54,780 --> 00:48:59,390
live with his mistress and her daughter, Ro Ra, or whatever her name is.

626
00:49:01,670 --> 00:49:02,950
Makes you mad, right?

627
00:49:02,950 --> 00:49:04,490
So let's get on with the lawsuit.

628
00:49:04,490 --> 00:49:06,860
- I said I'll find you a different lawyerâ€” 
 - Gosh, I won't.

629
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:07,980
I told you I don't want to.

630
00:49:07,980 --> 00:49:09,820
So why don't you want to?

631
00:49:09,820 --> 00:49:11,680
Wasn't it because of me?

632
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:15,070
I'm saying I'll get you a lawyer instead of doing it myself.

633
00:49:15,070 --> 00:49:16,910
Hey, cut it out.

634
00:49:16,910 --> 00:49:18,740
Auntie, doesn't this seem so unfair?

635
00:49:18,740 --> 00:49:19,910
There's no need to feel unfair.

636
00:49:19,910 --> 00:49:22,580
- Your mom also has a boyfriendâ€” 
 - Oh, my, Sis!

637
00:49:25,490 --> 00:49:28,190
What? Why?

638
00:49:28,190 --> 00:49:31,080
She's 35 years old.

639
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:34,050
She'll understand, of course.

640
00:49:37,790 --> 00:49:41,850
He's just a friend from when I was in college.

641
00:49:41,850 --> 00:49:44,530
He's helping me apply to grad school.

642
00:49:44,530 --> 00:49:46,060
A male...

643
00:49:47,230 --> 00:49:48,880
friend.

644
00:49:53,630 --> 00:49:56,660
Isn't this too fast?

645
00:49:57,570 --> 00:49:59,830
Goodness, you doofus!

646
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:03,510
Should she be mourning for three years like you, then?

647
00:50:11,470 --> 00:50:12,890
Have some.

648
00:50:20,260 --> 00:50:22,410
Everything's done now.

649
00:50:22,410 --> 00:50:24,900
You just need to report to the district office.

650
00:50:28,130 --> 00:50:29,730
Okay.

651
00:50:32,150 --> 00:50:33,760
I'm sorry.

652
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:38,070
I really... am too ashamed to face you.

653
00:50:39,140 --> 00:50:43,200
You'll still see me sometimes, won't you?

654
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:45,280
Why the hell would I?

655
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:47,790
We're just going our separate ways now.

656
00:50:47,790 --> 00:50:50,990
You have your baby daughter besides me.

657
00:50:50,990 --> 00:50:52,590
Find joy in seeing her now.

658
00:50:52,590 --> 00:50:54,140
She looks so much like you that

659
00:50:54,140 --> 00:50:56,610
it wouldn't hurt to put her in your eyes.

660
00:51:00,550 --> 00:51:02,230
It's not that...

661
00:51:02,230 --> 00:51:04,090
it wouldn't hurt to put her in my eyes.

662
00:51:04,090 --> 00:51:05,710
She's really sick.

663
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:10,240
She was born with a heart defect.

664
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:15,010
You know how I also have a weak heart.

665
00:51:17,790 --> 00:51:19,990
She just had to...

666
00:51:22,690 --> 00:51:24,940
inherit that from me.

667
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:37,100
Ha Ra... listen to me carefully.

668
00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:39,840
You're my first love.

669
00:51:40,780 --> 00:51:43,400
The affection you have for your first child

670
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:46,720
is indescribable in words.

671
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:49,570
You're the one...

672
00:51:49,570 --> 00:51:52,320
whom I'll love the most in the world...

673
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:55,580
until I die.

674
00:52:01,310 --> 00:52:03,700
Just let me see you here and there.

675
00:52:03,700 --> 00:52:05,900
Only sometimes.

676
00:52:05,900 --> 00:52:08,630
I won't contact you too often.

677
00:52:13,090 --> 00:52:15,540
If you contact me too often...

678
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:20,990
I'll really block you off.

679
00:52:35,460 --> 00:52:38,090
Who's the one who destroyed a fine family?

680
00:52:38,090 --> 00:52:40,750
Watching my mom live a new life and

681
00:52:40,750 --> 00:52:44,920
that man caretaking his young daughter like that...

682
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:47,250
Gosh, why is it so pitiful?

683
00:52:47,250 --> 00:52:50,170
All of that adds up to love-hate, doesn't it?

684
00:52:50,170 --> 00:52:51,760
Exactly.

685
00:52:52,810 --> 00:52:56,610
Life is just so complicated on many levels.

686
00:52:56,610 --> 00:53:00,310
Hey, your mother is so cool, by the way.

687
00:53:00,310 --> 00:53:04,100
As your aunt said, she's way better than her daughter.

688
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:05,480
Setting revenge and all aside,

689
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:08,810
it's so cool how she started studying again.

690
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:14,100
Finding your life and moving with it is true revenge.

691
00:53:14,100 --> 00:53:17,120
I also think that way in my head, butâ€”

692
00:53:19,330 --> 00:53:21,810
Thank you.

693
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:26,740
- Please enjoy. 
 - Okay.

694
00:53:28,010 --> 00:53:32,720
But I feel betrayed for some odd reason...

695
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:36,960
I don't know what's wrong with me.

696
00:53:40,660 --> 00:53:43,810
Unni, eat up. Go ahead.

697
00:53:43,810 --> 00:53:45,330
Let's talk after we eat.

698
00:53:45,330 --> 00:53:47,070
That's not what I mean...

699
00:53:48,090 --> 00:53:50,950
The sea pineapple smells funny.

700
00:53:50,950 --> 00:53:52,550
Let me see.

701
00:53:57,070 --> 00:53:58,750
Does it smell weird?

702
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:10,770
Is the smell that bad?

703
00:54:12,450 --> 00:54:14,390
It smells fine.

704
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:42,270
In the end, she brought it all upon herself.

705
00:54:42,270 --> 00:54:45,910
Because she fell in love with a married man and gave birth,

706
00:54:45,910 --> 00:54:48,900
the injustice she feels can't be fathomed.

707
00:54:48,900 --> 00:54:51,060
If her feelings are fathomed,

708
00:54:51,060 --> 00:54:54,620
the bereaved widow and her children

709
00:54:54,620 --> 00:54:57,520
will be scarred for life.

710
00:54:57,520 --> 00:55:01,250
Nonetheless... connecting her circumstances before and after the crime,

711
00:55:01,250 --> 00:55:03,300
it can be taken into account that it wasn't premeditated and

712
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:08,320
how the crime was committed at the spur of the moment.

713
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:12,120
Also, there isn't enough evidence to say that the defendant

714
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:16,930
was considering, even for a moment,

715
00:55:16,930 --> 00:55:19,160
trying to kill the victim.

716
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:24,070
Besides that, the defendant confessed to her crimes entirely,

717
00:55:24,070 --> 00:55:26,270
cooperating with the investigation,

718
00:55:26,270 --> 00:55:28,460
submitted letters of apology every day,

719
00:55:28,460 --> 00:55:33,030
showing diligently how she regretted her crime,

720
00:55:33,030 --> 00:55:38,100
and, lastly, her dependent child is still a minor.

721
00:55:38,100 --> 00:55:42,400
Considering her family circumstances, including the said facts,

722
00:55:44,900 --> 00:55:47,730
and admitting the defendant's allegations of assault with a deadly weapon,

723
00:55:47,730 --> 00:55:51,420
she is to be sentenced to seven years in prison.

724
00:56:31,910 --> 00:56:33,630
Attorney Goo.

725
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:38,010
- Thank you. 
 - For what?

726
00:56:38,010 --> 00:56:40,710
I'm sorry for failing to get probation.

727
00:56:40,710 --> 00:56:42,450
No, no.

728
00:56:42,450 --> 00:56:44,790
I accepted the judge's ruling.

729
00:56:44,790 --> 00:56:48,500
You prevented my mom from being charged with murder.

730
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:50,550
Thank you.

731
00:57:16,330 --> 00:57:17,940
Hey.

732
00:57:20,750 --> 00:57:22,770
Let me ask you something.

733
00:57:22,770 --> 00:57:25,490
Your closing argument was all a show, huh?

734
00:57:25,490 --> 00:57:28,570
That's the script you prepared in the first place, right?

735
00:57:28,570 --> 00:57:30,000
Of course.

736
00:57:30,970 --> 00:57:34,450
- When we meet next timeâ€” 
 - Pray that we won't.

737
00:57:34,450 --> 00:57:36,060
If you don't want to lose again.

738
00:57:36,060 --> 00:57:38,250
How did Ha Ra end up dating trash like you

739
00:57:38,250 --> 00:57:40,360
and ruining her perfectly fine life?

740
00:57:40,360 --> 00:57:42,350
Damn it.

741
00:57:54,210 --> 00:57:55,490
Hey,

742
00:57:56,610 --> 00:58:00,270
I admit I'm trash, but Ha Ra's life isn't ruined.

743
00:58:00,270 --> 00:58:02,830
You shouldn't run your mouth just because you have one.

744
00:58:02,830 --> 00:58:08,430
This is why girls regard you... as a junk car.

745
00:58:35,930 --> 00:58:37,950
 The verdict comes out today, right? 

746
00:58:37,950 --> 00:58:40,620
 How did it go? 

747
00:58:40,620 --> 00:58:44,440
   
 Oh, and... I love you. 

748
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:47,570
 It's the last time, so I'm nervous. That's why I'm texting. 

749
00:58:58,990 --> 00:59:01,210
It's the last time, so she's nervous?

750
00:59:18,660 --> 00:59:21,160
   

751
00:59:34,530 --> 00:59:35,680
Hello?

752
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:37,560
Not guilty of murder.

753
00:59:37,560 --> 00:59:39,830
Sentenced to seven years in prison for assault with a deadly weapon.

754
00:59:40,830 --> 00:59:42,260
What the?

755
00:59:42,260 --> 00:59:44,670
You called me to tell me that?

756
00:59:45,660 --> 00:59:47,950
While I'm at it.

757
00:59:51,190 --> 00:59:54,580
All right. Good work.

758
00:59:54,580 --> 00:59:56,290
Now...

759
01:00:03,020 --> 01:00:04,300
next...

760
01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:06,290
 This is the tenth time. 

761
01:00:06,290 --> 01:00:08,270
If I reject you,

762
01:00:08,270 --> 01:00:10,740
you're sure you'll get over me. Right?

763
01:00:12,620 --> 01:00:16,310
Yes, I won't make excuses. Hurry up and answer me.

764
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:20,260
Let's see each other.

765
01:00:21,340 --> 01:00:22,490
Right now?

766
01:00:22,490 --> 01:00:23,990
No.

767
01:00:27,860 --> 01:00:29,450
Again.

768
01:00:55,090 --> 01:01:02,990


769
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:11,440
 Why did you decide to see me again? 

770
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:13,880
 I just want to follow my heart. 

771
01:01:13,880 --> 01:01:16,210
 What if I get pregnant? 

772
01:01:16,210 --> 01:01:17,650
 Who's the baby's father? 

773
01:01:17,650 --> 01:01:20,030
 Saying, what is the problem? We decided to live as DINK. 

774
01:01:20,030 --> 01:01:22,400
 How can she do that without discussing it with him when they made the baby together? 

775
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:23,450
 What? 

776
01:01:23,450 --> 01:01:25,110
 What I'm saying isâ€” 

777
01:01:25,110 --> 01:01:27,550
 - I can't even worry about you? 
 - Why would you worry about me? 

778
01:01:27,550 --> 01:01:29,620
 Why on earth don't you want to have a baby? 

779
01:01:29,620 --> 01:01:32,300
 Why do you want to have a baby? 

780
01:01:32,300 --> 01:01:35,500
 There's a fight waiting to happen. 

781
01:01:35,500 --> 01:01:39,200
