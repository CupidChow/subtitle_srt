1
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:12,600
What is it?

2
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:13,800
Are you with Dokgo?

3
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:15,930
What audacity for a little punk...

4
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:28,960
 

5
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:36,900
 

6
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:44,300
♫  You were there in those times  ♫

7
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:47,700
♫  We'll go through it together   ♫

8
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:52,400
♫  I can have a new dream of my life   ♫

9
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:56,100
♫  For the first time, first time, yeah  ♫

10
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:59,800
♫  I can't do this alone, come on  ♫

11
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:07,700
♫  Sometimes I get nervous about 
the future that is yet to come   ♫

12
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:11,400
 

13
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,400
You're here.

14
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:15,670
 

15
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:20,110
 

16
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:23,740
What are you doing?

17
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,700
What else? Same old, same old.

18
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,940
I'm hungry.

19
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:33,650
You got a parasite? 
You just went to the store.

20
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:35,990
Hey, that's in the past.

21
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,400
- Do you have money?
- No, I don't.

22
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:40,030
Especially money to buy you food.

23
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:41,440
How about you, Hyuk?

24
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,640
You think I do?

25
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,020
Right.

26
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,800
The kids in school must be having 
warm meals right about now.

27
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:53,000
Slurping and chomping, huh?

28
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,200
Do you have to talk 
about eating again?

29
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,460
Why don't you just go 
back to school?

30
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:00,040
Is it possible?

31
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,130
I don't know either!

32
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:03,130
Who knows?

33
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:06,250
Maybe they may let you
 back in if you beg.

34
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:10,430
Why? Does that sound cool?

35
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:14,290
Yeah.

36
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:15,400
Beg...

37
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:18,160
What?

38
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,560
I'm not doing anything.

39
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,210
You want to know?

40
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:24,320
The three of us are here.

41
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,840
100,000 won?

42
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:26,850
100,000 won.

43
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:28,190
Okay, deal!

44
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:29,330
Alright.

45
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:30,920
See you there in an hour.

46
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:35,140
- Who is it?
- Let's go and make some money.

47
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:44,360
 

48
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:47,280
You all know that we'll be 
facing Dongjin, right?

49
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,500
  Yes! 

50
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:51,780
We have Gang Hoon on our side, 
but we're short on numbers

51
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:53,860
so make sure to show up after school.

52
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:57,110
 
Call all the suspended bastards
 and tell them to show up, too.

53
00:04:57,110 --> 00:05:00,190
 

54
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:02,920
- Got it?
 - Yes.  

55
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,130
- Dang Young!
  - The strongest! 

56
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:06,520
- Dang Young!
  - The strongest! 

57
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:12,430
 

58
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:14,260
- Dang Young!
  - The strongest! 

59
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:18,680
- Dang Young!
  - The strongest! 

60
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,130
- Dang Young!
  - The strongest! 

61
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:25,860
Hey, who is she looking for? 
She's always here when we train.

62
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,830
Is it you, Tae Jin?

63
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:32,100
- Dang Young!
  - The strongest! 

64
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:37,920
- Dang Young!
  - The strongest! 

65
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:45,740
- 10th grade, class 3.
- Yes.

66
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:48,060
How many members do you have?

67
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:50,160
A total of 25.

68
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,600
Then why is there only 200,000 won?

69
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,160
How about the other four?

70
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,980
They said they really 
don't have any money.

71
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,290
I'm sorry.

72
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:02,450
- They don't have money, huh?
- I'm sorry.

73
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:04,300
- They don't have money, huh?
- I'm sorry.

74
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:06,440
Because they don't 
have money, huh?

75
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,930
So you took pity on them, huh?

76
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:10,330
No, I didn't.

77
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:15,420
Lee Gi Su and Jun Bu Suh, 
come forward.

78
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:23,640
I said pay up out of 
your own pockets first

79
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,970
and get the money later, right?

80
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:27,830
Yes, you said so.

81
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:31,670
Why don't you answer me?

82
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,570
School's going so smoothly, huh?

83
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,500
What?

84
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,930
You feel crappy, huh?

85
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:44,500
No, I don't.

86
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:50,160
You 10th grader leaders 
have to do well

87
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,910
so others can follow properly.

88
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:57,100
You guys really have it easy.

89
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:00,900
When I was a 10th grader, I couldn't 
even look at my sunbaes' eyes.

90
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:04,130
Move...

91
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:09,030
What the heck? 
You're in the way. Get lost!

92
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:12,300
- Oppa!
 - Hi, Soo Jung.

93
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:14,080
What's going on with what I said?

94
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,660
That's...

95
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:17,610
What's going on?

96
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:20,850
She's in the hospital right now, 
so when she's released...

97
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:23,040
I told you to beat up the guy at least.

98
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,930
Don't you understand?

99
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:26,930
Okay. Tomorrow, I'll...

100
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:28,390
What do you mean tomorrow?

101
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:32,100
Do it today not tomorrow! Right now!

102
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:34,280
I'll do it right away.

103
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,740
Seriously. S***.

104
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,800
Move!

105
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:48,580
Hey, guys.

106
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:49,990
Yes.

107
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:52,640
Bring Kim Kyu Soon right now!

108
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:08,940
 

109
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:23,000
C'mon. Let me just go.

110
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:30,010
Can't you just let me go?

111
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,400
Resisting?

112
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,500
Resisting?

113
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:36,800
Bastard!

114
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,900
- Hyun Sun is in the... 
 - What?

115
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:42,400
- You want to die, huh? 
 - Yes, we got him.

116
00:08:42,410 --> 00:08:44,690
We'll come to school right away.

117
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:47,350
Hey.

118
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:48,920
What are you doing?

119
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:52,090
He'll get beat up anyway...

120
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:54,850
Why don't we have some fun, too?

121
00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:57,800
He says to bring him right away, a**hole.

122
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:02,350
Since when did you start doing 
everything Joo Sung says?

123
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:04,060
I wish we could do this every day.

124
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:06,180
Pork belly just melts in your mouth.

125
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:07,410
What did you do exactly?

126
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:10,040
We only won because I caught up 
with you after your mess.

127
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:13,640
Hey, I was making dramatic moves...

128
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:16,350
What is this?

129
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:17,620
Taking money from him, huh?

130
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:19,500
Hey, just get lost.

131
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,820
Don't butt in.

132
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,180
Get lost!

133
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:24,910
Is this your turf?

134
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:27,160
Who are you to tell me to get lost?

135
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:31,190
That's right, you bastard!

136
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,300
This is my aunt's land 
and our hang out.

137
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:36,510
These punks just don't get it.

138
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:38,200
We're from Dang Young High.

139
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,770
Dang Young High.

140
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:42,190
Don't you know about Gichun and 
Dang Young's alliance?

141
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,130
I don't know.

142
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:47,670
Wait a minute.

143
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:49,970
Thank you for trying to help me but

144
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,500
I'm okay so pretend you 
didn't see anything, okay?

145
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,300
What?

146
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,690
Thank you.

147
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:59,700
I really thank you, but I'm really okay.

148
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:03,050
Wow, Kyu Soon knows how 
to survive in the real world.

149
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:04,220
Huh?

150
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:06,920
Just let them go.

151
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,320
Really?

152
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,220
Their uniforms are the same.

153
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:13,090
If we rescue him, he'll get it 
worse tomorrow at school.

154
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,100
Okay.

155
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,660
Leave.

156
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,800
I don't like the way you talk.

157
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:24,200
As if you could rescue him 
if you really wanted to.

158
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,400
Huh?

159
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:29,860
If I want...

160
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:32,390
I could kill you.

161
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,310
He can even make me laugh.

162
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:42,300
Don't kill a chicken with a 
knife used to kill a horse.

163
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:44,420
Man, you’re driving me crazy.

164
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:46,170
And it's a cow, you idiot.

165
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,700
Either one works...

166
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:52,920
♫  Here comes the most 
of f****** night  ♫

167
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:57,630
♫  I won't abandon you, who is 
shining for the last time  ♫

168
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:02,660
♫  Here comes the most 
of f****** night  ♫

169
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:05,270
♫  all of your world that is dark  ♫

170
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:07,180
Hey, parasite. Need help?

171
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:12,150
If you want to help, just buy me 
some fried chicken later.

172
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:15,480
Hey, get up.

173
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:18,900
There you go!

174
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,800
Hey! That's so cowardly...

175
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:24,000
What do you mean cowardly?

176
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:25,840
As long as I win.

177
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,260
- Right?
 - No!

178
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:31,640
S***!

179
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,000
Why?

180
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,240
What?

181
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,070
As long as I win, right?

182
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:38,780
That's right.

183
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:40,440
As long as I win...

184
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,010
You know something?

185
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,560
I think I'm a bit more 
cowardly than you.

186
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:54,710
Should we continue?

187
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,270
Get lost!

188
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:07,690
Are you okay?

189
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:11,650
We killed them.

190
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,800
- You leave, too.
 - Yeah.

191
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:18,700
Um...

192
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:23,160
- Can you help me?
- What?

193
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,910
I don't think I can go to 
school for some time.

194
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:27,980
If I go, they'll step all over me.

195
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:29,740
Are you dumb?

196
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:34,260
You think we're any better 
than those guys?

197
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:36,810
- No, it's not that.
- Go.

198
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,000
- Hey, Hyuk. 
 - My sister!

199
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:44,300
I want to protect my sister. 
That's why.

200
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,600
So...

201
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,710
did you guys eat?

202
00:12:56,750 --> 00:13:00,510
You ate pork belly 30 minutes ago. 
How can you eat more?

203
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:04,100
I digested everything during the fight.

204
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:07,270
I'd rather raise a cow than this bastard.

205
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:11,600
Oh, my...

206
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:14,230
Drink my water.

207
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:24,630
You're a good bastard.

208
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:29,250
Wait a minute. Let me see.

209
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:31,850
What, what, what? What is it?

210
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:34,000
Whoa! Hey, look.

211
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,100
She's pretty. Look.

212
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:39,670
Is this your sister?

213
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:42,110
Yeah. Right. Why?

214
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:47,740
You're sharing your food?

215
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:50,820
Brother-in-law!

216
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:53,370
You want to protect your sister?

217
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:55,050
Don't worry, brother-in-law.

218
00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:58,420
Why? Because I can 
protect her, okay?

219
00:13:58,420 --> 00:13:59,780
Brother-in-law.

220
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:06,030
Tell us the rest of the story 
while we're at it.

221
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:07,860
What happened to your sister?

222
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,190
So...

223
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:14,960
my sister Hyun Sun started 
attending our school.

224
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:19,860
But Shin Soo Jung...

225
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:23,380
was in my sister's class.

226
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:27,190
Shin Soo Jung is the girlfriend 
of the 11th grader leader, Joo Sung.

227
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:46,190
 

228
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:56,330
 I get the picture.  

229
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:59,410
Joo Sung was interested
 in your sister

230
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:02,060
and Shin Soo Jung got crazy jealous.

231
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:03,860
So she scared her, right?

232
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,900
Not just scaring her, but...

233
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:12,450
Hey,

234
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:14,490
Did you flirt with Joo Sung?

235
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:16,540
How dare you get greedy?

236
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:17,860
Hey.

237
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:19,200
Move over.

238
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:22,330
Hey.

239
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:24,560
Are you that pretty, b****?

240
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:31,290
You think you're pretty, too, right?

241
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:36,440
If I ever see your face again...

242
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,080
you're dead.

243
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:40,500
Got it? Dang it!

244
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:43,550
Stay still.

245
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:44,920
Make her drink it.

246
00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:49,280
Open...

247
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,400
Drink it.

248
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,000
Hyun Sun.

249
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:59,910
Tell your mom and pop...

250
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:02,450
that you mistook it as a beverage.

251
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:03,850
Got it?

252
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:06,830
Make her drink it.

253
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:13,210
Bunch of SOBs!

254
00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:15,820
But why is Joo Sung bugging you?

255
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:18,670
Shin Soo Jung's cousin 
Shin Do Yoon

256
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:20,720
also attends our school.

257
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,550
He's a senior.

258
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:24,080
He's one of the leaders in the group.

259
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:32,630
Hey,

260
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:35,300
you cheated on Soo Jung, huh?

261
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:36,620
No, it's...

262
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:38,700
- You're crazy, right?
- No.

263
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:41,320
Her brother also attends 
our school, huh?

264
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,480
Yes.

265
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,030
Squash him.

266
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:46,610
- Excuse me?
- Beat him half to death.

267
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:47,940
Don't you understand?

268
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,650
- Huh?
- Yes, I got it.

269
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,600
The answer is simple.

270
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:55,410
Wipe out the punks at 
Dang Young High, right?

271
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:58,870
Aigoo, it's not as simple as you think.

272
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:01,250
Because I got punched 
a few times earlier?

273
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:04,000
That was because 
he was playing dirty!

274
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,480
If we really fight, I'd win!

275
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:09,400
Dang Young High is one thing, but 
Gi Cheon and Dang Young are allies.

276
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,900
Allies... so what? 
What does that mean?

277
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,300
Am I the only one who doesn't know?

278
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:18,530
Anyways, Gi Cheon High 
has Jo Gang Hoon.

279
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:21,160
He's the top in this area.

280
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:42,090
Let's keep it simple. 
You and I, one to one.

281
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:45,130
 

282
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:46,290
What do you think?

283
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,400
Are you sure?

284
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,400
- Hey, Yang Tae!
- Yeah.

285
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:54,050
Hey!

286
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,810
You're not all that as 
I thought. You okay?

287
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:10,210
Huh?

288
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,720
He has never lost a fight.

289
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:16,280
Where's your house?

290
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:21,100
I have to take a shuttle
 across the street.

291
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:23,920
Go straight home.

292
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:27,350
Don't roam around and get 
caught by those punks.

293
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,040
But...

294
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:34,210
the thing you said before...

295
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:37,120
The fact that you'd help me...

296
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:43,550
Come to the same spot 
tomorrow night.

297
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,220
Thank you.

298
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:48,630
Thank you so much.

299
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:50,420
I'll leave now.

300
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:53,170
Bye.

301
00:19:54,490 --> 00:19:56,640
Let's go, too.

302
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,640
At night?

303
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,320
I'll be late tomorrow.

304
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,680
I have plans with my family.

305
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:06,600
Hey, you can cancel 
with your family.

306
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,420
I want to but...

307
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:11,390
- my hyung will nag.
- You have a hyung?

308
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,410
I'm leaving. See you tomorrow.

309
00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:17,150
Bye.

310
00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:21,740
Someone actually nags Hyuk?

311
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:25,310
Hey, if it's Hyuk's hyung, he must be 
an awesome fighter, huh?

312
00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:36,620
You're home.

313
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:45,540
You were at school all day, 
and you still want to study?

314
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:47,790
It's something I like to do.

315
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:49,710
You have to prepare, too.

316
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:51,370
You were a great student in school.

317
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:53,120
You're nagging as soon
 as you see me?

318
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:57,720
Is school okay for you?

319
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,670
You know how it is.

320
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:01,220
Of course,

321
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:03,550
you are the top student in school.

322
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:05,260
It has to be great.

323
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:07,800
Hurry and come back, too. 
Or take the GED...

324
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,630
Hey. Forget it.

325
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:12,550
Is there anyone bothering you?

326
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,760
Huh?

327
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:17,080
If there is, just tell me.

328
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:20,790
I don't have anyone like that.

329
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:22,350
That's good then.

330
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:26,840
You know we are taking a family 
portrait tomorrow night, right?

331
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:30,750
- Don't go anywhere tomorrow...
- I know, I remember.

332
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:32,840
Okay, go to sleep.

333
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:54,550
Dang, this hurts a lot.

334
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:56,490
What should we do?

335
00:21:56,490 --> 00:21:58,810
What do you mean?

336
00:21:58,810 --> 00:22:03,120
Joo Sung, that psycho, will take all 
our money as soon as he sees us.

337
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,700
Why is that bastard making us
 clean up his mess?

338
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:10,390
He should clean up his own mess.

339
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:12,830
Let's stop doing this.

340
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:14,400
You crazy bastard.

341
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,100
How can we do that?

342
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:20,520
Just shut up and follow 
my lead, you bastard.

343
00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:32,910
Yesterday, you...

344
00:22:32,910 --> 00:22:35,230
said with your own mouth,

345
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:38,830
that you got him, didn't you?

346
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:41,730
Yes.

347
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:44,710
Then where is Kim Kyu Soon?

348
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:47,240
And what happened to your faces?

349
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,950
I'm sorry.

350
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:50,340
I'm sorry.

351
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:53,500
Did you get beat up by Kim Kyu Soon?

352
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:58,260
- It's not that.
- If not, then what?

353
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:00,850
We were planning to
 return right away,

354
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:03,020
but some punks suddenly appeared,

355
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:05,740
beat us up and took Kim Kyu Soon.

356
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:07,890
Some punks?

357
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:11,040
We wanted to fight them, 
but it was difficult.

358
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,960
They seemed older than us and

359
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,560
those thugs weren't 
even attending schools.

360
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,850
Why would those thugs 
help Kim Kyu Soon?

361
00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:20,230
I'm not sure.

362
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:22,590
Seemed like they were 
getting paid to protect him.

363
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:25,000
- Hey, is that true?
- Huh?

364
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,830
Yes.

365
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:29,220
How many were there?

366
00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:32,130
Let's see...

367
00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:34,070
two...

368
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,650
Seemed like more than 10.

369
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,300
Dang... It's so complicated.

370
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,600
Okay, you can leave.

371
00:23:56,350 --> 00:23:58,780
Why did you lie like that?

372
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:01,090
We'd get our a** kicked 
if he finds out.

373
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:03,730
That won't happen, you stupid.

374
00:24:03,730 --> 00:24:06,690
Didn't you see him get scared 
when I said more than 10?

375
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:12,420
Greet me properly, you bastard!

376
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:20,240
Same position. Same position!

377
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:24,390
Are you playing with me?

378
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:27,090
Why is it taking you 
so long to get an idiot?

379
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:28,410
It's because...

380
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:31,730
the neighborhood thugs are interfering 
and I can't handle it on my own.

381
00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:34,120
So frustrating...

382
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:35,940
So...

383
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:38,570
I just need to get rid 
of the thugs, right?

384
00:24:38,570 --> 00:24:40,160
Yes, but...

385
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:42,890
What?

386
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:45,590
I thought you didn't have any 
power to gather everyone.

387
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:50,640
So, so what?

388
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,580
Do you think I'm stupid?

389
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:54,170
No.

390
00:24:54,170 --> 00:24:57,430
We're not the only group, you know.

391
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:12,390
What's up?

392
00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:15,260
 You can gather guys without 
Gang Hoon's approval, right? 

393
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:17,500
Yeah, except for the seniors.

394
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:18,830
But why?

395
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:20,930
I need to ask you a favor.

396
00:25:20,930 --> 00:25:23,780
I'll make it worth it.

397
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:26,010
Our guys are expensive.

398
00:25:26,010 --> 00:25:28,170
I'll treat you later.

399
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:30,950
So tell me.

400
00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:39,230
- Did you call us, Sunbaenim?
- Hi.

401
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:42,380
Gather all the 10th and 11th 
graders by tomorrow.

402
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:43,910
We have a job to do.

403
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:45,340
Yes.

404
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:46,940
But...

405
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:48,390
Sunbae?

406
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:49,440
What?

407
00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:53,170
Should I call Jin Hwan hyung, too?

408
00:25:53,170 --> 00:25:54,670
No, not him.

409
00:25:54,670 --> 00:25:56,530
Not big enough for him
 to be involved.

410
00:25:56,530 --> 00:26:00,610
Besides, that bastard 
won't listen to me.

411
00:26:00,610 --> 00:26:02,110
Got it.

412
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,530
Okay, ready.

413
00:26:04,530 --> 00:26:07,210
One, two, three.

414
00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:10,590
Yes, good job. Give me a minute.

415
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,600
Hyuk!

416
00:26:15,610 --> 00:26:19,510
Should we go out to eat 
since we're all together?

417
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:21,370
I have plans already.

418
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,800
Hyuk, don't be like that.

419
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:26,270
I'll be home before midnight.

420
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:30,590
When will he come to his senses?

421
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,070
You want to get it from me!

422
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:38,300
Cut, cut, cut. Brother-in-law.

423
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:40,900
Brother-in-law, what's with 
"You want to get it from me?"

424
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:42,600
You want to get it from me?

425
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:44,220
Listen to this.

426
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:45,790
When you fight,

427
00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:49,240
whoever dominates first has 
a 90% chance of winning.

428
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,980
So how do you do that?

429
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:52,880
You want to die?

430
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,670
I'll rip your mouth apart!

431
00:26:55,670 --> 00:26:57,360
If you say something like this,

432
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,970
it's better than 
"You want to get it from me?"

433
00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:02,350
Here, let's try again.
 I'm coming in, okay?

434
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,170
You want to die?

435
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,650
It's better than I thought.

436
00:27:10,650 --> 00:27:12,090
You have talent.

437
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:15,300
But, brother-in-law.

438
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:17,110
When can we meet...

439
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:19,070
Hyun Sun?

440
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:23,440
I'm going to the hospital tomorrow. 
Want to come with me?

441
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:28,870
It's been a while since she 
met friends, so she'll be happy.

442
00:27:28,870 --> 00:27:30,690
Great!

443
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:33,560
Okay, let's start from one, two again.

444
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:34,970
One, two!

445
00:27:34,970 --> 00:27:36,660
One, two!

446
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:44,260
Take it easy, man.

447
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:46,080
Then let's fight.

448
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:50,200
Dang. Why do you come all 
the way here to steal money?

449
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:52,540
I really don't understand.

450
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:55,010
It's quiet and nice here.

451
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,560
Hey, you!

452
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:01,070
Get lost!

453
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:03,100
- Those bastards. 
 - What is that?

454
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:07,900
Hey, don't butt in 
and just leave, okay?

455
00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:10,140
Hey!

456
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:12,770
If you're able, please help me, huh?

457
00:28:12,770 --> 00:28:16,050
I'm in the wrestling team, so
 I'm not supposed to fistfight.

458
00:28:16,050 --> 00:28:17,820
Why don't you shut up!

459
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:20,460
I said to stop. You'll get hurt!

460
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:23,780
Hey, wrestler. Will you buy us 
food if we help you?

461
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:25,280
I'll buy you meat, too.

462
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:27,020
Yes! Hey, meat, meat!

463
00:28:27,970 --> 00:28:29,460
Aigoo, bastard...

464
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:34,180
Let's help him.

465
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:37,290
Hey, you stay there.

466
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:40,700
Brother-in-law, watch carefully, okay?

467
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,650
Come here.

468
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:49,480
Stay there.

469
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:09,100
I didn't do anything, okay?

470
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:13,460
Why would they bother a wrestler?

471
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:16,510
They're from my school. 
They know I'm on the team.

472
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:20,740
But today, I don't have any money left 
after buying this for my sunbae.

473
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:24,040
Why coffee out of the blue?

474
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:26,680
- Are you sure about that?
- Huh?

475
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,400
What about?

476
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,760
No, nothing.

477
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,610
Seems like you're the leader.

478
00:29:31,610 --> 00:29:33,420
You didn't even fight.

479
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:35,160
I'm a friend.

480
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:41,780
Yeah, right. Wrestler, you 
have to buy us meat.

481
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:44,250
I really don't have any money today,

482
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:46,770
I'll buy after my training is over.

483
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:50,100
- Just come here, right?
 - When?

484
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:52,500
Hey, tell us exactly the date and time.

485
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:55,110
Man, that's enough, Parasite.

486
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:00,000
Anyway, thanks!

487
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:03,300
I'm Pyo Tae Jin.

488
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:04,700
I'm Kang Hyuk.

489
00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:10,030
I'm Gu Bon Hwan.

490
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:13,600
I'm Jae Wook.

491
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,700
I'm Kim...

492
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:37,030
She came again.

493
00:30:43,790 --> 00:30:45,000
Excuse me.

494
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:50,770
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

495
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:56,310
I'm not a weird guy, okay?

496
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:01,900
Wait. This!

497
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:04,180
Hey!

498
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:08,200
What the heck?

499
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,500
 

500
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:22,280
- I'm back.
- Yeah?

501
00:31:23,130 --> 00:31:27,950
I just heard a woman
 screaming. Didn't you?

502
00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:29,540
I'm not sure.

503
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:31,180
I didn't hear anything.

504
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:32,650
Was I wrong?

505
00:31:32,650 --> 00:31:34,510
Did you buy what I asked for?

506
00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:35,510
Yes.

507
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:42,940
Hey, you really! 
If you weren't the ace...

508
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:44,320
Why are you hitting me?

509
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,370
You be quiet!

510
00:31:46,370 --> 00:31:48,000
Maxim!

511
00:31:49,730 --> 00:31:51,640
This is Maxim!

512
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:55,980
What? Are you a 
pervert or something?

513
00:31:57,970 --> 00:31:59,840
Page 72.

514
00:32:02,010 --> 00:32:05,150
Man, why isn't that Parasite here yet?

515
00:32:05,150 --> 00:32:07,080
He acted as if he'd be
 the first one here.

516
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:08,460
He'll be here.

517
00:32:17,990 --> 00:32:20,570
What the heck is wrong with him?

518
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:23,030
Sorry.

519
00:32:23,030 --> 00:32:24,810
I'm a little late.

520
00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:27,020
I had a lot to prepare.

521
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:29,410
Let's go up.

522
00:32:29,410 --> 00:32:31,100
Kyu Soon must be waiting.

523
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,180
What about Dad?

524
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:52,550
You know that he's really busy.

525
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:55,020
He's really worried about us

526
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:57,200
over in the US.

527
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,840
Because of us...

528
00:32:59,910 --> 00:33:02,720
He worries about you a lot, too.

529
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,490
Hyun Sun.

530
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:08,420
Even though it's tough,

531
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:10,980
let's get through this, okay?

532
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,800
Oppa is right here.

533
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,750
Who is it?

534
00:33:20,210 --> 00:33:21,300
Hi, Kyu Soon.

535
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:24,630
- Who are...
- It's okay, Hyun Sun.

536
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:26,100
These are my friends.

537
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:27,340
It's okay. You're okay.

538
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:32,130
Ever since that incident, she gets 
anxious around strangers.

539
00:33:32,130 --> 00:33:34,420
Please understand.

540
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:36,310
Hyun Sun.

541
00:33:36,310 --> 00:33:38,670
This is Bon Hwan oppa.

542
00:33:38,670 --> 00:33:39,930
He's really fun.

543
00:33:39,930 --> 00:33:41,930
Hello, Hyun Sun. I'm your new Oppa.

544
00:33:41,930 --> 00:33:44,130
And this is Jae Wook Oppa.

545
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:45,910
Hi, Hyun Sun.

546
00:33:45,910 --> 00:33:47,310
Isn't he cool?

547
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:50,130
This is Hyuk...

548
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,700
A gift.

549
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:58,000
So cool.

550
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,300
They're all nice oppas.

551
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:16,400
Jong Il, is something wrong?

552
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:20,100
I really don't like this.

553
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:21,900
What?

554
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,100
Just all of this.

555
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:29,100
This is nothing but what thugs do.

556
00:34:35,290 --> 00:34:38,060
What can we do when 
sunbaes order us?

557
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:41,650
I'll do everything, 
so you just stay here.

558
00:34:42,870 --> 00:34:44,650
I don't know.

559
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:46,500
I just don't like this.

560
00:34:48,130 --> 00:34:50,160
Hey, Kim Jong Il.

561
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:52,920
What will do you about it?

562
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:54,310
Huh?

563
00:34:54,310 --> 00:34:56,870
If you don't like it, go above sunbae

564
00:34:56,870 --> 00:34:58,750
and say, "I don't want to do this."

565
00:34:58,750 --> 00:35:00,720
Do that then.

566
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:03,730
You act like you're the leader here.

567
00:35:03,730 --> 00:35:07,300
- We were just talking...
- Don't touch me, you bastard.

568
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:10,150
Because you always protect him,

569
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:12,960
he doesn't know his place 
and is getting out of line.

570
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:18,090
Wake up, you bastard.

571
00:35:18,090 --> 00:35:20,800
You're the lowest in rank here.

572
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,400
Well...

573
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:25,280
you have to abide by order of ranks.

574
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,190
Jong Il,

575
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:28,890
you don't like it?

576
00:35:28,890 --> 00:35:31,520
- I'm asking if you don't like this.
- No, stop.

577
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:36,830
I'm watching you.

578
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:45,940
Wow...

579
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
A gift.

580
00:35:47,870 --> 00:35:50,440
You're so cool.

581
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:52,180
I'm baffled.

582
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:54,380
Hyun Sun only greeted Hyuk.

583
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:56,530
My pride hurts.

584
00:35:56,530 --> 00:35:59,740
She didn't even look at me.
 Let's stop it here.

585
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:02,890
What do you mean stop?

586
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:05,200
Aren't they the ones?

587
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,100
She's so pretty.

588
00:36:08,170 --> 00:36:09,570
They are.

589
00:36:11,110 --> 00:36:12,740
Who the heck are they?

590
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:15,020
There are only three?

591
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:17,140
They said there are more than 10.

592
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:20,230
They probably don't roam 
around with them.

593
00:36:22,170 --> 00:36:24,350
You're Kim Kyu Soon, right?

594
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:26,890
We have some business 
with that punk.

595
00:36:26,890 --> 00:36:28,730
You won't hand him over, will you?

596
00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:30,240
You got that right.

597
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,780
It's not too late.

598
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:34,230
If you hand him over, 
nothing will happen.

599
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,900
You're so kind.

600
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:41,440
- Hey, you want a suggestion?
- What?

601
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:45,200
If you disappear right now, 
nothing will happen.

602
00:36:50,130 --> 00:36:52,290
- Let's start.
- Yeah, let's start. Come here.

603
00:37:05,870 --> 00:37:07,440
Are you a middle schooler?

604
00:37:19,950 --> 00:37:21,540
Yeah, you are!

605
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:47,840
Come here.

606
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,680
It's not over yet.

607
00:37:53,270 --> 00:37:54,800
No more.

608
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,240
I'll take it from here.

609
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,510
I'm still okay.

610
00:37:57,510 --> 00:37:59,470
I'll take care of it so 
don't do anything.

611
00:37:59,470 --> 00:38:01,220
It's not okay with me.

612
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,180
We're switching players.

613
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:05,330
No complaints, huh?

614
00:38:05,330 --> 00:38:06,790
As you wish.

615
00:38:06,790 --> 00:38:09,200
What will you do?

616
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:16,080
That's okay. Don't worry.

617
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:19,000
Hyuk will end it right away.

618
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:25,110
Did you hear about the fight
 to decide the ranks tomorrow?

619
00:38:25,110 --> 00:38:27,030
I'm listening right now.

620
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:28,790
What will you do?

621
00:38:28,790 --> 00:38:30,620
Hey.

622
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:33,700
We agreed to stay low in high school.

623
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:37,770
If we're on the bottom, they'll step 
all over us for three years.

624
00:38:37,770 --> 00:38:41,080
I'm really not interested, 
so you fight if you want to.

625
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:44,700
I'll say this one last time.

626
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:48,200
Just hand him over.

627
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,650
Then we'll leave right away.

628
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:55,300
Do you sell out your friend?

629
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:57,850
That's right.

630
00:38:57,850 --> 00:39:01,470
I would've said the same 
thing in your shoes.

631
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:44,400
What is that?

632
00:39:46,610 --> 00:39:47,450
What's that?

633
00:39:48,230 --> 00:39:48,960
What?

634
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:53,880
Hey, where are you going?

635
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,930
You're all scared.

636
00:39:55,930 --> 00:39:57,520
Don't ever come back!

637
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,660
Hey, say bye.

638
00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:02,090
Hey, it's the police. Let's run.

639
00:40:02,090 --> 00:40:03,740
Why are we running?

640
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:06,030
Even if we didn't do anything, 
they'll hassle us. Hurry.

641
00:40:06,030 --> 00:40:09,330
Hey, run, run, run!

642
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:18,410
Run! Run!

643
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:53,050
Hey, they're not chasing us, right?

644
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:55,700
- They're not chasing us, right?
 - Yeah, we lost them.

645
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:04,500
Anyway, what was the deal 
with that short dude?

646
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:07,280
He's the first one to fight 
Hyuk like that, right?

647
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,860
- I'm sorry.
- Huh?

648
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:10,140
What for?

649
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:12,290
This is all because of me.

650
00:41:12,290 --> 00:41:14,410
But there was nothing I could do.

651
00:41:14,410 --> 00:41:16,990
I was wondering what you were saying.

652
00:41:16,990 --> 00:41:19,530
Hey, don't worry about 
things like that, okay?

653
00:41:19,530 --> 00:41:21,050
It's a sign.

654
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:22,800
- A sign.
 - Huh?

655
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:26,700
The ones bothering you and your 
sister should be sorry. Not you.

656
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:28,510
Don't worry about it.

657
00:41:29,730 --> 00:41:31,240
Thank you.

658
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:32,990
I really thank you.

659
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:36,920
And despite that,
 if you want to treat us

660
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:38,720
you can buy us some meat.

661
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:41,180
Please, stop talking 
about eating, okay?

662
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:43,700
Okay! Let's go and eat.

663
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:45,500
You don't have to 
spend money on us.

664
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:46,990
No.

665
00:41:46,990 --> 00:41:50,890
I'm not being mugged. 
I'm treating my friends.

666
00:41:50,890 --> 00:41:52,520
Okay!

667
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:54,340
See? See?

668
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:57,510
What do you like? I like those...

669
00:41:57,510 --> 00:41:59,840
great deep fried veggies...

670
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:02,000
bam, bam, chomp it down...

671
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:07,700
 

672
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:10,620
Kim Jong Il, step forward.

673
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,300
- Say what you want to say.
 - I'm sorry.

674
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:17,710
Hey, hey.

675
00:42:17,710 --> 00:42:19,330
What are you doing?

676
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,300
Jong Il must be hurting.

677
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:26,690
If you wanted to hide your skills, 
you should've done a better job.

678
00:42:26,690 --> 00:42:29,760
Why did you show off 
and get beat up? Huh?

679
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:32,000
I want to knife you all over.

680
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:36,000
Aigoo, see how he stares.

681
00:42:36,030 --> 00:42:38,340
I want to dig out your eyeballs.

682
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:39,770
Hey.

683
00:42:39,770 --> 00:42:41,930
Are you butting in?

684
00:42:41,930 --> 00:42:43,620
You crazy?

685
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:45,730
You think you're a sunbae to me, huh?

686
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:47,340
I'm a senior.

687
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:49,310
Pay the proper respect.

688
00:42:49,310 --> 00:42:53,130
Man, this bastard is annoying me.

689
00:43:08,010 --> 00:43:10,540
I heard something from Dae Gi.

690
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:17,600
Kim Jong Il.

691
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:19,900
Yes.

692
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:21,200
Why did you do that?

693
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:24,370
I'm sorry.

694
00:43:24,370 --> 00:43:25,970
I wanted to stay low.

695
00:43:25,970 --> 00:43:28,940
Then, you should've never joined.

696
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:31,640
Was anyone forced 
to join our group?

697
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:32,780
 No, there aren't!  

698
00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:34,250
I'll say this again.

699
00:43:34,250 --> 00:43:37,380
You have the freedom 
to join us or not.

700
00:43:38,620 --> 00:43:40,020
Kim Jong Il.

701
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:41,140
Yes.

702
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:42,590
You want to leave the group?

703
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,100
Yes.

704
00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:47,850
There is nothing I can do
 if that's what you want.

705
00:43:47,850 --> 00:43:50,030
Just promise me one thing.

706
00:43:50,030 --> 00:43:52,340
The moment you leave,

707
00:43:52,340 --> 00:43:54,060
don't ever fight.

708
00:43:54,060 --> 00:43:55,180
What?

709
00:43:55,180 --> 00:43:57,630
If you don't keep that promise,

710
00:43:57,630 --> 00:43:59,990
you'll pay the consequences.

711
00:43:59,990 --> 00:44:01,690
That will...

712
00:44:01,690 --> 00:44:03,450
never happen.

713
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:11,680
I trust you.

714
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:14,500
From now on, 11th grade Kim Jong Il

715
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:17,610
- is out of the group.
  - Yes! 

716
00:44:17,610 --> 00:44:19,050
You may leave.

717
00:44:19,050 --> 00:44:21,120
We have something to talk about.

718
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:24,360
Thank you.

719
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:27,100
Thank you, Sunbaenim.

720
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:37,700
Who went to the same 
junior high with Jong Il?

721
00:44:41,050 --> 00:44:43,420
- You're the only one?
- Yes.

722
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:45,680
- You knew, right?
- Yes.

723
00:44:49,130 --> 00:44:53,000
You will go down to the lowest 
in 11th grade ranking.

724
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:56,700
Aigoo. Let's go.

725
00:44:56,700 --> 00:44:59,780
You'll get some beating today.

726
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:02,640
Take it easy, man.

727
00:45:05,030 --> 00:45:06,540
Kim Dae Gi.

728
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:07,850
Yes.

729
00:45:07,850 --> 00:45:10,990
From now on, you're the 
second in 11th grade ranking.

730
00:45:12,150 --> 00:45:13,350
Thank you!

731
00:45:13,350 --> 00:45:15,330
You're in the same class 
with Jong Il, right?

732
00:45:15,330 --> 00:45:16,660
Yes.

733
00:45:16,660 --> 00:45:19,950
What do you think you
 need to do from now on?

734
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:22,550
Well...

735
00:45:23,910 --> 00:45:26,080
I have to do something to Jong Il.

736
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:27,160
Why Jong Il?

737
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:29,870
Gang Hoon allowed him 
to leave the group.

738
00:45:29,870 --> 00:45:31,160
Who do you think you are?

739
00:45:32,270 --> 00:45:34,240
- Then...
- Is there anyone to bully in your class?

740
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:37,700
Yes, there is. He's deaf.

741
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:40,270
- He's someone we can bully.
- Good.

742
00:45:40,270 --> 00:45:41,590
Yes.

743
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:44,480
Everyone, leave!

744
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:51,200
This is enough for inside matters.

745
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:53,700
Should we start taking care 
of outside matters now?

746
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:55,860
Who?

747
00:45:55,860 --> 00:45:57,180
Sung Kyu?

748
00:45:57,180 --> 00:45:59,250
I approved it.

749
00:45:59,250 --> 00:46:00,770
I know.

750
00:46:00,770 --> 00:46:02,620
I know, but...

751
00:46:02,620 --> 00:46:06,020
Since I thought about it, 
I should stomp on him.

752
00:46:06,020 --> 00:46:09,960
I let him hang around me for
 a few months and now

753
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:12,640
he acts like he's my equal.

754
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:16,810
Looks like she called. 
Isn't she pretty?

755
00:46:24,980 --> 00:46:28,220
 

756
00:46:30,690 --> 00:46:32,250
Hello.

757
00:46:32,250 --> 00:46:33,820
Yeah, why?

758
00:46:38,790 --> 00:46:40,630
What do you mean?

759
00:46:40,630 --> 00:46:42,790
When did we ask for help?

760
00:46:43,810 --> 00:46:45,700
I don't know anything about that.

761
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:48,150
Allies can help each other.

762
00:46:48,150 --> 00:46:51,260
But the reason why I'm really pissed

763
00:46:51,260 --> 00:46:54,190
is the fact that you didn't 
discuss it with me at all.

764
00:46:54,190 --> 00:46:58,290
Hey, Gang Hoon, seems like there
 is a misunderstanding.

765
00:46:58,290 --> 00:47:01,610
This is really my first 
time hearing this.

766
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:03,460
Don't you trust me?

767
00:47:04,730 --> 00:47:07,710
It's not important whether 
you knew or not.

768
00:47:07,710 --> 00:47:09,360
 Okay. I got it. 

769
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:11,810
 Whatever happened, this time around 

770
00:47:11,810 --> 00:47:14,110
we're sorry.

771
00:47:14,110 --> 00:47:17,330
We'll assess the situation and 
take care of our guys, okay?

772
00:47:17,330 --> 00:47:19,380
 Our guys got hurt pretty bad 

773
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:21,380
 Huh? 

774
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:24,830
 Shouldn't you take the 
injured guys out to eat? 

775
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:27,900
I was wondering what 
you were talking about.

776
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:31,360
Fine. Money is not an issue for us.

777
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,500
 I'll take care... 

778
00:47:48,950 --> 00:47:51,160
Where is Shin Do Yoon?

779
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:58,060
♫  You were there in those times  ♫

780
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:05,040
♫  We'll go through it together   ♫

781
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:09,610
♫  I can have a new dream of my life  ♫

782
00:48:09,610 --> 00:48:13,180
♫  For the first time, first time, yeah  ♫

783
00:48:13,180 --> 00:48:17,070
♫  I can't do this alone, come on  ♫
