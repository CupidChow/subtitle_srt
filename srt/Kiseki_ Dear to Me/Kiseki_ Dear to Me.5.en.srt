=KISEKI: Dear to Me=
=Episode 5=

18
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,381
- It's time for me to...
- Five more cans left.

19
00:01:32,582 --> 00:01:33,416
I'll get them.

20
00:01:42,325 --> 00:01:43,493
Are you trying to make me stay?

21
00:01:46,162 --> 00:01:47,397
What? No way.

22
00:02:08,952 --> 00:02:09,886
I'll get the door.

23
00:02:17,894 --> 00:02:19,295
Hi.

24
00:02:19,996 --> 00:02:20,897
You are...

25
00:02:21,297 --> 00:02:22,565
Rui.

26
00:02:22,565 --> 00:02:24,801
I've been looking for you
for a long time.

27
00:02:24,801 --> 00:02:26,169
Who told you I'm here?

28
00:02:26,169 --> 00:02:28,304
You never stay in one place.

29
00:02:30,039 --> 00:02:30,840
(We promised each other)

30
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,975
that if on our birthday,

31
00:02:31,975 --> 00:02:32,742
we both still live,

32
00:02:32,742 --> 00:02:34,210
we will celebrate it together.

33
00:02:36,146 --> 00:02:36,913
He's your friend?

34
00:02:38,781 --> 00:02:39,582
Yes.

35
00:02:40,583 --> 00:02:41,518
Get up.

36
00:02:41,951 --> 00:02:43,086
No!

37
00:02:43,953 --> 00:02:44,654
Ai Di.

38
00:02:44,654 --> 00:02:46,022
Just let me do this.

39
00:02:48,925 --> 00:02:50,260
Get up.

40
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:51,327
No.

41
00:02:58,935 --> 00:03:00,436
If it's you that I fall in love with,

42
00:03:00,436 --> 00:03:02,205
maybe I won't be that miserable.

43
00:03:03,373 --> 00:03:05,208
You're so not my type.

44
00:03:09,512 --> 00:03:10,914
You're not drunk. Stop pretending.

45
00:03:10,914 --> 00:03:12,115
It makes you look pathetic.

46
00:03:14,584 --> 00:03:16,819
It's not my fault
that there are only beers here.

47
00:03:23,226 --> 00:03:24,394
Sit properly if you want to eat.

48
00:03:25,962 --> 00:03:27,030
Sit properly.

49
00:03:31,267 --> 00:03:34,404
You look familiar.

50
00:03:34,871 --> 00:03:36,139
We met before.

51
00:03:36,139 --> 00:03:37,507
You were choosing a cake

52
00:03:37,974 --> 00:03:39,676
because you wanted to celebrate
your birthday with a friend.

53
00:03:40,643 --> 00:03:41,778
I don't know what happened

54
00:03:41,778 --> 00:03:43,279
between you and your friend,

55
00:03:44,347 --> 00:03:46,015
but celebrating your birthday

56
00:03:46,349 --> 00:03:48,284
with people you like
will make you extra happy.

57
00:03:49,085 --> 00:03:50,386
Someone has to make the first move,
right?

58
00:03:51,721 --> 00:03:53,256
It's you.

59
00:03:53,623 --> 00:03:55,758
Thanks to your suggestion,
I was stood up like an idiot.

60
00:03:56,693 --> 00:03:57,393
Stand right there.

61
00:03:57,393 --> 00:03:58,361
Let me punch you.

62
00:03:58,361 --> 00:03:59,829
Calm down.

63
00:03:59,829 --> 00:04:00,496
Sit.

64
00:04:02,532 --> 00:04:03,733
Eat with us.

65
00:04:04,834 --> 00:04:05,602
I need to study for AST.

66
00:04:05,602 --> 00:04:06,769
No time to idle around with you.

67
00:04:15,612 --> 00:04:17,180
Why am I so angry?

68
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:21,584
He's pissed.

69
00:04:22,719 --> 00:04:24,420
Why is he mad again?

70
00:04:31,995 --> 00:04:33,596
Stop it.

71
00:04:35,932 --> 00:04:36,699
Come.

72
00:04:36,699 --> 00:04:37,400
What?

73
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:37,900
Drink.

74
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:38,534
Sure.

75
00:04:38,534 --> 00:04:39,869
Don't you want to get wasted?

76
00:04:42,739 --> 00:04:43,973
Beer is nothing.

77
00:04:45,108 --> 00:04:46,309
Why can't you give up on him?

78
00:04:50,413 --> 00:04:51,848
I already told you why.

79
00:04:51,848 --> 00:04:53,516
It's been four years already.

80
00:04:53,516 --> 00:04:54,817
But you won't move on.

81
00:04:54,817 --> 00:04:56,219
What four years?

82
00:04:57,587 --> 00:04:58,488
You have a crush on him
for four years, no?

83
00:04:58,488 --> 00:05:00,556
It's much longer than that.

84
00:05:17,173 --> 00:05:17,940
Ai Di.

85
00:05:18,675 --> 00:05:19,909
Ai Di.

86
00:05:19,909 --> 00:05:20,810
Get up.

87
00:05:21,377 --> 00:05:23,079
Don't fall asleep here.

88
00:05:23,413 --> 00:05:24,213
I'll handle him.

89
00:05:25,982 --> 00:05:26,716
Let me.

90
00:05:32,255 --> 00:05:33,623
Shouldn't you knock first?

91
00:05:33,623 --> 00:05:34,590
The door is open.

92
00:05:37,026 --> 00:05:38,127
I'll deal with this.

93
00:05:38,127 --> 00:05:39,796
It's definitely on you.

94
00:05:39,796 --> 00:05:41,364
Who told you that I'm here?

95
00:05:41,964 --> 00:05:43,366
We have our ways.

96
00:05:49,772 --> 00:05:50,506
Let's go,

97
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:51,674
Rui.

98
00:05:57,547 --> 00:05:58,348
You guys go first.

99
00:05:58,348 --> 00:05:59,282
I still have things to do.

100
00:06:02,452 --> 00:06:03,219
Chen Yi.

101
00:06:07,557 --> 00:06:09,025
What is Ai Di to you?

102
00:06:10,393 --> 00:06:11,260
A good friend.

103
00:06:12,195 --> 00:06:13,796
And what do you think of Boss?

104
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,602
Love and admiration are different.

105
00:06:19,602 --> 00:06:20,870
Think it through.

106
00:06:26,142 --> 00:06:27,143
Is that for me

107
00:06:28,277 --> 00:06:29,679
or for you?

108
00:06:41,891 --> 00:06:43,326
He likes Ai Di.

109
00:06:44,327 --> 00:06:45,395
How do you know?

110
00:06:46,028 --> 00:06:47,530
I could feel it.

111
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:49,132
He holds Ai Di dearly.

112
00:06:49,132 --> 00:06:50,900
He is the one Ai Di wanted
to spend his birthday with.

113
00:06:51,701 --> 00:06:52,602
Yes.

114
00:06:54,003 --> 00:06:55,138
And you...

115
00:06:57,907 --> 00:06:59,575
Why did you pretend to be a teacher
and come to my school?

116
00:06:59,575 --> 00:07:00,543
Who are you?

117
00:07:03,546 --> 00:07:05,481
I don't want to lie to you

118
00:07:05,481 --> 00:07:07,817
but I can't tell you everything
at the moment.

119
00:07:09,185 --> 00:07:11,020
I'm sorry that I said

120
00:07:11,554 --> 00:07:12,422
those nasty things to you.

121
00:07:13,289 --> 00:07:14,791
I don't mean it. Truly.

122
00:07:14,791 --> 00:07:15,658
So please,

123
00:07:16,459 --> 00:07:18,494
act like we have never met.

124
00:07:18,494 --> 00:07:20,296
I'm just a substitute teacher,

125
00:07:20,997 --> 00:07:22,064
okay?

126
00:07:25,168 --> 00:07:26,869
But when the time is right,
you must tell me the truth.

127
00:07:27,503 --> 00:07:29,138
I promise.

128
00:07:35,344 --> 00:07:36,612
Are you...

129
00:07:36,612 --> 00:07:37,980
I haven't finished my beer!

130
00:07:38,214 --> 00:07:39,882
Yes, you need to finish them first.

131
00:08:23,426 --> 00:08:25,161
(What is Ai Di to you?)

132
00:08:27,363 --> 00:08:29,298
(Love and admiration are different.)

133
00:08:29,298 --> 00:08:30,600
(Think it through.)

134
00:08:40,243 --> 00:08:41,477
Don't make me worry about you.

135
00:09:14,043 --> 00:09:14,877
(Bai Zongyi.)

136
00:09:15,177 --> 00:09:16,612
Morning.

137
00:09:17,513 --> 00:09:18,581
You're in a good mood today.

138
00:09:18,581 --> 00:09:19,282
You had a naughty dream?

139
00:09:19,582 --> 00:09:20,616
No.

140
00:09:20,616 --> 00:09:21,584
Then why?

141
00:09:25,187 --> 00:09:26,122
My cat returned.

142
00:09:27,089 --> 00:09:28,591
That's all?

143
00:09:28,591 --> 00:09:29,725
You're now a slave to your cat.

144
00:09:29,725 --> 00:09:30,793
No way.

145
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,194
We have a maths pop quiz today.

146
00:09:32,194 --> 00:09:33,162
Help me.

147
00:09:35,998 --> 00:09:36,999
Are you sure this list

148
00:09:36,999 --> 00:09:38,534
contains

149
00:09:38,534 --> 00:09:40,002
all the suspicious students?

150
00:09:40,002 --> 00:09:41,137
Yes,

151
00:09:41,137 --> 00:09:42,471
that's all to it.

152
00:09:42,838 --> 00:09:43,439
Okay.

153
00:09:43,439 --> 00:09:45,541
I will go through them one by one.

154
00:09:46,075 --> 00:09:47,677
Thank you, Mr. Fan.

155
00:09:48,411 --> 00:09:51,180
- It's Mr. Gao.
- Yes, Mr. Gao.

156
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:52,415
The office needs me.

157
00:09:52,415 --> 00:09:53,449
I should go now.

158
00:10:06,862 --> 00:10:08,264
I have a crush on you.

159
00:10:08,264 --> 00:10:09,365
Can you be my boyfriend?

160
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:11,267
You wrote here

161
00:10:11,267 --> 00:10:13,069
that you had a job offer for me.

162
00:10:13,502 --> 00:10:15,771
I don't know what else
can make you show up.

163
00:10:15,771 --> 00:10:17,740
You work a lot.

164
00:10:17,974 --> 00:10:18,975
So can you

165
00:10:18,975 --> 00:10:20,443
be my boyfriend?

166
00:10:20,443 --> 00:10:22,144
Being my boyfriend will benefit you.

167
00:10:22,144 --> 00:10:23,212
What benefits?

168
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,982
My mom is the president
of the parent committee.

169
00:10:25,982 --> 00:10:27,183
I can make things easier for you.

170
00:10:27,883 --> 00:10:28,884
So?

171
00:10:28,884 --> 00:10:30,119
Date me.

172
00:10:30,119 --> 00:10:30,953
Yes

173
00:10:30,953 --> 00:10:32,588
or no?

174
00:10:32,855 --> 00:10:33,589
No, sorry.

175
00:10:34,357 --> 00:10:35,257
Bai Zongyi!

176
00:10:36,359 --> 00:10:37,960
Know your worth now.

177
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:38,694
I

178
00:10:38,694 --> 00:10:39,962
confessed to you.

179
00:10:39,962 --> 00:10:41,430
How could you reject me?

180
00:10:42,465 --> 00:10:43,265
Think of it

181
00:10:43,265 --> 00:10:44,967
as another gig.

182
00:10:44,967 --> 00:10:46,636
I'll give you 500
if you go on a date with me.

183
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:48,971
You want money, don't you?

184
00:10:48,971 --> 00:10:50,206
Because you sell your notes.

185
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,941
I know you're rich.

186
00:10:51,941 --> 00:10:52,842
But I don't care.

187
00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:56,712
How could you yell at me, Bai Zongyi?

188
00:10:56,712 --> 00:10:57,880
It's not like I'm wrong.

189
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:00,316
I'll make you pay for humiliating me.

190
00:11:00,316 --> 00:11:01,584
Bai Zongyi!

191
00:11:03,753 --> 00:11:05,121
Popular, aren't you?

192
00:11:08,057 --> 00:11:10,226
You're just like her.
You bully others with your money.

193
00:11:11,193 --> 00:11:12,995
Yes, I'm poor and penny-pinching.

194
00:11:12,995 --> 00:11:14,897
But that doesn't mean I'll sell
my soul for money.

195
00:11:14,897 --> 00:11:16,032
Don't insult me.

196
00:11:17,033 --> 00:11:19,268
Bai Zongyi, why are you mad at me?

197
00:11:22,204 --> 00:11:22,972
Sorry.

198
00:11:23,873 --> 00:11:24,640
We reached an agreement
to pretend we don't know each other.

199
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,541
Ignore me.

200
00:11:47,697 --> 00:11:48,864
I found the mouse.

201
00:11:55,104 --> 00:11:55,971
Rui.

202
00:11:56,772 --> 00:11:58,307
Are you sure Zhang Teng is here?

203
00:12:02,011 --> 00:12:04,113
Following the route he took

204
00:12:04,113 --> 00:12:05,548
that the security cameras showed us,

205
00:12:05,548 --> 00:12:07,249
he's most likely to be hiding there.

206
00:12:07,683 --> 00:12:08,884
Jie,

207
00:12:08,884 --> 00:12:09,852
bring two other guys with you
and take care of the rear.

208
00:12:09,852 --> 00:12:10,820
Noted, Mr. Yi.

209
00:12:16,459 --> 00:12:17,860
I hate this place!

210
00:12:24,967 --> 00:12:25,534
Zhang Teng!

211
00:12:26,502 --> 00:12:27,603
You again!

212
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:30,740
I'll gouge your eyes out.

Ai Di!

227
00:13:40,009 --> 00:13:40,442
Let's go.

228
00:13:40,442 --> 00:13:41,043
Go.

229
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:42,444
Go.

230
00:13:42,444 --> 00:13:43,179
Boss.

231
00:13:43,179 --> 00:13:43,913
Run.

232
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:49,351
Rui finally found him!

233
00:13:49,351 --> 00:13:50,753
Boss wants us to capture him alive!

234
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:51,887
Now, you listen to Boss.

235
00:13:51,887 --> 00:13:53,422
Why did you defy Boss
and raid Zhang Teng's territory then?

236
00:13:53,422 --> 00:13:54,990
Are you a goody two shoes now?

237
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:55,758
Enough!

238
00:13:56,592 --> 00:13:57,993
Stop arguing.

239
00:13:59,361 --> 00:14:00,563
Are there any casualties?

240
00:14:01,764 --> 00:14:03,299
Only minor injuries. Everyone is fine.

241
00:14:03,799 --> 00:14:05,301
You got in my way.

242
00:14:06,035 --> 00:14:07,169
We can track Zhang Teng down again.

243
00:14:07,169 --> 00:14:08,637
But we cannot defy Boss' order.

244
00:14:09,271 --> 00:14:10,906
We acted on our own so it's our fault.

245
00:14:10,906 --> 00:14:12,208
Quit arguing now.

246
00:14:15,211 --> 00:14:16,011
Fine.

247
00:14:16,912 --> 00:14:18,647
When I'm back, I expect
stir-fried spicy chicken,

248
00:14:19,315 --> 00:14:21,817
braised beef in chili oil,
spicy king oyster mushroom,

249
00:14:21,817 --> 00:14:23,152
sauteed Chinese sausages with garlic,

250
00:14:23,586 --> 00:14:24,787
Sichuanese noodles,

251
00:14:25,754 --> 00:14:26,722
and chili minced meat.

252
00:14:28,591 --> 00:14:29,625
You hear me?

253
00:14:30,459 --> 00:14:31,660
Yes.

254
00:14:44,607 --> 00:14:45,574
You're back.

255
00:14:48,344 --> 00:14:50,246
I cooked a lot today
so I brought some food for you.

256
00:14:50,246 --> 00:14:51,280
I also came

257
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,348
to restock.

258
00:14:55,818 --> 00:14:57,086
How did you come in?

259
00:14:57,887 --> 00:14:59,755
I changed the lock last time,
and I keep a spare key.

260
00:14:59,755 --> 00:15:00,789
Sorry.

261
00:15:03,525 --> 00:15:05,861
I don't mean to bully you
because I have the money

262
00:15:05,861 --> 00:15:07,296
nor do I look down on you.

263
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:09,632
I just want to thank you for your help.

264
00:15:09,632 --> 00:15:11,200
I thought the money
could reduce your burden.

265
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,101
I know.

266
00:15:12,101 --> 00:15:13,869
I'm not mad at you. It's just...

267
00:15:14,203 --> 00:15:15,738
That girl was being a jerk, wasn't she?

268
00:15:16,105 --> 00:15:16,872
I know

269
00:15:16,872 --> 00:15:18,107
you will be a successful doctor
in the future,

270
00:15:18,107 --> 00:15:19,475
and you will be rich.

271
00:15:20,075 --> 00:15:21,810
Nonsense.

272
00:15:23,078 --> 00:15:24,213
What did you bring?

273
00:15:24,546 --> 00:15:25,514
You'll see.

274
00:15:31,587 --> 00:15:32,688
Ai Di loves spicy food

275
00:15:32,688 --> 00:15:34,256
so everything here is spicy.

276
00:15:34,256 --> 00:15:35,090
I don't know if you can take it,

277
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:36,792
so I made some veggies for you too.

278
00:15:49,438 --> 00:15:50,906
Don't just eat the veggies.

279
00:15:51,774 --> 00:15:52,841
Have some meat too.

280
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:58,614
Do you like it?

281
00:15:59,214 --> 00:16:00,382
Veggies are the best.

282
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,288
Eat more then.

283
00:16:06,288 --> 00:16:07,523
You always eat so little.

284
00:16:08,657 --> 00:16:09,692
You look exhausted.

285
00:16:11,026 --> 00:16:12,261
Well,

286
00:16:12,261 --> 00:16:13,963
I have been sleeping late.

287
00:16:14,363 --> 00:16:15,497
Eat up.

288
00:16:16,598 --> 00:16:18,000
Have you eaten then?

289
00:16:18,767 --> 00:16:20,469
I had some when I was cooking.

290
00:16:43,225 --> 00:16:44,526
You're a good chef, you know?

291
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,301
Fan Zherui.

292
00:16:57,673 --> 00:16:58,640
Zherui.

293
00:16:59,375 --> 00:17:00,275
Zherui?

294
00:18:50,886 --> 00:18:52,387
Fan Zherui, you...

295
00:18:52,387 --> 00:18:53,322
Morning.

296
00:18:56,992 --> 00:18:58,093
Did I?

297
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:06,368
Why are you staring at your hand?

298
00:19:07,769 --> 00:19:09,471
I made a mistake.

299
00:19:09,872 --> 00:19:10,806
What mistake?

300
00:19:12,007 --> 00:19:13,675
I ruined innocent young people.

301
00:19:14,109 --> 00:19:15,544
Well, he's not exactly innocent.

302
00:19:15,544 --> 00:19:16,712
There's more to this.

303
00:19:16,712 --> 00:19:18,380
Tell me everything now.

304
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:18,981
No.

305
00:19:18,981 --> 00:19:19,948
You are grinning.

306
00:19:20,182 --> 00:19:21,049
No, I'm not.

307
00:19:21,049 --> 00:19:21,783
But I saw it.

308
00:19:21,783 --> 00:19:22,217
You're grinning.

309
00:19:22,217 --> 00:19:24,786
I'm not. It bothers me.

310
00:19:28,323 --> 00:19:28,957
Tell me.

311
00:19:28,957 --> 00:19:29,791
No.

312
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,095
Did you get anything useful
from the school?

313
00:19:34,496 --> 00:19:36,098
Our target is a slippery one.

314
00:19:37,166 --> 00:19:38,000
If 100 students

315
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,468
take drugs,

316
00:19:39,468 --> 00:19:41,003
only five of them will be caught.

317
00:19:41,637 --> 00:19:42,771
The name list the school gave me

318
00:19:42,771 --> 00:19:44,072
can only be used as a reference.

319
00:19:44,072 --> 00:19:45,941
We need to narrow down the scope.

320
00:19:46,441 --> 00:19:49,344
However, communication has been made
cheap and effective.

321
00:19:49,344 --> 00:19:51,313
One phone call is all it takes.

322
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:53,382
It won't be easy
to pinpoint the culprit.

323
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:56,018
Do we have a choice?

324
00:19:56,418 --> 00:19:58,020
The syndicate's reputation is at stake.

325
00:19:59,388 --> 00:20:00,422
I know.

326
00:20:14,236 --> 00:20:15,737
Settle down now.

327
00:20:16,104 --> 00:20:17,172
The class begins soon.

328
00:20:17,506 --> 00:20:18,874
Quiet!

329
00:20:18,874 --> 00:20:20,142
The teacher's here.

330
00:20:29,184 --> 00:20:30,319
Where is Bai Zongyi?

331
00:20:32,454 --> 00:20:34,056
Ms. Song summoned him.

332
00:20:34,056 --> 00:20:34,923
Why?

333
00:20:35,157 --> 00:20:37,759
We were conducting
a chemistry experiment just now.

334
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:39,428
Jiamei said that Zongyi pulled a prank

335
00:20:39,428 --> 00:20:40,195
and wounded her.

336
00:20:49,838 --> 00:20:51,940
Is Bai Zongyi very important
to Mr. Gao or something?

337
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:53,242
How would I know?

338
00:20:56,745 --> 00:20:58,580
Look at her knees.

339
00:20:59,114 --> 00:21:00,582
You owe us an apology.

340
00:21:00,582 --> 00:21:01,917
Is this what your parents taught you?

341
00:21:02,351 --> 00:21:04,853
Bai Zongyi, apologize now.

342
00:21:04,853 --> 00:21:06,688
I know it's an accident.

343
00:21:06,688 --> 00:21:08,090
So just apologize to Jiamei

344
00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:08,890
and her mother.

345
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:10,325
An accident?

346
00:21:10,325 --> 00:21:11,026
Have you seen her knees?

347
00:21:11,026 --> 00:21:12,227
- Ms. Song.
- Mr. Gao.

348
00:21:12,227 --> 00:21:13,095
I'm dealing

349
00:21:13,095 --> 00:21:14,363
with an emergency now.

350
00:21:14,363 --> 00:21:15,564
I'm here for Bai Zongyi.

351
00:21:17,132 --> 00:21:18,267
I'm Zongyi's cousin.

352
00:21:22,704 --> 00:21:24,806
You're injured. Don't stand.

353
00:21:24,806 --> 00:21:25,807
Sit down, please.

354
00:21:27,609 --> 00:21:28,644
Careful.

355
00:21:29,478 --> 00:21:30,345
Does it hurt?

356
00:21:30,846 --> 00:21:32,447
I didn't pull a prank on her.

357
00:21:35,317 --> 00:21:36,485
It hurts a lot.

358
00:21:37,119 --> 00:21:38,620
Bai Zongyi shoved you?

359
00:21:39,521 --> 00:21:40,122
Yes.

360
00:21:41,823 --> 00:21:43,525
Like this?

361
00:21:43,525 --> 00:21:44,826
That's right.

362
00:21:44,826 --> 00:21:46,094
He approached me

363
00:21:46,094 --> 00:21:47,396
and shoved me.

364
00:21:47,396 --> 00:21:49,064
I then fell to the ground.

365
00:21:49,931 --> 00:21:50,966
It hurts.

366
00:21:51,566 --> 00:21:52,768
Did you hear that?

367
00:21:53,835 --> 00:21:55,203
What an unruly child.

368
00:21:57,005 --> 00:21:57,906
If she was shoved from the front,

369
00:21:57,906 --> 00:22:00,175
she would land on her butt.

370
00:22:00,175 --> 00:22:01,843
Why are her knees bruised then?

371
00:22:06,214 --> 00:22:07,249
What exactly happened?

372
00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:09,518
During the experiment,

373
00:22:09,518 --> 00:22:11,219
she accidentally spilled
some sodium hydroxide.

374
00:22:11,219 --> 00:22:13,021
I was afraid that she would touch it
so I shoved her away.

375
00:22:13,021 --> 00:22:14,623
But then she began accusing me

377

Do you think that's fair?

379
00:22:25,567 --> 00:22:26,535
Mr. Gao...

380
00:22:26,535 --> 00:22:27,469
I'll make myself clear.

If we don't clear things up here,
no one can leave.

382
00:22:30,138 --> 00:22:31,139
It's not right for you

383
00:22:31,139 --> 00:22:32,507
to accuse the people
in my family groundlessly.

384
00:22:49,091 --> 00:22:50,258
How did I do

385
00:22:50,258 --> 00:22:51,393
as your cousin?

that we don't know each other?

The thing I did two days ago...

Do you truly believe
that I didn't bully Wang Jiamei?

393
00:23:13,081 --> 00:23:15,751
Of course not.
You're not someone like that.
