=Episode 10=

18
00:01:57,658 --> 00:02:02,048
(Strawberry cake, Zherui's favorite)

19
00:02:10,947 --> 00:02:12,149
You can try it.

20
00:02:12,149 --> 00:02:13,784
You are always welcome
to provide feedback

21
00:02:13,784 --> 00:02:14,718
and ideas to me.

22
00:02:14,718 --> 00:02:15,385
Okay.

23
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:15,986
Please enjoy.

24
00:02:15,986 --> 00:02:17,187
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

25
00:02:19,523 --> 00:02:21,658
You really love strawberries.

26
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:23,293
Three of the five new items

27
00:02:23,293 --> 00:02:24,995
are strawberry-flavored cakes.

28
00:02:25,529 --> 00:02:26,696
There will be puffs later.

29
00:02:26,696 --> 00:02:28,598
It's the brand-new
custard cream. Try it.

30
00:02:30,267 --> 00:02:31,435
Welcome.

31
00:02:35,705 --> 00:02:38,208
When will you come to your senses?

32
00:02:39,042 --> 00:02:41,311
I'm the only one who will care for you.

33
00:02:46,783 --> 00:02:48,251
You had virgin complex?
It happened long ago.

34
00:02:48,785 --> 00:02:49,986
What's wrong with you?

35
00:02:49,986 --> 00:02:51,488
I'm only doing it for fun that night.

36
00:02:52,022 --> 00:02:54,124
Just for fun, okay?

37
00:03:04,801 --> 00:03:06,669
Mr. Yi, someone's been
picking on Ai Di in a bar.

38
00:03:26,787 --> 00:03:29,790
You dyed your hair blonde
when studying abroad.

39
00:03:30,557 --> 00:03:32,426
Di Di.

40
00:03:32,426 --> 00:03:34,394
Don't call me that. I'm warning you.

41
00:03:34,761 --> 00:03:35,863
Why do you have a hot temper

42
00:03:35,863 --> 00:03:37,297
after coming back?

43
00:03:37,297 --> 00:03:38,465
What's the matter?

44
00:03:39,133 --> 00:03:41,735
Why is he treating me like this?

45
00:03:41,735 --> 00:03:43,971
We've been together for so long.

46
00:03:43,971 --> 00:03:45,272
Doesn't he understand me?

47
00:03:45,272 --> 00:03:46,807
Okay, okay. It's fine.

48
00:03:46,807 --> 00:03:48,976
Am I not making it clear enough?

49
00:03:48,976 --> 00:03:50,277
Let it go.

50
00:03:50,277 --> 00:03:51,645
Why can't he see it?

51
00:03:53,714 --> 00:03:55,282
I also want to know the reason.

52
00:03:55,749 --> 00:03:58,085
Is it because we are so close?

53
00:03:58,752 --> 00:03:59,553
What do you mean?

54
00:03:59,553 --> 00:04:00,420
Well.

55
00:04:00,921 --> 00:04:01,588
Check it out.

56
00:04:01,588 --> 00:04:04,191
When we are close,
I can't see you clearly.

57
00:04:04,191 --> 00:04:05,626
When we stay away from each other,

58
00:04:05,626 --> 00:04:07,628
I can see you clearly.

59
00:04:07,628 --> 00:04:09,062
When we are close,
I can't see you clearly.

60
00:04:09,062 --> 00:04:10,030
I can't see you clearly.

61
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:11,632
Now, I can see you clearly.

62
00:04:12,399 --> 00:04:14,134
So cute.

63
00:04:18,205 --> 00:04:19,173
I've looked for you for long.

64
00:04:19,173 --> 00:04:20,007
You're here.

65
00:04:23,343 --> 00:04:24,411
Come back with me.

66
00:04:24,411 --> 00:04:25,512
Where shall we go?

67
00:04:26,013 --> 00:04:27,814
I have nothing to do with you anymore.

68
00:04:27,814 --> 00:04:29,216
I don't live there anymore.
Let go of me.

69
00:04:29,917 --> 00:04:30,717
Are you going or not?

70
00:04:30,717 --> 00:04:31,752
I'm not going.

71
00:04:31,752 --> 00:04:32,686
Back then,

72
00:04:32,686 --> 00:04:34,000
Boss said this bar is mine.

73
00:04:34,563 --> 00:04:35,664
You are not welcome here!

74
00:04:35,664 --> 00:04:36,665
Get out!

75
00:04:38,366 --> 00:04:39,267
- Leave here!
- Get out!

76
00:04:40,001 --> 00:04:40,835
Leave here!

77
00:04:40,835 --> 00:04:42,170
- Hurry up!
- Turn off the music!

78
00:04:47,209 --> 00:04:48,443
Don't ever

79
00:04:48,443 --> 00:04:52,047
put mayonnaise on my fried egg again.

80
00:04:52,847 --> 00:04:54,316
That's the best way to enjoy it.

81
00:04:54,316 --> 00:04:56,218
Soy sauce is essential

82
00:04:56,218 --> 00:04:58,086
for a fried egg.

83
00:04:58,086 --> 00:04:59,421
Just like us.

84
00:04:59,854 --> 00:05:02,123
We're the perfect match,

85
00:05:02,123 --> 00:05:03,391
got it?

86
00:05:04,659 --> 00:05:05,727
After all this time together,

87
00:05:05,727 --> 00:05:07,495
how could you possibly not get it?

88
00:05:08,663 --> 00:05:09,798
Leave here!

89
00:05:11,466 --> 00:05:12,434
Naruto.

90
00:05:12,434 --> 00:05:13,568
What is that?

91
00:05:14,035 --> 00:05:16,171
Come here.

92
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:23,545
Don't touch me!

93
00:05:23,545 --> 00:05:25,413
Do you think I'm an emotionless corpse?

94
00:05:25,981 --> 00:05:27,015
How do you feel?

95
00:05:35,991 --> 00:05:36,825
What do you want?

96
00:05:39,027 --> 00:05:39,761
I don't know.

97
00:05:41,863 --> 00:05:43,064
We've been friends since childhood,

98
00:05:43,064 --> 00:05:44,199
but I'm realizing how little

99
00:05:45,033 --> 00:05:45,867
I know about you.

100
00:05:47,068 --> 00:05:48,470
Is the man your ideal type?

101
00:05:50,905 --> 00:05:52,107
You actually let him hold you?

102
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,642
He was drunk.

103
00:05:54,676 --> 00:05:56,544
Didn't you notice he's taken?

104
00:05:56,978 --> 00:05:58,346
I'm also picky.

105
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:03,385
What about me?

106
00:06:06,321 --> 00:06:07,989
Again. What's wrong with you?

107
00:06:08,857 --> 00:06:10,458
Can you just put it out of your mind?

108
00:06:10,458 --> 00:06:12,193
It's just about a night.

109
00:06:12,494 --> 00:06:14,396
Why did you enter prison
to protect Bai Zongyi?

110
00:06:16,197 --> 00:06:17,699
Because he is my friend.

111
00:06:18,133 --> 00:06:19,200
I knew someone was going to

112
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,935
hurt him, so of course
I'd try to help him.

113
00:06:21,903 --> 00:06:24,472
I was able to find that his attacker
was related to Fan Family.

114
00:06:24,472 --> 00:06:26,241
It's Fan Jiahong, Rui's third uncle.

115
00:06:26,241 --> 00:06:27,642
You're trying to
make amends for my fault?

116
00:06:30,845 --> 00:06:31,946
I'd had enough of it.

117
00:06:31,946 --> 00:06:33,048
Bai Zongyi is my friend.

118
00:06:33,048 --> 00:06:33,815
You are being stubborn.

119
00:06:35,417 --> 00:06:38,219
Besides, it's been four years since
the Zhang Teng incident was resolved.

120
00:06:38,687 --> 00:06:39,721
There's no point

121
00:06:39,721 --> 00:06:40,689
in bringing it up again now.

122
00:06:40,689 --> 00:06:41,756
It hasn't been resolved.

123
00:06:44,426 --> 00:06:45,460
What do you mean?

124
00:06:47,128 --> 00:06:48,697
There are still some issues.

125
00:06:50,465 --> 00:06:52,634
People associated with Zhang Teng

126
00:06:53,668 --> 00:06:55,403
have been disrupting my business lately.

127
00:06:59,474 --> 00:07:00,675
Can you help me?

128
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:09,951
Okay, I will help you.

129
00:07:10,151 --> 00:07:11,152
Can you leave then?

130
00:07:12,187 --> 00:07:13,688
I'll have someone
contact you if necessary.

131
00:07:14,956 --> 00:07:16,324
I want you to contact me personally.

132
00:07:17,158 --> 00:07:18,193
I'll just see you.

133
00:07:18,793 --> 00:07:20,161
I'll just answer your call.

134
00:07:20,161 --> 00:07:21,162
I'll only trust you.

135
00:07:24,499 --> 00:07:26,101
Okay.

136
00:07:26,101 --> 00:07:27,402
Got it. You can let go of me now.

137
00:07:29,104 --> 00:07:30,972
You should have hired
more henchmen so that

138
00:07:31,606 --> 00:07:33,541
there are people to take
the hit when shots are fired.

139
00:07:47,922 --> 00:07:48,923
Boss.

140
00:07:50,024 --> 00:07:52,394
Why are all the cakes
strawberry-flavored today?

141
00:07:52,694 --> 00:07:54,028
Today is strawberry day.

142
00:07:55,263 --> 00:07:56,965
Then give me a strawberry mille-feuille.

143
00:07:56,965 --> 00:07:57,499
Okay.

144
00:07:59,601 --> 00:08:01,202
Why is there a strawberry day?

145
00:08:01,202 --> 00:08:02,704
Is there a story behind it?

146
00:08:02,704 --> 00:08:03,671
Well.

147
00:08:04,205 --> 00:08:05,974
You're not doing this for…

148
00:08:07,509 --> 00:08:08,176
No.

149
00:08:08,176 --> 00:08:09,377
Oh no.

150
00:08:09,377 --> 00:08:11,079
I don't have a chance anymore, do I?

151
00:08:12,013 --> 00:08:12,614
Here you go.

152
00:08:12,881 --> 00:08:15,216
- Enjoy.
- Your partner is lucky.

153
00:08:19,187 --> 00:08:20,588
Here you are.

154
00:08:20,588 --> 00:08:22,357
Yeah.

155
00:08:24,392 --> 00:08:25,894
They are all strawberry-flavored?

156
00:08:26,394 --> 00:08:27,562
It's because of Rui, isn't it?

157
00:08:34,836 --> 00:08:35,603
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

158
00:08:38,106 --> 00:08:39,441
How do you feel about switching from

159
00:08:39,441 --> 00:08:40,375
being a doctor to a baker?

160
00:08:41,242 --> 00:08:42,343
What about you?

161
00:08:42,343 --> 00:08:43,978
After being carried away by Chen Yi...

162
00:08:45,346 --> 00:08:47,382
I came to Taichung specifically
to see you this time.

163
00:08:47,382 --> 00:08:48,817
Don't mention him.

164
00:08:56,124 --> 00:08:57,091
He said that Zhang Teng's men

165
00:08:57,091 --> 00:08:59,060
are still bitter about
the incident from four years ago.

166
00:09:00,295 --> 00:09:02,397
Sometimes they caused
trouble at his places.

167
00:09:04,199 --> 00:09:05,667
But don't worry.

168
00:09:05,667 --> 00:09:07,836
He has already sent someone
to protect your family.

169
00:09:07,836 --> 00:09:09,304
He won't make the same mistake again.

170
00:09:11,739 --> 00:09:13,107
It would be nice if I could forget.

171
00:09:14,209 --> 00:09:16,144
I'm still scared
when I think about it now.

172
00:09:17,278 --> 00:09:18,813
There's nothing you can do about it.

173
00:09:18,813 --> 00:09:21,049
Your injury can only affect
your current memory, so you can still

174
00:09:21,049 --> 00:09:22,684
remember every detail
from four years ago.

175
00:09:37,432 --> 00:09:39,167
Is that why you can't forget Rui?

176
00:09:40,902 --> 00:09:42,470
I don't want to forget Zherui.

177
00:09:44,239 --> 00:09:45,840
Why can you be so optimistic?

178
00:09:47,442 --> 00:09:49,010
I have to give myself hope.

179
00:09:49,677 --> 00:09:50,979
I have faith that

180
00:09:50,979 --> 00:09:52,113
he will remember me one day.

181
00:09:53,848 --> 00:09:54,949
He'll open this door

182
00:09:54,949 --> 00:09:56,050
and say,

183
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:57,252
"I'm back."

184
00:10:04,359 --> 00:10:05,860
That's 735 in total.

185
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:08,062
Please come again if it's delicious.

186
00:10:15,637 --> 00:10:16,738
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry.

187
00:10:35,023 --> 00:10:36,024
Do you know him?

188
00:10:37,292 --> 00:10:38,293
No.

189
00:10:41,396 --> 00:10:42,830
Do we know each other?

190
00:10:44,299 --> 00:10:45,466
I mistook you for someone else.

191
00:10:47,268 --> 00:10:49,837
I mistook you for a friend. Sorry.

192
00:10:53,174 --> 00:10:55,109
We will be visiting Xuan'en Tech.

193
00:10:55,109 --> 00:10:56,945
Here is some background about them.

194
00:11:06,754 --> 00:11:07,922
Can we take the elevator first?

195
00:11:09,023 --> 00:11:10,325
Yeah. Sure.

196
00:11:41,389 --> 00:11:43,091
(In 2023,)

197
00:11:43,725 --> 00:11:45,293
(I ran across Zherui)

198
00:11:45,293 --> 00:11:46,127
(at Jiahong Trading.)

199
00:11:48,162 --> 00:11:49,163
(He's doing very well.)

200
00:11:51,165 --> 00:11:52,600
(His friend)

201
00:11:53,501 --> 00:11:54,702
(is also very kind to him.)

202
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:57,038
(He)

203
00:11:59,507 --> 00:12:00,441
(doesn't remember me.)

204
00:12:23,054 --> 00:12:29,337
(Zherui's album)

205
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,682
Zongyi, let's have late-night snack.

206
00:12:41,249 --> 00:12:42,016
Coming.

207
00:12:53,227 --> 00:12:54,162
You won't eat any?

208
00:12:54,495 --> 00:12:56,798
The stir-fried cabbage Dad made
is very crispy and delicious.

209
00:12:56,798 --> 00:12:58,466
Come on, eat a little bit with us.

210
00:12:59,133 --> 00:13:00,935
You guys are so mean.

211
00:13:00,935 --> 00:13:03,004
Eating this late can easily
lead to weight gain.

212
00:13:03,337 --> 00:13:04,706
We just got off work.

213
00:13:04,706 --> 00:13:05,673
Eat a little bit with us.

214
00:13:05,973 --> 00:13:06,541
Come on.

215
00:13:07,141 --> 00:13:08,509
Only half a bowl.

216
00:13:09,143 --> 00:13:10,044
Just half a bowl.

217
00:13:10,678 --> 00:13:11,713
Okay, that's enough.

218
00:13:12,413 --> 00:13:13,047
Enough.

219
00:13:13,948 --> 00:13:15,049
Okay, half a bowl.

220
00:13:16,284 --> 00:13:17,785
Dad, look at him.

221
00:13:17,785 --> 00:13:19,320
Eating vegetables won't make you fat.

222
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,388
I worry that you will go hungry.

223
00:13:20,388 --> 00:13:22,123
Weight gain reduces fall pain.

224
00:13:22,123 --> 00:13:23,391
So annoying.

225
00:13:23,391 --> 00:13:24,792
Then I'll eat this braised pork.

226
00:13:25,626 --> 00:13:26,694
Aren't you not eating?

227
00:13:26,694 --> 00:13:28,296
You asked me to eat.

228
00:13:28,796 --> 00:13:29,964
Wasn't weight gain your concern?

229
00:13:31,699 --> 00:13:34,736
Did you know that chubby girls
are currently trending?

230
00:13:34,736 --> 00:13:36,170
Great, then eat more.

231
00:13:46,748 --> 00:13:47,415
Chen Yi is not here?

232
00:13:49,484 --> 00:13:50,752
Mr. Yi said he'll return shortly.

233
00:13:50,752 --> 00:13:51,919
Please wait for him.

234
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:54,122
Alright.

235
00:13:54,122 --> 00:13:54,989
Go ahead with your work.

236
00:13:55,957 --> 00:13:56,891
Yes.

237
00:14:02,163 --> 00:14:03,331
How have you

238
00:14:03,331 --> 00:14:04,365
all been doing lately?

239
00:14:05,366 --> 00:14:07,068
We're doing fine.

240
00:14:07,068 --> 00:14:08,202
Very fine.

241
00:14:10,438 --> 00:14:11,239
Leave.

242
00:14:11,239 --> 00:14:12,406
Thanks, Ai Di.

243
00:14:19,247 --> 00:14:20,448
There's definitely something wrong.

244
00:14:31,926 --> 00:14:34,195
When did he start littering
the house with items?

245
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:36,964
He got bad.

246
00:15:10,431 --> 00:15:11,265
Chen Yi.

247
00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:16,704
I smell blood.

248
00:15:22,643 --> 00:15:23,511
What's wrong with you?

249
00:15:26,214 --> 00:15:27,215
Just a minor injury.

250
00:15:27,782 --> 00:15:28,716
It will heal in a few days.

251
00:15:31,686 --> 00:15:33,054
Anyway, I come to tell you

252
00:15:33,788 --> 00:15:35,122
the Dragon Gang has entirely wiped out

253
00:15:35,122 --> 00:15:36,290
Zhang Teng's underlings.

254
00:15:36,924 --> 00:15:38,259
If it is genuinely about Zhang Teng,

255
00:15:38,259 --> 00:15:39,427
it should be his relatives.

256
00:15:42,129 --> 00:15:43,397
I plan to look into that further.

257
00:15:43,397 --> 00:15:43,998
What do you think?

258
00:15:45,867 --> 00:15:46,868
Speak up.

259
00:15:48,102 --> 00:15:49,070
You wouldn't act like this

260
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:50,304
when I got close to you in the past.

261
00:15:51,205 --> 00:15:51,806
Why?

262
00:15:53,774 --> 00:15:55,009
It's none of your business.

263
00:15:58,045 --> 00:15:59,113
Do not leave without explaining.

264
00:16:04,185 --> 00:16:06,988
Multiple attempts have been made
by Fan family to harm Bai Zongyi.

265
00:16:07,622 --> 00:16:09,390
We will be killed
if we let our guard down.

266
00:16:11,392 --> 00:16:12,627
Come find me when you're serious

267
00:16:12,627 --> 00:16:13,661
about discussing Zhang Teng.

268
00:16:25,806 --> 00:16:26,874
What is it?

269
00:16:29,043 --> 00:16:31,045
You don't want to let me go?
You want to play with me?

270
00:16:34,782 --> 00:16:35,950
What?

271
00:16:38,619 --> 00:16:39,854
What if I said yes?

272
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:06,847
Chen Yi, what's wrong with you?

273
00:17:06,847 --> 00:17:07,982
Isn't it just for fun?

274
00:17:10,418 --> 00:17:11,519
Why are you suddenly afraid?

275
00:17:19,894 --> 00:17:21,195
I'm not interested right now.

276
00:17:22,063 --> 00:17:22,863
But I am.

277
00:17:27,935 --> 00:17:29,570
Can you face your favorite boss
if you do this?

278
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:31,005
He is always the boss.

279
00:17:31,005 --> 00:17:32,373
The man who raised us.

280
00:17:33,774 --> 00:17:34,342
You're insane!

281
00:17:37,945 --> 00:17:38,980
Chen Yi.

282
00:17:44,618 --> 00:17:45,786
I don't know you well enough,

283
00:17:47,488 --> 00:17:48,723
but I do know

284
00:17:49,357 --> 00:17:52,059
that when you lie,
you pick at your pinky.

285
00:18:02,903 --> 00:18:03,904
I'll make it

286
00:18:04,405 --> 00:18:05,606
happen next time.

287
00:18:08,776 --> 00:18:09,777
You're crazy.

288
00:18:11,412 --> 00:18:12,713
I just figured it out, Ai Di.

289
00:18:13,414 --> 00:18:14,548
I'm serious.

290
00:18:16,183 --> 00:18:17,518
Get your wound treated.

291
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:27,495
Zongyi, let's play a game.

292
00:18:27,495 --> 00:18:29,163
The loser does the dishes.

293
00:18:29,163 --> 00:18:31,232
Sure, I'm all for it.

294
00:18:31,232 --> 00:18:33,167
Rock, paper, scissors.

295
00:18:33,768 --> 00:18:34,935
I won.

296
00:18:34,935 --> 00:18:36,771
You wash the dishes.

297
00:18:37,271 --> 00:18:39,607
It's a miracle
when the person you like also likes you.

298
00:18:40,808 --> 00:18:42,543
A miracle doesn't happen
just by hoping for it.

299
00:18:42,543 --> 00:18:44,111
You need to get off the car.

300
00:18:44,111 --> 00:18:45,212
And press the doorbell.

301
00:18:46,247 --> 00:18:47,915
Non-talkers shouldn't
start talking a lot.

302
00:18:50,017 --> 00:18:51,185
32 seconds.

303
00:18:52,219 --> 00:18:53,788
You could only hold so long
when you met him.

304
00:18:53,788 --> 00:18:54,922
What on earth do you want to do?

305
00:18:55,623 --> 00:18:56,791
Don't you want to know

306
00:18:56,791 --> 00:18:58,259
how Bai Zongyi currently
feels about you?

307
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:00,728
He seems fond of you.

308
00:19:01,695 --> 00:19:02,963
But your attitude...

309
00:19:02,963 --> 00:19:04,165
It's none of your business.

310
00:19:06,967 --> 00:19:08,235
Bai Zongyi doesn't blame you.

311
00:19:09,103 --> 00:19:10,638
The shop he has opened is proof of this.

312
00:19:10,638 --> 00:19:11,839
He's waiting for you.

313
00:19:14,608 --> 00:19:16,777
He would have been a great doctor.

314
00:19:17,878 --> 00:19:19,113
I ruined him.

315
00:19:23,851 --> 00:19:25,386
Deciding to fall in love with someone

316
00:19:25,386 --> 00:19:27,621
is akin to entrusting
your life to that person.

317
00:19:28,355 --> 00:19:29,757
Unless he doesn't love you,

318
00:19:29,757 --> 00:19:31,792
he will be yours for life.

319
00:19:33,794 --> 00:19:35,463
You only have one reason not to see him.

320
00:19:37,631 --> 00:19:38,699
You're scared.

321
00:19:51,378 --> 00:19:52,446
You won't see him?

322
00:19:54,148 --> 00:19:55,616
It's not time to see him yet.

323
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:00,554
You really don't mind

324
00:20:00,855 --> 00:20:02,022
if I exact my revenge on them?

325
00:20:03,257 --> 00:20:04,959
The only condition for your cooperation

326
00:20:04,959 --> 00:20:06,627
is that you are allowed to seek justice.

327
00:20:08,129 --> 00:20:09,330
I always keep my word.

328
00:20:10,197 --> 00:20:11,966
Even if it means sending them to jail?

329
00:20:13,734 --> 00:20:16,036
The Fan Family can handle
this humiliation.

330
00:20:37,925 --> 00:20:38,893
Welcome.

331
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:48,335
Tell me what Chen Yi means.

332
00:20:49,637 --> 00:20:50,171
I have no idea

333
00:20:50,171 --> 00:20:51,739
what happened between you and Chen Yi.

334
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,175
Haven't I told you before?

335
00:20:55,943 --> 00:20:57,278
Right. You're forgetful.

336
00:20:57,278 --> 00:20:57,861
(Invoice)

337
00:20:58,812 --> 00:21:00,681
It's transient memory loss.

338
00:21:01,215 --> 00:21:03,284
That means you have a bad memory,
and it makes no difference.

339
00:21:05,486 --> 00:21:07,121
I grew up with him.

340
00:21:07,121 --> 00:21:08,122
Why on earth

341
00:21:08,122 --> 00:21:09,089
would he fall

342
00:21:09,089 --> 00:21:10,191
for an old man?

343
00:21:11,125 --> 00:21:12,560
He still likes the old man?

344
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:15,129
What you just said makes
it sound like that's not the case.

345
00:21:15,129 --> 00:21:16,197
You know it yourself, right?

346
00:21:17,831 --> 00:21:19,166
How would I know?

347
00:21:19,767 --> 00:21:22,136
You specifically came to Taichung
to show off to me, didn't you?

348
00:21:22,136 --> 00:21:23,837
You want to hear me say
that Chen Yi likes you.

349
00:21:25,072 --> 00:21:26,874
No way. Who cares?

350
00:21:27,474 --> 00:21:30,144
Having a bad memory
doesn't mean I'm stupid.

351
00:21:31,245 --> 00:21:32,346
No, I mean...

352
00:21:32,346 --> 00:21:33,948
The cheese has been refrigerated.

353
00:21:36,383 --> 00:21:37,418
You are…

354
00:21:38,519 --> 00:21:40,521
She is my high school classmate
who sat next to me.

355
00:21:41,422 --> 00:21:43,157
The one who kept following you around?

356
00:21:44,258 --> 00:21:45,125
How did you become so old?

357
00:21:45,125 --> 00:21:46,660
How come you haven't grown taller?

358
00:21:47,494 --> 00:21:48,295
Fine, you win.

359
00:21:49,997 --> 00:21:51,098
She works in your shop?

360
00:21:51,999 --> 00:21:53,167
Handle the store while I deliver.

361
00:21:53,701 --> 00:21:54,668
Be careful.

362
00:21:55,970 --> 00:21:57,871
Bai Zongyi, I'm not done talking.

363
00:21:57,871 --> 00:21:59,139
Just let me show off, okay?

364
00:22:05,346 --> 00:22:06,247
Bai Zongyi!

365
00:22:10,451 --> 00:22:11,919
Say it.

366
00:22:12,386 --> 00:22:13,921
You really think he likes me?

367
00:22:14,321 --> 00:22:15,322
Right?

368
00:22:15,889 --> 00:22:17,858
He wouldn't have
dragged me into bed otherwise.

369
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:21,061
It's not appropriate
to talk about this in public.

370
00:22:21,462 --> 00:22:22,830
Tell me.

371
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:23,998
Just say it and I'll stop asking.

372
00:22:24,598 --> 00:22:26,066
Hurry up, or you'll forget later.

373
00:22:26,066 --> 00:22:27,001
I have to tell you again.

374
00:22:27,668 --> 00:22:28,402
Geez.

375
00:22:28,402 --> 00:22:30,371
Don't you know him better than I do?

376
00:22:31,739 --> 00:22:33,073
I'm just worried that I'm only seeing

377
00:22:33,073 --> 00:22:34,141
what I want to see.

378
00:22:35,409 --> 00:22:37,311
I wonder if you would have
the courage to seize a dream

379
00:22:37,311 --> 00:22:38,612
if it were suddenly presented to you.

380
00:22:46,654 --> 00:22:47,454
What?

381
00:22:48,355 --> 00:22:49,757
He doesn't remember us.

382
00:22:50,057 --> 00:22:51,625
Don't bother him.

383
00:22:51,625 --> 00:22:52,293
Oh, right.

384
00:22:52,793 --> 00:22:54,428
Mr. Hong's daughter is here,

385
00:22:54,428 --> 00:22:55,696
let's have dinner together.

386
00:23:06,407 --> 00:23:07,908
Let's go.

387
00:23:15,849 --> 00:23:17,084
You really don't do anything?

388
00:23:34,297 --> 00:23:37,148
(Promotional picture

389
00:23:37,237 --> 00:23:38,706
Are you sure
you don't want to go find him?

390
00:23:40,107 --> 00:23:41,975
We are leaving Taichung tomorrow.

391
00:23:44,545 --> 00:23:46,080
Can you really stand it?

392
00:24:13,807 --> 00:24:15,342
(Fan Zherui's memory loss is a lie.)

393
00:24:15,342 --> 00:24:16,910
(If you want to see him today, meet him)

394
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:19,279

I don't even know why

420
00:26:18,911 --> 00:26:20,379
I like him so much.

421
00:26:22,681 --> 00:26:24,316
I only like him.
