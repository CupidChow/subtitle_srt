=KISEKI: Dear To Me=
=The Last Chapter=

18
00:01:22,403 --> 00:01:23,737
You've really grown up.

19
00:01:25,106 --> 00:01:26,574
If it were before,

20
00:01:27,274 --> 00:01:28,876
you might have killed many people.

21
00:01:29,743 --> 00:01:31,011
Now you can bear it.

22
00:01:31,912 --> 00:01:33,414
You've really grown up.

23
00:01:33,414 --> 00:01:34,381
I'm really angry now.

24
00:01:35,449 --> 00:01:37,451
You'd better not say another word
to provoke me.

25
00:01:38,652 --> 00:01:40,287
Why did you send someone
to shoot Chen Yi?

26
00:01:42,022 --> 00:01:43,557
I wanted to let a silly kid

27
00:01:43,557 --> 00:01:44,992
understand the horror of loss.

28
00:01:48,262 --> 00:01:50,064
Don't waste time playing hard-to-get.

29
00:01:50,764 --> 00:01:52,566
You're not a quiet type either.

30
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,168
Hurry back.

31
00:01:55,369 --> 00:01:57,238
Do you think I won't beat you
because Chen Yi is okay?

32
00:01:58,139 --> 00:01:59,006
You will.

33
00:01:59,907 --> 00:02:00,808
So,

34
00:02:00,808 --> 00:02:01,976
I brought you a gift.

35
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:03,811
Your favorite

36
00:02:03,811 --> 00:02:04,745
spicy hotpot.

37
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,808
(Spicy tofu with duck blood)

38
00:02:17,648 --> 00:02:19,248
(Dong Yang)

39
00:02:21,028 --> 00:02:21,962
Why is your face on it?

40
00:02:22,296 --> 00:02:23,130
Is there a problem?

41
00:02:26,901 --> 00:02:27,902
Come back to help him.

42
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:30,337
Next time,

43
00:02:30,871 --> 00:02:32,773
it won't be just rubber bullet.

44
00:02:33,807 --> 00:02:35,142
You know those people.

45
00:02:35,743 --> 00:02:36,844
They won't be kind.

46
00:02:38,679 --> 00:02:41,215
That's because you insist on
handing over Yiyun Syndicate to Chen Yi,

47
00:02:42,516 --> 00:02:45,586
and those senior members
lead a rebellion against him

48
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,656
and mess with him all day.

49
00:02:50,291 --> 00:02:51,492
You are only in your 40s.

50
00:02:51,492 --> 00:02:52,826
Why did you retire so early?

51
00:02:55,696 --> 00:02:57,164
Because time is very cunning.

52
00:03:01,602 --> 00:03:02,770
It's really very cunning.

53
00:03:03,904 --> 00:03:06,807
When you think
you have enough time to waste,

54
00:03:06,807 --> 00:03:08,676
(it stabs you in the back,)

55
00:03:09,777 --> 00:03:11,545
(making you realize)

56
00:03:11,545 --> 00:03:13,214
(it's actually extremely short.)

57
00:03:33,467 --> 00:03:35,069
It took me a while

58
00:03:35,703 --> 00:03:36,704
to talk to Ai Di.

59
00:03:40,874 --> 00:03:42,276
Are you really

60
00:03:42,276 --> 00:03:43,510
willing to step down?

61
00:03:49,316 --> 00:03:50,451
30 years.

62
00:03:52,253 --> 00:03:53,887
It's been 30 years, Minglei.

63
00:03:57,324 --> 00:03:58,459
I have gained,

64
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,728
lost,

65
00:04:02,396 --> 00:04:03,497
and missed

66
00:04:04,832 --> 00:04:05,899
enough.

67
00:04:08,135 --> 00:04:09,837
I hope I can just

68
00:04:10,738 --> 00:04:12,006
spend the time on us.

69
00:04:19,246 --> 00:04:20,414
Where are we going next?

70
00:04:21,548 --> 00:04:22,349
You can decide.

71
00:04:23,284 --> 00:04:24,752
From this moment forward,

72
00:04:24,752 --> 00:04:25,953
I'll listen to you.

73
00:04:31,025 --> 00:04:31,925
You don't believe me?

74
00:04:32,826 --> 00:04:34,728
I told you I'd listen to you.

75
00:04:34,728 --> 00:04:36,363
We can do anything you want.

76
00:04:37,431 --> 00:04:38,532
Trust me.

77
00:04:42,002 --> 00:04:42,936
Anything?

78
00:04:44,872 --> 00:04:45,973
Right.

79
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:49,443
For me,

80
00:04:50,177 --> 00:04:51,378
once I set my mind,

81
00:04:52,913 --> 00:04:53,881
it won't change.

82
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:04,091
30 years ago,

83
00:05:04,091 --> 00:05:05,693
I took you away from our hometown

84
00:05:05,693 --> 00:05:07,294
to live in this city.

85
00:05:07,895 --> 00:05:08,829
I said

86
00:05:09,263 --> 00:05:10,464
we would leave together.

87
00:05:14,268 --> 00:05:15,436
Now 30 years have passed,

88
00:05:19,006 --> 00:05:20,274
and I'm still saying the same thing.

89
00:05:21,675 --> 00:05:22,609
We'll

90
00:05:23,577 --> 00:05:24,712
leave together.

91
00:05:44,064 --> 00:05:45,466
If you don't know where to go,

92
00:05:45,466 --> 00:05:46,734
it doesn't matter.

93
00:05:46,734 --> 00:05:47,701
We can go to Japan

94
00:05:48,569 --> 00:05:49,770
to find Xian and Shuo

95
00:05:50,471 --> 00:05:52,639
and see how their business is going.

96
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,182
They have left. Stop pretending.

97
00:06:05,185 --> 00:06:06,420
Why didn't you send them off?

98
00:06:07,688 --> 00:06:08,655
I was afraid you'd be jealous.

99
00:06:09,757 --> 00:06:10,924
I wouldn't.

100
00:06:11,358 --> 00:06:12,993
Am I such a petty person?

101
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:18,065
Alright, I am.

102
00:06:20,968 --> 00:06:22,069
I want you to understand

103
00:06:22,069 --> 00:06:24,438
that my feelings for you and him
are different.

104
00:06:25,773 --> 00:06:27,608
I was really dizzy at the beginning.

105
00:06:27,608 --> 00:06:29,042
- The impact of the bullet...
- I know.

106
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:31,412
So let's sort these out.

107
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:34,815
Tell me. Why did you
stand in front of me back then?

108
00:06:38,185 --> 00:06:39,787
Because you were always
standing in front of me.

109
00:06:40,387 --> 00:06:42,055
At first, I thought
you were just impulsive

110
00:06:42,623 --> 00:06:43,557
and rash,

111
00:06:44,024 --> 00:06:45,325
and I thought you were annoying.

112
00:06:46,894 --> 00:06:48,395
I never thought
you were trying to protect me.

113
00:06:51,365 --> 00:06:52,433
Who said so?

114
00:06:55,569 --> 00:06:56,937
You were, even if you are short.

115
00:06:58,705 --> 00:06:59,907
Do you have a problem with that?

116
00:06:59,907 --> 00:07:01,208
Can't I be short?

117
00:07:01,542 --> 00:07:02,643
I'm not like you, who can grow

118
00:07:02,643 --> 00:07:04,077
to 186cm
even if you always stay up late.

119
00:07:05,012 --> 00:07:06,880
Do you think you are superior
because you are taller?

120
00:07:09,316 --> 00:07:10,484
You're so cute.

121
00:07:20,661 --> 00:07:22,062
I haven't finished talking.

122
00:07:36,977 --> 00:07:37,644
(Ai Di,)

123
00:07:37,644 --> 00:07:39,646
(I've found the person
related to Zhang Teng.)

124
00:07:59,666 --> 00:08:01,335
You're busy in love
and still have time to call me?

125
00:08:01,335 --> 00:08:02,135
Listen.

126
00:08:02,135 --> 00:08:03,537
He Sining is Zhang Teng's sister.

127
00:08:04,938 --> 00:08:06,573
The dealer that was caught in school

128
00:08:06,573 --> 00:08:07,975
four years ago is a lower-level one.

129
00:08:08,308 --> 00:08:09,810
The one that had a connection
with Zhang Teng

130
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:11,578
and sold drugs at school is He Sining.

131
00:08:12,346 --> 00:08:13,046
Hey!

132
00:08:14,615 --> 00:08:15,415
Hey!

133
00:08:15,883 --> 00:08:16,450
Stop!

134
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:17,384
Don't run.

135
00:08:24,591 --> 00:08:25,959
- What should I do?
- Go that way.

136
00:08:30,831 --> 00:08:31,798
Miss,

137
00:08:31,798 --> 00:08:32,933
did you see someone run by?

138
00:08:35,869 --> 00:08:37,070
Got him.

139
00:08:49,416 --> 00:08:50,751
Are you sure?

140
00:09:14,441 --> 00:09:16,276
We found the person
who helped Chen Yi.

141
00:09:16,276 --> 00:09:17,244
It's Fan Zherui.

142
00:09:25,319 --> 00:09:26,386
Did something happen?

143
00:09:31,058 --> 00:09:32,926
You said there's a new teacher
at your school.

144
00:09:34,394 --> 00:09:35,696
Yes, he's very handsome.

145
00:09:35,696 --> 00:09:37,798
Many people
have taken photos of him secretly.

146
00:09:39,132 --> 00:09:40,300
Look.

147
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:49,009
He is now at the school.

148
00:09:50,577 --> 00:09:51,578
What do you mean?

149
00:09:57,918 --> 00:09:58,785
Sining,

150
00:09:59,419 --> 00:10:00,554
leave the school quickly.

151
00:10:01,021 --> 00:10:02,856
Leave there quickly.
Don't let them find you.

152
00:10:03,223 --> 00:10:04,391
What does it mean?

153
00:10:04,925 --> 00:10:05,826
Mr. Gao is a good person.

154
00:10:05,826 --> 00:10:07,361
He is Fan Zherui!

155
00:10:07,361 --> 00:10:08,729
He is from the Yiyun Syndicate.

156
00:10:09,029 --> 00:10:11,331
The person who helped Chen Yi
overthrow our place is him.

157
00:10:13,433 --> 00:10:13,834
Zhang Teng.

158
00:10:13,834 --> 00:10:14,635
Leave me alone!

159
00:10:16,737 --> 00:10:18,071
- Zhang Teng.
- Fan Zherui.

160
00:10:18,071 --> 00:10:19,206
Fan Zherui.

161
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,108
Calm down a bit.

162
00:10:21,441 --> 00:10:23,477
We can think of a good way
to end all this

163
00:10:24,211 --> 00:10:25,345
and then leave here.

164
00:10:26,179 --> 00:10:27,080
We will live together.

165
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,482
You promised me, didn't you?

166
00:10:29,716 --> 00:10:30,817
It's okay.

167
00:10:30,817 --> 00:10:32,352
We agreed.

168
00:10:32,786 --> 00:10:33,487
It's okay.

169
00:10:35,689 --> 00:10:36,556
We agreed.

170
00:10:36,556 --> 00:10:39,760
- It's okay.
- We agreed on it.

171
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:40,861
We agreed on it.

172
00:10:41,261 --> 00:10:42,596
We agreed on it.

173
00:10:42,596 --> 00:10:43,397
We agreed on it.

174
00:10:49,169 --> 00:10:50,470
You killed my brother,

175
00:10:51,204 --> 00:10:53,173
and let Bai Zongyi
take the blame for you.

176
00:10:54,241 --> 00:10:55,575
Chen Yi has never said that,

177
00:10:55,575 --> 00:10:56,410
but

178
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:58,478
I know he has always
felt guilty towards you

179
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:01,581
for making you take the blame for Rui.

180
00:11:06,219 --> 00:11:07,020
What's wrong?

181
00:11:07,621 --> 00:11:09,556
It slipped off my hand.

182
00:11:09,556 --> 00:11:10,824
I'm sorry.

183
00:11:12,059 --> 00:11:14,394
You dare not take the responsibility.

184
00:11:15,629 --> 00:11:17,164
Murderer!

185
00:11:20,434 --> 00:11:23,603
My brother and I agreed
that we were going to stay together

186
00:11:24,471 --> 00:11:25,939
and start a new life together.

187
00:11:28,141 --> 00:11:31,111
We could have been happy.

188
00:11:32,145 --> 00:11:34,448
It was ruined all because of you.

189
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:51,064
Go quickly

190
00:11:52,199 --> 00:11:54,234
before anyone finds out.

191
00:11:54,234 --> 00:11:55,602
Go.

192
00:11:58,905 --> 00:11:59,906
Why?

193
00:12:02,409 --> 00:12:05,078
Live a good life in place of Zhang Teng.

194
00:12:05,912 --> 00:12:07,047
Go.

195
00:12:11,618 --> 00:12:13,687
Of course, I remember our agreement.

196
00:12:13,687 --> 00:12:15,722
After I get rid of Chen Yi and his gang,

197
00:12:15,722 --> 00:12:17,324
we will leave here.

198
00:12:19,159 --> 00:12:20,026
Okay.

199
00:12:21,561 --> 00:12:22,696
We'll start a new life together.

200
00:12:39,379 --> 00:12:40,413
Go.

201
00:12:43,984 --> 00:12:44,985
Go.

202
00:13:11,408 --> 00:13:14,672
(Bai Zongyi)

203
00:13:29,162 --> 00:13:30,030
Hello?

204
00:13:31,231 --> 00:13:32,032
Zherui, where are you?

205
00:13:32,032 --> 00:13:32,999
Why haven't you arrived yet?

206
00:13:34,734 --> 00:13:35,535
Hello?

207
00:13:36,069 --> 00:13:37,470
Zherui, say something.

208
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:38,972
Where are you now?

209
00:13:38,972 --> 00:13:41,341
Zherui?

210
00:13:57,290 --> 00:13:58,725
They're fine now.

211
00:13:58,725 --> 00:13:59,793
Don't worry.

212
00:14:01,161 --> 00:14:02,295
What do you mean by that?

213
00:14:04,865 --> 00:14:06,533
Can't you see the look
on Bai Zongyi's face?

214
00:14:08,335 --> 00:14:10,570
It's been a few days
since Rui had that accident.

215
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:12,372
Bai Zongyi should feel lucky
that he's not dead.

216
00:14:12,873 --> 00:14:14,074
And now he's cold?

217
00:14:14,941 --> 00:14:16,009
Bai Zongyi.

218
00:14:18,545 --> 00:14:19,613
How is it?

219
00:14:21,948 --> 00:14:23,183
You are finally talking to me.

220
00:14:27,821 --> 00:14:29,022
I'm sorry.

221
00:14:33,026 --> 00:14:34,127
Back then,

222
00:14:34,928 --> 00:14:37,030
all I could think about
was giving back Zhang Teng's life.

223
00:14:37,831 --> 00:14:40,166
I didn't consider your feelings.
I'm sorry.

224
00:14:40,901 --> 00:14:43,270
The Fan Family
won't let this matter be exposed.

225
00:14:44,304 --> 00:14:45,839
I will always owe him.

226
00:14:57,183 --> 00:14:58,485
We both owe him.

227
00:15:00,553 --> 00:15:01,922
If she comes back to you again,

228
00:15:02,489 --> 00:15:03,690
promise me

229
00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:04,858
that we will face it together.

230
00:15:09,763 --> 00:15:11,331
Don't leave me alone again.

231
00:15:28,281 --> 00:15:29,416
Have you made up?

232
00:15:34,988 --> 00:15:36,656
I have already sent people
after He Sining.

233
00:15:36,656 --> 00:15:37,590
Call them back.

234
00:15:38,658 --> 00:15:39,392
Why?

235
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,761
She avenged her brother's death.

236
00:15:41,761 --> 00:15:43,229
She got to do that.

237
00:15:43,229 --> 00:15:44,931
Let's put an end to this matter.

238
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,268
What about you, Bai Zongyi?

239
00:15:48,268 --> 00:15:49,202
What do you say?

240
00:16:01,748 --> 00:16:02,716
Let it be.

241
00:16:06,786 --> 00:16:07,754
Let it be.

242
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:19,599
Promise me

243
00:16:19,966 --> 00:16:21,134
that you won't die before me.

244
00:16:22,102 --> 00:16:23,470
Just thinking about it is unbearable.

245
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:25,105
If you really die,

246
00:16:25,105 --> 00:16:25,905
I will go crazy,

247
00:16:25,905 --> 00:16:27,474
and then I will do crazy things.

248
00:16:27,907 --> 00:16:29,409
So for the sake of everyone,

249
00:16:29,409 --> 00:16:30,744
if someone has to die, I'll die first.

250
00:16:31,811 --> 00:16:33,113
So you think I won't go crazy?

251
00:16:33,947 --> 00:16:35,015
You're more normal than me.

252
00:16:35,015 --> 00:16:36,182
You'll survive.

253
00:16:37,484 --> 00:16:38,318
Let's make a deal.

254
00:16:39,052 --> 00:16:41,855
Even if you're about to die,
you have to wait for me to die first.

255
00:16:45,291 --> 00:16:46,226
Chen Yi.

256
00:16:47,394 --> 00:16:48,294
Deal?

257
00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:51,965
Answer me.

258
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:53,800
Hurry up.

259
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,335
Tell me whether we can...

260
00:17:19,092 --> 00:17:19,993
One second.

261
00:17:21,094 --> 00:17:21,961
What?

262
00:17:23,063 --> 00:17:24,130
I'll give you one second.

263
00:17:24,864 --> 00:17:26,232
Then I'll follow you right after.

264
00:17:30,403 --> 00:17:31,838
Are you saying

265
00:17:33,807 --> 00:17:35,875
that if I die, you can't live either?

266
00:17:35,875 --> 00:17:37,143
I'll live one second longer than you.

267
00:17:47,253 --> 00:17:48,254
The seat belt.

268
00:17:58,098 --> 00:17:59,365
So you like me that much?

269
00:18:01,434 --> 00:18:02,402
That's nice.

270
00:18:03,703 --> 00:18:04,671
You're really noisy.

271
00:18:34,934 --> 00:18:37,237
Actually, it would be better
if we could die together, wouldn't it?

272
00:18:38,505 --> 00:18:40,707
This way, none of us would have to
feel sad for the other, right?

273
00:18:42,509 --> 00:18:43,476
Shut up.

274
00:18:56,256 --> 00:18:57,157
We're back.

275
00:18:59,692 --> 00:19:00,393
Zherui.

276
00:19:00,393 --> 00:19:01,294
Jingyu.

277
00:19:01,294 --> 00:19:02,462
Take it easy.

278
00:19:02,996 --> 00:19:03,897
Here.

279
00:19:04,264 --> 00:19:06,399
Did you take good care of Zherui?

280
00:19:06,399 --> 00:19:07,300
You're annoying.

281
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:08,701
Zherui, you are here.

282
00:19:08,701 --> 00:19:09,969
Sorry for disturbing you, Mr. Bai.

283
00:19:09,969 --> 00:19:11,171
Not at all.

284
00:19:11,171 --> 00:19:12,071
Fish soup is almost ready.

285
00:19:12,071 --> 00:19:13,540
Remember to drink some later.

286
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:14,541
Thank you, Father.

287
00:19:14,541 --> 00:19:15,275
No need to thank me.

288
00:19:15,275 --> 00:19:16,176
It is for Zherui.

289
00:19:18,411 --> 00:19:19,812
Do you realize your place in the family?

290
00:19:20,947 --> 00:19:21,347
Come on.

291
00:19:21,347 --> 00:19:22,148
Come in.

292
00:19:22,148 --> 00:19:23,116
Be careful.

293
00:19:24,083 --> 00:19:24,584
Zherui,

294
00:19:24,584 --> 00:19:26,119
I've prepared your room for you.

295
00:19:26,119 --> 00:19:27,420
And I've even changed the sheets.

296
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:28,354
You are so nice.

297
00:19:29,455 --> 00:19:31,224
The guest room is over there, Zongyi.

298
00:19:31,224 --> 00:19:32,125
He'll stay in my room.

299
00:19:32,125 --> 00:19:33,059
So I can take care of him.

300
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:34,994
Really?

301
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:38,665
Is it really for taking care of him?

302
00:19:39,232 --> 00:19:41,167
We don't need you here, so please leave.

303
00:19:41,701 --> 00:19:42,435
Hey, wait...

304
00:19:43,536 --> 00:19:44,404
Just ignore her.

305
00:19:51,044 --> 00:19:52,412
Bai Jingyu.

306
00:19:53,913 --> 00:19:54,480
Father.

307
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,015
Be careful. The fish soup is hot.

308
00:19:56,316 --> 00:19:56,883
Here you go.

309
00:19:57,850 --> 00:19:58,418
It's hot.

310
00:19:58,952 --> 00:19:59,986
Thanks, Mr. Bai.

311
00:19:59,986 --> 00:20:01,921
Just make yourself at home.

312
00:20:01,921 --> 00:20:03,590
Fish soup is good for recovery.

313
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:05,992
My father's fish soup is delicious.

314
00:20:05,992 --> 00:20:07,293
The fish bones are almost gone.

315
00:20:07,293 --> 00:20:08,595
Zherui, drink it.

316
00:20:08,995 --> 00:20:09,729
Drink it slowly.

317
00:20:09,729 --> 00:20:10,630
Be careful of small bones.

318
00:20:14,901 --> 00:20:15,868
It's so tasty.

319
00:20:33,219 --> 00:20:34,487
Thank you all.

320
00:20:36,656 --> 00:20:38,992
Zherui, please don't cry anymore.

321
00:20:39,926 --> 00:20:42,562
You're making me want to cry.

322
00:20:45,665 --> 00:20:47,333
Don't cry.

323
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:49,636
The one crying is the piglet.

324
00:21:00,546 --> 00:21:01,447
What's this?

325
00:21:01,948 --> 00:21:02,782
It's for you.

326
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:06,119
(AI DI 2001.2.5)

327
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:09,055
Can't you wait to give it to me
on my birthday?

328
00:21:09,756 --> 00:21:10,790
Birthday?

329
00:21:12,091 --> 00:21:13,092
That's half a year away.

330
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:14,794
That will be too long.

331
00:21:15,528 --> 00:21:17,297
Too long?

332
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:19,365
Don't you remember
how long I've waited for you?

333
00:21:19,365 --> 00:21:20,566
It will be only half a year.

334
00:21:21,501 --> 00:21:22,468
And you think it's long.

335
00:21:23,803 --> 00:21:24,570
You don't want it?

336
00:21:24,570 --> 00:21:25,571
Then I'll take it back.

337
00:21:25,571 --> 00:21:26,506
Hey.

338
00:21:26,506 --> 00:21:27,774
Alright.

339
00:21:29,309 --> 00:21:31,844
Are you in such a hurry
to stake your claim?

340
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:34,947
Chen Yi?

341
00:21:37,717 --> 00:21:39,085
