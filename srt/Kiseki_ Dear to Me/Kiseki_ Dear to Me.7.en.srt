=Episode 7=

18
00:02:07,005 --> 00:02:08,573
You shouldn't have come here.

19
00:02:09,374 --> 00:02:10,909
You shouldn't have helped me.

20
00:02:11,176 --> 00:02:12,244
You should just let me be.

21
00:02:13,578 --> 00:02:15,180
Because now, my feelings for you
run even deeper.

22
00:02:25,957 --> 00:02:27,492
I really like you.

23
00:04:19,304 --> 00:04:20,472
Wait.

24
00:04:20,939 --> 00:04:22,040
You sure you know how this works?

25
00:04:22,941 --> 00:04:24,009
Yes.

26
00:04:24,009 --> 00:04:25,777
I checked online

27
00:04:25,777 --> 00:04:27,245
after I fell in love with you.

28
00:04:27,679 --> 00:04:28,914
Kiddo.

29
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:04,909
I love you.

30
00:06:34,572 --> 00:06:35,373
How do you feel?

31
00:06:37,609 --> 00:06:39,144
I didn't mean to hurt you.

32
00:06:39,144 --> 00:06:40,278
It was my first time.

33
00:06:40,278 --> 00:06:41,313
Sorry.

34
00:06:44,282 --> 00:06:45,350
Do better next time.

35
00:06:53,992 --> 00:06:55,460
I love you.

36
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:56,361
What about you?

37
00:06:56,361 --> 00:06:57,262
Do you love me?

38
00:06:58,463 --> 00:06:59,998
Would I be here if I didn't?

39
00:07:03,168 --> 00:07:05,003
I did something hurtful to you
several days ago.

40
00:07:05,003 --> 00:07:06,071
Sorry.

41
00:07:06,371 --> 00:07:07,505
I needed time to sort things out.

42
00:07:09,374 --> 00:07:10,375
It's okay.

43
00:07:10,675 --> 00:07:12,077
Thank you for loving me.

44
00:07:29,194 --> 00:07:30,261
What is this?

45
00:07:30,261 --> 00:07:31,329
Anti-inflammatory cream.

46
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:33,098
They say it'll help.

47
00:07:33,098 --> 00:07:34,566
Who?

48
00:07:34,566 --> 00:07:35,667
People online.

49
00:07:36,434 --> 00:07:38,336
- What are you doing?
- Applying ointment on you.

50
00:07:38,336 --> 00:07:39,337
I don't need it.

51
00:08:09,038 --> 00:08:12,061
(Jingyu)

52
00:08:14,439 --> 00:08:15,407
Zongyi, open the door.

53
00:08:15,407 --> 00:08:16,975
Dad and I are here.

54
00:08:19,177 --> 00:08:21,079
Hello?

55
00:08:21,079 --> 00:08:22,213
Are you there?

56
00:08:22,213 --> 00:08:23,348
Are you alive?

57
00:08:23,348 --> 00:08:24,449
Hello?

58
00:08:24,449 --> 00:08:25,817
Hey?

59
00:08:25,817 --> 00:08:26,851
Hello?

60
00:08:32,056 --> 00:08:33,691
My clothes!

61
00:08:40,398 --> 00:08:41,399
Here, please.

62
00:08:45,003 --> 00:08:46,237
I wouldn't want to bother you.

63
00:08:46,237 --> 00:08:47,572
It's okay.

64
00:08:47,572 --> 00:08:48,039
Bai Jingyu.

65
00:08:48,039 --> 00:08:49,774
Dad, look. It's so beautiful!

66
00:08:49,774 --> 00:08:50,708
Bai Jingyu.

67
00:08:50,708 --> 00:08:52,577
- Bai...
- This is so beautiful!

68
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,314
You know what?

69
00:08:56,314 --> 00:08:58,450
I should ask Zongyi
to get me another place.

70
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:00,185
It's okay, Mr. Bai.

71
00:09:00,185 --> 00:09:02,153
You can't stay at Zongyi's
because of a water leak.

72
00:09:02,153 --> 00:09:03,755
And I'm glad to help.

73
00:09:04,122 --> 00:09:05,423
Come. Let me get you some slippers.

74
00:09:07,258 --> 00:09:08,626
Make yourself at home.

75
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:09,694
Take a seat.

76
00:09:10,061 --> 00:09:10,795
Thanks.

77
00:09:15,567 --> 00:09:17,101
Come. Sit down.

78
00:09:17,735 --> 00:09:19,404
I'll cut up some fruit. Rest a bit.

79
00:09:20,071 --> 00:09:20,872
Thanks.

80
00:09:42,527 --> 00:09:43,361
Zongyi.

81
00:09:44,262 --> 00:09:45,263
How did you

82
00:09:45,263 --> 00:09:46,231
meet him?

83
00:09:49,033 --> 00:09:50,435
I met him during work.

84
00:09:51,603 --> 00:09:52,170
I see.

85
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:53,238
Have some fruit.

86
00:09:54,706 --> 00:09:57,075
Yay! Fruit!

87
00:09:59,644 --> 00:10:01,446
Jingyu can take the guest room.

88
00:10:01,446 --> 00:10:03,348
Mr. Bai, Zongyi and you
can take my room.

89
00:10:03,348 --> 00:10:04,549
What about you then?

90
00:10:04,716 --> 00:10:06,351
There's a sofa bed in my study.

91
00:10:06,851 --> 00:10:07,752
Zherui.

92
00:10:08,453 --> 00:10:09,320
What are you doing?

93
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,889
Move aside a bit.

94
00:10:12,056 --> 00:10:13,458
Are you in a relationship?

95
00:10:13,558 --> 00:10:14,592
I'm 16. Will you date me?

96
00:10:14,592 --> 00:10:15,226
What is this?

97
00:10:15,226 --> 00:10:16,561
- Jingyu.
- What?

98
00:10:16,561 --> 00:10:19,430
Last week, you said you had a crush
on your senior of the badminton team.

99
00:10:20,331 --> 00:10:22,267
Dad. Have you tried picking shells
by the beach before?

100
00:10:22,267 --> 00:10:23,134
Huh?

101
00:10:23,434 --> 00:10:24,369
A relationship

102
00:10:24,369 --> 00:10:26,137
is like picking shells.

103
00:10:26,137 --> 00:10:27,171
You grab one,

104
00:10:27,171 --> 00:10:28,873
and you look for the next.

105
00:10:28,873 --> 00:10:30,808
When you find a better shell,
you discard the old one.

106
00:10:30,808 --> 00:10:31,876
Hermit crabs do the same thing.

107
00:10:31,876 --> 00:10:33,511
They go from one big shell
to another bigger shell.

108
00:10:33,511 --> 00:10:35,213
The same goes for love.

109
00:10:35,213 --> 00:10:36,014
Understand?

110
00:10:36,748 --> 00:10:37,615
Greedy girl.

111
00:10:39,817 --> 00:10:40,818
You won't get it.

112
00:10:41,486 --> 00:10:42,287
Zherui.

113
00:10:42,487 --> 00:10:43,254
Will you date me?

114
00:10:43,254 --> 00:10:44,689
Stop it, Bai Jingyu.

115
00:10:44,689 --> 00:10:46,457
- What?
- Zherui

116
00:10:46,457 --> 00:10:47,392
is taken.

117
00:10:47,392 --> 00:10:48,726
Stop pestering him.

118
00:10:50,528 --> 00:10:51,896
OK, fine.

119
00:10:51,896 --> 00:10:53,331
Go back to your seat.

120
00:10:53,331 --> 00:10:54,198
It's fine.

121
00:10:54,198 --> 00:10:55,700
Put me on the waiting list.

122
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:56,968
Once Zherui is available,

123
00:10:56,968 --> 00:10:57,969
it'll be my turn.

124
00:10:57,969 --> 00:10:59,470
Eat your fruit.

125
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:03,107
Mr. Fan, I'm sorry.

126
00:11:03,107 --> 00:11:04,309
My daughter loves to joke around.

127
00:11:04,309 --> 00:11:05,577
It's okay.

128
00:11:06,177 --> 00:11:06,978
Jingyu.

129
00:11:07,545 --> 00:11:09,347
I love my partner a lot,

130
00:11:09,347 --> 00:11:10,948
so you'll be on the waiting list
for a long while.

131
00:11:26,297 --> 00:11:27,165
- Mr. Bai.
- Yeah?

132
00:11:27,165 --> 00:11:27,899
Have some fruit.

133
00:11:27,899 --> 00:11:29,000
- Okay.
- Have some, Dad.

134
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,101
- Thanks.
- It's sweet.

135
00:11:30,101 --> 00:11:31,102
It is delicious.

136
00:11:31,102 --> 00:11:32,203
I feel bad.

137
00:11:32,203 --> 00:11:33,271
I'm serious. Just eat.

138
00:11:33,271 --> 00:11:34,038
Okay, I will.

139
00:12:07,905 --> 00:12:09,140
If you don't sleep now,

140
00:12:09,574 --> 00:12:10,408
you'll be too tired

141
00:12:10,408 --> 00:12:11,609
to entertain your family tomorrow.

142
00:12:13,277 --> 00:12:14,545
Worried about your place?

143
00:12:15,179 --> 00:12:16,114
No.

144
00:12:18,016 --> 00:12:19,384
Do you want to move in with me?

145
00:12:19,851 --> 00:12:21,152
It's closer to your school.

146
00:12:21,152 --> 00:12:22,086
Perfect for your commute.

147
00:12:22,086 --> 00:12:23,154
You can save money, too.

148
00:12:24,522 --> 00:12:26,557
It's okay. I quite like my place.

149
00:12:27,458 --> 00:12:29,494
Let me take care of you, okay?

150
00:12:30,328 --> 00:12:31,229
Unless

151
00:12:31,562 --> 00:12:33,431
you think it's humiliating.

152
00:12:37,502 --> 00:12:38,469
No.

153
00:12:38,469 --> 00:12:39,337
Why would I think that way?

154
00:12:46,444 --> 00:12:47,945
Yes, I have money.

155
00:12:48,312 --> 00:12:50,648
But I want to use it
to take care of someone I like.

156
00:12:50,648 --> 00:12:52,450
To make him happy. Is it wrong?

157
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:57,255
But I feel like I'm not contributing.

158
00:12:57,822 --> 00:12:58,790
Like I don't deserve you.

159
00:13:06,631 --> 00:13:08,266
You are idolizing me.

160
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:09,567
What you have

161
00:13:09,567 --> 00:13:11,502
is something I can't buy with money.

162
00:13:12,603 --> 00:13:14,272
In a sense, I don't deserve you.

163
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,175
I don't get it.

164
00:13:21,045 --> 00:13:22,380
This is my story.

165
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:23,981
And I'll only say it once.

166
00:13:23,981 --> 00:13:25,182
You should forget it after this.

167
00:13:27,485 --> 00:13:29,387
A long time ago,
there was a very smart kid.

168
00:13:30,021 --> 00:13:31,889
He lived with his mother.

169
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:33,391
One day,

170
00:13:33,391 --> 00:13:35,493
a father who he thought
was long dead returned.

171
00:13:35,493 --> 00:13:37,395
The father said he wanted
to take him and his mother home.

172
00:13:37,729 --> 00:13:39,531
The smart kid then learned

173
00:13:39,531 --> 00:13:41,399
that he was actually the love child
of a rich businessman.

174
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,801
The kid had a little brother.

175
00:13:44,435 --> 00:13:46,070
And that little brother was expected

176
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:47,438
to be the heir.

177
00:13:47,739 --> 00:13:49,674
To appease the little brother,
the mother of the smart kid

178
00:13:49,674 --> 00:13:51,442
asked the smart kid to play dumb.

179
00:13:53,845 --> 00:13:55,413
To never steal
his little brother's limelight.

180
00:13:56,981 --> 00:13:59,317
She tore the smart kid's exam papers,
which had perfect scores.

181
00:14:00,284 --> 00:14:01,519
She stopped him from learning piano.

182
00:14:02,487 --> 00:14:04,088
She even went as far
as to slam the lid

183
00:14:05,089 --> 00:14:07,358
to damage her son's fingers.

184
00:14:09,594 --> 00:14:10,628
No one wanted the smart kid.

185
00:14:10,628 --> 00:14:12,630
No one expected the smart kid
to achieve anything.

186
00:14:14,532 --> 00:14:15,600
But you're different.

187
00:14:16,868 --> 00:14:17,969
You have a family.

188
00:14:17,969 --> 00:14:20,204
They love you.
They have expectations of you.

189
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:23,541
That's

190
00:14:24,142 --> 00:14:25,710
something the smart kid cannot have.

191
00:14:30,481 --> 00:14:31,616
Who told you that?

192
00:14:33,284 --> 00:14:34,886
They don't want you. I do.

193
00:14:35,486 --> 00:14:37,121
They don't support you. I will.

194
00:14:43,594 --> 00:14:44,862
You have me.

195
00:14:47,231 --> 00:14:48,099
Sorry.

196
00:14:48,866 --> 00:14:50,434
What a boring story, right?

197
00:14:51,369 --> 00:14:52,170
It's not boring.

198
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:53,604
It's important to me.

199
00:14:58,576 --> 00:15:00,411
My mom left me

200
00:15:01,746 --> 00:15:03,014
when I was little.

201
00:15:03,514 --> 00:15:04,482
She abandoned us.

202
00:15:07,785 --> 00:15:09,520
Dad and Jingyu were devastated.

203
00:15:10,555 --> 00:15:11,455
But

204
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:13,925
I was happy.

205
00:15:14,759 --> 00:15:16,561
Because I wouldn't be caned anymore.

206
00:15:19,197 --> 00:15:21,065
Whenever it rained,

207
00:15:21,065 --> 00:15:22,233
she would hit me.

208
00:15:23,701 --> 00:15:24,802
If there was thunder,

209
00:15:24,802 --> 00:15:26,204
she would hit me harder.

210
00:15:30,675 --> 00:15:32,043
I am scared of her.

211
00:15:38,416 --> 00:15:40,051
But you're a grown-up now.

212
00:15:40,551 --> 00:15:41,853
You don't have to fear her anymore.

213
00:16:08,212 --> 00:16:10,448
The school has been
cracking down on us lately.

214
00:16:12,316 --> 00:16:14,151
Ask our men

215
00:16:14,151 --> 00:16:15,219
to lay low for a while.

216
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,889
We can resume once it's over.

217
00:16:17,889 --> 00:16:18,890
You hear me?

218
00:16:22,827 --> 00:16:24,795
I did not forget about my promise.

219
00:16:24,795 --> 00:16:26,931
Once I get rid of Chen Yi and his gang,

220
00:16:26,931 --> 00:16:28,432
we will leave this place

221
00:16:29,467 --> 00:16:30,768
and start anew.

222
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:34,338
I found out
who has been helping Chen Yi.

223
00:16:34,605 --> 00:16:35,673
It's Fan Zherui.

224
00:16:53,124 --> 00:16:55,626
Don't fuss over accommodation.

225
00:16:55,626 --> 00:16:57,328
Let me pamper you for a few years.

226
00:16:58,029 --> 00:16:59,730
After you become a doctor,

227
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:00,665
I can rely on you.

228
00:17:00,998 --> 00:17:02,066
When that happens,

229
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,235
I'll be in charge of your meals

230
00:17:04,235 --> 00:17:05,236
and nothing else.

231
00:17:06,237 --> 00:17:07,104
Okay.

232
00:17:07,371 --> 00:17:08,639
I'll take care of you in the future.

233
00:17:08,639 --> 00:17:09,440
You cook

234
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,374
while I bake.

235
00:18:05,563 --> 00:18:06,430
What is this?

236
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:07,298
Are you sick?

237
00:18:10,835 --> 00:18:11,802
Zi'an gave it to me.

238
00:18:11,802 --> 00:18:13,637
He said it'd help me focus

239
00:18:13,637 --> 00:18:14,739
on my studies.

240
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:24,879
(Cayenne Auto Shop)

241
00:18:28,986 --> 00:18:30,021
- Boss.
- Boss.

242
00:18:32,823 --> 00:18:33,657
Is Ai Di back?

243
00:18:33,657 --> 00:18:35,493
No, I checked with the bar.

244
00:18:35,493 --> 00:18:36,827
They said he hadn't visited
for a few days.

245
00:18:41,132 --> 00:18:42,310
(Ai Di)

246
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,908
What is his deal?

247
00:18:51,842 --> 00:18:52,410
Jie.

248
00:18:53,577 --> 00:18:54,678
Search for him.

249
00:18:55,046 --> 00:18:55,880
All right.

250
00:18:56,514 --> 00:18:59,150
(What do I do?
Ai Di told me not to tell him.)

251
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,121
Who gave this to you?

252
00:19:04,955 --> 00:19:06,690
A friend.

253
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:07,625
Sir.

254
00:19:07,625 --> 00:19:09,060
Are you very close
to the transfer student?

255
00:19:09,994 --> 00:19:10,995
Don't change the topic.

256
00:19:11,695 --> 00:19:12,663
Who gave this to you?

257
00:19:12,663 --> 00:19:13,531
Zi'an.

258
00:19:13,531 --> 00:19:15,099
What your friend gave you is the drug.

259
00:19:15,099 --> 00:19:16,467
We have to catch him.

260
00:19:16,801 --> 00:19:18,502
You're cops?

261
00:19:18,936 --> 00:19:19,804
Undercover cops?

262
00:19:19,804 --> 00:19:20,771
In a school?

263
00:19:20,771 --> 00:19:21,739
Like Stephen Chow's movie?

264
00:19:25,443 --> 00:19:27,178
Interrogate me, Mr. Officer.

265
00:19:27,178 --> 00:19:28,145
I am innocent.

266
00:19:28,145 --> 00:19:29,080
You're a cop?

267
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,414
You're a cop?

268
00:19:30,948 --> 00:19:32,516
I'll do my part to fight criminals!

269
00:19:35,186 --> 00:19:36,220
(March 4th, Second Period.)

270
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:37,254
(Classroom 315, Seat 2 to 3.)

271
00:19:50,634 --> 00:19:51,802
Found you!

272
00:19:51,802 --> 00:19:53,938
Getting desperate now
because I pretended to sell it too?

273
00:19:53,938 --> 00:19:55,539
You'd even accept an order
from an unknown source.

274
00:20:03,814 --> 00:20:04,949
Ai Di!

275
00:20:13,724 --> 00:20:15,292
Hey! Stop right there!

276
00:20:15,426 --> 00:20:16,560
Stop!

277
00:20:16,894 --> 00:20:17,895
Ai Di!

278
00:20:18,295 --> 00:20:18,696
Stop him!

279
00:20:20,164 --> 00:20:21,866
Hey! Stop right there!

280
00:20:21,866 --> 00:20:22,766
Stop!

281
00:20:30,374 --> 00:20:31,408
Move aside!

282
00:20:31,909 --> 00:20:33,210
Are you okay?

283
00:20:33,544 --> 00:20:34,445
Miss,

284
00:20:34,445 --> 00:20:35,746
did you see a man running away?

285
00:20:37,548 --> 00:20:38,549
I caught him.

286
00:20:45,022 --> 00:20:45,623
Who is he?

287
00:20:45,623 --> 00:20:46,690
Why are you apprehending him?

288
00:20:47,124 --> 00:20:48,325
We caught you.

289
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:57,001
So you two disguised
as a teacher and a student

290
00:20:57,001 --> 00:20:58,435
to track down the dealer.

291
00:21:00,171 --> 00:21:01,605
Are you cops, then?

292
00:21:02,239 --> 00:21:03,641
No way. I'm...

293
00:21:08,045 --> 00:21:09,313
We caught the dealer.

294
00:21:09,313 --> 00:21:10,381
The school is safe.

295
00:21:11,849 --> 00:21:13,250
So you're leaving?

296
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:13,784
Yeah.

297
00:21:14,385 --> 00:21:15,352
Not me.

298
00:21:15,352 --> 00:21:16,954
I still remember my promise to you.

299
00:21:17,621 --> 00:21:19,156
Before I win you that 5,000,

300
00:21:19,156 --> 00:21:20,191
I won't leave.

301
00:21:20,491 --> 00:21:22,092
You dragged me into the contest.

302
00:21:22,426 --> 00:21:23,761
You did raise your hand.

303
00:21:23,761 --> 00:21:24,995
Just give it a try.

304
00:21:25,296 --> 00:21:26,163
No.

305
00:21:26,163 --> 00:21:27,131
But I want to see you in a costume.

306
00:21:27,998 --> 00:21:29,767
- No.
- It's 5,000.

307
00:21:30,401 --> 00:21:31,268
All right.

308
00:21:31,268 --> 00:21:33,771
I should leave you two alone.

309
00:21:34,238 --> 00:21:35,639
I have to head back and do my homework.

310
00:21:35,639 --> 00:21:37,508
- Bye.
- Bye.

311
00:21:38,209 --> 00:21:39,510
Do you know how to get down?

312
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:40,377
Yes.

313
00:21:43,781 --> 00:21:44,448
What?

314
00:21:44,448 --> 00:21:45,883
I shouldn't have stopped the dealer

315
00:21:45,883 --> 00:21:47,251
so that I could see you in the school.

316
00:21:47,651 --> 00:21:49,820
Drugs are dangerous.

317
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:51,422
And it's not like we can do anything

318
00:21:52,223 --> 00:21:53,057
at school.

319
00:21:53,157 --> 00:21:54,325
So I can do anything to you at home.

320
00:21:54,625 --> 00:21:55,726
Is that what you mean?

321
00:21:56,493 --> 00:21:57,595

It's almost time for Grade 12 students.

339
00:22:50,314 --> 00:22:51,348
Everyone is waiting for us.

340
00:22:54,818 --> 00:22:55,686
Sorry.

341
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:57,621
But who are you?

342
00:22:58,188 --> 00:22:59,657
Am I not cute?

343
00:23:04,962 --> 00:23:05,863
You're also quite cute.

344
00:23:08,065 --> 00:23:09,667
What a shame that Sining isn't here.

345
00:23:09,667 --> 00:23:12,069
She's been on sick leave
for more than a week already.

346
00:23:13,737 --> 00:23:15,639
You look good, Big Bad Wolf.

347
00:23:15,639 --> 00:23:16,940
Why are you here?

348
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:17,975
I'm here to take photos of you.

349
00:23:18,609 --> 00:23:19,910
Stop it.

350
00:23:20,377 --> 00:23:21,412
Stop.

351
00:23:21,645 --> 00:23:22,913
I want some photos, too.

352
00:23:23,213 --> 00:23:23,981
I look cute,

353
00:23:23,981 --> 00:23:25,683
so someone should take photos of me.

354
00:23:28,868 --> 00:23:30,897
(Jie)

355
00:23:33,924 --> 00:23:35,192
Hey. What's the matter?

356
00:23:35,793 --> 00:23:36,593
Mr. Yi is injured.

357
00:23:36,593 --> 00:23:37,961
Ai Di, come back now.

358
00:23:42,066 --> 00:23:43,834
- What's the matter with him?
- Edison, where are you going?

359
00:23:46,103 --> 00:23:47,404
Someone misses him.

360
00:23:47,404 --> 00:23:48,215
(Chen Yi: Is Ai Di with you?)

361
00:23:48,215 --> 00:23:48,981
(Yes, you want to see him?)

362
00:23:51,275 --> 00:23:52,343
The Red Riding Hood is gone.

363
00:23:52,343 --> 00:23:53,677
How are we going to perform now?

364
00:23:53,677 --> 00:23:54,611
Mr. Gao.

365
00:23:58,749 --> 00:23:59,650
Bai Zongyi.

366
00:23:59,650 --> 00:24:00,984
Where are you going?

367
00:24:00,984 --> 00:24:02,152
Mr. Gao!

368
00:24:02,152 --> 00:24:03,887
You can't quit just like that.

369
00:24:04,555 --> 00:24:05,656
He's still not here?

370
00:24:05,656 --> 00:24:06,457
He picked up the call

371
00:24:06,457 --> 00:24:07,858
but didn't say if he would return.

372
00:24:10,728 --> 00:24:11,328
Who are you?

373
00:24:12,629 --> 00:24:13,864
You're not allowed in here.

374
00:24:14,198 --> 00:24:15,032
Go away!

375
