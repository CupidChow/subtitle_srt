=Episode 11=

18
00:01:23,082 --> 00:01:24,582
(Fan Zherui's memory loss is a lie.)

19
00:01:24,582 --> 00:01:25,584
(If you want to see him,)

20
00:01:25,584 --> 00:01:27,594
(meet him at 10 PM in Room 703,
Shengyu Hotel.)

21
00:01:39,626 --> 00:01:40,927
Are you going to go find him?

22
00:01:44,764 --> 00:01:47,100
Do you think it's a good idea for me
to start dating Zherui again?

23
00:02:00,046 --> 00:02:01,514
As a parent, I hope

24
00:02:01,514 --> 00:02:03,249
that my child can be happy.

25
00:02:04,717 --> 00:02:05,618
Zherui...

26
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,354
He is too complicated.

27
00:02:09,422 --> 00:02:11,157
His family background...

28
00:02:12,492 --> 00:02:13,860
And you both are men.

29
00:02:14,527 --> 00:02:15,895
You should have known four years ago

30
00:02:15,895 --> 00:02:17,664
how challenging this path would be.

31
00:02:19,165 --> 00:02:20,066
I really...

32
00:02:26,806 --> 00:02:28,007
What would you do

33
00:02:28,007 --> 00:02:29,042
if Mother came back to you?

34
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:35,515
I miss him a lot.

35
00:02:36,583 --> 00:02:38,718
I opened this shop
specifically to wait for him.

36
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,021
The cakes I came up with

37
00:02:42,021 --> 00:02:43,756
are all ones I'd like to bake for him.

38
00:02:47,193 --> 00:02:48,194
I don't even know why

39
00:02:48,194 --> 00:02:49,529
I like him so much.

40
00:02:49,529 --> 00:02:51,164
I only like him.

41
00:02:51,764 --> 00:02:52,932
What about his feelings for you?

42
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:55,468
But what if he starts disliking you

43
00:02:55,468 --> 00:02:57,937
because he feels
you're holding him back?

44
00:02:58,505 --> 00:02:59,372
What if he tells you

45
00:03:00,306 --> 00:03:01,307
he no longer loves you?

46
00:03:05,245 --> 00:03:07,514
Actually, I've run into him before.

47
00:03:10,216 --> 00:03:10,917
Do you know him?

48
00:03:11,818 --> 00:03:12,519
No.

49
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:14,754
(He doesn't remember me.)

50
00:03:15,588 --> 00:03:16,723
Do we know each other?

51
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:18,625
(I'm very sad.)

52
00:03:19,792 --> 00:03:21,594
This makes me too afraid
to go look for him.

53
00:03:25,732 --> 00:03:27,200
However, you should take the initiative

54
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,902
to pursue what you like.

55
00:03:30,236 --> 00:03:32,639
It's a miracle
when the person you like also likes you.

56
00:03:33,373 --> 00:03:34,841
It doesn't happen just by hoping for it.

57
00:03:37,944 --> 00:03:38,878
I don't know what to do.

58
00:03:39,946 --> 00:03:40,980
But I'm going to give it a shot

59
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:42,115
as long as there's a chance.

60
00:03:44,017 --> 00:03:44,817
What if...

61
00:03:47,687 --> 00:03:48,488
I forbid it.

62
00:03:51,724 --> 00:03:53,560
He killed the person to save me.

63
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:56,029
But you wouldn't be
in this situation if it weren't for him.

64
00:03:56,362 --> 00:03:57,497
You could have a better life.

65
00:03:58,798 --> 00:04:00,466
If that were the case,
Jingyu and I would lose you.

66
00:04:01,901 --> 00:04:03,469
Not everything is in his control,

67
00:04:03,469 --> 00:04:04,604
and that's not his fault.

68
00:04:06,306 --> 00:04:07,273
Father,

69
00:04:07,273 --> 00:04:09,108
you need to forget about
those bad memories.

70
00:04:09,342 --> 00:04:10,843
The day goes on.

71
00:04:29,295 --> 00:04:30,630
If you're going to say it,

72
00:04:31,464 --> 00:04:32,732
you're going to do it.

73
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,400
Father.

74
00:04:36,069 --> 00:04:37,537
The day goes on.

75
00:04:38,972 --> 00:04:40,139
Don't look back.

76
00:04:46,179 --> 00:04:47,046
You...

77
00:04:48,948 --> 00:04:51,517
You should not consider yourself
to have failed my expectations simply

78
00:04:51,884 --> 00:04:53,019
because you did not

79
00:04:54,821 --> 00:04:57,190
attend university or become a doctor.

80
00:04:58,424 --> 00:05:00,093
I take great pride in you.

81
00:05:10,069 --> 00:05:11,504
Go get him back.

82
00:05:12,905 --> 00:05:13,806
Thanks, father.

83
00:05:20,546 --> 00:05:21,714
Your phone!

84
00:05:23,383 --> 00:05:24,284
Wallet.

85
00:05:25,218 --> 00:05:26,052
Take the jacket with you.

86
00:05:30,523 --> 00:05:31,624
Be careful.

87
00:06:06,259 --> 00:06:07,193
Zherui.

88
00:06:13,766 --> 00:06:14,834
Fan Jiang Ruichen?

89
00:06:17,003 --> 00:06:18,071
You know me?

90
00:06:19,539 --> 00:06:20,440
Where is Zherui?

91
00:06:23,876 --> 00:06:24,644
Room 708.

92
00:06:28,081 --> 00:06:28,981
Are you sure?

93
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:31,951
Diagonally opposite.

94
00:06:35,822 --> 00:06:36,622
Thanks.

95
00:06:49,302 --> 00:06:51,104
There's no going back
once the door is opened.

96
00:06:51,904 --> 00:06:52,972
Are you sure to open it?

97
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:56,709
Don't you hate him?

98
00:06:57,210 --> 00:06:58,277
You were supposed

99
00:06:58,277 --> 00:06:59,178
to be an intern

100
00:06:59,178 --> 00:07:00,513
for a promising medical career.

101
00:07:01,581 --> 00:07:03,683
All of your bad luck began
when you met him.

102
00:07:05,451 --> 00:07:06,953
I'd be lying if I said I didn't hate.

103
00:07:08,855 --> 00:07:10,556
The fact that I can't protect myself

104
00:07:11,357 --> 00:07:13,292
or him makes me

105
00:07:13,292 --> 00:07:14,293
hate myself.

106
00:07:17,764 --> 00:07:18,931
You deserve better.

107
00:07:20,066 --> 00:07:21,768
He is the best.

108
00:08:45,284 --> 00:08:46,085
Zherui,

109
00:08:46,085 --> 00:08:47,887
you didn't drink alcohol
with tranquilizers, right?

110
00:08:47,887 --> 00:08:48,955
Zherui!

111
00:08:48,955 --> 00:08:49,622
Zherui!

112
00:08:50,089 --> 00:08:51,424
Zherui! Wake up, Zherui!

113
00:08:52,191 --> 00:08:52,892
Zherui!

114
00:08:52,892 --> 00:08:53,960
Shut...

115
00:08:59,198 --> 00:08:59,999
What are you saying?

116
00:09:01,067 --> 00:09:02,335
Shut up.

117
00:09:04,036 --> 00:09:05,438
Let me sleep.

118
00:09:09,475 --> 00:09:10,743
Who do you miss?

119
00:09:11,978 --> 00:09:14,247
I'm going to find him.

120
00:09:16,048 --> 00:09:17,016
Who are you looking for?

121
00:09:35,067 --> 00:09:36,669
I miss you so much.

122
00:09:41,207 --> 00:09:42,909
I miss you so much.

123
00:09:44,243 --> 00:09:45,778

Okay, no problem.

Ai Di.

168
00:14:31,931 --> 00:14:32,898
Nice print.

169
00:14:33,098 --> 00:14:34,099
Mr. Yi is very handsome.

170
00:14:34,366 --> 00:14:35,568
Nonsense.

171
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:39,238
What does Chen Yi mean by this?

172
00:14:40,005 --> 00:14:41,140
Does he think I'm a sissy

173
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:42,341
for leaving Yiyun Sect?

174
00:14:42,341 --> 00:14:43,075
No.

175
00:14:43,075 --> 00:14:44,443
Don't get him wrong.

176
00:14:45,811 --> 00:14:46,812
The card.

177
00:14:46,812 --> 00:14:47,880
He wrote a card.

178
00:14:56,216 --> 00:14:57,921
(Chen Yi)

179
00:14:58,424 --> 00:15:00,426
Why would I want his signature?

180
00:15:00,426 --> 00:15:01,994
Did he think he is a celebrity?

181
00:15:02,962 --> 00:15:03,829
Take it back.

182
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,368
Go back.

183
00:15:10,069 --> 00:15:10,903
Shall I go?

184
00:15:10,903 --> 00:15:11,871
Yes!

185
00:15:22,815 --> 00:15:24,450
You assure me that he will like it.

186
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:25,784
My girlfriend really likes it.

187
00:15:25,784 --> 00:15:27,553
She even asked me to buy
the one in actual size.

188
00:15:27,553 --> 00:15:28,821
It's not like that, Mr. Yi.

189
00:15:28,821 --> 00:15:30,589
You didn't write clearly on your card.

190
00:15:30,589 --> 00:15:32,224
You even got me scolded by Ai Di.

191
00:15:32,224 --> 00:15:34,059
It's not enough to simply sign it.

192
00:15:34,059 --> 00:15:34,793
Then how?

193
00:15:35,361 --> 00:15:36,962
You must write out
what you intend to say.

194
00:15:37,329 --> 00:15:38,898
And the things Ai Di likes.

195
00:15:39,465 --> 00:15:40,799
What things?

196
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:42,501
How would I know?

197
00:15:43,102 --> 00:15:45,137
Didn't you grow up with Ai Di?

198
00:15:45,137 --> 00:15:47,506
You should know him best.

199
00:15:47,506 --> 00:15:48,707
Mr. Yi,

200
00:15:48,707 --> 00:15:50,109
you're really lame.

201
00:15:50,409 --> 00:15:51,677
My skills are better than yours.

202
00:16:10,262 --> 00:16:10,963
Welcome.

203
00:16:19,138 --> 00:16:19,905
Mr. Fan.

204
00:16:19,905 --> 00:16:20,906
This is hot coffee.

205
00:16:20,906 --> 00:16:22,541
And Zherui's favorite,
the strawberry cake.

206
00:16:22,541 --> 00:16:23,375
Please enjoy.

207
00:16:26,312 --> 00:16:27,112
This is a cake

208
00:16:27,112 --> 00:16:28,347
made entirely

209
00:16:28,347 --> 00:16:29,348
of strawberries.

210
00:16:32,251 --> 00:16:33,018
Sit.

211
00:16:40,159 --> 00:16:41,760
Since you know who I am,

212
00:16:42,528 --> 00:16:44,196
let's get straight to the point.

213
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:45,497
Hold on.

214
00:16:46,598 --> 00:16:48,167
Can I record this?

215
00:16:50,269 --> 00:16:52,404
I have short-term memory loss,
so I'm afraid I'll forget.

216
00:16:55,874 --> 00:16:57,343
You're not afraid of me?

217
00:16:58,644 --> 00:17:00,079
You're the grandfather of Zherui,

218
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:01,380
and soon you'll be mine too.

219
00:17:03,682 --> 00:17:04,917
You should be afraid of me.

220
00:17:07,152 --> 00:17:09,888
I will not approve of your relationship.

221
00:17:11,357 --> 00:17:13,225
The Fan Family can't lose face.

222
00:17:13,792 --> 00:17:15,661
Then please return Zherui to me.

223
00:17:17,396 --> 00:17:18,831
Except Fan Zherui,

224
00:17:19,665 --> 00:17:20,833
what do you want?

225
00:17:21,667 --> 00:17:23,969
I don't want anything except Zherui.

226
00:17:30,209 --> 00:17:31,510
You're still young.

227
00:17:32,277 --> 00:17:34,413
You have no idea
what you're missing out on.

228
00:17:34,747 --> 00:17:36,048
A lot of people are hoping

229
00:17:36,715 --> 00:17:38,684
to answer me.

230
00:17:39,485 --> 00:17:41,020
If you want something,

231
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:43,522
all you have to do is answer me.

232
00:17:45,991 --> 00:17:48,694
Nothing in this world
is beyond the reach of wealth.

233
00:17:51,397 --> 00:17:52,898
You've seen and done too much,

234
00:17:52,898 --> 00:17:55,000
forgotten how much
you've lost, and as a result,

235
00:17:55,534 --> 00:17:57,536
you believe that
everything can be bought with money.

236
00:18:07,613 --> 00:18:09,348
This is the last chance.

237
00:18:10,783 --> 00:18:12,117
What do you want?

238
00:18:14,319 --> 00:18:15,654
I want Zherui to be happy.

239
00:18:22,461 --> 00:18:23,762
(What do you want?)

240
00:18:24,763 --> 00:18:26,098
(I want Zherui to be happy.)

241
00:18:29,435 --> 00:18:31,403
Mr. Fan has a lot of doubts about you.

242
00:18:32,371 --> 00:18:34,139
I can't believe he came to Taichung.

243
00:18:34,907 --> 00:18:36,208
Luckily his assistant is my man.

244
00:18:38,911 --> 00:18:40,179
What are you going to do?

245
00:18:45,417 --> 00:18:46,485
You are crying?

246
00:18:52,091 --> 00:18:52,991
Sorry.

247
00:18:53,859 --> 00:18:55,294
We're going to change the plan.

248
00:19:00,032 --> 00:19:01,834
Take note of the cake's shelf life.

249
00:19:01,834 --> 00:19:03,535
If it has not been sold,
it must be recalled.

250
00:19:07,573 --> 00:19:09,641
Make sure the decorated side
is facing the customers

251
00:19:09,641 --> 00:19:11,276
when setting out the cake.

252
00:19:14,613 --> 00:19:15,681
What's wrong?

253
00:19:15,681 --> 00:19:17,149
Something seems to be on your mind.

254
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:19,084
No, it's nothing.

255
00:19:21,086 --> 00:19:23,422
Are you dating Zherui?

256
00:19:23,689 --> 00:19:24,556
How do you...

257
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:25,958
I overheard your conversation

258
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:27,526
with the elderly.

259
00:19:30,496 --> 00:19:32,197
This is the last chance.

260
00:19:32,731 --> 00:19:34,032
What do you want?

261
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,201
I want Zherui to be happy.

262
00:19:40,873 --> 00:19:42,908
Is Zherui Mr. Gao?

263
00:19:45,577 --> 00:19:47,479
I forgot my wallet one day.

264
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:51,350
When I came back,
I saw you and Mr. Gao were...

265
00:19:54,419 --> 00:19:55,854
So Zherui is Mr. Gao?

266
00:19:57,890 --> 00:19:58,991
This is a long story.

267
00:20:00,259 --> 00:20:01,660
You didn't finish high school

268
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:03,996
because you were expelled
when the school discovered

269
00:20:03,996 --> 00:20:05,430
you two were dating?

270
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:06,265
No.

271
00:20:10,402 --> 00:20:11,837
I will tell you later.

272
00:20:12,871 --> 00:20:13,705
Okay.

273
00:20:15,174 --> 00:20:16,441
We've been so busy that we haven't

274
00:20:16,441 --> 00:20:18,076
had a chance
to have a real conversation.

275
00:20:18,076 --> 00:20:18,944
Yeah.

276
00:20:19,344 --> 00:20:20,512
Hello.

277
00:20:20,512 --> 00:20:21,580
Manager, I am here again.

278
00:20:22,948 --> 00:20:24,383
You have strawberry cakes today?

279
00:20:24,383 --> 00:20:25,817
Then I'll take one.

280
00:20:25,817 --> 00:20:27,886
And a cup of iced Americano.

281
00:20:27,886 --> 00:20:29,288
Okay, please have a seat.

282
00:20:29,288 --> 00:20:30,489
- Thank you.
- I'll handle the drink.

283
00:20:30,489 --> 00:20:31,290
Okay.

284
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:44,102
(Zhanhong Industries is involved
in a money laundering scandal.)

285
00:20:44,503 --> 00:20:46,705
(At 10:27 AM today, judicial units,)

286
00:20:46,705 --> 00:20:48,707
(following a lengthy investigation,)

287
00:20:48,707 --> 00:20:50,075
(entered the Zhanhong
Industries offices)

288
00:20:50,075 --> 00:20:52,578
(on the 7th floor of the Fanya Building
to conduct further investigation,)

289
00:20:52,578 --> 00:20:54,213
(collect evidence,
and schedule an interview)

290
00:20:54,213 --> 00:20:57,216
(with Fan Jiahong, a key member
of the company's management.)

291
00:20:57,883 --> 00:20:59,952
(Because of the money
laundering scandal,)

292
00:20:59,952 --> 00:21:02,554
(the stocks of Fanya's
companies have plummeted.)

293
00:21:02,554 --> 00:21:04,356
(According to the spokesperson
for Fanya Group,)

294
00:21:04,356 --> 00:21:05,958
(everything goes into
the legal process.)

295
00:21:05,958 --> 00:21:07,226
(The investigation is confidential,)

296
00:21:07,226 --> 00:21:09,628
(and the truth is still
being clarified.)

297
00:21:10,729 --> 00:21:12,297
The third uncle's money laundering case,

298
00:21:12,998 --> 00:21:14,800
the big uncle's bribery case
involving gift vouchers,

299
00:21:15,067 --> 00:21:17,302
and the fifth aunt's
spending record for aiding a person.

300
00:21:18,537 --> 00:21:21,273
Secret money Fanya has given
to politicians over the years.

301
00:21:21,873 --> 00:21:23,075
I have so much more.

302
00:21:23,675 --> 00:21:24,843
Including voice recordings.

303
00:21:33,018 --> 00:21:34,253
What do you want?

304
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:36,388
Freedom.

305
00:21:36,655 --> 00:21:37,956
I want to leave the Fan Family.

306
00:21:39,391 --> 00:21:41,760
Because of a man who sells desserts?

307
00:21:42,828 --> 00:21:44,129
I love him.

308
00:21:50,402 --> 00:21:53,138
I told you to watch out for him,
but you wouldn't listen.

309
00:21:55,907 --> 00:21:56,808
Sorry, Grandfather.

310
00:22:03,115 --> 00:22:05,951
Eldest daughter of Mr. Hong
from Weida Group

311
00:22:05,951 --> 00:22:07,352
has a crush on you.

312
00:22:08,387 --> 00:22:10,322
After you agree to marry her,

313
00:22:10,589 --> 00:22:12,791
you are free to do whatever you want,

314
00:22:13,659 --> 00:22:16,495
as long as it does not
harm the Fan Family's interests.

315
00:22:17,963 --> 00:22:19,097
I will get married.

316
00:22:19,097 --> 00:22:20,065
Only to Zongyi.

317
00:22:22,734 --> 00:22:24,369
Marriage between two men is now legal.

318
00:22:24,703 --> 00:22:25,971
We will send you a wedding invitation.

319
00:22:27,472 --> 00:22:29,474
How dare you speak to me like this?

320
00:22:32,244 --> 00:22:34,513
I used to work really hard
at being a good member

321
00:22:34,513 --> 00:22:35,947
of the Fan Family to win your approval.

322
00:22:39,017 --> 00:22:40,385
However, the harder I work

323
00:22:40,385 --> 00:22:41,620
and the better I do,

324
00:22:41,987 --> 00:22:43,322
the more you hate me.

325
00:22:49,294 --> 00:22:50,295
I know that no matter

326
00:22:50,729 --> 00:22:52,297
how good I am, you will always see me

327
00:22:52,698 --> 00:22:54,533
as a worthless one
because I am an illegitimate child.

328
00:23:02,207 --> 00:23:04,343
Can we both take a step back
if you don't want

329
00:23:06,411 --> 00:23:08,180
any more mishaps in this family?

330
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:08,947
Grandfather.

331
00:23:22,928 --> 00:23:23,829
What do you think?

332
00:23:26,998 --> 00:23:28,900
I heard Weida Group's
eldest daughter is nice,

333
00:23:29,267 --> 00:23:30,469
highly educated and competent,

334
00:23:30,769 --> 00:23:31,803
and very decisive.

335
00:23:36,174 --> 00:23:37,376
You're interested in her?

336
00:23:37,976 --> 00:23:38,844
I may give it a try.

337
00:23:40,212 --> 00:23:41,580
I should get married too.

338
00:23:49,688 --> 00:23:50,989
What about him?

339
00:23:50,989 --> 00:23:52,124
What are you going to do with him?

340
00:23:52,691 --> 00:23:53,692
Leave it to me.

341
00:23:55,327 --> 00:23:56,561
There's a job

342
00:23:57,329 --> 00:23:58,497
for even the most worthless one.

343
00:24:13,645 --> 00:24:15,547
I didn't expect you
to help me to this extent.

344
00:24:15,547 --> 00:24:17,182
It's because he wanted to help you.

345
00:24:17,716 --> 00:24:18,717
Seventh Uncle?

346
00:24:18,717 --> 00:24:20,352
I'll treat him to a meal another time.

347
00:24:20,352 --> 00:24:21,353
Don't bother him.

348
00:24:23,522 --> 00:24:24,423
Got it.

349
00:24:25,390 --> 00:24:26,291
This time I owe you.

350
00:24:27,159 --> 00:24:28,727
Repay me with your job performance.

351
00:24:29,127 --> 00:24:30,996
You will be in charge
of Xuan'en Tech from now on.

352
00:24:31,530 --> 00:24:32,397
Have a good performance.

353
00:24:36,568 --> 00:24:37,569
