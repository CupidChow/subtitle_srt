<i>[Kiseki: Dear to Me 08]</i>

17
00:01:21,004 --> 00:01:22,329
Didn't he get back yet?

18
00:01:22,329 --> 00:01:23,129
He answered the phone.

19
00:01:23,129 --> 00:01:24,531
But he didn't say whether he would come back.

20
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:28,001
<i>What do you want?</i>

21
00:01:29,302 --> 00:01:30,704
- Let go.
- Get out.

22
00:01:30,704 --> 00:01:31,705
Let go.

23
00:01:31,705 --> 00:01:32,722
Who are you?

24
00:01:32,722 --> 00:01:33,607
Let go.

25
00:01:33,607 --> 00:01:34,107
What do you want?

26
00:01:34,107 --> 00:01:35,575
- Let go.
- He is Ai Di.

27
00:01:43,249 --> 00:01:44,375
Why do you dress up like this?

28
00:01:47,153 --> 00:01:48,175
What?

29
00:01:50,991 --> 00:01:51,950
What's wrong with your hand?

30
00:01:53,593 --> 00:01:54,825
It's not a big deal.

31
00:01:55,562 --> 00:01:56,596
Good-for-nothing.

32
00:01:59,199 --> 00:02:00,333
Don't you know me?

33
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:07,807
Report it to me

34
00:02:07,807 --> 00:02:09,843
as long as there is any news about Zhang Teng.

35
00:02:09,843 --> 00:02:11,211
And,

36
00:02:11,211 --> 00:02:12,646
send more people to protect Ruei.

37
00:02:15,181 --> 00:02:16,650
Why do you send people to protect Ruei?

38
00:02:25,859 --> 00:02:26,927
I prefer you to dress like this.

39
00:02:28,595 --> 00:02:29,429
What?

40
00:02:31,264 --> 00:02:32,065
Nothing.

41
00:02:33,233 --> 00:02:34,668
Did you go to school
as an undercover agent to help Ruei

42
00:02:34,668 --> 00:02:36,503
during the period when you lost contact?

43
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:41,574
He said no suspicious people were found

44
00:02:41,574 --> 00:02:43,043
after investigating all the faculty and staff.

45
00:02:43,043 --> 00:02:44,678
He suspected that it was not a faculty

46
00:02:44,678 --> 00:02:45,679
but a student

47
00:02:45,679 --> 00:02:46,813
who connected with Zhang Teng.

48
00:02:46,813 --> 00:02:48,214
So, he asked me to pretend to be a student

49
00:02:48,214 --> 00:02:49,750
to take business away from him.

50
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:51,118
So I caught that guy.

51
00:02:51,118 --> 00:02:52,886
Students are too naive.

52
00:02:53,887 --> 00:02:55,155
Why didn't you inform me in advance?

53
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:57,357
You helped him

54
00:02:57,357 --> 00:02:59,059
and I couldn't get in touch with you
are two different matters.

55
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:01,494
Why should I inform you?

56
00:03:01,494 --> 00:03:02,529
Are you my mother?

57
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:04,931
My mother doesn't care about me.
Why do you?

58
00:03:04,931 --> 00:03:05,565
Ai Di.

59
00:03:07,968 --> 00:03:09,202
What?

60
00:03:09,202 --> 00:03:10,904
You went to Zhang Teng without me.

61
00:03:10,904 --> 00:03:12,072
Can't I do the same thing?

62
00:03:12,072 --> 00:03:13,323
I didn't mean that.

63
00:03:13,323 --> 00:03:14,875
You didn't want me to find you.

64
00:03:14,875 --> 00:03:16,343
You didn't answer my phone.

65
00:03:16,343 --> 00:03:17,344
If it weren't for my injury,

66
00:03:17,344 --> 00:03:18,511
you wouldn't have come to me.

67
00:03:18,511 --> 00:03:20,780
I thought you didn't
treat me as a brother anymore.

68
00:03:31,424 --> 00:03:32,625
Do you want to continue school?

69
00:03:35,061 --> 00:03:36,262
Don't joke.

70
00:03:38,631 --> 00:03:39,499
If you want to, I can...

71
00:03:39,499 --> 00:03:41,167
How is it going about Zhang Teng?

72
00:03:42,569 --> 00:03:43,837
Why do you send people to protect Ruei?

73
00:04:05,258 --> 00:04:06,059
Bai Zongyi...

74
00:04:07,227 --> 00:04:08,361
Could you please put it away?

75
00:04:08,361 --> 00:04:09,579
Why?

76
00:04:09,579 --> 00:04:11,398
This is the admission notice of
the medical school.

77
00:04:11,398 --> 00:04:12,298
I will frame it up

78
00:04:12,298 --> 00:04:13,333
and hang it up as a souvenir.

79
00:04:14,134 --> 00:04:14,801
Alright, give it back to me.

80
00:04:14,801 --> 00:04:15,635
Let's watch it when we get back home.

81
00:04:16,903 --> 00:04:17,871
Put it in.

82
00:04:17,871 --> 00:04:18,838
Be careful.

83
00:04:25,779 --> 00:04:27,247
Are you getting married?

84
00:04:27,247 --> 00:04:28,581
You are so beautiful. Wish you happiness.

85
00:04:28,581 --> 00:04:29,783
Wish you happiness.

86
00:04:31,251 --> 00:04:32,185
There's another couple.

87
00:04:40,927 --> 00:04:42,262
<i>On Friday,</i>

88
00:04:42,262 --> 00:04:44,364
<i>May 24, 2019,</i>

89
00:04:45,265 --> 00:04:46,966
<i>the gay marriage bill</i>

90
00:04:46,966 --> 00:04:49,102
<i>came into effect.</i>

91
00:04:50,003 --> 00:04:52,906
<i>Both same-sex and heterosexual couples</i>

92
00:04:52,906 --> 00:04:54,707
<i>can register for marriage.</i>

93
00:04:55,608 --> 00:04:58,111
<i>They can write down
their lover's name in the spouse column.</i>

94
00:05:02,182 --> 00:05:03,850
I'm going to move in with you.

95
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:05,385
I am free on Saturday.

96
00:05:08,421 --> 00:05:10,056
Let's have a feast

97
00:05:10,056 --> 00:05:11,357
to celebrate your admission.

98
00:05:12,092 --> 00:05:13,093
And

99
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,228
we are finally going to live together.

100
00:05:29,209 --> 00:05:30,260
Wish you happiness.

101
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:31,528
Wish you happiness.

102
00:05:31,528 --> 00:05:32,378
Thank you.

103
00:05:32,378 --> 00:05:33,513
We will.

104
00:05:39,552 --> 00:05:40,386
Let's go.

105
00:05:50,029 --> 00:05:51,364
<i>This day</i>

106
00:05:52,165 --> 00:05:53,900
<i>is the beginning of our future</i>

107
00:05:56,236 --> 00:05:57,237
<i>and</i>

108
00:05:58,505 --> 00:06:00,006
<i>our end.</i>

109
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:07,931
<i>Stop.</i>

110
00:06:07,931 --> 00:06:08,915
<i>Come here.</i>

111
00:06:09,883 --> 00:06:11,434
Zhang Teng still has relatives.

112
00:06:11,434 --> 00:06:13,887
I thought his parents were dead.

113
00:06:13,887 --> 00:06:16,490
It turns out that his mother
ran off with someone when he was a kid.

114
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:18,691
His father was killed by him.

115
00:06:19,492 --> 00:06:21,294
When he was 14...

116
00:06:21,294 --> 00:06:22,695
He was crazier than me.

117
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:25,398
You are different from him.

118
00:06:26,366 --> 00:06:28,935
Nonsense, I am much better than him.

119
00:06:28,935 --> 00:06:30,870
This is not what mean.

120
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:31,671
Stop.

121
00:06:31,671 --> 00:06:32,605
Hurry.

122
00:06:36,309 --> 00:06:37,277
Stop.

123
00:06:37,277 --> 00:06:38,378
Stop.

124
00:06:38,378 --> 00:06:39,145
Come here.

125
00:06:49,255 --> 00:06:50,423
Run if you can.

126
00:06:55,061 --> 00:06:58,164
Why are you helping Chen Yi against me?

127
00:06:58,164 --> 00:06:59,499
Run when you get a chance.

128
00:06:59,499 --> 00:07:00,934
- Let's run together.
- Listen to me.

129
00:07:00,934 --> 00:07:02,035
Call the police when you get out.

130
00:07:21,321 --> 00:07:22,722
Hello, Ruei.

131
00:07:22,722 --> 00:07:23,656
How is it going?

132
00:07:23,656 --> 00:07:24,774
<i>Come on.</i>

133
00:07:24,774 --> 00:07:25,858
<i>Zhang Teng.</i>

134
00:07:25,858 --> 00:07:27,126
<i>He is not in our league.</i>

135
00:07:27,126 --> 00:07:28,228
<i>Let him go.</i>

136
00:07:34,767 --> 00:07:35,602
Bai Zongyi.

137
00:07:36,836 --> 00:07:37,804
Zhang Teng.

138
00:07:41,874 --> 00:07:43,876
He is not in our league. Let him go.

139
00:07:50,183 --> 00:07:51,217
Jheruei.

140
00:07:58,524 --> 00:08:00,226
Do you want to die together?

141
00:08:03,062 --> 00:08:04,097
Jheruei.

142
00:08:14,407 --> 00:08:15,842
Zhang Teng.

143
00:08:23,883 --> 00:08:24,817
Zhang Teng.

144
00:08:27,253 --> 00:08:28,488
He is not in our league.

145
00:08:28,488 --> 00:08:29,589
He is innocent.

146
00:08:29,589 --> 00:08:31,658
Let him go.

147
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:33,126
Jheruei.

148
00:08:39,265 --> 00:08:40,500
Jheruei.

149
00:08:55,648 --> 00:08:57,016
Please.

150
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:14,551
It has nothing to do with him.

151
00:09:14,551 --> 00:09:16,002
Let him go.

152
00:09:16,002 --> 00:09:17,570
Let him go.

153
00:09:28,614 --> 00:09:29,949
<i>Is this your first time at headquarters?</i>

154
00:09:33,152 --> 00:09:34,487
<i>What's your name?</i>

155
00:09:58,144 --> 00:09:59,645
<i>Annoying.</i>

156
00:09:59,645 --> 00:10:00,546
<i>I got you.</i>

157
00:10:03,883 --> 00:10:06,486
<i>The bosses of our two sides
want to talk about peace today.</i>

158
00:10:06,486 --> 00:10:08,588
<i>You look like you want to fight. Is that right?</i>

159
00:10:13,593 --> 00:10:14,360
<i>Get out.</i>

160
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,128
<i>Or I will...</i>

161
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,401
<i>Here.</i>

162
00:10:21,401 --> 00:10:22,635
<i>It's a gift for you.</i>

163
00:10:22,635 --> 00:10:23,836
<i>Kindly give us your advice.</i>

164
00:10:23,836 --> 00:10:24,837
<i>Zhang Teng.</i>

165
00:11:10,049 --> 00:11:11,417
The more you care about him,

166
00:11:12,819 --> 00:11:14,620
the more I want to kill him.

167
00:11:20,426 --> 00:11:22,662
<i>Ruei.</i>

168
00:11:22,662 --> 00:11:23,896
<i>Bai Zongyi.</i>

169
00:11:23,896 --> 00:11:25,682
<i>Where are you?</i>

170
00:11:25,682 --> 00:11:26,966
<i>Fan Jheruei.</i>

171
00:11:26,966 --> 00:11:27,967
Someone's coming.

172
00:11:29,502 --> 00:11:31,437
Get out.

173
00:11:31,437 --> 00:11:32,939
<i>Bai Zongyi.</i>

174
00:11:32,939 --> 00:11:34,440
I'll lure them away.

175
00:11:37,109 --> 00:11:38,211
What do you want?

176
00:11:49,188 --> 00:11:51,624
Blame Fan Jheruei.

177
00:11:51,624 --> 00:11:52,992
You are unlucky

178
00:11:52,992 --> 00:11:54,660
to know him.

179
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:55,962
Stop.

180
00:12:06,739 --> 00:12:07,640
Jheruei.

181
00:12:09,842 --> 00:12:10,977
Stop. It's fine.

182
00:12:10,977 --> 00:12:12,078
It's fine.

183
00:12:12,078 --> 00:12:13,096
Jheruei.

184
00:12:13,096 --> 00:12:14,314
Jheruei.

185
00:12:14,314 --> 00:12:16,082
Jheruei.

186
00:12:16,082 --> 00:12:17,283
I am sorry.

187
00:12:18,084 --> 00:12:19,218
It's fine.

188
00:12:19,218 --> 00:12:20,620
Hold on.

189
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:21,954
I am sorry.

190
00:12:22,989 --> 00:12:24,323
It's all my fault.

191
00:12:24,323 --> 00:12:25,391
Stop talking.

192
00:12:26,592 --> 00:12:27,760
Hold on.

193
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,162
I shouldn't have gotten acquainted with you.

194
00:12:30,162 --> 00:12:31,230
Stop talking.

195
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:32,215
Stop talking.

196
00:12:32,215 --> 00:12:33,799
I...

197
00:12:33,799 --> 00:12:35,167
Jheruei, don't close your eyes.

198
00:12:35,167 --> 00:12:35,968
Jheruei.

199
00:12:35,968 --> 00:12:37,320
Jheruei, look at me.

200
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,088
Jheruei, look at me.

201
00:12:39,088 --> 00:12:41,173
Jheruei, look at me.

202
00:12:41,173 --> 00:12:42,408
Jheruei, wake up.

203
00:12:42,408 --> 00:12:43,543
Jheruei.

204
00:12:43,543 --> 00:12:45,144
Jheruei.

205
00:13:26,686 --> 00:13:28,037
Jheruei.

206
00:13:28,037 --> 00:13:29,322
Bai Zongyi, let go.

207
00:13:31,824 --> 00:13:32,792
Bai Zongyi.

208
00:13:32,792 --> 00:13:34,010
Jheruei.

209
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:34,794
Bai Zongyi, let go.

210
00:13:34,794 --> 00:13:35,828
Jheruei.

211
00:13:35,828 --> 00:13:37,563
If you don't let go, he will die.

212
00:13:47,607 --> 00:13:48,941
Bai Zongyi, let go.

213
00:13:48,941 --> 00:13:51,010
Two injured people who need help.

214
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:52,178
We will be there in 20 minutes.

215
00:13:52,912 --> 00:13:54,163
One of them is...

216
00:13:54,163 --> 00:13:55,348
Fan Jheruei.

217
00:13:57,016 --> 00:13:58,384
I will tell our boss.

218
00:14:00,252 --> 00:14:01,320
Save him.

219
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,488
Let go.

220
00:14:31,217 --> 00:14:32,284
What if he asks me?

221
00:14:33,686 --> 00:14:34,520
What can we do?

222
00:14:40,926 --> 00:14:41,594
You can't go.

223
00:14:41,594 --> 00:14:42,728
I want to see Jheruei.

224
00:14:42,728 --> 00:14:43,529
- No.
- Don't go.

225
00:14:43,529 --> 00:14:44,263
Come back.

226
00:14:44,263 --> 00:14:45,865
- You can't go.
- You can't go.

227
00:14:45,865 --> 00:14:46,799
He will get the best treatment

228
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:47,566
at the Fan family's hospital.

229
00:14:47,566 --> 00:14:49,001
- I've been waiting for three days.
- He will be all right.

230
00:14:49,001 --> 00:14:50,403
- You can't go.
- I want to see him.

231
00:14:50,403 --> 00:14:51,871
Bai Zongyi.

232
00:14:51,871 --> 00:14:53,239
Zhang Teng's people are still out there.

233
00:14:53,239 --> 00:14:54,473
It's not safe for you to go there.

234
00:14:54,473 --> 00:14:56,575
The doctor said
he suffered a severe head injury.

235
00:14:56,575 --> 00:14:58,010
- Cut it out.
- You can't go.

236
00:14:58,010 --> 00:14:59,378
You can't go.

237
00:15:02,348 --> 00:15:04,817
Why don't you let me see him?

238
00:15:05,518 --> 00:15:06,919
Why?

239
00:15:09,088 --> 00:15:09,955
Let me go.

240
00:15:37,717 --> 00:15:38,350
Hello.

241
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:39,452
<i>Brother.</i>

242
00:15:40,352 --> 00:15:42,388
I am at the hospital with Dad.

243
00:15:43,622 --> 00:15:44,774
What's wrong with Dad?

244
00:15:44,774 --> 00:15:47,143
<i>He suddenly fainted</i>

245
00:15:47,143 --> 00:15:48,861
<i>at work.</i>

246
00:15:50,229 --> 00:15:51,931
The doctor said Dad's heart problem

247
00:15:51,931 --> 00:15:54,033
was very serious.

248
00:15:54,033 --> 00:15:56,686
<i>If he doesn't get proper treatment, he will...</i>

249
00:15:56,686 --> 00:15:59,371
<i>I don't know what to do.</i>

250
00:15:59,371 --> 00:16:00,539
I'm scared.

251
00:16:00,539 --> 00:16:02,541
Brother.

252
00:16:03,809 --> 00:16:04,777
Okay.

253
00:16:04,777 --> 00:16:06,078
I will be there in a minute.

254
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:08,848
Get out.

255
00:16:08,848 --> 00:16:09,715
What do you want?

256
00:16:10,483 --> 00:16:11,350
Get out.

257
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:15,888
Make a deal with me,

258
00:16:15,888 --> 00:16:17,022
boy.

259
00:16:49,455 --> 00:16:50,489
Don't worry.

260
00:16:50,489 --> 00:16:52,174
Dad will be all right.

261
00:16:52,174 --> 00:16:53,392
Don't worry about him.

262
00:16:59,865 --> 00:17:01,767
Everything will be all right.

263
00:17:04,303 --> 00:17:06,038
Everything will be all right.

264
00:17:07,139 --> 00:17:08,941
<i>Zhang Teng is dead.</i>

265
00:17:08,941 --> 00:17:10,242
<i>Two of his men were seriously injured.</i>

266
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:12,295
The Dargon Gang has already

267
00:17:12,295 --> 00:17:14,079
dealt with fugitives.

268
00:17:16,115 --> 00:17:18,951
The cops are investigating the case.

269
00:17:18,951 --> 00:17:20,486
They want to find

270
00:17:20,486 --> 00:17:22,121
Zhang Teng's killer.

271
00:17:23,255 --> 00:17:25,090
Jheruei killed him to protect me.

272
00:17:25,090 --> 00:17:26,192
Things can be like this,

273
00:17:27,193 --> 00:17:28,394
or not.

274
00:17:30,863 --> 00:17:31,664
It's your decision.

275
00:17:34,366 --> 00:17:35,801
Why do you want him to take the fall?

276
00:17:35,801 --> 00:17:36,936
We should let our people take the fall.

277
00:17:36,936 --> 00:17:37,736
It has nothing to do with him.

278
00:17:37,736 --> 00:17:39,271
It's Mr. Fan's order.

279
00:17:43,909 --> 00:17:45,911
As long as you are willing to turn yourself in

280
00:17:45,911 --> 00:17:47,646
and admit

281
00:17:47,646 --> 00:17:48,781
that you did everything,

282
00:17:49,949 --> 00:17:51,750
your father will be able to

283
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:53,152
perform a heart transplant in no time.

284
00:17:53,152 --> 00:17:54,220
How is that possible?

285
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:55,054
My dad has been in line for surgery

286
00:17:55,054 --> 00:17:56,255
for several years.

287
00:17:57,456 --> 00:17:58,958
Mr. Fan

288
00:17:58,958 --> 00:18:00,125
never breaks his word.

289
00:18:03,262 --> 00:18:04,697
You will get a paired heart,

290
00:18:04,697 --> 00:18:06,082
surgery fee,

291
00:18:06,082 --> 00:18:08,801
the money for postoperative recovery,

292
00:18:09,635 --> 00:18:10,936
and a settlement fee.

293
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:18,744
The old man knew

294
00:18:18,744 --> 00:18:20,713
the relationship between
Fan Jheruei and Bai Zongyi.

295
00:18:21,747 --> 00:18:23,415
So he wants him
to take the fall to break them up.

296
00:18:25,751 --> 00:18:26,469
Boss.

297
00:18:26,469 --> 00:18:28,020
Zhang Teng's death
has nothing to do with Bai Zongyi.

298
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:29,388
It's our business.

299
00:18:32,791 --> 00:18:33,959
Of course, it's your fault.

300
00:18:35,861 --> 00:18:37,146
You think you are tough now?

301
00:18:37,146 --> 00:18:38,564
You think you can make the decision?

302
00:18:41,467 --> 00:18:43,285
You didn't report the problem to me.

303
00:18:43,285 --> 00:18:44,870
You get ahead of yourself.

304
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:46,105
You play hardball.

305
00:18:46,105 --> 00:18:48,540
And you involved an unrelated person.

306
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:49,875
You think you are great?

307
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:55,915
I am very

308
00:18:57,283 --> 00:18:59,451
disappointed in you.

309
00:19:12,498 --> 00:19:13,465
You are underage.

310
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,886
It's better for you
to take the fall for Jheruei

311
00:19:16,886 --> 00:19:18,404
than for him to turn himself in.

312
00:19:22,174 --> 00:19:23,075
Think about it.

313
00:19:35,788 --> 00:19:36,889
<i>After you move in,</i>

314
00:19:36,889 --> 00:19:38,257
<i>we will put the plants here.</i>

315
00:19:38,257 --> 00:19:39,291
<i>We can sit here,</i>

316
00:19:39,291 --> 00:19:41,277
<i>drinking coffee, enjoying the view,</i>

317
00:19:41,277 --> 00:19:42,862
<i>and eating desserts.</i>

318
00:19:42,862 --> 00:19:43,729
<i>Yeah, dessert.</i>

319
00:19:43,729 --> 00:19:44,897
<i>Come.</i>

320
00:19:44,897 --> 00:19:46,398
<i>Then,</i>

321
00:19:46,398 --> 00:19:48,334
<i>you can make desserts here.</i>

322
00:19:48,334 --> 00:19:49,601
<i>I will buy you some cookers.</i>

323
00:19:49,601 --> 00:19:50,903
<i>I will cook here.</i>

324
00:19:50,903 --> 00:19:52,271
<i>You will make desserts here.</i>

325
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:55,708
<i>And,</i>

326
00:19:57,543 --> 00:19:58,944
<i>you have many books.</i>

327
00:19:58,944 --> 00:19:59,878
<i>You can put</i>

328
00:19:59,878 --> 00:20:00,980
<i>your books here.</i>

329
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:01,814
<i>Then,</i>

330
00:20:06,151 --> 00:20:07,786
<i>this is for you.</i>

331
00:20:07,786 --> 00:20:10,456
<i>It will accompany you to school.</i>

332
00:20:10,456 --> 00:20:11,690
<i>Use it only.</i>

333
00:20:12,725 --> 00:20:13,525
<i>Okay.</i>

334
00:20:28,307 --> 00:20:30,042
<i>Think of this as a ring.</i>

335
00:20:30,042 --> 00:20:31,310
<i>When I become a doctor</i>

336
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:32,277
<i>and earn enough money,</i>

337
00:20:32,277 --> 00:20:33,045
<i>I will buy you a real one.</i>

338
00:20:38,684 --> 00:20:40,269
<i>Don't rush to grow up.</i>

339
00:20:40,269 --> 00:20:41,687

340
00:20:41,687 --> 00:20:42,855

<i>Engagement ring.</i>

344
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:12,051
<i>How did you come up with it?</i>

345
00:22:32,531 --> 00:22:33,899
<i>Brother,</i>

346
00:22:33,899 --> 00:22:35,767
<i>how are you doing?</i>

347
00:22:35,767 --> 00:22:38,337
<i>The doctor says Dad's doing great.</i>

348
00:22:38,337 --> 00:22:40,790
<i>He did not experience rejection
after the heart transplant.</i>

349
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:42,508

00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:52,325
<i>♫ is too far for me to do anything ♫</i>

375
00:25:52,325 --> 00:25:56,741
<i>♫ Am I a bird in love with fish ♫</i>

376
00:25:56,741 --> 00:25:59,050
<i>♫ I am so silly ♫</i>

377
00:25:59,050 --> 00:26:03,150
<i>♫ I've been believing ♫</i>

378
00:26:03,150 --> 00:26:04,425
<i>♫ that miracles can happen ♫</i>

379
00:26:04,425 --> 00:26:06,900
<i>♫ I don't care what other people think ♫</i>

380
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,113
<i>♫ Suspicion is mounting ♫</i>

381
00:26:08,113 --> 00:26:09,915
<i>No matter how much you like him</i>

382
00:26:09,915 --> 00:26:10,582
<i>♫ What love will be like ♫</i>

383
00:26:10,582 --> 00:26:11,283
<i>and how hard you try,</i>

384
00:26:11,283 --> 00:26:13,352
<i>he doesn't love you.</i>

385
00:26:13,352 --> 00:26:14,830
<i>♫ What love should be like ♫</i>

386
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:17,255
<i>The only person who loves you is me.</i>
