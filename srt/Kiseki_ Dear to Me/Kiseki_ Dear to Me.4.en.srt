18
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:53,782
(Stop thinking of it, Bai Zongyi.)

19
00:01:55,817 --> 00:01:57,752
(You have more important things to do.)

20
00:02:36,655 --> 00:02:41,496
(Job Vacancy)

21
00:02:41,496 --> 00:02:42,397
Hi.

22
00:02:42,797 --> 00:02:44,232
I'd like to work part-time here.

23
00:02:48,703 --> 00:02:49,938
(I'll get used to it eventually.)

24
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:52,741
(Life as it used to be,)

25
00:02:53,608 --> 00:02:55,377
(living alone.)

26
00:03:27,809 --> 00:03:29,444
Can I help you?

27
00:03:30,512 --> 00:03:31,346
It's okay.

28
00:03:31,346 --> 00:03:32,514
I'm just browsing.

29
00:03:44,593 --> 00:03:46,127
Should I buy the birthday cake?

30
00:03:46,728 --> 00:03:48,463
Even though the person
stood me up three times.

31
00:03:49,731 --> 00:03:51,800
I don't know.

32
00:03:53,435 --> 00:03:54,236
Let me handle this.

33
00:03:55,036 --> 00:03:56,238
Hi, may I...

34
00:03:56,238 --> 00:03:57,739
My birthday is on the same day as his.

35
00:03:59,541 --> 00:04:00,008
What a coincidence.

36
00:04:00,008 --> 00:04:01,710
But that's not our real birthday.

37
00:04:06,081 --> 00:04:07,649
My parents passed away early.

38
00:04:07,649 --> 00:04:09,284
His parents passed away early too.

39
00:04:09,284 --> 00:04:10,385
So our birthday was randomly decided

40
00:04:10,385 --> 00:04:12,254
by our adoptive parents.

41
00:04:12,254 --> 00:04:13,021
We promised each other

42
00:04:13,021 --> 00:04:14,122
if we're both still alive

43
00:04:14,122 --> 00:04:14,956
at this of time every year,

44
00:04:14,956 --> 00:04:16,424
we would celebrate
our birthdays together.

45
00:04:20,228 --> 00:04:21,229
I even bought the present already.

46
00:04:22,497 --> 00:04:23,665
I don't know what happened

47
00:04:23,665 --> 00:04:25,000
between you and your friend,

48
00:04:26,101 --> 00:04:27,769
but celebrating your birthday

49
00:04:27,769 --> 00:04:29,571
with people you like
will make you extra happy.

50
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:33,208
Someone has to make the first move,
right?

51
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:56,765
Yes, Boss.

52
00:04:57,198 --> 00:04:57,799
I thought you were too busy

53
00:04:57,799 --> 00:04:59,301
to remember that it's my birthday today.

54
00:04:59,301 --> 00:04:59,968
Chen Yi.

55
00:04:59,968 --> 00:05:01,036
And Ai Di's too.

56
00:05:03,004 --> 00:05:03,872
Let me ask him.

57
00:05:04,773 --> 00:05:05,840
Boss wants to celebrate our birthday.

58
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:06,808
Do you want to come?

59
00:05:10,745 --> 00:05:11,546
I'm busy.

60
00:05:13,415 --> 00:05:14,449
He's busy.

61
00:05:15,383 --> 00:05:16,418
I'll be right there.

62
00:05:32,901 --> 00:05:34,235
The fourth time now.

63
00:05:35,937 --> 00:05:37,272
I'm such an idiot.

64
00:05:44,646 --> 00:05:45,947
Happy birthday.

65
00:06:33,094 --> 00:06:34,829
You already celebrated
your birthday with Chen Yi?

66
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:36,865
Yes.

67
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:46,775
And he went to see Boss?

68
00:06:59,487 --> 00:07:00,355
Happy birthday.

69
00:07:13,201 --> 00:07:14,903
What's so good about Chen Yi?

70
00:07:17,972 --> 00:07:19,240
I don't know.

71
00:07:24,979 --> 00:07:27,348
He was the first one to find out
that I was seriously sick.

72
00:07:28,516 --> 00:07:30,018
He looked after me.

73
00:07:31,252 --> 00:07:32,587
We grew up together.

74
00:07:33,721 --> 00:07:36,191
He is naggy. He scolds me.

75
00:07:39,494 --> 00:07:41,029
(But he cares for me.)

76
00:07:45,834 --> 00:07:47,602
I like him a lot. All right?

77
00:07:48,336 --> 00:07:49,571
So much so that I would die

78
00:07:51,306 --> 00:07:52,807
for him.

79
00:07:54,642 --> 00:07:56,177
I mean it.

80
00:07:56,978 --> 00:07:58,213
You're exaggerating it.

81
00:07:59,781 --> 00:08:01,316
You won't get it anyway, idiot.

82
00:08:02,817 --> 00:08:04,118
Some people

83
00:08:04,118 --> 00:08:05,019
are worth

84
00:08:05,019 --> 00:08:06,488
dying for.

85
00:08:08,323 --> 00:08:09,691
You'll know when you find the right one.

86
00:08:43,855 --> 00:08:51,080
(February, 2019)

87
00:08:52,433 --> 00:08:53,701
(Listen up, everyone.)

88
00:08:54,502 --> 00:08:55,737
The winter break is over.

89
00:08:55,737 --> 00:08:57,539
Focus on your studies now.

90
00:08:57,539 --> 00:08:59,340
Quiet down. Listen to me.

91
00:08:59,741 --> 00:09:00,975
It's time to think about

92
00:09:00,975 --> 00:09:02,443
your university choice.

93
00:09:02,443 --> 00:09:03,511
Also, Mr. Zhang slipped

94
00:09:03,511 --> 00:09:04,445
and fell in his shower.

95
00:09:04,445 --> 00:09:05,947
He broke his leg

96
00:09:06,614 --> 00:09:08,082
and will need
to stay at home to recover.

97
00:09:08,082 --> 00:09:09,350
Therefore, Mr. Gao will be

98
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:10,318
your substitute teacher.

99
00:09:10,318 --> 00:09:11,920
Let's welcome him.

100
00:09:21,629 --> 00:09:23,231
(Are you kidding me?)

101
00:09:24,599 --> 00:09:26,768
Zhang Teng is selling drugs
to the students?

102
00:09:27,068 --> 00:09:29,437
The man we caught confessed
that the dealings were underway.

103
00:09:30,905 --> 00:09:32,340
Unless the dealer has enough stock,

104
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:33,875
he will get in touch with Zhang Teng.

105
00:09:34,409 --> 00:09:35,243
I have talked

106
00:09:35,243 --> 00:09:36,644
to the principal.

107
00:09:36,644 --> 00:09:38,212
He wants to contain the scandal

108
00:09:38,212 --> 00:09:39,247
to protect the school's reputation.

109
00:09:40,014 --> 00:09:40,615
He will cooperate with us

110
00:09:40,615 --> 00:09:42,550
and let our guys in
for the investigation.

111
00:09:44,385 --> 00:09:45,420
That's good.

112
00:09:45,954 --> 00:09:46,888
We need someone

113
00:09:46,888 --> 00:09:48,523
who can go unnoticed

114
00:09:48,523 --> 00:09:50,158
and can approach students easily.

115
00:09:50,558 --> 00:09:51,859
Like a teacher.

116
00:09:58,933 --> 00:10:00,034
Why are you looking at me?

117
00:10:02,103 --> 00:10:04,339
(Gao Renyou)
My name is Gao Renyou.

118
00:10:04,339 --> 00:10:06,240
I will be teaching you maths
this semester.

119
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,742
Mr. Zhang told me

120
00:10:07,742 --> 00:10:09,811
to work on your calculus.

121
00:10:09,811 --> 00:10:11,245
I know some of you are not taking AST.

122
00:10:11,245 --> 00:10:12,347
But some are.

123
00:10:12,347 --> 00:10:13,581
Let's not disturb them.

124
00:10:13,581 --> 00:10:15,683
Now, turn to page three
of your maths handout.

125
00:10:29,964 --> 00:10:31,199
Why are you here?

126
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:34,569
I see you're eager to learn calculus.

127
00:10:35,336 --> 00:10:36,838
Let's talk in my office.

128
00:10:44,078 --> 00:10:46,047
Pretend that you don't know me, okay?

129
00:10:46,648 --> 00:10:47,682
Who are you?

130
00:10:47,682 --> 00:10:49,283
Why did you pretend to be a teacher
and come to my school?

131
00:10:49,283 --> 00:10:50,084
Who let you in?

132
00:10:50,685 --> 00:10:52,754
It's my business. Stay out of it.

133
00:10:54,622 --> 00:10:56,090
Explain the money then.

134
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:57,925
You left me a sum,
then I need to know the reason.

135
00:10:58,459 --> 00:11:00,728
As I said, it's a thank-you gift.

136
00:11:00,728 --> 00:11:01,829
You should stop working part-time now.

137
00:11:01,829 --> 00:11:03,097
Focus on the examination.

138
00:11:03,398 --> 00:11:05,433
That's my business.
Don't tell me what to do.

139
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,135
Quit being unreasonable.

140
00:11:07,535 --> 00:11:08,369
Me? Unreasonable?

141
00:11:08,369 --> 00:11:09,303
You forced me to help you.

142
00:11:09,303 --> 00:11:10,638
Then, you left a sum and disappeared.

143
00:11:10,638 --> 00:11:12,607
You came and left without a word.

144
00:11:12,974 --> 00:11:14,575
Now, you want me to pretend
like we never met.

145
00:11:14,575 --> 00:11:15,610
You are the unreasonable one.

146
00:11:18,713 --> 00:11:19,914
And if he is seen hanging out with us,

147
00:11:19,914 --> 00:11:20,848
he'll be in trouble.

148
00:11:23,985 --> 00:11:25,953
And if your family knows,
we'll be done for.

149
00:11:26,521 --> 00:11:27,722
In a nasty way.

150
00:11:32,126 --> 00:11:33,995
You're not my friend, kiddo.

151
00:11:34,462 --> 00:11:35,730
You were just there at the right time.

152
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:36,964
Otherwise, I wouldn't have turned
to a kid for help.

153
00:11:37,331 --> 00:11:38,566
You can't even cook.

154
00:11:41,235 --> 00:11:43,337
From now on, we are strangers.

155
00:11:43,337 --> 00:11:44,172
I will just let you bleed

156
00:11:44,172 --> 00:11:45,473
to death next time.

157
00:11:45,473 --> 00:11:46,441
Go to hell.

158
00:12:00,188 --> 00:12:00,621
(Here we go.)

159
00:12:00,621 --> 00:12:02,457
(Ladies and gentlemen.)

160
00:12:02,457 --> 00:12:04,759
Let's see. Who is the king?

161
00:12:04,759 --> 00:12:05,993
Try your luck.

162
00:12:13,601 --> 00:12:14,635
One.

163
00:12:14,635 --> 00:12:15,636
Two.

164
00:12:15,636 --> 00:12:16,404
Three.

165
00:12:17,438 --> 00:12:19,273
Who is the king?

166
00:12:19,974 --> 00:12:22,009
You're the king.

167
00:12:22,577 --> 00:12:23,845
The king

168
00:12:23,845 --> 00:12:25,913
asks for three and six.

169
00:12:25,913 --> 00:12:26,814
Yes!

170
00:12:27,248 --> 00:12:28,883
Me again?

171
00:12:30,818 --> 00:12:32,487
The king

172
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:34,155
throws the dice!

173
00:12:36,557 --> 00:12:39,560
Belly button kiss.

174
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:40,795
Come on, baby.

175
00:12:40,795 --> 00:12:42,396
Belly button kiss.

176
00:12:42,396 --> 00:12:43,231
Come.

177
00:12:43,231 --> 00:12:44,999
Come on, baby.

178
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:50,371
Are you ready?

179
00:12:50,371 --> 00:12:51,672
I am ready.

180
00:12:55,476 --> 00:12:56,410
What the heck?

181
00:12:56,410 --> 00:12:57,311
You...

182
00:12:57,311 --> 00:12:57,979
Mr. Yi, you...

183
00:12:59,514 --> 00:13:00,615
Hey!

184
00:13:04,418 --> 00:13:05,386
We were having fun.

185
00:13:05,386 --> 00:13:06,854
Don't ruin it.

186
00:13:07,421 --> 00:13:08,990
You had too much fun
and threw caution to the wind.

187
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:10,491
Alongside your men too.

188
00:13:10,491 --> 00:13:11,659
Take care of yourself.

189
00:13:12,593 --> 00:13:14,228
We're thugs. We live in the moment.

190
00:13:14,595 --> 00:13:15,563
God knows when one bullet finds its way

191
00:13:15,563 --> 00:13:17,031
to our brains one day.

192
00:13:17,365 --> 00:13:18,399
Stay out of my business.

193
00:13:24,739 --> 00:13:26,073
Well, you're my business.

194
00:13:27,942 --> 00:13:29,177
You're nosy.

195
00:13:30,311 --> 00:13:31,646
We're buddies.

196
00:13:31,646 --> 00:13:32,380
Looking after you is my duty.

197
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:33,447
No need.

198
00:13:34,282 --> 00:13:35,183
If you're that bored,

199
00:13:35,183 --> 00:13:36,450
go out and catch Zhang Teng.

200
00:13:37,685 --> 00:13:39,654
Or you can head back to headquarters
to visit Boss.

201
00:13:40,388 --> 00:13:41,923
Maybe he'll notice your feelings

202
00:13:41,923 --> 00:13:43,457
and become your boo.

203
00:13:43,457 --> 00:13:44,192
Romantic, isn't it?

204
00:13:44,192 --> 00:13:44,926
Why do you always

205
00:13:44,926 --> 00:13:46,194
use that to spite me?

206
00:13:50,765 --> 00:13:51,799
Because I enjoy it.

207
00:13:54,435 --> 00:13:55,736
We agreed that I would run the bar.

208
00:13:55,736 --> 00:13:56,904
But you come here often
to boss me around.

209
00:13:56,904 --> 00:13:58,105
How will the people under me
view me now?

210
00:13:59,674 --> 00:14:01,042
Use your brain.

211
00:14:03,778 --> 00:14:04,579
Whatever.

212
00:14:06,681 --> 00:14:07,748
Hey.

213
00:14:07,748 --> 00:14:08,349
Chen Yi.

214
00:14:10,184 --> 00:14:11,052
Chen Yi!

215
00:14:13,921 --> 00:14:15,456
Tell me to my face if you're a man.

216
00:14:17,325 --> 00:14:18,192
Chen Yi!

217
00:14:21,195 --> 00:14:22,163
You jerk.

218
00:14:33,941 --> 00:14:34,976
Idiot.

219
00:14:36,177 --> 00:14:38,246
Do you think I don't know who you like?

220
00:14:41,949 --> 00:14:43,484
They will cut off the water supply soon.

221
00:14:43,751 --> 00:14:45,353
Let's call it a day here.

222
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:13,714
Bai Jingyu.

223
00:15:13,714 --> 00:15:15,816
Why are you calling me
at this late hour?

224
00:15:16,183 --> 00:15:18,653
I miss you. Is that a problem?

225
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:19,887
What are you doing?

226
00:15:21,522 --> 00:15:22,390
Studying.

227
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:23,324
What else?

228
00:15:24,258 --> 00:15:25,660
How is Dad?

229
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:27,662
Tell him to obey the doctor's order.

230
00:15:27,862 --> 00:15:29,764
I will.

231
00:15:29,764 --> 00:15:31,999
You nag me all the time.

232
00:15:33,567 --> 00:15:34,702
When are you coming back?

233
00:15:35,236 --> 00:15:37,004
I'll come back once I know
which university accepts me.

234
00:15:37,338 --> 00:15:38,139
For real?

235
00:15:38,406 --> 00:15:39,640
Yes, I'm serious.

236
00:15:39,941 --> 00:15:41,142
Bai Zongyi.

237
00:15:41,142 --> 00:15:43,344
All right. Study hard. Make Dad proud.

238
00:15:43,344 --> 00:15:44,078
Bye.

239
00:15:45,446 --> 00:15:46,781
Nagging me again.

240
00:15:47,548 --> 00:15:48,916
I hate how he's the smart one
between us.

241
00:16:24,185 --> 00:16:26,988
You again? What a coincidence.

242
00:16:28,556 --> 00:16:29,857
Kiddo.

243
00:16:46,574 --> 00:16:48,309
You stink.

244
00:16:50,378 --> 00:16:51,779
Go shower.

245
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:56,984
I'm hungry.

246
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:44,465
It'll taste better with an egg.

247
00:17:51,138 --> 00:17:52,406
This cake...

248
00:17:52,755 --> 00:17:54,955
(Manufacture Date: December 20, 2018,
Consume within three days)

249
00:17:55,743 --> 00:17:56,777
It's for me.

250
00:17:57,878 --> 00:17:59,246
It has been expired for a long time.

251
00:17:59,713 --> 00:18:01,082
It's none of your business.

252
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:04,151
The congee is done.
After you eat, bugger off.

253
00:18:41,021 --> 00:18:42,123
What's so funny?

254
00:18:43,224 --> 00:18:45,025
This is such a challenge here.

255
00:18:57,638 --> 00:18:58,873
I have a sweet tooth

256
00:18:58,873 --> 00:18:59,840
but this is...

257
00:19:00,875 --> 00:19:02,109
Forget it. I'll get a takeout.

258
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:07,581
Grab another spoon.

259
00:19:08,149 --> 00:19:08,916
What for?

260
00:19:09,817 --> 00:19:10,985
We're sharing this burden together.

261
00:19:11,252 --> 00:19:12,620
Unless you want to use my spoon too?

262
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:13,621
I don't mind.

263
00:19:14,555 --> 00:19:15,789
I'll throw it away.

264
00:19:15,789 --> 00:19:17,124
I know you.

265
00:19:18,626 --> 00:19:20,494
You don't want to waste it

266
00:19:20,494 --> 00:19:21,996
so you'll finish it yourself.

267
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:26,967
Let's share it

268
00:19:27,234 --> 00:19:27,801
together.

269
00:19:27,801 --> 00:19:29,403
I screwed up.

270
00:19:29,837 --> 00:19:31,572
But you cooked for me.

271
00:19:33,807 --> 00:19:35,109
I had a huge spoonful just now

272
00:19:35,676 --> 00:19:37,244
so you should do the same.
Just to be fair.

273
00:19:44,351 --> 00:19:45,019
All right.

274
00:19:49,924 --> 00:19:51,258
Disgusting, right?

275
00:19:59,066 --> 00:20:00,901
Your turn now. Don't chicken out.

276
00:20:01,402 --> 00:20:02,636
I won't chicken out.

277
00:20:18,786 --> 00:20:19,620
Your change.

278
00:20:33,767 --> 00:20:34,768
I noted down all the fees on my phone.

279
00:20:34,768 --> 00:20:35,769
Feel free to cross-check them.

280
00:20:37,771 --> 00:20:38,772
Just keep the money.

281
00:20:38,772 --> 00:20:39,607
You might need it

282
00:20:39,607 --> 00:20:40,207
in case of...

283
00:20:40,207 --> 00:20:41,809
It's not my money. I won't use it.

284
00:20:55,289 --> 00:20:55,756
Okay. Okay.

285
00:20:55,756 --> 00:20:57,024
I know you have your principles.

286
00:20:58,092 --> 00:20:59,159
Eat it.

287
00:21:00,127 --> 00:21:01,695
It's going to be more disgusting
once it's cold.

288
00:21:09,336 --> 00:21:10,537
It's burnt

289
00:21:10,971 --> 00:21:12,206
and bitter.

290
00:21:12,373 --> 00:21:13,440
No, it isn't.

291
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,375
Try it.

292
00:21:19,413 --> 00:21:20,281
Okay, I admit.

293
00:21:20,281 --> 00:21:21,548
You are the worst chef

294
00:21:21,548 --> 00:21:22,383
ever.

295
00:21:22,383 --> 00:21:23,517
The pot called the kettle black.

296
00:21:23,517 --> 00:21:24,652
What?

297
00:21:24,652 --> 00:21:26,086
I am a great cook.

298
00:21:27,021 --> 00:21:29,356
You can't even tell sugar
and salt apart.

299
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:30,557
Both are white.

300
00:21:32,126 --> 00:21:33,294
Eat it.

301
00:21:33,627 --> 00:21:35,095
Do we really have to finish it?

302
00:21:35,095 --> 00:21:36,630
Do you have it in you to throw it away?

303
00:21:37,398 --> 00:21:38,232
Fine.

304
00:21:44,338 --> 00:21:47,074
This is so hard to swallow.

305
00:21:54,548 --> 00:21:55,416
Let me do the dishes.

306
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:57,951
I was cooking.
So I should wash the dishes.

307
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,288
You cook. I wash the dishes.
We're even now.

308
00:22:01,288 --> 00:22:02,790
And don't worry,
I'll leave once I'm done.

309
00:22:04,458 --> 00:22:05,392
What about the beer?

310
00:22:09,330 --> 00:22:10,798
The beer in the fridge?

311
00:22:10,798 --> 00:22:11,665
I'm underage so I can't drink.

312
00:22:11,665 --> 00:22:12,633
You need to finish them.

313
00:22:16,303 --> 00:22:17,338
Sure.

314
00:22:52,039 --> 00:22:54,074
Your family
has high expectations of you?

315
00:22:55,442 --> 00:22:57,277
Not really. It's just me.

316
00:22:57,277 --> 00:22:58,679
I aspire to be a doctor.

317
00:22:58,679 --> 00:22:59,980
A rich doctor.

318
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:01,982
Are you going to a public university?

319
00:23:01,982 --> 00:23:03,998
Students on government scholarships
are required to serve in remote areas

320
00:23:03,998 --> 00:23:04,385
for ten years.

321
00:23:04,385 --> 00:23:05,619
They won't earn much.

322
00:23:07,821 --> 00:23:09,056
I see.

323
00:23:10,958 --> 00:23:12,025
Good luck.

324
00:23:43,323 --> 00:23:43,824
I should...

325
00:23:43,824 --> 00:23:44,892
Five more cans left.

326
00:23:45,626 --> 00:23:46,493
I'll grab them.

327
00:24:00,674 --> 00:24:02,075
