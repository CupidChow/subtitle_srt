18
00:01:21,816 --> 00:01:22,917
You done?

19
00:01:22,917 --> 00:01:23,518
Let's go.

20
00:01:24,685 --> 00:01:26,087
Bye, mister.

21
00:01:26,087 --> 00:01:26,954
Come again!

22
00:01:55,383 --> 00:01:56,617
You can't wash dishes

23
00:01:56,617 --> 00:01:57,985
with telepathy.

24
00:02:00,388 --> 00:02:01,722
Sorry.

25
00:02:21,476 --> 00:02:22,243
(But this is what)

26
00:02:22,243 --> 00:02:24,112
(you make me feel.)

27
00:02:24,112 --> 00:02:24,812
If being a man

28
00:02:24,812 --> 00:02:25,713
means you can kiss anyone

29
00:02:25,713 --> 00:02:26,948
and hold a cavalier attitude,

30
00:02:26,948 --> 00:02:27,982
I don't need it!

31
00:02:27,982 --> 00:02:29,984
Not everyone is as frivolous as you.

32
00:02:51,839 --> 00:02:54,976
(When are you coming back?)

33
00:03:09,357 --> 00:03:10,258
Yes?

34
00:03:10,858 --> 00:03:12,293
If someone pisses you off,

35
00:03:12,293 --> 00:03:13,861
what does he need to do to pacify you?

36
00:03:14,362 --> 00:03:15,657
Those who piss me off

37
00:03:15,657 --> 00:03:17,298
won't live to see another day.

38
00:03:17,298 --> 00:03:18,332
Mercy, Ai Di.

39
00:03:18,332 --> 00:03:20,868
I truly have no idea, Ai Di!

40
00:03:20,868 --> 00:03:22,803
Please let me go, Ai Di!

41
00:03:22,803 --> 00:03:24,030
Right. I shouldn't have come to you.

42
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:25,606
You two are around the same age,
but the similarity ends there.

43
00:03:25,606 --> 00:03:27,175
- What?
- Ai Di!

44
00:03:27,642 --> 00:03:28,509
Nothing.

45
00:03:28,509 --> 00:03:29,443
Bye.

46
00:03:29,443 --> 00:03:30,178
Hello?

47
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:33,648
Rui? What did you say?

48
00:03:35,116 --> 00:03:36,017
Fan Zherui?

49
00:03:36,017 --> 00:03:37,151
He hung up on me.

50
00:03:38,853 --> 00:03:40,154
He asked me some weird questions.

51
00:03:40,555 --> 00:03:41,989
How long does he have to stay in hiding?

52
00:03:42,456 --> 00:03:43,424
Until

53
00:03:43,424 --> 00:03:44,759
we find Zhang Teng.

54
00:03:46,027 --> 00:03:47,061
Has he confessed?

55
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:50,831
He has.

56
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:52,033
But when our men went there,

57
00:03:52,033 --> 00:03:53,501
there was nobody,

58
00:03:53,501 --> 00:03:54,702
just like the previous time.

59
00:03:55,403 --> 00:03:56,537
They are like a bunch of rats.

60
00:03:56,537 --> 00:03:57,405
So good at hiding.

61
00:03:59,173 --> 00:04:00,441
Unless...

62
00:04:00,441 --> 00:04:01,776
You lied to me?

63
00:04:01,776 --> 00:04:03,311
I know nothing.

64
00:04:03,311 --> 00:04:05,179
Please let me go!

65
00:04:06,113 --> 00:04:07,481
Let me go!

66
00:04:08,216 --> 00:04:09,584
Help!

67
00:04:10,184 --> 00:04:11,786
I know nothing!

68
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:17,925
Cut it out!

69
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:34,108
I am sick of your silent treatment.

70
00:04:38,145 --> 00:04:39,313
I am angry.

71
00:04:39,313 --> 00:04:40,448
Very angry.

72
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:43,551
What do you want?
Do you want to fight?

73
00:04:44,051 --> 00:04:45,086
Can you even defeat me?

74
00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:58,132
Are you going to feed me if I can't
charm anyone for money with my face?

75
00:04:58,132 --> 00:04:59,300
Why didn't you dodge?

76
00:05:00,968 --> 00:05:03,070
I don't know what else to do
to show my sincerity.

77
00:05:03,671 --> 00:05:04,839
You're right.

78
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:06,974
Not everyone is as frivolous as me.

79
00:05:08,042 --> 00:05:10,177
I shouldn't have made fun
of your belief.

80
00:05:10,911 --> 00:05:12,280
So you let me punch you?

81
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,815
I have to use my body
to ask for your forgiveness.

82
00:05:15,383 --> 00:05:16,317
Hit me.

83
00:05:16,317 --> 00:05:17,385
But not the face.

84
00:05:19,453 --> 00:05:20,288
I'll punch you then.

85
00:05:20,588 --> 00:05:21,489
Bring it on.

86
00:05:21,889 --> 00:05:22,923
I'll punch you real hard.

87
00:05:22,923 --> 00:05:24,959
Hurry up. Be a man and get it over with.

88
00:05:27,895 --> 00:05:28,896
You're serious.

89
00:05:29,497 --> 00:05:31,032
You asked for it.

90
00:05:34,168 --> 00:05:34,969
Are you still mad?

91
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:36,537
Three more punches.

92
00:05:36,804 --> 00:05:37,405
You're enjoying it now.

93
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:40,041
Stop.

94
00:05:40,041 --> 00:05:40,841
My turn now.

95
00:06:03,898 --> 00:06:04,632
Bai Zongyi.

96
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:06,300
Thanks.

97
00:06:07,435 --> 00:06:08,569
You're in a good mood today.

98
00:06:08,569 --> 00:06:09,837
Did you put the cat up for adoption?

99
00:06:09,837 --> 00:06:11,172
No.

100
00:06:11,172 --> 00:06:13,074
So you mend your relationship
with your cat.

101
00:06:15,009 --> 00:06:15,943
I guess so.

102
00:06:16,711 --> 00:06:18,612
Your math notes are so useful.

103
00:06:18,612 --> 00:06:19,747
And the formulas rhyme too.

104
00:06:20,047 --> 00:06:20,981
I wrote a song about it.

105
00:06:20,981 --> 00:06:21,816
Do you want to listen?

106
00:06:21,816 --> 00:06:22,416
Sure.

107
00:06:22,416 --> 00:06:23,084
Here I go.

108
00:06:23,584 --> 00:06:25,152
♪Sin is always equal to one♪

109
00:06:25,152 --> 00:06:26,487
♪Sin squared and cos squared

110
00:06:26,487 --> 00:06:27,855

♪Don't forget who taught you this.

113
00:06:31,659 --> 00:06:32,259
Not bad, right?

114
00:06:32,259 --> 00:06:33,094
Indeed.

115
00:06:33,594 --> 00:06:34,895
Then get 75 on the math exam

116
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:36,130
and make your grandmother proud.

117
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:37,932
I wish I could.

118
00:06:38,599 --> 00:06:40,267
If I do get a 75 on the math exam,

119
00:06:40,267 --> 00:06:42,236
I'll ask my grandma
to make you something.

120
00:06:42,236 --> 00:06:43,571
She's a good cook, I tell you.

121
00:06:43,571 --> 00:06:45,072
And she's on a dessert spree lately.

122
00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:46,607
Then why are you getting
charity meals every day?

123
00:06:47,108 --> 00:06:47,908
Well...

124
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:49,777
Because all the cute girls work there.

125
00:06:50,478 --> 00:06:52,680
Fang Zi'an. You're sneaky.

126
00:07:00,454 --> 00:07:01,856
Anyway, can your grandmother
bake me a cake?

127
00:07:02,223 --> 00:07:02,890
Sure.

128
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:03,691
A strawberry cake.

129
00:07:03,691 --> 00:07:04,425
No problem.

130
00:07:04,425 --> 00:07:05,226
Thanks.

131
00:07:15,736 --> 00:07:18,172
He asked for you.
Why did you bring me here too?

132
00:07:18,973 --> 00:07:20,474
Because you will come here anyway.

133
00:07:37,691 --> 00:07:40,060
Does he have a lot of free time?

134
00:07:40,995 --> 00:07:42,797
He even has the time to visit
a hot spring this early.

135
00:07:43,464 --> 00:07:44,799
But we have things to do, all right?

136
00:08:06,187 --> 00:08:06,921
Boss?

137
00:08:07,254 --> 00:08:08,489
You might as well call me Daddy.

138
00:08:08,489 --> 00:08:10,958
You think the headquarters
is your safe space now?

139
00:08:11,659 --> 00:08:13,294
Don't let your guard down.

140
00:08:37,284 --> 00:08:38,853
You raided Zhang Teng's territory.

141
00:08:39,453 --> 00:08:41,155
Why didn't you tell us prior?

142
00:08:44,925 --> 00:08:47,261
He made a ruckus in my territory,
so it is my business.

143
00:08:47,728 --> 00:08:49,763
It has nothing to do
with the headquarters.

144
00:08:49,763 --> 00:08:51,632
Zhang Teng is part of the Dragon Gang.

145
00:08:51,932 --> 00:08:53,968
We were trying to eliminate them.

146
00:08:53,968 --> 00:08:55,936
But thanks to you,
they are on high alert now.

147
00:08:56,403 --> 00:08:58,172
Whose fault is it now?

148
00:08:58,172 --> 00:08:59,573
In the end, it's still Boss

149
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:00,941
who cleans up after your mess.

150
00:09:01,542 --> 00:09:02,376
I have a plan.

151
00:09:02,376 --> 00:09:03,878
Your plan

152
00:09:03,878 --> 00:09:06,146
cost seven of our men
and injured 13 more.

153
00:09:06,847 --> 00:09:08,516
Fan Zherui also went missing.

154
00:09:10,784 --> 00:09:11,919
Enough, Minglei.

155
00:09:12,686 --> 00:09:14,788
The younger generation

156
00:09:14,788 --> 00:09:16,323
is often impetuous.

157
00:09:18,392 --> 00:09:19,627
Don't do this again.

158
00:09:20,027 --> 00:09:21,095
You hear me?

159
00:09:23,764 --> 00:09:24,732
Yes, sir.

160
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:28,536
A reunion? Boss.

161
00:09:28,536 --> 00:09:29,870
Shuo, give me the phone.

162
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:31,472
I want to capture this touching moment

163
00:09:31,472 --> 00:09:32,239
and bring it to Japan.

164
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:33,941
Reunion, my foot.

165
00:09:33,941 --> 00:09:36,477
No one brings their phone
to a hot spring.

166
00:09:37,878 --> 00:09:38,779
Right.

167
00:09:41,215 --> 00:09:42,016
Whatever.

168
00:09:49,023 --> 00:09:50,024
Shouldn't you greet him?

169
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:52,626
Mr. Xian, Mr. Shuo.

170
00:09:52,626 --> 00:09:53,527
Good boy.

171
00:09:54,995 --> 00:09:57,164
You two are going to Japan?

172
00:09:57,164 --> 00:09:58,065
Yes.

173
00:09:58,065 --> 00:09:59,266
After this,

174
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,668
let's eat together.

175
00:10:02,836 --> 00:10:04,171
Your last meal.

176
00:10:04,171 --> 00:10:05,806
Don't jinx it, Boss.

177
00:10:05,806 --> 00:10:07,374
We wouldn't want a plane crash.

178
00:10:09,843 --> 00:10:11,445
You're jinxing it too.

179
00:10:16,617 --> 00:10:17,518
You're coming too.

180
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:50,417
Thanks, Boss.

181
00:10:50,417 --> 00:10:51,318
We should go now.

182
00:10:53,554 --> 00:10:54,922
You should have stayed.

183
00:10:54,922 --> 00:10:56,490
That way,
you can spend the night with him.

184
00:10:56,857 --> 00:10:58,392
You two can sit in the hot spring

185
00:10:58,392 --> 00:11:00,427
until your skin melts away.

186
00:11:00,427 --> 00:11:01,395
Shut up.

187
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:04,198
Stay out of my business.

188
00:11:04,965 --> 00:11:06,033
Fine.

189
00:11:07,868 --> 00:11:09,169
They only gave us one month

190
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:10,938
to deal with Zhang Teng.

191
00:11:11,405 --> 00:11:12,439
What do we do now?

192
00:11:17,378 --> 00:11:18,278
Hey!

193
00:11:21,615 --> 00:11:22,883
Are you sure

194
00:11:24,151 --> 00:11:25,686
they can deal with Zhang Teng?

195
00:11:25,686 --> 00:11:27,021
Why not?

196
00:11:27,021 --> 00:11:28,122
When we were 17,

197
00:11:28,122 --> 00:11:28,455
we already

198
00:11:28,455 --> 00:11:30,157
claimed many lives with our hands.

199
00:11:30,658 --> 00:11:31,659
Right, Boss?

200
00:11:31,659 --> 00:11:32,960
Yeah, right.

201
00:11:33,494 --> 00:11:35,763
It seems like your age
hasn't curbed your temper at all.

202
00:11:36,563 --> 00:11:37,731
Do you want to be stabbed again?

203
00:11:38,599 --> 00:11:40,968
Does the scar on your tummy

204
00:11:41,301 --> 00:11:42,202
not teach you anything?

205
00:11:45,506 --> 00:11:47,074
I'll look after Xian, Boss.

206
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:50,611
I don't even know if it's the right call

207
00:11:50,611 --> 00:11:52,079
to let you handle our business in Japan.

208
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:57,084
We can do it.

209
00:11:57,084 --> 00:11:58,419
Trust us, Boss.

210
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:03,991
It's getting late.

211
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:05,659
We have to head to the airport.

212
00:12:06,093 --> 00:12:06,760
We do?

213
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,062
- Let's go.
- Can't we stay?

214
00:12:08,362 --> 00:12:09,163
Seriously?

215
00:12:09,763 --> 00:12:10,798
I barely sat down.

216
00:12:10,798 --> 00:12:11,398
Come on.

217
00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:13,200
Wait, I haven't even finished the tea.

218
00:12:14,635 --> 00:12:15,869
Only Shuo

219
00:12:15,869 --> 00:12:17,371
can reign Xian in.

220
00:12:20,941 --> 00:12:21,842
Relax.

221
00:12:21,842 --> 00:12:23,043
Xian is temperamental,

222
00:12:23,544 --> 00:12:25,079
but he knows what's off-limit.

223
00:12:25,746 --> 00:12:26,947
Chen Yi's stupid trick

224
00:12:27,214 --> 00:12:28,749
put the Dragon Gang on high alert.

225
00:12:29,683 --> 00:12:31,185
They are now transferring
their assets away.

226
00:12:32,686 --> 00:12:34,321
The trap I set up, the leads I have,

227
00:12:35,222 --> 00:12:36,223
all went down the drain.

228
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:40,794
If you did it once,

229
00:12:41,595 --> 00:12:43,197
you can do it again.

230
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:45,432
I have faith in you.

231
00:12:48,001 --> 00:12:49,603
You trapped me with that "faith"

232
00:12:50,771 --> 00:12:52,272
for more than twenty years now.

233
00:12:55,509 --> 00:12:56,510
Do you think

234
00:12:57,211 --> 00:12:58,479
I'll believe you this time?

235
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,782
You're trapped
for more than twenty years.

236
00:13:02,716 --> 00:13:04,118
Adding another year is nothing.

237
00:13:05,953 --> 00:13:06,954
This is the last time.

238
00:13:11,358 --> 00:13:12,659
I promise.

239
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:45,650
(FS Bank, Bai Zongyi)

240
00:13:49,096 --> 00:13:51,098
Look, if I were a thief,
I would be a picky one.

241
00:13:51,098 --> 00:13:53,033
And I would never steal
from someone like you.

242
00:14:02,843 --> 00:14:03,811
Biology.

243
00:14:10,384 --> 00:14:11,618
So thorough.

244
00:14:11,618 --> 00:14:13,153
It's as if he swallowed the whole book.

245
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:24,210
(Strawberry Cake)

246
00:14:29,937 --> 00:14:30,804
Hello?

247
00:14:30,804 --> 00:14:32,472
Hey, you need to return now.

248
00:14:33,006 --> 00:14:34,441
The higher-up found out
that you're missing.

249
00:14:34,441 --> 00:14:35,442
It's still too soon.

250
00:14:35,442 --> 00:14:36,977
I'm enjoying my vacation now.

251
00:14:36,977 --> 00:14:38,011
It's been a while since I had a break.

252
00:14:38,412 --> 00:14:39,713
Oh? Did you find the love of your life,

253
00:14:39,713 --> 00:14:40,881
so you don't want to come back now?

254
00:14:48,622 --> 00:14:51,358
He's cute when he smiles.

255
00:14:51,358 --> 00:14:53,126
But he never smiles at me.

256
00:15:42,409 --> 00:15:43,410
Listen.

257
00:15:43,777 --> 00:15:46,413
If you don't come back,
Chen Yi and I will be screwed.

258
00:15:46,413 --> 00:15:48,448
And if your family knows,
we'll be done for.

259
00:15:48,982 --> 00:15:50,117
In a nasty way.

260
00:15:57,958 --> 00:15:59,059
Come get me this afternoon.

261
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:01,028
It's easy to sway you.

262
00:16:01,395 --> 00:16:03,730
Do it before I change my mind.

263
00:16:08,502 --> 00:16:09,703
He hung up on me again.

264
00:16:10,737 --> 00:16:12,205
I don't even know where he is.

265
00:16:14,574 --> 00:16:16,410
(Alley 48, Kangle Street,
Neihu District, Taipei City.)

266
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:17,744
(I'll be at the alley corner.)

267
00:16:29,556 --> 00:16:30,624
Boss,

268
00:16:30,924 --> 00:16:32,993
I wanted to punch him
that day in the headquarters.

269
00:16:44,671 --> 00:16:46,273
I respect you, so I did nothing.

270
00:16:48,475 --> 00:16:51,611
Captain Chen Yi,

271
00:16:51,611 --> 00:16:53,080
we found Rui.

272
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:55,415
He wants us to pick him up now.

273
00:16:55,415 --> 00:16:56,650
Otherwise,

274
00:16:56,650 --> 00:16:58,151
we won't be able to find him again.

275
00:16:58,151 --> 00:17:00,387
It can't be helped
because he's a mysterious person.

276
00:17:00,387 --> 00:17:01,154
- Noted.
- A mysterious...

277
00:17:01,154 --> 00:17:01,755
One moment, he's here.

278
00:17:01,755 --> 00:17:02,723
Noted.

279
00:17:02,723 --> 00:17:03,623
He's there now!

280
00:17:03,623 --> 00:17:04,491
But we can't see him.

281
00:17:04,491 --> 00:17:05,359
Because...

282
00:17:06,259 --> 00:17:07,394
Just because we grew up together

283
00:17:07,394 --> 00:17:08,829
doesn't mean I will let you
always have your way.

284
00:17:09,629 --> 00:17:11,431
All you can do is yell at me.

285
00:17:11,431 --> 00:17:13,066
You don't have the guts
to confess to Boss.

286
00:17:13,066 --> 00:17:13,900
You're a coward.

287
00:17:16,236 --> 00:17:17,704
What? Was I wrong?

288
00:17:18,171 --> 00:17:19,272
That day in the hot spring,

289
00:17:19,272 --> 00:17:21,041
you couldn't take your eyes off him.

290
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:22,009
You think I didn't notice?

291
00:17:22,743 --> 00:17:24,811
If you like him that much, kidnap him.

292
00:17:27,381 --> 00:17:30,050
Right. You can't beat him in a fight.

293
00:17:30,684 --> 00:17:31,985
Just wait another ten years.

294
00:17:31,985 --> 00:17:33,887
He'll be old and you'll become stronger.

295
00:17:33,887 --> 00:17:34,654
Stronger...

296
00:17:36,289 --> 00:17:37,090
Shut your mouth now.

297
00:17:39,426 --> 00:17:41,161
Oh, scary.

298
00:17:55,308 --> 00:17:56,176
Excuse me.

299
00:17:56,443 --> 00:17:58,378
Have you made your decision?

300
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:00,447
There is a queue behind you.

301
00:18:01,348 --> 00:18:02,382
Sorry.

302
00:18:04,284 --> 00:18:06,119
Is the strawberry chiffon very sweet?

303
00:18:06,119 --> 00:18:08,221
My friend is injured, so I don't want him
to have anything too sweet.

304
00:18:08,488 --> 00:18:09,256
Don't worry.

305
00:18:09,256 --> 00:18:10,957
To preserve the original flavor
of the strawberries,

306
00:18:10,957 --> 00:18:12,325
we adjusted the sweetness.

307
00:18:12,325 --> 00:18:12,926
It is not too sweet.

308
00:18:13,226 --> 00:18:15,128
You are a good friend.

309
00:18:17,964 --> 00:18:19,299
Can I have this and this?

310
00:18:20,033 --> 00:18:21,334
These two? Okay.

311
00:19:08,849 --> 00:19:10,450
Shouldn't you tell him in person?

312
00:19:11,251 --> 00:19:12,619
He saved you, after all.

313
00:19:13,854 --> 00:19:14,855
No need.

314
00:19:19,526 --> 00:19:21,161
I repaid what I owe him.

315
00:19:21,161 --> 00:19:22,496
What else is there to do?

316
00:19:22,496 --> 00:19:23,964
I won't see him again anyway.

317
00:19:23,964 --> 00:19:25,132
And if he is seen hanging out with us,

318
00:19:25,132 --> 00:19:26,433
he'll be in trouble.

319
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,368
Right.

320
00:19:28,502 --> 00:19:30,170
We live in different worlds.

321
00:19:31,605 --> 00:19:33,073
Wow, is this how the adults speak?

322
00:19:33,073 --> 00:19:34,541
So mature.

323
00:19:36,042 --> 00:19:37,344
Learn from us then.

324
00:19:47,754 --> 00:19:49,055
I'm back.

325
00:19:55,228 --> 00:19:56,363
Fan Zherui.

326
00:19:56,363 --> 00:19:58,198
I have the cake you want.

327
00:19:58,198 --> 00:19:59,232
Count yourself lucky.

328
00:19:59,232 --> 00:20:00,634
Because when I was in the shop,
it was the last one.

329
00:20:00,867 --> 00:20:02,369
I also bought another...

330
00:20:18,084 --> 00:20:19,386
(Thank you for taking care of me.)

331
00:20:19,386 --> 00:20:20,820
(As promised, your reimbursement.)

332
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,155
(Don't cry now,)

333
00:20:22,155 --> 00:20:23,523
(future doctor.)

334
00:20:38,572 --> 00:20:39,906
You could have told me earlier.

335
00:20:40,373 --> 00:20:42,042
Then, I didn't have to buy this.

336
00:20:42,042 --> 00:20:43,310
What a waste of money.

337
00:21:51,444 --> 00:21:52,279
Hi.

338
00:22:03,323 --> 00:22:04,224
What's the matter?

339
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:07,160
Nothing.

340
00:22:07,927 --> 00:22:10,196
You're beside yourself.

341
00:22:10,463 --> 00:22:11,998
You used to wash dishes

342
00:22:11,998 --> 00:22:13,266
and memorize vocabulary
at the same time.

343
00:22:14,701 --> 00:22:15,535
Disease.

344
00:22:15,769 --> 00:22:16,670
Elbow.

345
00:22:18,038 --> 00:22:18,838
A breakup?

346
00:22:19,172 --> 00:22:20,307
No.

347
00:22:20,307 --> 00:22:21,274
Then what happened?

348
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:25,078
My cat is missing.

349
00:22:25,078 --> 00:22:26,079
Your cat?

350
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:27,147
Pfft.

351
00:22:27,147 --> 00:22:28,581
It'll come back when it's hungry.

352
00:22:28,581 --> 00:22:30,016
Don't worry.

353
00:23:11,057 --> 00:23:12,025
You're back.

354
00:23:22,369 --> 00:23:23,002
Try it.

355
00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:25,772
I'm still a minor.
Besides, beer is bitter.

356
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:29,776
When it's no longer bitter,
it means you have grown up.

357
00:24:01,141 --> 00:24:02,709
(Oh? Did you find the love of your life,)

358
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:04,878
