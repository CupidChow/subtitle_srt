=KISEKI: Dear to Me=
=Episode 6=

18
00:01:21,855 --> 00:01:23,257
You won't help me wash the dishes?

19
00:01:23,757 --> 00:01:25,526
I cooked. So you do the dishes.

20
00:01:26,293 --> 00:01:28,328
Fine. You cook, I wash.

21
00:01:40,674 --> 00:01:42,409
Is this expired?

22
00:01:42,409 --> 00:01:43,243
It's from yesterday.

23
00:01:44,978 --> 00:01:46,213
I'll help myself with it then.

24
00:01:55,222 --> 00:01:56,657
Strawberry-flavored.

25
00:01:57,391 --> 00:01:58,258
Cheers.

26
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:07,501
It looks weird.

27
00:02:11,939 --> 00:02:13,107
What do you think?

28
00:02:14,975 --> 00:02:15,909
The whipped cream is good.

29
00:02:16,677 --> 00:02:18,879
The sponge cake has a strong egg flavor.

30
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:19,713
It's moist.

31
00:02:20,914 --> 00:02:21,548
However,

32
00:02:22,082 --> 00:02:22,850
it's too sweet.

33
00:02:23,784 --> 00:02:25,519
I won't put as much sugar then.

34
00:02:27,254 --> 00:02:28,555
You baked it?

35
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:31,625
Zi'an gave me his grandmother's recipe.

36
00:02:31,625 --> 00:02:32,426
I followed it.

37
00:02:32,926 --> 00:02:33,961
For real?

38
00:02:34,528 --> 00:02:36,096
God took your cooking talent away

39
00:02:36,096 --> 00:02:37,831
but he gave you baking talent.

40
00:02:38,365 --> 00:02:39,266
Keep this up.

41
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:40,334
Other than strawberries,

42
00:02:40,334 --> 00:02:41,568
I like chocolate too.

43
00:02:41,568 --> 00:02:43,270
Heavily flavored foods like cheese

44
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:44,438
are up my alley too.

45
00:02:44,705 --> 00:02:45,973
All right. I'll learn how to bake them.

46
00:02:47,474 --> 00:02:48,375
Am I dreaming?

47
00:02:48,375 --> 00:02:49,710
Why are you so nice to me?

48
00:03:16,503 --> 00:03:17,337
Because I like you.

49
00:03:44,798 --> 00:03:47,901
You even made a young and handsome boy
fall in love with you.

50
00:03:49,036 --> 00:03:50,704
What are you going to do now?

51
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:53,740
No idea.

52
00:03:54,575 --> 00:03:55,542
I'm confused.

53
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:58,278
For the first time in my life,
I lost control of my emotions.

54
00:03:59,913 --> 00:04:00,914
Lost control?

55
00:04:03,584 --> 00:04:05,018
Forget about it.

56
00:04:05,352 --> 00:04:06,253
Let's crack open a good one.

57
00:04:06,253 --> 00:04:06,853
Okay.

58
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:08,155
No.

59
00:04:08,855 --> 00:04:10,557
We will drink a lot today.

60
00:04:10,857 --> 00:04:12,292
A lot, a lot.

61
00:04:12,793 --> 00:04:13,827
Enjoy it.

62
00:04:14,695 --> 00:04:17,264
Drink to your heart's content

63
00:04:17,664 --> 00:04:18,966
before you leave.

64
00:04:20,834 --> 00:04:22,903
We should celebrate it.

65
00:04:23,837 --> 00:04:25,072
Don't sulk.

66
00:04:25,072 --> 00:04:26,039
Drink.

67
00:04:26,306 --> 00:04:27,841
Chug it. Chug it.

68
00:04:27,841 --> 00:04:29,243
Chug it.

69
00:04:31,612 --> 00:04:33,313
You have an admirer now.

70
00:04:40,887 --> 00:04:43,090
You keep yawning. Are you that tired?

71
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:44,958
I stayed up late to study.

72
00:04:44,958 --> 00:04:45,959
Unlike you two,

73
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:47,327
who can apply
to the university directly,

74
00:04:47,327 --> 00:04:49,196
I have to sit for AST.

75
00:04:49,196 --> 00:04:51,932
Lame. You guys abandoned me.

76
00:04:51,932 --> 00:04:53,367
My application might be rejected anyway.

77
00:04:53,367 --> 00:04:55,068
I might have to sit for AST too.

78
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:57,104
Please.

79
00:04:57,104 --> 00:04:59,339
Once you're accepted, you're free.

80
00:04:59,339 --> 00:05:01,575
Meanwhile,
I have to rely on supplements.

81
00:05:01,575 --> 00:05:03,510
Please tutor me when you are free.

82
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:04,911
What supplements?

83
00:05:04,911 --> 00:05:05,979
My friends recommended it to me.

84
00:05:05,979 --> 00:05:07,247
It's very effective.

85
00:05:07,247 --> 00:05:08,915
It wakes you up right away.

86
00:05:15,222 --> 00:05:16,590
Hi, Mr. Gao.

87
00:05:22,095 --> 00:05:23,463
Where is Mr. Gao taking Bai Zongyi?

88
00:05:23,997 --> 00:05:25,332
God knows.

89
00:05:28,935 --> 00:05:29,803
You were

90
00:05:29,803 --> 00:05:31,471
talking about the supplements.

91
00:05:43,483 --> 00:05:44,584
When I confessed...

92
00:05:49,956 --> 00:05:51,591
You're like a little brother to me.

93
00:05:53,527 --> 00:05:54,995
You're just 17.

94
00:05:54,995 --> 00:05:57,130
It's easy to mistake
admiration for liking.

95
00:05:58,131 --> 00:06:00,667
Other than your cooking skills,
you have nothing admirable.

96
00:06:00,667 --> 00:06:02,069
I'm serious about it.

97
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:04,838
If you won't give up,

98
00:06:04,838 --> 00:06:05,572
I believe we should...

99
00:06:05,572 --> 00:06:07,073
If you cannot accept
these feelings of mine,

100
00:06:08,008 --> 00:06:09,276
then let's not meet again in the future.

101
00:06:25,659 --> 00:06:27,494
I cannot pretend
that I'm just your little brother.

102
00:06:27,494 --> 00:06:28,895
I don't want
to put you on the spot either.

103
00:06:30,964 --> 00:06:32,132
Let's end it here.

104
00:06:33,166 --> 00:06:35,102
Let's pretend we don't know each other
when we meet at school.

105
00:06:36,203 --> 00:06:37,204
Then maybe my feelings

106
00:06:37,204 --> 00:06:38,572
will disappear soon.

107
00:06:42,008 --> 00:06:44,177
Yes, like you said, I'm just 17.

108
00:06:44,578 --> 00:06:46,413
It's easy to mistake
admiration for liking.

109
00:06:49,082 --> 00:06:50,584
Don't do this.

110
00:06:55,756 --> 00:06:56,790
This is all I know how to do.

111
00:06:57,758 --> 00:06:59,192
I'm not an adult like you,

112
00:06:59,192 --> 00:07:01,194
who's good at pretending
nothing ever happened.

113
00:07:19,346 --> 00:07:21,310
(Boss)
(Come to the headquarters tonight.)

114
00:07:21,314 --> 00:07:22,716
(We need to talk.)

115
00:07:42,669 --> 00:07:43,904
Your family contacted me.

116
00:07:44,538 --> 00:07:45,539
They want you back.

117
00:07:46,873 --> 00:07:49,075
You invited me to a dinner

118
00:07:49,075 --> 00:07:50,210
and now, you're asking me to leave.

119
00:07:50,444 --> 00:07:51,511
You're quite contradictory.

120
00:07:53,046 --> 00:07:54,748
You're not too deep into the business.

121
00:07:54,748 --> 00:07:55,749
You still

122
00:07:55,749 --> 00:07:56,783
can get out.

123
00:07:58,618 --> 00:08:00,287
You don't want me to be too conspicuous,

124
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,955
yet you don't allow me to be decadent.

125
00:08:01,955 --> 00:08:03,156
What do you really want from me?

126
00:08:03,757 --> 00:08:05,025
Do I need to be reincarnated?

127
00:08:05,592 --> 00:08:07,427
This is not the place
for your decadence.

128
00:08:10,063 --> 00:08:11,164
Accept your fate.

129
00:08:11,164 --> 00:08:13,733
Go home and work for your grandfather.

130
00:08:14,434 --> 00:08:16,203
He already has enough puppets
in his hands.

131
00:08:16,203 --> 00:08:17,504
He doesn't need me.

132
00:08:17,504 --> 00:08:19,072
I want to stay here.

133
00:08:22,342 --> 00:08:23,944
Yiyun Syndicate is not a daycare center.

134
00:08:24,544 --> 00:08:26,346
It's not a place for tea parties.

135
00:08:27,547 --> 00:08:28,882
I've been trying really hard

136
00:08:28,882 --> 00:08:30,183
to be part of the syndicate.

137
00:08:31,251 --> 00:08:32,252
Really?

138
00:08:35,355 --> 00:08:37,424
You're too civilized
to intimidate anyone.

139
00:08:37,791 --> 00:08:40,160
And when we want you to kill,
you flee to your moral high ground.

140
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:43,029
How can you become
part of the syndicate like this?

141
00:08:44,664 --> 00:08:46,500
Enough. Don't argue

142
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,101
during dinner.

143
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:51,805
Even if it's a fact,

144
00:08:51,805 --> 00:08:53,073
you have to sugarcoat it.

145
00:08:53,707 --> 00:08:55,141
Kids,
they can't stomach the harsh truth.

146
00:08:57,544 --> 00:08:58,778
I'm not a kid.

147
00:09:02,148 --> 00:09:02,649
You're here.

148
00:09:02,649 --> 00:09:03,450
Boss.

149
00:09:04,084 --> 00:09:04,985
Boss.

150
00:09:05,585 --> 00:09:06,653
Right on time.

151
00:09:06,653 --> 00:09:07,821
Take a seat.

152
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:12,526
Ten days left

153
00:09:13,093 --> 00:09:14,127
until you bring Zhang Teng to me.

154
00:09:15,996 --> 00:09:17,030
No work discussion

155
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:18,665
during dinner.

156
00:09:19,032 --> 00:09:19,833
Okay.

157
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,036
Come, dig in before the food gets cold.

158
00:09:23,603 --> 00:09:24,738
I prepared

159
00:09:24,738 --> 00:09:26,640
this spicy broth

160
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,541
for you.

161
00:09:29,609 --> 00:09:30,510
Thanks, Boss.

162
00:09:52,365 --> 00:09:53,567
It won't be as spicy that way.

163
00:09:58,171 --> 00:10:00,473
Don't just stare at me. Eat.

164
00:10:00,941 --> 00:10:02,008
Do I have to feed you now?

165
00:10:09,816 --> 00:10:10,850
Do you like it?

166
00:10:15,021 --> 00:10:17,257
Should we invest in the restaurant?

167
00:10:17,257 --> 00:10:18,792
You can then have it every day.

168
00:10:21,361 --> 00:10:22,462
Don't you have enough work to do?

169
00:10:23,096 --> 00:10:24,998
It's not work when it's about you.

170
00:10:32,172 --> 00:10:33,273
Come.

171
00:10:33,273 --> 00:10:34,874
Enjoy while it's warm.

172
00:10:36,543 --> 00:10:37,510
Come.

173
00:10:38,511 --> 00:10:39,412
Come.

174
00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:05,580

(Keep this up. Other than strawberries,)

176
00:11:14,781 --> 00:11:15,882
I like chocolate too.

198
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:46,372
Hello?

199
00:12:46,372 --> 00:12:47,440
Zongyi,

200
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,408
I saw the news

201
00:12:48,408 --> 00:12:50,076
that a storm is coming.

202
00:12:50,076 --> 00:12:51,277
Are you aware of it?

203
00:12:52,345 --> 00:12:53,246
Yes.

204
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:56,216
I won't flood my apartment
like I did last year.

205
00:12:57,484 --> 00:12:59,552
You sound weird.

206
00:12:59,552 --> 00:13:01,554
Are you upset or something?

207
00:13:01,821 --> 00:13:02,655
No.

208
00:13:02,956 --> 00:13:05,759
That's three keys lower
than your usual tone.

209
00:13:06,192 --> 00:13:07,494
You're bluffing.

210
00:13:08,261 --> 00:13:10,330
My musicality is top-notch.

211
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:11,831
You can't lie to me.

212
00:13:13,133 --> 00:13:14,868
A breakup?

213
00:13:16,836 --> 00:13:17,871
No.

214
00:13:18,171 --> 00:13:19,305
Not at all.

215
00:13:19,706 --> 00:13:21,474
Dad! Zongyi said that he was dumped.

216
00:13:21,474 --> 00:13:23,076
He hid his relationship from us!

217
00:13:23,076 --> 00:13:24,744
Come. Look at Zongyi.

218
00:13:24,744 --> 00:13:26,379
Bai Jingyu, don't be ridiculous.

219
00:13:26,379 --> 00:13:27,680
It's not a breakup.

220
00:13:29,349 --> 00:13:30,116
Zongyi.

221
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:32,018
I'm glad that you are in a relationship.

222
00:13:32,018 --> 00:13:33,653
Don't just study all day long.

223
00:13:33,653 --> 00:13:34,954
Dad, he was dumped.

224
00:13:34,954 --> 00:13:35,955
In a bad way.

225
00:13:35,955 --> 00:13:36,923
That soon?

226
00:13:36,923 --> 00:13:38,958
Who is that?

227
00:13:39,659 --> 00:13:40,560
Zongyi, listen.

228
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,629
A breakup is like a vaccine.

229
00:13:42,629 --> 00:13:44,697
After you survive one,
it won't hurt as much anymore.

230
00:13:44,697 --> 00:13:46,332
Don't worry.
Dad and I will keep you company.

231
00:13:46,933 --> 00:13:48,835
Bai Jingyu, don't be nosy.

232
00:13:50,436 --> 00:13:52,339
Dad, how are you?

233
00:13:52,339 --> 00:13:54,040
The weather has been fluctuating
between cold and hot lately.

234
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,541
You need to be careful
because of your weak heart.

235
00:13:55,541 --> 00:13:57,477
I'm fine. Don't worry.

236
00:13:57,477 --> 00:13:58,444
The doctor...

237
00:13:58,444 --> 00:13:59,679
Brat.

238
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:01,080
Don't change the topic.

239
00:14:01,347 --> 00:14:03,683
Tell me. What happened between you two?

240
00:14:03,683 --> 00:14:06,152
If it's just a misunderstanding,
you need to talk it out.

241
00:14:06,152 --> 00:14:07,620
It's not a breakup, Dad.

242
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:09,222
I'm serious.

243
00:14:09,656 --> 00:14:11,024
Tell us already.

244
00:14:11,024 --> 00:14:12,725
Let us help you.

245
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:33,746
He only tries to get Boss' attention
by drinking with him.

246
00:14:35,148 --> 00:14:36,683
That's no way to woo someone.

247
00:14:36,683 --> 00:14:38,117
Coward.

248
00:14:39,219 --> 00:14:40,720
He'll stay a virgin forever.

249
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:45,525
Don't insult him when he's drunk.

250
00:14:46,292 --> 00:14:47,994
If Chen Yi couldn't take any insults,

251
00:14:47,994 --> 00:14:49,596
he would have killed me already.

252
00:14:49,596 --> 00:14:51,831
Quit mentioning kill or murder.
You're young.

253
00:14:53,666 --> 00:14:55,468
While we are younger than you,

254
00:14:56,202 --> 00:14:58,404
we are thugs for far longer than you.

255
00:14:58,404 --> 00:14:59,973
By right,
you should call us elder brothers.

256
00:15:01,307 --> 00:15:04,510
We didn't nitpick
because you're a friend and a guest.

257
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,882
Why does everyone say
I'm not fit to be a thug?

258
00:15:08,882 --> 00:15:09,816
What do I lack?

259
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:15,255
You lack the will
to sacrifice your life.

260
00:15:16,589 --> 00:15:17,924
And you have a safety net
to fall back on.

261
00:15:20,326 --> 00:15:22,195
A thug's life
isn't for those who want to live.

262
00:15:27,367 --> 00:15:28,668
Careful.

263
00:15:32,305 --> 00:15:33,139
Mind the steps.

264
00:15:38,845 --> 00:15:40,280
You're heavy.

265
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:47,220
Tell me then.

266
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:48,855
How am I supposed to woo him?

267
00:15:50,924 --> 00:15:52,659
You're wasted.

268
00:15:52,659 --> 00:15:54,694
You should have confessed.

269
00:15:55,328 --> 00:15:56,930
If you don't know how to confess,
then go learn.

270
00:15:56,930 --> 00:15:57,764
It's that simple.

271
00:15:57,764 --> 00:15:58,932
Whom to learn from?

272
00:15:59,799 --> 00:16:00,833
From you?

273
00:16:03,269 --> 00:16:04,804
Why would I turn to a kid like you?

274
00:16:05,472 --> 00:16:07,273
You're only three years older than me,
what's so great about that?

275
00:16:07,507 --> 00:16:09,809
Is being a virgin for 21 years
an achievement now?

276
00:16:09,809 --> 00:16:11,411
Wait. Do you have a problem downstairs?

277
00:16:11,411 --> 00:16:13,146
That's why you're too afraid
to make a move.

278
00:16:13,713 --> 00:16:15,615
Lame.

279
00:16:16,849 --> 00:16:18,284
Say that again.

280
00:16:18,284 --> 00:16:20,219
You like insults, eh?

281
00:16:20,219 --> 00:16:22,255
Impotent. You're simply impotent.

282
00:16:22,255 --> 00:16:23,289
You can't get it up

283
00:16:23,289 --> 00:16:24,123
so...

284
00:16:32,432 --> 00:16:33,833
What is wrong with you?

285
00:16:46,479 --> 00:16:48,081
Leave!

286
00:17:09,769 --> 00:17:11,437
(What is Ai Di to you?)

287
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:26,250
(Meeting Agenda)

288
00:17:26,252 --> 00:17:28,254
Listen up.

289
00:17:28,254 --> 00:17:29,622
We need to decide

290
00:17:29,622 --> 00:17:32,392
who will participate
in the Costume Design Contest.

291
00:17:32,392 --> 00:17:35,228
I need to submit
the sign-up form already.

292
00:17:38,898 --> 00:17:39,899
Bai Zongyi.

293
00:17:39,899 --> 00:17:40,900
Do you want to participate in it?

294
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:42,101
The winner can win some prize money.

295
00:17:43,169 --> 00:17:44,303
I'm busy.

296
00:17:45,938 --> 00:17:46,973
Excuse me, transfer student.

297
00:17:46,973 --> 00:17:48,641
Are you interested in it?

298
00:17:48,641 --> 00:17:50,143
Hello?

299
00:17:50,143 --> 00:17:51,744
Edison, do you hear me?

300
00:17:57,483 --> 00:17:58,985
Would you like to participate
in the costume...

301
00:17:58,985 --> 00:17:59,886
No.

302
00:18:07,527 --> 00:18:08,828
Why did you take my seat then?

303
00:18:25,879 --> 00:18:27,680
You pretend to be a transfer student
and come to my school.

304
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,614
Is it for the same reason

305
00:18:28,614 --> 00:18:30,116
as Fan Zherui?

306
00:18:30,116 --> 00:18:31,050
He told you everything?

307
00:18:35,021 --> 00:18:37,320
(Rui)
(I have a way to lure the culprit,)

308
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,825
(Rui)
(and I'll need your help.)

309
00:18:38,991 --> 00:18:40,860
Come on, guys.

310
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:43,463
The winner will be awarded 5,000.

311
00:18:44,163 --> 00:18:47,233
Five thousand! Isn't that a lot?

312
00:18:47,733 --> 00:18:49,969
Please everyone,
actively sign up to participate.

313
00:18:49,969 --> 00:18:51,003
Me.

314
00:18:51,404 --> 00:18:52,738
Bai Zongyi and I will sign up.

315
00:18:56,742 --> 00:18:58,411
I didn't say anything.

316
00:18:58,411 --> 00:18:59,011
Money!

317
00:18:59,011 --> 00:18:59,812
Good!

318
00:19:00,613 --> 00:19:02,748
Edison and Bai Zongyi

319
00:19:02,748 --> 00:19:04,717
will represent our class.

320
00:19:04,717 --> 00:19:06,352
Come. A round of applause!

321
00:19:12,825 --> 00:19:15,194
Fang Zi'an, I didn't say yes.

322
00:19:15,194 --> 00:19:16,362
Sorry? You want me to write your name?

323
00:19:16,362 --> 00:19:18,264
Sure, I'll help you with that.

324
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:29,108
You're here as a transfer student

325
00:19:29,108 --> 00:19:30,376
because you have a business to settle.

326
00:19:30,376 --> 00:19:32,011
Why did you sign up
for the costume design contest?

327
00:19:32,011 --> 00:19:34,046
Can't I enjoy
high school life for once?

328
00:19:34,046 --> 00:19:35,648
Do I look like a student?

329
00:19:36,449 --> 00:19:38,251
You are my age anyway.

330
00:19:39,986 --> 00:19:41,120
Why aren't you studying at school?

331
00:19:42,522 --> 00:19:43,956
Because I'm a genius.

332
00:19:43,956 --> 00:19:44,757
I don't need to study.

333
00:19:45,625 --> 00:19:46,592
Anyway,

334
00:19:47,226 --> 00:19:48,227
don't worry

335
00:19:48,227 --> 00:19:49,428
about the contest.

336
00:19:49,428 --> 00:19:50,630
I will prepare everything.

337
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:52,165
If we win, you pocket the prize.

338
00:19:52,832 --> 00:19:53,733
Deal?

339
00:19:57,003 --> 00:19:58,237
Don't look at me like that.

340
00:19:58,771 --> 00:20:01,007
You're just like Rui.

341
00:20:03,543 --> 00:20:04,477
How is he?

342
00:20:07,146 --> 00:20:07,914
Good.

343
00:20:08,948 --> 00:20:10,850
He works till very late.

344
00:20:11,017 --> 00:20:12,718
He doesn't sleep a lot.

345
00:20:13,119 --> 00:20:15,054
And he barely eats.

346
00:20:16,489 --> 00:20:18,424
If you're worried about him,
go and find him.

347
00:20:19,859 --> 00:20:21,160
I can't.

348
00:20:23,095 --> 00:20:24,063
Why?

349
00:20:25,398 --> 00:20:26,666
Because I'm in love with him.

350
00:20:30,503 --> 00:20:32,271
Only when the day comes
that I no longer like him,

351
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:36,342
can I be the friend or brother he wants.

352
00:20:50,556 --> 00:20:52,058
Stupid weather.

353
00:20:52,758 --> 00:20:54,760
It's windy and stormy.

354
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,762
Ai Di, are you holding a costume party?

355
00:20:59,865 --> 00:21:00,733
Stash them well.

356
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:02,501
Don't let Mr. Yi find out.

357
00:21:04,770 --> 00:21:05,705
Okay.

358
00:21:10,776 --> 00:21:11,844
Hi, Mr. Rui.

359
00:21:15,348 --> 00:21:16,782
Have you laid the trap?

360
00:21:17,917 --> 00:21:18,985
I did as you told me.

361
00:21:19,218 --> 00:21:21,420
I let them know
that I'm looking for certain candies.

362
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:22,521
Now, we wait for him to bite the bait.

363
00:21:23,055 --> 00:21:24,090
Good.

364
00:21:26,259 --> 00:21:28,160
Bai Zongyi is sitting for an exam.

365
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,228
Don't bother him.

366
00:21:29,662 --> 00:21:31,264
I'm making money for him.

367
00:21:31,731 --> 00:21:32,698
Besides,

368
00:21:32,698 --> 00:21:33,799
we're in his class

369
00:21:33,799 --> 00:21:35,635
to provide cover for him when necessary.

370
00:21:35,635 --> 00:21:37,069
This is the role I play anyway.

371
00:21:38,004 --> 00:21:39,472
A transfer student
met his elementary school classmate.

372
00:21:39,472 --> 00:21:41,574
And they signed up
for a contest happily.

373
00:21:41,574 --> 00:21:42,508
That's great.

374
00:21:46,145 --> 00:21:46,946
What on earth?

375
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:49,048
You're not alone.

376
00:21:51,784 --> 00:21:52,918
Where are you going?

377
00:21:54,053 --> 00:21:55,688
You're supposed to do my homework!

378
00:22:12,872 --> 00:22:13,639
Bai Zongyi.

379
00:22:13,899 --> 00:22:15,200
Why are you here?

380
00:22:15,474 --> 00:22:17,476
We shouldn't see each other. Go away.

381
00:22:17,843 --> 00:22:19,445
Now is not the time to be stubborn.

382
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,348
Letting me help you

383
00:22:22,348 --> 00:22:23,582
is not going to cost you your life.

384
00:22:23,582 --> 00:22:25,885
It will. Anyone can help me.
But not you!

385
00:22:31,891 --> 00:22:32,692
Bai Zongyi.

386
00:22:35,127 --> 00:22:36,362
Fan Zherui.

387
00:22:36,362 --> 00:22:37,129
Sit down.

388
00:22:41,367 --> 00:22:42,168
Fan Zherui.

389
00:22:42,168 --> 00:22:43,135
Give me your hand.

390
00:22:45,571 --> 00:22:46,472
Press it.

391
00:22:49,175 --> 00:22:51,444
Fan Zherui, I'm fine. Go back.

392
00:22:52,645 --> 00:22:54,313
Dry yourself and go home.

393
00:22:54,947 --> 00:22:56,649
Fan Zherui! Stop touching my things.

394
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:00,686
Go home, Fan Zherui.

395
00:23:00,686 --> 00:23:01,554
Shut up.

396
00:23:09,261 --> 00:23:10,096
Bai Zongyi.

397
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:12,465
Go home.

398
00:23:12,465 --> 00:23:13,899
No need to take care of me.

399
00:23:13,899 --> 00:23:15,735
I don't want to fall for you
even harder.

400
00:23:22,441 --> 00:23:23,142
Come.

401
00:23:23,142 --> 00:23:23,876
Fan Zherui!

402
00:23:23,876 --> 00:23:25,077
Shut up.

403
00:23:25,077 --> 00:23:26,612

and live together.
