00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:15,081
So,

2
00:00:15,548 --> 00:00:17,183
our casino was raided.

3
00:00:17,717 --> 00:00:19,452
You feigned death
and managed to go unnoticed.

4
00:00:19,452 --> 00:00:20,653
Now, you come to us.

5
00:00:21,988 --> 00:00:23,089
Teng,

6
00:00:23,089 --> 00:00:24,224
Yiyun Syndicate

7
00:00:24,224 --> 00:00:26,159
is full of rookies.

8
00:00:26,159 --> 00:00:27,961
They didn't even notice me.

9
00:00:46,312 --> 00:00:47,380
What an idiot.

10
00:00:47,614 --> 00:00:49,449
Little did he know
that he led them to us.

11
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:51,418
Let's go.

12
00:00:51,418 --> 00:00:52,218
Yes.

13
00:00:57,791 --> 00:00:58,725
Find me the person

14
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:00,393
who's been helping Chen Yi
to raid our territory.

15
00:01:02,195 --> 00:01:03,563
It's time to pay him a visit.

33
00:04:19,355 --> 00:04:20,623
What are you doing?

34
00:04:20,623 --> 00:04:21,624
I'm making breakfast.

35
00:04:21,624 --> 00:04:23,492
I don't want to be poisoned by you,
so I'll make my own food.

36
00:04:28,264 --> 00:04:29,699
You're fit, kiddo.

37
00:04:31,133 --> 00:04:32,268
Don't be shy.

38
00:04:34,036 --> 00:04:35,104
Put things back properly.

39
00:04:35,104 --> 00:04:36,239
Look at your hair.

40
00:04:39,575 --> 00:04:40,743
Just do what you have to do.

41
00:04:40,743 --> 00:04:41,944
I handle this. Okay?

42
00:04:42,545 --> 00:04:43,412
Are you sure?

43
00:04:43,412 --> 00:04:44,947
I can cook better than you.

44
00:04:45,748 --> 00:04:46,749
Go back inside.

45
00:04:47,183 --> 00:04:48,618
You want me to button your shirt?

46
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:05,768
To celebrate the tenth day

47
00:05:05,768 --> 00:05:07,336
of my unforgettable sojourn here,

48
00:05:07,336 --> 00:05:09,405
we'll have something fancy
for breakfast.

49
00:05:09,405 --> 00:05:10,506
Feel free to leave.

50
00:05:10,506 --> 00:05:11,607
No one here wants you to stay.

51
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:28,758
Delicious?

52
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:35,598
Take a seat.

53
00:05:42,471 --> 00:05:43,639
(Cayenne Auto Shop)
What are you doing?

54
00:05:48,311 --> 00:05:49,145
Untie me now.

55
00:05:49,812 --> 00:05:52,548
Sichuan pepper, chili pepper,
and hot pepper.

56
00:05:52,548 --> 00:05:55,217
It will numb and burn you.

57
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:58,287
They are my favorites.

58
00:05:58,788 --> 00:06:00,022
You should try them.

59
00:06:00,022 --> 00:06:01,424
Bugger off.

60
00:06:06,629 --> 00:06:08,798
Untie me now, or you'll pay for it.

61
00:06:08,798 --> 00:06:10,232
I'll kill you!

62
00:06:10,766 --> 00:06:12,001
I'm scared.

63
00:06:12,468 --> 00:06:13,536
Why don't you tell me

64
00:06:13,536 --> 00:06:15,971
where Rui is?

65
00:06:18,341 --> 00:06:19,442
You won't tell me?

66
00:06:19,842 --> 00:06:20,609
Fine.

67
00:06:28,984 --> 00:06:30,686
Where is Rui?

68
00:06:30,686 --> 00:06:32,221
What are you two planning?

69
00:06:32,555 --> 00:06:33,856
Why am I excluded?

70
00:06:33,856 --> 00:06:34,857
You're overthinking it.

71
00:06:34,857 --> 00:06:36,192
Well, that better be the case.

72
00:06:36,192 --> 00:06:37,626
You keep everything from me.

73
00:06:39,261 --> 00:06:40,296
You still won't confess?

74
00:06:40,863 --> 00:06:41,731
Fine.

75
00:06:43,366 --> 00:06:43,966
The missing Rui

76
00:06:43,966 --> 00:06:45,434
gives us a reason to send our men out.

77
00:06:45,434 --> 00:06:47,436
That way, we can eliminate
Zhang Teng's people at the same time.

78
00:06:50,339 --> 00:06:51,874
So this is the plan.

79
00:06:52,675 --> 00:06:53,910
What if Boss finds out

80
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:55,211
that you gave orders without permission

81
00:06:55,211 --> 00:06:56,145
and got mad?

82
00:06:57,646 --> 00:06:58,881
Coward.

83
00:06:59,348 --> 00:07:00,583
Shut up.

84
00:07:16,665 --> 00:07:18,167
Show Boss some respect.

85
00:07:18,167 --> 00:07:19,602
And don't ever do this again.

86
00:07:19,602 --> 00:07:20,970
Like I care.

87
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:22,471
I will have my refriend.

88
00:07:22,471 --> 00:07:24,440
It's "I will have my revenge",
you dummy.

89
00:07:26,409 --> 00:07:27,510
Whatever.

90
00:07:30,045 --> 00:07:31,380
Hey!

91
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:32,481
Come back!

92
00:07:33,949 --> 00:07:35,117
Untie me!

93
00:07:36,218 --> 00:07:37,853
I'll kill you!

94
00:07:40,556 --> 00:07:42,792
That's all for today. Class dismissed.

95
00:07:42,792 --> 00:07:43,759
Thank you, ma'am.

96
00:07:48,397 --> 00:07:49,165
Thanks.

97
00:07:49,665 --> 00:07:51,500
Bai Zongyi, are you having
instant noodles again?

98
00:07:52,535 --> 00:07:53,335
What is this?

99
00:07:54,069 --> 00:07:55,304
You made this?

100
00:07:56,038 --> 00:07:56,705
What on earth?

101
00:07:56,705 --> 00:07:58,274
You brought your lunch box.

102
00:07:58,274 --> 00:07:59,408
It's the leftover from my breakfast.

103
00:07:59,708 --> 00:08:00,910
Breakfast?

104
00:08:08,517 --> 00:08:09,218
What's this?

105
00:08:10,052 --> 00:08:11,587
Breakfast leftover.
We shouldn't waste food,

106
00:08:11,587 --> 00:08:12,221
so it's your lunch.

107
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:24,633
You had a sumptuous breakfast.

108
00:08:25,067 --> 00:08:25,835
Let me take a bite.

109
00:08:26,302 --> 00:08:26,969
And another bite.

110
00:08:27,369 --> 00:08:27,870
Stop.

111
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:28,971
Hey! It's my lunch.

112
00:08:29,205 --> 00:08:30,439
Bai Zongyi, don't be a cheapskate.

113
00:08:30,773 --> 00:08:31,373
Sining.

114
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,308
Sining.

115
00:08:32,508 --> 00:08:33,242
Stop!

116
00:08:35,811 --> 00:08:36,545
What?

117
00:08:38,914 --> 00:08:41,050
Don't be stingy. Just one bite!

118
00:09:06,842 --> 00:09:08,511
You didn't tell me
that you would come back late.

119
00:09:08,511 --> 00:09:09,578
All the dishes are cold now.

120
00:09:12,047 --> 00:09:13,249
I was tutoring my classmate.

121
00:09:21,357 --> 00:09:22,525
Did you use everything

122
00:09:22,525 --> 00:09:23,626
in the fridge?

123
00:09:23,626 --> 00:09:25,027
You can always do grocery.

124
00:09:25,027 --> 00:09:26,428
I don't want to skimp on your meal.

125
00:09:28,163 --> 00:09:30,299
Don't worry. I'll reimburse you
triple the cost.

126
00:09:30,299 --> 00:09:31,233
Money

127
00:09:31,233 --> 00:09:32,568
can't solve everything.

128
00:09:33,035 --> 00:09:35,137
But it can solve your current problem.

129
00:09:39,875 --> 00:09:40,943
Bai Zongyi.

130
00:09:47,683 --> 00:09:49,218
We agreed that I would be the one
organizing math notes.

131
00:09:49,218 --> 00:09:50,185
You...

132
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:56,091
Does this hurt your self-esteem?

133
00:09:57,192 --> 00:09:58,727
Count yourself lucky already.

134
00:09:58,727 --> 00:09:59,128
My problems

135
00:09:59,128 --> 00:10:00,829
cannot be solved by money.

136
00:10:01,363 --> 00:10:02,164
You deserve it.

137
00:10:03,732 --> 00:10:05,634
Yes, I deserve it.

138
00:10:09,538 --> 00:10:12,575
So let me earn the chance
to have the cake.

139
00:10:21,717 --> 00:10:23,052
You won't scam me, will you?

140
00:10:23,052 --> 00:10:25,020
If the notes are sold out,
I'll have money to buy you a cake.

141
00:10:25,421 --> 00:10:26,322
That's so long.

142
00:10:26,655 --> 00:10:27,623
But I'm poor.

143
00:10:28,824 --> 00:10:30,059
Fine.

144
00:10:36,932 --> 00:10:38,200
I knew it would rain.

145
00:10:42,671 --> 00:10:43,505
Bai Zongyi.

146
00:10:45,774 --> 00:10:46,642
Bai Zongyi.

147
00:10:47,843 --> 00:10:48,744
Bai Zongyi.

148
00:10:49,545 --> 00:10:50,245
Are you all right?

149
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:52,448
Bai Zongyi.

150
00:10:56,151 --> 00:10:58,120
(Why are you doing this?)

151
00:11:01,123 --> 00:11:02,424
Bai Zongyi.

152
00:11:04,059 --> 00:11:05,227
(Tell me!)

153
00:11:05,227 --> 00:11:06,862
(I gave birth to you!)

154
00:11:06,862 --> 00:11:08,230
(Don't hit me, Mommy.)

155
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:09,298
(I'll be a good boy.)

156
00:11:09,999 --> 00:11:11,400
(I don't believe you.)

157
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,768
(You will never be a good boy!)

158
00:11:12,768 --> 00:11:15,104
(You are just like your father!)

159
00:11:15,104 --> 00:11:16,739
(Do you hear me?)

160
00:11:29,051 --> 00:11:30,819
It's okay, Bai Zongyi.

161
00:11:30,819 --> 00:11:31,887
You'll be fine.

162
00:11:32,621 --> 00:11:35,224
There is no lightning
or thunder outside.

163
00:11:35,224 --> 00:11:37,092
I got you.

164
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,194
It's all right.

165
00:11:39,194 --> 00:11:41,230
There, there.

166
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:42,531
It's all right.

167
00:11:42,531 --> 00:11:43,632
You'll be fine.

168
00:11:44,967 --> 00:11:47,436
It'll be all right. I got you.

169
00:11:52,307 --> 00:11:53,609
There, there.

170
00:12:10,392 --> 00:12:12,461
You're not alone.

171
00:12:13,395 --> 00:12:14,697
The power came back.

172
00:12:14,697 --> 00:12:16,498
You're fine now.

173
00:12:17,099 --> 00:12:18,300
There's no lightning.

174
00:12:23,238 --> 00:12:24,540
It's okay now.

175
00:12:26,642 --> 00:12:27,943
All is good.

176
00:12:29,712 --> 00:12:31,013
The power came back.

177
00:12:41,056 --> 00:12:42,391
How do you feel?

178
00:12:46,261 --> 00:12:47,463
Are you all right?

179
00:12:50,599 --> 00:12:51,800
Are you okay?

180
00:12:52,434 --> 00:12:53,502
I'm fine.

181
00:13:44,753 --> 00:13:46,855
Come. You can take this side.

182
00:13:48,524 --> 00:13:49,725
It's a single bed.

183
00:13:49,725 --> 00:13:51,226
And I need to finalize
the math notes tonight...

184
00:13:51,226 --> 00:13:53,595
Everything is on schedule. Don't worry.

185
00:13:54,396 --> 00:13:55,931
So, come.

186
00:13:56,632 --> 00:13:57,566
Many people

187
00:13:57,566 --> 00:13:59,268
would kill to sleep by my side.

188
00:13:59,835 --> 00:14:01,436
Don't miss out. Come on.

189
00:14:06,375 --> 00:14:07,543
What are you doing?

190
00:14:15,017 --> 00:14:16,051
Let me go!

191
00:14:16,819 --> 00:14:18,754
We exchange secrets or I sleep with you.

192
00:14:18,754 --> 00:14:19,822
Pick one.

193
00:14:20,556 --> 00:14:21,723
Neither.

194
00:14:21,723 --> 00:14:22,691
Then I'll pester you all night

195
00:14:22,691 --> 00:14:23,959
so that you can't sleep.

196
00:14:23,959 --> 00:14:24,726
It'll be so loud

197
00:14:24,726 --> 00:14:25,894
that your neighbor will complain.

198
00:14:26,829 --> 00:14:28,330
Your landlord lives downstairs,
doesn't he?

199
00:14:28,697 --> 00:14:30,532
Do you know any tricks
other than coercion?

200
00:14:30,532 --> 00:14:32,434
Why use another tactic when it works?

201
00:18:04,279 --> 00:18:05,414
During the reign of Emperor Xiaowu,

202
00:18:05,414 --> 00:18:06,681
there was a fisherman in Wuling.

203
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:09,284
This means...

204
00:18:09,284 --> 00:18:11,420
Sorry, I'm late.

205
00:18:14,823 --> 00:18:16,425
Sit down.

206
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:19,227
Listen.

207
00:18:20,195 --> 00:18:24,199
The fisherman walked along the stream.
Fallen petals adorned his path.

208
00:18:26,835 --> 00:18:28,837
Did your cat eat your alarm clock?

209
00:18:28,837 --> 00:18:30,105
You're actually late.

210
00:18:30,105 --> 00:18:31,173
Fang Zi'an.

211
00:18:31,606 --> 00:18:32,441
What's the answer?

212
00:18:35,377 --> 00:18:36,478
It's about integrity.

213
00:18:37,879 --> 00:18:39,014
Integrity?

214
00:19:02,137 --> 00:19:03,105
Morning.

215
00:19:05,173 --> 00:19:06,475
Morning, my dear.

216
00:19:18,487 --> 00:19:20,188
What is wrong with you, Fan Zherui?

217
00:19:25,093 --> 00:19:25,961
Morning.

218
00:19:26,495 --> 00:19:27,562
Good morning.

219
00:19:34,769 --> 00:19:35,570
Bai Zongyi.

220
00:19:36,071 --> 00:19:37,272
You're late today.

221
00:19:37,272 --> 00:19:39,141
You missed your attendance,
so you'll lose your scholarship.

222
00:19:39,141 --> 00:19:40,542
What are you going to do?

223
00:19:40,542 --> 00:19:41,610
What else?

224
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:43,311
I'll just have to work extra.

225
00:19:43,311 --> 00:19:44,513
Work?

226
00:19:44,746 --> 00:19:45,780
I see it now.

227
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:46,681
The cat you adopted

228
00:19:46,681 --> 00:19:47,782
is black, right?

229
00:19:47,782 --> 00:19:48,817
Does it matter?

230
00:19:48,817 --> 00:19:51,419
A black cat brings misfortune!
You don't know?

231
00:19:51,887 --> 00:19:53,955
That's why you're on an unlucky streak.

232
00:19:53,955 --> 00:19:55,891
You should give it
to an adoption center.

233
00:19:55,891 --> 00:19:57,425
What adoption center?

234
00:19:57,425 --> 00:19:58,894
The cat he adopted.

235
00:19:58,894 --> 00:20:00,996
Ever since he adopted the cat,
bad things have kept happening to him.

236
00:20:00,996 --> 00:20:02,597
He should give it away.

237
00:20:02,597 --> 00:20:04,466
Abandoning a cat
right after you adopted it.

238
00:20:04,466 --> 00:20:06,134
I feel bad for the pet.

239
00:20:06,134 --> 00:20:07,536
Give it another chance.

240
00:20:07,536 --> 00:20:10,071
My grandma told me that you needed
to discipline your pet too.

241
00:20:10,071 --> 00:20:10,805
Discipline it.

242
00:20:10,805 --> 00:20:12,841
Hit it lightly once to twice
to teach it to behave.

243
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:14,409
You're so cruel.

244
00:20:14,409 --> 00:20:15,377
Animal abusers will be fined.

245
00:20:15,377 --> 00:20:16,778
I might just report you
to the authority.

246
00:20:22,384 --> 00:20:24,452
He sure packs a mean punch.

247
00:20:25,387 --> 00:20:27,189
Does he not know that my face
is my livelihood?

248
00:20:37,799 --> 00:20:39,501
Bai Zongyi, are you still mad at me?

249
00:20:40,135 --> 00:20:41,570
You hold grudges.

250
00:20:51,346 --> 00:20:52,280
Who threw that?

251
00:20:53,915 --> 00:20:54,649
Me.

252
00:20:54,916 --> 00:20:55,617
Did you not see us?

253
00:20:55,617 --> 00:20:56,718
Is this how you throw the trash?

254
00:20:56,718 --> 00:20:57,352
I'm sorry.

255
00:20:57,352 --> 00:20:58,687
We didn't mean it. Sorry.

256
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:00,789
If I accept your apology,
no one will respect me.

257
00:21:00,789 --> 00:21:01,690
What do you want?

258
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:02,857
- Oh, yeah?
- Sorry. Sorry.

259
00:21:02,857 --> 00:21:04,192
We didn't mean it.

260
00:21:04,192 --> 00:21:04,726
Sorry.

261
00:21:04,726 --> 00:21:06,294
- He just got dumped.
- Watch where you're going now.

262
00:21:06,294 --> 00:21:07,295
Don't let me run into you again.

263
00:21:07,729 --> 00:21:08,663
What is wrong with you?

264
00:21:10,966 --> 00:21:12,167
Bai Zongyi.

265
00:21:12,167 --> 00:21:13,501
What is the matter with you today?

266
00:21:48,937 --> 00:21:50,105
I completed the math notes.

267
00:21:50,105 --> 00:21:51,506
Can you forgive me now?

268
00:21:57,078 --> 00:21:58,380
Look.

269
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:00,015
I apologize
for what happened this morning, okay?

270
00:22:01,249 --> 00:22:02,384
You punched me.

271
00:22:02,384 --> 00:22:03,918
We're even now.

272
00:22:07,355 --> 00:22:07,989
Come on.

273
00:22:07,989 --> 00:22:08,823
Be a man.

274
00:22:08,823 --> 00:22:10,892
No one takes
their first kiss seriously anymore.

275
00:22:11,626 --> 00:22:12,994
You're quite good-looking.
Surely, you had...

276
00:22:12,994 --> 00:22:13,695
Regardless,

277
00:22:13,695 --> 00:22:14,229
it doesn't mean

278
00:22:14,229 --> 00:22:15,930
you can do that to anybody.

279
00:22:16,865 --> 00:22:17,899
I already apologized.

280
00:22:17,899 --> 00:22:18,800
And I completed the notes to...

281
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,468
The math notes are your responsibility.
We agreed on that.

282
00:22:20,468 --> 00:22:22,437
Apology? That doesn't mean
I should forgive you.

283
00:22:22,437 --> 00:22:23,838
And I don't see

284
00:22:23,838 --> 00:22:25,173
any sincere remorse from you anyway.

285
00:22:25,173 --> 00:22:26,474
Or do you think
being older than me means

286
00:22:26,474 --> 00:22:28,376
you can pull pranks on me now?

287
00:22:28,376 --> 00:22:29,210
You made a mistake,

288
00:22:29,210 --> 00:22:30,979
and you think candy
will make me forgive you?

289
00:22:30,979 --> 00:22:31,780
This is not what I mean...

290
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:32,614
But this is

291
00:22:32,614 --> 00:22:33,748
what you make me feel.

292
00:22:34,282 --> 00:22:35,016
If being a man

293
00:22:35,016 --> 00:22:35,984
means you can kiss anyone

294
00:22:35,984 --> 00:22:37,152
and hold a cavalier attitude.

295
00:22:37,152 --> 00:22:38,186
I don't need it!

296
00:22:38,186 --> 00:22:38,787
Not everyone

297
00:22:38,787 --> 00:22:40,155
is as frivolous as you.

298
00:22:55,170 --> 00:22:57,972
How lucky is he to be able
to take life seriously.

299
00:23:19,294 --> 00:23:23,098
(When are you coming back?)

300
00:23:34,876 --> 00:23:36,544
Hello?

301
00:23:36,544 --> 00:23:37,979
If someone pisses you off,

302
00:23:37,979 --> 00:23:39,581
what does he need to do to pacify you?

303
00:23:40,115 --> 00:23:42,784
Those who piss me off
won't live to see another day.

304
00:23:43,752 --> 00:23:44,986
Right. I shouldn't have come to you.

305
00:23:44,986 --> 00:23:46,588
You are just about the same age.

306
00:23:47,989 --> 00:23:49,391
What?

307
00:23:49,391 --> 00:23:51,292
Nothing. Bye.

308
00:23:51,292 --> 00:23:52,160
Hello?

309
00:24:03,037 --> 00:24:03,638
I am sick

310
00:24:03,638 --> 00:24:05,173
of your silent treatment.

311
00:24:09,043 --> 00:24:10,278
I am angry.

312
00:24:10,278 --> 00:24:11,379
Very angry.

313
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:13,515
What do you want?

314
00:24:13,515 --> 00:24:14,482
Do you want to fight?

315
00:24:14,482 --> 00:24:15,750
