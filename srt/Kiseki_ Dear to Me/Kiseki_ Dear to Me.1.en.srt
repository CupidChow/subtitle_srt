(March 2023)

2
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:32,690
Don't look back!

3
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:35,730
Don't look back.

4
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:36,900
And don't say goodbye.

5
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:41,140
Darn it. I just said...

6
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:44,940
What's so funny? It's your fault.

7
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:06,230
Hop in.

8
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:10,330
Let's go.

9
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:11,530
Ai Di!

10
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,170
Hey! What's this, Chen Yi?

11
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:17,970
Put me down! What's wrong with you?

12
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:19,940
Hey!

13
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,540
Put me down.

14
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:38,430
Bai Zongyi.

15
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:40,800
Bai Zongyi.

16
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:41,930
Go home, okay?

17
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:44,330
Your address is in the notebook.

18
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:45,730
The bus stop is to your left.

19
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:47,600
I'll come and find you. Keep in touch.

20
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:48,700
Okay.

21
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:58,950
If you want him safe,
stay away from him.

22
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:02,420
You should stay away from me.

23
00:02:13,123 --> 00:02:15,350

It's been four years.

26
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:44,790
How have you been?

00:03:25,262 --> 00:03:28,098

(November 2018)

45
00:05:23,296 --> 00:05:24,266
Be gentle.

46
00:05:38,476 --> 00:05:39,676
What is your name?

47
00:05:47,486 --> 00:05:48,816
You're an expert.

48
00:05:48,816 --> 00:05:50,016
Are you a doctor in the making?

49
00:05:57,526 --> 00:05:59,396
You shouldn't glare at your guest.

50
00:06:06,266 --> 00:06:07,436
I never want you to be my guest.

51
00:06:18,046 --> 00:06:19,146
Save me.

52
00:06:19,146 --> 00:06:20,486
Or you'll be the murderer.

53
00:06:20,856 --> 00:06:23,016
Your fingerprint is on the knife now.

54
00:06:25,486 --> 00:06:26,586
Smile.

55
00:06:30,226 --> 00:06:31,896
What a rude brat.

56
00:06:34,266 --> 00:06:35,536
Do you have food here?

57
00:06:35,536 --> 00:06:36,436
I'm hungry.

58
00:06:36,436 --> 00:06:37,736
If you want to stay here, you shut up.

59
00:06:38,966 --> 00:06:40,676
If you want to eat, you pay up.

60
00:06:40,676 --> 00:06:42,276
Sure. Put it on my tab.

61
00:06:42,276 --> 00:06:43,706
I'll pay you back double when I recover.

62
00:06:45,146 --> 00:06:46,006
Triple?

63
00:07:03,026 --> 00:07:05,096
You just broke three of my ribs.

64
00:07:06,296 --> 00:07:07,996
Saline solution, 50.

65
00:07:08,366 --> 00:07:09,836
Dressing, 20.

66
00:07:09,836 --> 00:07:10,966
You're keeping tabs.

67
00:07:10,966 --> 00:07:11,836
Of course.

68
00:07:12,541 --> 00:07:14,595
(5:12 PM)
(Part-time Job at the Soy Milk Store)

69
00:07:21,976 --> 00:07:22,776
Where are you going?

70
00:07:25,246 --> 00:07:26,216
Don't touch my things.

71
00:07:36,556 --> 00:07:38,526
Look, if I were a thief,
I would be a picky one.

72
00:07:38,526 --> 00:07:40,026
And I would never steal
from someone like you.

73
00:07:43,836 --> 00:07:44,636
Hey!

74
00:07:45,266 --> 00:07:45,966
Hey!

75
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:48,876
Hey!

76
00:07:52,306 --> 00:07:53,106
Kiddo.

77
00:07:53,546 --> 00:07:54,846
What if your place catches fire?

78
00:07:55,246 --> 00:07:56,476
It's your karma, then.

79
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:57,646
What is your name?

80
00:07:57,646 --> 00:07:58,486
Hey!

81
00:07:58,486 --> 00:07:59,216
Kiddo!

82
00:07:59,586 --> 00:08:00,516
Come back!

83
00:08:05,779 --> 00:08:07,996
(Cayenne Auto Shop)

84
00:08:10,796 --> 00:08:11,626
Rui told you to run,

85
00:08:11,626 --> 00:08:12,696
so all of you did,

86
00:08:12,696 --> 00:08:13,996
abandoning him there.

87
00:08:14,596 --> 00:08:16,236
What is our first rule?

88
00:08:16,636 --> 00:08:17,866
All for one,

89
00:08:17,866 --> 00:08:19,806
one for all.

90
00:08:19,806 --> 00:08:21,676
But Rui told us to leave him.

91
00:08:26,306 --> 00:08:28,216
Who's going to look for Rui
when all of them are injured?

92
00:08:30,046 --> 00:08:31,246
Go look for him!

93
00:08:31,246 --> 00:08:32,646
Bring him back

94
00:08:32,646 --> 00:08:33,646
before Zhang Teng finds him.

95
00:08:34,016 --> 00:08:34,886
Yes, Boss.

96
00:08:37,456 --> 00:08:38,656
Hurry up!

97
00:08:42,796 --> 00:08:43,926
That stupid Rui.

98
00:08:44,226 --> 00:08:45,766
Why did he join the brawl?

99
00:08:45,766 --> 00:08:47,366
He's the brain. He should stay behind.

100
00:08:47,366 --> 00:08:49,036
Fighting in a brawl?

101
00:08:49,396 --> 00:08:50,906
Don't let me see him again.

102
00:09:00,646 --> 00:09:01,516
An omelet, please.

103
00:09:02,946 --> 00:09:05,686
Warm soy milk, coming right up.

104
00:09:05,686 --> 00:09:07,086
Thank you.

105
00:09:11,626 --> 00:09:12,226
Sir.

106
00:09:12,226 --> 00:09:13,886
I woke up to a robbed apartment
after a hookup.

107
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:14,756
Seriously?

108
00:09:16,226 --> 00:09:17,566
Why would I lie to you?

109
00:09:18,196 --> 00:09:20,266
I thought I found the right one.

110
00:09:20,736 --> 00:09:21,536
But no.

111
00:09:21,966 --> 00:09:23,366
It was a robber.

112
00:09:23,366 --> 00:09:24,466
And then?

113
00:09:25,206 --> 00:09:27,036
I called the police.

114
00:09:28,036 --> 00:09:28,836
You see,

115
00:09:28,836 --> 00:09:30,906
she even took my decade-old

116
00:09:30,906 --> 00:09:32,276
rice cooker.

117
00:09:32,276 --> 00:09:33,806
Can you believe it?

118
00:09:34,616 --> 00:09:35,516
Those greedy jerks.

119
00:09:35,516 --> 00:09:36,416
They take everything.

120
00:09:36,416 --> 00:09:37,416
I know, right?

121
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:52,496
Do you always work until this late?

122
00:09:56,896 --> 00:09:58,036
Make sure you know the person

123
00:09:58,036 --> 00:09:59,936
cannot pry the lock open
if you want to keep him in a cage.

124
00:10:04,176 --> 00:10:05,176
If I were after your property,

125
00:10:05,176 --> 00:10:06,406
I wouldn't be standing here.

126
00:10:08,176 --> 00:10:09,146
Kiddo.

127
00:10:09,746 --> 00:10:10,786
Nothing in your apartment

128
00:10:10,786 --> 00:10:12,216
is as expensive as my shoes.

129
00:10:17,256 --> 00:10:18,556
Then bugger off.

130
00:10:18,556 --> 00:10:20,186
Don't stick your rich-person nose
into my business.

131
00:10:20,186 --> 00:10:21,496
You're a thug, aren't you?

132
00:10:21,496 --> 00:10:22,396
You did something bad

133
00:10:22,396 --> 00:10:23,456
and got beaten up.

134
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:24,626
So you hide yourself here.

135
00:10:27,866 --> 00:10:29,696
Yell more
and you might pay with your life,

136
00:10:30,196 --> 00:10:31,606
Bai Zongyi.

137
00:10:37,776 --> 00:10:39,346
I need to crash here for a few days.

138
00:10:39,346 --> 00:10:40,476
Help me

139
00:10:40,476 --> 00:10:41,746
and you will be repaid.

140
00:10:43,446 --> 00:10:45,486
I, Fan Zherui, am a man of my word.

141
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:47,246
Beg me.

142
00:10:47,246 --> 00:10:48,786
Please?

143
00:10:48,786 --> 00:10:49,656
All right?

144
00:10:50,386 --> 00:10:51,526
I'll take it as a yes.

145
00:10:51,986 --> 00:10:52,926
Thank you.

146
00:11:31,566 --> 00:11:32,096
Everyone!

147
00:11:32,096 --> 00:11:33,266
The top student in our school,

148
00:11:33,266 --> 00:11:35,136
Bai Zongyi, is here.

149
00:11:35,136 --> 00:11:36,066
His physics notes,

150
00:11:36,066 --> 00:11:38,166
including the revision guideline
organized by him personally,

151
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:39,006
are available for 30 copies.

152
00:11:39,006 --> 00:11:40,536
Calm down.
There is enough for all of you here.

153
00:11:40,536 --> 00:11:42,936
5.5, 5.6, 5.7,

154
00:11:42,936 --> 00:11:45,846
5.8, 5.9... 6 thousand.

155
00:11:47,346 --> 00:11:48,846
Here you go. Aren't I awesome?

156
00:11:51,946 --> 00:11:52,816
It's sold out?

157
00:11:52,816 --> 00:11:53,716
Yeah.

158
00:11:53,716 --> 00:11:54,986
You're too late.

159
00:11:56,586 --> 00:11:57,416
Bai Zongyi.

160
00:11:57,416 --> 00:11:58,726
Say thank you, at least.

161
00:11:59,326 --> 00:12:00,056
Thanks.

162
00:12:00,586 --> 00:12:01,696
What's wrong?

163
00:12:02,756 --> 00:12:04,596
You're looking worse by the day.

164
00:12:04,996 --> 00:12:06,196
Is it the stress from the exam?

165
00:12:07,126 --> 00:12:08,736
Or are your sales too low?

166
00:12:08,736 --> 00:12:09,566
No way.

167
00:12:09,566 --> 00:12:10,936
It's sold out.

168
00:12:11,366 --> 00:12:12,306
So, what happened?

169
00:12:12,936 --> 00:12:13,966
Fine. I'll buy more copies from you.

170
00:12:14,336 --> 00:12:15,436
You idiot.

171
00:12:15,436 --> 00:12:17,206
Having more copies
is not going to increase your score.

172
00:12:17,406 --> 00:12:18,306
Mind your own business.

173
00:12:19,176 --> 00:12:19,946
Spill it already.

174
00:12:19,946 --> 00:12:20,776
Don't make us worry.

175
00:12:22,716 --> 00:12:24,246
I ran into...

176
00:12:24,246 --> 00:12:25,246
An abandoned pet?

177
00:12:25,616 --> 00:12:26,386
A cat or a dog?

178
00:12:44,506 --> 00:12:46,106
(Cat, I guess.)

179
00:12:48,536 --> 00:12:49,436
I understand.

180
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:51,346
Cats are finicky, I tell you.

181
00:12:51,346 --> 00:12:52,846
Why did you adopt it?

182
00:12:52,846 --> 00:12:53,376
Listen,

183
00:12:53,376 --> 00:12:54,376
if there are more notes in your place,

184
00:12:54,376 --> 00:12:55,176
bring them here now.

185
00:12:55,176 --> 00:12:56,216
Because the cat will scratch them.

186
00:12:56,216 --> 00:12:57,786
That's why I'm a dog person.

187
00:12:57,786 --> 00:12:59,246
Dogs are loyal.

188
00:12:59,646 --> 00:13:01,756
And cats think we are their slaves.

189
00:13:16,536 --> 00:13:17,536
We should order takeouts.

190
00:13:18,136 --> 00:13:19,636
Pay for it first.
I'll reimburse you later.

191
00:13:27,876 --> 00:13:28,916
After your work,

192
00:13:28,916 --> 00:13:30,046
buy me a phone.

193
00:13:30,986 --> 00:13:32,216
I'll use the toilet now.

194
00:13:43,896 --> 00:13:44,496
Kiddo.

195
00:13:46,966 --> 00:13:47,866
Like you,

196
00:13:47,866 --> 00:13:50,166
I carry my valuables with me
at all times.

197
00:14:01,816 --> 00:14:03,016
You're back.

198
00:14:11,186 --> 00:14:12,126
After your work,

199
00:14:12,126 --> 00:14:13,726
buy me a strawberry cake.

200
00:14:14,556 --> 00:14:15,896
Sweet food is not good for your wounds

201
00:14:15,896 --> 00:14:17,156
because it might cause inflammation.

202
00:14:21,496 --> 00:14:22,666
It's just a slice.

203
00:14:22,666 --> 00:14:24,236
A piece of cake.

204
00:14:25,736 --> 00:14:27,306
You are annoying.

205
00:14:30,836 --> 00:14:32,776
(Why on earth did I take him in?)

206
00:14:33,846 --> 00:14:35,146
Good luck.

207
00:14:38,346 --> 00:14:39,446
It's time for our class. Let's go.

208
00:14:40,486 --> 00:14:41,356
Physics notes are sold out.

209
00:14:41,356 --> 00:14:43,656
When are you releasing math notes?
My math isn't great though.

210
00:14:43,656 --> 00:14:44,686
Can you release them sooner?

211
00:14:44,686 --> 00:14:45,786
I'll try.

212
00:14:45,786 --> 00:14:46,686
Give me four days.

213
00:14:46,686 --> 00:14:48,356
That's too long.

214
00:14:48,356 --> 00:14:49,556
Can you release them in two days?

215
00:14:49,556 --> 00:14:50,656
Please? The exam is around the corner.

216
00:14:50,656 --> 00:14:51,896
I need time to study the notes too.

217
00:14:52,226 --> 00:14:53,226
I'll try.

218
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:54,536
It's a yes, then.

219
00:14:55,196 --> 00:14:55,796
Thank you.

220
00:14:56,166 --> 00:14:57,596
I highly doubt you'll do better
in the exam.

221
00:15:04,652 --> 00:15:06,926
(Scholarship Program
of Bo-Yi Award Certificate)

222
00:15:09,624 --> 00:15:12,551
(Taipei City Award Certificate,
Mayor Huang Songhao)

223
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:28,666
He's cute when he smiles.

224
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:30,366
But he never smiles at me.

225
00:15:44,636 --> 00:15:47,024
(Free Massage Voucher)

226
00:15:47,024 --> 00:15:50,229
(Happy birthday, future doctor!
From Your Dear Sister)

227
00:15:50,816 --> 00:15:52,356
(Doctor...)

228
00:15:53,726 --> 00:15:55,996
(His family sure has
high expectations of him.)

229
00:15:59,996 --> 00:16:02,536
(Rui, listen to me.)

230
00:16:02,536 --> 00:16:04,706
(No need to get 100 in your exams.
No need to play the piano.)

231
00:16:04,706 --> 00:16:06,036
(Don't be better than your brother.)

232
00:16:06,036 --> 00:16:07,566
(That way, Grandpa will like you.)

233
00:16:07,566 --> 00:16:08,536
(He will like us.)

234
00:16:08,536 --> 00:16:09,376
(Okay?)

235
00:16:21,616 --> 00:16:22,586
Finally, you called me back

236
00:16:22,586 --> 00:16:24,486
after I called you a thousand times.

237
00:16:24,926 --> 00:16:26,156
Where are you?

238
00:16:26,156 --> 00:16:27,856
Did you deal with Zhang Teng?

239
00:16:27,856 --> 00:16:29,196
Zhang Teng and his cronies

240
00:16:29,196 --> 00:16:30,296
are missing.

241
00:16:32,796 --> 00:16:33,926
Guess I'll remain missing

242
00:16:33,926 --> 00:16:35,566
so that you have a reason
to cast your net around.

243
00:16:35,566 --> 00:16:36,666
Then, we take over his territory.

244
00:16:38,236 --> 00:16:40,306
Don't be too hard on him, though.
Play it nice.

245
00:16:40,906 --> 00:16:42,206
He used our syndicate's name
to sell drugs.

246
00:16:42,206 --> 00:16:43,236
He has to pay for it.

247
00:16:43,236 --> 00:16:45,776
You're stubborn. Just be safe.

248
00:16:46,176 --> 00:16:46,806
Oh, right.

249
00:16:46,806 --> 00:16:48,576
Don't tell Ai Di this number.

250
00:16:48,576 --> 00:16:50,776
I don't want him to call me non-stop.

251
00:16:52,246 --> 00:16:53,146
You need to be careful.

252
00:16:53,816 --> 00:16:56,016
You exposed Zhang Teng's plan.

253
00:16:56,016 --> 00:16:57,086
If he knows it was your doing,

254
00:16:57,086 --> 00:16:57,986
he won't let you live.

255
00:16:58,286 --> 00:16:59,186
Don't worry.

256
00:16:59,186 --> 00:17:00,656
I'm somewhere people least

257
00:17:00,656 --> 00:17:02,026
expect me to be.

258
00:17:02,196 --> 00:17:03,096
Once the dust has settled...

259
00:17:03,096 --> 00:17:04,356
You asked for this.

260
00:17:04,996 --> 00:17:06,066
Chen Yi?

261
00:17:10,536 --> 00:17:11,636
Pursue this lead.

262
00:17:17,406 --> 00:17:18,346
Did you get anything?

263
00:17:18,776 --> 00:17:20,646
Nothing.

264
00:17:21,946 --> 00:17:23,776
Zhang Teng is distrustful.

265
00:17:23,776 --> 00:17:25,116
Only the few close to him

266
00:17:25,116 --> 00:17:26,446
know where he is.

267
00:17:28,016 --> 00:17:29,356
Find them, then.

268
00:17:29,356 --> 00:17:30,356
We will dig up the entire ground

269
00:17:30,356 --> 00:17:31,556
even if he burrows inside.

270
00:17:31,556 --> 00:17:32,626
Why the hassle?

271
00:17:33,086 --> 00:17:34,496
We can just bury him like that.

272
00:17:50,906 --> 00:17:52,906
You want to hit me? Huh?

273
00:18:05,256 --> 00:18:06,056
Jie.

274
00:18:07,126 --> 00:18:08,326
You two will stay here.

275
00:18:08,756 --> 00:18:10,656
If you see Zhang Teng,
notify me right away.

276
00:18:10,656 --> 00:18:11,326
Yes, Boss.

277
00:18:16,366 --> 00:18:17,496
Stop gawking.

278
00:18:17,496 --> 00:18:18,606
Get to work.

279
00:18:32,286 --> 00:18:33,216
You're back.

280
00:18:36,186 --> 00:18:37,356
In the morning, say good morning.

281
00:18:37,356 --> 00:18:38,426
In the evening, say good evening.

282
00:18:38,426 --> 00:18:39,986
When you're back, say you're back.

283
00:18:39,986 --> 00:18:41,696
You won't listen to me.

284
00:18:41,696 --> 00:18:43,256
Are you sure you're a top student?

285
00:18:43,256 --> 00:18:44,526
It's none of your business.

286
00:18:47,226 --> 00:18:48,236
What are you doing?

287
00:18:48,236 --> 00:18:49,566
I took a shower.

288
00:18:49,566 --> 00:18:51,436
I haven't showered for a few days now
after I got injured.

289
00:18:51,436 --> 00:18:52,566
Can you do me a favor?

290
00:18:53,036 --> 00:18:54,066
I can't raise my arm.

291
00:18:54,676 --> 00:18:55,776
What a nuisance.

292
00:19:27,806 --> 00:19:29,176
Why did you wet the bandage?

293
00:19:29,176 --> 00:19:30,536
Do you want to recover or not?

294
00:19:33,006 --> 00:19:34,106
I have to redo your dressing.

295
00:19:34,106 --> 00:19:35,676
And mind you, I'm jotting down
all the fees.

296
00:19:35,676 --> 00:19:37,716
You owe me 4,315 now.

297
00:19:38,416 --> 00:19:39,916
You hold money way too dearly
for a student.

298
00:19:39,916 --> 00:19:41,286
It's not right.

299
00:19:41,686 --> 00:19:43,586
Being kind is more important
than being rich.

300
00:19:43,586 --> 00:19:45,986
I will be kind if I'm rich.

301
00:19:48,856 --> 00:19:49,956
Come here.

302
00:19:49,956 --> 00:19:51,196
The strawberry cake is in the fridge.

303
00:19:51,196 --> 00:19:52,526
You can have it
after I redo your dressing.

304
00:19:55,136 --> 00:19:56,036
Kiddo.

305
00:19:56,436 --> 00:19:57,536
You're so nice today.

306
00:20:28,566 --> 00:20:29,366
Thank you.

307
00:20:41,746 --> 00:20:43,116
I feel great now.

308
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:44,716
Don't worry, kiddo.

309
00:20:44,716 --> 00:20:46,586
I will reimburse you triple the money.

310
00:20:50,156 --> 00:20:51,686
If you don't like sweet things,
don't mind if I do.

311
00:20:52,026 --> 00:20:53,256
What?

312
00:20:53,256 --> 00:20:55,396
I love sweet things.

313
00:20:59,166 --> 00:21:00,596
I'm still available.

314
00:21:05,636 --> 00:21:06,606
Hello?

315
00:21:06,606 --> 00:21:07,806
Hey, Zongyi!

316
00:21:07,806 --> 00:21:09,036
Melon took a leave out of a sudden.

317
00:21:09,036 --> 00:21:10,176
Can you come now?

318
00:21:10,176 --> 00:21:11,476
Sure, I'll be right there.

319
00:21:15,376 --> 00:21:16,176
I have an urgent shift.

320
00:21:16,176 --> 00:21:16,776
The cake...

321
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:17,246
I'll eat it.

322
00:21:17,246 --> 00:21:18,716
It'll be gone when you come back.

323
00:21:21,216 --> 00:21:22,686
I wanted you to put it in the fridge!

324
00:21:26,886 --> 00:21:27,826
By the way,

325
00:21:27,826 --> 00:21:30,196
buy me egg pancakes, rice balls,
Xiaolongbaos, and soy milk as well.

326
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:31,796
I will not.

327
00:21:45,576 --> 00:21:46,376
You said you were hungry.

328
00:21:46,376 --> 00:21:47,746
But you only finished half of it.

329
00:21:48,676 --> 00:21:50,016
I'm a small eater.

330
00:21:50,016 --> 00:21:50,916
You can have it.

331
00:21:51,786 --> 00:21:52,886
What do you think I am? A trash bin?

332
00:22:10,796 --> 00:22:11,906
So you don't want it?

333
00:22:11,906 --> 00:22:13,166
I am not a trash bin.

334
00:22:15,806 --> 00:22:17,136
What are you studying?

335
00:22:20,476 --> 00:22:21,716
You got it wrong here.

336
00:22:21,716 --> 00:22:22,976
Y = sin(x).

337
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:23,776
The period is 2π.

338
00:22:23,776 --> 00:22:25,446
Its period of absolute value is π.

339
00:22:25,786 --> 00:22:27,046
Yeah, sure.

340
00:22:33,456 --> 00:22:34,456
How do you know the answer?

341
00:22:36,256 --> 00:22:37,426
You were a smart student?

342
00:22:39,696 --> 00:22:40,626
I guessed it.

343
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:41,866
Good night.

344
00:23:01,486 --> 00:23:02,816
Help me prepare math notes.

345
00:23:02,816 --> 00:23:04,356
I'll buy you a cake after.

346
00:23:04,356 --> 00:23:06,426
A whole strawberry chiffon cake
that you've been wanting to have.

347
00:23:06,886 --> 00:23:07,756
Deal.

348
00:23:20,166 --> 00:23:21,336
Where do we start?

349
00:23:21,336 --> 00:23:22,276
Chapter three.

350
00:24:28,066 --> 00:24:29,006
I found out

351
00:24:29,006 --> 00:24:31,076
who's been helping Chen Yi
to raid our territory.

352
00:24:32,746 --> 00:24:34,646
