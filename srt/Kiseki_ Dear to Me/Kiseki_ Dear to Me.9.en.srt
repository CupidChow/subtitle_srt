00:01:21,264 --> 00:01:24,260
(Ming Yang University)

19
00:01:40,308 --> 00:01:41,375
Is everything packed?

20
00:01:44,145 --> 00:01:46,714
Do you want to bring this with you?

21
00:01:47,014 --> 00:01:48,249
What is this?

22
00:01:51,652 --> 00:01:53,421
If you can't recall it,
it must be unimportant.

23
00:01:57,525 --> 00:02:00,061
Let's go.
Grandpa is waiting for you at home.

24
00:02:00,061 --> 00:02:01,395
Don't keep him waiting too long.

25
00:02:02,396 --> 00:02:05,099
You know. He doesn't have much patience.

26
00:02:06,634 --> 00:02:09,737
I don't know. I can't recall anything.

27
00:02:34,896 --> 00:02:36,197
I'm sorry, Boss.

28
00:02:37,632 --> 00:02:39,200
If anyone deserves your apologies,

29
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,435
it's Fan Zherui and Bai Zongyi.

30
00:02:41,903 --> 00:02:43,471
Especially Bai Zongyi.

31
00:02:44,939 --> 00:02:46,541
You've even involved an innocent person.

32
00:02:47,475 --> 00:02:50,478
We owe him for the rest of our lives.

33
00:02:58,219 --> 00:03:02,990
I'm very disappointed in you.

34
00:03:17,972 --> 00:03:19,507
Have you had enough? Have you?

35
00:03:20,074 --> 00:03:22,810
The Fan Family is to blame for
Bai Zongyi's predicament, not you.

36
00:03:24,645 --> 00:03:26,147
The Boss is right.

37
00:03:26,147 --> 00:03:27,448
I caused it.

38
00:03:28,182 --> 00:03:29,684
I gave them the opportunity.

39
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:32,386
I've been pushing
so hard to prove myself.

40
00:03:33,454 --> 00:03:34,855
I've failed now.

41
00:03:35,523 --> 00:03:37,091
I've let him down.

42
00:03:43,531 --> 00:03:45,600
When will you come to your senses?

43
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,802
Please come to your senses.

44
00:03:47,802 --> 00:03:50,404
When will you come to your senses?

45
00:03:51,172 --> 00:03:53,941
You worship him as a god,
but he only sees you as his son.

46
00:03:55,042 --> 00:03:56,644
Do you understand?

47
00:03:57,445 --> 00:03:59,013
He will never care for you,

48
00:03:59,313 --> 00:04:02,149
no matter how much
you like him or how hard you try.

49
00:04:04,151 --> 00:04:06,220
He will never care for you.

50
00:04:11,792 --> 00:04:13,427
I'm the only one...

51
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:20,568
I'm the only one...

52
00:04:25,106 --> 00:04:27,275
who will care for you.

53
00:04:32,113 --> 00:04:37,551
I'm the only one who has been caring
for you since I was a child.

54
00:04:40,588 --> 00:04:43,858
I'm stupid. I'm an idiot.

55
00:04:46,794 --> 00:04:48,529
Come to your senses!

56
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,701
Enough!

57
00:05:07,748 --> 00:05:09,917
It's unbearable how drunk you are.

58
00:05:39,847 --> 00:05:43,150
Chen Yi, get up.

59
00:05:49,857 --> 00:05:52,059
If Ai Di hears this, he will be angry.

60
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:21,155
Don't make me do this.

61
00:06:25,559 --> 00:06:27,194
You said you'd always be caring for me.

62
00:06:42,176 --> 00:06:43,911
You're giving me a shot.

00:10:33,307 --> 00:10:35,509
To make amends for
what happened last night, okay?

93
00:10:39,847 --> 00:10:41,181
I'll have the final say.

94
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:00,634
Hello?

95
00:11:02,136 --> 00:11:07,441
Boss, let's meet right away.

96
00:11:30,497 --> 00:11:33,467
(I'm done having fun with you. Bye)

97
00:11:36,385 --> 00:11:41,488
(Four years later)

98
00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:01,395
I have to spend two billion
to acquire a technology company

99
00:12:01,395 --> 00:12:04,732
that has only been listed
for three years for this content?

100
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:11,672
I'm sorry, Chairman.

101
00:12:11,672 --> 00:12:13,340
Get out!

102
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:15,042
Yes, Chairman.

103
00:12:19,379 --> 00:12:24,184
Be wary of Fan Zherui.

104
00:12:25,986 --> 00:12:28,956
Why? He has been a huge help
to me in recent years.

105
00:12:30,524 --> 00:12:33,293
Doesn't it seem odd
that he's become so well-behaved

106
00:12:33,293 --> 00:12:36,163
after being such a showoff in the past?

107
00:12:37,164 --> 00:12:38,232
He lost his memory.

108
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:41,101
There will always be remnants

109
00:12:41,101 --> 00:12:43,203
of his memory, no matter
how much he may have forgotten.

110
00:12:44,171 --> 00:12:46,473
He is now a totally different person.

111
00:12:46,473 --> 00:12:49,943
A simple person
is not one who can enter Fanya

112
00:12:49,943 --> 00:12:52,446
and stay with you for so many years

113
00:12:53,614 --> 00:12:55,983
without ever fighting back

114
00:12:55,983 --> 00:12:57,785
when hit or scolded.

115
00:13:30,818 --> 00:13:32,252
Don't look back.

116
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:35,422
Don't look back and don't say goodbye.

117
00:13:37,558 --> 00:13:38,625
I just said good...

118
00:13:41,128 --> 00:13:42,362
Why laugh? It's all your fault.

119
00:13:58,145 --> 00:13:59,920
Get in the car.

120
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:03,116
Let's go.

121
00:14:03,116 --> 00:14:03,984
Ai Di.

122
00:14:06,553 --> 00:14:09,323
What are you doing, Chen Yi?
Put me down!

123
00:14:09,323 --> 00:14:12,793
Are you nuts?

124
00:14:12,793 --> 00:14:13,994
Put me down!

125
00:14:28,842 --> 00:14:33,380
Bai Zongyi!
Bai Zongyi, remember to go home.

126
00:14:33,847 --> 00:14:35,816
There is your home address
in the notebook.

127
00:14:35,816 --> 00:14:38,819
Go left at the bus stop.
I will find you. Keep in touch.

128
00:14:39,386 --> 00:14:41,168
Okay.

129
00:14:47,738 --> 00:14:51,696
((Address: No. 17, Alley 5, Lane 207,
Xiucai Road, Taichung) )

130
00:15:02,142 --> 00:15:03,810
If you don't want him involved,
stay away from him.

131
00:15:05,846 --> 00:15:07,414
You should've stayed away from me.

132
00:15:09,049 --> 00:15:10,317
I'm no longer a member of the gang.

133
00:15:10,317 --> 00:15:11,618
I didn't agree that.

134
00:15:12,152 --> 00:15:14,454
The boss agreed four years ago.

135
00:15:15,422 --> 00:15:16,757
Stop the car and let me out.

136
00:15:16,757 --> 00:15:18,292
I am your boss.

137
00:15:34,141 --> 00:15:35,375
Welcome home, Ai Di.

138
00:15:35,375 --> 00:15:36,910
- Welcome home, Ai Di.
- Welcome home, Ai Di.

139
00:15:46,453 --> 00:15:47,856
What?

140
00:15:49,523 --> 00:15:51,858
Put me down, idiot.

141
00:15:52,259 --> 00:15:53,927
Are you nuts? Put me down!

142
00:15:53,927 --> 00:15:56,196
Put me down! Are you nuts?

143
00:16:00,701 --> 00:16:01,601
Eat it.

144
00:16:06,239 --> 00:16:07,174
Eat it.

145
00:16:12,145 --> 00:16:13,180
What do you want from me?

146
00:16:13,647 --> 00:16:14,848
After you eat, we can talk.

147
00:16:27,928 --> 00:16:29,296
Can I leave now?

148
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,568
After we talk, you can leave.

149
00:16:38,939 --> 00:16:40,507
Don't go too far.

150
00:16:41,675 --> 00:16:42,976
Why are you doing this?

151
00:16:47,514 --> 00:16:49,116
I don't know what you're saying.

152
00:16:49,483 --> 00:16:50,817
I was drunk that night,

153
00:16:50,817 --> 00:16:51,918
and you said you'd always...

154
00:16:51,918 --> 00:16:52,886
Are you bringing up the past?

155
00:16:56,089 --> 00:16:58,291
Okay, let's go to your room.

156
00:16:58,291 --> 00:16:59,292
What for?

157
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:00,994
To repay that day.

158
00:17:03,797 --> 00:17:04,698
Want to do it here?

159
00:17:06,366 --> 00:17:08,735
The table is quite big.

160
00:17:09,836 --> 00:17:14,074
Come on. You can do
whatever you want. Come on.

161
00:17:16,877 --> 00:17:18,678
I need an explanation.

162
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:22,115
You had virgin complex? That happened
long ago. What's wrong with you?

163
00:17:22,716 --> 00:17:23,717
Be serious.

164
00:17:25,519 --> 00:17:27,087
I'm only doing it for fun that night.

165
00:17:27,521 --> 00:17:29,790
Just for fun, okay?

166
00:17:31,858 --> 00:17:33,627
I'm no longer a member of the gang.

167
00:17:33,627 --> 00:17:35,695
Let's avoid seeing each other
to avoid problems.

168
00:17:37,597 --> 00:17:38,532
You're lying.

169
00:17:45,105 --> 00:17:46,406
Whatever you say.

170
00:17:48,141 --> 00:17:50,977
I'll find out,
no matter how long it takes.

171
00:18:37,023 --> 00:18:38,091
Zongyi!

172
00:18:40,393 --> 00:18:43,130
Father, I told you it was Zongyi,
but you didn't believe me.

173
00:18:45,799 --> 00:18:46,733
Zongyi!

174
00:18:51,638 --> 00:18:53,296
Zongyi.

175
00:18:55,742 --> 00:18:57,477
You're back.

176
00:18:58,032 --> 00:18:59,212
Father.

177
00:18:59,212 --> 00:19:02,182
Zongyi, you're finally back.

178
00:19:19,633 --> 00:19:20,734
I'm glad you're back.

179
00:19:22,969 --> 00:19:24,371
I'm back.

180
00:19:53,233 --> 00:19:55,869
Here you go. It's done.

181
00:19:59,973 --> 00:20:01,776
Eat it.

182
00:20:10,817 --> 00:20:12,519
Why are you staring at me? You eat too.

183
00:20:13,019 --> 00:20:13,887
Simply looking at you

184
00:20:13,887 --> 00:20:15,255
makes me satisfied.

185
00:20:17,991 --> 00:20:19,626
This is your favorite.

186
00:20:20,026 --> 00:20:21,127
- Eat a little more.
- Thanks.

187
00:20:21,127 --> 00:20:22,662
And this one.

188
00:20:23,029 --> 00:20:25,365
You look very thin now. Eat more food.

189
00:20:28,101 --> 00:20:30,170
Eat this. You like this too.

190
00:20:30,904 --> 00:20:32,005
And this.

191
00:20:34,874 --> 00:20:37,010
Don't just serve me.
You should eat as well.

192
00:20:37,477 --> 00:20:38,800
Eat this.

193
00:20:44,818 --> 00:20:46,953
We haven't eaten together
in a very long time.

194
00:20:54,995 --> 00:20:56,029
Jingyu...

195
00:21:01,835 --> 00:21:06,840
Jingyu always feels sorry

196
00:21:08,308 --> 00:21:11,144
for not taking good care of me,
causing you...

197
00:21:15,949 --> 00:21:19,119
Let's not talk about that. Just eat.

198
00:21:29,696 --> 00:21:30,697
Well...

199
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:42,008
- Did he ever get back to you?
- He had lost his memory.

200
00:21:43,076 --> 00:21:44,444
He'd forgotten everything.

201
00:21:48,982 --> 00:21:50,717
But if he remembered,

202
00:21:51,051 --> 00:21:52,218
he'd come to see me.

203
00:21:58,058 --> 00:21:59,025
Eat up.

204
00:22:05,198 --> 00:22:07,934
Let's have a drink to celebrate.
Have you drunk before?

205
00:22:08,868 --> 00:22:09,836
No.

206
00:22:10,603 --> 00:22:14,007
Then let's drink some beer.
For a starter, beer is fine.

207
00:22:14,674 --> 00:22:16,009
Father, is it okay for you to...

208
00:22:16,543 --> 00:22:18,411
A small amount of alcohol
has no effect on my heart.

209
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:22,015
We agreed to

210
00:22:22,015 --> 00:22:23,783
drink together when you turn eighteen.

211
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:33,927
I'll go get the beer.

212
00:22:56,783 --> 00:22:57,751
Father.

213
00:23:04,991 --> 00:23:08,395
I brought my good son to this.

214
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:14,801
Don't endanger the heart
you've had transplanted.

215
00:23:17,337 --> 00:23:20,306
Father, this is my choice.

216
00:23:20,306 --> 00:23:21,574
It's not your fault.

217
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,782
Let's start over, okay?

218
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:42,662
Let's start all over again, shall we?

219
00:23:53,776 --> 00:23:57,424
Zongyi, are you serious about donating
all of these reference books?

220
00:24:06,922 --> 00:24:08,452
Are you sure
you're not going to college?

221
00:24:10,423 --> 00:24:11,958
You have studied so well.

222
00:24:15,094 --> 00:24:16,863
I was injured here,
and now I have problems

223
00:24:16,863 --> 00:24:19,432
with short-term memory
as my hippocampus tissue is damaged.

224
00:24:23,770 --> 00:24:25,038
It's not very serious.

225
00:24:26,005 --> 00:24:28,575
I just forget some things
without taking notes.

226
00:24:28,575 --> 00:24:31,511
Don't worry. I'm being treated
and rehabilitated.

227
00:24:31,511 --> 00:24:32,912
I'll get better over time.

228
00:24:49,362 --> 00:24:52,098
In life,
there are numerous paths to take

229
00:24:52,098 --> 00:24:53,199
as long as you move forward.

230
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:57,303
Father, where did you get that line?
It's so corny.

231
00:24:57,871 --> 00:24:59,973
I worked very hard to find
this encouraging line.

232
00:25:01,674 --> 00:25:03,610
What are your plans?

233
00:25:04,777 --> 00:25:08,047
I'm thinking about
opening a dessert shop.

234
00:25:08,314 --> 00:25:09,582
A dessert shop?

235
00:25:10,049 --> 00:25:11,184
You can do it?

236
00:25:12,051 --> 00:25:14,387
I've learned to make a variety
of cakes and desserts,

237
00:25:14,387 --> 00:25:16,856
and I also have a baking certificate.
I've long considered opening a shop.

238
00:25:17,957 --> 00:25:20,360
I'd like to open a dessert shop
in downtown Taichung.

239
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:22,061
It sounds good.

240
00:25:22,795 --> 00:25:24,063
I'd like to show you something.

241
00:25:24,063 --> 00:25:24,931
Okay.

242
00:25:28,902 --> 00:25:30,003
Look at this.

243
00:25:31,871 --> 00:25:33,306
These are all painted by you?

244
00:25:33,306 --> 00:25:34,941
They look super delicious.

245
00:25:34,941 --> 00:25:36,543
And they have been actually made.

246
00:25:36,543 --> 00:25:37,577
Is there more?

247
00:25:38,545 --> 00:25:41,447
At the beginning,
you will need three eggs.

248
00:25:41,447 --> 00:25:43,416
Then 50 grams of milk,

249
00:25:43,416 --> 00:25:44,617
and 35 grams of vegetable oil...

250
00:25:45,451 --> 00:25:47,053
The notes are very detailed.

251
00:25:47,587 --> 00:25:49,822
- This looks so delicious too.
- After all, I'm a top student.

252
00:26:13,813 --> 00:26:16,049
Mr. Yi, someone's been
picking on Ai Di in a bar.

253
00:26:28,061 --> 00:26:29,062

- Sorry.

270

It's a miracle
when the person you like also likes you.

271
00:27:56,315 --> 00:27:58,418
A miracle doesn't happen
just by hoping for it.
