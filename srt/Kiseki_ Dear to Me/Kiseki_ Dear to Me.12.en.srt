=KISEKI: Dear To Me=
=Episode 12=

18
00:01:24,099 --> 00:01:25,767
So yummy!

19
00:01:27,369 --> 00:01:29,071
Right? I told you so.

20
00:01:29,071 --> 00:01:30,739
If I say it's delicious,
it genuinely is.

21
00:01:30,739 --> 00:01:32,107
Worth introducing, right?

22
00:01:32,674 --> 00:01:33,542
Definitely.

23
00:01:33,875 --> 00:01:35,440
And the shop owner is handsome.

24
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:37,045
Here, enjoy your food.

25
00:01:37,913 --> 00:01:40,449
Can we shoot a video in your shop?

26
00:01:41,049 --> 00:01:41,883
Certainly.

27
00:01:41,883 --> 00:01:42,651
With your support,

28
00:01:42,651 --> 00:01:44,052
my shop's business will surely improve.

29
00:01:44,052 --> 00:01:44,920
Absolutely.

30
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,888
We only recommend good stuff.

31
00:01:47,122 --> 00:01:48,490
Go ahead. Think of something special.

32
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:49,958
No problem.

33
00:01:49,958 --> 00:01:52,727
How about we start with Strawberry Day?

34
00:01:53,228 --> 00:01:55,664
I remember you mentioning
there is a story behind it.

35
00:01:55,931 --> 00:01:56,932
What story?

36
00:01:57,232 --> 00:01:58,166
I'd like to know too.

37
00:01:58,166 --> 00:01:59,301
They must have made it up.

38
00:01:59,835 --> 00:02:02,871
I heard the person the shop owner loves
enjoys strawberries.

39
00:02:02,871 --> 00:02:04,606
So he designed Strawberry Day for him.

40
00:02:04,606 --> 00:02:07,275
Only strawberry-flavored cakes
are offered

41
00:02:07,275 --> 00:02:08,310
on that day to make him happy.

42
00:02:09,177 --> 00:02:10,846
It's not an ordinary story.

43
00:02:10,846 --> 00:02:12,681
It's purely romantic.

44
00:02:12,681 --> 00:02:14,015
Sir, you're really good at this.

45
00:02:14,616 --> 00:02:16,017
The person you love

46
00:02:16,017 --> 00:02:17,652
must be very lucky.

47
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,554
Yes,

48
00:02:19,554 --> 00:02:20,489
he is.

49
00:02:22,224 --> 00:02:23,558
Excuse us. Please enjoy your food.

50
00:02:23,558 --> 00:02:24,759
Okay.

51
00:02:26,328 --> 00:02:27,295
It's him, right?

52
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:29,498
The person the shop owner loves.

53
00:02:29,498 --> 00:02:30,532
I think so too.

54
00:02:33,468 --> 00:02:34,736
What brings you here today?

55
00:02:35,504 --> 00:02:36,538
To help you.

56
00:02:36,538 --> 00:02:38,473
And to recharge at the same time.

57
00:02:47,949 --> 00:02:49,718
Are you recharged?

58
00:02:52,888 --> 00:02:54,189
10 percent.

59
00:02:57,792 --> 00:03:00,262
How about now?

60
00:03:02,464 --> 00:03:03,331
15 percent.

61
00:03:04,065 --> 00:03:06,134
This charger isn't very good.
It's a bit slow.

62
00:03:07,269 --> 00:03:08,436
So we should use a docked charger.

63
00:03:10,205 --> 00:03:11,606
Come have dinner at my place tonight.

64
00:03:14,676 --> 00:03:16,011
Give me a little more time.

65
00:03:17,112 --> 00:03:19,414
I'm not ready
to face your father and Jingyu.

66
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:26,054
It's okay. Take your time.

67
00:03:27,322 --> 00:03:28,723
I'll wait for you.

68
00:03:30,692 --> 00:03:31,860
Thank you.

69
00:03:39,134 --> 00:03:40,502
What's this again?

70
00:03:40,502 --> 00:03:41,603
I don't know.

71
00:03:41,603 --> 00:03:42,671
Mr. Yi prepared this himself.

72
00:03:52,247 --> 00:03:53,048
This...

73
00:03:56,218 --> 00:03:57,319
This...

74
00:04:01,656 --> 00:04:03,525
I'm not a gangster anymore.
Why is he giving me these?

75
00:04:10,398 --> 00:04:12,901
(Come back. Chen Yi)

76
00:04:15,737 --> 00:04:18,139
Tell him to stop doing such things

77
00:04:21,476 --> 00:04:23,078
and focus on what he needs to do.

78
00:04:23,078 --> 00:04:24,879
How can he focus when you're not there?

79
00:04:25,213 --> 00:04:26,815
I've been around you two for long.

80
00:04:27,115 --> 00:04:28,917
I can tell
that Mr. Yi really cares about you.

81
00:04:29,251 --> 00:04:30,452
He loves you.

82
00:04:31,353 --> 00:04:32,687
Are you blind?

83
00:04:33,455 --> 00:04:34,456
Don't talk nonsense, okay?

84
00:04:34,456 --> 00:04:36,324
It's true. I'm not talking nonsense.

85
00:04:36,992 --> 00:04:38,426
I thought I might be wrong.

86
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,829
But after Mr. Yi visited you
in prison that year,

87
00:04:41,363 --> 00:04:42,297
he changed.

88
00:04:45,533 --> 00:04:47,202
Just say what you want to say.

89
00:04:52,173 --> 00:04:54,542
I'm sorry
for only coming to see you now.

90
00:05:06,054 --> 00:05:07,389
What's this?

91
00:05:26,374 --> 00:05:27,509
Happy birthday.

92
00:05:32,514 --> 00:05:34,949
What are you doing?

93
00:05:35,483 --> 00:05:36,518
We made a promise

94
00:05:37,652 --> 00:05:38,953
to celebrate each other's birthdays

95
00:05:39,354 --> 00:05:40,655
and surviving another year.

96
00:05:41,323 --> 00:05:42,557
Buddy.

97
00:05:44,059 --> 00:05:45,460
Since your 17th birthday,

98
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:46,928
we haven't celebrated like this.

99
00:05:48,296 --> 00:05:50,198
What? Did the lightning strike you?

100
00:05:52,067 --> 00:05:54,102
Or does my being in jail
jog your memory?

101
00:05:54,202 --> 00:05:55,603
I failed to keep our promise.

102
00:05:57,105 --> 00:05:58,506
A promise?

103
00:06:00,108 --> 00:06:01,509
A promise is nothing.

104
00:06:03,645 --> 00:06:06,181
You should celebrate the birthday
with the one you love.

105
00:06:08,216 --> 00:06:09,884
Why waste your time on me?

106
00:06:11,553 --> 00:06:14,622
You've delivered the cake
and lit the candles. I'm leaving.

107
00:06:15,757 --> 00:06:19,427
(CHEN YI 1998.2.5)

108
00:06:46,688 --> 00:06:47,655
So what?

109
00:06:49,424 --> 00:06:51,659
If you hadn't mentioned it,
I'd have totally forgotten it.

110
00:06:53,895 --> 00:06:55,163
Don't come again.

111
00:06:58,767 --> 00:07:00,301
Just throw this thing away.

112
00:07:01,503 --> 00:07:02,837
There's no point in keeping it.

113
00:07:04,506 --> 00:07:05,507
It's all in the past.

114
00:07:17,819 --> 00:07:20,555
I'm really serious.

115
00:07:22,157 --> 00:07:24,692
After he visited you that time,
he became very moody.

116
00:07:26,261 --> 00:07:27,028
That's how he is.

117
00:07:27,495 --> 00:07:28,897
Not that moody.

118
00:07:28,897 --> 00:07:30,298
In short, he is different.

119
00:07:31,933 --> 00:07:32,867
Come back.

120
00:07:33,401 --> 00:07:34,903
Even if it's temporary.

121
00:07:36,037 --> 00:07:37,806
Boss wants Mr. Yi to take over.

122
00:07:37,806 --> 00:07:39,040
Those old ones keep making messes.

123
00:07:39,674 --> 00:07:41,009
Now he has to worry about you too.

124
00:07:42,844 --> 00:07:44,279
Did I ask him to worry about me?

125
00:07:45,914 --> 00:07:48,316
Go back and tell him
that instead of wasting time on me,

126
00:07:48,583 --> 00:07:50,518
he should spend some time
bringing yourselves up.

127
00:07:52,654 --> 00:07:53,655
Stand on your own.

128
00:07:54,289 --> 00:07:56,291
Don't disgrace him, understand?

129
00:07:58,927 --> 00:08:00,261
Come back to help Mr. Yi.

130
00:08:01,629 --> 00:08:03,431
He really wants you back.

131
00:08:04,165 --> 00:08:06,601
Otherwise, he wouldn't keep bothering
you about the issue of Zhang Teng.

132
00:08:08,736 --> 00:08:09,804
What does that mean?

133
00:08:12,173 --> 00:08:12,944
Did he lie to me?

134
00:08:12,944 --> 00:08:15,310
Well, if you want to know,
you'll have to ask him yourself.

135
00:08:38,633 --> 00:08:39,501
Zherui.

136
00:08:41,836 --> 00:08:42,837
Mr. Bai.

137
00:08:48,409 --> 00:08:49,010
You came to see Zongyi?

138
00:08:49,477 --> 00:08:51,346
Yes... No.

139
00:08:52,347 --> 00:08:54,415
You can be honest with me.

140
00:08:54,983 --> 00:08:56,084
Are you here for him or not?

141
00:08:56,584 --> 00:08:57,252
Yes.

142
00:08:59,487 --> 00:09:00,054
Alright.

143
00:09:01,322 --> 00:09:02,357
I won't go then.

144
00:09:03,124 --> 00:09:04,926
After he closes the shop,
you help check the accounts.

145
00:09:06,027 --> 00:09:06,694
Okay.

146
00:09:11,566 --> 00:09:12,367
Mr. Bai.

147
00:09:22,677 --> 00:09:23,344
Can I...

148
00:09:24,979 --> 00:09:27,115
Can I really stay by Zongyi's side?

149
00:09:28,616 --> 00:09:30,518
I know I'm very thick-skinned
for doing this.

150
00:09:30,518 --> 00:09:31,953
I've done something that failed you.

151
00:09:31,953 --> 00:09:32,854
I caused Zongyi...

152
00:09:32,854 --> 00:09:33,888
Don't apologize.

153
00:09:38,793 --> 00:09:40,995
The person who has the most right
to blame you is Zongyi.

154
00:09:43,298 --> 00:09:45,099
But since he chooses to be with you,

155
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:47,001
you should hold your head high.

156
00:09:49,103 --> 00:09:50,605
Only then can you
live up to his sacrifice.

157
00:09:56,477 --> 00:09:57,912
I will try

158
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:00,515
to consider you as my other son.

159
00:10:05,753 --> 00:10:07,255
Come home with Zongyi today.

160
00:10:08,623 --> 00:10:09,824
Can I really come?

161
00:10:10,692 --> 00:10:11,693
He has prepared

162
00:10:12,026 --> 00:10:13,728
the bowl and chopsticks for you,

163
00:10:16,297 --> 00:10:17,665
waiting for you to come home with him.

164
00:10:48,329 --> 00:10:49,564
Are you ready?

165
00:10:51,866 --> 00:10:52,967
We're home.

166
00:10:54,068 --> 00:10:55,436
Zherui.

167
00:10:55,436 --> 00:10:56,938
Father, Zherui is here.

168
00:10:59,007 --> 00:10:59,807
Jingyu.

169
00:10:59,807 --> 00:11:00,875
Zherui, it's been a while.

170
00:11:00,875 --> 00:11:01,709
It's good to see you.

171
00:11:03,778 --> 00:11:04,879
Zherui, you are here.

172
00:11:06,481 --> 00:11:07,815
Sorry for the disturbance, Mr. Bai.

173
00:11:08,316 --> 00:11:10,318
Not at all. Have a seat.

174
00:11:11,285 --> 00:11:12,086
Come.

175
00:11:12,353 --> 00:11:14,288
Zherui, my brother is over the top.

176
00:11:14,288 --> 00:11:15,623
He bought chopsticks
and bowl last month,

177
00:11:15,623 --> 00:11:17,625
and he nearly worshiped them,
not letting anyone touch them.

178
00:11:17,859 --> 00:11:19,494
Bai Jingyu, you're really annoying.

179
00:11:20,428 --> 00:11:22,797
I'm telling the truth.
Who else does that?

180
00:11:22,797 --> 00:11:24,232
Alright, never mind.

181
00:11:24,232 --> 00:11:26,901
Let's eat together. Come.

182
00:11:27,235 --> 00:11:28,069
Thank you, Mr. Bai.

183
00:11:28,703 --> 00:11:29,871
You're welcome.

184
00:11:29,871 --> 00:11:31,105
Make yourself at home.

185
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:35,143
I hope you like this simple meal.

186
00:11:35,143 --> 00:11:35,977
It's plentiful.

187
00:11:36,711 --> 00:11:37,145
Come on.

188
00:11:37,145 --> 00:11:38,379
Zherui, eat up.

189
00:11:38,379 --> 00:11:39,180
Okay.

190
00:11:39,514 --> 00:11:41,416
Well, I forgot to ask if you eat shrimp.

191
00:11:41,416 --> 00:11:42,083
I do.

192
00:11:42,316 --> 00:11:44,752
I didn't ask Zongyi
if you are allergic to shrimp.

193
00:11:44,752 --> 00:11:45,787
Shrimp is my favorite.

194
00:11:45,987 --> 00:11:47,021
Come on.

195
00:11:47,021 --> 00:11:49,357
Eat more if you like.

196
00:11:50,024 --> 00:11:51,426
Have one.

197
00:12:13,214 --> 00:12:14,949
Why are you laughing?

198
00:12:14,949 --> 00:12:16,417
You can still laugh
even when you're tied up?

199
00:12:21,422 --> 00:12:24,292
Tell me. What's with
Zhang Teng's retaliation?

200
00:12:24,859 --> 00:12:27,161
Tell me. Otherwise, I'll make you
suffer from the spicy food.

201
00:12:47,448 --> 00:12:48,249
It can't be.

202
00:12:50,151 --> 00:12:51,552
When did you start eating spicy food?

203
00:12:52,386 --> 00:12:54,355
I said I'd be serious next time.

204
00:12:57,558 --> 00:12:59,861
Touch me again, and I will kill you.

205
00:13:01,162 --> 00:13:02,497
Let go of me!

206
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:04,832
Let go of me!

207
00:13:06,234 --> 00:13:08,202
Untie the rope,
and I can leave you half-dead.

208
00:13:08,503 --> 00:13:10,605
If you don't, I'll kill you.

209
00:13:10,605 --> 00:13:11,539
Should I be scared?

210
00:13:11,973 --> 00:13:13,508
You've already decided to leave me.

211
00:13:13,508 --> 00:13:15,209
No matter what I do,
you don't want to come back.

212
00:13:16,978 --> 00:13:19,113
What do I have to do
for you to believe in me?

213
00:13:21,182 --> 00:13:22,750
Don't tell me
it was when I was in prison

214
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:24,552
that you realized you like me.

215
00:13:26,621 --> 00:13:27,855
If I say

216
00:13:29,757 --> 00:13:31,125
it was after you left

217
00:13:32,426 --> 00:13:34,495
that I realized
who I really like is you,

218
00:13:38,699 --> 00:13:40,101
will you come back to me?

219
00:13:44,539 --> 00:13:46,774
Don't use me as a substitute
when you can't get the one you like.

220
00:13:49,844 --> 00:13:51,179
I knew it was you that night.

221
00:14:01,022 --> 00:14:02,690
I still remember the words you said.

222
00:14:07,628 --> 00:14:09,564
I thought about it for as long
as you were in prison.

223
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:13,034
I asked myself why I didn't notice.

224
00:14:17,438 --> 00:14:18,773
We had never been apart for so long.

225
00:14:20,274 --> 00:14:22,476
I found the birthday gifts
you left for me in the room

226
00:14:23,411 --> 00:14:25,012
for my 18th to 21st birthdays.

227
00:14:50,071 --> 00:14:51,105
Shut up.

228
00:14:55,843 --> 00:14:56,777
I started to imagine

229
00:14:57,678 --> 00:14:59,113
what you were doing at that time.

230
00:15:03,184 --> 00:15:04,852
Would you celebrate my birthday
by yourself?

231
00:15:16,731 --> 00:15:20,968
Happy birthday to you.

232
00:15:23,237 --> 00:15:27,475
Happy birthday to you.

233
00:15:29,644 --> 00:15:33,881
Happy birthday to you.

234
00:15:36,304 --> 00:15:39,440
Happy birthday to me.

235
00:15:59,774 --> 00:16:01,275
Celebrate my birthday
with me this year, okay?

236
00:16:05,246 --> 00:16:06,147
I don't want to.

237
00:16:08,816 --> 00:16:10,918
You said birthdays should be
celebrated with the one I like.

238
00:16:13,888 --> 00:16:14,855
I like you.

239
00:16:22,797 --> 00:16:24,432
I want to celebrate my birthday with you

240
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:26,067
this year, next year,

241
00:16:27,468 --> 00:16:28,769
and every year after.

242
00:16:30,171 --> 00:16:31,505
As long as I'm alive.

243
00:16:33,808 --> 00:16:35,209
I just want to be with you.

244
00:16:47,788 --> 00:16:48,956
You better think it through.

245
00:16:50,558 --> 00:16:51,892
What's mine will always be mine.

246
00:16:52,994 --> 00:16:54,428
I won't give it to anyone.

247
00:16:58,332 --> 00:16:59,133
Me too.

248
00:16:59,967 --> 00:17:01,268
Whoever tries to steal it will die.

249
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:04,905
No wonder
I dislike the customers at your bar.

250
00:17:15,449 --> 00:17:16,450
Are you really Chen Yi?

251
00:17:19,053 --> 00:17:20,087
Am I not dreaming?

252
00:17:25,893 --> 00:17:26,961

Excuse me, an iced Americano.

277
00:20:17,798 --> 00:20:18,799
Did you make this?

278
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,134
How did you know?

279
00:20:21,969 --> 00:20:23,671
Because the shop owner
is very good at making cakes.

280
00:20:24,071 --> 00:20:26,207
So this one should be made by you.

281
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:29,276
I've been learning this for a month.

282
00:20:30,344 --> 00:20:32,179
You've been protecting me
since we were little.

283
00:20:32,179 --> 00:20:33,814
I want to do something for you.

284
00:20:34,515 --> 00:20:35,649
Forget it. I'll eat it myself.

285
00:20:41,288 --> 00:20:42,489
Are you angry?

286
00:21:01,575 --> 00:21:03,110
You made this for me.

287
00:21:03,344 --> 00:21:04,912
Of course, I will eat it.

288
00:21:06,647 --> 00:21:07,481
Let's eat together.

289
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:21,495
Does your dessert shop
also provide teaching services?

290
00:21:21,929 --> 00:21:23,497
He asked me to do it.

291
00:21:24,531 --> 00:21:26,233
You were in prison,
and you're still soft-hearted.

292
00:21:28,235 --> 00:21:30,371
Is this your secret weapon
for tomorrow night?

293
00:21:32,306 --> 00:21:33,874
Well, proposing like this

294
00:21:34,608 --> 00:21:35,909
is quite your style.

295
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:38,479
I'll also make one for you and Chen Yi
on your birthday.

296
00:21:39,413 --> 00:21:40,514
Please, don't.

297
00:21:40,781 --> 00:21:42,750
He eats like a snake
that swallows an egg.

298
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:44,151
He doesn't even chew.

299
00:21:44,151 --> 00:21:45,519
I'm afraid he will swallow the ring.

300
00:21:46,153 --> 00:21:47,388
But I shall make a cake to thank him

301
00:21:47,388 --> 00:21:48,756
for sending people to protect us.

302
00:21:55,396 --> 00:21:57,298
You mentioned something
about Zhang Teng...

303
00:21:57,564 --> 00:21:59,366
Speaking of that, actually,

304
00:22:01,101 --> 00:22:04,138
the matter about Zhang Teng is a lie
made up by Chen Yi to gain my attention.

305
00:22:04,571 --> 00:22:05,339
It's not true?

306
00:22:08,142 --> 00:22:09,977
Sorry for making you worry unnecessarily
these days.

307
00:22:13,213 --> 00:22:14,515
In fact,

308
00:22:15,516 --> 00:22:17,418
Chen Yi has never said that,

309
00:22:17,718 --> 00:22:19,553
but I know he has always
felt guilty towards you

310
00:22:21,155 --> 00:22:22,723
for making you take the blame for Rui.

311
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:27,161
What's wrong?

312
00:22:30,097 --> 00:22:30,898
Don't use your hands.

313
00:22:36,870 --> 00:22:38,839
It slipped out of my hand. Sorry.

314
00:22:39,473 --> 00:22:41,675
It's okay. Are your hands alright?

315
00:22:44,011 --> 00:22:45,979
I'm glad you're not injured. Be careful.

316
00:22:45,979 --> 00:22:47,314
I will take these to the dumpster.

317
00:22:47,314 --> 00:22:48,015
Okay.

318
00:22:49,683 --> 00:22:51,118
You're busy. I'll leave now.

319
00:22:51,118 --> 00:22:51,919
Ai Di,

320
00:22:52,886 --> 00:22:54,555
tell Chen Yi to stop by
whenever he has time.

321
00:22:54,822 --> 00:22:56,390
I will invite him for coffee and cake.

322
00:22:57,458 --> 00:22:59,159
Prepare more cakes then.

323
00:22:59,159 --> 00:23:01,095
Tell him it's your treat,
and I will pay the bill.

324
00:23:01,628 --> 00:23:02,863
He likes to eat sweets so much?

325
00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:04,331
He hates sweets the most.

326
00:23:04,331 --> 00:23:06,266
We are here at a shop
that sells super-tasty desserts.

327
00:23:06,266 --> 00:23:08,435
It's called Tiramomo.

328
00:23:08,435 --> 00:23:10,504
- What are they doing?
- The owner is very handsome.

329
00:23:10,504 --> 00:23:11,305
Really?

330
00:23:11,305 --> 00:23:12,306
Really. Let's go.

331
00:23:12,306 --> 00:23:13,640
Let's go in and see.

332
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:14,708
Let's go.

333
00:23:15,442 --> 00:23:18,712
Hi. I came with my friends.

334
00:23:18,712 --> 00:23:20,280
He is really handsome!

335
00:23:21,248 --> 00:23:24,118
Do you have any special cakes today?

336
00:23:24,585 --> 00:23:25,886
Today is Strawberry Day.

337
00:23:26,487 --> 00:23:28,989
So I prepared
a series of strawberry desserts.

338
00:23:28,989 --> 00:23:30,691
I hope you will like them.

339
00:23:30,691 --> 00:23:32,559
Why is there a Strawberry Day?

340
00:23:33,427 --> 00:23:34,495
Because

341
00:23:35,195 --> 00:23:37,931
the one I love likes strawberries.

342
00:23:37,931 --> 00:23:40,467
So romantic!

343
00:23:41,068 --> 00:23:42,703
How long have you two been together?

344
00:23:43,704 --> 00:23:46,640
We've actually been together
for less than a year.

345
00:23:47,875 --> 00:23:50,043
But we've been loving each other
for almost five years.

346
00:23:50,043 --> 00:23:52,746
What's your recommendation today?

347
00:23:53,347 --> 00:23:55,048
This is our
new strawberry mille-feuille.

348
00:23:55,215 --> 00:23:56,417
You might want to give it a try.

349
00:23:57,451 --> 00:23:58,585
It looks so delicious.

350
00:23:58,585 --> 00:24:00,754
The one next to it seems delicious too.

351
00:24:00,754 --> 00:24:02,122
That's a strawberry tart.

352
00:24:02,956 --> 00:24:04,124
Are you here to pick me up?

353
00:24:04,992 --> 00:24:06,293
Will you go back to the bar or gang?

354
00:24:07,127 --> 00:24:07,995
The bar.

355
00:24:08,695 --> 00:24:09,730
You're not coming back?

356
00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:10,964
What's the point of that?

357
00:24:11,432 --> 00:24:13,500
Isn't it good
to keep some distance sometimes?

358
00:24:17,337 --> 00:24:18,138
