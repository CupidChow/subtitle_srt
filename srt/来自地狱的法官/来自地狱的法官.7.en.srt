I'm sorry.

00:01:55,202 --> 00:01:56,203
I'm so...

00:01:58,205 --> 00:02:00,415
I'm so shocked

No, it's all right.

Well...

32
00:02:06,338 --> 00:02:08,131
Compared to me, his height was...

33
00:02:09,299 --> 00:02:12,385
He was about this tall.

34
00:02:12,886 --> 00:02:13,887
Okay.

35
00:02:14,387 --> 00:02:17,599
The knife he was holding
was quite unusual.

The blade was...

00:02:20,101 --> 00:02:21,353
a bit...

00:02:21,436 --> 00:02:22,437
Well...

00:02:22,521 --> 00:02:24,147
Do you think you could

00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:27,526
draw the knife you remember here?

41
00:02:27,609 --> 00:02:28,610
[Jeongim] Yes.

42
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,039

50
00:03:31,214 --> 00:03:33,758
{\an8}I'll make him some
this evening at the camp site.

51
00:03:36,678 --> 00:03:38,805
{\an8}I'm sure it breaks your hearts.

52
00:03:39,389 --> 00:03:42,893
{\an8}That he still can't really
enjoy his birthday.

53
00:03:43,476 --> 00:03:46,438
{\an8}It's been long enough
that he should be able to. Right?

54
00:03:48,607 --> 00:03:50,817
{\an8}As his parents,

55
00:03:50,901 --> 00:03:53,028
{\an8}I'm sure you'd want Daon to be happy.

56
00:03:53,612 --> 00:03:58,325
But that dummy still doesn't know that.
[chuckles]

57
00:04:03,246 --> 00:04:04,581
[Daon] You should've told me.

58
00:04:04,664 --> 00:04:07,959
Hey. You're the one
who should have told me.

59
00:04:08,043 --> 00:04:09,461
We could've come together.

60
00:04:10,837 --> 00:04:12,339
I'm glad you're here. [chuckles]

61
00:04:13,798 --> 00:04:17,802
{\an8}Don't worry, ma'am.
I'll take good care of your son.

62
00:04:19,262 --> 00:04:21,515
[Donghun] There are three victims in total
as of now.

63
00:04:21,598 --> 00:04:24,518
Clues left behind
are the engravings on the forehead

64
00:04:25,352 --> 00:04:27,229
and the abdominal stab wounds.

65
00:04:27,896 --> 00:04:31,733
We looked into all iron manufacturing
companies in the country.

66
00:04:31,816 --> 00:04:34,069
But none made this kind of thing.

67
00:04:34,152 --> 00:04:36,947
Oh, right. The case in Hwangcheon...

68
00:04:40,158 --> 00:04:43,370
Also, the crimes only took place
where there were

69
00:04:43,453 --> 00:04:45,789
no security cameras
or where they were broken.

70
00:04:45,872 --> 00:04:47,999
And judging by the fact,

71
00:04:48,083 --> 00:04:49,459
they seem very meticulous.

72
00:04:49,543 --> 00:04:50,794
Any evidence?

73
00:04:51,628 --> 00:04:52,921
None yet.

74
00:04:53,004 --> 00:04:56,049
But we'll find it soon. We will.

75
00:04:56,132 --> 00:04:58,468
Oh, right. About Judge Kang Bitna,

76
00:04:58,552 --> 00:05:01,388
do you know she's getting
a lot of criticism online

77
00:05:01,471 --> 00:05:03,265
for acquitting Yang Seungbin?

78
00:05:03,348 --> 00:05:05,809
EVEN MY DOG WOULD BE A BETTER JUDGE
THAN KANG BITNA

00:05:05,892 --> 00:05:08,895

in the hopes that you'll do better...

86

Are you listening to me?

87
00:05:33,128 --> 00:05:34,212
No.

88
00:05:35,255 --> 00:05:36,256

herself to understand."

00:05:45,682 --> 00:05:48,810
These are the comments
posted to the articles on this ruling.

93
00:05:48,894 --> 00:05:50,353
What do you have to say?

94
00:05:50,437 --> 00:05:51,563
[Judge Kang] Nothing.

95
00:05:52,105 --> 00:05:54,941
[scoffs] Maybe you do have a conscience.

96
00:05:55,025 --> 00:05:57,819
What's wrong is wrong,
even if Assemblyman Jeong asked for it.

97
00:05:57,903 --> 00:06:01,406
I can never put you
on a case like this again.

98
00:06:01,489 --> 00:06:04,326
-So go back to the single-judge court.
-Okay.

99
00:06:05,243 --> 00:06:06,828
Why aren't you talking back today?

100
00:06:07,412 --> 00:06:09,080
-Should I?
-No.

101
00:06:09,956 --> 00:06:12,292
I'll get going
if that's all you have to say.

102
00:06:18,256 --> 00:06:21,343
Her compliance is even more unsettling.
[sighs]

103
00:06:23,011 --> 00:06:24,596
What's up with her?

104
00:06:28,016 --> 00:06:29,267
Did you get an earful?

105
00:06:29,351 --> 00:06:30,852
Gosh, I knew it.

106
00:06:30,936 --> 00:06:34,439
Your conscience is dead if you expect
no backlash after that ruling.

107
00:06:34,523 --> 00:06:36,775
There are so many malicious comments now.

108
00:06:36,858 --> 00:06:40,320
-You wrote one too, didn't you?
-Of course, I... [chuckles nervously]

111
00:06:45,867 --> 00:06:47,285
There's something important.

112
00:06:48,286 --> 00:06:51,414
What do you think about the rumor?
The one I told you last time

113
00:06:51,498 --> 00:06:53,375
about Arong being Satan.

114
00:06:54,501 --> 00:06:55,794
Arong? Satan?

115
00:06:55,877 --> 00:06:56,920
[Mando] <i>It's true.</i>

116
00:06:57,003 --> 00:07:00,632
<i>Something's unsettling about her eyes.
It's not just her bad temper.</i>

117
00:07:00,715 --> 00:07:04,302
Her eyes always look a bit crazy,
even when she's not angry.

118
00:07:04,886 --> 00:07:06,972
I'm sure she'll soon show her true self.

119
00:07:07,055 --> 00:07:09,724
When will you stop this nonsense?
I'll cover my ears.

120
00:07:10,475 --> 00:07:11,685
I'm sure of it!

121
00:07:11,768 --> 00:07:13,395
Wait, Justitia.

122
00:07:13,478 --> 00:07:15,564
Did you see the landlady's message?

123
00:07:15,647 --> 00:07:18,525
She wants all the residents
to hike together this weekend.

124
00:07:18,608 --> 00:07:20,694
To foster a sense of unity. Are you going?

125
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:24,239
Weekend, unity, hiking together.

126
00:07:24,322 --> 00:07:26,449
I don't like any of it. You go without me.

127
00:07:26,533 --> 00:07:27,909
-Nice.
-[knock on door]

128
00:07:29,411 --> 00:07:31,788
Judge Kang, are we going back
to single-judge court?

129
00:07:31,872 --> 00:07:33,039
-Yes...
-[Wongyeong] The sign out there

130
00:07:33,123 --> 00:07:35,000
-should be changed to this one.
-[Mando] Okay.

131
00:07:35,876 --> 00:07:36,960

00:07:37,544 --> 00:07:38,545

Damn it.

136
00:07:49,306 --> 00:07:50,724
I said come here, you shit.

00:07:55,478 --> 00:07:56,938
I don't have any money.

140
00:07:57,022 --> 00:08:00,025
If I find any on you, you're dead.

141
00:08:00,108 --> 00:08:01,359

142
00:08:01,443 --> 00:08:02,444
Hold still.

-[Dahui] No, not that. Stop.

00:08:08,491 --> 00:08:10,619
-Not that! Stop! [yells]
-You bitch!

-[both grunting]

00:08:15,957 --> 00:08:17,626
Thank you for saving me.

149
00:08:17,709 --> 00:08:19,878
No need for that.
I wasn't trying to help you.

150
00:08:19,961 --> 00:08:21,713
-What?
-Who are you, lady?

151
00:08:21,796 --> 00:08:24,174
You don't need to know. Pick up the trash.

152
00:08:24,257 --> 00:08:27,969
Just be on your way
if you don't want to get messed up.

153
00:08:28,053 --> 00:08:30,096
I'm not in a very good mood these days.

154
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:31,681
Pick it up, or else.

155
00:08:31,765 --> 00:08:33,183
Or what are you going to do?

156
00:08:34,059 --> 00:08:35,310
What are you going to do?

I warned you. You should've picked it up.

Why are kids these days so rude?

00:08:50,784 --> 00:08:52,410

00:09:37,205 --> 00:09:39,916
I mean,
they were extorting money from her.

179
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,459
And she saved her.

180
00:09:41,543 --> 00:09:44,963
But in the process, she used violence.

181
00:09:45,589 --> 00:09:47,132
[woman 1] If they lay another hand...

182
00:09:47,215 --> 00:09:49,843
-Goodness, my daughter...
-Who did this to you?

183
00:09:49,926 --> 00:09:51,052
Did you hit my kid?

184
00:09:51,136 --> 00:09:52,470
No. I disciplined her.

185
00:09:52,554 --> 00:09:54,931
Hey! You can't talk to me like that!

186
00:09:55,682 --> 00:09:57,475
You started it.

187
00:09:58,018 --> 00:09:59,311
Who the hell is she?

188
00:09:59,936 --> 00:10:02,564
-I want to sue that woman for assault.
-Me too.

189
00:10:03,148 --> 00:10:04,191
Like mother, like daughter.

190
00:10:04,274 --> 00:10:06,902
Then I will sue them, too.

191
00:10:07,402 --> 00:10:09,738
They shoved me and stole from me first.

192
00:10:09,821 --> 00:10:12,991
Seems like it was
just a prank between kids.

193
00:10:13,074 --> 00:10:15,785
But an adult stepped in and hit them!

194
00:10:16,661 --> 00:10:21,374
[laughs] I assumed they weren't
being properly disciplined at home.

195
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:24,002
-And seeing you, it all makes sense.
-[woman 1] What?

196
00:10:24,085 --> 00:10:27,088
Let's see if you stay that cocky
in front of a judge.

197
00:10:27,172 --> 00:10:28,798
-Ma'am?
-Yes?

198
00:10:29,382 --> 00:10:30,550
She is a judge.

199
00:10:30,634 --> 00:10:32,385
-What?
-She's a judge.

200
00:10:35,138 --> 00:10:37,849
Should we include school violence, too?

201
00:10:39,309 --> 00:10:41,269
I can't believe you!

202
00:10:41,353 --> 00:10:42,562
[Judge Kang] If this is over, can I go?

203
00:10:42,646 --> 00:10:43,647
Yes, of course.

204
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:48,276
Let's not run into each other again.

205
00:10:52,531 --> 00:10:54,866
[woman 2] We can't even speak up
because of school violence.

206
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:56,535
I can't believe you.

207
00:10:58,286 --> 00:10:59,287
Let's go.

208
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:06,962
Mom.

209
00:11:08,088 --> 00:11:11,925
Should I say hello to your colleagues
and have dinner since I'm here?

210
00:11:13,093 --> 00:11:14,469
Why were you in Hwangcheon?

211
00:11:14,553 --> 00:11:16,680
I heard Daon got a place there.

212
00:11:16,763 --> 00:11:18,890
I was going to surprise him at his house.

213
00:11:18,974 --> 00:11:20,559
[Soyeong] Don't go
to that neighborhood again.

214
00:11:21,935 --> 00:11:24,396
Those girls won't be around anymore...

215
00:11:24,479 --> 00:11:26,147
Just don't go there!

216
00:11:29,568 --> 00:11:31,820
Why are you yelling?

217
00:11:33,196 --> 00:11:35,782
Those bad girls pushed me to the ground

218
00:11:35,866 --> 00:11:37,701
and took my money.

219
00:11:37,784 --> 00:11:40,412
You didn't even ask if I was okay.
You just yelled.

220
00:11:40,495 --> 00:11:41,746
Dahui, I'm just...

221
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:50,005
I'll go.

222
00:11:52,007 --> 00:11:53,008
Dahui!

223
00:11:56,261 --> 00:11:59,389
Thank you so much for helping my daughter.

224
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:01,933
I didn't really help her.

225
00:12:02,017 --> 00:12:03,351
You did.

226
00:12:03,435 --> 00:12:06,104
If those moms cause trouble, let me know.

227
00:12:06,188 --> 00:12:09,441
I will make sure
you're not inconvenienced.

228
00:12:10,025 --> 00:12:11,693
Thank you, Judge Kang.

229
00:12:33,006 --> 00:12:34,007
-[keypad beeping]
-[door opens]

230
00:12:37,594 --> 00:12:39,304
I was wondering when you might come.

231
00:12:40,305 --> 00:12:41,306
Come in.

232
00:12:45,852 --> 00:12:47,854
[Mija sighs]

233
00:12:59,741 --> 00:13:02,536
I know why you came to see me.

234
00:13:03,578 --> 00:13:05,747
I'm sure you were curious why I said

235
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:10,585
one of you would die if you and that woman
on the second floor stayed together.

236
00:13:10,669 --> 00:13:13,421
She already killed me once
and I came back to life.

237
00:13:13,505 --> 00:13:15,006
I know it sounds ridiculous.

238
00:13:16,174 --> 00:13:17,801
But she's a demon.

239
00:13:19,761 --> 00:13:22,806
You know about Judge Kang, don't you?

240
00:13:24,015 --> 00:13:25,851
Please tell me the truth.

241
00:13:25,934 --> 00:13:28,395
If you two stay together,

242
00:13:28,478 --> 00:13:32,190
one of you will die for sure.

243
00:13:32,858 --> 00:13:36,987
But there's still a chance
you might survive.

244
00:13:37,779 --> 00:13:39,531
That's the truth.

245
00:13:45,328 --> 00:13:47,747
I knew your parents well.

246
00:13:48,665 --> 00:13:51,209
They were such kind and just souls.

247
00:13:51,293 --> 00:13:52,669
They were poor,

248
00:13:53,545 --> 00:13:57,007
but their love for you was overflowing.

249
00:13:57,090 --> 00:14:01,678
It was unfortunate
they had to leave you so early.

250
00:14:02,888 --> 00:14:05,182
How do you know my parents?

251
00:14:06,224 --> 00:14:10,228
A long time ago,
someone asked me for a favor.

252
00:14:10,312 --> 00:14:13,064
To protect you no matter what.

253
00:14:13,648 --> 00:14:14,733
Was that...

254
00:14:15,984 --> 00:14:17,527
my parents?

255
00:14:17,611 --> 00:14:19,738
Leave this place at once.

256
00:14:19,821 --> 00:14:22,949
Never see that woman Kang Bitna again.

257
00:14:24,659 --> 00:14:25,827
Ma'am.

258
00:14:25,911 --> 00:14:30,457
Today, I kept my promise to them.

259
00:14:31,791 --> 00:14:34,085
Whether you live or die,

260
00:14:34,878 --> 00:14:36,004
that's your choice.

261
00:14:36,087 --> 00:14:38,089
[â™ª melancholy music playing]

262
00:14:44,513 --> 00:14:45,805
You should go now.

263
00:14:51,478 --> 00:14:53,480
[â™ª melancholy music continues]

264
00:15:35,647 --> 00:15:36,940
Aren't you going to thank me?

265
00:15:40,151 --> 00:15:43,572
I don't care for that stuff either,
but you seem too unappreciative.

266
00:15:43,655 --> 00:15:46,992
If I say thank you, will you admit it?

267
00:15:47,075 --> 00:15:50,912
If you're suspicious of me, bring proof.
I've been saying this over and over.

268
00:15:52,289 --> 00:15:53,790
Are you going hiking tomorrow?

269
00:15:53,874 --> 00:15:54,916
Yes.

270
00:15:56,042 --> 00:15:57,377
Then I won't go.

271
00:15:57,460 --> 00:16:00,463
I don't want to speak
with someone accusing me of murder

272
00:16:00,547 --> 00:16:02,382
without any proof of it.

273
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:05,051
HWANGCHEON VILLA

274
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:11,141
[buzzer beeping]

275
00:16:13,977 --> 00:16:16,229
Admit it? Admit what?

276
00:16:16,313 --> 00:16:18,857
I didn't kill Ko Yunseong.
What should I admit to?

277
00:16:19,816 --> 00:16:21,067
He doesn't know anything.

278
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:23,904
I hate Han Daon.

279
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:26,781
Damn it.

280
00:16:28,783 --> 00:16:31,286
[Myeongsuk] Are you okay, honey?
Don't you need more rest?

281
00:16:31,369 --> 00:16:33,455
Staying home alone is worse.

282
00:16:33,538 --> 00:16:35,665
It's better to be with everyone else.

283
00:16:35,749 --> 00:16:37,000
I'll protect you, Mom.

284
00:16:37,584 --> 00:16:38,710
Thanks, sweetie.

285
00:16:40,462 --> 00:16:43,173
By the way, just how sick is Unit 201

286
00:16:43,256 --> 00:16:45,133
that she's not joining us?

287
00:16:45,217 --> 00:16:47,636
I think she's not feeling well. Let's go.

288
00:16:47,719 --> 00:16:50,055
How sick is she? Did she faint again?

289
00:16:50,138 --> 00:16:52,224
She probably fainted and is sleeping.

290
00:16:52,307 --> 00:16:54,601
Wait. She's here.

291
00:16:54,684 --> 00:16:55,769
[Myeongsuk] What?

292
00:16:55,852 --> 00:16:56,978
Honey!

293
00:16:57,062 --> 00:16:59,314
I thought you were sick. What happened?

294
00:16:59,397 --> 00:17:00,524
I'm all better now.

295
00:17:01,107 --> 00:17:02,317
I'm glad you came.

296
00:17:02,734 --> 00:17:03,735
[Myeongsuk laughs]

297
00:17:04,569 --> 00:17:06,738
-Don't you want some?
-I'm fine.

298
00:17:06,821 --> 00:17:10,825
You should hydrate
as you start climbing up, you know?

299
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:14,120
Here.

300
00:17:18,583 --> 00:17:20,252
-Give me your bag.
-No need.

301
00:17:20,335 --> 00:17:21,628
I'm stronger than you.

302
00:17:22,754 --> 00:17:25,841
Are all humans fake like you?

303
00:17:25,924 --> 00:17:28,051
Suspicious of me
but pretending to be nice?

304
00:17:30,053 --> 00:17:32,973
Let's go that way.
There's a platform to walk on up ahead.

305
00:17:33,598 --> 00:17:36,768
No, the landlady and the old woman
in the basement went that way.

306
00:17:42,315 --> 00:17:43,984
[Mando] One, two, three.

307
00:17:44,067 --> 00:17:45,151
[Myeongsuk] Cheese!

308
00:17:45,235 --> 00:17:46,319
[Mando] I just got me.

309
00:17:47,571 --> 00:17:48,697
[people laughing]

310
00:17:49,364 --> 00:17:50,615
[Mando] Let's take it again.

311
00:17:57,122 --> 00:17:58,415
Let me ask you something.

312
00:17:59,207 --> 00:18:01,293
Why are you so suspicious of me?

313
00:18:01,877 --> 00:18:04,713
Do you know how insulting it is
to be accused like that?

314
00:18:05,547 --> 00:18:07,591
What kind of person are...

315
00:18:07,674 --> 00:18:10,218
I mean, what kind of demon are you?

316
00:18:11,386 --> 00:18:12,929
Sometimes, you're so evil.

317
00:18:13,513 --> 00:18:16,391
But sometimes, you're so kind.

318
00:18:17,726 --> 00:18:18,852
It's confusing.

319
00:18:19,978 --> 00:18:21,396
Then stop caring.

320
00:18:31,448 --> 00:18:32,574
Thanks for yesterday.

321
00:18:33,742 --> 00:18:36,786
I won't accept the appreciation.
It's past its expiry date.

322
00:18:38,205 --> 00:18:40,624
Dahui isn't my real sister.

323
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:46,046
My parents and younger sibling
died in an accident when I was ten.

324
00:18:48,048 --> 00:18:50,634
The people who took me in
when I was left alone

325
00:18:50,717 --> 00:18:51,968
are my parents now.

326
00:18:52,636 --> 00:18:54,638
And Dahui is their daughter.

327
00:18:54,721 --> 00:18:57,682
The three people you said you killed
when you were young...

328
00:18:57,766 --> 00:18:58,767
That's right.

329
00:18:59,976 --> 00:19:02,896
They died because of me. So I killed them.

330
00:19:03,647 --> 00:19:07,025
My dad, mom, and brother.

331
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:13,782
I don't know what happened,
but I know for certain

332
00:19:13,865 --> 00:19:16,368
that you did not kill your family.

333
00:19:17,702 --> 00:19:21,248
If you did,
you'd already be in Hell by now.

334
00:19:21,331 --> 00:19:23,416
That might have been better.

335
00:19:24,334 --> 00:19:27,879
[scoffs] Stop with the self-pity already.

336
00:19:29,422 --> 00:19:30,674
Look here, Detective.

337
00:19:31,258 --> 00:19:33,134
You did not kill them.

338
00:19:34,845 --> 00:19:38,223
Do you really believe it wasn't my fault?

339
00:19:38,306 --> 00:19:40,183
I don't believe. I know.

340
00:19:40,767 --> 00:19:43,770
You've never killed anyone. Ever.

341
00:19:48,233 --> 00:19:51,570
Gosh, it's so stressful
that you don't get it.

342
00:19:52,779 --> 00:19:53,905
[Daon] Just for today,

343
00:19:55,407 --> 00:19:56,783
I'd like to believe you.

344
00:19:57,659 --> 00:19:59,286
I'll try to.

345
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:02,998
Don't believe in me. That's idol worship.

346
00:20:09,629 --> 00:20:11,798
[Myeongsuk exclaims and laughs]

347
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:18,597
[exclaiming]

348
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:23,018
Okay! To Hwangcheon Villa's bright future!

349
00:20:23,101 --> 00:20:25,270
[all] Cheers!

350
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:29,065
[Myeongsuk] I have to go
pray in the morning.

351
00:20:31,276 --> 00:20:34,446
Goodness, you guys are gulping it.

352
00:20:35,572 --> 00:20:38,283
You guys sure can drink.

353
00:20:38,366 --> 00:20:40,160
[chuckling] Goodness, what's this?

354
00:20:42,078 --> 00:20:45,207
Here. Have some fruit, too.

355
00:20:45,999 --> 00:20:47,000
By the way,

356
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:50,045
Ms. Oh is so energetic.

357
00:20:50,128 --> 00:20:53,215
She already went out
with her handcart without eating.

358
00:20:53,298 --> 00:20:55,884
When people are dying, they stop eating.

359
00:20:55,967 --> 00:20:58,261
-I guess it's her time.
-Hey!

360
00:20:58,887 --> 00:21:02,349
If you're pretty,
your words should be too.

363
00:21:06,561 --> 00:21:09,940
Mando, thank you so much.

364
00:21:10,023 --> 00:21:12,651
If it weren't for you and Ms. Jang,

365
00:21:12,734 --> 00:21:14,194
I would've been in big trouble.

366
00:21:14,819 --> 00:21:15,820
Don't mention it.

367
00:21:15,904 --> 00:21:17,906
The meat is delicious. Thank you.

368
00:21:17,989 --> 00:21:21,117
I mean, we walked by
just in time that day.

369
00:21:21,201 --> 00:21:22,869
Thank the Lord!

370
00:21:22,953 --> 00:21:24,829
-Amen.
-Amen.

371
00:21:24,913 --> 00:21:27,207
Anyway, thank you both so much.

372
00:21:27,290 --> 00:21:28,750
I'm grateful, too.

373
00:21:29,751 --> 00:21:31,586
Thank you for saving my mom.

374
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:34,464
At least you know when to say thank you

375
00:21:34,548 --> 00:21:36,049
before it's too late.

376
00:21:37,926 --> 00:21:39,761
Ah. Never mind.

377
00:21:39,845 --> 00:21:42,764
I said that for someone else's benefit,
but he's too drunk.

378

[others laughing]

379

Gosh, you know
you really have a way with your words.

380
00:21:48,645 --> 00:21:53,108
The Lord has really
blessed you with great talent. [laughing]

381
00:21:54,109 --> 00:21:56,862
-Speaking of which...
-I'm not going.

Here they go again.

[Myeongsuk] Goodness.

384
00:22:00,991 --> 00:22:03,535
Are you playing hard to get with the Lord?

385
00:22:03,618 --> 00:22:05,412
No, she's playing it with me.

386
00:22:07,205 --> 00:22:08,248
Are you nuts?

387
00:22:08,331 --> 00:22:11,501
When we first met in court

388
00:22:12,168 --> 00:22:14,629
for the abuse of authority trial,

389
00:22:14,713 --> 00:22:18,258
I almost fell for you then.

390
00:22:19,092 --> 00:22:20,427
Because you were so cool.

-[chuckles nervously]
-[Daon] And last time...

393
00:22:27,392 --> 00:22:29,519
You're very drunk right now.

394
00:22:31,229 --> 00:22:33,648
What are you doing? You think you're cool?

-[gasps]
-[all chuckling]

396
00:22:39,196 --> 00:22:42,282
I think you've had enough to drink.

397
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:45,118
No, I'm not drunk at all.

398
00:22:45,202 --> 00:22:46,912
I know myself. I can go on my own.

399
00:22:46,995 --> 00:22:48,747
-He says he's not drunk.
-[Mando] I'll take you home.

Honey!

00:22:54,961 --> 00:22:56,880
-He's a goner.
-[Mando] Detective.

403
00:22:56,963 --> 00:22:59,508
Detective. Gosh, he's heavy.

I don't know.

I'll give you a hint. Take a guess.

That's correct.

You got it right. [chuckles]

413
00:23:31,122 --> 00:23:33,208

[Daon] Hey, Kang Bitna.

415
00:23:50,433 --> 00:23:52,352
Can't you just be nice?

416
00:23:54,688 --> 00:23:55,814
No, I can't.

417
00:23:55,897 --> 00:23:58,900
Why not? Because you're a demon?

418
00:24:00,819 --> 00:24:03,405
Then keep being bad like a demon.

419
00:24:04,823 --> 00:24:08,535
Don't be nice sometimes
and get me confused.

420
00:24:09,035 --> 00:24:11,705
Don't be confused. I'm bad.

421
00:24:13,164 --> 00:24:15,917
No, you're good.

422
00:24:17,294 --> 00:24:19,254
You consoled me

423
00:24:19,963 --> 00:24:21,339
and saved our Dahui.

424
00:24:22,507 --> 00:24:23,550
You're good.

425
00:24:27,012 --> 00:24:29,014
Then why are you so suspicious of me?

426
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:31,141
That's because

427
00:24:31,850 --> 00:24:33,560
you did it.

428
00:24:33,977 --> 00:24:36,229

429
00:24:37,105 --> 00:24:40,734
But I hope you really didn't do it.

Just recycle this. You're going to

I will get rid of the bloodstains.

Just for today, I'd like to believe you.

440

-Yes.
-Where did you throw it?

What on earth is that?

If a demon did something wrong,
he must pay the price.

465
00:27:34,658 --> 00:27:37,077
I really recycled it.

466
00:27:37,661 --> 00:27:39,079
With which hand?

467
00:27:39,162 --> 00:27:40,997
What... I really...

468
00:27:41,081 --> 00:27:43,083
As always, it's my fault.

469
00:27:43,667 --> 00:27:46,419

Stop. And you, get up.

The can you threw away by Haeseo River,

Really?

476
00:28:06,439 --> 00:28:08,817
But it can't prove

477
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:11,278
that you killed Bae Jayeong.

478
00:28:11,361 --> 00:28:13,947
That's why he moved in next door.
To secure evidence.

479
00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:15,782
Then what do we do now?

480
00:28:15,866 --> 00:28:19,536
I have to kill sinners
as soon as possible and return to Hell.

481
00:28:21,037 --> 00:28:22,706
You find the witness to the serial murder?

482
00:28:22,789 --> 00:28:25,500
He was sent to an orphanage
right after the incident.

483
00:28:25,584 --> 00:28:28,920
I've been visiting orphanages
in the area and checking records.

484
00:28:29,004 --> 00:28:31,089
I'll secure their information soon.

485
00:28:31,173 --> 00:28:32,424
That's such a relief.

486
00:28:37,846 --> 00:28:40,640
So Han Daon did have evidence.

487
00:28:40,724 --> 00:28:42,893
Should I teach him a lesson?
I won't kill him.

488
00:28:43,476 --> 00:28:45,896
-I'll just maim him.
-Leave Han Daon alone.

489
00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:50,108
That might complicate things,
so just leave him.

490
00:28:50,192 --> 00:28:52,611
Right. Okay.

491
00:28:55,864 --> 00:28:56,907

-You don't get a second chance.
-Understood.

-Hey.
-[Mando] Yes?

494
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,425
Isn't she kind of strange today?

495
00:29:15,509 --> 00:29:17,469
She's always strange, so I don't know.

496
00:29:17,552 --> 00:29:20,055
That's not what I mean. Damn it!

Normally, she'd be hopping mad
because of Han Daon.

00:29:26,228 --> 00:29:29,064
But she protected him
and told us to leave him alone.

00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,033
Watch her closely.

504
00:29:40,867 --> 00:29:43,203
If she sheds even a single tear,
report to me.

505
00:29:43,286 --> 00:29:44,287
Why?

506
00:29:44,371 --> 00:29:46,623
Demons who fall in love with humans

507
00:29:46,706 --> 00:29:47,874
are useless.

508
00:29:48,458 --> 00:29:49,501
But I...

00:29:50,293 --> 00:29:52,712

You've received an award and saved a dog.

I'll take care of it.

552
00:32:24,155 --> 00:32:26,366
It's because you're too nice

I've given you money, so you can stop.

We're not on strike because of money.

I will return this money to you.

to see him before he was taken.

712
00:44:24,334 --> 00:44:25,752
What's the missing man's name?

713
00:44:27,045 --> 00:44:29,673
It's Mr. Won Changseon.

714
00:44:43,186 --> 00:44:46,106
WON CHANGSEON

715
00:44:56,199 --> 00:44:57,826
He's dead. Satisfied?

716
00:44:58,368 --> 00:45:00,412
I'll help check you out for the donuts.

717
00:45:01,288 --> 00:45:02,998
No need.

718
00:45:08,712 --> 00:45:09,713
How much is it?

719
00:45:20,599 --> 00:45:21,600
[screaming]

720
00:45:23,935 --> 00:45:26,479
Hello? Is this emergency services?

721
00:45:26,563 --> 00:45:28,148
There's someone...

722
00:45:28,231 --> 00:45:30,317
Someone's dead here.

723
00:45:33,028 --> 00:45:34,029
[reporters clamoring]

724
00:45:38,783 --> 00:45:39,868
[sighs]

725
00:45:39,951 --> 00:45:41,953
[reporters clamoring]

726
00:45:44,789 --> 00:45:47,417
[reporter 1] Look over here!
Give us a smile!

727
00:45:48,168 --> 00:45:49,252
[guard] Please make way.

728
00:45:49,336 --> 00:45:51,630
[reporter 2] They say you were the last
to see the deceased.

729
00:45:51,713 --> 00:45:53,006
What did you talk about?

730
00:45:53,089 --> 00:45:54,758
[reporter 3] Any words for the family?

731
00:45:56,426 --> 00:45:57,511
[reporter 4] Mr. Choi!

732
00:45:59,596 --> 00:46:02,224
Is it true you tried to end the strike
by bribing him?

733
00:46:02,307 --> 00:46:03,934
Were you involved in the death?

734
00:46:04,601 --> 00:46:06,853
I will cooperate fully
with the investigation.

735
00:46:06,937 --> 00:46:08,897
My deepest condolences to his family.

736
00:46:09,689 --> 00:46:12,859
[reporter 5] Please say a word for
the union and the bereaved.

737
00:46:17,489 --> 00:46:20,700
[Soyeong] Why did you send
300 million won to the victim's account?

738
00:46:20,784 --> 00:46:23,370
The deceased threatened Mr. Choi.

739
00:46:23,453 --> 00:46:25,455
It just doesn't make sense

740
00:46:25,539 --> 00:46:29,960
that the chairman of the labor union
would threaten the CEO.

741
00:46:30,043 --> 00:46:34,130
Mr. Choi is very generous
to the less fortunate.

742
00:46:34,214 --> 00:46:37,467
Then why did he hire thugs
to kidnap and assault the victim?

743
00:46:37,551 --> 00:46:39,219
-He never...
-Can you answer yourself?

744
00:46:39,302 --> 00:46:41,888
Detective, you can't do that.

745
00:46:42,848 --> 00:46:44,015
It's all right.

746
00:46:45,767 --> 00:46:47,185
I really know nothing about it.

747
00:46:48,895 --> 00:46:51,731
A tape recorder that the deceased had
has been found.

748
00:46:52,649 --> 00:46:55,235
Near the golf practice range owned by you.

749
00:46:56,778 --> 00:46:58,321
[Wonjoong] <i>I said go.</i>

750
00:46:58,780 --> 00:46:59,781
[Changseon groaning]

751
00:46:59,865 --> 00:47:03,410
[Wonjoong] <i>God, you keep getting
in my way. I'm so upset.</i>

752
00:47:03,493 --> 00:47:05,120
[Changseon] <i>Please, stop.</i>

753
00:47:05,203 --> 00:47:06,663
[Wonjoong] <i>That's what I want to say.</i>

754
00:47:09,124 --> 00:47:10,458
Do you still not know?

755
00:47:12,836 --> 00:47:14,004
Oh, right.

756
00:47:14,671 --> 00:47:16,006
Oh, that day.

757
00:47:17,674 --> 00:47:20,302
I had dinner with Mr. Won.

758
00:47:20,927 --> 00:47:22,262
And we played golf after.

759
00:47:22,762 --> 00:47:23,763
So...

760
00:47:25,390 --> 00:47:27,851
are you admitting that
you assaulted the deceased?

761
00:47:27,934 --> 00:47:29,269
Detective.

762
00:47:29,352 --> 00:47:31,855
The chairman
of my company's union is dead.

763
00:47:31,938 --> 00:47:33,356
No one is sadder than me.

764
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:36,359
Are you still going to deny it
despite this evidence?

765
00:47:38,028 --> 00:47:39,279
What evidence?

766
00:47:40,113 --> 00:47:41,323
Right.

767
00:47:42,032 --> 00:47:45,619
The evidence showing
that I accidentally hit him with the ball?

768
00:47:46,786 --> 00:47:47,871
But...

769
00:47:48,663 --> 00:47:52,125
that's not enough
to prove I killed him. Right?

770
00:47:52,209 --> 00:47:53,335
Am I right?

771
00:47:53,418 --> 00:47:54,628
Do you know...

772
00:47:56,338 --> 00:47:57,714
what's most difficult in business?

773
00:47:58,465 --> 00:48:01,635
Competition with other companies?
Securing customers?

774
00:48:03,929 --> 00:48:06,640
It's dealing with the have-nots.

775
00:48:07,224 --> 00:48:09,893
Those who have nothing
and so with nothing to lose.

776
00:48:09,976 --> 00:48:13,063
Those who just want
a piece of their masters

777
00:48:13,939 --> 00:48:15,899
to feed themselves.

778
00:48:20,278 --> 00:48:21,488
The lowlifes.

779
00:48:36,878 --> 00:48:37,879
[phone buzzing]

780
00:48:40,382 --> 00:48:41,758
This is Kim Soyeong.

781
00:48:43,844 --> 00:48:44,845
The chief?

782
00:48:45,929 --> 00:48:47,472
[chief] I'll keep it short.

783
00:48:47,556 --> 00:48:49,391
Cover up Choi Wonjoong's case.

784
00:48:50,350 --> 00:48:51,560
We can't do that.

785
00:48:52,435 --> 00:48:54,521
You bastard. Are you the chief here?

786
00:48:54,604 --> 00:48:55,689
Do as you're told.

787
00:48:55,772 --> 00:48:58,066
Even if the chief of police orders it,

788
00:48:58,149 --> 00:49:00,235
I can't do that.

789
00:49:03,071 --> 00:49:05,907
Do you think I'm doing this
because I want to?

790
00:49:05,991 --> 00:49:07,909
The Choi Wonjoong case

791
00:49:07,993 --> 00:49:11,037
will be thoroughly investigated
and sent to the prosecution.

792
00:49:11,121 --> 00:49:12,581
Kim Soyeong!

793
00:49:12,664 --> 00:49:14,666
[â™ª intense music playing]

794
00:49:31,933 --> 00:49:33,018
[Daon clears throat]

795
00:49:37,397 --> 00:49:38,982
Ignore what the chief said.

796
00:49:39,065 --> 00:49:41,318
We're going ahead with the investigation.

797
00:49:42,068 --> 00:49:43,320
-Are you okay?
-[Soyeong scoffs]

798
00:49:43,403 --> 00:49:45,363
Why wouldn't I be?

799
00:49:46,573 --> 00:49:47,574
Are you okay?

800
00:49:47,657 --> 00:49:51,369
Mocking the less fortunate
and lying outright. It makes me mad.

801
00:49:53,663 --> 00:49:55,957
If only I could punish
Choi Wonjoong myself,

802
00:49:56,708 --> 00:49:58,001
I'd kill him.

803
00:49:58,084 --> 00:50:01,796
The duty of a police officer
is to reveal the crime, not punish.

804
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:04,382
We investigate according to procedure,

805
00:50:04,466 --> 00:50:06,426
and judges punish with verdicts.

806
00:50:06,510 --> 00:50:08,011
Legally and fairly.

807
00:50:09,262 --> 00:50:10,263
Promise me.

808
00:50:11,431 --> 00:50:13,308
Wherever you are and whatever you do,

809
00:50:13,391 --> 00:50:15,477
don't ever forget that you're a detective.

810
00:50:16,978 --> 00:50:19,397
I'm not a kid. I don't do pinky promises.

811
00:50:19,981 --> 00:50:21,358
You're a kid to me.

812
00:50:23,527 --> 00:50:24,861
[Daon] Happy?

813
00:50:24,945 --> 00:50:26,655
That's enough, it's gross.

814
00:50:31,576 --> 00:50:35,705
[Chairman Choi] The matter has gotten
out of hand.

815
00:50:35,789 --> 00:50:37,582
Please help us, Assemblyman.

816
00:50:42,337 --> 00:50:43,463
Please help us.

817
00:50:44,714 --> 00:50:48,343
[Seonho] What dirty scheme
are you plotting here?

818
00:50:50,011 --> 00:50:51,137
Don't tell me you...

819
00:50:51,721 --> 00:50:53,431
No, I didn't do drugs.

820
00:50:54,015 --> 00:50:58,019
Just tell him to get up.
The old man will ruin his knees.

821
00:50:59,104 --> 00:51:02,774
[sighs] Mr. Choi, get up.

822
00:51:02,858 --> 00:51:04,526
I said get up.

823
00:51:09,614 --> 00:51:12,659
I know how much you care for your son.

824
00:51:13,285 --> 00:51:15,120
But the judicial system

825
00:51:15,203 --> 00:51:18,707
is as solid as an iron fortress.

826
00:51:18,790 --> 00:51:20,917
I can't bend it to my will.

827
00:51:22,627 --> 00:51:27,424
Our group has some land.

828
00:51:28,049 --> 00:51:29,217
[laughs]

829
00:51:30,802 --> 00:51:33,555
It may be a firm fortress,

830
00:51:34,848 --> 00:51:37,309
but there may be a crack or two somewhere.

831
00:51:37,851 --> 00:51:38,977
So you're saying

832
00:51:39,728 --> 00:51:42,355
I'm the crack
in the country's judicial system?

833
00:51:42,939 --> 00:51:45,442
Don't twist my words that way.

834
00:51:46,067 --> 00:51:48,987
Why are you so twisted, Judge Kang?

835
00:51:49,070 --> 00:51:50,822
You're the one who started it.

836
00:51:50,906 --> 00:51:52,157
Anyway,

837
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:55,869
you take care of it
according to precedents.

838
00:51:55,952 --> 00:51:58,455
Is this a favor or external pressure?

839
00:51:59,331 --> 00:52:01,541
You offer me nothing,
so it can't be a favor.

840
00:52:01,625 --> 00:52:04,461
And it's too non-threatening
to be external pressure.

841
00:52:04,544 --> 00:52:06,296
It's neither.

842
00:52:06,379 --> 00:52:09,716
Were you promised a nice position
somewhere after your retirement?

843
00:52:11,593 --> 00:52:13,220
What do you take me for?

844
00:52:14,012 --> 00:52:16,640
The person who always
assigns me annoying trials...

845
00:52:16,723 --> 00:52:18,266
His underling.

846
00:52:22,854 --> 00:52:23,855
Underling.

847
00:52:23,939 --> 00:52:26,024
Under...

848
00:52:26,858 --> 00:52:28,151
CHIEF JUDGE NA YEONGJIN

849
00:52:28,235 --> 00:52:32,280
Thanks to the recorder the victim took
when he went to see the defendant,

850
00:52:32,364 --> 00:52:35,283
the defendant's assault
was caught red-handed.

851
00:52:36,409 --> 00:52:39,913
You work for one of the top law firms
that only hires elites.

852
00:52:39,996 --> 00:52:42,999
Aren't you embarrassed
to be representing someone like him?

853
00:52:43,667 --> 00:52:46,169
Don't like it that a judge
is talking to you like this?

854
00:52:46,878 --> 00:52:48,088
[chuckles]

855
00:52:49,130 --> 00:52:50,715
No, Your Honor.

856
00:52:52,217 --> 00:52:54,427
Prosecutor, you may question
the defendant.

857
00:52:56,388 --> 00:52:57,556
No questions, Your Honor.

858
00:52:58,723 --> 00:53:01,434
PROSECUTION

859
00:53:03,603 --> 00:53:04,813
[scoffs]

860
00:53:07,357 --> 00:53:10,735
Defendant, why did you hit
the victim with a golf ball?

861
00:53:11,319 --> 00:53:13,905
Where did you hide the thugs
who kidnapped the victim?

862
00:53:13,989 --> 00:53:16,199
Your Honor, the defendant is...

863
00:53:16,283 --> 00:53:18,994
I just asked the defendant.

864
00:53:21,371 --> 00:53:22,664
DEFENSE

865
00:53:25,166 --> 00:53:28,253
I didn't intend to hit him.
It was an accident.

866
00:53:28,336 --> 00:53:31,631
And they weren't thugs.
They were employees of a security company.

867
00:53:32,757 --> 00:53:34,426
I merely asked them

868
00:53:34,509 --> 00:53:37,721
to safely escort Mr. Won
to the golf course.

869
00:53:37,804 --> 00:53:40,390
Everything from when the victim
visited your home

870
00:53:40,473 --> 00:53:43,977
to when he was brought to
the golf course was recorded.

871
00:53:44,060 --> 00:53:46,021
Do you still intend to deny it?

872
00:53:46,104 --> 00:53:49,858
I feel regretful that the security staff
were rough with Mr. Won.

873
00:53:49,941 --> 00:53:52,027
But I don't know anything about it.

874
00:53:52,110 --> 00:53:55,989
And you know nothing
about the victim's suicide?

875
00:53:57,240 --> 00:53:58,283
No.

876
00:53:58,366 --> 00:53:59,367
[scoffs]

877
00:54:00,869 --> 00:54:03,079
[sighs] This is no fun.

878
00:54:03,163 --> 00:54:04,998
That'll be all for today.

879
00:54:17,928 --> 00:54:19,679
She's a complete nutjob.

880
00:54:23,892 --> 00:54:25,101
How was the trial?

881
00:54:25,810 --> 00:54:28,855
It's a so-so trial.
How well could it have gone?

882
00:54:28,939 --> 00:54:31,775
Oh, right. Detective Han Daon called.

883
00:54:31,858 --> 00:54:33,443
He wants to meet at the cafe.

884
00:54:34,903 --> 00:54:36,196
Now?

885
00:54:46,957 --> 00:54:48,124
Just get to the point.

886
00:54:48,708 --> 00:54:51,002
You haven't taken my calls since that day.

887
00:54:51,086 --> 00:54:52,462
I was wasted, wasn't I?

888
00:54:53,797 --> 00:54:56,299
-I'm sorry. It won't happen...
-[Judge Kang] To the point.

889
00:54:58,635 --> 00:54:59,636
Right.

890
00:55:02,055 --> 00:55:03,390
The victim's family

891
00:55:03,473 --> 00:55:06,476

would've never taken his own life.

892
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:09,896
Could you meet with the family
and listen to what they have to say?

893
00:55:09,980 --> 00:55:11,147
I don't have time.

894
00:55:13,066 --> 00:55:14,651
There was external pressure.

895
00:55:16,236 --> 00:55:19,739
What are they hiding that they're
pressuring mere detectives?

896
00:55:19,823 --> 00:55:21,408
How would I know that?

897
00:55:21,491 --> 00:55:25,370
Besides, what am I supposed to do
when even the police can't figure it out?

898
00:55:29,332 --> 00:55:31,960
You're a demon. And so I thought

899
00:55:32,043 --> 00:55:35,380
maybe you could find proof
Choi Wonjoong caused his death.

900
00:55:37,382 --> 00:55:40,427

to trust me when you need me.

902

I know it's weird I'm asking.
So I hesitated,

903
00:55:49,978 --> 00:55:52,480

906
00:56:06,328 --> 00:56:08,747
This won't be easy on you.

907
00:56:08,830 --> 00:56:10,999

909
00:56:26,973 --> 00:56:29,559

I wouldn't have had the chance to use it.

Because they cremate the body
a few days after the autopsy.
