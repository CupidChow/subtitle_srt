1
00:00:26,484 --> 00:00:30,947
THE JUDGE FROM HELL

2
00:00:31,072 --> 00:00:34,367
CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS.

3
00:00:34,451 --> 00:00:35,952
CHILD ACTORS AND ANIMALS
FILMED IN SAFE SITUATIONS.

4
00:00:38,955 --> 00:00:40,081
I am a demon.

5
00:00:41,916 --> 00:00:43,168
I came from Hell.

6
00:00:44,169 --> 00:00:48,506
As you can see, I've currently possessed
the body of a human named Kang Bitna.

7
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:54,220
I didn't choose this body. But I'm
satisfied when I look in the mirror.

8
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:56,347
Especially the face.

9
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:59,976
Does that mean Kang Bitna died?

10
00:01:03,146 --> 00:01:04,147
A while back.

11
00:02:57,093 --> 00:03:02,182
ALL WHO ENTER HERE, ABANDON ALL HOPE

12
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:13,943
<i>Gehenna.</i>

13
00:03:17,488 --> 00:03:19,991
<i>Unfortunately,
Kang Bitna is dead.</i>

14
00:03:20,074 --> 00:03:22,243
<i>She was supposed to go to Fake Hell</i>

15
00:03:23,077 --> 00:03:26,289
<i>sent to a Murder Hell
due to a sinner classification system.</i>

16
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:33,504
Who's that?

17
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:36,382
VALAK
JUDGE'S ASSISTANT, MURDERERS' HELL

18
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,426
Wasn't he the last one?

19
00:03:38,509 --> 00:03:39,510
JUSTITIA
JUDGE

20
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:42,222
Well... That's strange.

21
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:45,266
This human is the last one.

22
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:47,560
Just brand him and send him to Gehenna.

23
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:49,062
What have I done?

24
00:03:49,187 --> 00:03:52,815
<i>Unrepentant, unforgiven
humans who have committed a sin.</i>

25
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:56,277
<i>Murderers are branded on the forehead
and receive severe punishment.</i>

26
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:06,579
<i>Though the dead Kang Bitna
probably didn't think so.</i>

27
00:04:08,456 --> 00:04:10,959
Are you
putting me on trial?

28
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:12,752
I'm a judge, too.

29
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:14,379
A judge?

30
00:04:15,004 --> 00:04:16,756
How did a judge end up here?

31
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:20,635
Well...

32
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:25,723
I don't know.
Someone with a knife in the park--

33
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:27,684
I exclusively deal with murderers.

34
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:30,019
Only murderers are allowed in this court.

35
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:31,562
I never killed anyone.

36
00:04:32,563 --> 00:04:35,525
Justitia, maybe
we should make sure.

37
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:37,777
She's not on today's list.

38
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,779
She ended up here, so I get to decide.

39
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:41,406
Bring her.

40
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:43,783
She always gets her way.

41
00:04:48,162 --> 00:04:50,164
Let's say
you killed one person.

42
00:04:50,748 --> 00:04:53,543
With one murder,
you get 20,000 years in Gehenna.

43
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:57,297
But since you were rude to me,
you get an extra 50,000 years.

44
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:01,175
I never killed anyone.
I didn't do it!

45
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:03,219
Valak, what are you doing? Brand her.

46
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:05,430
I can't.
She's not even on the list.

47
00:05:05,513 --> 00:05:08,766
If I brand her, it can't be undone.

48
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:11,352
What if Bael gets angry?

49
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:12,895
Give it! I'll do it.

50
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:18,401
I'm not a murderer. I'm not.

51
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:22,905
A judge should listen
to the falsely accused, too.

52
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:24,991
Why won't you listen to me?

53
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:26,075
Okay, fine.

54
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:27,368
All right.

55
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:33,958
Court is adjourned.

56
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:16,250
A sinner to be punished in Fake Hell

57
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:20,838
was almost branded as a murderer
and sent to Gehenna.

58
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:22,965
Do you admit to your mistake, Justitia?

59
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:24,050
Not at all.

60
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:25,259
It's not my fault.

61
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:28,012
It's the fault of the idiots
who missed her.

62
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:29,097
BAEL
DIRECTOR OF HELL

63
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,848
Had you listened to her,

64
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:33,351
it could have been set right.

65
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:34,936
Bael,

66
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:37,522
a judge delivers a verdict.

67
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:40,024
I'm not obliged
to listen to their nonsense,

68
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:42,151
their pleading innocence.

69
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:45,238
Justitia, go to the human world,

70
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:49,867
punish ten murderers who are unrepentant

71
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:51,953
and unforgiven,

72
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:56,958
take their lives, and send them to Hell.

73
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:58,167
You have one year.

74
00:06:58,251 --> 00:06:59,669
Ten murderers?

75
00:07:01,712 --> 00:07:02,880
- Valak.
- Yes?

76
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:05,800
You will go, too.

77
00:07:05,883 --> 00:07:08,719
Pardon? Me? Why?

78
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:10,179
All your duties

79
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:13,182
must be carried out
in the body of the human

80
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:15,810
who almost faced great harm
as a result of your error.

81
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:19,772
You must live her life
as you fulfill your mission.

82
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:21,482
If you don't complete it,

83
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:23,109
you will die.

84
00:07:23,192 --> 00:07:24,485
You will die.

85
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:25,570
No.

86
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:27,864
No. I don't want to!

87
00:07:42,211 --> 00:07:45,256
PAIMON
JUDGE OF DISTRICT 7, BETRAYERS' HELL

88
00:07:45,339 --> 00:07:48,759
If you want to die, then fine.

89
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,600
I will go, Bael.

90
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:31,844
Please, don't kill me.

91
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:40,978
KANG BITNA

92
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:42,480
<i>I, a demon, am here</i>

93
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:45,149
<i>due to an unfair demotion.</i>

94
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:01,707
Lastly, I'd like to ask you a question.

95
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:06,045
Is what I've said so far true?

96
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:10,216
Or did I just make it up to fool you?

97
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:16,973
THE JUDGE FROM HELL

98
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:18,975
EPISODE 1

99
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:21,602
{\an8}When I was admitted after the stabbing,

100
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:24,313
{\an8}the colas you snuck in for me
were so good.

101
00:09:24,772 --> 00:09:26,607
{\an8}I agreed to the residency training

102
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:27,775
{\an8}because of that.

103
00:09:27,858 --> 00:09:30,778
{\an8}I know. Thanks so much.

104
00:09:30,861 --> 00:09:34,490
{\an8}-So continue with your treatment.
-Okay.

105
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:36,367
{\an8}I'm not a demon. Happy now?

106
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:38,369
{\an8}It doesn't have to be this hospital.

107
00:09:38,452 --> 00:09:40,663
{\an8}Continue your treatment anywhere.

108
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:43,416
{\an8}PSYCH EVALUATION
PTSD, DELUSIONAL DISORDER

109
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:46,168
{\an8}Thank you for everything.

110
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:48,087
{\an8}And be good.

111
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:49,880
{\an8}Or you'll go to Hell.

112
00:10:10,234 --> 00:10:11,777
COURT

113
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:35,551
All rise.

114
00:10:42,516 --> 00:10:44,602
Please be seated.

115
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:49,315
I'm busy, so let's make it quick.

116
00:10:49,398 --> 00:10:51,984
Defendant, state your name
and affiliation.

117
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:53,569
Violent Crime Investigation Team 2...

118
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:56,739
...Lieutenant Han Daon.

119
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:59,533
You were tried
for direct assault last time, correct?

120
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:01,243
Yes, that's right.

121
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:06,332
No attorney again this time?

122
00:11:06,415 --> 00:11:07,625
Why's that?

123
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:11,045
I believe I'm not at fault.

124
00:11:11,128 --> 00:11:14,090
So I didn't think I'd need legal advice.

125
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:18,302
People don't necessarily appoint a lawyer
because they did something wrong.

126
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:20,763
Are you confident
you will win today's trial?

127
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:23,599
No, but...

128
00:11:24,892 --> 00:11:28,646
I believe that if there is justice,
the law will protect me.

129
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:31,899
Will it really?

130
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:36,237
Can you describe
the circumstances of the arrest?

131
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,321
At the time,

132
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:40,408
I was chasing a suspect
who assaulted a citizen and fled.

133
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:42,952
Stop right there!

134
00:11:43,327 --> 00:11:45,121
Hey! I said stop!

135
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:53,504
There's nowhere to go now, punk.

136
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,800
Drop it, okay?

137
00:11:57,883 --> 00:11:59,760
Beat it while you still can.

138
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:02,054
Do you know who my mother is?

139
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:05,433
No, I don't.
But I'm jealous she's still alive.

140
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,608
No more playing nice.

141
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:18,487
My shoulder! You're going to break it!

142
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:20,740
You have the right to remain silent...

143
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:22,992
...and the right to an attorney.

144
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:24,785
So call your mom.

145
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:26,871
Ah.

146
00:12:27,204 --> 00:12:28,622
So what happened to him?

147
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:32,376
We went to court,
but he got off with a small fine.

148
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:36,130
Hmm. And he sued you after the trial?

149
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:38,632
Yes. He's arguing that
when I kicked the knife,

150
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:41,719
I hit his hand and hurt it.

151
00:12:41,802 --> 00:12:43,345
It's the truth,
not an argument.

152
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:45,931
Please refer to the diagnosis submitted.

153
00:12:46,056 --> 00:12:50,561
Ah. You mean a two-week recovery prognosis
they hand out like candy?

154
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:03,240
Why aren't the results
of a full medical exam included?

155
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:05,075
I'd like to see how badly he's hurt.

156
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:08,621
The victim is currently unable to
eat properly because of his injury.

157
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:12,917
He should have just starved to death.
Why sue?

158
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:18,005
Your Honor,
you've gone too far.

159
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:20,716
You're the one who's gone too far.

160
00:13:21,842 --> 00:13:23,594
The police can't just stand there.

161
00:13:23,677 --> 00:13:26,472
He came at him with a knife.
What was he supposed to do?

162
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:29,183
Say, "Please, sir, give me the knife"?

163
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:32,686
Or should he have gotten stabbed
and buried with honors?

164
00:13:34,396 --> 00:13:38,025
An arrest could've been made
easily without excessive use of force.

165
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:42,363
If that's excessive use of force,
this is excessive indictment.

166
00:13:42,446 --> 00:13:44,740
Why bring such a small matter to court

167
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:46,992
and make me busier? This is so annoying.

168
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:50,579
Your Honor, we are in court.
Let's show some respect.

169
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:53,415
Is this church
or something? Respect?

170
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:57,211
His mother is the president of PTL Group.

171
00:13:57,837 --> 00:14:00,840
And the prosecutor's father-in-law
went to school with her.

172
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:03,592
PROSECUTION

173
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:07,346
Now, am I the one
disrespecting the law in court?

174
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:09,265
Or is it you, Prosecutor?

175
00:14:14,603 --> 00:14:15,938
I'll be late.

176
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:18,274
Defendant. Your final statement. Hurry.

177
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:26,866
Every night, before I go to bed,
I regret that day.

178
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:30,703
If I'd known I would be tried,
I'd have done it differently.

179
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:34,748
I would've kicked his hand
pretending to aim for the knife.

180
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,209
And when I cuffed him,

181
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:40,421
I should have twisted his arm harder.
That's what I regret.

182
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:44,592
You're not remorseful?

183
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:48,721
There's no need to be.
I didn't do anything wrong.

184
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:58,564
I have made my decision.

185
00:14:58,647 --> 00:15:01,317
Everyone,
this is the Goddess of Justice.

186
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:05,487
But why are her eyes covered?

187
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:08,240
Her eyes are covered because...

188
00:15:09,783 --> 00:15:10,993
Should we ask the judge?

189
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:12,620
Yes!

190
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:15,915
Excuse me, Judge?
May we have a moment of your time?

191
00:15:16,832 --> 00:15:18,250
- I'm not a judge.
- Liar!

192
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:20,002
You're wearing a judge's robe!

193
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:24,423
Liar! A judge is lying!

194
00:15:24,506 --> 00:15:26,508
It's true. I'm not a judge.

195
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:28,260
Then what are you?

196
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:30,512
Detective Kim. I was acquitted.

197
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:33,015
- Not guilty.
- Don't get scared and cry.

198
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:34,308
I'm actually...

199
00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:36,393
a demon.
A terrifying demon!

200
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:44,109
- I'll explain more when I get back.
- I really am a demon.

201
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:47,321
Stop lying.
No demon's that pretty.

202
00:15:47,404 --> 00:15:48,697
- What?
- Yeah!

203
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:50,908
Demons have horns.

204
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:54,036
And they look scary, but you're pretty.

205
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:56,330
Seriously.

206
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:58,624
Am I that pretty?

207
00:15:58,707 --> 00:16:01,752
Yes! You're very pretty!

208
00:16:01,835 --> 00:16:05,255
Gosh! Children can't be fooled.

209
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:07,591
What's the question?

210
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:11,428
Why are her eyes covered?

211
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:13,430
What a great question.

212
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:16,225
She's playing hide-and-seek
with a bad guy.

213
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:19,895
Why does she need a knife
to play hide-and-seek?

214
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:21,730
So she can cut them up...

215
00:16:26,276 --> 00:16:27,569
To teach them a lesson.

216
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:30,280
- To teach them a lesson.
- To teach them a lesson.

217
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:33,826
But that's too long.
Smaller, mobile ones are used these days.

218
00:16:33,909 --> 00:16:35,536
Ma'am, your hand...

219
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:40,374
Then what's that? Why's she holding that?

220
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:42,167
That's a scale.

221
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:45,212
It's used to measure
how bad the sinner's deeds were.

222
00:16:45,295 --> 00:16:48,257
Ma'am! What's her name?

223
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:54,596
Justitia. Known as the Goddess of Justice.

224
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:56,557
Though she's not really.

225
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:59,059
But what's justice?

226
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:00,853
It's simple.

227
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:04,398
Good people live happy lives
and bad people are punished.

228
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:05,899
That's justice.

229
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:08,485
Then why do bad people live better?

230
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:10,904
Because there's no justice in this world.

231
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:15,451
Do you want to repeat after me?

232
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:17,453
Yes!

233
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:19,997
- Justice...
- Justice...

234
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:22,708
- ...is dead!
- ...is dead!

235
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:24,710
- Justice...
- Justice...

236
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:27,337
- Who needs it?
- Who needs it?

237
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:29,423
One more time. Justice...

238
00:17:29,506 --> 00:17:30,507
Justice...

239
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:32,593
- ...is dead!
- ...is dead!

240
00:17:32,676 --> 00:17:34,595
- Justice...
- Justice...

241
00:17:34,678 --> 00:17:37,139
- Who needs it?
- Who needs it?

242
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:38,807
Good job!

243
00:17:40,517 --> 00:17:41,769
Oh, no. I'm late.

244
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:42,853
Bye!

245
00:17:42,936 --> 00:17:44,354
Wait! Judge Kang!

246
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:49,068
I'm glad I ran into you. Your name is...

247
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:51,528
What was it? It reminded me of softener.

248
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:54,073
Han Daon. I have something to ask you.

249
00:17:55,949 --> 00:17:57,534
Fifth floor, 18th Criminal Division.

250
00:17:57,618 --> 00:17:59,870
You can get a temporary pass and go up.

251
00:17:59,953 --> 00:18:01,288
What? Why are you--

252
00:18:01,371 --> 00:18:03,791
When you get there,
you'll see a chubby man.

253
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,794
-Give it to him.
-What...

254
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:10,172
Wait. Judge Kang.

255
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:12,508
What? You don't think you can find it?

256
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:15,219
No, I'm curious why you acquitted me.

257
00:18:15,969 --> 00:18:18,722
Not happy with it?
Shall I hand you a death sentence?

258
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:22,851
I was moved because you
sympathized with my frustration.

259
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:25,229
You got me totally wrong.

260
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,481
Pardon?

261
00:18:27,564 --> 00:18:31,110
I'm not interested in the stories
of the wronged. Nor do I sympathize.

262
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:36,115
Do you know
why I like being a criminal court judge?

263
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:38,659
Because I can meet a lot of bad guys.

264
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:42,079
Those who deserve to go to Hell.

265
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:45,124
So no need to thank me.

266
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:47,543
I'm just disgusted by brazen criminals

267
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:50,295
who don't repent for their crimes.

268
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:51,964
Either way,

269
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:54,550
you did come to a ruling based on the law.

270
00:18:55,592 --> 00:18:57,803
If you ever need help, call me.

271
00:18:57,886 --> 00:19:00,347
I make sure to give back
what I've been given.

272
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:03,559
I'm just too perfect
to need anyone's help.

273
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:05,811
Still, you never know.

274
00:19:05,894 --> 00:19:09,314
"Nobong Police Station, Violent Crime
Investigation Team 2, Han Daon."

275
00:19:10,023 --> 00:19:11,150
I'll remember it.

276
00:19:25,914 --> 00:19:27,416
CLERK KOO MANDO

277
00:19:29,751 --> 00:19:32,921
Is killing one criminal this hard?

278
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:34,756
Killing is hard?

279
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:36,133
Killing what?

280
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:39,595
Nothing. It's nothing.

281
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:42,598
-I'm just tired--
-Yes, this is the 18th Criminal Division.

282
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:44,516
Has our judge's trial ended?

283
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,518
Why ask
if you're not going to listen?

284
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:49,021
Really? Then where is she?

285
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:52,524
Yes?

286
00:19:54,401 --> 00:19:55,402
Hello.

287
00:19:55,485 --> 00:19:56,570
Can I help you?

288
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:00,908
The chubby guy.

289
00:20:02,784 --> 00:20:03,785
Right.

290
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:05,746
The judge asked me to deliver this.

291
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:08,790
Why did she give these important things
to a stranger?

292
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:12,294
-Either way, thank you.
-Where is Judge Kang?

293
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:16,298
I don't know. She left in a hurry.

294
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:19,134
Gosh. When will she grow up?

295
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:22,262
Goodness.

296
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:34,691
Ah!

297
00:20:36,276 --> 00:20:37,653
My eyes.

298
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:58,840
God is so cruel.

299
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:04,346
Did you know?

300
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:06,974
God listens to all your prayers

301
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:08,809
but doesn't grant them all.

302
00:21:10,018 --> 00:21:11,061
Who are you?

303
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:16,483
Nice to meet you. I'm judge Kang Bitna.
I'll be taking your case.

304
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:19,027
How did you know I was here?

305
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:22,239
Did you have someone watch me?

306
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:25,200
No. I'm just interested.

307
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:28,453
Interested in the truth
of the case as a judge.

308
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:36,169
I already told the police everything
and submitted a non-punishment letter.

309
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:39,840
I just find
the non-punishment letter strange.

310
00:21:39,923 --> 00:21:43,510
He hit you and threatened to kill you.

311
00:21:43,593 --> 00:21:45,053
How can you forgive him?

312
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:00,819
You're lying about

313
00:22:01,528 --> 00:22:02,863
forgiving him, aren't you?

314
00:22:04,531 --> 00:22:05,741
I'm not lying.

315
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:08,744
I want him to be released
from the lock-up soon.

316
00:22:16,209 --> 00:22:18,587
Don't be like that.
Be honest with me.

317
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:22,299
Only then can I make the right ruling.

318
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:31,933
I have nothing more to say.

319
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:34,311
No, wait!

320
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:38,315
Really?

321
00:22:39,816 --> 00:22:41,151
Ms. Cha Minjeong?

322
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:45,822
Ms. Cha!

323
00:22:46,448 --> 00:22:48,533
Ms. Cha, let's talk.

324
00:22:49,284 --> 00:22:51,536
Stop following me.

325
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:54,331
Tomorrow is the first trial.

326
00:22:54,998 --> 00:22:58,877
If you keep doing this, I have
to accept the non-punishment letter.

327
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,337
Then do it.

328
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:03,340
That's why I submitted it.
Why are you doing this?

329
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:05,801
I'm a judge.

330
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:09,763
A judge must consider
even the smallest truth to make a ruling.

331
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:16,686
Tell me. I'm all ears.

332
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:23,110
No. You may be a judge,
but you have no right to do this.

333
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:27,155
Are you all right?

334
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:28,240
Excuse me.

335
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:30,117
She keeps following me.

336
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,911
Ma'am, you can't do this here.

337
00:23:34,162 --> 00:23:35,747
There's been a misunderstanding.

338
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:37,707
I'm a judge.

339
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:41,795
Can you show us your government ID?

340
00:23:42,712 --> 00:23:43,755
Here...

341
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:49,052
Well, I don't have it now.

342
00:23:49,136 --> 00:23:51,012
Take my personal ID for now.

343
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:56,977
Ms. Cha...

344
00:23:57,477 --> 00:23:58,687
Ma'am?

345
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,231
Please come with us.

346
00:24:04,025 --> 00:24:05,902
PSYCH EVALUATION
PTSD, DELUSIONAL DISORDER

347
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:21,918
Congrats, Han Daon!

348
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:24,254
Stop! You're grossing me out!

349
00:24:25,213 --> 00:24:26,465
You punk.

350
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:29,050
My son made it back
from the gates of Hell.

351
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:31,678
Can't a mother hug her son?

352
00:24:31,761 --> 00:24:33,138
That really hurts.

353
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:35,599
I hit you so it hurts.

354
00:24:36,683 --> 00:24:38,226
Be more careful next time.

355
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:42,105
Do your best to catch criminals,
but don't give up your life for it.

356
00:24:44,232 --> 00:24:45,442
You, too.

357
00:24:45,525 --> 00:24:47,110
Don't worry about me, punk!

358
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:49,196
So,

359
00:24:50,363 --> 00:24:52,991
who's the savior who acquitted you?

360
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:56,578
- Well...
- Detective Kim!

361
00:24:58,205 --> 00:25:00,123
Cha Minjeong called the police.

362
00:25:00,207 --> 00:25:01,666
Someone kept following her.

363
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:04,503
Moon Jeongjun's in jail. So who is it?

364
00:25:04,586 --> 00:25:08,840
- They're headed here now.
- She seemed a bit not right in the head.

365
00:25:09,424 --> 00:25:11,718
I said I'm going. I'm going!

366
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:13,637
Judge Kang?

367
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:16,056
Hey.

368
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:20,143
Nobong Police Station, Violent Crime
Investigation Team 2, Han Daon?

369
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:26,650
Kang Bitna, age 35, judge, right?

370
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:29,402
I thought we were closer than this.

371
00:25:30,237 --> 00:25:31,821
Weren't we?

372
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:39,329
It's not what you're thinking.

373
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:43,959
Why did you follow Cha Minjeong?

374
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:45,502
I wanted to ask her something.

375
00:25:46,586 --> 00:25:48,713
What's that?

376
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:52,050
About the truth she's hiding.
And what she really feels.

377
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:57,639
Why do you care what Ms. Cha is hiding?

378
00:25:58,848 --> 00:26:01,643
I thought you were
the lead detective on her case.

379
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:05,105
I'm the judge in charge of her trial.

380
00:26:05,772 --> 00:26:08,817
So you're doubtful
of the non-punishment letter?

381
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:11,861
For a fair trial,
I need the truth, not lies.

382
00:26:11,945 --> 00:26:13,655
And uncovering the truth

383
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:16,116
and punishing the bad guys properly

384
00:26:16,783 --> 00:26:18,285
is the judge's job.

385
00:26:26,167 --> 00:26:29,379
I haven't shown this to anyone else.

386
00:26:31,131 --> 00:26:32,799
Don't look at me like that.

387
00:26:32,882 --> 00:26:34,801
I was misdiagnosed by a quack.

388
00:26:34,884 --> 00:26:38,013
I saw it was from
the most famous hospital in the country.

389
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:41,349
So, Defendant, I mean...

390
00:26:42,392 --> 00:26:43,893
Detective. What do you think?

391
00:26:43,977 --> 00:26:48,023
I saw you telling a group of kids
that you're a demon.

392
00:26:49,149 --> 00:26:52,068
You're saying I need treatment
for my diagnosis?

393
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:54,863
I don't know if demons exist.

394
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:56,948
But I'm certain there's no God.

395
00:26:57,532 --> 00:27:01,494
If there was,
the world wouldn't be in this state.

396
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:04,998
You've got it seriously wrong.

397
00:27:05,081 --> 00:27:08,001
It's not God or Satan
who's made such a mess here.

398
00:27:08,084 --> 00:27:09,586
It's humans.

399
00:27:09,669 --> 00:27:13,340
The very humans you arrest and I judge.

400
00:27:13,923 --> 00:27:15,216
I think you're right.

401
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,843
You haven't answered me yet.

402
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:21,473
Do you also think
I'm someone who needs treatment?

403
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:25,935
I don't care
whether you're a demon or not.

404
00:27:26,936 --> 00:27:30,565
I think you're impeccable as a judge.

405
00:27:32,692 --> 00:27:34,402
Then trust your own judgement.

406
00:27:35,445 --> 00:27:36,613
That's the answer.

407
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:39,157
Tomorrow's trial...

408
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:42,494
Please take good care of it.

409
00:28:06,434 --> 00:28:07,477
Prosecutor?

410
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:15,777
Defendant Moon Jeongjun has assaulted
his then girlfriend on three occasions

411
00:28:16,444 --> 00:28:19,614
from October 2023 to December 2023.

412
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:22,534
When the victim asked
that they stop seeing each other,

413
00:28:22,617 --> 00:28:24,285
he confined and threatened her.

414
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:28,498
Defendant, do you admit the charges?

415
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:30,583
We admit the assault.

416
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:33,044
But there was no threat.

417
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:36,589
This can be confirmed through
the victim's non-punishment letter.

418
00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:40,427
The victim lied
because she feared retaliation.

419
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:43,638
Your Honor, this is
the prosecution's one-sided speculation.

420
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:45,515
Agreed. Please strike from the record.

421
00:28:45,598 --> 00:28:50,437
We submitted photos taken by the victim
immediately after the assault as evidence.

422
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,063
Let's review them.

423
00:29:28,975 --> 00:29:30,226
Why did you hit her?

424
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:34,063
We were fighting, and before I knew it...

425
00:29:34,147 --> 00:29:35,648
I apologized right away.

426
00:29:35,732 --> 00:29:37,942
But she kept asking to break up
because of it.

427
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:39,736
Before I knew it, my hand was--

428
00:29:39,819 --> 00:29:42,155
Why do you keep saying,
"Before I knew it"?

429
00:29:42,739 --> 00:29:45,116
Are you saying you had no control?

430
00:29:48,077 --> 00:29:49,370
I'm sorry.

431
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:50,497
Defendant,

432
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:54,584
do you admit to assaulting the victim
on three occasions and threatening her?

433
00:29:54,667 --> 00:29:56,503
I did hit her.

434
00:29:57,253 --> 00:29:59,005
But I didn't threaten her.

435
00:29:59,088 --> 00:30:01,883
Saying "then let's die together"
when she asked to break up

436
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:03,092
is not a threat?

437
00:30:03,176 --> 00:30:08,348
Literally, I thought I'd rather die
than break up with Minjeong.

438
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:12,018
Because I love her so much.

439
00:30:12,101 --> 00:30:15,396
It wasn't a threat
but a plea for her to stay.

440
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:20,109
Stop crying, Defendant.

441
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,321
Stop it!

442
00:30:25,281 --> 00:30:28,743
Your Honor, the defendant
grew up in hardship and didn't know

443
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:30,537
how to love in a healthy way.

444
00:30:31,204 --> 00:30:35,083
But his love for the victim is real.

445
00:30:42,423 --> 00:30:44,050
What do you think?

446
00:30:45,134 --> 00:30:48,763
You want her to die because of you, right?

447
00:30:50,265 --> 00:30:51,558
No.

448
00:30:52,183 --> 00:30:54,978
If it's that difficult for Minjeong,

449
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:59,148
I will never go near her again.

450
00:30:59,232 --> 00:31:00,817
You would give up that easily?

451
00:31:02,318 --> 00:31:03,570
Pardon?

452
00:31:04,487 --> 00:31:06,489
No, never mind.

453
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:08,491
Continue.

454
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:12,745
Under Article 264
of the Criminal Act,

455
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:16,583
the prosecution recommends
a one-year imprisonment.

456
00:31:17,917 --> 00:31:20,253
Defendant,
your final statement, please.

457
00:31:25,425 --> 00:31:27,510
I know I won't see her again,

458
00:31:29,512 --> 00:31:32,515
but I want to say
that I really loved Minjeong.

459
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:39,230
I will see you on your sentencing day.

460
00:31:44,944 --> 00:31:47,697
Don't worry. It'll be all right.

461
00:32:00,126 --> 00:32:01,461
I have something to say.

462
00:32:01,544 --> 00:32:04,464
Don't. We don't want to hear it.

463
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:13,973
I'm really sorry.

464
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:22,023
How is Minjeong?

465
00:32:34,577 --> 00:32:36,204
"I know I won't see her again,

466
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:38,831
but I want to say
that I really loved Minjeong."

467
00:32:38,915 --> 00:32:40,959
Barf.

468
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:42,293
JUDGE KANG BITNA

469
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:44,837
So, what will you decide?

470
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:47,840
One year for arguing
that it's love, after beating her.

471
00:32:47,924 --> 00:32:50,718
One year for crying.
So, two years in total.

472
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:53,388
Hmm. Can you do that?
The prosecutor requested one year.

473
00:32:54,013 --> 00:32:56,224
-It's up to me.
-Yes, you're right.

474
00:32:57,058 --> 00:33:00,687
I guess a judge
can do as they please.

475
00:33:01,562 --> 00:33:02,647
Recycle it.

476
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:04,273
Yes, I will.

477
00:33:05,566 --> 00:33:09,237
Anyway, this case just won't work.

478
00:33:10,029 --> 00:33:11,531
It's not that.

479
00:33:11,614 --> 00:33:13,950
I'm sure he's acting, so he's suspicious,

480
00:33:14,033 --> 00:33:15,994
but I don't know what he's plotting.

481
00:33:16,744 --> 00:33:18,830
I won't finish in a year at this rate!

482
00:33:19,914 --> 00:33:24,335
You know, killing a human by trial
isn't the only way to go about it.

483
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:26,629
You think I haven't thought of other ways?

484
00:33:26,713 --> 00:33:29,007
-Don't you know this is the best way?
-Look.

485
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:34,095
First, find a sinner to send to Gehenna
among humans on trial.

486
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:37,306
Second, give them a sentence
much too low for the crime at hand

487
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:38,933
and release them from prison.

488
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:40,977
Third, kill them.

489
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:43,146
This plan is too complicated and perverse.

490
00:33:43,229 --> 00:33:45,481
Get out. I'm busy.

491
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:47,692
What about this?

492
00:33:47,775 --> 00:33:48,776
A serial killer.

493
00:33:49,318 --> 00:33:52,697
If you send to Hell one criminal
who's killed five people,

494
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:55,366
it'll be counted as five.

495
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:59,662
So if you kill just one serial killer
who's murdered ten, it's over.

496
00:33:59,746 --> 00:34:04,125
Is there even a serial killer
with ten victims that hasn't been caught?

497
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:07,378
Probably not.
Since there are so many CCTV cameras.

498
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:17,055
Yes, this is Kang Bitna.

499
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:19,390
- <i>It's Han Daon.</i>
- And?

500
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:23,186
<i>I have something urgent to tell you
about Moon Jeongjun.</i>

501
00:34:25,188 --> 00:34:29,358
I clearly saw Moon Jeongjun
mocking Ms. Cha's parents myself.

502
00:34:29,442 --> 00:34:32,403
If he's released,
he will commit another crime.

503
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:34,238
Do you really think so?

504
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:37,450
That if Moon Jeongjun is released,
he'll find the victim and--

505
00:34:37,533 --> 00:34:39,911
We don't know what he might do then.

506
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:42,914
-Worst case--
-He might kill her.

507
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:45,083
The defendant.

508
00:34:47,376 --> 00:34:51,172
I'd like you to sentence Moon
with the maximum penalty allowed by law.

509
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:54,342
You do know
you're overstepping here, right?

510
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:55,468
Yes.

511
00:34:55,551 --> 00:34:57,678
Yet you still came to see me. Why?

512
00:34:57,762 --> 00:34:59,222
You said that

513
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:04,143
it's the judge's job to uncover the truth
and punish the bad guys properly.

514
00:35:04,227 --> 00:35:06,854
I just wanted to tell you
there's something else

515
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:09,023
that wasn't revealed in court.

516
00:35:12,735 --> 00:35:15,071
Let me speak with Cha Minjeong's parents.

517
00:35:15,154 --> 00:35:16,531
Alone, without you.

518
00:35:17,281 --> 00:35:19,283
I want to hear it for myself as the judge.

519
00:35:19,867 --> 00:35:23,287
The victim and her family's true story.

520
00:35:29,877 --> 00:35:30,878
Ah.

521
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:33,965
Excuse me. Another cola, please.

522
00:35:34,048 --> 00:35:35,258
Of course.

523
00:35:35,341 --> 00:35:38,302
-Our meeting today must remain a secret.
-Yes.

524
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:40,096
Tell me about Moon Jeongjun.

525
00:35:40,179 --> 00:35:42,598
I heard he mocked you after the trial.

526
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:45,643
He apologized to us, and then...

527
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:48,062
asked after Minjeong.

528
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:50,148
It was terrifying.

529
00:35:50,231 --> 00:35:53,276
His demeanor
was completely different in front of you.

530
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:56,279
What about the non-punishment letter
submitted by Ms. Cha?

531
00:35:56,362 --> 00:35:58,156
She was afraid.

532
00:35:59,907 --> 00:36:02,034
<i>It won't make a difference.</i>

533
00:36:03,703 --> 00:36:06,122
He won't stay locked up long.
He'll be right out.

534
00:36:06,706 --> 00:36:08,749
So why did you report him?

535
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:11,043
You shouldn't have.

536
00:36:17,884 --> 00:36:19,635
That was the last time.

537
00:36:20,386 --> 00:36:22,555
She won't even answer our calls now.

538
00:36:22,638 --> 00:36:24,682
Even if he receives
a maximum sentence,

539
00:36:24,765 --> 00:36:26,934
I heard he won't stay in long.

540
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:30,396
Then what will happen to our Minjeong?

541
00:36:30,479 --> 00:36:34,442
She'll have to live
in fear of him forever.

542
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:39,030
So you're sure Moon Jeongjun
will come after Ms. Cha?

543
00:36:39,113 --> 00:36:41,616
Yes, I'm sure.

544
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:50,082
Ma'am, please save our daughter.

545
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:53,336
You're the only one who can.

546
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:57,340
Excuse me.

547
00:37:10,811 --> 00:37:12,063
<i>This is it, now!</i>

548
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:16,275
I'm so sorry for upsetting you...

549
00:37:17,193 --> 00:37:18,861
No, it's fine.

550
00:37:18,945 --> 00:37:20,238
I didn't want to cry,

551
00:37:21,113 --> 00:37:23,741
but it was so heartbreaking
that I couldn't help it.

552
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:25,534
I shouldn't be like this.

553
00:37:26,285 --> 00:37:27,870
Stop flowing, tears!

554
00:37:27,954 --> 00:37:31,332
Thank you so much.

555
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:33,709
For listening to our side of the story

556
00:37:33,793 --> 00:37:35,336
and crying with us.

557
00:37:35,962 --> 00:37:37,797
I'm even more grateful.

558
00:37:39,006 --> 00:37:41,425
How dare he toy
with the judge's conscience?

559
00:37:42,009 --> 00:37:44,720
I'll make sure he gets what he deserves.

560
00:37:44,804 --> 00:37:47,974
Thank you. Thank you so much.

561
00:37:50,017 --> 00:37:53,896
Then, would you mind telling me

562
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:58,025
what happened between
Moon Jeongjun and Ms. Cha?

563
00:37:58,526 --> 00:37:59,735
All of it.

564
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:12,748
Hey, Eunseop.

565
00:38:12,832 --> 00:38:16,252
Don't you know there's
a hierarchy when it comes to hot coffee?

566
00:38:16,335 --> 00:38:18,087
No, I've never heard of that.

567
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:25,553
Yes, this is Han Daon.

568
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:28,389
You were together for five hours?

569
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:31,017
Judge Kang cried?

570
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:35,980
Because she was so heartbroken?

571
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:46,157
-Judge Kang.
-Hello, Chief.

572
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:49,201
If you apologize now, I'll forgive you.

573
00:38:49,285 --> 00:38:52,663
-What?
-You humiliated the prosecution in court.

574
00:38:53,247 --> 00:38:54,623
Oh, that?

575
00:38:54,707 --> 00:38:57,877
They wanted to make this an issue,
and I barely stopped them.

576
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:00,504
Then why do something humiliating
in the first place?

577
00:39:01,881 --> 00:39:04,008
I heard you told
a bunch of kindergarteners

578
00:39:04,091 --> 00:39:07,178
that there was no justice.
That you shouted it!

579
00:39:07,261 --> 00:39:08,554
Should a judge say that?

580
00:39:08,637 --> 00:39:10,473
But it's true there is no justice.

581
00:39:13,726 --> 00:39:16,395
Judge Kang, if a judge wears
that much makeup,

582
00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:18,606
what would people think?

583
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:20,483
That I'm pretty?

584
00:39:22,276 --> 00:39:24,445
What do you think? I'm pretty, right?

585
00:39:24,528 --> 00:39:25,654
Yes.

586
00:39:25,738 --> 00:39:28,199
This look, way of speaking, and demeanor,

587
00:39:28,783 --> 00:39:31,369
it's not like you at all.

588
00:39:31,452 --> 00:39:34,330
I won't ask what I'm like. It's tedious.

589
00:39:34,413 --> 00:39:35,706
And I don't really care.

590
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:39,710
-What?
-I'm kind of busy and should get going.

591
00:39:42,546 --> 00:39:44,548
If it weren't for Assemblyman Jeong...

592
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:47,259
How can someone change that much?

593
00:39:47,843 --> 00:39:50,221
It was a traumatic accident.

594
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:56,143
Unsolved serial murders...

595
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:58,187
SERIAL MURDERS IN THE UK...

596
00:39:59,647 --> 00:40:01,023
Shouldn't you get off work?

597
00:40:01,107 --> 00:40:03,025
Order in spicy tofu soup.
I'm working late.

598
00:40:03,526 --> 00:40:05,236
JUDGE'S OFFICE

599
00:40:06,862 --> 00:40:09,657
What is it?
Seeing her smile makes me uneasy.

600
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:13,327
AGGRAVATED ASSAULT...

601
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:20,418
Did something good happen?

602
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:22,336
I finally got someone.

603
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:25,589
His name is Moon Jeongjun.

604
00:40:26,048 --> 00:40:27,049
Didn't you let that one go?

605
00:40:34,557 --> 00:40:37,101
But that's a bit too brutal for humans.

606
00:40:37,184 --> 00:40:39,019
Who cares? You're not human.

607
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:41,522
And we can't be worrying
about others right now.

608
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:43,899
Don't you remember
what that spider did to me?

609
00:40:46,235 --> 00:40:47,987
If you don't complete it,

610
00:40:48,529 --> 00:40:50,114
you will die.

611
00:40:50,906 --> 00:40:52,283
Do you want to die?

612
00:40:54,577 --> 00:40:57,288
Get some omelets, too. With cheese.

613
00:40:57,913 --> 00:40:58,914
Yes, ma'am.

614
00:41:14,346 --> 00:41:16,265
Please take your seats.

615
00:41:23,772 --> 00:41:27,151
Case number 2024GoDan175.

616
00:41:27,234 --> 00:41:29,945
I'll pronounce the verdict
on the defendant.

617
00:41:31,447 --> 00:41:34,742
Moon Jeongjun
was in a relationship with the victim

618
00:41:34,825 --> 00:41:37,328
during which
he continuously assaulted her.

619
00:41:37,411 --> 00:41:39,538
The victim wanted to end the relationship,

620
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:43,000
but the defendant only assaulted
the victim in a more brutal way.

621
00:41:43,083 --> 00:41:45,461
The defendant treated the victim
as his property

622
00:41:45,544 --> 00:41:49,006
rather than an independent person,
which is a serious criminal offense.

623
00:41:49,757 --> 00:41:52,843
Therefore, the defendant shall not
avoid severe punishment.

624
00:41:55,554 --> 00:41:58,349
However, that the victim
appealed for leniency

625
00:41:58,432 --> 00:42:01,894
and the defendant
promised to right his wrongs

626
00:42:01,977 --> 00:42:03,395
shall be considered.

627
00:42:03,479 --> 00:42:06,732
Also, the defendant
is deeply regretful of his actions

628
00:42:06,815 --> 00:42:08,943
and is a first-time offender.

629
00:42:09,026 --> 00:42:11,987
Depriving the young defendant of a chance

630
00:42:12,071 --> 00:42:14,532
to live
as a contributing member of society

631
00:42:15,282 --> 00:42:17,326
would be cruel.

632
00:42:18,577 --> 00:42:22,373
Thus, the court's ruling is as follows.

633
00:42:23,999 --> 00:42:26,502
The defendant, Moon Jeongjun,
is hereby ordered...

634
00:42:29,755 --> 00:42:32,633
to pay a fine of three million won.

635
00:42:32,716 --> 00:42:34,552
- What?
- That's ridiculous.

636
00:42:34,635 --> 00:42:39,223
What? A fine? That's absurd.

637
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:44,311
What? That's...

638
00:42:50,442 --> 00:42:52,987
Thank you,
Your Honor. Thank you.

639
00:42:56,532 --> 00:42:57,533
Thank you!

640
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:19,430
Honey.

641
00:43:20,139 --> 00:43:22,433
This doesn't make sense.

642
00:43:23,058 --> 00:43:25,853
What about our Minjeong?
Oh, no.

643
00:43:30,816 --> 00:43:32,818
Judge Kang. Judge Kang Bitna!

644
00:43:33,694 --> 00:43:36,071
I know what you're going to say. Don't.

645
00:43:36,155 --> 00:43:37,906
I only ruled according to the law.

646
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:39,742
That was according to the law?

647
00:43:39,825 --> 00:43:42,286
Who is this law for anyways?

648
00:43:42,369 --> 00:43:44,288
The victim already forgave the assailant.

649
00:43:44,371 --> 00:43:46,457
What more should the law have done?

650
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:49,084
You know it's because
she feared he'd retaliate.

651
00:43:49,168 --> 00:43:52,796
Shouldn't the judge take
the victim's feelings into consideration?

652
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:56,800
A judge isn't a psychological counselor
or a mind reader.

653
00:43:56,884 --> 00:43:59,553
Didn't you sympathize
with their pain and grief?

654
00:44:00,137 --> 00:44:03,015
So you lied when you said
he'd get what he deserved?

655
00:44:04,933 --> 00:44:06,185
You're adorable.

656
00:44:06,268 --> 00:44:09,438
Like a little puppy barking at the law
which should be feared.

657
00:44:09,521 --> 00:44:12,399
-What?
-I didn't sympathize with them.

658
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:15,027
Nor did I feel any compassion
for the victim.

659
00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:17,488
I think I might have teared up
because I yawned.

660
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:21,659
But I wasn't lying
when I said he'd get what he deserved.

661
00:44:21,742 --> 00:44:24,495
And a mere fine is what he deserved?

662
00:44:24,912 --> 00:44:26,121
Think what you like.

663
00:44:26,538 --> 00:44:27,539
Ah...

664
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:29,625
I'll walk you another time.

665
00:44:29,708 --> 00:44:31,669
I'm going to be busy for a while.

666
00:44:45,849 --> 00:44:51,355
SEOUL CENTRAL DETENTION CENTER

667
00:44:56,944 --> 00:44:58,696
Why are you here, Detective?

668
00:45:11,166 --> 00:45:13,168
Go on. Eat up.

669
00:45:16,046 --> 00:45:17,256
What did you say?

670
00:45:17,339 --> 00:45:19,591
I got you locked up in here.

671
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:22,678
Yet you're free with only a mere fine.
It feels...

672
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:24,638
pretty crappy.

673
00:45:27,766 --> 00:45:31,353
Don't come anywhere near Cha Minjeong.

674
00:45:31,854 --> 00:45:33,564
Lie low and don't make a peep.

675
00:45:33,647 --> 00:45:35,274
Are you threatening me?

676
00:45:36,817 --> 00:45:38,360
No, just some advice for you.

677
00:45:39,069 --> 00:45:43,073
A warning that the law
won't forgive you twice.

678
00:45:45,117 --> 00:45:46,118
Hey.

679
00:45:48,871 --> 00:45:50,289
When I get angry,

680
00:45:51,582 --> 00:45:54,585
there's no telling what I might do.

681
00:45:56,879 --> 00:45:57,880
Be good.

682
00:45:59,089 --> 00:46:00,591
-Okay.
-Good.

683
00:46:02,301 --> 00:46:03,677
Clean this up.

684
00:46:31,747 --> 00:46:34,208
Minjeong,
it's Mom. Open the door.

685
00:46:34,291 --> 00:46:35,292
Go away.

686
00:46:36,335 --> 00:46:39,713
Minjeong, you can't stay here.

687
00:46:39,797 --> 00:46:41,924
Come with Mom and Dad, okay?

688
00:46:42,007 --> 00:46:44,760
Stop calling
or coming to see me.

689
00:46:44,843 --> 00:46:47,471
Go! Just leave!

690
00:46:48,055 --> 00:46:51,725
Minjeong, please.

691
00:46:53,602 --> 00:46:56,480
Minjeong, we'll do as you say.

692
00:46:56,563 --> 00:47:01,401
But if you want to come home,
call me anytime, okay?

693
00:47:01,485 --> 00:47:02,903
I'm come get you right away.

694
00:47:03,821 --> 00:47:07,699
We stopped by that bakery you like
and picked up some bread.

695
00:47:07,783 --> 00:47:09,201
Make sure you eat.

696
00:47:09,284 --> 00:47:13,038
But don't eat too fast.
You'll get indigestion.

697
00:47:14,081 --> 00:47:16,041
Have it with some milk, too.

698
00:47:29,805 --> 00:47:32,391
Ms. Cha. Don't worry too much.

699
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:35,644
I'm leaving a smart watch by your door.

700
00:47:35,727 --> 00:47:38,772
If you press the SOS button,
we'll come right away.

701
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:25,944
COURT

702
00:48:28,864 --> 00:48:32,492
EVEN IF THE HEAVENS FALL,
THERE WILL BE JUSTICE ON EARTH

703
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:13,909
THE SAME PLACE CAN BE HEAVEN OR HELL

704
00:49:13,992 --> 00:49:15,869
Yes, all right.

705
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:18,455
Gosh, it's already lunchtime.

706
00:49:18,538 --> 00:49:20,832
I'm going to go check up on Cha Minjeong.

707
00:49:22,042 --> 00:49:25,170
But should it be the detective's
job to guard a victim's home

708
00:49:25,253 --> 00:49:26,380
day and night?

709
00:49:26,463 --> 00:49:29,299
I'm not guarding the victim's home.
I'm protecting them.

710
00:49:30,342 --> 00:49:32,052
Eunseop has a point.

711
00:49:32,886 --> 00:49:34,596
We've done everything we can do.

712
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:37,808
We've requested protective custody
and increased patrols in the area.

713
00:49:37,891 --> 00:49:39,893
And Moon Jeongjun's
been quiet for two weeks.

714
00:49:39,977 --> 00:49:41,395
That's what makes me nervous.

715
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:44,481
Look, aren't you going to
work on other cases?

716
00:49:44,564 --> 00:49:47,734
He's not human.
We don't know what he might do or when.

717
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:49,319
You're right.

718
00:49:49,403 --> 00:49:52,406
But how long are you
going to keep this up?

719
00:49:52,489 --> 00:49:54,449
Gosh, what a headache.

720
00:49:55,158 --> 00:49:56,910
-Daon.
-Yes?

721
00:49:56,994 --> 00:50:00,497
Starting today, only check in
on Ms. Cha once in the evening.

722
00:50:00,580 --> 00:50:01,623
But...

723
00:50:01,707 --> 00:50:04,292
If this could be stopped by one officer,

724
00:50:04,376 --> 00:50:06,211
I'd ask you to stay there forever.

725
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:08,839
But you know what the reality is.

726
00:50:08,922 --> 00:50:11,883
While you're there,
another incident will occur elsewhere.

727
00:50:11,967 --> 00:50:13,760
And there will be another victim.

728
00:50:14,594 --> 00:50:16,054
I know how you feel.

729
00:50:16,847 --> 00:50:18,849
Because I feel the same.

730
00:51:02,184 --> 00:51:04,436
Dad, it's me.

731
00:51:04,519 --> 00:51:06,688
<i>Minjeong. What is it?</i>

732
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:09,941
Can you come get me?

733
00:51:14,446 --> 00:51:16,656
<i>This is driving me crazy.</i>

734
00:51:18,617 --> 00:51:19,659
Damn it.

735
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:21,244
Why is he so quiet?

736
00:51:22,162 --> 00:51:23,163
Me?

737
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:26,374
Not you. Moon Jeongjun.

738
00:51:26,458 --> 00:51:27,459
Right.

739
00:51:29,044 --> 00:51:30,754
Maybe he's really remorseful.

740
00:51:32,422 --> 00:51:35,050
Or if you do that thing,

741
00:51:35,133 --> 00:51:37,260
you can know what he's doing.

742
00:51:37,344 --> 00:51:38,678
That thing?

743
00:52:02,536 --> 00:52:05,163
MOON JEONGJUN

744
00:52:37,529 --> 00:52:38,530
Are you going home?

745
00:52:39,614 --> 00:52:41,283
No, I'm just starting work.

746
00:52:44,327 --> 00:52:46,163
I'm going home.

747
00:52:48,498 --> 00:52:49,666
For recycling.

748
00:53:02,053 --> 00:53:03,138
Is it you, Dad?

749
00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:19,821
Who is it?

750
00:53:19,905 --> 00:53:22,199
It's the police. Is everything okay?

751
00:53:24,576 --> 00:53:25,827
Yes.

752
00:53:25,911 --> 00:53:27,245
But what brings you by?

753
00:53:27,329 --> 00:53:29,915
Detective Han asked me
to bring you something.

754
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:39,090
Can you just leave it by the door?

755
00:53:39,174 --> 00:53:40,383
Okay.

756
00:53:57,692 --> 00:54:00,070
I missed you, Minjeong.

757
00:54:04,741 --> 00:54:05,825
Hey.

758
00:54:16,753 --> 00:54:18,046
Where are you going?

759
00:54:18,129 --> 00:54:20,882
Why didn't you open the door?

760
00:54:23,093 --> 00:54:25,595
Give it. Did that Detective Han
give you this?

761
00:54:26,888 --> 00:54:28,181
What's he to you?

762
00:54:28,265 --> 00:54:31,184
I told you not to see other guys,
didn't I?

763
00:54:32,936 --> 00:54:34,104
Come here.

764
00:54:34,813 --> 00:54:37,524
-Stop!
-Why didn't you open the door?

765
00:54:37,607 --> 00:54:38,608
Why?

766
00:54:44,030 --> 00:54:45,573
-Stop.
-How have you been?

767
00:54:45,657 --> 00:54:50,328
I just asked you how you've been.

768
00:54:55,583 --> 00:54:57,002
Didn't you miss me?

769
00:54:57,961 --> 00:55:00,088
Answer me. Didn't you miss me?

770
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:03,591
Please, stop.

771
00:55:30,577 --> 00:55:36,499
MOON JEONGJUN

772
00:55:48,136 --> 00:55:50,555
You said you'd leave me alone

773
00:55:50,638 --> 00:55:52,682
if I wrote the non-punishment letter.

774
00:55:53,266 --> 00:55:56,936
I did. But I missed you too much.

775
00:55:59,814 --> 00:56:01,232
Let me go.

776
00:56:02,025 --> 00:56:04,152
Please, let me go.

777
00:56:05,570 --> 00:56:07,113
Okay, I will.

778
00:56:08,156 --> 00:56:09,324
But...

779
00:56:19,125 --> 00:56:20,752
Can I kill your parents instead?

780
00:56:23,129 --> 00:56:27,217
If you call the police again
or crawl back to your parents' house...

781
00:56:31,346 --> 00:56:33,473
I'm going to beat your dad up, too.

782
00:56:39,020 --> 00:56:40,021
How pretty.

783
00:56:40,105 --> 00:56:41,356
LOVE YOU TO DEATH
MINE FOREVER!

784
00:56:41,439 --> 00:56:44,275
I'll be back. Stay pretty.

785
00:57:30,655 --> 00:57:31,656
She's dead.

786
00:57:56,181 --> 00:57:57,849
Did something good happen?

787
00:58:04,522 --> 00:58:06,149
Are you coming from somewhere?

788
00:58:08,943 --> 00:58:10,695
Aren't you the judge?

789
00:58:12,197 --> 00:58:14,073
I was just down the street.

790
00:58:16,993 --> 00:58:18,661
But what brings you here?

791
00:58:20,872 --> 00:58:23,208
Shall we go talk somewhere quiet?

792
00:58:23,291 --> 00:58:26,252
What would we have to talk about?

793
00:58:27,921 --> 00:58:31,174
Come on. It won't be long.

794
00:59:35,154 --> 00:59:37,657
The Judge from Hell

795
00:59:37,740 --> 00:59:40,994
<i>Gehenna</i>

796
00:59:43,288 --> 00:59:44,747
What's Heaven like?

797
00:59:44,831 --> 00:59:46,457
I've never been there.

798
00:59:46,541 --> 00:59:49,127
Then is Hell a scary place
as we've imagined it?

799
00:59:50,753 --> 00:59:52,714
It's breathtakingly beautiful.

800
00:59:53,298 --> 00:59:54,507
Like me.

801
00:59:59,512 --> 01:00:03,182
<i>All humans desire
to walk through a field of flowers.</i>

802
01:00:04,309 --> 01:00:06,644
<i>But you shouldn't be fooled by the beauty.</i>

803
01:00:07,353 --> 01:00:09,063
<i>It's actually very dangerous.</i>

804
01:00:09,689 --> 01:00:10,690
Like me.

805
01:00:12,275 --> 01:00:14,068
<i>The moment you touch a flower...</i>

806
01:00:16,904 --> 01:00:19,741
<i>...you'll see the Hell in your mind.</i>

807
01:00:44,849 --> 01:00:46,559
<i>But no need to be afraid.</i>

808
01:00:47,435 --> 01:00:49,520
<i>The Hell you'll go to
after death is scary.</i>

809
01:00:49,604 --> 01:00:52,231
<i>But it's not as bad as
the Hell you face while living.</i>

810
01:00:52,815 --> 01:00:54,859
This place you all live in

811
01:00:54,942 --> 01:00:58,613
is the real Hell
filled with demon-like humans.

812
01:00:58,696 --> 01:01:00,740
You claim to be a demon.

813
01:01:00,823 --> 01:01:02,408
I am a demon.

814
01:01:02,492 --> 01:01:04,744
Yes, you're a demon.

815
01:01:04,827 --> 01:01:07,330
I wonder why a demon came here from Hell.

816
01:01:07,413 --> 01:01:10,792
Because you yearn for the human world?
Or you want to be human?

817
01:01:10,875 --> 01:01:13,044
Of course not.

818
01:01:13,127 --> 01:01:16,547
There's nothing I hate more than humans.

819
01:01:44,367 --> 01:01:45,368
Tribunate

820
01:02:00,717 --> 01:02:02,135
Hey, wait.

821
01:02:04,053 --> 01:02:05,638
You're Kang Bitna.

822
01:02:06,139 --> 01:02:07,390
The human who escaped.

823
01:02:09,100 --> 01:02:11,185
GREMORY
WARDEN OF DISTRICT 3, FAKE HELL

824
01:04:04,757 --> 01:04:06,425
Why did Kang Bitna die?

825
01:04:06,509 --> 01:04:09,136
I don't know. But I heard she got stabbed.

826
01:04:09,220 --> 01:04:11,138
What sin did she commit to deserve Hell?

827
01:04:13,140 --> 01:04:15,226
Do I have to tell you that, too?

828
01:04:35,204 --> 01:04:39,083
{\an8}<i>Countless people have lost
their lives from cases like this.</i>

829
01:04:39,166 --> 01:04:40,251
{\an8}Is that my fault?

830
01:04:40,334 --> 01:04:41,752
{\an8}What happened to Minjeong?

831
01:04:41,836 --> 01:04:43,671
{\an8}<i>See the results of your ruling?</i>

832
01:04:43,754 --> 01:04:45,590
{\an8}<i>Han Daon's
the bigger problem.</i>

833
01:04:45,673 --> 01:04:46,924
{\an8}<i>I feel like he keeps getting in my way.</i>

834
01:04:47,008 --> 01:04:50,261
{\an8}I've really killed before.
Three people, in fact.

835
01:04:50,344 --> 01:04:54,265
{\an8}You are about to be
on the receiving end of what you've done.

836
01:04:54,348 --> 01:04:56,893
{\an8}You'll be the one to regret, you bitch!

837
01:04:57,602 --> 01:05:00,229
{\an8}<i>You'll never be free of me.</i>

838
01:05:00,313 --> 01:05:03,482
{\an8}<i>I told you. This is your real trial.</i>
