THE JUDGE FROM HELL

2
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:33,908
CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:00:33,992 --> 00:00:35,952
CHILD ACTORS AND ANIMALS
FILMED IN SAFE ENVIRONMENT

4
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:41,768
I give my life
to summon the Demon of Death.

5
00:01:41,851 --> 00:01:43,186
Bael.

6
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:35,405
Bael.

7
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,699
A lowly demon like you

8
00:02:38,741 --> 00:02:40,493
has dared to summon me.

9
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:44,873
A lowly demon...

10
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:47,959
Venato.

11
00:02:48,042 --> 00:02:49,377
Venato.

12
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:54,215
A human is interfering with Justitia.

13
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:56,926
Please kill that man.

14
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,595
What is his name?

15
00:03:00,096 --> 00:03:01,181
Han Daon.

16
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:03,850
Paimon.

17
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:25,538
EPISODE 10

18
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:29,250
Damn it. My knees hurt, you bastard!

19
00:03:37,508 --> 00:03:39,344
I told you my knees hurt, you punk.

20
00:03:40,845 --> 00:03:43,765
No use in running away
in this small county. Okay?

21
00:03:43,848 --> 00:03:45,475
Be quiet, asshole!

22
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:36,401
We have a new transfer
from another station.

23
00:04:36,484 --> 00:04:38,486
I requested he be assigned to our team.

24
00:04:38,569 --> 00:04:40,822
He should be here any moment.
There he comes.

25
00:04:40,905 --> 00:04:43,908
Hello, I'm Detective Jang Munjae.

26
00:04:44,909 --> 00:04:46,369
Lieutenant Han Daon.

27
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:49,289
I've heard a lot about you.

28
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:50,498
Chin up.

29
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:58,089
Judge Kang tries over 200 cases a month.

30
00:04:58,172 --> 00:04:59,882
Have all those 200 died?

31
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:00,967
My apologies.

32
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:06,014
Kang...

33
00:05:06,097 --> 00:05:07,265
Banjjak?

34
00:05:08,057 --> 00:05:09,183
No, that's not it.

35
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:10,518
Kang Bitna.

36
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:12,103
Kang Bitna.

37
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:14,105
What kind of person is she?

38
00:05:14,188 --> 00:05:18,609
She doesn't let the strong push her around
or walk over the weak.

39
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:23,156
She may seem cold from a distance,
but up close she's very warm.

40
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:26,242
She sounds very humane,

41
00:05:27,076 --> 00:05:29,287
this Kang Bitna.

42
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:34,792
I saw you.

43
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:36,586
You deleted it on purpose.

44
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:39,797
You're an officer
but destroyed evidence for her.

45
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:44,052
You must really like
this Judge Kang Bitna.

46
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:57,357
I'll keep this a secret for now.

47
00:05:58,149 --> 00:05:59,817
If you do what I say.

48
00:06:05,114 --> 00:06:06,324
I'm sorry.

49
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:09,035
I made a mistake.
I'll watch him, and if I can't...

50
00:06:09,118 --> 00:06:11,371
If you can't? Will you kill him?

51
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:12,872
If I need to.

52
00:06:12,955 --> 00:06:14,207
Give me his number.

53
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:17,210
What are you going to do?

54
00:06:17,293 --> 00:06:20,338
He wants to meet me. I should.

55
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:07,760
Nice to meet you.

56
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:09,846
I'm Detective Jang Munjae.

57
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:24,444
THE JUDGE FROM HELL

58
00:07:26,737 --> 00:07:28,322
You like cola, I see.

59
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:31,367
And you like threats, I see.

60
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,161
It's a request.

61
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:35,746
If you want to use the video
to question me, go ahead.

62
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,582
But you won't get anything.

63
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:40,543
My alibi for that day is perfect.

64
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:43,087
Do you like Detective Han Daon?

65
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:47,008
He seemed to like you.

66
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:48,926
What does that have to do with the case?

67
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,595
How much do you love him?

68
00:07:50,678 --> 00:07:53,723
- Listen here...
- Enough to give up everything?

69
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:57,435
Including your life?

70
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:03,483
Do whatever you want with that footage.

71
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:04,901
Except one thing.

72
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:08,779
Don't threaten
Detective Han Daon with it again.

73
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:13,784
This is also a request.

74
00:08:22,418 --> 00:08:23,628
You were right.

75
00:08:23,711 --> 00:08:25,963
Han Daon knows everything.

76
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:28,132
And yet he's covering for her.

77
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:30,343
Then as Bael ordered,

78
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:33,304
please kill Han Daon.

79
00:08:33,387 --> 00:08:35,306
Of course.

80
00:08:36,557 --> 00:08:40,061
In the most painful...

81
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:42,104
and brutal way possible.

82
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:54,825
On July 8, 2024,
the defendant, Jeong Seonho,

83
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:57,370
drove under the influence of drugs
and crashed his car

84
00:08:57,453 --> 00:09:00,331
into a transformer
in front of Hwangcheon Middle School.

85
00:09:00,414 --> 00:09:02,792
This is not
the defendant's first time using drugs.

86
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:05,670
And the incident occurred
in a school zone.

87
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:08,798
Considering this,
the punishment must be severe.

88
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:11,842
However, the defendant
is deeply remorseful

89
00:09:12,426 --> 00:09:15,638
and has repeatedly stated
that he will not use drugs again.

90
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:18,724
Also, he's paid for all damages
caused by the incident.

91
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:21,686
And there were no casualties
in the accident.

92
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:24,397
These are mitigating circumstances
in the defendant's favor.

93
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,816
Taking all of these points
into consideration,

94
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:29,527
the court shall rule as follows.

95
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:32,029
The defendant, Jeong Seonho,

96
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:36,909
shall be sentenced to two years in prison
and four years' probation.

97
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:39,370
COUNSEL, DEFENDANT

98
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:24,332
Are you worried about something?

99
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:28,544
What? Me? Why do you ask?

100
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:30,880
You look off these days.

101
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:32,840
He always looks off.

102
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,301
That's true.

103
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:40,181
He's been released.
Now you just have to hunt him down.

104
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:43,559
When will you kill him?

105
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:46,604
Should I go first this time too
and make him unconscious?

106
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:50,232
This one's on hold for now.

107
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:52,401
What? Why?

108
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:57,114
He's serial killer J. And you saw him
killing the police officer.

109
00:10:57,198 --> 00:11:01,327
To be exact, not killing her
but standing there before she died.

110
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:02,536
That means

111
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,789
he probably killed her.

112
00:11:05,414 --> 00:11:06,499
No.

113
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:09,919
J has never killed with a gun before.

114
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:12,922
Then we should torture him to find out.

115
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:15,883
Even if it's not true,
he's still a killer. So you can kill him.

116
00:11:15,966 --> 00:11:17,635
There's nothing for you to lose.

117
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:19,220
In any case, I will be

118
00:11:20,262 --> 00:11:22,556
more cautious with this case.

119
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:27,478
Because the dead officer
was close to Han Daon?

120
00:11:32,274 --> 00:11:34,568
Is that why you want to be more certain?

121
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:37,196
It's not that.

122
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:40,366
Oh, right.

123
00:11:41,742 --> 00:11:43,202
I'm saying this just in case.

124
00:11:43,285 --> 00:11:45,162
Leave Han Daon alone.

125
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:47,915
Of course. Why wouldn't we?

126
00:11:48,624 --> 00:11:49,625
Good, then.

127
00:11:56,465 --> 00:11:57,883
Gremory...

128
00:11:57,967 --> 00:12:00,261
- Aren't you going with her?
- Oh, right.

129
00:12:13,023 --> 00:12:16,777
Moon Jeongjun, one. Bae Jayeong, two.
Yang Seungbin, three.

130
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:18,904
Choi Wonjoong, one.

131
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:21,490
J, 13.

132
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:25,870
That's 20.

133
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:32,793
RETURN TO HELL

134
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:42,511
What will you do
about Hwangcheon?

135
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:45,389
The landlady won't meet with me,
so I'll approach her daughter.

136
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:47,433
This is taking longer than I thought.

137
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:56,275
I'm sorry. I'll move quickly.

138
00:12:58,986 --> 00:13:02,948
Anyway, it seems something is going on
with Judge Kang Bitna.

139
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:12,249
Hey.

140
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,543
Hey! What the...

141
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:17,087
If you feel upset, sue me.
I'm Judge Kang Bitna...

142
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:21,967
So? Are you going to help her again?

143
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:25,721
She helped with Seonho's case,
so I should.

144
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:36,273
What exactly do you mean
I should protect Han Daon?

145
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:41,862
Stop eating and tell me, damn it.

146
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:48,244
How you protect Han Daon,
that's for you to figure out.

147
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:51,747
What's certain is, either you or Han Daon

148
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:53,999
will die.

149
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,381
Wait.

150
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:04,677
If I complete my mission
and go back to Hell,

151
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,804
the Kang Bitna here will become a corpse.

152
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:09,932
Which means she dies and Han Daon lives.

153
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:11,058
Right? Is that it?

154
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:13,686
You are slow indeed.

155
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:15,646
Are all demons stupid like you?

156
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:17,606
Fine, I'm stupid.

157
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:20,359
If you know that, just tell me what to do.

158
00:14:23,904 --> 00:14:25,406
Fine. Let's say I'm stupid.

159
00:14:25,489 --> 00:14:27,825
If I go back to Hell,
what happens to Han Daon?

160
00:14:28,742 --> 00:14:29,785
Does he die?

161
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:31,704
But why? He's innocent.

162
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:35,833
If you're curious, go back.

163
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:37,084
Damn it.

164
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:38,794
You little... Follow me out.

165
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:41,672
Follow me out! Now!

166
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:43,716
Excuse me. You should

167
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:45,384
watch your tone with your elders.

168
00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:49,805
Do you know me? Or this hag?

169
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:51,557
Mind your own business.

170
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:55,728
Are you okay, ma'am?

171
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:58,981
You should die when you're too old.

172
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:03,903
Maybe I've lived too long.

173
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:07,781
If you know that, just die. Die now!

174
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:09,366
That's enough.

175
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:11,869
Ma'am. Where's your home?
Shall I take you there?

176
00:15:11,952 --> 00:15:14,038
What a nice young man.

177
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:15,873
You will be blessed.

178
00:15:15,956 --> 00:15:19,001
Can you just take me down
to the first floor?

179
00:15:24,506 --> 00:15:28,761
My, my. Look at that fake
putting on a show.

180
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,681
Damn it.

181
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:34,099
Goodness.

182
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:42,566
"It was found that Judge Kang,

183
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:45,486
who recently sparked controversy
at a restaurant

184
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:48,614
for misconduct involving
young men in their 20s,

185
00:15:48,697 --> 00:15:50,866
is the same judge who handed down

186
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:55,037
an overly lenient sentence to
Assemblyman Jeong Jaegeol's second son."

187
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:03,545
Judge Kang. Do you owe this reporter
money or something?

188
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:05,339
Their last article was like this, too.

189
00:16:05,422 --> 00:16:08,467
All the other reporters are quiet,
but why just this one?

190
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:10,344
What a true reporter.

191
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:13,889
I'm on your side, Judge Kang.

192
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:17,434
Don't be. I don't want
to be on the same side as you.

193
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:21,188
You know the men you humiliated in public
have sued you, right?

194
00:16:21,271 --> 00:16:24,274
- Yes.
- But they withdrew.

195
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:27,903
And they promised to take down
the video and comments. Do you know why?

196
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,363
Do I need to know?

197
00:16:29,446 --> 00:16:33,867
Assemblyman Jeong gave them a lot of money

198
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:35,536
and took care of the situation.

199
00:16:35,619 --> 00:16:38,706
Because he was grateful for your help
on his son's case.

200
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:39,790
And?

201
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:45,838
With this article out there,
we can't just ignore the situation.

202
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:47,798
Take a month off.

203
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:49,800
Wow.

204
00:16:49,883 --> 00:16:53,512
So even if you take a stranger's phone
and break it, all you get

205
00:16:53,595 --> 00:16:55,347
is a one-month suspension?

206
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:57,850
Being a judge is the best.

207
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:01,979
But can I take a longer break?

208
00:17:02,062 --> 00:17:03,689
- I have lots to do.
- Get out.

209
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:07,067
Okay.

210
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:16,535
I'm suspended for a month.

211
00:17:16,618 --> 00:17:18,996
- What? A month?
- Yes.

212
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:21,123
I knew this day would come.

213
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:22,207
You must be upset.

214
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:24,585
- What will you do on your break?
- I have important...

215
00:17:24,668 --> 00:17:25,669
This is 18th Criminal Division.

216
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:29,048
Our judge is suspended.
Do I have to come to work?

217
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:31,133
Oh, is that so?

218
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:34,928
All right.

219
00:17:36,972 --> 00:17:38,307
She's gone.

220
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:43,896
Oh. We heard the news. That's terrible.

221
00:17:43,979 --> 00:17:45,481
Don't pretend to feel bad for me.

222
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:47,357
Well, all right then.

223
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:49,777
Use this opportunity
to really take a break.

224
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:52,488
Look into Seocho-dong offices
when you have time.

225
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:54,615
Why? No one will want to hire her.

226
00:17:54,698 --> 00:17:56,784
Goodness. I'm just too honest.

227
00:17:56,867 --> 00:17:58,827
But no hard feelings, right?

228
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:00,662
Of course.

229
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:04,249
By the way, you two are always together.
Are you dating?

230
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:06,710
I didn't become a judge
to hear such nonsense!

231
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:09,004
What's wrong with me?

232
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:13,133
My mother thinks
I look like DiCaprio in Titanic.

233
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:15,302
How insulting to DiCaprio.

234
00:18:15,385 --> 00:18:16,637
Do you want to be sued?

235
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,430
What would I be sued for?

236
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:19,848
Defamation?

237
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:28,315
So, in sum,

238
00:18:28,398 --> 00:18:30,651
Anyone who saw the killer was murdered.

239
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:34,530
Except for one 10-year-old child.

240
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:39,368
"And from each victim,
he dismembered different body parts."

241
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:41,120
Wait.

242
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:44,790
He dismembered different body parts

243
00:18:44,873 --> 00:18:48,043
- of each victim. Then...
- Then what?

244
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:52,297
Satan.

245
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:55,884
Why are we realizing
this crucial thing now?

246
00:18:57,261 --> 00:18:59,012
Satan? What do you mean?

247
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:00,430
Do you remember that story

248
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:02,516
- about Satan escaping Hell?
- Yes.

249
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:07,104
Satan, the second-in-command
of Hell, rose in revolt 26 years ago.

250
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:11,233
And he stole the Kylum, Lucifer's
treasure, and fled to Earth.

251
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:16,029
Since then, Satan and the Kylum
have disappeared.

252
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:20,284
I'm sure he's hiding in
someone's body now.

253
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:23,579
But what does that have to do with J?

254
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:26,165
What she means is, in the human world,

255
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:28,333
even Satan must live in a human body.

256
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:30,669
But humans age and die.

257
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:32,629
And Satan would die with it.

258
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:36,175
But there is a way he can live forever.

259
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:37,384
He only needs two things.

260
00:19:37,467 --> 00:19:39,970
Different body parts
of good people.

261
00:19:40,053 --> 00:19:41,138
And the Kylum.

262
00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:43,390
I appreciate the detailed explanation,

263
00:19:44,224 --> 00:19:45,934
but I can't really wrap my head around it.

264
00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:48,937
To put it simply, Satan may have

265
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:51,690
entered the body of serial killer J

266
00:19:51,773 --> 00:19:54,318
and committed the murders.

267
00:19:54,401 --> 00:19:55,569
Ah.

268
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,572
Let's meet the victims' families first.

269
00:19:58,655 --> 00:20:00,782
Let's see if they forgave the criminal.

270
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:03,452
It's not too late
to find out if he's Satan after that.

271
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:05,370
It's unlikely,

272
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:08,540
but if there is any of them
who's forgiven him, what then?

273
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:11,168
Do you think you can forgive?

274
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:15,422
I guess I asked a silly question.

275
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:21,428
That's taking a while to heal.

276
00:20:22,971 --> 00:20:24,264
It'll heal soon.

277
00:20:26,808 --> 00:20:30,062
Do we know where Kang Bitna was
right before the attack last December?

278
00:20:30,145 --> 00:20:34,441
Yes. She left the court
at around 8 p.m. and got in a taxi.

279
00:20:34,524 --> 00:20:38,278
In half an hour, she got off near
the park where the incident occurred.

280
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:42,449
Then she was stabbed. But there were
no witnesses or security footage?

281
00:20:42,532 --> 00:20:44,409
Is there a chance that the attack

282
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:46,995
was somehow connected
with Jeong Jaegeol's family?

283
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:51,124
We can't rule it out. The last person
she contacted was Jeong Taegyu.

284
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:56,630
There's a reporter
who frequently writes about Judge Kang.

285
00:20:56,713 --> 00:20:57,923
What if we meet with them?

286
00:20:58,006 --> 00:21:00,676
- Right. Make an appointment.
- Okay.

287
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:03,553
REPORTER JO ARAN

288
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:05,514
Why are you working so hard now?

289
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:08,392
And you don't use your headphones anymore.

290
00:21:10,018 --> 00:21:13,855
I want to become a great detective.

291
00:21:14,564 --> 00:21:15,649
Punk.

292
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:27,119
- Did you find anything?
- Nothing yet.

293
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:31,665
I heard the restaurant by
Haeseo River where Bae was found called.

294
00:21:31,748 --> 00:21:34,751
- Anything on the security footage?
- No, nothing.

295
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:37,379
Keep digging
until you get something.

296
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:39,089
- Yes.
- Yes, sir.

297
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:59,568
The night Judge Kang was caught
going towards Haeseo River,

298
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:01,778
Bae Jayeong was killed.

299
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:03,697
This is very suspicious.

300
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,701
What are you doing?

301
00:22:14,249 --> 00:22:17,586
It works.

302
00:22:21,715 --> 00:22:24,217
I've always been curious.

303
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:26,803
About how evil humans can become

304
00:22:26,887 --> 00:22:28,930
to get what they want.

305
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:32,642
Do you want me to show you?

306
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:35,103
This makes me even more curious.

307
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:39,649
I wonder what you'd be willing to do
to protect that woman.

308
00:22:40,984 --> 00:22:42,194
Stop messing around.

309
00:22:42,277 --> 00:22:44,404
Before I kill you.

310
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:51,536
A death threat from a detective.

311
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:09,179
I didn't upload this security footage
anywhere else.

312
00:23:09,262 --> 00:23:12,557
It's only here.

313
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:14,059
For 10 points,

314
00:23:14,142 --> 00:23:17,562
how will you keep me quiet
and take this from me?

315
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:19,356
Go.

316
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:28,031
If you find the answer, call me.

317
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:52,431
Mr. Ha Yeongseok?

318
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:57,144
They didn't tell me the civil servant
in charge would be replaced.

319
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:01,523
I'm here because
I want to hear about your parents.

320
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:03,608
They passed away in 1998, correct?

321
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:07,237
Who the hell do you think you are
to ask after my parents

322
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,281
who were stabbed to death decades ago?

323
00:24:09,364 --> 00:24:12,117
I'm reinvestigating
the serial killings of J.

324
00:24:13,368 --> 00:24:15,620
Could I come in to speak with you?

325
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:17,873
About what?

326
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:21,168
About how much of a bastard I am
who found their bodies

327
00:24:21,251 --> 00:24:25,422
covered in maggots three days
after they were stabbed to death?

328
00:24:25,505 --> 00:24:27,591
I waited for the day that killer

329
00:24:28,675 --> 00:24:31,011
would be punished
for murdering my parents.

330
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:36,725
Or do you want to hear about how I became
an alcoholic after the statutes expired?

331
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:38,852
Hearing you makes me think

332
00:24:38,935 --> 00:24:43,273
you haven't forgiven him
for killing your parents.

333
00:24:43,356 --> 00:24:44,357
Forgive him?

334
00:24:45,275 --> 00:24:46,651
How dare you!

335
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:48,862
Do you think you could forgive?

336
00:24:49,446 --> 00:24:50,697
Get lost!

337
00:24:54,367 --> 00:24:55,535
REAL ESTATE AGENCY

338
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:58,997
That poor man.

339
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:01,750
They had three sweet daughters.

340
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:03,960
But their mother was sick.

341
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:07,589
So the husband went down
to another city to earn money.

342
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:09,090
That's when it happened.

343
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:11,051
Do you have his contact information?

344
00:25:11,134 --> 00:25:12,677
Or do you know where he moved?

345
00:25:13,261 --> 00:25:14,513
He's dead.

346
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:17,098
In May of 2014.

347
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:19,976
That's when
the statute of limitations expired

348
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:22,687
for the killer who did that to his family.

349
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:24,773
He wrote on his prescription bag

350
00:25:24,856 --> 00:25:28,735
that he could not forgive the killer,
but he had no hope left to go on.

351
00:25:31,071 --> 00:25:32,531
Then he didn't forgive...

352
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:33,949
Of course I can't.

353
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:35,534
But...

354
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:39,621
hasn't the state already forgiven him?

355
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:42,499
When we heard
the statute of limitations expired,

356
00:25:43,166 --> 00:25:46,378
we hugged each other
and cried for a long time.

357
00:25:46,461 --> 00:25:49,464
Saying the state deemed it was over,
so we should forget...

358
00:25:51,091 --> 00:25:52,425
and live our lives.

359
00:25:52,509 --> 00:25:56,388
I'm sorry to tell you this
when you're trying to reinvestigate,

360
00:25:57,055 --> 00:26:00,308
but I don't have any hope
that he'll be caught.

361
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:02,936
But thank you very much

362
00:26:03,019 --> 00:26:05,814
for not forgetting
our daughter and mother, and us.

363
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:08,608
For still remembering.

364
00:26:16,783 --> 00:26:19,828
Makes me angry the more I think about it.

365
00:26:24,499 --> 00:26:25,834
Have a drink.

366
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:38,179
Gosh, that burns.

367
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:41,266
Why abolish the statute of limitations?
Why not finish it?

368
00:26:41,349 --> 00:26:43,560
Are killings before August 1, 2000
not crimes?

369
00:26:43,643 --> 00:26:45,061
Damn it.

370
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:49,691
Why aren't you drinking cola today?

371
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:54,821
I saw on TV that when someone's sad,
they drink alcohol at places like this.

372
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:56,698
So...

373
00:26:57,365 --> 00:26:59,868
Applying ointment on me,
did you see it on TV, too?

374
00:26:59,951 --> 00:27:03,288
Yes. They do that a lot on TV.

375
00:27:03,371 --> 00:27:07,334
You said, "We can't be doing this."
Did you get that from a TV show too?

376
00:27:07,917 --> 00:27:10,170
No. That's from me.

377
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:12,464
Stop teasing me.

378
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:15,300
Thank you.

379
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:17,927
For being sad and upset...

380
00:27:20,013 --> 00:27:21,306
along with me.

381
00:27:22,015 --> 00:27:23,975
That's already a great comfort to me.

382
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:36,321
I have information
on the deceased Detective Kim.

383
00:27:36,404 --> 00:27:38,615
I will tell you in person.

384
00:27:49,876 --> 00:27:54,172
CONGRATULATIONS
ON THE REDEVELOPMENT PROJECT

385
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:57,258
SERGEANT CLEANING

386
00:27:58,093 --> 00:28:01,638
Goodness.

387
00:28:01,721 --> 00:28:03,223
- Give it.
- Yes.

388
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:07,977
It was nice to be back home for a bit.

389
00:28:08,061 --> 00:28:09,270
I didn't ask.

390
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:10,605
We should get going.

391
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:12,357
Good work. You can go.

392
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:17,737
Gosh. I can't even walk.

393
00:28:18,071 --> 00:28:19,823
Such a crybaby.

394
00:28:34,754 --> 00:28:38,675
Who is this person I have to meet?
Why are we at a place like...

395
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:05,618
I don't think there's anyone here.

396
00:29:05,702 --> 00:29:07,078
Sorry we're late, Paimon.

397
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:08,163
Paimon?

398
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:24,846
Paimon?

399
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:27,640
I heard you've done a great deed.

400
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:28,725
Me?

401
00:29:28,808 --> 00:29:30,477
No, I don't think so.

402
00:29:31,644 --> 00:29:33,480
Whatever I say,

403
00:29:34,647 --> 00:29:36,733
just reply "yes."

404
00:29:36,816 --> 00:29:37,942
Yes.

405
00:29:42,822 --> 00:29:45,617
I'll be giving you an important task soon.

406
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:48,244
If you fail or betray me,

407
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:52,081
what you're imagining right now,
it will happen to you.

408
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:53,166
Yes.

409
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,293
When will you kill Han Daon?

410
00:29:55,376 --> 00:29:58,087
You saw for yourself.
Why aren't you killing him?

411
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:04,093
Be patient. I'm preparing something
very interesting.

412
00:30:07,764 --> 00:30:10,683
No matter what happens,
Justitia can't get hurt.

413
00:30:12,727 --> 00:30:13,937
Only Han Daon.

414
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:16,189
You are to kill only Han Daon.

415
00:30:24,113 --> 00:30:26,783
We must kill anyone
who gets in our way.

416
00:30:26,866 --> 00:30:28,660
Find out if what she says is true.

417
00:30:28,743 --> 00:30:32,121
Then kill the human named Han Daon
and send him to Hell.

418
00:30:32,205 --> 00:30:33,623
If he's not a sinner,

419
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:36,084
I cannot kill him.

420
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:37,377
Then make him...

421
00:30:39,712 --> 00:30:41,047
a sinner.

422
00:30:42,215 --> 00:30:44,717
And Justitia...

423
00:30:44,801 --> 00:30:45,844
You can kill her.

424
00:30:48,137 --> 00:30:50,890
That is if you, Paimon,

425
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:53,935
can beat her.

426
00:31:01,734 --> 00:31:04,737
I will make sure
it was worth summoning Bael.

427
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:07,198
Don't worry.

428
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:31,347
Move. I'm late for work.

429
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,853
Why is Paimon here?

430
00:31:36,936 --> 00:31:38,646
I just reported to Bael.

431
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:41,190
Paimon wasn't in my plan.

432
00:31:41,274 --> 00:31:44,527
If you order a burger,
of course it comes with fries.

433
00:31:44,611 --> 00:31:47,530
Don't you know the history
between Paimon and Justitia?

434
00:31:47,614 --> 00:31:49,616
They've been enemies for 400 years.

435
00:31:49,699 --> 00:31:51,951
They're rivals,
both eyeing to succeed Bael.

436
00:31:52,035 --> 00:31:53,244
I know that.

437
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:56,789
So I'm regretting it.
But what's the use now?

438
00:31:59,375 --> 00:32:01,502
Nothing will happen to Justitia.

439
00:32:02,462 --> 00:32:04,964
He promised to leave
after killing just Han Daon.

440
00:32:05,048 --> 00:32:06,841
How can you believe a demon's promise?

441
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:11,054
Why did you have to report this
and make it come to be such a mess?

442
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,767
Because he ruined Justitia.

443
00:32:16,434 --> 00:32:17,894
Such a noble demon.

444
00:32:18,978 --> 00:32:21,564
He corrupted her,
turning her into a dirty human.

445
00:32:23,316 --> 00:32:24,943
This is all because of Han Daon.

446
00:32:25,693 --> 00:32:27,070
We just need him to die.

447
00:32:27,153 --> 00:32:29,322
This is betrayal.

448
00:32:30,198 --> 00:32:32,075
I'm going to tell Justitia.

449
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:35,411
Then I will tell her
that you go to church.

450
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:39,165
And I will also tell Bael that...

451
00:32:40,583 --> 00:32:42,251
you're a Jesus-believing traitor.

452
00:32:44,253 --> 00:32:46,965
What I'm doing now

453
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:51,803
is not betrayal, it's loyalty.
I've risked my life for the one I serve.

454
00:32:51,886 --> 00:32:54,055
If you want it your way,

455
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:56,808
stake your life on it first.

456
00:33:19,914 --> 00:33:22,125
You're here. Please have a seat.

457
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,714
Congratulations on your pregnancy.

458
00:33:28,423 --> 00:33:30,049
When are you due?

459
00:33:30,633 --> 00:33:34,846
I know my mother
turned it down again.

460
00:33:34,929 --> 00:33:39,017
It's her choice whether to sell that villa
to your company.

461
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:42,729
So please stop pestering me
to persuade her.

462
00:33:42,812 --> 00:33:45,023
With the compensation we can provide,

463
00:33:45,106 --> 00:33:48,735
your child in your belly
will lack nothing when they're born.

464
00:33:48,818 --> 00:33:52,030
We can raise our child
with the money my husband and I earn.

465
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:54,615
And I'm not interested
in my mother's money.

466
00:33:55,992 --> 00:33:57,243
Please don't call me again.

467
00:33:58,911 --> 00:34:02,123
Do you know there's been
a murder in that neighborhood recently?

468
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:07,462
Isn't it dangerous to leave your mother
in that neighborhood alone?

469
00:34:09,922 --> 00:34:11,591
NO TO REDEVELOPMENT OF HWANGCHEON-DONG!

470
00:34:11,674 --> 00:34:13,968
My daughter's coming today,

471
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:16,304
and I made some extra for you, too.

472
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:18,222
You didn't need to make all this for us.

473
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:19,515
You're family.

474
00:34:20,516 --> 00:34:22,477
Are you excited to see your daughter?

475
00:34:23,186 --> 00:34:26,773
Yes. I haven't seen her in so long.

476
00:34:34,197 --> 00:34:36,616
Jueun. Come in.

477
00:34:46,042 --> 00:34:47,376
- I should get going.
- Okay.

478
00:34:47,877 --> 00:34:49,462
- Bye, honey.
- Bye.

479
00:34:51,631 --> 00:34:53,341
- No need to see me out.
- It's okay.

480
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:54,926
Bye.

481
00:34:55,593 --> 00:34:58,012
Jueun, I made japchae.

482
00:34:58,096 --> 00:34:59,764
It's your favorite.

483
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:02,225
Sign here.

484
00:35:03,726 --> 00:35:04,769
What's this?

485
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:06,938
REDEVELOPMENT CONSENT FORM

486
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:09,398
The redevelopment consent form.

487
00:35:09,482 --> 00:35:12,276
If you sign and leave,
they'll give you a lot of money.

488
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:15,738
We can use half of it
to pay back my housing loan.

489
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:17,782
And you can move in with us.

490
00:35:18,866 --> 00:35:19,867
Well...

491
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:23,913
But I have to stay here.

492
00:35:25,498 --> 00:35:27,166
- I have to meet someone.
- Who?

493
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:30,211
Do you think Yechan
is going to come see you as a ghost?

494
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:33,005
No, it's not like that.

495
00:35:33,089 --> 00:35:34,841
How can a Christian believe in ghosts?

496
00:35:35,716 --> 00:35:37,260
Listen to me and sign!

497
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:40,179
Can't you be a mom to me just once?

498
00:35:40,263 --> 00:35:44,308
Stop it. If you shout,
it's not good for the baby.

499
00:35:45,601 --> 00:35:49,272
Don't pretend to be worried about me.
You don't care about me.

500
00:35:49,939 --> 00:35:52,525
You only ever cared
about Yechan and church.

501
00:35:52,608 --> 00:35:54,235
Even now.

502
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:56,362
No, it's not like that.

503
00:35:59,323 --> 00:36:00,491
I'm sorry.

504
00:36:02,076 --> 00:36:03,161
I'm sorry.

505
00:36:04,453 --> 00:36:05,621
I'm tired of this.

506
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:11,127
I'm tired of you apologizing.

507
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:12,295
Wait.

508
00:36:12,879 --> 00:36:15,047
Jueun.

509
00:36:15,131 --> 00:36:16,132
Jueun.

510
00:36:21,554 --> 00:36:22,597
I'm sorry.

511
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:36,152
Be careful.

512
00:36:36,903 --> 00:36:38,154
You almost hurt me.

513
00:36:38,237 --> 00:36:39,822
I'm so sorry.

514
00:36:41,282 --> 00:36:42,366
Thank you.

515
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:58,216
Jueun.

516
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:07,808
It's you.

517
00:37:09,602 --> 00:37:12,480
Are you Jeong Yechan's mother?

518
00:37:44,887 --> 00:37:46,722
JEONG YECHAN

519
00:37:46,806 --> 00:37:50,184
CERTIFICATE OF AWARD
JEONG YECHAN

520
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:26,762
Yechan, I'm leaving!

521
00:38:27,513 --> 00:38:29,140
Hurry up!

522
00:38:29,223 --> 00:38:30,266
Coming!

523
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:34,645
Can you wake Jueun up?
She can't be late on the first day.

524
00:38:35,354 --> 00:38:37,982
Get some bread with Jueun
on the way to school.

525
00:38:38,065 --> 00:38:41,193
There's food in the fridge.
Make sure your sister eats dinner.

526
00:38:41,277 --> 00:38:42,528
Okay.

527
00:38:42,611 --> 00:38:44,030
- Mom.
- Yeah?

528
00:38:44,613 --> 00:38:46,365
Let's talk later tonight.

529
00:38:56,292 --> 00:38:57,793
More kimchi, please!

530
00:38:57,877 --> 00:38:59,003
Coming!

531
00:38:59,086 --> 00:39:00,504
More soup over here.

532
00:39:00,588 --> 00:39:02,340
- Can we have more anchovies?
- Anchovies.

533
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:04,216
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

534
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:05,718
Wait a moment.

535
00:39:05,801 --> 00:39:07,428
Gosh, I haven't seen you in a while.

536
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:09,972
I heard you bought a villa recently.

537
00:39:10,056 --> 00:39:11,057
Well...

538
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:13,893
You're a building owner now.
Don't work so hard.

539
00:39:13,976 --> 00:39:16,979
Gosh. I have to send
both my kids to college.

540
00:39:17,063 --> 00:39:18,606
I still have a long way to go.

541
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:19,774
Come on.

542
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:21,025
Enjoy.

543
00:39:21,108 --> 00:39:22,526
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

544
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:24,362
Hello?

545
00:39:24,945 --> 00:39:27,073
Yes, I'm Yechan's mother.

546
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:31,577
LATE JEONG YECHAN

547
00:39:33,913 --> 00:39:36,832
♪ All unworthy though I be ♪

548
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:44,256
♪ There is welcome there for me ♪

549
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:50,888
♪ For the King is our own Jesus ♪

550
00:39:50,971 --> 00:39:57,937
♪ Lord and Savior of His own ♪

551
00:40:06,862 --> 00:40:09,365
Myeongsuk, don't be so sad.

552
00:40:09,448 --> 00:40:14,036
God must have called upon Yechan because
there aren't enough angels in Heaven.

553
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,497
If it's because
there aren't enough angels,

554
00:40:18,332 --> 00:40:21,377
then your son should die now
and go to Heaven, too.

555
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:22,837
How could you...

556
00:40:26,632 --> 00:40:27,675
Pastor.

557
00:40:29,009 --> 00:40:32,346
Pastor... I have a question, Pastor.

558
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:33,597
Pastor.

559
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:36,725
Pastor!

560
00:40:36,809 --> 00:40:39,812
Did I not give enough offerings?

561
00:40:39,895 --> 00:40:44,275
Why did the Lord take my Yechan?

562
00:40:44,358 --> 00:40:48,070
It's all part of His big plan...

563
00:40:48,154 --> 00:40:49,488
What plan?

564
00:40:49,572 --> 00:40:50,948
Oh, Lord...

565
00:40:51,031 --> 00:40:52,116
My son...

566
00:40:54,618 --> 00:40:59,582
He believed in God from the moment
he was conceived in my belly.

567
00:41:00,249 --> 00:41:03,127
But where was God
when my Yechan was dying?

568
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:04,462
Where was He?

569
00:41:04,545 --> 00:41:06,297
Why him?

570
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:10,009
My sweet baby!

571
00:41:10,885 --> 00:41:13,429
Why did he have to die so brutally?

572
00:41:13,929 --> 00:41:17,391
What is this big plan?

573
00:41:17,975 --> 00:41:21,770
Why did He have to take a son
from a single mother?

574
00:41:29,862 --> 00:41:33,032
- I don't need this!
- Myeongsuk!

575
00:41:33,115 --> 00:41:35,242
- My goodness.
- I don't need this anymore!

576
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:36,619
- Myeongsuk!
- Go! Leave!

577
00:41:36,702 --> 00:41:37,912
Get out!

578
00:41:37,995 --> 00:41:41,999
Myeongsuk!

579
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:11,862
Did you go to the academy?

580
00:42:16,617 --> 00:42:17,993
What are you wearing?

581
00:42:18,077 --> 00:42:20,037
Did they tell you to wear uniforms now?

582
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:22,540
Mom, I'm in middle school now.

583
00:42:23,165 --> 00:42:24,166
I'm in eighth grade.

584
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:25,876
What are you talking about?

585
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:29,380
Your brother's in middle school,
and you're in fifth grade.

586
00:42:32,591 --> 00:42:35,052
Mom!

587
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:17,344
Lord...

588
00:43:21,432 --> 00:43:24,518
Please hear my prayer.

589
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:28,355
I will always be your servant.

590
00:43:30,566 --> 00:43:33,027
Please answer my one prayer.

591
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:34,862
Please.

592
00:43:35,946 --> 00:43:38,907
I've been going to church every day
since that day.

593
00:43:39,491 --> 00:43:41,327
I don't know
what you prayed for,

594
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:44,413
but it hasn't been answered
for 20 years. That's...

595
00:43:46,874 --> 00:43:48,584
Isn't this negligence?

596
00:43:48,667 --> 00:43:49,668
Damn it.

597
00:43:51,211 --> 00:43:54,006
I saw on the news. He's back.

598
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:59,178
I've waited here for 25 years to meet him.

599
00:44:00,429 --> 00:44:01,639
I have to meet him.

600
00:44:01,722 --> 00:44:04,308
Are you not leaving this villa because...

601
00:44:05,976 --> 00:44:07,603
I'm waiting for him.

602
00:44:07,686 --> 00:44:08,896
What for?

603
00:44:09,938 --> 00:44:13,275
Isn't it better for trash like him
to die quietly and alone?

604
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:14,360
No.

605
00:44:15,277 --> 00:44:17,446
He can't die without me knowing.

606
00:44:17,529 --> 00:44:21,075
I have to meet him.
I have a question for him.

607
00:44:21,867 --> 00:44:26,997
Only then will I get the closure I need.

608
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:40,135
Are you okay?
You don't look so good since earlier.

609
00:44:40,719 --> 00:44:42,680
I should be asking if you're okay.

610
00:44:42,763 --> 00:44:45,391
The most important place is left.

611
00:45:07,871 --> 00:45:09,373
YEONJU-RO

612
00:45:31,895 --> 00:45:34,106
It was just a regular morning.

613
00:45:36,316 --> 00:45:38,193
A day like any other.

614
00:45:38,944 --> 00:45:41,280
It felt like tomorrow
and the day after that...

615
00:45:42,865 --> 00:45:44,533
would always be the same.

616
00:45:45,492 --> 00:45:48,829
We didn't know
how happy our ordinary days were.

617
00:46:09,725 --> 00:46:10,851
Mom.

618
00:46:24,031 --> 00:46:26,825
Daon, run away!

619
00:46:27,451 --> 00:46:28,452
Hurry!

620
00:46:33,832 --> 00:46:36,710
Don't open the door.

621
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:39,463
Don't.

622
00:46:50,432 --> 00:46:56,814
Please protect my son, Daon.

623
00:47:18,919 --> 00:47:20,629
- Are you okay?
- I'm not.

624
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:24,174
Why aren't you crying? Aren't you sad?

625
00:47:24,925 --> 00:47:26,927
How can you be so calm?

626
00:47:28,428 --> 00:47:32,391
If I cry, I'm scared I'll revert back
to being the coward that I was.

627
00:47:35,727 --> 00:47:37,521
You're so annoying, Han Daon.

628
00:47:38,564 --> 00:47:40,899
You're the worst.

629
00:47:43,902 --> 00:47:44,945
I looked.

630
00:47:45,445 --> 00:47:48,115
Your family and Detective Kim

631
00:47:48,824 --> 00:47:49,908
aren't in Hell.

632
00:47:51,076 --> 00:47:52,202
They're all in Heaven.

633
00:47:54,746 --> 00:47:56,331
Then I'll never see them again.

634
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:57,624
Because I'm going to Hell.

635
00:47:57,708 --> 00:47:59,543
No, you're not going to Hell.

636
00:48:00,586 --> 00:48:02,462
Now that I've heard all your stories...

637
00:48:05,173 --> 00:48:07,301
I will find him and kill him.

638
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:37,748
Will you really be fine going alone?

639
00:48:37,831 --> 00:48:39,541
Don't act like you're worried.

640
00:48:40,459 --> 00:48:41,960
I'm sorry.

641
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:45,464
Don't be weird. Go.

642
00:48:50,427 --> 00:48:51,595
I'm really sorry.

643
00:49:01,438 --> 00:49:05,025
Hey, I'm glad you're here.

644
00:49:05,108 --> 00:49:07,361
The customer service is terrible. This...

645
00:49:08,695 --> 00:49:10,864
- Sit up straight.
- What the...

646
00:49:11,448 --> 00:49:13,909
You can't talk to me like that.

647
00:49:16,787 --> 00:49:18,205
Did that sober you up?

648
00:49:21,458 --> 00:49:22,709
Look who it is.

649
00:49:22,793 --> 00:49:25,045
It's the judge.

650
00:49:25,128 --> 00:49:26,129
Satan.

651
00:49:26,213 --> 00:49:27,631
What... What?

652
00:49:27,714 --> 00:49:30,842
You escaped from Hell 26 years ago
and possessed a human body.

653
00:49:31,677 --> 00:49:35,389
Now, you're serial killer J.
The demon of all demons.

654
00:49:35,472 --> 00:49:38,809
Gosh, this is crazy.
A judge shows up out of nowhere

655
00:49:38,892 --> 00:49:40,727
and talks shit. What are you...

656
00:49:41,353 --> 00:49:42,646
Be honest.

657
00:49:43,605 --> 00:49:44,648
You're Satan, right?

658
00:49:45,857 --> 00:49:47,192
You're J, aren't you?

659
00:49:47,943 --> 00:49:50,195
I don't know what you're saying.

660
00:49:51,488 --> 00:49:53,156
What the...

661
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:56,201
I thought I'd softened a bit recently,
but no.

662
00:49:56,827 --> 00:49:59,413
Stop testing my patience
and tell me the truth.

663
00:49:59,496 --> 00:50:00,747
What are you?

664
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:02,290
I don't know anything.

665
00:50:02,374 --> 00:50:06,461
I swear on my mother who's in Heaven.

666
00:50:06,545 --> 00:50:09,506
I don't know what Satan is or who J is.

667
00:50:09,589 --> 00:50:11,174
I don't know anything.

668
00:50:11,258 --> 00:50:13,635
How am I supposed
to believe a bastard like you?

669
00:50:13,719 --> 00:50:16,221
Then keep thinking I'm Satan and kill me!

670
00:50:16,304 --> 00:50:19,016
My life's ruined already anyways.

671
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:41,747
Do I need to feed you?

672
00:50:42,247 --> 00:50:43,290
Ah.

673
00:50:44,041 --> 00:50:45,667
Ah.

674
00:50:48,295 --> 00:50:49,796
What's with the face?

675
00:50:50,422 --> 00:50:52,883
Has a pretty girl never nursed you before?

676
00:50:54,176 --> 00:50:56,178
You're so annoying, Han Daon.

677
00:50:57,179 --> 00:50:58,597
You're the worst.

678
00:51:09,524 --> 00:51:11,401
This makes me even more curious.

679
00:51:12,194 --> 00:51:15,989
I wonder what you'd be willing to do
to protect that woman.

680
00:51:37,427 --> 00:51:40,764
Detective Jang, I found the answer.
Let's meet now.

681
00:51:44,476 --> 00:51:45,477
JUDGE KANG BITNA

682
00:51:48,688 --> 00:51:49,815
You're calling late.

683
00:51:49,898 --> 00:51:51,024
Help me.

684
00:51:51,108 --> 00:51:52,275
Judge Kang, where are you?

685
00:51:52,359 --> 00:51:54,069
I'll text you the location.

686
00:51:54,653 --> 00:51:56,988
Don't call the police and come alone.

687
00:51:57,948 --> 00:51:59,074
Come quickly!

688
00:52:15,132 --> 00:52:18,844
The phone you called
is turned off. After the beep...

689
00:52:35,652 --> 00:52:37,195
Pastor, I'm...

690
00:52:38,822 --> 00:52:41,616
I'm a liar, thief, and traitor.

691
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:45,287
I wonder what's the use in being forgiven.

692
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:47,998
I just realized today.

693
00:52:48,790 --> 00:52:50,417
That this is the real me.

694
00:52:53,378 --> 00:52:55,088
I'll just confidently go to Hell.

695
00:52:55,672 --> 00:52:57,465
Thank you for everything, Pastor.

696
00:53:04,222 --> 00:53:05,223
Mando.

697
00:53:07,058 --> 00:53:10,061
The door to our church
is always wide open.

698
00:53:11,354 --> 00:53:12,814
Just close it.

699
00:53:13,648 --> 00:53:16,109
An evil demon might come in.

700
00:53:21,239 --> 00:53:24,034
Did you ask for forgiveness
for stealing a cell phone?

701
00:53:27,537 --> 00:53:29,706
- I'm not going to church anymore.
- Why not?

702
00:53:30,290 --> 00:53:32,250
Did they kick you out
for not donating enough?

703
00:53:32,334 --> 00:53:36,922
Stop. Our pastor's not like that.

704
00:53:38,673 --> 00:53:39,674
"Our pastor"?

705
00:53:40,675 --> 00:53:44,346
I bet even your pastor is vulnerable
when it comes to money.

706
00:53:44,429 --> 00:53:46,723
- I said stop.
- Are you crazy?

707
00:53:47,474 --> 00:53:50,352
Do you want to die?
Do you think God's on your side now?

708
00:53:50,435 --> 00:53:51,728
Is that why you're acting out?

709
00:53:51,811 --> 00:53:54,439
No. God isn't on my side.

710
00:53:55,315 --> 00:53:57,567
But going to church

711
00:53:57,651 --> 00:53:59,694
made me realize one thing for sure.

712
00:53:59,778 --> 00:54:02,572
What's that, Brother Mando?

713
00:54:08,245 --> 00:54:09,371
That I'm a demon, too.

714
00:54:10,830 --> 00:54:13,416
You son of a bitch!

715
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:16,044
Damn it! I'm going to kill you!

716
00:54:18,672 --> 00:54:22,592
Not now though.

717
00:54:24,844 --> 00:54:27,639
My gosh!
I thought I was having a heart attack!

718
00:54:28,598 --> 00:54:31,726
Two hours! I have two hours left
to save him! Two hours!

719
00:54:34,938 --> 00:54:35,981
Justitia!

720
00:54:36,898 --> 00:54:38,024
Justitia!

721
00:54:38,108 --> 00:54:40,402
Justitia? She's not here.

722
00:54:41,069 --> 00:54:42,862
Oh, no. What do I do?

723
00:54:43,738 --> 00:54:46,533
Detective!

724
00:54:46,616 --> 00:54:49,119
He probably left. Of course he's not here.

725
00:54:49,202 --> 00:54:50,328
I'm a fool!

726
00:54:50,412 --> 00:54:52,372
What's all this noise this late?

727
00:55:03,925 --> 00:55:06,261
Let go. Damn it!

728
00:55:06,344 --> 00:55:08,138
Are you crazy?

729
00:55:21,401 --> 00:55:22,444
You...

730
00:55:24,279 --> 00:55:25,280
Justitia.

731
00:55:29,993 --> 00:55:32,746
It was obvious
we weren't going to be let in.

732
00:55:32,829 --> 00:55:35,623
By the way, Justitia, I was so surprised.

733
00:55:35,707 --> 00:55:39,377
She suddenly spread out
her white wings and...

734
00:55:39,461 --> 00:55:42,339
And I was like,
"Oh, my God, you were an angel?"

735
00:55:42,422 --> 00:55:43,923
He's a demon.

736
00:55:44,007 --> 00:55:46,301
You're working with a demon.

737
00:55:46,384 --> 00:55:47,385
I only

738
00:55:48,261 --> 00:55:51,222
help the good and poor.

739
00:55:55,769 --> 00:55:58,730
I've done my part. I'm leaving.

740
00:56:04,861 --> 00:56:07,280
She only says her piece. So rude.

741
00:56:08,365 --> 00:56:09,491
What the...

742
00:56:13,411 --> 00:56:14,496
I'm sorry, Justitia.

743
00:56:14,579 --> 00:56:16,247
What happened?

744
00:56:16,331 --> 00:56:18,375
I'm a traitor.

745
00:56:18,458 --> 00:56:20,585
I know. You're going to church.

746
00:56:21,211 --> 00:56:22,545
How did you...

747
00:56:22,629 --> 00:56:25,006
I heard your prayers.
How could I not know?

748
00:56:25,090 --> 00:56:26,508
If you knew, then why...

749
00:56:27,634 --> 00:56:29,969
I was curious
how far your treachery would go.

750
00:56:30,053 --> 00:56:33,431
The end is a bit disappointing.
But this was a great betrayal.

751
00:56:33,515 --> 00:56:37,685
Remember that betrayal and lying
are prerequisites for being a demon.

752
00:56:37,769 --> 00:56:38,853
So keep it up.

753
00:56:39,437 --> 00:56:41,231
Good job, get up.

754
00:56:41,856 --> 00:56:44,234
Oh, right. Listen, Justitia.

755
00:56:44,317 --> 00:56:46,528
- There's one more thing.
- What?

756
00:56:48,363 --> 00:56:52,033
Detective Han is in danger right now.

757
00:56:52,117 --> 00:56:53,827
You need to hurry and change your clothes.

758
00:57:08,258 --> 00:57:09,259
Kang Bitna.

759
00:57:09,342 --> 00:57:11,761
Judge Kang!

760
00:57:13,596 --> 00:57:15,140
Looking for Kang Bitna?

761
00:57:18,935 --> 00:57:21,729
How are you here?

762
00:57:23,606 --> 00:57:24,983
What are you doing?

763
00:57:25,066 --> 00:57:26,651
Where's Judge Kang?

764
00:57:33,074 --> 00:57:35,076
I killed her.

765
00:57:38,955 --> 00:57:40,457
That's a lie.

766
00:57:41,249 --> 00:57:44,043
Right. How did I kill a demon?

767
00:57:44,127 --> 00:57:47,005
A demon can kill another demon.

768
00:57:50,341 --> 00:57:51,384
Wow.

769
00:57:52,510 --> 00:57:55,180
Are you going to kill me
and go to Hell to see her?

770
00:57:55,263 --> 00:57:56,723
You really liked her, didn't you?

771
00:57:56,806 --> 00:58:00,518
Die, asshole!

772
00:58:03,646 --> 00:58:06,399
Die!

773
00:58:10,862 --> 00:58:11,905
Die!

774
00:58:17,202 --> 00:58:18,536
That's enough.

775
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:28,940
You can't beat Kang Bitna anyway.

776
00:59:50,378 --> 00:59:51,421
Han Daon.

777
00:59:51,504 --> 00:59:53,965
Are you okay? You're still alive, right?

778
00:59:54,549 --> 00:59:56,175
Worry about yourself!

779
01:00:02,181 --> 01:00:03,891
Stay put.

780
01:00:07,812 --> 01:00:08,980
Kang Bitna.

781
01:00:39,927 --> 01:00:42,430
You haven't changed in 400 years.

782
01:00:46,434 --> 01:00:47,727
Of course not.

783
01:00:49,979 --> 01:00:54,901
Because I've endured the past 400 years
trying to come up with ways...

784
01:00:57,612 --> 01:01:00,531
to make you feel the exact pain I felt.

785
01:01:05,411 --> 01:01:06,871
Han Daon is innocent.

786
01:01:06,954 --> 01:01:08,623
You're right. He is.

787
01:01:08,706 --> 01:01:10,083
That's why I'm killing him.

788
01:01:11,167 --> 01:01:15,421
I want you to see
an innocent person you love

789
01:01:15,505 --> 01:01:17,674
die in front of you.

790
01:02:17,984 --> 01:02:21,571
Be lost in nightmares.

791
01:02:57,023 --> 01:02:58,566
Stop messing around.

792
01:02:58,649 --> 01:03:00,151
I know you're not Han Daon.

793
01:03:01,444 --> 01:03:03,738
Judge Kang. You love me.

794
01:03:05,031 --> 01:03:06,324
Please die.

795
01:03:07,909 --> 01:03:09,035
I'm begging you.

796
01:03:21,672 --> 01:03:23,132
Die!

797
01:04:21,315 --> 01:04:22,316
Kang Bitna!

798
01:04:51,178 --> 01:04:53,306
I can finally pay you back.

799
01:04:53,389 --> 01:04:54,891
I won't go easy on you now.

800
01:05:40,561 --> 01:05:42,313
Han Daon.

801
01:05:42,396 --> 01:05:44,482
Han Daon!

802
01:05:46,192 --> 01:05:48,903
Gosh, that hurts.

803
01:05:53,240 --> 01:05:54,700
I told you not to come down!

804
01:06:11,342 --> 01:06:12,718
From now on,

805
01:06:14,595 --> 01:06:15,888
rely on and trust only me.

806
01:06:17,431 --> 01:06:19,225
I will protect you.

807
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:35,324
Let's go.

808
01:06:49,338 --> 01:06:50,381
No!

809
01:07:06,439 --> 01:07:11,193
THE JUDGE FROM HELL

810
01:07:11,277 --> 01:07:14,196
{\an8}SPECIAL THANKS TO ACTOR CHOI DAE-HOON

811
01:07:37,011 --> 01:07:38,679
{\an8}Han Daon is nothing.

812
01:07:40,056 --> 01:07:41,974
{\an8}Justitia will lose all her powers.

813
01:07:43,267 --> 01:07:46,353
{\an8}Father. Please let me marry your son.

814
01:07:46,437 --> 01:07:49,106
{\an8}Are you out of your mind?
You'll die.

815
01:07:49,231 --> 01:07:51,067
{\an8}Did you kill my son? Did you?

816
01:07:51,734 --> 01:07:52,985
{\an8}Let go! Let go.

817
01:07:55,196 --> 01:07:56,989
{\an8}What is this place?

818
01:08:03,454 --> 01:08:05,331
{\an8}Did your mother die here?

819
01:08:05,414 --> 01:08:06,916
{\an8}Tell me who killed her.

820
01:08:06,999 --> 01:08:09,502
{\an8}She's lost her powers and is vulnerable.

821
01:08:09,585 --> 01:08:11,170
{\an8}Die!

822
01:08:14,965 --> 01:08:17,718
{\an8}You should have just died then.

823
01:08:30,022 --> 01:08:32,024
