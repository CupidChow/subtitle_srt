00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:30,947
THE JUDGE FROM HELL

2
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:33,908
CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:00:33,992 --> 00:00:35,952
CHILD ACTORS AND ANIMALS
FILMED IN SAFE ENVIRONMENT

4
00:00:53,094 --> 00:00:54,512
{\an8}- What happened?
Hey.

5
00:00:55,013 --> 00:00:58,767
{\an8}If it's suicide, it's probably because
he kidnapped Kang. If it's murder...

6
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:02,562
{\an8}Who could it have been?

7
00:01:02,645 --> 00:01:05,940
{\an8}Someone who wanted Jeong Seonho to die.

8
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:08,359
{\an8}Stating the obvious, don't you think?

9
00:01:09,694 --> 00:01:13,156
The body is mutilated
beyond visual identification.

10
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,450
Let's wait for the autopsy results.

11
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:19,913
- We found this near the scene.
- Okay.

12
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:25,460
"My father and brother killed me."

13
00:01:36,137 --> 00:01:38,056
EPISODE 12

14
00:01:39,182 --> 00:01:40,308
I...

15
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:43,478
did not kill my brother.

16
00:01:43,561 --> 00:01:45,230
Then why would your brother

17
00:01:46,815 --> 00:01:48,650
leave a note like this?

18
00:01:48,733 --> 00:01:49,734
I'm curious, too.

19
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:52,112
The day your brother supposedly died,

20
00:01:52,695 --> 00:01:53,947
what were you doing?

21
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:55,156
I was home.

22
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,492
All security cameras
at your home were destroyed,

23
00:01:57,575 --> 00:01:59,452
so we can't verify who came and went.

24
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:02,831
On the day
Judge Kang was held captive at my house,

25
00:02:03,414 --> 00:02:05,333
they were destroyed in the morning.

26
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:07,502
My brother likely did it.

27
00:02:07,585 --> 00:02:10,088
Is that why you wanted
to kill your brother?

28
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:12,924
Because he kept causing trouble?

29
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:15,552
Why would I do that?

30
00:02:18,721 --> 00:02:20,723
It's not worth killing him myself.

31
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:23,685
I killed him.

32
00:02:23,768 --> 00:02:27,438
I raised him wrong
and set him on the wrong path.

33
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:30,942
No matter what anyone says,

34
00:02:32,443 --> 00:02:34,863
he was precious to me.

35
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:36,573
Was he so precious to you

36
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:41,161
that you had to hold his funeral
even before the DNA results came out?

37
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:44,747
He's already gone.

38
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:54,048
Will they fall for it?

39
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:55,216
Of course.

40
00:02:56,092 --> 00:02:57,427
Right, Justitia?

41
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:00,346
Oh, blue!

42
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,639
It's so pretty.

43
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:03,057
You're wrinkling them.

44
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:05,852
The day Judge Kang
was held captive,

45
00:03:05,935 --> 00:03:08,271
Jeong Taegyu met
with an assemblyman at a golf course.

46
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:12,650
The one preparing to propose legislation
on the redevelopment of Hwangcheon.

47
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:16,154
{\an8}<i>- Let's go.
- All right.</i>

48
00:03:16,237 --> 00:03:17,947
- Seems shady.
- Yes.

49
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:20,241
When do we get the DNA results?

50
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:21,618
In three days.

51
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:22,994
The burial day.

52
00:03:23,077 --> 00:03:25,121
There's something fishy going on here.

53
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:27,498
Why are you so quiet?

54
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:28,708
What's bothering you?

55
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:30,168
I just have things to think about.

56
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:34,756
We have time before the burial.
Let's wait for the DNA results.

57
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:36,633
Keep an eye on Jaegeol and Taegyu.

58
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:38,593
- Yes, sir.
- All right.

59
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:43,640
PHOTOS FROM THE SCENE
JEONG SEONHO

60
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:09,374
Must I express...

61
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:12,502
my condolences?

62
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:14,087
How dare you!

63
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:16,089
She's a guest.

64
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:19,550
Thank you for coming.

65
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:22,512
Congratulations.
The thorn in your side is gone.

66
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:23,846
Hey!

67
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:26,683
No need to pretend in front of me.

68
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:28,518
I know

69
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:30,186
you're not sad at all.

70
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,773
You're moving the body tomorrow?

71
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:36,359
Good luck.

72
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:40,947
What a bitch.

73
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:43,116
How amusing.

74
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:58,673
How could you?

75
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:05,555
Why did you have to go before me?

76
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:07,640
The body found in the car
is not Jeong Seonho's.

77
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:09,726
What? What do you mean?

78
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:11,436
The results from the NFS.

79
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:13,563
Then who was in the car?

80
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:18,026
The DNA matches a wanted fugitive
who disappeared ten years ago.

81
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:19,193
What?

82
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:21,529
That doesn't make sense.

83
00:05:21,612 --> 00:05:23,614
That means Jeong Seonho is alive.

84
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:29,620
Jeong Seonho was last seen
by a motel in Gangwon-do.

85
00:05:31,622 --> 00:05:34,709
He got into an unregistered car there
and vanished.

86
00:05:37,211 --> 00:05:39,130
- I'll go back to Gangwon-do.
- Okay.

87
00:05:39,213 --> 00:05:40,631
There's no need.

88
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:48,473
I'm...

89
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:50,933
turning myself in.

90
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:52,894
Seonho!

91
00:05:52,977 --> 00:05:54,228
Sir.

92
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:56,981
Seonho is apparently
at the police station.

93
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:04,072
- He's alive?
- Yes.

94
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:17,043
{\an8}4 DAYS AGO

00:06:17,126 --> 00:06:19,462
{\an8}VIP
PATIENT: KANG BITNA

96
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:22,673
- Hello.
- You're here.

97
00:06:22,757 --> 00:06:24,175
- Yes.
- Hello.

98
00:06:24,258 --> 00:06:25,259
Hey.

99
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,928
Where is she?

100
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:29,639
We heard she was being discharged
and came to help,

101
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:31,140
but she's not here.

102
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:42,151
<i>At 10 tonight at the caf√©
in front of the villa.</i>

103
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:49,617
Where were you? I was worried.

104
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,327
Sit down so we can talk.

105
00:06:56,457 --> 00:06:57,917
I was going to handle it myself,

106
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,087
but I thought it'd be better
to let you know in advance.

107
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:02,463
What is it?

108
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:04,632
Jeong Seonho is in Gangwon-do.

109
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:08,052
He has evidence of the J serial killings.

110
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,058
I'm from reception.

111
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:16,060
Can you open the door for a moment?

112
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:18,146
The police called.

113
00:07:30,074 --> 00:07:32,994
You should have just died then.

114
00:07:38,332 --> 00:07:41,961
We're going to use
Jeong Seonho to catch J.

115
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:50,636
I found it!

116
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:04,108
You got this, Justitia.

117
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:08,237
Hey.

118
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:09,989
I'm going to clean up a bit.

119
00:08:10,072 --> 00:08:11,073
Hurry up.

120
00:08:12,074 --> 00:08:13,075
Come on.

121
00:08:17,955 --> 00:08:19,832
Whose axe is that?

122
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:21,584
Why do you want to know?

123
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,214
Is it your brother's or father's?

124
00:08:27,798 --> 00:08:29,133
I don't know. I can't say.

125
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:31,093
Why? Are you scared?

126
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:34,263
That you might die
in the basement like your mom?

127
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:35,348
Shut up.

128
00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:38,351
Why did you run away
with an axe that isn't yours?

129
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:43,189
You were planning to call home.

130
00:08:43,272 --> 00:08:45,525
"I have proof of the serial killings."

131
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:48,569
"So help me escape."

132
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:49,862
Right?

133
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:57,328
Take that to the police station
and turn yourself in.

134
00:08:57,411 --> 00:09:00,373
And tell them who J is.
Your father or brother.

135
00:09:00,456 --> 00:09:02,124
Why should I do that?

136
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,335
Don't you want revenge
on your mom's killer?

137
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:07,797
I'll help you.

138
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,924
I don't trust you.

139
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:11,926
You should.

140
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:16,013
Because your brother and father
will kill you.

141
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:22,186
Fine. Then let's make a bet.

142
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:31,404
Shouldn't we just take the ax?

143
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:34,407
No. He has to turn himself in

144
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:36,450
so we can use him as a witness later.

145
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:39,495
But do you think he'll do it?

146
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:41,706
We'll find out.

147
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:49,839
<i>Call home as you planned to.</i>

148
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:52,300
<i>If your father and brother help you,</i>

149
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:53,551
I'll walk away.

150
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:57,221
But if I'm right,
you have to cooperate with me.

151
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:58,931
What do you say?

152
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,031
<i>Hello?</i>

153
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:17,992
Taegyu. It's me.

154
00:10:18,075 --> 00:10:19,327
Help me.

155
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:21,495
<i>Where are you?
I'll send someone now.</i>

156
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:23,080
You won't report me, will you?

157
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:26,459
I won't. Don't worry.

158
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:29,337
Okay. I won't.

159
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:45,603
We should have killed him
along with his mom.

160
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:52,109
Well, it's better late than never.

161

PHOENIX INN

162
00:11:48,332 --> 00:11:50,751
Where are we going?

163
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:56,090
Stop the car. Stop!

164
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:09,729
What the...

165
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:12,857
Who are you? Get out of the way!

166
00:12:14,191 --> 00:12:16,152
- We are...
- Who?

167
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:18,863
Demons.

168
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:52,563
- Let them go after a few days.
- Okay!

169
00:12:52,646 --> 00:12:55,274
- How much of their memories do we erase?
- Just enough.

170
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:56,942
Okay.

171
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:07,912
I won.

172
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:13,209
Are you really going to take revenge
on the guy that killed my mom?

173
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:14,293
Of course.

174
00:13:18,422 --> 00:13:19,423
What are you doing?

175
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:22,176
I'm recalling what you did to me
in the basement.

176
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:23,803
Pisses me off.

177
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:27,139
Let's end this bad blood between us.

178
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:29,350
What do I need to do?

179
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:34,313
THE JUDGE FROM HELL

180
00:13:37,274 --> 00:13:38,692
Where did you get that?

181
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:42,279
He's a sinner who died ten years ago.
For perfect evidence destruction,

182
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:45,825
we're often asked to declare
the bodies of sinners as missing.

183
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:48,702
Our special
preservation technology

184
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:50,496
keeps the body fresh as if they died

185
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:51,997
- just yesterday...
- The note.

186
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:55,835
I wrote what you told me to.

187
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:57,169
MY FATHER AND BROTHER KILLED ME

188
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:58,629
But why are we doing this?

189
00:13:58,712 --> 00:14:01,215
To trick your father and brother
to buy time.

190
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:03,509
So you can live and turn yourself in.

191
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:20,169
Clean up the scene.

192
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:21,378
Yes, ma'am!

193
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:23,881
Protect him until he hands himself over.

194
00:15:23,964 --> 00:15:25,132
Don't worry.

195
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:28,093
And you. Don't hit him.

196
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:30,679
I'll try.

197
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:35,059
Over here.

198
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:40,314
- You called the police?
- I'm not here as an officer.

199
00:15:40,397 --> 00:15:43,359
But as a family member of a victim
waiting for you to turn yourself in.

200
00:15:55,829 --> 00:15:56,830
I'm...

201
00:15:57,706 --> 00:15:58,707
turning myself in.

202
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,212
What's your relationship

203
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:05,047
with the person
who was found dead in your car?

204
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:06,924
I don't know him.

205
00:16:07,007 --> 00:16:10,094
Why did you confine
and assault Kang Bitna?

206
00:16:10,177 --> 00:16:11,637
I don't remember.

207
00:16:12,554 --> 00:16:13,847
Hey, asshole.

208
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:16,266
You attacked Kang Bitna last year.

209
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:18,686
You were trying to kill her again
because you failed then!

210
00:16:19,603 --> 00:16:22,523
Can you lower your voice?

211
00:16:22,606 --> 00:16:25,275
I'll exercise my right
to remain silent until he leaves.

212
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:26,735
What? Your right?

213
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:29,071
You've heard that somewhere, haven't you?

214
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:30,197
I ought to...

215
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:50,801
I'll keep your secret
about killing Kang Bitna forever.

216
00:16:50,884 --> 00:16:53,220
Nor will I punish

217
00:16:53,887 --> 00:16:55,556
or legally sentence you.

218
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:56,932
And revenge for your mother,

219
00:16:57,808 --> 00:16:59,351
you will get it for sure.

220
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:15,200
My father and brother

221
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:17,494
starved my mother to death.

222
00:17:18,495 --> 00:17:20,622
- Do you have proof of that?
- The camcorder.

223
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:22,791
- Where is it?
- I don't know.

224
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:26,754
It was in the basement, but it's gone now.

225
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:33,260
Is Jeong Taegyu J?

226
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:36,430
Or is it Jeong Jaegeol?

227
00:17:38,682 --> 00:17:39,683
That's...

228
00:17:42,936 --> 00:17:46,774
You've turned yourself in,
but why won't you tell the truth?

229
00:17:49,818 --> 00:17:50,903
I won't say more.

230
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:55,991
For confining and assaulting Kang Bitna,
I will accept punishment.

231
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:58,994
So please make sure my mother's killers

232
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:01,205
get what they deserve, too.

233
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:04,750
<i>Daon.</i>

234
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:08,003
We sent the ax to NFS for testing.

235
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:10,547
It's been expedited,
so we'll hear back in three days.

236
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:14,885
I shouldn't have said that here.

237
00:18:15,552 --> 00:18:18,055
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

238
00:18:26,021 --> 00:18:28,023
{\an8}DETENTION

239
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:30,651
Thanks for cooperating with us.

240
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:36,323
Damn it!

241
00:18:36,406 --> 00:18:38,909
God damn it!

242
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:41,203
I should've killed him.

243
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:44,706
Sir.

244
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:47,501
What did that asshole say to the police?

245
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:49,086
We don't know yet.

246
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:53,841
Also, we suspect the redevelopment project
will be suspended.

247
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:56,051
I think the assemblyman got cold feet.

248
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:58,595
It doesn't matter. What I want to know is

249
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:01,348
what Jeong Seonho said
and when he's being released.

250
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:05,310
Because he held captive
an incumbent judge, he'll...

251
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:07,020
God damn it!

252
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:09,648
Make sure you bring him to me, okay?

253
00:19:09,731 --> 00:19:10,899
Yes, sir.

254
00:19:17,364 --> 00:19:21,034
Sir, we got this information
from Nobong Police Station.

255
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:24,663
When Seonho turned himself in,
he handed over a weapon

256
00:19:25,622 --> 00:19:28,208
saying it was proof of the serial murders.

257
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:31,253
A weapon?

258
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:34,006
- What weapon?
- Well, it's...

259
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:42,514
Tell me now.

260
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:44,892
Sir, it's a hand ax.

261
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:50,022
An ax...

262
00:20:00,657 --> 00:20:03,035
Hey, this is big!

263
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:06,288
Jeong Taegyu bribed an assemblyman

264
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:09,291
to smooth over
the redevelopment of Hwangcheon.

265
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:10,792
Is there proof?

266
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:13,003
A clip was deleted
from the golf course camera.

267
00:20:13,086 --> 00:20:14,880
But I restored all of it.

268
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:17,633
They're saying the redevelopment
of that area is illegal.

269
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:18,842
Could it be suspended?

270
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:21,345
- Of course.
- Get ready to question Jeong Taegyu.

271
00:20:21,428 --> 00:20:22,763
I will, damn it...

272
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:27,267
I'm sorry, sir.

273
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:28,769
I'm just so excited.

274
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:31,146
And as you instructed,

275
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,815
we leaked information
about the ax Jeong Seonho turned in

276
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:35,108
so Jeong Taegyu finds out.

277
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:36,443
Okay, good.

278
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:38,946
Now explain, Daon.

279
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:40,906
Why did you suggest we leak that?

280
00:20:42,824 --> 00:20:44,576
Jeong Jaegeol and Jeong Taegyu,

281
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:47,746
we'll make
the real criminal make his move.

282
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:50,832
That way, you can take care of him

283
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,876
before the results on the ax come out.

284
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:58,006
Because I think
that will help us find J faster.

285
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:09,977
You're back late.

286
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:14,731
Damn it!

287
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:22,406
I remember the first day I met you.

288
00:21:23,198 --> 00:21:25,909
You had that same look in your eyes then.

289
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:31,373
Jeong Seonho has evidence.

290
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:33,041
That's impossible.

291
00:21:34,501 --> 00:21:35,794
Go check right now.

292
00:21:35,877 --> 00:21:37,462
There's no need.

293
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:40,132
Really? We're accomplices.

294
00:21:40,215 --> 00:21:41,758
No, Taegyu.

295
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:45,595
You did those things.

296
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:48,056
You told me to, asshole!

297
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,435
I only made suggestions.
You made the choice.

298
00:21:52,602 --> 00:21:54,938
Now you must take responsibility
for that choice.

299
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:09,870
Do you know why

300
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:13,081
I moved slowly on redeveloping Hwangcheon?

301
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:18,086
The Kylum, which you dropped in Hwangcheon
when you escaped from Hell,

302
00:22:19,212 --> 00:22:20,630
I already found it.

303
00:22:21,631 --> 00:22:23,508
In the building next to Hwangcheon Villa.

304
00:22:25,802 --> 00:22:27,346
Where is the Kylum?

305
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:31,975
Go down and check
if the ax is there first.

306
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:39,775
Hurry up!

307
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,698
The candles are still burning.

308
00:22:47,574 --> 00:22:49,993
Which means no one's been inside.

309
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:51,870
Shut up and check it.

310
00:23:36,164 --> 00:23:38,333
Jeong Seonho can't come in here.

311
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:40,877
Who was it?

312
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:04,901
My hunch was right.

313
00:24:05,485 --> 00:24:07,320
Kang Bitna.

314
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:23,295
Hello, dear.

315
00:24:24,504 --> 00:24:26,256
I'm sure it's been stifling in there.

316
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:29,050
I'll let you out soon.

317
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:47,569
- Is it there?
- No.

318
00:24:56,828 --> 00:24:58,163
Who did this?

319
00:24:58,246 --> 00:24:59,581
Kang Bitna.

320
00:25:00,707 --> 00:25:01,958
She's a demon?

321
00:25:03,418 --> 00:25:05,295
That damn bitch!

322
00:25:06,296 --> 00:25:08,215
I'm going to kill her.

323
00:25:08,298 --> 00:25:09,716
You can't kill her.

324
00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:11,510
Then what am I supposed to do?

325
00:25:12,594 --> 00:25:13,845
Give me the Kylum.

326
00:25:14,429 --> 00:25:18,225
Then I'll send you abroad
along with all my assets.

327
00:25:18,308 --> 00:25:20,143
How can I trust you?

328
00:25:20,227 --> 00:25:22,395
Just now you tried to abandon me.

329
00:25:22,479 --> 00:25:25,857
Fine. Then hand over
the Kylum at the airport.

330
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:28,443
Give it to the person I send to you.

331
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:31,404
And you can leave the country right away.

332
00:25:42,165 --> 00:25:43,750
Call me when you're ready.

333
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:46,002
You'll have to

334
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:48,338
move quicker than the police.

335
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:59,516
By the way, how did you do that?

336
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:20,370
<i>Wow.</i>

337
00:26:20,453 --> 00:26:23,206
You're so smart.

338
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:29,296
You've been writing
Jeong Jaegeol and Jeong Taegyu all day.

339
00:26:29,379 --> 00:26:31,298
You'll wear off your fingerprint.

340
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:33,091
There's no other way.

341
00:26:34,801 --> 00:26:36,845
JEONG TAEGYU

342
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:39,723
TAEOK INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT

343
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:07,834
DEMON BASTARD

344
00:27:08,418 --> 00:27:10,420
<i>It's all ready.
Come to the house.</i>

345
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:29,314
HWANGCHEON VILLA

346
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:44,287
- That's...
- The Kylum!

347
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:52,754
- I'll come, too.
- You two stay here.

348
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:53,838
But...

349
00:27:54,422 --> 00:27:58,802
If we knew we'd find it this easily,
we only would've stared into this thing.

350
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:02,097
Shut it.

351
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:17,112
It's a forged passport.

352
00:28:18,655 --> 00:28:21,658
You'll be able to withdraw the money
as soon as you arrive.

353
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:25,370
The Kylum.

354
00:28:27,455 --> 00:28:29,040
Can you show it to me?

355
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:56,151
"When a demon lives in a human,

356
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:58,236
once the human body dies,

357
00:28:58,903 --> 00:29:02,365
the demon dies with it."

358
00:29:02,449 --> 00:29:05,076
That's what you told me
the first time we met.

359
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,828
You can't kill me.

360
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:08,538
I'm your father.

361
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:19,758
No.

362
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:22,135
My father died 26 years ago.

363
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:50,914
Mr. Jeong Taegyu?

364
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:54,209
- Yes.
- Please follow me. This way.

365
00:30:09,098 --> 00:30:11,059
I will check your ticket and passport.

366
00:30:18,733 --> 00:30:20,401
I was told you have something for me.

367
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:22,320
No, I don't.

368
00:30:24,572 --> 00:30:25,824
Get it.

369
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:29,536
Who are you?

370
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:35,250
Give it.

371
00:30:54,435 --> 00:30:56,896
I killed you.

372
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:59,983
You did, in the illusion I created.

373
00:31:05,947 --> 00:31:09,993
I use desires hidden deep
within humans' hearts to lure them.

374
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:15,164
What you've seen is nothing but
what your heart desires.

375
00:31:16,332 --> 00:31:18,626
You wanted to kill me, Taegyu!

376
00:31:24,465 --> 00:31:26,009
Do you know why I'm sparing your life?

377
00:31:27,677 --> 00:31:30,388
Because spending the rest
of your life in prison

378
00:31:31,139 --> 00:31:34,183
will be a harsher punishment than death.

379
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:38,438
I'm sorry I won't be able to
send you any care packages.

380
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:40,440
Come here.

381
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:42,567
Come here, damn it.

382
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:43,735
Where are you going?

383
00:31:44,819 --> 00:31:46,696
Come here, you bastard!

384
00:31:46,779 --> 00:31:48,156
I'll kill you!

385
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:50,199
Hey! Damn it!

386
00:31:52,452 --> 00:31:53,912
Jeong Taegyu is J?

387
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:55,121
Yes.

388
00:31:55,204 --> 00:31:57,290
The forensic results are in from NFS.

389
00:31:57,373 --> 00:31:58,958
"The blood on the ax blade

390
00:31:59,042 --> 00:32:01,628
contained the DNA
of serial killer J's victims

391
00:32:01,711 --> 00:32:04,130
and Inspector Kim Soyeong."

392
00:32:04,213 --> 00:32:05,632
"And on the ax handle,

393
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:09,761
Jeong Taegyu's fingerprints were found."

394
00:32:11,971 --> 00:32:14,140
- Let's go get him.
- Yes, sir.

395
00:32:14,223 --> 00:32:15,224
Yes, sir.

396
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:20,396
Forensic results of the ax are in.

397
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:22,315
Jeong Taegyu is J.

398
00:32:22,398 --> 00:32:23,816
And also Satan.

399
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,860
<i>We're on our way
to Jeong Taegyu's house.</i>

400
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:28,321
I'll get there first. See you there.

401
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:24,961
Finally, I'll be immortal.

402
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:06,419
It was you?

403
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:14,594
You have ten seconds
to tell me what happened.

404
00:34:14,677 --> 00:34:16,804
Ten, seven, three...

405
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:18,264
Let me go, and let's talk.

406
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:21,100
We hail from the same place.

407
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:23,227
I'm in no mood to chat with you.

408
00:34:26,147 --> 00:34:27,356
Go to Hell.

409
00:34:30,651 --> 00:34:32,278
You're Justitia.

410
00:34:32,361 --> 00:34:34,822
Don't you dare say my name
with that filthy mouth.

411
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:38,493
Don't you want to know
how Jeong Taegyu became serial killer J?

412
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:40,578
No. Just die.

413
00:34:40,661 --> 00:34:42,080
Han Daon!

414
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:45,333
It's related
to his deceased parents as well.

415
00:34:51,214 --> 00:34:52,924
Twenty-six years ago,

416
00:34:53,508 --> 00:34:56,636
my rebellion failed,
and I escaped from Hell.

417
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:00,807
<i>I was injured during the escape</i>

418
00:35:01,891 --> 00:35:06,104
<i>and had lost the Kylum, too.
I wandered aimlessly when I met him.</i>

419
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:17,782
<i>And I could sense it right away.</i>

420
00:35:18,491 --> 00:35:20,785
<i>His bloodthirstiness would save me.</i>

421
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:26,374
Are you here to beg
just because you got into university?

422
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:27,500
I...

423
00:35:31,295 --> 00:35:34,590
I studied really hard even after Mom died

424
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:37,677
because I wanted to be
a son you'd be proud of.

425
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,720
I got into Seoul National University,

426
00:35:41,472 --> 00:35:42,473
Father.

427
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:43,975
Don't call me Father.

428
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:46,435
Your birth was a mistake.

429
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:48,062
My one mistake.

430
00:35:48,896 --> 00:35:51,357
My wife and Seonho will be home soon.

431
00:35:53,192 --> 00:35:55,486
Don't tell anyone you're my son.

432
00:35:57,613 --> 00:35:59,157
Live quietly.

433
00:36:00,908 --> 00:36:01,951
There.

434
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:15,423
A mistake?

435
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:17,383
A mistake?

436
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:32,857
Father.

437
00:36:48,831 --> 00:36:49,832
Damn it!

438
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:52,043
All humans make mistakes.

439
00:36:52,793 --> 00:36:54,962
Who are you?

440
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:58,132
One who will turn your mistake
into an opportunity.

441
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:00,134
A demon.

442
00:37:03,596 --> 00:37:04,639
What?

443
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:07,475
You just wanted him
to acknowledge you as his son.

444
00:37:08,142 --> 00:37:11,520
But he treated you like dirt,
and it made you angry.

445
00:37:11,604 --> 00:37:14,190
I understand your desire to kill him.

446
00:37:19,195 --> 00:37:20,738
What do you know?

447
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:27,828
I'm a demon.

448
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:30,248
I know how far people can fall.

449
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:33,751
You must kill people for me

450
00:37:34,335 --> 00:37:36,963
and bring me different body parts
from their bodies.

451
00:37:37,046 --> 00:37:39,257
And when all the parts are collected,

452
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:42,551
you'll help me find the Kylum.

453
00:37:42,635 --> 00:37:43,636
Easy, right?

454
00:37:43,719 --> 00:37:46,931
I don't understand what you're saying.

455
00:37:48,015 --> 00:37:50,977
Why should I kill for you?

456
00:37:52,687 --> 00:37:55,356
Because it needs to look like
murder committed by a human.

457
00:37:56,023 --> 00:37:58,693
I'm actually on the run.

458
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:06,909
Fine. Let's say you're a demon.

459
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,622
If I kill for you,

460
00:38:12,415 --> 00:38:13,833
what do I get?

461
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:23,968
I will remove the stench from your body.

462
00:38:24,927 --> 00:38:28,639
The stench of poverty
you've spent your life loathing

463
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:30,182
but couldn't shake off.

464
00:38:36,605 --> 00:38:37,940
If you work with me,

465
00:38:38,024 --> 00:38:41,777
you'll no longer have to beg
for money, honor, or your father's love.

466
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:43,738
You'll have everything

467
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:46,365
and rise above
everybody else in this world.

468
00:38:46,949 --> 00:38:50,119
Who are you to be offering me that?

469
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:52,830
Wander in your desires.

470
00:39:36,457 --> 00:39:37,708
My son.

471
00:39:52,348 --> 00:39:54,266
<i>I picked a good one.</i>

472
00:39:55,017 --> 00:39:57,311
<i>Even from his first killing,
he was flawless.</i>

473
00:40:23,712 --> 00:40:25,381
Your bastard son

474
00:40:25,464 --> 00:40:26,715
has killed someone!

475
00:40:30,886 --> 00:40:32,972
<i>Of course, there were obstacles.</i>

476
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:35,724
Water.

477
00:40:35,808 --> 00:40:37,977
<i>But they were easily handled.</i>

478
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:43,816
<i>As if enjoying the hunt,
Taegyu expertly selected his targets.</i>

479
00:40:44,608 --> 00:40:46,360
I'm here to inspect your gas.

480
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:48,070
Of course, hello.

481
00:40:48,154 --> 00:40:49,405
Please come in this way.

482
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:56,871
<i>The last one
was also perfectly executed.</i>

483
00:40:56,954 --> 00:41:00,583
Just for that reason,
you killed innocent people

484
00:41:00,666 --> 00:41:03,002
and Han Daon's family?

485
00:41:03,085 --> 00:41:05,921
It's worth it. Immortality is a blessing.

486
00:41:06,005 --> 00:41:08,215
A blessing I have given myself.

487
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:09,467
The Kylum!

488
00:41:10,843 --> 00:41:12,428
I'll give it to you.

489
00:41:12,511 --> 00:41:13,679
I don't need it.

490
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:16,474
I promised I'd bring it and you to Bael.

491
00:41:16,557 --> 00:41:19,393
Don't you want to stay with Han Daon
forever in human form?

492
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:21,479
The body's already prepared.

493
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:23,939
All you need is the Kylum
to enter that body.

494
00:41:24,023 --> 00:41:26,484
You can live on forever
in the way you want to.

495
00:41:26,567 --> 00:41:28,611
And by your lover's side.

496
00:41:44,835 --> 00:41:46,587
You are so beautiful!

497
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:47,880
Congratulations!

498
00:41:50,966 --> 00:41:53,135
Gosh, the groom is so handsome!

499
00:41:55,262 --> 00:41:57,348
So beautiful!

500
00:42:01,769 --> 00:42:04,647
Look how gorgeous!

501
00:42:09,109 --> 00:42:10,778
So pretty!

502
00:42:47,523 --> 00:42:50,526
<i>You whom I have resurrected,</i>

503
00:42:50,609 --> 00:42:53,696
rise from the death and obey.

504
00:42:54,321 --> 00:42:57,324
Awaken from the darkness

505
00:42:57,408 --> 00:43:02,621
and slay your enemies.

506
00:43:53,547 --> 00:43:56,550
I didn't even imagine
you had such a desire.

507
00:43:57,134 --> 00:43:58,594
You've become a human.

508
00:43:58,677 --> 00:44:00,137
You don't repent, do you?

509
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:01,555
Nor do I regret.

510
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:03,641
Carry out
your remaining punishment in Hell.

511
00:44:03,724 --> 00:44:05,476
Don't trust Bael.

512
00:44:05,559 --> 00:44:07,478
He's the demon of all demons!

513
00:44:12,107 --> 00:44:14,735
You're wrong. The demon of all demons

514
00:44:15,444 --> 00:44:16,445
is me.

515
00:45:10,165 --> 00:45:12,668
Now that I'm no longer
in that old man's body...

516
00:45:17,256 --> 00:45:18,924
I can put up a good fight.

517
00:45:19,758 --> 00:45:20,968
You wish.

518
00:45:45,993 --> 00:45:48,579
There are ranks even among demonic powers.

519
00:45:49,455 --> 00:45:51,206
I may be hurt,

520
00:45:51,957 --> 00:45:53,751
but you can't beat me.

521
00:45:55,377 --> 00:45:56,628
Wander in your nightmares.

522
00:46:37,252 --> 00:46:38,253
Damn it.

523
00:46:51,517 --> 00:46:54,019
I'll kill you.

524
00:47:21,129 --> 00:47:22,506
Go to Hell.

525
00:47:47,656 --> 00:47:48,657
{\an8}geenna

526
00:47:50,325 --> 00:47:51,326
No.

527
00:47:55,163 --> 00:47:56,248
Please, no!

528
00:47:59,376 --> 00:48:03,547
No!

529
00:48:30,908 --> 00:48:31,909
There.

530
00:48:34,244 --> 00:48:35,245
Over there.

531
00:48:41,752 --> 00:48:43,795
<i>Incheon Port.
Jeong Taegyu got away.</i>

532
00:48:43,879 --> 00:48:44,922
Incheon Port?

533
00:49:50,737 --> 00:49:51,863
What the...

534
00:49:55,325 --> 00:49:56,910
Why did it suddenly stop?

535
00:49:56,994 --> 00:49:59,121
Seriously? God damn it.

536
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:09,506
Just a second. I'll fix it right away.

537
00:50:09,589 --> 00:50:11,508
Damn it.

538
00:50:13,677 --> 00:50:15,387
Jeong Taegyu, you son of a bitch!

539
00:50:16,263 --> 00:50:18,223
Die! Die, you bastard!

540
00:50:24,187 --> 00:50:25,856
- Who are you?
- Let's go together.

541
00:50:26,481 --> 00:50:27,524
To Hell.

542
00:50:28,775 --> 00:50:30,277
- Are you a detective?
- No.

543
00:50:30,819 --> 00:50:32,154
I'm the son of your victims.

544
00:50:39,077 --> 00:50:40,662
When did he get on?

545
00:50:45,751 --> 00:50:46,793
What?

546
00:50:47,294 --> 00:50:48,670
Damn it.

547
00:51:08,482 --> 00:51:09,858
It's been a while.

548
00:51:09,941 --> 00:51:13,195
Have we... met?

549
00:51:13,278 --> 00:51:14,946
The last murders you committed.

550
00:51:15,030 --> 00:51:17,324
I'm the only survivor
of the Yeonju-dong murder.

551
00:51:18,366 --> 00:51:19,618
Ah.

552
00:51:20,952 --> 00:51:22,579
You were that kid?

553
00:51:24,081 --> 00:51:26,416
It's so nice to see you.

554
00:51:26,666 --> 00:51:28,627
Yeah, you too.

555
00:51:29,294 --> 00:51:30,837
I've waited 25 years.

556
00:51:34,966 --> 00:51:37,719
That's exactly what she said.

557
00:51:40,138 --> 00:51:41,139
Kim...

558
00:51:42,057 --> 00:51:43,058
So...

559
00:51:44,017 --> 00:51:45,018
yeong.

560
00:51:52,901 --> 00:51:54,152
<i>Don't move! I'll shoot!</i>

561
00:51:56,613 --> 00:51:58,949
It's you.

562
00:52:01,368 --> 00:52:05,080
I've waited for 25 years.

563
00:52:09,543 --> 00:52:11,044
We finally meet.

564
00:53:13,523 --> 00:53:15,525
You shouldn't have tried so hard.

565
00:53:15,609 --> 00:53:19,070
Why did you follow me? Now look at you.

566
00:53:27,871 --> 00:53:28,872
Goodbye.

567
00:53:35,503 --> 00:53:36,588
Shit!

568
00:53:38,256 --> 00:53:40,967
Jeong Taegyu, you're under arrest

569
00:53:41,051 --> 00:53:43,511
for the J serial killings

570
00:53:44,471 --> 00:53:46,223
and for harming a police officer.

571
00:53:47,307 --> 00:53:49,392
Wait. I'll turn myself in.

572
00:53:50,977 --> 00:53:53,355
Here. Cuff me.

573
00:54:33,603 --> 00:54:35,897
Does it hurt? Beg for your life.

574
00:54:35,981 --> 00:54:37,357
You're pathetic.

575
00:54:38,191 --> 00:54:39,192
And pitiful.

576
00:54:39,776 --> 00:54:42,112
- I feel sorry for you.
- What?

577
00:54:42,195 --> 00:54:46,074
People like you
who don't know how to repent,

578
00:54:46,157 --> 00:54:49,244
are the most pitiful in the world.

579
00:54:50,203 --> 00:54:53,039
I'll make sure you regret saying that.

580
00:55:11,766 --> 00:55:13,601
JEONG TAEGYU

581
00:55:24,696 --> 00:55:26,323
This is your last chance.

582
00:55:27,574 --> 00:55:28,575
Beg for your life.

583
00:55:28,658 --> 00:55:30,410
You beg for forgiveness!

584
00:55:31,161 --> 00:55:32,829
From all those you've killed.

585
00:55:33,413 --> 00:55:35,332
Beg before I kill you!

586
00:55:35,999 --> 00:55:37,167
Even if I die,

587
00:55:38,084 --> 00:55:40,295
my colleagues will catch you.

588
00:55:40,378 --> 00:55:44,174
You'll be put on trial
and punished for your crimes.

589
00:55:45,175 --> 00:55:47,385
In life, you'll rot in jail.

590
00:55:47,469 --> 00:55:49,888
In death, you'll burn in Hell,
Jeong Taegyu!

591
00:55:51,473 --> 00:55:52,599
You little...

592
00:56:03,526 --> 00:56:05,320
Is this why you were so cocky?

593
00:56:05,403 --> 00:56:06,613
They'll get you...

594
00:56:09,282 --> 00:56:10,533
no matter what.

595
00:56:35,767 --> 00:56:37,268
I usually...

596
00:56:38,019 --> 00:56:39,854
dismember them after I kill them.

597
00:56:40,355 --> 00:56:44,275
But I didn't want to
show that officer any mercy.

598
00:56:46,486 --> 00:56:49,697
I was so angry, you know?

599
00:56:50,532 --> 00:56:51,908
So...

600
00:56:55,286 --> 00:56:57,122
I cut it off when she was still alive.

601
00:56:59,916 --> 00:57:02,043
Chop, chop.

602
00:57:03,169 --> 00:57:05,630
Chop!

603
00:57:05,797 --> 00:57:07,257
You asshole!

604
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:23,606
Damn it.

605
00:57:30,196 --> 00:57:31,448
You bastard.

606
00:57:32,490 --> 00:57:33,491
Die!

607
00:57:45,753 --> 00:57:47,130
Die, you bastard!

608
00:58:04,397 --> 00:58:06,065
Say what you did was wrong.

609
00:58:06,149 --> 00:58:07,734
Beg for forgiveness!

610
00:58:08,776 --> 00:58:10,737
From all those you've killed.

611
00:58:14,199 --> 00:58:15,366
And from me.

612
00:58:17,327 --> 00:58:19,120
I'm sorry.

613
00:58:22,582 --> 00:58:24,501
Please forgive me.

614
00:58:29,464 --> 00:58:30,673
Like this?

615
00:58:41,643 --> 00:58:44,395
The boat Jeong Taegyu's on
leaves in an hour.

616
00:58:45,730 --> 00:58:46,856
I'm going to kill him.

617
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:48,441
If you kill him,

618
00:58:48,983 --> 00:58:52,779
I will give everything as a demon
to protect you in Hell.

619
00:58:52,862 --> 00:58:55,114
But if you let him live,

620
00:58:55,198 --> 00:58:58,701
I will give everything as a judge
to make sure he's punished.

621
00:58:59,202 --> 00:59:00,203
Legally.

622
00:59:01,287 --> 00:59:04,332
Whatever you choose, I trust you.

623
00:59:04,958 --> 00:59:06,417
So you should trust me, too,

624
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:08,962
and do what you want.

625
00:59:09,546 --> 00:59:13,132
The duty of a police officer
is to reveal the crime, not punish.

626
00:59:13,216 --> 00:59:15,718
We investigate according to procedure,

627
00:59:15,802 --> 00:59:17,720
and judges punish with verdicts.

628
00:59:17,804 --> 00:59:19,222
Legally and fairly.

629
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:21,641
Promise me.

630
00:59:22,767 --> 00:59:24,644
Wherever you are and whatever you do,

631
00:59:24,727 --> 00:59:26,938
don't ever forget that you're a detective.

632
00:59:34,362 --> 00:59:38,116
You idiot.

633
00:59:56,843 --> 00:59:58,136
Jeong Taegyu.

634
00:59:58,219 --> 01:00:01,431
You're under arrest for killing
the J serial murder victims

635
01:00:01,514 --> 01:00:04,183
and Inspector Kim Soyeong.

636
01:00:04,267 --> 01:00:06,311
You have the right
to remain silent!

637
01:00:06,394 --> 01:00:08,021
And the right to an attorney.

638
01:00:10,273 --> 01:00:12,358
You may refuse any unfair statement.

639
01:00:15,778 --> 01:00:16,988
What the...

640
01:00:22,535 --> 01:00:24,329
Damn it!

641
01:00:25,371 --> 01:00:28,333
What an idiot.

642
01:00:32,670 --> 01:00:33,671
Damn it.

643
01:00:33,755 --> 01:00:35,173
- My leg hurts!
- Asshole.

644
01:00:42,013 --> 01:00:44,349
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

645
01:00:45,266 --> 01:00:48,144
Detective. You were so cool back there.

646
01:00:48,227 --> 01:00:50,188
Had your parents seen you,

647
01:00:50,271 --> 01:00:53,608
they would have said,
"Our son has grown up so well."

648
01:00:53,691 --> 01:00:56,486
"We're so proud of our son."

649
01:00:59,155 --> 01:01:01,199
- Well, then...
- Of course.

650
01:01:17,131 --> 01:01:19,217
{\an8}OLD HAG

651
01:01:20,927 --> 01:01:22,220
What?

652
01:01:23,054 --> 01:01:26,349
SOON-TO-BE-DEAD

653
01:01:26,432 --> 01:01:28,559
Why is a soon-to-be-dead woman calling me?

654
01:01:28,643 --> 01:01:30,228
Can I ask a favor?

655
01:01:30,311 --> 01:01:32,647
To get Han Daon on the boat?

656
01:01:34,190 --> 01:01:35,358
How did you know?

657
01:01:35,441 --> 01:01:37,318
I know everything you do.

658
01:01:39,946 --> 01:01:42,907
You said you couldn't protect him.
That it's up to me now.

659
01:01:42,990 --> 01:01:46,536
I was bluffing to see what you'd do.

660
01:01:48,538 --> 01:01:49,539
What?

661
01:01:51,290 --> 01:01:52,917
The boat can be stopped,

662
01:01:53,418 --> 01:01:56,045
but I can't stop Han Daon
from going to Hell.

663
01:02:00,675 --> 01:02:03,386
Don't worry. Even if he goes to Hell,
I'll protect him.

664
01:03:48,783 --> 01:03:50,117
COURT

665
01:03:56,833 --> 01:03:58,042
KICK KANG BITNA OUT!

666
01:03:58,125 --> 01:03:59,544
WHERE'S A JUDGE'S CONSCIENCE?

667
01:03:59,627 --> 01:04:01,587
THE JUDICIARY IS DEAD
THERE IS NO JUSTICE

668
01:04:01,671 --> 01:04:04,048
KANG BITNA OUT
WE DON'T NEED TRASH

669
01:04:10,304 --> 01:04:13,224
Judge Kang!
Stop handing down

670
01:04:13,307 --> 01:04:14,892
unjust rulings!

671
01:04:14,976 --> 01:04:16,978
Stop!

672
01:04:17,061 --> 01:04:19,105
{\an8}<i>While Assemblyman Jeong remains missing,</i>

673
01:04:19,188 --> 01:04:21,649
{\an8}<i>Jeong Taegyu, CEO of
Taeok Industrial Development,</i>

674
01:04:21,732 --> 01:04:23,860
{\an8}<i>who's been revealed to be serial killer J,</i>

675
01:04:23,943 --> 01:04:26,821
{\an8}<i>will face his first trial
for murdering an officer.</i>

676
01:04:26,904 --> 01:04:29,699
{\an8}<i>However, Judge Kang Bitna,
who's provoked outrage</i>

677
01:04:29,782 --> 01:04:32,285
{\an8}<i>for her controversial rulings,
will be presiding.</i>

678
01:04:32,368 --> 01:04:36,414
{\an8}<i>Thus, there are strong doubts
as to whether a fair trial is possible.</i>

679
01:04:36,497 --> 01:04:37,915
Yes, Assemblyman.

680
01:04:37,999 --> 01:04:40,793
Judge Kang will make sure
everything goes well.

681
01:04:40,877 --> 01:04:42,753
Yes, sir. Goodbye, sir.

682
01:04:46,591 --> 01:04:49,927
Yes, this is Na Yeongjin...

683
01:04:50,011 --> 01:04:52,263
Goodness, Assemblyman Jang.

684
01:04:52,597 --> 01:04:54,849
Don't worry.

685
01:04:54,932 --> 01:04:58,019
As you requested, Judge Kang
will be presiding over this case.

686
01:04:58,102 --> 01:05:00,354
Yes, sir. Yes.

687
01:05:00,438 --> 01:05:04,525
Sounds like Jeong Taegyu's made deals
with many assembly members.

688
01:05:04,609 --> 01:05:06,861
It does. And now
they're all getting anxious.

689
01:05:06,944 --> 01:05:08,613
The phone's ringing off the hook.

690
01:05:10,781 --> 01:05:13,534
Gosh, that's bitter.

691
01:05:16,203 --> 01:05:17,955
Hello, Minister.

692
01:05:38,517 --> 01:05:40,353
I'm sure she couldn't come for a reason.

693
01:05:40,436 --> 01:05:42,813
Think of me as your daughter today.

694
01:05:44,482 --> 01:05:46,233
And I'll be your grandson.

695
01:05:56,035 --> 01:05:57,161
DEFENDANT

696
01:06:16,097 --> 01:06:18,015
You can stop playing judge now.

697
01:06:22,561 --> 01:06:23,896
Bael.

698
01:06:26,857 --> 01:06:30,361
For finding the Kylum
and sending Satan back to Hell,

699
01:06:31,362 --> 01:06:33,364
I forgive all your sins.

700
01:06:34,699 --> 01:06:37,618
I have one last mission for you.
Release Jeong Taegyu,

701
01:06:37,702 --> 01:06:40,246
punish him, and send him directly to Hell.

702
01:06:40,329 --> 01:06:41,622
If you refuse,

703
01:06:43,290 --> 01:06:44,917
you will be dragged to Hell...

704
01:06:47,461 --> 01:06:49,505
and face a terrible death.

705
01:06:58,723 --> 01:07:00,099
Isn't she late?

706
01:07:07,773 --> 01:07:08,941
All rise.

707
01:07:21,078 --> 01:07:22,079
There will be...

708
01:07:26,459 --> 01:07:27,585
no trial.

709
01:07:48,564 --> 01:07:52,109
THE JUDGE FROM HELL

710
01:07:52,193 --> 01:07:53,402
<i>‚ô™ Lost ‚ô™</i>

711
01:07:54,195 --> 01:07:56,530
<i>‚ô™ In the dark alone ‚ô™</i>

712
01:07:59,450 --> 01:08:04,121
<i>‚ô™ What is the aim of justice ‚ô™</i>

713
01:08:04,205 --> 01:08:06,123
<i>‚ô™ Justice, justice ‚ô™</i>

714
01:08:13,464 --> 01:08:15,216
{\an8}<i>If you don't release Jeong Taegyu,
you'll die.</i>

715
01:08:15,299 --> 01:08:16,884
{\an8}Just wrap up the trial and let him go.

716
01:08:16,967 --> 01:08:19,678
{\an8}- I'm a judge.
You're a demon first.

717
01:08:19,762 --> 01:08:21,430
{\an8}Let him go.

718
01:08:21,514 --> 01:08:24,725
{\an8}Taeok Industrial Development building
basement level 5 wasn't searched.

719
01:08:24,809 --> 01:08:26,477
{\an8}- Let's go.
Freeze!

720
01:08:27,853 --> 01:08:29,146
{\an8}What is this?

721
01:08:29,230 --> 01:08:31,899
{\an8}Let's make a trade.
I'll have you released.

722
01:08:31,982 --> 01:08:34,652
{\an8}We need to play our parts.

723
01:08:35,111 --> 01:08:37,947
{\an8}<i>If I give Jeong Taegyu a light sentence,</i>

724
01:08:38,030 --> 01:08:39,406
{\an8}will you hate me?

725
01:08:39,490 --> 01:08:40,741
{\an8}<i> I trust you.</i>

726
01:08:41,242 --> 01:08:43,244
{\an8}It's only right
that a criminal must be punished.

727
01:08:43,369 --> 01:08:45,454
{\an8}Let that be a reality, not a miracle.

728
01:08:45,538 --> 01:08:46,831
{\an8}However, regarding these crimes,

729
01:08:46,914 --> 01:08:49,750
{\an8}the statute of limitations
has already ended in 2014.

730
01:08:49,834 --> 01:08:51,919
{\an8}- That crime was not considered.

731
01:08:52,503 --> 01:08:55,131
{\an8}Han Daon. She's going to die!

732
01:08:55,214 --> 01:08:57,716
{\an8}<i>- You really won't regret this?
- Kang Bitna!</i>

733
01:08:59,677 --> 01:09:01,345
{\an8}<i>I wouldn't have started
if I was going to.</i>

734
01:09:01,887 --> 01:09:04,473
{\an8}<i>Don't die, please!
Please, Kang Bitna!</i>
