he referred to them as masterpieces.

Maybe it's not just Seonho's mother...

124
00:09:22,732 --> 00:09:27,028
The tapes might also contain
the last moments of the other victims.

but the actual owner is the defendant.

How can we trust a statement
from someone who has spent

179
00:12:30,879 --> 00:12:32,339
half their life on drugs?

180
00:12:32,422 --> 00:12:33,798
[prosecutor] Your Honor.

181
00:12:33,882 --> 00:12:35,884
That is unrelated to this case.

182
00:12:37,469 --> 00:12:39,095
Agreed. Please omit it.

183
00:12:39,888 --> 00:12:40,972
[prosecutor] Your Honor.

184
00:12:42,224 --> 00:12:45,644
There is a witness
who saw the defendant kill the victim.

185
00:12:46,311 --> 00:12:47,479
[intense whispering]

186
00:12:52,859 --> 00:12:55,987
[prosecutor] The witness is currently
injured and cannot move easily.

187
00:12:56,071 --> 00:12:57,989
Please wait a little longer.

188
00:12:59,574 --> 00:13:01,993
Your Honor, he is still not here,

189
00:13:02,077 --> 00:13:04,704
which shows he is unwilling to testify.

190
00:13:05,413 --> 00:13:08,375
Please use your best judgment.

191
00:13:10,168 --> 00:13:11,253
[sighs]

192
00:13:12,712 --> 00:13:15,048
As the witness is not present,
today's trial...

[sighs]

198
00:13:38,613 --> 00:13:39,990
I'm sorry I'm late.

199
00:13:46,037 --> 00:13:47,831
I won't testify, Detective.

200
00:13:48,498 --> 00:13:50,667
-Mr. Jeong...
-I'm sorry.

201
00:13:52,502 --> 00:13:53,712
Please leave.

202
00:13:59,634 --> 00:14:02,929
You want to reveal the truth
about your mother's wrongful death.

203
00:14:03,555 --> 00:14:05,473
Do not pass up the opportunity

204
00:14:06,057 --> 00:14:07,976
to speak the truth

205
00:14:09,603 --> 00:14:11,021
and save yourself.

206
00:14:30,165 --> 00:14:33,460
COURT IN SESSION

207
00:14:33,543 --> 00:14:37,672
[prosecutor] Did you just stand by
while the victim was being murdered?

208
00:14:38,298 --> 00:14:40,175
The detective suppressed my brother,

209
00:14:40,926 --> 00:14:44,346
but before she could cuff him,
I stabbed her in the shoulder.

210
00:14:44,429 --> 00:14:45,639
[Seonho grunts]

211

[people gasping]

212
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:56,107
Then my brother used the ax

213
00:14:56,775 --> 00:14:57,859
on her arm...

214
00:14:58,401 --> 00:14:59,402
[sighs]

215
00:14:59,486 --> 00:15:01,446
Even if I die,

216
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:03,573
my colleagues will catch you.

217
00:15:03,657 --> 00:15:06,576
You'll be put on trial
and punished for your crimes.

218
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:08,411
[Soyeong screaming]

219
00:15:14,709 --> 00:15:17,295
Why did you stab the victim?

220
00:15:17,379 --> 00:15:19,673
I thought if my brother was arrested,
I'd be too.

221
00:15:19,756 --> 00:15:22,133
Because I was the one
who attacked that woman

222
00:15:22,759 --> 00:15:24,386
in Hwangcheon.

223
00:15:25,303 --> 00:15:26,304
[Jeongim screaming]

224
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:27,764

[sobbing softly]

226
00:15:33,436 --> 00:15:35,188
[Seonho] I was afraid
I'd get caught for that.

227
00:15:36,273 --> 00:15:38,942
[prosecutor] Why did you attack
a resident of Hwangcheon?

228
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:41,736
[sighs]

229
00:15:43,071 --> 00:15:44,614
My brother told me to.

230
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:48,159
Because those residents
refused to leave the villa,

231
00:15:48,243 --> 00:15:50,120
he said they all had to be killed.

232
00:15:50,412 --> 00:15:51,872
[♪ dramatic music playing]

233
00:15:51,955 --> 00:15:53,290
[people gasping]

234
00:15:55,834 --> 00:15:57,794
Only then
could the redevelopment go ahead.

235
00:15:59,379 --> 00:16:00,839
[people whispering]

236
00:16:02,382 --> 00:16:06,970
Is there anything you'd like to say
to the victim and her family?

237
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:11,224
[softly] I'm sorry.

238
00:16:20,192 --> 00:16:21,610
[whispering increases]

239
00:16:23,278 --> 00:16:24,362
[in normal voice] I'm sorry.

240
00:16:25,864 --> 00:16:27,073
I was wrong.

241
00:16:27,991 --> 00:16:31,578
[loudly] Please forgive me. I did
a terrible, unforgivable thing. I'm sorry.

242
00:16:32,162 --> 00:16:33,288
I'm sorry. [crying]

243
00:16:37,334 --> 00:16:38,376
[prosecutor] No more questions.

244
00:16:43,215 --> 00:16:46,384
Defendant's counsel,
please cross-examine the witness.

245
00:16:53,683 --> 00:16:58,188
You argue that the defendant
is the one who shot the victim.

246
00:16:58,271 --> 00:17:00,190
But do you know that your fingerprints

247
00:17:00,774 --> 00:17:02,817
were found on the firearm
used in the crime?

248
00:17:02,901 --> 00:17:04,486
Yes, I do.

249
00:17:05,654 --> 00:17:08,782
My brother wiped his prints off the gun
and gave it to me.

250
00:17:08,865 --> 00:17:10,367
He told me to keep it.

251
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:11,910
You have a drug conviction, correct?

252
00:17:14,287 --> 00:17:15,288
I do.

253
00:17:15,372 --> 00:17:17,123
One of the side effects of drugs

254
00:17:17,707 --> 00:17:19,459
is hallucinations.

255
00:17:21,253 --> 00:17:23,505
-Did you take drugs that day, too?
-[prosecutor] Your Honor.

256
00:17:23,588 --> 00:17:26,007
That's unrelated to the case.

257
00:17:26,633 --> 00:17:28,510
Counsel, this is a warning.

258
00:17:34,391 --> 00:17:36,309
During the police investigation,

259
00:17:36,393 --> 00:17:40,063
you claimed the defendant was
the culprit in the J serial killings.

260
00:17:40,856 --> 00:17:42,274
Do you have proof?

261
00:17:42,858 --> 00:17:44,067
I saw it.

262
00:17:45,068 --> 00:17:46,111
On a rainy day

263
00:17:46,945 --> 00:17:48,029
in Hwangcheon,

264
00:17:50,532 --> 00:17:52,325
my brother killed a boy.

265
00:17:52,409 --> 00:17:55,036
[people gasping and whispering]

266
00:17:56,496 --> 00:17:58,582
[Seonho] I saw him killing him

267
00:17:59,875 --> 00:18:02,752
but couldn't do anything
because I was so scared.

268
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:06,506
[breathing shakily]

269
00:18:09,384 --> 00:18:10,427
[breathing heavily]

[Seonho] <i>I felt terrible
and returned to that spot.</i>

271
00:18:31,615 --> 00:18:33,783
<i>And I ran into the boy's mother.</i>

272
00:18:38,205 --> 00:18:40,123
Do you know my Yechan?

273
00:18:42,667 --> 00:18:45,253
Why are you running away?
Did you kill my son? Did you?

274
00:18:45,337 --> 00:18:46,713
[Seonho] No. [yells] I didn't!

275
00:18:49,216 --> 00:18:51,218
-[Myeongsuk] Stop!
-[Seonho] Let go!

276
00:18:51,301 --> 00:18:52,469
[yells] Let go!

[crying]

282
00:19:15,742 --> 00:19:17,452
My brother is a murderer.

283
00:19:18,161 --> 00:19:20,705
He killed innocent, poor people.

284
00:19:20,789 --> 00:19:23,208
And he killed my mother too.

285
00:19:23,291 --> 00:19:26,795
As if it wasn't enough
to lock her up and starve her to death,

286
00:19:26,878 --> 00:19:30,966
he filmed my dying mother with a camcorder
and showed it to me.

287
00:19:31,049 --> 00:19:33,009
-[people gasping]
-[Seonho] Jeong Taegyu.

288
00:19:33,885 --> 00:19:35,971
That man is a demon.

289
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:40,892
[defense attorney] Please, calm down.

290
00:19:40,976 --> 00:19:43,019
Then where are
the camcorder and the tapes?

291
00:19:46,481 --> 00:19:48,650
They were in our basement last December,

292
00:19:50,569 --> 00:19:52,487
but my brother moved them.

293
00:19:53,071 --> 00:19:54,281
[defense attorney] So you're saying

294
00:19:54,364 --> 00:19:57,701
that you don't have evidence
to support your claim?

295
00:19:57,784 --> 00:19:59,077
[yells] I saw it myself!

296
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,871
Please just reply "yes" or "no."

297
00:20:02,163 --> 00:20:03,623
Do you have evidence?

298
00:20:07,377 --> 00:20:09,462
-No.
-[defense attorney] No more questions.

299
00:20:09,546 --> 00:20:11,131
[people continue whispering]

300
00:20:14,676 --> 00:20:17,762
We will conclude today's trial here.

302

-[Donghun] No, there's nothing.

303

What... What is it?
Catch your breath and talk slowly.

306
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:36,865
Taeok Industrial Development building
basement level 5 wasn't searched.

307
00:20:36,948 --> 00:20:40,327
If you see here on the plan,
there's definitely a basement level five.

308
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:42,245
Probably an equipment room
before it was closed.

309
00:20:42,329 --> 00:20:45,040
{\an8}It doesn't connect to the elevator,
so we missed it.

[Daon] Yes.

00:21:07,812 --> 00:21:09,022
It's locked.

[Donghun] What the hell is this?

[crying continues over tape]

343
00:23:38,547 --> 00:23:39,965
[Judge Kang] The police submitted

344
00:23:40,048 --> 00:23:42,008
additional evidence
related to the crime, correct?

345
00:23:43,718 --> 00:23:47,222
Yes. They're videos the defendant recorded

346
00:23:47,305 --> 00:23:48,849
of his past serial killings.

347
00:23:49,182 --> 00:23:50,642
[people gasping]

348
00:23:51,059 --> 00:23:52,519
[defense attorney] Your Honor.

349
00:23:53,478 --> 00:23:56,606
That evidence is unrelated to this case.

350
00:23:56,690 --> 00:23:57,816
[prosecutor] But, Your Honor,

351
00:23:57,899 --> 00:24:01,069
it is evidence that can expose
the defendant's lies.

352
00:24:01,152 --> 00:24:03,154
The evidence in question is not admissible

353
00:24:03,238 --> 00:24:06,324
because of procedural defects
that did not ensure the suspect's right

354
00:24:06,408 --> 00:24:08,869
to participate in the process
of obtaining the evidence.

355
00:24:08,952 --> 00:24:11,329
Well, obviously I'm aware of that too.

356
00:24:12,163 --> 00:24:14,332
Of course, it is not admissible
as evidence.

357
00:24:14,416 --> 00:24:15,417
[scoffs softly]

358
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:17,335
[Judge Kang] As the defendant's counsel
has stated,

359
00:24:17,419 --> 00:24:20,297
this piece of evidence
is not related to this case.

360
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:22,257
However, those tapes clearly

361
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:27,179
contain footage of the defendant killing
the victims of the J serial killings.

362
00:24:28,388 --> 00:24:30,015
I've confirmed for myself.

363
00:24:30,098 --> 00:24:31,808
-[people gasping]
-[Judge Kang] Defendant.

364
00:24:33,476 --> 00:24:34,853
Let me ask you again.

365
00:24:34,936 --> 00:24:37,522
Are you the culprit

366
00:24:38,481 --> 00:24:40,400
-in the J serial killings?
-[defense attorney] Your Honor!

367
00:24:41,067 --> 00:24:42,068
Counsel.

368
00:24:56,625 --> 00:24:59,669
Yes, I killed them all.

369
00:25:00,086 --> 00:25:02,088
[people gasping]

370
00:25:02,172 --> 00:25:03,548
[intense whispering]

371
00:25:11,681 --> 00:25:13,642
[Judge Kang] There are 15 video tapes
capturing

372
00:25:13,725 --> 00:25:16,436
the death of who we assume
to be Jeong Seonho's mother.

373
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:20,732
One video for each of the second
through fifth J serial murder cases

374
00:25:20,815 --> 00:25:22,734
capturing the victims' killings.

375
00:25:24,319 --> 00:25:27,072
There are a total of 19 tapes
submitted as evidence,

376
00:25:27,656 --> 00:25:30,033
and a total of 13 victims killed.

377
00:25:30,659 --> 00:25:32,953
The families of the victims
are here today.

378
00:25:33,745 --> 00:25:35,205
Anything you want to tell them?

379
00:25:53,682 --> 00:25:57,269
I grew up poor.

380
00:25:57,352 --> 00:26:00,355
So I know very well
what it's like to be poor.

381
00:26:01,565 --> 00:26:04,484
If you believe you can
lift yourself out of poverty,

382
00:26:04,568 --> 00:26:07,445
then you've never been poor before.

383
00:26:08,154 --> 00:26:09,447
Being poor

384
00:26:10,198 --> 00:26:11,908
means having no hope.

385
00:26:11,992 --> 00:26:14,452
To satisfy the immediate hunger,

386
00:26:14,536 --> 00:26:17,664
you give up any possible future
you've ever dreamed of

387
00:26:17,747 --> 00:26:21,585
and throw away your pride
for a few pennies.

388
00:26:22,419 --> 00:26:24,087
That's what it means to be poor.

389
00:26:28,175 --> 00:26:32,095
When I became rich by someone's goodwill,
I made a decision.

390
00:26:33,305 --> 00:26:36,474
I was going to liberate people
without hope or a future

391
00:26:36,558 --> 00:26:37,893
like my past self.

392
00:26:37,976 --> 00:26:39,269
[people gasping]

393
00:26:42,439 --> 00:26:45,775
Yes. That's why I killed them.

394
00:26:46,526 --> 00:26:47,944
I only selected the poor.

395
00:26:48,528 --> 00:26:52,908
Of course, I will not deny
the fact that I took pleasure

396
00:26:52,991 --> 00:26:54,451
in killing them.

397
00:26:54,534 --> 00:26:56,077
-That son of...
-Calm down.

398
00:26:56,161 --> 00:26:57,996
At first, it took some getting used to.

399
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:00,040
But it got easier.

400
00:27:00,123 --> 00:27:01,750
[people gasping]

401
00:27:01,833 --> 00:27:03,501
[aggressive whispering]

402
00:27:03,585 --> 00:27:06,213
[Taegyu] When they clung to me,
begging for their lives...

403
00:27:07,214 --> 00:27:08,757
At least in that moment,

404
00:27:09,674 --> 00:27:11,134
I truly was God.

405
00:27:14,387 --> 00:27:16,890
Looking down on someone from up high,

406
00:27:16,973 --> 00:27:20,143
judging their entire life,
and handing down sentences...

407
00:27:20,227 --> 00:27:22,479
It's just so pleasurable. [chuckles]

408
00:27:23,271 --> 00:27:26,566
I'm sure you know the feeling.

409
00:27:29,319 --> 00:27:30,445
[scoffs]

410
00:27:37,118 --> 00:27:39,579
I don't feel any remorse at all.

411
00:27:44,042 --> 00:27:47,504
No, you should be thanking me.

412
00:27:47,587 --> 00:27:51,049
Because I liberated
your precious family members

413
00:27:51,132 --> 00:27:53,218
[yells] from wretched poverty!

414
00:27:53,301 --> 00:27:54,427
[shocked gasps]

415
00:27:57,097 --> 00:27:58,890
Pain is only fleeting,

416
00:27:58,974 --> 00:28:01,476
but rest is eternal.

417
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:05,230
Thanks to me, your family members

418
00:28:05,856 --> 00:28:08,608
escaped poverty and became happy.

419
00:28:08,692 --> 00:28:13,572
It's incomparable to the miserable life
they had with you!

420
00:28:13,655 --> 00:28:16,283
[yelling] You asshole!

421
00:28:16,366 --> 00:28:19,160
I'm going to rip you to shreds!

422
00:28:19,995 --> 00:28:23,623
You bastard! I'm going to kill you myself!

423
00:28:23,707 --> 00:28:25,083
Asshole!

424
00:28:26,251 --> 00:28:30,255
-Just you wait, asshole!
-[crying loudly]

425
00:28:35,427 --> 00:28:37,095
[people exclaiming]

426
00:28:37,804 --> 00:28:39,139
We will take a short break.

427
00:28:48,106 --> 00:28:53,111
Were you the first to discover and report
the inspector's disappearance?

428
00:28:53,195 --> 00:28:54,404
Yes.

429
00:28:54,487 --> 00:28:57,657
Can you describe
the situation at the time?

430
00:28:58,742 --> 00:29:00,327
[Daon] When I got there,

431
00:29:01,203 --> 00:29:03,413
there was blood all over the ground.

432
00:29:03,496 --> 00:29:05,498
[people whispering]

433
00:29:13,131 --> 00:29:14,132
I am

434
00:29:14,966 --> 00:29:17,385
a family member
of the victims of the J serial killings

435
00:29:18,136 --> 00:29:19,554
and the only survivor.

436
00:29:20,722 --> 00:29:22,182
[♪ somber music playing]

437
00:29:24,935 --> 00:29:26,186
Your Honor.

438
00:29:26,269 --> 00:29:28,813
[Daon] I know this trial is
unrelated to that case.

439
00:29:28,897 --> 00:29:30,565
But if not here in this trial,

440
00:29:31,316 --> 00:29:33,777
I will have no opportunity
to share my story.

441
00:29:34,861 --> 00:29:35,946
Please...

442
00:29:37,072 --> 00:29:38,365
give me some time.

443
00:29:38,448 --> 00:29:41,660
The witness is speaking about
something unrelated to this case.

444
00:29:41,743 --> 00:29:43,662
-I know.
-[defense attorney] Your Honor.

445
00:29:44,996 --> 00:29:45,997
Counsel.

446
00:29:47,290 --> 00:29:48,959
Don't you know what kind of judge I am?

447
00:29:50,377 --> 00:29:52,754
If you talk back one more time,
you're out.

448
00:29:56,383 --> 00:29:57,467
Witness.

449
00:29:58,468 --> 00:29:59,719
Please continue.

450
00:30:02,055 --> 00:30:03,515
That day, 25 years ago,

451
00:30:05,475 --> 00:30:09,479
I was with the person
who murdered my family.

452
00:30:09,563 --> 00:30:10,856
[door thudding]

453
00:30:11,481 --> 00:30:13,400
-[breathing heavily]
-[banging on door]

454
00:30:18,029 --> 00:30:19,239
[Taegyu] Hey, kid.

455
00:30:20,490 --> 00:30:21,992
If you don't open the door,

456
00:30:22,701 --> 00:30:25,245
your mom, dad, and brother

457
00:30:26,329 --> 00:30:28,248
will all die.

458
00:30:30,792 --> 00:30:32,586
Will you let them die because of you?

459
00:30:32,669 --> 00:30:36,506
[Daon's mother] Daon. Don't open the door.

460
00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:38,550
Don't...

461
00:30:39,134 --> 00:30:40,260
Stay there.

462
00:30:41,595 --> 00:30:44,014
[continues weakly] Don't come out.

463
00:30:44,931 --> 00:30:45,932
-[Daon's mother groans]
-[soft thud]

464
00:30:48,643 --> 00:30:49,895
[Daon] <i>I wanted</i>

465
00:30:50,687 --> 00:30:52,856
to become an officer to catch him myself

466
00:30:53,982 --> 00:30:55,901
and make sure he's punished.

467
00:30:57,235 --> 00:31:00,614
Let me repeat myself.
This is unrelated to this case!

468
00:31:00,697 --> 00:31:02,073
Escort him out.

469
00:31:04,034 --> 00:31:06,286
[defense attorney] Your Honor,
why am I being thrown out?

470
00:31:06,369 --> 00:31:08,622
[yelling] I have the right
to defend my client!

471
00:31:08,705 --> 00:31:11,791
What kind of trial is this, Your Honor?
Your Honor!

472
00:31:14,127 --> 00:31:16,838
Your Honor!

473
00:31:17,797 --> 00:31:21,176
Is there anything more you'd like to say?

474
00:31:21,885 --> 00:31:24,888
Your Honor. Please show in this court

475
00:31:26,389 --> 00:31:28,391
that the world
may have forgotten about us,

476
00:31:28,475 --> 00:31:30,519
but the law has not abandoned us.

477
00:31:35,065 --> 00:31:37,692
It's only right
that a criminal must be punished.

478
00:31:39,569 --> 00:31:42,322
Let that be a reality, not a miracle.

479
00:31:42,405 --> 00:31:44,950
So we can break free from the past

480
00:31:45,033 --> 00:31:47,160
and live for tomorrow,

481
00:31:47,827 --> 00:31:49,287
I beg of you to please

482
00:31:51,206 --> 00:31:53,792
save us
from this bottomless pit of suffering.

483
00:31:53,875 --> 00:31:55,585
[people whispering]

484
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:11,434
You scared me.

485
00:32:11,518 --> 00:32:12,936
Aren't you hungry?

486
00:32:16,773 --> 00:32:18,525
Who said you could do that?

487
00:32:18,608 --> 00:32:20,652
[Mija] Friends share like this.

488
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:24,281
Why are we friends? Have you gone senile?

489
00:32:24,865 --> 00:32:27,492
Stop talking and just eat the damn burger.

490
00:32:27,576 --> 00:32:29,995
You haven't eaten all day
because of the trial.

491
00:32:36,585 --> 00:32:37,586
Damn it.

492
00:32:37,669 --> 00:32:39,462
Why is this so hard to open?

493
00:32:39,546 --> 00:32:41,464
Just eat without the damn ketchup.

494
00:32:45,343 --> 00:32:48,054
What are you looking at?
You open it, then.

495
00:32:48,138 --> 00:32:49,139
Here.

496
00:32:52,893 --> 00:32:56,146
Bael came to see me today
before the trial.

497
00:32:56,813 --> 00:32:57,814
And?

498
00:32:59,024 --> 00:33:00,609
Are you scared you might die?

499
00:33:02,569 --> 00:33:04,487
Did you tell Han Daon?

500
00:33:06,072 --> 00:33:07,699
What am I supposed to tell him?

501
00:33:07,782 --> 00:33:10,493
That I have to release Jeong Taegyu
if I want to live?

502
00:33:11,161 --> 00:33:13,205
And if I don't, I'll die a horrible death?

503
00:33:14,414 --> 00:33:17,417
[sighs] I can't burden him with that.

504
00:33:18,418 --> 00:33:22,297
As a friend,
can I offer some friendly advice?

505
00:33:23,048 --> 00:33:24,549
Let him go.

506
00:33:25,175 --> 00:33:29,846
Don't make things messier than they are.
Just do as you've done.

507
00:33:29,930 --> 00:33:31,389
Do you mean that?

508
00:33:31,473 --> 00:33:33,808
You said you'll die
if you don't let him go.

509
00:33:33,892 --> 00:33:34,935
What can you do?

510
00:33:36,645 --> 00:33:37,938
Then what about Han Daon?

511
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:42,108
And everyone else
who wanted him to be punished by law?

512
00:33:43,151 --> 00:33:45,237
They've suffered all their lives.

513
00:33:46,154 --> 00:33:48,365
But I'm supposed to
make it worse for them?

514
00:33:50,242 --> 00:33:53,036
I already told you what I think.

515
00:33:53,119 --> 00:33:54,329
It's up to you.

516
00:33:56,998 --> 00:33:58,416
Are you serious?

517
00:33:58,500 --> 00:33:59,834
[yells] Have you gone mad?

518
00:34:01,169 --> 00:34:02,879
Sit down. You're blocking the light.

519
00:34:05,006 --> 00:34:07,259
If you don't release Jeong Taegyu,
you'll die.

520
00:34:07,342 --> 00:34:10,011
Just wrap up the trial
and let that bastard go.

521
00:34:10,095 --> 00:34:12,472
I can't do that. I'm a judge.

522
00:34:12,556 --> 00:34:14,516
You're a demon first.

523
00:34:15,767 --> 00:34:17,394
The moment you lock Jeong Taegyu up,

524
00:34:17,978 --> 00:34:20,689
you'll no longer be a demon.
You won't survive.

525
00:34:20,772 --> 00:34:23,066
But if you release
Jeong Taegyu and kill him,

526
00:34:23,149 --> 00:34:26,486
you will go back to Hell
and be reinstated as a judge in Hell.

527
00:34:26,570 --> 00:34:27,904
There are many sinners

528
00:34:27,988 --> 00:34:30,907
waiting for you to hand out
your sentences there, too.

529
00:34:30,991 --> 00:34:32,868
Justitia. Detective Han

530
00:34:32,951 --> 00:34:36,788
suffered his whole life with the guilt
that his family died because of him.

531
00:34:36,872 --> 00:34:39,457
[loudly] If he finds out
that you died because of him,

532
00:34:39,541 --> 00:34:41,585
he won't be able to carry on.

533
00:34:41,668 --> 00:34:42,878
He's right.

534
00:34:42,961 --> 00:34:45,589
I read in a book that love is doing

535
00:34:45,672 --> 00:34:48,675
what makes the other person happy
and not what you want.

536
00:34:48,758 --> 00:34:49,926
[yells] You didn't read a book!

537
00:34:50,010 --> 00:34:51,052
[softly] Shut up, you ass.

538
00:34:51,136 --> 00:34:52,220
Either way, Justitia...

539
00:34:52,304 --> 00:34:54,472
Don't say anything to Han Daon.

540
00:34:55,098 --> 00:34:56,808
-I've warned you.
-[gasps]

541
00:34:59,144 --> 00:35:00,770
[Mando] Justitia.

542
00:35:02,772 --> 00:35:04,649
Don't let her go! Justitia!

543
00:35:04,733 --> 00:35:06,067
Justitia...

544
00:35:06,151 --> 00:35:07,485
-[buzzer beeps]
-[door closes]

545
00:35:10,405 --> 00:35:11,865
[footsteps approaching]

546
00:35:13,825 --> 00:35:14,826
[Judge Kang] Fire gazing?

547
00:35:17,662 --> 00:35:18,663
[Daon] Judge Kang.

548
00:35:20,415 --> 00:35:21,583
Have a seat.

549
00:35:30,592 --> 00:35:34,012
If I give Jeong Taegyu a light sentence,

550
00:35:34,095 --> 00:35:35,639
will you hate me?

551
00:35:36,598 --> 00:35:37,933
[sighs]

552
00:35:41,061 --> 00:35:43,897
You worked so hard to arrest him.
So if I let him go,

553
00:35:44,564 --> 00:35:46,024
I think you'd resent me.

554
00:35:47,901 --> 00:35:50,904
[Daon] When I didn't kill Jeong Taegyu
myself and arrested him,

555
00:35:51,988 --> 00:35:53,573
my role in the matter was over.

556
00:35:54,157 --> 00:35:57,202
It's up to the judge
to make a decision according to the law.

557
00:35:58,078 --> 00:35:59,496
I trust you.

558
00:35:59,579 --> 00:36:01,248
Promise me.

559
00:36:01,831 --> 00:36:04,376
That no matter how
I sentence Jeong Taegyu,

560
00:36:04,459 --> 00:36:06,920
you will not hate or resent me.

561
00:36:10,006 --> 00:36:12,634
But that if you end up hating me anyway,

562
00:36:13,218 --> 00:36:14,511
you'll forget me.

563
00:36:18,139 --> 00:36:19,224
I will not hate

564
00:36:19,975 --> 00:36:21,101
or forget you.

565
00:36:22,811 --> 00:36:25,856
The statute of limitations
on the J serial killings expired.

566
00:36:25,939 --> 00:36:30,026
So I know it'll be difficult to give him
a death sentence anyway.

567
00:36:30,110 --> 00:36:33,655
So don't worry about me,
and do what you have to.

568
00:36:33,738 --> 00:36:35,031
I'm really okay.

569
00:36:40,328 --> 00:36:43,456
You have to keep the promise
that you'll be okay.

570
00:36:45,208 --> 00:36:49,629
[chuckles] What?
Should we pinkie promise, then?

571
00:36:50,255 --> 00:36:51,339
[chuckles softly]

572
00:36:54,509 --> 00:36:55,510
[clears throat]

573
00:36:57,304 --> 00:36:59,806
{\an8}[reporter] While Judge Kang
has caused a stir

574
00:36:59,890 --> 00:37:01,641
{\an8}for allegedly verbally abusing

575

{\an8}the defendant's legal counsel
during the last hearing,

579
00:37:15,238 --> 00:37:17,782
[Myeongsuk] I didn't know
we were in the same boat.

580
00:37:19,743 --> 00:37:22,871
-You've grown into an amazing person.
-[chuckles softly]

581
00:37:24,039 --> 00:37:25,874
We should go inside now.

582
00:37:26,958 --> 00:37:27,959
Right.

583
00:37:31,421 --> 00:37:34,090
Your daughter is probably
too pregnant to come.

584
00:37:34,174 --> 00:37:36,092
I'm sure she'll call you
after the hearing.

585
00:37:36,176 --> 00:37:37,511
[Myeongsuk] Okay.

586
00:37:41,556 --> 00:37:42,682
[Jueun's husband] Mother!

587
00:37:46,269 --> 00:37:47,771
We're not late, are we?

588
00:37:47,854 --> 00:37:50,565
Oh, my. I know you're busy. Why did you...

589
00:37:53,944 --> 00:37:55,111
[Jueun] After the hearing,

590
00:37:55,904 --> 00:37:57,614
can you make <i>japchae</i> for me at home?

591
00:37:57,697 --> 00:38:00,075
I've craved and missed it a lot.

592
00:38:00,158 --> 00:38:01,701
Your <i>japchae.</i>

593
00:38:01,785 --> 00:38:02,786
Goodness.

594
00:38:11,169 --> 00:38:12,170
Let's go.

595
00:38:14,506 --> 00:38:15,507
[chuckles softly]

596
00:38:53,962 --> 00:38:54,963
[sighs]

597
00:39:04,931 --> 00:39:05,974
{\an8}JUDGE'S OATH

598
00:39:18,778 --> 00:39:20,614
[bailiff] All rise.

599
00:39:41,259 --> 00:39:43,053
Please be seated.

600
00:39:51,019 --> 00:39:53,021
Defendant, before the sentencing,

601
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:55,565
do you have any last words?

602
00:40:04,115 --> 00:40:05,534
I trust

603
00:40:06,201 --> 00:40:10,664
that you will make a wise decision,
Your Honor.

604
00:40:25,136 --> 00:40:30,267
The court will pronounce the verdict
on case number 2024GoHap615.

605
00:40:32,143 --> 00:40:33,562
The defendant, Jeong Taegyu,

606
00:40:33,645 --> 00:40:37,065
shot and killed Inspector Kim Soyeong,

607
00:40:37,148 --> 00:40:39,442
and brutally mutilated her body.

608
00:40:39,526 --> 00:40:41,069
The testimony of Jeong Seonho,

609
00:40:41,152 --> 00:40:43,864
who was present at the time of the murder,
is consistent,

610
00:40:43,947 --> 00:40:47,450
and the defendant's fingerprints
were found on the murder weapon.

611
00:40:47,951 --> 00:40:50,370
Considering these facts,

612
00:40:51,288 --> 00:40:54,457
it is indisputable
that the defendant committed the crime.

613
00:40:55,041 --> 00:40:58,128
Furthermore, blood of
the victims of the J serial killings

614
00:40:58,211 --> 00:41:02,215
committed 25 years ago was found
on the weapon used to kill Kim Soyeong.

615
00:41:02,799 --> 00:41:06,678
Video footage was also found
of the defendant killing the victims.

616
00:41:07,262 --> 00:41:08,638
However, for these crimes,

617
00:41:08,722 --> 00:41:12,475
the statute of limitations expired in 2014
without charges being filed.

618
00:41:13,476 --> 00:41:16,938
Thus, in this sentencing,
those crimes are not considered.

619
00:41:17,022 --> 00:41:20,817
The sentencing must be based on
the case involving Kim Soyeong alone.

620
00:41:21,943 --> 00:41:22,944
However,

621
00:41:24,779 --> 00:41:27,991
the victims' families filed a petition
calling for severe punishment

622
00:41:28,909 --> 00:41:30,660
for the defendant.

623
00:41:31,536 --> 00:41:34,247
The victims' families know very well

624
00:41:34,915 --> 00:41:37,792
that sentencing the defendant to death
will not bring back

625
00:41:38,877 --> 00:41:40,253
their loved ones.

626
00:41:40,921 --> 00:41:43,465
They do not want to be compensated
for time lost

627
00:41:43,548 --> 00:41:45,884
by sentencing the defendant to death.

628
00:41:46,468 --> 00:41:48,512
They only wish to heal their wounds.

629
00:41:49,095 --> 00:41:51,932
They just want to be assured that the law

630
00:41:52,015 --> 00:41:53,683
has not abandoned them.

631
00:41:54,851 --> 00:41:57,062
[voice breaks slightly] In the end,
what they truly want

632
00:41:57,646 --> 00:42:00,607
is to mourn the victims
who lost their lives wrongfully

633
00:42:01,358 --> 00:42:04,611
and to be consoled for the terrible years
they have endured since.

634
00:42:05,403 --> 00:42:06,988
Thus, this court

635
00:42:08,031 --> 00:42:11,493
shall base the sentence
on the single most important criterion.

636
00:42:12,077 --> 00:42:14,704
The law shall not forgive
the crimes that the victims

637
00:42:15,497 --> 00:42:17,207
and their families do not forgive.

638
00:42:18,625 --> 00:42:21,211
Taking all these circumstances
into consideration,

639
00:42:21,795 --> 00:42:24,172
the court sentences
the defendant as follows.

640
00:42:25,674 --> 00:42:29,678
I... hereby sentence
the defendant Jeong Taegyu

641
00:42:31,596 --> 00:42:33,098
to death.

642
00:42:33,890 --> 00:42:36,351

00:42:43,525 --> 00:42:46,027
Thank you, Your Honor!

[crying] Thank God.

653
00:43:46,755 --> 00:43:48,256

-[reporter 3] Here!
-[reporter 2] A comment, please!

661
00:44:19,371 --> 00:44:23,625
Did the serial killings
from 25 years ago influence this ruling?

662
00:44:23,708 --> 00:44:25,252
Article 50 of the Criminal Act.

663
00:44:25,335 --> 00:44:28,380
"A person who kills another
shall be punished by death

664
00:44:28,463 --> 00:44:30,298
or sentenced to five years to life."

665
00:44:30,382 --> 00:44:32,676
I have always ruled according to the law.

666
00:44:32,759 --> 00:44:34,261
As I have in this case.

667
00:44:35,595 --> 00:44:36,763

[clamoring continues]

670
00:44:48,358 --> 00:44:49,651
[Judge Kang] Did you wait long?

671
00:44:51,403 --> 00:44:53,196
The reporters were hounding me.

672
00:44:56,366 --> 00:44:57,367

673
00:45:06,001 --> 00:45:09,004
Can you come with me somewhere?

00:45:21,099 --> 00:45:22,559
It's all over now.

677
00:45:24,019 --> 00:45:26,730
[sighs] So forget about everything there

678
00:45:27,647 --> 00:45:28,899
and rest in peace.

679
00:45:30,609 --> 00:45:32,652
[tearfully] But I will never forget.

680
00:45:33,236 --> 00:45:35,238
Because when we meet again,

681
00:45:38,116 --> 00:45:40,243
[sniffles] I need to recognize you.

682
00:45:44,206 --> 00:45:45,248
Until then,

683
00:45:46,541 --> 00:45:48,084
I will be well here.

684
00:45:51,838 --> 00:45:53,840
You don't need to worry about me.

685
00:45:58,220 --> 00:45:59,721
[Daeyong] The defendant, Jeong Seonho,

686
00:45:59,804 --> 00:46:02,098
{\an8}attempted to assault victim Yoo Jeongim

687
00:46:02,182 --> 00:46:03,850
and confined and assaulted

688
00:46:03,934 --> 00:46:06,811
victim Kang Bitna before fleeing.

689
00:46:06,895 --> 00:46:11,358
Furthermore, he brandished a weapon
at victim Kim Soyeong.

690
00:46:11,441 --> 00:46:13,985
These offenses
should not be considered light.

691
00:46:14,653 --> 00:46:17,656
Thus, this court shall rule as follows.

692
00:46:17,739 --> 00:46:18,907
I hereby

693
00:46:18,990 --> 00:46:23,787
sentence the defendant, Jeong Seonho,
to 15 years' imprisonment.

694
00:46:24,538 --> 00:46:28,458
The court also grants the prosecution's
request for supervised treatment

695
00:46:28,542 --> 00:46:31,169
and orders the defendant
to complete 80 hours

696
00:46:31,253 --> 00:46:33,630
of drug rehabilitation
and treatment under custody.

{\an8}<i>the legal community
is harshly criticizing Judge Kang.</i>

708
00:47:31,146 --> 00:47:32,397
{\an8}<i>The defendant was</i>

709
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:36,401
{\an8}<i>practically punished for crimes
beyond the statute of limitations.</i>

710
00:47:36,484 --> 00:47:39,779
{\an8}<i>You could say it was
devoid of any common sense,</i>

711
00:47:39,863 --> 00:47:41,406
{\an8}<i>a very uneducated ruling,</i>

712
00:47:41,489 --> 00:47:45,702
{\an8}<i>fueled by the public's anger
and lack of legal understanding...</i>

713
00:47:45,785 --> 00:47:48,747
<i>Citizens, on the other hand,
are welcoming the ruling.</i>

714
00:47:48,830 --> 00:47:50,415
{\an8}<i>It was such a relief.</i>

715
00:47:50,498 --> 00:47:53,126
{\an8}<i>I hope there are
more rulings like this going forward.</i>

716

717
00:47:55,378 --> 00:47:56,463
{\an8}<i>Well,</i>

718
00:47:56,546 --> 00:47:59,257
{\an8}<i>I think the judges should look back
and ask themselves</i>

719
00:47:59,341 --> 00:48:01,301
<i>why people are going wild
over this ruling.</i>

720
00:48:10,644 --> 00:48:12,812

721
00:48:14,356 --> 00:48:16,483

-Yes, this is Na Yeongjin...
-[assemblyman] <i>Hey, Chief Judge.</i>

723
00:48:20,987 --> 00:48:22,531
<i>A death sentence?</i>

724
00:48:22,614 --> 00:48:26,034
<i>We clearly told you
to rule in favor of Jeong Taegyu.</i>

725
00:48:26,117 --> 00:48:28,203

726

[yelling] Damn you!

727
00:48:29,871 --> 00:48:31,581
I can't take this filth anymore.

728

[assemblyman] <i>Have you forgotten who I am?</i>

729
00:48:34,459 --> 00:48:36,378

730
00:48:36,461 --> 00:48:38,880
[yelling] You may be an assemblyman,
but I'm a judge!

731
00:48:38,964 --> 00:48:41,049
Goodbye! You take enough of our taxes!

732

He can't mess with me!

[laughs] I'm a judge!

736
00:48:52,227 --> 00:48:53,603
Hello, Judge Bitna.

737
00:48:53,687 --> 00:48:54,688
-You're the best!
-Best!

738
00:48:54,771 --> 00:48:55,897
[woman 1] It felt so good.

739
00:48:55,981 --> 00:48:57,983
-[woman 2] So satisfying.
-[man] You're so cool.

740
00:49:00,652 --> 00:49:02,779
[Hwaseon] Judge Kang, you're a star now.

741
00:49:03,363 --> 00:49:06,032
I know, right?
I might be asked to do a commercial.

742
00:49:06,116 --> 00:49:07,909
I don't think that will happen.

743
00:49:07,993 --> 00:49:10,620
The chief just dropped a bomb.

744
00:49:11,329 --> 00:49:12,414
What bomb?

745
00:49:14,875 --> 00:49:19,462
He exposed how Assemblyman Jeong Jaegeol
and other assembly members

746
00:49:19,546 --> 00:49:21,047
asked him to influence trials.

747
00:49:21,631 --> 00:49:23,300
You know, whistleblowing.

748
00:49:24,342 --> 00:49:25,385
Wow.

749
00:49:26,386 --> 00:49:28,054
TO SEE MORNING SUN
IN THE EVENING

750
00:49:28,138 --> 00:49:29,222
[Judge Kang] Why did you do it?

751
00:49:31,725 --> 00:49:35,228
Watching your trial this time,
I remembered

752
00:49:35,312 --> 00:49:36,938
that I was a judge, too.

753
00:49:37,522 --> 00:49:40,609
And I felt ashamed
of the things I've done.

754
00:49:41,359 --> 00:49:45,197
You know, that kind of introspection
doesn't suit your face.

755
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:46,656
Why you...

756
00:49:48,992 --> 00:49:50,785
When I became a judge,

757
00:49:51,494 --> 00:49:55,040
my mother and father were so proud of me.

758
00:49:55,624 --> 00:49:58,043
I've forgotten about that for too long.

759
00:49:58,126 --> 00:49:59,461
Wow.

760
00:49:59,544 --> 00:50:02,339
That's something
no one's interested to know.

761
00:50:02,422 --> 00:50:03,548
Right.

762
00:50:04,382 --> 00:50:06,259
I should have kept it to myself.

763
00:50:06,343 --> 00:50:08,303
But I forgot about it, too.

764
00:50:08,386 --> 00:50:11,723
Anyway, I feel bad
I've put you in a difficult position.

765
00:50:11,806 --> 00:50:13,141
It's karma, I guess.

766
00:50:13,225 --> 00:50:15,560
[Yeongjin] But the public
is happy with you,

767
00:50:15,644 --> 00:50:17,687
so they won't get rid of you so easily.

768
00:50:17,771 --> 00:50:20,857
You should lie low for a few years
by the coast and come back.

769
00:50:20,941 --> 00:50:23,527
And what are you going to do from now on?

770
00:50:23,610 --> 00:50:24,611
Me?

771
00:50:26,029 --> 00:50:27,239
I'll become a YouTuber.

772
00:50:27,822 --> 00:50:30,992
"Legal common sense from a former judge."

773
00:50:31,076 --> 00:50:33,286
"Bang, bang!" What do you think?

774
00:50:35,247 --> 00:50:37,332
SEOUL JUNGBU DETENTION CENTER

775
00:50:53,223 --> 00:50:54,599
My Yechan.

776
00:50:56,434 --> 00:50:57,519
Why did you kill him?

777
00:51:02,399 --> 00:51:04,234
He was an innocent kid.

778
00:51:05,986 --> 00:51:08,321
Why did you have to kill him so brutally?

779
00:51:08,405 --> 00:51:11,867
I already said all that in court.

780
00:51:13,952 --> 00:51:15,495
I'm curious about something, too.

781
00:51:16,580 --> 00:51:20,166
Why did you have kids when you were poor?

782
00:51:20,959 --> 00:51:22,294
And you had two.

783
00:51:22,377 --> 00:51:25,297
Think about it. A wealthy family...

784
00:51:26,298 --> 00:51:27,465
No.

785
00:51:28,091 --> 00:51:30,260
Even an average family would have

786
00:51:30,844 --> 00:51:33,805
provided a better home
than that dumpy neighborhood.

787
00:51:33,889 --> 00:51:37,309
Then he wouldn't have had to walk
through those alleys going to school

788
00:51:37,392 --> 00:51:39,144
and he never would've met me.

789
00:51:41,855 --> 00:51:43,857
Your son died

790
00:51:43,940 --> 00:51:46,401
because of you.

791
00:51:48,612 --> 00:51:51,031
-Apologize to my son.
-[chuckles]

792
00:51:52,782 --> 00:51:55,035
You don't seem to get it.

793
00:51:55,660 --> 00:51:57,412
It didn't take long.

794
00:51:57,495 --> 00:52:01,082
He was a minor, so I made sure

795
00:52:01,166 --> 00:52:02,959
to make it quick.

796
00:52:03,793 --> 00:52:07,339
It only took five stabs.

797
00:52:11,343 --> 00:52:12,344
Oh, right.

798
00:52:13,261 --> 00:52:14,304
At the end,

799
00:52:15,305 --> 00:52:16,848
the kid said...

800
00:52:20,268 --> 00:52:22,395
[mimicking Yechan] "Mister,

801
00:52:22,479 --> 00:52:25,065
please don't kill me."

802
00:52:25,148 --> 00:52:26,816
"If I die,

803
00:52:27,651 --> 00:52:31,154
my mom will be really sad."

804
00:52:32,864 --> 00:52:34,366
[in normal voice] And I told him,

805
00:52:35,283 --> 00:52:36,326
"No."

806
00:52:37,118 --> 00:52:38,537
"Your mom will be happy

807
00:52:39,162 --> 00:52:43,250
because there will be
one less mouth to feed."

808
00:52:44,709 --> 00:52:46,628
-And then...
-[gasps]

809
00:52:48,004 --> 00:52:49,005
[Myeongsuk crying] I...

810
00:52:49,798 --> 00:52:52,926
I will never forgive you.

811
00:52:53,927 --> 00:52:55,846
I've already been forgiven.

812
00:52:58,598 --> 00:52:59,641
You know that.

813
00:53:01,768 --> 00:53:02,769
Are you...

814
00:53:04,104 --> 00:53:05,438
Are you even human?

815
00:53:06,773 --> 00:53:07,983
[Taegyu] Damn it.

816
00:53:09,442 --> 00:53:12,821
You should thank me for saving your son.

817
00:53:12,904 --> 00:53:14,239
Just as I thought,

818
00:53:14,906 --> 00:53:17,784
you poor people are shameless.

819
00:53:18,618 --> 00:53:20,704
Die. [yells] You die, too!

820
00:53:20,787 --> 00:53:23,790
[Taegyu] That's too bad.
I think I'll live a long time.

821
00:53:24,374 --> 00:53:26,251
I'm not being executed.

822
00:53:27,419 --> 00:53:30,505
[softly] And they're feeding me well.

823
00:53:30,589 --> 00:53:32,299
[in normal voice] It's very nutritious.
