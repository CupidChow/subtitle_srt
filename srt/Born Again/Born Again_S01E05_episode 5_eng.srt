1
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:56,290
   

2
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:12,880


3
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:29,670
Not yet. Please start the inspection after the reporters arrive.

4
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:33,410
I'll have him judged by the media first.

5
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:44,690
Yes, Senior?

6
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:50,010
Senior, I told you today was my first lecture.

7
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:55,090
I got it. I told you I got it. After the lecture, I'll bring the Andong elder to you.

8
00:02:55,090 --> 00:03:01,170
 We don't have the elder's skull so the main part of the exhibition is missing right now! 

9
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:04,710
 In the worst-case scenario, you'll have to bring your skull.  

10
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,880
My skull...

11
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,590
Sir! Can you stop here? Please, just one second!

12
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:21,550
Thank you! Thank you!

13
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:23,660
 Do whatever I say! 

14
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:25,480
You talk too much!

15
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:28,990
I told you to give me money!

16
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:31,160
Switch grandma with me.

17
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,800
What are you? What kind of crazy bitch are you?

18
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:37,410
Don't you hear me? I said I'll switch!

19
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:46,180
Right, it's more worth it to kill you.

20
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:48,310
Who is that crazy bastard?

21
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:07,120
Heo Do Jin.  His current age is 34 years old.

22
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,620
At 15, school violence and motorcycle arson.

23
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:11,720
At 17, holdup robbery and injury.

24
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:14,720
At 19, attempted murder against a part-time worker at an internet cafe.

25
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:17,580
Total of seven previous convictions.

26
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:20,890
Why doesn't that bastard think of killing himself?

27
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:26,080
Come here.

28
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,470
I said come here!

29
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:31,770
Who-Who is he?  Is he a leech or a stalker?

30
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:35,740
Why does he keep following me around?!

31
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:53,020
- Grandma, are you all right? Oh my goodness.
- My back...

32
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:54,680
What do I do?

33
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:11,890
By the looks of her, she won't be able to live out her whole lifespan.

34
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,430
 Prosecutor, that bastard Byeon Seong Hoon... I don't think he's a serial killer. 

35
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:22,680
 No matter how much I dig, there's no evidence. 

36
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:26,750
That bastard killed his family friend when he was 13 by burying him alive.

37
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:31,480
He has a criminal's DNA running through his veins. That's the evidence.

38
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:34,710
Tell them to wait. I'm coming.

39
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:43,660
   

40
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:52,780
Prisoner number 373...

41
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:56,770
Even though death-row convict Kim Sa Yeon passed away,

42
00:05:56,770 --> 00:06:02,080
that man's heart is still beating inside of me.

43
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:08,760
 You seem really interested in corpses. 

44
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:12,990
What is this?

45
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,420
 Anyway, the class syllabus is just a formality. Just talk about postmortems. 

46
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:29,530
Can I really do that?

47
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:34,800
Professor, there's a student here who got an A+.

48
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,420
Something I was never able to get from you...

49
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:41,510
 He is the student who got the highest score for the comprehensive exams of basic medicine in the nation. 

50
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:44,960
 I want to keep him but do you think he'll stay in forensic medicine? 

51
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:48,040
 You'll probably spot who that kid is right away when you enter the lecture hall. 

52
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,970
 Cheon Jong Beom, 100, A+ 

53
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:58,980
 The point where archaeology and forensic medicine meet is bone archaeology. 

54
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:01,800
 Because bones are permanent evidence. 

55
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,980
Found at Valdaro, near Mantua in northern Italy,

56
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:08,160
These are the remains of lovers from 6,000 years ago.

57
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:13,140
Because of their healthy teeth, we can assume they were a man and a woman between the ages of 18 and 20.

58
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:16,960
Here. You can see that they died holding one another, right?

59
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:21,740
Dubbed "The Eternal Embrace," or "The Lovers of Valdaro."

60
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:26,080
   

61
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:37,020
Some believe that this was a lovers' suicide, based on their remains.

62
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:42,990
If that's true, you all could be looking at the world's oldest lovers.

63
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:45,500
Yes, over there.

64
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:48,120
What makes you so sure that the remains are lovers?

65
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,110
Then... what do you think they are?

66
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:52,200
They could have been buried after a murder.

67
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,060
There is no evidence of trauma on the remains.

68
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:57,330
If this happened 6,000 years ago, there would have been a custom of burying the living with the dead.

69
00:07:57,330 --> 00:08:03,510
Maybe a woman was forcefully buried alive and she felt cold so she endured by embracing the male corpse.

70
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:05,680
Then in the end, she froze to death. Could that be a possibility?

71
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,670
I'm not sure...

72
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:12,400
The truth may only be known to the dirt and bugs in the grave,

73
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,520
but they're facing one another, eye to eye.

74
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:19,420
Don't you think they were looking at each other until the moment they died?

75
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:21,790
That kind of thing is something you feel with your heart.

76
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:25,660
It's possible they looked at each other with hate until they died.

77
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:30,640
- Well... why? 
 -  What's wrong with him? 

78
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:33,900
It's just a scenario I made up.

79
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:39,900
The perspective of looking at bones and thinking of a murder case is good... for forensic medicine.

80
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:44,800
Okay. Then, should we stop here for today?

81
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,980
Oh right! If you're interested in the National Forensic Service, please apply.

82
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:49,900
 Yes, Ma'am. 

83
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,020
   

84
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:44,570
- You must like the sound of music boxes. 
- What?

85
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:52,250
I bought this for my niece, but your hair kept bothering me.

86
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:56,680
You were concerned about my hair and not the content of the lecture...

87
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,210
What poor behavior.

88
00:09:58,210 --> 00:10:01,100
Did you give the book to your friend?

89
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:07,270
 I finished reading it. 

90
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:09,290
Thanks to you.

91
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:17,850
I want to see a bone autopsy.

92
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:21,940
By chance... are you Cheon Jong Beom?

93
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:24,180
So you are!

94
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:28,960
To see a bone autopsy, you need to be qualified.  May I verify you?

95
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:31,470
- Verify? 
 - There's someone I want to introduce to you.

96
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:33,530
Will you come to the laboratory after lunch?

97
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:38,070
He's 300 years older than you, so make sure you mind your manners.

98
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,790
   

99
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:56,900
Professor!

100
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:59,820
Professor, Cheon Jong Beom's super good looking, right?

101
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:02,020
Cheon Jong Beom?

102
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:04,300
Over there!

103
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:08,500
Ta-da! A walking sculpture of David!

104
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:11,300
He's a second-year student at our medical school. But you know, right?

105
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:14,220
He was born with a DNA spoon, even better than a gold spoon. 
 (T/N: "gold spoon"—born into a rich family, top 1%) 

106
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:18,780
I don't think anyone has seen him without her heart beating out of her chest.

107
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:22,350
Even so, 4.3 million years ago, he was just an Ardipithecus specimen.

108
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:23,950
Ardi?

109
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:27,350
It had a chimpanzee-sized brain but a full bipedal gait.

110
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:31,900
If he had been such a male Ardi, the female Ardis must've fought by pulling each other's fur. Right?

111
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:35,350
His father is the chief prosecutor.  He is the strongest candidate for the next Attorney General.

112
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:38,500
I heard that his mother is our school foundation's director.

113
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:42,880
What would his 1%  secret be among such perfect conditions?

114
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,770
Professor, I heard that Cheon Jong Beom is a total psychopath.

115
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:51,680
They say he first killed when he was 15 years old.

116
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:20,800
Please come in!

117
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:32,950
What are you doing? Greet your elder.

118
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:34,880
Elder?

119
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,900
 Warm and strong arms. 

120
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,730
What is this? Is it déjà vu?

121
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:02,480
You seem comfortable. Have you been in these situations often?

122
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,460
Hey...

123
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:15,790
Sir, how does it feel to see the world after 300 years?

124
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:18,120
Do you recognize anything?

125
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:23,480
Hanyang  (Seoul)  has changed quite a bit. We still do have some palaces left.

126
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:26,180
When the weather gets warm, we should visit there together.

127
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:29,930
- 300 years ago... means he's from the Joseon dynasty? 
 - Yeah.

128
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:33,580
These are the remains of an elderly person from Andong.

129
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:39,640
Just because someone dies physiologically, it doesn't mean they are dead.

130
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:44,520
When all the people who remember the person have died,

131
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:48,080
that's when that person's truly dead.

132
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:52,190
I'm the type of person who thinks that if someone dies, they don't have dignity anymore.

133
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:55,390
Then... why are you so interested in remains?

134
00:13:55,390 --> 00:14:00,270
Because I agree with you. That bones are eternal evidence.

135
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:07,540
Flesh decays and blood dries, but bones live on.

136
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:12,780
They tell you without a word... how people were killed.

137
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:15,170
He just died of a disease.

138
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:18,610
Do you tend to approach everything from a forensic-medicine perspective?

139
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:21,570
My dream is to be a forensic scientist like you.

140
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:28,760
Senior...

141
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:32,920
 Listen carefully: right now, Mi o'clock (2–4:00 p.m.) is ending and Sin o'clock (4–6:00 p.m.) is about to start. 

142
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:36,160
 If you don't bring the Andong elder to the exhibition by 4:00 p.m., 

143
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:40,710
 you'll definitely die by my hand. 

144
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:44,830
Could you just wait until 6:00, Senior?

145
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:47,990
This sinner who deserves death has one more lecture.

146
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:50,130
 Hey! 

147
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:59,820
- If you're busy, shall I bring the elder to the destination? 
 - Huh?

148
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:03,170
I've run errands bringing remains when Professor Nam Yeong Goo did exhibitions.

149
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:05,270
Really?

150
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:09,810
This is the errand-running app I use as a part-timer.

151
00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:15,300
If you officially request a job, the price will start at ₩200,000  (about $164)  because it's a cultural treasure.

152
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:21,950
Because you're a professor whose class I take, I'll give you a discount.

153
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:24,950
₩200,000... Okay.

154
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:28,180
But if there are issues, you have to pay 5,000 times that much.

155
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:31,920
As you said, it's a cultural treasure.  Is it okay?

156
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:35,430
Then I should charge additionally for a vehicle. Please get me one.

157
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:39,900
Something luxurious and comfortable for the cultural treasure elder to ride in.

158
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:00,220
Give me your phone, please.

159
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:04,210
I'll decline. I don't exchange contact information with students.

160
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:11,710
I have to text you once the delivery has been made.

161
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:24,930
   

162
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:54,360
 [Forensic Medicine Professor Jeong Sa Bin 

163
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:59,060
   

164
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:01,090
   

165
00:17:13,890 --> 00:17:16,380
 Pulse... 

166
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:23,160
 A vibration that occurs for a short time. An electric current flowing for a very short period of time. 

167
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:27,950
 The thing I felt from that person... 

168
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:58,510
   

169
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:02,220
 Did you give your friend the book? 

170
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:04,270
 Thanks to you. 

171
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:16,550
 I felt a sharp pain. 

172
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:28,850
Please look over there, as well.

173
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,900
I already told you...

174
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:57,580
I really can't recall because I took psychiatric medicine.

175
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:59,800
- Let me speak with him alone. 
 - Of course.

176
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,610
Let's go.

177
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:23,130
Why? You can't remember if it was six or seven you killed because you got carried away with excitement?

178
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:27,080
That's good then. Once you eat it all up, all the corpses will show themselves.

179
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:34,510
I'll talk. I'll talk.

180
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:36,710
I remember.

181
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:40,790
Get up.

182
00:19:58,290 --> 00:20:00,110
Wait a minute.

183
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,630
What?

184
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:08,620
This isn't the place, though.

185
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:13,540
You might not know it, but your feet recognize it.

186
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:18,600
Dig with your hands.

187
00:20:26,170 --> 00:20:30,530
 Cheon Jong Beom is a total psychopath. They say he first killed when he was 15 years old. 

188
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:33,110
So that's why his father

189
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:37,730
sent him to the U.S. and to Taebaek Monastery and stuff.

190
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:42,220
Come closer. This is really important.

191
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:46,580
When he dates, he only dates women with surgery scars.

192
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:49,570
My friend Moon Sol Hee is the daughter of his family's driver.

193
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:55,700
And the reason they dated was because of her scar from a lymph node surgery.

194
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:57,820
I just wasted my life...

195
00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:01,930
The only surgery I ever got was hemorrhoid surgery!

196
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:04,070
Gross.

197
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,880
Give it to me!

198
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,870
Give me the cola.

199
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:45,780
"Eyes, look your last!

200
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:48,750
Arms, take your last embrace!

201
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:52,260
And, lips, oh you the doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss

202
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:55,880
a dateless bargain to engrossing death."

203
00:21:57,630 --> 00:22:01,470
Shakespeare quotes on a forensic medicine book...

204
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:04,490
What is this?  Is it a stream of consciousness?

205
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:31,710
 At the exhibition hall. Brought Andong elder. Please deposit my fee. 

206
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:42,890
   

207
00:22:42,890 --> 00:22:45,530
   

208
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:51,550
   

209
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:56,960
   

210
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,170
   

211
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:03,040
Mr. Psychopath is all about money.

212
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:05,990
- Yes? 
 - Where are you?

213
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:08,110
The police excavation team called.

214
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:10,110
 Can you come with me to Gangwon Province? 

215
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:13,630
Remains were found near Donggang.

216
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:17,180
Remains are making their appearance on such a warm spring day.

217
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:20,840
I'm heading there straight from the office. How will you get there?

218
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:23,260
I'll take the train.

219
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:52,350
March 5, 2020. Day 1021 of the bone autopsy.

220
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:56,380
I'm going to the excavation spot.

221
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:59,530
I hope that the remains I get to meet today

222
00:24:59,530 --> 00:25:02,730
will tell me everything

223
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:05,560
he or she couldn't say all these years while buried.

224
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:10,560
Everyone has a fateful time...

225
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:15,120
When that fateful time comes, someone will find me,

226
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:19,320
and I will find that other person.

227
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:26,520
   

228
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,370
This dead corpse was treated with formaldehyde in the drum.

229
00:25:56,370 --> 00:26:01,230
There might be some decay effects in water, but the body is not decayed at all.

230
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:05,100
Only the head becoming a skull is a very interesting characteristic,

231
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:07,450
and being wrapped in red rope, too...

232
00:26:07,450 --> 00:26:09,740
And the head is severely broken.

233
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:12,620
The upper part of the skull and the jawbone are still intact.

234
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:44,350
Judging by the look of the wisdom teeth, this person was probably in his mid to late 20's...

235
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:46,790
And the sex is male...

236
00:26:46,790 --> 00:26:49,320
A physically fit and sturdy man.

237
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:54,530
Seeing how much the skull has decayed, it's over 30 years old.

238
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:01,640
"Wuthering Heights?"

239
00:27:04,430 --> 00:27:07,680
The letters from the book are all gone.

240
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:14,280
I don't even know what Wuthering Heights is.

241
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,000
Please just kill me.

242
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,110
If I killed them, my mother is a murderer.

243
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:30,100
I'm sure you got your filthy genes from your mother.

244
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:37,340
There are lots of reporters, so try posing if you want.

245
00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:42,840
- Take him to the reporters. 
- Yes, Sir.

246
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:48,040
I didn't do it!

247
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:49,330
 What was the motive for the murder?! 

248
00:27:49,330 --> 00:27:50,740
 By chance, are there any other victims? 

249
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:52,290
 Do you feel sorry for the victim? 

250
00:27:52,290 --> 00:27:54,340
I said I didn't do it!

251
00:27:57,310 --> 00:28:02,200
He was stabbed multiple times with a knife. The wounds are deep.

252
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:07,820
Since the face was mercilessly mutilated, the murderer was trying to make sure to hide the victim's identity.

253
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:09,650
A murder because of a love affair?

254
00:28:09,650 --> 00:28:11,450
I don't think that's the case here.

255
00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:16,570
Binding the dead with red rope and burying is a type of burial custom.

256
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:20,020
They could have been conducting a funeral.

257
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:22,730
This is Professor of Bone Archaeology Jeong Sa Bin, who specializes in bone autopsies.

258
00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:28,280
And this is Prosecutor Kim Soo Hyeok of Seoul Central Prosecutors' Office from the police excavation team.

259
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:34,940
That fist isn't going to open. Professor Yoo already tried earlier.

260
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:58,610
What is that? A ring?

261
00:28:58,610 --> 00:29:02,070
It looks like a wedding ring.

262
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:05,860
Oh! There are numbers on it. It looks like a date.

263
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:14,710
83-04-03.

264
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:16,390
83-04-03...

265
00:29:16,390 --> 00:29:18,760
Is it the wedding date?

266
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:20,740
April 3, 1983.

267
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:23,210
It could also be the first day they met.

268
00:29:23,210 --> 00:29:26,930
It could be a special souvenir as well.

269
00:29:32,530 --> 00:29:35,390
Let's listen to an opinion of a closer examination. As soon as possible.

270
00:29:35,390 --> 00:29:38,810
When the police investigation is over, please send the evidence to the National Forensic Service.

271
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:43,660
The murderer buried the victim naked so we can't identify him.

272
00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:52,170
If it's a 30-year old corpse, it's not the girl who Byeon Sang Hoon murdered...

273
00:29:52,170 --> 00:29:56,680
Prosecutor, the remains are from a victim who would've died when Byeon Sang Hoon was eight years old.

274
00:29:56,680 --> 00:30:00,890
Byeon Sang Hoon did kill this person, and this book never existed.

275
00:30:00,890 --> 00:30:05,250
If you think about it, there's no evidence that he didn't kill this person either.

276
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:09,740
This. These bones are evidence. Eternal evidence.

277
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:12,910
Professor Yoo, please move this corpse,

278
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:16,290
We will.

279
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:21,490
His face smells of formaldehyde.

280
00:30:24,150 --> 00:30:29,950
