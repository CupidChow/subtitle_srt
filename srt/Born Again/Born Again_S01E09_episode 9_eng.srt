 Timing and Subtitles by the Reborn Team @ viki 

2
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:43,900
   

3
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:06,210
119

4
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:09,240
Someone has been hurt. Please come quickly.

5
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:13,280
Boss, I was trying to kill just the passenger,

6
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,730
but Kim Soo Hyeok got hurt instead.

7
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:18,340
- Who's the passenger? 
 - It's a woman.

8
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:20,300
Instead of the woman,

9
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:23,180
Kim Soo Hyeok?

10
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:40,840
Thankfully, the CT scan shows there's no damage to his head.

11
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:44,750
Seeing the severity of the accident, you could say the heavens helped that he was only injured this much.

12
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:47,480
When will he regain consciousness?

13
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,540
- Are you family? 
 - No.

14
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:51,870
- Then are you his girlfriend? 
 - No, I'm not.

15
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:57,020
In an accident like this, the passenger is usually severely injured or dies.

16
00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:02,190
Turning the steering wheel knowing the driver's side would take the hit...

17
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:04,870
If the passenger is neither family or girlfriend,

18
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:09,530
it makes me wonder what instinct he had to overcome his survival instinct.

19
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:38,420
   

20
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:47,600
This is my first time holding a funeral for an abandoned dog.

21
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:51,940
I'm worried that this area is zoned for redevelopment. They wouldn't demolish the cathedral, right?

22
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:56,750
No one has even touched the soil in this area for the past 35 years.

23
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:17,080
From now on,

24
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:20,670
it won't be abandoned anymore.

25
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:22,540
By anyone.

26
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,480
 I brought it because it got run over by a car. It's a dog. 

27
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,260
 What? 

28
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:44,720
 Why would you bring it here? Let's take it to the vet right away. 

29
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:49,730
 It died without any sins just like Jesus. 

30
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:52,350
 It will come back to life in three days. 

31
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:57,450
 This dog isn't dead but dying. 

32
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:09,040
 You don't want it to survive? 

33
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,710
 Instead of dying after being abandoned, 

34
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:16,450
 it'll be happier if it's reborn. 

35
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:29,290
In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, we pray.

36
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:34,820
You always come to me even though you don't believe in God.

37
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:37,660
I'll get going.

38
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:41,260
Wait a minute.

39
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:47,590
I thought of you on my way back from the retreat, so I bought this for you.

40
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:50,640
Are you still collecting meteorites?

41
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:06,370
Thank you, Father.

42
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,000
Jong Beom!

43
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:18,300
If you want to suppress your instinct at a decisive moment,

44
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:21,760
make the subject wear something of yours that you like.

45
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:24,320
Somewhere where you can see it.

46
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:36,170
 Patient Kim Soo Hyeok's guardian! 

47
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:50,820
Oh.

48
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:53,510
How do you feel? Are you okay?

49
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:58,260
Can I ask why you did that?

50
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:02,350
You nearly died. You almost died trying to save me.

51
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:07,690
You don't need to feel burdened. I would have done the same for anyone else.

52
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:12,040
Oh, let me see. Your eyes might have been hurt from the accident.

53
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:15,540
- I'm fine, so just let meâ€” 
 - Hold still.

54
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:26,460
You only deal with the dead. How can you tell what's wrong?

55
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:28,780
There's no need to concern yourself. It's from the shock.

56
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:31,180
Is it just your left eye or both?

57
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:34,290
This won't make me give up on the remains.

58
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:38,270
But you will come with me to the Old Future Book Store, right?

59
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:42,180
- What? 
 - Your eyes wouldn't hurt if you were kinder.

60
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:44,310
Try blinking.

61
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:47,300
Come on, try blinking.

62
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:08,400
I've wanted to ask you since the beginning.

63
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,010
Why you look at me that way.

64
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:14,130
Look at you how?

65
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:15,670
As though...

66
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,950
I'm your lover you parted with.

67
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:24,000
What did you say?

68
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Don't look at just anyone like that. It'll create a misunderstanding.

69
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:38,910
Oh, yes. Team Leader.

70
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:57,880
No, Team Leader. The truck just veered in.

71
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:03,690
I'm okay, but Prosecutor Kim got hurt.

72
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:09,390
Yes. Oh, I have a lecture tomorrow at Seoyeon. I'll come to the NFS when I'm done.

73
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:12,320
I'm really okay. Yes.

74
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:32,780
Prosecutor Kim?

75
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:36,510
You need complete rest! If you come out already...

76
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:43,650
What if you get a scar on that perfect face of yours?

77
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:48,820
- It's really nothing. 
 - The guy who did this to you turned himself in right after the accident.

78
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:52,960
- Turned himself in? 
 - I looked into it since something didn't seem right.

79
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:56,180
He worked for Seo Tae Ha. You know him, don't you?

80
00:08:56,180 --> 00:09:01,600
The head of the Kennedy gang? The gang that has ties to the legal, the financial, and the religious sectors?

81
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:06,540
I also looked into Byeon Seong Hoon. He received several payments from Seo Tae Ha.

82
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:11,510
- So where is he right now? 
 - Seo Tae Ha is locked up at West Prison.

83
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:14,870
He and Byeon Seong Hoon teamed up there then.

84
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:17,750
Seo Tae Ha may be young,

85
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:21,980
but Soowon, Pyeongtaek, and Anyang, he merged five different gangs into one.

86
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:26,040
He's a scary bastard. But...

87
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:30,010
if Seo Tae Ha is working with Byeon Seong Hoon,

88
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:33,050
that makes everything more difficult.

89
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:35,440
Shouldn't we be scouring the whole country

90
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:39,410
to find the remains of those Byeon Seong Hoon killed?

91
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:43,290
Detective Joon, please pursue Cheon Eun Woo, I mean, Cheon Jong Beom.

92
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:47,420
Report his every move to me.

93
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:01,180
   
   

94
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:03,560
 To the highest point? 

95
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,760
I have a present for you.

96
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:58,590
I'm going to leave the painting I bought from you here.

97
00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:01,420
I didn't think you'd still have it.

98
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:05,850
I took care of a genius painter many years ago

99
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:09,960
and this is where he lived.

100
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,870
It gets really cold. Will you be okay?

101
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:15,490
Thank you. I'll pay the rent on time.

102
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:18,030
When will you move in?

103
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:19,510
Soon.

104
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:40,350
   

105
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:47,000
This angle is very refreshing.

106
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,230
It's as if you painted it looking down like God from above.

107
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:53,170
It wasn't intentional. God?

108
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:58,800
But this expression, how could it be so vivid?

109
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,720
As if she was right in front of you when you painted her.

110
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:06,010
It looks like someone was standing in front of the woman.

111
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:15,050
I'd like to repaint the walls.

112
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:17,100
Will that be okay?

113
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:19,080
Feel free.

114
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:41,030
You liked meteorites, too, didn't you?

115
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:45,210
Yes.

116
00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:57,830
We don't know where the meteorite falls from or how,

117
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:02,700
but someone will discover it.

118
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:06,560
I'll be going.

119
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:29,930
 When the face blooms on the dried-up bones, it excites me. 

120
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:43,640
   

121
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:55,550
   

122
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,120
You saw them prepare everything yourself?

123
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,530
Of course, ma'am.

124
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:13,260
Canadian harp seal

125
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:16,490
combined with wild ginseng, loach, sea cucumber, and gastrodia elata,

126
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:18,980
it's been boiled down for two whole days.

127
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:34,850
You're putting all of it in?

128
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:41,350
Won't it be too bitter?

129
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:58,310
Is that for Brother?

130
00:14:58,310 --> 00:15:00,060
The color's different.

131
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:04,960
It's a drink made from a seal. It has a lot of DHA so it's good for the brain.

132
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:08,080
While I'm visiting your grandfather in the U.S.,

133
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:11,030
you have to make this drink for your brother.

134
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:14,290
I've done it all along.

135
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:16,410
You know he's the pride and joy of our family, don't you?

136
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:17,460
Of course, yes.

137
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:21,020
Here. Drink this one. It's not bitter.

138
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:35,160
Are you traveling somewhere?

139
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,210
What is it?

140
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:39,020
Mom said to make sure you drink this all up.

141
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:41,070
It's really expensive.

142
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:46,830
Give it to me. I'll drink it.

143
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:28,490
Prosecutor, but how are you so sure that Cheon Jong Beom is the real culprit?

144
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:32,210
A person who holds the memories of a murder will kill again.

145
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:34,510
He committed his first murder at age 15.

146
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:36,650
He's been resisting it for a long time already.

147
00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:38,920
Please keep observing him closely.

148
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:56,570
It's Cheon Jong Beom's family registry.

149
00:16:56,570 --> 00:17:00,930
I've confirmed that Chief Prosecutor Cheon Seok Tae and Seoyeong Foundation Director Heo Jin Gyeong

150
00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:02,720
are his parents.

151
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,460
 Cheon Seok Tae, Heo Jin Gyeong 

152
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:39,550
Three days.

153
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:43,480
Spending three days with a dead body...

154
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:51,880
Why didn't you come to the office? How do you feel?

155
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,030
Sorry for making you worry.

156
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:54,990
Nonsense.

157
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:58,670
Oh, do you have a suspect in the Im Hwa Yeong case?

158
00:17:58,670 --> 00:18:01,090
We have one prime suspect, Chief Prosecutor.

159
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:02,670
Who is it?

160
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,950
I said, who is it?

161
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:11,630
Your son, Cheon Jong Beom, is the suspect in this case.

162
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:15,110
What? Jong Beom?

163
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:17,710
The last person who saw the murdered Im Hwa Yeong

164
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:20,760
was Cheon Jon Beom, the part-timer.

165
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:25,710
And he's the only one who went to her house around the time of the murder.

166
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:29,110
We also have a statement from a witness.

167
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,300
There's no way...

168
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:36,220
You talk often about Jong Woo but never once about Cheon Jong Beom,

169
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:38,340
so I nearly misunderstood you.

170
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:39,690
How much do you know?

171
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:43,600
I made sure the situation is undisclosed.

172
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,840
It will be switched to a private investigation.

173
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:06,880
   

174
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:28,930
   

175
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:38,140
It's your fault. I told you to live as if you were dead.

176
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:41,890
Dad, I want to live with him.

177
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:45,910
Why? He can't live with us?

178
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:48,650
Did he do something wrong again?

179
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:50,650
You're an adult now.

180
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:53,170
Let's not cause each other discomfort anymore.

181
00:19:53,170 --> 00:19:55,080
Leave before your mom comes back from the States.

182
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,220
Dad.

183
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,430
Let's talk in the library.

184
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:10,510
Moron.

185
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:18,310
Did you kill Im Hwa Yeong?

186
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:22,140
- Answer me. 
 - Do you even want to hear my answer?

187
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:30,020
This is... exactly why I dislike you.

188
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:34,560
Your eyes want to look into a human being.

189
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:40,780
It gives me chills and makes me uncomfortable. You were the same when you were 15.

190
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:47,700
Instead of telling whether you killed or not, you always looked at me like that.

191
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,880
Are you talking about that day?

192
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:57,950
How did you look at me when I was 15?

193
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:02,090
You only asked whether I killed or not.

194
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,930
That's all you were curious about.

195
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,460
Keep your distance from Jong Woo.

196
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:20,280
I won't leave Korea.

197
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:27,010
But I'll live quietly out of your sight.

198
00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:29,260
Don't worry.

199
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:35,940
Thank you for raising me.

200
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:48,290
I don't remember well, but in this house,

201
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:52,510
there were probably happy moments, too.

202
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,840
He's similar...

203
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:18,530
He's not taking a trip.

204
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:22,740
Is he running away?

205
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:24,930
   

206
00:23:24,930 --> 00:23:26,210
Hello?

207
00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:28,120
 Is this Detective Joo In Do? 

208
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:29,290
Yes, who's calling?

209
00:23:29,290 --> 00:23:35,280
 I'm Im Hwa Yeong's next-door neighbor at Pureun Studio Apartments. You gave me your number. 

210
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:38,310
 - You told me to call if I remembered anything.  
 - Oh!

211
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:42,590
The lady who was dying of pain from the dimple surgery?

212
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:46,260
Did you remember something?

213
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:50,660
When I thought about it, I think it was around one in the morning.

214
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:51,610
One in the morning?

215
00:23:51,610 --> 00:23:54,880
I thought he had the wrong apartment at first.

216
00:23:57,180 --> 00:24:00,280
I saw his hands but not his face.

217
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,580
 Who is it? 

218
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:05,690
 I figured it was some crazy guy who followed me from a store pulling a prank. 

219
00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:08,650
 But when I thought back to it, it terrified me. 

220
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:11,230
 - If she died after that... 
 - What's that? 

221
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:13,240
 He could have been the culprit. 

222
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:15,270
 What a lunatic. 

223
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:20,470
Foreshadowing the murder by wearing baby socks on his fingers. What a psychopath.

224
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:27,580
 Maybe she made it up to lure the guy, but she was spewing nonsense. 

225
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:32,950
 My goodness, she was talking about killing her own baby that was a month old with a pillow! 

226
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:36,020
 But even a baby that young has a will to survive 

227
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:39,980
 and wouldn't die in one try. What horror! 

228
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:41,030
Prosecutor?

229
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:44,150
That's the reason Cheon Jong Beom went and visited Im Hwa Yeong.

230
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:46,120
What's that reason?

231
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:48,470
Baby socks...

232
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:50,520
What? What about it?

233
00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:55,830
   

234
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:09,210
You've never called me this late. What's going on?

235
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:13,320
Cheon Jong Beom... exclude him from the suspect list.

236
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:17,520
On the day of the murder, he was with me.

237
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:29,290
Do you want to see the reporters attack us like a pack of rabid dogs?

238
00:25:29,290 --> 00:25:32,400
Is that what you want?

239
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,480
I apologize.

240
00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:39,920
I told you you were my man.

241
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,790
Yes.

242
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:47,230
- Soo Hyeok. 
 - Yes, Sir.

243
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:52,290
I know your foul temper, but don't make it personal.

244
00:25:52,290 --> 00:25:56,140
Don't even take an ounce of interest in my son.

245
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:59,950
Going after my son is the same as going after my weakness.

246
00:25:59,950 --> 00:26:04,690
There's that thing you're good at. Let's just quickly cover it with that.

247
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:08,960
Invent a suspect for this case and lock him up.

248
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,120
Can't you do it?

249
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,250
It's not that.

250
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:21,710
The reason I liked you from the moment I saw you was because of your cool-headed equanimity.

251
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:27,670
You were rational even when you beat someone up,

252
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:31,920
and you didn't bat an eye when an unsurpassed beauty came after you.

253
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:37,490
And when someone came to you with millions, any money that didn't belong in your big picture, you spat on it.

254
00:26:37,490 --> 00:26:41,310
I know well that you're brutal but passionate.

255
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:46,500
I'm in that big picture of yours, aren't I?

256
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:53,430
Then don't ruin your big picture over your petty feelings.

257
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:30,760
Petty feelings?

258
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:50,180
Im Hwa Yeong,

259
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:53,960
baby socks,

260
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:59,580
biological mother, newborn baby,

261
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:03,340
abandonment of body after murder,

262
00:28:05,770 --> 00:28:09,110
Cheon Jong Beom,

263
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:11,230
three days,

264
00:28:12,050 --> 00:28:15,470
living with corpse,

265
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:17,760
cross...

266
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:32,020
Gong Ji Cheol's...

267
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:34,360
signature.

268
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:50,830
    

269
00:29:04,170 --> 00:29:06,770
   

270
00:29:06,770 --> 00:29:12,560
 Don't ruin your big picture over your petty feelings. 

271
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:48,910
