1
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:05,840
   

2
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:15,780
We're here.

3
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:18,960
Right.

4
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:24,250
Tonight, the road coming here felt so short.

5
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:28,840
Oh, by the way, the street lamps from before have all been fixed.

6
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:30,980
I know.

7
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:37,590
But... why did you come to see my dad tonight?

8
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:43,290
Oh... to be honest, I went because of Gong Ji Cheol, too.

9
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:45,430
Pardon? Why?

10
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:47,650
Because of the investigation.

11
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:54,300
Since he was the guard in charge, I thought he might know something about Gong Ji Cheol.

12
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:58,300
Don't worry too much.

13
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:04,350
Now your dad knows that Gong Ji Cheol is dead, too, so I'm sure he'll get better.

14
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:08,100
Do you... really think so?

15
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:14,660
But Gong Ji Cheol, why was he discovered by the water when he was executed?

16
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:19,550
Jeong Sa Bin, don't worry about things like that anymore.

17
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:23,090
I'll take care of that.

18
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:27,650
Go in then.

19
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:32,040
Okay. Then get home safe.

20
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:36,990
Jeong Sa Bin.

21
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:44,920
We'll... be able to see each other again, right?

22
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:49,800
Why do you sound like someone who's going away?

23
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:55,110
Good night.

24
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:19,770
Recorder. Recorder!

25
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:03,760
Hyungnim, I brought proof of Kim Soo Hyeok's crime fabrications.

26
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:13,430
You're saying this is proof to catch that bastard, huh?

27
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:15,190
Yes, Sir.

28
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:23,820
     

29
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:41,730
He made up crimes for others when he locked up my brother.

30
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:45,970
Kim Soo Hyeok really is a useless bastard.

31
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:58,350
   

32
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:02,210
Ji Cheol.

33
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:05,480
Finally, the first act of revenge has begun.

34
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:11,350
It's evidence that Kim Soo Hyeok used the remains all this time to send poor ex-convicts to jail.

35
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:15,270
It's now time for Kim Soo Hyeok to go to his grave.

36
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:17,170
I told you I needed him.

37
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:18,500
Need?

38
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:21,680
We're taking revenge on him. We don't need him.

39
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,200
Then it must be different from my revenge.

40
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:29,930
When it's time to kill Kim Soo Hyeok, I'll take the bullet out of my head and make him a murdering prosecutor.

41
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:33,670
That's not what's important to me right now.

42
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:37,980
That's funny.

43
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:43,860
Do educated people like you take the people who tried to kill you and use them when needed?

44
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:45,940
You do?

45
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:49,770
I have an empty head,

46
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:53,680
so I have to kill people who killed my brother and my people with my own hands.

47
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,960
If I tell you not to, don't do it.

48
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:03,650
It's too late. I already sent the file to Jang Hye Mi.

49
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:07,330
Prosecutor Kim's finished.

50
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:08,930
What?

51
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:22,790
Madam, as you said, the password was the same. And you left a big present for me, too.

52
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:27,020
Of course. Think of it as a reward for helping the chairman all these years.

53
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:31,190
Then what should I help you with now? The present was bigger than you promised.

54
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:34,470
I just want one thing.

55
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:38,860
Please make sure Prosecutor Kim Soo Hyeok can't act up anymore.

56
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:40,540
He's causing too much hassle.

57
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:42,750
I understand.

58
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:06,420
It's been a while, Dad.

59
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:08,710
You don't look so well.

60
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:11,110
I'll get out soon.

61
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:14,030
But there are some good things about being in here.

62
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:17,040
I have more time to think.

63
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:26,650
I found a way to take care of all three by killing one.

64
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:30,710
You are my daughter after all.

65
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:33,080
That woman...

66
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:42,610
You really do get me!

67
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:49,080
If that woman dies, then the man who loves her

68
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,470
and the man who protects her,

69
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:55,090
will both die even without me killing them.

70
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:59,180
With the pain of a burning heart...

71
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:02,240
very slowly...

72
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:10,170
Please take care of it, Dad.

73
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:17,370
   

74
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:03,490
 Can you stop by Body Heat on your way out? 

75
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:05,470
 Is something wrong? 

76
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,450
 I have something to tell you. 

77
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,520
Sa Bin!

78
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,940
What's the matter? What's wrong?

79
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:24,580
You stockings or whatever!

80
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:26,690
How dare you scooters trail her!

81
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:29,310
Just wait till I catch you!

82
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:34,690
I'll cut your legs off with my knife!

83
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:38,530
Just keep your mouth shut if you're stupid. It's a stalker, not scooter!

84
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:40,640
Sa Bin, I'll protect you.

85
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,740
Trust in your uncle!

86
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:44,550
I will protect you!

87
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:46,410
What do you mean a stalker?

88
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:50,430
I can't tell you right now, but you're in danger.

89
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:52,080
I think you'll be safe staying here for now.

90
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,720
Right, right.

91
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:56,200
Jong Beom is family.

92
00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:00,510
So if he says you're in danger, you're really in danger.

93
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:05,140
Never mind. I have so much work to do! Get away!

94
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:08,270
Trust in your uncle!

95
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,640
   

96
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,490
 I haven't come in a while, 

97
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:55,850
 and Mr. Jeong Seong Eun's condition isn't good. 

98
00:09:55,850 --> 00:09:59,340
 Could you come to the nursing hospital right now? 

99
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:03,000
Good going so early in the morning.

100
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,180
What do they mean "protect me"?

101
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:10,350
I'll protect you.

102
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:28,770
What's the matter?

103
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:33,220
Nurse, is my dad okay? You said his condition wasn't good.

104
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:38,420
Not at all. Since you left, he's been stable.

105
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:41,230
So I didn't contact you again.

106
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:42,260
Really?

107
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:47,090
Ever since you said he was okay, I've been feeling relieved, actually.

108
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:50,090
Ms. Han Yi Ji contacted me and...

109
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:52,830
If something happens, I'll call you right away.

110
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:55,210
Okay, thank you.

111
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:09,410
Miss, can you help me?

112
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:11,440
Yes, Sir. Are you not well?

113
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,420
I feel a little stifled, so I want to go outside,

114
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:21,290
but it's too hard to... walk alone.

115
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:23,750
Okay. I'll go with you.

116
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,510
Let's go.

117
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,910
Thank you.

118
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:44,230
Thanks to you, I feel like I can finally breathe.

119
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:46,580
Don't mention it.

120
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:56,140
It gets cold here at night, so don't stay out too late.

121
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:59,770
It'll become dark when night falls, won't it?

122
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:04,820
The darkness seems like a good friend.

123
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:08,770
It covers up everything.

124
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:15,490
Sins, tears, mountains, and even death.

125
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:22,590
I'm so grateful to you

126
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:26,180
that I want to give you a small gift.

127
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:27,930
Not at all.

128
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:30,000
Just a second.

129
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:12,400
How did you...

130
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,340
How...

131
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:18,150
Damn it.

132
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:20,090
What did you do to her?

133
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:23,430
She's just sleeping.

134
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:29,290
I just wanted to give my daughter Baek Sang Ah a proper gift.

135
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:37,260
Gift? You're just enjoying the killing.

136
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:39,400
Just like the likes of me.

137
00:14:54,950 --> 00:15:00,310
Go-Go-Gong Ji Cheol!

138
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:02,160
Mister.

139
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:05,950
Sorry, I'm sorry.

140
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:08,010
I'm sorry, Gong Ji Cheol.

141
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:09,840
I did wrong.

142
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:14,060
Prosecutor Cheon told me to keep my mouth shut or else.

143
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:20,540
That's why I did that. Really, I didn't know he would kill you.

144
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:27,900
I think there's a misunderstanding.

145
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:31,590
I'm not Gong Ji Cheol.

146
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:36,990
I'm Cheon Jong Beom.

147
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:45,130
I'm someone who... loves Jeong Sa Bin.

148
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:04,550
You can kill me, but please, not my Sa Bin.

149
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:10,940
Not Sa Bin, please. You can kill me.

150
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:13,670
Please, my Sa Bin...

151
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:39,740
Dad said it was Gong Ji Cheol, but since he was deemed unidentifiable,

152
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:42,120
there was no way to confirm his identity.

153
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,510
    
  

154
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:48,710
I looked into his family, too, but I couldn't find them.

155
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:50,730
It's okay.

156
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:54,500
He'll understand.

157
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:59,400
Just because you look alike, it seems like you feel the same.

158
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:03,330
Do you understand how he feels?

159
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,650
Probably.

160
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:16,910
All this time, I've directed all my hate at Gong Ji Cheol.

161
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:20,340
Why did he have to get executed on the day I was born?

162
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:24,800
Why did he stay alive and torture my dad so much?

163
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:27,820
Why? Why? Why?

164
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:37,060
But... I never once considered his situation.

165
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:44,340
Had someone understood him, could he have been different?

166
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:46,980
Could he?

167
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:51,060
I keep feeling hurt for him.

168
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:54,190
I keep feeling sorry for him.

169
00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:00,230
I want to apologize.

170
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:14,830
   
  

171
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:32,550
Jong Beom, are you hurting that much?

172
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:40,870
But seeing you like this, I feel more relieved for some reason.

173
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:45,700
That you can cry for someone else.

174
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:51,510
I'm grateful to convict Gong Ji Cheol.

175
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:57,460
I'll return this gratitude to you who looks like Gong Ji Cheol.

176
00:18:57,460 --> 00:19:01,930
If someday there's a reason to cry for you,

177
00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:07,690
I'll... cry for your sake with all my heart and soul.

178
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:25,980
 Prosecutor! 

179
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:31,610
Detective Cha, Gong In Woo has been arrested.

180
00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:34,630
Gong In Woo? On what charge?

181
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:37,120
Was he identified as the serial killer?

182
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,330
It's not that.

183
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:43,470
He tried to kill Jeong Sa Bin.

184
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,630
   

185
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:54,980
Please stop leaving by yourself!

186
00:20:07,050 --> 00:20:10,120
   

187
00:20:12,530 --> 00:20:14,860
 The pain's been too frequent lately. 

188
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:16,740
 What's going on? 

189
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:33,270
   

190
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:35,760
- Yes, Prosecutor Kim Soo Hyeok— 
   - Jeong Sa Bin, re you okay? 

191
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,270
You aren't hurt?

192
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:38,800
No, I'm fine.

193
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:41,500
Where are you right now? Where are you?

194
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:44,440
Please calm down. Is something wrong?

195
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:47,500
Jeong Sa Bin, has anything happened?

196
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,070
Are you sure you're okay?

197
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:52,250
I said I'm fine. So please stop asking.

198
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:55,540
Where are you? I have to see you right now.

199
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:58,200
I'm on my way to Old Future Bookstore.

200
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,710
Okay, I'll be right there.

201
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:28,560
I said I'm fine.

202
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:30,560
I'm not fine.

203
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:34,860
When I heard about you, I thought my heart would stop.

204
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:41,660
Let me... stay like this for a moment.

205
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:44,360
♫   Your eyes looking at me  ♫

206
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:49,850
♫   somehow look sad  ♫

207
00:21:52,370 --> 00:21:58,050
♫   When I look at you, the whole world  ♫

208
00:21:58,050 --> 00:22:03,980
♫   seems to have stopped while filled with you  ♫

209
00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:13,040
♫   Even if someday a difficult time comes for us  ♫

210
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:17,730
♫   I will not leave  ♫

211
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:23,030
♫   Even if the warm wind carries me away  ♫

212
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:28,530
 I'm happy just looking at you like this. 

213
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:32,500
 When you die, I'll be happy that I was your husband... 

214
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:35,020
♫   My dear, even if we don't say anything  ♫

215
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:38,600
 And if you die, 

216
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:41,340
 I can live longing for this very moment. 

217
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:46,590
♫   You're the one I want to see  ♫

218
00:22:58,030 --> 00:23:00,700
I know now isn't the right time.

219
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:05,790
But when the time comes, please put this on me yourself.

220
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:08,340
That ring.

221
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:12,490
Whenever that is, I'll wait.

222
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:22,940
♫   Even if the warm wind carries me away  ♫

223
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:25,600
Yeah.

224
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:30,630
Okay.

225
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:32,600
♫   My dear   ♫

226
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,530
Just wait a little longer.

227
00:23:34,530 --> 00:23:39,450
I'll put everything back in its place and come back to you.

228
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:45,180
♫   You're the one I want to see  ♫

229
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:59,060
♫   You're the one I want to see  ♫

230
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,290
Mister.

231
00:24:06,290 --> 00:24:10,040
I wasn't certain, but you are.

232
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:12,450
Take this.

233
00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:20,710
I feel like I should give it to you for some reason.

234
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:25,280
Why are you giving this to me?

235
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:27,880
Thirty years ago,

236
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:34,190
we had a funeral for my friend's daughter who looked just like you.

237
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:40,930
She had a fiancé whom she waited for until the moment she died,

238
00:24:40,930 --> 00:24:48,310
and she said that if he was alive, he'd return to this bookstore. And the priest

239
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:50,790
gave it to me.

240
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:56,700
I had a thought when I saw you.

241
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:59,310
That you coming here

242
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:02,770
and the recorder being given to me

243
00:25:02,770 --> 00:25:07,470
was not a coincidence. After having lived for so long,

244
00:25:07,470 --> 00:25:11,780
I see that everything happens for a reason.

245
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:36,020
 Today is January 25th, 1988. 

246
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:40,440
 The time is 5:15 a.m. 

247
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,910
 I love you, Hyeong Bin. 

248
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:47,170
I love you, Hyeong Bin?

249
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:51,550
 Don't forget this voice. 

250
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:55,130
 Even 20 or 30 years from now, 

251
00:25:55,130 --> 00:25:59,710
 I'll miss you then, too. 

252
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:10,510
 I love you, Hyeong Bin. 

253
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:16,470
I love you, Hyeong Bin?

254
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:24,580
 I love you, Hyeong Bin.

 I, Cha Hyeong Bin, will put my life on the line 
    

261
00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:46,470
 and protect my bride, Jeong Ha Eun, till the end. 

262
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:52,970
 Whether we're together or not, during the time from soul to eternity, 

263
00:27:52,970 --> 00:28:00,060
 I promise to only love Cha Hyeong Bin. 

264

♫   We'll certainly get together   ♫

265
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:07,440
 Hyeong Bin! 

266
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:13,820
♫   Like with the painting we looked at   ♫

267
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:17,260
 Ha Eun. God... 

268
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:19,860
 Please save Ha Eun...

♫   Draw me in your eyes that shone brightly   ♫

274

275
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:00,790
 How can he take a picture after killing someone? He's a monster! 

276
00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:02,540
 How does it feel to see your true self? 

277
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:04,410
 Just know that it's over for both you and me. 

278
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:07,190
 I heard something strange from Jong Beom. 

279
00:29:07,190 --> 00:29:09,180
 The woman who's been stabbed is with me right now. 

280
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:10,390
 I told you it's not time yet. 

281
00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:12,100
 Does it drive you crazy that I hurt him? 

282
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:15,320
 Revenge isn't done with blood. You make them acknowledge their own sin while alive. 

283
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:17,940
 I have a list of unidentified remains. 

284
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:19,110
 This is the justice you spoke of? 

285
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:21,340
 I have to find out who tried to kill you. 

286
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:25,320
 I call Mr. Cheon Jong Beom to the witness stand.
