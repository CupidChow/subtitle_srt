00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:17,990
The difference between real and fake is this blood. Family?

3
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:20,860
How can you be family when your blood is different?

4
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:26,060
Doing only what someone wants you to do, how is that any different from the job of running errands?

5
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:29,910
Doing whatever it takes for the sake of someone else's happiness, even if you don't want to do it,

6
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:33,970
is that really family?

 Yearning, sorrow, and sadness... there are times when all those feelings surge up together.

14

 Regret is a feeling that a person can only have for someone they love.

24
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,820
The weapon got caught in the shoulder blade, so no damage was done to any membranes or organs.

25
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:55,630
You don't need to worry too much.

26
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:59,590
We just need you to sign the surgery consent form as her guardian.

You're not her husband?

00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:02,260
Exactly, why...

32
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:09,010

34
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:25,520
 We're tightening the screws on Jang Ma Cheol at the moment, but the damn bastard keeps spewing out strange BS. 

35
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:29,650
   

36
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:32,390

38
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,430
 He says Jeong Jong Beom told him to kill you. 

39
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:05,350
What happened?

40
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:07,430
How many times have you two been at this hospital already?

41
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:10,120
Please take care of her.

42
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,980
Let me know when she wakes up.

43
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:17,740
Don't you and I have a lot of things left to do?

44
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:21,270
You save Sa Bin, and she saves you.

45
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:26,080
You're both acting like you have several lives. I get that that's how Sa Bin is,

46
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,250
but you're not that type of a person, Prosecutor.

47
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:30,390
Someone who risks his own life for another.

48
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,740
Isn't this an ill-fated relationship?

49
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:34,790
One person always gets hurt when you two meet!

50
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:37,580
Please stop being with her!

51
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:47,000
   

52
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,950
 Hyeong Bin... 

53
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:08,440
 Until he finds me, 

54
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:13,530
 I... can't die. 

55
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:20,060
 If Hyeong Bin has died, 

56
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:25,030
  please let me at least see his body. 

57
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:01,560
"You didn't kill."

58
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:05,490
"I'm glad you didn't."

59
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:14,060
"I'm happy that I didn't let you feel regret." Are you going to say that again?

60
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:21,170
I'm scared right now... but there's no one I can tell.

61
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:26,930
You have to ask me why I'm scared.

62
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:30,400
There might not be an opportunity for you to talk to me,

63
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:35,530
and that's what scares me.

64
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:54,860
The patient in room 505 is having trouble breathing.

65
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:58,660
Really? Oh, the doctor is here.

66
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:10,950
How does that make sense? Why would he do the bidding of someone who stabbed him?

67
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:12,850
No matter how stupid Jang Ma Cheol is.

68
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:14,470
Don't try to make sense of it.

69
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:17,710
How could you comprehend the mind of someone who abets murder after getting stabbed?

70
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:22,330
But why are you Cheon Jong Beom's target?

71
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:28,390
He must hate me so much that he didn't get to kill me.

72
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:35,710
But why do you hang out with this loser

73
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:36,750
when you've got me?

74
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:40,550
Ah, this moron. Looking like someone who would easily be stabbed by gangsters.

75
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:45,230
Stabbed, my butt. You know nothing about goose fathers. 
 (T/N: work in Korea while family is abroad for education) 

76
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:48,890
A goose father has to survive until the end, no matter what.

77
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:52,140
I won't die that easily!

78
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:58,400
   

79
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:01,180
Yes, Sir.

80
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:06,240
We uncovered a familiar name while investigating Assemblyman Cho Hyeon Gook's slush fund.

81
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,250
Inseong Foundation's Baek In Seok.

82
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:12,980
Your father-in-law's been lining himself up all over the place.

83
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:15,330
We're adding reinforcements to the investigation team, so join in.

84
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:20,680
You know better than anyone else about that family.

85
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,610
I'll be right over.

86
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:26,150
What does Chief Prosecutor say?

87
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:29,350
The second autopsy of Im Hwa Yeong is at 4:00 p.m. today.

88
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:31,770
I'll see you in the autopsy room.

89
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:36,520
He just leaves by himself.

90
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:40,810
You know there can't be a conflict of interest during an investigation.

91
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:46,170
So just make sure you don't provoke suspicion. Someone who tells me to take down my own son...

92
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:47,650
you're more than capable of it.

93
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:53,990
It'll be explosive for Baek In Seo if you look into the scholarship and medical foundations.

94
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:58,920
And if you dig into Inseong Hospital infertility clinic's illegal sperm trading, it'll become a big issue, too.

95
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:01,870
I'll decide on the direction of the investigation.

96
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:07,460
It's your chance to take down your father-in-law.

97
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,490
You may leave.

98
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:22,370
I heard there's a second autopsy of Im Hwa Yeong.

99
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:27,220
The results of the initial autopsy and Heo Do Jin's statements are completely different.

100
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:31,590
What Heo Do Jin admitted, the way he held the knife, where he stabbed her, and how many times,

101
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:35,510
they don't line up at all with the wounds on the victim.

102
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:51,910
   

103
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:55,910
I'll catch Im Hwa Yeong's real killer for you, so all you need to do is sit around and wait.

104
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,630
I guess you're curious about Im Hwa Yeong's tattoo.

105
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:21,920
What is this ink?

106
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:26,330
It's not a tattoo, it's henna. It's a temporary tattoo.

107
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:30,420
What's unique is that oxidizer was added to the henna ink.

108
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:34,160
Natural ingredients are usually used because of side effects.

109
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,800
Oxidizer... What is its function?

110
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,600
It makes the tattoo more vivid.

111
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,750
Whether it's henna or a tattoo, they're more vivid while the skin's macrophages are alive.

112
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:48,700
Then the oxidizer was used because it wasn't vivid on the corpse.

113
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:52,610
That's it. The tattoo was applied after the murder.

114
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:55,290
Prosecutor, a tattoo artist is the culprit!

115
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:58,600
The tattoo isn't good enough for that to be true.

116
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:03,890
It's supposed to be his signature, but it's no better than a scribble.

117
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:10,110
Also, what's unusual is that a phosphorus component was found in the ink, but I'll let you know after further study.

118
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:16,460
Let's wrap up here. I have to go see Sa Bin at the hospital.

119
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:28,960
I have a flashlight already.

120
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:31,570
What kind of a detective doesn't know about UV lanterns?

121
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:36,620
It's not your average flashlight. You'll need it for the fingerprints and blood at the crime scene.

122
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:38,930
Hold onto it.

123
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:42,130
This is...

124
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:46,530
Satisfied?

125
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:47,510
Yes.

126
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:50,090
I'll put her back in.

127
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:56,620
Why isn't she going in?

128
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:58,810
Hold on.

129
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:01,010
Is something stuck?

130
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:02,890
I don't see anything.

131
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,290
Okay, that's it.

132
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:13,550
What is this? Is it glow-in-the-dark?

133
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:18,200
Not sure.

134
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:21,890
I'll have to look into that. 
      

135
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:46,910
Whose is this?

136
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:50,330
It's Jong Beom's.

137
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:54,070
The cover is a medical book, but the contents...

138
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:55,930
Why?

139
00:15:57,020 --> 00:16:02,190
What is it? I'm getting goosebumps. Is he a psychopath?

140
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:04,560
You know how when you watch movies,

141
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:08,510
psychopaths analyze people's facial expressions and copy them and stuff.

142
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:13,330
    

143
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:25,180
When did he come to the hospital? How did he know you were here?

144
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:29,300
He probably heard that I got hurt from my uncle. He lives in the rooftop room of my uncle's store.

145
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:31,940
Hold on. Hold on a second.

146
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:38,600
When you lost your phone before, didn't you say that Jong Beom or somebody found it for you?

147
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,740
Where is your phone?

148
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:44,480
Hurry and give me your phone. Hurry.

149
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:51,100
Look! Look at this! I knew it.

150
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:54,410
You were being completely stalked!

151
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:57,150
Did you know that an app was installed to track your location?

152
00:16:57,150 --> 00:17:01,350
What? No way.

153
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:03,200
     

154
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:08,240
Is it a coincidence that your diary disappeared?

155
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,990
Why are you scaring me?

156
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:12,980
Has there been anyone lately who always appears where you are?

157
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:17,380
Someone who seems to know everything about you when you didn't even tell them?

158
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:19,560
Has there really been no one?

159
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:26,230
 Oh, Senior. You live here? I have a regular at this studio apartment for my errand job. 

160
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:31,800
 What? You're a regular here, aren't you? 

161
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,030
 The place you wanted to take me was a game room? 

162
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:37,220
 To be more accurate, I wanted to ride a rollercoaster with you. 

163
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:52,230
Criminal Law, Article 250 and 254. A person who kills a person will be sentenced to death, life imprisonment,

164
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:54,980
or imprisonment of not less than five years.

165
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:59,260
Criminal Law, Article 31. Those who commit a crime by aiding and abetting others

166
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:02,500
will receive the same sentence as those who have committed the crime.

167
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:14,500
If a suspect attempts to kill the prosecutor who interrogated him, it's considered a revenge murder and may be subject to additional punishment.

168
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:25,060
Let me rephrase. It's actually a case of aiding and abetting a gangster to kill a prosecutor.

169
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:27,300
Aiding and abetting murder?

170
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:31,020
On April 10th at 4:00 p.m., on the day of the crime, you went to see Jang Ma Cheol,

171
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:34,580
and exactly eight hours later, he showed up in front of me holding a knife.

172
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:39,380
You have an interest in coaxing a gangster with nowhere to go to wield a knife?

173
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:42,870
Is there anything I've given Jang Ma Cheol in return for instigating him?

174
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:46,850
I only went there to apologize, since he got hurt because of me.

175
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:48,530
You must've given him an incentive to commit murder.

176
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:50,880
Incentive to commit murder?

177
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:55,900
You probably have one in your heart as well.

178
00:18:55,900 --> 00:19:01,450
People who you hate enough to kill. A kill list.

179
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:05,270
Won't you kill those people if you get the opportunity?

180
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:08,830
The existence of a kill list is aiding and abetting a murder.

181
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:12,720
Therefore, aiding and abetting a murder

182
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,090
isn't something someone else gives you.

183
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,150
What's your reason for coming here?

184
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:24,440
To apologize again?

185
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:33,090
A woman I like has gotten hurt. It's natural that I'm worried

186
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:35,060
Like?

187
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:39,200
- Who? 
 - Jeong Sa Bin.

188
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:48,910
You like her...

189
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:55,120
Yes. I like her.

190
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,550
Jeong Sa Bin.

191
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:59,720
That's why your kind gives me the creeps.

192
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:04,010
In your brain, you know how to say you love someone but you don't know how to apologize.

193
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:10,390
If the injured person is the woman you like, being unable to ever show up here

194
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:14,290
is what makes you a human being. You beast bastard.

195
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:18,150
Now you have one more reason to kill me.

196
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:22,370
Since I'm going to tell her today that you went and instigated Jang Ma Cheol to kill me.

197
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:23,760
Jeong Sa Bin.

198
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:29,380
Is there any reason that we still need to meet? The real culprit should have been caught.

199
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:31,970
Didn't you want to kill me?

200
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:35,020
The Im Hwa Yeong case isn't over for me yet.

201
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:36,500
You're still a suspect.

202
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:40,600
One more thing. My motive for murder is my principle.

203
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:45,340
My principle is to get rid of any bastard that messes with my people.

204
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:48,600
Is Jeong Sa Bin one of your people?

205
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:51,830
Just go protect the woman you're going to marry instead.

206
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,780
Yes, yes, Professor. Please go ahead.

207
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:19,720
It's called a UV ink. It used to be popular overseas.

208
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:23,100
 The glow-in-the-dark material fluoresces in black light. 

209
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:26,010
But the glow-in-the-dark material itself has side effects,

210
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:28,140
so it's not used much these days.

211
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:34,450
Then we should be able to locate the buyer if we check all the tattoo shops in the area.

212
00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:50,850
How did you know that I liked these?

213
00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:55,220
I didn't know you liked them. These are things I like.

214
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:58,440
Are purple tulips also the flowers you like?

215
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,900
I bought them on my way here because they were pretty.

216
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:07,170
How did you know that riding a roller coaster

217
00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:09,440
was on my impossible bucket list?

218
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:15,810
I read about your heart disease in the medical magazine.

219
00:22:15,810 --> 00:22:20,160
Patients with heart disease can't ride rollercoasters even if they want to.

220
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,940
Are you being honest?

221
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:23,540
Yes.

222
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:28,360
Could you please leave? I want to rest.

223
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:32,380
By the way, you left your bag.

224
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:44,870
Could you return my diary?

225
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:46,970
Return it.

226
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:37,950
How long have you been there?

227
00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:48,660
Your dad nearly got hurt because of me.

228
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:53,210
This time, you almost died because of me.

229
00:23:53,210 --> 00:23:58,080
That's why I told you not to make enemies. The people around you will get hurt.

230
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,420
How are you feeling?

231
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:03,270
I'm fine. It's stuffy in this hospital, so I'm going to get discharged soon.

232
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:06,730
I'm tired of giving you warnings and advice, so I'll give you a gift.

233
00:24:06,730 --> 00:24:08,890
A gift?

234
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:12,180
Why this...

235
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:15,720
But I'm bad with gadgets so even if I wear it, I probably won't use it correctly.

236
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:19,100
It's a smartwatch provided by the police department for personal protection requests.

237
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:22,780
If you tap "Emergency" in an urgent situation, it'll contact a nearby police station.

238
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:25,340
Huh?

239
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:26,490
That's weird.

240
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:30,230
But why is the police station's number a cell phone number?

241
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:32,360
Is it a police officer's phone number?

242
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:35,490
What's that police officer's name?

243
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:53,150
Can I ask when you're getting married?

244
00:24:57,870 --> 00:24:59,920
I'll get going now.

245
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:07,690
The watch has a location tracker, but if you don't want it, you can turn it off.

246
00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:10,070
My location goes to the police station?

247
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:11,870
You know what I mean.

248
00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:15,320
If you don't like being monitored, stop butting in.

249
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,870
I heard from Detective Joo.

250
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:31,580
I heard the NFS intern was the one who instigated your murder.

251
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:37,320
His name is Cheong Jong Beom, right? He was a medical student...

252
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:02,390
 Are you asking me to prove that you and I are different? 

253
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:49,660
 Could you leave now? I want to rest. 

254
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:02,170
 I'm going to get rid of this. 

255
00:28:02,170 --> 00:28:04,150
 Bye. 

256
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:12,560
  I could kill her for you if you want. 

257
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:20,510
What? Did my Manson find something again?

258
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:36,460
  Indifference.  

259
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:48,460
Even if it's underground or underwater, he always knows his owner's scent.

260
00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:38,980
Where's the next place? This is already 137!

261
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:42,910
 If you turn the corner after one more block, on the first floor of the building with the glass façade  

262
00:29:42,910 --> 00:29:45,040
 is a needle tattoo shop called Their World. 

263
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:47,390
No, no, not a place like that. Someplace that seems like

264
00:29:47,390 --> 00:29:50,360
perverted bastards would go.

265
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:53,450
Like where it smells like mold. Isn't there anywhere like that?

266
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:56,700
Hold on.

267
00:30:08,690 --> 00:30:11,040
    

268
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:15,130
    

269
00:30:20,050 --> 00:30:22,090
Are you here for a tattoo?

270
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:26,330
I'm with the police.

271
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,090
By chance,

272
00:30:29,090 --> 00:30:34,690
has anyone come to buy UV tattoo ink recently...

273
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:42,660
This! This butterfly tattoo on the neck.

274
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:45,650
That woman? She's a customer who's come a few times.

275
00:30:45,650 --> 00:30:49,170
I remember her because her skin is white as porcelain.

276
00:30:49,170 --> 00:30:52,540
Tattooing that kind of skin is a tattoo artist's dream.

277
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:56,200
Everyone wants to tattoo on that kind of skin.

278
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,060
Were you asking about the UV?

279
00:30:58,060 --> 00:31:01,830
Is this... what's called a UV tattoo?

280
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:06,330
That's called a black light.

281
00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:10,170
It's a tattoo that can only be seen under ultraviolet light.

282
00:31:10,170 --> 00:31:13,070
I'm investigating a murder, and I'd like to ask for your cooperation.

283
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:16,490
Is there anyone who came here to buy UV ink recently?

284
00:31:16,490 --> 00:31:20,890
If I give out customer info, I'll lose customers.

285
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:24,870
You have nice skin. Would you like a tattoo?

286
00:31:24,870 --> 00:31:27,020
A police officer can't have tattoos.

287
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:30,280
I have never done it in my 50 years of life.

288
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:54,210
 Hello? 

289
00:31:54,210 --> 00:31:58,570
You've gotten a tattoo at the Idion shop, right?

290
00:31:58,570 --> 00:32:00,650
A butterfly on your neck.

291
00:32:00,650 --> 00:32:01,460
I have.

292
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:06,010
I'm Detective Joo In Do, from the Violent Crime Team at the Western Police Department.

293
00:32:06,010 --> 00:32:10,270
While investigating a murder case, I found out that someone at this phone number

294
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:14,680
purchased UV tattoo ink.

295
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:18,590
I'd like to meet you and discuss some things.

296
00:32:18,590 --> 00:32:20,820
Could I meet you?

297
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:29,110
I just need to verify some facts.

298
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:31,230
Could you cooperate with the investigation?

299
00:32:31,230 --> 00:32:34,200
- Are you alone, Detective? 
 - Yes, of course.

300
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:36,500
Then come to Eternity.

301
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:39,320
It's a small gallery at the Gangsong-ro intersection.

302
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:40,900
Sure.
