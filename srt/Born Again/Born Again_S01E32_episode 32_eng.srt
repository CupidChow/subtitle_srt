1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:02,440
  
 We did an ultrasound, 

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:05,720
and the left ventricle is functioning poorly and enlarged.

3
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:10,680
But at her last physical, you said she was fine. Why all of a sudden?

4
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:14,700
Has she been through something difficult recently?

5
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:17,170
Broken heart syndrome...

6
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:21,930
It's a symptom that appears when you experience something like the death of a loved one.

7
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:25,060
The stress hormone contracts the blood vessels to the heart

8
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:29,270
and makes the heart muscle unable to do its job.

9
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:33,180
Usually, people recover quickly but in her case,

10
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:35,800
I think it's igniting the aftereffects of the heart transplant.

11
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:38,480
Then... what's going to happen from now on?

12
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:43,610
Right now, we can only watch her and hope it doesn't get worse.

13
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:45,820
What happens if it gets worse?

14
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:49,500
If it does, the only solution is another heart transplant.

15
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:53,260
But the waiting list is very long, and right now,

16
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:56,130
it would be very difficult to get to the top of the list.

17
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:58,580
We will look for another solution.

18
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:01,430
Please...

19
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:06,300
What happened to her that she's so sad it's ruining her heart?

20
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:09,430
Do you know anything?

21
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:19,480
Please stay by her side, I'll be back.

22
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:25,710
This is so upsetting, I'm going to go crazy!

23
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:47,150
Tell me... What happened between you and Jeong Sa Bin?

24
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:49,600
I don't want to talk about it.

25
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,600
It's not time for you to be drinking.

26
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:58,580
Jeong Sa Bin's been admitted to the hospital.

27
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:02,790
- What? 
 - She's in severe pain that you can only experience when a loved one dies.

28
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:07,390
Why the heck is that? Is it because you two broke up?

29
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:15,280
Then get back together.

30
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:18,140
I can't stand...

31
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,360
Jeong Sa Bin being sick.

32
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:26,040
I did...

33
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:31,560
hurt her.

34
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:35,920
But it's not something I can help with.

35
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,470
So now,

36
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,830
you stay by her side.

37
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:46,430
That'll do.

38
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,420
I can't do that.

39
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:53,270
I also want to do that,

40
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:57,710
but I'm not able to do that now.

41
00:02:58,250 --> 00:02:59,700
Why?

42
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,240
I'm...

43
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,760
going to die soon.

44
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:14,260
 So... 

45
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,080
 you have to stay by her side. 

46
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:47,460
Ha Eun.

47
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:52,760
When did you get here?

48
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:56,740
You were right.

49
00:03:57,450 --> 00:04:01,430
Burdening someone who's been hurt with forgiveness

50
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:03,700
is too cruel.

51
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,600
In this lifetime, too,

52
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:09,120
I shouldn't have told you.

53
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,460
No. Thank you for being brave.

54
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:16,140
I'm...

55
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:20,170
not in pain because I'm upset or angry at you.

56
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:25,600
Even then, when my mom and dad passed away, my heart

57
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,490
became very unwell.

58
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:34,560
This time, too, I'm sure I'm hurting this much because I'm sending them off again.

59
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,140
Sending a loved one away...

60
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:42,310
my heart can't seem to take it.

61
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:48,000
Can you help me up?

62
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,730
Okay.

63
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:07,450
I can't take these.

64
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:10,850
I'll give these rings back to you.

65
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:29,140
From the first moment I met you,

66
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:32,290
my heart strangely raced.

67
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:38,410
When your heart beats so much that you can't control it, that's love...

68
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:42,090
But...

69
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:48,260
now I know. My heart beating without me realizing

70
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:51,050
was because of Ha Eun.

71
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,920
That's why whenever I thought of you,

72
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:59,460
my heart hurt this much.

73
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:06,470
Cheon Jong Beom... Jong Beom...

74
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:09,960
is someone who makes my feelings hurt.

75
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:14,180
At first, I wasn't sure if I felt hurt or my heart was hurting.

76
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:18,720
I was flustered and confused, too.

77
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,260
But now,

78
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,030
I'm not confused.

79
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:27,910
Who is in my heart,

80
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:29,970
I am certain now.

81
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:35,610
♫   Even while exhausted in this spinning love   ♫

82
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:40,310
♫   I say that I'm fine   ♫

83
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:43,060
Okay.

84
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:47,300
You need to be healthy in order to live with that certainty.

85
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:49,260
Recover quickly

86
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:52,080
and get up.

87
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:06,510
Please just stay alive.

88
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:11,090
I...

89
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:14,640
will become your heart.

90
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:38,240
Seong Ha was... I can't do it.

91
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:42,550
Oh, let me type it. Big Bro, my fingers are sincere.

92
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:46,060
You just have to say what's sincerely in your heart, so I'll do it.

93
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:48,610
Wow, our Ma Cheol, you've grown so much.

94
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:51,130
- I'm sorry, Big Bro. 
 - No, no. You come and take care of it; give it a shot.

95
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:53,500
Yes, Big Bro!

96
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:59,390
So what it is, is that at the time, Seo Seong Ha

97
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:03,520
liked Im So Hee who was a kindergarten teacher—

98
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:07,430
- You can tell me more quickly. 
 - Do you think long sentences are easy for me, you punk?

99
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:11,380
- Hey! 
 - Hey!

100
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,820
Hey, what's wrong? Were you stabbed? Where? Huh?

101
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:18,690
Hurry, call 911. Hurry!

102
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:22,090
Don't make the call... Wait.

103
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:25,280
I'll be fine if I wait a bit. Please wait.

104
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,930
Help me get him up. Hurry.

105
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:30,030
Come on.

106
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,190
Careful.

107
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:37,200
Are you okay?

108
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,060
I have something to tell you, Brother.

109
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:42,950
- Just the two of us. 
 - Okay.

110
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:53,230
But do you know what you just called me?

111
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:59,410
- Brother. 
 - You, punk.

112
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:02,970
I wondered if I'd ever hear you call me Brother.

113
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,940
I'm dying.

114
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:10,360
- What? 
 - The bullet from back then

115
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:14,770
- keeps going somewhere strange. 
 - Why would you die, you punk?

116
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:17,870
You won't die. Whoever I save doesn't die.

117
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:20,610
- I'm going to die. 
 - No.

118
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:24,160
You can remove the bullet with surgery. Then you can live.

119
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:31,700
My chance of survival is 10%. I'd probably die during surgery.

120
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:42,990
How much time do you have left?

121
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:45,260
I'm sure I'll die someday.

122
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:51,010
It's a month at best. So...

123
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:53,390
The favor I'm about to ask you,

124
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,580
you have to do it no matter what.

125
00:09:57,140 --> 00:10:00,590
- It's my final will. 
 - Hey, you jerk.

126
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:02,790
Promise me.

127
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,260
 Do whatever you have to do 

128
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:13,280
 and put Jeong Sa Bin next in line for a heart transplant. 

129
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:17,810
 Brother, you have all the files on Jang Hye Mi aiding and abetting murder, right? 

130
00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:20,140
 Use that to influence Chairman Baek. 

131
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:23,860
 Since his daughter got life in prison, it should work. 

132
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:27,050
Good morning, Chairman.

133
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:30,050
We don't have that kind of relationship where we can meet out in the open like this.

134
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:32,160
We'll take you somewhere quiet.

135
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,390
I have something to tell you about your wife as well.

136
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:38,460
Yes, Chairman.

137
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:42,670
Pardon? That's not something that I can...

138
00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:48,540
Yes, I understand, Sir.

139
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,380
   

140
00:10:57,380 --> 00:11:02,190
 And get me admitted to the hospital you use. 

141
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,890
 The place that handles all the injuries for your guys. 

142
00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:09,920
 It has to be a place where they can perform CPR immediately. 

143
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:30,480
 And get me an ampule of potassium chloride. 

144
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,770
 The rest I'll tell you when it's time. 

145
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:59,070
Happy now?

146
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:00,410
Thank you.

147
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:03,140
I don't know if I'm doing the right thing.

148
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:11,800
Brother... let me see Jeong Ha Eun's face one last time.

149
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,950
Can you move?

150
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:17,180
I'm okay today.

151
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,830
Let's go then.

152
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:32,550
Are you okay, punk?

153
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:42,940
Brother... thanks for always being my family.

154
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:45,250
You bastard, seriously.

155
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:50,510
If you say thank you one more time, I won't be your family. That's not what family does.

156
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:56,100
Mom and Dad and my brother,

157
00:12:57,050 --> 00:13:00,430
they've never asked me how I felt.

158
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:04,890
Was your grade okay this time?

159
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:10,580
How's school? Are you healthy?

160
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:18,200
They only asked those kinds of things. But I realized after seeing you,

161
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:22,640
that this is what family is.

162
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:27,370
Jong Beom, let me ask you for the last time.

163
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,440
Are you really going to go like this?

164
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:37,550
I'm going to die anyway. Giving Jeong Sa Bin my heart

165
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:39,390
will make me feel less wronged.

166
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:44,450
You punk... it's not like you have no chance of surviving surgery!

167
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:10,540
   

168
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:14,610
Jong Beom, where have you been?

169
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:17,930
I couldn't get hold of you for days. What happened?

170
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:19,890
Senior.

171
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:28,680
Take your time.

172
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:44,450
What's the matter? Are you sick?

173
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:46,300
Is that why you didn't call me?

174
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:50,430
No. I'm not sick anymore.

175
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:54,160
Let's go see the stars together.

176
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,890
Stars?

177
00:14:56,890 --> 00:15:05,050
♫   Your eyes looking at me somehow look sad   ♫

178
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:13,200
♫   When I look at you, the whole world  ♫

179
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,990
Wow!

180
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:17,720
I didn't know there was a place like this at this hospital.

181
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:22,490
The sky is clear, so I thought the stars would be visible,

182
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:24,730
but I guess it's not easy to see the stars in Seoul.

183
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:26,530
♫   Even if someday a difficult time comes for us  ♫

184
00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:33,410
Then next time, let's go somewhere together where we can see the stars well.

185
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:36,700
When I get discharged, let's go together where it's easier to see the stars.

186
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:40,630
Gangwon or Jeolla Province, let's go there.

187
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:44,120
With the chewy sticks and the dalgona that you love? 
  (T/N: Dalgona coffee is a recent fad beverage made by whipping equal proportions of instant coffee powder, sugar, and hot water until it becomes creamy) 

188
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,890
Of course.

189
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:49,270
Let's put a tent up and listen to music on cassette tapes, too.

190
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:51,200
And with the instant coffee that's sweet.

191
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,900
With a book that each of us likes.

192
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:54,980
♫   Even if I'm just looking at you  ♫

193
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:56,520
Wow.

194
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:59,900
Just thinking about it makes me really happy.

195
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:03,190
Why would you just think about it? Let's really go.

196
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:20,360
Senior, I'm leaving tomorrow to go study abroad.

197
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:24,080
I was preparing for it, and that's why I was busy.

198
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:30,600
Why... are you suddenly going to study overseas?

199
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:33,220
You know how my mom is.

200
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:42,710
So... are you really going?

201
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,510
Yes.

202
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:51,130
To be honest, my mom found a hospital that can do the surgery.

203
00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:55,070
I'm going to receive surgery, too, while I'm there.

204
00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:58,610
How long will you be gone?

205
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:01,130
I'm not sure.

206
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:07,400
I'll know when I get there, but about five years?

207
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:12,740
Five years... that's a little long.

208
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:16,960
No. It's very long.

209
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:22,070
What kind of man would avoid being with someone he loves for two lifetimes?

210
00:17:22,070 --> 00:17:24,230
♫   On top of the bare branch   ♫

211
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:26,340
Can you not go?

212
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:30,590
Can't you just stay here with me?

213
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:35,070
I can become your guardian and you can get surgery here.

214
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:40,480
I'm... your family.

215
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,770
♫   It only adds to the loneliness   ♫

216
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:44,820
No.

217
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:47,130
I can't.

218
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:50,300
♫   Exhausted by bird sounds all night,   ♫

219
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:53,370
I see...

220
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:59,480
♫   Will the single leaf fall   ♫

221
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:05,730
♫   Even if you stayed far away it would still bloom   ♫

222
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:11,560
♫   The flower cluster that couldn't bloom is sure to bloom   ♫

223
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,240
It's today.

224
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:28,160
Please prepare Patient Jeong Sa Bin without any problems.

225
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:32,180
Tell the chairman that this is the first and last time.

226
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:48,750
What are you scheming for Jeong Sa Bin?

227
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:52,160
Do you want me to go ask the head of the hospital myself?

228
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,830
Where's Cheon Jong Beom?

229
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:05,120
He's gone.

230
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:08,860
He's leaving tomorrow to study abroad.

231
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:17,330
Today... he came to say goodbye.

232
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,890
Cheon Jong Beom... isn't leaving to study abroad.

233
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,680
What's wrong all of a sudden?

234
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:39,720
Are you okay?

235
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,180
I don't have time.

236
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:45,760
We have to hurry up. Hurry.

237
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:03,270
Please hurry.

238
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:05,550
I have to stop him.

239
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:09,480
Hurry up and use the respirator.

240
00:20:22,810 --> 00:20:24,260
Come on.

241
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:26,160
Jong Beom. Jong Beom!

242
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,920
Come on! Get up.

243
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,610
You're nearly there.

244
00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:34,130
Just a little more.

245
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:36,260
Cheon Jong Beom, are you okay?

246
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:39,690
Hyung, the injection. Hurry.

247
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:41,580
Okay.

248
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:49,590
Please put the ampule into the syringe.

249
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,360
I'll do it.

250
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:09,590
I told you once.

251
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:14,940
No one wants someone they love to become a murderer.

252
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,950
Exactly five minutes after I pass out,

253
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:20,900
make sure I receive CPR.

254
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:25,620
That way the heart can be saved and the brain will die.

255
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:28,970
Remember. Five minutes.

256
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:38,600
No!

How can I live if you die?

261
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:07,620
Did you think I can live happily with your heart?

262
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:11,060
Whenever the heart beats, I'll have painful memories of you.

263
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:13,890
How can I live then, you dummy?

264
00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:16,690
You can't do this. Please don't do this.

Don't you give up. Hold onto even a tiny bit of hope.

Don't give up!

 I told you once.

 That if the day comes to shed a tear for you, I will cry sincerely with my entire being. 

282
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:20,260
 I will be crying for you. 

283
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:23,270
 So... you have to come back. 

284
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:27,710
 You'll wait for me, Senior, won't you? 

285
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:32,240

00:23:57,130 --> 00:24:00,130
Happy Birthday!

290
00:24:00,130 --> 00:24:01,810
This is my present.

291
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:10,990
You can't do this.

292
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:13,150
Please get up.

293
00:24:14,610 --> 00:24:16,760
Please move aside.

294
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:22,500
Are you okay?

295
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:43,060
 It'll be hard to believe, but Gong Ji Cheol is still alive. 

296
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:46,260
 Now this story is a story of a beautiful man 

297
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:52,530
 who loves and deserves to be loved. 

298
00:24:52,530 --> 00:24:58,190
 And... a story of a woman who madly loved 

299
00:24:58,190 --> 00:25:01,000
  one man. 

300
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,770
   

301
00:25:11,770 --> 00:25:14,720
I'm the public defender assigned to this case.

302
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:20,130
People say it's hard to be acquitted with a public defender.

303
00:25:20,130 --> 00:25:21,880
Is that really true?

304
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:28,900
It's not a matter of a public defender or a private attorney but your guilt or innocence of the crime that will decide if you are acquitted.

305
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:31,360
Did you commit the crime?

306
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:35,910
The crime... yes, I did.

307
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:41,250
A colleague who was also a security guard criticized my son, so I pushed him out of anger.

308
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:44,690
But it wasn't a premeditated murder.

309
00:25:44,690 --> 00:25:48,510
I never intended to kill him.

310
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:52,800
Just because I defend you, it doesn't take away your crime.

311
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:58,780
But I'll do my best to defend you so that you don't receive a sentence that doesn't fit your crime.

312
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:17,980
What are you doing?

313
00:26:19,770 --> 00:26:21,990
Seong Ha was granted a retrial.

314
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:25,690
I'm glad. I was really worried. That's good.

315
00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:30,000
Is this what you call giving the illness and the medicine? Thanks anyway, Kim Soo Hyeok.

316
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,450
As soon as I heard, I came to see you.

317
00:26:32,450 --> 00:26:36,300
It'll be a long fight. Fight well until the end.

318
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:38,270
You know I have the guts for it.

319
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:43,970
By the way, I heard Jeong Sa Bin's bookstore is having an opening today.

320
00:26:45,130 --> 00:26:46,990
What's wrong?

321
00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:00,230
Hold on! 
    

322
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:01,890
Move it to the right a little!

323
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:02,750
That's the best I can do!

324
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:04,070
I can't do it anymore.

325
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:07,060
No, it has to move a bit more!

326
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:09,960
What are you talking about?!

327
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:12,650
It's leaning to one side too much!

328
00:27:12,650 --> 00:27:14,870
- This man! 
 - Uncles!

329
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:17,290
It would have been done already if you weren't wasting time fighting!

330
00:27:17,290 --> 00:27:21,020
Also, I said to do it quietly, didn't I? I'm reading.

331
00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:27,430
Hey! Are you happy to open up a used bookstore after giving up your job?

332
00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:28,370
Oh, it's so heavy.

333
00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:29,930
It's heavy!

334
00:27:29,930 --> 00:27:32,770
Hey, Team Leader said to come back whenever you want once you sort through your feelings.

335
00:27:32,770 --> 00:27:37,790
Jay, I'm the healthiest I've been since I was born.

336
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:43,130
I'm going to read as much as I want here and grow old slowly.

337
00:27:43,130 --> 00:27:45,390
Is he better now?

338
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:51,950
He seems comfortable. Like all the bad memories have disappeared.

339
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:58,360
Now, now!  We need to take rice cakes to the neighbors before the opening, Uncles.

340
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:00,690
Jay will come with us. Start.

341
00:28:00,690 --> 00:28:02,800
Start!

342
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:08,990
   

343
00:28:08,990 --> 00:28:11,550
 Uncles, you need to do more.
