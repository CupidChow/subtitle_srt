1
00:00:00,910 --> 00:00:04,240
   

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:08,900
When you ingest grapefruit while taking an immunosuppressant after an organ transplant,

3
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:14,100
don't you know it can cause abnormal heartbeat, abnormal respiration, and even death?

4
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:18,070
Because of a chemical compound, furanocoumarin, found in grapefruit, the effects of the immunosuppressant

5
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:21,840
can become five to ten times stronger and cause serious side effects.

6
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:27,470
How did you know I had a heart transplant?

7
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:30,710
Among the medical students, more of us know about it than those who don't.

8
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:35,610
I understand that your magazine interview was translated into five different languages.

9
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:41,590
The first person to get a heart transplant from a death-row inmate 18 years ago.

10
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:48,960
Oh, right. I have a present for you.

11
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,720
Present?

12
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:54,320
Since you like remains, I thought you might like old stones, too.

13
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:59,340
An old stone that's flown over from outer space.

14
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:02,970
It's a necklace made from a meteorite that fell in Argentina 5,000 years ago.

15
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:07,060
The astronomical observatory verified it, so it shouldn't be fake. Right?

16
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:09,340
It's a stone but it's glittery.

17
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:13,400
The way it changes colors should be amazing. Try it on.

18
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,580
 They say he only dates girls with surgical scars. 

19
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:43,700
There's something I want to ask, but... what do you think of women with surgical scars?

20
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:48,480
Surgical scars? If you're a medical student, there's no need to dislike them.

21
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:52,070
Are you done yet?

22
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:53,920
It's done.

23
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:58,360
Are you cold? Why are you shivering?

24
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:04,220
Obviously. I'm trusting my neck to someone else.

25
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:05,520
That's not it.

26
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:10,310
Not my neck, but I'm trusting my body to... That's not it either.

27
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:12,340
I'm leaving.

♫  and I am only looking at you    ♫

33
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:40,940
What are you doing?

34
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:46,690
♫  You are the one I miss  ♫

35
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:49,960
Fifyy centimeters long, assumed to be less than two months old.

36
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:52,880
We cannot distinguish its gender.

37
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:59,690
A child that ended up dying around the time it was able to see its mother.

38
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:04,610
Are you done?

39
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:07,570
This child didn't even have teeth yet.

40
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:10,460
The DNA results from the child's remains came back.

41
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:13,000
It is the child of Im Hwa Yeong from Pureun Studio Apartments.

42
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,330
And Cheon Jong Beom is the suspect in this murder case.

43
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:19,370
If you'd like, I can send you the case files.

44
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:22,380
Cheon Jong Beom?

45
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:33,270
Investigating while designating someone as a suspect

46
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:37,130
is the most dangerous, isn't it?

47
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:43,680
Why are you letting your guard down?

48
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:48,340
You can't give chances to someone like Cheon Jong Beom.

49
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:53,270
Sometimes an animal can appear like a human being while living among people, hiding its instincts.

50
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:58,200
Those bastards will rush in and chew people up anytime they're given a chance.

51
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:02,070
Murders don't happen in broad daylight,

52
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:04,590
but within those cracks.

53
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:09,530
The animals that come out of those cracks to hurt my people, I won't allow anymore.

54
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:13,680
That crack may not seem like much, but my father...

55
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:22,900
Why do you always get angry when you're with me?

56
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,690
I've never been angry.

57
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:30,560
I'll ask you again. Why do you always get angry when you worry?

58
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:35,140
- Worry? 
 - Right now, you're worried about me.

59
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:38,160
Let's stop.

60
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:57,310
You've separated the bones from flesh well, right?

61
00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:00,030
You're the best in your field, Uncle.

62
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:02,960
What about the bones? Did you throw them away properly?

63
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:07,290
Cheon Jong Beom?

64
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:09,680
I'll be there soon. Okay.

65
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,860
I overheard your conversation unwittingly. Can I get in on those bones and flesh that were separated, too?

66
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:16,130
What brings you here?

67
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:17,660
My home is near here.

68
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:20,350
Really? Where is it?

00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:23,790
  
   

70
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:25,680
This is your home?

71
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,280
No. This building's rooftop room.

00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:06,000

Hey, hey. Put that knife down right now!

83
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:17,540
I raised our Sa Bin with this knife!

84
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:22,060
If you're holding a knife looking the way you do, who would ever think you filet fish?

85
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:25,200
You look like a defector or an ex-convict who is out to kill his cheating wife.

86
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:28,560
A defector? An ex-convict?

Will commit murder!

Sa Bin, listen. Between someone who attempts murder

97
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:18,660
and a bastard who commits fraud by selling out his friend, who's worse?

98
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:21,340
- Honestly? 
 - Honestly.

99
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:24,070
I think they're one and the same.

100
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:28,290
Both should be ripped up and quartered.

101
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:36,210
But... personally,  the one who plays around with people's emotions is a little more unlikeable.

102
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:39,180
Right?! Right?

103
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:41,700
You... Hah!

104
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:44,930
Jong Beom, what do you think?

105
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:48,700
Tell us! Who's worse?

106
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:49,880
I'm curious about something.

107
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,440
Tell me. Tell me.

108
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:57,340
Was it that you gave up the murder or that you failed?

109
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:05,470
I'm sure you planned out the murder. Didn't you feel dejected after giving up?

110
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:07,870
Amen! Well...

111
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:10,930
those who have ears to hear will hear.

112
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:14,010
Our Jong Beom, are you a forensic psychologist?

113
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:17,930
With your looks and how you talk, you're just my type!

114
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:21,550
Those who have ears to hear, let them hear!

115
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:25,330

 - Go ahead and eat.

116
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:30,100
That's right.

00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:35,360
   

118
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:11,190
Hyung, aren't you going to ask me in? I came because I miss you.

119
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:13,780
Isn't it time to stop all this?

120
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:31,090
How can you live in a place like this?

121
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:35,020
Your blood really must be different from mine.

122
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:37,820
I don't think I could live here for even a day.

123
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:43,000
If Father finds out that you came here, he'll be really angry.

124
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,880
At me? It'd probably be at you.

125
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:02,480
You should hang things like these in your room. Don't you think so?

126
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:06,890
What? Did you leave them behind because you're coming back?

127
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,650
 Drink it, Brother. 

128
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:30,370
 If you don't drink the juice, 

129
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:32,440
 Mom will be so disappointed in you. 

130
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,450
His brother?

131
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:40,440
If I don't drink it, you'll be disappointed, not Mom.

132
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:44,680
Why don't you drink it? You should taste what you made at least once.

133
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:48,510
What? You drank it knowing?

134
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:54,530
We can never be family since you're this spiteful.

135
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:58,070
I feel sorry for you. Did you want to keep living in our house

136
00:10:58,070 --> 00:11:00,300
while drinking detergent?

137
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:04,280
 I don't need to drink it anymore. Take it all back. 

138
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:09,750
 I see. So you're saying we're not family anymore. 

139
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:19,920
Who are you?

140
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:24,510
Hello. I'm his brother.

141
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:28,850
Brother, I'm leaving.

142
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:31,050
By the way,

143
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:39,720
Mom said to make sure you attend the fundraiser this weekend.

144
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,550
My uncle told me to give you this.

145
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:58,300
He said it'll be cold up here because they're fixing the boiler.

146
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:12,570
Don't touch it.

147
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:14,740
I said, don't touch it.

148
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:54,590
Are you stupid?

149
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:59,300
If you knew someone was messing with your juice, you shouldn't have drunk it.

150
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:02,710
If that won't do, you should have thrown it in that person's face.

151
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:06,050
When your brother was doing something like this to you,

152
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:09,720
you should have at least alerted your family! Why would you drink this?!

153
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:15,300
I'm warning you.

154
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:17,610
Don't get any closer.

155
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:21,650
Why did you do that?

156
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:24,160
Tell me. Why did you drink it knowing there was detergent in it?

157
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,160
- Because I had to stay there. 
 - There?

158
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,830
That was the only place I could go.

159
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,630
Leave now.

160
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:40,090
Why?

161
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:43,840
Because you're a juvenile delinquent? Because you're a psychopath?

162
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:47,830
If that why your family treats you this way?

163
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:57,660
Even if you can't feel my anger, sadness, and suffering,

164
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:00,660
you can analyze and predict them.

165
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:04,480
It's called cold empathy.

166
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:21,220
I can feel your anger, sadness, and suffering.

167
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:26,730
It's what you call hot empathy.

168
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:36,070
So there's no one in this world who isn't able to empathize with others.

169
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:42,700
Please leave.

170
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:31,570
 I'm going to go find her even if it kills me. 

171
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:34,860
 I'm going to go find her even if it kills me. 

172
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:19,210
You don't look well. Is something wrong?

173
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:22,150
I have some things on my mind.

174
00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:29,670
Soo Hyeok, your mate in this lifetime is Sang Ah. She's your soulmate.

175
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:34,510
You have to make sure you protect her no matter what happens to her.

176
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:36,840
Did you two plan this?

177
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:43,760
I heard that a relationship so full of affection that it hurt in your past life comes back only to graze past you in the present.

178
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:50,720
But a bad relationship in your former life will come back to you in order to untie that knot.

179
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:56,050
So no matter what, you have to take care of each other and love each other.

180
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:59,840
Soo Hyeok, you heard Mom, right?

181
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:02,600
You have to be nice to me.

182
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:08,500
I guess you're okay with the bad relationship in our past life.

183
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:17,770
I started making these because a regular customer who's an archaeology professor requested them.

184
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:21,450
It's perfect as a side project.

185
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:28,710
If this was a ring, I'd engrave today's date on it.

186
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:30,500
Right, Mom?

187
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,710
Too bad.

188
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:50,570
 The ring that he couldn't give up until the moment of his death, I'll make sure to put it on for him. 

189
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:54,750
♫   In my dream... In my dream, I saw yesterday   ♫

190
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:56,330
Where are you right now?

191
00:17:56,330 --> 00:17:58,320
I'm at the autopsy room, of course. Why?

192
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,570
 I'll be right over. 

193
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:07,850
♫   One I've never seen and whose name I do not know   ♫

194
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:10,810
Hello, Mister. What is it?

195
00:18:10,810 --> 00:18:13,420
Why are you beating so fast again?

196
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:17,100
♫   My lover who grazes by my past dream   ♫

197
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:25,760
♫   I think thoroughly tonight   ♫

198
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:31,760
♫   You were that familiar image I may have seen somewhere   ♫

199
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:38,440
♫   The image of love I had forgotten   ♫

200
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:41,840
It's the weekend. You're interrupting my leisure time.

201
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:44,520
I'll leave once I give you this.

202
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:49,360
This is...

203
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:54,250
We discovered six bodies related to Byeon Seong Hoon's case, and there will soon be a hearing.

204
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:56,830
Give the ring back to the rightful owner.

205
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:01,290
I'll leave now.

206
00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:06,190
Wait. Since you're here, let's go together.

207
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:11,590
You have to go return the ring with me.

208
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:24,770
   

209
00:19:48,810 --> 00:19:50,850
Elder.

210
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:56,510
This stamp, is it used at this store?

211
00:19:56,510 --> 00:19:57,760
   

212
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:01,170
Not now, but it was used a long time ago.

213
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:03,140
- Here. 
 - I see.

214
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:10,430
Then, how long have you been running this bookstore?

215
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:14,190
About 30 years?

216
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:18,990
The owner passed away, and after his daughter died,

217
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:21,060
- I took it over. 
 - Oh.

218
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:23,000
His daughter?

219
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,900
Then you must know the daughter well.

220
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:28,100
She's been dead for many years.

221
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:31,410
I even went to her funeral.

222
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:34,080
Thirty years ago.

223
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,860
- Oh, she died? 
 - Yeah.

224
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:42,610
I knew this would happen. Did you think you'd be able to meet her if you blindly came?

225
00:20:54,970 --> 00:21:00,290
She looks... so much like her...

226
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:08,850
But it feels like time has stopped here.

227
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:11,080
It could feel that way.

228
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:15,990
For 30 years, no new books have come in.

229
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:20,910
I want to leave it as is until I die.

230
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:31,500
This book went out of print! Wow.

231
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:36,290
Look!  There are dissertation papers here, too. Amazing.

232
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:39,450
Prosecutor, pick out a book for yourself, too.

233
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:43,400
It's my treat today.

234
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:46,490
Weren't we here to find the owner of the ring?

235
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:04,310
   

236
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:09,070
I'll take this one.

237
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:19,550
Oh, it's raining.

238
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:23,710
You're going to get the book wet.

239
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:33,500
Do you like it when it rains?

240
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:36,570
Everything that comes down from the sky is beautiful.

241
00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:40,490
It's beautiful, but all the cherry blossoms will be gone by tomorrow.

242
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:43,840
You know the big cherry blossom tree in front of the NFS?

243
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:47,800
I really wanted to take a picture in front of it this spring.

244
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:51,020
That tree fades away last.

245
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:55,580
- Pardon? 
 -  I said, that tree is the last one to fade away.

246
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:59,220
Do you like cherry blossoms?

247
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:10,240
I'll bring the car, so wait here.

248
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:18,750
I... got a heart transplant from an ex-convict.

249
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:25,160
I think his heart starts beating fast whenever I see you because he's scared of you.

250
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:32,750
But sometimes, I get confused about whether it's his heart or mine that's beating fast.

251
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:36,540
Can I try holding your hand once?

252
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:41,370
I just want to know whether it's my heart or his that's beating fast.

253
00:23:41,370 --> 00:23:46,250
To be honest, my heart has been beating fast since the first time I met you.

254
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:48,940
What?

255
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:54,010
♫   I won't leave   ♫

256

♫   Even if I'm carried away by the warm wind   ♫

257
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:03,490
Why? Was it not enough?

258
00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:08,360
If it isn't, can I take it further?

259
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:10,170
♫   My dear   ♫

260
00:24:10,170 --> 00:24:17,200

261

♫   You're the one I want to see   ♫

262
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:34,290
You're a medical university professor. Don't you have experimental ethics?

263
00:24:34,290 --> 00:24:38,140
I was a little... a little...

264
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:42,690
It is a little strange. I don't have an arrhythmia. Why does it beat fast whenever I see you?

265
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:46,950
My heart has never beaten fast because of a man.

266
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:50,050
I acknowledge that I have a strong experimental spirit,

267
00:24:50,050 --> 00:24:51,740
but...

268
00:25:56,470 --> 00:26:00,940
 It was the first day I felt someone else's pain. 

269
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:02,830
 And... 

270
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:30,870
Crazy...

271
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:04,140
 This woman who has accepted my darkness, 

272
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:06,400
 I've developed feelings for her. 

273
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:12,790

00:27:44,570 --> 00:27:45,590
 I see it. 

281
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:49,260
 It seems like you notice other people's wounds but not your own. 

282
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:51,840
 I'm happy that I didn't make you regret it. 

283
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:55,710
 I like you, so don't ever get hurt. 

284
00:27:55,710 --> 00:28:01,340
 Love? When someone doesn't return your love, it becomes an obsession. 

285
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:06,930
  
 In the end, Cain became mankind's first killer.
