1
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:05,330
     

2
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:34,540
     

3
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:43,360
 Timing and Subtitles by the Reborn Team @ viki 

4
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:46,260
Should I kill him now?

5
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:51,790
Three people went in... but two came out.

6
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:44,170
Kim Soo Hyeok... I knew a day like this would come.

7
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:52,160
Seong Ha, your brother is going to take revenge and bring back Ma Cheol.

8
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:14,160
You won't die. Don't die yet.

9
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,220
There are lots to do.

10
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,800
- Cardiac arrest! 
 - 120 joules!

11
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,880
  Shock!  

12
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,810
 To 160 joules! 

13
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:26,240
  200 joules!  

14
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,890
  200 joules, ready.  

15
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:29,670
  Shock!  

16
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:37,080
     

17
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,540
 Hurry, hurry! Hurry! 

18
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:05,320
"I know he's alive.

19
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:10,570
He will return in his own time.

20
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:15,960
From time to time, I come across those who have met Gong Ji Cheol.

21
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:25,570
 Gong Ji Cheol's prison guard in charge 

22
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:29,220
 kept it a secret that Gong Ji Cheol had a pen in his possession." 

23
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:30,240
     

24
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,820
     

25
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:33,900
     

26
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:21,760
     

27
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:24,460
   

28
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:41,820
Gong Ji Cheol, the devil artist, never regretted the murder.

29
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:45,280
He was blameless even on the execution grounds.

30
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:49,910
Since murder is... his work of art.

31
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,390
     

32
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:20,950
 Let's go see your wife at the hospital together. 

33
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:23,280
 She will have a healthy delivery. 

34
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,320
 Yes, Sir. I hope so. 

35
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:27,750
 Excuse me, is this Lawyer Jang Hye Mi's home? 

36
00:06:56,070 --> 00:07:01,240
 If you tell anyone that I'm alive... you... 

37
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:06,270
 and your family will die. 

38
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:27,340
  Do you believe that Gong Ji Cheol is alive somewhere?  

39
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:33,300
I'm not sure. I wrote this book, but the Gong Ji Cheol in this book

40
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:37,510
is only a devil that the world has created.

41
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:44,070
I mean, this could all be true, but it might just be a work of fiction by someone who fabricates freely.

42
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:50,760
Since people prefer to settle for lies over uncomfortable truths.

43
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:53,320
Should I read the next paragraph?

44
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,510
 The one who helped Gong Ji Cheol escape was a woman. 

45
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:13,490
 She tracked Gong Ji Cheol, who killed her sexually abusive stepfather. 

46
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:16,460
"That woman was Gong Ji Cheol's woman."

47
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:22,440
"Inside her belly... lived Gong Ji Cheol's child."

48
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,730
     

49
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:47,870
 There's cash inside the book. You're going to need it. 

50
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:51,970
 But must you go? 

51
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:54,950
 It would be better to hide for the time being. 

52
00:08:56,990 --> 00:09:00,700
 You told me to find out Jeong Ha Eun's whereabouts. 

53
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:03,190
 Open the last page of the book. 

54
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:08,520
 You can just go to the place written there. 

55
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:11,360
 It's the address of a hospital in Samcheok. 

56
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:14,500
   

57
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:26,010
 "And he went off to fulfill his last wish during the time he had remaining. 

58
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:29,350
That last wish was revenge.

59
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:34,120
The detective who harassed him and the detective's girlfriend who gave legal testimony,

60
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:39,690
Gong Ji Cheol believed they should pay for their sins."

61
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:44,140
 It's me, Jang Hye Mi. 

62
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:50,100
 Still I'm your ex-lover, your words are too harsh. 

63
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:56,420
 Oh right... Today, I saw Gong Ji Cheol, whom you ordered executed. 

64
00:09:56,420 --> 00:10:00,130
 You saw... Gong Ji Cheol? 

65
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:05,860
 April 7th, 1979, you remember the day he committed his first murder, don't you? 

66
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:10,750
 That day, Gong Ji Cheol fell and hurt his back while doing manual labor. 

67
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:14,290
 He was in critical condition for two days at Suncheon Hospital. 

68
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:19,580
 From what I remember, the yellow umbrella murder that day 

69
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:22,760
 occured near Cheongsin-dong in Seoul. 

70
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,060
 It's interesting. 

71
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:31,350
 How did Gong Ji Cheol, who was lying in a hospital in Suncheon, go all the way to Seoul to kill someone? 

72
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:34,270
 Didn't you check his hospital records? 

73
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:36,870
 What is it you want to say? 

74
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:41,260
 I'm saying make sure you kill him this time, don't make any mistakes. 

75
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:46,800
 If it's revealed that he's not the actual culprit, it'll put me in a very awkward position, too. 

76
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,620
 Like you. 

77
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:52,050
 There's a hospital near Samcheon harbor. 

78
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:55,140
 That hospital's name is Wonnam Hospital. 

79
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:57,410
  Go over there.  

80
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:19,140
 I will... forever... live with my mouth shut, Prosecutor. 

81
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:22,300
 You can leave. 

82
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,410
 - Hello? 
 -   You know,  

83
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:38,920
 about your drug smuggling case, 

84
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:41,760
 I'll take care of it. But there's something you have to do for me. 

85
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,150
 There's someone I need to get rid of. 

86
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:44,460
 What should I do? 

87
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:48,560
 He's a guy who's been executed. He's already... 

88
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:52,100
 He's already dead and you're asking me what you should do? 

89
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:13,520
   

90
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:16,480
   

91
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,680
     

92
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,760
 Come here and remove his hood. 

93
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:49,710
 We can't see his internal organs, but we need to see his eyes to grade them. 

94
00:12:58,050 --> 00:13:00,040
 Hey, what are you going to do by living longer? 

95
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:04,010
 We need him alive to get the heart, so don't kill him. 

96
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:27,160
     

97
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:35,490
 I stabbed him in a vital point. 

98
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:48,510
  No one saw Gong Ji Cheol's last moment. 

99
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:52,500
  If Gong Ji Cheol is alive...  

100
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:57,680
 He will return in his own time. 

101
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,510
 Cardiac arrest! 

102
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:02,590
 120 joules. 

103
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:03,630
  Shock!  

104
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:05,590
 To 160 joules! 

105
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:07,010
  200 joules!  

106
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:08,610
  200 joules, ready.  

107
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:10,680
  Shock!  

108
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,970
We got a pulse!

109
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:15,090
Prepare for surgery.

110
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:26,850
We have to go into surgery right away. Are you the guardian?

111
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:28,480
What is the patient's name?

112
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:32,190
His name... Oh, I called his parents, so they'll be here shortly.

113
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:35,880
Oh, hold on. Let's just do it, I'll sign.

114
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:42,110
I'm Cheon Jong Beom's mom.

115
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:46,140
Oh, it seems like he had cardiac arrest.

116
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:49,840
The side effects won't affect his brain or make him slow, will they?

117
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:52,240
He has a bullet in his head right now.

118
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:56,920
Before the bullet enters his brain, we need to go into surgery and remove it quickly.

119
00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:00,590
Then are you saying his brain has already been ruined?

120
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:05,100
I can't tell you how much damage there is until we operate.

121
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:10,020
Without a guarantee that there won't be any brain damage, I won't consent to the surgery.

122
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:15,100
If you can't save him without surgery, I'll take him elsewhere.

123
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:17,420
What are you doing?

124
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:18,510
Who are you?

125
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:23,460
Me? I saved your son's life.

126
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:26,390
Since I saved him, I need to keep him alive.

127
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:28,200
What are you doing? Prepare for surgery.

128
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:31,160
If this bastard dies, all of you die, too.

129
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,270
     

130
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:23,130
     

131
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:33,420
The bullet is closer to the brain stem than the CT scan showed,

132
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:35,590
so we couldn't remove the bullet.

133
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:39,870
So until the bullet moves away from the brain stem,

134
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:42,060
we need to observe him.

135
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:43,090
And brain damage?

136
00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:46,650
The bullet is lodged next to the temporal lobe,

137
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:49,810
an area called the hippocampus.

138
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:54,910
We'll know once he wakes up, but he may suffer from memory loss

139
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:57,920
where he doesn't recognize his friends or family;

140
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:04,000
or in the worst case, he could suffer from dementia or mental derangement.

141
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,470
What did you say? Mental derangement?

142
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:11,100
His hippocampus was damaged?

143
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:21,420
Excuse me! Just a moment.

144
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:23,380
I...

145
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:30,220
When Cheon Jong Beom wakes up, can you give this to him?

146
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:32,070
Please.

147
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:40,660
Your son is in no condition to go to the U.S.

148
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:45,320
We don't know if he'll live or die. Didn't you see he was shot in the head?

149
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:46,960
     

150
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:54,960
Not even gangsters do that to family.

151
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,760
     

152
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:15,710
Listen carefully, son. The herbal tonic your brother drank, starting tomorrow you drink it.

153
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:18,940
And you can't eat anything for snacks but dried fruit.

154
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:22,290
You know I gave birth to you on a plane on purpose, don't you?

155
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:24,850
You're an American citizen.

156
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:28,950
You don't need to compete with the losers in this tiny country.

157
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:34,120
You know that if you don't take after-school classes in the U.S. you become an outcast, don't you?

158
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:36,300
Let's have you take cello lessons.

159
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:41,150
Study for the TOEFL so you can make friends in the U.S.

160
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:48,330
   

161
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:58,910
Professor, I think Cheon Jong Beom's back from the U.S.

162
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:02,250
- What? 
 - I saw him in Insa-dong.

163
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:06,300
I don't think so. I've spoken to his parents. He's an exchange student in the U.S.

164
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:08,130
I'm sure it was him!

165
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:13,280
But... he seemed very different.

166
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:17,930
Something was off, like he was sick or something.

167
00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:32,370
Cheon Jong...

168
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:58,820
 Since I love you. 

169
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,890
 Do you want to be family? 

170
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:14,060
 Since I'm an ex-convict, too, I guess we are family. 

171
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:16,680
♫   Your eyes looking at me   ♫

172
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:22,390
♫   somehow look sad   ♫

173
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:27,630
♫   When I look at you,   ♫

174
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:30,500
 When you're flustered, you kick the ground with your foot. 

175
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:36,290
♫   seems to have stopped while filled with you   ♫

176
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:45,820
♫   Even if someday a difficult time comes for us   ♫

177
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:51,480
 You close your mouth and speak with your eyes. This is when you're worried. 

178
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:56,880
♫   Even if the warm wind carries me away   ♫

179
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:00,320
♫   You are my one and only love   ♫

180
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:04,790
     

181
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:06,440
     

182
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:10,080
   

183
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,570
     

184
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:18,720
Are you busy or sick?

185
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,670
Who is this?

186
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:26,710
Dad, what's wrong?

187
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:30,540
Your pretty nurse didn't come by today?

188
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:34,300
I'll be right over. We should have some sweet rice drinks.

189
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:56,020
   

190
00:22:06,390 --> 00:22:08,550
   

191
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,860
 Over there. 

192
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:18,360
Who do we have here? It's the Rambo prosecutor who got suspended for a year because of a firearm accident!

193
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:19,490
Brief me.

194
00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:21,700
We found a hiker this morning.

195
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:26,620
Name Kim Yi Soo, age 33. In the ground under the tree where the remains were found,

196
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:28,880
this was discovered.

197
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:33,190
The forensics department thinks it fell off the body.

198
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:34,590
It's a heart transplant patient.

199
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:39,230
We'll have to do a detailed autopsy, but looking at the skull and thyroid cartilage fracture,

200
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:42,420
it seems that the victim was hit with a blunt object

201
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:47,040
and strangled with a nylon string.

202
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,020
Please carry out a detailed autopsy.

203
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:50,720
Yes, Sir.

204
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,900
Oh, let's see the umbrella.

205
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:55,890
Here.

206
00:22:55,890 --> 00:23:02,030
It's too detailed to call it a copycat crime. He's back, isn't he?

207
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:04,480
   

208
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:08,560
The victim's name is Kim Yi Soo. Why does it say Jeong Sa Bin?

209
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:14,830
Wait. Not writing the date means he's going to kill Jeong Sa Bin sometime in the future!

210
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:27,720
Dad, why are you so listless today?

211
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:37,170
   

212
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:51,120
Who are you?

213
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:57,480
Hello. I'm Han Hee Joo. I've been in charge of his art therapy from a month ago.

214
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,090
You're his daughter?

215
00:23:59,090 --> 00:24:00,800
Yes.

216
00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:05,160
   

217
00:24:13,890 --> 00:24:16,310
Your dad's yellow...

218
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:18,870
seems somewhat obsessive.

219
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:23,630
Other patients feel the active and positive energy from yellow,

220
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:29,050
but he feels fear and extreme anxiety.

221
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:32,160
He probably can't help it.

222
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:36,730
But he'll get better. Don't worry too much.

223
00:24:36,730 --> 00:24:38,960
Let's end the lesson for today.

224
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:41,070
Let's have a meal together sometime.

225
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:45,370
I'm so thankful to you for giving him private sessions.

226
00:24:45,370 --> 00:24:46,970
Let's do that.

227
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,800
     

228
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:57,950
Aren't you going to check? It could be an urgent text.

229
00:25:00,910 --> 00:25:04,060
 I'm at the NFS because of newly discovered remains. 

230
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:06,450
 Let's talk. 

231
00:25:06,450 --> 00:25:08,690
Excuse me.

232
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:20,940
You did well, Mister.

233
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:25,780
Your daughter will be able to live only if you keep obeying me well like you did today.

234
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:27,640
Got it?

235
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:41,190
 How long are you going to ignore my calls? 

236
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:43,330
You found remains?

237
00:25:43,330 --> 00:25:46,170
 Let's speak in person. 

238
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:50,330
Okay. I think I'll be there around 7:00.

239
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,150
   

240
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,520
Cheon Jong Beom?

241
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:37,730
You... who are you?

242
00:27:00,730 --> 00:27:02,290
You said Cheon Jong Beom died!

243
00:27:02,290 --> 00:27:05,640
 H-He did die, of course. After getting shot in the head. 

244
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:08,980
 B-Blood... he lost a lot of blood. 

245
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:12,880
Then who's calling me? He's the only one who knows this number!

246
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,960
Then bring his dead body to me!

247
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,990
Right now!

248
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:32,150
Are you... still alive?

249
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:40,500
Estimated height is 167 cm, weight, 49 kg.

250
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:46,300
The depressed fracture on the right looks like a tiny fracture in a radial shape.

251
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:53,230
I think this person was hit by something like a baseball bat, but the cause of death wasn't the temporal fracture.

252
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:57,950
The cause of death was from thyroid cartilage fracture. The hyoid bone was fractured on both sides.

253
00:27:57,950 --> 00:27:59,920
This is strangulation.

254
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:03,270
Jeong Sa Bin, what happened a year ago—

255
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:07,070
I don't want to talk about that.

256
00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:12,580
It's a difficult memory for me, too.

257
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:18,090
But the yellow umbrella that was found with these remains had your name on it.

258
00:28:18,090 --> 00:28:19,360
My name?

259
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:24,460
You need protection.

260
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:27,950
I'll call the police if I need protection.

261
00:28:50,330 --> 00:28:51,910
♫   Because you were the first to come close   ♫

262
00:28:51,910 --> 00:28:57,550
The yellow umbrella murder case, if Cheon Jong Beom is the culprit, why is this happening again?

263
00:28:57,550 --> 00:29:02,890
♫   Even if it's a love I can't fulfill   ♫

264
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:06,960
Are you going to call it a copycat crime again?

265
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:12,650
♫   I can't give up my heart, I can't   ♫

266
00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:20,200
I... don't dislike you for shooting Cheon Jong Beom.

267
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:24,000
It's because you insist that he's the culprit when you know it's not true

268
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,640
and because you don't regret shooting a person.

269
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:33,120
While I was suspended, I tracked Cheon Jong Beom.

270
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:39,150
He was known to have left to study in the U.S., but there were no records of him

271
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:42,630
leaving the country.

272
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:44,950
I have nothing more to say.

273
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:47,460
I told you once.

274
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:50,760
That I won't lose my people anymore.

275
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:55,960
Whether you dislike me or avoid me, it doesn't matter.

276
00:29:55,960 --> 00:30:00,230
As long as you're alive, that's good enough for me.

277
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:02,110
Like you are now.

278
00:30:03,410 --> 00:30:09,700
♫   even though it hurts, this is not goodbye   ♫

279
00:30:41,630 --> 00:30:43,600
Could you turn up the light?

280
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,770
Yes, Sir.

281
00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:54,670
Sorry, there are so many lights in this room, so—

282
00:30:54,670 --> 00:30:57,390
Hold on. Please turn it off again.

283
00:30:57,390 --> 00:30:58,300
Pardon?

284
00:30:58,300 --> 00:30:59,910
Please turn it off again.

285
00:30:59,910 --> 00:31:01,880
Yes, Sir.
