1
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:03,290
    

2
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:49,220
You always stroke my hair from behind. Is it a fetish?

3
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:51,250
It's a habit.

4
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:05,610
- Get in the back, Prosecutor Kim. 
 - Why don't you? I can't let anyone take the wheel instead of me.

5
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:16,520
You can't use your car, so use Sang Ah's for the time being.

6
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:20,810
- It's okay. 
 - She has a concert coming up, so I'm going to confine her to the practice room.

7
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:24,000
Just bring her home after practice.

8
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:30,170
I need to meet with someone for a bit.

9
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:39,350
Is something wrong?

10
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:42,160
When you have too many thoughts, you always go diving.

11
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,650
No, it's nothing to worry about.

12
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:47,690
Oh, I'm going to adopt a cat.

13
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:50,260
Should I get a Russian Blue? Or a chinchilla?

14
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:52,360
Pick the one you love less.

15
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,880
When you love something too much, you always throw it away.

16
00:02:57,090 --> 00:03:02,350
I turned it off so we won't be disturbed. We haven't been together in a long time.

17
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:06,850
I said I don't want to be disturbed.

18
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,810
- Did you just push me away? 
 - We'll get into an accident.

19
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:24,500
As long as you look at me, I don't care if I die.

20
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,840
I don't want to die in a car accident.

21
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:30,050
But yet, you got into an accident like that?

22
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:33,610
You got hurt in order to save that woman.

23
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:37,090
- That woman? 
 - I heard from the doctor at the hospital.

24
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,920
She's a researcher at the NFS.

25
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:44,790
I guess that researcher was a precious person to you.

26
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:47,380
Enough to risk your life.

27
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:50,320
   

28
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,580
He ignores me?

29
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:10,590
Lives up to his formaldehyde face.

30
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,100
Hello? Prisoner #3731.

31
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:26,270
Our death-row convict man, no way...

32
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:29,630
Has he never dated in his life?

33
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:33,680
He's really acting up...

34
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:59,100
This is not a puzzle game! It's impossible to reconstruct without the cheekbones and the nasal bones!

35
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:02,750
Also, no matter what a professional engineer I am,

36
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:05,660
we don't have the orbital bones, so what do you want me to do?

37
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:10,330
And I'm not the creator who forms people out of clay!

38
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:17,130
We don't have the pieces of bones, but I brought this person's special DNA.

39
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:21,760
A Koryak  (indigenous people in Kamchatka)  gene. Not even 1% of Koreans have it.

40
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:27,810
He has the classic Korean gene on his father's side, but a Siberian gene in the mitochondria.

41
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:32,010
There must have been a Russian somewhere on his mother's side.

42
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:34,100
- Make the nose bigger. 
 - Okay.

43
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:37,190
- Bigger or higher? 
 - Higher.

44
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:41,450
No, stop making it so big.

45
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:44,710
- Okay. 
 - Make his eyes more deep set.

46
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:47,140
- Deep set. 
 - Yeah.

47
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:51,040
- Make his skin more Russian. 
 - So more pale?

48
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,410
- Yeah. 
 - Okay.

49
00:05:55,560 --> 00:06:00,900
I... feel like I've seen this face somewhere.

50
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:10,580
I've sent Prosecutor Kim Soo Hyeok the identification opinion, so you send him

51
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:13,110
the facial restoration file. Okay?

52
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:15,710
What did you write down in your identification opinion?

53
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:19,460
Are you really going to give false testimony at the trial?

54
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:29,980
I'll say just one thing. Three years ago, Prosecutor Kim and I saw the same things and had the same feelings.

55
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:32,860
If these remains can save someone else,

56
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:35,790
I'll do whatever he asks.

57
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:39,730
What did you see three years ago?

58
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:47,290
Am I the only one who doesn't get it? Do you understand what she's saying?

59
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:51,390
Well, not sure. But if what you want is to find the mummy's family for him,

60
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:53,750
then there should be plenty of ways.

61
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:05,270
26...

62
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:10,600
Let's register on the blog first.

63
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:13,240
   

64
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:20,370
A man who read  Wuthering Heights  for 30 years.

65
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:35,000
Restoration results of his remains show his face to be similar to this.

66
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,680
By chance, if the family of a missing person

67
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:45,440
who was in his 20s between 1985 and 1987 is out there,

68
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,680
please contact me.

69
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:55,930
Special note, I have this wedding ring.

70
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:07,410
At the time he disappeared,

71
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:10,640
I think he was looking for the book,  Wuthering Heights ,

72
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:16,470
at a bookstore called An Old Future Book Store.

73
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:23,280
The book was discovered with his remains at the excavation site.

74
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:30,270
Please contact me. 010-3109-313.

75
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:34,060
Missing Persons Family blog?

76
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:38,630
It doesn't say it's the Donggnag mummy, but the fact that the wedding ring was found,

77
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:42,050
as well as  Wuthering Heights , it's obviously the Donggang mummy.

78
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:46,050
Articles with a link to the post keep popping up that there have been so many replies being posted with tips.

79
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:49,120
Who's the one that posted it on the blog?

80
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,790
You should be able to find out when you call them. This is the phone number.

81
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:13,360
Is Miss Jeong Sa Bin there?

82
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:19,490
She said she was going to be at the Seoyeon University research center until late. What's the matter?

83
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:29,050
Oh, formaldeâ€” I mean, Prosecutor Kim Soo Hyeok.

84
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:31,360
- What brings you here? 
 - Let's talk.

85
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:35,390
- What about? 
 - Weren't you supposed to send me the facial restoration first?

86
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:37,620
Oh...

87
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:39,200
Oh?

88
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:44,390
I told you Byeon Seong Hoon will crawl out again without those remains. Is that what you want?

89
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:48,620
Do you really want to witness him killing someone?

90
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:52,490
 What? The professor must have a boyfriend. Who's that? 

91
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,940
Why are you going this far?

92
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:06,090
That's what I want to ask you, Prosecutor.

93
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:09,670
Byeon Seong Hoon only needs to pay for the crimes he's committed.

94
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:13,400
Why do you have to manipulate remains that he's not responsible for?

95
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:19,270
I'll explain it in a non-malicious way.

96
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:22,780
Since he isn't being punished for the crimes he's committed.

97
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:27,790
After getting released after doing time for his crimes, he commits the same crime again!

98
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:30,490
If punks like him were locked up in prison from the start,

99
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:35,350
discussions like this wouldn't be necessary, nor would there be a reason to manipulate.

100
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:36,520
Happy now?

101
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,700
What if he changes?

102
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:44,570
What if he lives without committing the same crime? What if he lives differently?

103
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:53,470
Please get in the car first.

104
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:05,160
Hello, Prosecutor Kim Soo Hyeok.

105
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:10,640
Thanks for remembering my name, but I don't have time to chitchat with you.

106
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,270
When did you two...

107
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:15,820
I guess he needs you to manipulate evidence.

108
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:19,430
If not, is there a reason for him to see you in private?

109
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:20,930
In private? What are you talking about?

110
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:24,200
There is a reason to see her in private, so please stay out of it.

111
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,730
Do you trust anything he says?

112
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:32,230
You know full well he kills people by manipulating murder cases.

113
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:33,920
What?

114
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:39,340
Hey, my books.

115
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:45,590
Whether public or private, I don't think she has anything to talk about with a suspect in a murder case.

116
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:48,620
Suspect in a murder case?

117
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:57,890
Fine. Let's go talk somewhere.

118
00:11:57,890 --> 00:12:01,770
It's my issue, I'll deal with it. Don't worry.

119
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:49,300
Look.

120
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:53,300
Don't get too close to Cheon Jong Beom.

121
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:56,380
I'm a prosecutor. I only deal with bad people.

122
00:12:56,380 --> 00:13:00,640
I can tell just by looking into their eyes what kind of people they are.

123
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:05,260
Whether it's someone who'd stab a person in the stomach with a fillet knife or someone who'll wear an ankle bracelet.

124
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:08,160
But do you know what kind of punks can never be rehabilitated?

125
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,270
Psychopaths.

126
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:15,930
Here. Someone who's rotten in here. Understand?

127
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:25,290
Why do you make your own conclusions about people and brand them that way?

128
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:30,460
I met Jong Beom before you did.

129
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:33,360
So how much do you know about him?

130
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,750
I don't know him well.

131
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:37,590
But I will get to know him.

132
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:42,350
Whether he's good or bad, I'll get to know him myself.

133
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:57,610
Where is your house?

134
00:13:57,610 --> 00:13:58,620
What did you say?

135
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:02,570
I don't want to waste my breath on someone who protects the likes of him, so please get out.

136
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:08,570
Fine then. I can't stay here any longer either because of the smell of formaldehyde.

137
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:13,330
You said to get out.

138
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:16,320
I didn't tell you to get out here.

139
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:23,550
Seriously...

140
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:52,120
 Anger. But it hurts. 

141
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:04,200
You'll get into another accident driving this way.

142
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:09,180
Don't get distracted when you're driving; concentrate.

143
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:13,840
I'll get out here. I have things to get at the supermarket here.

144
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:16,120
How old are you?

145
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:20,330
Thirty-two. Why?

146
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:23,840
You seem like someone who starts out by not listening to others.

147
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:28,730
It's fine if you want to dig your own grave, but what did those around you do wrong?

148
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:33,390
It's my life.

149
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:56,390
Honey! I'm almost home.

150
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:58,300
You came out to meet me?

151
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:01,730
Where are you? Where could you be?

152
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:06,940
Mister, come on!

153
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:10,230
Do you know what kind of world we live in for you to be going around drunk?

154
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:12,060
Please get it together, okay?

155
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:16,310
Get it together? Who do you think you are?

156
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:51,800
â™«   In my dream... In my dream, I saw yesterday   â™«

157
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:58,560
â™«   You whose name I do not know but whom I cannot forget   â™«

158
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:06,880
â™«   One I've never seen and whose name I do not know   â™«

159
00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:14,390
â™«   My lover who grazes by my past dream   â™«

160
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:23,110
â™«   I think thoroughly tonight   â™«

161
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:29,020
â™«   You were that familiar image I may have seen somewhere   â™«

162
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:37,310
â™«   The image of love I had forgotten   â™«

163
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:44,720
â™«   My lover, I'd seen some year ago   â™«

164
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:08,760
 Dad told me he would recognize Gong Ji Cheol's eyes. 

165
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:16,420
 February 15th, 1988. 

166
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:21,540
 Dad first saw Gong Ji Cheol at the first prison he was assigned to. 

167
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:27,170
 May 31, 1988. The day Mom gave birth to me, 

168
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:31,390
 five minutes before Dad heard that Mom went to the hospital, 

169
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:35,760
 he was randomly chosen as one of Gong Ji Cheol's executioners. 

170
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:41,050
 Gong Ji Cheol's execution. 

171
00:18:41,050 --> 00:18:44,970
 Why did that have to be my dad? 

172
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:46,850
 Why? 

173
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:46,380
Your father's symptoms keep getting more serious.

174
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:49,760
He seems to have ringing in his ears as well.

175
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:54,280
He seems to believe that the death-row inmate Gong Ji Cheol is still alive.

176
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:56,120
He sees apparitions.

177
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:59,970
He seems to think that the apparition of Gong Ji Cheol is going to hurt his daughter.

178
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:08,050
Dad, Gong Ji Cheol is dead.

179
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:11,340
You said you pressed the push-button for his hanging.

180
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:14,700
He can never harm you or me.

181
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:20,790
No... that bastard will come.

182
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:22,350
He will find you.

183
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:24,490
Dad.

184
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:28,670
Run away. Run.

185
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:30,990
Please run away.

186
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:33,170
Run away...

187
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,240
 Proceed. 

188
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:54,820
 One, two, three. 

189
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:58,250
 One, two, three. 

190
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:02,980
 At that time, I pressed the push button first among the three guards. 

191
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:06,040
 Gong Gi Cheol died by my hands. 

192
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:13,780
 That guy... 

193
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:17,430
 He moved. He must still be alive. 

194
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:24,760
 It will be difficult for you since it's your first time. After your first execution, you feel like this for a few days. 

195
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:36,960
 The prosecutor told me that Jeong Ha Eun, she's still alive. 

196
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:41,920
 Can't I just check once myself? 

197
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:46,030
 What do you mean resurrect? Is he Jesus? 

198
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:48,500
 What do you need to check so badly that you're being this desperate? 

199
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:51,920
 I saw him move! 

200
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:54,810
 He did look too handsome to just get buried this way. 

201
00:21:54,810 --> 00:21:58,130
 This man, seriously! Excuse me! 

202
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:12,590
Please go get someone.

203
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:14,510
Please run away.

204
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:15,790
Please run away!

205
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:19,510
Dad... It's okay.

206
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:21,370
It's okay, I told you.

207
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:24,150
Please run away.

208
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:30,190
    

209
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:36,790
 President Baek In Seok is who's behind Seo Tae Ha. 

210
00:22:56,120 --> 00:23:02,330
Are you the prosecutor who's known to carry out cruel investigations in the age of scientific investigation?

211
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:05,400
Ah, listen to this bastard's way with words.

212
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:10,520
Illegal debt collection, extortion, assault, drug smuggling, charges of election law violation.

213
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:13,140
Are you building your resume with these charges?

214
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:15,310
How is it inside?

215
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:21,590
Bastard, you look comfortable. You want me to let you live there for the rest of your life?

216
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:25,660
Take your hands off Byeon Seong Hoon. Then I'll get you out within five years.

217
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:31,750
Too bad. I know a certain old man, so I think I'll be out next week.

218
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:33,360
Speak formally.

219
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:37,670
Thank you for your goodwill, though, Prosecutor Kim Soo Hyeok.

220
00:23:37,670 --> 00:23:41,010
What's the use in getting out when I'll be bringing you back here?

221
00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:46,970
From then on, it's solitary confinement. Cell phone,  preference, visitations, special pardons are all out of the question.

222
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:49,950
Since I'll be managing you personally.

223
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:53,910
I wasn't going to say this,

224
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:59,790
but haven't you heard of a gangster who's saved President Baek In Seok's life many times?

225
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:03,900
That president of yours sent a New Year's present to his future son-in-law.

226
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:07,490
But he just forwarded me the wine that he received as a present.

227
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:16,560
Here. Can you see it?

228
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:23,130
Even your handwriting sucks.

229
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:32,710
I have a few cards up my sleeve besides President Baek In Seok.

230
00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:37,510
So you're saying you'll keep protecting Byeon Seong Hoon?

231
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,520
Do you think I'd do such a thing?

232
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:06,050
Your client Oh Chang Soon is a two-time offender for assault.

233
00:25:06,050 --> 00:25:09,460
Do you want me to make him a 13-time offender?

234
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:12,970
I hear he has gout and arthritis now that he's older.

235
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:20,850
No. I can just make Oh Chang Soon into a serial murderer by manipulating the remains.

236
00:25:25,330 --> 00:25:30,780
Do you know that the blood of a murderer flows through your veins?

237
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:37,160
Worry about your own veins, bastard.

238
00:25:40,390 --> 00:25:47,150
â™ª Since the beginning â™ª

239
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:50,970
â™ª you were never mine â™ª

240
00:26:25,870 --> 00:26:30,000
Hey, from now on, this thread...

241
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:34,230
will go into your nose and back out of your mouth.

242
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:36,240
You've done this before, haven't you?

243
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:41,320
It's a special service for those who bother women.

244
00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:48,920
Swallow.

245
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,830
That's it.

246
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:56,660
   

247
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:17,900
Tell me all seven places where you hid the corpses.

248
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:21,960
If you're wrong about the places you tell me now, you'll suffer this again tomorrow.

249
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:24,900
Today, it was two, but tomorrow, it'll be four.

250
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:28,830
If you're wrong again tomorrow, the day after will be eight.

251
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:32,760
Why are you doing this?

252
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:35,490
There's something I need to protect, too.

253
00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:39,930
Until I get out, it'll double every day. Got it?

254
00:27:42,550 --> 00:27:44,730
Why aren't you answering?

255
00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:50,950
There's no one on your side within these prison walls.

256
00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:55,660
Don't forget I hired your lawyer for you.

257
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:07,410
I'll tell you. I'll tell you everything.

258
00:28:07,410 --> 00:28:11,290
Please spare me.

259
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:12,780
- Write it down. 
 - Yes.

260
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:16,750
Please at least spare my life.

261
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:20,670
Tell me.

262
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,310
Let's move the remains.

263
00:29:27,650 --> 00:29:30,690
We've searched for half the day, but we've got nothing.

264
00:29:30,690 --> 00:29:36,830
Six was right, but on the very last one, Byeon Seong Hoon is screwing us over.

265
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:41,400
There's one more place.

266
00:29:44,010 --> 00:29:45,860
Move!

267
00:29:54,690 --> 00:29:56,680
What's going on?

268
00:29:56,680 --> 00:30:00,040
There's a chance that Byeon Seong Hoon's buried his victim's corpse on your grounds.

269
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,760
Corpse?

270
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:04,570
That makes no sense. This is a place of worship.

271
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:08,410
Father, a person has died.

272
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:11,780
Go up and search!

273
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:19,250
Prosecutor, Byeon Seong Hoon gets rid of his victims by chopping them up.

274
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:22,250
Why would he bury someone where it gets so much foot traffic?

275
00:30:22,250 --> 00:30:24,150
You never know.

276
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:29,380
 This way! Let's go up here. 

277
00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:32,000
Over there.

278
00:30:34,190 --> 00:30:35,810
Dig.

279
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,740
- It's here! 
 - Yes, sir.

280
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:09,860
Dig here first.

281
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:14,980

283
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:24,940
   

284
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:26,780
 You think I killed that baby? 

285
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:28,540
 Why did you ring Im Hwa Yeong's neighbor's doorbell? 

286
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:30,590
 Is Gong Ji Cheol alive? 

287
00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:33,620
 Before that, I think I'll find you first. 

288
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:38,410
 Gong Ji Cheol couldn't kill the one he loved. Who would he want to kill right now? 

289
00:32:38,410 --> 00:32:40,530
 Don't come any closer. 

290
00:32:40,530 --> 00:32:42,640
 Why do you always get angry when you worry about me? 

291
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:46,540
 The ill-fated will meet again in order to untie the knots. 

292
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:50,650
 I sometimes get confused when I see you.
