Excuse me. The book...

00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:45,070
   

12
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:50,220
It seems you're really interested in corpses.

13
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:55,260
This is the book that I ordered.

14
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:58,380
It's a limited edition with the author's real autograph.

15
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:04,150
I ordered this book for him to come and sign at 3:00 today.

16
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:07,110
It's 3:15.

17
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:10,780
Oh, please. This is a book I really need.

21
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:35,000
Well, do you want to buy mine?

22
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,900
You scribbled in it, just a minute ago.

23
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:38,480
I'll give it to you used.

24
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,920
Used?

25
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,830
If you don't want it, then give it up.

26
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:51,420
But... it looks like you have a habit of pressing down on that fountain pen.

27
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:53,680
The nib will wear out really quickly.

28
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,050
I think it's a better habit than spilling coffee on books.

29
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:06,060
I thought you weren't coming... I'm sorry.

30
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:10,950
Why would someone who's emigrating want that book?

31
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:16,780
Why do you think that person's departure date is exactly tomorrow morning?

32
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:21,410
Isn't it fate that this person wouldn't get this book?

33
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:27,160
I guess it's the sad fate of that person who values the author's own autograph more than a million dollars!

34
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:52,590
- I'm sorry. 
 - Oh, yes.

♫  Now I don't know them anymore  ♫

39
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:24,910
 They say that fated lovers will never be apart. 

40
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:27,510
 Though we don't know when or where, 

41
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:30,020
 we will meet again, 

42
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:37,350
 even in the next life and again in the life after.

 How I envy this. Jeong Ha Eun, who dreams of a fated love,  

45
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,850
 are you listening? 

46
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:54,580
 I will play the song you've requested. Lee Moon Sae's "If Love Passes."

52
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:24,370
Miss, you shouldn't carry that around. That yellow umbrella.

53
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:27,990
Don't you know there's a crazy bastard who only kills women with yellow umbrellas?

54
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:30,080
Haven't you heard?

55
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,660
Wo... men?
 (T/N: North Korean word) 

56
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,990
I'm not a spy.

57
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:39,020
I defected to South Korea.

58
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:43,010
There are so many bastards that kill women in South Korea!

59
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:47,410
Those kinds of bastards should all just be buried somewhere!

60
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:49,820
Don't you think so?

61
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:54,440
They'll all get caught. My boyfriend is a detective.

62
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,700
 - Oh my goodness. 
 - What's going on! 

63
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:03,180
Those eyes have seen hell.

64
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:07,060
Wow, this is the first time this has ever happened.

65
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:09,030
Look! Look here, Detective Cha.

66
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:13,300
Here. The chest. From this side, twice.

67
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:16,080
Then double. From here, once like this!

68
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,320
And then from the other side, once like this!

69
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,250
And from here, he just went crazy.

70
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:23,620
Hey, move!

71
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:42,330
The body is damaged but the face is clean.

72
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:44,810
What could this be, Detective Cha?

73
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:46,710
It's two guys.

74
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:49,720
One guy killed her.

75
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,550
One guy buried her.

76
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,080
Oh!

77
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:07,620
We found a clue!

78
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:09,400
The culprit has long hair!

79
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:12,860
There aren't many men in Korea with long hair.

80
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:14,040
Nine.

81
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,600
Nine?

82
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:19,600
He killed nine people and then did nothing for two years.

83
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,370
Why would he start killing again?

84
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:27,990
In Do, do you think there is such a thing as murder without a motive?

85
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:32,430
How could someone kill another person without a motive?

86
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,290
Hey! Get out of here! Hey!

87
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:43,560
- Hey! Hey! You can't! 
 - Ah, it's strange!

88
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:46,760
Come here! Hey!

89
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:55,980
Are you all right?

90
00:06:55,980 --> 00:07:01,020
The one with a bad heart is your girlfriend. Why does this happen to you every so often?

91
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:04,000
With a heart of stone.

92
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:07,610
Let go. Let go! No!

93
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:12,700
   

94
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:27,840
 Between people who love each other, could their hearts be connected? 

95
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:34,200
"In the same moment I feel pain in my heart,

96
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:38,330
that person also feels pain.

97
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:43,720
It isn't my heart that hurts,

98
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,910
it's like a knife

99
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:48,430
is being stabbed in my heart."

100
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:54,300
Here. Right here.

101
00:07:55,200 --> 00:08:02,470
♫  Was it only just a misunderstanding?  ♫

102
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:11,000
♫  With a bright smile you look at me   ♫

103
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:20,170
♫  You made me into a fool   ♫

00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:29,580
♫  The day you left my side  ♫

106
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:36,000
You scared me!

107
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,380
I thought my heart was going to fall out of my chest.

108
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:38,590
Sorry, are you okay?

109
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:42,950
Are you okay? Try breathing. Can you breathe? Hurry up and take a breath in! Okay.

110
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,960
And let it out. Hurry!

111
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,570
This won't do. Let's go to the hospital. You're turning blue.

112
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:58,300
Are you a Smurf? Your face is bluer right now.

113
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:00,490
Do you always have to say that your heart is falling out of your chest?

114
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:05,230
A patient with a heart disease is saying her heart is falling out of her chest. It's sincere!

115
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:10,060
You can't use this.

116
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:13,620
Throw it away. Let's go.

117
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:19,060
Mine's not just any yellow umbrella. It's a baby dragon umbrella.

118
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:42,710
   

119
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:51,730
“If all else perished and he remained, I should still continue to be.

120
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:54,160
Whatever our souls are made of—"

121
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,950
"His and mine are the same.”

122
00:09:56,950 --> 00:09:58,430
Emily Bronte.

123
00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:01,640
Wuthering Heights. Page 123.

124
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,540
Hey! Really—

125
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:14,340
Should we throw away this ladder, too?

126
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:16,940
Hey-Hey!

127
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:22,330
It's page 73. I read it to you so often and you still forget.

128
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:27,390
Really?

129
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:30,490
Whatever the case, open it. To page 123.

130
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:33,590
Why page 123?

131
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:38,710
What is this? You already found 73 so easily, too.

132
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:42,410
 Will you be my wife, Jeong Ha Eun? 

133
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:47,790
I told you that customers won't buy it when you scribble in books.

134
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:52,250
I'm not sure if that's something a used bookstore owner should say.

135
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:58,400
You said that the scribbles in books are a part of their history. And that isn't a scribble. It's a proposal.

136
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:05,600
I waited a month for your answer.

137
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:11,720
Okay. Then I'll answer you through a scribble.

138
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:14,330
Look for my answer when I'm not here.

139
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:17,180
You're going to have to write a lot. I wrote them all down.

140
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:19,360
Every book in your bookstore.

141
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,070
What?

142
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:47,400
Then... I'll answer now.

143
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,280
I reject your proposal.

144
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,000
What?

145
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,580
I don't believe in love.

146
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:57,890
"Love Story" came out with a sequel. In the sequel, he loved a different girl...

147
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:02,410
Well, one more year.

148
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:07,890
If my heart beats for one more year, we can get married.

149
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:12,870
You've been rejecting me for four years now. This time it won't work.

150
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:13,770
Hey, Cha Hyeong Bin.

151
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:17,340
Don't say it. I know your next line.

152
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:20,740
We're... not fated to be a married couple.

153
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,590
Then, what are we?

154
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:24,960
Lovers.

155
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:27,850
A lover that you miss even if you're looking at them.

156
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:34,440
A relationship where we can always feel each other. A relationship where we will be together even in death.

157
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:40,200
That's you and me.

158
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,720
Then I don't want to be lovers.

159
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,320
I'm going to be lovers with you forever.

160
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,680
You can get married to a different girl.

161
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:53,740
I don't want to embrace your body but your soul.

162
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:56,840
I don't.

163
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:03,940
I've never looked at another girl like this before.

164
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:07,020
I want to touch your face and hold you as I fall asleep.

165
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:09,710
♫  Still you are   ♫

166
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:14,300
I want to see you when you fall asleep, when you open your eyes, when you feel pain,

167
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:19,740
when you cry, in my arms.

168
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:24,700
What if I die in your arms? Is that okay with you?

169
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:32,440
♫  feel so deeply   ♫

170
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:38,750
I'm happy even just looking at you like this.

171
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:39,650
♫  that is love   ♫

172
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:45,150
When you die, I'll be happy because I'm your husband;

173
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,320
and when you die,

174
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:53,780
I'll think about that moment for the rest of my life.

175
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:55,620
Please stop.

176
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:58,880
I really hate this kind of melodrama.

177
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:10,110
I told you I don't like these because it feels stuffy.

178
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:13,620
I could start a business with all the gloves you've bought me.

179
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:16,620
It's because I can't walk you home. I got an emergency call.

180
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:19,740
Why? Because of that yellow umbrella guy?

181
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:22,920
That bastard. He really evades Detective Cha Hyeong Bin so well.

182
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:26,030
He's going to die if he gets caught.

183
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:28,020
You know you can't run, right?

184
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:30,470
Stick to the wide roads. Don't go anywhere without street lamps.

185
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:32,380
I know your short cut very well.

186
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:34,750
You'll get in trouble. When you get home, check all the locks—

187
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:39,550
Oh my— Your nagging has started. I have to run.

188
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:56,800
When you were screaming earlier, you were imitating that girl's scream. Weren't you?

189
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,030
Yeah.

190
00:17:58,030 --> 00:18:01,050
You heard that dead girl's scream, yesterday.

191
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:06,360
You saw the guy who left the yellow umbrella. That guy's face! Right?

192
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,560
This woman has the mind of a seven-year-old.

193
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:17,650
Come here, little kid.

194
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:20,800
Let's do something fun with this man.

195
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:25,000
This man who looks sharp as a razor blade.

196
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,780
If you really get to know him, he's really not such a bad man.

197
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:30,860
- It's okay, it's okay. 
 - You're the one who looks old.

198
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:34,430
Hey. Who would think you're 23?

199
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:39,660
I told you this face has passed down generation after generation in my family.

200
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:42,040
This kind of face doesn't age.

201
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:46,120
Look at me in 30 years. My face will be exactly the same.

202
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,130
Come here, come here.

203
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:51,970
Come here. Let's sit here.

204
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:56,200
What you saw yesterday on the mountain... can you draw it?

205
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:45,410
   

206
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:50,800
Let's just go eat.

207
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,480
It's fine. You should eat before you go.

208
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:00,200
Let's order fried rice for this woman. I want jjamppong  (spicy seafood soup) .

209
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:03,850
   

210
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:09,550
I said it's fine.

211
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:14,400

00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:43,150
   

213
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:58,650
   

214
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:06,990
   

215
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:55,490
Wait!  What is that young man doing over there?

216
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:26,590
Why are you...

217
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:30,860
leaving umbrellas at my house?

218
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:37,950
I'm hurt. I don't think I can keep painting.

219
00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:41,550
Was that it?

220
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:45,120
Because you can't paint anymore... is that why you started again?

221
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,850
You're suffering a lot because of me.

222
00:23:47,850 --> 00:23:51,880
Don't worry. This time, I'll stop for a while.

223
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:54,850
It's all thanks to you.

224
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:55,820
Thanks to me?

225
00:23:55,820 --> 00:24:01,720
Because you put socks on those white feet,

226
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:06,570
it seemed like... at her point of death,

227
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:12,020
that filthy wench looked like the Virgin Mary.

228
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:13,960
What?

229
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:16,220
This time, this wench...

230
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:19,480
She looks like your mom who abandoned you.

231
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:26,190
The wench before that... she looked just like your stepmother who did that to your eyes.

232
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:31,590
Why are you dragging me into this?

233
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,550
You killed them because you wanted to kill them.

234
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:37,790
Should we have dinner together, son?

235
00:24:53,890 --> 00:24:56,970
   

236
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:01,620
   

237
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:26,660
You will certainly commit murder.

238
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:31,020
Once you start, you can't stop.

239
00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:37,230
How...

240
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:39,450
How could you do this to me...

241
00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:42,160
Don't fight it, just accept it.

242
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:44,980
Just bring the demon onto your side.

243
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:50,350
Draw inspiration from the demon and paint. Like me.

244
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:14,520
You got my blood but not my talent.

245
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:20,960
You have to murder in order to find freedom. I was the same way.

246
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:27,310
Do you think I enjoy murder? I do it because I can't help it.

247
00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:31,090
But once you start,

248
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:35,040
you'll never be able to stop.

249
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:38,380
This time the girl I killed,

250
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:43,730
she was a wench that kept her sick father locked up and starved.

251
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:50,810
If that wench had lived, that wench's father would have died.

252
00:26:50,810 --> 00:26:55,920
Didn't I save an innocent person by killing that wench?

253
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,690
I'm different from you.

254
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:09,780
You've never loved a woman before.

255
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:16,380
Love. You love a woman?

256
00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:27,400
When other kids cut colored papers with scissors, you were stabbed in the eye with these by a woman.

257
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:32,590
But you think you love a woman?

258
00:27:35,770 --> 00:27:39,570
Even if you don't kill her, she's going to die soon.

259
00:27:39,570 --> 00:27:43,560
If you want, I can send her off comfortably.

260
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:06,770
Love.
