1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:06,330
     

2
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:16,560
     

3
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:29,040
Dad, Park Do Seong is the murderer who killed the milk delivery woman, isn't he?

4
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:31,600
You're going to punish him with a life sentence, aren't you?

5
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,670
You said you wanted to be a judge like me, right, Soo Hyeok?

6
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:39,410
Yes!

7
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:46,940
That coffee was brewed for 12 hours, drop by drop.

8
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:49,060
A judge must think slowly.

9
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:54,640
Is the accused really a criminal and does he deserve punishment?

10
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,790
Is there even an ounce of unfairness in his life?

11
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:04,490
This is not a matter of beasts, it's a matter of human beings.

12
00:01:04,490 --> 00:01:07,750
What if Park Do Seong kills again once he gets out?

13
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:12,580
I saw Park Do Seong's eyes looking at me during the trial.

14
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:18,700
I have faith in human beings.

15
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:19,800
   

16
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:20,850
   

17
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:22,870
   

18
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:25,270
   

19
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:28,960
Dad.

20
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,480
 At 2:00 this morning, 

21
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:34,800
 the very first place the milk-delivery murder culprit, Mr. Park, went to after his release was 

22
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:38,680
 the 78-year-old Mr. Choi's home in Sillim-dong. 

23
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:43,410
 Mr. Park killed Mr. Choi, who gave a witness statement at his trial four years ago, 

24
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:49,000
  and Mr. Choi's granddaughter, Ms. Lee, with a deadly weapon and set fire to his home. 

25
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,350
  Ms. Lee was less than three months old, 

26
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:56,080
 and Mr. Park admitted he killed her because he didn't want to hear her crying. 

27
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,750
 Furthermore, it came to light that at the trial four years ago, 

28
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:02,640
 he only got a four-year sentence due to the court's acknowledgement that he suffered from a personality disorder 

29
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,440
  as well as mental deficiency due to alcohol dependence, 

30
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:10,580
 and criticism of Judge Kim Hyeong Seok, who heard the case, has been mounting. 

31
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:14,010
 Mental deficiency refers to a condition in which the afflicted person is incapable of distinguishing matters 

32
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:19,820
 and unable to make decisions. Prior to the murder, 

33
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:22,420
 Mr. Park was in treatment for alcoholism for three months 

34
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:25,860
 and was diagnosed with mental deficiency during the trial. 

35
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:30,350
  That was not a matter of a human, it was a matter of a beast.  

36
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:34,720
 Dad shouldn't have let his guard down... 

37
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,210
 to that savage bastard. 

38
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:40,600
   

39
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:49,010
 Timing and Subtitles by the Reborn Team @ viki 

40
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:57,250
How can you still be smiling like that?

41
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:03,760
When, as I live, I can't forgive him?

42
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:22,430
     

43
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:44,230
A polaroid?

44
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:57,640
I guess people who take immunosuppressants don't think about weakened immunity.

45
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:02,790
The cut has become infected. It's swollen and inflamed.

46
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:05,390
You didn't take any antibiotics, did you?

47
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:11,060
Well... I think a medical school professor shouldn't hear such things from a medical school student...

48
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:17,820
I think you're good at seeing someone else's wound but not good at seeing your own wound.

49
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:25,630
The cut might leave a scar. Disinfect it every day for at least a week.

50
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:29,470
Use this three times a day.

51
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:33,880
And this one, twice per day.

52
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:36,020
Make sure you take it.

53
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,860
It's a snow scene.

54
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:48,930
Why are there only two men there? It looks lonely.

55
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:52,990
James Tissot's Old Testament artwork left an impression on me, so I painted it.

56
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:55,620
Cain and Abel.

57
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:57,860
So you also get inspiration from the Bible.

58
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:00,140
I've just been curious ever since I was young.

59
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:05,330
My grandfather was a pastor. I asked him questions constantly to the point of annoyance.

60
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:11,380
Why did God abandon Cain and choose Abel?

61
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:16,700
In the end, Cain became the first murderer ever.

62
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:42,980
How scared would he have been?

63
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:45,390
He must've regretted killing him.

64
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:49,310
He would've realized that his father hadn't abandoned him,

65
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:53,900
and that he loved his younger brother.

66
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:55,370
The moment he killed him.

67
00:05:55,370 --> 00:06:01,410
You're worried about the person that killed, and not the person that died?

68
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:05,260
Regret is a terrible feeling.

69
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:10,260
The yearning, sorrow, and sadness...

70
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:13,910
There are times that all of those feelings surge up together.

71
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:22,000
Regret is a feeling that a person can only have for someone they love.

72
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:27,810
 I wanted to know everything... 

73
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:29,950
 about this woman. 

74
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:34,540
♫ Keep bop, we bop, I bop, you bop

75
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:38,660
Can I... have that sushi roll I ate last time again?

76
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:40,380
Of course!

77
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:42,130
You're our Sa Bin's student.

78
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:44,740
Yes, have a seat! Sit right there!

79
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:48,430
I'll make it quick.

80
00:06:57,970 --> 00:07:02,810
I read in a magazine article that Professor Jeong received her heart from a death-row convict.

81
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:08,470
Ah, that!  There was a death-row convict called Kim Sa Hyeon who killed his wife and his own kids.

82
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:12,630
Kim Sa Hyeon hanged himself in prison.

83
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:16,810
Sa Bin's father saved him many times, whenever he did.

84
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:20,400
That created a connection, and he ended up giving his heart to Sa Bin.

85
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:24,900
But Kim Sa Hyeon met Sa Bin just once, before he died.

86
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:29,530
I heard from Sa Bin that he cried so much saying he regretted it.

87
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:33,860
You can't wash the blood from killing your family off your hands

88
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:37,150
even with all the water of the Pacific Ocean.

89
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:40,400
Right.  You understand that feeling the best.

90
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:45,130
Since you went around with a fish filet knife filled with determination trying to find your cheating wife.

91
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:48,200
You punk!  Are you peeling apples with your foot?

92
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,130
Give it to me.

93
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:55,230
That's why I boiled Sa Bin's milk bottle

94
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:59,710
and changed her diapers and diligently reflected on my mistakes.

95
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:04,370
That's nothing! When Sa Bin was in school, I helped direct traffic

96
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:07,300
at the crosswalk,

97
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:09,720
and attended her career counseling!

98
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:14,360
Hah! You acted like a leader among those mothers!

99
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:17,060
Did you sell medicine with that snake tongue of yours?

100
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:18,710
Snake?

101
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:23,420
That's right. I can sell my country and my soul as well.  What couldn't I sell?

102
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:28,800
I need money in order to send my brother to a comfortable nursing home.

103
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:34,010
Our Sa Bin? What if she suffers a relapse in her heart?

104
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:39,510
When I think about that, I can't sleep. What do you want?

105
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:43,520
Do you have money?! You have nothing! How dare you?

106
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:46,340
I have money!  How much do you need?

107
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:47,800
Like ₩20,000  (about $16) ?

108
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:51,290
I couldn't even pay you this month. How would you have any money?

109
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:59,610

 Remains Maniac who is going to NFS after eating a meal although it's a weekend, when are you going to play with me? 

124
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,850
What are you looking for?

125
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:32,750
I kept wondering if it was true, but my diary...

126
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:35,150
is really not here.

127
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:38,190
Your diary? Your analog item number 14?

128
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:42,260
School, the autopsy lab, my uncles' store, my dad's hospital... I've looked everywhere and it's gone.

129
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:45,610
Did you leave your credit card in your diary?

130
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:51,030
It's not worth anything for someone to steal! Just wait, someone will return it to you.

131
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:55,810
I feel like I'm being dissected alive when I think about someone reading my diary.

132
00:10:55,810 --> 00:11:00,810
Oh my, oh my, oh my!

133
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:06,210
- Yeah? 
 - Can I see a corpse today?

134
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:07,680
Corpse?

135
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:12,350
You said an intern would have three chances to participate in the NFS before. Today seems like the right time.

136
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:16,710
Oh... today? The evening autopsy...

137
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:21,540
There will be an autopsy of remains from Busan, but it's at 11:00 p.m. Is that okay?

138
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:23,780
Of course. See you then, Senior.

139
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:26,930
  What? Senior? Hey, what makes me your senior?  

140
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:30,430
Well, I'll be working with you at the National Forensic Service in five years, so isn't "senior" the right term?

141
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:33,940
I'll buy snacks to bring, the ones you like.

142

 Her blood type: AB. 

143

 Her favorite season: spring.  Her favorite things: sand watch, compass. 

144
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:55,150
 2G phone: used until last year. 

145
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:58,690
 Her favorite fruit: grapefruit, unfortunately. 

146
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:02,600
 Her method of relieving stress: eating old types of snacks. 

147
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:06,020
 Her favorite place: Dongmyo ("East Shrine" in metropolitan Seoul, completed 1601). 

148
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:10,630
 Her impossible bucket list item: riding a rollercoaster. 

149
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:15,260
 Her favorite sound: the sound of a fountain pen. 

150

  Song she likes, "In Dreams."  

151

00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,990
Prosecutor Kim Soo Hyeok.

153
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:17,740
 Soo Hyeok, why are you looking at me like that? 

154
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:21,730
Soo Hyeok, why are you looking at me like that?

155
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:26,350
Why? Do you not like it?

156
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:29,610
No.

157
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:34,060
- Instead of a tiara, how about something like a flower crown? 
 - Flower crown?

158
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:37,310
I think you would look great in a wedding collar as well.

159
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:39,580
How do you think about using gardenia or white parrot tulips?

160
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:44,170
Give me something wintry that feels like Christmas, like Cymbidiums.  (T/N: commonly called "boat orchids") 

161
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:48,680
No. Just a flower crown, something like purple wildflowers.

162
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:53,380
Wildflowers? Are you saying wildflowers suit me?

163
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:02,550
You know there'll be a fundraiser for the law society next week, don't you?

164
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:05,270
Yes, I heard from the chief prosecutor.

165
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:08,060
Go back with your mother for today. I have to go to the office.

166
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:10,100
But it's Saturday.

167
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:12,940
I'll leave her in your care.

168
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:22,970
Do you think he looks like a groom who's about to get married?

169
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:25,550
It doesn't matter. Because he's mine now.

170
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:29,100
I'll make him pay me in love forever for what he owes me in dating.

171
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,910
Love?

172
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:36,980
If you give him your love but he doesn't give his, your love will become an obsession.

173
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:40,870
Well, it's your life. I guess you'll handle it.

174
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:44,240
Mom, you're being jealous of me right now, aren't you?

175
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:49,270
You've never met a man who makes you anxious, hungry, and crazy.

176
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:56,500
It's okay to go crazy, just as long as you return to your place.

177
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:02,830
Prosecutor!  Im Hwa Yeong's murder has been caught.

178
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:08,970
You know Heo Do Jin, don't you?  The guy who held up an old woman at the Mapo intersection and fled not long ago.

179
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:13,640
On Heo Do Jin's left wrist,

180
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:16,460
the woman's nail marks were found.

181
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:20,370
Heo Do Jin's DNA was found on the skin under Im Hwa Yeong's fingernails.

182
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:23,990
Fingernails. Heo Do Jin's DNA.

183
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:32,090
A guy who brandished a knife on the street holding up a random person set up a yellow umbrella in the bathtub?

184
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:36,710
Who is that stupid detective who arrested Heo Do Jin?

185
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:40,780
His name is Goo Hyeol Gi. Do you know the vampire of Gwanik Station?

186
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:45,900
He came in first at the mixed martial arts competition held by the National Police Agency and then became a detective.

187
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:47,100
   

188
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,220
Oh my goodness!

189
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:52,930
Did you arrest Heo Do Jin?

190
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:55,920
What is with this arbitrary action? I never ordered that.

191
00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:00,730
I arrested him after the Chief Prosecutor called and told me it was your order.

192
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:04,370
That you have to be careful these days because you're the subject of an internal investigation at the Prosecution Office.

193
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:07,150
From now on, don't do anything without hearing from me directly.

194
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:11,990
I'm going to the NFS at 11:00, so bring the documents showing proof of your fabrication.

195
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:19,170
Oh, Prosecutor! Seo Tae Ha has been released!

196
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:21,700
You'll have to be careful from now on.

197
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:26,310
That jerk is the one who should be careful since he's come back into my territory.

198
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:43,620
I'll make sure that Kim Soo Hyeok fully realizes your thoughts.

199
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:48,160
Don't hate the enemy. It will cloud your sound judgment.

200
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:52,780
For today, just go give your greetings for my release. But make him realize

201
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:58,080
that he can unexpectedly die pointlessly anywhere at any time.

202
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,940
Yes, Sir. I understand.

203
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:03,960
♪ Hello, Kim Soo Hyeok ♪

204
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:08,420
♪ Have you been well ♪

205
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,380
How refreshing.

206
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,140
Where are you?

207
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:27,630
I'm nearly there.

208
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:31,380
You know I can't get in without a pass, right? Where are you?

209
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:33,890
Right now, I'm at...

210
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:42,790
Prosecutor Kim Soo Hyeok?

211
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:45,970
Hang on for a bit.

212
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,900
I'll go to you. Where are you?

213
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:11,940
Oh, it's the basement parking garage.

214
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,550
No. Prosecutor!

215
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:26,640
Hello? Senior?

216
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:07,480
You sharpened the knife very well.

217
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:15,420
You should shut your mouth and open your eyes wide. Don't you see what's going to happen to you?

218
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:17,770
Get them!

219
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:23,270
What's this?

220
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:25,870
This has nothing to do with you, so move.

221
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:34,160
How long are you going to block my way?

222
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:18,680
Hey!

223
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:21,740
Bastard... You're going to pierce someone with those eyes.

224
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:24,160
Count yourselves lucky.

225
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:29,400
If not for me, you would have been mutilated by that bastard.

226
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:15,240
Why do you live dangerously like this? Did you see his eyes?

227
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:18,690
He came here to kill you today.

228
00:22:18,690 --> 00:22:22,900
Why do you make him hate you so much? He's not the only one who hates you.

229
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:26,260
Your enemies are everywhere!

230
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:29,540
Do you think that only puts you in danger? It puts your family in danger, too.

231
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:33,100
Don't you have anyone you want to protect?

232
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:35,380
A prosecutor should only fight with the law.

233
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:38,910
Are you a gangster or a black-belt holder? Do you think you can fight alone?

234
00:22:38,910 --> 00:22:42,820
I'm not a gangster, but I do have a black belt.

235
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:58,420
Why do you care if I get hurt or not?

236
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:03,110
Because I don't want the person I like to get hurt.

237
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:09,320
I like you. Because I like you, you mustn't ever get hurt.

238
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:12,090
Are you confessing right now?

239
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:17,400
That's right, I'm confessing. I realized it when you got hurt earlier.

240
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:21,640
That I didn't need any experiments.

241
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:36,550
Let's pretend I never heard it, that confession.

242
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:39,760
People are free to like who they want. It's up to me.

243
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,220
I have a woman I'm going to marry.

244
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:47,200
A woman... you're going to marry?

245
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:51,110
The invitations will go out soon. If you'd like, I'll send you one.

246
00:23:57,290 --> 00:24:03,330
He could have just told me he didn't like me. Why does he have to say something like that to reject me?

247
00:24:03,330 --> 00:24:06,530
Then, why did he shine the light for me when I was walking home?

248
00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:11,000
Why did he save me during the car accident?

249
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,890
Does that make any sense?

250
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:16,880
He's getting married...

251
00:24:54,930 --> 00:24:57,840
Here's the fabricated evidence.

252
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:03,840
You don't let others drive you.

253
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:09,570
Did he get rejected by a woman? What's with his expression?

254
00:26:39,290 --> 00:26:41,420
     

255
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:52,190
    

256
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:01,760
He made a classmate fall to her death?

257
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,970
Even drew a painting...

258
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:24,450
   
   

259
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:29,360
 My older brother is a second-year medical school student at Seoyeon University. 

260
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:34,750
 And I witnessed him commit murder eight years ago. 

261
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:37,890
   Congratulations on becoming the star of Seoyeon University, Brother. 

262
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:51,170
  I have a woman I'm going to marry  

263
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:54,180
I know, I know, I said I know.

264
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:58,420
But why won't that man get out of my head?

265
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:13,150
  It's the professor!  

266
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:16,580
  Professor! Professor!  

267
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:18,570
A murderer? Does that even make sense?

268
00:28:18,570 --> 00:28:20,970
- How can it be? 
 - Seriously!

269
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:23,380
Wow! Professor, what's wrong?

270
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:26,070
- Do you have an eye infection? 
 - Not at all.

271
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:30,780
Professor! Professor! This is seriously, really, goosebump-worthy.

272
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:33,410
They say there's a murderer in our medical school.

273
00:28:33,410 --> 00:28:36,770
- What? 
 - It's blowing up on social media right now!

274
00:28:36,770 --> 00:28:40,040
Oh, right. You don't use social media, do you?

275
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:46,450
Here it is.

276
00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:49,750
 My older brother is a second-year medical school student at Seoyeon University. 

277
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:53,850
 And I witnessed him commit murder eight years ago. 

278
00:28:53,850 --> 00:28:57,960
 On the rooftop of an abandoned building, he made a classmate fall to her death 

279
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:01,390
 and painted the girl as she died. 

280
00:29:01,390 --> 00:29:04,390
  My brother is really good at painting.  

281
00:29:04,390 --> 00:29:08,320
  I will never be able to forget what he looked like at that moment.  

282
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:12,960
 His face filled with lunacy. The reason I'm writing this post is  

283
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:17,460
 because I'm afraid I could be killed by my brother at any time 

284
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:22,100
 since he knows that I witnessed that incident. 

285
00:29:24,770 --> 00:29:28,790
If he's a second-year medical school student, he was 15, eight years ago.

286
00:29:28,790 --> 00:29:34,400
He killed at the age of 15... Doesn't that match the Cheon Jong Beom rumor too well?

287
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,370
No way!

288
00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:38,820
But does Cheon Jong Beom paint?

289
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:40,600
What are you doing over here?

290
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:47,460
Oh, Jong Beom, I kept you waiting yesterday, didn't I? 
Sorry. I didn't even call you.

291
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:51,220
You wouldn't have been able to. Because your phone is right here.

292
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:52,760
Oh, right. My phone.

293
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:54,610
Where did you find it?

294
00:29:54,610 --> 00:29:58,100
- I guess you don't look for anything once it's lost. 
 - What?

295
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:02,390
What happened to your face?

296
00:30:02,390 --> 00:30:04,200
Oh, this.

297
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:08,770
I'll let you know if you buy me something to eat.

298
00:30:08,770 --> 00:30:11,160
You haven't even eaten yet?

299
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:14,710
Okay, let's go. I'm also suddenly feeling hungry.

300
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:17,700
- Want to come with us? 
 - No! No, we should go.

301
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:19,960
- Goodbye! 
 - Goodbye!

302
00:30:23,670 --> 00:30:25,400
Let's go.

303
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:43,600
If you have something you want to ask me, you can ask now.

304
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,370
No, I don't.

305
00:30:45,370 --> 00:30:47,640
Let's eat.
