1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,520
   

2
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:09,280
It must seem like a miracle now,

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:12,080
but your condition can get worse again.

4
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:21,100
No, Doctor.

5
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:23,320
I learned this, this time.

6
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:25,660
If I have a strong purpose,

7
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:29,910
my heart will become that much stronger.

8
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:33,810
I'll live, no matter what.

9
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:37,800
I'm going to have kids with you and bother you and stay with you forever.

10
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:42,550
Are you... accepting my proposal now?

11
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:44,800
What timing...

12
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,650
Could I recommend a wedding hall for you?

13
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:54,400
There's a priest that I'm close to in a cathedral called Haebora in Samcheonpo.

14
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,910
Thank you, Doctor.

15
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,100
 - Detective Cha, where are you? Over.  
 - One second.

16
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:07,890
Answer it, I'm going to the bathroom.

17
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,340
I'm listening. Over.

18
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:15,740
 Detective Cha Hyeong Bin is totally my type! What a shame. 

19
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:19,300
 - He's marrying Patient Jeong Ha Eun. 
 - But did you know 

20
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:23,180
 that a different man was with Jeong Ha Eun in the emergency room the entire time? 

21
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:26,770
 Really? Then Jeong Ha Eun 

22
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:30,750
 - has another guy besides Detective Cha? 
 - But this isn't the first time. 

23
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:35,130
 Last time, that guy brought Jeong Ha Eun to the hospital in his arms. 

24
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:36,880
What are you talking about?

25
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,150
I'm asking what you're talking about.

26
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:48,150
The truth is when you came to the emergency room, it was a different person, not Detective Cha.

27
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:52,020
He stayed with you in the emergency room the entire time.

28
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:55,800
What?

29
00:01:55,800 --> 00:02:01,540
If he had been a murderer, he wouldn't have taken me, a witness to his murder, all the way to the hospital.

30
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:07,120
- And? 
 - What I saw wasn't him killing Yoon Jeong Hui.

31
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:10,850
It was after Yoon Jeong Hui had already died.

32
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:16,230
Gong Ji Cheol's eyes were full of fear. They weren't the eyes of a murderer.

33
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,940
I can't believe that he killed eleven people.

34
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,290
Ha Eun,

35
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:29,600
most girls get goosebumps from these kinds of stories.

36
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:33,930
That bastard murdered someone in front of you. He was always around you. Here.

37
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:38,340
He hid in corners like there and watched you. What do you think he was thinking about?

38
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:50,660
Look. He copied exactly what I wrote.

39
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:55,050
He said he wrote it himself and proudly confessed to it in front of me. Do you want to meet this kind of bastard?

40
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:57,880
He watched me and copied you.

41
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:02,700
It's scary and it gives me goosebumps.

42
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:06,280
But what if that's not it? What if he's not a murderer?

43
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:09,170
Hyeong Bin,

44
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:11,170
I'm going to meet him.

45
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:14,970
I'm going to meet him and if he's really the murderer, I'll testify.

46
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:23,290
Even if he gets a death sentence with your testimony, but if he escapes from prison, what are you going to do?

47
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:26,180
You saw how he killed women, right? With your own eyes.

48
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:30,690
If that bastard comes to kill you, you won't be able to get away. You think he doesn't know that you have a heart disease?

49
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,820
Hyeong Bin...

50
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:36,320
He's a bastard who kills people in order to eat well and sleep at night. That kind of bastard knows you.

51
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:39,280
And even that makes me feel like I'm going crazy but you—

52
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:53,310
Wow, he really left.

53
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:56,460
Hey, Cha Hyeong Bin! Hey!

54
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,590
Long time no see,

55
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:32,970
Gong Ji Cheol.

56
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:38,220
It's been four years, right? Since I saw you at the cathedral night school.

57
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,510
You look just like you did then.

58
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:50,770
Yoon Jeong Hui's murder

59
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:55,310
wasn't intentional, was it? It was an accident, wasn't it?

60
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:03,670
You aren't capable of murder.

61
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:11,880
What type of person...

62
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:15,310
is capable of murder?

63
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:19,260
You were reading a book even with bricks on your back.

64
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:23,380
When you were reading, do you know how your eyes looked?

65
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:27,790
You live only with one eye,

66
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:32,620
but you were shining more than people who live with both eyes.

67
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:39,330
You were the one who held my hand in the emergency room, weren't you?

68
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:44,150
When I fainted in the telephone booth,

69
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:48,190
you took me to the hospital.

70
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:53,040
Do you...

71
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:55,880
trust me?

72
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,810
I trust you.

73
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:02,930
Anyone who has called me their teacher

74
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:05,780
is someone that can live again.

75
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:11,980
Tell me everything that happened that day.

76
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:17,570
   

77
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,900
Yoon Jeong Hui had to die,

78
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:32,310
so that someone else could live.

79
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:39,020
- That's why I killed her. 
 - What are you saying?

80
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:42,570
Did you kill her intentionally?

81
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:45,700
- Yes. 
- Are you saying

82
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:48,070
that it wasn't an accident?

83
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:54,970
So now,

84
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:59,580
how do you feel now? Do you regret it?

85
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:02,490
If that moment came again,

86
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:05,900
I would...

87
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:09,290
kill her...

88
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:12,550
in the same way.

89
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:15,460
Why?

90
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:16,800
She was a bad person.

91
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,650
Is it okay to kill if they're bad people?

92
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:22,630
You kill one person

93
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:26,540
to save another?

94
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:29,250
Do you really think that makes any sense?

95
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:36,800
Who did you try to save by murdering someone else?

96
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:40,010
Who was it?

97
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:41,260
Do you want to know?

98
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:43,620
Do you think that person

99
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:49,000
would like that you killed someone for them?

100
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,430
If it had been me, I would be scared and creeped out.

101
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:56,510
Do you think that justifies your murder?

102
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,430
Murder...

103
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:08,010
is something a beast does.

104
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,280
You're not a person.

105
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,940
You chose the path of a beast.

106
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:17,550
If you don't regret that choice,

107
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:20,080
then you're already

108
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,580
a beast.

109
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:52,460
   

110
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:57,270
   

111
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:14,540
Someone's coming. It's the witness!

112
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:18,500
You're the witness, right?

113
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:21,240
 - Is Gong Ji Cheol the killer? 
- One word, please! 

114
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:24,690
Is this the face that you saw?

115
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:31,180
I'll ask again. Did you see the defendant killing Yoon Jeong Hui?

116
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:32,790
Yes.

117
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,920
How did he kill her?

118
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:56,790
He used a thick wooden stick to strike Yoon Jeong Hui's head.

119
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:59,580
 How could he do that? 

120
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:04,390
"Would you become my bride?"

121
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:09,930
Why do you think that the defendant scribbled this here, Witness?

122
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:14,670
The scribble... He always watched me at my bookstore,

123
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:18,660
and I think he imitated the proposal that my boyfriend made to me.

124
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:26,980
Have you ever thought it could be Gong Ji Cheol's warning of murder?

125
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:31,520
The paintings of eleven women he killed.

126
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:37,550
In the paintings, all of the female victims were dressed in white like brides.

127
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:44,790
Your Honors,

128
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:51,040
the defendant was abandoned by his biological mother. He was imprisoned and abused by his stepmother.

129
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:54,090
He grew up being emotionally abused as well.

130
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:57,620
And the defendant's psychological exam results

131
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:01,270
show that he was stabbed with scissors by his stepmother

132
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:05,980
and he was even sexually abused.

133
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:13,010
This is evidence that the defendant was stabbed with scissors by his stepmother.

134
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:19,030
The hairstylist, Yoon Jeong Hui, who worked in the evenings.

135
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:24,660
There were rumors in the neighborhood that she was involved with many men.

136
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:30,810
That day, what kind of advances did Yoon Jeong Hui make on the defendant?

137
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:32,770
What a show.

138
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:38,080
When Yoon Jeong Hui held these scissors and approached the defendant,

139
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:45,110
what could the defendant have thought?

140
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:06,050
The defendant is an epilepsy patient. And under highly stressful situations, he goes into seizures.

141
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:11,150
He does not remember what he has done.

142
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:15,110
This is not murder. It is simply an issue with his brain.

143
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,760
Please just tell us one thing!

144
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,950
 Is Gong Ji Cheol the murderer? 

145
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:30,020
 Please tell us! 

146
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:31,130
 Is he the real killer? 

147
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:32,230
 One word, please! 

148
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:33,820
Jeong Ha Eun.

149
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:36,740
- Who are you?
- Cha Hyeong Bin.

150
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:37,920
Oh, Detective Cha.

151
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:41,620
Gong Ji Cheol is going to be treated at the correctional health care and then moved to a psychiatric hospital.

152
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:47,370
A lot of people have died in these psychiatric hospitals. He'll be gone in a couple of days, so don't worry.

153
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:51,840
That bastard is definitely going to escape. We need witness protection.

154
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:56,020
We'll station a police officer in front of the witness's residence.

155
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:59,670
And you're going to be with her 24 hours a day.

156
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:07,050
 One comment, please. 

157
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:10,440
It's Gong Ji Cheol!

158
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:23,390
Take the picture. Hurry!

159
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:46,700
Sit down!

160
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:26,180
 Do you trust me? 

161
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:27,970
 I do. 

162
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:33,110
 You're not capable of murder. 

163
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,460
Detective Cha!

164
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:32,530
This is Gong Ji Cheol's correctional health care that you asked me for.

165
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:35,610
It's the list of doctors and nurses at the facility.

166
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:40,450
   

167
00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:43,840
In Do, can you take Ha Eun to the train station?

168
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:49,310
A weather advisory for heavy snowfall was just announced in Gangwon Province. Will she be okay?

169
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:52,500
You go first, I'll go later.

170
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:56,390
The walkie-talkie won't work at that range.

171
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:58,670
You have to hurry up and come back.

172
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:05,150
   

173
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:36,680
I've seen a lot of clinical neuropsychological cases like this in America.

174
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:43,690
If you can't remember the murder, it shouldn't be classified as murder.

175
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:48,500
This country is so uncivilized... what would they know?

176
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:52,840
What is my blood type?

177
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:57,830
Its AB, why?

178
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:51,610
Gong Ji Cheol attempted murder on a doctor at the correctional health care and escaped prison. He's wanted.

179
00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:54,980
And please send an ambulance.

180
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:00,290
Ha Eun.

181
00:18:00,290 --> 00:18:03,320
Jeong Ha Eun! Ha Eun!

182
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:34,560
Jeong Ha Eun, say something. Over. Ha Eun!

183
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,580
Jeong Ha Eun!

184
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:45,580
 This is Father Andrea. 

185
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:48,940
 Will it be January 24 or 25? 

186
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:51,990
 I'm old so I forget things easily. 

187
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:57,900
 Get off at Samcheonpo Station and ask for Haebora Church. Everyone will know. 

188
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:01,770
 I've prepared everything for your wedding. 

189
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,590
 Wait just a bit longer. 

190
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:42,330
 I'll give my heart to you. 

191
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:49,890
   

192
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:22,670
It's January 25, 1988.

193
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:28,230
It's 5:15 in the morning.

194
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,860
I love you, Hyeong Bin.

195
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:38,250
Don't ever forget my voice as I say this.

196
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:45,310
Twenty years from now, 30 years from now. I want you to be a police officer.

197
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:49,970
Even then, I will miss you.

198
00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:15,600
 Serial murderer Gong Ji Cheol escaped from the correctional health care around midnight. 

199
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,090
 Gong Ji Cheol hit the doctor with a blunt object. 

200
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:23,080
 It's assumed that he escaped in a doctor's coat. 

201
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:47,450
Hold on!

202
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:50,210
I'm a policeman.

203
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:52,050
Stop there!  What the—

204
00:21:52,050 --> 00:21:53,860
Get him!

205
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:06,720
Are you the one who called? Welcome.

206
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,690
Where is Detective Cha Hyeong Bin?

207
00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:10,490
He's going to be here soon, Father.

208
00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:12,740
Do you want to go inside the cathedral?

209
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:16,400
- It's where the ceremony will take place. 
 - Yes.

210
00:22:54,370 --> 00:22:58,860
 I take this vow before Jeong Ha Eun's parents who are resting with God in heaven. 

211
00:23:00,050 --> 00:23:03,660
 I, Cha Hyeong Bin, will devote my life 

212
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:08,910
 to protect my bride, Jeong Ha Eun, until the end. 

213
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:35,600
Hyeong Bin, they say that lovers are bound by a red string from the moment they're born.

214
00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:41,940
For the red string of fate to be cut, one has to die.

215
00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:51,950
Hyeong Bin, whether you're alive or dead, I'll find you.

216
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:58,340
And you have to find me, too, okay?

217
00:24:21,370 --> 00:24:28,850
I take Cha Hyeong Bin as my husband.

218
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:36,290
When we are together or apart, while we're living in eternity as lovers,

219
00:24:36,290 --> 00:24:43,810
I vow to only love Cha Hyeong Bin.

220
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:53,840
Is this Haebora Church? Father Andrea?

221
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:57,700
Yes, this is Cha Hyeong Bin. Did Ha Eun arrive at the cathedral?

222
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:02,790
 Detective Cha Hyeong Bin is with me, right now... 

223
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:05,650
Father, look at that man's face closely.

224
00:25:05,650 --> 00:25:08,190
 Does he have a scar on his left eye? 

225
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:17,020
My eyes aren't good so I can't see.

226
00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:28,190
Was the person who called... Cha Hyeong Bin?

227
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:36,070
Did you come here to kill someone?

228
00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:43,430
Can souls that commit suicide be reborn?

229
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:50,610
All people are sinners.

230
00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:54,150
And all can receive forgiveness from God.

231
00:25:55,810 --> 00:25:58,320
God.

232
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:03,310
No. I don't want forgiveness from God, I want it from that girl.

233
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:05,800
No.

234
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:10,720
I want to ask that girl

235
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:15,520
whether I can become human.

236
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:21,090
I came to tell that girl

237
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:27,010
that I don't want to be a beast.

238
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:32,910
I want to prove that

239
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:36,360
that girl's trust wasn't wrong.

240
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:39,470
Jeong Ha Eun.

241
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:44,350
She's the first woman

242
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:48,480
who looked at me in the eyes.

243
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:52,100
She's the first person

244
00:26:57,050 --> 00:26:59,720
who called me by my name.

245
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:45,930
♫  I saw you in my dream last night  ♫

246
00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:52,350
♫  I can't forget you whose name I do not know  ♫

247
00:27:53,100 --> 00:28:00,380
♫  I remember how you looked, my love that I had forgotten  ♫

248
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:07,350
♫  My lover whom I had met in my previous years  ♫

249
00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:15,040
♫  The one I had met in the autumn  ♫

250
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:23,330
♫  If I open my eyes, I'm afraid I'll wake up from my dream  ♫

251
00:28:23,330 --> 00:28:31,110
♫  So I can't open my eyes and I get to see you again  ♫

252
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:38,640
♫  My dream is broken like a bubble  ♫

253
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:46,960
♫  My love, I'll see you tonight  ♫

254
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:12,770
I... I... I'm...

255
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:20,210
Gong Ji Cheol!

256
00:29:33,930 --> 00:29:35,810
I told you.

257
00:29:35,810 --> 00:29:39,020
If you even looked at Ha Eun, I'd kill you.

258
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:41,430
If I put you in prison, you'll get out again.

259
00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:44,030
You won't stop until you kill Ha Eun.

260
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:48,390
Your mind has only murder.

261
00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:50,840
Please give me...

262
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:54,390
time. Just once.

263
00:29:56,550 --> 00:29:59,870
Did you give the women time before you killed them?

264
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:03,510
No!

265
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:50,700
Hyeong Bin.

266
00:30:55,510 --> 00:30:58,780
Hyeong Bin! Hyeong Bin.

267
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:15,540
No!

268
00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:29,840
No.

269
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:32,290
No!

270
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,950
Hyeong Bin.

271
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:51,680
You'll never be able to go to Ha Eun.

272
00:32:15,730 --> 00:32:17,260
Hyeong Bin.

273
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:20,780
Ha Eun. God...

274
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:23,440
please save Ha Eun.

275
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:04,560
I told you

276
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:08,050
that the souls would be resurrected, right?

277
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:14,770
Gong Ji Cheol, listen to me carefully.

278
00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:22,340
You'll never be resurrected.

279
00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:57,780
 My plan to give that girl my heart... has failed. 

280
00:33:57,780 --> 00:34:01,130
 Because of that, I hoped this would be my last. 

281
00:34:01,130 --> 00:34:08,070
 The conclusion of my fate and soul. Jeong Ha Eun. Just like she cursed me, 

282
00:34:08,070 --> 00:34:13,640
 I hoped that my soul, tainted by murder, wouldn't be resurrected.  

283
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:15,780
 I wished that once again. 

284
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:41,780
♫  I saw you in my dream last night  ♫

285
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:48,680
♫  I can't forget you whose name I do not know  ♫

286
00:34:49,770 --> 00:34:57,860
♫  I have never seen you before, and I don't know your name  ♫

287
00:34:57,860 --> 00:35:03,010
♫  My love who came in my dream last night  ♫

288
00:35:05,690 --> 00:35:09,580
   

289
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:33,420
I finished reading it.

290
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:35,750
That quickly?

291
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:38,710
I have a habit of only reading the parts I like. 
   

292
00:35:38,710 --> 00:35:43,000
But don't you need the scribbles in this book?

293
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,390
Scribbles are a book's history.

294
00:35:45,390 --> 00:35:50,130
The first person who read this book. And the next person.

295
00:35:50,130 --> 00:35:54,680
And I'm anticipating the next after next person to read this book. For this book's history.

296
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:28,210
 We thank Jeong In Gyeom and Park Mi Hyeon for their special appearances. 

297
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:37,010
 Timing and Subtitles by the Reborn Team @ viki 

298
00:36:43,210 --> 00:36:45,070
   

299
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:47,980
 By chance... are you Cheon Jong Beom? 

300
00:36:49,970 --> 00:36:52,480
 What is this, déjà vu? 

301
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,700
 I was worried about you before, too. 

302
00:36:56,430 --> 00:36:58,750
 I can tell right away that she'll die young. 

303
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:02,020
 A skeleton came out of the East River. 

304
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:06,170
 What happened 30 years ago? 

305
00:37:06,170 --> 00:37:08,700
 I felt pain.
