1
00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:04,020
   

2
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:19,560
Sir, do you believe in reincarnation?

3
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:24,610
A convict who was on his way to confess his love to a woman

4
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:29,170
was reborn as a psychopath who doesn't know what love feels like.

5
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:32,510
It's such an appealing subject for a novel.

6
00:00:32,510 --> 00:00:34,200
Right, Sir?

7
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,490
 Why do you believe that kid is Ji Cheol? 

8
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:46,000
The eyes I saw yesterday didn't belong to the kid.

9
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:51,660
Cheon Jong Beom's eyes are cold as ice,

10
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:57,360
but the ones I saw yesterday were smiling even while angry.

11
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:04,750
That kid... remembered what happened 30 years ago in detail.

12
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:09,370
I'm certain... the two are coexisting.

13
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:13,980
 I know. Because I was there. 

14
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:17,290
 The place where Gong In Woo killed your stepfather. 

15
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:23,190
 Then the fact that Jang Hye Mi was the woman who helped Gong In Woo with the murder will be revealed to the world. 

16
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:30,230
He found out too much. He was a special child to me in many ways...

17
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:38,970
Oh, why isn't this working!

18
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:41,110
That's it. I'm done for today.

19
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:47,090
Please take care of the rest for me!

20
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:55,190


21
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:10,110
   

22
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:14,370
   

23
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:31,590
   

24
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:34,390
 Yuhon Gallery at 11:00. 

25
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:37,070
 Come see Gong In Woo in person. 

26
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:52,870
It's been a long time, Sir.

27
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:57,230
You've stored my precious paintings well.

28
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,930
Isn't it beautiful?

29
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:06,370
A painting that was completed with someone's blood.

30
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:09,870
There's always artistic sacrifice.

31
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:13,190
Artistic sacrifice, my ass.

32
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:15,950
It's just the excuse of a vile murderer.

33
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:26,830
You! Are you Ji Cheol?

34
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:28,760
It's the final meeting of father and son.

35
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:31,080
Don't interrupt.

36
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:37,600
How are you, my father?

37
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:44,540
Hye Mi was right.

38
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:50,100
Your weak eyes and unfailing rage.

39
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:54,320
You're exactly the same!

40
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:57,140
1979, Hwang Sa Yeong.

41
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:59,840
1980, Jo In Yo.

42
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,060
1981, Lee Jeong Seon, Yoon Eun Jeong.

43
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:08,600
Those 10 women... You killed them all, didn't you?

44
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:15,660
Since I was 17, I've been called a genius and put on exhibitions.

45
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:18,950
All my life, I've never stopped creating.

46
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:22,060
Do you think they were the only ones I killed?

47
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:27,200
I'm really curious about something.

48
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:33,200
You could live like a devil by yourself. Why did you involve me?

49
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,880
What?

50
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:42,850
You knew I loved Jeong Hae Eun, but still tried to killed her.

51
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:48,140
That's right. The woman that you loved so much,

52
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:57,000
Jeong Ha Eun, was never going to be yours.

53
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,750
You were reckless with your love.

54
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:04,840
No, isn't love itself reckless?

55
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:15,450
So when you had a chance,

56
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:19,110
you were going to kill Jeong Ha Eun?

57
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:26,700
I watched her eyes until the moment of death.

58
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:34,220
The moment where life turns to death, the moment where the light fades away from the eyes,

59
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:39,250
how beautiful it is...

60
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:41,520
that light...

61
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,990
I only wanted to gift it to Jeong Ha Eun, too.

62
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:58,030
My whole life, I only thought the heavens were cruel to me.

63
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,240
But I realized today,

64
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:06,160
that it gives me a chance, too.

65
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:12,970
 You can win. Fight with the monster inside you. 

66
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:18,000
 Imagine my face on the person you want to kill. 

67
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,810
 The bloody hand that stabs me, think of it as your own. 

68
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:25,950
 Imagine what it would feel like to stab me. If you can still kill... 

69
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,540
It's time to end the conversation of the father and son.

70
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:47,290
We have a guest, Ji Cheol.

71
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,130
Jong Beom.

72
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:56,820
   

73
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:05,090
 No! 

74
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,800
 No! 

75
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:31,180
 Since I was 17, I've been called a genius and put on exhibitions. 

76
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:34,240
 All my life, I've never stopped creating. 

77
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,510
 Do you think they were the only ones I killed? 

78
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:39,920
   

79
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:44,300
They found a luminol reaction on the seal of Gong Ji Cheol's painting from the storage.

80
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:46,850
You know, the painting with the sharp eyes?

81
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:51,160
The seal on the bottom left is blood.

82
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,510
The seal is the blood?

83
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:59,080
It's Gong In Woo's blood. He paints seals with his own blood.

84
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:04,030
This is a recording of his confession. Check it carefully,

85
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:09,140
and make sure that this time you catch the murderer you missed 30 years ago,

86
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:11,430
Detective Cha Hyeong Bin.

87
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:18,690
I thought I was the only one who knew you as Detective Cha.

88
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:27,560
Hold on.

89
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:32,880
Really... who are you?

90
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:00,630
 What happened 30 years ago? 

91
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:16,610
 I recognize you, so why can't you recognize me? 

92
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,930
Gong Ji Cheol...

93
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:36,890
 I watched her eyes until the moment of death. 

94
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:40,040
 The moment where life turns to death, 

95
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:47,540
 the moment where the light fades away from the eyes... how beautiful it is... 

96
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:53,670
 that light, I only wanted to gift it to Jeong Ha Eun, too. 

97
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:08,110
 I'm different from you. You've never loved a woman. 

98
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:17,800
 She's going to die anyway even if you don't kill her. If you want, I can let her die comfortably. 

99
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:21,980
 You knew I loved Jeong Ha Eun but still tried to kill her. 

100
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:25,190
 You were reckless with your love. 

101
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:29,280
 No, isn't love itself reckless? 

102
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:58,230
 Let's have a drink to celebrate being family. 

103
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:04,250
 You were... worried about me? 

104
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:09,110
 Why did he die out in the ocean when he was a convict? 

105
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:14,040
 He had to... see the woman he loved. 

106
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,810
Big news! Huge!

107
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:17,470
What is it now? What happened?

108
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:21,160
I finally did it after several sleepless nights!

109
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:24,620
Come here. It's amazing.

110
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:32,860
I restored the convict's remains. Look.

111
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:39,930
Look at him. He looks just like your stalker.

112
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:43,520
Don't joke around. I'm not in the mood.

113
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:09,170
What's wrong?

114
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:20,490
Are you in shock because he looks just like your student?

115
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:22,920
What do you mean they look alike?

116
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:27,050
You just put Cheon Jong Beom's face on it because you were tired of working on it, didn't you?

117
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:32,210
No! I didn't do this. The computer generated it!

118
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:37,350
They really... do look alike, though.

119
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:43,830
Their face... and their unlucky lives...

120
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:05,990
 I dreamed that you'd been shot again. You're okay, right? 

121
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:10,740
   

122
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:12,640
   

123
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:15,120
   

124
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:23,520
♫   Meeting you   ♫

125
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:30,720
 Yeah, Jong Beom. Jong Beom, is something wrong? 

126
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:36,180
Can you come here right now?

127
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:39,550
 Where are you? 

128
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:43,430
Right now, I'm on my way to my rooftop room.

129
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:48,140
But my head hurts too much. I don't know what to do.

130
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:53,400
Your head? Which side hurts? Tell me in detail.

131
00:14:54,090 --> 00:15:00,050
♫   Pain rushes into the heart   ♫

132
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:07,560
♫   Even if I'm left alone again   ♫

133
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:15,060
♫   So I can be with you forever   ♫

134
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:37,530
♫   My exhausted soul that can't be reached   ♫

135
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:44,620
♫   So that it won't be tired anymore   ♫

136
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:55,460
Wow, what's with you?

137
00:15:55,460 --> 00:16:01,670
You sounded like you were about to die, but you sit here without a care in the world.

138
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:09,030
My head really hurt, but now that I see you, I'm fine.

139
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:11,430
Are you sure you're okay?

140
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:13,850
I have a question.

141
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:21,080
Can you... show me the text from the day I was shot?

142
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:35,030
 If Cheon Jong Beom commits his first murder, who would he kill? 

143
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:14,780
As soon as I woke up after being shot, there was something I wanted to say.

144
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:24,230
I thought everything was over once you died.

145
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:32,290
Living again after dying, living again after being shot...

146
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:38,040
I didn't know what kept bringing me back to life.

147
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,860
Now I know.

148
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:49,090
It's because I wanted to say that.

149
00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:51,950
Say... what?

150
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:09,050
 I... I'm... 

151
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:13,640
I'm...

152
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,810
I'm not an animal.

153
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:45,770
I'm relieved that I was reborn this way.

154
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:52,620
I don't have to lose anymore, and I don't have to steal glances anymore.

155
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:57,250
I can like as I wish.

156
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:15,720
You kid... Treating your senior this way!

157
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:20,060
The back of your head seems the prettiest to me.

158
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:21,050
What?

159
00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:26,400
Your eyes, cheekbones, and the lower lips move together.

160
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,710
You seem to be in a good mood.

161
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:36,970
Seeing you joking around puts my mind at ease.

162
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:39,000
Stand up for a second.

163
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:48,390
How about you get some sleep? You don't look good right now.

164
00:19:57,690 --> 00:20:01,200
Your headache should go away.

165
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:23,310
A side effect of brain surgery is the loss of the sense of space.

166
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:29,470
Take it and get some sleep.

167
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:34,620
Never mind the medicine. Can't you stay with me?

168
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:47,120
Well, since you're a patient, I should be the caregiver.

169
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:07,570
Jong Beom, you've never once been an animal.

170
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:16,440
Even though you lived among animal-like people, you were always a human being.

171
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:24,180
Until the bad memories in your head disappear,

172
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:29,390
I'll never let go of this hand.

173
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:50,480
 The only love that exists 

174
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:56,700
  in this world for me... My savior. 

175
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:40,480
I thought you'd recognize Gong Ji Cheol.

176
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:48,310
In your book, it says he lived on after the execution.

177
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:53,310
Then, can you tell me how he ended up dying in the end?

178
00:22:56,150 --> 00:22:59,150
The prosecutor in charge of the execution...

179
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:06,400
He found out that the convict he executed was walking around alive. Why would he let him be?

180
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:12,190
From what I heard, he got caught by organ traffickers and killed out on the ocean.

181
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:19,470
But... Gong Ji Cheol's memories inside Cheon Jong Beom.

182
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:25,230
Have his former life's memories returned?

183
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:32,200
Maybe you told him? You said you took special care of him.

184
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:36,870
Why would I dig my own grave?

185
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:45,600
Reading your book, it seems like I have another child

186
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:50,820
other than Ji Cheol.

187
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:03,310
She's a violinist.

188
00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:09,920
She inherited your artistic abilities.

189
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:42,420
Huh?

190
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:46,470
Wh-What are you doing here?

191
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:51,460
Oh... no.

192
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:53,910
N-No way.

193
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:59,350
You've been... ki-killing all those people?

194
00:25:11,230 --> 00:25:16,720
I'm writer Jang Hye Mi's daughter Baek Sang Ah, Dad.

195
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:20,950
Sang Ah? My daughter?

196
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:26,870
Well, it's nice to meet you.

197
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:31,360
Sit down.

198
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:37,280
I hear you're artistically very talented just like me.

199
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:45,220
I wondered where I should start our conversation.

200
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:48,930
But now that I see you, there's nothing to worry about.

201
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:54,150
Since the moment I saw Gong Ji Cheol's name in Mom's book,

202
00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:59,630
I've never stopped thinking of Gong Ji Cheol my whole life.

203
00:26:00,450 --> 00:26:04,080
If not through murder, the thirst is never quenched...

204
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:07,570
Crazy Gong Ji Cheol.

205
00:26:07,570 --> 00:26:10,120
I needed a friend who could understand me.

206
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:14,840
And then I started to believe that Gong Ji Cheol might be alive.

207
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:18,330
That's what it said in Mom's book.

208
00:26:18,330 --> 00:26:21,420
That one day he'll come back to us.

209
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:28,450
In order to draw Gong Ji Cheol out,

210
00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:34,040
I sent messages in his name and made a blog in honor of him.

211
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:36,950
And committed copycat murders.

212
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:42,160
Then I ended up feeling like I became Gong Ji Cheol.

213
00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:49,600
Today, I finally meet Gong Ji Cheol from Mom's book.

214
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:59,680
Though it wasn't Gong Ji Cheol but you, Gong In Woo.

215
00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:05,260
It also turns out that he's my dad...

216
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:12,440
You're more like me than I thought.

217
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:20,950
Dad... I have a question.

218
00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:28,890
A man I love, the woman who stole him from me,

219
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:32,020
and the man who protects her...

220
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:37,250
I want to kill all three, but who should I kill first?

221
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:41,620
Which of them hurts you the most?

222
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:47,040
Shouldn't you ask who puts me in danger the most?

223
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,790
Don't hesitate.

224
00:27:50,490 --> 00:27:54,880
All you have to do is just concentrate on your scar.

225
00:27:57,470 --> 00:28:00,970
From now on, I'll visit you often, Dad.

226
00:28:01,710 --> 00:28:04,500
You'll help me a lot, won't you?

227
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:11,680
As long as you don't kill me, why wouldn't I help you?

228
00:28:26,290 --> 00:28:28,260
Yellow umbrella...

229
00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:30,890
   

230
00:28:30,890 --> 00:28:33,290
Gong In Woo...

231
00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:47,980
Other singularities?

232
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:51,190
According to the crime lab, a muscle paralytic was used.

233
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:55,290
But once we identified the victim, it wasn't Gong In Woo but Gang Doo Cheol.

234
00:28:55,290 --> 00:28:59,610
Another name was used during Kim Hee Soo's murder. What's the reason?

235
00:28:59,610 --> 00:29:02,060
Detective Cha... I mean, Prosecutor Kim?

236
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:06,160
These people are joking around with names like they have nothing better to do.

237
00:29:07,450 --> 00:29:09,680
 Yuhon Gallery, 11:00. 

238
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:12,120
 Come check Gong In Woo in person. 

239
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:15,530
 I've never stopped creating all my life. 

240
00:29:15,530 --> 00:29:18,820
 Do you think they were the only ones I killed? 

241
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:52,500
 If this was a ring, I would engrave today's date on it. 

242
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,560
 Too bad... 

243
00:30:12,650 --> 00:30:15,120
   

244
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:25,470
Who on earth are you waiting for?

245
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:34,070
That woman! Let's go!

246
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:37,500
Hold on. I need to check something.

247
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,980
Let's meet right now.

248
00:30:57,590 --> 00:31:03,040
You knew all along that Baek Sang Ah was the one who stabbed Joo In Do.

249
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,620
Why didn't you report it?

250
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:09,480
Like you said, even if you lock them up, they'll crawl back out.

251
00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:14,180
Jeong Sa Bin was the one Baek Sang Ah was after.

252
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:18,690
So I was going to kill her. Not Jeong Sa Bin but...

253
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:27,620
Since you play around with the law so well, punish Baek Sang Ah properly.

254
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:32,030
Like you said, she's rotten in here.

255
00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:34,080
So she'll kill again if she gets out.

256
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:36,540
Who do you think the first victim would be?

257
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:41,460
Just as much as you like Jeong Sa Bin, she'll want to kill her.

258
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:42,960
What?

259
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,770
How do you...

260
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:49,650
I heard it from her directly. Since I saw it in person.

261
00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:51,170
You saw it in person?

262
00:31:51,170 --> 00:31:54,280
If you put her on trial, I'll give it to you then.

263
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:56,620
Crucial evidence.
