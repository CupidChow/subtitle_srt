 Yours and mine are the same."

00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:51,760
 I'm going to be your lover forever.

00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:55,120
 You can marry another girl. 

8
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:59,850
 I don't want to be embraced by your body but by your soul. 

9
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:03,160
 Not for me. 

10
00:01:05,490 --> 00:01:08,800
 Just looking at you like this makes me happy.

 Pick a book as well.

 I'll buy you one today.

 Don't die.

 I'll bring you a heart.

39
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:04,480
Would you happen to know where Kim Soo Hyeok went?

40
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:07,770
He was asking earlier which room Patient Joo In Do was in.

41
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:10,510
Detective Joo is famous since he's been our long-term patient.

42
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:13,920
Yes, Detective Joo In Do. Where is his room?

43
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:25,110
Excuse me... Detective Joo In Do?

44
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:38,720
No... No way. Did you reincarnate, too?

45
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:58,060
You said you remembered the bookstore owner from 30 years ago, didn't you?

46
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:07,970
Yeah. This is her.

47
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:12,490
My friend's daughter. Her name was Ha Eun.

48
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:20,550
You said that you went to Ha Eun's funeral.

49
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:23,410
Do you know where she's buried?

50
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:27,120
It was something like an... arboretum.

51
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,010
My wife will know.

52
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:31,490
If you remember, please contact me.

53
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:06,490
Do you know who that person that just left is?

54
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:09,910
Just now? Do you know him?

55
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:17,900
     

56
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:24,240
Take care.

57
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:33,560
Was it Kim Soo Hyeok who shot Cheon Jong Beom?

58
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:37,510
 Where are you right now? I'll tell you in person. 

59
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:42,630
I'll wait in front of the used bookstore in Cheonggyecheon.

60
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:59,060
   

61
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:08,550
 Ah, you really worry me so much. How can you leave without a word? 

62
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,250
The voices are alike.

63
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:15,020
 Excuse me? 

64
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,990
Never mind.

65
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:21,830
You ran away without your jacket and wallet so you're probably empty-handed.

66
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:24,430
Wait there. I'm on my way to the bookstore to get you.

67
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:25,970
How did you know I was at the bookstore?

68
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:27,750
 I heard from Detective Joo In Do. 

69
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:32,370
 He said you went to Old Future Bookstore. Is there a suspect there or something? 

70
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:53,990
It has never hurt this much since I got my transplant.

71
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:56,010
What's going on?

72
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,530
Are you all right?

73
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:06,800
That's what I wanted to ask you. Are you all right?

74
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:36,460
That's right. Take a good look at Kim Soo Hyeok.

75
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:41,220
He's my enemy and your enemy. The reason I rescued you is because of that jerk.

76
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:47,690
With the bullet in your head, I'm going to prove that he's a murdering prosecutor.

77
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,200
Jeong Ha Eun.

78
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,220
Jeong Ha Eun?

79
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:07,430
 Are the hearts connected between two people in love? 

80
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:14,460
 The moment I feel pain in my heart, the other feels it, too. 

81
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:21,180
 It's not that you feel hurt, but like a dagger going through the heart, right here... 

82
00:10:55,630 --> 00:11:01,460
Ji Cheol... Gong Ji Cheol.

83
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,770
   
  I'll ask again. What's your name?  

84
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:09,650
 Gong Ji Cheol. 

85
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,300
  When were you born?  

86
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:19,380
 1961... June 14th, 1961. 

87
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:21,950
 What year do you think it is now? 

88
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:29,260
 1987. And I... died the next year. 

89
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:33,960
 Because of the bullet, I think he's having trouble with his sense of time. 

90
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:38,300
 He's lost all his recent memories and seems to have retained only his past memories. 

91
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:42,720
 But... his name isn't Gong Ji Cheol, it's Cheon Jong Beom. 

92
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:48,120
 Also, why would someone who was born in 1998 talk about 1987? 

93
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:51,850
 Is there anyone you remember? 

94
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:55,480
 Someone I remember... 

95
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:02,650
 I think we should do some more tests today. 

96
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,760
 What are you doing? 

97
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,730
 I'm checking his brain signal. 

98
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:35,880
 He has very strong memories related to snowy fields. 

99
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,780
 Snowy fields. 

100
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:52,030
 The reason I was reborn... Jeong Ha Eun. 

101
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:58,850
     

102
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:07,460
     

103
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:31,330
 You need to come back if you feel nauseous or a deteriorating sense of space. 

104
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:36,050
 If the bullet in your brain moves, you could die at any moment. 

105
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,140
     

106
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:02,970
The tenth yellow umbrella victim.

107
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:07,770
1987, the 10th yellow umbrella victim, Jo Yoon Hee.

108
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:13,770
 One guy kills and the other gives a funeral. No? 

109
00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:17,800
  - One guy kills...   
- ...and one guy painted.

110
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:25,530
Ha Eun was the last person Gong Ji Cheol was after.

111
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:29,690
And if it's the same now...

112
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:32,690
 It's a heart transplant patient. 

113
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:36,130
 It's too detailed to call it a copycat crime. 

114
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:38,940
     

115
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,580
     

116
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:47,390
The third recent victim of the yellow umbrella serial murder case, Kim Hee Soo.

117
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:53,520
The guy who killed Kim Hee Soo and the one who painted her...

118
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:07,330
The guy who killed Kim Hee Soo, his target right now is Jeong Sa Bin.

119
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:15,130
What connects 1987 and the present is... a painting.

120
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:19,360
If I track the painting, I can see the culprit.

121
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:24,890
Let's hurry up.

122
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:30,000
Oh my, this is so heavy!

123
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,490
I told you to take care of them earlier, didn't I?

124
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:35,830
Huh? W-What's that?

125
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:40,650
- Take a look. 
 - Aren't these a dead person's bones?

126
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:42,450
What?

127
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:45,540
Find out where Gang Doo Cheol stores his paintings. I'll issue a search warrant.

128
00:17:56,470 --> 00:18:00,310
     

129
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,750
   

130
00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:27,030
 The person you called cannot answer the phone, so... 

131
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:34,000
   

132
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,240
   

133
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:39,690
 This morning, at a fishing depot in Gangwon Province, 

134
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:45,730
 remains suspected to be those of an adult were found caught in a net. 

135
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:49,040
 While working on the nets in order to head out to sea, 

136
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:53,350
 fishermen found the remains and contacted the police. 

137
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:56,970
 The police checked the nearby nets and investigated the area around the depot 

138
00:18:56,980 --> 00:19:00,860
 and collected about 130 pieces of the remains as well as belongings. 

139
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:06,060
 But it will take a few days to find out the exact cause of death and identify the victim. 

140
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:10,150
 The police plan to request an autopsy by the NFS 

141
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:13,670
 and also stated that they will look into possible connections to any criminal cases. 

142
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:15,310
I'm going to school.

143
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:19,300
Oh, wait. I have something to give you.

144
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:38,050
But I can't drive.

145
00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:42,900
What are you talking about? You got a license as soon as you graduated from high school.

146
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:50,620
This card has no limit. Use it to maintain your class.

147
00:19:54,350 --> 00:20:00,200
I'm really happy that you're back, Jong Beom.

148
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:05,880
What? You don't like the car?

149
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:08,800
No. How could I not?

150
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:41,810
 If you can't remember, just follow your instincts. 

151
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:41,560
Cheong Jong Beom!

152
00:21:56,850 --> 00:22:00,480
You really... you came back to Korea and ignored all my messages?

153
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,630
Why are you making me suffer so much?

154
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:06,810
♫   The whole world   ♫

155
00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:12,840
What a relief. Such a relief.

156
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:21,240
♫   Even if someday a difficult time comes for us   ♫

157
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:25,890
This jerk... Are you feeling okay?

158
00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:32,350
Why aren't you saying anything? Are you all right?

159
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:35,840
♫   You're my one and only love   ♫

160
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:40,180
♫   Don't let go of my hand   ♫

161
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:42,800
♫   My dear   ♫

162
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,160
 Jeong Ha Eun... 

163
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:49,150
Are you worried about me?

164
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:51,070
♫   You're the one I want to see   ♫

165
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:55,010
Hey... Your first lecture is my class, right? Let's go.

166
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:04,350
 The 137 children's remains discovered in Peru 

167
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:07,320
 all had their hearts cut out. 

168
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:11,250
About 540 years ago, around 1450,

169
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:15,930
they were offered as religious sacrifices by the Chimu tribe in northern Peru.

170
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:18,760
In the ancient burial customs,

171
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:21,620
it was popular to remove the hearts.

172
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:23,490
In ancient times, they believed in resurrection

173
00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:27,880
and thought removing the heart would prevent resurrection.

174
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:58,120
     

175
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:03,540
Many now believe resurrection to be an absurd story,

176
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:08,300
but resurrection murders still happen from time-to-time.

177
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:11,030
Shall we stop here for today?

178
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:15,300
You know the reports are due next week, right?

179
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:19,340
I expect your fresh take on virtual autopsy.

180
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:33,570
Write a report about what you've been up to lately.

181
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,300
Yes, Team Leader?

182
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:50,020
 The remains found today in the East Sea came in for an autopsy. 

183
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:51,070
 You heard, right? 

184
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:54,620
Yes, of course. I'll leave now.

185
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:56,590
Wait a second.

186
00:24:58,450 --> 00:25:00,460
Are you free today?

187
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:05,360
You still have one more participation practice left. Let's call this your last one.

188
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,400
Today's autopsy is of a convict.

189
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:10,790
Convict? But what's a participation practice?

190
00:25:10,790 --> 00:25:14,500
If you're joking, stop. It's not funny.

191
00:25:23,210 --> 00:25:26,090
Do you want to eat together after the autopsy?

192
00:25:26,090 --> 00:25:29,350
Yes, that sounds good. Then I'll buy our meal.

193
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:30,760
What do you want to eat?

194
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:33,620
That's the kind of thing seniors buy.

195
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,040
You... bought a car? What about your bike?

196
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:48,430
I don't ride bikes...

197
00:25:48,430 --> 00:25:50,010
Get in.

198
00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:07,980
Jong Beom, is your head all right?

199
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:10,350
Did they say there were no problems?

200
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:12,400
I'm fine.

201
00:26:17,050 --> 00:26:21,240
Jong Beom, I was really worried about you.

202
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:24,790
I couldn't sleep and couldn't eat well.

203
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:25,550
Why?

204
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:32,500
I'll apologize for that day on Prosecutor Kim Soo Hyeok's behalf.

205
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:35,430
Prosecutor Kim Soo Hyeok...

206
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:38,970
You're not him, so why are you apologizing?

207
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:43,240
I just... want to.

208
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:46,960
I feel like everything happened because of me.

209
00:26:54,810 --> 00:26:57,260
The frame is that of an adult male,

210
00:26:57,260 --> 00:27:00,760
but the bone density is lower than average.

211
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:04,260
Signs of malnutrition confirmed from his teeth.

212
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:09,520
Found signs of nonunion on the right tibia as well as the left and right ulna.

213
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:15,200
We just reconstructed the prisoner number found with the remains.

214
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:20,230
We requested the prosecution for the prisoner number classification, so we should find out his identity soon.

215
00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:21,860
Okay.

216
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:43,430
Rib, clavicle.

217
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:47,000
Nonunion also found in the mandible.

218
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:52,790
All appear to be fractured during his growth phase but never treated.

219
00:27:53,530 --> 00:27:57,090
It looks like he was abused.

220
00:27:59,050 --> 00:28:03,810
An oblique linear scar on the ophthalmic bone. Was it from a knife?

221
00:28:03,810 --> 00:28:07,460
It wasn't a knife. It was probably scissors.

222
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:08,800
How do you know?

223
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:11,320
I can just tell.

224
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:14,010
They probably didn't mean to kill him.

225
00:28:14,010 --> 00:28:19,190
If they did, he would have been stabbed in a vital point.

226
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:21,080
They wanted to inflict pain.

227
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:23,050
 I told you to stop crying! 

228
00:28:23,050 --> 00:28:24,970
  Die!  

229
00:28:55,800 --> 00:29:01,700
But why did a convict die out in the sea?

230
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:06,430
He had to meet the person he loved.

231
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:15,630
If he could meet that woman again, he would have risked his life multiple times.

232
00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:27,310
That convict would have fought to live while dying.

233
00:29:28,930 --> 00:29:34,480
Because he hadn't told that woman he loved her.

234
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:38,010
You talk as if it's your own story.

235
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:41,260
By chance... are you empathizing with the remains?

236
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:45,860
 I'll show you that I'm not an animal. 

237
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:48,630
 I'll show you who the real murderer is, too. 

238
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:55,770
   

239
00:29:55,770 --> 00:29:58,970
I'll finish the autopsy. Do you want to leave first?

240
00:29:58,970 --> 00:30:01,030
I'll do that, Professor.

241
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:02,990
But why aren't you calling me "Senior" anymore?

242
00:30:02,990 --> 00:30:04,820
"Senior'?

243
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:07,990
Senior.

244
00:30:24,670 --> 00:30:28,500
 The person you called cannot answer the call. 

245
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:32,530
   

246
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:35,870
