1
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:07,080
   

2
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:31,250
   

3
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:37,470
What brings you here?

4
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:38,890
If you're going home, get in.

5
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:41,270
I can take the bus.

6
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:44,610
- The shuttle buses aren't running now. 
 - I can take a cab.

7
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:48,160
There have been two robberies involving cabs around here just this month.

8
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,380
And last week, someone was abducted in a cab and raped.

9
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:53,340
Please just get in.

10
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:22,490
Why were you at the hospital today?

11
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,770
Prison Guard Jeong Seong Eun was your father?

12
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:28,670
So... you came to see my dad?

13
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:30,490
Why?

14
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:35,980
Must be hungry. You're swallowing your words.

15
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:37,740
Move him to another nursing hospital.

16
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:41,510
Even if you request that no one but family should be allowed to visit, that hospital lets anyone have access.

17
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:47,280
- Pardon? 
 - Miss Jeong Sa Bin, do you know any martial arts like judo, taekwondo or hapkido?

18
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,940
Well, no.

19
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:52,870
I warned you not to involve yourself in others' affairs, didn't I?

20
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:56,800
Where do you get the guts to try and fight a knife-wielding gangster with only a parking stub?

21
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:01,090
Also, don't you know it's suicide to jump in the water to save someone who's drowning?

22
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:04,550
You did the same thing.

23
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:09,500
Also, save those worries for your woman, Mr. Kim Soo Hyeok.

24
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:12,490
Don't ever save me again. Whether or not I fall in the water.

25
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:15,530
There are plenty of people who can save me beside you.

26
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:18,650
I'm just a passerby to you.

27
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:23,390
You know, don’t you? Passerby 1, Passerby 2 like in the movies?

28
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:25,710
You have nothing more to say, right?

29
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:35,430
♫   My lover, I'd seen some year ago   ♫

30
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:42,750
♫   Dearest, whom I've met some autumns ago   ♫

31
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:51,330
♫   I'm afraid if I open my eyes I will awake from this dream   ♫

32
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:58,820
♫   So I am unable to open my eyes as I watch you   ♫

33
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:06,410
♫   My dream that is broken like a bubble   ♫

34
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:14,170
♫   Please come tonight, my dearest   ♫

35
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:21,700
♫   My dearest who disappears when I open my eyes   ♫

36
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:29,300
♫   I am unable to open my eyes as I watch you again   ♫

37
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:36,960
♫   My dream is broken like a bubble   ♫

38
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:45,850
♫   Come to my dream tonight, my dearest   ♫

39
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:58,820
     

40
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:12,020
What are you doing here?

41
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:23,490
Oh, you live here? I had an errand to run for my regular who lives here.

42
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:26,530
We have so many coincidences.

43
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:31,000
You live above my uncle, and you run errands where I live.

44
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,560
When I go to the bookstore, I meet you there.

45
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:36,140
Isn’t that what you call a stalker?

46
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:40,510
A stalker is better than a two-timer though.

47
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:43,160
At least I only look at one woman.

48
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:51,740
Well, get home safe, Prosecutor Kim.

49
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:53,630
I’m hungry. Should we get something to eat?

50
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:56,680
I got paid for my part-time job, so it’s my treat.

51
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:59,100
I think everything’s closed.

52
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,840
The convenience store is still open. Let’s go.

53
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:21,370
I was worried because you left earlier like that.

54
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:27,550
Pomegranates are good for the heart.

55
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:28,550
Have some.

56
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:33,260
Is what I need right now something that’s good for me?

57
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:01,390
 Sense of loss. 

58
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:18,630
I’ve done errands where I listened to secrets. I’ll delete them all after you tell me.

59
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:22,710
Think of me as a wall and tell me.

60
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:24,470
Wall?

61
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:29,370
Fine. Can you not show any reaction from now on?

62
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:35,680
I’m hoping this is because of this man.

63
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:40,390
The heart also has nerves and memory cells.

64
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:46,800
But this death row convict is a 42-year-old.

65
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:51,190
There’s no way he would have had these feelings.

66
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:55,070
My heart flutters, but right here...

67
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:58,620
it flutters like its shattering.

68
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:04,380
How can I actually describe this? What does this heart remember?

69
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:11,030
This isn't fake like VR.

70
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:13,750
It hurts so much here.

71
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:16,920
Sometimes I can't even breathe.

72
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:23,250
That man... how can he be so vivid?

73
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:29,300
His hand grabbing my hand in the water. I can still feel it now.

74
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:36,740
It's tormenting me.

75
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:45,350
So tormenting that I wish my heart would just stop.

76
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:03,990
You can't be the one whose heart stops.

77
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:25,100
That man.  Don't see him again.

78
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:28,350
You can just not see him anymore.

79
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:33,800
I'll help you achieve that.

80
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:39,260
People change.  Why do you love something that will change?

81
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:41,480
And you? You won't change?

82
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,730
- I won't change. 
 - You won't change?

83
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:45,070
I'm not going to change.

84
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:49,390
But you're human, too.  Aren't you human?

85
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:52,060
Because I only love who I choose.

86
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:55,290
♫  And I can't   ♫

87
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:02,740
♫  At times you look sad  ♫

88
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:06,010
♫  that image  ♫

89
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:09,880
Since I'm not human.

90
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:12,660
Because I've never seen love.

91
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:17,220
 You just need to win.  Fight with the monster in you. 

92
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:20,130
 I'll help you win. 

93
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:24,530
♫  Though I know you can't come to me  ♫

94
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:26,540
I just need him to disappear.

95
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:29,260
♫  Words that cannot be said  ♫

96
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:34,550
♫  I keep hearing them alone  ♫

97
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:40,430
♫  Even if love wears me out  ♫

98
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:49,140
♫  I am fine. Even if it's painful, I cannot part from you   ♫

99
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:51,730
 Can't be. 

100
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:54,810
   

101
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:25,780
Your performance is always amazing, Boss.

102
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:32,160
You came on your own.

103
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:36,710
I got the message about your release, but I guess that wasn't enough for you?

104
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:42,950
   

105
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:47,510
She has nothing to do with me, so as of today forget about that woman.

106
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:50,470
- Woman? 
 - This bastard.

107
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:52,320
My boss doesn't mess with women!

108
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,870
Really? Is that why you struck my car with that truck?

109
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:57,710
Well, I'm sorry about that.

110
00:10:57,710 --> 00:11:00,770
Who is she? Someone you're going to marry?

111
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:02,750
You don't need to know about my personal life.

112
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:04,480
That makes me more curious.

113
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,960
She has nothing to do with you, but you came all the way here?

114
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:15,960
You're thinking about messing with women again, aren't you? I only deal with beasts.

115
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:20,950
Your brother the pedophile, Seo Seong Ha.

116
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:25,700
You want your brother to be normal while living like this?

117
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:41,320
Revenge is not made for beasts like you, but for humans.

118
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:44,260
And that's what qualifies you for revenge.

119
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:51,690
That rude bastard.

120
00:11:56,210 --> 00:11:58,880
   

121
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,330
There's someone I need you to watch at the NFS, so stay with her.

122
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:03,660
 The NFS? 

123
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:24,310
Soo Hyeok, you know we exchange gifts today. Right?

124
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:39,270
There are 13 days left until our wedding day.

125
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:43,070
Do you know you haven't even formally proposed yet?

126
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:45,920
I would have done it if you wanted it.

127
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,250
Do it now then.

128
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:49,140
Now?

129
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:30,890
 I'm happy just looking at you like this. 

130
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:34,600
I'm happy just looking at you like this.

131
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:39,210
When you die, I'll be happy that I'm your husband.

132
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:41,010
And if you die,

133
00:13:41,010 --> 00:13:43,090
I can live on longing for this moment.

134
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:50,080
♫   My dream that is broken like a bubble   ♫

135
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:57,780
♫   Please come tonight, my dearest   ♫

136
00:13:57,780 --> 00:14:04,750
♫   My dearest who disappears when I open my eyes   ♫

137
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:06,770
Soo Hyeok.

138
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:11,610
Sorry.

139
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:18,980
I'm at the NFS watching Jeong Sa Bin like you said,

140
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:22,100
but what's Seo Tae Ha doing here?

141
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:27,050
San Ah, sorry. I need to go.

142
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:28,310
What? Why?

143
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:30,500
I'll call you later.

144
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:59,370
Kim Soo Hyeok? This is going to get interesting.

145
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:29,730
You should at least say hello, Prosecutor Kim.

146
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:36,940
You said yourself we're strangers.

147
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:48,740
Hey, Jeong Sa Bin, did you meet Prosecutor Kim?

148
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:51,200
He was looking for you earlier.

149
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,690
Me? When?

150
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:55,520
About 10 minutes ago?

151
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:59,550
I thought you two were up for World War II.

152
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:04,110
He was huffing and puffing. It was no joke.

153
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:28,110
 Hello, this is 911. How can I help you? 

154
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:30,460
I have a question.

155
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:33,080
If you get in an ambulance at the intersection near NFS, where do they take you?

156
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:37,270
 For internal medicine, it's Jisung Hospital, and for surgeries, the ER at Injoo University Hospital. 

157
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:40,130
 Is there an emergency patient? 

158
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,040
Thank you.

159
00:16:57,870 --> 00:17:02,500
What are you doing, you punk? Why are you here?

160
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:05,100
It's a relief. You look well.

161
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:06,470
It's a relief?

162
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:10,130
Are you nuts, you bastard? How dare you sit?!

163
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:14,420
I have a question.

164
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:18,240
Why are you killing for someone else?

165
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:21,330
- What? 
 - I came because I was curious about that.

166
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:33,890
 Blind hatred... 

167
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:37,040
Get lost before I stab you.

168
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:43,540
I guess my expectations were in vain.

169
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:47,500
Hey.

170
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:51,810
Do you know what it means to be a family?

171
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:59,070
I've held a knife since I was 15 in Ansan.

172
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:03,570
Do you know what that means? I'm the first defense in fights.

173
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:07,870
If you're lucky enough to survive getting knifed, you go back out to get knifed again.

174
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:10,250
So you live to die.

175
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:14,290
But Boss Tae Ha took me in as his family.

176
00:18:14,290 --> 00:18:19,520
Do you know what he taught me? You live to live.

177
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:26,060
If that's what you call family, I get it. Killing for your family.

178
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:31,060
But why can't you kill today?

179
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:33,230
- You said you're family. 
 - What?

180
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:36,310
How many unidentified remains do you think there are in this country?

181
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:40,600
If you discover a whole group of them, 100? 1,000?

182
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,560
Maybe more?

183
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:51,500
How many of them do you think your boss has killed?

184
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:55,000
Like what Kim Soo Hyeok did to Byeong Seong Hoon,

185
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,200
if your boss makes you into a serial murderer.

186
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,500
Who are you exactly?

187
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:04,500
I have a debt to pay to Kim Soo Hyeok. Like you.

188
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,360
Sorry, I'm late.

189
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:50,290
Sit down.

190
00:19:55,220 --> 00:20:00,120
I like everything about you except once something catches your eye, you take it too far.

191
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:05,340
Whether it's about Byeon Seong Hoon or Im Hwa Yeong, don't take it any further than I want you to.

192
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,780
It's Cheon Jong Beom.

193
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:20,350
This photo was taken on April 7th at 2:30 p.m..

194
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:26,010
The party started at 6:00 that day, so why was he there at that hour?

195
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:28,950
The female student riding on the back of the bike...

196
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:33,690
On that day, she fell in the water the same way at the exact location where Jong Woo fell.

197
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:36,110
Cheon Jong Beom rescued her from the bridge,

198
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:38,850
and he took her to the hospital.

199
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:40,010
So?

200
00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:43,150
The off-limits sign that was up until right before the party

201
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:48,270
happened to disappear when Jong Woo fell in. Do you think it's a coincidence?

202
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:57,120
What is it you want to say?

203
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:01,940
Cheon Jong Beom will try to kill Jong Woo again.

204
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:06,560
He won't give up until Jong Woo dies.

205
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:20,340
You... What is it that you want to prove?

206
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:32,660
Cheon Jong Beom's true nature... You know it, too, don't you?

207
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:39,330
Whether it's Im Hwa Yeong or Byeon Seung Hoon, Cheon Jong Beom appeared at the end of both cases.

208
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:47,090
If I know, does it change anything?

209
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:52,170
Why can't you let go of Jong Beom?

210
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:54,480
Because he's my son?

211
00:21:58,690 --> 00:22:04,390
You... only need to think about one thing.

212
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:08,110
What you stand to lose or gain by taking down my son.

213
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:15,690
Make your decision. Either rip up the photo and leave the USB here,

214
00:22:15,690 --> 00:22:20,540
or... get up and leave.

215
00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:12,130
Put Cheon Jong Beom on the suspect list for Im Hwa Yeong's case. I'm starting the investigation from square one.

216
00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:16,170
   

217
00:23:31,290 --> 00:23:35,410
How was he today? Did he look for me?

218
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:37,740
I was going to tell you, actually.

219
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:41,220
His mind was clear today,

220
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:44,240
so he wrote a lot of things down.

221
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:47,520
He did the same when I was young.

222
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:52,890
He would sit on the sofa and write things down again and again.

223
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:25,270
 April 9th, 2020, a woman came to see me. 

224
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:29,530
The 9th? That was the day...

225
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:35,320
 She said someone was going to kill my daughter. 

226
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:46,070
 A woman who plays the violin... A woman with a piercing voice... 

227
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:48,730
 Her eyes scared me. 

228
00:24:53,470 --> 00:24:57,550
 Gong Ji Cheol... it's him. 

229
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:45,560
 I need someone to help my daughter. 

230
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:12,770
 Sa Bin, remember two pairs of eyes. 

231
00:26:12,770 --> 00:26:18,370
 The eyes that are coming to kill you, and those that are coming to save you. 

232
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:32,140
   

233
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:35,080
   

234
00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:48,730
♫   Yeah maybe I   ♫

235

237
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:02,550
♫   I guess I left a long way   ♫

238
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:08,630
♫   But I   ♫

239
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:11,820
Why is she sitting there like an alcoholic?

240
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:13,770
You go over there.

241
00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:16,410
♫   All those dreams   ♫

242
00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:20,260
What's perfect right now is... to leave her alone.

243
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:22,960
She was just like that at 14.

244
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:27,990
Back then, she drank pineapple Coolpis all night.

245
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:31,110
But she has a low tolerance for alcohol. What is she trying to do?

246
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:34,800
You don't know. That's not true.

247
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:38,820
Sa Bin is like me, so she can drink like a fish.

248
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:40,970
That's not helpful right now.

249
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:52,660
♫   Only that is my world   ♫

250
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:20,270
 If you stay near Kim Soo Hyeok, both you and your father will die. 

251
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:47,800
 Prosecutor Kim, I know I'm overstepping my bounds, 

252
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:50,600
  and I also know I shouldn't be doing this, 

253
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,170
 but don't get hurt. 

254
00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:55,710
 Please don't get hurt. 

255
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:58,330
What are you doing? Have you been drinking?

256
00:28:58,330 --> 00:29:02,020
Who sent that note?

257
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:06,020
Me and my dad and you...

258
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:10,400
 the person who's trying to kill all of us, who is it? 

259
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:14,480
Who's trying to kill you?

260
00:29:16,770 --> 00:29:21,090
How much did you drink? Let me talk to whoever you're with.

261
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:23,110
Are you alone right now?

262
00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:29,460
You looked down on me for not knowing judo, taekwondo, or hapkido.

263
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:32,210
 But you don't fight with skills. 

264
00:29:32,210 --> 00:29:36,780
You do it with your heart. The heart.

265
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:42,200
I'm not scared of knives, I'm not scared of guns.

266
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:47,570
I only see the person I need to protect.

267
00:29:47,570 --> 00:29:49,440
Where are you?

268
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,310
Tell me what signs you see in front of you.

269
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:58,060
   

270
00:29:58,060 --> 00:30:00,980
 The person you called cannot answer the phone... 

271
00:30:05,530 --> 00:30:08,220
   

272
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:10,680
Where's Jeong Sa Bin right now?

273
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:17,580
It's falling like snow.

274
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:47,760

285
00:33:24,510 --> 00:33:26,170
 Wasn't I the one you wanted to kill?  

286
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:28,210
 No one can give another a motive for murder. 

287
00:33:28,210 --> 00:33:29,280
 I can't stop myself. 

288
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:32,240
 This is the first time I've wanted to kill because I liked someone. 

289
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,990
 Do you think it's also a coincidence that the diary disappeared? 

290
00:33:34,990 --> 00:33:36,590
 The tattoo artist is the murderer! 

291
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:38,780
 If you wait and see, you'll find out who's protecting you. 

292
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:41,800
 There's someone I want to protect. Let's break off the engagement. 

293
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:44,600
 Because I love you, Jeong Sa Bin.
