1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:04,040
   

2
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:06,780
What am I going to do?

3
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:09,970
There are no phones here either...

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:19,050
 Timing and Subtitles by the Reborn Team @ viki 

5
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:32,210
   

6
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:35,640
There are bastards like that...

7
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:39,850
Bastards where just the way their face looks makes you want to harass them.

8
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:42,000
Seong Woo was like that.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,410
Just like the way you look now.

10
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:48,610
Even while he was bleeding to death, he called me "Mommy."

11
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:50,590
"Mommy?"

12
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,730
It's nothing...

13
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:59,390
But when he begged me, I wanted to say, "No."

14
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:03,450
You were like that, too. Weren't you?

15
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:06,020
You look like you've lived your life begging.

16
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:09,890
But why me?

17
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:13,670
Kill your own mom, you good-for-nothing beggar!

18
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:25,190
Help! Save me please!

19
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:27,610
Save me please!

20
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:42,960
Go...

21
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:47,030
and beg Seong Woo to forgive you.

22
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:54,110
 You will certainly murder. 

23
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:58,460
 Once you start, you won't be able to stop. 

24
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:07,240
 It isn't bad to be hurt. 

25
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:12,170
 The one who's bad is the one who hurt you. 

26
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:08,840
 Brain death and cardiac death are different. The brain is dead but the heart could be beating. 

27
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:13,810
 The brain is dead but the heart is beating. 

28
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:23,440
 Declaration of Brain Death. Inability to breathe independently. 

29
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,290
 Parietal dilatation of both eyes. 

30
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:29,620
 In a coma that is 

31
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:33,190
 not responsive to external stimuli... 

32
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,440
No...

33
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:54,130
 12/1987 

34
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,660
Yes, this is "Love Salon,"

35
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:06,370
there is someone who is hurt.

36
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:23,850
This is where the sound came from... 
   

37
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:02,930
   

38
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,910
 This is the police. 

39
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:09,560
There's been a mur-murder.

40
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,920
 Hello? 

41
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:15,240
I-I saw his face.

42
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,580
 Where are you? 

43
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:43,450
Excuse me! Doctor!

44
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:45,880
Doctor, she's been like this for 20 minutes.

45
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:49,660
No. It's been around 15 minutes.

46
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,010
Please, please hurry and save her.

47
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:54,930
Please come this way.

48
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:11,060
Stop CPR. Mask.

49
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:58,390
Hyeong Bin.

50
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:50,940
 This is Jeong Ha Eun. 

51
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:54,420
 I'm out right now. If you have a message— 

52
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:56,400
- Yes? 
 -  This is Jeong Ha Eun's house, right? 

53
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,610
This is Saint Peter's Hospital.

54
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:00,440
Did something happen to Ha Eun?

55
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:03,300
You sound like Jeong Ha Eun's guardian.

56
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:07,070
Jeong Ha Eun came into the emergency room a moment ago.

57
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,890
    
 - Ha Eun!

58
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:12,990
Jeong Ha Eun!

59
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:20,170
Where were you? You weren't at the bookstore or at your house. Where—

60
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:23,880
I lived, Hyeong Bin. I'm alive.

61
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:26,920
You held my hand and didn't let go.

62
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:32,450
You were holding it so hard. The grim reaper let me go.

63
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:34,920
He lost. He told me to just go to you.

64
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:37,760
Your hand? Me?

65
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,800
You were holding my hand this entire time, until a minute ago.

66
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:46,940
Hyeong Bin, it's so strange. I'm weirdly fine. Watch this.

67
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:54,810
The hospital smell doesn't make me nauseous anymore. I don't smell the formaldehyde from the dead bodies.

68
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,680
It's the first time since I was born.

69
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:01,190
Fifty meters, I mean about 70 meters?

70
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:06,690
Today, I ran that far. But it's a miracle I'm still alive.

71
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:08,450
You ran?

72
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:12,710
Why? Why'd you run?

73
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:15,510
- What? 
 - I said why'd you run?

74
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:18,380
- The thing is ... 
 - Tell me.

75
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,890
 There's just been a yellow umbrella murder. Over! 

76
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:27,810
 The beauty salon's name is "Love Salon." Over.  

77
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:30,480
All right. Over.

78
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:40,230
Ha Eun, listen to me closely. You can't do anything alone anymore. Okay?

79
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:43,830
Wait at the hospital. You can't take a single step until I come for you.

80
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:44,980
But I—

81
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:46,730
Please listen to me.

82
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:49,640
Then take me to the police station, Hyeong Bin.

83
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,000
Police station?

84
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,640
Yeah. I'll wait for you there.

85
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:56,480
That's okay, right?

86
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:04,770
Thank you, Doctor.

87
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:09,480
Of course. The man who brought Jeong Ha Eun to the emergency room before,

88
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,630
do you know him?

89
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:13,280
A man?

90
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,700
That man had blood smeared on him here and there,

91
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,690
and carried Jeong Ha Eun here in his arms.

92
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:18,960
What did he look like?

93
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,340
I know him.

94
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:22,520
He's a guardian for a patient in the ICU.

95
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,320
I consulted on the patient.

96
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,500
Above his left eye, he has a scar.

97
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:29,960
Do you know his name?

98
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:32,420
It said Gong Ji Cheol

99
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:35,200
on the chart. Bye.

100
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:42,600
 You were holding my hand this entire time, until a minute ago. 

101
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,210
   

102
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:10,830
 That bastard's after Ha Eun. 

103
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:16,560
   

104
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:22,100
Oh my goodness! Aigoo! Look at the blood!

105
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,170
1987. December 14th.

106
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:45,950
The 11th time.

107
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:48,710
This time, couldn't it be a copycat?

108
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:52,820
He only used knives the last ten times, this yellow umbrella murderer.

109
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:55,430
He's never hit anyone with a blunt weapon.

110
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:58,510
If it was a copycat, they would have used a knife.

111
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:10,140
How could this happen? What's going on?

112
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:15,260
Excuse me. That pen... We also have them.

113
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:19,040
Oh, no, oh my goodness. What happened?

114
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:21,450
- This? 
 - Yes.

115
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:23,950
Buyeon Elementary School?

116
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:26,180
It's a school opening anniversary pen.

117
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:28,920
On the other side, there's an acupuncture needle.

118
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,060
Is it a clue?

119
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:31,730
Where is Buyeon Elementary School?

120
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:36,040
That school... was closed four years ago.

121
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:41,030
In Do, go to the police station and watch over Ha Eun.

122
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,450
He goes by himself again.

123
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,160
One,

124
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,940
two,

125
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:14,420
three,

126
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:21,940
four,

127
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:25,440
seven, eight, nine,

128
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:29,070
ten.

129
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:37,990
 One guy kills them and another guy buries them. 

130
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:39,700
No.

131
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:43,120
One bastard kills them

132
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:46,610
and another bastard paints them.

133
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:51,180
 The pain you get from the woman you love 

134
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:56,840
 probably doesn't compare to the pain from when you were stabbed in the eye. 

135
00:14:56,840 --> 00:15:00,420
 Will your murderous instinct leave that woman alone? 

136
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:02,770
 I'm different from you. 

137
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:06,550
 It doesn't matter whether that woman doesn't love me. 

138
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:09,460
 I'm going to complete my love 

139
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:11,850
 in my own way. 

140
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:15,480
 My first prediction was right. 

141
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:18,030
 But the next one isn't, right? 

142
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:21,070
 If you want to protect that girl, 

143
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:24,320
 don't drag that girl into your fate. 

144
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,510
That girl...

145
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:46,230
won't ever die.

146
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:51,440
I'll make sure

147
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:55,190
to save her.

148
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:59,430
I'll make sure

149
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,600
to save her.

150
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:14,210
Is the murderer you witnessed

151
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:16,280
this man?

152
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:27,950
Detective Cha! Ha Eun said she saw the yellow umbrella murderer killing the woman at the salon!

153
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:30,190
We finally have a witness!

154
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:32,530
Who knew it'd be Ha Eun...

155
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:37,790
- Let's go. 
 - Detective Cha!

156
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:40,730
Hyeong Bin, why are you doing this?

157
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:43,020
This case doesn't have a witness

158
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:45,340
and Ha Eun didn't see anything.

159
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:51,800
Hyeong Bin.

160
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,510
Ha Eun, look at me.

161
00:16:57,510 --> 00:16:59,980
Now, I'm not a detective that protects other people.

162
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:03,710
I'm only going to protect you. That's all I'm going to do.

163
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:07,070
To protect you, besides quitting my job,

164
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:09,140
I would murder for you.

165
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:12,430
Nice. Is that something a detective should say?

166
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:15,030
That bastard is after you.

167
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:16,210
That bastard?

168
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:19,860
The bastard who killed 11 women is near you. Do you know that?

169
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:21,100
What does that mean—

170
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:22,970
Let's go. I'll take you home.

171
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:25,890
Starting now, you won't be alone for one second.

172
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:33,740
You know how to use it, right?

173
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:37,140
From now on, call me through this. Keep it on 24 hours a day. Got it?

174
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:39,740
Got it. Over.

175
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:40,890
Go first.

176
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:43,880
Go in, I'm going to stand guard.

177
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:47,390
You want me to sleep while you're standing guard?

178
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:50,320
Hurry up and go inside.

179
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:54,130
Okay. Over.

180
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,650
Lock your windows.

181
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:20,940
Since you're here, listen to this and practice.

182
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:25,090
You say it's your favorite song, but you always sing it wrong. Here.

183
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:58,320
    
♫  I saw you in my dream last night  ♫

184
00:18:58,330 --> 00:19:05,570
♫  I can't forget you whose name I do not know  ♫

185
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:09,140
♫  I have never seen you before  ♫

186
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:13,640
♫  And I don't know your name  ♫

187
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:16,800
♫  My love who came in my dream last night  ♫

188
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:21,550
♫  My love who came in my dream last night  ♫

189
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:23,730
♫  Tonight...  ♫

190
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:28,870
♫  when I think about it carefully,  ♫

191
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:32,110
♫  You look familiar as though I've seen you somewhere  ♫

192
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:35,880
♫  You look familiar as though I've seen you somewhere  ♫

193
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:39,240
   
♫  I remember how you looked  ♫

194
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:44,070
♫  My love that I had forgotten  ♫

195
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:51,640
♫  My lover whom I had met in my previous years  ♫

196
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:58,620
♫  The one I had met in the autumn  ♫

197
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:01,050
♫  If I open my eyes  ♫

198
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:06,090
♫  I'm afraid I'd wake up from my dream  ♫

199
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:13,620
♫  So I can't open my eyes and I get to see you again  ♫

200
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:15,330
♫  Like a dream  ♫

201
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:17,290
He can't be stopped.

202
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:21,530
♫  I keep dreaming of my dream  ♫

203
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:26,240
♫  Tonight, I say goodbye to you  ♫

204
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:29,340
 Where are you? Over. Answer me. Over. 

205
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:32,290
I'm going to the public bathhouse. Over. I have to wash my body. Over.

206
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:36,070
I'll be out of contact for one hour. Over.

207
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:50,240
   

208
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:38,150
Gong Ji Cheol.

209
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:41,120
Is it that guy?

210
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,810
He's over there. Look.

211
00:21:42,810 --> 00:21:44,700
It's a police officer.

212
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:47,230
 - Is it him? 
- It's a cop. 

213
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:02,230
If you move, I'll fire this gun.

214
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:28,470
Gong Ji Cheol, you are being arrested for the murder of ten women besides Yoon Jeong Hui.

215
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:34,140
Murderous bastard.

216
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:39,880
Get up!

217
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:43,430
Now, let's go quietly, all right?

218
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:55,500
Gong Ji Cheol...

219
00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:03,230
 We have to work fast. 

220
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,400
 What are you doing right now? 

221
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:11,750
 Did you come here to read? 

222
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:30,210
 It's not bad to be hurt. 

223
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:37,580
 The one who's bad is the one who hurt you. 

224
00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:43,870
 In your next life, I hope you're born without people to hurt you. 

225
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:46,650
 Where are you trying to enter? 

226
00:23:46,650 --> 00:23:49,000
 Back off. 

227
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,280
   

228
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,890
   

229
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:57,780
Detective Cha is protecting a witness right now.

230
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:01,650
But do you think this guy is the real culprit?

231
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:06,290
Gong Ji Cheol is denying all other crimes except for the salon incident.

232
00:24:06,290 --> 00:24:11,730
What people want isn't the real culprit. It's a criminal.

233
00:24:11,730 --> 00:24:14,830
 Aigoo... 

234
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:16,220
Get him!

235
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:17,790
Grab him!

236
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:21,650
I just feel like the evidence isn't enough right now.

237
00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:24,400
Evidence?

238
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:29,040
Tell Detective Cha Hyeong Bin to convince the witness to testify.

239
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:32,390
I'll make sure that this bastard is hanged.

240
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:37,940
 Beat him to death. 

241
00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:40,820
 Beat him. 

242
00:24:57,420 --> 00:25:00,330
 I know bastards like this. 

243
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:05,110
 He hurts himself if he doesn't commit murder. 

244
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:09,610
 He wants to die... because he can't kill more people. 

245
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:35,770
 Even if you don't kill her, she'll die soon. 

246
00:25:35,770 --> 00:25:39,200
 If you want, I can send her off comfortably. 

247
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:44,160
Is your 12th target for murder... this girl?

248
00:25:48,430 --> 00:25:53,690
You quit middle school so there's no way you were taught how to paint. Who is your accomplice who painted this?

249
00:25:54,410 --> 00:25:59,160
The man you said is the real culprit, Gong In Woo. He died 15 years ago.

250
00:25:59,930 --> 00:26:04,610
He's never been married and naturally, he didn't have a son.

251
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:11,110
This painting. The woman reading the book. Who is it?

252
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,700
That bookstore.

253
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:18,190
I went to it a lot.

254
00:26:18,190 --> 00:26:20,610
"Old Future."

255
00:26:20,610 --> 00:26:22,390
What?

256
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:27,960
When you open the door, a music box plays.

257
00:26:29,050 --> 00:26:34,510
 On the counter, there's a picture of Jeong Ha Eun's family. 

258
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:38,870
 She likes tangerines, that girl. 

259
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:41,550
That's why she makes tangerine tea for herself.

260
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:46,380
How long have you been following Ha Eun?

261
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:50,240
I'm not sure. I haven't been counting so I don't know.

262
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:58,510
But before you met Jeong Ha Eun... I went to her bookstore.

263
00:26:58,510 --> 00:27:01,100
I know her better than you do.

264
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:05,390
How that girl smiles, how she gets angry.

265
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:11,440
How she has a habit of closing one eye when she eats a sour tangerine.

266
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:17,060
 How she looks when she looks at the man she loves...  

267
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:25,110
Wuthering Heights.

268
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:30,970
You don't even know whether the paragraph she likes is on page 73 or page 123.

269
00:27:30,970 --> 00:27:32,140
You...

270
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:35,870
All you can do is promise to marry a girl who may die at any moment.

271
00:27:35,870 --> 00:27:39,120
In that situation, you want to protect her, don't you?

272
00:27:47,690 --> 00:27:54,300
Sure. You're right. Ha Eun may die at any moment.

273
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:58,970
She lost both her parents in a car accident and she grew up as an orphan.

274
00:27:58,970 --> 00:28:01,900
You know what an orphan is, don't you?

275
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:04,790
No one is born a murderer.

276
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:10,050
The people who ruined you and made you like this... Isn't it unfair?

277
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:19,560
It's not too late.

278
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:23,650
There are a lot of prisoners who turn over a new leaf and live as new people.

279
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:31,640
I'm not saying this as a detective. I'm saying this as Ha Eun's guardian.

280
00:28:32,570 --> 00:28:38,270
End your twisted fate with Ha Eun. Start a new life for yourself even though it's late.

281
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,590
A new life...

282
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:50,130
I want that, too,

283
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:57,060
but imprison me as many times as you want.

284
00:28:57,060 --> 00:29:02,070
Even if I die, I'll go find that girl. No matter what.

285
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:09,320
You. You asked me why?

286
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:13,620
That's the only reason I'm still hanging onto my life.

287
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:19,890
So you're saying

288
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:25,250
that killing Ha Eun is your reason for living.

289
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:36,490
Murder isn't something only you can do.

290
00:29:36,490 --> 00:29:40,350
If you even look at Ha Eun, I'll kill you.

291
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:42,370
Got it?

292
00:30:34,130 --> 00:30:39,750
 “If all else perished, and he remained, I should still continue to be." 

293
00:30:57,140 --> 00:31:00,180
   

294
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:03,600
   

295
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:06,110
   

296
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:10,020
   

297
00:31:22,650 --> 00:31:25,640
Even if your body dies,

298
00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:28,340
your soul

299
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:33,010
- is 
 -  "Even if your body dies, 

300
00:31:33,010 --> 00:31:36,220
 your soul is born again. 

301
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:39,910
 You can be born again. 

302
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:55,480
   

303
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:57,190
   

304
00:31:57,190 --> 00:31:59,640
   

305
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:08,940
