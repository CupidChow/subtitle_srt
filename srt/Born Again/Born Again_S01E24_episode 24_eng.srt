1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:03,610
   

2
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:34,790
Cheon Jong Beom.

3
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:38,920
 Kim Soo Hyeok. The bullet in your head is from that punk. 

4
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:40,820
How did you...

5
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:42,050
How did you live?

6
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:45,300
You seem disappointed that I survived.

7
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:48,980
Can I ask the reason why you shot me?

8
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:50,530
The reason?

9
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:56,920
Okay. Since you tried to kill Jeong Sa Bin.

10
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:00,610
I tried to kill Jeong Sa Bin?

11
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:05,870
You still treat me like a murderer.

12
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:07,210
Aren't you?

13
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:11,250
The only person I killed was Yoon Jeong Hee.

14
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:13,160
Yoon Jeong Hee?

15
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:19,460
 December 14, 1987, Yoon Jeong Hee. 

16
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:21,500
 11th time... 

17
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:31,400
Cha Hyeong Bin, look into my eyes.

18
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:34,270
I recognize you,

19
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:37,130
so why can't you recognize me?

20
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:42,670
The murderer 32 years ago was Gong In Woo.

21
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:48,740
If you want to know the truth, go catch Gong In Woo.

22
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:53,550
Gong In Woo? How do you know...

23
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:56,520
Stop right there.

24
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,790
Who are you?

25
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,790
Do you still suspect Jong Beom as a murderer?

26
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:10,120
This is not for you toâ€”

27
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:14,380
Let's speak later, Prosecutor Kim.

28
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:20,790
Hold on.

29
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:24,880
Do you still have something left to say to Jong Beom?

30
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:47,980
 I found out where Gang Doo Cheol stores his paintings. 

31
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:51,030
 But someone is here right now. 

32
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,740
Why are you here in that state?

33
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:11,490
But are you really Detective Cha?

34
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:14,990
Then tell me the first criminal we arrested together.

35
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:18,730
Park Sang Moon: serial rapist and murderer.

36
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:22,480
Then, what's the name of the rice soup place in front of our police station?

37
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,530
Let's go in.

38
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:26,610
See? You're not Detective Cha, are you?

39
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:28,550
Little Grandma Rice Soup.

40
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:31,480
You went out with her second daughter.

41
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,820
Were you a detective before you became a prosecutor?

42
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:34,820
When?

43
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:36,930
Since way before you were born.

44
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:40,710
Hold on. Then this...

45
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:44,830
Here, have one each.

46
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:50,590
Before we arrested a criminal, we always did this.

47
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:11,650
There are a total of 30 paintings stored here by the Yuhon Gallery.

48
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:14,980
Of those, 11 are the personal property of Gang Doo Cheol.

49
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:19,520
From here to there, are the paintings we're storing for Yuhon Gallery.

50
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:22,450
You can take your time and look around.

51
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:33,500
I brought the UV light with me.

52
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:48,570
Why don't I see anything here, Detective Cha?

53
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:50,390
Move aside.

54
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:17,950
These are...

55
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:23,530
The paintings that were all destroyed after Gong Ji Cheol was executed... how are they all...

56
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:28,770
Why does Gang Doo Cheol have Gong Ji Cheol's paintings?

57
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:31,820
I've been curious about that for years.

58
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:37,920
How did Gong Ji Cheol paint like this when he didn't even graduate high school?

59
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:42,330
 The murderer 32 years ago was Gong In woo. 

60
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:49,970
 If you want to know the truth, go catch Gong In Woo. 

61
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:52,760
You tail Gang Doo Cheol.

62
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,660
Yes, Sir.

63
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:05,610
Oh, Detective Cha, I have something to tell you.

64
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:11,100
That day at the gallery, the person who stabbed me was a woman.

65
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:13,560
- A woman? 
 - Yes.

66
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:16,150
Not a man, a woman.

67
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:26,650
 Do you still have something left to say to Jong Beom? 

68
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:34,370
Where should we go?

69
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,230
Should we go to the place where we first met?

70
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,370
Where we first met?

71
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:41,260
The place where you tried to sell me the book at a high price.

72
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:44,200
Where was that?

73
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,620
I can't remember.

74
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:54,050
You will when we get there. You scribbled in the book with a pen.

75
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:59,650
I didn't tell you before, but I can't forget how you were then. You left such an impression.

76
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:06,590
   

77
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:15,660
   

78
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:22,680
I guess I like scribbling with a pen.

79
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,960
So where is that place?

80
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:30,380
So it's...

81
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:33,490
First, go straight.

82
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,920
I have a question.

83
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:50,440
When I got shot, why were you there, Professor?

84
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,320
I want to know what happened that day.

85
00:07:56,320 --> 00:08:02,470
Not from someone else but from you, Prof... I mean, Senior.

86
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,960
I got a text.

87
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,990
That you might kill.

88
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:16,420
Did I try to kill you?

89
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:22,290
No. You... tried to save me.

90
00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:35,850
   

91
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:38,610
   

92
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:43,790
This book, Gong Ji Cheol, the serial murderer...

93
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:47,910
When my dad worked as a prison guard, the first person he electrocuted was Gong Ji Cheol.

94
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:52,170
Prison guard? What was his name?

95
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:56,200
My dad? Officer Jeong Seong Eun.

96
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,220
Jeong Seong Eun?

97
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:20,300
Sometimes I get curious whether Gong Ji Cheol could gain redemption.

98
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:33,290
I'm sure he wanted it, since he was a human being, too.

99
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:37,800
But... the Gong Ji Cheol in this book,

100
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,700
- is it the real Gong Ji Cheol? 
 - Hm?

101
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:43,630
He could have been wrongly accused.

102
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:48,370
Since the dead can't speak. Like the remains of that convict.

103
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:52,700
You're right. It's possible to have a wrongful conviction,

104
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:56,550
but not Gong Ji Cheol.

105
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:59,960
Since he's a devil my dad witnessed himself.

106
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:02,910
Devil?

107
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:12,230
 The prosecution is unable to find out the identity of the convict. 

108
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,830
Hold on.

109
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:20,130
Jay, can we restore another face?

110
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:22,190
 Who is it this time? 

111
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:23,770
Oh, it's an unidentified convict.

112
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:27,490
 Convict? Okay. Let's take a look in the autopsy room. 

113
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:29,690
I'll be right over.

114
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:32,510
Sorry, I have to get back to the NFS.

115
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:34,740
I'll take you.

116
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:09,430
Can you find out writer Jang Hye Mi's address?

117
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:11,090
The one who wrote "The Murderer's Secret"?

118
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:13,120
 Of course, I can. Why? 

119
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,230
There's something I held back from saying for 30 years.

120
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:29,390
 28-1 Jangan-ro, Joong-gu, Seoul 

121
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:33,860
   

122
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:02,960
   

123
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,240
You're amazing.

124
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:08,980
If strangers saw you, they'd think writer Jang Hye Mi lost weight

125
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:11,640
because of her daughter's broken engagement.

126
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:19,210
Suffering with you doesn't break your engagement.

127
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:28,150
Maybe you should take this opportunity and diet, too.

128
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:46,100
What brings you here without calling first?

129
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:50,390
I heard you were in the U.S. Have you been in Korea?

130
00:12:56,060 --> 00:13:00,590
Sang Ah, you go in the room. He's my guest.

131
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:08,830
Let's sit. Do you want tea?

132
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:11,380
Why did you lie to me?  (informally) 

133
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:15,660
You've become rude since I saw you last.

134
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:19,610
Gong In Woo is the one who killed all the women.

135
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:23,010
Gong In Woo...

136
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:28,670
That's a name you could never know.

137
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:32,870
Where did you hear that name?

138
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:36,350
Tell me. The reason you lied.

139
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:40,800
I don't know.

140
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:46,370
Writing usually borders on fact and fiction.

141
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:49,020
Can you tell me?

142
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:54,380
What part is a lie?

143
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:04,460
The address you gave me 32 years ago, the hospital where you said Jeong Ha Eun was...

144
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:09,250
It wasn't where she was, it was where I was going to die.

145
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:40,140
Cheon Jong Beom... those are not his eyes.

146
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:46,700
His eyes are shut. I can't read his emotions.

147
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:52,740
But your eyes... are that of an untamed animal.

148
00:14:53,860 --> 00:15:00,030
I... tend to believe things that can't be understood by human intelligence.

149
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:07,140
But the you in front of me piques my interest.

150
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:14,900
It's been a while, Gong Ji Cheol.

151
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:22,390
But you wouldn't have met her anyway.

152
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:29,450
The Jeong Ha Eun you wanted to meet had already died by then.

153
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:33,430
What?

154
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:36,700
She died?

155
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:48,270
Do you know where your stepfather is buried?

156
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:53,950
I do. Since I was there.

157
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:57,250
The place where Gong In Woo killed your stepfather.

158
00:15:57,250 --> 00:16:00,860
Do you want that corpse to be unearthed?

159
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:06,700
Then it'll be revealed that Jang Hye Mi was the woman who helped Gong In Woo kill her stepfather.

160
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:12,360
Then your book will become proof of your sin.

161
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:15,480
 A woman helped Gong Ji Cheol escape. 

162
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:20,790
 That woman followed Gong Ji Cheol 

163
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:24,630
 who killed her sexually abusive stepfather. 

164
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:29,970
So why did you come to see me?

165
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:34,590
Gong In Woo. Bring him to me right now.

166
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:39,000
If you ignore me, you'll see your stepfather's corpse...

167
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:42,270
You'll see it on the news.

168
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:49,090
Who would believe that a 23-year old medical student

169
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:55,760
is a witness to a murder from 32 years ago?

170
00:16:55,760 --> 00:17:01,120
What do you think I found where your stepfather was buried?

171
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:05,700
Gong In Woo... bring him.

172
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:21,890
   

173
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:35,360
 That woman was Gong Ji Cheol's. 

174
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:41,670
 Inside her, Gong Ji Cheol's child was growing. 

175
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:48,680
 Then it'll be revealed that Jang Hye Mi was the woman who helped Gong In Woo kill her stepfather. 

176
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:50,200
 Then your book will become proof of your sin. 

177
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:12,200
 Then your book will become proof of your sin. 

178
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,060
 Then your book will become proof of your sin. 

179
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:26,330
Teacher, there's someone you need to meet.

180
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:28,650
You need to come back.

181
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:33,960
Yes. I'll meet you there.

182
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:40,660
 Tomorrow at 10:00 p.m., Yuhon Gallery. 

183
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:45,350
 You'll see Gong In Woo there. 

184
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:51,390
What a treacherous fate you have...

185
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:10,850
   

186
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:25,670
He's a convict, but he must have had parents and siblings.

187
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:31,000
No. This convict was abused from a young age.

188
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,990
No one might be looking for him.

189
00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:38,000
But do you have to reconstruct his face when no one is looking for him?

190
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,130
I want to at least put his face on his remains.

191
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:44,190
At least I'll remember him.

192
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:46,430
This convict...

193
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:53,560
 I found the owner of the ring from the Donggang mummy. 

194
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:57,220
Arboretum?

195
00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:25,160
 It would have been nice had they met while alive. I'll bring the ring. 

196
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:28,450
 It's the Donggang mummy's wedding day. 

197
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:32,970
 Since it's his wedding day, I hope the weather is nice. 

198
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:49,020
â™«   Because you were the first to come close   â™«

199
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:55,960
â™«   Even if it's a love I can't fulfill   â™«

200
00:20:57,790 --> 00:21:02,500
â™«   I can't give up this heart of mine   â™«

201
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:07,070
   

202
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:13,510
   

203
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:16,490
 Ha Eun... 

204
00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:22,930
 I came too late, didn't I? 

205
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:29,950
â™«   I wonder if you'll get to know my heart   â™«

206
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:37,600
â™«   Knowing you can't come to me  â™«

207
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:45,460
â™«   I keep thinking about the words I can't say to you   â™«

208
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:51,380
â™«   Even if I wear out from the love lost   â™«

209
00:21:51,380 --> 00:22:00,790
â™«   I'm okay because it's not a goodbye even if it hurts   â™«

210
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:04,910
I'm sorry I'm late, Ha Eun.

211
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:07,310
I'm sorry I'm late...

212
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:16,950
It looks like you're the one getting married.

213
00:22:22,010 --> 00:22:25,560
Prosecutor Kim, why...

214
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:28,720
- Did you bring the ring? 
 - Oh.

215
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,380
Yes.

216
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:59,460
April 3rd, 1983, was the day they first met.

217
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:02,540
Pardon? How do you know that?

218
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:08,650
â™«   I don't want it to become a sad destiny   â™«

219
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:16,250
â™«   That it's only fate  â™«

220
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:21,700
â™«   It remains even in flowing tears   â™«

221
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:25,160
The two of them found each other in the end.

222
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:30,950
â™«   Please let me be by your side  â™«

223
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,510
From now on, they'll be together.

224
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:37,580
â™«   Pain rushes into the heart   â™«

225
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:42,120
Without being apart.

226
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:46,070
He would have wanted to keep his promise to the woman he loved.

227
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:50,060
So he waited, unable to decompose...

228
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:52,580
until her hands touched him.

229
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:09,480
â™«   The memory of you that can't be erased   â™«

230
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:15,030
â™«   So that it won't be sad anymore    â™«

231
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:22,610
â™«   The place that remained far away  â™«

232
00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:29,910
â™«  In that dark and lonely place   â™«

233
00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:37,320
â™«   I'm afraid to be lost again like your dreams   â™«

234
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:44,590
â™«   I'm afraid to be lost again like your dreams   â™«

235
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:52,060
â™«   Please let me be by your side   â™«

236
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:09,220
Prosecutor, Gang Doo Cheol won't even budge, and now the perverted bastard is on the move.

237
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:12,290
He picked someone up near Incheon harbor.

238
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,850
 Tail him closely. I'll be right there. 

239
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:25,940
The teacher is on his way. I have a question.

240
00:25:27,330 --> 00:25:32,130
What are you going to do when you meet your father?

241
00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:35,760
I'm going to wash away my sins.

242
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,050
How?

243
00:25:37,050 --> 00:25:41,850
I'll make him confess his own sins.

244
00:26:00,570 --> 00:26:06,120
Gong Ji Cheol... today is the day you die twice.

245
00:26:09,930 --> 00:26:14,270
I'm following him, but this leads to Yuhon Gallery.

246
00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:15,880
What about the identity of the passenger?

247
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:18,420
I can't see since it's dark inside the car.

248
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:20,390
Keep following them.

249
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:36,480
   

250
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:39,600
 I don't have time for you right now. 

251
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:49,190
 Yuhon Gallery, 11:00 p.m.. 

252
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:51,860
 Come and confirm Gong In Woo in person. 

253
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:25,390
 I lost Gang Doo Cheol. 

254
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:32,430
I got Gang Do Cheol.

255
00:27:54,090 --> 00:28:01,130
 Timing and Subtitles by the Reborn Team @ viki 

256
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:09,360
â™«  Exhausted by bird sounds all night,   â™«

257
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:13,130
â™«   Did you leave and forget   â™«

258
00:28:13,130 --> 00:28:14,690
   

259
00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:16,530
 What is your relationship to Gong In Woo? 

260
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:19,700
 You can live as a devil by yourself. Why drag me in? 

261
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:22,090
 Am I next after Gong In Woo? 

262
00:28:22,090 --> 00:28:25,000
 What is the real secret of the murderer in your book? 

263
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,830
 Just remember that I'm the only one who can confirm that you were wrongly accused. 

264
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:31,340
 I reconstructed the convict's face. Don't they look alike? 

265
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:34,660
 I realized today that Heaven will give me a chance, too. 

266
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:38,240
 I'll tell it one by one. To Prosecutor Kim Soo Hyeok. 

267
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,000
 I had another nightmare that you were shot. 

268
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,770
 My head hurts too much. Can you come? 

269
00:28:43,770 --> 00:28:44,800
â™«   Did you leave   â™«
