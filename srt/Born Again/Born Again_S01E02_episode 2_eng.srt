1
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:04,320
   

2
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:56,170
 Heathcliff was in love. 

3
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:12,860
Hurry up.

4
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:06,220
    

5
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:18,270
"That child was being called by the name Heathcliff.

6
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:22,910
Heathcliff seemed a sullen, patient child;

7
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:26,830
hardened, perhaps, to ill-treatment.

8
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:36,750
It’s as dark almost as if it came from the devil.

9
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:40,580
But he was a dirty, ragged, black-haired child.

10
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:44,890
Heathcliff was not insolent to his benefactor,

11
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:50,150
he was simply insensible; though knowing perfectly the hold he had on his heart."

12
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:55,260
If you sit back there, you probably won't be able to hear.

13
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:57,220
Will you come to the front?

14
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:02,850
- Was Heathcliff a demon? 
- No.

15
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:07,160
Heathcliff was in love.

16
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:20,730
"Heathcliff would stand Hindley’s blows without winking or shedding a tear.

17
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:25,600
This endurance made old Earnshaw furious, when he discovered his son, Hindley,

18
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:30,980
persecuting the poor fatherless child, as he called him.

19
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:34,360
He took to Heathcliff strangely,

20
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:37,220
believing all he said.

21
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:43,760
And petting him up far above Cathy, who was too mischievous,

22
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,580
and wayward for a favorite."

23
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,940
   

24
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:44,850
This book was written by Tolstoy when he was 70 years old.

25
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:49,680
It's a story about how all people have God in their souls and can be resurrected into new people.

26
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,480
   

27
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:56,780
Don't you feel as though you can see Nekhlyudov and Katyusha walking through Siberia on a snowy night?

28
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:58,570
   

29
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:02,300
- Your homework is to write a summary of this book by tomorrow. 
  - Yes, Ma'am. 

30
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:04,610
   

31
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:18,670
This...

32
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:21,940
I wanted to give it to you as a present.

33
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:30,340
This?

34
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:37,960
   

35
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,790
Your smile is nice.

36
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:47,600
Your eyes are pretty, why do you hide them?

37
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:50,450
Don't do that.

38
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:54,280
You can show it. This other half.

39
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:05,040
Show me your other half.

40
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:11,540
It isn't bad to be hurt.

41
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,380
The one who's bad

42
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:27,700
is the one who hurt you.

43
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:34,160
What's your name?

44
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,930
Gong Ji Cheol.

45
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:39,140
Gong Ji Cheol.

46
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,080
In the next life,

47
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,860
I hope you're born into a place without the person who hurt you.

48
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:07,280
 Even if your body dies, your soul is born again. 

49
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,720
 You can be born again. 

50
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:28,290
 Mom, I'm sorry! Please open the door! 

51
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:30,630
 Mom! I won't do that anymore. 

52
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:33,630
 Mom, I'm sorry! Please open the door! 

53
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:38,540
 Mom! Mom! Mom, I'm sorry! Mom!! 

54
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:42,460
 I won't do that again! 

55
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:46,130
 Please open the door, Mom! 

56
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:49,790
 Mom! Please open the door! I won't do it ever again! 

57
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:52,940
 Mom! I'm sorry! Please open the door! 

58
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:56,780
 Mom! Mom! 

59
00:07:56,780 --> 00:08:00,780
 Please open the door! I'm sorry! 

60
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:04,620
 Please open the door! Mom! 

61
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:09,570
 Mom! Please open the door! 

62
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:15,510
 I won't do that again. I'm sorry! Mom! Mom! 

63
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:21,210
Big Brother! Did you buy me ice cream? What about shrimp crackers?

64
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,680
Here.

65
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:46,810
- Is it yummy? 
 - Yeah! But Big Brother,

66
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:50,130
Mom said that she picked me up off the street.

67
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:55,400
- You were picked up from the street? 
 - Mom and Dad have blood type AB but I have blood type O.

68
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:59,370
It's something that couldn't have happened if she gave birth to me. I guess she's not my real mom.

69
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:03,300
Right, Big Brother? Then, where's my real mom?

70
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:08,540
You don't need a mom.

71
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:13,010
You can just be born again.

72
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:18,490
So you...

73
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:22,370
pick your mom, okay?

74
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:27,220
Someone you like. Like ice cream.

75
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:32,090
Big Brother, I'm good at that song you taught me.

76
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:33,930
You're good?

00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:09,410
 What's going on? Please tell us! 

87
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:15,900
 Wait, what's going on? What's happening? 

88
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:20,510
 Hey! Come here. 

89
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:22,960
 Hey, they're coming out! 

90
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:25,090
 What is that? 

91
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:29,270
What's wrong with him? Is he sick?

92
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:31,110
Seong Woo, I'm here.

93
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:34,060
He's dead. A robber broke in yesterday.

94
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:39,510
- A robber? 
- Move!

95
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:51,560
Seong Woo...

96
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:14,160
Seong Woo...

97
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:43,230
 Why are you crying again? Die! Die! 

98
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:47,200
 Why aren't you listening? 

99
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,220
 How could I be your mom? 

100
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:58,920
  Big Brother... 

101
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,930
 Me too... 

102
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:03,380
 I'm scared, too. 

103
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:06,580
 - Seong Woo. 
 - Big Brother! Me too! 

104
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:08,940
 Big Brother! 

105
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,920
 I told you to kill them. 

106
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:15,310
 Kill them. 

107
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:18,670
 Kill them! 

108
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:35,640
 It isn't bad to be hurt. 

109
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:38,370
 The one who's bad... 

110
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:40,400
 is the one who hurt you. 

111
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:13,670
 Just get in the car. 

112
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,000
Next.

113
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,730
Next. Next. Raise your head.

114
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:21,320
Next.

115
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:31,170
Ah, he's just in a drugged state.  Take him away.

116
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:33,110
He said that he's the serial murderer.

117
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:35,550
He probably killed them in his head after he took drugs.

118
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:36,760
Next!

119
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,620
What do you people know?

120
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:40,820
You people... know about reaching Nirvana?

121
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:43,440
I'm in the sky!

122
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,270
Hurry up and take him away! Next!

123
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:51,620
- Come here. 
- I'm in the sky! I'm in the sky!

124
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:55,900
- I'm in the sky! 
 - Stop it. Stop it!

125
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:04,150
Detective Cha! A call came for you!

126
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:05,790
Jeong Ha Eun is in the hospital!

127
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:07,430
When?

128
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:11,890
Detective Cha! Do you know which hospital it is?

129
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:17,540
Her condition isn't good.

130
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:19,720
She doesn't take care of herself well either.

131
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:23,990
Still. Because someone found her quickly and brought her to the hospital,

132
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:26,360
so her life was saved.

133
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:31,650
Ha Eun looks uncomfortable because of the oxygen mask.

134
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:34,790
She doesn't like putting things on her body.

135
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:38,150
Which is why she doesn't even wear gloves.

136
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:43,930
Ha Eun, just a little bit longer.

137
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:50,210
Why is she acting this way?

138
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:56,040
She can't stand the smell of hospitals. She says it smells like formaldehyde.

139
00:15:56,040 --> 00:16:01,000
Fortunately, there is a cardiology professor from America here, who was invited to study here for a year.

140
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,580
Would you like to speak to him?

141
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,610
It's dilated myocardial infarction.

142
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:26,110
It's a disease in the muscles of the heart.

143
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:28,760
There aren't a lot of patients who get transplants,

144
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:33,510
but fortunately, Jeong Ha Eun is a patient who could live with a heart transplant.

145
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:35,210
She might be the first in Korea,

146
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:39,210
but in America, there are a lot of patients with successful heart transplants.

147
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,700
No matter the cost of the surgery, we will do it.

148
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:44,920
There is something more important than the cost.

149
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:45,940
What is it?

150
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:47,510
It's the heart donor.

151
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:51,780
The donor has to be declared brain dead and their family must consent

152
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:53,650
in order for us to do an organ transplant.

153
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:55,630
Organ donor...

154
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:59,290
It's difficult for us to say for certain

155
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:02,480
when we will get an organ donor at our hospital.

156
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,900
We'll wait.

157
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,960
Does Jeong Ha Eun not have a guardian?

158
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:08,220
I am her guardian.

159
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:16,720
Ha Eun is stronger than most people,

160
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:21,430
and I will stay by her side until an organ donor comes.

161
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:25,270
You won't just be staying by her side. You would have to stay by her side 24 hours a day—

162
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:28,620
We're getting married. I'm going to marry her and protect her.

163
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:31,910
Around the clock. By her side.

164
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:43,450
Jeong Ha Eun gets worse every time she comes to the hospital.

165
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:47,300
But to think you can transplant a heart like you do a kidney,

166
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:48,920
it's so cool.

167
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:52,250
The patient in the ICU, Min Hyeong Ho, is brain dead.

168
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:54,290
Aren't they an organ donor?

169
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:57,020
The professor said that the blood type has to match.

170
00:17:57,020 --> 00:18:01,110
Patient Jeong Hae Eun's blood type is AB. Patient Min Hyeong Ho's blood type is O.

171
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:05,310
They can't do the transplant. And that patient's son—

172
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:09,060
 Mom and Dad have blood type AB but I have blood type O. 

173
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:11,380
 They said I'm a child they couldn't have produced. 

174
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:14,020
But I'm a little jealous of Jeong Ha Eun.

175
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:17,480
There's a guy who would marry a girl who could die at any moment.

176
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:19,640
It's really romantic.

177
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:27,900
By chance... are you Min Hyeong Ho's family?

178
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,240
Yes.

179
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:35,630
I heard from the professor.

180
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:37,630
He's your son, isn't he?

181
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:41,660
Would you like to have a cup of coffee with me, for a moment?

182
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:56,000
What does it mean when someone is brain dead?

183
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,190
- Brain dead? 
- If you tell me more in more detail...

184
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:03,500
Brain death means the pupils don't dilate,

185
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:07,370
the patient can't breathe on his own, and there's no brainstem reflex.

186
00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:11,880
To put it simply, he's in a condition where he cannot breathe on his own.

187
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,740
Oh really?

188
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:19,990
Please excuse me for a moment.

189
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:54,760
I'm at Saint Peter's Hospital. Over.

190
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,870
We've passed the critical stage. Over.

191
00:19:56,870 --> 00:20:00,400
As things get better, I'll come back to work. Over.

192
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:24,620
 In your next life, I hope you're born into a place where people don't hurt you. 

193
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,680
Don't die.

194
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:38,810
I'll go and find you a new heart.

195
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,840
Thank you.

196
00:21:57,070 --> 00:21:58,570
 The culprit has long hair! 

197
00:21:58,590 --> 00:22:01,800
 There aren't a lot of men with long hair in Korea! 

198
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:10,660
You're awake?

199
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:12,710
Let's go home, Hyeong Bin.

200
00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:15,360
You know I don't like the smell of hospitals.

201
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,510
It smells like dead bodies.

202
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:22,350
Does it remind you of your parents?

203
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:24,190
I feel like I'm going to throw up.

204
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:26,530
Then throw up. Let's go to the bathroom.

205
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:27,910
I know!

206
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:31,040
They said I have to get a heart transplant to live.

207
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:33,910
Waiting here and waiting at home are the same thing.

208
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:36,320
Let's please leave.

209
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:41,970
Oh! Ha Eun!

210
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:45,300
You look healthier than me!

211
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:49,280
Detective Joo, please hurry and take him.

212
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:54,500
You said you had to protect the country. You said protecting the country was protecting me.

213
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:58,690
But you don't catch the bad guys and you're crying in front of me instead.

214
00:22:58,690 --> 00:23:02,020
It's really unattractive.

215
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,560
When did I cry?

216
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:10,670
Oh right. The yellow umbrella serial killer. I came to tell you that someone saw the sketch of his face and sent us a tip.

217
00:23:10,670 --> 00:23:12,010
- A tip? 
- Yes.

218
00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:15,130
You said you were going to keep staying here

219
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:18,970
so I brought her here. The informant.

220
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:23,860
He was burning a yellow umbrella.

221
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:27,520
He covered his face with his hair like this.

222
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:31,670
The young man's face was... how should I put it?

223
00:23:31,670 --> 00:23:33,730
His face looked like he was possessed by a ghost.

224
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:35,410
Where is the incinerating place located?

225
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:39,300
The thing is... he's a young man I know. And I know where he lives.

226
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:42,970
I went to his house a couple of times to evangelize to him.

227
00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:44,580
It looked like he lives alone.

228
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:47,460
Ma'am, are you in a cult?

229
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:53,260
A person's a person! How can you say that someone is possessed by a ghost? What kind of ghost has possessed me?

230
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:56,810
Let's see, let's see. It looks like an oppressed ghost!

231
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:58,050
Satan, away with you!

232
00:23:58,050 --> 00:24:02,780
What is this? My name is ... Joo In Do, woman!

233
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:05,530
Go watch Ha Eun's hospital room.

234
00:24:05,530 --> 00:24:08,700
So she can't leave.

235
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:10,010
Yes.

236
00:24:10,010 --> 00:24:13,000
- We should go.
 - Yes, let's go.

237
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,450
Come this way.

238
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:20,350
Here. It's here.

239
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:25,110
He was burning yellow umbrellas, right here.

240
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:36,110
Where is the house?

241
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:40,720
It's close. There. It's that way.

242
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,480
Declaration of Brain Death...

243
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,550
In a coma that is not responsive to external stimuli...

244
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:03,430
Inability to breathe independently.

245
00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:06,070
Parietal dilatation of both eyes.

246
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:08,990
Blood circulation throughout the body could be normal.

247
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:11,750
The spinal cord reflex movement could occur.

248
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:14,430
The condition of the brain is different from that of the heart.

249
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:18,580
Brain dead and heart dead are different.

250
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:21,300
The brain can be dead while the heart is alive.

251
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:23,940
The condition of the brain is different from that of the heart.

252
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:33,880
The brain is dead but the heart is beating.

253
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:44,930
   

254
00:26:58,870 --> 00:27:02,900
   

255
00:27:07,450 --> 00:27:14,790
I went to your house and noticed that you were tailed by some newbie detective.

256
00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:16,970
Did you kill someone?

257
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:22,790
It's because of you that it's like this. Didn't you think you would eventually get caught?

258
00:27:22,790 --> 00:27:27,210
I'm going on a boat tonight. I'm leaving Korea.

259
00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:31,120
This will probably be the last time I see you.

260
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,480
That's a relief.

261
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:37,390
Ji Cheol, never...

262
00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:42,750
blame yourself in any situation.

263
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:45,900
It's not your fault.

264
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:49,140
Everything is Heaven's fault.

265
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:50,750
 Heaven? 

266
00:27:51,890 --> 00:27:55,640
No. For me, it's all my fault.

267
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:58,660
I'm going to embrace it all and live with it.

268
00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:04,850
Killing people like you. Shamelessly blaming the heavens.

269
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:08,350
I will never live like that.

270
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:30,830
Hye Mi, take care of that child. Until the end.

271
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:35,910
The detective knows about that house, so find a new place for Ji Cheol to live.

272
00:28:35,910 --> 00:28:38,060
Yes, Sir.

273
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:18,970
Gong Ji Cheol.

274
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:27,260
   

275
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,930
   

276
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:39,040
 Will you be my wife, Jeong Ha Eun? 

277
00:30:25,130 --> 00:30:26,810
 She kept throwing up. 

278
00:30:26,810 --> 00:30:33,000
Her stomach was in such bad shape. I did take her to her bookstore.

279
00:30:40,510 --> 00:30:42,350
   

280
00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:45,750
- Please come more often! 
 - Okay!

281
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:47,750
Goodbye!

282
00:30:48,670 --> 00:30:50,710
 Mom and Dad are both blood type AB, 

283
00:30:50,710 --> 00:30:54,040
 Jeong Ha Eun's blood type is AB. 

284
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:06,250
I wanted to cut my hair.

285
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:08,540
I'm closed now.

286
00:31:14,570 --> 00:31:19,450
Okay. I'll cut your hair for you. Come over here.

287
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:34,380
You have an eye disease?

288
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:38,870
But why do you look familiar? Where have I seen you before?

289
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:43,820
You're good looking.

290
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:47,030
Why do you look so somber?

291
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:52,840
How should I cut it for you?

292
00:31:58,060 --> 00:32:00,560
What's your blood type?

293
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:02,940
Why are you asking that all of a sudden?

294
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:05,690
Because you seem like you have a good personality.

295
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:08,120
I'm always curious about the blood types of those kinds of women.

296
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:11,600
I'm AB.

297
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,260
What about you?

298
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:18,900
But why was Seong Woo blood type O?

299
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:20,710
Did you really just pick him up from somewhere?

300
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:24,480
Seong Woo? Seong Woo's blood type B.

301
00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:33,450
Ha Eun! Jeong Ha Eun!

302
00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:38,280
Taxi. Taxi!

303
00:32:48,790 --> 00:32:51,490
Are you a patient? Would you like to sit?

304
00:32:51,490 --> 00:32:53,770
I'm fine.

305
00:32:53,770 --> 00:32:56,350
Could you please stop the bus?

306
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:59,950
Sir, stop the bus, please!

307
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:14,130
Let's leave!

308
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:26,600
What am I going to do? There are no phones here.

309
00:33:41,970 --> 00:33:44,860
You're so weak. How dare you?

310
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:51,260
You or that thing... all you know is how to whine—

311
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:52,200
That thing?

312
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:56,180
Yeah. The kid that you used to play with.

313
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:57,960
That thing.

314
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:00,880
Why did you kill him?

315
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:03,090
You're crazy.

316
00:34:03,090 --> 00:34:04,350
Why did you kill him!

317
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:07,810
I'm killing myself trying to feed myself and my kid,

318
00:34:07,810 --> 00:34:12,200
but why should I feed and clothe his ex-wife's kid!

319
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:17,480
For me, let's just say we don't share blood,

320
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:22,340
but he didn't even recognize his own son.

321
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:25,070
I told him that his blood type was O.

322
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:29,820
My husband completely believed that his first wife had gotten pregnant from a different man!

323
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:36,690
He took off all his clothes, tied him up, and beat him for hours,

324
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:41,600
but I couldn't look at him with my eyes open.

325
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:47,580
You deceived him?

326
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:53,640
If that thing is gone, we would be happy so what could I do! I had to kill him!

327
00:34:54,770 --> 00:35:00,240
That little kid was so tough. I'd starve him and he wouldn't die.

328
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:04,000
Even if I left him outside all night, he didn't die.

329
00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:09,440
That day I pushed him once

330
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:15,150
and that thing... he just slept.

331
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:18,050
If I had killed you earlier,

332
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:22,560
Seong Woo wouldn't have died.

333
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:28,300
That thing would have died anyway.

334
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:30,780
Stop calling him that thing!

335
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:35,240
 Seong Woo, I'm here. 

336
00:35:56,970 --> 00:35:59,600
   

337
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:24,410
Yes, this is Love Salon and someone is hurt.

338
00:36:24,410 --> 00:36:28,720
Hospital. She needs to be taken to St. Peter's hospital.

339
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:31,380
Hurry up! I think this woman is going to die.

340
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:33,510
Please hurry up and come here. Please.

341
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:35,590
I... I—

00:37:24,250 --> 00:37:25,420
 How did he look like?

 He has a scar above his left eye.

 Gong Ji Cheol was frightened. 

352
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:37,140
 I want to prove that what that girl believes isn't wrong. 

353
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:39,780
 That bastard's after Ha Eun. 

354
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:43,280
 All you can do is promise to marry a girl who may die at any moment. 

355
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,970
 In that situation,  you want to protect her, don't you? 

356
00:37:44,970 --> 00:37:47,200
 So you mean your goal in staying alive is to kill Ha Eun?
