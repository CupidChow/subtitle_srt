1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:04,190
   
  I'm the detective who called you before.  

2
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:07,760
Prosecutor, Im Hwa Yeong was a regular here.

3
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:12,340
The owner here says she remembers Im Hwa Yeong vividly on the day of the murder.

4
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:14,900
Do you remember the person who accompanied her that day?

5
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:19,110
She said such strange things that day, so I remember.

6
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:21,780
Even the face of the man who came with her.

7
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:24,350
But she was crying.

8
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:28,960
- At first, I figured the guy upset her. 
 - She was crying?

9
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:38,860
-   Aunt!  Another soju, please
-  Yes!  

10
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:43,680
 Here you go. 

11
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,750
 So... 

12
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:55,760
 because the kid cried so much... 

13
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,710
 I took him to the hospital. 

14
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:03,670
 Biliary... what was it again? 

15
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:07,740
 He would cry all day. 

16
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,890
 He was like an object, not a person. 

17
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:17,550
 An object that kept crying annoyingly. 

18
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:25,420
 I felt like I could live if it wasn't for the child. 

19
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:31,660
  Biliary atresia? 

20
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:35,340
 I don't know. Was that it? 

21
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:39,910
 Oh, I don't remember. 

22
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:44,920
 Let's just keep drinking. Cheers! 

23
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:54,600
  Is that why you killed your child? 

24
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:57,310
  How did you kill your child? 

25
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:12,510
  Still, when I sent him off, 

26
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:16,870
 I put him in good clothes. 

27
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:19,610
 In expensive silk. 

28
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:24,610
 So that in his next life, 

29
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,700
 he won't get a wench like me 

30
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:31,070
 as his mom. 

31
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:40,350
Maybe it was a made-up story to seduce the guy, but she spewed so much nonsense!

32
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:42,890
Did they leave together? What time did they leave?

33
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:47,250
Not sure... Maybe around midnight?

34
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,930
Oh, right!

35
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:52,550
She couldn't walk, and he took her outside.

36
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:57,010
So I thought they were going to a motel, but he put her in a cab and sent her away.

37
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,490
 Prosecutor, we've received the contents of Im Hwa Yeong's cell phone. 

38
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:04,650
 I checked all the recent numbers that were used frequently. 

39
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:08,320
There was one person whose number was registered to an errand app.

40
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:11,620
 The number is 010 8960. 

41
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,430
 I called the company that owns the app. 

42
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:17,330
- Who is it? 
  - Take a look. 

43
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:24,640
 Ms. Namgoong Joo Hye asked for this to be delivered. 

44
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:29,100
- Oh, thank you. 
 - The fee is â‚©50,000  (about $41) .

45
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:52,520
Back at the autopsy room...

46
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:08,270
This flower's meaning is eternal love.

47
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:11,290
I bought it thinking it complimented this exhibition.

48
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:29,090
Jeong Sa Bin?

49
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:40,050
Track the part-timer's phone.

50
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:42,570
 I'll make an inquiry to the carrier. 

51
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:46,270
 It's not KR or L-Sha. 

52
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:48,430
 The carrier is SKP. 

53
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:52,470
 It was registered in May of 2005. Name is Cheon Jong Beom. 

54
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:55,550
 Date of birth is February 14, 1998. 

55
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:57,740
Cheon Jong Beom?

56
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:00,680
Is there any other suspect besides Cheon Jon Beom?

57
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:05,140
 The security is so lax at Im Hwa Yeong's apartment building. 

58
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:09,290
 We're obtaining info to see if there are any other suspects, 

59
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:12,070
 but Cheon Jong Beom is the primary suspect at this time. 

60
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:16,280
Please investigate in detail Cheon Jong Beom's whereabouts the day before the murder.

61
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:51,260
When you first see the remains, I stare at it for a while as well.

62
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:56,070
Until I'm able to see the face of the person while they were alive.

63
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,910
So can you see it?

64
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:13,430
See what?

65
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:17,000
You said you can see their faces while they were alive.

66
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,230
- When you see their remains. 
 - Of course, I can see it.

67
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:28,960
My friend is a genius graphic designer who restores people just from their remains.

68
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:33,850
When the faces come alive on dry bones, it makes my heart race.

69
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:37,060
Even if they're restored,

70
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:41,000
what meaning does seeing a dead person's face have?

71
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,820
You're meeting someone from another lifetime.

72
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:49,900
Even though we lived in different times,

73
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:55,450
if we look face-to-face, we can communicate.

74
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:53,140
What does it say?

75
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:57,020
It's the ardent love letter from a wife to her husband who's leaving this world.

76
00:08:57,020 --> 00:09:00,300
Seeing it was written in Hangul, she must have been a commoner.

77
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:04,160
Name is... "Yeon's mom."

78
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,700
A straw shoe with Yeon's mom's hair intertwined was also found by the grave.

79
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:09,520
What does it say there?

80
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,750
Are you curious?

81
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,510
- "My Dear,"  ("My dear," sounds like the name)  
- Lee Bo So?

82
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:20,590
It's a term of endearment. The couple from the Yi Dynasty.

83
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,600
"My Dear..."

84
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:30,140
"My Dear, will others love so affectionately as we do?

85
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:35,450
Didn't we promise to die together after our hair turned white?

86
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:38,480
You have already left for the other world,

87
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:42,750
but could your heart be as sad as mine?

88
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:47,090
Please read this letter carefully, and come to my dream

89
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:49,410
so that I can see you clearly.

90
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:53,800
My Dear, in my dream,

91
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,780
I believe that I will see you.

92
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:15,100
Please come to me in secret and show yourself in my dreams.

93
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:19,350
There is no end...

94
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:21,720
to what I want to say to you."

95
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:45,490
Whenever I hear the words of the remains, I have a habit of tearing up.

96
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:06,590
I'll finish up. You have to get home, too.

97
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:10,460
Right, I should.

98
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:18,130
Cheong Jong Beom!

99
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,540
Where were you on March 9 and 10 between 10:00 p.m.and 2:00 a.m.?

100
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:30,020
Where you were from 10:00 to 2:00,

101
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:32,360
give me an alibi who can vouch for you for every minute during that time.

102
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:35,060
I know you're a prosecutor,

103
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:37,920
but you should introduce yourself before asking me questions.

104
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:48,790
I'm investigating the murder at Pureum Studio Apartments.

105
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:52,330
Im Hwa Yeong. You know her well, don't you?

106
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:57,130
Im Hwa Yeong's murder?

107
00:11:57,910 --> 00:12:01,900
How they all have the same reaction...

108
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:06,290
There's a witness who saw you going to her apartment that day.

109
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:09,390
We parted around midnight and went home.

110
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:11,640
Part-timers drink with their customers, too?

111
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:15,100
My errand that day was to drink with her.

112
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:22,090
You don't look like you need money so badly that you need to do that kind of errand.

113
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:27,520
Should I tell you your real objective?

114
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,560
You're smirking?

115
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:32,750
Someone has died, and you smirk?

116
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:40,320
Hey!

117
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:46,430
You're... Cheon Eun Woo, aren't you?

118
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:52,500
You do a lot of things using your identity as a prosecutor.

119
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:56,970
I'm sure you're busy, but you even ran a background check on me?

120
00:12:56,970 --> 00:13:01,160
You should learn to answer a question with a yes or a no first.

121
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:03,860
I'm not one for studying.

122
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:07,460
What does it feel like to spend three days with a dead person?

123
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:22,810
You're scary when you glare.

124
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:25,280
I'm asking out of personal curiosity.

125
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,990
Try experiencing it firsthand.

126
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:30,960
You're a prosecutor, after all.

127
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:34,120
There are lots of corpses in the autopsy room.

128
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,520
I'm going to.

129
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:47,110
Not sure I'll get the same feelings as you did, though.

130
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:08,330
 It's me, Byeon Seong Hoon. Can you meet with me tomorrow morning? 

131
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:11,880
Damn it...

132
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:16,000
   

133
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:29,060
Sorry, Prosecutor. I couldn't sleep well last night.

134
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:30,520
Oh, is that right?

135
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:33,760
From now on, please speak with my lawyer.

136
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:38,490
He's a famous human rights lawyer.

137
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:43,040
I guess you didn't know.

138
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:51,900
Currently, there's only one body presumed to have been

139
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,720
the result of my client's murder.

140
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:56,420
And it was accidental only.

141
00:14:56,420 --> 00:15:00,110
He was seen on a security camera buying murder weapons, and yet it was accidental?

142
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:05,640
My client bought that in order to repair his house.

143
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:10,700
Anyway, I heard that you wrote the scenario where my client

144
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:15,790
murdered seven people, and that you were also responsible for fabricating

145
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:18,770
the recently unearthed 30-year-old remains, right?

146
00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:23,130
According to my client,

147
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:25,980
the remains that were buried with a book of some sort,

148
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:29,800
I heard you pinned the blame on my client.

149
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:33,220
This is the "tyranny of public power."

150
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:35,840
Do you have proof?

151
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:39,580
Bring the corpse here, huh?

152
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:42,520
If I have committed murder,

153
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:45,810
there should be a corpse!

154
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:48,240
A corpse!

155
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,240
Do you understand?

156
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,800
Seriously, are you deaf?

157
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:06,570
It's a personal curiosity,

158
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:09,760
but the cat tattoo on your arm, who did you want to see it?

159
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,310
Huh?

160
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:17,510
- Cat? 
 - Of the women you killed, none are shorter than you, right?

161
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:20,290
But then again, most women would be taller than you.

162
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:22,090
You jerk...

163
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:26,250
When I look at you, I see someone who's been beaten up by a woman before.

164
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:28,730
There was a punk like that when I was in school.

165
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:33,250
He was big as a mountain, but he would cry after getting beaten up by a woman.

166
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:37,110
He used to get his belongings taken away by women, too.

167
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:42,450
But that guy used to beat up his younger sister and his dog a lot.

168
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,930
Oh!

169
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:48,530
Is that why you started to kill?

170
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:50,160
Because you were bullied by women?

171
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,360
You jerk!

172
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:08,530
Find out who's backing Byeon Seong Hoon!

173
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:14,490
I'll scare him for you one of these days.

174
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:20,110
He's the type to take it even further, Kim Soo Hyeok.

175
00:17:20,110 --> 00:17:23,150
If he keeps this up, he'll be the only one getting hurt.

176
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:26,790
Really? How will you do that?

177
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:30,290
Will you cut him? Break him?

178
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:32,930
Will you chop him up?

179
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:37,920
Did you really kill seven people?

180
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:42,920
My mom told me to be the best no matter whatever I chose to do.

181
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:47,270
I'm going to beat Gong Ji Cheol.

182
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,330
Crazy bastard.

183
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:06,580
I can't see a single letter.

184
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:09,480
Not even one...

185
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:15,620
Seriously...

186
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:31,930
It's a way of digitally restoring various texts

187
00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:37,860
that have faded away or evaporated.

188
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:41,660
If it's from 30 years ago,

189
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:44,840
maybe not print, but we should be able to at least get some remnants of ink.

190
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:46,640
   

191
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:50,840
Oh! What's this?

192
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:54,690
I'm not sure. It looks like some kind of a stamp.

193
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,760
I think we'll be able to identify the remains from Dongang.

194
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,440
We found something conclusive.

195
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,890
Conclusive evidence?

196
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:06,950
If you come with me, you'll see.

197
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:09,040
Where are you right now?

198
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,710
- Get in. 
 - Okay.

199
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:32,890
Put your seatbelt on.

200
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:50,790
It's a bookstore stamp from the book buried with the Dongang remains.

201
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:54,470
A bookstore called "Old Future Book Store," there are just three in Seoul

202
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:56,950
in Sillim-dong, Anam-dong, and Cheonggye-cheon.

203
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:04,650
Aren't you going to give up?

204
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:07,770
Fine. Is the Dongang mummy alive?

205
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:09,980
He died 30 years ago!

206
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:12,970
Do you want to get a living person hurt because of a dead person?

207
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:15,830
I'm talking about a living murderer, Byeon Seong Hoon.

208
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:19,860
That bastard... if he crawls back out into the world, he'll kill someone else.

209
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:21,820
I'm not interested in anything else.

210
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:25,790
My interest lies only in the remains I'm trying to identify.

211
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:36,460
So you think you'll be able to find the real culprit by identifying the old remains?

212
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:39,500
Why? Do you want to hear an apology from them?

213
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:44,250
Look. Have you ever lost a loved one?

214
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,040
I only want to keep my promise to the remains.

215
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:53,460
I'm going to make sure I deliver the ring that he clutched until the moment he died.

216
00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:58,460
Fine. Let's each use our own methods then.

217
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:00,460
That's the remains of someone Byeon Seong Hoon has killed.

218
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:05,790
Any unidentified remains that appear in the future, Byeon Seong Hoon has killed in my book.

219
00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:10,960
I'm sorry, but please stop the car. I'll get out.

220
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,880
Look!

221
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:53,760
Come to your senses, Prosecutor Lee.

222
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:57,950
You can't die. Wake up.

223
00:22:57,950 --> 00:23:00,310
Wake up!

224
00:23:04,610 --> 00:23:07,570
   

225
00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:10,160
A person is hurt, please come quickly.

226
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:12,940
I'm at...

227
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:15,350
Where is this?

228
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:20,070
A person is dying.

229
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:24,090
He's bleeding... He's bleeding so much.

230
00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:26,950
Blood. Blood...

231
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:45,800
 At that moment, I could see his blood. 

232
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:53,620
 "If all else perished and you remained, I should still continue to be. 

233
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:59,900
 Whatever our souls are made of, yours and mine are the same." 

234
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:02,750
 Page 73. 

235
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:05,950
 You keep buying the book you've already read. 

236
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:08,870
 Because I'm going to propose with that verse. 

237
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:10,520
 For her to be my bride. 

238
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:16,420
â™«   You whose name I do not know but whom I cannot forget   â™«

239
00:24:17,570 --> 00:24:20,430
â™«   One I've never seen and whose name I do not know   â™«

240
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:23,930
 So this is what he looks like. 

241
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:26,990
 Nose, lips... 

242
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:31,560
  This man doesn't know I fell in love with him at first sight. 

243
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:40,900
â™«   I think thoroughly tonight   â™«

244
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:46,830
â™«   You were that familiar image I may have seen somewhere   â™«

245
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:55,280
â™«   The image of love I had forgotten   â™«

246
00:24:56,170 --> 00:24:59,880
â™«   My lover, I'd seen some years ago   â™«

247
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:05,460
 "My Dear, will others love so affectionately as we do? 

248
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:11,060
 Didn't we promise to die together after our hair turned white? 

249
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:17,470
 You have already left for the other world, but could your heart be as sad as mine? 

250
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:22,260
 Please read this letter carefully, and come to my dream, so that I can see you clearly. 

251
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:24,600
â™«   So I am unable to open my eyes as I watch you   â™«

252
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:30,220
 My Dear, in my dream, I believe that I will see you. 

253
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:33,040
 Please come to me in secret and show yourself in my dreams. 

254
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:37,370
 There is no end to what I want to say to you." 

255
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:41,190
â™«   Please come tonight, my dearest   â™«

256
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:48,640
â™«   My dearest who disappears when I open my eyes   â™«

257
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:56,450
â™«   I am unable to open my eyes as I watch you again   â™«

258
00:25:56,450 --> 00:26:04,030
â™«   My dream is broken like a bubble   â™«

259
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:12,420
â™«   Come to my dream tonight, my dearest   â™«

261
00:26:19,330 --> 00:26:21,330
    

262
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:23,300
 Kim Soo Hyeok instead of the woman? 

263
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:26,620
 Most people get injured or die. 

264
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:29,100
 This child will never be abandoned. 

265
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:34,140
 It's a place where a genius artist whom I took care of used to live. 

266
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:38,320
 He's young, but he's one scary bastard. 

267
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:41,920
 Kim Soo Hyeok nearly died, while trying to save me. 

268
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:44,960
 I guess he was a precious person to you. 

269
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:48,970
 He said he could recognize Gong Ji Cheol's eyes. 

270
00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:50,900
 That bastard will come. 

271
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,560
 Gong Ji Cheol is dead. 
    

272
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:58,000
 Do you know a murder's blood flows through your veins?
