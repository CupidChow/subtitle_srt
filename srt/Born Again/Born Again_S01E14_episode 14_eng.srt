1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:03,580
   

2
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:15,820
I thought you were done with psychopaths. What are all those for?

3
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:17,980
Cain!  What was his gene?

4
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:21,280
Psychopath's gene: MAOA.

5
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:24,460
One out of 1,000 people is born with the MAOA gene.

6
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:27,670
Cain, do you have a psychopath's gene?

7
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:30,100
Who are you talking to?

8
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:32,250
Right!  Let's say he has a psychopath's gene.

9
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:35,380
Let's say that gene manifested when he was 15 years old.

10
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:39,230
Let's say that he was a juvenile delinquent.

11
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:41,350
His brother fed him detergent.

12
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:45,820
Then what's next? What would be next?

13
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:54,230
You're not normal.

14
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,030
 You're not normal. 

15
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:07,240
  What's wrong? You don't even go to church, but yet you're obsessed with Cain and Abel. 

16
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:09,580
      

17
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:20,660
I got my hanbok yesterday. You know there's a law society fundraiser tomorrow, don't you?

18
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:24,930
It seems like you're thinking about not attending, but if you don't—

19
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:28,400
I'll go, Mom. I'll be there.

20
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:35,100
Yes, okay.

21
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:39,450
I'll wear that outfit. See you tomorrow, Mom.

22
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:43,030
   

23
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:31,480
Jong Beom.

24
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:38,330
Why is the door open?

25
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:50,530
 The person you called is unavailable, so... 

26
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:52,860
He's not picking up.

27
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:27,140
   

28
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:31,790
 Mom says to make sure you attend the fundraiser on the weekend. 

29
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:44,300
  Why did God abandon Cain and choose Abel?  

30
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:57,180
  In the end, Cain became the first murderer ever.  

31
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:27,690
   

32
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:33,990
Please go to Sapyeong.

33
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:36,020
Sapyeong? Yes.

34
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:48,300
 The phone has been turned off. 

35
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:28,850
You want to make your wealthy husband an assemblyman?

36
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:35,050
Assaulting employees, battery, video of bribing with sex, there are plenty of charges that could be brought to light.

37
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:37,300
Will that work?

38
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:40,510
Is Jong Beom doing well?

39
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:46,450
That's why I'm thinking about keeping my son-in-law right by my husband.

40
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:48,670
Son-in-law?

41
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:52,400
Prosecutor Kim Soo Hyeok must have not told you yet.

42
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,810
I love how discreet he is.

43
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,300
  Oh, Author Jang! 

44
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,240
  Hello.  

45
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,800
 - Can I have your autograph?   
  - Yes.  

46
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,210
Were you going to send me your wedding invitation?

47
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:44,960
I was waiting for the right time to tell you.

48
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,700
I'm sorry, Chief Prosecutor.

49
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:51,030
You don't feel like you've dug your own grave?

50
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:55,760
Why would you want to clean up after that kind of household?

51
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:59,530
I know how to draw the line between public and private matters.

52
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,380
     

53
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:20,760
 Eat up. 

54
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:39,750
Okay.

55
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:45,970
I'm sure you didn't come here to give support. Are there remains here, too?

56
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:51,770
Prosecutor Kim Soo Hyeok... Can I go inside for a minute?

57
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:53,300
Is something going on?

58
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:57,110
Oh, it's just that... I need to confirm something.

59
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:59,820
You seem to have a lot of things you need to confirm.

60
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,560
 What happened? 

61
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,580
 What? 

62
00:09:58,190 --> 00:09:59,750
Cheon Jong Beom.

63
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:07,480
You really came just because you were told?

64
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,700
You're alone even here.

65
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:12,190
You never fit in.

66
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:20,750
You're just going to be alone forever, so why don't you fall in and die here?

67
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:27,390
Why? You don't want to die?

68
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:29,830
Then try killing me.

69
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:33,120
Should I?

70
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:52,290
Help me! Help me!

71
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:54,140
Help me!

72
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:57,980
  Help me! Help me!  

73
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,440
  - Help me!   
   - No!  

74
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,810
  Help me!  

75
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:10,590
  Help me!  

76
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:50,030
Jeong Sa Bin, wake up. Jeong Sa Bin!

77
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:07,690
Jeong Sa Bin, wake up.

78
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:09,540
Jeong Sa Bin!

79
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:19,860
  Death. It's strange.  

80
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:22,170
  It's not unfamiliar.  

81
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:26,430
  Hyeong Bin.  

82
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:28,340
  Ha Eun.  

83
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:38,450
  Why can't I die?  

84
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:45,500
♫   When did you go and not come back. 
You who left a single leaf and went away   ♫

85
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,380
  I miss him.  

86
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:50,450
  I miss him so much.  

87
00:13:50,500 --> 00:14:00,300
♫   Soaking tears left on top of the branch. 
The rising sound of the wind is left behind   ♫

88
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:06,800
♫   On top of the bare branch   ♫

89
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,780
  It's beating.  

90
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:12,500
  When I look at this man, my heart...  

91
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:15,490
  keeps on...  

92
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:25,300
♫   Even the moonlight is covered by clouds,
 it only adds to the loneliness   ♫

93
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:31,550
♫   Exhausted by bird sounds all night,   ♫

94
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:37,660
♫   Will the single leaf fall   ♫

95
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:43,950
♫   Even if you stayed far away, it would still bloom   ♫

96
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:47,300
♫   The flower cluster that couldn't bloom is sure to bloom   ♫

97
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:49,230
Are you sure you're okay?

98
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:50,860
Are you okay?

99
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:53,230
 Oh, that was close. 

100
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:03,580
  Jong Woo!  

101
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:05,210
  Move aside.  

102
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:07,580
  What happened to him?  

103
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:08,430
  What happened?  

104
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:10,170
  Jong Woo.  

105
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:11,510
  Jong Woo.  

106
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:13,800
  - Are you okay? Oh, no.   
   - I called an ambulence.  

107
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:18,690
Are you okay? Are you sure you're okay?

108
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:22,340
That kid... Did that kid survive?

109
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:27,990
He did. And you nearly died.

110
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:30,740
Why on earth are you so reckless?

111
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:50,390
 He fell in the water. 

112
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:53,720
 How can this happen? 

113
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:58,090
 That was so dangerous. 

114
00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:01,110
 It was so close. 

115
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:02,940
  Hurry up! 

116
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:35,830
  Jeong Sa Bin, wake up.  

117
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:37,940
  Jeong Sa Bin! 

118
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:44,450
Are you awake now?

119
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:47,880
Wait just a moment, I'll call the doctor for you.

120
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:03,640
Thankfully, other than an abrasion from a piece of wood, there are no other signs of injury.

121
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:07,650
But a problem could arise because of water left in the lungs,

122
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:11,250
so it would be best to keep him under observation here for one more day.

123
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:15,240
Let's do that then. Oh, I contacted Professor Cha on my way here.

124
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,870
- You heard, right? 
 - Yes.

125
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:20,220
We will be handling the process from our end.

126
00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:26,670
Your brother saved you.

127
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:29,480
Aren't you going to thank him?

128
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:34,800
Brother, you know that I can't swim.

129
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:37,640
Why did you lure me there?

130
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:42,360
That bridge... you knew it was broken, didn't you?

131
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,040
Brother.

132
00:17:53,850 --> 00:17:56,110
  Murderer!  

133
00:18:07,810 --> 00:18:09,280
Lower your voice, this is a hospital.

134
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:12,850
Is that important right now, Mom? I said he tried to kill me!

135
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:13,980
I told you to be quiet.

136
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:16,110
Is it true?

137
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:22,160
Are you even trying to kill my son now?

138
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,920
It should be enough that I covered up the Im Hwa Yeong incident for you.

139
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:31,950
Have you even once thought that it might not be true?

140
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:35,550
What?

141
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:40,450
Did you ever think that I might not be the one who killed Im Hwa Yeong?

142
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:46,230
Then catch the real culprit and bring him to me.

143
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:51,890
I will speak with him. He's my son.

144
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:55,420
I have nothing to say.

145
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:15,410
- Did you try to kill Jong Woo? 
 - Yes.

146
00:19:15,410 --> 00:19:19,890
I'll ask again. Did you try to kill my son?

147
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:22,870
You said it doesn't matter if I murder.

148
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:37,040
I said it's okay even if you've committed murder.

149
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:40,130
I didn't say you could mess with what belongs to me.

150
00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:43,810
Mom.

151
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:46,220
Go ahead.

152
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:48,550
Jong Woo suffers from many minor ailments.

153
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:55,310
If I suffered from as many minor ailments as he has, what would you have done with me?

154
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:56,800
What?

155
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:59,710
If I had been as ordinary as Jong Woo,

156
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:05,260
you probably would've abandoned me.

157
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,970
      
      

158
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:43,490
     

159
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:45,290
  I saw you, too.  

160
00:20:45,290 --> 00:20:46,880
  I know...  

161
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,150
  your signature.  

162
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:00,490
 Someone told me to give this to you. 

163
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:17,160
     

164
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,260
There's something I need to know. 
   

165
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:29,210
Let's talk next time.

166
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:35,330
No. Let's talk now.

167
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:41,110
Even if you want to kill your brother, not just anyone can do it.

168
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:44,500
Are you telling me to prove that you and I are different?

169
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:45,620
What?

170
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:48,260
Then I have something I need to know, too.

171
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:53,560
Why... did you save Jong Woo?

172
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,900
Because I couldn't let it happen.

173
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:55,710
You can't?

174
00:21:55,710 --> 00:22:00,400
I can't let you become a murderer.

175
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:13,630
I'm already a murderer.

176
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:15,880
I told you I don't care about your past.

177
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,550
Past?

178
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:21,990
I'm a murderer now and in the future, too.

179
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:24,470
I may have failed today...

180
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,700
But I will eventually kill Jong Woo.

181
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:41,400
♫    When I look at you, the whole world seems
 to have stopped while filled with you   ♫

182
00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:42,670
♫   Even if someday   ♫

183
00:22:42,670 --> 00:22:48,280
You didn't kill him. I'm glad you didn't.

184
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:53,600
Had I been a little late, the person who would have stood here tonight

185
00:22:53,600 --> 00:23:01,070
would have been unimaginably different than the one who's here right now.

186
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:03,130
Because I wasn't late,

187
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:07,510
and because I didn't let you feel regret,

188
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:09,160
I'm happy.

189
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:16,160
♫   My dear, even if we don't say anything, 
even if I'm just looking at you   ♫

190
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:20,750
You can win. Fight the monster within you.

191
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:24,230
I'll help you win.

192
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:02,010
Did you hear it today? The performance was the worst.

193
00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:03,730
You were told to fix your bad habit of the way you hold the strings.

194
00:24:03,730 --> 00:24:07,240
Do you want to marry a woman who has a bad habit like that?

195
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:10,780
You just have to correct it. Besides that, it's bearable.

196
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:12,540
Let's go.

197
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:17,180
What's up with you?

198
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:19,830
Why did you save that woman?

199
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:22,440
There were two people that fell in the water.

200
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:25,960
Why that woman? And for the second time, too.

201
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:29,320
I saved the person that needed to be saved faster. That woman has heart disease.

202
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:33,380
Do you know how you looked at her?

203
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:36,450
You've never looked at me that way. No,

204
00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:41,290
I have never seen you look at any woman that way.

205
00:24:41,290 --> 00:24:45,070
You're still as childishly illogical as ever.

206
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:49,430
Marrying you is also a promise I made to myself.

207
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:53,600
I have never broken a promise that I made to myself.

208
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:59,920
Whether hot or cold, they're my logical feelings.

209
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,220
Do you remember?

210
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:06,090
Soo Hyeok, we met for the first time at Philip Jang's concert.

211
00:25:06,090 --> 00:25:09,650
Why did you agree to a date with me?

212
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:10,930
Because I was pretty?

213
00:25:10,930 --> 00:25:13,740
That was a long time ago. Let's go.

214
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:17,010
Tell me. What was the reason?

215
00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:20,390
- I liked what you said. 
 - What did I say?

216
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,170
 Philip Jang. 

217
00:25:22,170 --> 00:25:23,850
 Isn't he really sexy? 

218
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:27,420
 That performer's heart and mine are connected. 

219
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:32,320
 Philip Jang's real name is Jang Gi Pyo. Since he was 18, he's been heavily into drugs and committed rape. 

220
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,440
 Then he went overseas to study and changed his identity. 

221
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:38,590
 An artist always has an inner demon. 

222
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:42,530
  I want to sleep with that man's soul, not his body.  

223
00:25:42,530 --> 00:25:45,460
  Tonight. Right now.  

224
00:25:47,370 --> 00:25:51,710
 I don't want to embrace your body but your soul.  

225
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:56,510
  It was then, when I heard you say you wanted to sleep with his soul and not his body.  

226
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:59,360
  I wanted to meet with you once again.  

227
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:03,430
  A woman who says those words... what kind of woman is she?  

228
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:31,790
  That's right. I'm confessing.  

229
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:34,290
  I realized when you got hurt earlier.  

230
00:26:34,290 --> 00:26:38,370
  That I didn't need any experiments.  

231
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:14,090
 I see now... 

232
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,760
 I like you. 

233
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:35,730
 Because I like you, you mustn't ever get hurt. 

234
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:40,030
 I realized when you got hurt earlier. 

235
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:44,540
 That I didn't need any experiments. 

236
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:31,150
      
   

237
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:43,230


238
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:49,590
♫   Exhausted by bird sounds all night,   ♫

239
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:55,790
♫   Will the single leaf fall   ♫

240
00:28:55,790 --> 00:28:59,720
♫   Even if you stayed far away it would still bloom   ♫

241
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,290
     

242
00:29:01,290 --> 00:29:04,690
 Why are you eliminating Gong Ji Cheol as a suspect? 

243
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:06,390
 He was recorded on the security camera! 

244
00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:09,920
  Is the last page fiction, or is it fact?  

245
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:12,810
 I've been told there's someone who wants to kill my daughter. 

246
00:29:12,810 --> 00:29:16,260
  Are you by any chance looking for my dad? Why?  

247
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:19,990
 Remember two sets of eyes. Those that are coming to kill you 

248
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:22,060
 and those that are coming to save you. 

249
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:25,650
 If you die, I can live on longing for this moment. 

250
00:29:25,650 --> 00:29:28,930
  I only love those who I choose.
