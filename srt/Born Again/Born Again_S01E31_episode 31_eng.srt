1
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:04,180
 At that time, I already 

2
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:06,640
 sensed my fate. 

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,860
 In my insignificant and worthless life, 

4
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:12,390
 the one who became a ray of light, 

5
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:14,320
 Jeong Ha Eun. 

6
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:17,410
 For her, whatever I can do, 

7
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:21,260
 I will do. Even death. 

8
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:24,900
   

9
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:29,910
   

10
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:32,070
   

11
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:38,250
- What's this? 
 - I realized that I'm not qualified to be a prosecutor.

12
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:42,830
Also, I would like to fix all the mistakes I've made due to my beliefs.

13
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:46,800
And for not following your orders, I will take responsibility as well.

14
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,260
After splattering all the sewage water on me,

15
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:51,560
you want to take responsibility?

16
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,570
Let me ask since we're on the topic.

17
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:57,540
Why were you so desperate to put Gong In Woo and Baek Sang Ah behind bars?

18
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:03,210
You must already know how many people they both killed.

19
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:07,350
Also, Baek Sang Ah tried to kill someone I love.

20
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:09,300
And about Gong In Woo.

21
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:13,960
Think of him as the atonement of a detective who had a part in framing Gong Ji Cheol as a serial murderer.

22
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,740
Which detective?

23
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:18,230
Never mind.

24
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:23,380
Hearing the word atonement from your mouth, I guess it really is time for you to resign.

25
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:30,690
I'll assign you to a position in the provinces, so stay quiet.

26
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:33,270
Don't make things messier.

27
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:36,830
Let me ask you something, too.

28
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:41,120
Why did you try to cover up the Gong In Woo case

29
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:44,620
even by trying to kill me?

30
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:46,220
You...

31
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:48,440
What are you talking about? Kill whom?

32
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:53,950
Is it because you were in charge of that case,

33
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:57,130
or is it because there are more secrets that need to be kept?

34
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:05,140
The resignation,

35
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:07,260
I'll take that as you've accepted it.

36
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,570
This is my last request as your colleague.

37
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:37,860
Please make sure you look at the retrial petitions I sent over.

38
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,860
I know best.

39
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:47,630
Since I was in charge of those cases.

40
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:10,000
 So don't confess anything on the first night. 

41
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,440
 You won't be forgiven just because you confess. 

42
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:15,000
 Isn't confessing a sin courage? 

43
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,520
 To someone who's hurt, burdening them with the obligation to forgive just makes it harder. 

44
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,490
 I wouldn't confess if it was me. 

45
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:25,230
 Then you're telling me to live with that sin? 

46
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:28,720
 No. You can protect them. 

47
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:34,930
 While protecting the person beside you, you can just put your life on the line once. 

48
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:44,180
Can we meet right now?

49
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:46,700
I have something I need to say.

50
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:49,110
I can't today.

51
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:51,680
I'm with my dad right now.

52
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:55,400
Okay. I'll call you tomorrow.

53
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,460
Why did you bring so much?

54
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:05,230
Try some. Isn't it good?

55
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:07,800
Yeah, it is.

56
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:11,220
This is the sushi rice you love so much.

57
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:13,900
Please chew it well.

58
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:20,050
It's good. It's really. Flounder is good in the spring.

59
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:22,710
Our uncles are the best.

60
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:25,460
Sa Bin, you try some, too.

61
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:28,940
We're taking good care of her, so don't worry.

62
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:32,000
Just eat your fill, Big Bro.

63
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,520
Dad, try the strawberries I brought. You like strawberries.

64
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:43,740
It's good. I have a present for you, too.

65
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:49,080
- You have it. 
 - It's your diary.

66
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:52,850
I won't write diaries anymore. I'm not scared of Gong Ji Cheol anymore.

67
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:55,780
He's not a serial murderer.

68
00:04:55,780 --> 00:05:00,320
Right. He's not a serial murderer. He was falsely accused.

69
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,490
So now I don't need it anymore.

70
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:06,350
Then, can I read it?

71
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:12,530
I come to you with the spring flounder!

72
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:14,720
Big Bro, drink some water, too.

73
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,910
That's good.

74
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:28,610
 There's something you need to see. I'll be right over, so wait there. 

75
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:36,380
What do I need to see?

76
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:39,240
It's this. My dad's diary.

77
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:41,520
Look at this.

78
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:47,460
It says here...

79
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:49,740
The person who killed you.

80
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:53,250
 Gong Ji Cheol was killed by the prosecutor in charge. 

81
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:57,060
 The person who Gong Ji Cheol contacted after coming back to life in the morgue... 

82
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:59,120
 was Attorney Jang Hye Mi. 

83
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:04,490
 But she only pretended to help Gong Ji Cheol, 

84
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:07,070
 while making another deal behind his back. 

85
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:08,670
 There's someone you need to take care of. 

86
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:12,190
 Why is she asking me what I'm going to do with a punk that's already dead? 

87
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:23,470
 Cheon Seok Tae... he killed Gong Ji Cheol. 

88
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:28,560
Cheon Seok Tae must have ordered you killed.

89
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:35,420
Jang Hye Mi told me that the person who killed me

90
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:37,730
was Cheon Seok Tae.

91
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:42,600
I couldn't trust Jang Hye Mi, so I wasn't sure.

92
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:46,760
But the only lawyer who I trusted stabbed me in the back,

93
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:49,910
and in order to cover up her past,

94
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,990
she aided the prosecutor in a murder.

95
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:01,960
You know now that revenge isn't done by shedding blood

96
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:04,410
but by making the person carry the weight of their sin

97
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:07,580
and atone for it while alive.

98
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:13,350
My father in my prior life destroyed my mind,

99
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:16,540
and the father I met in the present

100
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:20,470
killed me physically.

101
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,350
 Gong Ji Cheol... 

102
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:40,610
  could be watching you from nearby. 

103
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:42,970
 Even though the body has disappeared, 

104
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:45,940
 the wronged soul returns. 

105
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:48,790
Come in.

106
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:55,600
What brings you here?

107
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:59,820
- I have a question to ask. 
 - What is it that you are coming at this hour?

108
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:02,960
I met a man by chance recently,

109
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:07,930
and he trembled when he saw me, saying that Gong Ji Cheol had come back to life.

110
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:11,970
- What? 
 - Since you've met him in person,

111
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:14,500
you must know well.

112
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:17,150
Do you think that

113
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:20,340
I look that similar to Gong Ji Cheol, too?

114
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,940
What are you doing?

115
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,800
What did he say?

116
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:32,020
He said that Prosecutor Cheon Seok Tae told him

117
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:35,230
if he didn't keep his mouth shut,

118
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:37,920
he'd hurt him and his daughter.

119
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:43,330
Who are you?

120
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:45,880
Did you kill me?

121
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:03,160
Tell me. Did you kill someone because you didn't want to admit your mistake?

122
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:06,510
And by destroying even the remains,

123
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:09,030
climb to your present position?

124
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:12,180
Gong... Gong Ji Cheol.

125
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:14,650
Are you really Gong Ji Cheol?

126
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,420
That's right.

127
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:20,550
Gong Ji Cheol whom you killed.

128
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:26,640
Get out. Get out! Get out of here right now!

129
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:31,010
What's the matter?

130
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:33,980
- What's going on? 
 - You...

131
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:35,950
what did you do?

132
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:39,850
Where the hell did you get this devil's spawn?

133
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:41,920
Devil's spawn?

134
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:45,060
His DNA is from among the country's top 1% best and brightest!

135
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:47,750
The DNA I received,

136
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:50,960
- belongs to someone you don't even know. 
 - What do you mean?

137
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:54,930
Jang Hye Mi... She told me.

138
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:57,580
She switched the expensive sperm that you bought

139
00:09:57,580 --> 00:10:00,890
with sperm that was donated without any identification.

140
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:05,350
- What? 
 - Get out.

141
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:08,150
Stop talking nonsense

142
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:10,620
and get out of my sight immediately.

143
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:12,980
Get out! Both of you!

144
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,370
Cheon Seok Tae,

145
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:24,480
I know you'll never change.

146
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,930
So I'm going to just watch you.

147
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:31,170
Since you'll have to remember I'm alive for the rest of your life.

148
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:34,710
And all the atrocious things you've done in order to succeed,

149
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:38,100
making sure you never forget until the day you die

150
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:41,320
is my revenge.

151
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:58,960
You still have a chance.

152
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,930
Hurry up and run away.

153
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:05,180
Don't blame your parents later for ruining your life.

154
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:07,140
Okay...

155
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:58,520
Someone who has never received love...

156
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,190
   

157
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:02,690
A person who was raised with a father's curse

158
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:07,100
that he would become a murderer.

159
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:15,030
I feel so sorry for you.

160
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:20,140
Rest in peace now.

161
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:24,210
Gong Ji Cheol.

162
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:48,800
   

163
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,010
I want to see you.

164
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:14,630
Me too.

165
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:16,680
I want to see you, too.

166
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:20,120
- Can I come see you? 
 - Of course.

167
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:29,880
Jong Beom.

168
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:33,870
Oh, right!

169
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:36,350
I have something urgent to take care of. I forgot.

170
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:38,820
 I'll call you later. 

171
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:41,820
Okay. I'll be waiting.

172
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,540
Did you...

173
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:19,790
make my life a joke?

174
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:22,440
What?

175
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:25,740
Did you cause someone to be born as my child

176
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:28,650
who looked like Gong Ji Cheol?

177
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:35,660
What are you saying? Do you think I'm a god?

178
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:41,030
I just switched the sperm your wife selected with anonymous sperm.

179
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:44,540
Who knew he would be born as Gong Ji Cheol?

180
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:51,990
So... why on earth did you do that to me?

181
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,820
You're asking because you really don't know?

182
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:00,980
Now that you've accelerated your success,

183
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:03,930
you can't remember anything of the past?

184
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:08,170
You said you would love only me until the day you died,

185
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:13,080
begging me never to stab you in the back.

186
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,190
Have you forgotten all about that?

187
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:19,230
You said you'd be happy just sharing some noodles together.

188
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,440
And what did you do?

189
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:25,500
You got introduced to a woman from a reputable family

190
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:28,070
and never even answered my calls.

191
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:30,110
After doing that,

192
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:33,220
you ask me what I've done?

193
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:35,020
Back then,

194
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:38,950
instead of Gong Ji Cheol,

195
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:42,570
I should have killed you.

196
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:46,740
Hanging on pathetically until the end

197
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,500
is really nauseating.

198
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,200
I'm the one who regrets everything.

199
00:15:56,890 --> 00:16:00,620
If I hadn't told you where Gong Ji Cheol was,

200
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:05,250
you would still be floundering at the bottom right now.

201
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:08,310
Why did you tell me?

202
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:10,910
Are you going to tell me again that it was because of love?

203
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:15,090
That's right. I loved you.

204
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:21,160
I did it because I didn't want the man I loved to be ruined.

205
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,090
So...

206
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:31,180
that's why as soon as you broke up with me, you slept with that disgusting Gong In Woo?

207
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:34,740
Filthy...

208
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:51,620
You...

209
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:55,940
really want to die, don't you?

210
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:02,180
Hey, put that down.

211
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:04,760
Watch your manners.

212
00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:19,410
Prosecutor Kim Soo Hyeok, to what do I owe this honor?

213
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:22,290
You want to arrest me because I hit you more?

214
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:26,370
How much is the rent for a place like this? I guess you wouldn't know.

215
00:17:26,370 --> 00:17:29,830
- Since Chairman Baek or whoever pays for it. 
 - Prosecutor Kim Soo Hyeok,

216
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:32,850
do you still have business left with me?

217
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:40,390
Starting today, I'm not a prosecutor. I'm here to repay my debt to you.

218
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:44,030
What kind of ridiculous crap is this about?

219
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:49,920
Seo Seong Ha. Let's request a new trial.

220
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:54,830
Even after the defendant's death, you can still appeal.

221
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:58,930
I know better than anyone that his sentencing was wrong.

222
00:17:58,930 --> 00:18:03,390
Give me a chance to correct his unjust death.

223
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:09,590
Are you being sincere?

224
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,320
I'll start by apologizing.

225
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:20,730
I'm sorry... to your little brother,

226
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:22,530
and to you.

227
00:18:23,810 --> 00:18:25,920
This bastard... is he jerking me around?

228
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:30,030
I was in charge of the case, so I can't defend.

229
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:35,800
I'll get you a capable lawyer and submit all the files needed.

230
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,980
You get your guys and gather materials

231
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:43,520
to prove that Seo Seong Ha loved that teacher.

232
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:03,560
If the retrial request is accepted, then...

233
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,350
This punk...

234
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:16,510
The bullet's position has changed.

235
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:20,820
At the last examination, the bullet was lodged in the left temporal region,

236
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:25,160
but now it's touching a blood vessel and the brain stem.

237
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:27,150
So you're saying...

238
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:30,190
it's gotten much worse, right?

239
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:33,620
Yes. At this rate,

240
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:37,270
it's only a matter of time before the bullet enters the blood vessel.

241
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:39,770
I can't even guarantee one month.

242
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:43,510
Then I'll have the operation right away.

243
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:46,520
You said I could survive if I have surgery.

244
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:49,630
Let's do it right now.

245
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:52,830
The situation now is different than before.

246
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:56,180
The chances of a successful surgery are not even 10 percent.

247
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:58,040
Doctor,

248
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,530
I have to live.

249
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:05,600
I...

250
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:08,280
have a reason to live now.

251
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:12,760
So why did you push back the surgery until so late?

252
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:25,080
I want to live, please... Please save me.

253
00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:30,800
Right now... I can't recommend surgery.

254
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:42,660
The Donggang mummy remains that were discovered on March 5, 2020,

255
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:45,670
according to the racial classification test

256
00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:49,480
and hematological analysis for paternal and maternal lines,

257
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:52,470
the person who died in 1988 and

258
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:58,930
was born in 1956 has been confirmed to be Cha Hyeon Bin.

259
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:03,070
Rest in peace.

260
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:11,780
- Detective Cha! 
 - But your presence

261
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:14,880
enabled us to identify him quickly. What should we do with the remains?

262
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:19,300
He just... told me to take care of it all.

263
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:22,610
- Is there a living relative? 
 - Detective Cha...

264
00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:28,020
No, Detective Cha's distant relative told me to do that.

265
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:32,820
Okay then. Then let's close the Donggang mummy case as of now.

266
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:36,830
Mr. Lee Bo So found his name thanks to you.

267
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:38,790
Good work.

268
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:51,230
Can I... take it in your place?

269
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:52,790
Pardon?

270
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:03,610
    
 If you find Hyeong Bin's body, 

271
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:06,970
 please bury him here with me. 

272
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:18,590
Yes, In Do... I'm here waiting now.

273
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:21,510
What?

274
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:38,060
"Whether you're alive or dead, I will find you,

275
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:44,760
and you also must find me."

276
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:49,000
That's what I prayed for 30 years ago.

277
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,390
The reason I was reborn must have been

278
00:22:53,390 --> 00:22:56,590
to find you again like this.

279
00:22:56,590 --> 00:23:00,960
♫   and whose name I do not know   ♫

280
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:05,700
♫   My lover who grazes by my past dream   ♫

281
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:09,530
Thank you for finding me again, Ha Eun.

282
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:12,240
Thank you for letting me find you,

283
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:15,450
Hyeong Bin.

284
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:16,340
     

285
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:22,120
♫   You were that familiar image I may have seen somewhere   ♫

286
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:30,340
♫   The image of love I had forgotten   ♫

287
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:37,790
♫   My lover I'd seen some years ago   ♫

288
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:45,050
♫   Dearest, whom I've met some autumns ago   ♫

289
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:53,660
♫   I'm afraid if I open my eyes I will awake from this dream   ♫

290
00:23:53,660 --> 00:24:01,200
♫   So I am unable to open my eyes as I watch you   ♫

291
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:08,850
♫   My dream that is broken like a bubble   ♫

292
00:24:08,850 --> 00:24:10,340
♫   Please come tonight  ♫

293
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:16,500
In the end... the two of them were buried together.

294
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:20,100
Jeong Ha Eun... lucky you, your wish came true.

295
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:22,930
♫   My dearest who disappears when I open my eyes   ♫

296
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:28,410
With this, the 30-year-old story of Jeong Ha Eun and Cha Hyeong Bin

297
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:30,790
has ended.

298
00:24:30,790 --> 00:24:39,100
Now... should we talk about the us of this lifetime?

299
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:45,790
♫   Come to my dream tonight, my dearest   ♫

300
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:49,390
Soo Hyeok, should we...

301
00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:51,320
Wait.

302
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:58,220
Cha Hyeong Bin's story hasn't ended yet.

303
00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:03,300
I feel like I may have come back into your life

304
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:05,910
because I wasn't able to tell you this.

305
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:10,670
You mean, what you wanted to tell me before?

306
00:25:10,670 --> 00:25:12,340
Yes.

307
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:19,440
It's something I should have told you when I first came to see you.

308
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,390
Even if it's hard, will you hear me out?

309
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:35,510
 Kim Jin Hyeok, you bastard, I'll catch you today no matter what. 

310
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:24,290
I knew at least that the person who caused the accident was a wanted criminal being chased by the police.

311
00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:29,600
But... you're saying... that person was you?

312
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:33,960
Yes... It was me.

313
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:41,270
You were only chasing the suspect.

314
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:45,790
You didn't cause my parents' death, he did.

315
00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:47,540
Right?

316
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:50,030
Isn't that so, Hyeong Bin?

317
00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:53,420
If I hadn't cornered him like that,

318
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:56,520
that accident

319
00:26:59,530 --> 00:27:02,150
might not have happened.

320
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,800
I'm sorry.

321
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:23,530
I'm sorry, Ha Eun.

322
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:34,530
I fell in love from the first moment I saw you... I was afraid I wouldn't get a chance even to begin that love.

323
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:42,670
That's why back then, and until now,

324
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:47,140
I couldn't tell you.

325
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:52,120
I'm sorry... I'm really sorry, Ha Eun.

326
00:28:02,330 --> 00:28:06,030
I... I'm...

327
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:09,960
so... confused right now.

328
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,080
Sorry.

329
00:28:48,550 --> 00:28:53,150
Why are you coming now? I thought I would die from missing you.

330
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:18,080
Jeong Sa Bin!

331
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,100
How long are you going to keep this up?

332
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:21,610
What's going on?

333
00:29:21,610 --> 00:29:23,450
Shouldn't we just break the door open and go in?

334
00:29:23,450 --> 00:29:26,080
She said she just wants to be alone to think.

335
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:30,280
A day or two is one thing, but she hasn't eaten or gone to work for a few days now.

336
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:33,000
This won't do. Get Jan Beom.

337
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,270
- Jan Beom? 
- Jan Beom.

338
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:36,340
- Who's Jan Beom? 
 - You mean Jong Beom?

339
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:40,380
He calls him that because he feels bad for him whenever he sees him.

340
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:07,300
    
  Jong Beom, Sa Bin hasn't come out of her room for three days. Can you come over?  

341
00:30:35,610 --> 00:30:36,570
What's going on?

342
00:30:36,570 --> 00:30:41,670
I don't know, but Sa Bin is holed up in her room and won't come out.

343
00:30:41,670 --> 00:30:44,080
Can you call her out?

344
00:30:54,090 --> 00:30:56,560
Senior, is something wrong?

345
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:05,350
You've been like this after crying like that the other day?

346
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:08,360
You told me once.

347
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:15,060
"You can be sad, angry, and feel pain."

348
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:20,740
I didn't know it then, but now I do.

349
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:24,170
Since you taught me how to sympathize.

350
00:31:24,170 --> 00:31:30,130
If I was like this, you'd do everything in your power to drag me out.

351
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:34,360
We're all worried about you, Senior.

352
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:36,600
Please come on out.

353
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:39,950
Senior.

354
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:54,030
♫   Meeting you   ♫

355
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:56,100
♫   I don't want it to become a sad destiny   ♫

356
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:58,080
Sa Bin.

357
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,560
What's wrong? Why are you crying?

358
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:02,750
What in the world happened?

359
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:08,500
I was going to come out when the tears stopped... but they won't stop.

360
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:13,080
I was going to come out smiling when I felt less pain.

361
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:16,920
But it's not getting better.

362
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:23,760
It... It hurts so much I could die.

363
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:30,330
♫   Pain rushes into the heart   ♫

364
00:32:31,930 --> 00:32:32,740
♫   Even if I'm left alone again   ♫

365
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:34,050
Sa Bin!

366
00:32:34,050 --> 00:32:37,330
Sa Bin! No!

367
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:43,160
 There's always a scent of the earth on your back. 

368
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:47,690
 The scent of the earth after it's rained for awhile 

369
00:32:47,690 --> 00:32:53,300
 and the sun has just come out. I know this scent. 

370
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:54,650
 But do you know something? 

371
00:32:54,650 --> 00:32:58,630
 Another man was with Patient Jeong Ha Eun the whole time. 

372
00:32:58,630 --> 00:33:00,500
 But it's not the first time. 

373
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:03,930
 Last time, too, he carried Patient Jeong Ha Eun here. 

374
00:33:03,930 --> 00:33:05,860
 I remember now. 

375
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:11,030
 Your back... the back that always saves me. 

376
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:15,030
  It was you... Gong Ji Cheol.
