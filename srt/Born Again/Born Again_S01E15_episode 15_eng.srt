1
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,540
   

2
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:30,130
   

3
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:45,820
    

4
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:48,460
   

5
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:54,570
   

6
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:01,450
   

7
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:11,260
 Timing and Subtitles by the Reborn Team @ viki 

8
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:20,130
Sit.

9
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,580
Good job.

10
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:03,980
Go inside.

11
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:51,370
Manson is a fierce dog. How did you manage to train him so well?

12
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:55,480
Dogs have a sixth sense, so they know who they need to attack.

13
00:02:55,480 --> 00:03:00,230
Once they feel the wave of energy, they use their sense of smell.

14
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:04,010
Then a fierce dog chooses its owner.

15
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:06,540
You like mugwort blue blood tea, right?

16
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:12,500
   

17
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:16,570
Revenge... The returning Heathcliff

18
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:18,950
destroys everything

19
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:21,920
and leads everyone to destruction.

20
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:27,700
Destruction is also one of the ways to possess love.

21
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:36,490
While watching the woman he loved dying because of him, I wonder what Heathcliff felt.

22
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:41,580
I wonder. He might have cried.

23
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:46,360
I wonder what it feels like to kill the one you love.

24
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:52,720
Perhaps. I don't know.

25
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,880
Do you think it would be sad?

26
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,420
If it were you, how do you think you'd feel?

27
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:08,830
If it was me,

28
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:14,910
perhaps I would kill the person who set the trap.

29
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:25,690
Could the person who fell in the trap really discover the trap that ensnared him?

30
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:29,040
You could set a trap of your own.

31
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,890
Something more painful.

32
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:36,320
What if the prey doesn't show up where you've set the trap and lie in wait?

33
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:40,750
You'd lure it there.

34
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:45,250
By frantically triggering the prey's instinct.

35
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:55,850
That prey... I'm curious as to what choice it'll make.

36
00:04:55,850 --> 00:05:00,910
Whether it will go where the hunter lures it like a beast,

37
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:06,690
or whether it will be able to reject its own instinct like a human being.

38
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:13,560
I guess these types of things are interesting to you.

39
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:17,310
I like writing about prey.

40
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:22,020
A human being is like a beast at his most human moment.

41
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:49,220
 Help me! 

42
00:05:55,820 --> 00:06:00,670
Until the incident occurred, there was definitely a sign to keep out.

43
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:04,870
But only on the day when Cheon Jong Woo fell in, there was no sign.

44
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:10,050
The distance from the villa where the party took place to this lake is about 300 meters.

45
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:12,890
And the lake connects to a trail.

46
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:13,880
What about security cameras?

47
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:17,990
There are no security cameras around the lake or the villa.

48
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:22,520
There's a security camera near an eatery by the trail

49
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:25,580
and also at a restaurant that looks like a cabin. Oh!

50
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:28,270
There's one at a convenience store, too.

51
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:32,760
But the incident happened here, so why are you asking about security cameras all the way out by the trail?

52
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:36,570
I'm sure it was planned. Punks like that usually plan these things out.

53
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:41,940
A week before the incident, three days before, a day before, and then a few hours before on the day of the incident.

54
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:45,240
He would have done a preliminary survey and devised a scenario.

55
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:48,310
Check the security cameras near the trail, and the analysis lab...

56
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:51,690
No. Give them to my assistant.

57
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:57,000
It's just a handful of rural area security camera recordings. I'll check them all myself.

58
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:02,650
But even if it was attempted murder,

59
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:06,630
the incident wasn't reported, and it's Chief Prosecutor Cheon's family matter.

60
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:12,970
If Chief Prosecutor Cheon found out you were sticking your nose in it, would he just stand by and watch?

61
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:16,290
Detective Joo, are you Chief Prosecutor Cheon's man?

62
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:18,060
Pardon?

63
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:23,780
Actually, you're the one who's Chief Prosecutor Cheon's...

64
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:32,740
Well, I don't answer to any one person.

65
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:38,600
Chief Prosecutor Cheon and I have known each other for 30 years, so...

66
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:43,170
He's sulking. He is.

67
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:46,760
Are you sulking? Huh?

68
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,490
 I saw that kid for the first time when he was 13 years old. 

69
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:58,750
 He had a lot of interest in Gong Ji Cheol, 

70
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:01,760
 so I gave him a book as a present. 

71
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:08,450
 Mother-in-Law, could we meet today for a moment? 

72
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:11,110
 You're busy, so I'll come to you. Where are you? 

73
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:13,260
I'm near the summer home in Sangpyeong.

74
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:33,620
   

75
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:37,620
Yes, Mom.

76
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:40,700
I'll be right there.

77
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:05,460
Driver Lee, you said you can't swim. Right?

78
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:08,830
Ever since you fell in the river when you were young, you said you were scared of the water.

79
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:10,880
Yes.

80
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,390
Right. Then come stand over here.

81
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:15,280
In front of me.

82
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:51,640
I apologize. I stumbled.

83
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,900
Right. You may leave.

84
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:04,280
It must have been so fun for you to see Jong Woo flailing in the water.

85
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:07,960
Was this it? The reason for calling me here?

86
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:10,030
How could it be?

87
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:15,590
Even at moments like this, your voice is unfalteringly gentle.

88
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:20,260
You were born with a voice with the ability to strike the core of people's hearts.

89
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:25,220
This must also be your taste.

90
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:28,410
Can you try and smile more brightly?

91
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:35,010
I called you here to make you aware that I will never abandon you.

92
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:37,690
You're no ordinary Top 1%.

93
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:43,120
You're breathtakingly perfect in every way.

94
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:46,660
Mom,

95
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:52,400
at times like these, moms usually tell their kids they won't abandon them.

96
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:55,560
I'm disappointed if you wanted an ordinary mom.

97
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:02,130
Go first. I'll be right behind you.

98
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:06,830
You've never come when I waited.

99
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:11,610
Didn't someone else come to get me instead of you?

100
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:14,240
That someone else is also me, in the end.

101
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,380
Since I sent that person to you myself.

102
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,940
This time, you go first. I'll be right behind you.

103
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,300
 It's been so long since I've been to an amusement park. This time it's Edge World. 

104
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:54,640
 Jeong Sa Bin is mad that I'm going without her. 

105
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:14,230
A blue passenger car...

106
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:16,320
Who are you looking for?

107
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,650
Why are you investigating so stupidly?

108
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:20,950
I'm busy.

109
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:23,040
You have a part-timer in front of the store.

110
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,410
Let me watch for a little while longer.

111
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:29,310
Stop. Stop, stop.

112
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:31,710
Rewind it a little bit?

113
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:33,120
There.

114
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,860
RM bike...

115
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:42,190
Yes, Prosecutor. I got someone.

116
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:44,980
A security camera caught Cheon Jong Beom's bike.

117
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:48,780
Yes. RM bike logo is

118
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:51,880
on the frame and the wheel. Yes.

119
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,760
The license plate number is

120
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:57,920
SSD-6047. Oh!

121
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:04,690
 Cheon Jong Beom's bike that was captured on the security camera just drove past in front of me! 

122
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:05,900
Are you sure it's Cheon Jong Beom?

123
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:08,480
He's wearing a helmet, so I can't see his face,

124
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:12,360
but I'm sure it's his bike from having trailed him before.

125
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:15,370
The video captured at the convenience store

126
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:18,820
 was at 2:30 p.m. on the day of the incident. 

127
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:22,380
But there was a female student riding on the back of the bike.

128
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:23,970
- A female student? 
  - Yes. 

129
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:29,780
And her uniform is from Sanjeong High School nearby.

130
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:32,630
I'll go and check it out.

131
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:56,270
I want to talk about Cheon Jong Beom today.

132
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:59,140
By the way, is that person okay?

133
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:02,850
The one who you saved at the lake?

134
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:07,630
I was surprised. I didn't know you had the hero gene.

135
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:11,130
You're someone who thinks rationally.

136
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:15,270
How could you jump in to save another woman in front of your fiancée?

137
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:18,730
If you're bothered because of Sang Ah—

138
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:21,140
It's just my own personal curiosity.

139
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:26,010
A man who doesn't even bat an eye when a man he framed hangs himself in prison,

140
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:30,880
how could he be so selfless at that moment?

141
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,020
Framed?

142
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:34,710
Oh, I heard it somewhere.

143
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:39,630
That someone had his eye on you because his younger brother died unfairly.

144
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:44,000
Who is that person?

145
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,260
I thought you knew.

146
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:48,770
Seo Tae Ha, was it?

147
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:51,420
His brother is Seo Seong Ha.

148
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:57,050
Seo Tae Ha... younger brother Seo Seong Ha.

149
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:04,590
Seo Seong Ha wasn't framed. He was a pedophile who hung around day care centers whenever he got out of prison.

150
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:06,770
Still, a prosecutor has no right

151
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:10,570
to put false charges on a pedophile and make him stand trial.

152
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:17,190
I'm sorry, but the reason I came was what Cheong Jong Beom was copying from Gong Ji Cheol.

153
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:21,360
Both know of your specialty.

154
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:31,410
So the reason you're not indicting the real culprit in Im Hwa Yeong's case is because of Cheon Jong Beom.

155
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:35,520
Cheon Jong Beom knew the murderer's secret

156
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:39,000
and committed the yellow umbrella copycat crime.

157
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,490
But why is Gong Ji Cheol excluded from the list of suspects?

158
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:44,590
Gong Ji Cheol?

159
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:48,600
My book is fiction.

160
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:53,420
Like a picture puzzle, the fact is hiding within the fiction.

161
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:58,360
Could the last page be fact or fiction?

162
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:02,300
You keep beating around the bush. I'll get going now.

163
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:05,410
I have no time to play games with you.

164
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:08,840
Wait.

165
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:19,090
   

166
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:27,820
 There's a prison guard who saw Gong Ji Cheol walk out of prison alive after being executed. 

167
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:36,950
Prosecutor, I confirmed with the prison where Gong Ji Cheol was executed.

168
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:41,910
May 31st, 1988, there were three prison guards who took part in his execution.

169
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:44,050
Goo Won Jin, Hwang Jeong Ui, Jeong Seong Eun.

170
00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:47,600
Goo Won Jin and Hwang Jeong Ui have already passed away.

171
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,310
And Jeong Seong Eun is still alive.

172
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:52,590
Where is Jeong Seong Eun's residence?

173
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:58,960
 Gyeonggi, Yongin-si Sangheung-gu, Seolin-dong 36-2 

174
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:01,860
 Dasarang Nursing Hospital, Jeong Seong Eun. 

175
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:03,600
   

176
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,130
Please take my dad out for two walks today.

177
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:09,260
It can't be too long. Just 30 minutes each.

178
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:10,680
He likes flowers.

179
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:15,670
I went to a tulip festival when I was young at a children's park.

180
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:20,740
Oh, please don't let anyone other than me or my uncles see him.

181
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:23,150
What's my dad doing right now?

182
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:25,990
 He keeps writing things down these days. 

183
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:30,420
 I think he's writing things down he remembers for when he recovers. 

184
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:36,220
Please tell him I love him.

185
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:50,110
 I'll pretend I didn't hear that confession. 

186
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:52,860
 I have someone I'm going to marry. 

187
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:02,950
 The wedding invitation will be out soon. If you want, I'll send you one. 

188
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,830
I'm crazy.

189
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:30,300
   

190
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,440
What?

191
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:49,080
You're a regular here?

192
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,140
What are you reading?

193
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,320
It's nice out. You're not staying in here all day, are you?

194
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:59,520
No. I like it here.

195
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:03,630
I have something I need to mentally master before the day's over.

196
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:09,100
You're not buying this, are you?

197
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:13,800
Hey. What are you doing?

198
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:18,190
You need to come with me somewhere. Let's go.

199
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:21,800
I don't want to go. What's wrong with you?

200
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:29,040
♫  Your eyes that look at me  ♫

201
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:34,810
♫  Look sad without reason  ♫

202
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:42,850
♫  When I look at you, the whole world  ♫

203
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:48,920
♫  Seems to have stopped by being filled with you  ♫

204
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:52,570
♫  Someday, even if we have a hard time  ♫

205
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:53,740
I'll go get some drinks.

206
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:57,710
I'll have a pineapple Coolpis.

207
00:19:57,710 --> 00:20:02,610
♫  I'm not going to leave  ♫

208
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:09,250
♫   Even if the warm wind carries me away   ♫

209
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:12,730
♫   You are my one and only love   ♫

210
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:17,250
♫   Don't let go of my hand   ♫

211
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:22,510
♫   My dear, even if we don't say anything   ♫

212
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:26,070
♫   Even if I'm just looking at you   ♫

213
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:31,340
♫   You're the one I want to see   ♫

214
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:40,760
This game arcade is where you wanted to bring me?

215
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:43,080
I wanted to get on a roller coaster with you, to be exact.

216
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:46,220
How can we do that here?

217
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,710
But this isn't scary, is it?

218
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:11,900
To be honest, I've never been on a ride before.

219
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:13,890
If you're scared, hold onto me.

220
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:18,580
We're going.

221
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:24,620
It feels real.

222
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:37,940
Oh, it's scary.

223
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:58,300
It feels like my body's falling while my heart's in its place.

224
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:00,570
But let's go on it one more time.

225
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:03,770
It's great. The best!

226
00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:06,280
Great. Best?

227
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,250
You're not picking up! 
    

228
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:24,910
I got a call that my son was injured, so I think I have to step out for a bit.

229
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:21,570
   

230
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:48,130
Which room is patient Jeong Seong Eun?

231
00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:52,610
His daughter requested that no one other than his family members be allowed to visit him.

232
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:54,660
I’m an acquaintance of his daughter.

233
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:57,420
What’s the daughter’s name?

234
00:23:57,420 --> 00:23:59,660
- Her name is— 
 - Miss!

235
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:01,570
Patient Jeong Seong Eun has disappeared.

236
00:24:01,570 --> 00:24:04,230
I definitely saw him seated during the concert.

237
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:05,880
I told you to keep a close eye on him!

238
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:08,910
I told you he leaves his room whenever he gets a chance!

239
00:24:08,910 --> 00:24:11,150
Where’s his caregiver?

240
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:12,690
Where did he go?

241
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:14,430
Miss Jeong, look for him.

242
00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:17,430
And Miss Lee, call his guardian right away! Hurry!

243
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:23,120
Hello? This is Dasarang Nursing Hospital.

244
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,090
You’re Jeong Seong Eun’s guardian, right?

245
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:30,030
Yes, Miss Jeong Sa Bin. Your father’s missing.

246
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:34,340
Yes, I think you’ll have to come to the hospital.

247
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:42,860
I'll be right over.

248
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:45,030
I think I need to leave first.

249
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:46,430
- What's going on? 
 - It's about my dad.

250
00:24:46,430 --> 00:24:48,660
Sorry. I'll call you.

251
00:25:24,910 --> 00:25:28,340
 Just wait for a little, kitty. I'll be there to save you soon. 

252
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:30,060
 Right, good. 

253
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:34,980
 No, you can't move. 

254
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:37,540
 You're going to fall. Hold still. 

255
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:40,460
 Just a sec, kitty. 

256
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,260
 You didn't let go, did you? Don't ever let go. 

257
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:50,080
 That scared me. 

258
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,360
I won't...

259
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:15,750
let go of your hand. Ever.

260
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:23,570
   

261
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:33,660
   

262
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:42,240
What do we do? It's all my fault.

263
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,850
While I went out for a little while.

264
00:26:43,850 --> 00:26:45,740
What about the closed prison? Did you check?

265
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:47,700
Dad always went there whenever he disappeared.

266
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:50,850
I already checked that place, but he wasn't there.

267
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:52,410
I'll go check again.

268
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:55,750
Sa Bin, even your acquaintance went looking for him, too,

269
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:57,830
so he'll be found soon.

270
00:26:57,830 --> 00:27:01,160
I mean, is it your boyfriend?

271
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:03,630
Boyfriend?

272
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:34,560
 If you tell anyone I'm alive, you're dead. 

273
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,680
That guy is coming.

274
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,670
Run away. Run.

275
00:28:36,670 --> 00:28:39,850
Please run away. Please run away.

276
00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:41,210
Run away. Run away.

277
00:28:41,210 --> 00:28:43,360
Mr. Jeong Seong Eun.

278
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,130
Jeong Sa Bin.

279
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:15,930
   

280
00:29:15,930 --> 00:29:17,900
Dad!

281
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:33,390
How is my dad...

282
00:29:33,390 --> 00:29:35,570
Let's get him back to the hospital first.
