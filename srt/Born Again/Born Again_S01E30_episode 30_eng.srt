1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:04,130
     

2
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:06,820
Prosecutor, you have a visitor.

3
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:14,250
Why did you come here?

4
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:19,240
You asked for time, but I can't wait any longer.

5
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:24,390
If you don't make the move properly, I'll do it my way.

6
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:28,060
And what is your way?

7
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:31,290
I'm thinking about making a deal with Jang Hye Mi with the evidence in Baek Sang Ah's case.

8
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:37,160
She'll give me anything I want if it's to save her daughter.

9
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:51,210
This was discovered very recently at Park In Sook's house when she suddenly passed away.

10
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:58,700
There should be more. Photos taken with other victims.

11
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:00,670
We're already looking for them.

12
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:03,910
Once we find them, even though Gong In Woo's statute of limitations has expired,

13
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:07,930
at least we should be able to clear your name.

14
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:10,830
Detective Cha! I just came from Park In—

15
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:14,170
It's okay, tell me.

16
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,860
I just came from Park In Sook's house.

17
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:24,600
We searched the trash, too, but it turned up empty.

18
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,610
There's nothing that could be used as evidence.

19
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:29,510
You didn't find anything special in the films?

20
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:33,120
I was told that's just a single-use camera that was popular back then.

21
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:36,360
There's no way Gong In Woo would have left them in Park In Sook's care.

22
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:41,970
I'm sure she found this one by chance and kept it. To get revenge one day.

23
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:46,080
How about we leak it to the media?

24
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:51,590
Someplace that likes gossip, that keeps creating more gossip.

25
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:54,130
That's a great idea!

26
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:56,910
There's a TV program I can set you up with.

27
00:01:56,910 --> 00:02:00,170
The directing producer there is my nephew.

28
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,790
Now, on Inside Cases tonight,

29
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:09,090
we have Reporter Go's exclusive Hot Issue.

30
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:13,600
He always causes a chill by bringing us shocking cases. Reporter Go Seong Min,

31
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,330
what have you brought us tonight?

32
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:18,870
Today, I got a hold of the best photo possible.

33
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:23,000
Please excuse us for blurring out the photo since it's too shocking.

34
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,010
Let's take a look first.

35
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:32,870
If you take a good look, there's someone smiling next to the body of a dead woman.

36
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:37,390
This man is the suspect who was arrested recently for attempted murder at a nursing hospital, Gong In Woo.

37
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:42,190
There's been renewed suspicion that he could be the real culprit in the Yellow Umbrella serial murder case from 30 years ago.

38
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:46,180
This photo is evidence of that.

39
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:49,380
Detective Cha, do you think this will be effective?

40
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:51,360
Butterfly effect.

41
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,380
We're hoping that a small wave will cause a typhoon.

42
00:02:54,380 --> 00:03:00,270
 But wasn't that case closed as the acts of Gong Ji Cheol  who was called the serial murderer of the century? 

43
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:01,270
 Did you see this? 

44
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:03,980
 He was already executed 32 years ago. 

45
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:06,500
 If Gong In Woo is the real culprit, 

46
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:09,960
then Mr. Gong Ji Cheol was wrongfully executed.

47
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,310
 What's more surprising is that— 

48
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:14,790
 Hey, it's no joke about Gong In Woo. Have you seen it? 

49
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:17,600
 Wow, crazy... What is that? 

50
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,870
 He's not crazy, he's a psycho. 

51
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:24,950
How was this possible?

52
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:29,690
It's because the departments of police, prosecution, and justice were that corrupt back then.

53
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:33,400
The problem is that the prosecutor in charge of that case 32 years ago

54
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:38,960
is the candidate for Director of the Public Prosecutors' Office, Prosecutor Cheon Seok Tae.

55
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:41,100
As we know, the hearing is coming up in a few days.

56
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:46,120
Candidate Cheon's morals and ethics need to be closely examined.

57
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:50,680
 Right now, the Blue House is not in a position to keep supporting you. 

58
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:54,480
 We suggest you voluntarily resign. 

59
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:09,640
 If it's revealed that Gong In Woo is the real culprit in the Yellow Umbrella serial murders, 

60
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:12,810
 we can't charge him for his crimes since the statute of limitations has expired. Right? 

61
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:14,520
Who cares about the statue of limitations?!

62
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:18,970
He killed all those people! We should put him on trial

63
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:20,500
and throw him behind bars for good!

64
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:25,850
Right, right. I completely agree with your wise opinion, my comrade.

65
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:27,150
That's right.

66
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:28,310
Uncles,

67
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:30,260
please be quiet!

68
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:33,260
 The truth has no statute of limitations. 

69
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:36,960
 But it's vital to clear Mr. Gong Ji Cheol's name 

70
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,420
 and take steps to restore his reputation. 

71
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:44,380
 Witness, did you see the defendant kill Yoon Jeong Hee? 

72
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:46,250
 Yes. 

73
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:50,450
 That isn't all. What's even more shocking is that 

74
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:55,770
Ms. Baek who is currently on trial for the copycat murders of the Yellow Umbrella case, do you remember him?

75
00:04:55,770 --> 00:05:00,960
Yes. It caused an uproar since she is the daughter of Ms. J, who wrote  "The Murderer's Secret."

76
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,120
That's right.

77
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:06,050
I have received a tip from a reliable source that Ms. Baek is the daughter of Gong In Woo.

78
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:09,450
Are you saying Ms. J is Gong In Woo's secret mistress?

79
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:10,420
That's right.

80
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:17,330
So there's a high chance that the book,  "The Murderer's Secret," isn't fiction but factual.

81
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:21,970
  If you switch the name Gong Ji Cheol in the book with Gong In Woo, 

82
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:26,490
 the puzzle pieces of the murder can now all be fitted together. 

83
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:08,450
 You'll never give up until you kill Ha Eun. 

84
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:09,470
 No! 

85
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:11,550
 Do you have an alibi for every hour? 

86
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:15,710
 Whether it's personal or private, I don't think she has any reason to talk to a murder suspect like you. 

87
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:17,380
 I'm not done with you yet. 

88
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:20,900
 And you're still a suspect. My motive for murder is my principle. 

89
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:26,120
 My principle is that I have to get rid of those who hurt my people. 

90
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:42,610
Why did you call for me?

91
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:48,020
You saw the broadcast, didn't you? Everyone was excitedly talking about it.

92
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:52,950
Thanks to me, the media outlets must have made a lot of money.

93
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:58,500
Are you okay?

94
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:04,190
Why? Oh, right. Because that photo was revealed?

95
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:10,280
Tell them to do whatever they want. What can they do with just one photo?

96
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:14,820
Don't worry and just take good care of the rest of the photos.

97
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:17,630
Don't create unnecessary issues.

98
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:19,750
Aren't you worried about Sang Ah?

99
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:22,380
What about her?

100
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:31,220
Your daughter is being pegged as a copycat criminal who followed in the steps of her father's murders.

101
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:34,590
It's the worst situation with the second hearing coming up.

102
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:40,860
That's your expertise. Like you protected me, protect her, too.

103
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:44,590
That's why you became a lawyer, isn't it?

104
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:53,110
Even if it doesn't go well, don't be distraught.

105
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:56,470
Sang Ah is my work of art.

106
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:59,390
She's a masterpiece.

107
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:07,450
Like my paintings, even after time passes, she'll remain as a work of art.

108
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,910
Gong In Woo...

109
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:19,330
I thought you were some kind of a god.

110
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:27,350
When you killed my sexually abusive stepfather for me saying that you'd  save me by shedding blood,

111
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:33,860
I really felt saved. I felt like I was reborn.

112
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:40,330
That's right. I think I saw a halo of some kind over you back then.

113
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:41,870
What are you talking about right—

114
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:46,610
Whenever I was able to obtain more things and climb higher,

115
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:51,200
I thought you had made it happen for me.

116
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,550
So that's why I kept looking up to you and doing whatever you asked of me.

117
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:14,600
You're just... a perverted idiot who's crazy about murder.

118
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:22,860
What? You dare treat your daughter the same way as your lousy paintings?

119
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:27,440
You don't care about your daughter, whether she shares your blood or not.

120
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:32,770
You crazy bastard, just spend the rest of your life in there.

121
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:37,390
Until you rot and decay, die in there!

122
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:47,210
No... don't you dare come out even after you die.

123
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:56,620
Jang Hye Mi...

124
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:59,240
Hye Mi!

125
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,640
Again?

126
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:54,460
By releasing it to the media, we only got tons more useless leads.

127
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:59,930
Not like we can ignore them. It's such a waste of time! Why didn't you stop them?

128
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:03,460
I didn't know this was what the butterfly effect meant.

129
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:08,420
Instead of a typhoon, the mail keeps pouring in.

130
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,700
And also, why are there

131
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:15,030
so many wronged people!

132
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:16,970
Detective Joo...

133
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:29,230
Detective Cha! Prosecutor!

134
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:46,070
Detective Cha, we got real evidence!

135
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:46,940
Who sent them?

136
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:52,520
There was no return address, so it'll be difficult to find out.

137
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,490
We have all 10 cases?

138
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:55,850
Yes, all 10.

139
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:57,560
Okay then.

140
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:01,090
Even if we can't put him behind bars, we should be able to get him good!

141
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:03,690
But these two photos don't fit.

142
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:08,680
What are these? Another case?

143
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:17,390
     

144
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:19,130
April 2008...

145
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:22,180
Huh? Then that's within the statute of limitations.

146
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:24,770
What? Then we can put Gong In Woo behind bars?

147
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:29,150
Prepare to indict him for an 11th case.

148
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:31,830
Yes!

149
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:35,510
Please give us a statement!

150
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:41,690
Just one photo has caused an uproar,

151
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:46,940
and the murders of Gong In Woo from 32 years ago have all been confirmed.

152
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:52,270
Not only that, but new evidence has also come to light for another case within the statute of limitations

153
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:56,540
and Gong In Woo will now stand trial as a defendant again.

154
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:08,720
Today must be a special day. You look so happy.

155
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,700
Yes, I'm going to confess to someone I like.

156
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,280
Oh, I hope all goes well.

157
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:15,610
Here. I wish you the best.

158
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:18,490
Thank you.

159
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:34,820
 No, stay away! 

160
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:37,150
 Hyeong Bin, it's Gong Ji Cheol. 

161
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:18,360
Sa Bin?

162
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,400
Oh, she's here.

163
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:23,830
She usually doesn't pick up when she's drinking.

164
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:27,200
Okay then. Come here.

165
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,900
♫   My dear, you're going to leave me   ♫

166
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:35,360
Uncles, let me ask you one thing.

167
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,730
What is it? Dating advice?

168
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:42,370
If it's about love, you can ask me.

169
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:48,170
This is about... a friend of mine, you see.

170
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:52,500
I see. Not you but a friend? Yeah, what happened?

171
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:56,350
She likes someone.

172
00:14:56,350 --> 00:15:02,280
She gets excited when she sees him, and she wonders about him when she doesn't, and her heart beats for him.

173
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:05,380
Really? Who is he?

174
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:10,360
There's someone like that. A tall, cool, and intelligent person.

175
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:14,390
But he also likes my friend.

176
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:16,090
That's good then!

177
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:18,220
What's the problem?

178
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:24,560
The problem is... there's another man.

179
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,710
- A two-timer? 
 - That's not right.

180
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:29,080
Sa Bin, there's a limit.

181
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:32,920
There's such a thing as loyalty!

182
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,620
So? Keep going.

183
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:38,150
She just feels sorry for him whenever she sees him.

184
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:41,920
She feels bad and worries about him, and wants to hug him.

185
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:47,840
So... whenever she sees him, her heart hurts.

186
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:52,030
So, her heart beats for one man,

187
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:54,930
and for the other, her heart hurts?

188
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:56,690
That's it.

189
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:59,460
Now, tell me.

190
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:05,880
Uncles, which one do you think is real love?

191
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:08,110
- Beating! 
 - Hurting!

192
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:11,230
Do you want her to have a painful love

193
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:16,540
or beautiful love? At her age, a beating heart is real love.

194
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:19,500
Hey, that's why you don't know love.

195
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:23,090
Excitement is short-lived and sadness is long-lasting.

196
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:26,760
If you're to live together for life, you have to go for the long-lasting.

197
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:29,710
Sa Bin, what do you think?

198
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:31,830
She's sleeping.

199
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:37,260
Our Jong Beom!

200
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:40,080
Your timing is not so great!

201
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:43,330
You're here?

202
00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:44,890
What happened to...

203
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:47,460
Sa Bin is...

204
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:05,610
Gong Ji Cheol's name was cleared today.

205
00:17:05,610 --> 00:17:08,030
Thirty-two years later.

206
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:15,990
When this day came, I thought I could come to you without any shame.

207
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:19,410
But it wasn't true.

208
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:27,650
To you, I'm still a murderer.

209
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:36,830
I killed Yoon Jeong Hee and Cha Hyeong Bin.

210
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:40,950
In front of you at that.

211
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:51,850
Someone who remembers the worst part of me, why did it have to be you?

212
00:17:55,470 --> 00:18:02,710
When I think about that, I don't feel like I can ever come to you.

213
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,660
Oh, my head!

214
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,610
Did I teleport?

215
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:35,600
I know I was drinking at Uncles' place.

216
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:41,640
You're crazy, aren't you?

217
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:44,730
My head is going to split! Why are you hitting my head?

218
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:47,250
Then I should just hit you on your back! You're nuts!

219
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:48,570
You're insane!

220
00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:50,830
Now you drink and get piggybacked here by your student?

221
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:53,010
Student? Who?

222
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:54,420
Jong Beom?

223
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:56,050
He carried me here?

224
00:18:56,050 --> 00:18:58,620
That's right. Your stalker student.

225
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:01,670
Because of you, my blood will dry up and I'll become remains myself!

226
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:05,860
Then that wasn't a dream?

227
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:10,080
What's with your response? You're making me nervous.

228
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:16,330
I... heard something strange from Jong Beom.

229
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:26,060
 In order to save you, I killed Yoon Jeong Hee. 

230
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:34,210
  I wanted to give her heart to you. 

231
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:43,490
 Yoon Jeong Hee was a bad mother who killed her own child. 

232
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:55,880
 Even when I went to the snowy hill to seek salvation from you, 

233
00:19:55,880 --> 00:20:00,720
 everyone said I went to kill you. 

234
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:07,330
 I only wanted to confess to you for the last time and give you my heart. 

235
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:11,260
 I... I am... 

236
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:18,620
 Gong Ji Cheol! 

237
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:30,220
 No! 

238
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:34,480
 No one gave me a chance to speak. 

239
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:40,490
 No one... believed me. 

240
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:50,480
 Don't die. 

241
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,250
 I'll find you a heart. 

242
00:20:54,890 --> 00:21:00,050
 It was you who held my hand that day at the emergency room, wasn't it? 

243
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:03,950
 When I fainted in the phone booth, 

244
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:08,050
 you took me to the hospital, too. 

245
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,110
What do I do?

246
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:23,870
What do I do?

247
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:26,450
Hey! Where are you going in that state?

248
00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:39,060
♫   Meeting you   ♫

249
00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:46,020
♫   I don't want it to become a sad destiny   ♫

250
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:49,180
Is something wrong?

251
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:53,380
Did you really...

252
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:54,830
kill Yoon Jeong Hee for me?

253
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:58,460
♫   It remains even in flowing tears   ♫

254
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:02,670
To give me a heart?

255
00:22:02,670 --> 00:22:05,240
♫   Please let me be by your side  ♫

256
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:08,070
Then on the snowy hill, too,

257
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:14,830
you didn't come to kill me but to give me your heart?

258
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:17,950
♫   Even if I'm left alone again   ♫

259
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:20,980
It really wasn't a dream.

260
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:24,030
Sorry, I thought you were sleeping, so...

261
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:26,690
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

262
00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:30,450
How hard must it have been for you.

263
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:35,110
You were only trying to save me by doing those things.

264
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:38,710
But I... called you a beast.

265
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:43,470
I said you would never be born again.

266
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:48,330
Without realizing that, until the moment of death,

267
00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:52,690
I... hated you

268
00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:54,450
and blamed you.

269
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:58,460
♫   The place that remained far away  ♫

270
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:01,480
Whenever I fainted, you were the one who always saved me.

271
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,930
♫   In that dark and lonely place   ♫

272
00:23:03,930 --> 00:23:09,900
If not for you, I would have died sooner.

273
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:16,060
Then... I probably wouldn't have even met Hyeong Bin.

274
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:22,140
♫   I'm afraid to be lost again like your dreams   ♫

275
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:27,940
♫   Please let me be by your side   ♫

276
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:30,860
I'm sorry.

♫   Pain rushes into the heart   ♫

278
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:36,120
I'm sorry,

279
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:38,210
Gong Ji Cheol.

280
00:23:38,210 --> 00:23:43,580
♫   Even if I'm left alone again   ♫

281
00:23:56,670 --> 00:24:01,030
     

282
00:24:05,050 --> 00:24:06,860
I heard you had something to say to me.

283
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:10,090
I wanted to ask you for a good trial today.

284
00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:12,800
I will do my best.

285
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:19,970
I have a list of the remains you were hiding away in your safe.

286
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:24,490
I'm sure that won't matter if the trial goes well, but you never know.

287
00:24:24,490 --> 00:24:29,720
If it doesn't go well, I might want to use it to lash out.

288
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:32,640
Just be careful is what I'm telling you.

289
00:24:42,330 --> 00:24:50,030
At the last trial, defendant Baek Sang Ah provided an alibi for the charged murder of Gang Do Cheol.

290
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:53,260
Also, we established that on the charge of the attempted murder of Joo In Do,

291
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:57,280
his testimony had no credibility.

292
00:24:57,280 --> 00:25:01,020
Therefore, defendant Baek Sang Ah, on these two charges,

293
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:04,850
again pleads not guilty.

294
00:25:04,850 --> 00:25:06,120
   

295
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:08,100
   

296
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:11,100
Prosecution, please state your argument.

297
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:21,360
Prosecutor, do you have nothing more to say?

298
00:25:32,670 --> 00:25:37,450
On the day Detective Joo In Do was attacked by defendant Baek Sang Ah,

299
00:25:37,450 --> 00:25:42,800
someone witnessed it and reported it to the police. I call witness Cheon Jong Beom to the stand.

300
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:51,490
Please swear in as a witness.

301
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:59,850
I swear to tell the truth according to my conscience without hiding or adding,

302
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:04,100
and if there is a lie, I swear to be punished for perjury.

303
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:05,970
Witness, Cheon Jong Beom.

304
00:26:05,970 --> 00:26:09,030
Prosecution, please state your argument.

305
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:26,360
Thank you for keeping your word.

306
00:26:31,030 --> 00:26:36,340
Before I begin the questioning, I'll show you the evidence the witness has submitted.

307
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:54,630
Order!

308
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:02,620
Mom.

309
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:04,830
Mom!

310
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:06,750
Mom!

311
00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:24,120
Here's the verdict.

312
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:28,660
Defendant Baek Sang Ah, pursuant to article 250, paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law,

313
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:31,290
is sentenced to life in prison.

314
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:37,440
Without your evidence, we would have lost today.

315
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:41,110
Thanks for waiting and trusting me to the end.

316
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:46,230
Since the beginning, I never intended to hand the file over to Jang Hye Mi.

317
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:49,680
I also had a debt to pay to Baek Sang Ah.

318
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:57,310
And let me apologize properly.

319
00:27:57,310 --> 00:28:02,040
To you in our past lives and in our present lives, too,

320
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:07,480
I'm sorry. I mean it.

321
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:16,370
I didn't realize receiving an apology from someone would be this comforting.

322
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:25,220
I also apologize.

323
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:33,700
I... killed you.

324
00:28:34,390 --> 00:28:37,390
On top of that, in front of someone you loved.

325
00:28:39,310 --> 00:28:44,460
Someone who looked good with a fountain pen and in a uniform,

326
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:48,540
a man who Jeong Ha Eun loved...

327
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:56,850
I was jealous of you.

328
00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:11,950
I'm sure there's still homework left to be done.

329
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:17,690
I have to find out who tried to kill me.

330
00:29:31,130 --> 00:29:37,290
 Gong Ji Cheol could be watching you from very close. 

331
00:29:37,290 --> 00:29:40,420
 Even if the body disappears, 

332
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:43,650
 the wronged soul will come back. 

333
00:29:44,370 --> 00:29:46,250
Come in.

334
00:29:51,150 --> 00:29:53,270
What brings you by?

335
00:29:54,090 --> 00:29:55,390
I have a question to ask.

336
00:29:55,390 --> 00:29:57,230
What is it that you're here at this hour?

337
00:29:57,230 --> 00:30:00,380
I met a man by chance not too long ago.

338
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:05,390
When he saw me he trembled, saying that Gong Ji Cheol had come back to life.

339
00:30:05,390 --> 00:30:06,260
What?

340
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:12,250
You met him in person, so you would know well.

341
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:18,240
To you, do I look that similar to Gong Ji Cheol, too?

342
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:24,690
What's wrong with you?

343
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:27,180
What did he say?

344
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:33,040
Cheon Seok Tae told him that if he didn't keep his mouth shut,

345
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:35,860
he wouldn't leave him or his daughter alone.

346
00:30:38,850 --> 00:30:41,100
Who are you?

347
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:43,550
Did you kill me?

348
00:30:57,970 --> 00:31:05,080
 Timing and Subtitles by the Reborn Team @ viki 

349
00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:12,710
♫   I just hope it's not you   ♫

350
00:31:12,710 --> 00:31:14,090
     

351
00:31:14,090 --> 00:31:17,180
 I'm now certain who I like. 

352
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:18,250
 I'm leaving tomorrow to study abroad. 

353
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:19,400
 Can you not go? 

354
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,540
 Are you really going to leave like this?  
    

355
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:22,220
 Think about it as homework for the rest of your life. 

356
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:25,520
 Sending away someone I love, I guess my heart can't withstand it. 

357
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:27,840
 You said she could live if she receives surgery. 

358
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,570
 I shouldn't have told you. 

359
00:31:29,570 --> 00:31:31,400
 You have to stay with Jeong Sa Bin. 

360
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,880
 I will recover for your sake. 

361
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,120
 You still have a chance. 

362
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:36,430
 When you're discharged, let's go somewhere where we can see the stars well. 

363
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:39,500
 I now have a reason to live. I want to live.
