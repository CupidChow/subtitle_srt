1
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:07,140
   

2
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:15,130
     

3
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:21,610
Prosecutor Kim.

4
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:26,400
Are you sure you have proof?

5
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,510
I want to ask you.

6
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:31,690
For someone who knows psychopaths so well,

7
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:36,470
how did you not recognize the one right next to you?

8
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:14,320
The Yellow Umbrella killer was... your fiancÃ©e.

9
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:17,660
How could you end up with that kind of a woman?

10
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:03,710
Ms. Baek Sang Ah, do you acknowledge

11
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:07,750
murdering Im Hwa Yeong on March 10th, 2020?

12
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:25,650
Attempted murder of Detective Joo and killing and abandoning Kim Hee Soo,

13
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:28,930
killing Gang Do Cheol, do you acknowledge all of them?

14
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:30,020
Soo Hyeok.

15
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:34,680
I asked if you acknowledge them, Ms. Baek Sang Ah.

16
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:45,020
Did you really kill them?

17
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:45,830
I don't know.

18
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:50,720
You've been killing people while I was with you?

19
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:54,770
You knew how much I hate animals like that.

20
00:02:56,950 --> 00:03:00,780
Why? Why did you kill them?

21
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:05,620
Tell me.

22
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:09,310
Do you know something?

23
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:14,860
At this moment, all your attention is on me.

24
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:22,340
What kind of person am I? Did I really kill people?

25
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:25,590
You're sincerely curious about me.

26
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:27,120
What?

27
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:32,290
I'm going to tell you one by one very slowly.

28
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:35,520
Only you, Prosecutor Kim.

29
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:43,170
That way, I can see you here like this for a long time.

30
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:50,090
What is your relationship to Gong In Woo?

31
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:52,310
Who is he?

32
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:57,090
You're so curious about me.

33
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,450
I like it.

34
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:25,990
In Do, there's a scratch on her wrist.

35
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:27,480
Check under the nails of the victim.

36
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:30,710
Pardon? Yes.

37
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:54,070
     

38
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:12,200
It's me. The remains of the convict, make sure it's resolved as unidentifiable.

39
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,670
Make sure it can't be reconstructed.

40
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:23,350
Chief Prosecutor, Ms. Jang Hye Mi is here.

41
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:25,280
You may let her in.

42
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:49,660
Did you come because of your daughter?

43
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:54,020
It's not so surprising such a child was born in your family.

44
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:57,770
What could she have learned from a mother who protects a murderer?

45
00:05:57,770 --> 00:06:03,820
That's the reason I broke up with you 30 years ago.

46
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:06,170
Lack of morals.

47
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,410
I'll give you five minutes.

48
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:12,500
Gong Ji Cheol came back alive.

49
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,490
Gong Ji Cheol?

50
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:18,220
Right. He did, not too long ago.

51
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:19,960
He's lying in the autopsy room as we speak.

52
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,750
I've already fixed it so that he's unidentifiable and cannot be reconstructed.

53
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:26,150
Did you come here because you were scared about it?

54
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:38,640
What you really need to be scared about is the case from 30 years ago,

55
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:45,990
the Yellow Umbrella killer. The fact that Gong Ji Cheol isn't the real culprit.

56
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:51,950
And... you and I conspiring together and killing Gong Ji Cheol...

57
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:54,570
You haven't forgotten, have you?

58
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,230
So?

59
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:00,520
Let Sang Ah go.

60
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,370
She's committed murder.

61
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:05,350
So did you 30 years ago.

62
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:07,560
- What? 
 - Let my daughter go.

63
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,460
If I say no?

64
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:21,780
You're the one who knows best in the world about how scary the power of a pen is.

65
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:25,560
It's no fun to provoke someone who holds a pen.

66
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,490
Hey, Jang Hye Mi.

67
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:31,170
If it goes to trial, make it closed to the public, and I'll be my daughter's attorney.

68
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:33,590
Pick out a prosecutor in charge for me.

69
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:34,660
Why don't you get up now?

70
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:41,710
Gong Ji Cheol, he could be watching you from very close by.

71
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:52,270
Because even if the body disappears, a wronged soul returns.

72
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:55,780
Sounds like you've recently joined a religious group.

73
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:27,960
Big Bro! Who does he think he is?

74
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:30,500
Are you going to let him put his feet up on the table?

75
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,590
Ma Cheol, how old are you?

76
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:36,430
You know that I'm... 22.

77
00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:39,460
Call him Big Bro from now on.

78
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:42,460
No, maybe you need to call him your ancestor.

79
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:44,910
Ancestor?

80
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:50,260
Jong Beom, since I saved your life, I'm still your Big Bro. Right?

81
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:51,290
Did you get what I asked?

82
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:54,280
Hey, you punk! You bastard!

83
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,520
How dare you speak informally?!

84
00:08:56,520 --> 00:09:02,300
Do I need to remove my jacket to prove that I'm a gangster? Where is he looking?

85
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:04,420
Big Bro, sorry. Let me take my jacket off.

86
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:06,330
Chang Soon, how old are you?

87
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:07,990
45, Big Bro.

88
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:10,200
- You're 45? 
 - Yes.

89
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,500
You can be friends then.

90
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:20,900
I got the kids to dig it up. Why do you need it?

91
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,450
Also, you asked me to find someone for you.

92
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:32,670
Your stepmother, was it? She doesn't see too well.

93
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:04,150
 Ms. J states that the novel is fiction based on facts 

94
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:05,490
 and unrelated to her daughter's case. 

95
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:33,870
I gave you your last chance, but you threw it away.

96
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:37,010
Are you saying I'm next after Gong In Woo?

97
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:39,050
You might be.

98
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:45,630
I guess you're still angry that I lied to you 30 years ago.

99
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:53,290
It's funny. Even your biological father betrayed you.

100
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:57,310
Aren't you pushing it to ask me for goodwill as a human being?

101
00:10:57,310 --> 00:11:01,930
The way you're speaking today is Cheon Jong Beom.

102
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:04,500
It's oddly different.

103
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:08,380
Your feelings are still alive.

104
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:10,250
Yeah?

105
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:27,020
What could the secret of the real killer you missed in the book be?

106
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:33,250
While Gong In Woo killed, Gong Ji Cheol gathered up victims' belongings that could prove their identities.

107
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:35,120
Among them, there's something that belonged to your stepfather, too.

108
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,790
 (ID card for Gu Sang Gu) 

109
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:50,200
I'm going to ask two questions right now. Give me answers that I can understand.

110
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:55,910
First, who sent the thugs to Gong Ji Cheol at Wonnam Hospital to kill him?

111
00:11:57,570 --> 00:12:00,090
Who do you think?

112
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:03,420
It was the prosecutor in charge of Gong Ji Cheol's execution.

113
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:06,080
Cheon Seok Tae?

114
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:08,210
It's your father.

115
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:15,170
Second, Baek Sang Ah calls me her friend.

116
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:19,910
She said you've been watching me since I was born.

117
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:22,320
What does it mean?

118
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,950
Sang Ah?  Sang Ah, how did she...

119
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:27,750
Your answer.

120
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:34,520
The person who designed your DNA...

121
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:39,040
it wasn't your mom, it was me.

122
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:44,240
At Inseong Foundation's fertility clinic,

123
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:48,800
I once switched some donated sperm.

124
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:52,690
Your biological father

125
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:57,660
wasn't a top 1% genius in Korea.

126
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,890
I don't know who it was.

127
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:06,260
It was donated to the hospital anonymously.

128
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:10,410
Why did you...

129
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:12,260
do that to me?

130
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:19,070
At first, I wanted to place something foreign in Cheon Seok Tae's life.

131
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:23,650
Since we're very ill-fated.

132
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:27,240
I saw you for the first time when you were 13.

133
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:32,320
That day, I recognized right away that you were not an ordinary person.

134
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:37,150
So I only wanted to watch you from afar.

135
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:48,300
Writer Jang Hye Mi, a bundle of lies. I want to reveal that to the world.

136
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:55,410
I guess you want to prove Gong Ji Cheol's innocence,

137
00:13:55,410 --> 00:14:00,720
but remember, I'm the only one in the world who can prove

138
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,430
you were wrongly accused 32 years ago.

139
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:08,630
Now it's become very clear what we need from each other.

140
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:15,220
How Prosecutor Cheon made Gong Ji Cheol into an uncommon serial killer,

141
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:18,790
bring the evidence to me.

142
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:23,970
You... had so much evidence.

143
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:28,020
Why didn't you show it to Prosecutor Cheon 32 years ago?

144
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:30,770
Would that have changed anything?

145
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:35,230
He probably would have assumed it was trophies I collected from the murders.

146
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:41,730
You also knew Gong In Woo was the murderer, but nothing changed.

147
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:44,630
Since I was expendable.

148
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:52,620
Heathcliff's revenge when he returned was because of love.

149
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:57,480
Is it because of love for you, too?

150
00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:56,580
You did it while eating like this.

151
00:15:57,570 --> 00:16:02,520
Do you remember stabbing me with the scissors while I ate?

152
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:04,640
Who are you?

153
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:05,910
Why did you do that?

154
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:08,950
I asked who you are.

155
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:11,350
Your son, Gong Ji Cheol.

156
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:13,350
What?

157
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:17,720
How could you say something like that?

158
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:21,050
Every time I got stabbed in the eye, I thought,

159
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:26,020
"I really hope Mom's anger subsides quickly today.

160
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:29,130
Let's just put up with it a little longer.

161
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:33,730
If I put up with it a little more,

162
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:38,440
Mom will be nice to me today."

163
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:44,720
But I realized once I got stabbed in the eye.

164
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:49,000
To you, I wasn't a human being,

165
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:52,370
I was an object.

166
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:56,760
A very dirty object that didn't matter

167
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:01,950
if it died and got chucked in the trash.

168
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:08,130
Are you... really Ji Cheol?

169
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:11,120
I thought I should live no matter what.

170
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:19,810
The only means of getting revenge on you was for me to stay alive and become an adult

171
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:22,460
and for you to get old.

172
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:36,430
But... even meeting like this...

173
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:40,560
I can't get revenge on you.

174
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:16,520
   

175
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:20,560
 Do you want to have a party as a family? 

176
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:33,200
Our Jong Beom has become a real man since I last saw him!

177
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,860
Listen, Jong Beom, it's Sa Bin's birthday soon.

178
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:38,520
Let's go on a family vacation together.

179
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:42,200
Your face just begs for my affection.

180
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,270
Why don't you just be our nephew-in-law?

181
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:49,060
Uncle, let's not cross the line.

182
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:53,610
It's not the DMZ. What line can you not cross as a man and a woman?

183
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:54,610
Never you mind!

184
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:59,210
Jong Beom, tell me. You like Sa Bin, don't you?

185
00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:03,770
I can tell by looking at your eyes! I'm a pro!

186
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:05,460
Uncle, come on!

187
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:08,780
Yes, I like her.

188
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:16,350
Sa Bin, how do you feel?

189
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:18,550
We like each other as teacher and student.

190
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:21,430
Isn't that a given? He's my favorite pupil.

191
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:26,040
Sa Bin, when you see him, is he cool or pitiful?

192
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:28,630
When a woman really loves a man,

193
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:31,820
she feels pity for him, that's what I heard.

194
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:34,580
Like a mom, you want to comfort him and embrace him.

195
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:37,390
If people say anything to him, you want to fight them off.

196
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:42,230
That's real, real love.

197
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:47,400
Is that so? If you know so much, why are you still single?

198
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,650
There's not even one woman

199
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:55,490
who pities me! It's my fate to be lonely.

200
00:20:55,490 --> 00:20:57,210
You're the same.

201
00:20:57,210 --> 00:20:59,660
This little weasel!

202
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:04,100
Fine! Let's die together so that you and I won't be lonely!

203
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:06,870
I'll warmly embrace you in my arms!

204
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:12,100
â«   Because you were the first to come close   â«

205
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:16,680
â«   Even if it's a love I can't fulfill   â«

206
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:19,580
 I like you. I like you, 

207
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:21,700
 so you can never get hurt. 

208
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:26,620
 To be honest, since the first time I saw you, my heart raced. 

209
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:30,050
â«   I can't   â«

210
00:21:30,050 --> 00:21:35,600
â«   Even though I know you can't come to me   â«

211
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,100
 Can I ask why you shot me? 

212
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:40,120
 Because you tried to kill Jeong Sa Bin. 

213
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:42,670
 Are you still suspecting Jong Beom? 

214
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:47,500
 As much you like Jeong Sa Bin, Baek Sang Ah will want to kill her. 

215
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:50,120
â«   Even while exhausted   â«

216
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:54,220
â«   I say that I'm fine   â«

217
00:21:55,100 --> 00:22:01,320
â«   Even though it hurts, this is not goodbye   â«

218
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:04,510
When is your birthday?

219
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:07,520
Me? May 31st.

220
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:13,240
The day my father carried out his first execution, I was born. Isn't it unique?

221
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:19,950
So the person I can't forgive as long as I live is that convict, Gong Ji Cheol.

222
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:25,740
You haven't seen the face of the convict whose remains we reconstructed, have you?

223
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:33,600
I think he looks like you.

224
00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:37,850
In what way?

225
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:43,670
He looks lonely. It hurts me.

226
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:45,980
I'm really...

227
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:48,620
It's an illness. Being excessively absorbed in the remains.

228
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:51,320
You don't need to have sympathy.

229
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:57,540
His bones were broken everywhere, his eyes were stabbed, and he was nutritionally deficient.

230
00:22:57,540 --> 00:23:02,320
His scars were mostly from when he was young.

231
00:23:04,010 --> 00:23:10,800
If he had been loved, he could have lived another kind of life.

232
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,810
I don't think so.

233
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:19,110
The relationship formed with that convict would have been completely ill-fated.

234
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:23,800
It might not have been an ill-fated relationship, just a fated one.

235
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:28,450
Maybe he became a convict because he didn't get to form those relationships sooner.

236
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,900
Had the relationship come sooner, he might not

237
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:35,810
have lived like that and died that way.

238
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:46,940
Yes, Prosecutor Kim.

239
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:51,230
 Can I see you for a bit? 

240
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:55,210
What's wrong with your voice? Is something wrong?

241
00:23:57,330 --> 00:23:59,640
Okay, I'll do that.

242
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:04,180
Sorry, Prosecutor Kim needs to talk to me.

243
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:06,500
Go ahead, I'll wait.

244
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:10,230
Here? You don't know how long it'll take.

245
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:11,410
I'll wait.

246
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:13,990
You're not even well. Go inside.

247
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:22,970
 Jeong Ha Eun, how long... 

248
00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:25,760
 can you wait for me? 

249
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:33,250
   

250
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:40,290
Why did you drink so much?

251
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:48,920
Can I... hug you for a moment?

252
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:03,260
You hate me, don't you?

253
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:09,760
I can't get close to you because I know how you feel about me.

254
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,500
â«   Your eyes looking at me  â«

255
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:14,070
I know I'm a murderer in your eyes.

256
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:18,790
Jong Beom came back safe and sound.

257
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:22,290
You're not a murderer, Prosecutor Kim.

258
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:30,050
â«   When I look at you, the whole world  â«

259
00:25:30,050 --> 00:25:35,940
â«   seems to have stopped while filled with you  â«

260
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:38,390
Prosecutor Kim,

261
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:41,500
you're drunk. That's enough now.

262
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:45,640
â«   Even if someday a difficult time comes for us  â«

263
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:50,250
Prosecutor Kim...

264
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:56,790
I realized that I was the one who put the person I wanted to protect the most in the most danger.

265
00:25:56,790 --> 00:25:59,990
And that being next to you

266
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:03,770
isn't protecting you.

267
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:08,930
I'll put everything back in its place.

268
00:26:08,930 --> 00:26:11,760
I'll put everything back,

269
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:15,640
and then...

270
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,930
I'll come to you.

271
00:26:24,930 --> 00:26:31,740
I also... want to be happy with the man I like.

272
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:36,700
But each time I feel that way, someone always comes to mind.

273
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:39,680
Until that person won't be unhappy anymore,

274
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:45,750
I can't leave that person alone.

275
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:49,720
I've thought many times about why that is,

276
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:57,020
but I've just felt that way toward him since the beginning.

277
00:26:57,020 --> 00:27:01,800
â«  I love you  â«

278
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:05,890
â«  Even if an unexpected farewell comes to find me  â«

279
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:09,720
Are you talking about Cheon Jong Beom?

280
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:14,700
â«   I will not leave  â«

281
00:27:15,930 --> 00:27:21,180
â«   Even if the warm wind carries me away  â«

282
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:24,670
â«   You're my one and only love  â«

283
00:27:24,670 --> 00:27:29,150
â«   Don't let go of my hand  â«

284
00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:30,890
â«   My dear   â«

285
00:27:30,890 --> 00:27:37,970
â«   Even if we don't say anything, even if I'm just looking at you  â«

286
00:27:37,970 --> 00:27:43,670
â«   You're the one I want to see  â«

287
00:27:43,670 --> 00:27:46,690
 You should think about having surgery now. 

288
00:27:46,690 --> 00:27:52,470
 If the bullet moves, you could die at any moment. 

289
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,610
   

290
00:27:55,610 --> 00:27:58,900
   

291
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:01,900
I was about to call you, but you called.

292
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,700
We connected.

293
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:06,870
I guess so.

294
00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:09,650
I was worried after leaving like that.

295
00:28:09,650 --> 00:28:13,090
Where are you? You can't be wondering around right now.

296
00:28:13,090 --> 00:28:17,740
You're the one who left a sick person behind to go see a man. How can you nag at me?

297
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:23,310
Anyway, I'll send you the address, so lets text after work.

298
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:37,630
It's pretty.

299
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,390
They're pretty.

300
00:28:52,390 --> 00:28:58,220
These trees were thrown out from the city development housing sites.

301
00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:02,910
They were moved and planted here, so this place became a tree orphanage.

302
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:05,470
Tree orphanage?

303
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:15,650
That tree was sick and weak before coming here,

304
00:29:15,650 --> 00:29:19,040
so the rotten branches had to be cut

305
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,580
They attached artificial bark to the tree.

306
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:25,960
It was going to grow that big, but it nearly got abandoned.

307
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:28,460
You told me yourself.

308
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:33,690
Primitive tribes tie ribbons on trees and make wishes.

309
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:42,700
Will the wish come true... even if you tie a ribbon around a tree that's been hurt?

310
00:29:44,410 --> 00:29:47,660
What's your wish?

311
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:54,790
 Revenge... and... 

312
00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:57,560
There's something called an injury-time in soccer.

313
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:03,960
The game is over, but it's time given by the referee.

314
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:11,100
Unsettling for the winner, but a time when the loser can still hope for a reversal.

315
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:11,870
â«   A sad destiny   â«

316
00:30:11,870 --> 00:30:17,260
I'm thinking about what I'd do if injury-time comes to my life.

317
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:20,310
Injury-time? Hey, you're really...

318
00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:25,270
You have a promising future ahead of you. What do you mean injury-time?

319
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:26,970
Tell me what your wish is.

320
00:30:26,970 --> 00:30:30,730
From now on, I'll pray for your wish to come true, too.

321
00:30:30,730 --> 00:30:34,610
In two lifetimes, I've only loved one woman.

322
00:30:34,610 --> 00:30:37,240
â«   Please let me be by your side  â«

323
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:40,690
Just once... couldn't you look at me?

324
00:30:40,690 --> 00:30:46,070
â«   Pain rushes into the heart   â«

325
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:53,650
â«   Even if I'm left alone again   â«

326
00:30:55,130 --> 00:31:02,090

327
00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:18,020
â«   The memory of you that can't be erased   â«

328
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:23,660
â«   So that it won't be sad anymore    â«

329
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:31,060
â«   The place that remained far away  â«

330
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:38,690
â«   In that dark and lonely place   â«

331
00:31:38,690 --> 00:31:40,250
     

332
00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:42,670
 I found a way to take care of all three at once. 

333
00:31:42,670 --> 00:31:45,060
 Gong Ji Cheol, I'm sorry. 

334
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:46,360
 Are you sure it was Baek Sang Ah? 

335
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:48,100
 I remember the suspect's face very clearly. 

336
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:50,130
 I'm going to do everything I can for you. 

337
00:31:50,130 --> 00:31:53,550
 The more you corner her, the more you'll put Jeong Sa Bin in danger, not yourself. 

338
00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:55,150
 You take Kim Soo Hyeok out. 

339
00:31:55,150 --> 00:31:57,140
 I'll put everything back in its place and come to you. 

340
00:31:57,140 --> 00:32:00,430
 I'll make you remember me first.
