1
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:05,410
   

2
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:11,510
   

3
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:20,470
 Timing and Subtitles by the Reborn Team @ viki 

4
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:30,730
 I just wanted to see her one more time. 

5
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:32,650
 Jeong Ha Eun. 

6
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:42,480
It's time for "Inside a Case."

7
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,770
Our guest today is the novelist who wrote "The Murderer's Secret"

8
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:48,760
and Korea's answer to John Grisham, who was a lawyer at the time of Gong Ji Cheol's trial.

9
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:51,310
Our guest today is novelist Jang Hye Mi.

10
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:53,220
Welcome.

11
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:57,010
First, can we call you an expert on Gong Ji Cheol?

12
00:03:57,010 --> 00:03:58,720
Not at all.

13
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:05,920
I just wrote a book by collecting the scribbles written on the walls of his solitary cell.

14
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,230
But here, there's a poem.

15
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:12,270
"A bone escapes a birdcage.

16
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:17,540
A bone that cried while alive when the world and life were split apart.

17
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:23,030
Leaving behind its robe of feathers, it walks out, whistling."

18
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:28,140
It's the poem Gong Ji Cheol scribbled the day before his execution.

19
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:33,130
Looking at the conclusion of your book, it ends with Gong Ji Cheol being alive.

20
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:37,310
Is Gong Ji Cheol really alive?

21
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:45,420
Nobody thinks Jack the Ripper or the Zodiac killer are alive, but we still talk about them.

22
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:48,010
The same goes for Gong Ji Cheol.

23
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:53,530
So couldn't it be that someone is copying Gong Ji Cheol's murders for attention?

24
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:58,060
Do you think of Gong Ji Cheol as a psychopath?

25
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:08,460
I have interviewed many serial murderers,

26
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:12,760
but Gong Ji Cheol... was not a psychopath.

27
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,720
He was not a psychopath?

28
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:21,200
Gong Ji Cheol had all the feelings that a human can have.

29
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:24,630
He even sensed beauty.

30
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:29,320
He liked books and loved music.

31
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:35,090
At first, he was just like us.

32
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:48,410
   

33
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:49,590
   

34
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:51,140
   

35
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:52,300
   

36
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:55,640
 ["I wanted to live.'} 

37
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:21,920
 That woman is alive. 

38
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:20,420
   

39
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:24,790
Why is this buried here, Father?

40
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:27,860
You know something, don't you?

41
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:29,960
Father!

42
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:36,600
He thought of resurrection, that child.

43
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:40,630
Who is that child?

44
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:44,280
Cheon Jong Beom?

45
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:51,450
No! I'm not at the school. I'm at the museum of skeletal remains.

46
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:55,170
I don't know what he's doing, but he's not coming out.

47
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:12,050
Why are you tying ribbons on the tree?

48
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:16,370
It's an East Asian ritual that carries the wishes of resurrection.

49
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:21,960
The flesh is dead but the soul becomes a butterfly. The hope is that it flies away.

50
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,310
In the national myth within Eurasia,

51
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:34,330
ribbons symbolize the border between this life and the afterlife.

52
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:29,890
   

53
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:37,690
The natives of Altai are known to hang ribbons on sacred trees like this and make wishes,

54
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:43,180
so that the people they love will be resurrected and come back.

55
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:24,470
When I see your face at the museum of remains,

56
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:26,870
there are moments when you seem like someone else.

57
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:31,820
Someone I don't know, but then again,

58
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:34,290
like someone I think I might know very well.

59
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:40,330
Prosecutor Kim Soo Hyeok.

60
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:57,720
Can I ask you to accompany me voluntarily?

61
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:00,300
Today, the remains of a baby were found at the Haneul Garden Cathedral.

62
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:02,370
Remains?

63
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:06,590
Accompany you voluntarily... as a suspect

64
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:08,540
or as a witness?

65
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:10,950
You'll know when you get there.

66
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:12,110
What's going on?

67
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:17,940
It's nothing, so don't worry, Professor.

68
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:20,460
I asked you, what's going on?

69
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:25,800
Let's go.

70
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,350
Stay here, Jeong Sa Bin.

71
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:21,130
It's more comfortable seeing each other here. We should have done this sooner.

72
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:23,250
Don't you think so?

73
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:28,570
Cheon Jong Beom, no... Should I call you Cheon Eun Woo?

74
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:30,910
You can call me what you like.

75
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:43,030
The box with the baby's remains had your fingerprints all over it.

76
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:47,450
The priest said that you buried it yourself.

77
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:50,890
So do you think that I killed that child?

78
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:55,610
Your imagination is feebler than I thought,

79
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:58,950
Prosecutor Kim Soo Hyeok.

80
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:00,500
Is that so?

81
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,780
Then tell me what kind of imagination I need.

82
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:08,130
That child...is Im Hwa Yeong's.

83
00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:12,160
- What?
 - Extract the DNA and check.

84
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,900
DNA... So you're saying—

85
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:22,510
The day Im Hwa Yeong died, she drunkenly confessed something to me.

86
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:27,230
That she killed her own child with her own hands.

87
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:32,790
- So? 
 - I found the child buried in the mountains.

88
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:37,980
After that, I moved the child's remains to the cathedral and buried them.

89
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:40,450
You want me to believe that?

90
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:42,870
I'm just giving you the facts.

91
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:46,000
I guess it's up to you whether to believe it or not.

92
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,470
How did you know where the child was buried?

93
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:53,910
How would I know that? I heard it directly from Im Hwa Yeong.

94
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:56,150
Forget it.

95
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:58,900
Fine. Let's say that's what happened.

96
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:03,610
Then why? Why did you do that?

97
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:08,910
You dug up something that was already buried, put it in a box,

98
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:13,000
and took it to the cathedral and buried it. Why?

99
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,470
Did you become close to Im Hwa Yeong after running her errands?

100
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:21,320
Or was it Im Hwa Yeong's final request before she died?

101
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:24,930
You killed Im Hwa Yeong.

102
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:27,770
I felt sorry for the child.

103
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:30,050
Felt sorry?

104
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:36,450
I guess you've come up with a story, but who would ever believe someone like you?

105
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:42,740
You're a guy who killed a girl when you were 15.

106
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:45,840
Do you want me to recite your juvenile criminal record for you again?

107
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:52,990
It's also a fact that you killed a girl back then.

108
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:58,010
- Maybe... 
 - Maybe?

109
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:06,760
I'm really curious about something.

110
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:10,510
Why did you ring the bell of Im Hwa Yeong's next-door neighbor before killing her?

111
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:13,860
The bell next door?

112
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:17,790
I rang the bell next door?

113
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:30,060
But what does the bell next door have to do with the socks?

114
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:33,270
You rang the bell next door and waved your hand with socks on it.

115
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:36,430
A guy like you wouldn't ring the doorbell next door by mistake.

116
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:39,550
Let's hear why you set up a witness.

117
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:04,260
Prosecutor.

118
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:15,500
The Chief Prosecutor is calling.

119
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:30,930
We found Cheon Jong Beom's fingerprints on the remains found in the cathedral so we're investigating.

120
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:33,030
Whether there were fingerprints or DNA,

121
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:38,330
Soo Hyeok, you make things out of what doesn't exist and make things that do exist disappear.

122
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:42,700
But why did you do it this time?

123
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:46,440
Why?

124
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:51,240
Should we round up the guys that you imprisoned by fabricating warrants

125
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,690
and hold a press conference?

126
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,480
Soo Hyeok.

127
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,660
Yes, Chief Prosecutor.

128
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:03,310
Do you want to make me your enemy?

129
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:49,880
   

130
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:07,710
 Why do people act like victims when they are the assailants?  

131
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:16,740
 That woman killed her child ten years ago 

132
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:20,180
 but she says her dead child is torturing her. 

133
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:26,350
 I'm going to throw these away. 

134
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:31,450
 So they can't torture me anymore. 

135
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,980
 I'll throw them out. 

136
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:37,160
  I'm throwing them out, okay? 

137
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:42,180
 Goodbye. 

138
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:44,180
  I threw them away. 

139
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:21,630
 You cannot throw your sins away. 

140
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:24,690
 They shouldn't grow faint like pictures soaked in rain. 

141
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:29,000
 They must remain in your heart. 

142
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:51,730
   

143
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:56,640
 And... blood must be repaid with blood. 

144
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:08,760
 If you created a witness for me, it looks like you didn't get the result you wanted. 

145
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:39,890
   

146
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:46,770
 I think I'll find you before then. 

147
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,790
Mom, are you okay?

148
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:12,960
You must miss Prosecutor Kim a lot. Why are you driving so roughly?

149
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:27,170
 Where are you? 

150
00:21:27,170 --> 00:21:30,030
 You know the place I go often near the practice room, right? 

151
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:31,950
I'm on my way.

152
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,740
Please change the music.

153
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:51,820
Do I have to listen to the sound of violins here, too?

154
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:54,510
Please be understanding, she's a violinist.

155
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:57,650
The sound of strings probably sounds five times louder for her than for other people.

156
00:21:57,650 --> 00:21:59,920
Yes, I understand.

157
00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:10,360
Your taste hasn't changed.

158
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:13,910
I like the taste of young and tender ones.

159
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:16,120
How about you, Soo Hyeok? Is it to your taste?

160
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:18,890
I'm just eating it because you like it.

161
00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:25,280
I heard that you're investigating the Gong Ji Cheol tribute murder cases.

162
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:29,270
If the culprit commits the murders to commemorate Gong Ji Cheol,

163
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:32,350
he would only select Gong Ji Cheol's desired targets and kill them.

164
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:35,260
Soo Hyeok, did you see my mom's television appearance?

165
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:37,300
She's an expert on Gong Ji Cheol.

166
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:41,820
So who do you think those targets are? Targets that Gong Ji Cheol would kill.

167
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:47,040
Well, Gong Ji Cheol couldn't kill the person he loved.

168
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:50,950
If he was alive, who would he want to kill?

169
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:53,310
A psychopath had someone he loved?

170
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:55,500
Of course, he did.

171
00:22:55,500 --> 00:23:00,460
Gong Ji Cheol's tragedy begins when he's abandoned by his mother.

172
00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:04,850
The word "tragedy" is a bit unpleasant to hear, Mother-in-Law.

173
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:08,380
I do agree with you on one thing.

174
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:11,890
Murder isn't something you can stop with your own will.

175
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:16,100
The child we talked about before... observe him well.

176
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:19,420
That child? Who's that?

177
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,180
Excuse me for a second.

178
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:38,570
We can make a bet. He's definitely going to commit murder.

179
00:23:38,570 --> 00:23:40,240
That child, Cheon Jong Beom.

180
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,020
You make bets on people's lives.

181
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:46,170
I saw that child for the first time when he was 13.

182
00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:51,480
He was very interested in Gong Ji Cheol. So I gave him a book as a present.

183
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:56,370
You gave a 13-year-old child a book about a serial murderer as a present...

184
00:23:56,370 --> 00:24:01,200
I can see through psychopaths.

185
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,450
I know how to manage them.

186
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:11,280
There was no one who understood him in that house. He was bound to come and find me at some point.

187
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:14,390
When he did, I wanted him to be honest with me.

188
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:18,110
So did he come and find you?

189
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:23,340
No. His mentality was stronger than I thought.

190
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:29,270
Just watch and see. That child will have great success in his field.

191
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:32,210
Though I hope it isn't murder.

192
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:53,320
 Just watch and see. 

193
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:57,320
 That child will have great success in his field. 

194
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,140
 Though I hope it isn't murder. 

195
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:12,880
     

196
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,480
     

197
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:18,820
     

198
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:32,970
 My goodness, she was talking about killing her own month-old baby with a pillow! 

199
00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:37,870
 Gong Ji Cheol's tragedy begins when he's abandoned by his mother.  

200
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:42,520
 The person who gave 'The Murderer's Secret" to a 13-year-old and the person who read it. 

201
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:48,460
 The novelist who commemorates Gong Ji Cheol and the person who became one with Gong Ji Cheol. 

202
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:55,100
 Instead of Gong Ji Cheol who was abandoned by his mother, judging the woman who threw away her child... 

203
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:57,230
 He's definitely going to commit murder. 

204
00:25:57,230 --> 00:25:59,100
 That child. Cheon Jong Beom. 

205
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:02,660
 I felt sorry for the child. 

206
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:05,660
 I asked you, what's going on? 

207
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:08,430
Why do you keep her next to you?

208
00:26:10,990 --> 00:26:13,260
Is it that good?

209
00:26:23,610 --> 00:26:25,100
My heart!

210
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:28,690
Tonight, I want to be your vampire.

211
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:33,430
What are you saying? You don't even look strong enough to suck blood.

212
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:35,490
Uncle, he's skipped his meds again.

213
00:26:35,490 --> 00:26:38,000
Uncle... you pseudo-uncle!

214
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,170
Please watch who you're talking to before acting up.

215
00:26:40,170 --> 00:26:41,500
Okay.

216
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:45,270
♪ Just beat it, no one wants to be defeated ♪

217
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:48,040
Have a good time.

218
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:51,630
Come on, the state of mind.

219
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:54,330
If we think what's inside the skull is alcohol, it's alcohol;

220
00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:56,800
if we think it's water, it will be water.

221
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:59,390
Meaning, it all depends on how you think.

222
00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:01,420
Bottoms up.

223
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:06,190
♫   No one wants to be defeated   ♫

224
00:27:06,190 --> 00:27:09,130
♫   Showin' how funky and strong is your fight   ♫

225
00:27:09,130 --> 00:27:11,290
Hey, aren't you drinking?

226
00:27:11,290 --> 00:27:13,770
Why are you in mourning?

227
00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:19,960
What's wrong? What's with that unfamiliar expression in front of all this food?

228
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,900
♫   Showin' how funky and strong is your fight   ♫

229
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:24,400
   

230
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:27,390
Just a moment.

231
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:29,350
What's wrong now? Hey!

232
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:33,200
It sounds noisy. Where are you?

233
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,930
What about you?

234
00:27:34,930 --> 00:27:37,540
I'm on my way home.

235
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:39,300
Are you okay? You...

236
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:41,660
I know that you're curious.

237
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:44,450
Go ahead and ask me what you want.

238
00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:47,030
Shall we take a walk?

239
00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:53,180
I decided not to be curious about you at all.

240
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:54,640
 Are you listening? 

241
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,030
Yes, go ahead.

242
00:27:56,030 --> 00:27:59,430
Only think about who you are from this moment on.

243
00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:03,780
To me, who you are from now on is all that matters to me.

244
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:06,370
No matter what anyone says about you, I won't believe it.

245
00:28:06,370 --> 00:28:11,520
And I'm going to get mad at people who tell me something about you I don't know.

246
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:16,330
I'm only going to trust what you tell me.

247
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:18,360
Then I'll hang up now.

248
00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:28,400
Team Leader...

249
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:34,720
Did you run home in the middle of our drinking?!

250
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:37,100
 Hurry up and run back! 

251
00:28:37,970 --> 00:28:40,260
I'm coming, I'm coming.

252
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:54,340
 No matter what anyone says about you, I won't believe it.  

253
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:58,400
 And I'm going to get mad at people who tell me something about you I don't know. 

254
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:02,690
 I'm only going to trust what you tell me. 

255
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:48,450
 I'm only going to trust what you tell me. 

256
00:30:13,650 --> 00:30:15,740
 My valves and my ventricle. 

257
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:18,910
 A person's heart beats 60 or 70 times per minute. 

258
00:30:18,910 --> 00:30:21,830
 In one day, it beats an average of 100,000 times. 

259
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:26,070
 If they live 70 years, their hearts beat up to 2.6 billion times. 

260
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:28,450
 The strength of a heart in one hour 

261
00:30:28,450 --> 00:30:34,310
 is equivalent to the strength required to lift a 75 kg man to the top of a three-story building. 

262
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:39,030
 The heart's failure rate is lower than that of a super-precision machine. 

263
00:30:42,410 --> 00:30:44,240
 Bovie. 

264
00:30:56,360 --> 00:31:02,020
 The weight of a heart is between 350 and 600 grams. The heart's location is...  

265
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:06,860
 The location of the heart, center of the chest at the front. 

266
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:09,900
 A circular conical object between two lungs. 

267
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:15,110
 A small clump of muscle the size of a fist. The heart's purpose is... 

268
00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:19,550
 The heart's sole purpose is to apply pressure like a piston engine. 

269
00:31:19,550 --> 00:31:23,850
 The blood that enters the left atrium after passing through the bicuspid valve from the left ventricle, 

270
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:28,230
 opens the aortic valve from the muscular activity in the left atrium 

271
00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:31,780
 and rushes out into the main artery that streams through the body. 

272
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:38,200
 Human genes are active for 12 hours postmortem. 

273
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:41,830
 The heart keeps beating even in brain death. 

274
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:43,260
 To me, a heart is... 

275
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:45,760
  To me, a heart is a gift.  

276
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:50,360
  To me, a heart is... a machine.
