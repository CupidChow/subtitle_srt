1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:02,100
   

2
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:15,030


3
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:26,240
   

4
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:28,830
   

5
00:00:56,810 --> 00:00:58,760
 Is this Jong Beom? 

6
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:00,510
Yes, Mother...

7
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:10,320
Are you unwell?

8
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,000
You're breaking out in a cold sweat.

9
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,370
It's because I ran here.

10
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:22,090
Of course.

11
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:26,830
Our Jong Beom, since he was young, never got a cold...

12
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:30,060
My son was born with such great genes.

13
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:34,160
In wintertime, I caught a cold just from washing my hair with cold water.

14
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:37,170
And because of a nasal allergy, I always had a runny nose all the time.

15
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,740
Here.

16
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:55,360
You just adore him.

17
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:01,070
I'd be so happy if Jong Woo had even half of his brother's traits.

18
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:07,070
Honey, look at how our son's face is like a sculpture.

19
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:10,930
With skin like marble... And he's just like you when it comes to his good sense of style.

20
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:14,720
You designed all his facial features. I'm not surprised.

21
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:18,640
After this school semester is done,

22
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:23,290
go to your uncle's house in the U.S. And whatever happens, don't ever think about returning here.

23
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:25,810
Just endure over there.

24
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:28,270
And if he goes to America?

25
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:32,970
You must think he won't be your son anymore if you can't see him.

26
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:35,960
That's enough, Dad.

27
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:38,520
He's family, too.

28
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:42,720
Those eyes are not the eyes of someone looking at his brother.

29
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:46,330
Why don't you look at me, Father?

30
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:48,480
Are you scared of me?

31
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:52,060
What?

32
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,810
Jong Beom, go upstairs.

33
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:58,600
Now!

34
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:47,080
Let's talk.

35
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:06,890
Your biological father...

36
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:10,280
had an IQ that's in the top 10% of this country.

37
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:13,650
And I chose him from the top 1% professional jobs among them.

38
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:17,620
He could have been an outstanding doctor or a famous CEO,

39
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:20,900
and he might have been a great judicial officer like your father.

40
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:27,720
Mother... I've never thought of myself as unfortunate,

41
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,040
not someone who was thrown away,

42
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,150
but I was chosen with sperm donation.

43
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,890
I'm giving thanks to Father right now, too.

44
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:42,740
He was the one who raised me.

45
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:48,370
You had never learned art.

46
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:51,550
But you drew that picture of a landscape filled with snow when you were four years old.

47
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,790
You drew that painting as soon as you woke up one day.

48
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:02,370
For me,

49
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:06,050
I'm really happy to have you.

50
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:09,360
Even though you stay still, light beams out of you.

51
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:16,750
Since you were young, you've been the best at studying, drawing, exercise, and music.

52
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,640
I never brought you a tutor.

53
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,820
You even chose which medical school to attend.

54
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,680
Even though you liked drawing so much, you still went to medical school. Right?

55
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:28,320
You know how to become a person to be envied.

56
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:33,300
In this world, the 1% elite like you

57
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:37,270
leads the 99% thick-headed majority, Jong Beom.

58
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:42,930
Don't buy a car yet.

59
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:45,220
Even though it's my present to you?

60
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:47,540
I don't need a car,

61
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:51,710
but allow me to live near my school.

62
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:56,540
Is this house uncomfortable for you?

63
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:57,820
Do you want to leave this house?

64
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:00,050
If I stay in this house,

65
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,960
is it comfortable for you?

66
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:08,380
Listen to me carefully, Jong Beom.

67
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:11,210
The one and only reason for you to leave this house

68
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:13,780
is if I throw you out.

69
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:23,630
I won't throw you out even if you were to murder someone.

70
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:26,040
But...

71
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:30,340
Don't lag behind.

72
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:33,110
If you make a foolish mistake,

73
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:36,640
I'll have no choice but to throw you out.

74
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:21,020
 Unbelievable incident! Today a young man's mummy was found in Gangwon Province. 

75
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:22,630
 I heard they put the body into formaldehyde! 

76
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:25,240
 It was discovered during an on-scene investigation for Byeon Seong Hoon. 

77
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,920
 I thought that guy only killed women. 

78
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:29,000
 But the bastard went around killing at random! 

79
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,550
 I heard that Byeon Seong Hoon might not have killed him! 

80
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:33,810
 That guy died holding a book called "Wuthering Heights!" 

81
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:36,550
 Is that by any chance a dying message?!! 

82
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:38,990
 Who would die holding a book?! 

83
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:42,230
 It's the murderer's marker, you dummy! 

84
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:45,930
It seems your warmth still remains.

85
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:50,920
After living in the water for 30 years, isn't it great to see the world's light again?

86
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:55,470
Since we've cut the ropes off, you'll be able to rest comfortably today.

87
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:17,410
What was your name?

88
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:23,120
Your age is similar to mine, but you've shown me too much already even though we've just met!

89
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:28,250
I don't know what happened 30 years ago,

90
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:30,850
but you were murdered on the happiest day.

91
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:34,280
That's why you couldn't decay, right?

92
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:39,070
You bought a wedding ring to put onto your lover's finger,

93
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:41,280
and on your way to see her,

94
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:44,350
you died before you met her.

95
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:47,040
Is that right?

96
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,060
That's what happened...

97
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:29,790
Lee Bo So, will you trust me?

98
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:33,330
I'll find your identity for you.

99
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:38,080
And I'll find your bride.

100
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,570
If your bride is alive,

101
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:46,390
I'll find that woman and relay that ring to her.

102
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:49,300
You couldn't give that ring to her,

103
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:52,300
so you're still in this state.

104
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:59,420
But if your bride receives your ring,

105
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:01,040
then...

106
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:05,960
you can go in peace.

107
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:35,950
 Hyeong Bin! 

108
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:37,930
 Hyeong Bin! 

109
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:42,620
 Hyeong Bin! 

110
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:46,120
 Hyeong Bin! 

111
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,600
Did you have a nightmare again?

112
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:08,550
Get some more sleep.

113
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:16,360
I really don't like this.

114
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:20,640
- What? 
 - The fact that you got out of bed before me.

115
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,120
You're always like that...

116
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:24,200
Aren't we in a relationship where we will use the same bed together forever?

117
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:30,000
I don't like your tone either.  Even though we're already engaged, why does it seem you're not mine?

118
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,650
Didn't you like me in the first place because I wasn't yours?

119
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:35,830
I thought men obsessed with work were also obsessed with their women.

120
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:41,540
Those who fall deeply into something and go crazy are weak.

121
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:44,510
Why would you hand over their control keys to someone else?

122
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:54,490
Sorry, take everything in the refrigerator, they're all your favorite foods.

123
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:57,050
I bought you a necktie pin.

124
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:59,570
Why are you always carrying a fountain pen?

125
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,720
   

126
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:18,170
  
  

127
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:27,230
Don't let the Donggang investigation get leaked out.

128
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:31,050
Who was the person that was informed of the investigation? Please make sure she keeps it under wraps, too.

129
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:34,510
It's too late, Prosecutor. The remains became a skeleton overnight.

130
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:35,850
I don't know how the reporters found out,

131
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:38,390
 but they're all stationed in front of the National Forensic Research Institute. 

132
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:40,290
I'll be right there.

133
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,620
- Yes? 
 - Hello, Prosecutor.

134
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:53,420
- I'm Seong Hoon.  
 - Seong Hoon?

135
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:57,310
I guess you forgot my name. I'm Byeon Seong Hoon.

136
00:12:57,310 --> 00:13:00,840
- Can you get the jerk on the phone who let you use the cell phone? 
 - Why?

137
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:04,290
I'm the one who wanted to talk to you.

138
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:07,050
- Really? Then I'll come to you. 
 - No, thanks.

139
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:11,260
- No, thanks? 
 - It's amazing. There's a reporter who believes me.

140
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:13,690
 I heard it all during the on-scene investigation. 

141
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:15,690
That the skeletal remains are 30 years old.

142
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:17,690
You know, that mummy.

143
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:22,260
Prosecutor, you're trying to lie by saying I killed that person. Right?

144
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:28,230
Ridiculous. Do you still think that I'm a serial killer?

145
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:32,560
Why? Because I was a juvenile delinquent?

146
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:36,300
I only killed one person!

147
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:39,810
 Because you keep carrying out forced investigations on me, 

148
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:42,920
it's making me give false confessions!

149
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:45,930
That I killed more than 10 people!

150
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:55,630
And your phone number...

151
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:59,570
This person next to me told me.

152
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:05,730
This person here knew your phone number and address.

153
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:11,600
I feel like you won't be able to live out your proper lifespan.

154
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,840
I'll see you at the court trial, Prosecutor.

155
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,760
Bye.

156
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:39,870
Warden Ahn, please check cell phone smuggling routes for your prisoners right away.

157
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:43,870
Focus on the punks who get medications prescribed from outside, not through the mail.

158
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:46,670
Whoever you find, send them over to me.

159
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:51,820
Playing?

160
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:55,560
Fine, I'll play along with you.

161
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:31,260
Is it possible for it to become skeletal? Or is there another reason?

162
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:34,550
Please move aside. Please.

163
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:54,410
Is it scientifically possible for a corpse to become a skeleton overnight?

164
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:56,920
Is there any possibility that the NFS made a mistake and switched the remains?

165
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:59,740
Has there ever been a similar case when remains become a skeleton?

166
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:03,110
Does that corpse belong to the victim that Byeon Seong Hoon killed?

167
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:05,220
Byeon Seong Hoon is...

168
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:12,420
We will give a statement after doing a detailed autopsy.

169
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:37,930
 I think you can come in right now, Prosecutor. 

170
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:41,640
Look!  That corpse isn't cold. That's not a living person,

171
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:44,280
What do you want for your snack?

172
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:08,340
Male, height of about 184 centimeters, and weight of about 75 kg.

173
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:10,570
He had a robust physique.

174
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:16,940
Looking at the condition of development, the bones' age is that of someone in his late-20s.

175
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:20,200
Time of death looks to be about 30 to 35 years ago.

176
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:24,180
 Estimated to be between 1984 and 1989. 

177
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:30,480
At the time of discovery, the wound in the chest was found in the shape of an upside-down cross.

178
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,130
 And two unskilled cuts in the abdomen. 

179
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:38,920
But the fatal injuries look to be from the wounds to the abdomen.

180
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:43,850
 The knife wound in the chest looks to be symbolic. It could be the killer's signature. 

181
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:49,020
The knife penetrated the ribs and went all the way to the spine.

182
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:53,670
How can you stab a knife into a person's body like this?

183
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:57,140
The left side of the face has been shattered with a heavy blunt object.

184
00:18:57,140 --> 00:19:00,640
 Everything from the cheekbones to the jaw has been completely shattered. 

185
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:04,460
From that force, the skull has also been shattered.

186
00:19:13,370 --> 00:19:15,980
Listen, Lee Bo So.

187
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:22,230
 What on earth happened 30 years ago? 

188
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:35,140
Tell me what happened.

189
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:39,600
Did you say hello to Prosecutor Kim Soo Hyeok?

190
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,560
He went into the observation room.

191
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:46,060
- He did?
- Did he leave?

192
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:28,720
 What on earth happened 30 years ago? 

193
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,870
This is really incredible!

194
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:50,210
Let's go.

195
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:02,060
   

196
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:08,620
   

197
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:20,470
The corpse which was found in Papyeong by the Royal Yoon family is called the Naju Donation Mummy.

198
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:24,770
It is said that the skin was elastic, as though it would rebound if pressed.

199
00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:27,970
Like this, as long as the skeleton and the cartilaginous tissue exist,

200
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:31,980
we can fully determine the cause of death.

201
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:33,500
What was the cause of death?

202
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:37,430
When the remains were discovered, the noblewoman's stomach was protruding.

203
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:41,060
The CT scan and MRI results showed that the noblewoman's uterus had ruptured,

204
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:44,240
and the baby's head was at the vaginal opening.

205
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,850
She died while giving birth.

206
00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:48,950
Why did her body not rot?

207
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:50,900
Lime was strewn outside the tomb.

208
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:54,660
The lime hardened like cement and prevented the body from decaying.

209
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:57,640
Then how long did it take for the Papyeong Yoon to become skeletal?

210
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:01,940
Even before it became skeletal, she became an uninvited guest in the anatomy room of a medical school.

211
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:04,650
There is no mummy conservation management law in our country yet.

212
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:10,770
Is it medically possible to explain how a corpse became a skeleton overnight after excavation like the one found in Donggang?

213
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:15,680
I guess you have a lot of interest in that case.

214
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:19,030
I'll invite those of you who are interested in the National Forensic Service practice to the autopsy room.

215
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:22,450
If you intern three times, you'll have an opportunity to be selected as an assistant.

216
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:25,430
But please be respectful toward the remains.

217
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:28,400
I reject any simple curiosity.

218
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:41,700
When can I come to the autopsy room?

219
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:44,350
Your face is like that of someone being set up to go on a date.

220
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:46,960
The NFS autopsy process differs from anatomical dissection.

221
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:52,420
They're mostly people who have died an untimely death. You need appropriate intent and condolence.

222
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:55,550
Okay. I will have that.

223
00:22:55,550 --> 00:22:58,660
I don't believe in an afterlife, but I do believe in near-death experiences.

224
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:04,110
I've heard that people who are about to die, they see their whole life pass before their eyes.

225
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:09,070
And then after that, they see a world that's like a hallucination.

226
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:12,280
You said you don't believe in an afterlife.

227
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:17,310
People are organisms, so I'm sure one day there will be a medical explanation.

228
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:23,300
But... there's an X-file in my life which can't be explained medically either.

229
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:25,400
X-file?

230
00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:31,740
I never learned to draw, but since the age of four, I've been able to draw pictures worthy of being shown in galleries.

231
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:33,580
And only certain types of pictures at that.

232
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:35,270
What kind of pictures are they?

233
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:40,560
A village where snow falls, a grove of birch trees, snowy landscape.

234
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:44,330
You're trying to tell me in a roundabout way that you're a genius, right?

235
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:47,330
When can I come to the autopsy for the Donggang mummy?

236
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:52,200
Is your dream really to become a forensic scientist?

237
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,140
Yes.

238
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:58,970
Fine. Then call me in front of the NFS at 2:00 tomorrow.

239
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:26,600
 Sorry for your loss. 

240
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:29,080
 Thank you for coming. 

241
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:31,260
 Please head over that way. 

242
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:35,740
 Jong Beom, you're so brave. 

243
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:52,530
 Grandpa loved you so much. 

244
00:24:52,530 --> 00:24:55,380
 Aren't you sad at all? 

245
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:03,950
 He's in shock. Why are you saying that? 

246
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:09,870
 Jong Beom, let's go outside. 

247
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:15,080
 Let's go. 

248
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:17,670
  - That kid isn't even crying. 
- I know! 

249
00:25:17,670 --> 00:25:20,010
  Maybe it's because he's young. 

250
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:34,280
  Tell me, Jong Beom, the thoughts you're having right now. 

251
00:25:36,550 --> 00:25:40,960
 The dog that died in front of our house before, 

252
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,740
 you didn't say you felt bad for it. 

253
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:48,830
 Your first words were that you wanted to try and dissect it. 

254
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:52,990
 You want to know more about your grandpa's body, too, don't you? 

255
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:56,540
 I'm your mom, so you can tell me the truth. 

256
00:25:56,540 --> 00:26:00,030
 You're curious about the inside of a body, right? 

257
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:01,360
 No. 

258
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:06,220
 Wanting to dissect isn't a bad impulse. 

259
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:11,050
 It's because you're a genius. 

260
00:26:11,050 --> 00:26:15,350
 Do you know what a genius is? 

261
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:20,710
 You've received the DNA of the top 1%. 

262
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:25,960
 My son is different as expected. 

263
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:31,710
 Other kids at your age can't do anything but sob at funerals. 

264
00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:33,890
 I'm curious. 

265
00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:37,390
 Right. Right. It's fine. 

266
00:26:37,390 --> 00:26:40,320
 Grandpa was a pastor. 

267
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:43,190
 If there is such a thing as a soul, 

268
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:46,120
 if he will come back to life, 

269
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:49,810
 and if he does, what he will look like. 

270
00:26:49,810 --> 00:26:51,390
 What? 

271
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:08,570
   

272
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:30,050
A book where a mummy bound with red ropes came back to life.

273
00:27:44,410 --> 00:27:45,430
Hello?

274
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:49,020
 I'm on my way. I think I'll be there at NFS in 10 minutes. 

275
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:51,520
Okay, I'm coming out now.

276
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:27,650
What's going on?

277
00:28:34,390 --> 00:28:36,080
What?

278
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:29,060


279
00:29:34,890 --> 00:29:37,210
 Everyone has their own fated time. 

280
00:29:37,210 --> 00:29:40,960
 When that time comes, someone will discover me, 

281
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:45,360
 and I will discover that someone. 

282
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:51,520
♫   Will a leaf fall from exhaustion   ♫

283
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:57,690
♫   At the endless chirping of birds through the night?   ♫

284
00:29:57,690 --> 00:30:03,780
♫   It will still bloom even if you're far away?   ♫

285
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:05,140
   

286
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:08,310
 Haven't we seen each other somewhere before? 

287
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:11,700
 Even if we live in another time, we can communicate with each other. 

288
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:15,310
 A copycat has appeared. It's Gong Ji Cheol's marker. 

289
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:18,510
 Director Cheon Seok Tae will gnash his teeth over anything to do with Gong Ji Cheol. 

290
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:20,900
 The person you hate the most. 

291
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:23,140
 I heard a medical school student has been coming by. 

292
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:26,320
 - There's a witness. 
 - So you're digging into my background now? 

293
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,070
 I got something conclusive. 

294
00:30:28,070 --> 00:30:31,250
 Do you want to hurt someone who's alive because of a dead person?
