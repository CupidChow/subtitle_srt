Jeong Ha Eun... I have...

4
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:35,990
engraved her... in here.

5
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:40,560
 If I'm reborn, Jeong Sa Bin, 

6
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:44,070
 I want to be born as her heart. 

7
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:47,100
 I want to become a heart and beat inside her, 

8
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:51,110
 and live together and die together, 

9
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:54,480
 and become an eternal memory.

Jong Beom.

15
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:47,580
Do you remember telling me that a heart also has memory cells?

16
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:51,710
What do you think that my heart remembers?

17
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:54,870
Ever since the first moment I saw you,

18
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:56,240
I felt pain in my heart.

19

♫   just like your dreams   ♫

23
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:25,180
My hands trembled and my heart hurt,

24
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:28,180
so that's how I knew.

25
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:33,330
That every cell in my body recognizes you.

26
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:45,490
I wish... I had two hearts.

27
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:54,410
At first, when I saw Prosecutor Kim, my heart started beating and fluttering,

28
00:02:54,410 --> 00:03:01,610
but now, my heart... aches and hurts when I see you.

29
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:08,880
It seems like what's right for now is to care for you

30
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:12,640
who makes my heart ache.

31
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:19,160
But I might go back to him someday.

32
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:22,030
Even though he made a wrong decision,

33
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:27,510
my heart remembers him.

34
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:32,900
I can just wait. I'm good at waiting.

35
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:37,370
Even yesterday, I waited at the rooftop until dawn.

36
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:39,060
Sorry. Yesterday, I...

37
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:44,850
Since you're by my side now... I'll only think about that.

38
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:50,950
And day by day I'm going to... make it so that your heart remembers me first.

39
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:54,020
Just wait and see.

44

00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:24,050
  Two street lights on the hill to your house aren't working.  

53
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:26,120
  Be careful...  

54
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:49,970
 Since I was 17, I've been called a genius and put on exhibitions. 

55
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:52,940
 All my life I've never stopped creating. 

56
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:56,220
 Do you think they were the only ones I killed? 

57
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:03,680
  The only one I killed... was Yoon Jeong Hee.  

58
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:20,220
What is it?

59
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:22,910
I have something to ask you.

60
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:27,350
If you're not a serial killer, then why did you kill Yoon Jeong Hee?

61
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:33,250
Yoon Jeong Hee. She killed the only child I was friends with in my neighborhood.

62
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:39,110
Because she didn't give birth to him. I thought bad people like that

63
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:43,040
deserved punishment.

64
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:49,350
If, in return for her death, I could save someone I loved.

65
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,780
Even though now I regret how foolish that thought was.

66
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:58,270
Who did you love that you tried to save?

67
00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:01,990
Someone I loved so much that I could even give them my heart...

68
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,000
Jeong Ha Eun.

69
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,050
Jeong Ha Eun?

70
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:13,200
You're saying you killed someone for your love?

71
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,530
Still, do you think that can be justified?

72
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:18,500
How are you different from Gong Ji Cheol?

73
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:23,160
You also shot me in the head because of your love for Jeong Sa Bin.

74
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,430
Even though you knew I'd die.

75
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:29,730
Isn't that so?

76
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:35,130
If you want to save Jeong Sa Bin properly, this time Gong In Woo and Baek Sang Ah...

77
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:36,920
Make sure to catch them.

78
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:40,330
Setting Baek Sang Ah aside, why Gong In Woo?

79
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:44,180
Baek Sang Ah is Gong In Woo's daughter.

80
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:49,840
Gong In Woo... he won't just stand by and watch.

81
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:14,810
   

82
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:18,350
     

83
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:19,370
What is it?

84
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:21,800
 Prosecutor Kim is digging into the Gong Ji Cheol case. 

85
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:25,830
 He even applied to inspect the closed files related to the case. 

86
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:32,100
I got it. Report everything that Kim Soo Hyeok does from now on, without leaving anything out.

87
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:38,910
   

88
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:49,850
Yes, it's me... Come see me in my office for a moment.

89
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:55,550
Come in.

90
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:10,830
You must be busy preparing for the hearing. What is it at this hour?

91
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:18,620
I heard you even went to the Government Data Archive to dig into the Gong Ji Cheol files.

92
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:26,920
While investigating Gong Ji Cheol's copycat crimes, I couldn't avoid going back 32 years.

93
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:32,730
But after taking a look at the crime files, I came to the conclusion that Gong Ji Cheol might not have been the culprit.

94
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:35,780
No. I'm certain of it.

95
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:38,950
Let's say the real culprit is someone else. What are you going to do by arresting that person?

96
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:43,470
What can you do with a culprit whose statute of limitations has long ago expired? Put them on trial?

97
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:46,830
If that person committed serial murders 32 years ago,

98
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:51,510
he or she would have continued killing after that, too.

99
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:58,660
Kim Soo Hyeok! I told you not to touch Gong Ji Cheol's case files anymore!

100
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:08,740
Soo Hyeok, when you became a prosecutor and came to introduce yourself the very first time,

101
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:13,040
I told you that you had a lot of work to do here at the Prosecutors Office, didn't I?

102
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:19,100
You need to see that work through to the end, don't you think?

103
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:29,030
The work I need to see through to the end... is Gong Ji Cheol's case.

104
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,260
You know the Prosecutor General's hearing is soon, don't you?

105
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:55,570
So?

106
00:10:55,570 --> 00:11:00,640
What changes if you become the Prosecutor General?

107
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:04,270
If I do well, it will make Sang Ah more comfortable, don't you think?

108
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:06,750
I've taken care of Sang Ah's trial for the time being.

109
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:12,660
I've set up the prosecutor in charge and have blocked the NFS and the media.

110
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:15,250
Then, isn't it all done?

111
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:18,210
But...

112
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:24,710
I don't know what Kim Soo Hyeok senses, but he's been digging into Gong Ji Cheol.

113
00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:28,930
It won't be good for us if Gong Ji Cheol's case comes to light.

114
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:35,490
Kim Soo Hyeok... You take care of him.

115
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:42,960
I had a debt to pay anyway.

116
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:46,140
It worked out well.

117
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:53,350
     

118
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:55,680
It's not bad news.

119
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,350
     

120
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:02,100
It's a three-hour performance that starts at 4:30.

121
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:06,160
I confirmed you going into the performance before it started on the security camera.

122
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:11,530
Doo Cheol died at six, so the timeline doesn't match up. It's possible to prove your innocence.

123
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,750
I did it on purpose.

124
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:22,940
Since you never know.

125
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:30,880
You told me yourself that psychopaths make elaborate plans in advance.

126
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:37,920
But killing Gang Doo Cheol that day was on impulse.

127
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:42,160
I didn't think I could feel better that day if I didn't kill someone.

128
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,750
     

129
00:12:54,290 --> 00:13:00,580
Listen up well... I will do everything I can for you.

130
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:03,590
Is it really for me?

131
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:05,260
Isn't it for you?

132
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:07,460
Sang Ah, you...

133
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:11,080
I killed Im Hwa Yeong and Kim Hee Soo, too.

134
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:15,350
Why? Are you starting to take an interest in me now?

135
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:18,390
You only take interest in murderers.

136
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:22,020
That's why you were interested in Cheon Jong Beom, too.

137
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:25,440
You were happy that he would soon become a murderer.

138
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:30,100
Which made me think he would understand me, so I wanted to be friends with him.

139
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:37,730
But it turns out there is someone who understands me. A truly real person.

140
00:13:39,530 --> 00:13:42,220
That's why I went to the cabin.

141
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:46,670
So... who did you meet at the cabin?

142
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:49,120
The person that you met...

143
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:54,670
My dad... Gong In Woo.

144
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:59,620
You... How did you...

145
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:03,560
Tell him to come to my trial. I have a request to make.

146
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:05,430
Sang Ah.

147
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:09,000
Gong In Woo isn't someone you can manage—

148
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:14,400
Mom, I choose who's going to help me.

149
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:23,380
Oh, Prosecutor, about the murder case in Gapyeong.

150
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:25,600
I just got a call from NFS,

151
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:31,520
and the bit of flesh that we assumed would be found under the victim's nail

152
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:34,200
seems to have been swept away by the current.

153
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:40,660
If we just had that, we could have obtained the DNA and arrested the suspect! It would have been crucial evidence!

154
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:42,940
It was swept away?

155
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:45,370
Didn't Professor Yoo Seo Yeong carry out Gang Do Cheol's autopsy?

156
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:49,960
Prosecutor Cheon assigned someone else to do the autopsy.

157
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:50,980
What?

158
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:54,900
Baek Sang Ah's hearing is in two days. Will you be okay?

159
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:57,610
People are really talking.

160
00:14:57,610 --> 00:15:03,530
The defendant is your ex-fiancée and the lawyer is your mother-in-law. Like some soap opera.

161
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:06,490
Hey! Joo In Do!

162
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:08,250
Yes, Detective Cha?

163
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:14,680
Oh! That's right... My mind keeps going back and forth...

164
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,180
It must be the side effects of the surgery.

165
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:20,580
Be on alert and look into every one of Baek Sang Ah's visitors.

166
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:23,240
Yes, Sir. I understand.

167
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:28,150
This is an extreme job I have...

168
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:30,540
     

169
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:35,020
 On April 12th of last year, Detective Joo In Do, who was investigating the Yellow Umbrella serial killer, 

170
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:39,070
 picked up the fact that the UV tattoo ink, which was a piece of crucial evidence in the Pureun Apartment Building Im Hwa Yeong case, 

171
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:42,870
 was bought in Gang Do Cheol's name by defendant Baek Sang Ah. 

172
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:49,320
When the defendant found out, she attempted to kill Detective Joo In Do by luring him to Yuhon Gallery.

173
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:56,900
What was your reason for going to Yuhon Gallery on April 12th of last year?

174
00:15:56,900 --> 00:16:02,830
I found a special ink on the neck of the victim Im Hwa Yeong.

175
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:07,890
I was tracking the person who bought that ink and found out that Gang Do Cheol had bought it.

176
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:11,540
When I called, a woman answered.

177
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:18,200
She asked to meet around 9:00 that night at Yuhon Gallery and I was...

178
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,330
Who was that?

179
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,870
It was that woman.

180
00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:28,070
How can you be sure?

181
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:30,370
I'm a seasoned detective of over 30 years.

182
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:34,440
And I saw a butterfly tattoo on her neck.

183
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:44,030
I submit the photo of the defendant Baek Sang Ah on the screen as exhibit 27.

184
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:46,220
The weapon that the defendant used, was it a knife?

185
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:48,480
No, it wasn't a knife.

186
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:53,010
It was a yellow umbrella with a sharp point that looked like a spear.

187
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:58,560
It looked just like the yellow umbrellas used in the serial murder cases.

188
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:03,350
The suspect who stabbed you, was it Ms. Baek Sang Ah?

189
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:09,000
Yes, it was. I definitely remember the defendant's face.

190
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,370
That is all.

191
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:14,860
Counsel, you may cross examine.

192
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:26,370
You said the gallery that night was dark and there was thunder.

193
00:17:26,370 --> 00:17:27,970
Yes.

194
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:37,400
Detective Joo In Do, which of these do you think is the woman in that video clip?

195
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:41,390
Why don't you try finding her with your seasoned detective skills of 30 years?

196
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:10,220
The woman in that video clip is not this person.

197
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:15,920
It's this person.

198
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:23,080
During that time, Detective Joo In Do was in severe shock and stress.

199
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:26,590
His memory was distorted by the stress and the passion to catch the culprit.

200
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:31,720
No! I definitely saw the butterfly tattoo on that woman's neck!

201
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:36,270
There are endless numbers of women with similar tattoos on their collarbones.

202
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:44,110
It could have been any one of those women, so why did you specifically identify Baek Sang Ah as the suspect?

203
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:50,280
If falsely accusing an innocent person as the suspect is the result of being a seasoned detective of 30 years, I'm speechless.

204
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:55,770
Detective Joo In Do, you may step down.

205
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:04,880
On May 20th, at the cabin near Gapyeong,

206
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:09,260
the defendant used a muscle paralytic on the victim and killed him by drowning him in the lake.

207
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:13,700
Therefore, under to Articles 25 and 205 of the Criminal Code, I charge defendant Baek Sang Ah

208
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:16,360
with attempted murder and murder.

209
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:20,110
Counsel, do you acknowledge the crime?

210
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:25,150
No. I deny all the allegations of the indictment.

211
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:27,010
The defendant pleads not guilty.

212
00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:29,620
We have analytic data from the NFS confirming that defendant Baek Sang Ah's DNA was obtained

213
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:33,420
from the string bracelet that victim Gang Do Cheol was clutching.

214
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:39,550
The defendant had already testified that she lost her bracelet before the murder of the victim, Gang Doo Cheol.

215
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:44,220
There is no evidence to confirm that the defendant lost it. It's only a circumstantial statement.

216
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:48,410
 This is a security camera recording from a concert hall in Seoul on May 20th. 

217
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:53,690
 On the day of the murder, Baek Sang Ah attended the performance. 

218
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:57,790
 The NFS estimated that the victim died at 6:00 p.m. 

219
00:19:57,790 --> 00:20:02,820
 But the performance started at 4:30 and ended at 7:30. 

220
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:07,130
There are plenty of possibilities that the defendant left the hall after the performance began.

221
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:10,740
Do you have proof that she left the performance?

222
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:14,360
How can there be better evidence than the DNA obtained from the bracelet

223
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:17,800
that the victim Gang Doo Cheol was clutching?

224
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:25,610
 You have 15 minutes to make your argument. 

225
00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:28,900
 Prosecutor and counsel, please step forward. 

226
00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:35,460
Wait.

227
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:45,530
You said you had crucial evidence that Baek Sang Ah was the culprit.

228
00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:46,310
And?

229
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:48,730
We have to catch Sang Ah in order to catch Gong In Woo,

230
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:51,820
and we can also clear your name, Gong Ji Cheol.

231
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:56,690
Cheon Seok Tae, Jang Hye Mi, Gong In Woo, Baek Sang Ah.

232
00:20:56,690 --> 00:20:59,660
They're not people you can deal with.

233
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:02,970
They're diseased in the head as you said.

234
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:06,050
I've dealt with plenty of people like that already.

235
00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:09,390
This time trust me and leave the evidence in my care.

236
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:11,220
If I give it to you, I'm sure it'll take care of Baek Sang Ah.

237
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:15,630
but... Baek Sang Ah is not the only problem now.

238
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:18,380
- What? 
 - Jeong Sa Bin...

239
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:20,750
Until her safety is confirmed,

240
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:26,730
you deal with Baek Sang Ah your way, and I'll do it my way.

241
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:32,760
Why are you dragging Jeong Sa Bin into this trial now?

242
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:36,340
I didn't drag her in.

243
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:41,690
The more you corner her, the more you endanger Jeong Sa Bin, not yourself.

244
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:44,530
Do you still not know?

245
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:01,480
     
   There's somewhere I want to go with you.  

246
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,820
  Where's that? 

247
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:21,760
This was the place you wanted to come?

248
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:25,460
I realized that it's the first time I've gone to a movie theater.

249
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:27,590
I am just too much.

250
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,800
I've spent all my 32 years only going between the lecture hall, NFS,

251
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:33,190
and my dad's nursing hospital.

252
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:34,750
It's my first time, too.

253
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:37,060
Really? That's good, then.

254
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:40,390
Shall we have our first experience at a movie theater?

255
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:42,010
Sure.

256
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:47,960
 Bye. 

257
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:56,580
  Thanks for everything, but don't ever come back. 

258
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,730
   

259
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:23,920
 You're already... an animal. 

260
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:26,580
♫   Your eyes looking at me  ♫

261
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:32,060
♫   somehow look sad  ♫

262
00:23:34,610 --> 00:23:40,200
♫   When I look at you, the whole world  ♫

263
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:46,260
♫   seems to have stopped while filled with you  ♫

264
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:55,290
♫   Even if someday a difficult time comes for us  ♫

265
00:23:55,290 --> 00:24:00,020
♫   I will not leave  ♫

266
00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:06,640
♫   Even if the warm wind carries me away  ♫

267
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:10,200
♫   You're my one and only love  ♫

268
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:14,570
♫   Don't let go of my hand  ♫

269
00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:19,940
♫   My dear, even if we don't say anything  ♫

270
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:23,530
♫   Even if I'm just looking at you  ♫

271
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:28,940
♫   You're the one I want to see  ♫

272
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:27,100
Jong Beom.

273
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:29,000
What shall we do now?

274
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,800
Are you okay?

275
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:33,610
It's a cold, I took some medicine.

276
00:25:33,610 --> 00:25:37,750
You should tell me if you're sick. Don't just deal with it.

277
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:42,080
When I'm with you, I don't feel sick even if I am.

278
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:46,600
Lady Sa Bin, what have you done to me?

279
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:49,810
What's with you? You're trying to embarrass me.

280
00:25:49,810 --> 00:25:52,820
What should we do now? I'm hungry.

281
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:55,300
     

282
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:57,630
There's still so much time left until we get to go home.

283
00:25:57,630 --> 00:26:00,520
Don't you think you're working too hard, young lady?

284
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:04,730
Young lady, you're talking about yourself.

285
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:06,480
Seriously, what are you doing?

286
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:13,330
Professor Yoo said we can't identify the remains of the convict, so I'm looking for other means.

287
00:26:13,330 --> 00:26:15,760
Oh, you're so obsessed with the remains.

288
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:22,190
But these remains are not some state secret. Even if he's unidentifiable,

289
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:24,950
I don't understand why we're being told to close the case this quickly.

290
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:29,830
Don't we have to keep the remains during the legal notice period?

291
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:36,030
I know. Why is someone waaay up top telling us to cremate him right away?

292
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:38,760
Do you think maybe he's a spy?

293
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:43,670
A North Korean spy fell in love with a daughter from a high-ranking family in South Korea and was sent to jail,

294
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:45,690
but he couldn't forget that love and escaped!

295
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:48,290
Then he got stabbed in the ocean and...

296
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:51,010
- Dead. 
 - Hey!

297
00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:54,980
Must you act up like that in front of remains with such special circumstances?

298
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:02,990
I'm thinking about finding his identity from the families of the missing persons' remains project.

299
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:06,410
They have blood samples from the bereaved of the missing from three years ago until now.

300
00:27:06,410 --> 00:27:10,910
But this looks to be older than 30 years. Can we find it before he's cremated?

301
00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:13,620
And on top of that, he's a convict.

302
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:14,890
Convict?

303
00:27:14,890 --> 00:27:19,450
That's right! Dad's gotten better these days, and if it's 30 years ago...

304
00:27:19,450 --> 00:27:21,700
Maybe my dad would know!

305
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:23,660
Hey, hey, hey!

306
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:40,180
 But why did he die out in the ocean as a convict? 

307
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:44,860
 Because he had to meet the woman he loved. 

308
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:53,990
 If he could just see her again, he would have put his life on the line no matter how many times. 

309
00:27:57,730 --> 00:28:05,700
 That convict, while dying, I'm sure he fought to live. 

310
00:28:07,410 --> 00:28:12,860
 Because he didn't get to tell her he loved her. 

311
00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:27,170
 Please give me... a little time. 

312
00:28:27,170 --> 00:28:29,390
  No!  

313
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:42,500
Why is my dad in such a good mood today?

314
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:45,020
You're here, Sa Bin.

315
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:48,430
You recognize me today?

316
00:28:52,150 --> 00:28:52,990
     

317
00:28:52,990 --> 00:28:56,860
Dad, you're doing well with the art therapy, right?

318
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:00,640
Of course, I am.

319
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:04,450
But... what about Prosecutor Kim Soo Hyeok?

320
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:07,030
He didn't come with you?

321
00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:09,440
- Mr. Kim Soo Hyeok? 
 - Yeah.

322
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:15,050
Why didn't you bring him with you? I miss him.

323
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:18,710
Oh right! I have something to ask you.

324
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:20,200
Yeah?

325
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:24,750
A convict's remains from 30 years ago were found near the shore not too long ago.

326
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:26,660
He even had his inmate number.

327
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:28,190
Convict?

328
00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:30,820
Will you have a look?

329
00:29:33,010 --> 00:29:34,560
Here.

330
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:45,300
What...

331
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,450
What was the number?

332
00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:49,420
What?

333
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:52,610
What number is this convict wearing?

334
00:29:52,610 --> 00:29:55,840
In-Inmate number.

335
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,020
3711.

336
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:58,960
Gong Ji Cheol!

337
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,090
Gong Ji Cheol! Gong Ji Cheol!

338
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:03,350
Gong Ji Cheol! Gong Ji Cheol!

339
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:04,690
- Gong Ji Cheol! Ah! 
 - Dad!

340
00:30:04,690 --> 00:30:06,350
Gong Ji Cheol! Gong Ji Cheol!

341
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:07,420
Dad.

342
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:10,370
It's him. It's Gong Ji Cheol.

343
00:30:10,370 --> 00:30:12,140
Please save me, save me!

344
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:13,970
Gong Ji Cheol is dead.

345
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:16,550
It's okay now. I said it's okay now.

346
00:30:16,550 --> 00:30:18,200
No!

347
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:21,430
Help us over here! Over here!

348
00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:23,200
Gong Ji Cheol. Gong Ji Cheol.

349
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,300
Please save me.

350
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:27,400
What's the matter?

351
00:30:29,430 --> 00:30:31,510
Kim Soo Hyeok.

352
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,300
Excuse me!

353
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:39,230
Miss, he's calm now,

354
00:30:39,230 --> 00:30:41,560
so we'll take good care of him.

355
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:46,160
Visiting hours are over, so I think you can go home.

356
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,880
Okay.

357
00:30:59,070 --> 00:31:03,110
He was better for a while. Because of me...

358
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:04,890
He'll get better soon.

359
00:31:04,890 --> 00:31:08,960
But what happened?

360
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:12,160
The convict's remains that were found recently by the shore,

361
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:15,850
my dad said it was Gong Ji Cheol.

362
00:31:15,850 --> 00:31:17,130
Gong Ji Cheol?

363
00:31:17,130 --> 00:31:21,470
I wondered what happened to him that he was found near the shore.

364
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:25,630
So I wanted to find his family for him,

365
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:30,180
but those remains were Gong Ji Cheol's...

366
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:35,730
 Gong Ji Cheol, why did he die by the ocean? 

367
00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:40,500
 What happened after I died?
