1
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:08,950
   

2
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:29,780
Why is he outside in this cold?

3
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:36,420
Jong Beom.

4
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:43,720
- Take responsibility. 
 - For what?

5
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:46,210
- Me. 
 - You?

6
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:48,370
Take responsibility for me catching a cold.

7
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:51,260
Seriously!

8
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:55,460
Oh, it's cold.

9
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:01,710
Did Prosecutor Kim buy you that watch?

10
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:04,190
Oh, this?

11
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:09,240
I'll do the rest. Give the pots to the uncles.

12
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,940
I'll do that then.

13
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:21,970
You don't want it getting wet.

14
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,060
Sorry. What do I do?

15
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:30,130
It's okay. It's fine.

16
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:32,800
It's new. I'm sure it won't break that easily.

17
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:48,070
Detective Joo In Do's cell phone memory chip was badly damaged, so I'm doing a partial recovery.

18
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:50,150
Here. Listen.

19
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:51,950
Isn't that Detective Joo's voice?

20
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:53,060
Yes.

21
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:54,080
What about the culprit's voice?

22
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,690
I need to do further voice analysis.

23
00:01:56,690 --> 00:02:00,200
This analysis system can estimate the components

24
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:04,090
and will be able to verify the person's age, gender, and even height.

25
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:06,440
We'll get a composite of someone's voice.

26
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:10,410
Then we can compare it to the suspect's voice.

27
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:11,700
Let me know when you're done with the recovery.

28
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,400
Yes, Sir.

29
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:25,160
But this man, the more I see you, the more you look like him.

30
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:29,540
Can you pull your hair down? Can you, please?

31
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:31,560
You're Jeong Sa Bin's friend.

32
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:36,020
Let's properly introduce ourselves. I'm Jay. I'm a 3D graphic designer. I also work on hologram restoration and—

33
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:38,020
See you again then.

34
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:42,270
Do you like Sa Bin?

35
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:50,730
Then I have something to tell you.

36
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:52,370
What is it?

37
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:58,510
 Sa Bin has a stalker. 

38
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:01,780
 I'm 99% sure he's a psychopath. 

39
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:08,200
 He put a tracking app on her phone, stole her diary, and he's watching her every move. 

40
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:16,900
 Thank you. I'll return it to you once I'm done with the lecture. 

41
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:19,180
 - Okay. 
 - Bye. 

42
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:27,700
Broken heart syndrome.

43
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:33,760
This is one of the symptoms that appear when you lose someone you love.

44
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:38,260
it's when an otherwise healthy heart becomes severely damaged.

45
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:41,430
Now. The heart has a memory function.

46
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:45,000
You could say that the heart's nerves remember.

47
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,840
Now, there are many cells in the heart.

48
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,120
 I kill Jeong Sa Bin, and you kill me. 

49
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,100
 But which will be first? 

50
00:03:55,160 --> 00:04:01,070
A heart's long-term and short-term functions. The nerves—

51
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:09,580
Jong Beom.

52
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:14,580
Wow, Cheon Jong Beom! What's with these flowers and this card?

53
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:16,170
     

54
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:19,980
You have feelings for Professor—

55
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,860
Bo Hye, what happened? Jong Beom, please help—

56
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,070
You feel so cold.

57
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:38,330
Hey, Cheon Jong Beom!

58
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:49,490
There was a heart stimulant in it.

59
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:54,510
A substance that was extracted from a digitalis flower was detected in the coffee.

60
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:59,950
For people with heart conditions, it's deadly even in small amounts and can cause a heart attack.

61
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:04,200
But if you didn't send it, who did?

62
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:07,610
That flower and card were put there while I was gone.

63
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:13,070
I don't know who it was... but the person was after you.

64
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:17,330
If you're done with your lectures, I'll take you home, Senior.

65
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:19,260
Senior?

66
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:25,050
Anyway, go ahead. When Bo Hye wakes up, I'll take her home.

67
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:28,970
I'll wait. I want to talk to you about something.

68
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:37,790
This is a watch. Yours was broken because of me.

69
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:39,590
It's fine. I can get it fixed.

70
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:43,740
It's too sensitive. I don't think it can be repaired. If you don't want this, I'll give you the cost of the repair.

71
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:45,840
It's fine, I said.

72
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,700
I'll come to pick you up in the morning.

73
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,800
 There's no need to do that. 

74
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:04,960
I warned you, didn't I? To learn to feel sorry toward someone who got hurt because of you.

75
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:09,810
I'm sure I told you, too. I'm not someone you can teach.

76
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:16,470
House, hospital, NFS, Body Heat... Where else are you going to follow her?

77
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:20,850
I also wanted to let her know what the most dangerous is to her.

78
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:24,900
A punk who killed at age 15 and became a suspect in a murder case at age 23

79
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:27,800
is hanging around the woman I love.

80
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:30,260
What else could be more dangerous?

81
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:35,580
You know, I can take care of myself, so please leave.

82
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:38,830
I need to rest inside.

83
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:42,700
Let's go in.

84
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,530
Together?

85
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:48,870
I'll leave after making sure there's no one hanging around in front of the house.

86
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:03,030
But... what's that?

87
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,410
Can I come in for a moment?

88
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:11,340
Oh, if you give me time to clean up a little...

89
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:14,770
I just need a place to sit.

90
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:16,240
Okay.

91
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:20,730
Open it.

92
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:31,190
I don't know what I was expecting...

93
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:33,690
I'll tell you how to use each one.

94
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:38,250
This is a gas gun. Try holding it.

95
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:41,440
Hold it. Come on.

96
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:47,530
Are you telling me to carry around a gas gun, spray, self-defense rod, and a taser?

97
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:56,220
A detective who was investigating the Im Hwa Yeong case was stabbed,

98
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:59,390
and Cheon Jong Beom was seen on the gallery's security camera.

99
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:03,640
You never listen to me, and that guy keeps hanging around you.

100
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:07,610
I'm sure Jong Beom didn't do that to Detective Joo In Do.

101
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:09,390
What did you say?

102
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:14,550
I... even commune with the remains.

103
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,980
But I've experienced Jong Beom alive.

104
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:20,050
I was able to commune with him.

105
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:25,690
He goes between good and evil countless times a day, but he wants to change, desperately.

106
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:27,510
Saying that type of person murdered—

107
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:32,550
Even if you agonize over it for 10 hours, it only takes three seconds to cut someone's artery.

108
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:38,270
Even if you regret and repent, the dead won't come back to life in those three seconds.

109
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:40,980
Cheon Jong Beom killing someone at age 15,

110
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:44,320
fine, let's say that he repented.

111
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,590
But painting the picture means he's ruminating over the murder.

112
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:53,550
He painted the woman he killed. He's remembering it, like a trophy.

113
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:59,070
It makes me shudder. Just thinking about him painting you, I...

114
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:14,850
If you keep driving him as the murderer, he'll become one, one day.

115
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:20,430
If there's a way to stop the memory of the murder, this is the time. I'll make that happen.

116
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:26,240
My father believed in a certain murderer.

117
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,260
Like you now.

118
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:32,570
But do you know what he did as soon as he was released?

119
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:38,130
Murdered. Jeong Sa Bin, why in the world...

120
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:48,800
If he's dangerous, the one in danger now isn't me, it's you.

121
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:56,610
I'm going to protect you. And in order to do that, I'm going to keep Jong Beom from becoming a murderer.

122
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,590
That's right. You have to watch her all night.

123
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:17,480
That's what stalkers do.

124
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:21,160
Why? You want to tell me it's a crush?

125
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:23,160
That won't lessen the charges for stalking.

126
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:26,830
Compared to a man who doesn't know who's putting his woman in danger,

127
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:30,190
a stalker who can protect his woman is better, don't you think?

128
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:32,270
His woman?

129
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:37,820
Who is your woman? You just want to possess her.

130
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:41,850
What are you going to do if she says she doesn't like you? Are you going to kill her?

131
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:43,640
I don't kill someone I love.

132
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:47,070
This is what you call love?

133
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:51,880
When you love someone, you ruin them in order to keep them next to you forever.

134
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:54,960
- Isn't that true? 
 - Have you seen it personally?

135
00:10:56,570 --> 00:10:59,690
Jeong Sa Bin won't come to you.

136
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:03,250
Since she's my woman now, got it?

137
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:09,480
Don't even look at her. It offends me.

138
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:16,190
Why? Can't you hold back?

139
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:18,890
You feel like you need to go kill someone tonight?

140
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:22,230
I told you my principle, didn't I? Get away from her.

141
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:24,370
Do you want me to tell you my principle?

142
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:29,640
Once I decide to kill someone, I never stop

143
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:32,340
until that person is dead.

144
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:34,840
Now you're showing your true colors.

145
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:41,060
Fine. Then you kill me first.

146
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:46,130
No matter how badly you want to kill someone, don't ever forget that order.

147
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,920
I have a question.

148
00:11:56,870 --> 00:12:01,390
If it was someone else who had a crush on her, would you have said the same thing?

149
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:05,870
I wonder if you would say the same thing

150
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:10,280
if an ordinary person watches the woman he likes and can't give up.

151
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,750
When a normal person likes someone, they probably won't stalk her like you.

152
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:23,090
If you're reborn, try being one. A normal person.

153
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:34,750
That's why I'm going to try and become one. A normal person.

154
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,730
 Do you want me to tell you my principle? 

155
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:49,540
 Once I decide to kill someone, I never stop 

156
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:51,770
 until that person is dead. 

157
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:05,630
Once Detective Joo's memory chip is restored, compare it with the voice recording I just sent you.

158
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:26,730
 Bo Hye! Jong Beom, please help— 

159
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:31,800
 There was a heart stimulant in it. 

160
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:59,760
 I changed my watch, but will you still protect me? 

161
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:14,390
   

162
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,200
   

163
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:28,230
 010-1237-9916. It's the number of my new watch. 

164
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:33,390
 I ask for your protection until I'm more familiar with self-defense martial arts. 

165
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:35,330
   

166
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:38,910
   

167
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:04,730
I have five other copies besides this one.

168
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:07,020
Your pictures from the gallery.

169
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:10,710
Don't worry. I won't report you.

170
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:15,020
I'm thinking about being friends with you.

171
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:16,290
What changed?

172
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:19,760
I found out that you were dumped by Prosecutor Kim.

173
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:24,040
It made me take an interest in you.

174
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:31,560
I'm curious. Are you trying to kill Jeong Sa Bin because of Kim Soo Hyeok?

175
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,370
- Not sure. 
 - Not sure?

176
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:38,200
If it's because of Kim Soo Hyeok, I don't want to kill her so quickly.

177
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:43,780
She has to suffer as much as I did. No, more than that, don't you think?

178
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:51,920
But if it's because of you, I want to kill her right away. It excites me.

179
00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:02,640
How about this? I'll invite you this time.

180
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:06,420
Don't you want to see my first murder?

181
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:09,230
Are you serious?

182
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:13,150
Tonight at 10:00. I'll text you the location.

183
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:32,770
Cheon Jong Beom. Jeong Sa Bin...

184
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:40,370
   

185
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,870
 From now on, if you have thoughts of wanting to kill someone, 

186
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:59,640
 imagine my face on top of the person who you want to kill. 

187
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:16,180
 If you still want to kill them, think of that bloody hand that stabbed me as your own. 

188
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,010
   

189
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:54,500
 If Cheon Jong Beom commits murder for the first time, who would he kill first? 

190
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:58,000
 Songin Elementary School, Seoul Special City? 

191
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:05,370
     

192
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:21,770
   

193
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:34,780
Songin Elementary School, please.

194
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:41,900
You put your phone on silent, right?

195
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:48,490
- Let's begin. 
 - Yes, Sir.

196
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:49,910
 Wasn't this the invitation? 

197
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:52,850
This is the only voice recovered from Detective Joo In Do's memory chip.

198
00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:56,020
Also, I did a comparison with the voice recording you sent me.

199
00:18:56,020 --> 00:19:00,520
 Once I decide to kill someone, until that person dies, 

200
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:01,740
 I never give up. 

201
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:05,270
The voice spectrum lines up perfectly.

202
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:07,760
It's the same person.

203
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:08,860
Should we mobilize?

204
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:12,120
We can't. Not officially.

205
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:18,680
 The phone has been turned off. 

206
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,900
   

207
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:24,890
   

208
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:27,560
 You have one unheard voicemail. 

209
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:31,380
 Prosecutor Kim, you're not at Songin Elementary School right now, are you? 

210
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:36,270
 It's a relief if you're not. Please absolutely do not go there tonight. 

211
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:40,320
   

212
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:44,210
Songin Elementary School.

213
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:46,950
   

214
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:50,270
Stayed in an abandoned building for three days with the female student who he killed by making her fall.

215
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:53,100
   

216
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:32,020
What are you going to do all by yourself?

217
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:36,080
He always slips out anyway. And when he does, someone will die again.

218
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:40,050
You want to see that happen? Stand by until I call you, and don't tell the others.

219
00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:43,010
You're always getting hurt! What are you telling me not to tell the others for?

220
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:45,330
Let me go with you.

221
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:36,720
It's me, Jong Beom.

222
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,560
What is it?

223
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:41,150
I caught Im Hwa Yeong's real murderer, Father.

224
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:46,080
You said you'd trust me if I did.

225
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,780
You caught the real murderer?

226
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:52,080
Yes. And I found evidence, too.

227
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:57,630
I didn't kill Im Hwa Yeong, Father.

228
00:21:57,630 --> 00:22:02,470
Then, did you do that to Detective Joo In Do?

229
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:11,090
Is your new misunderstanding starting again?

230
00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:13,150
Let's hang up.

231
00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:52,730
   

232
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,530
Is that you, Jong Beom?

233
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:26,110
Don't kill anyone but Jeong Sa Bin.

234
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:16,460
I warned you not to touch my people.

 Don't die yet. You still have a lot left to do.
