1
00:00:01,450 --> 00:00:02,790
   

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:08,100
Our Mr. Lee Bo So came from the earth, so the earth should reveal the answers to us, right?

3
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:09,490
Now...

4
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:11,190
Let's begin.

5
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:13,000
Scalpel.

6
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:22,200


7
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:29,250
The eyes should be set a little deeper.

8
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:30,780
- Deeper? 
 - Hold on.

9
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:34,830
The skin should be thinner on this side.

10
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:44,180
Deeper...

11
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:54,590
I'm mapping next.

12
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:04,790
Mapping someone who is a total stranger is the most difficult.

13
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:09,310
DNA is one thing, it's really done by feel.

14
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:14,650
Have we really not seen this face somewhere before?

15
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:21,790
Eyes that complement this type of nose and pale skin...

16
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:25,490
Good. I want these pupils.

17
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:28,530
You can see the iris that's like a black hole sucking you in, right?

18
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:32,380
- Okay. 
 - And his hair...

19
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:37,060
Not brushed back but falling forward.

20
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:39,890
Forward? Okay.

21
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:45,050
Let's try again.

22
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:48,310
Hair falling forward...

23
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:53,420
This man... I feel like he would have worn a uniform.

24
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:55,410
Uniform?

25
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:57,630
What are you talking about?

26
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:03,100
And I think a walkie-talkie would have suited him.

27
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:17,020
It's just like... a face I've seen somewhere.

28
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:26,630
   
  

29
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:01,700
   

30
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:11,740
 Things that are hard for me 

31
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:19,800
 are too easy for someone else. 

32
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:55,840
Go in.

33
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:58,440
I'll go.

34
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,980
Drive safe.

35
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:07,590
Wait.

36
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:17,570
I don't think I'll be able to send you a wedding invitation.

37
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:23,250
I... broke off the engagement.

38
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:36,020
Broke it off?

39
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:37,730
Why?

40
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,100
No way... Because of me?

41
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,180
Was it because of me?

42
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:04,350
What is because of you?

43
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:12,250
I saw on the way home, but what's with the strange energy between you and Prosecutor Kim?

44
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:15,440
He said... he's not getting married.

45
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,070
He was seeing someone?

46
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:20,010
Then if it's because of you, are you saying he likes you?

47
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:22,130
Is it because of the experiment?

48
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:26,630
That experiment is... So that experiment was the problem.

49
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:30,650
Come on, take your medicine.

50
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:32,620
Hurry up. Drink up.

51
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:34,500
Drink, drink.

52
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:23,600
What's this?

53
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:26,120
 Oh! Blood, blood! 
     

54
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:29,260
Blood, blood! 
    

55
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:31,370
They say it was specially produced.

56
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:36,650
It's an arrowhead made from titanium alloy, but it's like a well-sharpened dagger.

57
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:43,640
He survived after being stabbed with this 11 times. I guess Detective Joo doesn't die that easily.

58
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,510
What's the status on his cell phone?

59
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:50,750
Oh, the memory chip was badly damaged, so it'll take time to restore it.

60
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:52,230
What about the security cameras near the mail box?

61
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:55,710
There weren't any security cameras, but since it's a residential area,

62
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:59,980
there was a video taken by a parked vehicle's black box.

63
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:03,550
It's a crazy perverted bastard. Is he asking to be found?

64
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:06,340
What about people who entered the gallery around the time of the murder?

65
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:10,390
There was a guy captured by the security camera at Yuhon Gallery's entrance.

66
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:17,340
Cheon Jong Beom. His bike was captured by a security camera on a nearby road, too.

67
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:20,990
But he's also the one who reported the incident.

68
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:24,900
He's a strong suspect.

69
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:32,490
He really does like going to places by himself!

70
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:35,420
   

71
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:48,250
- Yes. 
  - We obtained a written statement from the witness under Chief Prosecutor Cheon's orders, 

72
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:52,100
 and there was a car that was trailing Cheon Jong Beom's bike, 

73
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:54,300
 and it belongs to Gang Doo Cheol. 

74
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:58,430
 What's interesting is that Yuhon Gallery's director is also Gang Doo Cheol. 

75
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:02,320
 According to the statement, Cheon Jong Beom is a fan of Gang Doo Cheol's artist. 

76
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,990
 But something's fishy. 

77
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:08,980
Someone who provided a location for the murder at that time and switched the paintings around...

78
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:11,760
He was obviously an accomplice.

79
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:14,350
Look into Gang Doo Cheol.

80
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:22,960
 Detective Joo arrives at the gallery at 9:20. 

81
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,810
 Cheon Jong Beom enters the gallery at 9:27. 

82
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:30,920
 Detective Joo texts me at 9:28. 

83
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:35,780
 Cheon Jong Beom leaves the gallery and calls in a report at 9:45. 

84
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:13,550
 The painting that Gong Ji Cheol did is hanging here. 

85
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:16,750
 It's a painting he did after killing the girl. 

86
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:29,160
 Do you think you're the only one in danger? 

87
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:32,230
 Don't you have anyone who you want to protect? 

88
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:53,190
   

89
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:04,490
Why are you dragging your feet on Baek In Seok's summons investigation while digging into useless things?

90
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:09,420
Hand over Joo In Do's case to Prosecutor Shin Yeong Gin. You have no investigative rights.

91
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:12,410
It's a revenge murder of a prosecutor who was pursuing him as a suspect.

92
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:17,020
He even confirmed that he was the culprit on the security camera. You should already know very well

93
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:19,320
who the suspect is.

94
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,200
Revenge murder?

95
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:25,990
Watch your words. Did somebody kill someone?

96
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:27,660
Who died?

97
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:31,420
I will see this case to the end.

98
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:38,650
Do you want me to send you to the Criminal Trial Department?

99
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:43,110
Every piece of trash you threw in jail,

100
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:45,400
do you want to see them all acquitted and released?

101
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:51,800
If you pick up a dagger, you should wield it carefully.

102
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:55,290
To plan out the schemes that you love so much, you need power.

103
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:59,820
And that scheme can only be planned in your own playground.

104
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,940
How dare you?

105
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:12,980
He wants to slip out this time, too?

106
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:30,440
Yes, Uncle.

107
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:34,130
 Never mind fried chicken or whatever, I got a totally naked one! 

108
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:37,780
 When I got stabbed, I got healed after having chicken soup, too! 

109
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:40,410
 Get over here quick! 

110
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,370
Why didn't you come last night?

111
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:03,290
I knew it. You couldn't find the bookstore.

112
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:04,820
I came by last night.

113
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:07,840
You did? Then why...

114
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:11,690
You were with that guy, Kim Soo Hyeok.

115
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:17,420
You-You saw us last night at Old Futureâ€”

116
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:19,720
I saw you kissing.

117
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:29,200
When you're nervous, you put one foot up and kick the ground.

118
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:35,410
You close your mouth completely and speak with your eyes. This is when you're worried.

119
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:39,890
You move the area over your brows more and your pupils dilate.

120
00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:44,120
You shake your head adamantly two or three times. This is when you're angry.

121
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:48,300
- I do? 
 - What kind of expression you'd have in front of someone you like...

122
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,420
I was curious.

123
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:02,930
Jong Beom, I have something to tell you.

124
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:07,150
I... like Kim Soo Hyeok.

125
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:10,550
I've never liked someone this much before.

126
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:15,040
Also... like how your feelings won't change,

127
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,640
mine won't change.

128
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:22,350
Do you think he can protect you?

129
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:27,110
I'm sure if we wait and see, we'll know who protects you.

130
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:31,930
I have a lot of reports to write, so I'll be going.

131
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:41,650
I like chicken soup, too.

132
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:12,090
 He's the person who won't let me into your heart, so I had to kill him. 

133
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:18,350
 This is the first time I've wanted to kill someone because I came to love someone. 

134
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,830
   

135
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:34,480
Wh-Where are you?

136
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,260
 Here. 

137
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:11,970
â™«   Meeting you   â™«

138
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:18,100
â™«   I don't want it to become a sad destiny   â™«

139
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:25,830
â™«   That it's only fate  â™«

140
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:33,200
â™«   It remains even in flowing tears   â™«

141
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:39,890
â™«   So I can be with your forever   â™«

142
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:48,420
â™«   Ooh ooh ooh   â™«

143
00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:01,010
â™«   My exhausted soul that can't be reached   â™«

144
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:04,220
 That was the expression. 

145
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:09,580
â™«   So that it won't be tired anymore   â™«

146
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:19,150
 That woman... will I be able to have her? 

147
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:28,170
   

148
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:34,120
This is a date, right?

149
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:37,280
You can only go on dates if you're alive.

150
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:40,190
While you shoot, spread your legs shoulder-width apart.

151
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:42,160
Your hand shouldn't be at the bottom

152
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,470
but on the entire handle.

153
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:47,130
And your eyes fixed directly in front.

154
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:49,130
Try holding it.

155
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:50,790
They aren't real bullets, right?

156
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:53,070
They are real bullets.

157
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:57,900
â™«   Your eyes looking at me   â™«

158
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:01,650
Here, try shooting.

159
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:07,770
Step aside. I've used BB guns before a few times.

160
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:15,480
â™«   When I look at you, the whole world   â™«

161
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,060
That scared me.

162
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:18,800
Try one more time.

163
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:23,170
Okay. Again.

164
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:24,240
Again.

165
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,880
â™«   Even if someday a difficult time comes for us   â™«

166
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,010
Again.

167
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:34,770
â™«   I will not leave   â™«

168
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:40,740
â™«   Even if the warm wind carries me away   â™«

169
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:45,620
My fights are done while holding something like this. Not a parking stub.

170
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:50,610
Just holding it could hurt someone.

171
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:54,670
If you use it wrong, I could die or someone next to me could die.

172
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:58,210
â™«   Even if I'm just looking at you   â™«

173
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:03,670
â™«   You're the one I want to see   â™«

174
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:19,220
Do you... normally like shooting that much?

175
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:22,820
I've never seen you concentrate so hard.

176
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:26,620
Out of 10 shots, I always miss the last two.

177
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:31,260
The first one I miss because the last image I have of my father's face comes to mind,

178
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:37,490
and the other I miss because my own face that couldn't protect my father comes to mind.

179
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:41,100
Your father... passed away?

180
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:46,340
Father's face... is similar to yours.

181
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:55,530
This face... A face that trusts people.

182
00:18:55,530 --> 00:19:00,160
So I get worried and angry when I see you.

183
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:03,320
That's why I need to protect you, no matter what.

184
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:08,570
I...

185
00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:11,590
won't become a scar, too, you like your father.

186
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:14,750
I promise.

187
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:48,380
Mom told me... that death is the only means of total possession.

188
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:53,540
You'll never change, will you? That's why I'm not killing you.

189
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:05,610
 It-it's been taken care of. 

190
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:10,010
 Your... photos on the cell-cell phone 

191
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:13,160
 will be forwarded to the laptop. 

192
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:16,770
 You-You got the laptop, right? 

193
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:25,020
What is this?

194
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:29,290
We keep running into each other.

195
00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:31,040
You're laughing?

196
00:22:49,810 --> 00:22:52,910
 Jong Beom, hurry up and get out here! 

197
00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:55,380
 It's getting cold! 

198
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:13,660
Good-looking guys like Jong Beom have no dating technique.

199
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:18,260
Why? Because women are always taking a number and waiting in line.

200
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:22,620
That's why I'm saying this, but you've never had a deep relationship. Right?

201
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:25,470
Men can't be too bland.

202
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:29,030
You have to be hot enough to make the women's tears fall fromâ€”

203
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:32,820
Why is this bastard always talking about women?

204
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:35,440
Are you sure you've dated before?

205
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,820
That's how you conned money out of them, right?

206
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:42,290
But then, there are no women interested in you now that you're old.

207
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:46,480
This monkfish that has never even gotten dipped into a soup is dissing me again!

208
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,880
Look, Jong Beom,

209
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:53,760
you should never date women that are too pretty.

210
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,140
The wounds on your body might disappear,

211
00:23:56,140 --> 00:24:02,560
but the wounds in your heart can never be erased even with a laser.

212
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,580
Got it?

213
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:07,170
Look at these uncles.

214
00:24:07,170 --> 00:24:10,530
Feeding me scorched rice and giving him chicken legs and wings.

215
00:24:10,530 --> 00:24:13,410
You only see him and not me, right?

216
00:24:15,610 --> 00:24:17,800
You can't drink. You left the hospital only two days ago.

217
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:21,580
Just one drink. If you drink happily, it becomes healthy.

218
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:25,370
â™ª Hey now â™ª

219
00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:26,910
My seniors from my baseball club are coming.

220
00:24:26,910 --> 00:24:30,020
I'm sorry but I have to get going.

221
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:35,370
How can the chef be such a drunkard?! Hurry up and come down!

222
00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:36,800
Oh...

223
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:43,850
You know, Jong Beom, don't let Sa Bin go to sleep.

224
00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:48,600
She knows better, but she'll keep on drinking

225
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:52,080
and fall asleep with her head hanging.

226
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:55,250
Come on! You never learn!

227
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:11,460
You looked happy.

228
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:21,650
When I first met you, you were the happiest person I ever met,

229
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:24,640
but you had received a heart transplant.

230
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:30,640
Your uncles were both ex-convicts, and your dad was ill,

231
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:34,180
and your mom was never around since you were born.

232
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:39,330
What you're saying means that you can also become happy.

233
00:25:40,370 --> 00:25:43,870
You can look at only the things you have right now.

234
00:25:45,690 --> 00:25:48,030
Things I have?

235
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:16,280
I heard that unhappy people only wish for things that can't come true.

236
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:20,040
I guess I look unhappy.

237
00:26:21,090 --> 00:26:25,770
You want to forget your past, yet you live without letting go of it.

238
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:32,610
If you have nowhere to throw it away, throw it away to me.

239
00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:35,170
Throw what away?

240
00:26:35,170 --> 00:26:41,200
What happened when you were 15... Can you tell me?

241
00:26:43,150 --> 00:26:45,240
Jong Beom...

242
00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:05,370
I heard that there's an initial moment when anyone can become infected with evil.

243
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:30,590
 I thought you just disliked me. 

244
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:35,580
 But I realized while watching you. 

245
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:40,010
 You just don't feel emotions. 

246
00:27:40,010 --> 00:27:46,860
 This blank look isn't lack of interest, it's that you just didn't know. 

247
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:53,470
 My heart hurts this much, but you just didn't have any feelings. 

248
00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:57,780
 Fool. Idiot. 

249
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:16,480
 That's when I first knew. 

250
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:19,640
 That I was different from everyone else. 

251
00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:29,890
 I believe in life after death. 

252
00:28:29,890 --> 00:28:35,140
 For three days, I thought  

253
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:38,610
 she might be able to come back to life like a miracle. 

254
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:54,330
 How long had it been? 

255
00:28:56,890 --> 00:29:01,370
 I started to draw without realizing. 

256
00:29:01,370 --> 00:29:04,490
Why... did you acknowledge the murder?

257
00:29:04,490 --> 00:29:11,000
Because I realized that murder can give me freedom.

258
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:19,940
No one in the world is born a murderer.

259
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:23,340
Freedom? Back then you were scared.

260
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:26,390
I'm sure you had no one to tell about being scared.

261
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:31,400
And there was probably no one who could have told you you made the wrong choice.

262
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:38,680
A younger brother who put detergent in your drink, a father who didn't believe that his son was not a murderer.

263
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:41,960
And your mom, was she different?

264
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:49,180
Out of your family members, no one else came to see you other than your brother who tried to feed you detergent.

265
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:55,980
Do you want to become family?

266
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:56,990
Family?

267
00:29:56,990 --> 00:29:59,970
Someone who takes your side and tells you off.

268
00:29:59,970 --> 00:30:03,850
If I'm your family, then my uncles will be, too.

269
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:11,070
I'm an ex-convict too, so I guess we are family.

270
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:15,050
So let's have a drink to celebrate becoming a family.

271
00:30:17,870 --> 00:30:19,550
Sit down.

272
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:27,220
Here.

273
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:48,980
I read Romeo and Juliet many times.

274
00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:56,050
After Juliet died, why Romeo killed himself...

275
00:30:57,570 --> 00:31:03,500
Why Juliet killed herself after seeing Romeo who died because of her...

276
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:06,730
I realized by the time I memorized the whole book.

277
00:31:07,910 --> 00:31:14,210
I'm someone... who can never feel that.

278
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:28,280
Other people call this love.

279
00:31:29,630 --> 00:31:34,850
Your eyes become hot and your mouth becomes dry,

280
00:31:34,850 --> 00:31:37,260
and your breathing becomes faster,

281
00:31:38,890 --> 00:31:42,430
and you become soft-hearted.

282
00:31:42,430 --> 00:31:45,640
You're this close to me...

283
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:47,100
â™«   This heart of mine   â™«

284
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:53,870
...but I'm scared when you might disappear.

285
00:31:56,760 --> 00:32:05,340
â™«   The way that you look sad sometimes   â™«

286
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:07,990
â™«   I tried to pretend not to know   â™«

287
00:32:07,990 --> 00:32:11,420
Not family...

288
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:14,730
Please be my woman.

289
00:32:14,730 --> 00:32:18,190
â™«   I wonder if you'll get to know my heart   â™«

290
00:32:19,130 --> 00:32:25,000
â™«   Even though I know you can't come to me   â™«

291
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:36,110
â™«   I say that I'm fine even though it hurts, this is not goodbye   â™«
