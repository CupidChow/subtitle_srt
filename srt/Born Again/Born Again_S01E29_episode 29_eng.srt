1
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:16,570
     

2
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:27,140


3
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:35,800
  It is now January 25, 1988.  

4
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:39,980
  The time is 5:15 in the morning.  

5
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:42,510
  I love you, Hyeong Bin.  

6
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:46,540
 Don't forget my voice that's saying this. 

7
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:53,210
 Even after 20 or 30 years... 

8
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:57,790
 I will still miss you. 

9
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:24,490
 Today alone, she had three cardiac episodes. 

10
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:27,620
 I don't know how she's still hanging on, 

11
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:32,450
 but what she says to you, Father, will be her last will and testament. 

12
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:38,740
  Father...  

13
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:46,930
  Are you still... not able to find Hyeong Bin?  

14
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:53,610
  Until Hyeong Bin... comes to find me...  

15
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:57,380
  I... can't die.  

16
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:05,260
 Sister, death isn't the end, it's the door to another world. 

17
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:08,080
  Have faith in the time of eternity,  

18
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:13,290
  In that time, the two of you will meet again.  

19
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:15,520
  No.  

20
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:25,550
 If Hyeong Bin has died... please.... 

21
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:30,990
 let me at least see his body. 

22
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:33,020
 Please. 

23
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:56,270
     

24
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:58,190
 We received a report around 1:00 p.m. 

25
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:03,710
 The tenant suddenly died, and the cleaning lady found her. 

26
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:10,140
So this photo belonged to the new tenant?

27
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:11,870
Yes, that's right.

28
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:14,810
Prosecutor, have a look at this.

29
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,690
It's Gong In Woo, isn't it?

30
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:23,420
1980, July 13th. That's the day the second victim, Jo In Yeong, was killed.

31
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:28,330
Taking a photo with the victim after the murder... He's a real monster.

32
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:33,420
Commemorates the killing... Then I'm sure there are other photos, too.

33
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:35,260
Who had this?

34
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:37,840
Gong In Woo's former wife, Park In Sook.

35
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,970
Gong Ji Cheol's stepmother?

36
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:44,770
Yes. She was a tenant, but it seems like she suddenly passed away not too long ago.

37
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:46,040
Anything else that stands out?

38
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:49,720
Well, for now, just this photo.

39
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:55,090
Search thoroughly, and find out if this was taken by her or someone else.

40
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:56,620
Yes, I understand.

41
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:58,590
Just a minute.

42
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:03,840
In Do, make sure to keep this under wraps and don't let the higher-ups find out.

43
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,720
Yes, Sir.

44
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,630
 Please come out, Chief Prosecutor Cheon! 

45
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:12,990
 He should be out soon. 

46
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:15,370
  Why isn't he coming out? Seriously.  

47
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:19,930
 Mr. Gong, who was arrested on charges of attempted murder at a nursing hospital in Yongin, 

48
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:23,430
 is suspected of being the real culprit in the Yellow Umbrella murder case 

49
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:28,680
 which Cheon Seok Tae, candidate for Director of the Public Prosecutors' Office, supervised. 

50
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:32,530
 Candidate Cheon is embroiled in suspicions of the cover-up and manipulation of evidence 

51
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:36,020
 during the course of the investigation. 

52
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:50,840
  - There he is!   
   - Oh! Where, where?  

53
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,130
 Chief Prosecutor Cheon! 

54
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:54,120
  Take a picture! Take a picture!  

55
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,630
What exactly are you doing?

56
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:09,370
This is how you're doing your job?!

57
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:11,490
I didn't know.

58
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:18,240
If Gong In Woo comes clean, know that it's all over for you and me.

59
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:25,020
Seeing how Kim Soo Hyeok is acting up, we don't know what evidence he has on Gong In Woo.

60
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:30,410
 Make sure you take care of it well. If not, I'll make sure you meet your daughter behind bars. 

61
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:33,530
You have no right to speak so confidently.

62
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:36,830
If something happens to me, what do you think will happen to you?

63
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:39,040
Do you think I'll go down alone?

64
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,170
Jang Hye Mi!

65
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:55,290
I'll make this short.

66
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:58,510
Get rid of Kim Soo Hyeok neatly.

67
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:03,980
If not, I'll hand every case connected to the chairman over to the police.

68
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:09,980
I'll say I couldn't help it because I was threatened by you and your guys.

69
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:13,060
As you know, Chairman has an illness,

70
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:15,760
so all he has to do is be admitted to the hospital for a few days.

71
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:21,910
  Hyungnim... this time I'll do it properly.  

72
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:25,400
Ma Cheol. Jang Ma Cheol.

73
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,920
Yes, Big Bro.

74
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,180
You're my little bro, right?

75
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:29,930
Yes, Big Bro.

76
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:30,960
You're my family, right?

77
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,700
Yes, Big Bro.

78
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:33,940
Chang Soon.

79
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:34,680
Yes, Big Bro.

80
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:37,070
Take care of our guys well.

81
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:43,140
This time I'm going myself. All of you stay put.

82
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,120
Yes?

83
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,710
Kim Soo Hyeok, have you been well?

84
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:58,960
- Who... 
 - I'm still mad that I didn't get to stab you in your side.

85
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,440
But I guess you've already forgotten me.

86
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,480
Seo Tae Ha?

87
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:04,080
 I don't usually touch women, 

88
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,390
but the woman who was stabbed instead of you...

89
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:08,200
I told you not to touch that woman, didn't I?

90
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:11,330
She's here with me now. Hurry and come over here.

91
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:13,140
  You know to come alone, don't you?  

92
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:17,560
I'll send you the address, so come quickly. I can't wait long.

93
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:25,300
 The person you called is unavailable. 

94
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:39,570
  Brother Tae Ha just left to go kill Kim Soo Hyeok.  

95
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:41,380
 I told you it's not time yet. 

96
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:47,610
  That's why you should stop him. If he gets caught this time, he'll spend the rest of his life in prison.  

97
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:58,300
Jeong Sa Bin... Sa Bin!

98
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:00,620
Sa Bin!

99
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:02,860
Jeong Sa Bin!

100
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:09,090
  Long time no see, Kim Soo Hyeok.  

101
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:11,620
You should be looking for me since I asked you here. Why someone else?

102
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:13,230
Where is Jeong Sa Bin?

103
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:16,690
Who knows, you try looking for her.

104
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:18,770
I said where is she?

105
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,880
Why?

106
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:32,230
Does it drive you insane that I'm messing with your person?

107
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:36,020
Then what about my brother, Seong Ha? You also shouldn't have messed with my good little brother.

108
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:38,940
Good little brother?

109
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:42,740
In your world, you call pedophiles good?

110
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:09,720
Where is Jeong Sa Bin?

111
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:12,940
I guess you don't know too well, but I don't touch women.

112
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:14,730
How can I believe what you say?

113
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:16,160
You love that woman, don't you?

114
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:20,730
What? How is that any of your business?

115
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:23,310
He was in love with her.

116
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:30,250
The reason Seong Ha was by the daycare center was because he was in love with a teacher there.

117
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:35,830
That's the best you could come up with? Then, why did he mess with the kids?

118
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:37,400
Listen up well.

119
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:42,880
Your brother Seo Seong Ha didn't hang himself because he was wronged but because he was ashamed, you bastard.

120
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:46,050
This won't do.

121
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:51,640
Let me avenge my brother and end our ill fate here.

122
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,980
You bastard!

123
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:58,730
Are you kidding, do you want to die?

124
00:09:58,730 --> 00:09:59,630
Let go, you jerk!

125
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:01,140
I'm going to kill Kim Soo Hyeok!

126
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:03,140
Do you think Seong Ha would've wanted this?

127
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:08,130
Do you think he wants you to become a murderer for avenging him?

128
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:15,400
No one wants someone they love to become a murderer.

129
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:31,710
True revenge isn't done by shedding blood.

130
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:38,300
It's done by keeping the person alive and making them admit to their sins.

131
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:56,290
 Let's do this. 

132
00:10:56,290 --> 00:11:00,220
 That this is the woman that Byeon Seong Hoon killed 10 years ago. They're unidentifiable remains. 

133
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:01,580
 We have to use them. 

134
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:04,910
 That's the only way we can put him behind bars for life. 

135
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:10,320
How is it? Facing your true self?

136
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:16,760
I'm sure Byeon Seong Hoon would have killed someone else if he had been released.

137
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:23,290
I only prevented that bastard from killing someone again!

138
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:28,200
Who are you to prevent it? Are you a god?

139
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:41,160
Do you know what this is?

140
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:45,410
This is the list of people whose cases you manipulated and imprisoned and what happened to them.

141
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:48,470
One of their kids became a criminal because he wasn't looked after,

142
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:54,580
and another's mother died because her son went to prison. Is this the justice you're speaking of?

143
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,900
Hey, you bastard!

144
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:05,100
You're just a murdering prosecutor, you know that?

145
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:23,910
  Ha Eun... Ha Eun.  

146
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:26,560
  Please save Ha Eun.  

147
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:39,920
  Until Hyeong Bin... comes to find me...  

148
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:44,490
  I... can't die.  

149
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:04,880
Miss, are you awake now?

150
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,240
Mister...

151
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,180
This is the hospital... Do you remember fainting?

152
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:15,640
But when did you get here, Mr. Seung Cheol?

153
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,100
You know my name?

154
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:20,900
Of course! Why wouldn't I know your name?

155
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,820
You're my dad's friend.

156
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:24,720
What's your name, Miss?

157
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,590
I'm Ha Eun. Jeong Ha Eun.

158
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:29,910
How did this happen?

159
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:36,330
But, Mister, has Hyeong Bin not called yet?

160
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,620
Did you come knowing what happened to Hyeong Bin?

161
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,950
I didn't get a guardian's signature.

162
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:51,720
I'm not a guardian. Hang on a minute.

163
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:57,290
     

164
00:13:57,290 --> 00:14:01,920
I acknowledge that I've made mistakes because of my beliefs.

165
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,790
I'll change all the wrongs I've done.

166
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:08,130
But before that, Baek Sang Ha, Gong In Woo,

167
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:10,360
I need to throw both of them behind bars myself.

168
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:16,810
You'll need to hurry. Jang Hye Mi also has the remains list that you got.

169
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,080
Yes.

170
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,740
Ms. Jeong Sa Bin!

171
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,790
Hyeong Bin.

172
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:45,800
Hyeong Bin! Cha Hyeong Bin.

173
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,490
Do you know how long I've waited for you?

174
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:56,700
I thought I wouldn't see you again. Do you know how scared I was?

175
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:57,830
Ha Eun?

176
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:02,130
What happened? Where have you been until now?

177
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:06,540
Are you okay? You're not hurt?

178
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:10,460
Are you really Ha Eun?

179
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:22,030
It's like I'm dreaming, Hyeong Bin.

180
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,600
Gong Ji Cheol... no.

181
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,040
No! Don't come here!

182
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,150
Hyeong Bin, it's Gong Ji Cheol!

183
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:43,120
He'll try to kill me again!

184
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,500
Over here! Please call the police!

185
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:49,250
It's okay. No one's going to hurt you.

186
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:52,720
Don't worry. Nothing's going to happen.

187
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:19,240
  No, no! Stay away!  

188
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:22,990
 Hyeong Bin, it's Gong Ji Cheol! He'll try to kill me again! 

189
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,730
No.

190
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,550
It can't be.

191
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:43,630
No.

192
00:16:56,460 --> 00:17:00,760
     

193
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:20,200
What happened?

194
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:24,990
I'm sure I saw Hyeong Bin stabbed with a knife back then.

195
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:28,740
I can't remember what happened after.

196
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:43,050
Ms. Patient, don't move. Stay still.

197
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:48,930
Hyeong Bin... Detective Cha Hyeong Bin, it's really you. Right?

198
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:51,630
This isn't a dream, right?

199
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:13,370
Ms. Patient, your age, name, and family:

200
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:15,780
please tell me clearly.

201
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:18,100
Cha Hyeong Bin, you're...

202
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:26,070
32, Jeong Ha Eun. Lives in Munam-dong, unfortunately, lost her parents.

203
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:29,800
She has a fiancé who's very good looking but is also a little rough at times.

204
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:32,500
Happy now?

205
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:38,270
Also, my fiancé keeps pleading the Fifth

206
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:42,070
when I ask all night saying he can't remember

207
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:45,600
and that he'll tell me later.

208
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:49,460
But whether I'll forgive him or not, I'm still thinking about it.

209
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:59,410
I heard you were brought here because of your heart. How do you feel now?

210
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:00,870
I don't feel pain at all.

211
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:03,580
Until yesterday, I was in so much pain I could die.

212
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:07,220
But as soon as I saw you, I was completely fine.

213
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:08,990
Look.

214
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:14,110
Isn't it fascinating?

215
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:17,820
Don't keep jumping when your heart isn't good.

216
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:22,940
Hyeong Bin, I want to be discharged. Let's go home.

217
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:27,850
I'll go ask if you can be discharged.

218
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:47,860
What's this?

219
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:25,040
It's delicious.

220
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:29,300
I've been craving a hot dog since morning.

221
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:32,160
That's all you want to eat after getting discharged?

222
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,070
I told you to eat something more filling.

223
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:36,950
Why? I really like hot dogs.

224
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:39,980
Didn't you know?

225
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:41,290
Is that so?

226
00:20:41,290 --> 00:20:46,270
Of course, you were always busy. The things I like and what I eat during the day,

227
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:49,410
you've never paid attention to those things.

228
00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:53,460
What are you talking about? I know you best.

229
00:20:53,460 --> 00:21:00,310
You're stubborn, don't listen, and trust others too easily.

230
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:04,620
So you're saying I have principles, beliefs and subjectivity and that I'm kind, right?

231
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:07,710
That's not so bad then.

232
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:09,760
Let's do that.

233
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:16,160
♫   Even if the warm wind carries me away  ♫

234
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:19,570
♫   You're my one and only love  ♫

235
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:24,090
What are you doing? Put a coin in.

236
00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:29,300
♫   My dear, even if we don't say anything  ♫

237
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:31,110
♫   Even if I'm just looking at you  ♫

238
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:33,090
Why aren't you doing it? Hurry!

239
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:38,530
♫   You're the one I want to see  ♫

240
00:21:50,890 --> 00:21:55,470
I've done everything I wanted to do with you today.

241
00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:58,560
I have no regrets now.

242
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:03,550
If I knew you liked it this much, I would've taken you on dates more often.

243
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:06,030
Let's see each other often from now on, Ha Eun.

244
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:11,470
I think... I've heard that many times.

245
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:13,980
Thirty-two years ago.

246
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:26,570
Soo Hyeok, my memories as Sa Bin have returned, too.

247
00:22:32,610 --> 00:22:37,680
I found these rings at the hospital earlier.

248
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:42,080
I remembered all of the 32 years I lived as Jeong Sa Bin.

249
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:49,030
And... I remembered the moment you gave me the rings.

250
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:52,310
  What's this?  

251
00:22:58,490 --> 00:23:01,060
 I know this isn't the time, 

252
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:07,580
 but when the time comes, I want you to put it on me. 

253
00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:13,030
  What?  

254
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:16,910
 I met Jong Beom before you did. 

255
00:23:16,910 --> 00:23:19,750
 So how much do you know about him? 

256
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:22,760
 Why do you jump to conclusions about someone and brand them? 

257
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:25,820
 It's not that I hate the person who shot Cheon Jong Beom. 

258
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:29,610
 Knowing Cheon Jong Beom isn't the culprit but wanting to insist he is, 

259
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:33,560
 it's the person who doesn't regret shooting someone. 

260
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,490
     

261
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:49,930
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

262
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:57,260
Honestly, I didn't know whether to treat you as Hyeong Bin or Soo Hyeok.

263
00:23:57,260 --> 00:24:01,400
Did you feel the same... when you saw me, too?

264
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,840
To me...

265
00:24:09,130 --> 00:24:13,520
Jeong Ha Eun is you and Jeong Sa Bin is you, too.

266
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:21,840
Thirty years ago or now, my feelings toward you are the same.

267
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,940
♫   I don't want it to become a sad destiny   ♫

268
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:29,800
But... I don't know, I'm so confused.

269
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:36,620
When I see you, Ha Eun and Sa Bin's hearts feel different.

270
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:42,630
♫   It remains even in flowing tears   ♫

271
00:24:42,630 --> 00:24:46,200
It's okay. You just need more time, that's all.

272
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:53,680
Once we figure out why our past lives' memories returned, we'll be able to put everything back in its place.

273
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:56,830
♫   Pain rushes into the heart   ♫

274
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:04,520
♫   Even if I'm left alone again   ♫

275
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:28,790
♫   The memory of you that can't be erased   ♫

276
00:25:28,790 --> 00:25:34,500
♫   So that it won't be sad anymore    ♫

277
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:39,690
♫   The place that remained far away  ♫

278
00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:43,130

♫   In that dark and lonely place   ♫

280
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:51,610
 Heathcliff wasn't rude to the person who saved his life. 

281
00:25:51,610 --> 00:25:56,240
 He just wasn't able to feel affection when it was given. 

282
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:59,160
 You won't be able to hear if you sit so far away. 

283
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:02,930
  Could you come forward?  

284
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:05,560
  Is Heathcliff evil?  

285
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:11,360
  No. Heathcliff was in love. 

286

288
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:36,180
- Hello, elder. 
 - Oh.

289
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:38,870
You came looking for this, right?

290
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:42,800
Thank you. If not for you, I don't know what would have happened to me.

291
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:46,840
I was so surprised something bad happened to you.

292
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:48,500
Are you okay now?

293
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:50,540
Yes, I'm totally fine.

294
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:53,150
Oh, hold on... Here.

295
00:26:53,150 --> 00:26:57,900
I worried that giving you that would cause problems for you.

296
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:02,920
Still, I think it's only right that you keep it.

297
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:06,050
Okay, I'll keep it.

298
00:27:06,050 --> 00:27:07,120
Thank you.

299
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:11,600
Yesterday, I really... thought my friend's dead daughter came back.

300
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:17,490
It seems like your heart isn't good either, so please be careful.

301
00:27:17,490 --> 00:27:19,930
Yes, I'll get going then.

302
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:22,420
Goodbye, elder.

303
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:32,650
Why are you hiding here?

304
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:37,020
It's... Where was that book again?

305
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:38,950
Oh, it's right there.

306

♫   When did you go and not come back   ♫

307
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:48,360
Have your memories... returned?

308

♫   You who left a single leaf   ♫

309
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:55,000
Yesterday, you were really startled, weren't you? I'm sorry.

310
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,830
That's right, I'm Jeong Sa Bin.

311
00:27:58,830 --> 00:28:01,930
I would have acted the same way.

312
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:06,980
The person you saw yesterday would have looked like a monster.. No,

313
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:11,540
would have looked like the devil.

 ♫   That single lone leaf   ♫

315
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:20,700
♫   Even the moonlight   ♫

316
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:24,870
To be honest, I'm still very confused.

317
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:31,560
I know in my head that you're not that murderer from back then,

318
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:34,860
but it's not so easy for me...

319
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:39,800
Don't try so hard. I'll do it.

320
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:44,060
The memories of the devil that you remember,

321
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:50,670
I'll make sure I change them myself.

322
00:28:50,670 --> 00:28:56,240
♫   The flower cluster that couldn't bloom is sure to bloom   ♫
