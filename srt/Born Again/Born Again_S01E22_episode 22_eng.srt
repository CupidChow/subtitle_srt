00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:03,790
   

2
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:06,600
I'll issue a warrant, so carry out a search and seizure of Yuhon Gallery.

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,400
Gang Doo Cheol probably has an accomplice.

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,770
Follow him and get proof.

5
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,040
Gang Doo Cheol will need cash before he flees.

6
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:39,050
Wait for him at the ATM by the gallery and trail him.

7
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:43,000
 That pervert bastard is at a bank here right now. 

8
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:51,580
Kim S-Soo Hyeok found out. Yeah.

9
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:15,150
Cheon Jong Beom...

10
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,420
 Why do you judge people however you want and brand them? 

11
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:22,670
 I'm sure he didn't do that to Detective Joo In Do. 

12
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:24,300
 Are you going to say it's a copycat crime again? 

13
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:26,530
 The Im Hwa Yeong murder case? 

14
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:29,060
 She confessed while drunk. 

15
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:32,160
 That she killed her own baby. 

16
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,730
 He desperately wants to change. 

17
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:38,630
 I'm going to try being that normal person. 

18
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:44,330
Is he really not the one?

19
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:37,890
   

20
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:43,600
 The caller cannot answer the phone, so... 

21
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:49,310
   

22
00:02:55,110 --> 00:03:00,200
Professor Yoo, this is Kim Soo Hyeok. Is Jeong Sa Bin at the NFS right now?

23
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:35,780
Two hundred cuts drawn in one frame. Look at the tremendous work I did.

24
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:37,540
Hurry up and show me.

25
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:41,240
Now, we will resurrect the dead by breathing life into him.

26
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:45,490
Mr. Lee Bo So, please come alive to Sa Bin with your face 30 years ago.

27
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:49,790
Can you resurrect him holding a walkie-talkie?

28
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:05,010
This is... Prosecutor Kim.

29
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:07,690
It must be someone who looks like him.

30
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:41,980
   

31
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:44,820
   

32
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:16,700
 If you want to give the detective a burial, give him the book. 

33
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:20,400
 To be born as Gong Ji Cheol in his next life. 

34
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,630
 Gong Ji Cheol treasured that book. 

35
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:48,270
 You were killed on the happiest day of your life. 

36
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:51,770
 So that's why you weren't able to decay. Right? 

37
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:54,870
 You bought the ring to give to the woman you love, 

38
00:06:54,870 --> 00:07:00,120
 and you died while on the way to give it to her.

41
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,880
 Is it a wedding anniversary? 

42
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,860
 '83, April third... 

43
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:12,270
 It could be the day he first met his bride. 

44
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:15,220
 Like a special anniversary. 

45

♫   My lover who grazes by my past dream   ♫

 It's a keepsake found at the murder scene of Jeong Ha Eun's parents.

♫   You were that familiar image I may have seen somewhere   ♫

48
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:38,420
 So don't confess anything on the first night. 

49
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:41,250
 You won't be forgiven just because you confess. 

50
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:43,840
♫   The image of love I had forgotten   ♫

51
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:48,220
 If Tess hadn't confessed to Angel on the first night, 

52
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:51,080
 Angel wouldn't have left Tess, 

53
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:54,990
 and she wouldn't have become a murderess. 

54
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:59,030
 In the end, no one had to be unfortunate. 

55
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:04,490
♫   I'm afraid if I open my eyes   ♫

56
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:07,820
 Isn't confessing to a mistake considered courage? 

57
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:10,650
♫   So I am unable to open my eyes   ♫

♫   as I watch you   ♫

59
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:17,610
 Putting the burden of forgiveness on a person who's been hurt makes it harder for them. 

60
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:19,610
 I wouldn't confess if it was up to me. 

61
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:22,300
 Then you want people to live with the burden of that sin? 

62
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:25,820
 No. You can protect them. 

63
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:30,950
 Protect them while you're with them and put your life on the line just once.

 April 3rd, 1983, it was a spring day when snow fell.

00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:03,310
 I wanted to see this snow with you forever.

00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:29,510
 Look at you how? 

74
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:31,420
 Like you're looking at your ex. 

75
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:35,640

What happened? Are you ill?

81
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:21,650
- Ha Eun. 
 - Ha Eun?

82
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:27,200
Ha Eun, why am I lying here when you're the one who's sick?

Prosector Kim, you really aren't well.

You don't even recognize me.

What are you talking about? What do you mean?

86
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:39,960
What was so shocking about the hologram restoration?

87
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:43,010
You don't even know my name, Jeong Sa Bin.

88
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:45,080

Are you really...

91
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:00,510
Hold on, I'll go get the doctor.

92
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:28,500
   

93
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:35,010
 - Prosecutor.  
- Yes?

94
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:37,820
 Have you heard that Detective Joo In Do is awake? 

95
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:41,020
 People are calling it a miracle. 

96
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:43,990
Detective Joo In Do? Which hospital is he in?

97
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:46,420
 Pardon? You don't remember? 

98
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:49,870
 it's Inseong Hospital, Room 407. 

99
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:35,600
   

100
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:50,240

00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,400
Huh? Prosecutor Kim?

102
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,980
It's me, Hyeong Bin. Cha Hyeong Bin.

103
00:12:55,980 --> 00:13:01,270
Oh... is this the afterlife?

104
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:05,980
Or are you a ghost?

I'm not in the mood to joke around.

106
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:17,680
- In Do. 
 - Oh, stop it already!

107
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:20,420
What happened with the Hwaseong serial murder case?

108
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:22,990
He was caught.

109
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:27,170
Then, what about Gong Ji Cheol? What happened to him?

110
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:29,170
Gong Ji Cheol?

111
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:35,690
He was executed years ago! I said stop!

112
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:43,180
     

113
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:45,660
2021...

114
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:52,850
In Do, you know what happened to me, don't you?

115
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:55,650
Detective Cha die—...

116
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:08,670
Wait, then what's the name of the bookstore where your fiancée worked?

117
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:12,160
What is it?

118
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:14,720
Old Future.

119
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,700
In Do, do you have cab fare?

120
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:30,760
Seriously, what are you? Who are you! Ouch!

121
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,270
Where are you going?

122
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:12,830
Oh, Cheonggyecheon.

123
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:15,110
Please put on your seat belt.

124
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:26,160
Wait a minute.

125
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:41,300
   

126
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:48,980
   

127
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:26,280
   

128
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,220
Open it.

129
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:47,620
Read it.

130
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:48,650
     

131
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:57,420
Who's Seong Ha?

132
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:59,970
Seo Seong Ha.

133
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:02,610
My only little brother.

134
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:06,710
When I first saw you at the closed school, you reminded me of him.

135
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:10,480
He also died because of Kim Soo Hyeok.

136
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:16,190
That letter... he wrote it a week before he committed suicide.

137
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:21,730
Count how many times he wrote that he wants to live.

138
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:24,480
Three hundred thirty-two times...

139
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:28,200
That bastard Kim So Hyeok...
  

140
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:34,160
He never killed anyone, but he put him in jail for murder.

141
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:38,920
I don't have to talk about Kim Soo Hyeok anymore, do I?

142
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:42,180
You've heard so much about him, you must be sick and tired of it.

143
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:46,030
Once you enter the house today, Kim Soo Hyeok will never be able to touch you.

144
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:52,270
That punk who put the bullet in your head, he's on borrowed time while I'm alive.

145
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:53,930
Also,

146
00:17:56,490 --> 00:17:59,080
that's the reason I saved you.

147
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:03,630
So... what do I have to do now?

148
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:07,380
Just be. At that house.

149
00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:34,120
Stabbing with a knife isn't the only revenge. Do it with words, it hurts more.

150
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:38,930
You're not a member of this family. You're my family who you share meals with.

151
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:42,740
Don't forget. You have everything.

152
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:47,620
Nice house, money, brain, résumé, looks.

153
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:53,130
You have to have everything. Have it all. You're the owner of this house. Got it?

154
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:56,140
Oh, also, I picked me up a reporter.

155
00:18:56,140 --> 00:19:00,440
Cheon Seok Tae won't be able to treat you however he wants.

156
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:05,630
Pick up. Not pick me up.

157
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:13,810
According to the doctor, your subconscious remembers everything.

158
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:16,280
If you can't remember, kid,

159
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:19,820
just follow your instincts.

160
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:31,690
   

161
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:37,660
- Yes? 
  - Chief Prosecutor Cheon Seok Tae? 

162
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:40,600
Who's this? How did you get my number?

163
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,600
 This is Reporter Na Eun Seong from Jeil Daily. 

164
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:45,280
 We received a tip recently. 

165
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:50,520
 I hear your son is fighting for his life after getting shot by a gang. Is that true? 

166
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:53,770
 The news is already going around the media. 

167
00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:59,090
 Honorable father and hopeless son, Cheon Seok Tae, who's about to be appointed Attorney General. 

168
00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:05,150
If you want to keep your job as a reporter, don't write presumptuous nonsense based on groundless rumors.

169
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:08,550
Learn how to confirm the facts first.

170
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:15,240
Where is this punk?

171
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,720
Mom! He's home.

172
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,280
Wasn't he in the U.S.?

173
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:54,250
 Your subconscious remembers everything. 

174
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:58,950
 If you can't remember, just follow your instincts. 

175
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:36,540
Jong Beom...

176
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,500
How did you get here?

177
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:54,330
You didn't even go to the U.S. Where have you been living?

178
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:59,740
I've been well. I'm healthy now.

179
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:23,060
 You've been living as the son of a wealthy family for 23 years. 

180
00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:37,990
Have your eating habits changed, too?

181
00:22:38,910 --> 00:22:42,970
Jong Beom, you didn't even like the smell of cucumbers.

182
00:22:44,050 --> 00:22:47,120
What's going on with his school?

183
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:51,530
It was processed as him being in the U.S. as an exchange student.

184
00:22:51,530 --> 00:22:55,590
You can go back to school normally starting next week.

185
00:22:56,650 --> 00:23:02,380
Jong Beom, you know your father is getting appointed Attorney General next week.

186
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:06,720
Since Jong Beom is here, let's take a family portrait.

187
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,560
We're a perfect family now.

188
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:15,150
Even if you don't want to do it, pretend. We'll be doing family interviews, too.

189
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:19,180
Yes, Father.

190
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:25,420
Make a credit card for Jong Beom. Don't let him work part-time.

191
00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:31,920
And for the next month, we have to all be on alert as a family.

192
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:35,870
Jong Woo, you be nice to your brother, too.

193
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:47,380
Jong Woo, you don't need to study abroad anymore. The TOEFL's too hard anyway.

194
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:51,170
It's too hard to score above 80.

195
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:56,640
I can learn English from Jong Beom.

196
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,920
I can do that, right?

197
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:03,080
You... are probably better at it than me.

198
00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:09,410
Jong Beom, let's get you a car, too.

199
00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:11,640
Don't ride scooters anymore.

200
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:14,920
I’ve always disliked that.

201
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:17,250
Okay. I'll do that.

202
00:24:33,450 --> 00:24:37,220
Jong Beom, let's have a talk alone.

203
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:55,890
Tell me where you've been all this time and with whom.

204
00:24:55,890 --> 00:24:58,360
I can't remember.

205
00:25:00,010 --> 00:25:04,920
Prosecutor Kim Soo Hyeok, even after getting suspended for the firearm incident,

206
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:07,660
he's been tracking you down.

207
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:12,280
Your mom said you went to the U.S., but there was no record of you leaving the country.

208
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:18,190
Where were you and with whom?!

209
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:21,320
Even if I remembered, I don't feel like telling you.

210
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:24,400
Since you're scaring me by screaming like that.

211
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,010
Do you remember this then?

212
00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:41,600
You can leave.

213
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,940
I have somewhere I need to go.

214
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:45,900
Right now, you...

215
00:25:50,010 --> 00:25:54,500
Fine. I'll tell the driver, so go.

216
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,870
Where should I take you?

217
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:16,900
Old Future.

218
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:18,830
Pardon?

219
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:23,090
Cheonggyecheon's old bookstore.

220
00:26:23,090 --> 00:26:25,150
Oh, Cheonggyecheon.

221
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:30,500
Please stop the car.

222
00:26:47,170 --> 00:26:53,550
   

223
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:32,890


224
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:40,790
♫   Exhausted by bird sounds all night,   ♫

225
00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:41,610
   

226
00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:42,930
♫   Will the single leaf fall   ♫

227
00:27:42,930 --> 00:27:45,890
 The picture is what connects 1987 and the present. 

228
00:27:45,890 --> 00:27:48,140
 Have you been reincarnated, too? 

229
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:49,690
 It's been a while, Gong Ji Cheol. 

230
00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:53,100
 I'll forgive you for everything. I feel like it was all because of me. 

231
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:54,050
 How did you survive? 

232
00:27:54,050 --> 00:27:56,520
 I didn't get to tell her that I love her. 

233
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:58,540
 Do you still suspect him? 

234
00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:01,760
 Cha Hyeong Bin, why can't you recognize me? 

235
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,750
 We're going to be together from now on. 

236
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:07,450
 It's not over yet. I have to make him admit to his own sin. 

237
00:28:07,450 --> 00:28:10,200
 Today is the day you die twice.
