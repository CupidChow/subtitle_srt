1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:03,870
   

2
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:03,790
This...

3
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:12,540
How is this here...

4
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:25,520
   

5
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,480
 The number you dialed cannot be reached... 

6
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:35,510
 The number you dialed cannot be reached... 

7
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:39,990
 The painting that Gong Ji Cheol painted is hanging here. 

8
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:43,150
 It's the painting he did after he killed the girl. 

9
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:48,500
Please bring Inseong Foundation's accounting files.

10
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,120
Why isn't he checking his phone?

11
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:32,390
It's quite beautiful, isn't it?

12
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:03,520
I didn't even invite you but you came.

13
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,820
Wasn't this the invitation?

14
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,510
Try reporting it if you want.

15
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:15,990
The one captured on the security camera at the entrance is probably you.

16
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:20,230
Well, even if I was captured on it, you'll probably become the suspect anyway.

17
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:36,080
   

18
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:42,150
   

19
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:55,700
Police station? There's someone dying here.

20
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:58,990
I'm in front of the Eternity Gallery at the Gangsong-ro intersection.

21
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:06,300
   

22
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,280
 The number you dialed cannot be reached... 

23
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:21,470
   

24
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:26,230
- Yeah? 
  - Prosecutor, Detective Joo's been stabbed all over 

25
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:29,550
 and he was discovered at a gallery near the Gangsong-ro intersection.  

26
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:12,430
He was severely injured in the chest and abdomen,

27
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:15,770
and during surgery, he went into shock.

28
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:20,910
Right now, it's difficult to determine when he will regain consciousness. Are you a family member?

29
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:22,940
I'm not.

30
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:25,190
Please contact his family.

31
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:28,660
They may need to prepare for the worst.

32
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:39,520
   

33
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:45,040
 Stabbing, my butt. 

34
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:50,980
  You know nothing about goose fathers. A goose father has to survive until the end no matter what. 

35
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:53,920
 I won't die that easily! 

36
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:32,320
 The painting that Gong Ji Cheol painted is hanging here. 

37
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:35,610
 It's the painting he did after killing the girl. 

38
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:13,680
I'll send you the address. Check the security cameras in the gallery and the nearby area.

39
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:20,270
 Is Jeong Sa Bin one of your people? 

40
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:56,950
Why didn't you pick up your phone? You've never been like this before.

41
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:05,770
Today was so long.

42
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:10,790
It was long for me, too. Should we have something strong to drink?

43
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:14,300
Don't drink. You have to drive.

44
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:17,550
I'm going to sleep here.

45
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:34,800
Sang Ah, let's break off our engagement.

46
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,980
What? Is it because of my hysteria?

47
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:39,780
Because I can't be like other women?

48
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:42,630
There's someone I want to protect.

49
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:45,490
I'm someone with clear affiliations.

50
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:50,010
If I don't belong to her, I can't protect her.

51
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:52,510
Who is this person?

52
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:57,480
Is it the woman who you risked your life for twice?

53
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:03,650
Do you love that woman?

54
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:08,880
Tell me. I want to know how you feel.

55
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:23,240
When I'm with that woman, I keep looking at her face.

56
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:27,490
There's never been a time where I couldn't control myself.

57
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:31,590
But when I'm with her, I can't control myself.

58
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:39,270
I think of her all day. What is she doing?

59
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:44,550
Is she going to get hurt? Is anything wrong with her?

60
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:50,900
Even while working, I want to run out to find her.

61
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:53,640
I suddenly think of what my mom told me.

62
00:10:54,770 --> 00:10:59,550
For Frida Kahlo, her lover Diego

63
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:06,280
became her son and her flesh and blood

64
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:10,790
and her lover and her husband

65
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:14,710
and her father and her sun

66
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:19,060
and her heaven and her hell!

67
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:23,710
Is that woman that to you? Has it gone that far?

68
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:26,900
Tell me!

69
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:36,550
Right now, I'm not sure.

70
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:40,160
But my feelings for her have made me realize

71
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:45,420
that I've never once loved you.

72
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:53,040
I can now see why I've always suffered from horrible imaginations while loving you.

73
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,400
It'll change.

74
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:04,940
Just like your feelings for me changed. Your feelings for that woman will change, too.

75
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:06,700
Sang Ah,

76
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:13,660
when I proposed to you, I saw her.

77
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:21,000
That proposal was for her.

78
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,830
What?

79
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:25,830
I'll take you home.

80
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:17,870
That... Why couldn't that be me?

81
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:32,860
Right. Oh! Look at me. I didn't say goodbye to the nurse.

82
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:37,960
I thought she was just pretty but she was Nightingale!

83
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:41,550
Wait a second. Wait.

84
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,550
It's a relief that you're fine.

85
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:08,650
Was it really you who tried to kill Prosecutor Kim Soo Hyeok?

86
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,500
I'm asking you.

87
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,050
Yes.

88
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:28,030
Why? Because he was chasing you and suspecting you, you wanted to kill him?

89
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:33,170
- Because I love you. 
 - What?

90
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:37,080
Because he was someone who made you suffer, I wanted to kill him.

91
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:42,930
He's the person who won't let me into your heart, so I had to kill him.

92
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:45,350
That...

93
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:50,420
If you ask me to explain, I can't.

94
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:56,680
This is the first time I've wanted to kill someone because I came to love someone.

95
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,760
I'll be going.

96
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,950
Next time,

97
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:12,160
if there's something you want to know, ask me directly instead of sneaking a peek.

98
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:16,100
What that person likes to eat, what that person's scared of.

99
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:21,400
Don't ever lie to someone you love.

100
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:26,020
If you're curious where the person you love is, ask them where they are.

101
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:30,340
Next time, don't smile when you don't mean it.

102
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:34,850
Don't live as someone you are not in front of others.

103
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:43,170
From now on, if you have thoughts of wanting to kill someone,

104
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:46,180
think of me instead.

105
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:50,320
You're good at drawing.

106
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:56,590
Imagine my face on top of the person who you want to kill.

107
00:15:57,780 --> 00:16:00,620
If you still want to kill them,

108
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:03,400
think of that bloody hand that stabbed me as your own.

109
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:08,620
Think about how it would feel to stab me. If you can still kill them...

110
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:26,940
 I regretted it. 

111
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,770
 Because I thought I wouldn't see you again. 

112
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:57,950
- Please take good care of her! 
 - Yes!

113
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:02,030
You're cool, Jong Beom!

114
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:05,370
   

115
00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:25,410
It's that woman. That woman keeps stealing what belongs to your master.

116
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,140
What should we do with her?

117
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,140
 You will end up killing the person you love. 

118
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:48,030
 Isn't it about time we meet? 

119
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:54,090
 I'll come to you. 

120
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:48,680
I knew you wouldn't report me. I wouldn't have done it either.

121
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:53,870
We're really similar. You can acknowledge that now, right?

122
00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:57,540
Why didn't you come with Prosecutor Kim Soo Hyeok today?

123
00:18:57,540 --> 00:19:01,190
With your wedding so close, are you each enjoying your time alone?

124
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:03,860
   

125
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,240
- I want to ask you something. 
 - Anything.

126
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:15,260
Why did you send me texts as Gong Ji Cheol? Another thing. Why did you get me falsely charged for murder?

127
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:21,500
That's something you should ask my mom, I mean, writer Jang Hye Mi.

128
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:25,980
Writer Jang Hye Mi has known you so much longer than I have.

129
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:32,770
No, maybe the right way to say it is that she's been watching you since before you were born.

130
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:36,230
Me? Why?

131
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:40,810
If I tell you everything, will you take that photo to the police?

132
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:45,830
Find out for yourself why writer Jang Hye Mi has an interest in you.

133
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:50,530
Then I'll ask you something you can answer. Why did you install a camera in my room?

134
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:52,170
Aren't you the same?

135
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:57,020
When you want to be friends with someone, you want to take a peek secretly.

136
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:59,870
Deep into their secrets,

137
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:03,100
so that you can have that person

138
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:05,190
- completely. 
 - Friends?

139
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:10,120
I'm sure you need a friend, too. A very special one.

140
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,650
Aren't you lonely?

141
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:23,000
I'm grateful.

142
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:28,580
For making me realize how unnerving and dirty someone peeking secretly feels.

143
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:35,840
The video of your murder will soon be handed over to the police. Before that, the questions I asked you,

144
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:39,470
come see me after you get the answers directly from writer Jang Hye Mi.

145
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:43,530
I'm sure you'll need time for the conversation with your mom.

146
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:45,780
I'll give you one day.

147
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:54,370
Also... you become friends when you have an interest.

148
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:56,850
I have no interest in you.

149
00:20:56,850 --> 00:21:01,230
I can kill the woman you love right away.

150
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:08,160
What will you do? I know who the woman in your picture is.

151
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:18,740
You won't be able to do it. You're afraid of dying. By my hands.

152
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:38,550
   

153
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:45,830
 If you're curious where the person you love is, ask them where they are. 

154
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:54,630
Where are you right now?

155
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:57,430
Me? I'm on my way to the bookstore.

156
00:21:57,430 --> 00:22:00,540
I'll be there. There's a book I want too...

157
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:05,650
 Don't ever lie to someone you love. 

158
00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:09,670
I miss you. I'll come.

159
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:13,490
Hey, you must be bored. You're going to come here?

160
00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:18,010
It might be a little difficult to find, but okay, I'll send you the address.

161
00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:21,150
There are a lot of fun books here. Bring some snacks when you come.

162
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:23,490
What flavor do you like?

163
00:22:23,490 --> 00:22:26,250
Today, I feel like honeycomb toffee.

164
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,270
   

165
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:42,680
   

166
00:22:44,090 --> 00:22:46,060
   

167
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:51,100
   

168
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:55,710
   

169
00:22:58,850 --> 00:23:01,360

171
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:13,760
    

172
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:45,550
 I like you. I like you, 

173
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:48,310
 so you can never get hurt. 

174
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:07,260
Is anyone here?

175
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:09,410
Where did he go?

176
00:24:34,650 --> 00:24:36,530
You're here quick.

177
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:43,720
How did you come here?

178
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:48,370
I didn't call for you.

179
00:24:48,370 --> 00:24:51,960
Whether it's because I'm indebted to you for saving my life,

180
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:56,650
or because of the protective instinct I got while saving you that I'm like this...

181
00:24:56,650 --> 00:24:58,190
Pardon?

182
00:24:59,270 --> 00:25:02,670
But can I do an experiment, too?

183
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:05,120
What kind of an experiment?

184
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:18,300
♫   Your eyes looking at me   ♫

185
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:23,920
♫   somehow look sad   ♫

186
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:32,040
♫   When I look at you, the whole world   ♫

187
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:38,130
♫   seems to have stopped while filled with you   ♫

188
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:46,910
♫   Even if someday a difficult time comes for us   ♫

189
00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:51,920
♫   I will not leave   ♫

 Are you saying Prosecutor Kim likes you? 

195
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:52,950
 I was curious what kind of expression you'd have in front of someone you like. 

196
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:55,030
 I need to protect you. 

197
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:56,680
 I'm thinking about being friends with you. 

198
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:59,290
 He wants to get away this time, too? She's my woman now. 

199
00:26:59,290 --> 00:27:02,570
 I've never liked someone this much before. 

200
00:27:02,570 --> 00:27:03,850
 Take responsibility. 

201
00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:06,110
 Will I be able to have that woman? 

202
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:07,940
 Sa Bin has a stalker. 

203
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:09,010
 That person was after you. 

204
00:27:09,010 --> 00:27:10,880
 Death is the only means of total possession. 

205
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:14,700
 Once I decide to kill someone, I never give up.
