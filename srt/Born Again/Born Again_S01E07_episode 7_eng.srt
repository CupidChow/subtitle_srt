1
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:49,120
   
 Someone is hurt, please come quickly. 

2
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,140
 He's bleeding... He's bleeding... 

3
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:55,870
 He's... He's dying. 

4
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,330
 At that moment... 

5
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:07,580
 I started to see his blood... 

6
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:18,360


7
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:21,830
   

8
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:31,550
I've felt this since the excavation at Donggang, but haven't we met before somewhere?

9
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:37,010
At 9:33 a.m. last Monday, I saw you being held hostage by someone in Mapo.

10
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:40,010
In Mapo? Me?

11
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:47,820
Oh, I wasn't being held hostage. I was negotiating with the captor.

12
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:50,310
It looked like you were about to die.

13
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:52,020
About to...

14
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:56,550
So you just passed by after seeing something like that? As a prosecutor?

15
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:58,880
I didn't have time then.

16
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:01,550
And I also don't have time now.

17
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:04,950
Still, let's at least introduce ourselves.

18
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:07,600
I'm Jeong Sa Bin, Prosecutor Kim Soo Hyeok.

19
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,480
I'll keep that in mind, Ms. Jeong Sa Bin.

20
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:15,130
Oh, that formaldehyde face...

21
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:25,080
Over there, put on a lab coat in the changing room and disinfect your hands.

22
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:29,610
- The autopsy room is inside. I'll be waiting. 
 - Okay.

23
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:35,520
Who is that?

24
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,530
Oh, my heart...

25
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:44,430
- Who is that? 
 - What?

26
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:49,300
Oh, he's my student from the university where I work. He's here today as my daily trainee.

27
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:55,290
Student?

28
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:39,230
This is the mummy that became a skeleton overnight.

29
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:42,390
I wonder what he looked like when he was alive.

30
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:47,770
He's handsome according to his skeleton. About 184 cm in height?

31
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:53,190
His shoulders are as wide as a swimmer's. I'm not sure what his facial features were like.

32
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:55,540
Do you want the backstory?

33
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:57,960
- Mr. Lee Bo So is—
 - Lee Bo So?

34
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,440
It's Mr. Donggang mummy's nickname.

35
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:05,250
Mr. Lee Bo So passed away

36
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:09,090
on his way to the wedding hall with a ring for his bride.

37
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:25,430
Are you... okay?

38
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,790
Oh...

39
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:33,460
Professor Lee, isn't today's autopsy closed to the public?

40
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:38,030
Oh, I invited him. Medically, the Donggang mummy is an exceptional case.

41
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:41,980
It's the remains of a person in an open case. How can an ordinary citizen be allowed in?

42
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:46,840
An intern has three chances to participate. We'll make sure to have you back next time.

43
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,810
I'm sorry.

44
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:54,320
Can I not watch from over there?

45
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:04,820
- Please leave. 
 - Very well.

46
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:44,720
Let's do this. Make this a woman who Byeon Seong Hoon killed 10 years ago.

47
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:49,130
Retain the thoracic and abdominal puncture, and say that the skull couldn't be restored because it was shattered.

48
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:51,810
Pardon? What are you...

49
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:55,310
It's an unidentified person's remains. We need to use it to our advantage.

50
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:58,360
We need to do it in order to put Byeon Seong Hoon away for life.

51
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:01,670
Professor Yoo, you can testify at his trial. Right?

52
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:04,520
- Pardon? 
- It won't be possible.

53
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:08,500
Our team's goal is to use 3D to reconstruct those who have been discovered and identify them.

54
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:12,170
The families of these remains still believe they're missing.

55
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:20,190
Weren't you already in the same boat as me?

56
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:23,940
- That is... 
 - You want to manipulate the remains?

57
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:28,780
How can you insult the remains this way? Do you want to go to jail for damaging them?

58
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,280
Jail?

59
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:35,230
What's the reason Lee Bo So met me after death? He wants me to reveal the unfair cause of his death.

60
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:37,600
He wants me to take him to those whom he loved!

61
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:42,550
Lee Bo So or Jeo Bo So, those close to him would have given up waiting for him after 30 years.

62
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:46,190
Professor, please get a signed confidentiality agreement from this person.

63
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:49,010
- I'm a forensic scientist, not "this person." 
 - Oh.

64
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:53,240
- Please make sure Ms. Jeong Sa Bin keeps it under wraps. 
 - I said I'm a forensic scientist.

65
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:58,040
Whatever. Fine, Mr. Kim Soo Hyeok.

66
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:04,300
Please send over the results of the autopsy only to me, and prepare for trial. I'll get going.

67
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:11,590
I guess I'm not worth listening to.

68
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:15,200
Well, fine. Please give me back Lee Bo So's ring and book.

69
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,660
They're articles left by the deceased.

70
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:23,710
If you haven't already, take this opportunity and read it once.

71
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:27,530
Seriously...

72
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:37,250
   

73
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:04,270
Even the year of publication has been erased.

74
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,980
What is this?

75
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:11,770
Looks like a stamp.

76
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:14,720
Maybe a bookstore stamp?

77
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:34,290
"If all else perished, and he remained,

78
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:36,800
I should still continue to be.

79
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:40,560
Whatever our souls are made of,

80
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:44,760
his and mine are the same.

81
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:48,300
He's more myself than I am."

82
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:14,580
- What are you doing? 
- That's the question I want to ask you.

83
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:23,980
Wh-What? You threw this book away to me.

84
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:59,470
Take it then. How can you take back what you gave? Formaldehyde is so fickle.

85
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,760
Let me have that fountain pen. It's mine.

86
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,340
Oh...

87
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:16,710
Let me give you a piece of advice.

88
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:19,410
From now on, even if someone is killing someone, just keep walking.

89
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:21,940
Or you'll end up dying.

90
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:25,780
He has an odd way of showing concern.

91
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:32,860
That jerk... Seriously...

92
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:39,510
To formaldehyde? Me?

93
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:45,030
That surprised me.

94
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:48,440
Sorry that you had to wait so long. Where are you?

95
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,240
 I'm in front of the autopsy room right now. 

96
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,860
But I think I dropped my fountain pen there.

97
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:55,740
Could you bring it for me?

98
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:59,360
 Why is everyone asking about fountain pens today? 

99
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:21,450
Fountain pen... Fountain pen.

100
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:25,700
Where is the fountain pen?

101
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,640
Here it is.

102
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:47,940
 Let's do this. Make this a woman who Byeon Seong Hoon killed 10 years ago. 

103
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:52,830
 Retain the thoracic and abdominal puncture, and say that the skull couldn't be restored because it was shattered. 

104
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:55,160
 Pardon? What are you... 

105
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:58,560
 It's an unidentified person's remains. We need to use it to our advantage. 

106
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,640
 We need to do it in order to put Byeon Seong Hoon away for life. 

107
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:05,590
 Professor Yoo, you can testify at his trial. Right? 

108
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:08,500
   

109
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,630
    

110
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:39,450
Hi.

111
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:51,450
I deposited the payment to your account. Thanks every time.

112
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:58,520
None of the ice is melted. How sweet.

113
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:07,320
Sweetie, wait.

114
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:12,600
Do you want to have a drink with me?

115
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:19,430
I'll pay you three months' worth of wages in one shot.

116
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:24,970
I'm getting married in a week, and I'd like to have my bachelorette party with you.

117
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:31,190
I'll decide on the place. Just two hours at the location.

118
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:34,350
Okay. Wait here.

119
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:56,700
I'm sorry. I know how busy you are.

120
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:05,740
You don't need to speak so formally to me now, Mother-in-Law.

121
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:10,610
I'll drop the honorifics when you and Sang Ah get married.

122
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:13,790
We aren't family just yet.

123
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:21,820
- I'll have a flat white.
 - Yes, Ma'am.

124
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:28,390
   

125
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:31,030
The second edition is out already?

126
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:36,490
But do people need to know the murderer's secrets, too?

127
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:40,900
I'm sure people aren't born murderers.

128
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:47,340
A cobra is born, not raised.

129
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:52,840
If you don't cut the head off before it raises its head, it will carry poison.

130
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:58,440
You're aware that the book's main character is Gong Ji Cheol, don't you?

131
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,890
Gong Ji Cheol?

132
00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:02,460
Pretending not to know...

133
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:06,320
Director Cheon Seok Tae will gnash his teeth over anything to do with Gong Ji Cheol.

134
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:11,230
You and Director Cheon are close, aren't you?

135
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:16,020
Director Cheon is your target today, too.

136
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:21,450
I've always been curious about the nature of your relationship with the director.

137
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:26,190
And? What kind of relationship do you think it is?

138
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:29,350
I'll wait until you tell me yourself.

139
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:47,930
You know something?

140
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:52,710
Director Cheon has a headache of a son.

141
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:53,590
And?

142
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:56,320
It's ironic.

143
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:59,190
The great Director Cheon who so easily sends murderers to the gallows

144
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:03,560
has a son who is a juvenile delinquent.

145
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:06,730
It's a peculiar twist.

146
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:12,340
Director Cheon's wife opted for donated sperm thinking her husband suffered from aspermia.

147
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:15,020
She must have received a bad seed.

148
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:22,980
Mother-in-Law, the way you keep giving me all kinds of information,

149
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:28,710
you must want me to act on it, but don't try to control me.

150
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:31,790
I'm not a pushover, and I'm also uncouth.

151
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:34,690
I don't play games others have set out for me.

152
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:41,390
I'm aware... that you play with warrants.

153
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:45,180
But Prosecutor Kim,

154
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:51,380
you loathe people who are diseased in here.

155
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:57,660
Director Cheon's son is just such a person.

156
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:01,290
The kind you loathe the most.

157
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:15,840
 I saw him when he was young. 

158
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:19,610
 His name was... like that. 

159
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:25,610
 Knowing Director Cheon's personality, I'm sure he gave his son a new identity. 

160
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:38,920
"Case of a female student from Somang Alternative School who was missing for 40 days.

161
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:42,130
Somang Alternative School, Kim Jeong Eun, age 18.

162
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:46,200
Killed in a fire after being confined."

163
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:50,120
"The mutilation murder case of a student from Onjin Elementary School.

164
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:52,700
Onjin Elementary School, Eom Yoon Hee, age 12...

165
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,730
Addicted to games.

166
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:59,010
Kidnapped an elementary student with an accomplice and killed and mutilated her..."

167
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:01,600
"A peer group..."

168
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,800
"Video of sexual assault."

169
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:15,000
"Murdered a female junior-high student and abandoned her corpse. Cheon Eun Woo, age 15.

170

171

A boy who spent three days with a corpse..."

172
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:26,350
   

173
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:31,590
I think I've seen him somewhere...

174
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:53,530
You have to empty out all the bottles in this store tonight, okay?

175
00:20:53,530 --> 00:20:56,320
That's the only way I'll pay you for the job.

176
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:04,700
You want to make money, huh?

177
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:10,180
With your looks, there's a place where you can earn ₩10,000,000  (about $8,200)  just by sitting there.

178
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:15,840
Money? I do this part-time work because I like it.

179
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,770
Why do you like running errands?

180
00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:20,330
Since no one pays me any attention.

181
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:24,200
You're an oddity.

182
00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:41,390
Can you just... listen to me?

183
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:44,380
- That's why I came. 
 - Huh?

184
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,860
That's the last drink.

185
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:56,450
Go ahead and tell me.

186
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:02,280
A young kid like you... You make me want to drink more.

187
00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:26,410
A kid who holds a memory of a murder, Cheon Eun Woo.

188
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:29,460
   

189
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:58,290


190
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:19,990
What's the matter, Director?

191
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:24,820
This morning, a murder occurred at Pureun Studio Apartments.

192
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:27,500
I'd like you to be in charge of it, Soo Hyeok.

193
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,190
I'm working on Byeon Seong Hoon's case right now—

194
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:32,430
There was a murderer on another level from Byeon Seong Hoon.

195
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:36,530
He died 30 years ago.

196
00:23:36,530 --> 00:23:39,230
I got him the death penalty.

197
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:44,450
But a copycat has appeared.

198
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:46,180
Are you talking about Gong Ji Cheol?

199
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:53,350
Rumors of you manipulating the remains in Byeon Seong Hoon's case are spreading around the prosecutor's office. I'll cover it up.

200
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:57,630
In return, take the Pureun Studio Apartments case.

201
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:03,140
I'll give you a detective who knows Gong Ji Cheol well.

202
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:14,930
   

203
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:26,550
 The victim's name and the murder date were written on a yellow umbrella. 

204
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:29,480
 That's Gong Ji Cheol's signature. 

205
00:24:32,990 --> 00:24:36,740
You can't touch the crime scene haphazardly, Sir.

206
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:48,540
I saw this 32 years ago at a crime scene inspection.

207
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:51,050
It's the same as the one from 32 years ago.

208
00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:53,820
That punk killed the same way.

209
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:04,320
Cha... Detective Cha Hyeong Bin?

210
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:08,660
Aren't you Detective Cha? Detective Cha!

211
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:10,480
But there's no way you could be.

212
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,680
Stop it.

213
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:15,050
You're not even a doppelgänger.

214
00:25:15,050 --> 00:25:16,890
How can you look exactly the same?

215
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:20,370
Did you drink before coming to do the crime scene inspection?

216
00:25:20,370 --> 00:25:22,600
Do you take preservatives?

217
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:27,300
Is it some kind of a bio... cryogenics or something?

218
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:29,070
Detective Cha!

219
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:31,750
I'm Prosecutor Kim Soo Hyeok!

220
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:34,140
Kim Soo Hyeok?

221
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:36,590
How can this be possible?

222
00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:41,050
Even your voice is the same.

223
00:25:41,050 --> 00:25:45,190
Start by interviewing the doorman and the neighbors next door and above and below.

224
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:52,420
How he takes off by himself is exactly the same, too.

225
00:26:10,690 --> 00:26:12,900
The time of the murder is around 1:00 a.m.

226
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:15,150
There's a scar on the neck.

227
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:18,430
I think she got the tattoo to cover a surgical scar.

228
00:26:18,430 --> 00:26:21,970
From the location, it looks like a thyroid operation.

229
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:25,220
Surgical scar...

230
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:27,620
Hey. Oh...

231
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:38,830
The victim worked at a hostess bar.

232
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:42,340
The lady who lives next door and works at the same bar said

233
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:48,460
there was a medical-school student who came by often running errands as part-time work.

234
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:54,400
If he does part-time work doing errands, we should be able to track his cell phone.

235
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:57,700
Please check the security cameras at the maintenance office first.

236
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:02,500
Going off on his own...

237
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:11,440
It's an old building, so the maintenance has been lax.

238
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:15,690
And we only have security cameras at the parking lot entrance and in the elevator.

239
00:27:15,690 --> 00:27:18,790
Anyone can come into the building without authorization, too.

240
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:23,740
There are only three people who were seen in the elevator around the time of the murder.

241
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:27,690
So other than them, whether there were 10 or 20 people who entered the building,

242
00:27:27,690 --> 00:27:30,940
- you have no way of knowing? 
- You could say that.

243
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:33,970
Have you ever seen the part-time worker who used to go up to #1108?

244
00:27:33,970 --> 00:27:35,270
He would have come almost every day.

245
00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:37,040
I know him well.

246
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:39,330
I think he came here last night as well.

247
00:27:39,330 --> 00:27:41,660
At what time?

248
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:46,080
It was probably around 1:00 a.m.

249
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:52,510
My granddaughter leaves the library around then and always calls me.

250
00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:54,740
 Yeah, hi. 

251
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:57,370
 Be careful on your way home. 

252
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:04,810
 Okay. 

253
00:28:04,810 --> 00:28:06,080
Do you remember his face?

254
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:10,610
Of course, I do.  That student is as handsome as a celebrity.

255
00:28:10,610 --> 00:28:13,130
I remember. He's handsome.

256
00:28:13,130 --> 00:28:15,690
He's also tall.

257
00:28:20,010 --> 00:28:23,080
I'll find your mummy's face for you.

258
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:29,460
Dry bones, hear my words.

259
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:34,810
His face...

260
00:28:34,810 --> 00:28:39,340
Wrap it in muscles, skin, cover it with flesh.

261
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:42,990
Put life into it, and it will come alive.

262
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:46,580
By digitally expanding the tiny bone pieces

263
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:50,470
I'm inputting them into the program. Let's see here.

264
00:28:50,470 --> 00:28:51,930
Cheekbones,

265
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:54,260
and the shape of the jaw like this...

266
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:55,690
I'm going to shave it all down.

267
00:28:55,690 --> 00:28:58,390
Okay, shave it down.

268
00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:03,650
Are these the right eyes?

269
00:29:03,650 --> 00:29:06,420
Did he have double eyelids?

270
00:29:08,210 --> 00:29:12,000
That's it! This is it!

271
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,430
Was this person a celebrity?

272
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:19,310
A gorgeous celebrity in his 20s who disappeared in the 80s...

273
00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:22,860
There was no such person! Do it again.

274
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:25,370
I know! This won't work!

275
00:29:25,370 --> 00:29:27,780
We only have a piece of his skull!

276
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:32,530
You can sort of complete it if you have one side!

277
00:29:32,530 --> 00:29:36,440
Of the 53 pieces, two-thirds are from the left!

278
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:40,580
Let's try again, huh?

279
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:48,430
Go find some more pieces. I can't do it until then!

280
00:29:48,430 --> 00:29:52,150
And please let me sleep!

281
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:54,220
Seriously...

282
00:30:24,610 --> 00:30:26,670
Don't you see the red light?

283
00:30:26,670 --> 00:30:31,740
- Red light?
- For three months, this signal's green light hasn't been working.

284
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:35,850
You're a medical school professor. You don't have red-green color blindness, do you?

285
00:30:35,850 --> 00:30:37,690
The only color I can't see is red.

286
00:30:37,690 --> 00:30:43,110
I can't see blood or organs, so I'm fated to love only the remains.

287
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:45,040
It's turned off.

288
00:30:56,430 --> 00:30:58,290
I have something to ask you.

289
00:30:58,290 --> 00:30:59,720
What is it?

290
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:04,820
If a person's body decays underground, does the earth change color?

291
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:07,100
What?

292
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:11,960
You go to the excavation sites often, so I was curious.

293
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:14,290
About that...

294
00:31:14,290 --> 00:31:18,450
When the body decomposes underground, the surrounding soil does become darker.

295
00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:23,510
In the case of bodies that have been slaughtered with bullets and empty shells, the soil turns yellowish-brown.

296
00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:26,860
But why are you asking such a thing?

297
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:30,520
What about clothes?

298
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:32,660
Clothes don't disintegrate underground?

299
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:35,020
For example, materials like silk—

300
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:37,610
In the case of alkaline earth, silk disintegrates well.

301
00:31:37,610 --> 00:31:41,400
And if the earth is acidic, cotton disintegrates well.

302
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,180
Why?

303
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:46,620
I was curious.

304
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:50,690
Oh right. When does the exhibition for the Andong elder start?

305
00:31:50,690 --> 00:31:53,320
I'm preparing for the exhibition tonight. Do you want me to invite you?

306
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:55,230
You look like you need an extra pair of hands.

307
00:31:55,230 --> 00:31:58,470
I'll go in first. See you in class.

308
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:09,630
That's definitely soil from a hill with high acidity...

309
00:32:28,410 --> 00:32:30,390
What am I doing?
