1
00:01:04,238 --> 00:01:05,531
- Mama Rita...
- What?

2
00:01:05,556 --> 00:01:06,449
The tricycle's here,

3
00:01:06,474 --> 00:01:08,159
- Let's go?
- Oh, yes Ben, wait a bit.

4
00:01:08,184 --> 00:01:09,935
Dear, are we good?

5
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,587
We'll finish up, wait a sec.

6
00:01:12,021 --> 00:01:13,080
Thank you dear.

7
00:01:13,105 --> 00:01:14,398
Is this finished already?

8
00:01:14,398 --> 00:01:15,900
Make sure everything's checked.

9
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:16,942
Brother!

10
00:01:18,303 --> 00:01:19,279
Rita! Come.

11
00:01:19,304 --> 00:01:21,270
Come. Follow me.

12
00:01:21,697 --> 00:01:23,185
- Have a seat.
- Okay.

13
00:01:25,629 --> 00:01:26,720
Just a sec.

14
00:01:26,745 --> 00:01:27,762
Okay.

15
00:01:27,787 --> 00:01:28,829
I'll just sign these.

16
00:01:28,854 --> 00:01:30,264
Where will I sign?

17
00:01:43,795 --> 00:01:45,137
Number two, please!

18
00:01:47,239 --> 00:01:49,158
- Good morning, ma'am!
- Good morning!

19
00:01:49,183 --> 00:01:50,567
Are you making a deposit?

20
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,058
Yes.

21
00:01:52,186 --> 00:01:54,939
I'm really sorry for the delay.

22
00:01:55,479 --> 00:01:59,001
- Oh, Rita...
- I know we're past the retention period.

23
00:01:59,026 --> 00:02:01,388
I already told you
about this, Rita.

24
00:02:01,796 --> 00:02:04,215
If it didn't blow up in your faces,
you guys wouldn't have done something.

25
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,466
It's a good thing you were able
to come up with money,

26
00:02:07,547 --> 00:02:09,772
or else you and Mama Luz'
payment would've gone to waste.

27
00:02:09,797 --> 00:02:12,872
Yes, actually I used up what
little savings I have, and the rest,

28
00:02:12,952 --> 00:02:16,361
I just borrowed from a friend.
Everybody chipped in.

29
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:19,442
Ben and Ana as well.

30
00:02:20,872 --> 00:02:24,708
Well, you know,
the closed-bidding is tomorrow already,

31
00:02:24,993 --> 00:02:30,040
so it's really important that
the money makes it in time.

32
00:02:30,224 --> 00:02:33,144
You're going to
have to pray and wish

33
00:02:33,169 --> 00:02:36,021
that nobody else takes
an interest to the property.

34
00:02:36,622 --> 00:02:39,917
But, I don't think anyone's
interested in our lot.

35
00:02:39,942 --> 00:02:42,247
Well, maybe, we're not sure.

36
00:02:43,059 --> 00:02:44,469
But it is what it is.

37
00:02:45,114 --> 00:02:48,315
The bank doesn't
really care who gets it.

38
00:02:48,451 --> 00:02:52,371
But it's our home, please tell me
no one's gonna take it from us.

39
00:02:52,396 --> 00:02:56,935
We'll see, I can't promise anything.

40
00:02:57,001 --> 00:02:58,942
- Here you go.
- There, very good.

41
00:03:00,463 --> 00:03:04,130
Remember, the closed bidding
is due the next day.

42
00:03:04,275 --> 00:03:06,902
It's important that no more delays
are going to happen,

43
00:03:06,927 --> 00:03:09,489
the bank will call you

44
00:03:09,584 --> 00:03:13,810
and from there you'll know
if you've won or lost the bidding.

45
00:03:15,005 --> 00:03:16,325
How does it work?

46
00:03:16,455 --> 00:03:18,403
What if we win the bidding?

47
00:03:18,606 --> 00:03:20,524
What will happen if we lose?

48
00:03:20,658 --> 00:03:21,843
Okay, listen.

49
00:03:23,053 --> 00:03:27,239
If you win the bidding,
the property is yours.

50
00:03:27,349 --> 00:03:31,591
But if you lose, it only means

51
00:03:31,702 --> 00:03:34,981
that somebody else
placed a higher bid.

52
00:03:35,193 --> 00:03:38,217
And the property is theirs.

53
00:03:38,242 --> 00:03:42,645
I hope it doesn't
come to that.

54
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:46,675
Yeah, like I said, all you can
really do at this point is pray.

55
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:49,412
But don't worry,
I feel good about this.

56
00:03:49,437 --> 00:03:50,670
Alright then.

57
00:03:50,919 --> 00:03:52,837
Thank you so much!

58
00:03:52,907 --> 00:03:54,867
Alright, I'll try my best.

59
00:03:54,892 --> 00:03:56,977
Let me see what I can do, okay?

60
00:04:06,137 --> 00:04:08,448
- See you later?
- Yeah, later.

61
00:04:08,473 --> 00:04:09,557
I'll call you.

62
00:04:10,174 --> 00:04:11,749
- I love you.
- I love you.

63
00:04:33,303 --> 00:04:35,613
That's too early, Ron.

64
00:04:35,638 --> 00:04:36,758
Yeah and I'm already losing.

65
00:04:41,463 --> 00:04:43,500
Let's see if your luck holds out today.

66
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:49,523
- Who did you bet on?
- Black.

67
00:04:51,609 --> 00:04:53,374
Wrong choice, man.

68
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:55,201
Maybe they bounce back?

69
00:04:56,758 --> 00:04:58,485
Idiot!

70
00:04:59,258 --> 00:05:00,708
You're an idiot, Ron.

71
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,751
Ben, you jinxed me.

72
00:05:05,308 --> 00:05:06,820
Housekeeping!

73
00:05:09,953 --> 00:05:10,976
Hey Mara,

74
00:05:11,179 --> 00:05:13,074
do you know of any more
job vacancies?

75
00:05:13,147 --> 00:05:16,672
Aren't you content
with our work in here?

76
00:05:16,706 --> 00:05:19,094
I need to earn more money.

77
00:05:19,498 --> 00:05:21,200
I'd even take a graveyard shift.

78
00:05:23,641 --> 00:05:24,901
Graveyard?

79
00:05:25,537 --> 00:05:26,830
How about as a prostitute?

80
00:05:26,953 --> 00:05:29,542
You'll only have
to spread your legs.

81
00:05:30,065 --> 00:05:32,086
Not like that!

82
00:05:32,646 --> 00:05:36,375
Somewhere open 24-hours,
like an eatery.

83
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,789
Wait, really?

84
00:05:38,305 --> 00:05:41,235
You'd trade what we're doing
here for an eatery?

85
00:05:45,091 --> 00:05:47,885
Make sure everything's loaded
for delivery, okay?

86
00:05:48,044 --> 00:05:49,375
Count everything.

87
00:05:51,485 --> 00:05:52,593
Hey, Ben!

88
00:05:52,859 --> 00:05:53,878
Ben, come here!

89
00:05:53,903 --> 00:05:54,781
Boss!

90
00:05:55,054 --> 00:05:56,305
How many crates have you done?

91
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:01,786
Boss, I'm almost at eighty.

92
00:06:02,244 --> 00:06:03,370
- Eighty?
- Yes.

93
00:06:03,395 --> 00:06:05,750
- Will you finish by 4 PM?
- Yes, boss!

94
00:06:06,005 --> 00:06:07,298
Yeah, I got this!

95
00:06:07,352 --> 00:06:09,104
- You better be sure.
- Yes.

96
00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:11,417
Hey, how's that issue
with Ana going?

97
00:06:12,156 --> 00:06:15,880
I hope you gave her the money
you asked of me?

98
00:06:16,422 --> 00:06:17,628
Of course, boss,

99
00:06:17,653 --> 00:06:20,364
I even used all the salary
I earned recently to chip in.

100
00:06:20,389 --> 00:06:21,406
Good.

101
00:06:21,681 --> 00:06:24,594
Good on you! I hope
it helped somehow.

102
00:06:24,927 --> 00:06:26,281
It sure did, boss!

103
00:06:26,509 --> 00:06:29,449
Alright, make sure
everything's done by 4 PM.

104
00:06:29,505 --> 00:06:31,242
- Will do, boss, no problem.
- Everything should be loaded.

105
00:06:31,267 --> 00:06:32,531
- Yes, boss.
- Alright then.

106
00:06:32,556 --> 00:06:33,474
Sure thing, boss.

107
00:06:58,211 --> 00:06:59,370
What are you up to?

108
00:07:00,132 --> 00:07:06,485
I'm just wondering how many years
it'll take to pay back the land loan.

109
00:07:07,734 --> 00:07:09,299
Don't sweat it.

110
00:07:09,795 --> 00:07:12,578
What matters is
we found a way, right?

111
00:07:16,062 --> 00:07:17,120
Thank you.

112
00:07:17,804 --> 00:07:21,711
Your money helped big time.

113
00:07:41,353 --> 00:07:42,462
Not now.

114
00:07:42,619 --> 00:07:44,659
Mom's awake downstairs.

115
00:07:45,018 --> 00:07:46,737
So what? We're married.

116
00:10:55,062 --> 00:10:56,852
- Ma?
- Yes?

117
00:10:57,422 --> 00:10:58,724
Is there a problem?

118
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,252
It's been three days, dear...

119
00:11:02,277 --> 00:11:04,321
I haven't received any call.

120
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:08,718
Relax, Ma!

121
00:11:08,857 --> 00:11:12,493
Didn't Uncle promise
he'd handle it? Plus...

122
00:11:12,939 --> 00:11:15,346
he mentioned no one's
interested in the land.

123
00:11:16,667 --> 00:11:17,876
- You're right!
- Mama Rita!

124
00:11:18,085 --> 00:11:18,794
Yes?

125
00:11:18,872 --> 00:11:20,109
Ana's right.

126
00:11:20,644 --> 00:11:25,243
Just relax. Soon enough,
you'll get a call.

127
00:11:27,302 --> 00:11:28,737
- Just relax...
- There you go.

128
00:11:28,762 --> 00:11:31,682
- Eat up and drink your medicine.
- Sure thing, dear.

129
00:11:31,707 --> 00:11:32,883
I'm okay now.

130
00:11:52,319 --> 00:11:54,086
That's Arturo, isn't it?

131
00:11:55,024 --> 00:11:57,171
What's that asshole doing here?

132
00:11:58,914 --> 00:12:00,583
This is what I was telling you, Mike.

133
00:12:01,632 --> 00:12:05,017
Look, all that should
be Madre de Cacao.

134
00:12:05,042 --> 00:12:06,002
Look how dense it is.

135
00:12:06,727 --> 00:12:07,824
You take care of it.

136
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:08,819
Hello!

137
00:12:08,844 --> 00:12:10,554
- The ones with deep...
- Hello, Rita.

138
00:12:10,579 --> 00:12:12,247
- Bro, what happened?
- I'm really sorry.

139
00:12:12,344 --> 00:12:13,765
Arturo placed a bid.

140
00:12:14,741 --> 00:12:16,727
- What?
- He got the property.

141
00:12:16,904 --> 00:12:19,914
- Arturo won the bid?
- And I didn't think that

142
00:12:19,972 --> 00:12:21,321
that he'll be the one to win.

143
00:12:22,499 --> 00:12:24,293
- I see, thank you.
- I'm really sorry, Rita.

144
00:12:24,318 --> 00:12:26,024
Thanks, no problem.

145
00:12:29,325 --> 00:12:30,602
Hey, Arturo!

146
00:12:30,627 --> 00:12:32,740
What are you doing here?
Damn you.

147
00:12:32,765 --> 00:12:35,047
The bank told me...

148
00:12:35,953 --> 00:12:37,924
I won the bid.

149
00:12:38,438 --> 00:12:40,404
So, this property's mine now.

150
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:42,204
But Uncle, why did you do that?

151
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:46,070
You know my mother
inherited this land!

152
00:12:46,212 --> 00:12:47,710
You know, little girl,

153
00:12:48,253 --> 00:12:50,219
the bank's got its rules.

154
00:12:51,099 --> 00:12:53,485
Anyone can bid.

155
00:12:54,827 --> 00:12:55,895
Right?

156
00:12:56,683 --> 00:12:58,797
So, I'm not breaking any rules.

157
00:12:59,394 --> 00:13:04,180
And I'm not doing anything wrong.

158
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:08,141
Uncle, you shouldn't have join the bid!

159
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:11,211
We could've saved our home!

160
00:13:11,657 --> 00:13:14,594
Why don't you
talk to the bank?

161
00:13:15,505 --> 00:13:16,561
Don't complain to me.

162
00:13:16,971 --> 00:13:18,055
I'm out of it.

163
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:22,446
You always wanted this land,
didn't you?

164
00:13:23,807 --> 00:13:25,305
- Enough, dear.
- No, Ma!

165
00:13:25,773 --> 00:13:28,143
He's playing dirty!

166
00:13:28,686 --> 00:13:31,710
I knew you always wanted us out!

167
00:13:32,797 --> 00:13:33,820
Traitor!

168
00:13:33,845 --> 00:13:38,850
Enough of this!
Stop bothering me!

169
00:13:40,344 --> 00:13:42,500
If anyone's to blame,

170
00:13:43,305 --> 00:13:45,815
it's your husband.

171
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:50,118
- who sold and mortgaged this land.
- Don't bring the dead into this!

172
00:13:50,602 --> 00:13:53,712
If this was passed down to me...

173
00:13:54,393 --> 00:13:57,226
and was given to
me by Mama Luz...

174
00:13:57,470 --> 00:14:02,680
I'd have put up
a business by now.

175
00:14:02,892 --> 00:14:04,227
I told you, Mom,

176
00:14:04,793 --> 00:14:06,711
- he's always been greedy!
- Ana, Ana!

177
00:14:06,736 --> 00:14:08,383
- Enough, dear!
- Enough!

178
00:14:09,451 --> 00:14:10,994
Enough! Calm down.

179
00:14:12,835 --> 00:14:14,118
Arturo.

180
00:14:15,773 --> 00:14:16,859
Brother,

181
00:14:19,963 --> 00:14:21,521
can't we...

182
00:14:22,891 --> 00:14:24,793
please sort this out?

183
00:14:25,884 --> 00:14:28,539
We're family, right?

184
00:14:30,391 --> 00:14:31,431
Maybe...

185
00:14:32,649 --> 00:14:33,691
Sure!

186
00:14:34,393 --> 00:14:36,211
I'm fairly reasonable.

187
00:14:37,019 --> 00:14:40,953
I have no problem
if you want the property back.

188
00:14:42,078 --> 00:14:43,157
Okay...

189
00:14:44,266 --> 00:14:45,779
I want half a million.

190
00:14:48,612 --> 00:14:50,602
I'll waive the interest.

191
00:14:52,158 --> 00:14:53,856
Simple as that, right?

192
00:15:08,719 --> 00:15:11,345
Your cousin's such a jerk, Ma!

193
00:15:12,454 --> 00:15:13,533
Traitor!

194
00:15:15,165 --> 00:15:17,015
What's done is done, dear.

195
00:15:18,658 --> 00:15:20,289
But he's not wrong.

196
00:15:20,631 --> 00:15:23,805
He didn't break any laws.

197
00:15:24,336 --> 00:15:25,568
But still!

198
00:15:25,922 --> 00:15:27,792
He's shameless!

199
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:32,101
God will guide us, dear.

200
00:15:32,241 --> 00:15:36,258
I'll pay back what I borrowed
from Linda and that lender.

201
00:15:36,597 --> 00:15:39,984
I'll just plead with them
not to add any interest.

202
00:15:50,383 --> 00:15:52,025
We'll get through this.

203
00:15:54,632 --> 00:15:56,125
God is merciful!

204
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:03,792
Alright.

205
00:16:13,213 --> 00:16:14,884
Please sort this out there.

206
00:16:20,626 --> 00:16:21,844
- Ma?
- Yes?

207
00:16:22,157 --> 00:16:23,742
- You alright?
- I'm fine.

208
00:16:24,127 --> 00:16:25,189
I'm fine now.

209
00:16:34,694 --> 00:16:36,071
Ma, let's go.

210
00:16:57,257 --> 00:16:59,718
Arturo really is something, right?

211
00:16:59,743 --> 00:17:00,944
Yeah!

212
00:17:00,969 --> 00:17:02,237
I thought he was nice!

213
00:17:02,262 --> 00:17:05,564
- Turns out he's sly too!
- What? How so?

214
00:17:05,589 --> 00:17:07,353
But you know his wife...

215
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:11,396
My God, the way she goes
to church and prays!

216
00:17:12,731 --> 00:17:14,306
I've been drinking since earlier.

217
00:17:16,899 --> 00:17:18,723
Choleng, thank you so much!

218
00:17:19,564 --> 00:17:22,299
Thank you.
I'd go somewhere else,

219
00:17:22,324 --> 00:17:25,009
- but you're all I've got.
- Oh, enough already!

220
00:17:25,327 --> 00:17:26,786
What's with all this drama?

221
00:17:27,056 --> 00:17:29,431
You're always welcome here!
Don't act like you're a stranger!

222
00:17:29,456 --> 00:17:31,291
You're so annoying!

223
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:33,810
If I ever see that Arturo...

224
00:17:33,835 --> 00:17:35,174
- What?
- I'll punch him.

225
00:17:40,986 --> 00:17:42,697
Do you want the rest?

226
00:17:44,304 --> 00:17:45,400
You can have it.

227
00:17:46,598 --> 00:17:47,658
Are you sure?

228
00:17:49,353 --> 00:17:51,061
You know I don't drink.

229
00:17:52,731 --> 00:17:53,829
Okay.

230
00:18:01,386 --> 00:18:02,669
What's on your mind?

231
00:18:03,739 --> 00:18:06,825
I want to get our house
and land back from Arturo.

232
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:10,135
I'll do whatever it takes.

233
00:18:12,063 --> 00:18:13,147
What's your plan?

234
00:18:15,251 --> 00:18:17,003
I want to leave my job,

235
00:18:17,352 --> 00:18:18,838
the pay is too small.

236
00:18:19,368 --> 00:18:21,858
My hair would turn
to white working

237
00:18:21,883 --> 00:18:24,188
before we'll get our property back.

238
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:27,681
So, do you have a plan?

239
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:31,953
I want us to move out.

240
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,187
Like, on our own?

241
00:18:34,938 --> 00:18:36,064
Why not?

242
00:18:36,736 --> 00:18:38,622
We're married after all.

243
00:18:41,852 --> 00:18:43,386
How about Pampanga?

244
00:18:44,399 --> 00:18:46,246
All the tourists are there.

245
00:18:46,952 --> 00:18:48,860
Businesses are everywhere too.

246
00:18:49,843 --> 00:18:53,133
But do you know anyone there?

247
00:18:58,079 --> 00:18:59,309
Mando.

248
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:02,382
We can trust him.

249
00:19:03,942 --> 00:19:06,653
He can find us a place to stay,
somewhere to work.

250
00:19:06,678 --> 00:19:07,821
He'll help us.

251
00:19:11,453 --> 00:19:14,047
I'd go anywhere with you.

252
00:20:08,705 --> 00:20:11,016
Thank you so much, man!

253
00:20:11,126 --> 00:20:14,602
Come on!
We gotta help each other out, right?

254
00:20:15,798 --> 00:20:17,390
Have you been here long?

255
00:20:17,415 --> 00:20:20,432
Yeah, maybe five years.

256
00:20:20,751 --> 00:20:22,045
Here we are.

257
00:20:22,433 --> 00:20:24,560
Welcome to Hotel California.

258
00:20:25,118 --> 00:20:26,132
Caloy!

259
00:20:26,414 --> 00:20:27,438
Caloy!

260
00:20:28,132 --> 00:20:29,634
- How's it going?
- Good, Mando!

261
00:20:29,736 --> 00:20:32,572
These are my friends,
Ben and Ana.

262
00:20:32,597 --> 00:20:33,985
They're from La Union.

263
00:20:35,766 --> 00:20:39,813
That's Caloy, he works for the boss
who runs that gambling spot.

264
00:20:40,281 --> 00:20:41,594
Come on, come on.

265
00:20:42,415 --> 00:20:45,902
It's a bit noisy here,
but you'll get used to it.

266
00:20:46,486 --> 00:20:47,904
Right? It's got everything.

267
00:20:48,154 --> 00:20:49,489
Barber shops,

268
00:20:49,514 --> 00:20:51,562
laundry services if you need them.

269
00:20:51,587 --> 00:20:55,132
Everything! Convenience stores,
bars, hangout spots.

270
00:20:55,157 --> 00:20:56,843
You won't need anything else.

271
00:20:57,330 --> 00:20:58,453
- Cool!
- Okay?

272
00:20:58,478 --> 00:21:00,820
Let me show you the second floor.

273
00:21:01,552 --> 00:21:03,405
It was originally a hotel.

274
00:21:03,592 --> 00:21:06,553
But the contractor didn't continue,

275
00:21:06,578 --> 00:21:08,835
so now we benefit from it.

276
00:21:08,968 --> 00:21:12,387
Right? Just think
you're living in America.

277
00:21:12,412 --> 00:21:15,874
That's why it's called Hotel California!

278
00:21:16,667 --> 00:21:18,757
Welcome to my penthouse.

279
00:21:18,974 --> 00:21:20,826
Hold on, let me open this.

280
00:21:29,589 --> 00:21:31,054
Okay, come in!

281
00:21:32,179 --> 00:21:33,519
I've got to run.

282
00:21:33,544 --> 00:21:34,718
I'll leave you guys here for now.

283
00:21:35,529 --> 00:21:36,662
Alright, see you upstairs.

284
00:21:49,267 --> 00:21:50,957
This is how it is here, huh?

285
00:21:55,108 --> 00:21:56,311
In the city?

286
00:21:58,187 --> 00:21:59,210
Yeah,

287
00:21:59,882 --> 00:22:02,822
so many new things,
and many old ones too.

288
00:22:04,439 --> 00:22:10,236
Lots of fresh stuff,
but plenty is rotten as well.

289
00:22:18,735 --> 00:22:20,872
Love, Mando will help us.

290
00:22:24,271 --> 00:22:30,875
And when it comes to the two of us,
I have your back.

291
00:22:52,694 --> 00:22:53,999
Here's your coffee.

292
00:23:00,828 --> 00:23:02,288
Eat up!

293
00:23:02,288 --> 00:23:03,081
Eat up!

294
00:23:04,108 --> 00:23:05,634
That looks delicious.

295
00:23:08,422 --> 00:23:09,423
More coffee here.

296
00:23:09,448 --> 00:23:10,476
This tastes good!

297
00:23:11,295 --> 00:23:13,024
Well, we wake up early.

298
00:23:13,049 --> 00:23:14,812
You know how it is in the province.

299
00:23:15,507 --> 00:23:16,570
I know.

300
00:23:16,857 --> 00:23:17,889
Fair point.

301
00:23:18,499 --> 00:23:19,607
Where's Ben?

302
00:23:20,296 --> 00:23:23,101
Oh, don't wait for him.
He takes ages to shower.

303
00:23:24,143 --> 00:23:25,853
Oh, Ana,

304
00:23:26,562 --> 00:23:28,314
I'll handle looking for your job.

305
00:23:28,827 --> 00:23:30,662
Didn't I say I'd find one for you?

306
00:23:31,442 --> 00:23:33,611
If ever, can you work nights?

307
00:23:34,195 --> 00:23:36,382
Sure, no problem.

308
00:23:36,407 --> 00:23:38,695
You good? Alright, great.

309
00:23:39,329 --> 00:23:40,385
Let's eat.

310
00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:41,515
Here's your coffee.

311
00:23:51,004 --> 00:23:52,505
Oh, sorry, sorry.

312
00:23:53,715 --> 00:23:55,717
I'm really sorry.
It was open.

313
00:24:14,483 --> 00:24:15,420
Ben, let's eat.

314
00:24:15,445 --> 00:24:17,117
I thought you were going
to take a bath?

315
00:24:17,934 --> 00:24:20,162
The line was so long.

316
00:24:21,078 --> 00:24:24,370
It's first come, first serve here,
only one bathroom after all.

317
00:24:24,787 --> 00:24:28,875
Hey, remember Caloy from yesterday?

318
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:30,441
Caloy, the one from downstairs?

319
00:24:31,228 --> 00:24:32,994
- Ah, yes, Caloy.
- Remember?

320
00:24:33,166 --> 00:24:35,198
He'll accompany you later, okay?

321
00:24:36,816 --> 00:24:37,859
He'll go with me?

322
00:24:37,884 --> 00:24:39,830
Yes, I have other errands.

323
00:24:39,969 --> 00:24:41,549
What time are we going
to the restaurant?

324
00:24:41,605 --> 00:24:43,619
Well, whenever you want.

325
00:24:43,671 --> 00:24:45,189
Maybe after eating?

326
00:24:47,697 --> 00:24:49,997
Bro, is the owner strict?

327
00:24:51,481 --> 00:24:52,899
No worries,
Sir Gener's kind.

328
00:24:53,399 --> 00:24:54,776
Don't embarrass me there!

329
00:24:55,401 --> 00:24:58,404
I recommended you to be a waiter.

330
00:24:58,404 --> 00:25:01,240
I'll do my best,
as long as the pay is good.

331
00:25:01,365 --> 00:25:04,535
Don't worry,
he's not stingy! He's loaded!

332
00:25:05,453 --> 00:25:07,455
Do you work there?

333
00:25:08,135 --> 00:25:09,165
No.

334
00:25:09,832 --> 00:25:11,459
So, where do you work?

335
00:25:11,553 --> 00:25:12,763
Anywhere, really.

336
00:25:13,169 --> 00:25:16,214
As long as a job presents itself,
I'm game.

337
00:25:16,672 --> 00:25:21,010
The important thing is,
you both work hard here.

338
00:25:21,777 --> 00:25:23,237
To get ahead in life.

339
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:24,603
Right?

340
00:25:24,931 --> 00:25:25,473
Okay?

341
00:25:25,681 --> 00:25:26,849
Let's eat. This is good.

342
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:31,356
Tastes good!

343
00:25:33,238 --> 00:25:34,314
Ben, right?

344
00:25:34,581 --> 00:25:35,587
Yes, sir.

345
00:25:35,666 --> 00:25:37,330
Yes, sir, Do you have
restaurant experience?

346
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:39,378
To be honest, sir, I don't.

347
00:25:39,403 --> 00:25:42,205
Alright, don't worry,
we'll train you.

348
00:25:42,448 --> 00:25:43,783
You can start today.

349
00:25:43,808 --> 00:25:44,308
Boss?

350
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:46,385
- Thank you so much, boss!
- Great!

351
00:25:46,410 --> 00:25:51,624
Always be courteous
and smile at the customers, okay?

352
00:25:52,009 --> 00:25:54,579
The manager will fill you
in on the rest.

353
00:25:54,604 --> 00:25:55,698
Alright, sir.

354
00:25:56,408 --> 00:25:57,486
Catalina!

355
00:26:08,850 --> 00:26:11,322
Hello, Ma!
How are you?

356
00:26:16,858 --> 00:26:18,317
How's my daughter?

357
00:26:18,918 --> 00:26:20,378
I'm doing good, Ma!

358
00:26:20,403 --> 00:26:21,863
Have you found a job already?

359
00:26:21,888 --> 00:26:25,885
Right now,
I haven't found a job yet.

360
00:26:26,192 --> 00:26:28,778
But Ben already found one.

361
00:26:28,911 --> 00:26:32,736
That's just how it is.
You just gotta keep your hopes up.

362
00:26:33,321 --> 00:26:37,453
Ma, I'll call you as soon
as I get a job, okay?

363
00:26:38,296 --> 00:26:39,172
You'll surely find one.

364
00:26:39,172 --> 00:26:40,590
You take good care of her, okay?

365
00:26:40,615 --> 00:26:42,213
- Of course!
- Alright.

366
00:26:42,238 --> 00:26:43,214
It works both ways.

367
00:26:43,259 --> 00:26:43,885
Alright.

368
00:26:43,885 --> 00:26:46,095
- You two have fun and—
- You take care.

369
00:26:46,095 --> 00:26:46,846
Alright, Ma!

370
00:26:46,846 --> 00:26:48,848
I know what you two
are gonna do tonight.

371
00:26:49,869 --> 00:26:50,889
Why wait?

372
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:53,411
Thank you!

373
00:26:53,436 --> 00:26:54,645
Thank you, ma'am, sir!

374
00:26:54,670 --> 00:26:56,672
- We hope you come back!
- I told you he's your type.

375
00:26:57,070 --> 00:26:58,238
Cut it out!

376
00:27:02,236 --> 00:27:03,237
Thank you ma'am!

377
00:27:04,869 --> 00:27:06,519
- Thank you.
- Ben, clean that up.

378
00:27:07,238 --> 00:27:09,260
- Ma'am, thanks!
- Thank you, really.

379
00:27:09,285 --> 00:27:10,252
See you again soon!

380
00:27:13,764 --> 00:27:15,808
Take care of the plates first
then just come back for the rest.

381
00:27:15,833 --> 00:27:17,376
- Alright.
- Miss, order!

382
00:27:17,401 --> 00:27:18,353
Yes, ma'am!

383
00:27:27,103 --> 00:27:30,656
Really, love? You're allowed
to bring home food from work?

384
00:27:30,681 --> 00:27:31,474
Yes.

385
00:27:31,499 --> 00:27:33,084
These aren't leftovers,
are they?

386
00:27:33,109 --> 00:27:34,752
Of course not!

387
00:27:35,015 --> 00:27:36,784
These are just excess from
all the meals they cooked.

388
00:27:36,809 --> 00:27:39,313
They're really kind,

389
00:27:39,565 --> 00:27:41,234
they gave all of these. See!

390
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:44,463
Wow, you're really lucky!

391
00:27:44,737 --> 00:27:45,863
I know, right?

392
00:27:46,113 --> 00:27:47,323
I think...

393
00:27:49,650 --> 00:27:52,391
adding up what I earn in a week,
plus all the tips,

394
00:27:52,885 --> 00:27:54,424
it would total to...

395
00:27:58,438 --> 00:28:01,130
just one-month salary
back at the rice factory.

396
00:28:01,736 --> 00:28:02,877
Even more!

397
00:28:03,548 --> 00:28:04,695
More.

398
00:28:04,879 --> 00:28:06,782
I hope this continues.

399
00:28:07,947 --> 00:28:09,128
Me, too.

400
00:28:14,725 --> 00:28:16,894
By the way,
did you hear from Mando?

401
00:28:17,812 --> 00:28:18,562
Any news?

402
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:20,356
No I haven't talked to him yet.

403
00:28:20,773 --> 00:28:22,942
I'm just waiting for his message.

404
00:28:22,967 --> 00:28:24,645
Don't worry, Ana...

405
00:28:25,362 --> 00:28:27,030
Soon enough,
I know you'll find a job.

406
00:28:27,055 --> 00:28:29,558
I'm sure of it,
you're the smartest person I know!

407
00:28:33,221 --> 00:28:34,463
Go on, eat.

408
00:28:35,815 --> 00:28:36,942
Thank you.

409
00:28:40,088 --> 00:28:41,522
Miss, beer please.

410
00:28:43,322 --> 00:28:44,450
Remove the cap.

411
00:28:49,845 --> 00:28:51,925
Oh and a cigarette, red.

412
00:29:00,692 --> 00:29:03,237
You're Mando's visitor, right?

413
00:29:04,463 --> 00:29:05,257
Yes.

414
00:29:05,444 --> 00:29:06,362
Where are you guys from?

415
00:29:07,861 --> 00:29:08,750
From La Union.

416
00:29:08,821 --> 00:29:10,072
Ah, okay.

417
00:29:13,424 --> 00:29:14,758
Aren't you the...

418
00:29:17,471 --> 00:29:18,806
Oh, yes.

419
00:29:18,831 --> 00:29:19,745
I'm really sorry.

420
00:29:19,770 --> 00:29:21,370
- No, it's okay.
- I'm sorry, I really am.

421
00:29:21,646 --> 00:29:25,858
I covered up immediately,
you didn't see anything, right?

422
00:29:31,529 --> 00:29:33,315
I'm Nancy, by the way.

423
00:29:35,632 --> 00:29:36,425
Ben.

424
00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:39,661
But miss, next time make sure
the door's locked, okay?

425
00:29:39,685 --> 00:29:41,432
You'll never know...

426
00:29:41,457 --> 00:29:43,116
What can they do to me?

427
00:29:43,647 --> 00:29:44,940
Rape me?

428
00:29:45,205 --> 00:29:46,658
Abuse me?

429
00:29:47,251 --> 00:29:49,650
They won't even try.

430
00:29:50,013 --> 00:29:51,275
You see this?

431
00:29:52,955 --> 00:29:54,128
Ana, right?

432
00:29:54,465 --> 00:29:57,267
Yes, sir.
Ana Fuentes.

433
00:29:58,447 --> 00:29:59,639
How old are you?

434
00:29:59,664 --> 00:30:01,002
I'm 25.

435
00:30:01,047 --> 00:30:03,432
You look young for your age.

436
00:30:04,142 --> 00:30:05,721
What's your previous job?

437
00:30:05,784 --> 00:30:08,502
At a resort, sir,
I did housekeeping.

438
00:30:08,798 --> 00:30:10,963
Honestly, Mando,

439
00:30:11,377 --> 00:30:13,541
I already said yes to another applicant.

440
00:30:13,566 --> 00:30:15,626
You guys are quite late.

441
00:30:17,377 --> 00:30:18,547
Really?

442
00:30:18,890 --> 00:30:22,494
That's okay,
I'll just tell Sir Francis

443
00:30:22,859 --> 00:30:24,319
the job's already taken.

444
00:30:24,344 --> 00:30:26,620
No, let me,
he's a regular in here.

445
00:30:26,832 --> 00:30:28,125
Alright, thanks!

446
00:30:28,150 --> 00:30:29,299
I'm sorry, okay?

447
00:30:29,344 --> 00:30:30,877
- Bye, sir.
- Goodbye.

448
00:30:31,544 --> 00:30:32,924
Okay, thanks!

449
00:30:33,084 --> 00:30:34,651
- I'm really sorry.
- Thank you.

450
00:30:37,115 --> 00:30:39,689
Hey, Sarge!

451
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:40,706
Mando!

452
00:30:41,539 --> 00:30:43,207
How are you?
Long time, huh.

453
00:30:43,582 --> 00:30:44,417
Long time!

454
00:30:45,306 --> 00:30:46,548
Is she your wife?

455
00:30:49,878 --> 00:30:51,142
Well...

456
00:30:52,041 --> 00:30:53,076
Yeah?

457
00:30:54,307 --> 00:30:57,488
Is she new? Maybe you could...

458
00:30:57,513 --> 00:30:58,531
What?

459
00:30:58,556 --> 00:30:59,598
No, Sarge.

460
00:31:00,349 --> 00:31:01,906
That's my friend's girlfriend.

461
00:31:02,468 --> 00:31:03,950
She's looking for a job.

462
00:31:04,895 --> 00:31:06,480
What happened, did she find one?

463
00:31:07,648 --> 00:31:09,233
There's no vacancy,
apparently.

464
00:31:13,072 --> 00:31:14,581
Can you introduce me?

465
00:31:19,269 --> 00:31:20,436
Come on!

466
00:31:21,996 --> 00:31:22,830
Okay, Sarge.

467
00:31:22,855 --> 00:31:23,898
Let's go.

468
00:31:27,268 --> 00:31:30,104
Ana, this is Sarge.
Sarge, this is Ana.

469
00:31:30,129 --> 00:31:32,156
- He wants to get to know you.
- Sarge, I'm Ana.

470
00:31:34,182 --> 00:31:38,697
With a face like yours,
I'm a fool not to introduce myself.

471
00:31:38,856 --> 00:31:40,274
Oh, really.

472
00:31:43,742 --> 00:31:45,244
Sarge, we'll go ahead.

473
00:31:45,269 --> 00:31:46,451
Can I...

474
00:31:47,997 --> 00:31:49,707
Can I get your number?

475
00:31:49,732 --> 00:31:51,275
Oh, Sarge,

476
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:53,815
what would I use then,
if you take my number?

477
00:32:09,799 --> 00:32:11,548
Ana Fuentes, sir.

478
00:32:12,822 --> 00:32:14,643
Ana Fuentes.

479
00:32:21,416 --> 00:32:22,519
Alright, Sarge.

480
00:32:25,376 --> 00:32:28,346
Mando, who is that?

481
00:32:28,604 --> 00:32:30,105
That's Sarge Teodoro.

482
00:32:30,748 --> 00:32:32,625
He's one of the protectors
here in Angeles,

483
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:33,317
especially for bars.

484
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:36,084
He's cool.

485
00:32:36,779 --> 00:32:37,710
Is he a police officer?

486
00:32:38,113 --> 00:32:39,420
He used to.

487
00:32:53,807 --> 00:32:54,875
Hello?

488
00:32:55,021 --> 00:32:56,790
- Hello.
- Hello Sarge?

489
00:32:56,815 --> 00:32:57,586
Ana.

490
00:32:58,133 --> 00:32:59,557
I got you a job.

491
00:33:00,219 --> 00:33:00,970
Really?

492
00:33:01,278 --> 00:33:02,296
Yeah!

493
00:33:02,321 --> 00:33:04,323
Sarge, thank you very much!

494
00:33:04,348 --> 00:33:05,766
Don't mention it.

495
00:33:05,791 --> 00:33:07,454
This is a solid investment.

496
00:33:08,069 --> 00:33:09,245
A guaranteed win!

497
00:33:09,270 --> 00:33:11,605
So many tourists and foreigners,

498
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:13,391
we're going to make money here.

499
00:33:14,542 --> 00:33:16,835
It's a sure thing!
No, no, no.

500
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:18,362
We're not gambling here.

501
00:33:18,387 --> 00:33:19,805
- This is going to work.
- Sarge!

502
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:20,906
Yes.

503
00:33:20,931 --> 00:33:23,826
Mr. Tan, Mr. Tan,
excuse me for a moment.

504
00:33:24,068 --> 00:33:25,987
I just need to sign a document.

505
00:33:26,470 --> 00:33:30,015
Alright, I'll call you back.
Thank you, Sir! Okay.

506
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:32,459
Sarge, you're here.

507
00:33:32,484 --> 00:33:33,672
Of course.

508
00:33:33,697 --> 00:33:36,836
Would I miss your first day at work?

509
00:33:37,423 --> 00:33:38,937
Thank you so much!

510
00:33:39,977 --> 00:33:41,016
You're welcome.

511
00:33:41,041 --> 00:33:43,868
What's important is
that you have a job.

512
00:33:47,891 --> 00:33:50,118
I'll head in now.

513
00:33:53,689 --> 00:33:54,398
Excuse me!

514
00:34:03,907 --> 00:34:06,118
Sir, there are still
spots available upstairs.

515
00:34:06,143 --> 00:34:07,719
You can go now.

516
00:34:10,874 --> 00:34:12,099
How's the sales?

517
00:34:12,124 --> 00:34:13,709
It's doing fine, sir.

518
00:34:13,734 --> 00:34:16,111
Here's our yesterday's sale.

519
00:34:16,136 --> 00:34:17,111
Sir!

520
00:34:17,136 --> 00:34:18,289
- Oh, Ana.
- Good evening.

521
00:34:19,024 --> 00:34:20,460
How was your first night?

522
00:34:21,007 --> 00:34:22,651
We have a lot of customers.

523
00:34:22,676 --> 00:34:25,204
- We need to be alert, okay?
- Yes, sir.

524
00:34:25,946 --> 00:34:27,056
Miss, Miss!

525
00:34:27,081 --> 00:34:28,032
Miss.

526
00:34:28,057 --> 00:34:29,308
Okay, we'll...

527
00:34:29,333 --> 00:34:32,532
Can I order a sisig
and sizzling mushroom?

528
00:34:32,889 --> 00:34:34,975
- Is that all, sir?
- Yes.

529
00:35:00,138 --> 00:35:01,807
Love, let's eat!

530
00:35:02,244 --> 00:35:04,688
Wow, this is fancy.

531
00:35:05,106 --> 00:35:07,672
And the food here looks delicious.

532
00:35:07,697 --> 00:35:08,688
Yeah.

533
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:11,797
Did you hit the jackpot or something?

534
00:35:11,929 --> 00:35:12,910
Nope.

535
00:35:12,935 --> 00:35:15,729
You wouldn't bring me here
if you lost, right?

536
00:35:17,665 --> 00:35:18,415
Just a little bit.

537
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:19,441
But remember,

538
00:35:19,466 --> 00:35:21,086
we're saving up money for something.

539
00:35:22,878 --> 00:35:23,921
Of course,

540
00:35:23,946 --> 00:35:26,016
I always keep our
priorities in mind.

541
00:35:26,824 --> 00:35:30,869
Let's just consider this a celebration
for what we've done so far.

542
00:35:31,449 --> 00:35:32,705
As we should!

543
00:35:35,332 --> 00:35:36,208
Dig in.

544
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:48,946
Be good for grandma, okay?

545
00:35:48,971 --> 00:35:52,089
Of course, she'll be...

546
00:37:44,548 --> 00:37:45,750
Ben!

547
00:37:46,479 --> 00:37:47,553
Hey!

548
00:37:48,561 --> 00:37:49,978
We've got a full house!

549
00:37:53,896 --> 00:37:55,030
Hey, Sarge,

550
00:37:55,055 --> 00:37:55,973
didn't expect to see you here.

551
00:37:55,998 --> 00:37:58,182
Ana! Just passing through.

552
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,541
Miss, another beer, please.

553
00:38:00,850 --> 00:38:02,018
Sorry, Sir,

554
00:38:02,043 --> 00:38:03,121
it's a bit busy.

555
00:38:03,146 --> 00:38:04,588
No worries, no worries.

556
00:38:13,310 --> 00:38:14,661
How's it going for you here?

557
00:38:14,686 --> 00:38:19,127
It's all good,
always hustling every night.

558
00:38:19,329 --> 00:38:21,748
That's the game.
But hey, when I...

559
00:38:22,416 --> 00:38:24,338
eventually open my bar,

560
00:38:24,972 --> 00:38:26,838
you're gonna be my manager.

561
00:38:26,863 --> 00:38:28,580
Manager? Just like that?

562
00:38:28,630 --> 00:38:31,984
I might need to
learn how to be one.

563
00:38:32,009 --> 00:38:35,229
You won't have to,
I got you covered.

564
00:38:36,111 --> 00:38:37,550
Sir, another beer?

565
00:38:49,086 --> 00:38:50,152
For you.

566
00:38:50,177 --> 00:38:53,211
A tip sir, you haven't billed out yet.

567
00:38:53,642 --> 00:38:54,719
It's fine, take it.

568
00:38:58,289 --> 00:39:00,124
Miss, I'd like to order!

569
00:39:02,915 --> 00:39:04,454
- Thanks, Sarge!
- Keep at it.

570
00:39:09,755 --> 00:39:11,131
Miss, can I get some water?

571
00:39:16,514 --> 00:39:17,648
Sir.

572
00:39:17,868 --> 00:39:18,619
Thanks.

573
00:39:35,297 --> 00:39:37,507
Oh, Sarge,
you're still here?

574
00:39:37,532 --> 00:39:39,555
Ana, I was waiting for you.

575
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:41,498
Come, I'll drive you home.

576
00:39:41,523 --> 00:39:43,288
Oh, no Sarge,
I'm good, really.

577
00:39:43,288 --> 00:39:45,791
No, there's a lot of creeps in here.

578
00:39:45,791 --> 00:39:47,000
- At least I can protect you.
- Ana.

579
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:47,751
Ben!

580
00:39:47,751 --> 00:39:49,127
Meet Sarge,

581
00:39:49,152 --> 00:39:50,988
a friend of Sir Arman's.

582
00:39:51,491 --> 00:39:53,454
He's a regular here.

583
00:39:54,329 --> 00:39:55,347
Ben.

584
00:39:55,384 --> 00:39:57,052
Good timing, Ben.

585
00:39:57,886 --> 00:40:00,243
I was just planning
to bring Ana home.

586
00:40:00,268 --> 00:40:03,188
Alright then, Ben.

587
00:40:03,213 --> 00:40:04,336
Stay safe!

588
00:40:26,505 --> 00:40:27,570
Ben!

589
00:40:32,351 --> 00:40:33,393
Ben!

590
00:40:34,785 --> 00:40:36,734
It's morning and
you're still drinking?

591
00:40:37,175 --> 00:40:38,351
Who's this Sarge?

592
00:40:39,358 --> 00:40:40,703
- Sarge?
- Yeah, Sarge!

593
00:40:40,947 --> 00:40:44,610
Sarge, he's our regular at the KTV,

594
00:40:44,945 --> 00:40:46,463
friend of Sir Arman.

595
00:40:46,539 --> 00:40:47,898
He's a good guy.

596
00:40:48,522 --> 00:40:49,625
What do you mean, "good"?

597
00:40:51,606 --> 00:40:53,108
And what do you mean by "friend"?

598
00:40:54,346 --> 00:40:56,469
Men always play the nice card.
No one's that nice.

599
00:40:56,987 --> 00:40:58,488
- Oh, come on!
- What?

600
00:40:59,573 --> 00:41:02,034
He seems really into you!

601
00:41:02,096 --> 00:41:04,828
Ben, what's gotten into you?

602
00:41:05,201 --> 00:41:06,493
You're drunk.

603
00:41:08,306 --> 00:41:10,141
Let's go to bed.

604
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:13,020
You're just jealous,
aren't you?

605
00:41:13,045 --> 00:41:14,227
I'm not jealous!

606
00:41:14,379 --> 00:41:15,714
- Sure sounds like it.
- Damn it...

607
00:41:16,352 --> 00:41:18,537
You know I hate it when you do that.

608
00:41:18,646 --> 00:41:20,054
You're jealous.

609
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:23,513
- Come on, let's go to sleep.
- I'm not jealous.

610
00:41:26,058 --> 00:41:27,184
Mando's not here yet.

611
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:29,321
Let's go.

612
00:41:29,891 --> 00:41:30,771
Come on.

613
00:41:30,796 --> 00:41:31,588
Okay, okay!

614
00:41:34,484 --> 00:41:35,652
Just let me finish this.

615
00:41:37,431 --> 00:41:38,788
Hurry up.

616
00:41:53,281 --> 00:41:54,322
Hey, bro!

617
00:41:54,588 --> 00:41:56,242
- Where's Ana?
- Upstairs.

618
00:41:56,556 --> 00:41:58,141
- Can you tell her I'm here?
- Alright, alright.

619
00:42:00,849 --> 00:42:01,875
Ana!

620
00:42:29,989 --> 00:42:31,054
Who's that?

621
00:42:32,541 --> 00:42:33,500
It's Nancy,

622
00:42:33,525 --> 00:42:34,810
she sent a message.

623
00:42:34,835 --> 00:42:37,462
She's asking if we can drop
by the store, it's her birthday.

624
00:42:37,963 --> 00:42:39,214
She's also inviting you.

625
00:42:39,443 --> 00:42:40,508
A birthday?

626
00:42:40,533 --> 00:42:44,620
Why's she sending pictures like
she's fishing for compliments?

627
00:42:44,645 --> 00:42:45,971
Don't jump to conclusions.

628
00:42:45,996 --> 00:42:47,907
You know how kids these days are, right?

629
00:42:48,602 --> 00:42:49,664
Oh, Ben, seriously!

630
00:42:50,219 --> 00:42:51,268
Before you go flirting,

631
00:42:51,293 --> 00:42:54,040
remember why we're busting
our asses here.

632
00:42:55,397 --> 00:42:56,690
Of course, I get it.

633
00:42:57,916 --> 00:43:00,875
Here's the receipt
for the money sent.

634
00:43:04,573 --> 00:43:05,407
I'll head out.

635
00:43:08,034 --> 00:43:08,577
See you.

636
00:43:21,631 --> 00:43:22,591
This has been here a while.

637
00:43:24,843 --> 00:43:25,427
Here you go,

638
00:43:25,969 --> 00:43:27,179
this should cover you for a week.

639
00:43:27,387 --> 00:43:28,805
Oh, thanks!

640
00:43:28,805 --> 00:43:29,848
That's for your rent.

641
00:43:31,278 --> 00:43:32,445
Should I count it?

642
00:43:32,767 --> 00:43:33,560
Thank you!

643
00:43:51,161 --> 00:43:52,162
We're on!

644
00:43:53,830 --> 00:43:54,539
Line up.

645
00:43:55,415 --> 00:43:57,334
Alright, single file, single file.

646
00:43:57,459 --> 00:43:58,960
Out of the way,
five hundred.

647
00:43:59,127 --> 00:44:01,004
Queue up properly!

648
00:44:03,632 --> 00:44:04,716
Your ticket, your ticket.

649
00:44:05,133 --> 00:44:05,759
And you?

650
00:44:06,218 --> 00:44:07,594
I'm all in five hundred.

651
00:44:09,095 --> 00:44:10,472
- That's another bet.
- How about you?

652
00:44:10,889 --> 00:44:12,057
This is the last fight, guys!

653
00:44:12,933 --> 00:44:14,726
Bro, we're not gonna
get raided here, right?

654
00:44:14,751 --> 00:44:15,935
That's Marlon.

655
00:44:16,102 --> 00:44:18,730
He's bankrolling this place.

656
00:44:19,773 --> 00:44:22,901
Gives a cut for this building.

657
00:44:22,901 --> 00:44:26,071
See? He's being protected here.

658
00:44:26,071 --> 00:44:29,491
Ten percent. For example,
if you bet a hundred,

659
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:33,036
you only get ninety back.

660
00:45:03,483 --> 00:45:08,822
Abby, can you get me a Sisig
and Crispy pata? For upstairs.

661
00:45:09,781 --> 00:45:10,699
Thanks.

662
00:45:12,492 --> 00:45:13,368
Miss!

663
00:45:13,368 --> 00:45:15,245
Man, they're wild in there.

664
00:45:16,060 --> 00:45:17,096
Miss!

665
00:45:19,624 --> 00:45:20,586
Sir?

666
00:45:21,126 --> 00:45:22,195
You want another beer?

667
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:23,468
Can I take you out?

668
00:45:23,732 --> 00:45:26,501
I'm just a waitress here, sir!

669
00:45:26,589 --> 00:45:28,091
Come on, I got you.

670
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:29,150
No, sir, please.

671
00:45:29,175 --> 00:45:30,760
- I'll take care of you.
- I'm just a waitress here.

672
00:45:31,011 --> 00:45:31,678
Come on!

673
00:45:32,304 --> 00:45:32,887
Sir!

674
00:45:33,305 --> 00:45:34,097
No, sir.

675
00:45:34,222 --> 00:45:35,187
Sir!

676
00:45:38,310 --> 00:45:39,561
- Domeng! Domeng!
- Help!

677
00:45:40,353 --> 00:45:42,355
- Abby! Abby!
- Sir, you're wasted!

678
00:45:42,492 --> 00:45:44,541
- Abby, pull Ana out!
- Come on, he's drunk! He's drunk!

679
00:45:44,566 --> 00:45:45,692
I just wanted to order.

680
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:46,818
Go on, go on.

681
00:45:46,843 --> 00:45:48,258
She's too snooty!

682
00:45:49,421 --> 00:45:50,380
- I was just gonna order!
- You're drunk!

683
00:45:50,405 --> 00:45:51,031
You're high!

684
00:45:51,531 --> 00:45:52,812
Come back some other time.

685
00:45:58,371 --> 00:46:00,081
- You'll get used to it.
- Ana!

686
00:46:01,191 --> 00:46:02,320
Alright, I got this.

687
00:46:10,008 --> 00:46:12,677
Ana, you have to be patient,
he's drunk.

688
00:46:15,013 --> 00:46:16,806
Sir, it's not just that.

689
00:46:17,844 --> 00:46:20,793
He should know his limits.

690
00:46:22,771 --> 00:46:26,941
I get it, but next time,
just steer clear.

691
00:46:33,615 --> 00:46:35,742
Sir, why am I
the one in the wrong?

692
00:46:39,704 --> 00:46:41,206
I'm not saying you are.

693
00:46:43,158 --> 00:46:46,027
Alright, I'll get that guy banned.

694
00:46:52,149 --> 00:46:54,322
Sort this out,
we've got lots of customers.

695
00:46:54,578 --> 00:46:55,594
Go.

696
00:47:01,267 --> 00:47:02,519
Damn it!

697
00:47:03,686 --> 00:47:04,562
Come on!

698
00:47:04,587 --> 00:47:05,422
Get him!

699
00:47:14,797 --> 00:47:15,891
Black wins!

700
00:47:20,073 --> 00:47:21,422
Alright, get the other bets in!

701
00:47:22,915 --> 00:47:24,290
Place yours.

702
00:47:27,602 --> 00:47:30,688
Boss, two hundred on black.

703
00:47:30,713 --> 00:47:31,631
Place your bets!

704
00:47:31,631 --> 00:47:32,465
Black, two hundred.

705
00:47:32,465 --> 00:47:33,049
Black.

706
00:47:33,074 --> 00:47:34,242
You? How much?

707
00:47:35,510 --> 00:47:36,594
Place your bets here.

708
00:47:36,594 --> 00:47:37,470
Okay we're starting,

709
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:38,638
Here, here.

710
00:47:38,638 --> 00:47:39,514
no more bets?

711
00:47:54,195 --> 00:47:55,447
Come on! Fight back!

712
00:47:56,531 --> 00:47:57,657
Fight back!

713
00:48:03,621 --> 00:48:04,622
Damn it!

714
00:48:10,462 --> 00:48:11,629
Looks like you're on a losing streak.

715
00:48:12,172 --> 00:48:13,389
You still wanna bet?

716
00:48:15,773 --> 00:48:16,996
I'm all out, boss.

717
00:48:17,650 --> 00:48:19,507
If you want,
I can spot you?

718
00:48:31,649 --> 00:48:33,860
Here's fifteen grand so you
can get back in the game.

719
00:48:36,404 --> 00:48:37,030
Alright, boss.

720
00:48:37,984 --> 00:48:39,578
But you'll pay me back, right?

721
00:48:39,949 --> 00:48:40,742
Place your bets again!

722
00:48:41,534 --> 00:48:42,672
Take this one's bet.

723
00:48:43,578 --> 00:48:44,930
Did you place yours already?

724
00:48:45,455 --> 00:48:47,248
Alright, black or white?!

725
00:48:48,969 --> 00:48:50,201
How much, boss?

726
00:48:51,611 --> 00:48:52,854
Two grand.

727
00:48:52,879 --> 00:48:54,087
Two thousand.
Where are you placing it?

728
00:48:55,436 --> 00:48:56,407
Black? White?

729
00:48:58,506 --> 00:48:59,555
Black.

730
00:49:14,234 --> 00:49:14,984
Goddammit.

731
00:49:14,984 --> 00:49:15,818
Come on, get it!

732
00:49:17,070 --> 00:49:17,946
Fight back!

733
00:49:41,511 --> 00:49:42,571
Honey,

734
00:49:43,638 --> 00:49:45,014
sun's up already.

735
00:49:55,116 --> 00:49:56,399
I had to do overtime.

736
00:49:59,169 --> 00:50:01,555
It was packed earlier.

737
00:50:02,735 --> 00:50:03,992
My head's killing me.

738
00:50:05,552 --> 00:50:06,594
You okay, love?

739
00:50:06,619 --> 00:50:08,454
I'm fine, I'm okay.

740
00:50:08,479 --> 00:50:10,857
- Want some meds?
- No, no. I just need to...

741
00:50:12,333 --> 00:50:13,418
shut my eyes for a bit.

742
00:50:14,109 --> 00:50:16,947
Let's... let's talk tomorrow.

743
00:51:11,326 --> 00:51:12,160
Hello, Ma!

744
00:51:12,185 --> 00:51:14,479
It's been a long time
since we last talked, dear.

745
00:51:14,504 --> 00:51:15,546
How are you doing?

746
00:51:15,772 --> 00:51:18,191
Why aren't you calling?
Are you doing fine?

747
00:51:18,249 --> 00:51:20,668
- I'm starting to worry.
- Oh--

748
00:51:20,693 --> 00:51:23,422
Ma, don't worry too much about me.

749
00:51:23,988 --> 00:51:26,115
Are you eating on time?

750
00:51:26,574 --> 00:51:28,034
How's Anton?

751
00:51:28,618 --> 00:51:30,995
He's fine. Anton and I are fine.

752
00:51:31,579 --> 00:51:33,706
We're always able to make do.

753
00:51:34,807 --> 00:51:38,359
Alright, Ma,
I'll send money today.

754
00:51:39,187 --> 00:51:41,022
I'll just transfer it on e-cash, okay?

755
00:51:41,047 --> 00:51:42,690
Thank you so much my dear.

756
00:51:42,715 --> 00:51:44,313
That'll be a huge help on us.

757
00:51:44,338 --> 00:51:46,006
Okay, take care.

758
00:51:46,031 --> 00:51:47,199
Okay, Ma.

759
00:52:40,432 --> 00:52:41,416
Hey, manager.

760
00:52:41,441 --> 00:52:42,150
Good evening, sir.

761
00:52:42,150 --> 00:52:43,209
Good evening.

762
00:52:43,234 --> 00:52:43,943
Take care of this.

763
00:52:43,968 --> 00:52:45,736
- Okay.
- How are we doing?

764
00:52:45,945 --> 00:52:48,165
Slow night, sir.

765
00:52:49,096 --> 00:52:50,672
Are there customers upstairs?

766
00:52:50,697 --> 00:52:52,633
Yeah but just one table.

767
00:52:53,047 --> 00:52:54,529
That's better than nothing.

768
00:52:54,696 --> 00:52:57,070
When they're done,
we pack up.

769
00:52:57,203 --> 00:52:58,705
Our electricity bill's getting too high.

770
00:52:59,125 --> 00:53:00,293
- Okay, sir.
- Okay.

771
00:53:01,961 --> 00:53:04,338
This sucks, we have no customers.

772
00:53:04,547 --> 00:53:08,637
I didn't know there
will be nights like this.

773
00:53:08,662 --> 00:53:10,461
That's normal here.

774
00:53:12,492 --> 00:53:15,687
Would you like to
apply as a dancer?

775
00:53:16,212 --> 00:53:17,281
Hold on.

776
00:53:18,172 --> 00:53:19,250
Hello, babe?

777
00:53:40,041 --> 00:53:41,250
I'll be going to the market.

778
00:53:41,918 --> 00:53:42,877
That your list?

779
00:53:43,085 --> 00:53:43,795
Mhm.

780
00:53:46,547 --> 00:53:47,715
Here, have some coffee.

781
00:53:52,011 --> 00:53:54,138
Here, love,
I hope that's enough for now.

782
00:53:55,348 --> 00:53:58,142
Bro, Ana's going to the market,
you need anything?

783
00:53:58,392 --> 00:53:59,644
Hold on a sec.

784
00:54:00,186 --> 00:54:00,895
Yeah, I do.

785
00:54:04,878 --> 00:54:06,233
Ana, can you grab me some...

786
00:54:06,615 --> 00:54:11,172
maybe three kilos of pork
and some veggies for a stew?

787
00:54:11,197 --> 00:54:12,280
Here you go.

788
00:54:13,608 --> 00:54:15,182
That's Ben's favorite.

789
00:54:15,319 --> 00:54:16,661
Really? Oh, right.

790
00:54:16,843 --> 00:54:18,120
I've got a list here.

791
00:54:18,834 --> 00:54:20,641
And if anything's missing,

792
00:54:20,932 --> 00:54:22,809
just grab it and
deduct from this, okay?

793
00:54:22,834 --> 00:54:24,257
- Sure thing.
- You got this.

794
00:54:26,890 --> 00:54:28,644
Babe, I'm heading out first.

795
00:54:30,757 --> 00:54:31,801
Keys.

796
00:54:38,963 --> 00:54:40,138
I'll go ahead.

797
00:54:40,393 --> 00:54:41,310
Thanks.

798
00:54:42,298 --> 00:54:43,358
Who hasn't paid yet?

799
00:54:43,729 --> 00:54:45,648
That's Anabelle, and Paco.

800
00:54:45,885 --> 00:54:47,720
Barbie and Panyero, too.

801
00:54:48,113 --> 00:54:50,583
We'll go broke.
Collect from them.

802
00:54:51,228 --> 00:54:52,671
Alright, boss, later.

803
00:54:57,061 --> 00:54:58,084
Hello!

804
00:55:02,999 --> 00:55:04,578
Hey, hold onto this.

805
00:55:06,627 --> 00:55:08,045
Wait for me, okay?

806
00:55:08,744 --> 00:55:09,757
Ben!

807
00:55:10,695 --> 00:55:11,699
They're calling you.

808
00:55:12,740 --> 00:55:13,526
I'm off.

809
00:55:13,551 --> 00:55:15,461
I told you, I'm on my way.

810
00:55:22,901 --> 00:55:23,948
What's up?

811
00:55:25,675 --> 00:55:27,276
Dude, sorry,
I've got nothing right now.

812
00:55:27,526 --> 00:55:28,589
When?

813
00:55:28,862 --> 00:55:31,219
Maybe next week, dude.

814
00:55:31,649 --> 00:55:35,044
Problem is, I need it now.

815
00:55:35,745 --> 00:55:37,466
I told you I'm broke right now.

816
00:55:37,491 --> 00:55:39,316
It's not like I'm running away
with your money.

817
00:55:41,675 --> 00:55:42,747
What did you say?

818
00:55:43,886 --> 00:55:45,072
Am I bugging you?

819
00:55:46,409 --> 00:55:48,143
You taking me for a fool, huh?
You son of a bitch.

820
00:55:49,020 --> 00:55:50,479
What did you say?

821
00:55:50,504 --> 00:55:51,550
Screw you, too!

822
00:55:51,589 --> 00:55:53,653
You have the balls to act like that?

823
00:55:53,678 --> 00:55:54,941
Son of a bitch!

824
00:56:08,702 --> 00:56:09,867
Hold him up.

825
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:11,102
Hold him!

826
00:56:11,127 --> 00:56:12,180
Damn you!

827
00:56:14,218 --> 00:56:15,289
Get him up! Get him up!

828
00:56:16,726 --> 00:56:17,985
Asshole!

829
00:56:18,102 --> 00:56:19,249
What now?!

830
00:56:21,410 --> 00:56:22,438
On your knees!

831
00:56:28,584 --> 00:56:29,712
Come here!

832
00:56:35,219 --> 00:56:36,782
You goddamn animal!

833
00:56:37,468 --> 00:56:38,569
No, please.

834
00:56:38,594 --> 00:56:40,149
I could kill you right now.

835
00:56:41,081 --> 00:56:44,103
You have the gall to borrow money,
you should pay up!

836
00:56:45,515 --> 00:56:47,078
Lon, stop it!

837
00:56:47,103 --> 00:56:48,479
- Stop that.
- What?

838
00:56:48,504 --> 00:56:49,722
- Drop it!
- Damn you all.

839
00:56:50,398 --> 00:56:51,673
Stand down!

840
00:56:51,780 --> 00:56:52,837
Stop that!

841
00:56:55,056 --> 00:56:56,212
You've got some nerve!

842
00:56:56,599 --> 00:56:58,294
Hey! Drop your gun!

843
00:56:58,641 --> 00:56:59,829
Drop it!

844
00:57:03,366 --> 00:57:04,407
Get out of here!

845
00:57:07,769 --> 00:57:09,345
You better warn your friend!

846
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:11,382
Let's go!

847
00:57:31,812 --> 00:57:32,845
Jeez.

848
00:57:34,032 --> 00:57:35,059
Here.

849
00:57:36,853 --> 00:57:37,853
Use this.

850
00:57:40,142 --> 00:57:41,306
How's the injury?

851
00:57:48,766 --> 00:57:50,477
You messed up man.

852
00:57:51,117 --> 00:57:53,308
Didn't you tell me you'd save up?

853
00:57:53,649 --> 00:57:54,657
Right?

854
00:57:55,974 --> 00:57:57,520
How much do you owe Marlon?

855
00:58:00,597 --> 00:58:01,813
15 thousand.

856
00:58:02,370 --> 00:58:04,438
You lost fifteen grand gambling?

857
00:58:04,706 --> 00:58:06,613
What the hell were you thinking?

858
00:58:07,950 --> 00:58:09,407
Bro, what do I do?

859
00:58:10,495 --> 00:58:12,830
Maybe you have some cash?
Can you lend me some?

860
00:58:12,855 --> 00:58:13,355
Nope!

861
00:58:13,631 --> 00:58:16,098
I've got my own problems too.

862
00:58:18,755 --> 00:58:20,907
Just make sure Ana
doesn't find out, okay?

863
00:58:21,212 --> 00:58:22,837
She'd be furious.

864
00:58:23,084 --> 00:58:26,633
You know, if I just knew a
quick way to make money.

865
00:58:28,719 --> 00:58:29,939
Quick cash.

866
00:58:30,974 --> 00:58:34,423
These days... people buy
sex videos.

867
00:58:35,085 --> 00:58:37,016
That's quick. Big money.

868
00:58:37,493 --> 00:58:38,732
If you've got some.

869
00:58:42,355 --> 00:58:46,118
But that Marlon,
that guy's bad news.

870
00:58:47,958 --> 00:58:49,364
You need to pay him.

871
00:58:54,594 --> 00:58:55,676
I gotta go.

872
00:59:15,516 --> 00:59:16,807
Ben, what's wrong?

873
00:59:18,321 --> 00:59:19,395
What happened?

874
00:59:21,673 --> 00:59:22,792
Love, it's nothing.

875
00:59:23,171 --> 00:59:26,821
It's not nothing!
I heard Marlon beat you up.

876
00:59:27,286 --> 00:59:29,352
Marlon didn't lay a finger on me.

877
00:59:34,032 --> 00:59:35,313
How much do you owe him?

878
00:59:44,435 --> 00:59:45,789
Fifteen grand.

879
00:59:50,812 --> 00:59:52,774
You gambled that much?

880
00:59:55,305 --> 00:59:56,641
I lost, okay?

881
00:59:59,232 --> 01:00:01,735
Why'd you risk our money?

882
01:00:06,220 --> 01:00:07,550
Ana, I'm sorry.

883
01:00:08,207 --> 01:00:11,446
But don't forget,
whatever it is you're thinking...

884
01:00:11,471 --> 01:00:12,665
win or lose,

885
01:00:12,740 --> 01:00:15,118
I'm doing this for our future.

886
01:00:15,329 --> 01:00:16,564
No, Ben!

887
01:00:17,243 --> 01:00:20,040
You're gambling our future away!

888
01:00:25,279 --> 01:00:26,544
Damn it!

889
01:00:27,381 --> 01:00:30,034
Where are you gonna get
the money to pay him?

890
01:00:33,243 --> 01:00:34,650
Ana, wait! Babe!

891
01:00:50,304 --> 01:00:50,846
Dude,

892
01:00:51,608 --> 01:00:53,545
can you take me to table five?

893
01:00:58,871 --> 01:00:59,413
Hey!

894
01:00:59,438 --> 01:01:01,123
So Ben, what's up?
Care to pay up?

895
01:01:01,478 --> 01:01:02,746
Man, I'm so sorry,

896
01:01:02,771 --> 01:01:04,818
I'm just swamped
at work right now.

897
01:01:05,653 --> 01:01:07,196
Are you messing with me?

898
01:01:07,221 --> 01:01:08,764
Looks like you're not paying anymore.

899
01:01:09,990 --> 01:01:13,373
Look, I haven't gotten
back on my feet yet.

900
01:01:14,132 --> 01:01:17,935
Am I the one to blame for your shit?
I need that dough.

901
01:01:19,330 --> 01:01:21,303
I'm not avoiding you,

902
01:01:21,883 --> 01:01:24,411
we live in the same place!

903
01:01:24,770 --> 01:01:25,969
Just a reminder.

904
01:01:26,142 --> 01:01:28,467
Debts are meant to be paid

905
01:01:29,022 --> 01:01:31,359
if you don't want
anything happening to you.

906
01:01:33,318 --> 01:01:35,363
Alright, alright, I'll pay, okay?

907
01:01:47,967 --> 01:01:49,131
This could work.

908
01:01:49,857 --> 01:01:52,238
Your friend seems
to be in deep water, huh?

909
01:01:53,905 --> 01:01:55,004
You sure about this?

910
01:01:55,959 --> 01:01:57,052
Are you?

911
01:02:00,374 --> 01:02:03,942
Looks like your friend's
getting cold feet, Mando.

912
01:02:06,145 --> 01:02:07,180
Ben?

913
01:02:07,795 --> 01:02:09,132
Ben! He's talking to you.

914
01:02:11,726 --> 01:02:15,183
Sir, can you mask the face,
like, just a square?

915
01:02:15,208 --> 01:02:17,407
Oh, pixelated? Blurred?

916
01:02:17,432 --> 01:02:18,974
- Yeah, pixelated.
- We can do that.

917
01:02:19,708 --> 01:02:22,208
But what a waste.

918
01:02:23,042 --> 01:02:24,579
This is good stuff.

919
01:02:28,326 --> 01:02:34,916
Or maybe just zoom in so the eyes
and mouth are out of frame.

920
01:02:34,941 --> 01:02:37,554
You're friend's too demanding.

921
01:02:37,788 --> 01:02:38,896
Mando.

922
01:02:43,499 --> 01:02:44,584
Ben?

923
01:02:45,268 --> 01:02:46,897
you've got to decide.

924
01:02:52,384 --> 01:02:53,260
Sir, this is fine.

925
01:02:54,345 --> 01:02:55,726
- Alright, alright, this'll do.
- Got it.

926
01:02:56,243 --> 01:02:57,339
Alright, get a copy.

927
01:02:59,850 --> 01:03:00,476
Vin?

928
01:03:01,643 --> 01:03:02,603
withdraw fifteen for me.

929
01:03:03,187 --> 01:03:03,812
Alright.

930
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:05,189
It's fifteen grand, right?

931
01:03:06,482 --> 01:03:07,483
Yeah, fifteen.

932
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:09,276
Then go get fifteen.

933
01:03:14,387 --> 01:03:15,435
Dude,

934
01:03:17,145 --> 01:03:18,270
check this out.

935
01:03:19,856 --> 01:03:21,042
Isn't that Ana?

936
01:03:22,559 --> 01:03:24,214
She's done for.

937
01:03:25,225 --> 01:03:28,228
Tasyo, one sisig,
one crispy pata,

938
01:03:28,253 --> 01:03:30,388
one boneless bangus.

939
01:03:31,762 --> 01:03:33,107
That's Ana!

940
01:03:34,038 --> 01:03:35,356
Where did you find this?

941
01:03:35,381 --> 01:03:36,716
that's what's viral now.

942
01:03:36,741 --> 01:03:37,614
Give it here!

943
01:03:43,471 --> 01:03:44,582
Ana!

944
01:03:59,458 --> 01:04:00,925
What's going on over there?

945
01:04:03,282 --> 01:04:04,739
Ana! Abby!

946
01:04:06,699 --> 01:04:07,708
Hey!

947
01:04:48,542 --> 01:04:49,835
Ben, what happened?

948
01:04:58,051 --> 01:04:59,511
Ben, how could you do that?

949
01:05:05,684 --> 01:05:07,742
Ben, talk to me!

950
01:05:07,767 --> 01:05:09,560
Look at me, Ben!

951
01:05:12,506 --> 01:05:13,550
Ben!

952
01:05:14,816 --> 01:05:16,778
Ben, talk to me!

953
01:05:20,782 --> 01:05:22,493
How could you do that to me?

954
01:05:22,493 --> 01:05:24,966
Talk to me, Ben.

955
01:05:26,895 --> 01:05:28,052
Ben!

956
01:05:57,069 --> 01:06:00,856
You asshole!
You humiliated me!

957
01:06:00,881 --> 01:06:01,507
Babe...

958
01:06:01,532 --> 01:06:02,617
Just wait.

959
01:06:03,457 --> 01:06:04,475
Wait a minute!

960
01:06:04,593 --> 01:06:05,469
Damn you!

961
01:06:05,494 --> 01:06:06,303
I can explain...

962
01:06:06,328 --> 01:06:07,466
Just wait!

963
01:06:07,491 --> 01:06:08,117
Babe!

964
01:06:09,456 --> 01:06:10,274
Babe, I'm so sorry!

965
01:06:12,334 --> 01:06:14,438
- Babe, please, I'm so sorry!
- You humiliated me!

966
01:06:15,224 --> 01:06:16,710
Babe, I'm so sorry!

967
01:06:17,714 --> 01:06:19,024
Damn you, Ben!

968
01:06:19,049 --> 01:06:19,992
Babe!

969
01:06:20,092 --> 01:06:20,884
You humiliated me!

970
01:06:20,909 --> 01:06:22,536
Babe, enough, enough.

971
01:06:22,928 --> 01:06:23,971
Babe, stop it!

972
01:06:24,586 --> 01:06:26,223
Babe, please.

973
01:06:26,365 --> 01:06:27,616
Enough.

974
01:06:27,641 --> 01:06:29,617
You screwed me over.

975
01:06:31,728 --> 01:06:33,622
You humiliated me!

976
01:06:33,647 --> 01:06:34,837
Ben!

977
01:06:36,567 --> 01:06:37,859
I'm so sorry, so sorry.

978
01:06:38,313 --> 01:06:40,376
What did you do?

979
01:06:40,462 --> 01:06:41,171
I'm sorry!

980
01:06:41,196 --> 01:06:43,657
What did you do?

981
01:06:45,907 --> 01:06:48,195
I'm so sorry,
babe, so sorry!

982
01:06:52,583 --> 01:06:54,001
Sorry, so sorry!

983
01:06:55,627 --> 01:06:58,330
- I'm so sorry.
- What happened, Ben?

984
01:07:02,293 --> 01:07:03,361
Goddammit!

985
01:07:04,275 --> 01:07:05,304
Shit!

986
01:08:16,547 --> 01:08:17,882
Forget about her!

987
01:08:18,554 --> 01:08:20,677
I'm sure she's blocked you already.

988
01:08:21,500 --> 01:08:22,913
It's been a year, man!

989
01:08:23,609 --> 01:08:25,152
You were such an idiot!

990
01:08:25,177 --> 01:08:27,899
I just hoped she'd have
forgiven me by now.

991
01:08:29,414 --> 01:08:31,231
What you did was so messed up!

992
01:08:32,182 --> 01:08:33,725
Who in their right mind would,

993
01:08:33,967 --> 01:08:36,078
sell a video of their girlfriend?

994
01:08:37,375 --> 01:08:39,147
Look, I admit it was wrong.

995
01:08:41,066 --> 01:08:42,067
Move on already!

996
01:08:43,777 --> 01:08:46,613
She might've married
someone else by now.

997
01:09:00,043 --> 01:09:01,086
There they are.
Let's go!

998
01:09:02,337 --> 01:09:04,047
- Mr. Brown!
- You're running late.

999
01:09:04,398 --> 01:09:05,565
Ah, yeah, my bad.

1000
01:09:05,590 --> 01:09:08,176
I mean, she got caught
in the traffic jam.

1001
01:09:08,201 --> 01:09:09,580
You take forever to get ready.

1002
01:09:09,642 --> 01:09:10,821
Oh, no biggie.

1003
01:09:10,846 --> 01:09:12,055
But seriously, I'm sorry.

1004
01:09:12,305 --> 01:09:14,516
By the way, Mr. Brown,
this is Melody.

1005
01:09:14,541 --> 01:09:15,584
- Hi Melody!
- Melody.

1006
01:09:15,609 --> 01:09:16,605
Shake his hand.

1007
01:09:18,691 --> 01:09:19,864
You two make a cute couple.

1008
01:09:20,480 --> 01:09:21,629
- Hey!
- Mando!

1009
01:09:21,922 --> 01:09:23,956
Your bar's packed tonight.

1010
01:09:23,981 --> 01:09:25,307
You're raking it in!

1011
01:09:25,809 --> 01:09:27,003
Just lucky.

1012
01:09:27,028 --> 01:09:30,032
You know Sarge,
he's great with promotions

1013
01:09:30,057 --> 01:09:32,551
and has a ton of connections.

1014
01:09:32,576 --> 01:09:33,925
He's got the magic touch.

1015
01:09:34,215 --> 01:09:35,219
Right?

1016
01:09:36,138 --> 01:09:37,139
Congrats again!

1017
01:09:37,164 --> 01:09:38,165
Thank you, really.

1018
01:09:39,332 --> 01:09:39,833
Hey!

1019
01:09:39,858 --> 01:09:43,570
Sarge, congrats!
The bar's buzzing tonight.

1020
01:09:44,179 --> 01:09:45,147
What's the deal?

1021
01:09:45,172 --> 01:09:48,467
Ah, I just dropped off a girl,

1022
01:09:48,492 --> 01:09:51,694
for one of our regulars, Mr. Brown.

1023
01:09:52,171 --> 01:09:54,947
Had a delivery to make,
you know the drill.

1024
01:09:54,973 --> 01:09:57,709
I made my buck, time to head out.

1025
01:09:58,977 --> 01:10:00,687
You're one of a kind, buddy.

1026
01:10:00,954 --> 01:10:02,664
- Take care, alright.
- Nice to see you again!

1027
01:10:02,689 --> 01:10:03,732
Pop by sometime.

1028
01:10:03,757 --> 01:10:04,938
Sure thing, Sarge!

1029
01:10:04,963 --> 01:10:05,981
Ana!

1030
01:10:06,231 --> 01:10:07,239
Take care!

1031
01:10:10,454 --> 01:10:12,990
That guy's got a way with women, huh.

1032
01:10:13,510 --> 01:10:15,561
But we got lucky with Mando, right?

1033
01:10:16,056 --> 01:10:18,483
If not for him,
we wouldn't have met.

1034
01:10:19,826 --> 01:10:22,072
By the way, I can't make it tonight.

1035
01:10:22,536 --> 01:10:25,467
Got to rise and shine
early tomorrow, school affair.

1036
01:10:26,272 --> 01:10:27,662
No worries, it's cool.

1037
01:10:28,090 --> 01:10:29,024
You sure?

1038
01:10:29,049 --> 01:10:29,716
Yeah, no sweat.

1039
01:10:29,741 --> 01:10:30,928
I'll make it up to you.

1040
01:10:35,845 --> 01:10:37,350
Good evening, Sir!
How are you?

1041
01:10:40,959 --> 01:10:44,006
What matters is
we're good now, right?

1042
01:10:44,865 --> 01:10:46,108
If you've got an issue,

1043
01:10:46,133 --> 01:10:48,623
- call the cops on him.
- Ma'am, here's the receipt.

1044
01:10:52,940 --> 01:10:56,233
Alright, ma, I gotta run.
My ride's here.

1045
01:10:57,139 --> 01:10:58,161
Bye!

1046
01:11:19,683 --> 01:11:20,392
Oh my gosh, Hon!

1047
01:11:20,392 --> 01:11:21,768
- It's driving me nuts!
- Good afternoon, ma'am.

1048
01:11:21,977 --> 01:11:23,103
What's so "good"
about this afternoon?

1049
01:11:23,812 --> 01:11:24,437
This is so frustrating!

1050
01:11:24,462 --> 01:11:25,922
Didn't you see what they did?

1051
01:11:25,947 --> 01:11:27,833
- Yeah, I saw.
- They trash-talked me.

1052
01:11:27,858 --> 01:11:29,818
They can't see all the effort I put in,

1053
01:11:29,843 --> 01:11:31,970
everything I do for them,
always providing aid.

1054
01:11:31,995 --> 01:11:33,463
- You're right, you're right.
- It's so infuriating!

1055
01:11:33,488 --> 01:11:34,840
I get it! Just take a deep breath.

1056
01:11:34,865 --> 01:11:37,909
Can't they see I'm the one
feeding them all the time?!

1057
01:11:37,934 --> 01:11:40,467
Whenever they need food!

1058
01:11:40,492 --> 01:11:42,686
Who's there during the relief? Who?

1059
01:11:42,750 --> 01:11:44,102
Me! I'm always there!

1060
01:11:44,127 --> 01:11:46,729
When they need school supplies,
I'm there.

1061
01:11:46,768 --> 01:11:47,894
- Exactly.
- The nerve of those people!

1062
01:11:47,919 --> 01:11:49,504
After which they belittle me like that.

1063
01:11:49,529 --> 01:11:50,811
Can't they...

1064
01:11:50,936 --> 01:11:52,399
Ugh, I'm so stressed out!

1065
01:11:52,424 --> 01:11:54,234
Where's my drink,
what's taking so long?!

1066
01:11:54,259 --> 01:11:55,443
Get her drink, please!

1067
01:11:55,468 --> 01:11:56,592
Hurry up!

1068
01:11:56,617 --> 01:11:58,573
I'm always there for them!

1069
01:11:58,697 --> 01:12:00,031
Aren't some of them still
indebted to you?

1070
01:12:00,056 --> 01:12:01,558
- It's so annoying!
- Yes.

1071
01:12:01,583 --> 01:12:03,118
Ugh! I'm so stressed out.

1072
01:12:03,143 --> 01:12:03,977
I really am!

1073
01:12:04,002 --> 01:12:04,711
Gosh!

1074
01:12:05,583 --> 01:12:06,459
My--

1075
01:12:06,484 --> 01:12:08,296
My drink,
what's the delay?!

1076
01:12:08,460 --> 01:12:09,478
Come on!

1077
01:12:09,566 --> 01:12:10,650
This is too much,

1078
01:12:10,675 --> 01:12:11,843
- it's been forever!
- Relax.

1079
01:12:12,068 --> 01:12:12,711
No!

1080
01:12:12,736 --> 01:12:14,615
Cordapio, get my cigarettes!

1081
01:12:14,971 --> 01:12:18,008
They're getting on my
nerves, Hon. So frustrating!

1082
01:12:18,033 --> 01:12:19,718
I need to call my amiga.

1083
01:12:19,743 --> 01:12:21,678
Isn't it embarrassing!
You know...

1084
01:12:21,703 --> 01:12:25,373
I can't... I won't forgive them!

1085
01:12:25,675 --> 01:12:27,795
What they're doing to me,
just no!

1086
01:12:30,326 --> 01:12:31,332
Hello?

1087
01:12:31,540 --> 01:12:32,583
Sis!

1088
01:12:32,724 --> 01:12:35,686
Did you see what they did?
They embarrassed me!

1089
01:12:35,880 --> 01:12:38,576
Don't they realize
I'm the one funding them?

1090
01:12:38,601 --> 01:12:39,615
For everything!

1091
01:12:39,640 --> 01:12:40,420
Right?

1092
01:12:44,267 --> 01:12:45,352
What's up with Madam?

1093
01:12:45,377 --> 01:12:47,553
- They're belittling me too much!
- Just ignore them.

1094
01:12:47,604 --> 01:12:50,190
It's not worth the headache.

1095
01:12:50,215 --> 01:12:52,545
That Roberta, she's too much
with her criticism!

1096
01:12:52,570 --> 01:12:57,172
By the way, my colonel friends
are coming over later.

1097
01:12:57,197 --> 01:12:58,483
I'm stressed, Mars!

1098
01:12:59,413 --> 01:13:01,858
I might come over
to your place later.

1099
01:13:06,516 --> 01:13:08,873
Yeah, I'll see you!

1100
01:13:09,184 --> 01:13:13,355
Hey, you need to gather
influential people to be with us

1101
01:13:13,380 --> 01:13:16,100
because I can't accept
what they're doing to me!

1102
01:13:16,610 --> 01:13:18,091
Hon, I'm leaving!

1103
01:13:18,859 --> 01:13:20,858
I'll... be there.

1104
01:14:17,610 --> 01:14:18,570
Ma!

1105
01:14:19,112 --> 01:14:20,338
I'll start the rice.

1106
01:14:20,363 --> 01:14:22,465
Alright, dear.
I'll be right there.

1107
01:14:22,490 --> 01:14:24,384
I'll cook, just a sec, okay?

1108
01:14:24,409 --> 01:14:25,696
- Sure.
- I'm done here.

1109
01:14:32,555 --> 01:14:33,656
Let's go.

1110
01:14:55,307 --> 01:14:56,207
Stephen.

1111
01:14:56,232 --> 01:14:58,516
Oh, alright, cool name.

1112
01:14:59,691 --> 01:15:00,788
Waiter!

1113
01:15:01,652 --> 01:15:05,539
Hey waiter,
table seven over here.

1114
01:15:10,593 --> 01:15:11,778
- Check.
- Check.

1115
01:15:11,803 --> 01:15:13,203
- Call.
- Call.

1116
01:15:13,429 --> 01:15:14,727
- Call.
- Call.

1117
01:15:18,064 --> 01:15:19,469
- All in.
- All in.

1118
01:15:20,608 --> 01:15:22,524
Call, sir?

1119
01:15:24,805 --> 01:15:26,163
Call for all in, sir.

1120
01:15:28,448 --> 01:15:29,991
- All in.
- Call for the all in.

1121
01:15:30,016 --> 01:15:31,532
Sir? Call?

1122
01:15:31,976 --> 01:15:34,020
- All in.
- Matching the all in.

1123
01:15:35,281 --> 01:15:36,582
Show cards, please.

1124
01:15:39,734 --> 01:15:40,753
Flush.

1125
01:15:41,992 --> 01:15:43,142
Show, please.

1126
01:15:44,656 --> 01:15:45,875
Flush wins.

1127
01:15:49,937 --> 01:15:51,457
Okay.

1128
01:15:52,804 --> 01:15:54,212
Thank you, Lord!

1129
01:15:54,236 --> 01:15:55,489
You're on a roll, huh?

1130
01:16:02,118 --> 01:16:03,185
Unlucky!

1131
01:16:05,787 --> 01:16:07,773
Come with me,
just this once.

1132
01:16:08,108 --> 01:16:09,364
I've wanted to get to know
you for so long.

1133
01:16:09,389 --> 01:16:10,765
Alright, have fun over there.

1134
01:16:10,765 --> 01:16:11,683
Just for a while.

1135
01:16:11,708 --> 01:16:14,953
So crowded yet
nothing's paying off.

1136
01:16:14,978 --> 01:16:16,235
Give me a cigarette.

1137
01:16:17,999 --> 01:16:19,352
Just a sec.

1138
01:16:19,605 --> 01:16:21,539
I've been coming here for ages.

1139
01:16:21,969 --> 01:16:23,072
Come on.

1140
01:16:23,293 --> 01:16:24,368
I'm sorry sir.

1141
01:16:25,102 --> 01:16:27,632
Come on.
There are a lot--

1142
01:16:27,657 --> 01:16:29,891
No, really, please.

1143
01:16:34,864 --> 01:16:35,823
Hurry up.

1144
01:16:35,848 --> 01:16:37,058
I still have work to do.

1145
01:16:37,083 --> 01:16:38,042
Buddy!

1146
01:16:38,067 --> 01:16:40,008
- Hey!
- What are you up to, Warden?

1147
01:16:40,407 --> 01:16:42,230
You're being a bit...

1148
01:16:42,255 --> 01:16:43,423
Leave the staff alone, man.

1149
01:16:43,448 --> 01:16:45,133
You're a bit handsy, huh?

1150
01:16:46,092 --> 01:16:48,236
Just inviting her to have fun.

1151
01:16:48,261 --> 01:16:51,030
I get it, but if they're
not into it, back off.

1152
01:16:51,055 --> 01:16:54,325
No means no, right?

1153
01:16:54,350 --> 01:16:55,875
She was into it!
What are you on about?!

1154
01:16:56,554 --> 01:16:58,737
- Dude.
- Mind your own business, okay?

1155
01:17:00,368 --> 01:17:02,167
I'm not meddling,
I'm just saying...

1156
01:17:02,192 --> 01:17:05,055
I told you to butt out!

1157
01:17:05,080 --> 01:17:07,305
Relax, man!

1158
01:17:13,953 --> 01:17:15,121
You bastard,
I know you! Asshole!

1159
01:17:15,146 --> 01:17:16,648
Sir, sir, calm down!

1160
01:17:16,673 --> 01:17:17,999
- Damn you!
- Stop it, Sir!

1161
01:17:17,999 --> 01:17:20,376
Don't you dare touch
the women here!

1162
01:17:20,401 --> 01:17:22,020
Our girls?

1163
01:17:22,045 --> 01:17:23,618
You son of a...

1164
01:17:25,410 --> 01:17:27,172
- Enough already, okay?
- Let go of me!

1165
01:17:27,204 --> 01:17:29,444
Get the hell out of here!

1166
01:17:29,469 --> 01:17:30,602
I'll end you!

1167
01:17:31,638 --> 01:17:33,547
- Damn it!
- Don't even try it.

1168
01:17:34,888 --> 01:17:36,352
You alright?

1169
01:17:39,493 --> 01:17:40,693
Damn...

1170
01:17:47,377 --> 01:17:48,445
Sorry,

1171
01:17:48,865 --> 01:17:50,218
sorry, everyone, guests.

1172
01:17:51,102 --> 01:17:52,242
My apologies!

1173
01:17:52,470 --> 01:17:54,613
Let's keep the party going.

1174
01:17:55,058 --> 01:17:56,184
- Sorry, sorry.
- No problem.

1175
01:17:56,209 --> 01:17:57,513
Old acquaintance.

1176
01:17:57,538 --> 01:17:58,331
He's a moron.

1177
01:17:58,356 --> 01:18:00,110
Alright. Bottoms up!

1178
01:18:00,135 --> 01:18:03,368
Guys, rock and roll. Come on!

1179
01:18:03,924 --> 01:18:05,078
Ana!

1180
01:18:06,109 --> 01:18:07,297
Ana!

1181
01:18:10,231 --> 01:18:11,024
Wow.

1182
01:18:12,515 --> 01:18:14,531
You know, you shouldn't
have done that.

1183
01:18:17,981 --> 01:18:19,461
He disrespected you.

1184
01:18:19,748 --> 01:18:22,938
That's a no-go for me, okay?

1185
01:18:23,742 --> 01:18:25,378
The guy was wasted!

1186
01:18:25,741 --> 01:18:29,797
Even so, you shouldn't
be treated like that. Why?

1187
01:18:29,860 --> 01:18:33,680
Have you grown numb to it?
Seriously?

1188
01:18:33,705 --> 01:18:35,664
Isn't this our line of business?

1189
01:18:38,256 --> 01:18:39,555
You're the manager,

1190
01:18:40,223 --> 01:18:43,810
customers shouldn't disrespect you.

1191
01:18:43,835 --> 01:18:48,036
I know that, but you're a stubborn
little baby, huh?

1192
01:18:48,494 --> 01:18:50,875
What's your problem?

1193
01:18:51,472 --> 01:18:54,446
Why is it my fault that
he approached me?

1194
01:18:57,563 --> 01:18:58,677
Damn it.

1195
01:18:59,225 --> 01:19:00,076
Wait a sec...

1196
01:19:00,101 --> 01:19:00,560
Why...

1197
01:19:00,560 --> 01:19:03,813
do you like being objectified?

1198
01:19:03,813 --> 01:19:05,648
Random men touching you...

1199
01:19:05,673 --> 01:19:07,289
Do you think I want this?

1200
01:19:08,695 --> 01:19:10,578
Do you think I enjoy this?

1201
01:19:11,266 --> 01:19:12,297
This?

1202
01:19:13,893 --> 01:19:17,891
All these comforts
I provided for you?

1203
01:19:19,662 --> 01:19:21,191
Have you forgotten?

1204
01:19:21,879 --> 01:19:26,310
I took you in, chewed up
my dignity for you,

1205
01:19:26,811 --> 01:19:28,104
and this is how you repay me?

1206
01:19:28,129 --> 01:19:30,715
Isn't this how all of you see me anyway?

1207
01:19:33,875 --> 01:19:34,902
Ana!

1208
01:19:34,927 --> 01:19:35,987
I'm so sorry!

1209
01:19:36,012 --> 01:19:37,207
Sorry, sorry!

1210
01:19:38,780 --> 01:19:39,839
My bad, Ana!

1211
01:19:39,864 --> 01:19:40,989
I didn't mean it.

1212
01:19:41,309 --> 01:19:43,043
It was an accident.

1213
01:19:43,472 --> 01:19:45,038
I didn't want to hurt you.

1214
01:19:45,063 --> 01:19:46,293
No, no.

1215
01:19:46,318 --> 01:19:47,653
I didn't mean it.

1216
01:19:49,959 --> 01:19:51,669
It won't happen again.

1217
01:19:51,694 --> 01:19:52,840
It won't happen again.

1218
01:19:53,492 --> 01:19:54,948
I can't take this anymore!

1219
01:19:57,950 --> 01:19:59,452
Why don't you get it?

1220
01:20:00,370 --> 01:20:02,387
Why won't you understand?

1221
01:20:06,959 --> 01:20:09,212
You prefer being
treated like trash?

1222
01:20:10,296 --> 01:20:11,496
Is that it?

1223
01:20:12,757 --> 01:20:14,457
Being degraded!

1224
01:20:15,593 --> 01:20:16,918
You enjoy it!

1225
01:20:20,285 --> 01:20:21,395
Enough!

1226
01:20:22,605 --> 01:20:23,671
That's it!

1227
01:20:28,439 --> 01:20:29,481
Stop!

1228
01:20:29,690 --> 01:20:31,036
Stop it!

1229
01:20:34,288 --> 01:20:36,082
Your lucky charm is quite chatty, huh?

1230
01:20:36,107 --> 01:20:37,098
Just look at that!

1231
01:20:39,715 --> 01:20:41,225
A whispering lucky charm, really?

1232
01:20:41,911 --> 01:20:42,918
Give it a blow.

1233
01:20:43,204 --> 01:20:44,996
Damn, he even knows how to blow.

1234
01:20:45,123 --> 01:20:46,332
That's set then.

1235
01:20:46,357 --> 01:20:47,567
What a lucky charm, where did
you even get that?

1236
01:20:47,959 --> 01:20:49,585
I'll get back with this deck.

1237
01:20:50,461 --> 01:20:51,212
We'll see.

1238
01:20:51,629 --> 01:20:52,171
Oh?

1239
01:20:52,797 --> 01:20:54,006
You won't win this time.

1240
01:20:54,173 --> 01:20:55,466
You two sure are confident.

1241
01:20:58,010 --> 01:20:58,845
- Here it comes!
- Here it comes!

1242
01:20:58,870 --> 01:21:00,111
- One more!
- Just one more!

1243
01:21:00,513 --> 01:21:01,435
There!

1244
01:21:02,666 --> 01:21:03,918
Royal!

1245
01:21:04,645 --> 01:21:05,926
Ooh, a pair!

1246
01:21:06,352 --> 01:21:07,228
Royal flush!

1247
01:21:07,829 --> 01:21:08,538
Tough luck.

1248
01:21:08,563 --> 01:21:09,188
Pair!

1249
01:21:09,213 --> 01:21:10,047
Nice hand...

1250
01:21:10,314 --> 01:21:11,149
Pay up.

1251
01:21:11,626 --> 01:21:14,145
Shuffle it in front of them,
or they'll accuse us of cheating.

1252
01:21:14,293 --> 01:21:15,920
Pay first, then we shuffle.

1253
01:21:15,945 --> 01:21:17,281
You're trying to con us.

1254
01:21:17,321 --> 01:21:18,427
Shuffle it.

1255
01:21:18,452 --> 01:21:19,646
Massage my back.

1256
01:21:20,324 --> 01:21:21,325
I'm going all in.

1257
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:26,115
Alright.

1258
01:21:33,079 --> 01:21:35,123
Slow down a bit.

1259
01:21:35,857 --> 01:21:36,816
I expect a tip from that.

1260
01:21:36,841 --> 01:21:38,092
Let's go while luck's on my side.

1261
01:21:39,302 --> 01:21:40,553
I'll bounce back.

1262
01:21:53,018 --> 01:21:54,412
Bro, what's the problem?

1263
01:21:54,437 --> 01:21:55,654
No, just a sec.

1264
01:22:02,498 --> 01:22:03,576
But there's just one.

1265
01:22:07,580 --> 01:22:08,456
He's drinking.

1266
01:22:08,481 --> 01:22:09,524
Damn it...

1267
01:22:10,708 --> 01:22:11,776
Shit!

1268
01:22:13,895 --> 01:22:16,214
- Hey, what happened to him?
- Where's he going?

1269
01:22:16,459 --> 01:22:17,598
Ask him.

1270
01:22:20,840 --> 01:22:22,299
Okay.

1271
01:22:30,353 --> 01:22:31,435
It's done for.

1272
01:22:42,544 --> 01:22:44,552
Just remember,
I get ten percent.

1273
01:22:44,577 --> 01:22:45,615
What?

1274
01:22:46,293 --> 01:22:47,401
Hold on, hold on!

1275
01:22:48,364 --> 01:22:49,397
Ben!

1276
01:22:50,631 --> 01:22:53,146
Hey, how are you?
Why are you here?

1277
01:22:56,075 --> 01:22:57,246
Nancy?

1278
01:23:00,506 --> 01:23:01,897
She's long gone,

1279
01:23:02,043 --> 01:23:03,099
almost a year.

1280
01:23:04,838 --> 01:23:06,607
Have you heard from Mando?

1281
01:23:07,491 --> 01:23:10,873
Ever since your squabble, he left.

1282
01:23:13,771 --> 01:23:15,314
Do you know where they moved?

1283
01:23:15,794 --> 01:23:17,292
Sorry, dude, I don't.

1284
01:23:17,402 --> 01:23:18,567
Wait a sec.

1285
01:23:18,903 --> 01:23:19,917
Hello!

1286
01:23:20,444 --> 01:23:21,066
Yes, bro.

1287
01:23:21,091 --> 01:23:22,755
Just remember,
ten percent for me.

1288
01:23:23,271 --> 01:23:24,198
Yes.

1289
01:23:25,899 --> 01:23:28,177
You bastard,
you screwed me over!

1290
01:23:28,202 --> 01:23:30,185
Babe, babe, hold on!

1291
01:23:32,957 --> 01:23:33,974
Honey!

1292
01:23:36,127 --> 01:23:40,185
You know, man,
if I knew a way to make quick money...

1293
01:23:40,210 --> 01:23:44,162
There's a trend now,
they buy sex videos, if you have any.

1294
01:23:44,187 --> 01:23:44,980
Love!

1295
01:23:46,100 --> 01:23:49,301
Trust me,
I got this for both of us.

1296
01:23:50,083 --> 01:23:52,700
Here, fifteen grand
just so you could bounce back.

1297
01:23:54,554 --> 01:23:57,834
- Sure, boss.
- Just make sure you'll pay.

1298
01:23:58,399 --> 01:23:59,650
Here! This one'll play.

1299
01:23:59,675 --> 01:24:01,344
Ben, how could you do that?

1300
01:24:01,459 --> 01:24:02,111
Ben?

1301
01:24:02,136 --> 01:24:03,841
Talk to me!

1302
01:24:07,617 --> 01:24:08,552
Damn it!

1303
01:24:11,175 --> 01:24:12,185
Shit!

1304
01:24:24,216 --> 01:24:26,218
Come on, we're late,
let's get in!

1305
01:24:26,927 --> 01:24:28,084
Hurry up!

1306
01:24:28,538 --> 01:24:29,779
Alright then, come on.

1307
01:24:30,890 --> 01:24:31,927
Sir, let's go!

1308
01:24:35,024 --> 01:24:36,615
Just go straight,
let's follow them.

1309
01:25:08,098 --> 01:25:09,200
Dude, thanks.

1310
01:25:09,719 --> 01:25:10,739
Let's go.

1311
01:25:12,921 --> 01:25:14,318
Wait, by the way.

1312
01:25:16,310 --> 01:25:17,459
Is he there?

1313
01:25:18,396 --> 01:25:20,560
We're going in. Thanks!

1314
01:26:06,193 --> 01:26:07,240
Damn you!

1315
01:26:12,783 --> 01:26:13,951
You bastard!

1316
01:26:24,086 --> 01:26:25,125
Jerk!

1317
01:26:26,714 --> 01:26:27,969
You asshole!

1318
01:26:28,974 --> 01:26:30,234
Son of a bitch!

1319
01:26:33,015 --> 01:26:34,091
Stop it!

1320
01:26:35,394 --> 01:26:36,883
Enough, Ben!

1321
01:26:41,156 --> 01:26:42,250
Damn it,

1322
01:26:42,649 --> 01:26:43,658
Mando!

1323
01:26:43,817 --> 01:26:45,406
We're friends, aren't we?

1324
01:26:46,051 --> 01:26:47,594
What the hell are you doing?

1325
01:26:48,169 --> 01:26:49,867
If not for me,

1326
01:26:50,118 --> 01:26:51,836
you'd be nowhere!

1327
01:26:53,062 --> 01:26:55,594
Damn you, Mando!

1328
01:26:55,993 --> 01:26:57,375
Screw you!

1329
01:26:58,589 --> 01:26:59,741
Shit!

1330
01:27:11,365 --> 01:27:12,841
Don't you have anything to say?

1331
01:27:13,553 --> 01:27:14,845
You're not even going to
make it up to me?

1332
01:27:14,870 --> 01:27:15,955
You're not going to help?

1333
01:27:15,980 --> 01:27:17,014
Mando!

1334
01:27:53,467 --> 01:27:54,748
- Ben!
- Ana!

1335
01:27:56,647 --> 01:27:58,294
Ben, why are you here?

1336
01:27:58,894 --> 01:28:00,106
Why not?

1337
01:28:01,189 --> 01:28:03,584
Are you with Sarge now? Huh?

1338
01:28:04,154 --> 01:28:05,388
- Ben!
- Are you two together?

1339
01:28:06,196 --> 01:28:09,084
Please, just leave!

1340
01:28:10,113 --> 01:28:12,153
Sarge can't see you here!

1341
01:28:12,241 --> 01:28:13,826
So, my suspicions were right?

1342
01:28:14,154 --> 01:28:15,217
You and Sarge.

1343
01:28:18,931 --> 01:28:20,560
Get out of here!

1344
01:28:21,684 --> 01:28:23,334
Leave me alone.

1345
01:28:35,697 --> 01:28:37,224
Uh, it's...

1346
01:28:39,133 --> 01:28:40,217
you're here.

1347
01:28:41,129 --> 01:28:42,927
Been a while, hasn't it?

1348
01:28:46,687 --> 01:28:47,521
What do you need?

1349
01:28:49,415 --> 01:28:51,750
Never mind.
I was leaving anyway.

1350
01:28:51,775 --> 01:28:52,834
Ben.

1351
01:28:54,242 --> 01:28:58,389
Maybe have a drink?
Karaoke?

1352
01:28:58,951 --> 01:29:00,114
My treat.

1353
01:29:00,145 --> 01:29:02,128
No, I should be going.

1354
01:29:02,153 --> 01:29:03,154
Alright then.

1355
01:29:07,207 --> 01:29:08,303
Take care, Ben.

1356
01:29:12,420 --> 01:29:15,232
Why's that asshole
ex of yours here? Huh?

1357
01:29:15,257 --> 01:29:16,635
I have no idea!

1358
01:29:16,660 --> 01:29:19,826
Oh, so you don't know?
I bet you called him over.

1359
01:29:19,851 --> 01:29:21,952
Does it look like I have "idiot"
written on my forehead?

1360
01:29:21,977 --> 01:29:23,098
Hey, I'm talking to you!

1361
01:29:23,123 --> 01:29:25,389
You have no shame,
in front of all these people!

1362
01:29:26,169 --> 01:29:28,913
Let's talk at home.

1363
01:29:28,938 --> 01:29:31,899
Alright, alright, alright.
Let's go home. You--

1364
01:31:07,051 --> 01:31:09,638
I can't talk to you anymore,
that's your problem.

1365
01:31:11,036 --> 01:31:12,934
I was just asking a question?

1366
01:31:13,203 --> 01:31:15,201
- Huh?
- What's your problem, huh?

1367
01:31:15,853 --> 01:31:16,854
Why can't you give me
a straight answer?

1368
01:31:16,879 --> 01:31:18,326
You never understand!

1369
01:31:19,091 --> 01:31:20,475
I'm just asking!

1370
01:31:20,758 --> 01:31:22,593
Why are you mad?

1371
01:31:23,068 --> 01:31:24,945
Because you're not even listening!

1372
01:31:24,970 --> 01:31:26,263
Then what's that jerk doing there?

1373
01:31:26,263 --> 01:31:26,722
Enough!

1374
01:31:26,722 --> 01:31:27,765
It's the same shit,
over and over!

1375
01:31:27,765 --> 01:31:29,141
No, just answer me.

1376
01:31:29,166 --> 01:31:31,418
- What's that asshole doing there?
- Stop it, enough!

1377
01:31:31,443 --> 01:31:32,544
Seriously?

1378
01:31:32,569 --> 01:31:33,837
You called him, right?

1379
01:31:33,862 --> 01:31:34,580
What?

1380
01:31:34,605 --> 01:31:35,355
- Huh?
- I didn't call him.

1381
01:31:35,355 --> 01:31:36,523
- I don't know anything about it!
- You called him!

1382
01:31:36,548 --> 01:31:38,310
Oh, so you miss him now?

1383
01:31:38,650 --> 01:31:40,201
- Did you, did you call him?
- Enough already!

1384
01:31:40,884 --> 01:31:42,466
Did you, did you call him?

1385
01:31:48,631 --> 01:31:49,692
Ana!

1386
01:31:49,998 --> 01:31:54,369
Never turn your back on me
when I'm talking to you!

1387
01:31:54,394 --> 01:31:56,225
- What's your problem?
- Don't even—

1388
01:31:57,404 --> 01:31:59,354
- Are you for real?
- Look, I'm right here, okay?

1389
01:31:59,380 --> 01:32:00,714
You're getting really brave now!

1390
01:32:00,739 --> 01:32:02,029
You're something else.

1391
01:32:02,257 --> 01:32:03,428
What? Huh?

1392
01:32:03,918 --> 01:32:05,269
What? Who do you
think you are?

1393
01:32:05,302 --> 01:32:06,236
Wanna take me on?

1394
01:32:06,261 --> 01:32:07,654
You think you can take me?

1395
01:32:07,679 --> 01:32:08,822
Enough!

1396
01:32:08,847 --> 01:32:10,866
- I really don't know anything about it!
- You think you can play me?

1397
01:32:10,891 --> 01:32:13,475
I really don't know
anything about it!

1398
01:32:14,078 --> 01:32:16,080
You want to go
back to your asshole ex?

1399
01:32:16,105 --> 01:32:18,154
Is that so? Huh?
What?

1400
01:32:18,186 --> 01:32:19,792
Does he hit you like this?

1401
01:32:19,817 --> 01:32:21,943
I saved you from
your miserable life.

1402
01:32:23,028 --> 01:32:24,129
Bitch!

1403
01:32:24,154 --> 01:32:25,506
- I took you in.
- Stop it!

1404
01:32:25,531 --> 01:32:27,382
I gave you everything.

1405
01:32:27,407 --> 01:32:28,889
Everything you have!

1406
01:32:28,926 --> 01:32:30,010
Please stop.

1407
01:32:30,035 --> 01:32:32,913
You owe me your life!

1408
01:32:37,644 --> 01:32:38,740
Enough!

1409
01:32:39,920 --> 01:32:41,342
What, do you want it harder?

1410
01:33:26,287 --> 01:33:28,174
Here, here.

1411
01:36:49,356 --> 01:36:50,356
Ben.

1412
01:36:51,254 --> 01:36:52,254
Ben.

1413
01:37:14,945 --> 01:37:16,021
Hurry, hurry.

1414
01:37:16,918 --> 01:37:18,148
Let's get out of here.

1415
01:37:18,247 --> 01:37:19,550
Come with me.

1416
01:37:19,575 --> 01:37:22,926
Let's get away and
start a new life.

1417
01:37:23,464 --> 01:37:24,464
Let's go!

1418
01:37:26,160 --> 01:37:27,206
Charlie!

1419
01:37:27,511 --> 01:37:28,666
Charlie!

1420
01:37:29,332 --> 01:37:30,418
Come here!

1421
01:37:30,567 --> 01:37:31,855
Go to my office,

1422
01:37:32,108 --> 01:37:34,439
there are three folders
on my desk...

1423
01:37:34,464 --> 01:37:36,108
in the drawer, three of them.

1424
01:37:36,133 --> 01:37:38,468
They're labeled Dela Peña,
Go, and Cruz.

1425
01:37:38,777 --> 01:37:40,070
Bring me Cruz's.

1426
01:37:40,095 --> 01:37:41,980
Okay, hurry up.
Hurry up!

1427
01:37:43,168 --> 01:37:44,753
I have a meeting, Charlie!

1428
01:37:45,259 --> 01:37:46,589
Run, Charlie!

1429
01:37:47,633 --> 01:37:48,714
Hello!

1430
01:37:48,994 --> 01:37:50,027
Yeah, man.

1431
01:37:50,626 --> 01:37:51,691
Just fool around with them.

1432
01:37:52,730 --> 01:37:53,884
Yeah, yeah.

1433
01:37:54,753 --> 01:37:56,115
No problem,

1434
01:37:56,317 --> 01:37:57,746
I'm on my way.

1435
01:37:58,542 --> 01:37:59,574
Alright.

1436
01:37:59,612 --> 01:38:00,754
Charlie, what's taking so long?

1437
01:38:00,941 --> 01:38:01,967
Boss?

1438
01:38:01,992 --> 01:38:03,699
I really can't find it!

1439
01:38:04,223 --> 01:38:05,683
Are you blind?

1440
01:38:06,580 --> 01:38:08,028
I'm gonna be late!

1441
01:38:09,259 --> 01:38:11,800
Can't trust you with
anything simple, man!

1442
01:38:17,427 --> 01:38:19,529
Ben, you need to leave.

1443
01:38:19,554 --> 01:38:21,269
No, I'm not leaving.
Come with me.

1444
01:38:21,294 --> 01:38:22,546
Come with me.

1445
01:38:22,571 --> 01:38:24,074
No, just leave me, Ben.

1446
01:38:24,191 --> 01:38:26,582
Please, come with me.

1447
01:38:27,652 --> 01:38:29,018
Ben, he'll kill you!

1448
01:38:29,519 --> 01:38:31,169
No, he won't kill me.

1449
01:38:32,289 --> 01:38:33,540
- Ben!
- He won't kill me.

1450
01:38:33,565 --> 01:38:35,025
I got this,
I got this, let's go!

1451
01:38:35,050 --> 01:38:37,222
Let's go!
Come on, come on!

1452
01:39:10,143 --> 01:39:11,143
Come on!

1453
01:39:13,063 --> 01:39:14,063
Hey!

1454

Here, here.

01:39:19,653 --> 01:39:20,653
Hide, hide.

1456
01:39:27,869 --> 01:39:28,869
Ma'am,

1457
01:39:29,136 --> 01:39:30,253

1458
01:39:33,346 --> 01:39:34,346
Ma'am!

Hurry, hurry!

01:39:58,631 --> 01:40:00,746
Ana, you bitch!

01:40:54,596 --> 01:40:55,933
Here! Here!

1467
01:41:08,198 --> 01:41:09,604
Babe, hurry.

1468
01:41:35,285 --> 01:41:37,261
I got you!

1469
01:41:57,706 --> 01:41:58,865
Damn you!

1470
01:41:59,901 --> 01:42:01,105
Ben!

1471
01:42:01,257 --> 01:42:02,713
Screw you!

Ana Fuentes!

1475
01:42:09,692 --> 01:42:11,808
You bitch!

1476
01:42:16,871 --> 01:42:19,140
I'm gonna kill the both of you.

1477
01:42:19,165 --> 01:42:20,667
You and your asshole ex.

1478
01:42:20,692 --> 01:42:23,011
You sons of bitches.
Get over here!

1479
01:42:23,470 --> 01:42:26,612
You thought you're gonna escape?
Damn you!

No, Ben.

1486
01:43:33,571 --> 01:43:35,054
Go on, go on. Leave.

1487
01:43:35,106 --> 01:43:36,182
Leave.

1488
01:43:37,035 --> 01:43:38,538
I don't want to, Ben!

1489
01:43:40,780 --> 01:43:42,060
Babe, run!

1490
01:43:42,577 --> 01:43:44,365
