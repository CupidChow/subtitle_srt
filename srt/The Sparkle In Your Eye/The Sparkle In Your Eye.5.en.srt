"The Sparkle In Your Eye"

00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
(Episode 5)

3
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:03,440
Peijia Peijia Peijia Peijia.

4
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:10,080
Hello everyone.

5
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:11,600
Be careful everyone.

6
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,360
No pushing.

7
00:01:12,361 --> 00:01:13,600
There's enough for everybody.

8
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,256
Skipping all those business invitations.

9
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,760
Just to pick a ribbon-cutting gig.

10
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:24,000
Ahhh.

11
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,280
Alright.

12
00:02:52,281 --> 00:02:54,240
If everything's settled
I'll book the studio.

13
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,360
Teacher Pei

14
00:02:56,361 --> 00:02:58,480
I'll schedule your recording
studio session next.

15
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,280
What about the others?

16
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,320
Recording together.

17
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,320
Others are scheduled
two weeks later like you.

18
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:06,720
That long.

19
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,480
Yeah, the studio's fully booked these days.

20
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,679
Hey, what if we....

21
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,680
Hmm.

22
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,319
We haven't gathered in ages.

23
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:19,119
Let me organize a wrap party reunion.

24
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,280
Since everyone's free lately.

25
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,480
I was just going to mention.

26
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,280
Su Bai just called me.

27
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,120
Asking to meet for dinner next Friday.

28
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,840
Perfect timing.

29
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:29,840
He misses you.

30
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:33,920
Maybe.

31
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,720
This is a reconciliation attempt.

32
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,880
But he's scared to admit it.

33
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,200
When was this taken.

34
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,280
Nine years ago.

35
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,280
When we first met.

36
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,160
Our first photo together.

37
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,840
To be honest.

38
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,360
During our honeymoon phase.

39
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,799
I'd never met anyone like him.

40
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,840
A blazing fire.

41
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,040
Who wouldn't listen to reason.

42
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:06,880
I used to be timid.

43
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,440
But after meeting him.

44
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,800
I became fearless.

45
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,200
Hmm.

46
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,919
Brother Jia, it's just a wrap party.

47
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:48,040
Not an award ceremony, why so serious.

48
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,199
This is way too formal.

49
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,200
Nope.

50
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,120
Still not right.

51
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:25,840
Dishes are ordered.

52
00:05:25,841 --> 00:05:27,040
Just waiting on you.

53
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,919
Looking sharp today.

54
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:30,560
Bro.

55
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,320
Hey.

56
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,320
Where are the other two.

57
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,320
No idea.

58
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,320
And the rest?

59
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,679
Others.

60
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,480
Haven't seen them.

61
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,480
Probably running late.

62
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,039
But they're never late usually.

63
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,160
True.

64
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:43,960
Let me call.

65
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:46,920
Hello?

66
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,600
Where are you?

67
00:05:50,904 --> 00:05:52,000
Long time no see.

68
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,720
You came.

69
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:02,720
Yeah

70
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,720
I was afraid you'd bail.

71
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Have a seat, man.

72
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,760
Isn't this the wrap party.

73
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:08,960
Where's everyone else.

74
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,319
Oh.

75
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,080
Hello.

76
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:12,600
Oh.

77
00:06:12,601 --> 00:06:13,840
You can't make it today.

78
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,240
Got it.

79
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,880
How about the others?

80
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,920
Traffic jam, huh.

81
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,080
Alright then.

82
00:06:21,081 --> 00:06:22,240
We'll reschedule.

83
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,960
So unreliable.

84
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,640
Nobody's coming.

85
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,720
Just us then.

86
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,480
Dig in.

87
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,880
How've you been?

88
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,080
How's your show going?

89
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:37,760
It's yours too.

90
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,480
Not anymore.

91
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,000
What about that project?

92
00:06:41,001 --> 00:06:42,159
I'm out of it.

93
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,280
Remove my credits.

94
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,080
Why?

95
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,760
It's no longer my work.

96
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,440
That show and I are done.

97
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,200
Yi Wei.

98
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,160
I need to say this formally.

99
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,160
Let's break up.

100
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,400
We can stay friends.

101
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,080
Hmph.

102
00:07:10,081 --> 00:07:11,480
Acting childish again.

103
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:16,800
I'm serious.

104
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,440
I'm leaving you.

105
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,599
Today is not.

106
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,599
The right occasion for your breakup talk.

107
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:26,039
Today is our wrap party after years apart.

108
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,520
Come on, let's make a toast.

109
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,720
To the toast! To the toast.

110
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,760
Eat up.

111
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,400
It's all in the drink.

112
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,920
I've seen your promotional materials.

113
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,400
The posters aren't as
handsome as you in real life.

114
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,160
What do you think, Little Su?

115
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,560
Little Su?

116
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:09,880
What kind of name is that?

117
00:09:09,881 --> 00:09:11,000
It's so tacky.

118
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,360
Hey, never mind that.

119
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,160
Let's play that game.

120
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:18,920
What game?

121
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,680
The one you taught me.

122
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,600
Twenty Questions.

123
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,160
No, that needs two
people asking each other.

124
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,039
And it's for strangers.

125
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,480
Come on, let's try.

126
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,560
First question.

127
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,280
Great Director.

128
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,200
If.

129
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,320
You could become famous in one way.

130
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,440
How would you do it?

131
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,640
Hello, I want to be famous.

132
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,520
The way I want to be famous is.

133
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,040
By directing Su Bai's works.

134
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,400
That's how.

135
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,600
Su Bai.

136
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,120
You're the best.

137
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,120
Screenwriter.

138
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,240
Screenwriter.

139
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:01,680
And lover.

140
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,240
Alright.

141
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Your turn.

142
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,920
Next question.

143
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:18,840
Teacher Su.

144
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,840
Me.

145
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,480
Ask.

146
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:26,080
If you were going to die tonight.

147
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,640
What would you say to him?

148
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,119
That's not part of the game.

149
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,520
Hypothetically.

150
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,079
Now it is.

151
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,080
Hurry up.

152
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:37,680
Come on.

153
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:49,960
I

154
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,240
I loved you.

155
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,760
Even though.

156
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,920
I decided to leave.

157
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,400
My feelings were genuine.

158
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,240
Look.

159
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,040
The mood is set.

160
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,800
We've had this heartfelt confession.

161
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,680
Shouldn't we.

162
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:18,600
What?

163
00:11:18,601 --> 00:11:20,720
Sit closer.

164
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,120
Time to kiss.

165
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,160
Who'd kiss him.

166
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,800
Right.

167
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,280
Let's treat it as.

168
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,840
Our last kiss.

169
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,160
Oh my.

170
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,320
Why the long face.

171
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:16,840
Do you hate me that much?

172
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:22,960
Here.

173
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,600
Smile.

174
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,680
Not cute.

175
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:34,840
Do you think

176
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,520
they're still kissing?

177
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,479
They're at their farewell moment.

178
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,760
Of course they're still kissing.

179
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:46,760
But they look.

180
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,080
So in love.

181
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,000
Hey, did you see earlier.

182
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,640
Your brother's lips were nearly kissed raw.

183
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:58,039
No wonder Teacher Su's scripts
have so many kissing scenes.

184
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,800
Art imitates life.

185
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,200
Exactly.

186
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:06,000
If you've never experienced that feeling.

187
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,120
You can't possibly imagine it.

188
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,720
You know.

189
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,360
When filming kissing scenes before.

190
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:21,239
I used to secretly hug a plaster statue.

191
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,320
And kiss it in the hallway.

192
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,520
I remember.

193
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:28,000
It looked so ridiculous when I saw you.

194
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,400
What kind of fool was that.

195
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,519
When you caught me

196
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,560
I wished I were that plaster model.

197
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,440
It was kinda cute.

198
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:37,800
Though.

199
00:14:37,801 --> 00:14:39,960
Kissing plaster must've tasted awful.

200
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,000
I used to imagine.

201
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,279
If someone asked me.

202
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:45,760
Hey.

203
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,280
Who was your first kiss.

204
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:50,280
I pointed at the plaster
model and said that one.

205
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,600
Hey.

206
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:37,920
Ah, Director Yi.

207
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,400
Your call couldn't have
come at a better time.

208
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,440
Yes, we're right downstairs.

209
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,760
Mhm, coming right up.

210
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,040
Let's go.

211
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,320
They're looking for us.

212
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,520
Okay.

213
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:53,760
Let's head back.

214
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:57,920
So basically.

215
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:01,480
Practicing kiss scenes should
be done with real people.

216
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:03,840
The feeling's different.

217
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:08,800
Right.

218
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,040
Modern dramas have lots of kissing scenes.

219
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,040
We should practice more.

220
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,320
For work.

221
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,360
For work.

222
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,920
Wasn't this scene supposed to be cut.

223
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,040
I didn't get around to it.

224
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,639
You knew this scene was getting cut.

225
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:30,080
You're not interested
in that Su Yi, are you.

226
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,480
Don't be ridiculous.

227
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:32,880
Would I ever look at him.

228
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,040
I'm Pei Jia.

229
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,520
What kind of person.

230
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:37,640
Am I.

231
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:41,960
Had enough fun.

232
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,160
What exactly are you trying to do?

233
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:51,359
You want to tell me you were my first kiss.

234
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,599
Is messing with me fun.

235
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,840
Do you enjoy this feeling?

236
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,600
You were like this during filming.

237
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:00,120
The show's over but
you're still toying with me.

238
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,200
Does bullying me make you feel...

239
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,680
accomplished.

240
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:07,800
Does bullying me make you feel superior?

241
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,399
You're Yi Ke Xiao Xiao Su.

242
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,400
Right?

243
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:25,560
I don't know

244
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:26,720
I know.

245
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:29,400
You even wrote me letters.

246
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:31,840
Su Yi.

247
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:35,360
I received that letter at my lowest point.

248
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,479
That letter.

249
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,320
Gave me the courage to start over.

250
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,439
I've always wanted to thank you.

251
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,600
Don't thank me.

252
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,480
You think your gratitude.

253
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,360
Means I should be eternally grateful.

254
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:57,400
That's not what I meant.

255
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,200
If you really want to thank me.

256
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:03,880
Keep your distance.

257
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,400
Don't let me have
any more fantasies or misunderstandings.

258
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,400
What's wrong?

259
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:04,080
Nothing, bro.

260
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,280
Your lips are all red.

261
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:16,920
Is this that.

262
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,520
Feeling of finality.

263
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,160
Come on, keep drinking.

264
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,520
The director said...

265
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,400
bring out all the
selfishness you've ever had

266
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,200
and give him a deep kiss.

267
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:50,880
The last one
