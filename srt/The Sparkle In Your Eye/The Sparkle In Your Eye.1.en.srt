1
00:00:03,533 --> 00:00:07,000
Do you know what it's like
when the world turns dark?

2
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:10,200
In complete darkness.

3
00:00:11,233 --> 00:00:12,633
Your hearing becomes acute

4
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:16,900
3

5
00:00:16,966 --> 00:00:19,666
- 2 1 Action.
- Every noise around you gets amplified infinitely.

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,100
This might be my future.

7
00:00:26,166 --> 00:00:28,066
This could be my last time acting.

8
00:00:30,533 --> 00:00:31,833
And also my first time.

9
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,433
Scene 4, Take 3.

10
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:37,900
"The Sparkle In Your Eye"

11
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
(Episode 1)

12
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,200
Everyone, please silence your phones.

13
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:48,766
Phones on silent now.

14
00:01:49,666 --> 00:01:50,666
Alright, let's continue.

15
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,432
Full set quiet

16
00:01:52,433 --> 00:01:52,900
3

17
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:53,600
2

18
00:01:53,666 --> 00:01:54,466
1

19
00:01:54,466 --> 00:01:55,466
Action!

20
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:58,933
I just want to keep
you for this last second.

21
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,766
Even though I know
it's just the final moment.

22
00:02:05,533 --> 00:02:06,533
Cut!

23
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,133
What's wrong?

24
00:02:11,133 --> 00:02:11,933
Sorry Director.

25
00:02:11,934 --> 00:02:13,433
My eyes felt uncomfortable.

26
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,800
Eye discomfort?

27
00:02:15,033 --> 00:02:16,700
Just a bit dry, no big deal.

28
00:02:18,233 --> 00:02:19,233
I see, Xiao Su.

29
00:02:19,433 --> 00:02:21,232
Even though Pei Jia
isn't here to act with you.

30
00:02:21,233 --> 00:02:22,665
But your gaze shouldn't wander.

31
00:02:22,666 --> 00:02:25,166
Just imagine he's right here...

32
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:30,533
Never mind.

33
00:02:30,533 --> 00:02:30,833
Xiao Liu.

34
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:31,366
Yes?

35
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,400
When will Pei Jia arrive?

36
00:02:32,666 --> 00:02:34,166
His assistant said 30 more minutes.

37
00:02:34,433 --> 00:02:35,300
You act with Xiao Su.

38
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:36,300
Of course.

39
00:02:36,666 --> 00:02:37,033
No problem.

40
00:02:37,033 --> 00:02:37,700
Let's do another take.

41
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:38,133
Ah.

42
00:02:38,233 --> 00:02:39,233
Okay.

43
00:02:39,366 --> 00:02:40,676
- All departments ready.
- Great work everyone.

44
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:41,700
Good work.

45
00:02:44,533 --> 00:02:45,466
A...

46
00:02:45,466 --> 00:02:46,466
Action!

47
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,500
Eh.

48
00:02:51,566 --> 00:02:52,566
Get me bubble tea.

49
00:02:52,633 --> 00:02:53,900
Large with tapioca and pudding.

50
00:02:54,433 --> 00:02:55,233
Jia-ge.

51
00:02:55,234 --> 00:02:57,033
We're already a day late.

52
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,760
Then a little longer won't matter.

53
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:00,532
They begged me to save this project

54
00:03:00,533 --> 00:03:01,533
1/3rd sugar.

55
00:03:04,066 --> 00:03:04,566
Hey.

56
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,933
Order 30 more cups.

57
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,400
Sure Jia-ge.

58
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,200
What's wrong? Jia-ge.

59
00:03:13,266 --> 00:03:14,266
Nothing.

60
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:17,700
By the way Jia-ge

61
00:03:17,866 --> 00:03:19,966
Mr. Fang asked me to
give you the crew contract.

62
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,265
Said it's a company-funded production.

63
00:03:22,266 --> 00:03:23,366
Signed it for you directly.

64
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,233
But he wants you to review it.

65
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,533
Said we can modify anything unsatisfactory.

66
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:28,766
This project

67
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,360
I can't even bother reading the script.

68
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,066
Okay.

69
00:03:39,066 --> 00:03:40,066
Cut!

70
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:42,566
Alright everyone, wrap for today.

71
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Thank you Director.

72
00:03:46,333 --> 00:03:47,333
Here.

73
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,500
Tired?

74
00:03:48,833 --> 00:03:49,333
Not too bad.

75
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:49,933
Xiao Liu.

76
00:03:49,933 --> 00:03:50,800
Yes?

77
00:03:50,801 --> 00:03:51,932
Call Pei Jia's assistant.

78
00:03:51,933 --> 00:03:52,933
Tell them we wrapped today.

79
00:03:52,934 --> 00:03:54,165
Meet him at the hotel tonight.

80
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:55,166
Okay.

81
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,809
I told you we should've
cast a non-professional.

82
00:03:57,833 --> 00:03:59,100
It's only the first day.

83
00:03:59,133 --> 00:04:00,133
And he's already absent.

84
00:04:00,733 --> 00:04:01,733
What can we do?

85
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,300
Investor's demand.

86
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,866
It's our first film after all.

87
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:06,666
Alright

88
00:04:06,667 --> 00:04:08,366
I know you put your heart into this.

89
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,966
But don't overwork yourself.

90
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:12,133
Oh right.

91
00:04:12,233 --> 00:04:13,466
Work overtime tonight.

92
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:15,200
Revise your brother's lines.

93
00:04:15,466 --> 00:04:17,100
His acting is terrible.

94
00:04:17,933 --> 00:04:18,966
Stop complaining.

95
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,200
Few actors want to do our genre.

96
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:22,966
Su Yi's joining is already a miracle.

97
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,233
Alright

98
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:27,966
I'll revise it tonight

99
00:04:28,066 --> 00:04:29,066
Mr. Pei Jia is here.

100
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:31,333
Ah.

101
00:04:31,433 --> 00:04:31,966
Mr. Pei.

102
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,233
Haha, nice to meet you.

103
00:04:55,033 --> 00:04:56,065
Thank you for your hard work, Mr. Pei.

104
00:04:56,066 --> 00:04:56,933
We didn't expect you to come so late.

105
00:04:56,934 --> 00:04:58,433
Actually...

106
00:04:58,466 --> 00:05:00,906
We didn't expect you to
come to the set personally after wrap.

107
00:05:01,133 --> 00:05:03,600
This is our screenwriter Mr. Su Bai.

108
00:05:03,833 --> 00:05:04,932
He always talks like this.

109
00:05:04,933 --> 00:05:06,566
Thinks he's being humorous.

110
00:05:07,133 --> 00:05:07,766
My apologies.

111
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:09,100
Got held up.

112
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,000
No problem.

113
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,266
Are these for us?

114
00:05:12,533 --> 00:05:13,932
Yes, bubble tea for everyone.

115
00:05:13,933 --> 00:05:14,966
Thank you.

116
00:05:19,933 --> 00:05:21,200
Here's the thing.

117
00:05:21,266 --> 00:05:24,200
We planned to meet you at
the hotel tonight to go over things.

118
00:05:24,266 --> 00:05:24,766
Since you're here.

119
00:05:24,833 --> 00:05:25,833
Let me introduce.

120
00:05:25,889 --> 00:05:26,789
This is...

121
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:27,833
We've already met.

122
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:30,200
Mr. Su.

123
00:05:30,233 --> 00:05:31,233
Pleasure.

124
00:05:32,033 --> 00:05:33,065
Mr. Pei

125
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:34,666
I'm a huge fan of your work.

126
00:05:34,733 --> 00:05:36,166
Never thought I'd act with you.

127
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:37,966
When I heard the news

128
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,666
I was over the moon.

129
00:05:47,266 --> 00:05:48,266
Do I know you?

130
00:05:50,066 --> 00:05:52,133
No, it's my honor to meet you today.

131
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:54,900
Hmph.

132
00:05:55,266 --> 00:05:56,766
What have you acted in before?

133
00:05:57,333 --> 00:05:59,233
This is my first acting role.

134
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,820
Looking forward to your guidance.

135
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,533
First time acting?

136
00:06:04,633 --> 00:06:05,133
Good.

137
00:06:05,133 --> 00:06:06,133
Blank slate.

138
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:07,933
Ask me if you need help.

139
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:09,333
Okay.

140
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:12,900
Thank you Director.

141
00:06:13,133 --> 00:06:15,166
Check immediately.

142
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,833
If there are loopholes in the contract.

143
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,600
Hurry!

144
00:06:22,133 --> 00:06:22,966
Here's the plan.

145
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,799
Rest early tonight.

146
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,199
We start at 9am tomorrow.

147
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:29,265
The producer will come to your room.

148
00:06:29,266 --> 00:06:30,266
To wake you up.

149
00:06:31,033 --> 00:06:32,033
Us?

150
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:35,132
Yes, due to the sensitive
nature of this project.

151
00:06:35,133 --> 00:06:37,732
The leads need to live together.

152
00:06:37,733 --> 00:06:38,733
To build chemistry.

153
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:40,966
What?

154
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,600
I can't sleep with others in the room.

155
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:46,533
It's in the contract.

156
00:06:55,733 --> 00:06:57,433
Fine, I'll cooperate fully.

157
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:59,300
We'll follow the contract.

158
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,800
At least we're not sharing a bed.

159
00:07:03,233 --> 00:07:04,933
The next page of the contract says...

160
00:07:16,655 --> 00:07:19,538
"...the two actors are set to stay in
the same hotel room and share a bed."

161
00:07:24,066 --> 00:07:24,700
Understood, Director.

162
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:25,366
See you tomorrow.

163
00:07:25,466 --> 00:07:25,900
Ah.

164
00:07:25,901 --> 00:07:26,933
Rest well.

165
00:07:29,933 --> 00:07:31,400
Call Fang Runzhi now.

166
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,733
What a shitty crew.

167
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:37,000
Su Bai didn't even greet me properly.

168
00:07:37,466 --> 00:07:38,800
Does he think he's funny?

169
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:42,333
Who does he think he is?

170
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:43,700
And.

171
00:07:43,701 --> 00:07:46,099
They aired me with an amateur.

172
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,166
What am I?

173
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,800
A charity teacher?

174
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,632
Jia-ge

175
00:07:50,633 --> 00:07:51,866
Mr. Fang isn't answering.

176
00:07:55,066 --> 00:07:56,233
Tonight you.

177
00:07:56,866 --> 00:07:59,766
Stay up all night to find contract flaws.

178
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,733
We leave tomorrow morning.

179
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:02,933
Understood.

180
00:08:02,934 --> 00:08:05,033
They gave me the keycard, 6th floor.

181
00:08:08,066 --> 00:08:09,166
Are you stupid?

182
00:08:10,033 --> 00:08:11,133
Sixth floor my ass.

183
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:13,133
You expect me to share a bed?

184
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:15,333
Book another room.

185
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,932
Your keycard, sir.

186
00:08:22,933 --> 00:08:25,166
Thanks, I'll book another room later.

187
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,200
Certainly.

188
00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:39,008
Another room please.

189
00:08:39,033 --> 00:08:39,633
Three days.

190
00:08:39,634 --> 00:08:41,666
But you already have one.

191
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,665
My colleague has sleep issues

192
00:08:43,666 --> 00:08:44,786
I don't want to disturb him.

193
00:08:44,833 --> 00:08:46,332
Will you keep room V1?

194
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:48,200
Yes, someone's still staying there

195
00:08:48,233 --> 00:08:49,466
I'll take another room.

196
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:51,700
King bed room is 650 per night.

197
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:53,666
Okay.

198
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,200
(Your account ending in 1335 has insufficient
funds. Your current balance is 1561.23 yuan)

199
00:09:00,933 --> 00:09:03,600
Two nights for now, thanks.

200
00:09:04,233 --> 00:09:05,233
Certainly.

201
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
(Your credit card spent 1,300 yuan.
Please make sure to repay on time.)

202
00:10:40,266 --> 00:10:43,166
He asked if we'd met before.

203
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:47,433
Does he remember me?

204
00:11:27,933 --> 00:11:29,366
Jia-ge, I checked.

205
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:31,576
Probably that actor who
ruined the last production.

206
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,600
Made them paranoid.

207
00:11:32,933 --> 00:11:34,633
This contract is airtight.

208
00:11:35,033 --> 00:11:36,866
Unless we pay the penalty.

209
00:11:37,233 --> 00:11:38,233
Hmph.

210
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:39,666
You pay it then.

211
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,300
Not appropriate.

212
00:11:41,733 --> 00:11:42,733
Another piece of intel.

213
00:11:42,933 --> 00:11:44,132
That Su Yi.

214
00:11:44,133 --> 00:11:45,453
Is screenwriter Su Bai's brother.

215
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,633
Nepotism hire.

216
00:11:47,733 --> 00:11:49,833
Where are we sneaking off to?

217
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,633
Doesn't the contract say.

218
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,300
We have to share a room?

219
00:11:53,466 --> 00:11:55,566
Get back before the morning call.

220
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,000
Jia-ge knows best.

221
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:06,300
Good morning, Mr. Pei.

222
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Up so early.

223
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Breakfast?

224
00:12:10,133 --> 00:12:11,133
You are?

225
00:12:11,466 --> 00:12:12,400
Su Yi.

226
00:12:12,433 --> 00:12:13,433
From yesterday.

227
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:15,700
Oh.

228
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,600
Sleep well?

229
00:12:18,066 --> 00:12:19,366
Memorized lines all night.

230
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,666
I didn't want to disturb
you so I stayed away.

231
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,033
So dedicated.

232
00:12:23,633 --> 00:12:25,633
No wonder I didn't see you.

233
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:27,133
Thought you booked another room.

234
00:12:29,033 --> 00:12:30,633
What a coincidence.

235
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:32,166
Car's downstairs, let's go.

236
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,133
Coming.

237
00:12:33,133 --> 00:12:34,133
Yi Yi.

238
00:12:44,433 --> 00:12:45,433
Brother.

239
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:48,266
Hmm?

240
00:12:48,533 --> 00:12:50,633
Don't worry, I memorized everything.

241
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:52,166
Take this.

242
00:12:53,633 --> 00:12:55,932
Director thinks the
original script was too hard

243
00:12:55,933 --> 00:12:57,000
I revised it.

244
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:58,300
Study it.

245
00:13:05,148 --> 00:13:06,148
Such big changes.

246
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:08,900
No choice.

247
00:13:10,533 --> 00:13:12,200
Do your best! Don't disappoint me.

248
00:13:13,533 --> 00:13:14,833
Study it carefully.

249
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,566
Hair okay?

250
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,600
Yep.

251
00:13:23,633 --> 00:13:24,900
Alright! Full set ready.

252
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:26,980
Sir, let me put down the script.

253
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:39,099
Mr. Pei, please.

254
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:39,966
Here

255
00:13:40,033 --> 00:13:40,933
3

256
00:13:40,933 --> 00:13:41,533
2

257
00:13:41,533 --> 00:13:42,133
1

258
00:13:42,134 --> 00:13:43,233
Action.

259
00:13:44,924 --> 00:13:46,391
Stop acting childish.

260
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,465
- Why so stubborn.
- Who's really...

261
00:13:48,466 --> 00:13:49,666
Who's really the child here?

262
00:13:57,133 --> 00:13:58,133
Alright, cut.

263
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,300
Ready Mr. Pei？.

264
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:09,133
Mr. Pei, let's go.

265
00:14:09,134 --> 00:14:10,400
We'll do another take.

266
00:14:14,866 --> 00:14:15,366
Here Mr. Pei.

267
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,300
Are we set?

268
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,466
Let's go again.

269
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,033
Alright, positions

270
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,200
3

271
00:14:29,266 --> 00:14:29,900
2

272
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:30,333
1

273
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:31,333
Action!

274
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,266
Never thought people
like us could be friends.

275
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:36,500
But since we are

276
00:14:36,501 --> 00:14:37,933
I never wanted to be friends.

277
00:14:38,233 --> 00:14:39,566
Stop being childish.

278
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:40,833
Why so stubborn?

279
00:14:42,433 --> 00:14:43,766
Who's the real child here?

280
00:14:45,733 --> 00:14:46,733
Whose phone?

281
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,200
Cut!

282
00:14:50,666 --> 00:14:51,666
Who's phone?

283
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:03,800
Alright

284
00:15:04,866 --> 00:15:05,166
3

285
00:15:05,233 --> 00:15:05,666
2

286
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:06,100
1

287
00:15:06,533 --> 00:15:07,533
Action!

288
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,866
Why so childish?

289
00:15:10,133 --> 00:15:11,133
So stubborn.

290
00:15:11,433 --> 00:15:12,733
Who's really immature?

291
00:15:13,233 --> 00:15:14,700
Who's been avoiding me?

292
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:33,033
No one asked you.

293
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,466
No one came.

294
00:15:36,133 --> 00:15:37,166
No one told you.

295
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:38,700
Cut!

296
00:15:39,433 --> 00:15:40,732
I'm building the emotion!

297
00:15:40,733 --> 00:15:42,333
Need prompting?

298
00:15:42,933 --> 00:15:43,933
Sorry Mr. Pei.

299
00:15:44,633 --> 00:15:45,266
Film properly.

300
00:15:45,266 --> 00:15:46,266
Or get out.

301
00:15:47,133 --> 00:15:47,933
Another take.

302
00:15:48,066 --> 00:15:49,466
Hold on, pause.

303
00:16:10,233 --> 00:16:11,133
Mr. Pei.

304
00:16:11,134 --> 00:16:12,854
Director asked if you want to eat together.

305
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:14,100
No need.

306
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,200
Thanks.

307
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Alright.

308
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,600
Hey.

309
00:16:20,066 --> 00:16:21,133
Um.

310
00:16:21,633 --> 00:16:22,633
Earlier.

311
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:24,932
My bad.

312
00:16:24,933 --> 00:16:25,933
No problem.

313
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:26,866
In the future.

314
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:28,340
Looking forward to working together.

315
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:34,200
Sorry sorry sorry.

316
00:16:36,933 --> 00:16:38,000
You.

317
00:16:39,533 --> 00:16:40,733
Better watch yourself.

318
00:16:41,733 --> 00:16:42,833
Stay away from me.

319
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:46,933
Yi Yi.

320
00:16:47,533 --> 00:16:49,166
I need to shower.

321
00:17:02,066 --> 00:17:03,500
The great director returns.

322
00:17:11,533 --> 00:17:12,733
Look who's back.

323
00:17:18,533 --> 00:17:19,533
Must be tired.

324
00:17:20,466 --> 00:17:22,465
Pei Jia drove me crazy today.

325
00:17:22,466 --> 00:17:23,466
Ugh.

326
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:26,100
What's wrong?

327
00:17:26,533 --> 00:17:27,766
Already behind schedule.

328
00:17:27,866 --> 00:17:29,366
Tried to catch up.

329
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,400
His assistant said.

330
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,133
"Sir, our eight hours are up."

331
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,499
How considerate.

332
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,899
Skips the first day.

333
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,133
Slows us down the next.

334
00:17:38,433 --> 00:17:41,933
In the future, who knows
what hell he will pull next.

335
00:17:42,425 --> 00:17:43,758
Delays are bad enough.

336
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:45,613
He yelled at your brother today.

337
00:17:46,033 --> 00:17:47,033
What?

338
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,100
What did he say.

339
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:49,333
Nothing serious.

340
00:17:50,466 --> 00:17:51,466
Oh right.

341
00:17:52,133 --> 00:17:53,133
How's your script going?

342
00:17:53,134 --> 00:17:54,600
The producer keeps pushing you.

343
00:17:55,433 --> 00:17:57,233
The great director cares now.

344
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:58,666
No.

345
00:17:58,733 --> 00:17:59,600
If you finish.

346
00:17:59,666 --> 00:18:01,166
We need to revise ours.

347
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:03,766
Pei Jia thinks his
character talks too much.

348
00:18:03,978 --> 00:18:05,333
Too lazy to memorize.

349
00:18:06,466 --> 00:18:07,666
Do you know what his excuse is?

350
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:08,733
What.

351
00:18:08,733 --> 00:18:09,566
He claims.

352
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,865
A spoiled rich kid.

353
00:18:10,866 --> 00:18:12,900
Raised in luxury.

354
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,400
But then.

355
00:18:14,566 --> 00:18:16,166
Talks nonstop to some guy.

356
00:18:18,066 --> 00:18:19,865
I have to nod along.

357
00:18:19,866 --> 00:18:21,932
Before their eight-hour shift ends.

358
00:18:21,933 --> 00:18:23,133
Or charge overtime.

359
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:25,800
Enough.

360
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,299
Go shower.

361
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:30,300
You're covered in foam.

362
00:18:33,033 --> 00:18:34,166
No rush.

363
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,266
Oh.

364
00:18:37,266 --> 00:18:38,266
Midnight.

365
00:18:38,466 --> 00:18:39,499
Need to call them.

366
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,166
Schedule tomorrows scenes.

367
00:18:42,433 --> 00:18:43,865
Im still showering.

368
00:18:43,866 --> 00:18:45,100
Why invite them?

369
00:18:46,133 --> 00:18:46,966
Right

370
00:18:46,966 --> 00:18:47,966
I'll go then.

371
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,100
Not worried about eight hours.

372
00:18:51,533 --> 00:18:52,133
What.

373
00:18:52,133 --> 00:18:53,000
Just a quick visit.

374
00:18:53,066 --> 00:18:54,066
Visits cost money.

375
00:18:57,266 --> 00:18:58,266
Ugh.

376
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,766
This crew is such a disaster.

377
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:04,966
If a lie could last a lifetime.

378
00:19:05,433 --> 00:19:06,700
It must be the truth.

379
00:19:06,933 --> 00:19:08,800
That director has no clue what he's doing.

380
00:19:08,866 --> 00:19:11,100
"Safety take after safety
take" every damn day.

381
00:19:11,266 --> 00:19:12,732
But when I check the dailies.

382
00:19:12,733 --> 00:19:13,733
None of them gets used.

383
00:19:16,266 --> 00:19:18,933
If a lie could last a lifetime, then...

384
00:19:20,233 --> 00:19:21,313
And you know what they did?

385
00:19:21,466 --> 00:19:23,099
The room they assigned me.

386
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:25,566
They paired me with a rookie.

387
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,799
Ten years in this business for this?

388
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,633
If a lie could last a lifetime.

389
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,033
It must be the truth.

390
00:19:31,233 --> 00:19:32,133
For me.

391
00:19:32,134 --> 00:19:33,433
One confession is enough.

392
00:19:39,666 --> 00:19:40,566
And the makeup artist.

393
00:19:40,633 --> 00:19:41,166
Listen to this.

394
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,865
Does her own makeup flawlessly.

395
00:19:43,866 --> 00:19:46,733
But makes me look like a ghost!

396
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:49,833
I'm begging you.

397
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:52,333
Just this once.

398
00:20:01,775 --> 00:20:05,681
(Where are you?
I'm coming to do a room check.)

399
00:20:23,233 --> 00:20:24,233
Where's my keycard?

400
00:20:40,733 --> 00:20:43,033
Didn't I tell you to take the key?

401
00:20:43,933 --> 00:20:44,733
Huh?

402
00:20:44,833 --> 00:20:47,266
I was rushing to see you!

403
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:48,900
Director!

404
00:20:49,233 --> 00:20:50,633
You're early.

405
00:20:53,266 --> 00:20:54,066
Good evening, Director.

406
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:56,533
We just grabbed late-night snacks.

407
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:58,900
Together?

408
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:00,166
Yeah.

409
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,066
Hmm?

410
00:21:01,067 --> 00:21:02,699
We just clicked instantly.

411
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:03,933
Haha exactly!

412
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:08,600
Good.

413
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,500
That's the chemistry I want.

414
00:21:09,501 --> 00:21:11,100
Let's get you a new key.

415
00:21:16,866 --> 00:21:17,866
Coming?

416
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:19,932
Be right there!

417
00:21:19,933 --> 00:21:21,133
Wait up!
