1
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:48,700
"The Sparkle In Your Eye"

2
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:12,700
(1 year ago)

3
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,800
Brother Jia, you've had too much to drink.

4
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,680
This is just getting started.

5
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,199
You're trending again for
getting bashed online today.

6
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,200
The PR team suggested.

7
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,000
That I should leave the industry.

8
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:33,920
Fine by me.

9
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:36,880
Let whoever wants to stay in
this godforsaken industry stay.

10
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,200
But then.

11
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,480
The contractual penalties...

12
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:40,800
Ugh.

13
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,920
If we can't pay, we'll earn it back

14
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,800
I'll talk to the agency.

15
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,480
Anything else?

16
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:51,320
There's a fan letter for you.

17
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,000
More hate mail.

18
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,120
Haven't opened it.

19
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,200
Probably not.

20
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,520
Take a look.

21
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,920
From Yili Crispy Snack.

22
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,720
Cute pseudonym.

23
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:19,920
Be careful.

24
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,079
Some fans recently sent.

25
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,720
Razor blades and death threats.

26
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,640
You need to know.

27
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,880
Your true supporters will always be here.

28
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,240
I'm terminally ill.

29
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,600
Life has lost its meaning.

30
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,480
I think you feel the same.

31
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:56,840
But thinking of you.

32
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,040
Gives me strength to carry on.

33
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,400
So please keep fighting.

34
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:04,840
The rain today.

35
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,960
Means sunshine tomorrow.

36
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,640
My supporters will always be here.

37
00:03:16,463 --> 00:03:18,663
My supporters will always be here.

38
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,200
My supporters will always be here.

39
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,640
Alright.

40
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,600
No more waiting to die.

41
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,320
You were quitting the
industry five minutes ago.

42
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,560
Fang Runzhi's Visionary Talent.

43
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,360
Has been wanting to sign me, right.

44
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,560
Get them on the line.

45
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:55,640
Yes.

46
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,800
Also.

47
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,560
Draft a reply to this fan.

48
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:03,040
Tell them to focus on recovery.

49
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:05,920
Watch me.

50
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,320
Shine brighter than ever.

51
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,200
Got it.

52
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,120
Include a signed photo.

53
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Boss.

54
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:19,120
This is the first time you've
cared this much about a fan.

55
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:35,800
(Episode 3)

56
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,080
It can't be him, right.

57
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,560
What's with the stubbornness.

58
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,160
Who's the real child here.

59
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,040
What a corny analogy.

60
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,600
That analogy is just.

61
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,400
Brother Jia.

62
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,240
Are you at the hotel.

63
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,080
Yes.

64
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,000
That analogy is too...

65
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Uh.

66
00:05:08,816 --> 00:05:11,416
Bring a clean towel to VIP Suite 1.

67
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:12,640
Right away.

68
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,080
No one's in the room.

69
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,320
Deliver a clean towel to VIP Suite 1.

70
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,120
Understood, Brother Jia.

71
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,440
No one told you to look for me.

72
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,960
No one told you to look for me.

73
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,560
Brother Jia, open up.

74
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,640
Keep knocking.

75
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,000
Brother Jia, let me in.

76
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,520
Why would I ask you for a towel.

77
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:42,880
Huh.

78
00:05:42,881 --> 00:05:44,760
Use your damn head.

79
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,560
Leave the takeout outside.

80
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,640
Thanks.

81
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,720
Just say it's you.

82
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,200
It's Teacher Su.

83
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,440
It's Teacher Su.

84
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,400
Ah.

85
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,080
It's you.

86
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,600
Teacher Pei's showering.

87
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,440
Hmm.

88
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,680
Bringing him a towel.

89
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,680
*forced cough*

90
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,319
You should rest now

91
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,320
I won't disturb you.

92
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,520
Oh, Brother Jia.

93
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:43,120
The director wants you and
Teacher Su in his suite by 5.

94
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,720
For tomorrow's important scene.

95
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Noted.

96
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,920
CEO Fang is visiting the set today.

97
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,200
He requested to have dinner with you

98
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,520
I already declined.

99
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,440
But he insists it's mandatory.

100
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,800
Tell him I'm asleep.

101
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,320
Will do

102
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,040
I'll take my leave now.

103
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,200
Wait a moment.

104
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,400
It's almost 5 o'clock

105
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,640
I'll go first.

106
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,600
What's wrong with Teacher Su.

107
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,800
Brat.

108
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,440
Why did Fang Runzhi come.

109
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,120
Not sure.

110
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,480
He just showed up suddenly.

111
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,520
Seems like something urgent.

112
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,800
The most urgent thing now is to
terminate my contract immediately.

113
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,800
Oh, Mr. Fang.

114
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,200
I'm rehearsing with two actors.

115
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,160
Let's skip the meal.

116
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,240
We'll have chances later.

117
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:34,320
Ah.

118
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,560
It's mainly because your
visit was unexpected.

119
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,080
Oh, right

120
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,880
I'll contact you after rehearsal, okay.

121
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:41,920
Hey hey hey.

122
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,600
Investor.

123
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,400
What do you think?
Your brother didn't tell you.

124
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,560
If Mr. Fang hadn't invested.

125
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,720
Our show would be cancelled.

126
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,000
Huh.

127
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Oh, by the way.

128
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,160
For the dinner later.

129
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:54,720
You're coming too.

130
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,040
Oh.

131
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,440
Su Yi is still young.

132
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,240
Why make him go.

133
00:07:58,241 --> 00:07:59,480
He should focus on acting.

134
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,240
Fang Runzhi specifically requested him.

135
00:08:03,176 --> 00:08:04,255
Why does he want him there.

136
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,080
Ask him yourself.

137
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,080
Never mind.

138
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,400
Let's focus on rehearsal.

139
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,520
Hey.

140
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,960
Teacher Pei, perfect timing.

141
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,120
Here's the thing.

142
00:08:12,121 --> 00:08:13,639
Su Bai and I.

143
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,360
Designed a game for you two.

144
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,240
To prepare for tomorrow's intimate scene.

145
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:18,800
Director

146
00:08:18,801 --> 00:08:20,200
I don't think that's necessary.

147
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,680
Wasn't today's rehearsal good enough?

148
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,760
Not enough.

149
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,520
Not enough, come on.

150
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:26,720
Sit.

151
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,800
Haha.

152
00:08:29,196 --> 00:08:30,320
Here's the plan.

153
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,039
Since Mr. Fang is coming tomorrow.

154
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:32,440
Right.

155
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,920
We can't disappoint him.

156
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:34,800
Come, Su Bai.

157
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,040
Explain the game rules.

158
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,040
This game.

159
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,560
Has 36 questions total

160
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,960
I selected 8-10.

161
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:42,520
Here.

162
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,520
Take a look.

163
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,640
What kind of game is this?

164
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,799
This helps you two quickly build.

165
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,320
An emotional connection.

166
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,680
From a famous American psychologist, named...

167
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,720
Arthur Aron.

168
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,000
Right.

169
00:08:58,001 --> 00:09:00,000
Oh, you know about this.

170
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,239
I came across it before.

171
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,880
But don't really understand it.

172
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,120
Just review it.

173
00:09:06,121 --> 00:09:08,120
These are simplified versions.

174
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,840
Start when you're ready.

175
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,960
The director and I will smoke downstairs.

176
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,720
Starting now.

177
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:14,880
What else would you do.

178
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:17,880
Take care.

179
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,040
Bye bro.

180
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:26,600
Hey.

181
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:27,999
What.

182
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,160
You actually want to do this.

183
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,720
If it helps with acting

184
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:33,840
I'll do it.

185
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,840
I don't have time for this.

186
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,120
Then why didn't you say that earlier.

187
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,040
Bullying the weak.

188
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,679
Fine.

189
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:45,680
Come on.

190
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:48,920
First question.

191
00:09:49,031 --> 00:09:50,748
Do you want to be famous? How
would you achieve that?

192
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:53,155
I do, from acting.

193
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,960
Because I realized I really enjoy acting.

194
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,320
Though for you.

195
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,000
It's just part of your routine.

196
00:09:59,040 --> 00:09:59,960
But for me.

197
00:09:59,984 --> 00:10:01,984
Do you have a secret
premonition about the future?

198
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,080
I wasn't finished.

199
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,800
"You do, from acting."

200
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Didn't we finish talking.

201
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,199
Alright, then it's my turn to ask.

202
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,700
What do you think a perfect day is like?

203
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:12,720
Sleep.

204
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,280
Do you have a secret
premonition about the future?

205
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Actually yes.

206
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,040
Maybe death.

207
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,040
That's stating the obvious.

208
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,296
Is that supposed to be a secret.

209
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,320
Of course.

210
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:29,300
What do you think of your
relationship with your mother?

211
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,400
That's private.

212
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,599
Are you close with your family?

213
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,400
That's private.

214
00:10:35,559 --> 00:10:38,159
What role do love and
emotions play in your life?

215
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,280
That's private.

216
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,800
Can you share an embarrassing moment?

217
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:43,880
Now.

218
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,640
How many questions?

219
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,320
Seven.

220
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,600
Then this is the last one.

221
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:58,300
If you could invite anyone,
who would you invite to dinner with you?

222
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,120
Wrap.

223
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,120
You.

224
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,760
Have we really never met before?

225
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,400
No.

226
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,240
Ah.

227
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,400
Why send Su Yi.

228
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,200
Just a dinner.

229
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,240
You know what kind of
person Fang Runzhi is.

230
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,640
The investor.

231
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:10,800
Don't play dumb.

232
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,280
It's just a dinner.

233
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,960
Tell Su Yi to watch his words.

234
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,800
We'll all be there to keep an eye out

235
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,799
But.

236
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,040
Something feels off.

237
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,400
He's in the film industry.

238
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,880
Rumors are common

239
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,200
I've met him a few times.

240
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,600
He's decent.

241
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,160
Su Yi came to me alone this time.

242
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,480
Without telling his family.

243
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,360
I must take good care of him.

244
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,440
Fang Runzhi is calling.

245
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,480
Let's go.

246
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,800
Mr. Fang.

247
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,720
Director Yi, thanks for your hard work.

248
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:02,720
Finally here.

249
00:13:02,721 --> 00:13:04,200
Thanks for making time.

250
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,360
To join us for dinner.

251
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,400
Everyone knows you're busy, Mr. Fang.

252
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,839
Honored you'd dine with our small crew.

253
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,840
Truly

254
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:12,120
I have a big scene tomorrow.

255
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,280
Wrapped early today.

256
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,320
No shop talk.

257
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:16,880
And these are...

258
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:19,640
Our screenwriter Su Bai.

259
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,360
And this is Su Yi.

260
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,400
An up-and-coming actor.

261
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,080
Pei Jia needs no introduction.

262
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,360
Well.

263
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,720
How's Pei Jia been lately.

264
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,200
Not throwing diva tantrums

265
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,560
I've warned him many times.

266
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:32,560
No.

267
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,199
Pei Jia gets along great with us.

268
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,200
Right.

269
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:38,120
He's often giving pointers to the other actors.

270
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,919
Stealing my director's job.

271
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:40,400
So.

272
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,040
We're left dining with you.

273
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,600
Enough formalities.

274
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:44,560
Let's eat.

275
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,000
Please, have a seat.

276
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:49,720
Su Yi.

277
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,800
Yes.

278
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:51,800
Don't be shy.

279
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:52,600
Sit.

280
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,400
Next to your brother.

281
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,520
Okay.

282
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,200
Mr. Fang.

283
00:13:57,201 --> 00:13:58,641
How did you know about our relation?

284
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,880
In this business for years.

285
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,720
Basic background checks are routine.

286
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:04,440
See.

287
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,279
Thought we kept it well hidden.

288
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,880
Nothing to hide really.

289
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,239
If I had such talented
brother as screenwriter

290
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,360
I'd parade it around all the time.

291
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,400
Wow.

292
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:14,120
Make yourself at home.

293
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:14,800
Dig in.

294
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:15,840
Eat up.

295
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:16,880
Here

296
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Mr. Fang.

297
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,680
You really.

298
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,600
Came all this way despite being busy.

299
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,400
You could've just called.

300
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,039
Here.

301
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,040
Let me toast you.

302
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,080
You eat first.

303
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,720
Let me propose a toast to you.

304
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,200
Let me show off this drink for you.

305
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Come on, Mr. Fang

306
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,440
I'll drink it all, you take your time.

307
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,280
Good wine.

308
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,120
Bro

309
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,240
I'm going to the restroom.

310
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,880
No wonder you picked such a great spot.

311
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,640
Mr. Fang has great
taste, this is excellent.

312
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,520
Hey, Xiao Su

313
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,680
Mr. Fang.

314
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,280
Are you a freshman acting major?

315
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,480
I didn't go to college.

316
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,000
Oh, you haven't taken
the college entrance exam.

317
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,720
Uh, I failed the exam.

318
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,400
No worries, college isn't
the only path nowadays.

319
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:13,600
So.

320
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,600
Do you like acting.

321
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,200
Yes.

322
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:19,000
Why not sign with our agency.

323
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,520
Be Teacher Pei's junior.

324
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:27,720
Thank you, Mr. Fang.

325
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:30,680
I need to think it over carefully.

326
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:37,079
OK, I'll give you my assistant's
contact information later.

327
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,879
Let him know when you decide.

328
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:39,880
Got it.

329
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,680
Oh, Mr. Fang's back.

330
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,280
Xiao Su.

331
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,000
The set meals are terrible, right.

332
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,240
Mr. Fang.

333
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,280
My brother just told me about your offer.

334
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,000
You think highly of him.

335
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,080
And see potential in him.

336
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,320
But he's too young.

337
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,560
He still needs to finish school.

338
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,880
It seems

339
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,240
I wasn't asking you.

340
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,080
No problem.

341
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,960
Take your time to consider.

342
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:40,880
Contact me when you decide.

343
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,120
This is a rare opportunity.

344
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,600
Not everyone gets this chance.

345
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,720
Mr. Fang shouldn't forget
old friends for new ones.

346
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,600
Ha ha ha.

347
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,440
Mr. Fang.

348
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,520
As for me

349
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,120
I'll thank you on my brother's behalf.

350
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,440
I have a script to revise.

351
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:00,720
Enjoy your meal

352
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,080
I'll take my leave.

353
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,760
Then I'll go memorize my lines, Mr. Fang.

354
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:14,840
Mr. Fang.

355
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,879
Now that those two rookies are gone.

356
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,920
Let me brief you on our shooting progress.

357
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,920
We've completed 15 scenes.

358
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:21,480
Director Yi.

359
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:21,880
Yes.

360
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,880
Shouldn't you rehearse
the lines with actors.

361
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,440
No need, they're familiar enough.

362
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:29,120
Better go check.

363
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,000
Right away.

364
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,640
Enjoy your meal.

365
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,296
Bro, I have things tomorrow too.

366
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,320
You stay.

367
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:01,720
Bro.

368
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,200
Did I embarrass you.

369
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:07,120
No, it's not about you.

370
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,480
Why did Mr. Fang get angry today.

371
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,520
Being in this industry long enough,

372
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:14,840
you see all kinds.

373
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,720
We can't stand them.

374
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,200
They can't stand us.

375
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,320
Bunch of phonies.

376
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,560
Then why are you angry.

377
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,200
Me.

378
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,600
I'm mad at Yi Wei.

379
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,120
Huh.

380
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,400
He didn't say anything.

381
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,120
Exactly.

382
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,160
Because he stayed silent.

383
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:35,080
Always so eloquent.

384
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,200
But cowered before Fang Runzhi.

385
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,360
When did he become like this.

386
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,840
He's probably smug now.

387
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,256
Thinking he's a smooth operator.

388
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,280
Great at networking.

389
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,320
Maybe he's doing it for the film.

390
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,680
For the film.

391
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,320
Then this film shouldn't succeed.

392
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,080
Director.

393
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,120
Cut.

394
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,400
I can't.

395
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,200
You're spineless too.

396
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,240
Terrible signal.

397
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,400
What's up.

398
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,240
This small project isn't worth your visit.

399
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,200
I thought me performing in this.

400
00:19:47,286 --> 00:19:48,886
Was embarrassing enough for the company.

401
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,280
You did embarrass me.

402
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,600
What now.

403
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,920
Did Jiajia contact you again.

404
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,840
I just got drunk and kissed her.

405
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,480
Hah, she's practically
writing me into her family tree.

406
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:04,800
Just ignore her.

407
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,800
Where have you been these two days.

408
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,720
Sleeping.

409
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,400
I'm asking where you went last night.

410
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,480
You got photographed.

411
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,520
Why do you think I came here.

412
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:36,840
Last night.

413
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,760
Su Yi asked me to deliver
his phone to the police station

414
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,680
I left immediately after dropping it off.

415
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:43,480
The whole thing took
less than five minutes.

416
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,320
Do paparazzi care how long you stayed.

417
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,920
Then how was it handled.

418
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,560
I don't see any leaks though.

419
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,000
Paparazzi work differently now.

420
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,920
They negotiate terms first.

421
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,440
Before deciding to release anything.

422
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Luckily I suppressed it.

423
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:03,840
As long as it's contained.

424
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,760
Your career.

425
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,496
Is already messed up by
your messy relationships.

426
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,720
It's a total mess.

427
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,000
Any new scandal would ruin you.

428
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:14,840
Then.

429
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,520
What do we do now.

430
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,480
Shift the blame to Su Yi.

431
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,320
Also, cut tomorrow's kiss scene.

432
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,576
The subject matter's already sensitive.

433
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,800
Can't risk more complications.

434
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:31,840
Does the director know.

435
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:33,799
No.

436
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:34,840
Find any excuse to cut it.

437
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,600
Go back.

438
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:51,840
Say you love me.

439
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,640
Say you love me now.

440
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:00,600
Say you love me.

441
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:04,880
Ahem.

442
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,440
Say you love me now.

443
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Say you love me.

444
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,400
Say you love me now.

445
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:16,880
Say you love me.

446
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:18,920
Say you love me now.

447
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,280
We're filming.

448
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:22,640
Hey.

449
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,200
We're rehearsing.

450
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,200
I can talk to you now.

451
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:30,120
Do you truly love acting.

452
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,480
Yes

453
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:34,119
I want everyone.

454
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,120
To see me.

455
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:39,120
No need for everyone's approval.

456
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,560
Not approval.

457
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:41,920
Just to be seen.

458
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,720
Just being seen is enough.

459
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,440
What do you think about tomorrow's scene.

460
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,120
The director says it's crucial.

461
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,040
And you.

462
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,080
What do you think.

463
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,400
Important.

464
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,280
Because this might be my only chance.

465
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,800
To act in this lifetime.

466
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,520
There are actually plenty of opportunities.

467
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,520
I was just dragged here by my brother.

468
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,040
Not like you professionals.

469
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,840
Where would I get more chances.

470
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,616
(Tell the director directly that
you wont act with that newbie)

471
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,080
You should go reply to your messages

472
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:32,656
I'll keep practicing alone.

473
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:33,680
Not replying.

474
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,680
The producer's here too.

475
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:38,880
I want to run lines together.

476
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,520
Act out a scene with me.

477
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,120
How novel.

478
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,200
Which part.

479
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,760
The scene before they get together.

480
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,080
Page 8.

481
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,440
Teacher's pet.

482
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:56,840
Haven't even started college yet.

483
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,600
But already acting brain-dead.

484
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:00,480
You are pretty dense.

485
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,400
Let's start.

486
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,600
Look.

487
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:12,440
When you told me about
your family and father.

488
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,000
My heart jumped to my throat.

489
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,040
That's such a cliché metaphor.

490
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:21,360
If you've truly experienced those moments.

491
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:25,119
You'd know those overused metaphors.

492
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,120
Are the most accurate.

493
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,000
Legs like lead.

494
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,080
Eyelids at war.

495
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,920
Uh, eyelids fighting.

496
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
And.

497
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:41,880
Heart in your throat.

498
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,160
Heart in your throat.

499
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,240
Enough.

500
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:47,800
I know.

501
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,560
What do you know.

502
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,760
I can sense.

503
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,520
Something is happening.

504
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,400
Hmm actually.

505
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,360
They really value tomorrow's scene.

506
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,640
Especially that Su Yi.

507
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:18,880
He's acting for the first time

508
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,199
I can stop him whenever I want.

509
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,600
Everyone else can get lost.

510
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:22,400
But.

511
00:25:22,401 --> 00:25:23,440
No buts.

512
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,000
I can feel it too.

513
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:45,520
But I want to tell you.

514
00:25:47,055 --> 00:25:49,095
Even if I imagine liking you.

515
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,600
Or forget you in a moment.

516
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,120
Every moment from now on.

517
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,720
I will have loved you.

518
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,200
Keep going.

519
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Continue.

520
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,640
Hey let me use that.

521
00:26:50,184 --> 00:26:51,200
Here you go, sir.

522
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,200
Oh why are you here.

523
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:57,840
Mr. Su.

524
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:58,680
It's messy here.

525
00:26:58,720 --> 00:26:59,720
Let me handle it.

526
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:04,200
I've been sleeping alone lately.

527
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
I keep having nightmares.

528
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:10,760
What kind of nightmares.

529
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,560
I dreamed.

530
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:14,880
That someone ignored me.

531
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,680
If it weren't for today's key scene.

532
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,200
I wouldn't have come.

533
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,280
No wonder they say
Mr. Su sees the big picture.

534
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,200
I promise you.

535
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:31,400
I won't compromise on work matters.

536
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,640
Never give in.

537
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,640
In personal life I'll yield.

538
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Always compromise.

539
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,080
So dramatic.

540
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,320
Look.

541
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,320
Isn't it pretty.

542
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:44,680
Ouch.

543
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,080
Oh no wait.

544
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,360
Why are you so reckless.

545
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,680
Assistant, get a band-aid.

546
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,400
Does it hurt.

547
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,119
Oh it really hurts.

548
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,120
Painful.

549
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,600
What should we do.

550
00:27:56,991 --> 00:27:57,991
Let me disinfect it.

551
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,120
Then help me disinfect it.

552
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:05,600
Ah.

553
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,080
Don't scream.

554
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:10,280
Now we're even.

555
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:11,720
Hurry and prepare.

556
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:12,720
The actors are arriving.

557
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,080
Fang Runzhi is almost here.

558
00:28:18,464 --> 00:28:19,584
This metaphor is so cliché.

559
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,120
This metaphor is so cliché.

560
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,040
This metaphor is so cliché.

561
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:26,960
This metaphor is so cliché.

562
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,520
It's just a scene.

563
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:31,920
Relax, don't be nervous.

564
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
That's not why.

565
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,760
I remember a scene I had before.

566
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,840
Prepared for over half a month.

567
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,760
But it got deleted.

568
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,000
This industry can be harsh.

569
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,800
This scene won't be cut.

570
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,040
The director values it.

571
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,440
Higher expectations.

572
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:54,520
Bigger disappointment.

573
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,200
First lesson as an actor.

574
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,120
Don't get your hopes up.

575
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,720
Then I'll definitely fail.

576
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,599
Alright everyone quiet.

577
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:05,600
Everyone clear out.

578
00:29:05,601 --> 00:29:06,800
Give them some space.

579
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
3

580
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,280
2

581
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,360
1

582
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,040
Action.

583
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,320
You know.

584
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,520
When you talked about your
dad and family before.

585
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,720
My heart jumped to my throat.

586
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:26,840
Enough.

587
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,200
I understand.

588
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:32,960
What do you understand.

589
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,440
I can sense.

590
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,160
Something is happening.

591
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,600
I can feel it too.

592
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,520
But I want to tell you.

593
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Even if I just imagine liking you.

594
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,480
Or forget you in a moment.

595
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,080
Every moment from now on.

596
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:08,640
I will have loved you
