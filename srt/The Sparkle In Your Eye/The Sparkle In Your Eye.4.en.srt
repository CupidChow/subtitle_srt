00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:48,700
"The Sparkle In Your Eye"

2
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:53,300
(Episode 4)

3
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:15,760
Stop filming.

4
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:16,240
Hey

5
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:16,560
Mr. Fang.

6
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:17,720
Cut, cut, cut! Stop filming.

7
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:19,600
Are you all deaf.

8
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,400
Stop rolling.

9
00:01:20,401 --> 00:01:21,840
Please, have a seat.

10
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,360
Mr. Fang, we'll wrap this scene soon.

11
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,680
Would you mind waiting a moment.

12
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:27,640
Can't wait.

13
00:01:27,641 --> 00:01:28,799
You'll have to wait.

14
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:29,320
Let me explain.

15
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,999
We spent ages designing this scene.

16
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,560
Filming this is too risky.

17
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,600
Shut it down now.

18
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,120
It's alright, Mr. Fang.

19
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,960
We can delete anything in post-production

20
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,480
I said pause it.

21
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,439
Nothing jeopardizes the theatrical release.

22
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:48,200
And I need to protect
our talent. Understood.

23
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,600
Understood.

24
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,400
Director Yi.

25
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,800
Can we still shoot if we cut this scene.

26
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:57,800
We can.

27
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:58,600
Good.

28
00:01:58,601 --> 00:02:00,040
Thought it was impossible.

29
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,960
Let's take a five-minute break.

30
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,640
Delete the footage.

31
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,640
Done.

32
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,680
Wasn't this scene supposed to be cut.

33
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,040
Why didn't you mention it.

34
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,200
Hey.

35
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,800
I didn't get the chance.

36
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,040
Frankly, I'd forgotten too.

37
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,360
Forgot or conveniently omitted.

38
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,560
Seemed like you were enjoying it.

39
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,440
I genuinely forgot.

40
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,200
Memorizing lines these days.

41
00:02:30,201 --> 00:02:31,800
Has made my memory deteriorate.

42
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,960
Ask Su Yi if you don't believe me.

43
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,960
You knew this scene
was getting cut all along.

44
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,920
I didn't mean to keep it from you.

45
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,840
This industry gets complicated.

46
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,400
I don't understand your world.

47
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,600
You want a scene cut, it gets cut.

48
00:02:57,576 --> 00:02:58,816
You want a recast, you get one.

49
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,800
I'm powerless here.

50
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,959
So what do you expect.

51
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,359
What else can I do.

52
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,800
At least stop toying with me.

53
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,200
Why didn't you tell me yesterday.

54
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,960
Made me play along like some puppet.

55
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,840
I just didn't want to crush your passion.

56
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,880
Couldn't bear to.

57
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,320
I see.

58
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,200
In your precious industry.

59
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,240
This is how you treat the dedicated ones.

60
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,560
I saw it.

61
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,240
But Fang Runzhi was on set.

62
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,240
Didn't want to cause drama.

63
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:00,920
Upset.

64
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,239
Damn right.

65
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,640
You just rolled over for him.

66
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,200
His word is law.

67
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,640
His word really si law.

68
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:08,720
If he's displeased.

69
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:09,840
The whole production halts.

70
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,760
Then let's not shoot.

71
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,400
Look, I know you're frustrated.

72
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:22,600
But make the necessary adjustments.

73
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,640
Alright.

74
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,760
This scene is crucial.

75
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,080
Can't we negotiate.

76
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,760
Please.

77
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:34,880
Mandatory cut.

78
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,240
Investors dictate our priorities.

79
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,480
Like a puppet.

80
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,680
Nobody cares.

81
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,200
(Shooting Day 4)

82
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,199
Yes, Ms. Pei Jia was phenomenal,
absolutely phenomenal.

83
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:58,120
But let's try to amplify the
emotional intensity a bit more.

84
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,720
Sink into the characters' perspectives.

85
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,680
That's a wrap! Wrap.

86
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,120
I'm dead on my feet.

87
00:05:06,121 --> 00:05:07,839
What's with this chaotic schedule.

88
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,376
Haven't shot a single
scene of mine all day.

89
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,120
Just catching up on your backlogged scenes.

90
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,039
Outstanding, truly outstanding performance.

91
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:16,720
No issues whatsoever.

92
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:17,560
Right, we'll keep one solid take.

93
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,959
Haha, stellar work all around.

94
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,400
Does Su Yi's scene need adjustments?

95
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,520
What kind of amateur footage is this.

96
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,440
Let's go again.

97
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,480
For heaven's sake.

98
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,800
Back on set.

99
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,799
Mr. Fang's orders.

100
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,680
We proceed only if that scene gets cut.

101
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:49,521
From now on, they won't interfere
with any of our creative decisions.

102
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,600
I just don't know what I've become.

103
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,136
Why don't you just kick me out
and rewrite the script yourselves.

104
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,920
Then Chief Fang would
definitely be pleased.

105
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,160
Why are you so fixated on that scene.

106
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:02,360
Alright, let's go.

107
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,416
(Shooting Day 10)
Cut. Let's do another take.

108
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,440
Uh, Teacher Pei.

109
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,759
Let's work on blocking the scene.

110
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,560
We'll figure it out ourselves.

111
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,560
Adjust your framing.

112
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,120
Scene 12, Shot 1, Take 1.

113
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,100
(Shooting Day 13)

114
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,160
By the way, Brother Jia.

115
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,816
Chief Fang and Director
Yi are having dinner tonight.

116
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,080
They asked if you want to join.

117
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,400
No, I'm exhausted from working all day

118
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,800
I'll just shoot whatever changes they make.

119
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:29,760
Understood.

120
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,600
Xiao Su.

121
00:06:30,624 --> 00:06:31,416
(Shooting Day 17)

122
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,600
Can you do your job properly.

123
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,480
What are you doing?

124
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,480
Cut.

125
00:06:34,481 --> 00:06:36,520
Don't waste everyone's time.

126
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,759
The whole crew is waiting on you.

127
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,360
Sorry, my apologies.

128
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,160
(Shooting Day 20) How much
longer do you need to get in character?

129
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:39,880
Xiao Su.

130
00:06:39,881 --> 00:06:41,639
Why can't you learn from Teacher Pei.

131
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,160
Huh.

132
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,520
We're finishing everything today.

133
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,600
Hey.

134
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,160
Where's Su Yi.

135
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,280
They're lovers.

136
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,040
Do you understand what lovers mean.

137
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,592
Lovers can express
themselves in different ways.

138
00:06:53,617 --> 00:06:54,772
(Three days left.)

139
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,520
But there's passion between them.

140
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:03,360
(One Day Left) Brother Jia, you're
not interested in that Su Yi, are you?

141
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,960
I notice you treat him differently.

142
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,760
What's wrong.

143
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,040
The previous scandal hasn't blown over yet.

144
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,120
If another rumor surfaces,
we'll be in big trouble.

145
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:18,960
Don't be ridiculous

146
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,600
I'm Pei Jia.

147
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,160
As for me.

148
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,080
I just think he's a rookie.

149
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Just messing with him.

150
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,960
Would I ever take him seriously.

151
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,880
Good. Just wanted to remind you.

152
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,360
Hurry up and leave, I'm resting.

153
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,160
So you were here all along.

154
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,040
I thought you'd left.

155
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,200
I'm here. I've always been here.

156
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:11,760
It's nothing.

157
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,440
Just pretend I'm not here.

158
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,440
After all, you're Pei Jia.

159
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:20,760
Hey.

160
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,840
Don't walk away.

161
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,199
Tomorrow's our final scene.

162
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,240
Let's rehearse together.

163
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,200
There's no point in
toying with people like this.

164
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,440
Do you know how childish you're being.

165
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,040
You don't even care
about the quality of acting.

166
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,800
Only I take this seriously.

167
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,960
I used to have feelings for you.

168
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,120
But now I just want to act well

169
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,800
I don't care if it's
the final scene or not.

170
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,279
We're wrapping tomorrow.

171
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,561
But the script for the final
scene still isn't finalized.

172
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,600
Don't worry

173
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,520
I'll finish the revisions.

174
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,120
Let's do this properly.

175
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,160
Alright.

176
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,680
As long as we're not lovers.

177
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,120
Everything will be fine.

178
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,959
Remember to keep your
profile during the dialogue.

179
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:33,480
Action

180
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,160
3

181
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:34,960
2

182
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:35,760
1

183
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:36,360
Go.

184
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,160
Xiao Su.

185
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,520
Look at Pei Jia.

186
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,360
Hey.

187
00:09:39,361 --> 00:09:40,719
Smile.

188
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,680
Come on.

189
00:09:41,681 --> 00:09:43,880
More affection between you.

190
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:44,920
Ah.

191
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,400
We have each other now.

192
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:47,800
- Sound.
- Right

193
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:48,800
I can't hear the lines.

194
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:49,960
Sound department!

195
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,279
Just improvise.

196
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:53,240
It's not my script anymore anyway.

197
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,199
Lean into his embrace.

198
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,080
Yes.

199
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,400
Perfect.

200
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:04,520
Happy wrap.

201
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:10,440
Thank you all for your
hard work. That's a wrap.

202
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:15,360
Great work everyone. Pack up.

203
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,160
Happy wrap, Teacher Pei.

204
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:23,080
Finally wrapped.

205
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,920
Drinks tonight.

206
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,400
Brother Jia, Director Yi just said

207
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,160
to schedule a wrap party this week.

208
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,000
Who wants to eat with him.

209
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,440
Tell him I'm booked.

210
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:40,880
Got it.

211
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,680
Then let's hit the club now.

212
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Wait.

213
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,080
Stop the car.

214
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,680
Why are you walking alone here.

215
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,320
Buses stopped running.

216
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,480
Where's Su Bai.

217
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:26,800
Get in

218
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:27,800
I'll give you a ride.

219
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:38,760
Let's go.

220
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,520
It's all fake anyway.

221
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:59,480
Damn, he's so hot.

222
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,240
Su Yi.

223
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:23,440
What are you doing here.

224
00:13:23,441 --> 00:13:24,656
Been looking everywhere for you.

225
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:28,080
Thought you had plans
with the director so I left first.

226
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,599
What kind of plans.

227
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,640
We broke up.

228
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:31,680
What.

229
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,440
I'm not drunk, you should go.

230
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:44,960
Come here first.

231
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,479
See? I can stand straight.

232
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,400
Straight or not.

233
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,640
Ahhh.

234
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:57,560
Here, drink some water.

235
00:13:57,561 --> 00:13:59,239
No.

236
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,240
Get out.

237
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:04,360
Then Brother Jia, I'll take off first.

238
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,440
Call me if anything.

239
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,040
You left just because he told you to.

240
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,480
Yiyi, come back.

241
00:14:32,914 --> 00:14:36,844
[He's searching for Xiao Su on Weibo]

242
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,200
(One week later)

243
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,976
You've been coming for three days straight.
Still not giving up.

244
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Boss.

245
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,640
I desperately need this job.

246
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,599
You quit abruptly before.

247
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,320
Now we have a bartender.

248
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,999
Sorry Boss

249
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,200
I'll do anything.

250
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,800
Just let me stay.

251
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:38,840
Alright then.

252
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,080
Clean up after closing every night.

253
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,400
Thank you Boss.

254
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:32,160
Believe this, those who
love you will always be there.

255
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:33,840
I have a serious illness.

256
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,640
Lost all hope in life.

257
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,800
You must believe.

258
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,760
Those who love you will always be there.

259
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,800
You must believe.

260
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,800
Those who love you will always be there.

261
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,240
You must believe.

262
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,200
Those who love you will always be there.

263
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:54,039
Well, if it isn't Teacher Pei.

264
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,239
What an honor.

265
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,840
Come on now, famous director.

266
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:57,880
Let's sit.

267
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:00,960
What brings you here.

268
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,000
Just wanted a large poster
from our previous project.

269
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,840
It was my lead role after all.

270
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,776
You came personally
for such a trivial matter.

271
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:09,800
Should've just called.

272
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,080
Let me know

273
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,800
I'd have delivered it.

274
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:15,200
Had some free time anyway.

275
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,999
Seems someone told me recently.

276
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,120
They were swamped with work.

277
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,920
I specifically cleared
my schedule to see you.

278
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:23,760
Hmm.

279
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,439
It's been ages since we met.

280
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:28,520
Yeah, after the wrap we
all went our separate ways.

281
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,800
Never got to properly reunite.

282
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:35,560
Hey, haven't seen Teacher Su lately.

283
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,559
He.

284
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:38,840
Probably took on new projects.

285
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:42,040
He dumped me right after wrap.

286
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,839
Haven't heard from him since.

287
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,200
Su Yi went with him.

288
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,160
Su Yi.

289
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,920
He's back working at the bar.

290
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,240
Which one.

291
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,919
After the breakup.

292
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,280
We haven't been able to reach him.

293
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,040
Not sure.

294
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,439
I'm talking about Su Yi.

295
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,440
What's wrong with him.

296
00:18:08,887 --> 00:18:11,447
What's the name of Su Yi's bar.

297
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,720
Uh... Gimel... I think.

298
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,400
It's called Glimmer, right.

299
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,480
Glimmer.

300
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,680
Glimmer.

301
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:25,999
Hey.

302
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Are you free after work later.

303
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,080
Still working.

304
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:32,160
Stop working.

305
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,160
Let's go get a drink.

306
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:34,720
Like this.

307
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:35,960
At Su Yi's place

308
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,120
I'll help you sound
out Su Bai's intentions.

309
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,040
Hmm.

310
00:18:54,041 --> 00:18:55,840
Do you have other bartenders here.

311
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,440
No, just me.

312
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,480
I remember this is
definitely the right bar.

313
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,960
Maybe he's not here today.

314
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,879
Since we're already here.

315
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:06,880
Let's have a drink.

316
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:16,880
Enjoy your drinks.

317
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,440
Here.

318
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,679
The reason they did that.

319
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:41,079
Is because we wrote the plot to that point.

320
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,199
They had no choice but to do it.

321
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,520
Right, they couldn't avoid it.

322
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,920
We wrote the script.

323
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,960
We could tone down the earlier parts.

324
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,359
Let them progress to.

325
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,080
Holding hands.

326
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,080
Kissing.

327
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,200
Weaken the plot progression.

328
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,480
Make them keep at least one meter apart.

329
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:55,920
When they get intimate.

330
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,719
Have one person immediately
push the other away.

331
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:58,920
That's not love at all.

332
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,400
They're lovers.

333
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,400
Without passion between them.

334
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,560
Can they still be called lovers.

335
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,400
Listen.

336
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,439
Su Bai.

337
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,440
Is stubborn.

338
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,400
He blows small matters out of proportion.

339
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,240
He's both stubbornly
serious and oversensitive.

340
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,320
And completely inflexible.

341
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,879
I'm running around the film set.

342
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,200
Without a moment's rest.

343
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,000
Then I come home to manage his moods.

344
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,440
Is this easy for me.

345
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,440
It's really not.

346
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,160
Every time he offends someone.

347
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,440
I'm the one bowing and scraping.

348
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,960
Making apologies.

349
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,360
Right.

350
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,560
It's good to have artistic standards.

351
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,600
But you can't fight the system.

352
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:09,680
Hmm

353
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,040
I've advised him many times

354
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,279
I said.

355
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:14,839
You need to be nicer to the producers.

356
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,240
And investors.

357
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,280
More polite.

358
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,840
But he won't listen.

359
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,559
I mean.

360
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,200
How much pressure have I endured for him.

361
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:25,399
How many bullets have I taken for him.

362
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,640
He doesn't see any of it.

363
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,960
I'm becoming a human pincushion.

364
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,200
I'll fix the script.

365
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,560
Don't be angry anymore.

366
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:54,680
Come on.

367
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,680
Let's.

368
00:21:55,681 --> 00:21:56,999
Take care of each other.

369
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Okay.

370
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:00,680
As long as we're not lovers.

371
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:04,080
Everything will be fine.

372
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:10,999
Can we stop talking about this.

373
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,079
No.

374
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,400
Why avoid the subject again.

375
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,280
I don't want to talk.

376
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,600
I can't explain.

377
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,040
Take our last production.

378
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,200
They wanted their own actors.

379
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,080
He stubbornly refused.

380
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,240
If I hadn't mediated.

381
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,360
That project would've collapsed.

382
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,640
And he criticized me.

383
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,160
Called me a social climber.

384
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,840
How could he.

385
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,400
Absolutely unreasonable.

386
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,759
Fine.

387
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,720
Don't want to talk.

388
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,439
Stay away from me.

389
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,680
Do whatever, I'm tired.

390
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,800
And now you're giving me attitude.

391
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,240
Just you wait.

392
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:01,000
Even if you beg me to get back together.

393
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,480
I wouldn't agree even if hell freezes over.

394
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,160
Su Bai.

395
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,840
You'll live to regret this.

396
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:54,679
Oh sir, good evening.

397
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:55,920
We're closing soon, I'm afraid.

398
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:32,600
I can feel...

399
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,920
there's something unfolding.

400
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,439
There was only one
customer in this heavy rain.

401
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,480
Seems like an actor too.

402
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,360
Who is it.

403
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,360
Take a guess.

404
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,680
Pei Jia
