(Episode 9)

5
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,679
Hi, did you see that guy Su Yi just now?

6
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,759
Uh... no.

7
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:13,920
No?

8
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,999
Hi, have you seen Su Yi?

9
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:22,960
Su Yi?
No.

10
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,040
Excuse me.
Did you

11
00:01:26,001 --> 00:01:27,719
see Su Yi, the guy was right here?

12
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:28,520
Sorry,

13
00:01:28,521 --> 00:01:30,599
did you see Su Yi?

14
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:31,400
You didn't see him?
No.

15
00:01:32,161 --> 00:01:34,000
Did you see Su Yi?

16
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,720
No.

17
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,239
(One year ago)
Pei.

18
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,740
Hi there.

19
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:53,920
Mr. Fang.

20
00:01:53,921 --> 00:01:55,241
Look forward to working with you.

21
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,480
Okay, work hard.

22
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,560
I'll call the police.

23
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,080
What did you do to me?

24
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,920
I've got some souvenirs.

25
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,800
Where is Pei Jia?

26
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,320
I need to see him.

27
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,200
If you don't want to stay in this circle,

28
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,320
just leave.

29
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,560
Su Yi,

30
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,599
take a look

31
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,880
at the photos I just took.

32
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,160
Help yourself.

33
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,600
These are not some promotional photos.

34
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:18,480
Think about it, if these
photos are released,

35
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,200
what will Pei Jia's fans think?

36
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,800
Deleting them won't help.

37
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,559
Whenever I want,

38
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,440
these photos can go viral.

39
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,080
I...

40
00:03:39,081 --> 00:03:41,759
I didn't do anything with Pei Jia.

41
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,320
We were just pretending.

42
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,840
But what if I say,

43
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,760
"You're mine now,"

44
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,040
what would he do?

45
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,040
For what he can offer

46
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,200
and he can't offer,

47
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,400
I always can give you.

48
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,239
It's the guy from the signing event.

49
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,200
Did you see him?
Nope.

50
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,600
Sorry,

51
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,680
did you see Su Yi?
No.

52
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,040
Hey,

53
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,280
look.

54
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,599
That's why he's famous.

55
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,000
He's always active in these events.

56
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:26,960
You'll get there too.

57
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,720
Have you seen Su Yi?

58
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,880
What?

59
00:04:31,881 --> 00:04:33,040
Su Yi's gone missing.

60
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:51,140
Pei Jia.

61
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,360
No,
I didn't find him.

62
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,240
He didn't answer my calls.
Me neither.

63
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,800
What now?

64
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:28,640
Don't worry.

65
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,920
Take a breath.

66
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,799
How can I not be worried?

67
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,240
He's my brother.

68
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,240
You worry too much.

69
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,400
Maybe he just got drunk
and forgot his phone.

70
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,920
Yi Wei,

71
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,400
is there something you're
really worried about?

72
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,480
Listen,

73
00:05:43,481 --> 00:05:44,679
at parties like this,

74
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,039
they always reserve rooms

75
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,800
for drunk people.

76
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,840
Maybe he just passed
out in one of those rooms.

77
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,040
I'm worried about him.

78
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,120
Don't worry,

79
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,880
Su Yi's smart and discreet.

80
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,480
He should be fine.

81
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Really?

82
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,120
Trust me.

83
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:07,520
Maybe he'll call us when he wakes up.

84
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,800
Okay?

85
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,320
Pei Jia,
stop looking for him.

86
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,360
Su Yi's probably asleep in some room.

87
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,199
I'll ask the receptionist.

88
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,000
Listen,

89
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,120
you know

90
00:06:27,121 --> 00:06:29,239
all rooms are booked for events like this.

91
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,360
How would you find out?

92
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,840
Why are you more worried than me?

93
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,359
Nothing bad will happen, right?

94
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,280
No way,

95
00:06:35,281 --> 00:06:36,400
so many people around.

96
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,520
But Fang Runzhi...

97
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,440
What?

98
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,920
What did you say?

99
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,400
Nothing...

100
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,360
He should be fine.

101
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,240
Well,

102
00:06:51,241 --> 00:06:52,440
you two may leave.

103
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,640
I'll keep looking for him.

104
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,719
Mr. Su?

105
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,479
Mr. Pei has been looking for you.

106
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,760
Want to call him back?

107
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,640
No, thanks.

108
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:30,540
(Bai, I'm fine. I was drunk and
fell asleep last night. Don't worry.)

109
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,920
Alas.

110
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,280
Awake?

111
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,320
Time for breakfast.

112
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,400
I got a message from Su Yi.

113
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:46,760
Look at you,

114
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,880
you didn't even sleep well.

115
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,080
Didn't I tell you to leave last night?

116
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,240
I left.

117
00:07:55,241 --> 00:07:57,480
I went out for a walk, then came back.

118
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,720
What's wrong?

119
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,160
Don't want to eat?

120
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,360
No appetite?

121
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,200
Before,

122
00:08:10,201 --> 00:08:12,080
it was me who ran
around buying food for you.

123
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:20,800
I remember you used to get stomachaches.

124
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,079
Look at you,

125
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:24,760
when you get busy

126
00:08:24,761 --> 00:08:26,200
and skip meals,

127
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,680
you're bound to hurt your stomach.

128
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:28,560
Here.

129
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,080
Have some porridge.

130
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,880
Alright, stop.

131
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,520
Let's eat together.

132
00:08:45,521 --> 00:08:46,840
I can't finish all of them.

133
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,680
I didn't know what your favorite is,

134
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:50,920
so I bought them all.

135
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,880
But you've always known my favorites.

136
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,360
Isn't that my duty?

137
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,320
Yeah, so I shouldn't
neglect your preferences.

138
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,120
When you left before,

139
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:10,680
I'd lie in bed thinking

140
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:13,040
that I'm not even a man.

141
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,280
Why say that?

142
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,239
I always enjoyed you running around for me.

143
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,240
Stop.

144
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,120
Don't get all emotional and apologetic now.

145
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,360
I mean, what did I do?

146
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,039
I knew

147
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,320
how to treat someone right.

148
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,520
Even if I didn't know it,

149
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,600
since we've been together a long time,

150
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,000
I should have learned by now.

151
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,560
Su Bai,

152
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,240
from now on,

153
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,680
I'll try to love you like you love me.

154
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,440
I promise

155
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,040
I'll always be on your side.

156
00:09:59,040 --> 00:09:59,920
Hey, Su Yi,

157
00:09:59,921 --> 00:10:01,479
why are you here?

158
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,160
I'm here to work.

159
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,840
Didn't you become an actor?

160
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,320
Sorry, I have to

161
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,440
work for a few days more.

162
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,160
Keep bartending.

163
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,119
So, no one will see you sweeping here.

164
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,360
Or your fans will curse me.

165
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:20,560
Hey, not thirsty?

166
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
What's wrong with you?

167
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,720
Still thinking about Pei Jia?

168
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,440
It's fine.

169
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,679
I'll just sweep

170
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,560
and wash cups inside.

171
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,680
No one will notice me.

172
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,040
Su Bai?

173
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,640
Did Su Yi reply to your messages?

174
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,919
Su Yi told me he's fine this morning.

175
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,440
Then why didn't he answer my calls?

176
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,279
He doesn't answer your
calls perhaps because

177
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,440
he's avoiding you?

178
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,319
No way!

179
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,680
Thanks for caring about him last night,

180
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,560
but Su Yi's avoiding you now.

181
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,680
It's not right to keep chasing him.

182
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,360
Is Su Yi with you?

183
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,080
Tell him to answer now.

184
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,360
He's not with me.

185
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,720
He's not with me.

186
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,080
Why didn't you answer my calls?

187
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:38,960
What's going on?

188
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,080
What happened?

189
00:12:41,081 --> 00:12:42,559
Just tell me.

190
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,680
About what?

191
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,960
Did Fang Ruizhi...

192
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,600
Mr. Fang?

193
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,480
Did Fang Ruizhi...

194
00:12:58,760 --> 00:12:59,760
Pei Jia,

195
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,400
just because you don't care about gender

196
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,200
doesn't mean everyone does.

197
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,640
Fang Runzhi likes men.

198
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,200
I don't like men.

199
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,760
I'm not interested in you either.

200
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,040
No way I'd be with him.

201
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,120
Stop lying, Su Yi.

202
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,520
I'm not lying.

203
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,880
I just don't like you.

204
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
You don't like me?

205
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,320
Fine.

206
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,160
Here's the truth, Pei Jia.

207
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:55,999
When I got close to you,

208
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,239
hugged you, kissed you,

209
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,280
I wanted your connections.

210
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,000
Now I have everything I want.

211
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,640
No need to pretend anymore.

212
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,320
You think I'll believe that?

213
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:15,960
Don't believe me?

214
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,720
Then my acting must be good.

215
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,960
I'm already in the company.

216
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,080
I've got many roles.

217
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,920
Many people can see me.

218
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,720
No more sweeping and washing cups.

219
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,800
Even if I go blind or die on the street,

220
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,360
no one would notice.

221
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,760
If I hurt you, I'm sorry.

222
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,120
But I don't regret it.

223
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,040
You're really good at pretending.

224
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,800
Really good.

225
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:48,960
Those who look better than you

226
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:50,960
and act better than you

227
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,560
are everywhere.

228
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,200
But he only likes you.

229
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:58,640
Be good.

230
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,920
If you behave good

231
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,760
and keep it from everyone,

232
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,280
Pei Jia is still a big star.

233
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,280
And you are still a promising newcomer.
