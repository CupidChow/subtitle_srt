00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:48,700
"The Sparkle In Your Eye"

2
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:53,300
(Episode 6)

3
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,600
Brother Fang, what did you
need to see me about today?

4
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,400
You went to do that restaurant
ribbon-cutting ceremony.

5
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,680
Brother Fang, I'm really sorry.

6
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,200
Just wrapped the shoot.

7
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,200
Finished the project,
got a bit carried away.

8
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:25,160
But honestly, the
schedule's been packed solid.

9
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,200
You haven't been to the company in ages.

10
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,760
We just renovated the office recently.

11
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,120
You didn't even come to our ribbon-cutting.

12
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,160
Do you even realize what
career phase you're in right now?

13
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,399
So many eyes are on you.

14
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,160
Countless people
waiting for you to stumble.

15
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,240
What does that have to do with anything.

16
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,880
You were practically forced into acting.

17
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,640
You know how many idols.

18
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,760
End up grilling skewers on the street.

19
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,000
Or selling clothes in shops.

20
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,120
If I hadn't signed you.

21
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,639
You should be capitalizing
on your current clout.

22
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,560
And fanbase.

23
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,600
To make more money.

24
00:02:00,601 --> 00:02:02,000
And secure your position.

25
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,600
Between BBQ and clothing

26
00:02:03,601 --> 00:02:04,801
I'd recommend selling clothes.

27
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,400
You hate the heat.

28
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,160
Stores have AC.

29
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,360
Brother Fang

30
00:02:09,361 --> 00:02:11,160
I understand your concerns.

31
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,360
This was my mistake.

32
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,240
Won't happen again.

33
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,480
Got other commitments

34
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,200
I need to go.

35
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:40,840
Brother Jia.

36
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:43,160
We'll do the costume
fitting before going shopping.

37
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,520
The stylists are already waiting.

38
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,160
Three public appearances this afternoon.

39
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,160
All outfits are brand-sponsored.

40
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,280
Any paparazzi bothering you lately.

41
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,240
No, why? Did something happen?

42
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,520
Nothing. How many
engagements this afternoon.

43
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,280
Three today, three more tomorrow.

44
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,440
Tonight, Mr. Fang is meeting a producer.

45
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,480
Who's launching an S-tier drama.

46
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,120
Exploring collaboration possibilities.

47
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:21,720
Hello.

48
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,439
Is this Mr. Su Yi.

49
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,800
Are you available for an audition?

50
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:26,960
Hello.

51
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,000
Hi.

52
00:03:28,001 --> 00:03:29,920
Here's my acting portfolio.

53
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:32,840
Greetings, panel members
I'm Su Yi

54
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,120
19 years old

55
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,200
I've prepared a monologue.

56
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,360
Which acting academy did you graduate from?

57
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,040
No formal training, sir.

58
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,599
Nineteen.

59
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,680
No college education.

60
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:56,880
My first piece is.

61
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,800
Untrained actors never work out.

62
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,560
Can you come for a callback tomorrow.

63
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,600
Let me check my schedule.

64
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:18,760
Waiter.

65
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,800
Coming.

66
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,960
Get ice now.

67
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,600
One more mistake and you're fired.

68
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,800
But I have strong emotional resonance

69
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,360
I can master scripts in minutes.

70
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,000
Watch your timing.

71
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:36,880
Yes sir.
Right away.

72
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:47,039
I really want this role.

73
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,400
It means everything to me.

74
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,680
Begin.

75
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,400
Ahem.

76
00:04:50,401 --> 00:04:53,600
Sunlight filters through the café window.

77
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,320
My lips curl involuntarily.

78
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,000
Cut.
Overact.

79
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,080
OK OK

80
00:05:02,081 --> 00:05:03,520
That was... interesting.

81
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,839
- We'll be in touch.
- My later performance gets more nuanced.

82
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:06,640
No problem.
We've seen enough.

83
00:05:07,601 --> 00:05:08,640
The take is recorded.

84
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,200
Await our decision.

85
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,599
You're not in the right state.

86
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,000
At this rate.

87
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,360
The director won't cast you.

88
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:14,999
Such a prime opportunity.

89
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,200
How could you blow it?

90
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,000
Cut.

91
00:05:18,001 --> 00:05:19,640
Do you understand this character?

92
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,160
I'm auditioning
I mean this performance.

93
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,160
Is completely off.

94
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,439
Director, I prepared another take.

95
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,839
With different emotional layers.

96
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:27,760
Next.

97
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,879
Bring in the next candidate.

98
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:29,936
Next time, find someone decent.

99
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,440
Thank you, teacher.

100
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,560
Alright, you've worked hard.

101
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,720
You've worked hard, teacher.

102
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,159
What do you mean by next time.

103
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,400
There won't be a next time.

104
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,600
Thanks.

105
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,160
I really wish you could be by my side.

106
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,039
You.

107
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,200
Where are you?

108
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,640
Bro.

109
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,160
Bro, why are you here.

110
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,640
You didn't even tell me in advance.

111
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,600
Can't I just come check on you?

112
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:26,120
Why did they replace the bartender?

113
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,360
Wasn't that you?

114
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,200
Yes.

115
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,400
Letting him try today.

116
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,480
Then you didn't train him well.

117
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,120
The gin flavor in this Negroni.

118
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,200
It's too strong.

119
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,440
Huh? Really.

120
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,640
Hmm, it is a bit.

121
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,879
Bro, why don't you go home first?

122
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,320
I'll make you another one tonight.

123
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
No need.

124
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,480
How have you been lately?

125
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,360
I heard you went to an audition.

126
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,480
How did it go?

127
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Hmm.

128
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,640
Listen to me.

129
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:06,880
Go back to school.

130
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:09,880
Bro.

131
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,200
Hmm.

132
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,520
I really want to act.

133
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,839
Xiao Yi.

134
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,440
You're just a rookie with nothing.

135
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,199
Why would they choose you?

136
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,080
It's not too late to go back to school.

137
00:07:21,081 --> 00:07:22,680
We've talked about this.

138
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:23,840
Let's not discuss this.

139
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,960
Fine, no more talking.

140
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,520
Then I'm heading back.

141
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,000
During the dubbing days.

142
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,160
Remember to take time off.

143
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,480
Okay.

144
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:45,280
Leaving.

145
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,440
Take care, bro.

146
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,600
Take time off.

147
00:07:48,601 --> 00:07:49,961
Still thinking about taking leave.

148
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,080
Manager

149
00:07:51,081 --> 00:07:53,080
I'll go borrow ice from
the neighboring bar now.

150
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:53,760
Ah

151
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,800
I'll cover the cost.

152
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,360
You just came back a few days ago.

153
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,039
What did you promise me before.

154
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,560
Now you're careless with prep work.

155
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,200
Even messed up basic tasks.

156
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,120
Now you're drinking with
customers during work hours.

157
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,440
That was my brother

158
00:08:07,441 --> 00:08:08,599
I don't care who he is.

159
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,560
Our shop is small,

160
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,160
can't afford a big Buddha like you.

161
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,880
Even if I imagine myself liking you.

162
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,400
But.

163
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I want to tell you.

164
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,560
Even if I imagine myself liking you.

165
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,440
Or forget you later.

166
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:27,960
Every moment

167
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,400
I've loved you.

168
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:33,080
Brother Jia, Mr. Fang
asked if you're free tonight.

169
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,440
No.

170
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,480
Tell him I have a fever.

171
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Okay.

172
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,040
Brother Jia, it's time.

173
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:43,800
Let's go.

174
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,639
How did I do today.

175
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,640
Not bad.

176
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,000
Exceptionally not bad.

177
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,080
Hey.

178
00:08:58,081 --> 00:09:00,600
That Su... what's his name.

179
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:01,920
Is he coming.

180
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,440
Hmm, Teacher Su Bai.

181
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,000
Probably not.

182
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,480
No.

183
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,600
Su Yi.

184
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,680
Should be coming.

185
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,360
Should be coming.

186
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Director.

187
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,040
Ah.

188
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,440
You look exhausted.

189
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,200
Ugh.

190
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,240
Dubbing while sick, Pei Jia.

191
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,640
Mr. Fang.

192
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,320
What brings you here.

193
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,200
If I weren't here.

194
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,360
Could you just casually
reschedule your notice?

195
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:53,520
Mr. Fang is just deeply
invested in our show.

196
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,360
Mainly here to see
what Pei Jia's been up to.

197
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,056
The talent can be a
bit difficult to manage.

198
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:58,960
Don't be too harsh on him.

199
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,600
He's still on medication and recovering.

200
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,960
Huh? Is it serious.

201
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:04,880
Coughs

202
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,240
I'll head in first.

203
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,440
Coughs.

204
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:11,800
You should rest for a bit.

205
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,520
What do you think you know.

206
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,000
What do you know.

207
00:10:24,001 --> 00:10:26,600
How painfully accurate
those cliché metaphors are?

208
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,040
Since we're all here now.

209
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,400
Let's test the equipment.

210
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,080
Wait for my cue.
Standby to roll.

211
00:10:33,801 --> 00:10:36,800
Actually, when you first told me.

212
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:52,800
Su Yi.

213
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,240
Alright.

214
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,880
Why haven't you been
replying to my messages?

215
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:03,800
They can hear us.

216
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,440
The equipment isn't even on yet.

217
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,520
Let's run through the lines again

218
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,640
I've already memorized them.

219
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,280
Well

220
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,720
I want to rehearse too.

221
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,040
Run the scene with me.

222
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,280
Hey.

223
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,080
Do you remember...

224
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,560
that night you helped me memorize lines?

225
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,520
That metaphor is so corny.

226
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,360
Eyelids getting heavy.

227
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,720
Uh, eyelids fighting sleep.

228
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,559
You're talking about when you
knew the scene would get cut.

229
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:40,960
But still watched me perform it all night.

230
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,120
That's not what I meant.

231
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,600
Alright, are we ready? Let's go.

232
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,200
How accurate.

233
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,200
Legs like lead weights.

234
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:55,840
Eyelids at war.

235
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,280
Heart in my throat.
Got it.

236
00:11:59,080 --> 00:11:59,560
I know.

237
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,280
Let's start when you're ready.

238
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,000
Alright, let's get set

239
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,000
3
2

240
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
1

241
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,200
Action.

242
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:16,760
Legs like lead weights.

243
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,400
Eyelids at war.

244
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:20,760
Heart in my throat.

245
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:21,800
Got it.

246
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,440
I understand.

247
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,200
I get it now.

248
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:29,680
What exactly do you know.

249
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:30,840
What have you figured out.

250
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,840
I can sense.

251
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,520
Something's happening.

252
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,640
Something's unfolding.

253
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,600
I feel it too.

254
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:45,960
Really.

255
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,080
But I want to tell.
Cut! Cut.

256
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,600
Your line delivery feels off.

257
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,240
Where's the ADR.

258
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,600
Sorry, director.

259
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,040
Another take.

260
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,680
No problem.

261
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,976
Take your time to get into character.

262
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Alright.

263
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:04,120
Okay.
Come on

264
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,999
3

265
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,079
2

266
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,080
1

267
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:09,760
Action.

268
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,080
Legs like concrete blocks.

269
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,600
Eyelids weighing tons.

270
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,160
Heart pounding in my neck.

271
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:16,920
There.

272
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,400
I see now.

273
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,600
I finally get it.

274
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,960
What revelation have you had.

275
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,760
I can perceive.

276
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,360
Something shifting.

277
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:41,800
Has it already begun.

278
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,280
What's wrong with you.

279
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,120
These lines are too colloquial

280
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,880
I keep thinking we're just chatting.

281
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Alright, no worries.

282
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,479
Let's tackle the simpler scene first

283
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,599
I'll locate the clip.

284
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,000
Everyone take five.

285
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,360
Okay.

286
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,200
Going for a smoke.

287
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,280
Go by yourself.

288
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:14,560
Help me get in the zone.

289
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,640
Let's go.

290
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,400
Moving out.

291
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,440
That Director Fang.

292
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:31,240
Hmm, looks like we'll be
working pretty late today.

293
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,976
Maybe you should go handle
your other business first.

294
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:33,840
It's fine

295
00:14:33,841 --> 00:14:35,481
I came here specifically to oversee this.

296
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:37,760
Alright.

297
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,480
Not even a word of thanks.

298
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Thank you, Mr. Pei.

299
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I know.

300
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,440
Nothing I say right now
will get through to you.

301
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,719
But there's one thing.

302
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,080
You must listen to me about.

303
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:25,960
Mr. Pei.

304
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,080
After I finish dubbing today

305
00:15:28,081 --> 00:15:29,560
I have to rush back to work tonight.

306
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,840
Let's talk about anything
else after the session.

307
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,200
Do you know what Fang Runzhi really does?

308
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,600
Investor.

309
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,600
Your boss.

310
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
What about him.

311
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,120
It's not as simple as you think.

312
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,040
In short.

313
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,760
Whatever Fang Runzhi tells you.

314
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,160
Keep your guard up.

315
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:53,840
Then report back to me.

316
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,280
I need to go.

317
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,400
Actually.

318
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,280
I never thought people like
us could become friends.

319
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:08,760
But since we are friends

320
00:16:08,761 --> 00:16:10,361
I never intended to be friends with you.

321
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,480
Why are you acting like a child.

322
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,120
Why so stubborn.

323
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,640
Who's the real child here.

324
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,920
I said, who's the real child here.

325
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,560
And who's been avoiding me all these days.

326
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,080
No one asked you to look for me.

327
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,280
Cut.

328
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,640
Who told you to prompt him.

329
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:30,920
If you can film, film.

330
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:31,960
If not, get the hell out.

331
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:34,840
Actually.

332
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:37,560
I never thought people like
us could become friends.

333
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:42,800
Here we go again.

334
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:43,840
But since we are friends

335
00:16:43,841 --> 00:16:45,239
I never intended to be friends with you.

336
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,599
Can you stop acting like a child.

337
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,440
Why so stubborn.

338
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,680
Who's the real child here.

339
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,840
I said, who's the real child here.

340
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,080
You've been avoiding me for days.

341
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,320
No one forced you to find me.

342
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,600
I said no one forced you.

343
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,720
Damn it.

344
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,000
You messed up the lines again.

345
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,440
S-sorry, Director.

346
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:16,240
I

347
00:17:16,241 --> 00:17:17,760
I just asked you to dub a few lines.

348
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:18,720
This should take an afternoon.

349
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,200
How long do you need to drag it out.

350
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:21,200
This is pointless.
Director.

351
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:24,000
No one can afford to waste time with you.

352
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,159
Do you know how much footage
is waiting in the editing room?

353
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:26,760
Do you.
Because of you.

354
00:17:27,681 --> 00:17:29,360
Everyone's stuck here wasting time.

355
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,936
Do you have Pei Jia's looks or credentials.

356
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,039
Or Mr. Fang's resources.

357
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:33,840
Let me tell you.
You have nothing.

358
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,920
You're nobody.

359
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,839
I don't care how you
feel about this project

360
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,120
I don't care about your
past or current ambitions.

361
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,999
All I need now is for you.

362
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,656
To obediently help me
finish this damn production.

363
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,999
Director Yi, calm down.

364
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Please don't be angry.

365
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,400
They're a rookie.

366
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,256
First time in a recording studio.

367
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,400
This is my fault

368
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,720
I suddenly arranged for
them to join the dubbing.

369
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:54,920
My bad, my bad.

370
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:55,760
Oh, Mr. Fang

371
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,160
I wasn't targeting you.

372
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,600
It's fine. Artists have tempers sometimes.

373
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,160
Well, how about this.

374
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,520
Let's call it a day.

375
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,399
But Mr. Fang, we're
halfway through the session.

376
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,400
Won't take much longer.

377
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,160
Fine.

378
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,680
Then we'll end here today.

379
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,240
Alright, let's wrap up for today.

380
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:23,880
Xiao Su.

381
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Stay behind.

382
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,200
Need to talk with you.

383
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:27,600
Okay.

384
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:33,560
I'll head out first.

385
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:38,760
Xiao Su.

386
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,920
Last time I saw you was on set.

387
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,520
Not bad. You've improved a lot.

388
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,080
Thank you, Mr. Fang.

389
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,440
Being an actor isn't easy, is it.

390
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:50,880
No, it's not.

391
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,240
But I'll keep working harder.

392
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:56,040
I really admire diligent juniors like you.

393
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,240
Hey, what about that matter we discussed.

394
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,799
About signing with my agency.

395
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,560
You'd become Teacher
Pei's junior colleague.

396
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,560
I

397
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,200
I need to improve more

398
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,440
I'm serious.

399
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,800
I drafted the contract
while you were dubbing.

400
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,520
Review it carefully when you get back.

401
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,320
No clauses are against your interests.

402
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,040
Oh.

403
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,280
Take a look.

404
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:29,840
Hmm.

405
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,200
Sign with me.

406
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,760
How dare they criticize you.

407
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:00,680
I have another schedule

408
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:01,760
I need to go.

409
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,400
You don't have to work this hard, really.

410
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,240
Thank you, Brother Fang

411
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,600
I'm still young.

412
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,920
A little hardship is nothing.

413
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,640
Are you rejecting me again?

414
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:26,840
Millions of fans' eyes are on me.

415
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,040
After what happened before.

416
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,520
I'm not considering relationships anymore.

417
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,560
No one would know.

418
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,080
Even if they did.

419
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,280
I'd handle it.

420
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Thank you, Brother Fang.

421
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,640
Is there someone you like.

422
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,880
Thank you, Brother Fang.

423
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,200
More female fans.

424
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,440
Brother Fang.

425
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:58,880
You've been kind to me

426
00:20:58,881 --> 00:20:59,920
I haven't forgotten.

427
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,920
But I don't want to cause
any trouble for the agency.

428
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,120
Yiyi is waiting

429
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,160
I should go.

430
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,200
What are you doing here.

431
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,879
Nothing.

432
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:15,880
Just resting.

433
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,360
Were you waiting for me.

434
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,640
Nothing happened inside, right.

435
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,160
What could happen.

436
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,160
Su Yi.

437
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,160
Don't sign with him.

438
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,200
I'll think it through.

439
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,280
Heading back now
