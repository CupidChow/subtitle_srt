00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:52,420
(Episode 12)

4
00:00:58,440 --> 00:00:59,440
Give it to me.

5
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:04,280
Though I can't get you,

6
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:06,160
I'd take your pet.

7
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:07,960
I'll kill you!

8
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,040
Pei Jia! Pei Jia!

9
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,320
He just admitted it.

10
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:12,200
He did.
Calm down.

11
00:01:12,601 --> 00:01:13,920
Admitted? Admitted what?

12
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,320
Didn't you say he sucked at acting

13
00:01:15,321 --> 00:01:16,399
and asked me to teach him a lesson?

14
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,400
Right?

15
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,560
What's wrong?

16
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,440
I was so stupid.

17
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,439
How could I not guess

18
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:34,600
he'd turn off all the equipment
the second he arrived?

19
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,440
Want to listen to music?

20
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,120
No.

21
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,520
I always listen to this
song when I'm upset.

22
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,240
I said no. Go ahead.

23
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,320
Come on.

24
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,680
Took a lot of drugs

25
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,799
to get him in bed.

26
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,400
Though I can't get you,

27
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,240
I'd take your pet.

28
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,560
This...

29
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,720
Didn't he just take it off?

30
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,000
No one wears two mic bugs.

31
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,200
And no one
searches

32
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,160
for a second one either.

33
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,119
Hide the backup mic in his clothes.

34
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,239
Don't let other know.

35
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,400
Not even the actor himself.

36
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,600
Shen's entourage is intense.

37
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,920
Three assistants just for a mic.

38
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,239
Don't worry, Mr. Pei,

39
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,640
you'll be wearing one too.

40
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,359
Make sure it's secure,

41
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,120
so we get clean audio.

42
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Action.

43
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,040
Wait.

44
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,440
Second mic is on.

45
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,199
Director, per your request,

46
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,760
we've been recording the whole time.

47
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,999
Director, can you hear me?

48
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I'm here.

49
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,359
As Fang Runzhi found one,

50
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,760
now he thinks he's safe.

51
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,080
You're amazing, bro.

52
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,160
On behalf of Su, I thank you.

53
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,960
We're ready for the next step.

54
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:31,360
Hello everyone,

55
00:03:31,361 --> 00:03:33,519
my new film is about to air.

56
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,440
You've all been waiting?
In one week,

57
00:03:35,201 --> 00:03:36,239
we'll hold

58
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,440
an online press conference.

59
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,720
Don't miss it!

60
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,360
I've got a secret surprise.

61
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,280
Everyone watching will be first to know.

62
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,720
Great show's about to start.

63
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:46,960
See you soon!

64
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,159
I've got a secret surprise.

65
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,800
Everyone watching will be first to know.

66
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,240
Great show's about to start.

67
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,520
See you soon!

68
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,020
Jia, what's the surprise?

69
00:04:06,021 --> 00:04:07,879
(15 days before the press conference)
Jia, what's the surprise?

70
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,600
It's a secret, don't ask.

71
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,279
Even I can't know it?

72
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,560
Company planned it?

73
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,800
Don't ask that much.

74
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:20,380
(10 days before the press conference)

75
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,439
We're trending

76
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,040
with just the teaser.

77
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,919
Imagine how many people will watch it.

78
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,480
Got it, keep spreading the word.

79
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,160
Great show's about to start.

80
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:36,880
What's wrong, babe?

81
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,360
Had a nightmare?

82
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,440
I dreamed of him again.

83
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,600
Soon I'll finish him off for good.

84
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,079
Then every night after,

85
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,440
you'll sleep in peace.

86
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:51,080
Now every time I close
my eyes, it's full of color.

87
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,279
But when I open them,

88
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,560
it's all black.

89
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,880
It'll get better.

90
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,560
Everything will get better.

91
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:02,140
(8 days before the press conference)

92
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:16,340
(7 days before the press conference)

93
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:20,220
(6 days before the press conference)

94
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,040
Just hang on a little longer.

95
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,520
We'll see each other soon.

96
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,200
I miss you so much.

97
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,320
I really want to see you.

98
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,220
(5 days before the press conference)

99
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:38,920
Hi everyone, I'm Director Yi Wei.

100
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,519
For the press conference,

101
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:43,520
please get all audio and
streaming gear ready.

102
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,120
See you in five days.

103
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:58,260
Fang Runzhi's talk (Confidential)

104
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:09,820
(3 days before the press conference)

105
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:13,640
Bai.

106
00:06:13,641 --> 00:06:15,720
Is Pei Jia really burning all his bridges?

107
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:20,760
Mr. Yi,

108
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,400
Mr. Fang's next project starts soon.

109
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,560
Your pay's gonna go up for sure.

110
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,200
Thanks. But I need a break.

111
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:31,620
(2 days before the press conference)

112
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:32,880
Pei Jia,

113
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,679
maybe think twice

114
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,040
about the press conference?

115
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,639
Babe.

116
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,359
We'll surely make it.

117
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,879
But I don't want to do it anymore.

118
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,720
I don't want everyone knowing my story.

119
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,560
I want to forget it all

120
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,240
and start fresh with you.

121
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,639
Babe, I know you're upset right now.

122
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,560
But

123
00:06:54,561 --> 00:06:56,960
everything's already in place.

124
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:58,880
Yi Wei even said

125
00:06:58,881 --> 00:07:00,640
he's willing to quit directing forever.

126
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,960
This isn't just about you and me.

127
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,439
I don't want you living with that shame.

128
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,800
It's my shame to carry.

129
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:17,500
(1 days before the press conference)

130
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:19,680
So?

131
00:07:19,681 --> 00:07:20,719
Gave him a sedative.

132
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,840
He's asleep.

133
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,920
What did you say this time?

134
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,960
He said he didn't want
the press conference.

135
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,720
And you?

136
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,320
What did you say?

137
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,160
I...

138
00:07:32,161 --> 00:07:33,920
I tried to persuade him.

139
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,880
Let me guess.

140
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:38,920
Did you tell him

141
00:07:38,921 --> 00:07:40,520
that he's not alone?

142
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,359
And you told him

143
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,280
that everyone's been working hard,

144
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,559
Yi Wei was ready to give up the whole film

145
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,800
and his brother cleared his schedule?

146
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,560
If he wants to cancel, let him.

147
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,480
If you still love him.

148
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:04,920
What are you saying?

149
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,279
If I didn't love him,

150
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:08,760
why would I go through all this?

151
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,440
As long as Fang Runzhi's not exposed,

152
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,679
we'll keep living in fear

153
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,039
of more photos.

154
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,920
How many more days
like that can you survive?

155
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,520
Pei Jia,

156
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,040
tolerate his fear.

157
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,840
Thanks for coming.

158
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,320
I don't even know

159
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,720
how our film

160
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,240
become like this.

161
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,840
It was like a dream.

162
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:58,800
Yeah, like a dream.

163
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,959
We worked so hard to get that recording,

164
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:01,960
and now it...

165
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:10,880
I'm worried.

166
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,000
What if something goes wrong?

167
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,000
But it's canceled.

168
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,320
The predator

169
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,120
becomes a guest speaker?

170
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,160
Honestly, it's good if the
audio doesn't get played.

171
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,359
Or Su Yi and Pei Jia

172
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,880
may never have peace.

173
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:29,760
Yeah…

174
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,160
Maybe.

175
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,160
Thanks for coming, everyone.

176
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,559
Thank you

177
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,960
for supporting this show.

178
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:51,760
Pei Jia! Pei Jia!

179
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,199
We know who you're all here to see.

180
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,239
Let's welcome our two leads:

181
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,000
Pei Jia and Shen Xing!

182
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,680
Pei Jia! Pei Jia!

183
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,920
Pei Jia, over here!

184
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,960
Hi, I'm Shen Xing.

185
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,359
Pei Jia.

186
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,880
If you still care about Su Yi,

187
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,560
don't count on him showing up

188
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,240
to bear the suffering.

189
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,320
Please tell Yi Wei

190
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,640
that we will bear it

191
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,200
and finish the press
conference with Fang Runzhi.

192
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,880
Hi everyone, I'm Pei Jia.

193
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:45,599
You all know Pei Jia well.

194
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,239
Let me introduce

195
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,240
a new face,

196
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:51,880
Shen Xing.

197
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:58,620
This is Braille.
(One hour ago)
This is Braille.

198
00:10:59,441 --> 00:11:03,400
It's read by feeling raised
dots with your fingers.

199
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,120
In simplified Braille,

200
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,720
some tones can be skipped.

201
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,799
The vowel "a"

202
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,440
is dot 3 and 5

203
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:15,120
to express the rising tone.

204
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,200
For example,

205
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,040
to write "8"...

206
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,399
This is your letter.

207
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,400
A dot...

208
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,496
Just leave it on the table.

209
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,520
A dot

210
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,880
on the third row

211
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,159
and two dots on the forth row.

212
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,000
Hello everyone,

213
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,760
I'm a new actor, Shen Xing.

214
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,399
He's a rookie we just signed.

215
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,800
Though he doesn't have much experience,

216
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,519
he impressed the team

217
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,600
and got the role.

218
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:44,680
Sorry,

219
00:11:44,681 --> 00:11:45,721
can I say something first?

220
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,079
Let me introduce

221
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,040
our writer and director:

222
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,960
Su Bai and Yi Wei.

223
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,400
Not your turn yet.

224
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,480
Not your turn yet.

225
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,199
Director，

226
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,440
say hi to the audience in back!

227
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:09,840
Hi everyone,

228
00:12:09,841 --> 00:12:11,680
I'm Yi Wei, the director.

229
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:19,919
I have to leave for a while.

230
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:20,920
Why?

231
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,600
To get the audio.

232
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:24,880
Time for fireworks.

233
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:39,760
Sorry,

234
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,360
I can't see.

235
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,920
Could you read this for me?

236
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,240
It's Braille.

237
00:12:44,241 --> 00:12:45,760
You may read it yourself.

238
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,440
It's a card, not a letter.

239
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,279
The sender is

240
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,280
Pei Jia.

241
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,200
He says

242
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,480
that if you don't

243
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,280
show up today,

244
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,480
he'll understand.

245
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,600
Mr. Fang is always promoting us.

246
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,599
But no one ever

247
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,280
promotes him well.

248
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,520
Let me take this chance

249
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:38,079
to introduce our hero

250
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,480
behind the stage,

251
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,120
which is Fang Runzhi!

252
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,040
When I

253
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,840
just signed,

254
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,560
I was at my lowest.

255
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:03,760
Then,

256
00:14:03,761 --> 00:14:05,320
Mr. Fang told me

257
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,280
that this is just the beginning.

258
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,599
After signing,

259
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,239
you will get

260
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,400
the real rock bottom.

261
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,200
I thought

262
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,880
Mr. Fang was so funny.

263
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,039
And this company is adorable

264
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,320
and charming.

265
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,240
So I signed the contract right away.

266
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,359
However,

267
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,360
afterwards,

268
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,400
it's proved that Mr. Fang

269
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,680
never jokes.

270
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,120
What?

271
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:49,920
Not funny?

272
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,360
Let me try again.

273
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,080
Oh!
Yes!

274
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:02,200
Mr. Fang's got a sharp eye.

275
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,160
As the manager.

276
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,080
Firstly,

277
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,759
he recruited me,

278
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,999
Pei Jia, a disgraced

279
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
actor.

280
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,680
Then he wore his glasses on

281
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:14,920
and spotted

282
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,679
the newbie

283
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,079
who has the lowest moral standard

284
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,720
in the showbiz,

285
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,400
Shen Xing.

286
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,720
I haven't finished talking yet.

287
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,479
Are you implying

288
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:36,000
Shen Xing and Fang
Runzhi have a relationship?

289
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,320
Mr. Fang,

290
00:15:37,321 --> 00:15:39,160
is there anything you want to say?

291
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:40,920
Here is the case.

292
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:43,559
We cast roles fairly.

293
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:46,040
I have no improper
relationship with Shen Xing.

294
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:49,239
Fang ignored the contracts
and swapped the lead

295
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,879
after filming was done.

296
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,879
Shen Xing never auditioned.

297
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,080
You forced him in.

298
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,680
Everyone on set knows.

299
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,039
As investor,

300
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,439
we have casting rights.

301
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,239
Pei Jia, you're slandering me.

302
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,880
Then what about that
late-night kiss on the street?

303
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,040
That's trending now.

304
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,719
Staying with me actor

305
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,159
is inappropriate?

306
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:17,560
Then

307
00:16:17,561 --> 00:16:20,040
what about me and you, Pei Jia?

308
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,880
I accuse Fang Runzhi...

309
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:45,760
Sweet...

310
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,160
Sweet Su,

311
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:58,480
To write this letter,

312
00:16:58,481 --> 00:17:00,600
I've been learning Braille every day.

313
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,720
It's actually a pretty
fascinating language.

314
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,160
Though I only got 50 Chinese
score on the college entrance exam,

315
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:08,360
I'm confident I can at
least get you started.

316
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:12,320
Do you remember that letter
you wrote me a year ago?

317
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,880
It was the same kind
of audio greeting card.

318
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:16,560
So hard to find now.

319
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,720
I searched for ages
before finally digging it up.

320
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,239
After you hung up the phone last time,

321
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,600
you never picked up again.

322
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,600
I wonder if you ever
went to see that movie.

323
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,719
I wish so much

324
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:30,520
that I could walk with you through
all the dark corners of this world:

325
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:33,919
every shadowy alley
that gives people chills,

326
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,720
every restless, silent room,

327
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,120
every quiet movie theater.

328
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,800
I want to go through all
the darkness in this world.

329
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,360
So maybe, just maybe, I
could begin to understand you.

330
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,800
I accuse Fang Runzhi

331
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,880
of using his position

332
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,400
to assault his actors.

333
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:06,199
Wow! Breaking news!

334
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,759
So intense!

335
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,359
Fang Runzhi had inappropriate

336
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:11,920
with several actors.

337
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,800
Some of them might've done it for profit,

338
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:16,799
and some

339
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,640
for a role, or an opportunity.

340
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:21,960
They were willing to let him do it.

341
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,480
But others

342
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:31,919
were coerced by Fang
Runzhi through illegal means

343
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,120
and raped by him.

344
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,720
You're just spreading
malicious lies. This is defamation!

345
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:45,120
Director.

346
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,000
Let the show begin.

347
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,560
Your dying little pet?

348
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,160
He's my lover.

349
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,039
Well, he's awfully disobedient.

350
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:06,960
I warned him

351
00:19:06,961 --> 00:19:08,440
not to contact you anymore.

352
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,440
How did you warn him?

353
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,080
You haven't seen those photos.

354
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,000
They're quite something.

355
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,520
Young and wild.

356
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:20,000
Su Yi's not like that.

357
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:23,439
Took a lot of drugs

358
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,880
to get him in bed.

359
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,439
Why did you do it?

360
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,240
Though I can't get you,

361
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,160
I'd take your pet.

362
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:31,560
I'll kill you!

363
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,719
Pei Jia! Pei Jia! Pei Jia!

364
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,000
He just admitted it.

365
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:35,840
He did.
Calm down.

366
00:19:36,241 --> 00:19:37,519
Admitted? Admitted what?

367
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,839
That I hit you?

368
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:41,159
Huh? Yi, didn't you say he sucked at acting

369
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,120
and asked me to teach him a lesson?
Right?

370
00:19:42,881 --> 00:19:44,919
Mr. Fang, please explain.

371
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,439
Is this true?

372
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,440
Wait.

373
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,680
That's your confession.

374
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,320
Don't forget.

375
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,079
We'll end the press conference here.

376
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:56,880
Later,

377
00:19:56,881 --> 00:19:58,800
an official statement will come.

378
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,840
Mr. Fang, wait.

379
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,960
Please wait.

380
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,839
What's going on?

381
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,079
Please explain!

382
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,080
Mr. Fang, please explain.

383
00:20:09,081 --> 00:20:10,559
What's going on?

384
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:11,000
Please explain.
Please wait.

385
00:20:11,761 --> 00:20:13,200
Please explain it now.

386
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:21,680
Who's person mentioned in the audio?

387
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:24,960
That's

388
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,680
our original lead,

389
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,440
Su Yi.

390
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,800
He's also an actor under Fang's management.

391
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,200
Because he disobeyed Fang Runzhi,

392
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,919
for the so called

393
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,839
"breach of contract"

394
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,000
Fang Runzhi fired him

395
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:51,440
and deleted all his scenes.

396
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,440
What's your relationship?

397
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:57,760
We're dating.

398
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,920
Oh my!

399
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:03,119
Was this just a PR stunt?

400
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:03,640
Don't you think

401
00:21:03,641 --> 00:21:04,879
this will

402
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,560
ruin your career?

403
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,839
I've decided

404
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,199
that from today on,

405
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,800
I'll stop all my work.

406
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,720
I'm leaving showbiz.

407
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,240
I know,

408
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,040
since my debut,

409
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,280
it's been scandal after scandal.

410
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:35,800
I admit

411
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:38,320
I wasn't

412
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:40,400
a good idol,

413
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,320
not even a good actor.

414
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:56,640
But now,

415
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,640
I want to be a good partner

416
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,400
to stay with my love.

417
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,240
Su Yi,

418
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:15,120
I chose not to air the audio,

419
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:19,480
and I quit forcing you to come out.

420
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:23,800
I was selfish.

421
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,000
Just because I was ready

422
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,600
doesn't mean you were

423
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,760
to expose your wound.

424
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,480
I'm sorry.

425
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,200
I love you.

426
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,600
I'd give up everything for you.

427
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:46,640
If one day

428
00:22:46,641 --> 00:22:48,880
you want to end this nightmare

429
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,040
to conquer your fear,

430
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:54,000
I'll stand beside you,

431
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,320
take every bullet for you.

432
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,520
You showed me love isn't a weapon

433
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,480
but armor.

434
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:23,840
My babe

435
00:23:23,841 --> 00:23:25,000
is ill now.

436
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:28,319
And for a long time to come,

437
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,080
I'll be by his side

438
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,480
to be with him.

439
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,999
Will we see

440
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,680
Pei Jia's scenes again?

441
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,199
Now we belong to each other.

442
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,200
Right?

443
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:27,320
Yes.

444
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:30,120
Finally, we belong to each other.
