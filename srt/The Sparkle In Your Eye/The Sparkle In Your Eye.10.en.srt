(Episode 10)

5
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,240
Jia.

6
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,640
Jia, are you home?

7
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:10,720
Jia, are you okay?

8
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:12,560
Oh my!

9
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:21,960
Jia,

10
00:01:21,961 --> 00:01:23,881
you've ignored all the
messages for a whole day.

11
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,000
You reek of alcohol.

12
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,120
Here,

13
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,320
drink some water.

14
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,480
Jia.

15
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,120
What happened?

16
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,319
Nothing.

17
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:40,880
Then why didn't you reply to messages?

18
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,600
I almost filed a missing person report.

19
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,320
My phone died.

20
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:49,920
Jia,

21
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,400
why didn't you drink so much?

22
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,280
Felt like it.

23
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,239
No one drinks that much

24
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,480
just because they feel like it.

25
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:58,880
Yiyi,

26
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,320
drink with me.

27
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:02,720
Jia,

28
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,440
are you sure you're okay?

29
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,240
Sure, I'm fine.

30
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,519
Is there any worries

31
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,840
or problems?

32
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,920
No, not at all.

33
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,840
Did Su Yi snatch your roles?

34
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:24,080
He's been getting close to Mr. Fang lately.

35
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,639
Tonight,

36
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,839
they even went

37
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,600
to that business event you turned down.

38
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,680
Look.

39
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,200
But don't worry.

40
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,199
He's not as good-looking

41
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,200
or talented as you.

42
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,040
He'll be forgotten soon.

43
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,280
Alright,

44
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,320
go home.

45
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,920
Cancel my schedule for now.

46
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:50,880
Got it.

47
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,200
Thanks.

48
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,720
This is Mr. Zhang.

49
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Mr. Zhang,

50
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,280
surprised you're bringing someone new out.

51
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,040
He's ready.

52
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,800
It's time to introduce him to you.

53
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,200
This is Su Yi.

54
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:14,920
Come on.

55
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,360
Mr. Zhang.

56
00:03:19,361 --> 00:03:21,880
I heard you used to be a bartender?

57
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,160
Yeah.

58
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,160
This is the bar where he used to work.

59
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,599
I booked it for tonight.

60
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,280
Can you mix me a drink?

61
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Mr. Zhang.

62
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,480
What would you like?

63
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,120
I'll go make it.

64
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,680
Something only you can make.

65
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,600
And something unique.

66
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,280
Why else would I bring you here?

67
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,480
Alright.

68
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,520
Cheers.

69
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,480
Didn't you say you'd come for a drink?

70
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,880
Why are you just staring at me?

71
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,480
Who even drinks absinthe?

72
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:43,160
This drink was named
by Pei Jia, the super star.

73
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,240
Maybe you'll be more
famous than me by then.

74
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,120
Why did you choose absinthe?

75
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:04,920
It's beautiful.

76
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,360
What's its name?

77
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,840
I haven't decided its name yet.

78
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,480
Let's call it Hallucination.

79
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,560
Give me a Hallucination.

80
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,600
Don't sign with the company.

81
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,040
Su Yi.

82
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,059
We hit it off.

83
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:34,060
Yeah.

84
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:30,760
Let me drive you home.
Mr. Fang,

85
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,480
I need to talk.

86
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:37,920
Go ahead.

87
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,800
If you want more resources,

88
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,360
tonight wasn't your best shot...

89
00:06:42,361 --> 00:06:43,481
I want an early termination.

90
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,520
I want to leave the company.

91
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,800
Haven't I treated you well?

92
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,640
What?

93
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:01,040
Now that you've got what
you want, you wang to leave?

94
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,920
I can't keep doing this.

95
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,800
Su Yi,

96
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,200
have you even read your contract?

97
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,479
Counted the zeroes on the penalty clause?

98
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,840
I'll pay it.

99
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,280
With what?

100
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,599
You think you'll still get roles

101
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,920
after leaving me?

102
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,080
You know what?
One phone call,

103
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:25,280
and every scene you've
ever shot will be reshot.

104
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,560
I made you,

105
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,280
and I can ruin you.

106
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,920
You okay?

107
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:17,840
Need help?

108
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:20,920
Hey…
Wake up!

109
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:22,840
Hey!

110
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,320
Doctor said that you felt dizzy

111
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,880
because of a mild concussion.

112
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,160
Just need a few weeks in the hospital.

113
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,560
Bai,

114
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:43,040
is that you?

115
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,360
I...

116
00:08:44,361 --> 00:08:45,600
I can't see.

117
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,800
Your vision...

118
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,840
It's the tumor pressing
on your optic nerve.

119
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,280
Well...

120
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,320
Did you know

121
00:09:00,321 --> 00:09:01,840
you would lose your vision long ago?

122
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,960
It's too close to the nerve.

123
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,960
Surgery is expensive

124
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,720
and risky.

125
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,159
So you just waited

126
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,160
and did nothing

127
00:09:15,161 --> 00:09:16,600
until you went blind?

128
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,200
Su Yi.

129
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,479
I kept this from your parents.

130
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,120
I thought you were just being rebellious.

131
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,320
I didn't think you were being reckless.

132
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,760
Bai.

133
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,559
I didn't want to trouble you.

134
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,520
Now you're more like trouble!

135
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:33,760
Su Yi.

136
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,200
The tumor is pressing on your optic nerve.

137
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:38,400
If this keeps up,

138
00:09:38,401 --> 00:09:40,200
you'll go blind permanently.

139
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,000
If the tumor spreads,

140
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,640
you may die.

141
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,840
Bai.

142
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,760
Have a good rest here.

143
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,040
I'll be here with you.

144
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,320
I'll talk to the doctor tomorrow.

145
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,840
Try to schedule surgery ASAP.

146
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,160
Bai.

147
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,480
What's that sound?

148
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:24,560
What? I said I'd try to
schedule surgery soon.

149
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:29,760
Don't worry.

150
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,320
Bai.

151
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:35,960
Keep it from Pei Jia.

152
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,680
Why?

153
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,320
I love him.

154
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,480
Even if I will never

155
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,360
see his face

156
00:10:58,361 --> 00:11:00,520
when he hears me say it...

157
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:06,960
Fang Runzhi said

158
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,480
if I tell him about that matter,

159
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,120
he will destroy Pei Jia.

160
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,880
When were you planning to tell me then?

161
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,400
Don't cry.

162
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,400
It's not your fault.

163
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,920
Su Yi, I'm sorry.

164
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,680
I've always known what
kind of person Fang Runzhi is.

165
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,720
I just never told you.

166
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,600
When I first joined the company,

167
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,120
he harassed me too.

168
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,600
I should've warned you.

169
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,360
It's my fault!

170
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,280
Stop it.

171
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,160
On the day of the signing,

172
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,560
you vanished.

173
00:12:57,561 --> 00:12:58,679
I looked everywhere for you.

174
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,919
I kept looking for you...

175
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:01,920
But...

176
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,360
I couldn't find you.

177
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,000
If I had,

178
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,480
would everything be different?

179
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,560
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

180
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,160
He took pictures of us.

181
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,200
If I told you,

182
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,400
he'd leak them.

183
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,280
I was scared.

184
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,279
Then let him do it.

185
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,039
I'll testify for you.

186
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,439
But then you'd lose your acting career.

187
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,479
I don't care.

188
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,999
I do.

189
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,359
I don't want you to suffer again

190
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,440
over one photo.

191
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,480
I don't matter.

192
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,240
You matter more than the world.

193
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,480
Su Yi,

194
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,560
let me ask you one more time.

195
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,480
I love you.

196
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,080
Will you be my boyfriend?

197
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,880
Can I get an answer?

198
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,280
No.

199
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,000
I'm blind and...

200
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,520
I...

201
00:14:54,521 --> 00:14:55,760
That's okay.

202
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:57,800
Like I said,

203
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,080
no matter how far you fall,

204
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,800
I'll catch you.

205
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,920
I'm scared if I say yes,

206
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:13,960
I'll just end up being one of many...

207
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,240
Not the most important.

208
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:17,840
Not the best.

209
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,680
What I did before was wrong.

210
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:25,360
I didn't know what I wanted.

211
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:30,680
So I kept searching.

212
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:33,920
But when I met you,

213
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,600
I knew.

214
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,360
Thank you,

215
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:52,800
Pei Jia.

216
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:55,760
Thank you.

217
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,560
Thank you.

218
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,840
I won't let Fang Runzhi get away with it.

219
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,720
I want to leave the company.

220
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,480
I made you

221
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:41,200
and I can ruin you.

222
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,400
Hi.

223
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,120
Here is the thing.

224
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,440
Replace Su Yi in Yi Wei's crew.

225
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,560
Hello, Director Yi Wei.

226
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:09,920
Hello, who's speaking?

227
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,280
Company legal team.

228
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,479
Unfortunately, due to breach of contract,

229
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,239
all of Su Yi's scenes

230
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,320
will need to be reshot.

231
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:19,360
Fang Runzhi.

232
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,840
Why are you replacing Su Yi?

233
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:22,400
Hello, Director Yi.
Take a seat.

234
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,680
Here is the thing,

235
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,720
Su Yi broke the contract.

236
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,280
I can't have a contract
violator in our productions.

237
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,080
What clause did he break?

238
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:41,920
Do I have to tell you?

239
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,080
Anyway, every shot of
his needs to be reshot.

240
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:50,360
I'll cover the costs.

241
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,479
This isn't just about money.

242
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,679
Replacing him

243
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,760
means I have to reshoot half the series!

244
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:57,920
Fang Runzhi, you know what,

245
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,040
I quit!

246
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,880
Su Yi's in the hospital!

247
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,520
Are you still a man or not?

248
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:03,800
Hospital?

249
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:04,920
Which one?
I'll go visit him.

250
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,080
You want to know?

251
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,800
Fine.

252
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,960
I wonder if you still
have the guts to face him.

253
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:17,920
Hello?

254
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,320
Which hospital is Su Yi in?

255
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:20,840
Where are you?

256
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,520
In Fang Runzhi's office.

257
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:23,760
He just said...

258
00:18:23,761 --> 00:18:25,200
He wants a reshoot? Fine.

259
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:26,960
Don't say anything. Just agree.

260
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,360
What?

261
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,759
Just do it.

262
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,520
I'll explain in person.

263
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,639
Do you know what you're talking about?

264
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,880
Yi Wei, just do it.

265
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:37,920
You said

266
00:18:37,921 --> 00:18:39,160
you'd always be on my side.

267
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:49,840
Which hospital?

268
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,560
I'll call the driver.

269
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:57,920
Mr. Fang,

270
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,880
there must be some misunderstanding.

271
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,600
It's indeed Su Yi's problem.

272
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,919
Incredible. Who did you call?

273
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,559
I go from

274
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:10,080
Fang Ruizhi to Mr. Fang again.

275
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,200
Sorry, Mr. Fang.

276
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,400
I overreacted.

277
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,320
Forget the actor,

278
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,640
I almost hired a new director just now.

279
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:23,080
We've got a reshoot meeting tonight.

280
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,040
If you are available,

281
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,000
please be there.

282
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:33,840
Easy.
How is he?

283
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,200
Su Yi's blind.

284
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,120
Don't joke.

285
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,040
I'd never joke about my brother.

286
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,400
He hid it from us.

287
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,720
Alright.

288
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:51,880
Pei Jia's here too?

289
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,560
He has something to say.

290
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,080
He has a plan.

291
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,320
What plan?

292
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,640
That's the second
thing we need to tell you.

293
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,600
Hi, Yi Wei,

294
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:54,720
listen.

295
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
We're taking on Fang Runzhi directly.

296
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,720
I've been by his side a long time.

297
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,799
I know he's prudent.

298
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,080
He never slips up.

299
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,640
So, what we can do now

300
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:08,200
is to stay by his side loyally.

301
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,080
What about the others?

302
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,680
What do we do now?

303
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:39,680
We wait.

304
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,120
Come on.

305
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:11,040
Let's welcome our new cast member.
