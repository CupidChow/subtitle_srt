(Episode 11)

5
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:57,500
The doctor said

6
00:00:58,033 --> 00:01:00,333
once they remove the tumor, it'll be fine.

7
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:02,500
Yeah.

8
00:01:04,633 --> 00:01:06,700
Not sure if Pei Jia's method will work.

9
00:01:09,266 --> 00:01:11,265
He knows Fang Runzhi.

10
00:01:11,266 --> 00:01:12,500
And Yi Wei's helping too.

11
00:01:13,466 --> 00:01:14,466
It'll be fine.

12
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,433
Alright.

13
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,666
I'm a little worried about him.

14
00:01:25,133 --> 00:01:26,166
Thank you, Mr. Shen.

15
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:26,466
Wow!

16
00:01:26,467 --> 00:01:27,700
Thanks, Mr. Shen.

17
00:01:29,733 --> 00:01:30,966
Thank you, Mr. Shen Xing.

18
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:33,433
Thank you.

19
00:01:33,466 --> 00:01:34,466
Thanks.
Thank you.

20
00:01:35,101 --> 00:01:36,299
Thanks.

21
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:36,933
Thank you.

22
00:01:36,934 --> 00:01:39,166
Thanks.

23
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,699
- Thanks. - Thanks.

24
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:42,800
Thanks.

25
00:01:50,133 --> 00:01:51,133
Mr. Pei.

26
00:01:57,133 --> 00:01:58,566
We're about the same age.

27
00:01:59,233 --> 00:02:00,866
You may just call my name.

28
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:03,900
You are my senior.

29
00:02:04,133 --> 00:02:05,333
So, I should respect you.

30
00:02:06,233 --> 00:02:07,233
Mr. Pei,

31
00:02:12,033 --> 00:02:13,033
this is for you.

32
00:02:13,233 --> 00:02:14,533
Heard you like 30% sugar.

33
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:15,980
This is especially for you.

34
00:02:17,533 --> 00:02:18,533
Sorry,

35
00:02:18,833 --> 00:02:21,500
I'm watching my weight. Can't have it.

36
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,000
You look great already.

37
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:27,233
You'll lose your charm
if you lose more weight.

38
00:02:27,266 --> 00:02:30,100
Really? I still feel like I
should lose a bit more.

39
00:02:32,066 --> 00:02:33,566
Or I'll look top-heavy.

40
00:02:37,266 --> 00:02:40,166
Let your assistant hold it then.

41
00:02:40,466 --> 00:02:42,866
No need. Give it to someone else.

42
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:59,500
I gotta go get my hair done.

43
00:03:02,633 --> 00:03:05,333
Aren't we filming together later?

44
00:03:07,033 --> 00:03:08,500
Don't let the milk tea

45
00:03:08,866 --> 00:03:10,133
delay our shoot.

46
00:03:14,866 --> 00:03:16,100
Thanks for the reminder.

47
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:24,766
Alright, pick up the pace!

48
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,800
Let's go, fast.

49
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,766
Ready on set?

50
00:03:27,933 --> 00:03:29,000
- Good. - Good.

51
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:29,733
Okay.

1

53
00:03:31,866 --> 00:03:32,866
Action.

54
00:03:40,266 --> 00:03:41,266
Let me hold it.

55
00:03:45,066 --> 00:03:45,866
Jia,

56
00:03:45,933 --> 00:03:47,732
it seems that you become
grumpy easily lately.

57
00:03:47,733 --> 00:03:48,733
Cut!

58
00:03:49,533 --> 00:03:50,533
Passed!

59
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,433
Well,

60
00:03:53,033 --> 00:03:55,266
what's Shen Xing's background?

61
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,600
No idea.

62
00:03:58,266 --> 00:03:59,266
Well,

63
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,533
he doesn't seem to have many works.

64
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,833
But Mr. Fang seems to be backing him.

65
00:04:06,833 --> 00:04:08,313
Did you make an appointment with Fang

66
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:09,733
as I told you yesterday?

67
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,433
He's been super busy.

68
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:16,433
He hasn't even shown
up to company meetings.

69
00:04:19,933 --> 00:04:21,066
Think of a way then.

70
00:04:22,133 --> 00:04:23,133
Alright.

71
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,833
Why, what do you need to discuss?

72
00:04:31,133 --> 00:04:31,600
Alright, again.

73
00:04:31,633 --> 00:04:32,633
One more time.

74
00:04:33,666 --> 00:04:34,666
Action.

75
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,200
I just want to hold on to
you for one last second.

76
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:40,100
Hey,

77
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,500
well,

78
00:04:41,501 --> 00:04:43,000
if you are not my assistant anymore,

79
00:04:43,666 --> 00:04:44,733
what would you want to do?

80
00:04:45,033 --> 00:04:46,433
Why are you asking that?

81
00:04:47,433 --> 00:04:48,900
Just answer.

82
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,600
I never thought about it.

83
00:04:53,066 --> 00:04:55,566
Are you planning to dump me?

84
00:04:57,833 --> 00:04:58,833
Come on!

85
00:04:59,133 --> 00:05:00,200
Of course not.

86
00:05:01,033 --> 00:05:02,033
Good then.

87
00:05:02,466 --> 00:05:03,699
Someone

88
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:07,133
who can deal with your
temper isn't easy to find.

89
00:05:09,933 --> 00:05:12,066
If one day I quit…

90
00:05:13,266 --> 00:05:14,800
You mean quit acting?

91
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,133
More or less.

92
00:05:17,266 --> 00:05:19,866
If you're thinking of going
back to being an idol,

93
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,433
you might be a bit old.

94
00:05:21,533 --> 00:05:23,066
But switching to livestream sales...

95
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:24,433
Maybe there's still hope.

96
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:30,200
No matter what,

97
00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:32,333
you'll still need an assistant, right?

98
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:33,900
Cut!

99
00:05:46,666 --> 00:05:47,866
Quiet on set!

100
00:05:48,233 --> 00:05:49,066

2

101
00:05:50,033 --> 00:05:50,833
1
Action.

102
00:06:04,266 --> 00:06:05,266
Cut.

103
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,132
Pei Jia,

104
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:08,200
mind your eye contact.

105
00:06:08,233 --> 00:06:08,733
Adjust your emotion.

106
00:06:08,734 --> 00:06:10,133
One more time.

107
00:06:11,466 --> 00:06:12,532
Quiet on set!

108
00:06:12,533 --> 00:06:13,633

109
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:14,865

110
00:06:14,866 --> 00:06:15,866
1

111
00:06:16,666 --> 00:06:17,666
Action.

112
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:26,500
Cut.

113
00:06:26,733 --> 00:06:27,766
What are you doing?

114
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,800
Pei Jia!

115
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:30,732
Is this how you felt when you first

116
00:06:30,733 --> 00:06:32,600
got with your partner? Try again.

117
00:06:35,066 --> 00:06:36,300
Alright, action!

118
00:06:50,266 --> 00:06:51,266
Cut!

119
00:06:52,133 --> 00:06:53,366
Pei Jia, what are you doing?

120
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,533
Did you use a stand-in
for this scene last time?

121
00:06:56,133 --> 00:06:56,933
What's going on?

122
00:06:57,133 --> 00:06:58,600
I'm just not in the mood today.

123
00:06:58,633 --> 00:06:59,433
Not in the mood?
And you're

124
00:07:00,201 --> 00:07:01,866
wasting everyone's time?

125
00:07:02,033 --> 00:07:03,500
I don't have time to waste.

126
00:07:04,266 --> 00:07:05,266
Let's do it again.

127
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,400
This one's gotta work.

128
00:07:06,833 --> 00:07:07,333
Okay.

129
00:07:07,466 --> 00:07:08,533
Just imagine

130
00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:11,233
what it felt like when
you first got with Su Yi

131
00:07:11,433 --> 00:07:12,633
and what it felt like

132
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,566
when you kissed him for the first time.

133
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:16,700
Okay?

134
00:07:16,733 --> 00:07:17,066
Okay.

135
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,100
Imagine that.

136
00:07:18,433 --> 00:07:19,533
Everyone quiet!

137
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:24,133
Okay!
Quiet on set!

138
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:26,100
Clear the space

139
00:07:26,101 --> 00:07:27,366
for the actors.

140
00:07:33,466 --> 00:07:34,466
3

141
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:36,900
2

142
00:07:38,933 --> 00:07:39,933
1

143
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,200
Action.

144
00:08:27,066 --> 00:08:28,266
Pei Jia, what are you doing?

145
00:08:28,433 --> 00:08:29,633
Cut, cut, cut!

146
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,099
What's wrong?

147
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,033
You were doing fine.
Why did you stop?

148
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:38,900
Why did you get up?

149
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:40,900
What's wrong?
Homophobic?

150
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,400
Germaphobic?

151
00:08:43,533 --> 00:08:44,693
You weren't like this before.

152
00:08:45,933 --> 00:08:46,933
Sorry, Director.

153
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,033
We're moving the camera.
Let's go.

154
00:08:50,733 --> 00:08:51,733
Come on!

155
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,600
We'll shoot Shen Xing's scenes first.

156
00:08:55,133 --> 00:08:56,566
You, get out of the way.

157
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,499
Tonight I'll bring Fang Runzhi here

158
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:00,433
and show him the footage.

159
00:09:00,466 --> 00:09:02,026
See what kind of crap you're giving us.

160
00:09:02,233 --> 00:09:03,233
Everyone!

161
00:09:03,234 --> 00:09:04,832
What else are

162
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:05,833
Shen Xing's scenes?

163
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,433
Let's finish his scenes today.

164
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:10,966
What the hell am I filming?

165
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,633
Zero chemistry.

166
00:09:13,233 --> 00:09:14,233
I'm done.

167
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,265
Makeup!

168
00:09:21,266 --> 00:09:21,900
Fix him up!

169
00:09:21,901 --> 00:09:23,366
Go touch up!

170
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:34,800
Felt good yelling, huh?

171
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,520
First time yelling at a big star.

172
00:09:39,633 --> 00:09:40,633
Feels great.

173
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:43,566
You don't look like an actor.

174
00:09:45,866 --> 00:09:46,866
Then, will Shen Xing

175
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:48,200
believe it?

176
00:09:48,233 --> 00:09:49,465
Pretty much what we expected.

177
00:09:49,466 --> 00:09:50,466
Step by step.

178
00:09:50,533 --> 00:09:52,013
Right after the shoot, he came to me.

179
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,709
Said he wants to spend the night with you.

180
00:09:53,733 --> 00:09:54,733
Ha.

181
00:09:54,866 --> 00:09:56,026
Says it's to build chemistry.

182
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:00,033
It's the only way to expose him.

183
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,500
Fang Runzhi's premiere is coming.

184
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:05,100
We need to hurry.

185
00:10:09,033 --> 00:10:10,033
Are you sure?

186
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,040
Really quitting the movie?

187
00:10:13,933 --> 00:10:16,066
Yeah.

188
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,200
Just like Su Bai said,

189
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,000
if this is what it takes
to make a good film,

190
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,500
then don't make it.

191
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:34,800
Left foot.

192
00:10:35,133 --> 00:10:36,133
Okay, this way.

193
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:42,066
Go left.
A bit more.

194
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,600
Okay.

195
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:46,333
Sit down.

196
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:52,600
It's okay, take your time. No rush.

197
00:10:54,133 --> 00:10:54,600
Okay.

198
00:10:54,633 --> 00:10:57,900
I didn't think even something
so small would need help now.

199
00:11:02,933 --> 00:11:04,400
What's it like being blind?

200
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:08,265
Haha.

201
00:11:08,266 --> 00:11:09,966
Good...

202
00:11:10,733 --> 00:11:12,733
Trying to use me for material again?

203
00:11:12,933 --> 00:11:13,933
Really?

204
00:11:14,066 --> 00:11:15,332
Just chatting.

205
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:17,666
Feels better than bottling it up.

206
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:20,333
Fine.

207
00:11:21,533 --> 00:11:22,033
Let's chat.

208
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:23,300
Okay.

209
00:11:24,133 --> 00:11:25,466
Well...

210
00:11:28,133 --> 00:11:29,866
Last night, when you turned off

211
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:31,833
the light,

212
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:36,566
do you know how secure that click

213
00:11:37,666 --> 00:11:40,066
made me feel?

214
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:41,666
I was thinking...

215
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,400
Great!

216
00:11:44,033 --> 00:11:45,233
I become like you guys again!

217
00:11:45,866 --> 00:11:47,333
Haha.

218
00:11:47,933 --> 00:11:50,400
So your hearing got better?

219
00:11:52,933 --> 00:11:53,933
Not just that.

220
00:11:54,833 --> 00:11:55,833
Smell too.

221
00:11:57,066 --> 00:11:58,266
Smell?

222
00:11:59,033 --> 00:12:00,033
What do you mean?

223
00:12:01,233 --> 00:12:02,300
Like now,

224
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,400
I can smell

225
00:12:12,433 --> 00:12:14,166
your tears about to come out.

226
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,399
Just like how some people

227
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,200
can smell when it's about to rain.

228
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:41,133
Bai.
Yes?

229
00:12:41,701 --> 00:12:43,833
Are people staring at me?

230
00:12:46,233 --> 00:12:47,233
No.

231
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,533
You're adapting fast.

232
00:12:48,933 --> 00:12:50,866
You don't look any different from them.

233
00:12:54,033 --> 00:12:55,033
Then,

234
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,933
when can I see Pei Jia?

235
00:12:59,466 --> 00:13:00,466
Soon.

236
00:13:02,533 --> 00:13:03,766
He just told me

237
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:06,466
that the guy who replaced
you already contacted him.

238
00:13:07,266 --> 00:13:09,533
But you two can't meet yet.

239
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,066
Fang Runzhi

240
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:14,033
might still be watching.

241
00:13:17,433 --> 00:13:18,866
Let's go pick up the tickets.

242
00:13:26,033 --> 00:13:26,766
Touch me again and I'll hit you.

243
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Hey!

244
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:29,800
Don't move.

245
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:40,700
Bai?

246
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:45,900
Bai?

247
00:13:48,633 --> 00:13:49,633
Bai!

248
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:03,800
Pei...

249
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:05,700
Pei Jia?

250
00:14:06,133 --> 00:14:07,266
Why are you here?

251
00:14:18,233 --> 00:14:19,233
I love you.

252
00:14:23,433 --> 00:14:24,266
This is

253
00:14:24,267 --> 00:14:26,066
your favorite movie, right?

254
00:14:29,733 --> 00:14:30,733
I love you.

255
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,066
Counting this time,

256
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:37,366
I've seen it nine times.

257
00:14:38,733 --> 00:14:39,733
No,

258
00:14:40,433 --> 00:14:41,433
eight and a half.

259
00:14:41,866 --> 00:14:44,300
This time I can only hear it.

260
00:14:50,333 --> 00:14:51,366
You can't see it

261
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:53,860
but I'll describe it for you.

262
00:14:55,866 --> 00:14:57,546
It's good enough if you don't fall asleep.

263
00:15:16,133 --> 00:15:17,133
Honestly,

264
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,366
I never liked the dark.

265
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:26,800
And now?

266
00:15:30,533 --> 00:15:31,533
Now I do.

267
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,200
Because you're here.

268
00:15:47,433 --> 00:15:48,433
I love you too.

269
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,933
But if he finds out we're in contact,

270
00:16:06,233 --> 00:16:08,533
he'll leak all the photos.

271
00:16:09,733 --> 00:16:11,033
If everything goes well tonight

272
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,633
I'll see Fang Runzhi tomorrow.

273
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:13,900
Don't worry.

274
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,500
I'll deal with him soon.

275
00:16:17,033 --> 00:16:17,700
Shh.
He's here.

276
00:16:23,233 --> 00:16:24,233
How did you get in?

277
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,300
I talked to the director.

278
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:28,000
I wanted to get close to you.

279
00:16:28,933 --> 00:16:29,933
He gave me your room key.

280
00:16:31,633 --> 00:16:32,900
What do you want?

281
00:16:37,033 --> 00:16:38,033
Jia,

282
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,866
didn't you date Su Yi?

283
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,333
Why can't you act with me now?

284
00:16:45,266 --> 00:16:46,466
How did you know it?

285
00:16:47,066 --> 00:16:48,566
Mr. Fang told me

286
00:16:49,266 --> 00:16:51,466
that you two kissed
on the street after wrap.

287
00:16:58,666 --> 00:16:59,700
So it's true.

288
00:17:02,033 --> 00:17:03,100
How did he know it?

289
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:04,900
Why did he tell you?

290
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,400
Who knows?

291
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:09,866
Maybe people will

292
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,400
say anything in the bed.

293
00:17:19,066 --> 00:17:20,099
You and Fang Runzhi?

294
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:22,300
Yep. I slept with him.

295
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,066
I slept with him.

296
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:26,100
He gave me a role.

297
00:17:27,533 --> 00:17:28,533
Fair trade, right?

298
00:17:28,933 --> 00:17:29,933
Yeah.

299
00:17:31,266 --> 00:17:33,366
Guess Fang's gotten bold.

300
00:17:34,433 --> 00:17:35,766
In this industry,

301
00:17:37,266 --> 00:17:38,533
everyone makes sacrifices.

302
00:17:42,666 --> 00:17:45,766
Su Yi got fooled by you.

303
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,200
Told you,

304
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,833
he's not worth it. You're more fun.

305
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,400
Fancy some wine?

306
00:18:05,433 --> 00:18:06,433
Sure.

307
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:22,333
Play with me?

308
00:18:29,666 --> 00:18:30,666
Foreplay?

309
00:18:34,233 --> 00:18:35,233
Get lost.

310
00:18:36,833 --> 00:18:38,100
I've seen your type.

311
00:18:39,066 --> 00:18:40,066
You're not worth it.

312
00:18:46,533 --> 00:18:47,533
Pei Jia.

313
00:18:48,266 --> 00:18:49,100
Without the company
and Mr. Fang,

314
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:51,533
you are nothing!

315
00:19:12,433 --> 00:19:13,300
Exactly.

316
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:15,200
He kicked me out when I said no.

317
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,866
So why did you go to his room?

318
00:19:19,466 --> 00:19:21,133
Director told me to run lines.

319
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:22,600
Should I go now?

320
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:24,700
No need to bother.

321
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,200
I'll go to set tomorrow.

322
00:19:29,933 --> 00:19:30,933
Alright.

323
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,433
No earpiece today.

324
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,333
Shen's entourage is intense.

325
00:19:43,666 --> 00:19:45,766
Three assistants just for a mic.

326
00:19:47,666 --> 00:19:49,499
I'm afraid that someone may hit me

327
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,733
as I refused to be harassed.

328
00:19:53,233 --> 00:19:56,166
Hey, protect Mr. Shen well.

329
00:19:56,466 --> 00:19:58,000
He is a good actor.

330
00:19:59,066 --> 00:20:00,800
Mic him up well.

331
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,066
Sound quality matters.

332
00:20:04,533 --> 00:20:05,466
Clear the set.

333
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:06,933
Ready?

334
00:20:08,033 --> 00:20:10,733
Director, today's scene
is just ambient, no lines.

335
00:20:10,866 --> 00:20:12,966
Then no mics?

336
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,732
Nope, still mic them.

337
00:20:15,733 --> 00:20:17,366
What if they improv?

338
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,000
Alright.

339
00:20:18,033 --> 00:20:19,033
Got it.

340
00:20:20,833 --> 00:20:22,233
Move fast.

341
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:23,800
Mics ready?

342
00:20:24,633 --> 00:20:25,633
Quiet on set!

343
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,233
Scene 12-1, shot 9, take 1.

344
00:20:31,033 --> 00:20:32,033
Okay!

345
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:33,832
3

346
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:34,865
2

347
00:20:34,866 --> 00:20:36,000
1

348
00:20:36,033 --> 00:20:37,033
Action.

349
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:39,100
Stop!

350
00:20:40,733 --> 00:20:42,000
Stop, stop!

351
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:43,300
Stop!

352
00:20:44,433 --> 00:20:45,433
Cut.

353
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:49,300
Mr. Fang.

354
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:50,733
Why do you keep showing up on set?

355
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:52,866
Others leave.

356
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,200
Pei Jia stays.

357
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:55,732
We're behind schedule,

358
00:20:55,733 --> 00:20:57,633
can we hurry?

359
00:21:02,466 --> 00:21:03,932
Fine, fine.

360
00:21:03,933 --> 00:21:05,566
Everyone's done for the day.

361
00:21:06,266 --> 00:21:07,266
Pei Jia stays.

362
00:21:10,733 --> 00:21:11,866
Obedient now, huh?

363
00:21:33,066 --> 00:21:34,200
Powerful enough

364
00:21:34,733 --> 00:21:37,366
to shut the whole crew down.

365
00:21:38,133 --> 00:21:39,293
What did you do to Shen Xing?

366
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,833
That little pet of yours?

367
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:47,033
I came here last time

368
00:21:47,466 --> 00:21:50,100
to deal with a pet problem as well.

369
00:21:51,933 --> 00:21:53,033
He can be tamed.

370
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:54,500
But I can't.

371
00:22:10,633 --> 00:22:12,633
Find out who is the master
before beating the dog.

372
00:22:14,466 --> 00:22:17,899
You didn't come here
just to slap me, right?

373
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:20,766
Now you realize how
important you are to me?

374
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:24,800
What about Su Yi?

375
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:25,933
Is he important?
Su Yi?

376
00:22:27,433 --> 00:22:28,966
Your dying little pet?

377
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,600
He's my lover.

378
00:22:31,533 --> 00:22:32,866
Well, he's awfully disobedient.

379
00:22:33,466 --> 00:22:34,366
I warned him

380
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,900
not to contact you anymore.

381
00:22:36,666 --> 00:22:37,666
How did you warn him?

382
00:22:38,833 --> 00:22:40,466
You haven't seen those photos.

383
00:22:41,233 --> 00:22:42,433
They're quite something.

384
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,033
Young and wild.

385
00:22:45,933 --> 00:22:47,033
Su Yi's not like that.

386
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:50,700
Took a lot of drugs

387
00:22:50,866 --> 00:22:52,366
to get him in bed.

388
00:22:53,333 --> 00:22:54,433
You really should see it.

389
00:22:54,466 --> 00:22:56,666
He didn't want it.

390
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,400
It even made me

391
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,600
feel bad for him.

392
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,866
Why did you do it?

393
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,533
If you behaved good,

394
00:23:06,933 --> 00:23:08,166
I wouldn't need to drug him.

395
00:23:09,233 --> 00:23:10,833
Though I can't get you,

396
00:23:11,533 --> 00:23:12,933
I'd take your pet.

397
00:23:13,666 --> 00:23:14,766
I'll kill you!

398
00:23:15,066 --> 00:23:16,800
Pei Jia! Pei Jia! Pei Jia!

399
00:23:16,866 --> 00:23:18,100
He just admitted it.

400
00:23:18,233 --> 00:23:18,966
He did.
Calm down.

401
00:23:19,401 --> 00:23:20,665
Admitted? Admitted what?

402
00:23:20,666 --> 00:23:21,733
That I hit you?

403
00:23:21,933 --> 00:23:22,400
Huh?

404
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:24,209
Yi, didn't you say he sucked at acting

405
00:23:24,233 --> 00:23:25,299
and asked me to teach him a lesson?

406
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:26,300
Right?

407
00:23:27,133 --> 00:23:28,173
This is for your own good.

408
00:23:28,266 --> 00:23:29,626
Mr. Fang doing so is for our sake.

409
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:34,100
Trust me.

410
00:23:41,033 --> 00:23:42,033
Fine.

411
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,200
Got it.
