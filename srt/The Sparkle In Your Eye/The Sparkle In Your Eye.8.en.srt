"The Sparkle in Your Eye"

4
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:52,420
(Episode 8)

5
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,880
I just wanted to make a good film,

6
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,856
but ended up kissing up to those big shots.

7
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,480
This is Su Yi's celebration

8
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,560
not your networking event!

9
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,999
I will leave with him soon.

10
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,600
You may enjoy and celebrate.

11
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,560
So,

12
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,440
you are still leaving me?

13
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:10,120
Yi Wei, you are drunk.

14
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,520
Let's talk when you sober up.

15
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,280
I'm scared that I won't
get the chance when I do.

16
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,840
I'm scared

17
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,800
that when I wake up,

18
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,440
you'll just treat me like a friend.

19
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,800
I'm scared that you
will be a coworker only.

20
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,200
We won't go back to how things were… right?

21
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,440
Yi Wei,

22
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,880
we've already changed.

23
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,120
Is it because I changed?

24
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,440
I don't know.

25
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,120
But I know

26
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,200
even if we get back together now,

27
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,520
we may

28
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:04,680
break up again for some reason one day.

29
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,400
I can't do that all over again.

30
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,560
So what is the reason?

31
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:17,840
Is it because

32
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,640
I'm not someone

33
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,040
who deserves your love?

34
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,120
No.

35
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,280
Because I'm too weak?

36
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,040
Because I don't even care
what crap I'm filming now?

37
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,080
No.

38
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,599
Because I try to please people like a dog

39
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,200
and I can't even do that right?

40
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:33,760
No.

41
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,880
Because I know everything
you said was right,

42
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,400
but I never listen?

43
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:39,440
No.

44
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,239
Because I never cared how you felt?

45
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,080
Yi Wei, please, stop.

46
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,360
Stop it.

47
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,680
You know what's really pathetic?

48
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,720
The most pathetic thing

49
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,080
is that I don't even know how to change.

50
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,400
I even never thought about it.

51
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,640
I...

52
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,840
I thought I was doing fine.

53
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,719
But I was wrong.

54
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:08,800
I was so wrong.

55
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,480
We're not who we were.

56
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,320
We can't stay the same.

57
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:21,480
But I want to be better.

58
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,680
I know we can't go back.

59
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,520
But I want to be someone

60
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,040
you'd be willing to accept me again.

61
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:41,360
Give me one more chance, okay?

62
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,080
Idiot.

63
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,040
Why are you dressed like that?

64
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,120
If I'm not dressed like this

65
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,520
and we get photographed,

66
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,160
we're done for.

67
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,800
Come on, no one noticed us.

68
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,640
Hey.

69
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,400
Did you just roll your eyes at me?

70
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:08,840
How did you know?

71
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,760
Your eye rolls are loud.

72
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,440
Even on set I can hear them.

73
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,800
Good ears.

74
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:16,060
Blind people have good hearing.

75
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
You're not blind.

76
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,800
Alright, I get it.

77
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:23,880
Hurry up.

78
00:06:23,881 --> 00:06:25,080
Wait, stop.

79
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:28,060
Peace sign.

80
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:30,220
Both hands.

81
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:31,780
Put one down!

82
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:39,259

How's it?

86
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:47,860

It should be good.

Look,

00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:58,259
look at this photo.

92
00:06:58,260 --> 00:06:59,980
No one will recognize you.

93
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:07,540
Hey,

94
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:08,699
put it on.

95
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:09,700
They will see you.

96
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:11,660
Take one more with me.

97
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,060
What?

98
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:14,220
Take one more with me.

99
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,500
Okay.

100
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:20,140

Cute.

106
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:36,860
You pulled my mouth crooked.

107
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:41,700
This one's nice.

108
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,500
And this one!

109
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:46,020
This one is also good.

110
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:48,580
Why are they all so good?

111
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:50,500
Here, look at this one!

112
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:52,740
Since they are good,

113
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:54,060
should we put them up?

114
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:57,180
Sure, where?

115
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:59,060
Let me see.

(You may come to the company
to sign the contract this weekend.)

131
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:27,380
Official signing's set.

132
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,380
This weekend.

133
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:31,780
So soon?

134
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:32,580
Yeah.

135
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:35,380
Mr. Fang wants to hold a press conference.

136
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:39,020
You'll have to go too.

137
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:46,020
You are... upset?

138
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:51,860
No.

139
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:55,020
I'm happy for you.

140
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:59,100
If it's what you want,

141
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:01,260
I'm happy for you.

142
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:11,060
Meeting you on that set

143
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:14,860
was the best part.

144
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:15,740
Who's this?

145
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:18,459
Pei Jia! Pei Jia!

146
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:20,020
Look over here!

147
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:23,820
Pei Jia.

148
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:25,460
Look over here!

149
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:29,740
Pei Jia, look at the camera.

150
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:41,580
Hi everyone,

151
00:10:41,581 --> 00:10:43,179
welcome.

152
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:46,380
Thank you for supporting Pei Jia.

153
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:48,300
But today's spotlight

154
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:50,459
is Su Yi.

155
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:51,700
Su Yi, say hi to everyone.

156
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,220
Hi, I'm Su Yi.

157
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:57,739
I'm still new

158
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,260
to acting.

159
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:03,380
I hope to learn from Pei Jia

160
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:05,740
and improve myself

161
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:09,420
to have wonderful works, thanks.

162
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:18,300
Learning from just me may not be enough.

163
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:20,860
Ha-ha.

164
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:22,060
Okay,
starting today,

165
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:25,740
Su Yi is officially part of our company.

166
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:28,379
He'll have lots of chances

167
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:29,860
to learn from everyone.

168
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:31,980
Please keep him in mind.

169
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:35,419
And don't forget to check out

170
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:37,219
our upcoming film

171
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:39,220
starring both Pei Jia and Su Yi!

172
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:43,980
Okay, now it's time for open questions!

173
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,020
Mr. Fang,

174
00:11:47,021 --> 00:11:49,060
any expectations for this film?

175
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:51,980
None.

176
00:11:51,981 --> 00:11:55,700
But I think they'll
connect with the audience.

177
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:59,420
As long as we break even, we're good.

178
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:01,020
Pei Jia,

179
00:12:01,021 --> 00:12:04,020
this is your first BL series, right?

180
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:06,300
How does it feel?

181
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:10,740
Well,

182
00:12:10,741 --> 00:12:13,580
I think it's like any love story.

183
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:17,220
It's all about sincere emotions.

184
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:19,140
There's no real difference.

185
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:20,700
What's new for you

186
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:23,340
in this performance?

187
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:25,219
As for that,

188
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:28,100
I guess meeting Su Yi,
such a sweet newcomer,

189
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:30,500
really helped me...

190
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:33,580
Well,

191
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:38,179
He really helped me dive deeper

192
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:39,460
into the role.

193
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:43,980
Su Yi,

194
00:12:43,981 --> 00:12:46,900
what was it like working with Pei Jia?

195
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:50,780
Well, I feel great.

196
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,700
Mr. Pei is a very nice senior to me.

197
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:56,500
He helps me a lot on set,

198
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:58,060
very supportive.

199
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:01,260
Did you ever

200
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:03,220
run into Pei Jia's rumored partners?

201
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:08,180
No, I haven't heard anything like that.

202
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:10,139
Excuse me,

203
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:11,499
I'd like to ask you two

204
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,859
if portraying a couple

205
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:15,780
sparked any real emotions between you?

206
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:18,220
Any sparks between you two offscreen?

207
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:34,420
Well, in fact, on set,

208
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:37,299
we become the characters

209
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:38,900
and feel what they feel.

210
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:41,860
That's our job.

211
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:47,020
But for offscreen, we are good friends.

212
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:53,260
Yeah, we get along
with each other offscreen.

213
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:02,819
Pei Jia! Jia!

214
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:04,820
Pei Jia! Pei Jia!

215
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:06,100
Have a good rest!

216
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:08,260
Have a good rest!

217
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:09,300
So cute!

218
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:11,980
So cute!

219
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:16,140
Pei Jia, have a good rest!

220
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:17,620
Pei Jia!
Everyone,

221
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:19,500
this way please.

222
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:21,660
Pei Jia's event is over.

223
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:28,620
What? Tired?

224
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:30,260
Sort of.

225
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:31,460
Already?

226
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,860
What about the party later?

227
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:35,820
Will that be worse?

228
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:37,860
You didn't attend one before?

229
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,500
No.

230
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:43,460
It's fine.

231
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:47,420
It's just chatting with
rich people over drinks.

232
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:49,659
Stick close to me,

233
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:50,660
talk less,

234
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:54,180
smile more when you
have no topic to chat about.

235
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:55,700
Got it?

236
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:57,740
Got it.

237
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:23,420
It's like conveyor belt sushi.

238
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:24,460
Want anything?

239
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:25,660
Nope.

240
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:37,220
They are here.

241
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:40,980
Congrats
on the signing!

242
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:45,300
Thank you, Director!

243
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:46,900
Work hard.

244
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:47,940
I will.

245
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:52,180
Su Yi, drink less.

246
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:54,100
Don't wander off alone, got it?

247
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:56,380
Don't worry, Bai, I'll be fine.

248
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:57,580
I'll watch him.

249
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:00,459
Okay, enjoy yourselves then.

250
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:01,460
See you later.

251
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:02,540
Okay.

252
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:07,420
Come on, have one.

253
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,100
Good.

254
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:10,500
It tastes nice.

255
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:14,340
Pei Jia, my old friend!

256
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:15,220
Come on.

257
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:16,459
Hello, hello.

258
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:17,460
It's been a while.

259
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:18,540
It's been a while.

260
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:19,180
Long time no see.
Nice to meet you.

261
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:22,019
This is Ms. Li from the platform.

262
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:22,660
Oh!
Hello, Ms. Li.

263
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:24,780
This is Su Yi.

264
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,100
Working on any new projects?

265
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:27,939
Yes, planning a new one.

266
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:28,300
Good.

267
00:16:28,301 --> 00:16:29,540
Any role for him?

268
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:30,460
Thanks.

269
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:31,980
He's been a fan of martial arts.

270
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:33,820
I read many novels about it before.

271
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:44,300
Mr. Fang,

272
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:45,940
not drinking with them?

273
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,100
Looking forward to your new film.

274
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:52,140
Mr. Li,

275
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:53,780
do give Su Yi a chance.

276
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:58,940
I think you two are promising.

277
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:00,380
It's my honor.
My honor.

278
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:02,820
Thanks, thanks.

279
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:16,660
See you later.
My pleasure.

280
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:19,780
Jia, Mr. Fang needs to see you.

281
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:22,460
What's wrong?
What's the matter?

282
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:25,420
Mr. Fang is meeting an investor.

283
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,460
That investor wants to meet you.

284
00:17:26,461 --> 00:17:27,500
Just go.

285
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:30,220
I'll go with Su Yi then.

286
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:32,220
It's not proper...

287
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:34,820
How come?

288
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:37,060
Su Yi is the star tonight.

289
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,580
But Mr. Fang wants to meet you alone.

290
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:41,020
I can't help it.

291
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:43,780
Just go.

292
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:47,660
I'll be fine.

293
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:51,980
Remember,

294
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:53,780
don't drink too much.

295
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:55,500
If anything happens,

296
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:57,179
find Su Bai and Yi Wei.

297
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:58,180
Alright,

298
00:17:58,860 --> 00:17:59,860
just go.

299
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:01,420
Come on.

300
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:10,340
Thanks.

301
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,700
Please have a seat here.

302
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:19,220
Mr. Fang is coming.

303
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:33,339
Nice to see you.

304
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:35,419
You are talented. Hope
to work together soon.

305
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:36,060
Sure,

306
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:37,459
no problem.

307
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:38,979
Thank you, thank you.

308
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:39,780
Thank you.

309
00:18:39,781 --> 00:18:40,900
Thank you for your support.

310
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:57,140
Amazing and talented.

311
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:59,060
Thank you.

312
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:01,220
Let's work together.

313
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:04,660
I have strong empathy,

314
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:06,460
so I can get into most roles easily.

315
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:06,980
Thanks.

316
00:19:06,981 --> 00:19:08,260
Thank you.

317
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:09,700
Friends of Pei Jia are mine too.

318
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:16,060
Yeah...

319
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:25,300
Okay.

320
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:30,180
No problem.
Sure, no problem.

321
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:32,100
Thank you so much.

322
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:33,620
Okay.

323
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:35,460
Yes, totally understand.

324
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:25,380
You have to wait a bit longer.
Mr. Fang is still busy.

325
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:57,580
Pei Jia?

326
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:01,140
Pei Jia?

327
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:03,980
Where are you taking me?

328
00:21:58,380 --> 00:21:59,500
Pei Jia...
