"The Sparkle In Your Eye"

2
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:53,000
(Episode 2)

3
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:03,360
Ah.

4
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,040
Ah.

5
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,400
You okay.

6
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,360
What happened?

7
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,120
I think I sprained my ankle.

8
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,360
You alright?

9
00:01:12,361 --> 00:01:13,480
I'm not okay, Director.

10
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,240
Not sure if the bone's broken.

11
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,760
Could you fetch the first aid kit?

12
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:20,240
Xiao Su.

13
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,399
Take care of Teacher Pei.

14
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,400
Got it.

15
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,280
The front desk should have a first aid kit

16
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:31,920
I'll go check.

17
00:01:31,921 --> 00:01:33,520
And get your room cards reissued.

18
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,760
Please reissue our room cards.

19
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,959
Certainly. May I have your names?

20
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:51,960
- Pei Jia.
- Su Yi.

21
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,360
Reissuing Mr. Su's V2.

22
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,440
Or Mr. Pei's V3.

23
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,840
Or your V1 suite?

24
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:12,560
Explain yourselves.

25
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,719
Su Yi, you've made it.

26
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:16,400
Got money now.

27
00:02:16,401 --> 00:02:18,120
You can afford such an expensive suite.

28
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,000
Sorry, Director.

29
00:02:20,001 --> 00:02:21,200
My mistake.

30
00:02:21,289 --> 00:02:22,520
Didn't I make it clear?

31
00:02:22,521 --> 00:02:25,235
Your romantic scenes with Teacher Pei are
vital. And need proper chemistry development.

32
00:02:26,265 --> 00:02:27,265
You did.

33
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,480
Teacher Pei is your senior.

34
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:31,653
His solo suite request was understandable.

35
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:33,070
What's your excuse?

36
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,240
Don't worry Xiao Su

37
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,760
I'll cover your room charges.

38
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,800
No need.

39
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,000
Actually, Teacher Pei.

40
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,160
Regarding your recent...
Performance.

41
00:02:45,161 --> 00:02:46,960
The crew has taken notice.

42
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:50,160
Though we're a low-budget production.

43
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:51,959
We do have binding contracts.

44
00:02:52,205 --> 00:02:53,205
Right.

45
00:02:56,302 --> 00:02:57,302
Director

46
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,720
I'll fully cooperate from now on.

47
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:03,760
Well.

48
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:05,760
Originally

49
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,880
I came to discuss tomorrow's scenes.

50
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:09,640
Enough.

51
00:03:09,641 --> 00:03:11,480
Your only task today.

52
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,960
Is to stay in this suite.

53
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,040
No going anywhere

54
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,360
I'll inspect tomorrow.

55
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,120
Huh.

56
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,640
Xiao Su.

57
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,560
This room.

58
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,720
Did you decorate this.

59
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,720
Ah, yes.

60
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,680
Quite thoughtful.

61
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,120
Limited edition.

62
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,560
Yeah.

63
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,999
Took me ages to acquire.

64
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,200
With your autograph too.

65
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,760
It's fake.

66
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,720
Fake?!

67
00:04:28,296 --> 00:04:29,416
And the signed letter.

68
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,360
I know my own signature.

69
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,560
Never wrote any fan letters.

70
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:46,120
No worries, I'll sign another.

71
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,600
Forget it then.

72
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:52,760
I need to shower.

73
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:53,760
Get out.

74
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,480
I'm taking a shower.

75
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,960
Would you mind leaving?

76
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,560
Fine.

77
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,320
<i>Fake.</i>

78
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,400
<i>Never wrote any fan letters.</i>

79
00:06:00,993 --> 00:06:06,610
(Pei Jia announces his retirement
due to being caught in a scandal)

80
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,720
Damn, past midnight.

81
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:32,760
Excuse me.

82
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,160
Can I get a refund?

83
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:36,920
Sorry Mr. Su.

84
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,600
We can't process refunds.

85
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,560
What about tomorrow?

86
00:06:41,185 --> 00:06:43,600
Need to confirm with management.

87
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,319
But your group booking.

88
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,760
Complicates things.

89
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,759
Need a room.

90
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,759
What's your deal.

91
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,640
My own suite.

92
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,440
In this hotel.

93
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,520
Interested?

94
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,160
I'll give you a deal.

95
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,000
You're sketchy.

96
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:23,800
Need lodging.

97
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,800
My own suite.

98
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,440
Hey.

99
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,320
How much.

100
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:33,760
You

101
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,760
I'm talking to you.

102
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:35,720
You.

103
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
What are you doing.

104
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,360
Stop pretending.

105
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,360
Play with me.

106
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Are you crazy?

107
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,159
I saw through you immediately.

108
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,400
What's with the act.

109
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,240
Are you out of your mind.

110
00:07:46,241 --> 00:07:48,199
You're trying to...

111
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,280
This is a honey trap

112
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,520
I'm calling the police.

113
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,920
Name.

114
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,400
Huh.

115
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:01,880
Su Yi.

116
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:02,440
Age

117
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:03,200
19.

118
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,200
Occupation.

119
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,560
Used to be a bartender.

120
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,120
Now an actor.

121
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,360
So unemployed either way.

122
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,800
What have you acted in.

123
00:08:13,352 --> 00:08:14,352
Working on it now.

124
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:14,920
Prostitution.

125
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:19,000
It was called
"Blue Canvas of Youthful Days"

126
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,800
I'm asking about solicitation.

127
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,359
Impossible, officer

128
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,960
I was just trying to transfer my room.

129
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:26,840
Scam.

130
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,880
Check the surveillance footage.

131
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,040
Already did.

132
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,400
How much were they transferring

133
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,320
1000 RMB

134
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,640
How many times.

135
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,640
Just this once.

136
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,439
Please believe me, police.

137
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,239
The hotel wouldn't refund me.

138
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,520
So I tried transferring it.

139
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,120
I'm a guy.

140
00:08:42,121 --> 00:08:43,720
Why would I solicit men.

141
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,560
That's what confused us too.

142
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,760
Su Bai.

143
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,760
Ahem.

144
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,440
Make some space

145
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,760
I need to rewrite the script.

146
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,039
Look at their chemistry.

147
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,440
Can we film the bed scene tomorrow?

148
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,320
See.

149
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,960
They act like strangers.

150
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,920
Have you ever seen newlyweds like this?

151
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,560
Yes.

152
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:23,880
Really.

153
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:24,920
Mm-hmm.

154
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,840
Well, I haven't.

155
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,600
Come.

156
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,800
Remember when we first met.

157
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,200
That game you taught me.

158
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:38,880
The one where.

159
00:09:38,881 --> 00:09:41,360
We ask each other ten questions.

160
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,000
To build intimacy fast.

161
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,560
Don't recall.

162
00:09:45,561 --> 00:09:46,800
How could you forget.

163
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,520
You always bring it up when mad.

164
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,360
Still don't.

165
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,520
Which question did you kiss me at?

166
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,320
The eighth.

167
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,160
Oh, the eighth.

168
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,600
Get ready for tomorrow.

169
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,720
List those ten questions for me.

170
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,640
We checked the surveillance.

171
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,360
Talked to the front desk.

172
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,136
It was a misunderstanding.

173
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,520
We lectured that guy.

174
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,360
Good to hear.

175
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,400
Thank you.

176
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:50,080
Get a relative to sign you out.

177
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,520
Or have your parents come.

178
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,000
They're not here.

179
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,720
Friends.

180
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:38,960
Hello

181
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,199
Mr. Pei.

182
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,720
The police station called.

183
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,840
Requesting your assistance.

184
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,560
Who? Where.

185
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,159
Mr. Su Yi.

186
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,000
At Jinshan Road Station.

187
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,680
Did he say why?

188
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,600
No... I don't know.

189
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:14,200
Pei Jia? It is you.

190
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,320
Hey, wait.

191
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:18,640
Need your signature.

192
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:37,960
Your relation.

193
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,040
Don't know him.

194
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,320
Why sign then?

195
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,160
Colleagues.

196
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,520
Sign and you're free.

197
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:54,920
Wait.

198
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,720
Could I get your autograph, please.

199
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,000
My niece adores you.

200
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,760
Uh... thanks

201
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,760
I'll take my leave now.

202
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,520
Hey.

203
00:13:16,968 --> 00:13:18,448
Hey, don't stir up trouble next time.

204
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,200
Yeah, got it.

205
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,720
Holy shit.

206
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,880
That was a genuine
misunderstanding earlier.

207
00:13:39,552 --> 00:13:41,752
I have to be on set in three hours.

208
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,800
Discuss any matters with my assistant.

209
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,240
Pei Jia.

210
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,560
Pei.

211
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,560
You're not trying to scam me, are you?

212
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:15,760
Su Yi.

213
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,240
Su Yi

214
00:14:17,327 --> 00:14:18,327
I'm fine.

215
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,080
Should we call an ambulance?

216
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,240
Just a bit dizzy.

217
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,560
Come.

218
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:41,760
Get on.

219
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:14,800
Pei Jia.

220
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,160
Pei Jia.

221
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,760
What now.

222
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,080
Pei Jia.

223
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,720
How's your rapport with Pei Jia now.

224
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,080
Passable.

225
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,160
Are you familiar with today's scene.

226
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,320
Specifically during the kissing scene.

227
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,840
You need to deliver that.

228
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,720
Sensation of a final kiss.

229
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:51,760
Visualize this.

230
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,400
If you love someone.

231
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,440
Have you ever been in love.

232
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
No.

233
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,120
Alright.

234
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:00,560
Then imagine.

235
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,200
Ah.

236
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,399
You love someone.

237
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,640
From the perspective of the gods.

238
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,720
You already know you're destined to part ways after today.

239
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:09,880
Even if he stops loving you.

240
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:11,120
Even if he resents you.

241
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:12,720
Or feels nothing at all.

242
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,519
Because hatred is still an emotion.

243
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,520
But do you care?

244
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,160
No, you don't.

245
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,680
Channel all your lifetime's selfishness.

246
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:22,720
Into one profound, final kiss.

247
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:26,760
Understood.

248
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,040
Understood.

249
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,560
Let's go.

250
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,520
Thank you, Director.

251
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,160
Take this to Pei Jia.

252
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:36,920
Ohhh.

253
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,720
Wait.

254
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,560
You too.

255
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,720
Thank you, Director.

256
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:44,840
Go ahead.

257
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:50,960
Teacher Yiyi.

258
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,200
My apologies.

259
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,240
Alright.

260
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,160
Brother Jia, your coffee.

261
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,440
Teacher Pei, I apologize.

262
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,240
Last night was all a misunderstanding

263
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,576
I'm not that kind of person

264
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,440
I disturbed your rest.

265
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,480
Truly sorry.

266
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:28,800
Both teachers.

267
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:29,999
Let's build the emotional tension.

268
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Signal when ready.

269
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,120
Relax, don't be nervous.

270
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,520
Okay.

271
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:39,960
We're ready, Director.

272
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:41,760
Let's go.

273
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:42,800
Alright, rolling.

274
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:43,800
Camera rolling

275
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,200
3

276
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:45,960
2

277
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:46,880
1

278
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:47,920
Action!

279
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,400
If a lie can be maintained for a lifetime.

280
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:53,520
It becomes the truth.

281
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:55,960
To me.

282
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,160
You need only say it once.

283
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,360
To fuel a lifetime of memories.

284
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:03,560
I'm begging you.

285
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:05,400
Say you love me

286
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,600
I can't even feign
interest in speaking to you.

287
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,640
I'm pleading with you.

288
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:12,240
Don't degrade love this way.

289
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,520
Then I'll pretend you said it.

290
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,680
Regardless of your tone.

291
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,080
Come.

292
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:21,120
Cut.

293
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,400
What happened.

294
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,160
Sorry Director.

295
00:19:23,161 --> 00:19:24,280
Need to reset.

296
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,360
Don't stress.

297
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,600
Treat me as woman.

298
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,400
With the way I look,
you'll have a good time.

299
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,400
Smile.

300
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,400
Come.

301
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,200
Director, Su Yi is ready.

302
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:41,560
Let's go.

303
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,160
Come.

304
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,360
Action.

305
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,200
Then I'll take it as you've said it.

306
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:54,920
No matter what tone you used.

307
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,640
Cut!

308
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,720
Teacher Pei why did you go on set.

309
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,520
He looked too nervous.

310
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,800
Helping him get into character.

311
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:21,560
Alright.

312
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,600
Well? Did you find the feeling?

313
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,400
Director, let's do another take.

314
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:30,200
Good.

315
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:32,000
Let's go.

316
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,240
And...

317
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,240
Action!

318
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,400
Good! Cut.

319
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,000
Good good good.

320
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,320
Xiao Su has improved.

321
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,120
Thank you Teacher Pei.

322
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:36,440
Thank you teacher.

323
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,120
If you ask me.

324
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,760
Living together works wonders, eh.

325
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:39,600
Come.

326
00:21:39,601 --> 00:21:40,800
His progress is remarkable.

327
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,280
That's a wrap.

328
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:56,800
Xiao Su.

329
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:57,840
Let's go.

330
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,800
Next we'll shoot scene eight.

331
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:12,120
Should we discuss with the director first.

332
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,559
Understood, I'll talk to the director.

333
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:14,600
Yes Teacher Pei.

334
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:21,360
Teacher Pei.

335
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:24,320
I still want to apologize.

336
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,400
For troubling you yesterday.

337
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:29,200
Yet you still coached me today.

338
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:32,360
You're you and I'm me.

339
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:37,920
Do you know if someone saw Pei Jia
going to the police station at midnight.

340
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,960
How many headlines can
these vultures even score off me?

341
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,639
I don't care if last night you were.

342
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:46,600
In a fight.

343
00:22:46,601 --> 00:22:47,680
Or stealing money.

344
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,920
It's none of my business.

345
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,720
Nor do I care.

346
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,359
We just.

347
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:56,040
Need to focus on our jobs.

348
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,080
Contact my assistant for any issues.

349
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,239
Preferably no issues.

350
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,360
Understood.

351
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,160
Fine.

352
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:07,840
Brother Jia.

353
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,199
Got the chips you wanted.

354
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,200
And mini crackers.

355
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,160
Hey.

356
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:12,920
Teacher Yi

357
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,120
I wasn't calling you.

358
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,400
Huh.

359
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:25,160
Remember that fan who wrote me letters.

360
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,920
Yes, I even wrote the replies.

361
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,120
What was the name.

362
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,960
Can't recall, why.

363
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,320
Nothing.

364
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,800
Just can't remember the name
