"The Sparkle in Your Eye"

00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:52,420
(Episode 7)

5
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:04,800
Su Yi,

6
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,160
don't go to his agency.

7
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,600
I will think about it.

8
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:28,499
(Pei Jia, I've thought about it. It's a good
chance for me to enter Mr. Fang's agency.

9
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:31,019
(Don't...)

10
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:36,540
(Mr. Fang is holding a party
for me. Are you coming?)

11
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,000
(One year ago)

12
00:01:41,001 --> 00:01:42,240
You're an actor now.

13
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,760
Work's different from before.

14
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,360
So, how's it going? Getting used to it?

15
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,120
I am, Mr. Fang.

16
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,600
I mean, I used to do this anyway.

17
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,800
Really?

18
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,400
Relax.

19
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,200
Didn't you say you're used to it now?

20
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:13,000
Well, I still need more practice.

21
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,640
Get more used to it.

22
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,320
You're with my company now.

23
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:22,640
If you have any requests for projects,

24
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,840
or want support,

25
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,000
just come to me.

26
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,760
Got it?

27
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,920
I still have a lot of fans supporting me.

28
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,720
If I need anything, I'll let you know.

29
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:37,840
Fans?

30
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,760
What can fans help you?

31
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,800
When you have to quit

32
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,800
from show business,

33
00:02:41,801 --> 00:02:43,200
it's exactly them who berated you.

34
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:45,960
If not for me,

35
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,400
you'd probably still be
passed out drunk in some club.

36
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:54,360
The only reason I signed with your company

37
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,720
was because one fan told me

38
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:01,000
that he'll always be right there for me.

39
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,240
Well.

40
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,520
I'm looking forward to it.

41
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,440
Hi.

42
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,560
What are you doing here?

43
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:39,599
Aren't we grabbing
drinks later with Su Yi?

44
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,400
I thought I'd swing by

45
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,400
so we could go together.

46
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,800
That's not on the way.

47
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,920
How is it not?

48
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:45,840
Same starting point,

49
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,840
same destination.

50
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,000
Still not on the way.

51
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,360
Weird, huh?

52
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,599
Where's Su Yi anyway?

53
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,600
Su Yi!

54
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:56,840
Su Yi!

55
00:03:56,841 --> 00:03:58,320
He's working.

56
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,400
It's our family affair, not your concern.

57
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,999
Didn't he sign a contract?

58
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,800
Why hasn't he quit the bar job?

59
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,160
When did you find out he signed?

60
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,760
Don't look at me like that.

61
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,320
I just found out too.

62
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,120
See?

63
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:18,140
- (- Director Yi, I've decided to go to Mr. Fang's.
- (Are you sure? - Yeah, I've thought it over.)

64
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,320
Still so hostile toward Fang Runzhi?

65
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:24,160
You know what kind of person he is.

66
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,120
What?

67
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,000
You mean...

68
00:04:26,001 --> 00:04:28,320
the rumor he sleeps with his actors?

69
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,320
But that's consensual, right?

70
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,960
What if it's not?

71
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,199
If someone was really forced,

72
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,640
wouldn't they have spoken up by now?

73
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,440
Fang Runzhi asked you to change the script,

74
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,160
cut scenes, swap actors,

75
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,919
and you didn't want that either.

76
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:44,920
Did you expose him?

77
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,400
Where are you going?

78
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,160
To drink with Su Yi.

79
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,200
This early?

80
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,920
Come on, cheers!

81
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,120
Mr. Fang told me

82
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,799
that he'd contact

83
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,359
Schwarzenegger,

84
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,800
The Rock...

85
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,320
Hey, Su Yi.

86
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,600
Someone's here for you, go say hi.

87
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,400
I'm kind of lucky...

88
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,000
You know him?

89
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,040
I didn't know

90
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,040
you were a fan.

91
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,600
I'm not.

92
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,199
When you were the cleaner,

93
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,520
he was here almost every night

94
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,200
for a week.

95
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,200
Really?

96
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,160
He's weird.

97
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,759
He always ordered one drink,

98
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,999
and sat there till close.

99
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,239
He looked familiar,

100
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,800
so I searched him online.
What's his name again?

101
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:44,440
Jia?

102
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,160
Pei Jia.

103
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,320
Exactly!

104
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,320
Pei Jia!

105
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:53,600
By the way,

106
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,600
I've told the boss

107
00:05:54,601 --> 00:05:56,520
I can't help with guests tonight.

108
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,560
It's fine.

109
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,520
Come on.

110
00:06:02,521 --> 00:06:03,799
It's a big day.

111
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,320
Stop working.

112
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:07,320
Here,

113
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,279
let's celebrate for Su Yi's

114
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,440
new agency!

115
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,000
Cheers.

116
00:06:12,001 --> 00:06:13,800
Thank you.

117
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,799
Su Yi, you invited

118
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,239
us to drink.

119
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,680
You have to drink with us.

120
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:23,920
Well...

121
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,239
I called you here because I wanted

122
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,959
to say thanks for everything

123
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,240
you've done for me.

124
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,719
This one's for you all.

125
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,720
Cheers.

126
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,800
Alright,

127
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,640
we are all close.

128
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,720
No need to be formal.

129
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:41,600
Come on.

130
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:43,359
We're here to have fun.

131
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,400
Just enjoy yourself. Drink up!

132
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:49,840
Bai.

133
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Su Yi,

134
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,360
now that you've signed,

135
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,120
you are officially in the industry.

136
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,560
As someone who spotted your talent,

137
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,840
let me give you some advice.

138
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:10,640
In this industry, there
are things you can't say,

139
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,000
and people you can't offend.

140
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,560
There's too much of that.

141
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,720
Like me,

142
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,840
I just wanted to make a good film,

143
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,200
but ended up kissing up to those big shots.

144
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,360
Right?

145
00:07:21,361 --> 00:07:22,639
I wanted to be like your brother,

146
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,799
giving up the scripts

147
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,920
he has wrote for years.

148
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,720
This is Su Yi's celebration

149
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,640
not your networking event!

150
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,200
Alright.

151
00:07:32,201 --> 00:07:33,800
Take your drama home.

152
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,840
Don't kill the mood.

153
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:40,400
Come on,

154
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,400
let's drink.

155
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,520
Congrats.

156
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,600
Thanks.

157
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,560
Thanks.

158
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:51,200
♫ By the sea with fireworks,

00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,080
Why are you just staring at me?

187
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,720
Need help with something?

188
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,640
Can you mop?

189
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,600
Nope, the cleaning lady does.

190
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,520
Wash dishes?

191
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,640
I don't cook, I order in.

192
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,560
Then what can you do?

193
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,600
Fine.

194
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,520
Just drink.

195
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,120
That suits you more.

196
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,600
Want anything else?

197
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,440
A drink made by you.

198
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,720
Anything's fine.

199
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,800
Why aren't you drinking it?

200
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:13,360
Cough...

201
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,200
Who even drinks absinthe?

202
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,760
You're drinking it too fast.

203
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:34,960
You know what?

204
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,999
Van Gogh drank too much absinthe

205
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:38,800
and hallucinated.

206
00:11:38,801 --> 00:11:40,400
Then he cut off his own ear.

207
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:41,760
What?

208
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,960
Absinthe causes hallucinations.

209
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,160
You don't know?

210
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,599
So what I'm seeing now is a hallucination?

211
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,600
Yeah.

212
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:57,000
Ha-ha.

213
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,600
I'm kidding.

214
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,640
So you made this just to mess with me?

215
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,600
Not really.

216
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,360
Why absinthe then?

217
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,240
It looks cool.

218
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,160
Does it have a name?

219
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,640
Not yet.

220
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,440
I haven't decided its name yet.

221
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,200
Why don't you

222
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,440
name it?

223
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,240
Me?

224
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,560
Yeah.

225
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:46,920
If I quit acting and go back
to being a bartender again,

226
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,760
I can tell the customers

227
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:51,119
that this drink was made by Pei Jia,

228
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,440
the super star.

229
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,000
Maybe you'll be more
famous than me by then.

230
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,760
Don't say that.

231
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,560
Hmm…

232
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,120
Let's call it…

233
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,360
Hallucination.

234
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,600
Hallucination?

235
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:17,920
That's it?

236
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,160
Yeah, imagine,

237
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,159
one day,

238
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,560
a customer walks in,

239
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:24,920
snaps his fingers and says,

240
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,320
“Give me a Hallucination.”

241
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,200
Cool, right?

242
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,400
Right now, you feel like a hallucination.

243
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:02,000
Now I do think
Hallucination sounds perfect.

244
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,400
Quite direct.

245
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:08,600
Life feels less and less real lately.

246
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,520
Less real than absinthe.

247
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,000
Don't sign with the company,

248
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,880
Su Yi.

249
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:27,720
Why not?

250
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,600
Relax.

251
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,560
Didn't you say you're used to this?

252
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,000
No reason at all?

253
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:53,000
Pei Jia even taught his partner how to act.

254
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,999
It's a good chance.

255
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,200
Not everyone gets that.

256
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,360
Listen.

257
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,200
Fine.

258
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,240
Go ahead.

259
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:19,960
Not bad.

260
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,600
Fine,

261
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,880
let me guess.

262
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,000
You look down upon me.

263
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:36,360
You think I'm a clingy sidekick.

264
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,999
Now that I've joined

265
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
your company,

266
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:41,800
you're annoyed.

267
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,440
Don't be ridiculous.

268
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,920
I'm Pei Jia.

269
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:50,680
I just think he's a newbie.

270
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,120
I'm just playing along.

271
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,720
You think I'd fall for him?

272
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,360
Right?

273
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,520
I don't look down on you.

274
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,720
No,

275
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:02,880
you don't,

276
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,040
you pity me.

277
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,360
You feel guilty,

278
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,960
trying to bribe me.

279
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,000
I don't pity you.

280
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,800
And I'm not bribing you.

281
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,920
Then why say all this?

282
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,720
Because I like you.

283
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,400
I want to be good to you.

284
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,599
So that's the best excuse

285
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,800
you could come up with?

286
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,599
Why do you think it's an excuse?

287
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,800
From the note to this confession,

288
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,440
what's even real?

289
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,400
Why are you walking alone?

290
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:54,560
Long time no see.

291
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,760
They'll always be right there for me.

292
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,640
But I've been trying to tell you

293
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,280
that even if I lie to myself
that I simply like you,

294
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,040
but from now on,

295
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,000
I love you.

296
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,320
They'll always be right there for me.

297
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,319
Jia, I brought you the chips you want.

298
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,440
And sweets.

299
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,000
Yes?

300
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,160
She didn't call you.

301
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:54,720
It's fine.

302
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,200
I'll sign one for you.

303
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,639
If you can invite anyone to dinner,

304
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,600
who'll be your pick?

305
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:28,840
Finish.

306
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:29,840
You.

307
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,120
They'll always be right there for me.

308
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,600
Do I know you?

309
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,560
This is our first time meeting.

310
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,960
We really never met each other before?

311
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:52,560
I'm sorry.

312
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:54,840
I shouldn't have said all that.

313
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,840
So, you don't like me?

314
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:01,800
That's not it.

315
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,760
I'm telling you not to sign

316
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,000
because of Fang Runzhi.

317
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:09,920
Mr. Fang?

318
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,120
I'm afraid he may…

319
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,480
What?

320
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:17,920
Please.

321
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,760
Don't sign.

322
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,400
But I still want to.

323
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:36,840
Why?

324
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,920
Because it's my fastest shot at fame.

325
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:44,600
You're young,

326
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:46,800
there'll be more chances.

327
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,360
Remember that game?

328
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:54,800
The ten questions?

329
00:21:55,800 --> 00:22:00,000
I said I had a secret
hunch about the future.

330
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,599
You have a secret
hunch about the future?

331
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,880
Yes.

332
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,800
I've had bad eyesight since I was a kid.

333
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,440
You don't wear glasses.

334
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,800
I wear contacts

335
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,040
for the camera.

336
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,440
Hear me out.

337
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:25,000
Before high school,
I thought it was just nearsightedness.

338
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,640
But during the big exam,

339
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,120
I looked up

340
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:30,560
from my math paper

341
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,800
and everything spun.

342
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,240
Afterward,

343
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,200
my left eye went blurry.

344
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,399
I thought maybe

345
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,120
it just got worse.

346
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,520
Then the right one did too.

347
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,360
My eyes felt a bit off.

348
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:50,720
Your eyes?

349
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,600
Yeah, just a bit dry.

350
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,000
Did you go to the hospital?

351
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,000
I just got glasses.

352
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:13,800
But even during the college entrance exam,
I couldn't see anything clearly,

353
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,920
even with them.

354
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:20,760
Sometimes I felt sick and wanted to vomit.

355
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,120
Stress can do that.

356
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,360
It's normal.

357
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,520
How about now?

358
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
I went to the hospital.

359
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,760
They sent me to oncology.

360
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:46,200
CT showed a tumor.

361
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,720
Here.

362
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,800
You dropped something.

363
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,480
The doctor said

364
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:03,120
the tumor's too close to the optic nerve.

365
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,360
It's very risky.

366
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,080
There's a 50% chance

367
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,200
I'll go blind.

368
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,160
No way.

369
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,600
Yi, your admission letter's here!

370
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,159
Everyone's waiting!

371
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,560
Tell them I'm sorry.

372
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,999
Sorry? For what? You did great!

373
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,160
Where are you?

374
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,120
Sorry, Mom.

375
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,400
Tell me,

376
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,520
what's it like to be blind?

377
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,240
You won't be.

378
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:51,600
They say

379
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,240
being blind

380
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,160
is like closing your eyes.

381
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:01,840
Like this.

382
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,520
But you won't go blind.

383
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,160
You won't!

384
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,400
It's like closing your eyes.

385
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,400
You can't see anything,

386
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,160
but you can still sense a bit of light.

387
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:36,960
I just hope

388
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,840
I get that much.

389
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,800
I told you, you won't go blind.

390
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:13,000
What are you doing, Su Yi?

391
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,520
Careful!

392
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,800
But I'm scared.

393
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:45,760
Pei Jia.

394
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,560
I'm not scared of dying.

395
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:52,039
But I'm scared

396
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:55,720
of the slow loss.

397
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,840
I may lose my vision.

398
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:01,400
If the tumor grows,

399
00:27:01,401 --> 00:27:03,359
I may lose hearing,

400
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,519
mobility,

401
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:05,240
until

402
00:27:05,241 --> 00:27:08,720
everything I love is gone.

403
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,800
Then I die.

404
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,800
It's still too soon to bring this up.

405
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:39,800
No,

406
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,000
not at all.

407
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,760
Do you know why I agreed to Su Bai to act?

408
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:06,000
Because I wanted people to see me.

409
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:11,160
Even if I go blind,

410
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,800
I want to be remembered.

411
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,359
I see you.

412
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:17,960
I already do.

413
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,440
I want to sign.

414
00:28:33,241 --> 00:28:34,881
I want the world to see me.

415
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,640
Do you really enjoy acting?

416
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:44,440
Yes. I want everyone to look at me.

417
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:46,160
As long as they see me.

418
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:51,800
Because it may be the only chance

419
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,800
for me to act in a film.

420
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,199
Well done!

421
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,200
Cut!

422
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,400
Happy wrap!

423
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:08,120
Thank you all!

424
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,000
Happy wrap!

425
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:14,960
Okay,

426
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:19,920
I won't stop you then.

427
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,800
You have to catch me then.

428
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:14,640
I will.

429
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:56,520
I'll make sure the whole world sees you.
