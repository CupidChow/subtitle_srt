I'm sure he must have been lonely.

182
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:07,974
Sigh… I wanted to buy you a tree.

183
00:15:09,476 --> 00:15:12,979
(Doctor) Shindo-senpai, I checked what you said earlier...

184
00:15:14,981 --> 00:15:18,918
Well, no matter how much it takes, it's not that short.

185
00:15:18,985 --> 00:15:21,421
Unless you go directly to the lab...

186
00:15:21,488 --> 00:15:23,423
You should go directly.

187
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:24,991
Eh...｡

188
00:15:26,493 --> 00:15:29,496
(Nurse) If you feel tired again, please take this medicine.

189
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:39,372
Ah, I got a little upset earlier and got a little violent.

190
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:41,941
Immediately after surgery.

191
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:50,383
This looks very similar.

192
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:53,453
For the medicine that Ryo's wife gave me.

193
00:15:54,955 --> 00:15:57,390
(Lisa) Huh?

194
00:15:57,457 --> 00:16:02,395
>> I told you I saw you that night.

195
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:07,901
Actually, I also met and talked with my wife afterwards.

196
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:11,404
[Did you really delete everything? Aren't there others left? ]

197
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:15,909
(Kanako's voice) Look, your wife was secretly filming inside the gym.

198
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:20,914
So I said, ``Erase all pictures of me.''

199
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:25,418
(Nagiko) [Could you please bring me one of these medicines? ]

200

201
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:31,925
[Because it doesn't work]

202
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:35,862
(Kanako's voice) It worked quite well for me earlier.

203
00:16:35,929 --> 00:16:40,367
I guess that means it no longer works for my wife.

204
00:16:40,433 --> 00:16:43,436
A medicine to take when you're having a hard time.

205
00:16:50,443 --> 00:16:52,879
(Lisa) I saw it too.
