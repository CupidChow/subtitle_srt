It is said that he purposely stripped off his clothes and showed us the bruises on his body.

She said she got her attention by crying that her husband was cheating on her.

55

Apparently he begged me to take a picture of his face.

56

But my senior is a serious person.

64
00:04:22,997 --> 00:04:26,934
There's no way she would invite someone else's husband or something like that.

(Ryo) Huh? >>But I can't hear you very well.

109
00:07:39,493 --> 00:07:42,429
Is it because that woman posted about Ryo on Instagram?

00:07:42,496 --> 00:07:45,432
(Ryo) Why do you mean that... >> Hey, Ryo-kun.

111
00:07:45,499 --> 00:07:49,436

117
00:08:03,951 --> 00:08:06,887
I was told the conditions for continuing the relationship.

118
00:08:06,954 --> 00:08:09,890
Did he do that to that woman?

119
00:08:09,957 --> 00:08:12,960
Hey, did your wife say something?

120
00:08:14,962 --> 00:08:17,397
Come to think of it, my eye was seriously injured.

121
00:08:17,464 --> 00:08:19,399
(Ryo) Nagi-chan?

122
00:08:19,466 --> 00:08:21,401
>> Is that all for writing in a novel?

00:08:21,468 --> 00:08:25,405
I told you before that that's why I'm doing this.

00:08:25,472 --> 00:08:29,409
Anyway, I don't want to be left out of this relationship.

125
00:08:29,476 --> 00:08:33,981
Ryo-kun, please tell your wife that you are following the rules properly.

00:09:11,451 --> 00:09:13,887
I see.

137
00:09:13,954 --> 00:09:18,392
(Kuwabara) Eh, now Yajima, what did you say?

138
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:22,396
📱(Nagiko) This is Risa Yajima, and that person was making a fuss.

00:09:25,465 --> 00:09:29,469

senior.

00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:37,411
This is an event report →

143
00:09:37,477 --> 00:09:39,913
I'll write that down well.

144
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:42,416
(Risa) Oshima-chan, report what you see.

145
00:09:42,482 --> 00:09:45,919
>> But if you do that, your senior's personnel evaluation will be affected...

146
00:09:45,986 --> 00:09:50,424
However, the power harassment incident caused the situation to decline.

147
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:53,994
(Lisa) It's my responsibility, so don't worry about it.

148
00:09:55,996 --> 00:10:01,435
>> I also bear the responsibility of teasing my senior at that time.

149
00:10:01,501 --> 00:10:03,937
[I think seniors are also cheating.]

150
00:10:04,004 --> 00:10:05,939
[Is there anyone nearby? ]

151
00:10:06,006 --> 00:10:08,508
[This is the person I would like to meet as soon as possible]

152
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:12,946
Therefore, senior →

153
00:10:13,013 --> 00:10:15,449
Please tell me I won't see you again.

154
00:10:15,515 --> 00:10:20,520
(Lisa) It's really not a strange relationship.

155
00:10:25,025 --> 00:10:26,960
>>Senior.

156
00:10:27,027 --> 00:10:29,963
Every year I send them more than I can eat →

157
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:32,466
Hey, take it, take it.

158
00:10:32,532 --> 00:10:35,969
Ah, Yajima-san, here's a souvenir for your husband.

159
00:10:36,036 --> 00:10:38,472
(Lisa) No, it's fine.

160
00:10:38,538 --> 00:10:42,976
>> I heard that you had an argument with the wife of the person you were having an affair with during the event, Mr. Yajima.

161
00:10:43,043 --> 00:10:46,480
Complaints are even coming to our center →

162
00:10:46,546 --> 00:10:49,483
Was there much of a fuss?

163
00:10:49,549 --> 00:10:52,486
(Lisa) The person who came to say that is not a sane person.

164
00:10:52,552 --> 00:10:55,989
I haven't committed adultery.

165
00:10:56,056 --> 00:10:57,991
>> What are you talking about?

166
00:10:58,058 --> 00:11:00,494
No one cares whether you did or not.

167
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,930
Because it's the same as my power harassment.

168
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:06,933
(Lisa) Huh? >> You compiled the testimony →

169
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,935
That power harassment.

170
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:13,440
No matter how much I try to explain, “I didn’t do that, it was just for education.”→

171
00:11:13,507 --> 00:11:16,443
Don't you remember that it didn't make any sense?

172
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:20,947
Don't waste your energy on meaningless things.

173
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:25,952
Suspicions never stop following me →

174
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:28,955
Yeah, because it won't end.

175
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:33,460
(Lisa) 《Your power harassment was not a suspicion》

176
00:11:33,527 --> 00:11:36,963
“It was a far cry from education.”

177
