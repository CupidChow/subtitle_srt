(Risa) If you think about it calmly, Takahisa is the one.

181
00:11:27,521 --> 00:11:29,456
(Takaku) Risa!

182
00:11:29,523 --> 00:11:32,526
I'll never break up with you! (sound of door closing)

183

(Oshima) Please excuse me. (Kuwabara) Please.

184

(Oshima) Thank you for waiting.

185
00:11:38,532 --> 00:11:41,968
(Kuwabara) Mr. Meguro, please call our department.

186
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:44,971
You said you want to cancel your insurance.

187
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:46,973
Cancellation?

188
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,977
(Hideaki) I'm sorry, but my mother has recently started suffering from dementia.

189
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:53,980
It seems like I signed up for insurance on my own.

190
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:58,485
Ah, I see, if I accept the procedure...

191
00:11:58,552 --> 00:12:02,923
Well, I can't check the progress of the contract.

192
00:12:02,989 --> 00:12:05,425

193

194
00:12:12,499 --> 00:12:14,434
Who is in charge of me?

195
00:12:14,501 --> 00:12:16,503
It's Yajima.

196
00:12:18,004 --> 00:12:20,440
(Kuwabara) Well, I wonder where it went.

197
00:12:20,507 --> 00:12:23,009
Meguro's 10 million.

198
00:12:24,511 --> 00:12:28,448
(Kuwabara) Mr. Yajima, you seem to be busy lately.

199
00:12:28,515 --> 00:12:30,951
The wife of that adulterous partner →

200
00:12:31,017 --> 00:12:34,454
I heard you bought 100 million yen in life insurance just before you died?

201
00:12:34,521 --> 00:12:37,958
That's an unnatural story.

202
00:12:38,024 --> 00:12:42,462
Mr. Oshima knows something, right?

203
00:12:42,529 --> 00:12:45,465
I don't have anything else.

204
00:12:45,532 --> 00:12:48,468
You met Yajima-san's husband, right?

205
00:12:48,535 --> 00:12:50,470
Why that?

206
00:12:50,537 --> 00:12:54,474
In the unlikely event that there is a compliance violation in the course of business →

207
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:57,978
I will hold you responsible as well as Yajima.

208
00:12:58,044 --> 00:13:00,480
If he knew and was hiding it, he would be guilty of the same crime.

209
00:13:00,547 --> 00:13:04,918
I'll do anything to destroy you guys.

210
00:13:04,985 --> 00:13:07,420
It's a long-standing grudge.

211
00:13:07,487 --> 00:13:09,422
For many years.

212
00:13:09,489 --> 00:13:12,926
Mr. Kuwabara, don't you have a bit of a grudge against him?

213
00:13:12,993 --> 00:13:14,928
It is natural to report harassment...

214
00:13:14,995 --> 00:13:17,430
That's right, it's a grudge!

215
00:13:17,497 --> 00:13:19,933
Do you know how much humiliation I suffered?

216
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,437
They were taken off the career path, had their backs pointed at them, and ended up getting divorced.

217
00:13:24,504 --> 00:13:27,440
But it's all my fault, right?

218
00:13:27,507 --> 00:13:29,943
So what can we do about bad guys?

219
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:32,946
It would have been better if you had told me directly instead of making accusations.

220
00:13:33,013 --> 00:13:35,949
Why did I serve the company for over 20 years?

221
00:13:36,016 --> 00:13:37,951
Just because I hurt your mood a few years after I joined →

222
00:13:38,018 --> 00:13:39,953

How much grudge will I hold towards you?

224
00:13:42,522 --> 00:13:44,457
Didn't you think about it?

225
00:13:44,524 --> 00:13:47,027
I guess you haven't even thought about it!

226
00:13:52,532 --> 00:13:55,969
