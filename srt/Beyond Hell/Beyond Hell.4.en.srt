4
00:00:26,527 --> 00:00:29,029

5
00:00:31,532 --> 00:00:33,968
(Male) Aro-san, right?

6
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:37,972
Aha ratio.

7
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:42,476
(Kanako) Hi, I am a beauty doctor who specializes in beautiful skin.

8
00:00:42,543 --> 00:00:45,980
Well, it's a business if you don't do something about it.

9
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:50,484
But Aro is also very beautiful.

10
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:53,487
Hey, do you like "Home Alone"?

11
00:00:53,554 --> 00:00:55,489
“Home Alone”?

12
00:00:55,556 --> 00:00:57,992
The doctor likes “Home Alone” →

13
00:00:58,058 --> 00:00:59,994
Isn't it cute?

14
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:03,497
I'm weak at that kind of thing.

20

What do you mean?

21
00:01:24,518 --> 00:01:26,954

Well, say something.

24
00:01:32,526 --> 00:01:35,963
Eh, you're trying to get pregnant, right?

25
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:37,965
This is against the rules!

26
00:01:38,032 --> 00:01:40,468
Ah, it's so noisy!

27
00:01:40,534 --> 00:01:43,971
Even if I could, I wouldn't cause you the slightest bit of trouble.

28
00:01:44,038 --> 00:01:48,476
Gyaaaaaaaaaah, don't make a fuss, you ultra-fine pencil man!

We will provide you with Chinese herbal medicine containing nutrients and herbal medicines such as Angelica.

37
00:02:14,001 --> 00:02:17,438
Aren't I having irregular periods?

38
00:02:17,505 --> 00:02:21,442
That's why my husband doesn't cooperate with the treatment at all, even though he has few seeds.

39
00:02:21,509 --> 00:02:23,444
(Monitor) Ah haa...｡

40
00:02:23,511 --> 00:02:28,449
It's so troublesome, I wonder what all this is about.

41
00:02:28,516 --> 00:02:30,951
Lately, it's been noisy even at my husband's parents' house.

42
00:02:31,018 --> 00:02:32,953
(Shoya) What? this.

43
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:35,956
Ah, my mother-in-law sent it to me.

44
00:02:36,023 --> 00:02:37,958
(Shoya) I thought so.

45
00:02:38,025 --> 00:02:39,960
Send back something so blatant.

46
00:02:40,027 --> 00:02:42,963
Eh, it's okay, you don't have to go that far.

47
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:45,466
It's just water, let's drink it.

48
00:02:45,533 --> 00:02:47,968
(Shoya) Don't fall for this trick.

49
00:02:48,035 --> 00:02:50,971
They're telling me to give birth to a successor to the hospital.

50
00:02:51,038 --> 00:02:53,474
It's the old days in my head.

51
00:02:53,541 --> 00:02:55,976
Because my brother only gave birth to a female →

52
00:02:56,043 --> 00:02:58,479
Now you're trying to get me to do something.

53
00:02:58,546 --> 00:03:01,482
Listen, let's try to wag our tails at least a little bit at those guys.

54
00:03:01,549 --> 00:03:03,417
Because it's an immediate divorce.

55
00:03:03,484 --> 00:03:05,419
I understand.

56
00:03:05,486 --> 00:03:08,422
Who will have children for them?

57
00:03:08,489 --> 00:03:12,426
But I'm simple, so I'll take this opportunity to...

58
00:03:12,493 --> 00:03:14,428
I would be happy if you could go with me to the hospital.

59
00:03:14,495 --> 00:03:16,931
What's the point of forcing yourself to make something?

60
00:03:16,997 --> 00:03:19,433
They're just being used by their parents.

61
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:22,436
We need to protect it so that this doesn't happen.

62
00:03:22,503 --> 00:03:24,939
Are you so stupid that you forgot?

63
00:03:25,005 --> 00:03:27,942
How much did they make a fool of me?

64
00:03:28,008 --> 00:03:31,445
They told me to my face that I was a vulgar person with no academic background.

65
00:03:31,512 --> 00:03:34,448
But it's almost true.

66
00:03:34,515 --> 00:03:37,451
that's why….

67
00:03:37,518 --> 00:03:41,956
Ah, I should have at least married a woman who could use her brain.

68
00:03:42,022 --> 00:03:46,961
Hey, Ma-kun, why don't you think about this and that separately?

69
00:03:47,027 --> 00:03:49,964
Don't make it sound like I'm particular about it.

70
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:54,468
Hey, that's the one that's involved.

71
00:03:54,535 --> 00:03:57,471
You should give up already.

72
00:03:57,538 --> 00:03:59,974
It can't be helped if it doesn't come naturally.

73
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:03,978
If you're going to hate it, hate your own body.

77
00:04:19,994 --> 00:04:22,930
It's really twisted and troublesome.

78
00:04:22,997 --> 00:04:27,434
But, well, I'm married to your money.

79
00:04:27,501 --> 00:04:29,436
Ryo-kun too, right?

80
00:04:29,503 --> 00:04:32,439
You got married because your wife is rich, right?

81
00:04:32,506 --> 00:04:34,942
(Ryo) I...

82
00:04:35,009 --> 00:04:37,945

83

85
00:04:43,017 --> 00:04:44,952
Ryo was beaten by his wife.

86
00:04:45,019 --> 00:04:48,522
But you're trying your best to endure it, right?

87
00:04:50,024 --> 00:04:51,458
(Ryo) Well.

88
00:04:51,525 --> 00:04:54,528
>> Go ahead and change your clothes.

89
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:07,408
Come to think of it, what happened with that person earlier?

90
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:08,909
(Ryo) The person from earlier?

91
00:05:08,976 --> 00:05:11,412
>> He's from my apartment, right?

92
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:14,415
I've known him for a year or two.

93
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:18,419
Every time I see something about that person, I get irritated.

94
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:22,923
Is it because it feels classy?

95
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:24,925
(Ryo) You said you knew it from before, how come?

96
00:05:24,992 --> 00:05:28,929
>> No, it's just that we ran into each other in the apartment.

97
00:05:28,996 --> 00:05:31,432
So what happened? With that person.

98
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:33,934
(Ryo) Nothing. >> Lie.

99
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:36,003
(Ryo) There's really nothing.

100
00:05:40,007 --> 00:05:42,943
>> Then can we talk about me?

101

>> Hahaha Hey Ryo-kun.

104
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:58,459
It's a joke, so don't make that face. I won't say it.

105
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:00,461
If I say that, my wife will get mad at me.

106
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:04,465
I want to continue my relationship with Ryo-kun.

107
