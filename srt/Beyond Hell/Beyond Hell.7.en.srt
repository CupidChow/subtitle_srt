>> I was the one who was hurt by Ryo!

182
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:19,366
That's why I hurt you too.

183
00:13:19,432 --> 00:13:21,368
Only when it hurts →

184
00:13:21,434 --> 00:13:24,938
Because I can trust that you're not lying.

185
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:31,378
(Lisa) I was hurt or deceived →

186

You're all about yourself.

187
00:13:34,881 --> 00:13:38,818
You've never thought about other people's feelings.

188
00:13:38,885 --> 00:13:42,822
I think it's okay because I'm different from other people.

189
00:13:42,889 --> 00:13:46,326
That's why I can't understand anyone.

190

Just let him go.

191
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:57,837

192
00:13:57,904 --> 00:14:00,840
You need me, right?

193
00:14:00,907 --> 00:14:03,843
In order to continue this gym.

194
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:05,845
(Risa) Something like that kind of threat...

195
00:14:05,912 --> 00:14:09,349

(Ryo) I...

200

>> You're just like my Ma-kun.

201
00:14:25,432 --> 00:14:27,867
I think if I bring up money, they will listen to what I have to say.

202
00:14:27,934 --> 00:14:32,372
You hear me, you married money.

203

surely.

204
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:37,878
But even such a woman knows Ryo-kun that you don't know.

205
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:41,815
Ryou and I met outside.

206
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,817

>> Something's bothering me.

208
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,821
Did we meet outside?

209
00:14:47,888 --> 00:14:49,322
(Ryo) I haven't met you.

210
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:52,826
>> I came here to get allergy medicine, Ryo-kun.

211
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:56,329
(Ryo) Kanade-san! >> We met by chance at the general hospital.

212
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:59,899
When Ryo-kun was injured and was absent from the gym.

213
00:15:01,902 --> 00:15:04,838
(Nagiko's voice) The day I went to pick up medicine...

214

215
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:10,343
I went to a nearby hotel.

216
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:15,415
What can I say, Ryo is like you when you're not here...

217
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:19,853
It was extremely lewd...

218
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:22,856
I'll just say.

219
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:28,428

220
00:15:30,931 --> 00:15:35,302
I lied and betrayed you again!

221
00:15:35,368 --> 00:15:37,804
(Ryo) It's because Nagi-chan hurts things like this!

222

223

229
00:15:55,388 --> 00:15:57,324

231
