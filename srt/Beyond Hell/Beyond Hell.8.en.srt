(Risa) [Takaku is also guilty of the same crime.]

176
00:11:34,528 --> 00:11:38,465
[A relationship that continues without destroying the family]

177
00:11:38,532 --> 00:11:40,967
(Takaku) I admit it.

178
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:43,970
A matching app for married people called OP →

179
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:46,473
I met some people.

180
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:48,475
After realizing that, Risa went with him...

181
00:11:48,542 --> 00:11:50,977
(Risa) Stop it, it's too late. (Takahisa) I know it's too late.

182
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:52,979
But I...

183
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:56,483
(Lisa) The other person is that...

184
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:59,052
Who is Kanade?

185
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:05,492
(Lisa) I could hear the conversation when I came to the hospital.

186
00:12:08,995 --> 00:12:12,933
(Lisa) I've been seeing that person for a long time, haven't I?

187
00:12:12,999 --> 00:12:17,437
Where? Love hotel?

188
00:12:17,504 --> 00:12:20,941
Or in this apartment?

189
00:12:21,007 --> 00:12:23,443
Takaku is also horrifying!

190
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:26,446
(Takaku) But I don't let people die.

191
00:12:26,513 --> 00:12:28,448
I didn't even know how to play, so I ran forward →

192
00:12:28,515 --> 00:12:31,017
I'm not the one who pushed someone to the point of death.

193
00:12:33,019 --> 00:12:34,521
It's Lisa.

194
00:12:38,024 --> 00:12:40,961
(Takaku) That's why I told you to stop.

195
00:12:41,027 --> 00:12:43,029
What should I do when something like this happens?

196
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:46,533
What can you do for me?

197
00:12:50,537 --> 00:12:52,973
(loud)

198
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:57,477
(Mita) That's why it's no joke that a lump-sum fee is collected for that purpose!

199
00:12:57,544 --> 00:12:59,980
\That's right, don't be silly/

200
00:13:00,046 --> 00:13:02,983
(Mita) Yajima-san, why don't you say something?

201
00:13:03,049 --> 00:13:05,986
Even you know the cause.

202
00:13:06,052 --> 00:13:10,056
What kind of nerve does it have to have an affair between residents?

203
00:13:17,564 --> 00:13:20,500
I totally understand how you feel →

204
00:13:20,567 --> 00:13:23,003
Once you start pursuing something like that, it gets long →

205
00:13:23,069 --> 00:13:25,005
Can't we just move on?

206
00:13:25,071 --> 00:13:29,009
Is your home okay? Husband: It's going to be tough because of the lawsuit, isn't it?

207
00:13:29,075 --> 00:13:34,014
Don't worry, my family is a big family so I can afford to deal with it.

208
00:13:42,522 --> 00:13:44,524
Don't wait.

209
00:13:49,529 --> 00:13:51,965
(Lisa) Did your husband contact you?

210
00:13:52,032 --> 00:13:53,967
>> Husband?

211
00:13:54,034 --> 00:13:57,971
Oh, did you find out?

212
00:13:58,038 --> 00:14:00,540
(Lisa) Well then, please excuse me.

213
00:14:02,542 --> 00:14:04,544
>> Hey, give me 1 million yen.

214
00:14:06,546 --> 00:14:08,982
(Lisa) Yes?

215
00:14:09,049 --> 00:14:10,984
>> You got it, right?

216
00:14:11,051 --> 00:14:15,055
I have a lot of stories about you.

217
00:14:16,556 --> 00:14:18,491
(Lisa) Are you threatening me?

218
00:14:18,558 --> 00:14:22,495
>> Hey, did that person really commit suicide?

219
00:14:22,562 --> 00:14:26,499
Have you ever had someone say something really terrible to you?

220
00:14:26,566 --> 00:14:29,569
(Lisa) [Gone, disappeared]

221
00:14:32,572 --> 00:14:37,444
>>Try saying that to Ryo-kun the next time you flirt.

222
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:39,946
(Lisa) Are we still seeing each other?

223
00:14:40,013 --> 00:14:42,449
>> He's my wife's official mistress.

224
00:14:42,515 --> 00:14:46,453
I need to give you lots of comfort now.

225
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:48,021
(sound of slapping cheek)

226
00:14:49,022 --> 00:14:50,957
(sound of slapping cheek)

227
00:14:51,024 --> 00:14:53,960
If you want me to disappear, prepare 1 million yen.

228
00:14:54,027 --> 00:14:56,963
As I said, we have an open marriage.

229
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:59,532
No matter what you say to your husband, it's useless.

230
00:15:08,475 --> 00:15:10,477
(Oshima) Did you have a will?

231
00:15:12,479 --> 00:15:15,415
(Oshima) This is the will of the deceased Nagiko Jouchi.

232
00:15:15,482 --> 00:15:17,917
Was there?

233
00:15:17,984 --> 00:15:21,921
(Lisa) Sorry, what are you talking about...

234
00:15:21,988 --> 00:15:23,923
>> This is my wife who came to the event.

235
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:28,928
After that, he came to me and signed a whole life insurance contract.

236
00:15:28,995 --> 00:15:34,434
Do you remember? That's what my wife said at that time.

237
00:15:34,501 --> 00:15:38,438
[I'll make sure my money doesn't go to Ryo]

238
00:15:38,505 --> 00:15:40,940
[Because I had an affair→

239
00:15:41,007 --> 00:15:44,010
Of course there is a penalty, right?

240
00:15:45,512 --> 00:15:47,947
(Lisa) Did you really do that?

241
00:15:48,014 --> 00:15:52,519
>> It was a 100 million yen contract with my father as the beneficiary.

242
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:56,389
(Lisa) But in this case...

243
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:59,893
>> Yes, he died by suicide soon after joining →

244
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:02,395
The contract will become invalid.

245
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:05,899
The 100 million yen will be returned to the policyholder.

246
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:08,902
Because it will be distributed as an inheritance along with other assets →

247
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,904
It will also fall into the hands of that husband.

248
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,907
But there should be a will.

249
00:16:13,974 --> 00:16:17,410
When we signed the contract, my wife said she would write it.

250
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:20,413
To remove my husband as an heir.

251
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,416
Haven't you heard? Nothing.

252
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:26,419
(Lisa) I don't know.

253
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:28,922
Because I haven't met him.

254
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:31,925
>> It's okay, right?

255
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:34,994
That husband isn't going to receive the money, right?

256
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:38,431
(Lisa) I don't know, but...

257
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:42,936
>> You're a sinner, you let your wife die.

258
00:16:43,003 --> 00:16:45,505
It would be strange not to receive a penalty.

259
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:52,946
(Ryo) As expected, it wasn't there.

260
00:16:53,013 --> 00:16:56,449
(Kazuhiro) Let me look for this room as well.

261
00:16:58,451 --> 00:17:00,387
(Ryo) That father-in-law.

262
00:17:00,453 --> 00:17:02,889
The police were searching there just now.

263
00:17:02,956 --> 00:17:04,891
There was no will.

264
00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:08,895
>>What I'm looking for is an official will.

265
00:17:08,962 --> 00:17:10,897
(Cool) A suicide note?

266
00:17:10,964 --> 00:17:14,401
>> Once you have property, decide where it will go →

267
00:17:14,467 --> 00:17:17,404
I taught that child to write down things.

268
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:19,906
It's strange that there's nothing.

269
00:17:19,973 --> 00:17:22,475
(Ryo) But there's really nothing there...｡

270
00:17:28,481 --> 00:17:32,919
>>I hear you were hitting Nagiko.

271
00:17:32,986 --> 00:17:35,922
(Ryo) Are you talking about that bruise on your face?

272
00:17:35,989 --> 00:17:38,925
I didn't do anything...I didn't hit him.

273
00:17:38,992 --> 00:17:41,928
>>That's why I was against marriage from the beginning.

274
00:17:41,995 --> 00:17:44,931
Nagiko's property is legally →

275
00:17:44,998 --> 00:17:48,435
It will be divided between you and our parents.

276
00:17:48,501 --> 00:17:52,939
But as a parent →

277
00:17:53,006 --> 00:17:54,874
I don't want to give it to you.

278
00:17:54,941 --> 00:17:57,444
I will stop it even if I go to court.

279
00:17:59,446 --> 00:18:01,448
And...

280
00:18:04,451 --> 00:18:07,387
If you hide your will→

281
00:18:07,454 --> 00:18:11,958

290
00:19:06,446 --> 00:19:08,448
(Lisa) Liangjun.

291
00:19:12,452 --> 00:19:15,388
(Ryo) I was isolated because I was sick.

292

I will pass it on to other children.

Nagi-chan.

295

(Lisa) When did you say that?

296
00:19:36,476 --> 00:19:38,978
(Ryo) Probably just before he died.

297
00:19:41,981 --> 00:19:45,418

(Ryo) It's me.

301
00:19:57,430 --> 00:20:02,368
Nagi-chan's father-in-law thinks it's because I hit her.

302

But that facial injury is →

303

Deliberately hit it somewhere.

305
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:21,888
Just because of that, no one will believe anything I say.

306
00:20:21,955 --> 00:20:26,392
At that time, I was too scared to ask Nagi-chan.
