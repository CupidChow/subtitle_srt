1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:07,970


2
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:35,070
 Today's Webtoon 

3
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:46,760
 Can't we stay together forever? 

4
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:49,720
 You're just like my long running dream. 

5
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:01,950
Noona, I told you to come out.

6
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:05,460
Are you reading cartoons again?

7
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:07,270
I'm done.

8
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,200
Let's go. Let's go, let's go!

9
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,930
Let's go.

10
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:15,930
 Episode 7: You're just like my long running dream. 

11
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:20,370
 You're just like my long-running dream. 

12
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:42,400
Artist Dong Hui? Artist Dong Hui!

13
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:48,400
- PD On!
 - My goodness, can't believe I'm seeing you here.

14
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,660
So, do you run every weekend?

15
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:53,520
No. I run every day.

16
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,400
- Every day?
 - Yes.

17
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,510
On weekdays, I just run around my neighborhood.

18
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:59,690
But since it's the weekend, I came out to the Han River.

19
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:02,160
What brings you here, Artist Dong Hui?

20
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,830
I came out to take some background reference photos early in the morning

21
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:06,980
and thought I'd watch the sunrise.

22
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:09,360
You take your own background reference photos?

23
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,770
Yes, I still like taking my photos and drawing from them.

24
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:15,220
As expected. You're amazing.

25
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:17,200
Gosh, no, I'm not amazing.

26
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,300
I've been an assistant artist for ten years and still preparing for a competition.

27
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:22,480
Don't say stuff like that.

28
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:26,640
You always keep things centered at Artist Baek Eo Jin's studio.

29
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,830
You have no idea how reliable you are.

30
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:32,240
Your diligent work ethic will pay off for sure.

31
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,020
By chance,

32
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:40,590
could you take a look at my work sometime?

33
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:43,860
I'd like to get some feedback before I submit it to the competition.

34
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:47,120
Gosh, I'm not sure if I could be of any help.

35
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,770
But I still look forward to your work with much curiosity, Artist Dong Hui.

36
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:53,510
Gosh, thank you for even saying that.

37
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:56,490
- It's my honor.
 - Same for me.

38
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:14,640
 An aspiring cartoon artist, 10 years in the works. 

39
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:20,600
 From a place that is too familiar to me, would I be able to get out this time? 

40
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:31,230
Hyeong, you can do this, right?

41
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:33,930
Just don't get nervous. Don't get nervous. Just do what you usually do.

42
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:35,730
Got it?

43
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:37,790
I'll go with a fighting spirit.

44
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:45,750
Hyeong, fighting! Fighting!

45
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,400
 The door is closing. 

46
00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:00,610
 PD Jang Hye Mi 

47
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:11,160
CEO... please don't remove Webtoon from the homepage.

48
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:16,030
You know how much the presence on the homepage affects the number of clicks.

49
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:21,380
All the team leaders from different service departments request to be present on the homepage.

50
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:26,320
And I have to apply the standard in the midst of all that.

51
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:34,750
Not much is left of the time you and I have agreed upon.

52
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:38,670
Please give us full support for the remaining time

53
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:43,430
so that there are no regrets for you and me both.

54
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,570
You're back.

55
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:59,390
Jun Yeong. Let us three meet.

56
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:03,350
Yes, come to the conference room.

57
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:19,660
Sin Dae Ryuk. You have to redo the work you just sent me.

58
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:21,410
How come?

59
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:24,240
Come look.

60
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:29,510
The perspective is off.

61
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:33,900
If you draw a center line across with your eye level at the soldiers,

62
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:38,660
the soldiers should look bigger, and the horse should look smaller.

63
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:41,380
But why should I do that?

64
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:45,700
You can feel more of the threat if you draw it like this.

65
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:52,950
In any case, redraw it.

66
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:54,540
Okay.

67
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:04,290
 He doesn't have any experience of learning from anyone else, 

68
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:08,230
 but he already knew how to use cartoon dramaturgy. 

69
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:17,280
 Regarding homepage redesign 

70
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:23,340
Write up a report on the reason why Webtoon should not be removed from here.

71
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:29,670
Your specialty is data analysis and service planning.

72
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:33,320
It has to be good enough to convince Director Heo.

73
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:37,130
It will be a great help if you help, Jun Yeong.

74
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:40,580
 The current webtoon team will vanish. 

75
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:41,870
 You know YoungToon, right? 

76
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:43,580
 They are number one in the industry. 

77
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:45,770
 We are planning to acquire that company. 

78
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:48,070
Jun Yeong, please do your best this time.

79
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:50,040
I'll treat you to good food.

80
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,870
I have lunch plans. I'll go ahead. Enjoy your lunch.

81
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:54,600
- Okay. 
- I have plans, too.

82
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,410
Enjoy!

83
00:06:56,410 --> 00:06:58,840
Why don't we go eat then?

84
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:01,380
- Yes.
 - Let's go.

85
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,320
Jun Yeong, aren't you going?

86
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,530
- Coming. 
 - If we want galbitang  (braised rib soup) , it's that way.

87
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:13,980
- No. 
 -  I'm fine with any soup. 

88
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:15,580
 PD Jang Hye Mi 
 - Then I want to eat instant tteokbokki. (spicy rice cake) 

89
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:17,390
Out of the blue?

90
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:20,670
It's so good if you fry rice with it.

91
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:22,860
You're so mean.

92
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:37,250
So, who is that woman?

93
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:39,070
We worked together at GingerToon for a long time.

94
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:41,240
She's the deputy editor at YoungToon.

95
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,260
I see.

96
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:46,410
If they stayed together, they'd have been a deputy editor couple.

97
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:48,420
They were together?

98
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:51,720
It was a long time ago. A while ago.

99
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,760
I see...

100
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:56,070
So, why did you come here?

101
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:57,540
I came to eat.

102
00:07:57,540 --> 00:08:00,330
Don't play with words.

103
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:02,830
You're still as boring as ever.

104
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:08,780
Did you already sign on all the artists you discovered at the Webtoon camp?

105
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,900
Yeah. Just the people we need.

106
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,610
I see.

107
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:14,720
I see that you're quite interested in our company.

108
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,740
Of course. You're our competitor.

109
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:19,960
You should show your interest in YoungToon, too, Sunbae.

110
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:22,260
Why wouldn't I be interested? I'm very much interested.

111
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:23,870
As you said, you're our competitor.

112
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:25,530
I'm always watching you guys.

113
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:27,530
Then let's connect often.

114
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:30,560
We can share information, too.

115
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:35,500
Well, we're not exactly in a relationship...

116
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,730
to connect often, right?

117
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:41,290
You're still as old-fashioned as ever.

118
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:45,830
Are you uncomfortable around me?

119
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:48,780
Yeah.

120
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,740
Get used to it.

121
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:55,450
I'll call you if I have any questions from now on

122
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:59,230
and I'll come to see you if I miss you.

123
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:03,000
See you again.

124
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:17,080
Enjoy your lunch.

125
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,230
I took care of the bill.

126
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:21,540
You didn't have to do that.

127
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:24,650
Thank you.

128
00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:27,540
 Neon, On Ma Eum, Webtoon Service 

129
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:31,320
I'll see you around.

130
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:35,990
I almost choked on my food.

131
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:37,720
It was your idea to come here.

132
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:40,170
Don't decide on restaurants from now on.

133
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:51,220
PD Ma Eum!

134
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:53,730
Artist Dong Hui!

135
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:55,080
What brings you here?

136
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:58,160
Are you here to see Artist Baek or Artist Sin Dae Ryuk?

137
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,210
I came to see you, Artist Dong Hui.

138
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:01,980
Me?

139
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:05,120
Oh! About that thing I had mentioned?

140
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:11,370
I wanted to meet Artist Baek, Artist Sin Dae Ryuk, and also you.

141
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:13,800
I came to see all of you.

142
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:20,030
Did you have lunch?

143
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:22,170
Oh, not yet.

144
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:24,450
- You must be starving. 
- Yes.

145
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:26,680
Did you take background reference photos today, too?

146
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,910
Yes. How did you know?

147
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:30,290
Did you eat kimbap again?

148
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:32,110
How did you know that?

149
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:35,850
 Publishing Rights for Cartoon "Eye of the Dragon" 

150
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:42,110
You can send a courier next time.

151
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:43,880
Gosh, no.

152
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,600
I'm your fan, Artist Baek.

153
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,810
I love it because I can see you one more time, thanks to this paperwork.

154
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:54,160
Well... is Artist Sin Dae Ryuk doing okay?

155
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:57,780
He's keeping up with things better than I thought.

156
00:10:58,430 --> 00:11:05,600
But I heard you strongly recommended Sin Dae Ryuk's work.

157
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,130
Yes.

158
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:10,150
What was the attraction to his work?

159
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:12,180
It was...

160
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:16,320
just fun.

161
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:20,760
I guess you could say I wanted to find out how the story ended.

162
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,830
That's the most important factor.

163
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:29,490
You have a great instincts as a PD.

164
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:31,570
Really?

165
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:34,000
Thank you for saying that.

166
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,780
Here you go.

167
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:40,190
Thank you for this meal.

168
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:42,680
It's not much, but please enjoy.

169
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:45,500
Not much? This is a feast!

170
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,370
Because Madam's cooking is so wonderful,

171
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:49,490
I haven't been able to leave for ten years now.

172
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:54,170
The reason I couldn't make my debut is because of this delicious food.

173
00:11:57,870 --> 00:12:00,570
Do you need something?

174
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:14,370
Sin Dae Ryuk.

175
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:27,840
I'll be right back.

176
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,590
Are you all right?

177
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:33,340
Yes...

178
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:44,430
Sin Dae Ryuk, what's wrong?

179
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,160
Why did you do that all of a sudden?

180
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,430
Madam is a nice person.

181
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:51,460
I know.

182
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:54,000
I know, but

183
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,750
I don't like being touched.

184
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:03,490
Especially... a woman touching me...

185
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:05,910
It's hard for me to even be next to them.

186
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:07,540
How about PD On Ma Eum?

187
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:09,260
You get along well with PD On.

188
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:11,660
You eat together and talk a lot.

189
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:13,780
PD On is not a woman.

190
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:17,650
Hey, h-how can you say such a rude thing?

191
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:21,400
She's a god... to me.

192
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,590
A god?

193
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:28,020
She recognized my talent and discovered me.

194
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:30,000
A god.

195
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:38,190
Did something happen at the studio?

196
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:40,810
I thought you'd be angry.

197
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:45,040
I don't think you'd behave that way without a reason.

198
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:54,440
If you have any issues at work,

199
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,770
be sure to tell me.

200
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:01,220
Okay.

201
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:04,760
 An ambitious new work by Artist Oh Yun. 

202
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,190
 "Origin of Mankind." 

203
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:08,980
 Stuck deep down in the underground... 

204
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:11,920
 - no matter how much...  
- Geez, seriously!

205
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,300
D*** it! I won't let this go. S***!

206
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:17,170
 - And into the ocean, gosh... 
 - What's wrong?

207
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:20,270
I guess Webtoon Witch is trashtalking "Origin of Mankind."

208
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:22,550
Geez, you Webtoon Witch!

209
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:24,570
She has more subscribers lately, and

210
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:27,940
She's been totally lashing out. 
 It's no fun and not emotionally moving, either 

211
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:29,960
I know how you feel. I've been through it.

212
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:34,440
Hey, Du Hui, if you're that stressed out about it, wrap it up quickly!

213
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:37,060
So frustrating. Really!

214
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:39,390
I'm going to get them!

215
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:40,830
I should shove this burger down their... ugh!

216
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:43,190
 It's so obvious! 

217
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:45,960
 The earth will be destroyed by crashing into a planet, 

218
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,520
 the webtoon will also be destroyed, 

219
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:50,950
 and Artist Oh Yun is ruined, too. 

220
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:57,900
 I mean, if it's not better than his comedic work, 

221
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:00,530
 why does he keep dragging it on? 

222
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:03,580
 I just don't get it. 

223
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:08,340
 By chance, is Artist Oh Yun... 

224
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:11,660
I have a huge number of clicks this month.

225
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:12,770
Whoa!

226
00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:13,530
   

227
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:16,960
 The next episode will be even more brutal. 

228
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,960
 Webtoon Witch 
The next episode will be even more brutal. 

229
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:25,460
It looks like you drew it with your foot.

230
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:27,380
- Mind your own business.
 - Hey!

231
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:28,990
Hey, Gang Nam!

232
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:31,290
We're in Gang Buk right now.
  (Gang Buk: North of Han River. Gang Nam means south of Han River.) 

233
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:32,950
I told you to stop that.

234
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:34,240
What's with that...

235
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,430
Hey, stop acting like the star.

236
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:38,050
You always show up last.

237
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:39,510
You think I want to show up late?

238
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:42,980
I barely made it here to see you guys while losing sleep, trying to make my deadlines, man.

239
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:45,050
You don't think we have deadlines?

240
00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:47,750
We're just not as successful. We're working nonstop, too.

241
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:49,880
You said you finished your series not too long ago.

242
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:52,270
- I started a new title. 
 - Already another one?

243
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:54,600
If you sit on new ideas for too long these days,

244
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,750
it goes out of style in no time.

245
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,640
The world changes every second nowadays.

246
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,470
Well, y-yeah, th-that's true.

247
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:02,520
What do you have to worry about?

248
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:06,180
You can take Gumiho Princess for the rest of your life.

249
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:08,240
I'm so envious.

250
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,170
Hey, listen. I have a new idea.

251
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:13,890
There's this person on the autism spectrum.

252
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:27,740
 Mom 

253
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:29,380
Is everything okay?

254
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:31,820
Oh, w-well, it's the same old.

255
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:34,810
It shouldn't be the same old for you!

256
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:37,180
- What? 
 -  It's been ten years already. 

257
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:40,020
 How much longer will you do that? 

258
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:44,570
If you can't debut this year, come back home.

259
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:46,760
 Your dad is old now. 

260
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,360
I'm almost there.

261
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:51,090
If I quit now, what about everything I've done till now?

262
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:52,610
Are you sure you're almost there?

263
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:53,790
Are you sure?

264
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:56,770
 You said the same thing last year and year before that. 

265
00:16:56,770 --> 00:16:58,420
 Geez! 

266
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:16,970
 I might get one chance just like Sin Dae Ryuk. 

267
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:20,980
 I hope she will be my god as well. 

268
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:26,490
 PD On, as we discussed last time, 

269
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:29,640
 would you be able to review my work? 

270
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:44,300
Artist!

271
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:57,690
Whoa... your worldview is very solid.

272
00:17:57,690 --> 00:17:59,880
Your drawing style is so cute.

273
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:02,580
It's such quality work. Why are you submitting it to Papaya?

274
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:04,880
Why, why, why not to us?

275
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:07,740
I submitted it before and didn't make it.

276
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:11,040
I made it to the final round, but

277
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:14,170
I keep getting rejected at the end.

278
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:16,410
Going all the way to the final means

279
00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:19,420
your work is ready.

280
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:22,490
Why not think this way?

281
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:23,780
First of all,

282
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:29,060
I think it would be good if you can find some kind of weapon to win over the judges.

283
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:32,200
- To win them over?
 - Yes.

284
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:35,810
I have participated in the recent Webtoon Camp.

285
00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:39,430
What I realized is that in a competition,

286
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:43,910
rather than work that all the judges agreed is good,

287
00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:46,800
something that people either like or dislike

288
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:49,450
and one or two judges would be like...

289
00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:51,580
They often say they're "stuck" on it.

290
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:55,200
It seems like the work that they really love like that is advantageous.

291
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,720
Like Sin Dae Ryuk?

292
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:03,320
That's right.

293
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:08,860
First of all, I really like cartoons with a strong theme.

294
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:12,600
This is about a love story between a human and AI.

295
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,060
That's what you're portraying, right?

296
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:16,970
Well... rather than that,

297
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:20,430
the main theme is the AI's search for his identity.

298
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:22,220
Gosh, I'm sorry. I keep putting my foot in my mouth.

299
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:25,520
It's okay. It's not your fault.

300
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:31,110
No one has been able to figure out the theme at first glance yet.

301
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:34,620
Artist Baek even said it's a tough one.

302
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:36,170
It's all my fault.

303
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:38,500
No, no, no...

304
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:02,180
 I really wanted to hear her say it was fun. 

305
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:06,030
 She never ended up saying that. 

306
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:10,060
What a relief!

307
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:12,940
You didn't leave yet. Here you go!

308
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:15,200
It started raining all of a sudden.

309
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,640
Thank you.

310
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,780
I'll return it to you next time.

311
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:21,370
No, it's okay. We have so many giveaway gift umbrellas in our office.

312
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:24,280
And this.

313
00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:27,560
What is it?

314
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:30,380
I used to carry it like an amulet when I did Judo.

315
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:33,940
I don't think I'll need it any longer.

316
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:35,690
It's bamboo.

317
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:36,790
It's mojuk.*
 (The highest-quality bamboo) 

318
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:39,600
I was in a terrible slump while doing judo at one point.

319
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,230
My dad must've heard something from somewhere.

320
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:44,900
He gave me this.

321
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:47,700
 - What's this? 
 - It's mojuk. 

322
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:52,330
 Mojuk doesn't sprout for five years after you plant the seed 

323
00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:54,630
 to be well rooted underground. 

324
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:56,710
 And after five years, 

325
00:20:56,710 --> 00:21:00,400
 it grows very fast, as much as tens of centimeters per day. 

326
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:05,350
 You feel like you're not improving right now, huh?  It's not so. 

327
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:09,980
 Now, you're just putting roots deep inside your body. 

328
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:11,920
 It's just taking some time. 

329
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,950
 And when your roots are fully mature, 

330
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:19,010
 your skills will sprout like crazy, like this mojuk. 

331
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:27,450
It's not much, but it was very encouraging for me.

332
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:31,400
I hope it becomes a good friend to you as well.

333
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:36,180
Thank you.

334
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,790
- Be careful going home in the rain. 
- Thank you.

335
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:01,090
Don't use artists as your excuse.

336
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:03,060
PDs aren't doing a good job.

337
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:05,800
Especially you!

338
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:08,620
Where did you rush off to in the rain?

339
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:10,830
I went to see Artist Im Dong Hui for a minute.

340
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:11,940
What's going on with Artist Dong Hui?

341
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:15,030
He's preparing for a competition. He asked me to review his manuscript.

342
00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:17,200
He's not working with a PD from another company?

343
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,980
That got cancelled.

344
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:21,450
He must be preparing for another competition.

345
00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:23,610
Artist Im has a solid foundation, but

346
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:25,300
luck doesn't seem to be on his side.

347
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:27,380
What luck?

348
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:30,210
That's the limit of his talent.

349
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:33,270
A minute difference is what determines one's talent.

350
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,490
What now?

351
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:36,830
Do you think I'm wrong?

352
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:42,610
Couldn't we help him make up for that minute difference?

353
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:49,030
Don't give that impression to Artist Dong Hui.

354
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:53,290
Sometimes irresponsible kindness is more harmful than malice.

355
00:22:53,290 --> 00:22:55,020
Got that?

356
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:57,560
Back to work.

357
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:07,590
 Answer right away 

358
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:11,880
PD Gu.

359
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:14,230
Let's meet with Artist Lee Wu Jin.

360
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:16,610
- Right now?
 - Yeah.

361
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:27,520
 Renewing Presence on Neon Homepage, By Gu Jun Yeong, Neon Webtoon Service Team 

362
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:30,020
This is PD Gu Jun Yeong. You know him, right?

363
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:32,210
Yes. I met him at the camp.

364
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:38,180
Once you start your series, he'll be the PD in charge.

365
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:39,940
Excuse me?

366
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:41,740
Why?

367
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:43,450
You don't want to?

368
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:46,010
No.

369
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:47,470
I look forward to working with you!

370
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:50,630
Although my series hasn't been confirmed yet.

371
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:53,800
Well, you've been well on your way.

372
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:56,600
You reviewed the manuscript for "Full Count," right?

373
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:57,640
Yes.

374
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,340
What did you think?

375
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:00,780
It was fun.

376
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:04,530
The story moved quickly and the baseball theme felt quite refreshing.

377
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:06,020
Thank you!

378
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:08,720
But shall I say it was heavy in explanation?

379
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:13,190
I thought the text explaining the rules and the game was way too heavy.

380
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:14,680
Before you could get interested in the story,

381
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:17,130
I thought you could get tired of it with too much information.

382
00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:18,130
Right.

383
00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:22,060
We had pointed that out during the camp as well.

384
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:25,040
And for readers like me who aren't into baseball,

385
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:28,460
I think it needs something to hook me in.

386
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:30,480
What kind of...

387
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,640
 Romance  
 Well, romance or—

388
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:35,980
I ruled out romance from the get-go for this webtoon.

389
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:37,310
Why is that?

390
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:39,490
Even though it's a baseball comic, it takes place on campus.

391
00:24:39,490 --> 00:24:41,310
Just because a high school girl is the main character 
  High School Girl 

392
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:44,000
doesn't mean you must have romance. 
  High school girl ≠ Romance  

393
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,800
The episodes are about the many experiences a high school girl has while playing baseball among boys.

394
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:52,760
I started this story to show character development.

395
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:56,730
If romance is thrown into that, the story might be altered.

396
00:24:56,730 --> 00:24:58,120
Isn't that your bias?

397
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,890
A romantic storyline is not a bad thing.

398
00:24:59,890 --> 00:25:03,590
In reality, there's always a romantic aspect. 
  It's about romance anyway. 

399
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:06,640
As long as the focus isn't shifted, I think it'll be good.

400
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:11,230
Or aren't you confident about having to draw romantic cartoons?

401
00:25:11,230 --> 00:25:12,930
I can draw romantic cartoon very well!

402
00:25:12,930 --> 00:25:14,730
If you want, I can mix in BL  (Boy Love)   theme

403
00:25:14,730 --> 00:25:18,430
and I can possibly do an entire love line involving the whole baseball team.

404
00:25:18,430 --> 00:25:21,080
Oh, that sounds like fun!

405
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,320
Pardon?

406
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,580
Excuse me?

407
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:27,910
I mean, I think you two are both right.

408
00:25:27,910 --> 00:25:32,640
Please think this through, Artist Lee Wu Jin.

409
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:36,580
Okay.

410
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:38,610
Please look at this favorably.

411
00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:42,060
When it becomes an official series, I want your work to be very popular.

412
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:44,790
That's why I'm saying this.

413
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,460
Good work.

414
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:56,990
I'll get going then.

415
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:06,400
What happened? I guess everyone left for lunch?

416
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,340
Should I order sandwiches then?

417
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:09,900
Sure.

418
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:20,810
- This one for me.
- Me, too.

419
00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:22,530
Okay.

420
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:31,450
It's good!

421
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:34,110
But

422
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:37,160
you're coming on too strong for your first meeting.

423
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:40,360
I thought my honest feedback would be helpful to her.

424
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:44,020
I'm sure you feel the same way.

425
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:46,390
Why didn't you tell Artist Lee Wu Jin about it already?

426
00:26:46,390 --> 00:26:49,280
You were considering it as a series already.

427
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:51,910
Well, the first reason is

428
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:56,200
I wanted Artist Lee Wu Jin to tell her story as much as she can in the beginning.

429
00:26:56,200 --> 00:27:01,150
The second reason is that I was going to put you in charge of her anyway.

430
00:27:01,150 --> 00:27:04,890
The proposal necessary for the series approval meeting. You work that, too, okay?

431
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:06,140
What?

432
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:09,140
Include the love line within the entire baseball team, too.

433
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:10,000
What?

434
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,610
Y-You're kidding, right?

435
00:27:13,610 --> 00:27:16,350
I'm here for you.

436
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:18,040
Good luck!

437
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,870
 Answer right away 

438
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:31,830
You must be busier than me, Gu Jun Yeong.

439
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:34,100
It's hard to reach you.

440
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:35,890
- My apologies.
  - Oh, no! 

441
00:27:35,890 --> 00:27:38,330
 I like that you're working hard. 

442
00:27:38,330 --> 00:27:44,700
But you'll have to speed things up on the data I requested.

443
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:46,130
Oh, yes.

444
00:27:46,130 --> 00:27:48,000
I got it.

445
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:55,540
 Messages 

446
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:58,320
 Are you free this Friday and Saturday? 

447
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,270
Yes, CEO.

448
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:04,880
Yes.

449
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,900
Really?

450
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:09,740
Yes, thank you, CEO!

451
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:10,720
Of course.

452
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:15,120
So that you won't regret this, our Webtoon team will work hard!

453
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,510
Thank you!

454
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:18,450
Yes, bye now!

455
00:28:20,730 --> 00:28:24,020
- We're staying on the homepage?
 - Yeah!

456
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:28,230
Wow! We defended our spot on the homepage!

457
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:30,910
Let's work hard going forward!

458
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:37,450
- Let's go eat meat!
 - Sure! It's on me!

459
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:43,710
In the end, you'll put Webtoon on the homepage?

460
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:47,860
There are plenty of other services. Of all others, why Webtoon?

461
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:50,810
What Team Leader Jang Man Cheol said made sense.

462
00:28:50,810 --> 00:28:54,360
If we launched Webtoon for the influx of customers in their teens

463
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:56,420
looking at it longterm,

464
00:28:56,420 --> 00:29:00,300
I think we should give him full support for at least three years.

465
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:06,870
So when the results are out, he'll understand and accept it.

466
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:10,020
We should let him play the game on a level playing field

467
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:11,600
so that he won't complain later on.

468
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:15,200
A level playing field?

469
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:18,570
It seems like you're already leaning toward him quite a bit.

470
00:29:18,570 --> 00:29:20,350
Me?

471
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:24,360
Not at all.

472
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:27,090
Why would you think that?

473
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:36,670
Is everything going well with the preparations for the new series approval meeting?

474
00:29:36,670 --> 00:29:38,590
Yes, the new artist incubating team

475
00:29:38,590 --> 00:29:40,500
is working on Artists Lee Wu Jin and Sin Dae Ryuk's work.

476
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:42,290
They'll present work by both of them in the meeting.

477
00:29:42,290 --> 00:29:44,220
Sin Dae Ryuk?

478
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:47,370
Oh, PD On Ma Eum, are you confident?

479
00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:48,980
Yes.

480
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:51,070
His drawings improved a lot, and we have lots of manuscript content.

481
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:54,760
I'm sure you'll be dying to find out what's coming up next in the story.

482
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:55,890
Really?

483
00:29:55,890 --> 00:29:57,980
Even if Artist Sin Dae Ryuk is ready to go,

484
00:29:57,980 --> 00:30:00,870
you realize that it's all pointless if the PD isn't ready, right?

485
00:30:00,870 --> 00:30:01,990
Pardon?

486
00:30:01,990 --> 00:30:05,100
- Me?
 - Yeah, you.

487
00:30:08,770 --> 00:30:11,580
He's just telling you to do a good job on your proposal.

488
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:13,760
Be sure to attach the story and character summaries.

489
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,780
Oh, okay, okay.

490
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:18,010
Since PD Seok Ji Hyeong is in charge of Artist Lee Wu Jin's work,

491
00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:19,490
there shouldn't be any problems.

492
00:30:19,490 --> 00:30:22,390
Oh, PD Gu has been working on that one.

493
00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:24,220
Oh, really?

494
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:28,390
PD Gu Jun Yeong, you think you can do it?

495
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:31,240
He'll do just fine.

496
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,500
Okay, sure, sure.

497
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:35,240
I look forward to it. Really.

498
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:38,080
Especially Artist Sin Dae Ryuk's work.

499
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,040
Okay, that's it. Get back to work.

500
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:41,780
Good job!

501
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:44,450
Thank you!

502
00:30:50,610 --> 00:30:54,160
Gu Jun Yeong, wait. See me for a minute.

503
00:30:57,890 --> 00:31:02,860
Thanks to you, our Webtoon Team got to stay on the homepage.

504
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:06,530
You're a crucial part of our team.

505
00:31:06,530 --> 00:31:08,320
Thanks.

506
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:12,040
Don't mention it.

507
00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:15,910
 PD On Ma Eum 

508
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:23,310
- Yes?
 - Artist Sin!

509
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:28,820
For the next new series approval meeting, your "Peeve Weapon" will be presented.

510
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:30,400
What?

511
00:31:34,330 --> 00:31:37,740
I'll work hard, so we end up with great results.

512
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:39,900
Okay, I'll call you again.

513
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:42,080
All right.

514
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,120
Hey.

515
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,400
Wait, Deputy Editor.

516
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:56,690
Do you have a moment?

517
00:31:56,690 --> 00:31:58,070
PD On Ma Eum?

518
00:31:58,070 --> 00:31:59,790
Yes.

519
00:31:59,790 --> 00:32:04,100
During the new series approval meeting next week,

520
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:07,000
she says my work will be presented.

521
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,850
That's good. Good for you.

522
00:32:11,850 --> 00:32:15,020
Wow, if you get selected then, Neon will publish it right away?

523
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:17,460
Wow... I'm so jealous...

524
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:18,840
When will I get to make my debut?

525
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:20,400
You're still young.

526
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:22,420
You'll have to work ten years like me.

527
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:25,140
Hyeong, why do you curse me like that...

528
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:28,340
Did you hear that?

529
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:31,450
Stop joking around like that anymore.

530
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:37,920
What others hear as a curse, you've been telling yourself that for ten years.

531
00:32:39,370 --> 00:32:41,520
Hey, hey, you shouldn't...

532
00:32:42,490 --> 00:32:45,260
Hyeong, you'll make it this time and debut!

533
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:47,840
I can really feel it!

534
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:54,440
- Artist Im Dong Hui? 
- Yes.

535
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:57,360
I heard he made it to the final in our competition.

536
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,950
Do you possibly remember his manuscript?

537
00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:02,400
Oh! Yes!

538
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:06,650
He was rejected last time. I felt bad, so I bought him a drink.

539
00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:09,500
I gave him feedback on his manuscript recently.

540
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:12,180
I wonder if he got confused because of what I said.

541
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:15,000
Aren't you overestimating?

542
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:19,820
I believe Artist Im Dong Hui is extremely talented.

543
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:20,980
No, no.

544
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:23,510
Overestimating yourself.

545
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:32,540
At the moment, you're watching the process of developing

546
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:37,080
- Artists Lee Wu Jin and Sin Dae Ryuk from scratch, right? 
- Yes.

547
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:40,970
That didn't happen because PDs carried them through 100%.

548
00:33:40,970 --> 00:33:43,290
I remember Artist Dong Hui's manuscript.

549
00:33:43,290 --> 00:33:46,590
Even the reason he couldn't be the winner.

550
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:50,580
Wouldn't it be helpful if we told him the reason?

551
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:53,280
I'm not sure.

552
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:59,500
He should be able to answer that himself so that he makes genuine growth.

553
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:03,050
Regardless of the outcome.

554
00:34:09,330 --> 00:34:11,610
Enjoy your meal.

555
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:16,320
 Wedding: Nam Jeong Wu &amp; Son Jeong Eun  
It's so cool.

556
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,930
It feels like I haven't changed since college.

557
00:34:18,930 --> 00:34:21,160
I feel like everyone became grownups except me.

558
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:22,810
You're a grownup, too.

559
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:25,080
What else would you be then?

560
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:27,200
I don't know.

561
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:31,000
I feel like I just got older.

562
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,960
I didn't grow up inside at all, but

563
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:35,120
only my outside appearance got older. That kind of feeling.

564
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:37,260
Things will work out for you, too.

565
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:39,900
You've worked under Artist Baek Eo Jin for ten years.

566
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:42,220
Not just anyone could do that.

567
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:45,210
Among us we all think that you're amazing.

568
00:34:45,210 --> 00:34:47,970
Everyone has let go of their dreams a long time ago,

569
00:34:47,970 --> 00:34:52,080
but you've given up your youth to achieve that dream.

570
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:54,030
It's amazing, of course.

571
00:34:54,970 --> 00:34:56,880
I know.

572
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:00,440
I guess I gave up my youth.

573
00:35:02,030 --> 00:35:07,010
My dream is more expensive than I thought.

574
00:35:07,010 --> 00:35:10,620
What if I can't buy it in this life?

575
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,940
 Papaya Webtoon Competition 

576
00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:43,970
 2022 Papaya Webtoon Competition Winners 

577
00:35:43,970 --> 00:35:47,150
 Kim Hyeon Ji, Min Gyeong, JK, Seung Hyeon... 

578
00:36:56,650 --> 00:37:00,330
 Are you afraid of me? 

579
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:06,660
 Are you afraid of me? 

580
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:56,910
Hey, you're here.

581
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:02,080
Isn't Hyeong Dong Hui in today?

582
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:04,900
No. He hasn't called in, either.

583
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:07,580
The competition result was posted yesterday.

584
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:09,750
I wonder if it's because of that.

585
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:12,960
Did he make it?

586
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,750
He didn't make it again.

587
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:16,280
I wonder if he's traumatized.

588
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:21,090
He always laughed and kept coming to the studio, even though he didn't make it.

589
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:22,700
I'm sure he's got a lot on his mind

590
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:24,870
since he's much older now.

591
00:38:24,870 --> 00:38:26,540
Lucky you!

592
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:29,530
You got lucky and will get to make your debut.

593
00:38:58,150 --> 00:39:01,560
By chance did you touch my laptop?

594
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:04,100
What do you mean? Why would anyone do that?

595
00:39:06,350 --> 00:39:09,450
I mean, this is broken...

596
00:39:09,450 --> 00:39:11,210
Try turning it back on.

597
00:39:11,210 --> 00:39:13,840
I can't turn it on!

598
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:18,360
All my manuscript files are on this thing.

599
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:20,640
Didn't you back them up?

600
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,260
No...

601
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:24,080
You should've had a backup.

602
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:26,610
What if you get errors on your files?

603
00:39:29,410 --> 00:39:31,500
You did this, didn't you?

604
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:35,210
- Hyung, wait...
- What the hell are you doing?

605
00:39:35,210 --> 00:39:36,870
Someone destroyed my laptop!

606
00:39:36,870 --> 00:39:39,470
So, what about it!

607
00:39:39,470 --> 00:39:41,280
Are you saying I did it?

608
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,900
You crazy nut!

609
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:51,120
What's going on?

610
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:53,290
Why are you guys fighting?

611
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:04,060
 Webtoon Focal Points 

612
00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:09,560
Are things going well?

613
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:11,370
I'm doing whatever I can, but

614
00:40:11,370 --> 00:40:14,660
when I think that the new artists' debuts are on the line,

615
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:16,940
it seems to lack something no matter how much I work on it.

616
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:18,570
 Artist Sin Dae Ryuk 

617
00:40:18,570 --> 00:40:21,030
What's going on with Artist Sin Dae Ryuk?

618
00:40:21,030 --> 00:40:23,780
He never calls me up first.

619
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:26,010
Hello, Artist Sin.

620
00:40:27,070 --> 00:40:29,920
 All my content vanished. 

621
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:33,250
What? What are you talking about?

622
00:40:33,250 --> 00:40:37,210
All the storyboards that were on my computer vanished.

623
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:41,180
 The manuscripts from beginning to end. All of it. 

624
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:43,930
Please calm down, Artist Sin.

625
00:40:43,930 --> 00:40:46,280
I'll be right over. You're in the studio, right?

626
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:48,420
Yes, I'll be right over.

627
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:51,270
Why? Is something wrong?

628
00:40:51,270 --> 00:40:53,710
Oh, yes. I've got to go.

629
00:40:53,710 --> 00:40:55,730
- Let's go together.
 - No, you're busy.

630
00:40:55,730 --> 00:40:57,770
I'm sure two will be more helpful.

631
00:40:57,770 --> 00:40:59,650
Don't you have to resolve it fast?

632
00:40:59,650 --> 00:41:02,530
- Then will you go with me?
 - Sure.

633
00:41:17,810 --> 00:41:21,590
Thankfully, I had backed up all the manuscripts you had emailed me.

634
00:41:21,590 --> 00:41:24,430
So, you don't have to worry too much.

635
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:29,980
You must've had files you haven't sent me.

636
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:31,560
Yes.

637
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:38,860
But still I can just redraw those.

638
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:44,270
Then is everything pretty much resolved?

639
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:49,110
Is Artist Im Dong Hui out today?

640
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:52,950
If someone intentionally broke Artist Sin Dae Ryuk's laptop,

641
00:41:52,950 --> 00:41:54,890
we should find out.

642
00:41:54,890 --> 00:41:56,700
Do you have CCTVs in your studio?

643
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:58,880
I never thought

644
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:01,810
I would need such a thing in the assistant artists' studio.

645
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:03,790
I'm sorry, Artist Baek. He didn't mean it that way—

646
00:42:03,790 --> 00:42:05,620
To be honest, I think he's paranoid.

647
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:09,480
Hyeong Dong Hui and I are both proud of our skills.

648
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:10,890
Who cares about Sin Dae Ryuk—

649
00:42:10,890 --> 00:42:12,610
Stop. Stop it.

650
00:42:12,610 --> 00:42:15,880
All right... with this,

651
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:18,250
it seems things are pretty much resolved.

652
00:42:18,250 --> 00:42:20,600
You can both leave now.

653
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:24,460
Sin Dae Ryuk, you, too.

654
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:26,890
You had your fault in this as well.

655
00:42:26,890 --> 00:42:31,060
I hope you don't make an issue out of this anymore.

656
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:33,440
Yes.

657
00:42:35,750 --> 00:42:37,780
All right then.

658
00:42:37,780 --> 00:42:39,740
I'm sorry, Artist Baek.

659
00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:41,730
I'm sorry, sir.

660
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:58,780
He had denied it, but

661
00:42:58,780 --> 00:43:02,100
do you think he's being bullied?

662
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:05,470
He doesn't seem like an easy victim.

663
00:43:06,190 --> 00:43:09,340
Unless he's the one shutting out the entire world.

664
00:43:10,870 --> 00:43:14,060
But I didn't see Artist Im Dong Hui there today.

665
00:43:14,060 --> 00:43:15,260
He couldn't have done that, could he?

666
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:17,340
Gosh, no way.

667
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:20,460
Artist Dong Hui is someone who is far from such actions.

668
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:22,940
He's usually very attentive toward Artist Sin Dae Ryuk, too.

669
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:24,790
By looking at one's outer appearance,

670
00:43:24,790 --> 00:43:27,520
you just never know about how one feels inside.

671
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:02,300
You didn't come in today.

672
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:06,020
I guess you didn't get a good result again?

673
00:44:10,090 --> 00:44:12,050
I'm sorry.

674
00:44:12,050 --> 00:44:14,260
I should've told you.

675
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:15,870
Really?

676
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:19,770
I'm sure you needed some time to gather your thoughts.

677
00:44:19,770 --> 00:44:23,670
But you shouldn't behave like a child.

678
00:44:23,670 --> 00:44:24,970
Excuse me?

679
00:44:24,970 --> 00:44:30,130
I calmed down Sin Dae Ryuk somewhat.

680
00:44:31,590 --> 00:44:35,040
This incident is not like you.

681
00:44:35,890 --> 00:44:38,410
I'm sorry.

682
00:44:38,410 --> 00:44:40,750
I couldn't help it.

683
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:43,770
Just know this.

684
00:44:43,770 --> 00:44:51,050
Working on your cartoons means continuously looking at your heart.

685
00:44:52,070 --> 00:44:55,020
No matter how ugly and pathetic you seem,

686
00:44:55,020 --> 00:44:58,310
you must face yourself.

687
00:45:03,770 --> 00:45:05,530
Sir,

688
00:45:06,750 --> 00:45:11,850
I really hate him to death.

689
00:45:12,510 --> 00:45:16,280
I'm so envious of his talent.

690
00:45:17,660 --> 00:45:21,880
I'm going crazy because I'm so jealous.

691
00:45:23,170 --> 00:45:28,870
I also want to be like that guy.

692
00:45:58,010 --> 00:46:00,580
Hey, Hyeong, you came.

693
00:46:00,580 --> 00:46:02,320
Hey.

694
00:46:18,550 --> 00:46:19,930
 2022 Papaya Webtoon Competition Winners 
 Hyeong,

695
00:46:19,930 --> 00:46:22,720
you know the grand prize winner in the Papaya Competition?

696
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:24,150
He's so young.

697
00:46:24,150 --> 00:46:26,040
He's a student at an elite university.

698
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:28,020
And he even draws good cartoons.

699
00:46:28,020 --> 00:46:31,170
So jealous. Why is the world so unfair?

700
00:46:31,170 --> 00:46:33,770
The story sucked.

701
00:46:33,770 --> 00:46:37,240
An ordinary setup and ordinary protagonist.

702
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:41,240
Hey, it's amazing that he made it that much more interesting with an ordinary setup.

703
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:44,550
I'm sure that person has never failed.

704
00:46:45,170 --> 00:46:50,290
Neither has he been hated on or been treated like an eyesore.

705
00:46:51,210 --> 00:46:53,340
Are you that dissatisfied with that?

706
00:46:53,340 --> 00:46:54,690
It's not that I'm dissatisfied with it.

707
00:46:54,690 --> 00:46:58,480
He's got a place to go back to even if he doesn't get to draw cartoons.

708
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:01,200
So you don't have a place to go back to?

709
00:47:07,830 --> 00:47:09,720
I don't.

710
00:47:10,830 --> 00:47:12,980
A clean slate.

711
00:47:15,740 --> 00:47:18,430
You had a job.

712
00:47:18,430 --> 00:47:22,510
It was just a means to live.

713
00:47:22,510 --> 00:47:24,900
Unless I draw cartoons,

714
00:47:26,590 --> 00:47:29,450
my life is meaningless.

715
00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:47,540
 Artist Dong Hui, can I meet you in private? 

716
00:47:51,060 --> 00:47:53,690
Thankfully, I had the backup files.

717
00:47:53,690 --> 00:47:55,250
We were able to save the manuscripts.

718
00:47:55,250 --> 00:47:58,350
But also considering what happened at lunch last time,

719
00:47:58,350 --> 00:48:04,600
I wondered if Artist Sin Dae Ryuk is having a hard time adjusting.

720
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:08,990
I understand what your concerns are.

721
00:48:08,990 --> 00:48:13,280
No one bothers Artist Sin Dae Ryuk at the studio.

722
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:15,490
Gosh, of course! I know.

723
00:48:15,490 --> 00:48:20,730
I just got worried that I got too ambitious by

724
00:48:20,730 --> 00:48:25,410
placing Artist Sin in an uncomfortable setting.

725
00:48:25,410 --> 00:48:29,110
Now that you say that, I feel much better.

726
00:48:29,110 --> 00:48:31,380
I'm envious of Artist Sin Dae Ryuk.

727
00:48:31,380 --> 00:48:32,640
What? How come?

728
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:38,820
Like you, PD On Ma Eum, he has a PD who kindly looks after him.

729
00:48:38,820 --> 00:48:45,330
Now, I see why Artist Sin said you're like a god to him.

730
00:48:45,330 --> 00:48:47,780
He said that? Gosh, no.

731
00:48:47,780 --> 00:48:50,500
I didn't do anything for him.

732
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:53,230
The fact that I didn't get to meet

733
00:48:53,230 --> 00:48:59,090
a PD like you while I was younger was my misfortune.

734
00:48:59,090 --> 00:49:01,110
Don't say such a thing.

735
00:49:01,110 --> 00:49:04,230
I think you've met many PDs who were better than me.

736
00:49:04,230 --> 00:49:06,950
If so, it means I was just bad.

737
00:49:06,950 --> 00:49:09,070
No. That's not what I meant.

738
00:49:09,070 --> 00:49:11,050
I know.

739
00:49:11,050 --> 00:49:12,140
I'm sorry.

740
00:49:12,140 --> 00:49:17,930
I can't seem to change this habit of constant self-deprecation.

741
00:49:19,170 --> 00:49:21,870
How about the competition?

742
00:49:22,580 --> 00:49:25,000
I didn't make it this time, either.

743
00:49:27,590 --> 00:49:31,400
Then could you send me the manuscript you sent into the competition?

744
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:33,860
I'll show it to Deputy Editor.

745
00:49:33,860 --> 00:49:35,700
No.

746
00:49:36,350 --> 00:49:38,090
It's okay.

747
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:41,930
Why?

748
00:49:41,930 --> 00:49:43,960
Thank you for everything, PD On.

749
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:46,840
- Bye now.
 - Be careful going home.

750
00:50:12,310 --> 00:50:15,300
 Even though everyone else made their debut and I stayed back, 

751
00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:18,180
 I endured making silly jokes. 

752
00:50:18,180 --> 00:50:21,080
 Before others could mock me, I mocked myself first. 

753
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:23,380
 Saying that in front of an aspiring cartoonist who spent the last ten years trying to debut. 

754
00:50:23,380 --> 00:50:25,330
 Isn't that too mean, PD? 

755
00:50:25,330 --> 00:50:29,050
 Then, I must be "anyone" since I've been here for ten years. 

756
00:50:29,050 --> 00:50:33,060
 If you debut first later on, hire me as your assistant, okay? 

757
00:50:33,060 --> 00:50:36,110
 Telling myself I needed more time. 

758
00:50:36,110 --> 00:50:38,380
 That I just need to try harder. 

759
00:50:38,380 --> 00:50:39,830
 A little more. 

760
00:50:39,830 --> 00:50:41,360
 A little more. 

761
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:43,430
 A little more. 

762
00:50:43,430 --> 00:50:49,590
 That someday, I can be like Artist Baek Eo Jin hypnotizing myself with that thought. 

763
00:50:51,820 --> 00:50:56,590
 The moment I saw Sin Dae Ryuk's cartoon, I woke up from the hypnosis. 

764
00:50:57,620 --> 00:51:02,430
 The emotion that I had never felt reading my cartoons. 

765
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:30,420
Are you okay?

766
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:49,310
 Unless I draw cartoons, 

767
00:51:51,180 --> 00:51:53,730
 my life is meaningless. 

768
00:51:53,730 --> 00:51:57,530
 He doesn't care about what others say and he only speaks about what's real to him.  

769
00:51:57,530 --> 00:51:59,880
 A truly free genius. 

770
00:52:01,060 --> 00:52:06,860
 He's the type of person the world of comics love, right? 

771
00:52:08,210 --> 00:52:10,070
 Not me. 

772
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,960
 Manuscript review and revision direction recommendation 

773
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:48,780
What are you doing?

774
00:52:48,780 --> 00:52:52,650
Weren't you writing a proposal for Artist Sin Dae Ryuk?

775
00:52:52,650 --> 00:52:53,810
I finished that already.

776
00:52:53,810 --> 00:52:56,910
This is Artist Im Dong Hui's manuscript.

777
00:52:56,910 --> 00:53:00,370
I think my feedback to him last time was too casual.

778
00:53:00,370 --> 00:53:03,490
So I thought it'd be more helpful if I gave more detailed feedback.

779
00:53:03,490 --> 00:53:05,710
Your effort is impressive.

780
00:53:05,710 --> 00:53:08,010
You're not even his PD.

781
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:13,010
I can't give him all the answers,

782
00:53:13,010 --> 00:53:16,230
but we can work out the issues together.

783
00:53:16,230 --> 00:53:18,570
He's so hardworking and talented.

784
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:21,750
It seems like he's short on luck every time.

785
00:53:21,750 --> 00:53:27,240
You can say that he's quite lucky considering how much attention you give him.

786
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:29,130
What in the world...

787
00:53:29,130 --> 00:53:32,320
Gosh, I feel like I should work harder now that you say that.

788
00:54:04,550 --> 00:54:08,030
Are you also leaving without a word to me?

789
00:54:09,770 --> 00:54:11,990
No, sir.

790
00:54:11,990 --> 00:54:15,110
I was going to speak to you in the morning.

791
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:26,000
Has it already been ten years that you've worked for me?

792
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,430
Yes.

793
00:54:28,580 --> 00:54:33,700
Thank you for everything, sir.

794
00:54:38,490 --> 00:54:43,010
Did you finally face yourself?

795
00:54:43,990 --> 00:54:47,640
It took so long.

796
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:54,020
I finally realized that you've been waiting for me all along.

797
00:54:56,280 --> 00:55:00,720
I waited for you to break through that

798
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:04,240
and put up a good fight.

799
00:55:12,650 --> 00:55:14,510
I'm sorry.

800
00:55:17,410 --> 00:55:20,020
I think this is it for me.

801
00:55:23,060 --> 00:55:24,990
And...

802
00:55:26,500 --> 00:55:29,250
I was truly happy.

803
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:36,570
Thanks to you, I was able to dream.

804
00:56:14,500 --> 00:56:15,990
Artist Dong Hui!

805
00:56:15,990 --> 00:56:17,920
Aigoo, PD Ma Eum.

806
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:20,660
I wanted to stop by and see you for a second. Are you going somewhere?

807
00:56:20,660 --> 00:56:22,740
Oh, yes.

808
00:56:22,740 --> 00:56:24,930
It won't take long.

809
00:56:24,930 --> 00:56:27,580
- Thank you!
 - Sure.

810
00:56:27,580 --> 00:56:29,460
Thank you!

811
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:35,530
It looked like a bike you rode all the time.

812
00:56:35,530 --> 00:56:37,380
Yes.

813
00:56:37,380 --> 00:56:40,080
I bought it when I started working as an assistant artist.

814
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:43,030
I rode it for about ten years.

815
00:56:43,850 --> 00:56:46,380
Anyway, why did you want to see me?

816
00:56:50,730 --> 00:56:54,140
Did you need to say something more regarding Sin Dae Ryuk?

817
00:56:54,140 --> 00:56:57,040
Nope. I'm here to see you today, Artist Dong Hui.

818
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:58,820
Me?

819
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:06,900
I should've given it to you sooner.

820
00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:09,720
What's this?

821
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:13,290
 Manuscript review and revision direction recommendation 

822
00:57:13,970 --> 00:57:18,700
I don't think the feedback I gave you last time was that helpful.

823
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:26,740
 Manuscript review and revision direction recommendation 

824
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:30,810
 Method 2: Strengthen the mystery 

825
00:57:30,810 --> 00:57:33,240
 Regarding characters 

826
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:39,920
Thank you so much, PD On.

827
00:57:40,690 --> 00:57:43,620
But I'll quit working as a cartoonist.

828
00:57:43,620 --> 00:57:45,090
What?

829
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:47,860
Wait, why?

830
00:57:47,860 --> 00:57:49,620
I think this is all I'm capable of.

831
00:57:49,620 --> 00:57:51,430
No. Why?

832
00:57:51,430 --> 00:57:53,210
You can try a little bit longer.

833
00:57:53,210 --> 00:57:56,470
- The debut is right in front of you.
 - No.

834
00:57:56,470 --> 00:57:59,780
Already ten years have passed thinking like that.

835
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:07,300
I'm the one who destroyed Sin Dae Ryuk's laptop.

836
00:58:07,300 --> 00:58:10,570
I'm sorry I didn't tell you last time.

837
00:58:12,380 --> 00:58:17,190
Whenever I saw Sin Dae Ryuk, I kept getting angry.

838
00:58:17,190 --> 00:58:19,030
When I looked at him,

839
00:58:19,030 --> 00:58:25,230
I'd catch myself running away using my dream as an excuse.

840
00:58:25,230 --> 00:58:32,240
He's creating works that I had dreamed of in the very beginning.

841
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,580
I realized it while looking Sin Dae Ryuk.

842
00:58:35,580 --> 00:58:41,550
In actuality, I was afraid of becoming a professional.

843
00:58:41,550 --> 00:58:45,890
I was afraid of being seriously critiqued and facing it head-on,

844
00:58:45,890 --> 00:58:49,080
yet I'd say, "Why wouldn't people recognize my talent?"

845
00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:52,700
"I'm sure someone will recognize me someday."

846
00:58:52,700 --> 00:58:55,900
All I did was resent them and wait.

847
00:58:55,900 --> 00:58:57,420
So pathetic, right?

848
00:58:57,420 --> 00:59:02,250
I can't believe the first courage I've mustered up in ten years is the courage to quit.

849
00:59:05,340 --> 00:59:08,020
But I still don't regret it.

850
00:59:08,750 --> 00:59:13,700
Up until now, I've given my best in my own way,

851
00:59:13,700 --> 00:59:17,390
and I was truly happy.

852
00:59:17,390 --> 00:59:18,650
Well,

853
00:59:19,700 --> 00:59:22,210
although that sounds like an excuse.

854
00:59:24,350 --> 00:59:26,480
No, not at all.

855
00:59:30,670 --> 00:59:35,130
I'll return this to you.

856
00:59:36,950 --> 00:59:39,480
I wasn't a mojuk.

857
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:42,080
I'm not qualified to accept this.

858
00:59:43,530 --> 00:59:45,770
No, Artist Dong Hui.

859
00:59:45,770 --> 00:59:49,060
The ten years that you've withstood.

860
00:59:49,060 --> 00:59:52,050
I'm sure it will be reflected somewhere down the road.

861
00:59:52,050 --> 00:59:56,550
Wherever you may be doing whatever you do.

862
01:00:00,910 --> 01:00:04,870
It's my gift to you. Please keep it.

863
01:00:07,060 --> 01:00:09,120
I will then.

864
01:00:10,670 --> 01:00:12,860
Please stay at the company for a long time,

865
01:00:12,860 --> 01:00:16,480
and create lots of great webtoons,

866
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:18,720
and fun webtoons.

867
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:23,920
PD On Ma Eum, you're more than capable of doing a great job.

868
01:01:09,640 --> 01:01:12,670
When did you get home? I didn't even hear you come in.

869
01:01:21,340 --> 01:01:23,260
Mom...

870
01:01:24,750 --> 01:01:26,490
Why?

871
01:01:27,090 --> 01:01:29,100
Did something happen?

872
01:01:30,050 --> 01:01:31,920
Today...

873
01:01:32,990 --> 01:01:39,280
I saw someone give up the dream for his last ten years of becoming a webtoon artist.

874
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:41,680
I wanted to stop him, too.

875
01:01:43,130 --> 01:01:44,770
Thinking, "He shouldn't give up."

876
01:01:44,770 --> 01:01:47,010
"What a waste."

877
01:01:47,010 --> 01:01:49,590
"He should try one more time."

878
01:01:55,660 --> 01:01:57,940
I thought of Dad.

879
01:01:58,700 --> 01:02:01,860
How precious I must be to Dad.

880
01:02:06,890 --> 01:02:09,500
Do you know how Dad feels now?

881
01:02:13,740 --> 01:02:17,220
But I couldn't stop that person.

882
01:02:17,990 --> 01:02:22,820
Because he had put everything into his work for the last ten years.

883
01:02:25,310 --> 01:02:27,550
Just like my Ma Eum?

884
01:02:30,180 --> 01:02:32,010
Like me.

885
01:02:38,170 --> 01:02:40,870
Dad will figure it out soon.

886
01:02:40,870 --> 01:02:43,870
He just needs time to accept it.

887
01:03:10,790 --> 01:03:14,390
Everyone, give me a moment.

888
01:03:15,140 --> 01:03:19,650
Im Dong Hui decided to leave as of today.

889
01:03:19,650 --> 01:03:21,370
What?

890
01:03:25,530 --> 01:03:28,180
Thanks for everything, guys.

891
01:03:28,180 --> 01:03:30,300
Thank you for everything, sir.

892
01:03:30,300 --> 01:03:32,880
Thank you for all your work.

893
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:35,380
Help Dong Hui move his things.

894
01:03:35,380 --> 01:03:36,900
N-No.

895
01:03:36,900 --> 01:03:38,480
I already packed everything, and

896
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:41,890
my uncle said he'd picked me up when I mentioned I'm going back home.

897
01:03:41,890 --> 01:03:43,560
Don't walk me out. You're all busy.

898
01:03:43,560 --> 01:03:47,080
- No, but still—
 - I'm really fine.

899
01:03:49,380 --> 01:03:51,750
He's here.

900
01:03:51,750 --> 01:03:53,780
Bye, guys.

901
01:03:53,780 --> 01:03:56,430
Call me when you come down to Busan.

902
01:03:57,190 --> 01:03:59,990
Sir, I'll go now.

903
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:12,840
I think Dong Hui forgot to take this.

904
01:04:12,840 --> 01:04:15,140
I'll take it to him.

905
01:04:23,820 --> 01:04:26,460
♫  How is your day?  ♫

906
01:04:26,460 --> 01:04:29,300
♫  How is your heart?  ♫

907
01:04:30,070 --> 01:04:32,640
You left this.

908
01:04:32,640 --> 01:04:35,870
I left it on purpose.

909
01:04:35,870 --> 01:04:38,040
For you to use it.

910
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:44,440
I won't need it anymore. Put it to good use.

911
01:04:44,440 --> 01:04:47,290
Why are you leaving?

912
01:04:47,290 --> 01:04:50,340
Is it because of me?

913
01:04:50,340 --> 01:04:54,790
Because I hassled you too much, Hyeong?

914
01:04:54,790 --> 01:04:56,180
Yeah.

915
01:04:56,180 --> 01:04:58,030
That's right.

916
01:04:58,030 --> 01:05:01,140
That's why I'm going to quit.

917
01:05:01,140 --> 01:05:03,360
♫  My heart which shines like that far away starlight  ♫

918
01:05:03,360 --> 01:05:07,230
Actually, I didn't get to tell you this then.

919
01:05:07,230 --> 01:05:09,790
Your cartoon moved me.

920
01:05:09,790 --> 01:05:12,130
It almost made me want to cry while reading it.

921
01:05:12,130 --> 01:05:15,790
About the AI's search for his identity.

922
01:05:15,790 --> 01:05:19,410
I empathized with it a lot.

923
01:05:20,640 --> 01:05:23,380
You're the first!

924
01:05:26,730 --> 01:05:33,070
You're the first person to recognize that my cartoon was about his search for his identity!

925
01:05:34,770 --> 01:05:37,750
Gosh, thank you.

926
01:05:37,750 --> 01:05:40,730
I'm good that you've recognized my story.

927
01:05:44,010 --> 01:05:46,870
Well...

928
01:05:46,870 --> 01:05:53,100
The person who destroyed your notebook is me.

929
01:05:53,100 --> 01:05:54,940
Do you know why I did that?

932
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:05,000
my drawings were so terrible.

933

Hey! You're really something!

936
01:06:15,310 --> 01:06:17,250
Work hard.

937
01:06:17,250 --> 01:06:19,390
Including my share.

938
01:06:19,390 --> 01:06:21,630
I'm me.

939
01:06:21,630 --> 01:06:24,570
I can't be you, Hyeong.

940
01:06:24,570 --> 01:06:26,040
Right.

941
01:06:26,040 --> 01:06:28,380
You're right.

942
01:06:38,200 --> 01:06:40,050

954
01:07:34,680 --> 01:07:37,890
Artist Dong Hui arrived at his own answer,

955
01:07:37,890 --> 01:07:41,200
so I'll respect it.

956
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:42,940
I see.

957
01:07:42,940 --> 01:07:44,910
Yeah.

958
01:07:44,910 --> 01:07:50,740
Since he fiercely ran after his dream,

959
01:07:50,740 --> 01:07:53,580
he could come to that conclusion.

960
01:07:54,840 --> 01:07:57,070
I've said this the other day, but

961
01:07:57,070 --> 01:08:00,280
just because you take care of everything for them

962
01:08:00,280 --> 01:08:03,320
doesn't mean you can make an artist.

963
01:08:03,320 --> 01:08:09,100
But rather, being overprotective could be detrimental.

964
01:08:14,920 --> 01:08:17,390
Then Deputy Editor,

965
01:08:17,390 --> 01:08:21,590
what kind of newbie artist do you wish to raise under your care?

966
01:08:21,590 --> 01:08:23,160
Me?

967
01:08:28,210 --> 01:08:31,650
Even if the PD in charge or the platform changes,

968
01:08:31,650 --> 01:08:37,950
an artist who could stand on his own and work it through.

969
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:48,100
Well, you know, a cartoon is born at the tip of an artist's hand anyway.

970
01:09:09,210 --> 01:09:11,800
 Artist Pomme 

971
01:09:11,800 --> 01:09:13,490
Yes, Artist Pomme.

972
01:09:13,490 --> 01:09:15,550
Could you come over right now?

973
01:09:15,550 --> 01:09:19,550
I think someone is watching me in my house.

974
01:09:19,550 --> 01:09:21,930
What are you talking about?

975
01:09:21,930 --> 01:09:25,090
I'll be right there.

976
01:09:31,980 --> 01:09:34,560
Hey, we came here last time.

977
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:35,690
That's right.

978
01:09:35,690 --> 01:09:37,440
What the heck? You said you found a new place.

979
01:09:37,440 --> 01:09:38,570
Let's go!

980
01:09:38,570 --> 01:09:40,350
Fine.

981
01:09:41,900 --> 01:09:44,900
- Welcome!
 - Hello.

982
01:09:46,580 --> 01:09:48,880
What's wrong, Deputy Editor?

983
01:09:53,990 --> 01:09:55,850
- YoungToon...
 - Sir?

984
01:09:55,850 --> 01:09:58,420
Please give us a bottle of beer.

985
01:09:58,420 --> 01:10:00,660
Thank you!

986
01:10:00,660 --> 01:10:02,210
My gosh! I'll pour it for you!

987
01:10:02,210 --> 01:10:04,580
What's Artist Na Gang Nam doing he—

988
01:10:04,580 --> 01:10:07,030
You drink well.

989
01:10:07,030 --> 01:10:11,520
Why is Artist Na Gang Nam meeting YoungToon's deputy editor?

990
01:10:12,510 --> 01:10:19,470


991
01:10:19,470 --> 01:10:21,860
♫  Just running breathlessly is too much  ♫

992
01:10:21,860 --> 01:10:25,550
♫  You are a friend who is a flag stuck on a lonely desert island. Don't go away  ♫

993
01:10:25,550 --> 01:10:28,690
♫  Don't think it. Even facing a crisis, you can break a stereotype.  ♫

994
01:10:28,690 --> 01:10:31,800
♫  Take the test. Even if can break like that wall, it is solid.  ♫

995
01:10:31,800 --> 01:10:34,740
♫  If it goes the way you want, think of the eye of a hurricaine  ♫

996
01:10:34,740 --> 01:10:37,960
♫  When night casts away fear again with light like a diamond  ♫

997
01:10:37,960 --> 01:10:42,630
♫  Absolute emergencies and most departures are decisions of anxiety.  ♫

998
01:10:42,630 --> 01:10:44,640
♫  Just scream it like this song  ♫

999
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:47,940
♫  Can't you predict everything? Pain also is like waves.  ♫

1000
01:10:47,940 --> 01:10:50,270
♫  Can't I be your strength? Even if I am bearing it now I'm scared  ♫

1001
01:10:50,270 --> 01:10:53,190
 Today's Webtoon 

1002
01:10:53,190 --> 01:10:57,880
 I wish you'd create cartoons you've always wanted to create. 

1003
01:10:57,880 --> 01:10:59,130
 Are you nervous? 

1004
01:10:59,130 --> 01:11:00,690
 I should finish it up soon. 

1005
01:11:00,690 --> 01:11:03,100
 I think there could be some main artists who might leave. 

1006
01:11:03,100 --> 01:11:05,780
 There's not much to see in Neon Webtoon if Na Gang Nam leaves. 

1007
01:11:05,780 --> 01:11:09,800
 Gumiho Princess was my role model and friend. 

1008
01:11:09,800 --> 01:11:12,790
 Please make it a masterpiece with the best ending. 

1009
01:11:12,790 --> 01:11:17,550
 I think it's rare for geniuses to last a long time. 

1010
01:11:17,550 --> 01:11:19,110
 Really? 

1011
01:11:19,110 --> 01:11:21,710
 Why did you do that exactly? 

1012
01:11:21,710 --> 01:11:24,460
♫  I think you will smile brightly.  ♫
