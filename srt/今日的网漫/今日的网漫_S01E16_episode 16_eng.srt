00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:08,010


2
00:00:31,006 --> 00:00:34,014
 Today's Webtoon 

3
00:00:38,769 --> 00:00:39,981
Hey, come and eat.

4
00:00:39,981 --> 00:00:41,904
Nope, I'm on a diet.

5
00:00:41,904 --> 00:00:45,284
You're so skinny. Why a diet?

6
00:01:06,481 --> 00:01:09,941
The leading candidate for the next chairman of the

7
00:01:09,941 --> 00:01:15,801
US Federal Reserve System, Kate Brown, the former Secretary of the Treasury...

8
00:01:18,271 --> 00:01:21,351
The leading candidate for the next chairman of the US Federal Reserve System,

9
00:01:21,351 --> 00:01:25,071
Kate Brown, the former Secretary of the Treasury, has expressed an intention to resign

10
00:01:25,071 --> 00:01:28,811
according to a report by the foreign press on the 15th, local time.

11
00:01:29,511 --> 00:01:31,651
Reporter On Ma Eum at the scene?

12
00:01:33,442 --> 00:01:35,140
Reporter On Ma Eum?

13
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:37,280
 Seongjin General Hospital 

14
00:01:43,378 --> 00:01:45,511
- All right, then.
- I'll...

15
00:01:45,511 --> 00:01:48,361
go after having a word with Artist Sin.

16
00:01:50,041 --> 00:01:51,451
Okay.

17
00:02:05,651 --> 00:02:09,221
Mr. Baek Eo Jin will wake up, right?

18
00:02:09,221 --> 00:02:11,091
Of course.

19
00:02:11,091 --> 00:02:13,191
He'll wake up for sure.

20
00:02:13,191 --> 00:02:16,541
I didn't even get to thank him properly.

21
00:02:18,701 --> 00:02:23,131
He took me in as an assistant when I couldn't even draw.

22
00:02:23,131 --> 00:02:24,701
That's why...

23
00:02:25,431 --> 00:02:28,341
I'm here today, thanks to him.

24
00:02:30,371 --> 00:02:33,571
Should we have stopped Mr. Baek's surgery?

25
00:02:33,571 --> 00:02:36,801
This surgery is Artist Baek's courage toward his

26
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:41,550
own dream to complete the dragon series and a decision that only he could make.

27
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:43,881
I'm sure no one would've been able to stop him.

28
00:02:43,881 --> 00:02:46,551
Artist Dae Ryuk and Ma Eum seemed to be quite upset.

29
00:02:46,551 --> 00:02:49,751
They act like they're okay, but it doesn't seem that way at all.

30
00:02:51,201 --> 00:02:55,081
You need to stop acting like you're okay when you're not too.

31
00:02:55,781 --> 00:03:00,121
When it's hard for you, you can let us know.

32
00:03:02,681 --> 00:03:05,841
He'll get well since he's a strong person.

33
00:03:11,711 --> 00:03:16,891
 Jun Yeong. For you to muster the courage to fight 

34
00:03:16,891 --> 00:03:20,581
 is to protect the people you love, right? 

35
00:03:20,581 --> 00:03:24,961
 But what if these people you love can't work with you? 

36
00:03:24,961 --> 00:03:26,891
 Are you okay with that? 

37
00:03:28,211 --> 00:03:30,621
 We chose to fight to the end. 

38
00:03:34,391 --> 00:03:37,361
- It's all over now, right?
 - Yes.

39
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:51,950
- Did you declare your love, PD Jun Yeong? 
 - Excuse me?

40
00:03:52,001 --> 00:03:55,021
I thought you were going to before.

41
00:03:55,021 --> 00:03:57,671
I guess you didn't yet?

42
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:05,431
If you're going to waver like that I just might confess first.

43
00:04:06,951 --> 00:04:09,671
Artist... are you...

44
00:04:12,141 --> 00:04:15,031
in love with PD Ma Eum?

45
00:04:15,031 --> 00:04:16,961
Seriously...

46
00:04:18,311 --> 00:04:20,571
You're unbelievable.

47
00:04:23,431 --> 00:04:25,961
Since you need some help,

48
00:04:25,961 --> 00:04:31,721
I'll recommend to you a few videos that will help you with confessing.

49
00:04:59,251 --> 00:05:03,121
Mom, I think it's about time we order the food.

50
00:05:03,121 --> 00:05:06,161
- Write it down.
 - Okay.

51
00:05:07,551 --> 00:05:10,271
My goodness, welcome!

52
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:12,171
Oh, cool Oppa!

53
00:05:12,171 --> 00:05:14,161
Hey, Jun Yeong, what brings you here?

54
00:05:14,161 --> 00:05:16,141
Did you come to read comics?

55
00:05:16,141 --> 00:05:20,991
Hey! Think about it. You think he came to read comics?

56
00:05:20,991 --> 00:05:23,951
We were about to take a break because it's a bit slow right now.

57
00:05:23,951 --> 00:05:25,381
Please make yourself at home.

58
00:05:25,381 --> 00:05:26,851
Ma Eum, please take good care of the cafe.

59
00:05:26,851 --> 00:05:28,481
- Wait, Mom...
 - What's the issue?

60
00:05:28,481 --> 00:05:31,731
Your temper... Try being coy, for goodness sake!

61
00:05:31,731 --> 00:05:33,761
What's the matter with her?

62
00:05:33,761 --> 00:05:37,321
I'm sorry. I need to finish cleaning, so take a seat.

63
00:05:45,381 --> 00:05:47,311
I'm going to move.

64
00:05:47,311 --> 00:05:48,731
Really?

65
00:05:48,731 --> 00:05:50,121
Yeah.

66
00:05:50,121 --> 00:05:52,591
Since I'm done paying off the student loan,

67
00:05:52,591 --> 00:05:54,841
I don't think I'll need a second job now.

68
00:05:54,841 --> 00:05:56,614
This calls for congratulations.

69
00:05:56,614 --> 00:05:59,694
Do you need anything for the move? I'll buy it all for you.

70
00:06:00,461 --> 00:06:02,381
Love your coworker and love your country?

71
00:06:02,381 --> 00:06:05,941
Yes, that's correct. "Love your coworker and love your country!"

72
00:06:09,481 --> 00:06:12,921
Just... recommend a comic to me today.

73
00:06:12,921 --> 00:06:15,741
Something good to read when you're finishing a chapter of your life.

74
00:06:15,741 --> 00:06:18,661
Something to read when you're finishing a chapter of your life?

75
00:06:18,661 --> 00:06:20,551
Well...

76
00:06:21,551 --> 00:06:23,581
that's right here.

77
00:06:23,581 --> 00:06:26,731
Don't you just need someone to talk to?

78
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:31,650
- That's true. Then keep. 
 - Keep?

79
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:35,811
I'll ask you again when I'm done moving.

80
00:06:35,811 --> 00:06:38,581
Please talk with me then.

81
00:06:38,581 --> 00:06:40,991
Okay, keep.

82
00:07:00,261 --> 00:07:04,301
 We should be different today than yesterday because we took that one step. 

83
00:07:11,761 --> 00:07:19,431
 Dragon's Dream, Written and Drawn by Baek Eo Jin 

84
00:07:25,151 --> 00:07:29,970
 Comic Book Cafe On 

85
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:32,871
Director Heo Kwan Yeong will be going on an extended vacation. 
   Neon 

86
00:07:32,871 --> 00:07:36,191
After that, he'll resign from the company.

87
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:39,411
Also... regarding the report...

88
00:07:39,411 --> 00:07:41,981
Well, CEO, Mr. Gu Jun Yeong is—

89
00:07:41,981 --> 00:07:44,541
It was made anonymously.

90
00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:47,571
An anonymous informant will remain anonymous

91
00:07:47,571 --> 00:07:50,361
and continue to work hard for us.

92
00:07:53,541 --> 00:07:55,341
I see.

93
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:04,051
Chief Jang Man Cheol. No, Hyeong.

94
00:08:04,051 --> 00:08:08,311
You heard about it too, right?  About me going on a vacation.

95
00:08:08,311 --> 00:08:14,011
Well, we don't know if this is the end or just another beginning.

96
00:08:14,711 --> 00:08:17,001
Please help me out.

97
00:08:18,441 --> 00:08:20,681
Whenever or wherever we meet again,

98
00:08:20,681 --> 00:08:25,191
my team and I will be a lot stronger than you think, Director.

99
00:08:25,191 --> 00:08:27,901
- Hey, Jang Man Cheol will still be Jang Man Cheol—

100
00:08:27,901 --> 00:08:31,371
Kwan Yeong setting up traps, stabbing in the back,

101
00:08:31,371 --> 00:08:34,091
and falling into your own traps.

102
00:08:34,091 --> 00:08:38,941
Don't live too hard like that and try treating the people...

103
00:08:43,221 --> 00:08:45,441
around you with your heart.

104
00:08:46,531 --> 00:08:48,831
Have a good vacation.

105
00:09:03,731 --> 00:09:08,151
There were some talks about the webtoon team collaborating with the game team.

106
00:09:08,151 --> 00:09:12,451
It would be nice if you could take the lead with this.

107
00:09:13,161 --> 00:09:15,651
- Me?
 - It's a long-term project.

108
00:09:15,651 --> 00:09:17,861
You need to prepare thoroughly.

109
00:09:19,031 --> 00:09:24,151
Oh, and the crucial informant who finished off Director Heo

110
00:09:24,151 --> 00:09:25,941
stayed anonymous to the end.

111
00:09:25,941 --> 00:09:28,561
No one has met the guy, apparently.

112
00:09:29,291 --> 00:09:31,301
Is he Hong Gil Dong (Korean version of Robin Hood)?

113
00:09:35,521 --> 00:09:38,091
You had a lot to struggle with all this time, huh?

114
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:40,841
No, sir.

115
00:09:41,864 --> 00:09:45,031
The war is not over. It just got started.

116
00:09:45,031 --> 00:09:47,254
In the position where you are, Mr. Gu Jun Yeong,

117
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:50,884
please keep fighting with us as you've done so far.

118
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:55,450
Yes.  I'll do my best.

119
00:09:58,191 --> 00:10:01,071
I think I'm gifted with good people.

120
00:10:01,071 --> 00:10:02,901
Seriously...

121
00:10:07,431 --> 00:10:11,141
This is the list of artists to contact first.

122
00:10:13,871 --> 00:10:15,361
 "Bong Bong Chocolate" Son Jeong Woo 

123
00:10:15,361 --> 00:10:16,971
This is the information regarding investment. 
  "Black Lion" Nam Jeong Yul 

124
00:10:16,971 --> 00:10:19,161
Please take a look later as well.

125
00:10:20,391 --> 00:10:22,961
Have you thought about the company name?

126
00:10:22,961 --> 00:10:24,831
I do have a name in mind.

127
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:28,350
- What is it? 
 - It's Ginger.

128
00:10:30,141 --> 00:10:32,271
- Ginger?
 - Yes.

129
00:10:32,271 --> 00:10:35,061
Studio Ginger.

130
00:10:38,601 --> 00:10:43,361
Rather than a painful ending, it would be better to think of it as a new beginning.

131
00:10:43,361 --> 00:10:46,891
It's a hard suggestion to decline

132
00:10:46,891 --> 00:10:50,081
since my beginning was also with Ginger.

133
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:57,950
- Artist Baek is still unconscious? 
 - Yes.

134
00:10:58,041 --> 00:11:01,771
I'm an artist, too, but I'd never be able to make the same choice.

135
00:11:01,771 --> 00:11:05,771
His resolve for comics is incredible.

136
00:11:07,331 --> 00:11:12,711
He worked up the courage, so I hope he achieves his dream.

137
00:11:16,681 --> 00:11:19,091
He needs to wake up soon.

138
00:11:19,091 --> 00:11:21,411
He will wake up.

139
00:11:23,451 --> 00:11:25,631
 Dragon's Dream 

140
00:11:31,641 --> 00:11:35,891
 Dragon's Dream 

141
00:11:59,701 --> 00:12:02,561
Are you awake, sir?

142
00:12:10,621 --> 00:12:12,901
The results of the contest have been announced.

143
00:12:12,901 --> 00:12:16,141
Yes, we just need to contact the winners.

144
00:12:16,751 --> 00:12:18,031
- But...
 - Huh?

145
00:12:18,031 --> 00:12:22,791
This work was selected by PD Yeong Bae and Ma Eum.  
 List of Winners 

146
00:12:24,221 --> 00:12:25,941
The grand prize.

147
00:12:27,191 --> 00:12:30,191
H-Hold on.

148
00:12:30,191 --> 00:12:32,091
Yes, ma'am?

149
00:12:33,161 --> 00:12:34,861
Yes.

150
00:12:36,711 --> 00:12:38,641
Yes.

151
00:12:39,391 --> 00:12:41,591
Yes, I understand.

152
00:12:43,481 --> 00:12:46,081
  PD On Ma Eum 
 Dragon's Dream 

153
00:12:54,641 --> 00:12:55,941
Yes, PD On.

154
00:12:55,941 --> 00:13:01,391
Yes, Artist Sin. Artist Baek Eo Jin has regained consciousness.

155
00:13:06,971 --> 00:13:08,891
Artist Sin?

156
00:13:10,761 --> 00:13:12,891
Thank God.

157
00:13:14,731 --> 00:13:16,711
What a great relief.

158
00:13:16,711 --> 00:13:20,871
 Dragon's Dream 

159
00:13:20,871 --> 00:13:22,071
Okay.

 Intensive Care Unit 

161
00:13:24,491 --> 00:13:26,421
Honey.

162
00:13:26,421 --> 00:13:29,431
Honey, are you all right?

00:13:42,031 --> 00:13:44,691
Oh, my, ma'am. Are you working?

165
00:13:44,691 --> 00:13:46,121
Why yes, I am.

166
00:13:46,121 --> 00:13:48,291
Goodness, gracious.

167
00:13:48,291 --> 00:13:50,651
These works were chosen as winners of the contest,

168
00:13:50,651 --> 00:13:52,951
I want to study up before the meeting with the artists tomorrow.

169
00:13:52,951 --> 00:13:54,791
I see.

170
00:13:54,791 --> 00:13:57,111
- It's a daily comic? 
- Yeah.

171
00:13:57,111 --> 00:13:58,751
A story about traveling?

172
00:13:58,751 --> 00:14:03,741
The story takes place at a travel agency, but it's very realistic and lively.

173
00:14:03,741 --> 00:14:05,921
It's really fun.

174
00:14:07,011 --> 00:14:14,571
I guess... these days, stories that can be read comfortably are in demand.

175
00:14:14,571 --> 00:14:17,721
Something that's minor and relatable.

176
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:21,441
Pretty good there.

177
00:14:21,441 --> 00:14:22,851
Yes, I got quite a lot to say.

178
00:14:22,851 --> 00:14:24,821
What did you just say, Webtoon Witch?

179
00:14:24,821 --> 00:14:26,981
Ordinary, but not ordinary.

180
00:14:26,981 --> 00:14:28,581
"Ordinary, but not ordinary..."

181
00:14:28,581 --> 00:14:30,391
In other words, being ordinary is what makes it special?

182
00:14:30,391 --> 00:14:31,551
Oh, yes! That's it!

183
00:14:31,551 --> 00:14:34,361
- Great point there.
 - Yes, yes.

184
00:14:34,361 --> 00:14:36,481
And minor what?

185
00:14:36,481 --> 00:14:39,291
- My story? 
 - My own minor story.

186
00:14:39,291 --> 00:14:40,901
My own minor...

187
00:14:40,901 --> 00:14:43,871
- Right, right.
 - That was a very important point!

188
00:14:43,871 --> 00:14:45,821
I'm pretty good...

189
00:14:45,821 --> 00:14:48,561
- As expected, you indeed are Webtoon Witch. 
 - Yes, that's me all right.

190
00:14:48,561 --> 00:14:51,481
Please leave me alone so I can focus.

191
00:14:51,481 --> 00:14:54,221
You sucked the sweetness out of me (used me and abused me).

192
00:14:54,221 --> 00:14:57,811
- Thank you!
 - Bye now! What to do now...

193
00:14:57,811 --> 00:14:59,751
Thanks for your help!

194
00:14:59,751 --> 00:15:02,031
Sure thing!

195
00:15:02,031 --> 00:15:04,251
Ordinary... nice...

196
00:15:04,251 --> 00:15:07,131
Gosh, that's pretty good...

197
00:15:08,701 --> 00:15:16,521
 Webtoon, thank you 

198
00:15:16,521 --> 00:15:18,811
- Hi.
 - Hello.

199
00:15:18,811 --> 00:15:20,711
Hello!

200
00:15:21,391 --> 00:15:25,611
- I'll take over Artist Ruby. 
 - Excuse me?

201
00:15:25,611 --> 00:15:29,781
I always took charge of the top three contest winners' work.

202
00:15:29,781 --> 00:15:32,201
You can let it go, PD On.

203
00:15:32,201 --> 00:15:35,391
But I don't think that's fair.

204
00:15:36,031 --> 00:15:37,981
Fair?

205
00:15:39,541 --> 00:15:42,541
Does it look like I'm doing this for my benefit?

206
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:47,101
Do you think Artist Ruby's work will hit it big if you release it just as is?

207
00:15:47,101 --> 00:15:50,101
It would be loved by a few maniacs and end there.

208
00:15:50,101 --> 00:15:53,771
If you switch the gender of the lead character and add some romance,

209
00:15:53,771 --> 00:15:56,531
don't you think it would be a mega-hit?

210
00:15:56,531 --> 00:15:57,751
Right?

211
00:15:57,751 --> 00:16:00,261
This hasn't crossed your mind, has it?

212
00:16:00,261 --> 00:16:05,741
Because you couldn't come up with ideas like this is the reason Artist Gu Seul Ah chose me last time.

213
00:16:09,911 --> 00:16:12,081
You know that "Travel Trouble" artist?

214
00:16:12,081 --> 00:16:17,281
PD Kwon said he's taking over and declared it to PD On.

215
00:16:17,281 --> 00:16:19,771
It will be different this time around.

216
00:16:20,631 --> 00:16:22,381
Oh, yeah?

217
00:16:23,401 --> 00:16:25,451
On what basis?

218
00:16:25,451 --> 00:16:27,961
Well... um...

219
00:16:27,961 --> 00:16:31,941
This time, why don't you both present your own proposals and pick whoever comes up with a better one?

220
00:16:31,971 --> 00:16:33,791
Of course, as long as PD Kwon agrees to it.

221
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:36,961
Gosh, that'd hurt PD Kwon's ego—

222
00:16:38,721 --> 00:16:40,311
No.

223
00:16:41,521 --> 00:16:43,361
Sounds good.

224
00:16:46,321 --> 00:16:49,281
Let's do that. We'll compete with our proposals.

225
00:16:49,281 --> 00:16:54,071
Instead, you can't go back on your word saying you can't accept the result.

226
00:16:54,071 --> 00:16:58,011
Okay. In return, you make a promise, too, PD Kwon.

227
00:16:58,011 --> 00:17:01,721
That you'll accept the result.

228
00:17:04,651 --> 00:17:06,511
All right.

229
00:17:06,511 --> 00:17:08,471
Looking good, guys.

230
00:17:22,211 --> 00:17:24,041
Editor,

231
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:27,091
 Proposal for Best Webtoon Contest Sponsored by Neon 

232
00:17:27,091 --> 00:17:29,351
 Ruby 
 Artist Gu Seul Ah 

233
00:17:35,481 --> 00:17:38,791
You have to keep your promise this time, PD Kwon.

234
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:40,511
I said I got it.

235
00:17:40,511 --> 00:17:42,831
Did you ever see me speak from both ends of my mouth?

236
00:17:42,831 --> 00:17:44,471
I'm not sure.

237
00:17:44,471 --> 00:17:46,621
"Not sure"?

238
00:17:48,421 --> 00:17:50,891
Artist Gu Seul Ah...

239
00:17:54,811 --> 00:17:56,304
Artist Gu Seul Ah!

240
00:17:56,304 --> 00:17:58,984
Long time, no see, PD On.

241
00:18:03,181 --> 00:18:07,101
So "Travel Trouble" is... your work?

242
00:18:07,101 --> 00:18:08,371
Yes.

243
00:18:08,371 --> 00:18:11,111
I drew the webtoon while working at a travel agency.

244
00:18:11,111 --> 00:18:12,941
My goodness.

245
00:18:12,941 --> 00:18:15,171
Your pen name and the drawing style were both so different.

246
00:18:15,171 --> 00:18:17,041
I had no idea!

247
00:18:17,041 --> 00:18:19,131
Why didn't you tell us in advance?

248
00:18:19,131 --> 00:18:23,331
Because I didn't want to rely on someone else and achieve it on my own.

249
00:18:24,111 --> 00:18:27,591
More than anything, I enjoyed drawing the webtoon while working so much.

250
00:18:27,591 --> 00:18:29,701
 Starsand Tours 

251
00:18:29,701 --> 00:18:31,031
 Seul Ah, aren't you going to eat? 

252
00:18:31,031 --> 00:18:33,411
 Oh, I'm fine. Go ahead and eat. 

253
00:18:33,411 --> 00:18:34,561
 We'll be back. 

254
00:18:34,561 --> 00:18:36,731
 Enjoy your lunch. 

255
00:18:43,941 --> 00:18:50,061
 During the time I didn't draw webtoons, I felt bad for the dream that I had suppressed. 

256
00:18:50,061 --> 00:18:52,821
 Whether it was late at night or on weekends, 

257
00:18:52,821 --> 00:18:58,191
 rather than wanting to rest, I drew webtoons with the desire to draw and I had fun. 

258
00:18:58,191 --> 00:19:00,851
And that was the outcome of the process.

259
00:19:00,851 --> 00:19:04,041
So I just submitted it the way it was.

260
00:19:04,041 --> 00:19:06,071
Amazing, Artist Gu.

261
00:19:06,071 --> 00:19:08,741
Mustering up the courage to dream again

262
00:19:08,741 --> 00:19:11,551
and also coming back here.

263
00:19:11,551 --> 00:19:15,411
This time for real, you're now writing your own story, Artist Gu.

264
00:19:15,421 --> 00:19:19,721
I completed the story with the desire to work with you again.

265
00:19:21,081 --> 00:19:23,491
Well, well, well...

266
00:19:23,491 --> 00:19:26,271
This isn't an easy thing to do.

267
00:19:26,271 --> 00:19:30,941
Of course, you're... quite capable, you know.

268
00:19:30,991 --> 00:19:35,071
The difficulties you had last time were because we were running out of time.

269
00:19:35,071 --> 00:19:39,041
But this time, let us take our time as we develop it

270
00:19:39,041 --> 00:19:42,371
into well-made content.

271
00:19:42,371 --> 00:19:44,581
Once again, let's have you rank top daily webtoon—

272
00:19:44,581 --> 00:19:46,521
No.

273
00:19:46,521 --> 00:19:52,401
I guarantee that you'll rank in the top three out of all Neon Webtoons.

274
00:19:55,551 --> 00:19:59,321
May I choose the PD in charge?

275
00:19:59,321 --> 00:20:01,901
Of course, nothing has been decided internally.

276
00:20:01,901 --> 00:20:03,941
You could choose.

277
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:09,450
But which choice would be best for you,

278
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:11,031
we'd have to give it some thought, right?

279
00:20:11,031 --> 00:20:13,121
You went through a lot to create this story.

280
00:20:13,121 --> 00:20:15,891
We have to make it a success no matter what, don't you think?

281
00:20:17,071 --> 00:20:20,901
- No. My choice is—
 - Well, you don't have to tell us right this minute.

282
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:25,061
Please give it some serious thought. It's your life we're talking about.

283
00:20:25,061 --> 00:20:29,141
What if you regret your choice later after being emotional about it?

284
00:20:29,141 --> 00:20:31,281
Isn't that right, PD On?

285
00:20:35,461 --> 00:20:39,171
Of course, I'd love to work with you, Artist Gu.

286
00:20:39,171 --> 00:20:41,621
But since it's such a precious story you created,

287
00:20:41,621 --> 00:20:47,101
the PD in charge must also be decided thoughtfully.

288
00:20:47,101 --> 00:20:51,611
Please give it some serious thought and you can decide after that.

289
00:20:56,831 --> 00:20:58,851
What an interesting turn of events.

290
00:20:58,851 --> 00:21:01,651
Artist Seul Ah must have a lot on her mind, too.

291
00:21:01,651 --> 00:21:06,071
Isn't it obvious who Artist Seul Ah would choose?

292
00:21:06,071 --> 00:21:10,831
 - If it were me, I think I'd work with PD Kwon. 
 - Excuse me? 

293
00:21:10,831 --> 00:21:13,511
 It's maddening to end it after being used like that. 

294
00:21:13,511 --> 00:21:17,271
 PD Kwon is famous for turning his projects into big hits. 

295
00:21:17,271 --> 00:21:21,631
 You should definitely use PD Kwon this time around. 

296
00:21:21,631 --> 00:21:25,711
 But still, I really want to work with PD On this time. 

297
00:21:25,711 --> 00:21:31,201
 You'll have another chance to work with PD On next time. 

298
00:21:31,201 --> 00:21:35,291
 To gain something big, shouldn't you be a little flexible at times? 

299
00:21:44,271 --> 00:21:47,011
Oh, the contest winners' work this time around is all so fun.

300
00:21:47,011 --> 00:21:48,631
Did you take a look?

301
00:21:48,631 --> 00:21:51,451
Yeah. Out of them, was it "Travel Trouble"?

302
00:21:51,451 --> 00:21:53,091
That was totally awesome.

303
00:21:53,091 --> 00:21:54,791
- Did you think that, too?
 - Yeah.

304
00:21:54,791 --> 00:21:57,781
If you cleaned it up a bit, it'd be a huge hit.

305
00:21:57,781 --> 00:21:59,201
So, how?

306
00:21:59,201 --> 00:22:02,081
If it were up to me, I'd change the lead into a man

307
00:22:02,081 --> 00:22:04,781
and change it into his stories from his own world travels.

308
00:22:04,781 --> 00:22:07,951
Not hearing about the traveling customers' stories.

309
00:22:07,951 --> 00:22:12,461
And also have some romantic stories at some traveling spots.

310
00:22:12,461 --> 00:22:16,421
You bring up some similar points to PD Kwon.

311
00:22:18,281 --> 00:22:22,661
Reading a webtoon is a recreational activity and it needs a point story that can satisfy its readers.

312
00:22:22,661 --> 00:22:26,471
I think most professionals would think this way.

313
00:22:35,551 --> 00:22:38,561
 Change the woman character to a man 

314
00:22:41,821 --> 00:22:45,761
 Melodrama for the lead character 

315
00:22:50,311 --> 00:22:52,121
But if we change the story like that,

316
00:22:52,121 --> 00:22:54,961
it's really not "Travel Trouble" after all.

317
00:22:54,961 --> 00:22:57,071
 Happy Travel 

318
00:22:57,071 --> 00:22:59,091
 1. Era of 'healing' webtoons 

319
00:22:59,091 --> 00:23:01,171
 2. Youth's thirst for 'healing' 

320
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:03,401
Healing...

321
00:23:03,401 --> 00:23:07,161
would be the guide... 
  3. How much 'healing' content is out there? 

322
00:23:12,071 --> 00:23:14,291
Do you have that much work to do?

323
00:23:14,291 --> 00:23:17,421
Yeah. There's a project I don't want to miss out on.

324
00:23:17,421 --> 00:23:20,401
But you might get sick. Don't go to bed too late.

325
00:23:20,401 --> 00:23:21,931
Okay.

326
00:23:24,251 --> 00:23:26,831
- Dad.
 - Huh?

327
00:23:30,371 --> 00:23:32,661
There's this one artist...

328
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:36,441
I want her to draw work that really reflects her

329
00:23:36,441 --> 00:23:43,301
but another PD says the artist needs to change up her flavors to be loved by more people.

330
00:23:43,301 --> 00:23:47,351
If you were me, what do you think would be the better way to go?

331
00:23:48,891 --> 00:23:50,911
Well?

332
00:23:50,911 --> 00:23:53,301
I don't know too much about it, but

333
00:23:53,991 --> 00:23:57,921
I think I would've said whatever sells better would be the answer.

334
00:23:58,621 --> 00:24:03,941
But now, happiness is about living the way you want to live.

335
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:08,131
My goodness.

336
00:24:08,131 --> 00:24:12,541
Your dad is even advising you on your work now.

337
00:24:12,541 --> 00:24:15,461
Mr. On, please go in.

338
00:24:15,461 --> 00:24:17,551
Yes, ma'am.

339
00:24:17,551 --> 00:24:20,081
- Goodnight! 
- Good luck.

340
00:24:21,451 --> 00:24:23,481
Thanks for the juice!

341
00:24:29,431 --> 00:24:32,491
All right. Let's believe in yourself.

342
00:24:33,121 --> 00:24:36,191
 Emotional points in "Travel Trouble" 

343
00:24:36,191 --> 00:24:38,451
 Travel Trouble 

344
00:24:39,441 --> 00:24:41,361
I reviewed your proposal.

345
00:24:41,361 --> 00:24:43,791
 About the work: 1. Era of 'healing' webtoons 

346
00:24:43,791 --> 00:24:47,601
To prove that you weren't just going by your gut feeling, you provided plenty of data.

347
00:24:47,601 --> 00:24:51,641
It seems you've also figured out what the readers' current needs are.

348
00:24:52,571 --> 00:24:54,731
 A compliment? 

349
00:24:56,351 --> 00:24:57,721
I'm so sorry!

350
00:24:57,721 --> 00:25:00,741
- I'm so late.
 - No worries.

351
00:25:03,561 --> 00:25:05,511
Did you review the proposals we sent you?

352
00:25:05,511 --> 00:25:09,381
Yes. You both worked so hard on preparing them.

353
00:25:09,381 --> 00:25:12,221
I'm sorry, Artist Gu. We weren't trying to give you a hard time

354
00:25:12,221 --> 00:25:14,021
but the situation turned out this way.

355
00:25:14,021 --> 00:25:15,671
I didn't have a hard time.

356
00:25:15,671 --> 00:25:17,571
Rather than depending on someone else,

357
00:25:17,571 --> 00:25:21,171
I know that it's crucial that I do a good job.

358
00:25:21,901 --> 00:25:23,821
You're right about that.

359
00:25:23,821 --> 00:25:27,461
All the travel creators that you had given as examples, PD On,

360
00:25:27,461 --> 00:25:29,601
I was so shocked because I subscribe to all of them.

361
00:25:29,601 --> 00:25:33,601
Really? I subscribe to everyone on that list.

362
00:25:33,601 --> 00:25:36,001
We must have the same taste!

363
00:25:36,001 --> 00:25:41,161
No wonder! The unique sentiment of, well... the trendy feel of "Travel Trouble."

364
00:25:41,161 --> 00:25:42,841
I totally loved that.

365
00:25:42,841 --> 00:25:45,051
It felt like a healing sentiment for the people these days.

366
00:25:45,051 --> 00:25:48,031
PD Ma Eum, you recognized it as I expected.

367
00:25:49,021 --> 00:25:51,741
All right then...

368
00:25:51,741 --> 00:25:56,471
Artist Gu, you've thought this through, right?

369
00:26:05,621 --> 00:26:11,341
Then may I tell you now?

370
00:26:13,781 --> 00:26:21,621
Would it be... all right if I worked with PD Ma Eum?

371
00:26:27,741 --> 00:26:29,211
Of course.

372
00:26:30,191 --> 00:26:32,661
I think it's only right that...

373
00:26:33,501 --> 00:26:35,981
PD On works on "Travel Trouble."

374
00:26:38,321 --> 00:26:40,801
Thank you.

375
00:26:40,801 --> 00:26:44,101
I had many experiences, thanks to you, PD Kwon,

376
00:26:44,101 --> 00:26:47,061
and learned how to center myself.

377
00:26:47,781 --> 00:26:53,291
The reason "The Girls' Rule" was a success was because of your abilities, PD Kwon.

378
00:26:54,211 --> 00:26:56,771
Well, of course, I won't be in charge, but

379
00:26:56,771 --> 00:27:00,121
please consider the proposals I have made.

380
00:27:00,121 --> 00:27:03,341
All right then, the two of you discuss it further.

381
00:27:13,711 --> 00:27:16,851
After I let go of your hand last time,

382
00:27:16,851 --> 00:27:18,961
I regretted it a lot.

383
00:27:21,041 --> 00:27:24,661
As for my hand that you let go, you can hold it again like this.

384
00:27:34,001 --> 00:27:35,770
What's wrong?

385
00:27:36,761 --> 00:27:42,691
PD Kwon. Why do you think he wanted to work with me again?

386
00:27:42,691 --> 00:27:46,481
I'm sure PD Kwon didn't have to work with me.

387
00:27:47,201 --> 00:27:49,881
It means he recognized you.

388
00:27:49,881 --> 00:27:53,321
That your work is worthy of receiving lots of love from so many.

389
00:27:53,321 --> 00:27:55,811
You become greedy when you see a great piece of work.

390
00:27:55,811 --> 00:27:59,671
I'm sure all the PDs could identify with that.

391
00:28:01,611 --> 00:28:05,321
By chance... Artist Gu...

392
00:28:05,321 --> 00:28:07,681
If it's okay with you,

393
00:28:07,681 --> 00:28:13,721
would it be okay if PD Kwon and I take care of your work together?

394
00:28:13,721 --> 00:28:17,741
- Pardon? 
 - I realized a lot of things while reviewing PD Kwon's proposal.

395
00:28:17,741 --> 00:28:21,691
Gosh, it sure reflected PD Kwon.

396
00:28:21,691 --> 00:28:25,531
As for me, "How could I make your story more fun?"

397
00:28:25,531 --> 00:28:28,891
was my focus, but PD Kwon came up

398
00:28:28,891 --> 00:28:33,791
with the answer for, "How could I make more people read this?"

399
00:28:33,791 --> 00:28:37,631
To be honest, I was surprised when I saw his proposal.

400
00:28:37,631 --> 00:28:40,861
I felt his affection for my work.

401
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:43,811
You have two hands, anyway.

402
00:28:43,811 --> 00:28:48,871
You don't have to hold just one person's hand, don't you think?

403
00:28:58,151 --> 00:29:00,031
How did it go?

404
00:29:01,341 --> 00:29:03,001
I lost.

405
00:29:03,001 --> 00:29:05,561
Well, did her youth defeat me?

406
00:29:05,561 --> 00:29:09,391
Her passion, sensibilities, her approach.

407
00:29:09,391 --> 00:29:11,301
They were perfect.

408
00:29:12,231 --> 00:29:15,731
Geez, should we go and grab a drink?

409
00:29:15,731 --> 00:29:18,241
- What in the world?
 - I know.

410
00:29:18,241 --> 00:29:19,981
I'm craving it.

411
00:29:20,901 --> 00:29:24,101
Well, I guess it'd be good if you got drunk today.

412
00:29:24,101 --> 00:29:27,561
- Why?
 - I'll ask you to take the deputy editor position.

413
00:29:27,561 --> 00:29:29,611
Gosh, look at this guy. What's wrong with you?

414
00:29:29,611 --> 00:29:31,241
I won't do it. Don't ask me.

415
00:29:31,241 --> 00:29:35,361
Yeong Bae, we've stabilized in Neon now.

416
00:29:35,361 --> 00:29:37,551
Don't worry about the sales figures now.

417
00:29:37,551 --> 00:29:41,131
Why don't you do everything you couldn't do because you were worried about sales?

418
00:29:43,011 --> 00:29:45,611
I'll let you go home on time.

419
00:29:45,611 --> 00:29:50,181
Now that Ji Hyeong is gone, who could I ask to be the deputy editor?

420
00:29:50,181 --> 00:29:52,631
Gosh, forget it. No, no. Ask Du Hui to do it.

421
00:29:52,631 --> 00:29:53,991
I won't do it.

422
00:29:53,991 --> 00:29:55,441
You do like it.

423
00:29:55,441 --> 00:29:57,251
What do you mean? What…

424
00:29:57,251 --> 00:29:59,251
- You do like it.
 - What do you mean?

425
00:29:59,251 --> 00:30:00,761
I'm happy about going drinking.

426
00:30:00,761 --> 00:30:02,451
- You do like it.
 - What...

427
00:30:02,451 --> 00:30:06,541
Excuse me, might I possibly speak with PD Kwon?

428
00:30:06,541 --> 00:30:09,094
- Should I give you some space?
 - No, no, no!

429
00:30:09,801 --> 00:30:12,931
PD Kwon, by chance, would you like to

430
00:30:12,931 --> 00:30:17,541
manage Artist Seul Ah's work with me?

431
00:30:17,541 --> 00:30:20,901
- What?
 - This time, don't do it like last time.

432
00:30:20,901 --> 00:30:23,981
I want to be happy with both the process and the results.

433
00:30:24,671 --> 00:30:29,501
If I could work with you, I believe I can do that.

434
00:30:33,841 --> 00:30:35,301
Do you mean it?

435
00:30:35,301 --> 00:30:36,821
Yes.

436
00:30:38,871 --> 00:30:41,281
This is why all the seonbaes fall for me.

437
00:30:50,731 --> 00:30:52,341
What is she saying?

438
00:30:52,341 --> 00:30:55,541
- What is she saying?
 - She says we fall for her!

439
00:31:02,461 --> 00:31:04,641
Artist Lee, you seem tired.

440
00:31:04,641 --> 00:31:06,591
Have some.

441
00:31:07,381 --> 00:31:10,019
You're so sensible, PD Gu.

442
00:31:10,019 --> 00:31:12,119
Thank you.

443
00:31:20,291 --> 00:31:22,771
Have one, too, PD Gu.

444
00:31:22,771 --> 00:31:24,451
Okay.

445
00:31:29,471 --> 00:31:31,721
I feel like I'm waking up now.

446
00:31:35,421 --> 00:31:36,951
In this part,

447
00:31:36,951 --> 00:31:39,981
when the male lead confesses his love for the female lead,

448
00:31:39,981 --> 00:31:42,361
- how about he gives her a gift?— 
- Come on now.

449
00:31:42,361 --> 00:31:44,881
A gift would be too burdensome.

450
00:31:45,531 --> 00:31:50,531
If you watch popular video clips of love confessions these days, they all give a gift.

451
00:31:50,531 --> 00:31:52,641
Ma Eum,

452
00:31:52,641 --> 00:31:56,851
 Ma Eum, do you want to call it our Day 1 together? 

453
00:31:56,851 --> 00:31:58,871
Ma Eum,

454
00:31:58,871 --> 00:32:01,181
 Ma Eum, do you want to call it our Day 1 together? 

455
00:32:01,181 --> 00:32:03,131
 Let's call it our Day 1 together. 

456
00:32:03,131 --> 00:32:04,321
 Our Day 1. 

457
00:32:04,321 --> 00:32:07,121
 Let's date. Is today Day 1? 

458
00:32:09,141 --> 00:32:14,021
Would just an honest and simple confession do it?

459
00:32:15,921 --> 00:32:19,891
An honest and simple love confession...

460
00:32:22,391 --> 00:32:25,421
I hope the love confession goes well.

461
00:32:25,421 --> 00:32:27,691
- What?
 - Our male lead.

462
00:32:27,691 --> 00:32:32,601
The rest of the world knows it, but only he is unaware that he has fallen in love.

463
00:32:33,331 --> 00:32:35,281
I think so.

464
00:32:41,571 --> 00:32:44,751
Do you know our baby's prenatal name?

465
00:32:44,751 --> 00:32:45,891
What is it?

466
00:32:45,891 --> 00:32:47,791
Mandu.

467
00:32:48,421 --> 00:32:50,521
Really?

468
00:32:50,521 --> 00:32:53,851
I just love you so much, our Mandu.

469
00:32:53,851 --> 00:32:56,191
Ms. Han Seul...

470
00:32:57,521 --> 00:33:01,461
But I won't be seeing you often like this going forward.

471
00:33:01,461 --> 00:33:02,481
How come?

472
00:33:02,481 --> 00:33:04,741
After Artist Na Gang Nam's company is set up,

473
00:33:04,741 --> 00:33:05,841
the PD in charge will prob—

474
00:33:05,841 --> 00:33:08,411
Where do you think you're running off to?

475
00:33:19,231 --> 00:33:21,621
You said you were happy to be the PD in charge of "Gumiho Princess."

476
00:33:21,621 --> 00:33:22,981
Did you change your mind already?

477
00:33:22,981 --> 00:33:25,301
No! That's not it—

478
00:33:25,981 --> 00:33:31,831
Artist Na, could I continue to be your PD?

479
00:33:31,831 --> 00:33:34,711
Yeah! I'll continue to draw "Gumiho Princess."

480
00:33:34,711 --> 00:33:37,191
Of course, I'll have to work with you.

481
00:33:37,191 --> 00:33:39,931
Artist Na...

482
00:33:39,931 --> 00:33:43,351
Gosh, I was so sad since I couldn't tell anyone.

483
00:33:43,351 --> 00:33:47,031
I'm already so sad about Deputy Editor leaving as it is.

484
00:33:47,031 --> 00:33:50,691
I thought you were surely switching your PD, so all alone, I was...

485
00:33:50,691 --> 00:33:53,261
- You have a weak ma eum (heart).
 - Right...

486
00:33:56,331 --> 00:33:58,321
Gosh, our Mandu is crying!

487
00:33:58,321 --> 00:34:01,551
- Why cry...
 - What to do about our Mandu. Don't cry...

488
00:34:01,551 --> 00:34:03,761
- It's okay.
 - Our Mandu.

489
00:34:03,761 --> 00:34:07,071
- Not this Mandu. This Mandu.
 - Did you get scared?

490
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:11,550
- Console this Mandu...
 - Why cry! Why are you crying?

491
00:34:20,171 --> 00:34:21,551
Are you done?

492
00:34:21,551 --> 00:34:23,311
Yes.

493
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:25,101
Shall we walk out together?

494
00:34:25,101 --> 00:34:27,091
Sure thing.

495
00:34:44,791 --> 00:34:51,470
♫  Walking down a road which has no end in sight  ♫

496
00:34:52,631 --> 00:34:54,491
To have you

497
00:34:54,491 --> 00:34:59,151
as my first supervisor was such good fortune for me.

498
00:34:59,151 --> 00:35:01,521
That sounds like a farewell party comment.

499
00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:06,250
♫  Don't cry. Don't cry. It's okay.  You'll be fine.  ♫

500
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:10,051
I'm not leaving just yet. I still have a few days left.

501
00:35:10,051 --> 00:35:15,170
I didn't think I'd have a chance to tell you that once we get going with our work.

502
00:35:16,551 --> 00:35:22,191
I'm so grateful for so many things.

503
00:35:22,191 --> 00:35:24,051
And among them,

504
00:35:24,051 --> 00:35:27,901
I experienced something to be most grateful for while working with our team.

505
00:35:27,901 --> 00:35:28,941
What is it?

506
00:35:28,941 --> 00:35:34,450
Actually, my injury wasn't the reason I quit judo.

507
00:35:35,251 --> 00:35:36,921
My body healed, but

508
00:35:36,921 --> 00:35:42,181
it felt like my heart hadn't healed.

509
00:35:42,181 --> 00:35:45,961
But after meeting and working with our team members,

510
00:35:45,961 --> 00:35:51,320
I felt like everything was all better.

511
00:35:53,221 --> 00:35:55,591
I feel the same way.

512
00:35:55,591 --> 00:35:59,461
After you and Jun Yeong joined our team,

513
00:35:59,461 --> 00:36:02,550
it felt as though the wound in my heart healed entirely.

514
00:36:07,991 --> 00:36:10,681
That is why

515
00:36:10,681 --> 00:36:13,890
you're able to leave us.

516
00:36:14,911 --> 00:36:22,751
♫  I would have liked that you would be like my mom  ♫

517
00:36:22,751 --> 00:36:28,061
♫  Be on my side no matter what   ♫

518
00:36:30,781 --> 00:36:32,251
Go on.

519
00:36:32,251 --> 00:36:33,851
No, you go ahead.

520
00:36:33,851 --> 00:36:36,461
I brought my car. You go on.

521
00:36:36,461 --> 00:36:40,831
Then did you come all the way here with me on purpose?

522
00:36:40,831 --> 00:36:44,871
Gosh, the driver is waiting for you.

523
00:36:44,871 --> 00:36:47,600
Then I'll get going first.

524
00:36:49,281 --> 00:36:54,831
Be careful going home, Deputy Editor.

525
00:36:54,831 --> 00:37:00,770
♫  I will be with you. You and I  ♫

526
00:37:03,050 --> 00:37:11,250
♫  It will be fine if we do that. You will become mine.   ♫

527
00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:15,700
♫  I will become yours  ♫

528
00:37:18,131 --> 00:37:20,851
♫  Let's lean on each other  ♫

529
00:37:20,851 --> 00:37:24,280
 I realized it at that moment. 

530
00:37:25,391 --> 00:37:29,980
 That I was ready to jump over the last hurdle. 

531
00:37:30,911 --> 00:37:37,961
♫  When it's hard lets say be strong.  ♫

532
00:37:58,138 --> 00:38:02,811
Excuse me, could you call Eun Ji for me if she's in there?

533
00:38:02,811 --> 00:38:04,281
Sure.

534
00:38:08,904 --> 00:38:10,267
Eun Ji.

535
00:38:10,267 --> 00:38:12,427
Someone is here for you.

536
00:38:59,141 --> 00:39:05,131
 Song Eun Ji 

537
00:39:13,391 --> 00:39:16,391
I'm so sorry. It took me too long, didn't it?

538
00:39:24,051 --> 00:39:26,331
Have you been well?

539
00:39:34,401 --> 00:39:37,341
You were still doing judo.

540
00:39:56,689 --> 00:39:59,189
 Love your coworker and love your country 

541
00:40:00,251 --> 00:40:02,721
Gosh, I can't do it.

542
00:40:11,721 --> 00:40:13,731
 Love your coworker and love your country 

543
00:40:17,691 --> 00:40:19,471
 Love your coworker and love your country 

544
00:40:19,471 --> 00:40:21,801
Oh, hey, Ma Eum.

545
00:40:21,801 --> 00:40:25,741
Can I ask a favor from my coworker today?

546
00:40:26,558 --> 00:40:29,391
Oh, great! Great!

547
00:40:29,391 --> 00:40:32,191
"Love your coworker and love your country"?

548
00:40:43,131 --> 00:40:45,071
What's up?

549
00:40:46,961 --> 00:40:50,901
I feel like I've wrapped up one chapter of my life.

550
00:40:50,901 --> 00:40:54,901
I needed coworker Gu here, so I called you out.

551
00:40:56,721 --> 00:40:59,351
What kind of wrap-up did you do?

552
00:41:06,551 --> 00:41:10,291
Actually the reason I quit judo

553
00:41:10,291 --> 00:41:13,261
wasn't only because of my injuries.

554
00:41:14,781 --> 00:41:16,341
Then?

555
00:41:17,471 --> 00:41:19,511
There was a match where I had to win by a whole point

556
00:41:19,511 --> 00:41:23,661
in order to avoid a biased referee's decision. 
  Head Referees 

557
00:41:23,661 --> 00:41:26,711
 I had to go up against 

558
00:41:26,711 --> 00:41:31,901
 my precious friend whom others called my rival. 

559
00:41:31,901 --> 00:41:35,241
 So that I could win with a whole point, 

560
00:41:35,241 --> 00:41:39,861
I focused and attacked my friend's weak, injured leg.

561
00:41:52,461 --> 00:41:54,341
 My friend was taken to the hospital, 

562
00:41:54,341 --> 00:41:56,251
and as for me...

563
00:41:58,191 --> 00:42:02,821
Gosh, everything turned pale. I can't really remember much about that time.

564
00:42:02,821 --> 00:42:06,261
And then I suddenly came to my senses.

565
00:42:06,971 --> 00:42:11,241
 Then I noticed a gold medal hanging around my neck. 

566
00:42:15,771 --> 00:42:18,731
It must've been so tough for you.

567
00:42:18,731 --> 00:42:20,511
Yeah.

568
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:26,911
I met that friend today.

569
00:42:26,911 --> 00:42:31,411
I saw her for the first time since that incident.

570
00:42:34,551 --> 00:42:37,711
She just hugged me.

571
00:42:37,711 --> 00:42:39,901
It took a lot of courage.

572
00:42:40,561 --> 00:42:44,881
If I hadn't met all our webtoon members and hadn't lived through times like this,

573
00:42:45,831 --> 00:42:47,701
I don't think I would've mustered up the courage for my whole life.

574
00:42:47,701 --> 00:42:49,601
I'm not sure about that.

575
00:42:49,601 --> 00:42:54,651
I think the On Ma Eum that I know would've ultimately overcome the obstacle

576
00:42:54,651 --> 00:42:57,861
in any way possible.

577
00:42:59,751 --> 00:43:01,851
Oh, really?

578
00:43:06,921 --> 00:43:11,520
What kind of person is On Ma Eum, according to Gu Jun Yeong?

579
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:14,940
 Now is the time... 

580
00:43:14,951 --> 00:43:17,591
All the people in the world!

581
00:43:17,591 --> 00:43:20,191
Please make sure there's no one out there who hasn't read "Animal Junction" (renamed from Animal Military Academy).

582
00:43:20,191 --> 00:43:23,831
Well, since it's a number one comic webtoon, I guess everyone has seen it.

583
00:43:23,831 --> 00:43:26,161
Of course, not only is he handsome,

584
00:43:26,161 --> 00:43:31,511
the fact that Artist Oh Yun is best at his day job sure is displayed once more.

585
00:43:31,511 --> 00:43:33,411
Cut! Cut…

586
00:43:33,411 --> 00:43:35,721
Gosh, it's been three seconds, right?

587
00:43:36,431 --> 00:43:38,780
We need time to make edits. Okay.

588
00:43:41,921 --> 00:43:43,051
Dad, light!

589
00:43:43,051 --> 00:43:44,261
What about the light?

590
00:43:44,261 --> 00:43:47,131
Can you raise the light just a little bit?

591
00:43:48,071 --> 00:43:49,121
- Like this?
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

592
00:43:49,121 --> 00:43:51,281
This will protect the throat of a YouTuber with 50K viewers.

593
00:43:51,281 --> 00:43:53,501
- Pear and bellflower tea.
 - Oh, my. How sensible.

594
00:43:53,501 --> 00:43:57,151
- Thank you.
 - Stir it slightly.

595
00:43:59,861 --> 00:44:02,461
- Bite down.
 - It's good.

596
00:44:02,461 --> 00:44:04,831
But how many hours does it take to record this?

597
00:44:04,831 --> 00:44:06,151
Aren't you tired?

598
00:44:06,151 --> 00:44:09,261
I'm tired. It's been tough all by myself.

599
00:44:09,261 --> 00:44:10,601
Shall we take a break?

600
00:44:10,601 --> 00:44:13,811
You should eat and take it easy.

601
00:44:13,811 --> 00:44:17,401
Aigoo, because my daughter takes after me, you're so good at focusing!

602
00:44:17,401 --> 00:44:20,341
Oh, my. Nu Ri takes after me from her head to her toes.

603
00:44:20,341 --> 00:44:22,401
Look at her. She takes after me. She's such a good talker.

604
00:44:22,401 --> 00:44:24,041
Nah, Nu Ri takes after me!

605
00:44:24,041 --> 00:44:26,061
From her looks to her personality.

606
00:44:26,061 --> 00:44:28,471
Should we go out and ask the neighbors now?

607
00:44:28,471 --> 00:44:31,311
That's the funniest thing you've said lately.

608
00:44:31,311 --> 00:44:33,171
- My gosh.
 - It's funny?

609
00:44:33,171 --> 00:44:34,921
I'm half-half.

610
00:44:34,921 --> 00:44:36,411
Half Mom and half Dad.

611
00:44:36,411 --> 00:44:39,671
If I took after you, Dad, I couldn't become a beauty YouTuber.

612
00:44:39,671 --> 00:44:42,321
 All the people in the world! 

613
00:44:42,321 --> 00:44:44,941
 Please make sure there's no one out there who hasn't read "Animal Junction." 

614
00:44:44,941 --> 00:44:48,851
 Well, since it's a number one comic webtoon, I guess everyone has seen it. 

615
00:44:48,950 --> 00:44:52,250
 Of course, not only is he handsome but also the fact that Artist Oh Yun is best at his day job... 

616
00:44:52,250 --> 00:44:55,031
You should stop watching that and talk about work, Artist Oh.

617
00:44:55,031 --> 00:44:56,791
Gosh, one more time...

618
00:44:56,791 --> 00:44:58,521
- One more time.
 - What do you mean, one more time?

619
00:44:58,521 --> 00:45:00,521
Should we watch it two more times?

620
00:45:02,471 --> 00:45:03,981
Maybe it's because of "Animal Junction."

621
00:45:03,981 --> 00:45:06,351
Readers reading "Origin of Mankind" are increasing.

622
00:45:06,351 --> 00:45:07,921
Really?

623
00:45:08,871 --> 00:45:12,281
I'm happy I can gain some attention even with this.

624
00:45:15,731 --> 00:45:18,541
Although it's a little late.

625
00:45:18,541 --> 00:45:20,461
So I was thinking,

626
00:45:20,461 --> 00:45:25,201
what if we rebooted "Origin of Mankind" through Studio Ginger?

627
00:45:25,201 --> 00:45:28,471
You even said we should give up on "Origin of Mankind."

628
00:45:28,471 --> 00:45:31,881
How could a PD give up on a webtoon?

629
00:45:31,881 --> 00:45:35,151
We should just find ways to be loved more.

630
00:45:37,450 --> 00:45:40,450
- That's right. It's our Artist Oh Yun! 
 - I'm Oh Yun.

631
00:45:40,550 --> 00:45:42,750
I'm totally loving "Animal Junction"! It's totally awesome

632
00:45:42,901 --> 00:45:45,021
- Thank you.
 - Your autograph, please...

633
00:45:45,021 --> 00:45:47,371
- What is your name?
 - Lee Gyu Yeon.

634
00:45:47,371 --> 00:45:49,451
Please pull all the way.

635
00:45:49,451 --> 00:45:52,011
Okay, again.

636
00:45:52,050 --> 00:45:54,650
Okay, put it like this... a little

637
00:45:54,731 --> 00:45:56,221
Put your heel on your buttocks.

638
00:45:56,221 --> 00:45:57,931
Stand up as you put your weight forward.

639
00:45:57,931 --> 00:45:59,551
Okay.

640
00:45:59,551 --> 00:46:01,821
Straighten your arms.

641
00:46:03,031 --> 00:46:04,861
Be careful. Careful.

642
00:46:04,861 --> 00:46:07,021
Gosh, slowly.

643
00:46:07,021 --> 00:46:09,351
Mr. Baek.

644
00:46:09,351 --> 00:46:12,051
Welcome.

645
00:46:12,051 --> 00:46:13,961
Come in.

646
00:46:15,061 --> 00:46:16,831
Be careful.

647
00:46:19,301 --> 00:46:22,171
Good, good, good.

648
00:46:24,921 --> 00:46:29,571
Now that I am looking at the end of the dragon series,

649
00:46:29,571 --> 00:46:32,391
I've been thinking about you a lot.

650
00:46:32,391 --> 00:46:33,791
Mr. Baek…

651
00:46:33,791 --> 00:46:39,431
Your sparkling dream was also so precious.

652
00:46:41,791 --> 00:46:45,011
I feel like I couldn't protect that for you.

653
00:46:46,601 --> 00:46:51,291
Mr. Baek, I have a new dream that I'm dreaming of now.

654
00:46:51,291 --> 00:46:53,591
And that makes me happy.

655
00:46:53,591 --> 00:46:58,471
Just because I woke up from a dream, it doesn't mean I can't dream the next day again.

656
00:46:58,471 --> 00:47:00,781
So, rehabilitate well

657
00:47:00,781 --> 00:47:05,701
And give courage to many people who are dreaming dreams.

658
00:47:08,041 --> 00:47:09,701
Thank you.

659
00:47:09,701 --> 00:47:12,361
All right? Thank you.

660
00:47:14,031 --> 00:47:15,351
Thanks.

661
00:47:15,351 --> 00:47:18,951
I hear Artist Baek Eo Jin is coming back soon.

662
00:47:18,951 --> 00:47:20,491
Yes.

663
00:47:20,491 --> 00:47:22,531
He must've been thinking about work while he was on his break.

664
00:47:22,531 --> 00:47:25,471
I believe he'll produce a masterpiece this time.

665
00:47:26,671 --> 00:47:30,241
As you promised, the webtoon team has become stronger.

666
00:47:33,271 --> 00:47:37,361
Isn't that space a little too small for everyone now?

667
00:47:42,451 --> 00:47:44,511
Yes!

668
00:47:44,511 --> 00:47:46,471
 Blazing 

669
00:47:46,471 --> 00:47:47,711
 Tap, tap, tap 

670
00:47:47,711 --> 00:47:49,081
 Squeak 

671
00:47:49,150 --> 00:47:53,750
Artist Im, I received the content

672
00:47:53,750 --> 00:47:58,231
and your character designs are not visually appealing.

673
00:48:01,311 --> 00:48:03,891
Then should I revise them?

674
00:48:03,891 --> 00:48:07,511
Yes, well, that'll be hard, but the result is important.

675
00:48:07,511 --> 00:48:10,311
It looks like you'll have to do that.

676
00:48:10,311 --> 00:48:12,781
I'll adjust the schedule.

677
00:48:12,781 --> 00:48:14,821
Will that be okay?

678
00:48:14,821 --> 00:48:15,951
Yes.

679
00:48:15,951 --> 00:48:17,521
Take care of your health as your work.

680
00:48:17,521 --> 00:48:19,631
Just let me know when you run into any problems.

681
00:48:19,631 --> 00:48:22,081
Okay, thank you, Deputy Editor.

682
00:48:22,081 --> 00:48:24,821
No, no. Just call me PD Kwon.

683
00:48:25,571 --> 00:48:27,231
What?

684
00:48:32,071 --> 00:48:35,721
Then I will contact you when the schedule has been adjusted.

685
00:48:35,721 --> 00:48:37,451
I'm sorry I'm late!

686
00:48:37,451 --> 00:48:40,031
Oh, don't worry about it!

687
00:48:40,031 --> 00:48:42,591
Did you wrap up Artist Na Gang Nam's deadline okay?

688
00:48:42,591 --> 00:48:45,571
Yes, Deputy Editor first time in a while—

689
00:48:45,571 --> 00:48:49,161
I mean, I met with CEO Seok.

690
00:48:49,161 --> 00:48:52,221
It feels weird to call him that.

691
00:48:52,221 --> 00:48:54,711
- You should get used to it.
 - Hello!

692
00:49:02,111 --> 00:49:03,921
Hello…

693
00:49:07,711 --> 00:49:09,871
Are you really Artist Sin Dae Ryuk?

694
00:49:09,871 --> 00:49:11,401
I didn't even recognize you!

695
00:49:11,401 --> 00:49:16,501
Oh, PD On Ma Eum helped me out yesterday.

696
00:49:16,501 --> 00:49:18,021
Do I look okay?

697
00:49:18,021 --> 00:49:20,141
A new dandy oppa is here.

698
00:49:20,141 --> 00:49:23,901
Yes, it is what I recommended, but…

699
00:49:23,901 --> 00:49:25,941
You're Artist Sin Dae Ryuk, right?

700
00:49:25,941 --> 00:49:27,211
Yes, it's me.

701
00:49:27,211 --> 00:49:29,655
Good to see you! You look great!

702
00:49:29,655 --> 00:49:31,435
 With webtoon artists  
 They're so nervous.

703
00:49:31,435 --> 00:49:34,925
Relax and just enjoy.

704
00:49:34,925 --> 00:49:35,765
Then...

705
00:49:35,765 --> 00:49:38,755
Everyone, please relax! Come on, come on!

706
00:49:38,755 --> 00:49:40,385
Fighting! Fighting!

707
00:49:40,385 --> 00:49:43,205
All right. I will begin the live streaming now.

708
00:49:43,205 --> 00:49:45,515
One, two, three.

709
00:49:47,815 --> 00:49:49,815
Hello, this is Webtoon Witch.

710
00:49:49,815 --> 00:49:54,525
We have three popular webtoon artists with us today.

711
00:49:56,175 --> 00:50:00,045
Okay, one person at a time, please introduce yourself.

712
00:50:00,045 --> 00:50:02,605
- Over there?
 - Oh, yes, here.

713
00:50:02,605 --> 00:50:05,485
I'm Lee Wu Jin of "Full Count." Nice to meet you.

714
00:50:05,485 --> 00:50:08,315
Welcome!

715
00:50:09,795 --> 00:50:12,485
I'm Sin Dae Ryuk of "Peeve Weapon."

716
00:50:12,485 --> 00:50:14,335
Hello.

717
00:50:16,145 --> 00:50:20,325
I'm Gu Seul Ah, who draws "Travel Trouble."

718
00:50:22,401 --> 00:50:25,005
The reactions are explosive.

719
00:50:25,005 --> 00:50:28,025
Starting with, "Peeve Weapon is so fun!"

720
00:50:28,025 --> 00:50:33,575
They're saying awesome webtooners are all gathered in one place.

721
00:50:33,575 --> 00:50:36,505
They're saying you're all so pretty and handsome!

722
00:50:36,505 --> 00:50:38,165
Gosh, thank you!

723
00:50:38,165 --> 00:50:41,495
They have it all, don't they? Starting with their drawing talent.

724
00:50:41,495 --> 00:50:43,295
Yes, among them...

725
00:50:43,295 --> 00:50:46,615
I do see a question that caught my eye.

726
00:50:46,615 --> 00:50:49,235
"I want to become a webtoon artist, too.

727
00:50:49,235 --> 00:50:52,585
But I'm not sure if I have the potential."

728
00:50:52,585 --> 00:50:55,945
That's what the person is asking.

729
00:50:55,945 --> 00:50:58,915
It must be quite worrisome.

730
00:50:59,845 --> 00:51:04,035
Artist Seul Ah, I think you and I connected just now.

731
00:51:04,035 --> 00:51:07,745
Would it be okay if I asked you to answer this question?

732
00:51:12,805 --> 00:51:15,695
Of course, it won't be easy.

733
00:51:16,355 --> 00:51:20,785
It could become so difficult that you end up hating the webtoon you loved so much.

734
00:51:20,785 --> 00:51:25,915
You might crumble, realizing how much you lack.

735
00:51:27,015 --> 00:51:31,045
However, if there is a comic you want to draw,

736
00:51:31,045 --> 00:51:33,425
you don't need to be afraid in advance.

737
00:51:33,425 --> 00:51:35,925
If you can try hard as you love it,

738
00:51:35,925 --> 00:51:38,885
your dream will definitely come true.

739
00:51:39,905 --> 00:51:43,755
Everyone, applause.

740
00:51:44,550 --> 00:51:48,350
That was so moving. That was a heartwarming answer.

741
00:51:48,505 --> 00:51:51,785
The questioner also said that was very encouraging.

742
00:51:51,785 --> 00:51:55,185
She also posted thank you.

743
00:51:55,185 --> 00:51:59,185
This is a personal question for me.

744
00:51:59,185 --> 00:52:02,965
You know the webtoon PD that you work with?

745
00:52:02,965 --> 00:52:05,285
Perhaps she annoys you...

746
00:52:05,285 --> 00:52:07,645
I mean, she doesn't even know how to draw.

747
00:52:07,645 --> 00:52:10,365
She doesn't even know much, and it's not like she's giving you ideas.

748
00:52:10,365 --> 00:52:12,225
Why does she act like a know-it-all?

749
00:52:12,225 --> 00:52:14,045
Aren't you annoyed by that?

750
00:52:14,050 --> 00:52:18,550
It's okay, relax.  It's just us here. I mean...

751
00:52:19,375 --> 00:52:23,015
I mean, I do know a webtoon PD.

752
00:52:23,015 --> 00:52:26,995
But that webtoon PD seems so over the top.

753
00:52:28,835 --> 00:52:30,735
Me…

754
00:52:40,315 --> 00:52:41,955
I thought you might.

755
00:52:41,955 --> 00:52:44,695
She's got a hot temper, huh?

756
00:52:44,695 --> 00:52:47,945
Congratulations, Editor Jang Hye Mi!

757
00:52:47,950 --> 00:52:51,450
Someone I know has a CEO title. 
  Studio Ginger, CEO Seok Ji Hyeong 

758
00:52:51,450 --> 00:52:53,875
This is still not enough.

759
00:52:55,355 --> 00:52:58,695
By the way, that Webtoon CEO Kim Yeong Sin

760
00:52:58,695 --> 00:53:00,815
was involved in a scandalous incident recently.

761
00:53:00,815 --> 00:53:02,955
Are you okay with that?

762
00:53:02,955 --> 00:53:05,515
I took that all into account when I said I'll be there.

763
00:53:05,515 --> 00:53:08,695
I'm good at compromising, unlike someone I know.

764
00:53:10,085 --> 00:53:11,745
Young Toon is a good company.

765
00:53:11,745 --> 00:53:14,465
Rather than walking out just because it's not perfect,

766
00:53:14,465 --> 00:53:17,255
I'd like to manage it in a position of power

767
00:53:17,255 --> 00:53:19,865
maintaining balance.

768
00:53:19,865 --> 00:53:22,305
As expected of Jang Hye Mi.

769
00:53:24,345 --> 00:53:26,355
Thanks.

770
00:53:27,935 --> 00:53:29,675
Thank you.

771
00:53:35,995 --> 00:53:38,745
Gosh, what do we do about PD Yu Mi's things?

772
00:53:38,745 --> 00:53:40,605
I think she packed everything already.

773
00:53:40,605 --> 00:53:43,355
How can you go on vacation on the day the office is moving?

774
00:53:43,355 --> 00:53:47,165
Ji Hyeong said he excused her, exercising his last act of authority.

775
00:53:47,165 --> 00:53:49,515
That's why I'm here helping out.

776
00:53:49,515 --> 00:53:50,875
Why have you kept teasing me since earlier?

777
00:53:50,875 --> 00:53:52,945
Is he trying to say I'm not part of Neon anymore?

778
00:53:52,945 --> 00:53:55,915
Because you're like this, CEO.

779
00:53:57,765 --> 00:53:59,015
PD Yu Mi!

780
00:53:59,015 --> 00:54:01,395
I thought you were on vacation!

781
00:54:02,095 --> 00:54:04,365
I can just see PD Choi badmouthing me.

782
00:54:04,365 --> 00:54:07,175
I came straight from the airport.

783
00:54:07,175 --> 00:54:09,205
But your vacation...

784
00:54:11,185 --> 00:54:13,635
Everyone's here. Let's wrap up.

785
00:54:13,635 --> 00:54:16,125
Be sure to take the lizard.

786
00:54:16,125 --> 00:54:17,705
Should I take that off now?

787
00:54:17,705 --> 00:54:19,585
We should.

788
00:54:24,175 --> 00:54:27,625
Should I take this down? 
  Let's go! To Neon Headquarters! 

789
00:54:27,625 --> 00:54:29,715
Take it down!

790
00:54:31,830 --> 00:54:37,400
 Let's go! To Neon Headquarters! 

791
00:54:37,405 --> 00:54:39,575
 Right side higher. A little higher. 

792
00:54:39,650 --> 00:54:42,750
 - It's fine. 
 - That's it. 

793
00:54:42,795 --> 00:54:45,205
 I said I'd do it, yet you had to get up there yourself. 

794
00:54:45,205 --> 00:54:47,745
 Do we have to put this up on the wall? 

795
00:54:47,745 --> 00:54:49,835
 It's like a cartoon. 

796
00:54:49,835 --> 00:54:51,565
 Cartoon? 

797
00:54:51,565 --> 00:54:56,095
 When unrealistic things happen for real in life, people say it's like a cartoon. 

798
00:54:56,095 --> 00:55:00,415
 But those cartoon-like things that happen feel like a dream come true to me. 

799
00:55:00,415 --> 00:55:02,335
 Let's go! To Neon Headquarters! 

800
00:55:02,335 --> 00:55:05,325
 Was going to Neon Headquarters that desperate a dream? 

801
00:55:05,325 --> 00:55:06,425
 No. 

802
00:55:06,425 --> 00:55:12,315
 My true dire dream is delivering good cartoons to many more people. 

803
00:55:12,315 --> 00:55:16,135
 I get to do such worthy work with you, which makes me happy.   

804
00:55:16,135 --> 00:55:17,775
 Gosh, so cringy. 

805
00:55:17,775 --> 00:55:20,185
 - Gosh, what the...
 - Cringy, huh? 

806
00:55:20,185 --> 00:55:22,405
 How could you say that aloud? 

807
00:55:23,435 --> 00:55:25,255
 Nice… 

808
00:55:28,455 --> 00:55:29,945
Look at this, everyone!

809
00:55:29,945 --> 00:55:32,335
A cartoon-like thing really happened!

810
00:55:32,335 --> 00:55:34,205
Gosh, what's wrong with you, Hyeong?

811
00:55:34,205 --> 00:55:36,245
I'm allowed to act like this today.

812
00:55:36,245 --> 00:55:38,375
Hyeong, you're like this every day.

813
00:55:40,825 --> 00:55:43,435
Oh, in any case, what will you do now?

814
00:55:43,435 --> 00:55:44,865
You've achieved your dream.

815
00:55:44,865 --> 00:55:46,905
There's no rule that says I only get to dream once.

816
00:55:46,905 --> 00:55:49,755
I'm already dreaming my next dream.

817
00:55:50,365 --> 00:55:53,035
Since we got to move to the headquarters as the top of the industry in the nation,

818
00:55:53,035 --> 00:55:56,065
we should now go for number one globally.

819
00:55:57,625 --> 00:56:00,095
Going global is our goal!

820
00:56:00,095 --> 00:56:02,765
Great, friend! Let's go!

821
00:56:04,405 --> 00:56:05,565
Hey!

822
00:56:05,565 --> 00:56:08,115
Why are you doing that, too?

823
00:56:08,115 --> 00:56:10,085
- Let's hurry and go. 
- Okay!

824
00:56:10,085 --> 00:56:12,195
- Will you carry mine?
 - Sure, I'll carry it.

825
00:56:12,195 --> 00:56:14,275
Thank you!

826
00:56:14,275 --> 00:56:16,080
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

827
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:20,230

828
00:56:20,230 --> 00:56:24,340

829
00:56:24,340 --> 00:56:29,410

830
00:56:29,410 --> 00:56:34,330

831
00:56:35,210 --> 00:56:37,375
Gosh, how refreshing!

832
00:56:37,375 --> 00:56:40,815
Do you really feel refreshed?

833
00:56:40,815 --> 00:56:42,985
We're finally going over there.

834
00:56:42,985 --> 00:56:45,625
We'll get to eat comfortably now.

835
00:56:45,625 --> 00:56:48,545
How come it's so tough to cross one street?

836
00:56:48,545 --> 00:56:50,815
Jun Yeong, do you remember that time?

837
00:56:50,815 --> 00:56:52,515
We came to work together on our first day.

838
00:56:52,515 --> 00:56:54,675
Oh! Yeah, yeah, right!

839
00:56:54,675 --> 00:56:58,305
You thought I was following you that day. You had misunderstood me.

840
00:56:58,305 --> 00:57:01,075
Hey, as for that... I mean, that's because...

841
00:57:01,075 --> 00:57:03,235
Hey, why are you carrying so many boxes by yourself?

842
00:57:03,235 --> 00:57:05,485
- Give it. Give it to me.
 - Forget it. Stop that.

843
00:57:05,485 --> 00:57:07,675
Why? Did you think I fell for you?

844
00:57:07,675 --> 00:57:10,715
I guess that must happen a lot for you, Jun Yeong.

845
00:57:11,881 --> 00:57:14,064
I'm the one who fell for you.

846
00:57:14,064 --> 00:57:16,684
I'm still waiting for your answer.

847
00:57:20,915 --> 00:57:25,465
What kind of person is On Ma Eum, according to Gu Jun Yeong?

848
00:57:25,465 --> 00:57:27,735
A good person.

849
00:57:29,185 --> 00:57:33,145
And someone I like.

850
00:57:36,735 --> 00:57:38,935
I like you.

851
00:57:42,295 --> 00:57:45,595
I can't say when, but it just happened.

852
00:57:47,715 --> 00:57:52,945
You don't have to give me an answer right now.

853
00:57:55,135 --> 00:57:58,215
I'll wait even if it takes some time.

854
00:58:07,935 --> 00:58:11,490
A-Answer... wh-why...

855
00:58:11,490 --> 00:58:14,420
♫  The day is caught in the middle  ♫

856
00:58:14,420 --> 00:58:17,330
♫  Surrounded by empty bottles  ♫

857
00:58:17,330 --> 00:58:18,820
♫  Singing songs of our own  ♫

858
00:58:18,820 --> 00:58:23,995
 Everyone creates their own stories every day. 

859
00:58:23,995 --> 00:58:28,885
 Some days, you think you've gone down the wrong path, 

860
00:58:30,405 --> 00:58:34,305
 yet it becomes your path after a few days. 
  

861
00:58:34,305 --> 00:58:40,545
 I will do twice or three times better so that this team doesn't vanish. 

862
00:58:40,545 --> 00:58:45,235
 Even if you'd be abandoned after a year? 

863
00:58:45,235 --> 00:58:48,060
 Since we can change the future. 

864
00:58:48,060 --> 00:58:51,340
♫  Just call me baby like you used to do  ♫

865
00:58:51,340 --> 00:58:57,245
 One may stagger yet still walk down the path  

866
00:58:57,245 --> 00:59:02,988
 that one has been dreaming of for a long time, every day, step by step, all the way. 

867
00:59:02,988 --> 00:59:08,340
 'Hope' is something you could protect. 

868
00:59:16,840 --> 00:59:21,085
 At times, at at crossroads you have to make a choice 

869
00:59:21,085 --> 00:59:26,515
 and come up with your own story day by day. 

870
00:59:26,515 --> 00:59:30,130
 Because life is a full-length novel. 

871
00:59:32,395 --> 00:59:34,350
What is she looking at?

872
00:59:34,350 --> 00:59:41,700
♫  cuz you know we know we know (I know I know}  ♫
