 Today's Webtoon 

3
00:00:44,977 --> 00:00:47,023
"Peeve Weapon" can't afford to waver.

4
00:00:47,023 --> 00:00:49,783
If there's no manuscript, that means there'll be a break.

5
00:00:49,783 --> 00:00:51,076
The responses will be bad.

6
00:00:51,076 --> 00:00:55,126
And it might cause a misunderstanding because of that incident.

7
00:01:16,243 --> 00:01:18,433
I just shared the folder with you.

 Peeve Weapon Episode 7 Manuscript 

11
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:37,803
Yes, Artist Sin.

12
00:01:37,803 --> 00:01:39,403
Yes, I just sent you the manuscript.

13
00:01:39,403 --> 00:01:40,573
 Peeve Weapon Episode 7 Manuscript 

14
00:01:40,573 --> 00:01:41,713
Yes, I got your email.

15
00:01:41,713 --> 00:01:44,303
I'll check and upload the files. Yes.

16
00:01:44,303 --> 00:01:47,233
I just checked Artist Sin Dae Ryuk's manuscript!

17
00:01:47,233 --> 00:01:50,713
First, send it over to the copy editing team, double-check it and upload it.

18
00:01:50,713 --> 00:01:52,223
Okay.

19
00:01:54,223 --> 00:01:56,223
 "Peeve Weapon" Episode 7 is attached 

20
00:02:06,693 --> 00:02:07,943
 Email sent 

21
00:02:10,883 --> 00:02:13,593
I sent it over to the copy editing team.

22
00:02:14,203 --> 00:02:16,173
Good work.

23
00:02:19,423 --> 00:02:21,113
 Episode 7 

24
00:02:21,723 --> 00:02:23,723
It's been uploaded!

25
00:02:24,473 --> 00:02:27,013
 11 p.m. "Peeve Weapon" posted 

26
00:02:27,013 --> 00:02:28,593
 Peeve Weapon 

27
00:02:30,493 --> 00:02:33,913
 An ending is the beginning of another "hope" 

28
00:02:36,223 --> 00:02:38,653
 An ending is the beginning of another "hope" 

29
00:02:40,453 --> 00:02:44,843
 So, is this place okay to stay? 

30
00:02:44,843 --> 00:02:48,473
 Just ... I don't think much.  I'm always that way. 

31
00:02:52,303 --> 00:02:55,100
 Look at this Hwi Yeong. Not only has a truly beautiful flower bloomed in a really unexpected place. 

32
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:57,600
 We call that hope. 

33
00:03:03,513 --> 00:03:05,793
 Hope... 

34
00:03:13,653 --> 00:03:16,903
 'Hope' is something you could protect. 

35
00:03:25,543 --> 00:03:28,953
'Hope' is something you could protect.

36
00:03:34,843 --> 00:03:36,883
PD On,

37
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:39,663
This is Artist Sin's manuscript, right?

38
00:03:43,093 --> 00:03:46,953
Artist Sin must've matured just as much as he suffered.

39
00:03:47,813 --> 00:03:49,833
You, too, PD On.

40
00:03:54,643 --> 00:03:58,873
- Gosh, I'm so sorryâ€”
 - Good work, everyone!

41
00:03:58,873 --> 00:04:01,023
Gosh, go home, everyone.

42
00:04:01,023 --> 00:04:05,353
You should enjoy a break on deadline days, at least. Hurry up and go.

43
00:04:05,353 --> 00:04:08,243
I'll get going then. Good work.

44
00:04:08,873 --> 00:04:10,203
Good work!

45
00:04:10,203 --> 00:04:11,453
Good work!

46
00:04:11,453 --> 00:04:13,113
- Thank you! 
- Good work!

47
00:04:13,113 --> 00:04:14,793
Good job.

48
00:04:17,043 --> 00:04:18,723
Let's go.

49
00:04:21,233 --> 00:04:23,193
Good job.

50
00:04:27,713 --> 00:04:31,803
I'm sorry. It was my fault for putting you in a bind.

51
00:04:31,803 --> 00:04:34,693
I-I was too reckless.

52
00:04:34,693 --> 00:04:38,023
I... am grateful to you.

53
00:04:38,023 --> 00:04:41,033
Thanks to you, I think I've learned to be a team player.

54
00:04:43,315 --> 00:04:46,863
After my one and only support Noona passed away,

55
00:04:46,863 --> 00:04:50,303
I believed that it was right to live only trusting myself.

56
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:52,243
In this team,

57
00:04:52,243 --> 00:04:58,823
I feel like I'm relearning things that I had intentionally forgotten.

58
00:04:59,593 --> 00:05:02,533
So, if this is what I have to handle,

59
00:05:02,533 --> 00:05:05,153
I'd rather choose the side where I have to be accountable.

60
00:05:08,253 --> 00:05:10,003
It's interesting.

61
00:05:10,003 --> 00:05:11,793
You and me.

62
00:05:11,793 --> 00:05:13,673
We were so different before.

63
00:05:13,673 --> 00:05:18,853
You were at the end of that end there, and I was right over there.

64
00:05:20,033 --> 00:05:23,383
But we meet right here.

65
00:05:23,383 --> 00:05:25,283
You were North, and I was South.

66
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:30,103
Because we were so different, I think we're able to meet so nicely like this.

67
00:05:31,033 --> 00:05:33,203
Why? What? Is it too sentimental?

68
00:05:33,203 --> 00:05:34,633
No.

69
00:05:35,403 --> 00:05:38,853
If we got to meet because my polar opposite was you,

70
00:05:38,853 --> 00:05:41,493
then I'm glad I lived like that.

71
00:05:48,783 --> 00:05:51,963
Hey! You're even more sentimental!

72
00:05:51,963 --> 00:05:54,023
My gosh!

73
00:05:54,023 --> 00:05:57,063
We're having a sentimentalist contest today.

74
00:05:57,063 --> 00:06:00,643
Gosh, but still... one task wrapped up nicely.

75
00:06:00,643 --> 00:06:01,953
We'll have to grab a drink.

76
00:06:01,953 --> 00:06:04,433
You can't even drink!

77
00:06:04,433 --> 00:06:06,080
You're such a bluffer!

78
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:12,993
-  I'm home.  
 - Hey, you're home.

79
00:06:12,993 --> 00:06:14,863
Eonni, the new episode of Peeve Weapon is up.

80
00:06:14,863 --> 00:06:17,643
The reaction is totally hot.

81
00:06:17,643 --> 00:06:19,503
Oh, really?

82
00:06:19,503 --> 00:06:21,953
Guess what Dad is doing right now.

83
00:06:21,953 --> 00:06:23,733
What is he doing?

84
00:06:23,733 --> 00:06:25,553
Let's go upstairs.

85
00:06:25,553 --> 00:06:27,943
Let's go upstairs.

86
00:06:35,393 --> 00:06:37,413
I'm going crazy here.

87
00:06:40,033 --> 00:06:42,993
D-Dad, are you crying?

88
00:06:43,873 --> 00:06:46,243
Who's crying?

89
00:06:47,533 --> 00:06:51,313
Were you... reading... our webtoon?

90
00:06:51,313 --> 00:06:54,133
I was wondering what you were doing running around.

91
00:06:55,223 --> 00:06:56,663
Pretty amazing.

92
00:06:56,663 --> 00:06:58,883
Can't believe you worked on this.

93
00:06:58,883 --> 00:07:01,163
All you ever did was judo.

94
00:07:03,203 --> 00:07:05,103
It's tough, huh?

95
00:07:06,073 --> 00:07:08,123
Of course, it's tough.

96
00:07:09,483 --> 00:07:14,413
But... Dad, where I am right now... if I put all my heart*
  (On Ma Eum in Korean means "all my heart") 

97
00:07:14,413 --> 00:07:19,923
and all my strength into this work more and more...

98
00:07:19,923 --> 00:07:22,513
more people become happy.

99
00:07:22,513 --> 00:07:27,593
Each and every moment is a fight, but no one ever gets hurt.

100
00:07:27,593 --> 00:07:30,793
I'm so relieved by that, so no matter how tough it gets,

101
00:07:30,793 --> 00:07:34,213
I can work harder and harder each and every day.

102
00:07:37,573 --> 00:07:39,053
What are you doing?

103
00:07:39,053 --> 00:07:40,353
Don't be silly!

104
00:07:40,353 --> 00:07:42,633
- Come over here!
 - What's up with you now?

105
00:07:45,523 --> 00:07:47,173
Get away from him!

106
00:07:47,173 --> 00:07:49,113
Dad!

107
00:08:00,393 --> 00:08:02,153
Based on our research,

108
00:08:02,153 --> 00:08:06,083
the circumstances surrounding the recent post are strange.

109
00:08:06,083 --> 00:08:07,773
What's so strange about it?

110
00:08:07,773 --> 00:08:11,953
I heard that the one who posted said something strange when he met with my staff.

111
00:08:11,953 --> 00:08:16,673
Someone who knew of the incident asked him to do it and that's why he posted it.

112
00:08:16,673 --> 00:08:18,773
Along with a guarantee that it wouldn't be problematic,

113
00:08:18,773 --> 00:08:23,023
even if he posted a false story.

114
00:08:33,743 --> 00:08:35,363
I'm back!

115
00:08:35,363 --> 00:08:37,693
You're back.

116
00:08:37,693 --> 00:08:39,633
So, did it get resolved?

117
00:08:39,633 --> 00:08:41,493
Yeah.

118
00:08:41,493 --> 00:08:45,693
She said all the things we're planning are looking good. She says good luck.

119
00:08:45,693 --> 00:08:47,933
- What a relief!
 - So I was thinking,

120
00:08:47,933 --> 00:08:49,953
what do you think about putting together a contest?

121
00:08:49,953 --> 00:08:51,443
A contest?

122
00:08:51,443 --> 00:08:53,293
Right before the executives' meeting?

123
00:08:53,293 --> 00:08:55,673
There were quite a lot of issues surrounding Neon Webtoon.

124
00:08:55,673 --> 00:08:58,973
We can appeal to our audience with some good things at a time like this,

125
00:08:58,973 --> 00:09:03,073
and I think it'll be good if we can tie it to the new company and work on developing them.

126
00:09:03,073 --> 00:09:04,813
- I think that'd be great.
 - Right?

127
00:09:04,813 --> 00:09:06,283
I'm good here.

128
00:09:06,283 --> 00:09:08,693
I'm good here, too.

129
00:09:08,693 --> 00:09:10,883
Okay. We're all doing well.

130
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:14,323
Let's work a little harder to the end with a fighting spirit.

131
00:09:14,323 --> 00:09:16,783
- Fighting!
 - Fighting!

132
00:09:17,863 --> 00:09:21,243
Your mother is doing well at the hospital.

133
00:09:21,243 --> 00:09:24,283
Thank you, PD On.

134
00:09:27,243 --> 00:09:30,473
I think my job is over now.

135
00:09:30,473 --> 00:09:32,843
Dae Ryuk's work has stabilized now.

136
00:09:32,843 --> 00:09:36,713
I was so grateful for you, Artist Dong Hui.

137
00:09:36,713 --> 00:09:42,003
You were so, so, so big a help for Artist Sin as well as for me.

138
00:09:42,003 --> 00:09:43,993
Thank you so much.

139
00:09:45,843 --> 00:09:49,583
Thank you... so much, Hyeong.

140
00:09:51,533 --> 00:09:55,753
I was so shocked when you asked me to teach you how to add color.

141
00:09:55,753 --> 00:10:00,223
I'll watch you intently going forward and see if you're doing a good job.

142
00:10:00,223 --> 00:10:03,513
Speaking of, you have no idea how shocked I was

143
00:10:04,203 --> 00:10:06,633
when I saw that manuscript.

144
00:10:06,633 --> 00:10:11,353
How did you think of working on a color manuscript?

145
00:10:26,593 --> 00:10:28,783
It's so pretty.

146
00:10:28,783 --> 00:10:30,633
 I remember it. 

147
00:10:30,633 --> 00:10:34,863
 The moment in my life that wasn't in black and white. 

148
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:42,753
I had forgotten that I had such a memory.

149
00:10:48,513 --> 00:10:51,343
I learned a lot through the recent incident.

150
00:10:51,343 --> 00:10:53,703
It's all thanks to both of you.

151
00:10:53,703 --> 00:10:55,693
Thank you for everything.

152
00:10:56,913 --> 00:11:02,693
You can't forget Artist Sin, in your journey, the webtoon team members

153
00:11:02,693 --> 00:11:06,643
and hearts of numerous readers are with you

154
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:11,700
and that you're never alone.

155
00:11:13,373 --> 00:11:14,813
Okay.

156
00:11:29,513 --> 00:11:31,453
Artist Sin...

157
00:11:31,453 --> 00:11:34,823
You saw that, right? You saw that. One more time!

158
00:11:35,793 --> 00:11:39,213
- Whoa, Artist Sin!
 - Can you do that with me, too?

159
00:11:41,243 --> 00:11:43,963
 1. Company Overview, 2. Current Business Trend, 3. Market Analysis... 

160
00:11:43,963 --> 00:11:46,643
 1. Company Overview 

161
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:53,300
- I'm back! 
 - Hey!

162
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:55,643
Deputy Editor, you must be swamped.

163
00:11:55,643 --> 00:11:56,853
Coming from somewhere?

164
00:11:56,853 --> 00:11:59,463
Artist Dong Hui is headed home. So I went to say bye.

165
00:11:59,463 --> 00:12:01,643
He really went through a lot all this time.

166
00:12:01,643 --> 00:12:04,563
- Did you eat? 
 - No.

167
00:12:04,563 --> 00:12:07,213
- Did you eat, Deputy Editor? 
- I haven't eaten, either.

168
00:12:07,213 --> 00:12:08,863
Oh, yay!

169
00:12:08,863 --> 00:12:11,903
- Should we just go eat? 
- Would love to!

170
00:12:15,223 --> 00:12:16,853
There was still a place like this around?

171
00:12:16,853 --> 00:12:18,093
I know, right?

172
00:12:18,093 --> 00:12:20,573
The tteokbokki place that I used to go to with my friends in my childhood

173
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:23,823
also had walls you could write on.

174
00:12:28,903 --> 00:12:30,923
- Should we try it, too? 
 - Us too?

175
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
- Yeah. 
 - Sure.

176
00:12:33,003 --> 00:12:36,643
So, it'd be too trite to just write our names.

177
00:12:36,643 --> 00:12:38,333
How about we draw each other?

178
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:40,513
- Draw? 
- Yes.

179
00:12:41,493 --> 00:12:43,233
Sure.

180
00:13:16,583 --> 00:13:19,423
- It's cute. 
- What?

181
00:13:19,423 --> 00:13:21,643
Deputy Editor, your drawing is so expressiveâ€”

182
00:13:21,643 --> 00:13:23,733
You draw so well!

183
00:13:23,733 --> 00:13:27,453
Didn't I ever tell you that I wanted to me a cartoonist as a child?

184
00:13:27,453 --> 00:13:29,343
Really?

185
00:13:29,343 --> 00:13:32,753
No wonder you draw so well like a cartoonist.

186
00:13:32,753 --> 00:13:34,983
I'm not that good.

187
00:13:34,983 --> 00:13:38,713
I know I'm not that good. That's why I became an editor.

188
00:13:38,713 --> 00:13:42,053
I read this in a book a while ago.

189
00:13:42,053 --> 00:13:46,643
People like me are called "shadow artists."

190
00:13:46,643 --> 00:13:48,003
Shadow artists?

191
00:13:48,003 --> 00:13:52,043
Well, kind of like I want to create something,

192
00:13:52,043 --> 00:13:54,973
but I'm too afraid to become an artist.

193
00:13:54,973 --> 00:13:58,823
So, I choose to become a shadow to them.

194
00:14:00,353 --> 00:14:03,173
When I first read that,

195
00:14:03,173 --> 00:14:07,213
I felt somewhat disturbed and also felt guilty.

196
00:14:07,213 --> 00:14:09,113
But while working,

197
00:14:09,113 --> 00:14:13,290
my thoughts about being a shadow changed.

198
00:14:16,113 --> 00:14:18,863
 For one creative work of art to come out into the world, 

199
00:14:18,863 --> 00:14:22,423
 you can't do it with only one artist's effort. 

200
00:14:22,423 --> 00:14:24,433
 Even if his name isn't on the front page, 

201
00:14:24,433 --> 00:14:27,843
 what's worse, even if people aren't aware of his existence, 

202
00:14:27,843 --> 00:14:29,843
 he'd gladly become a shadow 

203
00:14:29,843 --> 00:14:33,883
 to support the artist, which is necessary. 

204
00:14:33,883 --> 00:14:37,393
â™«  Baby that's the way I live the other day all on my own  â™«

205
00:14:37,393 --> 00:14:40,160
â™«  I'm telling you to say the word  â™«

206
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,100
â™«  Just call me baby like you used to doâ€Ž  â™«

207
00:14:42,103 --> 00:14:46,193
 It's not much, but it brought me much comfort. 

208
00:14:46,193 --> 00:14:50,103
 I hope it becomes a good friend to you as well. 

209
00:14:50,103 --> 00:14:51,793
 Thank you. 

210
00:14:51,793 --> 00:14:56,263
 I think perhaps you need more courage and devotion 

211
00:14:56,263 --> 00:14:59,493
 than deciding to become an artist. 

212
00:14:59,493 --> 00:15:01,143
 All the luck that I have, 

213
00:15:01,143 --> 00:15:05,233
 I'd like to give it all to you, Artist Sin Dae Ryuk. 

214
00:15:05,943 --> 00:15:08,203
 When you're by my side, PD On, 

215
00:15:08,203 --> 00:15:12,043
 I think I can escape bad luck and misfortune. 

216
00:15:12,043 --> 00:15:14,690
 'Hope' is something you could protect. 
 â™«  The storm looks bright like a rainbow  â™« 

217
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:17,900
â™«  With city lights on the window  â™« 
 You're right.

218
00:15:17,923 --> 00:15:20,073
But in the beginning,

219
00:15:20,073 --> 00:15:25,603
I had my doubts as to whether or not you were a suitable person

220
00:15:25,603 --> 00:15:30,093
to be an editor since you would've always received support as an athlete.

221
00:15:30,093 --> 00:15:34,343
 The editor said that he saw something in you. 

222
00:15:34,343 --> 00:15:38,573
 But I have no idea what he's talking about. 

223
00:15:38,573 --> 00:15:40,463
 So, show me from now on 

224
00:15:40,463 --> 00:15:44,163
 that I'm wrong about you. 

225
00:15:44,163 --> 00:15:46,583
And you show it to me every time.

226
00:15:46,583 --> 00:15:48,660
Very dynamically at that.

227
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:52,680
â™«  No matter where you go or what you doâ€Ž  â™«

228
00:15:52,683 --> 00:15:54,203
Thank you

229
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:57,000
for letting me find out that I was wrong.

230
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:03,900
â™«   It's alright alright alright alright alright alright alright alright alright  â™«

231
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:06,823
Going forward,

232
00:16:06,823 --> 00:16:10,512
you'll continue to do a good job, right?  
 â™«   Oh darling, I will save your day â™«

233
00:16:10,512 --> 00:16:15,072
- No.
 - Huh? 
 â™«  And let you know how much I care for you   â™«

234
00:16:15,072 --> 00:16:20,173
I'll work even harder and harder and harder than now.

235
00:16:20,173 --> 00:16:21,663
As for doing well,

236
00:16:21,663 --> 00:16:25,513
I'll just do a little bit better.

237
00:16:25,513 --> 00:16:30,333
- Just a little bit?
 - Teeny tiny bit.

238
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:31,553
Okay. Just do teeny tiny bit better.

239
00:16:31,553 --> 00:16:32,520

 "Peeve Weapon" Dramatization Contract

 Weekly webtoon user increase after the release of "Peeve Weapon" 

243

 Signing of the "Peeve Weapon" Dramatization Contract Completed 

244
00:16:42,553 --> 00:16:45,683
I'll have to look into it...

245
00:16:47,893 --> 00:16:51,153
 Neon Webtoon Contest Announcement 

246
00:16:58,213 --> 00:16:59,883
Here you go, Chief.

247
00:16:59,883 --> 00:17:01,353
Oh, good work.

248
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:03,163
I put all the information you mentioned in it.

249
00:17:03,163 --> 00:17:05,153
Let me know if you need anything else.

250
00:17:05,153 --> 00:17:07,453
Thanks. I'll look it over.

251

 Plan for establishing Studio Ginger 

252
00:17:10,033 --> 00:17:12,653
 Studio Ginger Organizational Structure 

253
00:17:14,053 --> 00:17:16,683
Once they pass the preliminary,

254
00:17:16,683 --> 00:17:18,433
and for the second round...

255
00:17:18,433 --> 00:17:20,733
The important thing here is...

256
00:17:20,733 --> 00:17:24,443
We can put the number of users here.

257
00:17:24,443 --> 00:17:27,403
And we can adjust the schedule for the second season,

258
00:17:27,403 --> 00:17:29,743
and that would be a sure way to...

259
00:17:29,743 --> 00:17:31,063
Oh, sounds good.

260
00:17:31,063 --> 00:17:34,013
If we put that in there...

261
00:17:34,013 --> 00:17:36,153
- Right, right.
 - We can use that.

262
00:17:36,153 --> 00:17:38,103
Right on.

263
00:17:45,543 --> 00:17:48,173
 - Welcome! 
 - Over here.

264
00:17:49,313 --> 00:17:50,943
Why did you want to meet here?

265
00:17:50,943 --> 00:17:54,083
This is the Webtoon Service Team's hangout, isn't it?

266
00:17:54,083 --> 00:17:56,423
I was always curious about it.

267
00:17:56,423 --> 00:17:58,613
They have really good fresh live octopus.

268
00:17:58,613 --> 00:18:00,623
How nice.

269
00:18:18,563 --> 00:18:20,093
Yes.

270
00:18:26,463 --> 00:18:28,463
Is the prep for the executives' meeting going well?

271
00:18:28,463 --> 00:18:32,583
We're doing our best for the time remaining.

272
00:18:32,583 --> 00:18:34,943
You remember the promise from back then, don't you?

273
00:18:35,653 --> 00:18:37,253
 Continuation of employment. 

274
00:18:37,253 --> 00:18:41,123
 Additionally, you want me to even rehire an employee who was laid off. 

275
00:18:41,123 --> 00:18:45,223
 Why should I have to accept that condition? 

276
00:18:45,223 --> 00:18:48,923
 I'll make us the top-notch company within three years. 

277
00:18:48,923 --> 00:18:54,626
 If I don't achieve that, I'll let everything go and leave. 

278
00:18:54,626 --> 00:18:57,553
 I don't like to bargain with people on the line. 

279
00:18:57,553 --> 00:19:01,323
 The people whom I'm putting on the line are more precious than life to me. 

280
00:19:01,323 --> 00:19:03,253
 That's why. 

281
00:19:03,253 --> 00:19:07,293
 It means I'll put my life on the line and work hard. 

282
00:19:09,343 --> 00:19:11,073
That's that.

283
00:19:11,073 --> 00:19:15,933
Why did you accept such a reckless condition back then?

284
00:19:15,933 --> 00:19:19,833
That was a short time after I had become a CEO.

285
00:19:19,833 --> 00:19:25,113
I wanted to learn from you, Team Leader Jang Man Cheol.

286
00:19:25,113 --> 00:19:27,643
You seemed like a very cool leader.

287
00:19:29,143 --> 00:19:32,323
And I also wanted to teach you.

288
00:19:33,323 --> 00:19:38,223
A leader should become powerful, not just be cool.

289
00:19:46,993 --> 00:19:48,413
I look forward to tomorrow.

290
00:19:48,413 --> 00:19:50,823
I'll do my best!

291
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:07,170
â™«  I'm walking, I'm walking down the street   â™«

292
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:11,560
â™«  I walked the fastest  â™«

293
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:17,650
â™«  I'm running, I'm running down the street.  â™«

294
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:20,403
Mom!
 â™«  I'm going to confidently open the path  â™«

295
00:20:20,403 --> 00:20:24,013
- Did you make seaweed soup?
- Yeah. / (A superstition that slippery seaweed soup will cause exam answers to slip away.)

296
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:27,993
Why? 
â™«  With no end in sight  â™«

297
00:20:27,993 --> 00:20:30,403
Soup is just soup. 
â™«  Today opens a another day.  â™«

298
00:20:30,403 --> 00:20:31,813
Soup is just soup.
â™«    â™«

299
00:20:31,813 --> 00:20:34,283
What's wrong with her? By the way, where did you go this morning?

300
00:20:34,283 --> 00:20:37,093
Eonni has been sweeping in front of our house every morning lately.

301
00:20:37,093 --> 00:20:40,683
Not just in front of our house. I swept even the streets over there early this morning.

302
00:20:40,683 --> 00:20:42,523
Eonni has been doing this every day lately.

303
00:20:42,523 --> 00:20:47,543
She says her work will go over well if she does good deeds or something like that.

304
00:20:47,543 --> 00:20:48,823
Wait a minute.

305
00:20:48,823 --> 00:20:50,223
By chance, is today D-day?

306
00:20:50,223 --> 00:20:51,423
Yeah!

307
00:20:51,423 --> 00:20:54,850
The company president wouldn't even do what you do.

308
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:57,693
â™«  The many obstacles which blocked you have all disappeared  â™«

309
00:20:57,693 --> 00:21:01,600
Sorry. We should gather all our hearts and devotion.

310
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,640
â™«  Come to me at least once  â™«

311
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,023
Rice cake? Do you have any rice cake?

312
00:21:05,023 --> 00:21:06,463
I have some sticky rice cake (to help exam answers "stick").

313
00:21:06,463 --> 00:21:08,033
Oh, good, good.

314
00:21:08,033 --> 00:21:10,700
- Really?
 - My gosh!

315
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:14,330
 To counter the slippery seaweed something sticky to eat is needed to make "knowledge stick" so you won't fail an exam. 

316
00:21:25,933 --> 00:21:27,933
I'll be back.

317
00:21:27,933 --> 00:21:29,623
- Have a good meeting, Chief.
 - Good luck.

318
00:21:29,623 --> 00:21:31,633
See you later.

319
00:21:35,553 --> 00:21:37,653
Thanks, everyone.

00:21:40,703 --> 00:21:42,393
Fighting!

321
00:21:43,403 --> 00:21:45,393
I'll be back.

322
00:22:54,013 --> 00:22:55,583
I'll take this back.

323
00:22:55,583 --> 00:22:57,373
It was mine, to begin with.

324
00:22:57,373 --> 00:22:58,703
What?

325
00:22:58,703 --> 00:23:01,823
Why? Do you still need it?

326
00:23:03,433 --> 00:23:06,463
Let's just believe, since we've done what we could,

327
00:23:06,463 --> 00:23:10,443
that good luck is always on our side.

328
00:23:17,993 --> 00:23:21,223
 Neon 

329
00:23:21,753 --> 00:23:23,723
Currently, "Peeve Weapon"

330
00:23:23,723 --> 00:23:27,433
is under a dramatization contract with Director Sin Ji Won, a hitmaker,

331
00:23:27,433 --> 00:23:30,533
and has produced the first step for IP (intellectual property) expansion.

332
00:23:30,533 --> 00:23:32,883
It is being produced as a series for a global OTT platform, so

333
00:23:32,883 --> 00:23:35,343
we anticipate huge marketing and promotional efforts.

334
00:23:35,343 --> 00:23:38,393
And if we produce season two, aligning the time frame with the drama,

335
00:23:38,393 --> 00:23:41,113
we can even aim for second IP expansion efforts.

336
00:23:41,113 --> 00:23:43,713
At such a crucial time as this,

337
00:23:43,713 --> 00:23:46,233
if a reckless plan to take over Young Toon

338
00:23:46,233 --> 00:23:48,243
jeopardizes our current plan,

339
00:23:48,243 --> 00:23:52,153
it will be a huge loss for Neon as a company.

340
00:23:52,153 --> 00:23:55,783
The work could continue even if the people change.

341
00:23:55,783 --> 00:23:58,243
I'm sure the PDs at Young Toon, who are at the top of their field,

342
00:23:58,243 --> 00:24:01,873
couldn't be worse than Neon PDs, right?

343
00:24:01,873 --> 00:24:06,893
In our Neon Webtoon, our work is based on bonding relationships between the

344
00:24:06,893 --> 00:24:09,093
PDs in charge and the artists.

345
00:24:09,093 --> 00:24:12,693
Artist Sin Dae Ryuk was personally discovered by PD On Ma Eum.

346
00:24:12,693 --> 00:24:16,283
As such, they have a much more dependent and trusting relationship.

347
00:24:16,283 --> 00:24:18,323
If the PD in charge were to change,

348
00:24:18,323 --> 00:24:22,553
season two of "Peeve Weapon" could be canceled entirely.

349
00:24:22,553 --> 00:24:24,633
What is the current profit for "Peeve Weapon"?

350
00:24:24,633 --> 00:24:26,263
It's one billion won per month.

351
00:24:26,263 --> 00:24:29,663
That amount excludes additional profits made from sales of goods or IP businesses.

352
00:24:29,663 --> 00:24:34,743
Then you can't ignore the projected profit from season two, either.

353
00:24:34,743 --> 00:24:36,543
That's right.

354
00:24:40,013 --> 00:24:44,343
I mean, webtoon dramatizations have always happened.

355
00:24:44,343 --> 00:24:48,543
It seems like a small issue for you to be presenting the project in such an ambitious manner.

356
00:24:48,543 --> 00:24:49,933
To be blunt,

357
00:24:49,933 --> 00:24:54,203
I'm sure Young Toon has many more projects that are being dramatized.

358
00:24:55,193 --> 00:24:56,783
That's right.

359
00:24:56,783 --> 00:24:58,813
You have a good point there.

360
00:24:58,813 --> 00:25:04,993
If so, what could be why Young Toon has taken the first spot in the industry?

361
00:25:04,993 --> 00:25:07,963
First, they own many projects.

362
00:25:07,963 --> 00:25:11,003
Second, they have many talented artists.

363
00:25:11,003 --> 00:25:13,033
To be more precise,

364
00:25:13,033 --> 00:25:14,760
they have an artist named Mo Yeong Su,

365
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:18,240
who is able to produce numerous titles.

366
00:25:18,243 --> 00:25:23,563
However, must Neon acquire Young Toon in order to obtain that same system?

367
00:25:23,563 --> 00:25:27,203
Can't Neon develop a system like that ourselve?

368
00:25:32,843 --> 00:25:35,913
 Plan for establishing Studio Ginger  
 In Neon, we have Artist Na Gang Nam,

369
00:25:35,913 --> 00:25:38,793
a great cartoonist that even Young Toon has been coveting.

370
00:25:38,793 --> 00:25:43,213
Currently, Artist Na Gang Nam owns vast content besides the titles he's serializing on Neon.

371
00:25:43,213 --> 00:25:45,063
If Neon provides him with a system that

372
00:25:45,063 --> 00:25:49,223
could serialize his content simultaneously through an affiliate company,

373
00:25:49,223 --> 00:25:52,753
it's possible to create consistently high profit

374
00:25:52,753 --> 00:25:57,213
with less money than required to purchase Young Toon.

375
00:25:58,813 --> 00:26:00,823
But in order to establish a company like this,

376
00:26:00,823 --> 00:26:04,113
shouldn't we have a trustworthy person go there as a CEO?

377
00:26:04,113 --> 00:26:05,883
You're right.

378
00:26:05,883 --> 00:26:09,933
Artist Na Gang Nam isn't knowledgeable about management.

379
00:26:09,933 --> 00:26:11,153
That's right.

380
00:26:11,153 --> 00:26:13,113
Yes.

381
00:26:13,113 --> 00:26:14,853
That's why...

382
00:26:15,843 --> 00:26:19,323
I recommend the deputy editor of Neon Webtoon, Seok Ji Hyeong,

383
00:26:19,323 --> 00:26:23,633
as a co-CEO of Studio Ginger.

384
00:26:25,423 --> 00:26:27,183
Deputy Editor Seok Ji Hyeong?

385
00:26:27,183 --> 00:26:28,533
Yes.

386
00:26:28,533 --> 00:26:33,213
Artist Na Gang Nam will be the CEO for creative content. 
  Studio Ginger Organizational Structure 

387
00:26:33,213 --> 00:26:35,663
Deputy Editor Seok Ji Hyeong

388
00:26:35,663 --> 00:26:38,303
is an elite who has various experience working in

389
00:26:38,303 --> 00:26:41,143
print comics, GingerToon, and Neon Webtoon.

390
00:26:41,143 --> 00:26:46,013
He, especially, has worked a long time with Artist Na Gang Nam as the PD in charge.

391
00:26:46,013 --> 00:26:49,663
We anticipate that they have quite a trusting relationship.

392
00:26:53,483 --> 00:26:54,880
Last of all,

393
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:58,630
I have one request.

394
00:26:58,633 --> 00:27:02,943
Just because one plows the soil, plants seeds, and waters the wasteland,

395
00:27:02,943 --> 00:27:05,883
you wouldn't call someone foolish.

396
00:27:05,883 --> 00:27:10,743
Because he knows a big tree will grow and he'll be rewarded with its fruit in the end.

397
00:27:10,743 --> 00:27:15,943
I believe you wouldn't make the mistake now of

398
00:27:15,943 --> 00:27:19,793
chopping down a small tree that just started to blossom.

399
00:27:20,873 --> 00:27:22,643
That is all.

400
00:27:56,813 --> 00:27:59,063
D-Did you do well?

401
00:28:02,613 --> 00:28:04,553
The fact that you'll be the CEO and will leave us...

402
00:28:04,553 --> 00:28:07,333
Should I tell the others or do you want to tell them?

403
00:28:14,848 --> 00:28:16,093
Congrats.

404
00:28:16,093 --> 00:28:17,743
Let's go!

405
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:20,580
â€Ž

406
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:24,640
I wonder how happy they will be.

407
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:29,940
â™«  Even today when I'm tired, my day is shining.  â™«

408
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:32,523
I'm back. 
 â™«  Everyday is my birthdayt  â™«

409
00:28:32,523 --> 00:28:36,023
So, what's the result? 
 â™«  Everyday is my birthdayt  â™«

410
00:28:37,513 --> 00:28:39,983
We did it. 
 â™«  I am like an awkward child  â™«

411
00:28:39,983 --> 00:28:42,443
What? 
 â™«  The little whisper of wind    â™«   

412
00:28:42,443 --> 00:28:45,553
It went well.
 â™«  and the warmth of the blazing sun   â™«   

413
00:28:45,553 --> 00:28:48,723
The evaluation of our future business endeavors was good.

414
00:28:48,723 --> 00:28:51,143
We need to prove it with our performance, but

415
00:28:51,143 --> 00:28:53,870
no one will shake us up until we get some results.

416
00:28:53,870 --> 00:28:57,340
â™«   In the dark night when everyone is asleep,  â™«

417
00:28:57,340 --> 00:29:01,273
Oh, my God! 
 â™«   I'm the only one who forget to sleep  â™«

418
00:29:01,273 --> 00:29:03,363
I feel...

419
00:29:03,363 --> 00:29:06,473
I feel so bad and grateful at the same time, you know.

420
00:29:06,473 --> 00:29:09,353
Why are you saying that stuff? I'm going to cry.

421
00:29:09,353 --> 00:29:10,803
I really, really thank you.

422
00:29:10,803 --> 00:29:12,673
I'm just thankful.

423
00:29:12,673 --> 00:29:15,283
To each and every one of you here,

424
00:29:15,283 --> 00:29:19,483
we could never get this kind of result without you guys.

425
00:29:19,483 --> 00:29:23,523
Thank you... 
 â™«   A night dreaming dreams  â™«

426
00:29:23,523 --> 00:29:27,053
Shouldn't you say something like this as you give a toast at our team dinner?

427
00:29:27,053 --> 00:29:28,233
Team dinner sounds good.

428
00:29:28,233 --> 00:29:29,803
Another team dinner?

429
00:29:29,803 --> 00:29:32,123
- I'm not going.
 - Why not? This definitely calls for one.

430
00:29:32,123 --> 00:29:33,873
My soles hurt too much.

431
00:29:33,873 --> 00:29:36,116
Just don't take off your shoes. Your shoes.

432
00:29:36,116 --> 00:29:37,676
Me?

433
00:29:38,544 --> 00:29:41,123
Just drink moderately, and don't take off your shoes.

434
00:29:41,123 --> 00:29:43,223
Going shoeless is just the beginning.

435
00:29:43,223 --> 00:29:45,173
- Right, right, right.
 - So, you remember.

436
00:29:45,173 --> 00:29:47,273
- Of course, I do.
 - How do you remember that?

437
00:29:47,273 --> 00:29:49,043
Give me your attention for just a moment.

438
00:29:49,043 --> 00:29:51,013
I have an important announcement.

439
00:29:51,013 --> 00:29:53,103
What is it?

440
00:29:54,273 --> 00:29:55,783
Well...

441
00:29:56,423 --> 00:29:58,703
our Deputy Editor Seok Ji Hyeong

442
00:29:58,703 --> 00:30:02,643
has been appointed as the co-CEO of the new affiliate company Neon

443
00:30:02,643 --> 00:30:05,623
that we're developing with Artist Na Gang Nam.

444
00:30:05,623 --> 00:30:09,913
It means he'll be honorably leaving our Neon Webtoon.

445
00:30:11,313 --> 00:30:13,643
What in the world are you talking about all of a sudden?

446
00:30:13,643 --> 00:30:18,473
I wanted to tell you after the executives' meeting and after everything was decided.

447
00:30:18,473 --> 00:30:20,423
It's a shock to you all, huh?

448
00:30:24,113 --> 00:30:25,963
Tell them yourself.

449
00:30:32,673 --> 00:30:34,283
Well...

450
00:30:36,973 --> 00:30:41,563
ever since GingerToon days even before Neon Webtoon,

451
00:30:41,563 --> 00:30:45,143
we have all worked together,

452
00:30:45,143 --> 00:30:49,613
PD Kwon Yeong Bae, and PD Choi Du Hui,

453
00:30:49,613 --> 00:30:52,453
and PD Yu Mi.

454
00:30:53,323 --> 00:30:55,673
And our Hyeong Man Cheol.

455
00:30:56,743 --> 00:31:01,543
Wherever I may be and at any given point, I'll always cheer you on in my heart

456
00:31:01,543 --> 00:31:04,843
and I'll believe that we're all together.

457
00:31:05,743 --> 00:31:08,413
And our two newbie PDs.

458
00:31:08,413 --> 00:31:12,243
I was extremely concerned about you, but

459
00:31:12,243 --> 00:31:14,670
I have confirmed once again that you have the ability

460
00:31:14,670 --> 00:31:16,810
to ultimately take care of things on your own

461
00:31:16,813 --> 00:31:20,363
and what amazing PDs you are.

462
00:31:20,363 --> 00:31:22,553
So, I think I'll be able to

463
00:31:24,673 --> 00:31:27,663
leave you in peace.

464
00:31:27,663 --> 00:31:31,443
I'll cheer you on wherever I am.

465
00:31:31,443 --> 00:31:35,513
I think I'll feel like we're still working together.

466
00:31:35,513 --> 00:31:37,403
That's how I feel.

467
00:31:40,603 --> 00:31:44,763
This is a good thing. He's leaving because it's an opportunity for all of us to grow.

468
00:31:44,763 --> 00:31:48,203
And it's a company that'll continue to work with us.

469
00:31:48,203 --> 00:31:50,843
This time around, we can smile...

470
00:31:51,523 --> 00:31:53,733
Let's send him off with a smile.

471
00:31:54,783 --> 00:31:56,143
Gosh, I'm nervous.

472
00:31:56,143 --> 00:32:00,183
I mean, nothing's been decided. Why be nervous?

473
00:32:00,183 --> 00:32:01,543
In any case,

474
00:32:01,543 --> 00:32:03,973
- it's a good thing, right?
 - Sure.

475
00:32:03,973 --> 00:32:05,993
Let's congratulate him first.

476
00:32:05,993 --> 00:32:08,063
- Congratulations, CEO.
 - My gosh.

477
00:32:08,063 --> 00:32:09,373
Congratulations, CEO Seok!

478
00:32:09,373 --> 00:32:11,523
Gosh, thanks.

479
00:32:11,523 --> 00:32:14,363
Thank you for everything.

480
00:32:15,233 --> 00:32:17,293
Thanks to you, too.

481
00:32:19,503 --> 00:32:21,183
Your leaving is a good thing, butâ€”

482
00:32:21,183 --> 00:32:24,433
- I'll have to become the deputyâ€”
 - Toast.

483
00:32:24,433 --> 00:32:26,283
Okay, congratulations.

484
00:32:26,283 --> 00:32:27,813
Congratulations!

485
00:32:27,813 --> 00:32:30,423
Gosh, I feel so teary-eyed.

486
00:32:30,423 --> 00:32:32,723
I'm not comfortable being a deputy editor!

487
00:32:32,723 --> 00:32:34,587
Don't. Don't be uncomfortable.

488
00:32:34,587 --> 00:32:36,567
Then I'll do it.

489
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:48,753
â™«  Walking down a road which has no end in sight  â™«

490
00:32:48,753 --> 00:32:55,430
â™«  Today too my exhausted footstep leads me  â™«

491
00:32:56,123 --> 00:32:59,823
â™«  Don't cry, don't cry  â™«

492
00:32:59,823 --> 00:33:03,513
â™«  It's okay.  You'll be fine.  â™«

493
00:33:03,513 --> 00:33:07,603
â™«  If someone had told me  â™«

494
00:33:07,603 --> 00:33:11,200
â™«  I someone would hug me  â™«

495
00:33:12,313 --> 00:33:14,683
â™«  I would have liked that  â™«

496
00:33:14,683 --> 00:33:16,193
 Thank you 

497
00:33:16,193 --> 00:33:17,753
 for letting me find out that I was wrong.
 

498
00:33:17,753 --> 00:33:25,003
â™«  like my mom, no matter what be on my side  â™«

499
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:27,933
 Going forward, 

500
00:33:27,933 --> 00:33:32,000
 you'll continue to do a good job, right? 

501
00:33:32,993 --> 00:33:35,833
â™«   Take a break when you're tired.  â™«

502
00:33:35,833 --> 00:33:39,160
â™«  because there still is a lot of time  â™«

503
00:33:40,143 --> 00:33:42,900
â™«  I'm lost  â™«

504
00:33:43,783 --> 00:33:47,743
â™«  I wonder if I'm doing well  â™«

505
00:33:47,743 --> 00:33:53,310
â™«  I think we may have gone too far  â™«

506
00:33:53,310 --> 00:33:55,692
 Do you like heads or tails? 

507
00:33:55,692 --> 00:33:58,795
 Oh, all of a sudden? 

508
00:33:58,795 --> 00:34:03,218
 I'll go with heads. 

509
00:34:03,218 --> 00:34:06,783
â™«  If someone had told me so  â™«

510
00:34:06,783 --> 00:34:10,223
â™«  If someone would hug me  â™«

511
00:34:12,084 --> 00:34:16,214
 Good luck on your interview, On Ma Eum. 

512
00:34:16,214 --> 00:34:18,143
â™«  Like my mom  â™«

513
00:34:18,143 --> 00:34:21,458
 I'll take this back. It was mine, to begin with.
 

514
00:34:21,458 --> 00:34:23,013
 What? 

515
00:34:23,013 --> 00:34:26,523
 That good luck is always on our side. 

516
00:34:26,523 --> 00:34:30,730
â™«  Don't try too hard  â™«

517
00:34:32,043 --> 00:34:34,693
â™«  Take a break when you're tired  â™«

518
00:34:34,693 --> 00:34:38,290
â™«  Because there still is a lot of time  â™«

519
00:34:40,383 --> 00:34:47,703
â™«  Even if you stay up all night however cold the long night ist  â™«

520
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:57,200
â™«  Don't be lonely.  I will be with you.  You and I.  â™«

521
00:34:59,393 --> 00:35:04,093
â™«  It will be fine if we do that.  â™«

522
00:35:04,093 --> 00:35:07,663
â™«  You will become mine  â™«

523
00:35:07,663 --> 00:35:12,220
â™«  I will become yours  â™«

524
00:35:14,533 --> 00:35:18,620
â™«  Let's lean on each other  â™«

525
00:35:20,143 --> 00:35:27,583
â™«   no matter where we are we won't fall.  â™«

526
00:35:27,583 --> 00:35:31,083
How soft.

527
00:35:31,083 --> 00:35:34,310
â™«  When it's hard lets say be strong.  â™«

528
00:35:35,823 --> 00:35:39,853
 Neon: Gu Jun Yeong, Webtoon Service 

529
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:50,400
 As Ma Eum said we would, our team survived. 

530
00:35:57,456 --> 00:36:00,741
Having a ball, huh, Webtoon Team?

531
00:36:00,741 --> 00:36:03,266
Yes, we're extremely excited.

532
00:36:06,065 --> 00:36:07,533
Settle down.

533
00:36:07,533 --> 00:36:08,963
You know this since you were in judo.

534
00:36:08,963 --> 00:36:13,433
At times, you need a referee's decision after the match is over.

535
00:36:13,433 --> 00:36:17,833
I believe our team won by one full point.

536
00:36:17,833 --> 00:36:19,363
Sure, fine.

537
00:36:19,363 --> 00:36:22,333
- Let's wait and see.
 - We'll get going then.

538
00:36:26,519 --> 00:36:29,249
Even a contractor looks down on me.

539
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:53,673
I'm sorry, but that's why we'll have to switch the PD in charge for you.

540
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:57,553
I don't think you need to do that.

541
00:36:57,553 --> 00:36:59,293
What do you mean?

542
00:36:59,293 --> 00:37:03,203
I'd like to suspend the series temporarily.

543
00:37:03,203 --> 00:37:05,783
Oh, sir, if you were offended byâ€”

544
00:37:05,783 --> 00:37:07,633
No, I'm not.

545
00:37:09,142 --> 00:37:14,485
My back pain has become unbearable now.

546
00:37:15,468 --> 00:37:17,940
If I were to let it persist,

547
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:20,970
I'm sure I'd endure it somehow.

548
00:37:20,975 --> 00:37:24,020
But for me to complete my work properly,

549
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:27,750
I think surgery is necessary.

550
00:37:28,525 --> 00:37:34,278
Until my original manager in charge, PD Jung returns,

551
00:37:35,005 --> 00:37:37,265
I'll recover, and

552
00:37:38,535 --> 00:37:45,895
I plan to work on not losing my feel for the work.

553
00:37:45,895 --> 00:37:49,265
It must've not been an easy decision for you.

554
00:37:49,265 --> 00:37:51,665
I just feel bad.

555
00:37:51,665 --> 00:37:54,125
Because at such a crucial timing,

556
00:37:54,125 --> 00:37:57,065
I'll have to suspend my series.

557
00:37:57,065 --> 00:37:58,775
Gosh, no, sir.

558
00:37:58,775 --> 00:38:01,035
Your health takes priority over anything else.

559
00:38:01,035 --> 00:38:03,735
But since there are some saved manuscripts,

560
00:38:03,735 --> 00:38:07,045
the inactive period for the series will be shorter than expected.

561
00:38:07,045 --> 00:38:10,565
Please don't worry about any of that.

562
00:38:10,565 --> 00:38:13,875
Just think about your health, sir.

563
00:38:14,693 --> 00:38:19,428
Get plenty of rest and come back healthy.

564
00:38:20,499 --> 00:38:24,045
You didn't forget the promise you made with us, right?

565
00:38:24,045 --> 00:38:25,705
Your dragon series...

566
00:38:25,705 --> 00:38:28,795
We said we'd wrap it up nicely together.

567
00:38:28,795 --> 00:38:30,255
That's right.

568
00:38:30,255 --> 00:38:32,275
We did say that.

569
00:38:32,275 --> 00:38:38,155
You said that you'll put proper finishing touches on my cartoonist career.

570
00:38:38,155 --> 00:38:41,365
That you'd take care of it no matter what.

571
00:38:45,075 --> 00:38:47,035
Thank you.

572
00:38:49,424 --> 00:38:51,864
The smell? It doesn't smell, though...

573
00:38:51,864 --> 00:38:53,024
It does.

574
00:38:53,024 --> 00:38:55,134
How about this...

575
00:38:55,134 --> 00:38:56,224
Oh, okay...

576
00:38:56,224 --> 00:38:57,964
- I think th-this will be good.
 - No!

577
00:38:57,964 --> 00:39:00,214
Gosh, I can't eat it.

578
00:39:00,994 --> 00:39:02,054
Put it down. I don't want to eat it.

579
00:39:02,054 --> 00:39:06,244
- But still, you need to eat.
 - I won't eat. I can't eat anything!

580
00:39:06,244 --> 00:39:09,344
Oh, it must be Mandu.

581
00:39:15,544 --> 00:39:17,584
Ta-da!

582
00:39:17,584 --> 00:39:18,664
I'm here!

583
00:39:18,664 --> 00:39:21,574
Along with tteokbokki Ms. Han Seul likes.

584
00:39:21,574 --> 00:39:23,004
Tteokbokki?

585
00:39:23,004 --> 00:39:25,394
You can't eat tteokbokki...

586
00:39:25,394 --> 00:39:28,794
- Wow!
 - Her morning sickness is bad.

587
00:39:30,654 --> 00:39:32,044
You said you couldn't eat anything I gave you.

588
00:39:32,044 --> 00:39:33,894
I guess I wanted to see Mandu the most.

589
00:39:33,894 --> 00:39:37,664
Now that I see Mandu, the morning sickness has totally vanished.

590
00:39:40,584 --> 00:39:43,494
Artist Na, I'm sad.

591
00:39:43,494 --> 00:39:46,154
I heard you'll get to work with our deputy editor.

592
00:39:46,154 --> 00:39:48,694
How can you take away our deputy editor like that?

593
00:39:48,694 --> 00:39:49,834
Take away?

594
00:39:49,834 --> 00:39:53,434
They said they'll make sure my work will see the light of day and are tying me down.

595
00:39:53,434 --> 00:39:56,484
Then they should find someone to raise   my baby   (his work), too.

596
00:39:56,484 --> 00:39:57,754
Raise my baby?

597
00:39:57,754 --> 00:40:00,344
- Who's raising our baby?
 - No.

598
00:40:00,344 --> 00:40:02,334
I'll raise our kid.

599
00:40:02,334 --> 00:40:04,294
Eat now.

600
00:40:05,824 --> 00:40:09,854
How he's going to sell it is completely the PD's job.

601
00:40:09,854 --> 00:40:11,094
I have faith.

602
00:40:11,094 --> 00:40:16,124
If it's an editor like PD Seok, I'm sure he'll produce my webtoon in a fantastic way.

603
00:40:16,124 --> 00:40:19,904
You two are always such a fantastic duo.

604
00:40:19,904 --> 00:40:22,084
- What?
 - I mean...

605
00:40:22,084 --> 00:40:26,684
Deputy Editor said that it's entirely up to the artist to go from "zero" to "one."

606
00:40:26,684 --> 00:40:28,844
That there's nothing an editor could do for the artist.

607
00:40:28,844 --> 00:40:32,770
But you also said that turning that "one" into a bigger number

608
00:40:32,770 --> 00:40:36,260
is entirely up to the editor.

609
00:40:37,094 --> 00:40:39,264
It's like being a mom.

610
00:40:40,344 --> 00:40:43,424
Then is Deputy Editor Seok Ji Hyeong your mom?

611
00:40:43,424 --> 00:40:45,214
What now?

612
00:40:45,214 --> 00:40:48,054
You said you two made "Gumiho Princess" together from the very beginning.

613
00:40:48,054 --> 00:40:50,514
That's right! Y-You're... you're right, but...

614
00:40:50,514 --> 00:40:53,444
why? Why is something so gross?

615
00:40:53,444 --> 00:40:56,434
Whoa, that sounds weird to me, too.

616
00:41:05,994 --> 00:41:07,674
I'm late, huh? I'm sorry.

617
00:41:07,674 --> 00:41:09,814
I just got here, too.

618
00:41:09,814 --> 00:41:11,824
It was tough coming here after meeting your deadline, right?

619
00:41:11,824 --> 00:41:15,274
You had it harder, coming after your work.

620
00:41:16,004 --> 00:41:18,224
How are things at Neon these days?

621
00:41:18,224 --> 00:41:21,804
The atmosphere seems to have gotten better again.

622
00:41:21,804 --> 00:41:25,304
The winning prize for the upcoming contest is hefty, too.

623
00:41:27,614 --> 00:41:31,344
Don't you still think about webtoons?

624
00:41:38,784 --> 00:41:43,854
 Files and recordings 

625
00:41:56,914 --> 00:41:59,384
This isn't going to work for me, Director.

626
00:41:59,384 --> 00:42:01,624
Didn't you clearly say that it would be possible for us to

627
00:42:01,624 --> 00:42:04,874
take over the department at the cost you had promised?

628
00:42:04,874 --> 00:42:08,954
They're like weeds. I'm so sick and tired of them.

629
00:42:08,954 --> 00:42:13,584
The business ventures and investments I started, trusting what you said, cost a lot of money.

630
00:42:13,584 --> 00:42:16,214
I can't sort this out!

631
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:20,900
- CEO, Kimâ€”
 - I will not go down alone.

632
00:42:20,974 --> 00:42:24,574
If the fact that you own our shares under a borrowed name is revealed,

633
00:42:24,574 --> 00:42:26,974
what do you think will happen?

634
00:42:29,014 --> 00:42:33,704
Whatever it takes, keep your promise.

635
00:42:43,864 --> 00:42:45,924
I'm tired...

636
00:42:59,724 --> 00:43:02,174
I don't have much to give you, but...

637
00:43:02,174 --> 00:43:06,214
What, what, what's this? You made my heart drop.

638
00:43:11,724 --> 00:43:12,824
I feel better now.

639
00:43:12,824 --> 00:43:15,444
I ran out of coffee anyway.

640
00:43:15,444 --> 00:43:18,804
So I was wondering if I should go out and get some.

641
00:43:20,694 --> 00:43:22,664
Feels much better.

642
00:43:23,444 --> 00:43:25,874
Anyway, aren't you going home?

643
00:43:25,874 --> 00:43:27,744
Even if I went home,

644
00:43:27,744 --> 00:43:30,884
I'd be checking out the works submitted for the contest.

645
00:43:31,874 --> 00:43:33,014
Why?

646
00:43:33,014 --> 00:43:34,964
Do I seem like I have no life?

647
00:43:34,964 --> 00:43:36,424
No, that's not it.

648
00:43:36,424 --> 00:43:37,794
I feel bad.

649
00:43:37,794 --> 00:43:39,994
The contest is not a small project.

650
00:43:39,994 --> 00:43:43,344
I wonder if I just put everything on your plate.

651
00:43:43,344 --> 00:43:45,074
This isn't the first time.

652
00:43:45,074 --> 00:43:47,524
I've done this ever since our GingerToon days.

653
00:43:47,524 --> 00:43:49,794
I feel even worse now.

654
00:43:52,784 --> 00:43:53,914
Is it hard?

655
00:43:53,914 --> 00:43:56,224
Of course, it's hard.

656
00:43:56,224 --> 00:44:00,534
I also want to have a hobby, hang out with my friends, too.

657
00:44:00,534 --> 00:44:04,014
Then why didn't you assert yourself more strongly?

658
00:44:04,014 --> 00:44:05,574
Go on a long vacation, too.

659
00:44:05,574 --> 00:44:07,444
Vacation?

660
00:44:07,444 --> 00:44:10,664
Do you know what I do on vacation?

661
00:44:11,684 --> 00:44:14,004
You must read webtoons!

662
00:44:14,004 --> 00:44:15,234
Yes.

663
00:44:15,234 --> 00:44:18,240
Even if I travel to a nice spot, I seek out a nice cafe and find myself reading webtoons.

664
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:20,760
and find myself reading webtoons.

665
00:44:20,764 --> 00:44:23,094
My gosh. You do the same thing I do.

666
00:44:23,094 --> 00:44:27,344
Makes me wonder why I choose to work like a dog when no one even acknowledges it.

667
00:44:27,344 --> 00:44:30,454
But when I see the work published, it feels like it was worth it.

668
00:44:30,454 --> 00:44:34,864
I think I still like this job a lot.

669
00:44:38,494 --> 00:44:40,604
We overcame our last hurdle nicely.

670
00:44:40,604 --> 00:44:43,654
So take a long vacation this time.

671
00:44:43,654 --> 00:44:47,484
Even if you read the webtoons, it's much nicer if you read them in a nice resort.

672
00:44:47,484 --> 00:44:49,484
Then send me away.

673
00:44:49,484 --> 00:44:51,544
Got it. Really, take a long vacation this time.

674
00:44:51,544 --> 00:44:52,814
All right.

675
00:44:52,814 --> 00:44:55,994
Oh, how is Artist Baek Eo Jin doing?

676
00:44:55,994 --> 00:44:59,064
He's getting a new PD in charge again.

677
00:45:02,784 --> 00:45:05,934
Artist Baek Eo Jin? A surgery?

678
00:45:05,934 --> 00:45:07,900
In his current condition,

679
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:11,050
I think he determined that it would be too much to show good work.

680
00:45:11,054 --> 00:45:13,044
That surgery must be pretty intense.

681
00:45:13,044 --> 00:45:14,974
I know.

682
00:45:14,974 --> 00:45:19,164
Since he took a big step and set his mind to it, we should respect his decision.

683
00:45:19,164 --> 00:45:22,534
In the end, he chose to do so for the sake of his work.

684
00:45:22,534 --> 00:45:24,964
His master mindset is on another level.

685
00:45:24,964 --> 00:45:27,080
He's amazing. Really.

686
00:45:27,994 --> 00:45:29,624
How is the contest going, PD Gi?

687
00:45:29,624 --> 00:45:32,294
We just have to select works for the finals.

688
00:45:32,294 --> 00:45:36,014
Those of you who haven't sent me your recommendations, please do so.

689
00:45:36,014 --> 00:45:38,254
- I made my selection.
 - What is it?

690
00:45:38,254 --> 00:45:40,014
"Travel Trouble."

691
00:45:40,014 --> 00:45:42,834
As for that one, I want to take on that project even if it doesn't win.

692
00:45:42,834 --> 00:45:46,064
It left such a strong impression on me.

693
00:45:46,064 --> 00:45:49,414
Didn't you pick that one, PD Kwon?

694
00:45:49,414 --> 00:45:53,914
He called first dibs on that one and said he wants to be in charge and serialize it.

695
00:45:53,914 --> 00:45:56,514
You two apparently are in sync.

696
00:45:56,514 --> 00:45:58,194
You guys were like this with Artist Gu Seul Ah, too.

697
00:45:58,194 --> 00:45:59,494
Wow, daebak.

698
00:45:59,494 --> 00:46:02,264
That daebak? That could happen.

699
00:46:02,264 --> 00:46:04,624
Then please take care of the contest, PD Gi.

700
00:46:04,624 --> 00:46:07,224
Does anyone have any other agenda items for discussion?

701
00:46:07,224 --> 00:46:09,104
No, right? Meeting adjourned.

702
00:46:09,104 --> 00:46:10,184
- On Ma Eum. 
- Yes?

703
00:46:10,184 --> 00:46:11,864
Talk to me before you go.

704
00:46:11,864 --> 00:46:12,764
Yes, sir.

705
00:46:12,764 --> 00:46:14,674
Thank you.

706
00:46:19,664 --> 00:46:22,114
Wow, daebak!

707
00:46:25,924 --> 00:46:29,504
How many years did you do judo, On Ma Eum?

708
00:46:29,504 --> 00:46:32,124
I did it for 15 years.

709
00:46:32,124 --> 00:46:37,414
Then let's work with me at Neon for exactly 15 years.

710
00:46:41,084 --> 00:46:43,874
What you're saying is...

711
00:46:43,874 --> 00:46:46,874
We're able to hire you full time.

712
00:46:49,164 --> 00:46:50,354
But how?

713
00:46:50,354 --> 00:46:54,004
It's all because you worked so hard, On Ma Eum.

714
00:46:54,004 --> 00:46:56,824
I mean, if they don't hire an employee who works so hard and is so passionate,

715
00:46:56,824 --> 00:46:58,514
it'd be a big loss for Neon.

716
00:46:58,514 --> 00:47:00,154
Congratulations.

717
00:47:00,154 --> 00:47:02,134
Enjoy the moment alone for a bit, then come out.

718
00:47:02,134 --> 00:47:04,014
Okay.

719
00:47:04,014 --> 00:47:06,324
Gosh, I love it.

720
00:47:31,494 --> 00:47:34,484
How long have you been standing here?

721
00:47:36,074 --> 00:47:38,014
Congratulations.

722
00:47:38,014 --> 00:47:40,454
â™«  Congratulations  â™«

723
00:47:40,454 --> 00:47:42,554
â™«  Congratulations  â™«

724
00:47:42,554 --> 00:47:47,274
â™«  Congratulations on Ma Eum's full time employment  â™«

725
00:47:47,274 --> 00:47:49,764
PD On, congratulations on your full-time position.

726
00:47:49,764 --> 00:47:51,464
Wow, congratulations!

727
00:47:51,464 --> 00:47:53,774
Our team has double the celebration.

728
00:47:53,774 --> 00:47:55,264
Gosh, scared me.

729
00:47:55,264 --> 00:47:57,174
I told you I didn't want to do this.

730
00:47:57,734 --> 00:47:59,474
Good work, well, you know...

731
00:47:59,474 --> 00:48:02,854
We have similar tastes. Let's fight fiercely going forward.

732
00:48:02,854 --> 00:48:05,364
Sincere congratulations, Ma Eum.

733
00:48:05,364 --> 00:48:08,744
Oh, my, my, my... Who made you cry...

734
00:48:08,744 --> 00:48:11,584
Who did this? Aigoo, you deserve it.

735
00:48:11,584 --> 00:48:14,604
I'll work hard!

736
00:48:15,954 --> 00:48:17,904
Congrats!

737
00:48:23,544 --> 00:48:25,514
Okay, okay.

738
00:48:25,514 --> 00:48:28,314
Full time job! Let's go!

739
00:49:04,644 --> 00:49:10,430
 You did not pass the final interview for new hires at Neon 2022 

740
00:49:29,124 --> 00:49:33,094
 Neon, On Ma Eum, Webtoon Service 

741
00:49:44,804 --> 00:49:46,864
No one's home.

742
00:49:46,864 --> 00:49:49,244
I'm home!

743
00:49:49,244 --> 00:49:53,354
Ma Eum! Congratulations!

744
00:49:53,354 --> 00:49:56,194
You did it! Congratulations!

745
00:49:56,194 --> 00:49:58,914
- Here, here, here!
- Blow it out!

746
00:49:58,914 --> 00:50:00,934
â™«  Congratulations  â™«

747
00:50:00,934 --> 00:50:04,694
â™«  Congratulations  â™«

748
00:50:04,694 --> 00:50:08,134
â™«  Congratulations  â™«

749
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:15,650
- On Ma. 
- On Ma!

750
00:50:15,650 --> 00:50:18,820
 On Ma Eum! 

751
00:50:18,820 --> 00:50:21,350
On Ma Eum!

752
00:50:23,684 --> 00:50:27,084
It's fun to plan out new projects together.

753
00:50:27,754 --> 00:50:30,444
Gosh, but I'm sad.

754
00:50:31,804 --> 00:50:33,034
About what?

755
00:50:33,034 --> 00:50:35,584
I shouldn't have followed my feeling so much on "Origin of Mankind"

756
00:50:35,584 --> 00:50:38,884
but should have met with you a lot, like this.

757
00:50:38,884 --> 00:50:41,604
Yeah, but it was a bit too, you know...

758
00:50:42,834 --> 00:50:44,854
My heart aches whenever I think about "Origin of Mankind."

759
00:50:44,854 --> 00:50:48,544
But I think you were right in ending it early, PD Choi.

760
00:50:48,544 --> 00:50:50,614
I got hurt so much from the vicious comments.

761
00:50:50,614 --> 00:50:54,404
I was pretty much in a coma even after it ended.

762
00:50:54,404 --> 00:50:57,114
Especially that Webtoon Witch.

763
00:50:57,114 --> 00:50:59,094
You all watched Webtoon Witch, right?

764
00:50:59,094 --> 00:51:01,064
- Yes.
 - I know!

765
00:51:01,064 --> 00:51:03,724
I was at a point where I couldn't even work because I got so furious.

766
00:51:03,724 --> 00:51:06,394
How could she read vicious comments in a series of clips?

767
00:51:06,394 --> 00:51:09,114
Is she a webtoon artist or something? How dare she do a series?

768
00:51:09,114 --> 00:51:11,534
When I read that the reason for reading "Origin of Mankind"

769
00:51:11,534 --> 00:51:15,844
was so they could enjoy Webtoon Witch's review...

770
00:51:15,844 --> 00:51:19,064
Gosh, seriously. It was traumatic.

771
00:51:22,174 --> 00:51:23,954
- PD On, are you bored?
 - Are you bored?

772
00:51:23,954 --> 00:51:25,884
Bored?

773
00:51:26,784 --> 00:51:29,074
That Webtoon Witch. Really.

774
00:51:29,074 --> 00:51:31,484
- You seem uncomfortable. 
- Uncomfortable.

775
00:51:31,484 --> 00:51:33,804
Uncomfortable? No, why_

776
00:51:33,804 --> 00:51:36,524
Gosh! I'll hit you, hit you. Seriously!

777
00:51:36,524 --> 00:51:38,584
I'll spank you.

778
00:51:40,074 --> 00:51:42,214
Should we go out and talk more?

779
00:51:42,214 --> 00:51:45,344
It was fun to have an idea meeting at a comic book cafe.

780
00:51:45,344 --> 00:51:47,594
Right. When we needed inspiration, we used to read comic books.

781
00:51:47,594 --> 00:51:48,774
Oh, yeah!

782
00:51:48,774 --> 00:51:50,814
You said your family runs a comic book cafe.

783
00:51:50,814 --> 00:51:52,464
Should we go there today?

784
00:51:52,464 --> 00:51:56,064
We can get inspired as well as freshen up.

785
00:51:56,064 --> 00:52:00,154
Aigoo, how did you even find out about that?

786
00:52:00,154 --> 00:52:03,664
Well, but... now is... um...

787
00:52:03,664 --> 00:52:05,294
Why?

788
00:52:06,494 --> 00:52:08,474
Oh, your parents don't like me, huh?

789
00:52:08,474 --> 00:52:11,904
No, no, no, no! My family really, really love you.

790
00:52:11,904 --> 00:52:15,134
But well, right now is a bit...

791
00:52:15,134 --> 00:52:17,584
Yeah, um... right now?

792
00:52:24,524 --> 00:52:25,774
Five boxes.

793
00:52:25,774 --> 00:52:29,214
- I'm home. 
- Welcome.

794
00:52:34,744 --> 00:52:36,614
Hello.

795
00:52:38,124 --> 00:52:40,454
Honey, come here.

796
00:52:40,454 --> 00:52:42,724
I'm not dreaming, am I?

797
00:52:42,724 --> 00:52:44,594
Gosh, it's not a dream. Sorry.

798
00:52:44,594 --> 00:52:46,714
Oh, my! Artist Oh Yun!

799
00:52:46,714 --> 00:52:48,134
Oh, my goodness!

800
00:52:48,134 --> 00:52:50,344
I'm a huge fan!

801
00:52:50,344 --> 00:52:51,434
Hey, what's going on?

802
00:52:51,434 --> 00:52:53,574
I heard PD On's family runs a comic book cafe,

803
00:52:53,574 --> 00:52:54,814
so I asked her to invite me.

804
00:52:54,814 --> 00:52:58,154
I love comic book cafes, too.

805
00:52:58,154 --> 00:52:59,264
Hello.

806
00:52:59,264 --> 00:53:01,034
- Hi!
 - Hello...

807
00:53:01,034 --> 00:53:03,694
I work with PD On Ma Eum. I'm PD Choi Du Hui.

808
00:53:03,694 --> 00:53:06,094
Hello, working hard, huh? Nice to meet you.

809
00:53:06,094 --> 00:53:10,284
Artist Oh, may I ask you for your autograph?

810
00:53:10,284 --> 00:53:11,834
Yes. Of course.

811
00:53:11,834 --> 00:53:15,134
Honey, the limited-edition of "Ghost Kitchen" is on the living room table.

812
00:53:15,134 --> 00:53:18,254
Bring me that, paper, and pen, please.

813
00:53:18,254 --> 00:53:21,934
Well, I'm... Ma Eum's dad.

814
00:53:21,934 --> 00:53:23,694
Please have a seat.

815
00:53:23,694 --> 00:53:26,584
Yes, have a seat.

816
00:53:26,584 --> 00:53:29,024
Where is Nu Ri?

817
00:53:29,024 --> 00:53:30,674
Hey, Nu Ri!

818
00:53:30,674 --> 00:53:33,814
Why is Dad going up so hurriedly?

819
00:53:38,554 --> 00:53:41,694
This is for real. S-So cover your mouth.

820
00:53:44,184 --> 00:53:46,454
Are you PD Ma Eum's younger sister?

821
00:53:46,454 --> 00:53:48,834
Yes. All right then...

822
00:53:48,834 --> 00:53:51,194
- Goodbye.
 - Nu Ri!

823
00:53:51,194 --> 00:53:52,464
Come here and say hello with me.

824
00:53:52,464 --> 00:53:54,124
Artist Oh says he'll give us an autograph.

825
00:53:54,124 --> 00:53:56,644
You read his webtoon every day.

826
00:53:56,644 --> 00:53:58,964
- No, I don't!
 - What do you mean, no?

827
00:53:58,964 --> 00:54:02,614
My younger daughter is a huge fan of webtoons, too.

828
00:54:02,614 --> 00:54:06,094
She reads your webtoon every day, and what was it again? "Origin of Mankind."

829
00:54:06,094 --> 00:54:09,594
She read that over and over and over again...

830
00:54:09,594 --> 00:54:11,524
I'm touched. Really.

831
00:54:11,524 --> 00:54:13,414
- How grateful, huh?
 - I know.

832
00:54:13,414 --> 00:54:16,724
I'm the PD in charge of that webtoon.

833
00:54:16,724 --> 00:54:19,144
Even the PD came by today.

834
00:54:19,144 --> 00:54:21,964
But you two must be so exhausted.

835
00:54:21,964 --> 00:54:23,914
Yes, you look so tired.

836
00:54:23,914 --> 00:54:24,964
Not at all.

837
00:54:24,964 --> 00:54:26,974
I feel like I'm getting energized not that I'm here.

838
00:54:26,974 --> 00:54:29,944
No, no. She's asking for your autograph, and the people recognize you and all.

839
00:54:29,944 --> 00:54:31,154
Then...

840
00:54:31,154 --> 00:54:33,504
Then you'll feel drained soon.

841
00:54:33,504 --> 00:54:35,274
Yes, drained.

842
00:54:35,274 --> 00:54:37,584
I love doing things like that.

843
00:54:37,584 --> 00:54:39,464
So cool!

844
00:54:39,464 --> 00:54:41,164
Just read your comic books.

845
00:54:41,164 --> 00:54:46,254
Hey, that's right. It'd be nice to interact with his fans.

846
00:54:46,254 --> 00:54:50,084
The customers who came today, it's your lucky day.

847
00:54:50,084 --> 00:54:52,844
So, why don't we do an autograph session right here?

848
00:54:52,844 --> 00:54:55,324
Why would we do an autograph session now?

849
00:54:55,324 --> 00:54:58,044
There are quite a lot of crazy fans.

850
00:54:58,044 --> 00:54:59,884
Yes, it's dangerous here.

851
00:54:59,884 --> 00:55:01,504
This place is dangerous.

852
00:55:01,504 --> 00:55:03,444
I guess that could be. Shall we go now?

853
00:55:03,444 --> 00:55:05,564
- Oh, my.
 - We can just talk about work andâ€”

854
00:55:05,564 --> 00:55:07,544
- We should talk about work...
- I'll take them back.

855
00:55:07,544 --> 00:55:11,134
 - Why rush out?
 - I'll be back. 

856
00:55:12,504 --> 00:55:14,624
Gosh, this isn't it. Oh, my!

857
00:55:14,624 --> 00:55:15,814
Gosh, what to do...

858
00:55:15,814 --> 00:55:17,484
I found it. Ghost...

859
00:55:17,484 --> 00:55:19,924
They all left!

860
00:55:19,924 --> 00:55:22,384
Aren't you crazy?

861
00:55:24,394 --> 00:55:26,064
- Hey, On Nu Ri.
 - What?

862
00:55:26,064 --> 00:55:27,944
Look what happened. It's all your fault!

863
00:55:27,944 --> 00:55:30,234
You led them out, too. Why blame it on me?

864
00:55:30,234 --> 00:55:33,724
So, why did you have to cause the reason I had to lead him out?

865
00:55:33,724 --> 00:55:35,494
You trashed Artist Oh Yun's work so much.

866
00:55:35,494 --> 00:55:37,714
What if he recognized you as Webtoon Witch? He would've freaked out.

867
00:55:37,714 --> 00:55:39,774
Webtoon Witch?

868
00:55:41,454 --> 00:55:44,594
Were you there all along?

869
00:55:44,594 --> 00:55:46,634
Webtoon Witch, that person...

870
00:55:46,634 --> 00:55:49,104
She was trashing the webtoon that Ma Eum created.

871
00:55:49,104 --> 00:55:51,694
That was you, Nu Ri?

872
00:55:51,694 --> 00:55:53,764
What's Webtoon Witch?

873
00:55:53,764 --> 00:55:55,664
Nu Ri, did you trash talk your eonni?

874
00:55:55,664 --> 00:55:58,054
Gosh, what do you mean trash talk?

875
00:55:58,054 --> 00:56:00,404
Critique. Use a high-quality word.

876
00:56:00,404 --> 00:56:02,654
Then you should've told your sister in advance.

877
00:56:02,654 --> 00:56:05,034
You knew she was upset about it.

878
00:56:06,004 --> 00:56:07,654
I started it first,

879
00:56:07,654 --> 00:56:10,644
even before Eonni became a webtoon PD.

880
00:56:11,614 --> 00:56:14,814
I'm sorry that I couldn't tell you because I missed my timing.

881
00:56:14,814 --> 00:56:17,864
But I didn't mean to do this, either.

882
00:56:17,864 --> 00:56:20,444
You always say it's all my fault, Mom.

883
00:56:21,380 --> 00:56:22,824
What's with her?

884
00:56:22,824 --> 00:56:24,864
What happened?

885
00:56:24,864 --> 00:56:26,664
It's nothing.

886
00:56:26,664 --> 00:56:29,314
So, what is it?

887
00:56:29,314 --> 00:56:31,684
I wasn't trying to do this.

888
00:56:54,053 --> 00:56:57,903
I didn't want to tell Mom and Dad like that.

889
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:01,687
Sorry.

890
00:57:01,687 --> 00:57:03,537
It's okay.

891
00:57:07,953 --> 00:57:14,633
Recently, I heard that my job is like being a shadow-artist.

892
00:57:14,633 --> 00:57:17,103
I identified with it.

893
00:57:17,103 --> 00:57:22,543
Webtoon PDs really stay by the webtoon artists quietly like their shadows.

894
00:57:22,543 --> 00:57:26,713
And people often don't know of our existence, like shadows.

895
00:57:28,714 --> 00:57:31,774
It's not like you wanted it to happen, but

896
00:57:31,774 --> 00:57:34,510
I wonder how you must've felt being

897
00:57:34,510 --> 00:57:38,200
someone else's shadow as a young child.

898
00:57:39,593 --> 00:57:43,883
Because I was in judo ever since our childhood, Mom and Dad took care of only me.

899
00:57:43,883 --> 00:57:47,923
That was upsetting and sad for you, right?

900
00:57:51,133 --> 00:57:54,153
You'd be so cool if you received the spotlight.

901
00:57:54,153 --> 00:57:56,863
Honestly, that Webtoon Witch...

902
00:57:56,863 --> 00:57:59,103
Gosh, I get so pissed, but

903
00:57:59,103 --> 00:58:02,293
I watched it to the end because it was so fun. How annoying.

904
00:58:03,883 --> 00:58:06,903
- Really?
 - Yeah, really.

905
00:58:08,323 --> 00:58:11,383
While assisting artists these days,

906
00:58:11,383 --> 00:58:13,173
I'm reminded of times

907
00:58:13,173 --> 00:58:18,503
when my family sacrificed so much when I used to do judo.

908
00:58:20,043 --> 00:58:24,493
From now on, I'll give you some information

909
00:58:24,493 --> 00:58:29,973
in the webtoon world and help Webtoon Witch.

910
00:58:34,673 --> 00:58:35,950
And,

911
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:41,270
I know you started it first.

912
00:58:42,398 --> 00:58:45,868
You got me started in the webtoon world, too.

913
00:58:48,008 --> 00:58:52,938
When I got injured, you're the one who recommended "Gumiho Princess."

914
00:58:53,828 --> 00:58:57,078
I started liking webtoons because of that one.

915
00:58:57,898 --> 00:59:02,908
On one hand, it's thanks to you that I became a webtoon PD.

916
00:59:07,488 --> 00:59:11,318
Thank you so much for letting me find something I love

917
00:59:12,088 --> 00:59:15,678
as much as I love judo. I mean it.

918
00:59:16,738 --> 00:59:19,228
I couldn't hear you well.

919
00:59:19,228 --> 00:59:21,048
What did you say?

920
00:59:22,958 --> 00:59:24,538
Thanks.

921
00:59:24,538 --> 00:59:26,168
I mean it.

922
00:59:26,168 --> 00:59:27,208
Happy now?

923
00:59:27,208 --> 00:59:28,888
Got it!

924
00:59:28,888 --> 00:59:31,768
- Happy now?
 - Yup!

925
00:59:32,498 --> 00:59:35,798
Artist Baek's surgery is tomorrow.

926
00:59:35,798 --> 00:59:37,198
Yeah.

927
00:59:37,198 --> 00:59:40,488
It'll take several months for him to recover from his surgery.

928
00:59:40,488 --> 00:59:44,138
In the meantime, we'll have to make up for the sales with another title.

929
00:59:44,138 --> 00:59:46,628
So, after Artist Baek returns in good health,

930
00:59:46,628 --> 00:59:51,308
he promised to wrap up the dragon series with us.

931
00:59:51,308 --> 00:59:53,718
Let's stay energized to the end.

932
00:59:53,718 --> 00:59:54,808
Okay.

933
00:59:54,808 --> 00:59:56,108
Daebak incident! Daebak incident!

934
00:59:56,108 --> 00:59:57,768
A huge daebak incident!

935
00:59:57,768 --> 00:59:58,588
What is it?

936
00:59:58,588 --> 01:00:03,588
Director Heo Kwan Yeong is being shaken upside down by the audit team.

937
01:00:17,828 --> 01:00:19,798
Who are you people?

938
01:00:19,798 --> 01:00:22,558
Director Heo Kwan Yeong, we're the audit team from headquarters.

939
01:00:22,558 --> 01:00:24,568
You'll have to cooperate with us for a moment.

940
01:00:24,568 --> 01:00:26,038
Please begin.

941
01:00:26,038 --> 01:00:27,798
Who gave you the order to do this?

942
01:00:27,798 --> 01:00:30,348
Will you be able to handle the aftermath?

943
01:00:40,368 --> 01:00:42,708
Be sure to look inside that drawer.

944
01:00:47,618 --> 01:00:53,148
CEO, why are you doing this all of a sudden?

945
01:00:53,148 --> 01:00:58,888
I thought you were an essential person to our company.

946
01:00:58,888 --> 01:01:01,938
On one hand, you could go overboard, but

947
01:01:01,938 --> 01:01:04,358
I thought we needed that kind of tension

948
01:01:04,358 --> 01:01:08,328
for our company's ecosystem to run well.

949
01:01:08,328 --> 01:01:13,458
But I received a report that I could not ignore.

950
01:01:14,468 --> 01:01:16,768
A report?

951
01:01:16,768 --> 01:01:18,928
I don't know what you heard from whom, butâ€”

952
01:01:18,928 --> 01:01:22,478
We could take this all the way.

953
01:01:22,478 --> 01:01:26,798
But I think it'd be most beautiful to see you

954
01:01:26,798 --> 01:01:29,638
leave on your own accord. Don't you think?

955
01:01:38,038 --> 01:01:40,408
This is how things end.

956
01:01:40,408 --> 01:01:43,748
Don't you feel total relief?

957
01:01:43,748 --> 01:01:45,068
It feels empty to me.

958
01:01:45,068 --> 01:01:46,498
Is it because I feel so out of it?

959
01:01:46,498 --> 01:01:50,118
But still, it's much better than his corruption being covered up.

960
01:01:50,118 --> 01:01:53,258
Well, I g-guess so.

961
01:01:58,598 --> 01:02:01,848
It worked out. It all worked out.

962
01:02:03,868 --> 01:02:06,648
Who's the one who did it...

963
01:02:14,368 --> 01:02:17,408
I'll go.

964
01:02:28,688 --> 01:02:32,848
I told the CEO everything.

965
01:02:33,618 --> 01:02:36,378
- What?
 - I gave her the content of what

966
01:02:36,378 --> 01:02:38,828
Director Heo asked me to do as well as the recording.

967
01:02:40,178 --> 01:02:44,688
It was obvious that Director Heo was the mastermind behind Artist Sin Dae Ryuk's incident.

968
01:02:44,688 --> 01:02:47,668
He wouldn't have left our team alone going forward, either.

969
01:02:49,298 --> 01:02:50,668
Jun Yeong...

970
01:02:50,668 --> 01:02:53,008
We said we'd fight all the way.

971
01:02:55,158 --> 01:02:57,278
Thank you.

972
01:03:20,668 --> 01:03:24,198
Honey, be good and come back to me.

973
01:03:27,908 --> 01:03:30,608
 Operating Center 

974
01:03:55,798 --> 01:03:58,048
Hyeong, are you all right?

975
01:03:58,958 --> 01:04:00,678
Yeah.

976
01:04:01,678 --> 01:04:04,298
Did you hear from Artist Baek Eo Jin?

977
01:04:04,298 --> 01:04:06,398
No. Not yet.

978
01:04:09,678 --> 01:04:11,248
Yes, ma'am.

979
01:04:11,248 --> 01:04:14,708
So, is he out of surgery?

980
01:04:17,618 --> 01:04:20,338
Oh, that's great!

981
01:04:20,338 --> 01:04:24,138
Yes, then we'll come by soon.

982
01:04:24,138 --> 01:04:26,508
Yes. I'll call you ahead of time.

983
01:04:26,508 --> 01:04:28,308
Yes.

984
01:04:28,308 --> 01:04:30,078
He's okay?

985
01:04:30,078 --> 01:04:32,358
Yes. He just came out of surgery.

986
01:04:32,358 --> 01:04:34,308
Everything went well, fortunately.

987
01:04:34,308 --> 01:04:35,398
That's good.

988
01:04:35,398 --> 01:04:36,978
Let's go to the hospital together later.

989
01:04:36,978 --> 01:04:39,268
- Okay.
 - May I

990
01:04:39,268 --> 01:04:40,768
also come with you?

991
01:04:40,768 --> 01:04:44,168
Artist Sin Dae Ryuk is also very worried. So he could come with us.

992
01:04:46,868 --> 01:04:48,618
Sure, let's go together.

993
01:04:48,618 --> 01:04:50,848
- Get ready.
 - Okay.

994
01:04:52,308 --> 01:04:55,938
 Intensive Care Unit 

995
01:04:58,628 --> 01:05:01,558
Why is he in the ICU when he's out of surgery?

996
01:05:01,558 --> 01:05:03,518
Perhaps the recovery room is in there.

997
01:05:03,518 --> 01:05:05,588
Oh, I see...

998
01:05:06,878 --> 01:05:08,108
Hello, ma'am.

999
01:05:08,108 --> 01:05:09,258
Hello!

1000
01:05:09,258 --> 01:05:11,258
Is something the matter, by chance?

1001
01:05:11,258 --> 01:05:14,328
My husband won't wake up.

1002
01:05:14,328 --> 01:05:15,868
Pardon?

1003
01:05:36,220 --> 01:05:46,400


1004
01:05:51,640 --> 01:05:57,800
â™«  The moment the darkness clears  â™«

1005
01:05:57,800 --> 01:06:01,530
â™«  In the warm wind full of sunshine  â™«

1006
01:06:01,530 --> 01:06:06,350
â™«  for myself I will open the wings which were folded   â™«  

1007
01:06:06,350 --> 01:06:09,610
â™«  Higher, get up higher  â™«

1008
01:06:09,610 --> 01:06:12,600
â™«  Fly, soar, fly in the sky  â™«

1009
01:06:12,600 --> 01:06:16,520
 Today's Webtoon 

1010
01:06:16,520 --> 01:06:20,350
 I didn't even get to thank him properly. 

1011
01:06:20,350 --> 01:06:24,080
 Do you think it would be a hit if you serialize it the way it is? PD On, just take your hands off of it. 

1012
01:06:24,080 --> 01:06:26,860
 It will be different this time around. 

1013
01:06:26,860 --> 01:06:31,920
 I regretted a lot after letting go of your hand back then. 

1014
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:34,650
 It feels like so many things have gotten better 

1015
01:06:34,650 --> 01:06:38,260
 after working with the team members. 

1016
01:06:38,260 --> 01:06:42,350
 I think the On Ma Eum that I know would've ultimately overcome the obstacle. 

1017
01:06:42,350 --> 01:06:44,930
 I realized it at that moment. 

1018
01:06:44,930 --> 01:06:50,680
 That I was ready to jump over the last hurdle. 

1019
01:06:52,910 --> 01:06:55,380
â™«  I walk alone in a long tunnel  â™«
