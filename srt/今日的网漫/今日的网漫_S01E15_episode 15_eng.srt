 Today's Webtoon 

3
00:00:44,977 --> 00:00:47,023
"Peeve Weapon" can't afford to waver.

4
00:00:47,023 --> 00:00:49,783
If there's no manuscript, that means there'll be a break.

5
00:00:49,783 --> 00:00:51,076
The responses will be bad.

6
00:00:51,076 --> 00:00:55,126
And it might cause a misunderstanding because of that incident.

7
00:01:16,243 --> 00:01:18,433
I just shared the folder with you.

 Peeve Weapon Episode 7 Manuscript 

11
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:37,803
Yes, Artist Sin.

12
00:01:37,803 --> 00:01:39,403
Yes, I just sent you the manuscript.

13
00:01:39,403 --> 00:01:40,573
 Peeve Weapon Episode 7 Manuscript 

14
00:01:40,573 --> 00:01:41,713
Yes, I got your email.

15
00:01:41,713 --> 00:01:44,303
I'll check and upload the files. Yes.

16
00:01:44,303 --> 00:01:47,233
I just checked Artist Sin Dae Ryuk's manuscript!

17
00:01:47,233 --> 00:01:50,713
First, send it over to the copy editing team, double-check it and upload it.

18
00:01:50,713 --> 00:01:52,223
Okay.

19
00:01:54,223 --> 00:01:56,223
 "Peeve Weapon" Episode 7 is attached 

20
00:02:06,693 --> 00:02:07,943
 Email sent 

21
00:02:10,883 --> 00:02:13,593
I sent it over to the copy editing team.

22
00:02:14,203 --> 00:02:16,173
Good work.

23
00:02:19,423 --> 00:02:21,113
 Episode 7 

24
00:02:21,723 --> 00:02:23,723
It's been uploaded!

25
00:02:24,473 --> 00:02:27,013
 11 p.m. "Peeve Weapon" posted 

26
00:02:27,013 --> 00:02:28,593
 Peeve Weapon 

27
00:02:30,493 --> 00:02:33,913
 An ending is the beginning of another "hope" 

28
00:02:36,223 --> 00:02:38,653
 An ending is the beginning of another "hope" 

29
00:02:40,453 --> 00:02:44,843
 So, is this place okay to stay? 

30
00:02:44,843 --> 00:02:48,473
 Just ... I don't think much.  I'm always that way. 

31
00:02:52,303 --> 00:02:55,100
 Look at this Hwi Yeong. Not only has a truly beautiful flower bloomed in a really unexpected place. 

32
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:57,600
 We call that hope. 

33
00:03:03,513 --> 00:03:05,793
 Hope... 

34
00:03:13,653 --> 00:03:16,903
 'Hope' is something you could protect. 

35
00:03:25,543 --> 00:03:28,953
'Hope' is something you could protect.

36
00:03:34,843 --> 00:03:36,883
PD On,

37
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:39,663
This is Artist Sin's manuscript, right?

38
00:03:43,093 --> 00:03:46,953
Artist Sin must've matured just as much as he suffered.

39
00:03:47,813 --> 00:03:49,833
You, too, PD On.

40
00:03:54,643 --> 00:03:58,873
- Gosh, I'm so sorry—
 - Good work, everyone!

41
00:03:58,873 --> 00:04:01,023
Gosh, go home, everyone.

42
00:04:01,023 --> 00:04:05,353
You should enjoy a break on deadline days, at least. Hurry up and go.

43
00:04:05,353 --> 00:04:08,243
I'll get going then. Good work.

44
00:04:08,873 --> 00:04:10,203
Good work!

45
00:04:10,203 --> 00:04:11,453
Good work!

46
00:04:11,453 --> 00:04:13,113
- Thank you! 
- Good work!

47
00:04:13,113 --> 00:04:14,793
Good job.

48
00:04:17,043 --> 00:04:18,723
Let's go.

49
00:04:21,233 --> 00:04:23,193
Good job.

50
00:04:27,713 --> 00:04:31,803
I'm sorry. It was my fault for putting you in a bind.

51
00:04:31,803 --> 00:04:34,693
I-I was too reckless.

52
00:04:34,693 --> 00:04:38,023
I... am grateful to you.

53
00:04:38,023 --> 00:04:41,033
Thanks to you, I think I've learned to be a team player.

54
00:04:43,315 --> 00:04:46,863
After my one and only support Noona passed away,

55
00:04:46,863 --> 00:04:50,303
I believed that it was right to live only trusting myself.

56
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:52,243
In this team,

57
00:04:52,243 --> 00:04:58,823
I feel like I'm relearning things that I had intentionally forgotten.

58
00:04:59,593 --> 00:05:02,533
So, if this is what I have to handle,

59
00:05:02,533 --> 00:05:05,153
I'd rather choose the side where I have to be accountable.

60
00:05:08,253 --> 00:05:10,003
It's interesting.

61
00:05:10,003 --> 00:05:11,793
You and me.

62
00:05:11,793 --> 00:05:13,673
We were so different before.

63
00:05:13,673 --> 00:05:18,853
You were at the end of that end there, and I was right over there.

64
00:05:20,033 --> 00:05:23,383
But we meet right here.

65
00:05:23,383 --> 00:05:25,283
You were North, and I was South.

66
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:30,103
Because we were so different, I think we're able to meet so nicely like this.

67
00:05:31,033 --> 00:05:33,203
Why? What? Is it too sentimental?

68
00:05:33,203 --> 00:05:34,633
No.

69
00:05:35,403 --> 00:05:38,853
If we got to meet because my polar opposite was you,

70
00:05:38,853 --> 00:05:41,493
then I'm glad I lived like that.

71
00:05:48,783 --> 00:05:51,963
Hey! You're even more sentimental!

72
00:05:51,963 --> 00:05:54,023
My gosh!

73
00:05:54,023 --> 00:05:57,063
We're having a sentimentalist contest today.

74
00:05:57,063 --> 00:06:00,643
Gosh, but still... one task wrapped up nicely.

75
00:06:00,643 --> 00:06:01,953
We'll have to grab a drink.

76
00:06:01,953 --> 00:06:04,433
You can't even drink!

77
00:06:04,433 --> 00:06:06,080
You're such a bluffer!

78
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:12,993
-  I'm home.  
 - Hey, you're home.

79
00:06:12,993 --> 00:06:14,863
Eonni, the new episode of Peeve Weapon is up.

80
00:06:14,863 --> 00:06:17,643
The reaction is totally hot.

81
00:06:17,643 --> 00:06:19,503
Oh, really?

82
00:06:19,503 --> 00:06:21,953
Guess what Dad is doing right now.

83
00:06:21,953 --> 00:06:23,733
What is he doing?

84
00:06:23,733 --> 00:06:25,553
Let's go upstairs.

85
00:06:25,553 --> 00:06:27,943
Let's go upstairs.

86
00:06:35,393 --> 00:06:37,413
I'm going crazy here.

87
00:06:40,033 --> 00:06:42,993
D-Dad, are you crying?

88
00:06:43,873 --> 00:06:46,243
Who's crying?

89
00:06:47,533 --> 00:06:51,313
Were you... reading... our webtoon?

90
00:06:51,313 --> 00:06:54,133
I was wondering what you were doing running around.

91
00:06:55,223 --> 00:06:56,663
Pretty amazing.

92
00:06:56,663 --> 00:06:58,883
Can't believe you worked on this.

93
00:06:58,883 --> 00:07:01,163
All you ever did was judo.

94
00:07:03,203 --> 00:07:05,103
It's tough, huh?

95
00:07:06,073 --> 00:07:08,123
Of course, it's tough.

96
00:07:09,483 --> 00:07:14,413
But... Dad, where I am right now... if I put all my heart*
  (On Ma Eum in Korean means "all my heart") 

97
00:07:14,413 --> 00:07:19,923
and all my strength into this work more and more...

98
00:07:19,923 --> 00:07:22,513
more people become happy.

99
00:07:22,513 --> 00:07:27,593
Each and every moment is a fight, but no one ever gets hurt.

100
00:07:27,593 --> 00:07:30,793
I'm so relieved by that, so no matter how tough it gets,

101
00:07:30,793 --> 00:07:34,213
I can work harder and harder each and every day.

102
00:07:37,573 --> 00:07:39,053
What are you doing?

103
00:07:39,053 --> 00:07:40,353
Don't be silly!

104
00:07:40,353 --> 00:07:42,633
- Come over here!
 - What's up with you now?

105
00:07:45,523 --> 00:07:47,173
Get away from him!

106
00:07:47,173 --> 00:07:49,113
Dad!

107
00:08:00,393 --> 00:08:02,153
Based on our research,

108
00:08:02,153 --> 00:08:06,083
the circumstances surrounding the recent post are strange.

109
00:08:06,083 --> 00:08:07,773
What's so strange about it?

110
00:08:07,773 --> 00:08:11,953
I heard that the one who posted said something strange when he met with my staff.

111
00:08:11,953 --> 00:08:16,673
Someone who knew of the incident asked him to do it and that's why he posted it.

112
00:08:16,673 --> 00:08:18,773
Along with a guarantee that it wouldn't be problematic,

113
00:08:18,773 --> 00:08:23,023
even if he posted a false story.

114
00:08:33,743 --> 00:08:35,363
I'm back!

115
00:08:35,363 --> 00:08:37,693
You're back.

116
00:08:37,693 --> 00:08:39,633
So, did it get resolved?

117
00:08:39,633 --> 00:08:41,493
Yeah.

118
00:08:41,493 --> 00:08:45,693
She said all the things we're planning are looking good. She says good luck.

119
00:08:45,693 --> 00:08:47,933
- What a relief!
 - So I was thinking,

120
00:08:47,933 --> 00:08:49,953
what do you think about putting together a contest?

121
00:08:49,953 --> 00:08:51,443
A contest?

122
00:08:51,443 --> 00:08:53,293
Right before the executives' meeting?

123
00:08:53,293 --> 00:08:55,673
There were quite a lot of issues surrounding Neon Webtoon.

124
00:08:55,673 --> 00:08:58,973
We can appeal to our audience with some good things at a time like this,

125
00:08:58,973 --> 00:09:03,073
and I think it'll be good if we can tie it to the new company and work on developing them.

126
00:09:03,073 --> 00:09:04,813
- I think that'd be great.
 - Right?

127
00:09:04,813 --> 00:09:06,283
I'm good here.

128
00:09:06,283 --> 00:09:08,693
I'm good here, too.

129
00:09:08,693 --> 00:09:10,883
Okay. We're all doing well.

130
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:14,323
Let's work a little harder to the end with a fighting spirit.

131
00:09:14,323 --> 00:09:16,783
- Fighting!
 - Fighting!

132
00:09:17,863 --> 00:09:21,243
Your mother is doing well at the hospital.

133
00:09:21,243 --> 00:09:24,283
Thank you, PD On.

134
00:09:27,243 --> 00:09:30,473
I think my job is over now.

135
00:09:30,473 --> 00:09:32,843
Dae Ryuk's work has stabilized now.

136
00:09:32,843 --> 00:09:36,713
I was so grateful for you, Artist Dong Hui.

137
00:09:36,713 --> 00:09:42,003
You were so, so, so big a help for Artist Sin as well as for me.

138
00:09:42,003 --> 00:09:43,993
Thank you so much.

139
00:09:45,843 --> 00:09:49,583
Thank you... so much, Hyeong.

140
00:09:51,533 --> 00:09:55,753
I was so shocked when you asked me to teach you how to add color.

141
00:09:55,753 --> 00:10:00,223
I'll watch you intently going forward and see if you're doing a good job.

142
00:10:00,223 --> 00:10:03,513
Speaking of, you have no idea how shocked I was

143
00:10:04,203 --> 00:10:06,633
when I saw that manuscript.

144
00:10:06,633 --> 00:10:11,353
How did you think of working on a color manuscript?

145
00:10:26,593 --> 00:10:28,783
It's so pretty.

146
00:10:28,783 --> 00:10:30,633
 I remember it. 

147
00:10:30,633 --> 00:10:34,863
 The moment in my life that wasn't in black and white. 

148
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:42,753
I had forgotten that I had such a memory.

149
00:10:48,513 --> 00:10:51,343
I learned a lot through the recent incident.

150
00:10:51,343 --> 00:10:53,703
It's all thanks to both of you.

151
00:10:53,703 --> 00:10:55,693
Thank you for everything.

152
00:10:56,913 --> 00:11:02,693
You can't forget Artist Sin, in your journey, the webtoon team members

153
00:11:02,693 --> 00:11:06,643
and hearts of numerous readers are with you

154
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:11,700
and that you're never alone.

155
00:11:13,373 --> 00:11:14,813
Okay.

156
00:11:29,513 --> 00:11:31,453
Artist Sin...

157
00:11:31,453 --> 00:11:34,823
You saw that, right? You saw that. One more time!

158
00:11:35,793 --> 00:11:39,213
- Whoa, Artist Sin!
 - Can you do that with me, too?

159
00:11:41,243 --> 00:11:43,963
 1. Company Overview, 2. Current Business Trend, 3. Market Analysis... 

160
00:11:43,963 --> 00:11:46,643
 1. Company Overview 

161
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:53,300
- I'm back! 
 - Hey!

162
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:55,643
Deputy Editor, you must be swamped.

163
00:11:55,643 --> 00:11:56,853
Coming from somewhere?

164
00:11:56,853 --> 00:11:59,463
Artist Dong Hui is headed home. So I went to say bye.

165
00:11:59,463 --> 00:12:01,643
He really went through a lot all this time.

166
00:12:01,643 --> 00:12:04,563
- Did you eat? 
 - No.

167
00:12:04,563 --> 00:12:07,213
- Did you eat, Deputy Editor? 
- I haven't eaten, either.

168
00:12:07,213 --> 00:12:08,863
Oh, yay!

169
00:12:08,863 --> 00:12:11,903
- Should we just go eat? 
- Would love to!

170
00:12:15,223 --> 00:12:16,853
There was still a place like this around?

171
00:12:16,853 --> 00:12:18,093
I know, right?

172
00:12:18,093 --> 00:12:20,573
The tteokbokki place that I used to go to with my friends in my childhood

173
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:23,823
also had walls you could write on.

174
00:12:28,903 --> 00:12:30,923
- Should we try it, too? 
 - Us too?

175
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
- Yeah. 
 - Sure.

176
00:12:33,003 --> 00:12:36,643
So, it'd be too trite to just write our names.

177
00:12:36,643 --> 00:12:38,333
How about we draw each other?

178
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:40,513
- Draw? 
- Yes.

179
00:12:41,493 --> 00:12:43,233
Sure.

180
00:13:16,583 --> 00:13:19,423
- It's cute. 
- What?

181
00:13:19,423 --> 00:13:21,643
Deputy Editor, your drawing is so expressive—

182
00:13:21,643 --> 00:13:23,733
You draw so well!

183
00:13:23,733 --> 00:13:27,453
Didn't I ever tell you that I wanted to me a cartoonist as a child?

184
00:13:27,453 --> 00:13:29,343
Really?

185
00:13:29,343 --> 00:13:32,753
No wonder you draw so well like a cartoonist.

186
00:13:32,753 --> 00:13:34,983
I'm not that good.

187
00:13:34,983 --> 00:13:38,713
I know I'm not that good. That's why I became an editor.

188
00:13:38,713 --> 00:13:42,053
I read this in a book a while ago.

189
00:13:42,053 --> 00:13:46,643
People like me are called "shadow artists."

190
00:13:46,643 --> 00:13:48,003
Shadow artists?

191
00:13:48,003 --> 00:13:52,043
Well, kind of like I want to create something,

192
00:13:52,043 --> 00:13:54,973
but I'm too afraid to become an artist.

193
00:13:54,973 --> 00:13:58,823
So, I choose to become a shadow to them.

194
00:14:00,353 --> 00:14:03,173
When I first read that,

195
00:14:03,173 --> 00:14:07,213
I felt somewhat disturbed and also felt guilty.

196
00:14:07,213 --> 00:14:09,113
But while working,

197
00:14:09,113 --> 00:14:13,290
my thoughts about being a shadow changed.

198
00:14:16,113 --> 00:14:18,863
 For one creative work of art to come out into the world, 

199
00:14:18,863 --> 00:14:22,423
 you can't do it with only one artist's effort. 

200
00:14:22,423 --> 00:14:24,433
 Even if his name isn't on the front page, 

201
00:14:24,433 --> 00:14:27,843
 what's worse, even if people aren't aware of his existence, 

202
00:14:27,843 --> 00:14:29,843
 he'd gladly become a shadow 

203
00:14:29,843 --> 00:14:33,883
 to support the artist, which is necessary. 

204
00:14:33,883 --> 00:14:37,393

208
00:14:46,193 --> 00:14:50,103
 I hope it becomes a good friend to you as well. 

209
00:14:50,103 --> 00:14:51,793
 Thank you. 

210
00:14:51,793 --> 00:14:56,263
 I think perhaps you need more courage and devotion 

211
00:14:56,263 --> 00:14:59,493
 than deciding to become an artist. 

212
00:14:59,493 --> 00:15:01,143
 All the luck that I have, 

213
00:15:01,143 --> 00:15:05,233
 I'd like to give it all to you, Artist Sin Dae Ryuk. 

214
00:15:05,943 --> 00:15:08,203
 When you're by my side, PD On, 

215
00:15:08,203 --> 00:15:12,043
 I think I can escape bad luck and misfortune.

 You're right.

218
00:15:17,923 --> 00:15:20,073
But in the beginning,

219
00:15:20,073 --> 00:15:25,603
I had my doubts as to whether or not you were a suitable person

220
00:15:25,603 --> 00:15:30,093
to be an editor since you would've always received support as an athlete.

221
00:15:30,093 --> 00:15:34,343
 The editor said that he saw something in you. 

222
00:15:34,343 --> 00:15:38,573
 But I have no idea what he's talking about. 

223
00:15:38,573 --> 00:15:40,463
 So, show me from now on 

224
00:15:40,463 --> 00:15:44,163
 that I'm wrong about you. 

225
00:15:44,163 --> 00:15:46,583
And you show it to me every time.

226
00:15:46,583 --> 00:15:48,660
Very dynamically at that.

As for doing well,

236
00:16:21,663 --> 00:16:25,513
I'll just do a little bit better.

237
00:16:25,513 --> 00:16:30,333
- Just a little bit?
 - Teeny tiny bit.

Okay. Just do teeny tiny bit better.

Oh, good work.

and for the second round...

00:17:18,433 --> 00:17:20,733
The important thing here is...

256
00:17:20,733 --> 00:17:24,443
We can put the number of users here.

257
00:17:24,443 --> 00:17:27,403
And we can adjust the schedule for the second season,

258
00:17:27,403 --> 00:17:29,743
and that would be a sure way to...

259

Oh, sounds good.

00:17:31,063 --> 00:17:34,013
If we put that in there...

261
00:17:34,013 --> 00:17:36,153
- Right, right.
 - We can use that.

262
00:17:36,153 --> 00:17:38,103
Right on.

263
00:17:45,543 --> 00:17:48,173
 - Welcome! 
 - Over here.

264
00:17:49,313 --> 00:17:50,943
Why did you want to meet here?

265
00:17:50,943 --> 00:17:54,083
This is the Webtoon Service Team's hangout, isn't it?

266
00:17:54,083 --> 00:17:56,423
I was always curious about it.

267
00:17:56,423 --> 00:17:58,613
They have really good fresh live octopus.

268
00:17:58,613 --> 00:18:00,623
How nice.

269
00:18:18,563 --> 00:18:20,093
Yes.

270
00:18:26,463 --> 00:18:28,463
Is the prep for the executives' meeting going well?

271
00:18:28,463 --> 00:18:32,583
We're doing our best for the time remaining.

272
00:18:32,583 --> 00:18:34,943
You remember the promise from back then, don't you?

273
00:18:35,653 --> 00:18:37,253
 Continuation of employment. 

274
00:18:37,253 --> 00:18:41,123
 Additionally, you want me to even rehire an employee who was laid off. 

275
00:18:41,123 --> 00:18:45,223
 Why should I have to accept that condition? 

276
00:18:45,223 --> 00:18:48,923
 I'll make us the top-notch company within three years. 

277
00:18:48,923 --> 00:18:54,626
 If I don't achieve that, I'll let everything go and leave. 

278
00:18:54,626 --> 00:18:57,553
 I don't like to bargain with people on the line. 

279
00:18:57,553 --> 00:19:01,323
 The people whom I'm putting on the line are more precious than life to me. 

280
00:19:01,323 --> 00:19:03,253
 That's why. 

281
00:19:03,253 --> 00:19:07,293
 It means I'll put my life on the line and work hard. 

282
00:19:09,343 --> 00:19:11,073
That's that.

283
00:19:11,073 --> 00:19:15,933
Why did you accept such a reckless condition back then?

284
00:19:15,933 --> 00:19:19,833
That was a short time after I had become a CEO.

285
00:19:19,833 --> 00:19:25,113
I wanted to learn from you, Team Leader Jang Man Cheol.

286
00:19:25,113 --> 00:19:27,643
You seemed like a very cool leader.

287
00:19:29,143 --> 00:19:32,323
And I also wanted to teach you.

288
00:19:33,323 --> 00:19:38,223
A leader should become powerful, not just be cool.

289
00:19:46,993 --> 00:19:48,413
I look forward to tomorrow.

290

Eonni has been sweeping in front of our house every morning lately.

Not just in front of our house. I swept even the streets over there early this morning.

Eonni has been doing this every day lately.

She says her work will go over well if she does good deeds or something like that.

Wait a minute.

I have some sticky rice cake (to help exam answers "stick").

313
00:21:06,463 --> 00:21:08,033
Oh, good, good.

00:21:43,403 --> 00:21:45,393
I'll be back.

322
00:22:54,013 --> 00:22:55,583
I'll take this back.

323
00:22:55,583 --> 00:22:57,373
It was mine, to begin with.

324
00:22:57,373 --> 00:22:58,703
What?

325
00:22:58,703 --> 00:23:01,823
Why? Do you still need it?

326
00:23:03,433 --> 00:23:06,463
Let's just believe, since we've done what we could,

327
00:23:06,463 --> 00:23:10,443
that good luck is always on our side.

328
00:23:17,993 --> 00:23:21,223
 Neon 

329
00:23:21,753 --> 00:23:23,723
Currently, "Peeve Weapon"

330
00:23:23,723 --> 00:23:27,433
is under a dramatization contract with Director Sin Ji Won, a hitmaker,

331
00:23:27,433 --> 00:23:30,533
and has produced the first step for IP (intellectual property) expansion.

332
00:23:30,533 --> 00:23:32,883
It is being produced as a series for a global OTT platform, so

333
00:23:32,883 --> 00:23:35,343
we anticipate huge marketing and promotional efforts.

334
00:23:35,343 --> 00:23:38,393
And if we produce season two, aligning the time frame with the drama,

335
00:23:38,393 --> 00:23:41,113
we can even aim for second IP expansion efforts.

336
00:23:41,113 --> 00:23:43,713
At such a crucial time as this,

337
00:23:43,713 --> 00:23:46,233
if a reckless plan to take over Young Toon

338
00:23:46,233 --> 00:23:48,243
jeopardizes our current plan,

339
00:23:48,243 --> 00:23:52,153
it will be a huge loss for Neon as a company.

340
00:23:52,153 --> 00:23:55,783
The work could continue even if the people change.

341
00:23:55,783 --> 00:23:58,243
I'm sure the PDs at Young Toon, who are at the top of their field,

342
00:23:58,243 --> 00:24:01,873
couldn't be worse than Neon PDs, right?

343
00:24:01,873 --> 00:24:06,893
In our Neon Webtoon, our work is based on bonding relationships between the

344
00:24:06,893 --> 00:24:09,093
PDs in charge and the artists.

345
00:24:09,093 --> 00:24:12,693
Artist Sin Dae Ryuk was personally discovered by PD On Ma Eum.

346
00:24:12,693 --> 00:24:16,283
As such, they have a much more dependent and trusting relationship.

347
00:24:16,283 --> 00:24:18,323
If the PD in charge were to change,

348
00:24:18,323 --> 00:24:22,553
season two of "Peeve Weapon" could be canceled entirely.

349
00:24:22,553 --> 00:24:24,633
What is the current profit for "Peeve Weapon"?

350
00:24:24,633 --> 00:24:26,263
It's one billion won per month.

351
00:24:26,263 --> 00:24:29,663
That amount excludes additional profits made from sales of goods or IP businesses.

352
00:24:29,663 --> 00:24:34,743
Then you can't ignore the projected profit from season two, either.

353
00:24:34,743 --> 00:24:36,543
That's right.

354
00:24:40,013 --> 00:24:44,343
I mean, webtoon dramatizations have always happened.

355
00:24:44,343 --> 00:24:48,543
It seems like a small issue for you to be presenting the project in such an ambitious manner.

356
00:24:48,543 --> 00:24:49,933
To be blunt,

357
00:24:49,933 --> 00:24:54,203
I'm sure Young Toon has many more projects that are being dramatized.

358
00:24:55,193 --> 00:24:56,783
That's right.

359
00:24:56,783 --> 00:24:58,813
You have a good point there.

360
00:24:58,813 --> 00:25:04,993
If so, what could be why Young Toon has taken the first spot in the industry?

361
00:25:04,993 --> 00:25:07,963
First, they own many projects.

362
00:25:07,963 --> 00:25:11,003
Second, they have many talented artists.

363
00:25:11,003 --> 00:25:13,033
To be more precise,

364
00:25:13,033 --> 00:25:14,760
they have an artist named Mo Yeong Su,

365
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:18,240
who is able to produce numerous titles.

366
00:25:18,243 --> 00:25:23,563
However, must Neon acquire Young Toon in order to obtain that same system?

367
00:25:23,563 --> 00:25:27,203
Can't Neon develop a system like that ourselve?

368
00:25:32,843 --> 00:25:35,913
 Plan for establishing Studio Ginger  
 In Neon, we have Artist Na Gang Nam,

369
00:25:35,913 --> 00:25:38,793
a great cartoonist that even Young Toon has been coveting.

370
00:25:38,793 --> 00:25:43,213
Currently, Artist Na Gang Nam owns vast content besides the titles he's serializing on Neon.

371
00:25:43,213 --> 00:25:45,063
If Neon provides him with a system that

372
00:25:45,063 --> 00:25:49,223
could serialize his content simultaneously through an affiliate company,

373
00:25:49,223 --> 00:25:52,753
it's possible to create consistently high profit

374
00:25:52,753 --> 00:25:57,213
with less money than required to purchase Young Toon.

375
00:25:58,813 --> 00:26:00,823
But in order to establish a company like this,

376
00:26:00,823 --> 00:26:04,113
shouldn't we have a trustworthy person go there as a CEO?

377
00:26:04,113 --> 00:26:05,883
You're right.

378
00:26:05,883 --> 00:26:09,933
Artist Na Gang Nam isn't knowledgeable about management.

379
00:26:09,933 --> 00:26:11,153
That's right.

380
00:26:11,153 --> 00:26:13,113
Yes.

381
00:26:13,113 --> 00:26:14,853
That's why...

382
00:26:15,843 --> 00:26:19,323
I recommend the deputy editor of Neon Webtoon, Seok Ji Hyeong,

383
00:26:19,323 --> 00:26:23,633
as a co-CEO of Studio Ginger.

384
00:26:25,423 --> 00:26:27,183
Deputy Editor Seok Ji Hyeong?

385
00:26:27,183 --> 00:26:28,533
Yes.

386
00:26:28,533 --> 00:26:33,213
Artist Na Gang Nam will be the CEO for creative content. 
  Studio Ginger Organizational Structure 

387
00:26:33,213 --> 00:26:35,663
Deputy Editor Seok Ji Hyeong

388
00:26:35,663 --> 00:26:38,303
is an elite who has various experience working in

389
00:26:38,303 --> 00:26:41,143
print comics, GingerToon, and Neon Webtoon.

390
00:26:41,143 --> 00:26:46,013
He, especially, has worked a long time with Artist Na Gang Nam as the PD in charge.

391
00:26:46,013 --> 00:26:49,663
We anticipate that they have quite a trusting relationship.

392
00:26:53,483 --> 00:26:54,880
Last of all,

393
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:58,630
I have one request.

394
00:26:58,633 --> 00:27:02,943
Just because one plows the soil, plants seeds, and waters the wasteland,

395
00:27:02,943 --> 00:27:05,883
you wouldn't call someone foolish.

396
00:27:05,883 --> 00:27:10,743
Because he knows a big tree will grow and he'll be rewarded with its fruit in the end.

397
00:27:10,743 --> 00:27:15,943
I believe you wouldn't make the mistake now of

398
00:27:15,943 --> 00:27:19,793
chopping down a small tree that just started to blossom.

399
00:27:20,873 --> 00:27:22,643
That is all.

400
00:27:56,813 --> 00:27:59,063
D-Did you do well?

401
00:28:02,613 --> 00:28:04,553
The fact that you'll be the CEO and will leave us...

402
00:28:04,553 --> 00:28:07,333
Should I tell the others or do you want to tell them?

403
00:28:14,848 --> 00:28:16,093
Congrats.

404
00:28:16,093 --> 00:28:17,743
Let's go!

405
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:20,580
‎

406
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:24,640
I wonder how happy they will be.

407
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:29,940
♫  Even today when I'm tired, my day is shining.  ♫

408
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:32,523
I'm back. 
 ♫  Everyday is my birthdayt  ♫

409
00:28:32,523 --> 00:28:36,023
So, what's the result? 
 ♫  Everyday is my birthdayt  ♫

410
00:28:37,513 --> 00:28:39,983
We did it. 
 ♫  I am like an awkward child  ♫

411
00:28:39,983 --> 00:28:42,443
What? 
 ♫  The little whisper of wind    ♫   

412
00:28:42,443 --> 00:28:45,553
It went well.
 ♫  and the warmth of the blazing sun   ♫   

413
00:28:45,553 --> 00:28:48,723
The evaluation of our future business endeavors was good.

414
00:28:48,723 --> 00:28:51,143
We need to prove it with our performance, but

415
00:28:51,143 --> 00:28:53,870
no one will shake us up until we get some results.

416
00:28:53,870 --> 00:28:57,340
♫   In the dark night when everyone is asleep,  ♫

417
00:28:57,340 --> 00:29:01,273
Oh, my God! 
 ♫   I'm the only one who forget to sleep  ♫

418
00:29:01,273 --> 00:29:03,363
I feel...

419
00:29:03,363 --> 00:29:06,473
I feel so bad and grateful at the same time, you know.

420
00:29:06,473 --> 00:29:09,353
Why are you saying that stuff? I'm going to cry.

421
00:29:09,353 --> 00:29:10,803
I really, really thank you.

422
00:29:10,803 --> 00:29:12,673
I'm just thankful.

423
00:29:12,673 --> 00:29:15,283
To each and every one of you here,

424
00:29:15,283 --> 00:29:19,483
we could never get this kind of result without you guys.

425
00:29:19,483 --> 00:29:23,523
Thank you... 
 ♫   A night dreaming dreams  ♫

426
00:29:23,523 --> 00:29:27,053
Shouldn't you say something like this as you give a toast at our team dinner?

427
00:29:27,053 --> 00:29:28,233
Team dinner sounds good.

428
00:29:28,233 --> 00:29:29,803
Another team dinner?

429
00:29:29,803 --> 00:29:32,123
- I'm not going.
 - Why not? This definitely calls for one.

430
00:29:32,123 --> 00:29:33,873
My soles hurt too much.

431
00:29:33,873 --> 00:29:36,116
Just don't take off your shoes. Your shoes.

432
00:29:36,116 --> 00:29:37,676
Me?

433
00:29:38,544 --> 00:29:41,123
Just drink moderately, and don't take off your shoes.

434
00:29:41,123 --> 00:29:43,223
Going shoeless is just the beginning.

435
00:29:43,223 --> 00:29:45,173
- Right, right, right.
 - So, you remember.

436
00:29:45,173 --> 00:29:47,273
- Of course, I do.
 - How do you remember that?

437
00:29:47,273 --> 00:29:49,043
Give me your attention for just a moment.

438
00:29:49,043 --> 00:29:51,013
I have an important announcement.

439
00:29:51,013 --> 00:29:53,103
What is it?

440
00:29:54,273 --> 00:29:55,783
Well...

441
00:29:56,423 --> 00:29:58,703
our Deputy Editor Seok Ji Hyeong

442
00:29:58,703 --> 00:30:02,643
has been appointed as the co-CEO of the new affiliate company Neon

443
00:30:02,643 --> 00:30:05,623
that we're developing with Artist Na Gang Nam.

444
00:30:05,623 --> 00:30:09,913
It means he'll be honorably leaving our Neon Webtoon.

445
00:30:11,313 --> 00:30:13,643
What in the world are you talking about all of a sudden?

446
00:30:13,643 --> 00:30:18,473
I wanted to tell you after the executives' meeting and after everything was decided.

447
00:30:18,473 --> 00:30:20,423
It's a shock to you all, huh?

448
00:30:24,113 --> 00:30:25,963
Tell them yourself.

449
00:30:32,673 --> 00:30:34,283
Well...

450
00:30:36,973 --> 00:30:41,563
ever since GingerToon days even before Neon Webtoon,

451
00:30:41,563 --> 00:30:45,143
we have all worked together,

452
00:30:45,143 --> 00:30:49,613
PD Kwon Yeong Bae, and PD Choi Du Hui,

453
00:30:49,613 --> 00:30:52,453
and PD Yu Mi.

454
00:30:53,323 --> 00:30:55,673
And our Hyeong Man Cheol.

455
00:30:56,743 --> 00:31:01,543
Wherever I may be and at any given point, I'll always cheer you on in my heart

456
00:31:01,543 --> 00:31:04,843
and I'll believe that we're all together.

457
00:31:05,743 --> 00:31:08,413
And our two newbie PDs.

458
00:31:08,413 --> 00:31:12,243
I was extremely concerned about you, but

459
00:31:12,243 --> 00:31:14,670
I have confirmed once again that you have the ability

460
00:31:14,670 --> 00:31:16,810
to ultimately take care of things on your own

461
00:31:16,813 --> 00:31:20,363
and what amazing PDs you are.

462
00:31:20,363 --> 00:31:22,553
So, I think I'll be able to

463
00:31:24,673 --> 00:31:27,663
leave you in peace.

464
00:31:27,663 --> 00:31:31,443
I'll cheer you on wherever I am.

465
00:31:31,443 --> 00:31:35,513
I think I'll feel like we're still working together.

466
00:31:35,513 --> 00:31:37,403
That's how I feel.

467
00:31:40,603 --> 00:31:44,763
This is a good thing. He's leaving because it's an opportunity for all of us to grow.

468
00:31:44,763 --> 00:31:48,203
And it's a company that'll continue to work with us.

469
00:31:48,203 --> 00:31:50,843
This time around, we can smile...

470
00:31:51,523 --> 00:31:53,733
Let's send him off with a smile.

471
00:31:54,783 --> 00:31:56,143
Gosh, I'm nervous.

472
00:31:56,143 --> 00:32:00,183
I mean, nothing's been decided. Why be nervous?

473
00:32:00,183 --> 00:32:01,543
In any case,

474
00:32:01,543 --> 00:32:03,973
- it's a good thing, right?
 - Sure.

475
00:32:03,973 --> 00:32:05,993
Let's congratulate him first.

476
00:32:05,993 --> 00:32:08,063
- Congratulations, CEO.
 - My gosh.

477
00:32:08,063 --> 00:32:09,373
Congratulations, CEO Seok!

478
00:32:09,373 --> 00:32:11,523
Gosh, thanks.

479
00:32:11,523 --> 00:32:14,363
Thank you for everything.

480
00:32:15,233 --> 00:32:17,293
Thanks to you, too.

481
00:32:19,503 --> 00:32:21,183
Your leaving is a good thing, but—

482
00:32:21,183 --> 00:32:24,433
- I'll have to become the deputy—
 - Toast.

483
00:32:24,433 --> 00:32:26,283
Okay, congratulations.

484
00:32:26,283 --> 00:32:27,813
Congratulations!

485
00:32:27,813 --> 00:32:30,423
Gosh, I feel so teary-eyed.

486
00:32:30,423 --> 00:32:32,723
I'm not comfortable being a deputy editor!

487
00:32:32,723 --> 00:32:34,587
Don't. Don't be uncomfortable.

488
00:32:34,587 --> 00:32:36,567
Then I'll do it.

489

 Thank you 

497
00:33:16,193 --> 00:33:17,753
 for letting me find out that I was wrong.

 you'll continue to do a good job, right?

506

 Do you like heads or tails? 

507
00:33:55,692 --> 00:33:58,795
 Oh, all of a sudden? 

508
00:33:58,795 --> 00:34:03,218
 I'll go with heads. 

509

♫  Like my mom  ♫

513
00:34:18,143 --> 00:34:21,458

00:34:21,458 --> 00:34:23,013
 What? 

515
00:34:23,013 --> 00:34:26,523

 Neon: Gu Jun Yeong, Webtoon Service 

529
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:50,400
 As Ma Eum said we would, our team survived. 

530
00:35:57,456 --> 00:36:00,741
Having a ball, huh, Webtoon Team?

531
00:36:00,741 --> 00:36:03,266
Yes, we're extremely excited.

532
00:36:06,065 --> 00:36:07,533
Settle down.

533
00:36:07,533 --> 00:36:08,963
You know this since you were in judo.

534
00:36:08,963 --> 00:36:13,433
At times, you need a referee's decision after the match is over.

535
00:36:13,433 --> 00:36:17,833
I believe our team won by one full point.

536
00:36:17,833 --> 00:36:19,363
Sure, fine.

537
00:36:19,363 --> 00:36:22,333
- Let's wait and see.
 - We'll get going then.

538
00:36:26,519 --> 00:36:29,249
Even a contractor looks down on me.

539
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:53,673
I'm sorry, but that's why we'll have to switch the PD in charge for you.

540
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:57,553
I don't think you need to do that.

541
00:36:57,553 --> 00:36:59,293
What do you mean?

542
00:36:59,293 --> 00:37:03,203
I'd like to suspend the series temporarily.

543
00:37:03,203 --> 00:37:05,783
Oh, sir, if you were offended by—

544
00:37:05,783 --> 00:37:07,633
No, I'm not.

545
00:37:09,142 --> 00:37:14,485
My back pain has become unbearable now.

546
00:37:15,468 --> 00:37:17,940
If I were to let it persist,

547
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:20,970
I'm sure I'd endure it somehow.

548
00:37:20,975 --> 00:37:24,020
But for me to complete my work properly,

549
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:27,750
I think surgery is necessary.

550
00:37:28,525 --> 00:37:34,278
Until my original manager in charge, PD Jung returns,

551
00:37:35,005 --> 00:37:37,265
I'll recover, and

552
00:37:38,535 --> 00:37:45,895
I plan to work on not losing my feel for the work.

553
00:37:45,895 --> 00:37:49,265
It must've not been an easy decision for you.

554
00:37:49,265 --> 00:37:51,665
I just feel bad.

555
00:37:51,665 --> 00:37:54,125
Because at such a crucial timing,

556
00:37:54,125 --> 00:37:57,065
I'll have to suspend my series.

557
00:37:57,065 --> 00:37:58,775
Gosh, no, sir.

558
00:37:58,775 --> 00:38:01,035
Your health takes priority over anything else.

559
00:38:01,035 --> 00:38:03,735
But since there are some saved manuscripts,

560
00:38:03,735 --> 00:38:07,045
the inactive period for the series will be shorter than expected.

561
00:38:07,045 --> 00:38:10,565
Please don't worry about any of that.

562
00:38:10,565 --> 00:38:13,875
Just think about your health, sir.

563
00:38:14,693 --> 00:38:19,428
Get plenty of rest and come back healthy.

564
00:38:20,499 --> 00:38:24,045
You didn't forget the promise you made with us, right?

565
00:38:24,045 --> 00:38:25,705
Your dragon series...

566
00:38:25,705 --> 00:38:28,795
We said we'd wrap it up nicely together.

567
00:38:28,795 --> 00:38:30,255
That's right.

568
00:38:30,255 --> 00:38:32,275
We did say that.

569
00:38:32,275 --> 00:38:38,155
You said that you'll put proper finishing touches on my cartoonist career.

570
00:38:38,155 --> 00:38:41,365
That you'd take care of it no matter what.

571
00:38:45,075 --> 00:38:47,035
Thank you.

572
00:38:49,424 --> 00:38:51,864
The smell? It doesn't smell, though...

573
00:38:51,864 --> 00:38:53,024
It does.

574
00:38:53,024 --> 00:38:55,134
How about this...

575
00:38:55,134 --> 00:38:56,224
Oh, okay...

576
00:38:56,224 --> 00:38:57,964
- I think th-this will be good.
 - No!

577
00:38:57,964 --> 00:39:00,214
Gosh, I can't eat it.

578
00:39:00,994 --> 00:39:02,054
Put it down. I don't want to eat it.

579
00:39:02,054 --> 00:39:06,244
- But still, you need to eat.
 - I won't eat. I can't eat anything!

580
00:39:06,244 --> 00:39:09,344
Oh, it must be Mandu.

581
00:39:15,544 --> 00:39:17,584
Ta-da!

582
00:39:17,584 --> 00:39:18,664
I'm here!

583
00:39:18,664 --> 00:39:21,574
Along with tteokbokki Ms. Han Seul likes.

584
00:39:21,574 --> 00:39:23,004
Tteokbokki?

585
00:39:23,004 --> 00:39:25,394
You can't eat tteokbokki...

586
00:39:25,394 --> 00:39:28,794
- Wow!
 - Her morning sickness is bad.

587
00:39:30,654 --> 00:39:32,044
You said you couldn't eat anything I gave you.

588
00:39:32,044 --> 00:39:33,894
I guess I wanted to see Mandu the most.

589
00:39:33,894 --> 00:39:37,664
Now that I see Mandu, the morning sickness has totally vanished.

590
00:39:40,584 --> 00:39:43,494
Artist Na, I'm sad.

591
00:39:43,494 --> 00:39:46,154
I heard you'll get to work with our deputy editor.

592
00:39:46,154 --> 00:39:48,694
How can you take away our deputy editor like that?

593
00:39:48,694 --> 00:39:49,834
Take away?

594
00:39:49,834 --> 00:39:53,434
They said they'll make sure my work will see the light of day and are tying me down.

595
00:39:53,434 --> 00:39:56,484
Then they should find someone to raise   my baby   (his work), too.

596
00:39:56,484 --> 00:39:57,754
Raise my baby?

597
00:39:57,754 --> 00:40:00,344
- Who's raising our baby?
 - No.

598
00:40:00,344 --> 00:40:02,334
I'll raise our kid.

599
00:40:02,334 --> 00:40:04,294
Eat now.

600
00:40:05,824 --> 00:40:09,854
How he's going to sell it is completely the PD's job.

601
00:40:09,854 --> 00:40:11,094
I have faith.

602
00:40:11,094 --> 00:40:16,124
If it's an editor like PD Seok, I'm sure he'll produce my webtoon in a fantastic way.

603
00:40:16,124 --> 00:40:19,904
You two are always such a fantastic duo.

604
00:40:19,904 --> 00:40:22,084
- What?
 - I mean...

605
00:40:22,084 --> 00:40:26,684
Deputy Editor said that it's entirely up to the artist to go from "zero" to "one."

606
00:40:26,684 --> 00:40:28,844
That there's nothing an editor could do for the artist.

607
00:40:28,844 --> 00:40:32,770
But you also said that turning that "one" into a bigger number

608
00:40:32,770 --> 00:40:36,260
is entirely up to the editor.

609
00:40:37,094 --> 00:40:39,264
It's like being a mom.

610
00:40:40,344 --> 00:40:43,424
Then is Deputy Editor Seok Ji Hyeong your mom?

611
00:40:43,424 --> 00:40:45,214
What now?

612
00:40:45,214 --> 00:40:48,054
You said you two made "Gumiho Princess" together from the very beginning.

613
00:40:48,054 --> 00:40:50,514
That's right! Y-You're... you're right, but...

614
00:40:50,514 --> 00:40:53,444
why? Why is something so gross?

615
00:40:53,444 --> 00:40:56,434
Whoa, that sounds weird to me, too.

616
00:41:05,994 --> 00:41:07,674
I'm late, huh? I'm sorry.

617
00:41:07,674 --> 00:41:09,814
I just got here, too.

618
00:41:09,814 --> 00:41:11,824
It was tough coming here after meeting your deadline, right?

619
00:41:11,824 --> 00:41:15,274
You had it harder, coming after your work.

620
00:41:16,004 --> 00:41:18,224
How are things at Neon these days?

621
00:41:18,224 --> 00:41:21,804
The atmosphere seems to have gotten better again.

622
00:41:21,804 --> 00:41:25,304
The winning prize for the upcoming contest is hefty, too.

623
00:41:27,614 --> 00:41:31,344
Don't you still think about webtoons?

624
00:41:38,784 --> 00:41:43,854
 Files and recordings 

625
00:41:56,914 --> 00:41:59,384
This isn't going to work for me, Director.

626
00:41:59,384 --> 00:42:01,624
Didn't you clearly say that it would be possible for us to

627
00:42:01,624 --> 00:42:04,874
take over the department at the cost you had promised?

628
00:42:04,874 --> 00:42:08,954
They're like weeds. I'm so sick and tired of them.

629
00:42:08,954 --> 00:42:13,584
The business ventures and investments I started, trusting what you said, cost a lot of money.

630
00:42:13,584 --> 00:42:16,214
I can't sort this out!

631
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:20,900
- CEO, Kim—
 - I will not go down alone.

632
00:42:20,974 --> 00:42:24,574
If the fact that you own our shares under a borrowed name is revealed,

633
00:42:24,574 --> 00:42:26,974
what do you think will happen?

634
00:42:29,014 --> 00:42:33,704
Whatever it takes, keep your promise.

635
00:42:43,864 --> 00:42:45,924
I'm tired...

636
00:42:59,724 --> 00:43:02,174
I don't have much to give you, but...

637
00:43:02,174 --> 00:43:06,214
What, what, what's this? You made my heart drop.

638
00:43:11,724 --> 00:43:12,824
I feel better now.

639
00:43:12,824 --> 00:43:15,444
I ran out of coffee anyway.

640
00:43:15,444 --> 00:43:18,804
So I was wondering if I should go out and get some.

641
00:43:20,694 --> 00:43:22,664
Feels much better.

642
00:43:23,444 --> 00:43:25,874
Anyway, aren't you going home?

643
00:43:25,874 --> 00:43:27,744
Even if I went home,

644
00:43:27,744 --> 00:43:30,884
I'd be checking out the works submitted for the contest.

645
00:43:31,874 --> 00:43:33,014
Why?

646
00:43:33,014 --> 00:43:34,964
Do I seem like I have no life?

647
00:43:34,964 --> 00:43:36,424
No, that's not it.

648
00:43:36,424 --> 00:43:37,794
I feel bad.

649
00:43:37,794 --> 00:43:39,994
The contest is not a small project.

650
00:43:39,994 --> 00:43:43,344
I wonder if I just put everything on your plate.

651
00:43:43,344 --> 00:43:45,074
This isn't the first time.

652
00:43:45,074 --> 00:43:47,524
I've done this ever since our GingerToon days.

653
00:43:47,524 --> 00:43:49,794
I feel even worse now.

654
00:43:52,784 --> 00:43:53,914
Is it hard?

655
00:43:53,914 --> 00:43:56,224
Of course, it's hard.

656
00:43:56,224 --> 00:44:00,534
I also want to have a hobby, hang out with my friends, too.

657
00:44:00,534 --> 00:44:04,014
Then why didn't you assert yourself more strongly?

658
00:44:04,014 --> 00:44:05,574
Go on a long vacation, too.

659
00:44:05,574 --> 00:44:07,444
Vacation?

660
00:44:07,444 --> 00:44:10,664
Do you know what I do on vacation?

661
00:44:11,684 --> 00:44:14,004
You must read webtoons!

662
00:44:14,004 --> 00:44:15,234
Yes.

663
00:44:15,234 --> 00:44:18,240
Even if I travel to a nice spot, I seek out a nice cafe and find myself reading webtoons.

664
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:20,760
and find myself reading webtoons.

665
00:44:20,764 --> 00:44:23,094
My gosh. You do the same thing I do.

666
00:44:23,094 --> 00:44:27,344
Makes me wonder why I choose to work like a dog when no one even acknowledges it.

667
00:44:27,344 --> 00:44:30,454
But when I see the work published, it feels like it was worth it.

668
00:44:30,454 --> 00:44:34,864
I think I still like this job a lot.

669
00:44:38,494 --> 00:44:40,604
We overcame our last hurdle nicely.

670
00:44:40,604 --> 00:44:43,654
So take a long vacation this time.

671
00:44:43,654 --> 00:44:47,484
Even if you read the webtoons, it's much nicer if you read them in a nice resort.

672
00:44:47,484 --> 00:44:49,484
Then send me away.

673
00:44:49,484 --> 00:44:51,544
Got it. Really, take a long vacation this time.

674
00:44:51,544 --> 00:44:52,814
All right.

675
00:44:52,814 --> 00:44:55,994
Oh, how is Artist Baek Eo Jin doing?

676
00:44:55,994 --> 00:44:59,064
He's getting a new PD in charge again.

677
00:45:02,784 --> 00:45:05,934
Artist Baek Eo Jin? A surgery?

678
00:45:05,934 --> 00:45:07,900
In his current condition,

679
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:11,050
I think he determined that it would be too much to show good work.

680
00:45:11,054 --> 00:45:13,044
That surgery must be pretty intense.

681
00:45:13,044 --> 00:45:14,974
I know.

682
00:45:14,974 --> 00:45:19,164
Since he took a big step and set his mind to it, we should respect his decision.

683
00:45:19,164 --> 00:45:22,534
In the end, he chose to do so for the sake of his work.

684
00:45:22,534 --> 00:45:24,964
His master mindset is on another level.

685
00:45:24,964 --> 00:45:27,080
He's amazing. Really.

686
00:45:27,994 --> 00:45:29,624
How is the contest going, PD Gi?

687
00:45:29,624 --> 00:45:32,294
We just have to select works for the finals.

688
00:45:32,294 --> 00:45:36,014
Those of you who haven't sent me your recommendations, please do so.

689
00:45:36,014 --> 00:45:38,254
- I made my selection.
 - What is it?

690
00:45:38,254 --> 00:45:40,014
"Travel Trouble."

691
00:45:40,014 --> 00:45:42,834
As for that one, I want to take on that project even if it doesn't win.

692
00:45:42,834 --> 00:45:46,064
It left such a strong impression on me.

693
00:45:46,064 --> 00:45:49,414
Didn't you pick that one, PD Kwon?

694
00:45:49,414 --> 00:45:53,914
He called first dibs on that one and said he wants to be in charge and serialize it.

695
00:45:53,914 --> 00:45:56,514
You two apparently are in sync.

696
00:45:56,514 --> 00:45:58,194
You guys were like this with Artist Gu Seul Ah, too.

697
00:45:58,194 --> 00:45:59,494
Wow, daebak.

698
00:45:59,494 --> 00:46:02,264
That daebak? That could happen.

699
00:46:02,264 --> 00:46:04,624
Then please take care of the contest, PD Gi.

700
00:46:04,624 --> 00:46:07,224
Does anyone have any other agenda items for discussion?

701
00:46:07,224 --> 00:46:09,104
No, right? Meeting adjourned.

702
00:46:09,104 --> 00:46:10,184
- On Ma Eum. 
- Yes?

703
00:46:10,184 --> 00:46:11,864
Talk to me before you go.

704
00:46:11,864 --> 00:46:12,764
Yes, sir.

705
00:46:12,764 --> 00:46:14,674
Thank you.

706
00:46:19,664 --> 00:46:22,114
Wow, daebak!

707
00:46:25,924 --> 00:46:29,504
How many years did you do judo, On Ma Eum?

708
00:46:29,504 --> 00:46:32,124
I did it for 15 years.

709
00:46:32,124 --> 00:46:37,414
Then let's work with me at Neon for exactly 15 years.

710
00:46:41,084 --> 00:46:43,874
What you're saying is...

711
00:46:43,874 --> 00:46:46,874
We're able to hire you full time.

712
00:46:49,164 --> 00:46:50,354
But how?

713
00:46:50,354 --> 00:46:54,004
It's all because you worked so hard, On Ma Eum.

714
00:46:54,004 --> 00:46:56,824
I mean, if they don't hire an employee who works so hard and is so passionate,

715
00:46:56,824 --> 00:46:58,514
it'd be a big loss for Neon.

716
00:46:58,514 --> 00:47:00,154
Congratulations.

717
00:47:00,154 --> 00:47:02,134
Enjoy the moment alone for a bit, then come out.

718
00:47:02,134 --> 00:47:04,014
Okay.

719
00:47:04,014 --> 00:47:06,324
Gosh, I love it.

720
00:47:31,494 --> 00:47:34,484
How long have you been standing here?

721
00:47:36,074 --> 00:47:38,014
Congratulations.

722
00:47:38,014 --> 00:47:40,454
♫  Congratulations  ♫

723
00:47:40,454 --> 00:47:42,554
♫  Congratulations  ♫

724
00:47:42,554 --> 00:47:47,274
♫  Congratulations on Ma Eum's full time employment  ♫

725
00:47:47,274 --> 00:47:49,764
PD On, congratulations on your full-time position.

726
00:47:49,764 --> 00:47:51,464
Wow, congratulations!

727
00:47:51,464 --> 00:47:53,774
Our team has double the celebration.

728
00:47:53,774 --> 00:47:55,264
Gosh, scared me.

729
00:47:55,264 --> 00:47:57,174
I told you I didn't want to do this.

730
00:47:57,734 --> 00:47:59,474
Good work, well, you know...

731
00:47:59,474 --> 00:48:02,854
We have similar tastes. Let's fight fiercely going forward.

732
00:48:02,854 --> 00:48:05,364
Sincere congratulations, Ma Eum.

733
00:48:05,364 --> 00:48:08,744
Oh, my, my, my... Who made you cry...

734
00:48:08,744 --> 00:48:11,584
Who did this? Aigoo, you deserve it.

735
00:48:11,584 --> 00:48:14,604
I'll work hard!

736
00:48:15,954 --> 00:48:17,904
Congrats!

737
00:48:23,544 --> 00:48:25,514
Okay, okay.

738
00:48:25,514 --> 00:48:28,314
Full time job! Let's go!

739
00:49:04,644 --> 00:49:10,430
 You did not pass the final interview for new hires at Neon 2022 

740
00:49:29,124 --> 00:49:33,094
 Neon, On Ma Eum, Webtoon Service 

741
00:49:44,804 --> 00:49:46,864
No one's home.

742
00:49:46,864 --> 00:49:49,244
I'm home!

743
00:49:49,244 --> 00:49:53,354
Ma Eum! Congratulations!

744
00:49:53,354 --> 00:49:56,194
You did it! Congratulations!

745
00:49:56,194 --> 00:49:58,914
- Here, here, here!
- Blow it out!

746
00:49:58,914 --> 00:50:00,934
♫  Congratulations  ♫

747
00:50:00,934 --> 00:50:04,694
♫  Congratulations  ♫

748
00:50:04,694 --> 00:50:08,134
♫  Congratulations  ♫

749
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:15,650
- On Ma. 
- On Ma!

750
00:50:15,650 --> 00:50:18,820
 On Ma Eum! 

751
00:50:18,820 --> 00:50:21,350
On Ma Eum!

752
00:50:23,684 --> 00:50:27,084
It's fun to plan out new projects together.

753
00:50:27,754 --> 00:50:30,444
Gosh, but I'm sad.

754
00:50:31,804 --> 00:50:33,034
About what?

755
00:50:33,034 --> 00:50:35,584
I shouldn't have followed my feeling so much on "Origin of Mankind"

756
00:50:35,584 --> 00:50:38,884
but should have met with you a lot, like this.

757
00:50:38,884 --> 00:50:41,604
Yeah, but it was a bit too, you know...

758
00:50:42,834 --> 00:50:44,854
My heart aches whenever I think about "Origin of Mankind."

759
00:50:44,854 --> 00:50:48,544
But I think you were right in ending it early, PD Choi.

760
00:50:48,544 --> 00:50:50,614
I got hurt so much from the vicious comments.

761
00:50:50,614 --> 00:50:54,404
I was pretty much in a coma even after it ended.

762
00:50:54,404 --> 00:50:57,114
Especially that Webtoon Witch.

763
00:50:57,114 --> 00:50:59,094
You all watched Webtoon Witch, right?

764
00:50:59,094 --> 00:51:01,064
- Yes.
 - I know!

765
00:51:01,064 --> 00:51:03,724
I was at a point where I couldn't even work because I got so furious.

766
00:51:03,724 --> 00:51:06,394
How could she read vicious comments in a series of clips?

767
00:51:06,394 --> 00:51:09,114
Is she a webtoon artist or something? How dare she do a series?

768
00:51:09,114 --> 00:51:11,534
When I read that the reason for reading "Origin of Mankind"

769
00:51:11,534 --> 00:51:15,844
was so they could enjoy Webtoon Witch's review...

770
00:51:15,844 --> 00:51:19,064
Gosh, seriously. It was traumatic.

771
00:51:22,174 --> 00:51:23,954
- PD On, are you bored?
 - Are you bored?

772
00:51:23,954 --> 00:51:25,884
Bored?

773
00:51:26,784 --> 00:51:29,074
That Webtoon Witch. Really.

774
00:51:29,074 --> 00:51:31,484
- You seem uncomfortable. 
- Uncomfortable.

775
00:51:31,484 --> 00:51:33,804
Uncomfortable? No, why_

776
00:51:33,804 --> 00:51:36,524
Gosh! I'll hit you, hit you. Seriously!

777
00:51:36,524 --> 00:51:38,584
I'll spank you.

778
00:51:40,074 --> 00:51:42,214
Should we go out and talk more?

779
00:51:42,214 --> 00:51:45,344
It was fun to have an idea meeting at a comic book cafe.

780
00:51:45,344 --> 00:51:47,594
Right. When we needed inspiration, we used to read comic books.

781
00:51:47,594 --> 00:51:48,774
Oh, yeah!

782
00:51:48,774 --> 00:51:50,814
You said your family runs a comic book cafe.

783
00:51:50,814 --> 00:51:52,464
Should we go there today?

784
00:51:52,464 --> 00:51:56,064
We can get inspired as well as freshen up.

785
00:51:56,064 --> 00:52:00,154
Aigoo, how did you even find out about that?

786
00:52:00,154 --> 00:52:03,664
Well, but... now is... um...

787
00:52:03,664 --> 00:52:05,294
Why?

788
00:52:06,494 --> 00:52:08,474
Oh, your parents don't like me, huh?

789
00:52:08,474 --> 00:52:11,904
No, no, no, no! My family really, really love you.

790
00:52:11,904 --> 00:52:15,134
But well, right now is a bit...

791
00:52:15,134 --> 00:52:17,584
Yeah, um... right now?

792
00:52:24,524 --> 00:52:25,774
Five boxes.

793
00:52:25,774 --> 00:52:29,214
- I'm home. 
- Welcome.

794
00:52:34,744 --> 00:52:36,614
Hello.

795
00:52:38,124 --> 00:52:40,454
Honey, come here.

796
00:52:40,454 --> 00:52:42,724
I'm not dreaming, am I?

797
00:52:42,724 --> 00:52:44,594
Gosh, it's not a dream. Sorry.

798
00:52:44,594 --> 00:52:46,714
Oh, my! Artist Oh Yun!

799
00:52:46,714 --> 00:52:48,134
Oh, my goodness!

800
00:52:48,134 --> 00:52:50,344
I'm a huge fan!

801
00:52:50,344 --> 00:52:51,434
Hey, what's going on?

802
00:52:51,434 --> 00:52:53,574
I heard PD On's family runs a comic book cafe,

803
00:52:53,574 --> 00:52:54,814
so I asked her to invite me.

804
00:52:54,814 --> 00:52:58,154
I love comic book cafes, too.

805
00:52:58,154 --> 00:52:59,264
Hello.

806
00:52:59,264 --> 00:53:01,034
- Hi!
 - Hello...

807
00:53:01,034 --> 00:53:03,694
I work with PD On Ma Eum. I'm PD Choi Du Hui.

808
00:53:03,694 --> 00:53:06,094
Hello, working hard, huh? Nice to meet you.

809
00:53:06,094 --> 00:53:10,284
Artist Oh, may I ask you for your autograph?

810
00:53:10,284 --> 00:53:11,834
Yes. Of course.

811
00:53:11,834 --> 00:53:15,134
Honey, the limited-edition of "Ghost Kitchen" is on the living room table.

812
00:53:15,134 --> 00:53:18,254
Bring me that, paper, and pen, please.

813
00:53:18,254 --> 00:53:21,934
Well, I'm... Ma Eum's dad.

814
00:53:21,934 --> 00:53:23,694
Please have a seat.

815
00:53:23,694 --> 00:53:26,584
Yes, have a seat.

816
00:53:26,584 --> 00:53:29,024
Where is Nu Ri?

817
00:53:29,024 --> 00:53:30,674
Hey, Nu Ri!

818
00:53:30,674 --> 00:53:33,814
Why is Dad going up so hurriedly?

819
00:53:38,554 --> 00:53:41,694
This is for real. S-So cover your mouth.

820
00:53:44,184 --> 00:53:46,454
Are you PD Ma Eum's younger sister?

821
00:53:46,454 --> 00:53:48,834
Yes. All right then...

822
00:53:48,834 --> 00:53:51,194
- Goodbye.
 - Nu Ri!

823
00:53:51,194 --> 00:53:52,464
Come here and say hello with me.

824
00:53:52,464 --> 00:53:54,124
Artist Oh says he'll give us an autograph.

825
00:53:54,124 --> 00:53:56,644
You read his webtoon every day.

826
00:53:56,644 --> 00:53:58,964
- No, I don't!
 - What do you mean, no?

827
00:53:58,964 --> 00:54:02,614
My younger daughter is a huge fan of webtoons, too.

828
00:54:02,614 --> 00:54:06,094
She reads your webtoon every day, and what was it again? "Origin of Mankind."

829
00:54:06,094 --> 00:54:09,594
She read that over and over and over again...

830
00:54:09,594 --> 00:54:11,524
I'm touched. Really.

831
00:54:11,524 --> 00:54:13,414
- How grateful, huh?
 - I know.

832
00:54:13,414 --> 00:54:16,724
I'm the PD in charge of that webtoon.

833
00:54:16,724 --> 00:54:19,144
Even the PD came by today.

834
00:54:19,144 --> 00:54:21,964
But you two must be so exhausted.

835
00:54:21,964 --> 00:54:23,914
Yes, you look so tired.

836
00:54:23,914 --> 00:54:24,964
Not at all.

837
00:54:24,964 --> 00:54:26,974
I feel like I'm getting energized not that I'm here.

838
00:54:26,974 --> 00:54:29,944
No, no. She's asking for your autograph, and the people recognize you and all.

839
00:54:29,944 --> 00:54:31,154
Then...

840
00:54:31,154 --> 00:54:33,504
Then you'll feel drained soon.

841
00:54:33,504 --> 00:54:35,274
Yes, drained.

842
00:54:35,274 --> 00:54:37,584
I love doing things like that.

843
00:54:37,584 --> 00:54:39,464
So cool!

844
00:54:39,464 --> 00:54:41,164
Just read your comic books.

845
00:54:41,164 --> 00:54:46,254
Hey, that's right. It'd be nice to interact with his fans.

846
00:54:46,254 --> 00:54:50,084
The customers who came today, it's your lucky day.

847
00:54:50,084 --> 00:54:52,844
So, why don't we do an autograph session right here?

848
00:54:52,844 --> 00:54:55,324
Why would we do an autograph session now?

849
00:54:55,324 --> 00:54:58,044
There are quite a lot of crazy fans.

850
00:54:58,044 --> 00:54:59,884
Yes, it's dangerous here.

851
00:54:59,884 --> 00:55:01,504
This place is dangerous.

852
00:55:01,504 --> 00:55:03,444
I guess that could be. Shall we go now?

853
00:55:03,444 --> 00:55:05,564
- Oh, my.
 - We can just talk about work and—

854
00:55:05,564 --> 00:55:07,544
- We should talk about work...
- I'll take them back.

855
00:55:07,544 --> 00:55:11,134
 - Why rush out?
 - I'll be back. 

856
00:55:12,504 --> 00:55:14,624
Gosh, this isn't it. Oh, my!

857
00:55:14,624 --> 00:55:15,814
Gosh, what to do...

858
00:55:15,814 --> 00:55:17,484
I found it. Ghost...

859
00:55:17,484 --> 00:55:19,924
They all left!

860
00:55:19,924 --> 00:55:22,384
Aren't you crazy?

861
00:55:24,394 --> 00:55:26,064
- Hey, On Nu Ri.
 - What?

862
00:55:26,064 --> 00:55:27,944
Look what happened. It's all your fault!

863
00:55:27,944 --> 00:55:30,234
You led them out, too. Why blame it on me?

864
00:55:30,234 --> 00:55:33,724
So, why did you have to cause the reason I had to lead him out?

865
00:55:33,724 --> 00:55:35,494
You trashed Artist Oh Yun's work so much.

866
00:55:35,494 --> 00:55:37,714
What if he recognized you as Webtoon Witch? He would've freaked out.

867
00:55:37,714 --> 00:55:39,774
Webtoon Witch?

868
00:55:41,454 --> 00:55:44,594
Were you there all along?

869
00:55:44,594 --> 00:55:46,634
Webtoon Witch, that person...

870
00:55:46,634 --> 00:55:49,104
She was trashing the webtoon that Ma Eum created.

871
00:55:49,104 --> 00:55:51,694
That was you, Nu Ri?

872
00:55:51,694 --> 00:55:53,764
What's Webtoon Witch?

873
00:55:53,764 --> 00:55:55,664
Nu Ri, did you trash talk your eonni?

874
00:55:55,664 --> 00:55:58,054
Gosh, what do you mean trash talk?

875
00:55:58,054 --> 00:56:00,404
Critique. Use a high-quality word.

876
00:56:00,404 --> 00:56:02,654
Then you should've told your sister in advance.

877
00:56:02,654 --> 00:56:05,034
You knew she was upset about it.

878
00:56:06,004 --> 00:56:07,654
I started it first,

879
00:56:07,654 --> 00:56:10,644
even before Eonni became a webtoon PD.

880
00:56:11,614 --> 00:56:14,814
I'm sorry that I couldn't tell you because I missed my timing.

881
00:56:14,814 --> 00:56:17,864
But I didn't mean to do this, either.

882
00:56:17,864 --> 00:56:20,444
You always say it's all my fault, Mom.

883
00:56:21,380 --> 00:56:22,824
What's with her?

884
00:56:22,824 --> 00:56:24,864
What happened?

885
00:56:24,864 --> 00:56:26,664
It's nothing.

886
00:56:26,664 --> 00:56:29,314
So, what is it?

887
00:56:29,314 --> 00:56:31,684
I wasn't trying to do this.

888
00:56:54,053 --> 00:56:57,903
I didn't want to tell Mom and Dad like that.

889
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:01,687
Sorry.

890
00:57:01,687 --> 00:57:03,537
It's okay.

891
00:57:07,953 --> 00:57:14,633
Recently, I heard that my job is like being a shadow-artist.

892
00:57:14,633 --> 00:57:17,103
I identified with it.

893
00:57:17,103 --> 00:57:22,543
Webtoon PDs really stay by the webtoon artists quietly like their shadows.

894
00:57:22,543 --> 00:57:26,713
And people often don't know of our existence, like shadows.

895
00:57:28,714 --> 00:57:31,774
It's not like you wanted it to happen, but

896
00:57:31,774 --> 00:57:34,510
I wonder how you must've felt being

897
00:57:34,510 --> 00:57:38,200
someone else's shadow as a young child.

898
00:57:39,593 --> 00:57:43,883
Because I was in judo ever since our childhood, Mom and Dad took care of only me.

899
00:57:43,883 --> 00:57:47,923
That was upsetting and sad for you, right?

900
00:57:51,133 --> 00:57:54,153
You'd be so cool if you received the spotlight.

901
00:57:54,153 --> 00:57:56,863
Honestly, that Webtoon Witch...

902
00:57:56,863 --> 00:57:59,103
Gosh, I get so pissed, but

903
00:57:59,103 --> 00:58:02,293
I watched it to the end because it was so fun. How annoying.

904
00:58:03,883 --> 00:58:06,903
- Really?
 - Yeah, really.

905
00:58:08,323 --> 00:58:11,383
While assisting artists these days,

906
00:58:11,383 --> 00:58:13,173
I'm reminded of times

907
00:58:13,173 --> 00:58:18,503
when my family sacrificed so much when I used to do judo.

908
00:58:20,043 --> 00:58:24,493
From now on, I'll give you some information

909
00:58:24,493 --> 00:58:29,973
in the webtoon world and help Webtoon Witch.

910
00:58:34,673 --> 00:58:35,950
And,

911
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:41,270
I know you started it first.

912
00:58:42,398 --> 00:58:45,868
You got me started in the webtoon world, too.

913
00:58:48,008 --> 00:58:52,938
When I got injured, you're the one who recommended "Gumiho Princess."

914
00:58:53,828 --> 00:58:57,078
I started liking webtoons because of that one.

915
00:58:57,898 --> 00:59:02,908
On one hand, it's thanks to you that I became a webtoon PD.

916
00:59:07,488 --> 00:59:11,318
Thank you so much for letting me find something I love

917
00:59:12,088 --> 00:59:15,678
as much as I love judo. I mean it.

918
00:59:16,738 --> 00:59:19,228
I couldn't hear you well.

919
00:59:19,228 --> 00:59:21,048
What did you say?

920
00:59:22,958 --> 00:59:24,538
Thanks.

921
00:59:24,538 --> 00:59:26,168
I mean it.

922
00:59:26,168 --> 00:59:27,208
Happy now?

923
00:59:27,208 --> 00:59:28,888
Got it!

924
00:59:28,888 --> 00:59:31,768
- Happy now?
 - Yup!

925
00:59:32,498 --> 00:59:35,798
Artist Baek's surgery is tomorrow.

926
00:59:35,798 --> 00:59:37,198
Yeah.

927
00:59:37,198 --> 00:59:40,488
It'll take several months for him to recover from his surgery.

928
00:59:40,488 --> 00:59:44,138
In the meantime, we'll have to make up for the sales with another title.

929
00:59:44,138 --> 00:59:46,628
So, after Artist Baek returns in good health,

930
00:59:46,628 --> 00:59:51,308
he promised to wrap up the dragon series with us.

931
00:59:51,308 --> 00:59:53,718
Let's stay energized to the end.

932
00:59:53,718 --> 00:59:54,808
Okay.

933
00:59:54,808 --> 00:59:56,108
Daebak incident! Daebak incident!

934
00:59:56,108 --> 00:59:57,768
A huge daebak incident!

935
00:59:57,768 --> 00:59:58,588
What is it?

936
00:59:58,588 --> 01:00:03,588
Director Heo Kwan Yeong is being shaken upside down by the audit team.

937
01:00:17,828 --> 01:00:19,798
Who are you people?

938
01:00:19,798 --> 01:00:22,558
Director Heo Kwan Yeong, we're the audit team from headquarters.

939
01:00:22,558 --> 01:00:24,568
You'll have to cooperate with us for a moment.

940
01:00:24,568 --> 01:00:26,038
Please begin.

941
01:00:26,038 --> 01:00:27,798
Who gave you the order to do this?

942
01:00:27,798 --> 01:00:30,348
Will you be able to handle the aftermath?

943
01:00:40,368 --> 01:00:42,708
Be sure to look inside that drawer.

944
01:00:47,618 --> 01:00:53,148
CEO, why are you doing this all of a sudden?

945
01:00:53,148 --> 01:00:58,888
I thought you were an essential person to our company.

946
01:00:58,888 --> 01:01:01,938
On one hand, you could go overboard, but

947
01:01:01,938 --> 01:01:04,358
I thought we needed that kind of tension

948
01:01:04,358 --> 01:01:08,328
for our company's ecosystem to run well.

949
01:01:08,328 --> 01:01:13,458
But I received a report that I could not ignore.

950
01:01:14,468 --> 01:01:16,768
A report?

951
01:01:16,768 --> 01:01:18,928
I don't know what you heard from whom, but—

952
01:01:18,928 --> 01:01:22,478
We could take this all the way.

953
01:01:22,478 --> 01:01:26,798
But I think it'd be most beautiful to see you

954
01:01:26,798 --> 01:01:29,638
leave on your own accord. Don't you think?

955
01:01:38,038 --> 01:01:40,408
This is how things end.

956
01:01:40,408 --> 01:01:43,748
Don't you feel total relief?

957
01:01:43,748 --> 01:01:45,068
It feels empty to me.

958
01:01:45,068 --> 01:01:46,498
Is it because I feel so out of it?

959
01:01:46,498 --> 01:01:50,118
But still, it's much better than his corruption being covered up.

960
01:01:50,118 --> 01:01:53,258
Well, I g-guess so.

961
01:01:58,598 --> 01:02:01,848
It worked out. It all worked out.

962
01:02:03,868 --> 01:02:06,648
Who's the one who did it...

963
01:02:14,368 --> 01:02:17,408
I'll go.

964
01:02:28,688 --> 01:02:32,848
I told the CEO everything.

965
01:02:33,618 --> 01:02:36,378
- What?
 - I gave her the content of what

966
01:02:36,378 --> 01:02:38,828
Director Heo asked me to do as well as the recording.

967
01:02:40,178 --> 01:02:44,688
It was obvious that Director Heo was the mastermind behind Artist Sin Dae Ryuk's incident.

968
01:02:44,688 --> 01:02:47,668
He wouldn't have left our team alone going forward, either.

969
01:02:49,298 --> 01:02:50,668
Jun Yeong...

970
01:02:50,668 --> 01:02:53,008
We said we'd fight all the way.

971
01:02:55,158 --> 01:02:57,278
Thank you.

972
01:03:20,668 --> 01:03:24,198
Honey, be good and come back to me.

973
01:03:27,908 --> 01:03:30,608
 Operating Center 

974
01:03:55,798 --> 01:03:58,048
Hyeong, are you all right?

975
01:03:58,958 --> 01:04:00,678
Yeah.

976
01:04:01,678 --> 01:04:04,298
Did you hear from Artist Baek Eo Jin?

977
01:04:04,298 --> 01:04:06,398
No. Not yet.

978
01:04:09,678 --> 01:04:11,248
Yes, ma'am.

979
01:04:11,248 --> 01:04:14,708
So, is he out of surgery?

980
01:04:17,618 --> 01:04:20,338
Oh, that's great!

981
01:04:20,338 --> 01:04:24,138
Yes, then we'll come by soon.

982
01:04:24,138 --> 01:04:26,508
Yes. I'll call you ahead of time.

983
01:04:26,508 --> 01:04:28,308
Yes.

984
01:04:28,308 --> 01:04:30,078
He's okay?

985
01:04:30,078 --> 01:04:32,358
Yes. He just came out of surgery.

986
01:04:32,358 --> 01:04:34,308
Everything went well, fortunately.

987
01:04:34,308 --> 01:04:35,398
That's good.

988
01:04:35,398 --> 01:04:36,978
Let's go to the hospital together later.

989
01:04:36,978 --> 01:04:39,268
- Okay.
 - May I

990
01:04:39,268 --> 01:04:40,768
also come with you?

991
01:04:40,768 --> 01:04:44,168
Artist Sin Dae Ryuk is also very worried. So he could come with us.

992
01:04:46,868 --> 01:04:48,618
Sure, let's go together.

993
01:04:48,618 --> 01:04:50,848
- Get ready.
 - Okay.

994
01:04:52,308 --> 01:04:55,938
 Intensive Care Unit 

995
01:04:58,628 --> 01:05:01,558
Why is he in the ICU when he's out of surgery?

996
01:05:01,558 --> 01:05:03,518
Perhaps the recovery room is in there.

997
01:05:03,518 --> 01:05:05,588
Oh, I see...

998
01:05:06,878 --> 01:05:08,108
Hello, ma'am.

999
01:05:08,108 --> 01:05:09,258
Hello!

1000
01:05:09,258 --> 01:05:11,258
Is something the matter, by chance?

1001
01:05:11,258 --> 01:05:14,328
My husband won't wake up.

1002
01:05:14,328 --> 01:05:15,868
Pardon?

1003
01:05:36,220 --> 01:05:46,400


1004
01:05:51,640 --> 01:05:57,800
♫  The moment the darkness clears  ♫

1005
01:05:57,800 --> 01:06:01,530
♫  In the warm wind full of sunshine  ♫

1006
01:06:01,530 --> 01:06:06,350
♫  for myself I will open the wings which were folded   ♫  

1007
01:06:06,350 --> 01:06:09,610
♫  Higher, get up higher  ♫

1008
01:06:09,610 --> 01:06:12,600
♫  Fly, soar, fly in the sky  ♫

1009
01:06:12,600 --> 01:06:16,520
 Today's Webtoon 

1010
01:06:16,520 --> 01:06:20,350
 I didn't even get to thank him properly. 

1011
01:06:20,350 --> 01:06:24,080
 Do you think it would be a hit if you serialize it the way it is? PD On, just take your hands off of it. 

1012
01:06:24,080 --> 01:06:26,860
 It will be different this time around. 

1013
01:06:26,860 --> 01:06:31,920
 I regretted a lot after letting go of your hand back then. 

1014
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:34,650
 It feels like so many things have gotten better 

1015
01:06:34,650 --> 01:06:38,260
 after working with the team members. 

1016
01:06:38,260 --> 01:06:42,350
 I think the On Ma Eum that I know would've ultimately overcome the obstacle. 

1017
01:06:42,350 --> 01:06:44,930
 I realized it at that moment. 

1018
01:06:44,930 --> 01:06:50,680
 That I was ready to jump over the last hurdle. 

1019
01:06:52,910 --> 01:06:55,380
♫  I walk alone in a long tunnel  ♫

1020
01:06:55,380 --> 01:06:58,103
