1
00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:08,020


2
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:34,030
 Today's Webtoon 

3
00:00:53,825 --> 00:00:55,995
Can you give that to me?

4
00:00:58,535 --> 00:01:01,205
How did you come here, Jun Yeong?

5
00:01:05,615 --> 00:01:10,235
That gift, give it to me.

6
00:01:18,005 --> 00:01:24,015
 Episode 10: A star doesn't disappear. It reappears someday. 

7
00:01:24,015 --> 00:01:28,185
 I heard that Young Toon's next editor-in-chief will get an amazing offer. 

8
00:01:28,185 --> 00:01:31,765
 They're contacting Ji Hyeong. 

9
00:01:38,725 --> 00:01:40,435
Going home?

10
00:01:42,625 --> 00:01:45,535
Do you want to grab a drink?

11
00:01:45,535 --> 00:01:47,325
Why not?

12
00:01:56,205 --> 00:01:57,945
On Ma Eum!

13
00:01:59,132 --> 00:02:00,745
Your boyfriend?

14
00:02:00,745 --> 00:02:04,945
No, no. He's just a coworker.

15
00:02:06,875 --> 00:02:09,705
I guess you had a friend coming.

16
00:02:09,705 --> 00:02:11,075
I'll take my leave.

17
00:02:11,075 --> 00:02:14,425
Why are you leaving already? Let's drink together.

18
00:02:14,425 --> 00:02:16,915
Yes, you came this far. Let's drink together.

19
00:02:16,915 --> 00:02:20,515
It's okay. You two have a good time.

20
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:21,875
Come on.

21
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:24,075
Where do you think you're going?

22
00:02:25,595 --> 00:02:29,385
Then, I'll stay for a bit and leave.

23
00:02:29,385 --> 00:02:30,345
Okay.

24
00:02:30,345 --> 00:02:33,285
Could we have some glasses, and you're drinking beer, right?

25
00:02:33,285 --> 00:02:35,895
One beer and one Sprite, please.

26
00:02:35,895 --> 00:02:37,625
 Okay. 

27
00:02:38,995 --> 00:02:43,195
- Do you want to switch seats? 
 - It's fine as is.

28
00:02:43,195 --> 00:02:44,485
You said you were having a hard time,

29
00:02:44,485 --> 00:02:47,815
but you had a reason for having a good time at work.

30
00:02:48,555 --> 00:02:50,965
What do you mean?

31
00:02:52,885 --> 00:02:54,475
I got a call from Mom.

32
00:02:54,475 --> 00:02:58,035
I'm going to catch this call, but you're dead meat if you say weird stuff.

33
00:02:58,035 --> 00:03:01,515
She knows me too well.

34
00:03:04,325 --> 00:03:06,175
Oh, thanks.

35
00:03:08,885 --> 00:03:12,455
Hello, I'm Ma Eum's friend, Lee Eun Yeong.

36
00:03:12,455 --> 00:03:15,115
Hello, my name is Gu Jun Yeong.

37
00:03:15,115 --> 00:03:17,565
I'm working as a webtoon PD with Ma Eum.

38
00:03:17,565 --> 00:03:19,895
If you don't mind me asking, your age is...?

39
00:03:19,895 --> 00:03:21,975
- I'm 26.
 - We're the same age.

40
00:03:21,975 --> 00:03:23,965
Let me pour you a glass.

41
00:03:35,875 --> 00:03:38,885
- Thank you.
 - Wait, wait, wait.

42
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:40,055
He can't drink alcohol.

43
00:03:40,055 --> 00:03:42,495
You can't drink, you know.

44
00:03:43,775 --> 00:03:45,985
Drink Sprite.

45
00:03:47,025 --> 00:03:48,175
Here you go.

46
00:03:48,175 --> 00:03:50,395
Thank you.

47
00:03:50,395 --> 00:03:51,995
What is this?

48
00:03:51,995 --> 00:03:54,675
You two are coworkers and the same age.

49
00:03:54,675 --> 00:03:56,075
Why so polite?

50
00:03:56,075 --> 00:03:58,035
I thought she was your seonbae.

51
00:03:58,715 --> 00:04:00,795
Is that so?

52
00:04:02,645 --> 00:04:04,280
I want to be friends.

53
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,055
Is it uncomfortable?

54
00:04:06,055 --> 00:04:08,315
No. I like it.

55
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:16,900
We should also skip the honorifics.  Shall we?

56
00:04:19,535 --> 00:04:21,055
Okay.

57
00:04:21,055 --> 00:04:23,955
You asked first, okay?

58
00:04:23,955 --> 00:04:26,425
Okay then, shall we start for real?

59
00:04:26,425 --> 00:04:27,975
Okay. Shall we all drink?

60
00:04:27,975 --> 00:04:29,865
"Shall?"

61
00:04:30,495 --> 00:04:33,195
Have... a drink... let's?

62
00:04:33,195 --> 00:04:35,985
It's not going to work. You drink, too.

63
00:04:35,985 --> 00:04:37,195
Here.

64
00:04:37,195 --> 00:04:39,615
Shall... Let me pour you one?

65
00:04:39,615 --> 00:04:41,745
"Shall? Let me?"

66
00:04:42,565 --> 00:04:45,795
- Shall we? 
- I will. I will pour you a glass.

67
00:04:45,795 --> 00:04:47,785
Good, good.

68
00:04:51,885 --> 00:04:54,525
- You're home. 
 - Where's Ma Eum?

69
00:04:54,525 --> 00:04:57,315
Not here yet. It looked like she was having a drink with Eun Yeong.

70
00:04:57,315 --> 00:04:58,945
I see.

71
00:05:01,205 --> 00:05:04,275
Dear. Try some watermelon. It's so sweet.

72
00:05:04,275 --> 00:05:06,095
Yeah, Dad. Try some. It's very sweet.

73
00:05:06,095 --> 00:05:07,815
- You move. 
 - Why?

74
00:05:07,815 --> 00:05:09,705
I'll wash my hands first.

75
00:05:09,705 --> 00:05:11,875
Why pick on me?

76
00:05:12,605 --> 00:05:15,715
 Ma Eum's Room 

77
00:05:15,715 --> 00:05:19,325
Then, Artist Ma Hae Gyu went to a rehab center? 
  Small Cart Bar 

78
00:05:19,325 --> 00:05:21,865
Yeah. He said he'll come back after getting treatment.

79
00:05:21,865 --> 00:05:25,215
He asked us to look after Yu Na while he's gone.

80
00:05:25,215 --> 00:05:27,575
Good for him.

81
00:05:32,055 --> 00:05:34,885
What exactly do you want to tell me?

82
00:05:37,315 --> 00:05:39,485
What do I want to tell you?

83
00:05:45,315 --> 00:05:47,405
I was offered the chief editor position at Young Toon.

84
00:05:47,405 --> 00:05:49,465
Really? Hey!

85
00:05:49,465 --> 00:05:51,575
Wow! That's great news!

86
00:05:51,575 --> 00:05:53,595
You should've been one a long time ago.

87
00:05:53,595 --> 00:05:55,445
It's actually a bit late for you.

88
00:05:55,445 --> 00:05:57,925
Hey, congrats!

89
00:05:57,925 --> 00:06:01,045
Your time to shine is finally here.

90
00:06:05,331 --> 00:06:06,795
Nice.

91
00:06:06,795 --> 00:06:10,305
I was just offered. Just an offer.

92
00:06:10,305 --> 00:06:14,685
I'm telling you only because I don't want you to hear from someone else.

93
00:06:14,685 --> 00:06:18,045
With this kind of stuff, you can accept it first and then tell me.

94
00:06:18,045 --> 00:06:21,255
These chances don't come by often. Especially from that Young Toon.

95
00:06:21,255 --> 00:06:23,545
Also, it's not like anyone can be a chief editor.

96
00:06:23,545 --> 00:06:28,125
You can do it with this perfect timing and an incredible opportunity.

97
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:31,805
I'm so happy for you.

98
00:06:31,805 --> 00:06:33,885
Congrats, man.

99
00:06:36,575 --> 00:06:39,485
It's not perfect timing for us.

100
00:06:45,975 --> 00:06:48,405
Just think about yourself.

101
00:06:54,505 --> 00:06:56,385
It's here.

102
00:06:57,505 --> 00:06:59,155
Hyeong.

103
00:07:01,315 --> 00:07:05,035
Ji Hyeong. Even if...

104
00:07:05,035 --> 00:07:08,485
I change my mind and cling to you,

105
00:07:08,485 --> 00:07:12,155
you just make sure

106
00:07:12,155 --> 00:07:15,105
to think about only yourself until the very end.

107
00:07:15,105 --> 00:07:18,508
I'm saying to decide with yourself as the top priority.

108
00:07:18,508 --> 00:07:23,551
That's the only advice I can give you as your

109
00:07:23,551 --> 00:07:26,011
long-time hyeong and as your colleague.

110
00:07:31,615 --> 00:07:33,435
I'm going now.

111
00:07:39,275 --> 00:07:41,345
Take care, Hyeong.

112
00:07:47,845 --> 00:07:51,355
 I mean, you still should've set up a future meeting. 

113
00:07:51,355 --> 00:07:53,925
 What can I do when Artist Ha doesn't even let me talk about a meeting 

114
00:07:53,925 --> 00:07:57,635
 saying, "Why do you need to put my cartoon on the internet?" 

115
00:07:57,635 --> 00:08:01,765
 How can he send me away at the door when we've known each other for so long? 

116
00:08:01,765 --> 00:08:05,735
 But you did set a meeting with Artist Yeom tomorrow, right? 

117
00:08:08,385 --> 00:08:09,965
 Yeah. 

118
00:08:10,905 --> 00:08:13,915
 Hyeong, this is seriously an employment fraud. 

119
00:08:13,915 --> 00:08:15,115
 I mean... 

120
00:08:15,115 --> 00:08:17,755
 you brought someone who was set to transfer to another publishing hous— 

121
00:08:17,755 --> 00:08:18,975
 What do you mean fraud? 

122
00:08:18,975 --> 00:08:22,285
 The future is opening for the webtoon. 

123
00:08:22,285 --> 00:08:24,365
 The Golden Age. 

124
00:08:25,805 --> 00:08:26,765
 Golden. 

125
00:08:26,765 --> 00:08:29,335
 Th-That conman... 

126
00:08:29,335 --> 00:08:30,845
 Fun Maru 

127
00:08:30,845 --> 00:08:32,225
 Funny Toony 

128
00:08:32,225 --> 00:08:34,235
 Webtoon Bottle 

129
00:08:34,235 --> 00:08:37,385
 JinjyeoriToon, Ginger Toon?
  (Jinjyeori, sounds like "Gingery," means sick and tired of.) 

130
00:08:37,385 --> 00:08:39,285
 - Ji Hyeong.
 - Yes? 

131
00:08:39,285 --> 00:08:41,445
 How is this for the logo? 

132
00:08:41,445 --> 00:08:42,355
 GingerToon? 

133
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:45,355
 - You said to go with GingerToon. 
 -  Hyeong. 

134
00:08:46,065 --> 00:08:47,975
 But it's still a company name. 

135
00:08:47,975 --> 00:08:50,335
 Isn't JinjyeoriToon and this picture too much? 

136
00:08:50,335 --> 00:08:53,095
 You said you don't like Jinjyeori, so we're going with GingerToon. 

137
00:08:53,095 --> 00:08:56,240
 But the only thing GingerToon reminds you of is the gingerbread man. 

138
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:08,720
 GingerToon 

139
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:20,475
 GingerToon 

140
00:09:21,155 --> 00:09:23,935
Can you just help with organizing these?

141
00:09:26,945 --> 00:09:28,195
 We have to go now. We're late! 

142
00:09:28,195 --> 00:09:29,555
 Wait, wait! 

143
00:09:29,555 --> 00:09:32,235
 - Why?
 - The contract is missing. 

144
00:09:32,235 --> 00:09:33,935
 Didn't you leave it there before? 

145
00:09:33,935 --> 00:09:37,395
-  It's not here. Where did it go?  
- U-Unni, it's here.

146
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:40,525
 Oh, yes. Thank you, thank you! 

147
00:09:40,525 --> 00:09:42,245
 Hurry and go now. 

148
00:09:42,245 --> 00:09:43,715
 We'll be back. 

149
00:09:43,715 --> 00:09:46,045
 I'm going, going. I'll be back! 

150
00:09:46,045 --> 00:09:48,515
 - Take care.
 - We'll be back! 

151
00:09:51,485 --> 00:09:53,125
 Everyone! 

152
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:57,945
 Finally, Artist Hae Su also signed the contract with GingerToon! 

153
00:10:06,505 --> 00:10:09,285
 Hurray! 

154
00:10:10,385 --> 00:10:13,435
 As soon as he saw the contract, it was a done deal! 

155
00:10:13,435 --> 00:10:15,235
 I knew it! 

156
00:10:15,235 --> 00:10:16,715
 We need to take a picture on a day like this. 

157
00:10:16,715 --> 00:10:18,785
 - A picture.
 - Okay. 

158
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:21,355
 - Ten seconds.
 - Hurry! Come, come! 

159
00:10:21,355 --> 00:10:23,615
 - Ten seconds.
 - Same pose, everyone. 

160
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:25,095
 One, two, three. 

161
00:10:25,095 --> 00:10:26,615
 When is it? 

162
00:10:26,615 --> 00:10:28,915
 Just keep smiling. 

163
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:34,400
 Ginger 
 Toon 

164
00:10:48,795 --> 00:10:50,395
Deputy Editor.

165
00:10:50,395 --> 00:10:52,095
Yeah?

166
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:56,585
This is the OST production proposal.

167
00:10:56,585 --> 00:10:59,535
- Please confirm.
 - Oh, okay.

168
00:11:02,195 --> 00:11:05,845
Is this... confirmed with the artists?

169
00:11:05,845 --> 00:11:10,315
Yes. I'm planning to meet Artists Pomme and Sin Dae Ryuk today and tell them.

170
00:11:10,315 --> 00:11:12,535
I see, okay.

171
00:11:12,535 --> 00:11:15,535
- Good luck.
 - Thanks.

172
00:11:15,535 --> 00:11:16,925
By the way...

173
00:11:16,925 --> 00:11:19,545
What are all these?

174
00:11:21,275 --> 00:11:23,965
Stuff from GingerToon days.

175
00:11:31,145 --> 00:11:32,695
You're here.

176
00:11:32,695 --> 00:11:34,795
- Hello.
 - PD On Ma Eum is here, too?

177
00:11:34,795 --> 00:11:37,445
I came because I missed you.

178
00:11:37,445 --> 00:11:39,755
Come this way, please.

179
00:11:41,505 --> 00:11:43,095
They are my assistants.

180
00:11:43,095 --> 00:11:45,305
They are Neon Webtoon PDs. Say hi to each other.

181
00:11:45,305 --> 00:11:47,375
Hello.

182
00:11:48,155 --> 00:11:50,295
Nice to meet you.

183
00:11:50,295 --> 00:11:52,445
I'm PD On Ma Eum.

184
00:11:52,445 --> 00:11:55,295
Hello, I'm PD Gu Jun Yeong.

185
00:12:03,956 --> 00:12:07,355
In the midst of all this, I'm glad that the assistants are nearby.

186
00:12:07,355 --> 00:12:10,195
We won't be falling behind the schedule, thanks to you two.

187
00:12:10,195 --> 00:12:12,355
Right, Artist Pomme?

188
00:12:12,355 --> 00:12:16,815
PD Gu here is always worrying about deadlines.

189
00:12:19,175 --> 00:12:24,465
As I told you before, I'm always worried about you, above all.

190
00:12:25,415 --> 00:12:28,875
I don't know. You don't sound sincere.

191
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:30,915
Say something for me.

192
00:12:31,585 --> 00:12:32,845
What?

193
00:12:32,845 --> 00:12:36,605
About my sincerity.

194
00:12:37,525 --> 00:12:39,455
I don't know about that.

195
00:12:40,235 --> 00:12:42,045
Just once.

196
00:12:42,045 --> 00:12:43,945
Well, yeah...

197
00:12:44,645 --> 00:12:47,005
I said I don't know.

198
00:12:47,775 --> 00:12:50,055
I'll do my best.

199
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:33,845
 Artist Sin. I told you this last time. 

200
00:13:33,845 --> 00:13:35,565
 Yes, your cartoon is important 

201
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:38,135
 but it's not as valuable as people. 

202
00:13:38,135 --> 00:13:42,505
 You're also included in that "people." 

203
00:13:43,305 --> 00:13:48,795
 Eat well and sleep well. 

204
00:14:04,305 --> 00:14:06,235
This is great!

205
00:14:06,235 --> 00:14:10,015
It's definitely distinct from existing characters.

206
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:11,545
What do you think?

207
00:14:11,545 --> 00:14:13,555
The facial expressions are good.

208
00:14:13,555 --> 00:14:15,545
However...

209
00:14:17,475 --> 00:14:20,535
she seems oddly familiar.

210
00:14:22,025 --> 00:14:23,362
Really?

211
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:27,008
I don't think any of the characters remind me of anyone.

212
00:14:28,734 --> 00:14:33,045
If it's okay, I'll add the colors and finish.

213
00:14:33,045 --> 00:14:34,518
Okay.

214
00:14:34,518 --> 00:14:37,808
Did you review the OST-related paperwork?

215
00:14:38,415 --> 00:14:41,865
I think Ji Hyeong will go to Young Toon this time.

216
00:14:41,865 --> 00:14:43,055
Excuse me?

217
00:14:43,055 --> 00:14:44,985
Geez, you scared me.

218
00:14:44,985 --> 00:14:46,685
Deputy Editor is...

219
00:14:46,685 --> 00:14:48,225
Wh-Why to Young Toon?

220
00:14:48,225 --> 00:14:50,525
He always has a lot of offers.

221
00:14:50,525 --> 00:14:53,045
But he already rejected Young Toon once.

222
00:14:53,045 --> 00:14:56,095
He came here with us instead of going to Young Toon when GingerToon was being dissolved.

223
00:14:56,095 --> 00:14:58,395
This time is different.

224
00:14:58,395 --> 00:15:00,885
It's an offer for the chief editor position.

225
00:15:02,035 --> 00:15:07,775
The chief editor position is not an easily found opportunity, right?

226
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:09,925
Right. He'd be called a fool to reject

227
00:15:09,925 --> 00:15:14,065
the terms that come with the offer of being a chief editor.

228
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:20,805
 Young Toon? 

229
00:15:37,925 --> 00:15:40,105
Where are you going? A meeting?

230
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:42,275
To see Artist Oh Yun.

231
00:15:42,955 --> 00:15:45,905
- You decided?
 - Yes.

232
00:15:47,405 --> 00:15:49,945
I still don't think it'll be easy.

233
00:15:52,675 --> 00:15:54,805
I'll be back.

234
00:15:56,665 --> 00:15:59,260
Should I get you a pep pill?

235
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:02,010
 The door is closing. 

236
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:03,955
Fighting.

237
00:16:31,995 --> 00:16:33,285
Nice.

238
00:16:33,285 --> 00:16:34,625
Okay.

239
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:37,065
Two remaining.

240
00:16:40,225 --> 00:16:43,665
What the heck? I'm winning right now.

241
00:16:50,576 --> 00:16:53,155
I texted you several times yesterday that I'll be visiting,

242
00:16:53,155 --> 00:16:55,355
but you didn't answer.

243
00:16:55,355 --> 00:16:57,178
I also called you in front of your house,

244
00:16:57,178 --> 00:16:59,318
but you didn't answer.

245
00:17:00,565 --> 00:17:03,235
I didn't know because it was hectic.

246
00:17:10,575 --> 00:17:12,855
It's tough on you these days, right?

247
00:17:12,855 --> 00:17:15,525
Your manuscript isn't progressing, either.

248
00:17:21,175 --> 00:17:24,035
It's always tough.

249
00:17:24,035 --> 00:17:26,845
It's not like this is my first or second year in the field.

250
00:17:26,845 --> 00:17:30,135
There are times when things don't work out like this.

251
00:17:30,135 --> 00:17:32,685
I'm sure it'll work itself out.

252
00:17:36,675 --> 00:17:38,995
Will it really?

253
00:17:39,665 --> 00:17:44,025
This is your first time staying in the low rankings for so long.

254
00:17:44,025 --> 00:17:46,505
You did get tired a little bit here and there.

255
00:17:46,505 --> 00:17:48,535
But you were never lost like this.

256
00:17:48,535 --> 00:17:50,805
I'm not lost.

257
00:17:50,805 --> 00:17:54,765
I'm going my way, but the people are not recognizing it.

258
00:17:54,765 --> 00:17:57,455
That's what gets me frustrated.

259
00:17:57,455 --> 00:18:00,785
And I suddenly start thinking,

260
00:18:01,485 --> 00:18:04,245
"Did I go the wrong way in the first place?"

261
00:18:07,405 --> 00:18:10,705
Did I really start off on the wrong foot?

262
00:18:14,895 --> 00:18:16,675
What is this?

263
00:18:16,675 --> 00:18:19,745
You also said it was interesting after listening to my explanation.

264
00:18:19,745 --> 00:18:23,355
You said it's all fine. You said let's go with the series as is.

265
00:18:27,155 --> 00:18:29,055
I'm sorry.

266
00:18:29,755 --> 00:18:31,335
It's my fault.

267
00:18:31,335 --> 00:18:32,975
What?

268
00:18:36,045 --> 00:18:40,745
If I could turn back time, if I could have another chance,

269
00:18:41,675 --> 00:18:45,075
I would've mustered up more courage and opposed it strongly.

270
00:18:45,075 --> 00:18:47,315
I wanted to follow your opinion as much as possible.

271
00:18:47,315 --> 00:18:53,415
I was also afraid that you might go somewhere else if I opposed you.

272
00:18:53,415 --> 00:18:56,165
But I think that was a dereliction of duty on my part.

273
00:18:56,165 --> 00:18:59,320
When I saw the first synopsis and storyboards for "Origin of Mankind,"

274
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:02,140
it was very difficult and obscure.

275
00:19:02,145 --> 00:19:06,595
I also thought it was a genre where your forte wouldn't come through.

276
00:19:07,605 --> 00:19:09,975
What is my forte?

277
00:19:12,335 --> 00:19:15,015
Silly jokes?

278
00:19:15,015 --> 00:19:18,445
Making people happy, whoever that is.

279
00:19:21,815 --> 00:19:23,945
A comedy webtoon, huh...

280
00:19:23,945 --> 00:19:27,335
I'm not in the mood to laugh at all.

281
00:19:34,935 --> 00:19:36,925
Don't lose, don't lose.

282
00:19:36,925 --> 00:19:40,445
 I was sure that I had met a genius then. 

283
00:19:44,215 --> 00:19:45,885
Why?

284
00:19:46,585 --> 00:19:47,905
What is it?

285
00:19:47,905 --> 00:19:50,915
Th-This is so... Aigoo, aigoo.

286
00:19:50,915 --> 00:19:53,115
I'm fine, fine.

287
00:19:53,115 --> 00:19:55,395
 What is he doing? 

288
00:19:57,315 --> 00:19:59,765
 Do you remember the first thing I said when I met you? 

289
00:19:59,765 --> 00:20:01,855
I'm going crazy.

290
00:20:08,675 --> 00:20:12,135
"This world needs your webtoon."

291
00:20:12,135 --> 00:20:16,125
"Because at least while someone is reading this webtoon,

292
00:20:17,445 --> 00:20:20,165
he will be genuinely happy."

293
00:20:22,635 --> 00:20:24,155
Okay.

294
00:20:24,155 --> 00:20:26,315
That was true.

295
00:20:29,325 --> 00:20:33,725
I heard you say that then, and I got so excited.

296
00:20:37,855 --> 00:20:42,638
I thought I had kissed my debut goodbye when GingerToon vanished.

297
00:20:42,638 --> 00:20:46,288
But I was able to make a grand debut with you at Neon.

298
00:20:57,165 --> 00:20:59,845
You trusted me back then.

299
00:21:02,605 --> 00:21:05,975
Please trust me one more time.

300
00:21:05,975 --> 00:21:10,605
Your humor is warm, not cynical or on edge.

301
00:21:10,605 --> 00:21:12,785
It has humanism.

302
00:21:14,065 --> 00:21:18,405
I also know that you planned "Origin of Mankind" because you wanted to show humanism.

303
00:21:18,405 --> 00:21:20,728
It's not just because of the revenue.

304
00:21:20,728 --> 00:21:24,368
For your own good, I realized that it's right to decide quickly,

305
00:21:25,125 --> 00:21:28,405
after much consideration as the PD.

306
00:21:29,035 --> 00:21:32,495
If my decision turns out wrong, you can reprimand me all you want.

307
00:21:32,495 --> 00:21:34,965
However. I, Choi Du Hui,

308
00:21:36,855 --> 00:21:39,945
think that it's about time to fold "Origin of Mankind"

309
00:21:41,315 --> 00:21:45,415
and prepare a new work as our next hand.

310
00:22:07,095 --> 00:22:09,825
I was going to trample on all those people

311
00:22:10,745 --> 00:22:15,175
who said my success only happened because of my looks and the media,

312
00:22:15,902 --> 00:22:18,885
saying that my work is shallow.

313
00:22:18,885 --> 00:22:22,065
I was going to shut up all those people who said

314
00:22:22,065 --> 00:22:24,975
that I can only make people laugh.

315
00:22:39,875 --> 00:22:41,795
Artist Oh.

316
00:22:43,605 --> 00:22:45,855
Making other people laugh...

317
00:22:46,735 --> 00:22:49,185
is the hardest thing to do.

318
00:22:52,895 --> 00:22:56,855
No one does it better than you in this country.

319
00:22:58,815 --> 00:23:02,825
I hope that you'll take pride in that.

320
00:23:06,595 --> 00:23:08,835
PD Choi...

321
00:23:35,135 --> 00:23:40,635
 I never once thought about Deputy Editor not being here. 

322
00:23:54,935 --> 00:23:57,215
Your total is 5,000 won.

323
00:23:58,205 --> 00:24:01,395
- One more of the same thing, please.
 - Okay.

324
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:06,270
Thank you.

325
00:24:08,985 --> 00:24:13,495
Thinking that Deputy Editor Seok might leave,

326
00:24:13,495 --> 00:24:15,355
I just can't focus on work.

327
00:24:15,355 --> 00:24:18,195
Is it to that point?

328
00:24:19,065 --> 00:24:22,055
I mean, changing jobs is quite common these days.

329
00:24:22,055 --> 00:24:25,205
Especially since he was offered the position of chief editor,

330
00:24:25,205 --> 00:24:28,400
- I think it's a congratulatory thing.
 - Yes. That's true.

331
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:32,240
It's congratulatory for him, a hundred times over.

332
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:35,935
I just feel sad about it.

333
00:24:38,075 --> 00:24:40,615
Since he's my first immediate supervisor.

334
00:24:42,505 --> 00:24:46,005
I guess you relied on him a lot.

335
00:24:46,005 --> 00:24:47,795
Yeah.

336
00:24:48,515 --> 00:24:50,565
I did.

337
00:24:52,965 --> 00:24:55,345
I did learn a lot from him, too.

338
00:24:56,205 --> 00:25:01,415
I only troubled him thus far and came up with lots of hassles.

339
00:25:02,195 --> 00:25:04,885
I should've learned the trade faster

340
00:25:06,495 --> 00:25:09,265
had I known that he was going to leave so soon.

341
00:25:18,775 --> 00:25:20,615
Is it hot?

342
00:25:22,705 --> 00:25:24,535
No, no.

343
00:25:28,935 --> 00:25:31,970
 Answer Right Away 

344
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:33,830
Excuse me.

345
00:25:40,455 --> 00:25:42,165
Yes.

346
00:25:53,905 --> 00:25:55,975
Do you also work out, Mr. Gu?

347
00:25:55,975 --> 00:25:59,265
Taking care of yourself is important these days.

348
00:25:59,265 --> 00:26:02,445
I sometimes jog to ease my mind.

349
00:26:02,445 --> 00:26:05,985
My, my. Doing cardio alone is not enough exercise.

350
00:26:05,985 --> 00:26:11,355
Real men should lift some weights.

351
00:26:11,355 --> 00:26:12,945
I see.

352
00:26:17,605 --> 00:26:20,415
- Pardon? 
 - Towel.

353
00:26:23,785 --> 00:26:25,575
Thank you.

354
00:26:33,245 --> 00:26:36,575
Do you have something else for me to do?

355
00:26:36,575 --> 00:26:38,725
I think I sent you all the information you needed.

356
00:26:38,725 --> 00:26:40,645
- Are you sure? 
- Yes.

357
00:26:40,645 --> 00:26:44,485
You don't even know what I'll need.

358
00:26:47,915 --> 00:26:49,605
I noticed last time that

359
00:26:49,605 --> 00:26:53,198
PD Kwon's revenue portion was a lot larger than everyone else's.

360
00:26:53,198 --> 00:26:57,149
I'd like to see his artist candidates or a list of researched information.

361
00:26:57,149 --> 00:27:01,419
Well, that's PD Kwon's personal documents...

362
00:27:04,105 --> 00:27:08,035
That's what I want to see.

363
00:27:08,035 --> 00:27:13,795
While it's a risk for a single PD to take up a majority of the revenue pie,

364
00:27:13,795 --> 00:27:16,765
he also keeps the core info to himself.

365
00:27:16,765 --> 00:27:20,645
It's also dangerous to let him do as he pleases.

366
00:27:20,645 --> 00:27:23,775
There's nothing bad for me to know about it in advance.

367
00:27:27,235 --> 00:27:28,465
What is this?

368
00:27:28,465 --> 00:27:30,455
Raise your arm.

369
00:27:32,515 --> 00:27:35,435
You said you only jog. Yeah, right.

370
00:27:56,775 --> 00:27:59,955
 It's a charm. Lucky charm. 

371
00:28:00,815 --> 00:28:04,545
 You gave me this on the day I had an interview. 

372
00:28:04,545 --> 00:28:06,965
 Oh, that's right. 

373
00:28:06,965 --> 00:28:08,845
 But you got rejected then. 

374
00:28:08,845 --> 00:28:12,555
 But eventually, I got in, and I'm sitting here now. 

375
00:28:19,065 --> 00:28:21,795
Deputy Editor!

376
00:28:21,795 --> 00:28:24,085
Oh, my God!

377
00:28:25,165 --> 00:28:27,445
What are you doing over there?

378
00:28:41,585 --> 00:28:44,015
But why are you like that?

379
00:28:46,375 --> 00:28:48,605
Did something happen?

380
00:28:51,905 --> 00:28:55,095
- Yes. 
- Why? What is it?

381
00:28:59,235 --> 00:29:02,975
I heard that you're getting a promotional transfer.

382
00:29:02,975 --> 00:29:05,585
Where did you learn a word like that?

383
00:29:05,585 --> 00:29:07,385
Before when I was doing judo,

384
00:29:07,385 --> 00:29:09,545
my seonbaes used to say that when the coaches

385
00:29:09,545 --> 00:29:13,255
or the directors transferred to better positions.

386
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:15,565
I see.

387
00:29:16,655 --> 00:29:20,785
Anyway, who told you that I'm being promoted?

388
00:29:21,725 --> 00:29:25,065
PD Kwon told us.

389
00:29:25,065 --> 00:29:29,915
That you're going to Young Toon as the chief editor.

390
00:29:29,915 --> 00:29:31,955
That it's the talk of the town in the industry right now.

391
00:29:31,955 --> 00:29:33,885
PD Kwon did?

392
00:29:33,885 --> 00:29:35,415
Yes.

393
00:29:36,935 --> 00:29:40,795
But that's not true.

394
00:29:41,865 --> 00:29:45,375
- Sorry?
 - I didn't decide yet.

395
00:29:45,375 --> 00:29:48,505
Of course, I did get the offer.

396
00:29:51,815 --> 00:29:56,515
Then you might still r-reject the o-offer?

397
00:29:56,515 --> 00:29:58,715
Yeah.

398
00:29:58,715 --> 00:30:02,515
Why, do you not want me to go?

399
00:30:02,515 --> 00:30:06,745
Well, this is shameless and selfish of me, but

400
00:30:06,745 --> 00:30:10,315
I don't want you to go, of course.

401
00:30:10,315 --> 00:30:14,705
But everyone is saying that it's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity you can't refuse.

402
00:30:14,705 --> 00:30:18,865
So, I can't really talk to you about it...

403
00:30:26,685 --> 00:30:29,225
Well, it is a good opportunity.

404
00:30:31,075 --> 00:30:34,415
Lots of people covet that position.

405
00:30:35,935 --> 00:30:39,255
But why couldn't you decide yet?

406
00:30:41,935 --> 00:30:44,645
Just because other people want something,

407
00:30:44,645 --> 00:30:48,395
I don't have to want it just like them.

408
00:30:48,395 --> 00:30:54,135
I'm in the process of studying my heart carefully.

409
00:30:55,345 --> 00:30:57,625
Trying to figure out what I really want and

410
00:30:57,625 --> 00:31:01,670
what kind of decision I wouldn't regret later.

 Then, what is a genuine editor? 

446
00:33:15,035 --> 00:33:16,950
 In one word. 

447
00:33:19,965 --> 00:33:22,405
 That's what you have to find out. 

448
00:33:22,405 --> 00:33:23,825
 Oh, me? 

449
00:33:23,825 --> 00:33:25,845
 Me… I see. 

450
00:33:25,845 --> 00:33:31,570
 Starting next month, send me your answer each and every month, you got it?

00:34:06,910 --> 00:34:09,325
Why are you still conflicted?

461
00:34:09,325 --> 00:34:12,195
Where else will you get a better offer than this?

462
00:34:12,195 --> 00:34:14,787
Everyone has a place that suits them.

463
00:34:14,787 --> 00:34:17,377
And everyone is attracted to different terms.

464
00:34:18,715 --> 00:34:21,655
No matter how I think about it,

465
00:34:21,655 --> 00:34:24,235
I think you're a better fit for that position.

466
00:34:24,235 --> 00:34:26,585
Why me of all people?

467
00:34:26,585 --> 00:34:29,345
Because I want to be with you.

468
00:34:35,065 --> 00:34:37,435
I need to learn more from you, Oppa.

469
00:34:37,435 --> 00:34:42,658
Just like how you chose Chief Editor Jang Man Cheol and went to Neon.

470
00:34:42,658 --> 00:34:46,928
I also chose you as my chief editor.

471
00:34:48,895 --> 00:34:51,525
Didn't you ever regret

472
00:34:52,465 --> 00:34:54,965
your decision then?

473
00:34:56,335 --> 00:35:04,535
This might be your last chance to reverse that decision.

474
00:35:18,765 --> 00:35:20,995
 R.I.P. Gu Ae Ri, Sophia 

475
00:35:58,385 --> 00:36:00,945
 Why the heck are you refusing to go? 

476
00:36:00,945 --> 00:36:03,505
 Shouldn't you be thankful that it's Young Toon that you're switching to? 

477
00:36:03,505 --> 00:36:05,055
 Especially under the circumstances? 

478
00:36:05,055 --> 00:36:07,035
Oppa.

479
00:36:07,035 --> 00:36:09,795
Let's think realistically.

480
00:36:10,875 --> 00:36:13,985
I don't care if they trash talk about me.

481
00:36:13,985 --> 00:36:18,825
I just need for us two to be together.

482
00:36:22,485 --> 00:36:24,375
Oppa...

483
00:36:26,085 --> 00:36:28,445
It's all an excuse.

484
00:36:28,445 --> 00:36:30,635
What excuse?

485
00:36:32,055 --> 00:36:38,385
You just chose Chief Editor Jang Man Cheol.

486
00:36:41,245 --> 00:36:43,365
Instead of me.

 Search Result: Seok Ji Hyeong 

488
00:37:50,505 --> 00:37:51,765
Deputy Editor.

489
00:37:51,765 --> 00:37:53,275
Hey.

490
00:37:53,275 --> 00:37:55,995
Did you see the email I sent you yesterday?

491
00:37:55,995 --> 00:37:57,485
Yesterday, I sent the homework,

492
00:37:57,485 --> 00:38:01,345
"What is a webtoon editor?" that you told me to do.

493
00:38:01,345 --> 00:38:04,915
Well, the meaning behind that homework is not about

494
00:38:04,915 --> 00:38:08,408
me checking it, but you doing it every month.

495
00:38:08,408 --> 00:38:10,318
That's true.

496
00:38:13,158 --> 00:38:17,105
Just because I don't check, don't do it half-a**ed or skip on it. Okay?

497
00:38:17,105 --> 00:38:18,275
Of course not.

498
00:38:18,275 --> 00:38:21,998
I always think of that homework as my priority while working.

499
00:38:21,998 --> 00:38:24,078
You're doing well.

500
00:38:30,645 --> 00:38:32,465
One second.

501
00:38:33,345 --> 00:38:34,855
Yes, Artist.

502
00:38:34,855 --> 00:38:36,048
Have you been doing well?

503
00:38:36,048 --> 00:38:39,388
Deputy Editor, are you going to Young Toon by chance?

504
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,124
You are.

505
00:38:43,124 --> 00:38:46,104
You worked that hard to stop me from going to Young Toon.

506
00:38:46,104 --> 00:38:49,694
Now, you're going to be their chief editor by yourself?

507
00:38:49,694 --> 00:38:53,674
Whoa. Isn't this totally a betrayal and a stab in the back?

508
00:38:53,674 --> 00:38:56,834
Come on now. I told you I haven't made up my mind yet.

509
00:38:56,834 --> 00:39:00,314
That is what I had first thought.

510
00:39:00,314 --> 00:39:05,904
But on second thought, it's about time you become a chief editor.

511
00:39:05,904 --> 00:39:08,445
Also, if you become Young Toon's chief editor,

512
00:39:08,445 --> 00:39:11,324
it would be more convenient for me when I move there as well.

513
00:39:11,324 --> 00:39:15,804
So, I thought it wasn't such a bad thing.

514
00:39:15,804 --> 00:39:17,810
Are you going to move to Young Toon?

515
00:39:17,810 --> 00:39:19,560
No.

516
00:39:22,044 --> 00:39:24,594
But you can never be sure about anything in life.

517
00:39:24,594 --> 00:39:27,854
This field is changing so fast these days.

518
00:39:30,544 --> 00:39:32,164
And honestly,

519
00:39:32,164 --> 00:39:36,794
it's a good thing if an ally like you is a chief editor of any platform.

520
00:39:36,794 --> 00:39:38,524
Isn't that true?

521
00:39:42,604 --> 00:39:46,374
Okay, then please contact me right away.

522
00:39:47,344 --> 00:39:48,974
Okay.

What are you peeking at?

527
00:40:09,084 --> 00:40:11,617
Your daughter is just so adorable.

528
00:40:11,617 --> 00:40:13,547
That's my son.

529
00:40:15,554 --> 00:40:17,044
I'm kidding.

530
00:40:17,044 --> 00:40:19,194
She's lovely, right? My Ji Ho.

531
00:40:19,194 --> 00:40:22,594
I'm thinking of debuting her in a girl group later.

532
00:40:26,914 --> 00:40:28,244
Why?

533
00:40:28,244 --> 00:40:30,504
Curious about these files?

534
00:40:32,254 --> 00:40:33,974
I'll show you when you grow up a little more.

535
00:40:33,974 --> 00:40:35,614
You won't understand anything now.

536
00:40:35,614 --> 00:40:37,244
Just get to work.

537
00:40:37,244 --> 00:40:38,944
Okay.

538

 Kwon Yeong Bae, 2022-2023 Expected Artist Data

 2022-2023 Expected Artist Data 

540
00:40:55,904 --> 00:40:58,514
I need to go to the bathroom.

541
00:40:58,514 --> 00:41:01,944
- PD Kwon.  
 - You won't get it but take a look. Look all you want.

542
00:41:01,944 --> 00:41:05,544
And if you have an idea that can help us, then think about that.

543
00:41:05,544 --> 00:41:08,444
This is why my hoobaes fall for me.

544
00:41:17,414 --> 00:41:19,504
Look at this.

545
00:41:27,986 --> 00:41:29,729
See right here.

546
00:41:29,729 --> 00:41:32,099
You can do stuff like this, too.

547
00:41:33,434 --> 00:41:35,654
- Isn't it neat?
 - Whoa, yes.

548
00:41:35,654 --> 00:41:39,944
Lately, I'm deep into applying new effects.

549
00:41:39,944 --> 00:41:41,794
Because I can work in separate layers,

550
00:41:41,794 --> 00:41:46,124
it's so much fun because I can try out different variations.

551
00:41:46,124 --> 00:41:49,834
It's so crazy that there's still more to learn even at this age.

552
00:41:49,834 --> 00:41:54,044
It's hard, but I'm still glad.

553
00:41:54,044 --> 00:41:56,774
You're great, sir.

554
00:41:57,864 --> 00:42:02,174
Anyhow, are you concerned about something?

555
00:42:04,074 --> 00:42:06,744
Do I look that way?

556
00:42:10,524 --> 00:42:12,974
I don't know what the problem is, but

557
00:42:13,584 --> 00:42:18,834
try to separate the layers of your thoughts carefully.

558
00:42:18,834 --> 00:42:22,734
You turn off the layers that are on top and

559
00:42:22,734 --> 00:42:25,524
look at each one separately,

560
00:42:25,524 --> 00:42:29,574
then you can see the true nature of the issue.

561
00:42:37,234 --> 00:42:38,844
I see.

562
00:43:08,064 --> 00:43:10,354
You're by yourself today.

563
00:43:11,614 --> 00:43:14,524
Chief Editor also came alone last night.

564
00:43:15,294 --> 00:43:16,124
I see.

565
00:43:16,124 --> 00:43:19,284
- Please have a good time.
 - Thank you.

566
00:43:28,304 --> 00:43:30,354
 Young Toon CEO 

567
00:43:30,354 --> 00:43:32,434
 Deputy Editor Seok Ji Hyeong, 

568
00:43:32,434 --> 00:43:35,954
 you'll give me an answer by the end of the week, right? 

569
00:43:40,364 --> 00:43:43,564
 Did you see the email I sent you yesterday? 

570
00:43:52,184 --> 00:43:55,754
 On Ma Eum 

571
00:43:56,384 --> 00:43:59,904
 An editor is a webtoon artist's cheer squad. 

572
00:43:59,904 --> 00:44:01,504
 Artist Baek, your drawings... 

573
00:44:01,504 --> 00:44:05,274
 I mean, your comic drawings are not sagging. 

574
00:44:05,274 --> 00:44:08,274
 Yes, so when you are drawing, sir... 

575
00:44:08,274 --> 00:44:10,554
 if being hunched over was the issue, 

576
00:44:10,554 --> 00:44:12,304
 you can adjust the drawing board angle 

577
00:44:12,304 --> 00:44:14,664
 and if you can draw from the frontal view... 

578
00:44:14,664 --> 00:44:18,524
 Then I can draw webtoons that I'm not embarrassed about? 

579
00:44:18,524 --> 00:44:20,454
 Yes, that is right. 

580
00:44:20,454 --> 00:44:23,864
 You must always breathe energy into the artist, telling them that they can do it 

581
00:44:23,864 --> 00:44:26,984
 and also encourage their confidence. 

582
00:44:26,984 --> 00:44:31,584
 An editor is a troubleshooter for webtoon artists. 

583
00:44:31,584 --> 00:44:32,964
 No, we can't suspend! 

584
00:44:32,964 --> 00:44:34,644
 Wh-Where are you right now? 

585
00:44:34,644 --> 00:44:36,884
 I'm on my way to find Artist Na's girlfriend. 

586
00:44:36,884 --> 00:44:37,844
 What? 

587
00:44:37,844 --> 00:44:39,444
 Promise me. 

588
00:44:39,444 --> 00:44:40,704
 Promise! 

589
00:44:40,704 --> 00:44:42,774
 - Great!
 - For the artist to meet the deadline, 

590
00:44:42,774 --> 00:44:46,884
 do whatever you must do. 

591
00:44:46,884 --> 00:44:51,640
 An editor is a webtoon artist's running mate. 

592
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:55,534
 One, two. One, two. 

593
00:44:55,534 --> 00:44:58,504
 You gladly join on the lonely marathon 

594
00:44:58,504 --> 00:45:00,734
 of the artist as another leg and 

595
00:45:00,734 --> 00:45:03,230
 - One, two!
 - finish the race together. 

596
00:45:04,784 --> 00:45:06,454
 Peeve Weapon. 

597
00:45:06,454 --> 00:45:11,150
 Then you are Artist Sin Dae Ryuk? 

598
00:45:12,254 --> 00:45:15,094
 An editor is Columbus. 

599
00:45:15,094 --> 00:45:18,204
 To discover a new continent called "Rookie artist," 

600
00:45:18,204 --> 00:45:21,850
 you willingly embark on long adventures. 

601
00:45:22,904 --> 00:45:24,924
Pretty good.

602
00:45:26,224 --> 00:45:29,854
 An editor is a gardener. 

603
00:45:29,854 --> 00:45:32,724
 Eat well and... 

604
00:45:32,724 --> 00:45:35,494
 sleep well. 

605
00:45:36,754 --> 00:45:38,874
 You trusted me back then. 

606
00:45:38,874 --> 00:45:41,824
 Please trust me one more time. 

607
00:45:42,644 --> 00:45:44,524
 Fighting, Ma Yu Na. 

608
00:45:45,874 --> 00:45:47,844
 I'm sorry. 

609
00:45:47,844 --> 00:45:55,504
 A gardener who looks after and cares for numerous trees and flowers called "Webtoon artists." 

610
00:45:55,504 --> 00:46:00,914
 Sometimes you get pricked by a rose's thorns and get wounded. 

611
00:46:00,914 --> 00:46:07,024
 Sometimes, you can't do anything else but cut off some overgrown branches or grass. 

612
00:46:07,024 --> 00:46:08,914
 On Ma Eum. 

613
00:46:08,914 --> 00:46:10,504
 Think carefully. 

614
00:46:10,504 --> 00:46:15,354
 Without readers, there's no reason for us to exist. 

615
00:46:15,354 --> 00:46:18,154
 Even this department each and everyone. 

616
00:46:18,154 --> 00:46:19,924
 The gardener must 

617
00:46:19,924 --> 00:46:24,214
 care for the trees and flowers responsibly until the very end, 

618
00:46:24,214 --> 00:46:27,724
 so that they can bear the best possible fruits. 

619
00:46:28,744 --> 00:46:35,584
 So that many people will visit the garden and fully enjoy its beauty. 

620
00:46:35,584 --> 00:46:40,944
 Webtoon/Web Novel 

621
00:46:42,994 --> 00:46:48,834

 3. Peeve Weapon, 4. Full Count, 5. Dragon's Dream 

622
00:46:48,834 --> 00:46:50,944
This is my garden.

623
00:47:03,084 --> 00:47:04,804
Ma Eum.

624
00:47:04,804 --> 00:47:06,434
Deputy Editor.

625
00:47:06,434 --> 00:47:09,764
- You're still here?
 - Y-Yes.

626
00:47:13,084 --> 00:47:15,434
You've been diligent with the homework.

627
00:47:15,434 --> 00:47:17,884
You saw it?

628
00:47:17,884 --> 00:47:19,374
You did well.

629
00:47:19,374 --> 00:47:22,754
- You were better than me.
 - Gosh. No way.

630
00:47:22,754 --> 00:47:24,834
I'm serious.

631
00:47:26,344 --> 00:47:28,654
A long time ago,

632
00:47:28,654 --> 00:47:31,884
when Chief Editor gave me that homework for the first time,

633
00:47:31,884 --> 00:47:37,274
I think I gave him maybe about two answers.

634
00:47:55,494 --> 00:47:57,234
I think I'll only be a bother here.

635
00:47:57,234 --> 00:47:58,584
I'll leave first.

636
00:47:58,584 --> 00:48:01,094
No, it's okay.

637
00:48:01,094 --> 00:48:03,554
I'm going. See you tomorrow.

638
00:48:13,374 --> 00:48:15,734
I'll see you tomorrow.

639

642
00:48:49,264 --> 00:48:50,694
Hello.

643
00:48:50,694 --> 00:48:52,524
 It's me. 

644
00:48:53,564 --> 00:48:55,424
Who...

645
00:49:04,354 --> 00:49:07,754
I said let's see next time, Uncle.

646
00:49:07,754 --> 00:49:11,604
Why? So you can change your number and disappear again?

647
00:49:14,304 --> 00:49:16,617
How can you treat a person like a debt collector?

648
00:49:16,617 --> 00:49:18,957
What is it you want?

649
00:49:20,274 --> 00:49:21,444
Chip in on the living expenses.

650
00:49:21,444 --> 00:49:23,574
How long did we even stay at your place?

651
00:49:23,574 --> 00:49:27,974
Honestly, we barely kept ourselves from starving while walking on eggshells.

652
00:49:27,974 --> 00:49:30,254
- Aren't you being too shameless?
 - Hey.

653
00:49:30,254 --> 00:49:31,884
You can't be doing this to me.

654
00:49:31,884 --> 00:49:33,624
While you were staying abroad,

655
00:49:33,624 --> 00:49:36,564
who do you think took care of Ae Ri's funeral?

656
00:49:36,564 --> 00:49:40,414
When your noona died, I was the most sorrowful person.

657
00:49:40,414 --> 00:49:43,764
The one who cried sincere tears? I was the only one.

658
00:49:43,764 --> 00:49:47,164
That's why I came to see you for the last time.

659
00:49:47,924 --> 00:49:52,254
Enjoy your food and don't ever come by my workplace again.

660
00:49:52,254 --> 00:49:55,594
S**t. You ungrateful a**hole.

661
00:49:55,594 --> 00:49:57,550
I worked so hard to raise the two of you,

662
00:49:57,550 --> 00:50:00,130
considering my younger sister, who passed away first.

663
00:50:04,604 --> 00:50:06,944
You took all of my parents' insurance money.

664
00:50:06,944 --> 00:50:08,884
On top of that,

665
00:50:08,884 --> 00:50:12,404
you constantly took my noona's part-time income she made as a student.

666
00:50:12,404 --> 00:50:14,784
You were sorrowful when she died?

667
00:50:14,784 --> 00:50:17,794
You must've gotten angry because your money source died.

668
00:50:22,554 --> 00:50:24,454
 Damso Ox Bone Soup, Blood Sausage, Hot Spicy Meat Stew 

669
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:27,900
Hey, PD Gu. Have you eaten?

670
00:50:27,954 --> 00:50:31,874
Hot Spicy Meat Stew is not for me.

671
00:50:31,874 --> 00:50:33,937
See you later.

672
00:50:38,103 --> 00:50:40,393
Jun Yeong! Hey!

673
00:50:41,331 --> 00:50:43,524
How do you know that person?

674
00:50:43,524 --> 00:50:47,534
He's the one! The one who caused Ae Ri's death.

675
00:51:30,489 --> 00:51:33,222
What brings you all the way here?

676
00:51:33,222 --> 00:51:35,372
Because I decided.

677
00:51:36,901 --> 00:51:39,981
I thought I should give my answer quickly.

678
00:52:02,100 --> 00:52:05,600
What is it? Is something wrong?

679
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:14,100
No. There's nothing special.

680
00:52:33,881 --> 00:52:35,801
Jun Yeong.

681
00:52:35,801 --> 00:52:39,171
We have a sudden company dinner later.

682
00:52:39,171 --> 00:52:41,601
And it's at a premium beef place. Isn't that great?

683
00:52:41,601 --> 00:52:42,601
Yeah.

684
00:52:42,601 --> 00:52:45,081
You don't care for it? A beef place?

685
00:52:45,081 --> 00:52:47,971
- No.
 - Right? You like it, right?

686
00:52:49,101 --> 00:52:50,961
What do you like about it?

687
00:52:50,961 --> 00:52:53,971
Today is Deputy Editor's farewell dinner.

688
00:52:55,601 --> 00:52:57,991
You're so clueless...

689
00:53:07,761 --> 00:53:10,701
I'm going to eat a lot later.

690
00:53:14,151 --> 00:53:16,151
Why are you like this today? It's scary.

691
00:53:16,151 --> 00:53:18,961
Why? What? Why?

692
00:53:18,961 --> 00:53:21,831
PD Kwon, you never join on company dinners.

693
00:53:21,831 --> 00:53:25,201
It's premium beef. Korean beef.

694
00:53:25,201 --> 00:53:28,941
He came because this is Deputy Editor Seok Ji Hyeong's farewell dinner.

695
00:53:28,941 --> 00:53:32,661
Farewell party, my foot. It doesn't even cost the base fee to get there in a cab.

696
00:53:32,661 --> 00:53:33,971
You guys always overreact.

697
00:53:33,971 --> 00:53:34,951
We all know.

698
00:53:34,951 --> 00:53:40,571
Even if you say that, we know that you're saddest about him leaving.

699
00:53:40,571 --> 00:53:43,761
PD Kwon. You're trembling, right?

700
00:53:43,761 --> 00:53:45,691
Because you might be forced to take the deputy editor position.

701
00:53:45,700 --> 00:53:48,600
I already said it. I'm never doing it.

702
00:53:48,621 --> 00:53:49,871
Why not?

703
00:53:49,871 --> 00:53:51,191
I think you'll be good at it.

704
00:53:51,191 --> 00:53:53,921
Am I crazy? That position is a lot of work, a lot of stress,

705
00:53:53,921 --> 00:53:55,501
and the only thing left in the end is meaningless flattery.

706
00:53:55,501 --> 00:53:57,291
You don't even know anything about it.

707
00:53:57,291 --> 00:53:59,401
You still get a raise, though.

708
00:53:59,401 --> 00:54:01,101
You really don't know anything.

709
00:54:01,101 --> 00:54:02,941
That tiny increase.

710
00:54:02,941 --> 00:54:06,481
That's nothing compared to the incentives that he's getting right now.

711
00:54:06,481 --> 00:54:08,601
You know well.

712
00:54:09,548 --> 00:54:13,601
There's probably no way Deputy Editor won't leave, right?

713
00:54:13,601 --> 00:54:15,611
How would I know that?

714
00:54:15,611 --> 00:54:17,481
It would be right for him to go

715
00:54:17,481 --> 00:54:19,951
from his perspective.

716
00:54:24,891 --> 00:54:27,491
Whoa, wh-what's going on? Are you pouring yourself?

717
00:54:27,491 --> 00:54:29,461
Gu Jun Yeong.

718
00:54:29,461 --> 00:54:31,231
Give it to me.

719
00:54:31,231 --> 00:54:34,111
You two now skip the honorifics, huh?

720
00:54:34,871 --> 00:54:36,531
Yes.

721
00:54:39,811 --> 00:54:43,731
On Ma Eum, you're sprinting from the beginning?

722
00:54:44,451 --> 00:54:47,871
She must be upset. He was her first immediate supervisor.

723
00:54:47,871 --> 00:54:51,771
Aigoo, you all love to overreact.

724
00:54:52,941 --> 00:54:54,981
Hyeong, what's this sudden company dinner about?

725
00:54:54,981 --> 00:54:56,461
On top of that, Korean beef?

726
00:54:56,461 --> 00:54:59,321
I just want to feed you some meat before you go.

727
00:54:59,321 --> 00:55:01,431
Hyeong, I have something to tell you.

728
00:55:01,431 --> 00:55:03,661
Tell me there. They're all waiting.

729
00:55:03,661 --> 00:55:04,901
Hurry along.

730
00:55:04,901 --> 00:55:06,121
Th-That's not it.

731
00:55:06,121 --> 00:55:07,471
I'm so full. I ate too much.

732
00:55:07,471 --> 00:55:09,141
- Oh, you're here.
 - Hey.

733
00:55:09,141 --> 00:55:11,521
It's fine. Don't get up.

734
00:55:11,521 --> 00:55:12,721
The main character is here.

735
00:55:12,721 --> 00:55:15,031
What main character?

736
00:55:15,031 --> 00:55:18,101
Don't bother. We all know.

737
00:55:18,101 --> 00:55:19,371
Know what?

738
00:55:19,371 --> 00:55:21,921
About your job change, Deputy Editor.

739
00:55:29,581 --> 00:55:32,981
It seems that everyone knows about my business besides me.

740
00:55:32,981 --> 00:55:34,741
Yes, it's that kind of a gathering.

741
00:55:34,741 --> 00:55:36,201
All right.

742
00:55:36,201 --> 00:55:40,281
Today is, as you all know,

743
00:55:44,851 --> 00:55:48,311
Deputy Editor Seok Ji Hyeong, who has been with us...

744
00:55:49,882 --> 00:55:54,420
through the highs and the lows since Ginger Toon to Neon today,

745
00:55:54,420 --> 00:55:58,359
- will be going to Young Too— 
- W-Wait! Chief Editor, wait.

746
00:55:59,101 --> 00:56:00,931
You want to say it yourself?

747
00:56:00,931 --> 00:56:03,541
Yes. I'll tell them.

748
00:56:12,901 --> 00:56:15,681
- Well, right no—
 - One moment.

749
00:56:17,361 --> 00:56:20,351
- What are you doing?
 - Let me be.

750
00:56:22,191 --> 00:56:24,391
You're scaring me toda—

751
00:56:30,981 --> 00:56:33,081
One grand farewell, please.

752
00:56:40,641 --> 00:56:45,381
I know very well what all of you're thinking right now.

753
00:56:45,381 --> 00:56:49,371
As well as what kind of talk is going around within the team.

754
00:56:49,371 --> 00:56:53,261
- Howeve—
 - I'm so sorry, one moment, please.

755
00:56:53,261 --> 00:56:55,181
I really tried not to cry...

756
00:56:55,181 --> 00:56:57,201
What do I do?

757
00:56:58,051 --> 00:56:59,331
What's wrong with her?

758
00:56:59,331 --> 00:57:01,611
Deputy Editor.

759
00:57:03,381 --> 00:57:06,781
I'll do better! Could you not go anywhere?

760
00:57:06,781 --> 00:57:08,721
What do I do?

761
00:57:10,031 --> 00:57:13,821
Aigoo. I've never seen her drunk.

762
00:57:15,171 --> 00:57:16,271
I'm not going.

763
00:57:16,271 --> 00:57:19,690
Please don't go.

764
00:57:19,690 --> 00:57:22,731
That's what I said. I'm not going.

765
00:57:24,871 --> 00:57:26,571
What?

766
00:57:30,071 --> 00:57:31,971
Don't worry.

767
00:57:31,971 --> 00:57:33,331
Really?

768
00:57:33,331 --> 00:57:35,201
Yeah.

769
00:57:35,201 --> 00:57:37,731
- I decided not to go.
 - Huh?

770
00:57:37,731 --> 00:57:39,751
Wait, are you really?

771
00:57:39,751 --> 00:57:41,951
W-Wait, why?

772
00:57:44,331 --> 00:57:45,821
Are you crazy?

773
00:57:45,821 --> 00:57:48,291
Do you mean it?

774
00:57:48,291 --> 00:57:51,011
Yes. I mean it.

775
00:57:52,111 --> 00:57:55,131
I thought about it through and through.

776
00:57:55,971 --> 00:58:00,611
About the reason why I'm so hesitant to leave this place.

777
00:58:00,611 --> 00:58:04,111
As you said, is it because of an unnecessary sense of obligation?

778
00:58:05,050 --> 00:58:09,920
Or is it some kind of fear about a new challenge?

779
00:58:11,721 --> 00:58:17,241
I constantly looked dep into myself.

780
00:58:18,601 --> 00:58:23,611
However, I just want to...

781
00:58:23,611 --> 00:58:28,631
take responsibility of the new projects that I started here and

782
00:58:30,301 --> 00:58:32,951
the people that I have become acquainted with to the end.

783
00:58:34,071 --> 00:58:39,151
I want to see the trees that I planted and the flower seeds that I sowed,

784
00:58:39,151 --> 00:58:43,140
all grow up well

785
00:58:44,270 --> 00:58:47,330
and bear fruits in this garden called "Neon."

786
00:58:47,331 --> 00:58:49,671
Well, that's too bad.

787
00:58:49,671 --> 00:58:55,061
Your desk might be gone come next year.

788
00:58:55,061 --> 00:58:56,521
What do you mean?

789
00:58:56,521 --> 00:59:01,531
The Neon executives intend to acquire Young Toon.

790
00:59:03,921 --> 00:59:08,621
I think I still have a lot of work to do in Neon.

791
00:59:09,651 --> 00:59:15,471
Also, it seems that I have a friend I need to look after.

792
00:59:16,841 --> 00:59:20,551
Anyhow, stop saying unnecessary stuff now.

793
00:59:20,551 --> 00:59:21,961
Ma Eum, stop crying.

794
00:59:21,961 --> 00:59:24,061
Let's enjoy ourselves and feast on meat.

795
00:59:24,061 --> 00:59:27,451
Okay, okay! Drink, drink.

796
00:59:27,451 --> 00:59:28,791
Shall we have a toast?

797
00:59:28,791 --> 00:59:31,981
Cheers to Deputy Editor Seok Ji Hyeong!

798
00:59:31,981 --> 00:59:33,241
Cheers!

799
00:59:33,241 --> 00:59:34,581
Stop overreacting.

800
00:59:34,581 --> 00:59:38,471
- I love it! Cheers for Deputy Editor Seok Ji Hyeong!
 -  Cheers! 

801
00:59:38,471 --> 00:59:40,131
Hey, Ji Hyeong.

802
00:59:40,131 --> 00:59:42,721
Okay, then w-wait, wait.

803
00:59:45,451 --> 00:59:46,921
Okay, then.

804
00:59:46,921 --> 00:59:49,501
Let's say, "Cheers for the Neon Webtoon Editorial Department."

805
00:59:49,501 --> 00:59:51,331
Sounds good.

806
00:59:51,331 --> 00:59:56,311
- For the Neon Webtoon Editorial Department! 
 - Cheers!

807
00:59:56,311 --> 00:59:58,650
Yes, we're all together again!

808
00:59:59,681 --> 01:00:01,721
Why did we even come?

809
01:00:05,271 --> 01:00:06,941
Thank you, CEO.

810
01:00:06,941 --> 01:00:11,961
You gave me a really good opportunity, but I still fall short of the position.

811
01:00:11,961 --> 01:00:15,151
Deputy Editor Jang Hye Mi will do a good job.

812
01:00:15,151 --> 01:00:16,851
Yes.

813
01:00:19,751 --> 01:00:21,661
Thank you, CEO.

814
01:00:21,661 --> 01:00:23,301
Yes.

815
01:00:33,691 --> 01:00:35,851
Why did you come out?

816
01:00:35,851 --> 01:00:37,981
Deputy Editor.

817
01:00:38,891 --> 01:00:41,801
I want to ask you something.

818
01:00:41,801 --> 01:00:44,571
Sure. What is it?

819
01:00:51,541 --> 01:00:53,621
Do you know this person?

820
01:01:09,251 --> 01:01:11,641
How do you know Ae Ri?

821
01:01:33,390 --> 01:01:40,340


822
01:01:46,730 --> 01:01:53,220
♫   Life doesn't go the way you want. Things happen which you never expected   ♫

823
01:01:53,220 --> 01:01:59,710
♫  When I suddenly lose my footing, grab me.  You know everything.  ♫

824
01:01:59,710 --> 01:02:02,700
♫  I feel alone that. Of all things you should ignore a rough relationship.  ♫

825
01:02:02,700 --> 01:02:05,690
 Today's Webtoon 

826
01:02:05,690 --> 01:02:09,160
 You know Ae Ri we used to work with back in GingerToon days? 

827
01:02:09,160 --> 01:02:11,020
 Did she have any other family members? 

828
01:02:11,020 --> 01:02:16,350
 Now that you moved into a new place, I hope only good things happen for you in this new house. 

829
01:02:16,350 --> 01:02:21,460
 They tossed her bait, saying that they'll hire her as a full-time employee. 

830
01:02:21,460 --> 01:02:25,120
 Excuse me, you've met me before at a webtoon artist's apartment, right? 

831
01:02:25,120 --> 01:02:26,530
 What brings you here to the headquarters? 

832
01:02:26,530 --> 01:02:28,270
 I had some documents to deliver. 

833
01:02:28,270 --> 01:02:33,570
 She was the best person to let us know why we should create webtoons. 

834
01:02:33,570 --> 01:02:38,030
 This person is Jun Yeong's older sister? 

835
01:02:38,030 --> 01:02:41,210
♫  Whoa, whoa, whoa, open your eyes  ♫

836
01:02:41,210 --> 01:02:44,190
♫   Someday you will stand again.  ♫

837
01:02:44,190 --> 01:02:48,370
♫  Whoa, whoa, whoa. Think. I think you will smile brightly.  ♫
