1
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:35,840
 Today's Webtoon 

2
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:50,070


3
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,010
 Spread your arms. 

4
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:17,060
 Episode 5: Number of people needed to sustain one person 

5
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:41,760
Seriously.

6
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,370
What's going on?

7
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,500
What's with all of you?

8
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:56,810
How can a webtoon PD do this to an artist's hand?

9
00:01:56,810 --> 00:02:01,060
Will you be responsible if he can't use his hands for the rest of his life?

10
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:06,670
Don't you know hands are as essential as life for cartoonists?

11
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:08,140
Huh?

12
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:17,980
Isn't he the one who used those precious hands recklessly first?

13
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:19,800
Even to me?

14
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,550
PD Gu.

15
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:23,560
Let's take him to the hospital first.

16
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,030
Okay.

17
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:27,520
Are you all right?

18
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,550
Can you get up?

19
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:31,830
Get up slowly.

20
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:33,390
Okay.

21
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:40,900
You guys!

22
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:44,320
If something even minor is wrong with my hand,

23
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:47,660
I'm going to sue Neon Webtoon!

24
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:49,770
Just wait and see.

25
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:01,010
Are you out of your mind?

26
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:05,260
If something goes wrong with him, you will become a PD who ruined an artist's life!

27
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:06,470
I'm sorry.

28
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:08,270
If he posts comments online,

29
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:12,400
do you know our whole team will be shattered because of you losing your temper

30
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:14,140
PD Kwon.

31
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:16,710
That's enough, enough.

32
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:19,130
Go inside. We have to settle the situation.

33
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:24,100
PD Gu took him to the hospital, so let's wait, PD Kwon, okay?

34
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:26,950
We also have to finish evaluating the pitches as well.

35
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:36,940
I'm sorry. It's all my fault.

36
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:40,770
Let's go inside.

37
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:45,860
 Radiology Team Reception 

38
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:54,780
 Chief Director Heo Kwan Yeong 

39
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:58,360
Yes, Chief Director.

40
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:01,440
Something must've happened at the Webtoon Camp.

41
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:04,980
There are weird comments online.

42
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:07,800
- It's nothing.
  - Really? 

43
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,630
Are you sure?

44
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:14,030
Go slowly, s***!

45
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:15,840
I'm sorry.

46
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:22,810
It looks like they posted it online already.

47
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:30,150
Go see PD Gu and check the status one more time.

48
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:34,070
Contact Du Hui and Yu Mi and ask them to follow up on the situation.

49
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:36,980
We have to be on top of the situation if something happens.

50
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:39,290
This situation can't get bigger.

51
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:40,960
Hyeong,

52
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:46,670
something happened with Chief Director Heo Kwan Yeong, huh?

53
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,350
What if something did happen?

54
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:54,310
Let's try our best to take care of the situation.

55
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:56,870
Since judging is the priority,

56
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:58,940
I'll go in first.

57
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,810
How is he? Is he doing really bad?

58
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:07,590
We are waiting for the test results.

59
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:09,930
- I should've done that!
 - Seriously!

60
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:12,530
- Are you sure you're okay?
- Of course, I'm all right.

61
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:17,470
Hold on, Ma Eum.

62
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:19,510
I'll call you later.

63
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,340
 Gi Yu Mi 

64
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:28,350
 A post came up on SNS and online community about what happened at the Webtoon Camp. 

65
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:31,390
 Check the link and respond accordingly at the site. 

66
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:37,810
 I came to the Neon Webtoon Camp and a PD broke a participant's wrist. LOL. 

67
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:46,440
Are you in a difficult situation because of me?

68
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,840
Oh, no.

69
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,070
It's not because of you.

70
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:52,650
It's my fault that I'm in this difficult situation.

71
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:57,420
I disappointed you in many ways.

72
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,750
I am not disappointed in you, Dae Ryuk.

73
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:11,720
"Full Count."

74
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,720
A story about a high school girls' baseball team.

75
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:16,920
This… Wasn't this really good?

76
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,930
The drawings, setting, and everything?

77
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:20,500
Yes, I liked it too.

78
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,710
It includes the artist's personal experiences,

79
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:24,980
so it has its advantages for a long series.

80
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:26,700
How was it, sir?

81
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:30,580
The storytelling and scene production is fitting for a sports cartoon.

82
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:32,490
It's cool and has a nice flow.

83
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:35,020
I think it'll be good with minor editing.

84
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,240
Artist Gu Seul Ah.

85
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:41,080
As to this artist, her drawings are beautiful, but the storytelling is still a bit...

86
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:43,830
Doesn't it lack some energy in moving the story forward?

87
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:48,500
I think a slow tempo can be a unique character for an artist, so it was okay for me.

88
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:52,340
The drawings are pretty, so it's too good to keep scrolling it down.

89
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:55,270
That's true, but the tempo…

90
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:57,950
I don't think the tempo is intentional on her part.

91
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:01,600
It feels like she's still being controlled by drawings.

92
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:06,660
But the drawings are definitely very unique.

93
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,740
Who is this? Really?

94
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:15,790
The drawings are seriously bad.

95
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:17,770
I couldn't even understand what he was saying while he was pitching.

96
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:21,360
Why was he selected as a participant, to begin with?

97
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,760
Editor-in-Chief Jang?

98
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:27,220
Someone immature in our team strongly insisted.

99
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:29,430
Although drawing is very clumsy,

100
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:33,620
he knows instinctively the method to stage cartoons.

101
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:34,800
Method to stage cartoons?

102
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,210
For example, that scene.

103
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:39,600
He expressed the mental state of being cornered by

104
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:43,860
placing the wall behind the character and a huge monster in front of him.

105
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:46,520
At a slanted low angle,

106
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:50,340
he's expressing a sense of urgency and fear.

107
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:51,740
You are right.

108
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:55,510
Newbie artists typically use childish lines to skip over these scenes.

109
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:56,760
Did he learn production somewhere?

110
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:59,000
He said he never learned cartooning, so—

111
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,210
It's an instinctive technique.

112
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:04,150
The viewpoint, location of the speech bubble, and

113
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:07,330
the composition of the psychological descriptions are all good.

114
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:11,980
In other words, the only thing that's lacking is the drawing skills

115
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:17,550
 It seems like you already have artists you've got your eye on. 

116
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:21,340
 Rather than that, I think you chose artists who are not to your taste. 

117
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:23,920
 You are very picky when it comes to drawings. 

118
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:29,700
 A human being is weak but also that much stronger. 

119
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:33,310
 Do not forget that. 

120
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:44,460
Jun Yeong!

121
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:45,850
What brings you here?

122
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:48,330
It was my fault, so I couldn't just sit around.

123
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:52,320
How is he doing? Is he doing badly?

124
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,770
How about coupling him with a drawing artist?

125
00:08:55,770 --> 00:09:00,310
If we assign a different drawing artist, this vibe will not exist.

126
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:05,280
The attraction behind this cartoon is the rebellious vibe that comes out of the rough drawings.

127
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,640
Cleaning up the drawings slightly may be possible, but

128
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:11,840
having a separate drawing artist will result in a completely different cartoon.

129
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,260
Then what should we do?

130
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:16,690
We can't ask him to go and learn drawing elsewhere.

131
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:18,970
Editor-in-Chief Jang.

132
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:20,870
Yes, sir.

133
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:25,990
How about hiring him as my assistant artist?

134
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:27,800
Are you going to be okay with that?

135
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,350
He's not skilled enough to be an assistant artist.

136
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:33,590
No one is good at everything from the start.

137
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:35,980
That would be really great.

138
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:38,240
If that's okay with you, sir.

139
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,760
Yes...

140
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:45,900
Whoa, you even tricked me!

141
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:48,470
You should be acting and not drawing cartoons!

142
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:51,100
They messed with the wrong person.

143
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,600
I posted online, so

144
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,840
- it should've spread all over the community now.
- Right on!

145
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:57,600
Bang, bang!

146
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,030
Your arm is okay, right?

147
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:07,200
Are you okay?

148
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:15,610
Thank God the injury is not serious.

149
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:17,170
They said he's perfectly fine.

150
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:20,610
- So—
 - I still want to apologize, though.

151
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:22,240
Why?

152
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,930
Since he could've been hurt seriously because of me.

153
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:28,780
My attitude as a PD was wrong too.

154
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:33,230
The reason he did this was that he was emotionally hurt.

155
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:36,120
Gosh! What a relief.

156
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,160
 Neon 

157
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:41,720
There was a problem at the camp. I'm sorry.

158
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:44,380
We are in the process of settling and taking care of things.

159
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:48,590
There was a comment online saying that he will sue the company.

160
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:51,150
We managed to delete that last night.

161
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:53,870
There was some misunderstanding.

162
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:56,760
- Team Leader Jang Man Cheol. 
- Yes?

163
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:59,590
Everyone was skeptical about the Webtoon Camp,

164
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:03,510
but you said it was so important so we gave you the budget.

165
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:05,960
You know that, right?

166
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:08,870
Yes.

167
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:14,030
It looks like everyone here experienced your own limitations

168
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:17,500
and spent a very intense time.

169
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:21,320
What you experienced here is just the beginning.

170
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:24,470
Going forward, you'll run into

171
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:28,820
thousands and tens of thousands of your own limitations.

172
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:30,730
Every time you face that,

173
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:36,800
use the experience of going beyond your limitations here as your foundation,

174
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:41,450
and I wish for you to continually grow.

175
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:45,540
I hope everyone flourishes.

176
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:55,650
Did you talk to Artist Sin Dae Ryuk?

177
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:57,340
About the assistant artist position for Artist Baek Eo Jin?

178
00:11:57,340 --> 00:12:00,670
Yes, but he said he didn't want to be an assistant.

179
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:02,100
Really?

180
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:05,760
I see...

181
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:10,670
If he wants to take the slow and longer path, well,

182
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:12,940
there's nothing we can do.

183
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:15,950
- Okay. I got it.
 - Okay.

184
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:21,800
But still, try to persuade him again.

185
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:25,360
Persuading an artist is one of the roles of a PD.

186
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,800
Okay.

187
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,380
Fighting.

188
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:30,000
Fighting!

189
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:33,130
Sin Dae Ryuk!

190
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,680
Sin Dae Ryuk!

191
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:04,360
Can you reconsider?

192
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,210
What?

193
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:08,060
About being an assistant?

194
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:11,170
Artist Baek Eo Jin is the best cartoonist in our country.

195
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:13,530
He's also a really nice person.

196
00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:18,240
If you learn a lot from Artist Baek and improve your drawings a little more,

197
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:23,130
I can help you publish your series officially and help you in every way I can.

198
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:27,720
Why do you go this far trying to help me?

199
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:33,300
I'm just an aspiring webtoon artist who can't draw.

200
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:37,650
I want to become the first reader of the cartoons you draw.

201
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:44,940
I have been scolded several times for having this mindset as a PD,

202
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:49,240
but despite that, the cartoons that you draw...

203
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:53,200
I want to see them first and reveal them to the world.

204
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:56,930
I will...

205
00:13:56,930 --> 00:13:59,940
I will think about it.

206
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:06,010
All the luck that I have, I want to use it all for you.

207
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,790
Come on! Hi, On people!

208
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:11,840
Hi!

209
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:15,510
Today, I will give you a skincare tip from Nu Ri.

210
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:17,130
You're so diligent.

211
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:18,140
Yes, of course.

212
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:21,370
I take care of my skin this way after I wash my face every day.

213
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:23,820
I see.

214
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:39,290
- Is it good?
- Yeah.

215
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:41,300
- Let me try.
 - Follow your facial line.

216
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:43,330
Then the skin becomes tight.

217
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:45,890
- Wow!
 - You feel it, right?

218
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:48,740
I will be worried if you get prettier, Mom.

219
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:51,640
- Why?
 - I'd be worried.

220
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:54,220
You are so greedy.

221
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:55,490
Dad, Dad...

222
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:56,680
What are you doing?

223
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:59,390
Dad's not here. Don't worry.

224
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:02,500
Good job. Welcome back.

225
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,420
Sit down.

226
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:04,920
Did Dad go back to training again?

227
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,910
He went back after just a few days.

228
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:08,600
Gosh, I'm glad.

229
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:11,490
Aigoo, why am I so tired now that I'm home?

230
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:13,660
On Ma Eum even says she's tired?

231
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:15,700
Well, wonders never cease.

232
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:17,850
You need to restore energy. What do you want for dinner?

233
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:19,480
Chicken stir fry or braised ribs?

234
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,610
- Wait, let me see. 
- Gosh!

235
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:23,030
I want to eat braised ribs!

236
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:25,320
Braised ribs! Braised ribs!

237
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:28,980
I can just eat rice with the side dishes we have.

238
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:31,030
 Hey, take out the ribs. 

239
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,710
 Works by 2022 Neon Webtoon Camp Participants - Read and Vote Here 

240
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:37,680
I am reading this these days. It's really fun.

241
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,800
Really? What is it?

242
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,410
- I know this one. 
- You do?

243
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:43,480
It's a story about a vampire moving to Seoul to find her husband.

244
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,400
It's a baseball webtoon.

245
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,110
The rules aren't that difficult.

246
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:48,630
You will like it right away too.

247
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:50,120
Isn't it so detailed?

248
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:52,380
The story is fun. The idea is fresh.

249
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:57,440
The story seems fun, but the drawings are pretty lousy.

250
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,430
Girls like pretty drawings, so I'll pick this one.

251
00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:02,480
How are the responses to the Webtoon Camp short webtoons?

252
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,720
They're not bad.

253
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:08,250
Lots of comments say they're new and fresh and there are many popular ones.

254
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:10,760
Lots of comments also say many are good enough to spin off as a series.

255
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,510
The reaction to Artist Lee Wu Jin's baseball cartoon is good, right?

256
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:14,130
Yes, that's the best one.

257
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:16,450
See? I knew it.

258
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:17,890
You manage that one.

259
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:20,560
Try to publish it as a series officially as soon as possible.

260
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,390
Deputy Editor,

261
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:23,900
- Gu Jun Yeong and Oh Ma Eum. 
- Yes?

262
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:27,510
You three create an incubating team with the new artists.

263
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:28,330
Okay.

264
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:30,720
For the other PDs, please follow up with at least one project per PD.

265
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,980
Please leave me out.

266
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:34,640
I already have too many webtoons on my plate.

267
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,920
I also have some web novels that I need to remake.

268
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:39,220
Okay, you can be excluded since you are busy.

269
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:42,210
For the remaining PDs, please focus on incubating new artists.

270
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:44,980
It's not an exaggeration to say that our team's future depends on it.

271
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:46,090
Please save me.

272
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:52,250
I claimed that I'd show significant progress this time to Heo Kwan Yeong.

273
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:57,730
♫  Let's smile together  ♫

274
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:13,730
Yes, come in.

275
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:15,600
Have a seat.

276
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:21,090
Did you think about the job?

277
00:17:21,090 --> 00:17:23,530
The bomb disposal team?

278
00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:25,120
Yeah.

279
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:29,460
First of all, I'm curious about the aftermath of the bomb disposal.

280
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:34,670
Is the webtoon team going to be absorbed or consolidated into a different team next year?

281
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:35,980
No.

282
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:40,480
The current webtoon team will vanish.

283
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,770
You know YoungToon, right?

284
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:46,580
They specialize in webtoons, so they are not a big company, but they are number one in the industry.

285
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:48,610
We are planning to acquire that company.

286
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:51,410
Of course, it's not definitive yet.

287
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:55,910
We have to collect data for a merger and acquisition plan

288
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:57,720
and report it to the upper management.

289
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:00,650
Collecting that foundation data...

290
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:02,350
Can you help with that, Gu Ju Yeong?

291
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:05,320
Instead of continuing to invest in the current webtoon service,

292
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:07,890
acquiring a company that's already established well in the business

293
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:12,140
is more efficient and has future potential. That's the point I need to sell.

294
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:15,850
Wasn't the original plan to evaluate the webtoon service team's performance at the end of the year?

295
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:17,270
That was the plan, but

296
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:19,320
It was but it's obvious what the outcome will be.

297
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,860
There's less than a year left.

298
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:24,360
Would there be progress in performance that is so dramatic?

299
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:26,880
But you never know.

300
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,600
They may possibly play with numbers for the KPI (Key Performance Indicator).

301
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,240
To prevent them from playing that game,

302
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:36,530
you can provide me with a separate report. Okay?

303
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:38,030
Yes, sir.

304
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:39,900
But I have one question.

305
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:41,690
Yes?

306
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:46,080
If the data that I collected and analyzed tells

307
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,840
that maintaining the current webtoon team is

308
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:52,530
more profitable for the long term, then what will happen?

309
00:18:57,430 --> 00:19:03,110
What is the percentage of possibility that you'll arrive at that conclusion?

310
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:07,000
On top of that, I have you, Gu Jun Yeong.

311
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:18,000
 What will happen to all the employees if the team vanishes? 

312
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,460
Why?

313
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:24,700
If you are the kind of person drawn by personal attachment, I don't need you.

314
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:58,710
 This is the first time that I was given 24 hours just to draw. 

315
00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:00,650
 I'm not sure when I should take a break. 

316
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:06,250
 My desire is not to draw well, but to draw cartoons. 

317
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:12,030
 Everyone else seems to be very talented, but 

318
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:13,920
 I'm wondering if an ordinary person like me 

319
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:18,220
 is just wasting time here for no reason. 

320
00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:25,010
What are you staring at so seriously?

321
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:27,220
It seems so strange.

322
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,800
What?

323
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,490
That's Unni.

324
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:38,520
Unni is doing some "thinking" these days.

325
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,910
A lot of it too.

326
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:43,070
I wonder if she's sick.

327
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,790
 Short Webtoon Competition 

328
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:56,050
Did everyone think about what we talked about in the meeting?

329
00:20:56,050 --> 00:21:00,510
I... choose the martial arts cartoon.

330
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:02,770
- Martial arts again?
 - I get a gut feeling.

331
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:04,560
If we add slight fantasy,

332
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:07,260
my gut feeling tells me this will be an amazing masterpiece.

333
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:09,630
I never saw your gut feelings being right, not even once.

334
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:11,630
This is that one time.

335
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:13,460
This one is it... this one...

336
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:15,980
That's the 20,000th time hearing that.

337
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:17,900
How about PD Yu Mi?

338
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:20,130
This one. A serial killer story.

339
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:22,510
I have so many people I want to kill in reality,

340
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:25,190
so I want to experience vicarious satisfaction through this work.

341
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:28,650
It's not me, right?

342
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:31,450
Think about it since you have a great instinct.

343
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:34,460
It-It can't be me, either, right?

344
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:37,610
On Ma Eum... How about PD On?

345
00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:41,040
I choose Artist Gu Seul Ah. 
 Short Webtoon Competition: Vampire Family On-the-Move Story 

346
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:45,120
When I met her at the Webtoon Camp, I had a good feeling about her.

347
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,760
And...

348
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:50,580
he didn't get picked for the short webtoon competition,

349
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:53,710
but I also want to manage Artist Sin Dae Ryuk as well.

350
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:55,610
Even Artist Sin Dae Ryuk?

351
00:21:55,610 --> 00:21:58,010
Wow, that's ambitious.

352
00:21:58,010 --> 00:21:59,640
How about persuading him?

353
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,380
I'm in the middle of it.

354
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:03,690
He will do it for sure.

355
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:05,260
For sure.

356
00:22:07,610 --> 00:22:09,300
How about you, PD Gu?

357
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:15,330
Can I even manage a new artist?

358
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:16,790
What?

359
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:23,140
I'm concerned that they'd meet a newbie PD like me and

360
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:26,620
never make a debut after struggling so much.

361
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:37,150
Then let's manage Artist Lee Wu Jin with me.

362
00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:38,700
Okay.

363
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:02,770
Why did you do that?

364
00:23:02,770 --> 00:23:04,480
What?

365
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:08,120
When you said you weren't going to manage new artists.

366
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:10,870
It's exactly what I said.

367
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:12,900
I'm not ready yet.

368
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:16,330
I'm also a clean slate.

369
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:20,130
I'm not the type who jumps into things without preparation.

370
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:24,190
It takes time for me to be well-prepared.

371
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:28,940
But... whether being a webtoon editor

372
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:31,500
is a role that I can perform well in.

373
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,410
I'm not even sure about it.

374
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:38,690
Then... in the end...

375
00:23:38,690 --> 00:23:42,270
are you saying you'll be going to a different team?

376
00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:45,960
No.

377
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:50,740
You don't have to be a webtoon PD editor to contribute to the Webtoon Service Team.

378
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:56,260
I have to find things that I can do well in this team in the future.

379
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:09,400
I'll explain about the webtoon and the front cover.

380
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:12,870
At a glance, you can tell the webtoon and the front cover are different, right?

381
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:16,640
The lines are thinner and delicate. There are more decorations on the cover as well.

382
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:20,230
I will show you my creative process.

383
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:21,710
 2022 Neon Webtoon Camp Winning Selection Notice   
Take a look and...

384
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:24,250
 The work you submitted at 2022 Neon Webtoon Camp has been selected...  
follow me as I draw.

385
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,880
I'm sorry. Sorry.

386
00:25:03,390 --> 00:25:05,550
 Webtoon 

387
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:13,900
 2022 Neon Webtoon Camp Winning Selection 

388
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:18,190
 Lee Wu Jin, Gu Seul Ah, Sa Hyun Jin, Yun Ho Jin 

389
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:36,250
Are these fun?

390
00:25:40,390 --> 00:25:42,620
 PD On Ma Eum 

391
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:57,740
 The number of people needed to sustain a person before he falls apart 

392
00:25:57,740 --> 00:26:00,460
 is only one. One is enough. 

393
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:02,380
 The number of people needed to sustain a person before he falls apart is only one. 

394
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,700
 One is enough. Just like me back then... 

395
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:09,290
 I like this webtoon. 

396
00:26:09,290 --> 00:26:12,820
 If I can be that one person for you, Artist Dae Ryuk 

397
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:15,170
 I would be so happy. 

398
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:45,360
Gu Jun Yeong, you are not as ambitious about work as I thought.

399
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:48,200
- Excuse me? 
 - Or are you overly careful?

400
00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:51,950
Nah, he just has a different style.

401
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:57,120
There are people like Ma Eum who learn by jumping right into things

402
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:00,500
and there are people like Jun Yeong who take charge

403
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:05,270
by taking baby steps carefully and expanding gradually.

404
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:06,230
Is that right?

405
00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:08,610
I don't think Jun Yeong's work style is bad at all.

406
00:27:08,610 --> 00:27:11,250
It's not like he's intentionally avoiding issues because he doesn't want to work.

407
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:14,890
Or are you?

408
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,610
No.

409
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:23,600
Thanks for understanding.

410
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,460
 Artist Sin Dae Ryuk 

411
00:27:34,970 --> 00:27:36,650
Yes, it's me.

412
00:27:36,650 --> 00:27:38,960
Yes, Artist Sin Dae Ryuk.

413
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:45,310
I will do it.

414
00:27:47,170 --> 00:27:51,650
You are talking about the assistant position to Artist Baek, right?

415
00:27:51,650 --> 00:27:53,300
Really?

416
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:57,500
PD On Ma Eum, I will believe in you for once.

417
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:00,700
Because you believed in me too.

418
00:28:03,610 --> 00:28:05,580
I'm glad you came to that conclusion.

419
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:08,570
I will be in touch.

420
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,640
Sir? Use the tablet...

421
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,200
Oh, yes.

422
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,730
The tablet.

423
00:28:53,850 --> 00:28:55,950
The tablet, okay?

424
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,980
Don't be too nervous.

425
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:11,110
They are really nice people.

426
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:12,590
Okay.

427
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:28,600
Dong Hui, teach him step-by-step for now.

428
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,500
It's his first time being an assistant

429
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,850
so I hope everyone helps him out a lot.

430
00:29:32,850 --> 00:29:34,490
Yes, sir.

431
00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:38,180
Nice to meet you. I'm Im Dong Hui. Well...

432
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:40,200
I worked here the longest.

433
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,910
Like a ghost who's stuck in one place.

434
00:29:46,090 --> 00:29:47,850
I'm Gun Gu.

435
00:29:47,850 --> 00:29:50,140
I also joined recently.

436
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:52,280
I ask for your support.

437
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:55,390
What are you asking of me?

438
00:29:55,390 --> 00:29:56,780
What?

439
00:29:58,010 --> 00:30:00,690
I'll thank you in advance for taking care of Artist Sin.

440
00:30:00,690 --> 00:30:03,890
I hope he learns a lot here and makes his debut.

441
00:30:03,890 --> 00:30:06,180
Saying that in front of an aspiring cartoonist who spent the last ten years trying to debut.

442
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:08,220
Isn't that too mean, PD?

443
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:10,980
Gosh, no, I didn't mean it that way. I'm so sorry.

444
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:13,370
Of course, Artist Dong Hui must debut first.

445
00:30:13,370 --> 00:30:15,630
I'm just joking.

446
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:26,700
You are really terrible at drawing.

447
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:29,640
Still, that's the best-case scenario.

448
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:31,360
Drawings improve through practice.

449
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:36,220
Well, storytelling and staging are pretty instinctive.

450
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:40,010
You said you never learned about cartoons?

451
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:44,190
How long did you use this?

452
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:46,090
Does this work properly?

453
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:58,150
Use this for now.

454
00:30:58,150 --> 00:30:59,100
It's okay.

455
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:01,280
I'm not okay with it.

456
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,740
Thank you.

457
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:12,950
Practice drawing circles freehand.

458
00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:16,740
What is freehand?

459
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:21,790
Do it like this.

460
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:27,240
If you know how to draw clean circles, they say drawing skills improve.

461
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,130
Practice…

462
00:31:41,130 --> 00:31:44,260
If you practice, you will improve no matter what.

463
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:46,600
I don't want to draw well.

464
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,530
I want to draw interesting cartoons.

465
00:31:48,530 --> 00:31:49,950
What?

466
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:57,000
Nothing.

467
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,100
I will practice hard.

468
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:02,180
Fighting.

469
00:32:37,290 --> 00:32:39,310
Excuse me, where is the Editorial Department?

470
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:40,790
Go around the left.

471
00:32:40,790 --> 00:32:43,790
Oh, thank you.

472
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:49,650
You didn't have to buy me this.

473
00:32:49,650 --> 00:32:51,040
Enjoy.

474
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,720
Thank you.

475
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,930
Okay.

476
00:32:54,930 --> 00:32:59,130
Then, shall we talk about the manuscript?

477
00:32:59,130 --> 00:33:00,160
Okay.

478
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:02,350
I'm so excited!

479
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:04,270
All right.

480
00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:06,190
First of all, many people said that

481
00:33:06,190 --> 00:33:10,790
the overall mood is very good, and your drawings are pretty.

482
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:15,410
But we also received

483
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:18,360
comments that said you only draw scenes

484
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:20,700
that you want to draw.

485
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:22,620
I see...

486
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:24,380
The scenes are not developed organically

487
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:25,860
and the episodes are

488
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:28,650
stitched together like watching a movie trailer.

489
00:33:28,650 --> 00:33:31,640
 Not organically developed... 

490
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:37,470
And the female protagonist doesn't seem to fit the romantic comedy feel.

491
00:33:37,470 --> 00:33:40,010
It would be nice to make her more exciting.

492
00:33:40,010 --> 00:33:41,830
Then it will liven up the story too.

493
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:45,190
And when the male and female main characters appear for the first time,

494
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:48,730
I think it needs to be more impactful...

495
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:53,070
That's what was said. 
   First round of comments on Artist Gu Seul Ah 

496
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:56,780
Seul Ah?

497
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:00,230
Seul Ah?

498
00:34:00,230 --> 00:34:01,610
Ah, yes.

499
00:34:01,610 --> 00:34:05,080
I'm sorry. It's confusing because there is a lot we are discussing, right?

500
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:08,400
No, I'm sorry.

501
00:34:09,570 --> 00:34:13,000
Can you say it one more time?

502
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:25,620
What are you doing not pressing the button?

503
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:29,190
Hello.

504
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:31,350
Did you have a meeting too?

505
00:34:31,350 --> 00:34:35,920
Yes, Deputy Editor Seok Ji Hyeong reviewed my manuscript.

506
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:39,520
Your feedback must've not been too bad.

507
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:40,820
Well...

508
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:43,140
I expected to hear everything they said.

509
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:46,790
It doesn't require a huge fix so I think some minor revisions will do.

510
00:34:46,790 --> 00:34:49,150
How about you, Seul Ah?

511
00:34:50,370 --> 00:34:55,690
I think I have to change a lot.

512
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:00,830
Let's go.

513
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:51,140
What's this?

514
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:53,120
I missed it.

515
00:36:12,930 --> 00:36:17,800
Then, are you saying you can't follow through with the terms of your contract?

516
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,320
Yes.

517
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:21,980
I want to quit.

518
00:36:24,110 --> 00:36:27,350
I don't think I can keep going.

519
00:36:27,350 --> 00:36:28,850
Okay.

520
00:36:28,850 --> 00:36:31,170
I will do as you wish.

521
00:36:32,750 --> 00:36:35,110
 Stop recording 

522
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:46,170
PD On, did you look at the revised manuscript?

523
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:47,400
Yes.

524
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:51,120
It looks like the overall flow of the scenes is better.

525
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:57,150
But the main character's personality feels like it's not as consistent.

526
00:36:57,150 --> 00:37:01,870
The tone and the manners keep changing so it feels a little unstable, shall I say?

527
00:37:01,870 --> 00:37:03,730
The tone and manner?

528
00:37:03,730 --> 00:37:07,610
What does that mean exactly?

529
00:37:07,610 --> 00:37:10,890
The tone and manners are...

530
00:37:10,890 --> 00:37:17,230
Well, it means the overall tone and the manner of the work keep changing.

531
00:37:17,870 --> 00:37:19,680
Well...

532
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:24,780
could you tell me which scenes or cuts you're referring to specifically?

533
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:28,100
 You were kind of vague last time too 

534
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:31,920
 so I had to think through a lot while revising. 

535
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,730
Right. Oh, my...

536
00:37:33,730 --> 00:37:36,150
Hold on. Specifically speaking...

537
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:37,820
Specifically speaking, then...

538
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:40,000
To explain further...

539
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:44,380
the fifth cut and...

540
00:37:45,850 --> 00:37:47,520
Oh, this...

541
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,740
The prep for this isn't completed yet? 
   Webtoon Development Plan for Web Novel "The Girl's Rule" 

542
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:51,690
I had trouble with the drawing artist in the middle of it.

543
00:37:51,690 --> 00:37:55,360
I will find the new artist right away and start the series.

544
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,820
Who is going to do it?

545
00:37:56,820 --> 00:38:00,210
I'm not sure yet. I will have to find one out of newbies.

546
00:38:00,210 --> 00:38:02,750
Yes, I'm sure you will take care of it, PD Kwon.

547
00:38:02,750 --> 00:38:04,520
I have a dinner meeting. I'll go ahead.

548
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:07,060
- Okay, take care.
 - Bye now.

549
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:11,120
Who will be good?

550
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:14,890
This one seems okay.

551
00:38:14,890 --> 00:38:16,900
Hold on.

552
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:20,950
 Crystal 
 margle@neon.kr 

553
00:38:20,950 --> 00:38:22,880
Crystal?

554
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:26,300
My Crystal. Okay.

555
00:38:29,270 --> 00:38:31,180
PD On.

556
00:38:32,090 --> 00:38:34,290
Bring the tablet.

557
00:38:34,290 --> 00:38:35,780
Okay.

558
00:38:52,790 --> 00:38:55,230
I see...

559
00:38:55,230 --> 00:38:59,110
The character is still weak.

560
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:02,220
And based on the artist's own convenience,

561
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:05,380
she's writing lines just to fit the storytelling.

562
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:07,570
That's right!

563
00:39:07,570 --> 00:39:09,480
Yes, that's right.

564
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:12,170
I should've said it like that earlier.

565
00:39:12,170 --> 00:39:15,650
Is Gu Seul Ah pretty hardworking?

566
00:39:15,650 --> 00:39:16,970
Yes.

567
00:39:16,970 --> 00:39:19,540
She is very diligent and tries really hard.

568
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:22,730
And she tries to listen to my feedback to the point I feel bad for her.

569
00:39:22,730 --> 00:39:24,620
I see.

570
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,660
Those types of people

571
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:32,570
tend to exhaust themselves if they don't see quick results.

572
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:51,770
Gosh. Again, again…

573
00:39:51,770 --> 00:39:53,220
Aren't you getting ready to look for a job?

574
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:56,310
Or prepare for the civil servant exam like your boyfriend.

575
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:59,030
Mom, I don't want to get a job right now.

576
00:39:59,030 --> 00:40:01,860
I want to become a webtoon artist.

577
00:40:02,870 --> 00:40:05,210
Wasn't that just a hobby?

578
00:40:05,210 --> 00:40:06,780
No.

579
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:07,970
I am going to debut as a professional.

580
00:40:07,970 --> 00:40:09,920
You never mentioned this before.

581
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:12,020
I couldn't because you'd be against it.

582
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:13,730
Of course, I am against it.

583
00:40:13,730 --> 00:40:15,920
That's only for geniuses.

584
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:19,540
Do you have that kind of talent?

585
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:22,620
Talent…

586
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:26,300
I might not have it.

587
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:29,790
Even if I don't have the talent, I still want to do it.

588
00:40:29,790 --> 00:40:31,490
Stop rambling nonsense!

589
00:40:31,490 --> 00:40:32,990
Where did you get such a silly idea?

590
00:40:32,990 --> 00:40:35,310
It's not a silly idea!

591
00:40:35,310 --> 00:40:39,250
I'm currently developing with Neon Webtoon.

592
00:40:40,270 --> 00:40:43,960
I'm not sure if I have the talent.

593
00:40:45,090 --> 00:40:47,810
But why do you have to say that?

594
00:40:47,810 --> 00:40:51,030
Why can't you believe in your daughter?

595
00:40:51,030 --> 00:40:56,510
If you don't even believe in me, who will believe in me?

596
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:10,350
 In fact, I want to believe in myself the most. 

597
00:41:10,350 --> 00:41:11,170
Don't cry...

598
00:41:11,170 --> 00:41:14,450
 That I also have a special talent. 

599
00:41:26,530 --> 00:41:28,060
What's wrong?

600
00:41:32,210 --> 00:41:37,320
The new artists I'm managing are the only ones not making progress.

601
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:40,310
I didn't even take on managing new artists.

602
00:41:41,590 --> 00:41:43,410
That's okay.

603
00:41:43,410 --> 00:41:46,180
Objectively speaking, I can't look at a new artist's work

604
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:48,050
and judge what's good or bad.

605
00:41:48,050 --> 00:41:50,570
I don't have enough experience to give feedback.

606
00:41:50,570 --> 00:41:53,930
But you're already doing that.

607
00:41:56,410 --> 00:41:59,740
I don't feel like I'm doing a good job.

608
00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:02,110
Makes me wonder if they worked with a different PD,

609
00:42:02,110 --> 00:42:03,620
they would've revised their work already

610
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:07,800
and would be closer to their debut.

611
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:11,100
My gosh! I can't do this.

612
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:14,070
Can you go somewhere with me?

613
00:42:14,070 --> 00:42:15,540
Right now?

614
00:42:26,370 --> 00:42:28,780
I'll carry this.

615
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:30,080
Yes.

616
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:35,010
Whoa, what is all this?

617
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:37,550
Did we come when you were busy during deadline time?

618
00:42:37,550 --> 00:42:38,810
No, not at all.

619
00:42:38,810 --> 00:42:40,550
We can work hard and eat.

620
00:42:40,550 --> 00:42:42,240
We were getting hungry anyway.

621
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:44,020
Thank you.

622
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:47,230
You must've stopped by to see how Sin Dae Ryuk is doing.

623
00:42:47,230 --> 00:42:48,710
Well...

624
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:52,730
Is he doing well?

625
00:42:52,730 --> 00:42:57,320
So far, there were no major issues.

626
00:42:58,300 --> 00:43:01,470
But he still needs time.

627
00:43:01,470 --> 00:43:04,210
It won't take ten years like me, but

628
00:43:04,210 --> 00:43:07,720
- at least for a few years—
 - I'll debut this year.

629
00:43:11,190 --> 00:43:14,610
If I didn't think I'd debut this year,

630
00:43:14,610 --> 00:43:17,990
I wouldn't have come here as an assistant.

631
00:43:17,990 --> 00:43:20,890
You said that too, PD On.

632
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:28,360
 All the luck that I have, I want to use it all for you, Sin Dae Ryuk. 

633
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:30,740
Right, that's right.

634
00:43:30,740 --> 00:43:34,000
I did, but I didn't mean it had to happen this year.

635
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,170
But to make that possible,

636
00:43:36,170 --> 00:43:38,500
we have to try and work hard together. Right?

637
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:41,850
I don't plan to stay here for a long time.

638
00:43:41,850 --> 00:43:47,710
If I can't debut this year, I'll go back to my old job.

639
00:43:47,710 --> 00:43:51,280
I don't care if I draw cartoons at home alone.

640
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:53,910
Wow, you are very ambitious.

641
00:43:53,910 --> 00:43:57,370
If making a debut was that easy, anyone could've done it.

642
00:43:57,370 --> 00:44:00,190
Because I'm not "anyone."

643
00:44:00,190 --> 00:44:04,340
Then, I must be "anyone" since I've been here for ten years.

644
00:44:04,340 --> 00:44:08,120
If you think like that, it will turn out that way.

645
00:44:10,370 --> 00:44:14,720
If you say that aloud, it'll turn out like that even more.

646
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:17,140
Words have power.

647
00:44:22,670 --> 00:44:25,740
Chicken is good when it's hot, right?

648
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:27,570
It's going to get cold. Let's hurry and eat—

649
00:44:27,570 --> 00:44:29,430
We'll get going now.

650
00:44:29,430 --> 00:44:32,280
We'll be a bother if we stay any longer.

651
00:44:34,330 --> 00:44:36,640
Let's eat this...

652
00:44:38,470 --> 00:44:40,180
That's right.

653
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:43,620
Right. We'll come again next time.

654
00:44:43,620 --> 00:44:46,290
Fighting. Please enjoy.

655
00:44:46,290 --> 00:44:48,430
All right then. Bye now.

656
00:44:48,430 --> 00:44:50,180
Bye.

657
00:45:01,620 --> 00:45:04,950
I bought a lot of chicken on purpose.

658
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:11,110
Ma Eum, you're not good at reading a room.

659
00:45:11,110 --> 00:45:14,520
Gosh, I... I mean, we bought them anyway.

660
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:17,120
It would've been nice to just eat together.

661
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:18,360
That's not what I meant.

662
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:22,130
Bringing up Sin Dae Ryuk's debut in front of Im Dong Hui.

663
00:45:22,930 --> 00:45:26,810
If I were Im Dong Hui, I don't think I'd be all that happy.

664
00:45:27,580 --> 00:45:31,240
- Oh, that's why! 
 - If he gets offended, he might not teach Sin Dae Ryuk very well.

665
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:35,380
Doesn't Sin Dae Ryuk need Im Dong Hui's help anyway?

666
00:45:35,380 --> 00:45:37,400
You're right.

667
00:45:40,220 --> 00:45:41,370
How did you know that?

668
00:45:41,370 --> 00:45:43,840
Didn't you meet Im Dong Hui for the first time today?

669
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:47,520
I could just tell.

670
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:51,720
Ma Eum, you choose to tackle issues through standard tactics

671
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:54,920
but most people are more complex.

672
00:46:02,070 --> 00:46:04,850
Sin Dae Ryuk said that himself?

673
00:46:04,850 --> 00:46:07,210
That he will debut this year?

674
00:46:07,210 --> 00:46:08,620
Yes.

675
00:46:08,620 --> 00:46:11,070
I don't know where his confidence comes from.

676
00:46:11,070 --> 00:46:13,070
Did you ever see his manuscript?

677
00:46:13,070 --> 00:46:15,900
Yes, the first day he came here.

678
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:19,550
- Oh, no. 
 - Sir, when that happens,

679
00:46:19,550 --> 00:46:23,360
press Control-Z, then it will undo.

680
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:26,520
Oh, right. Wow...

681
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:31,300
Even at this age, there are so many things to learn.

682
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:35,660
Sin Dae Ryuk is also in the process of learning.

683
00:46:35,660 --> 00:46:37,020
in the working world.

684
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:41,210
Yes, I do think so, but...

685
00:46:41,210 --> 00:46:44,700
No one ever taught him,

686
00:46:45,630 --> 00:46:48,940
but he already knew how to use cartoon dramaturgy.

687
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:53,830
It may not be having confidence without a reason or just being arrogant.

688
00:46:53,830 --> 00:46:57,080
He's good at everything except drawing.

689
00:46:58,420 --> 00:47:03,990
Even PD On Ma Eum, who discovered him definitely has a good eye.

690
00:47:04,990 --> 00:47:09,070
There are many talented people who never get discovered.

691
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:21,780
 Everything depends on him now. 

692
00:47:46,750 --> 00:47:50,030
Your drawing is much better.

693
00:47:52,570 --> 00:47:56,780
That character is different than the main character, right?

694
00:47:56,780 --> 00:47:58,540
Right.

695
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:03,970
But he looks too similar to the main character so it's hard to tell them apart.

696
00:48:03,970 --> 00:48:09,090
How about changing hairstyles and drawing different clothing styles?

697
00:48:09,090 --> 00:48:14,120
Actually, all the female characters look very similar too.

698
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:16,290
A character can have long hair

699
00:48:16,290 --> 00:48:20,800
or have the hair tied up or a bob like me.

700
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:24,940
Or you can also differentiate through eye shapes and body types.

701
00:48:24,940 --> 00:48:26,110
And one more thing.

702
00:48:26,110 --> 00:48:30,490
This cartoon is in black and white, so character details will be crucial.

703
00:48:30,490 --> 00:48:32,210
When readers first look,

704
00:48:32,210 --> 00:48:37,370
they should be able to recognize intuitively what kind of character this is.

705
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:49,260
Actually, I can't really distinguish people's faces.

706
00:48:50,990 --> 00:48:54,610
I can't read facial expressions, either.

707
00:48:55,930 --> 00:48:58,580
Everyone looks similar to me

708
00:48:58,580 --> 00:49:02,420
so I think I draw them looking similar.

709
00:49:10,260 --> 00:49:11,870
 Happy 

710
00:49:19,020 --> 00:49:20,710
 Funny 

711
00:49:20,710 --> 00:49:22,930
♫  Today is calm in the middle  ♫

712

 Sobbing 

715
00:49:34,010 --> 00:49:37,650
Aigoo!

716
00:49:37,650 --> 00:49:39,320
  
  Don't ask me to do things like this.  

717
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:42,050
♫  I know I know  ♫

718
00:49:42,050 --> 00:49:44,840
So why are you doing this?

719
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:48,280
It might help Sin Dae Ryuk with his character drawings.

720
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:54,410
♫  Baby, that's the way I'll live the other day all non my own  ♫

What's with the uniform?

722
00:49:56,520 --> 00:49:59,590
I thought it would help create diverse characters.

723
00:49:59,590 --> 00:50:01,490
It fits.

724
00:50:01,490 --> 00:50:03,500
Is it okay?

725
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:05,660
Shall we take the photos?

00:50:05,660 --> 00:50:08,630

This must be your first time seeing this.

731
00:50:22,530 --> 00:50:25,490

732

Thank you for your help.

It's your turn now, Jun Yeong.

738
00:50:41,710 --> 00:50:43,890
Sorry?

739
00:50:43,890 --> 00:50:45,520
What?

740
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:47,900
This way. Okay!

741
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:50,240
First of all.

742
00:50:51,810 --> 00:50:53,660
She sure gets a move on things.

743
00:50:53,660 --> 00:50:55,440
We'll start with "Happy."

744
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:56,800
All right.

745
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:58,180
Okay.

746
00:50:58,180 --> 00:50:59,850
More. Bigger.

747

00:51:42,990 --> 00:51:44,450
I must be crazy.

760
00:51:44,450 --> 00:51:46,640
Wake up. Come on.

761
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:48,870
What time is it right now?

762
00:51:51,370 --> 00:51:53,040
 Neon Webtoon 

763
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:55,140
Neon Webtoon?

764
00:51:56,390 --> 00:51:58,810
 Hello, this is PD Kwon Yeong Bae from Neon Webtoon. 

765
00:51:58,810 --> 00:52:02,170
 I am contacting you after seeing your illustration on an online forum. 

766
00:52:05,670 --> 00:52:07,890
Isn't this web novel very popular? 
  The Girl's Rule 

767
00:52:07,890 --> 00:52:11,380
I read in an article that it exceeded 100 million views.

768
00:52:11,380 --> 00:52:13,720
They decided to film a drama also.

769
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:16,880
Before that, Neon will release a webtoon version first.

770
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:20,240
I was wondering if you'd take on the drawings.

771
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:23,140
Your drawings are just perfect for this title.

772
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:26,880
- Me?
 - You can say it's like winning a lottery.

773
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:28,950
For a new artist, you know?

774
00:52:28,950 --> 00:52:33,560
Does... PD On Ma Eum also know about this?

775
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:34,870
On Ma Eum?

776
00:52:34,870 --> 00:52:36,240
Why On Ma Eum?

777
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:39,330
- PD On Ma Eum is my managing PD.
 - What?

778
00:52:39,330 --> 00:52:41,290
Aren't you Artist Crystal?

779
00:52:41,290 --> 00:52:43,640
Gu Seul Ah is my real name.

780
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:46,030
Crystal is my nickname.

781
00:52:46,030 --> 00:52:49,770
Now that you say it, I think I saw you during the camp.

782
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:53,340
How long have you been working with PD On Ma Eum?

783
00:52:53,340 --> 00:52:58,840
Since the Webtoon Camp, so about three months, I think.

784
00:52:59,830 --> 00:53:01,350
I'm still at a content development stage, though.

785
00:53:01,350 --> 00:53:04,600
It's been three months, and you are still at that stage?

786
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:06,590
What a waste of time.

787
00:53:06,590 --> 00:53:10,360
With someone with such talent. Aigoo...

788
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:14,660
- Hold off on the project you're working on with PD On Ma Eum for now. 
 - Excuse me?

789
00:53:14,660 --> 00:53:17,250
It's common to change a managing PD during the debut prep phase.

790
00:53:17,250 --> 00:53:20,740
And this production has been approved for the release of the series.

791
00:53:20,740 --> 00:53:24,730
When the series starts in two months, the drama production will begin accordingly.

792
00:53:24,730 --> 00:53:28,420
You can skip contests and everything else and become a professional cartoonist right away.

793
00:53:28,420 --> 00:53:30,990
Once the series starts, your career will blossom for sure.

794
00:53:30,990 --> 00:53:33,270
Are you going to miss this chance?

795
00:53:33,270 --> 00:53:36,850
She wouldn't be too stunned if I surprised her by stopping by, right?

796
00:53:46,380 --> 00:53:48,620
Is she busy working?

797
00:53:56,500 --> 00:54:00,300
Why is PD Kwon here...

798
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:12,660
What are you saying? Turn over Artist Gu Seul Ah?

799
00:54:12,660 --> 00:54:14,160
I was also shocked.

800
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:17,190
I went to the meeting, and she mentioned On Ma Eum and whatnot.

801
00:54:17,190 --> 00:54:19,070
Did Artist Gu Seul Ah say she would do it?

802
00:54:19,070 --> 00:54:20,590
I told her to think about it for a few days.

803
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:21,820
If she doesn't want to, that's fine.

804
00:54:21,820 --> 00:54:23,890
There are plenty of artists besides her.

805
00:54:23,890 --> 00:54:26,280
What do you mean, plenty?

806
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:28,480
How can you think like that and ask me to turn her over to you?

807
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:30,080
How about you?

808
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:33,230
When will you debut Artist Gu Seul Ah?

809
00:54:33,230 --> 00:54:37,470
What if she continues revising indefinitely and misses her career opportunity?

810
00:54:37,470 --> 00:54:40,860
Are you confident she can debut with the project you're working on together?

811
00:54:42,190 --> 00:54:44,490
You might not care since you still get paid.

812
00:54:44,490 --> 00:54:48,710
It has nothing to do with you, even if an aspiring webtoon artist is struggling to make ends meet.

813
00:54:48,710 --> 00:54:52,260
What if she's dragged on by hope for a debut and ruins her life by missing her employment opportunity?

814
00:54:52,260 --> 00:54:53,620
What will you do then?

815
00:54:53,620 --> 00:54:57,720
Could someone like you be responsible for that person's life? Huh?

816
00:55:08,670 --> 00:55:11,300
 It's the right path for Artist Gu Seul Ah. 

817
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:15,770
 If you really care about Artist Gu Seul Ah, 

818
00:55:15,770 --> 00:55:19,350
 stop being clingy and let her go. 

819
00:55:30,830 --> 00:55:33,460
Hey, PD On Ma Eum.

820
00:55:37,110 --> 00:55:39,020
Thank you.

821
00:55:48,990 --> 00:55:52,030
What's the right thing for me to do?

822
00:56:01,130 --> 00:56:07,740
For now, Artist Gu Seul Ah's opinion is more important.

823
00:56:19,630 --> 00:56:21,320
Artist Gu?

824
00:56:23,720 --> 00:56:25,870
This is your present.

825
00:56:27,860 --> 00:56:30,810
Revision work is really tough, huh?

826
00:56:30,810 --> 00:56:32,820
Yes, somewhat.

827
00:56:32,820 --> 00:56:35,260
It's not easy.

828
00:56:36,930 --> 00:56:40,450
You also have other concerns, right?

829
00:56:40,450 --> 00:56:42,140
Pardon?

830
00:56:42,140 --> 00:56:45,070
I heard from PD Kwon Yeong Bae.

831
00:56:53,060 --> 00:56:55,890
PD On Ma Eum, you always

832
00:56:55,890 --> 00:56:59,730
said encouraging and comforting words to me,

833
00:56:59,730 --> 00:57:02,510
so I was able to come this far.

834
00:57:04,580 --> 00:57:08,260
If you say "this far"?

835
00:57:08,260 --> 00:57:13,810
Would it be okay if I accept PD Kwon Yeong Bae's offer?

836
00:57:21,450 --> 00:57:24,430
You are even pointing fingers at me?

837
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:27,800
I want to be like you, Deputy Editor.

838
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:30,600
Me? Why?

839
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:36,200
The artist you are managing, Artist Lee Wu Jin will be debuting soon, but...

840
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:38,950
Artist Gu Seul Ah too,

841
00:57:38,950 --> 00:57:43,780
if she met a PD who is as competent as you,

842
00:57:43,780 --> 00:57:48,070
she would've made her debut much sooner.

843
00:57:49,570 --> 00:57:51,280
Hey, hey.

844
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:55,010
I didn't always succeed in the artists' debut.

845
00:57:55,010 --> 00:57:58,340
Because I also lack in many ways,

846
00:57:58,340 --> 00:58:01,620
there are tons of artists who couldn't bring their talent to fruition.

847
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:05,400
- Really?
 - Yeah!

848
00:58:07,750 --> 00:58:13,050
It feels like you got dumped by a lover, right?

849
00:58:13,050 --> 00:58:17,660
N-N-No. I think it hurts more than when I got dumped.

850
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:20,140
I see. You'll keep getting dumped going forward.

851
00:58:20,140 --> 00:58:21,150
What?

852
00:58:21,150 --> 00:58:25,070
Even if you get dumped 100 times, our job is trying for the 101st time.

853
00:58:25,070 --> 00:58:28,690
Don't despair over getting dumped once.

854
00:58:31,610 --> 00:58:37,540
And the person who dumped you can come back to you later.

855
00:58:37,540 --> 00:58:39,420
You or Artist Gu Seul Ah

856
00:58:39,420 --> 00:58:43,730
can grow more and meet again as a team later.

857
00:58:43,730 --> 00:58:46,230
Isn't that more awesome?

858
00:58:51,370 --> 00:58:53,250
That is awesome.

859
00:58:59,930 --> 00:59:04,480
 For everyone, there is such a thing as optimum timing. 

860
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:08,470
 It's just not that timing right now. 

861
00:59:09,830 --> 00:59:14,410
 Until that time comes, try to grow as much as you can. 

862
00:59:14,410 --> 00:59:19,550
 So that you can really be helpful to Artist Gu Seul Ah then. 

863
00:59:34,230 --> 00:59:35,900
Dad!

864
00:59:47,530 --> 00:59:49,870
Why are you home so late?

865
00:59:50,790 --> 00:59:52,560
Honey!

866
00:59:53,500 --> 00:59:56,500
Come in. The ramen is almost ready.

867
00:59:57,630 --> 00:59:59,350
Why cook ramen at this hour?

868
00:59:59,350 --> 01:00:00,740
What?

869
01:00:02,020 --> 01:00:03,390
Nu Ri wants late night snack.

870
01:00:03,390 --> 01:00:06,030
The ramen is getting mushy. Come in quick. Hurry.

871
01:00:06,030 --> 01:00:08,020
It's getting mushy.

872
01:00:08,020 --> 01:00:09,260
Let's go in.

873
01:00:09,260 --> 01:00:10,870
Okay.

874
01:00:15,410 --> 01:00:17,050
- Hey!
 - When did Dad come home?

875
01:00:17,050 --> 01:00:19,380
Earlier. Be careful!

876
01:00:19,380 --> 01:00:22,400
Why eat ramen at this hour? It's fattening.

877
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:24,230
That's what I'm saying.

878
01:00:24,230 --> 01:00:25,890
What?

879
01:00:26,940 --> 01:00:29,700
I gave it to Nu Ri in her room because you might gain weight.

880
01:00:29,700 --> 01:00:32,540
Geez, are you teasing me?

881
01:00:32,540 --> 01:00:35,570
But I don't even smell ramen.

882
01:00:37,180 --> 01:00:40,190
That's what I'm saying. I was just joking.

883
01:00:40,190 --> 01:00:42,380
To make you laugh.

884
01:00:49,450 --> 01:00:51,520
What the heck? I am craving ramen now.

885
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:54,340
Hey Nu Ri, do you want ramen?

886
01:00:55,940 --> 01:00:58,350
Cook one more.

887
01:01:00,080 --> 01:01:02,050
Go in!

888
01:01:03,110 --> 01:01:05,660
Should I crack an egg?

889
01:01:05,660 --> 01:01:07,700
Sure. Okay.

890
01:01:19,980 --> 01:01:23,360
 Neon, On Ma Eum 

891
01:01:25,690 --> 01:01:28,700
I've waited a long time, you know.

892
01:01:29,930 --> 01:01:31,370
Wh-What?

893
01:01:31,370 --> 01:01:35,220
You doing this isn't helpful to Ma Eum.

894
01:02:09,550 --> 01:02:11,630
 Judo Stadium 

895
01:02:11,630 --> 01:02:12,770
 The Pride of Juwon City, On Ma Eum! National Athlete, Go, Go, Go! 

896
01:02:12,770 --> 01:02:15,350
 The national judo competition of 2021 

897
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:20,500
 and the first preliminary for 2022 national athlete selection will now begin. 

898
01:02:28,460 --> 01:02:29,910
 On Ma Eum, fighting! 

899
01:02:29,910 --> 01:02:31,610
 On Ma Eum, fighting! 

900
01:02:31,610 --> 01:02:33,530
 Fighting! 

901
01:02:42,190 --> 01:02:44,330
 Judges 

902
01:02:45,300 --> 01:02:47,840
 On Ma Eum, fighting! 

903
01:02:51,640 --> 01:02:53,220
 Ready! 

904
01:03:10,690 --> 01:03:12,260
 Turn, turn! 

905
01:03:12,260 --> 01:03:13,810
 Turn! 

906
01:03:16,750 --> 01:03:18,400
 On Ma Eum, fighting! 

907
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:20,240
 Go! 

908
01:03:24,230 --> 01:03:25,820
 Point! 

909
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:42,100
 Ma Eum, wake up! 

910
01:03:44,190 --> 01:03:45,860
 You did it! You did it! 

911
01:03:45,860 --> 01:03:47,540
 Okay! 

912
01:03:53,460 --> 01:03:54,950
 Halt! 

913
01:03:57,730 --> 01:04:00,210
 Maintain your composure! Take her down! 

914
01:04:00,210 --> 01:04:02,310
 Why pull them apart already? 

915
01:04:14,150 --> 01:04:16,710
 It must be a lppon* or nothing.  
(One full point in judo.)

916
01:04:26,250 --> 01:04:29,070
 - She got her! She got her!
- Right on! 

917
01:04:35,150 --> 01:04:36,640
 Point! 

918
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:42,900
 Fighting! 

919
01:06:07,270 --> 01:06:09,490
You came in early, Jun Yeong.

920
01:06:09,490 --> 01:06:11,230
Did you cry?

921
01:06:11,230 --> 01:06:12,030
What?

922
01:06:12,030 --> 01:06:14,860
Your face looks like you cried.

923
01:06:15,470 --> 01:06:17,550
Did something happen?

924
01:06:17,550 --> 01:06:20,270
My face must be swollen because of the ramen I ate last night.

925
01:06:20,270 --> 01:06:23,040
Oh, gosh. Geez...

926
01:06:24,250 --> 01:06:26,680
- Good morning! 
- Hey.

927
01:06:26,680 --> 01:06:28,520
Good morning.

928
01:06:28,520 --> 01:06:29,730
Hello.

929
01:06:29,730 --> 01:06:32,460
Did you eat ramen last night before bed, On Ma Eum?

930
01:06:33,890 --> 01:06:35,740
Yes, sir.

931
01:06:36,500 --> 01:06:41,020
I heard Artist Gu Seul Ah decided to work with PD Kwon.

932
01:06:41,020 --> 01:06:43,510
They are having a meeting over there.

933
01:06:50,460 --> 01:06:53,570
Ma Eum, are you okay?

934
01:06:53,570 --> 01:06:54,950
Of course.

935
01:06:54,950 --> 01:06:58,290
It's more important that Artist Gu Seul Ah does well.

936
01:07:06,820 --> 01:07:09,730
- Take care.
 - Thank you.

937
01:07:27,550 --> 01:07:29,920
I just finished signing.

938
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:32,240
You know that each and every one of the new artists

939
01:07:32,240 --> 01:07:36,590
are very precious assets to us, right?

940
01:07:36,590 --> 01:07:39,060
Where did that come from?

941
01:07:42,850 --> 01:07:45,420
To Artist Gu Seul Ah,

942
01:07:47,010 --> 01:07:50,190
I hope your nickname doesn't apply.

943
01:07:50,190 --> 01:07:51,870
What's my nickname?

944
01:07:51,870 --> 01:07:54,310
New artists' grave.

945
01:07:55,030 --> 01:07:59,240
Hey, that's what weak and failed artists who quit and ran off falsely called me.

946
01:07:59,240 --> 01:08:02,870
Shouldn't this company call me by a better nickname?

947
01:08:02,870 --> 01:08:05,940
Hands of Midas.

948
01:08:05,940 --> 01:08:07,720
Don't you think?

949
01:08:27,540 --> 01:08:29,630
 Are you coming home late again today? 

950
01:08:31,730 --> 01:08:36,670
 Everyone has at least one beautiful scene in their lifetime. 

951
01:08:37,630 --> 01:08:39,500
 All right! 

952
01:08:40,160 --> 01:08:46,340
 Even if you fall and twist a bit, it's good as long as you have fun. 

953
01:08:46,340 --> 01:08:51,140
 But this time, let's ride together with me slowly, okay? 

954
01:08:51,140 --> 01:08:53,130
 I don't want my daughter to get hurt. 

955
01:08:53,130 --> 01:08:54,530
 Okay. 

956
01:08:54,530 --> 01:08:57,270
 All right. Spread your arms. I will hold you. 

957
01:08:57,270 --> 01:08:59,090
 All right! 

958
01:08:59,090 --> 01:09:00,390
 Let's go. Right foot first. 

959
01:09:00,390 --> 01:09:01,630
 Okay, look ahead. 

960
01:09:01,630 --> 01:09:03,660
 Okay, right foot first. Let's go. 

961
01:09:03,660 --> 01:09:05,360
 One, two... 

962
01:09:05,360 --> 01:09:07,200
 One, two... 

963
01:09:07,200 --> 01:09:09,690
 One, two... 

964
01:09:15,590 --> 01:09:18,260
 Before there was judo between us, 

965
01:09:18,260 --> 01:09:24,410
 that was the last time Dad saw my failures as part of the growing process and laugh. 

966
01:09:25,080 --> 01:09:29,330
 The moment when my mere attempt was seen as lovely. 

967
01:09:29,330 --> 01:09:34,690
 The memory of encouragement for whatever choice I had made. 

968
01:09:39,030 --> 01:09:41,440
 Does Dad know? 

969
01:09:41,440 --> 01:09:48,060
 How much those memories helped me to become an honest and confident person. 

970
01:09:49,390 --> 01:09:51,150
You came?

971
01:09:51,150 --> 01:09:52,990
What's up, huh?

972
01:09:52,990 --> 01:09:56,700
I can't believe you asked me to come to the judo gym first.

973
01:09:56,700 --> 01:09:58,840
Here you go.

974
01:10:14,210 --> 01:10:17,190
♫  Where am I?  ♫

975
01:10:17,190 --> 01:10:22,010
♫  I am lost in my wounded pride  ♫

976
01:10:22,010 --> 01:10:26,730
♫  Having deleted all the tough steps  ♫

977
01:10:26,730 --> 01:10:28,860
♫  I have a new dream  ♫

978
01:10:28,860 --> 01:10:31,210
♫  I'm looking for the lost me  ♫

979
01:10:31,210 --> 01:10:34,450
♫  Once more again take a trip  ♫

980
01:10:34,450 --> 01:10:38,280
♫  At the moment the darkness clears  ♫

981
01:10:38,280 --> 01:10:44,280
♫  In the warm wind full of sunshine  ♫

982
01:10:44,280 --> 01:10:49,200
♫  For myself, I will open the wings which were folded  ♫

983
01:10:49,200 --> 01:10:52,640
♫  Higher, get up higher  ♫

984
01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:57,530
♫  Fly, soar, fly in the sky  ♫

985
01:10:57,530 --> 01:11:02,200
♫  Stretch your hands and reach for the light  ♫

986
01:11:02,200 --> 01:11:07,050
♫  Will you take me with you?  ♫

987
01:11:07,050 --> 01:11:12,040
♫  Follow the dispersing light  ♫

988
01:11:12,040 --> 01:11:14,600
♫  I fly  ♫

989
01:11:16,850 --> 01:11:18,800
♫  I fly  ♫

990
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:22,120
Wow, you still kept it up.

991
01:11:23,260 --> 01:11:25,870
Because I like it.

992
01:11:25,870 --> 01:11:27,410
Still.

993
01:11:27,410 --> 01:11:29,000
Let's go!

994
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:30,450
All right!

995
01:11:30,450 --> 01:11:33,250
Let's start over together.

996
01:11:33,250 --> 01:11:36,600
I got a job, Dad.

997
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:39,130
It's already been a few months.

998
01:11:46,510 --> 01:11:47,970
What are you saying?

999
01:11:47,970 --> 01:11:50,320
Sorry for telling you late.

1000
01:11:52,430 --> 01:11:54,210
Hey, Ma Eum.

1001
01:11:55,060 --> 01:11:56,320
Hey.

1002
01:11:56,320 --> 01:11:59,010
You knew how long I'd been waiting for you.

1003
01:11:59,010 --> 01:12:02,130
You knew how I felt while waiting for you!

1004
01:12:02,130 --> 01:12:03,640
Hey!

1005
01:12:03,640 --> 01:12:07,100
Is that it? Just telling me you got a job?

1006
01:12:08,080 --> 01:12:10,230
I couldn't tell you because I knew how you felt.

1007
01:12:10,230 --> 01:12:13,070
I mean, injuries happen all the time. That's nothing.

1008
01:12:13,070 --> 01:12:15,210
That wasn't even a serious injury.

1009
01:12:15,210 --> 01:12:18,220
That was nothing compared to all the things you endured in the past.

1010
01:12:18,220 --> 01:12:20,310
If you give up like this,

1011
01:12:21,670 --> 01:12:23,630
you'll regret it your whole life.

1012
01:12:23,630 --> 01:12:26,140
I made a choice, Dad. I didn't give up.

1013
01:12:26,140 --> 01:12:28,810
- This is giving up!
 - Why is this giving up?

1014
01:12:28,810 --> 01:12:32,040
A dream of becoming an Olympic gold medalist?

1015
01:12:32,040 --> 01:12:35,650
It would've been nice to fulfill that dream. I would've shined.

1016
01:12:38,230 --> 01:12:40,880
I'm sorry I couldn't do that, Dad.

1017
01:12:42,230 --> 01:12:47,020
But I don't want my life to be a failure just because I couldn't fulfill it.

1018
01:12:47,020 --> 01:12:51,270
I don't think my life becomes a success just because I fulfill it.

1019
01:12:51,270 --> 01:12:55,660
Whether I fulfill it or not, that was just my precious dream

1020
01:12:55,660 --> 01:12:59,300
and I have a new dream now.

1021
01:13:04,410 --> 01:13:06,950
My life is not a failure.

1022
01:13:06,950 --> 01:13:10,250
I just want to live my life as someone who can do anything.

1023
01:13:10,250 --> 01:13:12,480
I...

1024
01:13:12,480 --> 01:13:17,160
regret the fact that I couldn't make it to the Olympics all my life.

1025
01:13:18,900 --> 01:13:21,410
But that opportunity

1026
01:13:23,210 --> 01:13:25,590
is yours.

1027
01:13:29,650 --> 01:13:31,380
No.

1028
01:13:32,360 --> 01:13:34,310
No, Dad.

1029
01:13:36,670 --> 01:13:38,780
How tall are you, Dad?

1030
01:13:40,570 --> 01:13:42,730
How tall are you!

1031
01:13:44,240 --> 01:13:46,640
I'm 164cm.

1032
01:13:47,360 --> 01:13:48,660
How much do you weigh?

1033
01:13:48,660 --> 01:13:50,870
I weigh 51kg.

1034
01:13:51,930 --> 01:13:55,420
See? You and I are different people.

1035
01:13:55,420 --> 01:13:59,020
We have different emotions and make different choices.

1036
01:13:59,020 --> 01:14:02,910
Things that mean nothing to you could mean something enormous to me.

1037
01:14:02,910 --> 01:14:07,600
Something that's small to you could mean so much to me.

1038
01:14:10,210 --> 01:14:13,880
I chose judo because I loved judo. That's it.

1039
01:14:13,880 --> 01:14:15,600
Forget it...

1040
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:18,400
On Ma Eum.

1041
01:14:23,810 --> 01:14:26,760
It's okay if you think I failed.

1042
01:14:29,850 --> 01:14:32,500
I'm fine, even if you think I gave up.

1043
01:14:36,370 --> 01:14:41,090
But Dad! This is still my life as is.

1044
01:14:42,810 --> 01:14:44,870
I have to go through it,

1045
01:14:46,240 --> 01:14:48,150
realize...

1046
01:14:49,560 --> 01:14:52,310
and handle my own life.

1047
01:14:53,330 --> 01:15:03,370


1048
01:15:04,690 --> 01:15:07,220
♫  How is your day?  ♫

1049
01:15:07,220 --> 01:15:09,820
♫  How is your heart?  ♫

1050
01:15:09,820 --> 01:15:15,160
♫  Even though the day was intense the night shines  ♫

1051
01:15:15,160 --> 01:15:17,740
♫  Everyday is my birthday  ♫

1052
01:15:17,740 --> 01:15:20,400
♫  I am like awkward kid  ♫

1053
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:24,480
♫  Everything feels new as though I were reborn.  ♫

1054
01:15:24,480 --> 01:15:27,150
♫  The little whisper of wind  ♫

1055
01:15:27,150 --> 01:15:30,110
♫  and the warmth of the blazing sun  ♫

1056
01:15:30,110 --> 01:15:33,130
♫  greeted tired me saying "great job."  ♫

1057
01:15:33,130 --> 01:15:36,390
 Today's Webtoon 

1058
01:15:36,390 --> 01:15:37,260
 Notorious? 

1059
01:15:37,260 --> 01:15:39,420
 Anyway, that's been decided. 

1060
01:15:39,420 --> 01:15:41,810
 So please hurry since deadline remains the same. 

1061
01:15:41,810 --> 01:15:43,850
 Our presence on the homepage... 

1062
01:15:43,850 --> 01:15:45,380
 We must somehow get it back. 

1063
01:15:45,380 --> 01:15:48,400
 You need to speed it up a bit. 

1064
01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:49,860
 It's done now. 

1065
01:15:49,860 --> 01:15:51,020
 It's all finished. 

1066
01:15:51,020 --> 01:15:54,370
 Something I've never seen before came out of him at that moment. 

1067
01:15:54,370 --> 01:15:55,860
 - Artist!
 - What's wrong with my Seul Ah? 

1068
01:15:55,860 --> 01:15:56,890
 Is this 911? 

1069
01:15:56,890 --> 01:15:58,430
 Did you email our team file to your personal email? 

1070
01:15:58,430 --> 01:16:00,340
 They contacted me. 

1071
01:16:00,340 --> 01:16:02,900
 Newbie artists are not a product to be used or a tool. 

1072
01:16:02,900 --> 01:16:04,630
 Are you telling me how to do my job? 

1073
01:16:04,630 --> 01:16:06,590
 Don't cross the line. 

1074
01:16:06,590 --> 01:16:09,930
♫  A night dreaming a dream  ♫

1075
01:16:10,850 --> 01:16:14,300
♫  which cheers for your heart  ♫
