1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:07,980


2
00:00:31,073 --> 00:00:33,960
 Today's Webtoon 

3
00:00:42,919 --> 00:00:47,458
 Episode 14: The stars are shining for you 

4
00:00:51,751 --> 00:00:54,387
Don't schedule everything around your schedule.

5
00:00:54,387 --> 00:00:56,633
But you don't schedule things on Sundays.

6
00:00:56,633 --> 00:00:59,113
You're not going to be here.

7
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:04,263
Who are you?

8
00:01:04,263 --> 00:01:05,998
Me?

9
00:01:05,998 --> 00:01:09,758
I'm Artist Sin Dae Ryuk's mom.

10
00:01:12,635 --> 00:01:14,890
Did you say you are Artist Sin Dae Ryuk's...

11
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:17,660
 Stay still! 
 - Don't do that! I don't want to! 

12
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:20,150
... mother?

13
00:01:22,245 --> 00:01:25,385
Your office is a bit

14
00:01:25,385 --> 00:01:30,085
too simple, compared to the Neon brand, right?

15
00:01:30,085 --> 00:01:33,855
Mother, shall we have a word over there?

16
00:01:35,065 --> 00:01:38,065
Who is this handsome person?

17
00:01:38,075 --> 00:01:40,855
I'm PD Seok Ji Hyeong.

18
00:01:40,855 --> 00:01:43,285
He's the Deputy Editor.

19
00:01:44,455 --> 00:01:47,925
Oh, you're a higher-up person. Right?

20
00:01:47,925 --> 00:01:50,575
I'm not really a high-up. Just another PD.

21
00:01:50,575 --> 00:01:53,685
Let me bring you to the conference room first. PD On, please.

22
00:01:53,685 --> 00:01:56,245
Okay, this way, please.

23
00:02:07,125 --> 00:02:09,985
- On Ma Eum?
 - Yes...

24
00:02:11,915 --> 00:02:14,705
- Seok Ji Hyeong?
 - Yes.

25
00:02:16,745 --> 00:02:20,845
It's the right etiquette to memorize the names quickly.

26
00:02:22,455 --> 00:02:24,565
My name is Gyeong Ja.

27
00:02:24,565 --> 00:02:26,805
Kang Gyeong Ja.

28
00:02:27,895 --> 00:02:29,535
Mother, Kang Gyeong Ja, okay.

29
00:02:29,535 --> 00:02:31,110
By the way, what brings you here today?

30
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:33,110
- I don't like it.
 - Sorry?

31
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:35,155
Please address me as Ms. Gyeong Ja.

32
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:38,255
O-Okay, M-Ms. Gyeong Ja or...

33
00:02:38,255 --> 00:02:40,725
M-Mrs. Gyeong Ja?

34
00:02:42,314 --> 00:02:46,295
It's just that my Dae Ryuk won't respond to my calls.

35
00:02:46,295 --> 00:02:51,475
So I came here to Neon to see if I'd be able to see him.

36
00:02:51,475 --> 00:02:53,550
Where does my Dae Ryuk live?

37
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:56,335
Well, that's personal information, so

38
00:02:56,335 --> 00:02:58,025
I'm sorry.

39
00:02:58,025 --> 00:03:00,123
What do you mean by "personal information"?

40
00:03:00,123 --> 00:03:04,283
It's just a mother wanting to see her son.

41
00:03:05,175 --> 00:03:08,825
Do I look like a weird person to you, PD On Ma Eum?

42
00:03:08,825 --> 00:03:10,815
N-No...

43
00:03:11,685 --> 00:03:16,965
it's just that Artist Sin needs more time before you two can meet.

44
00:03:16,965 --> 00:03:19,135
I'll try my best to arrange a meeting for yo-

45
00:03:19,135 --> 00:03:20,805
I don't have time for that!

46
00:03:20,805 --> 00:03:24,455
Do you even know how many years I've been separated from my child?

47
00:03:24,455 --> 00:03:27,045
Are you here telling me to wait even longer?

48
00:03:27,045 --> 00:03:30,905
W-Wait, Mother, no, Mrs. Gyeong Ja, Ma Eum and I understand yo—

49
00:03:30,905 --> 00:03:33,255
You two don't understand me!

50
00:03:33,255 --> 00:03:35,055
You also don't know anything about my child.

51
00:03:35,055 --> 00:03:37,975
Dae Ryuk needs me right now!

52
00:03:39,255 --> 00:03:44,245
You think I won't be able to find him just because you people won't tell me!

53
00:03:49,485 --> 00:03:51,545
Wait, Mother.

54
00:03:54,885 --> 00:03:56,045
What's the matter?

55
00:03:56,045 --> 00:03:57,445
What's the deal with that woman?

56
00:03:57,445 --> 00:04:01,245
- Don't do it...
- Don't do what?

57
00:04:01,245 --> 00:04:05,305
She's completely different from Artist Sin Dae Ryuk.

58
00:04:06,835 --> 00:04:08,285
Deputy Editor...

59
00:04:08,285 --> 00:04:13,155
How would it be if we don't tell Artist Sin that his mother visited for now?

60
00:04:13,155 --> 00:04:16,895
Shouldn't we still share it with the artist?

61
00:04:17,725 --> 00:04:21,825
Did you hear something in advance about this matter?

62
00:04:21,825 --> 00:04:25,440
No, more than that, this is a critical time,

63
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,900
and it would disturb him unnecessarily.

64
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:43,005
 In "Peeve Weapon," 

65
00:04:43,005 --> 00:04:48,825
 I loved that I could strongly feel what you were lacking in life. 

66
00:04:48,825 --> 00:04:50,445
 What I was lacking? 

67
00:04:50,445 --> 00:04:56,145
 The story of a boy where that "Peeve" was your mom. 

68
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:12,035
I considered Neon's offer thorougly.

69
00:05:13,585 --> 00:05:14,765
I like it.

70
00:05:14,765 --> 00:05:19,095
It's all good, but the problem is that I know nothing about managing a company.

71
00:05:19,095 --> 00:05:23,245
I believe in the principle that everyone should make a living doing what he is good at.

72
00:05:23,245 --> 00:05:24,700
Even though I have been completely exhausted from working for someone else,

73
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:28,640
I've never dared to think about starting my own company.

74
00:05:31,355 --> 00:05:34,855
Please consider it with more of an open mind.

75
00:05:34,855 --> 00:05:38,875
As far as management, you can also have something like a Co-CEO.

76
00:05:38,875 --> 00:05:40,965
- Exactly. 
 - Sorry?

77
00:05:40,965 --> 00:05:45,845
So, with these conditions, I think I'd be able to accept Neon Webtoon's offer.

78
00:05:56,545 --> 00:05:58,935
I've been thinking of doing this all along.

79
00:05:58,935 --> 00:06:01,035
I think it's a good opportunity.

80
00:06:02,125 --> 00:06:04,565
I mean it. I think this is the time to do it.

81
00:06:04,565 --> 00:06:10,635
I missed it every time, b-but I-I guess it was meant to w-work out this way.

82
00:06:14,985 --> 00:06:17,845
Artist Na Gang Nam also was willing.

83
00:06:17,845 --> 00:06:20,925
If we organize the plan for the establishment and operation of an affiliate,

84
00:06:20,925 --> 00:06:23,945
- it would be appealing to him.
 - That's good.

85
00:06:23,945 --> 00:06:25,435
Should I put a proposal together and send it to you?

86
00:06:25,435 --> 00:06:28,195
Gosh, you know what to do right away now.

87
00:06:28,195 --> 00:06:30,685
If he's good, he's Heung Bu. (Heung Bu: Korean folktale character known for his good character.)

88
00:06:30,685 --> 00:06:33,575
Aigoo, we just overcame one crisis.

89
00:06:33,575 --> 00:06:35,625
Everyone, please take good care of other artists, too,

90
00:06:35,625 --> 00:06:38,125
so that they can follow our lead.

91
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:40,075
Does anyone else have something to say?

92
00:06:40,075 --> 00:06:42,835
What did you just say? "If he's good, he's Heung Bu"?

93
00:06:42,835 --> 00:06:44,285
- If he's bad, then?
 - He'd be Yeong Bae.

94
00:06:44,285 --> 00:06:46,275
Correct.

95
00:06:47,351 --> 00:06:49,755
Acting like he's upset again, geez.

96
00:06:49,755 --> 00:06:54,315
By the way, PD On Ma Eum, Artist Sin's manuscript is coming out nice and funny, right?

97
00:06:54,315 --> 00:06:55,928
Yes.

98
00:07:09,555 --> 00:07:11,565
Since your manuscript was taking longer than usual,

99
00:07:11,565 --> 00:07:16,195
I came to see if your work is going well, Artist Sin.

100
00:07:16,195 --> 00:07:19,285
Are you okay, Artist Sin?

101
00:07:20,345 --> 00:07:22,975
I can't think of anything at all.

102
00:07:22,975 --> 00:07:27,905
It feels like the inside of my head suddenly went white and blank.

103
00:07:30,245 --> 00:07:32,965
It's okay since we still have some previews.

104
00:07:32,965 --> 00:07:35,245
You can take your time to pick up your pace again.

105
00:07:35,245 --> 00:07:38,305
This is the first time something like this has ever happened.

106
00:07:42,785 --> 00:07:46,235
It's also your first time to be running a weekly series.

107
00:07:46,235 --> 00:07:50,055
I think it's also natural for you to have writer's block temporarily.

108
00:07:50,055 --> 00:07:52,845
We just need to find a way for you to overcome it.

109
00:07:54,245 --> 00:07:59,115
Now, shall we start by talking about the spot where you're stuck?

110
00:07:59,115 --> 00:08:00,735
Okay...

111
00:08:08,495 --> 00:08:11,115
Is it because of Artist Sin Dae Ryuk?

112
00:08:12,415 --> 00:08:14,145
Yes...

113
00:08:16,255 --> 00:08:19,485
What do you think is the problem?

114
00:08:22,475 --> 00:08:25,185
- It's...
 - By the way,

115
00:08:25,185 --> 00:08:29,035
is it related to why his mother came here?

116
00:08:33,735 --> 00:08:36,815
Not only is getting involved in a personal matter risky for us,

117
00:08:36,815 --> 00:08:39,735
but also, wouldn't it be another matter

118
00:08:39,735 --> 00:08:42,695
for us to get involved and stand in between them?

119
00:08:43,465 --> 00:08:48,895
We don't know what's best for Artist Sin yet.

120
00:08:53,825 --> 00:08:57,965
I wanted to ask for your advice out of frustration, Mr. Baek.

121
00:08:57,965 --> 00:09:00,595
Not to mention, you also know Artist Sin Dae Ryuk well.

122
00:09:00,595 --> 00:09:02,165
Yes...

123
00:09:02,165 --> 00:09:06,365
I think it's a lot more serious than you think.

124
00:09:06,365 --> 00:09:08,435
Is it really?

125
00:09:10,445 --> 00:09:12,625
When I asked other PDs,

126
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:17,255
they said it's common for rookie artists to get writer's block.

127
00:09:17,255 --> 00:09:19,585
Yes. That's true.

128
00:09:19,585 --> 00:09:23,245
But that is the problem

129
00:09:23,245 --> 00:09:29,895
because Sin Dae Ryuk has been working in a different manner from other people.

130
00:09:29,895 --> 00:09:34,635
For Dae Ryuk, who has been too busy to draw out the ideas pouring out of the sky,

131
00:09:34,635 --> 00:09:37,485
what he'd have to do to get his

132
00:09:37,485 --> 00:09:41,895
inspirations back, when his inspirations stopped coming...

133
00:09:42,785 --> 00:09:44,775
How should I explain?

134
00:09:44,775 --> 00:09:48,495
It's like the amount of work required to use a muscle

135
00:09:48,495 --> 00:09:52,275
that you've never used in life.

136
00:10:01,265 --> 00:10:03,655
Restroom, please.

137
00:10:03,655 --> 00:10:08,675
Artist Baek, did your lower back condition worsen?

138
00:10:10,028 --> 00:10:12,395
You kept massaging your hand.

139
00:10:12,395 --> 00:10:16,505
Your pain must be pretty bad if you need to do that.

140
00:10:16,505 --> 00:10:19,265
Well, I'm never perfectly well anyway.

141
00:10:32,635 --> 00:10:36,695
I guess you're completely used to working together now?

142
00:10:36,695 --> 00:10:38,715
I also don't look for you as often, right?

143
00:10:38,715 --> 00:10:41,245
That's true. It's a little upsetting.

144
00:10:41,245 --> 00:10:43,915
- Seriously?
 - I mean it.

145
00:10:43,915 --> 00:10:47,935
Isn't it good for the artist to frequently look for the PD in charge?

146
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:53,055
If I were just a bit more slow-witted, I'd have misunderstood you just now.

147
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:54,335
What do you mean?

148
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:59,505
If I didn't know that you like someone else, what you said would have made my heart flutter.

149
00:11:00,225 --> 00:11:02,255
Have you confessed yet?

150
00:11:05,135 --> 00:11:08,485
I think you'd better confess your feelings soon.

151
00:11:08,485 --> 00:11:13,135
Even from a woman's perspective, she's very charming.

152
00:11:13,135 --> 00:11:18,215
Wow, Artist Pomme, your manuscript got a lot better nowadays.

153
00:11:33,485 --> 00:11:34,905
One.

154
00:11:34,905 --> 00:11:36,145
Two.

155
00:11:36,145 --> 00:11:37,385
Three.

156
00:11:37,385 --> 00:11:38,625
Four.

157
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:39,855
Five.

158
00:11:39,855 --> 00:11:41,055
Six.

159
00:11:41,055 --> 00:11:42,335
Seven.

160
00:11:42,335 --> 00:11:43,725
Eight.

161
00:11:43,725 --> 00:11:46,495
- Nine.
 - What are you doing?

162
00:11:46,495 --> 00:11:48,785
You're back?

163
00:11:50,475 --> 00:11:55,875
Sometimes, if I work out my body first, my brain tends to work better.

164
00:11:55,875 --> 00:11:58,415
 I think you'd better confess your feelings soon. 

165
00:11:58,415 --> 00:12:02,705
 Even from a woman's perspective, she's very charming. 

166
00:12:04,095 --> 00:12:07,765
- What? Why are you blushing? 
- What?

167
00:12:08,535 --> 00:12:10,295
- No, I'm noy. 
 - You're not?

168
00:12:10,295 --> 00:12:13,855
Right. Did the thing with Artist Sin get resolved?

169
00:12:13,855 --> 00:12:16,185
Oh, that...

170
00:12:16,185 --> 00:12:19,450
I think it'll be resolved somehow,

171
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:21,880
but I'm still mulling things over.

172
00:12:21,885 --> 00:12:23,675
In what way?

173
00:12:24,465 --> 00:12:25,875
Anyway.

174
00:12:25,875 --> 00:12:28,025
It's a secret.

175
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:44,165
Yes, hello?

176
00:12:44,165 --> 00:12:47,265
Artist Sin, I'm near your studio right now

177
00:12:47,265 --> 00:12:51,325
and on the way to your house with someone.

178
00:12:56,975 --> 00:12:59,955
Who is she bringing?

179
00:13:08,775 --> 00:13:10,895
Hello.

180
00:13:16,215 --> 00:13:18,005
Artist Sin.

181
00:13:24,305 --> 00:13:26,005
How did you come here, Hyeong?

182
00:13:26,005 --> 00:13:27,745
How do you do?

183
00:13:27,745 --> 00:13:31,645
Don't you need an assistant by any chance, Artist Sin?

184
00:13:38,565 --> 00:13:41,785
I heard about you through Mr. Baek.

185
00:13:41,785 --> 00:13:45,905
He came up to Seoul right away wanting to help you as soon as he heard about you.

186
00:13:45,905 --> 00:13:47,665
Still, how can I make Hyeong do...

187
00:13:47,665 --> 00:13:52,385
I might not look it, but I'm a high-spec assistant who worked under a master for ten years.

188
00:13:52,385 --> 00:13:54,945
Are you going to reject me by chance?

189
00:13:56,279 --> 00:13:59,475
I was about to call you to demand the next episode of "Peeve Weapon."

190
00:13:59,475 --> 00:14:03,195
If this gets delayed, you'll be stoned by the readers.

191
00:14:03,195 --> 00:14:06,310
If you go on a break after making them curious about what's next, it's a crime.

192
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:08,160
A crime.

193
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:12,665
Thank you, Hyeong.

194
00:14:13,485 --> 00:14:16,445
- Thank you.
 - No problem.

195
00:14:17,102 --> 00:14:19,435
 Hello, this is Webtoon Witch. 

196
00:14:19,435 --> 00:14:21,905
 Everyone, today's webtoon for review is 

197
00:14:21,905 --> 00:14:24,765
 - Artist Lee Wu Jin's "Full Count."  
- Oh, wait...

198
00:14:24,765 --> 00:14:27,265
 Is "Full Count" eventually... 

199
00:14:27,265 --> 00:14:29,725
Wait, did I eat too much? Oh, wait...

200
00:14:29,725 --> 00:14:32,925
-  just a story about romance on a baseball field?  
- What's happening? It's coming out

201
00:14:32,925 --> 00:14:34,805
 There are a lot of people saying that romance is indeed interesting... 

202
00:14:34,805 --> 00:14:37,345
W-Wait, wait.

203
00:14:42,242 --> 00:14:44,843
Oh, my gosh, what do I do?

204
00:14:44,843 --> 00:14:47,263
I'm home.

205
00:14:52,836 --> 00:14:55,293
 - Why are there opinions like this?  
- Webtoon Witch?

206
00:14:55,293 --> 00:14:57,913
 Surprisingly, "Full Count" was, in fact, 

207
00:14:57,913 --> 00:15:02,123
-  popular as a growth-story.  
- It's about "Full Count" this time?

208
00:15:02,123 --> 00:15:03,693
 - Why?  
- What?

209
00:15:03,693 --> 00:15:05,763
 A woman trying out for professional baseball, not a man. 

210
00:15:05,763 --> 00:15:08,713
 For a female main character to dream of becoming a professional baseball player 

211
00:15:08,713 --> 00:15:11,233
-  is a very refreshing topic.  
- Why is she editing this?

212
00:15:11,233 --> 00:15:14,983
 However, because of the physical differences between a man and a woman, 

213
00:15:14,983 --> 00:15:17,353
 the main character eventually realizes the obstacle in reality. 

214
00:15:17,353 --> 00:15:19,273
- Hello, Eonni.
  - Still, fitting for a main character, 

215
00:15:19,273 --> 00:15:21,083
- Nu Ri.
 -  Mal Yeong starts to show 

216
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:23,753
 how she's growing up over time. 

217
00:15:23,753 --> 00:15:26,823
 Why? Because she's our main character. 

218
00:15:26,823 --> 00:15:28,413
 All of a sudden, however... 

219
00:15:28,413 --> 00:15:30,393
- Hey, you!
 - Eonni!

220
00:15:30,393 --> 00:15:31,573
- Hey!
 - Wait, wait!

221
00:15:31,573 --> 00:15:32,653
I can explain this!

222
00:15:32,653 --> 00:15:35,263
You know exactly what kind of work I do right now!

223
00:15:35,263 --> 00:15:37,173
Please listen to me first!

224
00:15:37,173 --> 00:15:38,753
You? Her?

225
00:15:38,753 --> 00:15:41,573
Hey, come right here.

226
00:15:44,173 --> 00:15:47,283
Yes, Artist Dong Hui, is there something wrong?

227
00:15:49,473 --> 00:15:51,653
Yes, I'll head over there then.

228
00:15:51,653 --> 00:15:53,463
Okay.

229
00:15:54,423 --> 00:15:57,913
S***, I'll see you when I get back!

230
00:16:00,553 --> 00:16:02,553
Don't come back!

231
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:10,003
I don't know how I should break this to you, but...

232
00:16:10,003 --> 00:16:16,063
I don't think I can resolve the problem with Dae Ryuk's manuscript.

233
00:16:17,203 --> 00:16:18,423
Why?

234
00:16:18,423 --> 00:16:22,543
If something happened while the two of you were working together—

235
00:16:22,543 --> 00:16:24,883
No, no. It's nothing like that.

236
00:16:24,883 --> 00:16:29,413
Right now, the main issue with Dae Ryuk is

237
00:16:29,413 --> 00:16:31,463
not a problem with his drawing.

238
00:16:31,463 --> 00:16:34,663
It's a psychological issue, I think.

239
00:16:35,473 --> 00:16:41,063
Perhaps, do you have an idea about what it could be about?

240
00:16:51,053 --> 00:16:55,993
 My whole life has been a series of bad luck events. 

241
00:16:55,993 --> 00:16:58,983
 I may be a mess, but... 

242
00:16:58,983 --> 00:17:01,993
 please help me... 

243
00:17:01,993 --> 00:17:04,263
 so I don't become a bigger mess. 

244
00:17:07,514 --> 00:17:10,643
 With you by my side... 

245
00:17:10,643 --> 00:17:12,813
 I think I could also... 

246
00:17:13,513 --> 00:17:16,803
 run escape from bad luck and misfortune. 

247
00:17:21,293 --> 00:17:24,573
 Not only is getting involved in a personal matter risky for us, 

248
00:17:24,573 --> 00:17:27,343
 but also wouldn't it be another matter 

249
00:17:27,343 --> 00:17:30,013
 for us to get involved and stand in between them? 

250
00:17:30,923 --> 00:17:32,893
 You two don't understand me! 

251
00:17:32,893 --> 00:17:34,583
 You also don't know anything about my child! 

252
00:17:34,583 --> 00:17:37,643
 Dae Ryuk needs me right now! 

253
00:17:44,143 --> 00:17:48,583
Artist Sin... are you, by chance

254
00:17:48,583 --> 00:17:50,983
not able to focus right now because of the past

255
00:17:50,983 --> 00:17:53,883
events that you spoke of last time?

256
00:17:55,633 --> 00:17:58,983
It felt like you had a knot that couldn't be untied

257
00:17:58,983 --> 00:18:03,443
when you told me your story.

258
00:18:04,373 --> 00:18:06,943
Could your suffering like this right now

259
00:18:06,943 --> 00:18:10,733
also be caused by your unhealed wound?

260
00:18:11,663 --> 00:18:13,823
I do have one thing

261
00:18:14,673 --> 00:18:17,613
I want to ask her.

262
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:23,743
"Why did you do that to me?"

263
00:18:28,133 --> 00:18:33,413
Artist Sin, by any chance, are you willing to meet your mother?

264
00:18:33,413 --> 00:18:34,723
No.

265
00:18:34,723 --> 00:18:37,933
Just thinking about that person is a horror.

266
00:18:40,323 --> 00:18:43,633
I do not want to see that person again for the rest of my life.

267
00:18:46,463 --> 00:18:48,633
One moment, please.

268
00:18:59,983 --> 00:19:01,833
Who are you?

269
00:19:05,763 --> 00:19:07,843
Dae Ryuk.

270
00:19:08,793 --> 00:19:10,883
It's me, your mom.

271
00:19:10,883 --> 00:19:14,913
Dae Ryuk, It's mommy.

272
00:19:22,513 --> 00:19:23,603
Are you okay, Mother?

273
00:19:23,603 --> 00:19:27,243
I'm okay... I'm fine.

274
00:19:27,243 --> 00:19:29,163
Did you call this person here, PD On?

275
00:19:29,163 --> 00:19:31,463
No, I didn't, Artist Sin!

276
00:19:32,371 --> 00:19:34,113
No, Dae Ryuk.

277
00:19:34,113 --> 00:19:37,173
- Mommy just... missed you so much—
- Get away.

278
00:19:37,173 --> 00:19:39,913
Get out, get out!

279
00:20:10,223 --> 00:20:13,033
I don't know who he takes after.

280
00:20:15,203 --> 00:20:17,853
How did you know about this place?

281
00:20:19,033 --> 00:20:23,823
I just... followed you, PD On.

282
00:20:23,823 --> 00:20:27,333
- Mother.
 - I told you.

283
00:20:27,333 --> 00:20:29,413
I don't have much time.

284
00:20:29,413 --> 00:20:30,923
Okay?

285
00:20:44,513 --> 00:20:47,833
 PD On Ma Eum 

286
00:20:56,033 --> 00:20:57,843
 Dae Ryuk. 

287
00:20:57,843 --> 00:21:01,783
 Dae Ryuk... It's me, your mom. 

288
00:21:15,323 --> 00:21:19,103
Let's start the meeting.

289
00:21:19,103 --> 00:21:22,453
First of all, PD Choi, did you pick a good item for Artist Oh Yun's new series?

290
00:21:22,453 --> 00:21:24,973
Yes, I think Artist Oh got the hang of it.

291
00:21:24,973 --> 00:21:26,763
Just look at this guy's face.

292
00:21:26,763 --> 00:21:28,363
It came out well, didn't it?

293
00:21:28,363 --> 00:21:29,503
I'll be looking forward to it.

294
00:21:29,503 --> 00:21:31,613
Next, PD Gi, what about the short story series you're planning?

295
00:21:31,613 --> 00:21:33,673
Since romantic fantasies are trending so much,

296
00:21:33,673 --> 00:21:37,483
we're preparing one where the main character gets possessed into a romantic fantasy.

297
00:21:37,483 --> 00:21:42,743
We even have... a handful of readers suggesting that we somehow change

298
00:21:42,743 --> 00:21:44,643
"Peeve Weapon" into a romantic rantasy.

299
00:21:44,643 --> 00:21:47,073
Nah. Even if romantic fantasy is trending,

300
00:21:47,073 --> 00:21:49,153
with the drawing style of "Peeve Weapon," it's a bit...

301
00:21:49,153 --> 00:21:51,153
Okay, I'll consider it, at least.

302
00:21:51,153 --> 00:21:52,230
 Na Gang Nam Studio 

303
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:55,150
Na Gang Nam Studio is sailing smoothly, right?

304
00:21:55,153 --> 00:21:56,653
Yes, it's progressing without problems.

305
00:21:56,653 --> 00:21:59,203
Of course. We know who's in charge.

306
00:21:59,203 --> 00:22:01,253
It's my turn.

307
00:22:01,253 --> 00:22:03,643
The executives' meeting is really facing us now, right?

308
00:22:03,643 --> 00:22:08,273
I'm going to talk about two things as the main topics at this executives' meeting.

309
00:22:08,273 --> 00:22:13,523
The first one is making Artist Sin's "Peeve Weapon" into a drama.

310
00:22:13,523 --> 00:22:18,053
Also, the possibility of continuing it into season two at the time of adaptation.

311
00:22:18,053 --> 00:22:20,343
The second one is Na Gang Nam Studio.

312
00:22:20,343 --> 00:22:24,393
I'm going to try pushing these two issues.

313
00:22:24,393 --> 00:22:25,763
A blessing in disguise.

314
00:22:25,763 --> 00:22:27,733
If this briefing goes well,

315
00:22:27,733 --> 00:22:30,733
our team's position within Neon Webtoon might improve.

316
00:22:30,733 --> 00:22:32,603
To achieve that,

317
00:22:32,603 --> 00:22:37,203
we need Artist Sin to keep churning out the series without problems like now.

318
00:22:37,203 --> 00:22:39,553
You've done more than well thus far.

319
00:22:39,553 --> 00:22:43,643
But PD On, please carry on for just a little more.

320
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:45,563
Yes.

321
00:22:45,563 --> 00:22:48,663
She matured more or something, right?

322
00:22:53,563 --> 00:22:55,713
Is something wrong?

323
00:22:58,993 --> 00:23:01,883
This was my secret place...

324
00:23:04,893 --> 00:23:11,333
Artist Sin has writer's block right now.

325
00:23:11,333 --> 00:23:15,263
Could it be related to his mother?

326
00:23:15,923 --> 00:23:18,123
Yeah.

327
00:23:18,123 --> 00:23:21,803
He's having a hard time because of a personal issue,

328
00:23:22,643 --> 00:23:24,663
but for our team,

329
00:23:24,663 --> 00:23:29,073
I need his series to be running at the same pace.

330
00:23:29,073 --> 00:23:31,333
He's struggling as is, yet

331
00:23:31,333 --> 00:23:35,113
I'm in a situation where I need to keep pressuring him to work.

332
00:23:35,983 --> 00:23:38,713
I'm having a hard time with it.

333
00:23:38,713 --> 00:23:41,923
Since PD On Ma Eum always did a good job,

334
00:23:44,083 --> 00:23:46,123
she'll also overcome this one.

335
00:23:46,123 --> 00:23:50,493
So have some confidence and cheer up.

336
00:23:52,353 --> 00:23:57,123
Hey, you seem to say "cheer up" more often than I do lately.

337
00:23:57,123 --> 00:23:58,763
Do I?

338
00:23:58,763 --> 00:24:00,633
Thank you.

339
00:24:03,653 --> 00:24:05,773
I'll cheer up.

340
00:24:07,083 --> 00:24:09,063
I need to cheer up.

341
00:24:24,113 --> 00:24:28,103
Now there are no more

342
00:24:28,103 --> 00:24:31,703
preview episodes after this one, Artist Sin.

343
00:24:31,703 --> 00:24:33,083
Then...

344
00:24:33,083 --> 00:24:35,863
To prevent a break in a series,

345
00:24:35,863 --> 00:24:40,983
the manuscript needs to be finished by the deadline at the end of this week.

346
00:24:43,103 --> 00:24:45,483
I'm really sorry.

347
00:24:47,453 --> 00:24:50,973
But I can't think of anything right now.

348
00:24:54,113 --> 00:24:57,113
Why don't you try meeting your mother?

349
00:24:58,323 --> 00:25:01,013
You said you had one thing you wanted to ask her.

350
00:25:01,013 --> 00:25:03,773
After hearing the answer, maybe...

351
00:25:03,773 --> 00:25:05,753
I don't want to.

352
00:25:05,753 --> 00:25:09,633
- If that woman meets me, she'll agai—
 - Artist Sin.

353
00:25:16,273 --> 00:25:21,473
You're not that weak little boy anymore.

354
00:25:23,773 --> 00:25:25,943
I'll go with you.

355
00:26:09,823 --> 00:26:11,843
W-Wait.

356
00:26:13,603 --> 00:26:17,433
Artist Sin Dae Ryuk has difficulty with someone touching him.

357
00:26:18,043 --> 00:26:19,893
Why?

358
00:26:20,583 --> 00:26:23,953
Because you had me tied like a dog.

359
00:26:23,953 --> 00:26:29,083
You, remember that?

360
00:26:30,023 --> 00:26:32,013
Remember?

361
00:26:32,013 --> 00:26:33,333
Of course.

362
00:26:33,333 --> 00:26:36,683
What's the reason for your shameless return?

363
00:26:36,683 --> 00:26:39,303
What exactly do you want?

364
00:26:41,163 --> 00:26:43,803
I just missed you so much.

365
00:26:50,023 --> 00:26:53,203
Let it all out. Please?

366
00:26:53,203 --> 00:26:56,353
The words you wanted to say to me.

367
00:26:57,123 --> 00:26:59,433
I'll listen to whatever curse or resentment you have.

368
00:26:59,433 --> 00:27:01,433
I don't need to.

369
00:27:02,103 --> 00:27:05,083
Whatever we do, nothing changes what you did.

370
00:27:05,083 --> 00:27:07,323
Nothing changes.

371
00:27:08,593 --> 00:27:10,673
I'm sorry...

372
00:27:11,663 --> 00:27:14,383
Why did you do that to me?

373
00:27:15,723 --> 00:27:17,913
Why did you?

374
00:27:17,913 --> 00:27:19,863
Why...

375
00:27:19,863 --> 00:27:21,873
Why...

376
00:27:22,883 --> 00:27:25,263
Why did you abandon me?

377
00:27:27,243 --> 00:27:33,503
I couldn't take responsibility for you.

378
00:27:35,883 --> 00:27:38,793
I had no other family members,

379
00:27:38,793 --> 00:27:43,283
so I had to leave you alone at home to go make money.

380
00:27:44,743 --> 00:27:47,633
Although I knew that you hated it so much,

381
00:27:47,633 --> 00:27:50,233
I had to tie you up like that.

382
00:27:52,873 --> 00:27:55,263
When I came back...

383
00:27:55,994 --> 00:27:58,277
I was afraid that each and every day of that

384
00:27:58,277 --> 00:28:02,987
would never end until I died, Dae Ryuk.

385
00:28:04,383 --> 00:28:06,813
What about now, then?

386
00:28:06,813 --> 00:28:09,273
Can you take responsibility now?

387
00:28:10,803 --> 00:28:12,853
Tell me honestly.

388
00:28:13,863 --> 00:28:18,883
Thinking of my money, didn't you come to get money from me?

389
00:28:29,183 --> 00:28:33,163
I think it was pointless for me to come. I'm sorry.

390
00:28:33,163 --> 00:28:34,903
Mother...

391
00:28:40,443 --> 00:28:42,343
Mother!

392
00:28:57,973 --> 00:28:59,713
Mother.

393
00:29:01,383 --> 00:29:02,993
Mother!

394
00:29:03,733 --> 00:29:05,523
Mother...

395
00:29:14,173 --> 00:29:16,463
Yes, Deputy Editor.

396
00:29:19,713 --> 00:29:21,283
What?

397
00:29:23,343 --> 00:29:25,403
 Exposing Artist Sin Dae Ryuk! 

398
00:29:25,403 --> 00:29:29,523
There are all kinds of explosive stories on Artist Sin Dae Ryuk all over the place!

399
00:29:30,873 --> 00:29:34,903
How can people just post these without checking the facts?

400
00:29:34,903 --> 00:29:39,053
The large image of the employee's business card is posted to prove the story, too. 
  NEON PD On Ma Eum 

401
00:29:41,363 --> 00:29:43,123
Have you contacted the source?

402
00:29:43,123 --> 00:29:46,453
I think we need PD On Ma Eum here to confirm.

403
00:29:49,173 --> 00:29:50,763
On Ma Eum.

404
00:29:50,763 --> 00:29:52,413
What happened?

405
00:29:52,413 --> 00:29:55,753
I heard you went to the police station over Artist Sin!

406
00:29:56,553 --> 00:29:57,823
Well, that's...

407
00:29:57,823 --> 00:30:00,533
Did you cover that up?

408
00:30:03,163 --> 00:30:05,763
I'm sorry. I told her that it'd be better to keep it quiet.

409
00:30:05,763 --> 00:30:07,743
- What?
 - No. That's not it.

410
00:30:07,743 --> 00:30:10,273
I made a request to PD Gu Jun Yeong.

411
00:30:10,273 --> 00:30:14,983
I was afraid Artist Sin's debut would get canceled.

412
00:30:14,983 --> 00:30:18,283
So you two

413
00:30:18,283 --> 00:30:20,363
consulted each other and decided not to

414
00:30:20,363 --> 00:30:23,373
report an issue that might affect the team— No,

415
00:30:23,373 --> 00:30:28,483
an issue that might affect the entire company, yes?

416
00:30:28,483 --> 00:30:31,133
I'm sorry. I was rash.

417
00:30:31,133 --> 00:30:33,043
I'm sorry.

418
00:30:34,013 --> 00:30:36,713
It was a misunderstanding while he was sketching.

419
00:30:36,713 --> 00:30:40,023
In fact, Artist Sin was the one who was beaten down.

420
00:30:40,023 --> 00:30:43,313
Artist Sin himself thought that he had done wrong

421
00:30:43,313 --> 00:30:45,263
and decided not to make an issue out of it,

422
00:30:45,263 --> 00:30:49,033
so I thought it was something that could be resolved like that.

423
00:30:49,033 --> 00:30:51,073
I'm so sorry.

424
00:30:51,073 --> 00:30:54,813
You still should've reported it!

425
00:30:54,813 --> 00:30:57,163
PD Kwon, that's enough.

426
00:30:57,163 --> 00:30:59,993
So the exposé article is different from the facts, right?

427
00:30:59,993 --> 00:31:01,613
Yes, it is.

428
00:31:01,613 --> 00:31:03,513
What a relief.

429
00:31:03,513 --> 00:31:06,383
Anyhow, Artist Sin can't be shaken right now.

430
00:31:06,383 --> 00:31:08,403
Let's control the situation and

431
00:31:08,403 --> 00:31:11,123
resolve it as much as we can by next week's executives' meeting.

432
00:31:11,123 --> 00:31:12,283
Don't worry too much about it.

433
00:31:12,283 --> 00:31:15,543
I'll make it so that the legal department can respond.

434
00:31:15,543 --> 00:31:17,843
It's not even a true story, right?

435
00:31:21,463 --> 00:31:24,223
Do you have the person's phone number?

436
00:31:24,223 --> 00:31:26,343
I have the detective's phone number.

437
00:31:26,343 --> 00:31:29,613
Gosh, what's going on here?

438
00:31:29,613 --> 00:31:32,573
It's a mess over here, too, with everyone trying to sort this out.

439
00:31:32,573 --> 00:31:36,833
Furthermore, we're talking about a crime-exposing article!

440
00:31:36,833 --> 00:31:39,063
That's not true at all.

441
00:31:39,063 --> 00:31:41,953
I'll sort out this situation right away.

442
00:31:43,503 --> 00:31:45,063
Direc—

443
00:31:50,863 --> 00:31:55,033
 I'm exposing Artist Sin of "Peeve Weapon." 

444
00:31:55,033 --> 00:31:58,893
 Popular Artist Sin went after my girlfriend and touched her, 

445
00:31:58,893 --> 00:32:01,363
 and I barely got there in time to stop him. 

446
00:32:01,363 --> 00:32:04,273
 I only lightly pushed him away to protect my girlfriend, 

447
00:32:04,273 --> 00:32:07,263
 but the female PD in charge of that artist came to the police station 

448
00:32:07,263 --> 00:32:11,473
 and forced me to keep my mouth shut, baselessly claiming I had hit him. 

449
00:32:18,053 --> 00:32:20,363
 Artist Sin Dae Ryuk (Perpetrator)] 

450
00:32:29,003 --> 00:32:31,283
He's not even answering his phone.

451
00:32:31,283 --> 00:32:34,933
Did Artist Sin Dae Ryuk take any photo evidence of the beating?

452
00:32:34,933 --> 00:32:37,043
Most likely not.

453
00:32:37,043 --> 00:32:38,923
 Artist Sin Dae Ryuk (Detective) 

454
00:32:42,263 --> 00:32:45,303
Hello Detective, this is On Ma Eum, who called you earlier.

455
00:32:45,303 --> 00:32:48,673
The other party isn't picking up our calls.

456
00:32:48,673 --> 00:32:50,973
I called you to ask if you could

457
00:32:50,973 --> 00:32:54,443
contact him for us since this is your case.

458
00:32:55,763 --> 00:32:58,923
And the CCTV footage we asked you about earlier—

459
00:33:00,753 --> 00:33:03,983
Okay, I understand. Thank you.

460
00:33:05,103 --> 00:33:06,493
He said he couldn't?

461
00:33:06,493 --> 00:33:10,243
Yeah, I think we need to obtain the CCTV footage ourselves, too.

462
00:33:10,243 --> 00:33:13,313
Sir, I'm sorry, but please go to Yeonju Church.

463
00:33:14,493 --> 00:33:16,053
Let's check it out.

464
00:33:16,053 --> 00:33:19,053
Whether it's a dashcam or a CCTV from a store,

465
00:33:19,053 --> 00:33:22,683
we might be able to find a trace or witnesses.

466
00:33:26,213 --> 00:33:27,713
I'm sorry.

467
00:33:27,713 --> 00:33:28,873
For what?

468
00:33:28,873 --> 00:33:31,433
I put you in a difficult situation.

469
00:33:31,433 --> 00:33:34,193
We made the decision together.

470
00:33:34,193 --> 00:33:37,483
So it's only right that we take responsibility together.

471
00:33:46,173 --> 00:33:48,613
Even PD On Ma Eum's business card has been exposed.

472
00:33:48,613 --> 00:33:49,693
 Neon, On Ma Eum, Webtoon Service 

473
00:33:49,693 --> 00:33:52,013
Hasn't she contacted you?

474
00:33:52,013 --> 00:33:58,513
Could PD On be put in a difficult situation because of this?

475
00:33:58,513 --> 00:34:00,283
This is the webtoon?

476
00:34:00,283 --> 00:34:02,313
Even a one-star rating is too much for this bastard.

477
00:34:02,313 --> 00:34:04,083
 Lame webtoon, lame artist. 

478
00:34:04,083 --> 00:34:06,763
- Totally sucks.
  - Shouldn't it be Criminal Weapon, not Peeve Weapon? 

479
00:34:06,763 --> 00:34:08,803
These kinds of people need some rating terrorism.

480
00:34:08,803 --> 00:34:12,293
 I wondered if the artist was a psycho, but I guess it was true. 

481
00:34:13,523 --> 00:34:16,543
Yes, we're currently discussing it ith our customer service and legal team.

482
00:34:16,543 --> 00:34:19,433
Yes, of course, it's not true.

483
00:34:19,433 --> 00:34:22,093
Yes, I'll follow up with you as soon as the situation is sorted out.

484
00:34:22,093 --> 00:34:24,083
Yes, I understand.

485
00:34:25,143 --> 00:34:27,603
An article has been released.

486
00:34:27,603 --> 00:34:30,973
Other departments keep calling regarding advertisement and marketing inquiries.

487
00:34:30,973 --> 00:34:32,943
What should we do?

488
00:34:34,363 --> 00:34:36,273
I'm going nuts.

489
00:34:43,283 --> 00:34:45,833
 No wonder the art was really lame, too. 
  Please take down the Peeve Weapon review video.  

490
00:34:45,833 --> 00:34:49,023
They're even making a fuss on my channel.

491
00:34:49,023 --> 00:34:51,123
Why, what's wrong?

492
00:34:51,123 --> 00:34:54,413
Well, that Peeve Weapon artist.

493
00:34:54,413 --> 00:34:58,263
Everyone's going crazy over the crime-exposing article.

494
00:34:58,263 --> 00:34:59,933
It's even like this here.

495
00:34:59,933 --> 00:35:02,863
Imagine how chaotic it must be at Eonni's company.

496
00:35:02,863 --> 00:35:04,673
- Let me see.
 - You can't.

497
00:35:04,673 --> 00:35:06,703
- Huh?
 - You can't, you can't, you can't!

498
00:35:06,703 --> 00:35:09,853
Take it. I'll let you read it if you can take it from me.

499
00:35:17,123 --> 00:35:19,943
I think we should look around here.

500
00:35:20,993 --> 00:35:24,083
There aren't any street CCTVs.

501
00:35:24,953 --> 00:35:27,023
Should we try to ask for the store CCTVs?

502
00:35:27,023 --> 00:35:28,383
Let's go over there.

503
00:35:28,383 --> 00:35:30,463
Okay, okay.

504
00:35:30,463 --> 00:35:33,183
Our CCTV? It's been broken for a while now.

505
00:35:33,183 --> 00:35:35,453
It doesn't work?

506
00:35:36,603 --> 00:35:39,383
Thank you.

507
00:35:39,383 --> 00:35:41,890
Do you happen to have a CCTV outside?

508
00:35:47,850 --> 00:35:49,640
Seriously.

509
00:35:51,553 --> 00:35:53,663
Yes, hello?

510
00:35:54,803 --> 00:35:56,413
Kang Gyeong Ja?

511
00:35:56,413 --> 00:35:58,503
Yes, I know her.

512
00:35:59,293 --> 00:36:00,933
What?

513
00:36:05,173 --> 00:36:07,553
All right. Got it.

514
00:36:07,553 --> 00:36:09,453
All right.

515
00:36:09,453 --> 00:36:10,953
What's wrong?

516
00:36:10,953 --> 00:36:14,493
Artist Sin Dae Ryuk's mother got into an accident,

517
00:36:14,493 --> 00:36:16,413
but they can't find any guardians.

518
00:36:16,413 --> 00:36:18,773
I'll stay and look around, so you should go.

519
00:36:18,773 --> 00:36:20,323
I'm so sorry. How could I?

520
00:36:20,323 --> 00:36:22,163
You said loving my coworker is loving my country.  (Korean saying usually for military service.) 

521
00:36:22,163 --> 00:36:23,503
I can at least do this.

522
00:36:23,503 --> 00:36:25,603
Hurry up and go.

523
00:36:25,603 --> 00:36:27,473
Taxi!

524
00:36:29,566 --> 00:36:30,819
Jun Yeong, I'm really sorry.

525
00:36:30,819 --> 00:36:32,889
I'll keep you posted.

526
00:36:35,173 --> 00:36:38,083
Can you go to Seongjin Hospital?

527
00:36:45,563 --> 00:36:46,433
Just stay put!

528
00:36:46,433 --> 00:36:48,123
- I'm going to leave!
 - Gosh, please!

529
00:36:48,123 --> 00:36:50,763
- Just stay put!
 - Ma'am!

530
00:36:50,763 --> 00:36:52,113
You're finally here!

531
00:36:52,113 --> 00:36:55,523
This ahjumma suddenly ran onto the road and scared the crap out of me!

532
00:36:55,523 --> 00:36:56,353
Whoa, hold on!

533
00:36:56,353 --> 00:36:59,843
How could you let a dementia patient walk around on the streets?

534
00:36:59,843 --> 00:37:01,833
What do you mean, dementia patient?

535
00:37:02,543 --> 00:37:04,903
Gosh, look at this.

536
00:37:10,093 --> 00:37:12,813
 I am a dementia patient...
 Please be sympathetic for my difficult situation and... 

537
00:37:14,083 --> 00:37:17,900
 Dementia Patient Card: Kang Gyeong Ja 

538
00:37:20,203 --> 00:37:22,473
Ahjumma, you're here to pick me up?

539
00:37:22,473 --> 00:37:24,693
Take me with you.

540
00:37:24,693 --> 00:37:26,783
I have somewhere to go.

541
00:37:26,783 --> 00:37:28,383
I hate hospitals.

542
00:37:28,383 --> 00:37:31,323
I have somewhere to go. I hate hospitals.

543
00:37:31,323 --> 00:37:33,193
Ma'am...

544
00:37:41,233 --> 00:37:44,493
You know, I'm really okay now.

545
00:37:44,493 --> 00:37:46,263
You should go, PD On.

546
00:37:46,263 --> 00:37:49,503
I'm still worried.

547
00:37:49,503 --> 00:37:51,043
My room is right here.

548
00:37:51,043 --> 00:37:53,523
Really. I'm really fine.

549
00:37:53,523 --> 00:37:55,363
Go on.

550
00:37:57,333 --> 00:37:58,960
Okay.

551
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:02,450
 Motel 

552
00:38:09,743 --> 00:38:11,873
He's inside.

553
00:38:18,243 --> 00:38:20,943
I'm sorry, PD On.

554
00:38:20,943 --> 00:38:22,933
It's all right, Artist Sin.

555
00:38:22,933 --> 00:38:25,843
You're probably suffering the most.

556
00:38:25,843 --> 00:38:28,053
Have you eaten yet?

557
00:38:28,053 --> 00:38:31,633
Dae Ryuk has been starving the whole day.

558
00:38:33,663 --> 00:38:36,166
You should still eat, Artist Sin.

559
00:38:36,166 --> 00:38:39,523
We're also working really hard to disprove the false information.

560
00:38:39,523 --> 00:38:40,706
Don't worry.

561
00:38:40,706 --> 00:38:44,236
It'll definitely work out.

562
00:38:46,653 --> 00:38:48,993
And Artist Sin,

563
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:52,713
- Your mother—
- This happened because I'm such an idiot.

564
00:38:53,503 --> 00:38:56,453
I'm really sorry.

565
00:38:59,533 --> 00:39:05,803
I screwed up everything that we made together.

566
00:39:09,982 --> 00:39:12,263
Don't be too hard on yourself.

567
00:39:12,263 --> 00:39:14,653
It's not entirely your fault.

568
00:39:22,823 --> 00:39:25,443
 I told you... 

569
00:39:25,443 --> 00:39:28,883
 that I don't have much time. 

570
00:39:28,883 --> 00:39:31,873
 I just missed you so much. 

571
00:39:37,977 --> 00:39:39,283
Of course, I remember!

572
00:39:39,283 --> 00:39:43,283
That giant of a man beat someone to a pulp,

573
00:39:43,283 --> 00:39:47,943
and everyone here gathered around and recorded it with their phones. It was crazy!

574
00:39:47,943 --> 00:39:50,933
Then there must be a lot of people who have photos or videos, right?

575
00:39:50,933 --> 00:39:55,140
Of course! Everyone here took some!

576
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:57,650
Anyway, what should I do?

577
00:40:00,333 --> 00:40:03,493
Eonni must be having a hard time.

578
00:40:03,493 --> 00:40:05,833
I'm home.

579
00:40:07,853 --> 00:40:09,733
Eonni.

580
00:40:09,733 --> 00:40:11,713
Are you okay?

581
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:15,283
I saw the article. Is it true?

582
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:17,863
No. Of course not.

583
00:40:17,863 --> 00:40:20,233
Then how could he write that?

584
00:40:20,233 --> 00:40:24,926
What has Artist Sin Dae Ryuk ever done to him?

585
00:40:24,926 --> 00:40:26,866
Exactly.

586
00:40:29,263 --> 00:40:32,293
We'll have to find a solution however we can.

587
00:40:32,293 --> 00:40:34,063
Thanks.

588
00:40:35,063 --> 00:40:37,810
Everything will work out.

589
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:40,990
 Ma Eum's Room 

590
00:40:54,791 --> 00:40:57,191
 Neon 

591
00:40:57,191 --> 00:40:59,161
In this situation, 
  Neon, On Ma Eum, Webtoon Service 

592
00:40:59,161 --> 00:41:02,231
would holding an executives' meeting make a difference?

593
00:41:02,231 --> 00:41:05,361
That post includes false information. 
 Neon 

594
00:41:05,361 --> 00:41:07,411
I recommend the company take legal action.

595
00:41:07,411 --> 00:41:11,071
In any case, everything will be over if we just fire a single artist.

596
00:41:11,071 --> 00:41:15,051
There's no need to fight with the company's honor at stake.

597
00:41:16,201 --> 00:41:19,141
Getting rid of the webtoon team through this opportunity

598
00:41:19,141 --> 00:41:21,241
will be for the greater good of the company, CEO.

599
00:41:21,241 --> 00:41:23,871
How could you say that?

600
00:41:23,871 --> 00:41:25,991
We just need to straighten the facts that have been twisted.

601
00:41:25,991 --> 00:41:28,611
- Why— 
 - Even if the facts were twisted,

602
00:41:28,611 --> 00:41:33,871
it's true that Artist Sin Dae Ryuk was involved in a scandalous situation.

603
00:41:38,241 --> 00:41:43,401
Did you not have a grasp on the situation going on in your team?

604
00:41:44,118 --> 00:41:45,351
CEO!

605
00:41:45,351 --> 00:41:49,281
Didn't that artist also sign a dramatization contract?

606
00:41:54,471 --> 00:42:00,161
If you don't tell me immediately when something goes wrong, I'll have no way to protect you.

607
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:02,400
- I'm sorry. 
 - I'm sorry.

608
00:42:02,461 --> 00:42:06,171
So we don't even have any evidence to prove anything. Right?

609
00:42:06,171 --> 00:42:08,161
We weren't able to obtain any CCTV footage,

610
00:42:08,161 --> 00:42:12,421
but when I went around the area, there were quite a lot of people who witnessed it.

611
00:42:12,421 --> 00:42:16,821
Then is there a way to obtain those witnesses' videos?

612
00:42:16,821 --> 00:42:20,191
This wouldn't have happened if you had just told us from the start.

613
00:42:22,941 --> 00:42:26,991
Hello everyone, I'm Webtoon Witch.

614
00:42:28,401 --> 00:42:32,061
This is my first time broadcasting live,

615
00:42:32,061 --> 00:42:35,301
so I think a lot of you are surprised...

616
00:42:35,301 --> 00:42:41,121
Well, the reason why I'm broadcasting live like this is that I need all your help.

617
00:42:41,121 --> 00:42:43,871
On August 16, around 3:25 p.m.

618
00:42:43,871 --> 00:42:48,921
I'm looking for anyone who witnessed the physical assault that took place in front of Yeonju Church.

619
00:42:48,921 --> 00:42:51,181
 If anyone has photos or videos of the incident, 

620
00:42:51,181 --> 00:42:53,991
 you can contact Neon's SNS account, 

621
00:42:53,991 --> 00:42:57,061
 - which would be a huge help.  
- How did Webtoon Witch end up helping out?

622
00:42:57,751 --> 00:43:02,971
To be honest... she's my younger sister.

623
00:43:02,971 --> 00:43:05,181
I found out recently, too.

624
00:43:05,181 --> 00:43:08,111
Oh, okay.

625
00:43:08,111 --> 00:43:11,281
 - For those who provide help, the company— 
 - She might not get a good reaction,

626
00:43:11,281 --> 00:43:14,441
- but how nice of your sister.
  - will give you a free subscription to Neon Webtoon. 

627
00:43:14,441 --> 00:43:18,961
She said she'd help even if she lost subscribers.

628
00:43:18,961 --> 00:43:20,651
She holds great love for her channel, too.

629
00:43:20,651 --> 00:43:23,931
If we don't want to cause her any inconvenience, we must expose the truth.

630
00:43:23,931 --> 00:43:25,901
We should.

631
00:43:27,491 --> 00:43:31,301
The post you wrote earlier got shared a lot, too.

632
00:43:31,301 --> 00:43:33,111
Really?

633
00:43:34,491 --> 00:43:38,561
Then should we use various keywords to search SNS or community forums?

634
00:43:38,561 --> 00:43:40,491
There's a chance a photo or video could get posted.

635
00:43:40,491 --> 00:43:41,901
Sure.

636
00:43:44,921 --> 00:43:48,411
- Yeonju Church, Yeonju Church.
 - Yeonju Church?

637
00:43:48,411 --> 00:43:51,291
- I'll search on my phone.
 - Sounds good.

638
00:43:53,580 --> 00:43:55,671
But still, please?

639
00:43:55,671 --> 00:43:58,290
I think you should see Dae Ryuk next time.

640
00:43:58,290 --> 00:44:00,870
The situation right now is a bit...

641
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:07,511
I know... that our Dae Ryuk is in a difficult situation.

642
00:44:08,230 --> 00:44:11,881
But I still want to help him in some way.

643
00:44:15,910 --> 00:44:18,511
I just want to take care of him.

644
00:44:21,090 --> 00:44:27,361
I packed all the things he likes, so he'll eat well.

645
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:33,991
Please go back inside.

646
00:44:52,530 --> 00:44:55,831
Will you find an answer by sitting at the desk like that? Huh?

647
00:44:55,831 --> 00:44:58,291
Eating something and moving around will be more helpful.

648
00:44:58,291 --> 00:45:03,181
In order to recover from this situation, whether it's work or drawing.

649
00:45:03,181 --> 00:45:05,621
I don't think I can eat.

650
00:45:20,730 --> 00:45:23,401
Jun Yeong, coffee.

651
00:45:23,401 --> 00:45:24,401
Thank you.

652
00:45:24,401 --> 00:45:27,141
Nothing came up yet?

653
00:45:27,141 --> 00:45:29,811
All right.

654
00:45:29,811 --> 00:45:31,401
You got the tea, right?

655
00:45:31,401 --> 00:45:33,691
Yes, thank you. Thank you.

656
00:45:33,691 --> 00:45:35,031
You haven't found anything yet?

657
00:45:35,031 --> 00:45:36,661
Not yet.

658
00:45:36,661 --> 00:45:41,071
- Let's search a little more. 
- Okay.

659
00:45:41,071 --> 00:45:43,141
Oh, thank you.

660
00:45:43,141 --> 00:45:46,231
Hey.

661
00:45:46,231 --> 00:45:51,661
I just wanted to see certain CCTV footage. You're a cop. It's just mere footage. What jurisdiction?

662
00:45:51,661 --> 00:45:55,340
♫  I wish you'd hug me  ♫

663
00:45:56,291 --> 00:46:01,151
♫  That would be so nice  ♫

664
00:46:01,151 --> 00:46:04,841
♫  Like my mom  ♫

665
00:46:04,841 --> 00:46:09,060
♫  Say that you're on my side no matter what  ♫

♫  Don't try too hard  ♫

667
00:46:16,961 --> 00:46:19,361
♫  Take a break when it's too hard on you  ♫

668
00:46:19,361 --> 00:46:23,020
♫  There's still a lot of time  ♫

669
00:46:24,161 --> 00:46:31,871
♫  I'm wondering if I'm doing all right  ♫

670
00:46:31,871 --> 00:46:36,911
♫  Did I come away too far?  ♫

671
00:46:36,911 --> 00:46:42,931
 Go among the people and face them, although it may be tough. 

672
00:46:42,931 --> 00:46:47,111
 I'm sure you'll be able to feel what you've been missing 

673
00:46:47,111 --> 00:46:50,671
 all this time, Dae Ryuk. 

674

♫  I wish you'd hug me  ♫

675

♫  Say that you're on my side no matter what  ♫

678
00:47:08,451 --> 00:47:10,861
Still nothing.

♫  Don't try too hard  ♫

680
00:47:16,581 --> 00:47:18,141
There aren't any videos yet?

681
00:47:18,141 --> 00:47:22,880
No.

682
00:47:24,061 --> 00:47:25,461
 Neon Webtoon SNS 

683
00:47:25,461 --> 00:47:28,371
What have you been doing?

684
00:47:28,371 --> 00:47:30,491
Refreshing the page.

685
00:47:30,491 --> 00:47:35,551
I wanted to see if any reports were made. But there aren't any so far.

686
00:47:35,551 --> 00:47:38,311
Nothing will come up just because you keep refreshing.

687
00:47:38,311 --> 00:47:40,391
Let's go eat.

688
00:47:52,990 --> 00:47:54,361
What, what, what?

689
00:47:54,361 --> 00:47:56,051
Did something come up?

690
00:47:56,051 --> 00:47:58,191
Something came up!

691
00:47:58,191 --> 00:48:01,011
"This is the video of Artist Sin Dae Ryuk getting assaulted!"

692
00:48:01,011 --> 00:48:03,151
It's posted right here! 
  This is the video of Artist Sin Dae Ryuk getting assaulted! 

693
00:48:03,151 --> 00:48:06,631
I refreshed it, and it was right there!

694
00:48:08,310 --> 00:48:10,791
Refreshed... Wait, hold on!

695
00:48:10,791 --> 00:48:12,281
There's another one! "I saw it, too!"

696
00:48:12,281 --> 00:48:16,091
- He saw it, too!
  - Yes! We did it! 

697
00:48:16,091 --> 00:48:18,881
This is a video from a witness!

698
00:48:22,290 --> 00:48:24,911
Okay. Let's eat.

699
00:48:24,911 --> 00:48:27,541
Let's eat. Let's eat some food.

700
00:48:27,541 --> 00:48:28,711
I can't eat.

701
00:48:28,711 --> 00:48:33,961
Falling apart like this just makes it harder for the people working with you. Okay?

702
00:48:33,961 --> 00:48:35,921
Eat.

703
00:48:35,921 --> 00:48:38,790
If PD On's running around out there is to be meaningful,

704
00:48:38,790 --> 00:48:42,240
you need to do what you need to do here.

705
00:48:42,241 --> 00:48:44,551
Let's eat.

706
00:48:44,551 --> 00:48:46,501
Let's eat and work.

707
00:49:23,140 --> 00:49:27,341
Currently, a lot of video reports have surfaced, and it's spreading in other communities, too.

708
00:49:27,341 --> 00:49:32,151
Thanks to witnesses and witness accounts, at least the misunderstanding of Artist Sin harassing someone has been cleared.

709
00:49:32,151 --> 00:49:35,481
Aigoo...How's public sentiment?

710
00:49:35,481 --> 00:49:39,561
It's been revealed that the other party lied, so a lot of them have changed their stance.

711
00:49:39,561 --> 00:49:41,521
We did it.

712
00:49:41,521 --> 00:49:44,671
- Thank God.
 - That's how it should be.

713
00:49:44,671 --> 00:49:46,801
This man—

714
00:49:46,801 --> 00:49:49,601
- Why?
 - Who is it?

715
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:52,771
The perpetrator of Artist Sin Dae Ryuk's case.

716
00:49:52,771 --> 00:49:55,331
 Artist Sin Dae Ryuk (Perpetrator) 

717
00:49:55,331 --> 00:49:57,281
Answer it.

718
00:50:04,580 --> 00:50:06,441
I'm really sorry! I'm sorry!

719
00:50:06,441 --> 00:50:09,091
- Why are you doing this? 
 - It's fine.

720
00:50:09,860 --> 00:50:13,271
Why on earth did you do it? You didn't even answer our calls!

721
00:50:13,271 --> 00:50:15,461
You put us in a difficult situation.

722
00:50:15,461 --> 00:50:19,681
- I didn't write that post because I wanted to. 
 - What?

723
00:50:19,681 --> 00:50:24,621
They said the company wouldn't make a big deal out of it and asked me this favor.

724
00:50:24,621 --> 00:50:26,101
What do you mean, a favor? From whom?

725
00:50:26,101 --> 00:50:27,411
Well, that's...

726
00:50:27,411 --> 00:50:31,181
 Apology Letter 

727
00:50:32,421 --> 00:50:36,911
 It's all my fault. The rumors regarding Artist Sin Dae Ryuk are all false... 

728
00:50:43,590 --> 00:50:45,841
Is this the best you can do?

729
00:50:45,841 --> 00:50:49,381
You should've made sure he'd keep his mouth shut!

730
00:50:49,381 --> 00:50:53,531
-  You should've dealt with things so the company didn't have to!  
 - What?

731
00:50:53,531 --> 00:50:55,461
 Neon's legal team is taking action! 

732
00:50:55,461 --> 00:50:58,531
Why would Neon's legal team take—

733
00:51:01,330 --> 00:51:03,261
Hang up for a sec.

734
00:51:15,660 --> 00:51:18,831
Are you the one who personally instructed the legal team?

735
00:51:18,831 --> 00:51:22,311
Yes. I didn't think it was something that should be prolonged.

736
00:51:22,311 --> 00:51:25,801
I mean, it had to do with a mere artist,

737
00:51:25,801 --> 00:51:30,611
so don't you think there's no reason for the company to take a risk by getting involved?

738
00:51:33,390 --> 00:51:35,461
I'm not sure.

739
00:51:35,461 --> 00:51:40,451
The value I saw in that artist and the value you saw

740
00:51:40,451 --> 00:51:41,851
seem to be different.

741
00:51:41,851 --> 00:51:44,141
Then you should've told me in advance!

742
00:51:44,141 --> 00:51:47,151
Why should I have to tell you that?

743
00:51:47,151 --> 00:51:49,671
To you, no less.

744
00:51:57,470 --> 00:52:00,821
So you're saying he wrote it because someone asked him to, right?

745
00:52:00,821 --> 00:52:02,331
Yes.

746
00:52:03,300 --> 00:52:04,360
Did you record him?

747
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:06,390
Yes.

748
00:52:06,390 --> 00:52:09,711
Okay, how's Artist Sin Dae Ryuk?

749
00:52:09,711 --> 00:52:14,641
We still haven't received a manuscript from him.

750
00:52:14,641 --> 00:52:17,731
"Peeve Weapon" can't afford to waver.

751
00:52:17,731 --> 00:52:22,211
If there's no manuscript, that means there'll be a break. The responses will be bad.

752
00:52:22,211 --> 00:52:27,631
That's right. And it might cause a misunderstanding because of that incident.

753
00:52:28,650 --> 00:52:34,174
I'll go to his studio today and have a good talk with him.

754
00:52:34,174 --> 00:52:36,031
You've done well.

755
00:52:54,620 --> 00:52:56,711
PD On Ma Eum.

756
00:53:06,220 --> 00:53:11,631
You're probably worried about what to say to Artist Sin, right?

757
00:53:11,631 --> 00:53:12,981
Yes.

758
00:53:12,981 --> 00:53:17,791
The job of an editor and PD...

759
00:53:17,791 --> 00:53:19,471
Making 10 out of one,

760
00:53:19,471 --> 00:53:24,781
and raising that 10 to 100 is the job of an editor.

761
00:53:24,781 --> 00:53:26,251
However,

762
00:53:26,251 --> 00:53:31,241
creating one from zero is all up to the artist.

763
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:34,481
If the artist can't create one out of zero,

764
00:53:34,481 --> 00:53:40,361
no matter which famous PD is by his side, it's no use.

765
00:53:43,780 --> 00:53:45,891
When an artist loses self-confidence

766
00:53:45,891 --> 00:53:50,961
and has to draw something in a situation where they're unsure of anything,

767
00:53:50,961 --> 00:53:53,631
those miserable times...

768
00:53:54,750 --> 00:53:57,221
are probably impossible for us to even imagine.

769
00:54:01,190 --> 00:54:06,081
Try talking it out once more with Artist Sin Dae Ryuk.

770
00:54:06,081 --> 00:54:07,551
Okay.

771
00:54:17,390 --> 00:54:20,331
You're really disappointed in me, aren't you?

772
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:23,911
I'm still expecting great things, too.

773
00:54:31,331 --> 00:54:33,461
Would you like to come in?

774
00:54:33,461 --> 00:54:36,561
No, I'll just end up disturbing his peace.

775
00:54:36,561 --> 00:54:42,391
D-Dae Ryuk finally ate your food after a few days.

776
00:54:42,391 --> 00:54:45,401
That's such a relief!

777
00:54:45,401 --> 00:54:47,751
I should've brought more.

778
00:54:51,371 --> 00:54:52,971
Please...

779
00:54:52,971 --> 00:54:56,021
Please take good care of my Dae Ryuk.

780
00:55:02,581 --> 00:55:07,961
You should enjoy the food, too.

781
00:55:07,961 --> 00:55:09,883
All right.

782
00:55:39,171 --> 00:55:42,406
Hey, what are you doing? Stop it!

783
00:55:42,406 --> 00:55:43,742
What are you doing?

784
00:55:43,742 --> 00:55:46,442
That woman brought this, didn't she?

785
00:55:49,816 --> 00:55:51,906
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

786
00:55:55,643 --> 00:55:58,206
PD On, now really isn't a good time.

787
00:55:58,206 --> 00:55:59,936
Why?

788
00:55:59,936 --> 00:56:02,646
That woman came here again.

789
00:56:02,646 --> 00:56:04,856
Your mother did?

790
00:56:09,216 --> 00:56:12,816
What can she possibly be thinking by coming here in this situation—

791
00:56:13,676 --> 00:56:16,406
I don't even want to know.

792
00:56:16,406 --> 00:56:18,426
I need to tell you something about your mother.

793
00:56:18,426 --> 00:56:22,296
- I said I don't want to know!
 - There's a reason...

794
00:56:23,466 --> 00:56:26,896
why your mother came looking for you after all this time.

795
00:56:29,056 --> 00:56:32,266
Your mother has Alzheimer's.

796
00:56:35,086 --> 00:56:36,816
And one more thing.

797
00:56:36,816 --> 00:56:39,856
There's something you're not aware of.

798
00:56:42,306 --> 00:56:44,286
What is it?

799
00:56:48,466 --> 00:56:53,736
A long time ago, she said there was a fire in your house.

800
00:56:59,396 --> 00:57:00,136
 - What's going on?
 - Did someone report it? 

801
00:57:00,136 --> 00:57:01,966
 Isn't that Dae Ryuk's house? 

802
00:57:01,966 --> 00:57:03,396
 So the kid's in there alone? 

803
00:57:03,396 --> 00:57:05,886
 - What do we do?
 - Is his mom not home? 

804
00:57:05,886 --> 00:57:08,226
 What are we going to do? 

805
00:57:08,226 --> 00:57:09,026
 What's going on? 

806
00:57:09,026 --> 00:57:10,956
 Dae Ryuk's mom! There's big trouble! There's big trouble! 

807
00:57:10,956 --> 00:57:13,916
 Your house is on fire! 

808
00:57:13,916 --> 00:57:16,966
 - My Dae Ryuk!
 - No, you can't go in right now! 

809
00:57:16,966 --> 00:57:19,406
 - You can't go in!
 - Don't go in! 

810
00:57:19,406 --> 00:57:20,986
 Dae Ryok's mother! 

811
00:57:20,986 --> 00:57:22,176
 What do we do? 

812
00:57:22,176 --> 00:57:24,416
 Dae Ryuk! 

813
00:57:24,416 --> 00:57:26,426
 Dae Ryuk! 

814
00:57:28,186 --> 00:57:29,846
 Dae Ryuk, hold on! 

815
00:57:29,846 --> 00:57:31,906
 It's Mom! 

816
00:57:35,706 --> 00:57:38,176
 Dae Ryuk! 

817
00:57:38,176 --> 00:57:40,256
 D-Dae Ryuk! 

818
00:57:41,446 --> 00:57:43,876
 Are you okay? 

819
00:57:44,646 --> 00:57:47,026
 My sketchbook... 

820
00:57:47,026 --> 00:57:48,816
 Okay. 

821
00:57:50,696 --> 00:57:52,666
 Ow, it's hot! 

822
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:09,300
 Don't go near the kitchen. Do you know? 

823
00:58:21,996 --> 00:58:24,816
 I'll be back soon after work, 

824
00:58:24,816 --> 00:58:30,166
 so eat here, and read your comics. 

825
00:58:30,166 --> 00:58:32,826
 I'll be back soon, okay? 

826
00:59:02,456 --> 00:59:07,716
Why didn't you tell him about that?

827
00:59:07,716 --> 00:59:10,726
I'm not sure if it's because of the shock.

828
00:59:10,726 --> 00:59:14,646
Dae Ryuk has no memory of the fire.

829
00:59:14,646 --> 00:59:17,736
The accident was caused by him playing with fire,

830
00:59:17,736 --> 00:59:22,336
so I had no desire to tell him.

831
00:59:22,336 --> 00:59:24,256
But...

832
00:59:25,136 --> 00:59:27,696
It's my fault.

833
00:59:28,546 --> 00:59:34,066
Leaving that young child alone like that.

834
00:59:35,066 --> 00:59:38,386
There's nothing wrong with his resentment.

835
00:59:39,036 --> 00:59:42,816
It doesn't change the fact that I'm a bad mom.

836
00:59:42,816 --> 00:59:46,190
I know I won't be forgiven.

837
00:59:46,836 --> 00:59:51,576
But as his mom...

838
00:59:52,936 --> 00:59:56,056
while my memory is still intact,

839
00:59:57,616 --> 01:00:00,666
I wanted to see him at least one more time.

840
01:00:01,386 --> 01:00:03,346
I thought...

841
01:00:04,846 --> 01:00:09,696
I'd be able to remember him a bit longer by doing so.

842
01:00:10,356 --> 01:00:12,746
That was my greed.

843
01:00:16,381 --> 01:00:19,006
What can I do?

844
01:00:19,006 --> 01:00:20,269
Ma'am...

845
01:00:20,269 --> 01:00:23,349
I just hurt Dae Ryuk!

846
01:00:24,806 --> 01:00:25,936
What do I do...

847
01:00:25,936 --> 01:00:27,646
Lies.

848
01:00:28,426 --> 01:00:30,616
I don't remember that.

849
01:00:35,576 --> 01:00:38,526
I need to confirm it with her myself.

850
01:00:38,526 --> 01:00:39,636
What?

851
01:00:39,636 --> 01:00:42,046
I can't send her off like this.

852
01:00:42,716 --> 01:00:44,896
I'll give her a call.

853
01:00:49,046 --> 01:00:51,766
Ma'am, where are you?

854
01:00:57,206 --> 01:00:59,676
 I should go now. 

855
01:01:00,693 --> 01:01:03,726
 I leave Dae Ryuk in your care. 

856
01:01:03,726 --> 01:01:07,856
 And thank you for everything, PD On. 

857
01:01:17,186 --> 01:01:19,836
Sir, please go to the express bus terminal.

858
01:01:19,836 --> 01:01:22,146
As fast as you can.

859
01:01:25,896 --> 01:01:28,386
 Express Bus Terminal 

860
01:01:30,186 --> 01:01:32,736
 This is an announcement from the express bus terminal. 

861

863
01:01:39,036 --> 01:01:41,006
 Thank you. 

864
01:02:06,286 --> 01:02:09,696
Sir, I'm sorry, but could you go a little faster?

865
01:02:14,270 --> 01:02:16,970
 The moment you become weak the monster will devour you. 

866
01:02:19,690 --> 01:02:22,760
  Dramatization of Genius Artist Sin Dae Ryuks work directed by Sin Ji Won.

 A strange encounter 

868
01:02:27,750 --> 01:02:30,946
 The moment you become weak, the monster will devour you.

 Ticketing  -----  Boarding 

874
01:03:03,593 --> 01:03:04,976
Excuse me.

875
01:03:04,976 --> 01:03:06,856
Excuse me.

876
01:03:30,986 --> 01:03:33,176
Where do you get on the bus heading to Jangwon?

877
01:03:33,176 --> 01:03:35,266
Gate 7.

878
01:03:45,916 --> 01:03:48,186
Wait, wait...

879
01:04:00,846 --> 01:04:03,486
That can't be true, right?

880
01:04:05,096 --> 01:04:07,426
If that's true...

881
01:04:08,546 --> 01:04:10,436
If...

882
01:04:12,026 --> 01:04:14,416
If that's true...

883
01:04:17,006 --> 01:04:21,376
then who have I been hating...

884
01:04:23,476 --> 01:04:26,706
and fearing all this time?

885
01:04:59,556 --> 01:05:01,676
Is that you, Dae Ryuk?

886
01:05:14,246 --> 01:05:19,616
Was that really because of me?

887
01:05:23,306 --> 01:05:25,996
I shouldn't have come.

888
01:05:25,996 --> 01:05:28,866
I only made it more difficult for you.

889
01:05:29,886 --> 01:05:32,706
I just wanted to see

890
01:05:32,706 --> 01:05:35,876
Dae Ryuk all grown up.

891
01:05:36,736 --> 01:05:38,466
So...

892
01:05:39,116 --> 01:05:43,646
since you saw me are you done?

893
01:05:45,306 --> 01:05:47,846
If you just leave like this.

894
01:05:47,846 --> 01:05:50,226
If you leave, that's the end?

895
01:05:50,936 --> 01:05:54,316
- It's not like that.
 - You can't go.

896
01:05:59,216 --> 01:06:02,046
I won't let you abandon me again.

897
01:06:07,186 --> 01:06:10,276
Get treatment if you're sick.

898
01:06:10,276 --> 01:06:16,666
Don't think of running away and just get treated!

899
01:06:20,576 --> 01:06:22,476
I'm sorry.

900
01:06:44,836 --> 01:06:48,826
 He called me a god. 

901
01:06:49,713 --> 01:06:53,966
 However if anyone could become 

902
01:06:53,966 --> 01:06:57,416
 someone else's god... 

903
01:06:57,416 --> 01:07:00,880
 that would probably be their parents. 

904
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:02,880
I'm really sorry.

905
01:07:02,886 --> 01:07:08,365
 Since a child's world is created by his parents. 

906
01:07:24,330 --> 01:07:31,300

 Today's Webtoon

 Why didn't you tell me in advance? 

909
01:08:00,320 --> 01:08:04,740
 I always had judo. That's why I could be this strong right now. 

910
01:08:04,740 --> 01:08:10,180
 It was my honor to have served you as your last PD, Artist Baek. 

911
01:08:10,180 --> 01:08:11,730
 Thank you. 

912
01:08:11,730 --> 01:08:15,590
 Our ill-fated relationship is so strange. 

913
01:08:15,590 --> 01:08:18,300
 A report? 

914
01:08:18,300 --> 01:08:20,130
 I reported him. 

915
01:08:20,130 --> 01:08:22,570
 Jun Yeong. 

916
01:08:22,570 --> 01:08:24,680
 We decided to fight together to the end. 

917
01:08:24,700 --> 01:08:32,000
♫  Even if we stayed up through the long cold night  ♫
