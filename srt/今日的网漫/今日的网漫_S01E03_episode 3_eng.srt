1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:10,080


2
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:34,000
 Today's Webtoon 

3
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:43,170
Whom do we take off this list?

4
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:46,500
Do you have any artists in mind?

5
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:54,800
Isn't that a little aggressive? Will it be all right?

6
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,580
This is the way to learn quickly.

7
00:00:56,580 --> 00:01:00,430
It's much better than matching in vain a newbie artist with a newbie PD.

8
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:03,010
Okay, let's do it.

9
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:04,230
I'm going to a meeting.

10
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:06,200
Okay, see you later.

11
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:11,950
Hello.

12
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:23,550
Oh, what is that? You bought mine too?

13
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:25,940
You're so sensible! Thanks for the drink.

14
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:27,400
Sure.

15
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,550
What is this? It's so watery.

16
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:31,730
When did you buy this?

17
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:34,900
Oh, it melted. I'm sorry.

18
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:44,460
 Editor-in-Chief Jang Man Cheol and the editorial staff will be gone at the end of the year. 

19
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:48,510
 They said, if you work hard, they'll make you a permanent employee.  

20
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:50,800
 They cheated you, Ms. On Ma Eum. 

21
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:54,080
 They plan to get rid of you when your one-year contract is up. 

22
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:09,940
- Ma Eum?
- Yes?

23
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:12,920
If you are not busy, can you help me with finding references?

24
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:15,390
Oh, yes!

25
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:22,480
But what is a "reference"?

26
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,170
It's looking up sources for current webtoons that are in production.

27
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:28,070
Oh, yes, yes...

28
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:31,060
I received data from the production company.

29
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:32,940
I am forwarding it to you now.

30
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:34,710
All right.

31
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,990
What might "forwarding" be?

32
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:46,680
Email... I said I will send you an email.

33
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,360
Ah! Yes, yes.

34
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:58,960
Ma Eum. Can I see you for a second?

35
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,510
Sure.

36
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,370
It's a given that you may not know this if this is your first job,

37
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:15,870
but everyone is expecting you to just play along.

38
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:18,010
It's wrong that nobody told you.

39
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:21,000
No, I should've asked first.

40
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,480
I'll tell you everything, okay?

41
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:27,790
In the future ask me anything and everything if you don't know.

42
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:31,410
Everything?

43
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:35,380
Why? What do you want to know?

44
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:39,140
It's nothing, just...

45
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:42,920
I'm not sure if I'm doing a good job.

46
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,710
What are you talking about?

47
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:47,370
Ma Eum, you are doing great so far!

48
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:50,190
Just keep doing what you are doing now.

49
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:52,970
- Okay?
 - Thank you, PD Gi.

50
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:56,260
I'm serious. My gosh.

51
00:03:58,110 --> 00:03:59,920
500 KRW

52
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:06,460
What is this?

53
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:09,400
- Is it an emergency fund? 
 - It's a charm.

54
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,530
Lucky charm.

55
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:13,050
Charm?

56
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:14,690
Oh, yes.

57
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:19,060
You gave me this on the day I had an interview.

58
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:21,760
Oh, that's right. But you got rejected then.

59
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:25,290
But eventually, I got in, and I'm sitting here now.

60
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,390
Well, thank you for seeing it that way.

61
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:35,510
I think I'll need some luck from now on.

62
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:40,150
- Let's do it! 
 - Let's do it.

63
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,600
On Ma Eum and Gu Jun Yeong, you two have assigned artists.

64
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,320
On Ma Eum, we can have a brief meeting and

65
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:50,760
Gu Jun Yeong, PD Kwon Yeong Bae will hand over tasks.

66
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:54,950
I sent everything through messenger.

67
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:01,090
Artist Pomme

68
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:05,090
 Caution… 

69
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:07,770
 Doesn't like calling before texting. 

70
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:10,270
 End of transfer. 

71
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:14,510
Why?

72
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:20,980
 I knew it. 

73
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:23,320
 Escaping this team is the answer. 

74
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,870
Here it is.

75
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:31,250
 Artist Na Gang Nam 

76
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,610
Me...

77
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,030
Me?

78
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:43,750
- I'm managing Artist Na Gang Nam?
 - Yes.

79
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:45,390
- Do you like it?
 - Yes!

80
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:48,090
I'm a superfan of "Gumiho Princess"!

81
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:50,530
If I become the PD, then I'll be the first reader, right?

82
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:51,650
This is so crazy!

83
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:54,610
I'm not assigning you to be the first reader.

84
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:56,610
Don't get too excited.

85
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:58,430
That's right.

86
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:00,920
I will evaluate calmly and objectively going forward.

87
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:05,540
I'm not asking you to become a calm and objective critic, either.

88
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:09,570
Then, I'll help the artist with all my strength

89
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:13,840
All your strength? Even moreso I'm not asking you to side with him all the time!

90
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:16,510
It's difficult, right?

91
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:17,800
Yes.

92
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,800
That's typical for this job.

93
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:27,490
Then, what is a genuine editor?

94
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:29,060
In one word?

95
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,960
That's what you have to find out.

96
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,420
Oh, me?

97
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:38,390
Me… I see.

98
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:43,480
Starting next month, send me your answer each and every month, you got it?

99
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:45,950
Yes, sir.

100
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,530
 Na Gang Nam, "Gumiho Princess," Works from 2 p.m. - 4 a.m., No texting before noon...  
He's a veteran and should be fine, but  

101
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:52,990
you still need to be on your toes.

102
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:54,690
Don't rely on the artist so much.

103
00:06:54,690 --> 00:07:00,190
Rather try to become a PD that the artist can lean on, okay?

104
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:02,920
You are awesome, Deputy Editor.

105
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:05,990
Yes! What did you just say?

106
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:09,410
"Artists can lean on…" Okay, "Artists can lean on..."

107
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:13,540
So awesome.

108
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:15,450
 2021-2022 Sales Ratio 

109
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:17,530
 2022 Performance Report 

110
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,380
Webtoon team sales are better than last month.

111
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:28,290
Yes, so... when Artist Baek Eo Jin came back from the break,

112
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:30,770
the drawing quality improved, which resulted

113
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:33,710
in a huge increase in revenue from users.

114
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:39,110
He never missed deadlines so taking a break became a newsworthy issue

115
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:41,390
and our platform was publicized.

116
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:43,570
That's great.

117
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:46,830
It would be great if this trend could continue into the future.

118
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:49,900
We'll try to keep going up!

119
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:54,490
Yes, yes...

120
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:56,810
Oh, boy.

121
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,090
- Did something good happen at the meeting? 
 - Oh, no.

122
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:08,160
Oh, no.

123
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:15,450
Our "Monsters" rookie hit a home run as his first batter up.

124
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:21,480
Our team rookies should hit a home run too.

125
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,930
On Ma Eum, Gu Jun Yeong.

126
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:26,280
I have high expectations.

127
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,640
PD Gu Jun Yeong, your first artist is Pomme, right?

128
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,790
How about it? Are you happy with that?

129
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:33,000
No.

130
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,390
"No." I knew it.

131
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:41,130
Everyone has a hard time with that artist.

132
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:45,190
Nothing serious happened, right?

133
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:49,640
- Team Leader. 
 - Yeah?

134
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:52,780
I have something to share with you in private.

135
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:54,680
Right now?

136
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:57,430
Transfer to a different team?

137
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:01,760
The work doesn't suit you?

138
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:03,910
No.

139
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:05,560
Really?

140
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:08,600
You made that conclusion after just one month.

141
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:11,850
I reached that conclusion much earlier.

142
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,970
I'm just telling you now.

143
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:16,910
Really?

144
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:18,340
That's a shame.

145
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:23,120
When a talented person like Gu Jun Yeong joined our team, I was really happy.

146
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:27,250
Okay, I will find out the process from HR.

147
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:30,130
I already asked HR.

148
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:32,110
Instead of me requesting the transfer,

149
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:38,110
they said there's a higher chance of processing quickly if you transfer me.

150
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:40,410
You already looked into it.

151
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:43,580
Which team do you want to go to?

152
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:46,080
Service planning team. If not,

153
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,920
I'd like to go to any other service team.

154
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:51,580
As long as it's not our department, right?

155
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:56,670
I see.

156
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:01,000
I'll look into it since you want it, but

157
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,630
- Jun Yeong, the company is not a university. 
 - What?

158
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:09,720
Just because you don't like the job doesn't mean you can withdraw and retake the course easily.

159
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:13,300
It's not a place like that.

160
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:20,620
All right, anyway I'll find out from HR.

161
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:24,980
Before the transfer is finalized, keep it a secret from other team members.

162
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:29,330
And I hope you do your best on your assigned tasks.

163
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:30,880
Yes, sir!

164
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,900
- Jun Yeong!
 - Yes?

165
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:43,690
"You will not arrive in paradise when you run away."

166
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:46,920
- Do you know that saying? 
 - No.

167
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,730
Of course, you don't.

168
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:52,070
It's from a very popular manhwa...

169
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,330
I just thought of it.

170
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:06,280
Is he saying that I'm running away?

171
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:12,950
 Episode 3: You will not arrive in paradise when you run away. 

172
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:14,200
 Hello, Artist Na! 

173
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,360
 I'm On Ma Eum. We've met before. 

174
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,720
 I've been assigned to manage your work. 

175
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,660
 If it's okay, can I stop by later today to say hello? 

176
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:28,840
He won't give it...

177
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:31,820
 No, I'm busy. 

178
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:49,690
 You are busy finishing up, right? 

179
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:52,800
 Then, fighting, Artist Na! I'll wait for the manuscripts. 

180
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,010
If you know I'm busy, then stop contacting me.

181
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:04,950
 The door is closing. 

182
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:07,060
 I heard you are my PD starting today. 

183
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,710
 Aren't you coming to my studio? 

184
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:11,080
 We should make a formal introduction. 

185
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,460
Yes, of course.

186
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:14,650
I have to go if you say so.

187
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:30,940
You are here.

188
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,420
Can you move these packages inside?

189
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:38,540
Oh, that's right.

190
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:41,190
You are going to say it's power tripping, right?

191
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:52,640
Go inside. I'll do it.

192
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:07,700
 Exhausted, out of breath, jeez, s*** 

193
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:30,210
Drink this. You worked hard.

194
00:13:57,730 --> 00:14:00,330
You did a good job on your interior decoration.

195
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:04,520
I work over 16 hours a day 365 days a year.

196
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:07,050
I try to make the house pretty.

197
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:10,300
- I also bought a classy water purifier. 
 - I see.

198
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:12,470
I have no spare time to go shopping.

199
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:14,550
So internet shopping is my only hobby.

200
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:17,310
Just so I can feel the seasons change.

201
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:22,350
I can wear undergarments anytime at home, so I order more of them.

202
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:26,260
There are more times when I don't even wear any.

203
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:38,460
Do you have an illness?

204
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:41,140
Disc in the back.

205
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:42,490
Disc in the neck.

206
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:44,880
Pain in shoulder blades, sciatica,

207
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,340
chronic migraine, reflux esophagitis,

208
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:49,770
wrist tendonitis, carpal tunnel syndrome.

209
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:52,690
There's more, but let's stop here.

210
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:56,190
At that level, perhaps you shouldn't work at all.

211
00:14:56,190 --> 00:14:59,050
Most webtoon artists work with this many pains and aches.

212
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:01,710
It's that much of an extreme job.

213
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:06,420
 Cabbage Juice 

214
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:19,110
I'm the reason you were assigned to me.

215
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:22,230
- I request changing PDs regularly. 
 - Why?

216
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:25,310
PD Kwon Yeong Bae was slow with his feedback, and

217
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:29,040
I have meetings at home and I didn't like PD Kwon coming over.

218
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,490
Then, you can meet outside.

219
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:31,880
I didn't want to do that either.

220
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:34,490
It's exhausting being recognized by people.

221
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:37,530
You thought I have "celebrity disease" (snobbish with inflated ego), right?

222
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:41,390
Somehow everyone recognizes me and wants me to take a photo with them.

223
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:45,230
And they tag me on their social media, and they cuss at me.

224
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:48,540
"She thinks she's so hot and famous, blah, blah..."

225
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:53,460
I heard other artists use internet messenger to communicate.

226
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:57,730
What's the reason you called me to meet you at your house?

227
00:15:57,730 --> 00:15:59,840
To boss me around?

228
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:02,550
Because I'm lonely.

229
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:07,150
I have no friends and no close artists.

230
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:10,460
I mostly text my assistants too.

231
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:15,490
If it weren't for moments like this, when would I meet face to face with someone?

232
00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:18,870
Is it annoying?

233
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:22,400
Then I won't ask you over anymore.

234
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:24,680
No, it's not that.

235
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:29,400
If this is part of my job, I'll do my best while it's my duty.

236
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:41,080
- You don't have to walk me out. 
 - No, it's not that.

237
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,260
Can you throw out boxes on your way out?

238
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:46,230
While you're at it.

239
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,300
I'm really...

240
00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:58,340
going to quit if I don't get transferred to a different team.

241
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:15,850
 "Gumiho Princess" - 3 days before the deadline 

242
00:17:15,850 --> 00:17:17,930
I'm so excited...

243
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:22,490
I can't believe I'm the first person to see Artist Na's manuscript!

244
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:24,910
- Wow... 
- Wow.

245
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:27,600
There's someone who thinks just like me.

246
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,490
When I interviewed for the webtoon PD opening,

247
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:32,410
I said I applied to see webtoon a day before anybody else.

248
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:34,200
- That's what I said.
 - Really?

249
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,560
So I almost got rejected.

250
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:39,940
You have to be on top of Artist Na's deadline, okay?

251
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:41,900
It's not that easy.

252
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:45,690
Yes, sir!

253
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:51,070
- Let's eat more.
 - Okay.

254
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:58,080
Are you on top of Artist Na's deadlines?

255
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,070
Yes, I'm taking good care of it.

256
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:01,770
That's right.

257
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:05,310
 "Gumiho Princess" - 2 days before the deadline 

258
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:08,780
You are on top of Artist Na's deadlines, right?

259
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:10,440
Yes, yes, yes.

260
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:14,920
Artist Na's deadlines. You really have to be on top of it.

261
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,480
Do you understand?

262
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:19,820
-Yes.
 - Okay.

263
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:33,040
 "Gumiho Princess" - 1 day before the deadline 

264
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:47,720
 Han Seul 

265
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:53,970
 Han Seul 

266
00:18:56,690 --> 00:18:58,360
 Han Seul 

267
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:22,830
 Han Seul 

268
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:32,790
Han Seul...

269
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:35,740
Han Seul?

270
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:38,800
Han Seul?

271
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:45,080
Han Seul.

272
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,950
Han Seul?

273
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,980
 I'm leaving... 

274
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:12,230
 Far, far away. 

275
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,910
 Deadline D-day 

276
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:20,950
It's about time to receive the manuscripts...

277
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:24,910
Why is he not sending it to me?

278
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:29,440
 Artist Na, today's the deadline. 

279
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,100
 Are you almost done? 

280
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:33,580
 I don't want to interrupt since you are busy. 

281
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:36,210
 So I'm texting instead of calling. 

282
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:42,410
 He's not reading them. 

283
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:49,600
- The Gumiho manuscript isn't here yet? 
 - Not yet.

284
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,870
You are managing Artist Na's schedule well, right?

285
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:55,590
Of course, when I contacted him recently,

286
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:57,730
he said he was working hard to complete it.

287
00:20:57,730 --> 00:21:00,540
That's what he said, but...

288
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,380
We have to upload it at 11.

289
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:05,890
Artist Na's previews have all been used up.

290
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:08,100
If we don't receive it by 10, then

291
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:11,400
it's really a cancellation, you know that?

292
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:13,980
Yes.

293
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:32,110
I'm going to visit Artist Na's studio now.

294
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:34,590
- I'll be back.
 - Yes, sure.

295
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:56,510
Oh, Han Seul?

296
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:59,200
Han Seul! Han Seul!

297
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,870
Han Seul!

298
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:03,580
- Han Seul!
 - Hello, Artist Na!

299
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:05,440
What is it? On Mandu (Ma Eum's nickname)?

300
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,890
Today's the deadline, but I couldn't get in touch with you—

301
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:10,730
I'll give it to you. Don't worry!

302
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:16,080
Are you okay?

303
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,630
My girlfriend left the house again at dawn.

304
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:25,040
I was looking for her all day.

305
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:28,590
Do you know where she went?

306
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:33,090
There are a couple of hotels in Seoul she stays at when she leaves.

307
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:37,830
I checked, but she's nowhere to be found this time.

308
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:41,250
Where did she go again?

309
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:46,390
 Wondering where I am? 

310
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:47,720
 Where do you think I am? 

311
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:50,040
Hey, Ji Han Seul! Where are you?

312
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,720
No, no, Artist Na!

313
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:54,940
- You have to finish work first.
 - Suspend it!

314
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:01,110
No, we can't suspend!

315
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:04,670
Artist Na, you are our main webtoon artist.

316
00:23:04,670 --> 00:23:08,270
If you take a break for a day, the number of our webtoon visitors will decrease.

317
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:10,410
Once readers leave, they don't come back easily.

318
00:23:10,410 --> 00:23:13,010
You know that, don't you?

319
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,970
- Seriously! 
 - Artist Na!

320
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:21,280
You are not an amateur, but a pro.

321
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,890
Professionals prioritize promises.

322
00:23:23,890 --> 00:23:27,930
What do you know about professionals?

323
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:30,760
I know.

324
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:32,820
To keep the promise as a pro athlete,

325
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:36,950
I've finished competing with a torn ligament.

326
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:44,620
 Hi everyone, I'm now at... 

327
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:46,980
I'll go find her.

328
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:48,170
Your girlfriend.

329
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:49,580
- What?
 - Right now!

330
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:51,010
How... How?

331
00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:57,120
By whatever it takes, I'll find your girlfriend by tonight.

332
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,020
Can you please finish the work?

333
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:02,010
I have to send the file by 10.

334
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:05,860
There are only a few hours left.

335
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:08,230
- I have to draw more than ten scenes. 
 - No, no, no.

336
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:13,200
Artist Na, you've been the best pro artist for the past five years.

337
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,890
Artist Na, you can do it.

338
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:20,180
I can't allow a suspension during the first week of my job.

339
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:23,440
Artist Na, I beg you. Please.

340
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:26,390
Fine.

341
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:29,370
I will do what I can with my assistant. You have to keep your promise though.

342
00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:31,410
- What?
 - The promise that you will find my girlfriend.

343
00:24:31,410 --> 00:24:34,320
What? A professional prioritizes promises. That's what you said, right?

344
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,230
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

345
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:38,390
I'll go, I'll go right now and find her.

346
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:40,480
I will by any means.

347
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,410
Fighting!

348
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,100
 PD On Ma Eum 

349
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:08,790
I'll get going now.

350
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:12,000
Okay, good job today. Bye now.

351
00:25:13,410 --> 00:25:16,400
Gumiho still hasn't come through yet?

352
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,850
It should be here soon.

353
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:20,210
On Ma Eum is at Artist Na's studio.

354
00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:23,380
Just because she's at the studio doesn't mean the manuscript will be ready.

355
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:26,840
- His girlfriend left the house again, right? 
 - Yes.

356
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:29,690
Why does she leave near the deadline every time?

357
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:31,530
I'm so sick of it.

358
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:33,150
Tell them to just break up.

359
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:36,200
We can't do anything about that.

360
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,730
Hyung. Go on home.

361
00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:41,480
I will make sure to avoid suspension.

362
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,200
Are you sure?

363
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:45,340
Yes.

364
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:47,550
She will do a good job.

365
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,030
All right.

366
00:25:56,150 --> 00:25:59,800
Hyung, don't worry too much and get home safe.

367
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,490
Are you asking where I am?

368
00:26:10,490 --> 00:26:13,360
Where do you think I am?

369
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,460
I'm at a hotel.

370
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:17,600
With an oceanview window!

371
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,970
Stop for a moment.

372
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:26,320
You're pretty sharp with your eyes there.

373
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:31,870
Hold on. It looks like a hotel that can be seen from a sushi restaurant.

374
00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:34,040
I can't tell which sushi restaurant this is.

375
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:37,670
Where could this be...

376
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:39,590
Oh, daebak.

377
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:42,440
Looks like she went to that sushi restaurant.

378
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:46,050
I still can't tell which sushi restaurant this is because I can't see the name.

379
00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:49,470
- There are lots of grilled clam places.
 - Wait.

380
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:57,940
Search Haenamhae Grilled Clams.

381
00:26:57,940 --> 00:27:00,740
- Haenamhae?
 - Haenamhae Grilled Clams.

382
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:03,930
Were you waiting for me?

383
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:07,630
How does it feel to finish your first assignment as a PD?

384
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:11,470
Pomme finishes her work on time like a sharp knife. It shouldn't have been too difficult.

385
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:12,950
Yes.

386
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:17,970
Team Leader, what about my transfer request?

387
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,440
Do you want to have a drink with me?

388
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:26,280
I asked about your transfer with HR, but...

389
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:28,170
Yes?

390
00:27:28,170 --> 00:27:30,750
They said I can reject it.

391
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:35,210
- So, I am going to reject it. 
 - Pardon?

392
00:27:35,210 --> 00:27:38,850
I am not going to send you to a different team.

393
00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:42,630
Objectively speaking, I'm currently no help to the team.

394
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:44,250
I don't know anything about comics, and

395
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:48,180
I am just about to finish reading Neon webtoons.

396
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:51,090
You know yourself well.

397
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:06,480
 8 p.m. | Hana Monsters 
  Wow. Aigoo...

398
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:10,150
On Ma Eum is having a very difficult time with her first deadline.

399
00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:12,140
You really care about On Ma Eum.

400
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:15,450
She tries her best on everything and at full throttle,

401
00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:18,540
so how can I not appreciate her?

402
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:20,940
How come you are not like that, Gu Jun Yeong?

403
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:24,350
You said you don't know anything about comics, but you don't do anything.

404
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:26,290
You don't even try.

405
00:28:26,290 --> 00:28:28,830
Yet you ask for a transfer.

406
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:31,150
You are smart, Gu Jun Yeong.

407
00:28:31,150 --> 00:28:32,960
If you take one or two hours every day after work,

408
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:36,020
you can catch up quickly if you read just a few famous comics.

409
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:38,970
You can even read them when you have time at work.

410
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:49,390
I asked HR.

411
00:28:49,390 --> 00:28:53,010
I asked if they sent you to our team by error or something.

412
00:28:53,010 --> 00:28:54,710
But they said it's absolutely not the case.

413
00:28:54,710 --> 00:28:59,140
Then, I have no reason to send you to a different department.

414
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:04,190
Helping you learn something is more beneficial for the company.

415
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:08,060
For now, try your best to focus.

416
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:10,860
Then, you'll see the next stage.

417
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:12,700
There's nothing in this world that is worthless.

418
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:16,860
Even leftover drinking snacks can become tasty stew when recooked well.

419
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:20,440
But I'm not a leftover.

420
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:23,350
- What?
 - "Try your best at work.

421
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:26,370
Then you will see the next stage."

422
00:29:26,370 --> 00:29:28,420
Are you sure about that?

423
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:31,940
Then what is it that you want to say?

424
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:37,240
I heard the Webtoon Service Team may be gone after one year.

425
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,710
 What if the team is gone after I give my all? 

426
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:47,150
 Who's going to be responsible for my one year? 

427
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:53,740
 Never mind me. 

428
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:58,200
 How about On Ma Eum, who's running around to become a full-time employee? 

429
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:01,030
You keep saying "try your best" without any context, but

430
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:04,170
I don't bet on something that has no chance.

431
00:30:04,170 --> 00:30:05,800
Oh, really?

432
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,490
Hey.

433
00:30:07,490 --> 00:30:11,920
Do we look like a hopeless gambling table to you?

434
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:14,130
Okay, fine.

435
00:30:14,130 --> 00:30:15,640
Let's just say that is the case.

436
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:17,350
Like you said, Gu Jun Yeong,

437
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:20,680
if we don't show good performance this year, I will probably get laid off.

438
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:23,480
In the worst case, all the PDs I brought in with me for the editorial team

439
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:26,530
can be laid off at once.

440
00:30:26,530 --> 00:30:28,530
But Gu Jun Yeong.

441
00:30:28,530 --> 00:30:30,670
Not you, Gu Jun Yeong.

442
00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:34,420
You're the only hired employee in our department.

443
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:38,560
An elite employee who was well-known throughout the company since the day you got hired.

444
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:44,140
If they form a new webtoon team or even if they bring in a third-party team,

445
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:46,730
who's going to be the central figure in that team?

446
00:30:46,730 --> 00:30:49,030
It's you, Gu Jun Yeong!

447
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:55,410
The company sent you to our team to suck all the know-how out of us.

448
00:30:56,170 --> 00:30:58,580
Don't you get it?

449
00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:00,040
Wow, look at this.

450
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:03,420
I thought you were smart, but not really.

451
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:07,910
Or you are still a chick that couldn't hatch from the egg.

452
00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:13,730
Who will be responsible if you try your best at work?

453
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:19,780
If you try your best at work, then your surroundings change.

454
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:24,380
You don't know the pleasure in that yet.

455
00:31:29,810 --> 00:31:34,550
For now, break out of that shallow shell of your pride.

456
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,970
How about coloring? It's done yet?

457
00:31:48,970 --> 00:31:50,870
It's almost done. I'll send the completed ones first.

458
00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:52,620
Cham Gil, how about the background?

459
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:54,010
Two more to go!

460
00:31:54,010 --> 00:31:56,280
I'll send it in one minute. One minute.

461
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:58,950
What kind of glory am I looking for in all this? Seriously...

462
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:01,650
Gosh, I'm sweating.

463
00:32:04,270 --> 00:32:06,070
Yes, On Ma Eum. The manuscript's not ready yet?

464
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:08,670
 Artist Na said he will send it in on time. 

465
00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:10,700
Wh-Where are you right now?

466
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:13,390
I'm on my way to find Artist Na's girlfriend.

467
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:14,300
What?

468
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:19,190
Artist Na kept saying he was going out to find her, so I'm going to find her for him.

469
00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:22,600
Did the manuscript not come through yet?

470
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:24,220
I will contact Artist Na again.

471
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:26,230
 Hey, are you kidding me! 

472
00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:29,330
 Why do you do whatever you want, On Ma Eum! 

473
00:32:29,330 --> 00:32:33,290
You should've reported to me if something like this happened!

474
00:32:33,290 --> 00:32:35,070
I'm sorry, Deputy Editor.

475
00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:38,430
How, when, and where are you going to find her at this hour?

476
00:32:38,430 --> 00:32:39,560
You don't even have a car.

477
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:41,670
 - I have a motor scooter.  
- What?

478
00:32:41,670 --> 00:32:43,710
Motor scooter?

479
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:47,770
Hey, s-someone can get hurt while doing that.

480
00:32:47,770 --> 00:32:49,940
I won't get hurt and will come back safe.

481
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:53,240
I'll especially bring back Ji Han Seul safe and sound.

482
00:32:54,470 --> 00:32:58,320
 - Okay, be careful driving. 
 - Okay, I'll be back safely.

483

 Congratulations! You have passed the file review for the recruitment at CK Group 

487
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:46,350
 Deputy Editor Seok Ji Hyeong 

488
00:33:47,210 --> 00:33:48,990
Yes, Deputy Editor.

489
00:33:48,990 --> 00:33:51,930
Hey, Jun Yeong.

490
00:33:51,930 --> 00:33:53,500
Hey.

491
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:55,670
You went home, right?

492
00:33:55,670 --> 00:33:57,910
No. Not yet.

493
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,480
You said you will bring Han Seul! What...

494
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,440
H-Hello. Who are you?

495
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:08,650
Hello, I'm a new hire, Gu Jun Yeong, from Neon's Webtoon Editorial Team.

496
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:12,200
- So?
- Deputy Editor Seok Ji Hyeong said he can't reach you,

497
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:13,840
so he asked me to come see you.

498
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:16,920
All right! I'll hurry up and give it to you!

499
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:28,570
You have to give us the file at least 30 minutes before uploading is due.

500
00:34:28,570 --> 00:34:30,870
Okay, I got it, geez!

501
00:34:37,770 --> 00:34:39,950
Oh, here.

502
00:34:39,950 --> 00:34:42,270
I thought your wrist probably hurts.

♫  I will take your hands and won't let go  ♫

507
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:21,130
♫  No need to say the words cause you know  ♫

520
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:07,220
I know this is the place.

♫  I will always be with you  ♫

522
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:11,950
- Let's go.
 - I said no!

523
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:14,980
Let's go have one drink.

524
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:17,480
Geez. Don't yell.

525
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:19,110
Let me go! Come on!

526
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:20,420
Let it go!

527
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:22,170
Let this go!

528
00:36:22,170 --> 00:36:24,780
Let it go!

529
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:27,860
- I don't want to! 
- Come on.

530

♫  I will always be with you, my love  ♫

533
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:41,970
Artist Na, is it ready yet?

534
00:36:41,970 --> 00:36:44,630
It's done, done.

535
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:50,650
 PD Seok Ji Hyeong 

536
00:36:57,620 --> 00:36:58,510
 Email sent 

537
00:36:58,510 --> 00:37:00,050
- I sent it.
- What?

538
00:37:00,050 --> 00:37:02,760
I sent the manuscript.

539
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:06,370
- Hurry and pick up the phone. 
- Okay.

540
00:37:11,290 --> 00:37:12,600
Yes, Deputy Editor.

541
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,840
Jun Yeong, yes.

542
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:16,550
Yes, I confirmed it.

543
00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:18,870
Okay, good job. Thanks. See you tomorrow.

544
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:20,220
 Okay. 

545
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:21,820
Yes.

546
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:33,010
Do you know each other?

547
00:37:34,290 --> 00:37:36,500
Just hand her over to us.

548
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:47,150
What the?

549
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:54,010
You look pretty drunk. It would be better if you just leave.

550
00:38:00,430 --> 00:38:01,930
Come here.

551
00:38:27,170 --> 00:38:29,020
Does it hurt?

552
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:32,920
I'm okay without putting the patch on.

553
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:35,090
No way!

554
00:38:35,090 --> 00:38:36,880
You will suffer tomorrow.

555
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:39,150
But by the way,

556
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:41,650
do you remember?

557
00:38:41,650 --> 00:38:43,230
Who?

558
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:49,020
At Artist Na's house, I introduced myself.

559
00:38:49,770 --> 00:38:51,850
- Jjim Mandu?
 - Yes, yes, yes!

560
00:38:51,850 --> 00:38:54,900
My gosh! Jjim Mandu!

561
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:56,910
Yes!

562
00:38:56,910 --> 00:39:00,610
But what are you doing here?

563
00:39:00,610 --> 00:39:02,380
What's Oppa doing?

564
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:04,950
Artist Na has to meet the deadline.

565
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:08,310
Every day, it's deadline, deadline.

566
00:39:08,310 --> 00:39:10,100
I'm so sick of it!

567
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:12,480
I mean, isn't it too much?

568
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,830
I don't even remember going out on a formal date.

569
00:39:14,830 --> 00:39:16,270
But that "Gumiho Princess"…

570
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:17,830
When will it end?

571
00:39:17,830 --> 00:39:21,200
- Excuse me?
 - I wish that would end soon.

572
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:24,440
Everyone earned enough with that comic.

573
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:27,870
Can't we just finish and take a break?

574
00:39:39,350 --> 00:39:42,790
 Gumiho Princess 

575
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:45,380
It's uploaded, Artist Na.

576
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:47,020
Thank you for the hard work.

577
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:50,990
My life expectancy shortens every time there's a deadline. Seriously.

578
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:54,950
You too. Good job!

579
00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:56,720
Yes, sir.

580
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:04,190
On Mandu!

581
00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:05,180
On Mandu...

582
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:07,760
- On Ma Eum… Try calling her! 
- What?

583
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:10,810
That wicked Mandu said she'd find and bring back my girlfriend.

584
00:40:10,810 --> 00:40:15,840
Since I kept my promise not to miss the deadline, check if Mandu kept her promise too.

585
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,820
Okay.

586
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:19,650
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

587
00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:20,770
 Gumiho Princess 

588
00:40:20,770 --> 00:40:22,620
Gosh! Thank God!

589
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:24,990
It's uploaded safe and sound.

590
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:28,800
Wow, as expected... Artist Na.

591
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:31,620
How does he put in this much detail in such a short time?

592
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:33,530
The quality is just crazy.

593
00:40:33,530 --> 00:40:36,890
Honey. Is it that much fun?

594
00:40:36,890 --> 00:40:38,210
Absolutely!

595
00:40:38,210 --> 00:40:41,380
This is my favorite webtoon.

596
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:43,430
Han Seul, don't you read it?

597
00:40:43,430 --> 00:40:45,540
It's your boyfriend's work.

598
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:47,430
That's why I don't read them.

599
00:40:47,430 --> 00:40:48,910
Because I get jealous.

600
00:40:48,910 --> 00:40:51,000
Jealous? Of whom?

601
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:55,390
San Ha or whoever she is Gumiho Princess.

602
00:40:56,110 --> 00:41:00,510
It feels like Oppa loves her more than me.

603
00:41:00,510 --> 00:41:02,420
No way.

604
00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:06,440
That makes no sense!

605
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:08,710
Artist Na loves you so much!

606
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:11,560
Even today, he put the deadline on the back burner and wanted to go look for you.

607
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:14,170
I barely stopped him. That's why he's still there.

608
00:41:14,170 --> 00:41:16,580
- Really?
 - Yes.

609
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:23,150
So, can you go home with me?

610
00:41:23,150 --> 00:41:25,310
I made a promise with Artist Na.

611
00:41:25,310 --> 00:41:30,430
That if he didn't flake out, I would for sure bring back Han Seul.

612
00:41:36,790 --> 00:41:39,000
 Gu Jun Yeong 

613
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,940
Excuse me.

614
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:42,930
Yes, Jun Yeong?

615
00:41:42,930 --> 00:41:45,800
Did you find Artist Na's girlfriend?

616
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:47,120
Yes...

617
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:49,860
I found her, and I am with her.

618
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:52,400
Yes, we're planning to go back now.

619
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:56,400
Yes, she's nodding her head saying she's good.

620
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,450
Okay, we'll leave soon.

621
00:41:58,450 --> 00:42:00,920
Okay, I got it.

622
00:42:02,450 --> 00:42:04,940
- Let go!
 - Come on...

623
00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:08,430
Let's go. Come on, come on.

00:43:01,950 --> 00:43:04,840
You've been through a lot today.

646
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:09,280
Thank you so much!

647
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:11,130
I'm feeling so refreshed for the first time in a while.

648
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:14,220
It was totally fun! Seriously.

649
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:16,190
That's good.

650
00:43:16,190 --> 00:43:19,790
Then promise me that you will never leave the house.

651
00:43:20,690 --> 00:43:24,350
If you are bored, let's hang out together.

652
00:43:24,350 --> 00:43:25,930
I will give you a ride on a motor scooter.

653
00:43:25,930 --> 00:43:28,520
Or go to an Escape Room? I'm good with anything.

654
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:31,860
- Motor scooter?
 - Yes, promise me.

655
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:33,890
Promise!

656
00:43:33,890 --> 00:43:35,610
I love it!

657
00:43:35,610 --> 00:43:37,540
- Bye!
 - Get in safe.

658
00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:39,160
Bye.

659
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:51,220
 Artist Na, it's On Ma Eum. 

660
00:43:51,220 --> 00:43:53,730
 I kept my promise. 

661
00:44:05,490 --> 00:44:08,110
What if we perform well?

662
00:44:08,110 --> 00:44:09,800
What?

663
00:44:14,450 --> 00:44:17,110
You said the editorial team will be gone if we can't bring up our performance.

664
00:44:17,110 --> 00:44:18,950
What if we can perform well?

665
00:44:18,950 --> 00:44:21,830
Can this team keep going as is?

666
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:26,590
All right then.

667
00:44:26,590 --> 00:44:28,400
I will try harder.

668
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:31,160
Even if you laugh at me, Gu Jun Yeong.

669
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:35,010
I will do twice or three times better than now

670
00:44:35,010 --> 00:44:37,640
so that this team doesn't vanish.

671
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:41,430
Even if you may be abandoned after a year?

672
00:44:41,430 --> 00:44:42,960
Yes.

673
00:44:44,130 --> 00:44:46,950
Since we can change the future.

674
00:44:48,570 --> 00:44:51,920
Worrying about an uncertain tomorrow,

675
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:54,450
and shivering in fear and laying low

676
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:57,680
is definitely not my style.

677
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:00,220
If I dreamed about a guaranteed future in the first place,

678
00:45:00,220 --> 00:45:04,360
the Olympic gold medal wouldn't have been my goal.

679
00:45:07,170 --> 00:45:11,680
I will no longer say things like "Be strong" to you.

680
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:14,850
Whatever decision you make, it's yours to make.

681
00:45:14,850 --> 00:45:20,430
But don't you dare guarantee other people's future.

682
00:45:21,750 --> 00:45:27,050
Not just me, but everyone in the Editorial Department is doing their best.

683
00:45:27,050 --> 00:45:29,780
And they will continue going forward.

684
00:45:29,780 --> 00:45:31,400
All right then.

685
00:46:12,070 --> 00:46:14,840
- Good morning.
 - You startled me! What the heck?

686
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:16,120
I am sorry about yesterday.

687
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:19,250
I will report in a timely manner going forward.

688
00:46:21,890 --> 00:46:23,750
Okay, do that.

689
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:29,350
Great job meeting your first deadline.

690
00:46:29,350 --> 00:46:32,250
Did you get some sleep, PD On Ma Eum?

691
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:37,060
On...

692
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:40,120
Did you say PD?

693
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:42,510
One more time, please...

694
00:46:43,190 --> 00:46:44,390
What's wrong?

695
00:46:44,390 --> 00:46:46,600
PD...

696
00:46:52,290 --> 00:46:55,430
Put the ice pack on your neck. Cold compress.

697
00:46:56,570 --> 00:46:58,550
Thank you.

698
00:46:59,690 --> 00:47:01,740
Don't you have a monthly day off yet?

699
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:04,300
You can take a day off on days like today.

700
00:47:04,300 --> 00:47:06,000
Gosh, I got nothing to show for it.

701
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,900
I got chosen because of my physical strength.

702
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:10,570
I can't take a day off over things like this.

703
00:47:10,570 --> 00:47:14,420
Who told you that you've got nothing to show other than physical strength?

704
00:47:16,570 --> 00:47:19,910
It's just my thought.

705
00:47:19,910 --> 00:47:23,560
Why are you so gentle and humble?

706
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:26,240
This is not how you are.

707
00:47:32,690 --> 00:47:36,040
Perhaps, can I ask you something?

708
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:37,260
Sure.

709
00:47:37,260 --> 00:47:38,980
What is it?

710
00:47:39,770 --> 00:47:42,850
By chance after one year...

711
00:47:42,850 --> 00:47:43,720
Yeah?

712
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:44,750
Good morning.

713
00:47:44,750 --> 00:47:46,390
Hi, Jun Yeong.

714
00:47:46,390 --> 00:47:48,550
Everyone got here early.

715
00:47:48,550 --> 00:47:49,880
You did great yesterday.

716
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:51,500
Not at all.

717
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:53,720
You went through a lot because of me yesterday.

718
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:55,350
Thank you so much.

719
00:47:55,350 --> 00:47:58,300
I didn't do anything there, though.

720
00:47:58,300 --> 00:48:00,370
Enjoy and see you later.

721
00:48:08,650 --> 00:48:12,210
 CK Group Competency Interview at 3 p.m. 

722
00:48:14,230 --> 00:48:16,290
Does Jun Yeong have a lunch plan?

723
00:48:16,290 --> 00:48:18,420
He took the afternoon off and left.

724
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:21,080
Maybe he's going to an interview at a different company.

725
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:23,330
What? Did you hear something, PD?

726
00:48:23,330 --> 00:48:25,980
Can't you see that his heart is not in this company?

727
00:48:25,980 --> 00:48:28,720
Maybe it's our team, not the company.

728
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:32,660
Maybe he thought he'd work at the headquarters with style, but

729
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:34,220
he got demoted here. Did that give him a reality check?

730
00:48:34,220 --> 00:48:36,530
Why is coming to our team a demotion?

731
00:48:36,530 --> 00:48:38,610
It can be from Gu Jun Yeong's perspective.

732
00:48:38,610 --> 00:48:41,520
Since he was in the Service Planning Team during training.

733
00:48:44,770 --> 00:48:47,100
Do you know anything, Ma Eum?

734
00:48:47,100 --> 00:48:49,220
You two were hired at the same time.

735
00:48:50,550 --> 00:48:52,740
No, I don't really know.

736
00:48:52,740 --> 00:48:56,090
Geez, I expected a lot from him since people said he's an ace.

737
00:48:56,090 --> 00:48:57,690
Ace my a**.

738
00:48:57,690 --> 00:48:59,500
Is everyone an ace if they have a good educational background?

739
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:02,350
He knows nothing and has no interest in webtoons.

740
00:49:02,350 --> 00:49:04,380
Just eat.

741
00:49:05,050 --> 00:49:07,840
Ajumma, can we have more radish kimchi juice?

742
00:49:18,750 --> 00:49:21,720
 CK 

743
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:37,240
 Color your mundane daily life in neon colors with Neon Webtoon 

744
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:41,480
 If you try your best at work, then your surroundings change. 

745
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:45,290
 I will do twice or three times better than now 

746
00:49:45,290 --> 00:49:47,920
 so that this team doesn't vanish. 

747
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:51,770
 Even if you might be abandoned after a year? 

748
00:49:51,770 --> 00:49:53,370
 Yes. 

749
00:49:54,370 --> 00:49:57,200
 Since we can change the future. 

750
00:49:57,200 --> 00:50:01,230
 For now, break out of that shallow shell of your pride. 

751
00:50:35,550 --> 00:50:37,670
 Coming! 

752
00:50:37,670 --> 00:50:40,190
I'm here. I'm here.

753
00:50:40,190 --> 00:50:43,040
PD On is here.

754
00:50:50,630 --> 00:50:53,010
What brings you here, Jun Yeong?

755
00:50:54,510 --> 00:50:57,160
Is it possible to rent these?

756
00:50:57,910 --> 00:50:59,720
These...

757
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:02,140
Normally, you can't, but...

758
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:07,710
- We will allow it since I know who you are. 
 - What?

759
00:51:07,710 --> 00:51:10,530
You are not going to ghost after renting them, right?

760
00:51:10,530 --> 00:51:11,590
No.

761
00:51:11,590 --> 00:51:13,940
- I will read them quickly and return them.
 - Okay.

762
00:51:13,940 --> 00:51:16,330
Wow, this is a masterpiece.

763
00:51:16,330 --> 00:51:19,100
Why did you pick these?

764
00:51:19,100 --> 00:51:21,730
Because of that memo.

765
00:51:21,730 --> 00:51:23,540
I wrote that memo.

766
00:51:23,540 --> 00:51:25,770
It's my favorite quote.

767
00:51:25,770 --> 00:51:28,050
Team Leader told me that quote.

768
00:51:28,050 --> 00:51:30,990
I asked him to transfer me to a different team.

769
00:51:31,830 --> 00:51:34,970
But he said he's going to reject my request.

770
00:51:36,850 --> 00:51:38,480
Then...

771
00:51:39,890 --> 00:51:41,830
Are you going to quit?

772
00:51:41,830 --> 00:51:44,060
I'm thinking about it.

773
00:51:45,260 --> 00:51:48,210
Then, bye now.

774
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:50,660
Come again next time.

775
00:51:50,660 --> 00:51:53,180
You can come every day too.

776
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:02,940
Gu Jun Yeong!

777
00:52:02,940 --> 00:52:04,490
Yes?

778
00:52:10,130 --> 00:52:14,200
I don't think that you are trying to run away.

779
00:52:15,030 --> 00:52:18,270
I also didn't run away from judo, either.

780
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:21,000
But...

781
00:52:22,250 --> 00:52:25,910
I hope you don't quit the company, Jun Yeong.

782
00:52:26,660 --> 00:52:28,230
Why not?

783
00:52:29,210 --> 00:52:35,310
Jun Yeong, you are my only newly-hired colleague.

784
00:52:37,310 --> 00:52:42,240
We might be colleagues only for a year, but still,

785
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:44,530
you are my one and only newly-hired colleague.

786
00:52:44,530 --> 00:52:47,430
I hope you don't quit!

787
00:52:47,430 --> 00:52:49,140
I don't know how long it will last, but

788
00:52:49,140 --> 00:52:53,590
I want to work together at the company.

789
00:52:55,820 --> 00:52:58,350
I'm sorry that it's such a selfish reason.

790
00:52:58,350 --> 00:53:03,220
But I mean it.

791
00:53:03,220 --> 00:53:06,960
Out of all the reasons that I've heard so far,

792
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:09,320
it's the most reasonable explanation.

793
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:14,510
See you tomorrow at work.

794
00:53:14,510 --> 00:53:16,160
See you tomorrow at work!

795
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:17,720
For sure!

796
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:18,820
Bye!

797
00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:21,290
♫  In the dark night when everyone is asleep ♫

798
00:53:21,290 --> 00:53:23,900
♫  I'm the only one who forgot to sleep  ♫

799
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:28,400
♫  My heart which shines like that far away starlight  ♫

800
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:36,200
♫  Like the star passing through distant time which reached me  ♫

801
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:39,990
♫  Will I also be able to shine?  ♫

802
00:53:39,990 --> 00:53:42,670
♫  How's your night?  ♫

803
00:53:42,670 --> 00:53:45,300
♫  How is your heart?  ♫

804
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:50,670
♫   Even though the day was intense, the night shines.  ♫

805
00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:55,800
♫  For me every day the star greets me "Good day"  ♫

806
00:53:55,880 --> 00:54:00,040
♫  It shines on my fading wish  ♫

807
00:54:00,040 --> 00:54:05,580
♫  The whisper of a quiet night and the starlight cast on my room  ♫

 Berserk by Kentarou Miura

Did you read all of this?

825
00:55:56,100 --> 00:55:57,720
Yes.

826
00:55:57,720 --> 00:55:59,930
Then you must've read it from the comic.

827
00:55:59,930 --> 00:56:02,190
The quote I said before.

828
00:56:03,180 --> 00:56:04,740
Yes.

829
00:56:14,220 --> 00:56:16,560
 The door is closing. 

830
00:56:19,670 --> 00:56:21,980
- Team Leader? 
- Huh?

831
00:56:21,980 --> 00:56:26,030
I never intended to leave the battlefield...

832
00:56:26,790 --> 00:56:29,600
and never dreamed about paradise, either.

833
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:33,860
Instead, I was searching for a better battlefield.

834
00:56:33,860 --> 00:56:37,550
I didn't think this team was fit for me to fight fiercely.

835
00:56:38,580 --> 00:56:40,460
I was arrogant.

836
00:56:42,450 --> 00:56:46,390
I thought over the things you said.

837
00:56:46,390 --> 00:56:50,280
You said if I try my best at work, my surroundings will change, right?

838
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:51,870
Yes, I did.

839
00:56:51,870 --> 00:56:54,900
I will give it a try and change my surroundings

840
00:56:54,900 --> 00:56:58,170
so that this team can be the right battlefield.

841
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:02,200
All right.

 Three weeks of flashbacks. 

847
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:25,210
 Isn't this a prequel at this rate? 

848
00:57:25,210 --> 00:57:27,200
 Everyone is trapped in time. 

849
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:29,460
 The story isn't moving forward. 

850
00:57:29,460 --> 00:57:33,990
 At this pace, we'll go back to the birth of "Gumiho." 

851
00:57:33,990 --> 00:57:37,360
 Plus, the flashback scenes are so depressing. 

852
00:57:37,360 --> 00:57:40,840
This is too much. What is "Princess Ttomiho"?

853
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:43,340
 - Shouldn't he show us something new? 
 - Why are the view counts so high?

854
00:57:43,340 --> 00:57:45,760
Wow, such harsh wording.

855
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:47,950
 I think the boss of that place would be nice too. 

856
00:57:47,950 --> 00:57:50,940
 We think that would be a good idea too. 

857
00:57:50,940 --> 00:57:55,650
 Please, please. I hope Artist Na Gang Nam's brain that has become hard 

858
00:57:55,650 --> 00:57:58,800
 becomes soft once again... 

859
00:58:03,150 --> 00:58:05,200
 I'm ready for this! 

860
00:58:10,110 --> 00:58:12,430
It's flashbacks again.

 PD On Ma Eum 

862
00:58:27,740 --> 00:58:28,780
What is it?

863
00:58:28,780 --> 00:58:30,670
Hi, Artist Na.

864
00:58:30,670 --> 00:58:33,530
I sent you the manuscript days before it is due.

865
00:58:33,530 --> 00:58:35,420
Yes, I received it.

866
00:58:35,420 --> 00:58:37,190
Then what? Why?

867
00:58:37,190 --> 00:58:38,490
Is there a problem with the file?

868
00:58:38,490 --> 00:58:42,630
No, there's no problem with the file, but...

869
00:58:42,630 --> 00:58:44,790
Then, why did you call me?

870
00:58:44,790 --> 00:58:47,970
 I'm so tired from finishing the work through the night. 

871
00:58:50,530 --> 00:58:53,540
I'll be honest with you.

872
00:58:54,940 --> 00:58:58,560
The progression of the story has been lagging for several episodes.

873
00:58:59,830 --> 00:59:00,530
What?

874
00:59:00,530 --> 00:59:03,840
There are only monologue scenes or flashbacks.

875
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:05,750
Hey, you!

876
00:59:07,030 --> 00:59:08,970
What does a newbie like you know?

877
00:59:08,970 --> 00:59:10,950
While working on a long series, how...

878
00:59:10,950 --> 00:59:13,410
How could I develop the story and move fast all the time?

879
00:59:13,410 --> 00:59:15,970
Oh, right. Fast-paced story progression?

880
00:59:15,970 --> 00:59:18,090
You think that's everything? No way!

881
00:59:18,090 --> 00:59:20,130
You need to take a break in some episodes.

882
00:59:20,130 --> 00:59:22,540
The readers would have an easier time following then. With that!

883
00:59:22,540 --> 00:59:25,490
It's gone over 200 episodes with that!

884
00:59:25,490 --> 00:59:27,430
Right.

885
00:59:28,270 --> 00:59:30,310
Yes, you are right.

886
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:36,440
 Please, please. I hope Artist Na Gang Nam's brain that has become hard can become softer again. 

887
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:39,520
Why does she say such things in such a manner?

888
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:41,360
 I have attracted thousands of views... 

889
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:43,900
- What is it?
  - Should I explain it to you? 

890
00:59:43,900 --> 00:59:45,370
What are you watching that's making you sigh?

891
00:59:45,370 --> 00:59:46,800
 ...can become softer again. 

892
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:50,010
I mean, it's just a webtoon review influencer.

893
00:59:50,010 --> 00:59:53,770
She's mocking "Gumiho" saying that story is lagging.

894
00:59:53,770 --> 00:59:57,340
Unfortunately, it's happening since I started managing. So it's bugging me so much.

895
00:59:57,340 --> 00:59:59,610
- Gosh... 
- Who?

896
00:59:59,610 --> 01:00:02,770
Who's mocking the work that my daughter jumped through the hoops to make happen?

897
01:00:02,770 --> 01:00:04,970
What's her name?

898
01:00:06,980 --> 01:00:09,990
But isn't it true that the story is lagging these days?

899
01:00:14,210 --> 01:00:18,420
Artist Na said a break like this is needed for a long series and that

900
01:00:18,420 --> 01:00:21,060
if the story progressed continuously, the story would've ended already.

901
01:00:21,060 --> 01:00:22,640
That's what he's saying, but...

902
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:25,960
But three weeks of flashbacks is too much.

903
01:00:25,960 --> 01:00:29,110
If next week is going to be flashbacks again, I won't read "Gumiho Princess" for a while.

904
01:00:29,110 --> 01:00:31,010
Other readers will feel the same.

905
01:00:31,010 --> 01:00:33,020
There's no progress.

906
01:00:42,990 --> 01:00:47,670

 Webtoon Analysis 

908
01:00:59,460 --> 01:01:01,450
PD On Ma Eum?

909
01:01:16,630 --> 01:01:20,180
You know why I called you, right?

910
01:01:21,470 --> 01:01:26,140
The view count is much lower, right?

911
01:01:26,140 --> 01:01:27,740
The comments aren't good, either.

912
01:01:27,740 --> 01:01:29,140
So you know...

913
01:01:29,140 --> 01:01:34,220
You know, but you are not doing anything about it?

914
01:01:34,220 --> 01:01:40,620
When our main webtoons like "Gumiho Princess" stumble, it affects all of the webtoon traffic.

915
01:01:40,620 --> 01:01:42,810
You know that, right?

916
01:01:42,810 --> 01:01:47,940
Starting next week, it looks like the story will progress better.

917
01:01:48,660 --> 01:01:50,230
Are you certain?

918
01:01:50,230 --> 01:01:52,040
Not really.

919
01:01:53,410 --> 01:01:58,040
- But I want to respect Artist Na's opinion. 
- What?

920
01:01:58,040 --> 01:02:01,770
Artist Na's an expert compared to me,

921
01:02:01,770 --> 01:02:04,160
and his series continued for over five years.

922
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:07,580
That kind of know-how is something that I can't learn in the short term.

923
01:02:07,580 --> 01:02:09,520
So what if he's a veteran?

924
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:11,560
Is he right no matter what?

925
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:25,990
With these kinds of depressing flashback scenes, the view counts will keep falling.

926
01:02:25,990 --> 01:02:30,990
It takes a long time to bring back readers who turn their backs...

927
01:02:30,990 --> 01:02:33,220
You don't know that, huh?

928
01:02:33,220 --> 01:02:34,310
But still...

929
01:02:34,310 --> 01:02:38,190
instead of pressuring Artist Na, letting him do his thing freely is—

930
01:02:38,190 --> 01:02:42,000
But you can't let him become lazy!

931
01:02:48,320 --> 01:02:49,630
I told you several times before.

932
01:02:49,630 --> 01:02:51,840
Don't take the artist's side unconditionally.

933
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:54,990
The artist only draws the scenes that they want.

934
01:02:54,990 --> 01:02:58,120
Not what the readers want to see!

935
01:03:00,330 --> 01:03:06,250
The suffering of an artist is proportional to the joy of readers.

936
01:03:08,450 --> 01:03:11,290
Who do you think pays our salary?

937
01:03:11,290 --> 01:03:12,670
Huh?

938
01:03:15,570 --> 01:03:17,280
Tell me.

939
01:03:19,120 --> 01:03:21,230
The company?

940
01:03:21,230 --> 01:03:23,210
It's readers.

941
01:03:23,210 --> 01:03:28,330
For the joy of viewers, maximizing the quality of the showpiece.

942
01:03:28,330 --> 01:03:31,560
That is the PD's role!

943
01:03:32,610 --> 01:03:34,200
Without making that kind of effort,

944
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:36,560
you receive paycheck every time. Right?

945
01:03:36,560 --> 01:03:37,350
Right?

946
01:03:37,350 --> 01:03:40,270
Do you just want to be called by the title, PD?

947
01:03:41,170 --> 01:03:42,780
Huh?

948
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:48,770
It's because you assigned a newbie to a big shot.

949
01:03:48,770 --> 01:03:51,070
I'm going to a meeting.

950
01:03:53,880 --> 01:03:55,470
On Ma Eum.

951
01:03:56,130 --> 01:03:57,860
Think carefully.

952
01:03:57,860 --> 01:04:02,720
Without readers, there's no reason for us to exist.

953
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:05,500
Even this department each and every one.

954
01:04:11,820 --> 01:04:13,790
Go back to your seat.

955
01:04:14,460 --> 01:04:16,170
I'm sorry about this at this early hour.

956
01:04:16,170 --> 01:04:18,230
I'm sorry.

957
01:04:27,810 --> 01:04:29,380
That restaurant wasn't good.

958
01:04:29,380 --> 01:04:31,800
- The street fish cake?
 - Yeah.

959
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:34,800
Ma Eum.

960
01:04:48,550 --> 01:04:50,800
Are you okay, PD On?

961
01:04:51,980 --> 01:04:53,040
I'm okay.

962
01:04:53,040 --> 01:04:56,430
Deputy Editor didn't say anything wrong.

963
01:04:56,430 --> 01:04:58,210
I have to do well.

964
01:04:58,210 --> 01:05:02,550
In fact, Artist Na wasn't a top artist in the beginning.

965
01:05:02,550 --> 01:05:04,870
It's actually the opposite.

966
01:05:04,870 --> 01:05:08,070
Especially in the beginning, there were several suspension crises.

967
01:05:08,070 --> 01:05:11,870
There were several times when his storyline was too bland which pushed him out of the top rankings.

968
01:05:11,870 --> 01:05:16,580
The editor put his head together with the artist and fought to save it.

969
01:05:16,580 --> 01:05:20,400
It was like a three-legged race with an artist that created this piece of work, but

970
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:23,260
when you received the baton, you tossed it back to the artist

971
01:05:23,260 --> 01:05:25,290
and it's like making the artist run alone.

972
01:05:25,290 --> 01:05:27,350
That's what's upsetting.

973
01:05:27,350 --> 01:05:30,760
Three-legged race?

974
01:05:33,980 --> 01:05:37,600
I'm going to Artist Na's studio.

975
01:05:41,720 --> 01:05:47,800
 Up until now, I thought the comic artist was an athlete competing  

976
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:53,050
 and as a PD, I thought I was a cheerleader in the spectator's seat. 

977
01:06:10,320 --> 01:06:12,290
Artist Na, you are doing great!

978
01:06:14,100 --> 01:06:15,010
Doing great!

979
01:06:15,010 --> 01:06:18,120
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

980
01:06:18,890 --> 01:06:21,960
Artist Na, fighting!

981
01:06:21,960 --> 01:06:24,200
The end is right in front of you.

982
01:06:28,270 --> 01:06:30,240
Left, right, left, right...

983
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:32,500
Left, right...

984
01:06:33,570 --> 01:06:38,120
 I thought it was the artist's lonely and long marathon. 

985
01:06:38,120 --> 01:06:40,080
Let's go! Let's go!

986
01:06:40,080 --> 01:06:41,790
Let's go!

987
01:06:49,220 --> 01:06:50,780
 Not once 

988
01:06:50,780 --> 01:06:56,400
 did I think that I had to run with the artist. 

989
01:07:15,150 --> 01:07:18,410
♫  Where is this place?  ♫

990
01:07:18,410 --> 01:07:21,810
♫  I'm lost in my wounded pride  ♫

991
01:07:21,810 --> 01:07:25,680
 In fact, this was something that PD and the artist had to run together. 

992
01:07:25,700 --> 01:07:28,050
 It was a three-legged race. 

993
01:07:28,050 --> 01:07:30,000
♫  I have a new dream  ♫

994
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,320
One, two, one, two... 
 ♫  I'm looking for the lost me  ♫

995
01:07:32,320 --> 01:07:35,700
One, two, one, two...
 ♫  Once again take a trip  ♫

996
01:07:35,700 --> 01:07:39,240
One, two, one, two... 
♫  In the moment the darkness clears  ♫

997
01:07:39,240 --> 01:07:45,460
♫  The sunlight fills up in the warm wind  ♫

998
01:07:45,460 --> 01:07:47,850
♫  For myself I will  ♫

999
01:07:47,850 --> 01:07:50,240
♫  open the wings which were folded  ♫

1000
01:07:50,240 --> 01:07:53,480
♫  Higher, get up higher  ♫

1001
01:07:53,480 --> 01:07:58,230
♫  Fly Soar Fly in the sky  ♫

1002
01:07:58,230 --> 01:08:03,190
♫  Stretch your hands and reach for the light  ♫

1003
01:08:03,190 --> 01:08:06,090
♫  Will you take me with you?  ♫

1004
01:08:06,090 --> 01:08:07,460
One, two...

1005
01:08:07,460 --> 01:08:09,070
One, two, one, two...

1006
01:08:09,070 --> 01:08:13,040
♫  Following the dispersing light  ♫

1007
01:08:13,100 --> 01:08:23,000
♫  I fly I fly  ♫

1008
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:27,200
♫  Fly as if dreaming  ♫

1009
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:33,170
♫  Open the closed eyes fly farther away  ♫

1010
01:08:41,060 --> 01:08:43,470
I'm not even finished yet...

1011
01:08:44,160 --> 01:08:45,640
Why is she bothering me...

1012
01:08:45,640 --> 01:08:48,030
What is it again? Seriously!

1013
01:08:50,350 --> 01:08:53,630
Could you please revise the manuscript?

1014
01:08:53,630 --> 01:08:55,210
Give me a break.

1015
01:08:55,210 --> 01:08:57,780
It can't be like this.

1016
01:08:57,780 --> 01:08:59,940
Are you kidding me? It will upload tomorrow.

1017
01:08:59,940 --> 01:09:02,220
Are you telling me to redraw everything?

1018
01:09:02,220 --> 01:09:03,910
Yes.

1019
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:11,400
You are a total freak!

1020
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:22,060
I beg you.

1021
01:09:22,060 --> 01:09:24,060
"Gumiho Princess" 213th episode.

1022
01:09:24,060 --> 01:09:26,500
Please redraw it.

1023
01:09:44,220 --> 01:09:46,060
 No... 

1024
01:09:46,820 --> 01:09:48,910
 This moment. 

1025
01:09:48,910 --> 01:09:53,430
 This is Judo. 

1026
01:09:54,550 --> 01:10:04,940


1027
01:10:06,580 --> 01:10:10,270
♫  There isn't anything which can force me  ♫

1028
01:10:10,270 --> 01:10:13,160
♫  Don't comfort me that way  ♫

1029
01:10:13,160 --> 01:10:17,110
♫  The crisis faces me now and I feel like everthing will crash  ♫

1030
01:10:17,110 --> 01:10:20,120
 Today's Webtoon 

1031
01:10:20,120 --> 01:10:24,310
 I believe the time I spent sweating doesn't betray me. 

1032
01:10:24,310 --> 01:10:26,650
 You're just a newbie. How dare you press forward like that? 

1033
01:10:26,650 --> 01:10:29,520
 - Webtoon camper. 
  - What if it fails again this time? 

1034
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:30,860
 I'll take responsibility. 

1035
01:10:30,860 --> 01:10:32,370
 Let's aim for the win, once and for all! 

1036
01:10:32,370 --> 01:10:34,710
 You are so good at drawing. 

1037
01:10:34,710 --> 01:10:36,320
 Ambience is also very nice. 

1038
01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:38,780
 There's no such a thing as a hidden gem. 

1039
01:10:38,780 --> 01:10:40,950
 I like you, Artist Pomme 

1040
01:10:40,950 --> 01:10:42,850
 We have to wait and see if they can finish it safe and sound. 

1041
01:10:42,850 --> 01:10:46,440
 Trouble always followed that team. 

1042
01:10:46,440 --> 01:10:48,680
 Hey, what are you doing? 

1043
01:10:48,680 --> 01:10:52,620
♫  Don't comfort me that way.  ♫

1044
01:10:52,620 --> 01:10:57,650
♫  The crisis faces me now and I feel like everthing will crash  ♫
