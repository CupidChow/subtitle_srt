1
00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:08,050


2
00:00:31,152 --> 00:00:34,003
 Today's Webtoon 

3
00:00:38,354 --> 00:00:40,484
 Q: What do you do to relax after you meet your deadline? 

4
00:00:47,544 --> 00:00:49,774
 Isn't this that guy? 

5
00:00:51,383 --> 00:00:54,914
   Isn't this that guy? 

6
00:00:54,914 --> 00:00:57,084
 Whoa... looks like it 

7
00:00:58,544 --> 00:01:01,754
 LOL, should I contact him? 

8
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:23,724
What was the M &amp; A article about all of a sudden?

9
00:01:23,724 --> 00:01:25,924
Surprise.

10
00:01:25,924 --> 00:01:30,444
I was a little anxious relying on your loyalty.

11
00:01:30,444 --> 00:01:36,294
You could say that it's a minimum safety measure to prevent the tables from turning.

12
00:01:36,294 --> 00:01:38,004
Open it.

13
00:01:47,139 --> 00:01:49,194
How is the mood inside the office?

14
00:01:49,194 --> 00:01:53,884
 This is even more reason to secure the physical evidence showing his motive. 

15
00:01:53,884 --> 00:01:56,804
Everyone is taken aback

16
00:01:56,804 --> 00:01:58,017
so things are pretty hectic.

17
00:01:58,017 --> 00:02:01,337
It was worth giving them a surprise gift then.

18
00:02:43,529 --> 00:02:46,914
If we waver now, that's exactly what Heo Kwan Yeong wants.

19
00:02:46,914 --> 00:02:50,374
We're not stupid enought to fall for the same method twice, are we?

20
00:02:50,374 --> 00:02:53,244
The most important thing is to prevent artists from leaving.

21
00:02:53,244 --> 00:02:55,824
I think we should all move along with that as our priority.

22
00:02:55,824 --> 00:02:58,614
Right. Aside from the artists who are currently working on series,

23
00:02:58,614 --> 00:03:02,184
contact all the artists who are on breaks or whose contracts were in discussion.

24
00:03:02,184 --> 00:03:06,254
No, make a list of all those artists and send it to me as well.

25
00:03:06,254 --> 00:03:07,464
Okay.

26
00:03:07,464 --> 00:03:11,074
The problem is that internal opinions will cause a stir, not just opinions outside the company.

27
00:03:11,074 --> 00:03:14,134
Perhaps that is the true intention of Director Heo.

28
00:03:14,134 --> 00:03:18,324
More than anything, we need to dominate the mood during the executive meeting.

29
00:03:18,324 --> 00:03:20,704
And in case our negotiation with Artist Mo falls through,

30
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:23,634
we have to come up with a backup plan.

31
00:03:33,144 --> 00:03:36,664
What should we tell Artist Oh?

32
00:03:36,664 --> 00:03:39,304
Gosh, what do I say? Seriously...

33
00:03:41,634 --> 00:03:44,564
 It was nice meeting you, Mr. Gu Jun Yeong. 

34
00:03:47,724 --> 00:03:50,094
Any good ideas from the two of you?

35
00:03:52,654 --> 00:03:55,034
What? Did you two fight?

36
00:03:56,484 --> 00:03:58,934
- No.
 - I mean, you're not saying a word.

37
00:03:58,934 --> 00:04:00,154
Make up.

38
00:04:00,154 --> 00:04:01,224
No.

39
00:04:01,224 --> 00:04:04,144
What's there to fight about?

40
00:04:07,864 --> 00:04:10,504
Oh, hello, Artist Oh.

41
00:04:10,504 --> 00:04:12,504
He's wearing such a pretty jacket today.

42
00:04:12,504 --> 00:04:13,924
Pink, pink.

43
00:04:13,924 --> 00:04:16,724
Like cotton candy. I like cotton candy.

44
00:04:17,656 --> 00:04:21,414
Hey, Ji Hyeong. Did you lookâ€”

45
00:04:22,841 --> 00:04:24,634
Ji Hyeong!

46
00:04:25,414 --> 00:04:27,424
Seok Ji Hyeong!

47
00:04:27,424 --> 00:04:29,884
Oh, yes.

48
00:04:29,884 --> 00:04:31,964
What's going on? Is something wrong?

49
00:04:31,964 --> 00:04:34,214
Oh, no...

50
00:04:34,214 --> 00:04:37,824
I was just wondering if PD Kwon was okay...

51
00:04:42,481 --> 00:04:45,016
 CEO Kim Yeong Sin of Young Toon 

52
00:04:45,016 --> 00:04:47,224
Come over here after you answer the call.

53
00:04:47,224 --> 00:04:48,824
Okay.

54
00:04:59,454 --> 00:05:01,714
Welcome!

55
00:05:13,084 --> 00:05:16,574
I came here because I wanted to talk to you, sir.

56
00:05:19,585 --> 00:05:21,214
How did you know to wait here?

57
00:05:21,214 --> 00:05:24,414
You always came here when you were feeling down

58
00:05:24,414 --> 00:05:26,674
to grab a drink alone.

59
00:05:27,484 --> 00:05:31,664
Between you and me, is there still something we need to discuss?

60
00:05:32,444 --> 00:05:35,704
I came because I wanted to hear something from you.

61
00:05:38,554 --> 00:05:39,994
 Let's get a divorce. 

62
00:05:39,994 --> 00:05:42,614
 You work day and night. 

63
00:05:42,614 --> 00:05:44,774
 You're never around on weekends. 

64
00:05:44,774 --> 00:05:47,224
 You live at artists' studios. 

65
00:05:47,224 --> 00:05:49,334
 All you see are webtoon artists, right? 

66
00:05:49,334 --> 00:05:50,994
 You don't care about your family at all, right? 

67
00:05:50,994 --> 00:05:52,574
 Do you even know what day today is? 

68
00:05:52,574 --> 00:05:54,214
 Tuesday. 

69
00:05:54,214 --> 00:05:56,804
 It's my birthday! 

70
00:05:56,804 --> 00:05:59,494
 I'll let you go now. 

71
00:05:59,494 --> 00:06:02,754
 The webtoon work and the job that you love so much, 

72
00:06:02,754 --> 00:06:05,354
 work to your heart's content! 

73
00:06:09,574 --> 00:06:13,994
 I'm different than a salaryman like you, who has 

74
00:06:13,994 --> 00:06:17,664
 nothing to risk working within a company. 

75
00:06:37,844 --> 00:06:40,304
Say what you have to and leave.

76
00:06:42,054 --> 00:06:43,884
I'll apologize first.

77
00:06:43,884 --> 00:06:46,664
Forget the obvious story.

78
00:06:47,384 --> 00:06:50,294
What is it you want to hear me say to you?

79
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:54,214
I also want to receive an apology from you.

80
00:06:54,214 --> 00:06:55,924
What?

81
00:06:57,294 --> 00:06:59,194
An apology?

82
00:07:03,274 --> 00:07:04,494
What?

83
00:07:04,494 --> 00:07:07,304
Wasn't I meeting with you alone?

84
00:07:08,374 --> 00:07:12,414
It's nice to have several people in a planning meeting.

85
00:07:12,414 --> 00:07:15,174
I mean, the planning meeting isn't the issue here.

86
00:07:15,174 --> 00:07:17,694
Are you sure I can release my new work at Neon?

87
00:07:17,694 --> 00:07:20,934
Will the platform vanish all of a sudden, as soon as I release my work

88
00:07:20,934 --> 00:07:22,384
or integrate into another company or something?

89
00:07:22,384 --> 00:07:23,744
Gosh, no, no!

90
00:07:23,744 --> 00:07:26,784
Gosh... Why say such a brutal thing?

91
00:07:26,784 --> 00:07:29,584
That article was brutal, you know.

92
00:07:30,844 --> 00:07:32,944
I don't know if you two know, but

93
00:07:32,944 --> 00:07:36,584
GingerToon vanished while I was prepping for my debut.

94
00:07:36,584 --> 00:07:41,354
Gosh, it felt like the sky was falling.

95
00:07:42,614 --> 00:07:46,160
But I managed to survive because of one responsible PD

96
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,940
who brought me over even though I was a nobody.

97
00:07:50,554 --> 00:07:53,244
You were a rookie PD, too.

98
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,314
So, you know,

99
00:07:56,314 --> 00:07:59,634
I'm not all that worried no matter what happens, but...

100
00:08:00,746 --> 00:08:03,044
I got scared!

101
00:08:03,044 --> 00:08:05,034
Why didn't you tell me, huh?

102
00:08:05,034 --> 00:08:07,814
Was I the only one being honest, PD Choi?

103
00:08:12,684 --> 00:08:14,904
Artist Oh...

104
00:08:14,904 --> 00:08:19,014
Artist Oh! I couldn't bring it up.

105
00:08:19,014 --> 00:08:21,424
Why did you worry me so much?

106
00:08:27,964 --> 00:08:31,274
I was always earnest with you, Artist Mo.

107
00:08:31,274 --> 00:08:35,404
Our relationship was entirely slanted in your favor.

108
00:08:35,404 --> 00:08:38,444
I'm sure I couldn't pursue it if I only thought of it as work.

109
00:08:38,444 --> 00:08:42,554
I liked the person Mo Yeong Su.

110
00:08:42,554 --> 00:08:45,974
I acknowledged Mo Yeong Su as a person.

111
00:08:46,954 --> 00:08:49,414
Back then, couldn't you have just...

112
00:08:50,654 --> 00:08:52,514
trusted me...

113
00:08:53,244 --> 00:08:56,074
trust me, just a little bit?

114
00:08:56,074 --> 00:08:58,074
I did trust you!

115
00:08:58,074 --> 00:09:03,644
I did that because I trusted you much more than you could ever imagine!

116
00:09:09,524 --> 00:09:14,124
Without an artist, a webtoon cannot exist.

117
00:09:14,124 --> 00:09:17,124
But an artist without an editor

118
00:09:17,124 --> 00:09:21,854
cannot show his work to the world.

119
00:09:21,854 --> 00:09:24,554
If you can't show your work to the world,

120
00:09:24,554 --> 00:09:28,574
an artist... cannot take care of anyone!

121
00:09:28,574 --> 00:09:31,174
Not even the artist himself!

122
00:09:31,974 --> 00:09:33,704
Back then...

123
00:09:33,704 --> 00:09:36,774
I had chosen you

124
00:09:36,774 --> 00:09:39,734
as a bridge to the world!

125
00:09:42,444 --> 00:09:45,244
That's right. The company...

126
00:09:46,184 --> 00:09:48,184
That could happen.

127
00:09:48,184 --> 00:09:50,084
I'm sure it was beyond your control.

128
00:09:50,084 --> 00:09:54,114
But... couldn't you...

129
00:09:54,114 --> 00:09:56,974
have said a word to me in advance?

130
00:09:57,994 --> 00:10:04,154
Why couldn't you have said one word to me, man?

131
00:10:52,054 --> 00:10:53,884
PD Kwon.

132
00:11:00,254 --> 00:11:01,994
I'm sorry.

133
00:11:03,194 --> 00:11:05,744
Even though I knew your earnest heart,

134
00:11:05,744 --> 00:11:10,994
I spoke rashly and hurt you intentionally.

135
00:11:10,994 --> 00:11:17,274
You were not a salaryman who worked without any risk.

136
00:11:17,274 --> 00:11:19,094
I know that.

137
00:11:21,547 --> 00:11:23,527
I understand.

138
00:11:35,227 --> 00:11:38,000
Isn't this a list of Du Hui's favs? 
  Du Hui's 

139
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,500
Oh, not this. Give me a moment.

140
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,074
I found it. Found it.

141
00:11:43,074 --> 00:11:45,144
 Artist Oh Yun's Ideas 

142
00:11:45,144 --> 00:11:50,364
These are all the things we talked about while eating and drinking with you.

143
00:11:50,364 --> 00:11:53,624
There were quite a few interesting stories we could bring to life.

144
00:11:53,624 --> 00:11:55,734
You organized all these?

145
00:11:55,734 --> 00:11:58,574
These are all the things we were just joking about.

146
00:11:58,574 --> 00:12:01,514
Of course. All of the ideas we discussed...

147
00:12:01,514 --> 00:12:04,444
I wrote each and every item on those days.

148
00:12:04,444 --> 00:12:06,624
PD Choi...

149
00:12:08,084 --> 00:12:09,464
Amazing, Seonbaenim.

150
00:12:09,464 --> 00:12:12,064
Oh, "seonbaenim" out of the blue?

151
00:12:13,444 --> 00:12:16,824
In any case, I thought the fantasy stories were fascinating.

152
00:12:16,824 --> 00:12:18,224
 Animal Military Academy 
 A story about high school students.

153
00:12:18,224 --> 00:12:19,474
What is it about?

154
00:12:19,474 --> 00:12:21,684
Oh, that one?

155
00:12:21,684 --> 00:12:25,704
High school students  are involved in a plane crash on a school trip.

156
00:12:25,704 --> 00:12:28,984
They wake up after transforming into animals in a jungle.

157
00:12:28,984 --> 00:12:30,834
I think I can develop the characters pretty well.

158
00:12:30,834 --> 00:12:33,284
Make them cute and ridiculous.

159
00:12:33,284 --> 00:12:35,724
But isn't that about it?

160
00:12:35,724 --> 00:12:38,064
What if we add a twist to it?

161
00:12:38,064 --> 00:12:39,184
A twist?

162
00:12:39,184 --> 00:12:42,934
Make the school bully into a bunny.

163
00:12:43,914 --> 00:12:47,174
Turn the weakest student, the one who got harassed,

164
00:12:47,174 --> 00:12:49,914
into a lion, the predator.

165
00:12:49,914 --> 00:12:54,434
You can make it interesting by throwing them off from their usual social status.

166
00:12:55,944 --> 00:12:58,634
Growl! Throw a wrench into the food chain.

167
00:12:58,634 --> 00:13:00,084
Sounds good!

168
00:13:00,084 --> 00:13:02,214
What do you think, sir?

169
00:13:02,214 --> 00:13:04,594
Totally...

170
00:13:04,594 --> 00:13:06,534
It's totally my style.

171
00:13:06,534 --> 00:13:08,234
Hop, hop!

172
00:13:08,234 --> 00:13:11,074
An unimaginable twist in the food chain.

173
00:13:11,074 --> 00:13:13,654
It's good. Sounds good!

174
00:13:13,654 --> 00:13:15,084
What do you think, PD Ma Eum?

175
00:13:15,084 --> 00:13:16,584
- Hop, hop!
 - Growl!

176
00:13:16,584 --> 00:13:19,344
- Oh... hop, hop!
 - Hop, hop!

177
00:13:19,344 --> 00:13:20,804
Wow, it's really good!

178
00:13:20,804 --> 00:13:23,204
I think it's great! Well, g-good!

179
00:13:23,204 --> 00:13:25,304
- Right?
 - Yes.

180
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:29,434
Turn the school bully into a bunny.

181
00:13:31,314 --> 00:13:33,624
Jun Yeong.

182
00:13:33,624 --> 00:13:35,334
Yeah?

183
00:13:35,334 --> 00:13:37,534
About what I saw earlier.

184
00:13:37,534 --> 00:13:40,904
What's going on between Director Heo and you?

185
00:13:41,974 --> 00:13:43,994
I asked him about the article

186
00:13:43,994 --> 00:13:46,674
and he said it was an error. That's it.

187
00:13:47,704 --> 00:13:49,574
Just to say, "That's all..."

188
00:13:49,574 --> 00:13:51,904
Isn't it too big of a deal for our team?

189
00:13:51,904 --> 00:13:55,214
But it's not like I can pick a fight with him. He's an executive.

190
00:13:55,214 --> 00:13:59,254
Even still, it's about our team.

191
00:14:01,574 --> 00:14:03,600
Do you still think

192
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,550
that the team is separate from you?

193
00:14:08,744 --> 00:14:10,614
Shouldn't I?

194
00:14:15,094 --> 00:14:17,164
When you said...

195
00:14:18,224 --> 00:14:21,604
there might not be a spot for me on our team,

196
00:14:21,604 --> 00:14:25,474
I thought you said that to me for my sake.

197
00:14:25,474 --> 00:14:29,114
But now I don't know what your true motives are.

198
00:14:29,114 --> 00:14:31,704
Have you even once

199
00:14:32,894 --> 00:14:35,794
genuinely cared for our team?

200
00:14:42,364 --> 00:14:43,874
Sorry, sorry. I kept you waiting.

201
00:14:43,874 --> 00:14:45,644
No, it's okay.

202
00:14:45,644 --> 00:14:47,414
Good work, everyone.

203
00:14:47,414 --> 00:14:50,384
It must've been crazy for you all, and you had a scheduled meeting on top of that.

204
00:14:50,384 --> 00:14:53,344
- Gosh, don't mention it.
 - Thank you.

205
00:14:53,344 --> 00:14:55,864
PD Choi, around 8 p.m. tonight,

206
00:14:55,864 --> 00:14:59,214
let's rehash what we just talked about in my studio.

207
00:14:59,214 --> 00:15:01,704
- Let's do a good job.
 - Yes, definitely.

208
00:15:11,364 --> 00:15:12,754
Oh, hello.

209
00:15:12,754 --> 00:15:14,174
Welcome.

210
00:15:14,174 --> 00:15:15,904
Have a seat.

211
00:15:15,904 --> 00:15:19,104
Why did you reach out to me all of a sudden?

212
00:15:21,104 --> 00:15:27,104
I thought you might've changed your mind right about now.

213
00:15:28,234 --> 00:15:32,144
Are you still not interested in joining our company?

214
00:15:35,194 --> 00:15:39,144
Perhaps you didn't want me from the start,

215
00:15:39,144 --> 00:15:43,244
but you want to shake up Neon Webtoon?

216
00:15:44,034 --> 00:15:49,484
Either way, wouldn't it be a great opportunity for you?

217
00:15:52,484 --> 00:15:55,064
I read the article this morning.

218
00:15:55,064 --> 00:15:57,594
Yes, I enjoyed it

219
00:15:57,594 --> 00:16:00,954
and I see you trying your best.

220
00:16:00,954 --> 00:16:06,364
I'll also do my best and put up a fierce fight against Young Toon.

221
00:16:07,364 --> 00:16:12,034
But CEO, if you're a CEO of a company of this caliber,

222
00:16:12,034 --> 00:16:17,084
I'd like you to play fair.

223
00:16:18,764 --> 00:16:20,984
We'll do that as well.

224
00:16:40,844 --> 00:16:42,384
PD Kwon.

225
00:16:42,384 --> 00:16:44,064
Hey.

226
00:16:48,384 --> 00:16:50,714
He declined.

227
00:16:51,944 --> 00:16:56,744
He says it's too risky when he considers his employees.

228
00:17:00,684 --> 00:17:02,474
Good work.

229
00:17:02,474 --> 00:17:05,214
I'm sure it wasn't easy for you.

230
00:17:05,214 --> 00:17:08,304
We finally got some closure too.

231
00:17:10,264 --> 00:17:15,264
In any case, we'll have to come up with a new strategy.

232
00:17:18,064 --> 00:17:20,224
I'm home.

233
00:17:20,224 --> 00:17:22,314
You're home.

234
00:17:22,314 --> 00:17:24,874
Where are Mom and Dad?

235
00:17:24,874 --> 00:17:26,314
On a date.

236
00:17:26,314 --> 00:17:29,564
They went to see a late-night movie. They're so passionate.

237
00:17:29,564 --> 00:17:32,024
We need to catch up, you know.

238
00:17:37,984 --> 00:17:40,824
What? Did something happen?

239
00:17:43,264 --> 00:17:47,244
Just because... I thought

240
00:17:47,244 --> 00:17:50,914
I knew someone pretty well.

241
00:17:50,914 --> 00:17:53,154
But I guess that's not the case.

242
00:17:53,154 --> 00:17:55,234
Who could that be?

243
00:17:56,214 --> 00:17:57,814
Someone.

244
00:17:57,814 --> 00:17:59,734
What the heck?

245
00:18:03,614 --> 00:18:05,504
Stop, you're grossing me out!

246
00:18:05,504 --> 00:18:07,724
My gosh! Gross, so annoying!

247
00:18:07,724 --> 00:18:09,764
Stop being so annoying!

248
00:18:09,764 --> 00:18:13,234
 Recordings 

249
00:18:15,144 --> 00:18:19,604
I met Director Heo, earlier.

250
00:18:19,604 --> 00:18:23,704
He didn't specifically say that he released that article.

251
00:18:23,704 --> 00:18:26,034
I thought I'd be able to catch him this time.

252
00:18:26,034 --> 00:18:30,684
Jun Yeong, I told you to stop this.

253
00:18:34,764 --> 00:18:37,694
 It was nice meeting you, Mr. Gu Jun Yeong. 

254
00:19:06,764 --> 00:19:09,694
 What did you want to talk about all of a sudden? 

255
00:19:11,814 --> 00:19:16,274
 I have been... transmitting our team data... 

256
00:19:17,094 --> 00:19:20,124
 to Director Heo Kwan Yeong. 

257
00:19:24,244 --> 00:19:25,704
 PD Gu. 
  

258
00:19:25,704 --> 00:19:28,494
 Did you email our team file to your personal email? 

259
00:19:36,114 --> 00:19:40,424
 Then violating the security policy last time wasn't just a mistake. 

260
00:19:44,284 --> 00:19:49,044
 So... why are you telling me about it now? 

261
00:19:49,044 --> 00:19:55,614
 Director Heo Kwan Yeong seems to have a very warm relationship with Young Toon. 

262
00:19:57,804 --> 00:20:01,644
 I did approach him to find out his intentions, but 

263
00:20:02,444 --> 00:20:05,234
 if I make any mistake, 

264
00:20:06,684 --> 00:20:09,794
 I think our team could be in bigger trouble. 

265
00:20:11,674 --> 00:20:16,004
 I'd like to maintain this relationship with him for now and find evidence. 

266
00:20:16,004 --> 00:20:19,244
 Recordings 

267
00:20:21,034 --> 00:20:23,804
 Why are you going to this extent? 

268
00:20:34,694 --> 00:20:39,634
 One of the current projects fell through and since they're trying to respond to various inquiries, 

269
00:20:39,634 --> 00:20:42,284
 the rest of the projects are on hold for now. 

270
00:20:42,284 --> 00:20:46,364
 It's only a matter of time before the department falls apart. 

271
00:20:46,364 --> 00:20:49,854
 Why are you taking it this far? 

272
00:20:50,854 --> 00:20:52,314
 Why? 

273
00:20:52,314 --> 00:20:54,744
 Are you afraid that I have another card up my sleeve? 

274
00:20:54,744 --> 00:20:56,244
 After taking down GingerToon, 

275
00:20:56,244 --> 00:21:00,714
 I'm wondering why you need to respond like this about the webtoon team. 

276
00:21:05,964 --> 00:21:08,934
 What an interesting thought you have. 

277
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:13,074
 I'm always concerned for the sake of our company. 

278
00:21:13,074 --> 00:21:18,604
My criterion is what would benefit the company.

279
00:21:28,934 --> 00:21:32,174
 Stop Recording 

280
00:21:41,484 --> 00:21:43,824
What is the problem here...

281
00:21:43,824 --> 00:21:45,664
What's wrong?

282
00:21:47,514 --> 00:21:52,884
Artist Na Gang Nam send me a new manuscript, but something seems off.

283
00:21:52,884 --> 00:21:55,154
What's the problem?

284
00:21:56,704 --> 00:22:00,114
The problem is that I can't tell what the problem is.

285
00:22:00,114 --> 00:22:02,834
It feels like it's missing something, but I don't know why.

286
00:22:02,834 --> 00:22:05,114
Okay, let me see.

287
00:22:08,374 --> 00:22:11,664
Oh, he's using less color.

288
00:22:12,844 --> 00:22:15,094
Oh! You're right!

289
00:22:15,094 --> 00:22:17,304
How did you catch that rightâ€”

290
00:22:23,024 --> 00:22:24,124
Sorry.

291
00:22:24,124 --> 00:22:26,824
We got t-too close, huh?

292
00:22:30,234 --> 00:22:31,504
Is something wrong?

293
00:22:31,504 --> 00:22:33,134
No, nothing.

294
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,400
- Let's meet. Let's go to the conference room. 
 - Okay.

295
00:22:36,444 --> 00:22:42,684
We're in a tough situation, but let's cheer up and start the meeting!

296
00:22:42,684 --> 00:22:45,564
As you all know since we failed to bring Artist Mo on board,

297
00:22:45,564 --> 00:22:47,274
things are looking pretty bad.

298
00:22:47,274 --> 00:22:50,294
Each and every one of you should hold on tight to your artists.

299
00:22:50,294 --> 00:22:53,394
PD Gi, how are things looking right now?

300
00:22:53,394 --> 00:22:55,114
The inquiries on subscription payments

301
00:22:55,114 --> 00:22:58,134
have died down since the article correction was posted.

302
00:22:58,134 --> 00:23:01,084
And concerned comments over ending the current series have decreased as well.

303
00:23:01,084 --> 00:23:04,034
Once all the webtoons are uploaded as usual this week,

304
00:23:04,034 --> 00:23:06,044
I think the media  interest will die down.

305
00:23:06,044 --> 00:23:08,694
I'm glad. PD Gi, thanks for giving this your full attention.

306
00:23:08,694 --> 00:23:10,714
I'm sorry. Artist Yeo Tae Gu is calling.

307
00:23:10,714 --> 00:23:13,354
Sure. You have to get that. Hey, hey...

308
00:23:13,354 --> 00:23:15,584
how can you not pick up Artist Tae Gu's call?

309
00:23:15,584 --> 00:23:16,914
- Yes?
 - You should answer.

310
00:23:16,914 --> 00:23:18,614
Calls from artists are crucial.

311
00:23:18,614 --> 00:23:22,024
Then PD Choi... Okay, PD Choi has to pick up a call, too.

312
00:23:22,024 --> 00:23:25,114
I'm sure it's an important call from an artist, right?

313
00:23:25,114 --> 00:23:28,654
Well... next. Artist Na Gang Nam. what's going on with Artist Na?

314
00:23:28,654 --> 00:23:31,984
He says he's swamped, so I couldn't meet with him again.

315
00:23:31,984 --> 00:23:34,354
But he's sending in the Gumiho manuscripts on time.

316
00:23:34,354 --> 00:23:37,824
Isn't he just saying that to sign with Young Toon?

317
00:23:37,824 --> 00:23:43,304
I heard you two earlier saying you don't know what the problem is, and that is the problem.

318
00:23:45,704 --> 00:23:52,234
That's right. Anyway, y-you have to p-pay a lot of attention and take good care of him.

319
00:23:52,234 --> 00:23:54,104
We'll be in big trouble otherwise, really.

320
00:23:54,104 --> 00:23:56,214
Young Toon is drooling over him as we speak.

321
00:23:56,214 --> 00:23:58,834
If we're not careful, they'll poach him.

322
00:23:58,834 --> 00:24:01,034
Okay. I'll focus on him and do my best to take care of him.

323
00:24:01,034 --> 00:24:04,184
Yes. PD On Ma Eum, you must know this since you were an athlete.

324
00:24:04,184 --> 00:24:08,054
In a competition, it's not over until it's over.

325
00:24:08,054 --> 00:24:08,984
You're right.

326
00:24:08,984 --> 00:24:12,524
How about the "Peeve Weapon" dramatization project? Is it moving right along?

327
00:24:12,524 --> 00:24:14,594
We have a meeting with the production company coming up.

328
00:24:14,594 --> 00:24:16,574
We'll meet Director Sin Ji Won then, too.

329
00:24:16,574 --> 00:24:18,774
I should go with you, but with everything going on right nowâ€”

330
00:24:18,774 --> 00:24:20,844
Oh, no. Everyone is so busy.

331
00:24:20,844 --> 00:24:22,704
Will you be okay with going by yourself?

332
00:24:22,704 --> 00:24:24,944
Since it's a big project, do you want to go with Jun Yeong?

333
00:24:24,944 --> 00:24:26,134
No!

334
00:24:26,134 --> 00:24:28,844
I'm fine. I can go alone.

335
00:24:37,194 --> 00:24:39,854
It's at least a $30 million budget drama?

336
00:24:39,854 --> 00:24:43,024
Yes. It's possible because it's Director Sin Ji Won.

337
00:24:43,024 --> 00:24:45,754
Director Sin is very particular about his manuscript selection, but

338
00:24:45,754 --> 00:24:48,374
"Peeve Weapon" made such a strong impression on him.

339
00:24:48,374 --> 00:24:50,294
He personally suggested it.

340
00:24:50,294 --> 00:24:53,384
His personality tends to be straightforward and blunt, but he's open-minded.

341
00:24:53,384 --> 00:24:56,314
Director Sin is waiting for you inside.

342
00:24:56,314 --> 00:24:58,634
Make yourself comfortable and relax, Artist Sin.

343
00:24:58,634 --> 00:25:00,174
Okay.

344
00:25:00,174 --> 00:25:03,634
Director, they're here.

345
00:25:08,664 --> 00:25:11,334
Hello, I'm Sin Ji Won.

346
00:25:12,864 --> 00:25:15,084
I'm Sin Dae Ryuk.

347
00:25:20,694 --> 00:25:23,054
I'm PD On Ma Eum from Neon Webtoon.

348
00:25:23,054 --> 00:25:24,454
It's my honor to meet you.

349
00:25:24,454 --> 00:25:26,954
It's nice to meet you...

350
00:25:26,954 --> 00:25:29,784
PD On Ma Eum.

351
00:25:29,784 --> 00:25:31,764
Please sit down.

352
00:25:39,284 --> 00:25:42,504
I heard that Artist Sin wanted to hold this meeting

353
00:25:42,504 --> 00:25:46,764
with PD On present.

354
00:25:46,764 --> 00:25:52,084
It seems like the two of you have a deeply trusting relationship.

355
00:25:52,084 --> 00:25:55,744
Yes. PD On Ma Eum is like goâ€”

356
00:25:55,744 --> 00:26:00,660
G-Good... to work together. Yeah, that's right.

357
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:05,584
- In any case, it's nice to see. 
 - Thank you.

358
00:26:05,584 --> 00:26:10,854
I believe "Peeve Weapon" is quite a masterpiece.

359
00:26:10,854 --> 00:26:13,254
I'm confident I can also make the best drama out of it.

360
00:26:13,254 --> 00:26:16,704
But one thing that concerns me is...

361
00:26:17,484 --> 00:26:19,154
what happens next.

362
00:26:19,154 --> 00:26:25,214
You already have the rest of the story planned out, correct?

363
00:26:28,304 --> 00:26:33,634
Yes. They're stories I've been thinking of for a long time.

364
00:26:33,634 --> 00:26:35,264
Is that so?

365
00:26:35,264 --> 00:26:39,914
Sick people who fear death.

366
00:26:39,914 --> 00:26:44,344
People who become exhausted from caring for the sick.

367
00:26:44,974 --> 00:26:51,244
I saw something like black energy  those people emitted.

368
00:26:54,194 --> 00:26:58,324
You have quite an imagination.

369
00:26:58,324 --> 00:27:02,484
It's not  my imagination.

370
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:09,034
My grandfather stayed in the hospital for a long time when I was little.

371
00:27:09,034 --> 00:27:11,934
So I had to take care of him ever since.

372
00:27:11,934 --> 00:27:14,264
After my grandfather passed away,

373
00:27:14,264 --> 00:27:18,034
I worked in the hospital transporting sick patients.

374
00:27:18,034 --> 00:27:20,914
Those are the stories that I thought of during those times.

375
00:27:24,694 --> 00:27:31,954
I think I know why PD On came here with you.

376
00:27:34,484 --> 00:27:39,354
The artist has to be unique in order to write a great story.

377
00:27:39,354 --> 00:27:41,504
In "Peeve Weapon,"

378
00:27:41,504 --> 00:27:47,384
I loved that I could strongly feel what you were lacking in life.

379
00:27:49,524 --> 00:27:53,114
What I was lacking?

380
00:27:57,344 --> 00:28:03,044
The story of a boy where that "Peeve" was your mom.

381
00:28:04,414 --> 00:28:06,854
You have experienced that, right?

382
00:28:10,184 --> 00:28:15,524
I'm sure people feel that instinctively,

383
00:28:15,524 --> 00:28:20,644
and they feel real fear as though they're going through it.

384
00:28:41,794 --> 00:28:47,874
It's probably because Artist Sin was so focused on drawing that aspect with so much devotion.

385
00:28:47,874 --> 00:28:49,904
Right, Artist Sin?

386
00:28:54,354 --> 00:28:57,074
What's wrong, Artist Sin?

387
00:28:59,624 --> 00:29:01,534
Artist Sin...

388
00:29:06,014 --> 00:29:07,724
I'm sorry.

389
00:29:07,724 --> 00:29:09,544
Artist Sinâ€”

390
00:29:10,514 --> 00:29:12,714
Excuse me for a moment.

391
00:29:15,614 --> 00:29:16,924
Excuse me.

392
00:29:16,924 --> 00:29:18,914
Artist Sin!

393
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:31,060
You psycho! Do you have a death wish?

394
00:29:44,964 --> 00:29:48,264
So did Artist Sin leave like that?

395
00:29:48,954 --> 00:29:53,254
I think we'll have to set another meeting. My apologies.

396
00:30:03,944 --> 00:30:08,844
How about after they avoid each other for a while, PD?

397
00:30:10,884 --> 00:30:12,754
PD Jun Yeong.

398
00:30:14,664 --> 00:30:15,974
I'm sorry.

399
00:30:15,974 --> 00:30:18,064
Can you repeat that?

400
00:30:18,064 --> 00:30:20,314
The love-line.

401
00:30:21,554 --> 00:30:26,894
How about if we put in an episode where they drift from each other? 
   Breakup. 

402
00:30:26,894 --> 00:30:28,464
I don't like that.

403
00:30:28,464 --> 00:30:30,624
- Pardon?
 - Excuse me?

404
00:30:32,024 --> 00:30:35,944
Breaking up is sad. To the readers, I mean.

405
00:30:39,234 --> 00:30:41,454
It's tough, huh?

406
00:30:41,454 --> 00:30:46,014
The atmosphere at Neon isn't too good these days.

407
00:30:46,014 --> 00:30:47,824
No.

408
00:30:47,824 --> 00:30:51,054
We'll be fine, so you won't have to worry.

409
00:30:54,691 --> 00:30:57,844
The ground becomes harder after the rain.

410
00:30:57,844 --> 00:31:00,577
In work and love, once you endure some tough times,

411
00:31:00,577 --> 00:31:03,227
there will be happier moments.

412
00:31:04,914 --> 00:31:09,184
So once they cry their eyes out, right about this time,

413
00:31:09,184 --> 00:31:12,744
don't you think the love between these characters will deepen?

414
00:31:15,941 --> 00:31:19,731
 Breakup 

415
00:31:27,090 --> 00:31:30,900
You psycho! Do you have a death wish?

416
00:31:32,258 --> 00:31:36,664
 Do you still think that the team is separate from you? 

417
00:31:36,664 --> 00:31:38,604
 Shouldn't I? 

418
00:31:39,965 --> 00:31:42,624
- Okay, get home safely.
 - Okay.

419
00:31:42,624 --> 00:31:44,057
- Thank you!.
 - Cheer up.

420
00:31:44,057 --> 00:31:46,667
- See you next time.
 - Sure.

421
00:32:12,832 --> 00:32:15,102
You'll make the ground sink from sighing.

422
00:32:16,302 --> 00:32:18,692
Deputy Editor.

423
00:32:20,034 --> 00:32:22,174
Something's not working out?

424
00:32:26,212 --> 00:32:28,594
Why? What is it?

425
00:32:28,594 --> 00:32:30,944
Everything.

426
00:32:34,434 --> 00:32:37,304
Everything's just a big mess.

427
00:32:43,395 --> 00:32:46,315
- Oh, it's okay.
 - Stay still.

428
00:32:49,435 --> 00:32:53,075
But weren't we running together?

429
00:32:53,075 --> 00:32:58,704
Why are you trying to run alone as if you're carrying the world's burdens?

430
00:33:03,304 --> 00:33:04,894
Huh?

431
00:33:06,919 --> 00:33:09,774
I'm not sure if Artist Sin Dae Ryuk and I

432
00:33:09,774 --> 00:33:14,024
can run together well anymore.

433
00:33:16,394 --> 00:33:19,414
When you met Artist Sin for the first time,

434
00:33:19,414 --> 00:33:23,544
you believed in him, knowing that he would not be easy to work with.

435
00:33:23,544 --> 00:33:26,374
So, why do you think that all of a sudden?

436
00:33:26,374 --> 00:33:28,624
I'm scared.

437
00:33:29,714 --> 00:33:32,784
Artist Sin Dae Ryuk, before he met me

438
00:33:32,784 --> 00:33:36,704
seemed just like an awkward person.

439
00:33:36,704 --> 00:33:38,434
But...

440
00:33:39,604 --> 00:33:41,644
But now?

441
00:33:44,794 --> 00:33:47,884
He seems more unstable than before.

442
00:33:48,914 --> 00:33:53,684
Makes me wonder if I can handle him.

443
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:56,504
Perhaps

444
00:33:56,504 --> 00:33:59,474
I was wrapped up in thoughts of helping him grow as a cartoonist,

445
00:33:59,474 --> 00:34:03,594
and I wonder if I pushed him into becoming more unstable.

446
00:34:03,594 --> 00:34:10,164
Do you think I'm a suitable person to be in charge of Artist Sin Dae Ryuk?

447
00:34:18,024 --> 00:34:20,684
 Miss Han Seul (Artist Na Gang Nam) 

448
00:34:20,684 --> 00:34:22,694
Hello?

449
00:34:25,774 --> 00:34:27,224
What?

450
00:34:30,094 --> 00:34:31,154
 Contract 

451
00:34:31,154 --> 00:34:33,924
The contract looks good to you, right?

452
00:34:33,924 --> 00:34:35,284
Yeah...

453
00:34:35,284 --> 00:34:37,034
Is there anything you're unhappy with?

454
00:34:37,034 --> 00:34:39,114
No, wait a minute.

455
00:34:43,271 --> 00:34:45,414
- You came.
 - He hasn't signed yet, right?

456
00:34:45,414 --> 00:34:46,484
Not yet!

457
00:34:46,484 --> 00:34:48,654
Artist Na!

458
00:34:48,654 --> 00:34:50,504
No, no, no!

459
00:34:50,504 --> 00:34:52,234
No!

460
00:34:55,254 --> 00:34:57,324
H-How did y-you two get here?

461
00:34:57,324 --> 00:34:59,334
- Artist Na!
 - I'm in the dark about this.

462
00:34:59,334 --> 00:35:00,514
I called them.

463
00:35:00,514 --> 00:35:04,154
You'll get busier if you sign up for a new project.

464
00:35:04,154 --> 00:35:07,454
Han Seul, i-it's not a sure thing yet.

465
00:35:08,594 --> 00:35:09,814
This is cheating.

466
00:35:09,814 --> 00:35:13,064
The rule of this game is to win no matter what it takes, no?

467
00:35:13,064 --> 00:35:15,814
Neon just got rejected when you approached Artist Mo.

468
00:35:15,814 --> 00:35:16,964
I'm sorry, but

469
00:35:16,964 --> 00:35:19,404
strictly speaking, I don't think we got rejected since it was a false report.

470
00:35:19,404 --> 00:35:20,664
Oh, is that so?

471
00:35:20,664 --> 00:35:22,784
Then you can get rejected now while we're at it.

472
00:35:22,784 --> 00:35:24,184
Artist Na, please sign it.

473
00:35:24,184 --> 00:35:27,844
What's with you guys? D-Did you g-guys plan to fight at my place today?

474
00:35:27,844 --> 00:35:31,774
You said you'd serialize "Cold-blooded" with us, Artist Na.

475
00:35:32,774 --> 00:35:36,444
Sir! You shouldn't make such a hasty decision.

476
00:35:36,444 --> 00:35:37,674
That's right, Artist Na.

477
00:35:37,674 --> 00:35:40,684
Weren't we good together?

478
00:35:44,014 --> 00:35:45,544
Wait! Wait a minute!

479
00:35:45,544 --> 00:35:46,794
Artist Na.

480
00:35:46,794 --> 00:35:49,954
How much longer will you be tied down by loyalty?

481
00:35:49,954 --> 00:35:52,944
You should fly high with us at Young Toon.

482
00:36:05,784 --> 00:36:06,924
Han Seul!

483
00:36:06,924 --> 00:36:08,654
- Sir!
 - Artist Na!

484
00:36:08,654 --> 00:36:11,074
Han Seul is pregnant!

485
00:36:14,114 --> 00:36:17,694
Han Seul is with child.

486
00:36:19,314 --> 00:36:21,614
I won't create more work to keep me busier.

487
00:36:21,614 --> 00:36:26,474
Whether it's Neon or Young Toon, I won't create more work right now!

488
00:36:31,174 --> 00:36:32,464
Are you sure? Really?

489
00:36:32,464 --> 00:36:35,804
Yeah. For real.

490
00:36:35,804 --> 00:36:37,974
I always fall for your lies, Honey.

491
00:36:37,974 --> 00:36:43,204
I know I'll fall for it again, but I have no choice!

492
00:36:43,204 --> 00:36:44,964
I said, no more.

493
00:36:44,964 --> 00:36:48,884
My baby is having a baby...

494
00:36:53,484 --> 00:36:54,604
Baby.

495
00:36:54,604 --> 00:36:56,174
Baby.

496
00:36:56,174 --> 00:36:58,024
Your baby...

497
00:36:58,024 --> 00:37:00,154
Don't...

498
00:37:00,154 --> 00:37:03,874
My baby, don't yell, okay?

499
00:37:03,874 --> 00:37:06,634
- Wow!
 - Whoa...

500
00:37:07,694 --> 00:37:09,444
Whoa.

501
00:37:10,284 --> 00:37:12,454
So, what happens now?

502
00:37:14,266 --> 00:37:17,610
He says the spinoff of "Cold-blooded" is on hold for now,

503
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:21,200
but Artist Na also seems extremely disappointed.

504
00:37:21,204 --> 00:37:24,140
I used to think Artist Na could clone himself

505
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:27,930
and be able to work on both projects.

506
00:37:27,934 --> 00:37:32,774
But now he has his "real clone" and won't be able to work on them. Who knew?

507
00:37:32,774 --> 00:37:35,964
Geez. Come on, seriously.

508
00:37:35,964 --> 00:37:40,114
At least you won't have to chase his girlfriend anymore.

509
00:37:40,114 --> 00:37:42,294
How is Artist Sin Dae Ryuk?

510
00:37:43,224 --> 00:37:46,634
Something happened in the middle of our meeting,

511
00:37:46,634 --> 00:37:49,844
so we'll have to figure things out again.

512
00:37:50,484 --> 00:37:54,454
Aigoo, nothing is going down easy.

513
00:37:55,734 --> 00:37:57,294
So did everything that's supposed to blow up, blow up?

514
00:37:57,294 --> 00:37:59,884
Who's got something left to explode?

515
00:38:23,830 --> 00:38:29,170
 Seong Jin General Hospital 

516
00:38:29,170 --> 00:38:33,380
 Free Medical Checkup 

517
00:38:55,904 --> 00:38:58,214
 Diagnosis: Degenerative Lumbar Kyphosis (rounding of the back) 

518
00:38:58,214 --> 00:39:03,684
 Shows great deformity in angles, may need corrective surgery, continue outpatient monitoring 

519
00:39:03,684 --> 00:39:05,844
It's okay.

520
00:39:08,046 --> 00:39:12,227
I think you should stop.

521
00:39:13,114 --> 00:39:15,834
Ma Eum must've caught on, right?

522
00:39:23,074 --> 00:39:28,014
There is also good timing for conveying the truth.

523
00:39:30,524 --> 00:39:33,244
I think now is that time.

524
00:39:33,244 --> 00:39:40,644
â™«  I'm walking the path where I can't see where it ends  â™«

525
00:39:40,644 --> 00:39:47,994
â™«  Dragging my exhausted body today again  â™«

526
00:39:47,994 --> 00:39:51,754
â™«  Don't cry, don't cry  â™«

527
00:39:51,754 --> 00:39:55,394
â™«  It's okay, it's going to be okay  â™«

528
00:39:55,394 --> 00:39:59,854
 Why are you taking it this far?  
â™«  I wish you'd hug me  â™«

529
00:39:59,854 --> 00:40:03,280
â™«  I wish you'd hug me  â™«

530
00:40:04,224 --> 00:40:09,194
â™«  That would be so nice  â™«

531
00:40:09,194 --> 00:40:17,510
â™«  Like my mom, say that you're on my side no matter what  â™«

532
00:40:19,454 --> 00:40:23,720
â™«  Don't try too hard  â™«

533
00:40:24,934 --> 00:40:27,494
â™«  Take a break when it's too hard on you  â™«

534
00:40:27,494 --> 00:40:31,134
 I want to be like you, Deputy Editor. 

535
00:40:32,197 --> 00:40:34,994
â™«  In my heart  â™«

536
00:40:34,994 --> 00:40:36,247
 Really? 

537
00:40:36,247 --> 00:40:39,717
 I'm managing Artist Na Gang Nam? 

538
00:40:39,717 --> 00:40:42,094
â™«  Too much...  â™«

539
00:40:42,094 --> 00:40:45,054
 - Skin?
- No. Pee-ve. (Pee-bu is skin in Korean.) 

540
00:40:45,054 --> 00:40:47,144
 - Peeve?
 - Yes. 

541
00:40:47,144 --> 00:40:49,864
â™«  Don't cry, don't cry  â™«

542
00:40:49,864 --> 00:40:52,824
 Okay! There! 

543
00:40:52,824 --> 00:40:56,884
 Wait, wait, wait! Okay, okay! 

544
00:40:56,884 --> 00:40:59,954
 Ta-da. He will come back. 

545
00:40:59,954 --> 00:41:02,610
â™«  I wish you'd hug me  â™«

546
00:41:03,434 --> 00:41:08,214
â™«  That would be so nice  â™«

547
00:41:08,214 --> 00:41:11,184
â™«  Like my mom  â™«

548
00:41:11,184 --> 00:41:14,594
 I'll do better! Could you not go anywhere? 

549
00:41:14,594 --> 00:41:16,894
 What do I do? 

550
00:41:16,894 --> 00:41:18,074
 I'm not going. 

551
00:41:18,074 --> 00:41:19,564
 Please don't go... 

552
00:41:19,564 --> 00:41:22,694
 That's what I said. I'm not going. 

553
00:41:24,094 --> 00:41:26,234
 Then Deputy Editor, 

554
00:41:26,234 --> 00:41:31,244
 what kind of newbie artist do you wish to make under your care? 

555
00:41:31,244 --> 00:41:34,324
 Even if the PD in charge changes or the platform changes, 

556
00:41:34,324 --> 00:41:39,884
 an artist who could stand on his own and work it through. 

557
00:41:39,884 --> 00:41:42,904
 When Chief Editor gave me that homework for the first time, 

558
00:41:42,904 --> 00:41:48,714
 I think I gave him maybe about two answers. 

559
00:41:51,484 --> 00:41:56,090
â™«  That would work  â™«

560
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:59,544
- Are you going somewhere?
 - Yeah.

561
00:41:59,544 --> 00:42:01,694
To an offsite meeting.

562
00:42:01,694 --> 00:42:04,170
See you later then.

563
00:42:06,744 --> 00:42:10,710
â™«  Let's lean on each other  â™«

564
00:42:12,064 --> 00:42:18,710
â™«  Wherever we are, let's stop for each other  â™«

565
00:42:19,472 --> 00:42:26,480
â™«  When going gets tough, let's say that it's tough  â™«

566
00:42:40,044 --> 00:42:42,394
I'm here, sir.

567
00:42:43,054 --> 00:42:45,254
Oh, you came?

568
00:42:54,344 --> 00:42:58,844
It looks like the company is going through some rough times.

569
00:42:59,664 --> 00:43:01,744
I'm sorry about that.

570
00:43:01,744 --> 00:43:05,444
I feel accountable as a contracted artist.

571
00:43:05,444 --> 00:43:08,134
Oh, no, sir.

572
00:43:08,134 --> 00:43:11,414
Ever since the beginning of "Dragon's Dream" until now,

573
00:43:11,414 --> 00:43:14,804
you've been the biggest strength to us.

574
00:43:15,614 --> 00:43:18,124
It's due to our deficiencies.

575
00:43:18,124 --> 00:43:24,534
But you've never wavered and have stood your ground in your place.

576
00:43:24,534 --> 00:43:27,754
We feel so secure.

577
00:43:48,684 --> 00:43:52,034
- I'm home.
 - Ma Eum!

578
00:43:55,054 --> 00:43:57,004
Jun Yeong

579
00:43:58,814 --> 00:44:01,234
What brings you here?

580
00:44:01,234 --> 00:44:03,344
I wanted to talk to you.

581
00:44:06,406 --> 00:44:08,366
Hey, Ma Eum!

582
00:44:12,374 --> 00:44:13,557
You!

583
00:44:13,557 --> 00:44:16,867
 Where is this place? 

584
00:44:16,867 --> 00:44:18,727
 How did you get in, huh? 

585
00:44:18,727 --> 00:44:23,187
 That's what I want to know the most. 

586
00:44:23,187 --> 00:44:24,400
It's you, right?

587
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:26,560
You punk!

588
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:27,717
- Hey!
 - Wh-Why?

589
00:44:27,717 --> 00:44:29,527
You punk! How dare you come here?

590
00:44:29,527 --> 00:44:32,427
W-Wait! What's the matter with you, Dad?

591
00:44:32,427 --> 00:44:37,047
Hey punk! When did you start hanging around my daughter?

592
00:44:37,047 --> 00:44:40,977
Oh! Since that time! That's why you hid in here!

593
00:44:40,977 --> 00:44:43,507
I-I'm not that kind of person!

594
00:44:43,507 --> 00:44:44,987
What do you mean, you punk!

595
00:44:44,987 --> 00:44:47,017
Dad!

596
00:44:47,017 --> 00:44:49,147
He's my coworker!

597
00:44:49,147 --> 00:44:50,757
What?

598
00:44:51,547 --> 00:44:53,367
Helloâ€”

599
00:44:54,387 --> 00:44:57,037
I heard you came.

600
00:44:57,037 --> 00:45:00,127
But why is everyone here like this?

601
00:45:00,877 --> 00:45:03,897
Please come in and have dinner with us.

602
00:45:03,897 --> 00:45:05,527
All of a sudden?

603
00:45:05,527 --> 00:45:07,597
Surprise!

604
00:45:11,207 --> 00:45:13,727
I just put your utensils next to the food we eat all the time.

605
00:45:13,727 --> 00:45:15,977
Please relax and eat.

606
00:45:15,977 --> 00:45:19,787
We should formally apologize to you.

607
00:45:21,792 --> 00:45:23,887
Well, I'm sorry about all that.

608
00:45:23,887 --> 00:45:25,227
No worries.

609
00:45:25,227 --> 00:45:27,527
It was more than understandable, Father.

610
00:45:27,527 --> 00:45:28,597
"Father"?

611
00:45:28,597 --> 00:45:31,497
Of course, you're a father. Are you a mother?

612
00:45:32,717 --> 00:45:35,567
So, what brings you over today?

613
00:45:35,567 --> 00:45:38,587
You two must be extremely close.

614
00:45:38,587 --> 00:45:40,397
Is that so?

615
00:45:45,087 --> 00:45:47,097
By chance, are you two dating?

616
00:45:47,987 --> 00:45:48,947
Are you okay?

617
00:45:48,947 --> 00:45:51,537
No, Dad! How could you say that?

618
00:45:51,537 --> 00:45:54,037
Why do you deny it so vehemently?

619
00:45:54,037 --> 00:45:56,107
You never know about human relationships.

620
00:45:56,107 --> 00:45:57,857
I know.

621
00:45:57,857 --> 00:46:00,427
So I was wondering, what do you think about my eonni?

622
00:46:00,427 --> 00:46:01,877
Gosh, stop talking nonsense, everyone!

623
00:46:01,877 --> 00:46:03,957
Eat! Eat your food!

624
00:46:05,257 --> 00:46:08,087
I like Ma Eum a lot.

625
00:46:12,097 --> 00:46:14,577
You just confessed, huh?

626
00:46:17,797 --> 00:46:19,957
She's a friend I depend on.

627
00:46:22,157 --> 00:46:23,297
A friend?

628
00:46:23,297 --> 00:46:25,607
Just... friend?

629
00:46:25,607 --> 00:46:27,267
Yeah, yeah. Just a friend.

630
00:46:27,267 --> 00:46:29,997
Hey, why did you say it like that and scare everyone?

631
00:46:29,997 --> 00:46:31,867
Eat! Eat your food!

632
00:46:31,867 --> 00:46:33,687
Geez...

633
00:46:37,707 --> 00:46:41,377
No, no, no! Why, why, why?

634
00:46:41,377 --> 00:46:42,607
Nu Ri, bring out the glasses.

635
00:46:42,607 --> 00:46:45,177
Gosh, why bother?

636
00:46:45,177 --> 00:46:47,167
Jun Yeong can't drink at all.

637
00:46:47,167 --> 00:46:49,517
Hey! He can't drink. He can't drink at all.

638
00:46:49,517 --> 00:46:50,867
Not even a glass!

639
00:46:50,867 --> 00:46:52,387
That's nice! So nice!

640
00:46:52,387 --> 00:46:53,587
He can't drink!

641
00:46:53,587 --> 00:46:54,727
You don't have to drink it.

642
00:46:54,727 --> 00:46:55,737
No, no.

643
00:46:55,737 --> 00:46:57,987
No, no, no! I don't need one!

644
00:46:57,987 --> 00:47:00,797
No, no, no!

645
00:47:00,797 --> 00:47:02,807
It's okay. We're not going to eat.

646
00:47:02,807 --> 00:47:03,887
We're fine. We're fine, okay?

647
00:47:03,887 --> 00:47:05,737
Yeah, yeah.

648
00:47:08,937 --> 00:47:10,797
Sit down.

649
00:47:16,217 --> 00:47:18,027
That was uncomfortable, huh? Out of the blue.

650
00:47:18,027 --> 00:47:20,917
No. I barged in.

651
00:47:20,917 --> 00:47:22,587
I'm grateful they welcomed me.

652
00:47:22,587 --> 00:47:24,547
We also cleared up the misunderstanding.

653
00:47:24,547 --> 00:47:28,787
So, what were you going to say earlier?

654
00:47:28,787 --> 00:47:34,317
There are some misunderstandings, and I need some of your understanding as well.

655
00:47:36,297 --> 00:47:39,337
The reason I've been close to Director Heo Kwan Yeong.

656
00:47:39,967 --> 00:47:42,137
It's because I needed some information.

657
00:47:42,137 --> 00:47:44,207
Some information our team needs.

658
00:47:44,207 --> 00:47:46,397
What?

659
00:47:46,397 --> 00:47:49,397
Then why didn't you say so sooner?

660
00:47:49,397 --> 00:47:51,917
If I had told you, you would've said not to do it.

661
00:47:51,917 --> 00:47:54,207
You're always protecting me.

662
00:47:54,207 --> 00:47:56,877
Hey, how can you joke like that?

663
00:47:56,877 --> 00:47:58,457
Why are you doing such a reckless thing?

664
00:47:58,457 --> 00:48:00,667
You're not like that.

665
00:48:00,667 --> 00:48:02,397
Because of you.

666
00:48:04,637 --> 00:48:10,557
I stayed on the team thanks to you and I wanted to protect our team because of you.

667
00:48:12,047 --> 00:48:14,797
This is what I wanted to tell you last time.

668
00:48:16,997 --> 00:48:19,320
The confession about what I've been doing

669
00:48:20,530 --> 00:48:23,550
and the reason behind those actions.

670
00:48:32,717 --> 00:48:34,367
What are you guys doing?

671
00:48:34,367 --> 00:48:35,407
Your dad pushed us...

672
00:48:35,407 --> 00:48:37,637
Gosh, why did you push us?

673
00:48:37,637 --> 00:48:39,527
I know! Dad, lose some weight!

674
00:48:39,527 --> 00:48:41,397
Get out!

675
00:48:43,187 --> 00:48:44,287
- Okay.
 - Wait...

676
00:48:44,287 --> 00:48:46,967
Have a good time, you two...

677
00:48:49,077 --> 00:48:51,367
My family is, you know...

678
00:49:14,790 --> 00:49:16,400
 Stop it... Enough! 

679
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:19,170
 - Don't do that. I don't want to. 

680
00:50:28,317 --> 00:50:31,107
I think it's worth looking into

681
00:50:31,107 --> 00:50:33,467
the relationship between Young Toon and Director Heo Kwan Yeong.

682
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:37,800
When Director Heo Kwan Yeong was at GingerToon

683
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:41,517
he pushed for the sale saying that developing our department was inefficient.

684
00:50:41,517 --> 00:50:44,117
- The most likely candidate then wasâ€”
 - Young Toon,

685
00:50:44,117 --> 00:50:46,327
although, it fell through when CEO Yun Tae Hui took over.

686
00:50:46,327 --> 00:50:50,557
So, he was trying to hand us over to Young Toon but Neon took over at a low price.

687
00:50:50,557 --> 00:50:53,677
Now, he's trying to take over Young Toon through Neon.

688
00:50:53,677 --> 00:50:56,137
But it's odd to call it a coincidence.

689
00:50:56,137 --> 00:51:00,967
I mean the fact that he's consistently acting to benefit a specific company.

690
00:51:00,967 --> 00:51:03,237
I know.

691
00:51:03,237 --> 00:51:07,097
From what I saw, they have a special relationship.

692
00:51:07,097 --> 00:51:09,907
I tried to get more solid evidence, but...

693
00:51:09,907 --> 00:51:11,637
Wait, what are you talking about since earlier?

694
00:51:11,637 --> 00:51:13,777
What do you mean looking for what?

695
00:51:17,757 --> 00:51:23,597
When Director Heo demanded our team files and approached him,

696
00:51:23,597 --> 00:51:25,587
PD Gu...

697
00:51:26,197 --> 00:51:29,127
has been trying to find relevant facts using those opportunities against Director Heo.

698
00:51:29,127 --> 00:51:30,907
What?

699
00:51:31,767 --> 00:51:34,057
What if you got into huge trouble?

700
00:51:34,057 --> 00:51:36,217
And you didn't stop him when you found out?

701
00:51:36,217 --> 00:51:38,277
Why are you creating such a dangerous situation?

702
00:51:38,277 --> 00:51:42,957
No. I was going at it alone and got Deputy Editor's help.

703
00:51:42,957 --> 00:51:44,557
No.

704
00:51:45,807 --> 00:51:48,797
I'm sorry I didn't tell you right away.

705
00:51:50,577 --> 00:51:52,647
If we make this public...

706
00:51:52,647 --> 00:51:56,637
If you do that, we can't protect you.

707
00:51:56,637 --> 00:51:58,567
It's fine with me.

708
00:51:58,567 --> 00:52:00,817
It's not fine!

709
00:52:00,817 --> 00:52:04,537
Even if we make this public, there's no guarantee it will deliver a blow.

710
00:52:04,537 --> 00:52:06,767
Trying to prove his efforts for M&amp;A is just a theoretical argument.

711
00:52:06,767 --> 00:52:10,917
It wouldn't be easy to prove if there is personal gain.

712
00:52:12,957 --> 00:52:17,897
Now that we know what his goals are, we have to stay vigilant and fight.

713
00:52:18,587 --> 00:52:20,917
So I was thinking,

714
00:52:20,917 --> 00:52:25,247
as an alternative solution for Artist Mo's contract.

715
00:52:25,247 --> 00:52:26,617
An alternative solution?

716
00:52:26,617 --> 00:52:30,537
Couldn't we make Artist Na into the second Mo Yeong Su?

717
00:52:33,287 --> 00:52:36,917
We set up a company that could produce several projects by Artist Na.

718
00:52:36,917 --> 00:52:38,537
Like creating clones.

719
00:52:38,537 --> 00:52:41,467
What PD On said left an impression on me.

720
00:52:41,467 --> 00:52:43,147
If it starts as Neon's affiliate company,

721
00:52:43,147 --> 00:52:47,157
I think it would be a great alternative that the executives cannot ignore.

722
00:52:47,157 --> 00:52:52,657
Turn Artist Na Gang Nam into Neon Webtoon's Mo Yeong Su?

723
00:52:52,657 --> 00:52:54,967
As an affiliate company.

724
00:52:59,937 --> 00:53:03,097
Under the circumstances, wouldn't this be the best option?

725
00:53:03,097 --> 00:53:07,797
You always had so many ideas for projects, but you struggled with how to execute them.

726
00:53:07,797 --> 00:53:11,967
There's only one of you with a limited number of hours in a day.

727
00:53:17,737 --> 00:53:21,307
Look at these! They must be socks!

728
00:53:21,307 --> 00:53:24,507
They're so cute! Don't you think so?

729
00:53:24,507 --> 00:53:26,787
That's true, but...

730
00:53:26,787 --> 00:53:31,527
The time you'll spend with your baby, and trying to give birth to your work

731
00:53:31,527 --> 00:53:34,067
are all important issues for you, Artist Na.

732
00:53:34,067 --> 00:53:37,587
You don't have to give up either of them.

733
00:53:39,287 --> 00:53:41,137
Artist Na,

734
00:53:42,057 --> 00:53:44,587
I mean, Hyeong Gang Nam.

735
00:53:45,185 --> 00:53:47,477
You can set up a webtoon company

736
00:53:47,477 --> 00:53:53,297
and collaborate with other artists to produce your stories.

737
00:53:53,297 --> 00:53:55,497
We'll help you.

738
00:53:56,927 --> 00:53:59,367
But suggesting it be set it up as Neon's affiliate means

739
00:53:59,367 --> 00:54:02,967
you want me to go all the way for the rest of our lives.

740
00:54:02,967 --> 00:54:07,397
For you as well, Hyeong, this isn't a bad offer, either.

741
00:54:23,237 --> 00:54:25,537
I'm nervous.

742
00:54:25,537 --> 00:54:28,127
We need Artist Na Gang Nam, but

743
00:54:28,127 --> 00:54:34,047
he doesn't necessarily have to work with Neon.

744
00:54:35,797 --> 00:54:39,177
So, we need to come up with more reasons for him to do so.

745
00:54:39,177 --> 00:54:43,007
But still, Artist Na showed some initiative.

746
00:54:43,007 --> 00:54:46,377
So, have you talked things over with Artist Sin Dae Ryuk?

747
00:54:46,377 --> 00:54:47,957
Not yet.

748
00:54:47,957 --> 00:54:49,597
I'm supposed to meet him today.

749
00:54:49,597 --> 00:54:53,837
I see. You're seeing him for the first time since that incident, right?

750
00:54:53,837 --> 00:54:55,217
Yes.

751
00:54:55,217 --> 00:54:56,927
Just talk it over.

752
00:54:56,927 --> 00:55:01,187
Artist Sin Dae Ryuk and you have been doing well thus far.

753
00:55:05,057 --> 00:55:06,807
Okay.

754
00:55:14,615 --> 00:55:18,555
Artist Sin, did you eat yet?

755
00:55:25,495 --> 00:55:30,435
Why aren't you asking me about that day?

756
00:55:44,145 --> 00:55:49,605
Some wounds are tough to bring up.

757
00:55:49,605 --> 00:55:54,055
But if you just leave it because it's painful,

758
00:55:54,055 --> 00:55:59,335
it won't heal but instead, become infected.

759
00:56:35,735 --> 00:56:38,975
I thought it would be hard to explain in words.

760
00:56:41,885 --> 00:56:43,315
 Clang! 

761
00:56:43,315 --> 00:56:45,745
 Hey, you bastard, why are you crying? 

762
00:56:47,825 --> 00:56:50,975
 Clang! 

763
00:56:54,765 --> 00:56:55,905
 No, honey! 

764
00:56:55,905 --> 00:56:57,965
 Don't! 

765
00:57:00,590 --> 00:57:03,020
 No, Honey! 

766
00:57:08,035 --> 00:57:13,815
My whole life has been a series of bad luck events.
   Swoosh! Thump! 

767
00:57:23,135 --> 00:57:28,975
 Squeak 

768
00:57:44,450 --> 00:57:47,370
 Tip-tap 

769
00:58:04,005 --> 00:58:09,480
 - Stay still! 
 - Don't do that! I don't want to! 

770
00:58:13,575 --> 00:58:16,975
 My mom, who treated me like that, left me, too. 

771
00:58:17,655 --> 00:58:22,375
 And my relatives took me, so I could look after my sick grandpa. 

772
00:58:22,375 --> 00:58:24,495
 Mom! 

773
00:58:24,495 --> 00:58:26,845
 Mom! 

774
00:58:26,845 --> 00:58:29,595
 Mom, please don't go! 

775
00:58:29,595 --> 00:58:31,805
 Mom! 

776
00:58:40,135 --> 00:58:42,955
 Swoosh 

777
00:58:48,935 --> 00:58:54,565
After my grandpa passed away, I was all alone.

778
00:59:00,165 --> 00:59:01,785
 Swoosh 

779
00:59:09,525 --> 00:59:16,435
 Please... help me... 

780
00:59:20,425 --> 00:59:23,765
I thought this after meeting you.

781
00:59:23,765 --> 00:59:26,750
All the wounds and misfortunes that I went through in my childhood

782
00:59:28,010 --> 00:59:30,760
brought me my good fortune right now.

783
00:59:32,425 --> 00:59:35,255
I may be a mess, but...

784
00:59:37,995 --> 00:59:40,250
so that I don't become a bigger mess,

785
00:59:41,420 --> 00:59:43,720
please help me.

786
00:59:45,465 --> 00:59:50,105
With you by my side, I think I could also

787
00:59:50,775 --> 00:59:53,955
escape from bad luck and misfortune.

788
01:00:00,065 --> 01:00:02,795
 Please... help me... 

789
01:00:15,675 --> 01:00:17,865
Artist Sin, I'm...

790
01:00:20,965 --> 01:00:23,145
not a god.

791
01:00:24,825 --> 01:00:29,605
I'm not qualified to save anyone, nor am I confident to do so.

792
01:00:29,605 --> 01:00:36,785
At times, I can't even sort out my own life.

793
01:00:43,195 --> 01:00:48,715
Despite that, I'd like to help you, Artist Sin.

794
01:00:52,955 --> 01:00:55,105
I'll help you.

795
01:00:56,115 --> 01:00:59,705
With all the strength that one person can muster.

796
01:01:02,245 --> 01:01:05,515
I did from the start, and I'll continue to do so.

797
01:01:07,815 --> 01:01:11,185
I appreciate your courage.

798
01:01:33,015 --> 01:01:37,335
Would I be able to do a good job?

799
01:01:37,335 --> 01:01:42,295
You don't really have to do a good job.

800
01:01:42,295 --> 01:01:43,825
Just...

801
01:01:43,825 --> 01:01:45,975
Just do it.

802
01:01:57,225 --> 01:01:59,505
Fighting.

803
01:01:59,505 --> 01:02:01,355
Fighting.

804
01:02:12,365 --> 01:02:14,335
Thank you.

805
01:02:25,845 --> 01:02:31,995
I apologize for leaving so suddenly...

806
01:02:32,865 --> 01:02:34,935
that day.

807
01:02:41,595 --> 01:02:42,875
No, it's all right.

808
01:02:42,875 --> 01:02:45,475
It was my fault for running my mouth that day.

809
01:02:45,475 --> 01:02:49,755
By chance, if either one of you were offended,

810
01:02:49,755 --> 01:02:55,185
please do not stay angry and let's work well together.

811
01:02:56,175 --> 01:02:57,685
Here.

812
01:03:06,415 --> 01:03:09,025
All right. Take a seat, Artist Sin.

813
01:03:09,025 --> 01:03:10,825
- I'm glad we got to work together again.
 - Excuse me.

814
01:03:10,825 --> 01:03:12,995
On the contract, I noticed that it said

815
01:03:12,995 --> 01:03:15,455
Neon will be responsible for all damages in case there is a problem.

816
01:03:15,455 --> 01:03:16,755
Is that all right?

817
01:03:16,755 --> 01:03:19,245
That's just a standard line item.

818
01:03:19,245 --> 01:03:20,785
You don't have to worry.

819
01:03:20,785 --> 01:03:24,075
The Neon legal team has already reviewed everything.

820
01:03:24,075 --> 01:03:26,655
- All right.
 - Actually...

821
01:03:26,655 --> 01:03:32,635
I had some questions about your philosophical universe.

822
01:03:32,635 --> 01:03:37,705
If we were to look at "Peeve Weapon" from a different perspective...

823
01:03:38,435 --> 01:03:41,745
- I'll see you again.
 - Thank you.

824
01:03:45,015 --> 01:03:49,455
PD On, what was the director talking about earlier?

825
01:03:49,455 --> 01:03:51,535
Oh, that...

826
01:03:52,555 --> 01:03:54,995
It's kind of like, "Let's work hard together!"

827
01:03:54,995 --> 01:03:56,785
I see.

828
01:03:57,625 --> 01:03:58,995
Philosophical...

829
01:03:58,995 --> 01:04:01,265
What philosophical...

830
01:04:06,465 --> 01:04:09,015
Director Heo Kwan Yeong!

831
01:04:09,885 --> 01:04:11,875
Geez, what the hell?

832
01:04:11,875 --> 01:04:13,785
Read it.

833
01:04:14,765 --> 01:04:17,585
 Don't mess with my kid. 

834
01:04:17,585 --> 01:04:20,225
What the hell are you doing right now?

835
01:04:20,225 --> 01:04:22,925
Don't mess with my kid, okay?

836
01:04:27,505 --> 01:04:30,285
That crazy bastard.

837
01:04:39,365 --> 01:04:40,495
Editor.

838
01:04:40,495 --> 01:04:42,355
Hey, PD On.

839
01:04:43,675 --> 01:04:44,565
Is it all set?

840
01:04:44,565 --> 01:04:46,145
Yes, that's right.

841
01:04:46,145 --> 01:04:48,365
 Webtoon Dramatization Contract 

842
01:04:51,330 --> 01:04:52,685
Good work.

843
01:04:52,685 --> 01:04:54,905
Don't mention it. I'll head out for today.

844
01:04:54,905 --> 01:04:57,175
- See you tomorrow.
 - All right.

845
01:05:00,735 --> 01:05:05,685
 "Peeve Weapon" drama contract 

846
01:05:19,685 --> 01:05:24,220
 4 Neon Webtoon Contents Service Team 

847
01:05:57,205 --> 01:05:59,905
Don't schedule everything around your schedule.

848
01:05:59,905 --> 01:06:02,105
But you don't schedule things on Sundays.

849
01:06:02,105 --> 01:06:03,365
You're not going to be here.

850
01:06:03,365 --> 01:06:05,225
I have to see Ji Ho.

851
01:06:06,615 --> 01:06:08,445
Who are you?

852
01:06:08,445 --> 01:06:10,175
Me?

853
01:06:10,175 --> 01:06:13,840
I'm Artist Sin Dae Ryuk's mom.

854
01:06:19,820 --> 01:06:24,000
You're Artist Sin Dae Ryuk's mother?

855
01:06:27,730 --> 01:06:31,130
â™«  There isn't anything which can force me  â™«

856
01:06:31,130 --> 01:06:34,130
â™«  Don't comfort me that way  â™«

857
01:06:34,130 --> 01:06:37,080
â™«  The crisis faces me now and I feel like everything will crash  â™«

858
01:06:37,080 --> 01:06:40,620
â™«  The crisis faces me now and I feel like everything will crash  â™«

859
01:06:40,620 --> 01:06:43,960
â™«  Whoa whoa, open your eyes  â™«

860
01:06:43,960 --> 01:06:47,040
â™«   Someday you will stand again  â™«

861
01:06:47,040 --> 01:06:50,450
â™«  Whoa, whoa, think  â™«

862
01:06:50,450 --> 01:06:54,060
â™«  I think you will smile brightly  â™«

863
01:06:54,060 --> 01:06:55,880
â™«  Can't you predict everything?   â™«

864
01:06:55,880 --> 01:06:57,440
â™«  Pain also is like waves  â™«

865
01:06:57,440 --> 01:06:59,110
â™«  Can't I be your strength?  â™«

866
01:06:59,110 --> 01:07:02,270
 Today's Webtoon 

867
01:07:02,270 --> 01:07:08,210
 Are you having a hard time focusing on your work because of what you told me? 

868
01:07:08,210 --> 01:07:12,850
 You don't know anything about my child! Dae Ryuk needs me right now! 

869
01:07:12,850 --> 01:07:16,680
 I'm really sorry. I just can't think of anything right now. 

870
01:07:16,680 --> 01:07:20,360
 There are all kinds of explosive stories on Artist Sin Dae Ryuk all over the place! 

871
01:07:20,360 --> 01:07:23,970
 Why don't you just get rid of the Webtoon Team while you have the chance? 

872
01:07:23,970 --> 01:07:28,070
 What happened to you? I heard you went to the police station over Artist Sin! 

873
01:07:28,070 --> 01:07:30,250
 Did you cover that up? 

874
01:07:30,250 --> 01:07:33,750
â™«  I think you will smile brightly  â™«

875
01:07:34,430 --> 01:07:41,330
