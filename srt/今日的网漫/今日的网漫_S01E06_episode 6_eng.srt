1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:11,040


2
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:35,090
 Today's Webtoon 

3
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:41,430
 Before there was judo between us, 

4
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:44,460
 that was the last time Dad saw my failures as 

5
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:47,450
 part of the growing process and laugh. 

6
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:55,020
 The moment when he thought my mere attempt at something was seen as lovely. 

7
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:58,980
 The memory of encouragement for whatever choice I had made. 

8
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:00,950
  I had fun too! 

9
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:03,330
 Does Dad know? 

10
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:05,150
 How much those memories 

11
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:08,890
helped me throughout my life to become an honest and confident person.

12
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:11,600
 Neon Webtoon Services 
 On Ma Eum 

13
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:16,030
 It's okay if you think I failed. 

14
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:18,510
 I'm fine, even if you think I gave up. 

15
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:20,450
But Dad!

16
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:23,200
This is still my life as is.

17
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:26,250
I have to go through it,

18
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:28,210
realize...

19
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:32,410
and handle my own life.

20
00:01:57,510 --> 00:02:01,190
 Judo Gym, Build Your Confidence 

21
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,320
You did well.

22
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:12,290
You are doing great.

23
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:17,340
You did great...

24
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:30,800
Episode 6: Something incomplete can be filled with infinite possibilities.

25
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:45,010
Let's move forward with this.

26
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:48,450
The original author likes it too.

27
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:51,190
Really?

28
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:52,720
I'm so glad.

29
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,270
The content is good for the first three episodes.

30
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:56,230
-  Let's move forward as is. 
 - Pardon?

31
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:59,760
You can send me manuscripts for three episodes in a week, right?

32
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:02,240
Yes.

33
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:07,200
So there are no revisions needed for those episodes?

34
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,730
That's what I said.

35
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:11,340
Why can't you believe me?

36
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:13,600
Thank you.

37
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,460
Call me when you finish the work.

38
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:17,040
I'll get going then.

39
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,100
Okay.

40
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:20,650
Don't get up. Don't get up.

41
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:24,190
That's right.

42
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:27,200
It's possible to pass on the first shot.

43
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:31,250
Let's see...

44
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:33,830
Did you see this one?

45
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:38,190
Hey, isn't that Artist Oh Yun?

46
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:41,620
Is it really Artist Oh Yun?

47
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:44,030
I'm such a huge fan.

48
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,420
By any chance...

49
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:51,180
How did you recognize me right away?

50
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:53,750
Oh, my gosh! I told you we were right!

51
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:55,670
You are very handsome, Artist.

52
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:57,370
Aigoo, thank you.

53
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:59,450
Thank you for your love. Keep it coming.

54
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:00,610
Thank you.

55
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:03,680
One, two, three.

56
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,080
- Okay, thank you. 
- Thank you!

57
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:11,730
Artist Oh.

58
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:13,570
What took you so long to get back to me?

59
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:15,610
I sent you the synopsis a long time ago.

60
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:18,530
- Is it that bad?
 - It's not bad.

61
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:21,270
I just think it's a little difficult.

62
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:23,580
The SF genre is typically not that easy to do.

63
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:26,330
The worldview on the "Origin of Mankind" is already pretty complex.

64
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:28,250
So what do you want me to do?

65
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:30,360
Should I just forget everything?

66
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:33,100
I already drew more than ten storyboards.

67
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:35,760
Oh, really?

68
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:39,740
I'll send you storyboards for the latter parts.

69
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:41,640
Review that and let's talk again.

70
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:44,990
I agree that the beginning is a little complicated because there is a lot of explanation.

71
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:48,260
If you review the latter parts, you will feel completely different about it.

72
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:51,040
- Will I?
 - Of course!

73
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,810
I'm confident this time around too.

74
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:54,890
 This time around, I'll take out any funny elements 

75
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:57,830
 and make it totally serious and thrilling. 

76
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:00,780
I'll shatter completely the prejudice that people have against me

77
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:03,270
who say I draw with my handsome face.

78
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:07,580
Don't say you don't believe me?

79
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:10,010
Gosh, don't say such disappointing words.

80
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:12,560
I believe you.  I believe you completely.

81
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,260
Then send me the rest of the storyboards.

82
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:16,220
I will read it again carefully.

83
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:17,840
Okay.

84
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,630
Are you having a hard time convincing him?

85
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:24,840
I think he's totally stuck on his concept.

86
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,740
But this really isn't it!

87
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:28,300
Is it that bad?

88
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:30,080
Want to take a look?

89
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:33,140
I don't think the chief editor will approve this for the series.

90
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:36,660
But he's too popular these days for the editor to not approve the work.

91
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:40,980
- With this. 
 - Right. Everyone goes crazy every time he goes on shows.

92
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:45,120
I feel like he'll say he'll go to another platform if we don't release his series.

93
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,120
How can I persuade him without offending him?

94
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,040
 Compared to other content, webtoons are much lower in rating 

95
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:00,680
 Average Amount of Time Spent on Neon Portal 

96
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,580
 Proposal: Sports 

97
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,620
 Expected outcome: The target audience for webtoons are teens and people in twenties. 

98
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:07,260
 If we put Webtoon under Sports, it will draw more diverse age groups. 

99
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:08,780
W-Wait!

100
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:11,140
Wait, wait!

101
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:13,840
Is Webtoon being removed from the homepage then?

102
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,940
Why do you think that it's being removed?

103
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:18,290
It's being removed. What is it then?

104
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:20,620
One-click makes a huge difference in accessibility.

105
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:23,400
People here know that better than anyone.

106
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:28,640
Then... if we place Webtoon on the homepage,

107
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,800
what should we remove instead?

108
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,640
Search?

109
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,440
News, Shopping?

110
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:40,500
Which one can Webtoon push out among these categories?

111
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:49,600
Those functional services are important too, but

112
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:54,310
content like webtoons is important to increase portal usage time.

113
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:56,670
Portal usage time.

114
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:02,430
Especially, webtoons have many more long-term customers in the teens and twenties

115
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:05,730
compared to any other services.

116
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:08,660
Please reconsider, CEO.

117
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:18,870
Did everything go well in the meeting?

118
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:20,810
I tried to appeal to them as much as I could.

119
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:25,680
But gosh... They never accept my pleas anyway.

120
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:30,510
As for our presence on the homepage, we have to keep it no matter what.

121
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:32,640
I know that too.

122
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,230
I know. I know it.

123
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:37,880
I know, I know, I know times 100.

124
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:40,710
Are you getting lots of pressure?

125
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:43,050
Should I stop nagging, at least me?

126
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:44,840
No.

127
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,160
Thank you.

128
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:51,240
At least, you have to keep your head on straight so our department can work.

129
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:55,860
I'll try to stay on the homepage somehow.

130
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:58,700
Really.

131
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:05,510
 They may possibly play with numbers for the KPI. 

132
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:10,490
 Download all 

133
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,270
 To prevent them from playing that game, 

134
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:16,070
 you can provide me with a separate report. 

135
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:22,160
- Is the script out?
 - Yes, it's out.

136
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,210
Ta-da.

137
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:31,680
 My PC / File Names: Monthly sales data / Webtoon Service Team meeting minutes 

138
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,060
 My PC / File Names: Monthly sales data / Webtoon Service Team meeting minutes / Artists' contracts 

139
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:35,670
 Send 

140
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,800
 Send 

141
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,480
Is there a problem?

142
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:18,100
No. There's no problem.

143
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:21,100
Okay.

144
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:34,950
   PD On, let's have dinner when you have time. 

145
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:38,080
 I'd like to take you out sometime. 

146
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:50,750
Is she really going to keep working there?

147
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:52,730
That one-year contract position.

148
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:55,710
If she's not hired full-time after her contract expires, what will she do after that?

149
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:57,190
I'm sure she'll figure it out.

150
00:09:57,190 --> 00:10:01,190
Whether to extend the contract or get a job somewhere else.

151
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:03,760
What if all of that doesn't work out?

152
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,830
- Did you even congratulate Ma Eum? 
 - What?

153
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:10,060
She's been in sports all her life

154
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:13,860
and got into a company that everyone wants to work for.

155
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:16,490
I'm sure she wanted to be congratulated.

156
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:22,940
She deserves it, yet she was sneaking around like a criminal.

157
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:26,140
That's right! If I got into Neon,

158
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:31,190
you would've posted banners and danced around saying, "Let's celebrate!"

159
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:34,490
- But I still— 
- Ma Eum is not a criminal.

160
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:38,190
She's an adult who is allowed to live as she wishes.

161
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:51,160
Are you okay, Artist Gu?

162
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:53,600
It may be because I haven't slept much.

163
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,460
I had a deadline today.

164
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:58,720
I sent manuscripts for three episodes to PD Kwon.

165
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,050
You are moving along so fast!

166
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:04,600
Of course. It's much different than when you worked with me.

167
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,270
No!

168
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:08,290
I lacked too much then.

169
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:09,920
No, no. No way.

170
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,090
Don't blame yourself too much.

171
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:17,130
I asked you... out to dinner for that reason.

172
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:21,550
In many ways, I thank you and feel bad toward you

173
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:24,710
but I didn't have a chance to express it.

174
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:28,790
My goodness! Please don't think like that.

175
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:32,220
By chance, can I order one more pizza?

176
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:34,500
- Yes.
 - Thank you.

177
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:37,250
Excuse me. Can I see the menu?

178
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:40,310
 PD Kwon Yeong Bae 

179
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,260
Please answer comfortably.

180
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,860
Thank you.

181
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:48,390
Yes, PD Kwon.

182
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:50,510
Is there a problem with the manuscript?

183
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:51,900
It's nothing much.

184
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:56,840
We just need to change the main character's hairstyle to a courtesan hairstyle.

185
00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:01,540
- Excuse me? 
 - The casting for the drama of the original web novel has been confirmed.

186
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:04,220
The actress Yu Jung whose trademark is a courtesan hairstyle

187
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:06,670
has been cast as the main character.

188
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:10,300
 The webtoon character should be as similar to the actress as possible 

189
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:12,740
for them to sync, so people talk about it.

190
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:15,950
That's also good for you too. Okay?

191
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:20,290
Then, are you saying I need to redraw everything from the beginning?

192
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:23,240
I'm not saying redraw everything.

193
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,200
Just change the main character's hairstyle.

194
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,120
That shouldn't take that long.

195
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:31,080
No. It's not that simple of an issue.

196
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,130
I already finished coloring. How can I…

197
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:35,340
Anyway, that's been decided.

198
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:37,470
Please hurry it up. The deadline is the same.

199
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:38,850
What?

200
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:41,430
There are only a few days left.

201
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:43,120
That's how professionals are.

202
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,750
Please keep your promise.

203
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:48,870
Wait, PD! PD Kwon?

204
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:58,940
What's wrong? Is something the matter?

205
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:01,350
- He says to do it all over.
 - What?

206
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:03,790
The manuscript that I submitted.

207
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:07,700
He wants me to redraw everything from the beginning.

208
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:10,620
What do you mean?

209
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:12,610
That's what I mean.

210
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:17,350
If this was the case, he shouldn't have approved it from the start.

211
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:20,490
Artist Gu, are you all right?

212
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:24,630
I'm really sorry, but can I go ahead?

213
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:27,000
I can't stand to sit here because I feel so rushed.

214
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,090
Of course, sure. Please go and work.

215
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:31,400
Thank you, PD On.

216
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:40,470
Right.

217
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:49,660
- Good morning. 
 -  Good morning. 

218
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:57,920
Geez, you scared me.

219
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,300
Why?

220
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:02,010
- Do you have something to say? 
- Yes.

221
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:04,740
Really?

222
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:10,930
Follow me.

223
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:20,610
What is it early in the morning?

224
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:23,570
I met Artist Gu Seul Ah yesterday.

225
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:25,270
Why are you meeting my artist?

226
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:29,110
We met just to have dinner together.

227
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:32,500
I heard her talking with you over the phone.

228
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,220
And?

229
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:39,630
Asking her to change the character concept so suddenly and rework the manuscript

230
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:42,110
seems a little too harsh.

231
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:44,940
Do you think I wanted to do that?

232
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:48,330
Following the actress's image helps the webtoon sales a lot.

233
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:50,080
Even if that's the case,

234
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:52,000
wasn't the concept already approved?

235
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,530
Asking her to redraw a character that was already approved is just—

236
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:56,720
That's how it always is in this industry.

237
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:01,370
Going back to the drawing board hundreds of times to make webtoons that sell more is very common.

238
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:03,930
- But still.
 - PD On Ma Eum.

239
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:06,330
Artist Gu Seul Ah is my artist. I'll manage her.

240
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:08,020
Are you telling me how to do my job?

241
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:10,650
Did Artist Gu ask you to talk to me, by chance?

242
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:15,100
- No, it's not that.
 - If that's not it, don't cross the line anymore.

243
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:17,110
You are not Artist Gu's spokeswoman.

244
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:20,690
If she has something to say, tell her to talk to me directly. Got it?

245
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:22,870
Ruining my morning here...

246
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:35,630
Isn't PD Kwon too much?

247
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:39,240
He's too much.

248
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:42,970
- He's like On Mandu from a few weeks ago. 
 - What?

249
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:46,540
You also asked me to redraw everything on the day it was due, On Mandu.

250
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:49,830
Telling me all kinds of reasons why.

251
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:54,490
You did have a hard time, Honey, huh?

252
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:57,360
No. That's because you're perfectly capable of doing that.

253
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,950
Oh, and Artist Gu Seul Ah can't?

254
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:02,160
Are you looking down on her because she's a newbie?

255
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,520
Gosh. No, that's not it.

256
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:07,110
I'm sure Artist Gu Seul Ah can do it too.

257
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:08,880
She will have to go through it numerous times going forward anyway.

258
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,750
Take a look at me!

259
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:15,280
Even though I'm a top artist, I still get revision requests from a newbie PD.

260
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:20,900
Are you still mad at me for that incident?

261
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:25,520
I usually grudges for a long time.

262
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,540
Come on now.

263
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:30,960
But you know.

264
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:34,120
Just like a PD bad-mouthing an artist in front of another artist,

265
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:37,710
bad-mouthing another PD is also taboo.

266
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:40,140
PDs are all the same to artists.

267
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:44,680
So do you think we'd be empathetic to that PD for bad-mouthing another PD?

268
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:47,340
They're all the same to the artists.

269
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,350
You're right.

270
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:52,420
I spat on my own face.

271
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:56,500
Anyway, I guess PD Kwon is still the same.

272
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:59,600
I guess his infamy lives on.

273
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,980
- Infamy?
 - You don't know?

274
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:06,000
He's known as the grave for newbie artists.

275
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,050
All the artists who work with him vanish after one project

276
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:12,240
or tons of them break down.

277
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:18,140
 You can go home now. 

278
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:24,910
Dong Hui!

279
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:26,780
Im Dong Hui!

280
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:28,050
Hey, Dong Hui!

281
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:29,320
Dong Hui!

282
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:32,320
- Dong Hui!
 - Sir, what happened?

283
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,440
It's gone again.

284
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:40,150
 Keyboard shortcuts 

285
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:44,850
Oh? Is it really gone?

286
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:52,830
Sir, there's a backup file, fortunately.

287
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:56,290
Really? I'm so glad.

288
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:01,440
Deputy Editor Seok Ji Hyeong, you were here too?

289
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:05,030
Yes, sir.

290
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:14,080
I just wanted to let you know that we're down to

291
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,560
about half of your backup manuscripts.

292
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,140
Aigoo, already?

293
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:20,490
Oh, boy...

294
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:24,310
It's scarier than my bank account balance running out.

295
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:27,160
You'll soon pick up your regular speed.

296
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:32,800
He sleeps less these days to learn how to use the tablet.

297
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:35,070
Aigoo, makes me wonder

298
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:37,300
if I'm being a daredevil at my age.

299
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:39,210
What do you mean by being a daredevil?

300
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:41,380
It's great courage.

301
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:44,010
Should I commute here every day?

302
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:46,750
- I can help—
 - Oh, no, no.

303
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:54,050
I nagged others my whole life telling them to meet their deadline.

304
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:56,700
It's not easy.

305
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:20,200
For Artist Lee Wu Jin's "Full Count,"

306
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,820
the monitoring responses are both good internally and externally.

307
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:25,080
I think making a series out of it will be possible if given a chance.

308
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,330
Okay.

309
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:28,180
I'll bring it up during the next new project meeting.

310
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:31,500
Well, how are things going with Artist Sin Dae Ryuk?

311
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,580
PD On?

312
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:39,740
The status update on Artist Sin Dae Ryuk.

313
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:42,270
Oh, yes.

314
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:44,080
He's continuing to work on his storyboards.

315
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:48,500
And his drawings are improving so he's working on pen-line drawings for the early episodes.

316
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:52,630
I'm trying to get a complete Episode 1 from him and receive monitoring.

317
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:54,850
Okay, I got it.

318
00:19:58,650 --> 00:20:00,540
Thank you.

319
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:06,850
Is there something going on?

320
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:11,780
Artist Gu Seul Ah. I'm worried about her.

321
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:14,490
I couldn't focus on the meeting.

322
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:20,570
I see your weakness now, On Ma Eum.

323
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:22,420
What?

324
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:24,440
It was the same with Artist Sin Dae Ryuk.

325
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:27,420
You seem to overly empathize with your artists.

326
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:30,640
It's good to be passionate in your work, but at this rate,

327
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,630
you can get hurt, On Ma Eum.

328
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,460
I admit it.

329
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:43,750
But he could've been a little more considerate and careful toward Artist Gu.

330
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:46,280
I'm upset that PD Kwon

331
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:50,070
treats newbie artists like they're expendable.

332
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:52,770
I don't really like PD Kwon as my superior, either,

333
00:20:52,770 --> 00:20:57,500
but there are artists who made their debut with PD Kwon, like Artist Pomme, and made it to the top.

334
00:21:55,210 --> 00:21:57,150
 As you can see, this tree is a pine tree. 

335
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:59,000
 Until thirty years ago, every spring when it was in full bloom, it made a flower path. 

336
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:03,400
 I'm sorry 

337
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:07,320
I think you have to download first, then

338
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:09,910
the distance between the characters...

339
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:12,740
Hey, no, no, no! Don't look!

340
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:16,430
Did you draw this, Hyeong?

341
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:17,850
Yeah.

342
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:19,920
I'm going to enter a competition.

343
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,750
I see.

344
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:23,720
How much of it did you see?

345
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:26,870
I saw almost everything.

346
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:32,590
Is it that bad?

347
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:35,630
Bad enough to have no reaction at all?

348
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:39,510
No. You didn't ask me what I thought.

349
00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:43,300
How was it?

350
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:46,410
I thought...

351
00:22:48,770 --> 00:22:51,020
it was fun.

352
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:53,160
I liked it because it's different than other comics.

353
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:55,800
R-Really?

354
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,680
Thanks.

355
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:04,400
But it's making me nervous since Sin Dae Ryuk says it's fun.

356
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:08,280
What if I get rejected again?

357
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,480
Why do you say stuff like that all the time?

358
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,530
- What?
 - You deprecate yourself.

359
00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:15,640
Pessimistic words.

360
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:22,180
Now you're trying to teach me.

361
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:24,190
Fine. You're all that.

362
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:28,630
If you debut first, hire me as your assistant, okay?

363
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:32,240
I will.

364
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,290
- I will hire you.
 - Hey.

365
00:23:34,290 --> 00:23:36,870
Hyeong was just joking.

366
00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:43,610
Even if it's a joke, don't say things you don't mean.

367
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:46,670
Words have strong power.

368
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:52,140
When my grandfather was sick, I was caring for him.

369
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:56,320
One day, he said, "Now I'm done.

370
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,100
It's all over."

371
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:01,470
For the first time, something I've never seen before

372
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:05,030
sprouted out of my grandpa.

373
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:10,970
Maybe it was the spirit that was within those words.

374
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:18,030
The day after he spewed that out, Grandpa was stone cold.

375
00:24:23,810 --> 00:24:27,060
If you spit out bad thoughts, that will happen.

376
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:32,880
As if you were cursed by your own words.

377
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,650
 Artist Gu Seul Ha  
 Artist Gu Seul Ah?

378
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:47,990
Yes, Artist Gu. What's going on?

379
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:49,370
I'm sorry.

380
00:24:49,370 --> 00:24:52,420
PD Kwon is not picking up the phone.

381
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:55,180
It's okay. What is it?

382
00:24:55,180 --> 00:25:01,230
While changing the character's hairstyle, the order of the scenes have changed.

383
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:04,290
I wanted to know if that's okay.

384
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:09,510
If there are no major changes to the storyline, it should be fine, but

385
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:13,200
let me ask other PDs just to make sure.

386
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:16,240
I'm so relieved.

387
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:21,650
 But since you gave me a greenlight, 

388
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:25,420
I think I can continue working without worrying.

389
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,340
Artist Gu, you're okay, right?

390
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:32,740
The schedule must be too tight for you.

391
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:34,730
I have no choice.

392
00:25:34,730 --> 00:25:37,460
A promise is a promise.

393
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:41,900
Yes, thank you.

394
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:01,060
It's okay. I can do this.

395
00:27:18,050 --> 00:27:20,210
PD Gu.

396
00:27:20,210 --> 00:27:23,300
Did you email our team file to your personal email?

397
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:25,500
What?

398
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:39,060
The security team contacted me.

399
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:41,900
If a team leader or a security manager isn't copied on the email

400
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:44,490
and an internal document is attached to it,

401
00:27:44,490 --> 00:27:47,180
it sends a notification to the security team.

402
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:51,860
They sent me the information on what they were monitoring.

403
00:27:55,570 --> 00:27:59,680
I wanted to review some files at home after work.

404
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:02,850
I didn't realize I was violating security measures.

405
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:05,120
I'll be careful in the future.

406
00:28:10,610 --> 00:28:11,810
Don't work too hard.

407
00:28:11,810 --> 00:28:15,000
You should rest when you're supposed to. Isn't that right?

408
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,640
Yes.

409
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:22,100
With that in mind... there!

410
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:25,850
What is this?

411
00:28:25,850 --> 00:28:27,610
Artist Pomme's books.

412
00:28:27,610 --> 00:28:29,110
This will be used during fan autograph events.

413
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:31,520
Take them all and get her to autograph all of them.

414
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,100
- All of them?
 - Yeah.

415
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:35,360
How many are there?

416
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,180
One hundred.

417
00:28:44,290 --> 00:28:46,320
I'll go with him.

418
00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:51,180
With him?

419
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:54,960
Yes, I can carry everything.

420
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,990
Y-Yeah?

421
00:28:56,990 --> 00:28:58,600
Yeah. Sure.

422
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:01,710
Then, send autographed copies

423
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:04,100
to the publishing office via delivery service

424
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:06,060
and then...

425
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:09,430
- call it a day.
 - A day!

426
00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:11,970
Thank you! Yay!

427
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:28,280
Let's go.

428
00:29:30,370 --> 00:29:32,640
Let's go. I'm okay.

429
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:36,610
Give it to me.

430
00:29:36,610 --> 00:29:38,630
I'm okay.

431
00:29:38,630 --> 00:29:42,610
Even so, if you carry all that by yourself, what does that make me?

432
00:29:42,610 --> 00:29:45,100
What do you mean? We're walking together.

433
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:47,660
Geez, I will carry it.

434
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:50,600
I'm a man, you know.

435
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,140
♫  Surrounded by empty bottles  ♫

436
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:53,400
Fine then.

437
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:56,660
♫  Singing songs of our own  ♫

438
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:00,460
- I thought—
 - Not too bad, right?

439
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:02,230
What?

440
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:03,610
Yes. Yes.

441
00:30:03,610 --> 00:30:04,730
Okay, then.

442
00:30:04,730 --> 00:30:08,180
♫  We know, I know, I know, I know  ♫

443
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:09,540
Tell me if it's too heavy.

444
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:11,060
Okay!

445
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:14,890
♫  I need you to warm this lonely heart tonight  ♫

446
00:30:14,890 --> 00:30:18,100
Wow, this is Artist Pomme's place?

447
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:21,440
Wow, top artists are definitely different.

448
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,590
♫  Telling you to say to her  ♫

449
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:27,210
Okay. Seriously, I'll carry it. Give it to me.

450
00:30:27,210 --> 00:30:29,690
- No, no, no. 
 - Seriously.

451
00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:32,600
♫  I will always be with you, My love  ♫

452
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,090
Thanks for carrying it for me.

453
00:30:34,090 --> 00:30:35,510
♫  Telling you you're beautiful  ♫

454
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:38,220
♫  No matter where you go or what you do  ♫

455
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:40,070
She makes me look bad every time. Wait for me.

456
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:44,600
♫  I will always be with you, My love.  ♫ 
 Wait for me!

457
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:06,870
- Put it over here.
 - Thank you.

458
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,720
The two of you came today.

459
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:15,230
Hello, I'm On Ma Eum.

460
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:18,200
We've met before, right? Nice to see you.

461
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:21,460
- You recognize me!
 - Of course.

462
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:23,610
Do you want something to drink? A coffee or drink?

463
00:31:23,610 --> 00:31:25,810
I'll take a glass of cold water.

464
00:31:25,810 --> 00:31:27,420
Me too.

465
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:42,220
- Here you go.
 - Thank you.

466
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,960
How refreshing.

467
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,180
Is that it?

468
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:51,610
- Water purifier that dispenses ice?
 - That's right.

469
00:31:51,610 --> 00:31:53,150
It's definitely more convenient.

470
00:31:53,150 --> 00:31:55,220
I was thinking of putting one in my house.

471
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:57,070
It's really nice.

472
00:31:57,070 --> 00:31:59,530
There was a package out front.

473
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:03,160
- They re-sent this.
 - What?

474
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:05,910
I ordered a mini air purifier a few days ago

475
00:32:05,910 --> 00:32:09,130
and they sent me a delivery confirmation with a picture.

476
00:32:09,130 --> 00:32:11,820
But by the time I came home, it wasn't there.

477
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:13,180
Did somebody steal it?

478
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:14,430
I don't know.

479
00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:18,050
I forgot to report the loss, but it came now.

480
00:32:18,050 --> 00:32:19,540
I already purchased a new one.

481
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:20,800
You have to return it then.

482
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,480
That's a hassle.

483
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,480
If one of you needs it, take it.

484
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:28,250
 She's so cool. 

485
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,810
 Shall we open up the box? 

486
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:38,030
 Pomme 

487
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:44,790
Done!

488
00:32:44,790 --> 00:32:47,680
Gosh, my hand hurts.

489
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:49,280
Isn't 100 too many?

490
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:50,710
I'm sorry.

491
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:52,800
I will suggest reducing the number of volumes next time.

492
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,050
That's okay.

493
00:32:54,050 --> 00:32:58,420
It'd be nice if more people could get one.

494
00:32:58,420 --> 00:33:02,070
And... here.

495
00:33:02,070 --> 00:33:05,680
Here is a storytelling PPL (Product Placement) proposal for this month and the product.

496
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:07,650
Please review and let me know your thoughts.

497
00:33:07,650 --> 00:33:09,570
I see...

498
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:15,710
It smells nice.

499
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:17,770
I'll review the proposal.

500
00:33:17,770 --> 00:33:21,700
Artist Pomme. You seem very kind.

501
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:24,330
Right? I'm different than what you heard from the company, right?

502
00:33:24,330 --> 00:33:26,170
Pardon? Comp—

503
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:27,070
What?

504
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:28,840
No-what?

505
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,850
I wasn't testing you. Don't worry.

506
00:33:30,850 --> 00:33:33,470
I have a pretty good idea what my reputation is.

507
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:37,700
Since you're so cute, On Ma Eum, I'm being especially kind today.

508
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,360
Why are you smiling?

509
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:45,990
No, it's not that.

510
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:48,570
What was so funny? The part that I am cute?

511
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:51,520
Or the part that I'm kind?

512
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:53,430
Both?

513
00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:55,610
What did you say?

514
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,450
Something is definitely there.

515
00:34:09,450 --> 00:34:12,890
Or else, there's no reason for that.

516
00:34:12,890 --> 00:34:14,410
I know.

517
00:34:14,410 --> 00:34:17,500
Why would they both...

518
00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:21,570
Who are you talking about?

519
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:25,250
- Who were you talking about, Hyeong?
 - Whoa.

520
00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:27,530
Heo Kwan Yeong! I was talking about him the whole time.

521
00:34:27,530 --> 00:34:29,550
You weren't listening to me. I'm getting "king" (pissed off–shortened slang) here.

522
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:31,060
Oh, I see.

523
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:33,130
Gosh, come on.

524
00:34:33,130 --> 00:34:36,200
Why are you using shortened slang words? It doesn't suit you.

525
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:38,700
It's not shortened slang. It's how young people talk these days.

526
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:41,520
Why? Are you pissed? Irritated? Because I use young people's language?*
(Using slang accent.)

527
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:43,920
You want to hit me? But you can't? Because I'm your hyeong?*
(Using slang accent.)

528
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:46,030
What will you do?*
 (Using slang accent, spewing any words now.)

529
00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:48,060
Gwangbokjeol*, the microwave.
(National Liberation Day, using slang accent, spewing any words now.)

530
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:49,740
Yes.

531
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:52,820
Who were you talking about?

532
00:34:55,070 --> 00:34:57,600
Who is it? Who would it be?

533
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,860
Who is it?

534
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:02,080
Artist Pomme...

535
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:05,300
I think she's hard to figure out.

536
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:06,730
How come?

537
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:09,210
Even though she seems stand-offish, somehow

538
00:35:09,210 --> 00:35:12,670
she seems very warmhearted.

539
00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:15,860
I think her cat was a res-cat too.

540
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,270
What is that?

541
00:35:18,270 --> 00:35:21,360
Well, a rescued abandoned animal.

542
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:24,110
She didn't mention it, but...

543
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:29,170
There are so many things in the world that you can't figure out.

544
00:35:29,170 --> 00:35:30,680
Right.

545
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:35,280
PD Kwon was at the start of Artist Pomme's career.

546
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,950
I know, right?

547
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:41,960
Artist Gu Seul Ah's decision must've been a meaningful one too.

548
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:46,110
Just like my reasons for making a certain choice.

549
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:49,700
Gosh, it's so tough!

550
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:52,850
I'm not sure if it's because I only played sports.

551
00:35:52,850 --> 00:35:55,350
Or if I'm still too young.

552
00:35:55,350 --> 00:35:59,050
I finally feel like I'm learning about the world.

553
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:02,240
I feel the same way.

554
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:05,580
I thought I broke out of the shell but ended up having similar worries again.

555
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:07,070
Yet I don't know the correct answer.

556
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:08,650
Even a smart person like you?

557
00:36:08,650 --> 00:36:09,830
Come on.

558
00:36:09,830 --> 00:36:12,400
It's doesn't mean I'm smart just because I did well academically.

559
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:15,660
Sometimes, I just have a lot of useless thoughts.

560
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:20,500
When you feel frustrated like that, use your "colleague chance" (ask for a helpful tip).

561
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:23,550
I'm a good listener even though I may not look like it.

562
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:26,620
Love your coworker and love your country!

563
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,940
Are you okay? You must be shocked.

564
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:44,790
What?

565
00:36:44,790 --> 00:36:46,810
Yes.

566
00:36:46,810 --> 00:36:48,960
Are you okay, Ma Eum?

567
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:51,390
Yes, I'm okay.

568
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:56,310
You don't feel anything?

569
00:36:56,310 --> 00:36:57,890
No.

570
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:00,370
Okay.

571
00:37:00,370 --> 00:37:01,880
That's good.

572
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:06,550
Gosh, the delivery motor scooters drive too recklessly these days.

573
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,500
I know.

574
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:15,660
I'm going to go home and drink beer before falling asleep.

575
00:37:16,630 --> 00:37:19,100
You don't know how great that feels, huh?

576
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:20,860
No.

577
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:24,430
A life without any fun from drinks...

578
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:29,280
♫  How is your day?  ♫

579
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,900
♫  How is your heart?  ♫

580
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:37,400
♫  Even though the day was intense, the night shines.  ♫

581
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:40,420
Get home safe.

582
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:41,960
I'm sorry for getting off first.

583
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:46,100
The person who lives closest should get off first.

584
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:49,750
Jun Yeong, your house is really nice too!

585
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:53,080
♫  The warmth of the blazing sun  ♫

586
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:54,650
Get home safe.

587
00:37:54,650 --> 00:37:55,980
Bye.

588
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:57,520
Please go, ajussi.

589
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:58,740
Bye!

590
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:01,210
♫  In this dark night when everyone is asleep-  ♫

591
00:38:01,210 --> 00:38:03,950
♫  I'm the only one who forgot to sleep  ♫

592
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:08,610
♫  My heart which shines like that far away starlight  ♫

593
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:16,200
♫  Like the star passing through distant time which reached me  ♫

594
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:19,990
♫  Will I also be able to shine?  ♫

595
00:38:19,990 --> 00:38:22,540
♫  How is your night?  ♫

596
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:25,350
♫  How is your heart?  ♫

597
00:38:25,350 --> 00:38:30,620
♫  Even though the day was intense, the night shines.  ♫

598
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:36,070
♫  For me everyday the star greets saying "Good day."  ♫

599
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:39,840
♫  It shines on my fading wish  ♫ 
  Upload 

600
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:45,700
♫  The whisper of the quiet night and the starlight cast on my room  ♫

601
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:51,870
♫   greeted tired me saying "great job"   ♫

602
00:38:51,870 --> 00:38:54,600
♫   In the dark night when everyone is asleep,  ♫

603
00:38:54,600 --> 00:39:00,100
 I thought crying and laughing while reading comics was stupid. 

604
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:03,030
 Thinking that the reality you have to face after 

605
00:39:03,030 --> 00:39:05,080
 would be the same. 

606
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:09,380
♫  Like the star passing through distant time which reached me  ♫

607
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:13,610
♫  Will I also be able to shine again?  ♫

608
00:39:13,610 --> 00:39:16,200
This is how he expressed that scene.

609
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:19,050
I see what he did. 
 ♫  How is your day  ♫

610
00:39:19,050 --> 00:39:21,100
Now that's more like it.

611
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:25,070
♫  A night dreaming dreams  ♫

612
00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:29,550
♫  which cheers for your heart  ♫

613
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:41,810
He changed this.

614
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:45,090
Hello.

615
00:39:45,090 --> 00:39:47,000
I was in the area and thought I'd stop by.

616
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,600
I wanted to say hi to Artist Gu.

617
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:49,580
Of course.

618
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:51,280
She's in her room.

619
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:53,830
Gosh, you didn't have to bring this.

620
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:59,500
Artist Gu, it's PD On.

621
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:02,350
Can I see you for a second?

622
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:07,480
Artist Gu?

623
00:40:23,210 --> 00:40:24,900
Artist Gu?

624
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:28,060
Artist Gu?

625
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:36,970
Artist Gu! Art—

626
00:40:36,970 --> 00:40:38,860
Ma'am!

627
00:40:40,690 --> 00:40:42,370
Oh, my God! Seul Ah!

628
00:40:42,370 --> 00:40:43,280
What's wrong with my Seul Ah?

629
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:45,110
- Is this 911?
 - Seul Ah!

630
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:46,840
Someone passed out.

631
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:48,170
She's unconscious.

632
00:40:48,170 --> 00:40:51,710
Was she okay last night?

633
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:05,440
Is this the hospital?

634
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:06,830
Are you awake now?

635
00:41:06,830 --> 00:41:09,460
You were passed out at home.

636
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:10,550
They said it's exhaustion,

637
00:41:10,550 --> 00:41:12,880
malnutrition, stress, lack of sleep.

638
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:15,710
What time is it? I have only a few days until my deadline.

639
00:41:15,710 --> 00:41:16,980
You can't do this.

640
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:20,680
The doctor said you need absolute calm and rest.

641
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:22,550
No, I can't.

642
00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:24,190
Then, I can't meet the deadline.

643
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:26,970
If you don't rest now, you'll be sicker longer.

644
00:41:26,970 --> 00:41:30,600
I will talk to the company, so don't worry.

645
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:41,010
I initially thought I only needed to change the hairstyle.

646
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:47,220
I thought I can meet the deadline if I worked without sleeping.

647
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:52,300
But after changing the hairstyle, I had to change the outfit.

648
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:58,400
And changes to the appearance also changed gestures.

649
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:01,880
Then, I had to change the overall composition.

650
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:07,240
I wanted to fix everything, but...

651
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,760
I had no time

652
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:15,270
so I slept less and less and eventually...

653
00:42:16,790 --> 00:42:19,250
It's okay. It's okay.

654
00:42:22,130 --> 00:42:25,380
She was discharged, but the doctor said she needs to rest a few more days.

655
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:28,410
She's accumulated too much fatigue.

656
00:42:28,410 --> 00:42:32,430
I can't believe it. Is she trying to show that she's an amateur?

657
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:38,030
Weren't we scheduled to send over the manuscripts to the web novel and drama people by this week?

658
00:42:38,030 --> 00:42:39,870
At this rate, we'll have to change the schedule.

659
00:42:39,870 --> 00:42:42,110
Why change the schedule?

660
00:42:42,110 --> 00:42:44,320
Change the artist.

661
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:49,450
PD Kwon, that's too harsh.

662
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:52,890
- What did I do?
 - If you stole my artist, at least,

663
00:42:52,890 --> 00:42:54,630
you should've taken care of her.

664
00:42:54,630 --> 00:42:56,580
Who stole whom?

665
00:42:56,580 --> 00:42:59,890
Artist Gu came to me because she had no hope working with you.

666
00:42:59,890 --> 00:43:04,420
And since when was Artist Gu yours? Is an artist your possession?

667
00:43:04,420 --> 00:43:07,110
That's not the point here.

668
00:43:07,110 --> 00:43:11,040
Didn't Artist Gu collapse because you changed the character all of a sudden?

669
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:14,910
Then you should at least show that you feel sorry about it.

670
00:43:14,910 --> 00:43:16,860
Why should I?

671
00:43:18,370 --> 00:43:21,770
Artist Gu had agreed to the schedule from the start.

672
00:43:21,770 --> 00:43:25,310
If she can't meet the deadline or can't perform according to the contract,

673
00:43:25,310 --> 00:43:29,040
the contract specifies that we can change the artist. She signed that.

674
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:32,120
Artist Gu also did that.

675
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:34,920
You are so harsh.

676
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:37,620
Newbie artists are not a product to be used or a tool.

677
00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:39,990
There are no webtoon artists who don't go through physical stress.

678
00:43:39,990 --> 00:43:41,590
Why are you overreacting?

679
00:43:41,590 --> 00:43:43,230
Is the artist above the company?

680
00:43:43,230 --> 00:43:45,670
The company hires artists by paying them!

681
00:43:45,670 --> 00:43:46,970
It's a contractual partnership.

682
00:43:46,970 --> 00:43:48,710
It's not a one-sided employment relationship.

683
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:51,690
That's enough. Huh?

684
00:43:51,690 --> 00:43:53,530
What are you doing in a meeting?

685
00:43:53,530 --> 00:43:57,560
We are all PDs in the same company fighting over my and your artist.

686
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:01,600
Change the schedule.

687
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:05,160
I know you want to have enough backup manuscripts, PD Kwon.

688
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:07,840
But we still have some time until the official launch of "Girl's Rule."

689
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:10,660
Just postpone the deadline for now.

690
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:14,040
- Okay? 
- Okay.

691
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:16,820
Finding a new artist also comes with a risk.

692
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:19,730
And PD On Ma Eum...

693
00:44:19,730 --> 00:44:22,900
I'll talk to her separately.

694
00:44:24,130 --> 00:44:26,270
He'll talk to you.

695
00:44:40,090 --> 00:44:41,870
My apologies.

696
00:44:50,790 --> 00:44:52,700
PD On Ma Eum.

697
00:44:52,700 --> 00:44:54,330
Yes.

698
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:57,860
Let's go for daytime drinking.

699
00:45:00,150 --> 00:45:01,860
- Pardon?
 - Why not? Can't we?

700
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:02,850
Can't we?

701
00:45:02,850 --> 00:45:04,520
This is also work-related.

702
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:07,580
Work. A meeting.

703
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:11,190
It's acceptable. It's good.

704
00:45:11,190 --> 00:45:13,470
Can I go too?

705
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:16,500
Why not? Let's go.

706
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:18,910
Gu Jun Yeong, you can't drink.

707
00:45:18,910 --> 00:45:21,580
He can drink a soda.

708
00:45:21,580 --> 00:45:23,520
Then, I will also...

709
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:26,210
Hey, Du Hui.

710
00:45:26,210 --> 00:45:28,750
Hey, we have to work!

711
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:33,230
Hurry up.

712
00:45:34,170 --> 00:45:36,120
We'll be back.

713
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:37,950
See you later.

714
00:45:37,950 --> 00:45:40,140
- See you.
 - Hey!

715
00:45:40,140 --> 00:45:42,710
Why can't you read the room?

716
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:51,300
Hey, what makes you so right that you keep losing your temper?

717
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:56,400
Today, was I so wrong?

718
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:58,560
Yeah! Very much so.

719
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:04,870
Honestly, it's true that the way PD Kwon works does feel a bit underhanded.

720
00:46:04,870 --> 00:46:07,460
Underhanded? What does that mean?

721
00:46:07,460 --> 00:46:09,310
Should justice be realized in our work?

722
00:46:09,310 --> 00:46:12,300
At the least, there are business ethics and morals.

723
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:16,540
PD Kwon didn't violate minimal business ethics and morals.

724
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:21,720
It's just that he's always narrowly walking on a tightrope.

725
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:25,460
It's not whether his work method is right or wrong.

726
00:46:25,460 --> 00:46:28,930
You either love his style or hate it. Is that what you're saying?

727
00:46:28,930 --> 00:46:30,700
Yeah!

728
00:46:32,220 --> 00:46:34,880
Why are you so generous toward just PD Kwon?

729
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:37,640
- That's not it—
- That's because

730
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:41,460
PD Kwon Yeong Bae manages webtoons that bring in the majority of sales

731
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:44,700
of our Webtoon Service Team.

732
00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:48,980
I studied it.

733
00:46:48,980 --> 00:46:51,610
About the financial strengths and weaknesses of our team.

734
00:46:51,610 --> 00:46:54,920
In order for the team to flourish in the future, which parts should be strengthened.

735
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:56,430
I see.

736
00:46:56,430 --> 00:46:58,110
Really?

737
00:46:58,110 --> 00:47:00,310
I found out while analyzing this.

738
00:47:00,310 --> 00:47:05,180
PD Kwon Yeong Bae manages projects that have high sales and profit margins.

739
00:47:05,180 --> 00:47:07,380
 IRS People 
He discovers success-guaranteed originals

740
00:47:07,380 --> 00:47:09,540
 and brings in newbie artists at a low cost, 

741
00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:13,350
 creating daebak titles. He came up with this system that works for him. 

742
00:47:13,350 --> 00:47:17,170
The projects that PD Kwon managed took up a high percentage

743
00:47:17,170 --> 00:47:20,260
in the secondary copyright sales or overseas sales.

744
00:47:20,260 --> 00:47:21,880
You know it well.

745
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:23,760
But he's still your superior.

746
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:27,120
Addressing him as "PD Kwon, PD Kwon" is kind of rude. Don't you think?

747
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:30,900
In the end, sales and performance are everything.

748
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:31,960
So?

749
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:35,090
So? Are you disappointed in all of us?

750
00:47:35,090 --> 00:47:36,680
Even though, because of his performance

751
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:40,660
we have a reason to keep working for this company?

752
00:47:46,270 --> 00:47:48,810
Even PD Kwon Yeong Bae

753
00:47:53,610 --> 00:47:57,000
wasn't always this way in the beginning.

754
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,830
He was also like you in the beginning, On Ma Eum.

755
00:47:59,830 --> 00:48:03,950
Just like you, he was also passionate at one time.

756
00:48:05,690 --> 00:48:07,200
 I'm Kwon Yeong Bae from GingerToon. 

757
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:09,130
  
 Hello, hello. 

758
00:48:09,130 --> 00:48:12,500
 Hello. I'm here. 

759
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:16,290
 Artist! Hello! 

760
00:48:16,290 --> 00:48:18,700
 PD Kwon, what brings you here on a weekend? 

761
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:20,520
 I was passing by and saw a fruit truck. 

762
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:24,340
 Then I was reminded of you. You resemble this too. 

763
00:48:24,340 --> 00:48:26,910
 You are not even my manager. No need for that. 

764
00:48:26,910 --> 00:48:29,080
 You're a salaryman, yet you're not even resting on a weekend. 

765
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:30,940
 Gosh, resting isn't that important. 

766
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:35,200
 Bringing you over to GingerToon is more important. Don't you know? 

767
00:48:35,900 --> 00:48:38,780
 I'll go and cut the watermelon. 

768
00:48:41,050 --> 00:48:43,550
 Whoa, it's ripe. 

769
00:48:43,550 --> 00:48:45,230
 For your health, sir... 

770
00:48:45,230 --> 00:48:48,660
 I also made you some orange juice. 

771
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:51,240
 Gosh. Thank you, PD Kwon. 

772
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:52,990
 I'm being treated so nicely working on my deadline, thanks to you. 

773
00:48:52,990 --> 00:48:55,670
 Don't mention it. Enjoy. 

774
00:48:55,670 --> 00:48:57,900
 Let's see. 

775
00:48:57,900 --> 00:49:00,300
 This is for you, Yeong Han. 

776
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:02,610
  is for you, Jo Han. 

777
00:49:15,710 --> 00:49:19,540
 If GingerToon signs on Artist Mo... 

778
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:21,320
 Hold on. 

779
00:49:22,350 --> 00:49:24,860
  
 Do you see this? 

780
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:28,810
 Yes, Artist Mo. 

781
00:49:28,810 --> 00:49:31,100
 PD Kwon, I've decided. 

782
00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:33,350
 I'll do my new project with GingerToon. 

783
00:49:33,350 --> 00:49:35,510
 C-co-contract? 

784
00:49:35,510 --> 00:49:37,550
 Let's make wonderful comics together. 

785
00:49:37,550 --> 00:49:39,340
 Absolutely! 

786
00:49:39,340 --> 00:49:40,690
 Of course, we will. 

787
00:49:40,690 --> 00:49:42,140
 You have to make it with me. 

788
00:49:42,140 --> 00:49:44,240
 I'll go over right now, so we can start making it! 

789
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:46,370
 Yes! Yes! 

790
00:49:46,370 --> 00:49:48,000
 - Oh, wait.
 - Hey. 

791
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,060
 - Wh-What happened?
 - We did it! 

792
00:49:50,060 --> 00:49:51,330
 We did it! 

793
00:49:51,330 --> 00:49:53,710
  - We did it!
- Wh-What? 

794
00:49:54,660 --> 00:49:56,320
 You did it? 

795
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:03,370
I can't imagine it knowing how PD Kwon is now.

796
00:50:03,370 --> 00:50:06,380
If he was like that, why is he so...

797
00:50:09,010 --> 00:50:12,130
 CEO! What do you mean terminate the service? 

798
00:50:12,130 --> 00:50:13,590
 Does this make sense? 

799
00:50:13,590 --> 00:50:16,300
 We just persuaded famous artists and signed contracts! 

800
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:19,000
 It's just the beginning. What do you mean terminate the service all of a sudden? 

801
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,070
 CEO! 

802
00:50:21,070 --> 00:50:23,720
 So, you should've sold more. 

803
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:25,910
 Who said to have a deficit? 

804
00:50:26,850 --> 00:50:28,870
 You, Heo Kwan Yeong! 

805
00:50:30,380 --> 00:50:32,220
 Kwan Yeong. 

806
00:50:32,220 --> 00:50:35,070
 Do you really have to go this far? 

807
00:50:35,070 --> 00:50:37,750
 We are only asking for a little more time. 

808
00:50:37,750 --> 00:50:41,660
 A little, a little, a little... 

809
00:50:41,660 --> 00:50:44,330
 Exactly until when? 

810
00:50:44,330 --> 00:50:47,280
 Until the company files for bankruptcy? 

811
00:50:53,340 --> 00:50:56,720
 Did the company not give you a chance? 

812
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:58,890
 Let's stop this now. 

813
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:01,340
 Let's go. 

814
00:51:01,340 --> 00:51:03,700
 There are so many people working on the service team! 

815
00:51:03,700 --> 00:51:05,770
 Did you build up this department? 

816
00:51:05,770 --> 00:51:07,350
 - We built it!
 - Yeong Bae! 

817
00:51:07,350 --> 00:51:09,120
 Yeong Bae! Yeong Bae... 

818
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:12,650
 We all built this service together! 

819
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:15,460
 CEO! 

820
00:51:17,380 --> 00:51:20,380
 I'll do a better job! 

821
00:51:20,380 --> 00:51:23,760
 Please give me one more chance! 

822
00:51:27,910 --> 00:51:30,710
 Hyeong Man Cheol, this is wrong... 

823
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:35,620
 Ji Hyeong, this is just wrong! 

824
00:51:37,940 --> 00:51:40,840
 We worked so hard! 

825
00:51:42,290 --> 00:51:44,980
 You did well. I'm sorry. 

826
00:51:44,980 --> 00:51:47,360
 I'm sorry... 

827
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:49,620
 - Of course, we'll issue a refund.
 - Of course... 

828
00:51:49,620 --> 00:51:52,140
 - I'm very sorry.
 - We just found out too... 

829
00:51:52,140 --> 00:51:54,150
 We're trying to figure out what's next... 

830
00:51:54,150 --> 00:51:56,010
 Yes, we'll let you know when we decide. 

831
00:51:56,010 --> 00:51:57,630
 I'll let you know. 

832
00:51:57,630 --> 00:52:00,520
 - Hello?
 - Hello? Yes... 

833
00:52:15,060 --> 00:52:17,680
 I'm so sorry, Artist Mo. 

834
00:52:18,730 --> 00:52:20,840
 Are you kidding me right now? 

835
00:52:21,630 --> 00:52:26,610
 You have no idea what kind of offers I declined to go with GingerToon. 

836
00:52:26,610 --> 00:52:31,400
 And only after just three months, the service is terminated? 

837
00:52:32,740 --> 00:52:34,270
 I'm very sorry. 

838
00:52:34,270 --> 00:52:36,710
 I have nothing to say. 

839
00:52:36,710 --> 00:52:38,240
 It's all my fault. 

840
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:42,310
 I'll make sure your work is released on another platform. 

841
00:52:42,310 --> 00:52:44,680
 I can't even stand the sight of you. 

842
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:47,060
 Get lost. 

843
00:52:47,060 --> 00:52:50,000
 - Sir.
 - I said get the f*** out now! 

844
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,720
 PD Kwon, you may not know since you are a salaryman who gets paid regularly. 

845
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:56,850
 But I have to pay studio rent, maintenance, assistants' salaries. 

846
00:52:56,850 --> 00:53:00,870
 Even if I'm doing nothing but breathing, we're talking 10 million won! 

847
00:53:00,870 --> 00:53:03,370
 And now that the series is canceled all of a sudden, 

848
00:53:03,370 --> 00:53:06,010
 I'm the only one losing out here! 

849
00:53:06,010 --> 00:53:07,880
 Let's say it's possible to re-release the series. 

850
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:10,620
 How would you take care of the money I'm losing 

851
00:53:10,620 --> 00:53:13,550
 in the meantime while I'm twiddling my thumbs idly? 

852
00:53:17,770 --> 00:53:20,030
 I'm very sorry. 

853
00:53:21,310 --> 00:53:25,110
 Since I'm starting this new series, I hired new assistants! 

854
00:53:25,110 --> 00:53:28,330
 What do I do with them? Do I fire them right after hiring them? 

855
00:53:28,330 --> 00:53:32,700
 I'm responsible for many people's lives. 

856
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:37,240
 I'm different than a salaryman like you who has 

857
00:53:37,240 --> 00:53:40,820
 nothing at risk, working within a company. 

858
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:06,850
 In the end, she asked for a divorce. 

859
00:54:06,850 --> 00:54:08,320
Hey...

860
00:54:09,310 --> 00:54:12,550
Do you know what Artist Moh said to me?

861
00:54:12,550 --> 00:54:14,420
That I'm...

862
00:54:15,710 --> 00:54:21,290
a salaryman working within a company without having anything to risk.

863
00:54:21,290 --> 00:54:24,050
 Without anything at risk... 

864
00:54:27,610 --> 00:54:30,560
 Is this not having anything at risk? 

865
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:40,280
 Hey, Ji Hyeong. 

866
00:54:40,300 --> 00:54:42,800
 What is it, Hyeong? 

867
00:54:42,910 --> 00:54:45,610
 Did I do something wrong? 

868
00:54:46,410 --> 00:54:49,750
 Did I live wrongly? 

869
00:54:49,750 --> 00:54:55,700
 I just made cartoons that I wanted to make! 

870
00:54:55,700 --> 00:54:59,020
 That's all I did! 

871
00:55:00,100 --> 00:55:02,460
 You did that too! 

872
00:55:12,310 --> 00:55:19,210
Luckily, all the members of GingerToon Editorial Department got hired by Neon.

873
00:55:20,940 --> 00:55:25,420
- But as for PD Kwon... 
 - He became a totally different person.

874
00:55:28,570 --> 00:55:35,120
Had I known earlier, Artist Seul Ah wouldn't have gone over to PD Kwon.

875
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:37,240
Do you think so?

876
00:55:39,030 --> 00:55:42,430
So far, everyone who worked with PD Kwon

877
00:55:42,430 --> 00:55:45,430
all knew about the rumor surrounding him.

878
00:55:45,430 --> 00:55:50,750
They just thought they'd be different and started working with him.

879
00:55:50,750 --> 00:55:55,130
Of course, Artist Seul Ah probably didn't know. That's not it.

880
00:55:55,130 --> 00:56:00,440
Even if she knew about it, she could've made the same choice.

881
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:02,430
- But—
 - It's probably

882
00:56:02,430 --> 00:56:06,720
because you have to think about the company profit as a deputy editor.

883
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:12,660
Actually, PD On Ma Eum or other PDs putting in the time on specific artists and taking care of them

884
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:18,380
is possible only because PD Kwon is making sales with his marketable webtoons.

885
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:24,840
PD Kwon plays a huge role in the fact that our PDs can afford to

886
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:27,210
choose projects that they believe in.

887
00:56:27,210 --> 00:56:33,110
If we don't hit the numbers consistently, we'll lose a lot more.

888
00:56:35,450 --> 00:56:38,230
Anyway, since that incident,

889
00:56:38,230 --> 00:56:41,480
he became a PD who chases after hit projects and sales.

890
00:56:42,060 --> 00:56:44,910
He's a stickler when it comes to work and life balance.

891
00:56:44,910 --> 00:56:51,080
The reason for producing webtoons that were proven web novel successes happened ever since then.

892
00:57:02,860 --> 00:57:05,450
 Here is this week's manuscript 

893
00:57:06,790 --> 00:57:10,540
 Meet the deadline while maintaining quality. 

894
00:57:10,540 --> 00:57:13,780
 That's the only thing I expect from webtoon artists. 

895
00:57:13,780 --> 00:57:16,310
 Because a webtoon is a product. 

896
00:57:21,060 --> 00:57:23,160
 NEON 

897
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:27,590
I'm off now.

898
00:57:27,590 --> 00:57:30,600
- Okay, see you later.
 - Bye.

899
00:57:34,770 --> 00:57:39,910
Of course, I also know that PD Kwon crosses the line at times.

900
00:57:39,910 --> 00:57:41,300
But...

901
00:57:41,300 --> 00:57:43,290
but...

902
00:57:44,130 --> 00:57:47,910
I couldn't just criticize him.

903
00:57:49,170 --> 00:57:54,440
Now that I'm here, I don't ever want to experience that ever again.

904
00:57:58,900 --> 00:58:02,350
I didn't know that our team had such a story.

905
00:58:02,350 --> 00:58:04,230
Me neither.

906
00:58:06,210 --> 00:58:09,650
I still can't understand PD Kwon completely.

907
00:58:09,650 --> 00:58:11,740
I think I get it a little bit.

908
00:58:11,740 --> 00:58:17,040
When your work becomes a part of you, you encounter difficult moments.

909
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:21,260
Would we also face those moments?

910
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:25,730
I'm not sure.

911
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:44,230
See?

912
00:58:44,230 --> 00:58:46,880
I knew you could do it quickly.

913
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:49,680
I didn't do it quickly.

914
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:53,590
I did it by not even sleeping two hours a day.

915
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:56,660
I redrew most of the drawings.

916
00:58:56,660 --> 00:58:57,790
Oh, okay.

917
00:58:57,790 --> 00:58:59,610
I know. I got it.

918
00:58:59,610 --> 00:59:01,270
You did great.

919
00:59:01,270 --> 00:59:03,390
This character will be fixed this way.

920
00:59:03,390 --> 00:59:06,700
So you just have to move forward with the story as scheduled.

921
00:59:06,700 --> 00:59:07,860
Okay?

922
00:59:07,860 --> 00:59:10,150
Then, I'll get going now.

923
00:59:10,150 --> 00:59:11,610
Oh, that's right.

924
00:59:11,610 --> 00:59:14,020
I'm only asking just in case.

925
00:59:14,020 --> 00:59:18,020
After this project is over, are you interested in another coloring job?

926
00:59:18,020 --> 00:59:21,250
If you want, you can do both simultaneously.

927
00:59:21,250 --> 00:59:25,980
There's already a rumor saying they love your drawings in this industry.

928
00:59:25,980 --> 00:59:28,970
I'm working on launching another webtoon based on another original web novel.

929
00:59:28,970 --> 00:59:31,840
They want to work with you, Artist Gu Seul Ah.

930
00:59:35,120 --> 00:59:38,650
No. I won't do it.

931
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:43,290
- Why not? 
- I'm trying to finish the current project out of a sense of responsibility.

932
00:59:43,290 --> 00:59:46,690
It's also a test of my limitation.

933
00:59:46,690 --> 00:59:49,850
But I don't want to do any more than that.

934
00:59:52,020 --> 00:59:54,700
I like webtoons.

935
00:59:55,350 --> 00:59:58,200
I don't want to hate it.

936
00:59:58,200 --> 01:00:01,800
I don't want to hate myself for drawing them, either.

937
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:04,420
But while working with you,

938
01:00:04,420 --> 01:00:09,240
I kept hating myself and webtoons.

939
01:00:10,950 --> 01:00:14,790
I don't want to go through this again with another project.

940
01:00:20,900 --> 01:00:25,350
But once you finish this project, you'll probably change your mind if it's successful.

941
01:00:25,350 --> 01:00:27,270
Don't make up your mind in advance.

942
01:00:27,270 --> 01:00:30,480
You just never know how a person's heart will change.

943
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:34,850
No. I don't think I'll ever change my mind about this.

944
01:00:34,850 --> 01:00:40,310
After this series ends, even if it takes a long time,

945
01:00:40,310 --> 01:00:43,500
I want to draw a story that only I can create.

946
01:00:46,740 --> 01:00:49,290
I'll get going then.

947
01:00:59,600 --> 01:01:03,760
Going forward, please contact me using email only if possible.

948
01:01:38,420 --> 01:01:41,460
 Neon, Old subscribers / NRU, Not Recently Used 

949
01:01:44,440 --> 01:01:48,250
Artist Gu Seul Ah doesn't want to work on the webtoon "MiSingles."

950
01:01:48,250 --> 01:01:52,260
I thought it'd be tough to work on it at the same time so I asked her to start as soon as this series ends.

951
01:01:52,260 --> 01:01:54,160
But she says no.

952
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:56,400
Really?

953
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:58,930
- Nothing we can do.
 - Yeah.

954
01:01:58,930 --> 01:02:02,440
I'll have to search for another quick and smart artist.

955
01:02:02,440 --> 01:02:05,010
- Good work.
 - Sure.

956
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:08,400
PD Kwon.

957
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:10,200
Yes?

958
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:12,200
Thank you.

959
01:02:15,320 --> 01:02:17,010
Why? Out of the blue?

960
01:02:17,010 --> 01:02:21,120
Because I know how difficult it is to play a villain at work.

961
01:02:21,120 --> 01:02:24,590
Because of an incompetent superior, you are taking on that role.

962
01:02:24,590 --> 01:02:26,960
I'm grateful for that.

963
01:02:28,090 --> 01:02:29,210
A villain?

964
01:02:29,210 --> 01:02:30,920
I'm just doing my job. I'm working.

965
01:02:30,920 --> 01:02:32,910
Work and earn a salary.

966
01:02:32,910 --> 01:02:34,790
That's all.

967
01:02:35,630 --> 01:02:37,680
Still. That's a tough thing to do.

968
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:40,150
Working as much as your pay.

969
01:02:40,150 --> 01:02:43,660
And I guess that's the biggest virtue for a salaryman?

970
01:02:52,040 --> 01:02:53,680
I'm going now.

971
01:02:54,610 --> 01:02:57,550
A little bit more...

972
01:02:57,550 --> 01:02:59,650
I think it's much better.

973
01:02:59,650 --> 01:03:02,810
If you revise it...

974
01:03:10,110 --> 01:03:12,600
 Our PDs can afford to choose projects that they believe in.
 

975
01:03:12,600 --> 01:03:15,060
 That's because PD Kwon Yeong Bae 

976
01:03:15,060 --> 01:03:17,720
 manages webtoons that bring in majority sales 
   

977
01:03:17,720 --> 01:03:20,870
 of our webtoon service team. 
   

978
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:27,330
Yes, Artist Oh.

979
01:03:27,330 --> 01:03:29,610
"Origin of Mankind" series has been approved.

980
01:03:29,610 --> 01:03:35,030
As you said, we can build up its worldview gradually in SF.

981
01:03:35,030 --> 01:03:38,010
- Yes.
 - No, instead of an obvious story this time around,

982
01:03:38,010 --> 01:03:40,220
how about a little dark romance?

983
01:03:40,220 --> 01:03:41,760
Romance thriller.

984
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:43,460
Even if the number of hits are low in the beginning,

985
01:03:43,460 --> 01:03:46,120
I think it will be all right if we consider the copyrights for the movie.

986
01:03:46,120 --> 01:03:48,430
If things are consistent, apart from the number of hits,

987
01:03:48,430 --> 01:03:51,370
I think weekly earnings will look good too.

988
01:04:06,180 --> 01:04:07,530
I'm off first.

989
01:04:07,530 --> 01:04:08,930
See you.

990
01:04:08,930 --> 01:04:10,300
Take care.

991
01:04:10,300 --> 01:04:12,630
Thank you.

992
01:04:12,630 --> 01:04:14,580
Good evening.

993
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:21,900
 A workplace is not a place for self-actualization. 

994
01:04:23,040 --> 01:04:25,350
 I'm an office worker. 

995
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:39,260
♫  How's your day?  ♫

996
01:04:39,260 --> 01:04:41,950
♫  How's your heart?  ♫

997
01:04:41,950 --> 01:04:47,260
♫  Intense day but still a bright tonight  ♫

998
01:04:47,260 --> 01:04:49,840
♫  Every day is my birthday  ♫

999
01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:52,500
♫  I feel like a clumsy child  ♫

1000
01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:56,610
♫  Everything is fresh as if I'm reborn  ♫

1001
01:04:56,610 --> 01:04:59,240
♫  Small whispers in the winds  ♫

1002
01:04:59,240 --> 01:05:02,230
♫  Warmth of the sun rays  ♫

1003
01:05:02,230 --> 01:05:06,510
♫  Greeting me when I'm tired  ♫

1004
01:05:06,510 --> 01:05:08,510
♫  Saying, good job  ♫

1005
01:05:08,510 --> 01:05:11,230
♫  Everyone's sleeping in this dark night  ♫

1006
01:05:11,230 --> 01:05:13,810
♫  I'm the only one forgotten to sleep  ♫

1007
01:05:13,810 --> 01:05:18,420
♫  Like starts that are shining my heart  ♫

1008
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:21,810
♫  Cozy time passes  ♫

1009
01:05:21,810 --> 01:05:25,900
♫  Like a sunny star to me, yeah  ♫

1010
01:05:25,900 --> 01:05:29,330
 Today's Webtoon 

1011
01:05:29,330 --> 01:05:32,920
 PD On Ma Eum, you have a great sensibility as a PD. 

1012
01:05:32,920 --> 01:05:36,570
 How do you want your new artists to grow? 

1013
01:05:36,570 --> 01:05:38,920
 The reason why the webtoon category should not be left out here. 

1014
01:05:38,920 --> 01:05:41,700
 Write out a report on that. 

1015
01:05:41,700 --> 01:05:44,550
 Artist Na Gang Nam is here— 

1016
01:05:44,550 --> 01:05:47,540
 Don't show that in front of Artist Im Dong Hui. 

1017
01:05:47,540 --> 01:05:51,370
 Sometimes irresponsible kindness is more harmful than malice. 

1018
01:05:51,370 --> 01:05:53,600
 Somebody destroyed my laptop! 

1019
01:05:53,600 --> 01:05:55,480
 My storyboards are all gone. 

1020
01:05:55,480 --> 01:05:58,650
 Everything from beginning to the end. The whole thing! 

1021
01:06:00,250 --> 01:06:07,310
