00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:07,970


2
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:34,080
 Today's Webtoon

00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:01,490
 Gu Jun Yeong's Past 

4
00:01:01,493 --> 00:01:03,831
 You know the study abroad program that you applied for? 

5
00:01:03,831 --> 00:01:05,311
 Did they announce the results today? 

6
00:01:05,311 --> 00:01:06,711
 How did it turn out? 

7
00:01:06,711 --> 00:01:10,364
 I got in, but I'm not going. 

8
00:01:12,398 --> 00:01:13,421
 Why not? 

9
00:01:13,421 --> 00:01:15,424
 I thought that was an amazing opportunity. 

10
00:01:15,424 --> 00:01:18,264
 They give a full scholarship, too. 

11
00:01:18,264 --> 00:01:20,721
 I calculated my living expenses. 

12
00:01:20,721 --> 00:01:22,281
 - I don't think it'll work. 
- Hey. 

13
00:01:22,281 --> 00:01:25,911
 We may live with our uncle's family, but I have some money, you know. 

14
00:01:25,911 --> 00:01:28,444
 What money do you have? 

15
00:01:29,521 --> 00:01:31,691
 I can earn the money, but 

16
00:01:31,691 --> 00:01:34,551
 you shouldn't miss a chance like this, Jun Yeong. 

17
00:01:35,861 --> 00:01:37,521
 What about you? 

18
00:01:38,281 --> 00:01:40,431
 What about your studies? 

19
00:01:40,431 --> 00:01:42,461
 You couldn't graduate because you were working to support me. 

20
00:01:42,461 --> 00:01:45,601
 After you become successful, I'll make you pay me back, including interest. 

21
00:01:45,601 --> 00:01:48,981
 I'll kill you if you don't accept this opportunity.   

22
00:01:50,531 --> 00:01:52,251
 Sorry... 

23
00:01:53,851 --> 00:01:55,801
 Don't be sorry... 

24
00:01:56,781 --> 00:01:59,431
 Why are you so down? This is good news. 

25
00:01:59,431 --> 00:02:01,221
 Fighting! 

26
00:02:02,191 --> 00:02:05,981
 - Fighting. 
 - Fighting! 

27
00:02:08,091 --> 00:02:09,181
 Fighting! 

28
00:02:09,181 --> 00:02:12,171
 - Fighting!
 - Fighting! 

29
00:02:12,171 --> 00:02:17,321
 The last thing I told my sister at the airport was also "Fighting." 

30
00:02:18,071 --> 00:02:21,081
 To someone who was already giving it her all. 

31

 R.I.P. Gu Ae Ri, Maria

 Episode 11: You Always Let Me Know That I'm Also a Flower. 

33
00:03:05,738 --> 00:03:07,821
Deputy Editor.

34
00:03:07,821 --> 00:03:10,461
I want to ask you something.

35
00:03:10,461 --> 00:03:13,201
Sure. What is it?

36
00:03:17,001 --> 00:03:19,031
Do you know this person?

37
00:03:33,021 --> 00:03:35,481
How do you know Ae Ri?

38
00:03:36,931 --> 00:03:39,351
Jun Yeong! Hey!

39
00:03:39,351 --> 00:03:41,411
How do you know that person?

40
00:03:41,411 --> 00:03:42,964
He's the one!

41
00:03:42,964 --> 00:03:45,534
The one who caused Ae Ri's death.

42
00:03:57,691 --> 00:03:59,571
Deputy Editor!

43
00:03:59,571 --> 00:04:02,881
- Yeah?
 - They want to finish the last drink and head out.

44
00:04:02,881 --> 00:04:05,751
- Okay, I'll be right in.
 - Okay!

45
00:04:10,591 --> 00:04:12,511
Let's go in for now.

46
00:04:23,771 --> 00:04:25,161
Come on now.

47
00:04:25,161 --> 00:04:27,461
- He's not leaving!
 - That Young Toon...

48
00:04:27,461 --> 00:04:29,041
He's not leaving!

49
00:04:29,041 --> 00:04:30,861
- Why would he go? 
- No! For sure.

50
00:04:30,861 --> 00:04:33,181
- Hey, hey!
- Ji Hyeong!

51
00:04:33,181 --> 00:04:36,791
Seok Ji Hyeong!

52
00:04:36,791 --> 00:04:40,490
PD Gu! You're our hope, PD Gu!

53
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:41,790
Come on! Hurry up!

54
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:43,880
Get in here!

55
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:46,141
Hurry up and come!

56
00:04:47,221 --> 00:04:48,621
Come, come!

57
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:50,661
Wow, let's sit around...

58
00:04:50,661 --> 00:04:52,811
Hey, hey. We were waiting to do our last toast.

59
00:04:52,811 --> 00:04:56,211
- To Neon Editorial Department!
 - Cheers!

60
00:04:56,211 --> 00:04:59,224
Cheers!

61
00:05:02,451 --> 00:05:04,191
Cheers.

62
00:05:09,451 --> 00:05:11,671
Second round, right, PD On?

63
00:05:11,671 --> 00:05:13,041
Oh, second round...

64
00:05:13,041 --> 00:05:14,981
Geez, it's been so long...

65
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:17,661
I have to go home and see Ji Ho!

66
00:05:17,661 --> 00:05:18,951
Just tell her to come!

67
00:05:18,951 --> 00:05:21,911
- Tell her to come. 
- You're crazy!

68
00:05:21,911 --> 00:05:25,201
Hey, I'll go ahead then.

69
00:05:25,811 --> 00:05:27,751
- Bye now.
 - Bye!

70
00:05:27,751 --> 00:05:29,241
PD Kwon, wait!

71
00:05:29,241 --> 00:05:31,801
- Your shoes. Wait a minute!
 - Bye!

72
00:05:31,801 --> 00:05:33,491
My gosh! Seriously!

73
00:05:33,491 --> 00:05:34,531
What the hell!

74
00:05:34,531 --> 00:05:35,821
PD Gi!

75
00:05:35,821 --> 00:05:37,431
Goodbye! I'm off now!

76
00:05:37,431 --> 00:05:39,131
Bye!

77
00:05:39,131 --> 00:05:40,781
Goodbye!

78
00:05:40,781 --> 00:05:43,361
Let's go for a second round! Second and third round!

79
00:05:43,361 --> 00:05:45,331
Let's go! Let's party!

80
00:05:45,331 --> 00:05:47,441
- Let's go!
 - Yes, let's go now!

81
00:05:47,441 --> 00:05:48,751
Let's go, let's go.

82
00:05:48,751 --> 00:05:49,771
Let's go.

83
00:05:49,771 --> 00:05:50,871
- Mandu.
 - Yes.

84
00:05:50,871 --> 00:05:52,301
When did you get so drunk?

85
00:05:52,301 --> 00:05:53,601
I'm not drunk.

86
00:05:53,601 --> 00:05:54,731
You're drunk.

87
00:05:54,731 --> 00:05:56,401
Let's go for a second round. Forever!

88
00:05:56,401 --> 00:05:57,471
Okay, okay!

89
00:05:57,471 --> 00:05:59,611
To speak about it...

90
00:05:59,611 --> 00:06:01,631
So what is manwha (cartoon, comics, webtoon)?

91
00:06:01,631 --> 00:06:03,861
- Manhwa is my heart. 
- Manhwa is...

92
00:06:03,861 --> 00:06:08,101
afully bloomed flower. Never buy the fully bloomed rice cake.

93
00:06:08,101 --> 00:06:11,551
Oh, okay. Ma Eum, I'll drop off Hyeong Man Cheol.

94
00:06:11,551 --> 00:06:13,241
Let's do the second round next time.

95
00:06:13,241 --> 00:06:15,891
I'm not disappointed at all.

96
00:06:15,891 --> 00:06:18,121
There's always a next time.

97
00:06:18,121 --> 00:06:21,321
- Get home safely.
 - Okay.

98
00:06:21,321 --> 00:06:23,041
- Who is it?
 - A taxi. It's a taxi.

99
00:06:23,041 --> 00:06:26,301
Oh, hello! Hello!

100
00:06:26,301 --> 00:06:28,061
Your leg. Your leg.

101
00:06:28,061 --> 00:06:30,611
- I'll put it in.
 - My leg.

102
00:06:30,611 --> 00:06:32,061
Hyeong, I'll go with you.

103
00:06:32,061 --> 00:06:33,361
- You'll go with me? 
- Yes.

104
00:06:33,361 --> 00:06:34,961
- Ji Hyeong, will you go with me? 
- Yes.

105
00:06:34,961 --> 00:06:37,431
Okay. Ji Hyeong is going with me.

106
00:06:37,431 --> 00:06:40,880
I'm so happy that you're not leaving!

107
00:06:43,071 --> 00:06:45,251
- Bye now.
 - Bye.

108
00:06:45,251 --> 00:06:46,821
I'm off.

109
00:06:46,821 --> 00:06:49,411
See you tomorrow.

110
00:06:49,411 --> 00:06:52,001
Goodbye!

111
00:07:01,561 --> 00:07:03,251
I have to call a taxi.

112
00:07:03,251 --> 00:07:04,521
Are you that happy?

113
00:07:04,521 --> 00:07:08,201
Yeah. We can keep working together.

114
00:07:10,351 --> 00:07:11,661
I'll take a walk before I go home.

115
00:07:11,661 --> 00:07:13,011
Really?

116
00:07:13,011 --> 00:07:14,211
A taxi—

117
00:07:14,211 --> 00:07:15,771
To sober up...

118
00:07:15,771 --> 00:07:17,951
Should I walk with you then?

119
00:07:17,951 --> 00:07:19,781
No.

120
00:07:19,781 --> 00:07:21,801
Be careful going home.

121
00:07:31,081 --> 00:07:32,841
Ji Hyeong.

122
00:07:32,841 --> 00:07:35,401
- Ji Hyeong! Ji Hyeong, Ji Hyeong!
 - Yes, yes?

123
00:07:35,401 --> 00:07:38,141
Ji Hyeong, Ji Hyeong, I'm sorry...

124
00:07:38,141 --> 00:07:41,091
I'm sorry. I'm...

125
00:07:41,091 --> 00:07:45,661
I'm so sorry that I held you back twice now.

126
00:07:45,661 --> 00:07:47,711
What's with you?

127
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:51,061
But what I feel really bad about is that

128
00:07:51,061 --> 00:07:54,131
although I feel so bad

129
00:07:54,131 --> 00:07:57,181
I keep holding on, so you won't go.

130
00:07:57,181 --> 00:08:01,201
Because I keep asking you not to go.

131
00:08:03,851 --> 00:08:06,231
I'm so sorry.

132
00:08:06,231 --> 00:08:09,231
It's my choice because I want to stay.

133
00:08:59,561 --> 00:09:01,081
- It's Yu Na. 
- No way.

134
00:09:01,081 --> 00:09:03,741
Geez, stop it now.

135
00:09:03,741 --> 00:09:04,831
Let's toast. Cheers.

136
00:09:04,831 --> 00:09:06,761
Cheers!

137
00:09:10,511 --> 00:09:13,051
Hey, it's him.

138
00:09:13,051 --> 00:09:14,811
It's Gu Jun Yeong.

139
00:09:14,811 --> 00:09:17,221
- It's Gu Jun Yeong.
 - It is him.

140
00:09:17,221 --> 00:09:19,440
Hey, Gu Jun Yeong!

141
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,430
Why is he here?

142
00:09:22,741 --> 00:09:26,111
Hey, Gu Jun Yeong. What brings you here?

143
00:09:26,111 --> 00:09:27,701
I live here.

144
00:09:29,661 --> 00:09:33,131
Since you don't like alumni get-togethers, we didn't call you.

145
00:09:33,131 --> 00:09:36,001
Wow, what a coincidence.

146
00:09:36,692 --> 00:09:39,945
I did wonder when I saw the reservation number.

147
00:09:39,945 --> 00:09:43,705
Is our salary so low that he needs a part-time job like this?

148
00:09:44,491 --> 00:09:48,201
Jun Yeong, you can let us check out late, right?

149
00:09:51,081 --> 00:09:52,901
Enjoy your stay.

150
00:09:55,781 --> 00:10:00,121
Geez, he has nothing to show for, yet acts like he's all that.

151
00:10:04,841 --> 00:10:07,321
 FB Bank 

152
00:10:07,321 --> 00:10:10,211
 Please take your cash. 

153
00:10:10,211 --> 00:10:12,711
 Thank you for using our service. 

154
00:10:20,551 --> 00:10:23,011
Please tell me now, Uncle.

155
00:10:31,221 --> 00:10:32,261
Thank you for this food.

156
00:10:32,261 --> 00:10:35,021
Athlete On Ma Eum, here she takes one spoonful.

157
00:10:35,021 --> 00:10:37,211
Going for the second bite—

158
00:10:37,211 --> 00:10:39,801
You want to get slapped around?

159
00:10:39,801 --> 00:10:41,811
Eonni must not even have hangovers.

160
00:10:41,811 --> 00:10:43,511
I have to eat to ease my tummy.

161
00:10:43,511 --> 00:10:46,191
True, true.

162
00:10:46,191 --> 00:10:48,241
Have breakfast.

163
00:10:49,801 --> 00:10:51,521
Thank you for the meal.

164
00:10:51,521 --> 00:10:53,091
Why? Finish up.

165
00:10:53,091 --> 00:10:54,691
No, I'm done.

166
00:10:54,691 --> 00:10:56,801
Relax and finish the rest.

167
00:11:03,851 --> 00:11:06,341
Eonni, did you argue with Dad again?

168
00:11:07,051 --> 00:11:08,801
No.

169
00:11:29,741 --> 00:11:33,221
 On Ma Eum, Toward 2024 Paris Olympics! 

170
00:11:57,421 --> 00:11:59,561
I heard everything.

171
00:11:59,561 --> 00:12:02,181
She couldn't return it and is sitting on it.

172
00:12:02,181 --> 00:12:04,484
You went too far this time.

173
00:12:04,484 --> 00:12:07,754
How do you think she felt when she went all the way there?

174
00:12:09,451 --> 00:12:11,351
Poor Ma Eum's maeum. (Maeum means heart.)

175
00:12:11,351 --> 00:12:14,541
- Give your dad some toasted seaweed.
 - Yes, Mother.

176
00:12:23,521 --> 00:12:25,381
Deputy Editor!

177
00:12:25,381 --> 00:12:26,711
Geez, you scared me.

178
00:12:26,711 --> 00:12:27,901
Good morning!

179
00:12:27,901 --> 00:12:29,601
You're overflowing with energy this morning.

180
00:12:29,601 --> 00:12:31,431
Yes, I'm overflowing with energy especially this morning.

181
00:12:31,431 --> 00:12:34,401
At this rate, I think I can even go for mountain field training.

182
00:12:34,401 --> 00:12:36,491
Hey, hey. Stop doing that.

183
00:12:36,491 --> 00:12:37,991
Okie.

184
00:12:38,921 --> 00:12:40,791
Hi.

185
00:12:42,751 --> 00:12:44,411
Hello.

186
00:12:44,411 --> 00:12:47,151
Hey, good morning.

187
00:12:49,121 --> 00:12:50,901
Did you get home okay last night?

188
00:12:50,901 --> 00:12:52,391
Yeah.

189
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,950
 The doors are closing.  

190
00:13:05,531 --> 00:13:08,091
And you two aren't using honorifics anymore.

191
00:13:08,091 --> 00:13:09,641
Oh, no. We're the same age.

192
00:13:09,641 --> 00:13:11,661
We decided to be friends.

193
00:13:11,661 --> 00:13:13,501
Good going.

194
00:13:25,241 --> 00:13:26,511
Oh, hello.

195
00:13:26,511 --> 00:13:27,681
Hello.

196
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:30,161
Aigoo, our Webtoon Service Team.

197
00:13:30,161 --> 00:13:32,061
You all are coming in early out of the blue.

198
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:33,121
Oh, yes...

199
00:13:33,121 --> 00:13:35,611
Anyway, what brings you all the way here, Director?

200
00:13:35,611 --> 00:13:36,961
Just because.

201
00:13:36,961 --> 00:13:39,951
I thought I'd have some coffee with Team Leader Jang Man Cheol.

202
00:13:39,951 --> 00:13:41,781
But he's still not in yet.

203
00:13:41,781 --> 00:13:43,851
Oh, yes. I'll tell him you came by.

204
00:13:43,851 --> 00:13:45,041
No, no.

205
00:13:45,041 --> 00:13:46,971
I stopped by because I thought

206
00:13:46,971 --> 00:13:51,101
I was being too distant all this time considering our connections.

207
00:13:51,101 --> 00:13:54,501
So that Webtoon Team could be worthy of the name Neon,

208
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:57,551
I'd like to support you wholeheartedly starting now too.

209
00:13:59,691 --> 00:14:01,991
Okay, we'll do our very best!

210
00:14:09,091 --> 00:14:12,711
Gu Jun Yeong, you should do your best as well.

211
00:14:14,311 --> 00:14:17,061
Have a wonderful day.

212
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:20,680
 The doors are closing.  

213
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,801
Hey, hey, hey!

214
00:14:25,141 --> 00:14:27,641
Be careful getting back, Director.

215
00:14:30,711 --> 00:14:32,190
Okay.

216
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:34,540
 The doors are closing. 

217
00:14:44,471 --> 00:14:45,691
You go ahead.

218
00:14:45,691 --> 00:14:47,841
I want to talk to Jun Yeong before going in.

219
00:14:47,841 --> 00:14:50,811
Oh, okay.

220
00:14:50,811 --> 00:14:54,041
Come this way for a moment.

221
00:15:10,581 --> 00:15:13,531
I don't think we finished our conversation last night.

222
00:15:16,321 --> 00:15:18,270
You and Ae Ri

223
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:21,730
What is the nature of your relationship?

224
00:15:21,731 --> 00:15:24,981
What was your relationship to her?

225
00:15:27,431 --> 00:15:30,081
We used to work at GingerToon together.

226
00:15:30,081 --> 00:15:32,331
She was a contractor, right?

227
00:15:32,981 --> 00:15:35,701
She was the first one to get laid off.

228
00:15:36,411 --> 00:15:38,721
Please disregard the photo you saw last night.

229
00:15:38,721 --> 00:15:41,461
I don't think you'd be that concerned anyhow.

230
00:15:59,781 --> 00:16:01,891
What is it regarding?

231
00:16:02,841 --> 00:16:06,361
Do you remember Ae Ri who we used to work with at GingerToon?

232
00:16:07,881 --> 00:16:08,791
Yes.

233
00:16:08,791 --> 00:16:10,941
Do you know if she has any other family members?

234
00:16:10,941 --> 00:16:12,741
That day at the funeral,

235
00:16:12,741 --> 00:16:15,981
I remember her relatives taking care of her funeral.

236
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:18,331
She had a younger brother.

237
00:16:18,331 --> 00:16:21,454
She was taking care of him after her parents passed away.

238
00:16:21,454 --> 00:16:25,324
He was overseas and couldn't come back in time for the funeral.

239
00:16:27,341 --> 00:16:28,511
I see.

240
00:16:28,511 --> 00:16:32,211
But why do you ask about that out of the blue?

241
00:16:32,211 --> 00:16:34,711
No, nothing.

242
00:16:41,181 --> 00:16:43,261
He was dreadful.

243
00:16:43,261 --> 00:16:48,091
He threw the bait saying that he'd hire her full time and whatnot and worked her to death.

244
00:16:48,091 --> 00:16:51,461
He let her go as soon as her contract was up. My goodness...

245
00:16:51,461 --> 00:16:55,951
Do you think Ae Ri would have died like that if that hadn't happened?

246
00:16:55,951 --> 00:16:59,601
I mean, perhaps if you hadn't gone to study abroad...

247
00:17:18,381 --> 00:17:21,031
- Ta-da!
 - Aigoo...

248
00:17:21,031 --> 00:17:22,771
What is all this?

249
00:17:22,771 --> 00:17:24,541
You know, my family runs a sushi restaurant.

250
00:17:24,541 --> 00:17:27,651
When I said I'm coming to visit you, she packed all of this.

251
00:17:27,651 --> 00:17:29,771
I told you to just come over.

252
00:17:29,771 --> 00:17:32,481
Instead, I'll eat two bowls of your food, ma'am.

253
00:17:32,481 --> 00:17:34,691
Aigoo, not two bowls.

254
00:17:34,691 --> 00:17:36,461
Eat three bowls.

255
00:17:36,461 --> 00:17:38,051
Yes, ma'am!

256
00:17:38,051 --> 00:17:40,041
Hyeong, have you been doing well?

257
00:17:40,041 --> 00:17:41,061
Of course.

258
00:17:41,061 --> 00:17:43,791
You're looking good.

259
00:17:45,191 --> 00:17:47,241
Daebak!

260
00:17:47,241 --> 00:17:49,711
The surprise guest has arrived as well.

261
00:17:49,711 --> 00:17:51,951
I'll go.

262
00:17:55,101 --> 00:17:56,911
Welcome.

263
00:17:59,701 --> 00:18:01,891
Hi, Dae Ryuk.

264
00:18:01,891 --> 00:18:03,981
Hello.

265
00:18:05,491 --> 00:18:07,741
Long time no see.

266
00:18:09,261 --> 00:18:10,931
Hello.

267
00:18:10,931 --> 00:18:13,921
You must be busy with your deadlines.

268
00:18:17,431 --> 00:18:19,911
Ma Eum, aren't you going to eat?

269
00:18:19,911 --> 00:18:22,241
I have some things to take care of.

270
00:18:22,241 --> 00:18:24,061
You've never turned down food.

271
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:25,451
Enjoy your lunch.

272
00:18:25,451 --> 00:18:27,951
But you should still eat.

273
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,800
She must be swamped. Be sure to eat later.

274
00:18:30,811 --> 00:18:32,801
Let's go.

275
00:18:32,801 --> 00:18:35,631
Don't they even see me?

276
00:18:35,631 --> 00:18:37,561
Ji Hyeong, let's eat.

277
00:18:37,561 --> 00:18:38,941
- You're not eating.
 - Yes...

278
00:18:38,941 --> 00:18:41,101
Hey, wait up!

279
00:18:46,151 --> 00:18:49,211
- Eat after you're done.
 - Okay.

280
00:19:04,243 --> 00:19:09,371
We'll get to feast on sashimi today, thanks to Dong Hui.

281
00:19:09,371 --> 00:19:11,111
- Please eat.
 - Yes.

282
00:19:11,111 --> 00:19:13,251
- Thank you for this food.
 - Let's eat.

283
00:19:13,251 --> 00:19:14,961
Yes.

284
00:19:19,401 --> 00:19:23,321
I'm really enjoying "Peeve Weapon."

285
00:19:23,321 --> 00:19:24,541
Be sure to publish it in a book format.

286
00:19:24,541 --> 00:19:26,491
I'll definitely buy the set.

287
00:19:26,491 --> 00:19:28,221
Okay.

288
00:19:30,331 --> 00:19:33,551
And you came all the way here just because I'm here.

289
00:19:33,551 --> 00:19:36,011
You've changed a lot.

290
00:19:36,011 --> 00:19:38,351
I came to see you

291
00:19:38,351 --> 00:19:40,561
because I missed you...

292
00:19:46,401 --> 00:19:47,981
Yeah...

293
00:19:47,981 --> 00:19:51,141
I missed you, too.

294
00:20:04,151 --> 00:20:07,251
He's here! Whoa!

295
00:20:07,251 --> 00:20:08,711
You didn't go to lunch yet?

296
00:20:08,711 --> 00:20:11,301
I wanted to eat with you.

297
00:20:11,301 --> 00:20:14,161
I don't feel like it. Go and enjoy.

298
00:20:14,161 --> 00:20:17,281
So, you eat with your feelings? I eat with my mouth.

299
00:20:17,281 --> 00:20:18,621
Come on, let's go eat together!

300
00:20:18,621 --> 00:20:20,161
I heard something yummy is on the menu today.

301
00:20:20,161 --> 00:20:22,951
- No.
 - Let's go...

302
00:20:22,951 --> 00:20:25,444
I'm hungry. I'm starving.

303
00:20:25,444 --> 00:20:27,704
I'm starving.

304
00:20:29,161 --> 00:20:30,611
Okay, let's go.

305
00:20:30,611 --> 00:20:32,121
Okay. Let's go!

306
00:20:32,121 --> 00:20:34,041
Let's go!

307
00:20:45,071 --> 00:20:49,271
Wow, the steak is really good today. Try it.

308
00:20:52,651 --> 00:20:54,421
It's good, huh? Right?

309
00:20:54,421 --> 00:20:56,221
It's good.

310
00:20:57,051 --> 00:20:59,271
Everything is okay, right?

311
00:20:59,271 --> 00:21:03,041
You seem a bit down.

312
00:21:03,041 --> 00:21:04,711
No...

313
00:21:08,151 --> 00:21:10,051
Hey, Gu Jun Yeong.

314
00:21:10,051 --> 00:21:11,971
Eating lunch now?

315
00:21:13,931 --> 00:21:15,111
Hello.

316
00:21:15,111 --> 00:21:16,821
Webtoon team member?

317
00:21:16,821 --> 00:21:19,371
Yes, I'm On Ma Eum from Webtoon Service Team.

318
00:21:19,371 --> 00:21:20,621
I'm Gu Jun Yeong's colleague.

319
00:21:20,621 --> 00:21:22,801
I don't think I've seen you before.

320
00:21:22,801 --> 00:21:24,891
Oh, our team hired me separately.

321
00:21:24,891 --> 00:21:27,321
You probably don't know me.

322
00:21:27,321 --> 00:21:31,121
That Webtoon Team contractor, a former judo athlete?

323
00:21:32,171 --> 00:21:35,391
Yes! I guess I'm pretty famous?

324
00:21:35,391 --> 00:21:37,251
If you're here to eat, just eat.

325
00:21:37,251 --> 00:21:38,611
Hey, are you still pissed?

326
00:21:38,611 --> 00:21:41,421
I actually said it that night in consideration of you.

327
00:21:41,421 --> 00:21:44,681
People always bowed to you saying you were born with a silver spoon in your mouth.

328
00:21:44,681 --> 00:21:46,591
But I thought you didn't have a chance to explain

329
00:21:46,591 --> 00:21:48,011
so I helped you out.

330
00:21:48,011 --> 00:21:51,761
And if we knew you had to work a part-time job as lodging customer service,

331
00:21:51,761 --> 00:21:54,531
we would've taken care of you better. You know?

332
00:21:55,291 --> 00:21:58,611
If you get to live in that house without paying rent, it is a sweet part-time job for sure.

333
00:21:58,611 --> 00:22:01,751
- Right?
 - Thanks for thinking of me.

334
00:22:03,891 --> 00:22:06,311
You all heard, right?

335
00:22:06,311 --> 00:22:08,731
I feel much better now that I got to explain myself.

336
00:22:08,731 --> 00:22:10,511
As you say.

337
00:22:18,271 --> 00:22:20,721
Jun Yeong's colleagues.

338
00:22:23,481 --> 00:22:25,361
The more you do this, the more it highlights your inferiority complex.

339
00:22:25,361 --> 00:22:26,961
What?

340
00:22:35,487 --> 00:22:37,521
Don't worry about people like them.

341
00:22:37,521 --> 00:22:39,481
I don't worry about them.

342
00:22:40,081 --> 00:22:41,951
But you're angry.

343
00:22:44,001 --> 00:22:46,161
Doesn't it make you angry?

344
00:22:46,161 --> 00:22:49,071
Why do you smile there like a fool?

345
00:22:49,071 --> 00:22:50,531
It's true that I was a former athlete.

346
00:22:50,531 --> 00:22:52,121
And it's true that I'm a contractor.

347
00:22:52,121 --> 00:22:54,841
I'm working hard in my team.

348
00:22:54,841 --> 00:22:56,921
We just have to show them through our team performance.

349
00:22:56,921 --> 00:22:59,011
- So—
 - "Our team"?

350
00:22:59,811 --> 00:23:02,551
Fine. Within "Our team,"

351
00:23:02,551 --> 00:23:05,011
do you think there will be a spot for you?

352
00:23:06,691 --> 00:23:08,081
Gu Jun Yeong.

353
00:23:08,081 --> 00:23:09,921
I'll go ahead.

354
00:23:25,521 --> 00:23:27,271
Jun Yeong.

355
00:23:30,561 --> 00:23:32,871
- Ae Ri and you—
 - Yes.

356
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:36,600
She was my one and only family and my older sister.

357
00:24:17,551 --> 00:24:19,281
 "Our team"? 

358
00:24:20,891 --> 00:24:25,411
 Within "Our team," do you think there will be a spot for you? 

359
00:24:42,021 --> 00:24:43,971
Let's do it one more time.

360
00:24:45,471 --> 00:24:47,521
Did something happen?

361
00:24:48,211 --> 00:24:50,531
What's wrong? It's not like you.

362
00:24:54,421 --> 00:24:57,461
I don't know why I'm so angry.

363
00:24:59,851 --> 00:25:03,361
Why am I so upset that he had said that?

364
00:25:11,181 --> 00:25:13,031
Are you crying?

365
00:25:14,361 --> 00:25:16,591
No, wiping sweat.

366
00:25:27,931 --> 00:25:30,731
Enough, enough. It hurts.

367
00:25:30,731 --> 00:25:33,111
How much longer will you live like this?

368
00:25:33,111 --> 00:25:35,541
You're at an age where you should work less.

369
00:25:35,541 --> 00:25:38,721
But you're working more hours trying to learn the computer.

370
00:25:38,721 --> 00:25:39,931
How could your body endure it?

371
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,000
It's not a computer. It's a tablet.

372
00:25:43,051 --> 00:25:45,691
Gosh, how can you laugh?

373
00:25:45,691 --> 00:25:47,191
Of course, I'd laugh.

374
00:25:47,191 --> 00:25:49,691
Would I cry over this?

375
00:25:49,691 --> 00:25:51,380
- Gosh, I can't stand it!

376
00:26:29,501 --> 00:26:31,471
I'm home.

377
00:26:31,471 --> 00:26:33,201
Eonni.

378
00:26:34,721 --> 00:26:36,781
Look at this.

379
00:26:37,691 --> 00:26:38,871
What is it?

380
00:26:38,871 --> 00:26:41,491
The parody of your webtoon.

381
00:26:41,491 --> 00:26:46,841
This is about Sunday Blues where it's being eaten by Peeve and is superimposed.

382
00:26:46,841 --> 00:26:48,851
It's totally hilarious...

383
00:26:48,851 --> 00:26:50,021
It's funny.

384
00:26:50,021 --> 00:26:53,421
It's gone viral in all kinds of variations.

385
00:26:54,001 --> 00:26:55,961
Hey, oh, right.

386
00:26:55,961 --> 00:26:57,001
What?

387
00:26:57,001 --> 00:26:58,981
Look at this.

388
00:26:58,981 --> 00:27:01,371
Webtoon Witch...

389
00:27:01,981 --> 00:27:05,221
 Artist Sin Dae Ryuk's "Peeve Weapon." 

390
00:27:05,221 --> 00:27:08,381
 It's totally crossing the line. 

391
00:27:08,381 --> 00:27:10,151
 The thrill that crosses the boundary. 

392
00:27:10,151 --> 00:27:11,451
 The fun that crosses the boundary. 

393
00:27:11,451 --> 00:27:15,571
 This is Neon's real hidden weapon. Don't you think? 

394
00:27:15,571 --> 00:27:20,301
 The biggest attraction to "Peeve Weapon" is the storyline that is completely unpredictable. 

395
00:27:20,301 --> 00:27:22,181
 Including the dynamic production quality... 

396
00:27:22,181 --> 00:27:25,501
Isn't that amazing? I can't believe this Witch is giving out compliments.

397
00:27:25,501 --> 00:27:27,081
 The difference between an idiot and a genius is a difference in a sheet of paper... 

398
00:27:27,081 --> 00:27:29,851
She's very precise!

399
00:27:29,851 --> 00:27:32,711
- She says it's fun if it's fun...
  - But still, are you sure about the drawings? 

400
00:27:32,711 --> 00:27:36,991
- I know. I thought she was just a troll.
  - "Peeve Weapon" is just... 

401
00:27:36,991 --> 00:27:39,911
I'll send it to Artist Sin Dae Ryuk.

402
00:27:42,411 --> 00:27:43,841
Why are you picking a fight?

403
00:27:43,841 --> 00:27:45,561
- What?
 - What?

404
00:27:45,561 --> 00:27:48,421
- What?
 - What? S***...

405
00:27:48,421 --> 00:27:50,391
Sorry.

406
00:27:51,491 --> 00:27:52,941
Seriously...

407
00:28:20,271 --> 00:28:23,941
 You Always Let Me Know That I'm Also a Flower. 

408
00:28:26,471 --> 00:28:30,701
 You Always Let Me Know That I'm Also a Flower 

409
00:28:45,201 --> 00:28:46,840
 Neon, Kwon Yeong Bae 

410
00:28:51,251 --> 00:28:55,011
 PD Kwon's revenue portion was a lot larger than everyone else's. 

411
00:28:55,011 --> 00:28:59,801
 I'd like to see his artist candidates or a list of researched information. 

412
00:28:59,801 --> 00:29:03,491
 Well, that's PD Kwon's personal documents... 

413
00:29:03,491 --> 00:29:05,291
 Kwon Yeong Bae 

414
00:29:05,291 --> 00:29:08,611
  - PD Kwon. 
 - You won't get it but take a look. Look all you want. 

415
00:29:08,611 --> 00:29:12,871
 And if you have an idea that can help us, then think about that. 

416
00:29:18,521 --> 00:29:22,110
 Kwon Yeong Bae, additional files 

417
00:29:39,251 --> 00:29:45,240
 Editor Jang Man Cheol 

418
00:30:16,131 --> 00:30:18,721
Wait...

419
00:30:21,921 --> 00:30:24,021
- Yes.
 - PD Choi!

420
00:30:24,021 --> 00:30:25,841
What's wrong, Artist Oh?

421
00:30:25,841 --> 00:30:28,481
They keep showing up in my dream.

422
00:30:28,481 --> 00:30:30,031
Who?

423
00:30:30,031 --> 00:30:32,801
"Origin of Mankind" main characters.

424
00:30:32,801 --> 00:30:35,061
They show up in my dream

425
00:30:35,911 --> 00:30:38,551
and ask me not to abandon them.

426
00:30:40,031 --> 00:30:44,721
 Because I don't listen to them despite their cries, they were all shooting me today. 

427
00:30:44,721 --> 00:30:46,691
First, let's stop playing shooting games.

428
00:30:46,691 --> 00:30:49,881
I can hardly sleep these days!

429
00:30:50,991 --> 00:30:53,391
The last episode today...

430
00:30:53,391 --> 00:30:55,471
Must you really upload it?

431
00:30:55,471 --> 00:30:57,141
You already finished working on it.

432
00:30:57,141 --> 00:31:00,221
I'll do my best to help you in your next project.

433
00:31:00,221 --> 00:31:02,191
All right.

434
00:31:03,021 --> 00:31:04,171
I have to accept it.

435
00:31:04,171 --> 00:31:05,641
I'll come by soon.

436
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:08,500
 I have to accept it, right? PD Choi! 

437
00:31:08,551 --> 00:31:10,231
What now?

438
00:31:10,231 --> 00:31:14,241
- Didn't I get more gray hair? 
- Hey.

439
00:31:14,241 --> 00:31:18,181
The gray hair, wrinkles, and alcohol consumption

440
00:31:18,181 --> 00:31:20,931
are proportional to an editor's experience.

441
00:31:21,847 --> 00:31:24,521
Today's Artist Gu Seul Ah's final episode, right?

442
00:31:24,521 --> 00:31:25,741
That's right.

443
00:31:25,741 --> 00:31:30,301
Artist Gu Seul Ah's Season 1 finale is today.

444
00:31:30,301 --> 00:31:34,811
Gosh, we're both finishing the series, but "The Girl's Rule" is finishing up number one

445
00:31:34,811 --> 00:31:37,041
and "Origin of Mankind" is ranked...

446
00:31:37,041 --> 00:31:39,511
Gosh, really...

447
00:31:39,511 --> 00:31:42,851
Good work, PD Choi.

448
00:31:42,851 --> 00:31:45,491
I'm most envious of you these days, PD On.

449
00:31:45,491 --> 00:31:48,361
- Me? Why?
 - "Peeve Weapon" hit it big!

450
00:31:48,361 --> 00:31:50,131
I'm so jealous.

451
00:31:50,131 --> 00:31:52,781
I'm envious of PD On and Artist Sin both.

452
00:31:52,781 --> 00:31:56,471
But still... our team is doing well. You should congratulate them.

453
00:31:56,471 --> 00:32:00,011
Right. Our team is doing well.

454
00:32:03,151 --> 00:32:05,021
I'm good as long as PD On succeeds.

455
00:32:05,021 --> 00:32:06,471
 "Our team"? 

456
00:32:06,471 --> 00:32:10,381
 Do you think you're included in "Our team"?
 

457
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,700
 Full Count 

458
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:34,800
  "Please, Time Machine" confirmed to be transformed into a webtoon 

459
00:32:34,921 --> 00:32:35,921
 "Peeve Weapon" 

460
00:32:35,921 --> 00:32:39,231
Do you think this is enough?

461
00:32:39,231 --> 00:32:42,221
To go up against Director Heo Kwan Yeong?

462
00:32:43,411 --> 00:32:47,591
Director Heo is moving toward taking over Young Toon.

463
00:32:49,371 --> 00:32:52,821
- Young Toon? 
 - If our webtoon team stays this way,

464
00:32:52,821 --> 00:32:57,251
I have no reason... to oppose him this time around.

465
00:32:57,251 --> 00:32:59,161
Once we take over Young Toon,

466
00:32:59,161 --> 00:33:03,721
I don't need to tell you that the current team will be chopped liver, right?

467
00:33:05,111 --> 00:33:10,881
I want to keep the current webtoon service team.

468
00:33:10,881 --> 00:33:13,531
It's a team I chose and brought in.

469
00:33:13,531 --> 00:33:18,731
If the team gets kicked out due to poor performance, how embarrassing is that?

470
00:33:18,731 --> 00:33:20,981
So, please give me a reason.

471
00:33:20,981 --> 00:33:24,461
A reason to keep the current webtoon team.

472
00:33:24,461 --> 00:33:27,561
If I can't find that reason by the next executives' meeting,

473
00:33:27,561 --> 00:33:32,531
I guess that's it for Webtoon Team.

474
00:33:45,451 --> 00:33:47,001
We keep running into each other lately.

475
00:33:47,001 --> 00:33:48,911
You must be working hard.

476
00:33:49,541 --> 00:33:52,191
Of course, I should work hard, since you give us so much attention.

477
00:33:52,191 --> 00:33:54,031
This isn't enough.

478
00:33:54,031 --> 00:33:57,461
I'll be paying greater attention to you.

479
00:33:57,461 --> 00:34:00,241
As much work as you all put in.

480
00:34:00,241 --> 00:34:01,711
Yes.

481
00:34:03,031 --> 00:34:04,911
Get back to work.

482
00:34:09,491 --> 00:34:10,991
What brings you to the headquarters?

483
00:34:10,991 --> 00:34:13,391
I have some files to deliver.

484
00:34:15,811 --> 00:34:17,761
PD Gu.

485
00:34:24,971 --> 00:34:27,111
Go on to that office.

486
00:34:27,111 --> 00:34:29,201
I'll see you at our office.

487
00:34:34,311 --> 00:34:36,781
Why exactly aren't you going there?

488
00:34:36,781 --> 00:34:41,221
Like artist, like editor.

489
00:34:41,221 --> 00:34:43,491
Honey, are you continuing "Gumiho Princess"?

490
00:34:43,491 --> 00:34:46,711
I heard you two are working on a new series at Young Toon.

491
00:34:46,711 --> 00:34:48,321
Why aren't you eating?

492
00:34:48,321 --> 00:34:51,181
What is it? That's what you told me!

493
00:34:51,181 --> 00:34:54,721
Wait a minute.  What is she talking about?

494
00:34:57,563 --> 00:35:01,181
The short series that I started at Young Toon, "Cold-blooded."

495
00:35:01,181 --> 00:35:02,731
The response is totally hot. Hot!

496
00:35:02,731 --> 00:35:05,911
Gosh. Of course, I know about that.

497
00:35:05,911 --> 00:35:09,841
I even suggested that we should do a long series as a spinoff.

498
00:35:09,841 --> 00:35:11,581
I definitely said so!

499
00:35:11,581 --> 00:35:14,801
I know. I thought you meant to do that together at Young Toon.

500
00:35:14,801 --> 00:35:18,051
Since Deputy Editor Jang Hye Mi said exactly the same thing.

501
00:35:19,771 --> 00:35:22,961
Artist Na Gang Nam should do his spinoff with us, no matter what.

502
00:35:22,961 --> 00:35:24,651
We're the ones who turned it into a big hit.

503
00:35:24,651 --> 00:35:27,751
How nasty of you to try to swipe the long series from us?

504
00:35:27,751 --> 00:35:29,381
Why don't you abide by business ethics?

505
00:35:29,381 --> 00:35:32,331
I mean, it was a manuscript that Artist Na had already put together.

506
00:35:32,331 --> 00:35:34,591
It's not produced by Young Toon.

507
00:35:34,591 --> 00:35:36,741
I guess you must be nervous.

508
00:35:36,741 --> 00:35:38,681
But that's not going to change anything.

509
00:35:38,681 --> 00:35:41,801
A ship that's capsizing will eventually sink.

510
00:35:41,801 --> 00:35:43,921
Don't you know after having gone through it already?

511
00:35:50,511 --> 00:35:52,581
Well, that's that...

512
00:35:54,091 --> 00:35:58,411
Do you remember Ae Ri who used to work with us at GingerToon?

513
00:35:58,411 --> 00:36:00,311
You remember her, right?

514
00:36:01,481 --> 00:36:02,411
Gu Ae Ri?

515
00:36:02,411 --> 00:36:05,751
We had a newbie join our team recently.

516
00:36:05,751 --> 00:36:08,991
He says he's Ae Ri's younger brother.

517
00:36:08,991 --> 00:36:12,011
I haven't been able to tell Hyeong Man Cheol anything yet.

518
00:36:12,011 --> 00:36:14,571
I just don't know what to do.

519
00:36:15,371 --> 00:36:18,911
What do you think, Hye Mi?

520
00:36:20,741 --> 00:36:25,311
Why are you asking me that right now?

521
00:36:26,381 --> 00:36:29,321
Since we were on the same team at one time.

522
00:36:33,601 --> 00:36:35,751
What was your relationship to him?

523
00:36:35,751 --> 00:36:37,781
Team Leader Jang

524
00:36:38,761 --> 00:36:44,221
In the previous company, I shut down his team.

525
00:36:47,081 --> 00:36:48,761
I'm sure you know it well since you've experienced them.

526
00:36:48,761 --> 00:36:52,231
They're truly ineffective.

527
00:36:52,231 --> 00:36:55,301
Did you prepare the files I mentioned last time?

528
00:36:55,301 --> 00:36:57,941
I can't give them to you just yet.

529
00:36:59,651 --> 00:37:01,821
Not yet, huh?

530
00:37:01,821 --> 00:37:05,201
If the files you recently requested of me were to get leaked or handed to our competitor,

531
00:37:05,201 --> 00:37:09,300
they could have an impact on the Webtoon Team's potential revenue.

532
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:14,000
I'm still determining whether turning over such files to you

533
00:37:14,061 --> 00:37:15,794
would be beneficial or not.

534
00:37:15,794 --> 00:37:17,534
Determining, huh?

535
00:37:19,331 --> 00:37:22,821
Gu Jun Yeong is making a decision?

536
00:37:24,371 --> 00:37:26,261
Hey.

537
00:37:26,261 --> 00:37:29,321
Only I make those kinds of decisions.

538
00:37:29,321 --> 00:37:35,061
By chance, do you want to get yourself out of this now?

539
00:37:35,061 --> 00:37:38,181
I think you've kind of crossed the line here.

540
00:37:38,181 --> 00:37:42,541
Then, how about what you've done before this?

541
00:37:42,541 --> 00:37:48,261
The files you sent me already are in violation of company security policy just the same.

542
00:37:48,261 --> 00:37:50,811
Oh, that's not it.

543
00:37:50,811 --> 00:37:54,091
The official log is still with the Security Team.

544
00:37:54,091 --> 00:37:56,961
I guess that could be a bigger issue.

545
00:37:59,101 --> 00:38:02,191
Don't you think it would be an issue for you, Director?

546
00:38:03,481 --> 00:38:04,211
What?

547
00:38:04,211 --> 00:38:08,411
How much would a newbie like me have to lose?

548
00:38:09,371 --> 00:38:15,531
It would probably be a huge issue for the executive who requested it.

549
00:38:21,931 --> 00:38:24,251
 Grocery List 

550
00:38:27,091 --> 00:38:29,761
Artist Sin, their pork hock is very delicious.

551
00:38:29,761 --> 00:38:33,251
Should I buy one to have it as a snack?

552
00:38:33,251 --> 00:38:35,481
You said you want to eat black bean noodles before.

553
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:39,000
The black bean noodles is a meal and this is a snack.

554
00:38:39,091 --> 00:38:41,701
You eat... p-pork hock... as a snack...

555
00:38:41,701 --> 00:38:44,621
Is it a little too much?

556
00:38:44,621 --> 00:38:47,461
Then should I buy a medium?

557
00:38:47,461 --> 00:38:49,341
Yes, sure...

558
00:38:50,238 --> 00:38:52,091
Oh, yeah! I have to buy detergent.

559
00:38:52,091 --> 00:38:54,551
Hold on a moment.

560
00:38:54,551 --> 00:38:59,171
Then, I'll buy that one.

561
00:39:06,451 --> 00:39:10,421
Then I'll let you get it.

562
00:39:10,421 --> 00:39:11,951
Okay.

563
00:39:18,391 --> 00:39:19,711
Welcome.

564
00:39:19,711 --> 00:39:22,621
One medium pork hock, please.

565
00:39:22,621 --> 00:39:24,451
The large is on sale.

566
00:39:24,451 --> 00:39:26,231
Take a large.

567
00:39:26,231 --> 00:39:29,381
No. Give me a medium.

568
00:39:29,381 --> 00:39:30,841
Okay.

569
00:39:30,841 --> 00:39:33,631
What kind of sauce would you like?

570
00:39:33,631 --> 00:39:35,751
Sauce?

571
00:39:36,451 --> 00:39:38,931
 Shrimp sauce, rice sauce, spicy mustard 

572
00:39:42,851 --> 00:39:46,891
Just give me whatever you can give me.

573
00:39:46,891 --> 00:39:49,041
Enjoy.

574
00:39:51,621 --> 00:39:53,521
Thank you.

575
00:40:39,291 --> 00:40:41,491
 It's your turn, Jun Yeong. 

576
00:40:41,491 --> 00:40:43,231
 Okay. 

577
00:40:43,231 --> 00:40:45,441
 Smile. Bigger, bigger. 

578
00:40:45,441 --> 00:40:47,211
 My tummy. It hurts! 

579
00:40:47,211 --> 00:40:49,951
 So funny 

580
00:40:49,951 --> 00:40:52,481
♫  How is your heart?  ♫

581
00:40:52,481 --> 00:40:57,731
♫  Even though the day was intense, the night shines.  ♫

♫  Everyday is my birthday.  ♫

♫  I'm like a awkward child  ♫

584
00:41:04,229 --> 00:41:06,371
 So, please give me a reason. 

585
00:41:06,371 --> 00:41:09,751
 The justification to keep the current webtoon team. 

586
00:41:09,751 --> 00:41:12,411
The justification.

587
00:41:12,411 --> 00:41:16,111
What are you doing here alone?

588
00:41:16,111 --> 00:41:17,741
You didn't go home yet?

589
00:41:17,741 --> 00:41:21,741
I went to an offsite meeting and stopped by before going home.

590
00:41:21,741 --> 00:41:24,281
♫  I'm the only one who forgot to sleep  ♫

♫  My heart which shines like that far away starlight  ♫

592
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:31,991
Why?

593
00:41:31,991 --> 00:41:33,711
Is something wrong?

594
00:41:33,711 --> 00:41:36,800
No, well...

595
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:40,651
I mean, really...

596
00:41:40,651 --> 00:41:44,140
By chance, did you hear something?

597
00:41:46,381 --> 00:41:47,950
What?

598
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:52,900
Well, I did hear something...

599
00:41:54,781 --> 00:41:56,781
You know PD Gu Jun Yeong?

600
00:41:56,781 --> 00:42:00,448
♫  It shines on my fading wish  ♫

602
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:12,600
♫  greeted tired me saying "Great job".  ♫

603

605
00:42:23,031 --> 00:42:27,241
♫  Like the star passing through distant time which reached me  ♫

606
00:42:27,241 --> 00:42:30,010
What's that?

607
00:42:30,010 --> 00:42:31,690
This...

608
00:42:31,690 --> 00:42:33,351
It's called Dreamcatcher.

609
00:42:33,351 --> 00:42:35,551
It prevents nightmares.

610
00:42:36,321 --> 00:42:39,621
While working on your series, I hope you get some good sleep here and there.

611
00:42:39,621 --> 00:42:43,641
It's a gift I prepared for you.

612
00:42:43,641 --> 00:42:45,461
Now that you've moved,

613
00:42:45,461 --> 00:42:50,251
I hope only good things fill up this new place.

614
00:42:50,251 --> 00:42:51,911
Here.

615
00:42:51,911 --> 00:42:53,791
Let's see.

616
00:42:55,661 --> 00:42:57,121
So pretty.

617
00:42:57,121 --> 00:42:58,391
Right?

618
00:42:58,391 --> 00:43:01,171
I put a lot of effort into picking this.

619
00:43:17,731 --> 00:43:19,281
You don't have to answer that?

620
00:43:19,281 --> 00:43:22,574
Oh, I don't usually answer a number I don't recognize.

621
00:43:22,574 --> 00:43:24,404
I see.

622
00:43:32,841 --> 00:43:36,481
 Paju Hospital, Gyeonggi-do Medical Center 

623
00:44:04,511 --> 00:44:06,401
What's up?

624
00:44:15,861 --> 00:44:19,611
I'm sorry about that day.

625
00:44:20,361 --> 00:44:22,951
I wasn't trying to say that.

626
00:44:24,121 --> 00:44:27,161
Is something wrong these days?

627
00:44:27,161 --> 00:44:32,451
I just didn't want you to get hurt.

628
00:44:33,891 --> 00:44:36,851
But I was too mean.

629
00:44:37,671 --> 00:44:39,751
As for me, you know...

630
00:44:43,391 --> 00:44:47,101
My gosh. I guess I don't have to look after myself.

631
00:44:49,181 --> 00:44:51,921
You look after me so well.

632
00:44:54,841 --> 00:44:57,871
Oh, right. I helped Artist Sin Dae Ryuk move today.

633
00:44:57,871 --> 00:44:59,711
I saw our pictures while helping him unpack.

634
00:44:59,711 --> 00:45:02,621
A while ago, we were laughing, crying...

635
00:45:02,621 --> 00:45:06,141
I was dressed in all kinds of outfits to take photos. Do you remember?

636
00:45:06,861 --> 00:45:09,921
We had so much fun then. Didn't we?

637
00:45:09,921 --> 00:45:11,801
It was fun...

638
00:45:13,801 --> 00:45:15,961
 because I was with you. 

639
00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:45,760
 Letter of Resignation 

640
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:52,600
 Letter of Resignation: Gu Jun Yeong 

641
00:46:04,307 --> 00:46:06,450
Gu Jun Yeong didn't come in today?

642
00:46:06,450 --> 00:46:08,233
He requested vacation. Why?

643
00:46:08,233 --> 00:46:09,983
Vacation?

644
00:46:26,130 --> 00:46:29,020
 The number you have called ... 

645
00:46:29,020 --> 00:46:31,484
What is going on?

646
00:46:31,484 --> 00:46:34,340
Anyone know where Gu Jun Yeong might go to?

647
00:46:57,490 --> 00:47:00,190
 Editor Jang Man Cheol 

648
00:47:08,430 --> 00:47:13,720
 Unread text messages: "Are you free tonight?" 

649
00:47:14,405 --> 00:47:18,795
 I just didn't want you to get hurt. 

650
00:47:19,555 --> 00:47:22,555
 But I was too mean. 

651
00:47:25,285 --> 00:47:27,295
Something's off, right?

652
00:47:27,295 --> 00:47:29,735
It seems like something serious is going on.

653
00:47:29,735 --> 00:47:32,415
I don't think it's simply a vacation.

654
00:47:32,415 --> 00:47:35,125
PD On. Did you hear anything?

655
00:47:35,125 --> 00:47:37,915
Moving to another company or something?

656
00:47:37,915 --> 00:47:40,825
No. I don't think that's it.

657
00:47:40,825 --> 00:47:45,915
Didn't it seem as if PD Jun Yeong seemed to have a lot on his mind?

658
00:47:45,915 --> 00:47:49,805
He was a bit cold, after the company dinner.

659
00:47:58,355 --> 00:47:59,715
He's not there, either?

660
00:47:59,715 --> 00:48:01,735
No.

661
00:48:01,735 --> 00:48:05,515
I'm on my way to Ae Ri's memorial park.

662
00:48:05,515 --> 00:48:09,105
I guess he could've gone to visit his sister.

663
00:48:09,105 --> 00:48:12,335
In any case, the resignation letter processing—

664
00:48:14,955 --> 00:48:17,445
I'll call you back.

665
00:48:17,445 --> 00:48:20,155
Did PD Jun Yeong resign?

666
00:48:23,465 --> 00:48:27,385
This is Jun Yeong's older sister?

667
00:48:29,565 --> 00:48:32,075
Ae Ri...

668
00:48:32,075 --> 00:48:38,925
let us know most effectively why we should produce webtoons.

669
00:49:04,315 --> 00:49:07,935
 R.I.P. Gu Ae Ri, Maria 

670
00:49:07,935 --> 00:49:10,105
Hi.

671
00:49:10,105 --> 00:49:13,285
And Hyeong Man Cheol always said that

672
00:49:13,285 --> 00:49:16,855
whenever he saw Ae Ri who looked so happy reading webtoons,
  R.I.P. Gu Ae Ri, Maria 

673
00:49:16,855 --> 00:49:19,255
he realizes why he started this work.

674
00:49:19,255 --> 00:49:23,665
He had said he clearly remembers the reason.

675
00:49:23,665 --> 00:49:25,685
 Okay! 

676
00:49:25,685 --> 00:49:28,455
 The last upload posted without any issues. 

677
00:49:28,455 --> 00:49:30,145
 Thank you for meeting your deadlines once again! 

678
00:49:30,145 --> 00:49:32,695
 Good work! 

679
00:49:32,695 --> 00:49:34,635
  It's the best webtoon! 

680
00:49:34,635 --> 00:49:37,175
 My soul is healed, thanks to you. 

681
00:49:39,125 --> 00:49:42,635
 Let's go home and sleep soundly— 

682
00:49:42,635 --> 00:49:44,305
 My goodness... 

683
00:49:44,305 --> 00:49:47,735
 You're the first commentor once again, Ae RI. 

684
00:49:48,645 --> 00:49:49,675
 Do you like it that much? 

685
00:49:49,675 --> 00:49:51,115
 It's really fun. 

686
00:49:51,115 --> 00:49:53,565
 This time it's the best once again. 

687
00:49:57,805 --> 00:50:03,315
But at that time, we had to let Ae Ri go first.

688
00:50:07,695 --> 00:50:12,695
 Under the circumstances, it'll be difficult to... 

689
00:50:16,485 --> 00:50:18,655
 extend your contract. 

690
00:50:18,655 --> 00:50:20,765
 It's okay. 

691
00:50:24,225 --> 00:50:25,645
 I'm sorry. 

692
00:50:25,645 --> 00:50:27,385
 I'm aware of your situation. 

693
00:50:27,385 --> 00:50:30,965
 I'm so powerless. I'm ashamed. 

694
00:50:32,465 --> 00:50:35,375
 I'll continue to watch your work. 

695
00:50:36,605 --> 00:50:39,005
 I'm not leaving as a reader. 

696
00:50:39,005 --> 00:50:42,785
 Please make lots of great webtoons going forward. 

697
00:50:47,065 --> 00:50:51,135
 Once things improve, I'll bring you back. 

698
00:50:51,135 --> 00:50:54,385
 I'll have to work harder, so that happens as well. 

699
00:50:54,385 --> 00:50:55,455
 Yes. 

700
00:50:55,455 --> 00:50:56,695
 Don't worry. 

701
00:50:56,695 --> 00:50:58,935
 It's not like we're parting ways forever. 

702
00:50:58,935 --> 00:51:01,585
 I'll be fine. 

703
00:51:03,095 --> 00:51:05,015
 Thanks. 

704
00:51:06,555 --> 00:51:08,525
 Why didn't you tell her? 

705
00:51:08,525 --> 00:51:10,655
 That GingerToon is shutting down. 

706
00:51:10,655 --> 00:51:13,095
 How can I tell her that? 

707
00:51:13,095 --> 00:51:17,005
 To someone who is smiling as she says she'll remain a reader. 

708
00:51:19,005 --> 00:51:20,955
 Hyeong, here... 

709
00:51:23,795 --> 00:51:25,625
 Ji Hyeong. 

710
00:51:28,045 --> 00:51:31,465
 I'll be sure to find a company that'll take all of you guys together. 

711
00:51:31,465 --> 00:51:32,795
So...

712
00:51:32,795 --> 00:51:37,665
 So I'll protect you guys as well as the webtoons we created together. 

713
00:51:37,665 --> 00:51:43,305
 If I ask Ae Ri to come back to us then, she'd come back, right? 

714
00:51:46,765 --> 00:51:49,035
 Ae Ri, this one, too. 

715
00:52:12,915 --> 00:52:15,875
 Thanks to you, I feel stronger. 

716
00:52:18,025 --> 00:52:20,145
Despite that, Ae Ri...

717
00:52:20,145 --> 00:52:26,435
kept her promise that she'd remain a reader even after leaving the job.

718
00:52:26,435 --> 00:52:29,345
So it was our turn...

719
00:52:29,345 --> 00:52:36,955
to keep the promise that we'll provide a setting to work together again.

720
00:52:36,955 --> 00:52:37,955
I'm sorry.

721
00:52:37,955 --> 00:52:40,335
We're not just asking for your help.

722
00:52:40,335 --> 00:52:42,535
Sir!

723
00:52:42,535 --> 00:52:45,395
I'm saying we'll be help to you!

724
00:52:46,425 --> 00:52:47,485
Hyeong, let's go.

725
00:52:47,485 --> 00:52:48,875
I'm sorry.

726
00:52:48,875 --> 00:52:52,055
I'm not asking you to take over right away...

727
00:52:52,055 --> 00:52:55,605
Wh-Why not r-review the paperwork...

728
00:53:03,485 --> 00:53:06,375
Shall we try again?

729
00:53:06,375 --> 00:53:08,475
Of course, we should try again.

730
00:53:10,955 --> 00:53:12,795
Let's go!

731
00:53:19,335 --> 00:53:21,385
Okay, coming...

732
00:53:23,505 --> 00:53:24,995
Just a moment...

733
00:53:24,995 --> 00:53:26,825
Please give us five minutes.

734
00:53:26,825 --> 00:53:28,875
- Please?
 - It's not that easy an issue.

735
00:53:28,875 --> 00:53:31,065
- No, no...
- Just listen to us and...

736
00:53:31,065 --> 00:53:32,555
Director! Director!

737
00:53:32,555 --> 00:53:34,225
Please give us a few moments!

738
00:53:34,225 --> 00:53:37,755
I have a plan that will be helpful to Neon!

739
00:53:37,755 --> 00:53:41,395
We're not interested in merger and acquisition.

740
00:53:42,475 --> 00:53:45,945
If Neon opens up a Webtoon division, it'll be a great help to the company as well.

741
00:53:45,945 --> 00:53:49,355
Please give me five minutes! I'll explain everything!

742
00:53:51,845 --> 00:53:54,485
Gosh, why did you do that?

743
00:53:54,485 --> 00:53:56,715
Why did you kneel?

744
00:53:56,715 --> 00:53:59,365
Did we do something wrong?

745
00:54:00,425 --> 00:54:04,195
I told you I'd take care of everyone on our team.

746
00:54:04,195 --> 00:54:09,095
The company has to be at least Neon size for our team to stay put and be stable.

747
00:54:09,095 --> 00:54:09,915
Seriously.

748
00:54:09,915 --> 00:54:12,595
Hungry people are usually more desperate.

749
00:54:12,595 --> 00:54:14,155
- But still...
 - Hungry for food—

750
00:54:14,155 --> 00:54:15,955
Excuse me.

751
00:54:21,065 --> 00:54:25,325
I'm Neon's CEO Yun Tae Hui.

752
00:54:26,945 --> 00:54:30,335
I'd like to speak with you.

753
00:54:38,727 --> 00:54:42,127
So, taking in your entire team is the condition?

754
00:54:42,955 --> 00:54:44,895
Are there six members?

755
00:54:46,095 --> 00:54:48,345
There's one more.

756
00:55:29,095 --> 00:55:30,455
I'm so glad!

757
00:55:30,455 --> 00:55:33,345
Finally, I can face my team members.

758
00:55:33,345 --> 00:55:36,845
But what kind of terms are they asking for?

759
00:55:36,845 --> 00:55:40,555
All of us moving together isn't an easy task.

760
00:55:40,555 --> 00:55:43,108
Gosh, it's nothing much. Don't you worry.

761
00:55:43,108 --> 00:55:47,278
Here. For our future in Neon!

762
00:55:50,325 --> 00:55:52,395
For our future!

763
00:55:57,365 --> 00:55:59,585
Gosh, I barely survived. Yeah, right.

764
00:55:59,585 --> 00:56:01,365
I should call Ae Ri asap.

765
00:56:01,365 --> 00:56:03,835
She hasn't been posting comments in a while.

766
00:56:03,835 --> 00:56:06,325
I'll kneel and beg for forgiveness.

767
00:56:06,325 --> 00:56:08,115
 PD Gi Yu Mi 

768
00:56:08,115 --> 00:56:11,025
Wow, I can't believe Yu Mi is calling, too.

769
00:56:11,025 --> 00:56:13,205
PD Yu Mi!

770
00:56:13,205 --> 00:56:15,585
 Editor, what do we do? 

771
00:56:15,585 --> 00:56:17,088
What's wrong?

772
00:56:17,088 --> 00:56:19,138
Did something happen?

773
00:56:30,158 --> 00:56:32,350
 R.I.P. Gu Ae Ri, Maria 

774
00:57:01,138 --> 00:57:03,338
Then that's when...

775
00:57:06,091 --> 00:57:08,538
Uploading webtoons each day...

776
00:57:08,538 --> 00:57:13,028
It could just be merely webtoons for some.

777
00:57:13,028 --> 00:57:19,481
But ever since that day, the weight of it all

778
00:57:21,808 --> 00:57:24,158
has become much heavier.

779
00:57:24,158 --> 00:57:26,598
As heavy as one person.

780
00:57:29,968 --> 00:57:33,678
So, if we let go of Jun Yeong without clearing things up,

781
00:57:33,678 --> 00:57:36,038
it will be too painful.

782
00:57:37,298 --> 00:57:42,878
For Jun Yeong and for us as well.

783
00:57:50,038 --> 00:57:51,548
Yes...

784
00:58:26,378 --> 00:58:28,958
You said you wouldn't run away.

785
00:58:33,858 --> 00:58:35,748
Jun Yeong.

786
00:58:37,368 --> 00:58:39,778
Come back to your spot.

787
00:58:40,458 --> 00:58:42,638
You leaving like this...

788
00:58:42,638 --> 00:58:45,308
Your sister wouldn't want that for you, either.

789
00:58:45,308 --> 00:58:47,758
That's not my spot.

790
00:58:52,930 --> 00:58:54,320
All right.

791
00:58:54,320 --> 00:58:59,488
If you insist, then come back to the office one last time.

792
00:59:00,548 --> 00:59:03,768
Your sister's things are still at the office.

793
00:59:03,768 --> 00:59:07,898
We found them after we moved out of the GingerToon office.

794
00:59:07,898 --> 00:59:10,488
I'll leave it on your desk, so take a look.

795
00:59:10,488 --> 00:59:13,148
And if you still don't have a change of heart afterward,

796
00:59:14,958 --> 00:59:17,838
then I'll seriously consider your resignation.

797
00:59:52,324 --> 00:59:54,050
 Doesn't it make you angry? 

798
00:59:54,050 --> 00:59:56,370
 Why do you smile there like a fool? 

799
00:59:56,370 --> 00:59:58,600
 It's true that I was a former athlete. 

800
00:59:58,600 --> 00:59:59,873
 And it's true that I'm a contractor. 

801
00:59:59,873 --> 01:00:04,453
 Ma Eum, you look like someone I know. 

802
01:00:04,453 --> 01:00:05,850
 Who? 

803
01:00:05,850 --> 01:00:08,310
 Fighting! Fighting! 

804
01:00:08,310 --> 01:00:09,230
 Fighting! 

805
01:00:09,230 --> 01:00:10,910
 Stay strong! Fighting! 

806
01:00:10,910 --> 01:00:11,740
 Fighting! 

807
01:00:11,740 --> 01:00:14,130
 - Let's go!
 - Fighting! 

808
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:19,330
There is someone.

809
01:01:11,120 --> 01:01:15,390
 Gu Ae Ri's notebook 

810
01:01:27,260 --> 01:01:29,850
♫  How is your day?  ♫

811
01:01:29,850 --> 01:01:32,590
♫  How is your heart?  ♫

812
01:01:32,590 --> 01:01:37,870
♫  Even though the day was intense, the night shines.  ♫

813
01:01:37,870 --> 01:01:40,460
♫  Everyday is my birthday  ♫

814
01:01:40,460 --> 01:01:43,140
♫  I'm like a awkward child  ♫

815
01:01:43,140 --> 01:01:47,180
♫  Everything feels new as though I am reborn. ♫

816
01:01:47,180 --> 01:01:49,500
♫  The little whisper of the wind  ♫

01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:52,750
 You Always Let Me Know That I'm Also a Flower  
 ♫ and the warmth of the blazing sun ♫

818
01:01:52,750 --> 01:01:59,100
♫  greeted tired me saying "great job".  ♫

819
01:01:59,100 --> 01:02:01,860
♫  In the dark night when everyone is asleep,  ♫

820
01:02:01,860 --> 01:02:04,520
♫  I'm the only one who forgot to sleep  ♫

821

♫  My heart which shines like that far away starlight  ♫

822
01:02:09,880 --> 01:02:16,240

825
01:02:23,180 --> 01:02:25,870
♫  How is your heart?  ♫

826
01:02:25,870 --> 01:02:29,560
♫  Even though the day was intense, the night shines.  ♫

827
01:02:29,560 --> 01:02:32,830
 "Whether it's the 100th time, 101st time, or 10,000th time, 

828
01:02:32,830 --> 01:02:36,570
 it's still a success when you 'finally' do succeed." 

829
01:02:36,570 --> 01:02:40,530
♫  It shines on my fading wish  ♫

830

♫  A night dreaming dreams  ♫

834
01:02:54,610 --> 01:02:56,000
 "We're friends 

835
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:59,500
 because I'm confident I can genuinely smile for you when good things happen for you." 

836
01:02:59,500 --> 01:03:03,200
♫  My heart which shines like that far away starlight  ♫

837

♫  How is your day?  ♫

840
01:03:19,140 --> 01:03:23,310
 "I did a handstand when I felt like I was falling 

841
01:03:23,310 --> 01:03:26,000
 so that I couldn't fall." 

842

 "Youth is like a white sheet of paper. 

844

 Your life changes depending on what kind of drawing you draw." 

845
01:03:49,020 --> 01:03:54,000
 "You always let me know that I'm also a flower." 

846
01:04:05,050 --> 01:04:07,550
 Uncle, tell me now. 

847
01:04:07,550 --> 01:04:11,570
But still, to be the head of the household, she held multiple part-time jobs.

848
01:04:11,570 --> 01:04:16,170
She got run over by a car while coming home early in the morning.

849
01:04:16,170 --> 01:04:20,980
If it weren't for that, Ae Ri wouldn't have died in vain like that.

850
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:26,790
I mean, perhaps if you hadn't gone to study abroad...

851
01:04:26,790 --> 01:04:30,620
 A person's life is so incomprehensible. 

852
01:04:31,470 --> 01:04:36,180
 In the end, the truth always hurts the most. 

853
01:04:37,560 --> 01:04:40,640
 I wanted to believe that it wasn't my fault. 

854
01:04:42,040 --> 01:04:48,470
 Because I knew too well that it was my fault. 

855
01:04:59,070 --> 01:05:00,970
Jun Yeong.

856
01:05:14,360 --> 01:05:16,430
This spot...

857
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:20,860
should've been my sister's spot...

858
01:05:22,754 --> 01:05:25,560
I did that to my sister...

859
01:05:25,560 --> 01:05:28,380
Because of me...

860
01:05:41,740 --> 01:05:43,590
No.

861
01:05:49,900 --> 01:05:51,433
No...

862
01:05:51,433 --> 01:05:53,593
It's not your fault.

863
01:05:54,820 --> 01:05:56,810
It's okay.

864
01:06:12,438 --> 01:06:14,458
It's okay...

865
01:06:36,390 --> 01:06:46,380


866
01:06:51,310 --> 01:06:57,140
♫  Today is calm in the middle, surrounded by empty bottles  ♫

867
01:06:57,140 --> 01:07:00,940
♫  Singing songs about our own  ♫

868
01:07:02,730 --> 01:07:05,600
♫  I'll take your hands and won't let go  ♫

869
01:07:05,600 --> 01:07:10,680
♫  No need to say the word, cause you know, we know, we know, I know, I know  ♫

 Today's Webtoon 

871
01:07:13,430 --> 01:07:17,740
 There are only three months left for us. 

872
01:07:17,740 --> 01:07:20,930
 It's finals from now on. 

873
01:07:20,930 --> 01:07:23,890
 I wonder what kind of offer Neon could make. 

874
01:07:23,890 --> 01:07:29,170
 Under the circumstances, do you know who could protect themself? 

875
01:07:29,170 --> 01:07:31,190
 Ma Eum... 

876
01:07:32,240 --> 01:07:35,170
 Okay. I'll give you one last chance. 

877
01:07:35,170 --> 01:07:36,390
 The cost of the takeover is... 

878
01:07:36,390 --> 01:07:38,320
 Why... 

879
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:39,710
 Why did an article like this... 

880
01:07:39,710 --> 01:07:41,530
