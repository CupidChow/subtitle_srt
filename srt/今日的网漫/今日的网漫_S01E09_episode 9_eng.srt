1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:08,030


2
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:34,100
 Today’s Webtoon 

3
00:00:45,467 --> 00:00:50,227
 Episode 9: Don't be defeated, by either loneliness or fate 

4
00:00:50,227 --> 00:00:52,227
 The Star of North Sea 

5
00:01:29,617 --> 00:01:31,097
Two of them for 15,000 won.

6
00:01:31,097 --> 00:01:34,257
I'll come next time. Thank you.

7
00:01:35,877 --> 00:01:37,817
 Sketch 

8
00:01:44,067 --> 00:01:45,807
Hello.

9
00:01:46,577 --> 00:01:48,477
It's so pretty.

10
00:01:56,077 --> 00:01:58,007
This one?

11
00:02:03,107 --> 00:02:05,127
Hey, Oppa!

12
00:02:17,217 --> 00:02:19,597
Hey! What's with you?

13
00:02:19,597 --> 00:02:21,207
- Oppa, don't.
- What are you doing?

14
00:02:21,207 --> 00:02:23,367
- People are watching. 
- What are you drawing? Give it.

15
00:02:23,367 --> 00:02:25,147
Give it to me!

16
00:02:25,147 --> 00:02:27,157
Give it. Give it, man!

17
00:02:27,157 --> 00:02:28,647
Oppa, seriously!

18
00:02:28,647 --> 00:02:30,817
- Come. Come here. Give it! 
- Stop it, please!

19
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:32,707
Give it to me!

20
00:02:34,457 --> 00:02:36,367
You crazy a**hole!

21
00:02:37,897 --> 00:02:39,717
Oppa, stop it!

22
00:02:39,717 --> 00:02:42,367
- Hey! 
- Stop! Please don't record this.

23
00:02:42,367 --> 00:02:44,197
- Don't record us. 
- Come here!

24
00:02:44,197 --> 00:02:46,410
Get over here!

25
00:02:53,457 --> 00:02:55,257
Artist Sin.

26
00:03:00,312 --> 00:03:03,712
It turns out Sin Dae Ryuk is the one who got beat up.

27
00:03:03,712 --> 00:03:07,625
This a**hole was about to touch my girlfriend!

28
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:10,737
Is that true?

29
00:03:10,737 --> 00:03:12,447
- What do you mean, no?
- Come on!

30
00:03:12,447 --> 00:03:14,617
It really wasn't like that!

31
00:03:14,617 --> 00:03:19,167
But... he did follow me around and creeped me out.

32
00:03:19,167 --> 00:03:22,047
He kept staring with creepy eyes.

33
00:03:23,647 --> 00:03:25,617
 Sketch 

34
00:03:25,617 --> 00:03:30,887
I was d-drawing...

35
00:03:36,677 --> 00:03:38,827
Let me introduce myself formally.

36
00:03:38,827 --> 00:03:42,137
I'm CEO Kim Yeong Shin of YoungToon.

37
00:03:42,137 --> 00:03:43,837
Oh, yes.

38
00:03:47,897 --> 00:03:51,477
I caught you off guard by coming to see you without notice, right?

39
00:03:51,477 --> 00:03:54,007
Yes, it was a bit of a shock.

40
00:03:54,007 --> 00:03:59,457
It's extremely rare for the CEO to personally pay a visit.

41
00:03:59,457 --> 00:04:02,137
Had I asked you in advance through someone else,

42
00:04:02,137 --> 00:04:04,857
I was afraid you'd turn me down right away.

43
00:04:07,287 --> 00:04:10,477
We want to have you at our company, Deputy Editor.

44
00:04:10,477 --> 00:04:15,067
I want to recruit you as Editor-in-Chief of Young Toon.

45
00:04:27,737 --> 00:04:30,887
Artist Sin, why did you do that exactly?

46
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:37,817
Artist Sin, do you know what today is?

47
00:04:39,627 --> 00:04:43,437
The publication of the Peeve Weapon series was confirmed today.

48
00:04:43,437 --> 00:04:46,397
It's the happiest and most meaningful day of my life as a PD.

49
00:04:46,397 --> 00:04:50,517
It's the day your dream came true. But...

50
00:04:50,517 --> 00:04:54,987
I couldn't figure out the female character's emotions that I was supposed to revise.

51
00:04:56,887 --> 00:05:00,147
So I drew someone similar to the character.

52
00:05:00,147 --> 00:05:04,577
Are you ultimately saying that you bothered other people because of your cartoon?

53
00:05:06,627 --> 00:05:08,597
Artist Sin!

54
00:05:09,275 --> 00:05:12,175
Yes, your cartoon is important.

55
00:05:12,175 --> 00:05:16,127
But it's not as valuable as people. I...

56
00:05:16,127 --> 00:05:19,767
I think you forget that all the time.

57
00:05:21,867 --> 00:05:25,407
I'm sorry. I'll have to get going first tonight.

58
00:05:26,467 --> 00:05:28,747
Don't abandon me!

59
00:05:30,837 --> 00:05:32,597
PD, you're...

60
00:05:33,637 --> 00:05:37,617
a god... to me.

61
00:05:37,617 --> 00:05:43,490
 Now, I see why Artist Sin said you're like a god to him. 

62
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:46,350
People don't like me.

63
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:49,160
They didn't like my cartoon, either.

64
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:55,616
But... you're the only one who said I'm fine just the way I am.

65
00:05:56,510 --> 00:06:00,230
Saying that I'm also worthwhile.

66
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:02,340
You believed in me.

67
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:06,210
- Artist Sin, I just— 
- I'll never do anything you tell me not to do.

68
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:09,813
I won't do things you dislike, so...

69
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,110
please don't abandon me.

70
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:22,823
I'm sorry.

71
00:06:39,307 --> 00:06:41,437
What are you thinking about?

72
00:06:41,437 --> 00:06:43,280
Jun Yeong.

73
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,230
Run first.

74
00:06:52,411 --> 00:06:55,251
Is it about what happened yesterday? You don't look good.

75
00:06:57,349 --> 00:07:01,069
Jun Yeong, can I ask you a favor?

76
00:07:01,069 --> 00:07:03,210
What kind of favor?

77
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:05,360
About the incident with Sin Dae Ryuk.

78
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,040
Can you keep it a secret from work?

79
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:12,300
You'd be in a tough spot if it's found out later.

80
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:15,600
I'm afraid the publication of his series might get canceled.

81
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:19,260
I'll be sure it has no negative effects on you, Jun Yeong.

82
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:22,760
- All right. 
- Thank you.

83
00:07:32,184 --> 00:07:34,284
My apologies.

84
00:07:34,284 --> 00:07:36,245
I had to work late last night

85
00:07:36,245 --> 00:07:38,348
so I couldn't answer your call.

86
00:07:38,348 --> 00:07:42,960
Jun Yeong, you seem to work hard at everything.

87
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:50,310
It seems you took a great part in maintaining the presence on the homepage.

88
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:53,770
So, what happened with Artist Na Gang Nam?

89
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:59,610
For now, he decided to work simultsneously with Young Toon on a short project.

90
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:04,250
So he'll continue his series on Neon, right?

91
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,840
Was this also your achievement?

92
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:09,860
- That's— 
- I believe action over words.

93
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:14,530
But your current stance on things seems to have changed a little bit.

94
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:19,530
Just let me know at any time if you've changed your mind.

95
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:25,340
I thought you were too good to waste, so I just wanted to give you an opportunity.

96
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,270
Everyone, listen up.

97
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:31,430
Daebak incident! Daebak!

98
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:33,570
People don't say "Daebak" that much these days.

99
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:36,360
If so, super-daebak incident!

100
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:39,340
So, what incidnt are you referring to?

101
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:42,110
I located Artist Ma Hae Gyu.

102
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:43,620
- What?
 - Daebak!

103
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:45,170
Artist Ma Hae Gyu.

104
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:46,970
"Please! Time Machine." That Artist Ma Hae Gyu?

105
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:48,750
Yup!

106
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:50,320
He's been in seclusion for a long time.

107
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,280
As expected, you have quite a network and connections, Editor.

108
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:56,320
I worked through all my connections from when I used to print comic books.

109
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,480
Since "Please! Time Machine" is so hot right now,

110
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,560
wouldn't it be great to do a webtoon remake?

111
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,490
Convincing him won't be easy, though.

112
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:04,120
Right. It won't be easy.

113
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,690
So I'll step forward.

114
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:07,270
You'll personally do the convincing?

115
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:09,720
Since I used to be the PD in charge and worked with him,

116
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:12,170
I was thinking, On Ma Eum and Gu Jun Yeong.

117
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:13,390
- Yes?
 - Yes.

118
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:15,840
What a hassle. PD On-Gu from now on.

119
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,480
You two, go with me.

120
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:21,520
It'll be good to discuss the proposal you two worked on with him.

121
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:24,540
- Okay, sounds good. 
- Yes.

122
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,950
Fighting! Yeah!

123
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:30,210
Fighting!

124
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:33,120
Amazing Jang Man Cheol.

125
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:39,410
I met Artist Ma Hae Gyu for the first time when I was a rookie like you guys.

126
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:42,800
He used to be a big-name master back then.

127
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,160
How about now?

128
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,500
He's been out of the limelight.

129
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,580
He stopped drawing a while ago.

130
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:50,680
I don't even know if he'll remember me.

131
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:54,690
But I'm not as nervous since I'm going with you guys.

132
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,170
You've arranged this meeting in advance with Artist Ma Hae Gyu, right?

133
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:01,960
His daughter answered the phone.

134
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:05,070
She said to come and talk to him in person if I wanted to.

135
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:07,290
My goodness.

136
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:37,930
I thought he'd be extremely well off, considering his royalties.

137
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:41,490
He was. He just lost it all.

138
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:43,690
Through stocks and gambling.

139
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,660
Artist Ma!

140
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:52,910
Artist Ma Hae Gyu!

141
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:56,080
His daughter said that he's always home.

142
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,150
Artist Ma Hae Gyu!

143
00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:00,440
Who are you?

144
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,190
Oh, you must be Yu Na.

145
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:04,840
I'm the one you spoke to over the phone. Ahjeossi Jang Man Cheol.

146
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,910
Editor-in-Chief at Neon.

147
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:09,200
Is your father inside?

148
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:11,940
Please come in.

149
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,980
Excuse us.

150
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,610
I have to get to my part-time job. So please wrap up in 30 minutes.

151
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:33,490
Your mom must not be home?

152
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:35,950
Your mom likes watermelons. So I bought one.

153
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:38,420
If you tell her I came by, your mom will be so glad to see me.

154
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:40,420
Your mom used to feed me a lot, too.

155
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:42,860
Her kimchi stew is super good.

156
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:48,840
Well, so... when is your mom coming home?

157
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,860
She passed away.

158
00:11:57,630 --> 00:12:00,240
His room is over that way.

159
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:05,690
Let's go.

160
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:15,900
Sir? May I come in?

161
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:34,390
Sir...

162
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:36,800
How have you been?

163
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,320
I used to work for the comic magazine "Flow."

164
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,580
I'm Jang Man Cheol.

165
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:47,190
Jang Man Cheol?

166
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:51,500
When I used to live in Apgujeong, you used to come by to pick up my manuscript, right?

167
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,720
Yes, sir!

168
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,441
Yes, sir.  Yes, you remember me.

169
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:59,700
- Sit down. 
 - Yes.

170
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:16,910
Do you still like baseball?

171
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:19,570
Was it Monsters?

172
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:21,430
You still haven't switched out of that last-place team?

173
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:25,390
I'd rather quit baseball than switch teams.

174
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:28,200
That's a great line!

175
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:31,090
I'll have to use it next time.

176
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:38,330
So, what brings you here today?

177
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:42,330
Yes, one of your works, "Please, Time Machine."

178
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:45,190
I thought it'd be good if we remake that into a webtoon.

179
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:48,690
- So I came to discuss that with you. 
- I won't do it!

180
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:54,150
You must read comics on paper.

181
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:58,960
You shouldn't be reading it on a tiny phone screen.

182
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:02,570
Yes, but the scenes in your cartoon are so wonderfully drawn.

183
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:06,530
If we change that up to fit the current webtoon scroll format,

184
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:08,350
I think it will become very popular.

185
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:11,800
It would be a great opportunity to introduce your works to today's youth.

186
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:15,730
I'll think about it if you bring me one billion won.

187
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:30,430
My heart and soul are in that comic.

188
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:35,330
M-Maybe not one billion won, but we'll do our best to give you a great offer.

189
00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:38,850
Of course, you'll own the copyright, royalties, and all that.

190
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:41,030
We'll offer you as much as possible at the signing of the contract

191
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:44,870
to improve your finances and the state of your studio—

192
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:11,160
That moron still thinks he's a successful cartoonist.

193
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:15,100
- Your father truly is the best.
 - So what?

194
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:17,870
He was erased from the world a long time ago.

195
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:22,560
To help him revive his career, my mom struggled all her life to support him and died.

196
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,270
I just feel sorry for my mom.

197
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:27,380
Human trash.

198
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:41,910
We'll be back.

199
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:43,770
You're wasting your time.

200
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:46,620
It'd be the same even if you come back.

201
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:52,900
If anything comes up and you need my help, call me.

202
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:59,300
You can call me if you crave yummy food or are bored.

203
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:05,430
 Neon, On Ma Eum 

204
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:07,220
Ma Yu Na, fighting!

205
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:10,140
- See you again.
 - Call me.

206
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:23,410
 Neon, On Ma Eum 

207
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:27,760
You two should watch and learn.

208
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,540
Going forward as PDs,

209
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:33,260
I brought you with me, so you could understand the artists you'll get to work with.

210
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:35,670
- Especially you, PD On Ma Eum. 
 - Yes.

211
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:40,230
You'll have to pay more attention to Artist Sin Dae Ryuk.

212
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:46,210
The lives of artists who only know how to be cartoonists usually turn out in a similar fashion.

213
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:50,930
They may leave brilliant works behind, but most of them lose balance in life.

214
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:55,880
So that genius doesn't light only one fire and get extinguished,

215
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:58,770
helping them so that they can shine brighter and brighter for a long time

216
00:16:58,770 --> 00:17:01,390
is our job as PDs.

217
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:04,300
Yes, I'll keep that in mind.

218
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,570
 Cheongma Study Dorm 

219
00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:23,180
 PD On Ma Eum 

220
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,510
Artist Sin, it's PD On Ma Eum.

221
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:29,660
Are you in?

222
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:35,240
 No smoking 

223
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:43,560
Artist Sin...

224
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,540
PD On.

225
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:50,030
May I come in for a minute?

226
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:52,680
Well...

227
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:58,380
Y-Yes...

228
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:18,160
You do sleep as you work, right?

229
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,800
♫   How is your day?  ♫

230
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:23,070
How about food? Did you eat?

231
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:24,890
Yeah, well...

232
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:27,820
I eat that.  Boxed lunch.

233
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,900
♫   Everyday is my birthday.  ♫

234
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,190
This won't do.

235
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:34,350
Let's go eat together.

236
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:35,890
- What?
 - Hurry up.

237
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:39,510
Get ready and come out.

238
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:40,940
Okay. 
 ♫  ♫

239
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:43,700
♫   the warmth of the blazing sun   ♫

240
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:46,320
♫  greeted tired me with a "great job".   ♫

241
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:50,730
Artist Sin, I told you this last time.

242
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:52,690
Your cartoon is very important,

243
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:55,720
but it's not as valuable as people.

244
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:58,140
Yes.

245
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:02,980
You're also included in that "people."

246
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:07,150
Be sure to eat nutritious meals and you must sleep well. All right?

247
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:09,390
♫  Will I also be able to shine?   ♫

248
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:10,590
Yes.

249
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:13,860
The storyline keeps slipping out of my head.

250
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:16,650
♫  How is your day?  ♫

251
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:19,460
Food.

252
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:21,580
 Eat well... 

253
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:23,960
- Sleep...
 - Sleep well.

254
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:27,350
Good.

255
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:29,750
The meat is burning. Eat up.

256
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:32,100
Thank you for this food.

257
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:07,240
 10:59 p.m., 9/11/2022, Sunday 

258
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:10,330
 Neon: "Full Count" is posted 

259
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:12,420
 1 year ago 

260
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:14,990
 Starting today we have a new player with us. 

261
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:17,340
 She's not an old lady. 

262
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,280
Gather around!

263
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,160
The coach is here. Everyone, gather around!

264
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,460
He swings the bat and is so dynamic!

265
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:34,530
- Oh, my!
 - This is Wu Jin!

266
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:37,670
 Full Count, By Lee Wu Jin 

267
00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:48,630
- Hello. 
- Good morning!

268
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:51,640
Gu Jun Yeong. Isn't this too much?

269
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,560
Pardon?

270
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,130
"Full Count" is already in fourth place.

271
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:57,340
The rookie did such a spectacular job!

272
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:59,250
Really?

273
00:21:04,029 --> 00:21:07,049
Congrats. It'll reach the royal level in no time.

274
00:21:07,049 --> 00:21:08,570
Thank you.

275
00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:11,370
PD Kwon, you'd better be nervous.

276
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:14,223
He'll catch up to "The Girl's Rule" in no time.

277
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:17,750
Is that so? You're better than your seniors.

278
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:19,850
Come on. Come at me.

279
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:21,640
"There is one more for me to read."

280
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,200
"I'm curious to find out what will happen next."

281
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,350
All the comments are positive, too.

282
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:27,540
Congratulations! Gosh, I'm so envious of you.

283
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:29,520
"Peeve Weapon" will do well, too.

284
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,490
Thank you.

285
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:41,840
Aren't you going out to lunch?

286
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,730
Hey.

287
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:53,720
Did your meeting with Artist Ma Hae Gyu yesterday, not go well?

288
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:58,020
That man, he's gone way downhill.

289
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:00,330
He's extremely broken.

290
00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:03,210
I had heard it through the grapevine.

291
00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:06,540
But meeting him in person brought me down.

292
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:09,430
Wondering how my idol of youth has come to this.

293
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:13,050
That's why this remake project is more poignant for you.

294
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:16,760
is more poignant for you.

295
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:19,780
Am I being too greedy?

296
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:23,940
Ever since GingerToon days, you wanted to convert that title into a digital format.

297
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:26,130
So, you remember.

298
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:29,780
Am I too stuck in the past?

299
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:32,620
Making you feeling frustrated as you work by my side?

300
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:38,640
No.

301
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:45,200
I believe this proposal is well-intended and also has good profitability.

302
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,250
By utilizing characters we revive through the webtoon,

303
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:50,870
there is a good potential to expand into other opportunities with additional copyrights.

304
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:52,170
Right?

305
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:53,450
Right! You think so, too, right?

306
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:54,580
Hey, that's it, then!

307
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:56,800
Now that you say it like that, I feel so much more assured!

308
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:59,220
Great! Let's go eat!

309
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,530
Hey, what are you doing?

310
00:23:04,530 --> 00:23:07,010
What I don't understand about Artist Ma Hae Gyu is that

311
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:11,450
this is a great opportunity to easily make some money at the latter stage of his life.

312
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:13,290
Why did he turn it down?

313
00:23:13,290 --> 00:23:16,660
Wouldn't it be about an artist's ego?

314
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:18,960
He could be a perfectionist.

315
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:22,100
Actually, a remake could be a double-edged sword.

316
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:23,830
It's a rebirth, if you put it nicely.

317
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:26,650
Your work is being worked on by other people.

318
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:30,360
He could be concerned about damaging his work.

319
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,700
An artist's ego is important.

320
00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:37,000
Especially a master like Artist Ma Hae Gyu.

321
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:41,980
A genius of an artist usually doesn't get hindered by the ways of the world.

322
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:45,630
I thought you were a realist, PD Kwon.

323
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:49,190
That's because I'm an ordinary salaryman, unlike Artist Ma.

324
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:52,120
If he were apologetic like a guilty one and behaved like me,

325
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:55,540
he would've never created a masterpiece like "Please, Time Machine" in the first place.

326
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:59,330
But still, shouldn't he fulfill his role as the head of a household first?

327
00:23:59,330 --> 00:24:01,440
He still has a family he needs to support.

328
00:24:02,430 --> 00:24:06,170
That's because our PD Gu Jun Yeong is a baby

329
00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:10,710
who has no idea what a masterpiece "Please, Time Machine" is.

330
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:12,250
Just eat.

331
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:13,690
On Ma Eum, what do you think?

332
00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:15,360
You read the entire "Please, Time Machine," right?

333
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,460
Yes, I read it all.

334
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:19,050
What did you think?

335
00:24:19,050 --> 00:24:21,030
Excuse me.

336
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:26,060
Hello?

337
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:28,700
Yes, this is On Ma Eum.

338
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:36,200
I'm sorry. I have to leave.

339
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:38,790
I'll be right there.

340
00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:40,830
Where is this?

341
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:45,590
 It's on that cell phone! 

342
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:46,790
 What a nutjob! 

343
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:48,070
Let go! I'm the victim here.

344
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:49,780
- Let go.
 - Yu Na.

345
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:52,850
Are you Ma Yu Na's guardian?

346
00:24:52,850 --> 00:24:54,820
I'm her eonni. What is this about?

347
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:58,400
This crazy b**** pushed me and destroyed my cell phone!

348
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,240
You secretly took a picture of me from the back!

349
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:03,200
When did I do that? Do you have proof?

350
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,200
There is proof. Show us your phone.

351
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:07,670
You destroyed it, so I can't turn it on.

352
00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:09,260
What proof?

353
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:12,470
Can't you still run the forensics on a broken phone?

354
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:13,620
It's possible.

355
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:14,990
Then, let's do this.

356
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:19,430
I'll compensate you for the phone but please submit your phone as evidence.

357
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:22,940
- What?
 - If you're innocent, I don't think you have anything to lose.

358
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:25,030
Why don't you do that?

359
00:25:26,090 --> 00:25:27,440
- Why should I?
 - Are you okay?

360
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,580
I'm the victim.

361
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:30,270
Let's do that and wrap it up.

362
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:32,700
- Geez.
 - Come on now.

363
00:25:36,770 --> 00:25:39,070
I'm sorry about today.

364
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:43,750
If I say I have no adult to reach out to, they look down on me more and flip out.

365
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:45,920
People like him do.

366
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,210
You did great.

367
00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:50,000
If something like this happens again in the future, call me.

368
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,640
No. So, they can't mess with you, to begin with,

369
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,023
should I teach you self-defense?

370
00:25:56,380 --> 00:26:00,650
As for the money for the phone, I'll repay you with my part-time pay.

371
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:04,250
But do you usually work at this time of the day?

372
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:06,130
Shouldn't you be at school?

373
00:26:06,130 --> 00:26:08,230
The part-timer during the day didn't show up.

374
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:11,710
Well, it's not any fun at school.

375
00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:15,000
It's better to make an extra dollar by going to work.

376
00:26:19,530 --> 00:26:21,650
Give me a bite.

377
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:25,000
- Excuse me?
 - Give me a  bite of the cake.

378
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:35,350
Hey, this is so yummy!

379
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:37,810
Should we order another one?

380
00:26:37,810 --> 00:26:44,140
Mom also used to always say "Ah," asking me for a bite.

381
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:50,410
Your mother was so beautiful.

382
00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:51,980
She was pretty.

383
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:54,830
Her face and heart both.

384
00:26:56,590 --> 00:26:59,930
She just happened to meet a trashy man like my dad

385
00:26:59,930 --> 00:27:04,270
and passed away working all the time, trying to keep that moron alive.

386
00:27:04,270 --> 00:27:06,710
Because of that stupid cartoon.

387
00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:11,730
It's Artist Oh Yun!

388
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:14,190
You're right! Yes, right!

389
00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:17,540
He said hi.

390
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:19,350
Is it because he's drawing a terrible piece?

391
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:20,610
He doesn't look good.

392
00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:22,910
But I'm sure he doesn't have to draw anymore to make a living.

393
00:27:22,910 --> 00:27:24,830
True. Is that why he's not trying too hard?

394
00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:26,740
I guess I'd be the same way.

395
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:28,680
I think his drawings are getting weirder.

396
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:31,000
I know. The story sucks, too.

397
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,760
I don't think he's working.

398
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:35,260
I guess anyone could become a cartoonist.

399
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:41,280
I guess he heard us. Quiet, quiet.

400
00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:47,570
 I dropped hints about terminating the series early to Artist Oh Yun. 

401
00:27:47,570 --> 00:27:49,260
But he was strongly against the idea.

402
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:50,900
He says never.

403
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:54,390
He's afraid that he'd be marked as an early-terminated artist.

404
00:27:54,390 --> 00:27:58,030
Well, that's the expected reaction.

405
00:27:58,030 --> 00:28:04,170
So, I was wondering... could we give him a little more time?

406
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:07,190
Do you think that

407
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:12,130
the editor brought up early termination just because of the sales numbers?

408
00:28:12,130 --> 00:28:16,850
Do you really think that this is helping Artist Oh Yun?

409
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:24,950
Yu Na, have you ever read your father's comics?

410
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:26,420
I haven't.

411
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:29,870
After my mom passed away, I didn't even want to look at them.

412
00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:32,620
So I threw out all of them that were in the house.

413
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:34,500
I don't even read webtoons.

414
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:37,190
I just hate comics altogether.

415
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:38,920
Hate it.

416
00:28:50,010 --> 00:28:52,130
Hey. Coming from somewhere?

417
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:55,320
I met with Artist Ma's daughter.

418
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:56,540
At this time of the day?

419
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:58,810
Well, you know...

420
00:29:00,810 --> 00:29:03,960
She's struggling a lot at her age.

421
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,070
Yes.

422
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:08,150
I could understand why Yu Na would

423
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:10,980
- resent Artist Ma.
 - I guess so.

424
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:14,030
Especially if she has never read Artist Ma's work.

425
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:17,600
But still, I got to see Yu Na smile today.

426
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:20,450
She has such a bright and pretty smile.

427
00:29:20,450 --> 00:29:24,350
I hope she can smile brightly and prettily like that in the future.

428
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:30,570
For that to happen, you must make sure Artist Ma's contract comes through, PD On.

429
00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:31,860
Yes, sir.

430
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:35,880
Artist Sin Dae Ryuk's series starts today, right?

431
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:38,270
- Yes, that's right. 
- You must be nervous.

432
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:39,830
No, I am excited.

433
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:42,790
- You must be nervous. 
- No, I am excited.

434
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:44,100
I'm sure you're nervous.

435
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:44,970
Gosh, no!

436
00:29:44,970 --> 00:29:48,700
I used to be a judo athlete. I don't get nervous over stuff like that.

437
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:56,780
- Gosh.
 - How many minutes to go?

438
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:59,180
Three minutes before 11 o'clock.

439
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:06,840
- Come on now.
 - Let's go!

440
00:30:11,870 --> 00:30:14,110
 Peeve Weapon 

441
00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:23,520
It's up.

442
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,710
Come on, come on.

443
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:35,430
Geez! Seriously!

444
00:30:37,410 --> 00:30:40,840
 Peeve Weapon, By Sin Dae Ryuk 

445
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:44,960
 Peeve Weapon, By Sin Dae Ryuk 

446
00:31:11,430 --> 00:31:15,240
 Aarghf!  Please ... save me! 

447
00:31:24,970 --> 00:31:26,070
 He said it himself. (god***) 

448
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:28,270
  Write an opinion 

449
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,560
What's wrong?

450
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:39,790
What's this?

451
00:31:39,790 --> 00:31:43,710
You kept scrolling too fast. I couldn't read it all.

452
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:46,870
It's not fun?

453
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:50,660
Give it.

454
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,920
Give me the second episode.

455
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:56,960
- Is it fun?
 - Eonni, this is crazy!

456
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,640
It's super fun! So fun!

457
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,660
Eonni, do you have any coins saved up?

458
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:02,140
Mom, I'll subscribe to this and read it.

459
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:03,570
Oh, my gosh! Good job!

460
00:32:03,570 --> 00:32:05,540
You did a great job, my daughter!

461
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:08,060
Hey, let's read it again slowly.

462
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:09,440
From the beginning. Go up to the top.

463
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,890
♫ Life doesn't go the way you want. Things happen which you never expected  ♫

466

♫   When I suddenly lose my footing, grab me.  You know everything  ♫

 I smell it all of a sudden.

 Let's go all the way! 

471
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,150
 Wow, the artist is a genius! 

472
00:32:38,150 --> 00:32:40,430
 It's the ultimate crazy worldview. 

473
00:32:40,430 --> 00:32:42,770
 I was going to skip it because the drawings sucked. 

474
00:32:42,770 --> 00:32:45,420
 But it's so fun! 

475

 ♫   I think you will smile brightly.   ♫  

483
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:23,000
Yes.

484
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,020
Artist Sin, did you see the reactions to "Peeve Weapon"?

485
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:28,550
Everyone says it's very fun.

486
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:30,370
I saw them.

487
00:33:30,370 --> 00:33:31,580
I'm relieved.

488
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:33,340
 You worked so hard. 

489
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:34,880
"Peeve Weapon"...

490
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,460
No.

491
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:42,200
As your number one fan, I'm so proud.

492
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:50,580
Thank you.

493
00:33:53,850 --> 00:34:00,040
Really it's all thanks to your help, PD On.

494
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:05,280
Artist Sin, are you crying?

495
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:16,090
Artist Sin,

496
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:21,860
let us walk along the flowery paths only.

497
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:23,870
Flowery paths...

498
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:27,520
Sounds good.

499
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:33,980
So, stop crying.

500
00:34:46,790 --> 00:34:49,300
It was so much fun today.

501
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:50,940
Gosh, so much fun? What's that?

502
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:52,630
Congratulations.

503
00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:54,820
So pretty... Come on!

504
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:56,630
Should I send it to her?

505
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:59,310
I should send it.

506
00:34:59,310 --> 00:35:01,660
Gosh, seriously.

507
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:18,500
 Good work, PD On. 

508
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:33,290
 #3 "Peeve Weapon"  
Wow!

509
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:37,940
"Peeve Weapon" is daebak!

510
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:40,010
Congratulations, PD On Ma Eum!

511
00:35:40,010 --> 00:35:41,450
Thank you.

512
00:35:41,450 --> 00:35:44,020
It entered the royal level as soon as we published it.

513
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:48,110
The reaction is hot on the SNS sites as well!

514
00:35:49,910 --> 00:35:52,120
The payment rates to watch previews are explosive, too.

515
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:55,360
Often, people watch the first episode and don't pay for the remaining episodes.

516
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,490
I know.

517
00:35:56,490 --> 00:35:58,210
I was worried about his drawing style, but

518
00:35:58,210 --> 00:36:00,720
fortunately, I think they're looking at it as his unique style for now.

519
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:03,180
What if we had missed such a daebak piece of work?

520
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:05,423
Right, PD Kwon?

521
00:36:09,850 --> 00:36:11,660
PD Kwon, stay alert.

522
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:13,100
You've totally out of it.

523
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:15,500
The young ones are pushing their way up.

524
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:17,810
Satisfied? Happy now?

525
00:36:17,810 --> 00:36:20,480
You said it!

526
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,830
You know that this is just the beginning, right?

527
00:36:22,830 --> 00:36:23,900
Yes, sir!

528
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:27,120
If you compare it to a marathon, you just got started.

529
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:28,200
That's right.

530
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:31,850
Winning the first 100m is meaningless.

531
00:36:31,850 --> 00:36:34,610
I'll run hard, so I can finish the race!

532
00:36:34,610 --> 00:36:35,940
- Fighting!
 - Fighting!

533
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:37,850
- Fighting!
 - Congrats, congrats!

534
00:36:37,850 --> 00:36:39,810
Congrats!

535
00:36:39,810 --> 00:36:41,130
Congratulations!

536
00:36:41,130 --> 00:36:44,680
I'm so glad that both "Full Count" and "Peeve Weapon" have good reviews.

537
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:46,350
Let's run the race well to the end.

538
00:36:46,350 --> 00:36:47,850
Okay.

539
00:37:07,410 --> 00:37:08,800
The comments. The comments.

540
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,580
The comments.

541
00:37:16,290 --> 00:37:19,570
 We want to have you at our company, Deputy Editor. 

542
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:24,340
 I want to recruit you as Editor-in-Chief of YoungToon. 

543
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:30,170
What are you doing?

544
00:37:30,170 --> 00:37:32,370
I was looking for something.

545
00:37:32,370 --> 00:37:35,480
You look like you got caught doing something else.

546
00:37:37,870 --> 00:37:39,870
That'd be me.

547
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,540
You're in good mood today.

548
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:47,440
Both "Full Count" and "Peeve Weapon" are doing well!

549
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,510
Also, "The Girl's Rule."

550
00:37:48,510 --> 00:37:52,560
They're always scolding me, saying we spend money on the webtoon camp without any results.

551
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:57,090
I should just throw it back to that Heo Kwan Yeong's face...

552
00:37:57,090 --> 00:38:00,020
Ji Hyeong, you work so hard! Thank you so much!

553
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:01,930
Gosh, don't mention it.

554
00:38:01,930 --> 00:38:03,320
I didn't do much.

555
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:04,950
You didn't do much?

556
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:06,600
You made Artist Na Gang Nam stay.

557
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:08,270
You discovered new artists.

558
00:38:08,270 --> 00:38:10,310
And you assigned them to the new PDs.

559
00:38:10,310 --> 00:38:12,630
Then you took care of them and made sure they did well.

560
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:14,140
Deputy Editor Seok Ji Hyeong!

561
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:16,880
I look forward to continuing to work with you!

562
00:38:20,530 --> 00:38:24,050
I couldn't have done it without you.

563
00:38:24,050 --> 00:38:26,280
Gosh, I'm so relieved.

564
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:28,630
I should've visited you at your studio.

565
00:38:28,630 --> 00:38:32,080
I wanted to come in today to look around Young Toon studio.

566
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:35,580
After looking around, do you get the sense that you'd want to do your next series with us?

567
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:37,960
That'd be nice, but

568
00:38:39,570 --> 00:38:42,080
I'm cautious of what Deputy Editor Seok thinks.

569
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:44,910
What does that matter?

570
00:38:44,910 --> 00:38:49,250
Nothing says Seonbae Ji Hyeong  has to work at Neon forever.

571
00:38:49,250 --> 00:38:50,230
What do you mean by that?

572
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:52,240
You just don't know what'll happen.

573
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:55,500
Just like how you and I got to reunite.

574
00:39:00,650 --> 00:39:03,550
Something... something's up.

575
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:05,520
Honey!

576
00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:11,040
What is all this?

577
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:14,740
I was feeling down so I got a new car.

578
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:20,890
H-Honey, drive s-slowly!

579
00:39:20,890 --> 00:39:23,450
Why would I have bought this if I were going to drive slowly?

580
00:39:23,450 --> 00:39:25,580
- Gosh, feels great!
 - Come on!

581
00:39:25,623 --> 00:39:29,700
Come on! Drive slowly!

582
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:55,250
Gosh, I finished it.

583
00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:15,760
 #2 "Full Count" 

584
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,430
Yes!

585
00:40:20,850 --> 00:40:22,330
 I have one more title to read now. 

586
00:40:22,330 --> 00:40:23,790
 I want to know what happens next. 

587
00:40:23,790 --> 00:40:25,370
 A girls' baseball player story? 

588
00:40:25,370 --> 00:40:26,380
 Thrilling. 

589
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:29,340
 It's so fun! The best! 

590
00:40:32,570 --> 00:40:35,760
 I believe in action over words. 

591
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:40,640
 But your current stance on things seems to have changed a little bit. 

592
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:19,660
 I feel so terrible for you when I see you, Oppa. 

593
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:22,260
 No. I think it's a shame. 

594
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:24,310
 Isn't it about time you leave it all behind you? 

595
00:41:24,310 --> 00:41:25,550
 What are you talking about? 

596
00:41:25,550 --> 00:41:28,540
 GingerToon. The memory of it. 

597
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:31,240
 - Stop it.
 - You stop it, Oppa. 

598
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:33,880
 You should step out of the shadows now of Editor Jang Man Cheol. 

599
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:36,826
 No. Step away from the shadows altogether. 

600
00:41:37,770 --> 00:41:40,780
 So that you can move forward. 

601
00:42:10,290 --> 00:42:12,620
Hi, Yu Na.

602
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:14,690
Coming home now?

603
00:42:14,690 --> 00:42:16,780
You're here again.

604
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:19,880
Artist Ma won't meet me.

605
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:22,620
Let's go in together.

606
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:24,950
It's too late tonight.

607
00:42:24,950 --> 00:42:27,220
Here.

608
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:30,510
Share this with your father.

609
00:42:30,510 --> 00:42:32,890
I bought some snacks for you.

610
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:38,030
Ahjussi you're having a hard time, too.

611
00:42:38,030 --> 00:42:41,120
Calling him "Artist, Artist"...

612
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:43,150
 What artist? 

613
00:42:43,150 --> 00:42:46,880
 Never mind cartoons. He can't even draw a straight line. 

614
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:52,840
I still love your father's cartoons and respect him a lot.

615
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:55,080
The reason I had dreams of working in this field

616
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:59,520
and fulfilling that dream was all thanks to your father's cartoons.

617
00:43:03,230 --> 00:43:05,430
What's your dream?

618
00:43:07,330 --> 00:43:09,600
No such a thing for me.

619
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:15,330
If you have a dream, you turn out like that moron.

620
00:43:16,730 --> 00:43:19,800
My wish is to make money as soon as possible

621
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:23,670
and escape from this house.

622
00:43:29,050 --> 00:43:31,620
Give this to your father.

623
00:43:31,620 --> 00:43:35,020
It's the paperwork on the webtoon remake project.

624
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:37,740
Go in. I'll be back again.

625
00:43:39,590 --> 00:43:42,920
It won't make a difference no matter what you say to him.

626
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:45,843
The time has stopped ticking for him.

627
00:44:20,610 --> 00:44:24,880
 Gu Ae Ri 

628
00:44:43,450 --> 00:44:45,520
Happy birthday.

629
00:44:47,190 --> 00:44:49,760
 I told you I just need one. 

630
00:44:58,370 --> 00:45:01,240
 I feel bad that I couldn't buy you one. 

631
00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:08,620
 They are pretty now that I see them in one place. 

632
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:12,670
Nuna.

633
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:24,980
 Heaven Memorial Park 

634
00:45:24,980 --> 00:45:27,590
 Heaven's Post Office 

635
00:45:27,590 --> 00:45:29,870
 To my friend whom I miss so much. 

636
00:45:29,870 --> 00:45:32,190
 Happy birthday. 

637
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:52,690
I should quit eating late-night snacks.

638
00:45:57,950 --> 00:45:59,890
Jun Yeong?

639
00:46:01,429 --> 00:46:03,279
I heard you took a day off.

640
00:46:03,279 --> 00:46:05,575
Did you come to read comic books?

641
00:46:05,575 --> 00:46:07,555
Why don't you go in?

642
00:46:12,410 --> 00:46:13,900
That's right!

643
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:16,919
Considering you're our VVIP, you really didn't come by that much.

644
00:46:21,077 --> 00:46:22,607
Do you want to eat ramen?

645
00:46:22,607 --> 00:46:24,220
I'll make you some.

646
00:46:24,220 --> 00:46:25,843
Come in.

647
00:46:27,810 --> 00:46:29,520
Come in.

648
00:46:35,882 --> 00:46:37,652
There.

649
00:46:42,822 --> 00:46:49,010
I don't know about other dishes, but I make unbelievable ramen.

650
00:47:03,700 --> 00:47:05,700
- Right? 
 - It really is delicious.

651
00:47:05,762 --> 00:47:08,222
The true taste of ramen is when you eat it in a comic book cafe.

652
00:47:08,222 --> 00:47:10,305
It's the real thing.

653
00:47:15,042 --> 00:47:17,050
Thank you.

654
00:47:18,862 --> 00:47:21,472
For making you ramen?

655
00:47:21,472 --> 00:47:23,130
Yes.

656
00:47:28,852 --> 00:47:31,452
Were you reading Artist Ma's comics again?

657
00:47:31,452 --> 00:47:32,782
Yes.

658
00:47:32,782 --> 00:47:34,522
I mean, it's so fun no matter how many times I read it.

659
00:47:34,522 --> 00:47:37,185
The masterpiece is definitely set apart.

660
00:47:37,185 --> 00:47:39,593
It'd be nice if Yu Na got to read this, too.

661
00:47:39,593 --> 00:47:43,729
I felt so bad that she just hated all comics.

662
00:47:43,729 --> 00:47:46,780
What if you brought her here?

663
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:52,535
I didn't know it until I came here, either.

664
00:47:52,535 --> 00:47:55,175
How fun comic books are.

665
00:47:55,175 --> 00:47:57,532
I wonder if Yu Na feels that way because she doesn't know it yet.

666
00:47:57,532 --> 00:48:00,932
Why didn't I think of that?

667
00:48:00,932 --> 00:48:02,932
Thank you!

668
00:48:02,932 --> 00:48:05,985
The price of ramen.

669
00:48:05,985 --> 00:48:07,962
Of course, an elite is different.

670
00:48:07,962 --> 00:48:10,820
Gosh, I should've made you two!

671
00:48:13,022 --> 00:48:15,265
Do you need anything else?

672
00:48:15,265 --> 00:48:18,230
- Do you have rice? 
- Rice, rice, rice.

673
00:48:21,650 --> 00:48:23,620
Welcome!

674
00:48:27,220 --> 00:48:28,982
Hi!

675
00:48:29,025 --> 00:48:31,165
When are you done?

676
00:48:31,165 --> 00:48:33,382
I'm done after I put these away.

677
00:48:33,425 --> 00:48:35,590
Really?

678
00:48:36,835 --> 00:48:38,412
Should I put this here?

679
00:48:38,412 --> 00:48:39,752
It's okay. I should do it.

680
00:48:39,752 --> 00:48:44,072
I want to take you somewhere after finishing your shift as soon as possible.

681
00:48:44,072 --> 00:48:46,752
You haven't eaten yet, right?

682
00:48:46,752 --> 00:48:49,222
What kind of words do you guys use these days?

683
00:48:49,222 --> 00:48:51,682
Do you say things like "Whatchamacallit"?

684
00:48:51,682 --> 00:48:52,932
No.

685
00:48:52,932 --> 00:48:55,412
- You don't?
 - That's right.

686
00:48:55,412 --> 00:48:56,752
Isn't that trendy these days?

687
00:48:56,752 --> 00:49:00,842
They may not say that these days, but there's one more step above that saying.

688
00:49:00,842 --> 00:49:02,402
I heard people don't say "King-batne*" these days, either.
&lt;( Means pissed, angry )

689
00:49:02,402 --> 00:49:06,602
I heard people say "King-baterassu" or "King's succession." Something like that.

690
00:49:07,872 --> 00:49:10,872
Ta-da! It's this place.

691
00:49:10,872 --> 00:49:12,972
 Comic Book Cafe 

692
00:49:15,699 --> 00:49:17,022
I don't like comic books.

693
00:49:17,022 --> 00:49:18,422
No, no, no.

694
00:49:18,422 --> 00:49:19,782
It's my home.

695
00:49:19,782 --> 00:49:21,082
It's my home.  You don't have to read comic books.

696
00:49:21,082 --> 00:49:22,632
Let's go in and eat dinner.

697
00:49:22,632 --> 00:49:24,682
Let's eat something yummy.

698
00:49:26,952 --> 00:49:28,512
Let's go in!

699
00:49:28,512 --> 00:49:30,932
We're here. We're here.

700
00:49:32,532 --> 00:49:35,852
- Welcome.
 - Hello!

701
00:49:43,102 --> 00:49:46,712
You can read everything that's in here.

702
00:49:58,092 --> 00:50:02,320
I don't read comic books.

703
00:50:03,492 --> 00:50:04,642
 Math 1 

704
00:50:04,642 --> 00:50:08,312
You must be busy working part-time, yet you want to make the grades, too, huh?

705
00:50:08,355 --> 00:50:11,905
I must have the basics down, so I can make a living in the future.

706
00:50:11,905 --> 00:50:13,329
Nice.

707
00:50:13,372 --> 00:50:16,532
Mother, two kimchi fried rice, please.

708
00:50:16,532 --> 00:50:18,725
Sure, ma'am.

709
00:50:32,842 --> 00:50:34,812
Enjoy.

710
00:50:34,812 --> 00:50:37,802
- Thank you for this food.
 - Thank you.

711
00:50:50,752 --> 00:50:53,162
Is it to your liking?

712
00:50:53,162 --> 00:50:54,322
It's delicious.

713
00:50:54,322 --> 00:50:58,712
Whatever you eat, if you eat it in a comic book cafe, it's twice as good.

714
00:51:07,122 --> 00:51:08,992
Is it your mother?

715
00:51:08,992 --> 00:51:10,272
Yes.

716
00:51:10,272 --> 00:51:14,262
It's my favorite picture out of the ones we took together.

717
00:51:15,422 --> 00:51:17,832
You're so cute, Yu Na!

718
00:51:17,832 --> 00:51:19,952
Oh, my goodness!

719
00:51:21,262 --> 00:51:23,172
This quote...

720
00:51:23,172 --> 00:51:27,242
Oh, it's from a saying that my mom used to say all the time.

721
00:51:27,242 --> 00:51:34,002
While saying that, she came up with one good event every day.

722
00:51:34,002 --> 00:51:36,295
Even if it was a small thing.

723
00:51:38,163 --> 00:51:40,613
"With one fragment of happy memories from the past,

724
00:51:40,613 --> 00:51:43,742
a person could be satisfied for the rest of his life."

725
00:51:43,742 --> 00:51:46,882
"So for your future,

726
00:51:46,882 --> 00:51:49,542
I wish you a little bit more happiness today."

727
00:51:49,542 --> 00:51:51,862
How do you know that?

728
00:51:55,062 --> 00:52:00,342
The quote your mom used to tell you is a very famous line.

729
00:52:01,012 --> 00:52:03,912
From "Please, Time Machine."

730
00:52:06,822 --> 00:52:13,252
Yu Na, your mother must've loved your father's comic books a lot.

731
00:52:25,682 --> 00:52:28,842
 Please, Time Machine 

732
00:52:29,922 --> 00:52:32,672
 Ma Hae Gyu 

733
00:52:52,152 --> 00:52:54,152
Come over next time, and let's eat ramen.

734
00:52:54,152 --> 00:52:56,062
Let's eat, okay?

735
00:52:56,062 --> 00:52:58,262
Okay, go in.

736
00:52:59,182 --> 00:53:01,012
You didn't have to walk me home.

737
00:53:01,012 --> 00:53:03,872
I wanted to exercise. I wanted to walk, and that's why I came.

738
00:53:03,872 --> 00:53:05,952
Here. Go in.

739
00:53:09,192 --> 00:53:10,842
Bye.

740
00:53:13,032 --> 00:53:16,202
Gosh. Hurry up and go in.

741
00:53:16,972 --> 00:53:18,882
Bye!

742
00:53:39,772 --> 00:53:42,172
Where did he go so late?

743
00:54:31,242 --> 00:54:33,452
Hello, Artist Ma.

744
00:54:36,362 --> 00:54:39,902
I wanted to say something to you, Artist Ma.

745
00:54:39,902 --> 00:54:42,212
I have nothing to say to you.

746
00:54:44,832 --> 00:54:47,832
Your work touched my heart.

747
00:54:47,832 --> 00:54:50,462
I really respect your thoughts as a creator.

748
00:54:50,462 --> 00:54:52,042
But...

749
00:54:54,692 --> 00:54:57,462
if you consider Yu Na,

750
00:54:58,872 --> 00:55:01,532
you shouldn't continue to live like this.

751
00:55:01,532 --> 00:55:04,262
What do you mean, "Live like this"?

752
00:55:05,092 --> 00:55:08,262
If I couldn't live like this,

753
00:55:08,262 --> 00:55:11,322
I would've never started drawing cartoons, to begin with!

754
00:55:11,322 --> 00:55:14,252
Whether it's this alcohol or whatever, no matter how much I pour

755
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:17,960
I have a hole in my heart that I can't fill! That's why I draw!

756
00:55:19,242 --> 00:55:22,162
That's how a masterpiece is born.

757
00:55:22,972 --> 00:55:25,092
You don't believe me?

758
00:55:25,092 --> 00:55:26,692
If you don't believe me,

759
00:55:26,692 --> 00:55:31,722
try filling up the void in the hearts of all the artists!

760
00:55:31,722 --> 00:55:37,182
And see if any good work comes out of them or not!

761
00:55:48,002 --> 00:55:51,282
The most valuable masterpiece you made...

762
00:55:53,432 --> 00:55:59,332
The artwork you should feel most responsible for is Yu Na, isn't it?

763
00:56:27,312 --> 00:56:29,812
Did you go out and buy alcohol again?

764
00:56:30,722 --> 00:56:33,582
Don't come into my room without my permission.

765
00:56:33,582 --> 00:56:38,292
I thought you went out to work or something.

766
00:56:38,292 --> 00:56:39,712
I should've known better.

767
00:56:39,712 --> 00:56:41,892
I'm a cartoonist.

768
00:56:42,552 --> 00:56:49,512
My job is to come up with storylines and draw at home.

769
00:56:50,122 --> 00:56:52,282
Give me a break.

770
00:56:52,282 --> 00:56:54,852
All you do is drink and gamble all the time.

771
00:56:54,852 --> 00:56:59,432
You always only say that you're a cartoonist, an artist. Doesn't it bother your conscience?

772
00:56:59,432 --> 00:57:02,902
What cartoon? You can't even draw a straight line anymore.

773
00:57:02,902 --> 00:57:05,632
Please come to your senses and know yourself!

774
00:57:05,632 --> 00:57:08,902
- What the hell do you know?
 - I know everything!

775
00:57:15,782 --> 00:57:18,832
 Please, Time Machine  
 I saw your picture in this book.

776
00:57:20,192 --> 00:57:22,452
You really shone through.

777
00:57:22,452 --> 00:57:25,772
But that person is no more.

778
00:57:25,772 --> 00:57:29,242
Just give up now and see your reality! Please!

779
00:57:29,242 --> 00:57:33,702
With the work you desired to do, people acknowledged you for it, and you were happy!

780
00:57:33,702 --> 00:57:36,432
Wasn't that enough?

781
00:57:36,432 --> 00:57:41,452
Ordinary people live their whole lives diligently without those moments.

782
00:57:41,452 --> 00:57:47,842
They don't obsess about the past glory and dream like you and waste their life!

783
00:57:56,662 --> 00:57:59,410
If I don't draw cartoons...

784
00:58:00,340 --> 00:58:03,730
what am I not drawing?

785
00:58:06,582 --> 00:58:08,932
I'm nothing.

786
00:58:18,452 --> 00:58:20,892
Why are you nothing?

787
00:58:22,122 --> 00:58:24,352
You're a dad.

788
00:58:26,902 --> 00:58:29,632
You're Ma Yu Na's dad.

789
00:58:29,632 --> 00:58:31,502
A famous cartoonist. A genius cartoonist.

790
00:58:31,502 --> 00:58:34,422
I don't need any of that!

791
00:58:34,422 --> 00:58:37,752
I never needed any of that from the beginning!

792
00:58:37,752 --> 00:58:39,290
Just

793
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:42,250
be a dad to me.

794
00:58:43,532 --> 00:58:45,842
An ordinary dad.

795
00:59:26,192 --> 00:59:28,940
 Neon Webtoon Contents Service Team 

796
00:59:38,212 --> 00:59:39,792
Artist Ma!

797
00:59:40,770 --> 00:59:42,680
Artist Ma.

798
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:43,740
Why?

799
00:59:43,740 --> 00:59:45,732
Hello, Artist Ma.

800
00:59:53,222 --> 00:59:55,295
Hello, sir.

801
00:59:56,882 --> 00:59:59,792
Aigoo, Artist Ma. You're here.

802
01:00:00,722 --> 01:00:02,845
We were going to come and get you.

803
01:00:02,845 --> 01:00:06,295
I'm perfectly fine. Why bother?

804
01:00:06,295 --> 01:00:10,112
The contract from that time give it to me again.

805
01:00:16,972 --> 01:00:20,010
 Contract 

806
01:00:25,042 --> 01:00:28,822
Where should I put my seal?

807
01:00:30,472 --> 01:00:32,242
Pardon?

808
01:00:32,962 --> 01:00:34,682
My seal.

809
01:00:34,682 --> 01:00:36,902
I'll put the seal on it right now.

810
01:00:38,012 --> 01:00:39,972
Gosh, sir!

811
01:00:39,972 --> 01:00:42,932
T-Thank you... You can put this on two sides.

812
01:00:42,932 --> 01:00:44,972
- Hey... 
 - Okay.

813
01:00:44,972 --> 01:00:47,592
Thank you, sir. Yes...

814
01:01:03,632 --> 01:01:05,612
Over here, too.

815
01:01:09,942 --> 01:01:12,272
 Ma Hae Gyu 

816
01:01:12,272 --> 01:01:13,722
Sir, gosh...

817
01:01:13,722 --> 01:01:17,292
Gosh. Th-Thank you so much.

818
01:01:19,102 --> 01:01:23,602
Could you give us a moment alone?

819
01:01:23,602 --> 01:01:25,782
You came to see us for the first time in a while.

820
01:01:25,782 --> 01:01:27,892
You should eat with us before you go.

821
01:01:27,892 --> 01:01:29,092
It's okay.

822
01:01:29,092 --> 01:01:32,472
I can just go home and eat.

823
01:01:37,422 --> 01:01:42,742
You just be sure to keep the promise you made to me.

824
01:01:44,332 --> 01:01:45,762
You must.

825
01:01:45,762 --> 01:01:47,322
Okay.

826
01:01:50,432 --> 01:01:52,562
I'm counting on you.

827
01:01:52,562 --> 01:01:54,062
Yes.

828
01:01:57,352 --> 01:01:59,222
Goodbye, sir.

829
01:02:38,162 --> 01:02:40,382
 I'm reading your comic, Dad. 

830
01:02:40,382 --> 01:02:43,302
 It's really fun and moving. 

831
01:02:44,162 --> 01:02:46,322
Where shall I go?

832
01:02:48,652 --> 01:02:50,652
To the future.

833
01:02:51,272 --> 01:02:52,682
Excuse me?

834
01:02:56,982 --> 01:03:00,062
To the future far, far away.

835
01:03:16,612 --> 01:03:18,352
Things wrapped up nicely.

836
01:03:18,352 --> 01:03:20,092
That's right.

837
01:03:20,092 --> 01:03:24,572
Going forward, I hope Yu Na and Artist Ma only have things to smile about.

838
01:03:24,572 --> 01:03:26,562
I'm sure that'll happen.

839
01:03:29,382 --> 01:03:30,812
Hyeong, you're back.

840
01:03:30,812 --> 01:03:32,562
PD On Ma Eum.

841
01:03:32,562 --> 01:03:35,462
What did you say to Artist Ma?

842
01:03:36,222 --> 01:03:37,432
Well...

843
01:03:37,432 --> 01:03:41,482
He says he's grateful that you recognized his most valuable masterpiece.

844
01:03:41,482 --> 01:03:43,882
Is he talking about a new series?

845
01:03:46,142 --> 01:03:47,972
No.

846
01:03:50,972 --> 01:03:54,392
 Daewoon Girls High School, Judo Gym 

847
01:03:55,722 --> 01:03:56,582
Hey, you're here.

848
01:03:56,625 --> 01:03:59,335
Hey, they're doing well.

849
01:03:59,335 --> 01:04:02,172
What's Ma Eum up to these days?

850
01:04:02,172 --> 01:04:04,932
Is she still on a break?

851
01:04:04,932 --> 01:04:06,082
She's working these days.

852
01:04:06,100 --> 01:04:09,200
Working? What kind of work? In a semi-pro team?

853
01:04:09,252 --> 01:04:11,912
No. She got into Neon. Neon.

854
01:04:11,912 --> 01:04:13,472
She's creating webtoons...

855
01:04:13,472 --> 01:04:14,492
What?

856
01:04:14,492 --> 01:04:16,462
What? Now is not the time for her to do that.

857
01:04:16,462 --> 01:04:18,172
At the upcoming national competition,

858
01:04:18,172 --> 01:04:20,932
the people who used to hold Ma Eum back,

859
01:04:20,932 --> 01:04:24,462
all those morons will be off the judging panel.

860
01:04:32,322 --> 01:04:34,372
Jun Yeong, are you busy today?

861
01:04:34,372 --> 01:04:37,292
No. I don't have much going on today.

862
01:04:37,902 --> 01:04:40,082
Why?

863
01:04:40,082 --> 01:04:42,852
I wanted to get help from you as a colleague.

864
01:04:51,282 --> 01:04:54,152
This is a nice scent.

865
01:04:54,152 --> 01:04:56,072
It's nice.

866
01:04:56,072 --> 01:04:57,502
Wood scent?

867
01:04:57,502 --> 01:04:59,482
It's refreshing...

868
01:04:59,482 --> 01:05:03,400
I smell a hint of ocean. It's nice.

869
01:05:04,362 --> 01:05:09,412
The wood scent, citrus...

870
01:05:09,412 --> 01:05:12,812
You're an analyzer, Ma Eum.

871
01:05:12,812 --> 01:05:17,502
The person you're gifting. Do I know this person?

872
01:05:17,502 --> 01:05:20,150
Yes. Well...

873
01:05:21,642 --> 01:05:24,342
My father.

874
01:05:24,342 --> 01:05:29,722
I feel terribly sorry toward my dad and I have a lot to thank him for as well.

875
01:05:29,722 --> 01:05:32,730
I don't think I should keep it in much longer.

876
01:05:35,542 --> 01:05:39,470
This smells very nice.

877
01:05:46,299 --> 01:05:47,629
Thanks for coming here with me.

878
01:05:47,629 --> 01:05:49,482
I feel a little bit more courageous.

879
01:05:49,482 --> 01:05:51,552
So, you do get afraid, too.

880
01:05:51,552 --> 01:05:54,272
Of course, I get afraid.

881
01:05:54,272 --> 01:05:57,890
But I still go for it.

882
01:05:59,022 --> 01:06:02,232
Convey your ma-eum* to him.
  (Ma Eum means heart in Korean.) 

883
01:06:03,682 --> 01:06:05,082
Okay.

884
01:06:17,892 --> 01:06:19,622
Fighting!

885
01:06:34,652 --> 01:06:36,042
Let's go!

886
01:06:36,042 --> 01:06:37,272
What are you doing?

887
01:06:37,272 --> 01:06:40,622
Why do you throw your weight forward?  Are you wrestling a cow?

888
01:06:40,622 --> 01:06:41,672
It's your left side.

889
01:06:41,672 --> 01:06:44,492
Go in like this and turn left. Like this.

890
01:06:44,492 --> 01:06:47,062
And push your left in like this...

891
01:06:48,492 --> 01:06:50,382
Great!

892
01:06:50,382 --> 01:06:52,002
Good job! See? That worked!

893
01:06:52,002 --> 01:06:53,832
- Thank you!
 - Sure.

894
01:06:54,622 --> 01:06:56,432
- Dad.
 - Good job!

895
01:06:56,432 --> 01:06:58,242
Thank you!

896
01:07:00,012 --> 01:07:01,542
What's going on?

897
01:07:01,542 --> 01:07:03,192
Why did you come here?

898
01:07:03,192 --> 01:07:05,262
Just because...

899
01:07:19,605 --> 01:07:23,358
What's up? I can't believe you came to see me first.

900
01:07:23,358 --> 01:07:25,208
What do you mean?

901
01:07:26,712 --> 01:07:28,932
I was just wondering how you were doing lately.

902
01:07:28,972 --> 01:07:31,002
We didn't really run into each other at home, you know.

903
01:07:31,045 --> 01:07:34,305
That's because you were avoiding me.

904
01:07:36,272 --> 01:07:38,002
Did it show?

905
01:07:38,002 --> 01:07:39,862
A lot.

906
01:07:48,332 --> 01:07:50,412
Thanks, Dad.

907
01:07:50,412 --> 01:07:52,272
Gross. What's this out of the blue?

908
01:07:52,272 --> 01:07:54,272
Just because...

909
01:07:54,272 --> 01:07:55,942
Out of the blue,

910
01:07:55,942 --> 01:08:01,852
I realized you remained in your place reliably as the head of our household.

911
01:08:01,852 --> 01:08:03,982
I think I took that for granted.

912
01:08:03,982 --> 01:08:06,822
But it's a tough thing to do in reality.

913
01:08:08,682 --> 01:08:12,942
Wow, did my daughter mature now that she's working and making money?

914
01:08:12,942 --> 01:08:14,952
I guess so.

915
01:08:17,892 --> 01:08:21,792
I know I was your dream, Dad.

916
01:08:21,792 --> 01:08:26,102
I wanted to fulfill that dream for you.

917
01:08:27,872 --> 01:08:30,602
I'm sorry I couldn't fulfill it for you.

918
01:08:36,722 --> 01:08:38,222
Here.

919
01:08:39,462 --> 01:08:40,682
What's this?

920
01:08:40,682 --> 01:08:43,665
I wanted to win an Olympic medal and give you a grand gift.

921
01:08:43,665 --> 01:08:45,825
But I can't do that anymore.

922
01:08:45,825 --> 01:08:49,012
I didn't get you anything when I got my first paycheck.

923
01:08:49,995 --> 01:08:52,862
I didn't give up on you yet.

924
01:08:52,862 --> 01:08:55,222
So, don't say you're sorry.

925
01:08:56,512 --> 01:08:59,522
- Dad—
 - Later on...

926
01:08:59,522 --> 01:09:02,812
there will come a day when you'll be much more grateful to me

927
01:09:02,812 --> 01:09:05,632
for not giving up on you so quickly.

928
01:09:53,032 --> 01:09:55,532
Can you give that to me?

929
01:09:57,282 --> 01:10:00,212
How did you come here, Jun Yeong?

930
01:10:03,542 --> 01:10:08,132
That gift, give it to me.

931
01:10:14,582 --> 01:10:16,402
- Hey, PD Kwon. 
- Hyeongnim.

932
01:10:16,402 --> 01:10:17,572
What brings you here?

933
01:10:17,572 --> 01:10:19,012
I have to take care of something at the HR office.

934
01:10:19,051 --> 01:10:21,721
Really? See you later then.

935
01:10:22,788 --> 01:10:23,878
Hyeongnim.

936
01:10:23,922 --> 01:10:25,012
Huh?

937
01:10:25,012 --> 01:10:28,512
I heard that Young Toon's next Editor-in-Chief will get an amazing offer.

938
01:10:28,512 --> 01:10:30,142
Wow, good enough to spread rumors?

939
01:10:30,142 --> 01:10:33,032
Bastards, tell them to contact me, man.

940
01:10:33,032 --> 01:10:34,512
Hyeongnim.

941
01:10:34,512 --> 01:10:36,302
What?

942
01:10:36,302 --> 01:10:40,002
I guess you haven't heard who's being discussed as a candidate.

943
01:10:40,002 --> 01:10:41,782
Who is it?

944
01:10:43,742 --> 01:10:49,442
 We're considering doubling your current salary, at least. 

945
01:10:49,492 --> 01:10:51,780
 We'll give you stock options as well. 

946
01:10:51,780 --> 01:10:59,620


947
01:10:59,620 --> 01:11:03,125
 They're contacting Ji Hyeong. 

948
01:11:03,152 --> 01:11:06,650
 I don't think Ji Hyeong will have an easy time turning them down this time.

 The chance of becoming an editor-in-chief doesn't come easily, does it? 

963
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:19,200
 I'm seriously looking deep into my heart. 

964
01:12:19,200 --> 01:12:24,500
 That's what I want to see.  

965
01:12:24,500 --> 01:12:28,460
 It's him. The moron who caused Ae Ri's death. 

966
01:12:30,050 --> 01:12:33,920
 You just think about yourself. Just think about yourself all the way. 

967
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:38,700
