 Today's Webtoon 

3
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:55,000
 Breaking news! The 33rd person in a serial case was reported missing. 

4
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 Young people in their 20-30s are disappearing one after another. 

5
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,420
 This is increasing fear among many citizens. 

6
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:05,160
 Police are investigating and searching for the missing people, but 

7
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:09,450
 another man has been reported missing for four days 

8
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:13,350
 and the situation is becoming worse. 

9
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:30,970
Stop fooling around and come out.

10
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:48,510
The beginning always seems plausible.

11
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,220
You are San Ha.

12
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:06,900
Why don't you take off your helmet?

13
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,860
I wanted to see your face. It's been a while.

14
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:10,610
How disappointing.

15
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:13,900
Are you scared?

16
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:23,240
You have a lot to be disappointed about.

17
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,560
My wish is never to see your face.

18
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,090
Your wish will come true.

19
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:43,770
You'll never see me again when you croak.

20
00:02:57,810 --> 00:02:59,500
It'll be fun until the end today, right?

21
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:02,990
I think today's going to be our last day.

22
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:04,890
 It's so fun every time I watch this. 

23
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:06,870
 San Ha is the best!

Hello.

28

Chicken, right?

29
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:37,620
 Everything on the menu is available to-go 

30

I'm ready for more.

♫  My memory that is closed shut needs someone to give me strength  ♫

00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:54,860
Who ordered chicken?

35
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:56,850
Over here!

Seonbae-nim, how are you?

44
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:29,460
 Are you still taking time off from Judo? 

45
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:31,000
Yes.

46
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,190
 Are you interested in a night shift part-time job?

 Welcome!!

 Neon Webtoon Artists' Night 

51
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,980
Excuse me, could you take a photo? Yes, thank you so much.

52
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,600
Thank you.

53
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:28,580
On Ma Eum!

54
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:30,330
Hello!

55
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:38,220
Neon Webtoon

56
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:40,710
This is for you.

57
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:43,020
Thank you for coming.

58
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:45,990
Geez, the kid who was supposed to come couldn't come.

59
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:47,350
I'm the one who should thank you.

60
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:48,720
You gave me this precious job.

61
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,250
Why? Are you short on money?

62
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:52,440
Aren't you going back to the Athlete's Village?

63
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,200
I'm thinking about it.

64
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,290
Didn't your injury heal by now?

65
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:59,260
My heart still is...

66
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,100
I'm just trying different things for now.

67
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,500
You did this kind of job in school, right?

68
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,970
I'll assign you to a section.

69
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:08,590
If you see any suspicious person or run into an unexpected issue, call out immediately.

70
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:10,360
Yes, sir!

71
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:19,050
 NEON

A2 area has no issues.

73
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:38,080
 Wow, it's the artist Baek Eo Jin! 
   

74
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,860
 Artist Oh Yun! 
   

75
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:42,540
 Did artist Na Gang Nam come too? 

76
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:47,320
 (Various webtoon titles and artists' names) 

77
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:50,550
Hello!

78
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:58,750
I'm Jang Man Cheol, an editor-in-chief from Neon Webtoon Service Team.

79
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:02,770
To all the artists who came to this year's Annual Neon Webtoon Authors' Night,

80
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:05,340
Thank you so much. So many are here tonight.

81
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:07,740
It's nice to see some of you who I haven't seen for a long time,

82
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:10,250
and there may be a few that I am tired of seeing every day.

83
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:12,670
I didn't come out here to nag you about the script, yes.

84
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:14,810
So please make yourselves comfortable and enjoy.

85
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:16,060
All right!

86
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:19,950
It's been a year and a half since Neon Webtoon was launched.

87
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:22,860
The reason we become so successful in a short period

88
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:27,090
is because all the creative staff sitting here have written great works.

89
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:30,930
Going forward, our Neon Webtoon Service will do our best to spread

90
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:34,410
your precious creative content to be cherished domestically and globally.

91
00:08:34,410 --> 00:08:37,390
We'll give our utmost best to make that happen.

92
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:39,610
 Gumiho Princess artist, Na Gang Nam. (Gumiho = Nine-tailed Fox) 

93
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,850
Okay, now

94
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:45,970
we'll announce awards for artists who made Neon Webtoon shine

95
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:48,970
with their outstanding work this year.

96
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:51,620
The award category is the Newbie of the Year Award.

97
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:53,460
Looks like Neon spent some money this year.

98
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:54,720
What's up with that?

99
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,060
Neon, their name value depends on it.

100
00:08:56,060 --> 00:09:00,210
Maybe they got slammed for making it too simple last year.

101
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:02,610
All right, I'll go right into awarding the winner.

102
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:05,280
First, the Newbie of the Year Award.

103
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,390
Automatic reactions.

104
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:11,760
Wow, of course. Our artists are so quick.

105
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,730
We have a huge newbie artist who will make our nation shine!

106
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:17,520
You'll all be shocked.

107
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:20,770
Dragon's Dream! Artist Baek Eo Jin!

108
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:29,100
 Newbie of the Year Award, Dragon's Dream, Artist Baek Eo Jin 

109
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:38,060
 Newbie of the Year Award, Dragon's Dream, Artist Baek Eo Jin 

110
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,230
Sir, we are your fans!

111
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:51,260
- Can we take pictures? 
- Yes!

112
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:52,930
Thank you!

113
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:56,050
Thank you!

114
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:57,860
- You are so handsome.
- Can I take one, too?

115
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:59,140
You want me to take it for you?

116
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:01,220
One, two, three.

117
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,080
 Please take pictures of us. 

118
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,700
 Newbie of the Year Award 

119
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,360
So awesome!

120
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:11,490
 It's so crazy! 

121
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:20,240
Mr. Baek Eo Jin, sir!

122
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:23,180
Thank you for coming.

123
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:24,540
It's nice

124
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:27,810
to see young artists after a long time.

125
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:29,570
I even received a Newbie of the Year Award.

126
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:31,820
We didn't offend you, did we?

127
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:35,440
We all know you drew comics for over 30 years.

128
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,850
But since you just started the webtoon series this year,

129
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:41,510
we left the award's name as is to express our warm welcome.

130
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:44,020
That actually made me feel good.

131
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:47,700
It's been decades since I received the Newbie of the Year Award.

132
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,990
I never thought I would receive this award again.

133
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:53,590
It's better than the Lifetime Achievement Award.

134
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:56,750
Rather, I'm thankful to you for saying that.

135
00:10:56,750 --> 00:11:00,680
You have to continue working in Webtoon for another 30 years.

136
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,570
I'll try my best.

137
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:03,490
Yes, sir.

138
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:05,100
Bye now.

139
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:09,380
Get home safe.

- What's the problem? 
 - What?

156

- What's the problem? 
 - Security, please take him outside.

- Hold on. I'm not a weirdo.

He's a stalker. A total stalker!

00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:32,600
I told you.

166
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,420
I'm not a weirdo.

167
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,950
I'm so sorry! I'm so sorry!

168
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:39,200
You're too much the type to use your body first.

169
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:46,900
I understand you are only doing your job, you know?

170
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,530
My apologies.

171
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:50,920
I'm sorry!

172
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:56,480
♫    ♫

173
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,990
- Let me just watch this. 
- Come outside.

174
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:00,730
Just this! One song!

175
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:02,590
Come on. Don't go!

176
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:05,400
You told me to come to the party.

177
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,910
I told you to come when you've met your deadline.

178
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:11,460
I have to upload it today, but you didn't give me the manuscript yet.

179
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:13,920
Okay, I'll just leave after eating.

180
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,180
I hadn't eaten anything because I was busy greeting people.

181
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:18,660
You weren't greeting. You were busy watching the girl groups.

182
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:20,830
You saw all the shows. Let's go now.

183
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:25,580
I'll buy and deliver you better and more expensive food.

184
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:27,240
Geez!

185
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,530
Why are you being such a stickler?

186
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:31,360
Artist Na.

187
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:35,060
If you miss the deadline today,

188
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:37,020
it will have a huge impact on our service.

189
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:40,280
PPL (pay-per-lead), traffic, and advertisement cost...

190
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:44,360
Gumiho Princess is the main title for Neon.

191
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:47,750
You are our main artist.

192
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,760
I heard you say that they're also the billboard of the company etc.

193
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,790
You were all, "You're our main artist-nim!"

194
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:55,560
I saw everything earlier.

195
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:58,520
Excuse me, sir...

196
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,410
May I have your autograph?

197
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:02,840
- Me?
 - Yes! I

198
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:05,740
I've been a fan of Gumiho Princess for a long time.

199
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:09,570
Look at this. Can you sign here?

200
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:13,480
Oh, boy, I'm a little shy...

201
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:20,580
What's your name?

202
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:22,230
On Ma Eum.

203
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:24,140
Oh Ma Eum. Nice name.

204
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:27,130
On Ma Eum.

205
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:29,390
It's done. Here it is.

206
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,490
I really enjoy reading Gumiho Princess these days.

207
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:35,160
I'm looking forward to today's episode too.

208
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:37,160
Sir, fighting!

209
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:40,660
Go ahead and finish your conversation.

210
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:42,980
Thank you!

211
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:44,650
No, thank you.

212
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:46,660
Then,

213
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:48,560
I have to go finish my work now.

214
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,950
Right away.

215
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:07,430
Artist-nim! Artist-nim, can we take a picture together?

216
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,260
I don't like taking photos.

217
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:13,540
Pomme! You're Artist Pomme, right?

218
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:15,240
Daebak! Daebak!

219
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:18,030
What are you doing?

220
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:19,760
Live streaming.

221
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:24,110
- Smile, Artist Pomme. 
- What are you doing?

222
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:25,690
Hey, show some manners.

223
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:27,280
Artist, I love you!

224
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,860
What the heck!

225
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:31,500
What are you doing? You are not an artist, right?

226
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:34,120
So what if I'm not an artist?

227
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:36,560
I already recorded everything!

228
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,350
- Give it to me. 
- Give it to you? Here, here.

229
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:41,050
Here. Don't want to.

230
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:44,090
- Give it to me.
 - Right. Here, here. Okay, take it.

231
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:45,580
Geez!

232
00:15:56,650 --> 00:15:58,270
Can you take his cell phone?

233
00:15:58,270 --> 00:16:00,860
Ouch! No, no!

234
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:04,040
- Give me the camera. 
- No, no!

235
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:10,240
Ouch, no, no...

236
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:13,300
We erased all recorded videos.

237
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:16,320
And we'll erase the live-cast videos as well.

238
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,460
This is why I didn't want to come here.

239
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:20,350
I'm so sorry, miss.

240
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:23,480
We should've managed better.

241
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:27,090
Pass on my thanks to her, please.

242
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:52,790
Thank you for your hard work today.

243
00:16:58,230 --> 00:17:03,540
Artist Pomme said she wanted to express her gratitude earlier.

244
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:07,360
Gosh, no. I'm fine. I just did what I should.

245
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:12,930
You said you like webtoons, right?

246
00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:17,350
Would you like a hard copy with Pomme's autograph?

247
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,690
- Really?
 - Of course.

248
00:17:21,690 --> 00:17:24,040
Please contact me here.

249
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:26,470
Send me your address.

250
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:28,130

00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:30,060

252
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:31,500
Okay.

266
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:43,300
Hey, where's Ma Eum?

267
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:44,630
On Ma Eum?

268
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:46,170
She went to work out in the morning.

269
00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:47,510
Did she even come home last night?

270
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:49,910
She worked out in the morning because she came home.

271
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:52,730
What is she doing going around all day?

272
00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:54,200
How long is she going to take this break?

273
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,790
Come on, come on now. Give Ma Eum some time.

274
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:59,400
You promised to give her six months.

275
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:03,250
You said you keep all the words you spit out, Coach On Gi Bong!

276
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:06,780
That's right, Coach. Enjoy your meal.

277
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:28,060
  Hello, this is Neon

278
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:39,510
 Hello, This message is from Neon. You have passed the initial screening for employment. Congratulations. 

279
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:07,120
Good, good, good.

280
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:11,360
Hello, I'm On Ma Eum.

281
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,040
Work and life balances are important aspects of modern days,

282
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:16,100
but the IT business is required to run 24 hours a day.

283
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:20,280
So I came physically prepared to work all night.

284
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:25,130
One.

285
00:22:25,130 --> 00:22:26,430

 Neon New Employee Recruitment, Interview Phase 1 

289
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:32,980
Whoa, you have proper form.

290
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:38,570
Thirty-one.

291
00:22:38,570 --> 00:22:40,170
Thirty-two.

292
00:22:40,170 --> 00:22:41,850
Thirty-three.

293
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:50,040
- How did you get accepted for doing push-ups well? 
 - Really!

294
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:52,090
You only have the final interview left then.

295
00:22:52,090 --> 00:22:56,170
If you pass that, you can become a new employee at Neon?

296
00:22:56,170 --> 00:22:58,700
Yeah! I feel like I'm dreaming!

297
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:01,530
- Daebak (awesome)!
 - I can't believe it, either!

298
00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:04,330
So, when are you going to tell Dad?

299
00:23:04,330 --> 00:23:06,830
Dad isn't going to give up that easy.

300
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:09,770
She didn't make it yet. Why tell him?

301
00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:11,350
It's only going to create noise.

302
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:15,960
That's right. Let me get accepted first and then persuade later.

303
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:18,450
True. There's more chance of being rejected anyway.

304
00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:21,430
Nu Ri, have you ever been hit by winter cabbage?

305
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:23,970
I've been hit by radish kimchi, but...

306
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:25,650
You need more vitamins.

307
00:23:25,650 --> 00:23:27,750
Yeah, you need to eat a lot of vegetables.

308

321
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:46,030
- Excuse me?
 - I will beat it for you.

322
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:57,110
"Fire in the Middle of the Night" vs. "Boss: Mysterious Monk"

323
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:02,880

324
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,840

I know.

326
00:25:10,730 --> 00:25:12,280
 This stop is Pyeong So station. 

327
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:15,460
 The exit doors are to your left. 

328
00:25:36,970 --> 00:25:38,930
 Coffee, Beverage 

329
00:25:38,930 --> 00:25:41,880
One chamomile tea and ice-shot-chu, please.

330
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,270
Excuse me?

331
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:45,330
- Ice-shot-chu.
- Pardon?

332
00:25:45,330 --> 00:25:47,860
- Ice—
 - Ice tea with an extra shot.

333
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:49,360
I see.

334
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:52,840
She's pretending not to understand on purpose.

335
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:55,500
You're using slang that doesn't suit you.

336
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:56,970
And incorrectly at that.

337
00:25:56,970 --> 00:25:58,480
Why do you keep doing that?

338
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:01,520
I'm a modern person. Modern and cool.

339
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,760
I'm going to order ice-la-va tomorrow.

340
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,810
It's ice-va-la (iced vanilla latte). Not ice-la-va.

341
00:26:05,810 --> 00:26:08,530
Your order's ready.

342
00:26:08,530 --> 00:26:10,210
Thank you.

343
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:14,580
Are you going to attend the final interview today?

344
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:16,560
Nuclearly boring.

345
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,240
How come?

346
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,670
I can't ask any questions.

347
00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:21,600
I can't ask what school or major.

348
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,010
If I ask any personal questions, I'll be ousted.

349
00:26:24,010 --> 00:26:28,170
A mistake can cost me, saying it was an oppressive interview and whatnot.

350
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:30,290
Don't kids watch baseball anymore?

351
00:26:30,290 --> 00:26:33,370
Do you know what they say when I ask which sports team they like?

352
00:26:33,370 --> 00:26:34,890
What do they say?

353
00:26:34,890 --> 00:26:36,840
They tell me pro gamer group names.

354
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:40,720
Because e-sports are also sports.

355
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,300
Game is not a sport!

356
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:45,580
Real sports needs bodies bustling on each other and get you fired up and sweaty.

357
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:48,450
In desperate situations, you're out of breath and trying to catch a breath.

358
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:51,050
This-this is real sports.

359
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:54,030
A person of long ago.

360
00:26:55,610 --> 00:26:57,610
Are you young then?

That's sports.

 The woman in front of us with cauliflower ears. 

367
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:32,190
 She's definitely a martial artist.

369
00:27:33,130 --> 00:27:34,980
 Would it be judo or wrestling? 

370
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:37,300
 She can be a mixed martial artist too. 

371

 Want to make a bet? 

372

 The loser pays for Hanwoo (Korean beef). 

373
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:58,270
 Judo. 

374
00:28:07,010 --> 00:28:08,080
- Why, why?
 - Hold on to it.

375
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,690
Why, why?

376
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:11,520
What are you going to do?

377
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:23,690
- What? 
 - Ouch, my back!

378
00:28:23,690 --> 00:28:25,010
Ouch!

379
00:28:25,010 --> 00:28:26,560
- Oh, my. 
- Ouch!

380
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:28,940
- Are you okay? 
- It's judo.

381
00:28:29,970 --> 00:28:32,040
Ouch, whoa...

382
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:34,060
- Oh, my!
 - You are a judo athlete, right?

383
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:35,830
I'm so sorry! My automatic reaction is...

384
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:37,830
It's okay. How many years did you train?

385
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:39,640
I...

386
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:41,060
I trained for 15 years.

387
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:43,690
No wonder. She moved instinctively, just like that.

388
00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:45,300
- Ouch. 
- My goodness.

389
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:47,350
- Aren't you late for the interview? 
 - Oh, right!

390
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:49,530
- Here.
 - Thanks. I'll buy you Hanwoo.

391
00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:51,050
You're awesome! Sorry about that.

392
00:28:51,050 --> 00:28:52,370
Sorry. Wow, but...

393
00:28:52,370 --> 00:28:53,450
Wow!

394
00:28:53,450 --> 00:28:55,320
Take care!

395
00:28:56,350 --> 00:28:58,010
So, are you okay?

396
00:28:58,010 --> 00:28:59,450
Yes, I'm okay.

397
00:28:59,450 --> 00:29:00,960
It's you, right?

398
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,940
- On...
 - Yes.

399
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:05,610
I'm On Ma Eum. You remember me.

400
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:08,380
It's hard to forget such judo skills.

401
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:10,120
My gosh.

402
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,090
- Are you here for an interview today?
 - Yes, that's right.

403
00:29:14,090 --> 00:29:15,400
Today's a very important day for you.

404
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,200
No, it's okay.

405
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,210
Wait a minute.

406
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:24,270
Would you prefer heads or tails?

407
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:27,780
- Excuse me?
 - Pick one.

408
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:29,680
Heads or tails?

409
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:32,560
Oh. All of a sudden?

410
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:34,280
Okay, I will pick...

411
00:29:34,890 --> 00:29:36,480
I'll pick heads.

412
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,990
Heads, okay.

413
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:39,220
Can you hold this for a minute?

414
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:41,440
- It's a bit hot. 
- Okay.

00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:10,120

 Final Interview Waiting Room 

421
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:47,500
 What's with this guy? 

422
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:49,370
 He doesn't seem nervous at all. 

423
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:15,590
This fell out of your pocket.

424
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:17,910
Oh, my! Thank you.

425
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:27,170
 You are a gold medal to me, my daughter. 

426
00:31:27,170 --> 00:31:29,850
 Don't be scared. Fighting.

 TN: n Korea gum is given to test-takers because the hope is they'll stick like gum. 

428
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:50,010
 I wonder if she was an athlete. 

429
00:31:59,990 --> 00:32:01,510
Do you want a piece of chewing gum?

430
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:03,080
No thanks.

431
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,160
Okay.

432
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:11,030
We'll have the next group in.

433
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:13,360
Ms. On Ma Eum, Mr. Gu Jun Yeong,

434
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:16,510
- Mr. Han Seung Hun, Ms. Kim Bo Ram... 
- Yes.

435
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:24,190
Aren't you going to spit out your chewing gum?

436
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:27,000
Oh, my! Thank you.

437
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:32,010
 I'm screwed! 

438
00:32:32,010 --> 00:32:34,640
I'm screwed!

439
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:39,750
You just were extremely lucky up until now.

440
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:42,360
Hey, you should be comforting me.

441
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:43,290
I'm just saying...

442
00:32:43,290 --> 00:32:47,520
You said they reject SKY (Seoul National, Korea, and Yonsei) graduates and people with the highly stacked resumes.

443
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:52,260
It's a true miracle that you made it to the final interview.

444
00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:57,640
Neon integrates diverse content and delivers personalized content that meets clients' needs.

445
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:59,820
And in the process, the IP (intellectual property) revenue is maximized

446
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:01,760
with a smooth circulation in the platform structure.

447
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,020
And not only currently, but

448
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:07,240
I believe there's high growth potential in the future, and that's why I applied for this position.

449
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,370
 98, 99... 

450
00:33:09,370 --> 00:33:11,660
Ms. On Ma Eum...

451
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:13,760
 Resume 

452
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:18,660
- You just did judo. 
 - Yes, that's right.

453
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:22,080
But she scored very high on the aptitude test.

454
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:25,380
Why did you apply to our company, Ms. On Ma Eum?

455
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,460
I...

456
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:32,610
used Neon's platform to listen to music during judo training

457
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:37,740
 and I also used Neon's content to heal during my breaks. 

458
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:42,350
 Especially Neon Webtoon, while I was in the hospital during my long recovery, 

459
00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:44,480
 it truly brought me comfort. 

460
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:47,250
 Neon's webtoon characters are mostly optimistic 

461
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:49,550
 and have healthy energy. 

462
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:52,090
 They provided me with strength while I was reading them. 

463
00:33:52,090 --> 00:33:53,670
I also want to share

464
00:33:53,670 --> 00:33:56,580
positive energy and happiness.

465
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:59,550
I also want to create similar content.

466
00:33:59,550 --> 00:34:02,670
That's why I applied to Neon.

467
00:34:02,670 --> 00:34:04,960
You mentioned you use our service.

468
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:08,920
What would you do to enhance growth hacking for Neon services?

469
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,700
What kind of data would you utilize 
Hacking? Illegal?

470
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:12,470
and approach the scenario? 
A b-bad guy?

471
00:34:12,470 --> 00:34:14,250
 He wants me to approach this illegally, right? 

472
00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:16,030
Hacking...
  He wants me to approach this illegally, right? 

473
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:16,990
Yes... 
 What the heck, hacking! 

474
00:34:16,990 --> 00:34:19,660
I've never hacked before, but 
  What the heck, hacking! 

475
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:21,400
if I have to do it, services mo

476
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,220
then I'm ready to learn

477
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:25,030
and I'll do my best...

478
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:27,920
 TN: Growth hacking -- a marketing technique where goods and services are constantly monitored and altered for growth. 

479
00:34:29,450 --> 00:34:30,860
Oh, yes, yes...

480
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:33,440
This is not what you meant.

481
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:36,050
You have to wait for the results.

482
00:34:36,050 --> 00:34:39,960
Ma Eum, you always lose when you are winning

483
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:44,650
and win when you have no hope. You have such strange luck.

484
00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:49,120
If you don't make it, like Dad said before,

485
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:53,180
just think that judo is your destiny.

486
00:34:53,180 --> 00:34:56,100
That'll put you at peace.

487
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:01,010
Lower? Here?

488
00:35:01,010 --> 00:35:02,130
Yeah, there. Around there.

489
00:35:02,130 --> 00:35:03,490
- Around here?
 - That's right.

490
00:35:03,490 --> 00:35:04,730
Horizontal or vertical?

491
00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:06,350
Hurry up and just put it on how ever.

492
00:35:06,350 --> 00:35:08,930
- Horizontal, got it.
 - Aigoo...

493
00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:13,550
So, why were you so reckless?

494
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:15,810
Not thinking of your age!

495
00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:18,740
I was just curious

496
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:21,800
about how instinctively and how much like an animal she would react.

497
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:27,850
Hyung, you tend to over idolize people who are artistic or athletic.

498
00:35:27,850 --> 00:35:29,960
I'm not idolizing art or athleticism.

499
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:33,280
I respect people who push themselves to their limit.

500
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,450
- All the way, huh?
 - But how did you know?

501
00:35:35,450 --> 00:35:36,430
That she did judo?

502
00:35:36,430 --> 00:35:37,270
I just guessed.

503
00:35:37,270 --> 00:35:39,360
- Out of all those sports?
 - Yes.

504
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:41,820
People who are meant to make it, make it.

505
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,650
Amazing.

506
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:51,510
So...

507
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:55,340
Do you think she'll get in? On ...

508
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:58,300
- That judo athlete?
 - Who knows?

509
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:00,960
She doesn't have a resume to impress other judges.

510
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,850
I gave her a perfect score, though.

511
00:36:02,850 --> 00:36:04,300
You put too much of your personal interest in it.

512
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:05,420
Yes, it's my personal interest.

513
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:07,990
She talked about Ginger Toon.

514
00:36:09,770 --> 00:36:13,990
Out of webtoons by Neon, which one do you like the most?

515
00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:18,450
My favorite is Gumiho Princess.

516
00:36:18,450 --> 00:36:22,200
It's my favorite one I've been reading every week, even when it was with Ginger Toon.

517
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:25,460
The main character San Ha is my role model.

518
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:29,120
Is there anything that you regret in your life?

519
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:31,580
What would that be?

520
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:38,150
It would be enduring so much.

521
00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:41,820
In order to achieve my goal of competing in the Olympics and smiling at the end,

522
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:43,990
I just kept enduring no matter what.

523
00:36:43,990 --> 00:36:45,680
I regret that part the most.

524
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:49,060
So if you get hired,

525
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:51,800
are you saying you won't persevere more?

526
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,490
No, no no.

527
00:36:53,490 --> 00:36:56,310
Of course, I will continue to endure and persevere.

528
00:36:56,310 --> 00:36:59,430
It's also my greatest strength.

529
00:36:59,430 --> 00:37:04,410
But now, instead of smiling at the very end,

530
00:37:04,410 --> 00:37:08,390
I think smiling more throughout my life is living well.

531
00:37:08,390 --> 00:37:13,170
I am working to smile a lot and lead a happy life.

532
00:37:16,570 --> 00:37:21,600
If she joins our team, don't you think she'll work really well?

533
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:25,430
But for now,

534
00:37:26,450 --> 00:37:29,320
we need a producer with more experience.

535
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:33,630
A new hire can't replace PD Jeong. You know that, Hyung.

536
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:36,440
You can share experiences and skills can be taught.

537
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:39,850
But passion can't be taught.

538
00:37:39,850 --> 00:37:43,260
Judo girl has an innate passion.

539
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:45,070
She's worth investing in.

540
00:37:45,070 --> 00:37:47,590
Do we have that kind of luxury right now?

541
00:37:47,590 --> 00:37:50,710
- Objectively speaking?
 - Objectively?

542
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:29,900
 You did not pass the final interview for the 2022 Neon New Employee Recruitment 

543
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:34,670
 3 months later 

544
00:38:34,670 --> 00:38:36,690
Jun Yeong!

545
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:41,450
I said I can take you out.

546
00:38:41,450 --> 00:38:43,410
The company cafeteria is of good quality too.

547
00:38:43,410 --> 00:38:45,780
Thank you for making time.

548
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:48,590
So, what do you want to know?

549
00:38:50,130 --> 00:38:52,400
Team allocation?

550
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:55,640
You did your training in the company service planning team, right?

551
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:58,180
- Which team do you want to join?
- Of course, the one I'm in.

552
00:38:58,180 --> 00:39:01,960
The service planning team is the heart and soul of an IT company.

553
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:05,260
I don't think there's an opening there.

554
00:39:05,950 --> 00:39:08,650
Your internal evaluation is great, unlike a new hire.

555
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:11,320
It says you have insight and you work hard.

556
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:13,780
If I don't get assigned to the service planning team,

557
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:16,560
which team would be good for me?

558
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:17,810
All departments are good.

559
00:39:17,810 --> 00:39:19,330
The search engine service, which is key to our business, is great too.

560
00:39:19,330 --> 00:39:20,600
The shopping department is on the rise too.

561
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:21,990
All the content teams are good too.

562
00:39:21,990 --> 00:39:24,570
Music, video, game, you know...

563
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:27,430
Except for one thing.

564
00:39:27,430 --> 00:39:28,770
Which one?

565
00:39:28,770 --> 00:39:30,160
Webtoon Service Team.

566
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,270
Especially the editing department.

567
00:39:31,270 --> 00:39:34,260
They are not on the rankings.

568
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:36,320
Ranking?

569
00:39:47,730 --> 00:39:48,600
 2021 Sales Ratio 

570
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:49,690
 2021 Performance Report 

571
00:39:49,690 --> 00:39:55,020
 1. Game 2. Shopping 3. Search Engine 4. Music 5. Travel 6. Beauty 7. Movies 8. VOD 9. Kids 10. Webtoon 

572
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:00,650
Well...

573
00:40:00,650 --> 00:40:01,830
It's roughly like this.

574
00:40:01,830 --> 00:40:06,450
All the teams are performing their numbers according to our plan.

575
00:40:06,450 --> 00:40:08,510
But Webtoon Service Team...

576
00:40:08,510 --> 00:40:09,460
Yes.

577
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:14,960
It's about time to slowly think about sales, don't you think?

578
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,380
Of course, we should.

579
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:19,990
Team Leader Jang Man Cheol.

580
00:40:19,990 --> 00:40:22,410
It's been three years with us, right?

581
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,870
- Yes. 
 - I understand that you remember

582
00:40:25,870 --> 00:40:28,570
your promise from then.

583
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:34,350
In the current situation, do you think you can keep that promise?

584
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:38,380
Even if you are a late bloomer,

585
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:43,120
getting pushed out by Young Toon and Papaya is hurting my self-esteem.

586
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:45,870
We are still a large-scale portal.

587
00:40:45,870 --> 00:40:48,930
Let me know if you need more investment.

588
00:40:48,930 --> 00:40:52,200
I will help you in every way I can.

589
00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:55,060
Thank you very much.

590
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:06,780
You need additional staff?

591
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:07,840
Yes.

592
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,650
One new hire will join your team.

593
00:41:09,650 --> 00:41:15,480
A newly-hired PD will not be able to make up for an experienced PD.

594
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:18,290
Was it a maternity leave?

595
00:41:18,290 --> 00:41:19,870
Then...

596
00:41:19,870 --> 00:41:22,010
the number of staff members becomes a little vague when she returns.

597
00:41:22,010 --> 00:41:24,240
But from my position, even one more PD would—

598
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:26,310
Again, again, again.

599
00:41:26,310 --> 00:41:29,930
Team Leader Jang Man Cheol, how come you haven't changed since your Ginger Toon days?

600
00:41:29,930 --> 00:41:33,070
You don't think about efficiency but only think about hiring.

601
00:41:33,070 --> 00:41:36,700
That must change.

602
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:40,290
Well, people don't change easily, right?

603
00:41:40,290 --> 00:41:45,150
Me and you, both.

604
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:53,410
I'll carry it.

605
00:41:53,410 --> 00:41:55,270
I'm leaving now.

606
00:41:56,050 --> 00:41:57,790
Hey, Ma Eum.

607
00:41:57,790 --> 00:41:58,750
What?

608
00:41:58,750 --> 00:42:01,430
- Why, why?
 - What's wrong with you? Move.

609
00:42:01,430 --> 00:42:06,160
You'll start training at my school starting next month. Okay?

610
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:08,360
Is field training ending next month?

611
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:10,400
Yes, that's right. You and me, both.

612
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,300
We are both making a comeback.

613
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:13,680
Oh, my. You're running late.

614
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:15,690
- Have a safe trip, Honey. Be careful. 
- Hey, hey.

615
00:42:15,690 --> 00:42:17,250
This is heavy!

616
00:42:17,250 --> 00:42:20,810
Keep challenging yourself and get back in shape!

617
00:42:20,810 --> 00:42:22,560
I'll get back in shape myself.

618
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:24,000
- Go now.
 - You'll get back in shape?

619
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,980
Have a safe trip!

620
00:42:36,090 --> 00:42:38,870
How long are you going to stay like this?

621
00:42:38,870 --> 00:42:41,460
I can't cover for you any longer.

622
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:44,600
So, pull yourself together and do something before your dad comes back.

623
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:47,070
I will.

624
00:42:47,070 --> 00:42:51,420
I'm just momentarily feeling depressed, that's all.

625
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:54,930
Gosh! I finally found something I wanted to do.

626
00:42:54,930 --> 00:42:56,670
But after failing like that, I'm at a loss.

627
00:42:56,670 --> 00:43:00,030
Well, Neon isn't the only webtoon company.

628
00:43:00,030 --> 00:43:02,760
- There's Papaya.
 - I got rejected.

629
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:05,980
- There's Young Toon too. 
- I got rejected.

630
00:43:05,980 --> 00:43:07,970
Really?

631
00:43:07,970 --> 00:43:10,100
You tried your best.

632
00:43:12,310 --> 00:43:16,250
You don't regret giving up judo?

633
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:26,180
Hello?

634
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:29,390
Yes, hello.

635
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:34,750
Yes.

636
00:43:35,620 --> 00:43:37,670
Thank you.

637
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:42,480
Oh, my gosh!

638
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:44,780
I got hired

639
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:57,710
Accepted!

640
00:43:57,710 --> 00:43:59,350
Accepted!

641

651
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:02,730
Hello.

652
00:45:02,730 --> 00:45:06,100
Hello, on which floor is Webtoon Service Team?

653
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:08,780
Webtoon...

654
00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:10,270
That team is not located here.

655
00:45:10,270 --> 00:45:11,180
Pardon?

656
00:45:11,180 --> 00:45:13,210
Webtoon Team is over there.

657
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:14,290
On the other side.

658
00:45:14,290 --> 00:45:16,750
♫  Couldn't I be your strength?  ♫

659
00:45:16,750 --> 00:45:17,980
- Thank you.
 - Sure.

661
00:45:20,820 --> 00:45:24,000
♫  Couldn't we see it again? The child I longed for.  ♫

665
00:45:35,660 --> 00:45:37,290
What?

666
00:45:37,290 --> 00:45:38,730
Hello!

667
00:45:38,730 --> 00:45:40,200
You got in!

668
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:42,450
Oh, yes. Hello.

669
00:45:42,450 --> 00:45:44,370
I knew you would make it.

670
00:45:44,370 --> 00:45:47,220

00:46:29,250 --> 00:46:31,620
 The door is closing. 

682
00:46:57,080 --> 00:46:59,420
Why are you following me?

683
00:47:00,140 --> 00:47:01,840
Oh, me?

684
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:04,800
I came to the Webtoon Service Team.

685
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:07,860
Today's my first day of work there.

686
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:11,260
How about you, Gu Jun Yeong?
  Gu Jun Yeong 

687
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:15,830
 I've never hacked before... 

688
00:47:15,830 --> 00:47:17,340
 Oh, yes, yes... 

689
00:47:17,340 --> 00:47:19,970
 This is not what you meant. 

690
00:47:20,580 --> 00:47:23,060
Okay, those newly assigned to our editing team.

691
00:47:23,060 --> 00:47:25,060
A new hire, Gu Jun Yeong.

692
00:47:25,060 --> 00:47:28,030
And On Ma Eum.

693
00:47:30,610 --> 00:47:32,950
- Good to meet you. 
- Hello.

694
00:47:32,950 --> 00:47:34,840
I'm Gu Jun Yeong.

695
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:38,640
That's it?

696
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:40,950
I'll do my best.

697
00:47:40,950 --> 00:47:43,630
Okay, he said he'll do his best.

698
00:47:43,630 --> 00:47:45,230
Next?

699
00:47:45,230 --> 00:47:48,040
Hello, I'm On Ma Eum.

700
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:49,720
Even though I'm contracted for a year,

701
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:51,900
I'll try my best not to bother the team and to help you.

702
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:54,240
Just like my name, I'll give it all from the bottom of my heart.  (Ma Eum means heart.) 

703
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:56,080
Thank you!

704
00:47:57,610 --> 00:47:58,950
Great!

705
00:47:58,950 --> 00:48:04,720
Okay, Gu Jun Yeong is the best new hire out of all the new hires.

706
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:06,610
They sent a special recruit to our team.

707
00:48:06,610 --> 00:48:09,660
And On Ma Eum is...

708
00:48:10,730 --> 00:48:13,290
Hire a contractor.

709
00:48:13,290 --> 00:48:15,600
- One-year contractor.
 - What?

710
00:48:17,750 --> 00:48:19,250
 Okay. 

711
00:48:19,830 --> 00:48:24,500
I submitted a special request to the company so she can work in our department.

712
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:28,160
She is a very special talent who signed the contract.

713
00:48:28,820 --> 00:48:31,380
That means our upcoming year is very important.

714
00:48:31,380 --> 00:48:34,670
So, seonbae-nims (seniors), help out the hoobaes (juniors) here so they adjust well.

715
00:48:34,670 --> 00:48:38,210
And hoobae-nims, follow your seonbae-nims and work hard to learn.

716
00:48:38,210 --> 00:48:39,570
Yes, sir!

717
00:48:39,570 --> 00:48:40,680
Gu Jun Yeong.

718
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:42,710
Change your ID badge. It's our team badge.

719
00:48:42,710 --> 00:48:44,820
And On Ma Eum.

720
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:56,970
It even smells nice.

721
00:48:56,970 --> 00:48:59,430
- You like it?
 - Yes.

722
00:48:59,430 --> 00:49:03,120
I'll do my best not to let anyone down!

723
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:05,540
I know I picked well.

724
00:49:05,540 --> 00:49:07,810
Get back to work.

725
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:15,630
For now, you can follow me, On Ma Eum.

726
00:49:15,630 --> 00:49:17,590
Gu Jun Yeong, you can...

727
00:49:17,590 --> 00:49:19,600
Oh, PD Kwon Yeong Bae.

728
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:21,920
You can follow him.

729
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:25,420
Come follow me.

730
00:49:26,210 --> 00:49:29,550
And PD Gi Yu Mi and PD Choi Du Hui...

731
00:49:29,550 --> 00:49:31,510
Please cover for us when we are out.

732
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:33,640
I have to go to the meeting with the editor.

733
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:36,820
- Starting from now. Okay? 
- Okay.

734
00:49:36,820 --> 00:49:40,230
 Gu Jun Yeong 

735
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:48,080
No one in that team was hired as a Neon employee.

736
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:49,510
There was a company called Ginger Toon.

737
00:49:49,510 --> 00:49:51,180
Their service got terminated a few years ago.

738
00:49:51,180 --> 00:49:54,680
I heard we brought in an entire webtoon editorial team that was about to get kicked to the curb.

739
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:57,600
Since they started out late, they're far behind Papaya or Young Toon.

740
00:49:57,600 --> 00:49:58,910
They are using all their budget, but

741
00:49:58,910 --> 00:50:03,450
their traffic and sales are too low compared to other teams in the company.

742
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:06,330
It's already been three years now, and they need to perform.

743
00:50:06,330 --> 00:50:08,500
And if that doesn't happen?

744
00:50:09,750 --> 00:50:11,150
Then...

745
00:50:11,150 --> 00:50:13,910
- The new hire who goes there is...
- Totally...

746
00:50:13,910 --> 00:50:16,210
stepping in a pile of sh*t.

747
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:21,500
What should I do?

748
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:23,730
What can you do?

749
00:50:23,730 --> 00:50:25,810
During training, I have experience making

750
00:50:25,810 --> 00:50:27,750
service improvement plans in the service planning team.

751
00:50:27,750 --> 00:50:29,580
Oh, I see.

752
00:50:29,580 --> 00:50:32,320
So, what did you come up with for the webtoon improvement plan?

753
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:35,870
I did not work on improvement plans for webtoons.

754
00:50:35,870 --> 00:50:38,510
Do you even read webtoons?

755
00:50:39,590 --> 00:50:41,420
Okay, okay.

756
00:50:41,420 --> 00:50:44,520
Then,

757
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:48,170
read through all of our lineups.

758
00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:49,640
Okay.

759
00:50:58,190 --> 00:50:59,070
Place your hand above the sensor!

760
00:51:10,550 --> 00:51:12,670
Thank you for this food!

761
00:51:12,670 --> 00:51:14,280
Can you eat all that?

762
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:16,170
Of course.

763
00:51:16,890 --> 00:51:20,650
PD Du Hui, lucky you. You have a friend to go try out foodie places with.

764
00:51:20,650 --> 00:51:24,140
You know that sunbaes don't buy food for hoobaes these days, right?

765
00:51:24,140 --> 00:51:26,790
Other than using a company card, we're strictly going Dutch.

766
00:51:26,790 --> 00:51:28,420
Yes, sir.

767
00:51:35,390 --> 00:51:38,410
Aren't you curious about what we do?

768
00:51:38,410 --> 00:51:39,780
Yes.

769
00:51:39,780 --> 00:51:42,280
Planning items, coordinating artists,

770
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:43,580
producing projects,

771
00:51:43,580 --> 00:51:47,010
artists' mental and lifestyle care?

772
00:51:47,010 --> 00:51:48,580
We do quite a lot.

773
00:51:48,580 --> 00:51:50,350
But for new hires, forget everything else.

774
00:51:50,350 --> 00:51:53,040
You just need to do one thing well.

775
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:55,420
Managing artists' schedules.

776
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:57,220
Managing schedules?

777
00:51:57,220 --> 00:51:59,060
Meeting deadlines.

778
00:51:59,060 --> 00:52:00,810
When an episode misses a deadline,

779
00:52:00,810 --> 00:52:05,040
the butterfly effect on the platform can be tremendous.

780
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:07,390
I'm so sorry. Yes.

781
00:52:07,390 --> 00:52:09,450
I'm really sorry.

782
00:52:09,450 --> 00:52:10,730
Because we missed deadlines,

783
00:52:10,730 --> 00:52:13,450
we have to pay back the cost for PPL and advertisements.

784
00:52:13,450 --> 00:52:16,440
They're going crazy.

785
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:19,780
 The ad sales for the episode became negative instantly. 

786
00:52:19,780 --> 00:52:24,870
 The viewers lost trust in our platform and went to a different platform. 

787
00:52:24,870 --> 00:52:29,010
 Once the viewers leave, they never come back. 

788
00:52:29,740 --> 00:52:33,530
 Even though they may be negative, more than a thousand comments shrivel down to a hundred 

789
00:52:33,530 --> 00:52:35,120
 and eventually, no comments. 

790
00:52:35,120 --> 00:52:36,440
 Empty 

791
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:39,390
When the butterfly effect enlarges,

792
00:52:39,390 --> 00:52:41,590
in the worst-case scenario...

793
00:52:42,450 --> 00:52:43,320
 Deputy Editor Seok Ji Hyeong 

794
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:44,750
Pick up your phone.

795
00:52:44,750 --> 00:52:47,390
Aigoo! Okay.

796
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:50,420
Yes, Deputy Editor.

797
00:52:53,150 --> 00:52:55,780
Meeting with artists?

798
00:52:55,780 --> 00:52:58,070
They told me to ask Deputy Editor.

799
00:52:58,070 --> 00:53:01,650
What is the result of the butterfly effect of missing the deadline for a series?

800
00:53:03,590 --> 00:53:05,530
I told them to talk to you a bit.

801
00:53:05,530 --> 00:53:08,740
They told you all kinds of things on your first day at work.

802
00:53:10,190 --> 00:53:14,240
But honestly, that is the most important thing.

803
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:15,940
So what happens?

804
00:53:15,940 --> 00:53:18,640
The service was terminated.

805
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:20,600
What?

806
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:21,690
They went under.

807
00:53:21,690 --> 00:53:25,810
What?
  Series missing deadlines -&gt; Service terminated? 

808
00:53:46,840 --> 00:53:48,990
Meeting with artist Baek Eo Jin!

809
00:53:48,990 --> 00:53:50,940
Whoa, I'm so nervous!

810
00:53:50,940 --> 00:53:53,420
I was a huge fan of the Dragon's Dream.

811
00:53:53,420 --> 00:53:55,500
This is work and not a fan meeting.

812
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:57,530
Don't get carried away.

813
00:53:57,530 --> 00:54:01,070
On Ma Eum, now you are not a webtoon fan.

814
00:54:01,070 --> 00:54:03,020
You are a webtoon PD. Got it?

815
00:54:03,020 --> 00:54:04,030
Yes, sir.

816
00:54:04,030 --> 00:54:06,400
Besides, we don't meet with artists often these days.

817
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:08,430
We all communicate online.

818
00:54:08,430 --> 00:54:12,960
But Artist Baek Eo Jin likes to meet in person and discuss.

819
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:14,020
And what was it?

820
00:54:14,020 --> 00:54:18,070
The former PD went on maternity leave, so there's been a change as well.

821
00:54:20,820 --> 00:54:23,330
So, by chance, is that me?

822
00:54:24,630 --> 00:54:27,390
No, it's me.

823
00:54:32,900 --> 00:54:37,320
Editor said that he saw something in you.

824
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:40,890
But I have no idea what he's talking about.

825
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:43,760
So, show me from now on.

826
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:45,700
That I'm wrong about you.

827
00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:47,230
Yes, sir!

828
00:54:47,230 --> 00:54:49,880
Okay, let's do this.

829
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:51,540
Yes, sir!

830
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:59,710
What kind of person is Artist Baek Eo Jin?

831
00:54:59,710 --> 00:55:01,340
In one word,

832
00:55:02,940 --> 00:55:05,160
he's a master.

833
00:55:09,670 --> 00:55:11,420
 Since his comic magazine days, 

834
00:55:11,420 --> 00:55:15,460
 he's famous for submitting high-quality manuscripts weeks before deadline. 

835
00:55:21,300 --> 00:55:25,020
So this is something I've never used.

836
00:55:25,020 --> 00:55:27,930
You can see all the work you did here.

837
00:55:27,930 --> 00:55:29,700
This is amazing.

838
00:55:29,700 --> 00:55:31,800
And he has an amazing personality.

839
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:36,650
He's even very diligent and trustworthy as well. The highest quality in a talent.

840
00:55:36,650 --> 00:55:39,320
There's a reason why he's been in it for the long run.

841
00:55:43,190 --> 00:55:45,140
Oh, yes, ma'am.

842
00:56:00,110 --> 00:56:01,400
 Tap, tap, tap 

843
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:03,820
 Swoosh! 

844
00:56:03,820 --> 00:56:05,360
 Scholar Gu! 

845
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:06,390
 My Lady Hui! 

846
00:56:06,390 --> 00:56:09,130
 How did you get here, My Lady? 

847
00:56:50,930 --> 00:56:54,700
I like the smell of paper and ink.

848
00:56:54,700 --> 00:56:57,310
You don't smell that in other studios.

849
00:56:57,310 --> 00:56:59,720
Since everyone uses tablets these days.

850
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:03,060
I also tried it, but it was very difficult.

851
00:57:03,060 --> 00:57:07,420
But my assistants do the digital work for me.

852
00:57:09,270 --> 00:57:12,520
Those are very old.

853
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:16,780
All of them were used since the Dragon's Eyes days.

854
00:57:17,940 --> 00:57:21,560
Publishing one series for over 30 years

855
00:57:21,560 --> 00:57:23,780
is really amazing.

856
00:57:24,790 --> 00:57:27,240
So you were a candidate for a judo national athlete?

857
00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:28,090
Yes.

858
00:57:28,090 --> 00:57:30,360
That seems more amazing to me.

859
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:32,540
Gosh, no, no.

860
00:57:32,540 --> 00:57:34,500
On the day of the interview,

861
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:38,190
she threw our editor to the ground.

862
00:57:39,660 --> 00:57:44,010
- But of course, our editor was at fault.
 - Yes.

863
00:57:44,010 --> 00:57:47,750
Please throw me down onto the ground sometime.

864
00:57:47,750 --> 00:57:50,070
I'm curious what that feels like.

865
00:57:50,070 --> 00:57:51,920
Would it wake me up?

866
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:53,840
Absolutely, I can show you anytime you want.

867
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:57,920
But a hard floor can hurt a little bit.

868
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:00,860
He's joking.

869
00:58:00,860 --> 00:58:02,980
Gosh, I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

870
00:58:02,980 --> 00:58:05,300
No, it's okay. You are funny.

871
00:58:05,300 --> 00:58:07,540
- Yes.
 - My goodness...

872
00:58:09,890 --> 00:58:12,310
Is there anything you want to ask me?

873
00:58:12,310 --> 00:58:14,700
I have so many questions, but...

874
00:58:18,050 --> 00:58:19,660
as a fan,

875
00:58:19,660 --> 00:58:21,760
how is your health?

876
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:25,090
Are you healthy? That is my concern.

877
00:58:26,350 --> 00:58:29,080
My physical strength is still good.

878
00:58:29,080 --> 00:58:30,850
But I fear

879
00:58:30,850 --> 00:58:34,620
my imagination will run out before that does.

880
00:58:34,620 --> 00:58:38,640
I only need enough physical strength to sit and hold pencils.

881
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:40,710
Don't you think so?

882
00:58:42,630 --> 00:58:44,950
Gosh, no.

883
00:58:52,080 --> 00:58:54,780
The background ratio looks odd on the file you gave me earlier.

884
00:58:54,780 --> 00:58:56,680
Who would even know?

885
00:58:56,680 --> 00:58:58,670
Aren't you being too sloppy lately?

886
00:58:58,670 --> 00:59:00,770
How did you know?

887
00:59:01,630 --> 00:59:04,310
I'm going to quit soon.

888
00:59:04,310 --> 00:59:05,360
What?

889
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:07,390
Sinsang Platform contacted me

890
00:59:07,390 --> 00:59:11,670
after seeing my work on Webtoon Audition.

891
00:59:11,670 --> 00:59:15,020
But you should complete the work you were doing before you leave.

892
00:59:15,020 --> 00:59:16,700
Are you pissed?

893
00:59:16,700 --> 00:59:19,690
Because I'm becoming successful before you, Hyeong?

894
00:59:22,980 --> 00:59:24,830
Then, we'll get going now.

895
00:59:24,830 --> 00:59:27,640
We'll visit you again soon.

896
00:59:28,370 --> 00:59:29,400
It was nice to meet you.

897
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:31,260
I enjoyed my time here so much.

898
00:59:31,260 --> 00:59:33,010
I've become an even bigger fan.

899
00:59:33,010 --> 00:59:36,090
I'll leave long comments on your webtoons going forward.

900
00:59:36,090 --> 00:59:38,340
So please read them.

901
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,100
C-Comments?

902
00:59:41,850 --> 00:59:44,520
Okay, I will definitely read it.

903
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:47,380
Please read them.

904
00:59:53,060 --> 00:59:54,270
Hey.

905
00:59:54,270 --> 00:59:58,310
Do you think a webtoon PD can leave comments open to the public?

906
00:59:58,310 --> 00:59:59,970
Gosh, I forgot my role again.

907
00:59:59,970 --> 01:00:03,250
Artist Baek Eo Jin doesn't read comments online.

908
01:00:03,250 --> 01:00:04,500
Why not?

909
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:06,660
I guess his former PD told him not to read them.

910
01:00:06,660 --> 01:00:10,750
Because he can get hurt or lose focus.

911
01:00:10,750 --> 01:00:12,600
How about feedback from his readers?

912
01:00:12,700 --> 01:00:15,100
His PD checked them beforehand

913
01:00:15,100 --> 01:00:17,370
and told him during the meetings.

914
01:00:20,350 --> 01:00:21,970
Why?

915
01:00:21,970 --> 01:00:23,300
Are you disappointed?

916
01:00:23,300 --> 01:00:25,520
No, I just think...

917
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:29,220
I mean, the greatest benefit of webtoon is

918
01:00:29,220 --> 01:00:32,530
having direct communication with the readers.

919
01:00:32,530 --> 01:00:34,470
Of course, vicious comments are inevitable, but

920
01:00:34,470 --> 01:00:38,850
if he reads warmhearted comments from his fans,

921
01:00:38,850 --> 01:00:43,090
I'm sure he will gain a lot of good energy from it.

922
01:00:43,090 --> 01:00:46,350
It feels like a waste to let that go.

923
01:00:46,350 --> 01:00:48,300
I think it's a shame.

924
01:00:48,300 --> 01:00:49,450
I see.

925
01:00:49,450 --> 01:00:50,590
So what now?

926
01:00:50,590 --> 01:00:53,160
You are going to teach the master?

927
01:00:53,160 --> 01:00:55,340
You're kind of arrogant.

928
01:00:56,030 --> 01:00:57,750
I'm sorry.

929
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:03,300
But, you're not totally wrong.

930
01:01:05,350 --> 01:01:07,960
- Anyway.
 - Yes?

931
01:01:08,810 --> 01:01:10,470
Where did I park my car?

932
01:01:10,470 --> 01:01:13,460
You parked in front of Artist Baek's house.

933
01:01:15,530 --> 01:01:17,190
Let's go.

934
01:01:18,410 --> 01:01:20,080
Let's go to the next artist's house.

935
01:01:20,080 --> 01:01:21,440
Yes, sir.

936
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:22,410
 Swoosh 

937
01:01:22,410 --> 01:01:24,530
 We finally meet. 

938
01:01:24,530 --> 01:01:26,550
 Open, Hmph 

939
01:01:26,550 --> 01:01:30,100
 I knew it. It's you again. 

940
01:01:30,100 --> 01:01:32,700
Aigoo, hello.

941
01:01:33,580 --> 01:01:36,090
This is On Ma Eum, a new hire.

942
01:01:36,090 --> 01:01:38,210
Hello.

943
01:01:44,900 --> 01:01:47,080
- The security, right?
 - Yes, yes, yes!

944
01:01:47,080 --> 01:01:48,150
Hello!

945
01:01:48,150 --> 01:01:51,340
- I'm On Ma Eum. Nice to meet you. 
- Okay, please sit.

946
01:01:51,340 --> 01:01:53,670
- Sit.
 - Okay.

947
01:01:54,500 --> 01:01:58,600
Wow. What a coincidence.

948
01:01:58,600 --> 01:02:01,040
Did you really become a webtoon PD to meet me?

949
01:02:01,040 --> 01:02:03,540
You can pretty much say that.

950
01:02:06,150 --> 01:02:08,770
He's joking too.

951
01:02:08,770 --> 01:02:10,690
I'm not kidding.

952
01:02:12,190 --> 01:02:14,140
I'm a popular, handsome man.

953
01:02:15,620 --> 01:02:18,430
It's truly an honor to meet you again.

954
01:02:18,430 --> 01:02:20,490
On Ma Eum.

955
01:02:20,490 --> 01:02:22,410
Man Du (dumpling).

956
01:02:22,410 --> 01:02:24,420
On Man Du.

957
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:27,920
Jjim Man Du (steamed dumplings).

958
01:02:27,930 --> 01:02:30,740
 TN: The Korean term for "cauliflower ears" is mandu (dumpling) ears. 

959
01:02:30,740 --> 01:02:32,890
Jjim Man Du.

960
01:02:32,890 --> 01:02:34,830
Oh, my gosh.

961
01:02:40,170 --> 01:02:42,790
Why is it so hot? Is it going to take long?

962
01:02:42,790 --> 01:02:44,960
Yeah, it'll be over soon.

963
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:46,970
I asked you not to come out during the meeting.

964
01:02:46,970 --> 01:02:49,150
Hello.

965
01:02:50,270 --> 01:02:51,610
Come on now.

966
01:02:51,610 --> 01:02:54,100
- What's with you?
 - Aigoo. You'll be cold.

967
01:02:54,100 --> 01:02:55,850
She's an influencer.

968
01:02:55,850 --> 01:02:58,120
I hear she has several hundred thousand followers online.

969
01:02:58,120 --> 01:02:59,820
Gosh, no wonder!

970
01:02:59,820 --> 01:03:02,320
She was so pretty.

971
01:03:04,020 --> 01:03:05,950
She's a troublemaker.

972
01:03:05,950 --> 01:03:08,850
- Why?
 - She ghosts him as much as possible.

973
01:03:08,850 --> 01:03:11,410
Whenever that happens, Na Gang Nam's work all stops.

974
01:03:11,410 --> 01:03:12,410
All stop?

975
01:03:12,410 --> 01:03:15,430
It's a quarterly event, pretty much.

976
01:03:16,670 --> 01:03:20,620
The only person who never misses the deadline without any trouble is

977
01:03:20,620 --> 01:03:23,310
Artist Baek Eo Jin.

978
01:03:24,120 --> 01:03:26,460
He's amazing.

979
01:03:26,460 --> 01:03:30,900
 Newbie of the Year Award 

980
01:03:37,560 --> 01:03:41,980
It seems a little heavy, but you did a good job organizing.

981
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:47,790
Rather than beginning too gravely, try to get people interested more.

982
01:03:47,790 --> 01:03:51,710
Starting by arranging interesting stories isn't a bad idea.

983
01:03:51,710 --> 01:03:56,090
Ultimately, we have to adjust to the readers' perspectives.

984
01:03:57,380 --> 01:03:59,740
Thank you for your advice, sir.

985
01:03:59,740 --> 01:04:02,080
I'll try revising again.

986
01:04:02,080 --> 01:04:06,500
Did Kyeong Sik leave for the day?

987
01:04:06,500 --> 01:04:10,010
It's been a while since he showed me his work.

988
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:13,750
Ah, that is because...

989
01:04:31,710 --> 01:04:33,000
There are many places I want to go!

990
01:04:33,010 --> 01:04:34,440
Where shall I leave to now?

991
01:04:37,730 --> 01:04:39,760
 WebToon 

992
01:04:46,850 --> 01:04:49,200
 112th episode? 

993
01:04:49,960 --> 01:04:52,650
 When will I review all this and get off work? 

994
01:04:59,700 --> 01:05:01,070
What is it?

995
01:05:01,070 --> 01:05:02,690
Are you leaving already?

996
01:05:02,690 --> 01:05:05,310
- Did you look at everything?
 - No.

997
01:05:05,310 --> 01:05:07,490
It's not that difficult to sit and read webtoons.

998
01:05:07,490 --> 01:05:10,700
You don't have as much persistence as I thought.

999
01:05:11,750 --> 01:05:12,870
I'm leaving.

1000
01:05:12,870 --> 01:05:15,520
- Bye now.
 - Take care.

1001
01:05:32,690 --> 01:05:33,880
 There's no hope. 

1002
01:05:33,880 --> 01:05:36,610
 - His work is hopeless. 
  - Old man's cartoon is out of my list. 

1003
01:05:36,610 --> 01:05:39,930
 Old people should rest at home, please. 

1004
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,090
 How long is this old man going to keep drawing? 

1005
01:05:43,090 --> 01:05:45,050
 He might expire any day now. His work is so boring. 

1006
01:05:45,050 --> 01:05:47,840
 Even Dragon's Dream characters have sagging faces. 

1007
01:05:47,840 --> 01:05:49,040
 Is the chin growing? 

1008
01:05:49,040 --> 01:05:52,040
 Must we listen to old people's nagging even in webtoons? 

1009
01:05:52,040 --> 01:05:54,790
 It was good until the Dragon's Crisis. 

1010
01:05:54,790 --> 01:05:56,300
 He shouldn't have come back. 

1011
01:05:56,300 --> 01:05:59,990
 He only came back to ruin and have an egg on the series' reputation. 

1012
01:06:02,420 --> 01:06:04,120
I mean, this is too much!

1013
01:06:04,120 --> 01:06:07,100
 He is old enough to smear poop on the wall. 

1014
01:06:07,100 --> 01:06:09,720

1017
01:06:20,530 --> 01:06:23,980
 I'll leave long reviews on your webtoons going forward.
 

1018
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:26,500
 So please read them. 

1019
01:06:35,340 --> 01:06:39,110
 People who are writing vicious comments, do you really have nothing better to do? 

1020
01:06:39,110 --> 01:06:43,590
 Do you think a webtoon PD can leave comments open to the public? 

1021
01:06:44,620 --> 01:06:46,540
 Co-Comments? 

1022
01:06:46,540 --> 01:06:50,190
 Okay, I will definitely read it. 

1023
01:06:50,190 --> 01:06:54,050
Gosh, I shouldn't have told him to look at the comments.

1024
01:06:59,510 --> 01:07:02,470
 He shouldn't have come back. He only came back to ruin and have an egg on the series' reputation. 

1025
01:07:02,470 --> 01:07:05,400
  He is old enough to smear poop on the wall...

 Artist Baek Eo Jin 

1028
01:07:33,690 --> 01:07:34,820
Hello, sir.

1029
01:07:34,820 --> 01:07:38,680
How are you? What made you call me at this hour?

1030
01:07:40,830 --> 01:07:43,720
What are you saying?

1031
01:07:43,720 --> 01:07:46,360
Hold on, please, sir. Don't, don't...

1032
01:07:46,360 --> 01:07:49,740
I'll go and visit you at your home right now.

1033
01:07:49,740 --> 01:07:50,800
I'll go and talk...

1034
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:52,120
Hold on! Hold on, please...

1035
01:07:52,120 --> 01:07:53,790
No, Artist Baek Eo Jin!

1036
01:07:53,790 --> 01:07:55,740
Sir!

1037
01:07:56,700 --> 01:07:58,750
Your nose.

1038
01:08:01,540 --> 01:08:03,490
 Emergency! 

1039
01:08:17,280 --> 01:08:20,070
Why isn't he picking up?

1040
01:08:20,070 --> 01:08:23,080
Sir, please hurry up.

1041
01:08:44,530 --> 01:08:46,030
PD Choi, wake up.

1042
01:08:46,030 --> 01:08:47,920
PD Choi, get up! It's an emergency!

1043
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:49,110
Get up!

1044
01:08:49,110 --> 01:08:51,450
Gosh! Why didn't you pick up?

1045
01:08:51,450 --> 01:08:53,260
What's going on?

1046
01:08:57,030 --> 01:08:58,920
What is it suddenly?

1047
01:08:58,920 --> 01:09:01,960
Why did you call everyone in? What's the emergency?

1048
01:09:02,560 --> 01:09:05,790
He called, but I couldn't understand him because he was so riled up.

1049
01:09:10,120 --> 01:09:13,310
 He starts stuttering when he's all riled up. 

1050
01:09:14,750 --> 01:09:16,880
Hey, Seok Ji Hyeong!

1051
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:18,630
What the hell happened?

1052
01:09:18,630 --> 01:09:19,440
What?

1053
01:09:19,440 --> 01:09:23,500
Artist Baek Eo Jin wants all of his manuscripts returned.

1054
01:09:24,130 --> 01:09:25,700
What?

1055
01:09:27,250 --> 01:09:30,590
He wants everything, including all the previews of the paid subscriptions, taken down.

1056
01:09:30,590 --> 01:09:33,710
What did you say to him when you went over there?

1057
01:09:33,710 --> 01:09:41,200


1058
01:09:41,200 --> 01:09:44,550
♫  There isn't anything which can force me ♫

1059
01:09:44,550 --> 01:09:47,580
♫  Don't comfort me that way  ♫

1060
01:09:47,580 --> 01:09:54,150
♫  The crisis faces me now and I feel like everthing will crash  ♫

1061
01:09:54,150 --> 01:09:57,490
♫  Whoa, whoa, whoa, open your eyes  ♫

1062
01:09:57,490 --> 01:10:00,450
♫  Someday you will stand again/  ♫

1063
01:10:00,450 --> 01:10:05,530
♫  Whoa whoa.  Think. I think you will smile brightly.   ♫

 Today's Webtoon 

1065
01:10:09,110 --> 01:10:12,840
 He wouldn't retire like this, would he? 

1066
01:10:12,840 --> 01:10:18,260
 If you stop everything and let it go, what would you have said, On Ma Eum? 

1067
01:10:18,260 --> 01:10:23,230
 I think I just appreciated friends who wandered with me. 

1068
01:10:23,230 --> 01:10:24,240
 Then do we just end the series here? 

1069
01:10:24,240 --> 01:10:25,640
 - Punk! 
- What are you doing? 

1070
01:10:25,640 --> 01:10:28,230
 Have you still not come to your senses yet? 

1071
01:10:28,230 --> 01:10:31,130
 Comments like "be strong" and "do your best." They only drain me when I hear them. 

1072
01:10:31,130 --> 01:10:33,720
 I heard that team may be gone next year. 

1073
01:10:33,720 --> 01:10:37,080
 Then I will resign. 

1074
01:10:37,080 --> 01:10:40,470
♫  Can't I be your strength? Even if I am bearing it now I'm scared  ♫

1075
01:10:40,470 --> 01:10:44,350
♫  Couldn't we return, I wished, to the happy past?  ♫
