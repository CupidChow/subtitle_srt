1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:08,010


2
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:34,030
 Today's Webtoon 

3
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:39,280
 Episode 8: I'll become your unchanging sincerity. 

4
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:42,340
Drink up, drink up.

5
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:45,140
 Self Bar 
 Snacks and watert self-service. 

6
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,920
You're still good at drinking, PD Jang.

7
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,670
No, let me correct that.

8
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:55,150
I need to call you the Deputy Editor now, right?

9
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:56,990
Just call me what's easier for you.

10
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:59,190
What's the use of a title between us?

11
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:00,300
They said it's important.

12
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,590
That it's a really sensitive issue in the corporate world.

13
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:03,950
I'm fine with it.

14
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:05,820
- You know I've always been cool.
 - Right.

15
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:09,440
You're cool. That's why I like Jang Hye Mi, you know? Drink.

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,300
- Welcome.
 - Hello.

17
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:17,690
What's wrong, Deputy Editor?

18
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:24,020
That's... Young Toon's...

19
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:27,630
Ma'am, please give us a bottle of beer.

20
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:29,760
Thank you.

21
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,440
My gosh! I'll pour it for you!

22
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,310
What's Artist Na Gang Nam doing he—

23
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:36,220
Oh, my. You drink well.

24
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:40,590
Why is Artist Na Gang Nam meeting Young Toon's deputy editor?

25
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:47,600
How is Young Toon these days?

26
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,040
We're doing well. The sales are strong.

27
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,640
Subscriber loyalty is quite substantial, too.

28
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,580
Except for this one thing that we're lacking.

29
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:55,610
What's that?

30
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:57,040
What do you think?

31
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,780
You, Artist Na.

32
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:02,630
What? Listen to you. So the Deputy Editor says?

33
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:08,210
Only if you can come to our platform and start a new webtoon,

34
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:10,530
it'd be like placing wings on Young Toon, you know?

35
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:13,990
"Gumiho Princess" is taking up all of my time. How can I start a new project?

36
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:17,650
Didn't you say that you'll end that one soon way back when I was in Ginger Toon?

37
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:19,240
Well. That's right.

38
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,200
Somehow, I ended up still doing it.

39
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,580
Is it your fifth year with that piece already?

40
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:31,930
But didn't you actually want to do a more intense story?

41
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:33,880
Exactly.

42
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:37,850
You see, I'm actually more into those rough and dark stories.

43
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:40,870
But those always get rejected because they're too grave.

44
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:44,500
My first series ever was "Gumiho Princess," which I prepared with Seok Ji Hyeong.

45
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,260
This is, actually...

46
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:48,730
Actually, the complete opposite of my taste.

47
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:51,620
I thought it was the polar opposite, but this one!

48
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:54,180
Who knew it would hit big like this?

49
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:58,980
With your skills, you would've succeeded no matter what.

50
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:00,910
Not because it was "Gumiho Princess."

51
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:02,870
Hey, hey. Just how high do you plan to take me today?

52
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:05,120
I'm getting dizzy, you know.

53
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,330
You're an airplane yourself, so it's fine.

54
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:16,280
Artist Na. If you did that much so far, isn't it enough?

55
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,590
"Gumiho Princess"?

56
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:27,750
Artist Na, I just want you to...

57
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:34,050
draw the webtoon that you wanted to do in the first place.

58
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:42,270
Our Young Toon viewers are also thirsting for an intense, dark story.

59
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:46,830
Those genres that target adults also improve sales.

60
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:51,880
We'll meet your demand, the highest offer in the industry.

61
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:57,050
Since, Artist Na, you're the best in the industry.

62
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:11,220
My goodness, sweetie.

63
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:13,270
You were hungry, huh?

64
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:15,820
Mommy was washing for too long, right?

65
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:17,760
I'll be right back with your food.

66
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:44,290
Do you want this one?

67
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,770
Is it hacking?

68
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:44,380
I took all the primary measures.

69
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:46,550
That's that, but...

70
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:49,220
I also heard camera shutter sounds as if someone was secretly taking pictures of me

71
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:51,400
when I was getting in the car in the parking lot many times.

72
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,530
My packages kept disappearing as well.

73
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:55,260
Let's report to the police first.

74
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:58,770
We could find out who took the packages if we checked the CCTV footage.

75
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:01,290
That person must be the culprit.

76
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:04,580
By chance, do you suspect anyone?

77
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:07,390
Maybe someone who knows your home address.

78
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:09,520
No. No one.

79
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,140
Probably no one besides PD Kwon and you.

80
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:16,020
I only talk about work over text with the assistants, too.

81
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:30,040
 Could it be... PD Kwon who hacked? 

82
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,380
What are you looking at?

83
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:36,030
You got something to say?

84
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:38,770
No, nothing.

85
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:45,180
What's up? You look very tired today.

86
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:47,040
Oh, well that's...

87
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:50,750
I just couldn't sleep well last night.

88
00:06:56,370 --> 00:06:57,810
You're all here.

89
00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:01,070
- Hello.
 - Let's start the meeting.

90
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:04,460
I read all the weekly meeting notes, but there was one issue.

91
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:07,490
Yu Mi, did you place orders for the production of the goods?

92
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:09,610
I ordered from the same place that does Blackpink's goods.

93
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:11,830
- I see.
 - Mics and cushions...

94
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:13,530
Anyway, keep working on it.

95
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:15,830
Turn to the last page now.

96
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:38,250
Dong Hui! This is...

97
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:45,630
Do you need something, sir?

98
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:46,910
Well...

99
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:51,770
It seems that I forgot the undo shortcut again.

100
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:53,040
Oh, okay.

101
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,220
It's not working for some reason.

102
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:58,070
One moment, please.

103
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:02,420
Wh-Why?

104
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:04,990
Um... sir...

105
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:07,220
It looks like it's gone.

106
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:08,220
What?

107
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:09,950
Okay, let's end it here.

108
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:10,910
Okay.

109
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:14,340
- Gear up on those new series preparations, please. 
 - Okay.

110
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:17,210
Young Toon is raking in a bunch of artists these days.

111
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:20,460
Papaya's also on high alert because they lost a few top artists.

112
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:23,570
Those artists are already starting new series next month.

113
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:26,980
All the PDs in charge, please keep a close watch on our artists, so we don't lose them as well.

114
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:29,020
Okay.

115
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:31,380
What's wrong with your reactions?

116
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:33,200
- On Ma Eum.
 - Yes.

117
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,480
You, of all people, shouldn't be like that, you know.

118
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:38,000
- Yes!
 - You're not going to lose Artist Na, right?

119
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,280
Not at all.

120
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,550
O-Okay, sir!

121
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:59,200
Should I pay a visit to Artist Na's studio?

122
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,990
- Why?
 - You know...

123
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:04,500
Even Chief Editor is asking whether we'll lose him.

124
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:07,550
I feel like there must be something I can do if I go there.

125
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:11,460
I already asked him to meet for lunch later.

126
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:13,960
- Then can I go with yo— 
 - Hey.

127
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:20,080
I understand you're anxious, but

128
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:24,430
this is not something we can force on him.

129
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:27,850
It can actually backfire if we rush over together for nothing.

130
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:30,920
So just ease your mind and wait patiently, please,

131
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:33,210
PD On Ma Eum.

132
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:59,890
- It's fine, fine. 
 - Hot today, right?

133
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:02,170
I had to chase a hangover today, you see.

134
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:04,850
And you asked to meet here with perfect timing.

135
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:06,380
What's up, anyway?

136
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:08,450
Well, let's eat first.

137
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:14,040
Actually, I was walking by...

138
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:18,520
and saw you last night.

139
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,370
Really? You should've said hi. Where?

140
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:23,540
You were with Deputy Editor Jang Hye Mi.

141
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:30,660
I didn't bring it up to make you uncomfortable.

142
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:32,560
That's why you asked to meet today, huh?

143
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,210
Whoa, can't believe Seok Ji Hyeong rushed out to meet me like this.

144
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:38,510
Na Gang Nam. I still got it, huh?

145
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:43,470
Why would you say such a sad thing?

146
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:47,460
You're the best of our leading artists at Neon.

147
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:50,890
So?

148
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:52,680
Are you nervous?

149
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:57,100
Yes.

150
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:01,440
But do you really have an interest in going to Young Toon?

151
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,340
I don't know yet. I'm still thinking.

152
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:05,500
Anyhow, it's my freedom to choose where I draw.

153
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:10,720
Even if I go elsewhere, don't be petty and start calling me a traitor and stuff, okay?

154
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:17,230
But you'll continue to work on "Gumiho Princess," right?

155
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:21,180
I'm also thinking about that.

156
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:24,330
As you know, I'm not physically capable of working on two series simultaneously.

157
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:27,750
If I'm to start a new series elsewhere, I've got to

158
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:30,210
start bringing  "Gumiho Princess" to an end.

159
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:36,630
Is the offer from Young Toon much better than what we offer you now?

160
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:39,700
If you tell me, we can match whatever their conditions are.

161
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,890
No, no, no. Not at all.

162
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:44,090
That's not the main issue.

163
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:49,520
I just wonder at times if it's okay to continue drawing

164
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,890
only the stuff like "Gumiho Princess," you know?

165
00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:53,490
Since my debut, this has been my only series.

166
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:55,560
In fact,

167
00:11:55,560 --> 00:12:00,830
what I really wanted to draw was something else, you know.

168
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,800
I'm already 40 years old.

169
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,440
The world changes by the second and

170
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,680
I still have piles of webtoon that I want to draw.

171
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,030
But there's not much time left.

172
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:10,640
Whenever I think about these things...

173
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,920
How should I put it? It just...

174
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,770
It just starts burning deep inside here. Burning hot.

175
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:18,220
- You know what I mean, right? 
 - Of course, I do.

176
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:22,460
If it's about wanting to draw a different webtoon,

177
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:25,170
you could also do it with us again.

178
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:26,990
It's not a good match for Neon.

179
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:29,610
I know the Neon viewers' taste better than you, you know.

180
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:33,530
But the types of webtoons we work with have gotten broader.

181
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:35,310
Also...

182
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:39,330
both PD On Ma Eum and I can help you in every way—

183
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:40,860
Come on now.

184
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,750
Don't say a word to that steamed Mandu about this.

185
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:45,810
If I tell her I'm ending "Gumiho Princess," she'll cry her eyes out.

186
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:48,480
She's a crazy fan of "Gumiho Princess."

187
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:50,800
In any case, this is my problem.

188
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,760
I'll think about it more and decide.

189
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,090
Can I have boiled pork?

190
00:12:54,090 --> 00:12:56,850
- Of course, you can.
 - One boiled pork, please.

191
00:12:58,770 --> 00:13:00,310
Yes...

192
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:07,970
Something's up, huh?

193
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:11,740
- No... 
 - Her face says it all.

194
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:13,220
What's wrong?

195
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:15,440
- N-Nothin— 
- Spill it.

196
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,510
In fact...

197
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:25,030
I accidentally saw Artist Na having a meeting with Young Toon.

198
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:32,500
If he ends "Gumiho Princess" series and  moves over to Young Toon,

199
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:36,070
that's all my fault.

200
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:45,920
Nothing's been decided yet, right?

201
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,280
Also, how is that your fault?

202
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:52,320
Because it happened after I became his PD.

203
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:55,410
Well...

204
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:57,930
Every webtoon has an end, right?

205
00:13:57,930 --> 00:14:01,240
It's not like it's being forced to end due to bad performance.

206
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:05,190
No PD in charge gets blamed for the ending of a webtoon.

207
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:10,950
- What's wrong? 
- I'm that person.

208
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:18,270
- Sorry? 
 - A PD at Neon whose webtoon might be forced to end.

209
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:22,140
Artist Oh Yun's new series has been receiving bad reviews.

210
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:25,630
I should've really stopped "Origin of Mankind."

211
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:31,570
Are you still worried?

212
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:36,160
I can't really help it.

213
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:43,260
I really don't want to let Artist Na go like this.

214
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:45,280
Am I...

215
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,840
Am I being selfish?

216
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:52,330
I'm sure all the readers feel the same way you do.

217
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:56,470
You also need to protect that title as the PD in charge.

218
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:02,050
- Hello, sir.
 - Hello.

219
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:04,320
Hey. What brings you to the headquarters?

220
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,440
We just have a business with the marketing department.

221
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:13,250
What would be the name of this employee next to you, Mr. Gu?

222
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:17,220
My name is On Ma Eum of the Webtoon Service Team.

223
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:20,520
That contractor who got hired as a special recruit.

224
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,370
Yes, sir.

225
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:26,150
Why don't you see me briefly before you go, Mr. Gu?

226
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:27,870
Okay.

227
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:31,470
- Let me through.
 - O-Oh, yes.

228
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:35,780
- I'll leave this to you, then. 
- Okay.

229
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:08,960
Are there any issues lately?

230
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,170
What issues could you be—

231
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:13,390
Like trying to waste money on a useless project

232
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:16,190
or a change in the artist line-up.

233
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:18,810
I'm sure the reports will all come in later anyway,

234
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:21,270
but it'd be good to know in advance.

235
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:24,800
It seems that there could be a loss of a leading artist.

236
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:28,350
- Who?
 - Artist Na Gang Nam.

237
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:32,370
That'll be a problem.

238
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:36,050
What's there to see in Neon Webtoon without Na Gang Nam?

239
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:41,240
There aren't any other changes besides that, are there?

240
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:43,840
No.

241
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:47,480
Okay.

242
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,360
You can go now.

243
00:16:57,430 --> 00:17:00,050
When Neon Webtoon was launching in the beginning,

244
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:03,390
everyone strongly recommended buying Young Toon.

245
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:05,210
However,

246
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:09,900
I... rejected that and

247
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:14,890
chose Ginger Toon's Jang Man Cheol and its editing team.

248
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:17,310
I'm always thankful for that—

249
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:20,110
You don't need to thank me.

250
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:25,790
I'll fire you without hesitation if you continue subpar performance.

251
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:28,460
Don't make me regret my decision

252
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:31,870
because I think the losses will be rather large.

253
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:35,930
I'm saying don't embarrass me in front of Heo Kwan Yeong.

254
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:40,980
Do you understand, Team Leader Jang Man Cheol?

255
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:44,200
I understood.

256
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:50,080
 "Gumiho Princess" Manuscript, Na Gang Nam 

257
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,440
What's happening?

258
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:57,030
Artist Na sent the manuscript two days early for some reason.

259
00:17:57,030 --> 00:17:59,280
 Gumiho Princess 

260
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,130
Isn't this like that thing?

261
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:03,410
They say some husbands treat their wives nicely when they start an affair.

262
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:04,870
Like coming home early for no reason and bringing flowers.

263
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:06,530
It means he already decided to move elsewhere.

264
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:08,940
Hey! Don't say such an unlucky thing.

265
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:11,650
No. I think so, too.

266
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:14,840
Where is Seok Ji Hyeong right now?

267
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,040
Tell him to come in immediately.

268
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:18,370
Y-Yes. S-Seonbae Seok Ji Hyeong ...

269
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:20,310
What is it?

270
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:22,440
What's wrong?

271
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:24,830
 Webtoon 

272
00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:37,260
So... you failed to persuade him.

273
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:41,450
He said he needs some time to think.

274
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:43,630
Some time to think, my foot.

275
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:46,290
You mean he needs time to play strategic games with Young Toon.

276
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:48,870
The artist's intention matters the most.

277
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:51,760
Gosh. All of you are too relaxed about this.

278
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:56,130
You've got to hold him back by any means.

279
00:18:56,130 --> 00:18:59,600
Are there any special hidden clauses in the contract?

280
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:02,480
- PD Kwon.
 - Stop acting so high-minded and

281
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,580
think about the sales from "Gumiho Princess."

282
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:06,680
It's over 10 billion won annually.

283
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:11,130
If that revenue stops all of a sudden, do you have an alternative to fill the gap?

284
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:13,900
If you lose the artist to another company

285
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:16,540
and cause a loss for the company while acting all kind and respectful,

286
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:19,810
will you take responsibility for that, Deputy Editor?

287
00:19:19,810 --> 00:19:21,300
Huh?

288
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:23,800
Um...

289
00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:29,690
I'm the PD in charge of Artist Na Gang Nam.

290
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:33,410
I know I can't take responsibility for anything yet, but

291
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:37,710
if anyone is to take the blame in this situation,

292
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:41,100
I think that would be me. I'm so sorry.

293
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,510
Responsibility.

294
00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:50,550
That's for me to take.

295
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:54,680
PD On Ma Eum and PD Seok Ji Hyeong.

296
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,700
- Yes? 
- Yes.

297
00:19:56,700 --> 00:20:00,020
Try to convince Artist Na until the very end.

298
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:03,520
Here at Neon Webtoon, Artist Na is...

299
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,780
I beg this of you both.

300
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:13,860
Please hold him back.

301
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:15,780
Yes.

302
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:17,480
Okay.

303
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:34,350
Tell me if you think you can't do it and I will talk to him.

304
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:38,240
No, I'll try persuading him again.

305
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,100
"Gumiho Princess"...

306
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:44,480
"Gumiho Princess" is...

307
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,460
We really can't, you know.

308
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:48,340
Yes, I know.

309
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:52,490
It's the last vestige of Ginger Toon.

310
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:56,730
But I just had nothing to say when

311
00:20:56,730 --> 00:21:00,940
he said he's getting tense because it feels like he's stagnant

312
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:03,410
while the world changes by the second.

313
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:08,040
And asking him to stay where he is...

314
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:12,010
It feels like it's just my greed.

315
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:23,700
 An old comic book is bringing back memories 

316
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:31,480
 How to reverse time... 
   

317
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:41,050
"Please! Time Machine."

318
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:45,580
What's this? Didn't you turn in the manuscript?

319
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:48,680
Gosh, why are you doing this again?

320
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,740
Aren't we going out on a date?

321
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:52,930
I got a good offer from a different platform.

322
00:21:52,930 --> 00:21:55,390
So, I just want to write the story in advance.

323
00:21:56,290 --> 00:22:00,520
Then, are you finally ending the "Gumiho Princess" series?

324
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:03,510
Well. Yeah.

325
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:06,230
That's great! I was so sick and tired of it!

326
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:08,900
Hey! That's harsh!

327
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:12,280
"Gumiho Princess" fed me and kept me alive for over five years.

328
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:15,300
Well, it didn't feed me.

329
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:18,580
I also make a lot of money, Oppa.

330
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:25,880
Then can't we go out and have fun today?

331
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:28,180
Let's go party! A farewell party for "Gumino Princess."

332
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:31,380
- Let's go.
 - No, we can party after it ends officially.

333
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:33,730
- Gosh, let's go!
 - W-Wait. Let me just finish this.

334
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:36,480
- I need to finish that first.
 - Come on, just go!

335
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,430
- Party's not the issue here— 
 - Let's go!

336
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:51,800
It tastes good.

337
00:22:52,490 --> 00:22:54,350
Did you tell Mandu about it yet?

338
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:56,900
- That you're ending "Gumiho Princess"? 
- No, not yet.

339
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:58,180
She'll be sad.

340
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:01,520
I noticed that she's a fanatic for "Gumiho Princess" last time.

341
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:07,650
Oh, if you go to a different platform, are you also done with Mandu?

342
00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:10,080
And done with Deputy Editor Seok Ji Hyeong, too?

343
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,440
Well, yeah, unless I sign another contract with Neon.

344
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:16,230
Gosh, that's a little bit sad.

345
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:18,720
They were both cute, right?

346
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:23,280
If I go to a different platform, you can never run away again, okay?

347
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,810
- Why?
 - "Wh-Why?"

348
00:23:24,810 --> 00:23:26,430
Wh-What do you mean "why"?

349
00:23:26,430 --> 00:23:29,410
No one there is going to look for you and bring you back.

350
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:32,650
Well, that sucks. So boring.

351
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:34,440
Borin—

352
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:41,950
- How does this work? 
  - Give it. This way.

353
00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:17,510
 PD On Ma Eum 

354
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:21,080
 - Artist Na!  
- PD On, what's up so late?

355
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:24,470
I have something to confess to you.

356
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:26,210
What confession?

357
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:31,600
About how much influence "Gumiho Princess" had in my life.

358
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,660
 It's true! 

359
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:36,700
Whenever I struggled in Judo,

360
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:38,910
you don't know how much

361
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:43,850
every word and every action from San Ha comforted me.

362
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:48,350
 Since college, San Ha has been 

363
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:53,800
my role model and my friend.

364
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:56,160
 I'm sure Gumiho Princess San Ha 

365
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:59,850
is a role model and friend to plenty of girls in their teens and 20s.

366
00:24:59,850 --> 00:25:03,270
Why are you telling me this in the middle of the night all of a sudden?

367
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:05,040
I just...

368
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:10,510
wished that... you would keep this series going for a long, long time.

369
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:12,030
You heard something from someone, huh?

370
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:15,640
My goodness, I told him not to tell you.

371
00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:21,480
I hope it was a little bit of help in making your decision.

372
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:25,530
Anyway, thanks.

373
00:25:25,530 --> 00:25:28,420
It was a very touching confession.

374
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:32,150
 Although it was not helpful at all. 

375
00:25:33,930 --> 00:25:35,810
Good night.

376
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:56,630
 I think your pictorial style is 

377
00:25:56,630 --> 00:26:01,710
 is more suited to brighter stories than dark ones. 

378
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:04,540
 - Sorry? 
 - What I'm saying is... 

379
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:07,630
 your strokes are more cheerful and energetic than you'd think. 

380
00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:12,480
 So, I think it'd suit a more flashy and cute character 

381
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:15,010
 and that type of story. 

382
00:26:15,010 --> 00:26:16,890
 What do you think? 

383
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:23,090
 Trust me, and let's work together. 

384
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:27,790
 Artist Na. 

385
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:47,790
Gosh, this is just too much.

386
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:51,770
Oh, my God!

387
00:26:51,770 --> 00:26:55,690
Dad! Mind your manners and knock, please!

388
00:26:55,690 --> 00:26:57,910
You lash out even when I bring you your laundry?

389
00:26:57,910 --> 00:27:01,170
- When did I ask you to fold them... 
 - Hey, you!

390
00:27:01,170 --> 00:27:04,350
Do I have to get yelled at while I'm folding the laundry for my grown-up freeloader of a daughter?

391
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:06,050
I'm not a freeloader!

392
00:27:06,050 --> 00:27:08,520
Why do you always treat me like a freeloader?

393
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:10,070
I also have my own plans!

394
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:12,060
What's wrong with you?

395
00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:16,420
Have a word with me later.

396
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:18,130
I hate you, too, Mom.

397
00:27:18,130 --> 00:27:20,980
You favor Eonni all the time.

398
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:25,570
Gosh, he really startled me.

399
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:30,830
 "Origin of Mankind?"  Passed Out from Boredom! 

400
00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:32,390
Du Hui, I'm about to go crazy.

401
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:36,600
Does it make sense that the renowned Artist Oh Yun is all the way at the lower level there?

402
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:40,650
This is why I told you to make him do comedy, which is his forte.

403
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:43,930
Wh-Why are you trying to sell tteokbokki at a Chinese food restaurant?

404
00:27:43,930 --> 00:27:45,140
Black bean tteokbokki.

405
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:48,260
Sounds goo— You want to die?

406
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:51,720
He says he'll go elsewhere if we don't publish his work. What do I do?

407
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:54,440
It has some comedy because I got through to him with my feedback.

408
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,880
It was originally a lot drier without a hint of humor.

409
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,620
Whether dry or moist.

410
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:01,480
It's not fun to read, you know.

411
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:03,360
I'm sorry.

412
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:06,830
Try suggesting an early termination.

413
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:15,700
- Sorry? 
 - If Artist Na leaves, the revenue gap will be huge.

414
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:17,940
Ten billion won annually.

415
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:21,660
To fill that gap, at least Artist Oh Yun has to come back

416
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:24,100
to the comedy that he's good at so we can breathe.

417
00:29:08,030 --> 00:29:11,020
What exactly is "Peeve"?

418
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:14,650
"Peeve" is...

419
00:29:14,650 --> 00:29:18,670
a conceptual weapon that controls the potentials of mankind...

420
00:29:18,670 --> 00:29:20,820
Well, so...

421
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:24,940
It's a monster that... creates fear, so...

422
00:29:25,690 --> 00:29:27,790
- So... 
- So.

423
00:29:27,790 --> 00:29:29,870
What is it, exactly?

424
00:29:30,890 --> 00:29:32,900
For "Peeve Weapon,"

425
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:36,500
unless the concept of "Peeve" is understood by the readers,

426
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:39,030
it will fail before it even begins.

427
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:48,420
In my opinion, Artist Sin Dae Ryuk is drawing according to his instincts.

428
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:49,640
What that means is that

429
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:52,930
he, himself, may not be sure about the nature

430
00:29:52,930 --> 00:29:56,500
of what he is trying to express.

431
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:58,780
Just because Artist Sin said those words,

432
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:01,230
you can't just repeat his words

433
00:30:01,230 --> 00:30:05,020
- like a parrot.
 - Yes, I'll go and fix it.

434
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:06,550
Okay?

435
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:09,430
All right. Good job. You can go now.

436
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:10,840
Thank you.

437
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:13,040
- Thank you for your time.
 - Sure.

438
00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:20,410
Um...

439
00:30:23,730 --> 00:30:25,500
Never mind.

440
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:45,990
 PD Jang Hye Mi 

441
00:30:58,310 --> 00:30:59,900
Let's cheer up.

442
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:01,770
Cheer?

443
00:31:08,050 --> 00:31:09,880
Okay.

444
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:12,780
Fighting.

445
00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:18,800
Let's go!

446
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:24,870
It's easier to follow the story when one can relate to the characters.

447
00:31:24,870 --> 00:31:27,960
So, I think you need to revise and express more definite and clear emotions.

448
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:31,680
So that it'll be easier to understand "Peeve."

449
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,410
Okay, Well...

450
00:31:34,410 --> 00:31:39,020
I'll try since you're saying we need to do that.

451
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:41,760
But I'm not sure...

452
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:46,690
I'm just drawing out the images in my mind.

453
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:51,420
Excuse me, I need to go to the men's room.

454
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:52,850
Sure.

455
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:04,560
Wasn't that too harsh?

456
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:09,350
Are you okay? Are you okay?

457
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:11,780
Are you hurt?

458
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:22,340
Artist Sin Dae Ryuk!

459
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:28,820
I'll consider your suggestions while I work today.

460
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:31,410
Wait—

461
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:41,090
Why did you ask to meet?

462
00:32:41,090 --> 00:32:44,560
My heart skipped a beat because you hit me up first, Seonbae.

463
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:48,880
Skipped a beat?

464
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:51,060
You know why I called.

465
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:55,860
What did you offer Artist Na, exactly?

466
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:00,000
I guess you really don't want to lose Artist Na?

467
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:09,100
You know what his current work means for us, don't you?

468
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:12,030
Are you doing this because you know?

469
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:15,380
Seonbae.

470
00:33:16,130 --> 00:33:19,650
Do you think I'm doing this out of personal feelings?

471
00:33:19,650 --> 00:33:21,540
I'm Young Toon's deputy editor.

472
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:26,070
I just made an offer to an artist we need.

473
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:31,380
Also, "Gumiho Princess" is meaningful for only you and Editor Jang

474
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:34,540
because the series started at Ginger Toon.

475
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:37,820
Artist Na originally hated drawing "Gumiho Princess,"

476
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:40,480
saying it's not his style.

477
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:45,130
You're the one making an artist reject a good offer, because of personal feelings,

478
00:33:45,130 --> 00:33:47,660
and asking him to continue with that webtoon.

479
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:50,010
That is so selfish.

480
00:34:06,790 --> 00:34:11,600
 Chungma Study Dorm 

481
00:34:21,330 --> 00:34:25,510
 It's easier to follow the story when one can relate to the characters. 

482
00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:28,920
 So, I think you need to revise and express more definite and clear emotions. 

483
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:32,870
 So that it'll be easier to understand "Peeve." 

484
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:19,850
What do I need to do about this?

485
00:35:19,850 --> 00:35:21,030
Good morning!

486
00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:22,690
Good morning.

487
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:25,910
On Ma Eum and Gu Jun Yeong, see me for a second.

488
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:28,190
- Yes. 
 - In the conference room.

489
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:29,800
Okay.

490
00:35:31,070 --> 00:35:32,830
Fighting.

491
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:35,500
Whoa, this cartoon is!

492
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,330
- You know? Have you read it?
 - Yes.

493
00:35:37,330 --> 00:35:38,800
Isn't this a really old cartoon?

494
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:41,170
That's right. Wow...

495
00:35:41,170 --> 00:35:43,340
- What about you, Gu Jun Yeong?
 - It's my first time seeing it.

496
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:44,650
Right.

497
00:35:44,650 --> 00:35:47,130
It came out before you were born.

498
00:35:47,130 --> 00:35:48,420
Try reading it.

499
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:50,780
It's a representative work of the 90's time slip genre.

500
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:53,920
It's fun but also holds great literary value.

501
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,600
- Okay.
 - So I was thinking,

502
00:35:55,600 --> 00:36:00,660
I want you two to develop the remake proposal of this cartoon together.

503
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:01,660
Excuse me?

504
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:04,490
Are you going to remake "Please, Time Machine"?

505
00:36:04,490 --> 00:36:07,710
Since we're targeting people who are

506
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:10,440
younger than you two or don't know this cartoon, 
  Please, Time Machine 

507
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:13,140
I think you two should work on this

508
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:15,260
since you'll have reactions closest to our target audience.

509
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:18,020
Okay, I'll do my best.

510
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:20,970
What about you, Jun Yeong? You seem to think otherwise.

511
00:36:21,010 --> 00:36:26,950
Well, I thinkthere may be parts that don't go with the latest trend.

512
00:36:26,950 --> 00:36:31,350
What is the purpose behind reviving an old work?

513
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:34,550
What is the purpose?

514
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:40,170
In the past, we could read cartoons only if they were printed as books but we read them as webtoons these days.

515
00:36:40,170 --> 00:36:44,050
But not only that, nowadays, they've become popular memes on SNS.

516
00:36:44,050 --> 00:36:45,000
 D*** it 

517
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:45,890
 You really don't watch what you say 

518
00:36:45,890 --> 00:36:48,850
You didn't know that this cartoon's meme is trending nowadays, right?

519
00:36:48,850 --> 00:36:50,100
I saw it.

520
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:52,820
You did? Okay.

521
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:55,290
Even though it's a fast-paced world,

522
00:36:55,290 --> 00:36:57,530
it's a little sad if things disappear just because they're old.

523
00:36:57,530 --> 00:37:00,180
Some good things should remain.

524
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:03,020
I think it's worth it.

525
00:37:03,850 --> 00:37:07,000
But this is just an opinion of an old man.

526
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,320
Real modern people, your opinions are important.

527
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:13,250
So, I want you to develop the proposal together.

528
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:17,210
I'm down for it.

529
00:37:18,490 --> 00:37:20,250
Me, too.

530
00:37:21,350 --> 00:37:23,330
It's going to be fun.

531
00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:28,050
It seems like you're taking longer with your manuscripts lately,

532
00:37:28,050 --> 00:37:31,710
and I was also worried about your wrist. 
  Red Ginseng Set 

533
00:37:33,330 --> 00:37:35,480
Thank you, PD Choi. 
  Red Ginseng 

534
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:37,890
You're the best, PD Choi.

535
00:37:47,450 --> 00:37:51,960
My confidence plummets because the views dropped all of a sudden.

536
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:56,740
I progressed quickly when I had confidence, you know.

537
00:37:57,350 --> 00:37:59,410
I'm not sure where things went south.

538
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:03,010
 I think the very first step was off, Artist Oh. 

539
00:38:03,010 --> 00:38:04,980
How can you lose confidence?

540
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:07,760
We all put our hope in you.

541
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,590
I know, right?

542
00:38:12,310 --> 00:38:15,040
Maybe you didn't do enough marketing, putting too much hope in me?

543
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,150
You know, I have name value.

544
00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:20,100
It's weird that the views are this dead from this early on.

545
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:22,980
Are you sure you did enough marketing?

546
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:26,790
I can assure you that we did enough marketing not to fall behind our other series.

547
00:38:26,790 --> 00:38:29,270
- Are you sure?
 - Yes.

548
00:38:32,770 --> 00:38:35,840
What's the problem then, exactly?

549
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:39,930
PD Choi, is "Origin of Mankind" really that boring?

550
00:38:39,930 --> 00:38:42,100
 Yes, Artist Oh. 

551
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:44,010
It's not that it's boring.

552
00:38:44,010 --> 00:38:47,710
It's just that... it's unfamiliar?

553
00:38:47,710 --> 00:38:50,330
It's not the familiar fun that we know.

554
00:38:50,330 --> 00:38:51,620
Yes!

555
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:53,360
But it's a new kind of fun, right?

556
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:56,030
New and unfamiliar fun.

557
00:38:56,030 --> 00:38:58,730
New and unfamiliar doesn't necessarily mean boring, right?

558
00:38:58,730 --> 00:39:01,010
I... I guess so.

559
00:39:01,010 --> 00:39:05,040
Then why are the views so dead!

560
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:08,740
 The answer is already set. 

561
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:10,510
 This conversation will not end at this rate. 

562
00:39:10,510 --> 00:39:13,300
Um, Artist Oh?

563
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:16,910
Do you have an idea?

564
00:39:16,910 --> 00:39:19,660
What do you think about...

565
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:23,970
going back to comedy, your original forte?

566
00:39:23,970 --> 00:39:24,790
What?

567
00:39:24,790 --> 00:39:28,290
I don't think the viewers are quite ready for your new webtoon

568
00:39:28,290 --> 00:39:30,160
that gives them new and unfamiliar fun.

569
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:33,530
Are you suggesting an early termination?

570
00:39:33,530 --> 00:39:36,560
If it's okay with you, we can prepare another story concurrently

571
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,330
then start the new series when we end the current one.

572
00:39:38,330 --> 00:39:39,240
Are you kidding me?

573
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:41,650
Are you saying you'll mark me as an early termination artist?

574
00:39:41,650 --> 00:39:44,560
- No, it's not that—
 - Whoa, Neon and PD Choi!

575
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:47,500
I thought you guys were better than this. This is too much!

576
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:49,350
Is this how you pull the rug out from under me?

577
00:39:49,350 --> 00:39:51,010
No! It's not that at all, Artist Oh.

578
00:39:51,010 --> 00:39:54,090
I just asked your thoughts on it.

579
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:56,880
Of course, I don't want to.

580
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:59,840
I'll never terminate it early. Over my dead body.

581
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:03,580
No matter how low the views get, I'll see it to the end!

582
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:08,310
 We're doomed. 

583
00:40:10,770 --> 00:40:15,540
If you want, Artist Na, we can take a break and

584
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:19,310
let you publish on Young Toon simultaneously.

585
00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:23,090
Will I have enough stamina?

586
00:40:24,050 --> 00:40:28,980
If I end it, Steamed Mandu will cry, won't she?

587
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:33,540
I think I'd want to cry, too.

588
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:36,860
What's wrong? That's not like you.

589
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:41,490
It's my sincerest hope that

590
00:40:42,530 --> 00:40:48,820
I can do this marathon with you as long as possible, but...

591
00:40:52,590 --> 00:40:54,800
Despite that,

592
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:59,590
if you do decide to end the series,

593
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:02,160
please end it

594
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:07,530
with an amazing ending to be remembered.

595
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:10,600
And create a masterpiece

596
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:13,820
so that the fans who stuck together

597
00:41:16,370 --> 00:41:18,880
can be proud.

598
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:23,710
D-Do you mean that?

599
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:26,800
Yes.

600
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:38,140
Hurry up.

601
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:43,830
Over here?

602
00:41:46,350 --> 00:41:49,540
What are you doing, Oppa? We're already late because of you.

603
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:50,680
Oh, I'm sorry. S-So sorry.

604
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:52,380
Wh-Where, where shall we go?

605
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:54,850
Let's go.

606
00:41:54,850 --> 00:41:56,930
Ta-da!

607
00:41:56,930 --> 00:41:58,910
- How is it?
 - So pretty. It's the best.

608
00:41:58,910 --> 00:42:01,010
Then another one.

609
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:04,060
This one. This is what I saw before.

610
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:05,820
- How is this one?
 - Do that one.

611
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:08,090
- Go.
 - Okay.

612
00:42:48,550 --> 00:42:50,620
Sorry, sorry.

613
00:43:15,590 --> 00:43:18,150
Sweetie, where are you?

614
00:43:18,150 --> 00:43:20,340
I-I'm...

615
00:43:21,650 --> 00:43:23,170
I'm at...

616
00:43:23,170 --> 00:43:25,560
I said where are you!

617
00:43:30,570 --> 00:43:32,750
Have some salad.

618
00:43:35,510 --> 00:43:37,060
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

619
00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:41,250
I think I was really enchanted by something.

620
00:43:41,250 --> 00:43:43,230
Don't you ever up and leave me alone.

621
00:43:43,230 --> 00:43:46,400
Of course, I would never do that. Never.

622
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:50,590
Promise.

623
00:43:50,590 --> 00:43:52,300
Promise.

624
00:44:37,910 --> 00:44:41,580
How can you leave me alone when I just told you not to do that?

625
00:44:41,580 --> 00:44:43,710
O-Oh, I'm s-so sorry. But really!

626
00:44:43,710 --> 00:44:46,050
There really was the Gumiho Princess here!

627
00:44:46,050 --> 00:44:48,480
At the shopping mall before and the restaurant just now, too!

628
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:50,110
Are you insane?

629
00:44:50,150 --> 00:44:52,950
Did you finally go mad? Get your head straight!

630
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:56,950
I'm sick and tired of that d*** "Gumiho Princess"!

631
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:08,680
You can never end "Gumiho Princess," Oppa,

632
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:11,890
because you love that b**** more than me.

633
00:46:17,650 --> 00:46:19,440
This is...

634
00:46:36,570 --> 00:46:39,310
 Artist Na Gang Nam 

635
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:50,300
Yes, Artist Na.

636
00:46:52,230 --> 00:46:54,020
I see.

637
00:46:55,710 --> 00:46:57,440
Okay.

638
00:47:00,950 --> 00:47:03,650
Oh, yes, yes. All right. Yes.

639
00:47:03,690 --> 00:47:05,470
Yes.

640
00:47:05,470 --> 00:47:09,160
Thank you so much, Artist Na.

641
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:11,030
Yes.

642
00:47:12,370 --> 00:47:17,240
Was that Artist Na? Wh-What, what did he say?

643
00:47:18,990 --> 00:47:21,790
He said he'll continue "Gumiho Princess."

644
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:23,940
Oh, my. What's wrong?

645
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:26,670
No, my legs are weak right now.

646
00:47:26,670 --> 00:47:29,560
- Here, get up.
 - Thank you.

647
00:47:30,230 --> 00:47:33,390
Instead, I guess he wants to work on his new piece as well.

648
00:47:33,390 --> 00:47:37,570
He has an old 20-episode horror genre webtoon that he drew before.

649
00:47:37,570 --> 00:47:40,270
He wants to try releasing that on Young Toon.

650
00:47:40,270 --> 00:47:41,370
Anything is good.

651
00:47:41,370 --> 00:47:43,300
Thank you, thank you!

652
00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:46,940
I'm so glad that it ended here!

653
00:47:49,150 --> 00:47:50,610
My God. 
  Answer right away 

654
00:47:50,610 --> 00:47:52,310
I  honestly thought—
  Answer right away 

655
00:47:52,310 --> 00:47:54,150
 - Anything new? 
 - My heart was shriveling up. 

656
00:47:54,150 --> 00:47:57,060
Then, shouldn't we tell Chief Editor about this?

657
00:47:57,060 --> 00:48:01,340
Oh, right. I'll call Hyeong Man Cheol and let him know.

658
00:48:01,340 --> 00:48:04,450
My goodness, I'm so relieved!

659
00:48:13,780 --> 00:48:20,050
I want to thank you so much, Artist Na.

660
00:48:20,050 --> 00:48:21,830
I'm also thankful.

661
00:48:21,830 --> 00:48:24,070
You don't need to thank me.

662
00:48:24,070 --> 00:48:25,760
It wasn't me.

663
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:27,890
It was all her.

664
00:48:29,110 --> 00:48:31,280
What does that mean?

665
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:33,670
There's something like that...

666
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:43,640
Even if I try to write a different story or draw a different character,

667
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:46,450
I keep drawing "Gumiho Princess."

668
00:48:46,450 --> 00:48:48,800
She came out in my dream, too.

669
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:52,900
Even showing up as hallucinations during the day.

670
00:48:53,630 --> 00:48:55,890
I knew it. You don't believe me. You think I'm lying, right?

671
00:48:55,890 --> 00:48:57,210
It's true.

672
00:48:57,210 --> 00:49:04,070
This wicked girl ran inside my head all day asking me not to abandon her.

673
00:49:04,070 --> 00:49:06,240
It's got it's own life.

674
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:09,590
I can't end a webtoon like that on my own, you know?

675
00:49:12,060 --> 00:49:15,550
I used to be a pathetic bike that moved alone.

676
00:49:15,550 --> 00:49:19,960
It's this "Gumiho Princess" who turned me into a huge airplane.

677
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:24,870
For now, I want to continue flying with many people onboard this airplane.

678
00:49:24,870 --> 00:49:29,970
I'm really glad...

679
00:49:31,010 --> 00:49:36,120
that I still have a chance to tell you this.

680
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:38,620
In fact, I also...

681
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:44,010
like it.

682
00:49:45,970 --> 00:49:49,170
I'm a fan of "Gumiho Princess."

683
00:49:49,170 --> 00:49:51,870
As big a fan as Ma Eum.

684
00:49:51,870 --> 00:49:54,690
A crazy fan.

685
00:49:55,580 --> 00:49:57,560
I'm a genuine fan.

686
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:01,800
A big fan!

687
00:50:04,610 --> 00:50:07,240
You can't beat me!

688
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:10,500
By the way, you see...

689
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:11,730
- You know...
 - Yes?

690
00:50:11,730 --> 00:50:14,740
C-Could you go and find Han Seul for me tomorrow?

691
00:50:14,740 --> 00:50:17,390
She ran away again.

692
00:50:17,390 --> 00:50:19,020
What kind of a joke is that?

693
00:50:19,020 --> 00:50:20,960
She ran away.

694
00:50:21,740 --> 00:50:23,450
For real.

695
00:50:24,810 --> 00:50:26,440
For real?

696
00:50:31,610 --> 00:50:33,910
I'm glad. So glad.

697
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:38,220
PD Gu.

698
00:50:45,550 --> 00:50:50,350
You'll have to take an extra good care of Artist Pomme for now.

699
00:50:50,350 --> 00:50:51,040
Sorry?

700
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:54,640
Young Toon's movements are suspicious these days.

701
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:56,220
Just like they did with Artist Na,

702
00:50:56,220 --> 00:51:01,150
they might contact other artists, saying to start new work on their platform

703
00:51:01,150 --> 00:51:03,650
and try to recruit them.

704
00:51:04,950 --> 00:51:08,250
Okay. I'll pay more attention.

705
00:51:16,050 --> 00:51:18,160
Gosh, so creepy.

706
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:21,230
How the heck did he find out my address?

707
00:51:21,230 --> 00:51:24,850
- Artist Pomme, are you on SNS? 
- Yes.

708
00:51:24,850 --> 00:51:26,770
Did you post a lot of home pictures?

709
00:51:26,770 --> 00:51:29,410
No, I didn't...

710
00:51:34,410 --> 00:51:36,930
I guess I did post a few.

711
00:51:36,930 --> 00:51:38,770
Let me see.

712
00:51:44,810 --> 00:51:46,720
I should delete that right now.

713
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:48,880
 Delete 

714
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:51,890
 Are you sure you want to delete? / Delete 

715
00:51:51,890 --> 00:51:54,050
Cut off from SNS for now.

716
00:51:54,050 --> 00:51:56,220
It could be dangerous.

717
00:51:57,330 --> 00:51:59,550
Do you have anyone to call over?

718
00:51:59,550 --> 00:52:02,200
Someone who can be with you for a while.

719
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:08,220
My parents live in the country and I don't want to worry them uselessly by telling them.

720
00:52:08,220 --> 00:52:11,880
I don't have any friends who are that close.

721
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:16,020
What about having your assistants work here for a while?

722
00:52:16,020 --> 00:52:18,710
- How many do you have?
 - Two people. A woman and a man.

723
00:52:18,710 --> 00:52:19,930
That's good.

724
00:52:19,930 --> 00:52:23,780
Why don't you tell them to commute here together?

725
00:52:26,100 --> 00:52:29,600
I've never met them offline, though.

726
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:31,690
This is a good chance to meet them.

727
00:52:31,690 --> 00:52:35,280
It's better than falling behind schedule from being anxious by yourself.

728
00:52:37,850 --> 00:52:40,720
- You're not worried about me, right?
 - What?

729
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:43,760
You're worried that I might miss an episode, right?

730
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:45,410
That's not it.

731
00:52:45,410 --> 00:52:49,060
Of course, I'm worried about you first and foremost.

732
00:52:49,060 --> 00:52:50,840
Why would you even say that?

733
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:52,770
I'll also come by often.

734
00:52:52,770 --> 00:52:55,880
Okay. Leave now.

735
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:59,610
I won't miss an episode and will meet my deadline.

736
00:52:59,610 --> 00:53:01,590
Go.

737
00:53:01,590 --> 00:53:03,780
I said go.

738
00:53:07,420 --> 00:53:09,450
Artist, I have a question for you.

739
00:53:09,450 --> 00:53:12,920
- What is it? 
- Who is the other platform you said you had a meeting with?

740
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:14,440
Why do you ask all of a sudden?

741
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:16,790
You didn't care at all back then.

742
00:53:16,790 --> 00:53:19,380
Because I care now.

743
00:53:19,380 --> 00:53:21,750
It was Young Toon. Why?

744
00:53:21,750 --> 00:53:24,440
Deputy Editor Jang Hye Mi?

745
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:26,590
Was that her name?

746
00:53:26,590 --> 00:53:28,000
It was a female deputy editor.

747
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,420
I'm supposed to meet her again soon.

748
00:53:29,420 --> 00:53:31,120
Artist Pomme, please don't go anywhere.

749
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:33,060
I'll do better.

750
00:53:33,060 --> 00:53:35,850
What is this sudden change of attitude?

751
00:53:35,850 --> 00:53:38,300
- It's not like you, PD Gu.
 - What?

752
00:53:38,300 --> 00:53:41,260
You're more attractive when you're uppity, PD Gu.

753
00:53:41,260 --> 00:53:42,450
Go now.

754
00:53:42,450 --> 00:53:44,270
Leave.

755
00:53:45,350 --> 00:53:48,140
- Don't go anywhere else, okay?
 - Go!

756
00:54:00,170 --> 00:54:04,460
What is Artist Sin Dae Ryuk trying to express through "Peeve Weapon"?

757
00:54:04,460 --> 00:54:06,990
Fear and domination.

758
00:54:06,990 --> 00:54:09,110
What is Artist Sin Dae Ryuk trying to

759
00:54:09,110 --> 00:54:12,840
express through a "Peave Weapon?"

760
00:54:15,420 --> 00:54:16,890
What is it?

761
00:54:16,890 --> 00:54:19,280
Weren't you going home right after?

762
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:23,370
To prepare for the series approval meeting.

763
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:28,320
Jun Yeong, you changed.

764
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:29,260
I did?

765
00:54:29,260 --> 00:54:31,170
You said you wouldn't work with a newbie artist at first.

766
00:54:31,170 --> 00:54:33,770
Right after the Webtoon Camp.

767
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:40,330
Then shall we prepare together?

768
00:54:40,330 --> 00:54:42,440
I was practicing pitching, but it was going nowhere.

769
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:45,860
I'll also help you prepare.

770
00:54:45,860 --> 00:54:49,060
- Okay. Let's work together.
 - Great.

771
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:53,790
There are three points regarding the purpose of the proposal.

772
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:55,870
We all live with a dream.

773
00:54:55,870 --> 00:54:59,430
I think it'd better if you can emphasize the keyword, dream.

774
00:54:59,430 --> 00:55:01,060
You look confident.

775
00:55:01,060 --> 00:55:02,960
♫  in the midst of the chaos  ♫

776
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:06,640
♫  there is a slightly ominous feeling  ♫

777
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:13,220
♫  There are days when even a small sigh  ♫

778
00:55:13,220 --> 00:55:15,540
♫  is particularly difficult.  ♫

779
00:55:15,540 --> 00:55:20,050
Instead of this line, this line is more appealing to others.

780
00:55:20,050 --> 00:55:23,010
It's possible that they wouldn't understand it.

781
00:55:23,010 --> 00:55:25,110
To draw forth relatability...

782
00:55:25,110 --> 00:55:30,650
♫  since like the bright sunlight I will be with you on your tomorrow  ♫

783
00:55:30,650 --> 00:55:33,620
♫  I want to hear today's you  ♫

784
00:55:33,620 --> 00:55:37,520
♫  It's fine even if it is just cliches  ♫

785
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:42,200
♫  Tell me all the things you do, my love  ♫

786
00:55:42,250 --> 00:55:48,850
♫  On your day which was busy getting warm hugs  ♫

787
00:55:48,850 --> 00:55:53,600
♫  I will always be with you, my love  ♫

788
00:55:53,650 --> 00:55:56,610
♫  It's okay to stop for a while.  ♫

789
00:55:56,610 --> 00:56:01,000
♫  I will wait without saying anything.  ♫

790
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:07,200
♫  I will always be with you, my love  ♫

791
00:56:13,260 --> 00:56:15,350
You're all here.

792
00:56:15,350 --> 00:56:16,800
Okay.

793
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:18,930
Now, now.

794
00:56:18,930 --> 00:56:20,470
On Ma Eum.

795
00:56:20,470 --> 00:56:22,830
Did you prepare well?

796
00:56:22,830 --> 00:56:24,960
Yes!

797
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:26,840
You sound confident.

798
00:56:26,840 --> 00:56:28,920
Okay, then.

799
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:32,740
We shall start the new series approval meeting.

800
00:56:32,740 --> 00:56:34,470
Is "Full Count" first?

801
00:56:34,470 --> 00:56:37,670
Gu Jun Yeong, please begin.

802
00:56:37,670 --> 00:56:41,770
She has improved what we criticized before, which was having too much text. 
  Selling Point 

803
00:56:41,770 --> 00:56:46,550
A love line will also be added to enlarge the range of the target audience.

804
00:56:46,550 --> 00:56:50,560
I... thought it was fun.

805
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:54,490
The artist is high quality and if the love line is added,

806
00:56:54,490 --> 00:56:57,460
it will definitely help with the view count.

807
00:56:58,220 --> 00:56:59,390
You did a good job, PD Gu.

808
00:56:59,390 --> 00:57:01,140
Yes, good job, good job.

809
00:57:01,140 --> 00:57:03,810
You can always count on a baseball webtoon.

810
00:57:03,810 --> 00:57:06,560
Well, that's because you like baseball, Editor.

811
00:57:06,560 --> 00:57:08,010
Honestly, it's entertaining, though.

812
00:57:08,010 --> 00:57:10,070
- Isn't it fun?
 - It is.

813
00:57:10,070 --> 00:57:12,040
The plot and the directing are good for a rookie.

814
00:57:12,040 --> 00:57:13,780
Right!

815
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:18,150
Next is Artist Sin Dae Ryuk's "Peeve Weapon."

816
00:57:19,660 --> 00:57:21,590
On Ma Eum?

817
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:24,510
Let's see.

818
00:57:26,470 --> 00:57:29,590
Wow, the pictorial quality got a lot more stable.

819
00:57:29,590 --> 00:57:31,810
It's still quite rough, though.

820
00:57:31,810 --> 00:57:33,890
He can only get so far with his lack of basics.

821
00:57:33,890 --> 00:57:37,350
Rough lines can be seen as a unique quality.

822
00:57:37,350 --> 00:57:39,080
The dessin (drawing) looks good.

823
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:43,240
I think the mood matches the piece well.

824
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:45,560
But the content is the crucial part.

825
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:50,250
Could it be any fun if the artist makes it complicated for no reason?

826
00:57:51,630 --> 00:57:54,000
We still need to know it well to promote it well.

827
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:58,250
On Ma Eum, could you explain the world of "Peeve Weapon?"

828
00:57:58,250 --> 00:57:59,980
Yes.

829
00:58:16,990 --> 00:58:20,800
 What Artist Sin Dae Ryuk wishes to express through "Peeve Weapon" 

830
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:23,990
is fear and domination.

831
00:58:23,990 --> 00:58:26,800
Peeve is a weapon that adheres to people's fear 
  What is "Peeve"? 

832
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:29,400
and controls their hearts.

833
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:33,310
Peeve attacks the moment a person feels fear.

834
00:58:33,310 --> 00:58:35,720
It would be okay as long as we didn't feel fear.

835
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:38,390
But humans can never be free from fear.

836
00:58:38,390 --> 00:58:40,680
Colonel Kim Hwal, who is loved by everyone,

837
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:45,700
actually conspires to rule over mankind using Peeve.

838
00:58:45,700 --> 00:58:48,380
The main character Hwi Yeong is the only one

839
00:58:48,380 --> 00:58:53,030
who know his plans and speaks up against him.

840
00:58:53,030 --> 00:58:56,050
But the main character's image is too weak.

841
00:58:56,050 --> 00:58:58,840
Would he be in any way attractive looking so weak like that?

842
00:58:58,840 --> 00:59:02,610
Because he's tiny, weak, and ordinary,

843
00:59:02,610 --> 00:59:06,330
he's more desperately fighting against fear.

844
00:59:06,330 --> 00:59:09,270
The main character not only fights the enemy

845
00:59:09,270 --> 00:59:13,670
but also fights his inner fears with all his might.

846
00:59:13,670 --> 00:59:18,460
Because he is weak, he more desperately desires escape

847
00:59:18,460 --> 00:59:21,050
and  to be freed from his fears.

848
00:59:21,050 --> 00:59:26,030
We also fight our own demons every day.

849
00:59:26,030 --> 00:59:29,790
This could be a trauma from childhood

850
00:59:32,550 --> 00:59:35,540
or anxiety about the future.

851
00:59:38,870 --> 00:59:41,590
 Or it could also be a sense of loss. 

852
00:59:41,590 --> 00:59:46,240
The image of the main character and his friends in "Peeve Weapon" fighting against these things

853
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:50,920
will surely provide consolation and courage for readers

854
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:55,890
who struggle every day to fight their own lonely battles.

855
01:00:03,780 --> 01:00:05,860
That will be all.

856
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:07,830
That was good.

857
01:00:07,830 --> 01:00:11,240
I have an appointment. I'll be off first.

858
01:00:11,240 --> 01:00:12,830
Good job.

859
01:00:12,830 --> 01:00:14,790
You did well.

860
01:00:18,630 --> 01:00:22,540
PD Gu, you were sharp. Better than I thought.

861
01:00:41,750 --> 01:00:44,480
 Artist Sin, a great news for you. 

862
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:48,850
 "Peeve Weapon" has been confirmed for a series. 

863
01:00:54,430 --> 01:00:57,120
That's Seok Ji Hyeong for you.

864
01:00:57,120 --> 01:00:59,460
The rookies did a great job this time around.

865
01:00:59,460 --> 01:01:01,300
The PDs or the artists?

866
01:01:01,300 --> 01:01:03,220
Both, man.

867
01:01:03,220 --> 01:01:07,010
I had insisted to Director Heo that we'd get results from the recent Webtoon Camp.

868
01:01:07,010 --> 01:01:09,830
I think I'll get to show it to him.

869
01:01:10,980 --> 01:01:14,200
You did a good job leading the incubating team.

870
01:01:14,820 --> 01:01:16,920
This is just the start.

871
01:01:16,920 --> 01:01:20,810
They'll be on our backs if the performance is poor after they launch.

872
01:01:20,810 --> 01:01:25,440
Let's make an insanely good piece and end them with a grand slam, okay?

873
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:27,530
Please look after the kids until the end.

874
01:01:27,530 --> 01:01:29,470
Okay, Hyeong.

875
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:34,840
Take care now!

876
01:01:38,360 --> 01:01:41,090
Another typo!

877
01:01:41,090 --> 01:01:43,940
I read this part so many times already...

878
01:02:06,500 --> 01:02:09,020
Gosh, it woke me up.

879
01:02:10,520 --> 01:02:13,580
Jun Yeong, do you want some of this?

880
01:02:13,580 --> 01:02:16,030
I think it helps you focus.

881
01:02:16,030 --> 01:02:17,820
Thanks.

882
01:02:24,970 --> 01:02:27,440
Do you want to switch and review?

883
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:29,290
It's not registering in my eyes because I'm reading the same thing.

884
01:02:29,290 --> 01:02:31,000
Deal.

885
01:02:34,110 --> 01:02:35,530
Is this the part?

886
01:02:35,530 --> 01:02:36,810
Yes.

887
01:02:36,810 --> 01:02:38,460
Let's see.

888
01:02:44,700 --> 01:02:47,320
 At a full count, not only the pitcher but also the batter can be shaken. 

889
01:03:01,340 --> 01:03:02,530
What is this?

890
01:03:02,530 --> 01:03:04,650
You two didn't go home yet?

891
01:03:04,650 --> 01:03:07,420
We've got a lot to do for the launching prep.

892
01:03:07,420 --> 01:03:09,100
I see.

893
01:03:09,100 --> 01:03:10,370
Oh, right.

894
01:03:10,370 --> 01:03:13,760
- Both of your first artists are making their debut! 
 - Yes.

895
01:03:14,420 --> 01:03:16,610
You guys worked hard even from the camp.

896
01:03:16,610 --> 01:03:18,860
It's all thanks to you, Deputy Editor.

897
01:03:18,860 --> 01:03:20,610
You don't need to say that.

898
01:03:20,610 --> 01:03:22,520
You two did all the work of

899
01:03:22,520 --> 01:03:26,350
meeting the artist one-on-one, persuading them about the edits yourself.

900
01:03:29,050 --> 01:03:31,280
You're getting a call, Jun Yeong.
  Answer Right Away:  You could lose a homerun! 

901
01:03:32,860 --> 01:03:35,800
Is it okay not to answer? It said, "Answer right away."

902
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:37,330
It's fine.

903
01:03:37,330 --> 01:03:40,420
- It must be your girlfriend, right?
 - Sorry?

904
01:03:41,940 --> 01:03:44,370
I mean, you had it with a different caller ID and all.

905
01:03:44,370 --> 01:03:47,150
You had a girlfriend, Jun Yeong?

906
01:03:47,150 --> 01:03:50,420
N-No, that's not it.

907
01:03:57,090 --> 01:04:01,130
He keeps acting funny...

908
01:04:01,130 --> 01:04:03,960
Your face is turning red! It must be true.

909
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:05,850
- No, no. It's not.
 - Your ears are red, too!

910
01:04:05,850 --> 01:04:07,890
Then who is it? Who?

911
01:04:07,890 --> 01:04:09,960
It's not, really. Anyway...

912
01:04:09,960 --> 01:04:12,280
It's not. No...

913
01:04:12,280 --> 01:04:15,850
I didn't know you could get so embarrassed, Jun Yeong!

914
01:04:15,850 --> 01:04:19,830
Okay, I'll pretend that I don't know. You don't have to be that embarrassed.

915
01:04:20,620 --> 01:04:22,990
Anyway, you two wrap it up and go home.

916
01:04:22,990 --> 01:04:26,040
- You're going?
 - Yes, I'll be off first. See you tomorrow.

917
01:04:26,080 --> 01:04:28,800
- Please take care. 
- I'll see you tomorrow.

918
01:04:31,340 --> 01:04:35,880
Gosh, an unknown number at this time is a little shady...

919
01:04:37,300 --> 01:04:39,210
Hello?

920
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:43,580
Sorry?

921
01:04:46,090 --> 01:04:48,270
How have you been?

922
01:05:03,340 --> 01:05:07,280
 We want to have you at our company, Deputy Editor. 

923
01:05:08,420 --> 01:05:13,120
I want to scout you as Editor-in-Chief of Young Toon.

924
01:05:15,380 --> 01:05:22,420


925
01:05:24,250 --> 01:05:27,550
♫  Come to me once in a while at least  ♫

926
01:05:29,900 --> 01:05:33,230
♫  Try running until you're out of breath  ♫

927
01:05:35,540 --> 01:05:38,120
♫  Come to me once in a while at least  ♫

928
01:05:38,120 --> 01:05:41,300
♫  Come to me, Come to me  ♫

929
01:05:41,300 --> 01:05:44,540
♫  Try smiling one more time  ♫

930
01:05:46,410 --> 01:05:50,690
 Today's Webtoon 

931
01:05:51,380 --> 01:05:54,060
 Can you keep it a secret from the company? 

932
01:05:54,060 --> 01:05:57,030
 You'll be in a tough spot if it's found out later. 

933
01:05:57,030 --> 01:05:59,560
 I found out the whereabouts of Artist Ma. 

934
01:05:59,560 --> 01:06:01,980
 Human garbage. 

935
01:06:01,980 --> 01:06:06,230
 You seem to have changed your stance lately, Mr. Gu. 

936
01:06:07,050 --> 01:06:08,210
 Happy birthday. 

937
01:06:08,210 --> 01:06:10,350
 Wishing Happy Birthday to my friend whom I miss. 

938
01:06:10,350 --> 01:06:15,210
 I heard that Young Toon's next Editor-in-Chief will get an amazing offer. 

939
01:06:16,320 --> 01:06:20,050
 Why would the Deputy Editor meet with Young Toon? 

940
01:06:21,550 --> 01:06:26,950
♫  Today opens up, once again more  ♫
