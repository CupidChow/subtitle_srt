1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:10,890


2
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,850
 Today's Webtoon 

3
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:39,700
What's going on all of a sudden?

4
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:42,480
Why did you call everyone in? What's the emergency?

5
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,830
Hey, Seok Ji Hyeong!

6
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,940
- What the hell happened? 
 - What?

7
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:51,770
Artist Baek Eo Jin wants all of his manuscripts returned.

8
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:53,310
What?

9
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:56,570
He wants everything, including all the previews of the paid subscriptions, taken down right now.

10
00:00:56,570 --> 00:01:00,280
What did you say to him when you went over there?

11
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:04,990
I'm going to head over there now.

12
00:01:04,990 --> 00:01:06,330
Hey!

13
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:07,880
I'll go too.

14
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:10,000
What?  Hey! What are you going to...

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,980
This is driving me nuts. Seriously.

16
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:15,530
What should we do with uploads that are due today?

17
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:18,460
- Why ask? We have to send out a suspension notice. 
 - Suspension notice?

18
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:21,970
Go online now and out of Artist Baek Eo Jin's old manuscripts,

19
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:23,600
see if there's anything we can repost.

20
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,110
There may be some, but it's all black and white.

21
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:27,000
It doesn't matter! Just look for them!

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,560
We can't suspend airing our main artist's series for weeks.

23
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,490
I'll go look.

24
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:38,970
You take a break.

25
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:59,380
 "Dragon's Dream" - Notice of suspension 

26
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,500
A notice of suspension for Artist Baek Eo Jin?

27
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:05,980
Is there something going on?

28
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:09,600
Please tell him we really want to meet him, Madam.

29
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,880
Even if it's tomorrow...

30
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:12,960
Yes, ma'am.

31
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,740
Please do us a favor.

32
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:16,060
Yes, ma'am.

33
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:33,240
It's all my fault.

34
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:38,390
- What is? 
 - I uselessly told him to read the comments.

35
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:42,840
Comments were really vicious.

36
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:49,530
If he's hurt after reading comments,

37
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,100
I was out of line, and it's my fault. I'm really sorry.

38
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:55,530
No.

39
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:58,090
You don't know that.

40
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:00,730
Let's wait a bit.

41
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:02,190
Get in.

42
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:13,300
Hey, Hyeong, it's not that.

43
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:15,460
It's not working.

44
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:18,830
- Call PD Gi Yu Mi and tell them we can't go.
 - Okay.

45
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:21,030
No, we can't go right now.

46
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:22,980
We contacted him, but...

47
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:24,860
Okay, sir!

48
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:26,360
Yes, sir!

49
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:39,940
 Episode 2: Change dramatically! As long as it's different from now! 

50
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:54,910
Good morning.

51
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:01,610
Good morning.

52
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:08,320
We'll try to restore it quickly.

53
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,620
Yes, sir.

54
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:11,510
Deputy Editor went to persuade him

55
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:13,800
and he's in front of his house, but...

56
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,400
When you were there last time,

57
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,700
did he seem off or something?

58
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:20,730
We're trying to figure things out.

59
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:25,960
Did everyone stay up all night?

60
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,530
Yes.

61
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,510
Wow. Looks like several hundred million won will vanish.

62
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:35,250
I'm going to the production company meeting.

63
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:41,620
Excuse me.

64
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:43,460
Who are you looking for?

65
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:47,780
I have something to tell Artist Baek's manager.

66
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,670
That Kyeong Sik. Talk about turning on someone.

67
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:55,060
Artist Baek was so good to him.

68
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:56,940
And he worked here for five years.

69
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:58,690
Then, what happened yesterday...

70
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:01,190
He made a big mess before he left.

71
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:07,900
Are you leaving for the day?

72
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,640
Or...  are you leaving forever?

73
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,420
Dong Hui told me

74
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:20,150
that you signed a contract with Sinsang Platform?

75
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:21,170
Yes.

76
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:23,660
Did you review the contract in detail?

77
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:26,640
I heard Sinsang Platform contracts are notorious—

78
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:29,960
I will take care of it, Artist.

79
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:32,210
I'm just worried for you.

80
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:35,080
After making your debut, you couldn't work on new projects

81
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:39,030
and you came back as an assistant only a few years ago.

82
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:42,480
Why don't you prepare more and start your own series?

83
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:45,220
I told you I would take care of it!

84
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:47,820
- Please stop nagging like an old geezer! 
 - Hey!

85
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:51,960
And worry about yourself before you worry about me.

86
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:57,020
You don't know there's a rumor that your work is a mess, do you?

87
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:59,390
They all say that in the comments and community forums.

88
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:01,670
They say Baek Eo Jin is totally over the hill.

89
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:05,240
Not just one hill, but two or three hills. Now, you're obsolete.

90
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,450
That even your drawings are sagging.

91
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:08,730
and everything is a mess.

92
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:10,450
Hey, Yang Kyeong Sik!

93
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:12,260
What?

94
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:14,680
Sagging?

95
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,240
 Swoosh 

96
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:22,000
 Comments 

97
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:26,900
Aren't you going to sleep?

98
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:29,040
I'll go ahead and sleep.

99
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,740
Yes, I will go to sleep.

100
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:54,680
 Old man's cartoon is out of my list. 

101
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,820
 Old people should rest at home, please. 

102
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:01,090
 It was good until the "Dragon's Crisis." 

103
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:03,020
 He shouldn't have returned. 

104
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:06,630
 He returned for nothing to ruin the series' reputation. 

105
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:10,090
 He is old enough to smear poop on the wall. 

106
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:12,070
 I wish you all died. 

107
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:14,920
 Die, you insane freak. 

108
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:19,580
Yesterday... Artist Baek called me late at night.

109
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:24,510
He asked me what Ttul-ttak (denture clacking) means.

110
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:26,950
Ttu-ttu... Ttul-ttak?

111
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:28,810
 Oh, Ttul-ttak? 

112
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:34,360
 Ah, that's...what young kids call old people with old-fashioned ideas that don't fly in current times. 

113
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,050
 It's the sound of a denture chattering. Ttul-ttak-ttak... 

114
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:38,760
 So... anyway... 

115
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:41,900
It's not a nice thing to say. Why do you ask, sir?

116
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,460
"Doesn't fly in current times?"

117
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,260
I see.

118
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:52,640
Thank you at this late hour, Artist Ha.

119
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:04,920
 He never used the internet, so 

120
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:08,420
 it's probably his first time seeing vicious comments like that. 

121
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:13,320
 He was probably very very wounded by it. 

122
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:25,690
 Even "Dragon's Dream" characters have sagging faces. 

123
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:27,720
 Is the chin going to grow longer and longer? 

124
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:30,190
 His work is hopeless. 

125
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:33,080
 There's no hope. 

126
00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:46,960
Deputy Editor Seok Ji Hyeong came by again.

127
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:50,830
I didn't realize my drawings were falling apart.

128
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:53,120
I just kept drawing.

129
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:59,550
I guess it's time to step aside.

130
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:05,740
But... the part that shocks me more is that...

131
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:09,360
while I was drawing all this time...

132
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,070
the messages I wanted to deliver

133
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:14,430
was never delivered at all.

134
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:15,390
 How much longer is he going to draw comics? 

135
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:17,050
 It's hopeless... 
Must we listen to old people's nagging even in webtoons? 

136
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:21,390
The fact that humans and life are precious and beautiful.

137
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:26,840
That kindness is actually strength.

138
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:31,980
None of that was conveyed.

139
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:35,220
Not to the readers,

140
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:37,370
and not even to someone next to me all this time.

141
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:39,560
Not even to Kyeong Sik.

142
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:45,290
I thought I gave my all to my drawings,

143
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:48,820
but readers didn't feel anything at all.

144
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:53,780
Pathetic.

145
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:58,300
I feel very pathetic.

146
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:21,740
 GingerToon 

147
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:30,910
Hyeong, you had quit smoking.

148
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,740
I don't feel good about this.

149
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:35,860
It brings back memories too.

150
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:41,970
Don't worry too much.

151
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:44,980
I will try to resolve it somehow.

152
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,490
Artist Baek...

153
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:57,570
We should give him some time, right?

154
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,690
Yes.

155
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:02,800
Notice of suspension...

156
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,640
I'll upload a new one.

157
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,270
 Notice of suspension 

158
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:11,300
"Dragon's Dream" is suspended for now.

159
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:12,630
What?

160
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:13,720
Why?

161
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,790
I thought the suspension was just for one week.

162
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:17,280
I don't know.

163
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,860
Is the artist ill?

164
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:20,570
- He is old.
 - Oh, no!

165
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:22,440
He can't die before he finishes the series.

166
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,970
- That's too bad... 
 - So annoying.

167
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:26,710
 Notice of suspension 

168
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:34,010
Aigoo, Team Leader Jang Man Cheol.

169
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:36,900
He might not even last a year.

170
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,480
PD Gu Jun Yeong!

171
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,560
What are you doing here at the headquarters?

172
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,340
Isn't it too far for you to come all the way here?

173
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:45,660
Wow...

174
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:49,330
How's it going? Is webtoon all right for you?

175
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:50,860
It's not that fun.

176
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:54,110
I heard that team may be gone next year.

177
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:56,000
- Did you hear that?
 - What?

178
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,530
Next year, they are already planning to combine

179
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:02,730
and replace with Neon employees. That's what they say.

180
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:04,860
Then what will happen to Gu Jun Yeong?

181
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:07,070
- Aren't you wasting a year?
 - No way.

182
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:10,900
There must be a reason why the company sent Jun Yeong to that team.

183
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:13,140
Conference Room

184
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:14,520
Are you ready, Young Master?

185
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,300
Please

186
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:29,360
I definitely see that his drawings have changed compared to the old days.

187
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:31,840
 The old man is so f**king funny. 

188
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,700
 He really must be shocked. 

189
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:37,610
 I snapshot all these comments and texted them to him. 

190
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:40,080
 Thank me, you fools. 

191
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:43,330
 There's one open series position at Neon because the old man is gone. 

192
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:46,630
 - Really? 
  - You sure did pull it off. 

193
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:50,640
 But it's not like we can't make our debut because of the old man. 

194
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:54,850
 That is true. These days, young newbies coming up are scarier. 

195
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:57,260
 But still, one open position is still good like honey, right? 

196
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:58,300
 That's true. 

197
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:00,720
 It's been a while. This is fun. 

198
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:05,630
 Report 

199
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,080
This looks like it was written by Assistant Yang Kyeong Sik, right?

200
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,760
 Comments and replies 

201
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:16,040
Geez, this is too much, really.

202
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,710
I mean, how can a person be like this?

203
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:19,140
They've worked together for years!

204
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:21,130
Welcome.

205
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:28,090
- You are here. 
 - Yes, you were here already.

206
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:30,980
- Can we get one more glass?
 - Okay.

207
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:34,060
Thank you.

208
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:41,900
Before all this happened,

209
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,520
we should've done something.

210
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:47,020
PD Jeong was managing him before, so there's nothing we could've done.

211
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:49,850
Drawings change over time for artists who have worked for years.

212
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:51,180
It's pretty common.

213
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:56,400
But I think we should've opened up and talked to him.

214
00:13:56,400 --> 00:14:00,490
We just couldn't because he's such a master artist.

215
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:02,680
I couldn't, either.

216
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:05,340
I'm sorry.

217
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:16,890
 Everyone knew about it. 

218
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:20,660
Artist Baek Eo Jin...

219
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:25,380
He's not going to retire like this, is he?

220
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:27,800
Who knows.

221
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,090
When it comes to webtoon series,

222
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:36,940
the creator alone

223
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:40,230
creates a certain world.

224
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:44,170
 Without any guide book or anything. The artist alone 

225
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:46,870
 has to create the world 

226
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:51,250
 while meeting deadlines every week. 

227
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:56,170
 After uploading this week's and taking a breather, 

228
00:14:56,170 --> 00:14:59,880
 the upload deadline for next week is already waiting right in front of them. 

229
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:02,700
 Weekly stories and drawings, 

230
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:05,000
 and coloring too. 

231
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,010
 It's repetitive work like a spinning wheel. 

232
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:14,760
 Artist Baek Eo Jin 

233
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:20,030
 did all this alone for over 30 years 

234
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:32,460
For someone who did all that...

235
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:36,750
to stop and drop everything,

236
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:39,410
what should I say to him?

237
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:44,280
What would you have said, On Ma Eum?

238
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,520
Never mind.

239
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:53,700
I don't even know myself. So how would a newbie know?

240
00:15:55,210 --> 00:15:57,290
When I did judo,

241
00:15:57,290 --> 00:16:00,940
I had a similar experience.

242
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:02,780
At that time, I just

243
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:07,650
thanked my friends who wandered with me.

244
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:10,470
- Wander? 
 - It's simply hanging around together

245
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:12,120
and waiting for me to come around.

246
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:16,670
Of course, Artist Baek's situation is different from mine, but

247
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:20,080
if he's a true pacemaker (sets pace of 1st part of race),

248
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:24,930
I wouldn't force him by whipping, just so he can run again

249
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:28,140
is just my opinion.

250
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:32,200
So you are saying

251
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,670
patiently waiting is the answer?

252
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:39,020
But what if he's not wandering

253
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:41,280
but giving up?

254
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:47,880
Should we toss the coin again?

255
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:55,000
Whether Artist Baek will come back or not.

256
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,010
Let's see.

257
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:01,820
Heads means he will come back.

258
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:03,660
Tails means...

259
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:07,450
Well, it's telling us to wait a little longer.

260
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,940
♫  Everyday is my birthday  ♫

261
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:14,710
♫  I feel like a clumsy child  ♫

262
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:17,010
- Hold this for a second.
 - Okay.

263
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:18,940
All right.

264
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:20,400
Here we go.

265
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:24,960
♫  The little whisper of the wind, the warmth of the blazing sun  ♫

266
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,160
♫  greeted tired me with a "great job."  ♫

267
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:31,760
Okay, okay. I know this doesn't set our destiny or anything, but

268
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,440
- Yes, yes.
 - Wait a minute.

269
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:36,840
♫  I'm the only one who forgot to sleep  ♫

270
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:39,510
♫  My heart which shines like that far away starlight  ♫

271
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:40,900
Okay.

272
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:44,950
Abracadabra... 
 ♫  My heart which shines like that far away starlight  ♫

273
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:49,050
♫  Like the star passing through distant time which reached me  ♫

274
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:54,190
♫  Will I also be able to shine?  ♫

275
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:55,260
Ta-da.

276
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:58,570
♫  How is your day?   ♫

277
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:02,060
♫  A night dreaming dreams  ♫

278
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:04,200
He will come back.

279
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:06,850
Oh, the bus.

280
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:08,950
- There.
 - Oh, right.

281
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:10,760
- I'll go now.
 - Okay, okay.

282
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,230
Oh, okay.

283
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:13,810
- Bye now.
 - Get home safe.

284
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:15,600
Yes, sir.

285
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:20,900
Right, right.

286
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:33,570
 500 won - heads 

287
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:49,800
Is Gu Jun Yeong working out of the office?

288
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:53,320
I heard it's that day for PD Kwon.

289
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:55,370
He probably went with Jun Yeong.

290
00:18:55,370 --> 00:18:57,110
- That day?
 - Yeah.

291
00:18:57,110 --> 00:19:00,710
PD Kwon sits on all the requests from the artists

292
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:05,160
and takes care of them in one day. It's called Complaint Bomb Day.

293
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,880
I see...

294
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,890
I requested the thumbnail change a while ago.

295
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:11,480
How come there's been no feedback for over a month?

296
00:19:12,410 --> 00:19:16,860
No matter how I look at it, it's getting a low number of hits because of the bland thumbnail.

297
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:20,400
If I were Na Gang Nam or Pomme...

298
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,850
If I were top artists like them,

299
00:19:21,850 --> 00:19:24,340
would you have responded so late?

300
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:31,950
Why is my webtoon banner never on the main page?

301
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:35,380
- What?
 - I mean, artists like Pomme or Mo Wu Ri,

302
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:37,450
every time I log into the Neon website,

303
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:39,800
they're on the main page.

304
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,200
Do I need to say this myself?

305
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:45,060
I was very successful when I made my debut. 
  Life is Over 

306
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:47,350
Just because the second series went down in flames,

307
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:49,150
and if you treat me like a has-been,

308
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:52,350
I can't work with Neon, either.

309
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:53,880
I'm sorry.

310
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:55,500
I'm sorry.

311
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,800
Take a look.

312
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:59,100
Put mine here just for a day.

313
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,740
If mine is promoted the same way,

314
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:03,960
my view counts will be as high as these people. Don't you think?

315
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:08,410
Are you saying you are just going to wait?

316
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:11,520
Persuade and force him to keep making the series, or

317
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,170
how long is the suspension going to last?

318
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:16,480
Or come up with a solution even if it means ending the series.

319
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:22,040
Well, It's difficult to find as prestigious an artist as Baek Eo Jin right away.

320
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:23,490
Prestige is not the issue.

321
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:26,330
The sales are the problem, man.

322
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:27,840
"Man"?

323
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:31,200
Our esteemed Team Leader Jang Man Cheol

324
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:35,000
got fired from Ginger Toon for being so laid back.

325
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,700
Have you still not come to your senses yet?

326
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:40,770
- You punk!
 - What are you doing?

327
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:52,660
Director Heo Kwan Yeong. Let's take it easy.

328
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:55,240
Team Leader Jang Man Cheol still has one year left.

329
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:59,110
If you pick on him like that already, what will you do going forward?

330
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:00,880
Yes, I understand.

331
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:10,970
Geez, s**t...

332
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:17,300
 Little Cart Bar 

333
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:39,880
When I came to Neon,

334
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:42,960
I didn't want to repeat what happened at Ginger Toon,

335
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,950
so I avoided many things.

336
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,920
Even though I know I shouldn't have.

337
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:52,810
I'm sorry. I...

338
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:55,240
should've taken care of it sooner.

339
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:58,110
It's not just your fault.

340
00:22:02,650 --> 00:22:06,540
I turned a blind eye even though I noticed it early on.

341
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:16,780
I've been curious for a while.

342
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:18,550
Why did you follow me here?

343
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:21,680
You got many offers from other companies back then.

344
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:22,870
Hyeong, you knew about that?

345
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:25,560
How can I not know, man?

346
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:27,600
If you knew, you should've treated me better.

347
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,810
I did treat you well.

348
00:22:29,810 --> 00:22:33,470
- How can I treat you better than this?
 - Geez...

349
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:36,220
I mean...

350
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:38,530
I just...

351
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:42,910
I just followed you because you are a fan of the "Monsters."

352
00:22:43,610 --> 00:22:45,330
- What?
 - Well, you know

353
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:49,680
Monsters fans don't backstab.

354
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:52,610
You never went to play baseball in the fall for ten years

355
00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:54,620
and you ranked last place when you did play.

356
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:57,190
But you never changed your team.

357
00:22:57,190 --> 00:23:00,530
How should I say this? With loyalty and faith

358
00:23:00,530 --> 00:23:02,340
curled up tight.

359
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:03,880
A Monsters fan.

360
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,070
Right?

361
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:08,570
Monsters' fans never backstab, right?

362
00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:10,460
Monsters!

363
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:11,500
Monsters!

364
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:15,200
Go, Monsters!

365
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,820
Yes, it's Gu Jun Yeong.

366
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:29,100
 PD Gu, are you done with everything on your schedule? 

367
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:30,710
Yes, I'm done.

368
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:33,900
I want to say, "You must be tired, so go home and rest," but

369
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:37,060
you have to stop by one more place.

370
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:39,550
Where is it?

371
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:40,990
You know Artist Pomme, right?

372
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:43,430
She asked for us to come to her studio quickly.

373
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:45,160
 I just sent you her address. 

374
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:47,330
 Thanks for the favor, PD Gu. 

375
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,020
What the heck?

376
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:53,830
Aren't you delegating too much work to someone else?

377
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:56,930
It's all right. It's okay to do that as a new hire.

378
00:23:56,930 --> 00:23:58,470
Huh?

379
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:03,340
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

380
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:08,930
 One, two, three, for you! 

381
00:24:08,930 --> 00:24:10,810
Our Ji Ho is doing great, right?

382
00:24:10,810 --> 00:24:12,080
Doing the wave. Like this...

383
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,780
Like this?

384
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:45,620
 He came. 

385
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:48,000
 Can I borrow your umbrella? 

386
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,460
 Then... 

387
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:51,800
 can I come closer? 

388
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:57,390
Artist Pomme?

389
00:24:57,390 --> 00:25:01,070
Oh, are you the new hire that PD Kwon sent?

390
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:03,630
 Her words are short (using honorifics makes your words longer). 

391
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,210
I'm glad you are tall.

392
00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:16,760
- What?
 - This way, please.

393
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:28,150
This keeps blinking.

394
00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:30,300
The bulbs are out, so I can't do my work.

395
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:31,480
You're right.

396
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:32,980
Did you call someone?

397
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:35,420
I did call someone.

398
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:37,130
Me?

399
00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:38,780
Don't you know how to change a light bulb?

400
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:41,870
Calling your PD at this hour for your personal needs.

401
00:25:41,870 --> 00:25:43,480
Isn't that power tripping?

402
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:45,290
Is it?

403
00:25:45,290 --> 00:25:46,590
No, it's not.

404
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:48,380
This is a request.

405
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:52,220
Actual power tripping is missing my deadlines and telling your editor

406
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:56,030
that I couldn't work because of a newbie PD.

407
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:42,910
Try turning on the switch.

408
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,910
It works.

409
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:50,890
You are more useful than I thought.

410
00:26:57,290 --> 00:26:59,130
Thank you.

411
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:04,420
I think I can meet the deadline without problems, thanks to you.

412
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:05,320
Right.

413
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:06,960
Ah yes.  All right then.

414
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,780
Bye now.

415
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:10,910
What's your name?

416
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:13,300
Why the hell do you want to know?

417
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:14,510
How old are you?

418
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:16,760
- Excuse me?
 - You think you're all that because you're an artist?

419
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:21,640
I'm Gu Jun Yeong.

420
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:25,160
I see. Gu Jun Yeong.

421
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:28,120
I'll see you often going forward.

422
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:53,130
You think a webtoon PD is your personal manager?

423
00:27:55,070 --> 00:27:58,600
 There are few artists who treat a PD as their personal manager. 

424
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:03,510
I heard most artists don't want to be bothered by the PDs these days. No?

425
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:06,060
Artist Pomme is a special case.

426
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:06,930
Why?

427
00:28:06,930 --> 00:28:09,780
She was at her prime when she was 20, and she's still doing well.

428
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:15,100
Her family catered to her too much and she just got used to all that.

429
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:19,690
Artist Pomme brings in a lot of money to our company.

430
00:28:19,690 --> 00:28:23,050
When Neon Webtoon launched, they put a lot of work into signing

431
00:28:23,050 --> 00:28:26,590
Na Gang Nam, Baek Eo Jin, and Pomme. These three.

432
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:29,600
And you can say that these three bring in more than half the revenue.

433
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:33,660
She probably knows that herself and she was accustomed to power tripping.

434
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:36,180
Gosh, changing the light bulbs is nothing.

435
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:37,800
At least she didn't ask you to plunge her toilet.

436
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:40,140
Geez! We are eating.

437
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:42,310
There are people like that.

438
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:43,930
- Really?
 - There are.

439
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:46,160
That's crazy!

440
00:28:55,170 --> 00:28:58,620
They definitely said this cat litter dissolves in water

441
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:01,130
but when I tried to flush it, it got stuck.

442
00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:03,700
Did I put too much?

443
00:29:10,730 --> 00:29:13,100
 Pop 

444
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:17,740
Lee Eun Yeong

445
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:21,050
On Ma Eum

446
00:29:36,670 --> 00:29:37,980
I lost again.

447
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:40,740
When will I beat On Ma Eum...

448
00:29:44,270 --> 00:29:48,400
Did you tell your dad about becoming a PD?

449
00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:53,480
No.

450
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:58,730
So you are really going to quit judo?

451
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:02,880
Why?

452
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,240
Because of that incident?

453
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:07,890
No.

454
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:10,010
Just because.

455
00:30:10,010 --> 00:30:12,140
I've done enough.

456
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:16,550
I gave it my heart and soul. Also, my entire body.

457
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:20,480
I want to use that energy for something else now.

458
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:24,070
Somewhere that is kinder to me.

459
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:25,700
How are the webtoons going?

460
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:27,160
I like it.

461
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:30,270
I like webtoon as much as judo.

462
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:38,830
Success for me and others... 
 Gentleness beats harshness, Use one's power in a righteous cause, Success for me and others 

463
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,110
What are you doing? Aren't you leaving?

464
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:45,030
It's been a while since I saw this.

465
00:30:45,030 --> 00:30:46,950
Was this always tilted forward like this?

466
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:48,660
Yeah.

467
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:50,140
Really? Why?

468
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:51,470
Because it's hanging high.

469
00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:53,510
We have to look up like this

470
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:56,320
so it's straight to the eyes when it's tilted forward.

471
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,100
Stupid.

472
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:00,100
I see.

473
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:02,670
I'm home.

474
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:06,880
What are you watching?

475
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:07,890
Documentary.

476
00:31:07,890 --> 00:31:09,600
A documentary on Michelangelo.

477
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,580
- Why suddenly? Michelangelo?
  - Michaelangelo... 

478
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:15,510
I'm vacationing in Italy with my high school friends.

479
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:16,460
So I am going to study.

480
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:18,500
That's cool, Mom.

481
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:20,750
 Michelangelo's David statue... 

482
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:23,600
 If you look at the status from the same eye level, 

483
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:26,360
 the body proportion is off. 

484
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:28,760
 Big head, long arms, 

485
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:31,650
 and abnormally large hands and feet. 

486
00:31:31,650 --> 00:31:33,480
 Did the master make a mistake? 

487
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:37,360
 This was all intentionally planned by Michelangelo. 

488
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:41,000
 Because if you look up at the David statue from below, 

489
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,020
 in order for it to be seen with heavenly proportion. 

490
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:44,440
 - Because it's hanging high.
- So he intentionally... 

491
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:47,640
 It's straight to the eyes when it's tilted forward. 

492
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:53,710
Isn't that amazing?

493
00:31:54,930 --> 00:31:56,800
Mom!

494
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:59,110
- Ow, ow, ow!
 - Mom, Mom!

495
00:31:59,110 --> 00:32:02,220
- What's with you?
 - I love you!

496
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:04,140
I love you, Mom!

497
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:06,410
What's wrong with her?

498
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:23,900
- Yeah, what's up?
 - Sorry to bother you on the weekend, Deputy Editor.

499
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,890
Can I meet you right now?

500
00:32:25,890 --> 00:32:28,260
- Right now?
- Yes!

501
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:04,850
Honey?

502
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:10,270
I shouldn't show my ugly side anymore.

503
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:14,540
I think stepping down seems to be the right move.

504
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:18,890
Mr. Baek Eo Jin?

505
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:25,260
I sincerely apologize.

506
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:30,550
Why are you apologizing?

507
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:33,940
There's no reason for you to feel apologetic.

508
00:33:47,070 --> 00:33:52,450
Our entire editorial team solely relied on you this whole time.

509
00:33:52,450 --> 00:33:58,490
Even without our assistance, you created amazing series all by yourself.

510
00:33:58,490 --> 00:34:02,210
I think we took that for granted.

511
00:34:02,210 --> 00:34:07,220
Then when you actually needed help, we couldn't do anything to help.

512
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:10,840
I'm sorry, but getting help from you

513
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:14,860
or discussing things has never crossed my mind.

514
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:21,320
I saw way too many artists vanish after relying on their editors.

515
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:24,110
If your help is a must for my work,

516
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:28,700
that itself means it's a reason I should retire.

517
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:30,940
Artist Baek, your drawings...

518
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:35,800
I mean, your comic drawings are not sagging.

519
00:34:36,530 --> 00:34:37,610
Hey!

520
00:34:37,610 --> 00:34:39,430
There's timing in a conversation!

521
00:34:39,430 --> 00:34:42,870
I think now is that time.

522
00:34:42,870 --> 00:34:45,050
What are you talking about?

523
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:51,040
Please excuse me for saying this, but your back is hunched a lot right now.

524
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,880
But...

525
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:57,150
you weren't before.

526
00:34:57,150 --> 00:35:01,880
You have used the same tools since then the same way.

527
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:04,750
The angle of the drawing board is the same as before.

528
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:07,200
But now, you've aged and

529
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:10,200
in the process, your core muscles...

530
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:12,190
So, that's the abdomen,

531
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:14,750
waist, and back muscles became weaker.

532
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:17,860
So your posture is hunched.

533
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:34,150
Your current eye level is very different than when you were young.

534
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:39,840
 Even when you are drawing the same thing, 

535
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,970
 if you are drawing from a different angle, 

536
00:35:41,970 --> 00:35:44,430
 that can produce different drawings. 

537
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:53,620
So...

538
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:56,480
even the drawings that look like they're sagging,

539
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:02,530
if you look at it from your angle, sir...

540
00:36:02,530 --> 00:36:04,110
This much, more like this...

541
00:36:04,110 --> 00:36:05,860
Like this?

542
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:13,830
It was identical to your past drawings that looked balanced.

543
00:36:13,830 --> 00:36:16,540
 Your drawings weren't unbalanced. 

544
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:20,510
The angle you were drawing from was off.

545
00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:23,580
Yes, so when you are drawing, sir,

546
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:26,170
if being hunched over was the issue,

547
00:36:26,170 --> 00:36:27,930
you can adjust the drawing board angle

548
00:36:27,930 --> 00:36:31,450
and if you can draw from the frontal view...

549
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:35,690
Then...

550
00:36:36,650 --> 00:36:38,840
I can...

551
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:42,170
draw webtoons that I'm not embarrassed about?

552
00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:44,450
Yes, that is right.

553
00:36:50,410 --> 00:36:51,680
Honey?

554
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:54,460
You have more guests.

555
00:36:59,090 --> 00:37:01,570
Hey, what brings all of you here?

556
00:37:01,570 --> 00:37:03,020
Who are they?

557
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:04,510
They are his former assistants.

558
00:37:04,510 --> 00:37:07,180
Of course, they are all active artists now.

559
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:10,860
We came after hearing that your assistant ran away.

560
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:15,550
Let's create your manuscripts together again.

561
00:37:15,550 --> 00:37:18,840
I came because I was so curious about what happens in the "Dragon's Dream."

562
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,860
We will do our best and assist you.

563
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:24,360
We will help you get back to the series quickly.

564
00:37:26,850 --> 00:37:28,870
What about your work?

565
00:37:28,870 --> 00:37:31,430
You guys have projects in progress.

566
00:37:31,430 --> 00:37:32,600
Don't worry.

567
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:35,560
You told us to save at least three weeks' worth for the weekly series.

568
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:37,340
We all saved enough, right?

569
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:39,080
Of course.

570
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:43,160
We all learned from you, Teacher.

571
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:47,610
From drawing to living the rest of our life as comic artists.

572
00:38:06,310 --> 00:38:08,100
All right.

573
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:09,010
Let's draw.

574
00:38:09,010 --> 00:38:11,110
Yes!

575
00:38:14,610 --> 00:38:17,150
Let's get started.

576
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:23,880
- On Ma Eum.
 - Yes?

577
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:30,520
Do you remember I said I don't know what Team Leader saw in you?

578
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:32,100
Yes.

579
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:36,600
♫  When I suddenly lose my footing, grab me. You know everything.  ♫

580
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:39,810
I still don't know what he saw in you, but

581
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:44,270
you did great today. 
 ♫  Of all things ignore a rough relationship  ♫

582
00:38:44,270 --> 00:38:46,250
- Really?
 - Yeah.

583
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:48,210
You did really well.

584
00:38:48,210 --> 00:38:50,990
Then, are you buying me dinner tonight?

585
00:38:50,990 --> 00:38:53,160
What?

586
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:54,790
Somehow, I think you can eat a lot.

587
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:57,390
Yes, I eat tons. Really.

588
00:38:57,390 --> 00:38:59,600
Then can I eat something expensive?

589
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:02,700
♫  Couldn't we see it again?  The child I longed for  ♫

590
00:39:02,730 --> 00:39:04,630
♫  There isn't anything which can force me.  ♫

591
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:06,880
I pick the restaurant and the menu.

592
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:09,400
- You got it? 
 - Yes.

593
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,560
♫  The crisis faces me now and I feel like everything will crash  ♫

594
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:13,870
Wait a minute.

595
00:39:13,870 --> 00:39:15,530
Where did I park my car again?

596
00:39:15,530 --> 00:39:17,420
In front of the artist's house.

597
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:18,730
Oh, yeah?

598
00:39:20,510 --> 00:39:22,910
I'm going to eat a lot.

599
00:39:22,910 --> 00:39:25,380
♫  Whoa, whoa, whoa, think about it  ♫

600
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:29,240
♫  I think you'll smile brightly  ♫

601
00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:37,640
 On Ma Eum 

602
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:50,290
Can't you trust me, Dad?

603
00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:09,500
Artist Baek Eo Jin is back.

604
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:13,910
That artist who drew a dragon-something for 30 years?

605
00:40:13,910 --> 00:40:16,790
Yeah, isn't he amazing?

606
00:40:16,790 --> 00:40:18,460
As expected.

607
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:27,500
Hey.

608
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:29,250
Suspension for the Dragon's Dream is over.

609
00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:31,460
The artist wasn't terminally ill?

610
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:34,860
He's not going to die until Dragon's Dream is over.

611
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:41,390
How is it? Is it fun?

612
00:40:41,390 --> 00:40:42,550
What?

613
00:40:42,550 --> 00:40:45,020
Aren't you reading today's episode of "Dragon's Dream"? Is it fun?

614
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:46,250
Oh, yes.

615
00:40:46,250 --> 00:40:47,590
It's really good!

616
00:40:47,590 --> 00:40:48,870
Super fun!

617
00:40:48,870 --> 00:40:50,250
It's fun?

618
00:40:50,250 --> 00:40:53,370
- You want to read it together? 
- No, no!

619
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:05,040
Dragon resurrected!

620
00:41:07,470 --> 00:41:10,100
And it's perfect too.

621
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:18,880
 The dragon resurrected! 

622
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:21,390
 Artist Baek, you are not going anywhere now, right? 

623
00:41:21,390 --> 00:41:24,740
 Please stay healthy until you complete the series. 

624
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:27,570
 Please send me your address. I will send you herbal medicines. 

625
00:41:27,570 --> 00:41:31,790
 Artist Baek, I read "Dragon's Dream" whenever I feel depressed or suicidal. 

626
00:41:31,790 --> 00:41:35,870
 That makes me want to live one more week because I'm curious about what happens to the story. 

627
00:41:35,870 --> 00:41:37,980
 So, please continue the series for a long, long time. 

628
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:40,250
 I love you, Artist Baek. 

629
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:49,210
Elder!

630
00:41:49,210 --> 00:41:51,920
There's been a tremendous change.

631
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:55,970
Thanks to this incident I want to challenge myself again.

632
00:41:55,970 --> 00:42:00,090
My hoobaes are quarreling, wanting to teach me.

633
00:42:01,130 --> 00:42:04,410
I can't apply much pressure to the pen, so expressing different strokes is

634
00:42:04,410 --> 00:42:06,440
my essential issue here.

635
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:11,140
I still have many messages I want to convey to the world.

636
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:13,170
I can't let my age defeat me.

637
00:42:13,170 --> 00:42:15,980
Yes. Of course not. You can't.

638
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:19,610
From now on, I will discuss all kinds of things with you.

639
00:42:19,610 --> 00:42:20,950
So I am counting on you.

640
00:42:20,950 --> 00:42:22,730
Gosh. No, sir!

641
00:42:22,730 --> 00:42:25,420
I thank you in advance, sir!

642
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:31,630
I sincerely thank you, sir.

643
00:42:35,270 --> 00:42:36,800
Hey, Mandu  (dumpling – referring to her ears). 

644
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,250
You really...

645
00:42:38,250 --> 00:42:40,910
You did really great. So great! Really.

646
00:42:40,910 --> 00:42:42,440
Really great.

647
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:44,820
- Just keep at it. 
- Yes, sir!

648
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:49,120
If I keep working hard like this, can I continue working here?

649
00:42:52,190 --> 00:42:53,870
Yes. Yes, of course, you must.

650
00:42:53,870 --> 00:42:57,130
You're working so hard. Of course, that should happen.

651
00:42:57,130 --> 00:42:58,720
I'll give you a cash gift...

652
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:00,190
No, I will work hard.

653
00:43:00,190 --> 00:43:03,240
- Hey. Fighting!
 - Fighting!

654
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:04,470
Fighting!

655
00:43:04,470 --> 00:43:06,880
Gosh, I picked the right person.

656
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:09,100
I picked so well!

657
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:26,920
 I'm sorry, but no matter how hard you work, 

658
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:29,680
 you can't become a full-time employee. 

659
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:31,930
 This team won't exist next year. 

660
00:43:33,150 --> 00:43:35,660
Cheers!

661
00:43:37,030 --> 00:43:38,910
So nice...

662
00:43:41,070 --> 00:43:42,810
You don't have to turn your head. Just drink comfortably.
Younger people turn their head when drinking

663
00:43:42,810 --> 00:43:44,250
Gosh, no.

664
00:43:44,250 --> 00:43:46,440
Anyway, isn't PD Kwon Yeong Bae joining us today?

665
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:47,880
He typically doesn't join staff dinners.

666
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:49,380
He's a work-and-life balance fairy,

667
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:52,200
so unless he's on night duty, he gets off work on time.

668
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:56,420
Seonbae-nim.

669
00:43:56,420 --> 00:43:57,900
Here.

670
00:43:58,540 --> 00:44:00,760
I can't drink.

671
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:01,880
You are al-ssu (someone who can't drink)?

672
00:44:02,470 --> 00:44:04,470
This is the first for me.

673
00:44:04,470 --> 00:44:06,890
Can't believe we have an al-ssu in our team.

674
00:44:10,170 --> 00:44:12,170
I also look forward to working with you.

675
00:44:12,170 --> 00:44:15,120
No, no, if you pour like that...

676
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:21,410
Jun Yeong.

677
00:44:21,410 --> 00:44:23,040
Do you have a problem with me?

678
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:24,110
No, it's not that.

679
00:44:24,110 --> 00:44:25,990
I'll pour for you.

680
00:44:25,990 --> 00:44:28,480
The master is here. With this...

681
00:44:29,570 --> 00:44:31,770
That's right.

682
00:44:31,770 --> 00:44:33,990
Look at that glass tilt.

683
00:44:33,990 --> 00:44:35,930
She's got the right angle.

684
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:40,140
Wow, perfect pour.

685
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:43,000
2:8 ratio. I poured you a golden ratio.

686
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,410
Wow, you know how to pour beer, Ma Eum.

687
00:44:45,410 --> 00:44:46,580
- Should we toast?
 - Cheers!

688
00:44:46,580 --> 00:44:49,440
Cheers!

689
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:00,220
Daebak!

690
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:04,670
I never saw anyone drink beer faster than PD Choi.

691
00:45:05,590 --> 00:45:08,610
I was famous since my Athlete's Village days for drinking beer fast.

692
00:45:08,610 --> 00:45:10,290
You know, when I'd be physically drained,

693
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:14,030
after drinking a can of beer, I'd be recharged and jump up immediately.

694
00:45:14,030 --> 00:45:16,100
That's amazing!

695
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:18,750
PD On, let's drink one more glass together.

696
00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:20,520
- One more glass.
 - Okay.

697
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:22,870
Wow, a drinker was too far away.

698
00:45:22,870 --> 00:45:25,610
Wow, you are too strong.

699
00:45:25,610 --> 00:45:28,440
I'm glad I picked her.

700
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:30,780
Gu Jun Yeong.

701
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:33,280
- Staff dinner is boring for you, huh?
 - Yes.

702
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:36,320
I mean, no. It's fun.

703
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:39,230
He's honest. So honest.

704
00:45:40,180 --> 00:45:41,700
Cheers.

705
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:44,340
Jun Yeong, you said you can't drink.

706
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:45,840
I'm sure he's okay with one glass.

707
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:48,640
- It's okay.
 - Drink more then.

708
00:45:51,620 --> 00:45:53,470
I'm good.

709
00:45:55,330 --> 00:45:56,430
Whoa! 
 Bang / Whoa! 

710
00:45:56,430 --> 00:45:57,140
 Is this for real? 

711
00:45:57,140 --> 00:45:59,510
 Why... what? 

712
00:45:59,510 --> 00:46:00,930
I guess he is not okay.

713
00:46:00,930 --> 00:46:03,580
It's okay. It's okay. Hey, don't mind him.

714
00:46:03,580 --> 00:46:06,740
He will be okay after taking a nap.

715
00:46:06,740 --> 00:46:08,200
He's not dead. PD Gi, sit down.

716
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:08,890
Should we make a toast?

717
00:46:08,890 --> 00:46:09,820
Cheers!

718
00:46:09,820 --> 00:46:11,600
- Cheers!
 - Jun Yeong!

719
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:12,700
- Jun Yeong!
- Please pour me a glass.

720
00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:14,170
Are you okay?

721
00:46:14,170 --> 00:46:15,940
- Is this real or what?
 - Thank you!

722
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:17,860
- No holding back.
 - Drink slowly.

723
00:46:17,860 --> 00:46:20,350
Stop. We just got started...

724
00:46:20,350 --> 00:46:21,400
It's sweet. So sweet.

725
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:23,470
I'm in big trouble today. What to do!

726
00:46:23,470 --> 00:46:25,240
- This is crazy.
 - You can't go home.
 - I can't go home!

727
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:29,880
The new hires are complete opposites.

728
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:31,790
Take it easy.

729
00:46:31,790 --> 00:46:33,440
Thank you.

730
00:46:34,210 --> 00:46:35,680
Let's go now.

731
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:37,830
We ate as much as we could. Let's go.

732
00:46:37,830 --> 00:46:39,810
Hey, what are we going to do with him?

733
00:46:39,810 --> 00:46:41,540
Come on.

734
00:46:41,540 --> 00:46:42,850
Get up.

735
00:46:42,850 --> 00:46:43,850
Do you know where he lives?

736
00:46:43,850 --> 00:46:45,620
No, I don't know. But for now...

737
00:46:45,620 --> 00:46:47,890
- He is so— 
- I will take him.

738
00:46:47,890 --> 00:46:50,150
- What? How? Hey! 
- How could Ma Eum...

739
00:46:50,150 --> 00:46:53,040
- How?
 - Right, Ma Eum.

740
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:55,910
Just take care of my bag.

741
00:46:55,910 --> 00:46:56,890
She's doing it.

742
00:46:56,890 --> 00:46:59,330
- She's doing it.
 - There are so many men here.

743
00:46:59,330 --> 00:47:00,370
Let's go, let's go.

744
00:47:00,370 --> 00:47:03,140
- Go, go.
 - Here. Give it to her.

745
00:47:03,140 --> 00:47:04,520
What's she going to do?

746
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:06,350
- Hey.
 - I paid.

747
00:47:06,350 --> 00:47:07,950
- How could she...
 - She's strong. Very strong.

748
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:10,610
- Wow.
 - I picked a good one.

749
00:47:10,610 --> 00:47:13,220
Watch the leg. Be careful.

750
00:47:16,870 --> 00:47:19,310
Are you going to be okay alone?

751
00:47:19,310 --> 00:47:22,780
Don't worry. I'll take him home safely.

752
00:47:22,780 --> 00:47:24,580
Love your coworker and love your country!

753
00:47:24,580 --> 00:47:26,300
It's not about loving coworkers and loving country.

754
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:28,790
Are you really going to be okay?

755
00:47:28,790 --> 00:47:29,990
Thank you.

756
00:47:29,990 --> 00:47:31,390
Done.

757
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:32,800
Bye now!

758
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:35,420
- Get home safely! 
- Wait. Fine!

759
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:38,010
Go, go!

760
00:47:42,190 --> 00:47:44,230
Is this right?

761
00:48:02,610 --> 00:48:06,290
Eonni, who's this hot oppa?

762
00:48:06,290 --> 00:48:07,650
Your boyfriend?

763
00:48:07,650 --> 00:48:10,030
No, a colleague from my team.

764
00:48:10,030 --> 00:48:12,570
Colleague?

765
00:48:12,570 --> 00:48:13,640
Colleague.

766
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:15,930
Who is this handsome thing?

767
00:48:15,930 --> 00:48:18,130
What's with this height and long legs?

768
00:48:18,130 --> 00:48:19,990
The breakfast for tomorrow is bukeoguk (dried pollack soup).

769
00:48:19,990 --> 00:48:21,680
I like it.

770
00:48:24,290 --> 00:48:26,590
Gorgeous.

771
00:48:41,050 --> 00:48:43,320
 Manhwa Cafe, On 

772
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:46,910
Where is this?

773
00:48:57,620 --> 00:48:59,430
Who are you?

774
00:49:08,180 --> 00:49:09,890
I am...

775
00:49:11,780 --> 00:49:13,750
But who are you?

776
00:49:16,460 --> 00:49:18,520
Where is this place?

777
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:20,520
Who the heck is this?

778
00:49:21,390 --> 00:49:23,640
How did you get in, huh?

779
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:26,210
That's what I want to know the most.

780
00:49:26,210 --> 00:49:27,910
What kind of nonsense is that?

781
00:49:27,910 --> 00:49:30,070
- Why are you doing this? 
- This punk!

782
00:49:30,070 --> 00:49:31,460
Crazy. Come here, you punk!

783
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:33,510
You look perfectly fine, yet...

784
00:49:33,510 --> 00:49:35,720
You punk!

785
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:39,140
I'm calling the cops. Let's talk when they get here.

786
00:49:39,140 --> 00:49:40,740
- Honey? 
 - Yes?

787
00:49:40,740 --> 00:49:43,870
How come you already came home at dawn when everyone was asleep?

788
00:49:43,870 --> 00:49:47,190
I'm glad I came early. I caught a thief!

789
00:49:47,190 --> 00:49:48,970
I'm not a thief.

790
00:49:48,970 --> 00:49:51,020
What do you mean you're not? You just wait!

791
00:49:51,020 --> 00:49:53,020
If the two of you were here, you must know.

792
00:49:53,020 --> 00:49:55,820
Why am I here exactly?

793
00:49:55,820 --> 00:49:57,990
That is...

794
00:49:57,990 --> 00:50:00,470
So...

795
00:50:00,470 --> 00:50:02,640
The fact is...

796
00:50:08,010 --> 00:50:09,880
the fact...

797
00:50:11,810 --> 00:50:14,080
The fact is that...

798
00:50:15,110 --> 00:50:17,910
I have no idea what's going on here.

799
00:50:17,910 --> 00:50:21,500
What's a fine man like him doing here?

800
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:22,740
See?

801
00:50:22,740 --> 00:50:24,680
You punk!

802
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:26,810
Who are you? Are you a pervert or a freak?

803
00:50:26,810 --> 00:50:28,110
Are you both?

804
00:50:28,110 --> 00:50:31,190
Come on now! Who are you?

805
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:35,140
Gosh, Oppa is really going to get hurt, Dad!

806
00:50:35,140 --> 00:50:37,240
Oppa?

807
00:50:39,150 --> 00:50:40,100
No!

808
00:50:40,100 --> 00:50:42,140
Honey!

809
00:50:42,140 --> 00:50:43,990
Honey!

810
00:50:43,990 --> 00:50:46,540
Don't! Honey!

811
00:50:52,790 --> 00:50:54,860
Thank you. 
 Neon Webtoon Artist, Oh Yun, Fan Autograph Signing Event 

812
00:50:54,860 --> 00:50:56,770
Do well in school.

813
00:50:56,770 --> 00:50:58,320
Hello.

814
00:50:58,320 --> 00:50:59,250
Your name?

815
00:50:59,250 --> 00:51:00,930
- It's Park Sae Eun. 
- Sae Eun?

816
00:51:00,930 --> 00:51:04,080
Yes, you are so handsome.

817
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:06,080
I look better in person, right?

818
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:20,180
Were you very shocked this morning?

819
00:51:20,180 --> 00:51:21,870
Yes.

820
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:23,800
What?

821
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:26,410
How do you know that, On Ma Eum?

822
00:51:26,410 --> 00:51:27,410
I'm sorry.

823
00:51:27,410 --> 00:51:31,880
The man who grabbed you by your neck this morning was my dad.

824
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:33,400
What?

825
00:51:34,590 --> 00:51:37,420
Was that your house, Ma Eum?

826
00:51:37,420 --> 00:51:40,000
Then, you should've explained things this morning.

827
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:43,360
I'm sorry. I have a small reason I couldn't.

828
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:45,440
What reason?

829
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:47,660
PD On Ma Eum.

830
00:51:48,700 --> 00:51:50,430
Later.

831
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:55,280
Thank you.

832
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:01,030
PD Choi.

833
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:04,660
I told you I'm busy because of the new series.

834
00:52:04,660 --> 00:52:06,170
I told you not to book anything.

835
00:52:06,170 --> 00:52:09,820
This was scheduled a long time ago and was already publicized, so...

836
00:52:09,820 --> 00:52:14,070
Please bear with us just for today. I'm sorry, sir.

837
00:52:16,870 --> 00:52:18,630
Oh, yes, hello.

838
00:52:18,630 --> 00:52:21,210
It looks like it's pretty much wrapped up, huh?

839
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:24,300
I have to leave early for the movie rights meeting.

840
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:26,860
- Can you two wrap up here?
 - Yes!

841
00:52:26,860 --> 00:52:31,390
And take those cardboard figures to Artist Oh Yun's studio.

842
00:52:31,390 --> 00:52:32,240
Pardon?

843
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:34,670
Artist Oh Yun said he likes them.

844
00:52:34,670 --> 00:52:37,880
Sure. We'll take them to his studio.

845
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:40,580
- Okay.
- Take care.

846
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,870
"We"?

847
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:06,780
♫  Today is calm in the middle, surrounded by empty bottles  ♫

848
00:53:06,780 --> 00:53:10,640
♫  Singing songs of our own  ♫

849
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:17,130
♫  I will take your hands and won't let go, no need to say the words  ♫

850
00:53:17,130 --> 00:53:19,610
♫  'Cause you know, you know, you know.  ♫

851
00:53:19,610 --> 00:53:22,300
♫  I know, I know  ♫

852
00:53:22,990 --> 00:53:27,680
♫  I need you to warm this lonely heart tonight  ♫

853
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:31,770
♫  Baby, that's the way I'll leave the others­  ♫

854
00:53:31,770 --> 00:53:33,540
Hang in there, Jun Yeong. We are almost there.

855
00:53:33,540 --> 00:53:37,900
Cross this bridge, and it's that office over there, right in front.

856
00:53:38,790 --> 00:53:40,160
I know that too.

857
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:43,230
I know, but it's just hard.

858
00:53:43,230 --> 00:53:46,130
♫  I will always be with you, my love  ♫

859
00:53:46,130 --> 00:53:47,750
All right.

860
00:53:47,750 --> 00:53:49,440
When you walk up the stairs,

861
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:53,100
it's easier if you bend your upper body and relax your stomach.

862
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:55,010
Like this. One, two...

863
00:53:55,010 --> 00:53:56,780
Like this. Like this.

864
00:53:56,780 --> 00:53:57,680
Fighting!

865
00:53:57,700 --> 00:54:03,390
♫  It's alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright   ♫

866
00:54:03,390 --> 00:54:07,860
♫  Baby, I will always be with you  ♫

867
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:15,870
♫  It's alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright (baby, baby, baby)  ♫

868
00:54:15,870 --> 00:54:20,560
♫  I will always be with you, My love  ♫

869
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:23,720
♫  Oh darling, I will take your hand  ♫

870
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:27,970
♫  And let you know how much I care for you  ♫

871
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:33,900
♫  I will always be with you, My love  ♫

872
00:54:40,580 --> 00:54:42,840
I will carry this.

873
00:54:45,030 --> 00:54:47,080
Take your time.

874
00:55:08,980 --> 00:55:11,560
Oh, that's so pretty.

875
00:55:13,010 --> 00:55:17,670
I used to wish I'd get to see the sunset on the Han River going home from work.

876
00:55:17,670 --> 00:55:20,850
One of my wishes came true today.

877
00:55:20,850 --> 00:55:23,700
 What a modest wish. 

878
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:34,060
My ear shape is weird, huh?

879
00:55:34,060 --> 00:55:35,700
What?

880
00:55:37,030 --> 00:55:38,680
Yes.

881
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:41,010
It's common for wrestlers or judo athletes.

882
00:55:41,010 --> 00:55:42,940
Because our ears get pressed on the floor daily.

883
00:55:42,940 --> 00:55:46,670
Your ears have weak veins, so they get swollen quickly.

884
00:55:47,940 --> 00:55:49,960
It's like a medal of honor, then.

885
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:50,900
What?

886
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:53,820
A medal of honor that shows your hard work.

887
00:55:53,820 --> 00:55:56,690
Oh, right.

888
00:55:57,870 --> 00:56:00,140
I have a medal of honor too.

889
00:56:00,140 --> 00:56:05,140
A college degree, foreign language test score, and many certificates.

890
00:56:05,140 --> 00:56:10,650
But after I joined our team, I feel like those medals are useless.

891
00:56:10,650 --> 00:56:12,850
So I feel drained.

892
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:18,850
You may feel that at this moment, but

893
00:56:18,850 --> 00:56:22,610
your medals will shine someday soon. Don't you think?

894
00:56:22,610 --> 00:56:24,830
So, hang in there and...

895
00:56:24,830 --> 00:56:26,820
Be strong?

896
00:56:27,430 --> 00:56:29,090
Yes.

897
00:56:29,790 --> 00:56:35,940
On Ma Eum, you say, "Do your best" and "Be strong" quite a lot, I think.

898
00:56:35,940 --> 00:56:37,530
Oh, you are right.

899
00:56:37,530 --> 00:56:40,220
But I don't like those comments.

900
00:56:40,220 --> 00:56:42,990
Comments like "Be strong" and "Do your best"...

901
00:56:42,990 --> 00:56:44,770
It only drains me more when I hear them.

902
00:56:44,770 --> 00:56:47,530
I'm already doing my best, putting in everything I've got.

903
00:56:47,530 --> 00:56:50,160
And you are telling me to be stronger?

904
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:53,190
How much more? How can I?

905
00:56:53,190 --> 00:56:54,820
Makes me feel all twisted inside.

906
00:56:54,820 --> 00:56:56,550
I see.

907
00:56:57,430 --> 00:57:00,900
It could be because I'm simple-minded.

908
00:57:00,900 --> 00:57:06,540
When I'd hear "Be strong," I wanted to thank them in return.

909
00:57:06,540 --> 00:57:08,700
When I used to compete,

910
00:57:08,700 --> 00:57:12,560
I'd hear people shout, "Be strong! Fighting!" Every single one of them.

911
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:17,160
Then, I'd tell myself to give everything I've got and win, no matter what.

912
00:57:17,160 --> 00:57:22,120
I'll win and make those people who cheer for me happy.

913
00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:24,550
I used to think like that.

914
00:57:24,550 --> 00:57:25,970
Maybe that's why.

915
00:57:25,970 --> 00:57:31,240
It became a habit to say to the people around me, "Be strong!"

916
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:36,810
But after hearing your thoughts, I also think you could take it that way.

917
00:57:36,810 --> 00:57:38,810
I'll have to watch myself.

918
00:57:39,420 --> 00:57:41,100
 Next stop is Sacheon. 

919
00:57:41,100 --> 00:57:42,370
 Sacheon station is coming up. 

920
00:57:42,370 --> 00:57:45,160
I need to transfer, so I have to get off over there.

921
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:46,260
I'll go ahead.

922
00:57:46,260 --> 00:57:48,300
Good work today!

923
00:58:07,490 --> 00:58:09,290
Let me have your attention, briefly.

924
00:58:09,910 --> 00:58:11,980
Artist Yu Jin Ah's "Run All Night"...

925
00:58:11,980 --> 00:58:16,910
As of now, it reached over total 100 million views! Applause!

926
00:58:17,970 --> 00:58:20,110
Gosh, enough, enough.

927
00:58:20,110 --> 00:58:21,930
Enough! Enough!

928
00:58:21,930 --> 00:58:23,410
Get back to work.

929
00:58:23,410 --> 00:58:27,500
Now, all of PD Kwon's projects are in the upper rankings.

930
00:58:27,500 --> 00:58:29,880
Wow, he's going to get tons of bonuses at the end of the year.

931
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:30,750
So jealous.

932
00:58:30,750 --> 00:58:33,380
Our ranking has gone up a lot, thanks to "Run All Night."

933
00:58:33,380 --> 00:58:35,690
Other PDs, please press harder.

934
00:58:35,690 --> 00:58:36,430
Yes, sir.

935
00:58:36,430 --> 00:58:37,870
And two newbie PDs.

936
00:58:37,870 --> 00:58:39,040
- Yes?
 - Yes.

937
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:42,580
Each of you will manage one artist starting today.

938
00:58:42,580 --> 00:58:44,130
Really?

939
00:58:44,130 --> 00:58:45,910
Who your artist will be...

940
00:58:45,910 --> 00:58:49,280
Hear it from the Deputy Editor.

941
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:58,900
Which artist am I managing?

942
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:02,190
I am not going to tell you yet.

943
00:59:02,190 --> 00:59:04,870
Is it a new artist?

944
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:08,010
- Wait.
 - Okay.

945
00:59:08,010 --> 00:59:10,480
 Is work that exciting for her? 

946
00:59:12,280 --> 00:59:14,900
 Sorry for the late response, Jun Yeong. 

947
00:59:14,900 --> 00:59:17,040
 I've been busy since it's personnel transfer season. 

948
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:19,100
 I have time tomorrow night, though. 

949
00:59:19,100 --> 00:59:20,410
 What's your request? 

950
00:59:20,410 --> 00:59:23,630
 Are you going to apply for a transfer? 

951
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:26,680
 Let me think about it for now. 

952
00:59:26,680 --> 00:59:30,500
 Seonbae-nim, give me a call when you're less busy. 

953
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:33,490
 Thank you for your concern. 

954
00:59:36,010 --> 00:59:39,870
Jun Yeong, I heard you plunged Artist Pomme's toilet last time.

955
00:59:43,350 --> 00:59:45,620
She was so grateful to you.

956
00:59:45,620 --> 00:59:47,730
Good job, Mr. Toilet Plunger.

957
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:20,590
Did he get mad?

958
01:00:47,650 --> 01:00:50,030
 I heard Gu Jun Yeong is working so hard lately. 

959
01:00:50,030 --> 01:00:52,140
 The rumors are everywhere among the colleagues. 

960
01:00:52,140 --> 01:00:54,130
 I didn't know you were that passionate. 

961
01:00:54,130 --> 01:00:55,970
 I heard you plunged Artist Pomme's toilet. 

962
01:00:55,970 --> 01:00:57,530
 Didn't she pay you extra on the side? 

963
01:00:57,530 --> 01:01:00,240
 I heard she earns 500 million won a month. 

964
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:02,910
 LOL! 

965
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:08,490
You scared me!

966
01:01:08,490 --> 01:01:09,470
What now?

967
01:01:09,470 --> 01:01:12,200
Are you upset because of the toilet incident?

968
01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:14,130
Whoa, I complimented you because

969
01:01:14,130 --> 01:01:16,260
you did something praiseworthy for the first time since you joined our team.

970
01:01:16,260 --> 01:01:17,870
How can you get angry over that?

971
01:01:17,870 --> 01:01:19,690
Your mentality is weaker than I thought.

972
01:01:19,690 --> 01:01:23,250
So many more difficult tasks packed ahead of you.

973
01:01:23,810 --> 01:01:32,030


974
01:01:32,800 --> 01:01:36,200
- One Iced Americano, please.
 - Just a moment.

975
01:01:42,940 --> 01:01:44,630
Make that two, please.

976
01:01:44,630 --> 01:01:46,390
Seonbaenim.

977
01:01:46,390 --> 01:01:50,280
I'm sorry, but I want to apply for a transfer right away.

978
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:52,090
Would that be possible?

979
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:56,090
I think it's a waste of time to stay on this team.

980
01:01:56,090 --> 01:01:58,160
You can't because you were recently assigned to that team.

981
01:01:58,160 --> 01:02:01,030
You can't transfer right away.

982
01:02:01,030 --> 01:02:04,630
- Then I'll resign.
 - No, you can't!

983
01:02:06,700 --> 01:02:10,180
Seonbaenim, I'll visit and speak to you in person.

984
01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:12,070
What are you doing

985
01:02:12,070 --> 01:02:14,360
eavesdropping on my calls?

986
01:02:17,230 --> 01:02:18,240
No...

987
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:21,010
I'm sorry. I wasn't eavesdropping on purpose.

988
01:02:21,010 --> 01:02:23,620
Yes, well, um...

989
01:02:23,620 --> 01:02:25,500
But it's not true, right?

990
01:02:25,500 --> 01:02:27,690
- About what?
 - Resigning.

991
01:02:27,690 --> 01:02:30,120
- You are not going to, are you?
 - I will.

992
01:02:30,120 --> 01:02:32,040
If he can't accept my transfer request.

993
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:33,330
Why?

994
01:02:33,330 --> 01:02:35,440
Are you asking because you don't know?

995
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:38,290
But still...

996
01:02:38,290 --> 01:02:42,070
Your time and effort spent trying to get into Neon will become a waste, Jun Yeong.

997
01:02:42,070 --> 01:02:45,560
Don't do that. If you endure and be strong...

998
01:02:48,630 --> 01:02:50,210
Let's stop being strong.

999
01:02:50,210 --> 01:02:52,450
Let's stop working so hard.

1000
01:02:52,450 --> 01:02:55,130
How can I work even harder?

1001
01:02:55,130 --> 01:02:57,690
Stop working so hard, too, On Ma Eum.

1002
01:02:57,690 --> 01:02:58,520
What?

1003
01:02:58,520 --> 01:03:01,790
There's no need to work hard and struggle to become a full-time employee.

1004
01:03:01,790 --> 01:03:04,690
This team will be gone next year anyway.

1005
01:03:05,360 --> 01:03:06,490
What?

1006
01:03:06,490 --> 01:03:11,980
Editor-in-Chief Jang Man Cheol and his staff will probably be laid off at the end of the year

1007
01:03:11,980 --> 01:03:13,210
because of poor performance.

1008
01:03:13,210 --> 01:03:14,800
♫  Where is this?  ♫

1009
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:18,820
They said they will hire you as a full-time employee if you work hard.

1010
01:03:18,820 --> 01:03:21,060
They cheated you, Ms. On Ma Eum.

1011
01:03:21,060 --> 01:03:23,750
They plan to get rid of you after using you as a contractor for a year.

1012
01:03:23,750 --> 01:03:27,810
So, find your way, On Ma Eum.

1013
01:03:27,810 --> 01:03:31,770
Don't waste your precious year with tortured false hope.

1014
01:03:31,770 --> 01:03:33,590
♫  Take a trip  ♫

1015
01:03:33,590 --> 01:03:37,240
♫  At the moment the darkness clears  ♫

1016
01:03:37,240 --> 01:03:43,370
♫  in the warm wind full of sunshine  ♫

1017
01:03:43,370 --> 01:03:48,240
♫  For myself I will open the wings which were folded  ♫

1018
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:51,680
♫  Higher, get up higher  ♫

1019
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:56,360
♫  Fly soar fly in the sky  ♫

1020
01:03:56,360 --> 01:04:01,340
♫  Stretch your hands and reach for the light  ♫

1021
01:04:01,340 --> 01:04:05,960
♫  Will you take me with you?  ♫

1022
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:11,100
♫  Follow the dispersing&nbsp;light  ♫

1023
01:04:11,150 --> 01:04:13,420
♫  I fly  ♫

1024
01:04:13,420 --> 01:04:16,440
 Today's Webtoon 

1025
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:19,440
 I will need some luck from now on. 

1026
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:21,410
 You two have assigned artists. 

1027
01:04:21,410 --> 01:04:23,710
 Whoa, crazy! 

1028
01:04:24,470 --> 01:04:25,920
 Is this why you called me? 

1029
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:27,670
 I called you because I wanted to see you. 

1030
01:04:27,670 --> 01:04:31,400
 What is a true editor? 

1031
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:37,070
 The suffering of the artist is proportional to the joy of the reader. 

1032
01:04:37,720 --> 01:04:39,970
 Out of all teams, why do you think we assigned you to that team? 

1033
01:04:39,970 --> 01:04:41,590
 You must take really good care of him. 

1034
01:04:41,590 --> 01:04:43,630
 Artist Na Gang Nam's deadline... 

1035
01:04:43,630 --> 01:04:44,560
 Just suspend it! 

1036
01:04:44,560 --> 01:04:46,850
 By chance, did the manuscript arrive yet? 

1037
01:04:46,850 --> 01:04:50,370
 Hey, are you kidding me? 

1038
01:04:50,370 --> 01:04:55,230
♫  Fly soar fly in the sky  ♫
