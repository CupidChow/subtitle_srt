1
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:10,900


2
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:34,090
 Today's Webtoon 

3
00:00:38,961 --> 00:00:41,121
I used to hate comics.

4
00:00:42,201 --> 00:00:44,991
When my noona was alive,

5
00:00:44,991 --> 00:00:51,561
I hated it because it felt like child's play compared to my reality.

6
00:00:51,561 --> 00:00:53,961
After my noona passed away,

7
00:00:54,941 --> 00:00:57,521
it reminded me of her too much.

8
00:00:59,251 --> 00:01:01,981
I think I always wanted to run away.

9
00:01:02,961 --> 00:01:06,280
I kept running away.  Why, of all places,

10
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:08,880
did I arrive here at the place I was running away from?

11
00:01:12,921 --> 00:01:15,541
"You will not arrive in paradise when you run away."

12
00:01:17,101 --> 00:01:22,371
The quote from that comic keeps popping up for some reason.

13
00:01:42,441 --> 00:01:49,641
 Episode 12: No one is courageous.  There are only those who muster courage ... 

14
00:01:53,991 --> 00:01:57,651
I want to tell him that he didn't run away.

15
00:02:07,461 --> 00:02:11,811
Is it... a little too much pressure?

16
00:02:26,011 --> 00:02:28,561
 I did that to my noona. 

17
00:02:28,561 --> 00:02:31,761
 Because of me, Noona ... 

18
00:02:31,761 --> 00:02:33,851
 It's okay. 

19
00:02:37,381 --> 00:02:39,191
 It's okay. 

20
00:03:01,161 --> 00:03:03,101
- What ar— 
 - Oh, my God!

21
00:03:03,101 --> 00:03:04,171
What is it?

22
00:03:04,171 --> 00:03:05,931
What were you doing to be this startled?

23
00:03:05,931 --> 00:03:07,221
What is it?

24
00:03:07,221 --> 00:03:09,241
It's just ...

25
00:03:11,021 --> 00:03:13,001
 "Run awayyy" 

26
00:03:13,001 --> 00:03:15,301
- Oh, man.
 - What is it?

27
00:03:19,331 --> 00:03:22,041
- On Nu Ri, you!
 - Why, why, why?

28
00:03:22,041 --> 00:03:25,931
I told you not to bother me when I'm in there!

29
00:03:31,001 --> 00:03:33,151
"Run... awayyy?"

30
00:03:33,151 --> 00:03:35,671
What the hell? Did you go mad again?

31
00:03:35,671 --> 00:03:36,691
Why, why, why?

32
00:03:36,691 --> 00:03:39,201
He's calling me now!

33
00:03:42,551 --> 00:03:44,481
 Gu Jun Yeong 

34
00:03:44,481 --> 00:03:46,984
Hey, you were awake?

35
00:03:46,984 --> 00:03:49,494
Yeah. I couldn't sleep.

36
00:03:49,494 --> 00:03:51,531
- Who is it? 
  -  The text... 

37
00:03:51,531 --> 00:03:55,401
Oh, I-I sent it by mistake. Don't mind it.

38
00:03:56,741 --> 00:03:58,571
Makes me wonder quite a bit.

39
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:00,671
Sorry?

40
00:04:00,671 --> 00:04:02,391
It's nothing.

41
00:04:04,731 --> 00:04:06,001
Okay.

42
00:04:07,701 --> 00:04:10,281
I'll see you at the office.

43
00:04:10,281 --> 00:04:12,071
Okay.

44
00:04:12,071 --> 00:04:14,221
See you at the office.

45
00:04:18,551 --> 00:04:20,011
What is it?

46
00:04:20,011 --> 00:04:21,461
Your coworker?

47
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:24,921
Are you two now calling each other outside of work? How did it happen?

48
00:04:24,921 --> 00:04:29,531
Hey, it's not a big deal for coworkers to call each other and stuff.

49
00:04:51,661 --> 00:04:53,381
What? Why?

50
00:04:58,521 --> 00:05:01,931
- How are you? 
 - Good morning.

51
00:05:03,331 --> 00:05:05,391
Good to see you.

52
00:05:10,481 --> 00:05:11,821
Good morning.

53
00:05:11,821 --> 00:05:13,671
You're back, Jun Yeong.

54
00:05:13,671 --> 00:05:14,801
Yes.

55
00:05:14,801 --> 00:05:16,901
Did you rest well? Did you get taller?

56
00:05:16,901 --> 00:05:18,951
I'm sorry for vanishing all of a sudden.

57
00:05:18,951 --> 00:05:20,531
Sorry for what?

58
00:05:20,531 --> 00:05:23,551
Recharging is the purpose of a vacation.

59
00:05:23,551 --> 00:05:26,941
We've got to give it to you, the work-life balance fairy.

60
00:05:36,301 --> 00:05:41,001
 Director Heo is moving toward taking over Young Toon. 

61
00:05:41,001 --> 00:05:46,441
I know you don't have enough time to produce any meaningful results.

62
00:05:46,441 --> 00:05:49,121
However, if you bring me a solution,

63
00:05:49,121 --> 00:05:53,001
then win by using everything Neon has to offer at your disposal...

64
00:05:53,711 --> 00:05:57,931
That's the only way for me to help you.

65
00:05:57,931 --> 00:06:02,751
"Everything Neon... has to offer?"

66
00:06:17,841 --> 00:06:19,941
- Good morning. 
 -  You're here. 

67
00:06:19,941 --> 00:06:21,871
Hello.

68
00:06:32,921 --> 00:06:35,191
Everyone.

69
00:06:35,191 --> 00:06:37,971
Shall we have a brief meeting this morning?

70
00:06:41,471 --> 00:06:44,911
Please begin the meeting now.

71
00:06:46,601 --> 00:06:51,631
Director Heo Kwan Yeong is promoting the acquisition of Young Toon.

72
00:06:53,271 --> 00:06:56,131
I'm sure some of you guessed that we're at risk,

73
00:06:56,131 --> 00:06:58,831
but probably no one knew that it was to this degree.

74
00:06:58,831 --> 00:07:01,371
I did hear it recently as well.

75
00:07:02,701 --> 00:07:06,121
I thought that we'd still have at least half a year,

76
00:07:06,121 --> 00:07:11,851
but the time we have left now is only three months.

77
00:07:13,611 --> 00:07:16,051
This bad feeling is not so unfamiliar.

78
00:07:16,051 --> 00:07:18,731
With Director Heo stepping forward as well.

79
00:07:19,381 --> 00:07:20,921
Why?

80
00:07:21,631 --> 00:07:23,581
He's right.

81
00:07:25,561 --> 00:07:29,881
Yes. It's very similar to our GingerToon times.

82
00:07:29,881 --> 00:07:34,681
So, all of you probably feel the gravity of the situation instinctively.

83
00:07:34,681 --> 00:07:38,061
We have to prove ourselves worthy of existence by

84
00:07:38,061 --> 00:07:40,111
producing a result good enough to convince the executives.

85
00:07:40,111 --> 00:07:42,511
We have to prove it to them no matter what.

86
00:07:42,511 --> 00:07:44,171
It's just that it won't be easy.

87
00:07:44,171 --> 00:07:46,994
Honestly, Director Heo has continuously shaken us up so far.

88
00:07:46,994 --> 00:07:50,224
He's the type to go the extra mile during the time left.

89
00:07:50,224 --> 00:07:52,090
That's why... we have to shake him up first,

90
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:56,390
so that we'll not be shaken.

91
00:07:56,391 --> 00:07:59,631
By chance, did you stay because you knew this would happen?

92
00:08:06,761 --> 00:08:09,901
You're doing all the cool things by yourself.

93
00:08:12,271 --> 00:08:15,011
Do we have a way out of this? We need to do something, at least.

94
00:08:15,011 --> 00:08:17,251
We came this far only trusting you, Hyeongnim.

95
00:08:17,251 --> 00:08:19,111
We've got to go even if we go down together at the end.

96
00:08:19,111 --> 00:08:21,171
Are we going to be fooled twice?

97
00:08:21,171 --> 00:08:22,151
That's right.

98
00:08:22,151 --> 00:08:26,691
If we go at it full force, we'll surely produce a meaningful result.

99
00:08:27,701 --> 00:08:31,731
I'll plan Artist Oh Yun's new work with him immediately.

100
00:08:32,711 --> 00:08:34,921
Why don't we start it out as a 100-day project

101
00:08:34,921 --> 00:08:39,161
and first do a brainstorming session about how to raise our revenue dramatically.

102
00:08:39,161 --> 00:08:43,561
Great! Great! I think we'll get a ton of ideas. Nice, nice.

103
00:08:43,571 --> 00:08:46,591
We're going on a T.F. (task force) Team mode from now

104
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:48,651
until the very end, with all of our might.

105
00:08:48,651 --> 00:08:50,121
As not to have regrets.

106
00:08:50,121 --> 00:08:53,091
- Going for hanpanseung*!
 - Going for hanpanseung*!
(One whole point in judo.)

107
00:08:53,091 --> 00:08:55,211
Great, great. Fighting.

108
00:08:55,211 --> 00:08:58,611
Okay, that's it for the meeting. Please go about your way now.

109
00:08:58,611 --> 00:09:02,360
You two need to stay. Fighting!

110
00:09:15,101 --> 00:09:18,181
What do you think is the biggest reason Young Toon

111
00:09:18,181 --> 00:09:21,011
is the undisputed number one in the industry right now?

112
00:09:22,111 --> 00:09:24,661
- That's because—
 - Correct.

113
00:09:24,661 --> 00:09:26,871
Mo Yeong Su. That's my PD Seok for you.

114
00:09:26,871 --> 00:09:29,471
Artist Mo Yeong Su.

115
00:09:29,471 --> 00:09:31,811
 There are so many people working on the service team! 

116
00:09:31,811 --> 00:09:33,981
 Did you build up this department? 

117
00:09:33,981 --> 00:09:36,101
 - We built it!
 - Yeong Bae! 

118
00:09:36,101 --> 00:09:38,441
 We all built this service together! 

119
00:09:38,441 --> 00:09:43,031
 You have no idea what kind of offers I declined to go with GingerToon. 

120
00:09:43,031 --> 00:09:47,381
 And after only three months, the service is terminated? 

121
00:09:48,781 --> 00:09:50,311
 I'm very sorry. 

122
00:09:50,311 --> 00:09:52,461
 I have nothing to say. 

123
00:09:55,591 --> 00:09:56,751
 I'm very sorry. 

124
00:09:56,751 --> 00:09:58,401
 I can't even stand the sight of you. 

125
00:09:58,401 --> 00:10:00,361
 Get lost. 

126
00:10:04,041 --> 00:10:05,851
He was already a top artist in the industry,

127
00:10:05,851 --> 00:10:09,330
but now he has become a corporation by running a webtoon studio.

128
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:11,860
 Studio Mo 

129
00:10:14,211 --> 00:10:16,411
Hello, CEO.

130
00:10:16,411 --> 00:10:18,701
Let me brief you on your schedule today.

131
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:21,361
- You have a rookie artist meeting at 10 a.m.
 - Keep up the good work.

132
00:10:21,361 --> 00:10:25,351
- You have lunch with Cocoa Page CEO at 12:30 p.m.
 - Hello.

133
00:10:25,351 --> 00:10:28,381
At 2:40 p.m., you have an appointment with the CPA.

134
00:10:28,381 --> 00:10:30,081
- Also...
 - Hey, is it going well?

135
00:10:30,081 --> 00:10:34,761
At 5 p.m., there's a film company meeting with YH Film.

136
00:10:34,761 --> 00:10:38,481
- At 8 p.m., you'll monitor the CF together.
 - Okay.

137
00:10:38,481 --> 00:10:40,921
- I left the schedule on your desk.
 - Okay.

138
00:10:40,921 --> 00:10:43,461
 Young Toon far surpassed us and  
  CEO's Office 

139
00:10:43,461 --> 00:10:47,381
grew enormously right around the time GingerToon's service was terminated and

140
00:10:47,381 --> 00:10:49,601
Artist Mo Yeong Su had transferred to Young Toon.

141
00:10:49,601 --> 00:10:50,911
That's true.

142
00:10:50,911 --> 00:10:55,611
You can say that Young Toon and our fates switched.

143
00:10:55,611 --> 00:11:00,521
PD Kwon. By chance, have you ever contacted Artist Mo since?

144
00:11:00,531 --> 00:11:01,961
No...

145
00:11:01,961 --> 00:11:04,731
His memory of GingerToon is not good...

146
00:11:04,731 --> 00:11:06,961
Nonetheless, we need him so badly.

147
00:11:06,961 --> 00:11:10,211
For us to prove the worth of our existence at the executives' meeting,

148
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:13,251
we need to have either Artist Mo or an equivalent up our sleeve.

149
00:11:13,251 --> 00:11:15,091
Definitely needed.

150
00:11:15,901 --> 00:11:18,121
It won't be easy.

151
00:11:28,411 --> 00:11:30,911
Whoa, how did you know I was here?

152
00:11:30,911 --> 00:11:33,771
You come here when you have something to think about.

153
00:11:34,531 --> 00:11:36,201
I got busted.

154
00:11:43,361 --> 00:11:45,161
Are you anxious?

155
00:11:47,341 --> 00:11:49,331
No, no, no.

156
00:11:49,331 --> 00:11:53,281
I already knew that my time was limited based on what you said.

157
00:11:53,281 --> 00:11:57,481
It's just that the time came a bit sooner.

158
00:11:57,481 --> 00:11:59,361
I'm okay.

159
00:12:01,001 --> 00:12:03,321
Your face says otherwise.

160
00:12:05,221 --> 00:12:06,901
Does it show?

161
00:12:06,901 --> 00:12:09,011
You're so obvious.

162
00:12:11,701 --> 00:12:13,311
I'm just...

163
00:12:14,111 --> 00:12:18,241
I was resolved to accept whatever result came out

164
00:12:18,241 --> 00:12:21,491
after one year and taking my best run at it.

165
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:26,691
It's upsetting to think that I might have to surrender even before

166
00:12:28,661 --> 00:12:31,001
being able to put up a proper fight.

167
00:12:47,371 --> 00:12:50,221
 Answer right away 

168
00:12:52,361 --> 00:12:55,341
 Heo Kwan Yeong 

169
00:13:10,961 --> 00:13:12,421
Please take good care of us.

170
00:13:12,421 --> 00:13:14,131
Yes, I'll let you know.

171
00:13:14,131 --> 00:13:15,701
- Thank you.
 - Please take care now.

172
00:13:15,701 --> 00:13:17,431
Okay.

173
00:13:18,831 --> 00:13:22,451
CEO, Neon Webtoon contacted us.

174
00:13:22,451 --> 00:13:25,781
Chief Editor Jang Man Cheol asked to meet you in person.

175
00:13:25,781 --> 00:13:27,211
Jang Man Cheol?

176
00:13:27,211 --> 00:13:30,401
Should I decline?

177
00:13:33,551 --> 00:13:36,451
No reason not to meet him. Schedule an appointment.

178
00:13:36,451 --> 00:13:39,217
It's really hitting me that we're on high alert.

179
00:13:39,217 --> 00:13:41,920
Being with you at this time, Hyeong.

180
00:13:42,998 --> 00:13:45,041
Tell me about it.

181
00:13:45,041 --> 00:13:46,859
It's break-even at best.

182
00:13:46,859 --> 00:13:48,969
So, what am I doing here right now?

183
00:13:50,751 --> 00:13:54,041
I thought you would be the most ambivalent, PD Kwon.

184
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:55,761
Thank you.

185
00:13:55,761 --> 00:13:59,901
We need to try our best if we don't want to experience that again.

186
00:14:02,001 --> 00:14:06,781
Now, how are Studio Mo's recent sales?

187
00:14:06,781 --> 00:14:09,351
If you look right here...

188
00:14:09,351 --> 00:14:13,171
this is the monthly user count and this is the sales.

189
00:14:13,171 --> 00:14:14,691
It's only an estimation, 
  Studio Mo Monthly Sales 

190
00:14:14,691 --> 00:14:17,441
but the actual amount would be more, not less.

191
00:14:17,441 --> 00:14:19,771
Four-hundred seventy billion won...

192
00:14:31,201 --> 00:14:34,081
 Neon, On Ma Eum, Webtoon Services 

193
00:14:48,691 --> 00:14:51,931
 Neon, On Ma Eum, Webtoon Services 

194
00:14:53,681 --> 00:14:56,311
 It's the finals from now on. 

195
00:15:00,011 --> 00:15:04,011
 Protecting my team is my gold medal. 

196
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:07,750
 Neon, On Ma Eum, Webtoon Services 

197
00:15:07,751 --> 00:15:09,161
Here's your drink.

198
00:15:09,161 --> 00:15:11,461
Thank you.

199
00:15:14,491 --> 00:15:17,591
- Thank you so much.
 - Don't mention it.

200
00:15:19,811 --> 00:15:21,781
Please take care.

201
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:33,080
♫  The day is calm in the middle surrounded by empty bottles   ♫

202
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:37,150
♫  Singing songs of our own  ♫

203
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:41,201
Good morning. 
  ♫  I will take your hands and won't let go  ♫ 

204
00:15:41,201 --> 00:15:44,681
Good morning to you, too.  ♫  No need to say the words cause you know  ♫ 

205
00:15:44,681 --> 00:15:46,821
I saw you cleaning the front of the cafe this morning.

206
00:15:46,821 --> 00:15:48,771
Oh, did you see me?

207
00:15:48,771 --> 00:15:50,211
I collected these on purpose.

208
00:15:50,211 --> 00:15:53,111
- The trash?
 - No, no. This is good luck.

209
00:15:53,111 --> 00:15:55,961
They say your luck gets better by doing good deeds.

210
00:15:55,961 --> 00:15:57,821
Since we're preparing for the finals,

211
00:15:57,821 --> 00:16:00,661
I think I need to put in this much effort, at least.

212
00:16:00,661 --> 00:16:04,691
Wow. I'm proud of you.

213
00:16:04,691 --> 00:16:06,461
Here. Have some coffee.

214
00:16:06,461 --> 00:16:07,941
Is this for me?

215
00:16:07,941 --> 00:16:09,581
Thanks for the coffee.

216
00:16:09,581 --> 00:16:12,031
Yes!

217
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:16,081
You saw it, right? I already got blessed.

218
00:16:16,081 --> 00:16:18,201
Sure.

219
00:16:18,201 --> 00:16:20,611
- Hello.
 - Oh, good morning.

220
00:16:20,611 --> 00:16:23,411
Hi!

221
00:16:23,411 --> 00:16:29,700
♫  It's alright alright alright alright alright alright alright alright alright  ♫

222
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:35,280
♫  Baby I will always be with you ooh ooh  ♫

223
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:39,400
♫  It's alright alright alright alright alright alright alright alright alright  ♫

224
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:46,700
♫  Baby I will always be with you, My love  ♫

225
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:48,491
Good morning, everyone.

226
00:16:48,491 --> 00:16:50,541
- Hello.
 - You're all coming together?

227
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:52,861
We met in front of the elevator.

228
00:16:52,861 --> 00:16:54,851
We were lucky, right?

229
00:16:54,851 --> 00:16:55,981
Yes, of course.

230
00:16:55,981 --> 00:16:58,111
What is this? Why did you laugh?

231
00:16:58,111 --> 00:17:01,781
Gu Jun Yeong, do you know what they mean?

232
00:17:01,781 --> 00:17:03,571
- Not sure.
 - N-Not sure?

233
00:17:03,571 --> 00:17:05,761
Wh-What is this? Wh-Why did she laugh?

234
00:17:05,761 --> 00:17:08,311
Where is my coffee?

235
00:17:08,311 --> 00:17:10,061
Sorry?

236
00:17:10,061 --> 00:17:12,411
H-Here is your coffee.

237
00:17:12,411 --> 00:17:14,221
Do you not have one more for me?

238
00:17:14,221 --> 00:17:16,621
Did you entrust me with one?

239
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:21,790
 STUDIO MO 

240
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:38,790
 STUDIO MO 

241
00:17:40,281 --> 00:17:43,661
Chief Editor Jang Man Cheol, did you come alone?

242
00:17:43,661 --> 00:17:45,451
Well, it's just been...

243
00:17:45,451 --> 00:17:47,961
a long time since I said hello to you.

244
00:17:47,961 --> 00:17:51,561
Aigoo. Just to say hello?

245
00:17:51,561 --> 00:17:54,331
It's not necessarily just for that reason.

246
00:17:54,331 --> 00:17:56,641
- Please have a seat.
 - Okay.

247
00:18:00,091 --> 00:18:02,271
After I transferred to Neon,

248
00:18:02,271 --> 00:18:05,881
I was so disappointed that I never got to work with you, Artist Mo.

249
00:18:05,881 --> 00:18:09,431
I know. We don't seem to have much luck in working together.

250
00:18:09,431 --> 00:18:14,451
So at least from now, we would love to start working with you.

251
00:18:14,451 --> 00:18:16,191
I'm not sure.

252
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:22,161
I don't think I'll have an opportunity to work with Neon even in the future.

253
00:18:22,161 --> 00:18:23,861
I know that you must be upset.

254
00:18:23,861 --> 00:18:26,671
No, I'm not talking about that aspect.

255
00:18:26,671 --> 00:18:30,491
As you can see, I have a lot of mouths to feed now.

256
00:18:30,491 --> 00:18:33,601
Whether it's for the love-hate or for the old times' sake,

257
00:18:34,181 --> 00:18:38,831
I don't have the mindset to be swayed by those kinds of emotions.

258
00:18:38,831 --> 00:18:43,631
The profit and loss regarding the business is what's important.

259
00:18:44,931 --> 00:18:52,151
But even so, a rival is always prone to provide tension, right?

260
00:18:53,601 --> 00:18:56,671
A rival?

261
00:18:56,671 --> 00:18:58,751
She must be here.

262
00:18:58,751 --> 00:19:00,731
Please come in.

263
00:19:01,481 --> 00:19:03,371
She's here.

264
00:19:03,371 --> 00:19:06,691
- Hello, Artist Mo.
 - Welcome.

265
00:19:08,231 --> 00:19:14,491
I already had a tight meeting scheduled in advance with Deputy Editor Jang Hye Mi,

266
00:19:14,491 --> 00:19:18,231
but since you two already know each other, it would be fine, right?

267
00:19:18,231 --> 00:19:19,901
No, I'll come back after you two are done.

268
00:19:19,901 --> 00:19:21,481
No, there's no need to do that.

269
00:19:21,481 --> 00:19:26,141
I'm done talking with Chief Editor Jang Man Cheol.

270
00:19:31,871 --> 00:19:34,511
I'll come back again next time, sir.

271
00:19:49,361 --> 00:19:52,171
PD Jan—, no...

272
00:19:52,171 --> 00:19:56,461
Deputy Editor Jang Hye Mi, you came out soon.

273
00:19:56,461 --> 00:19:58,111
I thought you would take longer.

274
00:19:58,111 --> 00:20:01,151
He said he won't be seeing you today.

275
00:20:04,671 --> 00:20:08,351
Are you trying to take Artist Mo away from our company?

276
00:20:09,028 --> 00:20:10,821
We need to do all that we can as well.

277
00:20:10,821 --> 00:20:13,871
I didn't know you were this kind of a person.

278
00:20:13,871 --> 00:20:15,911
Seriously.

279
00:20:15,911 --> 00:20:18,681
Wow. So, a day like this does come.

280
00:20:18,681 --> 00:20:24,001
I was glad for you when you transferred to Young Toon.

281
00:20:24,001 --> 00:20:26,691
I don't think badly of it.

282
00:20:26,691 --> 00:20:31,141
It would've been better if you showed this side of yourself earlier.

283
00:20:31,961 --> 00:20:37,761
If you did, we all might still be together even now.

284
00:20:42,031 --> 00:20:46,121
Back then, I was lacking in many ways.

285
00:20:46,121 --> 00:20:49,351
That's why I'm going to try my best, at least from now.

286
00:20:52,191 --> 00:20:55,971
Miss Hang Hye Mi, you're doing well.

287
00:20:55,971 --> 00:20:58,611
You're doing well in your position and

288
00:20:58,611 --> 00:21:00,931
I'll d-do...

289
00:21:06,331 --> 00:21:08,451
I'll try my best.

290
00:21:19,621 --> 00:21:22,821
I'm trying to convince Artist Na to do long serialization of

291
00:21:22,821 --> 00:21:25,271
"Cold-blooded" with us, but 
  Project: Artist Na Gang Nam, "Cold-blooded" Spinoff 

292
00:21:25,271 --> 00:21:29,171
I think Young Toon is also on a pretty strong offensive.

293
00:21:29,171 --> 00:21:31,461
Anyhow, this is the situation so far.

294
00:21:31,461 --> 00:21:36,711
From now on, it'll be your job to convince Artist Na.

295
00:21:36,711 --> 00:21:38,571
You can do it, right?

296
00:21:40,521 --> 00:21:42,301
Yes, I understand.

297
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:44,411
What's wrong with your reaction?

298
00:21:44,411 --> 00:21:46,201
It's not like you.

299
00:21:46,201 --> 00:21:52,141
Since every case we're promoting right now will decide the future of the company,

300
00:21:52,141 --> 00:21:58,561
I'm not sure if I should take this case, where we have to battle Young Toon head-on, alone.

301
00:21:59,931 --> 00:22:04,891
I'm giving you this case because I believe that you'll do a good job even on your own.

302
00:22:04,891 --> 00:22:11,271
In this situation, do you know who can protect you?

303
00:22:11,271 --> 00:22:13,381
Protect me?

304
00:22:13,381 --> 00:22:17,051
Chief Editor?  No, you, Deputy Editor?

305
00:22:17,051 --> 00:22:19,251
It's yourself.

306
00:22:20,761 --> 00:22:25,971
As you said, every case will decide the life or death of our team,

307
00:22:25,971 --> 00:22:29,641
and no one will be able to mess with you

308
00:22:29,641 --> 00:22:33,321
if you become a PD who made one of those cases happen.

309
00:22:36,141 --> 00:22:38,071
You can do it, right?

310
00:22:44,241 --> 00:22:46,201
Yes, sir!

311
00:22:46,201 --> 00:22:49,101
Are you really able to do this?

312
00:22:50,061 --> 00:22:52,421
I'll do my best!

313
00:22:53,571 --> 00:22:56,401
Yes, that's more like you, On Ma Eum.

314
00:22:56,401 --> 00:22:59,031
My gosh, even so...

315
00:22:59,031 --> 00:23:01,580
Even so, you have to go together for the first meeting.

316
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:04,170
All right.

317
00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:05,431
Let's go.

318
00:23:05,431 --> 00:23:07,651
- Anyway, let's try convincing him. 
 - Okay.

319
00:23:07,651 --> 00:23:10,422
I think what we tell him first will be important.

320
00:23:10,422 --> 00:23:12,422
How we say it in the beginning...

321
00:23:13,492 --> 00:23:14,821
Bon appetit.

322
00:23:14,821 --> 00:23:16,771
Thank you.

323
00:23:20,288 --> 00:23:22,171
Please have some.

324
00:23:22,171 --> 00:23:24,541
Whoa, daebak.

325
00:23:31,844 --> 00:23:33,521
It tastes good.

326
00:23:33,521 --> 00:23:35,071
I was a bit hungry. Thanks for the food.

327
00:23:35,071 --> 00:23:36,701
Please enjoy.

328
00:23:36,701 --> 00:23:38,201
Okay.

329
00:23:39,378 --> 00:23:42,021
The love line idea that you spoke of last time,

330
00:23:42,021 --> 00:23:45,758
I did a comparative analysis based on each character line.

331
00:23:45,758 --> 00:23:47,828
Thank you. 
  Full Count 

332
00:23:51,297 --> 00:23:54,661
The line changed a bit here. 
   04. Love line (NEW) 

333
00:23:54,661 --> 00:23:57,471
Didn't we initially decide that she'd end up with her seonbae?

334
00:23:57,471 --> 00:24:00,773
First of all, I did analyze both outlines.

335
00:24:00,773 --> 00:24:04,123
My personal opinion is whether we must have her end up with her seonbae?

336
00:24:07,531 --> 00:24:09,621
 Gu Jun Yeong 

337
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,480
 On Ma Eum 

338
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,571
 Instead of ending up with the seonbae, who's more of a helper, 

339
00:24:17,571 --> 00:24:19,924
 I think ending up with the fellow player she's growing up alongside 

340
00:24:19,924 --> 00:24:23,084
 would have more romantic comedic fun in it, no? 

341
00:24:23,948 --> 00:24:27,701
 Even so, the popular sentiment usually falls on a seonbae with eyeglasses like the one we have. 

342
00:24:27,701 --> 00:24:29,891
 I think it'd be better for her to connect with the seonbae. 

343
00:24:29,891 --> 00:24:32,601
Try holding up your bat.

344
00:24:32,601 --> 00:24:34,991
Grab the bottom of the bat here. It'll make a long shot.

345
00:24:34,991 --> 00:24:36,541
And when the ball comes...

346
00:24:36,541 --> 00:24:38,631
When the ball is here, that's when you swing.

347
00:24:38,631 --> 00:24:40,921
- Oh, okay, okay.
 - Do you understand?

348
00:24:40,921 --> 00:24:43,801
Jun Yeong, one more pitch.

349
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:50,590
  #3 On Ma Eum 
 HOMERUN 

350
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:52,190
 Wow! 

351
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:53,310
 Ha ha ha ha 

352
00:24:53,381 --> 00:24:54,811
Good job!

353
00:24:54,811 --> 00:24:56,461
- That's how you do it.
 - Wow

354
00:24:56,461 --> 00:24:59,101
It goes a long way when you grab it short and swing right.

355
00:24:59,101 --> 00:25:01,371
Exactly!

356
00:25:03,098 --> 00:25:05,831
That kind of relationship isn't too appealing.

357
00:25:05,831 --> 00:25:08,201
It's not like they're a coach and a player.

358
00:25:08,201 --> 00:25:11,171
What did you say?

359
00:25:11,171 --> 00:25:14,550
Really. seriously. 
 What?

360
00:25:17,051 --> 00:25:20,601
Come on. Certainly, these seonbaes have a reassuring charm.

361
00:25:20,601 --> 00:25:23,421
Once they get under your skin, it's game over.

362
00:25:24,423 --> 00:25:27,811
Well, of course, the story needs to be fixed to make it more fun.

363
00:25:27,811 --> 00:25:30,631
I'm saying that's the reality.

364
00:25:30,631 --> 00:25:32,841
Please, help yourself.

365
00:25:32,841 --> 00:25:34,490
Okay.

366
00:25:41,774 --> 00:25:44,011
Are you sure there is no problem with you guys?

367
00:25:44,011 --> 00:25:48,461
Of course. So far, nothing has been decided, Artist Na.

368
00:25:48,461 --> 00:25:50,711
I have a service termination trauma

369
00:25:50,711 --> 00:25:53,771
because of that ruckus back then with GingerToon.

370
00:25:57,089 --> 00:25:59,551
The long serialization of "Cold-blooded,"

371
00:25:59,551 --> 00:26:02,351
I don't think I can confirm that I'll do it on Neon for now.

372
00:26:02,351 --> 00:26:03,291
Artist Na...

373
00:26:03,291 --> 00:26:06,291
My darling is cold-blooded when he has to be.

374
00:26:06,291 --> 00:26:09,981
There's a reason why he named this one "Cold-hearted."

375
00:26:09,981 --> 00:26:11,591
It's "Cold-blooded," not "Cold-hearted."

376
00:26:11,591 --> 00:26:13,451
That's the same thing.

377
00:26:13,451 --> 00:26:15,481
Be cold-hearted?

378
00:26:15,481 --> 00:26:17,401
Anyway, it's a headache for me, too.

379
00:26:17,401 --> 00:26:19,521
They're all my babies, so I can't let a single one go.

380
00:26:19,521 --> 00:26:22,284
But I also can't do all the work by myself, either.

381
00:26:22,284 --> 00:26:25,514
I would be happy, too, if there was a way.

382
00:26:26,111 --> 00:26:28,491
A way?

383
00:26:31,171 --> 00:26:33,101
Why isn't this working?

384
00:26:49,558 --> 00:26:51,161
I'm back!

385
00:26:51,161 --> 00:26:53,771
You're back.

386
00:26:53,771 --> 00:26:55,151
How was Artist Mo's reaction?

387
00:26:55,151 --> 00:26:57,949
I still need to talk to him more for now.

388
00:26:59,481 --> 00:27:02,341
Hello, PD Kim. Long time no see.

389
00:27:03,551 --> 00:27:06,611
Of course, it's still alive. No one bought it ye—

390
00:27:08,301 --> 00:27:10,141
Oh, really?

391
00:27:10,881 --> 00:27:12,701
Really?

392
00:27:14,671 --> 00:27:16,491
Of course, we'd love that.

393
00:27:16,491 --> 00:27:19,441
Okay then, let's tal— I mean, schedule a date soon.

394
00:27:19,441 --> 00:27:20,891
Yeah.

395
00:27:20,891 --> 00:27:24,981
It's fine. Put in a good word to the director.

396
00:27:24,981 --> 00:27:26,841
Okay, thank you.

397
00:27:26,841 --> 00:27:28,911
Hey, a daebak case!

398
00:27:28,911 --> 00:27:33,281
Director Sin Ji Won said he wants to remake "Peeve Weapon" as a drama.

399
00:27:33,281 --> 00:27:34,601
A drama...

400
00:27:34,601 --> 00:27:37,831
Director Sin Ji Won. Isn't he a total hitmaker?

401
00:27:37,831 --> 00:27:40,991
He's reviewing it as a candidate to produce at the global OTT ("Over-the-top media service") Marblix.

402
00:27:40,991 --> 00:27:42,401
Seriously a daebak!

403
00:27:42,401 --> 00:27:45,381
If this works out, it's the best issue for us.

404
00:27:45,381 --> 00:27:47,741
Something to prove the worth of Neon Webtoon's existence...

405
00:27:47,741 --> 00:27:49,951
The timing for this is crazy!

406
00:27:49,951 --> 00:27:51,981
It's also a huge thing for Artist Sin Dae Ryuk.

407
00:27:51,981 --> 00:27:52,981
Of course!

408
00:27:52,981 --> 00:27:55,621
PD On Ma Eum, deliver this news well to Artist Sin as well, okay?

409
00:27:55,621 --> 00:27:57,161
What is there to deliver the news and whatnot?

410
00:27:57,161 --> 00:27:59,411
Of course, he would love it.

411
00:28:09,211 --> 00:28:11,511
I don't want to do it.

412
00:28:15,261 --> 00:28:20,451
The important thing is that if it's remade, the added value of "Peeve Weapon" goes up.

413
00:28:20,451 --> 00:28:23,121
- It'll be an issue maker for sure, too.
 - I...

414
00:28:23,121 --> 00:28:26,081
just want to show my comic.

415
00:28:26,081 --> 00:28:27,581
That's all.

416
00:28:27,581 --> 00:28:30,661
"Peeve Weapon" was originally imagined as a comic and

417
00:28:30,661 --> 00:28:33,771
I don't want to remake it in a different genre.

418
00:28:38,281 --> 00:28:42,671
You want to communicate through your comic.

419
00:28:43,481 --> 00:28:46,200
When "Peeve Weapon" was first opened to the world,

420
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:49,580
I vividly remember your reaction.

421
00:28:49,581 --> 00:28:52,520
You seemed a lot happier than

422
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:55,900
when you were drawing a comic in your room alone.

423
00:28:55,904 --> 00:28:57,930
If "Peeve Weapon" is dramatized,

424
00:28:57,930 --> 00:29:02,110
a lot more people will meet your comic than now.

425
00:29:02,111 --> 00:29:06,591
I'm sure it'll also be a great experience for you.

426
00:29:06,591 --> 00:29:11,471
Please reconsider one more time.

427
00:29:19,421 --> 00:29:24,761
If it doesn't work out, is it bad for you, PD On?

428
00:29:30,811 --> 00:29:34,711
That's true, but your choice is more important.

429
00:29:35,374 --> 00:29:37,811
I'm not forcing you to do it. I'm making a request.

430
00:29:37,811 --> 00:29:39,561
I'll do it.

431
00:29:40,481 --> 00:29:42,161
Really?

432
00:29:42,921 --> 00:29:47,101
If it's what you need, I'll do it.

433
00:29:49,291 --> 00:29:50,411
Thank you, Artist Sin!

434
00:29:50,411 --> 00:29:52,911
Thank you so much! I'll lead the project well for sure.

435
00:29:52,911 --> 00:29:54,401
Thank you so, so much!

436
00:29:54,401 --> 00:29:56,481
Seriously, thank you!

437
00:29:58,551 --> 00:30:01,531
- I'm home.
 -  Welcome. 

438
00:30:01,531 --> 00:30:04,231
Oh, my. That reminds me.

439
00:30:04,231 --> 00:30:06,151
I don't have curry powder when I need to make curry.

440
00:30:06,151 --> 00:30:07,291
Aigoo, Madam Hwang, again...

441
00:30:07,291 --> 00:30:10,041
- Do I need to go buy some?
 - Yeah, wait.

442
00:30:10,041 --> 00:30:11,191
Dear.

443
00:30:11,191 --> 00:30:13,521
Go with Ma Eum and get some groceries.

444
00:30:13,521 --> 00:30:16,111
- No, no, no. I can go on my own.
 - No, no.

445
00:30:16,111 --> 00:30:19,781
Since you're going to the market, buy some stuff we need anyway.

446
00:30:19,781 --> 00:30:22,171
We're out of all the bottled water.

447
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:24,501
Dad.

448
00:30:24,501 --> 00:30:26,241
Your butt is too heavy (you need to get up and move it).

449
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:28,071
Hurry up.

450
00:30:36,402 --> 00:30:37,671
What are you doing?

451
00:30:37,671 --> 00:30:39,921
- Hurry up and come back.
 - Okay.

452
00:30:40,661 --> 00:30:41,784
Thanks.

453
00:30:41,784 --> 00:30:43,624
I'll be back.

454
00:30:44,751 --> 00:30:46,421
But I saw curry powder somewhere...

455
00:30:46,421 --> 00:30:48,391
Where was it?

456
00:30:53,261 --> 00:30:55,341
Madam Hwang!

457
00:30:55,341 --> 00:30:56,741
The curry powder is here.

458
00:30:56,741 --> 00:30:59,041
That's not curry powder.

459
00:30:59,901 --> 00:31:02,381
I never got to learn Korean properly.

460
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:17,500
- Put your belt on. 
 - Okay.

461
00:31:22,381 --> 00:31:24,581
You put on that cologne?

462
00:31:25,251 --> 00:31:28,151
Didn't you give it to me to use?

463
00:31:32,111 --> 00:31:33,951
Here we go.

464
00:31:41,411 --> 00:31:44,661
You said you weren't going to use it.

465
00:31:56,041 --> 00:31:59,171
- Please enjoy.
 - Thank you.

466
00:32:00,091 --> 00:32:01,971
It's a one plus one sale.

467
00:32:01,971 --> 00:32:03,931
Choose the flavor you want and take it.

468
00:32:03,931 --> 00:32:06,371
Here, here. Have a taste.

469
00:32:07,761 --> 00:32:09,681
- Here.
 - Okay.

470
00:32:09,681 --> 00:32:11,971
Do you want to eat?

471
00:32:18,731 --> 00:32:21,091
- It's good.
 - The sale ends today.

472
00:32:21,091 --> 00:32:22,791
Take two bags with you.

473
00:32:22,791 --> 00:32:23,951
Okay, give me two.

474
00:32:23,951 --> 00:32:25,211
Which flavor do you want?

475
00:32:25,211 --> 00:32:26,461
There are meat and kimchi flavors.

476
00:32:26,461 --> 00:32:28,971
Two bags of kimchi, please.

477
00:32:28,971 --> 00:32:30,821
Your eating habits are exactly the same as father and daughter.

478
00:32:30,821 --> 00:32:32,551
Although your faces look nothing alike.

479
00:32:32,551 --> 00:32:33,751
What's the matter, huh?

480
00:32:33,751 --> 00:32:35,951
I lost her when she was young in our hometown,

481
00:32:35,951 --> 00:32:37,561
and the neighbors looked at just her face and said,

482
00:32:37,561 --> 00:32:40,041
"Oh, she's Gi Bong's daughter, whichever way you look,"

483
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:41,511
and brought her home.

484
00:32:41,511 --> 00:32:44,351
Oh, okay, okay.

485
00:32:44,351 --> 00:32:46,311
- Okay.
 - What's the matter?

486
00:32:46,311 --> 00:32:47,881
- Please enjoy.
 - Thank you.

487
00:32:47,881 --> 00:32:49,961
- Enjoy your meal.
 - Okay, hope you sell a lot.

488
00:32:49,961 --> 00:32:52,781
Nu Ri, come eat dinner.

489
00:32:52,781 --> 00:32:54,481
Okay.

490
00:32:57,281 --> 00:32:59,901
It's so nice to eat with all four of us like this after a long time.

491
00:32:59,901 --> 00:33:01,381
It's so nice.

492
00:33:01,381 --> 00:33:03,351
Thanks for the meal.

493
00:33:04,671 --> 00:33:07,391
You two eat the same way, too.

494
00:33:13,911 --> 00:33:15,891
Just look at that.

495
00:33:18,191 --> 00:33:20,341
Gosh, really.

496
00:33:22,371 --> 00:33:24,861
What are you two doing?

497
00:33:24,861 --> 00:33:28,171
Dear. A glass of soju?

498
00:33:28,171 --> 00:33:30,401
Just not the ginseng liquor.

499
00:33:31,591 --> 00:33:32,681
What is this?

500
00:33:32,681 --> 00:33:35,531
- What's going on? 
- Hey.

501
00:33:35,531 --> 00:33:37,721
Your dad almost died.

502
00:33:37,721 --> 00:33:39,731
You must be crazy, Mom!

503
00:33:39,731 --> 00:33:40,571
Really?

504
00:33:40,571 --> 00:33:42,461
Silence. I didn't hear anything.

505
00:33:42,461 --> 00:33:44,021
I don't want another sibling! Never.

506
00:33:44,021 --> 00:33:45,291
Am I getting a younger sibling?

507
00:33:45,291 --> 00:33:48,341
- I'm so happy!
 - I'm not!

508
00:33:50,791 --> 00:33:52,661
I'm doing better than you think.

509
00:33:52,661 --> 00:33:54,611
PD On, you're also coming on purpose, right?

510
00:33:54,611 --> 00:33:57,941
No, I'm coming because I like you, Artist Pomme.

511
00:33:59,621 --> 00:34:01,301
You, too, PD Jun Yeong?

512
00:34:01,301 --> 00:34:02,911
Sorry?

513
00:34:05,651 --> 00:34:09,554
I'm coming because I like your cat.

514
00:34:09,554 --> 00:34:11,594
What the heck?

515
00:34:18,731 --> 00:34:20,201
We'll come to see you again soon.

516
00:34:20,201 --> 00:34:22,561
You don't need to continue coming so often like this in the future.

517
00:34:22,561 --> 00:34:23,701
Especially bringing PD On as well.

518
00:34:23,701 --> 00:34:25,531
Artist Pomme, are you already sick of me?

519
00:34:25,531 --> 00:34:27,551
That isn't the case.

520
00:34:27,551 --> 00:34:29,921
We'll buy you some stuff you need before we leave.

521
00:34:29,921 --> 00:34:31,461
It must be inconvenient since you can't order online anymore.

522
00:34:31,461 --> 00:34:34,881
That's okay. It's inconvenient for you to go back and forth.

523
00:34:34,881 --> 00:34:38,151
I'll go with them and bring them with me.

524
00:34:38,151 --> 00:34:40,151
Will you do that? Thank you.

525
00:34:40,151 --> 00:34:42,171
No problem.

526
00:34:56,451 --> 00:35:00,421
How long have you worked with Artist Pomme?

527
00:35:01,311 --> 00:35:04,701
About six months now.

528
00:35:04,701 --> 00:35:06,081
How is it

529
00:35:06,081 --> 00:35:09,521
coming to work in person after only communicating through text.

530
00:35:09,521 --> 00:35:11,811
It's nice. Very nice.

531
00:35:13,041 --> 00:35:15,191
I'm very happy.

532
00:35:16,968 --> 00:35:19,852
Have you seen a suspicious person on your commute?

533
00:35:19,852 --> 00:35:21,956
I haven't seen any.

534
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:39,521
Excuse me.

535
00:35:39,521 --> 00:35:41,481
Aren't you going to take the return packages?

536
00:35:41,481 --> 00:35:43,171
I'm not a delivery man.

537
00:35:43,171 --> 00:35:45,991
Come on, you are. I recognize your face.

538
00:35:45,991 --> 00:35:48,601
You said you were a delivery man a few days ago.

539
00:35:49,782 --> 00:35:52,691
 They sent me a delivery confirmation with a picture. 

540
00:35:52,691 --> 00:35:55,351
 But by the time I came home, it wasn't there. 

541
00:35:55,351 --> 00:35:56,814
 Artist Pomme, I love you! 

542
00:35:56,814 --> 00:35:58,724
 Get off of me! 

543
00:36:00,061 --> 00:36:02,421
 I already recorded everything. 

544
00:36:03,191 --> 00:36:05,401
You got the wrong person.

545
00:36:07,065 --> 00:36:08,791
- Hey.
 - What?

546
00:36:08,791 --> 00:36:10,761
Haven't we met before at the Webtoon Artists' party?

547
00:36:10,761 --> 00:36:14,011
No. I don't know you... It's my first time seeing—

548
00:36:14,011 --> 00:36:15,841
- Get out of the way!
 - Hey!

549
00:36:15,841 --> 00:36:17,521
Stop right there!

550
00:36:22,581 --> 00:36:24,811
Stop right there!

551
00:36:29,211 --> 00:36:31,501
Move, move, move!

552
00:36:32,351 --> 00:36:34,231
Move it!

553
00:36:43,802 --> 00:36:45,204
I'm okay...

554
00:36:45,204 --> 00:36:46,984
I'm sorry.

555
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:53,251
Jun Yeong, keep following him.

556
00:36:54,511 --> 00:36:56,501
Stop following me...

557
00:37:07,411 --> 00:37:09,171
Don't come closer.

558
00:37:09,171 --> 00:37:11,701
Don't come any closer!

559
00:37:11,701 --> 00:37:14,171
What the hell did I do wrong?

560
00:37:14,171 --> 00:37:17,291
All of you, I'll report you to the police.

561
00:37:17,291 --> 00:37:19,171
- Don't come any closer!
 - Why?

562
00:37:19,171 --> 00:37:20,921
Are you going to turn yourself in?

563
00:37:20,921 --> 00:37:22,291
What kind of bulls*** is that!

564
00:37:22,291 --> 00:37:24,861
You're Artist Pomme's stalker.

565
00:37:24,861 --> 00:37:27,481
I've got pretty keen eyes.

566
00:37:28,361 --> 00:37:29,571
You got any proof?

567
00:37:29,571 --> 00:37:30,941
Do you have proof?

568
00:37:30,941 --> 00:37:33,491
Stop accusing an innocent person!

569
00:37:33,491 --> 00:37:35,811
Get out! Move!

570
00:37:44,521 --> 00:37:47,321
Hire an attorney if you think it's unfair.

571
00:37:47,321 --> 00:37:49,721
Let's go to the police first.

572
00:37:51,191 --> 00:37:52,951
Police?

573
00:37:52,951 --> 00:37:55,721
That stalker back then was still following me around?

574
00:37:55,721 --> 00:37:58,941
Yes. He's the one who hacked your home CCTV as well.

575
00:37:58,941 --> 00:38:02,671
Since we complained to the management office, the security will also be strengthened.

576
00:38:02,671 --> 00:38:05,101
I'll also come by more often for a while.

577
00:38:05,101 --> 00:38:08,231
I'm sorry, Artist Pomme.

578
00:38:08,231 --> 00:38:13,661
If I were more aware on my commute, I could've realized it sooner.

579
00:38:13,661 --> 00:38:19,941
Actually, I have difficulties looking at people in the eyes.

580
00:38:22,641 --> 00:38:25,960
I also find it most difficult dealing with people

581
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:29,000
and it's obviously not your fault, Hyeon Su.

582
00:38:31,491 --> 00:38:35,521
Two of you, could you continue to commute going forward?

583
00:38:35,521 --> 00:38:38,471
It was actually a great help working with the two of you here.

584
00:38:38,471 --> 00:38:40,031
I'd love to, Artist Pomme.

585
00:38:40,031 --> 00:38:41,981
Me, too.

586
00:38:43,091 --> 00:38:46,001
Then, I look forward to continuing this.

587
00:38:51,181 --> 00:38:54,931
She must've been really shaken, but she stood firmer than I expected.

588
00:38:54,931 --> 00:38:59,111
I know. Even so, I'm relieved since we caught the stalker.

589
00:38:59,111 --> 00:39:00,941
You did great, Ma Eum.

590
00:39:02,151 --> 00:39:05,011
But wait one second.

591
00:39:08,561 --> 00:39:09,571
Are you okay?

592
00:39:09,571 --> 00:39:12,081
I think I sprained it a bit when I fell earlier.

593
00:39:12,081 --> 00:39:13,921
I'm fine.

594
00:39:23,021 --> 00:39:26,921
You're good at taping.

595
00:39:26,921 --> 00:39:29,951
I did this all the time when I was an athlete.

596
00:39:33,431 --> 00:39:36,351
I should've bought some scissors.

597
00:39:41,151 --> 00:39:42,971
Thanks.

598
00:39:47,951 --> 00:39:49,811
Are you better now?

599
00:39:49,811 --> 00:39:52,501
Yeah. What about you?

600
00:39:52,501 --> 00:39:53,451
Me?

601
00:39:53,451 --> 00:39:56,771
You fell to the ground earlier.

602
00:39:57,881 --> 00:39:59,721
I'm okay.

603
00:40:00,791 --> 00:40:04,001
See? You're not okay.

604
00:40:04,001 --> 00:40:05,901
One moment.

605
00:40:30,671 --> 00:40:32,991
Try turning your wrist.

606
00:40:36,721 --> 00:40:38,931
- I think I feel better.
 - Really?

607
00:40:38,931 --> 00:40:40,311
I'm glad.

608
00:40:40,311 --> 00:40:43,771
Make sure you put a hot pack on it when you get home.

609
00:40:45,301 --> 00:40:46,531
Ma Eum.

610
00:40:46,531 --> 00:40:48,181
Yeah.

611
00:41:01,821 --> 00:41:03,671
Never mind.

612
00:41:03,671 --> 00:41:05,631
I won't say it right now.

613
00:41:05,631 --> 00:41:07,051
What?

614
00:41:07,051 --> 00:41:09,111
Later.

615
00:41:09,111 --> 00:41:12,371
I want to tell you later properly.

616
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:16,200
What is this? Making me curious...

617
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:24,600
Do it like this, yes. Are you okay?

618
00:41:53,561 --> 00:41:55,941
 Can I meet with you tomorrow? 

619
00:41:57,821 --> 00:42:00,051
Is there good news?

620
00:42:00,051 --> 00:42:02,411
Nope, nothing.

621
00:42:04,751 --> 00:42:08,381
We won't have any issues this time, right?

622
00:42:09,611 --> 00:42:13,021
Only if CEO Yun Tae Hui hadn't stolen from us three years ago

623
00:42:13,021 --> 00:42:18,381
what you had prepared for us to swallow, things would've been a lot easier.

624
00:42:18,381 --> 00:42:19,571
That's true.

625
00:42:19,571 --> 00:42:23,461
Back then,  I did all the work and someone else got the credit.

626
00:42:23,461 --> 00:42:27,141
But who would've known that things would work out like this?

627
00:42:27,141 --> 00:42:29,971
That I would be working at Neon?

628
00:42:29,971 --> 00:42:31,201
That's true.

629
00:42:31,201 --> 00:42:34,301
Those who are fated to succeed will eventually succeed, right?

630
00:42:37,301 --> 00:42:41,621
The acquisition price will be the same as what you said before, right?

631
00:42:44,361 --> 00:42:46,151
Okay.

632
00:42:59,301 --> 00:43:01,171
All right.

633
00:43:12,881 --> 00:43:14,421
Eonni.

634
00:43:14,421 --> 00:43:16,251
What?

635
00:43:16,251 --> 00:43:18,031
Hey, you bought this, right?

636
00:43:18,031 --> 00:43:19,791
The scent is really good.

637
00:43:19,791 --> 00:43:22,751
Of course, I was worried about your skin.

638
00:43:22,751 --> 00:43:24,211
Why are you doing this?

639
00:43:24,211 --> 00:43:26,601
So, could I borrow your clothes, Eonni?

640
00:43:26,601 --> 00:43:28,901
What? Why would On Nu Ri borrow my clothes?

641
00:43:28,901 --> 00:43:32,161
Because I'm going to work out with my friend tomorrow.

642
00:43:32,161 --> 00:43:34,351
Okay.

643
00:43:34,351 --> 00:43:37,321
Don't you have anything that looks cool?

644
00:43:37,321 --> 00:43:39,441
What's this? Did you get hurt?

645
00:43:39,441 --> 00:43:42,711
Well, just a little bit.

646
00:43:42,711 --> 00:43:46,371
I thought you only get hurt doing judo, but you still get hurt while working in an office.

647
00:43:46,371 --> 00:43:48,791
You should've been more careful.

648
00:43:48,791 --> 00:43:51,711
 - Ma Eum.
 - Yeah. 

649
00:43:53,791 --> 00:43:55,601
 Never mind. 

650
00:43:55,601 --> 00:43:58,013
 I won't say it right now.
 

651
00:43:58,013 --> 00:44:01,663
 I want to tell you later properly.
 

652
00:44:02,371 --> 00:44:03,691
What's this?

653
00:44:03,691 --> 00:44:05,761
You seem to be thinking of someone.

654
00:44:05,761 --> 00:44:06,811
No, I'm not.

655
00:44:06,811 --> 00:44:10,341
Could it be that person I'm thinking of?

656
00:44:11,051 --> 00:44:15,411
- That's not it.
 - You seem very startled right now, though.

657
00:44:17,561 --> 00:44:19,071
Mom!

658
00:44:19,071 --> 00:44:20,981
Mom...

659
00:44:29,721 --> 00:44:33,071
I was careless back then.

660
00:44:39,191 --> 00:44:41,741
This is the data you asked for.

661
00:44:45,421 --> 00:44:47,421
I don't need it now.

662
00:44:51,011 --> 00:44:53,511
I don't know what you're scheming,

663
00:44:53,511 --> 00:44:56,971
but that data is not that big a deal, is it?

664
00:44:56,971 --> 00:44:59,691
If my stomach gets upset from eating something trivial like that,

665
00:44:59,691 --> 00:45:01,461
wouldn't I also feel mistreated?

666
00:45:01,461 --> 00:45:03,940
If you could give me one more chance,

667
00:45:03,940 --> 00:45:07,161
I won't disappoint you anymore.

668
00:45:07,161 --> 00:45:11,400
Indeed, it would be a waste to allow so talented a person

669
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:15,751
to fly away with that team.

670
00:45:15,751 --> 00:45:19,831
Okay. I'll give you one last chance.

671
00:45:21,508 --> 00:45:23,221
Based on the data,

672
00:45:23,221 --> 00:45:27,821
bring me a report that concludes that it's more profitable to acquire Young Toon.

673
00:45:27,821 --> 00:45:31,911
Filled with substantial evidence.

674
00:45:31,911 --> 00:45:34,411
That's your specialty, right?

675
00:45:39,691 --> 00:45:41,971
That proposal draft from back then was okay, right?

676
00:45:41,971 --> 00:45:42,961
Yes.

677
00:45:42,961 --> 00:45:46,431
PD Kwon, how was that draft proposal?

678
00:45:48,311 --> 00:45:50,841
- P-PD Kwon.
 - Yeah?

679
00:45:50,841 --> 00:45:53,301
- What's the matter? What are you thinking? 
- No, nothing.

680
00:45:53,301 --> 00:45:56,521
- Please check my draft proposal.
 - Oh, okay.

681
00:46:09,831 --> 00:46:12,801
 I'll go meet Artist Mo Yeong Soo. 

682
00:46:16,631 --> 00:46:18,681
 Company CEO Mo Yeong Soo 

683
00:46:18,681 --> 00:46:21,581
How much longer will you be coming around?

684
00:46:22,571 --> 00:46:26,211
I need to work harder to have you work with us.

685
00:46:27,831 --> 00:46:33,161
This method of doing business is quite old.

686
00:46:34,021 --> 00:46:40,841
The effort is effort, and I also shouldn't make faulty business proposals.

687
00:46:40,841 --> 00:46:46,161
What proposal can Neon make to me?

688
00:46:46,161 --> 00:46:49,921
I'm already getting top-of-the-industry treatment from Young Toon.

689
00:46:49,921 --> 00:46:53,201
Young Toon is also at the top of the industry.

690
00:46:55,671 --> 00:47:01,751
However, you didn't sign the contract with GingerToon because it was at the top of the industry.

691
00:47:04,511 --> 00:47:10,031
Wow, thanks to that mistake from back then, I sure learned my lesson.

692
00:47:10,031 --> 00:47:14,201
Business is done based only on conditions and

693
00:47:14,201 --> 00:47:18,581
the system must protect the artist from jeopardy.

694
00:47:20,181 --> 00:47:24,961
 I know you don't have enough time to produce any meaningful results.
 

695
00:47:25,681 --> 00:47:28,191
 However, if you bring me a solution,  

696
00:47:28,191 --> 00:47:32,221
 then win by using everything Neon has to offer at your disposal... 

697
00:47:32,961 --> 00:47:38,791
For exactly that reason, you need to work with us, Neon Webtoon.

698
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:47,400
Neon is proposing a contract that will attract investments to Studio Mo.

699
00:47:49,251 --> 00:47:52,771
It's true that Neon Webtoon lacks recognition compared to Young Toon.

700
00:47:52,771 --> 00:47:57,791
However, Neon, the head office is at the top of South Korea's IT industry.

701
00:47:57,791 --> 00:48:00,731
If the two companies form a stable relationship following Neon's investment,

702
00:48:00,731 --> 00:48:05,691
all of Neon's infrastructure will be shared with your company.

703
00:48:08,831 --> 00:48:12,711
Please give me a chance to make up for my previous mistake, Artist Mo.

704
00:48:17,701 --> 00:48:21,131
Let's discuss this at the next meeting.

705
00:48:21,131 --> 00:48:23,031
We might bring Artist Mo to our company?

706
00:48:23,031 --> 00:48:24,191
That's correct.

707
00:48:24,191 --> 00:48:26,321
PD Kwon, since you know Artist Mo the best,

708
00:48:26,321 --> 00:48:29,101
- please draft the proposal.
 - Okay, I got it.

709
00:48:29,101 --> 00:48:31,561
Let's prepare for the meeting together.

710
00:48:31,561 --> 00:48:33,621
PD On, what happened to "Peeve Weapon"?

711
00:48:33,621 --> 00:48:36,161
We'll have a meeting with the production company soon.

712
00:48:36,161 --> 00:48:38,441
Please update me right away as things move forward.

713
00:48:38,441 --> 00:48:39,751
PD Gi?

714
00:48:39,751 --> 00:48:42,771
I posted the draft promotion proposal for

715
00:48:42,771 --> 00:48:44,601
Artist Yeo Tae Gu's paperback publication.

716
00:48:44,601 --> 00:48:49,051
Deputy Editor already approved it, so we'll proceed once you confirm as well.

717
00:48:49,051 --> 00:48:51,601
Okay, I'll look into it.

718
00:48:51,601 --> 00:48:54,281
I'll also meet with Artist Oh Yun about the new series proposal

719
00:48:54,281 --> 00:48:56,331
along with PD On Ma Eum and PD Gu Jun Yeong.

720
00:48:56,331 --> 00:48:57,331
That's great.

721
00:48:57,331 --> 00:48:58,971
How is Artist Pomme doing?

722
00:48:58,971 --> 00:49:01,931
I asked her again, but she said she'll be able to continue without a break.

723
00:49:01,931 --> 00:49:03,121
I appreciate that.

724
00:49:03,121 --> 00:49:05,451
Everyone's sailing smoothly.

725
00:49:05,451 --> 00:49:08,351
Let's fight on until the end with this momentum!

726
00:49:08,351 --> 00:49:09,591
Okay!

727
00:49:09,591 --> 00:49:11,851
Thanks for your time.

728
00:49:13,981 --> 00:49:16,311
 I'll give you one last chance. 

729
00:49:16,311 --> 00:49:17,971
 Based on the data, 

730
00:49:17,971 --> 00:49:22,971
 bring me a report that concludes that it's more profitable to acquire Young Toon. 

731
00:49:33,081 --> 00:49:36,201
 Additional Report Data 

732
00:49:36,201 --> 00:49:37,701
Okay.

733
00:49:48,681 --> 00:49:50,421
Jun Yeong.

734
00:49:56,381 --> 00:50:00,341
What's that thing you said you wanted to tell me?

735
00:50:02,131 --> 00:50:04,141
I'll tell you later.

736
00:50:04,141 --> 00:50:06,041
Is it that important?

737
00:50:06,041 --> 00:50:07,661
Yeah.

738
00:50:07,661 --> 00:50:10,751
I want to tell you after I'm ready to tell you.

739
00:50:11,641 --> 00:50:14,981
Hey, you're making it sound like a love confession.

740
00:50:26,451 --> 00:50:27,921
Would you like to place your order?

741
00:50:27,921 --> 00:50:31,441
One moment, please. One person has not arrived yet.

742
00:50:32,581 --> 00:50:35,441
Is someone else joining us?

743
00:50:37,081 --> 00:50:39,391
Looks like she's here.

744
00:50:41,281 --> 00:50:42,581
Now, please say hi to each other.

745
00:50:42,581 --> 00:50:46,351
This is Young Toon's CEO, Kim Yeong Shin.

746
00:50:47,431 --> 00:50:52,311
This is Mr. Gu Jun Yeong, helping me from within the Neon Webtoon Team.

747
00:50:52,311 --> 00:50:54,311
Nice to meet you.

748
00:50:55,131 --> 00:50:57,451
How do you do?

749
00:50:57,451 --> 00:51:00,241
You must treasure this fellow a lot

750
00:51:00,241 --> 00:51:02,131
for you to arrange a meeting like this.

751
00:51:02,131 --> 00:51:04,561
Well, it's going to be game-over tomorrow, but

752
00:51:04,561 --> 00:51:06,411
it's good for people who are going to work together

753
00:51:06,411 --> 00:51:08,961
to get hand in hand with each other in advance.

754
00:51:11,541 --> 00:51:14,381
What do you mean by "game-over"?

755
00:51:14,381 --> 00:51:16,721
There's something like that.

756
00:51:26,418 --> 00:51:28,741
Hey, you never buy what I pick out for you.

757
00:51:28,741 --> 00:51:30,089
Why do you always take me along?

758
00:51:30,089 --> 00:51:31,999
Geez, so noisy.

759
00:51:32,858 --> 00:51:35,381
You take me along as your porter, huh?

760
00:51:35,381 --> 00:51:38,271
Bingo.

761
00:51:38,271 --> 00:51:39,141
Huh? Your coworker.

762
00:51:39,141 --> 00:51:40,699
Stop changing the subject. What coworker?

763
00:51:40,699 --> 00:51:42,449
No, seriously.

764
00:51:43,061 --> 00:51:44,991
You're right.

765
00:51:44,991 --> 00:51:46,041
Right?

766
00:51:46,041 --> 00:51:50,201
I recognized him right away because his face was glowing.

767
00:51:50,931 --> 00:51:52,221
Why...

768
00:51:52,221 --> 00:51:55,271
CEO Kim, please take good care of Mr. Gu Jun Yeong.

769
00:51:55,271 --> 00:51:57,421
I'm the one to ask for his care.

770
00:51:57,421 --> 00:51:59,431
I'll also be in your care.

771
00:51:59,431 --> 00:52:02,241
Gosh, looking good, you two.

772
00:52:12,031 --> 00:52:13,921
Eonni.

773
00:52:13,921 --> 00:52:15,851
Should we go and say hi?

774
00:52:15,851 --> 00:52:19,081
Huh? No, no, no.

775
00:52:19,081 --> 00:52:20,261
Why not?

776
00:52:20,261 --> 00:52:21,721
Let's go.

777
00:52:21,721 --> 00:52:23,931
Why? I mean...

778
00:52:47,171 --> 00:52:49,211
Wait a minute.

779
00:52:49,211 --> 00:52:52,921
What... is this article saying?

780
00:52:52,921 --> 00:52:55,091
Is something wrong?

781
00:52:57,631 --> 00:52:58,961
Why? What is it?

782
00:52:58,961 --> 00:53:00,741
I mean...

783
00:53:01,891 --> 00:53:03,661
 Neon Content Director Heo Kwan Yeong Pushes for Aggressive Mergers and Acquisitions of K-content Companies, Such As Young Toon 

784
00:53:03,661 --> 00:53:05,721
Why an article like this?

785
00:53:18,521 --> 00:53:21,021
 Kim Yeong Sin, CEO of Young Toon 

786
00:53:21,021 --> 00:53:22,591
 She's... 

787
00:53:22,591 --> 00:53:24,471
 I'm the one to ask for his care. 

788
00:53:24,471 --> 00:53:26,941
 Looking good, you two. 

789
00:53:35,291 --> 00:53:37,301
 Neon Content Director Heo Kwan Yeong Pushes for Aggressive Mergers and Acquisitions of K-content Companies, Such As Young Toon 

790
00:53:37,301 --> 00:53:39,771
Cool tones certainly make me look good.

791
00:53:39,771 --> 00:53:43,061
Whoa. That's right.

792
00:53:59,061 --> 00:54:01,171
Yes, it's me.

793
00:54:01,171 --> 00:54:04,471
Who the heck arranged Heo Kwan Yeong's interview?

794
00:54:09,641 --> 00:54:12,671
 Artist Mo Yeong Su 

795
00:54:17,361 --> 00:54:19,311
Yes, Artist Mo.

796
00:54:19,911 --> 00:54:22,751
Are you kidding me right now?

797
00:54:22,751 --> 00:54:24,331
No, h-how could I ever?

798
00:54:24,331 --> 00:54:28,291
A-Artist Mo, I-I'll see you in person and explain.

799
00:54:28,291 --> 00:54:30,081
You got me not once but twice.

800
00:54:30,081 --> 00:54:34,761
I've never seen a company that does their business in such a deceptive way in my life.

801
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:39,000
- Don't contact me.
 - A-Artist Mo, o-one moment! Artist Mo!

802
00:54:55,691 --> 00:54:57,701
I'll go see him.

803
00:55:11,101 --> 00:55:14,071
What exactly are you doing?

804
00:55:14,071 --> 00:55:18,801
Is there a M&amp;A  (merger and acquisition)  going on in this company that I don't know about?

805
00:55:19,641 --> 00:55:23,821
That was the journalist overreacting by himself.

806
00:55:23,821 --> 00:55:25,361
I only said...

807
00:55:25,361 --> 00:55:30,101
"We're considering several content companies for aggressive M&amp;A."

808
00:55:30,101 --> 00:55:32,391
That's all I said.

809
00:55:33,331 --> 00:55:37,501
However, isn't that a fact, CEO?

810
00:55:46,251 --> 00:55:49,471
I'll order a correction article right away.

811
00:55:51,071 --> 00:55:53,821
Hey, Director Heo Kwan Yeong.

812
00:55:53,821 --> 00:55:57,431
I'm not sure what you're scheming right now,

813
00:55:57,431 --> 00:56:02,931
but I won't be sitting quietly anymore with your schemes.

814
00:56:02,931 --> 00:56:06,561
Would I ever dare do that to you, CEO?

815
00:56:20,131 --> 00:56:24,071
Who was the one to scheme first?

816
00:56:24,071 --> 00:56:27,791
That's why you should've protected them in moderation.

817
00:56:29,061 --> 00:56:30,941
Director.

818
00:56:33,771 --> 00:56:35,671
Isn't this too much?

819
00:56:35,671 --> 00:56:37,471
What's this?

820
00:56:39,811 --> 00:56:41,291
That article?

821
00:56:41,291 --> 00:56:43,301
There will be a correction article soon.

822
00:56:43,301 --> 00:56:45,391
You've done quite a bit by stirring the pot.

823
00:56:45,391 --> 00:56:48,491
Do things take care of themselves with a correction article?

824
00:56:49,241 --> 00:56:51,590
What will you do about our employees who feel defeated and

825
00:56:51,590 --> 00:56:55,140
artists who are confused because of that single article?

826
00:56:58,881 --> 00:57:00,971
What do you mean what will I do?

827
00:57:00,971 --> 00:57:04,521
You need to clean things up, Chief Editor Jang Man Cheol.

828
00:57:04,521 --> 00:57:09,951
That's why you're in your position.

829
00:57:18,951 --> 00:57:21,031
 It's strange no matter how I look at it. 

830
00:57:21,031 --> 00:57:26,191
 He always throws a wrench when I feel like we've hit rock bottom. 

831
00:57:26,191 --> 00:57:28,291
 Heo Kwan Yeong... 

832
00:57:31,411 --> 00:57:32,851
 What brings you to the headquarters? 

833
00:57:32,851 --> 00:57:35,321
 I have some files to deliver. 

834
00:57:37,551 --> 00:57:39,501
 PD Gu. 

835
00:57:47,401 --> 00:57:51,441
No, nothing has been decided.

836
00:57:51,441 --> 00:57:56,201
Also, a M &amp; A is not something that happens overnight.

837
00:57:56,201 --> 00:58:00,061
Of course, our series aren't affected at all for a while.

838
00:58:00,061 --> 00:58:01,821
GingerToon...

839
00:58:01,821 --> 00:58:03,681
GingerToon?  Why would you bring that up again?

840
00:58:03,681 --> 00:58:06,591
Something like that would never happen. Please don't worry.

841
00:58:06,591 --> 00:58:10,411
Geez, because of that article...

842
00:58:10,411 --> 00:58:12,871
I'm so upset right now.

843
00:58:12,871 --> 00:58:18,771
Why does Director Heo release an article like that right before the contract signing with Artist Mo?

844
00:58:21,551 --> 00:58:23,411
Exactly.

845
00:58:32,791 --> 00:58:35,341
 Heo Kwan Yeong 

846
00:58:55,331 --> 00:58:57,041
Where did Jun Yeong go?

847
00:58:57,041 --> 00:58:59,111
We have our meeting.

848
00:59:01,041 --> 00:59:03,221
I'll go get him.

849
00:59:20,931 --> 00:59:23,091
What was the M&amp;A article about all of a sudden?

850
00:59:23,091 --> 00:59:25,251
Surprise.

851
00:59:25,251 --> 00:59:29,711
I was a little anxious relying on your loyalty.

852
00:59:29,711 --> 00:59:35,251
You could say that it's a minimum safety measure to prevent the tables from turning.

853
00:59:37,391 --> 00:59:39,171
Open it.

854
00:59:48,961 --> 00:59:51,061
How is the mood inside the office?

855
00:59:51,061 --> 00:59:55,951
 This is even more reason to secure the physical evidence showing his motive. 

856
00:59:55,951 --> 00:59:58,971
Everyone is taken aback,

857
00:59:58,971 --> 01:00:01,471
so things are pretty hectic.

858
01:00:01,471 --> 01:00:04,881
I'm glad the surprise gift served its purpose.

859
01:00:20,711 --> 01:00:23,321
What are you doing? Open it.

860
01:00:23,321 --> 01:00:24,765
Okay.

861
01:00:56,380 --> 01:01:06,330


862
01:01:07,580 --> 01:01:11,300
♫  Come to me at least once  ♫

863
01:01:13,060 --> 01:01:16,590
♫  Try running until you're out of breath  ♫

864
01:01:18,930 --> 01:01:22,290
♫  Come to me at least once  ♫

865
01:01:24,420 --> 01:01:27,820
♫  Try smiling once with me  ♫

866
01:01:34,930 --> 01:01:38,020
 Today's Webtoon 

867
01:01:38,020 --> 01:01:42,450
 The most important thing is to prevent the artists from leaving. 

868
01:01:42,450 --> 01:01:44,640
 Nothing is coming to my mind. 

869
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:49,150
 It feels like my head is completely blank and empty. 

870
01:01:49,150 --> 01:01:50,730
 Get out! 

871
01:01:50,730 --> 01:01:54,020
 I can't endure any longer. 

872
01:01:54,020 --> 01:01:57,710
 Do you still think that you're you and a separate entity from the team? 

873
01:01:57,710 --> 01:01:59,620
 Am I not allowed to? 

874
01:01:59,620 --> 01:02:02,280
 It seems more precarious than before. 

875
01:02:02,280 --> 01:02:04,960
 As though you carry the entire burdens of the world, 

876
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:10,810
 why do you struggle running alone? Weren't we all running together? 

877
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:18,900
♫  The many obstacles which blocked you have all disappeared  ♫
