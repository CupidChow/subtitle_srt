1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:06,970


2
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:34,120
 Today's Webtoon 

3
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:38,030
I beg you.

4
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:42,170
"Gumiho Princess" 213th episode. Please redraw it.

5
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:47,030
I can't even sleep every day.

6
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm shortening my life span as I draw.

7
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,910
I drew my a** off until my whole body became a rag, so don't ramble on like that.

8
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:59,340
Are you sure you aren't  being childish?

9
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:05,930
The readers will not be excited with this manuscript.

10
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:07,460
"With this"?

11
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:09,900
How dare a newbie like you ramble on like that!

12
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,100
I know it the best!

13
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:15,460
Until recently, I was your passionate fan

14
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:18,410
and an ordinary reader.

15
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:20,170
It won't work like this.

16
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:23,200
Even if you end up hating me, I have to say what I have to say.

17
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:28,580
"Gumiho Princess" that I love is absolutely not a webtoon of such low quality.

18
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:35,320
When a typical reader On Ma Eum saw this manuscript,

19
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,230
she would've been disappointed for sure.

20
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:39,560
She waited and waited for one week.

21
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:43,850
If the story is no different than last week, do you know how disappointing that is?

22
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,360
Artist Na that I know

23
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:51,690
drew much better comics than the manuscript you gave me today.

24
00:01:57,980 --> 00:01:59,980
Is it that bad?

25
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:03,260
Yes!

26
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:04,370
Really?

27
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:06,740
Revise the manuscript by tomorrow.

28
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:08,860
Please, I beg you.

29
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:15,370
I will wait, Artist Na!

30
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:22,030
I will wait, Artist Na!

31
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,680
 I didn't have a chance to tell you this earlier. 

32
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:02,010
 Please review the ad banner concepts for the homepage also. 

33
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,910
Come on, seriously?

34
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:09,400
But I have to...

35
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,830
I'll do it. I'll do it.

36
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:50,700
Geez! Why are you doing this to me?

37
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,200
I am telling you I will redraw! I will revise it.

38
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,650
I will revise it.

39
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:56,150
I will draw that great comic that you talked about,

40
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:58,480
so shut up and just wait!

41
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,440
Ta-da! Surprise!

42
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:04,900
I went to the spa and shopping.

43
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:10,080
Han Seul!

44
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:13,250
What's wrong, Honey?

45
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,830
Honey...

46
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:23,310
Episode 4: The talented one will become a slave to the talent.

47
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:27,590
Ma Eum, aren't you going home?

48
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:30,890
I asked Artist Na for a new manuscript.

49
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:34,380
He's going to work all night so I can't bear to go home by myself.

50
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:36,310
So, you are going to spend all night here?

51
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:39,620
It's not like Artist Na will acknowledge you for doing this.

52
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:42,330
That's good thinking.

53
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:44,380
Oh, yeah, and

54
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:48,300
call him every now and then and check if he's on top of the deadline.

55
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:49,930
Yes, sir.

56
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:57,640
It seems Deputy Editor is trying to have you grow strong.

57
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,120
- Take it easy.  
- Thank you.

58
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,450
Good night.

59
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:02,630
- Good night. 
 - Good night.

60
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:07,890
Aren't you leaving, Jun Yeong?

61
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:09,870
You read that already?

62
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:13,100
Yes, I read it fast because it was so much fun.

63
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:15,010
Give them to me. I'll return them tomorrow.

64
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:18,830
No, I will go and return them myself today.

65
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:21,500
I want to check out other comic books as well.

66
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,030
What?

67
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:26,200
Have you become interested in comic books?

68
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,960
A little.

69
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:31,700
Then, I will organize the recommended list and send it to you.

70
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:35,830
And I will give you a discount for our comic book cafe.

71
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:38,110
- Why?
 - What do you mean why?

72
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:39,420
Because you are my only colleague.

73
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:40,960
VVIP.

74
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,240
Very very important person, right?

75
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,000
Me?

76
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:53,430
I'll get going now. Take it easy.

77
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:54,890
Jun Yeong.

78
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:59,540
Please pray that our Artist Na can meet the deadline.

79
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:03,340
Goodbye.

80
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:11,770
Hello, Director.

81
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:13,410
Yes.

82
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:16,470
Right, right...

83
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:18,630
Go ahead and wait for me outside.

84
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:20,800
I think I interviewed you.

85
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,000
Right?

86
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,870
Your name is...

87
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:26,800
Gu Jun Yeong?

88
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:30,510
- Yes. 
 - Which team are you on now?

89
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:32,670
I'm on the Webtoon Service Team.

90
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:34,690
Webtoon.

91
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:37,840
Aigoo, how did you end up there?

92
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:40,970
What brings you to the main corporate office?

93
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:44,090
- I needed a signature on a contract.
 - Come on...

94
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:47,640
You are not the type of person to do that kind of job.

95
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:51,130
Didn't you originally apply for the Service Planning Team?

96
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:52,810
Yes, that's right.

97
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:54,600
But...

98
00:06:56,070 --> 00:07:01,230
why did they assign you to that team out of all places?

99
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:19,710
♫  Walking  ♫

100
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:22,970
♫  I'm walking down the street  ♫

101
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:27,110
♫  I walked the fastest  ♫

102
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:31,040
♫  Running  ♫

103
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:34,230
♫  I'm running down the street  ♫

104
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:38,490
♫  Confidently opening the path  ♫

105
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:44,030
♫  I couldn't see the end of the day,   ♫

106
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:49,870
♫   but today the day opened up again  ♫

107
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:58,200
♫  All the obstacles that blocked you, although tough,  ♫

108
00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:01,340
♫  will all disappear  ♫

109
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:09,310
♫  Come to me next time  ♫

110
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:18,720
The webtoon team is a ticking bomb. You know that, right?

111
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,480
Yes.

112
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:24,840
We have to handle disposing of a team like that very carefully.

113
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:28,730
You can't let the bomb explode.

114
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:31,270
You have to defuse it well.

115
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:40,900
 The bomb disposal team. 

116
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,620
 Do you want to give it a try? 

117
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:44,570
 You, Gu Jun Yeong. 

118
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:45,570
Excuse me?

119
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:49,640
You have to work in our main office soon.

120
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:52,060
What do you mean?

121
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:53,990
Well...

122
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:55,680
I know you heard everything.

123
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,750
Why are you pretending as if you didn't get it?

124
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:00,460
I won't repeat myself.

125
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:02,870
- Don't do it if you don't want to. 
 -  It's not that. Well...

126
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:04,860
Contact me after you think about it.

127
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:09,410
But... you shouldn't take too long.

128
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:11,180
Sometimes in life,

129
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:15,840
the timing of a decision is more crucial than the decision itself.

130
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:55,220
 A new villain appears! The betrayal of an ally... 

131
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,920
 Na Gang Nam: Here you go. The new manuscript. 

132
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:54,630
  After you look at this, don't mess with me. Got that? 

133
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:02,060
 A weak man like this is too easy... 
 Bring me someone stronger. 

134
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,470
 -  Let's go together. 
 - Whatever. 

135
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:15,720
 Tae Jun smells worse!‎ 

136
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,300
Daebak!

137
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:37,430
Artist Na is a genius.

138
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:14,350
I'll never... be weak.

139
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,910
At least, in the comics.

140
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:36,130
Did you receive the manuscript?

141
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,990
How is it?

142
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:40,400
It's crazy good...

143
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:43,750
I got goosebumps.

144
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:47,490
Good.

145
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:49,040
Job well done.

146
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,690
- Should we go eat?
 - Eat?

147
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:53,310
Thank you! Enjoy your meal.

148
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:55,840
- Let's eat.
- Yes, sir.

149
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:58,230
 Hangover soup‎ 

150
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:03,700
If you stay up all night, don't you lose appetite in the morning?

151
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,590
Like getting stomach pains?

152
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:10,000
As for me, I have never felt something like that in my whole life.

153
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:15,380
Instead, eating after the deadline is over, it tastes like honey.

154
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:16,810
Are you the one who met the deadline?

155
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:19,620
I did it together with him in my heart.

156
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:22,700
Okay, let's do it effortlessly in the future.

157
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:26,760
What a fuss every time there's an upload for "Gumiho Princess."

158
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:33,750
I apologize.

159
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:36,670
For what?

160
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:41,880
For insisting on proceeding with Artist Na's initial manuscript without revision.

161
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:44,870
I was wrong.

162
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:49,530
I realized it more after reading the revised manuscript.

163
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:52,140
That he could achieve much more.

164
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:56,170
I was being too lenient to let it slide and

165
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:59,350
both the work and Artist Na almost got ruined.

166
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:03,380
You have great learning abilities.

167
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:05,320
You realized many things at once.

168
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:08,980
This is all thanks to your nagging, Deputy Editor.

169
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:10,590
I see.

170
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:15,170
These days, people say that's nagging so bluntly?

171
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,980
No, I just

172
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:19,620
said it was nagging, huh? No, no, no.

173
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:21,770
Well, um...

174
00:14:21,770 --> 00:14:23,840
They call it a "tip."

175
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,120
Teaching.

176
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,590
Yes, teaching.

177
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:29,680
It's a tough job, huh?

178
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,330
Yes!

179
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:37,040
But still, I think this job makes me happy.

180
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,130
What does?

181
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:40,750
What makes you so happy?

182
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,310
That I can be...

183
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:45,770
the first reader for the comic that I love.

184
00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:47,110
Hey!

185
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,400
Let's eat.

186
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,040
Yes, sir!

187
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,290
Do you usually eat this well?

188
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:55,270
Didn't you watch me eat before?

189
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:58,200
How could I have seen you eat before?

190
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:03,180
 Gumiho Princess 

191
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:32,940
- It's up.
 - It's up?

192
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:33,780
Yeah.

193
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:35,870
- Is this it?
 - Okay, okay.

194
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:48,630
 Gumiho Princess 

195
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:53,930
Mom? What are you doing?

196
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:56,460
Nu Ri, can you take a look?

197
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:57,950
"Gumiho Princess"?

198
00:15:57,950 --> 00:16:01,390
Isn't it going to be over with the same story again?

199
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:04,750
Let's see...

200
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:05,980
What's this?

201
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:07,230
What happened?

202
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:09,100
Why? Is it boring? Is it bad?

203
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:12,360
- I am home. 
 - Hey.

204
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:15,380
Today's "Gumiho Princess" is awesome.

205
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:16,500
What?

206
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,510
The story is crazy good.

207
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:22,070
- I'm glad! So glad! 
 - You saw it? Is it fun?

208
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:27,070
Artist Na can write like this, and why did he drag it out all this time?

209
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:28,290
What do you mean drag it out?

210
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:30,710
He was building up to an explosion.

211
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:34,390
What's this? Since you are the managing PD, are you taking his side?

212
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:37,310
- Yes, that's right. So what, so what? 
 - Wow!

213
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:41,360
That webtoon witch or whatever. She won't last long, right?

214
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,760
Why are you asking me?

215
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,640
I don't know.

216
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:48,150
Mom! It was so tough!

217
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:50,020
Great job!

218
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:52,040
Thank you.

219
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:55,000
 That's Artist Na! 

220
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,700
 This episode is so fun! 

221
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:58,100
 This is why everyone is talking about "Gumiho Princess." 

222
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,480
 - The story is so freaking fun. 
  - I take back saying it was boring. 

223
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,870
 I'm looking forward to the next episode. 

224
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:05,000
PD On Ma Eum sent this.

225
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,080
Here.

226
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:09,540
What pretty flowers.

227
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:13,100
That's our Mandu. She's so sensible.

228
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:14,830
Our Mandu?

229
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:17,550
Since when did she become "our Mandu"?

230
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:27,430
 Artist Na, thank you for putting together wonderful work. 

231
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:30,250
 I was emotionally moved after reading the latest episode. 

232
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:33,790
 You hate me a lot right now, right? 

233
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:38,380
 But I will be courageous enough to be hated by you 

234
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:41,310
 and keep bugging you. 

235
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:45,430
 I lack in many ways, but I am looking forward to continuing to work with you. 

236
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:47,940
 From PD On Ma Eum. 

237
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:51,980
You think I'd fall for such a bribe so easily?

238
00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:57,070
So rude!

239
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:58,910
Jjim Mandu (Steamed dumpling).

240
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:04,010
Hey, what are you doing?

241
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:05,840
Go away.

242
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,390
Move out of the way.

243
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:18,100
Come on, move out of the way, so I can go.

244
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:19,960
Gosh. Aigoo!

245
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,480
Excuse me.

246
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,680
What are you doing?

247
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:31,510
The grandpa is uncomfor—

248
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:36,450
He's uncomfortable with you.

249
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:43,030
That expression...

250
00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:46,720
is interesting.

251
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:51,490
What are you...

252
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:55,250
doing?

253
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:09,870
Do you need some help?

254
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:13,830
No, no. It's okay. Aigoo, it's okay.

255
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:15,830
Gosh, you are so kind.

256
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:18,680
Okay. Thanks for your help.

257
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:22,890
 Webtoon Camp? 

258
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:24,850
Is there a point to this?

259
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:29,000
We get many new pieces of work from webtoon auditions anyway.

260
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,410
Why bother using up offline resources to do it?

261
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:36,470
Yes, we also offer new artist mentoring.

262
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:38,270
So it's a good opportunity to find a diamond in the rough.

263
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:41,680
- It's also good for company image—
- Look, Team Leader Jang.

264
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:45,900
We talk in numbers at the company.

265
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:49,380
We need ROI*. ROI (return on investment).

266
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:53,890
It takes at least one or two years for a newly-found talent to produce.

267
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:57,070
Do you have that kind of time, Team Leader Jang?

268
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,900
Established artists are good, but

269
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:05,020
we can hit a jackpot and discover a priceless artist at the Webtoon Camp.

270
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:09,570
There's a low probability, but we can try to scratch off the lottery ticket...

271
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:12,870
And what if it fails again?

272
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:16,720
Will you take responsibility for the loss?

273
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:19,960
I will take responsibility.

274
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,890
How?

275
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:26,950
 Names of artists / genre 

276
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:28,950
Wow. Again?

277
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:31,110
It's all boring or just so so.

278
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:33,950
It looks like there are no decent newbie artists this month.

279
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,020
Is it just this month? It's been several months now.

280
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:40,400
Webtoon Camp. How's the Webtoon Camp preparation going?

281
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:44,530
Yes, we're working with our webtoon audition artists to review the portfolio applicants.

282
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:45,920
Who are going to be the mentors?

283
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,920
Artist Baek Eo Jin and Artist Oh Yoon.

284
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:50,890
How about Pomme? Pomme will get more media attention.

285
00:21:50,890 --> 00:21:55,760
Gosh, that'd be great, but she's not an easy artist to persuade.

286
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,580
Jun Yeong.

287
00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:00,480
Do you think you can convince her?

288
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:03,000
- Me?
 - Of course.

289
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,210
You are the managing PD, Gu Jun Yeong. Right?

290
00:22:06,210 --> 00:22:09,890
Didn't you fail to persuade her last year and the year before that, PD Kwon?

291
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:11,870
I can't remember.

292
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:18,920
If we do it like last year or the year before that, this camp can be our last camp.

293
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:29,100
What I'm saying is, this is not a camp where we just eat and play.

294
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:34,420
So, prepare diligently and let's select a great newcomer.

295
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:36,590
- Gu Jun Yeong and On Ma Eum. 
 - Yes?

296
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:39,460
Stay at the camp with the Deputy Editor.

297
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:43,280
Other PDs should also visit frequently and check status.

298
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,830
PD Kwon, your ability is desperately needed this time.

299
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:50,040
Please be mindful. Okay?

300
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,640
Prepare the list, and let's meet again.

301
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,330
Wh-Why is everyone so down?

302
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:56,610
Now! Let's do it right this time!

303
00:22:56,610 --> 00:22:58,990
Aim for a home run!

304
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:05,700
Aim for the jaws of victory!

305
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:07,390
Th-That's right.

306
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:09,710
For the win... win.

307
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:11,970
Aim for the jaws of victory!

308
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:14,100
Aim for the jaws of victory!

309
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:16,310
- Yeah!
 - Okay.

310
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:18,920
- Prepare diligently, okay? 
 - Yes!

311
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:21,270
Between 4 or 5 o'clock.

312
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:26,850
Hyeong, what does it mean this can be our last camp?

313
00:23:26,850 --> 00:23:27,790
What?

314
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:29,940
- What? 
 - You said that earlier in the meeting.

315
00:23:30,930 --> 00:23:33,050
Oh, that's...

316
00:23:38,130 --> 00:23:40,840
I don't think they'll support us anymore.

317
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:43,860
They invested three years without a positive outcome.

318
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:45,610
I see.

319
00:23:45,610 --> 00:23:47,630
That's what you meant?

320
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:50,820
I thought there was something else going on.

321
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:52,730
Finish smoking.

322
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,780
No, I don't want to.

323
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:00,470
Why not?

324
00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:02,540
What's the point of going?

325
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:05,200
It only causes people to gossip about me.

326
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,980
And aspiring webtoon artists will criticize me so much when they see me.

327
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:12,100
They'll be envious and show jealousy.

328
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:14,700
(They)* love you.
(He does not say the subject/pronoun)

329
00:24:16,970 --> 00:24:21,100
- What? 
- There are many people who love you.

330
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:26,180
Why do you always focus only on people who hate you?

331
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:33,110
We need you for our camp so I came to ask you to join us.

332
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:35,410
But I won't ask you anymore.

333
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:42,410
- But let me give you some advice instead. 
 - Advice?

334
00:24:42,410 --> 00:24:45,490
I think you should come to the camp for your benefit.

335
00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:48,050
They admire and envy you.

336
00:24:48,050 --> 00:24:50,860
There are so many people who want to become like you.

337
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:53,770
Come to the camp and see it for yourself.

338
00:24:53,770 --> 00:24:59,280
I may be crossing the line here, but I think you will need it going forward.

339
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:07,030
 Love You, Four Musketeers 

340
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:11,630
 Peeve Weapon, Sin Dae Ryuk 

341
00:25:12,890 --> 00:25:16,400
 Argh! 

342
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,900
This is Lee Yu Jin I mentioned previously.

343
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:46,270
Next...

344
00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:49,450
Sin Dae Ryuk.

345
00:25:53,770 --> 00:25:55,360
 Summary 

346
00:25:55,360 --> 00:26:00,650
 Character Design  
 But this one is too amateurish, isn't it?

347
00:26:01,610 --> 00:26:04,060
It's an artist I recommended.

348
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:07,620
The drawings are still green, but it's mysteriously fun.

349
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:09,460
The story is also very refreshing.

350
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:12,770
I would like to see who the artist is in person.

351
00:26:12,770 --> 00:26:16,290
- Really? Can you guarantee? 
 - Excuse me?

352
00:26:16,290 --> 00:26:19,010
Can you guarantee that this artist has potential?

353
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:21,720
Or do you just want to see him?

354
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:24,860
This one spot can't be taken lightly.

355
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:27,020
What if you recommend him and the other person who missed the opportunity

356
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:30,600
is a daebak artist who would've made tons of money for our company?

357
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:33,220
Are you sure about your judgment?

358
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:44,240
You don't even have that much certainty and are pushing for this sucky artist?

359
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:52,090
Rather than say he sucks, it would be nice to consider him as unique.

360
00:26:53,290 --> 00:26:54,990
Hey, you.

361
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:58,010
You're just a newbie. How dare you press forward like that?

362
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:01,720
"Hey, you"?

363
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:06,700
The storyline definitely pulls you in.

364
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:10,320
The setting and the energy are pretty mysterious.

365
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:13,160
- Really?
 - Yes.

366
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:16,980
So I wonder if we can put more weight on the storyline

367
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:20,630
and refine the drawings as we move forward.

368
00:27:21,530 --> 00:27:23,730
 Sung Lim University Hospital 

369
00:27:51,410 --> 00:27:55,550
 Sin Dae Ryuk 

370
00:27:59,530 --> 00:28:02,480
I thought he'd pass away soon but he's hanging on for a long time.

371
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,040
You are going through a lot, Honey.

372
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:07,500
But we have to keep trying.

373
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:10,020
It's just hard on you.

374
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:11,780
I'm not the only one.

375
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:13,130
Right.

376
00:28:13,130 --> 00:28:15,660
Let's hang in there.

377
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:10,240
Were you drawing cartoons again?

378
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:13,940
I heard it's hard to get hired. How come you don't have a sense of urgency?

379
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:16,440
Don't expect me to support you for a long time while you look for a job.

380
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:19,320
Think about how you are going to live on your own.

381
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:22,400
Aigoo, I'm so frustrated. That stupid cartoon.

382
00:29:26,710 --> 00:29:31,630
 I wonder how many people have jobs that they love doing. 

383
00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:33,750
 Especially, being a webtoon artist 

384
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:38,360
 is a job that is limited to very few who are extremely talented. 

385
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:44,110
 For people like me, it may be more suitable to enjoy as a hobby. 

386
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:54,080
 NEON: Congratulations on becoming a participant in the webtoon camp. 

387
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:05,340
 No, maybe I can be one of the very few. 

388
00:30:11,790 --> 00:30:15,870
 Chungma Study Dorm 

389

 Webtoon Camp Acceptance Message 

391
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:02,790
Jun Yeong. What about Artist Pomme?

392
00:31:02,790 --> 00:31:04,830
Did she accept being a mentor for the Webtoon Camp?

393
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:07,620
Not yet. She said she needs more time to think.

394
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:10,910
Really? Tell me in advance if you don't think it's going to happen.

395
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:12,770
I'll go visit her and try to persuade her myself.

396
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:15,230
I'll check with her right now.

397
00:31:19,610 --> 00:31:21,340
 Deal. 

398
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:25,310
Who is it? Artist Pomme?

399
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:27,720
Yes. She said she'll do it.

400
00:31:28,770 --> 00:31:32,090
Wow, PD Gu, you are awesome!

401
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:34,860
Whoa, how did you persuade her?

402
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:36,310
We all thought it wasn't going to happen.

403
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:39,990
I just asked her sincerely.

404
00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:43,510
Then she didn't feel sincerity from PD Kwon?

405
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:46,960
Maybe the answer is a handsome face?

406
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,460
Why?

407
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:49,970
What?

408
00:31:55,270 --> 00:31:57,030
Congratulations.

409
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:06,480
Three pairs of pants and and sleepwear.

410
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,730
And toiletries...

411
00:32:07,730 --> 00:32:09,600
Is it complete?

412
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,620
It's not complete.

413
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:12,960
Dad's coming home soon.

414
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:15,600
How are you going to cover up sleeping elsewhere for several days?

415
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,720
Is that this week?

416
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,530
I can just say I'm going on a trip.

417
00:32:21,530 --> 00:32:23,960
Are you stupid? He's been waiting for good timing.

418
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:26,650
He's going to drag you straight to the judo gym.

419
00:32:27,730 --> 00:32:30,210
What am I going to do?

420
00:32:30,210 --> 00:32:31,700
I will solve it.

421
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:33,920
Mom? How?

422
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:36,510
I have a solution.

423
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:39,500
Are you going to be all right?

424
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:41,730
Can't you trust your mom?

425
00:32:43,050 --> 00:32:44,670
I trust you.

426
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:49,270
It's perfect weather for the camp.

427
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,840
 PD Jang Hye Mi 

428
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,270
Hi, what's up?

429
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:01,970
I haven't called you in a long time.

430
00:33:01,970 --> 00:33:04,590
Can't you answer it with a warm welcome?

431
00:33:04,590 --> 00:33:05,860
Why did you call?

432
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:08,760
I had a meeting in your area and wanted to grab a cup of tea.

433
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:11,170
 I'm on a business trip. 

434
00:33:11,170 --> 00:33:15,540
By chance is it Webtoon Camp?

435
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:18,480
I sense that you called me knowing about it already.

436
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:21,800
No. It's obvious what type of business trips we have.

437
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:25,210
Don't force them to sign contracts just because they are good artists.

438
00:33:25,210 --> 00:33:29,220
And give up artists who match our company's flavor.

439
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:31,570
It seems like you already have artists you've got your eye on.

440
00:33:31,570 --> 00:33:35,740
Rather than that, I think you chose artists who are not to your taste.

441
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:39,570
You know my taste?

442
00:33:39,570 --> 00:33:44,690
No one else knows more about you than I do, Oppa.

443
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:46,450
Isn't that right?

444
00:33:59,490 --> 00:34:01,690
Maybe I shouldn't have called.

445
00:34:13,270 --> 00:34:14,930
Hello.

446
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:18,310
This way, please.

447
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:21,230
Hello.

448
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:23,590
Here you go. Thank you.

449
00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:25,330
Welcome!

450
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:28,540
 Testing, testing. 

451
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:31,210
Hello, my name is Seok Ji Hyeong, the manager for this camp.

452
00:34:31,210 --> 00:34:33,340
Nice to meet you all.

453
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:36,830
All right.

454
00:34:36,830 --> 00:34:43,650
What do we draw manwha ( (comics)  with?

455
00:34:43,650 --> 00:34:46,740
With our brain? With our heart?

456
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:48,950
With our hands?

457
00:34:48,950 --> 00:34:51,730
Yes. All of them are correct.

458
00:34:51,730 --> 00:34:58,910
But for me, I think comics are drawn with your butts.

459
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:05,360
For 365 days a year without rest,

460
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:10,080
the job that requires you to spend more than half of your days in the studio.

461
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:14,100
I think that's what comic artists are.

462
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:19,110
♫  Having deleted all the tough steps I  ♫

463
00:35:19,110 --> 00:35:21,090
♫  have a new dream  ♫

466
00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:30,510
♫  At the moment the darkness clears  ♫

467
00:35:30,510 --> 00:35:36,510
♫  in the warm wind full of sunshine  ♫

00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:55,980
 It's mysteriously fun. 

475
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:59,370
 The story is also very refreshing.
 

476
00:35:59,370 --> 00:36:04,430
♫  Follow the dispersing light  ♫

477

♫  I fly  ♫

478
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:28,310
 What are you doing? 

479
00:36:28,310 --> 00:36:30,770
 The grandpa is uncomfortable with you.
 

480
00:36:30,770 --> 00:36:31,980
No way.

481
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:35,200
 That expression is interesting. 

482
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:40,240
It's you!

483
00:36:40,970 --> 00:36:43,590
You drew about what happened last time, right?

484
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:46,080
 That expression is interesting 

485
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:48,840
Don't you remember meeting me?

486
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:56,300
That rude woman?

487
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:58,370
Me? M-Me? I was rude...

488
00:36:58,370 --> 00:36:59,810
What do you mean I'm rude?

489
00:36:59,810 --> 00:37:02,630
You were the one following people around and drawing them without consent.

490
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:04,440
That's even more rude.

491
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:09,030
I just wanted to draw live people's expressions.

492
00:37:09,030 --> 00:37:10,690
What?

493
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:16,040
All I see are sick or terminal patients

494
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:19,250
or expressionless doctors every day.

495
00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:21,960
I didn't know what to do while drawing cartoons.

496
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:26,870
What normal expressions and faces look like.

497
00:37:30,310 --> 00:37:31,940
I work at a hospital.

498
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:39,010
That's why you rashly followed people and drew their faces?

499
00:37:39,010 --> 00:37:40,500
Yes.

500
00:37:51,170 --> 00:37:53,210
"Peeve Weapon"...

501
00:37:55,230 --> 00:38:01,250
Then you are Artist Sin Dae Ryuk?

502
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:03,530
Yes.

503
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:06,060
Is there a problem?

504
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:14,820
I thought it was a weird cartoon but it drew me in for some reason.

505
00:38:15,950 --> 00:38:20,590
It's just a cartoon that a weirdo drew.

506
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:22,820
 Can you guarantee? 

507
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:25,230
 Can you guarantee that this artist has potential?
 

508
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:27,870
 Are you sure about your judgment?
 

509
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:53,710
Welcome, Artist.

510
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:57,830
Thank you for participating in our camp.

511
00:38:57,830 --> 00:38:59,860
Oh, sure.

512
00:39:03,810 --> 00:39:06,710
I don't see PD Gu Jun Yeong.

513
00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:10,090
PD Gu is currently organizing things inside.

514
00:39:10,090 --> 00:39:11,870
Let's go in first.

515
00:39:11,870 --> 00:39:13,530
Come close. Move forward?

516
00:39:13,530 --> 00:39:16,480
One, two, three.

517
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:18,800
Thank you so much!

518
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:21,850
You look more like a cartoon.

519
00:39:21,850 --> 00:39:24,170
- Thank you!
 - Okay, take care.

520
00:39:24,170 --> 00:39:26,250
Awesome!

521
00:39:28,430 --> 00:39:30,220
Hello.

522
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:32,520
Can I have your autograph?

523
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:34,350
You have my book.

524
00:39:34,350 --> 00:39:35,390
Yes.

525
00:39:35,390 --> 00:39:38,460
I'm a huge fan.

526
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:40,970
What's your name?

527
00:39:40,970 --> 00:39:42,080
It's Gu Seul Ah.

528
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:44,480
Gu Seul Ah?

529
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,650
Is it a pseudonym?

530
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:47,570
It's my real name.

531
00:39:47,570 --> 00:39:49,800
I don't have a pseudonym yet,

532
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:54,690
because I don't even know if I'll become a webtoon artist or not.

533
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,820
Why do you think that?

534
00:39:57,820 --> 00:40:00,960
I still lack skills.

535
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:04,240
I'm feeling that more while being here.

536
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:09,900
I wonder if people like me should just draw cartoons as a hobby.

537
00:40:12,730 --> 00:40:14,730
Take a seat for a second.

538
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:17,470
Okay.

539
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:22,400
Making that decision is not up to you.

540
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:23,460
What?

541
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:27,480
There is only one thing that you can decide.

542
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:32,960
Whether you set your goal to become a webtoon artist or not.

543
00:40:34,010 --> 00:40:38,800
The question you have to ask yourself is not, "Can I do this?",

544
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:46,300
but "Do I really want to do this?"

545
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:51,150
What do you think Gu Seul Ah?

546
00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:55,050
Do you really want to become a comic artist?

547
00:40:55,650 --> 00:40:57,060
Yes.

548
00:40:57,060 --> 00:41:00,580
I want to. Definitely.

549
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:09,990
"For your courage."

550
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:17,840
Fighting!

551
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:20,670
Fighting.

552
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:29,700
Nosebleed. Your nose is bleeding! Are you okay?

553
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:32,350
Oh, my God. Let me get some tissues.

554
00:41:41,070 --> 00:41:43,520
You weren't even sleeping last night.

555
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:47,850
If you continue in that state, you can be in big trouble.

556
00:41:47,850 --> 00:41:49,330
Yes.

557
00:41:49,330 --> 00:41:56,510
But this is the first time that I was given 24 hours just to draw.

558
00:41:56,510 --> 00:41:59,720
I'm not sure when I should take a break.

559
00:42:03,130 --> 00:42:04,560
Okay.

560
00:42:05,630 --> 00:42:07,400
Can you stand up?

561
00:42:09,010 --> 00:42:10,980
Okay. Follow me.

562
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:13,730
Like this. Put your hands like this.

563
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:18,900
One, two, three.

564
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:23,010
Opposite side too. Okay.

565
00:42:25,250 --> 00:42:29,300
One, two, three, four.

566
00:42:30,690 --> 00:42:32,790
It hurts too much.

567
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:38,470
Don't just keep working. Do some stretches every two to three hours.

568
00:42:38,470 --> 00:42:42,070
Stretch your body before getting back to work.

569
00:42:42,070 --> 00:42:43,560
Like this.

570
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:46,140
You neck is so stiff too—

571
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,380
Okay. I'll do it as you showed me.

572
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:57,400
The artist has to be healthy to complete the work.

573
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:00,710
Are you worrying about me?

574
00:43:00,710 --> 00:43:03,270
I thought you didn't like me.

575
00:43:06,090 --> 00:43:10,390
I'm just doing my job as a webtoon PD.

576
00:43:10,390 --> 00:43:12,860
And I don't just dislike people for no reason.

577
00:43:12,860 --> 00:43:17,080
That requires quite a lot of energy.

578
00:43:18,170 --> 00:43:19,750
Then,

579
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:25,320
the drawings that I'm working on, could you take a look?

580
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:26,800
What?

581
00:43:30,010 --> 00:43:32,300
Oh, okay.

582
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:36,300
I think it'd be good to show the character's emotions clearly through the drawing.

583
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:37,820
Thank you, Artist!

584
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:39,410
- Sure.
 - Excuse me,

585
00:43:39,410 --> 00:43:43,450
Could you autograph my tablet?

586
00:43:43,450 --> 00:43:44,810
- Right here?
 - Yes.

587
00:43:44,810 --> 00:43:49,330
I want to grasp your energy. I want to become like you.

588
00:43:51,540 --> 00:43:52,570
Like me?

589
00:43:52,570 --> 00:43:56,140
Yes. Artist Pomme, you are my role model.

590
00:44:49,970 --> 00:44:51,340
So,

591
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:55,840
this is a rough draft, right?

592
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:59,460
No. I finished drawing everything.

593
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:02,190
Oh, okay. Okay...

594
00:45:02,190 --> 00:45:04,470
You'll leave it black and white without any coloring?

595
00:45:04,470 --> 00:45:05,900
Yes.

596
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:11,220
So, the world I see isn't all that colorful.

597
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:15,750
So, the way I see things and how I feel. That's how I drew it.

598
00:45:17,990 --> 00:45:19,720
I see.

599
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:23,310
Does the story continue from what you submitted to the webtoon audition?

600
00:45:23,310 --> 00:45:26,560
Yes. This is a very long story.

601
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:29,450
Do you have the complete storyline worked out for that long story?

602
00:45:29,450 --> 00:45:32,690
Yes. It's in my head.

603
00:45:37,370 --> 00:45:38,420
 ‎Park Hui Yeong. 

604
00:45:38,420 --> 00:45:39,430
 Your mother died.‎ 

605
00:45:39,430 --> 00:45:40,700
 Because I couldn't miss it, my parent's trip ...‎ 

606
00:45:45,110 --> 00:45:47,180
 It's a car accident. You have to go to the hospital right away. 

607
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,700
What is this? I was curious from the beginning.

608
00:45:56,700 --> 00:45:58,360
That's Peeve.*
(Sounds like the word for skin in Korean.)

609
00:45:58,360 --> 00:45:59,470
Skin?

610
00:45:59,470 --> 00:46:01,690
No. Pee-ve.

611
00:46:01,690 --> 00:46:03,760
- Peeve? 
- Yes.

612
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:07,830
 It's a weapon that controls human potential. 

613
00:46:07,830 --> 00:46:13,100
 It's what comes out of people's fear or hatred. 

614
00:46:16,430 --> 00:46:18,100
Finally, I get to see you.

615
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:20,640
You're more glad to see me outside of your house, right?

616
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:22,620
Aren't you happy to have achieved your mission?

617
00:46:22,620 --> 00:46:27,510
I got many compliments thanks to you. Thank you.

618
00:46:27,510 --> 00:46:29,240
Still, it was fun.

619
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:34,490
Today, I met many people who told me I'm their role model.

620
00:46:34,490 --> 00:46:36,820
They all say they want to become like me.

621
00:46:36,820 --> 00:46:40,510
I think I should become happier.

622
00:46:40,510 --> 00:46:43,110
That's a good idea. Very much so.

623
00:46:43,110 --> 00:46:45,690
It's good that I came here, even for a day.

624
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:49,100
Thanks for inviting me, PD Gu.

625
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:51,010
You're welcome.

626
00:46:51,010 --> 00:46:52,150
 "Webtoon Camp" by Neon, Artist Pomme... 

627
00:46:52,150 --> 00:46:56,110
It looks like the Webtoon Camp is doing well this time around.

628
00:46:56,110 --> 00:46:58,380
We'll have to see if it can finish safe and sound.

629
00:46:58,380 --> 00:47:02,220
Most of all, their performance is more important.

630
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:07,090
You are especially uptight toward Team Leader Jang Man Cheol.

631
00:47:07,090 --> 00:47:12,370
Everything he does is so outdated, and I don't like it.

632
00:47:12,370 --> 00:47:16,760
Why did you hire Team Leader Jang, CEO?

633
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:19,970
During webtoon business acquisition, there were many other companies that were better.

634
00:47:19,970 --> 00:47:22,810
Instead, you brought people from GingerToon that failed—

635
00:47:22,810 --> 00:47:25,930
GingerToon didn't exactly fail.

636
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:30,650
The company forced them to terminate the service.

637
00:47:31,590 --> 00:47:36,020
That's the same thing. In the end, the service was terminated because of a low-profit margin.

638
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:38,750
You can't jump to that conclusion.

639
00:47:38,750 --> 00:47:40,390
Maybe someone

640
00:47:40,390 --> 00:47:46,520
used them and restructured them to show off their own skills.

641
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:51,200
Director Heo Kwan Yeong, you previously worked at Ginger, right?

642
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:54,740
You probably know internal issues better than anyone.

643
00:47:54,740 --> 00:47:58,060
 Look at this. She's jabbing me. 

644
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:01,640
 I'm home! 

645
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:05,410
Why is it so dark? Did they go somewhere?

646
00:48:14,010 --> 00:48:15,820
Hi.

647
00:48:15,820 --> 00:48:18,390
Oh, you were home, Honey.

648
00:48:19,460 --> 00:48:21,440
Well, I...

649
00:48:27,910 --> 00:48:33,710
I'm currently...well... um...um...

650
00:48:49,270 --> 00:48:52,410
You've been out of town for a while.

651
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:03,250
To spend some time together, just the two of us,

652
00:49:03,250 --> 00:49:05,950
I sent our daughters out.

653
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:09,550
For the whole week.

654
00:49:09,550 --> 00:49:11,690
The wh-whole week?

655
00:49:11,690 --> 00:49:15,680
The whole week...

656
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:24,060
It's okay.

657
00:49:27,430 --> 00:49:29,710
Oh my, my, my.

658
00:49:38,130 --> 00:49:40,810
 Mom took care of it. 

659
00:50:01,660 --> 00:50:03,890
 Contact me after you think about it. 

660
00:50:03,890 --> 00:50:07,260
 But...you shouldn't take too long. 

661
00:50:07,260 --> 00:50:13,540
 Sometimes in life, the timing of a decision is more crucial than the decision itself. 

662
00:50:29,470 --> 00:50:31,450
What is this? You woke up early.

663
00:50:31,450 --> 00:50:33,830
Yes. I like running in the morning.

664
00:50:33,830 --> 00:50:36,220
Really?

665
00:50:36,220 --> 00:50:38,210
Do you want to make a bet?

666
00:50:38,210 --> 00:50:42,850
Well, the loser pays for the coffee.

667
00:50:53,910 --> 00:50:56,710
♫  Today is calm in the middle  ♫

668
00:50:56,710 --> 00:50:59,720
They're overflowing with energy.

669
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:03,650
♫  Singing songs of our own.  ♫

670
00:51:05,470 --> 00:51:08,150
♫  I will take your hands and won't let go  ♫

671
00:51:08,150 --> 00:51:10,960
♫  No need to say the words 'cause you know  ♫

672
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:14,660
♫  You know, you know, I know, I know  ♫

673
00:51:15,660 --> 00:51:20,550
♫  I need you to warm this lonely heart tonight  ♫

674
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:27,550
♫  Baby, that's way I'll live the other day of my own  ♫

675
00:51:27,550 --> 00:51:30,510
♫  Telling you to say to her  ♫

676
00:51:30,510 --> 00:51:34,400
♫  Just call me baby, like you used to do  ♫

677
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:39,430
♫  I will always be with you, my love  ♫

678
00:51:39,430 --> 00:51:41,590
You run better than I thought.

679
00:51:41,590 --> 00:51:43,320
You thought?

680
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:45,370
I'm still a man.

681
00:51:47,670 --> 00:51:49,630
"I'm still..."

682
00:51:49,630 --> 00:51:50,970
He's so funny.

683
00:51:50,970 --> 00:51:55,590
I'm still a former athlete, so I naturally thought I'd win.

684
00:51:55,590 --> 00:51:57,170
I won, right?

685
00:51:57,170 --> 00:51:59,880
Since you cheated, On Ma Eum.

686
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:01,930
Cheated?

687
00:52:01,930 --> 00:52:03,000
Sure.

688
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:06,130
Whatever.

689
00:52:06,130 --> 00:52:08,230
It's my treat.

690
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:13,000
I'll pay.

691
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,040
Let's go.

692
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:16,750
♫  I"ll take your hand that won't let go  ♫

693
00:52:16,750 --> 00:52:19,560
♫  No need to say a word, 'cause you know  ♫

694
00:52:19,560 --> 00:52:23,490
♫  We know, we know, I know, I know  ♫

695
00:52:24,430 --> 00:52:29,680
♫  I need you on this lonely, hard tonight  ♫

696
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:31,920
Thank you.

697
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:36,100
♫  That's the only way I'll leave the altar to be on my own  ♫

698

00:52:39,100 --> 00:52:42,140
♫  Call me baby, like the way you used to do  ♫

700
00:52:42,140 --> 00:52:43,210
It's cold.

701
00:52:43,210 --> 00:52:47,820
♫  I'll always be with you, my love  ♫

702
00:52:47,820 --> 00:52:51,980
♫  Darling, I will save your day and let you know  ♫

703
00:52:51,980 --> 00:52:57,910
Ma Eum, you look like someone I know.

704
00:52:57,910 --> 00:53:00,090
Who?

705
00:53:00,090 --> 00:53:03,920
There is someone...

706
00:53:22,390 --> 00:53:24,310
Excuse me, PD.

707
00:53:26,740 --> 00:53:30,390
Can you take a look at my current work?

708
00:53:30,390 --> 00:53:31,890
Me?

709
00:53:31,890 --> 00:53:33,310
Yes.

710
00:53:36,470 --> 00:53:42,920
I finished coloring like this, but I'm not sure how to pitch the story.

711
00:53:44,380 --> 00:53:46,260
It's a story about baseball.

712
00:53:46,260 --> 00:53:50,100
Yes, I was in the Little League up to seventh grade.

713
00:53:50,100 --> 00:53:54,640
What if I didn't give up and continued playing baseball?

714
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:57,470
That's what I imagined while drawing this webtoon.

715
00:53:57,470 --> 00:53:59,590
Editor-in-Chief will like this.

716
00:53:59,590 --> 00:54:00,450
Excuse me?

717
00:54:00,450 --> 00:54:04,290
Our Editor-in-Chief is a baseball superfan.

718
00:54:04,290 --> 00:54:08,260
It would be good to appeal to that aspect when you pitch the story tomorrow.

719
00:54:08,260 --> 00:54:09,780
Since you used to be a baseball player,

720
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:12,610
you have a vast knowledge and experience in baseball and

721
00:54:12,610 --> 00:54:14,950
that you're confident about putting that into the story.

722
00:54:14,950 --> 00:54:16,490
Thank you so much.

723
00:54:16,490 --> 00:54:20,040
I think I have a sense of how I'm going to pitch the story.

724
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:22,950
Was I of any help?

725
00:54:22,950 --> 00:54:24,560
Enormously.

726
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:27,380
As expected, a PD is different.

727
00:54:28,010 --> 00:54:29,900
I'm glad.

728
00:54:37,710 --> 00:54:40,670
- You want something to drink?
 - Yes, give me one, please.

729
00:54:43,660 --> 00:54:45,170
You are pitching with this?

730
00:54:45,170 --> 00:54:47,530
- Hey, hey. Come here and look at this.
 - Yes, yes.

731
00:54:47,530 --> 00:54:49,000
This is amazing, really.

732
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,510
Wow, what is this?

733
00:54:51,510 --> 00:54:55,360
Aigoo, I beat one person.

734
00:54:56,770 --> 00:54:59,540
How did he get into the camp?

735
00:54:59,540 --> 00:55:03,380
Does he have money or connections?

736
00:55:03,380 --> 00:55:05,410
Is that a drawing or doodling?

737
00:55:05,410 --> 00:55:07,710
Is he really a cartoon artist?

738
00:55:07,710 --> 00:55:10,250
He just drew that by hand like chicken scratch.

739
00:55:10,250 --> 00:55:12,900
Isn't that doodling?

740
00:55:13,810 --> 00:55:15,390
Hey...

741
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:04,630
One minute left until the finish.

742
00:56:04,630 --> 00:56:07,430
Please submit your manuscripts.

743
00:56:16,360 --> 00:56:19,570
 Send 

744
00:56:19,570 --> 00:56:22,580
 Email sent 

745
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:27,380
I'll start the countdown.

746
00:56:27,380 --> 00:56:30,680
Eight, seven, six,

747
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:34,180
five, four, three,

748
00:56:34,180 --> 00:56:36,040
two, one.

749
00:56:36,040 --> 00:56:37,490
It's over.

750
00:56:37,490 --> 00:56:39,640
Good work, everyone!

751
00:56:42,300 --> 00:56:44,200
We did it!

752
00:56:46,790 --> 00:56:48,880
You did great!

753
00:56:49,780 --> 00:56:51,370
- Great job.
 - Good work.

754
00:56:51,370 --> 00:56:53,420
It's over now.

755
00:56:56,010 --> 00:57:00,490
Hi everyone, I drew the webtoon "Vampire Family Goes to Seoul."

756
00:57:00,490 --> 00:57:02,990
I'm Gu Seul Ah.

757
00:57:02,990 --> 00:57:07,130
First of all, the genre of this cartoon is fantasy romance.

758
00:57:07,130 --> 00:57:09,070
The overall storyline

759
00:57:09,070 --> 00:57:13,600
is about a vampire family who moved from the countryside to Seoul as they begin adapting to city life

760
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:19,900
and two main characters' sweet yet brutal romance.

761
00:57:23,490 --> 00:57:27,980
Kang Tae Gyu, you were accepted to the Papaya audition.

762
00:57:27,980 --> 00:57:29,860
Yes, when I was 20 years old.

763
00:57:29,860 --> 00:57:32,430
I thought I'd make my debut and become successful then

764
00:57:32,430 --> 00:57:36,230
but for years, they only assigned me to revise characters and content.

765
00:57:36,230 --> 00:57:41,580
All I did was work under PDs who had poor taste and wasted time.

766
00:57:41,580 --> 00:57:44,530
 Mom! Watch your back! 

767
00:57:44,530 --> 00:57:48,450
I don't look at other cartoons because I get mad.

768
00:57:48,450 --> 00:57:53,730
There are some weird cartoons at Neon.

769
00:57:53,730 --> 00:57:58,180
Makes me wonder why my work doesn't get noticed.

770
00:57:58,180 --> 00:58:00,300
From other people's cartoons,

771
00:58:00,300 --> 00:58:03,760
if you can't find strengths, then you will never improve.

772
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:06,280
Looking at others' work is also a part of learning.

773
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:09,430
Your narrow-mindedness disappoints me.

774
00:58:11,340 --> 00:58:15,350
Hello, my name is Lee Yu Jin, who worked on "Full Count."

775
00:58:17,390 --> 00:58:18,830
 Two out. Full count. 

776
00:58:18,830 --> 00:58:23,450
Everyone, do you know what "full count" means?

777
00:58:23,450 --> 00:58:25,870
Two strikes and three balls.

778
00:58:25,870 --> 00:58:28,510
That's called a full count.

779
00:58:28,510 --> 00:58:33,060
This is where you may see homeruns or three outs.

780
00:58:33,060 --> 00:58:35,590
Just like that moment of concentration,

781
00:58:35,590 --> 00:58:40,150
I also put my fervent desire into this as I worked on my webtoon.

782
00:58:40,150 --> 00:58:41,310
Thank you.

783
00:58:41,310 --> 00:58:43,890
Lee Yu Jin. You were in the Little League.

784
00:58:43,890 --> 00:58:47,470
Right, I played with male students until middle school.

785
00:58:47,470 --> 00:58:50,440
But I quit because of the physical differences.

786
00:58:50,440 --> 00:58:51,410
Pitcher or fielder?

787
00:58:51,410 --> 00:58:54,840
I did both, but I'm more confident as a pitcher.

788
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:56,440
I throw curve balls really well.

789
00:58:56,440 --> 00:59:00,350
Wow! A curve ball... Lee Yu Jin...

790
00:59:00,350 --> 00:59:03,950
Then you must have plenty to write about in your episodes.

791
00:59:03,950 --> 00:59:06,210
Yes, I'm confident in that sense.

792
00:59:06,210 --> 00:59:09,400
I also have many friends with stories.

793
00:59:16,610 --> 00:59:18,360
 Kim Pal, in his 50s, National Religion, Sect Leader 

794
00:59:18,360 --> 00:59:19,910
Yes.

795
00:59:25,860 --> 00:59:27,520
So...

796
00:59:29,050 --> 00:59:30,910
Peeve is...

797
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:35,300
a human's potential power

798
00:59:36,340 --> 00:59:38,500
It's a...

799
00:59:39,590 --> 00:59:43,110
conceptual weapon that controls human potential.

800
00:59:43,110 --> 00:59:47,510
Out of fear created by humans

801
00:59:47,510 --> 00:59:51,040
or out of hatred...

802
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:53,740
they're monsters...

803
00:59:54,830 --> 00:59:57,050
So... well...

804
00:59:57,050 --> 01:00:00,020
the people fighting against beings...

805
01:00:00,020 --> 01:00:03,050
that are like religious sect leaders.

806
01:00:03,050 --> 01:00:05,980
That's the story of this comic.

807
01:00:05,980 --> 01:00:08,440
Where did you learn to create cartoons?

808
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:10,560
Did you take classes somewhere?

809
01:00:10,560 --> 01:00:13,440
No, I just started drawing on my own.

810
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:15,210
No wonder.

811
01:00:19,560 --> 01:00:21,850
The story is interesting, but...

812
01:00:21,850 --> 01:00:26,630
Are you interested in becoming just a story writer?

813
01:00:26,630 --> 01:00:29,770
Cartoon requires drawings to persuade, but

814
01:00:29,770 --> 01:00:33,640
I don't think these drawings can persuade any readers.

815
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:37,340
But...

816
01:00:37,340 --> 01:00:40,430
this is not something that I thought of as writing at first.

817
01:00:40,430 --> 01:00:43,670
It came to my mind as images, so that's why I started drawing cartoons.

818
01:00:43,670 --> 01:00:45,380
Yes. Okay, okay.

819
01:00:45,380 --> 01:00:46,890
Listening to how you talk,

820
01:00:46,890 --> 01:00:49,850
I think it will be too much for you to write it out as well.

821
01:00:54,700 --> 01:00:58,670
Sin Dae Ryuk, have you ever thought about learning how to draw?

822
01:00:58,670 --> 01:01:01,360
- Not even once? 
- That's right.

823
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:07,790
My desire is not to draw well, but to draw cartoons.

824
01:01:07,790 --> 01:01:09,650
What kind of argument is that?

825
01:01:09,650 --> 01:01:12,800
Can you separate cartoons and drawings?

826
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:14,390
Huh?

827
01:01:52,570 --> 01:01:54,300
I'm so sorry.

828
01:01:54,300 --> 01:01:56,130
It's broken.

829
01:01:56,130 --> 01:02:00,060
But you are not going to draw cartoons anyway, right?

830
01:02:00,060 --> 01:02:03,220
I thought it'd be better if you quit now.

831
01:02:03,220 --> 01:02:06,530
We've been in this field for a long time.

832
01:02:06,530 --> 01:02:09,280
We can pretty much see how it goes.

833
01:02:10,810 --> 01:02:12,220
What is it that you want to say?

834
01:02:12,220 --> 01:02:14,870
Well, must we spell it out?

835
01:02:14,870 --> 01:02:18,120
We're saying this for your sake.

836
01:02:18,120 --> 01:02:21,410
No matter how well you draw with this trash,

837
01:02:21,410 --> 01:02:23,730
you can't make your debut.

838
01:02:31,120 --> 01:02:34,890
Rather than people who are overrated like a fossil in standing water,

839
01:02:34,890 --> 01:02:37,700
I think I'll make my debut first.

840
01:02:38,710 --> 01:02:40,770
What?

841
01:02:40,770 --> 01:02:42,440
What an unbelievable bastard.

842
01:02:42,440 --> 01:02:44,530
A**hole, you want to die?

843
01:02:44,530 --> 01:02:46,550
How old are you, a**!

844
01:02:46,550 --> 01:02:48,250
You bastard, how dare you...

845
01:02:48,250 --> 01:02:50,290
So arrogant!

846
01:02:53,380 --> 01:02:57,110
What the f*** do you think you're doing?

847
01:02:59,390 --> 01:03:01,350
You, seriously!

848
01:03:05,570 --> 01:03:09,510
Whatever you guys mouth off, I'll never give up drawing comics.

849
01:03:09,510 --> 01:03:12,830
Your minds are rotten anyway.

850
01:03:12,830 --> 01:03:16,070
You guys haven't made it yet because that's all you see.

851
01:03:16,070 --> 01:03:18,570
Crazy bastard!

852
01:03:19,860 --> 01:03:21,850
Please stop.

853
01:03:22,550 --> 01:03:24,460
Unless you want to get kicked out of the camp.

854
01:03:24,460 --> 01:03:26,140
Who the hell are you?

855
01:03:26,140 --> 01:03:29,070
It's all a done deal. I can't get kicked out anyway!

856
01:03:38,630 --> 01:03:41,460
What are you doing right now?

857
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:21,310


858
01:04:27,030 --> 01:04:30,380
♫  There isn't anything which can force me  ♫

859
01:04:30,380 --> 01:04:33,190
♫  Don't comfort me that way  ♫

860
01:04:33,190 --> 01:04:38,060
 Today's Webtoon 
 ♫  The crisis faces me now and I feel like everthing will crash  ♫ 

861
01:04:38,060 --> 01:04:40,590
 If you speak bad thoughts, then things will turn out like that. 

862
01:04:40,590 --> 01:04:44,100
 It's like being cursed by the things you said. 

863
01:04:44,100 --> 01:04:47,200
 Create an incubating team with new artists. 

864
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:50,830
 He knows how to direct cartoons innately. 

865
01:04:50,830 --> 01:04:53,210
 What if keeping the current Webtoon Service Team is profitable long term? 

866
01:04:53,210 --> 01:04:55,680
 Then, what would happen? 

867
01:04:55,680 --> 01:04:58,720
 Is webtoon being removed from the homepage? 

868
01:04:58,720 --> 01:05:01,190
 What would be the right move for me? 

869
01:05:01,190 --> 01:05:03,420
 Grow as much as you can 

870
01:05:03,420 --> 01:05:06,000
 so that you can be very useful. 

871
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:09,560
♫  There isn't anything which can force me  ♫

872
01:05:09,560 --> 01:05:13,890
♫  Don't comfort me that way  ♫
