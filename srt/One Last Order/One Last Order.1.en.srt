1
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,500
KyungSoo! The counter!

2
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:35,060
Oh, sure!

3
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:39,880
Hello, what can I get you?

4
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:43,120
One hot Americano, please.

5
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,120
Sure, that's 4,500 won.

6
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:47,180
Here.

7
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,420
Do you need the receipt?

8
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:52,380
That's okay.

9
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:54,040
Thank you.

10
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:11,240
Here's your Americano~.

11
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:13,420
Thank you!

12
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,280
There's nothing today...

13
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,260
Too hot!

14
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:20,060
"Smile by Young Hye Won."

15
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:27,120
"The most beautiful,
most heartwarming,

16
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:28,480
Most comfortable,

17
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:32,640
The most loving shape
that humans can make.

18
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,060
The smiling you, The gazing me.

19
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:39,060
We're both happy.

20
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:21,060
Who could it be?

21
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:31,820
Is it her?

22
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:37,480
No...
I don't think she likes to read.

23
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,480
But she is always smiling.

24
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,720
There's him also.

25
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:50,060
I think I've seen him reading...

26
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:54,120
But I don't remember
if it was a manghwa or a magazine

27
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,460
I'm going crazy...

28
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,880
"Things I know
about the secret admirer."

29
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:31,820
"Likes to read and write."

30
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:37,280
"Is a little introverted
but seems to be kind."

31
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:41,900
"Likes ballad songs about love."

32
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,860
"Likes poems about the beach..."

33
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:52,100
"Likes the beach."

34
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,200
Why are you late again?!

35
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,300
I'm sorry,
I will come earlier next time!

36
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,120
Go change already!

37
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:19,660
Sure thing!

38
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:26,960
"Is a little introverted but kind."

39
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,380
Could it be her?

40
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:53,720
This is good~

41
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,260
I don't like that song.

42
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,620
What? No...

43
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:01,140
No, no! I hate that too~.

44
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:03,140
What about this one?

45
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:13,960
"Likes ballad songs about love."

46
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:35,860
I will be here,
so why don't you rest a little?

47
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:38,540
Ok, I'll rest for 10 minutes.

48
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:59,920
"Likes to read and write."

49
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:04,480
"Poems about the beach..."

50
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:23,200
Excuse me,
I have something to ask...

51
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:26,200
If you want to order something,
the counter...

52
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,020
Oh, that's not it!

53
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:32,740
I have this assignment where
I have to conduct a survey...

54
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,460
Oh, sure...

55
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,260
It's really quick!

56
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,720
If you're going to travel
on the weekend.

57
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:45,620
Would you rather go
to the countryside or to the beach?

58
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:49,740
But... What kind of survey is this?

59
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,560
That's... For school...

60
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,780
Are you hitting on me?

61
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,580
No, no... That's not...

62
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:04,580
I'm sorry but...

63
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:07,660
I'm not interested in dating right now.

64
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,840
Excuse me~ Are you alright?

65
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,220
Yes...?

66
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:52,140
I saw you two talking and now
you have this look on your face...

67
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:54,580
Oh, that's nothing!

68
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:56,880
I was just doing an assignment...

69
00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:00,940
I was also rejected in the past
but it gets better!

70
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:02,340
Yeah...

71
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,280
Don't worry about it!

72
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,820
Somebody who truly likes you will appear~.

73
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:09,060
Cheer up!

74
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,960
"Kind personality."

75
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:41,800
It's so cold!
I hate the winter!

76
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:45,160
It's cold but isn't the snow beautiful?

77
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:46,440
Nope...

78
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:49,100
Rather than that,
the sun shining is better!

79
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,520
Going to the beach in the summer...

80
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,940
I wanna go to the beach!

81
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:59,320
"Likes poems about the beach"

82
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,320
I like the beach too but...

83
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,980
Isn't it good in the winter too?

84
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:08,780
Looking at the seagulls flying around
gives me this feeling...

85
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:11,660
Should I say freedom?

86
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,520
Can you stop saying these cheesy things?!

87
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,620
Okay...

88
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:35,360
Reading again?
Don't you get tired of it?

89
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:40,380
It's such a pity that you don't understand
the joy of reading.

90
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:44,640
Pity about what?
It's not my hobbie or anything.

91
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,940
"Likes to read and write"

92
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,360
I'm reading and you're annoying.

93
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,360
Why don't you go play with Kyungsoo?

94
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:56,540
He's acting like a child in love
for the first time.

95
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:00,020
Could it be that you're his first love?

96
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,820
Is it because I'm so pretty?

97
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:07,120
Actually he is prettier but...

98
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,000
Agreed!

99
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,060
Let me do it for you~.

100
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,380
Thank you.

101
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,700
Excuse me! Sir?

102
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,200
Yes?

103
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,240
Aren't you forgetting these?

104
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,340
You can throw that away.

105
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:03,920
Really?
It looks really important...

106
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:06,280
It was before but...

107
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,960
I think I misunderstood everything.

108
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,960
I don't need that anymore.

109
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:12,700
Don't give up!

110
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:18,100
The person who wrote these
for you didn't give up.

111
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:20,100
So you shouldn't do it either!

112
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,660
Do you know who wrote them?

113
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:25,360
Did you write them?!

114
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:31,300
It wasn't me but...
It's someone you already know.

115
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,900
Just think about it a little!

116
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,140
Am I stupid?

117
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,540
Can I ask you for a favor?

118
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:21,520
What is it?

119
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,060
Can you deliver this to that person?

120
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,180
Sure!

121
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:37,280
Thank you!

122
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:55,820
We have an appointment
so we'll leave first!

123
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:56,900
You're going together?

124
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:58,800
Tonight's girls night out~.

125
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:01,780
Can you finish it by yourself?

126
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:03,640
Of course, just go~ Have fun!

127
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,140
See you next week!

128
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,240
Sorry, we're already closed~.

129
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:28,300
Excuse me...

130
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:38,060
Can I make one last order?
