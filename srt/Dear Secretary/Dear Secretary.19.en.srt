1
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,280
What do you think? Pretty handsome, right?

2
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:18,519
Because he's too outstanding,

3
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,280
he was recommended by HR again.

4
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,280
And again, it's President Qin's personal pick.

5
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,280
It seems

6
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,640
Secretary Lin's competition has finally appeared.

7
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:29,000
Competition?

8
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,000
What does that count for?

9
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:12,879
President Qin,

10
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,400
Here, take a look.

11
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:17,439
Look at this.

12
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:20,719
Do you understand?

13
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:22,319
You need to compare it with last month's hit product.

14
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:23,039
Understood.

15
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:24,919
So it needs to include these.

16
00:02:26,439 --> 00:02:27,439
Now look at this.

17
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:30,759
All data needs to be subtotaled by category.

18
00:02:30,759 --> 00:02:31,520
What's going on?

19
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:34,000
Bring it to me when you're done.

20
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,240
Do you understand now?

21
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,439
See?

22
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:37,680
Okay.

23
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:42,280
Crisis.

24
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,520
Crisis? What crisis?

25
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,800
Secretary Lin.

26
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:50,560
President Qin.

27
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,719
She asked me to request from you

28
00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:53,159
her recent schedule.

29
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,800
His eyes are somewhat big,

30
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,599
but they can't compare to my sword-like brows and starry eyes.

31
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:05,919
His nose bridge is high,

32
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,599
but it's just average.

33
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,199
Nothing like my nose, as straight as a mountain peak,

34
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:11,439
giving a sense of firmness.

35
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,520
And thin lips.

36
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,479
They may seem sexy,

37
00:03:13,479 --> 00:03:15,520
but are far less defined than the strong lines of my lips.

38
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,680
A well-defined face

39
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,120
is only good at first glance.

40
00:03:19,159 --> 00:03:20,159
It can't compare to my

41
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,719
features, as if meticulously carved by a master,

42
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,840
with every line perfectly in place.

43
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,479
In short, in terms of looks,

44
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:27,960
I completely crush him.

45
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,039
Secretary Lin?

46
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,360
Sorry,

47
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:33,000
President Qin asked me to request

48
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,080
the schedule from you.

49
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,240
His personality is just simply cheerful and outgoing.

50
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,800
Not as decisive and resolute as mine.

51
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,520
A young person being overly enthusiastic

52
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,599
only comes off as flighty.

53
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,680
While my steadiness

54
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,800
is the key to victory.

55
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,400
Patience is fine,

56
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:46,719
but you can't judge a book by its cover.

57
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:48,080
Who knows what's beneath that patience?

58
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,520
Could be harboring ill intentions.

59
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,360
Seems in terms of personality,

60
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,520
I also win completely.

61
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,599
Secretary Lin.

62
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:56,240
Secretary Lin!

63
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:00,840
Okay.

64
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,960
I'll send it to your email later.

65
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:04,520
Thank you.

66
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,120
Nice to meet you.

67
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,919
For President Qin's work in the future,

68
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:09,520
please feel free to assign it to me.

69
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,280
I'm happy to learn from you.

70
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:33,879
It's not just a crisis anymore.

71
00:04:33,879 --> 00:04:36,319
It's precarious.

72
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:46,240
Secretary Lin,

73
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,720
do you have a moment now?

74
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,160
I still need to ask you

75
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:51,759
about how President Qin likes her coffee.

76
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,160
Alright.

77
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,519
Here.

78
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,319
Secretary Lin,

79
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,000
President Qin's taste

80
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:17,120
is this strong?

81
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,120
Yes.

82
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:19,480
So I'll trouble you

83
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:20,600
to grind more beans.

84
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,519
I see.

85
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,319
Thanks.

86
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:33,160
President Qin,

87
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:34,199
your coffee.

88
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:42,560
How is it?

89
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:51,839
Good.

90
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,399
She didn't even get angry?

91
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:58,079
We were worried about President Qin,

92
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,839
now we should worry about Secretary Lin.

93
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:00,959
Yeah.

94
00:06:01,079 --> 00:06:03,000
After all, a secretary can be replaced anytime.

95
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,600
So you need a few backups.

96
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,160
Should we hold the Strategy Meeting?

97
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:14,759
Not yet.

98
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:16,000
Okay, no rush.

99
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,199
If you put it that way,

100
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:19,920
bro,

101
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,319
you're in a precarious spot.

102
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:23,759
What do you mean?

103
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:25,480
Look at you.

104
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:28,040
Your physique: 90 points.

105
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,839
Looks: 90 points.

106
00:06:29,959 --> 00:06:30,920
Charm: 90 points.

107
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,000
Ability: 90 points.

108
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,360
As for personality,

109
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,040
90 points.

110
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,800
So in every aspect,

111
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,519
you're already top-tier.

112
00:06:41,079 --> 00:06:42,399
A 90-point man.

113
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:43,839
You...

114
00:06:43,959 --> 00:06:44,800
Of course.

115
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:47,800
90 points?

116
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,639
It's 100 points.

117
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,279
That's not right.

118
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:53,120
You need to leave yourself some

119
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,560
room for improvement.

120
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,439
And then?

121
00:06:58,399 --> 00:06:59,879
As for this Li Yi,

122
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,439
let me assess him.

123
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,199
Looks: 90 points.

124
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:08,160
Physique: 90 points.

125
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,079
Ability: 90 points.

126
00:07:09,079 --> 00:07:10,199
Charm: 90 points.

127
00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:12,079
His personality must be 90 points too.

128
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:13,879
Just like you, a 90-point man.

129
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,319
He deserves that?

130
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:18,439
Why wouldn't he?

131
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:20,639
You can't treat someone like an extra

132
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,240
just because they have fewer scenes.

133
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,079
A supporting character

134
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,040
is still a person.

135
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,439
Then go on.

136
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,399
No personal bias.

137
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:34,360
He has one very important bonus point

138
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,079
that you don't have.

139
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:37,199
What is it?

140
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:38,959
It's...

141
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,879
Novelty.

142
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:42,879
Fresh.

143
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,360
Fresh meat. Fresh.

144
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:45,519
You don't have it.

145
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:51,079
Hey, boss.

146
00:07:55,399 --> 00:07:56,480
I understand.

147
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,160
Are you angry?

148
00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:08,000
Being petty, huh?

149
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:10,759
You're a 95.

150
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:12,959
120.

151
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:14,360
Can't go any higher.

152
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:15,680
A 120-point man.

153
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:16,240
The most impressive.

154
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,759
Because it was a last-minute decision

155
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:21,879
to go on a business trip overseas,

156
00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:23,639
so

157
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:24,720
I had to find someone

158
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,279
without a language barrier.

159
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:29,240
Isn't it because I saw you've been working too hard lately?

160
00:08:29,399 --> 00:08:30,800
I wanted you to rest a few more days.

161
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,080
And he's not tired?

162
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,159
Who?

163
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,320
That flashy but useless Secretary Li.

164
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,000
Oh, you mean Secretary Li?

165
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,919
He's new.

166
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,600
But...

167
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,559
Did I dial the wrong number?

168
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:47,799
Is this still the same

169
00:08:47,799 --> 00:08:49,399
Secretary Lin who rarely even raises his voice?

170
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:49,919
Open the door.

171
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,480
What?

172
00:08:51,639 --> 00:08:52,440
Open the door, now.

173
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,759
Secretary Lin, how did you...

174
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,120
Is my name Secretary Lin?

175
00:09:08,679 --> 00:09:10,080
Do I just go by Secretary Lin?

176
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,519
To you, am I just like all the other Secretaries Zhao,

177
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:12,679
Secretaries Zhang, and Secretaries Li?

178
00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:13,759
Don't I have my own name?

179
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,639
To make sure you don't forget,

180
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:16,840
I have to remind you.

181
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:18,240
I am your boyfriend.

182
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,080
One and only.

183
00:09:20,679 --> 00:09:22,200
You are my boyfriend.

184
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,399
But...

185
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:24,039
What?

186
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:25,360
Need some novelty now?

187
00:09:25,879 --> 00:09:27,679
So you're looking for a younger secretary?

188
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:28,960
Does a fish that just took the bait

189
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,159
no longer need to be fed?

190
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:36,120
Do I look ridiculous?

191
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:38,559
What are you laughing at?

192
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,519
Stop laughing.

193
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:42,039
I never thought

194
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:44,080
the always so polite Secretary Lin

195
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:45,960
could be so scary when jealous.

196
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:47,799
Are you teasing me?

197
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:51,519
Are you that

198
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:53,320
lacking in confidence?

199
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:58,679
My dear Secretary Lin.

200
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:03,799
Let go of me.

201
00:10:03,799 --> 00:10:04,679
Let me go.

202
00:10:04,679 --> 00:10:06,320
My shoe came off.

203
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,200
You're really angry.

204
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:21,799
Is this better?

205
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,039
How about this?

206
00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:32,559
Then...

207
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:36,200
Is this better now?
