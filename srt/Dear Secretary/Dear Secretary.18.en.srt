1
00:01:15,319 --> 00:01:16,480
Mom

2
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,719
What are you doing here?

3
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,040
I came to see you.

4
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,920
How long has it been since you came home?

5
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,680
Where have you been so late at night?

6
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:25,760
Coming back this late.

7
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:27,280
I should have known better than to...

8
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,680
...let you move out on your own.

9
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:30,959
Secretary Lin and I...

10
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:32,280
...just got back from working overtime.

11
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:34,200
He's seeing me home, isn't he?

12
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:34,560
Yes.

13
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,719
The company's new product launch has been keeping us very busy.

14
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:38,040
Mom, you...

15
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,480
...have seen me now.

16
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,719
Maybe you should head out first.

17
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:42,719
Leave? What for?

18
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:43,840
I finally made it here.

19
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:45,120
Mom.

20
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:45,959
It's getting late.

21
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:46,799
Dad will be worried.

22
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:48,040
You should get some rest, okay?

23
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:48,840
I'll see you out.

24
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:49,319
No, I mean...

25
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:50,000
I'll call a car for you.

26
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:50,239
Let's go.

27
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:51,239
I just got here.

28
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:51,680
Let's go, let's go.

29
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:52,920
Wait, wait, wait.

30
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,120
Why isn't Secretary Lin leaving?

31
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,599
The two of us...

32
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:00,840
...still have some things to go over.

33
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,799
So...

34
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:02,840
Mom, how about...

35
00:02:04,519 --> 00:02:05,719
I call you a car?

36
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:07,760
Don't rush me.

37
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:09,479
I haven't even gotten to the main point.

38
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:10,639
Sit down, sit down, quickly.

39
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,639
What can't wait until tomorrow?

40
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:13,560
Listen to me.

41
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,919
There's a very important matter.

42
00:02:15,479 --> 00:02:16,680
I'm telling you.

43
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:18,520
Next week...

44
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,599
...I've arranged for you...

45
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:20,919
...twelve blind dates.

46
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:22,719
Blind dates?

47
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:25,479
Yes.

48
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:26,919
What are the specifics?

49
00:02:26,919 --> 00:02:27,840
It's like this.

50
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,840
Monday, ten AM.

51
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,439
Height: 188 cm.

52
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:32,400
A P.E. teacher.

53
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,719
Hobby: fitness.

54
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,560
Six-pack abs.

55
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,360
Monday, two PM.

56
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,439
A partner lawyer at a top-tier law firm.

57
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,759
Hobby: music.

58
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:43,120
Piano grade eight.

59
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:46,000
Thursday, eleven PM.

60
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,560
A software engineer.

61
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:48,520
This guy...

62
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,879
...is a bit light on hair.

63
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:51,360
But he's highly intelligent!

64
00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:53,919
We have to think about the next generation's IQ.

65
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,120
Friday, three AM.

66
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,400
What time?

67
00:02:58,759 --> 00:03:00,120
Three in the morning.

68
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,759
A blind date at three in the morning?

69
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:03,199
Mom.

70
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,520
Are you okay?

71
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,199
He's a doctor in the ICU.

72
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:08,000
His work is extremely busy.

73
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,520
I had a hard time getting this slot.

74
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,759
Listen to me.

75
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:12,879
This time, you better perk up.

76
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:13,879
Do you hear me?

77
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:15,840
Before you turn thirty...

78
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,960
...I must get you a boyfriend.

79
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:19,319
You're not worried at all.

80
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:21,039
Your dad and I are worried sick.

81
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,199
Trust in Mom's rigorous selection.

82
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,039
There's bound to be one that suits you.

83
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,439
Secretary Lin, take this.

84
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:31,080
You're in charge of supervising her then.

85
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:35,520
Mom.

86
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:35,919
Um...

87
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:36,680
Auntie.

88
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,520
Actually...

89
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:40,599
Meili and I...

90
00:03:40,599 --> 00:03:41,800
...are already together.

91
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:43,759
Together doing what?

92
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,840
We're together.

93
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,960
Together doing what, exactly?

94
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,280
It means the two of us...

95
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,840
...are together.

96
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:53,800
Yes.

97
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,800
You learned this from TV, didn't you?

98
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,520
Hiring Secretary Lin at a high salary...

99
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,120
...to play your boyfriend.

100
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,000
Who are you trying to fool here?

101
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,479
We really are together.

102
00:04:11,479 --> 00:04:11,960
I'm telling you.

103
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,280
Don't mess around with me here.

104
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:14,520
No.

105
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,400
Auntie.

106
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,639
Meili and I...

107
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:17,680
...really...

108
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,160
...are really dating.

109
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,120
I told you, we're really together.

110
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,560
Why don't you believe me?

111
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:24,079
Didn't you and Dad both hope...

112
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:25,720
...that Secretary Lin and I would get together?

113
00:04:25,879 --> 00:04:26,920
So now that we're together...

114
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,160
...shouldn't you be happy?

115
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:28,800
Why don't you believe it?

116
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,000
Why don't you believe me?

117
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:31,920
It's not that.

118
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:34,279
You...

119
00:04:34,279 --> 00:04:34,720
...you two...

120
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:37,199
...don't look like you're dating at all.

121
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:39,399
What doesn't look like it?

122
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,120
When people date...

123
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,079
...at the very least...

124
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,480
...they hold hands or something, right?

125
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:57,759
There should be a hug or something too.

126
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,839
And a kiss.

127
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:06,839
Is that enough, Mom?

128
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:08,000
What else do you want to see?

129
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,040
See what?

130
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,079
There's nothing else.

131
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,279
Mom, listen to me.

132
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,120
Go home, quickly.

133
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,399
You still haven't left.

134
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:14,240
What time is it already, Mom?

135
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,279
Don't interrupt our burning desire.

136
00:05:16,279 --> 00:05:17,040
Fiery trees and silver flowers.

137
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,199
Beautiful flowers and full moon.

138
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:18,759
Round...

139
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:20,920
...round...

140
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,240
...consummation.

141
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:23,240
Mom!

142
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:24,480
Go!

143
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,279
Go quickly!

144
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:27,920
Bye, Mom!

145
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,240
Bye-bye.

146
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,800
Meili.

147
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:41,800
Was everything you just said true?

148
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:01,000
That's way too short.

149
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,199
Yeah.

150
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:05,839
And it went by so fast.

151
00:06:08,439 --> 00:06:09,879
Why?

152
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:13,639
Two people who didn't even have a wedding when they got married...

153
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,759
...why would they have one for their remarriage?

154
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:18,600
Because this time, we want...

155
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,519
...to have Doufu with us.

156
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,160
Having Doufu is enough.

157
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,759
Why come to us?

158
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:27,759
You sure know how to pick your moment.

159
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,120
Because my darling said...

160
00:06:32,439 --> 00:06:33,399
...this matter...

161
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,160
...must be discussed with Miss Qin...

162
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,279
...in person.

163
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:37,720
So I came with her.

164
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:40,639
But, bro, I didn't know you were here.

165
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:41,639
I swear.

166
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,439
What are you talking about?

167
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,000
Isn't it better with friends around?

168
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,279
Hey, Qin Meili.

169
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:47,439
I don't care.

170
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,279
On the second day of next month...

171
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:49,480
...you must be my bridesmaid.

172
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,600
Exactly.

173
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,639
Because you two...

174
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:54,639
...are witnesses to our rekindled love.

175
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,560
We need you to witness our...

176
00:06:56,759 --> 00:06:58,240
...sacred moment.

177
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,600
I refuse.

178
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,519
I refuse too.

179
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:02,839
Hanzi.

180
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:05,120
We've been brothers for so many years.

181
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:06,920
You have to help me.

182
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,199
If you help me...

183
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,720
...next time you look for a girlfriend...

184
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:11,639
I will definitely...

185
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:14,639
Uh...

186
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:15,759
Misunderstanding!

187
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,240
That's not what I meant!

188
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,319
Forget it, I'm done.

189
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:19,319
I'm going back to sleep.

190
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:20,600
I'm dead tired.

191
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,120
Qin Meili!

192
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,160
You haven't agreed yet!

193
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,759
I'm going to sleep right now.

194
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:24,680
Sis.

195
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:33,560
What's up?

196
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:34,720
We two...

197
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:36,040
...true love.

198
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,319
Get out.

199
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:38,040
You get out too.

200
00:07:40,439 --> 00:07:40,879
Hanzi!

201
00:07:41,079 --> 00:07:41,680
Tell Meili...

202
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,399
...she must come!

203
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:42,959
You have to come too!

204
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:43,600
Hanzi!

205
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,120
What's the rush?

206
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:47,319
What's going on?

207
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:48,240
This... this...

208
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,480
Go.

209
00:07:51,399 --> 00:07:52,199
Then I'll go.

210
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:06,120
Turns out, who you are doesn't matter at all.

211
00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:08,399
Who I love is what matters most.

212
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:32,000
You're not asleep.

213
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,320
Get up and eat.

214
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:55,200
Be good.

215
00:10:55,559 --> 00:10:56,960
You have to go to the company soon.

216
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:00,080
No.

217
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:08,960
Not like this either.

218
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:13,799
How about like this?

219
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,639
Alright, alright.

220
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:22,440
Have you all heard the latest news?

221
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:24,120
What news?

222
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:25,799
President Qin is dating someone.

223
00:11:25,799 --> 00:11:27,000
Really? No way.

224
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,000
It's those two.

225
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,320
My friend ran into them.

226
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:31,559
She'd seen President Qin in reports before...

227
00:11:31,559 --> 00:11:32,919
...so she recognized him.

228
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:34,200
There's even a photo.

229
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,200
Let me show you.

230
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,000
Let's see, let's see.

231
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:38,000
Nice figure.

232
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,480
But there's no face.

233
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,279
Hey, let me see.

234
00:11:40,759 --> 00:11:43,120
Maybe the front isn't much to look at.

235
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:46,440
Our President Qin has been single since birth.

236
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,960
She won't get scammed, will she?

237
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,039
Even though she's a superwoman...

238
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:52,519
...her dating experience is basically zero.

239
00:11:52,519 --> 00:11:53,120
Right.

240
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,080
Too naive.

241
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:54,639
Yeah.

242
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,480
A woman like President Qin...

243
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,279
...the kind she'd accept...

244
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:58,879
...are definitely just toy boys after her money.

245
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,080
What do you know?

246
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:00,559
Maybe...

247
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:01,480
What kind of woman?

248
00:12:03,879 --> 00:12:04,679
Why talk behind someone's back...

249
00:12:04,679 --> 00:12:05,759
...and casually judge a girl?

250
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,120
A girl.

251
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:09,639
Saying I have no face.

252
00:12:09,639 --> 00:12:10,480
Calling me a toy boy.

253
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,480
I don't care about any of that.

254
00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:13,080
Why casually judge a...

255
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,399
...clearly outstanding girl?

256
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,600
How great are you yourselves?

257
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,559
Is your work finished?

258
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,720
You all know now.

259
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,360
Come in.

260
00:12:48,919 --> 00:12:50,039
Introduce yourself.

261
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:54,679
Hello everyone, my name is Li Yi.

262
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,279
I'm very happy to become your colleague.

263
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,279
From now on...

264
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,440
...please take good care of me.

265
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,360
Li Yi will be taking over Secretary Lin's duties.

266
00:13:01,799 --> 00:13:03,159
I hope everyone will cooperate fully.

267
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,360
He needs to get up to speed quickly...

268
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,480
...and meet my requirements.

269
00:13:06,879 --> 00:13:09,200
Especially you, Secretary Lin.

270
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:12,159
Is that clear?

271
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:14,919
Understood.
