1
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,159
Severe concussion

2
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,760
That serious?

3
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:25,959
President Qin

4
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,840
I'm here to pick up the resumes from earlier.

5
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:28,400
Secretary Xue

6
00:01:29,079 --> 00:01:29,640
What's wrong?

7
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:31,319
Yes.

8
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,599
The doctor said I need a week of rest.

9
00:01:34,519 --> 00:01:35,319
A week.

10
00:01:35,959 --> 00:01:36,959
Three days is fine too.

11
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,640
Three days.

12
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,159
Even one day is okay.

13
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:43,200
That's the minimum.

14
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,760
So I'd like to request to rest at home.

15
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:46,799
Alright.

16
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,120
I understand.

17
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,359
Ugh.

18
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:56,959
The General Manager who commanded the wind and rain three years ago...

19
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,400
Has now fallen to the point...

20
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,599
Of having to grovel...

21
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:01,079
To ask for sick leave. Pitiful, lamentable, pathetic.

22
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:05,920
Pitiful, lamentable, pathetic.

23
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,439
If I were you...

24
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,919
I'd pity myself first.

25
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,919
It's ten in the morning.

26
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:12,719
You're skipping work under the guise of a business trip.

27
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:15,000
I've already reported it to your direct supervisor.

28
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:17,759
He said he'll deal with it in ten minutes.

29
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:19,400
Which is now.

30
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:21,400
Xiao Lin, you...

31
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,719
Are you even human?

32
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:25,080
You were wandering and destitute...

33
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,000
Homeless and displaced.

34
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,039
Who took you in?

35
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:29,240
How can you kick someone when they're down?

36
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,800
I...

37
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:32,919
Move out!

38
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:33,680
Move out right now!

39
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,599
Hey, bro...

40
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,280
I'm in the elevator.

41
00:02:37,719 --> 00:02:38,520
Yeah, right.

42
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:39,520
In the elevator.

43
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,759
Be right there.

44
00:02:40,759 --> 00:02:41,360
Okay.

45
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,280
Okay.

46
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:50,840
Now I can finally rest.

47
00:03:08,759 --> 00:03:09,759
I always feel...

48
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,159
We have an unfinished story.

49
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,120
Meili.

50
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,800
Wait here for Mommy, okay?

51
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,759
Don't go anywhere.

52
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:26,800
Remember...

53
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,080
Don't go with anyone who tries to take you.

54
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:29,960
Do you hear me?

55
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,479
I'll be right back.

56
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,319
Okay.

57
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:40,680
Mommy.

58
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:42,879
Mommy.

59
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,319
Mommy.

60
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,199
Mommy.

61
00:03:48,039 --> 00:03:49,759
Mommy, where are you?

62
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:51,319
Mommy.

63
00:03:51,319 --> 00:03:52,360
Where are you?

64
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,719
Mommy.

65
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,039
Mommy.

66
00:03:59,719 --> 00:04:00,919
Mommy.

67
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,039
Mommy.

68
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:03,879
Don't cry.

69
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:05,000
This is for you.

70
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,240
Thank you.

71
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,720
You're welcome.

72
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,319
Secretary Lin isn't here.

73
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:16,279
My only motivation for coming to work is gone.

74
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:18,519
Qin Xue.

75
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:19,759
Do you know...

76
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:20,959
What's really wrong with Secretary Lin?

77
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:22,360
He's won the Perfect Attendance Award...

78
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,279
For three consecutive years.

79
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:24,439
He's never taken a day off!

80
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:27,000
I wouldn't spread rumors.

81
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,600
Unless...

82
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:34,120
Unless what?

83
00:05:40,839 --> 00:05:42,759
Tell us, tell us!

84
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,279
Listen up, everyone.

85
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,680
About President Qin...

86
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,040
President Qin.

87
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:54,759
Hello, President Qin?

88
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:56,959
What?

89
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,519
Oh, okay.

90
00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:02,199
But...

91
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:03,360
But...

92
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,160
About this matter of yours...

93
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,839
Why not just ask a lawyer?

94
00:06:10,279 --> 00:06:11,079
Yes.

95
00:06:11,399 --> 00:06:13,319
It is a little embarrassing.

96
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,439
Unlawful Entry into a Residence...

97
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:22,399
Refers to entering someone's residence without the owner's consent...

98
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:24,480
Or forcibly entering their home...

99
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,040
Or refusing to leave after being asked by the owner.

100
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,720
Refusing to leave after being asked.

101
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,639
For example, without permission...

102
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:33,279
Prying open a door or climbing over a wall, etc.

103
00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:34,959
All constitute unlawful entry.

104
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:37,000
But I didn't pry the door open.

105
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,439
It's Secretary Lin's fault for not answering his phone.

106
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:45,959
Secretary Lin.

107
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,800
Looking at it this way...

108
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,040
He really is quite handsome.

109
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,199
Why is it taking so long today?

110
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,720
This doesn't taste right.

111
00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:55,000
Because the shop you specified was closed.

112
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,480
And you wouldn't accept any other.

113
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,680
Besides, it's just plain congee.

114
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,000
So I made it myself.

115
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:03,079
If it's not from that shop, I won't eat it.

116
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:08,360
Secretary Lin.

117
00:08:08,839 --> 00:08:09,920
What happened to your hand?

118
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,240
I accidentally burned it while cooking the day before yesterday.

119
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,040
It looks pretty serious.

120
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:16,959
It's nothing.

121
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:18,120
I've already applied medicine.

122
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:20,040
I never thought Secretary Lin...

123
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,480
With that righteous gentleman's face of his...

124
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,639
Actually knows how to cook.

125
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,240
Actually, I don't.

126
00:08:24,439 --> 00:08:25,600
That's why there was an accident.

127
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:44,720
First, turn on the heat.

128
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,159
Rinse the rice.

129
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,559
Wash the rice clean.

130
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,679
Pour the rice into the pot.

131
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,480
Pour the rice into the pot.

132
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,720
Pour the rice into the pot.

133
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,039
President Qin.

134
00:09:59,039 --> 00:09:59,919
What are you...

135
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:03,639
I...

136
00:10:18,679 --> 00:10:19,799
The tofu is still here.

137
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:22,960
They said they reached an agreement...

138
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,080
To take turns raising her each month.

139
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,440
I can't believe they thought of that.

140
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,360
Thank you.

141
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,320
It's very delicious.

142
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:42,639
This doesn't taste right.

143
00:10:42,679 --> 00:10:43,879
If it's not from that place, I won't eat it.

144
00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:47,320
I'm sorry.

145
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:53,879
Although I don't know why I'm apologizing,

146
00:10:54,799 --> 00:10:57,440
but they say when you feel sorry,

147
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,519
you should say it like this.

148
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:00,200
Secretary Lin.

149
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:02,399
I want to ask you a question.

150
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,720
That day in the elevator,

151
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:07,000
why did you have such a big reaction?

152
00:11:07,879 --> 00:11:10,000
Did you think of something bad?

153
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:17,440
Secretary Lin.

154
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,159
It's nothing.

155
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,480
It was probably due to lack of sleep.

156
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,240
Just a common neurotransmitter imbalance.

157
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:37,440
Boss.

158
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,080
I'm really grateful to you today.

159
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:42,039
Secretary Lin, who hasn't slept well in three years,

160
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,639
should take this chance to rest properly.

161
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,360
I'm sorry for delaying your work.

162
00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:48,480
I apologize.

163
00:11:50,039 --> 00:11:50,840
It's fine.

164
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:53,440
Oh, right.

165
00:11:54,159 --> 00:11:55,879
I have to go meet someone soon,

166
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,320
so I won't keep you company.

167
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,519
You get some good rest.

168
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,440
Don't worry about work.

169
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:02,960
Don't go.
