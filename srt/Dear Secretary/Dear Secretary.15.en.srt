1
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,040
Please, have a seat.

2
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,280
I rented it again.

3
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:33,599
The landlord said

4
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,040
you took everything with you

5
00:01:35,319 --> 00:01:36,159
when you checked out,

6
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:37,359
and cleaned up the trash.

7
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,480
That's basic courtesy.

8
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,040
So I bought everything again.

9
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,959
To make it just like before.

10
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:46,400
Living here

11
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,319
always makes me think of

12
00:01:47,319 --> 00:01:48,519
our old days together.

13
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:53,640
Do you remember this?

14
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,640
I really liked it back then.

15
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,799
I spent a whole month's intern salary

16
00:01:58,799 --> 00:01:59,840
to buy it.

17
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,159
I gave it to you as a birthday gift.

18
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:04,760
Did you like it?

19
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,159
We were so poor then.

20
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,759
Even buying something like this

21
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:10,120
took a lot of thought.

22
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,240
But I remember

23
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,520
you were so happy back then.

24
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,000
You said,

25
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:16,879
"As long as we're together forever,

26
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,479
living an ordinary life is enough."

27
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:22,599
And this one,

28
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,639
was the first gift you gave me

29
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:26,080
after you got a job.

30
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,560
I was happy for a whole month then.

31
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,479
The first thing I did every morning

32
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:32,919
was to check if it was still there.

33
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:35,879
My time abroad was tough.

34
00:02:36,759 --> 00:02:38,159
But no matter when,

35
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:39,159
I carried it with me.

36
00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:41,319
It was like you were by my side.

37
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,560
Lin Han.

38
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,280
I gave up on you once.

39
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,439
But you also deceived me.

40
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,360
Let's just let it go,

41
00:02:50,439 --> 00:02:51,240
okay?

42
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,360
Deceived?

43
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:56,000
I already know.

44
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,159
You're from the Lin Family.

45
00:02:57,159 --> 00:02:58,240
Is that what you want to say?

46
00:02:59,159 --> 00:02:59,919
Lin Han,

47
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,039
I absolutely did not

48
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:01,960
come back because I found out

49
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,759
who you are.

50
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,560
I truly regret it.

51
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,199
I think of you every day.

52
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,199
Is who I am that important?

53
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,639
To protect my girlfriend's self-esteem,

54
00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:15,759
I bore the family pressure alone.

55
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:17,560
You call that deception?

56
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:19,759
Self-esteem?

57
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:24,080
Because once she learned the truth about my family,

58
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:27,120
she'd know she was looked down upon.

59
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,800
Wouldn't you be hurt?

60
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,000
That's why I never mentioned it.

61
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,080
Of course,

62
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:35,439
if you consider that deception,

63
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:36,639
then I have nothing more to say.

64
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:37,840
But...

65
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,360
But perhaps we could have had a better life.

66
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,280
Did we ever lack for food or clothes together?

67
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:43,319
The things you wanted,

68
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:44,599
I could have provided them.

69
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:46,000
It wasn't beyond my ability.

70
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,919
But it was outside my values.

71
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,879
So I didn't give them to you.

72
00:03:49,879 --> 00:03:51,240
And I have no regrets about that.

73
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,560
In this relationship,

74
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,280
I have not a single regret or debt.

75
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:57,680
Because I gave without reservation.

76
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,759
The reason I'm still willing to come here with you

77
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,439
is because you're more obtuse than I imagined.

78
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:05,120
Not making things clear might cause more trouble.

79
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:06,520
Really,

80
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:08,319
don't come looking for me again.

81
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,280
Because you simply don't understand me.

82
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:12,319
I don't give a second chance

83
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:14,520
to people without sincerity.

84
00:04:15,879 --> 00:04:16,519
Lin Han,

85
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,600
if you insist on ending things this disgracefully,

86
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:27,160
next time I hope to see a fresher approach.

87
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,319
Also,

88
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:30,079
help me pass a message to Lin Hai.

89
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:32,480
If he's this boring again next time,

90
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:34,120
I won't hold back anymore.

91
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:35,839
Is it because of her?

92
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:36,920
Qin Meili?

93
00:04:37,959 --> 00:04:39,480
This has nothing to do with her.

94
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,319
And what about when you were her secretary, orbiting around her?

95
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:45,959
Can you say that with a clear conscience?

96
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:47,439
With your abilities,

97
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:49,120
why would you be her secretary?

98
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,639
Dare you say that from the very start,

99
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,160
you didn't like her even a little bit?

100
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:53,600
And also,

101
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:55,399
what ridiculous self-esteem?

102
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,639
If she knew

103
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:57,480
that for these three years

104
00:04:57,639 --> 00:04:59,120
you've been hiding your identity from her,

105
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:00,519
how do you think she'd see you?

106
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,120
Have you thought about that?

107
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,199
And what about when you were her secretary, orbiting around her?

108
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,800
Can you say that with a clear conscience?

109
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,279
With your abilities,

110
00:05:26,279 --> 00:05:27,959
why would you be her secretary?

111
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,279
Is this woman out of her mind?

112
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:44,160
If she wants a divorce, fine.

113
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,279
But why is she talking to me about custody of Tofu?

114
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,959
Saying Tofu is only five,

115
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:50,600
and shouldn't be away from his mother now.

116
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,319
This... this is...

117
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:52,319
How can this be?

118
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:52,959
Right?

119
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:54,079
Hanzi.

120
00:05:54,279 --> 00:05:55,839
I'm telling you, you really shouldn't get married.

121
00:05:55,959 --> 00:05:57,720
Marriage is the grave of love,

122
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,040
and also the grave of life itself.

123
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,720
That's you guys.

124
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,519
What are you looking at?

125
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:10,160
You're watching this too?

126
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:13,160
The Qin Group is a real mess right now.

127
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,160
That girl is under a lot of pressure.

128
00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:20,120
How's the job search going?

129
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,800
Weiwei graduates next month.

130
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,079
There should still be time.

131
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:26,319
So...

132
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,240
What are your plans?

133
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:29,600
She's going abroad next year.

134
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:30,839
I'll cover the tuition.

135
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:35,199
That's not really the issue.

136
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:37,600
But going out to work for someone else...

137
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,319
Can you handle that?

138
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,680
I want to help her.

139
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,120
Who?

140
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:44,920
Weiwei?

141
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:45,959
Qin Meili.

142
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:49,920
You know her?

143
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:53,680
Hanzi.

144
00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:54,360
You...

145
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,920
Don't tell me you have feelings for her?

146
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:59,199
Even though women are an abyss...

147
00:06:59,399 --> 00:06:59,800
But...

148
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:00,839
You can't go around...

149
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:02,839
having a foot in two beds.

150
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:03,959
It's boats.

151
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:05,639
Alright, alright.

152
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:06,800
What are you talking about?

153
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,360
Boats, boats, boats.

154
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,920
I just want to help her through this tough time.

155
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:11,800
After all...

156
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,360
When I was at my most helpless,

157
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:14,759
she was the one who helped me.

158
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,360
Look into something for me.

159
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,399
Check what positions the Qin Group is hiring for.

160
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,519
No matter what it is.

161
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:21,120
I want to help her stage a comeback.

162
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,079
Can you honestly say that from the very start,

163
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:27,959
you didn't like her even a little bit?

164
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:29,959
What ridiculous self-esteem.

165
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,199
If she finds out...

166
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:31,920
that for these three years...

167
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,399
you've been hiding your identity from her...

168
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,079
How do you think she'll see you?

169
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,040
I already know.

170
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,480
That thing you've been hiding from me.

171
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,959
Do you want me to say it in front of her?

172
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:04,800
President Qin.

173
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,079
Let me propose a toast to you.

174
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:06,839
President Wang.

175
00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:07,480
I'm sorry,

176
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,800
but I'm not really in a condition to drink today.

177
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,759
On an occasion like today,

178
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:10,360
not drinking seems inappropriate, doesn't it?

179
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,240
I'll toast with tea instead.

180
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:11,800
My respects to you.

181
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,600
I...

182
00:08:13,399 --> 00:08:14,560
What's going on? You...

183
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,519
I'm so sorry, President Wang.

184
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:16,959
What are you doing?

185
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:17,800
Let me get that for you.

186
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:19,199
Alright, alright.

187
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,040
Just go back.

188
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:21,800
I'm terribly sorry.

189
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,600
My apologies.

190
00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:23,920
This young man...

191
00:08:24,439 --> 00:08:25,240
I'll drink one as a penalty.

192
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,320
It is projected that by the end of 2024,

193
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,279
the returns will be exceptionally high.

194
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,679
They show a clear growth trend.

195
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,519
Furthermore, according to market distribution data,

196
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:43,240
the US holds the largest market share,

197
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,519
but the proportion of the Korean market

198
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:45,600
will also increase significantly.

199
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,320
His proposal is viable.

200
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,159
Well said.

201
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,360
Very well said.

202
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:53,919
Isn't it?

203
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:17,559
Meili.

204
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,519
There's something I've been wanting to say.

205
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,279
Don't rush.

206
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,279
I believe in you.

207
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,919
Say it when you're ready to.

208
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:41,679
When you don't want to say it,

209
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,480
let's just hug first.

210
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:24,200
Let's talk.

211
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:26,639
About...

212
00:10:28,039 --> 00:10:28,840
Lin Han.
