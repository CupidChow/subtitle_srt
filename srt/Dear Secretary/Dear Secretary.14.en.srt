1
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,200
Secretary Lin, before this,

2
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:23,840
have you ever been in a relationship?

3
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:25,959
Once.

4
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:30,560
So you really liked that girl?

5
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:32,400
What am I saying?

6
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:33,680
At a romantic moment like this,

7
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,359
I'm actually asking if he loved his ex?

8
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,359
Darn it, darn it.

9
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:38,239
No wonder I've been single for thirty years.

10
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:40,519
I liked her a lot back then.

11
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:42,280
I thought we wouldn't break up.

12
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:44,799
Darn it.

13
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,560
You're really honest.

14
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:47,680
But...

15
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:49,840
But what?

16
00:01:50,439 --> 00:01:51,519
But I don't miss it.

17
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,560
This might be hard to believe,

18
00:01:55,239 --> 00:01:57,599
but from the moment I learned I never had her true heart,

19
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:01,079
everything felt like it was severed.

20
00:02:02,439 --> 00:02:03,599
Remember what I told you?

21
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,960
A Ferris wheel doesn't stay still forever.

22
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:12,199
People have to move forward too.

23
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:18,759
For the road ahead,

24
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,199
can I keep holding Meili's hand?

25
00:02:30,759 --> 00:02:32,599
So you all know.

26
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:33,560
You know too.

27
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:36,400
When I saw it this morning,

28
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,759
it was mind-blowing!

29
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:38,639
Isn't it though?

30
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:39,879
When I saw it this morning,

31
00:02:39,879 --> 00:02:40,919
I was totally stunned.

32
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,159
Yeah.

33
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,560
It's finally out in the open.

34
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:46,759
Secretary Xue!

35
00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:47,919
You know too, right?

36
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:49,879
Shocked, huh?

37
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,199
Want to join us?

38
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:51,520
Right!

39
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:55,240
What?

40
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,400
That new hotpot place!

41
00:02:57,479 --> 00:02:58,120
Half price for couples.

42
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:58,960
It's a rare deal.

43
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:01,319
Let's pretend to be couples and snag a deal!

44
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:02,039
Secretary Xue!

45
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:02,759
Want to come?

46
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:03,000
Let's go!

47
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,159
We'll wait for you downstairs!

48
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:04,599
Hurry up!

49
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:05,080
Come on!

50
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,319
You have to come!

51
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:07,360
Hurry!

52
00:03:09,879 --> 00:03:10,719
Does this company's

53
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:13,039
average IQ even exceed 70?

54
00:03:13,719 --> 00:03:15,840
I should just go back to the bubble tea shop.

55
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:20,479
President Qin.

56
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:21,520
This is the Qin Group's

57
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,520
rosewood furniture new product launch event proposal.

58
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:25,120
Please take a look.

59
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,080
The theme for this event is

60
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,000
"Qin's New Rhythm, The Home Furnishing Standard."

61
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:30,400
The event's purpose is

62
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,439
to showcase the Qin Group's

63
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:32,479
Let's have lunch together.

64
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:37,639
Okay.

65
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:40,159
Should I book your usual restaurant?

66
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:41,080
I'll make the reservation.

67
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,199
No.

68
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:43,960
That restaurant...

69
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,280
Secretary Lin and I have been there too often.

70
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:48,479
I don't want to go there with my boyfriend.

71
00:03:49,719 --> 00:03:51,039
How about we...

72
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,039
Boss!

73
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:03,120
is not in the office right now.

74
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,680
Meili.

75
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,560
Are you sure about this place?

76
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:11,000
I'm the Qin Meili who doubled the group's profits in a year,

77
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,840
won the industry's Most Influential Person award

78
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,919
for three consecutive years,

79
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:16,399
successfully expanded into five overseas markets,

80
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,639
and whose marketing strategy

81
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:18,759
boosted the company's brand awareness

82
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:21,319
by 80% in three months.

83
00:04:21,319 --> 00:04:22,040
I can handle

84
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,160
Your order is complete.

85
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:25,879
Enjoy your meal.

86
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:27,000
Thank you.

87
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,199
Meili.

88
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:30,000
How did you find this place?

89
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:31,560
From my feed.

90
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,600
Your feed?

91
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:35,680
Thanks.

92
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,120
Let's post on our feeds.

93
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:46,680
"First Honey Love Hotpot of autumn.

94
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,959
Must be shared with your beloved."

95
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,839
Send me the hotpot place's address from your feed.

96
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:00,920
Oh no.

97
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:03,000
I forgot to block the company!

98
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:04,920
Don't tell me...

99
00:05:05,079 --> 00:05:06,639
Secretary Lin saw it too?

100
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:14,439
Try our secret recipe.

101
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:31,759
Boss!

102
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,600
This...

103
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,839
Seeing such a handsome man and beautiful lady, a perfect match,

104
00:05:47,079 --> 00:05:48,040
how about a photo?

105
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,800
Your expressions are so natural.

106
00:05:52,839 --> 00:05:55,199
Would you like it posted on our Honey Love Wall?

107
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,240
Honey Love Wall?

108
00:05:59,879 --> 00:06:02,439
Having it on the wall is so embarrassing.

109
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,079
It's so childish.

110
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,199
Are we in elementary school?

111
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,560
But if I say no,

112
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,879
will he think I'm afraid of going public?

113
00:06:09,879 --> 00:06:11,480
But what if she wants to post it?

114
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:13,160
Would she? Would she?

115
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:14,959
If I really refuse,

116
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,160
will he be disappointed?

117
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:17,759
If I don't accept,

118
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:19,319
will she be angry?

119
00:06:20,439 --> 00:06:22,600
Please, just say no.

120
00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:24,399
Do you want to or not?

121
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:26,000
Give me a hint!

122
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:26,879
Forget it.

123
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:28,079
For Secretary Lin,

124
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:29,319
I'll embarrass myself just this once.

125
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,720
Still can't do it.

126
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,399
Since Meili likes it,

127
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,600
I'll just go for it.

128
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:35,680
But...

129
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,839
We can't.

130
00:06:42,439 --> 00:06:44,879
Secretary Lin, you don't like it, right?

131
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,480
How could I not like it?

132
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:48,959
It's Meili who doesn't like it, right?

133
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:51,600
He's asking if I like it.

134
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,160
Seems he really likes it.

135
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:54,040
Makes sense.

136
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,680
With a perfect girlfriend like me,

137
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,600
of course he'd want people to know.

138
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,040
This is giving me a headache.

139
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:01,720
It's a test, isn't it?

140
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:03,120
It absolutely is.

141
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:04,879
Just like when she got angry last time.

142
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:05,839
A life-or-death question.

143
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:06,439
Oh my god.

144
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,160
Then I'll say...

145
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:09,800
I really like it.

146
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:12,040
Thank you so much!

147
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:25,279
The girl is so beautiful.

148
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:26,439
The guy is so handsome too.

149
00:07:26,439 --> 00:07:27,759
Like a celebrity ad.

150
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,519
So many people must be envious.

151
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:30,680
Wait a second.

152
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:34,240
Quick, say no!

153
00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:35,399
Say it!

154
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:37,560
Once it's stuck on, there's no chance left.

155
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,279
It's a test.

156
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:41,360
Definitely.

157
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,600
Don't worry, Meili.

158
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:43,680
I get it.

159
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:45,720
Please don't forget the heart-shaped sticker.

160
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,399
Okay.

161
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,519
This looks way too much like her.

162
00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:07,680
No.

163
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,000
Definitely not.

164
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,199
How could President Qin come to a place like this?

165
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,000
Absolutely not.

166
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:15,920
Just quit.

167
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,319
Right now.

168
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,079
Would you folks like to take a photo?

169
00:08:20,839 --> 00:08:22,480
No, thanks.

170
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,120
Even though I pass by here every day,

171
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,120
I've never actually walked down here.

172
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:47,399
Yeah.

173
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,399
Such an ordinary, mundane day...

174
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:51,519
I really wish it could just keep going like this.

175
00:08:52,519 --> 00:08:54,039
You like an ordinary life.

176
00:08:54,759 --> 00:08:56,240
Where nothing much happens.

177
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,679
And it can stay just like this.

178
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,279
Lin Han.

179
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,240
I want to talk to you.

180
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,960
Everything that needed to be said has been said.

181
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,639
Let's go.

182
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,879
You're already together.

183
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,279
With your female boss.

184
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:17,200
That's none of your business.

185
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,320
I already know.

186
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,759
That thing you've been hiding from me.

187
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,960
Do you want me to say it in front of her?

188
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:28,679
Meili.

189
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,600
Can you go home by yourself first?

190
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:52,240
Now.

191
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,759
We can talk now.
