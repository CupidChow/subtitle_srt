1
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:12,920
What are you looking at?

2
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,480
I'm looking to see

3
00:01:14,599 --> 00:01:17,000
if that's the sun or the moon hanging there.

4
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:19,599
These past two weeks,

5
00:01:19,599 --> 00:01:21,159
my sons have all come back to visit.

6
00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:22,959
I'm afraid I can't handle all this good fortune.

7
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:27,879
Hey, Xiao Hai.

8
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,519
Did the art exhibition go well?

9
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,040
It went quite well, Mom.

10
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:31,959
And...

11
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:34,280
it wasn't just the exhibition that went well.

12
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,120
What do you mean?

13
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,200
Could it be...

14
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,040
my eldest son is seeing someone too?

15
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:45,599
Mom.

16
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:48,079
We're still just in the dating phase.

17
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,959
But I really like her.

18
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:51,840
I believe it won't be long

19
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,640
before I bring her home

20
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:53,599
to meet you and Dad.

21
00:01:54,519 --> 00:01:55,239
That's great.

22
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,000
I have to go meet someone later.

23
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:00,400
Don't go.

24
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,479
You seem very concerned about Mr. Mo Fei.

25
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:13,599
I don't like this person.

26
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:17,560
Did you know each other before?

27
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,599
Is there something

28
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:23,919
you can't tell me?

29
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:26,319
I just want to confirm some things from the past.

30
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:34,039
I don't like anyone

31
00:02:34,039 --> 00:02:35,280
interfering in my private affairs.

32
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:35,639
Including...

33
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:36,319
Including me?

34
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,400
Anyway, I'm going to meet him.

35
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:43,960
And I hope Secretary Lin

36
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:44,960
won't stop me again.

37
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:53,240
Xiao Hai.

38
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,560
Tell Mom quickly,

39
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,000
what kind of girl is she?

40
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,479
She is very smart.

41
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:02,280
And...

42
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:03,879
cheerful and strong.

43
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,159
Her family background is also quite good.

44
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,039
By the way,

45
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:08,960
your younger brother knows her too.

46
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,159
Really?

47
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:13,159
I have something to do, I'm leaving first.

48
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,080
My sensible youngest son

49
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,520
is really so polite.

50
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:41,560
To be honest,

51
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,960
when I went to see you that day,

52
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,240
I wasn't very confident

53
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,159
that you would come to see me.

54
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:47,840
Actually, I

55
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,199
have always been very interested

56
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:50,280
in Mr. Mo Fei's

57
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,280
Ferris Wheel Series.

58
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,360
So,

59
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,960
I wanted to know the source of your inspiration.

60
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,719
That is a story that is both thrilling

61
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:01,039
and heartwarming.

62
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,639
Thrilling?

63
00:04:06,199 --> 00:04:07,360
When I was ten years old,

64
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,719
I got separated from my younger brother at the amusement park.

65
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,080
I was pushed into the Ferris wheel by the crowd.

66
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,639
Look.

67
00:04:22,279 --> 00:04:22,920
There.

68
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,399
Look over there.

69
00:04:31,399 --> 00:04:32,480
Is it that one?

70
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,360
But suddenly, an accident happened.

71
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,439
Sister, I'm scared.

72
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:42,120
Little brother.

73
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,759
Don't be afraid.

74
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,759
Sister Meili will protect you.

75
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:48,000
Little brother, don't be afraid, okay?

76
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,800
Sister Meili will protect you.

77
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:51,759
I was trapped inside

78
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,120
for a full four hours.

79
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:54,800
Don't be afraid, don't be afraid.

80
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,160
Four hours of fear.

81
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,279
Don't be afraid.

82
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:58,600
Sister Meili...

83
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,519
But fortunately,

84
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,240
will protect you.

85
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:01,439
the one with me...

86
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:02,240
Little brother...

87
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,399
was a little girl.

88
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,439
You are Little Brother Lin?

89
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,360
When I met you for the first time,

90
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,160
I said that

91
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,279
we had met before.

92
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,759
And Miss Qin,

93
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:15,879
you also know my younger brother.

94
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,839
He is Lin Han.

95
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,399
Secretary Lin.

96
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:21,399
But...

97
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:22,720
isn't your surname Mo?

98
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,399
Let me reintroduce myself.

99
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,120
I am Lin Hai,

100
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:29,600
Lin Han's older brother.

101
00:05:57,839 --> 00:05:58,639
Meili!

102
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,120
Where did you run off to?

103
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,439
I've been looking everywhere for you.

104
00:06:02,439 --> 00:06:03,920
Didn't I tell you not to run around?

105
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:04,600
This is her mother.

106
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:04,959
Are you okay?

107
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:05,519
I'm fine.

108
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:06,319
As long as you admit it.

109
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:07,639
Is this his mother?

110
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,959
Is this a new friend you've made?

111
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:10,000
Probably, probably.

112
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:11,839
Why are you all alone?

113
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:12,920
Mom.

114
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,279
He is Little Brother Lin.

115
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,319
Little brother,

116
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,480
what is your name?

117
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,759
My name is Lin...

118
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:24,040
That little boy back then was named Lin...

119
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,360
Lin...

120
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:32,959
Hello, Secretary Lin?

121
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,199
Are you feeling any better?

122
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:36,160
Um...

123
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,480
will you come to the hiking trip tomorrow?

124
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,639
Hiking?

125
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,399
I can, no problem.

126
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,720
Great, that's great!

127
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,519
Done.

128
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:52,800
Get your gear ready.

129
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:05,920
President Qin.

130
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,040
Are you looking for Secretary Lin?

131
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,560
He didn't come today either.

132
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:10,920
I know.

133
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:12,160
He's sick, right?

134
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,199
He needs some rest.

135
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:14,680
Sick?

136
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:17,920
Didn't he just agree to go hiking tomorrow?

137
00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:21,000
Hiking?

138
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,720
Oh, right.

139
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:23,920
The department gathering.

140
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,360
They say it happens every year.

141
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,319
You didn't know?

142
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:28,360
I didn't know.

143
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:29,920
That's why I said last time,

144
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,000
this is isolation.

145
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,040
It's discrimination.

146
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,279
It's workplace bullying.

147
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:34,759
But...

148
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,480
but this is a company event.

149
00:07:55,079 --> 00:07:55,879
Fine.

150
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:01,240
Hurry up and keep up.

151
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,279
How did we go from drinking heavily at the foot-of-mountain inn

152
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:22,720
enjoying a happy two-day, one-night getaway

153
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,319
to

154
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,920
actually climbing a mountain?

155
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:26,680
Why?

156
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,240
I even wore high heels

157
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,040
for Secretary Lin.

158
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,279
Every year around this time,

159
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:33,679
she completely forgets about it.

160
00:08:33,879 --> 00:08:35,200
Someone must have tipped her off.

161
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:36,399
Who among us

162
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,080
has the biggest mouth?

163
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:45,480
Keep it up, everyone!

164
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:47,080
We're almost at the summit.

165
00:08:47,559 --> 00:08:48,360
Boss,

166
00:08:48,759 --> 00:08:49,879
everyone is very tired.

167
00:08:49,879 --> 00:08:50,919
Should we take a break?

168
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:51,840
Tired?

169
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,440
How could you be tired?

170
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,799
We've only been climbing for a short while.

171
00:08:54,919 --> 00:08:55,960
Three hours.

172
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:56,679
You have to understand,

173
00:08:56,679 --> 00:08:57,519
not everyone

174
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:59,120
can be as exceptional as you are.

175
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,200
Yes, boss.

176
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,440
How about we split into two groups?

177
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:06,960
The tired group rests here,

178
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,919
and those who aren't tired keep climbing.

179
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,440
We'll stay in touch.

180
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:11,919
Anyway, later tonight

181
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:13,279
we still have to meet up at the inn.

182
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:14,080
Right?

183
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:14,960
Fine.

184
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,320
So, who's not tired?

185
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,159
Come with me.

186
00:09:21,639 --> 00:09:23,279
Looks like it's just me.

187
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:26,919
Alright, let's go then.

188
00:09:27,559 --> 00:09:28,639
Hurry up, you guys!

189
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:29,440
Bye!

190
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:31,000
Okay, bye.

191
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:48,559
Boss,

192
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:49,799
your phone.

193
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,039
Hello?

194
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,519
My dear Meili,

195
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,679
what are you doing?

196
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:03,080
That kind of address

197
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,399
is quite embarrassing.

198
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:07,840
Sorry.

199
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:10,559
I was just calling you like I did when we were kids.

200
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,440
Ever since we talked the other day,

201
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,279
I've been missing you a lot.

202
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,279
I wonder when we can meet again.

203
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,639
When I need you to.

204
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:26,679
You're still the same as when you were little,

205
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:28,039
direct and decisive.

206
00:10:29,559 --> 00:10:30,360
Well then,

207
00:10:30,679 --> 00:10:31,559
I'll wait for you.

208
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,039
Let's go.

209
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:58,080
Secretary Lin,

210
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:01,000
do you want to rest for a bit?

211
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,159
Okay.

212
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:33,360
What is it?

213
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:38,200
Don't move.

214
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:01,960
There's a first-aid bandage in the bag.

215
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,279
There, that should be fine.

216
00:12:11,559 --> 00:12:12,840
We'll get it checked at the hospital later.

217
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:15,559
You already know, don't you?

218
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:17,759
Lin Hai,

219
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:19,639
also known as Mo Fei,

220
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,720
is my older brother.

221
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,120
I already know.

222
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,720
Why do you cling

223
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,639
to the past?

224
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:32,080
The past is in the past.

225
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,320
It holds no meaning.

226
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:34,879
Just like a Ferris wheel

227
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,960
doesn't stay still forever.

228
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:41,679
Why did you hide it from me?

229
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,080
Because I didn't want to know.

230
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:50,000
Because I don't understand why

231
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,120
you keep dwelling on

232
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,759
things that don't bring happiness.

233
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,639
Because, Secretary Lin...

234
00:13:04,039 --> 00:13:04,840
What?

235
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:07,360
Because I've always been thinking,

236
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,000
if only that person were you.

237
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,559
Because if it were you,

238
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:15,840
our meeting

239
00:13:16,039 --> 00:13:17,559
would be meant to be.

240
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:19,960
And there would be no regrets.
