1
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:12,359
Marriage proposal

2
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:15,000
How can you even drink this cheap booze?

3
00:01:19,239 --> 00:01:20,640
It's not even strong, it's fine.

4
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:22,239
Cheap booze.

5
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,760
As in low-quality.

6
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,159
Drink it if you like it, or get lost.

7
00:01:26,599 --> 00:01:27,840
Alright, alright, I'll drink it.

8
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,359
So?

9
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:30,799
Did he say yes?

10
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,000
Well, he didn't exactly refuse me.

11
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:06,599
Secretary Lin.

12
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:07,439
What is it, boss?

13
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,360
You haven't answered my question yet.

14
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,560
You mean...

15
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:15,840
Currently, I...

16
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:17,599
have no plans to get married.

17
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,759
Don't worry about not being good enough for me.

18
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:27,639
I don't care about that.

19
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,639
*I* care.

20
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,800
You...

21
00:02:32,439 --> 00:02:33,439
care about me?

22
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:34,840
No, boss.

23
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,199
What I mean is...

24
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,159
A woman as perfect as you...

25
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,039
should be with an even more perfect man.

26
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:41,960
I'm really not suitable.

27
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,879
Qin Meili.

28
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,680
That's a rejection.

29
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,560
A one hundred percent rejection.

30
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,360
But he said I'm perfect.

31
00:02:51,319 --> 00:02:52,120
Sis.

32
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,439
Do you think anyone would say...

33
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:54,960
that their own boss is crazy?

34
00:02:55,919 --> 00:02:57,000
And I think...

35
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,479
you're really quite twisted.

36
00:02:59,719 --> 00:03:00,479
To keep Secretary Lin...

37
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:01,919
by your side forever...

38
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:04,560
you'd resort to a trick like marriage.

39
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:05,800
What else can I do?

40
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,719
Who told him to be the most...

41
00:03:07,719 --> 00:03:09,240
all-around secretary I've ever seen?

42
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:10,960
Let me tell you.

43
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,719
Only someone that capable...

44
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:13,520
is worthy of me.

45
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,800
Qin Meili's high-intensity work...

46
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,680
But...

47
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,639
He really did reject me.

48
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:22,120
It's pretty obvious.

49
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:26,520
Then why did he say...

50
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,960
he wants to be my husband?

51
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:28,879
What?

52
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,719
Who said you're not suitable?

53
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,520
Boss, your foot...

54
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,400
has been fine for a while.

55
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,039
The doctor said...

56
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:38,120
there's nothing wrong.

57
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,039
I was just pretending...

58
00:03:40,039 --> 00:03:41,639
so you'd take care of me.

59
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,520
But why?

60
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,599
Because you've been with me...

61
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:45,800
like a shadow for three years.

62
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,400
We even spend holidays together.

63
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,759
The time we spend together...

64
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:52,080
could be said to be more than a married couple.

65
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,599
But a husband and a secretary...

66
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:57,479
are still different, President Qin.

67
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,039
But if you marry me...

68
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,560
you can start a new life...

69
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,199
and still be my secretary.

70
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,199
I'm sorry.

71
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,240
I really don't want to be your secretary anymore.

72
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:18,040
So...

73
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:20,839
He said he doesn't want to be my secretary.

74
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,879
Doesn't that mean he wants to be my husband?

75
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,240
You really are a logical genius.

76
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,720
I'm speechless.

77
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:30,600
I've never seen a narcissist like you.

78
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:32,399
Good thing Secretary Lin didn't agree.

79
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,959
Otherwise, he'd be your workhorse for life.

80
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:34,920
That's too tragic.

81
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,199
Inhumane.

82
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,800
Why can't I...

83
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,439
marry him because I like him?

84
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:40,360
Do you like him?

85
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,079
Hey, Secretary Lin.

86
00:04:58,079 --> 00:04:59,120
Come pick me up.

87
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:00,839
Boss...

88
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:03,040
It's 2:30 in the morning.

89
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:05,639
The employee work schedule...

90
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:06,600
starts at 6:30.

91
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:25,959
Living hell.

92
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:26,480
I quit.

93
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,639
I quit right now.

94
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:30,680
Where are you going so late?

95
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:35,879
That smile of yours...

96
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,240
is really creepy.

97
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,319
Tell me...

98
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:45,040
what kind of person makes an employee...

99
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,240
get up for work at 2:30 AM?

100
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:49,040
Definitely not a human.

101
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:50,720
It's definitely a beast.

102
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,480
A cruel, heartless...

103
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,920
and inhumane beast.

104
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:54,959
Well said.

105
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:56,560
High five.

106
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:02,040
Hey, Hanzi.

107
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,360
Where exactly are we now?

108
00:06:05,959 --> 00:06:07,040
My back...

109
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,120
feels strangely cold.

110
00:06:17,959 --> 00:06:18,720
Slow down

111
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:19,759
Watch your head

112
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,439
How much did he drink?

113
00:06:24,439 --> 00:06:25,160
To get like this?

114
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,160
Hanzi, what's going on?

115
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:26,480
I'm not drunk.

116
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:26,839
No, this...

117
00:06:26,839 --> 00:06:27,399
He's drunk.

118
00:06:27,399 --> 00:06:27,879
Not drunk.

119
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,839
Why is it you?

120
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,199
You know each other?

121
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,399
More than just know.

122
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,240
Meili.

123
00:06:37,079 --> 00:06:38,000
Look at this face.

124
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,439
This person is our...

125
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:40,959
Selfish, cringey, greasy, and unlucky...

126
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:42,800
And prostatitis-suffering man-child ex-husband.

127
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:44,800
Mr. Ex.

128
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:47,839
Hanzi.

129
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:49,000
Let me introduce her to you.

130
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:49,759
This one...

131
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,480
Is our sarcastic, mean, scheming, black-hearted...

132
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,720
Who only cares about fame and fortune...

133
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,839
And doesn't care if others live or die...

134
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:55,920
Ex-wife.

135
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,600
Seems like lately you've been...

136
00:06:58,639 --> 00:06:59,720
Not doing too well.

137
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,959
Before I saw you...

138
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:02,439
I was doing great.

139
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,079
Don't tell me...

140
00:07:03,079 --> 00:07:03,600
You two talk.

141
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,600
We're leaving first.

142
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:05,120
You're already divorced.

143
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,000
What son do you have?

144
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:06,800
Who had a son with you?

145
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,279
Let me tell you, my son's meals must be top-notch.

146
00:07:08,279 --> 00:07:09,120
At least four dishes a day.

147
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:09,639
Got it?

148
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:10,120
Shut up, you.

149
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:10,879
Didn't I say I'd hit you...

150
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:11,439
Every time I see you?

151
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:12,279
I'll really do it.

152
00:07:12,279 --> 00:07:13,199
You dare try, just you try.

153
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:14,199
What are you doing?

154
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:15,720
Go on, hit me!

155
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,639
Shrew!

156
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:18,199
No, you...

157
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:20,439
Secretary Lin.

158
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,879
Darn it.

159
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:38,920
I'll hit you, I...

160
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:40,560
Don't you leave!

161
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:43,240
You stand there and let me hit you!

162
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,279
Stop hitting!

163
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,920
I'll beat you to death today!

164
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,839
Secretary Lin.

165
00:07:58,839 --> 00:08:00,399
Get married.

166
00:08:00,759 --> 00:08:02,279
Let's get married.

167
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,360
If we marry, you won't have to resign.

168
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:29,839
Secretary Lin.

169
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:32,960
Marry.

170
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:35,919
Marry.

171
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:39,240
Secretary Lin, marry.

172
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,720
Secretary Lin.

173
00:10:07,799 --> 00:10:08,480
Son.

174
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:09,879
You should still come with me.

175
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,399
I'll guarantee you a life of luxury.

176
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:14,200
And after you're with me...

177
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,240
All your things...

178
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:15,720
I will all...

179
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,080
What is that?

180
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:20,679
What, what?

181
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:21,720
No, you, this...

182
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,600
So early in the morning...

183
00:10:22,759 --> 00:10:24,240
Up so early?

184
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,159
I didn't wake up early.

185
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,559
I didn't sleep.

186
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:30,440
I love to drink.

187
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,639
But my tolerance isn't great.

188
00:10:32,039 --> 00:10:33,559
You could say it's a...

189
00:10:33,559 --> 00:10:34,600
Small flaw in my perfect life.

190
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,200
But a flaw can't hide the jade's beauty.

191
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,519
You must be ready to take me home anytime.

192
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:40,799
Of course.

193
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:42,000
Men and women are different.

194
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:43,960
Changing clothes won't be necessary.

195
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,159
Also...

196
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,000
I have high standards for skincare.

197
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:50,039
So...

198
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,159
You must remove my makeup for me.

199
00:10:51,159 --> 00:10:53,159
Wash my face, apply serum, night cream.

200
00:10:55,639 --> 00:10:56,559
Oh, and also...

201
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,320
Don't forget to put a glass of honey water by my bedside.

202
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,559
Do you understand everything?

203
00:11:07,799 --> 00:11:08,720
Didn't sleep, huh?

204
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:11,000
Then you should have some coffee.

205
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:13,399
So what was it, really?

206
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:16,039
I already said it's nothing.

207
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:16,919
Hey, no...

208
00:11:16,919 --> 00:11:17,720
Wait a minute.

209
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,320
That thing you just mentioned...

210
00:11:21,159 --> 00:11:22,200
And then?

211
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,720
Don't tell me you, you punk...

212
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,519
Of course not.

213
00:11:28,679 --> 00:11:29,679
Absolutely.

214
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:31,440
You promise?

215
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,799
I swear.

216
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,639
Secretary Lin.

217
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,000
Secretary Lin.

218
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,399
Marry.

219
00:12:54,159 --> 00:12:55,240
Be a man.

220
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:56,360
Fine.

221
00:12:56,799 --> 00:12:57,919
Then let's have coffee.

222
00:12:57,919 --> 00:12:58,679
I'll wash.

223
00:12:58,679 --> 00:13:00,120
I'm going to take a shower.

224
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,320
That thing isn't there either.
