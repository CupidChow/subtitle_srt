1
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:50,079
You two seem to have a great relationship.

2
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:51,879
Should we put the photo up on the wall?

3
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,040
No, I don't want to.

4
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,079
Why not?

5
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:56,079
Don't you want to make it public?

6
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,640
Are you embarrassed to be with me?

7
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,159
That's not it at all!

8
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:00,280
Then why?

9
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:01,519
I just don't want to put it up.

10
00:02:01,719 --> 00:02:02,719
So childish.

11
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:03,799
What's childish about it?

12
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:04,200
Help us put it up.

13
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,000
Help us put it up.

14
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:07,799
Sure thing!

15
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,599
President Qin.

16
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,039
What is it?

17
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,159
What's this?

18
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,039
This is what Secretary Lin sent me last night.

19
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:56,759
What are you looking at?

20
00:04:56,759 --> 00:04:57,560
Go on in.

21
00:04:57,879 --> 00:04:58,680
Where's Secretary Lin?

22
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,759
Seriously, Old Qin?

23
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:02,839
I'm your own daughter!

24
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,759
Why are you always thinking of others at a time like this?

25
00:05:05,079 --> 00:05:05,959
You dislike me that much?

26
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:06,480
Then I'm leaving.

27
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,720
What do you mean 'others'?

28
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,199
Isn't he your boyfriend?

29
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,399
Him...

30
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,680
We broke up.

31
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,360
Look at you.

32
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,959
I told you.

33
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:22,079
When you're in a relationship,

34
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:22,959
you have to be reasonable.

35
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,399
Were you too willful again?

36
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,920
Who can stand you being so self-centered?

37
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,519
Say something!

38
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:29,720
Exactly.

39
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,560
It's all because you spoiled her.

40
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:32,879
Look at this personality.

41
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:33,759
What do we do?

42
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:34,959
She takes after you, I'm telling you.

43
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:36,199
I didn't tell you to criticize her.

44
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:37,160
Why are you blaming me?

45
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:37,600
Dad, Mom.

46
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:39,279
I have work at the company, I'm leaving.

47
00:05:39,399 --> 00:05:40,399
Hurry up and arrange them for her.

48
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,839
Twenty meetings a day, you hear?

49
00:05:42,279 --> 00:05:43,680
I refuse to believe not one will be suitable.

50
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,160
I can arrange thirty if I have to.

51
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,560
But Secretary Lin is a good person.

52
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,199
He is a good person.

53
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:48,319
But your daughter won't have it.

54
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:50,399
Why did she leave?

55
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:53,120
Look what you did.

56
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:54,759
So stubborn.

57
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,519
Look at you.

58
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:08,079
I told you, when you're in a relationship, you have to be reasonable.

59
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:09,680
Were you too willful?

60
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,759
You're so self-centered.

61
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:11,959
Who can stand you?

62
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,079
I'm sorry, miss.

63
00:06:23,079 --> 00:06:24,199
The park is closed for the day.

64
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:25,079
We're not admitting any more visitors.

65
00:06:25,079 --> 00:06:26,040
Sorry, sorry.

66
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,000
She made a mistake.

67
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:27,759
Please, go right in.

68
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,680
You stopped her?

69
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,879
That's Young Master Lin's girlfriend.

70
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:36,560
What?

71
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,360
You didn't know?

72
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,600
She was the one who came with him last time.

73
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,319
Then why did they come separately this time?

74
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,360
Maybe...

75
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,480
I hope Secretary Lin never leaves.

76
00:08:58,639 --> 00:08:59,440
I love you.

77
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,399
Qin Meili.

78
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,399
I can't hear you!

79
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,240
I love you!

80
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,039
Can't hear you!

81
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,200
I love you!

82
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,279
I love you, Qin Meili!

83
00:09:47,559 --> 00:09:48,000
Let's go.

84
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:48,480
I don't want to go.

85
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,360
Don't pull me.

86
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,320
Stop pulling me!

87
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,039
I'm not going.

88
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:51,360
No way.

89
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,080
I carefully picked out that bridesmaid dress.

90
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,240
When did I agree

91
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,080
to be your bridesmaid?

92
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:55,840
I'm not going.

93
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,679
You're so heartless.

94
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:57,200
Let's go.

95
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,360
I'm not going.

96
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:01,679
To make up for last time's regret,

97
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,039
and to prevent tragedy from happening again,

98
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:08,480
we've decided to give you a big gift.

99
00:10:09,559 --> 00:10:10,519
Take this!

100
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,639
So incredibly childish.

101
00:10:13,639 --> 00:10:14,320
Don't embarrass us.

102
00:10:15,879 --> 00:10:17,000
We've already remarried.

103
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,080
How can you talk

104
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:19,840
so harshly still?

105
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,200
I...

106
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,279
That was just a reluctant compromise for the kids.

107
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,360
Who isn't doing it for the kids?

108
00:10:29,559 --> 00:10:30,360
Hurry up and look.

109
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:03,639
Is this a bridesmaid dress?

110
00:11:15,159 --> 00:11:15,960
I'm sorry.

111
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:18,240
I really didn't know

112
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,200
how to find you

113
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,519
without being rejected.

114
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,039
Marry me.

115
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:32,320
Will you marry me?

116
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:33,320
Qin Meili.

117
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,240
But I said...

118
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:38,679
I...

119
00:11:38,679 --> 00:11:39,159
I accept.

120
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,559
I accept that I'm the one who was chosen.

121
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,799
Because you are Qin Meili.

122
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,120
And I believe in Qin Meili.

123
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:01,120
I do.

124
00:12:03,159 --> 00:12:03,960
So sweet.

125
00:12:46,519 --> 00:12:47,039
That's...

126
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,120
That's it?

127
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:49,759
Nothing more?

128
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:50,879
What else?

129
00:12:52,679 --> 00:12:54,080
There has to be a wedding!

130
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,080
Right!

131
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,360
Otherwise, all our

132
00:12:57,679 --> 00:12:58,600
hard work

133
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:00,320
was for nothing?

134
00:13:01,559 --> 00:13:02,200
Forget it.

135
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:02,799
Wrap it up, everyone.

136
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:03,000
Never mind.

137
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:04,480
Let's go.

138
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,200
Groom

139
00:13:10,519 --> 00:13:11,759
Do you take this

140
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:13,159
beautiful lady as your wife?

141
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,919
For better or for worse,

142
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:16,279
in sickness and in health,

143
00:13:16,559 --> 00:13:18,480
to have and to hold,

144
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,120
to love her,

145
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,159
to cherish her,

146
00:13:21,159 --> 00:13:22,000
and to care for her,

147
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,000
till death do you part?

148
00:13:24,919 --> 00:13:25,720
I do.

149
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:27,279
Bride

150
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,519
Do you take

151
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,279
Enough with the talk.

152
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:29,840
I do.

153
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,279
Then let's do it.

154
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:33,559
We don't have the ring.

155
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,000
The ring.

156
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,320
Okay.

157
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,519
Grow old together.

158
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,960
We're finally done, right?

159
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:02,360
Not yet.

160
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:04,759
What else?

161
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,559
A new, beautiful chapter of life

162
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:18,879
is about to begin.

163
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:21,120
Yes.

164
00:15:21,679 --> 00:15:23,120
My dear secretary.
