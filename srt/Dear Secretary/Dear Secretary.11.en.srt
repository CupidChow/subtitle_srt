1
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:11,840
Why aren't they back yet?

2
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:13,719
Don't tell me...

3
00:01:13,719 --> 00:01:14,760
They got lost?

4
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:16,120
Their phones are off too.

5
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,200
I'm starving to death.

6
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,719
Who knows, maybe they went on a date.

7
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:21,480
A date?

8
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:22,760
They're back.

9
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:23,959
Isn't that Secretary Lin?

10
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:25,599
This...

11
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,000
Back so early?

12
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:29,719
President Qin.

13
00:01:29,719 --> 00:01:30,200
Have a seat.

14
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:37,640
Well, President Qin...

15
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,599
Let's start eating then.

16
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:39,599
Everyone's hungry.

17
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:40,599
Let's eat.

18
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41,560
The hotpot here...

19
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,400
Is absolutely top-notch.

20
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,599
We order it every time we come.

21
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,319
Every single time.

22
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:49,319
To celebrate President Qin...

23
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:49,920
Attending for the first time...

24
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,159
Our Secretarial Department's team building.

25
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:52,000
I propose we all...

26
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:52,799
Have a drink together.

27
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:53,239
Great!

28
00:01:53,239 --> 00:01:54,120
Come on, come on.

29
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:54,599
Cheers, cheers!

30
00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:55,120
Boss.

31
00:01:55,959 --> 00:01:57,280
To protect your image...

32
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,719
Please drink in moderation.

33
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:00,879
Don't worry.

34
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:02,400
I know my limits.

35
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,799
Come on, let's toast.

36
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,840
Thanks for your hard work.

37
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:12,960
Titi.

38
00:02:14,199 --> 00:02:15,280
Let me ask you...

39
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,039
Are you...

40
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:18,719
In love with our Secretary Lin?

41
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:20,000
Yes.

42
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:22,520
But you always hog him.

43
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:25,039
You don't even share the broth with us.

44
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:26,039
What can I do?

45
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,240
It's because Secretary Lin...

46
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,080
Doesn't like you.

47
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,719
Doesn't like me?

48
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,240
Then does he like you?

49
00:02:32,439 --> 00:02:33,479
Of course he does.

50
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:40,680
At this table...

51
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:43,319
Is there anyone who doesn't like me?

52
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:45,319
We like you.

53
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:45,919
No, no.

54
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:46,280
We like you.

55
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:46,960
Probably not, right?

56
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,400
Penalty drink!

57
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:52,960
What's the matter, boss?

58
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,199
I'm sorry.

59
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:55,840
Because we reserve rooms...

60
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,560
Based on your headcount each visit.

61
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,520
We reserve rooms.

62
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,120
This time, for some reason...

63
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,560
You have an extra person.

64
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:04,319
So...

65
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:06,000
There are no extra rooms, is that it?

66
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:07,960
I'm very sorry.

67
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:08,400
It's fine.

68
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:09,759
Don't worry about it.

69
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:10,800
Okay.

70
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:12,560
Come on, come on.

71
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:13,680
Let's have a toast.

72
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:14,719
Come on, come on.

73
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:15,599
Cheers!

74
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:16,960
Let's toast.

75
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,800
Take it easy.

76
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:24,240
I'm fine.

77
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,120
Secretary Lin.

78
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,080
I wore these high heels for you.

79
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,520
She's had too much to drink.

80
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,319
Secretary Lin.

81
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,560
I'll take Titi back.

82
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,360
She drank too much today.

83
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,840
Don't take what she said to heart.

84
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,520
Take good care of our President Qin.

85
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,080
Bye-bye.

86
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,800
I'm not drunk.

87
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:38,639
What is it?

88
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:39,360
Han.

89
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,160
I miss you.

90
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:42,920
If there's nothing else, I'm hanging up.

91
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:43,439
Don't.

92
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:44,360
Don't be so cruel.

93
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:44,759
I...

94
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,600
You're still the same as before.

95
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,000
Lin Han.

96
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,879
It was very hard for me alone abroad.

97
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:05,959
I happened to meet someone...

98
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,319
Who could understand me.

99
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,480
So I felt a bit grateful.

100
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:11,920
Maybe I hadn't experienced enough.

101
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:13,800
And thought that was love.

102
00:06:14,439 --> 00:06:15,480
I'm not interested...

103
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,639
In any of your affairs.

104
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,519
But we've been together since university.

105
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,920
We've always been a good match.

106
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:22,560
Do you remember that...

107
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,279
I'm not interested in the past either.

108
00:06:24,279 --> 00:06:25,240
I'm leaving first.

109
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:27,439
Lin Han!

110
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,079
For the sake of me being alone...

111
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:31,600
And having come such a long way...

112
00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:32,959
Accept me, okay?

113
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,720
I really miss you.

114
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:36,720
At least for now...

115
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,680
Don't make me leave.

116
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:41,839
I'm all alone...

117
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,319
It's really dangerous.

118
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,480
This way, please.

119
00:06:53,959 --> 00:06:54,800
Mm, okay.

120
00:07:12,439 --> 00:07:14,319
This young lady is really lucky.

121
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,639
This is a room...

122
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:16,959
A guest has booked long-term.

123
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,639
I just called and asked.

124
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:20,000
She's not staying here tonight.

125
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,360
So you can stay here for now.

126
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:22,439
Okay.

127
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,639
Then you stay here for now.

128
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,160
Leave when it's light out.

129
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:27,680
Lin Han.

130
00:07:28,279 --> 00:07:29,439
Give me another chance.

131
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,800
Let's start over.

132
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,680
Okay?

133
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:35,720
You really never understood me.

134
00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:16,279
Sorry.

135
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,959
I thought you were staying here.

136
00:08:17,959 --> 00:08:18,879
I just went to get gas.

137
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:20,879
Sorry to keep you waiting.

138
00:08:21,399 --> 00:08:23,120
In the future, learn from Secretary Lin...

139
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,319
How to manage your time.

140
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:25,399
Ah, okay.

141
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:26,399
By the way...

142
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,279
Isn't Secretary Lin with you?

143
00:08:36,759 --> 00:08:37,600
Secretary Lin?

144
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:38,840
Oh, yes.

145
00:08:39,639 --> 00:08:40,279
That's right.

146
00:08:40,279 --> 00:08:41,399
President Qin is in the car.

147
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:44,360
Alright, alright, don't worry.

148
00:08:45,159 --> 00:08:45,960
Okay.

149
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,879
Time Assassin

150
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:53,759
Lao Wang

151
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,000
From now on, you can call him Lin Ike.

152
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,440
Why did you leave early?

153
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,759
Why do you care about my business?

154
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:11,919
Did I do something

155
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:13,519
to make you angry?

156
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:16,240
Yes. Very angry.

157
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,720
What can I do to make you not angry anymore?

158
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:25,720
Does Secretary Lin talk to everyone like this?

159
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:28,080
What?

160
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,919
Player.

161
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:31,720
Indiscriminately caring for every woman.

162
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:33,639
Are you the Ambassador of Tenderness, may I ask?

163
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,440
You're jealous.

164
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:39,440
No.

165
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,679
Let's be together, Meili.

166
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:46,720
What?

167
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:49,759
If this will make you stop being angry,

168
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,360
Someone who once gave their heart freely was betrayed.

169
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,559
It always seems to take a long time

170
00:10:13,559 --> 00:10:14,919
to accept it calmly.

171
00:10:16,919 --> 00:10:18,600
But I don't know when it started,

172
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,120
maybe the first time I saw her

173
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,039
do that kind of thing for me.

174
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,679
Or maybe, even earlier.

175
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:29,879
My heart was slowly occupied by her,

176
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:30,799
until it was completely full.

177
00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:33,120
Only today did I realize

178
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:34,159
that I

179
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,600
am very afraid of losing her.

180
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,759
I want to be with her.

181
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,759
Once that thought sprouts,

182
00:10:40,759 --> 00:10:42,080
it can never be diminished.

183
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,879
Let's be together, Meili.

184
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:46,519
My Big Sis.

185
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,000
Just like our first pinky promise.

186
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,639
Who on earth gave him the courage?

187
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:52,559
Lao Wang.

188
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:53,399
Who do you think it was?

189
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,080
Are you talking about Secretary Lin?

190
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:57,879
Oh, right.

191
00:10:57,879 --> 00:10:59,399
When I was checking you out just now,

192
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:01,440
the landlady said rooms were scarce,

193
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:03,159
so she specially freed up a room for him.

194
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:04,840

195
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,000
Out here in the deep mountains,

196
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,360
staying outside for a night

197
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,720
does require some courage.

198
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:09,759
What did you say?

199
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:11,480
You...

200
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,440

201
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,000
Turn the car around.
