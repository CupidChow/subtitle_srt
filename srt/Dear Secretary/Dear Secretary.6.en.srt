1
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,799
Three hundred

2
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:14,079
Three hundred and one

3
00:01:17,959 --> 00:01:18,760
Hanzi

4
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,359
I've been feeling really weak lately.

5
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:23,920
Working for Ms. Qin

6
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,519
must be exhausting, huh?

7
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,000
Get lost.

8
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,120
A 24/7 corporate slave life.

9
00:01:37,719 --> 00:01:39,159
Anyone would be worn out.

10
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:40,840
It's been three years.

11
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:43,480
Remember Vanka from the elementary school textbook?

12
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,760
I've been a bonded laborer for three years.

13
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,640
Finally, I see a glimmer of hope.

14
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,439
What goes around comes around.

15
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:54,000
Heaven spares no one.

16
00:01:54,359 --> 00:01:55,439
This is retribution.

17
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,680
Retribution.

18
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,359
What are you talking about?

19
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,000
Nothing.

20
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:02,719
Um...

21
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,640
Ms. Qin...

22
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:05,799
Is she willing to let you go?

23
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,560
I don't know either.

24
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:09,759
But the good thing is,

25
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:11,120
she hasn't bothered me these past two days.

26
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:12,639
That's good.

27
00:02:13,639 --> 00:02:15,840
She actually hasn't summoned me for two whole days.

28
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:17,759
So you really...

29
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:19,159
don't like me?

30
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:20,800
I don't.

31
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:30,919
Hanzi!

32
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:35,719
Lin Hai is back.

33
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:39,000
And...

34
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:41,000
Talk tonight.

35
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:42,879
Come home for dinner.

36
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:44,759
Chairman Lin's orders.

37
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,080
Hurry up.

38
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,080
Hurry, hurry!

39
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:06,840
This counts as burglary, doesn't it?

40
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,280
I must be crazy.

41
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,879
Spending a weekend acting insane with you.

42
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:11,719
The locks for this house

43
00:03:11,719 --> 00:03:12,599
were all bought by me personally.

44
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:13,479
How can this be considered...

45
00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:14,680
Quick, quick, quick!

46
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,360
Keep your voice down.

47
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,159
Stop.

48
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:19,919
Hurry.

49
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:25,199
Looks like the code hasn't changed.

50
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,479
Tofu!

51
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,599
Tofu!

52
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,039
Tofu!

53
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:40,400
Tofu!

54
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,120
You go that way.

55
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:44,879
I'll go this way.

56
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,039
Tofu!

57
00:03:47,719 --> 00:03:48,520
Tofu!

58
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,919
My little Tofu!

59
00:03:54,199 --> 00:03:56,280
Weren't my slam dunks just awesome?

60
00:03:56,639 --> 00:03:57,479
Alright.

61
00:04:13,639 --> 00:04:14,879
I heard your brother is back this time

62
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:15,520
to hold a painting exhibition.

63
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,199
I don't know about that.

64
00:04:17,319 --> 00:04:18,279
Don't tell me.

65
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,000
I think...

66
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,560
Actually, between you two brothers,

67
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,399
you could be a little...

68
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:27,439
What was that sound?

69
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:29,959
Grab it, grab it!

70
00:04:29,959 --> 00:04:30,759
Take it!

71
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,480
Go, go, go!

72
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:40,680
You...

73
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,360
You, you, you...

74
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,680
What are you d-doing?

75
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:45,279
How come after the divorce,

76
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,480
you quit being a doctor

77
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,639
and switched to theft?

78
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:49,000
Theft?

79
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:49,759
Are you insane?

80
00:04:49,879 --> 00:04:50,480
I'm entering my own home.

81
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,160
How is that theft?

82
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:53,759
*Your* home?

83
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,399
We agreed during the divorce,

84
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,519
this house is mine.

85
00:04:56,519 --> 00:04:57,519
How did it become *your* home?

86
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,000
Fine, the house is yours.

87
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:00,360
Then Tofu is mine, right?

88
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,920
Tofu is because you claimed him for yourself.

89
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:04,160
You didn't give me visitation rights.

90
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,519
I haven't even complained.

91
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,279
You... you want visitation rights?

92
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:08,399
Are you worthy?

93
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,519
How did you carry him for ten months and give birth?

94
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:13,079
How can you still be so mean?

95
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:13,759
Not at all.

96
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:14,560
I'm not... what?

97
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,600
Secretary Lin.

98
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,120
Let me tell you,

99
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,360
men, you're really disgusting.

100
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,360
Just shut up.

101
00:05:18,439 --> 00:05:19,160
If you're going to say that,

102
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:19,639
you, you, you...

103
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:20,160
What?

104
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,279
I'll say it.

105
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:21,920
So what?

106
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:22,560
Let's talk inside.

107
00:05:23,079 --> 00:05:23,560
You shut up.

108
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,240
Hi, Secretary Lin.

109
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:24,600
Get out.

110
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:27,480
Sorry about that.

111
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,199
Secretary Lin.

112
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,040
Bye, Secretary Lin.

113
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:13,279
They're arguing their way to the bed again.

114
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:14,319
Yeah.

115
00:08:14,839 --> 00:08:15,959
Same as always.

116
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,040
Today is the weekend.

117
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,000
Right.

118
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,600
It is the weekend.

119
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:24,600
The weather is nice today.

120
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,399
Boss.

121
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,159
Just forget it all.

122
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:44,159
Forget about Secretary Lin too.

123
00:08:46,279 --> 00:08:49,000
Forget about today.

124
00:08:50,679 --> 00:08:52,279
Secretary Lin today...

125
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,320
forget about him too.

126
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:00,080
You can't forget, can you?

127
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,840
You can't forget Secretary Lin either, right?

128
00:09:48,679 --> 00:09:49,480
Mom

129
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:53,960
Your son is home.

130
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,799
You must be tired. Come inside.

131
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:00,039
In my lifetime...

132
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:01,879
...to see my eldest son again.

133
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:03,399
I'm truly blessed.

134
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,120
Dad.

135
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,600
Life as an artist treating you well?

136
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:08,679
Not bad.

137
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:11,639
Before your work becomes immortal...

138
00:10:11,639 --> 00:10:13,639
...you still remember your aging parents.

139
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,879
Such a filial son.

140
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,759
The Virtuous Artist indeed.

141
00:10:16,759 --> 00:10:17,639
Great artist.

142
00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:23,440
Dad's still talking like that.

143
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,159
Yeah.

144
00:10:25,159 --> 00:10:25,960
Come on, son.

145
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,960
Your dad's all bark and no bite.

146
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,360
Don't mind his sarcasm.

147
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:37,080
He actually knew you were coming back.

148
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,440
He's been happy about it for a week.

149
00:10:41,159 --> 00:10:42,039
Hey, old man.

150
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:44,120
If you want to see your son, come out.

151
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,360
Stop eavesdropping.

152
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,000
Mom.

153
00:10:55,159 --> 00:10:56,120
Lin Han.

154
00:10:56,799 --> 00:10:57,919
Still working as a secretary?

155
00:10:58,559 --> 00:10:59,360
Still am.

156
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:02,039
Back then, for that girl...

157
00:11:02,039 --> 00:11:03,679
...you ran away from home for independence.

158
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:06,360
Then I heard you got dumped.

159
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,279
Your father found out.

160
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,919
He told him to return to the Lin Family immediately.

161
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,480
He said he'd come back later.

162
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:14,960
I suppose it's my fault.

163
00:11:15,639 --> 00:11:16,759
I raised the child...

164
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,240
...to be too responsible.

165
00:11:18,919 --> 00:11:19,720
Mom.

166
00:11:20,759 --> 00:11:22,080
Little brother has always been outstanding.

167
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:23,559
I think...

168
00:11:23,879 --> 00:11:25,279
...he must have his own plans.

169
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:27,080
A bit willful, perhaps...

170
00:11:27,159 --> 00:11:28,639
...but he's a good kid.

171
00:11:28,919 --> 00:11:30,279
Very reliable.

172
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:33,679
Your father's and my greatest pride...

173
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,879
...is having you two sons.

174
00:11:56,039 --> 00:11:57,039
Come home soon.

175
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,679
Your older brother is already back.

176
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,399
It's a must.

177
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,200
Don't even think of making excuses.

178
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:03,440
At the very least...

179
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,120
...let your dad and me, in our lifetime...

180
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:07,559
...see the whole family reunited.

181
00:12:08,679 --> 00:12:09,600
I understand.

182
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,720
Looks like they won't...

183
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,480
...be done anytime soon.

184
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,279
I have something to attend to. I should go.

185
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:19,320
I was just about to leave too.

186
00:12:19,799 --> 00:12:20,759
Let me give you a ride. It's on my way.

187
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:23,480
Alright.

188
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,639
What's wrong with this elevator?

189
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,639
Hello? The elevator is broken.

190
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,039
We're trapped inside.

191
00:13:12,039 --> 00:13:13,200
Please come fix it.

192
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:14,320
Okay, copy that.

193
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:15,200
Wait for our rescue.

194
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:18,120
Darn it. What a piece of junk.

195
00:13:21,559 --> 00:13:22,639
Are you okay, Secretary Lin?

196
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:23,240
What's wrong?

197
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:24,440
Secretary Lin?

198
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Secretary Lin!

199
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:27,639
What's the matter with you?

200
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:30,799
Don't go.

201
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,159
Don't go.

202
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:33,679
Don't go.

203
00:13:33,799 --> 00:13:35,480
I'm not going.

204
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,639
I'm right here.

205
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:39,960
It's okay.

206
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,399
It's okay.

207
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:42,120
It's okay.

208
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,080
It's fine. It's fine.
