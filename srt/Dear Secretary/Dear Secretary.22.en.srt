1
00:01:17,319 --> 00:01:18,920
You all go ahead and prepare.

2
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:34,959
Thank you.

3
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:38,000
This is the first time you've thanked me.

4
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:39,319
Is that so?

5
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:41,840
Is everything ready?

6
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,200
How do I look today?

7
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:49,719
Absolutely stunning.

8
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:52,920
Let's go.

9
00:01:56,519 --> 00:01:57,359
It's starting.

10
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,000
This is our company's most important

11
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,359
event for the second half of the year.

12
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:01,680
Absolutely.

13
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:02,599
It took so long

14
00:02:02,599 --> 00:02:03,799
to develop this new product.

15
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:05,680
We must achieve a complete victory.

16
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,240
Our Qin Group's

17
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,000
newly launched Beautiful Home Collection

18
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,360
combines traditional craftsmanship with modern fashion.

19
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,840
We are committed to providing consumers

20
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,400
with higher quality products.

21
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,199
First is this designer sofa.

22
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,400
Its inspiration comes from...

23
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,080
This product is plagiarized!

24
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,520
Plagiarism?

25
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,240
What?

26
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,960
This is Hongmu Group's original product!

27
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,039
It can't be.

28
00:02:41,719 --> 00:02:42,759
Maybe it's true.

29
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,039
Secretary Lin, this...

30
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:48,599
Secretary Li, have security immediately

31
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:50,080
check that person's entry credentials.

32
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:50,919
Secretary Xue.

33
00:02:50,919 --> 00:02:53,240
Record the live stream and all comments as evidence.

34
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:03,400
Our Qin Group's

35
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,439
products are all original designs.

36
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,439
Sir,

37
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:08,719
you're making baseless accusations of plagiarism.

38
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,919
Do you have any proof?

39
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:13,800
Secretary Lin.

40
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:14,520
Cici.

41
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,599
Go to the design department immediately

42
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:16,719
and retrieve the design sketches.

43
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:17,800
Okay.

44
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,360
Titi.

45
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,680
Check the secretary's email immediately.

46
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:22,120
Capture the cloud drive timestamps for designer file exchanges.

47
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,080
Okay.

48
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:23,919
Haha.

49
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:24,879
Look into Hongmu Group's

50
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:26,360
all similar products from the last three years.

51
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:26,840
Okay.

52
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,240
Chichi.

53
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,400
Contact the designer.

54
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,520
Have him provide a written statement and sign it.

55
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:31,879
Once everyone is done,

56
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:33,039
send it to me immediately.

57
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:33,879
Okay, understood.

58
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:36,159
Of course I have evidence.

59
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,199
Are you willing to confront it right here?

60
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:46,599
I never expected this.

61
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,360
See?

62
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:51,520
This is a product from Hongmu Group

63
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,039
that started pre-sales in physical stores

64
00:03:53,319 --> 00:03:54,759
last week.

65
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,879
The two sofas look

66
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,360
identical in appearance.

67
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:02,479
It's been investigated.

68
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:03,319
It's a false accusation.

69
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:04,680
Repeat after me.

70
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,159
Everyone, please look.

71
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:07,879
The photo provided by this gentleman

72
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:08,800
does bear some resemblance

73
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,319
to our new product.

74
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:11,639
Everyone, please look.

75
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:13,280
The photo provided by this gentleman

76
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,520
is indeed somewhat similar to our new model.

77
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:16,759
But that's all it is.

78
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,839
But that's all it is.

79
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,480
When our company produced this sofa,

80
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,600
When our company produced this sofa,

81
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,319
we focused on the overall design concept

82
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:25,319
and detail handling.

83
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,680
The design team, guided by the concept of beautiful living,

84
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,240
referenced various cultural elements

85
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,399
and traditional craftsmanship.

86
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,680
After repeated research and revisions,

87
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:34,680
we finally created this product.

88
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,959
Your words are baseless.

89
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:37,439
You just asked me for evidence.

90
00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:38,800
Well, where is *your* evidence?

91
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:42,720
Everyone, look.

92
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,600
These are our design sketches.

93
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:46,160
From the initial concept

94
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,240
to the final form,

95
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,399
everything is meticulously documented.

96
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,000
Note this timestamp.

97
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,399
Note this timestamp.

98
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,360
The design sketch was completed on March twenty-third.

99
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,120
After revisions and refinements,

100
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,680
the final design was confirmed on May seventeenth.

101
00:04:57,879 --> 00:04:58,959
However, as far as I know,

102
00:04:59,319 --> 00:05:01,480
Hongmu Group's so-called original product

103
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:03,720
first appeared on August second.

104
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,879
first appeared on August second.

105
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:08,160
This is clearly later than our design timeline.

106
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,160
The above is sufficient to prove

107
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,079
that our design is original

108
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:13,040
and not plagiarized.

109
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:14,959
Well said.

110
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:15,879
Exactly.

111
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,240
He has no evidence at all.

112
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:21,680
This is our designer's written statement and public notice.

113
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:25,639
Sir,

114
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:26,839
our Qin Group

115
00:05:26,839 --> 00:05:28,639
had no obligation to prove our innocence today.

116
00:05:28,839 --> 00:05:29,959
But under pressure,

117
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:31,399
we had no choice but to do so.

118
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:32,639
Sir,

119
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:33,920
as far as I know,

120
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,360
you are a distributor for Hongmu Group, correct?

121
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:37,920
Although I don't know

122
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,120
what your purpose is,

123
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:41,319
after this press conference concludes,

124
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:43,160
we will file a lawsuit against you personally

125
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,319
and Hongmu Group.

126
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,480
We will demand compensation for

127
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,120
all losses incurred by our company.

128
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,639
It has to be Secretary Lin.

129
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:00,920
Absolutely.

130
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:01,720
Thank goodness.

131
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,839
Otherwise, with a crisis like this,

132
00:06:02,839 --> 00:06:04,040
we really wouldn't know what to do.

133
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:05,439
Secretary Lin is truly irreplaceable

134
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:06,759
in the workplace.

135
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:08,480
Well then,

136
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:11,000
what about us?

137
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,199
Hurry up.

138
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:15,439
Come on.

139
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,720
Hey, Dad.

140
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:29,759
Meili.

141
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,720
The product launch went really well.

142
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,600
Congratulations.

143
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,839
You watched it too?

144
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:34,720
Yes.

145
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:36,319
You handled it very well.

146
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,680
My daughter is amazing.

147
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:39,600
By the way,

148
00:06:39,879 --> 00:06:42,160
when are you bringing Secretary Lin home?

149
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,879
I heard from your mom

150
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,120
that you're together.

151
00:06:45,879 --> 00:06:46,319
Dad...

152
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,879
I have something to do, gotta go.

153
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:50,240
Hello?

154
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,639
This kid.

155
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,720
It seems Secretary Lin and I

156
00:06:57,399 --> 00:06:58,800
are still too different.

157
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:00,199
So,

158
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:01,000
Boss Qin,

159
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,120
simply can't do without Secretary Lin.

160
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:04,560
Now you understand, right?

161
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,519
Pre-sale orders alone exceeded twenty million.

162
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,240
Boss, you're truly incredible.

163
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:14,759
Today,

164
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,480
was also thanks to Secretary Lin.

165
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,800
Am I

166
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,959
hearing praise again?

167
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:26,959
What's wrong?

168
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,759
What are you thinking about?

169
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,160
Nothing.

170
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:34,639
Let's have dinner together tonight.

171
00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:35,240
Okay.

172
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:36,800
But the department has a celebration dinner.

173
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,120
How about

174
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:37,839
just the two of us?

175
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:40,959
Alright.

176
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:47,959
Do you feel better now?

177
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,480
Your father and I

178
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,879
have something to tell you.

179
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,120
Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake.

180
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,319
I really like this story.

181
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:20,800
I don't know much about music.

182
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:24,319
That might be one of my few shortcomings.

183
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,199
Up until now,

184
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:28,399
there have been quite a few, okay?

185
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,200
Alright.

186
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:32,960
The story

187
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,799
is about Princess Odette by Swan Lake,

188
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:39,039
who is turned into a white swan by a demon.

189
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:41,200
Prince Siegfried

190
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,480
falls in love with her at first sight

191
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,720
and vows to save her.

192
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,919
On the night of choosing a bride,

193
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,320
the demon has his daughter, the Black Swan, impersonate the princess.

194
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,559
The prince eventually sees through the deception

195
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:53,279
and battles the demon.

196
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:54,600
He breaks the spell,

197
00:08:54,919 --> 00:08:57,240
restoring Princess Odette to human form.

198
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,799
The two live happily ever after.

199
00:09:07,639 --> 00:09:08,519
What's wrong with you?

200
00:09:09,159 --> 00:09:10,679
You've been gloomy all day.

201
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,320
About the launch...

202
00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:13,480
Are you unhappy?

203
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,039
Secretary Lin.

204
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,440
I think

205
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,159
you should resign.

206
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:30,480
What?

207
00:09:33,159 --> 00:09:34,720
I want you to resign.

208
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:37,559
Why resign?

209
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,960
Because I don't want to be a bride to be chosen,

210
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,759
nor a princess waiting to be rescued.

211
00:09:47,559 --> 00:09:49,279
I just want to be myself.

212
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,600
What bride and princess?

213
00:09:55,759 --> 00:09:56,799
For so long now,

214
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,360
you've done so much for me.

215
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:02,440
I admit I really need you.

216
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,600
Just like today,

217
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,200
you are, to me,

218
00:10:07,799 --> 00:10:09,360
so irreplaceable

219
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:11,279
and indispensable.

220
00:10:13,639 --> 00:10:15,200
But precisely because of that,

221
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:18,600
I'm very afraid.

222
00:10:21,399 --> 00:10:22,960
Because I truly cannot

223
00:10:24,279 --> 00:10:25,639
I don't have the courage

224
00:10:25,639 --> 00:10:26,480
to entrust my entire future

225
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,559
completely to another person.

226
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,360
Because if, once we...

227
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,080
We what?

228
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:39,200
I need to have a backup plan.

229
00:10:41,879 --> 00:10:43,519
So I hope between us,

230
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,360
we can just be lovers.

231
00:10:48,679 --> 00:10:50,120
Because in my story,

232
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:51,720
from beginning to end,

233
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,480
there is only one prince.

234
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,200
And that is myself.

235
00:10:58,639 --> 00:10:59,679
Yourself?

236
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,399
As the only daughter of a family business,

237
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,679
I have almost never

238
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:06,919
been trusted by anyone.

239
00:11:08,679 --> 00:11:10,000
I'm not like you.

240
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,080
You can go home anytime;

241
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,879
a company awaits your takeover.

242
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:17,159
But what I have today

243
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,039
was earned step by step,

244
00:11:20,039 --> 00:11:22,320
under immense family pressure.

245
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:25,919
So that demands that I

246
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,639
must always strive to be the best at everything.

247
00:11:30,759 --> 00:11:32,120
That's why, all along,

248
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,879
the one I can completely trust and rely on,

249
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,480
other than myself,

250
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,039
is no one else.

251
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,000
Because I'm prepared

252
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,519
to retreat at any time,

253
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:50,279
I must prevent all risks.

254
00:11:51,039 --> 00:11:52,120
Is that what you mean?

255
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:56,080
Didn't you know that from the start?

256
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,000
What are you saying?

257
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,720
Didn't you know from the beginning

258
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,000
how selfish

259
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,399
and self-centered I am?

260
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,720
So why ask me like this?

261
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,840
Must my entire future

262
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,759
be completely controlled by you?

263
00:12:06,919 --> 00:12:08,960
So you're saying I'm just an option for you.

264
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:09,759
Yes.

265
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,600
Because in my life,

266
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,919
there has never been an Option B.
