1
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,120
I just saw it clearly.

2
00:01:45,319 --> 00:01:46,840
No reaction at all.

3
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,239
And you talk about boundaries?

4
00:01:49,239 --> 00:01:50,359
How ridiculous.

5
00:01:52,519 --> 00:01:53,159
Tell me.

6
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:55,120
Could it be that he...

7
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,439
...has psychological issues?

8
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:02,480
I'm really enjoying...

9
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,959
...the feeling of slowly dating Miss Meili.

10
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,199
Don't tell me...

11
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,960
No way.

12
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:25,599
Go pay the fee.

13
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,960
Uh, avoid spicy food.

14
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:30,240
Got it.

15
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,319
Next.

16
00:02:35,479 --> 00:02:36,400
Maintain a regular schedule.

17
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:37,479
Eat a balanced diet.

18
00:02:37,639 --> 00:02:38,680
Avoid excessive indulgence.

19
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:40,439
Go pay the fee.

20
00:02:45,319 --> 00:02:47,319
Director Li, the morning appointments are done.

21
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:48,400
You can go...

22
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,360
Wait, excuse me...

23
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,960
Sis.

24
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,840
What are you doing here?

25
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:06,560
Hanzi, this...

26
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:10,120
This hospital is newly opened.

27
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,199
You know that, right?

28
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:14,120
The attending doctor here is an Ice Queen.

29
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:15,319
A Master of Andrology.

30
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:16,759
No matter what difficult condition...

31
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:18,599
...once she treats it...

32
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:22,000
But what exactly do you need from me?

33
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:25,800
As you know...

34
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:27,520
I've been with Miss Qin...

35
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,960
...Qin Meili, that is.

36
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:30,840
But...

37
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,039
For some reason...

38
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:33,120
...she's always unhappy.

39
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:35,479
So I wanted to ask you...

40
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:37,719
I want to prepare a surprise for her.

41
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,319
Miss Qin!

42
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:45,639
Where?

43
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,599
My mistake, my mistake.

44
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:49,599
Sorry.

45
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:50,520
I saw wrong.

46
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,680
Don't rush, don't rush.

47
00:03:52,919 --> 00:03:54,240
You want my help? Fine.

48
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:56,360
Get me an iced Americano to drink.

49
00:03:57,199 --> 00:03:58,280
Once I have that iced Americano...

50
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:58,800
Right?

51
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,080
Then today's matter...

52
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,319
...I'll take care of it all for you.

53
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:03,680
Deal.

54
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,039
Hurry up.

55
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:14,960
Hey, hello.

56
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:15,759
I need an andrology appointment.

57
00:04:21,879 --> 00:04:22,680
What are you looking at?

58
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,720
Plastic surgery? No way.

59
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,360
Who's as handsome as me?

60
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:36,720
Never seen anyone get plastic surgery to look uglier.

61
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,000
Sit and wait for me, okay?

62
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,800
I'm going to print something.

63
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,399
Don't touch my stuff.

64
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,439
I'm back with it.

65
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:13,639
Stomachache.

66
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:14,600
What's wrong?

67
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,040
My stomach hurts a bit.

68
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,560
Uh, I need to use the restroom.

69
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,639
You get a queue number.

70
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,040
You're going to the bathroom before even drinking the coffee?

71
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:22,000
Hold this for me first.

72
00:06:57,639 --> 00:06:58,680
My coffee.

73
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:01,079
Brew it like this from now on.

74
00:07:03,879 --> 00:07:04,839
Understood?

75
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,639
Whatever you say.

76
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,800
Lin Han, please come to examination room five.

77
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:15,519
Lin Han, please come to examination room five.

78
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,279
Are you Lin Han?

79
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,360
Yes.

80
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:19,800
Come, this way please.

81
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:20,800
Let's go.

82
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:32,240
Secretary Lin.

83
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,840
What seems to be the trouble?

84
00:08:53,879 --> 00:08:55,200
Let's see who it is.

85
00:08:55,559 --> 00:08:57,440
Oh, it's my unlucky Mr. Ex.

86
00:08:59,159 --> 00:08:59,799
What?

87
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,720
Finally came for treatment, huh?

88
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,759
Been having a rough time lately, haven't you?

89
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:07,639
I was just thinking...

90
00:09:07,639 --> 00:09:09,120
...why do I see you everywhere?

91
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,240
To avoid you...

92
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,360
...I've switched hospitals three times.

93
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:11,919
You know that?

94
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:12,919
Could it be that you...

95
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:13,879
...still have feelings for me...

96
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:14,720
...and are stalking me?

97
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,879
I just changed jobs and came here.

98
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:17,720
Furthermore...

99
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,799
I think you don't just have...

100
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:19,840
...a prostate problem.

101
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:20,879
You're also sick in the head.

102
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,240
*I'm* sick in the head?

103
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:23,799
I think *you're* the one who's sick in the head!

104
00:09:23,799 --> 00:09:24,080
Otherwise...

105
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:24,960
...how could you write your own husband...

106
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:25,799
...into your thesis?

107
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:26,519
And discuss it publicly?

108
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:27,279
How impressive you are.

109
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:28,080
Like a lunatic.

110
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,720
Let me give you one piece of advice.

111
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,679
Only those brave enough to face their flaws...

112
00:09:32,679 --> 00:09:34,360
...can truly face their own lives.

113
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,600
You can face it.

114
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,240
How courageous you are, right?

115
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,159
Writing your own husband into your paper...

116
00:09:39,159 --> 00:09:40,080
...into a case study...

117
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,440
...and discussing it at a summit...

118
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,159
...with hundreds of people?

119
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:43,559
How utterly amazing you are.

120
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:44,559
Someone like you...

121
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:45,639
...you're a dagger in a smile...

122
00:09:45,639 --> 00:09:46,240
...needles in your words...

123
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,080
...an assassin of the soul!

124
00:09:47,799 --> 00:09:48,600
You're timid and hesitant.

125
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,159
You're as cowardly as a mouse.

126
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:50,200
You're weak and fragile.

127
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:51,600
You're selfish and self-serving.

128
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,720
You exploit people's pain for your own gain.

129
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,279
You have absolutely no bottom line!

130
00:09:54,279 --> 00:09:54,639
You...

131
00:09:55,559 --> 00:09:57,559
You're fickle and two-timing!

132
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,639
When have I ever been two-timing?

133
00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:01,840
I meant "two-timing"!

134
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,679
You explain yourself clearly!

135
00:10:08,039 --> 00:10:08,720
Li Wan'er!

136
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,080
Who's the one really two-timing?

137
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:23,960
This is the surprise prepared for Miss Qin.

138
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:26,080
A surprise.

139
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:43,080
So the reason you're angry this time is

140
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,240
worrying about that kind of thing?

141
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,759
How could that be?

142
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,919
It's all that gossip Li Wan'er spouting nonsense.

143
00:10:50,919 --> 00:10:51,960
She's always letting her professional habits get the better of her.

144
00:10:52,039 --> 00:10:52,559
Besides,

145
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:54,159
It's not like I haven't... with Secretary Lin.

146
00:10:57,159 --> 00:10:58,080
So...

147
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,679
The surprise you mentioned is...

148
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,679
Because, for some reason,

149
00:11:02,759 --> 00:11:03,960
I always end up making you angry.

150
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:05,519
So I wanted to prepare a

151
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:07,360
traditional, romantic date.

152
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:09,159
A romantic date?

153
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:10,240
Yes.

154
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:12,360
Old Liu has always been an expert in this area.

155
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,080
So I wanted to ask him for advice.

156
00:11:16,279 --> 00:11:18,840
An expert?

157
00:11:21,159 --> 00:11:23,279
That man is a ridiculous clown.

158
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:25,120
That year for our anniversary,

159
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,559
we spent it at the seaside.

160
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,399
The seaside?

161
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,639
That sounds romantic, doesn't it?

162
00:11:29,799 --> 00:11:30,960
Very romantic.

163
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,360
The sea breeze blowing,

164
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,639
sipping some wine,

165
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:36,360
everything was romantic.

166
00:11:36,679 --> 00:11:37,440
Until...

167
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,879
he had someone bring out a cake.

168
00:11:40,039 --> 00:11:40,840
A cake?

169
00:11:41,879 --> 00:11:44,399
A cake with ninety-nine candles stuck in it.

170
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,639
Symbolizing everlasting love.

171
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,120
Sounds nice, right?

172
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:50,960
But as soon as it was brought out,

173
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,960
they were all blown out.

174
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:54,519
We were at the seaside.

175
00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:57,159
We spent four hours relighting the candles over and over.

176
00:11:59,879 --> 00:12:01,159
That's far from all.

177
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,960
There was also a hippie in makeup singing off-key at a bar,

178
00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:05,799
stepping on capybara dung at a surprise animal show in the park,

179
00:12:05,799 --> 00:12:07,440
(stepping on capybara dung)

180
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,159
and getting tangled up like a mummy

181
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,399
in a tent while camping in the suburbs.

182
00:12:11,799 --> 00:12:13,559
Otherwise, why do you think I got divorced?

183
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:18,480
Forget about that "expert."

184
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,519
You don't want it?

185
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:22,000
His ideas have always been... unique.

186
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:22,799
Really, it's not necessary.

187
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,240
I don't need any romantic date.

188
00:12:31,399 --> 00:12:32,960
Because being with you,

189
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:36,320
every single minute and second is...

190
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:54,639
At this moment,

191
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:57,240
I decide to trust him completely.

192
00:12:57,679 --> 00:12:58,840
No more hesitation.

193
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,840
Love freely, Qin Meili.

194
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:21,840
Sir,

195
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,200
has the person you're waiting for not arrived yet?

196
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,360
We're closing up.

197
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,519
Didn't it go well with Lin Han?

198
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,639
He has absolutely no feelings for me left.

199
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,200
Maybe we should just forget it.

200
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,360
Anyway, I don't really want to be with a secretary.

201
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:48,639
What if I told you

202
00:13:48,919 --> 00:13:50,240
he's not just a secretary?

203
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,080
What?

204
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:53,639
What if I told you

205
00:13:53,919 --> 00:13:55,320
he's the youngest son of the Lin Group,

206
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,080
valued at two billion,

207
00:13:57,519 --> 00:13:59,200
the future successor of the group?

208
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,480
Would that give you more motivation?
