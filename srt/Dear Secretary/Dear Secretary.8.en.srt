1
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,359
Slow down.

2
00:01:11,719 --> 00:01:13,159
What's wrong, Secretary Lin?

3
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:19,120
You...

4
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,079
Are you jealous?

5
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:21,760
I'm not.

6
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,079
I was just talking to that Mr. Mofei

7
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:26,159
a little more than usual.

8
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:27,200
Isn't that perfectly normal?

9
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,000
Stop it.

10
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:29,920
I don't like it.

11
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,719
I don't care what you like.

12
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:36,280
Then why did you say those things?

13
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,159
Things about marrying me and being in love.

14
00:01:39,879 --> 00:01:41,480
Then you unilaterally tell me to forget it.

15
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,879
You do whatever you want.

16
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:44,480
You never consider my feelings.

17
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,519
You stir someone up,

18
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,120
then tell me to forget it.

19
00:01:49,959 --> 00:01:51,879
That's why I don't like you.

20
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:04,000
You've already said you don't like me.

21
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,959
So why care who I talk to

22
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,039
or who I'm warm with?

23
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:45,439
Secretary Xue.

24
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,000
Has the Design Department

25
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,520
submitted next quarter's proposal?

26
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:49,879
What?

27
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:51,759
It was sent to your email last night.

28
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,319
Follow up with the Marketing Department

29
00:02:53,319 --> 00:02:54,639
on the press release copy for next month.

30
00:02:55,319 --> 00:02:56,759
The Marketing Department...

31
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,319
has already been reminded.

32
00:02:58,919 --> 00:03:00,800
They can schedule it by Wednesday at the latest.

33
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:03,000
Where's the latest resource directory?

34
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,000
Here.

35
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:18,280
It seems Secretary Xue won't be able

36
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:20,240
to adapt to the secretary role anytime soon.

37
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,360
We need to post a new job opening.

38
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,439
Are you looking for a new secretary?

39
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,840
Will I be fired?

40
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:28,719
As long as you're willing,

41
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:31,360
I can give you enough time to adapt.

42
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,039
But right now,

43
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,360
I do need a new primary assistant.

44
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,560
Secretary Lin,

45
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,000
I'll leave this matter to you.

46
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:40,719
I hope we can find the right person directly this time.

47
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:42,000
Yes, Boss.

48
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:43,919
I'll arrange it.

49
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,159
Oh, right.

50
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,520
I think I still need a male secretary.

51
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:52,800
Didn't you say a female secretary was more convenient?

52
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,919
I changed my mind.

53
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,280
Do you have any objections?

54
00:03:57,919 --> 00:03:59,800
Boss, you really are capricious

55
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:01,599
and hard to predict.

56
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:01,879
Yes.

57
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,439
Capricious

58
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:05,360
and unpredictable.

59
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,439
That's just my nature.

60
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,719
You've been with me for three years.

61
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,159
Aren't you clear on that by now?

62
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:10,240
Secretary Lin,

63
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,519
the coffee is good.

64
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:25,319
I'm glad you like it.

65
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:26,199
Get back to work.

66
00:05:00,439 --> 00:05:01,319
Ms. Qin.

67
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:02,279
We meet again.

68
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:04,519
Mofei, what brings you here?

69
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,319
Please, have a seat.

70
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,399
I'm here today to sign a collaboration

71
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:09,399
agreement with the Qin Group.

72
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,160
And also,

73
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,680
to come and say hello to you.

74
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,560
What's wrong with Secretary Lin?

75
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:27,439
Just as I thought.

76
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,560
There's something between these two.

77
00:05:33,319 --> 00:05:34,160
About last time,

78
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,160
my apologies.

79
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:38,759
It's nothing.

80
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I feel that

81
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,120
when approaching a woman as charming as Ms. Qin,

82
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,160
even before making contact,

83
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,759
I was already prepared

84
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:46,120
to be envied and resented.

85
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,360
Is that so?

86
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:49,439
Of course.

87
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:52,279
I always feel

88
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,000
we have an unfinished story.

89
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,920
An unfinished

90
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:58,920
story.

91
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:01,920
Ms. Qin,

92
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:05,079
we will meet again.

93
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,040
You've already said you don't like me.

94
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,959
So why care who I talk to

95
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,120
or who I'm warm with?

96
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:47,560
Secretary Lin,

97
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,480
is this the person you found?

98
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:52,199
They were all selected according to your requirements.

99
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,360
Is President Qin not satisfied?

100
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:01,959
Thank you for your hard work, everyone.

101
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,800
We will consider it carefully.

102
00:07:06,439 --> 00:07:07,160
Xiao Xue.

103
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,120
Go and have the next group

104
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,000
No need.

105
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:11,040
Leave the rest to the Human Resources Department.

106
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:11,920
I need a break.

107
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:12,519
President Qin,

108
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:15,079
the interviewees made an effort to come here.

109
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,319
Secretary Lin,

110
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:19,639
You couldn't possibly be

111
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,839
trying to prevent me from finding a new secretary?

112
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:23,680
President Qin,

113
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:24,680
are you...

114
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:26,600
unwilling for me to leave?

115
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,480
It seems Secretary Lin has truly learned

116
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:30,319
the essence in these three years with me.

117
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,439
Extremely self-righteous.

118
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:34,639
I simply don't want

119
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:35,680
to be left with no one to do my work

120
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,519
after you're gone.

121
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,839
President Qin, you're overthinking it.

122
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,319
I just think that compared to looks,

123
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,000
ability is more important.

124
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:46,800
President Qin,

125
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,120
there's only one candidate left.

126
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:49,959
Shall we interview him separately?

127
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,480
Hello, everyone.

128
00:08:03,879 --> 00:08:04,720
Mr. Li Yi.

129
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,480
How come you look

130
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,399
different from

131
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:07,439
the photo?

132
00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:08,720
Sorry about that.

133
00:08:09,079 --> 00:08:12,040
I had some surgery half a year ago.

134
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:13,160
The photo on my resume

135
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,000
hasn't been updated yet.

136
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:21,720
That concludes my self-introduction.

137
00:08:23,079 --> 00:08:24,240
The next question.

138
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,639
Secretary Lin, please ask the question.

139
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,680
Please explain.

140
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:34,240
The basic principles of the Black-Scholes option pricing model.

141
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,279
Then you explain.

142
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:37,559
The Black-Scholes option pricing model's.

143
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:38,320
Basic principles.

144
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:45,000
The Black-Scholes option pricing model.

145
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,399
Determines the price of European options.

146
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:48,399
Assuming an efficient market.

147
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:49,519
The underlying asset price.

148
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:50,879
Follows a geometric Brownian motion.

149
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:51,919
The core formula is as follows.

150
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:52,720
Um.

151
00:08:52,759 --> 00:08:55,879
What are the full names of all past Nobel Prize in Literature winners?

152
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:59,080
Recite the list of all Nobel Prize in Literature laureates.

153
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,480
1901, Sully Prudhomme.

154
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,480
1902, Theodor Mommsen.

155
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,399
1903, Bj...

156
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:10,200
Very good, very good.

157
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,440
The most important thing for a secretary.

158
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:14,879
Is not just ability.

159
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:16,600
But also a sense of time.

160
00:09:17,639 --> 00:09:18,919
From the moment you entered the room until now.

161
00:09:18,919 --> 00:09:20,360
How many seconds have passed in total?

162
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:23,120
How many seconds have passed since you entered the room?

163
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,720
I have a habit of carrying a stopwatch.

164
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,840
It is now.

165
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,399
567 seconds.

166
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,360
Very good, excellent.

167
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:38,759
Your materials.

168
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:40,360
We will consider them carefully.

169
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,279
Secretary Xue.

170
00:09:43,879 --> 00:09:44,960
Please see this gentleman out.

171
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:45,840
Thank you for your trouble.

172
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:46,679
Thank you.

173
00:09:46,759 --> 00:09:47,559
After you.

174
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,240
Why?

175
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:05,200
What?

176
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:06,399
I originally thought.

177
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:08,440
We could be more sincere and straightforward with each other.

178
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:10,159
Because that's how I've been acting.

179
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,440
But recently.

180
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,279
I've been a bit disappointed in you.

181
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:19,000
Did I do something wrong?

182
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,080
You're clearly jealous.

183
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,320
Yet you stubbornly deny it.

184
00:10:24,039 --> 00:10:25,879
You clearly don't want to find me a new secretary.

185
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:27,919
So you use this kind of.

186
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:30,039
This ridiculous method.

187
00:10:32,759 --> 00:10:34,240
Is it so impossible for you to trust me?

188
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,720
To trust me the way I trust you?

189
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:41,799
Yes.

190
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,600
I do need you very much.

191
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,759
But not the kind of need one has for a secretary.

192
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:50,200
But rather like...

193
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:22,879
President Qin.

194
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,120
I'm here to get the resumes of those candidates from earlier.

195
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,200
Secretary Xue.

196
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,000
What is it?

197
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,039
The resumes, right?

198
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,480
I'll send you the resumes later.

199
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,399
You and HR can review them.

200
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:32,600
I think the last one was quite good.

201
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,960
Could go to the Marketing Department.

202
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:35,559
Go on with your work.

203
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,240
Bye.

204
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:45,320
Secretary Lin.

205
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,279
Secretary Lin.

206
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,000
You.

207
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,159
Are you okay?
