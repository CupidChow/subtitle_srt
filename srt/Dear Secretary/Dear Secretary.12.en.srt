1
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,439
What's wrong, Titi?

2
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:15,719
In the middle of the night...

3
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:16,879
I don't know why,

4
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,840
but I have a really bad feeling.

5
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:21,640
See, I knew it!

6
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,519
Something's felt off since last night.

7
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:24,640
Is it really necessary

8
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,120
for us to be this squished?

9
00:01:26,359 --> 00:01:27,640
I don't want to be!

10
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,079
It's Secretary Lin.

11
00:01:29,239 --> 00:01:30,400
He said something came up again

12
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,799
and took the car.

13
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,400
I said it's a date.

14
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,560
Some people are really slow to catch on.

15
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,000
What did you just say to me?

16
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:52,959
Meili?

17
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,799
Will you be with me?

18
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,719
I'll think about it.

19
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:05,879
Since when are you the type to think things over?

20
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,959
I remember someone saying...

21
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:08,759
Saying what?

22
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:10,240
That he didn't like me at all.

23
00:02:10,599 --> 00:02:11,120
And also said...

24
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,759
That he couldn't feel my affection.

25
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,919
And said I was...

26
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:34,960
You haven't said you like me yet.

27
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,039
I did.

28
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,520
I said it many times.

29
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:40,000
Didn't you hear?

30
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,560
I didn't hear it.

31
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,439
Then I'll say it again.

32
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,120
I like you,

33
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,240
Miss Meili.

34
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,199
Will you go out with me?

35
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:47,520
Hello, boss?

36
00:03:48,199 --> 00:03:49,120
What's up?

37
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,520
Nothing in particular.

38
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:54,280
I just wanted...

39
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,280
to hear your voice.

40
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,520
It feels great not needing any excuse.

41
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,479
Just being able to call you whenever I want.

42
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,000
We've only been apart for less than five hours.

43
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:07,080
You miss me already?

44
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:09,479
I never noticed before,

45
00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:10,719
Miss Meili,

46
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:12,319
that you were such a clingy girl.

47
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:15,719
You...

48
00:04:15,719 --> 00:04:16,839
You regret it?

49
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:17,959
A little bit.

50
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:19,759
Really?

51
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,360
If you don't want me to regret it,

52
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:23,839
go to the window right now.

53
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:26,000
Right now?

54
00:04:37,959 --> 00:04:39,079
What are you doing here?

55
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,199
Because...

56
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:41,720
I'm even clingier

57
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:42,959
than Miss Meili.

58
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,680
Do you regret it now?

59
00:04:48,439 --> 00:04:49,240
Silly.

60
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:57,680
You didn't need to get dressed up.

61
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,800
I just wanted to see you.

62
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,680
If I make you go through

63
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,000
all this trouble so late,

64
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,040
I'd feel bad.

65
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:21,519
Being able to see you when I want,

66
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,399
without using work as an excuse anymore,

67
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:24,920
is really nice.

68
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,560
It seems Secretary Lin

69
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:28,839
often mixes business with pleasure.

70
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:30,279
Yeah.

71
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,920
It's been tough.

72
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:34,279
So when did

73
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:35,639
that start?

74
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,720
I don't know.

75
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:39,399
But...

76
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,560
I've always been someone

77
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,079
who's slow to realize things.

78
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,160
So, are you...

79
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,720
coming in?

80
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,480
No, I won't.

81
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,279
Why not?

82
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,399
Because...

83
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:03,120
I'm really enjoying

84
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,439
slowly dating

85
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:05,759
Miss Meili.

86
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:09,279
It's like a piece of cotton candy I finally got.

87
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:11,240
I don't want to gobble it up in one bite.

88
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,759
He really said that?

89
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,959
The sickly-sweet smell of love.

90
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,079
I can't stand it.

91
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,600
What era is this?

92
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:25,160
You two are still acting out that

93
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,399
"boss falls for secretary" drama.

94
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,279
So corny.

95
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:30,639
You're just...

96
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:31,720
jealous.

97
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:32,319
Me?

98
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:33,680
I'm jealous of you?

99
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:35,360
Are you okay?

100
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,680
Look what time it is now.

101
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,240
Three AM again.

102
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:40,959
Secretary Lin isn't with you,

103
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:42,040
so you drag me along.

104
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,519
I'm telling you,

105
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:49,639
you'd better test drive him first.

106
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,279
Tell me something I don't know.

107
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:53,800
I tested him long ago.

108
00:06:53,959 --> 00:06:54,480
Tested him long ago?

109
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,160
You didn't tell me?

110
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:55,920
You...

111
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,040
Let me tell you something...

112
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,800
Hi, Secretary Lin!

113
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:10,720
So gross.

114
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,920
I've really had enough.

115
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:17,480
Tell me,

116
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,519
he couldn't possibly be...

117
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,319
He couldn't have psychological issues, could he?

118
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:27,240
Your professional bias is acting up again.

119
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,319
No, this is a serious issue.

120
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:29,319
I've been burned before.

121
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:31,480
Who's like you,

122
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,319
observing it like a ritual on the 1st and 15th?

123
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:34,680
You're divorced, lady!

124
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,759
Are you an incense burner?

125
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,519
Shut up! Get lost!

126
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:39,680
I'm never drinking with you again.

127
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,480
You're the worst.

128
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:42,439
This proposal...

129
00:07:42,439 --> 00:07:44,199
was revised based on this template, right?

130
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:45,000
Yes.

131
00:07:45,079 --> 00:07:45,800
During the previous meeting,

132
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,120
that's what was said, I believe.

133
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,360
Good morning, President Qin.

134
00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:50,319
Morning.

135
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,639
Nice hairstyle.

136
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:52,879
Hello, President Qin.

137
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,759
That outfit suits you well.

138
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,079
Is this really her?

139
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:58,800
Good morning, President Qin.

140
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:04,079
Don't move.

141
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:07,879
Go on, get busy.

142
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:26,959
Did something provoke President Qin today?

143
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:28,399
Didn't you notice she's just like Secretary Lin?

144
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:29,959
With a smile plastered on her face?

145
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:30,759
Yeah.

146
00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:32,639
Did they bump into something on the mountain?

147
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,919
Need to wash it off?

148
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:35,240
Probably.

149
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,600
We walked on a dark road that day too.

150
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,000
Yeah.

151
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,519
Right?

152
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:38,320
It was that day.

153
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:43,559
The answer is practically written on your faces.

154
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,720
Do you guys know what's going on?

155
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,320
President Qin.

156
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,720
This is the plan for next month's new product launch.

157
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:50,399
Please take a look.

158
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:51,799
To see if we need a meeting to discuss it.

159
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,360
President Qin.

160
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:57,799
President Qin.

161
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:07,279
Oh.

162
00:09:07,559 --> 00:09:08,559
Coffee, right?

163
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,639
Because I was just organizing the Marketing Department's...

164
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:12,399
...materials needed for the meeting later.

165
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:13,639
I haven't had time to prepare it yet.

166
00:09:13,639 --> 00:09:14,799
I'll go get it for you right now.

167
00:09:15,159 --> 00:09:16,120
Secretary Lin.

168
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,840
My false eyelash got in my eye again.

169
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:22,600
Wait a moment.

170
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,080
I'll go get you a cotton swab.

171
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:24,720
It's fine.

172
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:26,080
No need.

173
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:27,679
Go get busy.

174
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,679
Okay.

175
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,000
Secretary Lin.

176
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,159
Your suit is nice.

177
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,240
Boss.

178
00:10:09,399 --> 00:10:10,200
Pretty busy.

179
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,559
Oh, I was just coordinating with Titi on some...

180
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:13,600
Why are you with another woman...

181
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,480
...so intimately?

182
00:10:16,679 --> 00:10:17,840
I don't like it.

183
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:18,679
Also.

184
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,480
Why is your attention...

185
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:22,799
...not on me?

186
00:10:25,159 --> 00:10:26,559
Because I'm working.

187
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:28,720
Working.

188
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:31,759
I understand your uncontrollable feelings.

189
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:32,919
And I'm gratified.

190
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,759
But we are at the company now.

191
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:36,480
Since I am still your secretary.

192
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,440
I hope we can continue as before.

193
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,360
Maintaining a normal superior-subordinate relationship.

194
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:41,600
Otherwise.

195
00:10:41,919 --> 00:10:43,679
I fear it will be hard for us to grasp...

196
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:45,320
...the professional distance after our status change.

197
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:49,159
Professional distance.

198
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,679
Then you flirting with other female staff dressed revealingly...

199
00:10:53,679 --> 00:10:54,879
...counts as having professional distance?

200
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,000
What are you saying?

201
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:58,639
Dressed revealingly?

202
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:09,639
Never mind.

203
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,000
Prepare for the meeting.

204
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,039
President Qin.

205
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:23,720
Next quarter.

206
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,799
We plan to improve...

207
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:26,440
...the brand's online promotion.

208
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:26,960
Therefore.

209
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:27,759
We will be on social media platforms...

210
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:29,320
To actually make you doubt yourself.

211
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,960
Secretary Lin deserves great credit.

212
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,480
...promoting and sales.

213
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:34,120
Including that we will...

214
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,600
...on several popular platforms...

215
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,799
Turning a blind eye to my hints.

216
00:11:37,799 --> 00:11:38,879
So we will coordinate online activities...

217
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:40,200
Could it be...

218
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:42,159
Be what?

219
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:42,840
But if that's the case...

220
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,360
Talk later.

221
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:43,960
I'm very busy right now.

222
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:44,799
Too many patients.

223
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,440
We need to consider the budget issue.

224
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,039
And...

225
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:48,480
Moreover, the bloggers' fan bases...

226
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,440
...may not completely align with our...

227
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,840
What is it?

228
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,320
What exactly are you saying?

229
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,559
Based on click-through rates and conversion rates...

230
00:12:03,559 --> 00:12:04,600
...to filter.

231
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,559
Those with an activity ratio over 35%...

232
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,440
...and reasonable costs will be prioritized.

233
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:09,240
In addition.

234
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,879
Based on the bloggers' fan overlap...

235
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:11,879
...and content relevance...

236
00:12:11,879 --> 00:12:13,320
...conduct a performance evaluation.

237
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,519
Those scoring below 80...

238
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:15,840
...we won't work with them.

239
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:16,799
Such a simple matter.

240
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,559
Does it really require a meeting?

241
00:12:40,919 --> 00:12:41,960
Okay, I got it.

242
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:42,840
I'm coming right over.

243
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:43,639
President Qin.

244
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,000
Where are you going?

245
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,639
Do you need me to accompany you?

246
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,840
Secretary Lin had better not worry about me.

247
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:56,879
Otherwise.

248
00:12:57,039 --> 00:12:59,240
It will ruin the professional distance.

249
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,080
But we are not at the company anymore.

250
00:13:06,039 --> 00:13:07,720
Stirring up someone's emotions...

251
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,480
...while staying safe and sound yourself.

252
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:10,879
The Flirting Bible...

253
00:13:10,879 --> 00:13:12,519
...you must have memorized it by heart.

254
00:13:12,519 --> 00:13:13,519
Secretary Lin.

255
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,000
President Qin.

256
00:13:21,159 --> 00:13:22,039
Lao Wang, drive.

257
00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:33,399
Why so furious?

258
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:35,919
Didn't she just come by?

259
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:40,320
Secretary Xue.

260
00:13:40,759 --> 00:13:41,799
I have something to do this afternoon.

261
00:13:41,799 --> 00:13:42,519
I'm taking leave.
