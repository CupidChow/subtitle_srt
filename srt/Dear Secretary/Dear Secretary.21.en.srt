1
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,159
Older brother

2
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:22,879
What's wrong?

3
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:23,560
What's wrong?

4
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,439
Why are you crying?

5
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,120
Why are you crying?

6
00:01:29,799 --> 00:01:31,319
Xiao Hai

7
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,400
Are you okay?

8
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,040
Xiao Hai

9
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,560
I'm Xiao Hai.

10
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:36,719
Right.

11
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:39,920
You are Xiao Hai.

12
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:41,879
How could you forget again?

13
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:43,719
You are Xiao Hai.

14
00:01:44,359 --> 00:01:45,159
Are you okay?

15
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:51,959
You little brat!

16
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:53,159
You tricked me into going to the amusement park.

17
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:54,359
I'll smash you!

18
00:01:57,719 --> 00:01:58,560
You child!

19
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,159
How are you getting more and more out of line?

20
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:01,560
You're all helping him.

21
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,280
Bullying me.

22
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,359
You don't like me, you like him.

23
00:02:04,359 --> 00:02:05,680
We don't dislike you.

24
00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:07,159
Mom and Dad both like you.

25
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,759
I was wrong, okay?

26
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:12,000
Mom.

27
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,360
No.

28
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,000
You weren't wrong.

29
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,199
It was Mom's fault.

30
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,719
Mom didn't take good care of you.

31
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,039
Does it still hurt?

32
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:25,639
Son, stop messing around.

33
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,800
Let go of me!

34
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:30,599
Let go! I want to get out!

35
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:31,680
Get inside!

36
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:34,159
Let me out!

37
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:35,960
Let me out!

38
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:37,759
I don't want to be here!

39
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:39,520
Don't want to be here!

40
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:40,919
Let me out!

41
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:42,280
Let me out!

42
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,319
Mom!

43
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:48,439
Mom!

44
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:50,879
It's not your fault.

45
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,960
Let me out, quick!

46
00:02:57,159 --> 00:02:58,560
What should we do?

47
00:02:59,319 --> 00:02:59,840
I think...

48
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,719
We should send Xiao Hai away first.

49
00:03:02,439 --> 00:03:04,120
Let the two brothers be apart for a while.

50
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:05,719
It's better for both of them this way.

51
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,719
About that incident in the past...

52
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,120
I've never blamed you for it.

53
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,240
So you don't need to blame yourselves either.

54
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:22,639
After all, all these years...

55
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,879
You've always been by my side.

56
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,879
But older brother only had himself.

57
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:31,680
Since you know...

58
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,599
Why didn't you say it sooner?

59
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,919
Because I didn't want anyone else to get hurt.

60
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,360
An older brother who couldn't face himself...

61
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,960
And parents caught between their two sons...

62
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,319
Mom and Dad in a difficult position.

63
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,599
I didn't want you to get hurt again.

64
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:51,439
Then...

65
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:53,080
That girl...

66
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,080
What do you plan to do?

67
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,639
Girl?

68
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,199
I mean Qin Meili.

69
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,639
That girl from the Qin family.

70
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,080
I remember when I picked you up as a kid...

71
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:05,400
I saw her once.

72
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:06,960
Later...

73
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,240
When you went to work at the Qin Group...

74
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:09,800
I was very worried...

75
00:04:10,039 --> 00:04:11,199
That she would recognize you.

76
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,120
Seeing her again today...

77
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,000
She said she's always remembered that incident.

78
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:16,879
She just never asked you about it.

79
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:17,959
I haven't yet...

80
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,800
You've met her?

81
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,920
You've met Meili?

82
00:04:24,279 --> 00:04:24,959
Yes.

83
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,480
She's quite an impressive young lady.

84
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:28,600
With just a few words...

85
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,439
She left your mother speechless.

86
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,079
She was just short of swearing.

87
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,959
My son's taste is indeed unique.

88
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,120
One in a million.

89
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:39,240
She is formidable.

90
00:04:49,959 --> 00:04:51,639
Secretary Lin has gone home.

91
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,800
He wouldn't...

92
00:05:15,879 --> 00:05:16,800
Secretary Lin?

93
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:18,759
Meili.

94
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:21,240
Let's break up.

95
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,079
You know...

96
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:25,639
I have to consider my family's feelings.

97
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,720
I've been very happy with you this time.

98
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:32,319
But I have to do this.

99
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:34,560
I'm sorry.

100
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,079
Oh dear, what should I do?

101
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,839
The Lin family definitely wouldn't put in a good word for me.

102
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,680
And he's such a self-sacrificing person.

103
00:05:51,399 --> 00:05:53,079
I need to think of a way.

104
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,319
What to do?

105
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,040
Maybe I should just...

106
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:02,959
Meili.

107
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:03,920
I...

108
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:04,959
Han.

109
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,800
Please don't leave me, okay?

110
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,839
Things that make you angry...

111
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:10,079
I'll never do them again.

112
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:10,839
Secretary Li, right?

113
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:12,040
I'll fire him immediately.

114
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,079
I only want you.

115
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:14,120
My Han.

116
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:20,360
No, no, no.

117
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,439
That definitely won't work.

118
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:23,519
I could never do something like that.

119
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:24,920
That's not my style either.

120
00:06:27,399 --> 00:06:29,480
My style should be...

121
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:39,639
Meili.

122
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:40,839
I am...

123
00:06:43,959 --> 00:06:45,800
I've moved all your things here.

124
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:47,079
Starting today...

125
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,319
You will live here.

126
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,680
Without my permission...

127
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:53,199
You are not allowed to go anywhere.

128
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:55,600
Understood?

129
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:02,959
That's the plan.

130
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:04,680
I'll go right now.

131
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,040
Meili.

132
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,639
Secretary Lin.

133
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:25,759
Meili.

134
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:27,439
I want to tell you something.

135
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:30,800
He's probably planning to move back home.

136
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,160
That's why he has a suitcase.

137
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,560
It is on the way home from here.

138
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:36,720
Even breaking up with me was just "on the way."

139
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:39,000
It seems there's no hope at all.

140
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:39,920
If I had known...

141
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,040
I should have made a good impression...

142
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,399
On the Lin family today.

143
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,319
What should I do?

144
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,600
I think...

145
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:47,040
Break up.

146
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,240
I, Qin Meili, am about to be dumped.

147
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,199
Can I move in with you?

148
00:07:58,319 --> 00:07:59,319
I've made up my mind

149
00:07:59,319 --> 00:08:00,480
to be with her.

150
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:04,360
It's best to let that matter end here.

151
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,879
This time,

152
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:08,439
I won't

153
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:11,560
Please don't blame me.

154
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:13,279
Do you really like her that much?

155
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,079
She's the one who made me realize

156
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,079
that instead of considering everyone,

157
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,839
I should fight for myself first.

158
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:28,560
I won't give her up for anyone.

159
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:29,759
This matter,

160
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,560
please don't waste any more thought on it.

161
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,000
Xiao Hai...

162
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:37,720
Dad forgot.

163
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,320
My name is Lin Han.

164
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,080
Dad supports you.

165
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,600
Go be with that Qin Meili.

166
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:47,879
My son

167
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,240
deserves a girl like that.

168
00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:51,559
Really.

169
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,320
You agree?

170
00:08:53,879 --> 00:08:54,679
Really.

171
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,679
Even though she has a bad temper

172
00:08:57,679 --> 00:08:59,279
and says harsh things,

173
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:00,879
we really like her.

174
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:02,279
And we're also proud

175
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:03,600
that my son

176
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,639
has earned her affection.

177
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,679
Treasure it, son.

178
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:09,720
Then...

179
00:09:10,039 --> 00:09:10,679
What about older brother?

180
00:09:12,759 --> 00:09:13,919
I'll accompany him

181
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:15,480
to find the best doctor.

182
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,879
It's what I owed him before.

183
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,679
Don't worry.

184
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,519
Let us

185
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:22,679
face it openly.

186
00:09:24,039 --> 00:09:25,080
Go pursue your happiness.

187
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:25,559
Son.

188
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,080
Mom and Dad both support you.

189
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,679
Because the nights are just too long.

190
00:09:35,799 --> 00:09:37,000
I can't bear

191
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,120
a single minute without Miss Meili.

192
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,080
Can I live here?

193
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:45,720
Live here?

194
00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:48,320
It's not entirely impossible.

195
00:09:48,679 --> 00:09:49,799
But I have conditions.

196
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:50,960
First,

197
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:53,679
your access does not include my bedroom.

198
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:54,639
Second,

199
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,600
you must take care of all my daily needs.

200
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,399
Third,

201
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,559
you must be available at my beck and call.

202
00:10:00,679 --> 00:10:03,279
And you can't easily leave my sight.

203
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:07,399
But the first and third rules contradict each other.

204
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,279
Is that so?

205
00:10:11,159 --> 00:10:12,440
Then it's that during the day,

206
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,559
you can't enter my bedroom.

207
00:10:13,559 --> 00:10:15,080
But at night you can.

208
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,320
No!

209
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:16,960
I mean,

210
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,600
you can't appear in my bedroom at night.

211
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,480
But during the day you ca-

212
00:10:24,759 --> 00:10:26,279
I haven't finished!

213
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,519
Meili.

214
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,960
I've decided not to resign.

215
00:10:32,679 --> 00:10:33,759
Not resign?

216
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,039
Because during your business trip these past two days,

217
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,000
I kept thinking...

218
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,519
Actually, the one who can't be apart from you

219
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,440
has always been me.

220
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,840
I can't leave you.

221
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,480
Not for a day, an hour,

222
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,840
not even a minute or a second.

223
00:10:57,799 --> 00:11:00,399
From back then until now,

224
00:11:01,879 --> 00:11:03,799
it's you who has always given me courage.

225
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:06,440
I just want to stay by your side forever.

226
00:11:07,159 --> 00:11:08,159
Back then,

227
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,960
twenty years ago on the Ferris wheel...

228
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,519
You...

229
00:11:15,919 --> 00:11:17,879
I can finally face that experience.

230
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:33,000
After twenty years,

231
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:34,919
riding the Ferris wheel again,

232
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,600
looking at the one I love before me,

233
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:39,639
there's no more of that fear.

234
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,279
Only peace.

235
00:11:41,799 --> 00:11:42,600
Don't be afraid.

236
00:11:43,039 --> 00:11:44,039
Fortunately,

237
00:11:44,679 --> 00:11:46,320
she is still the same

238
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:49,240
kind sister who got me through my darkest time.

239
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,120
Thank you.

240
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:54,679
Meili.

241
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:56,919
From the moment I decided

242
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:59,000
to be with you,

243
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,879
I secretly vowed

244
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:04,080
I would never let go of this hand holding yours.

245
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,000
Just like our first pinky promise.

246
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,960
Thank you, Sister Meili.

247
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:15,320
Little Brother Lin.

248
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,320
You have to be good.

249
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,919
When you grow up, it'll be your turn to protect me.

250
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,039
Let's pinky promise.

251
00:13:31,879 --> 00:13:32,960
Then what about the Lin family business?

252
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,159
Then we'll have to trouble Old Lin

253
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,559
to retire a few years later.

254
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,919
Are you sure about this?

255
00:13:57,799 --> 00:13:58,600
Wait a minute.

256
00:13:59,879 --> 00:14:01,320
Don't tell me

257
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,320
you're still worried about Secretary Li?

258
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,360
Not just Secretary Li.

259
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,559
I'm also worried about Secretary Zhang,

260
00:14:07,559 --> 00:14:08,320
Secretary Wang...

261
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,879
I'm worried about all the secretaries.

262
00:14:11,159 --> 00:14:11,840
But,

263
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,919
the one I worry about most is still you.

264
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,240
What is there to worry about with me?

265
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:20,440
I'm hungry.

266
00:14:20,799 --> 00:14:22,759
Go make me something to eat.

267
00:14:22,879 --> 00:14:23,879
You didn't eat dinner?

268
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:25,840
Okay.

269
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:26,519
Wait for me.
