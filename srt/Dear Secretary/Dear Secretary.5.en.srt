1
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,120
Could it be

2
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:49,599
that I've been taken advantage of?

3
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,199
Meili?

4
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:16,560
My credit?

5
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,439
What credit?

6
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,000
That bastard Liu Shengqing...

7
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:24,360
took my credit.

8
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,240
The 11th floor is the Business Department.

9
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,400
The 12th floor is the Human Resources Department.

10
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:29,479
This is the 13th floor, the President's Office.

11
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,479
All the surveillance systems

12
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:32,800
are in the Security Department on the first floor.

13
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,960
President Qin arrives at the company at 9:30 AM every day.

14
00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:36,479
Therefore, you must

15
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:37,919
prepare her coffee in advance.

16
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,560
She has an excellent memory,

17
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:41,719
but that doesn't mean your workload is reduced.

18
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,240
So, you need to remember

19
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:43,919
even more than she does

20
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:46,199
to prove your existence is valuable.

21
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:47,879
Also, the language issue...

22
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:49,319
you'll have to figure that out yourself.

23
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:52,400
This will be your workstation.

24
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,319
Secretary Lin?

25
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,280
Is President Qin

26
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:57,000
particularly difficult to deal with?

27
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:57,520
Of course

28
00:02:58,919 --> 00:02:59,680
not.

29
00:03:01,159 --> 00:03:01,759
Secretary Lin,

30
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,840
when you say that,

31
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:03,960
you have to have a conscience.

32
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,120
How long has it been since you had a weekend off?

33
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,120
Do you even remember?

34
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:08,280
Exactly!

35
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,319
Now, the time you have for yourself

36
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:11,039
is less than seven hours a day.

37
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:12,240
Let alone proper rest.

38
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,120
I think what's flowing in your veins

39
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,280
isn't coffee,

40
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,919
it's pure caffeine, Secretary Lin.

41
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:18,120
Don't scare the newbie.

42
00:03:18,759 --> 00:03:19,919
Don't listen to their nonsense.

43
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,960
Secretary Lin,

44
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:24,400
how long has it been since you joined

45
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,680
our team dinners?

46
00:03:25,719 --> 00:03:27,439
You always have something come up last minute.

47
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:28,479
Right!

48
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:30,680
So, come to the dinner tonight.

49
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,639
It's to celebrate Secretary Xue's onboarding.

50
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:33,599
Come on.

51
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:34,439
Yeah.

52
00:03:34,439 --> 00:03:35,159
Join us.

53
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:35,879
Come with us.

54
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:36,479
A team dinner...

55
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:06,120
Who would've thought?

56
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,520
Getting overtime on the very first day.

57
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,000
You started your internship

58
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:11,639
so quickly?

59
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:12,599
Not at the bubble tea shop anymore?

60
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:13,879
What can I say?

61
00:04:14,199 --> 00:04:16,600
The offer was just too good.

62
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,279
Let's all have a toast together.

63
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:30,199
Cheers!

64
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:32,079
So, you never invited me to your gatherings before?

65
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,399
That's because we didn't know

66
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,920
you also like barbecue, President Qin, right?

67
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,000
Yes, yes, yes!

68
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,439
And also, President Qin, look,

69
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:43,959
the environment here is so poor.

70
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:45,279
We were afraid you'd be uncomfortable.

71
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,920
Ah, right, right!

72
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,040
And also because

73
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,720
we were afraid you'd be bored.

74
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:52,680
Because what we talk about here

75
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,879
is, after all, just

76
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,120
the daily lives of 9-to-5ers.

77
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,040
Too mundane,

78
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,000
too ordinary.

79
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,519
Secretary Lin joins often too.

80
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,000
Only occasionally.

81
00:05:04,519 --> 00:05:06,560
It's only when you don't summon me,

82
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,000
which is rare.

83
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,439
This is bullying.

84
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,879
Pure workplace bullying.

85
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,120
You mean

86
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:23,120
we, the employees, are bullying you, the boss?

87
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:28,319
Employees bullying the boss...

88
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,839
What a niche concept.

89
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:31,879
Boss,

90
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:34,360
if you don't want to be bullied even worse,

91
00:05:34,519 --> 00:05:36,879
you should keep your presence to a minimum.

92
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:40,480
Well then, how about

93
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:42,000
to welcome President Qin's arrival,

94
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,240
we raise our glasses for a toast?

95
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:44,560
Come on, come on!

96
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,600
Welcome, President Qin!

97
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:46,879
Cheers, cheers!

98
00:05:56,279 --> 00:05:58,040
Let's play a game.

99
00:05:58,959 --> 00:05:59,720
What do you say?

100
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,160
Right.

101
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,839
Let's play this Compliment Game.

102
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:05,439
Okay, okay!

103
00:06:06,519 --> 00:06:08,120
What's the Compliment Game?

104
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:08,759
It's simple.

105
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:11,040
We just compliment each other.

106
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,319
Like on looks or personality,

107
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:19,240
and of course, ability and all that.

108
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:21,439
As long as each person

109
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:24,000
gives one compliment to everyone else,

110
00:06:24,439 --> 00:06:25,519
mutual appreciation,

111
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,560
then it's done.

112
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:30,240
This game is no good.

113
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:33,040
Why?

114
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,879
Because I have far too many good points.

115
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:36,560
If you had to praise me,

116
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,480
you'd be talking till dawn.

117
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,600
Boss,

118
00:06:40,839 --> 00:06:42,639
not everyone will only compliment you.

119
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:45,240
They'll also choose who to compliment.

120
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,199
But with me sitting here,

121
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:48,560
who would compliment anyone else?

122
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,560
True, true.

123
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,279
How about we play the Criticism Game instead?

124
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:55,680
Criticism?

125
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:57,199
Boss,

126
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:59,279
this game isn't good for team unity.

127
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,120
No boss

128
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,680
wants their employees

129
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,839
to be sworn brothers.

130
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,519
Fine.

131
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,079
The Criticism Game is good too.

132
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,839
Let's do the Criticism Game.

133
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:11,319
So, we...

134
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:12,639
I'll go first.

135
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:14,439
Xixi,

136
00:07:15,079 --> 00:07:15,800
actually, you, you...

137
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:16,920
Your flaw

138
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,240
is quite obvious.

139
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,360
You're just too nice.

140
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,040
Every time we tell you something,

141
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,120
you just say "okay, okay."

142
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:28,040
We never know if you really mean it's good

143
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,240
or if you're just saying it.

144
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,959
Every time I say "okay" to you all,

145
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:34,600
I really, truly mean it's very good.

146
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,839
And you know what?

147
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,160
Whenever I try to say "no,"

148
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:41,879
whenever I try to say "not good,"

149
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,120
I bite my tongue.

150
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:46,560
Are you for real?

151
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,959
Really, look.

152
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:50,079
I want to criticize

153
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,000
President Qin.

154
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:57,360
Your flaw is you don't care if people live or die.

155
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,639
You're always monopolizing our Secretary Lin.

156
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:04,720
What she means is,

157
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,800
you're so beautiful it's lethal.

158
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,600
Yes, yes, yes.

159
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,680
Exactly right.

160
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:10,720
Everyone's had their turn.

161
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:12,399
Then it's my turn.

162
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,240
I want to criticize Secretary Lin.

163
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,959
Because he, towards me...

164
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:18,920
Sex...

165
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:19,680
ual...

166
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:20,639
harassment.

167
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:22,000
What?

168
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,160
No, I mean...

169
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,600
An employee sexually harassing the boss.

170
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:40,200
What a rare case.

171
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,440
Bye-bye.

172
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,679
Bye, Secretary Lin.

173
00:08:44,679 --> 00:08:45,600
No need to see us out.

174
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,039
Take care, take care.

175
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:53,799
Boss?

176
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,080
You haven't left yet.

177
00:08:56,039 --> 00:08:56,840
Secretary Lin,

178
00:08:58,039 --> 00:08:59,639
what you just said...

179
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:02,000
was it all true?

180
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:02,879
Yes.

181
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,399
Contacting the Care Agency for an emergency night visit,

182
00:09:05,639 --> 00:09:06,879
hiring a professional caregiver to come to your home,

183
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:08,679
the cost to change your clothes was very high.

184
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,120
There are payment vouchers

185
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:12,159
and your home security cameras as proof.

186
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:13,799
I clearly remember you said

187
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,039
not to change your undergarments for you.

188
00:09:16,279 --> 00:09:18,120
But I was genuinely worried

189
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,240
about your personal hygiene.

190
00:09:21,159 --> 00:09:22,519
Then why didn't you say so just now?

191
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,919
Not reporting the situation to you

192
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,799
at the first opportunity,

193
00:09:26,919 --> 00:09:28,159
leading to your misunderstanding,

194
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:29,720
is itself a failure in my duties.

195
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:31,559
I shouldn't have such a lapse in my work

196
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:33,200
in my final month.

197
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,399
Secretary Lin,

198
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,879
date me.

199
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:47,720
But I...

200
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:50,120
don't like you, Boss.

201
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,639
Why do you say you don't like me?

202
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,080
Boss, you are truly outstanding.

203
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,360
Kind, with a strong sense of justice,

204
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:05,159
not snobbish,

205
00:10:05,159 --> 00:10:06,159
and exceptionally capable.

206
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,799
These are all excellent qualities.

207
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,480
Apart from being arrogant,

208
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,240
conceited,

209
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,080
lacking empathy,

210
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,320
having terrible drinking manners and tolerance,

211
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,679
and being unable to take care of yourself after drinking,

212
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,960
you have almost no flaws.

213
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:17,360
Secretary Lin,

214
00:10:17,879 --> 00:10:19,840
in the future, you can omit the second half.

215
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:22,879
What about being pretty?

216
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:24,159
Being pretty

217
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:27,000
is your least noteworthy quality.

218
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:30,240
You proposing we date

219
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,960
might just be a momentary whim.

220
00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:33,960
It doesn't mean you truly like me.

221
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,159
Why do you think that?

222
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,639
Because I've never seen you

223
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,799
do anything for me

224
00:10:39,799 --> 00:10:41,720
that would express you liking me.

225
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:44,720
That's a mouthful.

226
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:48,120
So, you really

227
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,639
don't like me?

228
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:50,960
I don't.
