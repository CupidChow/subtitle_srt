1
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,439
Come and catch me!

2
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:22,200
Stop right there!

3
00:01:23,799 --> 00:01:24,799
Come and get me!

4
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,319
I said stop!

5
00:01:28,519 --> 00:01:29,239
Give me the balloon.

6
00:01:29,319 --> 00:01:29,920
No, I won't.

7
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,560
Finally caught you!

8
00:01:34,599 --> 00:01:35,519
Give me the balloon.

9
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,480
No.

10
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,239
I won't.

11
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:02,920
That year,

12
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:05,000
someone tricked me into going to the amusement park.

13
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,239
Then he left with his friends.

14
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:09,039
He left me there all alone.

15
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:14,639
Just when I was at a loss,

16
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,120
I met a little girl.

17
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:19,759
She had also gotten separated from her mother.

18
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,120
Later, we were inside the Ferris wheel.

19
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:26,159
That day, we were so close to the sky.

20
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:27,840
And close to the clouds too.

21
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:29,719
Even now,

22
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:33,520
I still remember that girl's bright smile.

23
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:43,439
The moment the accident happened,

24
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,960
I opened my eyes and looked down.

25
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,360
That person was standing there.

26
00:02:56,479 --> 00:02:57,719
He was smiling at me.

27
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:01,960
It was as if he was mocking my foolishness and naivety.

28
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,400
It was at that very moment

29
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,759
that I knew for the first time

30
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:11,879
that even my own family

31
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,439
wished for my death.

32
00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:17,599
Family.

33
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:23,919
That person was my younger brother.

34
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:26,240
Lin Han.

35
00:03:36,439 --> 00:03:37,000
When I was little,

36
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,039
I was in poor health.

37
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:39,159
Very weak.

38
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,039
My parents thought my future

39
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,840
didn't hold much promise.

40
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,879
So they had another son, a younger brother for me.

41
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:48,120
He was a few years younger than me,

42
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:49,759
but very healthy.

43
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:53,719
A younger brother being stronger than his older brother

44
00:03:54,039 --> 00:03:55,680
For a child,

45
00:03:56,639 --> 00:03:57,560
is more terrifying

46
00:03:58,599 --> 00:03:59,639
than it is pitiful.

47
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,240
So, all of this...

48
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,000
He did all of this.

49
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:15,960
Alright, Meili.

50
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:18,519
Even though you already know everything,

51
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,439
I still want

52
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:20,720
to reintroduce myself.

53
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:22,279
My name is Lin Hai.

54
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:23,959
The 'Hai' from 'A vast and boundless sea'.

55
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,759
Little brother, what's your name?

56
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,759
My name is Lin Hai.

57
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,040
The 'Hai' from 'A vast and boundless sea'.

58
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,879
I have something to do today.

59
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:46,199
You'll have to play by yourself for now.

60
00:04:54,519 --> 00:04:55,399
I'm sorry.

61
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,000
The number you have dialed is currently...

62
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,680
A very compelling story.

63
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,399
Thanks for sharing.

64
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:07,360
What did you say?

65
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:09,519
I said,

66
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,120
your story is very compelling.

67
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,720
Thank you for being willing to tell me.

68
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,800
Meili.

69
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,600
Last time at the cafe,

70
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,480
you stood me up.

71
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,040
I waited for you all day.

72
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,839
You won't be such a killjoy today, will you?

73
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,160
I've already said

74
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,040
I know.

75
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,639
What else do you want me to say?

76
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,720
I'm the one

77
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,879
who was with you in the Ferris wheel,

78
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:31,319
the one who shared that hardship with you!

79
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,560
So what?

80
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,439
So I like you.

81
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,800
From the moment I saw you again,

82
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,720
I was certain.

83
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:39,519
We knew each other since childhood,

84
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:41,199
and then we met again.

85
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:43,120
Isn't this fate?

86
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,560
Let Lin Hai end here.

87
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:48,759
What?

88
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:51,680
The dutiful son who never calls his father first

89
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,240
actually starts with a command.

90
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,319
How truly rare.

91
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,199
It seems

92
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:56,160
our Lin family

93
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,319
must have hit some kind of jackpot.

94
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,839
I'm not joking.

95
00:06:00,439 --> 00:06:02,959
Otherwise, you'll lose both your sons at once.

96
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,160
It's about the sons again, isn't it?

97
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:12,439
Not to be rude, but

98
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:13,360
all these years,

99
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,480
that child

100
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,319
has truly suffered a great injustice.

101
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:18,160
Of course I know that.

102
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:19,759
But what can be done about it?

103
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,639
Yes.

104
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:23,680
They're both our children.

105
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:25,240
What can we do?

106
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:27,800
When they needed me,

107
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,639
I failed to take care of either one properly.

108
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,240
Honey, what are you doing?

109
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,480
This isn't your fault either.

110
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,720
Please, stop crying, okay?

111
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:38,319
I have enough of a headache already.

112
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,439
Are those your eyes,

113
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:42,639
or are they a fountain of tears?

114
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,480
If what flowed out

115
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,839
were pearls, that would be great.

116
00:06:45,879 --> 00:06:46,519
Our family

117
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:47,519
wouldn't need to run a company.

118
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:48,000
Right?

119
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,079
What kind of time is this

120
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:50,959
to be saying such things?

121
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:51,920
However,

122
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,759
this time,

123
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,879
what are the two brothers fighting about?

124
00:06:56,839 --> 00:06:58,399
It's the Qin family's daughter.

125
00:06:58,839 --> 00:07:00,920
She's Xiao Han's boss at work.

126
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:05,480
That girl.

127
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,519
But I don't like you.

128
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:18,519
It's Lin Han, right?

129
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,079
I've already told you,

130
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,319
he was the one who left me in the Ferris wheel.

131
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,040
After that, he was desperate to harm us.

132
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,199
And you know what?

133
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:27,560
He's been lying to you all along.

134
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,560
He's not a secretary at all.

135
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,240
He is...

136
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:33,040
How many more times

137
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,680
are you going to repeat this nonsense?

138
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:35,839
Secretary Lin.

139
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:36,800
What are you doing here?

140
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:38,000
Let's go.

141
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:40,839
You, stop right there!

142
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,040
I said, you stop right there!

143
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:00,720
You hit me.

144
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,879
I don't care who you are.

145
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:04,720
And I don't care who he is.

146
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:06,279
I only know

147
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:07,879
no one can touch my man.

148
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:09,319
Do you understand?

149
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,560
Meili.

150
00:08:11,079 --> 00:08:11,920
Meili.

151
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,360
Let's go.

152
00:08:15,399 --> 00:08:16,079
Meili.

153
00:08:16,839 --> 00:08:17,600
Qin Meili!

154
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,120
Does it still hurt?

155
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:14,200
Why did we come here?

156
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,320
Because, I don't know why, I had this urge...

157
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:19,679
something I absolutely had to do today.

158
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,000
Qin Meili.

159
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:21,960
Age: Thirty.

160
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:24,200
Current status: Single.

161
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,559
Romantic experience: Zero.

162
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,399
Favorite type of man: Gentle and considerate.

163
00:09:28,919 --> 00:09:29,919
The most unacceptable trait

164
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,440
is being as narcissistic as myself.

165
00:09:31,559 --> 00:09:32,639
The relationship I look forward to

166
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:33,759
is one of growing together

167
00:09:33,759 --> 00:09:34,679
and achieving success together.

168
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,600
The most heart-fluttering way to confess...

169
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:37,879
is at an amusement park.

170
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:39,519
The confession method I most want is...

171
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:40,200
What?

172
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:41,960
Where did you see that?

173
00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:43,240
On a dating app.

174
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:44,080
You didn't know?

175
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,279
A dating app.

176
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,240
I didn't know!

177
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:46,919
Let me see it.

178
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:48,679
Show me.

179
00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:51,480
I've been chatting with her for days.

180
00:09:51,639 --> 00:09:52,799
It's not you?

181
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,919
This isn't me!

182
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,639
Who am I?

183
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:03,600
You tell me who I am.

184
00:10:04,039 --> 00:10:05,080
I'm your mother.

185
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,320
Hello.

186
00:10:06,919 --> 00:10:08,480
I am Meili's mother.

187
00:10:10,679 --> 00:10:12,679
Because my daughter is older and unmarried,

188
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:15,240
I brought her online to find a husband.

189
00:10:16,679 --> 00:10:20,080
If any outstanding gentlemen are interested in my daughter,

190
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,399
Mom!
