1
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,400
My name is Zhang Shan.

2
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,680
I am 28 years old.

3
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,359
I graduated from Stanford University.

4
00:01:14,359 --> 00:01:15,200
Majoring in finance.

5
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,599
My specialty is...

6
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:17,640
Stanford University.

7
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:18,439
Right.

8
00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:20,239
Then explain...

9
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:21,799
the basic principles of the...

10
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:23,280
Black-Scholes option pricing model.

11
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,599
Brian what?

12
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,040
Graduated from the Chinese department.

13
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,200
Yes, President Qin.

14
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,280
I have worked as a secretary...

15
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,879
at several Fortune 500 companies.

16
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:45,000
I have extensive experience.

17
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,040
I have memorized the list of all...

18
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:49,120
past...

19
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:02,200
My specialty is being time-sensitive.

20
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:04,200
From the moment you entered the room...

21
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,200
how many seconds have passed?

22
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:10,479
Boss...

23
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,199
You forgot to have them take off their clothes.

24
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:13,120
I'll call them back now.

25
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,159
That won't be necessary, Secretary Lin.

26
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:16,000
None of them are qualified.

27
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:41,039
Careful!

28
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:42,400
Sit down.

29
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,360
I'll get an ice pack.

30
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,479
I've already booked you...

31
00:02:57,479 --> 00:02:58,560
an appointment with a specialist at a nearby hospital.

32
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,599
Please rest for a moment.

33
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:00,840
I've already asked Lao Wang to send a car...

34
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:02,319
to take you to the hospital shortly.

35
00:03:09,479 --> 00:03:10,120
President Qin...

36
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,319
Are you...

37
00:03:12,039 --> 00:03:13,240
unwilling for me to resign?

38
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,400
It seems Secretary Lin has truly...

39
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,439
learned the essence from me these past three years.

40
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:24,360
Very self-righteous.

41
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:26,680
I simply don't want...

42
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,599
after you leave...

43
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,319
my work to go undone, that's all.

44
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,120
Then why are you giving them such a hard time, President Qin?

45
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:37,879
President Qin...

46
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:41,360
Who's giving them a hard time?

47
00:03:42,039 --> 00:03:43,400
I'm not giving them a hard time.

48
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:44,919
Then are you giving *me* a hard time?

49
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,800
Let me say it again.

50
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,759
I am not giving anyone a hard time.

51
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:51,560
They genuinely are not qualified.

52
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,400
Then what are the full names...

53
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,080
of all the past Nobel Prize in Literature winners?

54
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,479
I'm afraid you don't even know them yourself.

55
00:03:57,639 --> 00:03:58,560
Sully Prudhomme.

56
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,719
Theodor Mommsen.

57
00:03:59,719 --> 00:04:00,840
Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson.

58
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:02,159
José Echegaray.

59
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,560
Frédéric Mistral.

60
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,759
Henryk Sienkiewicz.

61
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:05,960
Giosuè Carducci.

62
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,400
Rudyard Kipling.

63
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,159
Shall I continue?

64
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:25,639
Alright, boss.

65
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:26,839
I will continue to work hard...

66
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:28,079
to find you a new secretary.

67
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,600
But whether you accept it or not...

68
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,639
I will still resign one month from now.

69
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:38,240
Did you order the milk tea?

70
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,040
Yes.

71
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,399
Thank you.

72
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:41,240
Keep the change.

73
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:42,279
She's the one.

74
00:04:42,279 --> 00:04:43,639
My new secretary.

75
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:48,319
Within one month...

76
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,680
train her to be as capable as you.

77
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,519
But President Qin...

78
00:04:51,879 --> 00:04:53,199
She's not here for an interview.

79
00:04:53,319 --> 00:04:54,480
She's just from the milk tea shop downstairs...

80
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,279
delivering an order.

81
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:55,800
It doesn't matter.

82
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:56,920
I like her.

83
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:58,560
But she's a woman.

84
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:01,279
I think a male secretary is inconvenient.

85
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,879
The new secretary must be a woman.

86
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,360
Is there a problem?

87
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:05,600
No problem.

88
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:07,639
I'll get her up to speed as soon as possible.

89
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:09,040
You don't need to go to the hospital with me.

90
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:09,959
I'll go myself.

91
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:11,120
You take this...

92
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,040
Qin Xue...

93
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:13,759
Xiao Xue...

94
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,000
and get her familiar with the work.

95
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:18,720
Will this work?

96
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:22,759
Cici...

97
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,480
Sorry to trouble you, but please help me entertain her.

98
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,160
No problem.

99
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,639
Then Ms. Qin, please come with us over here.

100
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:28,439
Wait...

101
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,319
Who said I want to be a secretary?

102
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:07,279
Tonight, I'm going back to the Qin family home for dinner.

103
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,639
You're coming with me.

104
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,079
Yes, boss.

105
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,199
Let's go, Lao Wang.

106
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,480
Stop staring.

107
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,600
I finally made it back for a visit.

108
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,439
Let's eat.

109
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,560
What do you mean?

110
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:44,240
It's precisely because you're finally back...

111
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,360
that I want to look at you a bit more.

112
00:06:58,879 --> 00:06:59,759
How has the company been...

113
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:00,680
lately?

114
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,480
Very well.

115
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,439
Except for expanding into overseas markets...

116
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:08,680
some shareholders opposed it.

117
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,720
President Qin has already handled it.

118
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:12,000
Well done.

119
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,800
With you by her side...

120
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,920
I feel at ease.

121
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,680
Dad...

122
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:18,040
No talking during meals, no speaking before bed.

123
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:19,800
Look...

124
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,639
It might be a sprained ankle.

125
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:25,519
I'll go check.

126
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:26,879
Ah, no need.

127
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,959
You're finally here for a visit.

128
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:29,759
Eat more.

129
00:07:35,319 --> 00:07:36,000
Secretary Lin

130
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,319
You're twenty-eight this year, right?

131
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,079
Yes.

132
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:39,560
I'll be twenty-eight after the New Year.

133
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:42,560
What do you think of our Meili?

134
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:45,079
Young President Qin.

135
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,560
She's very intelligent.

136
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,720
And, as her name suggests,

137
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,560
she's also very beautiful.

138
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,800
One could say she's quite perfect.

139
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:51,839
Of course.

140
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:54,000
The daughter I raised,

141
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,000
has had half my life's effort poured into her.

142
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,480
So many people envy her.

143
00:07:57,959 --> 00:07:59,480
Both beautiful and capable,

144
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:00,720
and highly competent.

145
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:02,800
It's just that

146
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:03,920
she doesn't want to get married.

147
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,399
Secretary Lin doesn't seem to want to marry either, right?

148
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:08,959
You see,

149
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,639
neither of you wants to get married.

150
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:14,040
But Secretary Lin is outstanding.

151
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,399
If he were to marry,

152
00:08:15,399 --> 00:08:17,720
he'd have to find someone as perfect as our Meili.

153
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,160
What are you saying?

154
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,240
Nothing.

155
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:25,680
I just mean that

156
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,879
we're not unenlightened parents.

157
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:29,480
We never care about family background.

158
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:31,759
As long as he's good to our Meili,

159
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,240
you understand, right?

160
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:33,879
Secretary Lin.

161
00:08:33,879 --> 00:08:34,399
Yes?

162
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,600
Here, have some food.

163
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,080
Okay.

164
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:36,879
Eat a bit more.

165
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,240
My little princess.

166
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:43,200
Mom.

167
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:44,799
How have you been lately?

168
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:45,919
Smoothly.

169
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,679
At the company, I've basically already...

170
00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:50,639
I'm not talking about work.

171
00:08:51,879 --> 00:08:52,639
Your love life.

172
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,120
Is your love life going smoothly?

173
00:08:54,679 --> 00:08:55,440
Is it?

174
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,440
What love life?

175
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,799
I don't have any love life.

176
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,440
Look at you.

177
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:01,440
You won't accept blind dates,

178
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:02,840
so you should go out yourself

179
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,639
and explore the market more.

180
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,600
You meet so many people

181
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,799
in your work and daily life.

182
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:09,519
Is there not a single one you find pleasing?

183
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,080
If you really can't,

184
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,240
pay more attention to the people around you.

185
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:16,240
Right? For example...

186
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,399
For example...

187
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,639
That tall guy is so handsome.

188
00:09:21,639 --> 00:09:22,440
Mom!

189
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,600
I've already told you,

190
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,559
we're not people who look down on the poor and fawn on the rich.

191
00:09:25,559 --> 00:09:26,720
You don't necessarily have to find someone

192
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,799
from a matching social status.

193
00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:29,799
As long as you two are compatible

194
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,679
and he treats you well.

195
00:09:30,679 --> 00:09:31,799
Don't follow my example.

196
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,080
You're already thirty,

197
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,320
yet you're still acting like a child.

198
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:34,960
Mom!

199
00:09:35,639 --> 00:09:36,600
Twenty-nine!

200
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,840
Isn't that almost thirty?

201
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:39,759
And you're still not anxious?

202
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:40,240
Stop talking.

203
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:40,559
You're driving me crazy.

204
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:42,200
I'm really not interested in men.

205
00:09:43,039 --> 00:09:44,720
You're not interested in men?

206
00:09:45,639 --> 00:09:46,360
Then are you...

207
00:09:47,639 --> 00:09:48,720
Are you...

208
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,600
Mom, what are you thinking?!

209
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,480
How could that be?

210
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,120
Of course,

211
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,480
even if you were, it wouldn't matter.

212
00:09:55,639 --> 00:09:56,360
I've already said,

213
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,799
we're not unenlightened parents.

214
00:09:57,799 --> 00:09:58,480
Right?

215
00:09:59,080 --> 00:09:59,879
Really.

216
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:01,879
Mom...

217
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,360
Actually, I really do...

218
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:08,480
You...

219
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,480
You really like...

220
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,440
I'm teasing you, Mom!

221
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,279
How could that be?

222
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:18,480
My blood pressure just shot up.

223
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:20,200
Don't mess around with me like this.

224
00:10:23,159 --> 00:10:24,360
I hit your leg.

225
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,440
Don't try to scam me.

226
00:10:36,279 --> 00:10:37,120
Go on home, Mom, Dad.

227
00:10:38,039 --> 00:10:38,639
Goodbye.

228
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,360
That boy is really handsome.

229
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,039
The key point is,

230
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:51,000
he's also quite capable.

231
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,559
Secretary Lin, when are you getting married?

232
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,559
Because some unexpected things happened,

233
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:16,559
so I'm not getting married for now.

234
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,480
You got dumped, didn't you?

235
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,519
Boss.

236
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,480
That falls under my private affairs.

237
00:11:27,879 --> 00:11:28,600
It probably doesn't fall

238
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,080
under the category of things I need to report to you.

239
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:33,320
Well, since you're not getting married,

240
00:11:33,639 --> 00:11:34,759
why are you still resigning?

241
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,320
Because I want to start a new chapter in my life.

242
00:11:39,879 --> 00:11:41,039
A new chapter?

243
00:11:42,279 --> 00:11:43,679
So, being with me

244
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:44,840
counts as the old chapter?

245
00:11:55,879 --> 00:11:56,679
Secretary Lin.

246
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:00,759
Let's get married.
