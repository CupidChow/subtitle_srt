1
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,240
How could you do this?

2
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,720
You didn't tell me after you found out!

3
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,360
I said so many silly things unknowingly!

4
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,200
How could I tell you?

5
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,040
Ms. He wanted to hide it.

6
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,800
I couldn't just announce it, right?

7
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:26,800
Besides, I only found out a few days ago.

8
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,880
Like you,
I said a lot of silly things too.

9
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,360
This is ridiculous.

10
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,880
How can I, the Queen of Gossip,
miss out on such news?

11
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,640
This is too ridiculous.

12
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,480
Don't spread it.

13
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,680
I know.

14
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,600
What's going on between
Yuan Song and Ms. He now?

15
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,600
Not long ago,

16
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,080
Yuan Song still liked Ms. He.

17
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,160
Now,

18
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,000
I think they're really just friends.

19
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,400
Friendship between men and women?

20
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,600
There must be something going on.

21
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,080
What can there be?

22
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,560
Think about it.

23
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:07,040
If Yuan Song and Ye Luming both liked you,

24
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,240
who would you pick?

25
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,320
Me?

26
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,160
Are you feeling giddy?

27
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,080
In terms of dating,
I'd pick Yuan Song for sure!

28
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,600
As for marriage,

29
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,680
I'd pick Mr. Ye!

30
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:23,920
That's right.

31
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,480
Think about it.

32
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,400
Ms. He is already in her 30s.

33
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,440
No matter how you think about it,

34
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:32,400
she should choose Mr. Ye
for a better future.

35
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:37,280
Can't you live life in a more
capricious and reckless way?

36
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,400
A reckless life is only
for those with financial freedom.

37
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,080
Normal people like us

38
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,280
have to plan wisely.

39
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,880
After all,

40
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,680
life is like walking on thin ice.

41
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:56,920
It's tough to be human

42
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,680
and even more as a woman.

43
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,600
But being a 30-year-old unmarried woman

44
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,600
is even tougher.

45
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,400
-Drink up.
-Drink up.

46
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,680
Hey. Are we going to sing or not?

47
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:13,520
Of course!
I want to sing "Ten-Minute Romance!"

48
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,520
<i>A ten-minute romance</i>

49
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,839
<i>May be a little short</i>

50
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:23,240
<i>Your smile takes away all the regrets
I have in my heart</i>

51
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,160
<i>Class is over</i>

52
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,960
<i>A ten-minute romance</i>

53
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,840
<i>All of me belongs to you</i>

54
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:34,280
<i>I hope that we will never part</i>

55
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:35,960
<i>If you win,</i>

56
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,240
<i>I'll be your girlfriend.</i>

57
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,280
<i>How about that?</i>

58
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,560
You're way off. That's great!

59
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,400
Why are you so silent?

60
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,640
Are you still thinking about
how you missed the last shot?

61
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,320
No.

62
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,720
Then why do you seem so disappointed?

63
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:42,080
Aren't you happy working with Luo Wenyue?

64
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,920
Says who?

65
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,280
You.

66
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:48,240
Whatever she does, you follow her.

67
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,640
I do not!

68
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:57,000
You said that if I won, you would date me.

69
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,280
It was a joke, right?

70
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,480
Who would joke about that?

71
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,120
You could have just told me
you were kidding.

72
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,440
Then I wouldn't feel so bad.

73
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,200
Now I think I've ruined my life

74
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,960
with my own hands.

75
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,520
Never mind.

76
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,600
I should earn more money
and buy a house first.

77
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,000
Let me be clear.

78
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,600
Wishing to live
in a 200-square-meter house

79
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:31,760
is just a rumor.

80
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,920
I didn't say it.

81
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,760
It's not for you.

82
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,880
Don't be so full of yourself.

83
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,520
Say that again!

84
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,880
-You hit me?
-Say that again!

85
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,640
Can't I state the truth?

86
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,560
What's wrong? Did I hit your wound?

87
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,360
Let me see. Are you okay?

88
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,280
I'm sorry.

89
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,840
Today, I couldn't win.

90
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,320
Maybe, this is how our lives go.

91
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,560
We didn't win,

92
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,840
but we didn't come in last anyway.

93
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:36,840
Don't worry.

94
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:40,400
I will be more successful in the future.

95
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,200
Mrs. Chang told me that you have a switch.

96
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:03,840
It's true indeed.

97
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,560
Fine.

98
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,200
Since you looked cool
while you were bowling today,

99
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,080
I'll take that you've won.

100
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,760
You'll take that I've won?

101
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:17,760
What does that mean?

102
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,480
What do you mean by that?

103
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,360
What do you mean?

104
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:27,280
It means you look cool when you bowl.

105
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,720
What do you mean I look cool?

106
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,000
Do you want to have tea at my place?

107
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,600
Tea? At this hour?

108
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,760
YUAN SONG

109
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,880
YUAN SONG

110
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,480
Today's progress...

111
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,480
Amazing! You got a strike!

112
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,000
Yuan Song, eat up.

113
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:07,320
Thanks for teaching me how to bowl today.

114
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,120
He's a really good player.

115
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,240
Dad.

116
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,400
What are you doing here?

117
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,120
I...

118
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,600
I don't know.

119
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,400
Did you forget what you were doing?

120
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,280
Yes.

121
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,960
What was I trying to do?

122
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,360
It's late. Did you want to go
to the washroom?

123
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,640
Yes. I remember now.

124
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,960
The washroom.

125
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:59,040
-Washroom.
-Be careful.

126
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,120
You...

127
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,320
Why are you here?

128
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,640
Aren't you going to bed?

129
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:31,560
What's wrong?

130
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:35,880
Dad.

131
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:39,960
I'm sorry.

132
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,760
What are you saying?

133
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,040
Why are you sorry?

134
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,040
I'm sorry, Dad.

135
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,440
Don't cry, child.

136
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,240
I'm sorry.

137
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,840
I'm truly sorry.

138
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,840
What's wrong?

139
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,680
<i>In this world, I realized</i>

140
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:25,360
<i>that there are things that I can't do
no matter how hard I try.</i>

141
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,920
<i>There are things that I can't control
no matter how hard I try.</i>

142
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,560
<i>And there are things that I can't change</i>

143
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,040
<i>no matter how hard I try.</i>

144
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,480
<i>Let's meet tonight.</i>

145
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,800
-Slow down.
-Sorry, I got caught in traffic.

146
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,720
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

147
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,120
It's not a big deal.

148
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,160
Look. Tiantian is all good.

149
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,040
Are you really naming him Tiantian?

150
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:45,760
Tiantian is good!

151
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,200
It means being happy every day.

152
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,600
Why not name him Happy then?

153
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,560
Happy?

154
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,080
Happy is good too. I can do that.

155
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,240
No, Tiantian is better.

156
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,680
Tiantian, our Tiantian, little Tiantian.

157
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:03,680
He kicked me!

158
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,280
Are you crazy? He kicked you?

159
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,240
What are you going to do later?

160
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,600
I want to go shopping and have lunch.

161
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,520
Are you free? Join me.

162
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,520
Have you forgotten? I'm unemployed.

163
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:20,880
I have nothing but time to spare.

164
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,480
They sell dresses.

165
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,600
-This one's nice.
-It's fine.

166
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:28,800
Let's take a look.

167
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,200
Welcome!

168
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:33,520
It's nice.

169
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,480
I don't wear this kind of dress.

170
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,760
It suits you more.

171
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,560
Try a new style.

172
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,520
When your belly gets bigger,

173
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,880
wear it with a jacket and you're all set.

174
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:46,840
Buy it for me then.

175
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:54,440
Is this how you exploit
an unemployed middle-aged woman?

176
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:59,160
I'm about to raise a child alone.

177
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,520
I need to save up.

178
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,720
I really think that you should tell
Tiantian's dad about this.

179
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:14,160
After all, hiding things
and having others hide things from you,

180
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,720
both feel terrible.

181
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:21,320
If Dongyang knows that you call him
Tiantian's dad, he'd go crazy.

182
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,920
He really hates kids.

183
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:26,800
But you're right.

184
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,160
As the biological dad,
he has the right to know.

185
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:31,720
I'll consider it again.

186
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,280
I've been thinking.

187
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:40,120
It's always easier to make decisions on
other people's problems.

188
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,200
You may feel sympathetic

189
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:48,120
because you've had a similar experience,

190
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,080
but things like empathy

191
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:52,560
just doesn't exist.

192
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:54,840
Yes.

193
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,000
I've been reflecting on myself too.

194
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:01,200
When I was mediating relationships before,
did I speak as if I were God?

195
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,360
I spoke the facts.

196
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:07,120
Yes, onlookers see things more clearly.

197
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,600
As an onlooker,

198
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,400
I have to remind you.

199
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:17,280
They always say that
women in love are prettier.

200
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:18,520
Look at you.

201
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,360
If you put on a wedding dress,

202
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:23,240
you can be a real-life Corpse Bride.

203
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,560
Do I look that haggard?

204
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:32,800
Even though I don't have
the right to judge you,

205
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,760
I still want to remind you.

206
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,920
You should stop lying to yourself.

207
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,600
Love has always been

208
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,720
something that comes effortlessly.

209
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:47,440
What you need to work on
is keeping it and not let it slip away.

210
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,360
I just think

211
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:55,440
that many people have also dated
because they're compatible.

212
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,600
And they live a happy and loving life.

213
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,440
Well, I am also a normal person.

214
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,600
If they can do it, I can do it too.

215
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:03,640
You're wrong.

216
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:07,839
How can the same thing have
the same result on different people?

217
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:11,160
Everyone has different
principles and limits.

218
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:13,760
There is a saying that goes,

219
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:16,240
"Your personality decides your fate."

220
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:19,560
Yes, your personality decides your fate.

221
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:24,839
Before this, I thought I was so mature

222
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:28,000
to end the relationship
between me and Yuan Song.

223
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,680
We clashed like Mars and Earth.

224
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:32,560
I don't want him to derail from his path.

225
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:36,960
But now, when I see him with other girls,

226
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,920
I can't help but get jealous.

227
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,480
Since you know that you're jealous,

228
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,960
then I won't say anything else.

229
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,880
But if you still want to lie to yourself,

230
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,520
then do whatever you want.

231
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,120
Actually, I feel very sorry

232
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,600
towards Ye Luming.

233
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:59,680
I think Ye Luming
has probably noticed it too.

234
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,080
How can he not know
that your focus isn't on him?

235
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,520
He's also lying to himself.

236
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,000
Right now,

237
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,480
you're like a crow perching on a boar.

238
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,080
You can see others but not yourself.

239
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,760
Why are you attacking me?

240
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,400
I just don't want to see you
get any uglier.

241
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,520
Okay, I got it.

242
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:24,360
I'm already extremely ugly inside and out.

243
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,640
I can't get any uglier.

244
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:31,240
Even though I'm not sure
what I really want,

245
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:34,000
I know very well what I don't want.

246
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,400
You can do this.

247
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,680
That day,

248
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,800
I really shouldn't have

249
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,720
let Luming rest in Fanxing's room.

250
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,240
If that's the case,

251
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:05,080
then I shouldn't get this illness either.

252
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:08,400
What are you saying?

253
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,400
Who wants to be ill voluntarily?

254
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,720
You didn't have a choice.

255
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:14,880
That's enough.

256
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,680
Don't overthink.

257
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:21,000
Fanxing must have forgotten
about this already.

258
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,640
Other people don't need to worry

259
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,240
about their kids.

260
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,320
Look at our kids.

261
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,680
They hide everything from us.

262
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,520
They only tell us good things,

263
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,120
so that we won't worry.

264
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,400
That's why we have to keep trying

265
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,680
to figure things out by ourselves.

266
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:48,080
I feel so anxious.

267
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:51,360
That's enough. Stop feeling anxious.

268
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:54,280
The kids are all grown up.

269
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,920
There are many things

270
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,880
that we don't understand
and can't help with.

271
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,640
We will only trouble the kids more

272
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,040
in the future.

273
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,960
We won't be of much help.

274
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,240
Take me for an example.

275
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,640
I will only become more useless.

276
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,680
You're talking as if

277
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,680
you used to be helpful or something.

278
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,320
You always refute me.

279
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,680
-See?
-Fine.

280
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,400
I get it.

281
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:28,280
You're ill now.

282
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,480
In the future, I'll go wherever you go.

283
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:31,920
I won't let you get lost.

284
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:34,160
I'll ensure that
you will be taken care of.

285
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,720
It would be great

286
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,680
if humans

287
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,720
never grow old.

288
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:59,040
If we don't grow old and die,
we'd be like tortoises.

289
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,400
Looks like it will rain soon.

290
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,800
I'll shut the windows.

291
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,960
Hello? Where are you?

292
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,000
It will rain soon. I'll pick you up.

293
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,640
Sure, I'll wait for you. See you later.

294
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,960
I should have picked you up.
You're all wet now.

295
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:28,000
The weather forecast didn't say
it would rain.

296
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,240
I'll lend you Minmin's clothes. Come in.

297
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,560
What a feast.

298
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,120
Steven gave me this wine.

299
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,760
I couldn't bear to drink it.

300
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,160
Sit.

301
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,280
This is sumptuous.

302
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,520
This is nothing.

303
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:09,880
Your parents always invite me over
whenever they cook nice meals.

304
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:13,480
My parents' way

305
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,800
of showing their affection

306
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:19,200
is through food.

307
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,760
This language of love is very precise.

308
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,320
Every time I visit an elder's home,

309
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,840
I can't stop eating.

310
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,200
Have some.

311
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,000
Try the steak I made.

312
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,600
I've thought about it for a long time.

313
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:56,920
-We--
-Wait.

314
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,000
Can't you try the steak I made first?

315
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,080
He Fanxing.

316
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:13,800
Let's break up.

317
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:15,880
What?

318
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:19,640
Let's break up.

319
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,840
Let's go back to being friends.

320
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:25,400
I told you that I'd give you a month.

321
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:26,800
Forget about it.

322
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,120
Don't force yourself.

323
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,760
I can give myself a break too.

324
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:40,200
I'm sorry.

325
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,560
Why are you sorry?

326
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,560
I broke up with you.

327
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,320
I should apologize.

328
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,520
How can love be forced?

329
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,160
I was the one pushing it.

330
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,720
You're just the victim.

331
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,280
Thank you

332
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,000
for consoling me.

333
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:12,040
But you don't have
to make yourself the bad guy.

334
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,680
If I were a victim like you said,

335
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,920
I didn't lose anything either.

336
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,400
You helped me

337
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,440
and treated me well.

338
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,080
I helped you because I wanted to date you.

339
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:33,400
You shouldn't think too highly of someone

340
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:34,920
just because he was nice to you.

341
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:38,920
When a man is pursuing you,
it's normal for him to treat you well.

342
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,760
You're right.

343
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,600
But for someone to give so much in vain

344
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:50,680
yet I can't give him
the same amount in return,

345
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:53,960
it feels like I've dined and dashed.

346
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:58,600
Dined and dashed?

347
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,120
It's nice to dine and dash
once in a while.

348
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,360
Also, nothing was given in vain.

349
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,600
In the process of giving,

350
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:14,440
I felt good too.

351
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:23,400
Basically, it was just a give and take.

352
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,000
Okay.

353
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:31,680
I accept that.

354
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:34,600
Regardless,

355
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:37,440
thanks for dumping me.

356
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,560
You still had to be the bad guy
in the end.

357
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,040
You're so funny.

358
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:47,920
You're thanking me for dumping you?

359
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:54,040
Do you want to be nominated
for next year's Nobel Peace Prize?

360
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:03,960
Bottoms up for me.

361
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,280
Do as you please.

362
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,240
Drink slowly. That's expensive!

363
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:14,760
Drink slowly.

364
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,080
It's all inside.

365
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:49,440
Okay.

366
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,520
It's all inside.

367
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:44,240
Professor He, you're amazing!

368
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:47,720
With your method,
I reconciled with my uncle easily!

369
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:48,840
Did it go well for you too?

370
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:53,040
My mom changed the password.

371
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:54,440
I couldn't get in.

372
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:57,640
I see.

373
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:01,440
Why am I so unlucky?

374
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,040
That's true.

375
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:07,360
You and Fanxing share the same issue,
but not the same luck.

376
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:13,040
How did He Fanxing manage
to hide it so well?

377
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,960
There were no signs or hints at all.

378
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,400
Your sister didn't hide it well.

379
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,680
You all just thought
that she was very naive.

380
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:26,400
She doesn't look like
she would date her brother's student.

381
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:30,840
What did I just say?

382
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:35,080
You said He Fanxing looks too naive.

383
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,880
She doesn't look like
she would date Yuan Song.

384
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,400
But in reality,

385
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,280
I think Yuan Song made the first move.

386
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:48,720
You...

387
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:49,880
You knew?

388
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:51,400
Yes.

389
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,080
To put it simply,

390
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,600
my sister only dated your uncle
after she broke up

391
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,120
with the person you liked.

392
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:04,440
Our relationships are so complicated
that even dramas wouldn't have such plots.

393
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:10,440
I don't think we should care
about other people's problems.

394
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:11,560
Like how my uncle

395
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:14,880
didn't bother to find out
who Fanxing's ex was.

396
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:17,880
Otherwise, he would have felt
very awkward.

397
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:22,000
Do you have some misunderstandings

398
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:23,720
about your uncle's shamelessness?

399
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,480
What about him?

400
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:29,440
He already knew when He Fanxing
was dating Yuan Song.

401
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:31,640
What?

402
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:42,920
I think it's easier
to be friends with you.

403
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,640
It's more comfortable and carefree.

404
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:47,760
Tell me.

405
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:49,960
Love is not some bacteria.

406
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,280
How can it grow?

407
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:54,080
I've been so tired and anxious.

408
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:57,400
Every day, I repeatedly ask myself,

409
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,680
"Why do I not like you yet?

410
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:02,160
Why?

411
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:05,160
Could it be that
I have some sort of heart disease?"

412
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,920
Your heart is fine,

413
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,040
but your eyes aren't.

414
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:16,200
Lately, I also think

415
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:19,160
that I'm just like a beggar.

416
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:22,480
And you are a poor passerby.

417
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,880
You're the poor one. I'm not poor.

418
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,840
-You are poor!
-I'm not poor!

419
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:29,720
In my savings account, I have...

420
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:31,920
I have hundreds of thousands!

421
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
I'm not talking about money!

422
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:35,240
-What then?
-I'm talking about feelings!

423
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,560
I was too confident.

424
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:43,400
I thought you had them,
so I waited for you to give them to me.

425
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,040
Then I realized that you don't have them,

426
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:47,960
yet I kept waiting.

427
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:50,520
How pitiful.

428
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,240
I don't have them?

429
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,520
-You don't!
-I just...

430
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:56,200
If I had them, I'd give them all to you!

431
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:58,400
Then I started to ask myself.

432
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,520
Why am I making myself so miserable?

433
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:02,200
Ye Luming.

434
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:04,080
Do you really like her?

435
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:07,280
Or are you just refusing to accept defeat?

436
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:08,840
When there's a problem,

437
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:12,240
don't always blame yourself.

438
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:15,480
You can also find the answer
from someone else.

439
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,160
Right! You're so right.

440
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:20,040
-That's right.
-So I'm not the problem.

441
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:21,440
I'm so good.

442
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:24,000
Why would you like Steven's son?

443
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:26,240
Steven has ended his friendship with me.

444
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,160
He won't play pool with me anymore.

445
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,400
Steven!

446
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:35,840
Yuan Song is your best friend's son.

447
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,040
It's all your fault!

448
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,240
Fine. It's my fault.

449
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:40,320
Blame me, okay?

450
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,360
Let me tell you a secret.

451
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,640
It's going to be hard for you

452
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:50,080
to find another man

453
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:52,120
who is as good as I am.

454
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:55,160
You will surely regret this.

455
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,000
Regret?

456
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,520
You will surely regret this.

457
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,200
Steven's son isn't as good as me.

458
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,440
Nonsense!

459
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,520
He's better than you.

460
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:14,440
-He's nice too.
-Nonsense!

461
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,920
You're still defending that wild man?

462
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,840
Nonsense! You're the wild man!

463
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,080
-Nonsense!
-Nonsense!

464
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,040
-I'm not nonsense!
-What are you?

465
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,040
You're right.

466
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,400
I am nonsense. That's why you let me go.

467
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,640
Nonsense Ye Luming.

468
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,440
Nonsense He Fanxing.

469
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:40,600
Nonsense Ye Luming.

470
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,320
Nonsense Ye Luming.

471
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,480
Nonsense Ye Luming.

472
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:50,640
Nonsense He Fanxing.

473
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:51,600
Here.

474
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:56,480
Your niece!

475
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:59,880
I've met her! I know her!

476
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,600
Come.

477
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,160
Come.

478
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:10,760
This is my niece.

479
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:11,960
Isn't she cute?

480
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,000
You...

481
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,800
Of course you've met her, she...

482
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,360
She went to your house.

483
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,360
No.

484
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,199
It was Yuan Song's house.

485
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:29,080
She thought I was the housekeeper.

486
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:30,360
Like this.

487
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:36,480
Housekeeper? You more look like an alien.

488
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,800
They called me Ma'am.

489
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,880
I was so sad!

490
00:34:41,719 --> 00:34:42,920
Ma'am.

491
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:48,360
Why are you two drinking so much?

492
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:52,159
Put it down!

493
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,360
Kids can't drink!

494
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:56,920
Let me tell you a secret.

495
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,320
I dumped her.

496
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,600
What?

497
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:07,120
This is what happened.

498
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:10,760
I was going to break up with him.

499
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:14,120
But he brought it up first.

500
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:15,040
I won!

501
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:17,200
So I got dumped!

502
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:18,840
You got dumped.

503
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:21,520
But we are now best friends!

504
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:22,880
Best friends.

505
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:24,720
Nonsense Ye Luming!

506
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,440
Drink, Nonsense He Fanxing!

507
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:30,200
You're a mix of nonsense.

508
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,440
Hello?

509
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:42,280
Professor He, don't leave first.

510
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,840
Come to my house now.

511
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,480
What?

512
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:47,880
Are they drunk?

513
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,920
Okay, I'll come now.

514
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,880
Let me recap what happened.

515
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,400
Fanxing came to break up with my uncle,

516
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:05,160
but my uncle brought it up first
and dumped her.

517
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,960
They are now back to being friends
and had this breakup dinner.

518
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:10,120
Now, they're drunk.
Episode Two starts now.

519
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,040
I just feel

520
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:16,040
so sorry for my dad.

521
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:22,040
I know he really wants
to see me get married.

522
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:26,000
Every time I visit my grandma,

523
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:29,480
she asks him so many questions.

524
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,760
Do you know my second aunt?

525
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,920
Every time we meet, she would tell me

526
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:41,080
that I can't do whatever I want

527
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:43,120
and live as I please.

528
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:46,200
I have to think about
my parents' feelings.

529
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:49,000
Every time she says that,

530
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:51,040
I just feel

531
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,600
very sad.

532
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:57,120
-Very sad.
-I get it.

533
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,160
I get it.

534
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,600
It's hard for a woman.

535
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,480
If humans

536
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:10,200
all live the same way,

537
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:13,440
it would be boring, right?

538
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:16,280
I just want

539
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:19,760
to meet someone I like

540
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:21,960
and date him.

541
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:25,080
When we're stable,

542
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:27,280
we'll naturally get married.

543
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,720
When our marriage is stable,

544
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:32,840
we'll have a kid.

545
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:38,120
But even if I don't have these things,

546
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:41,080
it's fine too.

547
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:42,840
It's fine.

548
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:44,760
It's fine if I don't have them.

549
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,640
I wish I could live until I'm 200.

550
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,360
What? 200 years old?

551
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:59,000
That's nice.

552
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,600
Fanxing, let's go home.

553
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,520
Canyang.

554
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:06,840
My brother.

555
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:08,600
Let's go home.

556
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:10,160
Canyang.

557
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:15,120
Are you here to see his niece?

558
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:18,280
You know what?

559
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:22,360
Once, at Yuan Song's house,

560
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:25,920
she thought I was the housekeeper.

561
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,520
Apologize to her, Cai Minmin.

562
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,040
-Apologize to her.
-There's no need.

563
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:31,520
Cai Minmin!

564
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,000
There's no need.

565
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:34,440
Uncle, you're drunk.

566
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:36,040
I'll help you to your room.

567
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:39,480
No, I'm not done drinking yet.

568
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:41,520
Let's go home.

569
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:43,760
What's with your sister?

570
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,440
She can't forget her ex,
but she still dated my uncle.

571
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:48,040
Where are her morals?

572
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:50,200
What about my sister's morals?

573
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,960
Your uncle pursued her so closely
like a stalker.

574
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:55,400
How is my uncle like a stalker?

575
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:57,040
She could have called the cops on him.

576
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:00,720
So everything is her fault?
Doesn't it take two to tango?

577
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,520
You can't blame my uncle for everything!

578
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,200
You're doing the same thing
towards my sister!

579
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,200
Fanxing, let's go.

580
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,240
Where's your bag?

581
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:12,080
No.

582
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:15,200
I still want to play
with Nonsense Ye Luming.

583
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:18,360
-Let's go home.
-Nonsense He Fanxing, drink up.

584
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,320
-Nonsense He Fanxing.
-Nonsense Ye Luming.

585
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,240
Nonsense Ye Luming.

586
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,160
-Nonsense He Fanxing, drink up.
-Horse!

587
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:28,320
Horse, go!

588
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,480
Go!

589
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,120
Good morning, everyone!

590
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,400
Good morning?

591
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:04,600
You're late again. Come and help me pack.

592
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:06,440
Why are you so angry in the morning?

593
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:07,840
Chang Huan.

594
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:09,480
Why do you like her?

595
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:14,280
Can you be polite to your superior?

596
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:17,920
I'm sorry. I got a notice
from human resources.

597
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:19,800
I just got promoted!

598
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:22,840
I'll report to the headquarters
in two days.

599
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,400
I'll be the manager of Marketing Team Two!

600
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:29,560
Congratulations!

601
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:33,280
The previous manager of that team
was promoted to marketing director,

602
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:35,200
so there was a vacant position.

603
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:39,520
I'll count on you in the future,
Manager Cong.

604
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:40,920
Of course.

605
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:43,320
You are all my family and friends.

606
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:45,560
I will treat you well.

607
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:47,120
Thanks, Ms. Cong!

608
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:49,600
Hurry, help me pack.

609
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:51,440
Okay, Ms. Cong.

610
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:56,080
The marketing manager's salary

611
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,920
is affected by the department's
sales performance.

612
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:00,840
Chang Huan, you'll have to work
extra hard then.

613
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,480
Shut up.

614
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:03,760
How else can he work hard?

615
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:06,040
He's already working overtime every night.

616
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:07,120
What about his health?

617
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,800
Don't sleep late because
you think you're young.

618
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:14,920
Do you know how many people died
because they sleep late?

619
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:16,080
Didn't you see the news?

620
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:20,400
All right. I'll listen to you.

621
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:24,520
What a stench. The stench of love!

622
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:25,960
Say that again!

623
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:29,240
Yuan Song, your annual leave
has been approved.

624
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,160
Seven days.

625
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:32,280
Remember to bring us some souvenirs.

626
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:33,600
All right.

627
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,320
-Where are you going?
-Suzhou.

628
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:39,600
In two days, my favorite architect
is having a talk there.

629
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:40,880
I want to learn from him.

630
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:42,560
You're going alone?

631
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:45,040
I'm going with Luo Wenyue.
Both of us admire that architect.

632
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:50,720
No wonder you look so happy.

633
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:52,560
Don't misunderstand,

634
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,360
I don't like Luo Wenyue.

635
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:55,880
You don't like her,

636
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:58,320
but she likes you.

637
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:00,640
It's easy for girls to pursue guys.

638
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:03,280
You seem pretty happy now.

639
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:06,800
Not long ago, somebody looked
so depressed every day.

640
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:10,280
When Luo Wenyue appeared,
you got all perked up again.

641
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,160
Men always say one thing but mean another.

642
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:21,560
Young man, good luck.

643
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:24,200
What luck? I told you I don't like her.

644
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:26,920
Okay, you don't like her.

645
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:33,280
<i>The door is open.</i>

646
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:48,120
Is there no water at home?

647
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:51,720
Here.

648
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:53,560
I peeled a pomelo for you.

649
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:56,720
Eat it with sugar
to get rid of bad breath.

650
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:05,560
Look at the time.

651
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,640
It's 4:00 p.m., Fanxing.

652
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:10,760
Do you think it's fine
to get so drunk at night?

653
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:30,040
Don't be like this.

654
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:33,320
It feels like something
is about to happen.

655
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:34,320
It scares me.

656
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:40,240
-He Canyang.
-Yes?

657
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:43,640
Help me out.

658
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:46,720
If Mom passes out,

659
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:48,600
call the ambulance.

660
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:50,120
What?

661
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:53,120
