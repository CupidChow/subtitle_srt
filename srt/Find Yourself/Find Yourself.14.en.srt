1
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,800
-<i>Hello.</i>
-Hello.

2
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:08,960
I went to your shop yesterday
and returned a necklace.

3
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,880
<i>You must be Ms. He.</i>

4
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,360
Yes, that's right.

5
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,800
The necklace hasn't been sold yet, has it?

6
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,040
<i>Sorry, Ms. He.</i>

7
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,360
<i>It's been sold already.</i>

8
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,720
That quick?

9
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,360
<i>A customer previously asked us</i>

10
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,520
<i>to call her when the item is available.</i>

11
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,920
<i>So she came in the afternoon and took it.</i>

12
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,200
When will it be available again?

13
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,080
<i>It's really hard to say for this design.</i>

14
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,640
<i>It's out of stock everywhere.</i>

15
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,000
<i>That's why I asked</i>

16
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,560
<i>if you need to reconsider.</i>

17
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,080
<i>Perhaps,</i>

18
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,600
<i>you could come to our shop</i>

19
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,120
<i>and check out other designs?</i>

20
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,880
No, that's the one I want.

21
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,320
<i>You can leave your number then.</i>

22
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,520
<i>Once we have stock,</i>

23
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,680
<i>I'll give you a call.</i>

24
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:51,880
<i>Will that be okay?</i>

25
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,880
All right. That's the only thing I can do.

26
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,840
You're the one Fanxing mentioned?

27
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,440
The good friend

28
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,080
she met on a blind date?

29
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,840
Was that how He Fanxing introduced me?

30
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,480
No wonder Mrs. Wang
from downstairs said...

31
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:22,480
She thought you and Fanxing were a couple!

32
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,560
You...

33
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:29,840
Thank you.

34
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,840
Ye here already has someone he likes.

35
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,800
I have a long way to go.

36
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,200
She doesn't like me.

37
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,800
In relationships,

38
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:43,480
you can't force it
when the timing isn't right.

39
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,240
For example, look at Fanxing.

40
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,640
She's all right, isn't she?

41
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,440
Yet she's still single until now.

42
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,600
She's not just all right.

43
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,920
He Fanxing is great.

44
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,640
I haven't had a chance
to visit you before.

45
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,840
But I finally understand

46
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,040
after meeting you.

47
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,600
The reason why He Fanxing is great

48
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,040
is because of genetics.

49
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,120
Look at what a sweet talker Ye is.

50
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,080
Mrs. He.

51
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,200
Calling me Ye sounds too formal.

52
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,760
Just call me Luming.

53
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:16,880
Luming?

54
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,880
What a nice name.

55
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,000
Luming, you and Fanxing

56
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,520
are similar in age.

57
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,320
Our houses are close too.

58
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,200
Next time, if you have time,

59
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,680
feel free to drop by.

60
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,760
We'll prepare good food for you.

61
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,600
Since you offered,

62
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,600
I'll come here to eat more often.

63
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,920
I hope you won't find me annoying.

64
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,880
No, not at all.
We're more than happy to have you.

65
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,040
That's right.

66
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,440
Fanxing has never brought

67
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,840
any man home to introduce to us.

68
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:55,480
That's because she didn't want you
to set them up.

69
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,680
What are you saying?

70
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,800
Can't I worry about our kids?

71
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,320
Luming.

72
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,160
When a woman gets to a certain age,

73
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,720
she likes to do two things.

74
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,720
One is gossiping,

75
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,600
the other is matchmaking.

76
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:14,240
If someone's single,
she's more anxious than that person.

77
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,440
Are you complaining about me now?

78
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,560
You're already old.

79
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,960
Just play along.

80
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,840
Mrs. He, you're so funny.

81
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:27,960
Ye.

82
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,320
-I mean, Luming.
-Yes.

83
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,440
Well,

84
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,040
why don't you give me your number?

85
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:37,000
If I cook anything, I'll give you a call.

86
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,160
Sure.

87
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,080
I have two phones.

88
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,320
One's for work, one's for personal use.

89
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,680
I'll give you both.

90
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,800
Feel free to call me anytime.

91
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,280
Lovely.

92
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:50,280
Please enter the numbers for me.

93
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,400
No problem.

94
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,080
Mom, I'm home.

95
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,360
You're home.

96
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,000
You...

97
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,280
I'm telling you, someday,

98
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,360
when Fanxing brings her boyfriend home,

99
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,760
you'll scare him away.

100
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,000
What do you mean?

101
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,200
He helped out

102
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,480
and drove you home.

103
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,680
I asked Fanxing to see him off.

104
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,960
What's wrong with that?

105
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,440
Please.

106
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,400
We've been together for so long.

107
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,200
Do you think I don't know
what you're up to?

108
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,880
Luming likes someone else.

109
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,840
He and Fanxing are just good friends.

110
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,600
That's not a setback.

111
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,400
If they can be good friends,

112
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:55,280
it means they get along
and are fond of each other.

113
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,160
Who knows, after some time,

114
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,480
the friendship

115
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:02,120
might level up into love?

116
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,560
"Level up"?

117
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:09,240
Is friendship a level below love to you?

118
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,640
Are you trying to pick a fight?

119
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,520
Their friendship might

120
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,960
turn into love.

121
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,320
Okay?

122
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,760
-You--
-Fine.

123
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,240
I don't want to argue with you.

124
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,400
Let me ask you.

125
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,800
Would you approve

126
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:28,240
if Luming really becomes

127
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,920
Fanxing's boyfriend?

128
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,880
Luming is...

129
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,080
not bad.

130
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:37,800
Not bad.

131
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,280
That's all there is to it.

132
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,560
Why all the fuss?

133
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,520
You saw Baylor many times.

134
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,160
You still can't recognize him?

135
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,160
All Golden Retrievers look the same.

136
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,240
I wouldn't recognize Love Charm
if he's with other poodles either.

137
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,080
You're really his dad.

138
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,280
Are you saying

139
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,880
that I purposely approached Mr. He,

140
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,400
so I could find your house?

141
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,000
Isn't that your theory?

142
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:12,240
"There's a hidden agenda
behind every coincidence."

143
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,240
Say it!

144
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,200
You scumbag, what are you scheming?

145
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,320
I was so bold

146
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:24,240
because I wanted to win your heart!

147
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,160
Hence I took the risk!

148
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,040
What an actor.

149
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,080
I was just playing along.

150
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,960
Because you're so unforgiving.

151
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,679
You're still teasing me about the past.

152
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:36,919
Fine, forget it.

153
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,679
You might really
break into a song out here.

154
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:43,960
Mrs. He said that

155
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,840
you went shopping with colleagues.

156
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,160
You went on a date, right?

157
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,240
When you came in,
your face basically said, "depressed!"

158
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,360
Tell me.

159
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,800
Did you fight?

160
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,640
No date, no fight.

161
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,120
I just did the stupidest,

162
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,960
most unbelievable, and ridiculous thing

163
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,880
in the world.

164
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,600
What? What is it?

165
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,760
I want to know!

166
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,280
What a busybody.

167
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:15,840
I returned the necklace he gave me.

168
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,480
Then, I wanted to buy it back.

169
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,200
But it's no longer available.

170
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,400
Why did you return it?

171
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,640
You don't like it?

172
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,000
I do.

173
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,600
But it's too expensive.

174
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,000
Too expensive?

175
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,840
So, you wanted to...

176
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,800
Return it and give him back the money.

177
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,080
He Fanxing!

178
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,320
-What?
-My goodness!

179
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,320
Are you out of your mind?

180
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,840
He is only an intern.

181
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,960
That necklace costs over 4,000 yuan.

182
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,080
His salary is not even enough for himself.

183
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:52,360
Receiving the gift
gave me a lot of pressure!

184
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,000
So you wanted to return it
and give the money back to him.

185
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,280
I get that part.

186
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,600
But why buy it back?

187
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,840
I was thinking

188
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,320
about talking to him
when I return the money.

189
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,280
But then,

190
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,760
when I saw his face,

191
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,320
I couldn't say anything.

192
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,280
That makes perfect sense.

193
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,240
He happily bought a gift
for his girlfriend.

194
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,120
Who knew she'd return it

195
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,520
and give the money back?

196
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,520
She even said,

197
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,720
"You penniless kid!
Stop acting generously!"

198
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,120
I can clearly hear

199
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,760
a loud "whack" from his side.

200
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,760
What are you saying?

201
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,280
That's not my intention!
It's for his own good.

202
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,840
Do you think he would slap me over that?

203
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:37,880
No...

204
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,760
I was only imagining

205
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:43,200
your boyfriend's fragile little heart
being crushed by you.

206
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,280
Whack!

207
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,240
You scared me.

208
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,440
You're crazy.

209
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:55,520
Besides, your intention no longer matters.

210
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,440
A young man

211
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,520
naturally has a stronger pride.

212
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,080
You could've

213
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,440
paid him back without him knowing.

214
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,800
Why did you choose such a terrible method?

215
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,480
As a bystander, this is already

216
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,800
making me upset.

217
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,760
Let alone him.

218
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:14,920
Think about it.

219
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,160
His fragile heart

220
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,280
is constantly being...

221
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,440
Whack!

222
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,840
-Whack!
-That's enough!

223
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,400
I'm already regretting it!

224
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,800
If someone's willing
to sell the necklace to me,

225
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,000
I'm willing to pay double

226
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,800
or even triple.

227
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,480
I'm curious.

228
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,000
What does the necklace look like?

229
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,840
Is it as pretty as the one
I got for my goddess?

230
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:39,880
Of course.

231
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,640
It's...

232
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,320
It looks good.

233
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,880
It's a limited edition.

234
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,120
I have to wait.

235
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:58,920
Limited edition?

236
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,360
This is hunger marketing.

237
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:04,600
It's based on the perception
that scarcity connotes value.

238
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,800
Today, I actually gave a similar example

239
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,400
at a staff training session.

240
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,960
If we consider love

241
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,680
as an intangible commodity,

242
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,000
then it is also being used

243
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,640
as hunger marketing since the beginning.

244
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:18,920
Think about it.

245
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,840
We provide limited choices

246
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,120
targeted at a sole customer.

247
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,480
Also, it is possible for other people
to grab them anytime.

248
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,120
This creates a feeling of urgency.

249
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,000
It reminds every consumer

250
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,320
to grab something quickly if they like it.

251
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,440
Are you trying to say

252
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,120
that love is some sort
of impulsive buying?

253
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,680
And unfortunately,

254
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,440
people often buy the wrong thing.

255
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,600
Forget it.

256
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,080
This is too depressing.

257
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,480
Enough about me.

258
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,200
Let's talk about you.

259
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,360
After giving her the necklace,

260
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,360
was there any progress with her?

261
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,080
Of course.

262
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,280
How are you guys doing now?

263
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:17,920
What's the matter?

264
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,920
-You...
-What is it?

265
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,240
Why aren't you wearing
the necklace I gave you?

266
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,400
Don't tell me you returned it.

267
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,680
Or you don't like it?

268
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:29,800
No way.

269
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,600
I like it. Of course, I do.

270
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,560
But...

271
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,960
<i>I lost it.</i>

272
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,480
I can't return it without the receipt
even if I wanted to.

273
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,320
Can you give me the receipt?

274
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,400
In your dreams.

275
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:53,960
Don't change the subject.

276
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:56,480
Tell me.

277
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:00,160
Were you ruthlessly rejected,
so you're not willing to tell me?

278
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,440
Being aware without exposing things,

279
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,480
that's what friends do.

280
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:06,880
It's that bad?

281
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,440
The other couples are all lovey-dovey.

282
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,600
A backup like me is standing before her,

283
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,120
but she doesn't notice me.

284
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,800
I'm starting to wonder
if I am unattractive.

285
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,240
Why isn't she attracted

286
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,840
no matter what I do?

287
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,880
You're not unattractive.

288
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,680
Let me dissect it for you.

289
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,800
Right now, your goddess

290
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:36,440
only has eyes

291
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,960
for her boyfriend.

292
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,800
"There are millions of people,

293
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,560
but I only have eyes for you."

294
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,160
Do you know why is that so?

295
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,000
Are you saying that he's her true love
and I should give up?

296
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,960
No, that's not what I mean.

297
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,480
It's because there's only space
for one man in her eyes.

298
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,880
From that perspective,

299
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:00,240
that girl is pretty commendable.

300
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,240
At least,

301
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,360
she doesn't treat you like a backup.

302
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:07,600
I mean, she could always
keep you hanging around

303
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,040
until the time comes.

304
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,560
So when will she be done with him?

305
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,200
I'm a very nice backup!

306
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,360
But a backup is not always needed.

307
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,360
She might be contented
with what she already has.

308
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:43,040
A STUDENT AS MISTRESS, PICKED UP
BY LUXURY CAR ON FRIDAY AND SUNDAY

309
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,400
IMPRESSIVE. SHAME ON YOU.

310
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,520
HE SEEMS RICH. THAT'S A NICE CAR.
WHICH CLASS IS SHE?

311
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
What's up? High on ecstasy?

312
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,720
I'm not expecting any praise,

313
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,360
but can't you at least be nice?

314
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,800
There's a post on the forum,

315
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
saying a student of mine
has a sugar daddy,

316
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,760
with a luxury car driving her around.

317
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,120
Look.

318
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:15,080
Isn't she the star of my class,
Cai Minmin?

319
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,520
What a disgrace.

320
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,640
You're being harsh.

321
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,400
Maybe she's in love.

322
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,320
I'm saying that the anonymous poster

323
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,880
has foul intentions.

324
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,680
Who are they to judge?

325
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,240
That's right.

326
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,640
We're all adults here.

327
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:36,000
It's normal to date working adults.

328
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:41,480
<i>Hardworking lady,
you've filled up my fridge and house.</i>

329
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:44,920
<i>I can't repay you.
Please let me give myself to you again.</i>

330
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,240
YUAN SONG

331
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,720
What if it's the other way round?

332
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,960
The working adult is a woman

333
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,280
and the student is a guy,

334
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,400
and there's a big age gap.

335
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:01,760
That's what happened
to our neighbor, Wang Jiacheng.

336
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,360
The whole neighborhood knew.

337
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,520
Until now, Fang Shanshan
is still a legend.

338
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,720
They were passionately in love,

339
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,000
but Mrs. Wang was so pissed
that she wanted to die.

340
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:11,079
Hence,

341
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:13,520
while dating is a private matter,

342
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:16,280
they should consider
if their families can handle it.

343
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:17,520
Figure it out slowly.

344
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:21,240
<i>No wonder He Fanxing
isn't willing to tell us.</i>

345
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,119
Also,

346
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:25,920
men are really unreliable

347
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,760
in these situations.

348
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,920
Ultimately, Wang Jiacheng

349
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:32,320
married another woman and had twins.

350
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,120
But I personally think

351
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,520
that Fang Shanshan

352
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,560
didn't think it would last forever.

353
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,720
Just enjoy the relationship.

354
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,400
Break up if it doesn't work out.

355
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,640
Both sides are happy.

356
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,320
Why make a big deal out of it?

357
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,600
Don't you agree?

358
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:49,960
Forget it.

359
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:52,280
I won't be bothered by it. Just let it be.

360
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,000
Let what be?

361
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,040
Nothing.

362
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:00,360
I'll call the forum admin
to delete the post.

363
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,560
"See You 520"?

364
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:05,840
What's that?

365
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,600
On May 20,

366
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,360
on the sixth floor of Peninsula Hotel,

367
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,200
there will be a big-scale
blind date event.

368
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,800
It's very high-end.

369
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,600
The participation fee is 6,666 yuan.

370
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,240
It's that expensive?

371
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,840
Women get 25 percent off.

372
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,520
25 percent?

373
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:25,840
It's 4,999 yuan.

374
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,160
Without the decimals.

375
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:32,440
Ms. He, your calculating skill is superb.

376
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,680
It's too expensive.

377
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,480
It's so easy to earn
single people's money.

378
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,800
Our country is trying to improve its GDP.

379
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,840
First, the soaring property prices.

380
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,720
Then, there's the mismatched income.

381
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,760
Nowadays, single men and women

382
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,880
are doing whatever it takes
to find the best match.

383
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:48,480
Imagine this.

384
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:51,000
If the home shopping channel
is selling your mate

385
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:54,800
for only 4,999 yuan per person.

386
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,160
Buy.

387
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,480
-Buy.
-Buy and buy!

388
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:10,840
That's why if Bai manages
to find a boyfriend at the event,

389
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,920
it's like spending 4,999 yuan

390
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,360
to bring her man home.

391
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,600
Yes!

392
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,040
After hearing what Cong Xiao said,

393
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,400
I now see how it's worth every penny.

394
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:22,120
-Yes!
-There's nothing Cong Xiao can't sell.

395
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,400
Of course.

396
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,120
But I still prefer working in our company.

397
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:30,360
A small company
has a better atmosphere and benefits.

398
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:31,760
It's more humane.

399
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,800
My classmate works at a big company,
the stress is overwhelming.

400
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:37,560
She constantly worries about getting fired
due to poor performance.

401
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,120
They're always working overtime.

402
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,720
She's got white hair now.

403
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:45,240
I think that our company staff
are way up there in contentment too.

404
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:48,080
The only thing missing is a husband.

405
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:50,160
It's a shame the company
won't give me one.

406
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,160
If only I had a boyfriend.

407
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:56,680
I'd get flowers
even if Valentine's is pointless.

408
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:10,720
HONG SHENG HUI

409
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:12,000
You know some nice spots.

410
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,680
Enjoying the view?

411
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,600
Here.

412
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:21,840
I know I should leave
personal matters after work.

413
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,320
But I can't wait till then.

414
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,720
Go on.

415
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,960
May 20 is around the corner.

416
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,520
You didn't buy me a gift, right?

417
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:32,600
I did.

418
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:34,880
Or is there something that you want?

419
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,520
No, that's not what I meant.

420
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,840
What I'm trying to say is

421
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,760
that you're 22 this year.

422
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,760
You'll start working.

423
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,920
This is an important phase for you
to start being self-reliant.

424
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,680
And you guys

425
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:53,480
are in an era where income
is not at par with real estate prices.

426
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:55,920
So,

427
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,040
it's to be expected

428
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,400
that your financial ability is

429
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,400
not as strong right now.

430
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:09,520
If you are dating a girl in 20s,

431
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,840
even eating at a roadside stall

432
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,360
would be a happy date.

433
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,240
She'll be like a little bee,

434
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,520
buzzing around you.

435
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,440
A simple and sweet love.

436
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,960
Even if you don't buy her
an expensive necklace,

437
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,480
she'll still think

438
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:28,960
that you're the best
and look up to you unconditionally.

439
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:31,080
You're beating around the bush.

440
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,960
I'm really not sure
what you're trying to say.

441
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:40,720
What I actually want to say is

442
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:45,480
you'll eventually have
what those mature men have.

443
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:46,880
And I believe

444
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,920
that you'll have even more.

445
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,480
So,

446
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,680
there's no need to rush

447
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,160
to buy me things

448
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:59,280
that are beyond your capability right now.

449
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,080
The best thing

450
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,520
about having an older girlfriend
is her financial stability.

451
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,640
I can buy anything I want myself.

452
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:07,960
I don't need to rely on you.

453
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:09,840
Besides,

454
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,200
the only thing I don't have is

455
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:14,440
a limited edition item money can't buy,

456
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:16,920
which you already gave me.

457
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,480
That's the best gift.

458
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,120
Don't worry.

459
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:28,600
I won't force my ideas onto you.

460
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,000
Take your time.

461
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,160
No need to rush.

462
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:36,960
What's the matter?

463
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:41,280
Did I say something wrong
and make you feel bad?

464
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,120
I'm sorry.

465
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:49,960
I didn't mean any harm.

466
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,440
No.

467
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,320
What you said

468
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:01,760
reminded me of my mom.

469
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:03,640
<i>Mom?</i>

470
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,800
I'm touched that you care for me.

471
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:09,760
But don't worry.

472
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,920
I won't buy anything beyond my means.

473
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,480
Right now,

474
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,120
everything I buy is within my means.

475
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,720
The coming May 20

476
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,640
will be the first festival
we celebrate as a couple.

477
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:20,760
I already know what to get you.

478
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:22,960
There's no need.

479
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,520
You really don't have to buy me any gifts.

480
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,080
Rest assured.

481
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,200
You'll definitely like this gift.

482
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:30,800
I already love the necklace.

483
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,160
Wear it for me tomorrow then.

484
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,040
Tomorrow?

485
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:40,960
Okay.

486
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,680
I'll wear it tomorrow.

487
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:52,160
Careful, Mrs. He. It's falling off.

488
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:55,880
Chew slowly.

489
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:57,520
Mom, I'm home.

490
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,120
You're back, Canyang.

491
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,800
Have you had dinner?

492
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:01,840
Yes.

493
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:06,600
Listen.

494
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:08,720
Why are you here again?

495
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:09,960
Why can't I be here?

496
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,200
I brought Peanut.

497
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,960
-Where's Dad?
-Mr. He went boxing.

498
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,880
How is Xiaoyu's mother-in-law?

499
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,560
She's still in the hospital,
but she's fine.

500
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,760
So Peanut will stay here for now.

501
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,560
Our poor little Peanut.

502
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:28,520
You're getting kicked
from place to place like football.

503
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,160
Canyang!

504
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,200
Get lost.

505
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,520
Why are you saying that
in front of a child?

506
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,080
Come here, Peanut. Come to Grandma He.

507
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,760
-Try this. It's yummy.
-Where's Fanxing?

508
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,240
In the bathroom.

509
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,560
Finally, there are three people.

510
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,720
How about we play <i>Fighting the Landlord</i>?

511
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,280
Let's do it.

512
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,440
You think I'm scared of you?

513
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,080
Call.

514
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,440
Three Ks with a pair of twos.
You can't take that, right?

515
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,640
Because I also have a pair of aces.

516
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,400
I know you can't take it because
Professor Song threw a two earlier.

517
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:07,760
Joker!

518
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,360
I'm so sorry, but I have seven to Q.

519
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,160
Give me the money.

520
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,240
That's crazy!

521
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:16,920
How can you get three Ks
and a pair of twos?

522
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,720
That's right. Did she cheat?

523
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,120
<i>Fighting the Landlord</i> is so easy.

524
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,640
I always get to be the landlord
and I always win.

525
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:27,360
I feel bad for taking your money.

526
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,520
Let's play a different game.

527
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,360
<i>Stickers</i>?

528
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,280
How arrogant.

529
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:37,080
<i>Stickers</i> it is!

530
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:40,160
Fine. We'll play <i>Stickers</i> with you.

531
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,600
Get her.

532
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:44,000
Get her good.

533
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,320
Hey, look at the camera.

534
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,440
Lift your head up, quick.

535
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,640
Three, two, one.

536
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,360
Cheese!

537
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,400
I'll send it to Xiaoyu.

538
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:00,600
Why does she always get the good cards?

539
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,720
She memorized the cards.

540
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,080
She memorized the cards
during <i>Fighting the Landlord</i>!

541
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:08,080
I didn't do it on purpose!

542
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,040
I only

543
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:13,200
kind of remembered it subconsciously.

544
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,520
It wasn't difficult.

545
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,080
I'll kill you, He Fanxing!

546
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:19,000
Don't mind Professor Song, for my sake.

547
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,240
Let it go.

548
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,800
DONGYA

549
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,280
Is it your girlfriend?

550
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,120
I already told her I wanted to break up.

551
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,080
So she's my future ex-girlfriend.

552
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,480
-What's the reason?
-I couldn't forget my ex.

553
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:44,760
You're the worst.

554
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,240
You better answer her call.

555
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:49,720
Lying and evading her
won't solve anything.

556
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,080
It's not right to lie.

557
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,520
However,

558
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,440
using your ex as a reason

559
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,960
is considered a white lie, I guess.

560
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:02,040
A lie is still a lie.

561
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,040
Is a white lie not a lie?

562
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:08,240
Sometimes, a lie is like quenching thirst
with poison.

563
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:13,680
<i>"Quenching thirst with poison."</i>

564
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:30,080
<i>The moon hangs high up in the sky</i>

565
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,720
<i>Crescent-shaped like your eyebrows</i>

566
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:37,880
<i>My heart misses you</i>

567
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:40,960
<i>I can only move forward
There's no turning back</i>

568
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:43,240
<i>Oh, my love</i>

569
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,840
Why are you still here?

570
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:49,480
Mr. Ye.

571
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:51,800
Can I borrow my cousin for five minutes?

572
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,200
Okay.

573
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,880
Luming, you don't have to act like this.

574
00:27:58,600 --> 00:27:59,680
Like what?

575
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,120
You're my boss after all.

576
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,800
I'll explain it to your sister.

577
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:04,880
What do you mean?

578
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,520
Your relationship isn't going well, right?

579
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,880
There's no need to sing
"Blooming Flowers in the Full Moon."

580
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,320
Just let go if you fail.

581
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:15,360
It's painful
to see you pretending like this.

582
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:18,400
What do you mean I'm pretending?

583
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,800
I never fight a war I can't win.

584
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,160
Step by step, you know?

585
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:28,600
Conquering her is all a matter of time.

586
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:33,520
Okay, think of it
as my unnecessary concern.

587
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:34,920
Work awaits.

588
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:37,720
Stop.

589
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,400
Anything else, Mr. Ye?

590
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,920
It seems like if I don't show my stuff,

591
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:54,000
you wouldn't know what a true master is.

592
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,360
Listen.

593
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:00,520
I'm going to give her a call right now

594
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,920
and she's going to submit herself to me
like a servant.

595
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,440
Morning, Ms. He.

596
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,120
There's a package for you.

597
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:14,720
Thanks.

598
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:20,480
-Morning, Ms. He.
-Morning.

599
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,240
Yuan Song.

600
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,720
Come see me in my office.

601
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,720
HE FANXING

602
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:47,360
<i>Hello. The number you have dialed is busy.</i>

603
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,920
<i>Please try again later.</i>

604
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,000
<i>Hello. The number you--</i>

605
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,400
She could've pressed the wrong button.

606
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,200
One more time.

607
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,200
Sit.

608
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,680
It's connected.

609
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:20,920
Hello.

610
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,680
There's no need to thank me.

611
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:25,600
I'm offering you a rare opportunity.

612
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,000
You have the honor of buying me a meal.

613
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,200
<i>Let me be clear.</i>

614
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:30,800
<i>It can't be too cheap.</i>

615
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:32,440
I think

616
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:33,600
we should...

617
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:43,200
Mr. Ye, I'll go back to work.

618
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,520
Su Li, she...

619
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:49,440
Her phone probably died. Su Li, well...

620
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,120
She...

621
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:55,280
Crazy guy.

622
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,360
What's wrong?

623
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,240
Well...

624
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:13,280
I went to your house last week
and cleaned it up for you, right?

625
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,120
I saw

626
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,320
a box on the shoe rack

627
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:20,840
filled with receipts.

628
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:24,840
And so...

629
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:26,560
I GOT YOUR NECKLACE.

630
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:34,560
Don't you think the box needs a lid?

631
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:40,440
I mean, you see it
once you enter the house.

632
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:42,560
It looks untidy.

633
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:44,240
If there's a lid,

634
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,040
it would look tidier.

635
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,680
Do you have OCD?

636
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:55,160
A little bit.

637
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,080
Okay.

638
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,840
You sure that's all?

639
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,720
That's all.

640
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,400
You can go back to work.

641
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:14,440
Are you trying to trick me?

642
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:16,360
Not at all.

643
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,640
Oh my goodness!

644
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:40,280
He's got to be an angel!

645
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,560
Such timely help!

646
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:45,280
<i>I got your necklace.</i>

647
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,880
<i>I saved your life. How will you thank me?</i>

648
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:50,600
<i>I'm offering you a rare opportunity.</i>

649
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:52,480
<i>You have the honor of buying me a meal.</i>

650
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,520
-That's all. Thank you.
-Sure thing.

651
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:10,160
TRANSFER 4,200 YUAN TO YE LUMING

652
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:23,840
Only 4,200 yuan?

653
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,960
Isn't the necklace 4,200 yuan?

654
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:31,760
Did you buy it at a higher price?

655
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,520
How much is it then?

656
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,480
I bought it for 4,200 yuan.

657
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,280
But you said,

658
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:40,280
you'd pay three times the price
if someone could find it.

659
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,600
So now you owe me 12,600 yuan.

660
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,680
You're reselling it to me at 12,600 yuan?

661
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,360
-Are you a profiteer?
-Will you pay or not?

662
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:50,680
Never.

663
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,680
You have no shame.

664
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:57,720
You made me realize

665
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:00,600
that I need to be careful
in choosing friends.

666
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:02,520
I might lose everything I have

667
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,120
if I'm not careful.

668
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:09,239
I'm the one you're summoning
and dismissed at will.

669
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:12,239
I, Ye Luming, don't smoke nor drink.

670
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,120
A good man with no bad habits.

671
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:17,239
Why am I being rebuffed
when all I did was help?

672
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:20,480
I didn't mean to do that.

673
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,159
I'm almost begging
for forgiveness already.

674
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:26,560
Why do I feel like
I'm coaxing my girlfriend?

675
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:30,120
Drink up!

676
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,760
All right. Don't be angry.

677
00:34:41,239 --> 00:34:42,320
Will you do it again?

678
00:34:43,639 --> 00:34:45,560
No, I wouldn't dare.

679
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:06,200
Never mind.

680
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,280
The post was deleted.

681
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,600
I know I'm innocent.

682
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:17,960
Don't mention it. Many people reposted it.

683
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:23,680
Sorry about that.

684
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:24,920
She can be quite strong.

685
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,240
Zhao Linlin, you go ahead.

686
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:31,640
Go.

687
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:33,320
We still need to shower before lights out.

688
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,440
Melon.

689
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,640
What's this smell in your room?

690
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,200
Why does it smell so bad?

691
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:44,560
Why does it stink so much?

692
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,200
It's bad breath.

693
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,480
Don't you smell it?

694
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,160
I heard

695
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,400
that people who talk nonsense and gossip

696
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,480
tend to have bad breath!

697
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,480
That's not all.

698
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:57,680
Afterward,

699
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,560
their mouths would foam
with yellow fluid and rot away.

700
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:03,240
Then, it would stink even more!

701
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:04,600
Liu Zhanni.

702
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:06,280
Stop making oblique accusations.

703
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:07,800
My goodness.

704
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,720
A stench from a septic tank.

705
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:12,120
It's all over the school's forum.

706
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:13,680
The photos tell everything.

707
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,280
Everyone has seen it.

708
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,080
It's fine if you won't admit to it.

709
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:19,280
-That's right.
-But you can't say we made it up.

710
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:22,480
Yes, if you dared to do it,
can't we say it?

711
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,120
You know if you're making it up or not.

712
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:26,240
The whole school is talking about it.

713
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,880
Just call the police!

714
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:30,000
Stop acting tough in front of us.

715
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:33,000
We're not close with Cai Minmin.

716
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:35,160
Sure.

717
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:36,920
You're not close with Cai Minmin,

718
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,720
but you're close
with her skincare products.

719
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:43,240
Your parents worked hard
to send you guys here.

720
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:45,320
I bet they didn't make you live poorly.

721
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,440
Thief!

722
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:49,360
That's enough.

723
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:52,440
Stop it. You need to go.

724
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:53,760
A little forbearance brings peace.

725
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,840
-Just endure it.
-Did I say anything wrong?

726
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,760
Thief! You're a thief!

727
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,400
Who's a thief?

728
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:01,000
-I'm telling you...
-You, it's you. Thief!

729
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:02,200
You're the thief!

730
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:04,520
-You!
-Sharing things isn't stealing.

731
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,080
Are you any better?

732
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:08,800
All you do is suck up to Cai Minmin
like a lap dog.

733
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:11,160
You want her
to introduce you to a rich man,

734
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:12,640
so you could get a house!

735
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:29,960
-Say that again, I dare you!
-Melon!

736
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,040
-Stop fighting!
-Melon!

737
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:32,880
-Melon!
-Say that again!

738
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,080
-Say it!
-Melon!

739
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:35,160
Never mind.

740
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:36,400
Never mind, Melon.

741
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,560
Stop fighting.

742
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,600
Have you had breakfast?

743
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:16,880
I know.

744
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:20,400
Not even the dorm manager
could stop the fight.

745
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,840
If it was me, I wouldn't show up either.

746
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:26,920
Tell me.

747
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,120
Who started this?

748
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:29,880
She did.

749
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,240
It was self-defense on my part!

750
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:32,640
She deserved it!

751
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:36,400
School rules state that those involved
in serious fights will be expelled!

752
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:39,800
She posted a rumor
and then argued with my friend!

753
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:41,120
She deserved it!

754
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:51,960
Are you done?

755
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:55,440
Cai Minmin.

756
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:58,080
Li Jing said you started the fight.

757
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,440
Do you admit it?

758
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:02,520
Li Jing.

759
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:05,560
Cai Minmin said you posted
the rumor online

760
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:07,040
and argued with her friend.

761
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:08,240
Do you admit it?

762
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,280
No.

763
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:12,240
She accused me without any proof.

764
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:14,800
I argued with Liu Zhanni
because she started it first.

765
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,080
It was self-defense.

766
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,440
Cai Minmin.

767
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,600
You said she spread the rumor.

768
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:22,880
Do you have proof?

769
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:35,760
Professor He!

770
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,080
Bad news!

771
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:40,600
Your ex-lover, Professor Song,
is about to send your goddess, Minmin,

772
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:42,600
to the disciplinarian's office
for punishment.

773
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,960
If you have no proof,

774
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:47,680
then accusing someone else

775
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,240
is spreading a rumor yourself.

776
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,160
Li Jing.

777
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,440
You're Cai Minmin's roommate.

778
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:56,480
Conflicts are inevitable.

779
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,480
She most likely just acted on impulse.

780
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:01,720
Since she started it,
I'll make her apologize to you.

781
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:03,880
I won't apologize! I wasn't wrong!

782
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:10,680
Cai Minmin,

783
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:13,520
you fought in the dorm,
but you weren't wrong?

784
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:15,840
I originally thought

785
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,680
that we are roommates.

786
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,080
So it's fine if she just apologizes

787
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:20,760
and pays for the medical expenses.

788
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:23,240
But Cai Minmin doesn't think she's wrong.

789
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,840
I'm requesting the school to punish her!

790
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:27,080
Whatever!

791
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:28,720
I don't care if I get expelled!

792
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,800
I'll report you guys to the police!

793
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:32,120
You and Sun Yu!

794
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:34,760
You used my skincare products for a year
without permission!

795
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:36,120
Zhao Linlin is the witness!

796
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:37,680
You guys spread the rumor!

797
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:40,440
You were the only ones in the dorm
when the renovation company called me.

798
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:42,320
My uncle bought the house for me!

799
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,640
We'll get a DNA test.

800
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:45,920
You guys started the rumor!

801
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:46,840
Cai Minmin.

802
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:49,400
You don't own the police.
Where's the proof?

803
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:50,440
Goodness.

804
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:54,480
I thought this was a courtroom.

805
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:57,440
Professor He, I'm solving a problem here.

806
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,560
I know. Think of me as an audience member.

807
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:02,280
I heard something about spreading rumors.

808
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:03,280
Who did that?

809
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:05,360
The post on the forum.

810
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:08,120
Cai Minmin said Li Jing
posted the rumor about her.

811
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:09,520
She has no proof though.

812
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:13,440
But the proof that she beat her up
is more than sufficient.

813
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,560
Both offenses are severe.

814
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:19,320
Especially spreading rumors.
It's more serious.

815
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:20,800
Make a police report.

816
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,080
Let the police handle it.

817
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:27,080
Wait!

818
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:30,440
The phone reminded me of something.

819
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:32,040
The photos in the post

820
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:33,800
were taken with a phone.

821
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,080
We can just check their phones.

822
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:38,600
Even if the photos were deleted,

823
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:40,120
we could retrieve them with an app.

824
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:42,360
Can that be done?

825
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:43,520
Of course.

826
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:46,160
Come on! Show us your phones
and prove it to everyone.

827
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:51,680
But...

828
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:54,360
But the phone

829
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:56,400
is a very personal item.

830
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:58,200
That's true.

831
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:00,920
The university won't allow teachers
to check your phones.

832
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:02,880
It's best to report it.

833
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,680
It's easier for the police
to collect evidence.

834
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:06,000
It's more credible too.

835
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:09,000
Nowadays, even hidden IP addresses

836
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:10,800
can be tracked easily with technology.

837
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:15,200
Can't find your phone again?

838
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:17,600
-Use mine.
-Okay.

839
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:20,320
I thought it would be okay

840
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:21,880
once the post is deleted.

841
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:23,760
If the police find out,

842
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:26,440
the rumormonger will likely be expelled.

843
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:28,600
Hold on. It's connected.

844
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:30,440
Professor Song, Professor He, don't!

845
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:35,680
What's the matter?

846
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:37,680
I...

847
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:51,680
When I heard you blabbing

848
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:54,040
about retrieval apps
and tracking hidden IPs,

849
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:55,720
I knew you were bluffing.

850
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:57,160
Hello, professors.

851
00:42:57,840 --> 00:43:00,480
It's not the first time
we teamed up so perfectly.

852
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:03,920
Those kids can't handle
even the slightest pressure.

853
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:06,560
And they don't even have common sense.
It's too easy to trick them.

854
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,760
And they even dare to do bad things.

855
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Jealousy brings out your bad side.

856
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:15,400
Consider it a free lesson
outside of the syllabus.

857
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:16,400
