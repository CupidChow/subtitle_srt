1
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,480
For example, you and T-Rex

2
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:06,560
may possibly know that the other person
likes someone else.

3
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,360
So you took a step back

4
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,720
and just stayed as friends first.

5
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,040
Or maybe you like someone else,

6
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,080
but you think he's not bad,

7
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,760
so you befriend him first.

8
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,360
These type of friends

9
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,160
all share a common name.

10
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,760
A backup.

11
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,200
All right, you're not like that.

12
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,080
Of course not!

13
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,240
Some people enjoy flirting.

14
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,360
But I could never stand it.

15
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,880
Flirting is an emotional need too.

16
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,800
Those who can't tolerate flirting

17
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,080
will miss half the pleasure of love.

18
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:47,440
That's why Chang Huan is a poor guy.

19
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,360
Why did you mention that geek?

20
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,400
Why would I flirt with him?

21
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:54,840
We're frenemies.

22
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,440
However,

23
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,600
you may not take T-Rex as a backup.

24
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,760
But you might be his backup.

25
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,000
If he can't get his dream goddess,

26
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,000
there's still an innocent girl beside him.

27
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:11,880
Miss.

28
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,880
Can you be more optimistic?

29
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:18,320
Ye Luming isn't the kind of
arrogant president you imagine.

30
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,280
I know.

31
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:22,280
An arrogant president
wouldn't simply befriend women.

32
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,600
That's okay.

33
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,720
I'll be his terminator.

34
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,400
Come in.

35
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,480
It's 7:30 p.m.

36
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,440
The others have left.
Do you need any help?

37
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,840
It's okay.

38
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,240
You can't help much.

39
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,600
The supermarket is having
an anniversary sale in two days.

40
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:03,280
I need to restock office supplies.

41
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,240
I'm on leave tomorrow morning
to visit a Chinese clinic.

42
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,920
If I don't stay back, I won't finish it.

43
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,840
Continue with your work.

44
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,240
I'll help you relax.

45
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,480
We're in the office!

46
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,800
It's already 7:30 p.m. No one is around.

47
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,600
The others have left.

48
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,320
Your shoulders are so stiff. Relax.

49
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,400
Do you have any female cousins?

50
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,200
No. Why?

51
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:52,720
Nothing.

52
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,200
You seem to really know
how to please women.

53
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,880
Just ask me directly
if you want to ask about my ex.

54
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,240
Don't be so subtle.

55
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,800
I prefer straightforwardness.

56
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,720
I've only done this for my mom.

57
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,280
That's the spot.

58
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,320
-Here?
-Yes.

59
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,480
It's sore.

60
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,160
He Fanxing.

61
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,840
Seriously. What should I say to you?

62
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,480
Mr. Li.

63
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,000
-We--
-How many times have I said it?

64
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,960
Do not work overtime!

65
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,440
You told me you're not well this morning
and needed a massage.

66
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,880
Yet, you work late!

67
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,600
You're putting me in a tough spot.

68
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,520
I still have to finish my work.

69
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,200
Don't do it again.

70
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,080
Yuan Song.

71
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,000
You did well during the event.

72
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,200
Good job.

73
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,440
When I was your age,

74
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,560
I was still working as a wall painter.

75
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,200
Thank you, Mr. Li.

76
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,120
Previously,

77
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,160
I told her not to be too harsh.

78
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,120
She said you're her brother's student.

79
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,480
She had to be harsh.

80
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,120
I thought you would be scared of her.

81
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,560
But it seems pretty good now.

82
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,920
You're helping her out after work.

83
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,400
It's my duty.

84
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,680
Yes, he's pretty responsible.

85
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,560
He said that

86
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,160
when he was back at home,

87
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,760
he would give his mom massages.

88
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,880
He gave me one just now.

89
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,320
I feel much better now.

90
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,560
That's a good deal there, Fanxing.

91
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,600
You got yourself a son there.

92
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:51,960
All right.

93
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,440
Go home soon if you're done.

94
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,560
I'll get going.

95
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,560
But remember,

96
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,040
your health comes first.

97
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,640
Do you understand?

98
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,560
-See you.
-Goodbye, Mr. Li.

99
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:01,760
Goodbye.

100
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,080
Are you bothered

101
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,400
by what he said?

102
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:18,840
What did he say?

103
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,080
Should I be bothered?

104
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:25,800
Goodness.

105
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,680
Let's finish this and go home quickly.

106
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,680
Nietzsche once said that.

107
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,400
"Brave, unconcerned,

108
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:45,440
mocking, violent. Thus, wisdom wants us.

109
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:49,160
She is a woman and only loves a warrior."

110
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,880
This means that

111
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,680
women are akin to wisdom.

112
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,920
Whoever dares cheat wisdom

113
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:57,240
must be extremely stupid.

114
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,440
Dongya.

115
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,080
Those are only rumors.

116
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,920
My ex-girlfriends
can be counted with one hand.

117
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,880
Stop shouting, Mom!

118
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,080
I have to hang up, baby.

119
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,600
I have to read the bible for my mom.

120
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,640
Yes.

121
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,000
She's a Christian.

122
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,880
Goodbye for now.

123
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,360
Hey.

124
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,840
Your Dongya's is so talkative.

125
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,480
Both of you talk for hours every night.

126
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,480
I'm breaking up with her.

127
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,360
I can see that.

128
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,640
Every time you mention Nietzsche

129
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,360
and philosophy with girls,

130
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,880
I know that it's almost over.

131
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,200
Woman.

132
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,960
Wisdom is your name.

133
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,240
Applying wisdom in love
is nothing but a waste.

134
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,360
You're wrong.

135
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,160
A relationship needs great wisdom.

136
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,800
You may look stupid, but be wise.

137
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,160
Know what to ask and what not to.

138
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,120
Only then will you
manage it with great ease.

139
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,040
No.

140
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,080
Only men need that.

141
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,520
Women are good at thinking ahead.

142
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,320
Have you started to think ahead?

143
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,760
Didn't you see my blind date at the mall?

144
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,920
What if I say it was a coincidence?

145
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,600
-What if I say he's a friend?
-I believe you!

146
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:21,080
Ask whatever you want in the future.

147
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,800
We're siblings.

148
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:25,000
We don't need to use skills and tricks.

149
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,120
Didn't you just apply hand cream?

150
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,040
That one was for exfoliation.

151
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,280
This is to moisturize.

152
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,040
Hand mask.

153
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:49,800
Do you know?

154
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,480
When women are in their 30s,

155
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,720
their skin sag

156
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,760
and their plump cheeks disappear.

157
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,800
A woman's hands
are as important as her face.

158
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,120
I must certainly protect them.

159
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,440
Or I'll be mistaken as a mother!

160
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,840
Did something trigger you again?

161
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:06,960
Canyang.

162
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,640
How do I look?

163
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,680
Not bad if you suck in your belly.

164
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:13,920
Was it so obvious?

165
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,000
Which office worker doesn't have a belly?

166
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,200
No way. I have to go on a diet.

167
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,880
My braised meat is here.

168
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:26,840
Your food is here.

169
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:27,800
Yes, thank you.

170
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,880
Fatty chicken feet.

171
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,720
I'll get the beers. Scoot!

172
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,040
Didn't you say you're on a diet?

173
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,560
Well, I won't gain much weight

174
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,480
when I'm on my period.

175
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:04,240
Later, I'll drink tea
to remove the grease.

176
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,480
Are you drinking cold beer
while having your period?

177
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,280
I'll warm it up in my mouth
before I swallow it.

178
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,400
You're awesome.

179
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,840
Okay. I'll be there right away.

180
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,640
You're already downstairs.

181
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,480
I'll put on my shoes and be down.

182
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:41,960
Dad, Mom. My friend's here.
I'm going to the clinic.

183
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,600
Is it the one you met on your blind date?

184
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,400
Yes. I'm off!

185
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,480
Take care.

186
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,960
All you do is eat.

187
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,240
Quick!

188
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,560
What are you doing?

189
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,080
Come and take a look.

190
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,640
Qingfeng.

191
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,120
What car is this guy driving?

192
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,320
It's too far. I can't see it.

193
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:14,200
It'd be nice if we have binoculars now.

194
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,600
He's coming out!

195
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,680
He's neither plump nor skinny.

196
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,280
He seems okay.

197
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,040
By looking at his head,

198
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,800
can you judge his figure?

199
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:29,840
If his scalp can be seen in his 30s,

200
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,240
he'll be bald by 40!

201
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,440
His hair grows pretty well.

202
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,120
There's hair transplant now.

203
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,320
Why do you always go against me?

204
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:44,520
Why do you take everyone
as your son-in-law?

205
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,600
Your eyes are shining like bulbs.

206
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,200
You're exaggerating.

207
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:54,600
I won't take our neighbor, Jiacheng,
even if he kneels before us.

208
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,760
Watch your head.

209
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,880
Did you see that?

210
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,120
He even opened the door for Fanxing.

211
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,320
Such a gentleman.

212
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,040
How considerate.

213
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:17,040
He'll help with housework
in the future for sure.

214
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,640
You! Why did you rush off?

215
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,680
<i>So do you think men and women
can never be just friends?</i>

216
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:42,880
<i>They can be,</i>

217
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,520
<i>but not too platonic.</i>

218
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,680
There must be motives.

219
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:50,280
For example, you and T-Rex

220
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,000
may possibly know that
the other person has someone else.

221
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,560
So you took a step back

222
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,960
and just stayed as friends first.

223
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,920
Or maybe you like someone else,

224
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,360
but you think he's not bad,

225
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,480
so you befriend him first.

226
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,040
These type of friends

227
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,040
all share a common name.

228
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:09,960
A backup.

229
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,520
I'm not who I was ten years ago.

230
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,920
If I stay up all night for a project,

231
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,760
I'll get backaches and leg cramps.

232
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,840
Do you know?

233
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,040
A study shows that

234
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,640
when you start to click on

235
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:30,920
those health tips from the posts
in your parents' social circle,

236
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,200
it means you're middle-aged.

237
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,680
Why aren't you talking?

238
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,120
Are you in a bad mood?

239
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,280
No.

240
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,080
Sorry to bother you.

241
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,560
You stayed up all night.

242
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,720
Yet, you had to get up early
just to send me to the clinic.

243
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,440
"Just"?

244
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,000
What are you saying?

245
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,920
I need a massage too.

246
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,320
I just passed by and picked you up.

247
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,880
That's a hassle too.

248
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,440
What's gotten into you?

249
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,040
I'll be direct then.

250
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,240
Luming.

251
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,080
Am I a backup to you?

252
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,760
"Backup"?

253
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,000
Usually,

254
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:33,160
if you treat a woman so well
when you like someone else,

255
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,600
isn't this woman a backup?

256
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:40,320
If you don't get the one you like,
you can settle for the second choice.

257
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:44,920
Fanxing.

258
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,880
It's only been a few days.
Now you're rubbing it in again.

259
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,800
If I have backups,

260
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,640
will I still be single at 37?

261
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,800
You do have a point.

262
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,160
What's a backup?

263
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,960
Backup means average,

264
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,080
so-so,

265
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,240
just okay.

266
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,440
God only knows what's in your head.

267
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:16,400
Are you looking down on me or yourself?

268
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,040
Why would you be a backup?

269
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,480
Make a vow then.

270
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,520
What?

271
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:24,760
People always become the person they hate.

272
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,920
What you didn't do when you were 30

273
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:29,400
doesn't mean you won't do it
when you are 37.

274
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,400
You may know a man but not his heart.

275
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:34,360
No. You have to swear.

276
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,440
Swear?

277
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,480
I swear.

278
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,600
I, Ye Luming,
don't see He Fanxing as a backup.

279
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,760
Otherwise, my company
will go bankrupt and I'll achieve nothing.

280
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:02,560
Is that all?

281
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,360
Are you done?

282
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,720
I thought people would normally swear

283
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,320
about being struck by lightning.

284
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,760
Was it not vicious enough?

285
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:16,520
All right.

286
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,800
If I, Ye Luming,
take He Fanxing as a backup,

287
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,960
I won't get my dream goddess!

288
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:25,040
Not only will I go bankrupt,
so will my sister.

289
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:27,960
After she's divorced,
she'll be paralyzed and alone.

290
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,680
Don't involve your family--

291
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,920
My brother-in-law will lose every gamble.

292
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,120
-That's enough.
-As for my niece,

293
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,640
she'll be a poor beggar.

294
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,960
-Okay! I trust you!
-With facial palsy

295
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,640
-and forever talks like--
-I trust you!

296
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,080
I trust you!

297
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:43,720
Do you trust me now?

298
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,080
Shouldn't you apologize?

299
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,360
I'm sorry.

300
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,240
My head is all over the place.

301
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,560
I offer my sincerest apology.

302
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:01,840
I apologize.

303
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:03,840
Is that enough?

304
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,000
That'll do.

305
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:11,160
Get me a pack of cigarettes
and I'll forgive you.

306
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,480
Sure!

307
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,160
Wait.

308
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,720
I thought you didn't smoke.

309
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,000
Do you have to do this?

310
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,840
Who asked them to steal Melon's toner?

311
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:00,040
Iâ€™ll give them a taste of

312
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:03,960
Zhanni's Incredibly Sensational Toner.

313
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:13,800
Have some tea!

314
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,240
What are you doing?

315
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,600
This is a bad idea.

316
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:28,880
What's bad about it?

317
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:31,200
I just made a toner and left it there.

318
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,680
If they don't secretly use it,

319
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,040
they'll be fine.

320
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,760
Even if you put it that way.

321
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,520
-My eyes!
-It stings!

322
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:41,920
Let me wash my eyes!

323
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,600
-It burns!
-Go away!

324
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,200
-Let me wash first!
-Go away.

325
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,360
I'm washing first!

326
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,440
Move aside! Let me wash!

327
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,120
It stings!

328
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,840
Let me wash first!

329
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,040
It stings.

330
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,360
<i>Dear beloved customers,</i>

331
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,640
<i>from 8 o'clock to 10 o'clock,</i>

332
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05,240

333
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:08,360

00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,440

00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:17,080
Remember to remind the staff

337
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,680
about the arrangement of goods.

338
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,360
During this period, the consumers are
mainly the elderlies and housewives.

339
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:25,040
Redemption works better on them.

340
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:29,480
Remember to replace the chewing gums
and condoms at the cashiers

341
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:32,480
with the currently on sale
disposable baby products.

342
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,720
-Got it.
-Right.

343
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,600
For tomorrow,

344
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:40,520
the first 500 consumers get
a two-liter bottle of laundry detergent.

345
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,480
Did you put the banner?

346
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,040
The banner is done.

347
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:45,680
It's our first time working
with this chain store.

348
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,560
We must be alert during these seven days.

349
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:51,280
Make sure the details and time
of the activities are perfect.

350
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,920
Got it. I'll check it out now.

351
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,280
Go ahead.

352
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:37,680
Is it heavy?

353
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,000
It's okay.

354
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,280
-Let's sit here.
-Sure.

355
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:47,480
What do you want to eat?

356
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,440
-Beef noodles.
-Beef noodles.

357
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,320
No parsley. More vinegar, less spicy.

358
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,520
No parsley. More vinegar, less spicy.

359
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,600
<i>What are you doing?</i>

360
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:13,120
<i>Just restocking office supplies.</i>

361
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,160
<i>Having lunch now.</i>

362
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,560
<i>Are you finally talking to me?</i>

363
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,400
<i>With who?</i>

364
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,560
<i>A company intern.</i>

365
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:25,880
<i>He's helping me.</i>

366
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,440
<i>Liar.</i>

367
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,400
YE LUMING

368
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:42,920
This is bad.

369
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,240
What's wrong?

370
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,920
Why? Did you lose something?

371
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:49,160
Keys? Mobile phone?

372
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:50,560
Wallet?

373
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:51,640
I found it.

374
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,240
What is it?

375
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:58,840
It's gone again.

376
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,520
A holy breath is what it lacks.

377
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,480
Here. Give it a blow.

378
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,840
You're fooling me again.

379
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,280
It's for you.

380
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:39,880
I bought it for you when I was shopping.

381
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:42,640
You have great taste.

382
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,600
Put it on if you like it.

383
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,080
Okay.

384
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:00,440
It looks nice.

385
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,320
But

386
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:06,120
don't men usually put it on
for their girlfriends?

387
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,280
It seems that
young people are more practical.

388
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,040
<i>I totally forgot about this advantage.</i>

389
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,800
<i>I'm too young indeed.</i>

390
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:31,080
It's so nice to be young.

391
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,280
<i>His skin is firm.</i>

392
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:38,200
<i>He smiles like a child.</i>

393
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,920
No wonder young foxes

394
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:44,600
can steal food from old foxes.

395
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,840
I'm so furious.

396
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:54,640
No!

397
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,040
I'm not furious.

398
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:58,680
I'm not furious.

399
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:01,160
Others may feel fury but not me.

400
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,480
Who'll benefit if I die from fury?

401
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:07,120
No one but that young fox.

402
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,040
Dream on!

403
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,840
He Fanxing will be mine eventually.

404
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,040
She's mine!

405
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:15,160
She's mine!

406
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,440
She's mine!

407
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,160
Take a good look at who I am.

408
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,800
For I'm the fair-faced scholar,

409
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,360
Ye Luming!

410
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,160
Hold on.

411
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,280
Have I seen him somewhere?

412
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,960
Whose WeChat Moments was it?

413
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,440
Let me introduce to you.

414
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,440
This is your aunt, He Fanxing.

415
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,360
Nice to meet you, Aunt!

416
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:04,400
You look so pretty, Aunt!

417
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:08,480
We're a family from now on.

418
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:09,520
No need to be polite.

419
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,240
You said you wanted
to introduce your boyfriend.

420
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:14,280
Where is he?

421
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,560
Come over here.

422
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,120
This is the dream guy I've been chasing.

423
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:25,840
-What?
-Meet my uncle and aunt.

424
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,720
You can address them the way I do.

425
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,520
Uncle. Aunt.

426
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,120
Are you dating him?

427
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,600
Who's your uncle?

428
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,000
Why are you crying?

429
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:47,720
Stop crying!

430
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,880
I should be crying after knowing
you're with him!

431
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:16,200
I'm here to see Love Charm.
I hope it's not a bother.

432
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,320
What's with the sudden ambush?

433
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,320
What ambush?

434
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,560
How rude would that be!

435
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,240
I sent you a message on WeChat.

436
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:26,520
Did you?

437
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:38,480
<i>I'm downstairs.
I'm here to see Love Charm.</i>

438
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,480
It was sent one minute ago.

439
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:42,240
It's not so sudden at all.

440
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,600
What if I'm not home?

441
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:47,600
I looked at your windows.
The lights were on.

442
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:53,960
Any drinks for you?

443
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,320
Anything.

444
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,160
Just drink the air then!

445
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:01,600
Love Charm.

446
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,320
Come here.

447
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:06,240
Are you mad that your godmother
hasn't come by lately?

448
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,360
That's enough.

449
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,920
No way. You can't eat that much.

450
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:23,720
A pack of cigarettes.

451
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:25,000
Don't be mad at me.

452
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,400
Have you ever seen me smoke?

453
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:31,880
What's this?

454
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:35,200
This is a magical cigarette box.

455
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,520
There's a manual.

456
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:40,440
You can practice it
to entertain your dream goddess.

457
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:41,600
For example,

458
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,400
ask her to blow a holy breath

459
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:46,760
and transform a necklace
or ring out of it.

460
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,040
The boss told me that

461
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:52,160
it works almost every time
on wedding proposals.

462
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,800
Thank you. How kind of you.

463
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,720
We're best friends!

464
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,520
Why did you go to the supermarket today?

465
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:14,480
We planned their anniversary sale.

466
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,160
I went there to supervise.

467
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,640
The one you caught on camera

468
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:21,640
is indeed my boyfriend.

469
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:24,920
How do you find him?

470
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:28,440
An average Joe. Break up with him.

471
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,040
Be honest.

472
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,520
He's all right.

473
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,120
Really?

474
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,440
Fine.

475
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:40,920
He's quite handsome.

476
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:48,360
Don't go around telling people.

477
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:51,760
I don't want to announce
our relationship publicly yet.

478
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,880
Or things may become complicated.

479
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:54,920
Look.

480
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,840
My colleague's senior

481
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,200
is your secretary

482
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,520
and you're quite close with Mr. Li.

483
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:05,600
The walls have ears.

484
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,520
-What?
-Ms. He Fanxing.

485
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,680
I really think you should
see a psychiatrist.

486
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:20,200
You're so self-absorbed.

487
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:22,920
In your imagination,

488
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:25,680
I'm either busy making you my backup

489
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:28,720
or busy telling others
about your love story.

490
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:31,600
Am I the neighborhood committee's aunt?

491
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,080
I'm a busy man!

492
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,200
I know you're busy.

493
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,680
But you're so talented.

494
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,800
You seem to do it with great ease.

495
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,560
"With great ease"?

496
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,760
Like our national table tennis team.

497
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,720
They make other players tremble.

498
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:48,600
Before they became terrifying players,

499
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,360
how much did they practice?

500
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:51,680
How many balls did they destroy?

501
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,960
If you want to achieve greatness,

502
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,880
you have to pay the price.

503
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,440
What do you mean by great ease?

504
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:03,160
Although I didn't get what you just said,

505
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:06,960
it seems that you do have a point.

506
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:11,360
Well, beautiful women

507
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:13,240
are usually self-absorbed.

508
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:14,880
I get it too.

509
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,600
I didn't think I was beautiful.

510
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:21,600
Stop acting.

511
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,360
The most beautiful woman
are those that are unaware of it.

512
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,880
Don't try to compliment yourself.

513
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:32,080
Come on.

514
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:38,120
You're making me blush.

515
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,000
Good morning, ma'am.

516
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:44,200
Hello, ma'am.

517
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:47,800
You previously inquired
Amazing Decoration about a renovation.

518
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:48,800
<i>Are you mental?</i>

519
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,000
<i>Who are you calling "ma'am"?</i>

520
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:53,960
Do you know why you got scolded?

521
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:57,520
Did you read her information properly?

522
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,120
She's only 28!

523
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,720
And you called her, "ma'am".
How can she not be mad?

524
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:04,440
Didn't you say calling
elder women as "ma'am"

525
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,240
will sound more friendly?

526
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:10,720
If a 28-year-old is old enough
to be called "ma'am",

527
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:12,720
then what about a 40-year-old?

528
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,560
Should I call her "madam"?

529
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:18,880
Has anyone ever told you
that you have a very low EQ?

530
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:22,280
I was just being honest.

531
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:24,800
All right.

532
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,120
Please honestly remember it by heart.

533
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,040
For ladies below 40,

534
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,280
address them as "miss" and their name.

535
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:33,720
For those aged between 40 and 55,

536
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,520
address them as "ma'am".

537
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:38,240
Remember. Just as "ma'am"!

538
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:39,400
Without their name.

539
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:42,480
For those above 55,
you can address them as "madam".

540
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:46,520
Is there any difference between
saying their name and just "ma'am"?

541
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,320
The former is

542
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:50,840
a neighborhood busybody.

543
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:52,200
The latter is

544
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:54,920
a mature and charming lady.

545
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:57,560
I understand it now.

546
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,280
Thank you, Madam Cong Xiao.

547
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:20,000
-Hey, you.
-Chang Huan!

548
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:23,040
Don't scratch. Use this ointment.

549
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:25,080
Thank you.

550
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:26,440
How much is this?

551
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:27,840
Don't bother. It's cheap.

552
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:31,480
You said that you'd treat me
to a feast on payday.

553
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:32,600
Don't forget.

554
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,800
Sure, I'll buy you a feast.

555
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:37,840
That's about right.

556
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:39,320
I'll get back to work.

557
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:41,680
Thank you.

558
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,600
Hey. Why did you call me?

559
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:54,640
Nothing.

560
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:13,760
Ms. He.

561
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,920
You actually bought
this limited edition necklace.

562
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:19,120
You're so generous to yourself!

563
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,360
-Is it a limited edition?
-Yes.

564
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:22,600
Is it expensive?

565
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,920
Maybe 4,000 yuan
is a small amount for you.

566
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:28,280
For a white-collar worker,
one has to save for two months.

567
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:31,440
My monthly salary isn't even that much.

568
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:34,040
Even if I tighten my belt,
I still wouldn't buy it.

569
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:36,960
Girls like you will receive it
from your boyfriends.

570
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:39,720
But I think that it's better
when we earned it ourselves.

571
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,560
We can buy whatever we want.

572
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,360
I once saw the news.

573
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:46,680
A man took out a loan
to buy his girlfriend a new phone.

574
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:49,280
The interest piled up to 200,000 yuan!

575
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:51,520
His family sold their house
to pay his debt.

576
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,440
That's too much.

577
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:56,120
She should know
what her boyfriend can afford.

578
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:59,320
Men and their pride.

579
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,760
They live beyond their means
to impress others.

580
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:05,600
Enough with that.

581
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,480
I went on a blind date yesterday.

582
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:10,400
That man popped three questions.

583
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:11,920
"Do you cook?"

584
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,600
"Is your cooking good?"

585
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:17,800
"Would you quit your job
and cook at home after marriage?"

586
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:19,760
I think that

587
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,520
he has no other requirements

588
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:23,360
except for good food.

589
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:25,640
I think that he wasn't there
for a partner,

590
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:28,000
but to interview a cook.

591
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:31,000
That man was only looking for a cook.

592
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,920
A lot of men are looking for a superwoman.

593
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,440
They hope that their partners are pretty

594
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:37,480
with high salaries,

595
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:39,520
gentle and filial to their parents.

596
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:40,920
They want two children.

597
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:44,520
But then, they find it hard
to raise the family alone.

598
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,840
That's why they need their wives

599
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:50,120
to take good care of the family
and earn money at the same time.

600
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:52,920
It's terrifying.

601
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,800
I wouldn't want to end up on a blind date.

602
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,000
Why would you need a blind date?

603
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,720
Don't you have a target?

604
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,600
Did you notice?

605
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:04,760
It's super obvious.

606
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:06,120
Who is it?

607
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,280
It must be...

608
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,280
Yuan Song. Am I right?

609
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,240
No, not him.

610
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:14,920
Is it Luo Meng from the marketing team?

611
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:19,360
Is it Song Xiaoqi who's around your age?

612
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,280
I don't have any idea then.

613
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:24,920
It isn't Chang Huan, right?

614
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:34,960
Why are you staring at me?

615
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:36,640
Isn't he nice?

616
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:39,320
It's not that I don't think he's nice.

617
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,000
But I'm just surprised.

618
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:44,640
A girl like you
who watches Korean drama at work

619
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,280
and adores male celebrities...

620
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:49,200
Why would you fall in love

621
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:51,240
with an engineering geek like him?

622
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:53,600
I didn't expect this either.

623
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,240
But he's different from the other geeks.

624
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:57,640
First of all,

625
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,280
he's good-looking.

626
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,640
Although he looks scruffy

627
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,600
and always wears baggy tees and jeans.

628
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,760
When he comes to work,
his hair often looks unkempt,

629
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,440
but his clothes are clean.

630
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,400
He washes his hair every day.

631
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:12,440
And he's unlike other male colleagues

632
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,720
who always tell dirty jokes to girls.

633
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,280
He's quite a gentleman.

634
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:20,640
When we go out, he'd ask the girls
not to drink too much.

635
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:21,760
When it's too late,

636
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:24,600
he'd send the girls home
even if he appears unwilling.

637
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:25,920
Also,

638
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,800
he often complains
about the clients being difficult.

639
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,800
But he still gets the job done.

640
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:34,440
He only occasionally
spends money on games.

641
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,200
Besides a home loan,

642
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:38,560
he saves his money for early retirement.

643
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,320
Anyway,

644
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:43,480
he fulfills all aspects of my ideal geek!

645
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:47,440
Such a nice young man
was next to me all this time!

646
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:50,760
Yet, I was so blind
and didn't even see him!

647
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,320
He isn't your type!

648
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,800
Yes, he's your type.

649
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:58,240
So what if he's my type?

650
00:37:58,560 --> 00:37:59,800
He's so dumb.

651
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,320
It's like talking to a wall.

652
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:05,000
Cong Xiao can help you!

653
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,680
Although they're enemies,

654
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:10,240
they're frenemies
who love and hate each other.

655
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:14,040
They even go out on weekends
to bowl together.

656
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:16,360
Can you?

657
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,840
Sure. No problem.

658
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:21,960
You're the best, Cong Xiao!

659
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:23,680
Here, eat up.

660
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:25,160
I want some too.

661
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:36,840
1,500 yuan for living expenses.

662
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:40,480
4,000 yuan for the rent.

663
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:44,720
500 yuan for dates.

664
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,200
That's enough.

665
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,680
4,500 yuan for gifts.

666
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,560
The roses and the necklace.

667
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:54,400
Telco and transportation
would be 300 yuan.

668
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:58,720
And 1,000 yuan
for miscellaneous expenditures.

669
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,520
He would need at least 12,000 yuan.

670
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:09,840
The salary of an intern is 2,800 yuan.

671
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:14,360
If I deduct 350 yuan
for him being late and leaving early,

672
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:21,120
that leaves him with 2,450 yuan.

673
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:30,440
There's no way he can afford all this.

674
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:34,240
How much does he need
from his family to fill this gap?

675
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:48,280
What should I do?

676
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:55,720
Looking at this blue wall,

677
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:57,120
what do you see?

678
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,040
Just a wall.

679
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:01,120
Isn't it?

680
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:03,840
Whether it's blue or green,

681
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,480
it's still a wall.

682
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:08,960
Our customer, Mr. Zhao,
is an art enthusiast.

683
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:10,040
At first,

684
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:12,040
he insisted on a dark green wall,

685
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:14,040
saying he wanted a forest feel.

686
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,440
But it's blue now.

687
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,160
That's because

688
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:20,080
after making it a forest,

689
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:23,000
he realized he prefers the ocean.

690
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,480
Vast and magnificent.

691
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:29,160
But blue doesn't really go
with the overall theme.

692
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:32,200
Our customer has realized this too.

693
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,280
The ceilings are almost done.

694
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,840
Would he suddenly want a snowy mountain?

695
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:42,800
Aren't we meeting at 3:30 p.m.?

696
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,280
Why isn't he here yet?

697
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:46,800
Young man.

698
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:49,640
When the client is late,
they must have their reasons.

699
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:51,320
Just wait.

700
00:40:58,840 --> 00:40:59,840
<i>The client is late.</i>

701
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,440
<i>I might not be able
to return by 5 o'clock.</i>

702
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:05,360
<i>Is there anything
I can't see in your house?</i>

703
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,000
<i>I'm at your door already.</i>

704
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:10,880
<i>The password is 170416.</i>

705
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,040
<i>Wait for me inside.</i>

706
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:21,480
I'm here because I know you're not in.

707
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:22,480
Silly.

708
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:24,920
Braised Meat.

709
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:11,680
Stay here and be good.

710
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:18,880
YOUR PACKAGE IS EXPIRED,
PLEASE CONTACT OUR CUSTOMER SUPPORT

711
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:28,480
I'd like to pay for the cable TV bill.

712
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:33,600
POMEGRANATE

713
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:35,200
CANTALOUPE

714
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:12,000
Time to eat!

715
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:13,600
Let me pour it in first.

716
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:28,800
