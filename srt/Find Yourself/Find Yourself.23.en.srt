1
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,480
The others have left.
Why are you still here?

2
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,760
You're leaving the company soon.

3
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,960
If you have unfinished tasks,

4
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,680
you can ask for help from others.

5
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,560
What's the matter?

6
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,960
When we're alone,

7
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,880
can we act like strangers?

8
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,880
I don't want to talk to you.

9
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,720
Didn't you say

10
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,800
that we should be like how we were?

11
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,040
I was being polite.

12
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,040
You didn't get it?

13
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,120
I'm outside the office.

14
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,560
I don't see you.

15
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,640
Here!

16
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:33,760
Here!

17
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,800
I see you. I'm coming.

18
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,760
<i>Love.</i>

19
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:20,200
<i>When it's strong,
it makes you jump over the moon.</i>

20
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,560
<i>After breaking up,</i>

21
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,360
<i>it hurts you deeply.</i>

22
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,720
<i>In order to keep our remaining dignity,</i>

23
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,120
<i>we must pretend not to care</i>

24
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,640
<i>and be the bigger person.</i>

25
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,880
<i>Pretend that</i>

26
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,400
<i>we don't love each other at all.</i>

27
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,920
Wasn't that funny?

28
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,640
Yes, it was!

29
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,640
It's my turn.

30
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,960
One day, a rabbit was home watching TV.

31
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,040
Then, there was a knock on the door.
It was a snail.

32
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,640
It asked, "Little rabbit,

33
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,600
can you give me some water?"

34
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:17,800
Without hesitation,
the rabbit kicked the snail away.

35
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,400
Three years later,

36
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,760
when the rabbit was at home
watching TV again,

37
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,920
someone knocked on the door.

38
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,800
The rabbit opened the door
and saw the snail again.

39
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,680
It asked the rabbit angrily,

40
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,120
"Why did you kick me?"

41
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,360
"Why did you kick me?"

42
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,320
Big Head, your turn.

43
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,560
This joke has been passed down in
my family since the Three Kingdoms era.

44
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,040
Listen carefully.

45
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:48,840
One day, Cao Cao went to Hua Tuo's house
with Cao Chong.

46
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,400
At the door, Cao Cao smiled and said,

47
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,320
"I'm visiting you with my youngest one."

48
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,520
Hua Tuo said,

49
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:58,680
"Just come empty-handed.
Why did you bring a fruit?"

50
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,600
Yuan Song.

51
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,520
Don't you find our jokes funny?

52
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,320
Don't bother.

53
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,160
Stop trying to make me happy.

54
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:20,720
It's just a breakup.
It's not like I can't live without her.

55
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,440
Look.

56
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,840
I told you.

57
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,440
Yuan Song can let it go.

58
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,920
It's nothing serious.

59
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,280
But Melon was so worried.

60
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,360
She wanted to cheer you up.

61
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,720
I didn't know that you'd recover so fast.

62
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,560
There are plenty of fish in the sea.

63
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,960
You're a true man.

64
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,920
Here, to a tough guy like you.

65
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,480
Why don't you consider being with me?

66
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,360
Show your ex-girlfriend
that you have other suitors.

67
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,480
Forget it. I was just joking.

68
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,600
What a coward.

69
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,000
Tripe is the crunchiest
when it is almost cooked.

70
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,080
Try one.

71
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,600
It is crunchy.

72
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,320
You eat some too.

73
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,840
I like seeing you eat.

74
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,280
Chang Huan, if we are together,

75
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,240
I'll transform you into a chubby guy.

76
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,200
Then you'll be comfortable in the winter.

77
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,200
No other women will fall for you then.

78
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,760
Right, Cong Xiao?

79
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,000
No.

80
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,120
Many girls like chubby guys.

81
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,440
They look cute.

82
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,600
But not you anyway.

83
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,800
You like rich guys.

84
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,560
Like Sanmao,

85
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,440
I won't even marry a millionaire
if I don't love him.

86
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,040
I'd marry a billionaire if I love him.

87
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,960
The billionaire-marrying Ms. Cong,

88
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,720
how is it going between you and Mr. Ye?

89
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,920
It's already in the past.

90
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,320
He likes someone else.

91
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,440
You're giving up so easily?

92
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,080
Then? Do I wait for him?

93
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,560
That'd be a long wait.

94
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,720
I don't have the patience
to wait for somebody.

95
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,920
But they won't last long.

96
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,000
You met his girlfriend?

97
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,160
-Yes.
-Is she amazing?

98
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:27,080
Very ordinary.

99
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,320
Here.

100
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,680
The pork aorta is nice. Try one.

101
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,960
-Really?
-Yes.

102
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:47,000
If I were Chang Huan's girlfriend,

103
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,360
I'd be upset now.

104
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:53,360
You two are being very ignorant right now!

105
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,160
It's as if I'm not even here.

106
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,120
No.

107
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,600
We're used to this.

108
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,160
Well, do you want a pork aorta?

109
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,520
Didn't you promise me

110
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,320
that we'd hang out
with the premise of dating?

111
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,160
Since you've promised me,

112
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,440
you should keep a distance
from other girls when...

113
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,600
Even if she's a close friend
like Cong Xiao.

114
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,480
You should mind my feelings.

115
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,960
I'm not a third wheel.

116
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,040
Not at all. I'm the third wheel.

117
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,120
-Don't be mad.
-I know.

118
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:33,160
You encouraged me to go after Chang Huan

119
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,360
and brought us together.

120
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,680
So I'm not mad.

121
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:39,040
I was just reminding you
to know your place.

122
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,840
I got it.

123
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,960
He's just a friend. Don't worry.

124
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:46,880
That's right.

125
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,680
I'm not her cup of tea.

126
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,400
Well, you're my cup of tea.

127
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,680
I'm digging in.

128
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,920
-Here, have another one.
-Okay.

129
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,600
-Eat up.
-Okay.

130
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,880
SONG YUAN, HE FANXING

131
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,720
HE FANXING

132
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,960
SONG YUAN

133
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,720
Why write it backwards?

134
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,440
I have OCD.

135
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,880
I need to get the dynasties
in the right sequence.

136
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:49,680
Actually, my name has nothing to do
with the dynasties.

137
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,600
<i>Tang, Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing.</i>

138
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,080
<i>This sounds more comfortable.</i>

139
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,800
<i>It's so good to be in love.</i>

140
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:13,280
We can make cups happily,

141
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:16,800
watch movies
and enjoy the night view together.

142
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,440
We can also hug each other by the lake.

143
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:23,480
If we break up one day,

144
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,880
you must...

145
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,720
You must really curse me
with an unhappy life.

146
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:28,800
Why must I curse you?

147
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,200
Because

148
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:34,240
only those who aren't in love
can wish each other happiness.

149
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,480
But if we still love each other,

150
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,640
we would hope that
the other person feels sad

151
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,320
<i>and regrets breaking up.</i>

152
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,360
<i>So, even then,</i>

153
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,240
<i>you were already prepared to break up?</i>

154
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,680
Can you

155
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:21,120
date me?

156
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:39,720
Will I do?

157
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,600
What?

158
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,680
Compared to a blind date,

159
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,960
am I not a better choice?

160
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:02,960
You look pretty this way.

161
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,600
On Sunday evening,

162
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,600
let's meet at the usual place.

163
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,440
Why are you in such a rush?

164
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,320
Of course, I have already hit a home run
and now I have to start over?

165
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:56,000
You are sophisticated
even when you're jealous.

166
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:57,960
I'm not jealous.

167
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,400
I...

168
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,080
I...

169
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:03,320
I'm just feeling uncomfortable.

170
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,000
You're holding up your hands

171
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,880
to stop me from kissing you?

172
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,960
It was your first kiss

173
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,520
and told me to treasure it.

174
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,800
Don't act like a high school girl
who got dumped.

175
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,480
That's a bit disgusting.

176
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:00,600
Don't listen to this song.
You'll be even sadder.

177
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:03,080
You'll make Mom and Dad worry.

178
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,800
Let's go to my place.

179
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,320
I can cheer you up.

180
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,160
This is great!

181
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,200
-Right?
-It's really good!

182
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,800
-It's perfect!
-I'm glad you like it.

183
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,520
How do I adjust this one?

184
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,560
This will make it stronger.

185
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:55,800
What about this?

186
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,440
Look. Have a feel, Mrs. He.

187
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,640
-This mode is comfortable.
-Yes.

188
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:05,360
It imitates the human fist
and uses a cross method

189
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:09,320
to massage the acupoints of Fengchi,
Tianzhu and Jianjin.

190
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,480
Can you feel it?

191
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,680
It's comfortable. Really.

192
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,640
It is, right?

193
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,760
But you wouldn't let me buy it.

194
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,240
This is the latest model.

195
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,920
I must've woken up the wrong way.

196
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,200
I'll get back to sleep.

197
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,000
It's already seven. Go and wash up.

198
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,280
Why do your eyes look puffy?

199
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,280
Hey.

200
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,920
Why did you come by so early?

201
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,240
It makes me stressed.
Can you give me some space?

202
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,160
The massagers I bought
with Mrs. He arrived,

203
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,240
so I brought them here.

204
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,360
It was a bargain.
The second unit was only half price.

205
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,600
You want some space? All right.

206
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,040
Mr. and Mrs. He,
I've delivered the items. I'm leaving.

207
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,280
No way! You can't just leave!

208
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,440
You came by so early to bring them to us.

209
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,760
At least have breakfast.

210
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:02,880
I'm not hungry.

211
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:04,520
He Fanxing.

212
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:06,560
Are you making him leave?

213
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,240
No.

214
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,720
What did I teach you?

215
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,600
Whoever comes here is our guest.

216
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:19,920
No guests in my house
shall leave with empty stomachs!

217
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,160
Don't go.

218
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:23,840
-Stay and eat.
-All right.

219
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,200
I can't leave now.

220
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,240
Enjoy your meal!

221
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,080
Mrs. He, I'll lend you a hand.

222
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,400
No need, Luming.

223
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:48,280
Have a seat. Chat with Mr. He.

224
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,360
Actually,

225
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:53,680
I always take simple meals
when I'm busy with work.

226
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:57,320
If not for the distance,
I'd love to eat here every day.

227
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,280
That's great, Luming.

228
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,840
Come over on the weekends
when you're not working.

229
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,080
We'll eat hotpot.

230
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,480
-Hotpot?
-Yes.

231
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:08,400
-He makes really delicious mutton balls.
-Really?

232
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:11,720
When Fanxing was little,
we weren't really well off.

233
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,720
We couldn't afford much mutton.

234
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,600
But the fragrance
of the cooked mutton balls

235
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,080
would fill the house.

236
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:23,360
Many kids would find an excuse
to come by and play.

237
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,640
But they'd block the door
and wouldn't let them in.

238
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:29,280
How naughty.

239
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:36,240
<i>It's true that numbness
comes with repeated betrayal.</i>

240
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:37,960
Mom.

241
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,240
I'll skip the meal. I have things to do.

242
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,160
This is...

243
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:43,360
Canyang.

244
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,080
This is Luming. Your sister's good friend.

245
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,160
-I've heard about you.
-Nice to meet you.

246
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,640
Let's eat next time.

247
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,920
-I have to go.
-Sure.

248
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,160
-Bye.
-Take care.

249
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,560
Why is he rushing?

250
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,040
He's busy.

251
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,640
-Eat up, Luming.
-Okay.

252
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:04,880
-Morning.
-Morning.

253
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,160
-Morning.
-Morning.

254
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,400
Ms. Bai.

255
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,800
Ms. Bai,
why are so many people absent today?

256
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:21,120
I got calls this morning.
Three of them suddenly fell sick.

257
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,200
One person's sister is in labor.

258
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,320
And another two were in a crash.

259
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,600
What a coincidence.

260
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:30,240
The Exhibition Hall

261
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,160
is holding a grand career fair today.

262
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:35,800
I saw some of them
printing their resume yesterday.

263
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:37,800
Everyone knows

264
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:41,080
that Mr. Li's idea for
an independent operation was rejected.

265
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,320
Those who think that they'd be dismissed

266
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,560
are already looking for another job.

267
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,520
Come with me.

268
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:00,760
All right. No problem.

269
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,720
See you this afternoon. Bye.

270
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,760
Jin.

271
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,520
I managed to get a client.

272
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,040
Are you free this afternoon?

273
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,440
Are you passing him over to me?

274
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:20,840
Of course.

275
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:23,320
But it's all up to you to close the deal.

276
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,440
That's for sure!

277
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,200
Here's the thing.

278
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,600
The company wants you to stay.

279
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,960
Because your designs
have a personal touch.

280
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:42,360
You're quick to understand
new materials and technologies

281
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,080
from abroad.

282
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,960
You also apply them adequately
in your designs.

283
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,800
When the company merges with Aijia,

284
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,360
we'll need new blood.

285
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,120
So

286
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,240
if you stay, you'll be a full-timer.

287
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,280
Aijia will definitely offer better pay
to their designers

288
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,480
compared to Amazing Decoration.

289
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,280
Do you want me to stay?

290
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,720
I'm only conveying the message.

291
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,480
It's yours to decide.

292
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:20,520
But of course,

293
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:23,240
if you choose to leave,

294
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,520
you can be our freelancer.

295
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:33,720
In that case,

296
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:36,040
we'll still meet.

297
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,200
That's unnecessary.

298
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Yes.

299
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:43,960
It's unnecessary indeed.

300
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,840
And you're preparing for the TOEFL exam
and to study abroad.

301
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,880
You'll be busy.

302
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,400
Okay, I'll tell the manager.

303
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,560
I told you I'm not studying abroad.

304
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:03,560
You've been preparing for it.
Why won't you go?

305
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,120
It's a personal matter.

306
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,080
I don't have to tell you.

307
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,560
I got it.

308
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,920
You'll quit as planned then.

309
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,480
If there's nothing else, you may leave.

310
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,360
The cups are here.

311
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:38,400
What cups?

312
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,440
Those we made on May 20.

313
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,640
They've been delivered to me.

314
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:44,680
I'll bring them to you.

315
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,080
Throw them away.

316
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,280
They'll be thrown anyway.

317
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,480
Fine. I will throw them away.

318
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,520
<i>Because I feel pain,</i>

319
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,760
<i>I'm blindly stabbing the person
who caused me pain.</i>

320
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,080
<i>But after stabbing him,</i>

321
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:24,920
<i>the one who suffers most</i>

322
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,360
<i>is myself.</i>

323
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,120
Why are you alone?

324
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,200
Where's your suitor?

325
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:01,000
I'm hiding here to get some peace.

326
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,320
But nosy people are everywhere.

327
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:06,760
What's the matter?

328
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,680
You're not getting along?

329
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,320
Not exactly.

330
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:18,160
A man like me has nothing
to complain about Qingqing.

331
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:19,480
She's young,

332
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,400
kind and charming.

333
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,120
Anyone would think

334
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,000
that I'm one lucky bastard.

335
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:30,800
Even I thought
that I would easily fall for her.

336
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,040
But...

337
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,120
Why don't I have any feelings for her?

338
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,480
If we could choose who we love,

339
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,240
there would be nothing
to glorify about love.

340
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:51,120
I'd better make things clear
with Qingqing soon.

341
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:54,800
Someone like me doesn't deserve her time.

342
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,400
You're right.

343
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:02,760
Perhaps, all women
don't like wasting time.

344
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,200
You're the happy one.

345
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,600
You and Ms. He are admirable.

346
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,840
A secret office romance.

347
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:13,640
How exciting.

348
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:17,080
Ms. He is a catch.

349
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:19,320
But her social circle is small.

350
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,640
She has very few friends.

351
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,760
Otherwise, a brat like you
wouldn't have lucked out.

352
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:29,800
Why am I talking to someone
who's madly in love?

353
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,080
This is just torture.

354
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,680
Unless I win
a five-million-dollar lottery,

355
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,920
I doubt I'll ever be happy.

356
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,640
I got dumped.

357
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,760
Are you crazy? You're sitting here?

358
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,120
I can't see the board from the back.

359
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,600
There are three students in the front row.

360
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,200
Let's applaud
for their attentiveness in class.

361
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:38,600
Enough.

362
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,160
Right, before I start,

363
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,560
here's a brief on the upcoming test.

364
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,480
In a group of three,

365
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:48,960
analyze any famous painting or sculpture

366
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:52,080
with the modern art collection value
and your own insight.

367
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,600
Do not copy from Baidu.

368
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:55,920
I'll know it.

369
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,280
Let's begin.

370
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,000
Let's go. We're free this afternoon.

371
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,360
Let's play <i>Dancing Stage</i>.

372
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,120
What are you on about?

373
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,400
We must prepare for our upcoming test.

374
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,960
Which painting should we choose?

375
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,920
Others will surely choose paintings
from the European Renaissance.

376
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,440
What a bore.

377
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,760
So how about paintings

378
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,200
from Zhang Daqian or Xu Beihong?

379
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,520
Whatever. We can get information on Baidu.

380
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,400
Just put them together
and say how you appreciate the painting.

381
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,160
No way. Professor He will notice that.

382
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:34,840
He's just scaring us.

383
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,400
Impossible.

384
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,040
Professor He knows a lot.

385
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:40,920
If the students can find it on Baidu,
so can he.

386
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,920
And I must get first place for this test.

387
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:48,520
I'll make sure that Professor He
sees me in a new light

388
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:51,280
and stops thinking that I'm a fool.

389
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,160
He's the foolish one.

390
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:58,120
Whenever he stands
on the podium and smiles,

391
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:00,080
he charms all the girls.

392
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:01,360
He's a dream guy.

393
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:04,920
But when his mom chased him
with a feather duster at home,

394
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,720
he looked really funny.

395
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,080
So funny.

396
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:15,960
Why are you staring at me?

397
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,960
Yuan Song was dumped. Did you know that?

398
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:22,680
Yes.

399
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:23,960
Are you not pursuing him?

400
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:29,640
Let's not disturb him
when he's feeling down.

401
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:31,960
Melon.

402
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:35,040
Something's wrong with you.

403
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,800
We both know you best.

404
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,120
All you care about is love.

405
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:43,760
When you were courting Yuan Song,
you kept talking about him.

406
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,760
The tides have turned.

407
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,440
You're into Professor He now?

408
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,760
How could you keep it a secret?

409
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:06,080
Why didn't I notice it before?

410
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,840
Are you a secret agent?

411
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,800
Why are you hiding here?

412
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,440
Who do you work for? Speak!

413
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:17,720
Enough. It has been so many days,
but you won't stop.

414
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:18,960
Just cut it out.

415
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:22,280
Seeing you reminds me of the lies
you and He Fanxing told me.

416
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:26,320
I still can't accept the fact
that they were together.

417
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:28,560
They've already closed the chapter.

418
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:31,760
And there's a man called Ye
courting Fanxing now.

419
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:35,080
Forget the bad past and move on.

420
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,160
I met him at home.

421
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:39,840
He looked familiar.
I think I've seen him somewhere.

422
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:43,360
Anyone's fine but Yuan Song.

423
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:45,800
My student almost became
my brother-in-law.

424
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:48,240
Ridiculous! I'll lose my pride!

425
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,080
So that's all you care about.

426
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,160
Of course.

427
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,160
I thought you were better than that.

428
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:04,800
Hello, Ms. Cai. What now?

429
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:08,800
<i>Professor He,
I have a question about relationships.</i>

430
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,320
<i>Can we meet for a chat?</i>

431
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,120
Relationship problems?

432
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,720
I'm at Professor Song's office.

433
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,880
Do you want to talk to her about this?

434
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:21,800
-Was that Cai Minmin from my class?
-Yes.

435
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:24,080
-What's the matter?
-I don't know. She hung up.

436
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,480
Hey.

437
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:31,040
Since when did you two get so close?

438
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,560
Let me tell you.

439
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,400
Don't you learn from your sister.

440
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:36,160
What do you mean by that?

441
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:38,520
My sister isn't as sensible as me.

442
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,280
She's just simpleminded and fun to tease.

443
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:44,080
All right.

444
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:51,440
Jotting down notes from Weibo?

445
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:53,920
Collecting materials for your book?

446
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:56,800
Materials? I sure am.

447
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:09,800
KOUKOU123, PHOTO SHARING

448
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:16,640
FANFAN LOVES DANCING, PHOTO SHARING

449
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,920
-Professor He.
-Yes?

450
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,120
Want a drink? My treat.

451
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,280
I don't want anything.

452
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:36,360
Why do you look so listless?

453
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:39,760
Right, didn't you have
a relationship problem?

454
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:42,560
Tell me. See if I can help you out.

455
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,120
-Professor He.
-Yes.

456
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,120
I would like to confirm something
with you.

457
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:53,000
Can you please put up your hand?

458
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,040
Like this.

459
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:34,760
Cai Minmin.

460
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,080
Hey!

461
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:41,640
What are you doing?

462
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:43,840
Thank you, Professor He.

463
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:27,320
-We want something good for dinner.
-That's right.

464
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:28,960
What do you want?

465
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,000
-Anything expensive.
-Ms. He!

466
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:33,560
Yuan Song is leaving next week.

467
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:35,920
He'll buy us dinner
and we'll go to karaoke.

468
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:38,960
We're throwing him a farewell party.

469
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,480
You go ahead. I'm not going.

470
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:46,280
No way.
It's not a farewell without the boss.

471
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,000
That's right. You must go.

472
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,280
Come on.

473
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,920
It's not like nobody wants you there.

474
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:02,240
Or do you have something on?

475
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,520
No. I'll go.

476
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:07,320
Karaoke is on me.

477
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:18,000
<i>You want to celebrate
Your regained freedom</i>

478
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:20,960
<i>So you're partying with friends</i>

479
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:26,280
<i>For the friendship we've always cherished</i>

480
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:28,360
<i>Let's work hard for it</i>

481
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:32,920
<i>He says he wants to move
To the furthest planet</i>

482
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:35,560
<i>For a holiday without love</i>

483
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:41,840
<i>To feast without worries</i>

484
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:46,120
<i>Let's go now</i>

485
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:50,520
<i>Let's be true to our feelings</i>

486
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:53,280
<i>Cry when we're sad</i>

487
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,720
<i>Sing when there's a song</i>

488
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:57,600
<i>Fill the emptiness in our hearts</i>

489
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:01,800
-Take the mic!
<i>-Join the heartbreak fan club</i>

490
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:05,640
<i>Party all night long</i>

491
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,880
<i>We'll become kings and queens</i>

492
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:12,440
<i>Who will sing the next song first?</i>

493
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:13,520
<i>Have a malva nut</i>

494
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:16,520
<i>Join the heartbreak fan club</i>

495
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:19,960
-<i>Fill it with happiness</i>
-I'll go buy some snacks.

496
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:24,520
<i>Our singing will drown out the sadness</i>

497
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:27,400
<i>Fast or slow, you're good at every song...</i>

498
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:37,920
You said you were paying.

499
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,640
I'll take whatever I want.

500
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:40,760
All right.

501
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:43,520
Are you and Mr. Ye doing good?

502
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:47,200
-He's not my boyfriend.
-Maybe he'll be one day.

503
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:50,120
Can you talk nicely?

504
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,520
Can I still court him?

505
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:54,680
That's your business.

506
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,720
Can you still help me court him?

507
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:02,920
What? Not anymore?

508
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,040
Cong Xiao.

509
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,080
I'll tell you one last time.

510
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,640
I really meant it when I helped you then.

511
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:11,560
I don't owe you nor have I wronged you.

512
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:12,720
You're not the victim.

513
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:15,360
I don't need you to thank me,

514
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:17,480
but you have no reason to blame me.

515
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:19,760
Get it? It's unfair to me.

516
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:20,920
I know!

517
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:22,280
So I'm sorry.

518
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:23,800
It's fine.

519
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:28,720
Do you accept my apology?

520
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:34,480
We're back on good terms then.

521
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,320
So consider this settled.

522
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:37,600
Don't regret it.

523
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,400
-You...
-What about me?

524
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:42,520
I'm still quite sad.

525
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:45,080
As a friend, you should comfort me.

526
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:48,880
So I'll eat until you drop!

527
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,000
Which one costs more?

528
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,520
That's your apology?

529
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,600
Ms. He, please pay here.

530
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:07,480
That day, when I was eating
with Chang Huan and Qingqing,

531
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:08,880
I suddenly realized

532
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,840
that my place when we were together

533
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:15,520
was the same as yours
when you were with me and Mr. Ye.

534
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,480
Stuck in the middle.

535
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,120
How awkward.

536
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,360
We're not the same.

537
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:25,760
I only found out later.

538
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:28,960
Unlike you who pretended not to know.

539
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:32,160
I thought you enjoyed

540
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:35,400
ambiguous relationships like me.

541
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:39,080
That's why you played dumb
and agreed to matchmake us

542
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:40,720
because I forced you to,

543
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,640
but you actually weren't happy about it.

544
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,280
I don't like being ambiguous.

545
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:47,440
And I'm not like you.

546
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,960
You're a hypocritical masochist.

547
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:51,400
That's why

548
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,680
yours was an unintentional mistake.

549
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,920
I was the shameless one.

550
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,120
I didn't want him,

551
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,000
but I wouldn't let him go either.

552
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,160
What have I become?

553
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,800
You have the guts to say that out loud.

554
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:11,560
Isn't this the dark side of your heart?

555
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,240
That's right.

556
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:16,040
These are words
I wouldn't even say in my dreams.

557
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:19,520
Perhaps I felt terrible.

558
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:22,000
I never wanted them together.

559
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:26,200
Why don't you just follow your heart then?

560
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,800
Put aside your marriage partner criteria.

561
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:32,800
Since you have feelings for Chang Huan,

562
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,040
why make it hard for two people?

563
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,680
But he's not a good catch.

564
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:41,360
He's paying off
a two-room suburban house loan.

565
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:43,880
He has a two-hour daily subway commute.

566
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:47,120
He is stingy, unambitious and lazy.

567
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,680
It's okay if we just date.

568
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:50,720
But to marry him? Think about it.

569
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,680
His parents are from a small town
and he's their only son.

570
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:56,920
They would want a grandson
to carry on the family name.

571
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:59,960
If I were to give birth to a girl,
they'd want a second child.

572
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,280
But we wouldn't be able to afford that.

573
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:05,160
So we can only live a frugal life.

574
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:08,360
I won't even be able to afford
any skincare products, nice clothes

575
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:09,920
or jewelry.

576
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:12,760
I would look like a 50-year-old
at the age of 35.

577
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:14,640
When I attend class reunions,

578
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,800
others would pity me.

579
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,680
My kid wouldn't want me
at parents' meetings.

580
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:24,120
No wonder people say that

581
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:27,960
when a boy is thinking
whether to hold a girl's hand,

582
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:32,000
the girl would have already thought about
their whole lives together.

583
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:37,280
My parents are poor.
They aren't on good terms.

584
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:39,160
So they're always fighting.

585
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:41,120
I don't want to be like them.

586
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:44,800
Nothing is wrong
with your criteria for a husband.

587
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:47,600
Isn't it? So what are you waiting for?

588
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:50,560
If you're smart enough,
accept Ye Luming quickly.

589
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:53,240
He's a great marriage partner.

590
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:55,680
I'm not in a hurry to get married.

591
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,440
Why not?

592
00:39:58,120 --> 00:39:59,400
Why should I?

593
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:03,000
I enjoy staying single as I am now.

594
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:05,440
Fall in love, date around.

595
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:06,920
Go with the flow.

596
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:10,000
You can wait, but not your womb.

597
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,920
You'll reach advanced maternal age
in a few years' time.

598
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,280
I already am.

599
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:17,960
Advanced maternal age now,
a high-risk mother later.

600
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:21,320
If you miss out on Ye Luming,
you'll reach menopause.

601
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:23,880
I'll adopt a child then.

602
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:31,160
You're old enough.

603
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,480
Don't act like
an 18-year-old innocent girl.

604
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,880
There are some young people

605
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,880
acting like a 60-year-old lady
who has divorced thrice.

606
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:41,920
Help me get Ye Luming then.

607
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,480
Find your own way.

608
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:00,440
<i>Let's be together forever</i>

609
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:05,000
<i>Spend the rest of your life with me</i>

610
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:08,800
<i>Yesterday's the past</i>

611
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:11,320
<i>Tomorrow, more memories await</i>

612
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:15,480
<i>Today, you'll be marrying me</i>

613
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:19,360
<i>Today, you'll be marrying me</i>

614
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:22,080
<i>Today, you'll be marrying me</i>

615
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:26,000
<i>Today, you'll be marrying me</i>

616
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:27,440
-You're back.
-Nice!

617
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:32,040
-These are from Ms. He.
-These are all my favorites!

618
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,640
"ELOPE TO THE MOON"

619
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:39,640
Hey!

620
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:42,920
Cong Xiao, a song for you and Chang Huan.
Your signature song.

621
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:50,240
<i>-Actually, you...</i>
-Gosh!

622
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:56,040
I wanted to increase the volume,
but I accidentally skipped it instead.

623
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:59,520
Cong Xiao, I'm sorry.

624
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:01,560
This is also my song.

625
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:04,880
I don't know this song.

626
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:18,320
I know!

627
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:19,960
I'll sing Show Lo's parts.

628
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:24,000
<i>It's you, stop hesitating</i>

629
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:26,120
<i>Let's play a game</i>

630
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:47,960
