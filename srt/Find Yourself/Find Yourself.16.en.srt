1
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,840
Triples with a single card.

2
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,400
Bomb!

3
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,640
I'm home.

4
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,240
Hello, Yuan Song. Sorry for intruding.

5
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,920
Big Head here suggested to surprise you.

6
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,440
Right, we couldn't do anything about it.

7
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,080
What is wrong with the two of you?

8
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,200
You guys continue.
I'm going to change my clothes.

9
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,800
You're finally home.

10
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:40,080
I was taking out the trash
and ran into them outside.

11
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,160
Why did you say that you were a maid?

12
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,160
I didn't say that,

13
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,480
but look at how I am dressed.

14
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,400
They just assumed that I was one.

15
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,760
I couldn't tell them
that I was your girlfriend.

16
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,560
It was so awkward.

17
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,680
It will be awkward
when they find out later,

18
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:57,040
especially when you have told them
that you're the maid.

19
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,280
Then...

20
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,040
I am old. I can't think straight!

21
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,600
I can't process that much at a time.

22
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,880
Still, you shouldn't have said that.

23
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,480
-What should I do?
-Yuan Song!

24
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,920
Are you done?

25
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,200
All right.

26
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,200
Let's settle the current issue first.

27
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,600
Get out there.

28
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:16,760
What about you?

29
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,720
What can I do?

30
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,280
I'm the maid,

31
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,840
so I should continue cleaning.

32
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,360
Go entertain your classmates.

33
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,560
Just go!

34
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,240
Why didn't you tell me
that you were coming?

35
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,840
We wanted to give you a surprise

36
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,600
and try our luck
in meeting your girlfriend.

37
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,200
Didn't Professor He meet her yesterday?

38
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:52,280
But all we saw was the maid when we came.

39
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,840
When did you see Professor He?

40
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,480
Last night,

41
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:02,200
Cai Minmin slept at his place.

42
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,800
How did that happen?

43
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,920
It's a sad story.

44
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,240
I don't want to remember it.

45
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,920
Anyway, just take it literally.

46
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:21,040
He just took me in for a night.

47
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,080
Right!

48
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,640
The noodles his mom made
were super delicious!

49
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,440
I wanted to have breakfast as well,
but he ruthlessly threw me out.

50
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,960
He really is a nice guy.

51
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,520
I wouldn't say that he's a nice guy.

52
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,840
More like he has an innocent side.

53
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:42,480
Maybe he really likes me.

54
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:49,480
Is the maid doing her job properly?

55
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,960
There is no way.
Professor He prefers mature women.

56
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,760
It doesn't matter.

57
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:59,360
Men love both gorgeous ladies
and sweet girls.

58
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,240
Right.

59
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,800
Something really funny happened as well.

60
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,160
When I was brushing my teeth
in the bathroom,

61
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,160
Professor He's sister rushed in!

62
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,920
She wanted to borrow a razor
to shave her legs.

63
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,320
He was so shocked!

64
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:27,160
Ma'am, can you get us more tea?

65
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,120
Thank you.

66
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,800
You're not here to serve tea.

67
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,400
Leave when you're done.

68
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,360
Okay.

69
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,200
You guys have fun.

70
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,440
The maid is so weird.

71
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,080
She was sneaking around like a thief.

72
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,480
It was so weird.

73
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,840
Hey, Yuan Song!

74
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,120
Why don't we play three-card poker?

75
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,760
You can start without me.
I forgot to pay her.

76
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,280
-What?
-What?

77
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,960
Why did you come out?

78
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:20,880
Your class--

79
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,280
Why are you looking at me like that?

80
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,840
Do you want to bite me?

81
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,520
I have changed my mind.

82
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,760
I will quit the internship.

83
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,800
I want to announce our relationship.

84
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,960
Are you crazy?

85
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:18,120
If you want to pull such a crazy stunt,
leave me out of it.

86
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,720
It's crazier to keep this a secret.

87
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:22,800
You're not even married,
so why should you feel guilty?

88
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,120
Today is not the right time for this.

89
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,080
You're right.

90
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,600
But why did I hide you yesterday?

91
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,080
So what if Professor He finds out?

92
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,880
If he wants to beat me up, let him.

93
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,800
I like you.
It's not something to be ashamed of.

94
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,800
Does it have to be like this?

95
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,040
Is there no room for negotiation?

96
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,240
No room for negotiation.

97
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,600
All right, I understand.

98
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,480
Do whatever you wish.

99
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,240
Let go of me first.

100
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,520
Men and women

101
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,840
are from two different nations

102
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,560
and there is no interpreter.

103
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,680
We don't understand each other at all.

104
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,520
My wife and I are having a cold war.

105
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,600
She treats me like air
and refuses to cook for me.

106
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,320
I can only take my daughter out
for her favorite fried chicken.

107
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:44,200
An eight-year-old kid
having fried chicken every day...

108
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,520
Can you imagine how happy she is?

109
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,120
She said that
I'm the best dad in the world.

110
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,720
If I divorced her mom,
she would surely want to stay with me.

111
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:06,760
My wife also said that
if I don't admit my mistake,

112
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:09,240
she will go back to her parents' place
and leave our daughter to me.

113
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,040
She is so unreasonable!

114
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,520
Can't I discipline my son?

115
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,400
She spoiled him too much.

116
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:18,200
That's why he never listens to us now.

117
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,680
If we ask too much, he gets annoyed.

118
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,200
If we ignore him,
he will live like a beggar.

119
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:26,440
Can't he just behave and listen to me?

120
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,920
Just like your Minmin.

121
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,240
She is such a lovely kid.

122
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,400
Stop.

123
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,680
Minmin is a dawdler.

124
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,840
Her family is rich,
so she should just be a dawdler.

125
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,000
Her only hobby is spending money.

126
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,240
Your family must have done great deeds.

127
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,880
Anyway,

128
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,080
Minmin is my daughter's role model.

129
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:51,200
When my daughter turns 18,
I'll leave her to Minmin.

130
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:55,120
Let Minmin teach her how to spend money.

131
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,320
I'm just afraid...

132
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,680
I'm just afraid that
she would go astray like her brother.

133
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,840
Whoever tries to be your son
truly deserves pity.

134
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,560
Have you tried it?

135
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,200
Are you trying to take advantage of me?

136
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,560
If you were to be my dad,

137
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,760
my sister would cry with you every day.

138
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:22,520
You're someone who buys companies easily,

139
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:26,080
so don't complain
in front of the poor like us.

140
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,760
Or else, I can't help
but to gloat and laugh.

141
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,520
Laugh?

142
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,360
Can you still laugh?

143
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,920
Are you and the woman you like together?

144
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,560
She asked me out
to play badminton on Saturday.

145
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,160
What does it mean?

146
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,960
It means she likes sports.

147
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,960
We saved 120 yuan
by using those 6 vouchers.

148
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,560
Chang Huan, you're really frugal!

149
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,760
He has always been a cheapskate.

150
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,560
Am I a cheapskate?

151
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:08,040
Didn't I just treat pigs to a barbecue?

152
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,600
Did you hear that? He called you a pig.

153
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,680
My zodiac animal is a pig after all.

154
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,840
But you ate too little just now.

155
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:18,040
I kept eating everything by myself.

156
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,200
I'll be playing badminton later,
so I can't eat too much.

157
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,840
Will you be playing badminton
with a blind date?

158
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,680
That's quite interesting.

159
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,400
Why aren't there any cabs here?

160
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,280
Chang Huan.

161
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,800
Since we're free in the evening,

162
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,160
why don't we play badminton as well?

163
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,920
It will help with digestion.

164
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,160
She's going on a blind date.

165
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,320
Do we really want to be there?

166
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,840
We'll just stay on the side
and pretend that we're strangers.

167
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,600
We can evaluate the guy for her too.

168
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:52,320
Cong Xiao, we won't disturb you.

169
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,320
You don't mind, right?

170
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,960
Of course I do.

171
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,440
-Qingqing.
-Yes?

172
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,640
You like to play video games, right?

173
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,840
There is an Internet café right ahead.

174
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:04,960
Their computers are good.

175
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,520
Just us two?

176
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:10,160
Well, both of us can form a team.

177
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:13,480
Sure, but I have never played
on a computer before,

178
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,880
-so you'll have to teach me.
-Okay.

179
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,560
It's very easy to master.

180
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:17,600
All right.

181
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,320
My cab is here, so I'm leaving first.

182
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,080
-Bye.
-Bye.

183
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,600
Good luck!

184
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,880
Let's go to the Internet café.

185
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,160
Come on!

186
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,080
Hey.

187
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,120
Fanxing!

188
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,440
-You're here.
-Yes.

189
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,200
-Did you bring your sportswear?
-Yes.

190
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,680
Do I have the smell of barbecue on me?

191
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,200
Only a bit.

192
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,160
Thank goodness I brought perfume.

193
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,000
Where's the changing room?

194
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,080
Over there.

195
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,400
-I'll go get changed.
-Okay.

196
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,880
-Hey.
-Hey.

197
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:26,040
Didn't we agree on 3:30 p.m.?

198
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,480
It's just 3:00 p.m.

199
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,160
I don't like having people waiting for me,

200
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,400
so I'm usually early.

201
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,320
I guess you're also the same.

202
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,480
Your outfit...

203
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:43,120
The men's design looked good,
so I decided to buy one too.

204
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,280
What's wrong?

205
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:47,160
Nothing, it looks nice.

206
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:51,200
-I'll go rent a racket.
-Wait. I already did that.

207
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,440
They're over there.

208
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,480
You rented three rackets?

209
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,920
Yes, I ran into my colleague
when I arrived.

210
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,280
She was alone.

211
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:06,080
So I thought we could play together.

212
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,800
Did she come here alone to play badminton?

213
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:12,760
Yes.

214
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,360
Why not?

215
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,040
Do you feel hot?

216
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,880
Why are you so flushed?

217
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,200
It is a bit hot.

218
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,800
I was warming up.

219
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,400
Fanxing.

220
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,520
Come here.

221
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,160
Let me introduce you two.

222
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,760
This is my colleague, Cong Xiao.

223
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,720
This is my best friend, Ye Luming.

224
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,800
He's the boss of Minglu,
the ad agency that's working with us.

225
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,080
Hello, Ms. Cong.

226
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,680
Hello, Mr. Ye. Just call me Cong Xiao.

227
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,480
Fanxing told me you came alone
to play badminton.

228
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,240
Yes, I'm not good at it.

229
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,840
So I usually hire a coach.

230
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,040
Is that so?

231
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:07,360
Why would she be alone? She hires a coach.

232
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,920
He Fanxing, you are really bad at this.

233
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,200
You're back so soon.

234
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,280
-Yes.
-Did you get the chives?

235
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,400
What?

236
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:26,880
Right...

237
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,080
I was out to buy some chives.

238
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:32,160
I only remembered that it was a vegetable,

239
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,520
so I bought some Chinese cabbage.

240
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:38,400
If you have forgotten,
you could have given me a call.

241
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,920
I left my phone at home.

242
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,720
Could you have Alzheimer's?

243
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:48,800
Forget it.

244
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,400
Let's have Chinese cabbage dumplings then.

245
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:53,600
No, Fanxing loves the chives filling.

246
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,640
Just forget it.

247
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,320
She's playing badminton with Luming.

248
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,600
She might not come back for dinner.

249
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,440
She's playing badminton with Luming?

250
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:06,200
I was hoping that
they would make some progress.

251
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:09,640
To my surprise, she actually asked him out
to play badminton.

252
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,960
Badminton?

253
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,640
Why do you think I let her learn badminton
in the first place?

254
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,080
I'm sorry. I'll go easy on you next time.

255
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,760
Don't go easy on me.

256
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,360
That was just a slipup.

257
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,280
Have you rested enough?

258
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,000
Sure.

259
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,320
Bring it on!

260
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,200
Thank you!

261
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,280
Thank you!

262
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,840
-Here you go.
-Please hold on.

263
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:34,480
Got it.

264
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,080
Hey.

265
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,360
So your WeChat username is also Cong Xiao?

266
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,920
Yes, because many clients of mine
are also on WeChat.

267
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,040
Is that so?

268
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:46,520
Hello?

269
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:47,880
What?

270
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,560
Can't it be tomorrow?

271
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,120
All right, I'll be right there.

272
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,240
All right.

273
00:18:58,840 --> 00:18:59,720
What should I do?

274
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,360
I was supposed to eat with you,

275
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,960
but something came up.

276
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,440
Why don't you two go instead?

277
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,800
-We can do it another day.
-No.

278
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,240
It will be my pleasure
to dine with a beauty.

279
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,040
Let's go change then.

280
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:19,440
-Okay.
-She doesn't need to change.

281
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,720
Just help me get my bag.

282
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:26,880
All right.

283
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,560
I'll go get ice cream.

284
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:32,800
Come here.

285
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,640
Be gentle! Wait!

286
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,360
Give me your phone.

287
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,360
Let me see your call log.

288
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,560
I'm sorry.

289
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:48,920
Well done.

290
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,120
You know that I like someone,

291
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:53,560
but you still set up a blind date
without telling me.

292
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:55,920
This isn't a blind date!

293
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,360
This is just making a new friend.

294
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,280
Isn't it a blind date for her?

295
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,520
I'm so disappointed in you.

296
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,040
Hey.

297
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,960
You went to play badminton with Luming.

298
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,640
Why didn't you just have dinner with him?

299
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,000
We just didn't.

300
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:31,680
Hey.

301
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:36,080
Was it because you went too hard on him
during the game?

302
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,720
Hey, you have to remember
what your mom said.

303
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:42,640
"You have to go easy on others!

304
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:43,640
It's not a competition!

305
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:46,680
Give them a chance
or you'll end up playing alone!"

306
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,160
-Mr. He.
-Yes?

307
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:55,880
It's so rare for you to agree with me.

308
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,200
Really?

309
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,880
I lost.

310
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,360
I lost on purpose.

311
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,720
Wait.

312
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,880
You lost on purpose?

313
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:12,640
Yes.

314
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,160
Were you trying to please him?

315
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,200
Why would I do that?

316
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,240
I set him up with a friend.

317
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:21,800
You've met her.

318
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,440
She's my colleague, Cong Xiao.

319
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,720
You introduced Cong Xiao to him?

320
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,360
Yes.

321
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,200
Goodness, Cong Xiao is so pretty.

322
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,680
She can take her pick of men.

323
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:37,400
Don't forget that
you're the one celebrating Singles' Day!

324
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,360
It is no longer called Singles' Day.

325
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,280
Isn't it called Shopping Day nowadays?

326
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:42,760
Don't interrupt me!

327
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,800
What I am trying to say is...

328
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,840
You don't even have a boyfriend,

329
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:53,440
yet you've become a matchmaker
and for that colleague of all people.

330
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,280
As the old saying goes,

331
00:21:56,680 --> 00:22:00,160
"After the wedding,
the matchmaker is forgotten."

332
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,760
If they have a happy ending,
it is to your credit.

333
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,280
If they don't,

334
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,880
they'll curse the matchmaker.

335
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,120
They'll curse you every day!

336
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,440
Just let them curse, I don't care.

337
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,120
Why are you so stupid?

338
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:18,200
Why can't you think carefully?

339
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:20,280
You set your colleague up!

340
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:22,400
Will it do you any good
if she has a boyfriend?

341
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,160
If Luming has a girlfriend,

342
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,640
will he still care about you?

343
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,600
He will eventually have a girlfriend.

344
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:34,400
When he does and he puts the woman
before our friendship,

345
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,200
I wouldn't want such a friend anymore.

346
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,480
You are out of your mind.

347
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,400
-Dad.
-Yes?

348
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,280
What's wrong with Mom?

349
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,600
Don't mind her.

350
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,040
-Fanxing.
-Yes?

351
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:08,080
How did everything go
with Cong Xiao and Luming

352
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,520
after they met?

353
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:12,960
Don't remind me.

354
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,280
Cong Xiao asked me to set them up,

355
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,840
so of course, she was very excited.

356
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:20,760
But Luming didn't want to meet her at all.

357
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:25,160
So I suggested playing badminton
to create an opportunity for them to meet.

358
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,960
But I offended him instead.

359
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:32,400
Well, did you apologize to him then?

360
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:33,800
Yes, I did.

361
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,400
But he was so hot-tempered
that he just stormed out.

362
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,400
I don't even dare to text him right now.

363
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,200
He is not hot-tempered.

364
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:46,520
He has such a great personality.

365
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:50,080
No matter what I post on Moments,

366
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,680
he would always give me likes.

367
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:55,200
Unlike all of you who blocked me.

368
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:59,000
Mom, if you didn't share
so many health articles,

369
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,640
I wouldn't have blocked you.

370
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,000
Did he really like your posts?

371
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,120
Yes.

372
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:09,320
Whenever he finds a good health article,
he will send it to me.

373
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:13,280
We even made a group purchase
for a foot spa tub.

374
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:14,840
A group purchase?

375
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:18,200
We each saved 50 yuan
because we bought it together.

376
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,320
I knew he was a money-minded businessman,

377
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,920
but I never thought he would do that
just for a foot tub.

378
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,200
It's called being frugal.

379
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,160
Cheapskate.

380
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:31,120
Come on, stop bickering.

381
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,480
I think this is enough since Canyang
is not coming home for dinner.

382
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,920
Let's eat these first and make more later.

383
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,200
Where's Canyang?

384
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:41,600
That student of his, Yuan Song,

385
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,200
wanted to talk to him.

386
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:45,840
So they went to the barbecue restaurant
beside the park.

387
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,240
<i>But why did I hide you yesterday?</i>

388
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:52,600
<i>So what if Professor He finds out?</i>

389
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,080
<i>If he wants to beat me up, let him.</i>

390
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,520
<i>I like you.
It's not something to be ashamed of.</i>

391
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,640
Mom, I'm not eating,
so you should eat with Dad.

392
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:01,760
I'm going out!

393
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,280
Where are you going?

394
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,160
Where are you going?

395
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:06,960
Hey, the rolling pin!

396
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,080
Seventy!

397
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:10,920
-You lost!
-Drink up!

398
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,240
-Pour it!
-Here.

399
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,080
-Bottoms up!
-Cheers!

400
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:17,200
Falling in love
causes the release of dopamine.

401
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,400
Dopamine makes you feel happy,

402
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:22,160
so being in love gives you happiness.

403
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,640
-Okay.
-All right.

404
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:26,440
But look at your sad face.

405
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:27,560
Just break up.

406
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:30,640
-You lost!
-Drink up!

407
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:34,840
Would you break up
when you're crazy about that person?

408
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,120
Of course not.

409
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:39,160
But usually, I would be the one
they would go crazy over.

410
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,320
It's the other way around for you.

411
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:42,880
At first,

412
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:45,120
I thought you wanted to hide it.

413
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,760
You didn't want to go public.

414
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,920
Surprisingly, it was her
who insisted on it.

415
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:52,920
This is very weird.

416
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,320
What's so weird about it?

417
00:25:56,040 --> 00:26:00,080
Is your girlfriend two-timing
either you or the other guy?

418
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,120
She's not.

419
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:02,400
Is she married?

420
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:08,080
You're a good catch.

421
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:10,160
There's no reason not to go public.

422
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:11,440
She's older than me.

423
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,080
Much older.

424
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,640
What's with the rolling pin?

425
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,040
What were you talking about?

426
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:26,600
Just something casual. It's not important.

427
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:28,840
Put that down and have a seat.

428
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:36,320
Why did you come outside
looking like that?

429
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,000
Don't you put on makeup
just to walk the dog?

430
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:41,840
I don't wear it to show others,
I do it for myself.

431
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,560
I didn't say that.

432
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:47,320
Waitress, two more beers.

433
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,600
All right. Coming.

434
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,320
Hey.

435
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:54,360
Dad told me you went to play badminton

436
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:57,360
with your best friend this evening.

437
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,680
I was trying to set him up with a friend.

438
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,440
That explains why you are so upset.

439
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,880
I said we're just friends.

440
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,800
-Then what's with the makeup?
-It's not for him!

441
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,560
Who is it for then? Who?

442
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:11,520
Come on, who is it for?

443
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,080
Here's your beer.

444
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:34,960
Gosh.

445
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,720
You should let your subordinate

446
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,480
pour the beer for you.

447
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,440
He's so thoughtful.

448
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,400
He Fanxing, do you see that?

449
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,680
Now that is a student of mine.

450
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:51,720
Yuan Song, I really like you.

451
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:53,880
Be my godson.

452
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,480
Are you making fun of me?

453
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,000
I was just kidding.

454
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:05,160
-You will regret it.
-What?

455
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:09,840
Look at you two.

456
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:12,200
One looks so fierce,
while the other looks so gloomy.

457
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,800
I was just trying to liven things up.

458
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,920
It is good timing that He Fanxing is here.

459
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,520
Even though she has never dated before,

460
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:20,960
she is still a woman.

461
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:24,320
She can give you some advice
from a woman's perspective.

462
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,760
-No, thank you!
-Sure!

463
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:31,120
-There's no need.
-I don't mind.

464
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:33,640
There's no need.

465
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,920
Should I call an ambulance?

466
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,200
Uncle.

467
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,640
How is it going with you and Aunt?

468
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,120
Couldn't be better.

469
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,120
She cares so much about me

470
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:51,280
that she set me up with her colleague.

471
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:00,560
What are our ancestors doing?

472
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,680
We're not even qualified to be backups.

473
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,920
We burn joss paper for them

474
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,280
and return to the ancestral home
to give offerings at year's end.

475
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,560
No alcohol for kids.

476
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,280
What do you mean by "we"?

477
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:15,960
What's wrong?

478
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,320
I went to his house today.

479
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:22,360
But I think he was in a bad mood.

480
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:24,120
He was so weird.

481
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,360
Something felt wrong.

482
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:28,240
Maybe he broke up with his girlfriend.

483
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:30,320
If that was the case,

484
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,240
then it would be great news.

485
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,400
It's not like that.

486
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:38,160
We wanted to pay him a surprise visit,

487
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,960
but we didn't see his girlfriend.

488
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:41,560
We only saw the...

489
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,200
What's wrong now, Cai Minmin?

490
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,280
It can't be!

491
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,520
No way!

492
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:57,400
I must be wrong!

493
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,200
It's impossible!

494
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,280
Calm down.

495
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:03,000
Can't you talk properly?

496
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,240
You're scaring me.

497
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,920
Uncle, can I ask you a question?

498
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:12,880
Ask away.

499
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:17,040
Let's say you go to a colleague's house
who lives alone and has a lover.

500
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,480
He's not at home.

501
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,840
But a lady wearing a mask and apron
who was doing chores

502
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,440
answers the door.

503
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:24,560
Who do you think that lady is?

504
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:28,560
If she looks old, then she is his mom.

505
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:31,800
If she looks young,
then she is his girlfriend.

506
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:38,960
Now that I think about it,

507
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,280
<i>she looked quite young</i>

508
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,880
<i>and had a nice figure.</i>

509
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:43,800
<i>Girlfriend it is!</i>

510
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,560
Why can't she be the maid?

511
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:49,400
Didn't you say that
the colleague wasn't home?

512
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:52,520
Who would leave a maid alone
in the house to do the chores?

513
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:55,720
You're right.

514
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,280
Why didn't I think of that?

515
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:01,920
Why would he leave the maid alone
in his house?

516
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:04,840
That was a clear giveaway!

517
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:09,400
So you and your classmates
went to his place

518
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:12,120
and mistook his girlfriend for the maid?

519
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,360
That must be it.

520
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:16,040
No wonder.

521
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,800
He looked so weird when he came back.

522
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:21,160
The maid also behaved like a thief.

523
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,240
She left before finishing the chores.

524
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:25,040
He even went after her when she left,

525
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,400
saying that he forgot to pay her.

526
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,840
Everything was weird,

527
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:31,160
but it all adds up now!

528
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:34,120
Why am I so dumb?

529
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,880
She was actually quite young

530
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,640
and looked kind of pretty.

531
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,800
She had big eyes.

532
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:44,120
She's so hardworking and virtuous.

533
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:49,280
My dream guy must hate me.

534
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:52,440
I don't want him to hate me!

535
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:54,680
Why don't I just die?

536
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:02,600
Quiet.

537
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:03,800
I need to take this call.

538
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:09,880
Hello, Mrs. He.

539
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:13,080
So from a woman's perspective,

540
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:15,680
you wouldn't go public
if your boyfriend was younger?

541
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,360
-Right.
-What part is right?

542
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:20,800
Is there a problem with going public
only after we're stable?

543
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,880
Of course not,
or are you marrying her already?

544
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,000
We're very stable.

545
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:26,440
Going public is easier,
so why would you rather suffer?

546
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,120
It's about the contract.

547
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,880
This is why a company
signs contracts with clients.

548
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:33,560
Or else, one could go back on his words
just like this. Right?

549
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,680
Being in a relationship
is not like working.

550
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:38,760
A contract to a relationship is marriage
and divorce is part of it.

551
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:41,600
Aren't there employees
who finish probation early?

552
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:43,840
There are, but--

553
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:44,960
Right, there are.

554
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:46,320
Am I not good enough?

555
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,520
-You...
-They are so funny.

556
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:52,800
Enough.

557
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:56,560
Yuan Song.

558
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:59,320
It's no use if He Fanxing thinks
that you're good enough.

559
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:01,040
Why are you even arguing with her?

560
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:02,560
She's like this.

561
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,440
This is her habit as an administrator.

562
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:06,600
She doesn't know how to be flexible,

563
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:09,800
but a woman like her is rare.

564
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:12,679
Is your girlfriend
a rigid person like her?

565
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:16,080
So my conclusion is that
she doesn't love you that much.

566
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:18,840
Maybe you're right.

567
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:21,239
He Canyang!

568
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:23,840
Can you not jump to conclusions
when you don't know her?

569
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:26,360
He Fanxing, don't you have common sense?

570
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,560
Isn't it obvious?

571
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,639
In the martial arts world,
who isn't hurt by a sword?

572
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:41,440
-I'll slash you once!
-I'll slash you five times!

573
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:42,400
Drink!

574
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,320
Again.

575
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:51,520
In the martial arts world,
who isn't hurt by a sword?

576
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,400
-I'll slash you twice. Drink!
-I'll slash you once.

577
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:03,040
In the martial arts world,
who isn't hurt by a sword?

578
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:05,360
-I'll slash you four times. Drink.
-I'll slash you thrice.

579
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,240
I need to use the bathroom.

580
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,720
Isn't she fun?

581
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:47,040
She can't think straight when she's drunk.

582
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:49,840
She'll only give odd numbers
like one, three, and five.

583
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:53,440
The order has always been
three, five and one.

584
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:54,920
It's easy to beat her.

585
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,280
DONGYA

586
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,520
How I wish

587
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:09,400
I have a girlfriend
who doesn't want to go public.

588
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,960
I'M OUTSIDE. CAN YOU COME OUT?

589
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:34,840
Speak of the devil.

590
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,040
I'll be right back.

591
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:55,720
Did you come here because you thought
I would tell him something?

592
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,440
Don't worry.

593
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:59,920
I never thought of doing that.

594
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,760
I was upset,

595
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,360
so I just wanted to have dinner with him.

596
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,080
Come here.

597
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,200
I don't blame you for leaving today.

598
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:23,160
Ms. He, you're a coward.

599
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:30,320
Forget it.

600
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:31,840
What?

601
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:34,480
I don't care.

602
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:36,960
I don't care!

603
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,760
Don't you want to go public?
Then just do it!

604
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,040
I'm not afraid!

605
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,080
Everyone, look!

606
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,960
-Get together!
-Get together!

607
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,360
-Get together!
-Get together!

608
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:00,600
-Get together!
-Get together!

609
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:02,640
-Get together!
-Get together!

610
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,200
It's so interesting.

611
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,480
-How does that happen?
-Right.

612
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:36,640
Just like that.

613
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,760
It's a good massager.

614
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:39,760
It is.

615
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,120
This is really great.

616
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:42,720
The water is warmer now.

617
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,480
Right, just adjust it
to the temperature you want.

618
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:47,040
This is really nice!

619
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:48,280
Yes.

620
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,320
It is quite cooling.

621
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:54,760
Does it feel good?

622
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:56,720
Is the bigger one moving too?

623
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:59,120
Mom.

624
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,960
When it moves, the small one stops.

625
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:03,160
You're right, it does!

626
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:05,720
You're right!

627
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,120
This is really nice.

628
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,360
It's great!

629
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:11,920
It was worth the money.

630
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,320
It better be.

631
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,520
This is nice.

632
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:16,800
-I'll tell them tomorrow.
-Okay.

633
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:23,120
Not bad.

634
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,480
This is great!

635
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:28,840
-Get together!
-Get together!

636
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:31,000
-Get together!
-Get together!

637
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:36,040
No.

638
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:55,000
My goodness.

639
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:04,640
There are three modes.

640
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:07,240
You can adjust it
to the intensity you like.

641
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:11,480
Keep the water temperature
at around 40 degrees Celsius.

642
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,360
All right.

643
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:15,960
Hey.

644
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:19,400
It can massage the arches of my feet too.

645
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:21,000
Of course.

646
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:23,920
It's spinning around.

647
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,440
-Here.
-Thank you.

648
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:26,560
Here you go.

649
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,040
Thank you, I'll help myself.

650
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:29,840
-Come on. One more.
-Thank you.

651
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:31,680
Look at these dishes.

652
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:34,960
Mrs. He, you can open a restaurant
with your skills.

653
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:36,280
-Really?
-Yes.

654
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:39,720
No.

655
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:41,520
It's just some homemade dishes.

656
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:44,480
If you like them, you can come every day.

657
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:47,200
Don't just come when I call you to.

658
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:49,280
It's so good that
I want to come here every day,

659
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:52,360
but I'll have to pay you for all this.

660
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:54,680
That's not a problem!

661
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:57,040
You can pay us and come to eat every day.

662
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,560
This lady here will be very thrilled.

663
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:01,640
You!

664
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:03,320
He was teasing you.

665
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:05,280
There's no need to pay anything.

666
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:08,840
I just need to add one more pair
of chopsticks and a bowl.

667
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,120
Here you go.
I can see that you really like this.

668
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:13,720
-Here.
-Thank you.

669
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:16,760
One more.

670
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,160
It's so good.

671
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:20,320
-Try this one.
-Sure.

672
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:48,800
I'm sorry about yesterday.

673
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:50,040
Don't misunderstand.

674
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:53,360
I only came because Mrs. He invited me.

675
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:02,920
Why is everyone mad at me?

676
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:06,840
I feel like a husband in ancient times.

677
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:10,360
I have to coax the mistress
after coaxing the wife.

678
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:12,240
What are you talking about?

679
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:13,960
Who is the mistress?

680
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,320
Are you shushing me?

681
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:20,160
Who is the mistress here?

682
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:24,440
Can you stop that? I'm sorry.

683
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:26,840
I'm the mistress. All right?

684
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:31,160
The wife gets the cold shoulder,

685
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:32,840
while the mistress is pampered.

686
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,320
Do you dote on me?

687
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,040
You just want to set me up.

688
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:45,760
Did you guys

689
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:47,760
have a good dinner last night?

690
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:50,960
I took her to a seafood place

691
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:52,640
and sent her home after that.

692
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:53,920
How is that?

693
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,320
Did I make you proud?

694
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:56,600
Are you happy now?

695
00:42:58,480 --> 00:42:59,880
You're so nice.

696
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:02,240
-Thank you!
-I'm not nice!

697
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:18,840
