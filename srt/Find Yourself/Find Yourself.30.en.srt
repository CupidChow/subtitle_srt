1
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,280
I think that is just nice.

2
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,480
Aunt means your uncle's wife.

3
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
It's not right.

4
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:13,720
Then from now on, I'll call you Fanxing.

5
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,200
Okay.

6
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,640
I heard that you're dating someone.

7
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,080
I knew my aunt would sell me out.

8
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,400
You don't have to hide it.

9
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,160
When you liked your senior,

10
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,920
I was the one who worked out
your game plan.

11
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,120
Even if this guy is older than you,

12
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,960
it's not a problem.

13
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,560
The problem is where did he come from?

14
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,120
How did you move on so soon?

15
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,520
We're worried that you've met a bad guy.

16
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,960
Rest assured.
I'm familiar with his background.

17
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,040
He's very nice. I know him very well.

18
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:55,200
But our relationship isn't stable yet,

19
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,560
so I can't tell you now.

20
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,560
Why?

21
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,200
You'll know soon enough.

22
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,840
Fanxing, what do you think?

23
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,440
I think

24
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,600
it's fine.

25
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,720
Perhaps, it's not the right time
to introduce him to your family yet.

26
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,920
You're right!

27
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,040
We're just dating.

28
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,280
It's not like we're getting married.

29
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,200
Fine. I'm just concerned.

30
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,400
Hey.

31
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,320
Promise me.

32
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,880
If there's any problem,
I'll be the first to know. Okay?

33
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,680
Okay.

34
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,880
I saw Professor He at dinner last night.

35
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,760
I was shocked.

36
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,520
Then I realized,
I'm not a high school student.

37
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,880
Why should I be scared of him?

38
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,320
Aren't you two quite close?
Why are you scared?

39
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,880
It's not that I'm scared.

40
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,800
I may have bad grades,

41
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,920
but I respect my teachers.

42
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,480
That's good. Keep it up.

43
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,560
Okay.

44
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:21,600
It's only been an hour.
Do you miss me already?

45
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,640
<i>My sister saw your post.</i>

46
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,600
So what?

47
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,680
I didn't mention who I had dinner with.

48
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,760
<i>She smelled the hotpot on me.</i>

49
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,760
<i>I didn't know you posted it
to brag to your friends.</i>

50
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,520
<i>I said I ate super spicy hotpot.</i>

51
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,000
Is our cover blown then?

52
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,560
<i>Yes. It is.</i>

53
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,400
My first love has just started
and it's going to end already?

54
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:47,200
I don't care.
We're going to date, no matter what.

55
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,040
We'll break the shackles of feudalism,

56
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,800
ignore people's criticisms,
fight our families' objection,

57
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,160
and hold on until the end.

58
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,440
<i>All right, stop. I was kidding.</i>

59
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,840
<i>I said I ran into you
and even saw your boyfriend.</i>

60
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,760
<i>I'm already in the clear.</i>

61
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,920
<i>Tell your uncle we met coincidentally
if he asks.</i>

62
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,240
<i>Then we can put this behind us.</i>

63
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,560
Professor He, you're really brilliant.

64
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,520
-It's quite delicious.
-Yes.

65
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,840
Dig in.

66
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:19,840
PROFESSOR HE

67
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,520
<i>We're safe!</i>

68
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,000
Hello, Mr. Zhao.

69
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,400
Slow down.

70
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:47,600
What's the problem
with the final version of the ad?

71
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,800
What?

72
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,080
You're changing the endorser now?

73
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,720
What's the matter with you lately?

74
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,800
You didn't eat much
and kept spacing out just now.

75
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,440
Do you need to see a doctor?

76
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,640
Why are you so down?

77
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:16,480
It's so full of male hormones.

78
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,440
Should I break up with Dongyang?

79
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,880
Break up? That's ridiculous.

80
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,160
You're joking, right?

81
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,040
What do you think?

82
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,920
No way. Did he cheat too?

83
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,640
What if I'm the one cheating?

84
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,040
Did you cheat on him?

85
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,760
No.

86
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,200
You've been acting strange lately.

87
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,360
Your relationship seems to be in crisis.

88
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,800
Is it a ten-year itch?

89
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,240
It's not that serious.

90
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:56,560
Then are you not doing it anymore?

91
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,720
-That's not it.
-What is it then?

92
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,640
Nothing.

93
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,400
Forget it. Just drink your problems away.

94
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,800
Let's drink at my place.

95
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,920
I don't feel like drinking.

96
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,200
Let's shoot the matcha flavor first.

97
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,240
-Then the milk flavor. Okay?
-Sure.

98
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,960
What? The flight is delayed?

99
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,320
All right. Call me when the plane
is about to take off.

100
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,960
The flight is delayed due to bad weather.

101
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,600
He said he'd land at 8:00 a.m.

102
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,600
It's already 8:00 a.m.
He hasn't even taken off yet.

103
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,880
There's nothing we can do now.

104
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,800
We'll start when he arrives.

105
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,440
This must be aired next week.

106
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,480
Why would a celebrity

107
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,600
suddenly become an anti-alcohol ambassador
and not endorse alcohol?

108
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,480
Look at it this way.

109
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,760
Good thing we found out
before the ad was aired.

110
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,840
If we were to change the endorser
after it has aired,

111
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,320
it would be a greater loss.

112
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,640
You're right.

113
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,280
You'll have to rush them then.

114
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,080
You must air it on time next week.

115
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,800
Don't worry.

116
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:10,200
We're prepared to stay up late for nights.

117
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,160
The Besheen Liquor ad
will definitely launch on time.

118
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,360
Thanks.

119
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,320
-Have a seat.
-Okay.

120
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,600
The coffees are here!

121
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,240
Wake up, guys. Drink some coffee.

122
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,560
I don't know.
I'll probably work all night.

123
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,720
<i>You didn't eat a proper lunch.</i>

124
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,760
<i>What about dinner?</i>

125
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:00,000
Well, I tend to forget to eat
when I'm busy.

126
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,560
Go to sleep first.

127
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,480
You're finally worrying about me.

128
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,000
<i>What's there to worry about?</i>

129
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,960
<i>My colleagues at work
always work overtime too.</i>

130
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,200
<i>So do I, to work on schedule.</i>

131
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,240
He Fanxing,

132
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:20,120
you're an unromantic and awful girlfriend.

133
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,080
Hey.

134
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,680
I think you're emotionally a straight man!

135
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,280
"I'm worried about you.

136
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:29,160
Don't skip meals. Drink more hot water."

137
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,400
Can't you show such concerns?

138
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,040
<i>Then don't skip meals.</i>

139
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,920
<i>Drink more hot water.</i>

140
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,280
Bye!

141
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:40,960
Go to sleep early.

142
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:44,680
Staying up after midnight
leads to sagging organs, okay?

143
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,720
Go to bed. I have to work.

144
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,200
I'll talk to you later. Bye.

145
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,680
Thanks for coming. You're finally here.

146
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:07,840
Mr. Ye.

147
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:26,760
Here.

148
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,360
Try the dumplings in chicken soup
by Shen Hongmei.

149
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,800
I'm just a delivery girl.

150
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,400
Don't feel too touched.

151
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,600
I am touched.

152
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:39,240
Your clothes are all wet from the rain.

153
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,320
-Dry them. Don't catch a cold.
-Thanks.

154
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,320
All right.

155
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,520
I've been thinking.

156
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,160
As a girlfriend,

157
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:53,280
I should bring my boyfriend supper
at times like these.

158
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:56,760
You should?

159
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:57,960
Yes!

160
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:03,760
Forget it.

161
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,920
You're still learning.

162
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,240
At moments like these,
you should send supper indeed.

163
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,280
Try it.

164
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,360
Is it good?

165
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,560
It is.

166
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:22,000
But it's not your concern.
You just delivered it.

167
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,240
This reminds me of my teens.

168
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,600
Back then, my classmates

169
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,800
all had warm meals waiting for them
when they got home.

170
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,640
But when I get home,

171
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,040
the stove and pots are cold.

172
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,840
My sister and brother-in-law
were still working.

173
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,520
I had to cook for them.

174
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,880
After that, I went to night classes.

175
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,200
So,

176
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:59,920
high school was the time

177
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,080
when I really wanted to get married.

178
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,080
I hoped someone would be home,
waiting to eat with me.

179
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,320
High school?

180
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,800
You sure matured early.

181
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,840
Then, didn't you meet anyone

182
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,520
you wanted to marry?

183
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:21,960
After college,

184
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:25,320
I worked for two years and met someone.

185
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,920
But back then, I was too busy.

186
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,520
I had no time to date.

187
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,640
So we broke up.

188
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:35,600
Then, I started my own business.

189
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,520
I didn't have time to eat, let alone date.

190
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,000
Tell me.

191
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,240
Isn't it tough to be an adult?

192
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,240
But...

193
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,600
Didn't anyone pursue you?

194
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:52,960
What do you think?

195
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,040
But...

196
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,360
For people my age,

197
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:01,800
they're either married
or I don't like them.

198
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,280
Otherwise, it's all about qualifications.

199
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,160
Women who just started working

200
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:12,960
are too young for me.

201
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,360
We have nothing in common.

202
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,120
Do you know what they said

203
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,360
when I told them that I used
to play with mud in the province?

204
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,800
"Why did you play mud
instead of your phone?"

205
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:27,840
Exactly.

206
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,760
I told them that
there was no electricity back then.

207
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,080
There were no telephones,
let alone mobile phones.

208
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,200
And they would say,

209
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:38,600
"Why was there no electricity?
Electricity has always existed."

210
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,200
Yes, exactly!

211
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,160
I remember saying something to Yuan Song.

212
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:52,640
He said he started playing Minesweeper
when he was little.

213
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,760
Actually, I've stopped eating supper
for the past few years.

214
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,760
But I have no choice when I have to work.

215
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,400
Actually, I don't like eating supper too.

216
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:22,080
As we age,
we have to control our food intake.

217
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:26,360
Yes, it's obvious that
my metabolism is slowing down.

218
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:30,200
After I eat supper,
I have to jog intensely the next day.

219
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,320
Who's that?

220
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,080
Yuan Song.

221
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:44,880
At this hour?

222
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,240
He's on a business trip

223
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,880
to take measurements for a homestay
with another designer.

224
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,040
I wonder what's up.

225
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,320
Hello, Yuan Song.

226
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:58,640
It's so late...

227
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,200
What happened? Is he in the hospital?

228
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,400
Appendicitis? Does he need surgery?

229
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,960
Okay, hold on.
I'll check for train tickets.

230
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,280
I'll let you know.

231
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,880
Is it acute appendicitis? Who?

232
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,080
Chang Huan.

233
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:26,240
He has been sent to the ER in town.

234
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:29,640
His temperature won't go down,
so he's been taking a drip.

235
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:33,320
He was advised to return for surgery
after his fever subsides.

236
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,600
Yuan Song needs to work.

237
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,800
No one is taking care of him.
I have to go to him.

238
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,640
There's one train at past 2:00 a.m.

239
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,400
I can make it.

240
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:45,840
I have to go.

241
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,600
I'll take you to the train station.

242
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,720
There's no need. You're working.

243
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,400
-I'll take a cab.
-It's okay.

244
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:54,040
I'm not needed now. I'll drive you.

245
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,080
Did you bring your identity card?

246
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,760
-Yes.
-Let's go.

247
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,120
It's 38.8 degrees Celcius.
It dropped a bit.

248
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,240
-Keep giving him water.
-Thanks.

249
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:30,720
May I know where the patient
with appendicitis is?

250
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,200
In the transfusion room.

251
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,480
Thank you.

252
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:38,960
You're here.

253
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,280
Yes.

254
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,240
What did the doctor say?

255
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,920
After his fever subsides and stabilizes,
he needs to go for the surgery.

256
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,080
He just fell asleep.

257
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,240
I guess the pain has reduced.

258
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:01,000
I'll stay here. Go home and sleep.

259
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,000
Is the homestay you're staying at
far from here?

260
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:06,079
No, but today's work got delayed.

261
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,800
I have to cover for us both,
so I'll be working overnight anyway.

262
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:11,319
We're meeting with the owners tomorrow
to discuss the design.

263
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:15,040
After a long night, you must be hungry.

264
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:20,160
I saw some corns and peanuts
in front of the train station,

265
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,359
so I bought some.

266
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:25,520
Thank goodness. I didn't even have lunch.

267
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,680
It feels like my stomach has a hole.

268
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:34,040
It was past midnight when I called you.

269
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,880
You were still on a date?

270
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,800
How sweet.

271
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,960
What are you talking about?

272
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,400
They're working overtime.
I was visiting them.

273
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,400
Is this coriander?

274
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,840
It smells like chicken soup.

275
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:00,520
-Dumplings in chicken soup?
-Do you have a dog's nose?

276
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,000
Your mom made it, right?

277
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,120
You don't know how to make that.

278
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,800
You made curry
and almost burned my kitchen.

279
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,000
It's nice to date openly indeed.

280
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,760
It has so many benefits.

281
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,960
When will you stop mocking me about it?

282
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,440
Until you're mad.

283
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:21,720
What are you looking at?

284
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,640
I am mad.

285
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:27,960
I think you need a lesson.

286
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,160
Why are you so fierce now?

287
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,640
You weren't this way before.

288
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,200
And you wouldn't mock me.

289
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,920
Fine. We're even.

290
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,480
Don't be mad.

291
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:46,800
Go on.

292
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,560
It tastes good.

293
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,160
How is Braised Meat?

294
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:00,160
-Did he bully Baylor?
-No, he's good.

295
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,200
Don't worry.

296
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,760
Right, I met your dad

297
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,080
when I was fetching the dog the other day.

298
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:08,840
-My dad?
-Yes.

299
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,920
-He went to see me again?
-Yes.

300
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,680
He came in when I was picking up poop.

301
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,920
Did he enter the password himself
and come in?

302
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,480
Yes.

303
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:23,240
He must have broken his arm.
That's why he couldn't knock.

304
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,240
Who says that about their dad?

305
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,160
Didn't you tell him the password yourself?

306
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,640
Of course not.
My family knows my password.

307
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:31,960
It's the day my mom died.

308
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:33,760
The day your mom died?

309
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,800
That's the day your mom died?

310
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,640
Last spring,

311
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:49,320
she fell in the mountains,
but she ignored it.

312
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:50,840
Two days later,

313
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,520
she died from a brain hemorrhage.

314
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,680
I'm sorry.

315
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:57,840
It's okay.

316
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:59,600
I don't feel anything now.

317
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,480
I set it as my password as a reminder,
so that I won't forget it.

318
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,520
Why do I feel like

319
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,360
the relationship
between you and your parents

320
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,480
is a bit strange?

321
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,080
What's strange about it?

322
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,640
You're family.

323
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:20,400
And you respect their way of living.

324
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,520
But...

325
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:26,200
You don't seem to be so close.

326
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:28,520
We are close.

327
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,760
We can't be too dependent
on our parents, right?

328
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:34,560
You're right about that. But...

329
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,240
I don't know.

330
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:39,840
It just feels strange.

331
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,040
It's not strange.

332
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,400
In this world,
there are families like yours.

333
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,000
You live together
even after you've grown up.

334
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,560
And there are also families like mine.

335
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:54,000
The three of us live separately
and only meet occasionally.

336
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,160
Okay.

337
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,280
Here.

338
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:52,560
I'm fine.

339
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,200
I can manage.

340
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,800
What about you? Are you home?

341
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,600
You're going to my house?

342
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,880
You can bring the container back anytime.

343
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,640
Go home and rest.

344
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,880
Don't spoil my mom too much.

345
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:08,120
You have to reject her sometimes.

346
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,040
I'm not the one spoiling her.

347
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,920
She's spoiling me.

348
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,320
She said that after staying up all night,

349
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,200
I need to eat something good.

350
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,640
Okay. Tell me when you're back.
I'll pick you up.

351
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:26,680
That's it for now.

352
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,320
I'm coming!

353
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:47,240
-Morning, Mrs. He.
-Luming? Come on in.

354
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:51,080
Breakfast is ready. I was waiting for you.

355
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,640
Why did you bring gifts again?

356
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,480
It's just fruits.
You must always have fruits.

357
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:57,880
We have everything here.

358
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,120
Stop buying gifts.

359
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,320
Why is there a burnt smell?
Is something burning?

360
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,960
My husband wanted to make
steamed eggs this morning,

361
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,080
then he forgot about it.

362
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,840
-When I came back from exercising,
-What?

363
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,760
the house was full of smoke.

364
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,280
And the pot almost melted.

365
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,960
He's cleaning up now.

366
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,760
-My goodness.
-Mr. He.

367
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,760
My brain is failing me.

368
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,720
I should have just stayed there
and watched it.

369
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:22,680
You finally admit
that your brain is failing.

370
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,640
Weren't you in denial?

371
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,920
Why didn't you eat the walnuts
I bought you?

372
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,920
It's not that I don't want to!

373
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,360
I forgot to eat them.

374
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:37,360
We need to be careful about the kitchen.
We have to come up with something.

375
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:39,480
Gosh. What can we do?

376
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,920
If he's going to cook in the future,

377
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,040
he'll make sure he stays.

378
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,840
-Come, sit.
-Come.

379
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:45,960
-Eat up.
-Thank you.

380
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:46,960
-Here.
-Sit.

381
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,560
Braised Meat, stop barking!

382
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:57,840
This is...

383
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:00,680
Braised Meat belongs to Canyang's student.

384
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:03,160
This student works with Fanxing.

385
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:06,120
He's on a business trip for a few days,
so we're looking after him.

386
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,760
Braised Meat! Go!

387
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,840
Find your friends! Go on!

388
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:13,240
Come on, dig in.

389
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,520
Take the chopsticks.

390
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:15,880
-Let me.
-For you.

391
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,400
-Here.
-Okay.

392
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,120
Mom...

393
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:23,240
-Morning, Canyang.
-Morning.

394
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:27,240
Dad, Mom, I'll skip breakfast.
I'm going to school.

395
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:30,800
What for? Isn't it summer vacation
from Monday next week?

396
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:33,560
Something came up. Enjoy your meal.

397
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,280
-What?
-Canyang!

398
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,640
Didn't he ask for the steamed eggs?

399
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,840
If not, this wouldn't have happened!

400
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:41,520
Let him be.

401
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:42,960
Luming, let's eat.

402
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,400
You're not going home

403
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,120
if you're working
during the summer vacation?

404
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:48,520
Yes. A restaurant is hiring part-timers.

405
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:50,040
I'm already 20 this year.

406
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:52,480
My family has been paying for my tuition
and living expenses.

407
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,720
I have other miscellaneous expenses.

408
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,520
I can't ask them for money for that.

409
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:59,480
But your family is not poor
and you're the only child.

410
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:02,000
Who else would your dad
spend his money on?

411
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,480
That's true,

412
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:08,240
but a working-class family like ours
can't afford any risks.

413
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,880
And my parents are getting old.

414
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,480
They'll need money for their retirement.

415
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,560
Zhanni, you're so mature.

416
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,880
These things never crossed my mind.

417
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:23,280
Your situation is different.
Your family is rich.

418
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,280
Think about it.

419
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:27,120
Your parents' annual income is equivalent
to what my parents make in ten years.

420
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:32,800
Won't you feel bored working alone?

421
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:35,960
No, Big Head is working with me
to earn his tuition fee for next semester.

422
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:39,280
You two are so sweet.

423
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,400
You might as well date him.

424
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,400
Date him? Forget it.

425
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,640
We're good friends.
Who would I date a good friend?

426
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,640
Hey, that's dangerous thinking.

427
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,680
Don't you know
that you're flirting with him?

428
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:53,800
His head is so big!

429
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,160
Who would flirt with him?

430
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:57,640
That's his nickname

431
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:00,240
because his mom watched
<i>Big-Headed Kid and Small-Headed Father</i>.

432
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,840
It's not because he really has a big head.

433
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,440
It doesn't matter.

434
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,640
What about your summer plans?

435
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:07,320
Are you going home to see your parents?

436
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,320
Yes.

437
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:13,200
Then I won't see you the whole summer.

438
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,280
You have to think of me.

439
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,400
Let's keep in touch through WeChat.

440
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,200
You must think of me.

441
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,400
I will. Eight times a day.

442
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:26,560
That's not enough.
Think of me a hundred times a day.

443
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:27,520
No way.

444
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:30,960
If so, then you'll have
to think of me every second.

445
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:38,920
Why are there so many cars outside
during summer vacation?

446
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:51,800
Canyang!

447
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:55,720
He Canyang!

448
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:58,440
He Canyang!

449
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:08,160
MS. CAI

450
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:12,920
Hello.

451
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:15,680
<i>There are so many cars.
Where did you park?</i>

452
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,960
At the admin building parking lot.

453
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,560
-<i>I'm on my way.</i>
-Okay.

454
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,320
What took you so long?

455
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,120
You're early. It's not even 9:00 a.m.

456
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,000
You couldn't wait to see me, right?

457
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,200
Stop being narcissistic.

458
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:37,880
If your uncle didn't come to my house,
I wouldn't have come so early.

459
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,280
Why are you afraid of him?

460
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,640
He should be afraid of you.
You're his brother-in-law.

461
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,400
Don't remind me
of our complicated relationship. Get in.

462
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,120
You're really not going home
for the summer?

463
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:55,000
Of course not. Otherwise, how can we date?

464
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,520
What did you tell your mom?

465
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,520
I have to monitor my home renovation
since it's not done yet.

466
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,960
It's not like your apartment
is going anywhere.

467
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,560
I'm staying with my uncle anyway.
She won't suspect a thing.

468
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:08,800
Let's go.

469
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:10,640
PROFESSOR SONG

470
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,920
What's the matter, Professor Song?

471
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:19,960
Are you going to school today?
I have to go get something.

472
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,680
Give me a ride.

473
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,120
What happened to your car?

474
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:25,600
It broke down.

475
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,240
But I'm not going to school today.
I'm going out with some friends.

476
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:31,960
What friends?

477
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,120
Those two pool buddies of yours
from high school?

478
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,640
Yes! How did you guess?

479
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,200
Never mind, I'll take a cab then. Bye.

480
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:49,640
Let's go.

481
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,120
What on earth is going on?

482
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,160
Whatever.

483
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,520
Your fever is gone.

484
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:09,880
But go for a checkup at the hospital
after you return to the city.

485
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,280
See if conservative treatment
or surgery is required.

486
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:13,400
Take some rest.

487
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:15,600
-Thank you, doctor.
-You're welcome.

488
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:18,640
Doctor, can he work in this condition?

489
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:19,760
It depends.

490
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,720
But he needs a lot of rest.
He can't get too tired.

491
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,240
-Thanks.
-Welcome.

492
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,240
Thanks.

493
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,120
Ms. He.

494
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:28,840
I think I'm fine.

495
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:32,480
It's past nine now.
Let's return to the homestay.

496
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:35,000
-Can you handle it?
-Yes.

497
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,160
There are two homestay owners.

498
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,800
One of them contacted us.

499
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:41,440
The other one contacted a design company
from Shenzhen.

500
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:44,200
We didn't know about the tender.

501
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:47,440
The designer of the company from Shenzhen

502
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,880
will present their concept
and direction this morning.

503
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:51,160
We'll go this afternoon.

504
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:54,520
It won't be easy.
Yuan Song can't do this alone.

505
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:57,000
Let's hurry back and discuss it.

506
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,760
Okay. I'll get tickets
for tomorrow morning.

507
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,720
We'll go to the hospital right away
after we return.

508
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:03,040
Okay.

509
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:04,880
I got the medicine. Let's go.

510
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:07,040
-Let's go.
-Okay.

511
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,480
Hi, please wait.

512
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:19,200
The proposal for the tender
must be more detailed.

513
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,880
Ask the receptionist
how the projector works.

514
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,760
-Okay.
-This is your key.

515
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,880
-Call me if you need anything.
-Thanks.

516
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,000
You need rest.

517
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,000
Chang Huan.

518
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:33,040
If you don't feel well, tell me.

519
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,960
Don't force yourself.
Health is your priority.

520
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,160
Okay, Mom.

521
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:38,320
Don't worry, I'll take care of him.

522
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,840
Go to bed, ma'am.

523
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:41,600
Smartass.

524
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,000
Take good care of him.

525
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,080
Okay.

526
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,280
Go get changed.

527
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,760
You stink.

528
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:48,160
Let's go.

529
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:02,120
CONG XIAO

530
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,040
<i>You can do it!</i>

531
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,680
Mute your phone.

532
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,720
What a disgusting smile.
Was that a confession?

533
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,520
What are you talking about?

534
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,720
Aren't you working hard to get married?

535
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,280
Yes.

536
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:21,280
That's why we must get the deal today.

537
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:26,320
You seem like a different person lately.

538
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:28,600
Is that so? What changed?

539
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,160
To be frank, I underestimated you.

540
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:34,440
I thought you were like a snail
who hides in your shell,

541
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:37,160
moves slowly and has no ambitions.

542
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:41,480
But recently, you seem like an ox
who works tirelessly.

543
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,600
You take on so many tasks,
finish them quickly

544
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,120
and with good quality.

545
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,960
We're becoming a part of Aijia.

546
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:49,320
I'll be replaced if I don't work hard.

547
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:54,360
I am neither a snail nor an ox.

548
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:55,920
I'm a chameleon.

549
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:59,400
I change colors
according to the environment.

550
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,720
Mr. Chang, how are you?

551
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:06,240
Are you okay?

552
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,480
I'm fine. I'm sorry to make you worry.

553
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,480
Can we start now?

554
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,480
Yes.

555
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:12,920
Have a seat.

556
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,480
Here.

557
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,760
After conducting
the measurements yesterday,

558
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,400
we found a problem.

559
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,480
The house is built on a hillside,

560
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:32,520
about 30 minutes away from town by car.

561
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:35,200
First of all, we must resolve the issues

562
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,600
around electricity, sewage
and garbage disposal.

563
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:42,280
After our discussion, we suggest
placing methane gas tanks at the back.

564
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:45,280
Then, the issues regarding sewage...

565
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:51,280
You're awake. Did you sleep well?

566
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:52,640
Not bad.

567
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:55,320
-Is Chang Huan resting?
-Yes. Don't worry.

568
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:56,960
He went to sleep after eating.

569
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:58,480
Okay.

570
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,720
So how was the meeting?

571
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:02,600
I don't know.

572
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,720
They didn't particularly indicate
whether they liked it or not.

573
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,920
I think we failed. We tried our best.

574
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:09,679
It's okay.

575
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:12,199
Experiencing failures at a young age

576
00:34:12,679 --> 00:34:13,719
is good too.

577
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:16,639
A failure is a failure.

578
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,440
It will never turn into anything good.

579
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,960
Do you always give bad advice
to young and inexperienced subordinates?

580
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,480
Bad advice?

581
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:29,480
For young people like you
who have never experienced failure,

582
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,600
these consoling words
are the most practical.

583
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:35,120
Do you say that to those
who failed in love too?

584
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:36,400
Is breaking up good?

585
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,600
Leaving the wrong person
is also a good thing.

586
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:41,719
What about being dumped?

587
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:47,800
Here you go again.

588
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:53,320
All right. I'll accept my failure, okay?

589
00:34:55,960 --> 00:35:00,160
When will you quit this bad habit
of mocking me?

590
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:03,640
Only an elementary school kid
would make fun of someone he--

591
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,720
-Are you an elementary school kid?
-Yes.

592
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:15,800
It's fun and I think
you won't get mad for real.

593
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:18,400
Because you are a middle-aged woman

594
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:19,800
who has experienced failures.

595
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:21,520
Middle-aged?

596
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:24,760
I'm only 31 and a half years old.

597
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,320
A young adult at most!

598
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,040
-What? You don't agree? Am I wrong?
-That hurts!

599
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:38,320
-I won't do it again!
-Are you trying to mess with me?

600
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:45,840
You're so annoying.

601
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:50,920
Okay. I'll stop messing with you.

602
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:53,680
I haven't eaten yet.

603
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:54,680
Why don't

604
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:56,640
I buy you a meal?

605
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:59,560
How can I let you pay?

606
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:00,680
Then you pay.

607
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:26,440
Why are you walking so slowly?

608
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,240
I just feel like walking slowly.

609
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,160
Have you noticed?

610
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:47,560
When you mention your grandparents,

611
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,840
Meiyin or your sister,

612
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:53,800
you'll talk about the fun things
that has happened.

613
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,680
But when it comes to your parents,

614
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:00,800
aside from nice words

615
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:04,640
like admiration, respect,
and understanding,

616
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:09,720
you don't talk about any details
of your time together.

617
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:12,600
I was very young

618
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:14,720
when we lived together.

619
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:16,840
I have no memory of that.

620
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,520
Then, they got divorced.

621
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,560
And we lived apart from each other.

622
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,080
We would only get together shortly
during summer vacations.

623
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:30,680
So you're only used to keeping in touch

624
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:33,720
with your parents on special occasions,
like distant relatives.

625
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:38,280
Which is why you're clueless

626
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:41,000
about each other's values, hobbies,

627
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,920
friends, or daily lives.

628
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,160
If you continue keeping your distance,

629
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:48,800
you will really become strangers.

630
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:58,720
What is it?

631
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:02,600
Did I say too much?

632
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,680
No. I can't see the road.

633
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:08,800
You can't see the road?

634
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:10,960
Why?

635
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:13,640
Night blindness. I lack vitamin A.

636
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:16,720
What should we do?

637
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:19,720
I'll hold your hand then.

638
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,040
What will you do about it?

639
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:31,080
What's the cure?

640
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,240
I lack vitamin A.

641
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,000
I just need to take more vitamin A.

642
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:44,400
Can you hold my hand?

643
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,080
You're like holding a dog.

644
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:49,800
You're lucky someone is holding you.

645
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,440
Don't be picky.

646
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:54,080
You're so violent now.

647
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:56,760
I thought Professor He was exaggerating
when he said

648
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:58,160
that you'd beat him up.

649
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:00,760
I didn't know you were so chatty either.

650
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,440
There's no choice.

651
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,480
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.

652
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:09,680
Right. I was blind before.
I was blind, okay?

653
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:16,600
Stop it!

654
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:19,520
Walk properly.

655
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:23,360
Watch out.

656
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:38,000
<i>Door unlocked.</i>

657
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:39,000
Mom.

658
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:40,240
Why are you...

659
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:42,920
You're calling me Mom?
That's so polite of you.

660
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,600
Why are you here?

661
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:45,880
Am I not welcome here?

662
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,000
Looks like you don't have guests.

663
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:52,160
I'll sleep here tonight then.

664
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,000
Why are you sleeping here?

665
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:56,240
It's almost half past 11 now.

666
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,960
Fanxing is not home
and your parents are asleep.

667
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:00,640
I don't want to wake them up.

668
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:05,000
I think you can crash
on the couch for the night.

669
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:08,160
This is my house.
Why am I sleeping on the couch?

670
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:11,640
It's fine.

671
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:15,080
Let's have a heart-to-heart talk later.
Then, you won't be able to sleep.

672
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:22,680
If you want to talk like this,

673
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:24,280
I'm okay with it.

674
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:51,160
Don't you only eat cucumber salad
for supper?

675
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:54,080
You always say
that Fanxing and I lack self-control.

676
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:56,160
You two can do whatever you like,

677
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:58,400
but I can't indulge in food sometimes?

678
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:02,840
What made you come here so late?
Did you fight with Dongyang?

679
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,480
How can we fight? He's on a business trip.

680
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:09,400
He has been on business trips
since his promotion two years ago.

681
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:11,920
I'm telling you,
always being away on business trips

682
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,360
is a huge trial for couples.

683
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:14,360
I've been there.

684
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:17,520
When I was an exchange student in Sweden,

685
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:19,400
I met a Swedish girl--

686
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:20,960
That's enough. Stop.

687
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:24,040
You've told me about your Swedish girl
for 800 times.

688
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:29,880
Let's talk about your Chinese girl today.

689
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:32,320
What Chinese girl?

690
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,440
Did you go to school today?

691
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:35,520
No.

692
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:40,840
Yes, I did.

693
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:42,360
It's like this.

694
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:45,520
He Fanxing's boyfriend
had breakfast at my house.

695
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:48,560
He had to work through the night,
so he asked me to go to school...

696
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:53,120
It's true! He really came
for breakfast this morning.

697
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:56,560
He had to do overtime and asked me
to pick up his niece at school.

698
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:01,080
She had luggage, so I carried it for her.

699
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:03,600
That's because
my sister's boyfriend's niece

700
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:05,240
is also my niece.

701
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:07,480
We're relatives. I should help her.

702
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:09,480
-I helped her.
-You were just helping?

703
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:12,040
Of course. What else could it be?

704
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:13,640
He Canyang, don't give me that crap.

705
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:15,360
I know you better than your mom!

706
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:18,800
The two people you can't fool
in this world

707
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:20,880
are your sister and me.

708
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:23,360
