1
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,280
-Qingqing.
-Yes?

2
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,840
A new employee is coming in.

3
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,720
Please clear this table
from top to bottom.

4
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,480
Okay, I'll get it done.

5
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,720
Ms. He.

6
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:16,040
I have booked the table for tonight,
but they have limited seats.

7
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,680
There are six of us, right?

8
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,120
Please check the head count.

9
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:22,120
Me, Chang Huan, Bai, Cong Xiao,

10
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,400
Ms. He and Ms. He's boyfriend.

11
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,520
-Six!
-Okay.

12
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,760
-Then--
-Count me in.

13
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,880
Hey!

14
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:34,120
I was upset
when I didn't see you this morning.

15
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,120
Are you here to visit us?
Are those snacks?

16
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,600
You want to eat these office supplies?

17
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,200
You trickster.

18
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,680
I'm here to report for work.

19
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,320
Haven't you received the call?

20
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,840
Are you the new designer?

21
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,920
I thought you quit.

22
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,080
I'm back again.

23
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:00,080
You didn't want to leave me, did you?

24
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,800
Don't be ridiculous.

25
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,520
I couldn't leave Ms. He.

26
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,680
Haven't you had enough of her torture?

27
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,800
I guess I'm a masochist.

28
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,360
Where are we heading for dinner?

29
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,440
I think they're full.

30
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,240
Yes, the seats are limited.
We've already reserved for six, right?

31
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,760
That's not a problem.

32
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,280
It's just an extra chair.

33
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,920
I booked a private room.

34
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:29,240
But I think Yuan Song
already has other plans.

35
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,400
No.

36
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,800
Your boyfriend is buying us dinner.
I have to make time.

37
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,720
That's right!

38
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,960
I applied for a job at Aijia.

39
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,680
They asked me to come here.

40
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,640
Why did you apply to work at Aijia?

41
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:58,000
If you plan to go abroad,
you need to prepare for the exam.

42
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,520
I'll only leave early next year.

43
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,640
The rent is expensive.
I need money to survive.

44
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,640
So I signed a contract with Aijia.

45
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,520
They'll cover my expenses abroad
for two years.

46
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,160
I'll work at Aijia after I graduate.

47
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,280
Are you upset?

48
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,640
No.

49
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,440
Well...

50
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,280
You shouldn't attend tonight.

51
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:23,680
Why?

52
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,680
My boyfriend is buying dinner.

53
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,560
I know.

54
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,480
Didn't we have a deal?

55
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,520
We'll stay friends even after our breakup.

56
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:40,240
And we should be even closer
than just regular friends.

57
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,600
That's not right.

58
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,440
To me, you're family.

59
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,200
You know,

60
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,520
my parents don't really care much
about me.

61
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,080
You took care of me when I was sick.

62
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,560
You stocked up my fridge.

63
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,920
You ate what I cooked.

64
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,680
I gave you massages.

65
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,720
So, deep down inside,

66
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,680
you're already my family.

67
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,560
<i>What kind of logic is that?</i>

68
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:11,440
That's why I can't bear to be
out of touch with you.

69
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,560
I want you to be happy.

70
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,160
Regardless of who you are with,
I wish you well.

71
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,480
<i>So...</i>

72
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,360
<i>He has no feelings for me anymore?</i>

73
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,440
I thought

74
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,880
you only wanted to be friends with me

75
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,680
out of

76
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,920
plain courtesy.

77
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:39,120
Being friends with your ex
is the highest level of breakup.

78
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,400
<i>Yes.</i>

79
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,560
<i>I shouldn't have any feelings for him.</i>

80
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:49,960
He Fanxing.

81
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,680
You don't wish to be friends with me

82
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,280
because you still like me?

83
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,840
No.

84
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,800
I have moved on.

85
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,200
It's true.

86
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,160
-Really?
-Yes.

87
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,640
My boyfriend

88
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,520
is a good man.

89
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,520
We're about the same age.

90
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,800
He has a successful career
and he's a gentleman.

91
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,240
He cares for my family.

92
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,640
And he is funny.

93
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,360
He's generous too.

94
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,360
I'll get back to work.

95
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,280
<i>That was close.</i>

96
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:13,680
Isn't this place great?

97
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,640
-Look.
-You're here.

98
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,200
-Mr. Ye.
-Hi, welcome.

99
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,720
-Mr. Ye.
-Hi, old man.

100
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,560
Change of plans.

101
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,480
Just play along.

102
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,200
-Have a seat. Here, sit.
-Okay.

103
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,400
Let me sit here.
I need to suck up to the boss.

104
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,160
Chang Huan,
you want to sit beside Cong Xiao, right?

105
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,240
But Qingqing will beat you up.

106
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:58,040
Qingqing, let's swap seats.

107
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:01,680
No. Since Yuan Song is here,
I want to sit beside him.

108
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,320
He's cute. I'll enjoy dinner more.

109
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,800
Hey.

110
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,920
How can I let you have him
all by yourself?

111
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,720
Yuan Song, come and sit here.

112
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,520
I want to sit beside him too.

113
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,080
I'll enjoy dinner more too.

114
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,680
Okay. I'll just sit
between you two beauties.

115
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:28,880
Hi, sir.

116
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,760
Do the honors.

117
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,480
You're all my guests. Help yourselves.

118
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,280
Order whatever you want.

119
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,800
-Here.
-No.

120
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,400
-It's okay.
-No, it's not.

121
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,080
I'll do it.

122
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,920
How about some red wine first?

123
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:49,960
Sure.

124
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,680
Do you even know about red wine?

125
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,320
Just let Mr. Ye order.

126
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,280
I don't, but so what?

127
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,960
You can't go wrong with the expensive one.

128
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,480
I'll have this.

129
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,280
-Aerate it first.
-Yes, sir.

130
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:19,800
How much is it?
Let me tell you, I don't drink cheap wine.

131
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:21,760
Eight...

132
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:23,640
8,800 yuan?

133
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,600
The old man said we can order anything.

134
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,640
Sure!

135
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,320
You only live once.

136
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,440
It will be such a waste
if you don't do what you want.

137
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:40,960
Maybe I'll just buy some street food
the next time I treat you.

138
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,880
Give me the menu.
I'll order expensive food too.

139
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,000
-All right.
-That's right. Order away!

140
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:48,960
Let's see.

141
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,720
This is good!

142
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,320
This is good. I want to have this.

143
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,680
Didn't you quit already?
Why did you come back?

144
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,440
Because I want to.

145
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,440
You're good.

146
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,600
If I were good,

147
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,600
my girlfriend wouldn't get stolen.

148
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:29,480
If she could get stolen so easily,
that means it wasn't true love.

149
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,760
No one but the wearer knows
where the shoe pinches.

150
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,640
Even if you're not
her good friend anymore,

151
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,360
the friendship is real.

152
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,760
The world is ever-changing.

153
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,720
Just admit it when you've failed.

154
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:50,120
Only the last one standing
is the real winner.

155
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,080
You're right, old man.

156
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,520
We never know
who the last one standing will be.

157
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,120
I'll go ahead.

158
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,480
You little fox.

159
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:15,840
You were still a baby

160
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,440
when I became an expert.

161
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,240
You dare to compete with me?

162
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,200
You're back again?

163
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,120
It's a misunderstanding.

164
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,480
I'm sorry.

165
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:34,920
Check.

166
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,800
Slash, vertical.

167
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:40,040
-Check, horizontal, horizontal.
-Don't slack off!

168
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:42,040
You still have another stroke.
I'm looking at you.

169
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:43,640
Stroke.

170
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,720
Horizontal, dot.

171
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,680
Who is making a fuss?

172
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,640
-The fortune wheel is ever turning.
-You're playing games?

173
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,520
I will show you no mercy! Deal the cards!

174
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:56,960
Here.

175
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,360
Here.

176
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,680
I want to draw one too.

177
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,840
Here's the King.

178
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,080
Guess what number I got.

179
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,320
Revenge is sweet.

180
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,520
Don't get too cocky.

181
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:23,160
I want number six and number three
to cross arms and drink.

182
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,720
And they have to hold each other tightly
while drinking.

183
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,920
No cheating, I'm telling you.

184
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,560
Who is number six?

185
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,640
-Hurry up.
-What's yours?

186
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,160
It's you?

187
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,760
Who's my partner?

188
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:13,560
Ms. He.

189
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,240
Should we switch cards?

190
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,080
You can't do that.

191
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,000
That's not sportsmanlike at all.

192
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,880
Stop sucking up to Ms. He.

193
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,680
Her boyfriend didn't even say a word.

194
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,040
Yes. We need to take the game seriously.

195
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,720
Crossing arms and drinking is nothing.

196
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:32,720
Ms. He even set me up
with Mr. Ye last time.

197
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,400
Is that so?

198
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,920
Yes. The old man won't be mad, right?

199
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,040
You have a big heart.

200
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,800
Sure.

201
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,480
-Cross arms and drink.
-Cross arms and drink.

202
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,960
-Cross arms and drink.
-Cross arms and drink.

203
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,320
-Cross arms and drink.
-Cross arms and drink.

204
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,200
Fine. Cross arms and drink, right?

205
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,480
Do you know how to do that?

206
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:33,800
I have never done it before.

207
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,360
Yuan Song is giving
his first time to Ms. He!

208
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,480
Look. Yuan Song is shy.

209
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,920
He's blushing!

210
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,560
Lower.

211
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:51,520
Lower.

212
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,880
Wrap your arm around my neck.

213
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,160
Hang on. Hold tight!

214
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:12,480
-Hold each other tight.
-Hold each other tight.

215
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:13,520
Drink up.

216
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,080
All right. Next one.

217
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,200
Are you all right?

218
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:27,600
Here.

219
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,720
I want number one

220
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,360
and number five

221
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,120
to hold hands

222
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:45,760
and keep a two-palms-wide distance
between their faces.

223
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,280
They have to make eye contact.

224
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,400
And sing

225
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,960
"The Moon Represents My Heart."

226
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,360
Remember to sing it with emotions.

227
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,280
You're so demanding.

228
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,960
You're not number one, are you?

229
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,400
Sorry to disappoint you.

230
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,240
You scared me.

231
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:07,680
Who's number one?

232
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:11,440
Not me.

233
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:22,680
Sing us an emotional duet.

234
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,320
Get closer.

235
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,760
-Don't be shy.
-Two palms wide.

236
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,560
-All right.
-Closer.

237
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:32,640
-Hold hands!
-Hold hands and sing.

238
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,000
Hold hands, come on!

239
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,560
Sing.

240
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:48,640
<i>You asked me how deep my love is for you</i>

241
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:54,040
<i>How much do I love you?</i>

242
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,120
<i>My feelings are true</i>

243
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:01,360
<i>My love is also true</i>

244
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:07,200
<i>The moon represents my heart</i>

245
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:13,840
<i>A gentle kiss</i>

246
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:20,080
-<i>Moved my heart</i>
-His singing is not bad.

247
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:25,640
<i>Our feelings are so deep</i>

248
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:06,240
<i>The moon represents my heart</i>

249
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,160
What's going on?

250
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,240
Why does it seem like
there's a spark between them?

251
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,280
All right. Stop fooling around.

252
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,280
It's late now.

253
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,200
Let's have one last round.

254
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,440
Since it's the last round,
let's do it like this.

255
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:37,240
No matter who gets the King,

256
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:40,640
the punishment is to head to the entrance
and beg for one yuan.

257
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:41,760
What do you think?

258
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,240
-Good idea.
-Good idea.

259
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:44,280
All right. Deal the cards!

260
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,320
-Miss, don't go.
-Miss, please give me one yuan!

261
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,320
Give me some money.

262
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,560
Just one yuan is enough!

263
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:51,840
Sir!

264
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,320
You look rich.

265
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,800
I just need one yuan. Just one yuan!

266
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,760
Professor He.

267
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,680
Cai Minmin?

268
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,200
Which one do you want?

269
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,440
Professor He,
I want to suspend my studies.

270
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:51,320
Suspend your studies?

271
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,480
Why? Are you sick?

272
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:57,040
Didn't you say we can't be together
because I'm a student?

273
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,160
I'll suspend my studies for a year
and date you.

274
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,280
What are you thinking?

275
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:04,080
You want to suspend your studies
just to date?

276
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,720
Do you think you're cool?

277
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:09,360
Your parents worked hard for you to study,
but dating is all you think about.

278
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,440
Dating is not all I think about.

279
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:14,240
All I think about is you.

280
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,880
Anyhow, you can't quit school.

281
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,800
Studying should be your top priority.

282
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:25,000
You won't let me quit
and you won't date me.

283
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,480
What do you want me to do?

284
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,840
What do you mean by that?

285
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:32,080
You're an adult. A big girl.

286
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,440
Don't you know your priorities?

287
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:37,840
There's no man in this world worthy enough
for you to give up your future for.

288
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,760
You have to love yourself and be selfish.

289
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:43,120
Love yourself before loving others,
understand?

290
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:52,120
But what's the point
of understanding these things?

291
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,000
I'm still in love with you.

292
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,120
If you were in danger right now,

293
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,240
I'd be willing to die to save your life.

294
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,840
What are you talking about?

295
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,960
You're still young.
Stop talking about death.

296
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,760
I know you don't care about me.

297
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,560
Those reasons are just excuses.

298
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,800
You won't even consider me
even if I've graduated.

299
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,400
Because you don't like me at all!

300
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,960
Ever since I was little,

301
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,720
all the guys I've liked
have never liked me back.

302
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,560
I didn't say I didn't like you.

303
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,680
I know.

304
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,400
You just like me as a student.

305
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:45,600
You think I'm not sexy or feminine enough.

306
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,320
Who says I like sexy girls?

307
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:51,320
Taste is a subjective thing.
Cute girls are good too.

308
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:53,680
But I'm not cute at all.

309
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,360
You are. You're very cute.

310
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:58,120
Stop lying to me!

311
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,720
I bet you hate me very much.

312
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:04,080
You can't even be bothered to look at me.

313
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,560
I even comment on everything you do.

314
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:12,000
I'm just like an annoying housefly
buzzing around you.

315
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:13,600
I'm not lying.

316
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:17,360
-I really--
-I'm just a housefly!

317
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:18,760
Calm down.

318
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,640
Stop crying.
Let's talk this over, all right?

319
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,880
It's useless to talk things over.

320
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,720
No matter how hard I try, it's useless.

321
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,160
I've thought things through.

322
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,920
I won't bother you anymore.

323
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,080
You've thought things through?

324
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,400
That's good.

325
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,640
I want to be a nun.

326
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:45,040
All the guys I've liked
have never liked me back.

327
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,520
Buddha must be enlightening me.

328
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,280
He doesn't want me
to be concerned with dating

329
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,520
and wants me to become a nun.

330
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,000
-I'm leaving.
-Wait!

331
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:55,200
Why are you becoming a nun?

332
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:58,120
-Are you threatening me?
-It's Buddha!

333
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:01,040
Stop saying that.
Buddha is too busy to enlighten you.

334
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,400
If everyone becomes a nun
because of small problems,

335
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,640
temples would be everywhere
instead of shops.

336
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,560
Who says it's a small problem?

337
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:11,360
Love is so important
that my world is already collapsing.

338
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,320
Then you shouldn't be a nun after all.

339
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,160
Stop crying. Calm down.

340
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:16,720
Let's talk this over.

341
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:25,080
I'm not saying that we can't be together.
Let's talk this over.

342
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:27,600
Let's negotiate and reach an agreement.

343
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:30,280
-Is it still negotiable?
-Of course.

344
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,840
Okay. I'm all ears.

345
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:40,160
Our fundamental issue
is not because I don't like you,

346
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,880
but because I'm a teacher
and you're a student.

347
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:44,800
It will have a negative impact
and it's against moral values.

348
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,040
People will judge us.

349
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:52,360
But love has to undergo trials.

350
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,520
Stop reading bullshit on the Internet.

351
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:56,920
Don't be dumb.

352
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,960
A tree has to be planted in spring.

353
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:02,800
If you plant it in winter instead,
it will die.

354
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,360
And then you blame it on the tree.

355
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,080
Isn't that crazy?

356
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,360
What should we do then?

357
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:11,680
You can't just give up
without even trying.

358
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:15,240
Nobody said
we can't plant a tree in winter.

359
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:18,640
We can plant it in the greenhouse,
and move it out in spring.

360
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:21,440
How do we go about it?

361
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,040
I have the perfect idea.

362
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,840
We can be together.

363
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,360
But we can't make it public.

364
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:29,680
We can only do that
after you've graduated.

365
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,440
-I don't think I can make it until then.
-Exactly.

366
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,880
Your love towards Yuan Song
was just a flicker.

367
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,840
You won't cherish it once you have it.

368
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:41,280
I bet you will dump me within a week.

369
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,320
I won't! I will like you longer for sure.

370
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,840
You're much better than him.

371
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,000
You can't say that.

372
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,960
He will catch up to me in the future.

373
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,920
But Professor He,

374
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:02,400
our love for each other
isn't something shameful.

375
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Do we really have to keep it a secret?

376
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:07,920
Think about it.

377
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:10,400
If you agree, we can be together.

378
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,840
If you don't, then just become a nun.

379
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,200
Buddha is waiting for you.

380
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,360
My mouth is getting dry.

381
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:18,880
I'll get some ice cream.

382
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,440
What are you doing?

383
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,760
Tell me your standpoint.
Don't just hug me.

384
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:32,560
If I agree, does it mean
that you'll be my boyfriend?

385
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,120
Of course.

386
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:37,400
I agree!

387
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:38,880
Why are you bouncing?

388
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,720
I'm just overwhelmed.

389
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:43,960
This is my first time dating.
I finally have a boyfriend!

390
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:45,600
Hurry.

391
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:55,200
-That's it?
-What else do you want?

392
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,160
Maybe you should become a nun.

393
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:02,720
Forget it.

394
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:04,640
How petty.

395
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:09,040
I'm a bit hungry.

396
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:10,960
Do you have any food here?

397
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:13,320
My mom made some buns. Do you want some?

398
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,040
Yes.

399
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,400
How can you let your girlfriend
sleep on the sofa

400
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,840
while you sleep on the bed?

401
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,960
You're not a gentleman at all.

402
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:34,560
Hey, I'm already 32 years old
and I have cervical spondylosis.

403
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,800
Sleeping on the sofa would be torture.

404
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,760
Also, this will be your last sleepover.

405
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,040
Go to school on time.

406
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,880
Behave like a student. Do you hear me?

407
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,000
-Okay.
-Good girl.

408
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,840
Here.

409
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:50,400
Take out the trash.

410
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:52,040
Okay.

411
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:02,280
Ye, you forgot the key for the milk box.

412
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:03,760
Cai Minmin, there's another bag.

413
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:09,880
Isn't that my t-shirt?

414
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,960
She was all muddy yesterday,
so I gave it to her.

415
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,120
Okay.

416
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,760
So she slept at your place last night?

417
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:22,800
She missed her dorm curfew,
so I just took her in.

418
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:26,400
You know each other?

419
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,520
Where do you think you're going?

420
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,680
Aunt! Save me!

421
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:36,960
-Aunt?
-Aunt?

422
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,560
<i>I'm doomed.</i>

423
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,240
<i>I'm losing my appetite.</i>

424
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:53,280
<i>Why is Professor He's sister
my uncle's girlfriend?</i>

425
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:55,560
Keep it down.

426
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:01,920
My gosh.

427
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,920
What a coincidence.

428
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:07,520
So Minmin is Luming's niece.

429
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:09,480
As the saying goes,

430
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:11,760
"People who don't belong together
don't get to live together."

431
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:14,080
This is fate. Am I right?

432
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:16,840
Yes.

433
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20,160
Minmin, eat slowly.

434
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,080
I can get you another bowl
if it's not enough.

435
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:26,240
Mrs. He, your noodles are so good.

436
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,760
I'll come over more often.

437
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:28,840
Sure.

438
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:31,800
Mind your manners.
They're Grandpa and Grandma He.

439
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,880
No wonder I couldn't reach you lately.

440
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:38,120
You found another place to get free meals.

441
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:39,240
How rude.

442
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,280
Luming, it's okay.

443
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:44,160
Don't lecture the kid while she's eating.

444
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,360
It's bad for digestion.

445
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:46,920
She's not a kid anymore.

446
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,200
She's already 20,

447
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,800
but she still acts like a stray dog

448
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:52,760
and even crashed
at a male teacher's place.

449
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,080
If I had known that Aunt lived here...

450
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:58,880
I mean, Fanxing.

451
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,160
I would have slept at her place.

452
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,280
You think sleeping on the sofa
is comfortable?

453
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,400
Fanxing? Mind your manners again.

454
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,440
Are you okay?

455
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,240
-I'm fine.
-You and I are not done yet.

456
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,560
You didn't tell me
that Fanxing is your girlfriend now.

457
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:18,080
I have so many secrets
I want to share with Fanxing.

458
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:22,000
Like those bad ideas you had
when you were pursuing her.

459
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,600
What bad ideas?

460
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,240
Nothing.

461
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:30,320
Do you want me to teach you a lesson?

462
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:33,040
You're no longer protected
by juvenile law.

463
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,800
But there's a domestic violence law now.

464
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:37,000
Hitting your niece is considered
domestic violence too.

465
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:45,320
-Eat up. She's quite interesting.
-Eat up.

466
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,080
No wonder he looked familiar.

467
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:58,120
I saw him pick you up from school before.

468
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:00,520
How could I forget?

469
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,160
Does my uncle frequent your house often?

470
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:06,880
He's so sneaky.

471
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:09,720
Your uncle is dating my sister now.

472
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:10,920
And I'm...

473
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:20,320
Good thing we agreed
on our greenhouse plan last night.

474
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:23,240
Otherwise, a selfish person like my uncle

475
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:27,320
would break us up in every way possible
for his own happiness.

476
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,480
Let's just call it off.

477
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,120
No way!

478
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,800
I've met your niece before.

479
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:48,560
I know.

480
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:52,520
Your company designed the apartment
I bought for her.

481
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,160
No.

482
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:59,480
One time, I went to Yuan Song's place,

483
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:03,320
but he went to the construction site
because of an emergency.

484
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,560
-And then--
-I know.

485
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:08,160
She thought you were the maid.

486
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:11,040
You didn't take off your mask
even after you left.

487
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:13,680
Forget it.

488
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,680
I don't want to talk about your ex.

489
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:20,000
How do you know everything?

490
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:26,080
The longer I know you,
the scarier you are.

491
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,840
How did you manage to get
all these dark histories?

492
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:34,720
It was a coincidence.

493
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:38,560
I didn't know that Minmin
was your brother's student either.

494
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:44,360
Your niece had a crush on my ex.

495
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,880
Good thing he didn't like her.

496
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:49,440
Imagine this.

497
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:51,680
My niece's boyfriend

498
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,120
is my girlfriend's ex.

499
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,680
Could it get more complicated than that?

500
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:05,200
Don't feel so stressed.

501
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,640
This is just temporary.

502
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,400
We may not have a happy ending either.

503
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:13,040
It could have been worse.

504
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:15,640
What we discussed last night isn't
a strategy to keep this confidential,

505
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:16,960
but to keep us alive!

506
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,120
What if

507
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,600
your sister and my uncle got married

508
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,880
and unfortunately, we got married too?

509
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,640
How should we address them?

510
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,920
Is she my sister-in-law or aunt?

511
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:35,720
Is he your uncle or brother-in-law?

512
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,720
Worry about your own problem.

513
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:43,400
What if things got worse

514
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,440
and we have children of our own?

515
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:49,880
Say hello!

516
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,120
Hi, Aunt, Uncle.

517
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,400
Hi, cousin.

518
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:56,800
My nephew is such a good boy.

519
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:59,640
Hi, my cousin and uncle.

520
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,200
I'm going up. Bye.

521
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:25,440
Let me share a management tip with you.

522
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,440
What tip is that?

523
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:31,720
I realized a minor problem after the
dinner with your colleagues last night.

524
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,160
As an administration director,

525
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:36,360
you should keep a distance
with your staff.

526
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,480
Don't get too close.

527
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,280
Otherwise, they'll be hard to manage.

528
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:44,440
Can you please not beat around the bush?

529
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:47,080
I know what to do. No need to remind me.

530
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,080
You know what to do?

531
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,080
What will you do?

532
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,800
I'll just treat him
like an ordinary colleague.

533
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:58,720
No special treatments
or it'll look like I care more about him.

534
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,440
What a wise decision.

535
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:06,920
When it comes to love, I'm at least
a primary school graduate level.

536
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:09,920
I have to go.

537
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:11,800
Take care.

538
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:36,480
Let me do it.

539
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:47,760
Yuan Song is giving
his first time to Ms. He!

540
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,600
Hold each other tight.

541
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,720
-Hold each other tight.
-What about your arms?

542
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:54,560
<i>Look. Yuan Song is shy.</i>

543
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:55,640
<i>He's blushing!</i>

544
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:09,720
I'll do it.

545
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,080
What were you thinking about just now?

546
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,360
Why are you so early?

547
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,800
I'm meeting a client at 9:30 a.m.

548
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:28,160
Doesn't the company require us
to clock in first?

549
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:37,560
We have a special relationship.
I should follow the rules even more.

550
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:39,920
Otherwise,
it won't be easy for you either.

551
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,760
I separate personal and business matters.

552
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:52,200
Here's our purchasing
and engineering department.

553
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,560
Here's the marketing department.

554
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,440
The design department is here.

555
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:59,120
And this is our pantry.

556
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,760
We're a small company.
The duties are not clear cut.

557
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:05,720
So help Ms. Bai out whenever you're free.

558
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:07,480
Ms. Bai.

559
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:09,960
Hi, Ms. Bai.

560
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,080
Hi.

561
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,480
I'll bring you to see Ms. He.

562
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:13,560
All right.

563
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,880
-Bai.
-Yes?

564
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:25,680
Why is there another receptionist?

565
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:28,640
Qingqing has resigned,
so the company hired a new one.

566
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:29,680
Why?

567
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:31,480
You didn't know?

568
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,400
What's the hurry?

569
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,080
I haven't finished the handover yet.

570
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:48,960
-Did you resign?
-Yes.

571
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:51,200
-Did you get a new job?
-No.

572
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:54,280
I plan to get a diver's license
in Thailand next month.

573
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:55,680
I'll look for a job after that.

574
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:59,000
Since I'm living with my parents,
I've saved a lot of money.

575
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:03,200
I'm going to spend my two years' worth
of savings all on this trip.

576
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,120
What about Chang Huan?

577
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,720
If I leave,
nobody will pursue him anymore.

578
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,520
Shouldn't you be happy about it?

579
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:12,400
Qingqing.

580
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,960
I've never stood between you two.

581
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:17,160
And Chang Huan never said
he wanted to be more than friends.

582
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:20,960
So I should just blame myself
for failing to pursue him instead of you?

583
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:25,920
I originally wanted
to clear the air between us.

584
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:27,800
We're colleagues after all.

585
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:30,000
But you've been acting weird.

586
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:33,440
Chang Huan and I couldn't even
be our usual selves.

587
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,640
Fine. It's good that you resigned.

588
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,120
You don't have to see me anymore.

589
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,400
That's right.

590
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:39,480
That's right?

591
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:41,480
All right then.

592
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:44,720
You were the one who suggested
the King Game last night.

593
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,280
It was my fault.

594
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:48,840
I shouldn't have picked that card.
Are you happy now?

595
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:51,520
Whatever.

596
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,040
Lunatic.

597
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:59,440
You're angry. You're finally angry.

598
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:02,000
What's so funny?

599
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:04,240
-Are you really a lunatic?
-Maybe.

600
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:05,600
Wait!

601
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:09,360
Let's talk.

602
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:15,360
I've given up.

603
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:17,640
No.

604
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:20,920
To be precise, I was rejected.

605
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:22,720
When was that?

606
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:26,280
That night when we were
at the karaoke bar.

607
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:29,320
He told me that he tried.

608
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:31,960
And yet, he still couldn't fall for me.

609
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,000
He is such a kind person.

610
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:38,640
If someone else met a girl like me

611
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:41,160
who looks all right and takes initiative,

612
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:42,920
he would've played me.

613
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:44,560
Not only did Chang Huan not do so,

614
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,160
he even told me sincerely

615
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:48,280
that he'd try to fall in love with me.

616
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:51,960
I think he's really charming.

617
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:55,120
Yes. He is a good man.

618
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:57,400
So what?

619
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:58,840
You like good men.

620
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:01,440
But you don't want
to be more than friends.

621
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:05,480
You know that I don't have that intention,

622
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:08,440
but you still picked on me
and embarrassed me.

623
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:11,840
You're too complicated.
That's why I wanted to help.

624
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:14,920
It's how the evil supporting actress
helps the lead in dramas.

625
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:19,040
Cong Xiao, you obviously like him.

626
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:20,800
But you don't want to be with him.

627
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:24,000
Yet, you're upset
when another girl goes after him.

628
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:26,960
Are you conflicted
just because he is poor?

629
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:34,000
He is passive
and he accepts reality as it is.

630
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,320
He is humble and kind.

631
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:39,400
Everyone else thinks he is a good man.

632
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,320
But he doesn't grasp opportunities

633
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,360
or improve himself.

634
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,880
If we really were to start a relationship,

635
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:50,040
our lives would be full of disasters,
not happy surprises.

636
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,160
A future like that

637
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:54,640
would be bleak.

638
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:57,120
But you like him, don't you?

639
00:40:59,000 --> 00:40:59,840
I do.

640
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:03,520
They say that when two people
who love each other make eye contact,

641
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:05,520
their heartbeats are in sync.

642
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:09,880
Love alone is not enough
to support our lives.

643
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,880
It'll all be gone in a few years.

644
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:16,120
But money can.

645
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:03,320
