1
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,320
So has your family fallen apart now?

2
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,240
You didn't hear
what He Canyang said to me.

3
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:11,920
You'd want to sever ties with him
and publish that in a newspaper.

4
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,920
Is public announcement still a thing?

5
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,360
Reality TV mediation shows
are a thing now.

6
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:21,600
Fanxing's family matter is quite suitable
to be shown on TV.

7
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,720
It'll get high ratings.

8
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,320
If He Fanxing would do it,

9
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,120
I can call the director now.

10
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,160
Hurry.

11
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,680
Enough, you two.

12
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,120
Stop creating trouble.

13
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,560
I have enough of them.

14
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,200
But I think that

15
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,400
He Canyang getting angry

16
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,840
is just like Baylor barking.

17
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,360
That's just how he is.

18
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,240
When he's happy, he'll be nice.

19
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,160
Otherwise, he'll bare his teeth.

20
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,280
I know.

21
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:50,200
I'm just feeling upset.

22
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,600
After my dad fell sick,

23
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,800
I've felt really terrible.

24
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,560
It's like my life is a mess.

25
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,280
I can't get back on track.

26
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,320
I even made Ye angry today.

27
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,440
What happened?

28
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,000
I don't know.

29
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:11,600
Your boyfriend is angry,
but you don't know why.

30
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,680
He should be angry about that.

31
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,680
Is it because

32
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,200
we met Yuan Song this afternoon?

33
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,680
And that upset him?

34
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:21,920
Yuan Song?

35
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,040
He even thought I was angry.

36
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,800
What are you talking about?

37
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,800
Who was angry? You or him?

38
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,720
No.

39
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,680
We had lunch near the office.

40
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,600
We bumped into Yuan Song

41
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,560
and a female colleague
from the headquarters.

42
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,360
They looked good together.

43
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,400
Yuan Song was quite friendly towards Ye.

44
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,800
He didn't give him
the death stare anymore.

45
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,720
This should mean that he has let go.

46
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,840
I think it's good.

47
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,280
That's why I said,

48
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,440
"Whoever meets a girl like her

49
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,920
would definitely let go
of an old woman like me."

50
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,080
And Ye said I was angry.

51
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:08,960
But I wasn't.

52
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,680
I was telling the truth.

53
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:14,280
It does sound like an angry remark.

54
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:15,920
That's right.

55
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,080
You do sound a little mad.

56
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,560
How does it sound so?

57
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,280
That's not all. You are mad.

58
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,040
But you still don't realize it, do you?

59
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,120
Fanxing is slow.

60
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:30,400
But Ye is not.

61
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,720
Maybe...

62
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,880
I'm lacking sleep lately.
That's why I'm grumpy.

63
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:40,280
After I've resigned,
I have so much free time,

64
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,040
but I haven't slept well.

65
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:46,000
This is what happens
when you're in denial.

66
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,800
You tried to develop a deep connection
with Ye for marriage.

67
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,440
And you tried hard.

68
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:54,400
But you can't see progress,
so you're getting anxious.

69
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,720
Now, the reason has been found.

70
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,600
You're jealous of a colleague

71
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:01,480
who was having lunch
with your ex-boyfriend.

72
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,280
Jealous?

73
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,520
I was just a little unhappy about it.

74
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,040
That wasn't jealousy.

75
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,240
It was.

76
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,320
You're jealous because you still love him.

77
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,840
He Fanxing, you are trapping yourself.

78
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,880
You love him,
but you're trying to love someone else.

79
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,080
You're causing pain to the three of you.

80
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,600
-I--
-Don't explain.

81
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:35,240
You can't hide love.

82
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,920
You just fed him. Why is he crying?

83
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:46,200
He's either hungry
or having a stomachache.

84
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,320
Gosh.

85
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,800
The thought of a baby's poop
makes me want to puke.

86
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,920
You're not even there yet.

87
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,840
Don't cry, baby.

88
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:59,600
My darling.

89
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:03,160
Stop crying, my baby.

90
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:23,840
DAD

91
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,960
TEN THINGS YOU SHOULD NEVER DO
AFTER A BREAKUP

92
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,120
Gosh.

93
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:01,240
Dad, are you not busy lately?

94
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,520
Hi.

95
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:04,720
Thank you.

96
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,480
Enjoy.

97
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,640
I am.

98
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,240
Then stop sending me
those annoying articles.

99
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:16,200
But they have over 100,000 views.
I took forever to find them.

100
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:19,080
Well, stop it. It doesn't help.

101
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,640
I see. Okay.

102
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:28,280
But thanks for your concern anyway.

103
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:30,960
No big deal.

104
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:34,000
You can tell me anything.

105
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:39,560
But Ye Luming is so awful.

106
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,640
I've told him
I won't drink with him anymore.

107
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,880
-Aren't you close friends?
-Not anymore.

108
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,120
Anyway, we're done.

109
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,560
Dad, actually,

110
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,800
just live your own life.

111
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,000
I'm doing fine.

112
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,160
No way.

113
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,640
I can't swallow the anger.

114
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,000
It's okay if he wins in pool.

115
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,480
But he bullied my son!

116
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,680
I can't allow that.

117
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,600
Dad.

118
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,400
To me, it's already in the past.

119
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,160
-It's in the past?
-Yes.

120
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,680
Looks like Luo is quite attractive.

121
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,040
Luo?

122
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,760
That's right, Luo Wenyue.

123
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,640
Aren't you two always together?

124
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,800
We're just colleagues.

125
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,760
Is she not into you?

126
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
It can't be.

127
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,800
She should know that you're my son.

128
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,840
I'm trying to say that
I think Luo suits you better.

129
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,360
The way she works is like Meiyin.

130
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:45,120
She can help you run the company
in the future.

131
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,440
You don't have to be an architect.

132
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:51,360
Marrying an architect as your wife
is also an option.

133
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,840
<i>Stubborn.</i>

134
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,280
Xingxing.

135
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,720
You don't look good.

136
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,160
Are you not feeling well?

137
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,480
No.

138
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,240
Eat more.

139
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,120
This red one. The lung.

140
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,280
What lung?

141
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,480
Goat liver.

142
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,960
This is goat liver.

143
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:28,120
-Right, goat liver. Have some.
-Goodness.

144
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:30,960
Mom.

145
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:34,040
I'll take some food to Canyang, okay?

146
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,680
Who are you taking food to?

147
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,440
Mom, don't do that.

148
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,240
This is unfair to Canyang.

149
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,120
Minmin is already an adult.

150
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,280
Let them work it out themselves.

151
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,560
Work it out themselves?

152
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,360
How can Canyang be so senseless?

153
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:01,720
If Caiwei finds out,
she'll come knocking at my door.

154
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,920
I agree with your mom.

155
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,400
Canyang is more than ten years older

156
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,120
than Minmin.

157
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,240
There'll be a gap in maturity

158
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,800
and there is a greater responsibility.

159
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,560
Did Luming find out too?

160
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:20,840
See?

161
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,280
No wonder he no longer visits us.

162
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,000
No way.

163
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:29,320
I need to apologize to him properly.

164
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,120
Mom, why would you apologize?

165
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,160
-He didn't say anything.
-Yes, he didn't.

166
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,760
But would he feel any better?

167
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,240
Hello, Cong Xiao.

168
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,400
Okay, I'll wait for you at home.

169
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:51,800
All right.

170
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,800
My colleague wants to visit Dad.

171
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,520
No need. I'm fine.

172
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,600
-Tell them not to bring gifts.
-All right.

173
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,000
I'll clean up the house.

174
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,320
Eat more.

175
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,640
You're too skinny.
Don't try to lose weight.

176
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,680
I know. I'm full.

177
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:21,920
Coming!

178
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,560
Is that your colleague?

179
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:32,920
Hi.

180
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,240
-Luming!
-Mrs. He.

181
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,360
Come in.

182
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:40,000
Didn't you say you would come for dinner?

183
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,360
But why are you...

184
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
The supplements my sister bought
have arrived.

185
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,560
I was free, so I came.

186
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,280
Are Fanxing's colleagues coming?

187
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:51,280
Yes, to visit her dad.

188
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:54,120
You always bring us gifts.

189
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,040
Don't worry. They don't cost much.

190
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,640
-Luming!
-Yes?

191
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,680
Luming, come here.

192
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,880
Take a seat.

193
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,840
-I'll show you something.
-Yes?

194
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,480
Make some tea.

195
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:15,800
Look at my wristband.

196
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:20,400
High technology nowadays
is really helpful.

197
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,200
It has GPS.

198
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,600
It's waterproof.
I don't need to remove it.

199
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:28,520
Most importantly,
I don't have to worry that I'll get lost.

200
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,840
-You won't get lost again.
-Yes.

201
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,720
Mrs. He should get one too.

202
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,360
Well, after Fanxing bought me one,

203
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,000
Canyang bought one for me too.

204
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:41,080
I told him to give it to his mom.

205
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,640
What's the matter?

206
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,280
Luming.

207
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,600
-I'm really sorry.
-What?

208
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,840
We never expected this to happen.

209
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,440
But Canyang is not the kind of person

210
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:12,440
who plays with people's feelings.

211
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,200
He's just tactless

212
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,680
when it comes to love.

213
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:20,120
Don't worry. We're against it.

214
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,080
Canyang is much older than Minmin.

215
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,320
It's his fault. It's his bad.

216
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,800
Mrs. He, don't say that.

217
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,840
Both of you are nice people.

218
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,520
I trust his character.

219
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:35,280
But I'm with Fanxing now.

220
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,840
If my sister learns this,

221
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,880
she won't accept them.

222
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:43,240
It's not always the older one
in a relationship that's at fault.

223
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,600
Both sides are responsible
for their relationship.

224
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:48,720
So...

225
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:51,840
Just go with the flow.

226
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:55,840
I feel so sorry towards your family.

227
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,040
Don't say that.

228
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,560
Minmin has grown up. She has her opinions.

229
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,080
Before I could say much,

230
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:07,440
she got mad
and moved to her friend's place.

231
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,680
That's why,

232
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,240
when it comes to love,

233
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,320
no one is in control.

234
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,680
We're running out of fruits and snacks.

235
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,800
Let's go to the market.

236
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,560
Sure.

237
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,760
Mr. and Mrs. He, we'll go to the market.

238
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:34,760
Okay.

239
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,760
I'm sorry.

240
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:51,320
I was at fault yesterday.

241
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,760
What did you do?

242
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:00,640
I was upset and made an angry remark.

243
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,680
And you noticed that.

244
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,400
That's why you were mad.

245
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:09,880
I was.

246
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,920
But actually, I shouldn't be mad at you.

247
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,120
I asked for it.

248
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:19,000
No. It was my fault.

249
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:25,920
I'm serious.

250
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,400
I asked for it.

251
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:33,080
I knew you wanted your ex to let you go.

252
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,640
But I used it

253
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:38,400
as an excuse so that you would date me

254
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:41,520
and get into a new relationship
to get past the old one.

255
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,200
No.

256
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,120
I didn't feel used.

257
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,680
Even if that's the case,
I was the one who used you.

258
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:54,720
I thought

259
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:56,680
after we got together,

260
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,000
you would find that

261
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,520
I'm better than the rest.

262
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:01,960
And that I would be best

263
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,600
at making you happy.

264
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,960
That isn't the hard part.

265
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:10,800
The hard part

266
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,280
is making you fall for me.

267
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:17,280
I think we're pretty good together.

268
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,520
That's because you're nice to friends.

269
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,200
Didn't you notice?

270
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:27,000
You were happier
when we were only friends.

271
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,360
So?

272
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,400
What are you trying to say?

273
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,880
When it comes to work,
if I don't get any returns,

274
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,840
I'll stop investing.

275
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,880
The same goes for relationships.

276
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,160
Although I was the one who asked for it.

277
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,760
It was all my idea.
It's all because of me.

278
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,480
But after I've taken 99 steps towards you,

279
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,800
you should be the one to take

280
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,480
that one last step towards me.

281
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,280
One month.

282
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,000
If it doesn't work between us,

283
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,400
let's forget it.

284
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,000
How about fruits?

285
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,800
<i>Just one step.</i>

286
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,720
<i>Just that one step.</i>

287
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:07,120
The apples look good. Let's get apples.

288
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,160
Okay.

289
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,760
-It's not bad.
-Take more.

290
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:19,920
Hello, Mom.

291
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,480
Have they arrived?

292
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:23,840
I'll be right back.

293
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,720
-Have they arrived?
-Let's go.

294
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,880
Mr. He, you look better now.

295
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,320
Not as good as you guys.

296
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:33,880
Ms. He.

297
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,320
-You're all here.
-Yes.

298
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,120
Mr. Ye is here too? How sweet.

299
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,240
I happened to be free.

300
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,640
-Give it to them.
-All right.

301
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,120
Thanks for coming on a weekend.

302
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,400
Not at all. We should have
visited Mr. He long ago.

303
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,480
-Sit down.
-Sit.

304
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,360
We're going bowling later.

305
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,000
-You should come.
-Exactly.

306
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,800
We're so daring now

307
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,680
since you're no longer our superior!

308
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,560
I'm really curious.

309
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,120
Is Fanxing annoying

310
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:12,800
when she's in the office?

311
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:16,520
Like a plowing cow
who only goes in a straight line.

312
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,120
No, she's really nice.

313
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,960
Our male colleagues loved looking at her.

314
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:24,000
Really? They loved looking at her?

315
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:27,360
Then why have none
of her male colleagues courted her?

316
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:31,880
Mrs. He, the thing is,
she isn't interested in us.

317
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,360
What did you say?

318
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,600
Where's your respect?

319
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:39,280
Now that I'm no longer your superior,
you're edging me out?

320
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:41,720
I can bear witness.
She's really not interested in us.

321
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,000
Mr. and Mrs. He.

322
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,840
I have a meeting. I have to go.

323
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,320
You have a meeting?

324
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:51,720
I'll see you off.

325
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,600
No, stay and accompany them.

326
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:00,720
See you.

327
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,520
How sweet.

328
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:13,000
I'll cut some fruits.

329
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,800
-Have some water.
-Okay.

330
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,520
After you.

331
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,960
I will wipe you out!

332
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:44,960
How scary!

333
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,720
They were almost wiped out.

334
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,080
I'll wipe you out first.

335
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,600
-It's slippery.
-Don't move!

336
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:50,960
-Watch out!
-Stay still!

337
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,600
Where are you going?

338
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,480
-Let's add another person.
-Who?

339
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:58,040
Luo Wenyue is around.
Let's ask her to join us.

340
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,240
Okay.

341
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,640
Why don't the three of us go?

342
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:06,720
You can play alone.

343
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:11,040
Yuan Song asked her.
Why are you scolding me?

344
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,400
Why?

345
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:15,520
Your eyes were shining
when you heard that she was coming.

346
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:18,400
-There's no such thing.
-They're men.

347
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,320
They're visually inclined.

348
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:24,480
It's okay. The more, the merrier.

349
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,880
Even Ms. He said it.

350
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,120
My turn.

351
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:30,960
Hello.

352
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:32,880
Yes, the private room.

353
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,440
She's here.

354
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,360
Why? You don't like her?

355
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:43,400
I'm fine with her,
but Cong Xiao doesn't like her.

356
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:45,520
It's a war between beauties.

357
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,280
Hello, we meet again.

358
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:54,760
Hi.

359
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:58,680
Am I intruding to show up here
all of a sudden?

360
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,160
No. The more, the merrier.

361
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,520
Join in the fun.

362
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:04,600
Can you bowl?

363
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,760
To be frank, I'm not good at sports.

364
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,120
I lack coordination.

365
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,240
Yuan Song, teach me.

366
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,440
I don't really know how either.

367
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,400
It's okay, let's play together.

368
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,240
That's right.

369
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,120
Let's get into teams.

370
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,760
Losers will pay for the meal.

371
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,240
You and Yuan Song can be in a team.

372
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,400
Hey. I'll be with Ms. He.

373
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:25,880
Find someone else.

374
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:30,200
Well, the remaining two shall form a team.

375
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,560
Hey, what do you mean?

376
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:36,120
Hey, what's with them?

377
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,120
They're into each other.

378
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:41,000
Everyone knows that they have a thing.

379
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,480
It's somehow delightful.

380
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:46,400
But ever since Luo Wenyue's appearance,

381
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:47,960
the balance has been ruined.

382
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:51,440
Yuan Song, Chang Huan and Luo Wenyue
are working together

383
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,160
on the homestay project.

384
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:57,040
Although Luo Wenyue
seems closer to Yuan Song,

385
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:59,080
But Chang Huan always joins them

386
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,360
very naturally.

387
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:04,800
That's why Cong Xiao is very jealous.

388
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:12,040
Look at Luo Wenyue.

389
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:16,640
She looks innocent,
but she is wild at heart.

390
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:20,160
It's more than the art of seduction.

391
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,360
She's a femme fatale.

392
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,600
Yuan Song is single anyway.

393
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,680
How could you say that?

394
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:30,920
I feel like my man has been stolen!

395
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,480
Like this?

396
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:36,560
<i>Hey, when did he become yours?</i>

397
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,000
Hurry. Are you done warming up?

398
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,280
Who goes first?

399
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,520
Me.

400
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:45,800
Go for it.

401
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:52,120
It's fine if you quarrel with your parents

402
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:55,040
since your sister can be the mediator.

403
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,960
But you offended her too.

404
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,720
You're over 30 years old.

405
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:01,080
Can't you be more mature?

406
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:06,680
Have you made up with your uncle
since you're so mature?

407
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,120
Not yet.

408
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:12,120
I thought he'd be worried if I left home

409
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,640
and stopped posting updates.

410
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:18,440
He could come to my workplace
or ask Zhanni about me.

411
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,440
He has Zhanni's contact.

412
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,600
But he didn't come.

413
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:25,640
He didn't even call me, let alone see me!

414
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:29,880
Since he's so patient,

415
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,960
you can only go home and apologize.

416
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,080
No way.

417
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:36,320
I'm going against the world for my love.

418
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,400
Cut it out!

419
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,080
Are you delusional?

420
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,960
Who knows about you? Against the world?

421
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,920
Don't mock me.

422
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,800
I want to make up with my uncle.

423
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:49,720
But I left home with such grit.

424
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:52,960
If I returned by myself,
it would be embarrassing.

425
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:57,360
I have an idea.

426
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:07,480
Let's just go home
and pretend like nothing happened.

427
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,160
When a family fights,

428
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:11,640
we always regret the mean words we say.

429
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:14,360
We hope to be given a way out, right?

430
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:19,200
So the more impatient person
will be the one to do that.

431
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:22,240
The other person will think that
they've gained the upper hand

432
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,560
and let things slide.

433
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,640
-How do we do that?
-We'll just go home.

434
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,080
Pretend that we forgot,

435
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,160
as if we had never left home.

436
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,400
We only went to our friend's houses.

437
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:35,120
Go home for dinner as usual.

438
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:36,520
We're Chinese.

439
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,400
Everything can be solved over a meal.

440
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:44,240
What if my uncle gets sarcastic with me?

441
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,720
Then call him out as being petty

442
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:49,120
to bear grudges with his family.

443
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:53,160
Okay. Professor He, you're amazing.

444
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,080
That's nothing.

445
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:59,080
It all comes from life experiences.

446
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,520
I'll go home now.

447
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:05,040
I'll get everything ready
before he comes home.

448
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,800
I'll take the initiative
and gain the upper hand.

449
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,720
What a fast learner.

450
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,920
You're worth teaching.

451
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,280
Go now!

452
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,960
Not bad, Luo Wenyue.

453
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,680
The score is almost tied
between Yuan Song and us.

454
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:21,800
Looks like Ms. He and Bai
will have to pay.

455
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:24,240
Where's your competitive spirit?

456
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,120
So it's fine in life
as long as you're not the last?

457
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,880
Why are you involving life again?

458
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,960
Isn't this just a game?

459
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:34,560
Life may seem to be full of games,

460
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,560
but in fact, it's full of traps.

461
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,600
Amazing! You got a strike!

462
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,680
I'll teach you more.

463
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,760
This is the last round.
I can't lose to Luo Wenyue.

464
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,280
Then...

465
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:56,760
For the last round,

466
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:58,560
you do it.

467
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,520
Go for it.

468
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,600
Don't look at me.

469
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:06,480
We're different.

470
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,000
I'm okay with losing.

471
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,120
Besides, if we lose because of me,
you'll blame me.

472
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,280
If you win,

473
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,400
I'll be your girlfriend.

474
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:17,720
How about that?

475
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:20,280
Stop fooling around.

476
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,000
I'm betting on my future.

477
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,680
Is this bet

478
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,560
not attractive enough?

479
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,400
Deal.

480
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,320
Go!

481
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:10,600
I just noticed that Chang Huan
is very charming today.

482
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:11,880
Of course.

483
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:14,920
Driven men are always charming.

484
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,400
Thanks.

485
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,640
Where's Luo Wenyue?

486
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,240
-I don't know.
-She went to the washroom.

487
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:51,920
What is it?

488
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:53,560
I forgot my phone.

489
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,440
-I'll get it for you.
-No, I'll go.

490
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:59,240
Yuan Song, eat up.

491
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:01,360
Thanks for teaching me how to bowl today.

492
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:03,360
He's a really good player

493
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,960
and a good coach too.

494
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,640
Cong Xiao.

495
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,880
Your lipstick color is beautiful.

496
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,040
Thanks.

497
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:26,560
Chang Huan.

498
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,680
Let's go bowling again.

499
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:30,680
I think it's fun. I just learned it.

500
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:32,480
Let's play again.

501
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,200
Okay.

502
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:40,120
Let's go karaoke tonight.

503
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,440
Sure, it has been ages.

504
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:44,480
You go. I'm busy.

505
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,880
Are you going to meet your boyfriend?

506
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,280
I'm going to the washroom.

507
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,960
Ms. He is shy.

508
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,360
I'm getting some air.

509
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,640
Hey, Yuan Song.

510
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:08,960
Don't you think Ms. He
has been acting strange lately?

511
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:11,160
She looks worn out.

512
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,280
And she's quiet.

513
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:13,720
Her dad is sick.

514
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,640
Of course, she's sad.

515
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:20,320
-You're right.
-When did they break up?

516
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:25,840
Stop joking.

517
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:29,960
Yuan Song just likes to cling to Ms. He.

518
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:32,800
She's like his sister. What breakup?

519
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:34,920
Were they ever together?

520
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,800
What?

521
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,080
<i>No twists and turns.</i>

522
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:47,560
<i>I'm bored out of my wits.</i>

523
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:04,240
<i>Write a story of a wandering rose too.</i>

524
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,800
Uncle, have you eaten?

525
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:11,560
No.

526
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:12,800
Great.

527
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:15,080
I'm hungry.
I want to eat the food you make.

528
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,480
The fridge is empty.

529
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:21,040
Let's eat noodles with eggs and tomatoes.

530
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,360
Okay!

531
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:17,200
-Uncle.
-Yes?

532
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:19,800
Are you unhappy?

533
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
No.

534
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:29,720
I...

535
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:34,040
I really like Professor He.

536
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:42,920
I wish you and Fanxing the best.

537
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:44,760
But...

538
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:47,880
I won't give up on Professor He.

539
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,600
Whenever I think of breaking up with him,

540
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:53,320
my heart feels like

541
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:58,480
it's getting into a knot.

542
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,600
You love someone,

543
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:06,040
but you can't love freely.

544
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,040
You have to hide it from your family.

545
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,600
This feeling is too painful.

546
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,520
I felt guilty.

547
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:20,400
I even blamed myself
for falling in love with him.

548
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,680
There are so many people in this world.

549
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:29,240
Why can't I fall for someone
that everyone approves of?

550
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,120
If I could,

551
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:37,080
I would.

552
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:40,200
But...

553
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:44,600
I can't do it.

554
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:51,640
I'm sorry.

555
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:53,680
Uncle.

556
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,040
You've always been nice to me.

557
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:04,240
But I can't let go of a man for you.

558
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:11,800
There's no need to apologize.

559
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,560
Weren't you so full of grit before?

560
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,840
Why did you give in so fast?

561
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:24,880
You've spoken your mind

562
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:26,800
and gotten the upper hand.

563
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:29,400
You even gave me a lesson.

564
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:33,200
I'm apologizing.

565
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,120
I'm not lecturing you.

566
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,000
But you did.

567
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,360
You reminded me

568
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,880
that even if I'm the one
everyone approves of,

569
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,040
so what?

570
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:56,760
You're still boasting now?

571
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:17,000
Why didn't you go karaoke with them?

572
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:19,800
Braised Meat is home alone.

573
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:21,200
I have to walk it.

574
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,040
I see.

575
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:28,920
Are you feeling troubled lately?

576
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:30,800
You don't look great.

577
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,520
You were spacing out during the game.

578
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,640
You barely ate too.

579
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:37,440
But you drank a lot.

580
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:44,640
Maybe it's because of all the things
that have happened.

581
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:47,880
My dad is sick.

582
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,040
I've resigned.

583
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,560
And my best friends?

584
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:55,680
One got divorced after she had a baby.

585
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:58,640
Another broke up while she's pregnant.

586
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:02,080
It's like after living for so long,

587
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:05,680
everything is starting all over again.

588
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,680
Starting all over again at 32.

589
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:12,680
That must be hard.

590
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:16,400
It's hard for all ages.

591
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:23,640
I wonder what I'll be like

592
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:25,880
when I'm 32.

593
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,600
I'm not sure about other things,

594
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,920
but I think that at 32 years old,

595
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:39,040
you'll surely become a great architect

596
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:41,200
who has designed many nice houses.

597
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,440
What about you?

598
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:47,880
Me?

599
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,480
I...

600
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:59,640
I may have become
an even clumsier middle-aged woman.

601
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:13,440
What do you think about Luo Wenyue?

602
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:18,720
Not bad.

603
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,600
She's bright and beautiful.

604
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:27,360
Both of us like
the same Japanese architect.

605
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,160
We have a lot in common.

606
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:32,280
That's good.

607
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:42,600
You can forget about my one-sided love.

608
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:44,960
Luo Wenyue and I really get along.

609
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,480
Maybe soon, I'll fall for her.

610
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,960
Just live your life as you wish.

611
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:55,920
Thanks for sparing a thought for me.

612
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:00,000
But I didn't really mind,
so you didn't have to tell me.

613
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:02,760
I thought that you would feel guilty

614
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:04,360
about my one-sided love.

615
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:07,000
-So I wanted to let you know--
-No need.

616
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,240
I'm not that fragile.

617
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,240
Okay. You don't have to get mad.

618
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,200
Mad?

619
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,320
I'm not mad.

620
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,880
But I find men really funny.

621
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:23,000
After we broke up,
you couldn't even look me in the eye.

622
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:25,600
But when you meet
another interesting girl,

623
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:27,120
all of a sudden,

624
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:29,440
you can give me blessings.

625
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:32,760
I'm only trying to talk to you.

626
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:35,560
-Aren't we friends?
-Don't you have other friends?

627
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:37,920
I do.

628
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:41,520
Or is it stated in the law
that you need your ex's approval

629
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,640
to start a new relationship?

630
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:50,920
Forget it.

631
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:53,320
All the best to you.

632
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:55,000
All the best, okay?

633
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:57,480
Why are you mad?

634
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:59,040
I said I'm not.

635
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:00,440
Then you're jealous.

636
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:04,320
Ridiculous.

637
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:05,880
I can't be bothered with you.

638
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:22,120
