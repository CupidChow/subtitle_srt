1
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:04,200
Hello, Song Xue. Are you home?

2
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,800
<i>I'm still on set.</i>

3
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,360
I think the shooting will end at midnight.

4
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:14,240
I still have class tomorrow morning.
My goodness.

5
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:17,440
No expensive facial cream
will save my skin.

6
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,680
Take a look at the picture I sent.

7
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,560
You know branded stuff better.

8
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,800
Let me know where I can buy the dress.

9
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,600
Give me a moment.

10
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,800
This is a runway dress.

11
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,600
It has to be pre-ordered
at the official website.

12
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:35,840
Pre-ordered?

13
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,240
How much does it cost?

14
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,360
<i>Do I have to wait for a long time?</i>

15
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,120
It's around more than 10,000 yuan.

16
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:45,440
<i>And the wait would be around half a month.</i>

17
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,040
More than 10,000 yuan?

18
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,680
And half a month?

19
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,360
Why?

20
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,800
You want to buy that?

21
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,320
Did you win the lottery or something?

22
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,200
It's a long story.
Let's talk when we meet up.

23
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,320
By the way,

24
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:05,200
did you meet Li Haomiao last night?

25
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,800
<i>So, has he transformed</i>

26
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:10,800
<i>from a weird kid to a middle-aged man?</i>

27
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,720
<i>Hey, answer me. Don't play dead.</i>

28
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,240
Ms. Song, we're ready to film.

29
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,360
<i>I'll be right there.</i>

30
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,280
<i>The shoot is going to start.</i>

31
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,880
I'll let you off the hook this time.

32
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,480
Talk to you later. Bye.

33
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,360
Baylor.

34
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,000
Misfortunes never come singly.

35
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,080
First, there's Li Haomiao.

36
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,040
Second, that brat, Yuan Song.

37
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,120
And now there's this Ye Luming.

38
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,960
Am I under a curse or something?

39
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,040
Mr. Ye,

40
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,519
I might only be able to return the dress

41
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,080
in half a month.

42
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,520
I can't do that.

43
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,320
I just said I'd return it tomorrow.

44
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,600
Won't I be giving myself
a slap in the face?

45
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,880
Forget it.

46
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,960
The truth speaks for itself.

47
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,600
Baylor, what have you done?

48
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,640
SENT

49
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,080
Go reflect on your mistake right now!

50
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,640
What should I do?

51
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,240
<i>I'm sorry,</i>

52
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,800
<i>my dog sent it by accident.</i>

53
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,120
Albatross, here, lick this.

54
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,440
All you know is licking stuff.

55
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,040
Do you know how to accept money?

56
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,560
Here, accept it.

57
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,480
Can you do that?

58
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,760
Other dogs would accept the money.

59
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,480
I'M SORRY, MY DOG SENT IT BY ACCIDENT.

60
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,600
He Fanxing can't even eat
if she's hiding something,

61
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,800
let alone going home drunk.

62
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:06,880
Hey.

63
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,800
Don't you know who she was with?

64
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,880
She's your sister, not a teenager.

65
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,240
Why do you care?

66
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,800
I'm a bit worried

67
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,000
that the man might be Li Haomiao.

68
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,240
It'll be bad if she gets drunk
and begs him to be with her.

69
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,600
Men have this bad habit
of being with their exes

70
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,200
even if they don't have any feelings left.

71
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,240
I don't think it's like that.

72
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,080
That's not Ms. He at all.

73
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,080
You don't know her.

74
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,920
When she's drunk,
she becomes another woman.

75
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,560
She'll just ramble on
and let things slip from her mind.

76
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,960
If she were a spy,

77
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:42,520
torturing her would be pointless
but a bottle of liquor will do.

78
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,080
Isn't that cute?

79
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,120
Cute?

80
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,720
Are you serious?

81
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,800
Who was it that told me
when he entered her office,

82
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,720
even the air seemed to be
too thick to breathe?

83
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,440
She always keeps a straight face.

84
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,360
Had she been more gentle,
I wouldn't have talked behind her back.

85
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,160
Men.

86
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:10,120
Anyway, it's really weird
that she has never dated

87
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,400
in all these years.

88
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:15,080
She looks like someone who would
have had some sort of puppy love.

89
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,640
That would be

90
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,120
my fault.

91
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,720
SUN TONG LOVES HE FANXING

92
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,240
Sun Tong!

93
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,920
Sun Tong!

94
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,080
Sun Tong!

95
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:40,960
So you're Sun Tong?

96
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,000
Do you like He Fanxing?

97
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:43,960
What is it to you?

98
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,000
It's nothing.

99
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,720
It's none of my business.

100
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,560
Who did this?

101
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,920
Stop laughing.

102
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,680
He Canyang!

103
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,600
Focus on your studies.

104
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,680
I'll be watching you.
No puppy love for you.

105
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,880
What puppy love? Give it back.

106
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,320
He Canyang, give it back!

107
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,200
He Canyang!

108
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,880
Unbearable memories.

109
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,920
No wonder people say
siblings are debts from a past life.

110
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,720
I stopped messing with her.

111
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:16,080
But now, even playboys won't approach her.

112
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,280
Why don't you do it?

113
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,680
As an act of charity.

114
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,440
Seriously?

115
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,280
That was obviously a joke.

116
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,160
You want to be my brother-in-law?

117
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,920
I was wrong. Look, I was just joking.

118
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,240
You brat.

119
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,720
<i>I'll settle the balance in the morning.</i>

120
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,040
<i>I got you your favorite spicy hotpot.</i>

121
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,200
Goodness, I am no longer like that, okay?

122
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,520
I'm sorry!

123
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,000
-I'm sorry about your flower.
-It's okay.

124
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,880
-It's okay.
-I'm really sorry.

125
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:58,040
There are stars in your eyes.

126
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,480
They are glittering.

127
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,480
Can you

128
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:07,800
date me?

129
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:12,960
Me?

130
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:25,040
If it was ten years ago,

131
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:28,400
I would definitely date you.

132
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,560
What about now?

133
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,200
Now?

134
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:18,320
You're always late for work,
leave early, skip work without notice.

135
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,280
You troublemaker!

136
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,760
Will you be late again?

137
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:24,240
-Let me go first.
-You tell me first. Promise me!

138
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,640
I promise!

139
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,520
He Fanxing, please let go.

140
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:28,960
<i>No!</i>

141
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,200
Good morning, Ms. He.

142
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:54,720
Good morning.

143
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,760
You're early today, keep it up.

144
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:04,960
Don't treat me like a subordinate
when we're outside.

145
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:08,440
You're not my subordinate,
you're just an intern.

146
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,320
Let's be friends.

147
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,600
You've even kissed me already.

148
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:14,720
That doesn't count!

149
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:17,800
But that was your first kiss.

150
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,120
I said it doesn't count!

151
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,640
Stop that or I'll deduct your salary.

152
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:25,440
Why are you being so fierce?
Can't you be more friendly?

153
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,400
Keep your distance.

154
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,000
-Good morning.
-Good morning, Cong Xiao.

155
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,800
<i>Thank you.</i>

156
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:45,000
Qingqing, you left the gathering
too early last night.

157
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,680
You left right after nine.

158
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,720
I had to.

159
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:49,880
We have curfews.

160
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:52,120
My mom wants me to be home by ten o'clock.

161
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,000
Moreover, the best looking guy
among the six

162
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,120
only stuck around you.

163
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,000
Do you only care about looks?

164
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,480
He even owns three florist shops.

165
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,200
He smells like flowers.

166
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,880
You're not into him?
Give me his contact info.

167
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,120
Not a chance.

168
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,320
I haven't smelled any flowers yet.

169
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,720
At least, let me smell some.

170
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,640
I knew it.

171
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,680
No worries, I have my own target.

172
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:19,680
Had it not been
for the free seafood last night,

173
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,040
I would've never gone there.

174
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,680
Who is it? Is he in our company?

175
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,520
Good morning, Chang Huan.

176
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,320
<i>Thank you.</i>

177
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,160
What's wrong with him?

178
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,760
He didn't even greet us properly.

179
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,520
Stupid geek.

180
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:41,960
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

181
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:42,880
Good morning.

182
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,520
What made you show up early?

183
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,520
If I was late again,
I'd have been thrown back to school.

184
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,240
And I thought you were fearless.

185
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,000
Is Aunt Flo visiting?

186
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:02,320
If you miss her that much,
do you want me to call her?

187
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:03,920
You...

188
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,480
Hey.

189
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,640
You two look like quarrelsome lovers

190
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,000
that are always squabbling.

191
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,040
Just get together.

192
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:14,920
Am I a masochist?

193
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,760
How is it?

194
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,960
What a big company.

195
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,080
Not bad, He Fanxing.

196
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,000
You're already a director
in such a big company.

197
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,040
It's not that big.

198
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,600
We mainly design houses for newlyweds,

199
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,000
so there are only about 30 workers.

200
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:38,600
As the executive director,
I'm like the housekeeper.

201
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,520
No, you're doing well.

202
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,560
Unlike my wife

203
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,520
who only spends and spends.

204
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,760
She knows all the places
with the latest bags and clothes,

205
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:49,040
restaurants with new dishes,

206
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,520
or places with new wine cellars.

207
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:53,880
She's a food map and a fun navigator.

208
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,480
How do I describe her?

209
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:01,920
A silly cutie who knows nothing
but how to enjoy life.

210
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,640
But anyway,

211
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:10,040
when it comes to women spending money,

212
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,200
my take is that

213
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,520
I make it so she can spend it.

214
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,520
And sometimes she'll get me gifts
bought with my own money.

215
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,160
Like this one for example.

216
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,000
"I love you".

217
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,400
She made it herself.

218
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,400
-Let me show you.
-It's okay.

219
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,960
You've paid your balance, right?

220
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:32,600
Yes, but I got you
some spicy hotpot on my way here.

221
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:35,640
You used to like this,
so I bought it for you.

222
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:40,320
Never mind. I'll eat it later, thanks.

223
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,200
No, don't wait or it'll get cold.

224
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,240
Eat it while it's hot.

225
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,280
We'll be fined if we eat at work.

226
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,720
I must set a good example.

227
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,760
Well, why don't you pick a time?

228
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,680
I'll treat you and the lady to a meal.

229
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:55,560
Well...

230
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,440
Give me a minute.

231
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,000
I have a favor

232
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:10,839
to ask from you.

233
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,760
You met my wife last time, right?

234
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:17,720
She thought that you're excellent

235
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:19,960
in all aspects.

236
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:22,960
Her cousin.

237
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,200
He is a bank employee and 33 years old.

238
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,040
Married once but with no children.

239
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:29,240
Honest and sincere.

240
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,360
And a filial son too.

241
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,160
Fanxing, can you please,

242
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,800
for my sake, meet or maybe dine with him?

243
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:40,520
Otherwise, I don't know
what to tell my wife.

244
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,560
I'm sorry, Haomiao.

245
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,440
I already have a boyfriend.

246
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,120
I knocked but you didn't hear me.

247
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,080
Who is this man?

248
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,400
It's none of your business. Leave.

249
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,800
He tried to matchmake you
with an old fat man.

250
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,320
And you want me to leave?

251
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,080
Am I even your boyfriend?

252
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,280
You...

253
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,120
So, you're...

254
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,800
Stop it.

255
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,160
It's fine.

256
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,720
Since he's here today,

257
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,080
I'll just tell him.

258
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:40,560
I'm your boyfriend.

259
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,760
And I don't agree with you
being a bridesmaid again.

260
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,560
You've already done that thrice.

261
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,800
One more time
and your future marriage will be rough.

262
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,960
Like your wife, I'm superstitious as well.

263
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:53,880
Stop fooling around, get out.
Go out already.

264
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,480
Why must you be a bridesmaid again?

265
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,880
That role is usually done
by the bride's friends.

266
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,160
Doesn't she have any friends at all?

267
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,240
No, you're not doing this.

268
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,920
I know.

269
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,560
I won't. I'll settle this.

270
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:19,480
You two are together?

271
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:25,080
He looks so young,
so it never occurred to me.

272
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:30,280
Isn't your wife
a few years younger than you as well?

273
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,560
I understand.

274
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,520
People say that

275
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,560
your blind date is a reflection

276
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:40,120
of what the matchmaker thinks of you.

277
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,160
That's not it. Wait, Fanxing.

278
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,360
-My wife didn't mean that--
-It's okay.

279
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:46,000
I don't care how people see me.

280
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,280
But I'm afraid

281
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,520
you'll need another bridesmaid.

282
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:55,160
You can pamper your wife however you like.

283
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:58,440
But you can't ask others
to do the same, right?

284
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:00,680
She's your wife, not everybody's wife.

285
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,240
I should get back to work.

286
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,360
Let's forget the meal.

287
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,360
But I'll attend your wedding.

288
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,760
Johannes Vermeer,

289
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:33,080
one of the greatest Dutch artists.

290
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,480
An icon of the Dutch Golden Age,

291
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,040
<i>Girl with a Pearl Earring</i>,

292
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,480
a painting I personally enjoy very much.

293
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:44,400
A girl who holds back her words
while looking back.

294
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,320
Please don't ask questions.

295
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,760
Can anyone tell me
the other works of this artist?

296
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,440
Do tell, miss.

297
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,840
"Prepare for trouble,

298
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,680
and make it double.

299
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,440
To protect the world from devastation,

300
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,240
to unite all people within our nation,

301
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:17,520
to denounce the evils of truth and love."

302
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,080
Louder.

303
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:34,280
"To extend our reach to the stars above,
Cai Minmin!

304
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,720
Team Rocket blasts off at speed of light,

305
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,920
surrender now, or prepare to fight.

306
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,920
Meowth, that's right!"

307
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:46,720
Quiet.

308
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:50,320
Please take care of your friend
who has lost a bet.

309
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,720
Cai Minmin?

310
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,440
I'll remember you.

311
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,240
And I'll call your name next time.

312
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,960
Mr. He even said, "Louder, louder."

313
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,640
Let's go with <i>Sailor Moon</i> next time.

314
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,920
"In the name of the moon,
I will punish you!"

315
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,720
What goes around comes around.

316
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:15,000
Don't shoot yourself in the foot.

317
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,440
Mr. He seldom asks questions in class.

318
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:19,880
And you chose this class yourself.

319
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,280
Don't blame me.

320
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:22,920
How unlucky.

321
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,400
Old Man Ye, are you here to fetch me?

322
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,680
<i>Turn around.</i>

323
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,680
Catch you later.
Old Man Ye is here for me.

324
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,600
Old Man Ye!

325
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,680
Careful.

326
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,120
What a dream guy.

327
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,960
Why is Melon so lucky?

328
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,960
Are you jealous? Go ahead and take a stab.

329
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:59,880
If not for our friendship, I would have.

330
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:13,520
Old Man Ye!

331
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,600
I love pom pom chrysanthemums
and that French restaurant!

332
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:18,400
I love you so much.

333
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,840
Show some respect. Call me, "Uncle".

334
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,680
-Uncle.
-Good girl.

335
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,240
Happy birthday.

336
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,000
I have booked the venue
for your birthday party.

337
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,000
You're welcome.

338
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,480
One more thing.

339
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,120
What's this?

340
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,480
Didn't you say your dorm was too noisy?

341
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:45,080
I bought a 50 square meter apartment
in front of your college.

342
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,760
Uncle, I love you!

343
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:52,080
You're really too kind!

344
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:53,600
Hey.

345
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,680
I'm driving, stop it.

346
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:58,400
I'll take care of you
when you're old and sick.

347
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,720
You're all grown up.

348
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:04,280
Why do you celebrate your birthday
twice like a child?

349
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,320
Friends for the Gregorian calendar,

350
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,920
family for the traditional lunar calendar.

351
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,280
I take care of both sides.

352
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:13,320
And I'm going to confess my love

353
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,560
to my dream guy at this year's party.

354
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:20,400
I don't want to end up like you,
still single at 37.

355
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:24,360
My mom is so anxious
that she prays to any god she can.

356
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:26,800
She even gave you
a consecrated love charm.

357
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,160
You better try harder.

358
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,200
What's the use of being anxious about it?
I'm occupied with work.

359
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:34,160
That's just an albatross,
not a love charm.

360
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,320
And tell your mom

361
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:39,360
not to cry every time
we talk about this on the phone.

362
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,480
It's not a problem
to be scared of a woman's tears,

363
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:46,640
but if other women find out about this,
you're done for.

364
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:47,720
Enough.

365
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,120
Don't jinx me.

366
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,080
Hi.

367
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,640
I'm He Fanxing from Amazing Decoration.

368
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,080
I'm here to see Mr. Ye.

369
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:03,240
I recognize you from the other day.

370
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:04,520
But he's out for lunch.

371
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,680
May I ask what is this about?

372
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:08,920
It's sort of personal.

373
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,360
Personal?

374
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,200
Hello, Mr. Li.

375
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,720
I'm not in the office right now.

376
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,160
I'm on an errand outside.

377
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:45,880
I'll head back now.

378
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,240
Okay.

379
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:49,560
Goodbye.

380
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:00,760
I LEFT THE MONEY ON YOUR DESK.
PLEASE CHECK IT WHEN YOU'RE BACK.

381
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,360
PLEASE SEND A FRIEND REQUEST...

382
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,640
<i>Mr. Ye, I'm really sorry.</i>

383
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,640
<i>I'm paying you 10,000 yuan for the dress.</i>

384
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:33,720
<i>I had torn the dress. </i>

385
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:36,080
<i>I'll replace it with a new one
once I get it.</i>

386
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,800
<i>From He Fanxing.</i>

387
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,320
Paying for the dress,

388
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,920
then replacing the dress as well?

389
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,640
Come in.

390
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:53,920
Mr. Ye.

391
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,680
Details about the client's new car.

392
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,600
Let me ask you something.

393
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,800
Why would a person who was

394
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,840
after money, returned the money

395
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:06,480
after she got it?

396
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:10,360
Since she's after money,
she must be after a bigger payoff.

397
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:11,800
She's playing the long game.

398
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,000
Just as I thought.

399
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:18,520
Don't burn bridges.
They might come in handy one day.

400
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:19,840
She's good.

401
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:21,960
What happened?

402
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,200
It's nothing. Hand me the file.

403
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:29,560
There's one more thing.

404
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:31,880
A personal affair.

405
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,520
No personal affairs at work.

406
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:37,760
I know. You're my superior at work.

407
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:40,400
But after work, you're my distant cousin.

408
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,200
What did my sister say this time?

409
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,160
Can't you use words?

410
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:55,800
Last night, she called and cried,
begging me to find you a date.

411
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:00,680
This fast?

412
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:04,000
I got her love charm
only three months ago.

413
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,440
According to her,
it has already been three months,

414
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:09,920
but you're still single.

415
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
If heaven can't help, we do it ourselves.

416
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:15,280
So, is it a VIP member on a dating site,

417
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,120
or someone in her neighborhood this time?

418
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:20,320
She said to sign you up
for the current hottest dating show.

419
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,240
I refused.

420
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,000
Fine.

421
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,560
Just no dating shows.

422
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,280
We'll do a little get-together.

423
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:34,080
Arrange one like always. I'll go.

424
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:37,320
Okay then, time to work, I'm off.

425
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:52,680
RECENT CALLS

426
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:54,000
CREATE NEW CONTACT

427
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,280
ROTTEN

428
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:00,800
LOVE

429
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:02,520
ROTTEN LOVE

430
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:12,640
<i>So, Ms. Song,
what do you think of the participant?</i>

431
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:16,200
<i>It's absurd to assume something
that has never happened.</i>

432
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:19,440
<i>Our world changes, so do our choices.</i>

433
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:23,400
<i>Why do you think the partner
who emphasizes more on the relationship </i>

434
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:26,000
<i>is better than the materialistic one?</i>

435
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:29,320
<i>Ms. Song, our show
should deliver a positive message.</i>

436
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:32,120
<i>But are you encouraging gold diggers?</i>

437
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:35,080
<i>Yes, this is a positive show
that focuses on the topic.</i>

438
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:38,240
<i>So there shouldn't be
any hijacking of morality</i>

439
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,440
<i>and labeling of people on our show.</i>

440
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,920
I even saw a college student of mine

441
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,240
get in a wealthy old man's car today.

442
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:48,280
Kids nowadays are scary.

443
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:52,080
They should just look for
a simple and pure love in college.

444
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:55,120
Gold digger this, gold digger that.
How horrible.

445
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,680
Is it wrong for a proper lady

446
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:00,400
to wish for a good and secure life?

447
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:03,880
Even a sparrow builds a nest
before it lays its eggs.

448
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,360
The male sparrow in our house

449
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:10,640
has had the nest ready, yet no one stays.

450
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:13,760
Look at all we've spent
on other people's weddings,

451
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,200
we'll never get it back.

452
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,720
Don't put your hopes on me.

453
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:19,920
I'm a bachelor.

454
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,720
Put them on He Fanxing.

455
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:23,560
You?

456
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:26,440
I don't even care
if you want to be a monk.

457
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,240
You have no persistence.

458
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:30,760
If you ever get married,

459
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:33,520
you'll be invited to Song Xue's show
as an expert on the issue.

460
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,360
Don't waste other people's time.

461
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:39,480
Women

462
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:43,320
have to struggle harder than men
from the moment they are born.

463
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,200
I would rather have Fanxing stay single.

464
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,440
Seriously.

465
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:48,840
I can take care of my own daughter,

466
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:51,320
even if it's for her whole life!

467
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:54,320
You're already talking nonsense
at this age?

468
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,240
After the two of us

469
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,640
pass away,

470
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:02,480
there will be no one to care of her
even when she's sick.

471
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:06,200
I'll see how you jump out from your casket
to take care of her then.

472
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:07,760
If it's someone like Canyang,

473
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,840
I'll really jump out
and deal with him instead.

474
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,960
Just keep on talking about Fanxing.

475
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:14,920
Leave me out of this.
Why do you have to drag me into it?

476
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,160
I'm done.

477
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,520
I'm going to take Baylor for a walk.

478
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:19,800
He's at my place.

479
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:21,880
Okay.

480
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:26,800
Don't stay out too long.

481
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,840
You!

482
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,760
You and your big mouth.

483
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:43,800
It's not my fault
she feels bad for being single.

484
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:45,800
I didn't ask Li Haomiao to marry.

485
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:51,280
I told you before

486
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:54,240
that friend of her wasn't a good man.

487
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:57,600
A child's words can't be taken seriously.

488
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:01,320
Even Fanxing is still like a child.

489
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,280
It's so cute.

490
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,360
But why is it called Braised Meat?

491
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:20,880
It's my mom's pet.

492
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:23,160
She gave it that name.

493
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,160
The previous owner told her

494
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:27,120
if she ever gets bored of it,
she can braise it.

495
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:33,240
You seemed so reluctant before,

496
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:35,320
but you're actually quite aggressive.

497
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:39,360
Since I have made a promise,
I have to walk the talk.

498
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:43,400
And as your superior,
I have to set a good example.

499
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:46,800
Not again.

500
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,680
You're like a peanut.

501
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:52,080
Tough on the outside,

502
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,600
but crunchy on the inside
when you get through the shell.

503
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,960
What a weird analogy.

504
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,320
By the way,

505
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:07,120
thanks for today.

506
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:11,240
If you hadn't barged in,

507
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:13,040
I wouldn't have known what to do.

508
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:15,120
You're welcome.

509
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,920
And I didn't like him anyway.

510
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,320
So,

511
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:25,400
I hope you'll keep it a secret.

512
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:29,400
So this is why you called me out?

513
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,360
Setting a good example, you say?

514
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:34,960
What about you then?

515
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:38,080
Pretending we're a couple
walking their dogs?

516
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,320
How ridiculous.

517
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,560
What if I run

518
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,840
into a neighbor here?

519
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:45,960
How will I explain it?

520
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:49,440
Why do you care what they think?

521
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,240
They're not your husband.

522
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:54,480
That's right. They are not my husband.

523
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:57,240
But my parents
do public square dancing with them.

524
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,680
As their daughter,

525
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:02,680
I can't ignore
how people around me see me.

526
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:07,600
I may not really be into getting married,

527
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,480
but

528
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,719
even the wife of my friend from university

529
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:14,159
thinks that I'd be scraping for leftovers.

530
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,239
Let alone my neighbors seeing me

531
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,600
walking my dog with a young boy.

532
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,800
How will I explain that?

533
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,199
Just take it as a concern
from the neighbors then.

534
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:32,120
Concern itself is the shadow of stress.

535
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:37,719
Now you know
why I don't want your concern.

536
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,080
Don't mix this up with work.

537
00:34:43,239 --> 00:34:44,480
Also,

538
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,880
don't you dare share my private affairs
with others at the office.

539
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:47,960
Or I'll fire you.

540
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:53,840
Baylor, let's go.

541
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:55,880
Come on.

542
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,320
Let's go.

543
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:03,120
Hello. Are you Mr. Liu?

544
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,480
I'm Cong Xiao from Amazing Decoration.

545
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:07,080
I contacted you before this.

546
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:10,920
May I know when you plan
to renovate your house at Lijingwan?

547
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,840
Hello, are you Ms. Zhang?

548
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,880
I'm Cong Xiao from Amazing Decoration.

549
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,720
You've registered with us
during our exhibition.

550
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:31,560
May I know when you plan
to renovate your house at--

551
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,160
Thank you.

552
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,440
See?

553
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:41,080
We got these registrations
at the exhibition.

554
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:43,640
Call them one by one like this, get it?

555
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,880
Can we really get clients this way?

556
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:48,600
New girl,

557
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:53,360
do you think orders come to us
while we're sipping coffee in the office?

558
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,600
Should I hire you a nanny
since you're so precious?

559
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,520
Dear Ms. Cong,

560
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,760
"Helping new hires is our responsibility."

561
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,000
This is what Ms. He said.

562
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:21,240
Your intern, Yuan Song,
already has his own clients.

563
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:25,040
But this one, if she cries again,
I'll just send her back to her mom.

564
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,960
At least, she comes to work on time.

565
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:35,640
The company would go bankrupt
if everyone was as unambitious as you.

566
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:38,880
Well said.

567
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,040
He Fanxing speaking.

568
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,160
Mr. Li?

569
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,400
Reservation?

570
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:57,560
How many people?

571
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:01,440
Is the usual place okay?

572
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:03,960
Okay.

573
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,720
Let's get something to eat.

574
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:14,120
Hey.

575
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,160
Is Mr. Zhou courting you?

576
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,840
He's a really good catch.

577
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:21,120
His parents are relocated residents.

578
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,760
They live in the old district,

579
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:25,120
so they don't need much from their son.

580
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:27,080
And he's a motivated person.

581
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:28,960
He's going to take the CPA test.

582
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:36,560
Are you checking out
all the single men in our company?

583
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:40,120
I don't have to.
A chat at the pantry will do.

584
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,400
The pantry?

585
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,440
Then I'll have to install a CCTV camera
in the pantry.

586
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:48,360
Pay cuts for those chatting endlessly
during work.

587
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:50,920
I repent.

588
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:56,000
But I think you and Mr. Zhou
are such a match in all aspects.

589
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:00,840
But I want more than just a match.

590
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,320
I need to like him.

591
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:04,640
As for Mr. Zhou,

592
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:06,560
we've worked together for five years.

593
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:08,960
But the only time he made my heart race

594
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,840
faster than 120 beats per minute

595
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:14,560
in these five years,
was when he fell while setting up

596
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,320
a two-meter tall exhibition booth.

597
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:21,640
Ms. He, you're already 32.

598
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,360
Even a 22-year-old

599
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,960
takes her partner's wealth
into consideration.

600
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:30,680
Yet here you are, talking about
your heart beating like a young girl?

601
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,160
Isn't it obvious?

602
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:36,320
A 22-year-old girl
can't stand on her own feet,

603
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,480
but a 32-year-old can.

604
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:41,760
At least, I don't have to choose
between love or having bread.

605
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:45,120
I have nothing to say to that.

606
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,720
I have a hunch

607
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:52,120
that you and this man I'm introducing next
will really be together this time.

608
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:54,840
Did you find me a man again?

609
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:00,280
It's my senior's distant cousin.

610
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:01,960
It was originally my date,

611
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,800
but I met a nice florist guy

612
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:07,640
during my previous social gathering.

613
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:08,840
I'm seeing him now.

614
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:12,400
Otherwise, I would have
saved that fine man for myself.

615
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,880
He's 37 now.

616
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,480
The reason he stays single

617
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:20,440
is that he's waiting for the destined one.

618
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:23,720
Still waiting for the destined one
at the age of 37!

619
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:26,520
And here I thought
pure love is so rare these days.

620
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,600
The destined one?

621
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:35,080
He sounds interesting.

622
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:37,800
I knew it!

623
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:40,840
I knew the term, "the destined one"

624
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:43,120
would hit the spot for you.

625
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:48,600
She's matchmaking again.

626
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:50,440
Matchmaking?

627
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:53,680
Look at her excited gestures.
There's no doubt about it.

628
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:25,560
Coming!

629
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:46,000
I'm coming.

630
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:47,880
He Canyang!

631
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:50,000
How many times have I told you?

632
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:51,800
Why do you always forget your keys?

633
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:54,280
It's Saturday!

634
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,240
What now? Why are you here so early?

635
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:01,840
Professor He invited me for a meal,
and asked me to wait here.

636
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:03,800
Wait outside then.

637
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,680
How can you leave a guest out here?

638
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:08,400
Don't you have any manners?

639
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,400
You should ask yourself that.

640
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:13,880
You...

641
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:17,600
Suit yourself.

642
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:31,880
Oh gosh.

643
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:05,280
All right. Come out.

644
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:09,200
Here you go.

645
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:17,840
Braised Meat.

646
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:19,920
Braised Meat!

647
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:02,560
So that's what she looks like as a kid.

648
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:12,280
Hey!

649
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:15,480
Why did you enter my room?

650
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:17,560
So this is your room.

651
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:19,760
What did you expect?

652
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:21,760
Health supplements,

653
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:24,360
a walking stick, and dentures
just laying around?

654
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:29,440
Did you get up on
the wrong side of the bed?

655
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:30,480
No!

656
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:32,840
It's because you came into my room
without my permission.

657
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:36,320
So you want me to apologize?

658
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:38,000
Obviously.

659
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:40,000
I'm sorry.

660
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:42,800
Braised Meat ran in here,
so I came to get it.

661
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:45,120
I shouldn't have touched your things.
I'm sorry.

662
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:54,480
Then...

663
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:59,240
Never mind. But be more mindful next time.

664
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,240
Come here.

665
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:06,440
Say sorry.

666
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:07,960
Sorry.

667
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:19,160
I shouldn't have said that
and let him lead me by the nose.

668
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,680
I should have chewed him out.

669
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:25,600
Wrong move.

670
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:26,520
