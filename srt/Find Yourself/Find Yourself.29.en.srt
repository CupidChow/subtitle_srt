1
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,640
WELCOME TO MY BIRTHDAY PARTY

2
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,120
Come make a wish, Tangtang.

3
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,640
You're staring at him.

4
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,760
I'm just feeling a little awkward.

5
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,720
I used to think

6
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,320
that Wu Meiyin
was Yuan Song's ex-girlfriend.

7
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,440
She bought him branded goods

8
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,600
and even cooked for him.

9
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,920
Never have I thought

10
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,720
that she'd be his stepmom.

11
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,000
But why isn't Yuan Song
using his dad's last name?

12
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,040
At least we could have linked him

13
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,800
with Mr. Song from that.

14
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,760
Both of Steven's kids
follow their moms' last name.

15
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,280
His ex-wife's child has her last name.

16
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,200
Ms. Wu too asked for her girl
to follow suit.

17
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,360
So to be fair, Steven consented.

18
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,280
Is that so?

19
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,880
If Steven finds out
I snatched his son's girlfriend,

20
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,480
what would he think?

21
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:33,280
I'd have to leave Amazing Decoration.

22
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,800
It's okay. Resign and live off me.

23
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,560
-Why should I?
-This is poverty alleviation.

24
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:44,000
Even if I lose my job,
I still have my brother to depend on.

25
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,520
I thought you would depend on yourself.

26
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,200
Depending on my brother means the same.

27
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,480
What logic is that?

28
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:52,080
Why can you depend on your brother
but not your boyfriend?

29
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,880
Boyfriends can be
someone else's boyfriend.

30
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,240
But siblings are forever.

31
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,200
I think you're right.

32
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,240
We must talk about it on our way home.

33
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:03,920
-Really?
-Mr. Ye.

34
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,920
Hey. Let's go.

35
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,920
-Mr. Ye.
-You're a dad now.

36
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,600
-Mr. Ye.
-Have fun!

37
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,280
Hurry and go.

38
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,280
-Luming!
-Yes!

39
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,720
What's the matter?

40
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,440
Let's talk inside.

41
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,160
Try Meiyin's hawthorn wine.

42
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,680
Come on. Let's go.

43
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,560
I don't drink.

44
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:29,720
I don't drink.

45
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,680
When Steven and I just got married,

46
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,640
Yuan Song refused to call me Aunt,

47
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,600
saying that I'm young and pretty.

48
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,360
So he calls me Meiyin instead.

49
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,840
Time has changed.

50
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,720
He has grown up. He is out of reach now.

51
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,960
He never answers my calls
or tells me about his condition.

52
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,880
He studied the same field,

53
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,560
but he refused to join Aijia.

54
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,360
I don't know what he's up to.

55
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,880
Dad, must you lecture me
with my boss around?

56
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,320
I'm not lecturing you.

57
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,720
I'm just lamenting

58
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,520
the fact that you're much cuter
when you were a kid.

59
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:11,880
He.

60
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,000
How's his performance at work?

61
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:17,960
Well...

62
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:21,640
He was weak at time management
and was always tardy.

63
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:23,800
But not anymore.

64
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,800
He's adaptive
and has a nice sense of design.

65
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:30,160
Now, he can complete a project on his own.

66
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,720
Clients are mostly pleased.

67
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,840
Really? That's great.

68
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,080
He Fanxing always wants her staff
to obey the rules.

69
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,600
She never praised me.

70
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,400
Mind your manners.

71
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,320
How can you address her by her name?

72
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,240
How rude!

73
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,000
Not really.

74
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,040
We're close friends apart from colleagues.

75
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,920
We address each other by our names.

76
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:53,920
Right, He Fanxing?

77
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:56,960
That's right.

78
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,360
Yes, that's right.

79
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,040
Fanxing said her company
adapts family-style management.

80
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,040
There's no obvious hierarchy.

81
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:10,000
They often hang out for a meal or karaoke.

82
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,120
-Really?
-That's right.

83
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,600
We often walk our dogs together too.

84
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,200
Walk dogs together?

85
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,640
You have a dog?

86
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:25,080
My mom's Braised Meat. It's with me now.

87
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,480
I live near He Fanxing,

88
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,160
so we go to the same park.

89
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:36,120
But we haven't been there for a long time.

90
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,440
My brother is taking care of it.

91
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,720
So he'll walk the dog.

92
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:43,160
Right. Her brother was my lecturer
who's close to me.

93
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,720
He recommended the internship
at Amazing Decoration to me.

94
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,880
So you have such a relationship.

95
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,760
Yes. Yuan Song told me

96
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,920
that He Fanxing often looks after him.

97
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,400
Of course.
It's also because of her brother.

98
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,800
So, he eats at your house
and is close to your parents?

99
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,280
Yes.

100
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,000
Is that so?

101
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,280
I didn't know you were so close.

102
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,000
What a coincidence.

103
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,760
I didn't know that Yuan Song was your son.

104
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,680
Maybe you're not close enough

105
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,640
unlike He Fanxing and me.

106
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,080
It's not that.

107
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,480
Ye and I are very close.

108
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,520
We drink and play pool together.

109
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:31,120
By the way,
when He was seeing someone else,

110
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,240
Ye has liked her already.

111
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,520
He went out of his way
to court her, right?

112
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,400
What a strong wine.

113
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:46,920
Yuan Song.

114
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,400
Have you seen Ms. He's ex-boyfriend?

115
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,080
I heard he's young.

116
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,840
I have.

117
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:02,080
I bet he isn't as good as Ye, right?

118
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
-What's wrong?
-Your back is dirty.

119
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,120
-It's clean.
-It's okay now.

120
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,760
-No.
-No. This...

121
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,120
What are you saying?

122
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,520
How could he be better than me?

123
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,560
Don't get too confident.

124
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,280
I should go now.

125
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,560
My dad will wait for me if I'm late.

126
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:22,160
Right? What time is it?

127
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:24,640
Hello?

128
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,360
Yes, I did.

129
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,640
The driver I hired is here.

130
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:31,600
-You're leaving now?
-Greet the others. Don't mind us.

131
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,040
We'll take our leave.

132
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:35,280
-We won't see you off then.
-Okay, see you.

133
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,720
See them off, Yuan Song.

134
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,560
They said no need.

135
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,320
Let me give you a quiz.

136
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,760
A rare steak

137
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:03,040
and a medium-well steak met each other.

138
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,960
But they didn't greet one another.

139
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,400
Why?

140
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,960
Because they're not close enough.

141
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,640
Steven and his son

142
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,760
are like a rare steak

143
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,520
and a medium-well steak
meeting each other.

144
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,800
You and Mr. Song

145
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,080
are like a medium-cooked steak
and a medium-well steak

146
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,160
meeting each other.

147
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:32,480
You and your ex are the same, right?

148
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,720
That's right. We're not close.

149
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
You and I are also medium-cooked steaks.

150
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,120
Not close either.

151
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,160
But at least, we're the same.

152
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,760
I shouldn't have come.

153
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,280
Had I known...

154
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,120
I wouldn't have invited you too.

155
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,640
-Okay, drive safe. Bye.
-Thanks.

156
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,040
Dad, Meiyin.

157
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,840
-Yes?
-Tangtang is asleep. I'm leaving.

158
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:21,800
You're leaving?

159
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,360
Hey, it's late. Why are you leaving?

160
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,440
Why don't you stay?
I'll send you home tomorrow.

161
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,040
It's okay, Dad.

162
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,120
The last bus is at 11:30 p.m.

163
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,040
I can still make it. I'll leave now.

164
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,880
Okay, text me when you've reached home.

165
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,760
-Okay.
-Bye. Be safe.

166
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,680
Hey, he...

167
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,680
Does he hate me?

168
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,560
Rather than hate, he feels uneasy.

169
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:51,000
What do you mean? Why would he be uneasy?

170
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,320
He's not close to you.

171
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,760
Love needs to be nurtured.

172
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:57,160
He won't even stay. How can I nurture it?

173
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,360
Besides, I give him everything he wants.

174
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,880
Why won't he listen to me?

175
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,760
Yuan Song has never asked
anything from you.

176
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,480
Anyhow, I brought him up.

177
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,040
No, you didn't.

178
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,560
It was his grandparents.

179
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,320
Do you think you can give money
to a baby and let him buy

180
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,680
his own milk?

181
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,680
Or do you think that Tangtang

182
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:27,600
is planted in a bank
and showered with money?

183
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,240
Of course I know
I have to care for the kids.

184
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:33,000
But I had to make money.
We can't live without money!

185
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,680
Why can't he understand?

186
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:37,760
His grandpa kept the money you gave him.

187
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:40,400
He gave him the money and assets
on his deathbed.

188
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,480
So your son has never used your money.

189
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:45,880
To me...

190
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:49,600
it's good enough that he calls you Dad

191
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,200
and thinks that you're a good man.

192
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,320
Others reap and you sow,
yet you despise what you sowed.

193
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:56,800
You're sick.

194
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:00,800
Hey.

195
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,800
We were just chatting.

196
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,360
Why are you angry?

197
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,960
No matter what,
I'm still better than most dads, right?

198
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:16,240
Tell me. How are you better than them?

199
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,360
I...

200
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,960
At least, I found him a nice stepmom.

201
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,360
That's because I'm nice.

202
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,160
It has nothing to do with you.

203
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:32,560
What else?

204
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,800
I'll give him my company.

205
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:39,800
Tangtang can stay home and live off him.

206
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,400
Yuan Song won't accept your company.

207
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:46,040
Tangtang won't live off him either.

208
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,560
Steven.

209
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,160
Why are you so childish?

210
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,320
You want everyone to live
according to your will.

211
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,240
Your son...

212
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:00,920
doesn't hate you.

213
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,720
He wants to be close to you.

214
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,440
But he has to stay away from you
to not hate you.

215
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,080
If you don't change yourself,

216
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10,600
Tangtang...

217
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,960
might become like her brother.

218
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:14,680
Understand?

219
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,160
What?

220
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,520
Yuan Song's dad owns Aijia Decoration?

221
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:21,800
Yes.

222
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:24,800
That young and pretty Ms. Wu

223
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,000
from the investing department

224
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,200
is his stepmom.

225
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:31,240
She's only seven years older than me.

226
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,840
Who could have imagined that?

227
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,600
I've seen her.

228
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,120
She's young and pretty indeed.

229
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,320
Where did you meet her?

230
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,360
At his house with his sister.

231
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,040
You never told me.

232
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,200
I thought you knew.

233
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,440
Your dad is funny.

234
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,560
Yesterday,
he forgot to add water to barley.

235
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,280
Today, he forgot to add salt
to the noodles.

236
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:56,600
When he met Mr. Liu the other day,

237
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,800
he actually forgot his name.

238
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,440
Maybe someday, he'll lose himself.

239
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:02,920
That's an exaggeration.

240
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,440
Do you have a good memory?

241
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,960
Better than you.

242
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,120
Do you remember that episode
in <i>The Love Clinic</i>?

243
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:14,080
There was a guy
who went on a date with a bike.

244
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,600
He pretended to be poor
so that people wouldn't know he's rich.

245
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,640
Yuan Song is not like that.

246
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,800
He is not close to his dad
and he grew up with his grandparents.

247
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,000
Now that his dad is controlling him,
he is starting to rebel.

248
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,160
A left-behind child?

249
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,400
Something like that.

250
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:32,200
Yuan Song and his dad
don't seem to be close.

251
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,520
They were quite polite to each other.

252
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,920
I think Yuan Song is fine.

253
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,800
He just lacks love.

254
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:42,440
Why don't you invite him over for dinner?

255
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,440
Bring Minmin too.

256
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,960
They're schoolmates.
They know each other, right?

257
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,480
Yes.

258
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,600
That's great.

259
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,440
Young people will have mutual topics.

260
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,240
Yuan Song is not bad.

261
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:00,360
So is Minmin. Maybe they can...

262
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:05,120
Cai Minmin needs to study
or she'll fail again.

263
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:08,400
That's right. Yuan Song just
became a permanent staff.

264
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,840
He has a new project.
He doesn't have time for that.

265
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,200
What's with you two?

266
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,320
-I--
-Okay.

267
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:20,320
Keep your matchmaking passion.

268
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,360
Eat up.

269
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,440
Bai, come here.

270
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:44,800
Help me with the boxes.

271
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,920
The courier is coming at 11:00 a.m.

272
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,080
I thought you were Bai.

273
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,440
Sending festive gifts to clients?

274
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,480
Yes.

275
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,080
-Let me help.
-It's fine.

276
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:03,720
What is it?

277
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,080
Nothing major. I just want to apologize.

278
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,160
What for?

279
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:14,200
I didn't tell you that my dad
is the boss of Aijia.

280
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,720
I didn't mean to hide it.

281
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:19,280
He wanted me to join Aijia, but I refused.

282
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:22,000
So I hid from him
and only contacted Meiyin.

283
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:24,920
After that, Aijia acquired
Amazing Decoration.

284
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,440
All the more I had to keep it a secret.

285
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,840
I was worried
that everyone would judge me.

286
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,880
It's okay. I understand.

287
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,240
Your dad does not define who you are.

288
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:40,880
You can keep it a secret.

289
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,320
You're not mad?

290
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:53,400
If I had asked about your dad and his job,
would you have told me?

291
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:55,720
I would.

292
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,640
So, it wasn't being
kept secret deliberately.

293
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:01,920
You just didn't make yourself clear.

294
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,160
I didn't ask either.

295
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:08,600
Maybe, deep down inside,
I don't think it's important.

296
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,440
In that case,

297
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,200
you don't have to explain.

298
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,160
The client said he's stuck in traffic.

299
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:03,880
Okay.

300
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,640
Four shots of espresso?

301
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,720
Did you work all night?

302
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,640
I completed Donghai Mall's project
last night.

303
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,160
So fast?

304
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,120
Yuan Song and I will go
on a business trip tonight.

305
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,120
A business trip?

306
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:27,720
Who sent you?

307
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:31,640
A client saw our work
from our previous client online.

308
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,960
Yuan Song and I were in charge of it.

309
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,920
So Mr. Li sent us to do the measurement
and discuss with them.

310
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:43,640
It's a remodeling
of a 2,000-square-foot chalet.

311
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,080
A 2,000-square-foot chalet?

312
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,760
You'll work until next month.

313
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,280
Yes.

314
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,360
By the way,

315
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,400
you can continue giving me new projects.

316
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,560
Give me all you can.

317
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,520
Can you handle it all?

318
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,840
There are eight days of weekends
per month. I can use them.

319
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,080
What's wrong? Stomachache?

320
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,040
Had too much coffee?

321
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:09,840
It's fine.

322
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,400
Maybe it's just a stomach spasm.

323
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,240
I'll get another cup.

324
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,520
No!

325
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,560
You still want to drink coffee?

326
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,200
Use this.

327
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,640
Here.

328
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:09,720
Come in.

329
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,160
Ms. He, I have a favor to ask of you.

330
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,200
What is it?

331
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,920
I'll go on a business trip for three days.

332
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:26,000
Something came up with a friend
who agreed to take care of my dog.

333
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:29,080
Can you keep Braised Meat for a few days?

334
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,480
Let He Canyang take it.

335
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,600
I've asked him.

336
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,720
He's busy and will be back late tonight.

337
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,160
Please.

338
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:43,200
It will pee on the sofa
if it's mad and hungry.

339
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,880
-Okay, I'll go after work.
-Thank you so much.

340
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:50,800
Same password.

341
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,800
I owe you a meal. Bye!

342
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:12,080
You scared me!
I almost had a heart attack.

343
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,800
Serves you right for not locking your car.

344
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,640
Why aren't you at the West Gate?

345
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:19,280
I'm too tired to walk there.

346
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,440
Here, your milk tea.

347
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,360
So I can go anywhere I want today?

348
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,600
Yes, as long as we don't break the law.

349
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:30,880
Then we'll go save the animals
trapped in a cage.

350
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,320
One more time.

351
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,640
-It's fine.
-Go for it!

352
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:48,800
-This...
-It's rigged!

353
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,880
You wanted to save them.

354
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,560
-Next one.
-Let's continue.

355
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,640
Almost there!

356
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Not again!

357
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,280
Last two tokens.

358
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,200
Do you really want to save them?

359
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:51,280
Did you have to take it that far?

360
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:52,640
Of course.

361
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:54,960
Don't you like it?

362
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:05,040
We've saved the animals. What's next?

363
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,520
Something exciting.

364
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:11,360
Something that'll fire you up
that you can't stop yourself.

365
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,080
Braised Meat.

366
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,200
Why are you here?

367
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:32,720
Come. Up you go.

368
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,080
What's that smell?

369
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,800
Did you poop, Braised Meat?

370
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,320
My dear Braised Meat.

371
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,920
Why did you poop everywhere?

372
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,360
Good thing you didn't do it on the rug.

373
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:11,880
He?

374
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,040
Mr. Song?

375
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,240
Why are you here?

376
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,680
Yuan Song is on a trip.

377
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:23,240
I'm here to take Braised Meat
to my place for a while.

378
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:28,240
It pooped on the floor,
so I cleaned it up.

379
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,440
I'm leaving soon.

380
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:30,840
He.

381
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,160
Can we talk?

382
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,600
I'll be straightforward.

383
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:43,120
I don't know much about my son.

384
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,360
Seeing that he trusts you a lot,

385
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:49,000
I think you two must be close.

386
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:50,520
Can we talk?

387
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:54,320
Sure.

388
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,200
Have a seat.

389
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,800
-Is tea okay?
-Sure.

390
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,960
What kind of chair is this? This child.

391
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,520
-Have some tea.
-All right. Thanks.

392
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:36,280
Take a seat.

393
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,640
He.

394
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:43,520
Do you come here often?
You're very familiar with the kitchen.

395
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,760
I came here before.

396
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:53,680
Looks like you took care of him
outside of work too.

397
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:58,080
My son is not sensible.

398
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,800
Did he trouble you?

399
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,840
No, he didn't.

400
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,240
He's quite independent
and he has a good character too.

401
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:09,480
He gets along very well
with his colleagues too.

402
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,040
Everyone likes him.

403
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,200
Really?

404
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:17,600
He's not a mess? Does he wash his cup?
He doesn't piss people off when he speaks?

405
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,240
No.

406
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:21,960
This boy...

407
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:30,680
"Song Yuan"?

408
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,560
What a nice handwriting.

409
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:40,120
He, my wife told me that
he just broke up with his girlfriend,

410
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,520
so he has been feeling down.

411
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,400
Have you ever met her?

412
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:46,800
Yes.

413
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,080
Once in a while.

414
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:52,440
I heard that she's older than him.

415
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:53,840
What does she look like?

416
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:55,640
What does she do?

417
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,720
I'm not sure.

418
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,880
These are private matters.

419
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,680
You should ask him directly.

420
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:08,560
My son

421
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,560
doesn't talk to me.

422
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,600
Boys are different from girls.

423
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:16,760
They won't talk much with their parents.

424
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:21,280
My parents don't know
what my brother is up to either.

425
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:25,280
But they will always be our parents.

426
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:29,120
Parents don't get to choose.

427
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:31,880
He hates us.

428
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,480
I can't change that.

429
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:37,080
Don't misunderstand. He doesn't hate you.

430
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,120
He thinks that

431
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,960
you're working hard in your expertise.

432
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:45,120
You're amazing and he's proud of you.

433
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,880
Did he say that? Did he say that himself?

434
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,880
Yes, he mentioned it before.

435
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,880
But I don't know about the others.

436
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:00,440
This child seems closer to you.

437
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:02,880
Not at all.

438
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,480
He, how about this?

439
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:07,440
You're his senior.

440
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:08,880
In the future,

441
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,440
if he makes any mistakes in the company,

442
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:12,800
educate him for me.

443
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,640
Not to that extent.

444
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:17,880
Well...

445
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,040
Okay, then.

446
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:21,080
Please help him out.

447
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,240
It's so spicy.

448
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,680
How did you know about this place?

449
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:59,600
My aunt brought me here.

450
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,040
She loves the super spicy version.

451
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,000
How is it? Is it super spicy?

452
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:05,760
It is.

453
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:12,800
Why do you eat like a hamster?

454
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,640
Are you saying that I'm cute?

455
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:19,160
Cute? You're a troublemaker.

456
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,600
-But you like me.
-Don't get cocky.

457
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,600
Watch your behavior in public.

458
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:35,920
Again?

459
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:38,640
I can call you a cab
if you want to be a nun.

460
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:44,200
Aunt?

461
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:47,880
This is...

462
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,120
I don't quite know him.

463
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,160
We're sharing a table.

464
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,440
Don't tell my mom.

465
00:30:58,360 --> 00:30:59,400
Especially my maternal uncle.

466
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:04,200
Isn't your aunt your dad's cousin?

467
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:06,840
-Why would she know your maternal uncle?
-That's right.

468
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,560
She's his assistant.

469
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:09,600
Family business.

470
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:11,920
He's your boyfriend, right?

471
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:14,160
Hi, I'm Su Li, Minmin's aunt.

472
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,280
Sorry, Aunt.

473
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,280
We're secretly dating.

474
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:18,440
We can't reveal anything.

475
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,080
What do you mean?

476
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,280
It means

477
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,360
we'll keep our relationship a secret
until it's stable.

478
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:26,800
Why?

479
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,600
You can date older guys.

480
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:31,160
No. It's very complicated.

481
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,360
I can't explain it.

482
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,480
Anyway, time will prove everything.

483
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:38,400
Eat up.

484
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,600
We just began. We're starving.

485
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:44,120
All right. Continue your meal.

486
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:45,520
Don't tell my uncle!

487
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:51,920
You know them?

488
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,280
That's my niece. She got a boyfriend.

489
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:01,840
Where are they?

490
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,200
They left when you came here.

491
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:18,680
You must still be hungry.

492
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,200
Have some nuts.

493
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,320
Three Squirrels.

494
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:24,520
You know me.

495
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:31,760
My aunt is a spy.

496
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:34,560
My mom and uncle will know
that I have a boyfriend now.

497
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:35,680
And an old one too.

498
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,160
As long as I keep quiet

499
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:41,440
and my aunt doesn't see your photo
in my uncle's social media,

500
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:42,600
no one will know.

501
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:46,800
What if he takes a family photo with us
and posts it online?

502
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:50,360
If my uncle did that,

503
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:52,360
that means I'm destined to be a nun.

504
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:54,960
Not again. It's not that serious.

505
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,040
It is!

506
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,640
My uncle is very selfish.

507
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,600
He can become ruthless for his happiness.

508
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:03,360
Doesn't your uncle treat you well?
He even bought you a house.

509
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,600
That was before.

510
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:09,040
There's no kinship
in business and love life.

511
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,880
It's not a good situation.

512
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:12,840
Right.

513
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:14,640
I'll send you to the campus.

514
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:15,960
We must be careful.

515
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:19,600
Yes, now that I'm moving out,
we can't let our guard down.

516
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,960
You brought Yuan Song's dog home?

517
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:32,440
Where's Dad and Mom?

518
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:36,160
They're testing a new massage chair
at Mr. Zhang's house.

519
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:39,040
You two are quite something.

520
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,120
You're at the forefront of society.

521
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,600
You still care for his dog
after breaking up.

522
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,320
Is Ye Luming fine with that?

523
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,160
You're the one who is taking care of it.

524
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,680
I'm only in charge of bringing it home.

525
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:58,520
Aren't both of you
in an awkward position now?

526
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:02,360
A little.

527
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:04,600
But we can manage.

528
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,280
Will you two get back together?

529
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:12,720
Have you forgotten? I'm taken.

530
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:15,720
So you mean

531
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:19,240
that you and Ye Luming are dating
with the premise of marriage?

532
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:23,800
I said we're only giving it a try.

533
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:25,920
A try. I see.

534
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:29,840
Did you eat hotpot?

535
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:32,760
It's super spicy and super good.
Let's go next time.

536
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:43,080
You went there with Cai Minmin, right?

537
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:04,160
I went with my colleague,
but I met her there.

538
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:09,680
She must have gone there
with her classmate.

539
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,240
He's a handsome guy.

540
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:13,280
We greeted each other and left after that.

541
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,760
Why are you staring at me?

542
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:25,760
Don't tell her anything
about me and Yuan Song.

543
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:28,520
I won't. You were talking about this?

544
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:30,040
What else?

545
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,600
We have to be careful
when posting photos online.

546
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:40,800
Yes, we should.

547
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:45,560
A boyfriend?

548
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,320
Minmin never told me.

549
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:48,920
<i>Su Li said,</i>

550
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:51,480
if she didn't meet her yesterday,

551
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:53,840
Minmin wouldn't let us know about him.

552
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:55,600
What's wrong?

553
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:58,080
There's nothing to be shy about.

554
00:35:58,520 --> 00:35:59,360
<i>That's right.</i>

555
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:02,600
<i>Su Li said he's a working man
who is a lot older.</i>

556
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:04,880
I'm really worried.

557
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:06,960
Why don't you check on her for me?

558
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,320
All right. Leave it to me.

559
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:12,320
<i>Right, how are things with Fanxing?</i>

560
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:15,480
Not bad.

561
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,920
<i>Prepare a wedding house then.</i>

562
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,640
My house is fine.

563
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:23,120
<i>You're a bachelor. What do you know?</i>

564
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:25,160
<i>Your current house is okay for now.</i>

565
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:29,560
But when you get married and have kids,
you'll need a baby room and a playroom.

566
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:33,000
If you hire a nanny, she'll need a room.

567
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:34,040
<i>Why are you so anxious?</i>

568
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:36,360
We can plan that
when we're getting married.

569
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:37,560
<i>How can you not be anxious?</i>

570
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,720
<i>You'll have to wait</i>

571
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,880
for at least a year
to get the house and renovate it.

572
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:45,400
<i>If you two are not married by then,
everything will turn sour.</i>

573
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:48,240
Okay. You're right.

574
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,840
<i>Just buy a house first.</i>

575
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,040
I'll think about it.

576
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:56,600
I'm at my office. Let's talk later.

577
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:01,880
-Hi, Mr. Ye.
-Hi, Mr. Ye.

578
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:04,080
-Hi, Mr. Ye.
-Mr. Ye.

579
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:05,560
Come in, Su Li.

580
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:15,600
Boss.

581
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:17,760
Luming.

582
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:22,560
My sister said
you met Minmin's boyfriend last night.

583
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:23,800
What is he like?

584
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:27,320
He looked a lot older than Minmin.

585
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,040
I couldn't tell his age.

586
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:32,560
Perhaps 27, 28, 29 or 30 years old?

587
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:34,680
Miss.

588
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,120
You might as well say
that he's ten years older.

589
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:38,520
I couldn't tell.

590
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,880
He's quite good-looking.

591
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,640
Looks like he charms every girl he sees.

592
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:46,920
What's with Minmin?

593
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,240
Why won't she let us know?

594
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,160
I don't know. She wouldn't tell me.

595
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:55,280
Didn't she say she liked her senior?

596
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:57,000
What now?

597
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:58,840
Luming.

598
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:02,760
Do you know there's a group of loan sharks
that targets college students now?

599
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:06,000
They have a dedicated plan.

600
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:08,680
They send handsome guys
to date their victims

601
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,120
and ask them to lend money
from the loan sharks

602
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:14,640
on the pretext of needing the money
for their business or family.

603
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:18,400
The victims will sign a fraudulent IOU.

604
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:22,400
They'll give their boyfriends the money
and it'll be returned to the loan sharks.

605
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:25,360
The victims don't get any money
and will be in debt.

606
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:26,960
If they can't pay up

607
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:29,080
and the interests accumulate
until it hits a million yuan,

608
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:30,200
they would be done for.

609
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:37,920
Do you think that guy is such a person?

610
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,560
He's not a simple man.

611
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,720
Minmin is innocent
and inexperienced in love.

612
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:44,800
She's going to be hurt
if she dates a player.

613
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,640
Okay, I get it.

614
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,600
I'll talk to her later.

615
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:53,520
No.

616
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:54,880
I'll go now.

617
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:56,280
Luming!

618
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:58,560
It's Boss.

619
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:15,840
You're awake?

620
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:20,640
We're here.

621
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:23,160
What time did you sleep last night?

622
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,320
You slept soundly
after you got in the car.

623
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:28,120
The quarter assessment is here.

624
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:32,880
Everyone's looking at me with teary eyes

625
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:36,600
and waiting for me
to pay them their bonuses.

626
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:40,560
When will your company move?

627
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:42,080
Next month.

628
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:46,080
To an office building below Aijia.

629
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,080
The renovation is almost done.

630
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:49,520
So fast?

631
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:54,320
A decoration firm is decorating the firm.

632
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,280
Professionals work fast.

633
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:01,600
"A decoration firm
is decorating the firm."

634
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:03,680
Interesting.

635
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:07,160
Is the administration on its own?

636
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,760
Maybe. We don't know.

637
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:16,400
If you can't stay in Amazing Decoration,

638
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:17,840
come to Minglu.

639
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,800
Be my executive director.

640
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:24,080
Just like your boss and his wife.

641
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,920
We can be a formidable duo.

642
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,120
Spare me.

643
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:32,200
Your cousin is your assistant,

644
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:34,400
and your girlfriend
is your executive director.

645
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:37,360
Are you really making it
a family business?

646
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:40,600
A family business? So be it.

647
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:41,680
What about it?

648
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,200
We have good benefits.

649
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:47,640
Foot spa basin?

650
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,200
Health pot?

651
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:50,720
Walking shoes?

652
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:57,240
When is Minmin coming?

653
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:00,480
I have to be back before 2:30 p.m.
I have lots of things to do.

654
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:03,720
Soon, I guess.

655
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,080
Fanxing.

656
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:14,640
Minmin.

657
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
I'm sorry. Does it hurt?

658
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:19,960
It's all right. I'm fine now.

659
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:20,960
Thanks, Fanxing.

660
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,640
You're not a kid anymore.
Still playing pranks.

661
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:24,880
Serves you right.

662
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:27,440
I like it!

663
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:29,720
That was a nice punch.

664
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:32,360
I wouldn't eat with you
if Fanxing wasn't around.

665
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:34,120
You're being rude.

666
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:35,440
Call her Aunt.

667
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:37,720
That was before I met her.

668
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:41,600
Look. She's such a young and pretty girl.

669
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:43,440
Even I would hit on her.

670
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,000
How can I call her Aunt?

671
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:46,920
I should call her Fanxing.

672
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,480
I think that is just nice.

673
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:51,560
Aunt means your uncle's wife.

674
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:53,120
It's not right.

675
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:59,960
Then from now on, I'll call you Fanxing.

676
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,840
