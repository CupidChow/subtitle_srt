1
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,720
-Hi, welcome.
-Welcome.

2
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,320
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

3
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:12,480
For two? Please wait a minute.

4
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,400
Please write down your order on the paper.

5
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,880
A 45,000 yuan showerhead.

6
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,960
I must use it to its worth.

7
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:26,240
You can get a decent one with 5,000 yuan.

8
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,680
But this brand is good too.

9
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,160
It's exclusive.

10
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,400
My mom and uncle refused to buy it for me.

11
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,640
This is actually my living expenses
for the coming six months.

12
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,600
What will you do then?

13
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,680
What else can I do?

14
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,800
Beg, I guess.

15
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:49,240
That is why I'm asking you
to buy me lunch, Yuan Song.

16
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,200
Order as you please.

17
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:05,000
Yuan Song, you have to attend
our club's masquerade graduation party.

18
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,800
My list of dream men is done.

19
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:10,160
Hang on. I did say that I would go,
but don't put my name on the list.

20
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,640
Even if I don't,
the girls will still ask anyway.

21
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,280
So I just wrote your name.

22
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,760
You're going to graduate soon,
so it'll be their last chance.

23
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,640
Can't you just give them a chance
to get close to you?

24
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,520
Minmin.

25
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,840
I have a girlfriend.

26
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,160
I know.

27
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,280
Will dancing get you pregnant?

28
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,360
You have been rude to me lately.

29
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,120
Sorry, Yuan Song.

30
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,800
You were too nice to me
that it got to my head.

31
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:44,640
That's fine,
but you put me on the name list.

32
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:48,680
During the Midnight Promise segment,
I'll have to remove my mask.

33
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
The host will draw lots
and the girl with the said number

34
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,840
can choose anyone
on the list to dance with.

35
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:58,040
Do you want to bring your girlfriend?

36
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,080
But she probably won't go.

37
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,440
That would be great.

38
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,880
On that day, there won't only be
the Midnight Promise segment,

39
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,720
but there's also
the Love Confession segment.

40
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,760
If your girlfriend were to be present,
it would be interesting.

41
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,720
If you want to stay inside, then go on.

42
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,040
It's awkward.

43
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,720
I know.

44
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,440
Wipe up.

45
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,560
No, thank you.

46
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,720
By the way...

47
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,160
Why did you come and help me?

48
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,480
It's your classmate's birthday.

49
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:07,200
You insisted that I drive you here
and let others see me.

50
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,640
You even hugged and took advantage of me.

51
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,040
Just by thinking about it,
it's pretty obvious.

52
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,360
Why didn't you bring your boyfriend?

53
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:23,240
I don't want to become
my classmates' gossip material.

54
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,400
Also,

55
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,160
we're not at that stage yet.

56
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:30,960
I see.

57
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:37,160
It's obvious that your classmate, Amy,
likes to cause trouble.

58
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,760
She likes to feel superior.

59
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:42,040
She added me on WeChat, so I took a look.

60
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,240
A Paris purchasing agent.

61
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,080
-Did she add you?
-Yes.

62
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,360
Once you left,
she came to me with her phone.

63
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,480
Is she trying to sell you something?

64
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,680
Or maybe she is hitting on me.

65
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:54,960
That can't be it.

66
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:58,600
Her husband is in the senior management
of a Fortune 500 company.

67
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,000
Are you sure?

68
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,920
No way.

69
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,360
Hey.

70
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,320
What do you think?

71
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,600
Do you think it's true?

72
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,000
Tell me.

73
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,560
Look.

74
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,480
Fortune 500 is here.

75
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,400
Should we be more intimate?

76
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,000
No, let's just act natural.

77
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,840
Luming!

78
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,040
-Hey.
-Hey.

79
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,400
-What a coincidence. You're here too.
-Yes.

80
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,160
Is she your friend?

81
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,640
Let me introduce.

82
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,680
My girlfriend,

83
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,080
He Fanxing.

84
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,960
This is my good friend, Song Yifan.

85
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,440
-Hello.
-Hello.

86
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I heard a lot about you from Luming,
but I never had the chance to meet you.

87
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,400
-I'm actually here for business.
-All right.

88
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,000
Next time, let me buy you a meal.

89
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,160
Sure.

90
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,120
Go ahead.

91
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,920
Move it. Act normal!

92
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,280
That's enough. She's gone.

93
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,520
You act pretty well.

94
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,840
How can I say that in front of a pro?

95
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,320
Don't flatter me.

96
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,120
What are you looking at?

97
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,680
My boss is here.

98
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,280
So Steven is meeting your boss.

99
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,280
They've probably agreed
on the acquisition cost.

100
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,600
Acquisition?

101
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,560
Does your friend work for Aijia?

102
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,640
It's the other way around.

103
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,880
Aijia belongs to him.

104
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,080
Fanxing, you're back.

105
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,040
Yes.

106
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,560
What's wrong?

107
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,200
Did you not enjoy the class reunion?

108
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,680
I'm tired.

109
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,920
All of you are from different worlds.

110
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,040
Since it's a rare event,

111
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:48,120
everyone would want
to show off their good side.

112
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,320
To find balance and pride.

113
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,680
You know yourself the best.

114
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,760
There is no need to be unhappy.

115
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:57,840
Okay?

116
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,440
I know.

117
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,560
I just feel that...

118
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,440
as I age,

119
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:13,680
there are more things in this world
that I am afraid of.

120
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,080
Are you afraid of class reunions?

121
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:19,880
No.

122
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,640
I'm afraid that I'll embarrass you

123
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,120
and let you down.

124
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,080
Don't say that.

125
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:34,160
Ever since you were a kid,
when have you ever let us down?

126
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:37,920
We didn't even kick Canyang out.

127
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,520
What are you afraid of?

128
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,760
Silly child.

129
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,920
Don't they all say

130
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,920
that teachers will only be angrier

131
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:49,160
when elite students fail?

132
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:54,040
It would be great
if it was just failing a test.

133
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,640
Children are the parents' debts.

134
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,720
We can only accept it.

135
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,080
What else can we do?

136
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,440
You can't stuff him back in the womb
after giving birth to him.

137
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,280
Enough, stop whining in front of your dad.

138
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,440
Here, send these to the house opposite.

139
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,600
To our creditor.

140
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,880
How prideful.

141
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,000
Tell him to come over himself.

142
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,880
It's for Yuan Song.

143
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:21,920
Is Yuan Song here?

144
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:27,920
Professor He.

145
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,360
Rumor has it that you like Minmin.

146
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,560
Is it true?

147
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,760
Our age gap is huge.

148
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:37,160
If the rumor was about you and my sister,
would you believe it?

149
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,560
Of course.

150
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,520
As if.

151
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,400
She's just a brat.

152
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,960
She's more like my niece.

153
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:43,880
Hey!

154
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,760
-Help me, I'm getting attacked.
-Where are you?

155
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,920
Look at the small map.

156
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,320
GET TO LUOYANG MAIN GATE

157
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,400
-Thank you, Mom.
-Thank you, Mrs. He.

158
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:53,960
You're back.

159
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,800
Yuan Song!

160
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,040
-Why aren't you moving?
-I'm coming.

161
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,080
DEFEAT

162
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,520
You!

163
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,560
What's wrong?

164
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,160
You're an adult, but you act like
a student when you play games.

165
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,120
What a sore loser.

166
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:12,880
I was messing with him.

167
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,600
Let go, who are you hugging?

168
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,480
Are you on good terms with Fanxing now?

169
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,960
Unlike before when
you kept calling her Ms. He.

170
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,320
Your boss with a straight face.

171
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,720
She is pretty even with a straight face.

172
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,040
Goodness.

173
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:32,440
You just started working,
yet you're already a brownnoser.

174
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,720
Get some forks.

175
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,320
Okay.

176
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,080
Hey.

177
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,560
I thought you were going out with your ex.

178
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,200
I came back after our breakup lunch.

179
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,080
Wait.

180
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,560
Who did you ask to be your--

181
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,640
Don't speak nonsense
in front of Yuan Song.

182
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,720
All right.

183
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,920
Since when did you care
about your reputation?

184
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,680
Should I be shameless like you then?

185
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:09,400
Ms. He, please help me out.

186
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,680
I can't find the forks.

187
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,160
It's in that cabinet.

188
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:13,920
You can't even find that.

189
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,160
How dumb.

190
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,760
I remember it was here.

191
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:20,840
Isn't it right here?

192
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,240
Got it.

193
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:51,600
Yuan Song, you've lost a lot of weight.

194
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,960
Are the site visits very tiring?

195
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,160
Eat more, okay?

196
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,120
Eat up.

197
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,520
Goodness, don't pick that up,
just put it here.

198
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,680
Thank you, Mrs. He.

199
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,560
Don't worry, I'll help myself.

200
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,200
Good. It's good not to take yourself
as an outsider.

201
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,040
We love cooking for all of you.

202
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,000
By the way,

203
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:13,080
my niece, Lingling, is around your age.

204
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,880
Let me know when you're coming next time.

205
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,240
I'll invite her over too.

206
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,560
You youngsters can--

207
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,600
Mom!

208
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:22,840
Why are you shouting?

209
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,760
Can't I invite Lingling over?

210
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,040
Mrs. He.

211
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,480
-I have a girlfriend.
-What?

212
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,360
You said you were single last time.

213
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,360
Look at how handsome Yuan Song is.

214
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,280
Right?

215
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:45,800
A lot of young girls
must be chasing after him.

216
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,320
Don't worry about him.

217
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,320
Isn't your daughter troubling enough?

218
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:53,200
My niece is really good.

219
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:57,000
Didn't you tell me
to stop worrying about Fanxing?

220
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,360
What a pity.

221
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,240
Why does Luming

222
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,880
have a crush on another girl?

223
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,720
He and Fanxing make a great couple.

224
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,240
-Tell--
-Mom!

225
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,080
What?

226
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,240
I'm right here! You gave me a shock!

227
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,240
I told you we're just good friends!

228
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,680
So what?

229
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,000
Can't I just imagine?

230
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,000
Is it illegal?

231
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,680
Who is Luming?

232
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,400
-Luming is--
-Luming?

233
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,560
He is Fanxing's friend.

234
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,520
A friend introduced him.

235
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:36,400
Even though they don't like each other,

236
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,160
they are actually good friends.

237
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,400
That's right.

238
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,800
It doesn't matter if it's a guy or girl,

239
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,480
when they meet Fanxing,
they all would become brothers.

240
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:46,840
What an exceptional skill.

241
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:00,560
Use the ladle or you will spill it
all over the table!

242
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,080
Just let me do it.

243
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:05,760
Scoop it like this.

244
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,400
Even food can't shut you up.

245
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,960
If you feel troubled,

246
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,280
I won't visit your home
before we announce our relationship.

247
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,240
You have a boyfriend.

248
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:26,760
Why is she worried?

249
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,760
I'm not troubled.

250
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,000
It's fine even if you are.

251
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:39,960
We're going to announce
our relationship soon.

252
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,880
I'll leave the company by then.

253
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:44,560
You won't have to feel troubled
by an office romance.

254
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,480
Time passes so quickly.

255
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:50,800
Yes.

256
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:54,120
When you're happy, time goes by quickly.

257
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:57,240
When you're unhappy, the time feels slow.

258
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,120
If only it was the other way around.

259
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,280
That's right.

260
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:09,480
Life is to be enjoyed to the fullest.

261
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,800
Never let your wine cup go empty
under the moonlight.

262
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:15,920
Right.

263
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,080
Whenever we go on dates,

264
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,280
you always go along

265
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,320
with my preferences.

266
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:26,360
Don't you have anything
that you want to do together?

267
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,200
You're so generous.

268
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,840
Can you attend

269
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,400
the masquerade graduation party
that my club is hosting?

270
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,760
Masquerade party?

271
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,400
People become brave with a mask on.

272
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:45,440
They can invite their crush for a dance
or confess to them

273
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:47,480
and do something they usually won't do.

274
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:52,360
You might feel burdened by this,
so I'm just inviting you.

275
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,560
You can say no.

276
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:55,800
When is it?

277
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:56,960
Thursday night.

278
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,760
Will your lecturers be there?

279
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,760
I don't think so.

280
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,280
I want to dance with you.

281
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:13,480
If other juniors ask me for a dance,
it's hard to reject them.

282
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:21,320
If we're wearing masks,

283
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:24,680
then it shouldn't be a big problem.

284
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:30,800
Since nobody can tell who we are.

285
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,880
I don't have such outfits though.

286
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,520
Why don't we go shopping tomorrow?

287
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,480
Since when did you become so generous?

288
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:44,280
<i>I'm not generous.</i>

289
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:48,760
<i>It's just that we may bid farewell
anytime from now.</i>

290
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,480
<i>Before it ends,</i>

291
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,040
<i>I want to enjoy it.</i>

292
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,040
Good morning.

293
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,080
Good morning.

294
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,640
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

295
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,640
Good morning.

296
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,760
She's here!

297
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:17,440
She's here!

298
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,360
Wake up, everyone. She's here!

299
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,240
What are you talking about? Who's here?

300
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,720
Ms. Wu from Aijia's
investment department is here!

301
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,520
Who let you eat here?

302
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,840
How many times did I tell you
about the smell?

303
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:31,920
I'll stop.

304
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,160
Hello, Mr. Li.

305
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,880
Here, Ms. Wu. This way.

306
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,600
This is our marketing department.

307
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,840
This is our engineering department.

308
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,680
Here is our design department.

309
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:54,800
I would say that everyone
in the design team is an elite.

310
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,000
Please come this way.

311
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:21,680
Ms. Wu.

312
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,720
Look at our working environment.

313
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:26,040
The systems are all up to standard.

314
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:29,840
You can let us operate independently.

315
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,200
That's also an option.

316
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,480
Let's discuss this further later.

317
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,160
We had a similar case.

318
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,480
If the company is not centrally managed
by the headquarters,

319
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,800
there could be issues
with brand maintenance.

320
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,800
Yes, come in.

321
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,440
Mr. Li.

322
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,560
Great, let me introduce you.

323
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,800
This is He Fanxing
from our administrative department.

324
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,080
This is Ms. Wu
from Aijia's investment department.

325
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,960
-Hello, Ms. Wu.
-Hello, Ms. He.

326
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,840
We'll meet very often.

327
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,440
Here's your coffee.

328
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:05,840
Thank you.

329
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:13,880
What's wrong?

330
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,680
Your perfume is very unique.

331
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:25,120
When women meet,

332
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:28,760
we always ask for the lipstick colors
or perfumes we use.

333
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:32,240
But this perfume is not for sale.

334
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,800
A perfumer friend made it for me.

335
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,240
I can introduce you to each other.

336
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:40,080
Thank you, Ms. Wu.

337
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,360
-We'll be going now.
-Okay.

338
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,600
Ms. Wu, please go on.

339
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,640
Let's continue, so...

340
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:53,520
<i>So</i>

341
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:56,440
<i>Meiyin has been to Yuan Song's house.</i>

342
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,400
What are you doing?

343
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,560
I smell perfume.

344
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:16,320
Isn't it the smell of coffee?

345
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,120
Is that so?

346
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:43,400
Why are you here?

347
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,120
It's quiet here.

348
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,480
Well,

349
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,400
not everyone can come in here.

350
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,160
Bai must have forgotten to lock the door.

351
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:03,560
I won't come in again,
but let me work here for now.

352
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:05,880
Okay.

353
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,800
Right, the people from Aijia are here.

354
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,800
Did you know?

355
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,480
Yes.

356
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:29,400
<i>Where is the line
between hiding and deceiving?</i>

357
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:34,320
<i>How much gray area is there
between not being honest and lying?</i>

358
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,760
<i>Perhaps, it's like how ice melts in water.</i>

359
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:44,880
<i>Eventually,</i>

360
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,440
<i>there will be no difference.</i>

361
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:57,760
Professor He!

362
00:22:58,920 --> 00:22:59,840
What's up?

363
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,880
I would like to invite you
to a charity event.

364
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,360
What charity event?

365
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,600
A lunch of kindness!

366
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,520
My parents were entrepreneurs
when I was young.

367
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:23,280
They had no time for me.

368
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:27,000
Not only did my uncle buy me meals,
but he also sent me to school.

369
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,480
To save time and money,

370
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,440
we only ate instant noodles.

371
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:34,400
That's why I would still gag
whenever I smell instant noodles.

372
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,600
I understand all that.

373
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:41,120
But now you're broke
and can only eat instant noodles.

374
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,920
What does that have to do with me?

375
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,120
I...

376
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,960
Does that mean I can't eat anymore?

377
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:51,520
Eat up.

378
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,880
My uncle said that a good-for-nothing

379
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,840
won't starve if he is thick-skinned.

380
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:04,480
I'm buying you a meal

381
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,360
not because you're shameless.

382
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:08,440
It's because I have something to say.

383
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,560
Don't tell me...

384
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,520
Are you confessing to me?

385
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,000
It's about that.

386
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:25,600
Okay, let's do it.

387
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Ms. Cai Minmin.

388
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,680
After thorough consideration,
I have decided to notify you.

389
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:36,160
If you continue to spread rumors
about me liking you,

390
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,720
I will use legal means
to protect my reputation.

391
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,160
Spread rumors?

392
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:46,960
If it has been shared over 500 times,
I can file a lawsuit.

393
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,760
It's not a rumor.

394
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,480
Don't you like me?

395
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:55,320
When did I say that I like you
or tell others so?

396
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,520
It was your own speculation, little kid.

397
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,280
So do you really not like me?

398
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:05,880
I like you.

399
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,680
All teachers like their cute students.

400
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:13,960
I see.

401
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,480
Why do you seem disappointed?

402
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:20,560
Of course I am.

403
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,560
It's good to be liked by someone.

404
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,800
But this is good too.

405
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:32,320
I didn't dare to ask you for help
in case you would misunderstand me.

406
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:34,280
Now, I don't have to worry anymore.

407
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,160
So can I eat at your house?

408
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,400
No.

409
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:52,800
AI MEIXIANG

410
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,120
Hello, Ms. Ai.

411
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:01,600
I was just about to send you
the design contract.

412
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,720
We can sign it if there are no problems.

413
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,320
Don't worry.

414
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,760
We're giving you the best material
in the market at the lowest price.

415
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:12,840
At 7:30 p.m.?

416
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:14,560
Okay, sure.

417
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,640
I will come with our designer.

418
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,720
Okay, I'll see you later.

419
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,440
Bye.

420
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,440
-Chang Huan.
-Yes?

421
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:27,080
I'm meeting the client at 7:30 p.m.
to finalize the contract.

422
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:29,680
She wants to discuss with a designer.

423
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,720
-Wait for me while I print the contract.
-Hey.

424
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,040
Tonight?

425
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,360
Does it matter?

426
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:36,720
You're free anyway.

427
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:37,800
Chang Huan!

428
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,480
Are you done?

429
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:40,680
I bought tickets for 7:00 p.m.

430
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:43,800
Qingqing.

431
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:47,160
Cong Xiao just told me
that I have to meet a client.

432
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:49,840
It's fine.

433
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,000
Have fun, you two.

434
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:53,320
I'll see if other designers are free.

435
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,520
If that's the case,
then the project won't be his.

436
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,640
Qingqing has already gotten the tickets.

437
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,880
I can't take this project.

438
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,200
Save the next one for me.

439
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,080
Okay.

440
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,760
It's fine, I'll go on your behalf.

441
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,720
I'll tell you the client's requests.

442
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:12,800
Enjoy your date.

443
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,840
You taught me so much
during my internship.

444
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,400
I don't mind helping you out.

445
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:20,640
Thank you then.

446
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,080
Thank you.

447
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:25,120
Okay, have fun.

448
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:26,840
Yes, ma'am!

449
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,480
-Let's go.
-All right.

450
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,640
Cong Xiao.

451
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,960
-Yes?
-Have you printed it?

452
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,480
I'm on it.

453
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:24,960
Little Godmother and Godmother are here!

454
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,720
Hello, Little Godmother and Godmother.

455
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:30,160
Did you miss Little Godmother
and Godmother?

456
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,160
Yes, I did.

457
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,840
How much?

458
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,240
This much.

459
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:36,640
That much?

460
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:37,800
Here, give me a kiss.

461
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:39,760
What about me?

462
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,400
Good girl.

463
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:43,480
Watch Dad dance.

464
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:10,680
Good!

465
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,680
Fanxing, Ms. Song, long time no see.

466
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,880
Fanfan, I saw your posts.

467
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,920
You're here even after 10:00 p.m.

468
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,440
Kids shouldn't sleep so late.

469
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,720
Peanut just loves sleeping
on the studio floor, right?

470
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,480
-No.
-See?

471
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:36,000
Kid, you betray me
when your godmothers are here.

472
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:39,480
You should go home and accompany Xiaoyu.

473
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,400
A pregnant woman needs to be cared for.

474
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,320
It's fine, my mom is home.

475
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:46,000
Did she marry you or your mom?

476
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,960
I will obey you, Ms. Song.

477
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:54,840
After the dance competition ends,
I'll definitely be home by 9:00 p.m.

478
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:55,880
Do supervise me.

479
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,440
Peanut, look.

480
00:29:58,520 --> 00:29:59,960
Your dad is only a year older than you.

481
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:04,200
Fanxing, didn't you want
to practice social dance?

482
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:07,320
It has been a while, so I'm rusty now.

483
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,680
Ms. Kou can guide you.

484
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:10,040
She's the studio's co-founder.

485
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,880
Kou, come here.

486
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:13,320
Just a minute.

487
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:16,320
What's up?

488
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:17,960
She's my friend, Fanxing.

489
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,960
-Hello.
-Can you practice social dance with her?

490
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:22,280
-She's going to a ball.
-Have you learned it before?

491
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:24,680
Yes, but I haven't practiced in a while.

492
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:26,520
-It's fine, come on.
-Okay.

493
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,120
Be careful.

494
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:30,240
Go on.

495
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:33,600
Ms. Song, please take care of Peanut.

496
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:34,800
I'll be practicing.

497
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:37,720
Everyone, get up.

498
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,720
Let's repeat that move.

499
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,120
Let's see how much you remember.

500
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,440
All right, where were we?

501
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:52,040
AI MEIXIANG

502
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,120
There are two copies.

503
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,440
I'll keep this copy.

504
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:02,720
Please keep the other.

505
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:06,560
My classmate, He Fanxing,
works at your company,

506
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,240
so I'm not worried.

507
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,400
But seriously, Cong Xiao.

508
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,440
Your information is not up-to-date.

509
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,640
She already has a boyfriend.

510
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:17,960
Last weekend,
at our class rep's birthday party,

511
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:19,360
she brought him!

512
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,880
I was so embarrassed.

513
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,760
Ms. He has a boyfriend?

514
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:26,320
I didn't know that.

515
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,680
That's why you're not up-to-date.

516
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,880
He's the boss of an advertising firm.

517
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,880
His name is Ye Luming.

518
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:36,240
In my opinion, they don't suit each other.

519
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,400
I know Fanxing well.

520
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:40,080
She's very innocent.

521
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:44,040
But that Mr. Ye is obviously
not a simple man.

522
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:46,840
I don't think so. They're just friends.

523
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,440
Did you just assume it?

524
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,400
Let me tell you.

525
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:53,880
I told everyone in our group
that she doesn't have a boyfriend.

526
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:57,000
She got mad and brought her boyfriend.

527
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:59,920
She just couldn't stay calm.

528
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,760
How cute.

529
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,360
How can I assume these things?

530
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:05,040
I saw it with my own eyes.

531
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:15,040
Do you think that Ms. Kou is pretty?

532
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:17,080
Yes, she's quite pretty.

533
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,480
Look, she's only 23 years old.

534
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:24,400
She just graduated,
but she's already the co-founder.

535
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,440
How amazing.

536
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:29,680
Is it possible that she likes Shen Fanfan?

537
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,680
No way!

538
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:36,880
A young lady like her wouldn't want
to be a stepmom.

539
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,080
Forget it.

540
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:42,560
Go on, tell me about
your class rep's birthday party.

541
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,960
That was it.

542
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:49,040
Ye went and he told them
that he was my boyfriend.

543
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:51,200
Did you know? I almost walked out.

544
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:52,880
I just don't get it.

545
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:55,760
Why must I prove to them
that I have a boyfriend?

546
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:57,680
That Amy.

547
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,680
Did I offend her?

548
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:01,720
Hang on.

549
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,560
I don't think the problem is Amy.

550
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,120
The problem here is Ye.

551
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,480
Ye?

552
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:09,800
What's wrong with him?

553
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,240
Is it because he lied for me?

554
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,200
Doesn't he like you?

555
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:15,680
No.

556
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,920
We're more like comrades
who met on a blind date.

557
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,160
Look.

558
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:23,320
He's your close male friend
who is always a call away.

559
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:25,560
He pretended to be your boyfriend
to help you.

560
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:28,480
These fulfill all the signs of a crush.

561
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:31,320
No way, he likes someone else.

562
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:32,720
Who? Have you seen her?

563
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:36,240
Or should I ask,
have you seen pictures of her?

564
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:38,800
I never asked.

565
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,000
As his best friend,

566
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:44,680
has he ever told you about
how he met this woman

567
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:46,640
or how they're getting along?

568
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,360
We never talked about that.

569
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:53,040
He definitely likes you.

570
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,400
You're dumb.

571
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,280
No way.

572
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:59,320
Between a male and a female,

573
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:03,480
there must be a friendship like ours
where they help each other out.

574
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:07,440
I'm not easily deceived
like an innocent girl.

575
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:24,040
Mr. Liu? Yes, we're on our way.

576
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:25,800
There's a slight traffic jam.

577
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,200
I'm so sorry.

578
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,560
See you later.

579
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:30,320
Sure.

580
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:32,400
<i>Ms. He has a boyfriend?</i>

581
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:34,560
<i>He's the boss of an advertising firm.</i>

582
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,600
His name is Ye Luming.

583
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:41,000
I told everyone in our group
that she doesn't have a boyfriend.

584
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:43,040
She got mad and brought her boyfriend.

585
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:47,920
Does he think that we're Flash
who can be there after he calls?

586
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:52,480
Intern, mind your manners.

587
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,920
Why does it suddenly feel so grim?

588
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,640
A lovesick teenager.

589
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,000
Aren't you the same?

590
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:07,840
What about me?

591
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,320
Can you and Cong Xiao be any more obvious?

592
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,920
My seat is near you two.

593
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,760
The heavy mood has already spread to me.

594
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:18,040
You're leaving soon anyway.

595
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,080
If you like her, just pursue her.

596
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,680
Are you an animal?

597
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:24,680
Humans can't  live on just instincts.

598
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:27,760
So you admit it.

599
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:30,480
Hey, you finally admit
that you like Cong Xiao.

600
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:33,640
Can you be more reasonable?

601
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:36,080
Did I tell anyone about you and Ms. He?

602
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,360
Our bus just left.

603
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:58,400
Mr. Liu.

604
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,760
I'm so sorry to give you this call.

605
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:03,560
I just got hit by a motorcycle.

606
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,040
I'm at the hospital now.

607
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:08,200
I'm fine, it's only a minor injury.

608
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,240
Don't worry.

609
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:10,640
How about this?

610
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:12,320
I'll meet you tomorrow.

611
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,120
Sure.

612
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,200
Thank you.

613
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,560
See you tomorrow then.

614
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:17,800
Okay.

615
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,360
Why are you smirking?

616
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:27,600
Relationship between adults
are usually maintained with white lies.

617
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,400
That's why you told Cong Xiao
that you didn't like her.

618
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,040
How amazing.

619
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:36,800
What else can I do?

620
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:41,000
If you insist on confessing knowing that
she just wants to be friends,

621
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:42,520
it's a lose-lose situation.

622
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,960
Being friends is the safest way to go.

623
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:47,960
What about Qingqing?

624
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:54,240
I have to give myself a chance
to like someone else, right?

625
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,160
Or else, I would be so pitiful.

626
00:36:57,360 --> 00:37:00,680
When you say you love someone,
you usually love yourself more.

627
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:03,560
You think more about yourself
when making decisions.

628
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:07,120
These things should be left unsaid.

629
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,800
Why did you have to point it out?

630
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Aren't you the same?

631
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:12,320
Of course not.

632
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:18,400
I think so.

633
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,160
I don't know.

634
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,760
Actually, you don't have to lie to me.

635
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:32,000
I know you more than you think I do.

636
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:33,360
Do you?

637
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:36,200
Okay, tell me then.

638
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,680
What are the things you know about me?

639
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,080
Tell me this first.

640
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,560
How did you explain to Ms. He?

641
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:42,880
Explain what?

642
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:46,240
About hugging another woman
and receiving gifts.

643
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,240
What?

644
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,480
I saw it.

645
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,280
The other day at a cafÃ© near our site,

646
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,440
a beauty brought you some branded stuff.

647
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:56,680
Wasn't that

648
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:58,760
Ms. Wu from Aijia?

649
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:01,160
When she came to our office,

650
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:03,520
you somehow disappeared.

651
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:07,360
That's true, Meiyin gave me clothes.

652
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:11,360
But I didn't tell Fanxing.

653
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:16,920
I told her.

654
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,440
What did you tell her?

655
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:23,360
I just said that a pretty lady
gave you presents

656
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:25,960
and that you hugged each other.

657
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:28,600
No, wait.

658
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:31,080
Didn't Ms. He confront you?

659
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:33,520
She didn't.

660
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,800
I thought you explained it to her.

661
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:46,560
That's why you didn't fight or break up.

662
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:51,400
Big mouth.

663
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:54,280
Yuan Song.

664
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:55,920
I'm sorry.

665
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,440
Do you want a drink?

666
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:00,720
Let's forget this after we drink.

667
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:05,520
I think Fanxing trusts you,
so she didn't ask.

668
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:25,960
<i>Your dad is incredible,</i>

669
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:28,840
but you shouldn't get ice cream
all over your mouth.

670
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,400
My foundation is expensive!

671
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:36,200
I wanted to wipe your mouth,
not your foundation.

672
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:06,560
Cong Xiao, your parcel.

673
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:07,760
Thank you.

674
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,840
So how was the meeting with the client?

675
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:12,840
She signed it.

676
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,160
As expected of Cong Xiao.

677
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,040
You always get the clients.

678
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:20,680
Chang Huan got lucky this time.

679
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:22,080
He should buy you a meal.

680
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,880
How was the movie yesterday?

681
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:27,120
I couldn't focus.

682
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:30,200
The movie isn't important.

683
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:33,800
What's important is
who you watch it with, right?

684
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:35,840
After the movie last night,

685
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:39,040
we also went to a popular restaurant--

686
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:40,080
Qingqing.

687
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,120
I have to revise the contract.

688
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:43,880
It's quite urgent, so I can't chat.

689
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:46,080
Okay, go ahead with your work.

690
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:47,360
I'll go back to work.

691
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,920
If Ms. He sees me,
she will nag at me again.

692
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,240
HE FANXING

693
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:02,160
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

694
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:11,720
DO YOU FEEL EMBARRASSED BEING WITH ME?

695
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:19,720
I THINK WE...

696
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:34,360
Handsome boy,
why are you drinking alone here?

697
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:35,920
Meiyin, you're here.

698
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:41,920
You have been meeting me frequently.

699
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:45,240
I should really thank
that girlfriend of yours.

700
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:50,760
That feels good.

701
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:54,360
A glass of champagne, please.

702
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:55,920
Okay.

703
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,120
You look unhappy. What's wrong?

704
00:41:58,600 --> 00:41:59,520
Did you fight?

705
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:02,440
We didn't.

706
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:04,720
-Thank you.
-Here you go.

707
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:06,000
Please enjoy.

708
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:09,720
Last week,
at her classmate's birthday party,

709
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:13,440
she brought a man along
saying that he's her boyfriend.

710
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:16,960
That was my reaction too.

711
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:18,240
She cheated on you?

712
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:20,200
She's not that kind of person.

713
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:21,920
I'm her first love.

714
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:26,720
Seriously.

715
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:28,160
First love?

716
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:32,040
I remember someone once told me

717
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,480
that he wanted to marry me.

718
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:37,920
Meiyin, let's not bring that up again.

719
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:41,640
Fine, I'll stop teasing you.

720
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,920
If she didn't cheat,
then what was that about?

721
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:47,000
I guess she doesn't believe in me.

722
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:49,520
I'm younger than her.

723
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:53,560
So she doesn't dare to announce it
or let me meet her friends.

724
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:57,240
She has a real boyfriend,
but she brought a fake one.

725
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:58,920
Isn't it ridiculous?

726
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:01,560
The problem between the two of you

727
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:04,040
is that you're only giving her
a sense of belonging,

728
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:05,680
not a sense of security.

729
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,440
Isn't the sense of security
the foundation for a sense of belonging?

730
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:13,960
A sense of belonging is, "I am yours."

731
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:17,040
But a sense of security is,
"You are mine."

732
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:19,400
They are two opposite feelings.

733
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:21,880
