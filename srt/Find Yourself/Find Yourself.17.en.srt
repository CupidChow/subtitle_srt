1
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,200
Did you guys

2
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,200
have a good dinner last night?

3
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,320
I took her to a seafood place

4
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,240
and sent her home after that.

5
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,320
How is that?

6
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,800
Did I make you proud?

7
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,040
Are you happy now?

8
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,120
You're so nice.

9
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,360
-Thank you!
-I'm not nice!

10
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,480
For the whole day yesterday,

11
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,600
I felt really awful.

12
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,920
I let my friend down.

13
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,560
I let my boyfriend down.

14
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,320
I think that whenever
it comes to relationships,

15
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,880
I...

16
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,720
I become extremely stupid.

17
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,960
The harder I try,

18
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,000
the more mistakes I make.

19
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:17,760
I just want the people around me
to be happy.

20
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,040
At the very least,
they're not hurt because of me.

21
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:25,040
It would be great
if I could see the future now.

22
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,120
I'd really like to see

23
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,520
what awaits me in the future.

24
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:05,600
I'll treat you better in the future
and I won't trick you anymore.

25
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,280
-Morning, Cong Xiao.
-Morning.

26
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:16,840
<i>Thank you.</i>

27
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,200
How did the blind date go yesterday?

28
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,280
I think it went well.

29
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,280
We went to a fancy restaurant last night.

30
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:28,480
He pulled out the chair,
opened the door for me,

31
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,920
and even paid for dinner.

32
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:33,040
After he drove me home,
he didn't ask to come up.

33
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,520
A true gentleman.

34
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,480
How nice!

35
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,000
It's okay. We'll just be friends first.

36
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,200
So you really don't like Chang Huan.

37
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,520
I can feel at ease then.

38
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,640
I'm sorry.

39
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,280
It's a woman's intuition.

40
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,200
I thought you liked him too.

41
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,360
Him? How is that possible?

42
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,480
Chang Huan is not bad
in terms of personality.

43
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:59,920
But he doesn't fit the criteria
I'm looking for in a partner at all.

44
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,120
He's just a stingy geek.

45
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,120
You're the only one
who doesn't mind that he's poor.

46
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:05,880
Morning, Chang Huan.

47
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,520
Morning.

48
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,760
<i>Thank you.</i>

49
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,680
So what if I'm poor?

50
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:13,760
Did I borrow your money?

51
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,480
I'll get to work.

52
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,720
Cong Xiao, wait.

53
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,640
Let me tell you a secret.

54
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,520
A secret?

55
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,280
<i>Is someone talking about me?</i>

56
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,640
<i>I thought I didn't let anything slip.</i>

57
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,520
<i>There weren't any reactions
from He Canyang.</i>

58
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,640
<i>No news means good news.</i>

59
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,200
<i>Or should I just ask Yuan Song?</i>

60
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,480
<i>How exactly did I get home?</i>

61
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,320
<i>What happened after I forcibly kissed him?</i>

62
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,880
<i>That was so embarrassing!</i>

63
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,760
<i>Why does he come to work so early?</i>

64
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,360
<i>Isn't he an uninhibited guy
who comes and goes like the wind?</i>

65
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:26,960
Ms. He.

66
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,240
Stop hiding it. We all know already.

67
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,640
You all...

68
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,640
You all know already?

69
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,880
Yes, the photo was sent to the group
last weekend.

70
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,240
Ms. He!

71
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,600
Did you mute our gossip group?

72
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,160
That's not it, Bai.

73
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,240
I thought

74
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,800
it would have a negative impact
to talk about it in the company,

75
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,480
so I didn't announce it.

76
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,320
Moreover,

77
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:03,720
it's not necessary to tell everyone
about these things, right?

78
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,120
You're right.

79
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,120
If the boss wants to sell his company,

80
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,640
he doesn't need to discuss it with us.

81
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,680
Sell...

82
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:13,840
the company?

83
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,880
Yes.

84
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,240
<i>That's her, Wu Meiyin.</i>

85
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,320
<i>The head of investment
of Aijia Decoration.</i>

86
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,080
<i>Aijia's staff said,</i>

87
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,520
<i>they'd hold their breath
whenever they see her.</i>

88
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,520
<i>They don't even dare
to share the air with her.</i>

89
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,280
<i>The person beside Mr. Li
is our boss, right?</i>

90
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:42,080
<i>I only met him once
during the annual dinner two years ago.</i>

91
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,840
<i>He's our boss?</i>

92
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,520
<i>Isn't he in Australia?</i>

93
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:50,080
<i>I heard he owns over 100 acres of land
used for kiwi planting.</i>

94
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,920
<i>I don't understand the rich.</i>

95
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,440
<i>Even old folks in my village
refuse to farm.</i>

96
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,520
<i>We're being acquired by Aijia.</i>

97
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,520
<i>And you're still concerned about kiwis?</i>

98
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,680
<i>Aijia?</i>

99
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,720
Are you kidding me?

100
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,200
Aijia?

101
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,080
You just found out?

102
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,640
Everyone already knows.

103
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,040
I have too many groups so I muted them.

104
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,360
Why Aijia?

105
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,360
What about Aijia?

106
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,920
Aijia is going to buy our company!

107
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:33,800
Mr. Zhou.

108
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:37,600
When can you give me
past years' financial statements?

109
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,400
Before this weekend.

110
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,160
-Okay, be quick.
-Sure.

111
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,240
Bai.

112
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,120
I asked Ms. He to meet our major client.

113
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,360
Please inform her.

114
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:49,000
I need the profiles of every staff here.

115
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,480
As for the designers,

116
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,000
attach their best work
behind their profiles.

117
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,040
Sure. What about the interns?

118
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,360
There's no need.

119
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,760
What's wrong?

120
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,080
What's with the long faces?

121
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,960
We're being acquired.

122
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,320
We're not going bankrupt.

123
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,440
Joining Aijia

124
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,520
is very beneficial for your careers
in the long run.

125
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,400
Mr. Li.

126
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,200
We don't need to move
to Aijia's office, do we?

127
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,840
The house I bought
is just behind our office.

128
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,880
I thought I could walk to work.

129
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:35,000
-Currently, I haven't--
-Mr. Li.

130
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:38,520
Will Aijia take charge of the procurement?

131
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,000
Then...

132
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,360
Am I going to lose my job?

133
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,120
Not to that extent.

134
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:48,120
But I think a demotion or transfer

135
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,880
will be inevitable.

136
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,320
It's like the boss marrying off
his daughter

137
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:55,080
and we're the dowries the in-laws despise.

138
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,440
Calm down.

139
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,360
Don't think too much.

140
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,760
Everything is still under discussion.

141
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:08,280
I'll strive to protect
our employees' best interests.

142
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:17,200
<i>I've imagined myself being single at 32.</i>

143
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,560
<i>But I've never imagined</i>

144
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:22,840
<i>losing my job at 32!</i>

145
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,240
Forget it.

146
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,480
Wake up. Get yourself together.

147
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,480
What was I doing again?

148
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:40,960
<i>He Fanxing,</i>

149
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,720
<i>I may be ten years younger,</i>

150
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,240
<i>but I'm letting you know</i>

151
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:46,280
<i>that I'll conquer our hurdle</i>

152
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,840
<i>and stand in front of you.</i>

153
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,600
<i>Eighty-five days from now,</i>

154
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,480
<i>you'll be willing to tell everyone</i>

155
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:52,680
<i>that I'm your boyfriend.</i>

156
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,080
<i>Eighty-five days from now?</i>

157
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:03,280
MS. HE, SEE YOU AT BOOK AND FLOWER CAFÉ
AT 7:30 P.M. TONIGHT. COME ALONE.

158
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,480
Ms. He.

159
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,520
Ms. He.

160
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,240
I'd like to take this afternoon off.

161
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,280
Okay.

162
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,840
Thank you, Ms. He!

163
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,960
Ms. He.

164
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:45,000
We need you to sign this.

165
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,240
Sure, Mr. Qu.

166
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,560
Okay. I'll contact you again.

167
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,720
Thank you.

168
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:56,560
Cutie pie, it's a prank.

169
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,640
The engineering team always exceeds
the beverage budget.

170
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:02,200
It's no use even if your director came
to see Ms. He himself.

171
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,360
Hey, I'm not mistaken, right?

172
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,560
This says "He Fanxing",

173
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,000
not "go to hell", right?

174
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,600
<i>Who is it?</i>

175
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,240
<i>Who?</i>

176
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:19,960
<i>Who?</i>

177
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,800
On the bright side,

178
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,160
being acquired isn't that bad.

179
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,160
Big companies may not be
as flexible as the small ones,

180
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:41,320
but they have good welfare and pension.

181
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:45,160
It's just like getting into
a second-tier university,

182
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,920
then it merges with a top university.

183
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,800
Even your diploma becomes more valuable.

184
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,200
I heard it's hard to get into Aijia.

185
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,160
You're too young and naive.

186
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,120
I've done my research.

187
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:01,360
Aijia's administration department
is organized and has good pay.

188
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,000
Everyone has their own function.

189
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,240
All five receptionists
are at least 165cm tall.

190
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,360
They represent their company proudly.

191
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,600
What can you do there? Sweep the floor?

192
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,120
Can you do that?

193
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,040
So you mean we'll all lose our jobs?

194
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,800
Not just us.

195
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,480
I'm afraid even Ms. He

196
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:23,240
will have to receive severance pay.

197
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,800
You are thinking too much.

198
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:34,600
Didn't Aijia recruit the staff
from the previous firm they acquired?

199
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,000
You're too young and naive.

200
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,120
That is what usually happens.

201
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,800
But if the staff
doesn't meet their standards,

202
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,480
they could be fired anytime.

203
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,920
So just work hard.

204
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,680
Aijia has a strict
performance assessment system

205
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,800
and lowest score elimination policy.

206
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:54,200
All of us are like goldfishes
in a fishbowl

207
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,760
being dumped into a pond

208
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,520
with red-eared sliders
waiting at the bottom.

209
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,120
We'll all be torn apart.

210
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,360
Especially me.

211
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,280
I snatched a client away
from their manager before.

212
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,840
I've been blacklisted
by their marketing department for a while.

213
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,320
If I work in Aijia,

214
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,240
they'll deliberately
make things hard for me.

215
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,680
I'd better type up my resume
and get a new job.

216
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,160
Do you guys know anyone in Aijia?

217
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,480
Go get some reliable news.

218
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,600
Yuan Song.

219
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:22,960
Do you know anyone there?

220
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,360
No.

221
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:35,400
I know an assistant designer in Aijia.

222
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:39,120
I heard their boss has never displayed
any other expressions

223
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:43,280
aside from looking unhappy
or pulling faces.

224
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,120
He either has long-term constipation

225
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,560
or is unsatisfied with his sex life.

226
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,160
He's a pervert.

227
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,760
He wants all the skirts of female staff

228
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,160
to be below the knees.

229
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:57,760
-Let me tell you, he's really--
-Enjoy your meal.

230
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:01,880
What's wrong with him?

231
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,200
Is he shy?

232
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,040
That's enough.
Everything is not finalized yet.

233
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:09,240
Let's not discuss company affairs here
and make ourselves worried.

234
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,840
Now, just do your job well.

235
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:14,120
All right.
Let's guard our last posts well!

236
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:26,800
<i>Who on earth found the card?</i>

237
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:42,560
<i>And why did it appear now
after such a long time?</i>

238
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,680
<i>Just when the company
is about to be acquired.</i>

239
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,600
<i>I can feel</i>

240
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,480
<i>that I am shrouded by conspiracy.</i>

241
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,360
<i>I can feel a shiver down my spine.</i>

242
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,720
It's you?

243
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:51,000
Me? What do you mean?

244
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,640
Are you waiting for someone?

245
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,240
Yes.

246
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,600
I'm here to get coffee with Chang Huan.

247
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,200
The coffee is ready. I'll go ahead.

248
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,560
-Okay.
-I'll get going.

249
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,160
Didn't you leave already?

250
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,960
I'm waiting for someone.
Go sit somewhere else.

251
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,080
You're still here?

252
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:53,600
Ms. He.

253
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,960
Did you see the card?

254
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,600
It was you?

255
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,520
Yes.

256
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,200
I found it.

257
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,200
At first,

258
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,400
I wanted to pretend
like I didn't know anything.

259
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:08,920
Then, tell me.

260
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,080
What do you want?

261
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,280
I guess what I'm doing

262
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,520
is being a busybody.

263
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,880
A busybody?

264
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,120
You're not threatening me?

265
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,400
Why would I do that?

266
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:31,400
Then why did you slip the card
in my notebook

267
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,040
and ask me to come alone?

268
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,320
I was afraid you'd feel awkward.

269
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,520
Besides, didn't you say
that private matters

270
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,040
can't be discussed at work?

271
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:42,960
I asked you to come alone
because I was scared

272
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,040
that Yuan Song would come too.

273
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,200
In that case,

274
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,160
I'd feel even more awkward.

275
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,040
Then,

276
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,000
why exactly did you ask me to come here?

277
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:56,920
If you want to pretend
that you don't know anything,

278
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,520
then just go on with it.

279
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,400
I didn't want to be a busybody.

280
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,480
But you're a nice person, Ms. He.

281
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,920
I was conflicted.

282
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,520
Get to the point.

283
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,480
Previously,

284
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,680
I saw a woman meeting Yuan Song.

285
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,680
They didn't seem to be just friends.

286
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,360
She seemed to be giving him gifts

287
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:24,840
like clothes and shoes.

288
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,240
Yesterday, I saw this photo in the group.

289
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,360
I realized that it's the same woman,

290
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,480
Wu Meiyin from Aijia.

291
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,120
<i>Do you guys know anyone in Aijia?</i>

292
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,600
Go get some reliable news.

293
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,200
Yuan Song.

294
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:46,720
Do you know anyone there?

295
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,480
No.

296
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,840
So at lunch earlier,

297
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,040
you asked him that on purpose?

298
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,000
Yes.

299
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:59,760
But I don't know why the kid lied.

300
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,480
Of course,

301
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,360
I might be wrong.

302
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,480
She could also be

303
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,600
his relative or something like that.

304
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,920
If she was his relative,

305
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,360
why did he deny it?

306
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,560
You have a point.

307
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,480
Chang Huan.

308
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,920
I know you're not a busybody.

309
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,960
Thanks for telling me and being a friend.

310
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,480
Don't worry. I'll take care of it.

311
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,320
But...

312
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:37,240
I hope you can keep this a secret
and act like you don't know anything.

313
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,480
I understand. Don't worry.

314
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,680
Thank you.

315
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:44,120
I'll get going then.

316
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:03,440
Really?

317
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,560
I'm sorry, Professor He.

318
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,320
Don't worry about it.

319
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,560
Just talk to He Fanxing tomorrow.

320
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,200
Okay, I will.

321
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,600
What are your plans?

322
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,320
I don't know yet.

323
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,320
That's a surprise.

324
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,400
Plans can never keep up
with the changes in life.

325
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,120
You're right.

326
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,880
You'd better explain it
to He Fanxing tomorrow.

327
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,360
I will.

328
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,440
Right.

329
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,920
Sorry for the trouble that night.

330
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,920
<i>-Get together!
-Get together!</i>

331
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,680
-Get together!
-Get together!

332
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:48,120
Friends, are you good?

333
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,480
-Good!
-Good!

334
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,960
He's my boyfriend. Is he handsome?

335
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,600
-Yes!
-Yes!

336
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:55,400
My friends are here.
I have to entertain them.

337
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,280
Hey!

338
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:03,760
Come on!

339
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,800
-Drink up!
-Come on!

340
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,360
Where's He Fanxing?

341
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,200
Military training in college

342
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,920
is a devil training camp.

343
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,200
I don't get it.

344
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,720
Why can't I fake fainting?

345
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,000
I'd faint after the whole afternoon
in the sun!

346
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,440
Yes. Look, Fanxing.

347
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:28,200
I still haven't recovered
my original skin color

348
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,120
from being tanned last year.

349
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:35,080
Your skin is so firm and smooth.

350
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,600
Fanxing, you're pretty too.

351
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,120
If you didn't tell us your age,

352
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:41,520
we would've thought you were our senior.

353
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,720
If I could look like her when I turn 30,

354
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,360
I'd be more than happy.

355
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:46,960
-Ignore her.
-Really?

356
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,440
He Canyang, stand up!

357
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,160
Present!

358
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,640
See that?

359
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,800
He's my little brother.

360
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,840
Don't be deceived by how decent he looks.

361
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,320
He's actually a scumbag!

362
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,840
I don't know her. Let's go.

363
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:07,200
Let him be. Let's drink!

364
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,840
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

365
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:13,480
He Fanxing only gets wasted
when she is in an awful mood.

366
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,720
It's like going into another dimension.

367
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:16,920
Do you get it?

368
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,840
You have to role-play with her.

369
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:22,240
Marching like a veteran
is still all right.

370
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,560
Last time,

371
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,640
she became a boxer.

372
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,600
Hello, Song Xue.

373
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:11,960
I sent you a message.
Why didn't you reply to me?

374
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:13,840
I have so much to tell you.

375
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:16,040
I was in the dressing room,
so I didn't hear it.

376
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:18,720
I'll be on air soon.
I'll talk to you later, okay?

377
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:20,440
-<i>Bye.</i>
-Okay.

378
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,000
One, two, three!

379
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,600
You hit your brother, Peanut.

380
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:37,920
Let me listen to him.

381
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,080
He kicked me!

382
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,320
It's time to shower!

383
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,560
You have school tomorrow.

384
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,360
FANXING

385
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,400
Hurry up!

386
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,040
You're flying!

387
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,240
Did your dad bring you out?

388
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,120
What are you doing here?

389
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:11,880
I'm in a bad mood.

390
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,840
I don't want Mom and Dad to see me.

391
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,320
Because your company has been acquired?

392
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,560
How did you know?

393
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,280
I walked the dog with Yuan Song.

394
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,280
Yuan Song?

395
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,760
Why? Are you worried
about losing your job?

396
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,680
A small part of me is.

397
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,000
I feel like

398
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:40,280
misfortune won't come alone.

399
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,120
As if things are out of my control.

400
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,600
That's right.

401
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,320
Just take whatever life throws at you.

402
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,760
Did you think that life
was under your control?

403
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,080
That was an illusion.

404
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:56,440
Humans can only control
a very small part of it.

405
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,600
After I graduated from college,

406
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:07,440
I joined Amazing Decoration.

407
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,920
This is the only job I've ever had.

408
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,280
And it has been ten years since.

409
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,880
The company has been growing steadily.

410
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:21,080
So I never thought that one day,

411
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,400
I'd lose my job.

412
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,640
After it's acquired,

413
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:28,360
don't they just put their name in
but your operations remain the same

414
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:29,960
and you just need
to submit annual reports?

415
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,840
Even if the new company assigns someone
to manage your company,

416
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:37,000
they might lay off some staff,
but not directors like you.

417
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,920
This company is different.

418
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,760
The boss takes management very seriously.

419
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:46,640
Usually, after moving to the headquarters,

420
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:49,360
they'd set up a new department
for unified management.

421
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:52,240
Their administrative department is huge.

422
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:55,520
Someone like me can only be
a rank-and-file employee

423
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,080
in their company.

424
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,000
At this age,

425
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,520
I've gotten used to being a director.

426
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,320
How can I be a rank-and-file employee?

427
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:06,560
You're right.

428
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,600
After getting to a certain age,
aside from moving forward,

429
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,360
there's no room to move backwards.

430
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,240
Tell me.

431
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:17,400
Is this considered a midlife crisis?

432
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,800
Of course not.

433
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:21,880
Those people have
an entire family to feed.

434
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,000
That is a midlife crisis.

435
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:25,160
What's your crisis?
I can support you financially.

436
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,120
You will support me?

437
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:30,200
Of course!

438
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:31,720
Who else will?

439
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,160
I kicked you out
into the world first after all.

440
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:39,760
Usually, babies come out head first.

441
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,920
If you had really kicked me out
with your legs,

442
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:45,120
Mom would have had obstructed labor.

443
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:50,760
Never mind.

444
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:53,520
At least I finally have a man
who will support me financially.

445
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,320
This is what we'll do.

446
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,720
Call me Big Brother in the future.

447
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,640
And I'll always have your back.

448
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:04,680
How about that?

449
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:06,760
Sure.

450
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,680
Let's go home and talk to Mom and Dad.

451
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,440
If they agree, I'll call you that.

452
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:14,160
Why are you like this?

453
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,640
Why do you still tell on me
like when we were kids?

454
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:20,160
You were the one who always told on me
when we were kids.

455
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:24,200
Back then, I had so many chances
to start dating early,

456
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:25,760
but you ruined them all.

457
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:29,840
You read the love letters they sent me
and even forcibly kissed them.

458
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,080
You scared them off!

459
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:35,120
That was a really long time ago.

460
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,400
Why do you still remember them?

461
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,600
Don't be so petty.

462
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,240
You're the one to talk!

463
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,720
You made me look like the bad guy.

464
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,040
By the way,

465
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:49,400
my colleague said

466
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:52,200
that he saw a pretty lady

467
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:53,840
give Yuan Song some things.

468
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:55,800
Is it his girlfriend?

469
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,880
I don't think so.

470
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,840
The designer who's in charge of him

471
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,800
saw them near the site.

472
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,040
He said she gave him a lot of stuff.

473
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,200
They seemed close too.

474
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:14,640
Do you think

475
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:18,040
Yuan Song is cheating on his girlfriend?

476
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:22,320
The Yuan Song I know would never do that.

477
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,440
But men his age are unpredictable.

478
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:29,640
Is that lady thin,

479
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,800
has a small face and mid-length hair?

480
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:36,280
I think so.

481
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,920
That's his ex. She's still bothering him.

482
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:41,800
Ex-girlfriend?

483
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:46,640
They met while he was moonlighting
at a renovation firm.

484
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,800
She looks really normal.

485
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:52,040
She has great marketing skills,
earns a lot and is much older.

486
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:53,440
How can I put it?

487
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:54,720
She's really needy.

488
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:57,040
They have broken up,
but she still gives him things,

489
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,760
food and calls him every day.

490
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,840
She still won't give up
even after almost two years.

491
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,040
Then...

492
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:04,440
So,

493
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:08,040
Yuan Song probably wouldn't want
his girlfriend to know about this.

494
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,480
Of course!

495
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,080
Who would let their girlfriend
know about their ex?

496
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,880
He Canyang!

497
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:22,600
Don't you know that
he already has a girlfriend?

498
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:25,720
I do.

499
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,600
Did your parents not teach you?

500
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:31,680
Didn't they tell you not to touch
what's not yours?

501
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,400
-Hey.
-I--

502
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,920
Dongya, what are you talking about?

503
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
She's my sister.

504
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:37,760
Your sister?

505
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:40,840
What? Why don't you just say
that she's your aunt?

506
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,240
Look at her face!

507
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,640
-Your sister?
-What's wrong with my face?

508
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,040
What do you think?

509
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:48,000
Who are you trying to fool?

510
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,840
How old are you? Have you graduated yet?

511
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,640
Aren't you his student?

512
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,040
Did your parents pay your tuition fees

513
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:55,760
for you to seduce old men?

514
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:57,440
Dongya.

515
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:59,320
Do you want to see
our family photo at home?

516
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,400
Sure! Do you dare to show it to me?

517
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:05,120
Calm down.

518
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:09,760
I'll go change into something
He Canyang's sister would wear.

519
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:11,920
Let's go!

520
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:20,960
See?

521
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,680
The four of us

522
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,200
are all here.

523
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,520
Ms. Yang,

524
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:32,560
I'm sorry.

525
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,760
Our son caused you trouble.

526
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,160
No, Mrs. He.

527
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:38,920
I caused trouble for his sister.

528
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,440
I thought she was a student.

529
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:42,920
She looks so pretty and young.

530
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:45,440
Don't worry. I’m a reasonable person.

531
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,640
It was a misunderstanding.

532
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:49,240
Besides, you have broken up with Canyang.

533
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,480
Just call me by my name.

534
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,000
I didn't want to break up!

535
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:55,120
I was just trying to scare him.

536
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,920
I wanted him to console me.

537
00:31:58,560 --> 00:31:59,760
Canyang.

538
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:03,040
Didn't you say that when we first met,

539
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:06,240
you thought I resembled
<i>The Unknown Woman</i> by Ivan Kramskoi,

540
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:09,400
who is beautiful and mysterious?

541
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,560
I haven't fed the dog.

542
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,440
I'll go feed him now.

543
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:19,920
Go ahead.

544
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:23,000
I did the laundry,
but haven't hung them to dry yet.

545
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,280
-I have to hang them.
-Go ahead.

546
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,080
I'll remove my makeup.

547
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:32,280
-I...
-You...

548
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,080
I...

549
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:43,400
<i>Tomorrow is May 20.</i>

550
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,880
<i>An unofficial Valentine's Day.</i>

551
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:48,960
<i>I think...</i>

552
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,720
<i>I still have a chance
to celebrate it, right?</i>

553
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,040
RESIGNATION LETTER

554
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,880
I thought I'd finish the internship,

555
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,200
but there's too much to do
in preparation for my graduation.

556
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:05,240
So I've decided to resign.

557
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:12,280
I can let you proceed
with the resignation procedure.

558
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:16,120
And I'll still issue
the internship certificate.

559
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:22,960
But you still have some projects
on your hands.

560
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:23,960
So,

561
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:27,080
you need at least one month
to hand over the projects.

562
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:32,120
Okay, one month it is then.

563
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,360
Be honest with me.

564
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,400
Why are you quitting?

565
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:43,600
Is it because

566
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:45,840
our company will be acquired?

567
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,080
Actually,

568
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:55,120
there's someone
I don't wish to see in Aijia.

569
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:57,680
I didn't tell you

570
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,240
because I was embarrassed.

571
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:03,440
Initially, I was going to intern at Aijia.

572
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:06,120
Because--

573
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:08,960
Ms. He, it's time for your meeting.

574
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:11,680
All right, you go ahead.

575
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,520
All right. It's office hours.

576
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:21,440
Just focus on your work.

577
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,840
I didn't discuss my resignation
with you beforehand.

578
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,400
Are you angry at me?

579
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:33,520
No.

580
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:38,000
I've long known
that a talented person like you

581
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:39,400
wouldn't want to stay

582
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:41,680
in a small company
like Amazing Decoration.

583
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:45,760
Just do whatever you want.

584
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:49,360
I can be your stepping stone,

585
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,480
but never your stumbling block.

586
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:55,640
Let's go.

587
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,240
Don't be too forgiving.

588
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:10,840
I'm starting to feel

589
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,600
that you're too good for me.

590
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:24,920
Haven't you heard what they always say?

591
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,040
If you really love someone,

592
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:30,400
you'd immediately feel
that he's too good for you.

593
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:31,640
He Fanxing.

594
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:36,880
You're now radiating charm
from the inside and outside.

595
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,640
Who says so?

596
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,400
About his ex bothering him...

597
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:43,480
You know,

598
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:46,200
he'd rather quit than tell me the truth.

599
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:48,360
If you admire the wisdom of an old man,

600
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,000
then accept his crow’s feet.

601
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:53,200
If you like handsome young guys,
then accept his immaturity.

602
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:55,520
When they have nothing but youth,

603
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,200
their pride is really high.

604
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,920
But your boyfriend

605
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:04,240
seems to really like older women.

606
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:08,360
You're getting him
a lavish gift tomorrow, right?

607
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:10,120
No way!

608
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:12,760
Don't be mad. I was just curious.

609
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,320
But I'm quite glad.

610
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,800
The cabbage we've long nurtured

611
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:20,080
is finally getting eaten by a pig.

612
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:22,920
Who's the cabbage and who's the pig?

613
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:27,080
Don't let it slip in front of Xiaoyu.

614
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:28,440
I won't. My lips are sealed.

615
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:35,800
-How are you?
-The pregnant lady is here.

616
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:39,240
I'm starting to suspect
if I'm actually carrying a pig.

617
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:40,560
He's growing so fast.

618
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,600
He's crushing me so bad that
I need to go to the toilet every hour.

619
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:46,080
In a month,

620
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:49,160
I'll be eating and drinking on the toilet.

621
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,160
Is it that tough?

622
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,160
You have no idea.

623
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:55,200
The stretch marks on my stomach

624
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,920
make me look like a watermelon.

625
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:58,320
It's hideous!

626
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,520
Let me show you!

627
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:02,800
-Wait.
-No.

628
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,760
Hey, we're in public.

629
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:06,200
Mind your image.

630
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,480
You're wearing a dress.

631
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,440
I'm old anyway.

632
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:15,800
What image do I have?

633
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:17,360
You have no idea.

634
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:21,160
Last month, I brought food
when Shen Fanfan's mom was hospitalized.

635
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:24,720
The patient next to her
thought I was Shen Fanfan's aunt.

636
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:27,160
Do I look that old?

637
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:29,560
It really pissed me off.

638
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,200
All right, don't be mad.

639
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,840
After you give birth,

640
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:35,080
I'll give you a membership
to a beauty salon.

641
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:40,360
I knew you were the best.

642
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,560
What about you, He Fanxing?

643
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:49,760
Your brother promised me

644
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:52,200
that he'd buy insurance
for my second baby.

645
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:53,320
What about you?

646
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:56,160
Aren't you going to give me something?

647
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,280
Have you forgotten?
I'll be unemployed soon.

648
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:00,400
I'm broke.

649
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:03,840
You're worried about getting a job?

650
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:06,520
Getting a job isn't hard.

651
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,720
But getting a good job is hard.

652
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:12,000
I don't know what else to do

653
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:13,480
besides administration.

654
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,520
Just start your own business.

655
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:17,480
During college,
you wanted to be a florist.

656
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:20,000
I think running a store suits you.

657
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,760
I can invest in it.

658
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:25,080
No.

659
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:28,680
I think, for now,
I still can't handle the risk.

660
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:32,360
Take your time. There's no rush anyway.

661
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:35,280
I'm hungry again.

662
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:38,640
That's strange.

663
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:40,640
You're not going to rant
about Shen Fanfan?

664
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,440
Why would I do that?

665
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:46,880
Whenever you ask us out,
isn't ranting about him the main point?

666
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:51,240
Lately, he has been
a model father at home.

667
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:53,800
He has improved in leaps and bounds.

668
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:55,640
I don't know what to complain about him!

669
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:58,480
-For real?
-Is he possessed by a ghost?

670
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,280
Here.

671
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:06,960
Thirty thousand followers!

672
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:10,080
<i>Seems like Peanut has become
our dance studio's mascot!</i>

673
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:13,040
Every post has hundreds of comments.

674
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:14,200
That's amazing!

675
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:17,400
Most importantly,
he volunteered to take care of the kid.

676
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,160
Tell me.

677
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:22,280
Is Lady Luck shining down on me now?

678
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:26,880
Shen Fanfan has finally grown up.

679
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:29,280
Yes.

680
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:31,880
You know, I don't expect him

681
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:33,680
to become wealthy.

682
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:35,840
If we can be like your family,

683
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,920
living together peacefully,

684
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:38,960
that'd be great.

685
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,000
Yes.

686
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,360
Let's eat.

687
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:44,920
Eat up.

688
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:05,800
Luming, I'm leaving.
Is there anything else you need?

689
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:07,920
No.

690
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:09,600
I just finished my work.

691
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:11,640
I'll drive you home.

692
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,200
Sure.

693
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:24,200
Luming.

694
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:27,120
Tomorrow is May 20.
I'd like to take the afternoon off.

695
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:30,840
What do you have to do with that?

696
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:33,640
My boyfriend is taking me
to a photography exhibit.

697
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:35,640
Your boyfriend?

698
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,680
Since when did you have one?

699
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:39,720
Not long ago.

700
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:41,360
Don't worry. Your sister doesn't know.

701
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,600
Otherwise, I'm afraid
you'd suffer even more.

702
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:47,000
But she'd never forget
a day like tomorrow.

703
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:49,360
She'll surely ask
about your dating progress.

704
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:51,120
You'd better think about what to tell her.

705
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:54,240
For some, it's a celebration.

706
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:56,000
For me, it's a trial.

707
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,560
Luming.

708
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,000
When did you meet Cong Xiao?

709
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:03,200
Who?

710
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,440
Who's Cong Xiao?

711
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:07,840
She liked your post.

712
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,320
She's my junior who works in marketing
at Amazing Decoration.

713
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,600
We're very close.

714
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,520
I forgot her name.

715
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:20,040
She was the blind date
who was set up by the girl I like.

716
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:23,200
I'm sorry.

717
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:26,080
Hey.

718
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:28,680
This is the crucial period of my battle.

719
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,640
I could use her help.

720
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:32,560
Don't you go babbling to her.

721
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,400
If you ruin my plan,

722
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:37,160
think if you can handle the consequences.

723
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:39,040
Luming.

724
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:42,520
That is usually
what the villains say in movies.

725
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,400
And they usually die terribly.

726
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:49,600
Don't worry, Luming.

727
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:51,840
I know who's paying me my salary.

728
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:56,960
But you said

729
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,920
that you're very close to Cong Xiao.

730
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:00,640
Who's Cong Xiao?

731
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:05,640
Your leave is approved.

732
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:07,680
Thank you, Luming.

733
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:09,320
I'm your boss.

734
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:11,320
I'm your cousin.

735
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:12,560
Boss.

736
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:13,920
Cousin.

737
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,680
Done! Time to sleep!

738
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:52,280
Must you do this?

739
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:54,840
Isn't this what they do with firecrackers?

740
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:02,760
Just to make sure it feels like
the start of a new home renovation.

741
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:04,880
Has it been five minutes yet?

742
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:07,000
It has been long enough.

743
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:11,960
Done.

744
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:16,400
I woke up at six today. I'm so sleepy.

745
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:20,240
Why must today's auspicious hour
be 7:30 a.m.?

746
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:21,960
Didn't I tell you?

747
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:24,840
Tomorrow's a better day.
The auspicious hour is 9:20 a.m.

748
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:25,920
You wanted it done today.

749
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:29,440
May 20 is such an auspicious day.

750
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:30,920
Do you men even get that?

751
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:35,400
