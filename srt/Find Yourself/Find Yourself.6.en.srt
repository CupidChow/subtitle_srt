1
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,240
Hi.

2
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,639
Can you please call the girl
who received the bouquet?

3
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:12,280
-Of course.
-Thank you.

4
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,960
Hello, Li Zhenzhen,
someone is looking for you.

5
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,160
Please wait for a moment.

6
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,800
-Are you looking for me?
-Hi.

7
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,880
I saw that you received a bouquet.

8
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,760
The packaging looks posh.

9
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,640
I would like to know where did you get it.

10
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,160
I see.

11
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,520
You've found the right person.

12
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,800
You have great taste.

13
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,600
My boyfriend is a florist.

14
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:45,600
He sent his staff
to deliver flowers to me.

15
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,160
In fact, he sends them here every day.

16
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,440
It seems to be a good advertisement.

17
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,320
My colleagues even went
and made prepaid cards.

18
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,280
Would you like one?

19
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,800
You can get 20 percent off with my name.

20
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,200
He is so nice to you.

21
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59,160
Did you meet him at his store?

22
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,440
Is it love at first sight?

23
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:04,320
No, we met at a speed dating event.

24
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,240
I was accompanying my colleague.

25
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,240
I didn't expect that I'd meet him there.

26
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,120
Maybe it was destiny.

27
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,800
What a coincidence.

28
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,480
I also met mine at the same event.

29
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,440
What a coincidence!

30
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,760
It was two months ago.

31
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,560
He totally stood out among the other guys.

32
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,760
He is neat, polite, and has a nice voice.

33
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:29,120
I fell for him the moment he spoke to me.

34
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:31,960
He has a floral shop

35
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,560
and he smells like flowers.

36
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,720
Yes, it rained after our dinner last night

37
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,280
and he covered me with his jacket.

38
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,720
It felt as if I was in a garden.

39
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,600
So this was the overtime that he told me.

40
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,960
Unfortunately, he is very busy.

41
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,040
He doesn't have much time for me,

42
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,000
but he gave me his supplementary card.

43
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,160
He told me to buy whatever I like.

44
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,120
Look, isn't it pretty?

45
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,320
It is the latest summer edition.

46
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,480
It is pretty.

47
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,480
However, silly girl,

48
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,880
you shouldn't use
your new boyfriend's card.

49
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:07,760
Why is that so?

50
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:11,320
It's because he will judge
your materialistic needs

51
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:14,680
based on your expenses
to see if it is acceptable to him.

52
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:17,920
No, he won't.

53
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,240
He is not like that.

54
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,800
Let's not talk about me.

55
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,560
What about your boyfriend?

56
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:28,760
We broke up.

57
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,800
What? When did it happen?

58
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,320
An hour ago.

59
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:09,960
Hey.

60
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,400
Did you quarrel with the florist?

61
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,000
I don't want to talk right now.

62
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,200
He is cheating with another girl.

63
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,560
No, there might be more than one.

64
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,920
He is seeing multiple girls
as if he is choosing a pet.

65
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,120
After that, he will choose the best.

66
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,440
We could test each other out,
but only when it's one-on-one.

67
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,720
Such a jerk!

68
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,280
He is not your boyfriend yet.

69
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,800
Why don't you let it go?

70
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,320
Let it go?

71
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,760
You aren't in my shoes,
so you feel nothing!

72
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,240
I just want to break his nose right now!

73
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,880
Then just go and break his nose.

74
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,320
But I have no right.

75
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,400
I am not even his girlfriend.

76
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,680
Don't think too much.

77
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,920
Just beat him up.

78
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,680
He lied to you after all.

79
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:03,920
I was wrong.

80
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,640
I shouldn't have told
a stupid geek like you.

81
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,840
You will never get it.

82
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,040
Did you hear it all?

83
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,520
I am sorry,

84
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,840
but I was too close to not overhear.

85
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,320
I thought I was bright enough.

86
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,160
Who knew?

87
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,760
He outwitted me.

88
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,320
Right.

89
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,080
You called me this afternoon, right?

90
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,200
I totally forgot.

91
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,280
What's wrong?

92
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,080
About the blind date...

93
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,560
Forget it.

94
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,640
I'll let you slack off.

95
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,320
You can go home two hours earlier.

96
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,080
Thank you, Ms. He.

97
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,480
No worries.

98
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,880
Am I your pet? You are always bullying me.

99
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:19,120
Do you have time for bowling this weekend?

100
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,560
It has been a while.

101
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,560
I am wasting my membership.

102
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:23,760
No, thank you.

103
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,680
I will be playing a game
with my team this weekend.

104
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,720
Fine, then.

105
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:31,760
I originally planned to treat you
to a seafood buffet after bowling.

106
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,840
Salmon, abalones,

107
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,560
Boston lobster, and a king crab.

108
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,680
Sure.

109
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,720
I will go since you are in a bad mood,

110
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:48,520
not because of the seafood feast.

111
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,680
<i>We're the King and minister.</i>

112
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,720
<i>Qingfeng.</i>

113
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,840
Isn't he the bad guy?

114
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,200
Why is he helping the main character?

115
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,520
The bad guy isn't really helping him.

116
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,080
I can totally tell that he is the bad guy.

117
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,400
Doesn't the main character know?

118
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,040
If he finds out on the 12th episode,

119
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,600
what about the next 58 episodes?

120
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,320
The main character

121
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,560
will see through the bad guy

122
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:21,120
on the 65th episode

123
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,240
and then take revenge
in the next five episodes.

124
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,560
It is plain as day.

125
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,920
What's so difficult?

126
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,039
Canyang must have forgotten his keys here.

127
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,320
I'll get it.

128
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,360
Mrs. Wang.

129
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:45,320
You're home, Fanxing.
What about your parents?

130
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,280
They are watching TV.

131
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,880
Mom, Dad. Mrs. Wang is here.

132
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,360
-Xiulian.
-Hi.

133
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,240
-I'm coming.
-Come here.

134
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,240
Red eggs,

135
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,960
and wedding biscuits.

136
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,960
These are edible,
you may share the happiness.

137
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,120
That's so kind of you.
You even brought it here.

138
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,800
Where...

139
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,120
-Where is the one-month party?
-At Zhou's Seafood Restaurant.

140
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,080
Such a fancy place.

141
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,080
How much is it for a table?

142
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,080
It must be costly.

143
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,120
We did get twins.

144
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,520
It is once-in-a-lifetime good news.

145
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,080
Of course, it has to be grand.

146
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,080
Mrs. Wang, have a cup of tea.

147
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,560
Fanxing, take this.

148
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,480
A token of my regard

149
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,920
to thank both Fanxing and Canyang

150
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,680
for sitting on the wedding bed.

151
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,560
They really brought us the luck of twins.

152
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,480
Now, we have twins.

153
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,760
It is your family's luck.

154
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,640
We have nothing to do with it.

155
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,920
Why not?

156
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,400
If I say you do, then you do.

157
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,240
Take it or it's bad luck.

158
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,520
Just take it.

159
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:49,640
When you were little,
you got tons of her red packets.

160
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,680
That's right, I watched you grow up.

161
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,800
Don't be a stranger.

162
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,040
Keep one for Canyang.

163
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,320
Thank you, Mrs. Wang.

164
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,720
You're welcome.

165
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:04,640
When you get married,
I will give you a big one.

166
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:08,400
By the way, do you have a boyfriend?

167
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,440
No.

168
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,680
You should hurry up.

169
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:18,120
Your family has such good genes.

170
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,680
You are pretty and tall,

171
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,120
so you should pass it on.

172
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,200
I will work hard.

173
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,400
You can't just simply say it.

174
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,040
You have to take action.

175
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,160
Both of your parents are already this old.

176
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,400
Isn't that right?

177
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:31,960
She is still taking her time.

178
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,960
I am worried, do you think she will end up

179
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,040
like Fang Shanshan in the future?

180
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,000
Don't say that.

181
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,360
Fanxing is a decent girl.

182
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,880
We watched her grow up.

183
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,400
We can't compare her to Shanshan.

184
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:53,320
Speaking of which, last year,
Fang Shanshan still kept

185
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,800
in touch with Jiacheng.

186
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,160
Did they?

187
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,160
How did you know?

188
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,120
I saw Jiacheng's phone.

189
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,320
They have each other's WeChat.

190
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,520
What did they talk about?

191
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,720
They asked about

192
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,640
each other's recent condition.

193
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,400
His wife is already pregnant.

194
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,000
Why does she even care?

195
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,880
You can't say that.

196
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,040
They couldn't be a couple,

197
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,920
but they can still be friends, right?

198
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,320
Look after each other.

199
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,440
They are frank and have no hidden agenda.

200
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,360
Am I right?

201
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,680
Old man He, you have no idea.

202
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:29,760
Fang Shanshan is crafty now
that even I myself am scared.

203
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:33,720
Back then, Jiacheng was totally smitten
with her.

204
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,320
It was like the opera

205
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:38,160
when Ning Caichen first met Nie Xiaoqian
on the way to his exam.

206
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,320
He could see no one else, but her.

207
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,160
When his dad and I said no,

208
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,280
he didn't even come home to his parents.

209
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,680
-Is that so?
-But I remember that

210
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,880
it was Fang Shanshan

211
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,400
who dragged Jiacheng home.

212
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,640
Look, we have seen her before.

213
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,680
Her personality,

214
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,720
appearance, and career

215
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,240
-are great.
-That's right.

216
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:01,280
So it is normal for Jiacheng
to fall for her.

217
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,680
But they don't really match
in terms of age.

218
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,160
"Don't really match"?

219
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,000
They are far from being a match.

220
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:12,200
Jiacheng was only 20,
but Fang Shanshan was already 35.

221
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,800
She may look young,

222
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:18,160
but she must have injected hyaluronan
and put on thick makeup.

223
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,600
She is like a mutton dressed as a lamb.

224
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,240
Obviously, she is deceiving young boys!

225
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,840
Several of my neighbors even asked.

226
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:27,640
"Why did Jiacheng find
such an old girlfriend?

227
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:30,920
Does he lack maternal love
because he was brought up by his grandma?"

228
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:31,920
See!

229
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,520
All right.

230
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,160
Jiacheng is a filial son.

231
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,200
Didn't he eventually listen to you?

232
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,720
His dad was hospitalized because of him,

233
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:44,240
only then he came to his senses
and broke up with her.

234
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,600
Look at how great it is right now.

235
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,000
Although they met on a blind date,

236
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,240
they are of the same age.

237
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,480
A perfect match.

238
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,120
Feelings can be nurtured.

239
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,080
Now, they even have twins,

240
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,400
living a good life as a family.

241
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,400
How great.

242
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:03,040
How is Fang Shanshan now?

243
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,760
It seems she hasn't gotten married.

244
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:07,320
She is already 40-year-old.
What kind of man can she meet?

245
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,080
Her parents must be distressed.

246
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:14,760
Sometimes, children should at least
think of their parents.

247
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:15,760
Am I right, Fanxing?

248
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:18,760
Your dad has retired,
it's about time to give him a grandchild.

249
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,400
That's enough.

250
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,320
Thank you,
but please leave me out of this.

251
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:25,680
Now that I have retired,
I want a quiet life for a year or two.

252
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,360
Also, children have their own happiness,

253
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,880
just let them be.

254
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:36,320
If only men were to take charge
of this family, it will be doomed.

255
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,960
You are absolutely indifferent.

256
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:39,920
It is on us,

257
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,880
the grandmothers,

258
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,640
to take care of the grandchildren.

259
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:44,600
Am I right, Hongmei?

260
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,800
I need to take this call.

261
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,080
Go on.

262
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,760
Song Xue, what's the matter?

263
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,080
<i>He Fanxing, come here and help!</i>

264
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,640
<i>A crazy pregnant lady here
wants to get drunk!</i>

265
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,240
What?

266
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,520
Do you know who I was
before I got married?

267
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,800
I was the Hegemon King.

268
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,320
But now?

269
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,800
Two kids in three years.

270
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:16,000
I haven't been drinking for three years!

271
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,720
Tonight, I must live for myself.

272
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,320
I want to drink a beer!

273
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,600
No one can stop me.

274
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,560
Hey!

275
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:29,240
Goodness. Ms. He, you are finally here.

276
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,080
Doesn't she want to drink?

277
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,120
Then just let her.

278
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,800
Has the director changed her style today?

279
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:40,120
She craves for a drink at night
with that baby bump of hers,

280
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:43,120
so she should drink in front of everyone.

281
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,880
She was once the Hegemon King.

282
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,600
Today, she is jumping off the Wu River.

283
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,520
Just let her drink. Here, take this.

284
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,400
All right, I give in.

285
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:56,000
It is just a quarrel among couples.
Why would you take your own life?

286
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,280
Tell us.

287
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:01,000
What caused you to fight
that you want to get drunk?

288
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:05,040
I want to quit my job
and be a stay-at-home mom.

289
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,440
In the past, I thought my mom was a wimp.

290
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,920
She had a heavy burden to bear.

291
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,040
She had to take care of everything,
while suffering quietly.

292
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:14,840
Now I can finally understand.

293
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,240
Once a woman gets married,

294
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,160
she turns into someone's wife,

295
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,960
mother, and daughter-in-law.

296
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,080
However, she lost herself.

297
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,840
I hated it.

298
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,720
But after becoming a mother,

299
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,920
I have lost my right to be willful.

300
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,600
Given that I was the one
who brought my kids to this world,

301
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:37,080
I am responsible to raise them well.

302
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,200
Since you have decided to quit the job

303
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,040
and choose the road you want,

304
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,360
then you should be happy.

305
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,800
But my husband won't let me quit!

306
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:52,200
He said that
his mom will take care of Peanut.

307
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,400
My mom will take care of 100 Yuan.

308
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,760
He would be under a lot of pressure

309
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,640
if he is earning a living alone.

310
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,360
He doesn't want

311
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:03,080
to work two jobs like his colleagues.

312
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:04,640
The kids

313
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,680
will grow up anyway.

314
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,680
Peanut is three years old now.

315
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,680
He still doesn't know
how to change a diaper.

316
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,280
Nothing can stop him

317
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:15,480
from his dance practices
and uploading videos every weekend.

318
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,080
To him,

319
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:20,520
as long as his mom and wife
can take care of the family,

320
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,680
he just has to fulfill
his own responsibility.

321
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,440
I still remember.

322
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,080
When you guys first met,

323
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,400
you told us

324
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,840
that you met an interesting boy.

325
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,280
He played soccer and knew street dancing.

326
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,320
He even nailed every basketball shot
in the arcade.

327
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,640
Also, he knew many
greasy spoons in the alleys.

328
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:45,000
All the DJs in the bars
were his best friends.

329
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,600
Everything was fun when you were with him.

330
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:49,720
It was.

331
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:53,720
In the past, I liked boys
who were fun and playful.

332
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,400
I thought innocence was precious.

333
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,880
But how come he never grows up?

334
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,320
That's why they say
that men marry their wives

335
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,119
to replace their mothers.

336
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,400
To continue coaxing him.

337
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,640
Coax?

338
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,560
How can two of them live by coaxing him?

339
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,119
When will it ever end?

340
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,040
When you have enough of it,

341
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,480
or when you have gotten used to it.

342
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,640
I have gotten used to it!

343
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,680
But we fought today

344
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,960
because I wanted to quit,
so I can take care of the children.

345
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:27,160
Then he said, "You have changed."

346
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,880
You have indeed changed. Cheers.

347
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,040
You have changed.

348
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,000
Forget it, I have changed.

349
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,240
I can no longer be Hegemon King.

350
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,640
HUBBY

351
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,520
What?

352
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,520
I am drinking with my girls.

353
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,120
So what?

354
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,680
You don't care about 100 Yuan anyway.

355
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,280
What? Why can't I call the baby 100 Yuan?

356
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,880
Since we had Peanut,
we haven't traveled for two years.

357
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,640
We only went to Pu'er hot spring.

358
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:30,920
You wouldn't even pay 100 yuan
for the condom in the hotel!

359
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,920
It was because you were stingy!

360
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:35,680
I...

361
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:40,720
I will tell you this!

362
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,160
Oh my goodness.

363
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,000
How is 100 Yuan
supposed to explain its nickname

364
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,160
to his friends in the future?

365
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,680
He will encounter many troubles anyway.

366
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,680
Just take it as his first lesson.

367
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:05,880
He Fanxing.

368
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,480
Why do you look so troubled?

369
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,160
Do you still remember Fang Shanshan?

370
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:18,800
Is she the ex-girlfriend
of your neighbor, Wang Jiacheng?

371
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,600
I thought they broke up two years ago.

372
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:23,880
They did.

373
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,200
He said he only wanted
Fang Shanshan back then.

374
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,160
The entire neighborhood knew about that.

375
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,960
Tonight, his mom came to give red eggs.

376
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,440
His twin daughters

377
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,640
are a month old now.

378
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,520
I met him and his wife the other day.

379
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,800
They seemed happy together.

380
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,480
So,

381
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,760
was Fang Shanshan wrong?

382
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:49,960
Yes.

383
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,240
She was.

384
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,680
So she was wrong

385
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,960
just because she fell for Wang Jiacheng,
who was 15 years younger than her?

386
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,560
There is no right or wrong in love,

387
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,720
but she made a mistake.

388
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:07,520
She was too insistent
on getting other people's approval.

389
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,760
The ordinary people are ordinary
because they represent the majority

390
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:14,360
who can't approve
the lives of the minority.

391
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:18,920
Fang Shanshan was too insistent
on getting his parents' acknowledgment.

392
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,440
She put herself and others in a dilemma.

393
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:23,440
Wang Jiacheng was also stuck in a dilemma.

394
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,240
She made him choose
between her and his parents.

395
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:29,440
It would be wrong no matter who he chose.
What could he do?

396
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,800
I used to think that

397
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,480
love was just about mutual affection.

398
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:40,720
Little did I know,

399
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,360
I underestimated love

400
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:44,920
and life.

401
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,160
Drink up.

402
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,080
Hey.

403
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,320
Which one of you can send me home?

404
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:01,280
So soon?

405
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,440
Don't you want to get drunk?

406
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,040
Hey.

407
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,600
Are you even human?

408
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,120
I am a pregnant woman.

409
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,160
After 100 Yuan grows up,

410
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:13,440
he still has to take care
of you old maids.

411
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:18,880
The next time you fight again,
don't ever come to me.

412
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,040
You are giving me a hard time.

413
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,680
Let's go.

414
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,640
All right.

415
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:36,160
Did you think it was the Olympics?

416
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,560
Why did you keep smashing the ball
and won't let me catch any?

417
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:40,760
Yes, you were amazing.

418
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,680
It was supposed to be an exercise.

419
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:44,720
You should have let me catch it.

420
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:46,000
Let me catch it!

421
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:50,080
I don't get to decide
whether you can catch it.

422
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,840
Whether you can do it or not,
it depends on you.

423
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:55,360
All right, enough with the tongue twister.

424
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,400
You asked me to play badminton with you.

425
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,080
Well, not tomorrow.

426
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,840
I will continue with my sword practice.

427
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:04,120
Come on, why are you so fired up?

428
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,040
Winning and losing are part of the game.

429
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,120
Your skill was...

430
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:10,400
-What's wrong with that?
-Dad, Mom.

431
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,320
I am going out.

432
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:13,480
Do you have a date?

433
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:15,480
A blind date.

434
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,040
Be safe.

435
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,160
Come back earlier.

436
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:19,800
Don't you want to win?

437
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,240
I will find you an opponent.

438
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:24,280
Our neighbor, Old Zhang.

439
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,240
That paralyzed Zhang.

440
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,520
You will win for sure.

441
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:27,920
Fine. I was wrong, okay?

442
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:30,240
I apologize for my big mouth.

443
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,400
I am sorry, I was wrong.

444
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,040
Look at that attitude.

445
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,800
"Fine, I was wrong."

446
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,040
Are you annoyed?

447
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:40,720
What about it?
What else do you want me to say?

448
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,800
You just won't let it go!

449
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,200
Am I the problem now? It was your fault!

450
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,640
It was just a game!

451
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,680
-But you can't keep smashing!
-I didn't even bow to you yet.

452
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:52,240
Look at you. What do you want?

453
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,480
Our girl

454
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,240
doesn't even like those guys,

455
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,520
but she keeps going on blind dates.

456
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:06,920
She is hoping to find a gem
from the blind dates.

457
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,040
She is dreaming.

458
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:20,600
At the center.

459
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:22,280
At the center.

460
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:27,840
Mr. Ye, what a coincidence.

461
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:36,400
Is it you?

462
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:42,240
Due to our previous unpleasant encounter,

463
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:43,960
let's start over again.

464
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,520
Hi, I'm Ye Luming.

465
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,400
Pleased to meet you.

466
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,560
Pleased to meet you too.

467
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:58,920
How pleased are you?

468
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,000
Not really.

469
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:02,800
It's just a courtesy.

470
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:03,880
Aren't you the same?

471
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,440
Of course not.

472
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,760
Or else, I wouldn't be here.

473
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:12,880
Please take a seat.

474
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,360
I am the total opposite.

475
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,360
If I knew it was you,
I wouldn't have come.

476
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,280
So now you envy those

477
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,640
who have two phones.

478
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,400
When I knew it was you,

479
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:34,160
I thought it must be fate.

480
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,520
We are meant to meet each other.

481
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:39,040
Only if you consider ill fate as fate.

482
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,840
Are you still angry about
what happened previously?

483
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:42,760
No.

484
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,480
That was a misunderstanding.

485
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:48,240
I have always thought
that you are quite nice.

486
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:51,680
You lent me a dress
and didn't terminate the contract.

487
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,400
You did me a big favor.

488
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,640
It was you who had done me a big favor.

489
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,440
Love Charm is like my foster son.

490
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,320
You have reunited a family.

491
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,960
It was such a great deed.

492
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,520
I can only repay you with myself.

493
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,720
No, that is not necessary.

494
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,080
Just buy me a cup of coffee.

495
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,640
That won't be enough.

496
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:13,720
I will buy you a meal.

497
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,640
Do you like Western or Chinese cuisine?

498
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,400
French cuisine?

499
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,520
Or Japanese cuisine?

500
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,200
Chinese cuisine.

501
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,520
I happen to know a great restaurant.

502
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,720
Just by the lake and it has a great view.

503
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:27,200
Mr. Ye.

504
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:32,120
Actually, I didn't come here
for a blind date.

505
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,960
It is only because I have promised

506
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,920
and didn't want to bother her.

507
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:39,760
So I came here to apologize to you.

508
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:44,320
Why are you going back on your words?

509
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:50,000
It is because there's someone I like.

510
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,160
All of a sudden?

511
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,000
Not really.

512
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,480
It's just that
I never really thought about it.

513
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,920
Are you together now?

514
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,960
I am still thinking about it.

515
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:09,000
So it means...

516
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,120
that you like him

517
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,080
and he is currently pursuing you,

518
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,680
but you have yet to say yes.

519
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,360
Yes.

520
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,480
Let me get you coffee!

521
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,600
What would you like?

522
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,120
Espresso?

523
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,520
Latte?

524
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,720
Or macchiato?

525
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:29,320
-Con Panna espresso?
-Iced Americano!

526
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,800
Didn't I say that it is fate?

527
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,280
I will be right back.

528
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:58,360
<i>-Hello.</i>
-Steven, you jinxed me.

529
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,120
You said I would be intercepted.

530
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,640
It is really happening now.

531
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,680
Did you send the competitor?

532
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:07,480
<i>How unlucky.</i>

533
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:08,920
<i>Then, there's no choice.</i>

534
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,560
<i>Just be friends.</i>

535
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:14,640
Befriending the person I like
is a self-torture.

536
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,760
<i>Win her over then.</i>

537
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:18,320
Yes.

538
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:21,280
At this point,
I can only change my strategy.

539
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:24,960
I will find out the client's needs
and look into the competitor.

540
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:27,240
After that, slowly figure out a plan.

541
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:28,760
<i>Are you for real?</i>

542
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:30,680
<i>Gentlemen don't steal girls.</i>

543
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,160
You know nothing.

544
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:36,320
First love always ends up in a breakup.

545
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:38,320
I swear I won't be an intruder.

546
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,320
But I am still in the game.

547
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:42,520
Just like a match.

548
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:43,720
When someone is playing,

549
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,360
I will sit on the bench temporarily

550
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:47,080
and wait for a chance to play.

551
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,320
<i>Sure.</i>

552
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:51,120
<i>If you manage to play within two months,</i>

553
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,960
<i>I'll raise your advertisement fees
by ten percent.</i>

554
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,080
<i> How about that?</i>

555
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:57,880
Get your contract ready!

556
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:08,880
Your iced Americano.

557
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:12,240
Here's the dessert, I hope you'll like it.

558
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:13,880
Thank you.

559
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:22,640
Actually, I came here
because my sister forced me.

560
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,080
My parents died young.

561
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:26,760
My sister brought me up.

562
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,280
Sisters are like mothers.

563
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,320
I am already 37,
but I don't have a partner.

564
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,400
She feels sorry that
she can't answer to our parents

565
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,760
at the Qingming Festival.

566
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,760
But...

567
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,680
I am happy with my life now.

568
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,200
Besides,

569
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:44,560
there is someone I like.

570
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,600
So you have someone you like.

571
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,080
Why didn't you take her to your sister?

572
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:54,680
I like her,

573
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,040
but she doesn't like me.

574
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,200
I am sorry.

575
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:02,880
It's okay.

576
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:06,520
It's better to have someone you like
than none.

577
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,040
Yes.

578
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,560
It doesn't have to be mutual.

579
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,240
When you like a flower,
you don't have to pick it.

580
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:20,120
Since you like him and he's pursuing you,

581
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,480
why are you still hesitating?

582
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,000
To be honest,

583
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,840
I have always wanted
to talk to someone about this.

584
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,720
But I never thought that it would be you.

585
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:50,360
You have always wanted to talk to someone,

586
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:53,840
but you have never done that because...

587
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:00,040
you don't want your close friends to know.

588
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:06,120
It's hard to bring it up.

589
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,040
You are right.

590
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:19,720
A relationship that is hard to bring up

591
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:21,600
is usually

592
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,600
related to these situations.

593
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:26,480
A married man?

594
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,560
Best friend's boyfriend?

595
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,200
Age difference?

596
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:41,440
Age difference it is.

597
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,120
You are wrong.

598
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:48,520
I am guessing the age difference is eight,

599
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:49,840
nine,

600
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:52,120
ten, eleven...

601
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,680
Ten years.

602
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:58,880
A fresh graduate?

603
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:01,960
That is indeed troubling.

604
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,400
I don't mind telling you this.

605
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,080
Usually,

606
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:14,440
when a man has a girlfriend
who is ten years younger,

607
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:17,360
everyone will accuse the woman.

608
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,120
When a woman gets a younger man,

609
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:22,600
most people will also accuse the woman.

610
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:25,720
They tend to say,
"You are not suited together."

611
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,080
"People will judge."

612
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:29,880
"Office romance is unstable" and so on.

613
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,440
So he is also your colleague.

614
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,280
You are right.

615
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:38,520
Those are the opinions of the majority.

616
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,600
The minority will also tell you

617
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,040
to be yourself.

618
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:43,800
Or, "Don't care about others."

619
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,280
Or something like,

620
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:46,920
"Don't care about eternity

621
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,840
as long as you once owned it."

622
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:53,480
So are you the majority or the minority?

623
00:32:57,280 --> 00:33:00,040
Only those without a solution
will choose a side.

624
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:08,200
There is a solution
that offers the best of both worlds.

625
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,920
<i>Don't go to the blind date, or else...</i>

626
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:17,040
I will give you three seconds to reply.

627
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,280
HE FANXING

628
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:21,280
Three.

629
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:24,440
Two.

630
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:27,720
One.

631
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,240
Fine, another three seconds.

632
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:33,600
Three.

633
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,600
Two.

634
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,680
One.

635
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,200
That was a mistake.

636
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:56,840
Yes.

637
00:33:57,080 --> 00:34:00,200
Too bad those pins
are too far away from you.

638
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:13,960
I give up.

639
00:34:14,199 --> 00:34:16,239
You always win, it's not fun at all.

640
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:18,920
Do you always give up
when you encounter troubles?

641
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:21,480
I know when to proceed
and when to give up.

642
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:26,679
A guy like you

643
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:28,679
will never get a girlfriend.

644
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,440
Why do I need a girlfriend?

645
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:31,760
I feel great on my own.

646
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,480
I only have a mouth to feed.

647
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:36,679
I can tell how costly a wedding would be
if it was for you.

648
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:39,880
A guy like you doesn't even have a goal.

649
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:43,960
Your existence only wastes resources
and creates rubbish.

650
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:45,440
You are right.

651
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:48,239
Your material pursuits sound exceptional.

652
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:50,440
Now I know why you were beaten.

653
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:51,960
It is because of how mean you are.

654
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,520
You deserve to be beaten.

655
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,560
Yes, I deserve it.

656
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,120
I brought it upon myself.

657
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:01,160
I really don't know what to say.

658
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:04,160
You are 27, 28 years old now.
Can't you be more reliable?

659
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:06,200
Couldn't you solve the problem properly?

660
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,480
Was fighting necessary?

661
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:09,160
Are you a gangster?

662
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:10,720
That was really low.

663
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:22,080
Let's stop playing.

664
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:24,120
I'm hungry, so let's eat something.

665
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,200
Sure.

666
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:29,520
We should go early
for the seat near the food counter.

667
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:31,520
-Right.
-Let's go.

668
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:33,880
Let's go.

669
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,360
Where are you?

670
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:38,840
We are already at the mall.

671
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,160
I am coming. Right behind you.

672
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:44,200
Where is Chang Huan?

673
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:46,120
In the washroom, let's wait here.

674
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,280
Sure.

675
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:49,920
Anyway, Ms. He went on a blind date today.

676
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:51,440
I wonder how it went.

677
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:53,920
What kind of hot mess is it this time?

678
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,480
"Hot mess"?

679
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:56,920
I have set her up twice.

680
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,240
Both of them are a catch.

681
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:02,280
My senior planned to introduce
this man to me,

682
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:06,160
but I was seeing that jerk florist,
so I introduced Ms. He to him.

683
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,240
I should have gone instead.

684
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,080
They are just nearby.

685
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:13,200
Let me ask her.

686
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:16,800
If he is really a catch,
you will definitely regret it.

687
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,160
No way.

688
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:23,520
Ms. He.

689
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:25,400
Is everything all right?

690
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,000
<i>-How should I put this?
-Hey.</i>

691
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:31,880
<i>They have vanilla, strawberry,
and chocolate ice-creams.</i>

692
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:33,240
<i>What do you want?</i>

693
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:34,440
<i>Vanilla.</i>

694
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:37,200
Seems like it is going very well.

695
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:40,440
Eating ice-cream is
a great chance to kindle love.

696
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:41,840
You should seize the chance.

697
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:44,160
<i>I can't explain it for now.</i>

698
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,720
<i>I will tell you later.</i>

699
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:47,280
Don't be embarrassed.

700
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:48,280
Go for it!

701
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:50,640
Hey!

702
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,840
-Ms. He is down there.
-What?

703
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:53,960
Where?

704
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:11,240
Not bad.

705
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,120
He is very handsome.

706
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:15,800
They look good together.

707
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:31,280
The train to Wenzhou is leaving.

708
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:33,040
-Where to?
-Nantong.

709
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:35,200
-The train to Nantong is leaving.
-Where to?

710
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:37,480
-Nanjing.
-The train to Nanjing is leaving.

711
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:38,920
-Where to?
-Beijing.

712
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,080
-The train to Beijing is leaving.
-Where to?

713
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:42,000
Hong Kong.

714
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,520
-Drink up!
-Drink up!

715
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:49,960
Let's continue.

716
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,240
The train to Hong Kong is leaving.

717
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:55,640
-Where to?
-To Hohhot.

718
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:58,320
Where on earth is Hohhot?

719
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,800
You are so mean for saying this name.

720
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,280
Then I will say...

721
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:03,720
Buenos Aires!

722
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,520
No, no foreign countries.

723
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:06,920
You are shameless.

724
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:09,760
He is not feeling himself today,
so I shall drink for him.

725
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,160
Hey, enough.

726
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,240
Go on!

727
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:19,520
-The train to Beijing is leaving.
-Where to?

728
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:20,520
Nantong.

729
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,040
The train to Nantong is leaving.

730
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:23,800
-Where to?
-Guangzhou.

731
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,400
The train to Guangzhou is leaving.

732
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:26,320
Where to?

733
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:29,360
-Drink up!
-Drink up.

734
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,560
What's in the zoo?

735
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:34,480
Rhino.

736
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,680
Drink up! You lose!

737
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:38,600
-Hurry.
-Exactly.

738
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:40,120
-She doesn't know how to play.
-Exactly.

739
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:43,120
-Are you my friends? Let's continue.
-It's my turn.

740
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,960
DON'T GO TO THE BLIND DATE, OR ELSE...

741
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:52,000
You don't seem like yourself today.

742
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,000
What is wrong?

743
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:55,480
I am waiting for my boss's reply.

744
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,160
Your boss is amazing.

745
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:59,720
She managed to tame a wild dog like you.

746
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:01,920
She is amazing.

747
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:03,760
There is nothing I can do.

748
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:05,600
This is the working life.

749
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:09,280
Yuan Song, a friendly reminder for you.

750
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:11,840
There is a special event for you tonight.

751
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:13,400
A prank?

752
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:16,560
Who would have the guts to prank you?

753
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:19,360
Melon wants to confess to you.

754
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,000
All men would know this.

755
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:25,960
A public confession puts pressure
on the recipient by using the crowd.

756
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,240
All of us have done it before.

757
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:31,320
I have never done it.

758
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:33,520
I have always been the one
who was pressured.

759
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:36,480
It is good to be handsome.

760
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:39,920
To be honest,
I don't like to be confessed to.

761
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:44,040
It would be hurtful regardless
how I reject or sugarcoat it.

762
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:46,400
Even if I don't like her,

763
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:47,400
I don't wish

764
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,520
to hurt the person who likes me.

765
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,280
You are indeed our senior.

766
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:53,680
How mature.

767
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,360
What about Melon?

768
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,800
You haven't dated for a year.

769
00:39:58,120 --> 00:39:59,840
You are so nice towards her in the club

770
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:01,600
and even team up with her.

771
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:03,480
You must have developed some feelings.

772
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:05,440
This might sound mean.

773
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:08,920
But she keeps chattering,
just like a little bird.

774
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:10,800
She is like my little sister.

775
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:15,680
This answer will be the top ten answers
that girls hate.

776
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,600
Big Head, Yuan Song! Come here!

777
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:20,400
-She is going to blow the candles.
-Coming!

778
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:22,720
Let's go.

779
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:33,040
-Make a wish!
-Make a wish!

780
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:35,480
-Make a wish!
-Make a wish!

781
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:37,200
-Make a wish!
-Make a wish!

782
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:42,160
It is windy, so just let it be.
Imagine that you've blown out the candles.

783
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:53,600
I only have one wish this year.

784
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:56,160
I want my wish to come true tonight.

785
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:01,320
Melon.

786
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:03,240
What the heck was that?

787
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:04,960
I am threatening it with my mind.

788
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:06,960
-Are you nuts?
-Crazy.

789
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:16,960
Before cutting the cake,

790
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:20,000
I have something to say to Yuan Song.

791
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:28,960
Yuan Song.

792
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:31,760
I think that I am very lucky.

793
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:38,320
When I passed by the Ballroom Dance Club's
recruitment booth,

794
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:42,000
I saw you reading alone on the bench.

795
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,040
<i>For a long period of time,</i>

796
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:46,120
<i>I envied those who can draw.</i>

797
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,600
<i>I regret that I didn't take drawing class</i>

798
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:51,400
<i>when I was in third grade.</i>

799
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,680
<i>So I couldn't draw you.</i>

800
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:58,000
<i>I really like you.</i>

801
00:41:58,480 --> 00:41:59,800
<i>Whether you are dancing,</i>

802
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:02,240
<i>sleeping,</i>

803
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,000
<i>or smiling,</i>

804
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:06,680
<i>I like all of them.</i>

805
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:10,480
I wish to see your smile
for many birthdays to come.

806
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,920
I wish to protect your smile.

807
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:18,640
For that, I will work hard
to be a better person.

808
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,640
Someone who deserves you.

809
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:24,200
So,

810
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:27,920
will you give me a chance

811
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:31,840
to be your girlfriend?

812
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:41,720
-Say yes!
-Say yes!

813
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:44,280
-Say yes!
-Say yes!

814
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:46,760
-Say yes!
-Say yes!

815
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,720
You don't have to give me
your answer right now.

816
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:58,960
I'll give you the answer now.

817
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:01,240
