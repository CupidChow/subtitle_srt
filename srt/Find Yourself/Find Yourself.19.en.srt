1
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,800
Your mom gave you
200,000 yuan for renovation.

2
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,440
Buy it if you have the money.

3
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,880
It was enough initially.

4
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:13,400
But it's not enough
to buy this showerhead.

5
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,760
So you're here today...

6
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:21,440
There's a 50 percent discount
for this now.

7
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,520
It's a really good deal.

8
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,160
How much is it?

9
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,320
Not much.

10
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,800
Just 45,000 yuan.

11
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:30,840
Get lost!

12
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:39,760
Fine.

13
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,480
I'll figure it out myself.

14
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,680
What can you come up with?

15
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,680
Are you planning to sell your bags
and jewelry to make some cash?

16
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,080
I don't care.

17
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,880
I want this showerhead.

18
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,960
You're so happy lately.
You're doing well in both career and love.

19
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:00,040
Can't you get me the showerhead?

20
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,240
Doing well in love and career?

21
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,280
Don't think that I don't know.

22
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,960
My mom has sent me the photos.

23
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,240
You have finally gotten the girl you like.

24
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:12,680
While here I am,
not even worthy of being a backup.

25
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,440
I have neither love nor the showerhead.

26
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,600
But I want the showerhead!

27
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,440
I want it!

28
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,760
I can't buy the person I like with money.

29
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:31,320
If I can't even buy the things I like,
I will definitely die!

30
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,080
Hey, stop whining.

31
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,520
Can't you talk properly?

32
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,160
You are such a cheapskate
and so stingy with your money.

33
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:40,400
I will never give my blessing
to you and that girl!

34
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,400
I'm counting to three.

35
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,040
Stop whining or I won't buy it.

36
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,720
One!

37
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,680
Then does this mean
it's over between you two?

38
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,840
Who said so?

39
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:02,360
I haven't given up.
I'm still working on it.

40
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:08,520
In this world, not everything pans out
just because you work hard.

41
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,720
You're in the prime of youth,
so you should love more daringly.

42
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,760
Or you'll regret it when you reach my age.

43
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,839
I don't get what you see
in that brat anyway.

44
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,040
He is only slightly taller

45
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,400
and smooth at talking
just because he has the looks.

46
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,480
How did his parents raise him?

47
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:30,440
He does nothing but fool around every day.

48
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,480
You're wrong!

49
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,040
He is not like what you think.
He is very capable.

50
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,520
Whatever, I can't stand the sight of him.

51
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,200
Uncle.

52
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,880
Why are you acting so weird?

53
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,240
Do you know him?

54
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,960
I don't know him, I've never met him,

55
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,320
and I'm not interested.

56
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,400
Why does it feel like
you have a personal grudge towards him?

57
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,920
Is it only my imagination?

58
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,920
That's because...

59
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,200
he doesn't like you, Minmin.

60
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,560
He must be blind.

61
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,960
That's true.

62
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,320
So are you going to buy
the showerhead for me?

63
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,800
If you don't,

64
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,960
I guess I'll have to sell my bags
at the night market.

65
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,640
Say something nice.

66
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,440
What?

67
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:34,240
You said you wouldn't give your blessing
to me and that girl.

68
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,920
Who were you referring to
when you said "that girl"?

69
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,360
Think properly before you answer.

70
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,640
Aunt?

71
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,200
Louder, I can't hear you.

72
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,960
Aunt!

73
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56,800
If I could hear
a few congratulatory words right now,

74
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,800
I would immediately transfer the money.

75
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,080
My dear Uncle,

76
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:07,120
you and Aunt are a match made in heaven.

77
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:10,680
I hereby pray that
you will have beautiful babies soon,

78
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,680
grow old together
and have everlasting happiness.

79
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,480
All right.

80
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:18,840
Go sell your bags.

81
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,200
How could you trick me?

82
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,720
A child who does not know
of the harshness of reality

83
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,840
won't see anything beyond the obvious.

84
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,440
Hey.

85
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,720
Take out the trash.

86
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,200
<i>Mr. Ye.</i>

87
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,440
<i>Are you up for pool tonight?</i>

88
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,680
<i>It's on. Tonight at 8:30 p.m.</i>

89
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,840
RESIGNATION LETTER

90
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,320
FROM YUAN SONG

91
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:41,920
<i>When you love someone,</i>

92
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,920
<i>you can always pick him out</i>

93
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,840
<i>from a sea of people.</i>

94
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,400
<i>It's because he shines brightly.</i>

95
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,120
Greetings, teachers.

96
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,760
I'm Yuan Song, a senior
majoring in environmental art.

97
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,680
My thesis is on the performance
and application of gray space.

98
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,640
Gray space was introduced

99
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,000
by the Japanese architect, Kisho Kurokawa.

100
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,520
The gray in a gray space
originates from Japan.

101
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,120
<i>The source of his light</i>

102
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,840
<i>is probably from his youthful confidence,</i>

103
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,000
<i>his dauntlessness,</i>

104
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,600
<i>and naivety
that has not been polluted by time.</i>

105
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,480
<i>He is a flower in full bloom.</i>

106
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,280
<i>The sun at 10:00 a.m.</i>

107
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,880
<i>A young man
who is about to take on the world.</i>

108
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,560
<i>As for me,</i>

109
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:30,120
<i>I am the train
going in the opposite direction.</i>

110
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:34,360
<i>We meet on the platform
for a brief five minutes.</i>

111
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:37,320
<i>We have a great chat.</i>

112
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,120
<i>Give this to Yuan Song tomorrow.</i>

113
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,480
He must be waiting for it.

114
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:44,640
Okay.

115
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,840
-Be careful while taking the cab.
-Okay.

116
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,120
I almost forgot.

117
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,360
He will be off tomorrow
for his thesis' oral defense.

118
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,720
Give it to him yourself.

119
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,760
Your memory is as bad as Dad's.

120
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,640
<i>In the brief and fleeting five minutes,</i>

121
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:37,080
<i>we just want to talk about happy things.</i>

122
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,880
<i>Not the past,</i>

123
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,440
<i>nor the future.</i>

124
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,280
<i>It's because</i>

125
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,440
<i>there isn't enough time
to talk about the past.</i>

126
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:46,840
<i>As for the future,</i>

127
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,920
<i>we don't even know</i>

128
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,680
<i>where the train will take us.</i>

129
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,000
Thank you, Mr. He.

130
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:02,960
How nice.

131
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,200
To see the world while you're still young.

132
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,720
I should have studied abroad too.

133
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,840
I heard American ladies
are very welcoming.

134
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,800
Which school will you apply to?

135
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,560
We'll see as I still have many exams.

136
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,240
I helped with the recommendation letter,
so dinner is on you, right?

137
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,320
Maybe next time. I have a date tonight.

138
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,960
I have to oversee the wiring
and plumbing at the site.

139
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,200
-I have to go.
-Okay.

140
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,080
Don't forget, you owe me a meal.

141
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,520
I know, I won't.

142
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,080
-See you.
-Until next time.

143
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,240
Bye.

144
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:38,720
Gosh.

145
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,480
You're pretty good.

146
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,720
Have you practiced before?

147
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:44,520
I'm in sales, so I have to know
a little bit of everything.

148
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,000
This position...

149
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,760
This position...

150
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,080
I shouldn't take advantage.

151
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,400
Mr. Ye, you're amazing at pool!

152
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,400
I'm totally at a loss for words.

153
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,760
Everyone is good at something.

154
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,160
I'm actually just so-so at pool.

155
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,600
Yes, just so-so.

156
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,920
Cong Xiao, listen.

157
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,200
You two are at a similar level.

158
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,760
You're good at looking for angles,

159
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,280
but when you hit the cue,
you tend to rush and lose control.

160
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,360
Just slow down.

161
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,440
He Fanxing.

162
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,600
Do you know how to play pool too?

163
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,800
A little, but I'm not that good at it.

164
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:22,760
How about a game?

165
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,000
No, thank you.

166
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,160
I don't like it
because it made me vomit before.

167
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:29,880
I understand.

168
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,560
You've said so many things.

169
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,640
If you performed poorly,

170
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,040
then you would

171
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,440
fall flat on your face into the trash can.

172
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,840
When it comes to pool,

173
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,160
my expertise

174
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,640
is to make my opponent's face
fall flat into the trash can.

175
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,280
Cong Xiao.

176
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,280
Excuse me.

177
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,720
Let's make it clear first.

178
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,640
What do I get if I win?

179
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:14,880
If you win?

180
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:18,000
Sure. What do you want?

181
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,920
If you win, I can even sell myself to you.

182
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,920
If I win, you'll have to buy me ice cream.

183
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:33,280
Since I'm getting the bigger perk,
you can start first.

184
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,280
Okay, I'll hit the first break.

185
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,320
Don't be a sore loser.

186
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,240
How are you also so good at pool?

187
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,520
Actually, it's because of my brother.

188
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,720
I've been so exhausted lately.

189
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,320
We're taking over a company,
so I was working overtime.

190
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:17,600
How about you?

191
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,400
I'm leaving my internship.

192
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,280
Were you on an internship?

193
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,920
I thought you were busy
with the TOEFL exam.

194
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:30,120
I went on an internship

195
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,480
because I needed half a year
to prepare to go abroad.

196
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:33,960
I didn't want to be idle.

197
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,400
But now,

198
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,080
I'm not sure if I want to study abroad.

199
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,920
You're not sure?
Isn't that what you always wanted to do?

200
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,040
Are you reluctant
to leave your girlfriend?

201
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,360
Does she not want
a long-distance relationship?

202
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,280
No, I haven't told her yet.

203
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:00,560
Then are you afraid that she might say no?

204
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:04,200
No. I'm sure she'll support me
and let me go.

205
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,360
If she supports you
and you have no worries,

206
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,000
why are you still unsure?

207
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,880
We have been together
for barely three months.

208
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,040
We're keeping it a secret,
so the relationship isn't that stable.

209
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:20,120
She will let me go
because she's the more mature one.

210
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,560
She will never say no if it's good for me.

211
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,640
But studying abroad...

212
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,560
Two years is too long.

213
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,800
Is that all the confidence
you have in her?

214
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:35,320
Do you have to choose
between her and going abroad?

215
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,280
She's the one who doesn't trust me.

216
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:38,880
She likes me,

217
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:41,960
but I believe she can still go on
without me.

218
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:45,680
What do you think?

219
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:48,040
One can still live without the other.

220
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,520
I know that.

221
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:50,920
The problem is

222
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,920
she's being too rational
in this relationship.

223
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,280
I hope she won't be able to live
without me.

224
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:59,320
Even if I go abroad,
she would wait for me and stay loyal.

225
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,120
But...

226
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,560
I can't bring myself to tell her that.

227
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,160
Yuan Song.

228
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,960
Teenage girls

229
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,240
are ruled by emotions
when it comes to love.

230
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:19,040
Like a blaze, leaving only ash behind.

231
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:23,320
As for a woman in her 30s
who still believes in love, she is...

232
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:27,000
Half of it is emotion, which is fire,
and the other is reason, which is water.

233
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,360
The water controls the blaze,
so it won't flame out.

234
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:33,000
While the fire controls the water,
so that it won't become too cold.

235
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:37,200
Isn't that the kind of person you like?

236
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,560
That is why I am unsure.

237
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:44,040
If I go abroad,
the water might put out the fire.

238
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,360
Or perhaps,

239
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,640
someone better than me might appear.

240
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,480
It might be the end for us.

241
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,120
You really like her, don't you?

242
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,400
At first, I found her amusing.

243
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,839
She was so rigid
that I wanted to tease and annoy her.

244
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:10,000
Later on, I started
to pay more attention to her.

245
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,599
The more I got to know her,
the more I realized

246
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,760
how utterly cute she was.

247
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,960
When everything a girl does
is cute in your eyes,

248
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,520
that's the highest level of love.

249
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:27,720
Think carefully about what to do next.

250
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,160
You're still young.

251
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,880
You can afford to make mistakes.

252
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,360
I'm with you.

253
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,040
Now enough brooding and eat up.
The food is getting cold.

254
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,080
I spent the entire summer break

255
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:51,240
learning how to play pool
at my friend's aunt's sports club.

256
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:54,520
If my dad had not given me
ten yuan as daily allowance,

257
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,920
I would have given up.

258
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,680
I was stuck there for eight hours a day.

259
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,560
Aside from practice,

260
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,080
I also had to do chores
in exchange for tuition.

261
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,880
Mr. He is incredible.

262
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:11,800
Hey.

263
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,400
It was me.

264
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:18,160
I was the one who stopped my brother
from being rebellious.

265
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,320
Why are you praising my dad?

266
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,480
A daily allowance of ten yuan?

267
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,840
That means Mr. He spent
less than 1,000 yuan that summer.

268
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:29,560
First, he made his daughter learn
how to play pool.

269
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:33,640
Then he made sure his son didn't end up
as a useless person in society.

270
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:37,400
Do you not agree that
he killed two birds with one stone?

271
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,160
You're right.

272
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,800
My dad is so smart.

273
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:42,840
He's incredible.

274
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:46,720
He's so smart.

275
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,000
What a genius.

276
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,320
Your dad is incredible,

277
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:52,160
but you shouldn't get ice cream
all over your mouth.

278
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,000
What are you doing?

279
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,480
My foundation is expensive!

280
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:59,120
I wanted to wipe your mouth,
not your foundation.

281
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,200
There's still some on you.

282
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,800
What if you wiped it off?

283
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:08,800
I don't know.

284
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:15,440
Ye looks okay on the outside,
but his temper is a problem.

285
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,520
Tonight, Cong Xiao didn't seem

286
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,240
<i>too engrossed.</i>

287
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,720
<i>She probably lost interest in him.</i>

288
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:26,760
You did all you could.
The rest is up to them.

289
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:28,720
Anyway,

290
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,160
what about you?

291
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,120
Did your oral defense go well?

292
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:33,920
<i>Yes, it went pretty good.</i>

293
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,840
Right, I'll be taking
my graduation photos tomorrow.

294
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:37,840
Can you come?

295
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,600
Does that have anything to do with me?

296
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,800
Also, tomorrow is not Sunday.

297
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:44,840
I will be busy.

298
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,120
Don't you want to see me
in my graduation gown?

299
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,000
No.

300
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,560
It's so nice to be young.

301
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:04,200
Our graduation was ten years ago.

302
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,640
Time sure flies.

303
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:08,680
Right.

304
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,000
It has been ten years.

305
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,720
We were just like them
when we were in college.

306
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,160
We were so boisterous in public places.

307
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,560
We weren't as bad.

308
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,960
The two of us were quieter,
unlike Yang Xiaoyu.

309
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,800
We complemented one another.

310
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:28,760
She was as loud as two people.

311
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,320
Indeed.

312
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,560
Hey, Fanxing.

313
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:42,080
If there was a time machine
that could take us back to ten years ago,

314
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,560
would you use it?

315
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:46,760
No. Spare me, please.

316
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:50,000
I'm finally living a good life now.

317
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,320
Who would want to go back?

318
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:53,840
Me neither.

319
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:57,640
Teenage girls are wary
of becoming 30-year-old women.

320
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,800
But after living through it,

321
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:02,600
having to fix all the holes
and patch them up,

322
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,560
I am now an upgraded
and better version of myself.

323
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,480
There's no way I'm going back.

324
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,040
Right.

325
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,760
The thing about time

326
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,360
is that all your experiences

327
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,520
will definitely leave behind traces.

328
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,680
You can't hide it.

329
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,280
You must be kidding.

330
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,240
Someone like you
who has not experienced any heartbreaks

331
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,320
is still considered a teenager at heart.

332
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:27,600
Even Yuan Song
has more experience than you.

333
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,320
What do you mean by traces?

334
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:35,240
Even if my heart
is still a naive young teenager,

335
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:38,320
my soul is already that of an old man.

336
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:43,200
I know that I'm a newbie
when it comes to love.

337
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,800
But when it comes
to other aspects of life,

338
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:49,040
from the 20s to 30s,

339
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:52,960
from physical to emotional,
I have undergone monumental changes.

340
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:58,040
It feels like I have walked a long path.

341
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,280
I tripped,

342
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:01,680
I was drenched in rain,

343
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,200
and I stepped in mud.

344
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,760
Many dreams were shot down by reality.

345
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,080
I have learned

346
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:14,240
that a normal person
who wants to maintain a normal life

347
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,720
is harder than it looks.

348
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:19,760
Look at them.

349
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:23,040
They have nothing but youth.

350
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:27,280
They know nothing
about the evil power of time.

351
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:31,800
Blissful, happy, dauntless.

352
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:33,600
After ten years,

353
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,080
they will become who we are now.

354
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:38,680
We will always be one step ahead.

355
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:45,160
Shouldn't you be intoxicated by love
and be reveling in affection right now?

356
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,600
Why do you suddenly sound so old?

357
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:54,280
It turns out that a normal person

358
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,640
can't survive with only love.

359
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:01,280
I turned 31 this year.

360
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:04,120
Everyone is worried
that I won't get married.

361
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:07,120
My options in life

362
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:10,680
consist of being single, the hard mode,

363
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,080
marriage, the endless mode,

364
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:15,520
and dating, the internal test mode.

365
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:19,040
None of them is easy.

366
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:20,800
True.

367
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,720
Why isn't there an option for easy mode?

368
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:31,040
Still, it's my first time hearing
that dating is an internal test mode.

369
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:32,840
But it's very figurative.

370
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,400
It's okay.

371
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,040
This internal test is ending soon anyway.

372
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,800
Why does it sound like

373
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,160
your first love is about to end?

374
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:50,760
Congratulations.

375
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:54,120
Your prediction might come true.

376
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,760
He's going to study abroad.

377
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,040
Study abroad?

378
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:02,760
Yes.

379
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:06,360
Also, he didn't tell me.

380
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,360
I saw the recommendation letter
from Canyang.

381
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,560
He Fanxing.

382
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,520
Don't tell me
you have been played by a boy?

383
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:19,880
No way.

384
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,120
He's not the type to do so.

385
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,560
He probably...

386
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:28,560
just doesn't know how to break it to me.

387
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,200
Studying abroad is good.

388
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,480
But it's a big world out there.

389
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:41,840
He will meet new people
and live in a new environment.

390
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,400
Our feelings might slowly fade.

391
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:48,400
Yes.

392
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,880
It's going to be
a long-distance relationship.

393
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:53,200
Can a young man like him

394
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,120
stand the loneliness?

395
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,240
That's right.

396
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:03,120
Nobody knows what the future holds.

397
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:07,440
We can only cherish
the blissful moments now.

398
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,280
I never expected it to last anyway.

399
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:15,880
Don't all first love end?

400
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,160
There's no need to act tough.

401
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:22,320
If you die from a heartbreak one day,
remember to give us a call.

402
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:24,000
We will come to collect your body.

403
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,000
Sorry, we just finished taking pictures.

404
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:38,720
Yuan Song.

405
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:41,200
This is my good friend, Song Xue.

406
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,280
You know her, right?

407
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:43,920
Of course, Ms. Song.

408
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:46,200
Ms. Song, can you take a picture for us?

409
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:48,400
-Sure.
-There's no need.

410
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:49,600
I can do it.

411
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,280
Why did you get me flowers?

412
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,560
Look at the camera.

413
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,480
One, two, three.

414
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,120
All right.

415
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,720
Fanxing, take one for us.

416
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,280
What for?

417
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,000
Just do it.

418
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:18,040
You two are too stiff.

419
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,040
Try to have a bit of interaction.

420
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:29,480
Ready.

421
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,200
Done.

422
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,360
Here.

423
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:35,880
I'll buy you a meal.

424
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:38,760
It's fine.

425
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,920
Go celebrate with your friends.

426
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:43,480
Only Ms. Song knows about us, right?

427
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:45,120
I want to buy her a meal.

428
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,720
-There's no need.
-There is!

429
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,280
It's just a meal.

430
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:52,920
Let's go.

431
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,760
-I still think it's unnecessary.
-It is, let's go.

432
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:58,920
What?

433
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:37,840
Even when she has a man,
I am still number one in her heart.

434
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:42,720
It's no wonder people say that
a real best friend is the soulmate.

435
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,800
Even platonic lovers would get jealous.

436
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,000
Of course!

437
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,800
He Fanxing is my wife

438
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:51,240
and Yang Xiaoyu is my husband.

439
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:53,600
The three of us have been married
for over ten years.

440
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:57,480
Thank you for being our cover, Ms. Song.

441
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:58,960
No worries.

442
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,760
I'm doing it for my Fanxing.

443
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,920
She could have dated in school,

444
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,560
but it ended before it could even start.

445
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,480
How pitiful.

446
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:07,680
Careful, it's hot.

447
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,240
Blame it on that stupid He Canyang.

448
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:19,320
But you two managed
to wrap things up quietly.

449
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:21,920
He Fanxing.

450
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,080
Did Mr. He and Ms. Song use to date?

451
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,720
That's old news.

452
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,480
I was 16 or 17,
so I didn't have good taste in men.

453
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,440
Everyone has some dark history.

454
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:39,400
But how old were you then?

455
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,640
Five or six.
I just graduated from kindergarten.

456
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:47,240
If someone had told Fanxing at that time

457
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:50,240
that her boyfriend was flipping squares
in kindergarten,

458
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,880
she probably wouldn't believe it.

459
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:55,720
What is flipping squares?

460
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:58,760
You fold cigarette cases into a square.

461
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Have you ever played it?

462
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,600
I have never seen it before.

463
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,000
What did you guys play
in kindergarten then?

464
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,440
Minesweeper.

465
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:09,000
Are you talking about the game
on the computer?

466
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:10,760
It was fun.

467
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,680
Back then, we would compete.

468
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:14,600
The loser had to buy KFC.

469
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:21,880
What's the matter?

470
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,240
He...

471
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,680
He really is a kid.

472
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:36,240
Are you just going to chat and not eat?

473
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,040
Hurry up and order.

474
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:51,160
Aren't these your babies?

475
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,480
Are you really selling them?

476
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,160
I have to get that showerhead.

477
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,160
I have to.

478
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,320
I wouldn't buy it either
if I were your uncle.

479
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:00,160
I can live for 18 months with that money.

480
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:02,760
You have no idea
how amazing that showerhead is.

481
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,400
My life will only be complete
once I have it.

482
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:08,960
You said the same thing
when you bought that bag.

483
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:12,120
You're taking down the east wall
to fix the west wall.

484
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:17,280
A woman's wardrobe
is always missing one dress

485
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,120
and her shelf is always missing one bag.

486
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:21,800
But I can only put one showerhead
in the bathroom.

487
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,040
Hello.

488
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:35,120
Yes, I am the bag seller, Melon.

489
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,360
I am near the door,
so you should be able to see me easily.

490
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:41,160
Hello.

491
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,360
Please sit down.

492
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:49,720
Let's see the bags.

493
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:06,160
This one looks pretty good.

494
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,120
What's the price?

495
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,320
My mom bought this bag from Paris.

496
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,440
It costs 22,000 yuan.

497
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:14,240
I love it and have only used it
a few times.

498
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,800
I can sell it to you for 15,000 yuan
if you like it.

499
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,160
Hold it.

500
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:24,800
Thank you.

501
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,880
Can you sell this to me for 7,000 yuan?

502
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:29,960
I can't.

503
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:31,680
This bag is already not in the market.

504
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,600
Selling it for 12,000 yuan
is more than reasonable.

505
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:38,120
This is a secondhand bag
and you want to sell this for 12,000 yuan?

506
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:40,800
The original price was 24,000 yuan
and I have only used it 3 times.

507
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:42,800
Is the bag authentic?

508
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:44,280
It looks like an imitation.

509
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:47,320
No way, my uncle bought this
from the duty-free shop.

510
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,840
Yes, she has the receipt.

511
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:51,040
Receipts today can be faked too.

512
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,680
What? Really?

513
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:53,960
It looks fake to me.

514
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,960
She's selling so many bags.

515
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:57,280
Look at that one.

516
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,880
It doesn't even look real.

517
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,440
Is there such a design?

518
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,240
This is a limited edition embroidery.

519
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,480
Do you know anything at all?

520
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:07,240
-Forget it if you can't afford it.
-Hey.

521
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:09,040
What's with your attitude?

522
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:11,400
She's mad because we exposed her.

523
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:12,600
Didn't I tell you?

524
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,520
These secondhand bags are all fake.

525
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:15,880
What a liar!

526
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:17,840
Let's go, what a scam.

527
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,600
Hey!

528
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,600
Both of you have such foul mouths.

529
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:24,400
Who is the lying scammer?
Have you even seen the real stuff?

530
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,560
You touched her bags
with those greasy hands.

531
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:27,880
Where were your manners?

532
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,120
-You...
-Let's just go.

533
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:36,080
They can't even tell what's real,
yet they want to buy the bags?

534
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:39,360
I told you, just bring them
to a secondhand shop.

535
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:41,840
I did. They said they would
only pay me 40 percent of the price.

536
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,360
These bags are still new.

537
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,960
I should at least get 60 percent.

538
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,680
So what now? Will you still sell them?

539
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:48,920
Of course.

540
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,560
I'll be meeting other people.

541
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,840
If I don't sell them,
what about my showerhead?

542
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,680
Fine.

543
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,240
I know, Chen Xi.

544
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,440
I remember that tomorrow is your birthday.

545
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:01,960
Don't worry, I won't be late.

546
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,200
<i>What happened between you and Amy?</i>

547
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:05,600
What?

548
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,240
What about Amy?

549
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:12,920
Are you referring to her asking
my company to renovate her house?

550
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:16,960
We met and talked
for less than five minutes.

551
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:20,160
<i>She's calling you out
in the college group chat.</i>

552
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:23,240
<i>She said your colleague told her
that you don't have a boyfriend.</i>

553
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:25,760
<i>She wants us to introduce
potential suitors to you.</i>

554
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,680
Why does she care
if I have a boyfriend or not?

555
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,600
<i>You are her imaginary rival.</i>

556
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,760
-How lame.
-<i>Listen.</i>

557
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:37,200
<i>Bring your boyfriend along tomorrow.</i>

558
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:39,040
<i>Shut Amy right up.</i>

559
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,760
<i>I'm so annoyed.</i>

560
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,440
I don't think that's a good idea.

561
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:46,560
<i>Is he busy?</i>

562
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:49,400
He's...

563
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:51,720
pretty busy lately.

564
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:54,400
<i>The fire is burning
right outside your door.</i>

565
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:57,680
<i>Even if he has a million-dollar deal,
he needs to put it aside and support you!</i>

566
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:12,560
Hey, He Canyang.

567
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,920
Are you free tomorrow? I need a favor.

568
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:16,520
Why and what time?

569
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,920
It's my classmate's birthday.

570
00:34:20,199 --> 00:34:21,719
Dress up nicely and drive me there.

571
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:23,199
You can leave after that.

572
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:25,719
You should just call a taxi.

573
00:34:27,159 --> 00:34:29,360
Can I ask the taxi driver
to pretend to be my boyfriend?

574
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:33,719
He Fanxing, are you finally at the age
to care about your reputation?

575
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,040
It's not like that.

576
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:42,360
I really can't tomorrow.

577
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:44,639
I have to go to the planetarium
with my ex-girlfriend-to-be.

578
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,159
Have you two made up?

579
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:50,679
No.

580
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:55,040
She wanted to have a last date
and agreed to break up after.

581
00:34:55,639 --> 00:34:58,360
She said she wants to see
the stars with me,

582
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:01,840
so that she can end
our short-lived relationship for eternity.

583
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:05,400
-How sappy.
-Isn't it?

584
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:08,440
If I knew that she was so romantic,
I would have left her alone.

585
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:14,080
Never mind then.

586
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:19,680
It's not like I see my classmates often.

587
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,560
-Just let them be.
-Hey.

588
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:24,360
You can ask that good friend
you met on your blind date.

589
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:26,960
Single friends should help one another.

590
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:29,640
That guy is so entitled.

591
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,320
I have to be crazy to ask him.

592
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:44,080
Why should I drive you?

593
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,440
You could have hailed a taxi.

594
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:52,000
Isn't this on your way to work?

595
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:56,000
Why would I work on a weekend?

596
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:02,400
That's true.

597
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:07,760
Who are the flowers and cake for?

598
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:08,960
Is it someone's birthday?

599
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,640
My class president in college.

600
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:18,760
You can drop me off
at the hotel entrance later.

601
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:21,480
Thank you.

602
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:24,440
Okay.

603
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:47,600
Hello, Chen Xi?

604
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:49,720
Well, I have quite a lot of things.

605
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,120
Can you help me carry them?

606
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:52,640
Okay.

607
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:02,240
Are you thinking that it's weird?

608
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:04,320
Are you going to explain?

609
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:06,560
Maybe another day.

610
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,880
Can you help me carry the stuff first?

611
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:28,680
Thank you.

612
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,640
-I owe you big time.
-Fanxing?

613
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,240
Chen Xi!

614
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,920
Give them to me.

615
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:35,200
-Here.
-Chen Xi.

616
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,840
-Help me, please.
-Here.

617
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:38,680
You can go now, bye.

618
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,080
Is he your boyfriend?

619
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,320
Why isn't he joining us?

620
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:48,080
He's busy, so he's just dropping me off.

621
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:50,200
He's so handsome.

622
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,480
-Do you want to hide him from us?
-No.

623
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,720
I'll leave the stuff here.

624
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:06,880
She's here.

625
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:10,880
Come sit here.

626
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:12,320
-Here.
-Okay.

627
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,240
Sorry for being late.

628
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:15,440
Well...

629
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,960
Aren't you supposed
to bring your boyfriend?

630
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,200
Is he not coming?

631
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:21,480
He's busy, so he can't come.

632
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:24,560
Is he busy even on the weekends?

633
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:26,640
Don't mention it anymore.

634
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:29,520
Her boyfriend left
right after he dropped her off.

635
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,800
I caught a glimpse of him at the door.

636
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:35,880
Even an old woman like me
felt my heart beating faster!

637
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,520
He is really handsome!

638
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:38,960
-Really?
-Yes.

639
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,320
Did you really see him?

640
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,400
Yes, I did.

641
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:45,720
He and Fanxing make a great pair.

642
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,360
No way!

643
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:49,040
Handsome?

644
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,400
He can't be more handsome than me.

645
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:51,960
You?

646
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,720
You're like a monkey.
You can hold his shoes.

647
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:57,880
Everyone's here.

648
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:59,720
I'll ask them to serve the food.

649
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,520
Chen Xi, it's your birthday.

650
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,240
Just sit down, I'll go instead.

651
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:06,160
Amy, it seems like
your information is wrong.

652
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,960
I heard it from He Fanxing's colleague.

653
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:10,840
About what?

654
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:12,360
I never told them.

655
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:14,680
That's strange. Why wouldn't you?

656
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,440
That's strange. Why should I?

657
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,560
Why would you hide your relationship
from your colleagues?

658
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,520
Why should I inform everyone?

659
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:25,920
That's right.

660
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:30,800
I don't think there's a need to announce
personal matters publicly as well.

661
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:32,880
You guys don't know this.

662
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:37,200
Back in college, Fanxing was
already good friends with Haomiao.

663
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:39,200
Fanxing and I are so close,

664
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:41,280
but I only found out after graduation.

665
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:44,880
I thought she was going to join the CIA.

666
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:47,800
What a touching story.

667
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:49,920
Let's give the married man a chance today.

668
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:50,920
Come on.

669
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:52,840
Thank you so much.

670
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:55,400
She couldn't care less about me now.

671
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:57,720
Let us mend the friendship.

672
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:00,560
Right, Fanxing?

673
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:05,440
Okay, I guess I'm a busybody.

674
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:07,240
There's such a story though.

675
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:11,320
A mature lady rented a fancy car
and a boyfriend on Valentine's Day

676
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:14,000
just to show off to her friends.

677
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,280
Isn't it?

678
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:22,200
He left after dropping her off.

679
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:25,600
He was able to drive her here,
yet he couldn't stay for a meal?

680
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:30,680
If I had really rented a car
and a boyfriend,

681
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:33,600
a normal person would have
at least feigned ignorance.

682
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:36,640
I just think that there's no need
to lie to your old friends.

683
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:38,440
We have known each other for years.

684
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:41,600
We can always help you out
if you're single.

685
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:46,800
The one thinking that
those who are single need help

686
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,120
is the one who needs help.

687
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:51,800
Can't you live your own life
without meddling in the lives of others?

688
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:54,840
-I'm leaving.
-Fanxing.

689
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:55,760
Don't.

690
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:58,480
Don't be angry, that's how she is.

691
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:00,560
It's my birthday today.

692
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,920
I don't mind
if certain people didn't come,

693
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,360
but you have to stay.

694
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:05,600
He Fanxing.

695
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,080
Don't misunderstand.

696
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:09,480
I was trying to help.
I didn't mean any harm.

697
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:11,120
Just consider that I'm too dense then.

698
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,000
Why are you here?

699
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:24,960
I knocked. I guess no one heard me.

700
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:26,800
Who is he?

701
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:28,880
Who's that?

702
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:31,120
Please sit.

703
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:33,760
I'm sorry, let me introduce myself.

704
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:36,800
I'm Ye Luming, Fanxing's boyfriend.

705
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:39,840
I had something to do,

706
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,080
but then I thought
I should accompany her instead.

707
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:44,560
Whose birthday is it?

708
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,440
Hello, I am Chen Xi.

709
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:48,640
Their class president.

710
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:50,480
Fanxing mentioned you a lot.

711
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:52,760
Thank you for looking after Fanxing.

712
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:54,960
-Happy birthday.
-Thank you.

713
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:57,360
I'm so glad you could make it.

714
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:58,360
Please sit.

715
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:00,840
-Hey, clear the seat.
-Yes, I should.

716
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:02,920
Thank you.

717
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,560
Waiter, another chair, please.

718
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:08,520
It's no surprise Fanxing
didn't dare to show him to us.

719
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:11,040
A handsome man like him
might get snatched away.

720
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:12,280
-Right.
-Right.

721
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:13,360
It's fine with me.

722
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:15,280
I'm more worried
that she will be taken away instead.

723
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:17,080
It's a good thing you came.

724
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:18,120
Listen.

725
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:22,240
This guy here was the one who stood
in front of everyone at graduation

726
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:24,360
-and--
-Chen Xi!

727
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:26,920
Spare me, I just got married last month.

728
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:28,560
All right, I'll stop.

729
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:30,080
A newlywed? Congratulations.

730
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:31,560
-I'll toast to you.
-Thank you.

731
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:37,960
