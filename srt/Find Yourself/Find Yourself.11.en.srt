1
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,880
Professor He, I swear.

2
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,480
I won't say a word about you
and Professor Song.

3
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,680
My lips are sealed.

4
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,280
What about putting glue on my chair?

5
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,400
Can you let that go?

6
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,920
Sure.

7
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,240
But I'll do the same
and you have to sit on it too.

8
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,400
I'll let you change into jeans first.

9
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,360
That is like an eye for an eye.

10
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,880
How can a professor do this?

11
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,320
It would be fine if you apologized,

12
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,120
but you chose to run when you saw me.

13
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,600
When a slacker like me sees a professor,
I'd definitely run.

14
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:39,480
Why should I make myself
get noticed by you?

15
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,240
If you don't remember me,

16
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,840
you might let me pass out of impulse.

17
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,480
If you had used your wits
for your studies,

18
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,560
Professor Song would smile
even in her sleep.

19
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,040
Are you two still sleeping together?

20
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,560
How do you know what she does
when she sleeps?

21
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,760
Ms. Cai Minmin.

22
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,120
There's something wrong with your mind.

23
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,080
Can't we be best friends?

24
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,520
Does this mean you're gay?

25
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,720
Of course not.

26
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,400
Something is wrong then.

27
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,440
If a man and a woman are best friends,

28
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,880
that means the man is interested
in the woman.

29
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:19,320
If the woman likes the man,
she will become his friend.

30
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,760
It's called befriending someone first
before winning him over.

31
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,520
Who taught you these things?

32
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,000
My uncle did. He's incredible.

33
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,760
Now, he's using this method
to woo my future aunt.

34
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,040
Did your uncle tell you

35
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,920
that this is a double-edged sword?

36
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,480
It's not a long-term strategy.

37
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,480
If you're in the same spot for too long,

38
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,560
you'll get stuck.

39
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:42,240
Then, it will be hard
for that person to like you.

40
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,680
-Really?
-Would a professor lie?

41
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,920
Are you and Yuan Song friends now?

42
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,000
You tricked me!

43
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,040
Fine, it's all right.

44
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:03,400
The whole school knows
I was rejected by Yuan Song.

45
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,480
It's okay, I have thick skin.

46
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,120
I like him anyway.

47
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,400
Okay.

48
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,720
You two are compatible,

49
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,480
but not suitable.

50
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,080
What do you mean?

51
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:19,920
How's your monthly spending?

52
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,080
Monthly spending?

53
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,480
Look at your clothes.

54
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,200
Your shoes.

55
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,240
Your bag.

56
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,480
And your makeup.

57
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,400
Yuan Song is an intern.

58
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,120
His pay is only 3,000 yuan per month.

59
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,960
So little?

60
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,040
He doesn't have to support me. I'm rich.

61
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,680
Yes! I can support him.

62
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:41,560
Let's set aside whether a man would agree
for you to support him or not.

63
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,040
Think about the source of your money.

64
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,040
Will the person who gives you money
agree to that?

65
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,200
<i>Right.</i>

66
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,960
<i>It's my parents' and uncle's money.</i>

67
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,600
<i>Not my own money.</i>

68
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,800
<i>If your old boyfriend who drives
an expensive car</i>

69
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,120
<i>knows his money is going to someone else,</i>

70
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,040
<i>he would tear Yuan Song apart.</i>

71
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,640
You are

72
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,120
at a materialistic age.

73
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:06,000
You want to dress well, eat well
and use good things.

74
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,080
This is normal.

75
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,600
But whatever you obtain too easily
will also get lost easily.

76
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,560
Based on my experience,

77
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,280
it's best to depend on yourself.

78
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,400
After I graduate,

79
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,800
I'll work hard and earn my own money.

80
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,200
But it's okay.

81
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,920
You're still young.

82
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,680
You'll grow after making some mistakes.

83
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,440
Are you sure she'll like the necklace?

84
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,160
I'm not.

85
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,080
However, a simple and elegant necklace
like that matches everything.

86
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,240
You can't go wrong with it.

87
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,120
What's the matter?

88
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,440
You like this car?

89
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,720
It's my brother's car.

90
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:01,880
Go, get your car.

91
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,680
<i>Hello?</i>

92
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,400
Where are you?

93
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,640
<i>I'm at home.</i>

94
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:22,680
<i>What's up?</i>

95
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,600
Then, stay there.

96
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,640
<i>Tell me honestly.</i>

97
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:41,400
<i>This afternoon, did He Canyang
say anything while I was away?</i>

98
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,240
<i>What do you think he'll say?</i>

99
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,040
<i>Don't try to fish for information.</i>

100
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,640
<i>You're guilty. Something's up.</i>

101
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,640
<i>Next.</i>

102
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,680
<i>Don't ask me.</i>

103
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:50,960
<i>I don't know anything.</i>

104
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,320
<i>You're not going to talk?</i>

105
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:56,360
<i>I saw his car in the mall's car park.</i>

106
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,040
SOPHISTICATED LADIES

107
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,240
Get in.

108
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,200
<i>Don't be mad, Fanxing.</i>

109
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,640
<i>Go back and ask Doggy.</i>

110
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,360
<i>Why aren't you replying?</i>

111
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,600
<i>You're making me anxious!</i>

112
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,760
He Fanxing.

113
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,160
You're prioritizing your boyfriend
over your friend.

114
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,400
How dare you chat
with your boyfriend in my car?

115
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,120
It's not my boyfriend.

116
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,280
They are my girlfriends.

117
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,320
I see.

118
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,600
Do you have a date
with your boyfriend tomorrow?

119
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,200
Yes.

120
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,120
This is for you.

121
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,520
Thanks for taking care of Love Charm.

122
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,680
Isn't this for your future girlfriend?

123
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,640
There's another one inside the bag.

124
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,960
I bought an extra one for you,

125
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,720
so you can't say no.

126
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,120
Hey, you chose that yourself.

127
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,520
So you must like it.

128
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,400
I do,

129
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,560
but this is too expensive.

130
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,920
You asked me out
to help you choose a present.

131
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:38,560
And you gave me one too.

132
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,640
Why do I feel

133
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,240
like...

134
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:43,920
Like...

135
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,320
Like what?

136
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,600
Like I like you?

137
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,040
He Fanxing.

138
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,680
You always say what's uncalled for.

139
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:58,000
If I can fall for two girls
at the same time,

140
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:00,000
would I still be single now?

141
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,160
I guess you have a point.

142
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:06,640
If you don't want it,
I'll give it to my niece.

143
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,080
Think about it.

144
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,840
You've helped me a lot
since you found Love Charm.

145
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,520
If it were me, I'd feel cheated.

146
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,240
True!

147
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,480
I even bought you a meal.

148
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:26,880
Do you think it's because
you look like a nice person?

149
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,120
That's why
I don't find you stingy anymore.

150
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,360
You're right.

151
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,080
I am stingy. Give it back.

152
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,720
You can't take back

153
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,360
a present that you've given away.

154
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:44,320
I'll look so pretty wearing it
to see my boyfriend tomorrow.

155
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,200
<i>Okay, I'll tell!</i>

156
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,400
<i>I'm dying from keeping quiet!</i>

157
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,240
<i>Your whole family</i>

158
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,160
<i>is suspecting that</i>

159
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,800
<i>you're currently infatuated</i>

160
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:06,360
<i> with an old hunk in his 30s or 40s
who drives an expensive car.</i>

161
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,480
<i>You've lost it and became his mistress.</i>

162
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:16,320
<i>I'm perfectly sure that's impossible.</i>

163
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,960
CONFUSED

164
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:20,080
<i>They suspect that you wouldn't
be able to control yourself.</i>

165
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,080
<i>I'm not worried at all.</i>

166
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,920
<i>Are you even human, Professor Song?</i>

167
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,160
<i>Don't put the blame on me now!</i>

168
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,200
<i>Okay?</i>

169
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,320
What is it?

170
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,200
You do look like

171
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,440
an old hunk in his 30s or 40s
who drives an expensive car.

172
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,640
What "old hunk"?

173
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,320
Why not "big hunk"?

174
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,160
Also, I just turned 37.

175
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,640
I'm still far from 40.

176
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,840
Don't call me old.

177
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,520
Okay.

178
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,560
Big old hunk.

179
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,560
Get out!

180
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,040
I will not.

181
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:13,040
<i>The other three awards are
National Natural Science Award...</i>

182
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,640
Mom, Dad, I'm home!

183
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,880
<i>National Progress in Science
and Technology Award...</i>

184
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,800
Why are you home so early?

185
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,320
To have dinner with you two.

186
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,520
I'll go get changed.

187
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:25,920
Baylor.

188
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,200
Our daughter looks unhappy.

189
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,720
I think

190
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,200
she looks tired.

191
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,320
Tell me.

192
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,640
Should I ask her about it?

193
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,040
Where did she go this afternoon?

194
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,680
Who did she meet?

195
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:50,160
Don't ask it that way.
You sound like an interrogator.

196
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,160
She has to lie
if she doesn't want to tell you.

197
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,880
Fanxing has always been very honest
since she was little.

198
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,960
Everyone lies.

199
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:02,440
The difference is

200
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:05,520
some lie the moment they open their mouths
with no limits.

201
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,760
But some people will blame themselves

202
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,320
and feel guilty after lying.

203
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,880
Our daughter is the latter.

204
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,320
Baylor.

205
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,760
Dad, please pass me the brush.

206
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,640
Why did you come home alone?
Where's Canyang?

207
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,040
Him?

208
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,760
He must still be in the mall now.

209
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:33,080
My friend and I saw his car
at the mall's car park.

210
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,160
Let me tell you.

211
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,120
I've only known my friend

212
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,320
for a short time,

213
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,040
yet we're so fated to meet each other.

214
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,040
Didn't I take a poodle home before?

215
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,640
I asked the owner to meet me at the park.

216
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,960
Guess what happened when I arrived?

217
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,120
He's the head of the advertising agency

218
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,000
who has been working with us for so long.

219
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,080
But most of all,

220
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,560
the senior of one of our colleagues

221
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,240
set her up for a blind date.

222
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,480
However,

223
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,320
she was dating someone back then.

224
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,640
So they set me up instead.

225
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
When I got there,

226
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:08,920
it was him again!

227
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,360
What a coincidence, right?

228
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,560
But he's in love with someone else.

229
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:15,400
He went on the date
because his sister forced him.

230
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,320
We get along pretty well,

231
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,040
but just as friends though.

232
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,680
This afternoon, he asked me out

233
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,680
to help him pick a birthday present
for his girl.

234
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,240
A few nights ago,

235
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,800
when he drove me home
after visiting his dog,

236
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:30,920
we met Mrs. Wang.

237
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,200
However,

238
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:36,560
I think Mrs. Wang misunderstood.

239
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,240
Never mind. It doesn't matter.

240
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,360
It's not even real.

241
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,400
So, there's no need to explain, right?

242
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,160
Yes, right.

243
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:48,840
Yes.

244
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,840
Why do you need to explain?

245
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:54,280
Expand your network
by having more friends. That's good.

246
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,280
Yes.

247
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,000
How old is he?

248
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,600
He's about four
or five years older than me.

249
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,080
Has he been married before?

250
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,080
No.

251
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:08,440
I think he broke up with his ex-girlfriend
a few years ago.

252
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,760
He has been busy
with his career ever since.

253
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,400
He seems stable.

254
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:15,840
What does he do?

255
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,720
He runs his own company.

256
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:19,800
He's quite talented too.

257
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:22,680
-Hey--
-Don't.

258
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,240
With a friend like that,

259
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,080
we'll feel at ease.

260
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,680
Dad, Mom.

261
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,040
Did you eat fried chicken again?

262
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,120
Your dad wanted it.

263
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,240
You ate a lot too.

264
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,960
Didn't you say you cleaned it all up?

265
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:05,040
I told you not to feed the dog,
but you wouldn't listen.

266
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:05,960
You...

267
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,640
You even gave it to Baylor?

268
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,800
No, he ate the meat!

269
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,120
I ate the bones.

270
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,920
Do you admit your mistake?

271
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,120
-We do.
-We do.

272
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,480
-We were wrong.
-Yes.

273
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,840
I forgot to spray the air freshener.

274
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,120
What kind of attitude is that?

275
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,760
Exactly! How can you forget that?

276
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,680
Didn't you forget it too?

277
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:29,760
You told me to clean up, finish everything
and keep it from our daughter.

278
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,640
So I ate and you offered to clean.

279
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,320
He told me to eat it here!

280
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,120
Tell me, why am I...

281
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,400
Hold on.

282
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,960
Waiter, another roasted lamb leg.

283
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:56,960
Okay.

284
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,360
You ordered so much food.

285
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,440
Can you finish them?

286
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,840
I can if I eat slowly.

287
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:04,920
You ate so little.

288
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:06,960
If I eat more now,

289
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,000
I have to run
an extra ten kilometers tomorrow.

290
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,160
What do you think?

291
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:14,360
Old people are so pitiful.

292
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,600
They have to worry about dark circles
after staying up late,

293
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:18,760
excess fat,

294
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,440
and their calories count too.

295
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,520
You better say things nicely.

296
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,560
You'll get old too.

297
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,640
I always apply masks, so I'll age slower.

298
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,000
Do you like the necklace so much?

299
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,360
You're even wearing it now.

300
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,040
I like it.

301
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,640
My aunt has good taste.

302
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:44,880
Aunt?

303
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,000
Can't I call her that?

304
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,760
Let me hear it again.

305
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,560
Aunt...

306
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:55,480
Aunt.

307
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,120
Aunt!

308
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,600
A red packet for you!

309
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:03,360
I love you, Uncle.

310
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,400
I thought today was my unlucky day.

311
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,560
I met my elective class teacher,
Professor He.

312
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,960
The guy who thinks highly of himself.

313
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,440
One of my classmates

314
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,200
even found her perfect lip color
on his car window.

315
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:18,520
What happened?

316
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,800
Did he give you a hard time?

317
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,320
He bought me dessert.

318
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,080
Why did he buy you dessert?

319
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:29,520
To give me life advice.

320
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,920
He says I'm not compatible with my senior

321
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,640
since he earns too little

322
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,120
and I spend too much
and can't be independent.

323
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,720
Something like that.

324
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,520
I see.

325
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:42,600
But this is the first time
I thought he was nice.

326
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,560
I think he told me those things
for my own good.

327
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,240
Don't you always say that a good advice

328
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:49,200
is harsh on the ears but good for you?

329
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,760
Stay away from him from now on.

330
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,800
Who knows if he has ulterior motives?

331
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,280
An undergraduate obviously earns little.

332
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,800
He's an assistant professor
with a stable income.

333
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:02,840
What does he want?

334
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,360
He's seducing you with money.

335
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:05,960
Don't forget.

336
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,600
He's your professor indeed,

337
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,240
but he's still a man.

338
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,080
Do you mean he wants to sleep with me?

339
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,080
Pretty much.

340
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,760
So in Professor He's eyes,

341
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,240
I'm a pretty woman too.

342
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,440
Ma'am, I haven't gotten
my roasted lamb leg yet!

343
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:31,560
It'll be there right away!

344
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:41,960
Done.

345
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:43,920
Let's go.

346
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,320
Nice necklace.

347
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,040
Thanks. Let's go.

348
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:04,920
Can you play?

349
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,200
Not too well.

350
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:08,640
Me neither.

351
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,640
Let's play for fun.

352
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,240
Here.

353
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,920
<i>It's time to test my acting skills again.</i>

354
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,480
<i>I must protect his pride.</i>

355
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,400
<i>I can't win.</i>

356
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,840
<i>The most important thing is
to make her happy.</i>

357
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:53,640
Look at Wang Xin.

358
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,240
She's left-handed,

359
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,800
but she's still so good.

360
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,840
Of course. She's on the national team.

361
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,600
Back then, Xingxing had such potential.

362
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,360
We have a district team coach

363
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,920
living right here in our community.

364
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:12,000
He asked her to play,

365
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,720
but she refused.

366
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,800
If she had continued training,

367
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,200
maybe we'd have

368
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:20,560
a world champion in our family.

369
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,200
By the way,

370
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,600
I think she went out

371
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,960
to play badminton
with her colleague today.

372
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:35,840
That's bad.

373
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,520
Will she offend her colleague?

374
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,640
Catch it, He Fanxing!

375
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,520
<i>Way to go, He Fanxing!</i>

376
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,280
<i>Quell your urge to win.</i>

377
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:52,200
<i>It's unworthy in the face of love.</i>

378
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,920
Sorry, my mistake.

379
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:06,840
It's okay.

380
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,960
The point is to make your opponent miss.

381
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:12,800
Come on.

382
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,440
Sorry.

383
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:30,920
My mistake.

384
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,320
It's fine.

385
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,400
The point is to make your opponent miss.

386
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:55,120
<i>The two players are now warmed up.</i>

387
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,600
<i>A big match is coming up!</i>

388
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,800
<i>We now see He Fanxing.</i>

389
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:02,360
<i>A veteran born in 1987.</i>

390
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:03,520
<i>In past competitions,</i>

391
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,600
<i>she has defeated all the members
of the senior dance club,</i>

392
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:08,040
<i>maintaining her outstanding score
of zero defeat.</i>

393
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,920
<i>Now to the young fighter born in 1997.</i>

394
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,480
<i>Compared to He Fanxing,</i>

395
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:14,080
<i>his skills are far from honed.</i>

396
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,720
<i>But he attacks fiercely!</i>

397
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,040
<i>He's a budding player.</i>

398
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:19,640
<i>Yuan Song's fans outside the court
are cheering for him!</i>

399
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,040
<i>It's a feisty match!</i>

400
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,000
<i>Corner shot!</i>

401
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,680
<i>Yuan Song steps in for the kill.</i>

402
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,800
<i>He Fanxing catches it!</i>

403
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,920
<i>Yuan Song smashes! Nice!</i>

404
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,240
What's wrong?

405
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:39,960
I sprained my neck.

406
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:46,160
Is it serious?
Should we go to the hospital?

407
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:47,760
I'm fine.

408
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,320
Maybe I spun my head

409
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,680
too hard.

410
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,520
Are you okay, miss?

411
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,600
I'm fine. I'll just rest for a while.

412
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:55,680
Thank you.

413
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:56,760
You played so well.

414
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:58,840
We wanted to ask if we could join.

415
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:01,480
Why don't you guys play then?

416
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:02,640
I'll just watch.

417
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:03,680
Really?

418
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,600
You're so skilled.

419
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,760
-We'll play tag team against you.
-Tag team.

420
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,040
Then, it would be fair.

421
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,680
Why don't we pass?

422
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,440
No, you can play.

423
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,840
It's okay, I'll sit on the side.

424
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:17,000
I don't want to go home yet anyway.

425
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:19,920
Okay then.

426
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:23,040
-Rest a bit.
-Okay.

427
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,760
Let's play.

428
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:49,800
Hey.

429
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,800
Did you see how that woman is dressed?

430
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,000
She's not 17 or 18.

431
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,880
Is she trying to look young?

432
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,320
Don't keep calling her woman.

433
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,080
She's not that old.

434
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,200
She must be capable
to have such a boyfriend.

435
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,520
Suck it up.

436
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,520
Do you think they are a couple?

437
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,440
I don't think so.

438
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,360
They must be.

439
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,080
I can see it in their eyes.

440
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,720
When they were playing,
he kept looking at her.

441
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,800
I think he was looking at me.

442
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,480
He was looking at the shuttlecock.

443
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,200
You think too much.

444
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,000
Tell me.

445
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,280
Is that guy a part-timer?

446
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:27,600
Part-timer?

447
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:30,600
A handsome university student

448
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:32,760
with a rich woman.

449
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:35,000
They always get what they want.

450
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:37,760
I don't see it.

451
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,640
Didn't you see his unlabeled sneakers?

452
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,480
That's a global limited edition.

453
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:44,920
It's over 20,000 yuan.

454
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,920
You also bought that branded bag

455
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:50,000
after saving for many months, right?

456
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:03,000
The ice cream here is very delicious.
It's made from animal fat.

457
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,160
It's different
from the ones outside. Try it.

458
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,800
-Thanks for playing with my boyfriend.
-Thank you.

459
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,560
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

460
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:23,080
Please stop buying things for me.

461
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,480
I don't need anything.

462
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,920
Really. Thanks, Meiyin.

463
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:30,120
I have a job and everything I need now.

464
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:32,800
I'm doing well,
so don't go to my school again.

465
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,000
That's all, bye.

466
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:41,840
When did you come?

467
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:43,480
Just now.

468
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:46,000
Let's go and eat.

469
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,760
I don't want to eat out.

470
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,000
Let's go to your place. I'll cook.

471
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,080
Okay.

472
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,000
He Fanxing.

473
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,800
Can I come in and help?

474
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:08,880
Don't come in!

475
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,200
What's wrong, He Fanxing?

476
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:33,320
There's nothing wrong.

477
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:45,840
RECIPE

478
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,920
Is something burning, He Fanxing?

479
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,160
Nothing!

480
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,360
Nothing is burning!

481
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,320
That means...

482
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,680
Your girl is dating another guy now.

483
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:17,640
But you're playing billiards with me
with such a calm disposition.

484
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,640
That guy is on an open road

485
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,720
and I'm on a secret path.

486
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:26,440
I was only temporarily subdued by him.

487
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,160
However, a calm disposition is

488
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,840
what it takes to win.

489
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,440
Not bad.

490
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:38,560
But I don't see a miracle
for you to win anywhere.

491
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,760
There's a situation

492
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,680
called backfiring.

493
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,560
A ten-year gap is no small issue.

494
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:50,040
Breaking up is only a matter of time.

495
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:52,600
However, I think

496
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:53,840
age is not an issue.

497
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:56,160
My wife and I have a ten-year gap.

498
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,720
Men and women are different.

499
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,080
Women mature faster emotionally.

500
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:02,600
They grow faster physically too.

501
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,320
They live longer lives as well.

502
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:07,840
They go through a transformation,
especially after giving birth.

503
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,880
Men will never understand it.

504
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,680
I remember the last time
you had dinner with us.

505
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,400
My wife said

506
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:17,720
you were more mature than me.

507
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,360
Looking at the way you please women,

508
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,880
I think you're second to none.

509
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,280
Let me correct you.

510
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:26,400
It's not pleasing,

511
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:27,960
but empathizing.

512
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:30,680
After all, my sister raised me.

513
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,440
I have a lovely niece too.

514
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:34,440
I just often think

515
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,320
from their perspective.

516
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:39,840
That means

517
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,600
it's no use pleasing her.

518
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,360
The girl you like is into someone else.

519
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,520
You're just like a fly

520
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,600
hovering around her.

521
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,960
Excuse me, it's my turn.

522
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,040
Why am I a fly?

523
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,640
Why can't I be a bee?

524
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:01,560
All the same.

525
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:02,920
You're just buzzing around.

526
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:04,280
How annoying.

527
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:05,920
It's not the same.

528
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:08,080
Bees are hardworking bugs.

529
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,480
Flies are the annoying ones.

530
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,040
They're similar.

531
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:19,880
What do couples these days do
when they date?

532
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,360
Strolling in the streets

533
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,040
or sitting at the parks?

534
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:25,480
Sounds boring.

535
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,320
What else?

536
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,440
Eat, watch movies and go to hotels.

537
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,080
Quite boring, right?

538
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:33,840
My son told me that.

539
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,600
I didn't know you're a good cook.

540
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,720
I live alone,
so I have to look after myself.

541
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:52,960
I have to know how to cook.

542
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,880
I only live with my family.

543
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:59,440
My parents are good cooks.

544
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,160
They never let me cook.

545
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:04,560
The top three dishes I can make are

546
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:08,560
scrambled eggs,
fried eggs and boiled eggs.

547
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,120
That's incredible.

548
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,160
It's your specialty.
You're a professional egg killer.

549
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:13,880
Have a taste.

550
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,160
See if you like it.

551
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:16,240
Sure.

552
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:27,880
It's delicious!

553
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,120
Right? It's how my mom cooks it.

554
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,080
My mom can only cook curry well.

555
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:34,400
My dad and I suspect
she was an Indian in her past life.

556
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,080
Really?

557
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:40,120
What do your parents do?

558
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,920
My mom researches plants

559
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:45,960
at the Leye Sinkhole in Guangxi.

560
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,960
She has low funding and sponsorship
with a bunch of assistants to feed.

561
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,040
So she's a botanist.

562
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,040
Then your dad is...

563
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,560
A geographer?

564
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:58,920
No.

565
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,120
My dad is

566
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,960
a regular office worker.

567
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,360
They divorced when I was
in primary school.

568
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:07,040
But we're still a family.

569
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,840
My grandparents raised me.

570
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,120
During summer,

571
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:13,080
my dad would take me to Guangxi
and meet up with my mom too.

572
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:14,680
When school starts,

573
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:16,600
they'd pick me up from Guangxi.

574
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:18,200
Later on,

575
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,200
she had a new boyfriend,
who is her colleague.

576
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,320
There was a time

577
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:24,440
when they argued over their research.

578
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:26,560
And they both called my dad to rant.

579
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,840
He turned off his phone
because they were so annoying.

580
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:32,560
So they're really close then?

581
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,840
That's what they call
a love-hate relationship.

582
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:45,560
Where's my necklace?

583
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,640
<i>Is that guy a part-timer?</i>

584
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:10,880
Part-timer?

585
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,320
A handsome university student

586
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,320
with a rich woman.

587
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,640
They always get what they want.

588
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,400
I don't see it.

589
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:22,080
Didn't you see his unlabeled sneakers?

590
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:24,760
<i>That's a global limited edition.</i>

591
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,240
<i>It's over 20,000 yuan.</i>

592
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,360
I can't find it.

593
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,720
Did it snap when you were
playing badminton?

594
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:34,600
What's wrong?

595
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:39,680
Nothing. I think

596
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,560
these sneakers look nice.

597
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:43,320
What brand is this?

598
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,920
I can buy one for Canyang too.

599
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,560
I don't know either.

600
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,920
A relative gave it to me on my birthday.

601
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,240
Forget it.

602
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,480
It's okay if it's lost.

603
00:32:58,720 --> 00:32:59,640
Let's eat.

604
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,160
Yes, let's eat.

605
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:03,520
Let's go.

606
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,960
<i>Please stop buying things for me.</i>

607
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:21,320
<i>I don't need anything.</i>

608
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,160
Really. Thanks, Meiyin.

609
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,400
I have a job and everything I need now.

610
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,520
I'm doing well,
so don't go to my school again.

611
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,640
That's all, bye.

612
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:36,560
Who was he on the phone with?

613
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:39,200
He's so secretive.

614
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,160
The more I worry, the more trouble I get.

615
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:50,640
Stop thinking.

616
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:53,800
Sleep!

617
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:55,480
Sleep!

618
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,400
Hello?

619
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,520
<i>He Fanxing!</i>

620
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:22,480
<i>Love Charm is covered in icing.</i>

621
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:23,800
<i>How should I bathe him?</i>

622
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:27,800
Ask the vet.

623
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:29,960
<i>The vet said to bathe him without water.</i>

624
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:32,040
<i>How can I bathe him without water?</i>

625
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:33,520
<i>Is there dry cleaning for pets?</i>

626
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,320
<i>Love Charm!</i>

627
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,640
<i> Don't jump on the couch!</i>

628
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,120
<i>What's wrong?</i>

629
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:45,200
My neck!

630
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:46,400
<i>Neck?</i>

631
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:47,560
<i>What's with your neck?</i>

632
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:50,640
It's broken.

633
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:02,960
Let's go.

634
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:05,600
You look like

635
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,040
a dog

636
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:09,720
who broke her neck.

637
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:12,920
Thanks for the compliment.

638
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:14,640
Don't mention it.

639
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,360
How much longer do you intend
to laugh at me?

640
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:21,800
Aren't you taking me to
the old Chinese physician you know?

641
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,360
After you.

642
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:35,720
Cong Xiao?

643
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,200
Li Zhenzhen?

644
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:39,400
-What a coincidence!
-Yes.

645
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,440
Take the sandwich. I'll get the bread.

646
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,120
It's okay, you can have it.

647
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,200
I was going to get some Nongfu Spring.

648
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:46,440
Excuse me.

649
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:56,920
How is your florist boyfriend?

650
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:59,560
Don't ask. We broke up.

651
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:02,040
You know, he's a total jerk.

652
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,600
He was actually flirting with other girls
at the same time.

653
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:08,080
And he gave us his secondary credit cards
to check if we're gold diggers.

654
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,040
Don't you think he's sick?

655
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,680
He's just a florist!

656
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,440
He thinks he's so rich.

657
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:15,320
How did you find out?

658
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,720
I went to his shop one day after work.

659
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,360
Coincidentally, a guy was there

660
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,000
to stand up for his friend.

661
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,000
He beat him up.

662
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:25,320
And said he'll follow him
wherever he goes for blind dates.

663
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:27,520
He'll let every girl know

664
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:28,920
that he's a cheater.

665
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:30,480
Really?

666
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:31,480
Yes.

667
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,320
The guy may have the guts,

668
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,920
but not the strength.

669
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,120
Here and here.

670
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:37,720
He got beaten up pretty bad.

671
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:41,000
His first name was Chang,
but I don't remember his last name.

672
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:43,640
<i>Now I know why you were beaten.</i>

673
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:45,320
It is because of how mean you are.

674
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:46,760
You deserve to be beaten.

675
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,720
Yes, I deserve it.

676
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,560
I brought it upon myself.

677
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,200
I really don't know what to say.

678
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,120
You are 27, 28 years old now.

679
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,640
Can't you be more reliable?

680
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:58,680
Couldn't you solve the problem properly?

681
00:36:58,760 --> 00:36:59,920
Was fighting necessary?

682
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:01,280
Are you a gangster?

683
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,840
That was really low.

684
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:06,200
<i>Never mind, he wasn't handsome anyway.</i>

685
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,640
But I think

686
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:12,280
that guy must like his friend.

687
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,760
Otherwise, why would he stand up for her?

688
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,040
Am I right?

689
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,080
Chang Huan.

690
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,560
You have rashes!

691
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:48,960
Rashes?

692
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:51,640
Is it not a mosquito bite?

693
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:52,760
No.

694
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,160
I'll take a picture.

695
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,160
Okay.

696
00:37:58,520 --> 00:37:59,440
See?

697
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:04,640
It must be from the humidity.

698
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:05,920
You're worn out from work,

699
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,960
and your immune system is weak.
So you get rashes.

700
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,840
Don't scratch, it'll itch even more.

701
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,720
You know quite a lot.

702
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:13,760
Of course.

703
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,320
I have many more strengths.

704
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,640
Try to discover them.

705
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,600
What? Are you
the Black Mountain Old Witch?

706
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,840
Do you like Qingqing?

707
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:32,400
Are you nuts?

708
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,560
She's so young!

709
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:37,080
She's already close
to the late marriage age.

710
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:38,640
She's only six or seven years
younger than you.

711
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,960
-Aren't you a good match?
-Cut the nonsense.

712
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:43,200
We have a huge age gap.

713
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,200
I can't accept it.

714
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,520
A geek like you

715
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,520
should be fine

716
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:52,360
with any breathing woman.

717
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:54,800
You're underestimating me.

718
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,840
If you have an issue with gender,

719
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:58,520
I'm open to discussion.

720
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:00,800
You're sick!

721
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:02,160
This is 6.50 yuan.

722
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:03,240
I just saved 6.50 yuan.

723
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,440
Thanks!

724
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:11,920
<i>Having someone who likes you</i>

725
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,280
<i>is better than none at all.</i>

726
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:24,200
Ms. He.

727
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,400
Yes?

728
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:27,400
Speak up.

729
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,440
I'll treat you to a meal.

730
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:34,240
I'm getting a bad feeling.

731
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:36,480
Let's go.

732
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,520
Is this a banquet?

733
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:48,200
I'll get an Australian Wagyu set.

734
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,600
The foie gras salad is good too.

735
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,000
Do you want to try it?

736
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,040
Sure, I'll have the same.

737
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:55,960
Thanks.

738
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:57,120
Please wait.

739
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,040
-Place the order.
-Okay.

740
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:04,200
About what happened last time,

741
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:05,600
that was my mistake.

742
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:09,240
So this meal is my apology to you.

743
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:11,640
Fine.

744
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:12,640
I accept it.

745
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:14,160
Let the matter rest.

746
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,160
It's pretty good.

747
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:25,920
I knew you'd like it.

748
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:32,400
By the way,

749
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,360
aren't you close friends

750
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,720
with T-Rex already?

751
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:38,360
Can you introduce him to me?

752
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:41,120
I knew something was up.

753
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,680
Can't there be

754
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:47,160
more sincerity and fewer tricks
between people?

755
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,160
Since you don't like him,

756
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,000
why don't you introduce him
to your friends?

757
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:55,200
Just ask your senior
to arrange another date for you.

758
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:57,880
He lied to her, saying it was successful.

759
00:40:58,160 --> 00:40:59,880
That means he won't go again.

760
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,960
Why should I embarrass myself?

761
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,360
He's already in love with someone.

762
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:05,560
If I set you up,

763
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:06,960
that's not right.

764
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,360
He's not married yet.

765
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:10,960
I'll try to spark his interest.

766
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,920
Just create a chance for us to meet.

767
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,160
No need to matchmake us.

768
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:19,040
Your kind gesture

769
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:21,560
will change a girl's life.

770
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:31,320
All right.

771
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:32,600
I'll find an opportunity.

772
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:34,720
Thanks!

773
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:50,240
However,

774
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:51,800
I find it strange.

775
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:53,800
Strange?

776
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:55,400
I'll just be blunt.

777
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:57,680
Generally,

778
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:00,120
grown men and women
who were childhood friends

779
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:02,080
would treat each other as family

780
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:04,000
or they wouldn't feel attracted
to each other.

781
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:06,040
But to be such good friends

782
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:08,760
so soon after a blind date,

783
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:11,240
that sounds really strange.

784
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:17,400
So do you think men and women
can never be just friends?

785
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,520
They can be,

786
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:21,080
but not too platonic.

787
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:23,200
There must be motives.

788
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:27,160
For example, you and T-Rex

789
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:31,360
may possibly know that the other person
likes someone else.

790
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:32,960
So you took a step back

791
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:35,320
and just stayed as friends first.

792
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:37,840
Or maybe you like someone else,

793
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,760
but you think he's not bad,

794
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:41,760
so you befriend him first.

795
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:44,040
These type of friends

796
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:46,040
all share a common name.

797
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:48,680
A backup.

798
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:51,120
