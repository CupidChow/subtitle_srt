1
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,080
Thank you.

2
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,160
Melon got dumped.

3
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,440
She was rejected by Yuan Song
at her birthday party last weekend.

4
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,440
Even if she's thick-skinned,
she is still a girl.

5
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:25,800
It is all your fault for saying it's easy
for a girl to pursue a guy

6
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,160
and even encouraged her to confess.

7
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,040
It is easy indeed.

8
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,840
At least it was for me.

9
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:35,280
So Cai Minmin is chasing Yuan Song?

10
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,840
No, she is obsessed with him.

11
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:41,520
And she chose your class
because Yuan Song did,

12
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,960
as a way to follow
her prince charming's footsteps.

13
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,680
What is it?

14
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,200
That's not the only reason.

15
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:51,360
Melon likes art appreciation too.

16
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,080
Yes, she likes it too.

17
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,360
I mean, that's the main factor.

18
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,880
She didn't mean to skip class.

19
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,280
-Then what did Yuan Song say?
-Nothing.

20
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,280
He has a girlfriend.

21
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,200
He just uploaded their photo.

22
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,840
YUAN SONG

23
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,400
This kid

24
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:19,320
sure knows how to keep his secret.

25
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:26,720
Cai Minmin is good at acting dumb.

26
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,600
She would always act cute around guys.

27
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:29,600
How shameless.

28
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,840
-Have you heard of Yuan Song?
-Yes.

29
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,120
He is so handsome.

30
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,760
Cai Minmin joined
the Ballroom Dance Club for him.

31
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,880
Last week she confessed her feelings
to him at her birthday party

32
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,880
and got rejected.

33
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:42,960
How embarrassing.

34
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,840
That's horrible.

35
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,240
I should have opened
the door for her that night

36
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,960
even though it was late.

37
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,200
What's the matter?

38
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,200
What happened?

39
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,440
Zhanni.

40
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:16,200
Does the whole school know
that I was rejected by Yuan Song?

41
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:20,640
Li Jing and Sun Yu are gossiping again.

42
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,240
I'll kill them.

43
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,320
Don't be so hot-tempered.

44
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:29,360
If you hurt them, we'll get demerits.

45
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,600
Why?

46
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,800
They deserve it!

47
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,760
If we beat them up
because of their big mouths,

48
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:39,360
how can we take the moral high ground
and criticize them?

49
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,480
Why should you take the moral high ground?

50
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,760
Are you stupid?

51
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,560
That's not it.

52
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:49,840
I just don't want your dad and Old Man Ye
to be called to the school for this.

53
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,840
We can't make them proud,

54
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,560
yet they still have to clean up our mess
at their age.

55
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,760
They're just jealous.

56
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,200
That's why they can only gossip
behind my back.

57
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,560
Hey.

58
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:07,080
The 330ml toner in your dorm
runs out in just a month.

59
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,840
Let them be.

60
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:12,520
They can't afford it,
so just consider that as a donation.

61
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:15,240
But they even used your meal card
and subway card,

62
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,320
and you brought them food
from home as well.

63
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,280
Just think that you fed them to the dogs.

64
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,360
No way.

65
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,640
I'll scratch their faces.

66
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,800
Ms. Liu Zhanni.

67
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,320
Calm down.

68
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:28,880
Switch to another dorm room.

69
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,400
Why should I do that?

70
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,560
Then I'll move to your room
and we'll gossip about them.

71
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,480
There's no need.

72
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,560
I forgot to tell you.

73
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,280
This is my birthday gift from Old Man Ye.

74
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,800
It's just opposite the school.

75
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:47,920
It's 40 to 50 square meters.

76
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,840
Do you want to move in with me
after it has been renovated?

77
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,880
Yes, of course. This is great!

78
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:56,240
Melon, I wish I could be
your uncle's wife.

79
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,240
Not a chance.

80
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:11,240
He Fanxing,
are you going to walk the dog or not?

81
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,080
Baylor can't wait already!

82
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,760
I'm coming!

83
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,400
Let's go.

84
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,760
-I'm going now.
-Wait a second.

85
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:30,520
Why did you put on such heavy makeup
when you're just walking the dog?

86
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,080
Is it too heavy?

87
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,040
No, not at all.

88
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,800
Go now, hurry up.
Baylor is getting anxious.

89
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,240
-Hurry up.
-Bye.

90
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,440
-Be careful!
-Let's go!

91
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,160
Come on, Baylor.

92
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,880
-Let's go.
-Goodness.

93
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,080
Are you going to a sportswear party?

94
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,240
What?

95
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,400
You look gorgeous.

96
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,440
Of course.

97
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,880
-I am going to the park.
-Do you know about Yuan Song's girlfriend?

98
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,040
Girlfriend?

99
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,560
Don't you know?

100
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,200
Didn't you see his WeChat Moments?

101
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,920
What WeChat Moments?

102
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,720
Look at that fair and delicate hand.

103
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,040
She must be someone from your office.

104
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,720
I don't know.

105
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:25,840
I have never interfered
with my staff's personal lives.

106
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,520
Are you not curious at all?

107
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:31,040
His social circle includes those
in your office.

108
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,200
People around you.

109
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,000
<i>It's me.</i>

110
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,640
He is my student.

111
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,320
Can't you care about him more?

112
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,160
<i>I am doing more than that.</i>

113
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:47,240
<i>He has gotten all my attention now.</i>

114
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,000
Forget it, you look like a ghost.

115
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:50,920
Go walk the dog.

116
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
<i>Door opened.</i>

117
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,720
<i>Door locked.</i>

118
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,720
MOMENTS

119
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,520
Let's go, Baylor.

120
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,160
You look beautiful.

121
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:33,720
Really?

122
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:36,440
I just changed into these randomly.

123
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,360
Give me your phone.

124
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,560
Are you already checking my phone?

125
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:44,960
Will you give it or not?

126
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,040
What are you deleting?

127
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,160
PLACE YOUR FINGER

128
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,760
COMPLETE

129
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:01,920
All right.

130
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,560
You are free to use my phone as you wish.

131
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:13,720
What is this?

132
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,360
Relax, our colleagues can't see it.

133
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,720
So how is He Canyang able to see this,
but not me?

134
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,600
Is he able to see this?

135
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,880
Right, he is in the school group,

136
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,400
while you are in the colleague group.

137
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,160
This photo is only visible
to the school group.

138
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,920
We're still within the internship period.
You know, right?

139
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:41,360
You want to hide it from your family,

140
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,520
friends and colleagues for now.

141
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,560
That's why

142
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,200
I only showed it to my school group.

143
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,920
A girl at school has a crush on me.

144
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,520
I don't want to give her false hope.

145
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,720
I still don't think that it's good.

146
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,280
All right.

147
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,640
I won't do it anymore, okay?

148
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:03,600
Okay.

149
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,840
Why are there so many bugs
flying around tonight?

150
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,440
Let's walk the dogs.

151
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,240
Come on, Baylor.

152
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:23,720
Let's go.

153
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,320
Let's go.

154
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,360
Luming.

155
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:47,680
If there were to be a time machine,
which year would you return to?

156
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:50,880
To year 2007

157
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,000
and invest all my money
in stocks and properties.

158
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,720
How materialistic.

159
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,200
Aren't you the same?

160
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,720
What would you do then?

161
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:10,680
My only regret is not spending time
with my son when I was younger.

162
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,920
That's why he is so rebellious now,

163
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,800
but I can't discipline him.

164
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,360
That's typically 90 percent
of Chinese men.

165
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,080
They thought kids were troublesome

166
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,840
and treated them like pets.

167
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,440
They played with them
when they felt like it

168
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,200
and scolded them
when they were not in the mood.

169
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,520
But once they have gotten old,

170
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,960
they'd complain that they're not close.

171
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,440
They're all the same.

172
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,760
You are right.

173
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,080
Your son is all grown up now.

174
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,720
It is too late to regret it now.

175
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,480
But your daughter is only eight,

176
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,320
you can still do something about it.

177
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,400
You are saying

178
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:55,760
that I should go with the flow
if my son doesn't call me.

179
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,040
If I ever move to another house,
we would just lose contact.

180
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,680
Think more positively.

181
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:04,720
When he wants to inherit your assets,
he will eventually contact you.

182
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,480
Well, thank you.

183
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,480
You too.

184
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,760
That lady of yours will give up hope
and be with you

185
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,840
once her first love fails.

186
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,520
From your mouth to God's ears.

187
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,800
But you need more alcohol
to quench your sorrows

188
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,720
over your failure as a dad.

189
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,280
Here is where you're wrong.

190
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,840
You are the one who just failed in love.

191
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:35,040
So, I should drink with you.

192
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,920
BESHEEN LIQUOR

193
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,600
Mr. Zhao, this is your coffee.

194
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,680
Mr. Ye, this is your coffee.

195
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,480
Thank you.

196
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,440
Did you drink last night?

197
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:33,360
You'd get a headache and ask for iced
Americano with extra ice after a hangover.

198
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,960
Is that a spiteful expression
on your face?

199
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:39,720
No, Mr. Ye.

200
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:41,920
I am your cousin.

201
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,800
-I'll report on personal matters then.
-Okay.

202
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,040
Your sister called in this manner again
last night.

203
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,360
I have to set you up with a woman
each week until you find someone.

204
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:56,240
I feel like a matchmaker with a radar
when I walk around now,

205
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,600
always searching for
my boss's future wife.

206
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,200
Forget it.

207
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,280
I am just an assistant.

208
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:06,400
-I'm stuck between you two. I really--
-I told you, forget it.

209
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,160
The previous date went well
and I found a girl I like.

210
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:13,000
-Mr. Ye, it's done. Please take a look.
-Okay.

211
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,680
What do you think?

212
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,320
-Okay.
-Okay?

213
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,440
Oh my goodness.

214
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,320
This color is nice.

215
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,400
Thank you.

216
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,440
You have always complimented my lip color,

217
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,800
so I bought one for you this time.

218
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:36,320
If you ever quit marketing,
you can be a beauty blogger.

219
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,080
I still have a long way to go on that one.

220
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,200
By the way,

221
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,080
I have something for you too.

222
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,040
A yearly gym membership,
just one station away from your house.

223
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:51,240
Is this the one that just opened
last month?

224
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,560
-Yes.
-I did call and inquire about it.

225
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,520
Their yoga instructor is from India.

226
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,360
The annual fee is very expensive.

227
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:01,560
I thought of becoming a member
when I get my pay next month.

228
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,720
The business that guarantees a profit
is self-investment.

229
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,680
Exactly, I totally agree.

230
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,720
We have to improve ourselves
to meet our better half.

231
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:13,760
But...

232
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,600
it is too expensive.

233
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:19,120
Don't worry, I didn't spend any money.

234
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,840
This gym is our new client, so it's free.

235
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,920
Your company is really nice,

236
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,720
I want to work there too.

237
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,800
In that case,

238
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,080
I will accept it.

239
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:31,720
Thank you, Su Li.

240
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,720
All the gym members here

241
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,200
must have a high salary.

242
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,720
They work out because they are ambitious
and have high expectations of themselves.

243
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,200
Therefore,

244
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,640
to me, this gym is

245
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,200
like a matchmaking agency.

246
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,720
When I introduced my cousin to you,

247
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:53,320
you were seeing a florist, right?

248
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,120
Don't mention him.

249
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,400
He's a scumbag.

250
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,800
I am really unlucky.

251
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:04,000
If I knew that florist is a scumbag,

252
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:07,080
I would have been the one to go on
a blind date with your cousin.

253
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:08,680
Yes.

254
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:12,120
You might not like my cousin.

255
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,720
He is quite childish at times.

256
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:14,920
Is that so?

257
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,400
To be frank,

258
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:20,400
I didn't expect him to be so handsome.

259
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,680
He doesn't look like he is turning 40.

260
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,360
Have you seen my cousin?

261
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,680
Yes, by chance.

262
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:29,160
He is a perfect match for my colleague.

263
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,160
They even ate ice-cream together.

264
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,360
Are they moving that fast?

265
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:37,800
Actually,

266
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:40,600
I had never expected
for you two to hit it off.

267
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,520
He may meet your expectations

268
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:46,080
of being rich, successful
and good-looking.

269
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:47,720
However,

270
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:50,120
in love, you would never know.

271
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,240
Blind dates depend on luck.

272
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,400
Please tell me his flaws,

273
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,880
or I will be very regretful.

274
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,920
Well, there are many of them.

275
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:04,880
In fact, I have talked badly about him
to you before.

276
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,080
Don't be mad, all right?

277
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:11,680
Actually, my cousin is the T-Rex
that I always refer to.

278
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:12,680
My boss.

279
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:16,240
I didn't tell you before,
so you won't be prejudiced towards him.

280
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,280
Is your cousin the T-Rex?

281
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,400
Do you feel better now?

282
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,480
What kind of flaw is that?

283
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:23,840
I don't work for him.

284
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:26,480
All right.

285
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,040
This is fate.

286
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:31,200
He is a T-Rex, even an ordinary
animal trainer can't subdue a T-Rex.

287
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,280
You have to be
a really good dragon trainer.

288
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:35,920
I know.

289
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,560
I don't have that kind of luck.

290
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,280
That's enough.

291
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,800
Rich guys with good physiques

292
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:46,120
are waiting for you at the gym.

293
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,920
Right, happiness awaits at the next stop.

294
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,200
I can do this.

295
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:54,560
I went to that speed dating event
with Cong Xiao

296
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,640
and became friends with one of the guys
working in sales.

297
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,080
When I kept asking him, he told me

298
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,720
that the florist
would always go to such events.

299
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,440
His ideal girl is

300
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:06,760
pretty, independent,
and doesn't care about money.

301
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,280
So he is seeing many girls.

302
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:12,160
Does he think he is a king who can
take his pick just because he's rich?

303
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,160
Cong Xiao is so pitiful.

304
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,200
She must be very sad lately.

305
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:17,960
We can't even see her

306
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,520
because she's so busy with company events.

307
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,880
Why don't we go for karaoke
tomorrow night?

308
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:25,240
Let's show her that we care.

309
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:26,480
That's great.

310
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,920
It has been ages
since I last went out at night.

311
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,680
My mom is strict,

312
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,160
but it should be okay
if it is a company activity.

313
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:39,840
What's the matter?

314
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,240
Ms. He,

315
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:46,320
can we use the activity fund
for this group activity?

316
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,400
Why should we use the fund
for such a small activity?

317
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:53,720
It's on me.

318
00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:00,520
How can we let you spend money on us?

319
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:01,440
That's right.

320
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:02,840
Don't give me that.

321
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,240
What are you talking about?

322
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,840
Can a man join you?

323
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:10,440
Of course, only because you're handsome.

324
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,760
As long as you are not scared
to be sitting beside Ms. He.

325
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,640
Don't create an issue.

326
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,200
Ms. He is very nice to me.

327
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,240
You seem to be coming to work
on time recently.

328
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,360
Keep it up.

329
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:25,360
Hey!

330
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,960
Yuan Song, how is it possible
for you to get a drumstick?

331
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,840
Didn't they say that it was sold out?

332
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,000
Yes.

333
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,600
Drumsticks are so popular here.

334
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:35,280
We would always come really early
just to get it.

335
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,200
That's right.

336
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:38,880
But I get it every time.

337
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,160
That's impossible.

338
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:45,120
Unless someone is saving it for you.

339
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,920
It's so good to be handsome.

340
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,160
You get special treatment
even for your meals.

341
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,720
That's right.

342
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:01,680
Look at Yuan Song's stir-fry meat
with green pepper.

343
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,480
He has more meat than green peppers,
and look at ours.

344
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:06,840
There are only peppers.

345
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,160
The meat has run away.

346
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:10,920
Exactly.

347
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,360
Here, take it.

348
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:23,120
You are good at sucking up
to your superior.

349
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,120
However,

350
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,360
Ms. He is just and stern.

351
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,480
Bribery doesn't work.

352
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,040
Am I that obvious?

353
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,280
Yes, you are totally up to something.

354
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,680
Learn from him. You are of the same age.

355
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,640
I'm doing okay.

356
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,560
I'm an official employee here.

357
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,520
I guess you are not aware of it.

358
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:44,520
Our company requires the receptionist
to be a little silly.

359
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,720
Ms. Bai, you're teasing me again!

360
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:48,720
Who says so?

361
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,200
-Why are you taking my food?
-Ms. He.

362
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,400
I want to go to school this afternoon.

363
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,560
Can you let me take leave?

364
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:58,400
Sure.

365
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,800
That's it for today.

366
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:08,760
Search for Van Gogh's works
from different periods.

367
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:11,000
Also, Cai...

368
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,880
Did Cai Minmin just run away?

369
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:32,840
What did you do to her?

370
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,480
Are you two close?

371
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,640
I recruited her to the club.

372
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,720
She is my dance partner.

373
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,080
I heard she confessed her feelings to you.

374
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,440
Sort of.

375
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,600
But she is just a kid.

376
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,200
I have no feelings for her.

377
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:51,000
Then who is the girl
who held hands with you?

378
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,200
You never told me about her.

379
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,800
If we're still together
after three months,

380
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,520
I'll introduce you to her.

381
00:21:58,960 --> 00:21:59,800
I understand.

382
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,160
I have done the same.

383
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:02,720
What?

384
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,680
The best way to reject a girl
is to say that you have a girlfriend.

385
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,720
It doesn't matter if it is true or not.

386
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,320
Don't I know you well enough?

387
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:15,160
I'll surely know when you fall
for someone in school or at work.

388
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,240
Whatever you say.

389
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,440
But...

390
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,240
Cai Minmin may not be a simple girl.

391
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:25,680
Don't underestimate women

392
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,800
or you will suffer.

393
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:29,320
What do you mean?

394
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,400
That's all I can say.

395
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:33,880
As a professor, I won't meddle
with my students' personal lives.

396
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:45,240
<i>I have resigned!</i>

397
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,480
I HAVE RESIGNED!

398
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,400
<i>Did Shen Fanfan agree?</i>

399
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:59,320
<i>I already had a serious talk with him.</i>

400
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:01,240
<i>Now he knows that, as a dad,</i>

401
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:03,640
<i>he should support the family.</i>

402
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,400
<i>He must be unhappy about it.</i>

403
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:21,320
<i>Maybe he's afraid that Yang Xiaoyu
would beat him up.</i>

404
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,000
<i>Goodness.</i>

405
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,160
<i>Our pet dog has spoken!</i>

406
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:31,760
<i>Regardless,</i>

407
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:35,120
<i>Xiaoyu has taken her first step
in becoming a housewife.</i>

408
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:38,440
<i>There are 9,999 more steps to go.</i>

409
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:42,760
<i>The moment I walked out of
the manager's office after I resigned,</i>

410
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,480
<i>I suddenly had doubts</i>

411
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:47,680
<i>if I have made the right choice.</i>

412
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,880
<i>What if it's a wrong decision?</i>

413
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:53,960
<i>There's nothing guaranteed in this world,</i>

414
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:56,080
<i>including absolutely right choices.</i>

415
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:01,800
<i>But if you live your life the way
you mocked me since we were young,</i>

416
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,840
<i>there's nothing you can't surpass.</i>

417
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,400
Mom!

418
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,360
-Come out now!
-Peanut.

419
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,960
I'm pooping.

420
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,200
Go to your dad.

421
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,120
<i>Why is He Fanxing so quiet?</i>

422
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:14,640
<i>Is she showering?</i>

423
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,040
<i>She's not home yet.</i>

424
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,000
<i>She is out for a movie with her colleague.</i>

425
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:21,680
<i>Now, the only time I have
to contemplate about life is</i>

426
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,800
<i>when I am in the toilet.</i>

427
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,000
<i>Being single is better.</i>

428
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:29,040
<i>You can go shopping
or watch a movie after work.</i>

429
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,880
<i>There isn't any nice movie showing now.</i>

430
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:35,280
<i>We're all chatting,
why is she ignoring us?</i>

431
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,000
<i>I wasn't.</i>

432
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:38,720
<i>I was just thinking</i>

433
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,400
<i>that it doesn't matter</i>

434
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,680
<i>whether Xiaoyu
made the right choice or not.</i>

435
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:46,400
<i>It's good if you've made the right choice,
but if it happens to be a wrong one,</i>

436
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,360
<i>you can bear the consequences.</i>

437
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:53,280
<i>We will always support you
no matter what happens.</i>

438
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,320
Mom,

439
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,760
Dad is playing video games.

440
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:04,440
I will be right out, Peanut.

441
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,200
Shen Fanfan,

442
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,880
can you please take care of your daughter?

443
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:10,840
Okay.

444
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,600
Aren't you done yet?

445
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:19,080
Try having constipation
during pregnancy, okay?

446
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:20,960
Fine.

447
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,000
Peanut, come here.

448
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,520
<i>Just watch your movie.</i>

449
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:27,240
<i>Why are you suddenly so sentimental?</i>

450
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,720
<i>You make educators like me and He Canyang</i>

451
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:32,760
<i>look stupid for not knowing
how to comfort people.</i>

452
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,280
<i>Isn't it He Fanxing's style</i>

453
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:37,040
<i>to act like Sailormoon disguised
as a school disciplinarian</i>

454
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,320
<i>to summon courage for the whole world?</i>

455
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,840
<i>No, I am not summoning courage.</i>

456
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,400
<i>I am courage itself.</i>

457
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:57,400
You're here.

458
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,400
<i>Bye, movie time.</i>

459
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:00,320
WEATHER GROUP

460
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,200
What are you doing?

461
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:08,480
This cinema is far,
so we won't run into anyone.

462
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:11,120
Wearing sunglasses at night
attracts more attention.

463
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,080
What do you know?

464
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,280
This is a small world.

465
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,920
You're more likely to run into someone
you know when you don't want to

466
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,400
and vice versa.

467
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,520
I'll get the tickets.

468
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,440
Wait.

469
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,040
I have already bought them.

470
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,160
I'll get water and popcorn.

471
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:32,640
We still have around ten minutes
before the movie starts.

472
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:33,680
Let's talk.

473
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,200
Here.

474
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:43,720
What is this?

475
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,480
AGREEMENT

476
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,880
We agreed not to go public
for three months.

477
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,400
So you need to be really careful.

478
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:56,840
In case the boundaries are unclear,

479
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,440
I've made an agreement.

480
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,640
Let me know if you have any objections.

481
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,200
We will revise it as necessary.

482
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:12,520
"First, stay at least 20cm away
from each other in public."

483
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:16,320
We must avoid meeting people we know.

484
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:20,160
When there's no one around,
only then we can relax.

485
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,120
No objections, right?

486
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:26,840
"Second, behaviors or conversations
that cross the line

487
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:29,920
of our professional relationship
are strictly prohibited in the office."

488
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,960
Like giving me the drumstick today
at the canteen.

489
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:34,760
That was so inappropriate.

490
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:38,640
Bai and Qingqing only thought
that you were sucking up on me,

491
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,640
but there are perceptive colleagues.

492
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:41,960
For example, Cong Xiao.

493
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,120
She is very observant.

494
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:50,280
"Third, don't upload photos
on social media."

495
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,920
I thought about this carefully.

496
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,520
You can post on social media,
as long as there's no photo.

497
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:01,520
Your posts are only seen
by people from your school,

498
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:05,800
but there are two people at your school
who know me very well.

499
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:09,480
One is the Sociology expert,
Assistant Professor Song Xue.

500
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:12,120
She has been my best friend
since high school

501
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,960
and needless to say, He Canyang.

502
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:18,080
He didn't observe the hand closely.

503
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:20,880
Or else, he would have recognized my arm.

504
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,760
Only three? Is there anything else?

505
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:28,440
No.

506
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:31,640
Read it and tell me
if you have any objections.

507
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:33,240
We can revise it.

508
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:34,600
I have no objections.

509
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,360
Well, you are the administrative director.

510
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:38,520
You're good at setting guidelines,
so I'm fine with it.

511
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:40,520
Let's go in now.

512
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:41,840
Wait.

513
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,360
Are you perhaps angry?

514
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,040
No, let's go.

515
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:57,600
<i>Who's that?</i>

516
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,200
<i>Who's that?</i>

517
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:05,920
<i>Watching a movie on the first date</i>

518
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:08,440
<i>is a conservative and safe choice.</i>

519
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,240
<i>We won't feel awkward</i>

520
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,200
<i>and can get closer at the same time.</i>

521
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:15,360
<i>And the best tool that can help
progress our relationship is</i>

522
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,280
<i>popcorn.</i>

523
00:29:57,560 --> 00:30:00,440
<i>It's okay if he doesn't like popcorn.</i>

524
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:03,160
<i>Choosing the right movie is the key.</i>

525
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:08,320
<i>Horror movies can naturally help us
get more intimate.</i>

526
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,200
<i>As we are on a date,</i>

527
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:14,120
<i>we both know very well
why we chose to watch horror movie.</i>

528
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:45,840
<i>Yes, act natural.</i>

529
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,080
<i>During scary scenes,</i>

530
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,920
<i>cling to him naturally.</i>

531
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,480
<i>Life is like a movie.
It is all about acting.</i>

532
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,000
<i>You can do it, Ms. He!</i>

533
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,040
<i>What is this?</i>

534
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,200
<i>It's not even scary.</i>

535
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:08,120
<i>There's only sound effects
and there are no ghosts.</i>

536
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:17,920
<i>Crap, I missed the opportunity!</i>

537
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,240
<i>Calm down...</i>

538
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:22,240
<i>There are plenty of opportunities.</i>

539
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,320
<i>Seize the scary moment.</i>

540
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:43,240
I'm sorry.

541
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:18,280
It was really scary
when the ghost appeared earlier.

542
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:19,640
You're so silly.

543
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:20,640
I have already told you.

544
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,160
It might turn out to be a fake ghost.

545
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:23,760
But it was still scary.

546
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:26,560
Whenever you feel scared,
I will protect you.

547
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:34,360
<i>Why did we talk about the agreement
before the movie?</i>

548
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,560
<i>Why in the world did I do that?</i>

549
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,160
It's no wonder that Professor He said

550
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,080
you're not afraid of horror movies.

551
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,240
I didn't believe him before.

552
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,680
Did He Canyang say that?

553
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:51,640
He said that you love watching
horror movies with him.

554
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,960
Especially old Hong Kong horror movies,

555
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:56,920
like the <i>Haunted Office</i>
and <i>Troublesome Night</i> film series.

556
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,880
<i>Good thing I didn't cling to him earlier.</i>

557
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,400
I saw other girls

558
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:07,640
hugging their boyfriends or husbands.

559
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:09,400
Then when I looked at my girlfriend...

560
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,880
She is totally different. How unique.

561
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,240
That's the girl I love.

562
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:24,560
Actually, I was planning to hold your hand
while watching the movie

563
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:28,320
and throw myself
into your arms like I was scared,

564
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,440
and kiss you.

565
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,480
I will wait until after
the agreed three months then.

566
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,120
Hello.

567
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:48,600
Now?

568
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:54,480
We were supposed to have the meeting
tomorrow to discuss and revise the plan,

569
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,920
but the owner is suddenly going
on a business trip for a month.

570
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:58,560
He wants to see me now.

571
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:00,560
It's okay.

572
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:01,880
It's about time to go home anyway.

573
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,800
-I'll get going.
-He Fanxing.

574
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:05,600
Yes?

575
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:24,960
It tastes good.

576
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:26,880
Hey.

577
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:27,840
What were you expecting?

578
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:29,120
We're in public.

579
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:32,680
Nothing.

580
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,280
I'm leaving.

581
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,160
<i>The feeling of falling in love</i>

582
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,880
<i>for the first time is like</i>

583
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:57,760
<i>having a rabbit trapped in my chest.</i>

584
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:00,600
<i>It's like waves under calm water,</i>

585
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,760
<i>a roaring roller coaster,</i>

586
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:07,880
<i>orange soda in summer and a starry sky!</i>

587
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,880
YE LUMING

588
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,320
Hello.

589
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,600
<i>Hello, He Fanxing.</i>

590
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:19,920
<i>Are you home now?</i>

591
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:23,960
I am on my way home,
but I'll arrive in about ten minutes.

592
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,400
-Why?
-<i>Help me!</i>

593
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,360
<i>Love Charm has eaten a gauze.</i>

594
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,040
<i>Can you come over and help me?</i>

595
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:31,880
-Did you call the vet?
-<i>I did.</i>

596
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:35,040
<i>He told me to stay calm
as he would excrete it,</i>

597
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:37,840
<i>but he is jumping around
as if it is very painful.</i>

598
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:39,800
<i>I am really worried.</i>

599
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,240
<i>You are my only friend with a pet dog.</i>

600
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,800
<i>I can only ask for your help.</i>

601
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,040
Okay, send me your home address then.

602
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:46,800
-<i>Okay, I'll send it now.</i>
-Okay.

603
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:58,480
Are you sure he ate the gauze?

604
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:00,960
The gauze was on the table,

605
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,680
but it was suddenly gone.

606
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,640
He usually eats random things,

607
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:07,600
but the gauze...

608
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,280
He...

609
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:14,120
But according to my experience,

610
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:17,520
it doesn't seem like he had eaten a gauze.

611
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:19,480
Yes.

612
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:20,480
I...

613
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:21,920
gradually...

614
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:22,920
noticed that...

615
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:25,080
as well.

616
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,320
I think...

617
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:32,800
Love Charm is in heat.

618
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:36,520
After some time,
he will pee and bark randomly.

619
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,640
If you don't plan
on finding a female dog for him,

620
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:41,640
I would suggest you

621
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,800
to give him a KC.

622
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:46,680
"KC"?

623
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:49,960
Neuter him and save all the troubles.

624
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,240
I have to think about it.

625
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,240
This is common for dogs.

626
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,560
Don't worry.

627
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:58,880
Really?

628
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:02,600
My Baylor loves to hide things.

629
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:06,520
He always drags my clothes
to his hiding place.

630
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:10,280
Also, he would hide toys and tiny stuff
under the sofa.

631
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,280
Is that so?

632
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:16,080
It's no wonder that my things
always go missing.

633
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:19,280
But I think that in your house,

634
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,680
this sofa is the only place
to hide things.

635
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:23,640
Is that so?

636
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,320
I can see something.

637
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,640
See, that's the gauze.

638
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,520
I have to tell the maid to clean
under the sofa.

639
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:35,920
Are you going to keep the hairband?

640
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:37,960
You should throw it away.

641
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:41,240
This belongs to my niece.

642
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:44,360
Well, her university is around here.

643
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,560
She always comes over during the weekends.

644
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:51,680
I won't throw it away.

645
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,040
It's really my niece's.

646
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:56,840
Don't you believe me?

647
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:58,560
I do.

648
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,680
Why would you lie to me?

649
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:06,920
Won't you clean this up?

650
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,760
I'll let the maid do it.

651
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,280
Have a seat.

652
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:12,720
I'll get you some tea.

653
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:21,640
I am sorry for asking you to come here.

654
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:25,000
As long as Love Charm is fine.

655
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,160
-Here.
-Thank you.

656
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,760
I understand how you felt.

657
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,920
Back then, my brother
brought Baylor back from a pet shop.

658
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,520
He had a crush on a girl

659
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,240
who loves dogs,

660
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:42,840
so he bought a dog just to hit on her.

661
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:45,560
My parents scolded him.

662
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:48,600
They were against it
and wanted him to return the dog.

663
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:50,800
I know how your parents felt.

664
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:53,760
After my sister gave Love Charm to me
as a birthday gift,

665
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:55,680
I wish I never celebrated
my birthday again.

666
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:01,520
But my parents were only against it
in words.

667
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:04,080
They are actually the ones
closest to Baylor.

668
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:07,720
When Baylor returned from the vet

669
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:10,520
after an injection for his stomach flu,

670
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,840
both of them couldn't sleep.

671
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:15,200
They kept checking on him at night.

672
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,760
In fact, Baylor is also the closest
to them now.

673
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:21,320
When my mom goes grocery shopping,

674
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:24,040
he will help her hold things
with his mouth.

675
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:27,600
Whenever my dad is exercising,
he will guard him.

676
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:33,280
On a certain level,
having a dog is better than a son.

677
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:37,200
That's exactly what my dad said.

678
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,600
By the way, we kept talking about dogs.

679
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:51,640
I forgot to ask you.

680
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:54,200
You look really happy tonight.

681
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,040
Were you on a date?

682
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:59,240
Yes.

683
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,200
We watched a movie.

684
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:06,280
But I wonder...

685
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:10,040
if I have ruined the date.

686
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:12,160
Anyhow, it still ended well.

687
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:15,160
I really shouldn't be too blunt.

688
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,240
I don't know

689
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,640
what exactly happened,

690
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:22,080
but I think it's good to speak frankly.

691
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:24,880
New couples usually try

692
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:28,440
to show their good sides
and hide their shortcomings.

693
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:34,040
Though this is understandable,
I don't think it's wise.

694
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:36,920
The key to a long-lasting relationship is

695
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:40,000
the acceptance
of each other's shortcomings

696
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,800
and not each other's good qualities.

697
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:54,120
What's with that look?

698
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:56,200
Do you...

699
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:59,040
really consider me a close friend?

700
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:02,760
Of course.

701
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:06,720
Why would I let my business partner's
staff come to my house?

702
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:11,960
Actually, I have been wanting
to ask you a question,

703
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:15,160
but it might come off as rude.

704
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:18,040
Since you consider me a close friend,

705
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:19,600
I will go ahead and ask.

706
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:21,560
No problem.

707
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:26,240
You know so much about love

708
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,880
and relationships.

709
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:30,360
And you are good looking,

710
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:31,840
rich,

711
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:34,000
and brilliant with ideas
on how to approach love.

712
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:38,360
Why can't you get the girl you like?

713
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:00,640
