1
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,240
The problem between the two of you

2
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,720
is that you're only giving her
a sense of belonging,

3
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,360
not a sense of security.

4
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,120
Isn't the sense of security
the foundation for a sense of belonging?

5
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:15,480
A sense of belonging is, "I am yours."

6
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:18,680
But a sense of security is,
"You are mine."

7
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,840
These are two opposite feelings.

8
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:23,960
I see.

9
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,920
Likewise, you only found
a sense of belonging.

10
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,280
Yes.

11
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,280
I belong to her.

12
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,280
I want her to be happy.

13
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,080
I want to become a capable man.

14
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,040
That has always been my goal.

15
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,000
But looks like we both feel insecure.

16
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,640
Kid,

17
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:49,000
a sense of security is not necessarily
a good thing in a relationship.

18
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,960
When we feel secure,
we tend to neglect our partner.

19
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,880
We are no longer romantic
and we become complacent.

20
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,920
She will be assured
that you will never leave

21
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,440
and won't put in much effort.

22
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Look at those married couples,

23
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,880
giving each other 520 yuan as gifts
on their anniversary

24
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,320
and posting on social media.

25
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,720
The money will end up being saved

26
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,240
as an educational fund for their children.

27
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,640
I haven't thought about this.

28
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,160
That's normal because
it's something in your distant future.

29
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,720
The most pressing matter is for you two

30
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,480
to establish a sense of security.

31
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,400
Because we're insecure,

32
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,840
we tend to keep it to ourselves
whenever problems arise.

33
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,960
We are wary and afraid
of discussing those issues.

34
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,200
Perhaps the problem lies with me.

35
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:45,160
When problems arise in a relationship,

36
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,760
it's not just one person's fault.

37
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,240
I still have to deal with mine first.

38
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,000
Meiyin,

39
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,960
I won't study abroad anymore.

40
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,120
I can't leave her.

41
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,360
So I'm staying.

42
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,280
I knew it.

43
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,200
Love is everything.

44
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,400
Be gentle.

45
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,280
Your shoulders are stiffer than Mom's.

46
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,160
Don't you dare mention
"old" and "mom" in front of me today.

47
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:25,640
Is it better?

48
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:33,840
Yes!

49
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:36,880
It feels so much better.

50
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,080
Why did you buy an evening gown?

51
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,600
Is a colleague getting married?

52
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,320
Whatever you say.

53
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,200
"Whatever you say."

54
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,040
Look.

55
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,160
What?

56
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,360
That's Yuan Song's ex.

57
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,360
<i>About 300 to 360 kilograms?</i>

58
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,480
The one I told you, who refused
to break up and was really clingy.

59
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,360
Then what about Wu Meiyin?

60
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,280
Wu Meiyin?

61
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,720
<i>Our food is definitely safe.</i>

62
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,400
<i>Look at the size of our shop.</i>

63
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:29,000
<i>The SAIC and MOH have checked us.</i>

64
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,840
<i>So we can guarantee that it's very safe.</i>

65
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,240
<i>For the past 30 years...</i>

66
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,720
<i>Why won't you tell me?</i>

67
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,120
<i>Don't you have faith in me?</i>

68
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,880
<i>-How long will you like me?
-How long will you like me?</i>

69
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,320
<i>Can we just...</i>

70
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,880
<i>stay in this moment forever?</i>

71
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,000
<i>Am I really included</i>

72
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,560
<i>in your future?</i>

73
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,600
Thank God!

74
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,160
You're finally here, Yuan Song.

75
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,840
What happened to your partner?

76
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,760
Forget it, he's dating a girl,

77
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,720
and she won't let him dance with me.

78
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,240
She would break up with him
if he held another girl's hand.

79
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,880
The show is tonight.

80
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,720
I can only ask for your help.

81
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,480
Fine, let's rehearse then.

82
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,480
What's the song?

83
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,720
"Come Dance With Me".

84
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:14,280
<i>What is wrong with you, He Fanxing?</i>

85
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,160
<i>Why won't you answer my calls?</i>

86
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,560
<i>Buy me dinner.</i>

87
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,360
<i>Why aren't you replying? Are you busy?</i>

88
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,920
<i>He Fanxing, is your hand broken?</i>

89
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,440
<i>Should I visit you at the hospital?</i>

90
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,440
<i>Why aren't you answering your phone?
Are you okay?</i>

91
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,600
<i>It's because I need some time.</i>

92
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,520
RESIGNATION CERTIFICATE

93
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:52,040
<i>No matter how difficult the task may be,</i>

94
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,480
<i>time will let me know</i>

95
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,960
<i>that it is time to clear things up.</i>

96
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,400
<i>That it is time</i>

97
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:05,080
<i>to make a decision.</i>

98
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,960
Okay, sure. Thank you.

99
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,920
Just call me if you need help.

100
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,240
Okay, bye.

101
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,360
What's up with you lately?

102
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,920
You have been avoiding me
and acting strange.

103
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,200
Did I offend you?

104
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,560
Are you asking me to apologize?

105
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,720
If you cannot give me a good reason,

106
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,320
then you need to apologize.

107
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,560
Fine.

108
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,320
Then tell me the truth.

109
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,800
What is up with you and Ye Luming?

110
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,040
We're friends.

111
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:11,320
Why did you take him to your gathering
and tell others that he's your boyfriend?

112
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,880
How did you know?

113
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,000
Your classmate, Amy told me.

114
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,640
Yuan Song was there.

115
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,480
We can't both be wrong about this.

116
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,800
Are you saying
that it's a misunderstanding?

117
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,640
No.

118
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:31,520
I knew it.

119
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:35,920
Friendship between men and women
is just an excuse to keep flirting.

120
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,960
Aren't you and Chang Huan friends?

121
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,480
Yes, but he likes me!

122
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:45,400
If you two have that kind of relationship,

123
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,360
you should have rejected me.

124
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,480
You shouldn't just say
that he likes someone else

125
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,560
and let me believe that she's a stranger.

126
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,680
I thought I had a chance.

127
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,320
Regarding this,

128
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,400
I would like to apologize to you.

129
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:05,440
But I really thought
that he liked someone else.

130
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,440
I only found out the truth recently.

131
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,640
It doesn't matter when you found out.

132
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,440
You should have told me immediately

133
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:17,680
instead of letting me act like a fool
around you two.

134
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,240
You're outrageous.

135
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,280
-Chang Huan.
-Yes?

136
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,760
How much time do you need?

137
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,760
Should I go and get a table first?

138
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,480
No, I'm nearly done.

139
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,520
Give me ten minutes.

140
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,200
Okay, I'll pack up my stuff first.

141
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,240
Okay.

142
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,040
Looks like it's going very well.

143
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,080
-I'll leave first.
-All right.

144
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,320
-Bye.
-Bye.

145
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:43,600
Hello?

146
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,040
Okay, I'll be right there.

147
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,440
I'll go get my dress from my uncle.

148
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,000
Let me see.

149
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,680
Yes, this is the dress
from your advertising shoot.

150
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,040
I love it so much.

151
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,440
Thank you, Uncle.

152
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,280
Don't you have other dresses?
Why do you want this?

153
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,720
It's not the same.

154
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:12,560
My dream guy and I
will do the opening dance,

155
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,360
and his girlfriend will be here too.

156
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:18,520
I may not be as beautiful as she is,
but at least I'll look nice.

157
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,000
What?

158
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,600
Is your masquerade open
to the public as well?

159
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:25,400
Of course, many are bringing along
their boyfriends and girlfriends.

160
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,800
Ladies get in for free,
but men will be charged 200 yuan.

161
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,680
Why don't you stay and have fun too?

162
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,520
You have never seen me dance, right?

163
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:35,760
All right.

164
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,720
Where's your girlfriend?

165
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,840
I can't tell from those masks,

166
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:33,000
but she's wearing a red dress today.

167
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,920
Then she'll be your red rose tonight

168
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,040
and I'll be your moonlight.

169
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,760
Dream on.

170
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:52,280
A big shout-out to the handsome dancers
of the Pop Dance Club.

171
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:55,080
Now let's welcome the Ballroom Dance Club

172
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:58,000
to perform a lovely waltz for us.

173
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,720
The song is "Come Dance With Me".

174
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,360
Please give them a round of applause.

175
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,280
Why are you here?

176
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,720
Okay, you can let go now.

177
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,240
You're good.

178
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:59,720
You dare to ignore my calls.

179
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,640
I didn't know what to say.

180
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,520
What's wrong?

181
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,400
Did you two have a fight?

182
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:15,560
I understand that you're upset
and you don't want to talk to anyone.

183
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:18,600
But if you're unhappy, you can talk to me.

184
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,120
I am your love guru.

185
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,880
-Love guru?
-Yes.

186
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,480
Look, you can't do this again

187
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,840
or our friendship is over.

188
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,520
Over?

189
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,440
You wouldn't do that for real.

190
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:34,760
Why not?

191
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,320
Don't you have someone you like?

192
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,720
Show me her photo.

193
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:53,480
Don't bother.

194
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,360
You don't have one

195
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,360
because she never existed.

196
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,600
From the very beginning,

197
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,400
you tried very hard to give me gifts.

198
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,440
I thought you were someone's backup.

199
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,160
This is for you.

200
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,760
Thanks for taking care of Love Charm.

201
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:20,080
If I, Ye Luming,
take He Fanxing as a backup,

202
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,320
I won't get my dream goddess!

203
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,920
Exactly, I was never your backup.

204
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,600
Because you like me.

205
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,640
But I only take you as a friend.

206
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,640
The other couples are all lovey-dovey.

207
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,280
A backup like me is standing before her,

208
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,680
but she doesn't notice me.

209
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:42,040
I'm starting to wonder
if I am unattractive.

210
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,000
Why isn't she attracted

211
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,800
no matter what I do?

212
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,800
You're not unattractive.

213
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,600
Let me dissect it for you.

214
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,560
Right now, your goddess

215
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,280
only has eyes

216
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,000
for her boyfriend.

217
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,440
"There are millions of people,

218
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,960
but I only have eyes for you."

219
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,360
Do you know why is that so?

220
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:07,040
Are you saying that he's her true love
and I should give up?

221
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,599
I mean,

222
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:11,079
there's only space for one man
in her eyes.

223
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:12,680
From that perspective,

224
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,920
that girl is pretty commendable.

225
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:16,280
At least,

226
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:18,200
she doesn't treat you like a backup.

227
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,119
I mean, she could always
keep you hanging around

228
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,520
until the time comes.

229
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:26,280
So when will she be done with him?

230
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,960
<i>I'm a very nice backup!</i>

231
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,720
You've been trying to pursue me.

232
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:42,840
You finally realize.

233
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,440
I really thought you were my friend.

234
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,640
So I believed every word you said.

235
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,680
If it wasn't for my best friend,

236
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,360
I wouldn't have thought of...

237
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:54,840
other possibilities.

238
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:59,960
People only spend time
with the person they like.

239
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,080
If you really liked someone else,

240
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,720
you wouldn't have spent
all your time with your friend.

241
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,240
Unless...

242
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,560
the person you like is her.

243
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:15,880
The girl that you claimed to like
is only your excuse.

244
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,320
Still, it's unrequited love.

245
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,680
Isn't the rejected one more pitiful?

246
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,600
Why does it sound as if

247
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:30,040
the recipient of the love
is the victim instead?

248
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,360
Am I not a victim too?

249
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,920
I blatantly declared to everyone
that we are just friends,

250
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,480
and now I'm a jerk.

251
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:40,360
Even I myself think that I am a bitch.

252
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,920
Then what should I do?

253
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,240
I like you, but you have a boyfriend.

254
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,800
What can I do besides being your friend?

255
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,160
I don't care what you do.

256
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,560
But you shouldn't have lied to me.

257
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,040
I was just hiding the truth from you.

258
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,800
You can't say that I lied to you.

259
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,320
I fell in love with you.

260
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,360
Is that such a great sin?

261
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,800
That's not the point.

262
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,920
I know. It's not wrong to like me,

263
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,560
but you lied to me.

264
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,720
I really can't accept this.

265
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:18,280
All right, so you believe
that I lied to you.

266
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:20,440
Now what? Do we stop being friends?

267
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:23,480
Okay, let's do that since you've said it.

268
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:24,840
It's over and done with.

269
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,440
You've planned this all along,
haven't you?

270
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,280
I don't care what you think.

271
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,080
I'm not in the mood to deal with you now.

272
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,000
Deal with me?

273
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,360
You'll never have to deal with me.

274
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:10,960
YUAN SONG

275
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,280
-Hello.
-Where are you?

276
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,280
You didn't reply to my message
and I couldn't find you.

277
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:24,040
I went out for some fresh air.
I'll be right back.

278
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,120
Okay.

279
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:43,480
I thought you had gotten bored and left.

280
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,320
Why would I?

281
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,920
We can hold hands
with the masks on, right?

282
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,920
No one can recognize us anyway.

283
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,800
Are we going to dance?

284
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,320
We will after the confession event.

285
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:00,480
You prefer to sit
next to the aisle in the library.

286
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:04,680
You like to go to the fifth counter
of the first canteen

287
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,600
because that lady gives you more food.

288
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:12,720
You also like playing MOBA games.

289
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,480
You have reached the elite level
of 20 badges

290
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:16,960
and you're a part-time game booster.

291
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:21,440
Although you know nothing about me,

292
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:22,960
I know you very well.

293
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,400
It's because I'm a fool who loves you.

294
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:32,080
If you know that I am the ally
who teams up with you

295
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,720
every day in the game,

296
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,840
can you come onto the stage?

297
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:39,240
I would like to ask you out, Zuo Yang!

298
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,040
Today,

299
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,040
I finally have a girlfriend!

300
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,160
And...

301
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:56,520
the best thing is that
she will let me play my games.

302
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,160
This is great!

303
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:01,600
-Congratulations!
-Congratulations!

304
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,920
Congratulations to number 36
on a successful love confession!

305
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,520
Yuan Song.

306
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:13,600
Can we step outside?
I have something to say.

307
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:14,760
Wait a minute,

308
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,920
I have something to say too.

309
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,680
-The next person is...
-That's good.

310
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:22,360
-Why don't we...
-Number 22!

311
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:25,080
Number 22! Where is number 22?

312
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,000
Please step up!

313
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:29,920
I'll say it first.

314
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:50,680
Good evening.

315
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,320
-I'm Yuan Song.
-Hello.

316
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:58,520
Someone very important to me
is here tonight,

317
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:01,240
someone I like very much.

318
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,920
Today is our 78th day of dating.

319
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:12,280
We promised to announce our relationship

320
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:13,680
after three months.

321
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:17,800
We are short by 12 days,

322
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:20,520
but I have been doing well.

323
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,560
So I hope to announce it now.

324
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:32,440
No matter how many problems
there are between us,

325
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,440
as long as you're willing to step forward,

326
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,800
no matter how many steps
it will take in the future,

327
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,640
I will walk towards you.

328
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,000
So now,

329
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,120
will you

330
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,680
step out of the crowd for me?

331
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:46,360
Let's pick another candidate.

332
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:48,800
He Fanxing!

333
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,800
What did you mean by that?

334
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,480
What are you doing?

335
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,240
Let's go back to the stage.

336
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,520
No!

337
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,880
There are only over ten days left.
I have to announce it.

338
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,120
We're just dating.
There is nothing wrong with it!

339
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,760
I shouldn't have listened to you
and given you three months.

340
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:14,200
-Let me go!
-No, I won't!

341
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,880
If you refuse to go back,

342
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,480
then we're done.

343
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,240
Okay, then we're done.

344
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,200
Let's break up.

345
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,360
So today,

346
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:14,880
you didn't come here for the masquerade.

347
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,920
You came here to break up with me.

348
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,000
That's not it.

349
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:22,920
That wasn't it,

350
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:25,880
but now it is.

351
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,160
Why?

352
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,640
It's just a ten-year gap,

353
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,000
but you were ashamed to take me
to your gathering.

354
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:33,960
It's not about the age difference.

355
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,200
Age is just one of the problems.

356
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:40,320
You know that I am ten years younger.

357
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,200
You knew from the very beginning.

358
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,440
Yes.

359
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:47,200
So age is not the reason
we're breaking up.

360
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,920
Neither it is about how many steps
we have taken towards each other.

361
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,600
We have hit a dead end.

362
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,240
I can't go on anymore.

363
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,960
Why can't we go on anymore?

364
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,560
If you want marriage
to be on the table, then fine.

365
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:04,760
-I can--
-I don't want that.

366
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:12,600
I get it now.

367
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,560
You never cared
if Meiyin was my ex or not,

368
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:20,880
or if my friends thought you were my maid

369
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,800
because you just wanted
to date me for three months.

370
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,360
Am I right?

371
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,240
I can be the bad guy,

372
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,840
but please don't twist my words.

373
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,480
I do care.

374
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,640
I kept waiting for you to tell me.

375
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,320
Why didn't you just ask?

376
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,640
Didn't you keep quiet
because you wanted to hide it?

377
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,640
No!

378
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:51,640
I just thought those trivial things
were not worth mentioning!

379
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:52,960
What about studying abroad?

380
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,120
Is it not worth mentioning either?

381
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:58,360
I didn't mention it because I'm not going!

382
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:03,560
Why not?

383
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:05,960
It's because of you!

384
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,240
Where else can I go when you're here?

385
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,880
I never asked you to do this for me.

386
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,760
This will affect your future,
so don't be impulsive!

387
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:20,440
I have already thought it through.

388
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:24,000
If I go abroad and leave you here,

389
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:27,320
you might marry your good friend
while I'm still being kept in the dark.

390
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,920
Can you stop spouting nonsense?

391
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:29,840
Why?

392
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:31,640
Are you mad because I'm right?

393
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:33,360
You're a two-timer!

394
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,160
Don't accuse me of that.

395
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,800
You're the only person I like.

396
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:58,720
So what?

397
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,480
You don't trust me

398
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,480
just because I'm younger.

399
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:07,360
In your plan, I am just someone
who can be your first love.

400
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,000
After you have fulfilled your dream,

401
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,760
I will be someone who eventually leaves.

402
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:16,480
You have never thought about our future.

403
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:17,920
So...

404
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,480
I was never included

405
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:22,520
in your future plans.

406
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:39,160
Didn't you say

407
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,160
that happiness matters the most
in a relationship?

408
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,120
We have only shown our best sides.

409
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:52,040
We know nothing about each other's life.

410
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:56,560
Now that we're not happy,

411
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:01,280
we can no longer go on.

412
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,040
Okay.

413
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:18,560
Let's break up.

414
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,040
Since we're unhappy, there is no point.

415
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:23,440
When we meet again,

416
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:26,920
just act like how we were before.

417
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:33,240
Okay.

418
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,560
That's for the best.

419
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:53,960
<i>I know.</i>

420
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:56,840
<i>After one month</i>

421
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:59,240
<i>or two months,</i>

422
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,120
<i>or at most six months</i>,

423
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,200
<i>or a year,</i>

424
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,920
<i>I will forget him</i>

425
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:10,480
<i>and move forward.</i>

426
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:14,800
<i>I also know</i>

427
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:18,560
<i>that everything will fade
with the passage of time.</i>

428
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:20,960
<i>It will cure everything,</i>

429
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,760
<i>or kill everything.</i>

430
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,280
<i>But...</i>

431
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:35,000
<i>It's just that...</i>

432
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:35,960
You're amazing.

433
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,680
You dumped two guys in one night
but you're the one crying.

434
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,960
It's okay, I can take a taxi.

435
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,120
What am I to you?

436
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:52,720
A napkin that you can throw away
once you're done with it?

437
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,280
I'm not in the mood to fight.

438
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,320
I have such bad luck.

439
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:03,280
You're always crying for other guys.

440
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:04,680
I'm such a loser.

441
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:10,280
Fine, I'll take you home.

442
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:12,560
Seat belt, please.

443
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,080
Hello, who is this?

444
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:35,520
<i>Professor He, come quickly! I have news!</i>

445
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:38,080
<i>Yuan Song was dumped by his girlfriend
and he wants to kill himself!</i>

446
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:43,720
What?

447
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,280
Hey.

448
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:00,840
Why does he want to kill himself?

449
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,160
Did you force him to marry you?

450
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,720
Stop joking, I'm really worried.

451
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:08,120
He just keeps crying.

452
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:10,080
People like that are usually suicidal.

453
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,400
I thought...

454
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:16,199
Isn't that good?

455
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:18,239
You like him so much, so take this chance.

456
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,080
He's crying so much that I'm scared.

457
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:21,719
How could I do that?

458
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:25,560
He pulled some strings to confess his love

459
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:27,520
without a mask on stage.

460
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:28,679
It was so embarrassing.

461
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:30,080
Really?

462
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,280
She must be some freaking pretty goddess.

463
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,040
I only saw her back, so I can't say.

464
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,120
Why are you crying?

465
00:34:50,199 --> 00:34:51,960
Just from being dumped? Are you a kid?

466
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:59,120
All right, stop crying.

467
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:02,240
Let's drown your sorrows.

468
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,600
Come on!

469
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:05,920
Let's go.

470
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,680
What do you mean?

471
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,320
Why do you need to drown it?

472
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,560
How will you drown it?

473
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:13,200
Wait up, let me change. I want to go too.

474
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,440
Is this called drowning sorrows?

475
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:28,040
Get wasted to run away from reality.

476
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,880
If that's not drowning sorrows,
then what is?

477
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,560
But it doesn't solve the issue.

478
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,640
You don't understand.

479
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:37,560
He's so drunk now

480
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,440
that he'll be nauseous tomorrow

481
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:41,200
when he thinks of her.

482
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:44,640
That feeling will be linked to that girl.

483
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:46,080
From now on,

484
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,760
memories of her
will make him feel nauseous.

485
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,400
He will get over her soon.

486
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,400
Professor He, you're very wise.
Here's to you.

487
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,480
I still don't understand though.

488
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,520
They were in a relationship.

489
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:06,440
Why did he need to confess his love?

490
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:10,000
I think they promised
to try dating for three months.

491
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:12,800
They would go public if it went well,
and break up if it didn't.

492
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:17,040
He thought he could announce it already,
but his girlfriend thought otherwise.

493
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,760
I don't get it either.

494
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,280
It's not like finding a job.

495
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,960
Why is there a trial period?

496
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:25,120
This relationship...

497
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,920
feels oddly familiar somehow.

498
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:30,760
Have you tried it before?

499
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,440
No, I would be glad to try it though.

500
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,000
Yuan Song is so silly.

501
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:42,240
He should have just gone
after her and said,

502
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,960
"No, I won't break up with you."

503
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:47,640
Girls like domineering men, right?

504
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,280
I did!

505
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,200
I ran to the door!

506
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:57,960
You're not drunk?

507
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:17,160
Is that terminal lucidity?

508
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,000
You should read more!

509
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:20,440
What terminal lucidity?

510
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:24,360
What about you? What's going on with you?

511
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:27,440
Professor Song said you're failing so bad
that you might not be able to graduate.

512
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:29,080
How did you get into college?

513
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,000
I have skills.

514
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,120
You have skills?

515
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:34,760
Yes, in sports.

516
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:37,000
I'm a level two
national synchronized swimming athlete.

517
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,240
Why are you in college then?

518
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,600
Isn't it better to join the Olympics
and bring glory to China?

519
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:46,000
I kept forgetting the moves,
so my coach asked me to quit.

520
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,800
But it's not that bad.

521
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,360
Training was torture.

522
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:59,040
There were many things I couldn't eat.
I couldn't go out and shop either.

523
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:01,840
I don't have big ambitions

524
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,960
and my family's money is enough for me.

525
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:06,120
I just want to be a happy heiress.

526
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,520
Then get married and have babies.

527
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,800
When my parents and uncle are old,

528
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,280
I will take good care of them.

529
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:15,120
You're so young,
yet you're thinking of marriage and kids?

530
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:18,880
It's better to plan these things
in advance.

531
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:24,440
Look at Yuan Song.
He's so handsome and smart.

532
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:26,160
He must have good genes.

533
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,680
His children will definitely
be beautiful too.

534
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,440
You're just a bit old.

535
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:42,920
But you have good genes too.

536
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:45,880
Am I old?

537
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:48,680
I'm only 32.

538
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:51,720
To someone like me who was born in 1995,

539
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,800
a person in his 30s
is considered an old man.

540
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:14,960
He threw up on me.

541
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,440
It's so disgusting.

542
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,960
Okay, he should be fine now. Let's go.

543
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:36,240
I'm still worried.
Let me stay and look after him.

544
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:38,720
I would be worried if you were to stay.

545
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,000
You might molest him.

546
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:42,520
I'll try my best to control myself.

547
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,960
The dorm is closed now,
so I can't go back.

548
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:51,320
You still can't stay.

549
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:54,880
I'm your teacher,
so I can't let you be in the headlines.

550
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:56,200
Let's go.

551
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:24,080
