1
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,080
You don't have to give me
your answer right now.

2
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,520
I'll give you the answer now.

3
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,520
Melon,

4
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,600
thank you for liking me.

5
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,360
But I like someone else.

6
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,280
I've confessed to her.

7
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,760
Now, I'm also waiting for her answer.

8
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,800
It's dreadful to have your emotions

9
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,800
in the hands of others.

10
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,160
I'm sorry.

11
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,040
Yuan Song.

12
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:47,920
It's okay.

13
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,960
Next, you'll tell me I'm a good person.

14
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,880
I know how it goes.

15
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:02,200
I was prepared to be rejected
after I chose to confess publicly.

16
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,360
Don't feel sorry.

17
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,560
I failed this year,

18
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:08,960
but I'll try again next year.

19
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,040
I was hiding the fact that I like you.

20
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,520
Now I've brought it to light.

21
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,880
I'm young. I can wait.

22
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,040
Until you fall for me.

23
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,760
Or when I fall for another man.

24
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,240
That's right.

25
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,240
You're a truly modern woman born in 1995.

26
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,120
You're responsible and stoic.

27
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,680
I just know good things will happen.

28
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:40,520
Not only Yuan Song will be yours,
but the world as well.

29
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,040
Of course. Let's cut the cake!

30
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:47,280
If I'm held hostage by Melon someday,
please call the police.

31
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,320
Okay, let's cut the cake.

32
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,640
I'll avenge you, Melon!

33
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,560
What? Avenge me? Liu Zhanni!

34
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,120
<i>-Happy birthday to Melon!</i>
<i>-Happy birthday to Melon!</i>

35
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:17,320
<i>-Happy birthday to Melon</i>
<i>-Happy birthday to Melon</i>

36
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,360
So embarrassing.

37
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,840
You're so messy when you're drunk.

38
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,920
Can you really take them back on your own?

39
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,920
It's not a problem.

40
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,480
I've seen them like this many times.

41
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,920
Thank you for taking care of this.

42
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,160
Will you ignore me after this?

43
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,920
Of course not.

44
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,520
You're saying we can't be friends
if we can't be lovers?

45
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,200
Of course not.

46
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,640
I won't give up.

47
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:50,720
You wish.

48
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,760
The bus is here.

49
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:59,040
Let's go. Hurry up and get on.

50
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,520
Take care.

51
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:10,080
I hope the girl you like rejects you!

52
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,000
<i>First love</i>

53
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,680
<i>is like getting caught in
a sudden heavy downpour.</i>

54
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,400
<i>Like a sudden taste of sourness
from a lemon you're eating.</i>

55
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,520
<i>Like suddenly pricking your finger
from the rose you're holding.</i>

56
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,120
<i>It's also like the brilliant sun
during spring in March.</i>

57
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,360
Wake up, Melon. It's half-past ten.

58
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,400
Five more minutes.

59
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,680
Goodness.

60
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,400
What a foul stench of alcohol.
Get up and take a bath!

61
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,840
I'm going to turn into ash!

62
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,360
Close the curtains!

63
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,880
What are you talking about? Get up!

64
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,920
-Go take a bath!
-Dirty Old Man Ye!

65
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,600
Let me go!

66
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,480
Mom, save me! Oh my goodness.

67
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,080
Why are you looking for your mom now?

68
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,400
-It's no use asking for help.
-That hurts.

69
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,520
Your sleeve is in the bowl.

70
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:54,880
Give me a break.

71
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,720
Taking care of a child is so frustrating.

72
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,320
When they're small,
we're worried they'd get lost.

73
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,560
Or if they'd get hurt.

74
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,600
When they're grown up,

75
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,520
we're worried they'll get mixed up
with bad guys.

76
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:12,080
And then run back home drunk and crying.

77
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,400
Yuan Song is not a bad guy.

78
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,840
It's just that
he doesn't like me right now.

79
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,080
Am I so terrible?

80
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,400
Why won't he accept me?

81
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,600
-Stop.
-Accept me...

82
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:32,080
"Am I so terrible?
Why won't he accept me?"

83
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:35,320
Those are the mistaken ideas
that run in the Ye family.

84
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:39,480
Not all failures are caused by one's self.

85
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,040
There are two reasons
why you were rejected.

86
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,400
First, he doesn't like you.

87
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:48,480
Second, he hasn't liked you yet.

88
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,280
Right.

89
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,240
I won't give up.

90
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,280
I'll wait for my chance
when they break up.

91
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,120
That's my niece.

92
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,920
What type of person does your senior like?

93
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,400
I don't know. I didn't ask.

94
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,200
Listening to my crush
talking about his crush?

95
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,360
Why would I torture myself?

96
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,280
Aren't you waiting for a chance?

97
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,800
"You must know your enemy to win."

98
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,120
Have you ever heard of that?

99
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,600
Read more books.

100
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,600
You got a lot of advice to give.

101
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:30,400
But wasn't your blind date yesterday
a failure?

102
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,000
Who told you yesterday's date
was a failure?

103
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:43,960
What is this?

104
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,040
Is that the hand of your Love?

105
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,600
Didn't you fail?

106
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,000
Only children like you cry
when you face hardship.

107
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,960
Adults will always
prepare a Plan A and a Plan B.

108
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:00,400
If Plan A fails, we execute Plan B.

109
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,960
She needs a new love instructor.

110
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,080
Guess who is playing that role?

111
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,360
So treacherous.

112
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,880
But I like it.

113
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,960
Tell me all about it.

114
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,360
Okay, it's like this.

115
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,080
A boy ten years younger than her
is wooing her.

116
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,200
She likes him and wants to say yes.

117
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,760
But she's clueless on
how to deal with the problems

118
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,440
that come with their age gap.

119
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,840
So she was troubled by it.

120
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:36,880
Therefore,
I gave her the perfect solution.

121
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:40,640
So are you the majority or the minority?

122
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,960
Only those without a solution
will choose a side.

123
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:50,560
There is a solution
that offers the best of both worlds.

124
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,680
You can enjoy your relationship

125
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,200
and avoid the social pressure of it.

126
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,520
Your relationship can be smooth sailing

127
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,520
with a bright future.

128
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,120
The best way is

129
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,400
to keep it a secret.

130
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,600
To keep it a secret?

131
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,040
A company that I collaborated with

132
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,400
has this one rule.

133
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,560
They forbid office romance.

134
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,880
If they find out,

135
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,320
one of the employees must resign.

136
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,040
This company has great employee benefits,

137
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,280
so no one wants to leave.

138
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,560
But the office setting itself

139
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,960
is the most conducive environment
for romance to bloom.

140
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,560
And when it happens,

141
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,280
what should they do?

142
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,240
Keep it a secret.

143
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:34,200
If there's a policy,
there's a way around it.

144
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:37,720
Any employer is worried
that if they break up,

145
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,320
it will affect their performance.

146
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,880
This is why many office romances
happen quietly

147
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,640
and end quietly.

148
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,720
As no one knows about their romance,

149
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,920
they won't feel awkward after breaking up.

150
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,880
In your case,

151
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,720
you have to keep it a secret.

152
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,640
Think about it, he's a man in his 20s.

153
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:58,800
What if

154
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,040
he was a bit taller?

155
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,160
More handsome?

156
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,680
More amiable?

157
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,400
The world is vast.

158
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,000
There's temptation all around.

159
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,120
No one can be sure of the future.

160
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,480
What if the relationship ends
and he resigns?

161
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,960
You will be the one
left to clean up the mess.

162
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,240
You'll be criticized as well.

163
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,680
I'm fine with that.

164
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:28,080
I just can't let my parents
endure the gossips that will come.

165
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,280
Exactly!

166
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,880
Humans are social animals.

167
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:34,520
And social standing
is very important in China.

168
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,920
Gossip can't drown us.

169
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,240
But it can drown our parents.

170
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,840
Have you heard of this saying?

171
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,720
"Parents' tears

172
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,320
always drown relationships."

173
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,320
You sly old fox, I don't understand you.

174
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:54,000
Why didn't you just tell her to reject it?

175
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,400
Wouldn't that be faster?

176
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,560
Could you please respect
that we're all independent individuals?

177
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,480
Don't decide for others.

178
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,880
Just giving some of your opinions will do.

179
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,280
Besides,

180
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,000
keeping it a secret

181
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,720
undermines the relationship by itself.

182
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,720
I don't think that guy will accept
the idea of keeping it a secret.

183
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,720
Why? Why won't he do that?

184
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:16,760
Think for yourself.

185
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,880
I'm just waiting for the news

186
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:23,680
that she was turned down by the bad guy.

187
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,360
MS. HE

188
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,200
Hello?

189
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,040
Now?

190
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,520
Can't you wait until tonight to reject me?

191
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:03,560
Didn't you say you'll only accept "yes"
as the answer?

192
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,080
So you're saying, "yes" as your answer?

193
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,280
Can I give you another answer?

194
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:11,760
Sure.

195
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:14,760
But you said you'll tell Mr. Li
and He Canyang.

196
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,640
I won't do that.

197
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,640
I just wanted to tease you.

198
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,560
I know.

199
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,560
You must give me a clear answer.

200
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,120
If not,

201
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,000
I'm scared I'll misunderstand.

202
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,600
This is my first time dating someone.

203
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,600
So I don't know how to begin.

204
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:46,560
Nor do I know what to say or what to do.

205
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,920
I don't know anything.

206
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,440
Then let's hold hands first.

207
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,040
Wait.

208
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:02,720
I...

209
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,080
have a request.

210
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,520
Can our relationship

211
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,520
be a secret?

212
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:12,920
A secret?

213
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,280
If our colleagues know,

214
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:20,160
I'll be in a difficult position.

215
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:24,080
Furthermore, my parents
will have to endure others' opinions.

216
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,880
Since it's about the two of us,

217
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,120
we won't have to let others know.

218
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:30,640
I suppose

219
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,560
you wouldn't want
to explain yourself a lot

220
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,200
to your family and friends as well.

221
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:38,040
And you're still young.

222
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:43,560
I'll just be
one of the milestones in your life.

223
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,680
Why must we let ourselves suffer
over something temporary?

224
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,040
Right?

225
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,680
Like when I was in university.

226
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:54,320
My best friend dated He Canyang.

227
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,880
They even kept it a secret from me.

228
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,400
I only knew about it when they broke up.

229
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,760
If we keep it like this,

230
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,640
it'll be just like when we're in school.

231
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,800
Keeping it from our teachers and parents.

232
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,000
It sounds interesting, right?

233
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:19,800
What's wrong?

234
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,800
It sounds like a good idea.

235
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,520
No one will know that we're together.

236
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,600
Even if we break up,

237
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,800
no one will know besides us.

238
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,120
This is safe for us.

239
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,880
We can avoid a lot of issues.

240
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:35,720
Yes.

241
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:39,560
If we face some problems ahead,

242
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,600
there's a chance we'd get hurt in return.

243
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:45,080
But it's natural that some issues came up
in a relationship.

244
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,960
If we want to avoid trouble
by running away,

245
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:50,520
what will happen next time
and the next one?

246
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,680
There's a poem that I like.

247
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,520
"High mountains are nothing to love."

248
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,400
In this kind of relationship,

249
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,640
we can't even

250
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:05,680
get over a puddle, let alone a mountain.

251
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:14,680
Only the first love of a teenage girl
is kept a secret.

252
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,840
We're adults.

253
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:18,880
It's not a secret.

254
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,400
It's an affair.

255
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,640
If it's difficult for you, then forget it.

256
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,840
Let's go back to being normal.

257
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,400
Let's go, Braised Meat.

258
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,440
<i>Fanxing,</i>

259
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:03,080
<i>is the plan
to keep it a secret going well?</i>

260
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:07,880
<i>No.</i>

261
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,280
<i>It failed.</i>

262
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:10,880
<i>He objected to it.</i>

263
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,920
I KIND OF REGRETTED A BIT...

264
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,440
YUAN SONG

265
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,240
TYPING...

266
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,120
I REGRETTED...

267
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,560
HE FANXING

268
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,600
Fanxing, why aren't you asleep yet?

269
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,240
Mom, why are you awake?

270
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,240
Listen to your dad's snoring.

271
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,880
It's like thunder.

272
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,680
I can only sleep after taking a pill.

273
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,200
Mom.

274
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:09,000
Let's say someone wants to date me.

275
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,120
But

276
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,960
we have to keep it a secret
from friends and family.

277
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:16,400
What's your opinion about it?

278
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,560
Who said this to you?

279
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,280
No one. It's just a hypothetical question.

280
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,160
I know what happened.

281
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,080
You went on a blind date yesterday, right?

282
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,320
Did the guy say this?

283
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:34,720
No wonder you were restless
during dinner tonight.

284
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,560
Who introduced you?

285
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,880
Who is this man?

286
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,960
Trash should stay in the trashcan.

287
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,400
Why spill out and stink up the place?

288
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,080
Mom.

289
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:47,800
You think being secretive is bad?

290
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,720
Don't you think being secretive is bad?

291
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,720
Why must it be a secret?

292
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:57,000
Doesn't this mean
the same as being a mistress?

293
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:02,200
Being secretive means
he doesn't want to be responsible.

294
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,600
Fanxing,

295
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,520
I hope you will be blessed one day.

296
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,560
All I want is to wish you happiness.

297
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,760
I'm not rushing you.

298
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,280
Don't feel pressured by this.

299
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,560
And don't rush things.

300
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,160
Like your dad said,

301
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,760
if you can't find anyone you like,

302
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,600
don't get married.

303
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:23,960
I won't blame you.

304
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,320
If there's a blind date,

305
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:29,160
look for someone
who is honest and forthright.

306
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,520
Never be too desperate.

307
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:33,840
I know, Mom.

308
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,400
I have work tomorrow, so I'm going to bed.

309
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,040
Fanxing,

310
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:40,160
you have to remember what I said, okay?

311
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,200
Chang Huan.

312
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,120
<i>Thank you.</i>

313
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,880
You're late.

314
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:54,840
It's only for ten minutes.

315
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,960
My best attendance bonus...

316
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,000
What happened to your eye?

317
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,480
It's fine, I fell.

318
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,280
I get going then.

319
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,120
Good morning.

320
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:09,600
Good...

321
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,440
Chang Huan!

322
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:29,840
You can't get your wound wet.

323
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,160
It'll get infected.

324
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,200
Let me treat it for you.

325
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,640
-It's a small thing. It's nothing.
-No way.

326
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:35,880
My mom always says,

327
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,720
"No facial wounds are minor."

328
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,560
Even a pimple must be properly dealt with.

329
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:42,640
If you look down on it,
it will return as bad as ever.

330
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:43,720
Here.

331
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,240
Let's put this on.

332
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:52,960
How professional.

333
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,320
It's done.

334
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,480
Thank you.

335
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,280
How about some breakfast?

336
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,520
Here's some sourdough bread.

337
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:02,880
It'll give you strength.

338
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:04,800
Great, I haven't eaten yet.

339
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,080
I'll enjoy this.

340
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,240
You're welcome.

341
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:09,360
Treat me to a meal
when you get your salary.

342
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,200
Are you making me owe you?

343
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,240
Then bring me one every day.

344
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,760
Okay, deal!

345
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,600
"Deal?"

346
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,800
What a crafty girl.

347
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,880
It's okay to be ugly indeed.

348
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,360
And there's someone who is blind too.

349
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:36,280
Chang Huan, tell Yuan Song to see Ms. He
when he arrives.

350
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,400
Okay.

351
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,160
Come in.

352
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:54,840
Ms. He.

353
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,320
Yes?

354
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:03,440
About your blind date yesterday...

355
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:05,160
Let's talk about that during lunch.

356
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,000
Are you together now?

357
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,800
I saw you two eating ice cream.

358
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,400
You were at the mall?

359
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,800
Why didn't you come over?

360
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:16,800
You two were so focused on each other.

361
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,360
I didn't want to be a third wheel.

362
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,080
You're not wrong.

363
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,920
He's a nice guy.

364
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,960
-But--
-I'm so happy for you.

365
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:27,800
May you be blessed.

366
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,680
But you owe me a meal.

367
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:31,480
I'm going back to work.

368
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,400
I give up!

369
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:48,240
Fine, we'll talk later.

370
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,360
Xiao Zeng, come to my office.

371
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:06,400
My husband, his parents and mine
planned our wedding.

372
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,280
I didn't even take
a leave of absence for it.

373
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:10,880
You don't understand.

374
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:13,360
The body of a pregnant woman changes.

375
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,040
When my mom was pregnant with me,

376
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,400
she was sick for six months.

377
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:19,400
As for me, I keep getting colds or fevers.

378
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:22,080
The doctor said
the first trimester is a critical time.

379
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,280
He asked me to rest.

380
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:25,680
I've shown you my medical certificate.

381
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:27,480
A month has 31 days.

382
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,280
And 8 days are the off days,
so you have 23 days left.

383
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:33,200
Out of the 23 days,
you were absent for 13 days.

384
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:34,640
For the remaining ten days,

385
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,080
you're late for three days,

386
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:38,080
and left early four times
without clocking out.

387
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,000
Am I right?

388
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:41,280
Fine, I won't take my salary this month.

389
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,040
Although our company

390
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,760
doesn't have specific rules

391
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:53,200
to give pregnant women special treatment,

392
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,720
the managers and department heads
had come to a consensus.

393
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:00,000
And the HR department
has been lenient with

394
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,480
all these early clock outs and leaves

395
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:03,760
by not cutting pay
or marking them as absences.

396
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:05,760
The marketing department

397
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,280
has avoided sending
pregnant employees outstation.

398
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:09,720
The engineering department

399
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,640
avoids sending pregnant employees

400
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:12,960
to unhealthy sites as well.

401
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:14,520
The design department

402
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:17,160
forbids pregnant employees
to take overtime.

403
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,280
Amazing Decoration is a small company.

404
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,080
Each person has their own position.

405
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,840
Everyone has their own tasks.

406
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,360
If your work isn't done,

407
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,840
your manager has to have others do them.

408
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,720
You're in your first trimester,

409
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,360
there are six to seven months to go.

410
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:33,040
You're going to be on maternity leave
after giving birth as well.

411
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:36,400
We can't fire pregnant employees,

412
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,520
but based on your attendance,

413
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:41,800
your manager will have
to recruit new employees.

414
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,880
You will be ostracized.

415
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,040
And with the bad impression
you're leaving,

416
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:48,400
your manager
may not hire female employees anymore.

417
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:49,920
Personally,

418
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:53,800
I don't want our company
to discriminate against female employees.

419
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,080
You can act like a princess.

420
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,920
But your colleagues are not your servants.

421
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,640
They're not here to spoil you.

422
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,920
I've been in HR for so many years.

423
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,600
I can tell the difference

424
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,520
between a real and fake doctor's note.

425
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,360
I'm sorry.

426
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,600
I didn't think this far.

427
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,240
I'll never do it again.

428
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,680
I'll apologize to everyone.

429
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,760
And then treat them to a meal.

430
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,200
Is that okay?

431
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:22,920
To apologize or to treat to a meal
is your own discretion.

432
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,960
But if your attendance
is like this next month,

433
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:27,680
I'll really beat you up.

434
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,040
I promise I won't.

435
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,040
I'll get back to work.

436
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:34,680
Go.

437
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,200
Yuan Song.

438
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:52,800
Yes, Ms. He?

439
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:57,320
I asked someone
to tell you to come to my office.

440
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,480
No one told me.

441
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,480
Let's grab lunch together.

442
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:04,560
It's on me.

443
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,160
I don't think I can.

444
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,560
I'm going to the site to meet the owner.

445
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:12,680
Next time then.

446
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,560
Sure.

447
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,240
I have to go.

448
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,080
Bye.

449
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,640
<i>It all feels like nothing happened.</i>

450
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,360
<i>Is this</i>

451
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,280
<i>a good thing?</i>

452
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:51,520
<i>Ms. He, I just passed by your office.</i>

453
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,520
<i>I'm starving.</i>

454
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:53,960
<i>Can you treat me to a meal?</i>

455
00:27:58,800 --> 00:27:59,920
Here you go.

456
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,560
Your chives and prawn wontons.

457
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,200
Here.

458
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,280
I miss this.

459
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,080
It has been so long, Mr. Ye.

460
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,400
Are you busy at the office?

461
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,560
Yes, I had no time.

462
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:13,800
I'll come often after this.

463
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,640
Is she your girlfriend?
She's so beautiful.

464
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:19,280
-No, I'm not.
-Beautiful?

465
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,920
She is beautiful,
but she's not my girlfriend.

466
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,680
We are

467
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,760
close-knit friends.

468
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,040
Close-knit?

469
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:30,400
More like,
a friendship that grows as we fight.

470
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,280
Enjoy your meal.

471
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,680
-Thanks.
-You're welcome.

472
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:38,880
Their wontons are amazing.

473
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,800
It was Mr. Li who brought me here.

474
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:41,800
Try it.

475
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:50,720
How is it?

476
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:54,160
-It's delicious!
-Right?

477
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:55,960
Their prawns are really fresh.

478
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,440
They're not frozen like at other shops.

479
00:28:58,600 --> 00:28:59,640
It's very fresh.

480
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:02,920
Frankly speaking,
when we came in, I was wondering

481
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:05,360
if you didn't want me to spend too much,

482
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:09,040
so you brought us here
as a favor to a low-paid worker.

483
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:10,160
Good day. Welcome.

484
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,280
High-class stuff is for girlfriends.

485
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:14,800
Delicious but cheap stuff

486
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,320
is for good friends.

487
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:20,360
No need to pay any attention to me,
feel free to dig in.

488
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,200
Hey.

489
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,680
You and that guy...

490
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,240
How are things?

491
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:41,920
Plan A failed.

492
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,000
I can only go with Plan B.

493
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,280
Plan B? Backing off?

494
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,120
He may be young,

495
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:53,280
but he deserves

496
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,840
a relationship he can be open about
just like any other.

497
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,040
He's right.

498
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:02,320
He's not wrong,
and you're not wrong either.

499
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:04,520
It was just a difference of opinions.

500
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:09,000
Love is a gamble after all.

501
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,720
The one who backs off first
loves the other more.

502
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,400
You love him more.

503
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:20,080
It makes sense that you backed off first.

504
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:21,520
You did nothing wrong.

505
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,000
Done.

506
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,320
Thank you so much.

507
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,680
Have a seat.

508
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:36,960
Please have a drink.

509
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,080
I appreciate it.

510
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,080
It's my job.

511
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:42,560
If your wife is satisfied with this,
you can inform us of it.

512
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,000
It hasn't been easy.

513
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:47,600
I've liked my wife for over five years.

514
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:50,160
And now we finally have a home.

515
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,600
Five years?

516
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:58,360
I heard it was a case of
love at first sight just half a year ago?

517
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,760
A fateful love at first sight?

518
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:02,440
Only fools would believe that.

519
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,560
I read over 5,000 of her Weibo posts.

520
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,120
I followed her preferences

521
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:09,080
and wore only white T-shirts
and changed my hairstyle.

522
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,160
I even trimmed my eyebrows.

523
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:14,320
Coincidentally emptying the trash
when she was leaving as an act.

524
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:17,360
I had a lipstick prepared
and called out to her,

525
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:19,800
"Gorgeous, is this your lipstick?"

526
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:22,760
Does she know this?

527
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:25,360
She told me before our marriage

528
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:26,880
that she knew everything.

529
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:30,320
Because that lipstick was brand new.

530
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:31,520
It was unused.

531
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:35,080
You both really are a couple.
A totally crafty pair.

532
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:39,520
Thirty percent destiny,
seventy percent hard work.

533
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:41,080
Destiny?

534
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,200
It's impossible.

535
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,240
He Fanxing!

536
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:03,360
Present!

537
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,640
Why didn't you call me?

538
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,080
You like feeding the mosquitoes out there?

539
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:28,200
I didn't know that you'd be late.

540
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:32,520
Besides, aren't you hiding from me?

541
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,000
What would you like to drink?

542
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,800
-A soda?
-Don't have any.

543
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:42,880
-Orange juice?
-Don't have any.

544
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:46,360
Have some water.

545
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:56,560
Don't you think being secretive is bad?

546
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:57,840
Why must it be a secret?

547
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:00,440
Doesn't this mean
the same as being a mistress?

548
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:05,280
Being secretive means
he doesn't want to be responsible.

549
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:12,400
You keep peeking at me and sighing.

550
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,800
Did I give you a hard time again?

551
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,040
No.

552
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,120
Not peeking or not giving a hard time?

553
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,480
Not giving a hard time.

554
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:22,680
So you were peeking at me.

555
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:37,880
If you choose your way to live your life,
you bear the burden of it.

556
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:40,720
I told you I wouldn't hide it,
but you still came.

557
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,840
I've thought about it.

558
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,840
I really do like you.

559
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:52,280
Until you want to hide it all from others?

560
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,560
You like me.

561
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:57,000
But you don't trust me. You doubt me.

562
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,080
But

563
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,840
isn't it normal to be doubtful?

564
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,880
I'm already 32 years old.

565
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,800
I'm not an 18-year-old girl

566
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:09,080
who thinks love conquers all
and everything can be sacrificed for it.

567
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,400
I thought you came to apologize.

568
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:14,280
I am.

569
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:15,600
You're here to lecture me.

570
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:16,960
You want to tell me

571
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:19,440
that a kid like me should stop dreaming.

572
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:22,320
Can you stop being so negative?

573
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,960
Don't twist what I'm saying.

574
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:25,400
Look at you.

575
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,880
You treat me like an enemy or something.

576
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:29,520
Did I wrong you in some way?

577
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,360
I can't complain about this?

578
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:33,240
I avoided you this afternoon!

579
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:34,880
But you still came here.

580
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,200
I have nowhere to hide from you!

581
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:56,400
Who said you could
come and go as you like?

582
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:59,160
Aren't you working at the company
to get a certificate?

583
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,680
I'll have it ready by tomorrow.

584
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:02,120
You won't have to hide anymore.

585
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,720
You're driving me away? Dream on!

586
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:06,640
Yuan Song!

587
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:08,680
What do you want?
Can you be reasonable here?

588
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,080
Three months!

589
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:12,640
Three months?

590
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,040
We can keep it a secret.

591
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,960
But only for three months.

592
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,640
It'll be just like an internship.

593
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:20,720
If it goes well,
you must open up about us.

594
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,320
What?

595
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:25,760
Am I being demanding at all?

596
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,400
Do you wish to date secretly forever?

597
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,120
Forever?

598
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:38,000
You're thinking of being with me forever?

599
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,600
And you say
you're not a naive 18-year-old.

600
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,760
You plan to be with me forever already?

601
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:48,600
I...

602
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:51,720
I didn't say that!

603
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:01,040
So it's a "yes" to three months.

604
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:07,480
I've never planned to hide the fact
I have a boyfriend, okay?

605
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,160
You're holding up your hands

606
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:13,320
to stop me from kissing you?

607
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,360
You're thinking too much.

608
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:46,320
You're right. I wanted to kiss you.

609
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,800
You jerk!

610
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:52,320
How can you--

611
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:19,000
<i>I'm going to bed, good night.</i>

612
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,600
<i>Good night, see you tomorrow.</i>

613
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:26,880
<i>Kisses for you.</i>

614
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:54,160
Good morning, Ms. He.

615
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,240
Good morning.

616
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,320
-You look particularly happy today.
<i>-Thank you.</i>

617
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,240
Something good happened?

618
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:01,840
You forgot today is payday?

619
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,240
Payday!

620
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,080
-Ms. He.
-Yes?

621
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:16,480
Chang Huan said he and Cong Xiao

622
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,520
will be doing promotions on-site
for two days.

623
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,400
Can they get exemptions
regarding clocking in?

624
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:21,600
Okay.

625
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:23,200
Send me a notice later.

626
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,760
Cong Xiao, go ahead.

627
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:25,800
Okay.

628
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:37,240
Burning the midnight oil?

629
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,520
What's wrong with your waist?

630
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:40,840
I sprained it.

631
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:43,160
Old people tend to do that.

632
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:46,240
I'm good at massages.
Want to give it a try?

633
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:53,000
My mom has a bad back.

634
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,280
It's fine, thanks.

635
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:58,680
Take care of your mom.

636
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:07,320
Work hard and don't slack.

637
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:20,560
Stop making her angry.

638
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:21,720
I didn't.

639
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,480
She's so cute
so I couldn't resist teasing her.

640
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:26,000
You have a death wish.

641
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:27,280
Are you tired of living?

642
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,080
Cong Xiao!

643
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:34,000
Are you done packing?
Why are you still here?

644
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:36,560
People in love are different.

645
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:40,040
A happy heart makes the face cheerful.

646
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,880
<i>I want an orange-flavored kiss today.</i>

647
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:59,000
Ms. He, your documents.

648
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,160
Thank you.

649
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:02,400
Why are you so flushed?

650
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:03,600
Do you have a fever?

651
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:05,640
Really?

652
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:06,680
I'm fine.

653
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,600
-I have some medicine.
-No, it's okay!

654
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:10,560
I have some myself.

655
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:13,600
Okay, call me if you need anything.

656
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:14,960
Okay, you can go now.

657
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:18,680
I'll help you finish this.

658
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:25,560
My candy.

659
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:41,560
Eat a lot.

660
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:43,480
Go back to school after this.

661
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,760
Don't skip class out of embarrassment.

662
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:49,360
I didn't skip class out of embarrassment.

663
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:51,040
It's because I was sick.

664
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:54,640
I slept at home, played mobile games,

665
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,280
played with Love Charm

666
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:58,880
and was happy like a fairy.
I wouldn't want to date after that, right?

667
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:06,000
Other peoples' children
think of becoming scientists,

668
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:08,160
dancers or writers.

669
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:11,040
They don't know what they're really doing,

670
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:13,400
but it's a great goal at least, right?

671
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:14,560
But look at you.

672
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:18,240
You always said you want
to go to amusement parks

673
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,840
or eat ice cream every day.

674
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:21,520
What else? Eat chocolates all day?

675
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:24,200
As the saying goes,
"The child is the father of the man."

676
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,240
What are you going to do when you grow up?

677
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:29,120
Old Man Ye, why are you so ungrateful?

678
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:31,680
My parents took care of me

679
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,760
even by being hawkers
after working their day jobs.

680
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:35,320
We were poor back then.

681
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:39,360
You were all hoping to let me live
without any worries in the world.

682
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:41,360
So when other children had chocolate,

683
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,680
I wouldn't have to look on pathetically.

684
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:46,160
Yes.

685
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,360
-Though you're right--
-Yes.

686
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,200
I'm right without a doubt.

687
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:53,080
All your wishes have come true now.

688
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:54,880
Your company is so successful.

689
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,360
My mom's salon has branches all over.

690
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:00,200
I'm now considered
a rich second-generation heir.

691
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:03,920
As a rich kid,
I swear not to commit illegal acts

692
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,160
or bully the weak.

693
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:08,320
I will stay home spending money
and leading a blissful life.

694
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:11,160
That's how I can repay
my hardworking uncle and parents.

695
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:17,360
Then when I marry my goddess
and have kids,

696
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:20,160
what if my children
takes you as a role model

697
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:22,600
and spend all the money I have?

698
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:25,240
They won't.

699
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:29,280
Let your children
see me as the anti role model.

700
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:31,160
They have to make their mark in the world.

701
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:35,760
If they don't, who's going to feed
their lazy and gluttonous cousin?

702
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:41,640
Are you that shameless?

703
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:53,360
<i>Melon, did you look
at your WeChat Moments?</i>

704
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:54,720
<i>Your dream guy has been taken.</i>

705
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:56,000
<i>I did it!</i>

706
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:57,520
MOMENTS, HE FANXING

707
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:58,960
YUAN SONG

708
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:06,160
Shit.

709
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:10,920
What is it?

710
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:14,320
Nothing, it's university stuff.

711
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:16,080
You?

712
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:18,880
Nothing, it's company stuff.

713
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:28,520
