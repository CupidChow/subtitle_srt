1
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,880
You set foot in my office at 2:50 p.m.

2
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,480
What is wrong with that?

3
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,040
Su Li said you're the executive director.

4
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,880
You must know the company policies well.

5
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,040
We set rules for working hours,

6
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,280
contractual terms,

7
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:33,200
so on and so forth,
for people to obey them!

8
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,240
Any violation of the agreed hours

9
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,600
should be punished!

10
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:37,960
You are right.

11
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,720
I am sorry.

12
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,240
But...

13
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,320
But?

14
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,040
But what?

15
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,360
But you're the client?

16
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,680
Indeed, you are,

17
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,520
but you can't just do as you please
and violate the terms!

18
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,240
I don't want to hear excuses!

19
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,720
How ridiculous.

20
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,000
An executive director
without a sense of time.

21
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,680
Now I honestly think that

22
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:01,480
ending the partnership was a wise choice.

23
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,040
I am sorry.

24
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,120
I didn't know the agreed time.

25
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,080
I am just here to deliver.

26
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,040
-So...
-So you're saying you're not wrong?

27
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,080
Because you don't know?

28
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,120
What don't you know?

29
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,360
Then why would you help?

30
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,400
Who are you helping? Are you helping me?

31
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,040
Is your company a joke?

32
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,640
How could you be a director?

33
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,440
Is it because of your face
as claimed by others?

34
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,680
Mr. Ye.

35
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:24,800
I...

36
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,560
Bring me a size 36 dress.

37
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,920
The reception will bring you
a change of clothes.

38
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,200
When you meet Mr. Li, please tell him

39
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,920
to set a time
for the termination of our contract.

40
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,120
You may leave.

41
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:06,400
<i>I just want to date someone.</i>

42
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,520
<i>I guess I can't, right?</i>

43
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,600
Hey.

44
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,160
What's going on?

45
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,120
Why are you crying here?

46
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,680
I'm not crying.

47
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,120
Don't try and act pitiful!

48
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,080
This trick may work on your boyfriend,

49
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,520
but not me!

50
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:30,920
This is work!

51
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,440
What do you want?

52
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,280
I am sorry.

53
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,800
I can't help it.

54
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,880
Control yourself!

55
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,560
Breathe.

56
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,480
Breathe.

57
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,040
Don't cry.

58
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,120
Can you stop crying?

59
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,800
Don't threaten me by crying.

60
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,440
I won't give in!

61
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,800
The contract must be terminated!

62
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,520
What's going on?

63
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,760
Good morning, Ms. He.

64
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,880
Did you sleep well last night?

65
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,960
<i>What a weird dream.</i>

66
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,160
<i>Why did I dream of Yuan Song?</i>

67
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,000
<i>Do I have feelings for him?</i>

68
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,440
<i>No way.</i>

69
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,520
<i>It must be because we drank together.</i>

70
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,200
We drank together?

71
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,840
We came here together.

72
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,120
How can you drink alone?

73
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,400
I'll drink too.

74
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,960
This is life.

75
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,960
A lucky day turned into a bad day.

76
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:28,360
A romantic drama turns into a melodrama.

77
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,040
When you are all pumped up,

78
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,800
cold water will come pouring.

79
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,400
Telling you to wake up.

80
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,320
I am already awake.

81
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,200
But there are many people

82
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,120
who are still living their lives
in a blur.

83
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,720
I refuse to be one of them!

84
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,480
Hey.

85
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,720
Are you close with the guy today,

86
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,640
Li Haomiao?

87
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,160
We're friends from university.

88
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,280
Best friends.

89
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,800
Li Haomiao had stars

90
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:00,240
in his eyes back then.

91
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,360
They would glitter.

92
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,840
I always thought that...

93
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,280
he was like a preservative

94
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,240
that would never expire.

95
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,280
Dearest Ms. He, preservatives expire too.

96
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,000
Everything in this world

97
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,160
has a shelf life.

98
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,200
So...

99
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,440
Has my first love expired?

100
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,280
Your first love's shelf life

101
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,520
is decided by you.

102
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,480
If you give up,

103
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:34,600
it expires.

104
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:47,960
Thankfully,

105
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,400
the bunny is alive.

106
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,360
Bunny?

107
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,800
There is a bunny in here.

108
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,080
So...

109
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,960
you've been waiting for Li Haomiao

110
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,800
because of the promise
when both of you turn 35.

111
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,280
How is that possible?

112
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,560
An agreement on time

113
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:12,600
only counts when the time comes.

114
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,320
All these years,

115
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,880
I have been trying
to find someone I like too.

116
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:21,120
I think I haven't found the right one.

117
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,800
Li Haomiao is getting married.

118
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,080
He even wants me to be the bridesmaid!

119
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:30,280
This is my fourth time
being a bridesmaid already!

120
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:31,680
They said that those

121
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,320
who have become
a bridesmaid more than thrice

122
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,680
will never get married!

123
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:39,520
Hey.

124
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,280
Are you that desperate to get married?

125
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,680
I don't want to marry them.

126
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:43,920
Who would want to?

127
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:48,440
Who is going to buy
the house after marriage?

128
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,680
How will we support our parents?

129
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,640
How many kids do we want?

130
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,000
Are you crazy?

131
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,160
This is our first meetup, okay?

132
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,480
This is a secret.

133
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,640
No one else can find out.

134
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,360
This is my secret.

135
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,600
Let me tell you.

136
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:37,560
Li Haomiao was at the South Pole alone.

137
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,920
All alone.

138
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,280
No one would date him.

139
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:46,160
Initially, I could have dated him.

140
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,080
But he's getting married.

141
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,560
But I will give him my blessings.

142
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,000
I am happy for him.

143
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,200
I just...

144
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,960
want to date someone.

145
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,000
Is that so hard?

146
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,520
I may have lost

147
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:39,480
my last chance for a first love.

148
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,440
This won't be your last.

149
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,360
Someone will date you.

150
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,680
What are you doing?

151
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:20,680
There are stars in your eyes.

152
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,240
They are glittering.

153
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,160
Can you

154
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:33,320
date me?

155
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,560
Can you

156
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,320
date me?

157
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,400
He Fanxing!

158
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,160
Mom told you to get up and eat!

159
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,560
What are you doing?

160
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,040
He Canyang!

161
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,480
Who let you into my room?

162
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,280
Get out!

163
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,880
Why are you pissed in the morning?

164
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,120
Are you sexually frustrated?

165
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,480
-Get up and eat.
-You!

166
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,920
Baylor!

167
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,440
That's right!
Go bite your dad, He Canyang!

168
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,400
That jerk!

169
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,120
Mom, the egg is burned.

170
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,440
It's me. I was the one who fried it.

171
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:31,760
I got distracted.

172
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,880
Should I fry you another one?

173
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,720
No, it is fine. I will eat this.

174
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,560
Dad, I want one that is not burned.

175
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,920
Take it or leave it!

176
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,360
What...

177
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,480
What is wrong?

178
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,080
It is nothing.

179
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,040
Eat up.

180
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,440
Didn't your school

181
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:01,600
allocate dorms for associate professors

182
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,160
and those above?

183
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,000
You should move there.

184
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,360
Mom.

185
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,600
Isn't it good that
your son lives next door?

186
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,960
Everyone else is envious.

187
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,640
Who is envious of us?

188
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,560
Who?

189
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:22,880
Who?

190
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:23,880
Who?

191
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,480
Mrs. Wang from downstairs.

192
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,120
Downstairs?

193
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,600
So it is that Mrs. Wang

194
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,400
who has a pair of

195
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,200
twin granddaughters.

196
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,520
They're envious that I have a pig

197
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:43,040
who devours others' precious daughters.

198
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,800
I can't think straight.

199
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,360
I couldn't sleep last night.

200
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,160
My blood pressure is rising too.

201
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:52,960
Right.

202
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,680
I'll have a cold beer.

203
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,000
I want one too.

204
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,960
Who came to our doorstep?

205
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,440
<i>Do you want to know?</i>

206
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,480
<i>I happened to record it.</i>

207
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,800
Are you a pervert or what?

208
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,080
You even recorded it.

209
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,840
<i>He Canyang!</i>

210
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,280
<i>Who are you to say</i>

211
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,680
<i>that our personalities don't match?</i>

212
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,360
<i>Come out!</i>

213
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,840
<i>Listen to me!</i>

214
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:04,880
<i>You and I are perfect for each other!</i>

215
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,400
<i>He Canyang, come out!</i>

216
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,320
<i>You...</i>

217
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,120
<i>You jerk!</i>

218
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:14,000
<i>Come out and apologize on your knees!</i>

219
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,640
<i>Jerk!</i>

220
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:28,880
He Canyang!

221
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,640
Come out!

222
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,480
Are you here because of He Canyang too?

223
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,600
He Canyang, you jerk!

224
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,960
He Canyang!

225
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,560
Why did you drink so much?

226
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,440
-Li Haomiao is getting married!
-He Canyang!

227
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,440
Getting married?

228
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,440
-You can't hug other women!
-Wait!

229
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,280
-She is my older sister.
-Nobody wants to marry me.

230
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,960
-I don't care!
-I don't want to live anymore.

231
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,920
-He Canyang!
-I want to get married.

232
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,720
You can't hug other women!

233
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,040
You jerk!

234
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,760
You shouldn't hug other women!

235
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,400
Get out!

236
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:28,880
Hey!

237
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:30,960
He Canyang!

238
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,560
He Canyang!

239
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,760
Open the door!

240
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,360
Twenty-two-year-old boys
aren't mature at all.

241
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,760
If you drink with an elder,

242
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,160
you should look after her.

243
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,760
How could you encourage her to drink?

244
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,040
What were you thinking?

245
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,080
It stinks!

246
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,440
<i>What</i>

247
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:41,280
<i>a great morning.</i>

248
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,840
LOST DOG FOUND

249
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,200
Hey.

250
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,240
I wonder

251
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,640
who drank with Ms. He last night.

252
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,680
I can smell the alcohol on her
from 800 miles away.

253
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:15,360
I heard she has low alcohol tolerance,

254
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,720
yet she loves to drink.

255
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:19,680
She would black out just after two beers.

256
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,760
It is normal to black out
when you are older.

257
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,280
Do youngsters nowadays

258
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,400
speak so frankly?

259
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,760
So do you always lie?

260
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,240
That's not it.

261
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,200
I can speak my mind too.

262
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,200
Stop the idle chat.

263
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,440
Get back to work.

264
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,480
Hurry.

265
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,040
Good morning, Ms. He.

266
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:11,960
Did you sleep well last night?

267
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,720
Did you sleep well last night?

268
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:20,720
Are you still drunk?

269
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:22,720
Morning.

270
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,840
<i>Don't talk about last night.</i>

271
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,560
Are you feeling dizzy?

272
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:29,680
I am fine.

273
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,720
<i>Don't talk about last night.</i>

274
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:33,800
How's your mood?

275
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,400
I am feeling great.

276
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,440
<i>Don't talk about last night.</i>

277
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,160
Then...

278
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,240
You promised me last night.

279
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,720
You promised me last night.

280
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:46,600
-You promised me last night.
-What did I promise?

281
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,000
I...

282
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,480
"I blacked out last night.
Ignore everything I said.

283
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,560
Forgive me."

284
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,920
Are you planning to say all this?

285
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,400
Do you know that making a deal

286
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:09,680
with someone who is drunk,

287
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:12,040
is considered as taking an advantage?

288
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,440
In fact,

289
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,800
you shouldn't listen to a drunk woman.

290
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,760
I thought that the drunk didn't lie.

291
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,600
All right then.

292
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,240
Repeat it.

293
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,040
As long as it is not too ridiculous,

294
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,720
I'll do whatever I can.

295
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,160
Never mind then.

296
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:49,800
Ms. He.

297
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,000
Are you done with the printer?

298
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:51,920
Yes.

299
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,320
I need to print.

300
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,680
Mr. Li said there will be a meeting.

301
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:56,840
Here.

302
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:05,840
After my 30th birthday,

303
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:08,000
I won't ever go to the club and drink,

304
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,960
or my brain will turn into mush.

305
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:15,440
My dear Su Li, you still have time
to terminate the contract.

306
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,360
My dog has become a stray dog.

307
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,440
Are you making me deal with
such little things right now?

308
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,800
<i>Yesterday, you asked
for immediate termination.</i>

309
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:22,960
You know that the dog

310
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:25,320
was my 37th birthday gift
from my older sister.

311
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,760
Do you know what
a man's 37th birthday gift

312
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:28,920
actually means?

313
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,400
It doesn't matter.

314
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,680
I am so sad that I can't even speak.

315
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:33,960
Postpone the termination.

316
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,360
Take it as good karma for the dog.

317
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,720
How many times have I told you?

318
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,960
You have to be early!

319
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:46,200
You have no time management,

320
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:47,760
but Minglu does!

321
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,360
If they terminate their contract with us,

322
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:52,840
which one of you from the marketing team
will be responsible?

323
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:55,160
Who?

324
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:59,120
Can't we just find another agency?

325
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,560
That's easy for you to say.

326
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,760
Find another one?

327
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:04,640
Do you know how many companies out there

328
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,400
that focus on newlywed homes like us,

329
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,160
are waiting for their advertising plans?

330
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,840
Is our company growing too fast for you?

331
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,800
When most of you first joined the company,

332
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,800
Amazing Decoration

333
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:20,360
is already recognized
on the newlywed's home design market,

334
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,400
and has been growing steadily.

335
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,240
But prior to that,

336
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,240
we couldn't find a good position
within the market,

337
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,880
and it was difficult to expand.

338
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:31,160
At the time, it was Minglu Advertising

339
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:34,360
who helped us create a branding strategy

340
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:37,360
and suggested we should focus
on newlywed homes.

341
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,240
It made our company stand out.

342
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,160
Now, many interior design firms

343
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,560
want to work with Minglu.

344
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,200
But they have principles.

345
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,120
They won't accept similar clients.

346
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,400
So,

347
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,040
if Minglu terminates our contract,

348
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,680
they won't be affected.

349
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,160
As for us,

350
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,480
we will be in trouble.

351
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:55,960
I'm sorry, Mr. Li.

352
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,480
It was my fault.

353
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,360
I will apologize to them.

354
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:00,920
What can your apology do?

355
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,160
If Ms. He hadn't gone yesterday,

356
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,560
all of you would've been in trouble.

357
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,160
Ms. He.

358
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:15,920
I'm sorry.

359
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,440
I caused you trouble again.

360
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,760
It was so serious, yet you said nothing.

361
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,240
I thought it was just an errand.

362
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:25,040
Also, you promised them
that you'd arrive before 2 p.m.,

363
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,160
but you didn't tell me.

364
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:27,760
I'm sorry.

365
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,680
I was too preoccupied and forgot about it.

366
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,160
Make sure this won't happen again.

367
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:33,960
I got it.

368
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,360
Ms. He.

369
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,520
How did you convince their difficult boss

370
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,000
to call off the termination?

371
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:43,920
Nothing much.

372
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,440
Their boss

373
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,960
wasn't that unreasonable either.

374
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,280
Even if you were to come on time,

375
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:54,440
I would have terminated it anyway!

376
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,000
Don't threaten me by crying.

377
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:59,720
I won't give in!

378
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,280
The contract must be terminated!

379
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,120
Can you control yourself?

380
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,680
Control yourself!

381
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:11,880
Listen to me.

382
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,600
Crying won't solve anything, right?

383
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:17,840
Fine.

384
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:18,960
No termination.

385
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,480
If you stop crying,

386
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,080
we won't terminate.

387
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,040
Is that okay?

388
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:30,880
He Fanxing.

389
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,120
I'll definitely remember you.

390
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:44,640
Come in.

391
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:48,240
Ms. He, did you ask for me?

392
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,360
Yes, take a seat.

393
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,880
I called you in for a talk

394
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,480
because your attendance for this month

395
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,560
was absolutely terrible.

396
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,400
I'll skip the nonsense.

397
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,480
We'll have to see your performance
next month.

398
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,200
Also...

399
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:31,960
Well...

400
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:35,480
If I really did promise you

401
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:38,680
something important last night,

402
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:41,800
you can tell me.

403
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:45,960
It seems like

404
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,760
you really don't remember.

405
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:52,120
Tell me about it.

406
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,600
I might be able to recall it.

407
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:57,640
You...

408
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,560
agreed to be my girlfriend.

409
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,640
That's impossible.

410
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:05,000
-A fake one.
-It's still impossible.

411
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,320
You.

412
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,280
Don't simply joke around with adults.

413
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,200
Okay?

414
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,480
Even if I was so drunk

415
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,400
that my head was in the toilet,

416
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,840
I wouldn't have agreed to that.

417
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:23,960
You told me about

418
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,320
what happened yesterday

419
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,480
and asked me to keep it a secret.

420
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,640
In exchange,

421
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:34,040
you agreed to pretend and become
something more than just friends

422
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:36,400
while we walk our dogs every night.

423
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,280
<i>Secret?</i>

424
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:40,360
Li Haomiao.

425
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:41,320
Okay.

426
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:43,320
That's enough.

427
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:47,320
<i>He Fanxing, did you fry your brain?</i>

428
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,040
I wasn't going to say it,

429
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,440
but I was taken advantage of.

430
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,480
Yesterday,

431
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,280
after pushing me to the wall,

432
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,360
you kissed me too.

433
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,440
You also said

434
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,240
that it was your first kiss

435
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,920
and told me to treasure it.

436
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,240
Hello?

437
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,680
Yes, we ordered some glasses.

438
00:29:58,600 --> 00:29:59,520
Okay.

439
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,080
Yes.

440
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:11,400
Okay.

441
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,440
Okay.

442
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,720
Isn't Yuan Song really afraid of Ms. He?

443
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:50,200
Why is he looking at her so eagerly today?

444
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,360
What else?

445
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,680
He must be asking her
to fix his attendance.

446
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,600
Touching up after office hours.

447
00:30:58,680 --> 00:30:59,800
Do you have another blind date?

448
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:01,480
It's not a blind date.

449
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:04,800
I am escaping my small social circle
to meet new friends.

450
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,280
Meet new friends?

451
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:07,280
Sure.

452
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,320
LOST DOG

453

HEFTY REWARD

454
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,400
I bet you'll return it now.

455
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:38,240
Come, baby.

456
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:40,720
Come, sit.

457
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,040
Sit.

458
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,520
Okay, stay here.

459
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,560
Don't go anywhere.

460
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:56,920
Well,

461
00:31:57,560 --> 00:32:00,640
it's not a big deal for a boy to be kissed

462
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:01,880
by someone older.

463
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,480
That's right!

464
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:04,760
It's nothing, He Fanxing.

465
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,440
You were drunk.

466
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:07,840
Don't be so awkward.

467
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,200
Don't be awkward.

468
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,200
Be open-minded.

469
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,320
LOST DOG FOUND

470
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,480
Hey, stop!

471
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,920
Don't run away!

472
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:27,640
He Fanxing.

473
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,760
You left the office so quickly.

474
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:34,480
I am in a rush to find the dog's owner.

475
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,280
Hand him over.

476
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,280
What did you call me?

477
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,200
Ms. He?

478
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:53,600
Even after work, I am still your director.

479
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,240
Understood, Ms. He.

480
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,840
How can I let my director work
when I'm here?

481
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:02,920
Just watch me.

482
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:13,560
About that...

483
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,160
Actually, yesterday...

484
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:18,640
I think it's not a big deal

485
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,640
if a boy gets kissed by an elder.

486
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,880
When I was 18, you were only 8 years old.

487
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
What's the big deal?

488
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:25,080
An elder?

489
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,080
Yes.

490
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:28,800
Since it's not a big deal,

491
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,400
why don't you kiss me again?

492
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:35,280
Never mind.

493
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,360
Since you don't remember,

494
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:40,040
I'll pretend it never happened.

495
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:48,680
Hey!

496
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,960
Wait up!

497
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:56,600
Fine.

498
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:59,000
I am a woman of my words.

499
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:02,200
Even though I believe
you are just messing around.

500
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:05,000
I am only asking you to walk the dog,
not something bad.

501
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:07,640
It will stop the girl with a poodle
in the park from bugging me.

502
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:08,760
Fine!

503
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,040
We'll only walk the dog.

504
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:11,160
Of course.

505
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,760
Don't try to make a move on me.

506
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:17,960
Brat.

507
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:21,840
LOST DOG
HEFTY REWARD

508
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,320
What?

509
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,000
Is it cold?

510
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,480
Daddy is coming for you.

511
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:47,000
You are nicely groomed.

512
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,440
Are you Ms. He?

513
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,840
Why is it you, the crybaby?

514
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,400
What a coincidence, Mr. Ye.

515
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,600
Are you here for a walk?

516
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,800
I am here for my son.

517
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,000
Your son?

518
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,800
Do you need my help?

519
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,680
I guess you don't.

520
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,680
Yesterday's clothes...

521
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:22,000
Thank you.

522
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:24,680
I'll have it cleaned
and return it to you soon.

523
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:26,960
It's fine, no rush.

524
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,720
Please do continue to look for your son.

525
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,000
I won't bother you.

526
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:32,600
Don't you want the reward?

527
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:34,560
What?

528
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:36,360
Reward?

529
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:37,760
HEFTY REWARD

530
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:44,960
You were the one...

531
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:48,600
that I called earlier.

532
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,200
What a coincidence.

533
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:54,240
Give me your account number.

534
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,480
I'll wire you the money.

535
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,280
It's fine.

536
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,440
I only did what I should.

537
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:02,440
Also, it makes me happy to find his owner.

538
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,440
I posted about the reward,

539
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,440
so you should take the money.

540
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,920
We may be work partners,

541
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:11,760
but this is a private matter.

542
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,160
Mr. Li won't know.

543
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,760
It's not about whether Mr. Li knows.

544
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:20,760
I didn't know that there was a reward,

545
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,680
so I'm not doing it for the money.

546
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:26,280
Not for the money?

547
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:27,840
Fine.

548
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,040
Give him to me.

549
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:33,720
Let's not rush this.

550
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,800
All poodles look the same.

551
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:40,160
How can you prove
that this poodle is the one you lost?

552
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:42,440
You should prove it.

553
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,080
How can I prove it?

554
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:48,200
I have raised him like a son, but...

555
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:50,600
It's not like we can do a DNA test, right?

556
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:54,160
I understand.

557
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:55,960
Give me your phone.

558
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:57,360
-My phone?
-Yes.

559
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:09,040
MY QR CODE

560
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:09,960
ADD A FRIEND

561
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:10,880
NEW FRIEND VERIFICATION

562
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,640
TRANSFER CREDIT TO YOUR FRIEND
10,000 YUAN

563
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:19,200
SUCCESSFUL

564
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:21,760
Will that do?

565
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:24,120
NAME, AMOUNT

566
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:26,520
As I already said,
I am not doing this for the money.

567
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:27,560
Yes.

568
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:29,040
It wasn't for the money.

569
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,480
I insisted on giving it to you.

570
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,320
Ms. He,

571
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:34,600
don't cross the line.

572
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,880
Is this not enough?

573
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:41,840
Mr. Ye.

574
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,560
Do you not understand what I just said?

575
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:47,320
If this dog isn't yours,

576
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,480
I won't hand it over
even if I lose my job.

577
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:50,680
Do you understand?

578
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,160
Fine.

579
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,240
I have an idea.

580
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:06,440
Dogs have their own names,
so he will know.

581
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:07,880
Call his name now.

582
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:09,600
If he runs to you,

583
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,920
then it's your dog.

584
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:16,120
You can start.

585
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:24,320
Albatross.

586
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,200
Come here.

587
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,200
Albatross.

588
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:34,560
Albatross!

589
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:36,480
Come here.

590
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,480
Albatross, come here!

591
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:45,960
Or I'll cook you!

592
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:54,360
I'm sorry, Mr. Ye.

593
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:57,440
The dress that you gave me will be sent

594
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,160
to your office tomorrow,

595
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,560
but this dog

596
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,760
is probably not yours.

597
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,280
You don't care if it's yours or not.

598
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:09,760
Since they look similar,
you assumed that it's yours.

599
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:12,400
I have met many people like you.

600
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:16,640
Love Charm!

601
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:38,120
You seem to be full of justice.

602
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:40,080
But you want both reputation

603
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:41,240
and money.

604
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:42,880
Ms. He.

605
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:44,440
I have met many people

606
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:45,760
like you.

607
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:49,640
Thank you.

608
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:51,440
Cheers

609
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:53,160
to your greedy soul.

610
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:57,800
Hey!

611
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:12,400
<i>This plan of mine</i>

612
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:15,160
<i>can satisfy the factory owner's desires</i>

613
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:16,400
<i>and help the Prince...</i>

614
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:19,480
Mom, did you wash that dress
I hung on the rack?

615
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:21,080
Dress?

616
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:23,360
No, I didn't.

617
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:26,960
Canyang took a dress from your room today.

618
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,840
He said it's for his ex-girlfriend.

619
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,600
Could that be the one?

620
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:41,600
He Canyang.

621
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:43,720
He Canyang!

622
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,040
You scared me.

623
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:52,600
I thought my drunk ex came knocking again.

624
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,240
Hey, where is my dress?

625
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:56,240
It needs to be returned tomorrow.

626
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,400
Most likely,

627
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:04,440
you won't be able to return it tomorrow.

628
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:05,960
What do you mean?

629
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,000
<i>He Canyang!</i>

630
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:21,840
<i>I'm going to ruin everything you gave me!</i>

631
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:24,800
<i>I hate him!</i>

632
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:26,840
<i>I hate him!</i>

633
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:28,640
