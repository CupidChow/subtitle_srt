1
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,240
Darling!

2
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,280
Xiaoyu!

3
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,680
-Darling.
-What?

4
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:11,840
Are you all right?

5
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,280
Let go!

6
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,720
-I'm sorry, let me go!
-Scum!

7
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,640
Scum!

8
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,520
You reap what you sow.

9
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,480
Thank goodness it's not me this time.

10
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,320
-Why are you here?
-Stop!

11
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,320
Why?

12
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,560
-Hey!
-Hey!

13
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,080
Are you sick?

14
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,320
What?

15
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,200
The baby is born?

16
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:48,560
Gosh!

17
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,880
It's a boy?

18
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,680
That's great, Xiaoyu is blessed.

19
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,400
She has a boy and a girl now.

20
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,840
Take good care of her.

21
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,840
All right!

22
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,960
That's great!

23
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,440
They're both safe.

24
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,640
-That's great.
-Gosh.

25
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,280
I wonder when we can have

26
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,160
our own grandchild.

27
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,720
I don't care if it's a boy or a girl.

28
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:17,520
Our Fanxing has such great qualities.

29
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,160
Luming is handsome.

30
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,560
They will definitely have

31
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:24,560
a clever and beautiful baby.

32
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:28,720
Looks aren't that important,
as long as the baby is healthy.

33
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,360
-Yes, the baby just has to be healthy.
-Hey.

34
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:36,240
I'll make some northern snakehead soup
and have Canyang take it to her tomorrow.

35
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,280
All right.

36
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,360
-I'll help you.
-Hurry.

37
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,360
It's so weird.

38
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,320
He seems to like you very much.

39
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,800
He stops crying once you hold him.

40
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:56,160
Song Xue is his godmother after all.

41
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,440
Here.

42
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,440
Malty.

43
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,560
Hello there.

44
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,160
I'm your godmother.

45
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,000
You look like you really like babies.

46
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,240
You should have one soon.

47
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,080
Mom!

48
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,000
Okay, I'll stop.

49
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:19,880
Here.

50
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,680
I don't want it anymore.

51
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,680
What?

52
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:32,480
Ms. He and Yuan Song were an item?

53
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,320
That's old news though.

54
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,560
Why didn't you tell me?

55
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,360
I even had a meal with them
and made fun of them.

56
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,880
It's so awkward.

57
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,720
They didn't tell anyone.

58
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,640
How could I spread the news?

59
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,800
Moreover, Mr. Ye managed to interfere,

60
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:52,120
and Yuan Song has yet to give up.

61
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,080
They're fighting dirty now.

62
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,600
Yuan Song!

63
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,480
I'm giving you this cactus.

64
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,840
Thank you. When are you leaving?

65
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,280
Once I have finished tidying up.

66
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,360
-That soon?
-Yes.

67
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,320
Won't you wait for Chang Huan?

68
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,360
Why should I?

69
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:22,320
I have gotten back with my ex-husband.

70
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,000
Ex-husband?

71
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,200
I have been rewatching <i>Naruto</i> recently.

72
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:29,680
Kakashi is my true love after all.

73
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,560
Bai.

74
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,240
Didn't you say you liked my table set?

75
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,480
It's yours now.

76
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,360
Okay.

77
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,320
Were you fired?

78
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,240
It's the opposite.

79
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,520
Aijia's admin department
only allocated one vacancy.

80
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,120
Ms. He gave it to me.

81
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,120
What about her?

82
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,760
She resigned.

83
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,320
It has been approved
and she is already handing over her tasks.

84
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,400
What's the matter?

85
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,720
Did you quit?

86
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,280
Yes.

87
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,160
You were absent yesterday,
and you're suddenly quitting today.

88
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,400
Is it because of what I said?

89
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,960
Do you hate seeing me?

90
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:45,440
My best friend gave birth yesterday.

91
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:48,640
As for my resignation,
I had thought about it for some time.

92
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:52,600
I can't be an administrator forever.

93
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:56,280
Look me in the eye and tell me
that it's not because of me.

94
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,760
What are you doing?

95
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,560
Tell me that it's not!

96
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:10,520
It's not because of you.

97
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,000
You won't see me ever again?

98
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,880
Yes, I won't.

99
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,640
Am I not even allowed
to love you one-sidedly?

100
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:30,880
You'll meet someone better for you
in the future.

101
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,520
Okay.

102
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,800
I get it now.

103
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,000
No one can see us here.

104
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,240
Here, have some water.

105
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,120
It's so refreshing.

106
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,320
How long have you been here?

107
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,360
Take this off. I'm getting hot
just from looking at you.

108
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,760
I can't. I'm still working.

109
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,880
Did you ask me to come here
to watch you work?

110
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,120
Since I have a job now,
we don't even have the time to date.

111
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:36,600
We're dating, and I miss you.

112
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,400
Give me your hand.

113
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,000
What's this for?

114
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,760
This is the first 200 yuan
I have ever made.

115
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:56,200
I'll give you and my uncle 100 yuan each.

116
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,240
Please don't mind.

117
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,640
I have thought it through.

118
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:05,160
I'll stand behind both of you
and back you up.

119
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:08,760
It's fine if either of you wants
to take a rest for a day.

120
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,920
I will be here.

121
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,520
Don't worry, I'll make lots of money

122
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,520
and buy both of you lots of things.

123
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,800
I have to get back to work.
Please put the head on me.

124
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,600
Okay.

125
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,720
-Gosh.
-I'm okay.

126
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,080
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

127
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,240
-Is everything all right?
-Yes.

128
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,920
You can go home now.
I'm going back to work.

129
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,560
-All right, get going.
-Bye.

130
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,440
Tangtang, have some more broccoli.

131
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,040
Don't just eat meat, okay?

132
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,080
Okay.

133
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,440
We're eating together,
but you look so unhappy.

134
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,840
No, I'm not.

135
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,000
Are you not happy?

136
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,240
No, I'm not.

137
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,920
Right, have you read the book I bought?

138
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:22,800
No.

139
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:26,080
Don't slack off.
You might have to take the exam soon.

140
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,120
Don't talk while you're eating.

141
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,560
You're being long-winded.

142
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:34,400
It's because I rarely get to see him.

143
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,640
How about this?

144
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,720
Move back in with us.

145
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,320
My room is big, so Yuan Song can have it.

146
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,760
I'll use the small one!

147
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,440
You love your brother the most, don't you?

148
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:47,040
Yes, he's the best!

149
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,240
I want to be like him when I grow up.

150
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,720
What are you talking about?

151
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,120
He's so disobedient.

152
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,480
Yuan Song is the best!

153
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:58,080
The teacher said that if we can pursue
our dreams without troubling others,

154
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,240
that's something admirable!

155
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:02,520
He will definitely build
a lot of beautiful houses.

156
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,720
Tangtang, I have a question.

157
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,320
What if your brother becomes poor one day?

158
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:12,200
I'll study hard
and start a business like Dad.

159
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:15,160
I'll make lots of money
and take care of him.

160
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:19,000
Tangtang, you're amazing!

161
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,320
Did you hear that?

162
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,360
Even your sister is worried that

163
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,840
she'll have to take care of you for life
if you do end up being poor.

164
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,320
That Uncle Ye you met

165
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,720
came from a poor family.

166
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,360
He fought very hard for a good life

167
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,040
and he is only finally getting married.

168
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,640
I have to leave. I have to go to the site.

169
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,120
And Dad,

170
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:47,000
I won't read the books you bought.

171
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:53,000
Tangtang, I'll pursue my dream
without troubling others.

172
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,000
I'll build pretty houses for you one day.

173
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,800
You're the best in the universe!

174
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,160
What was that about?

175
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,120
Was he challenging me?

176
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,840
Even Tangtang knows
we shouldn't cause others trouble.

177
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,760
Why can't you be more sensible?

178
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,520
Couldn't you see how upset he was?

179
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,600
You still mentioned Ye Luming.

180
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:24,160
That's strange.
Why can't I ever mention Ye Luming?

181
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,520
He Fanxing has resigned.

182
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,800
She resigned?

183
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,680
Is she getting married?

184
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,640
She should work at Luming's company.

185
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,920
That's even weirder.

186
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,480
How does this affect Yuan Song?

187
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,240
Why was he so agitated?

188
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,240
Yuan Song likes He Fanxing.

189
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,320
Doesn't he still like his ex?

190
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,720
Are you stupid?

191
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,440
<i>Say something.</i>

192
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:56,240
<i>This is making me very awkward.</i>

193
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,080
<i>What should I say?</i>

194
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,120
<i>Do you want me to recommend him
some hair growth serum?</i>

195
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,400
<i>I have done my best,
but he has too much hair.</i>

196
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,600
<i>He's only partly bald.</i>

197
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,080
Professor Song, look.

198
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,680
Malty has his mom's eyes!

199
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,160
Darling, look!

200
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,520
He has your eyes and my nose.

201
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,760
Is that so?

202
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,040
Isn't it time for you to go to work?

203
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,640
<i>I feel disgusted whenever I see him.</i>

204
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,880
-Xiaoyu.
-Fanxing, let me.

205
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,640
My dad made you some soup.

206
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,240
He's the best.

207
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,240
Is there a lot? I want some.

208
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,200
-He made you some as well.
-Thank you!

209
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,280
That's great.

210
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,280
When will you go to the care center?

211
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:46,120
They'll be picking me up tomorrow.

212
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,440
-Nice.
-Try it.

213
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,760
Well then, I'm off to work.

214
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:53,960
It's good.

215
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,000
This one is yours.

216
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,720
Careful, it's hot.

217
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,720
The moment I came in, I immediately felt

218
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,120
the tension in the air.

219
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:18,000
Why should we be the ones
who feel awkward?

220
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,440
That's because he is shameless
and we are not.

221
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,320
Right, Fanxing.

222
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:27,240
Have you consulted a lawyer for me?

223
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,720
I have asked my client who is a lawyer.

224
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,920
She specializes in divorce cases.

225
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,200
According to her, for your situation,

226
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,960
it is difficult for you
to get the custody of Peanut.

227
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,320
It's because you're unemployed.

228
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:45,040
But don't worry, I have a plan.

229
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:48,400
My resignation has been approved.

230
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,280
We can open a flower shop.

231
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,880
Did you really resign?

232
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:52,920
Yes.

233
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,160
I can't be an administrator forever.

234
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,920
I should start a business
while I'm still young.

235
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,480
I also have quite a bit of money
saved over the years.

236
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:05,320
Moreover, Mr. Li promised to apply
for a severance package for me.

237
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,800
This plan is pretty good.

238
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,280
You used to work as a florist
back in college.

239
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,360
Yes.

240
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,280
I have even signed up
for a florist course.

241
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,400
It will start next week.

242
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,800
You can attend the course
after you have recovered.

243
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,880
You really have everything planned out,

244
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,680
even for me.

245
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,120
Of course.

246
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,680
I can't just support
your divorce verbally.

247
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,840
How about it? Does it sound good to you?

248
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,200
Of course...

249
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,600
I have no problems with it.

250
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,120
It's just that

251
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:36,280
I've spent a lot of money on the kids.

252
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,360
I don't have much savings left.

253
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,120
Hey.

254
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,880
You forgot about me.

255
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,840
I'm the one with the most money
among the three of us.

256
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,960
Just count me in your business.

257
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:56,160
The two of you will work
while I'll be a silent partner.

258
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,400
How about that?

259
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,120
You're so rich!

260
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,600
It's just so-so.

261
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,280
What are you talking about so happily?

262
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,760
-I could hear you from outside.
-You're here, Ye.

263
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,720
Fruits for a beauty.

264
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,480
Thank you.

265
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,280
Hey.

266
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:21,800
Goodness, it's really thick.

267
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,320
Hey.

268
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,160
Isn't it improper to open it
in front of the giver?

269
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,880
Ye isn't an outsider.

270
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:34,240
Ten thousand yuan!

271
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:39,600
And one yuan.

272
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:45,200
Your baby is one in a million,
hence the amount.

273
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,200
Really?

274
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,080
Yes.

275
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,760
Did we really get the homestay project?

276
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,920
It is thousands of square feet!

277
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,960
Yes, it is.

278
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:09,960
Here.

279
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,640
Be careful of the stitches.

280
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:16,599
What a fool.

281
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:19,280
Pain is good.

282
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,440
Or else, I would think I was dreaming.

283
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:27,400
We actually outperformed
the renowned designers from Shenzhen.

284
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,600
Looking at it from another perspective,

285
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,160
it could be due to our low price.

286
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,360
Thank you for the red packet.

287
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,400
Don't mention it.

288
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,160
There's no need to be courteous
with each other.

289
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:51,320
While we're dating each other,
you have spent plenty of money.

290
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:55,720
You bought me gifts
and gave my friends money.

291
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,560
You have given too much.

292
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,480
Therefore, as a way to return the favor,

293
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:03,280
you should quickly fall
madly in love with me

294
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:06,360
and declare that
you can't live without me.

295
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,720
Okay, I understand.

296
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:09,840
I'll try my best.

297
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,000
Okay.

298
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,240
Keep it up then.

299
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,080
Yes, I'll work hard.

300
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,720
Aren't you visiting another friend
on the 14th floor?

301
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:22,440
I should go.

302
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:25,000
I have to meet an important client
at the office.

303
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,480
Okay, bye.

304
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,640
Ms. He!

305
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,480
Mr. Ye, you're here too.

306
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,600
Hey.

307
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:34,360
Her best friend just gave birth,
so I came to visit.

308
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,800
I have to go.
Let's have a meal another time.

309
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,760
-Okay, bye.
-Bye.

310
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,320
Why are you being so awkward?

311
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,720
You didn't do anything wrong.

312
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:53,400
But it feels like I did.

313
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,960
I never would have imagined

314
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:58,360
that you and Yuan Song dated.

315
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,120
We weren't a good match, right?

316
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:05,520
I'm nearly hitting middle age,
while he's still young.

317
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:08,200
That's what I thought at first.

318
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,200
Then I realized
there was nothing wrong with that.

319
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:13,360
If men can find girls
who are 10 or 20 years younger than them,

320
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,000
why can't women do the same?

321
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:21,680
But you're seeing Mr. Ye now.

322
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:25,240
You don't have any feelings left
for Yuan Song, right?

323
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,200
I knew it.

324
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,960
We don't have a choice.

325
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:35,880
Women have to be realistic.

326
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:40,720
As for Mr. Ye,
in every aspect regarding marriage,

327
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,440
he is better than Yuan Song.

328
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,720
All right, let's go.

329
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,360
You look too calm.

330
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:54,680
Are guys like you this pretentious?

331
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:59,120
Gosh, this is my first time
getting such a big project.

332
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:02,640
I can already feel the money rushing in.

333
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,880
I'm happy as well.

334
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,960
Then try to smile, at least.

335
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:10,360
When I saw you, I thought we screwed up.

336
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:12,960
Right.

337
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:16,200
For the reconstruction,
we have to work with an architect.

338
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,680
We can hire someone first.

339
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,360
After I have completed my studies abroad
and become an architect,

340
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,480
I'll do it myself.

341
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:25,920
If you're going to study abroad,
how can you court Ms. He?

342
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:28,800
Forget it.

343
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:29,840
She has resigned.

344
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,560
Resigned?

345
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,440
Yes.

346
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:37,720
She won't see me anymore.

347
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,680
This is the room.

348
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,400
I'm going to the site.

349
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,920
Are you feeling better?

350
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Yes, it's nothing serious.

351
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,400
I can leave tomorrow.

352
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,760
That's good.

353
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,680
-Ms. He.
-Yes?

354
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:13,880
Yuan Song said...

355
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,720
that you have resigned.

356
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,080
Resigned?

357
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:18,880
Why?

358
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,720
I didn't make the decision just recently.

359
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,440
I've thought about it for a long time.

360
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:27,240
I am done with being an administrator.

361
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:29,760
I plan to open a flower shop
with my best friends.

362
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:31,840
That's good.

363
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,520
You do like flowers a lot.

364
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:34,600
Yes.

365
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,200
But it feels too sudden.

366
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:40,200
We will be without
your supervision and discipline.

367
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:42,960
It feels like our strict class teacher

368
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,600
has suddenly announced her retirement.

369
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:46,920
Don't worry.

370
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:50,400
I may have resigned,
but it doesn't mean we won't meet again.

371
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:53,080
You have to visit my shop often.

372
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,000
All right.

373
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:57,000
Although I need to save money
to buy a bigger house,

374
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,720
I'll still sign up for a membership.

375
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,520
Thank you, my dear customer.

376
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,840
Why do you want to move to another house?

377
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,440
Are you getting pompous?

378
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:08,880
A two-room house can't satisfy
an active monkey like you anymore?

379
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,760
I heard you would only stay
in a 2,000-square-feet house.

380
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,120
So I have to be better than her.

381
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,600
That's just a rumor.

382
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,480
I have never said that.

383
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
My requirements have never changed.

384
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,280
The guy has to be rich and likable.

385
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:28,120
The standard of wealth
is actually pretty vague.

386
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:29,960
If I don't like him,

387
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,800
I wouldn't marry him
even if he was a billionaire.

388
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,720
If I like him, I would marry him

389
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,200
even if he only has tens of thousands.

390
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,600
I do have that much!

391
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,400
But I don't like you.

392
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,160
Then why do you keep visiting me?

393
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,560
I like your mom.

394
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:42,680
She's nice.

395
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,720
I am here to chat with her.

396
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,720
Although we're no longer colleagues,

397
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:52,520
as your friend,

398
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,280
I'll be sure to attend your wedding.

399
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,760
I am not marrying him!

400
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,120
Then why are you trying
to be closer to my mom?

401
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,480
I don't even have a brother.

402
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,760
You talk too much!

403
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,240
I'm injured. Be careful!

404
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,680
It hurts!

405
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,360
-I'm warning you.
-I'm done.

406
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:13,920
Yes.

407
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,440
That's right.

408
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,920
Yes.

409
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,720
I have prepared a transfer report.

410
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,240
All right.

411
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,040
Thank you for your help.

412
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:26,640
All right.

413
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,960
Thank you very much.

414
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:33,400
You were doing so well.
Why are you transferring?

415
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,480
The art institute pays more.

416
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,560
-Mom.
-What?

417
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:51,720
Would it be bad if I had a girlfriend

418
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,320
who is younger than me?

419
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:58,760
You talk as if the girls you dated
were all older than you.

420
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,440
That's not what I meant.

421
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,720
I'm talking about someone

422
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:07,280
who is 12 years younger than me.

423
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,280
Save it.

424
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,440
Is it not good?

425
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,720
What do you think?

426
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:19,160
We have enough issues.

427
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,200
Your dad and I are old.

428
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:23,040
We won't be able to handle it.

429
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,360
But doesn't our family

430
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:31,040
value personal freedom greatly?

431
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:38,200
Our family upholds
public order and social norms.

432
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:41,080
But having a younger girlfriend

433
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:44,840
doesn't break the public order
or social norms, right?

434
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:52,520
Have you really found someone this young?

435
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:57,760
No!

436
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,160
No, of course not.

437
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:03,920
That would be for the best.

438
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:06,480
If you really did,

439
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,560
then don't even think of coming back here.

440
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,840
Your dad went for a walk.

441
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,200
Why isn't he back yet?

442
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:21,680
Give him a call right now.

443
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,080
What is he doing?

444
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,760
He forgot his phone again.

445
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,480
Your dad

446
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:42,000
might really get himself lost one day.

447
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:43,960
Goodness.

448
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,200
This is just an illusion you feel

449
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:55,280
after falling out of love with discontent.

450
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:58,200
It's the aftermath of love.

451
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,800
Think about it.

452
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,960
You don't actually like her.

453
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:04,080
You just want to get her back.

454
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:07,120
It's like having beers.

455
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,200
You don't really want to drink.

456
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,960
You just want the beer snacks.

457
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,120
Whenever I drink,

458
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,760
it's because I really want to.

459
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,160
Not necessarily.

460
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:19,280
Try giving it more thought.

461
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,720
If you win her back,

462
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:25,120
she might look pretty now,

463
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,560
but how about two years later?

464
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:30,320
When her collagen levels are depleted,
she will be an old lady.

465
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:33,000
Can a young man like you handle it?

466
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,880
If you're going to dump her eventually,

467
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:39,200
you should just let her go now.

468
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,840
I like the fact

469
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:46,640
that she is an innocent woman
who stood the test of time.

470
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:48,560
Her soul radiates such brightness.

471
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:52,120
Even when she is old and full of wrinkles,

472
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:55,720
she will always be beautiful in my eyes.

473
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:59,160
You are disgusting.

474
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,240
What's the use of telling me that?

475
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:04,760
She's dating Ye Luming,
and he has my parents' approval.

476
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,440
And she has resigned now.

477
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:08,640
You won't see her as often.

478
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,560
I'm telling you this as a friend.
Let go when you should.

479
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:12,680
Don't dwell on it.

480
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,400
Hey...

481
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:22,600
That's enough.

482
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,800
You're acting like a girl.

483
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:33,120
Even if you're right, I still like her.

484
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,640
So what if I like her?

485
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,040
All right.

486
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,760
Do as you please.

487
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:44,120
You're a young man who cries for love.

488
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,720
How admirable.

489
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,640
Mom, I'm back.

490
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,200
You're back.

491
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,160
Xingxing,

492
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,600
your dad is not home yet.

493
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:07,160
-Did he go out?
-He did.

494
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:09,680
He went out this morning
and forgot his phone.

495
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,480
He's not back yet.

496
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,760
He's not?

497
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:14,920
-No.
-Did he call?

498
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,360
No, he didn't.

499
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:18,920
Things should be fine.

500
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,280
Maybe he went somewhere else for a walk.

501
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:25,000
But he still hasn't returned.

502
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,960
He should at least call.

503
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:31,160
Could something have happened to your dad?

504
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:33,920
Did he say where he was going?
I'll look for him.

505
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,560
He said he was going to the park.

506
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,320
I'll change and go with you.

507
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,880
Mom, you should stay here.

508
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,760
Wait here in case Dad comes back.

509
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,640
Call me if he's back.

510
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,320
Calm down, he'll come back.

511
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:48,040
-Call me once you have found him.
-Okay, I'm going now.

512
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,520
Hello, Canyang, where are you?

513
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:04,800
Stop.

514
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,320
That's my dad.

515
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,080
He was there around 1:00 p.m.

516
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,840
He always uses the south gate.

517
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,640
Please check when he left.

518
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,920
Can you fast forward?

519
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:43,680
Mr. Liu, have you seen my dad today?

520
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,400
-No.
-You haven't?

521
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,240
Thank you.

522
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,120
Why are you here?

523
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,160
I was with Professor He when you called.

524
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:02,160
-Where is he?
-He's checking the CCTV footage.

525
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,320
Something must have happened.

526
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:11,360
Calm down. No news is good news right now.

527
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,280
Okay?

528
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:18,320
There are drowning incidents here
every once in a while.

529
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,200
My dad likes to walk by the lake.

530
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,440
He can't swim.

531
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,360
Don't worry. There's no such news yet.

532
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,240
Don't think only of bad things, okay?

533
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:32,480
-How did it go?
-So?

534
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:34,040
The dog is with security.

535
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:36,840
The CCTV footage at the south gate
showed that Dad never left.

536
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,480
Calm down!

537
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:44,480
The CCTV at the west gate is out.
Dad might have left from there.

538
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,640
But he always uses the south gate.

539
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,760
Something must have happened.

540
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:52,480
Something must have happened!

541
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,080
Let's go to the police.

542
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,400
-The police!
-All right, let's go.

543
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:58,920
You have to file a report.

544
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,120
-Okay.
-This way.

545
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,520
He Fanxing.

546
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:19,360
How can you go home looking like this?

547
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,360
I'm scared.

548
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:33,760
If something happened to him,
what's going to happen to my mom?

549
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:36,040
What will I do?

550
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,120
Mrs. He is alone at home.

551
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:42,800
She must be scared too.

552
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,320
Go back to her.

553
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:47,360
She needs someone with her right now.

554
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,400
You need to keep it together.

555
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,880
We have to prepare for the worst.

556
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:56,720
If...

557
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,760
If something happened,

558
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:01,160
you have to be there for your mom.

559
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,600
Have you found him?

560
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,360
Don't worry, we'll find him.

561
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,840
I'm here. Don't worry.

562
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,880
Go be with Mrs. He.

563
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:32,000
I'll wait here with Professor He.

564
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:37,440
Thank you.

565
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,680
Don't mention it.

566
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:54,840
You're back!

567
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,600
Mom...

568
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:13,960
We'll find Dad. Don't worry.

569
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:30,280
-Look over there.
-Over there.

570
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:38,800
Something is floating here.
It looks like a body. Come here!

571
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:45,000
Come on.

572
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:48,360
Gosh.

573
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,000
No.

574
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,080
Wait.

575
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,159
Hello, Canyang?

576
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:26,920
In the lake...

577
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:30,520
It's not him?

578
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:33,600
Okay, come home first.

579
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:42,560
Someone fell into the lake a few days ago.

580
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:45,360
The body

581
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:49,960
only emerged after a while.

582
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,639
Mom!

583
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,400
You haven't slept.

584
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:57,080
Don't think too much.

585
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:02,440
We must be mentally prepared.

586
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:06,120
A big man

587
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,960
vanished just like that.

588
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:14,320
I want to see him,

589
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:17,840
dead or alive!

590
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:20,960
That's nonsense. Am I not here?

591
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:26,880
Luming, you're here too.

592
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,920
I'm hungry. Is breakfast ready?

593
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,200
Qingfeng!

594
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:37,000
Where have you been?

595
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:39,040
Are you trying to make us go crazy?

596
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,240
-Dad!
-My dear daughter.

597
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,760
Where were you?
We looked for you everywhere!

598
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,040
It's all right now.

599
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:46,240
Canyang is looking for you by the lake.

600
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,400
We thought you fell in the lake.

601
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:51,040
It's all right. I came back alive!

602
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:53,560
Call Canyang. He can stop searching.

603
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:56,000
Right, I'll call him.

604
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:58,080
-There, there.
-I'll call him.

605
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,840
Slow down.

606
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:07,840
I told you that
you'd get yourself lost someday.

607
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:10,320
And you really got lost.

608
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:13,960
Mr. He, slow down.

609
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:17,320
Goodness.

610
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,800
I have no idea what happened.

611
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:25,960
I just couldn't find the way back home
no matter what.

612
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:29,320
I even forgot my own name.

613
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:32,000
I was confused.

614
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:35,000
I couldn't even talk.

615
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:39,520
I kept on walking and walking.

616
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:41,800
I was looking for my way home.

617
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:45,760
Then, I got sleepy.

618
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,520
So I went to sleep

619
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:49,640
in the boathouse.

620
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,520
Mr. He, you should get some rest.

621
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,560
I'll register him at the hospital.

622
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:57,120
I'll take him for a checkup
this afternoon.

623
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,360
There's no need.

624
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:01,080
You stayed up all night. Go back and rest.

625
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,960
Canyang is home anyway.

626
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,480
That's right.

627
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:08,160
You should rest as well
and go to work if you can.

628
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:11,240
Canyang doesn't have work today.
He'll handle it.

629
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,280
All right.

630
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:15,760
If you need anything, just call me.

631
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:17,480
-Okay.
-It's fine.

632
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:19,080
Don't worry.

633
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:21,080
If I'm sick, then so be it.

634
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,480
I'll listen to the doctors.

635
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:25,760
Let's eat. Eat up.

636
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,640
Dad!

637
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,800
Dad!

638
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,840
Dad, where have you been?

639
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,000
I was so scared
when they said someone fell in the lake!

640
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,920
Don't cry!

641
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,640
Which heartless monster

642
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,520
threw a mannequin in the lake?

643
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:48,760
Don't cry!

644
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,680
Come on, stop crying.

645
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,560
Don't cry.

646
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:03,360
Why are you crying too?

647
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:05,720
I couldn't hold it in!

648
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:08,080
All right, don't cry.

649
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,000
Stop crying!

650
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:12,520
You're making me cry as well!

651
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:14,120
Goodness!

652
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:16,080
Look at you!

653
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:23,040
It's all right, get back inside.

654
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,360
That won't do.

655
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:26,040
I have to thank you.

656
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:27,600
I'm glad you were here.

657
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,520
My mom could be at ease for a bit.

658
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:34,120
So? How did I do as your boyfriend?

659
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,240
You were excellent.

660
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,360
Don't worry.

661
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:42,440
If you haven't picked out your house,
I'll accompany you.

662
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:45,960
Are there any real rewards?

663
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:49,680
What would you like? I'll buy it for you.

664
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:52,760
I'll help myself.

665
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:02,360
I'll go now.

666
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:05,480
Give me a call after the checkup.

667
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:07,000
All right.

668
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:00,560
There are no bruises on the head.

669
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:04,800
Your symptoms meet
the early signs of Alzheimer's.

670
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:07,720
The progression differs from
person to person.

671
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:11,240
It might take years or decades
to reach the later stages.

672
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:14,160
Some just take months.

673
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:15,920
Doctor.

674
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:18,080
At later stages,

675
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:21,440
will he not recognize
or remember anyone anymore?

676
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:24,120
Yes, but that's not the worst.

677
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:27,840
He will lose the ability
to look after himself.

678
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:37,560
Doctor, can you

679
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,520
give me any medication

680
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:42,720
so that I'd turn senile slower?

681
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:44,880
Of course, sir.

682
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:48,120
Early medication can control the symptoms.

683
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:52,160
No matter what disease it is,
a good mentality is the best medicine.

684
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:54,520
Yes, you're right.

685
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,840
The doctor said

686
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:14,800
it can be controlled.

687
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:18,760
Then again,

688
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:20,400
it progresses differently

689
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:23,000
from person to person.

690
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:27,960
Don't worry.

691
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:35,720
<i>When I was 12 years old,</i>

692
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:38,160
<i>I experienced growing pains.</i>

693
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:40,880
<i>My body grew too fast,</i>

694
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:42,720
<i>and my skin stretched itself thin.</i>

695
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:45,760
<i>My muscles and bones
felt like they were being torn.</i>

696
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:50,640
<i>My body resisted rapid growth with pain.</i>

697
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,520
<i>We're now 32 years old.</i>

698
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:55,840
<i>We grew up overnight.</i>

699
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:58,960
<i>We're facing severe growing pains again.</i>

700
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:02,400
<i>It's 10,000 times more painful</i>

701
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:04,200
<i>than when I was 12.</i>

702
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:07,520
<i>The pain is simply unbearable.</i>

703
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:12,160
<i>It reminds me that</i>

704
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:17,760
<i>as we are willfully wasting our time,</i>

705
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:20,600
<i>our parents</i>

706
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:24,200
<i>don't have much time left</i>

707
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:25,680
<i>to be wasted.</i>

708
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:26,560
