1
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:07,800
Your dog should be castrated,
so that it will stop harming others.

2
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,759
My friend's dog was going to be neutered,

3
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,080
but you stopped me.

4
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,680
-But--
-It's okay.

5
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,400
It is probably done by now.

6
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,640
You got what you wanted.

7
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,800
You're ridiculous!

8
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:32,840
I'm sorry.

9
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,640
I just sent my client back.

10
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,240
Are you okay?

11
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,160
I'm fine.

12
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,640
Sorry, I should have been here sooner.

13
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,080
I should be the one to apologize.

14
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,080
I even failed to take care of a dog.

15
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,040
No.

16
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,160
Don't say that.

17
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:52,120
Though I am surprised that you spent
an entire afternoon with the police.

18
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,880
I should be the one apologizing.

19
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,240
I have always thought
that I'm good at handling situations.

20
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,480
But I seem to be better

21
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,280
at making things worse instead.

22
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,800
SHANGHAI PUBLIC SECURITY BUREAU

23
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,120
LINHAI ROAD

24
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,000
There seems to be something else
behind those words.

25
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,800
Did you fight with your boyfriend?

26
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,440
That's a good thing.

27
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,600
But I don't think it's good to be sad.

28
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:35,880
Then let's analyze the reasons
on why a couple fights, okay?

29
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,560
It is because two souls

30
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,160
are expecting each other to understand

31
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,640
their own thoughts and feelings.

32
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,520
So of course,
there would be a clash of opinions.

33
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,520
But look at it another way.

34
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:52,120
Only stagnant water stays calm and still.

35
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,040
But an active and lively spring

36
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,120
should be

37
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:00,560
gentle like the rustling wind,

38
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,600
and sometimes violent like

39
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,560
a stormy downpour hitting calm water.

40
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:05,920
Is it not?

41
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,000
I think the nature of love

42
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:14,040
is two people finding happiness together.

43
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,200
And then?

44
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,040
What is there beyond happiness?

45
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:19,920
More happiness?

46
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,800
Or is it bliss?

47
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,080
And more bliss?

48
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,760
Actually, it's fear.

49
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,120
The happier you are, the more you fear.

50
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,920
You fear losing it,

51
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,800
which then leads you
to feeling sadness and pain.

52
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,520
So are you saying...

53
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,880
that I'm feeling insecure?

54
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,960
Only those who possess love

55
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,440
would be scared to lose it.

56
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,680
Even if it is lost,

57
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,720
they can still enjoy the memories.

58
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,560
But the kind of love
that leaves you hanging?

59
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,520
That is unrequited love.

60
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,000
He Fanxing.

61
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:11,640
You have a boyfriend
and you get into fights with him.

62
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,920
Yet you ask me, a single guy,
to comfort and encourage you.

63
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,160
Are you serious?

64
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,480
I guess you are right.

65
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,160
Hearing you say that,

66
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,800
I guess you do seem more pitiful.

67
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,880
I feel better now.

68
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,760
You really are ungrateful.

69
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,560
Let's go.

70
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,400
I'll buy you dinner for all the trouble.

71
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,240
I can't.

72
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,600
I need to have dinner at home today.

73
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,000
I rarely eat at home nowadays,

74
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,440
so my parents are acting up.

75
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:59,160
They even prepared a feast
for me this morning.

76
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,680
Okay, I'll drive you home.

77
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,120
Wait.

78
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,640
We have to walk a bit.

79
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,240
I had to park somewhere far.

80
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:10,680
The person we met
at your neighborhood last time...

81
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,080
Was it Mrs. Wang?

82
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,040
She thought I was your boyfriend.

83
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,440
It can't be.

84
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,360
I've already explained everything to her.

85
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,640
To these busybodies,

86
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,800
an explanation seems like a cover.

87
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,240
Meet them once

88
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,120
and they would think
that you're getting married.

89
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,600
Meet them twice?

90
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,400
They would think
that you're having a shotgun marriage.

91
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,600
What nonsense.

92
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,520
Come on.

93
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,560
-Mr. He.
-Yes.

94
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,800
Let's go to the park together.

95
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,280
You can go first. I'll be there later.

96
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,360
-Okay, I'll get going then.
-Okay.

97
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,480
Hey, you're home.

98
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,400
-Dad.
-Yes.

99
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,680
Why are you here?

100
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:03,440
Did you just arrive home
from walking the dog or are you leaving?

101
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,120
I just came back.

102
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,480
Hey, don't just stand here.

103
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,120
Hurry up and go back now.

104
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,040
Your mom has finished preparing dinner.

105
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,760
Did you really just get back?

106
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,120
Yes!

107
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,360
Didn't I tell you
not to walk Baylor alone?

108
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,600
He's very strong.

109
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,920
What if he suddenly ran
and pulled you along, making you fall?

110
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,960
He was dying to come out.

111
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,640
He had to pee and sniff around.

112
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,600
Give him to me.

113
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:28,840
-Come on.
-All right.

114
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:29,800
Let's go.

115
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,640
Come on, Baylor.

116
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,200
So that's my father-in-law.

117
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:05,960
Ms. He.

118
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,240
Here.

119
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:10,760
Ms. He.

120
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,640
Yuan Song's future girlfriend
is in the meeting room.

121
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,720
Future girlfriend?

122
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:21,200
She came yesterday,
asking him to design her apartment.

123
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,320
She's pretty young.

124
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,920
He said she's just a junior
from the university,

125
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,880
but I don't buy that.

126
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,000
No way it's that simple.

127
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,640
When the girl looks at him,

128
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:30,320
her eyes become as bright
as the twinkling stars.

129
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,560
How nice.

130
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,600
Just looking at this scene,

131
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,000
makes one feel
as if they're looking at a painting.

132
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,480
I think they're just talking about work.

133
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,360
Goodness, Ms. He.

134
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,880
Of course, they are.

135
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:15,000
But who says that you can't charm a guy
while working together on something?

136
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:18,000
The girl is from a wealthy family.

137
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,880
Her apartment was a birthday gift
from her uncle.

138
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,800
The renovation will require
at least two months

139
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,120
and they will meet frequently.

140
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:31,600
It's a piece of cake
for a girl to court a boy.

141
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,280
Yuan Song won't be able to resist.

142
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,840
I bet 500 yuan that he will fall for her
within those 2 months.

143
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,440
I bet 1,000 yuan that he won't.

144
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,680
Ms. He, you're giving me free money.

145
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,960
I don't get it.

146
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,560
Can't a guy and a girl
have a platonic relationship?

147
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,200
Can't they just be friends?

148
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,080
They could also be like a pair of twins.

149
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,440
What kind of guy and girl
would be like that?

150
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,440
My brother and I.

151
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,560
Stop watching.

152
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,600
What about your work?

153
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,000
Don't you want to get paid?

154
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,160
Yuan Song and Ms. Cai, are you done?

155
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,880
Ms. Cai, are you happy with our designer?

156
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,280
I am.

157
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,600
I really am.

158
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:29,880
Not to boast or anything,
but his designs spoke to me.

159
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,920
By the way,
you don't have to call me Ms. Cai.

160
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,240
I'm Cai Minmin, my friends call me Melon.

161
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,840
Melon?

162
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,160
How cute!

163
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,960
-Ms. Bai.
-Yes?

164
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,440
-I'm going to take a look at the site.
-Okay, off you go.

165
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,360
-Goodbye, miss.
-Bye.

166
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:46,640
Bye.

167
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,680
The apartment is quite small,

168
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,760
but the university
is just across the road.

169
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:06,320
Zhanni and I can finally leave the dorms.

170
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,120
It's only 47 square meters
without the common area,

171
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,160
but it's tall enough.

172
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,880
Both of you will need wardrobes
and cabinets of your own.

173
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,080
I'll split the space into two layers.

174
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,720
This will let in more sunlight
and add 20 square meters to the total.

175
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,200
Okay, you make the call.

176
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,560
But how soon can it be done?

177
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:28,120
Starting from today,
you can move in after Chinese New Year.

178
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,320
Didn't you already pay your dormitory fee?

179
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,240
What?

180
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,600
It needs another six months?

181
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,080
Don't be impatient.

182
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,600
It takes two months to air out the place.

183
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:40,560
I would rather breathe in the formaldehyde
over the gloom of the dorm.

184
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:42,760
Hello.

185
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,600
I am your next-door neighbor.

186
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,320
I wanted to greet you.

187
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,800
-Do you live next door?
-Yes.

188
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,000
Nice to meet you.

189
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,560
-Have you started renovating?
-No.

190
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,640
My boyfriend is checking it with someone.

191
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:54,800
What about you?

192
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,360
We're starting immediately.

193
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,400
Is this your newlywed house as well?

194
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,760
-No.
-No, I'm a designer.

195
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:08,920
She is just my client
and I am here to survey her home.

196
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,440
This is our business card.

197
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,480
Feel free to contact us
for a consultation.

198
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,400
I am sorry for the misunderstanding,

199
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:23,360
but your designer is very handsome.

200
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,040
I'll be going. See you!

201
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,280
Goodbye.

202
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,040
Cong Xiao, let's go for lunch.

203
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,640
-Sure, give me a minute.
-Okay.

204
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:39,000
Cong Xiao is having lunch with me.

205
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,840
I'm afraid you'll have to go without her.

206
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:42,960
Okay.

207
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,520
Then I'll be going alone.

208
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,200
Let's go.

209
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,440
Are you only treating me to dumplings

210
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,280
for introducing you to such a good catch?

211
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,160
You should be grateful.

212
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,320
Now, spill.

213
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,600
What's going on?

214
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,760
You don't greet me when we see each other

215
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,520
and you pretend not to see me at times.

216
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:17,240
Even if we are no longer friends,
we are still colleagues.

217
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,040
This will affect work.

218
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,320
Tell me.

219
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,480
How did I offend you?

220
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,560
You didn't.

221
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,320
It's not you.

222
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:30,240
I just can't help
but feel jealous right now.

223
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,560
Jealous?

224
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,040
Of me?

225
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,080
Why me out of all people?

226
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,400
I clearly told you that I became friends

227
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,560
with the guy you introduced me to.

228
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,000
Aren't you supposed to know that?

229
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,440
Why do you keep saying that we're dating?

230
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,320
Do you know how much
it has affected me at work?

231
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,480
What did you say?

232
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,680
Just friends?

233
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:52,840
What's wrong with that?

234
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,360
Can't men and women stay as friends?

235
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,320
Who said otherwise?

236
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,280
The law?

237
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:57,800
There's nothing wrong with that.

238
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,280
Of course, you can.

239
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:00,920
Have some tea.

240
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,240
Please calm down.

241
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:03,840
Here.

242
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,640
Don't be angry.

243
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,760
Anyway, it is all my fault.

244
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,080
A thousand apologies.

245
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,680
I was too narrow-minded.

246
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,640
Excuse me.

247
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:14,880
Thank you.

248
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:15,880
Enjoy your meal.

249
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,960
I was going to forget about it
and move on,

250
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:23,240
but who knew that you and T-Rex
aren't even together!

251
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,560
Why didn't you tell me?

252
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,480
I was upset over nothing then.

253
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,880
Of course, we're not dating.

254
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:32,680
Didn't your friend tell you?

255
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,160
I guess she misunderstood.

256
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,760
So?

257
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,720
Are you trying to say

258
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,960
that you regretted setting me up with him
after you saw him?

259
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,160
But then you should know
that I am not one to blame.

260
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,120
You couldn't blame me,
yet you didn't want to talk to me.

261
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,080
Am I right?

262
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,280
The brilliant Ms. He.

263
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,000
You saw through my petty mind right away.

264
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:58,800
Can't we just be open between us?

265
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,240
I was struggling too.

266
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,320
I wanted to be happy for you,

267
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:07,000
but I also felt sorry for myself
for letting a chance slip by.

268
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,760
The chance has slipped by regardless.

269
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,560
He has someone he likes.

270
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,560
It's an unrequited love
and he is completely smitten.

271
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,280
The blind date was for his family's sake.

272
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:21,560
Doesn't that mean that he is still single?

273
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,600
Ms. He, is this how you treat a friend?

274
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,160
Tell me more about him.

275
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,600
Not today.

276
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,400
-I'm not in the mood.
-Okay.

277
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,480
I'll wait until you're in the mood then.

278
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:36,760
Let's eat.

279
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:39,400
These dumplings look so appetizing!

280
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,400
How tasty.

281
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,720
<i>When we fall in love,</i>

282
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,040
<i>our IQ declines</i>

283
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,600
<i>and we become stupid.</i>

284
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,400
<i>We suspect each other.</i>

285
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,080
<i>Everyone becomes our rival.</i>

286
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:00,760
<i>Sometimes, it's just all in our head.</i>

287
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,600
<i>No one is secretly conspiring against you.</i>

288
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,320
<i>"Lower her guard."</i>

289
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,280
<i>"Dog eats the gauze."</i>

290
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,120
<i>"Neuter the dog."</i>

00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,320

00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:17,440
FATHER-IN-LAW

<i>"Father-in-law."</i>

<i>We are the only heroes of our own lives.</i>

296

<i>Nobody cares enough to watch you.</i>

297
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,800
<i>An orange candy,</i>

298
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,200
<i>a bouquet,</i>

299

<i>or a card.</i>

300

<i>There aren't that many truths to uncover,</i>

301
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:49,160

<i>Relax.</i>

304
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:03,080
<i>Just enjoy the fun
of a secret love affair.</i>

305
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,000

YUAN SONG

308
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,080
Wait!

309
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,720
What now?

310
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:37,920
Are we not on talking terms?

311
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,240
I am currently off work.

312
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,920
I don't want to hear any lectures
from my boss.

313
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,840
I'm not lecturing anyone.

314
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,400
I'm just trying to solve the problem.

315
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,320
There's nothing to be solved.

316
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,920
You only became friends
with your blind date.

317
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,720
You're not required to tell me everything.

318
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,640
All right.

319
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,400
I know this was my fault.

320
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:01,800
I'm sorry.

321
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,640
What I said was wrong.

322
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:07,600
If you heard that I was alone with a girl,

323
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,160
but I didn't tell you.

324
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,080
What would you think?

325
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,480
That she's a classmate.

326
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:16,960
Wouldn't you get angry
if I were to be out with a female friend?

327
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,280
The girl today was my junior
from the Ballroom Dance Club.

328
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:24,000
That's okay.

329
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:27,160
That doesn't mean
there's anything between you two.

330
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,120
She confessed to me.

331
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,880
She told me that at her birthday party.

332
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,240
Did you reject her?

333
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:43,960
I did.

334
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,280
But she said that she'll wait.

335
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:54,080
We'll be meeting each other frequently
for the next few months.

336
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,120
Do you think that's okay?

337
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,560
I trust you.

338
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:12,080
Aren't we supposed to trust each other?

339
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,160
I trust you.

340
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:17,720
That is not trust.

341
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,360
You just don't care.

342
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,080
You didn't tell me who you were with.

343
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,240
You don't care who I am with.

344
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,200
You don't care about me at all.

345
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:31,520
Shouldn't I trust you?

346
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,360
Should I be suspicious of everything?

347
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,680
All right.

348
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,280
Don't be so childish.

349
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:47,920
Let's continue talking at home.

350
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:50,880
"Childish"?

351
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:56,200
Do you think that I'm too young,
childish, and unreasonable?

352
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:02,640
Aren't you being unreasonably childish
right now?

353
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,520
Fine.

354
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,400
Forget it then.

355
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:28,360
<i>"Forget it then."</i>

356
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,120
<i>What did he mean by that?</i>

357
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:31,920
<i>"Forget it"?</i>

358
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:33,920
<i>"Let's break up"?</i>

359
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:35,920
<i>Is this what he meant?</i>

360
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:39,600
<i>What else could he mean?</i>

361
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,840
<i>Did we break up just like that?</i>

362
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:44,920
<i>First love.</i>

363
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:48,400
<i>What a fragile luxury.</i>

364
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,000
Forget it.

365
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:01,360
No one knew anyway.

366
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:04,680
At least we won't be awkward anymore
when we meet.

367
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,480
It's not too bad.

368
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,040
At least we were in love.

369
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,560
At least we experienced it.

370
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,120
Don't mind it!

371
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,120
Let's go home!

372
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,600
If I had not come back,

373
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,680
I would have really thought
that you didn't care.

374
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:35,120
Aren't you usually good with words?

375
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,120
Why are you so silly
when it comes to love?

376
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,760
Don't you know how to coax your boyfriend?

377
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,000
You...

378
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:44,240
Didn't you break up with me?

379
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,760
When did I do that?

380
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:50,000
You said, "Forget it."

381
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,760
I meant that I didn't want
to continue arguing.

382
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,320
We were both angry.

383
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,000
If we continued,
we would have hurt each other more.

384
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:04,520
Come on, stop crying.

385
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:05,480
It was my fault.

386
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:06,520
Okay?

387
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,240
I was childish, okay?

388
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:13,400
I didn't mean it.

389
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:14,480
What?

390
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:16,720
The blind date

391
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:19,400
was arranged before

392
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:20,960
we got together.

393
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:25,320
I didn't want to trouble Cong Xiao
to cancel it.

394
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:28,920
That's why I went there
to explain in person.

395
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,840
I didn't know

396
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,160
that he went there to reject me as well,

397
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,120
so...

398
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,120
I kept quiet.

399
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,040
He...

400
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,920
likes someone else too.

401
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,800
So,

402
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,240
you thought there was no need to tell me.

403
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:51,760
Yes.

404
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,280
Are you here

405
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,360
just to tell me this?

406
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,000
Yes.

407
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:58,920
Okay.

408
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:01,680
-Then look at me.
-No!

409
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,960
How can I apologize if you don't do so?

410
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,240
Come on.

411
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,160
Why are you apologizing?

412
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,400
It was my fault anyway.

413
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,680
You are still so stubborn
in taking the blame,

414
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,880
but why won't you look at me?

415
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:16,800
Come on.

416
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:18,680
I don't want to.

417
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,120
Stop pulling my hand!

418
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,280
-Stop!
-Look at me.

419
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:24,640
Stop it, or I will deduct your salary!

420
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,000
Here.

421
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:42,000
Now I know

422
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,560
why you kept it from me.

423
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:46,720
A mature man

424
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,760
would be more tactful.

425
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,400
But doubting and sulking like I did

426
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,480
will only make things worse.

427
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,800
You're right, I am childish.

428
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,560
Being tactful might not be good.

429
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:07,120
I believe being straightforward is better.

430
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:11,080
I like you because you are

431
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,120
sincere and cute.

432
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:17,200
But it would be great
if you could be gentler.

433
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,720
Fighting is bad for relationships.

434
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,320
Then...

435
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,200
Are you no longer angry?

436
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:29,000
I was wrong in the first place.

437
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,520
At least you know that.

438
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:36,040
I was wrong too
for getting jealous so easily.

439
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,120
I think that's fine.

440
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,920
At least it means

441
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,120
that you might like me more.

442
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:48,920
It's not "might".

443
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,280
I really, really, really like you.

444
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,160
Does that make you happy?

445
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,200
Smile a little for me.

446
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,040
All right.

447
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,600
I need to get home.

448
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,280
It's still early.

449
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:13,840
I'm leaving.

450
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,240
Are you really going home?

451
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,960
Go to sleep already.

452
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,280
It's almost one o'clock.

453
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,000
<i>I'll hang up when you fall sleep.</i>

454
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,960
I can't sleep with the phone on.

455
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:51,360
<i>But I want to hang up after you're asleep.</i>

456
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,560
Fanxing, don't always stay up late.

457
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,160
Go to sleep!

458
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,560
My mom is telling me to go to sleep.

459
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:11,040
<i>Then go to sleep, and I'll hang up.</i>

460
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,120
Fanxing.

461
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,120
You haven't had breakfast.
Aren't you hungry?

462
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,560
Should I make our lunch sooner?

463
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,480
She went out to receive a package

464
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:38,480
and she said she'll be having hot pot
for lunch at Xiaoyu's

465
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:40,240
to celebrate her resignation.

466
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,560
Canyang went there as well.

467
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,600
What's wrong with youngsters nowadays?

468
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:48,120
Celebrating a resignation?

469
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:50,560
Isn't it difficult to find a job?

470
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:54,440
Young people like to find excuses
to get together,

471
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,520
be it for good or bad reasons.

472
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,720
They like that everything will be okay

473
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:01,240
after they drink and tease each other.

474
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,120
If only things were so simple.

475
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,120
What happens when they sober up?

476
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:08,600
The problems will still be there.

477
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:13,880
You women just love overthinking things.

478
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:14,920
That's right.

479
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,200
We are not like you men who never think.

480
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,160
What is your brain for?

481
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,440
I know.

482
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:26,040
Your brain is there
so that when you weigh yourself,

483
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,560
you will be 100 grams heavier!

484
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,480
Hey.

485
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,160
Our brains

486
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:36,400
occupy 2 percent of our weight,
not 100 grams.

487
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:39,200
Fine, Mr. Know-it-all.

488
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:43,000
-Hongmei.
-What is it?

489
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,640
I have something to discuss.

490
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:55,240
We'll be having lunch alone.

491
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,360
Do you want some fried chicken?

492
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,760
Fried chicken?

493
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,320
Wait, no.

494
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,680
The kids are not letting us
eat greasy food.

495
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:06,960
You have high cholesterol.

496
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:10,640
Haven't you been craving it too?

497
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,160
And...

498
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:15,840
It is okay to eat junk food
once in a while.

499
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,440
Won't they know?

500
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:21,240
I promise to clean up after we finish

501
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:23,320
and erase every trace of it.

502
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,280
Okay.

503
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,760
I'll go see Canyang first.

504
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
-You put away the groceries.
-Okay.

505
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:31,360
We're not eating them today, so hurry.

506
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,120
This is great.

507
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:45,800
My friends are taking care of my child,
while Doggy prepares the food.

508
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,960
The only thing I have to do is eat.

509
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,040
This is paradise.

510
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,360
-This one.
-Do you know this?

511
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:54,720
Shen Fanfan is a complete couch potato.

512
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:58,360
When I ask him to mop the floor,
his mom will just protest,

513
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,760
saying that

514
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,640
his work is tough.

515
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,480
That he needs to rest.

516
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,720
Then how about me, the pregnant woman?

517
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:08,040
I have to mop the floor
after I come back from work.

518
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:09,840
That's expected of her.

519
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:12,160
That is her son and you are not.

520
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,320
Your mom would favor you too.

521
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:16,440
Hey.

522
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:18,240
Is Shen Fanfan coming back?

523
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,240
No.

524
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:22,120
He's practicing
for some dance competition.

525
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:23,640
Let him be.

526
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:26,000
Let him have all the fun now.

527
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:29,720
He's going to bid his fun life goodbye
very soon!

528
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,040
Time to eat!

529
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,280
Professor Song,
go wash your hands with Peanut.

530
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,920
-Come on, lunch is served!
-Stop playing for now.

531
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,000
-Okay.
-Let's go wash our hands!

532
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:45,960
We're here today to celebrate Xiaoyu
becoming an official housewife.

533
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:50,600
It's just perfect with the four of us
or we can't gossip about Shen Fanfan.

534
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:54,200
Why do women love gossiping so much?

535
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:57,640
We build our friendship
over common interests,

536
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:01,480
similar views on life,
and shared hatred of the same enemy.

537
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,880
The same enemy is the key.

538
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:07,080
Did you guys have one since high school?

539
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:21,200
Wasn't my hatred for you back then
obvious enough?

540
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,240
Yours was.

541
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,400
I hated you because I had a crush on you,

542
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,600
but you were courting that bow-legged girl

543
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:30,640
who couldn't walk straight.

544
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,160
He Fanxing hated you

545
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:35,440
because you were always watching her
that she couldn't date anyone.

546
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,800
Yang Xiaoyu hated you because...

547
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:41,080
Why did you hate him?

548
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,160
No reason.

549
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,280
I just didn't like him.

550
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,560
It doesn't make sense,

551
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:48,040
but it's He Canyang,
so it's understandable.

552
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:52,720
Don't invite me next time,

553
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,200
I want to leave the group.

554
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,080
Okay, fine.

555
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,520
We will stop bullying our Doggy.

556
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,400
Xiaoyu is expecting again.

557
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:03,600
If he leaves, you'll have no one
to beat up during labor.

558
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:05,800
You're right.

559
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,840
Your request to leave is rejected.

560
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,040
Feel free to be unhappy about it.

561
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:21,760
I have to answer this.

562
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:39,920
Go listen in on your Little Godmother.

563
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,080
Remember, stay low.

564
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:43,320
Okay.

565
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:51,720
What are you doing?

566
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:57,200
My mom entrusted me with a mission
to find out from the two of you

567
00:32:57,280 --> 00:33:00,040
if she has recent relationship issues,

568
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:02,160
since you girls talk about everything.

569
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:05,880
But you have read all our conversations
in the group chat.

570
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:08,280
I know that the three of you
have another group chat!

571
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,880
Why don't you ask her yourself?

572
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,240
Is she acting strange?

573
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:21,160
Lately, she dresses like a demon
when she goes out

574
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,680
and our neighbor saw

575
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,600
a man sent her home
in a fancy car one night.

576
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:29,160
No colleagues fit the description
and she's keeping quiet about it.

577
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,160
My mom thinks that

578
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,680
He Fanxing has been convinced
to be somebody's mistress.

579
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:35,800
Impossible!

580
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,480
Not entirely impossible.

581
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,600
Are you serious?

582
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:44,280
Don't you believe in Fanxing?

583
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:49,680
I know all sorts of people
from my experience as an arbitrator.

584
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:52,280
Fanxing is pretty and independent.

585
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:54,680
She's mature,
but has no experience in love.

586
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:56,800
Also, she is extremely naive.

587
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:59,160
She's just the perfect woman for some men.

588
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,280
Let's say we're at a gym,

589
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:05,280
a man shows off his sweaty muscular body.

590
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:08,199
He may look sexy, but not classy.

591
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:12,080
But if an ordinary guy who is just decent,

592
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:14,520
is smartly dressed

593
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,080
in a button-up shirt and tie,

594
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:19,920
he becomes way sexier
because of his properness.

595
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:24,480
What does sexiness have to do with this?

596
00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:25,520
Hey.

597
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:29,120
What she is saying is that
for some rich and powerful men

598
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:31,400
with worldly experience in life,

599
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:35,480
the innocence of sophisticated women
like He Fanxing

600
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:39,400
is better and more attractive
than that of young girls.

601
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:41,960
But...

602
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:46,360
How is this related to He Fanxing
becoming a mistress?

603
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:51,199
Rich and powerful men
who have worldly experience

604
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,960
are mostly about 30 to 40 years old,

605
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:55,159
and fit, but usually married.

606
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:58,480
They're at an age where they have
the urge to leave their wives

607
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,680
or to find a woman on their side.

608
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:05,120
In my opinion, regardless of their age,

609
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,480
men still love 25-year-old women.

610
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:11,160
That's 80 percent of men, the normal ones.

611
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:14,280
The other 20 percent
have different and varied tastes.

612
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:17,040
They like married women,

613
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:19,160
fat women, disabled women,

614
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,760
ugly women, or old women.

615
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,280
Humans are complicated.

616
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:34,000
Fanxing has always been
very demanding in love,

617
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:35,480
but she has never found someone!

618
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:39,360
A thirsty person in a desert
would even consider drinking poison.

619
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:42,120
What kind of love
that is the most attractive?

620
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,040
The kind of love that's forbidden,

621
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:47,280
stolen, and has no future.

622
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:49,920
The type that fuels the soul.

623
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,760
Do you know something?

624
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,760
That's just an analysis.

625
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:08,160
Okay.

626
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,720
I'll see you at Huada Mall.

627
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:11,040
At around three o'clock.

628
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,400
Okay, bye.

629
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:21,200
Why are you here?

630
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,760
-Are you full?
-No.

631
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,200
No?

632
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,200
Let's go eat some more then.

633
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:27,320
Come on.

634
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:35,680
Come sit down.

635
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:52,280
Why are you guys looking at me?

636
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:58,520
Well, we are here to celebrate

637
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:00,480
my new chapter as a housewife.

638
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:01,720
Let's have a toast,

639
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,400
with water as my wine.

640
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:04,600
Cheers!

641
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,160
Cheers.

642
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,040
Here.

643
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:10,440
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

644
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:31,760
You're here.

645
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:33,600
Why did you run?

646
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:34,680
You're panting.

647
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,120
I can't let you wait.

648
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,760
There's nothing wrong with it.

649
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:42,640
Arriving a little late shows
that a lady has restraint and is decent.

650
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:45,160
That's between lovers.

651
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:47,560
Punctuality does matter between friends.

652
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,480
It shows I have your back.

653
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:51,960
What a great friend!

654
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,160
Let's look out for each other.

655
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:57,200
I'll be your love guru
and you can get me, my dream girl.

656
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:59,280
-Deal!
-Okay.

657
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:03,000
Where's your niece?
Weren't you eating together?

658
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,400
I chased her away.

659
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:08,120
If she knew I was buying gifts,
she'll be asking for one too.

660
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,240
I see. Buying gifts does take time.

661
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:12,560
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

662
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,400
So you don't know what she likes at all?

663
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:25,760
Or else I wouldn't need you to be here.

664
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:28,800
In my opinion,

665
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,840
giving or receiving gifts is
something awkward.

666
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:35,080
If you received something you don't like,

667
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,760
you can't just show it.

668
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:40,480
You have to pretend to like it
and be grateful.

669
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,960
Also, you can't throw it away,

670
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:44,480
yet it takes up space.

671
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:48,280
You're right.

672
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:53,520
Well, since it's a gift
for the person you like,

673
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:55,680
it can't be too expensive,

674
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:58,120
but not too plain either.

675
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,040
She has to like it too.

676
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:06,520
How does she usually dress?

677
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,280
Not that different from you.

678
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:15,560
Right.

679
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,280
To men,

680
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:20,280
a big difference is no difference.

681
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:24,440
This is why your wisdom is important.

682
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:27,480
Help me pick a gift
that leaves a good impression.

683
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,040
Money isn't an issue.

684
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:32,600
I'm willing to spend
for my future girlfriend.

685
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:37,800
What an upstart.

686
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:40,480
Do I no longer need to replace
that dress I owe?

687
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:43,440
-Or did you forget about it?
-No, you must replace it.

688
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:44,840
I know.

689
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:47,440
The dress I ordered is on its way.

690
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:55,000
If I am not mistaken,
there's a jeweler selling trinkets there.

691
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:56,760
-Let's go there.
-Okay.

692
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:20,120
Did Peanut make a mistake?

693
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:22,160
Is it not Huada Mall,

694
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:23,760
but Lida Mall?

695
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:25,880
Or Huahao Mall?

696
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:50,520
Stupid Old Man Ye.

697
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:52,040
Where is he hiding her?

698
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:53,680
Why won't he let me see her?

699
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:16,680
Cai Minmin?

700
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:19,000
What a coincidence.

701
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:24,600
Professor He?

702
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:25,760
What a coincidence.

703
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:27,000
Are you here shopping alone?

704
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:29,200
No, I'm here with my uncle.

705
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:31,360
I should meet up with him. Goodbye!

706
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,080
You're too old to cling onto him.

707
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:35,040
Let's go. I'll buy you dessert.

708
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:37,280
Sir, I don't like desserts!

709
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:45,680
Eat up.

710
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:47,120
I hardly ever treat students.

711
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:52,520
Professor He, how about this?

712
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:53,920
You bought me dessert,

713
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,920
so I'll give you the Three Squirrels nuts.

714
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:57,880
No, you better finish this yourself.

715
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,440
Professor He, I swear.

716
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:04,000
I won't say a word about you
and Professor Song.

717
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:05,480
My lips are sealed.

718
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:11,040
