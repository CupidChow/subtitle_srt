1
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,960
<i>Would anyone else work so hard</i>

2
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,240
<i>to give financial support</i>

3
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,520
<i>to their boyfriend like me?</i>

00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,120
TOTAL 4,200 YUAN
YUAN SONG

5
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,520
Hey.

6
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,440
Dating needs a lot of money, right?

7
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,600
Not really. Why are you asking?

8
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,440
I was just wondering.

9
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,840
If women are a hassle

10
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,240
and if you have to spend a lot on gifts
because they want everything?

11
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,400
Dating itself is a hassle,

12
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,920
so you have to enjoy it when you can.

13
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,520
Gifts are inevitable.

14
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,280
As for how much one would spend,

15
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,720
just keep it within your means.

16
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,880
Aren't you living in a studio apartment
next to West Lake Park?

17
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,120
Isn't the rent there expensive?

18
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,800
About 4,000 to 5,000 yuan?

19
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:06,520
Your salary can't even cover
your living expenses.

20
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,800
Your family is helping you, right?

21
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,760
They do chip in,

22
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,160
but I work part-time too.

23
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,240
A part-time job?

24
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,600
You must earn a lot.

25
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,120
I guess so.

26
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,680
It pays better than our job.

27
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,440
Why are you asking?

28
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,400
All your shoes are pricey.

29
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,080
Are they?

30
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,680
My family bought them for me.

31
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,560
I see.

32
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,840
Did you

33
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,760
find the card?

34
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,920
Damn it! I died!

35
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,360
My wife is angry now.

36
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,440
What were you saying? What card?

37
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:49,880
It's nothing.

38
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,440
What wife are you talking about?

39
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:53,920
You've got a girlfriend?

40
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,800
My in-game wife.

41
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,600
I'm helping her level up
and buying her some skins.

42
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,320
This is expensive too.

43
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,760
An online relationship?

44
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
No.

45
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,400
We're just an in-game couple.
We play games together.

46
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:09,720
If it's an online relationship,
how would just buying skins suffice?

47
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,520
Trust me.

48
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,120
You really should find a real girlfriend.

49
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,880
It's way different from some in-game wife.

50
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:18,880
As if I don't know.

51
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:20,600
Your parents gave you

52
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:23,120
all the advantages
needed to attract a woman.

53
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:24,920
As for me,

54
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,880
my looks are average. My pay is average,

55
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,280
and I commute by train.

56
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:31,560
I'm just a geek.
We all know I won't achieve much.

57
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,480
Women are all pampered by their parents.

58
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,960
It'd be such a shame for them to date me.

59
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,920
I should just live a quiet life alone.

60
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:42,520
Living a quiet life alone is better than
dragging someone else with you into it.

61
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,000
A man like you sure is rare.

62
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:49,600
Do you think I need to be praised
by an adolescent like you?

63
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,480
I'm sorry!

64
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,760
-I'm late.
-It's okay!

65
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,240
-I made you all wait.
-It's fine.

66
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,040
Everyone has busy days.

67
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,760
Mr. Zhao, let's have a quick discussion

68
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,720
and then you can rest for the weekend.

69
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,880
That's great.
You see, I thought it would look majestic

70
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:11,440
after painting it blue,
but it's not what I expected.

71
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,000
This isn't what I want.

72
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:16,160
<i>I'm not a mind reader.</i>

73
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:19,720
<i>How would I know what you wanted?</i>

74
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,560
About that, Mr. Zhao.

75
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,440
You see, in our contract,

76
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:28,160
it's written that we only provide
a one-time free repaint.

77
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,600
Of course, since you'll be living here,

78
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,880
you should have a color you like.

79
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,120
But there will be additional fees.

80
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,000
-Besides the paint, our employees--
-Don't worry!

81
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,480
I won't change the color.

82
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,640
I just want this wall

83
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,600
to be knocked down!

84
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,680
Goodness.

85
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:56,840
Do you want to go--

86
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:57,880
Hello?

87
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,760
I just got off work.

88
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:01,840
Where are you?

89
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,200
Sure.

90
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,800
Okay. I have something to do.
I'll leave first.

91
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,120
Bye.

92
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,280
That's life.

93
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,480
When you dread being alone,
you end up alone.

94
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,520
Where's my measuring tape?

95
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,720
Yuan Song! Is my measuring tape with you?

96
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,640
Wait!

97
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,400
My measuring...

98
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,880
Welcome!

99
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,560
Welcome!

100
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,200
How's the renovation going?

101
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,800
The design is done.

102
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,320
They'll start in the middle of the month.

103
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,200
When that happens,
I can meet with my dream guy every day.

104
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,360
Calm down.

105
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,520
I've thought about it.

106
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,560
I also agree that
the two of you aren't that compatible.

107
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,280
What do you mean "also"?

108
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,640
Didn't the assistant professor

109
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,000
talk about your financial differences?

110
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,120
Look, this meal costs
more than a thousand yuan.

111
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,960
Your shopping is more than 10,000 yuan.

112
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,840
If you really like him,
don't be a burden to him.

113
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,480
Don't crush his values perspectives.

114
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:43,280
Furthermore,
he currently has a girlfriend.

115
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,320
Remember what I taught you?

116
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,120
No matter how good it is,
if it's not yours,

117
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,680
don't touch it.

118
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,360
You're so contradictory!

119
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,800
I'm not trying to ruin their relationship.

120
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,560
You're the one who told me
to keep an eye out and wait for my chance.

121
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:01,480
So I'm waiting! Can't I wait?

122
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:05,600
Sometimes, emotions and rational thinking
contradict each other.

123
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:08,360
Emotionally, I support you
and that you should try hard.

124
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,080
But rationally speaking,

125
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,680
you should stop.

126
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,120
You're at the peak of your life.

127
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,120
Waiting will only waste your youth.

128
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:20,240
I'm prepared to waste my entire life,
my youth is nothing.

129
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:23,120
Welcome!

130
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,880
Uncle, be honest with me.

131
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:34,039
Are you worried I'd spend your money
and my parents' money on men?

132
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,400
-Wouldn't you?
-I would.

133
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,280
That's why I never worry about that.

134
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,679
I'm simply suggesting
it's time to change your target.

135
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,160
That's all?

136
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,640
That's all.

137
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,760
My uncle would never lie to me.

138
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,520
I shall think about it.

139
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,360
Eat up.

140
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,040
You're still growing.

141
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,960
Look at you, you don't eat well at school.

142
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:08,120
Uncle, you should eat more instead.

143
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,800
Look at you, you've lost weight.

144
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,840
Don't work so hard to make money.

145
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,280
I can't spend it all.

146
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,640
By the way, how are things with Aunt?

147
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,840
She's still lost.

148
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,400
I'm waiting for her to come to her senses.

149
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,600
We're both waiting.

150
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,240
One of us is more than enough.

151
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,480
If all of us wait,

152
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:32,120
the Ye family will only have backups.

153
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,120
You're old.

154
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,480
You're already past your prime.

155
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,520
If you can't make this work,
don't waste your life on it.

156
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,720
You should change your target.

157
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,720
-You change.
-I'll change if you do.

158
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,240
Would I ask this of you if I could?

159
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,240
Why must one of us change?

160
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,320
For the family honor.

161
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,000
Looks like the Ye family
will only have backups.

162
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,560
Hello, Song Xue?

163
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,760
<i>I'm at your house.</i>

164
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,480
<i>Are you coming back for dinner?</i>

165
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,840
Why are you there?

166
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,600
<i>It's a long story.</i>

167
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,320
<i>I'm dying.</i>

168
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,120
<i>When are you coming back?</i>

169
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,520
SONG XUE
6:32 P.M.

170
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,640
I'll head back right now.

171
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,280
Bye.

172
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,080
I'm sorry.
The meeting is still not finished.

173
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,400
-Are you hungry?
<i>-No.</i>

174
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,720
My friend is at my place,
so I have to go now.

175
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:44,520
Okay.

176
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,320
Then, are you free tomorrow?

177
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,400
Tomorrow isn't good.

178
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,200
I'm attending a wedding.

179
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,600
Li Haomiao's?

180
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,000
You remember?

181
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:55,720
Very clearly.

182
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,400
Keep in touch then.

183
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,280
Let's talk later.

184
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,760
-Bye.
-<i>Bye.</i>

185
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,320
Here.

186
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:14,000
Do the prawns
that Grandpa He cooked taste good?

187
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,880
It's good. The tofu that Grandma He made

188
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,160
is good too.

189
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,560
-Look at you.
-What a sweet talker.

190
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,880
She knows how not to offend anyone.

191
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,240
I'm home.

192
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,600
You're back.

193
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,440
Little Godmother, you're back?

194
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,480
Peanut is here?

195
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,400
Where's her mom?

196
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,560
Don't bring it up.

197
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:42,800
Xiaoyu's mother-in-law fell down.
She's at the hospital.

198
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,040
Her husband is on a business trip,

199
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,880
so she called me and sent Peanut over.

200
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,280
I thought Peanut was so well-behaved,

201
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,520
I could probably take care of her
for at least two days.

202
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:53,920
But who knew

203
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,800
taking care of a kid
isn't as easy as I thought.

204
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,880
It's only been half a day and I'm drained.

205
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,800
Yang Xiaoyu is a superwoman.

206
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:04,880
She has one in her belly
and one in her hand.

207
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,320
Of course.

208
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,200
Taking care of kids is tiring.

209
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,960
They can't even walk properly.

210
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:12,600
When Fanxing and Canyang were little,

211
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:15,960
my parents weren't around
so they couldn't help.

212
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:19,840
My husband used to cook all
the meals for the day in the morning.

213
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,640
If they were acting up that day,

214
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,720
I wouldn't even have time to eat.

215
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:27,560
At night, we'd each take care
of one child.

216
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,520
It was a good thing that we were young.

217
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,160
Otherwise, we couldn't have endured it.

218
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,680
That's right.

219
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,120
Caring for kids is very tiring.

220
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,560
But it's very fulfilling.

221
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,040
You watch them

222
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,400
grow,

223
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:43,840
learn,

224
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,400
get prettier.

225
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,200
It's so satisfying. Right?

226
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,360
Yes.

227
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,400
Song Xue,

228
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:55,440
you've been with Dongyang
for almost eight years.

229
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,440
You two must be really stable now, right?

230
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,080
Why aren't you two getting married?

231
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,160
We don't plan to have kids,

232
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,960
so marriage isn't necessary.

233
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:08,880
Just like now, if everything is good,
we'll just be together.

234
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:11,960
If it gets bad,
a certificate won't do any good.

235
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,640
We even have to split assets.

236
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:14,920
How troublesome.

237
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,080
I really don't understand
young people nowadays.

238
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:22,720
When you're single,
you don't find a partner.

239
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,000
After finding one,
you don't want to get married.

240
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:29,040
And after you get married,
you don't want kids.

241
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,440
You won't be able to have kids
when you reach our age.

242
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,560
What are you going to do then?

243
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:39,360
Mrs. He, back in your time,

244
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,680
it was normal
to marry early and have kids.

245
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:45,520
Now, late marriage
and birth control is a norm.

246
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,680
In life, there is more than one path.

247
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,880
There are countless possibilities.

248
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,680
You're young.

249
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,360
You don't know what it's like to be old.

250
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,560
You'll regret it later.

251
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,480
I'll regret it, then.

252
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,800
Anyway, no matter how careful
you live your life,

253
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,480
you'll still have regrets.

254
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,480
Furthermore, what if I regret
not being persistent

255
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:09,720
when I'm old?

256
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:15,000
Grandma He, I want the prawns.

257
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:19,120
-Okay. Here it is.
-Here's a prawn.

258
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,840
Song Xue really is a professor.

259
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,720
She came and gave me a lesson.

260
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,880
When I think back,

261
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,880
she does make a lot of sense.

262
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:30,640
See?

263
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,120
What we say won't work.

264
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,760
Madam Shen Hongmei
only listens to Professor Song.

265
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:38,800
Song Xue, come often for dinner.

266
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:39,960
Sure.

267
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,680
And Peanut too.

268
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:46,160
Bring your mom next time, okay?

269
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,600
No. My mom can't come.

270
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,720
Why?

271
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,760
Don't you want to share Grandpa He's
and Grandma He's cooking?

272
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:56,320
-Right?
-My mom is too tired.

273
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,640
She wants to rest at home.

274
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,680
My mom cried

275
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,680
and said she was very tired.

276
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,080
Peanut, who did your mom say that to?

277
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,840
Mom told that to Dad.

278
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,880
Dad cried too.

279
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,800
He said he's tired too.

280
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,520
Is being an adult so tiring?

281
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:27,720
I'll get that.

282
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,680
Coming!

283
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,480
Mrs. Wang.

284
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:37,920
I'm here to talk to your mom.

285
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,080
Have you eaten yet?

286
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,360
We're eating now.

287
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,560
Mrs. Wang!

288
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,800
Whose cutie is this?

289
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,440
This cutie

290
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,320
is Fanxing's goddaughter.

291
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,440
Peanut, greet Grandma Wang.

292
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,320
Hi, Grandma Wang.

293
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,720
Good girl.

294
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,280
You have guests.

295
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,120
Not really.

296
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,520
She's like our child.

297
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:05,480
She's Fanxing's best friend, Song Xue.

298
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:08,120
Song Xue, this is Mrs. Wang
from downstairs.

299
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,840
She basically watched them grow up.

300
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:12,800
Hi, Mrs. Wang.

301
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,120
Hello.

302
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,800
Eat up.

303
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,520
Eat up.

304
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,440
"Song Xue"?

305
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:27,000
Could you be Professor Song
from <i>The Love Clinic</i>?

306
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,400
Yes, that's me.

307
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,760
Do you know who I am?

308
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,840
How can I not know?

309
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:35,320
You're my favorite on <i>The Love Clinic</i>!

310
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:38,120
You look better in person than on TV!

311
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,960
Fanxing, how could you not tell me?

312
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,680
You have a celebrity friend,

313
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,120
but you're hiding her.

314
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,120
What celebrity friend?

315
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,000
Mrs. Wang, you're making me blush!

316
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,920
It's just a mediation program.

317
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,480
-How can you say that?
-Mrs. Wang.

318
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:56,200
Didn't you say
you like that fat expert the most?

319
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,600
You said that the fat expert
is the only one who is right.

320
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,280
Who would say that?

321
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,880
How can he compare to Professor Song?

322
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,000
He talks like he's picking a fight.

323
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,640
Look at Professor Song.

324
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,680
Right, Professor Song!

325
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,240
Since I met you today,

326
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:15,640
I happen to have a question for you.

327
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,680
Do you think it would be okay--

328
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,480
Sure. I'm done anyway.

329
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,960
Say, Mrs. Wang. Let's go somewhere else.

330
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,040
How about the living room?

331
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,480
Sure!

332
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,000
Over here.

333
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,400
Fanxing, make some tea for Professor Song.

334
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:30,800
Use the best one.

335
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,360
Come, Professor Song. Have a seat.

336
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:34,800
Here.

337
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,240
Have a seat.

338
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,760
Fanxing, go make tea.

339
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:42,840
Hurry up.

340
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:43,880
Have a seat.

341
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:49,040
Professor Song, here's the thing.

342
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,560
I have a pair of twin granddaughters.

343
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,320
-Congratulations, Mrs. Wang!
-Thank you.

344
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:58,000
My son and my daughter-in-law
met on a blind date.

345
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:03,800
Peanut is asleep?

346
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:05,760
My mom took her.

347
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,680
You're done? My turn.

348
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,840
I'm so tired today.

349
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:13,360
Mrs. Wang really talks a lot.

350
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:16,400
Should I invite her
to our mediation program?

351
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:19,480
If she goes,
she'll take over the whole show.

352
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,480
I'm going to take a shower.

353
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,800
YUAN SONG

354
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,760
<i>Okay, I'm almost home.</i>

355
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:45,120
<i>Have fun at the wedding. Miss you.</i>

356
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,000
I forgot my towel.

357
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:52,200
It's so wet.

358
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,400
What's wrong? Are you a zombie?

359
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,760
Braised Meat!

360
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,240
Come here.

361
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:32,440
<i>I made dumplings.</i>

362
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,960
<i>Just reheat them in the microwave.</i>

363
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,920
<i>You've worked hard, intern.</i>

364
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,560
Why are you here, Little He Fanxing?

365
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,320
There, there.

366
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,280
Braised Meat, you're in luck.

367
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:43,720
Are you happy? She got you this.

368
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:57,520
<i>Hardworking lady,
you've filled up my fridge and house.</i>

369
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:00,880
<i>I can't repay you.
Please let me give myself to you again.</i>

370
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,240
"Again"?

371
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,840
That felt so good!

372
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,080
Are you asleep?

373
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,800
You fell asleep that quick?

374
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,000
<i>Sorry for the wait.</i>

375
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,400
<i>I've checked.</i>

376
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,400
<i>This necklace is on a cooling-off period.</i>

377
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:14,320
<i>If it's in good condition,
it can be returned with the receipt.</i>

378
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,520
Okay. I'll drop by later then.

379
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,960
<i>Ms. He, this necklace
is a limited edition item.</i>

380
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:21,680
<i>You were lucky to be able to get it.</i>

381
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,320
<i>Do you want to reconsider returning it?</i>

382
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:26,760
No. Thank you. I'll see you later.

383
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:27,960
All right.

384
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:50,000
Bride and groom, you may exchange rings.

385
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:04,440
Three, two, one!

386
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,640
Congratulations to the lady!

387
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:11,400
She will be the next bride!

388
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:29,040
And here I thought
you and Li Haomiao would get married.

389
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:32,600
Don't say that, he just got married.

390
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,440
Didn't he confess to you in public?

391
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:39,600
A ten-year promise. How romantic it was!

392
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:43,360
Girls like us who aren't pretty

393
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,880
are always those classmates
with no happy endings.

394
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:49,080
Come on. Stop teasing me.

395
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:51,600
Would anyone believe that kind of talk?

396
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,760
But I know you.

397
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:56,720
He wasn't serious, but you were.

398
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,840
You were always single.

399
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,880
I thought you were really waiting for him.

400
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,480
It was just that back then,

401
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,200
I've never met anyone I really liked.

402
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,080
I have a boyfriend now.

403
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:11,480
Really? That's great!

404
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,400
Hold on to him tight.

405
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,520
My daughter is already finishing
elementary school.

406
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,960
You're the last single in our class.

407
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,000
Li Haomiao is now married.

408
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,640
The next one

409
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,480
will be Amy.

410
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,680
The one you hate the most.

411
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:30,560
It's her who hates me.

412
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,120
I don't hate her.

413
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,520
It's not that much of a difference.

414
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:37,240
When I saw her earlier,
I almost couldn't recognize her.

415
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:40,240
Her double eyelids
were cut wider than a highway.

416
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:44,560
I almost thought that
she was a shape-shifter!

417
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,560
You're right.

418
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:52,440
She overdid it with cosmetic surgery.

419
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,320
Two years ago, she started
a micro business by selling facial masks.

420
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,960
But masks are hard to sell now.

421
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,400
So now she's working as some
purchasing agent for French goods.

422
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:02,160
She met her current boyfriend on a plane.

423
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:05,800
I think he works at a Fortune 500 company.

424
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,360
Hey. Look at that.

425
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,520
She's showing off a huge diamond.

426
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,880
But her hand is like pickled chicken feet.

427
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,240
She's basically shoving it in your face.

428
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,360
Pickled chicken feet?

429
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,400
Don't let her hear you.

430
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,360
He Fanxing.

431
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:31,080
It's been forever,
you haven't changed one bit.

432
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,000
You've changed a lot.

433
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,400
I almost couldn't recognize you.

434
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,880
You're getting prettier.

435
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:41,280
People say that when a woman is over 30,

436
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:44,160
you can tell if she's doing well
by looking at her face.

437
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:45,960
That couldn't be truer.

438
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:50,360
You hated me
when we were in college, right?

439
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:53,000
Everyone said I was prettier.

440
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:56,120
I was quite proud,
so it was quite annoying.

441
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,320
But that's not your fault.

442
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:58,960
Who said that?

443
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,480
Those classmates.

444
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,440
They must be lying.

445
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,480
They hate you, but don't want to say it,

446
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:07,280
so they blame it on me.

447
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,440
We're not even that close.

448
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,040
Fine. Let's not talk about that.

449
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:13,640
So, do you have a boyfriend?

450
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,400
You can't stay single forever.

451
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:19,520
There are some good men
amongst my husband's employees.

452
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,080
Should I keep an eye out for you?

453
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:24,560
No, thank you. I have a boyfriend.

454
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,640
Really? What kind of person is he?

455
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,880
He's her colleague!

456
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:33,160
A young man, really handsome.

457
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,440
When he flirts, everyone falls for him.

458
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,040
Really?

459
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:39,720
The bride is so beautiful.

460
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,520
Li Haomiao, you're so lucky!

461
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,440
Congratulations! May you have kids soon!

462
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,280
Thank you, class rep.

463
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:50,480
And thank you, everyone,
for coming to my wedding.

464
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:52,800
Since you've given us red packets, eat up!

465
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,480
-Okay!
-All right!

466
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,200
I'll go talk to my best friend.

467
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,800
Sure, I'll go over later.

468
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:04,560
Li Haomiao,
you've met He Fanxing's boyfriend?

469
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,600
Yes.

470
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,760
Our new house was renovated
by their company.

471
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,960
He Fanxing's boyfriend is very young?

472
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:15,520
My husband bought a 7,000 sqft. house
with a view of the river.

473
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:18,400
We want to drop by He Fanxing's company
to make inquiries.

474
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:20,080
I'll watch out for him.

475
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,480
Her boyfriend is in his early twenties.

476
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,360
His name was Song. What was it again?

477
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,000
No. Not him.

478
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,680
He was just joking.

479
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:32,560
He's actually an intern at our company.

480
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,240
He was just joking.

481
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,000
How could he joke about that?

482
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,760
I always scold him for being too cheeky.

483
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,600
Who is it then?

484
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:41,920
Is he a colleague?

485
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:44,080
No, he's not.

486
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,040
He's from an advertising firm.

487
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:48,040
He's in charge of

488
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,040
product designs and things.

489
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,120
Which advertising firm?

490
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:54,520
My husband's company
needs advertising too.

491
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,560
Okay, enough.

492
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:59,400
Why would you ask so much about
a classmate's boyfriend?

493
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,920
What are you after?

494
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:03,520
You're a seductive person. Drink up.

495
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,720
-Let's drink together.
-Here.

496
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:10,080
Is it my fault for being so pretty?

497
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,240
Here.

498
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,320
Take it.

499
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,640
I returned the necklace you gave me.

500
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,120
I appreciate the thought.

501
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:41,120
But you're still
spending your parents' money.

502
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:44,000
Given your income,

503
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:46,280
this necklace is too expensive.

504
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,800
You can't afford it.

505
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,240
You've returned it?

506
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:51,720
Yes.

507
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:54,960
This necklace is worth a month's rent.

508
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:57,640
You've returned it?

509
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,920
No. Forget it.

510
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,640
-Reset!
-What do you mean?

511
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:09,840
Initially, I thought you gave me

512
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,680
one of those few hundred yuan
silver necklaces.

513
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:13,920
That's why I took it.

514
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,280
But looking back at it,

515
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,680
you've given me roses

516
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:22,000
and a necklace worth thousands of yuan.

517
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:25,560
It kind of puts pressure on me.

518
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:29,480
At this stage that we're at,

519
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:32,120
can't we maintain a type...

520
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:37,960
of pure relationship
that doesn't involve money?

521
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,280
What do we do then?

522
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:45,880
Are we going
to split the bill on every date?

523
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,560
Yes, splitting the bill is good.

524
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,880
Let's split.

525
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,240
What's the point

526
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:55,120
of being together
if we are so calculative?

527
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,640
Don't look down on me.

528
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:01,800
Stupid mouth!

529
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,920
No! Forget it, reset!

530
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,720
He Fanxing.

531
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,000
Do you have...

532
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,120
something to tell me?

533
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,360
I...

534
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:23,760
I'm worried you'll be angry.

535
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,000
Or feel bad.

536
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:29,120
It's for your own good,

537
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:32,080
but I can't say it right now.

538
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,880
Why?

539
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,600
Did you do something that will anger me?

540
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:42,560
From my perspective,

541
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:47,360
I did something rational
and beneficial for us both.

542
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,800
But I just realized,

543
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:53,080
from your perspective,

544
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:56,880
it might hurt your pride.

545
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:01,040
So what is it?

546
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,520
Never mind, don't ask.

547
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:06,520
I'm just slow and stubborn.

548
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:08,120
I'm regretting it now.

549
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,240
I'm regretting it.

550
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:11,960
Just tell me.
I'll just be anxious if you don't.

551
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,880
I won't get angry.

552
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:17,520
I...

553
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:22,120
I returned the necklace!
I want to give you back the money.

554
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:35,520
No!

555
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:48,760
Have you been waiting long?

556
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:50,880
I'll hold Baylor for you.

557
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:55,760
Thank you.

558
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,880
It's just been two days
and you're already so distant.

559
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,560
"Thank you"?

560
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:05,120
Even if it's the closest person to you,
you should say thank you.

561
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:08,320
Everything you say
can be heard by the heart.

562
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,680
Only my girlfriend
could say wise words right off the bat.

563
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,560
I'm not saying wise words.

564
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:18,280
I know. I'm just teasing you.

565
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,560
I like to bully you.

566
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,200
And watch you panic.

567
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,560
You! Who thinks like that?

568
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:37,040
Why aren't you wearing your necklace?

569
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,800
I thought you'd wear it every day.

570
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:43,640
I heard if a woman gets sick of a gift,

571
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:46,240
she'll get sick of the one
who gave it as well.

572
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:50,840
No.

573
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,400
Don't think like that.

574
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:54,640
I like the necklace a lot.

575
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,760
I like you a lot too. I'm not sick of it!

576
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:00,160
And I'm not the type
who only likes new stuff.

577
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,880
Confessing in public in broad daylight?

578
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:07,240
He Fanxing,
we're supposed to be keeping it a secret.

579
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,560
Why are you so bold?

580
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,440
Why are you so mean?

581
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:14,160
Come on, let's go!

582
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:15,440
Don't you dare run!

583
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,480
Braised Meat!

584
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:18,360
Baylor, teach him a lesson!

585
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:19,840
Don't you dare run!

586
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,200
Baylor! Kill him for me!

587
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,560
Melon, hurry up.

588
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:31,760
It's Mr. He's class,
you're his main target.

589
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:34,160
Almost done.

590
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:37,800
Mr. He is an assistant professor
in the Art Appreciation class,

591
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,440
of course, he has good taste.

592
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,640
Yes. You're the prettiest girl
in the world.

593
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:46,160
Who knows, he might suddenly
make you retake his class.

594
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,280
Watch it! Don't jinx me.

595
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:07,000
Let's go, we're late.

596
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:08,320
Let's go.

597
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:26,360
Okay, let's begin.

598
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:29,719
Today's topic is the world-famous sculpt--

599
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:30,840
Sir!

600
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:39,400
Seems like Team Rocket
is having a bad day.

601
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:40,840
Hurry up and take a seat.

602
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:50,480
Today's topic is

603
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:52,840
the appraisal of world-famous sculptures.

604
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,040
Professor He!

605
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,239
Have you taken attendance?

606
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,560
You're the star of our class.

607
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:02,040
If you're here, then everyone's here.

608
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:06,080
Okay, let's begin!

609
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:09,760
Today's topic is the appraisal
of world-famous sculptures.

610
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:22,760
Need something?

611
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:33,840
Professor He,

612
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,480
I have something to tell you.

613
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,360
Go ahead.

614
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,520
Professor He,

615
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:45,880
you really care about me,
and even bought me dessert.

616
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,200
I know

617
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:49,880
how you feel.

618
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:53,000
I know you can't help it
when you like someone,

619
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:56,280
but I think it's better
if I make it clear.

620
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:00,840
Even though I don't mind an age gap,

621
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:04,240
you're really nice and charming,

622
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,720
but you're not my type.

623
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:10,600
I'm so sorry.

624
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:12,600
That's all.

625
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,680
Did I just get rejected?

626
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:30,640
Why?

627
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,480
<i>I didn't expect this either.</i>

628
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:49,560
<i>But he's different from the other geeks.</i>

629
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,160
<i>He's good-looking.</i>

630
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:54,040
<i>When he comes to work,
his hair often looks unkempt,</i>

631
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:55,920
<i>but his clothes are clean.</i>

632
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,840
<i>And he's unlike other male colleagues</i>

633
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:00,000
who always tell dirty jokes to girls.

634
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:02,360
When we go out, he'd ask the girls
not to drink too much.

635
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:05,400
He'd send the girls home
even if he appears unwilling.

636
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:08,680
<i>But most importantly,
he gets the job done.</i>

637
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:11,720
<i>He only occasionally
spends money on games.</i>

638
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:12,880
<i>Besides a home loan,</i>

639
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:15,560
<i>he saves his money for early retirement.</i>

640
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:35,480
Office romances

641
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:38,520
are a real critical blow
to those of us who are single.

642
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,320
It takes two to tango.

643
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,800
Don't get ahead of yourself.

644
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:44,000
Why?

645
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,560
You don't want them to date each other?

646
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:47,880
What does this have to do with me?

647
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,760
Of course it does.

648
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,840
When a guy friend starts to date,

649
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:55,440
whether you distance yourself
or the partner requests for it,

650
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:58,040
you will eventually grow distant.

651
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:06,280
Ms. He, have you heard?

652
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:07,400
About what?

653
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:10,160
The owner might be selling the company.

654
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:12,960
Who said that?

655
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:17,520
That day,
I vaguely heard Mr. Li calling the owner.

656
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:21,720
The owner's migration application
to Australia seems to have been approved.

657
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,480
He might be selling the company.

658
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:27,120
Bai, in a single breath,

659
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:30,120
you've said, "vaguely",
"seems to", and "might".

660
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,160
Don't spread these kinds of news

661
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:35,080
that you pieced up yourself.

662
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:36,360
You'll affect everyone.

663
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,720
Got it.

664
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:42,320
You're just thinking too much
and worrying about nothing.

665
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,720
Mr. Li has always been
managing our company.

666
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,360
So what if we change owners?

667
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:47,920
It's fine if they just pay us on time.

668
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:50,000
Let's get back to work.

669
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:00,000
Come in.

670
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:02,200
Ms. He.

671
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,280
What is it?

672
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,040
I brought you some ginger tea.

673
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:09,320
Drink this for a few days.
You'll feel better.

674
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:12,720
You even know my menstrual cycle?

675
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:15,720
There are only a few days every month

676
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:18,560
when you only drink hot water
and not tea or coffee.

677
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,640
You're quite observant.

678
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:25,240
No wonder all your clients praise you.

679
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:29,840
It must be destiny
that you ended up as a salesperson.

680
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:32,440
Drink up.

681
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:33,520
Thank you.

682
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:36,880
Yes, right.
About helping you as a wingwoman,

683
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,560
I'll get it done soon

684
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:41,440
or I'll feel indebted to you
every time we meet.

685
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:42,880
No need to rush.

686
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,800
I'll let you arrange it.

687
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:48,160
And if I meet good candidates,
I'll introduce them to you.

688
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:52,440
No, thanks.

689
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:53,680
I'm not in the mood.

690
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,440
I get it.

691
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:58,000
Blind dates are so tiring.

692
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,440
Rest for a while then.

693
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:01,440
-I'll get to work.
-Okay.

694
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:04,560
Ms. He,

695
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,840
you really are rich.

696
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:12,320
That necklace cost thousands,
but you only wore it for a day.

697
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:13,720
If I were you,

698
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,720
I'd wear it for at least half a month.

699
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:28,360
Can you stop crying?

700
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:33,280
And tell Su Li to stop arranging
blind dates for me.

701
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:34,320
I have--

702
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:37,160
It's real!

703
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:38,880
I'm not making it up, okay?

704
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,000
Her surname is He.

705
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:41,720
She's 32 years old
and an executive director.

706
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:42,920
Her parents are alive.

707
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,040
She also has a twin brother.

708
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:48,000
Yes.

709
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:49,320
Don't worry.

710
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:51,600
I'll introduce her to you soon.

711
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:53,800
Baylor! Slow down!

712
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:55,520
Hey, I'm hanging up.

713
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:57,360
I have to work hard for my happiness.

714
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:58,320
Bye!

715
00:40:58,560 --> 00:40:59,800
Love Charm, let's go.

716
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:02,000
Slow down!

717
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:03,280
Slow down!

718
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:09,600
-Your dog can really run.
-Thank you.

719
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:13,360
I'm old, so my legs are weak
or else he wouldn't be running off.

720
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:15,720
-Are you okay?
-I'm fine.

721
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:16,920
Thank you.

722
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:19,600
Should I send you back home?

723
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:20,800
This breed runs a lot.

724
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,800
It'll be bad if he pulls you around again.

725
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:24,560
I don't...

726
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:26,320
I don't want to trouble you.

727
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:28,360
No, not at all.
I was here to walk my dog too.

728
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:29,960
We were just going around the lake.

729
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:31,840
Well...

730
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,560
Okay, then. Thank you.

731
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:35,200
-No problem.
-Thank you.

732
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,200
-Come.
-Baylor!

733
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,240
My son or daughter
would usually come with me.

734
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:42,000
-Really?
-Yes.

735
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:45,080
When big dogs run,
there's no way you can hold them down.

736
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:46,240
True.

737
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,800
They're too strong.

738
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:52,200
Judging from your accent,

739
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:53,640
you're not from around here?

740
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:55,640
Yes.

741
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:59,560
I'm here because my company
transferred me here.

742
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:01,960
Later on, I resigned and left,

743
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:03,640
but stayed to start a business.

744
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:06,040
My family is pretty small.

745
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:07,480
My parents passed away early.

746
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:10,160
My sister and brother-in-law raised me
in their stead.

747
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:14,120
You have kids, right?

748
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:15,760
Probably around my age?

749
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:17,280
A son and a daughter.

750
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:19,400
Our daughter lives with us,

751
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:20,920
and our son lives across the hallway.

752
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:24,160
They're both independent
and full of personality.

753
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:26,640
I usually talk to young people

754
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:30,360
to learn new things from them.

755
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:32,240
I don't want to be outdated.

756
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:33,960
Wasn't there a saying?

757
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:35,640
"Catch up or get beaten up!"

758
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:38,200
Such a great mentality.

759
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:42,520
If my dad was alive, he would be like you.

760
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:46,600
I live in this block.

761
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,800
If you're not in a hurry,
come have a cup of tea.

762
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:53,360
Such a coincidence!
A friend of mine lives in this block too.

763
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:55,280
Who? What's your friend's name?

764
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:57,280
The community is very closely-knit,

765
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:59,320
I probably know who it is.

766
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:02,760
She's pretty and has a good personality.

767
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:04,800
Her name is He Fanxing. Do you know her?

768
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:09,400
