1
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,600
Don't curse me.

2
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:06,120
Yesterday,
I received a handwritten love letter.

3
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,400
In this society

4
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,840
where people are communicating
through texts,

5
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:14,080
I still received
a handwritten love letter.

6
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,400
Handwritten.

7
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,520
How precious and sincere.

8
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:23,160
As long as you still feel precious
and sincere after you have broken up.

9
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,280
To keep this preciousness and sincerity,

10
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,600
I turned her down.

11
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,320
You actually turned her down.

12
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,280
Was it because she's ugly?

13
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:33,880
She isn't.

14
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,240
Then you don't like her?

15
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,160
I wouldn't say that.

16
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,400
We're just not compatible.

17
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,600
What's going on?

18
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:47,080
Did you and He Fanxing
switch souls or something?

19
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:50,160
He Fanxing has just started
to become like you,

20
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,800
while you are now making prudent choices?

21
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,880
What do you mean by that?

22
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,400
I have my principles.

23
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,680
I know you too well.

24
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:01,440
You have principles, yet no limits.

25
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:07,280
The girl was even willing
to write you a love letter.

26
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,720
This isn't a simple matter.

27
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,440
You will let your guard down soon.

28
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,720
But we really are not compatible.

29
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:19,240
Unless she is a relative or already taken,

30
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,840
which part of her isn't compatible?

31
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,400
She's too young.

32
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,600
Do you actually consider age?

33
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,760
What about your sister's ex?

34
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:39,120
<i>The favor you asked for has been settled.</i>

35
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,160
<i>Don't forget what you promised me.</i>

36
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,520
-Thank you, Meiyin.
-<i>Okay.</i>

37
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,920
-<i>I'm hanging up now.</i>
-Bye.

38
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:44,960
<i>Bye.</i>

39
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,200
How is it?

40
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,320
Does it smell nice?

41
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,320
What's that smell?

42
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,320
Hello, He Fanxing?

43
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,400
Where are you?

44
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:11,840
Right.

45
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,120
My throat is not feeling well.

46
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,520
Yes, right. All right.

47
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,000
I'll take a bath first.

48
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:20,840
I'll be waiting.

49
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,520
The flowers are here.

50
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,760
-Caiwei?
-Hey.

51
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,480
Come on, Yueyue.

52
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,280
Luming, do you remember me? I'm Du Yue.

53
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,200
-Luming, I'll brew the tea.
-Yes?

54
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,360
Go and talk to Yueyue.

55
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,120
Why didn't you tell me
that you were coming?

56
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,640
You even brought someone with you.

57
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,160
Would you have let me in if I told you?

58
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,080
You said you have someone in mind.

59
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,760
Then why haven't you courted
and introduced her to me?

60
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,720
She really exists and she is with me now.

61
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,520
We have a date today.

62
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,440
Really?

63
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,800
What a coincidence.

64
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,000
You have been courting her for so long.

65
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,800
You finally got her now that I'm here.

66
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,160
Aren't I your lucky star?

67
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:25,880
Stop it.

68
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,520
All right, take your phone out.

69
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:32,160
Call someone to help you.

70
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,880
At least find someone believable,
then perhaps we'll leave.

71
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,480
Caiwei, listen to me...

72
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,560
I know.

73
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,600
You think I'm overbearing.

74
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,120
But what can I do?

75
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,520
Our parents died early.

76
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,400
Your sister has to be your mom.

77
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,680
If I don't help,

78
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,160
Mom and Dad will scold me in my dreams!

79
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,400
Calm down, Caiwei!

80
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,600
We have a guest!

81
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,880
I knew you were a girl with a big heart.

82
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,160
Here, have some tea.

83
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,440
Thank you.

84
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,720
Luming, do you remember?

85
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:19,000
Yueyue is your brother-in-law's cousin.

86
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,560
Yueyue just came back from England.

87
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:24,200
You should meet more
and take care of each other.

88
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,800
I heard that she's a scholar.

89
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,280
What did you mean?

90
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,400
Don't you remember?

91
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,720
You held Yueyue at my wedding.

92
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,120
You wouldn't even let her go.

93
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,440
Really? I must have forgotten.

94
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,120
You were about three years old.

95
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,440
How could you possibly remember?

96
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,400
Your cousin really liked you.

97
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,920
Yes, I took care of many babies.

98
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,560
I took care of Su Li, Qingqing and Xiaoke.

99
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:50,000
My brother-in-law has
lots of siblings with kids.

100
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,440
When the adults were busy,
I took care of the kids.

101
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,920
Yes, but at that time,

102
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,200
Yueyue said,

103
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:00,680
"When I grow up, I'll marry Luming."

104
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,240
He is a man of such good caliber.

105
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,440
There must be plenty of girls
who like him.

106
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:07,920
You're right.

107
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,480
The queue stretches from east to west.

108
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:12,120
That's why I have chosen
the best out of all.

109
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,760
Does Luming have a girlfriend?

110
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,360
He...

111
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,680
What a coincidence.

112
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:24,120
She's coming today. You'll see her soon.

113
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,840
Right, he says that every time.

114
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,360
You know what, Yueyue?

115
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,760
Nowadays, people will use any method

116
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,600
just to avoid blind dates.

117
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:40,080
My sister, my own sister.

118
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:41,919
Forget it then.

119
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,480
My girlfriend is beautiful and elegant.

120
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:48,160
She's like a diamond in the rough.

121
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,800
I'm lucky to have found her.

122
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,760
Why don't you tend to Yueyue?

123
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,960
I'll whip up some dishes.

124
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,640
Stay for lunch.

125
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,680
I'll help you, Luming.

126
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,240
It's okay, you're a guest.

127
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,440
Can you cook?

128
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,800
I always cooked when I was in England.
I can make home-cooked dishes.

129
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,840
I have never tried Yueyue's cooking.

130
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,120
Why don't you show us your skills?

131
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,040
Sure.

132
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,520
Go ahead!

133
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,720
Come and give me a hand then.

134
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:12,760
Left or right hand?

135
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:21,000
<i>You were still in the womb
when I started telling lies.</i>

136
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,600
<i>Do you think you have a chance against me?</i>

137
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,600
Do you know what this is in English?

138
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,320
What is this called again?

139
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,360
Really?

140
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,760
You're so funny.

141
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,280
-This steak...
-Do you like it?

142
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,360
-Yes.
-I'll grab an apron for you.

143
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,520
Okay.

144
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,360
Coming!

145
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,640
Fruits.

146
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,280
My sister is here.

147
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,440
Your biological sister?

148
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,880
That's right, my sister.

149
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,160
She brought her husband's cousin.

150
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,160
She won't even spare her relatives now.

151
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,440
You have to help me. Don't abandon me.

152
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,800
How do I help you?

153
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,680
Should I pretend to be your girlfriend?

154
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,080
What do you mean by pretend?

155
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,600
You are my girlfriend!

156
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,560
Yes, right.

157
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,160
Calm down.

158
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:15,000
You're meeting my family, but don't worry.

159
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,440
She is very nice.

160
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:19,320
Why am I meeting your family?
It's too fast.

161
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,760
Yes, it's definitely unexpected.

162
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,120
But it's not unreasonable.

163
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,120
Take a deep breath.

164
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,080
-I need some air.
-Hey!

165
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,640
Calm down.

166
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,680
Then why don't you pretend
to be my girlfriend?

167
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,280
Just pretend and help me out.

168
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,160
I don't know how your mind works.

169
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,720
We have to be flexible!

170
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,920
Look at me, you can do it.

171
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,880
-You can do it.
-Luming?

172
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,640
Why aren't you coming in?

173
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,320
Is your girlfriend here?

174
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,960
Yes! I'm coming!

175
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,080
Hey!

176
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,120
Caiwei, let me make the introduction.

177
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,080
This is my girlfriend, He Fanxing.

178
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,080
This is my sister, Ye Caiwei.

179
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,560
Nice to meet you.

180
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:13,000
I didn't know you were coming,
so I didn't get you anything.

181
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,640
You don't have to.

182
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,040
Take a seat.

183
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,960
Is black tea okay?

184
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,840
Yes, thank you.

185
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,840
This is Du Yue,
my brother-in-law's cousin.

186
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,960
You're a guest, you don't have to do this.
Please have a seat.

187
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,960
It's fine. Those who are capable
should do more.

188
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,920
Lunch will be ready after one more dish.

189
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,520
-Okay.
-Thank you.

190
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,320
Come and sit.

191
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,800
-Please take a seat.
-Come.

192
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,680
He, I didn't know
that Luming had a girlfriend.

193
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,200
He just told me right before you arrived.

194
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,880
When did you two get together?

195
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,040
Not too long ago, just last week.

196
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,000
I see.

197
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,640
Luming told me he has been courting you
for quite some time.

198
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,960
Yes, but I didn't know he was courting me.

199
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,320
I courted her in a very modest way.

200
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,440
How old are you, He?

201
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,880
Are you from here?
How many are there in your family?

202
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,640
I'm 32 years old.

203
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,120
I am a local.

204
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,720
There are four people in my family.

205
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:29,400
Me, my parents,
and a single younger brother.

206
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,280
They're twins.

207
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:32,560
I see.

208
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,320
You have such good genes!

209
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,080
Twins, how nice.

210
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,960
So you're five years younger than Luming.

211
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,200
That is fitting.

212
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,680
You're not that young anymore.

213
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,440
When are you two getting married?

214
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,520
Married?

215
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:49,920
We haven't reached that stage yet.

216
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,320
Yes, you have to develop romance slowly.

217
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,200
But you still have to plan
your wedding first.

218
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:58,120
It takes a long time to prepare.

219
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,240
Buying, renovating and furnishing
a new house takes half a year.

220
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:05,040
The wedding preparation
takes half a year too.

221
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,800
It will take a year in total.

222
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,160
Caiwei.

223
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,400
This is your first time
meeting each other.

224
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,600
What are you talking about?

225
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:17,200
Now that we have met, we need to hurry up.

226
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:20,880
He, I'm planning
to visit your family soon.

227
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,640
I need to ask your parents' opinions.

228
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,840
I don't know how many betrothal gifts
I should prepare.

229
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,440
Are there any traditions I should know of?

230
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,080
Caiwei.

231
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:31,880
Change the topic.

232
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,920
Let's talk about your honeymoon then.

233
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:35,960
How does that sound?

234
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,920
I'm sorry, Luming.
I interrupted your date.

235
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,480
I should be the one to apologize instead.

236
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,920
You were a guest,
but you had to cook for us.

237
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,080
I'll take you out to a meal next time.

238
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:59,120
Okay, hurry up and get inside.

239
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,960
Are you sure you don't want me
to send you off?

240
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,560
Isn't your girlfriend
waiting for you inside?

241
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,160
She really is my girlfriend.

242
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,520
I believe you! Of course, I do.

243
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,360
You would never lie to me.

244
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,000
All right, Caiwei.

245
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:13,080
-It's getting late, let's go.
-Okay.

246
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:14,760
Bye, Luming.

247
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:15,680
Bye.

248
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,280
Let me do it.

249
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,960
It's fine, I'm almost done.

250
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,120
All clean.

251
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,080
Are you mad?

252
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,160
Don't overthink this.

253
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,480
My sister was getting at me, not you.

254
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:44,320
She thought I was lying again,
so she brought a blind date over.

255
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,240
I hope you're not mad.

256
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,160
I'm not mad.

257
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:55,960
I'm just not prepared for such situations.

258
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,600
I didn't know what to do.

259
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,960
But you did great.

260
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:04,240
We just started dating.

261
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,800
This is purely a one-off accident.

262
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:07,720
Really.

263
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,360
Are you really not mad?

264
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,600
You're really inexperienced.

265
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,560
Your boyfriend had a blind date.

266
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:26,600
You should be mad,
so that I can console you.

267
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,320
It's not your fault.

268
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,360
That's correct, but...

269
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,240
Your boyfriend had a blind date.

270
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,960
You have the right to get angry.

271
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,880
If it's someone you like,

272
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,800
you might not get mad.

273
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:48,040
But you would be jealous.

274
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,840
So were you jealous?

275
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:52,520
No.

276
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:53,720
Didn't you say so?

277
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:56,000
We have only been together for a few days.

278
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:58,880
Yes.

279
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,560
Let's take it slow.

280
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,440
Don't be too enchanted by me.

281
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:08,520
Right, didn't you catch a cold?

282
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,440
You...

283
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,480
You should take your medicine now.

284
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:12,400
Well...

285
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,600
Where's your medicine?

286
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,560
-Let me help you.
-I'll get it.

287
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:17,680
Look out!

288
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,800
I forgot my phone.

289
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,160
Please continue.

290
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,960
Miss, please.

291
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,800
We've waited for the whole day.

292
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,720
Maybe they've gone somewhere else.

293
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:07,800
Let's wait for another half an hour.

294
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,520
We'll leave if we don't see them.

295
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:17,319
Even my phone battery is dead.

296
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,319
Don't leave, Kou!

297
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,480
Listen!

298
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,120
Let me go!

299
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,320
Don't cry.

300
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,120
My heart hurts when I see you cry.

301
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,760
Don't be heartbroken.

302
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,640
Didn't we promise each other?

303
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,480
Once we pass those doors,

304
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:57,080
we'll only be friends.

305
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:36,920
Were you spying on me?

306
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:38,800
Do we even need to?

307
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:42,240
With your brains,
you were lovey-dovey on Weibo

308
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,480
and even tagged the hotel.

309
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,200
KOUKOU123, LOVE YOU

310
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:52,320
Come at me all you want!

311
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,440
Kou is innocent.

312
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,120
I was the one who courted her.

313
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,880
No, it's my fault.

314
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,760
I knew he had a wife,
but I couldn't help it.

315
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,840
I couldn't control myself.

316
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:04,760
Kou.

317
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,880
Can you stop being so kind?

318
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,680
Why aren't you angry at me?

319
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,560
How can I be angry at you?

320
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:12,840
You never lied to me.

321
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:16,160
You said you won't divorce your wife.

322
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,520
It's my fault.

323
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,920
I fell for a married man.

324
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:20,880
Stop!

325
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,480
What are you spewing in front of us?

326
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,040
Are you two looking for a fight?

327
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,760
What a bunch of shameless idiots.

328
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,560
Tell us. How will you fix this?

329
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,960
I came here to break up with Kou.

330
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,080
We will never meet again.

331
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,240
I won't dance anymore.

332
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,600
I'll work hard to feed the family.

333
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:43,720
You know that I'm having my second child.

334
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,880
I'll be responsible
and take care of my family.

335
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:48,440
So you have suffered.

336
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:51,800
Your wife and child
took away your freedom, right?

337
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:52,720
He Canyang.

338
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,600
Can't we have a proper conversation here?

339
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,960
Have you ever seen a person
doing that with an animal?

340
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,160
Does the animal even understand?

341
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,120
I know that you look down on me.

342
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,600
All of you do.

343
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,560
You're just Xiaoyu's friends.

344
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,760
You guys think
that I don't care about my family.

345
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,560
In your eyes, I am nothing.

346
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,040
But I am working hard to feed my family.

347
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:18,120
I bring back all my money home.

348
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:21,000
But no matter how hard I try,
it is never enough.

349
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,640
Then did we force you to have an affair?

350
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,320
It's none of your business!

351
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:29,240
-He Canyang!
-Don't hit him!

352
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:30,480
Stop it!

353
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,240
If he is hurt,
how will he explain to Xiaoyu?

354
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,760
-Didn't you hear what the jerk said?
-I did.

355
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:38,600
He never mentioned Xiaoyu
since we came in.

356
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,400
Shen Fanfan.

357
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:51,280
If you still care for your family
after getting caught,

358
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,320
shouldn't you beg us not to tell Xiaoyu?

359
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:56,400
But what have you been saying
all this while?

360
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,120
You have been protecting your lover

361
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,240
and complaining
about how you're suffering!

362
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:01,640
I...

363
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:05,240
-I just--
-You just don't think about others!

364
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:07,120
You only think about yourself!

365
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,760
If you had never met Xiaoyu,

366
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:12,560
would you have become
a professional dancer?

367
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:16,800
You can only coax and deceive
these young and innocent girls in class!

368
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,280
We're not professional dancers.

369
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,960
We just love dancing.

370
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,960
Should we be looked down upon for that?

371
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,200
Young lady, your line of thinking
is really something.

372
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:33,800
The fact that you're being looked down on
has nothing to do with being dancers.

373
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:38,640
It is because you seduced a married man!

374
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,880
We won't hit you, Shen Fanfan.

375
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,880
That's because we obey the law.

376
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,320
It's not because of
what you did is respectable.

377
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,240
Do you understand?

378
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:54,280
Professor Song, I was wrong.

379
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,840
But I really suffer when I get home.

380
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,480
I can't bear Xiaoyu's glares.

381
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:03,000
It's like she is always forcing me
to grow up.

382
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:06,720
It's like I can't have my own life
after having a child.

383
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,480
I'm really tired.

384
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:10,520
Right.

385
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:15,560
Normal people with children
can't live their life freely,

386
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,520
but you're free enough.

387
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:21,520
You play ball and dance on weekends.

388
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,560
You can even have an affair
during your business trip.

389
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:28,120
Who do you think
is taking care of the family

390
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,440
for you to have such freedom and time?

391
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:39,960
Professor Song.

392
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,240
I'm repenting now.

393
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:45,120
Can you not tell Xiaoyu?

394
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,320
I'll change.

395
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:48,000
I will never do this again.

396
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,720
I'll be good to Xiaoyu.

397
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:54,160
I won't tell her.

398
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:58,280
She's giving birth soon,
so she needs to be in a good environment.

399
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:01,760
Find a suitable time and tell her
after the birth and confinement period.

400
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:05,440
If she forgives you,
you'll take care of her.

401
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:08,440
But if you don't tell her...

402
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,120
I'll tell her for you.

403
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:13,800
Professor Song, please.

404
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,600
Please don't tell her.

405
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,160
I know I was wrong.

406
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,440
I have broken up with Kou.

407
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,120
I really admit that I was wrong.

408
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,160
What you said was right.

409
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:32,400
We're Xiaoyu's friends, not yours.

410
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:33,840
So...

411
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:38,240
The decision to forgive you
lies entirely in Xiaoyu's hands.

412
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,840
Not in yours,
since you betrayed your marriage.

413
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,040
Professor Song! Professor--

414
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,040
Enough.

415
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:47,760
This girl is good.

416
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,520
She didn't even use perfume around you.

417
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,120
It's just that she's a little foolish.

418
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:52,840
Go on with your date.

419
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:53,920
See you around.

420
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:18,360
Take it easy.

421
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,720
It's not your husband who cheated.

422
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,480
Why are you so worked up?

423
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:26,080
The more I think about it,
the angrier I get.

424
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,440
Those who cheat
when their wives are pregnant

425
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:29,560
are the absolute scums!

426
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,520
You're right!

427
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,880
Then why did you stop me
from beating him up?

428
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:36,640
If Xiaoyu doesn't forgive him,
we will slap him hard across the face!

429
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:37,560
Good!

430
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,320
We should hit him hard.

431
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,000
But promise me something.

432
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,680
Don't act like this
when you are home later.

433
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:49,320
Dongyang is going to misunderstand
and I'll be slapped to death instead.

434
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,840
Enough already, let's go.

435
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,280
-Promise me.
-Yes, just get going!

436
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:15,760
ENJOY LIFE THOROUGHLY,
FILL YOUR GOLDEN CUP WITH WINE

437
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,240
Goodness.

438
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,160
What do you think?

439
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,680
It's well written.

440
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,320
You're still incredible.

441
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,880
I meant the poem.

442
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,120
The poem is even better.

443
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:37,000
Then why did you praise my calligraphy
and not the poem?

444
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,280
Everyone knows that the poem is good.

445
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,880
Of course, my first opinion
would be on your calligraphy.

446
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,440
Dad, are you arguing with me?

447
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:49,200
No praise is needed if it's good.

448
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,720
Who taught you that?

449
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:53,320
When you were young,

450
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,680
I praised you whenever I had the chance.

451
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,760
I know you're the best.

452
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:00,880
Dad is the best.

453
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,200
Then is Mom the worst?

454
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,840
Mom is the best too.

455
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:14,040
But she cares too much
about what other people think.

456
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:19,640
My daughter, let me tell you a secret.

457
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:24,360
Every time your mom visits your aunt,

458
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,960
your aunt tries to be a matchmaker.

459
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:32,120
She even berates your mom
for not taking care of you two.

460
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,920
Your mom never cared.

461
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,880
It goes in one ear and out the other.

462
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:38,400
If you and Canyang go to your aunt's house

463
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:41,080
and she starts to nag,

464
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:46,040
your mom will definitely jump at her
and break all ties.

465
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:49,720
Back then,

466
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,400
your mom took care of you two
like nothing else.

467
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,760
Now that she's old

468
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:58,360
and getting weaker,

469
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:01,120
she's anxious and sensitive.

470
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:04,160
She is not as energetic
as she was back then.

471
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,840
After working hard all day,

472
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:09,720
she goes straight to bed
and sleeps all the way until the morning.

473
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,640
She's at that age

474
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:15,240
where she can no longer
follow your footsteps and way of thinking.

475
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,160
Don't despise her.

476
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:22,400
When you were young,

477
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:25,880
didn't your mom feed you
spoonful by spoonful at every meal

478
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:28,280
and teach you how to speak?

479
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,280
When you and Canyang made mistakes,

480
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:33,040
she would teach you two
what was right and wrong.

481
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:34,880
Right?

482
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:38,400
Has she ever despised both of you
and thought that you were frustrating?

483
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,640
So now...

484
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,560
It's your turn to coax her gently.

485
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,880
<i>I never thought</i>

486
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:55,440
<i>that moms also need to be coaxed</i>

487
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:57,560
<i>with nice words.</i>

488
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:02,280
<i>We can see how much she did
when she was in front of us.</i>

489
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:06,080
<i>But how much did she do</i>

490
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,840
<i>when she was behind us?</i>

491
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,440
<i>She did everything for us</i>

492
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:17,840
<i>with the effort and energy
that can hold up the world.</i>

493
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,240
<i>And I</i>

494
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:25,360
<i>have never thought
about all that effort and energy.</i>

495
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,480
<i>Time has left its traces on Mom's face.</i>

496
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:31,560
<i>She keeps smiling</i>

497
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,400
<i>and smiling,</i>

498
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:35,880
<i>until her back bends,</i>

499
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,600
<i>her eyesight worsens,</i>

500
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,960
<i>and wrinkles creep on her face.</i>

501
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,360
<i>Over time,</i>

502
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,040
<i>she will become a child.</i>

503
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:50,080
<i>And over time,</i>

504
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:52,520
<i>I'll become her mom,</i>

505
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:57,280
<i>becoming the effort and energy
needed in her life.</i>

506
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:04,760
Mom.

507
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,280
You're back.

508
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,840
-I'll make you something to eat.
-No.

509
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,520
It's fine.

510
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,160
You must be tired.

511
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:23,120
Go and get some rest.

512
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:26,840
Mom.

513
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,360
I'm sorry.

514
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,840
I shouldn't have fought with you.

515
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,200
Silly girl.

516
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,920
I have forgotten about it.

517
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,760
-Dad, Mom, I'm off to work.
-All right.

518
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:30,960
Is Luming picking you up?

519
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:33,360
Yes, he's already in the neighborhood.

520
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,280
I'm off!

521
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,040
She's just like a child.

522
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,200
That's right.

523
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,040
She had her lipstick on.

524
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,000
Is my face...

525
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,600
What about me?

526
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,920
Are you laughing at me?

527
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,360
You look happy.

528
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,080
What happened?

529
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:25,120
I have nothing to be unhappy about.

530
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:28,440
My family is healthy,

531
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,240
I have a job,

532
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:32,080
and someone is taking me to work.

533
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:35,920
Then let me add something
to your happiness.

534
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:38,040
I'm treating your colleagues to dinner.

535
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,640
Give me the head count
so that I can make a reservation.

536
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:43,840
Tonight?

537
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:44,920
Yes.

538
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:47,320
I promised Cong Xiao
I would buy them dinner tonight.

539
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:52,840
All right.

540
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,080
Hey.

541
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,920
Why do you look reluctant?

542
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:01,960
I'm not.

543
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:05,920
We have only been together for a few days.

544
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:09,840
You're buying my colleagues dinner,
and I was forced to meet your sister.

545
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:12,480
Such a huge leap in a relationship

546
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,320
is a little...

547
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,400
A little...

548
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:19,960
What are you trying to say?

549
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:23,760
Who told you to have coffee with your ex
and not reply to my text?

550
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:27,880
It's my fault.

551
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,840
Has your ex-boyfriend resigned yet?

552
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:37,160
Yes, he handed in his resignation
last Friday.

553
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:44,640
Actually, it's okay if he joins us.

554
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:47,440
If exes can be friends,

555
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:50,040
that means there wasn't even
an actual relationship after all.

556
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,880
No love or hatred.

557
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,840
It wasn't even etched in one's heart.

558
00:32:56,400 --> 00:33:00,200
After this,
we probably won't meet each other again.

559
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:02,880
It doesn't matter
if we continue to be friends or not.

560
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:06,440
He must have a lot of friends too.

561
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:10,840
Maybe you can like his posts.

562
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,960
I don't think so.

563
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,560
He's too young

564
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:23,040
and a little bit narrow-minded.

565
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:33,480
YUAN SONG LIKES YOUR POST

566
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:46,360
<i>I miss your mom's cooking.
I'll go to your place sometime.</i>

567
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,280
ENTER

568
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:55,240
Paintings are a path to history.

569
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:57,800
It's proof of civilization.

570
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:01,240
<i>Nymph of the Luo River</i>
was drawn by Gu Kaizhi,

571
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:03,040
a famous Eastern Jin poet and artist.

572
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:05,960
It's based on Cao Zhi's
<i>Rhapsody of the Goddess Luo</i>.

573
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:09,360
In a way, it's like how artists today
create illustrations

574
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:12,600
similar to what is in
current magazines and journals.

575
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:17,480
Gu Kaizhi can be considered
as someone who drew ancient fan art.

576
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:23,800
His courtesy name was Changkang
and was nicknamed Hutou.

577
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,880
He was a Han who came from Wuxi.

578
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:29,239
Gu Kaizhi was extremely talented
in poetry, calligraphy,

579
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:30,800
and painting.

580
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:34,440
He excelled in drawing portraits,
Buddha, animals, and sceneries.

581
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:36,199
He was known as Master of Three Traits.

582
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:38,600
-Painting, poetry, love.
-You speak when it's our turn.

583
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:40,199
-You do it.
-Just do it.

584
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,560
Sure, if you'll be my girlfriend.

585
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,400
Not bad.

586
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:08,240
Appreciation of art
is the communication of content.

587
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:10,840
Regardless of the language and method,

588
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,800
an artwork is successful
if it leaves an impression.

589
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,480
Not bad! Next group.

590
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,840
Liu Zhanni, Cai Minmin, and Yu Da.

591
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:31,040
Our fellow classmates
introduced famous artworks

592
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:33,120
from Eastern Jin, Eastern Han,
Northern Song,

593
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,200
and the Renaissance.

594
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:37,680
Our group will be introducing

595
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:40,960
the modern artist Xu Beihong's artwork,
<i>The Galloping Horse</i>.

596
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:44,800
Xu Beihong, 1895 to 1953.

597
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,320
His real name was Xu Shoukang.

598
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,480
He was an outstanding artist
and art educator.

599
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,320
I didn't know I was so talented.

600
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:57,960
Why don't I just become an announcer?

601
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:00,720
I wonder if I can change
to the broadcasting course.

602
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,280
Why didn't you agree
to my proposal just now?

603
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:05,160
What proposal?

604
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:06,440
Forget it.

605
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:07,720
Don't dwell on the past.

606
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,360
Am I not good enough?

607
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:10,880
You have a big head!

608
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:12,920
I never criticized your big face!

609
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,360
-Big Head!
-What?

610
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:15,880
-Are you out of your mind?
-What?

611
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:19,920
-Your head is bigger, Big Head!
-I'm telling you to let go!

612
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,800
-Let go!
-Come with me.

613
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,960
Spit it out. What is it now?

614
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,800
I thought you were just a playboy.

615
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:42,160
Who knew that you were such a jerk!

616
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,600
Am I a jerk for rejecting you?

617
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:48,240
Wouldn't that prove that I have morals?

618
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:52,160
Who did you spend the weekend with?

619
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:53,240
My family.

620
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:54,800
You're a liar!

621
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,800
You went to a hotel with Professor Song!

622
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,440
How did you know?

623
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:00,960
Do you admit it?

624
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:04,560
Look at the way the cup was held!

625
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,840
I instantly knew it was you!

626
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,200
It's a misunderstanding.

627
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:16,160
We went there for a reason.

628
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:19,480
If you're that high and mighty,
why did you say that you were home?

629
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:20,680
OF COURSE, I'M AT HOME

630
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:27,640
If you have morals,
then no one on Earth is a good person!

631
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:29,280
You sully the reputation of teachers!

632
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:31,080
I'll report you to the principal!

633
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,560
-What's going on?
-Hey!

634
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:38,440
Just in time, Professor Song.

635
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:41,400
Explain to her what we did this weekend.

636
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,080
Why should I?

637
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:45,440
It's all because of your post
when we were in the lobby.

638
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:48,120
Ms. Cai Minmin thinks that
we're having a fling.

639
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,280
A fling?

640
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:52,680
Me and him?

641
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:57,960
You weren't there to play mahjong,
were you?

642
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:03,680
Come here, I'll show you something.

643
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:09,720
Come here.
Don't you want to know what we did?

644
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:21,640
<i>Professor Song.</i>

645
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:24,680
<i>How many marriages rely only on love?</i>

646
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:26,680
<i>It's the children.</i>

647
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:29,040
<i>I'm doing it for the children.
I don't want to divorce Xiaoyu.</i>

648
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,840
<i>Professor Song, I know I was wrong.</i>

649
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,480
<i>I really broke up with Kou.</i>

650
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:35,720
<i>Please don't ruin my family, okay?</i>

651
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,560
<i>I'm not human. I'm a scum.</i>

652
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:42,200
<i>Why don't you and He Canyang
beat me up for Xiaoyu?</i>

653
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,440
<i>Professor Song, please pick up my calls.</i>

654
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,000
What is this?

655
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:51,080
There are cameras in the lobby.

656
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:53,680
We were at the café for the whole day.

657
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,760
At around 10:30 a.m. and 3:00 p.m.,

658
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:58,280
two fans recognized me

659
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:00,200
and took photos with me.

660
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,880
Just search for my name online.

661
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,840
This man texted me around 11:00 p.m.

662
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:08,080
We had already left the hotel by then.

663
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:10,720
Try and connect all the dots.

664
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,800
Our great detective, Ms. Cai Minmin,

665
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:16,880
what do you think we did at the hotel?

666
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,560
Why are you testing me?

667
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:25,640
Your answer will determine
your end of semester results.

668
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,960
Let me have another look.

669
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:32,920
Was he having an affair?

670
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:37,200
So what do you think
we were doing at the hotel?

671
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:44,000
You two were in the hotel lobby
for the entire day

672
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,080
to catch this guy
for this lady named Xiaoyu?

673
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:49,760
Not bad, Cai Minmin.

674
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,640
Good deductive skills.

675
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,520
So were you catching an unfaithful man.

676
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:59,560
Xiaoyu has been our best friend
since high school.

677
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:02,840
She even pulled Professor He's hair out
while giving birth to her first child.

678
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:06,200
Professor He is that kind of man.

679
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:09,400
He is always misunderstood
because he looks like that.

680
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:12,960
But you shouldn't judge a book
by its cover.

681
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:13,880
Do you understand?

682
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:19,000
I acted on impulse.

683
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:22,120
It's fine. I'm used to it.

684
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:23,480
Go home.

685
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,800
-Professor He...
-It's okay.

686
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:28,040
Professor He is very understanding.

687
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:29,760
He won't be angry,
so you should just leave.

688
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:33,760
Then, I'll take my leave.

689
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:37,480
Go home, study,
and stop checking the posts.

690
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:38,400
Okay?

691
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:42,440
I won't do it again.

692
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:44,960
Good girl.

693
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,760
She's a silly girl, but she's quite cute.

694
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:00,720
What a lovable girl.

695
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,240
She's so fun.

696
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:06,160
"I won't do it again."

697
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:07,680
-Did she do this?
-Yes.

698
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:14,960
Hello, He Fanxing speaking.

699
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:18,840
A new employee is coming?

700
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:23,040
Okay, let him come and see me directly.

701
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:24,880
Yes, I'll create his profile.

702
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:26,880
Okay.

703
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,360
START

704
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:01,600
Yuan Song was here for so long.

705
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:04,960
It's kind of sad now that he has left.

706
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:08,840
Didn't he come for an internship?

707
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:10,760
There are many interns every year.

708
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:12,920
I am already used to them
coming in and out.

709
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:15,720
You're really committed to your work.

710
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:19,120
I thought you would be different
with Yuan Song.

711
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:20,760
You were very nice to him.

712
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:24,000
The way to be good to them

713
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:27,960
is to wish them all the best
at securing a job somewhere better.

714
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:30,880
I see.

715
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:35,680
It became a wolf.

716
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:38,360
Don't they have claws?

717
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:40,640
This one is better.

718
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:41,840
It's not that cold.

719
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:44,920
I'm done. Your turn.

720
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:51,200
-Qingqing.
-Yes?

721
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:53,720
A new employee is coming in.

722
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:56,560
Please clear this table
from top to bottom.

723
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:58,320
Okay, I'll get it done.

724
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:01,440
Ms. He.

725
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:04,960
I have booked the table for tonight,
but they have limited seats.

726
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:06,320
There are six of us, right?

727
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:07,920
Please check the head count.

728
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,840
Me, Chang Huan, Bai, Cong Xiao,

729
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:12,200
Ms. He and Ms. He's boyfriend.

730
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:13,440
-Six!
-Okay.

731
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:14,560
-Then--
-Count me in.

732
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:19,600
