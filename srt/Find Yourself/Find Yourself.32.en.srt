1
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,280
Don't sleep.

2
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,200
The anesthesia will wear off in an hour.

3
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,640
Hang in there.

4
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,960
I can't take it anymore.

5
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,760
Still feel dopey?

6
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,480
If you fall asleep again,

7
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,920
I'll pinch your hand.

8
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,720
What's wrong? Too shocked to speak?

9
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,120
If I feel dopey,

10
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,160
I'll pinch you.

11
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,920
I'm not dopey. Why would you pinch me?

12
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,480
Has the drug made you silly?

13
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,240
Try this.

14
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,320
-Thank you, Mrs. He.
-You're welcome.

15
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:55,040
Keeping two dogs is the same
as keeping one.

16
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,160
It was no bother.

17
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,640
I think so too.

18
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,880
Braised Meat has put on weight
under your care.

19
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,160
Of course!

20
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,960
I purposely prepare healthy food for them.

21
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,320
We have Australian T-bone steaks
in the fridge.

22
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,360
We can't eat those. They are for the dogs.

23
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,360
Other people have grandchildren.
Well, so do I.

24
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,160
Is there anything wrong with that?

25
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,480
Not a thing.

26
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:20,800
Yuan Song, here. Try this.

27
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,079
It's too far.

28
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,440
-Help yourself.
-Mom.

29
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,760
Yes? I'll cook for you tomorrow.

30
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,120
Here you go.

31
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,080
Aren't you old enough to share?

32
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:39,800
Even if they turn 50,
they're still kids to me.

33
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,840
Keep spoiling her.

34
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,320
Keep it up until she's 50.

35
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,440
I'll be happy to.

36
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,440
Just eat.

37
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,480
Fanxing.

38
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:52,560
Didn't you say that you went
to view houses with Luming?

39
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,160
How was it?

40
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,560
Right. I haven't asked you. Do tell.

41
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,000
What's there to tell?

42
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,520
He's the one viewing the house, not me.

43
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,760
Each was over tens of millions.

44
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,120
He won't decide so soon.

45
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,280
Tens of millions?

46
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,760
The houses must be quite big.

47
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:11,960
Yes.

48
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,560
Where are they located?

49
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,400
One is by the river.

50
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,880
One is in the suburbs.

51
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,040
Jeez.

52
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,480
The suburbs are really far.

53
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,240
Is it a school district?

54
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:24,880
I don't know.

55
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,200
See that?

56
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,000
Just a few questions
is enough to get under her skin.

57
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,800
All right. I'll stop asking.

58
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,360
I'll ask Luming myself.

59
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,520
Mom.

60
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,680
Why would you do that?

61
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,960
It would seem
as though I've said something,

62
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:42,880
and you have issues
on his decision about his own house.

63
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,040
I won't ask.

64
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,320
I was just saying.

65
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,760
Fanxing is right.

66
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,760
He sees you as his future mother-in-law.

67
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:56,200
Your questions are too sensitive.

68
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,680
-I--
-Mrs. He.

69
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,000
Have some fish. It's really good.

70
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,320
It's good, right? Eat some more then.

71
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,480
Look, there are no bones here.

72
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,720
Here, have some.

73
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,360
Need help?

74
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,000
Sure.

75
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,080
Here you go.

76
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,240
Mosquito bite?

77
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,720
That's right.

78
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:34,120
Don't you want to know
about the dinner with my dad?

79
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,480
How did it go?

80
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:40,400
I took your advice
and talked things out with him.

81
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:43,400
I won't eat with him again
for the next few months.

82
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,720
Why?

83
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,480
My dad's ears are filled with concrete.

84
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,840
He won't listen to me.

85
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,040
I'm thinking of moving.

86
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,600
It's that serious?

87
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,080
Yes, I felt more secure
when he didn't know where I lived.

88
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,800
Guess what he got me?

89
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,280
What?

90
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:03,120
He sent me a Harvard encyclopedia
on business management.

91
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,320
And he will get more.

92
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,080
Such a stubborn man is hard to come by.

93
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:13,680
He's so stubborn that not even air

94
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,360
can get through to him.

95
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,520
Even rich kids have troubles too.

96
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,080
What a relief.

97
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,720
What the heck? Stop it!

98
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:27,840
Stop it!

99
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,040
-Hey!
-Stop it!

100
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:34,200
Are you two getting back together?

101
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,000
Say one more word
and I'll have you killed!

102
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,360
Look how vicious you are.

103
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,920
I wonder what those guys see in you.

104
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,720
Do you have a death wish?

105
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,800
-Come here!
-Fanxing.

106
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:52,840
Fanxing, I'm sorry.

107
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:53,880
Fanxing.

108
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,640
Where are you going?

109
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,160
Mom!

110
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,200
You two are so annoying.

111
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:03,360
-Fight outside. I'm watching TV.
-Mom, he always bags on me!

112
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,040
-Enough, Fanxing.
-Stop!

113
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,280
-Help me, Dad!
-You'll yank off his hair!

114
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,080
Will you do it again? Tell me!

115
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,760
Knock it off!

116
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:18,720
He Fanxing is really too violent.

117
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,000
Seriously, I've never seen her so mad.

118
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,080
I grew up being beaten by her.

119
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,920
I didn't tell you
because I'm your lecturer.

120
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,360
It's embarrassing.
Secondly, she's your boss.

121
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,600
I can't ruin her image.

122
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,080
She never hit you?

123
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,520
I bet she never did.

124
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,640
You wouldn't forget if she did.

125
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,120
It's so exciting.

126
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,440
Like instance dungeons in games
that's beyond my level.

127
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,520
Do you still have feelings for her?

128
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,280
You might be mad at me,

129
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,840
but the fact is...

130
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,680
Why would I be mad?

131
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,400
I have no right to be mad.

132
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:06,800
What do you mean?

133
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,640
My current situation

134
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,640
is like the scene
in Théodore Gudin's painting,

135
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,360
<i>Loss of The East Indiaman Kent.</i>

136
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,120
Is it going to capsize?

137
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,640
That's right, Mom!

138
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:32,080
I never knew working as a waitress
was so tough.

139
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,160
I almost broke my arms!

140
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,600
That's right.

141
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,160
My legs hurt even more!

142
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,280
All that smiling almost gave me wrinkles!

143
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,800
Got it. I won't be a baby about it.

144
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,720
Uncle, my mom is asking for you.

145
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:57,760
Hello.

146
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,960
<i>How did the house viewing with Fanxing go?</i>

147
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,640
Well...

148
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,320
I think I shouldn't have brought her.

149
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,120
She's sensitive. She'll overthink.

150
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,160
<i>Come on. That's the point!</i>

151
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:14,840
<i>You want not only her,
but also her family to overthink.</i>

152
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,240
<i>Show them how sincere you are.</i>

153
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,160
<i>The world will be on your side.</i>

154
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,400
We'll see.

155
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,080
It threw me off balance now.

156
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,320
<i>Don't be.</i>

157
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,640
<i>Stay steady.</i>

158
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,160
<i>I don't think you should get a loan.</i>

159
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:30,240
<i>Buy a nicer house with full payment.</i>

160
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,920
<i>If money's an issue,
I can lend some to you.</i>

161
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,320
All right. That's great.

162
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,880
I'm working out.

163
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,640
I've got to go. Talk to Minmin.

164
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,520
All right.

165
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,280
I won't give Uncle trouble.

166
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,920
Good night, Mom.

167
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,480
Uncle.

168
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,800
Did you have a fight with Fanxing?

169
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,240
Why? You want us to fight?

170
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,200
No.

171
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:04,720
But I heard it's not good
if a couple never fights.

172
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,560
You're like an old couple
who has been together for decades.

173
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,840
There's no youthful passion at all.

174
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,640
What's wrong?

175
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,120
Is there only one type of relationship?

176
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,760
There are platonic and sexual ones.

177
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,160
Apparently, there are also those

178
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,680
who likes playing house like you.

179
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,360
What do you mean by playing house?

180
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,880
Your boyfriend only takes you out
to play claw machines,

181
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,880
play video games, or have dinner.

182
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,520
On second thought,

183
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,560
it's not playing house,

184
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:39,200
but more like keeping a pet.

185
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,000
You...

186
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,800
Now, I'm pissed!

187
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,640
If you're mad, there's still hope.

188
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,120
Just break up with your useless boyfriend.

189
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,120
Wait tables at the Italian place.

190
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:57,800
Pick it up.

191
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,320
Or go back home.

192
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,480
When you're old, and you drop
your chopsticks, I won't pick them up!

193
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,080
Buckle up.

194
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,680
What's wrong?

195
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,120
Tell me.

196
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:41,600
Are you hungry?

197
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,480
We can eat before hiking.

198
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,720
You always take me to eat.
Are you feeding a pig?

199
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,240
Am I not?

200
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,640
You always eat so much.

201
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,600
-I'm still growing.
-All right.

202
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,280
Take your time. What do you want to eat?

203
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,640
I have no appetite now!

204
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:01,920
Besides eating and having fun,
can't we do something else?

205
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,200
What else can we do on a date?

206
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,400
Go to the movies?

207
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,960
Fine. You tell me.

208
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,520
Let's go to a motel!

209
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,600
I don't want to.

210
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,000
Why?

211
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,520
We're dating. Why can't we go to a motel?

212
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,280
We've just started dating.

213
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:32,080
Then, why do you casually
go to motels with your exes,

214
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,320
but not with me?

215
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:34,840
Hiking my foot.

216
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,680
Are we really playing house?

217
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:41,480
Who told you I casually went
to motels with my exes?

218
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:47,040
Do you think I keep changing girlfriends
just to sleep around?

219
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,520
Don't you?

220
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,320
Get off the car.

221
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:59,080
I'm not in the mood today.
Reflect on yourself.

222
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,800
It's fine if you're not.

223
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,200
Get off the car!

224
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,720
Come on. Why do you get angry so easily?

225
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,040
Leave.

226
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,800
Professor He, I'm sorry.

227
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:13,880
Let go.

228
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,320
I'll reflect on myself now.

229
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,080
I'll be on mute, okay?

230
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,280
I'll speak only with your permission.

231
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,120
Aren't we going hiking?

232
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,800
I love hiking.

233
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,840
Look, I'm wearing sports shoes.

234
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,800
And I brought Nongfu spring water.

235
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:34,960
With a sports cap.

236
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:38,640
When I was a kid,
being a mountaineer was my dream.

237
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,680
Weren't you on mute?

238
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,480
Professor Song, welcome to Natural Beauty.

239
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,560
Your room is ready.

240
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:02,760
-This way, please.
-Okay.

241
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,240
-Welcome.
-Welcome.

242
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,320
NATURAL BEAUTY SPA FLAGSHIP STORE

243
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:11,600
<i>Professor Song, you look tired today.
Are you just finished with the set?</i>

244
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:14,560
<i>We'll use NB1 Brightening
and Repair Essence</i>

245
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:17,000
<i>to restore and brighten your skin's sheen.</i>

246
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,200
Song Xue, when I was on my way here,

247
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:35,560
I saw that the couple on
our show today were still fighting.

248
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,920
We've shot too many adulterous affairs
on the show lately.

249
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,120
It's getting old.

250
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:43,080
The audience loves it.

251
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,720
It's a safe and easy choice.

252
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:49,240
The only risk is
the guests may fight on set.

253
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,840
Let's go grab a bite later. My treat.

254
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,520
Okay.

255
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,720
But you treated me last time.
It'll be my treat today.

256
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,280
Okay.

257
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,880
I'll use the face lift machines
to infuse essence into your skin.

258
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,440
Song Xue, by the way,

259
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:14,960
who is that person
that has been spamming your Weibo?

260
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,800
Which best friend of yours was cheated on?

261
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,720
Sorry, can you stop for a bit
and get my phone? Thank you.

262
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,880
<i>Song Xue, you saw my messages.
Why didn't you reply?</i>

263
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:37,240
<i>Did you tell your bestie about the affair?
Why is her husband totally fine?</i>

264
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,280
<i>You have your own show.</i>

265
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,480
<i>Why don't you ask them to be on the show?</i>

266
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,960
<i>Shen Fanfan, your wife is pregnant
with her second child! You'll be sorry!</i>

267
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:51,240
<i>Song Xue, this is proof of his affair.</i>

268
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:56,800
-All right, that's it for today.
-Okay.

269
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:01,640
Fatty, sorry. I have an emergency.
I'll treat you next time.

270
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:02,960
Sure. Go ahead.

271
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:06,839
That was it for the facial care.
I'll apply peptide emulsion now.

272
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,760
SHEN FANFAN

273
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,160
Hello.

274
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,040
I know!

275
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,680
SONG XUE

276
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,120
SONG XUE
ONE MISSED CALL

277
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,640
Fanxing, are you busy?

278
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,880
I can't explain over the phone.

279
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,320
Let's meet up in a bit.

280
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,120
Why are you crying?

281
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,160
That will do, right?

282
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:35,920
Playing house?

283
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,320
Who has time for that?

284
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:42,760
Did you pull the nail out?

285
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,200
What?

286
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,640
I've fastened a nail on my lips.

287
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:50,760
A nail?

288
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,720
You meant that nail?

289
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:01,640
I've never stayed silent
for such a long time.

290
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:03,920
I wanted to cry.

291
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,960
But if I don't speak,

292
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,880
will you reward me with a kiss?

293
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,520
What kind of reward is that?

294
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,000
I like you a lot.

295
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,920
So, of course, your kiss is a reward.

296
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:24,840
If I do something right,
you'll reward me, right?

297
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,240
You're groveling to me. Do you know that?

298
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:29,920
I like you a lot.

299
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,120
That's why I grovel to you.

300
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:33,720
And you reward me.

301
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,560
Isn't that how it works?

302
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:42,520
When two people are together,
they should be equal.

303
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:46,360
Rewarding and groveling
are for a pet and its owner.

304
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:49,040
Not for lovers. Get it?

305
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:54,920
But how can we be equal?

306
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,320
If you're mad,

307
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,360
you can ignore me

308
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,560
and kick me out of the car.

309
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,240
But if I'm mad,

310
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,720
and I just walk away,

311
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,720
you won't be bothered at all.

312
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,280
You're older,

313
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,880
smarter,

314
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,840
and know more than I do.

315
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:18,840
As for me...

316
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,680
I'm bad at studying

317
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:23,760
and lazy.

318
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,040
I spend a lot

319
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,320
and eat a lot.

320
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,720
I'm so unattractive.

321
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,360
I'm sorry.

322
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:50,760
I won't kick you out
if I ever get angry again.

323
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:52,600
It's my fault.

324
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,560
See?

325
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,040
I'm over 30.

326
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,440
But I keep doing stupid things.

327
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,240
I'm not as smart as you say.

328
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:06,600
And you're not as bad as you think.

329
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:11,440
If you're unattractive,
why would I fall under your spell?

330
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:17,800
You fell under my spell?

331
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:19,960
Really?

332
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,120
You're finally falling for me?

333
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,240
How cute!

334
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,200
Why are you so cute?

335
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,600
You really treat me like a pet pig!

336
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,280
Why pig?

337
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,840
Tell me! Did you fall for me?

338
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Let's eat elsewhere.

339
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:37,480
Tell me!

340
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,520
We're going. Sit tight.

341
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,720
I want one roasted chicken.

342
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,520
A whole chicken, not half.

343
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,280
Plus whipped potatoes,

344
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,560
a salmon salad

345
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:06,840
and a seafood pizza.

346
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:08,680
That's all.

347
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Is it enough?

348
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:13,800
Yes, that will do. I'm on a diet.

349
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,560
-I want a spaghetti bolognese.
-Okay.

350
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:20,480
You don't have to diet. You're not fat.

351
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:21,720
I'm good.

352
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,680
You're still growing, my dear.

353
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:25,840
Eat more.

354
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,160
We can order more later.

355
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,840
Okay. Where are we going later?

356
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,040
Canyang!

357
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:33,880
Canyang!

358
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,320
Come on.

359
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:42,880
What a coincidence!

360
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,000
That's right.

361
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,040
Let me introduce you.

362
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:49,760
This is my ex, He Canyang.
This is my boyfriend, Binbin.

363
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:52,440
-Hello.
-Is this your girlfriend?

364
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:53,640
Yes.

365
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,480
She's so young.

366
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,720
I'm not young. I'm 20 years old.

367
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,240
I'm Cai Minmin.

368
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:01,080
Hello. I'm Yang Dongya.

369
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:04,120
Since we ran into each other,
do you mind...

370
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,240
-if we join you?
-Of course...

371
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,560
-not.
-Great.

372
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,160
Sit!

373
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:25,280
This is a great coincidence.
Let's order a wine.

374
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,760
Their red wine is good.

375
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:28,760
Waitress!

376
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:31,560
Shantu red wine.

377
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:32,640
-Sure.
-Thank you.

378
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,120
Cheers!

379
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:45,120
When we were together,
he loved to take me hiking.

380
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,760
And I ended up enjoying it.

381
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,800
Twice. Only twice.

382
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:54,240
I used to think that
hiking was tiring and boring.

383
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:55,800
And bars were more fun.

384
00:23:55,960 --> 00:24:00,120
But Canyang said we can feel the changes
of seasons in the mountains.

385
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,720
That's right.

386
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:06,280
Did you only go hiking
when you were dating?

387
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:07,840
Of course not.

388
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:12,280
We went shopping, watched movies,
exercised, and had picnics.

389
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,720
-So healthy?
-Yes.

390
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,240
Aren't you the same?

391
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,600
About the same.

392
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:23,200
When I was with him,
I thought he was a carnivore.

393
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:26,520
To my surprise,
he's actually an innocent herbivore.

394
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,080
He even took me to operas
and art exhibitions.

395
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:33,120
He's very thoughtful
when it comes to dating.

396
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,160
That's why I couldn't get over him.

397
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,840
But you're with me now.

398
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,800
Yes, you're not bad too.

399
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:44,080
How did you meet?

400
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,640
Us?

401
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,800
We're neighbors and childhood friends.

402
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,840
But we never thought of dating.

403
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:52,440
I broke up with my ex
about the same time you did.

404
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,760
Then, we hung out a lot.

405
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:58,440
I thought about it carefully.

406
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:01,160
Then, I realized he's the only one
who doesn't think I'm chatty.

407
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,560
At first, it did bother me.

408
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:06,200
But I got used to it.

409
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:08,200
If you stopped, I'd feel odd.

410
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:19,320
We'll make a move first. Let's meet again.

411
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,120
Minmin, keep in touch.

412
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:26,040
Sure. Dongya, Binbin, bye.

413
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:28,480
Bye. Thank you for the lunch.

414
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:29,880
Bye.

415
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,320
You girls hit it off so fast.

416
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,200
We have a common topic.

417
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,600
Herbivore.

418
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,360
It's Rainbow Doll and Teddy.

419
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,040
What are they doing?

420
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,320
Drinking water, I guess.

421
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,560
She lives here alone. It's not easy.

422
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,200
She was sick and alone.

423
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,520
She also had to work.

424
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,520
I was giving her meds.

425
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,520
It was an accident.

426
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:27,720
An accident?

427
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:32,080
Fine. An accident.

428
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,600
This must have been taken by our student.

429
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,160
He has been into Kou.

430
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,040
This must be his bitter revenge.

431
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,840
He knows you and my wife
are best friends from Weibo.

432
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,800
That's why he spammed you with comments.

433
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:44,680
He's so evil!

434
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,720
He wants to break my family apart!

435
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:49,840
So?

436
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:52,520
So, this picture is a misunderstanding?

437
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:54,680
You were kissing Kou.

438
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,680
Were you feeding her meds?

439
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,040
I can't comment on that.

440
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,400
Can you tell her after she gives birth?

441
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,120
She can't find out now!

442
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,520
I know it's my fault.

443
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,320
Can you give me another chance?

444
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:14,760
I'm begging you.

445
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,240
Do it for Xiaoyu's sake.

446
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:17,920
She's jobless.

447
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,520
How is she going to survive
as a single mom?

448
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:23,600
Breaking us apart will do her no good.

449
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:26,600
No good?

450
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:30,400
No good? I'll give you a good beating!

451
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:33,640
Do you do Yang Xiaoyu any good? Any good?

452
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,200
Fanxing!

453
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:38,120
If you hurt me,
how should I explain to Xiaoyu?

454
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:43,200
We'll go with you later!

455
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,640
Xiaoyu reads her Weibo every day.

456
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,640
You can't hide it anymore!

457
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:15,640
Professor Song is on holiday.

458
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,280
But what about you, Fanxing?

459
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,000
Why did you both come unannounced?

460
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,840
What happened to you?

461
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:25,960
Go get changed.

462
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:33,920
What's wrong?

463
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,400
Don't be crazy.

464
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,200
Go get changed.

465
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:41,000
You won't talk, right?

466
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:44,760
Let me help you.

467
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,040
Dear!

468
00:28:58,360 --> 00:28:59,400
Dear, I'm sorry.

469
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:09,520
Isn't that Ms. Kou from the dance studio?

470
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:11,040
Dear.

471
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,520
Dear, I'm truly sorry!

472
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,600
I won't contact her anymore.

473
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,040
Mind your health.

474
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,320
Let go of me.

475
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:20,520
I won't.

476
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:23,840
Let go!

477
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:34,000
Don't let our problem affect the kid.

478
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,560
Send Peanut to your mom's place
for two days.

479
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:40,240
We'll talk when you come back.

480
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,840
Dear, I know I was wrong.

481
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:44,880
Go now!

482
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:15,720
Have a seat.

483
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,040
Want a drink?

484
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,560
We don't want to drink. Don't bother.

485
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,520
We don't have much here.

486
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:26,560
There should be some drinks in the fridge.

487
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,000
Xiaoyu.

488
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,920
The person who got the photo

489
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:38,320
left many comments
in Professor Song's Weibo this morning.

490
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,120
You must have seen them.

491
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:44,360
We're worried you'd be furious.

492
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,240
So, we came over to see you.

493
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:51,960
I haven't read it.

494
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:53,840
But you gave me a like.

495
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:06,480
Will Coke do?

496
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:23,960
Why are you staring at me?

497
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:25,400
I'm fine.

498
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:29,240
Someone caught my husband cheating.

499
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:33,160
I watch every episode of <i>The Love Clinic.</i>

500
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,040
This...

501
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:37,440
is nothing new.

502
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,520
I'm not that naive...

503
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:43,360
to believe that my husband
would never cheat.

504
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:51,000
Love is wonderful.

505
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:52,720
It'd be even better...

506
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:56,000
if it never changes.

507
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:01,680
Xiaoyu.

508
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,840
What are you going to do?

509
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,480
If you file for a divorce,

510
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:10,920
the court won't approve it
based on your current situation.

511
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,600
Separation is best.

512
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:15,800
You'll have a newborn to breastfeed.

513
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,760
I'm fine as long as they break up.

514
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:22,760
Life is a long journey.

515
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,640
And people make mistakes.

516
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,680
I should give him a chance.

517
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:31,840
Right?

518
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,360
We all make mistakes.

519
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:40,720
But is cheating when your wife is pregnant
a forgivable mistake?

520
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,120
Does he even have a heart?

521
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:43,640
He doesn't.

522
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,000
He doesn't. All right?

523
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,680
He actually treats me very well.

524
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,960
He has been helping me with housework.

525
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,000
What do you mean by helping you?

526
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:55,840
Are you the only owner of the house?

527
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:58,040
He was making up for his guilt.

528
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,480
An adulterer gets his wife flowers.

529
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,920
Don't you watch all episodes
of <i>The Love Clinic</i>?

530
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:05,000
There's still hope
if he tries to make up for it.

531
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:07,520
Don't they go on your show to start over?

532
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:08,640
Yang Xiaoyu!

533
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:10,800
How could you still live with him?

534
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,160
What else can I do then?

535
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:13,360
Get a divorce?

536
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,400
If not?

537
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,320
This is her marriage.

538
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:22,960
Let her make the call.

539
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:29,160
But Xiaoyu,
you can't forgive him so easily.

540
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,160
Cheating is easy.

541
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:34,360
If men were given the chance,
they will cheat shamelessly.

542
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:36,000
Think carefully.

543
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:37,720
To get a divorce...

544
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:39,840
or to go on?

545
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,160
Divorce?

546
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,880
Why do you keep telling me
to get a divorce?

547
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:48,240
You're my best friend!

548
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,640
You don't comfort me.

549
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:52,120
Why are you pushing me to get a divorce?

550
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:54,320
We're pushing you?

551
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,720
Did you even put yourself in my shoes?

552
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,760
I'm about to give birth!

553
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,720
You're telling me this now.

554
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:11,960
Didn't you consider if the news
may cause me despair?

555
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:16,400
If we get a divorce while I'm jobless,

556
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,639
he'd get the custody of Peanut.

557
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:22,239
I'll be alone with the baby,

558
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,440
surviving on the alimony

559
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,199
that barely covers for baby formula.

560
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:29,480
Do I live off my parents?

561
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:33,040
This can be solved.

562
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:36,360
I'm different from you and Fanxing!

563
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:38,800
Are you married?

564
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,560
Are you unemployed like me?

565
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:43,760
Do you have kids?

566
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:47,360
You have well-paid jobs
and just enjoy dating.

567
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:50,280
You're judging me with your own standards!

568
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,080
Divorce sounds simple to you,

569
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,400
but not to me!

570
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:56,000
I don't need love anymore!

571
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:58,320
I just want to raise my kids. All right?

572
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,840
You can say whatever you want.

573
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:02,880
I don't care if you look down on me.

574
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,560
You're all just judging
from the sidelines!

575
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:19,000
Are you all right?

576
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,600
We should go.

577
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:22,080
Hey, Xiaoyu...

578
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:30,040
Xiaoyu.

579
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,560
I know you were just venting.

580
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:33,560
I'm not mad.

581
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:37,160
Call me if you need anything.

582
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:58,240
<i>When people get hurt,
they pull their spikes up.</i>

583
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,520
<i>But these spikes will hurt...</i>

584
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:03,880
<i>those who come to embrace you.</i>

585
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:55,240
Shen Fanfan is an animal!

586
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:57,120
About this.

587
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:00,080
You and Song Xue were too impulsive.

588
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,400
How could you tell Xiaoyu this now?

589
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,080
You should wait.

590
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:06,680
Their pictures were everywhere.

591
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:07,840
We couldn't hide it.

592
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,360
A leopard can't change its spots.

593
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,400
I should have punched him previously!

594
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:13,920
I did.

595
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:16,560
That's my sister.

596
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,720
Enough already.

597
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:20,080
You hit him?

598
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:24,640
When did we teach you
to solve problems with violence?

599
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:32,040
No matter how wrong he was,
it's not your place to hit him.

600
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:35,320
He is Xiaoyu's husband, not your husband!

601
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,720
If Xiaoyu hits him,
it'll also be against the law.

602
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:40,400
Ignorant children!

603
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:41,760
Right.

604
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:42,880
I forgot.

605
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,000
Mom is a volunteer law official here.

606
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:49,280
If I see him again,
I'll hit him if I get the chance!

607
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,320
I'll just pay his medical fees.

608
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:52,840
You're still so stubborn.

609
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:54,280
Listen to me.

610
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,760
You and Song Xue were at fault. Got it?

611
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:58,280
But we couldn't hide it!

612
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:00,200
Even if you couldn't hide it,

613
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:02,680
you should've waited
until Xiaoyu come to you!

614
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,600
Only after she has thought it through

615
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:09,200
will she be able to decide
whether to forgive him or get a divorce.

616
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:13,280
What you did was put her on the spot
and embarrass her.

617
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,680
Even though you're very close,

618
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,160
this is still their private life.

619
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,440
What do you know?

620
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:22,520
Are you the one to decide
if she could live with it?

621
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:25,400
How do you live with a husband like that?

622
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:26,600
Live until he dies?

623
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:29,440
Considering Xiaoyu's situation,

624
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:32,360
you can't just advise her
to get a divorce.

625
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:34,440
Their parents are still around.

626
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,800
Her kid has just gone to kindergarten.

627
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,600
The other is yet to be born.

628
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,760
Can you live on your pride?

629
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,320
Troublemaker.

630
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:44,600
Fine, I didn't get it.

631
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:45,640
I'm not eating.

632
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:53,720
Where are you going?

633
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:57,640
-Bye.
-Bye.

634
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:59,120
-Bye. See you tomorrow.
-Bye.

635
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,080
-Bye.
-Bye.

636
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:31,840
You lied that you went home.

637
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,960
If I hadn't seen you two...

638
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:36,000
Tell me! Until when do you plan
to hide it from us?

639
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,720
-It's my fault.
-What fault?

640
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:42,320
-I shouldn't have gone hiking.
-You!

641
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:43,760
I shouldn't have lied.

642
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:47,480
Cai Minmin, do you remember
the vow we made?

643
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:50,320
What will happen if we lied to each other?

644
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:53,320
We'll get piles.

645
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:54,760
Serves you right!

646
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:56,200
Even God can't stand you.

647
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:59,360
I bumped into you in less than three days.
Wait for your piles!

648
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:01,800
It's weird.

649
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,800
Why would Mr. He be attracted to you?

650
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,080
What's wrong with me?

651
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:09,920
Doesn't he always go for sophisticated
and independent women?

652
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:12,320
Am I not independent?

653
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:14,160
Missy, you're independent?

654
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:16,480
You can't even stand on one leg
for more than one minute.

655
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:19,480
Eating or putting on clothes
isn't independent.

656
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:21,240
It's called self-care.

657
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:28,080
We have an equal relationship.

658
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:30,040
We're not like a pet and its owner.

659
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:34,120
Besides, he's attracted to me
because I'm charming.

660
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:41,880
True enough. Men can't resist
the natural charm of 20-year-old girls.

661
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:47,440
You too?

662
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,120
I prefer them to be 21.

663
00:40:58,200 --> 00:40:59,400
Hello, Doggie.

664
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:02,080
You can't make it?

665
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:05,560
All right.

666
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:07,080
I'll figure it out.

667
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,600
Doggie has an interview.

668
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,960
-He can't cover me tomorrow.
-What?

669
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:15,440
What then?

670
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,720
I can't do a two-person job
alone tomorrow.

671
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:33,920
You're like a zombie couple
who have spotted prey.

672
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:35,560
Cai Minmin.

673
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,840
It's time to make amends.

674
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:48,400
Ouch.

675
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:53,320
<i>A busy work day begins.</i>

676
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:56,160
<i>I'm a happy Rainbow Doll today!</i>

677
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,800
