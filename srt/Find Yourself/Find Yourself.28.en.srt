1
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,240
Hey.

2
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,600
What is it?

3
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,320
If you have any clients,

4
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,240
keep them for me.

5
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,240
Aren't you tied up with other projects?

6
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,680
I have time at night,
so I can design them.

7
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,040
No more games?

8
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,400
I've had enough. I'm tired.

9
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:50,960
Okay.

10
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,480
Thank you.

11
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,560
What?

12
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,440
Are you two mobsters
exchanging information?

13
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,720
Shut up.

14
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,800
What's going on with you?

15
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:15,800
What?

16
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,840
You resigned, but you came back.

17
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,200
Last night,
Ms. He's boyfriend bought us dinner

18
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,280
and you insisted on going.

19
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,040
Someone was buying dinner.
Why wouldn't I go?

20
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,480
I'll be honest with you.

21
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,560
They seem to be doing well.

22
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,320
Don't ruin their relationship.

23
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,440
Well, you can be as generous as you want.

24
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,280
But do you have to make others
do the same?

25
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,200
What do you mean by that?

26
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,480
I meant it literally.

27
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,520
I'll see how long you can pretend.

28
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,000
Why do you keep saying weird things?

29
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,600
My baby is due next month.

30
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,800
I haven't been sleeping well lately.

31
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,640
Look at my leg.

32
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,160
Whenever I press it,
it leaves indentations.

33
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,000
At my last checkup,

34
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,960
I was told the baby is positioned wrongly.

35
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,640
I might need a C-section.

36
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:16,840
Since it's not under my control,
I should listen to the doctor.

37
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,040
Shen Fanfan only took half a day off
when you gave birth to Peanut.

38
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,960
Ask him to stay longer this time.

39
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,680
There's no need for that.

40
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:28,760
You, Song Xue, Canyang
and both our parents will be there.

41
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,440
That's already too many people.

42
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,240
It'll be so noisy.

43
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:35,320
Besides,
the ward can't fit so many people.

44
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:39,600
Are you giving birth to our kid
or Shen Fanfan's kid?

45
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:43,200
His pay will be deducted
if he's absent from work.

46
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,080
Adults don't have much freedom.

47
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,160
We all need to make a living.

48
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,000
You're such a good wife.

49
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,240
No, I'm not.

50
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,800
It's just because we're poor.

51
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,880
We have two kids now.

52
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,360
I'm a housewife.

53
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,000
If he has no income,

54
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:04,520
should our whole family
count on our parents

55
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,280
or starve on the streets?

56
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:16,840
I told her I'd take a half-month leave,
but she objected.

57
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,640
I've already submitted my leave request.

58
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,320
But I have no choice
since she objects to it.

59
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,360
Otherwise, I'd be staying with her
and nagging her daily.

60
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,120
All right. I know you're good to me.

61
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:28,120
Dad, I want to play on the slide.

62
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,560
Okay.

63
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:32,040
You guys eat up.
I'll take Peanut downstairs.

64
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:35,280
Leave everything here.
I'll clear the table when I get back.

65
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,040
Impressive, Shen Fanfan!

66
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:40,720
I never thought you'd become
a good family man.

67
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:45,160
My wife is pregnant.
I have to be a good husband.

68
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,600
Eat up. I'll take her downstairs.

69
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,000
-All right.
-Go ahead.

70
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:06,520
I was filming a show the other day
about a cheating husband.

71
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,920
He has two sons.

72
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,400
A three-year-old and a six-month-old.

73
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,840
That's not something new.

74
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,320
You're still focusing on those men?

75
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,440
It is indeed not something new.

76
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:21,400
But whenever a lady accuses
her husband is having an affair,

77
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,000
the ratings soar.

78
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:27,520
If you invite a health expert,
the ratings get even higher.

79
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,600
Honestly,

80
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,000
if your husband cheats on you,

81
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,480
would you ever forgive him?

82
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:42,640
I don't think so.

83
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,440
No way. I won't get over it.

84
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,680
It's like someone secretly

85
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:50,360
using your toothbrush
to scrub the toilet bowl.

86
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:53,360
Even after a long time,
I'll still feel gross.

87
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,960
Enough. Scrubbing the toilet bowl
with a toothbrush?

88
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:02,120
It's so gross that
my baby wants to come out.

89
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,800
You're a married woman.

90
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,040
Shen Fanfan is so playful.

91
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,520
What do you think?

92
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:17,440
Actually, I can accept an affair

93
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,960
if I don't know about it.

94
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:24,160
To me, not knowing means it doesn't exist.

95
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,480
Not knowing is one thing.

96
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,680
But it's escaping reality.

97
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,240
Let's forget about this affair talk
and talk about love.

98
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:37,800
You don't truly know
if your husband actually loves you.

99
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:41,240
Because it depends on what he tells you.

100
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:44,560
If he says he loves you,
but thinks about someone else,

101
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,720
that's not even love.

102
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:50,680
So, it is up to you to believe him or not.

103
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,520
But love is a matter between two people.

104
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,280
An affair involves three people.

105
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:00,480
You can't objectify love.

106
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,200
But when the third person
comes between the two,

107
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,560
they're an obstacle no matter what.

108
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,680
That's why I said
this is under the condition

109
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,720
that you found out about the third person.

110
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,200
It'll be tough when you do.

111
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,120
Which part would be tough?

112
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,760
The kids.

113
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,440
Look at me, I have two kids.

114
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:29,360
They are my priority
when I make decisions now.

115
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:32,000
It doesn't matter if the adults suffer.

116
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,400
But it'll be very tough for the kids.

117
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,360
They can't survive
without their parents' care.

118
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,040
You're right.

119
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:43,120
A loving and happy couple

120
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,320
is the best role model for children.

121
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,800
You're too naive.

122
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,400
Love no longer exists
after being married for over ten years.

123
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,840
Just live well.

124
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,280
If he had an affair,

125
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:57,040
it doesn't exist if I don't know about it.

126
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,760
Why be so hard on yourself?

127
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,480
Isn't it better to live a simple life?

128
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,720
We have to move on anyway.

129
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,600
I guess.

130
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,520
You're married, you have the say in this.

131
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,920
Peanut is back already?

132
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,760
Dongyang, you're so early.

133
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,560
-I came right after work.
-Come in.

134
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,120
You're all here.
I hope you're not waiting for me.

135
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,600
Dongyang, how long have you
not paid your respect to me?

136
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:37,560
Greetings to Your Highness.

137
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,680
I bought these presents for Your Highness.

138
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,120
That's a lot.

139
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,160
I haven't even finished the formula
you got us last time.

140
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:51,800
Look, these are all for your baby.

141
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,640
It is due soon, right?

142
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,880
Yes.

143
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,640
Honey.

144
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:00,360
There's so much food!
I'll finish everything up.

145
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:03,240
I can't stand you. This is for you.

146
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,360
You even took my seat. Hand that to me.

147
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,040
He Fanxing,

148
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,800
you've really changed my opinion of you.

149
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,760
I heard you dated two guys
in three months.

150
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,600
Don't listen to Song Xue.

151
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,640
Tell me if it's true.

152
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,120
It is.

153
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,440
Incredible!

154
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,720
-What's wrong?
-What's going on?

155
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,760
I'm fine.

156
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,560
I'm going to the toilet.

157
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,840
-I'll go with you.
-There's no need. You eat up.

158
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:38,960
Be careful.

159
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,840
Eat up.

160
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,560
Well,

161
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,720
it's a good thing
we insist on not having kids.

162
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,240
Why not?
You two are so loving. Just do it.

163
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:02,240
Forget it.
Raising a kid is so troublesome.

164
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,040
I don't want Song Xue to suffer. Right?

165
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,680
That depends.

166
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,400
Look at Xiaoyu.

167
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:15,680
She looks so happy with the kids.

168
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,240
Shen Fanfan is also very caring.

169
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:23,600
You're right.
Her Highness is going to have a good life.

170
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,280
Your style has changed.

171
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,720
You're more stable now.

172
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:14,440
My girlfriend specially trained me.

173
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,400
She's a great player.

174
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,600
She's not only good at pool,
she's also great at badminton.

175
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,200
-And--
-All right.

176
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,400
You've been showing off all night.

177
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,360
Enough. Cut it out.

178
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,600
Haven't you been boasting

179
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:33,120
about how awesome
and capable your wife is?

180
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,320
So you're not fighting anymore?

181
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,080
Which couple doesn't fight?

182
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,120
Right, I have something important
to tell you.

183
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,200
Tomorrow is my daughter's birthday.

184
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:46,320
Bring your girlfriend.
I'll introduce her to my wife.

185
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,680
You're only telling me
such important news now?

186
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,080
I'm not sure if my fairy can come
to the mortal world.

187
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,520
She's an employee of mine after all.

188
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,760
I can call her manager and arrange things.

189
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,240
No need.

190
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,240
Who doesn't know you're the boss?

191
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,240
I'll handle it.

192
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:07,240
I want to find out how you won her over.

193
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,120
You weren't together
when we met at the hotel.

194
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,120
We were close.

195
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,720
The point is,
her ex is much younger than her.

196
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:18,640
Young people get agitated so easily.

197
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:23,440
Even if he can keep his cool,
he can't beat your servile manner.

198
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:26,520
You're truly my buddy.
You're always so kind.

199
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,640
By the way, we had a bet.

200
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,560
If I could get her within two months,

201
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,520
you’d add 20 percent to the ad budget
for the next quarter.

202
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,200
When will you draw up the contract?

203
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,720
When was that? Why don't I remember?

204
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,640
Don't pretend.

205
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,360
I have a recording of that.

206
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,960
All right. I remember it now.

207
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,760
Did you really need to record
a friendly wager?

208
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,400
That's why I didn't.

209
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,520
When will I receive the new contract?

210
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:00,000
Hey, we agreed on a two-month time limit.

211
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,400
But you took longer than that to get her.

212
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,480
It really was around two months.

213
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:09,160
All right, I'll give you a discount.
15 percent.

214
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,240
Five percent.

215
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,840
This is too much. A boss like you
shouldn't bargain that much.

216
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:16,800
I'll meet you halfway.

217
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,920
-Twelve percent.
-Ten percent.

218
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,520
Deal!

219
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,320
But something feels wrong about this.

220
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,880
A bet is a bet.

221
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,960
I remember our bet
was originally just ten percent.

222
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,680
Really?

223
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:41,280
I remember it was 20 percent.

224
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,360
Now I'm sure it was ten percent!

225
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,160
You!

226
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,080
Do you have a cold?
You look under the weather.

227
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,200
Are you in a bad mood
because of Shen Fanfan?

228
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,400
I was so scared that
you'd tell everyone about his affair.

229
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:13,720
Song Xue, I think we should let it go.

230
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,360
They're husband and wife.

231
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,880
We're close to Xiaoyu,
but we're just friends.

232
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,320
We're still outsiders.

233
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,000
You want me to act like I don't know?

234
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:28,480
What if Xiaoyu actually knows about it?

235
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,760
Impossible.

236
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,080
She'd have told me and Fanxing right away.

237
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:36,960
Fine. I know the chances are slim,
but it's not impossible.

238
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,320
If Xiaoyu doesn't want a divorce,
then it's a possibility.

239
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,200
People have their pride.

240
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,000
She doesn't want a divorce

241
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:46,520
as long as her husband
makes a clean break.

242
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:49,720
But if you expose it,
she'll be in a dilemma.

243
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:52,480
She doesn't have the courage
to divorce him.

244
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,120
But it's shameful if she doesn't.

245
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,920
It's very hard to separate
when children are involved.

246
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,520
Blood is thicker than water.

247
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,560
They're connected by blood.

248
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,080
It is a deep entanglement of life.

249
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,680
It's a horrible thing.

250
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,280
Hurry up. She has school tomorrow.

251
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,360
Got it.

252
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,280
Peanut, what sound does a duck make?

253
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,080
Quack.

254
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,280
What about a goat?

255
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,360
Bleat.

256
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:37,680
<i>I was filming a show the other day
about a cheating husband.</i>

257
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:38,920
<i>He has two sons.</i>

258
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,280
<i>A three-year-old and a six-month-old.</i>

259
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,440
<i>You're a married woman.</i>

260
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,920
<i>Shen Fanfan is so playful.</i>

261
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,440
<i>What do you think?</i>

262
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,640
MS. KOU

263
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:49,240
Let's go. Our clean little kitty
is going to bed.

264
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,920
-Let's find Mom.
-Mom!

265
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,520
Mom is sleeping.

266
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,400
Come in.

267
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:18,800
You were looking for me, Mr. Li?

268
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:22,080
Fanxing, I'm giving you a chance

269
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,560
to meet your boyfriend
during working hours.

270
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,920
Send this supplemental agreement
to Minglu.

271
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,200
Ask Mr. Ye to sign this.

272
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,400
A supplemental agreement?

273
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:34,360
Didn't we sign a contract with Minglu
a few months ago?

274
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:38,680
We've been acquired by Aijia.
It's all cut and dried now.

275
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,640
We're now a subsidiary of Aijia.

276
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,520
There were some problems
with the old agreement.

277
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:46,840
So we've made amendments
based on the headquarters' order.

278
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,840
Don't delay. Go now.

279
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,880
I have work to do. Can I ask Bai to do it?

280
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,560
I'll tell Mr. Ye.

281
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,320
No, you must go.
I won't be at ease if it's someone else.

282
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,600
All right.

283
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,240
Wait.

284
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,400
Fanxing.

285
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:05,040
I heard Mr. Ye courted you
for a long time.

286
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,520
Does he like you very much?

287
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,440
We're still

288
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:19,680
at the stage
of getting to know each other.

289
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:22,200
I see. As long as you're doing good.

290
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,080
Okay, go now. It's fine.

291
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,600
Bai.

292
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,840
I have to go to Minglu
to have a document signed.

293
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,600
When the delivery arrives,
open it and check the contents.

294
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,560
The forms are on my desk.
Verify everything.

295
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,880
Sure, no problem.

296
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,800
You're really in love.

297
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,800
I can't believe a boss
is doing trivial work.

298
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:55,200
I remember not too long ago,
someone didn't want to go there

299
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,480
and deceived me into doing the legwork.

300
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,280
Sorry.

301
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:01,720
Ms. He.

302
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,120
I have to check some furnishings
with a client.

303
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,960
Can I share a ride with you?

304
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,720
Sure.

305
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:26,880
Did you change your perfume?

306
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,360
What?

307
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,400
Yes.

308
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:33,720
I read online

309
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,760
that a woman cuts her hair
when she has a breakup,

310
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,400
and changes her perfume
when she has a new lover.

311
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,240
I'm kidding. Don't be mad.

312
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:48,600
We're friends now,
but I still can't help but speak my mind.

313
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:51,840
Be honest with me.

314
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,080
Why did you come back?

315
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,720
When Mr. Li asked me to get you
to reconsider, you refused.

316
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:00,400
Then you applied for a job at Aijia
and was transferred back.

317
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:01,480
Why?

318
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,080
What do you think the reason is?

319
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,720
Don't answer my questions with questions.

320
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,240
All right. I'll stop teasing you.

321
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,400
I had to come back.

322
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:17,080
Meiyin insisted that I work at Aijia.

323
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:20,840
I didn't want to work at the headquarters,
so I came back.

324
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,000
Wu Meiyin?

325
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,720
I can't go against her.

326
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,400
You and her...

327
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,560
Forget it.

328
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,280
Didn't you hand over all your clients?

329
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:43,520
You're viewing furnishings
with a new client already?

330
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,040
I handed over everyone but this.

331
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:48,600
I have to follow through
with Cai Minmin's project.

332
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,240
She's my junior after all.

333
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,560
Cai Minmin?

334
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:56,760
She just liked your post.

335
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:59,160
Fate works in funny ways.

336
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,400
Right.

337
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,040
Then, will you...

338
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:10,080
accept her in the future?

339
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,360
Do you know what this agreement means?

340
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,440
It means,

341
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:49,640
after Aijia has completed
the acquisition of Amazing Decoration,

342
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:52,480
the original agreement will be invalid.

343
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:56,720
For branding,
Aijia will liaise with Minglu directly.

344
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:03,440
Amazing Decoration doesn't have
an independent department for that.

345
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,960
Aijia will take charge of it.

346
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:08,920
It is cost-saving and efficient.

347
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,720
That's not a bad thing.

348
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:13,600
You'll save money, but I'll earn less.

349
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:18,280
Your boss accepts anything but a raw deal.

350
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:22,200
SONG YIFAN

351
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,440
<i>Hello, Luming?</i>

352
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,720
Mr. Song.

353
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:30,400
Goodness, why are you so polite today?

354
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,400
<i>It's business.</i>

355
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,600
<i>I've got to be polite to Party A.</i>

356
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,520
I just received an agreement from Aijia.
Do you know about it?

357
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,000
<i>What agreement?</i>

358
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:40,920
Simply put,

359
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,600
I finally got a ten percent raise
for the advertising budget.

360
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:46,040
But I have to return it
after I sign this agreement.

361
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:49,360
You know I don’t deal with small matters.

362
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,000
My wife is in charge of these things.

363
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,840
<i>Why don’t you call her?</i>

364
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:58,320
Forget it.
I didn't know her when you married her.

365
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:01,040
Just take the money as a wedding gift.

366
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
All right, I have to go.
I have an agreement to sign.

367
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,120
<i>Okay.</i>

368
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,680
Now you know
why Mr. Li asked you to deliver this.

369
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:25,040
Why don't you fight for it?

370
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,320
Why don't...

371
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,080
you fight for it?

372
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:33,600
I’m in no position to do that.

373
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,840
Besides, Mr. Li has limited options
regarding this.

374
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,720
Of course not with Mr. Li.

375
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:42,160
You have a chance
to talk to your big boss tonight.

376
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,400
What do you think?

377
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,120
What?

378
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,440
It's his daughter's birthday party
tonight.

379
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,840
He keeps saying that
he wants to meet my girlfriend.

380
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,440
I've even prepared a dress for you.

381
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,640
Isn't this the dress I gave you?

382
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,840
I've always wanted to give it back to you.

383
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,600
You look great in it.

384
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:08,160
Besides, you have no reason
to reject my gifts now.

385
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:12,360
I bought this with my own money, okay?

386
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:13,880
Gift?

387
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:17,800
Let’s go. I’ll buy you lunch.
I’ll pick you up after work.

388
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:29,480
You buying me lunch makes me uneasy.

389
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,040
Why is that?

390
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,960
Don't worry.

391
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:38,200
I don't like you anymore.
This isn't some kind of tactic.

392
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,760
I’m not like my uncle, that old loach.

393
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,920
He's devious and cunning.

394
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,440
But he really was successful this time.

395
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,920
He must be so happy.

396
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:50,360
Yes, he is. Too happy, in fact.

397
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,200
He's putting his girlfriend
before his niece now.

398
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:55,960
I asked him out to dinner last time,
and guess what happened?

399
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,920
He sent me a red packet
with 88 yuan in it.

400
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,560
He brushed me off with just 88 yuan!

401
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,960
He must watch out.

402
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:07,160
Since he stole someone's girl,

403
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:10,080
he might lose her the way he got her.

404
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,640
Stole? Didn't he snatch her away?

405
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,520
That's if he competed fairly.

406
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,800
But he bonded with her as a friend
and swooped in on her.

407
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,480
That's stealing.

408
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,520
It sounds nasty but true. You’re right.

409
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:29,200
Enough about my disgraceful uncle.
I have something to ask you.

410
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:31,800
We have similar situations,
but you're more experienced.

411
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:32,920
Go on.

412
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,960
I'm dating a guy who is more than
ten years older than me.

413
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:39,400
More than ten years?

414
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:43,160
After having crushes on guys of my age,

415
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:46,240
I realized a mature guy
is more suitable for me.

416
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,360
I wish you happiness.

417
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:52,280
Aren't you surprised?
He's more than ten years older.

418
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:55,000
Aren't you curious about him?

419
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,840
I'm quite surprised,
but I'm not that curious about it.

420
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:01,040
Shouldn't you talk to
your female friends about this instead?

421
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:05,200
You have indeed been around the block.

422
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,880
You're so calm.

423
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,520
I wanted to tell Zhanni,

424
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,280
but I can't.

425
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,840
Because we're keeping our relationship
in a greenhouse.

426
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,680
A greenhouse?

427
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,840
A sprout will die from frost in winter.

428
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,920
It should be kept in a greenhouse.

429
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,600
When it's strong enough
to brave extreme weathers,

430
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:25,960
we'll take it out.

431
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:28,600
Our relationship is based on this theory.

432
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,600
We'll hide it at first like you did.

433
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,080
Hide it?

434
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,240
Even from your closest friends?

435
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,400
It's a secret?

436
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:41,960
It's also quite exciting
to keep it a secret.

437
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,480
Are you being tricked by him?

438
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:45,400
Didn't you do the same as well?

439
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,880
She did trick me!

440
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,400
For your money?

441
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,600
No.

442
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:54,520
Anyway, a secret relationship is taboo.
It's unacceptable.

443
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:00,080
But I think this is quite good.

444
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,480
Is this your first love?

445
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,920
If you don't count my previous crushes,

446
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,920
then this is actually my first love.

447
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:13,840
If you hide it until you break up,
then congratulations.

448
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,840
Your friends and relatives will think that
your next boyfriend is your first love.

449
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:19,480
No one will acknowledge
your real first love.

450
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:27,640
Isn't that very exciting?

451
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:01,400
I don't know how to educate my son now.

452
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:02,560
He's only 12.

453
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,840
He has good grades and seems well-behaved.

454
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,720
He also never breaks any rules.

455
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:08,840
But it turns out

456
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:12,240
that he has been criticizing everything
and his teachers online.

457
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:16,520
-Like having a split personality.
-Kids.

458
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,560
They can't be too obedient.

459
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,320
My daughter is 16 this year.

460
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:24,120
She's like a monkey.
Always jumping up and down all day.

461
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,520
She said after she graduates high school,

462
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:29,520
she wants to learn how to fly a plane
at the air force academy.

463
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:35,200
We haven't met Mr. Song's son.
I heard he's outstanding.

464
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,160
He's remarkable.

465
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:40,520
So remarkable that I seldom see him.

466
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:44,920
I'd rather have a daughter than a son.

467
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,240
Yes.

468
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,360
Here you go.

469
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:50,160
We only stay here on the weekends.

470
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,560
We grow some fruit trees in the yard.

471
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,160
My daughter and I picked
the hawthorn berries and made this wine.

472
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,520
It's nice.

473
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,080
Meiyin, you're amazing.
You can make anything.

474
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,960
You're totally a superwoman.

475
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:04,080
Both your career and family
are well taken care of.

476
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,480
Superwomen are rare to find.

477
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:10,880
My family hoped that I would have a kid
right after we got married.

478
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,640
I spent over ten years building a career.

479
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:15,440
But to them,
having a child is more important.

480
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,520
We all have different values.
We can't force them.

481
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,720
When Tangtang was little,

482
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,840
I was so busy with work every day.

483
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:25,040
Sometimes, when I got home,
I'd cry so much.

484
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,800
Really? Why?

485
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,280
I had never taken care of a baby before.
I was exhausted.

486
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:32,720
Your dad's last name is Song,
but yours is Wu.

487
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,160
Were you adopted?

488
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,680
No, I took my mom's last name.

489
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,640
My mom asked me to.

490
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:41,080
We all listen to everything she says.

491
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,680
She's the boss.

492
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:45,000
We listen to my dad in my family.

493
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:46,480
He's the one making money.

494
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:49,440
My grandma said
the one making money is the boss.

495
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:51,120
Your grandma is wrong.

496
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:54,480
So what if someone makes money?
My dad also makes a lot of money.

497
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,200
You guys are lame.

498
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:59,600
Let me take you to my brother.
He knows what's fun.

499
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:00,960
He's a know-it-all.

500
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:01,920
Really?

501
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,240
You'll find out. Follow me.

502
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:27,720
What's wrong?

503
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:35,280
Don't you find it a bit weird?

504
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,200
How so?

505
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:44,120
You're introducing me to your friends now.

506
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:46,960
So?

507
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,680
Wait. Let's make it clear.

508
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,880
Our current status is that

509
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:55,840
we just decided

510
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:58,680
to try to build our relationship.

511
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,520
It's only been a few days.

512
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,280
But we've already met

513
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:05,320
my family, your sister,

514
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,440
my colleagues, and your niece.

515
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:09,120
Now I'm meeting your friends.

516
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:10,800
I think

517
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,560
the pace is a little weird.

518
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,040
How so?

519
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:23,280
I don't think I should be here.

520
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,600
Just go home then.

521
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:43,360
Since I'm already here,
where else can I go?

522
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:47,400
I was just grumbling a bit.

523
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,160
Don't misunderstand.

524
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:51,600
Please tell me
if I've done something wrong.

525
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:58,000
If you shouldn't be here,
where should you be?

526
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:01,280
We are developing our relationship,
but you are my girlfriend.

527
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:04,680
It's my friend's daughter's party.
Shouldn't you come?

528
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:07,040
I should.

529
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:13,920
I didn't know you'd get angry so easily.

530
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,920
It's bad for your skin.

531
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:19,480
Do you know where you were wrong?

532
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,000
I do.

533
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,520
Where?

534
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:24,360
I was wrong because you said so.

535
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:25,960
I won't do it again.

536
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:29,240
If you say that,
then you don't really know.

537
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:33,080
What do you even mean by that?
You're wrong because I said you were?

538
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:36,320
It is your fault
for making me sound unreasonable.

539
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:37,800
No.

540
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:40,400
You're angry. So it must be my fault.

541
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,160
Tell me then.
What part of it is your fault?

542
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:46,440
Excuse me, did you forget your invitation?

543
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:47,600
What?

544
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:50,360
Sir, your car isn't parked yet.

545
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:51,800
Could you park just in front?

546
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,240
Is this okay?

547
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:03,320
Sir, please park in the parking lot.

548
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,480
Didn't you say just in front?

549
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,680
-Is this okay?
-Why not back up a little?

550
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:10,960
Is this okay?

551
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,360
WELCOME TO MY BIRTHDAY PARTY

552
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:24,880
Do all rich kids
celebrate their birthdays like this?

553
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,720
When I was little,

554
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:31,880
my sister would make me some noodles
and two fried eggs.

555
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:35,440
It shouldn't be fried eggs,
it should be hard-boiled eggs,

556
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,360
skewered with a chopstick.

557
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,760
Why? What's the reason behind that?

558
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:43,040
A chopstick and two eggs
symbolize 100 percent.

559
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,000
Superstitious.

560
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:47,240
Are you not angry anymore?

561
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:52,000
If I was really mad at you,
I would have gone nuts.

562
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:54,720
Watch your step.

563
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:58,920
Mr. Ye!

564
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,200
-Mr. Feng.
-Hello.

565
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:01,760
It's been a while.

566
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,320
I heard you got a promotion.

567
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,680
What promotion?

568
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:06,520
-It was a normal transfer.
-I see.

569
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:07,800
Congratulations.

570
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,480
I'll say hi to Steven.

571
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:10,760
-Sure.
-All right.

572
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:12,040
Talk to you later.

573
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:15,560
Steven.

574
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,480
There you are.

575
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,080
Excuse me.

576
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:23,560
Both of you have met before,
but allow me to officially introduce you.

577
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:27,320
My girlfriend, He Fanxing.
Executive Director at Amazing Decoration.

578
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:29,200
Hello, Mr. Song.

579
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,120
-Nice to meet you.
-Just call me He.

580
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:36,800
You're Luming's girlfriend
and an employee of Aijia.

581
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:39,240
No matter what, you're family now.

582
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:42,920
Right.

583
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,400
Even though we're family,

584
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,880
cough it up when you should.

585
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:52,360
By the way, He,

586
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:56,560
Luming said that
you're worried about your company.

587
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:01,240
Well, Aijia has acquired
Amazing Decoration.

588
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:03,520
You're not only looking at our brand,

589
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:06,000
but also the staff who built the brand.

590
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:10,400
But until now, Aijia still hasn't
given clear instructions

591
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,560
on whether we'll operate independently

592
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:15,600
or merge with the headquarters
for unified management.

593
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:16,840
So,

594
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:20,160
many in our company feel insecure.

595
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:22,840
There's a high turnover
in all departments.

596
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:24,800
Because of Aijia's rigid policies,

597
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:27,840
even some old employees
have also resigned.

598
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:33,400
So I think employees should be
more important than the policy.

599
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,680
You're right, employees are important.

600
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:44,640
But He, have you heard of
the Pareto Principle?

601
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,240
It states that in most companies,

602
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:52,040
20 percent of the staff
creates 80 percent of the business.

603
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:55,640
Those who only think about themselves,

604
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:58,160
have no confidence or fool around,

605
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,560
will be eliminated.

606
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:02,040
True.

607
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:05,480
Different company cultures
is also our concern.

608
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:09,720
But new blood needs time

609
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:11,480
to adjust and blend in.

610
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,320
What you said isn't wrong.

611
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:18,400
Amazing Decoration still wishes
to remain as a warm family.

612
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,080
That is understandable.

613
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:23,440
But they have to respect Aijia's culture,

614
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:26,280
follow the rules
and earn respect with your own abilities.

615
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:29,800
Of course, Aijia is also willing
to grow with the staff,

616
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,320
provided that

617
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,440
they want to grow instead of backing away.

618
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:40,240
I see.

619
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,840
It's the survival of the fittest.

620
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:45,600
Even if we keep those who are unfit,

621
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:46,840
when we dismiss them,

622
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:49,160
we still have to pay them
severance pay, don't we?

623
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,120
What's this?

624
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:56,840
Is today a good day to discuss work?

625
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:03,200
He, just add me on WeChat.

626
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,240
Sure.

627
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:06,800
I hope you don't mind.

628
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:10,080
About what?
You're the boss. You're always right.

629
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,240
-Mr. Ye.
-Mr. Sun.

630
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,280
How are you?

631
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:40,080
May I know where the washroom is?

632
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,720
Go straight and turn left.

633
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:42,880
Thank you.

634
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:12,000
<i>-Why is he here?
-Why is she here?</i>

635
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,440
Yuan Song, your clothes.

636
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,720
<i>Why is she here?</i>

637
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:47,320
He Fanxing, we've met before.

638
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:50,160
Did Yuan Song invite you?

639
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:52,240
-Have a good chat.
-No.

640
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:54,800
I came with someone else.

641
00:39:58,520 --> 00:39:59,600
I see.

642
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:02,600
Yuan Song told me that
you often take care of him.

643
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:04,360
Thank you.

644
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:06,440
It's nothing.

645
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:13,160
Are you Yuan Song's sister?

646
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:14,520
Sister?

647
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:18,720
Yuan Song, what did you tell her?

648
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:21,360
I told her that you're a family member.

649
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:27,640
How could she understand
if you put it that way?

650
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:31,600
Fanxing!

651
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:34,400
I've been looking for you.

652
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:36,480
You're...

653
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,040
<i>Why is he here?</i>

654
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:41,440
<i>Why is he here?</i>

655
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:44,160
Meiyin.

656
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:54,440
I came with Mr. Ye.

657
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:58,840
Luming, Ms. He...

658
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:01,760
Let me introduce you.

659
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,360
This is my girlfriend, He Fanxing.

She'll be Aijia's employee soon.

661
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,200
Please take care of her.

662
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,240
The boy is also here.

663
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:18,600
Is this boy your friend?

664
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:23,040
-He is--
-You're all here.

665
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:25,600
Tangtang is about to cut the cake.
Come on.

666
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:26,800
Dad.

667
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,280
He just called him...

668
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:31,200
<i>-Are you kidding me?
-Are you kidding me?</i>

669
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:34,000
You haven't made the introductions?

670
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:38,960

672
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:45,840

673
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,640
-I know.
-You know?

674
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:49,840

676
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:58,120
