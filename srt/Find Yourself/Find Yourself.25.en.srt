1
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,160
My apologies.

2
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,560
I'm sorry.

3
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,880
What are you sorry for?

4
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,680
Actually, I just need
to be a good listener.

5
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,160
Since I'm courting you,
whatever you say is right.

6
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,760
I think

7
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:30,360
you'd better not pin your hopes on me.

8
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:34,400
Even now, I still like my ex-boyfriend.

9
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,880
Do you wish to get back together?

10
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,280
No.

11
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,800
It's just that we already broke up.

12
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,360
But he still refuses to study abroad.

13
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,360
I just don't know what's on his mind.

14
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,000
What you can never get is always the best.

15
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:03,000
If you won't get back with him,
don't give him false hope.

16
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,320
Should I persuade him
to go abroad instead?

17
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,240
Who am I to him?

18
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,200
Why should he listen to me?

19
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,000
What rights do I have

20
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,080
to interfere with his decision?

21
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,920
Exactly.

22
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,480
Since you have no rights,

23
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,320
whether he's going abroad or not
has nothing to do with you.

24
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,520
Indeed.

25
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,360
But...

26
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,560
But...

27
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:39,080
But because you like him,
you're still worried about him.

28
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,160
Truth is, you know
what you're supposed to do, right?

29
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,400
I get it.

30
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,520
Hey.

31
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,640
I have a great suggestion.

32
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,200
Just give us a chance.

33
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,160
Don't reject me first.

34
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,680
My offer is good for everyone.

35
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Think about it.

36
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:08,440
You can try dating me to make him give up.

37
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:11,080
Maybe he will be able
to go on his way by then.

38
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,280
Don't be too stressed out.

39
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,360
You don't have to reciprocate
just because I like you.

40
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:17,960
But...

41
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,080
Don't seal up all the doors.

42
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,840
We do get along.

43
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,160
Your parents are fond of me.

44
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,520
We also understand each other.

45
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,280
That's not a good idea.

46
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,240
Developing a relationship

47
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,320
feels too deliberate.

48
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:44,920
Would you rather go on a blind date
and fall in love at first sight?

49
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:49,800
Going on a blind date is nothing more
than testing out the chemistry.

50
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:52,920
If they suit each other,
they can try to develop a relationship.

51
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,560
If you can try dating a stranger,

52
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,520
why can't you date a friend?

53
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,520
There shouldn't be double standards.

54
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,040
It's okay.

55
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,080
Don't be stressed out.

56
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:11,720
Take your time.

57
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,600
Children grow up so fast.

58
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,400
They outgrow their clothes so quickly.

59
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,120
It's better to wear patchwork clothes.

60
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,120
When Jiacheng was little,
he even wore Canyang's old clothes.

61
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,880
When the Xi family gave me
some baby clothes,

62
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,360
my daughter-in-law was infuriated.

63
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,560
It wasn't like we couldn't afford them,
so she threw them away.

64
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,360
What a waste.

65
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,760
You could've given them away.

66
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:55,960
That's right.

67
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:59,000
It's obvious that
she has never starved before.

68
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,760
Decades ago, the whole family
used to share a pair of pants.

69
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,360
Whoever goes out would wear it.

70
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,200
Mom, I'm home.

71
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,720
-You're home.
-Yes.

72
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,640
He Fanxing, you're back.

73
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,040
-Mrs. Wang, you're here too.
-Yes.

74
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,800
Yes, come here.

75
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,720
I've been waiting for you.

76
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,320
-Why were you waiting for me?
-Listen.

77
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,920
I have good news.

78
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,320
I was just telling your mom this morning.

79
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,600
I have collected some profiles
of eligible bachelors.

80
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,000
See if you like any of them.

81
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,920
Hey, what are you waiting for?

82
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Look.

83
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,520
Take a look!

84
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,400
Come on.

85
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:43,080
I got these from
the matchmaking association.

86
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,520
You're the first one
who gets to see these candidates.

87
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,520
After you have chosen,
the others will get your leftovers.

88
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,040
Look here.

89
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,520
Most girls like guys like him.

90
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,400
He can dance,
just like those Korean celebrities.

91
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,520
Tian Qi, 29 years old.

92
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,720
He is a lawyer.

93
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,280
His annual salary is 300,000 yuan.

94
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,080
He is good as he earns a lot.

95
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,640
Mrs. Wang, he's not my type.

96
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,160
That's fine. I have other options here.

97
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,000
Hey, look at this one.

98
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,880
This one, Zhao Yujian.

99
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,320
He is 34 years old. He studied in the US.

100
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,880
Also, he runs his own company.

101
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,760
Look, he's fair and handsome.

102
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,040
It's just that he has divorced twice.

103
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,560
But he has no children.

104
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,680
I have better ones here.

105
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,640
This one is good. Fanxing, look at this.

106
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,920
This guy is 180cm tall.

107
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:34,280
But he has some pimples on his face.

108
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,720
It's fine as it can be treated.

109
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,800
Mrs. Wang,
you don't have to trouble yourself.

110
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,080
I don't need these.

111
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,360
Fanxing, don't be so insensible.

112
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,240
You're already 32 years old.
You're no longer young.

113
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,080
You have fallen behind.

114
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,000
You can only pick among the leftovers now.

115
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,520
Just pick one while you still can.

116
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,680
It's okay, Xiulian.

117
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,880
It's nice of you
to fix her up with someone.

118
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,760
But you shouldn't insult her.

119
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,560
Kids these days need some insults.

120
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,480
Mrs. Wang.

121
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,000
I already have a good match.

122
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,040
What?

123
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:09,800
Do you?

124
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,760
But your mom, she--

125
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,400
My parents don't know yet.

126
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,680
I haven't told them.

127
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,320
It's the guy you met before.

128
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,400
My best friend.

129
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,800
That one.

130
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,960
The decent man who owns a company, Mr. Ye.

131
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:25,840
When...

132
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,800
When did this happen?

133
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:31,320
These past few days.

134
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:35,120
I figured that
he's quite compatible with me.

135
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,000
I decided to give it a try.

136
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,840
When are you getting married?

137
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:43,280
Mrs. Wang, nothing has been settled yet.

138
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,000
It's only a matter of time.

139
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,960
You'll be getting married soon.

140
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,640
Congratulations.

141
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,600
You have a son-in-law now.

142
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,680
Judging by this,

143
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:58,000
you'll become grandparents
around this time next year.

144
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,960
Is it true?

145
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,120
What an odd coincidence.

146
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,920
She must be deceiving Mrs. Wang.

147
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,240
We shouldn't have invited Mrs. Wang.

148
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,120
Nothing she said was pleasant to the ears.

149
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,280
It was your idea.

150
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,240
I never agreed to this.

151
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,200
Yes.

152
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:35,920
It's all on me.

153
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,240
It's all on me.

154
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,720
-It's okay.
-Not bad.

155
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:50,080
-It's comfortable.
-It looks nice.

156
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,400
-In the future...
-He's here again.

157
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,720
Why are you here so early?

158
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:05,080
I'm here to give them the walking shoes.

159
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,800
Thank you. Then have more of this.

160
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,480
You too. Here.

161
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,680
Look at how nice Luming is.

162
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:24,680
That's right.

163
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:29,600
The guy Mrs. Wang recommended
to Fanxing yesterday

164
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,960
was divorced and has a child.

165
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,280
He's only 160cm tall.

166
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,000
Like a little girl.

167
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,600
Was Mrs. Wang the one I met before?

168
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,040
Yes.

169
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:45,520
After Fanxing turned anxious
and said that you two were together,

170
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,000
she just left.

171
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,960
I'm quite useful for any emergencies.

172
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,280
I thought so too.

173
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,320
Who said it was for an emergency?

174
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,640
If it wasn't,

175
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,840
then why did you lie?

176
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:08,480
Are you blaming me
because I let Mrs. Wang in?

177
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,200
Do you resent me?

178
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,360
Are you taking revenge on me?

179
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:15,280
Mom, of course not. What are you thinking?

180
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,640
I said it because
I really want to give it a try.

181
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,360
Really?

182
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,080
Yes.

183
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,000
So am I the last one to know?

184
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,560
I haven't gotten the chance to tell you.

185
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,680
I was in a rush.

186
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,480
Here.

187
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,640
Here, have a bun.

188
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,160
Thank you.

189
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,400
I thought about it.

190
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:25,280
Your suggestion is quite good.

191
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,520
It's time for me to move on.

192
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,720
So you weren't using me.

193
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,320
No.

194
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,040
Does this mean that
you are now my girlfriend?

195
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,120
Let's clear things up.

196
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:56,760
What?

197
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:00,040
Although we are giving it a try,
it is still a serious relationship.

198
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,640
You are my girlfriend.

199
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,080
This isn't a secret.

200
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,920
We are doing it for real.

201
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,240
Okay, I agree.

202
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,160
I'll have what a boyfriend is entitled to.

203
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,400
Like what?

204
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,280
To drive you to and from work,

205
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:30,680
eat together,

206
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:31,880
and date on weekends.

207
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,280
I want all of them.

208
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,840
Why does it feel like

209
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:41,000
I have signed an unequal treaty?

210
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,000
Unequal treaty?

211
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,800
I'm the one suffering a loss here.

212
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,440
Fine.

213
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,760
I accept all of them.

214
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,240
Anything else?

215
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:55,840
Congratulations.

216
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,880
You now have a chance
to walk into my life.

217
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,320
It's a jackpot.

218
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,400
Thank you for that.

219
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,400
You're welcome.

220
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,360
Thank you as well.

221
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,720
<i>Let's ditch work later. We'll hang out.</i>

222
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,960
<i>I can't, I'm busy.</i>

223
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,680
<i>I haven't seen you for over three hours.</i>

224
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:35,880
<i>What are you doing?</i>

225
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:44,400
<i>I'm alone on the rooftop, drinking coffee.</i>

226
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,840
<i>Why is your ex-boyfriend there?</i>

227
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:10,720
Who was it?

228
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:14,840
Are you talking to me?

229
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:16,800
Who else?

230
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,000
I thought you said

231
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,040
that we should act like strangers
when we're alone.

232
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,480
I was venting my anger.

233
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,480
Well, you have said plenty.

234
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:31,000
Haven't you been telling our colleagues
how awful your ex was?

235
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,040
I said I was venting my anger.

236
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,240
This is for you.

237
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,280
HE FANXING

238
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,560
Your name is on it.

239
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,600
I couldn't throw it away.

240
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,360
Why don't you use it?

241
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,640
The cup has done nothing wrong.

242
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,240
Indeed.

243
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,560
One shouldn't vent out their anger
on things.

244
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,160
Thank you.

245
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:14,880
Are you not mad anymore?

246
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,680
Haven't you been angry?

247
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,840
I was rude before.

248
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,680
I've thought it over.

249
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:25,440
It's better to study abroad.

250
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:27,560
I wish to learn architecture.

251
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,560
When I said I didn't want to go,

252
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,040
it wasn't on impulse.

253
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,320
But I didn't discuss it with you.

254
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,520
It was my fault.

255
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,080
Between the two of us,

256
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,160
you have always tolerated me.

257
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,080
Not exactly.

258
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,480
As someone older than you,

259
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,760
I had a lot of concerns.

260
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:51,880
It's true

261
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,800
that you had been treated unfairly.

262
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,120
No, I wasn't.

263
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:01,240
I was really happy when I was with you.

264
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,760
It's normal for you to be concerned.

265
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:08,840
My behavior made you feel insecure.

266
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:22,840
Since we have reflected on ourselves,

267
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:26,760
realized each other's virtues,
and the problem between us,

268
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,040
let's make peace.

269
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:31,720
Sure.

270
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,960
I'm leaving the company tomorrow.

271
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:36,800
I don't want you to hate me
or refuse to see me.

272
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,360
That's impossible.

273
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,520
It should end on a good note.

274
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,000
Even after breaking up,

275
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,160
we can still be friends.

276
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,640
So will you reply to my texts,

277
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,080
pick up my calls,

278
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:53,120
and say yes when I ask you to hang out?

279
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,080
Aren't you going abroad?

280
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:01,680
By then, I won't be able to ask you out
even if I want to.

281
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,440
I still have plenty of time.

282
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,400
Can I treat you to a meal this weekend?

283
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:13,520
Come to my house. I learned a new dish.

284
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,880
I don't know if I succeeded.

285
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,080
-Ms. He!
-Ms. He!

286
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,720
-Ms. He!
-Buy us a meal!

287
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:21,840
Buy us a meal!

288
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,080
I want a feast!

289
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,280
Australian lobster.

290
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:26,800
The most expensive one!

291
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,440
Why should I?

292
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,920
You now have a boyfriend!

293
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:34,000
You should introduce him to us.

294
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,360
Boyfriend?

295
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,640
-Whose boyfriend?
-Ms. He's!

296
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,920
It's Mr. Ye who sent you home
after karaoke!

297
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:43,760
Look.

298
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,840
Don't tell me he's playing a prank on me.

299
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:49,920
Why did he do this?

300
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:53,280
You have to treat us! It must be a feast.

301
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,960
It's Ms. He's first love!

302
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:58,040
It's worth celebrating.

303
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,360
Whoever heard it is invited.

304
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:02,000
I'm informing our party squad!

305
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,520
-Go.
-Wait.

306
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:06,760
That's fast.

307
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,560
Not really.

308
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,480
They've known each other for a few months.

309
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,040
That's weird.

310
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,120
Doesn't he have probation?

311
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,640
Are you silly?

312
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,440
Why would you need that?

313
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:23,920
Of course, you would want the whole world
to know that you're dating.

314
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:32,800
Now the whole company knows
I have a boyfriend.

315
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,160
Even Mr. Li asked me to buy him a meal.

316
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:39,320
You weren't returning
my messages or calls.

317
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,640
What was I supposed to do?

318
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:43,080
What if he wants to get back with you?

319
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,680
You think too much.

320
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,440
<i>Then why was he there?</i>

321
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,400
He's going abroad to study.

322
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:53,040
He wanted to thank me and bid me farewell.

323
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,480
<i>Listen.</i>

324
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:57,600
<i>As a leader,
I win my people over by virtue.</i>

325
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:01,960
That's why whoever leaves
will drop by to sincerely thank me.

326
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,080
Win them over by virtue?

327
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,480
But you're senseless.

328
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,320
-Hey--
-Cong Xiao has discussed with the rest.

329
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,400
<i>I'm treating them to a seafood feast.</i>

330
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,320
What?

331
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,480
Professor He!

332
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,920
What a coincidence seeing you here!

333
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,720
Says the one
who has been waiting beside my car.

334
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,080
You haven't eaten, right?

335
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,320
It's still early.

336
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,960
Come, I'm buying you dinner.

337
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,320
What's wrong? Let's eat anything you want.

338
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:45,960
Don't worry about the money.

339
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,760
My uncle always brings me here.

340
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,880
He has a prepaid card,
so I'll put it on his tab.

341
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,840
Don't hold back. You can order more.

342
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:09,000
Fine, you have bought me a meal.

343
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,480
So what is it?

344
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:16,040
Can't I just simply buy you a meal?

345
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,880
Stop focusing on my shortcomings.

346
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,840
I have many virtues too.

347
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:26,880
What are they?

348
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,640
For example,
I have a great family background.

349
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,160
I don't have any burdens.

350
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,880
I am quite pretty
and have a good personality.

351
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,680
I am also kind.

352
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:40,360
In fact, I can be sexy.

353
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,360
Your hairstyle is quite unique.

354
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,320
Does it look good?

355
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,680
You can be the child
of Golden-haired Lion King.

356
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:53,520
It's fine if you don't like it.

357
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:54,720
It's not permanent.

358
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,240
It'll go back to before after I wash it.

359
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:58,840
Don't worry, it won't affect your results.

360
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,480
I'm done eating.

361
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:19,960
You didn't eat much.

362
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:24,000
Eating isn't important.
I have something for you.

363
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:32,480
I don't know what a man your age likes,

364
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,240
but I think you will like it.

365
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:39,560
Open it only after I am gone.

366
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:43,280
I'm very patient,
so think it over before you answer.

367
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:48,680
It's not money, right?

368
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:40,960
<i>Dear Professor He,</i>

369
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:44,040
<i>I don't know when I started </i>

370
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,440
<i>to have feelings for you.</i>

371
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,960
<i>Maybe it was when
you called out my name in class.</i>

372
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:53,680
<i>Maybe it was when you cleared
my name at the office.</i>

373
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:57,080
<i>Maybe it was when you couldn't bear
to shut me out.</i>

374
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:01,320
<i>I started to notice that
you have such a tender heart</i>

375
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,600
<i>beneath your wild facade.</i>

376
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:06,960
<i>Anyway,</i>

377
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,920
<i>I'm falling for you.</i>

378
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:13,080
<i>I don't know how it started,
but I am now deeply in love with you.</i>

379
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:16,480
<i>I want to turn into a light feather,</i>

380
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,200
<i>and fall into the palm of your hands.</i>

381
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:24,120
This is so cheesy.

382
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:56,480
Professor He!

383
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:58,680
So how is it?

384
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:01,000
-How did you get here?
-I came here by taxi.

385
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:04,280
You might want to answer me now,
so I have been waiting for you.

386
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,600
Cai Minmin.

387
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,400
I have read the letter,

388
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,000
so I will give you the answer now.

389
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,280
No.

390
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:16,760
No?

391
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,520
Don't you like Yuan Song?

392
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:22,240
He has broken up with his girlfriend,
so you can court him now.

393
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:23,640
You two are a perfect match.

394
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:24,960
I'll support you.

395
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,440
I can write you a courting plan
or something.

396
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:32,520
How does that sound?

397
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,280
It's too late for that.

398
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,080
Why didn't you help me before?

399
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,040
I don't like him anymore.

400
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:42,280
I like you.

401
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,120
My answer is still no.

402
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,640
I have my limits.

403
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,720
I will never date any of my students.

404
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:53,080
How about you wait for two years?

405
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,200
I'll consider it again after you graduate.

406
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,240
Two years?

407
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,960
Well, two years will pass by quickly.

408
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:02,920
Then...

409
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,360
Then does it mean that

410
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,320
you won't date other girls
for the next two years?

411
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,240
Of course...

412
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:10,200
I will.

413
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,840
You're brushing me off.

414
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,080
I thought you would date anyone.

415
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,440
Who told you that?

416
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,840
They said you like pretty and sexy girls.

417
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,920
I believe that I'm good looking.

418
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,840
I'm not ugly.

419
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,200
Or do you think that I'm not sexy enough?

420
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,080
This should be enough.

421
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,280
No. That's not what I meant.

422
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,520
I'm a teacher and you're a student.

423
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,840
Those are our roles.

424
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:45,160
It's fine to be friends, but not lovers.

425
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:48,480
Is it just because you're a teacher
and I'm a student?

426
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,520
It is the main reason.

427
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:57,920
Forget it.

428
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,200
I'm leaving.

429
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,800
Go back to school and don't run around!

430
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,040
Did you hear me?

431
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:19,640
That executive director
was your girlfriend?

432
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,440
It's ex-girlfriend now.

433
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:27,040
And you had your internship
at Amazing Decoration?

434
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:29,960
I was still too late.

435
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:34,440
When I went to your company that day,
you actually hid from me.

436
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,120
It's unacceptable.

437
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,760
This is how fate is.

438
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:43,360
Others just slip in
when you loosen your grip.

439
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,280
No.

440
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:48,120
She isn't like that. I know her.

441
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,760
She wouldn't fall
for someone else so soon.

442
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,720
You've made some progress.

443
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:59,080
You're finally confident
in your own charm and her.

444
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:04,000
If she didn't agree because she liked him,

445
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:07,560
it could be because
she wanted to give it a try

446
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:08,920
because they are compatible.

447
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,280
Lighten up, kid.

448
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,120
There's still a long way ahead.

449
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,360
One day, you'll understand.

450
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:18,240
Life is not always a smooth ride.

451
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,280
No.

452
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,280
I won't accept it.

453
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,920
What will you do then? Get her back?

454
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,080
Of course.

455
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:28,920
Have you thought about
how you're going to do it?

456
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:35,440
She officially has a boyfriend now.

457
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:38,200
You can't just brazenly get her back.

458
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,080
Meiyin.

459
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:43,520
Please help me.

460
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,920
Help you?

461
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,000
Helping should be mutual.

462
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,120
If I help you,

463
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:54,800
will you help me?

464
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:02,840
Fine, we'll help each other.

465
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:03,800
How's that?

466
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:07,600
Deal.

467
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:15,520
Good.

468
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:16,800
Now tell me.

469
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:19,680
If I can't do it openly,
then how should I do it?

470
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,720
Don't you have a living example?

471
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:27,480
Just do whatever the old fox did.

472
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,200
Beat him at his own game.

473
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,280
Do you understand?

474
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:37,920
You little thing,

475
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,880
now you know how to go after a girl.

476
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:52,360
Goodness, Canyang always sleeps
until the afternoon during the weekends.

477
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,120
-Let me wake him up.
-Wait.

478
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,800
Don't mind him. Just let him sleep.

479
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,480
Right, you have finally received
your walking shoes.

480
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,280
What else did you buy with Ye Luming?

481
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,480
We bought a fryer.

482
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,640
An air fryer.

483
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:17,640
Your dad loves fried food.

484
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:19,480
Too much oil is bad for health.

485
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:22,520
If you really want it,
just ask him to get you one.

486
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,120
You don't have to join any group deals.

487
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,200
It's such a hassle.

488
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:28,800
If I get a group deal,
I can save over 300 yuan.

489
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:32,720
Also, who are we to him?

490
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,440
Why should he buy it for us?

491
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,080
He's my boyfriend.

492
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:41,840
My dear daughter.

493
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,400
Don't lie to me.

494
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:48,000
Were you really not trying
to deceive Mrs. Wang before this?

495
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,040
Why would I deceive her?

496
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,440
Are you perhaps imitating
those Internet celebrities?

497
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:55,800
Renting a boyfriend
to deal with your parents?

498
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,600
Why would I do that?
You never urged me to get married.

499
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:01,440
But even Luming himself didn't know.

500
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:03,600
I just decided it yesterday.

501
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,080
Really?

502
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:11,400
So what is the progress between you two?

503
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:13,920
-Mom.
-What now?

504
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,320
Fine, I won't ask.

505
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:25,200
How about you call Luming over
for lunch at our house?

506
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,920
He lives alone.

507
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,760
Isn't it great if he can eat with us?

508
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:30,680
Don't.

509
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:32,440
They just got together.

510
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:34,280
Young couples prefer to have a date
by themselves.

511
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:37,520
What's the point of calling him over
to hang out with old people?

512
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:39,440
You're right.

513
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:43,040
Hey, I'd better call her second aunt

514
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:44,600
-and tell her.
-Mom!

515
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:47,080
What? I'm here.

516
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:50,640
It's awkward to tell everyone
about such a small thing.

517
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,040
What's so awkward about it?

518
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:55,800
I must call your second aunt
and tell her right now.

519
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:59,000
I just want to try dating him
while keeping it discreet.

520
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:02,440
Why do you have to make
such a big deal out of it?

521
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:03,720
It's embarrassing.

522
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:04,880
Why is it embarrassing?

523
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:06,520
Why is dating embarrassing?

524
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,640
Dating isn't embarrassing.

525
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,880
But is it something to be glorious about?

526
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:15,240
If that's not honorable,
then being single is?

527
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,920
I'm not lying, so why can't I
share the good news with her?

528
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:22,520
I finally know
why you don't let me visit her.

529
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,400
Is being single so shameful?

530
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:26,280
I'm not ashamed of it.

531
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:29,240
But the way you're acting
like your daughter is finally taken

532
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:30,320
is embarrassing.

533
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:36,000
Hongmei.

534
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:43,240
I'm done eating.

535
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:45,880
Hey, Fanxing...

536
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:56,880
I argued with my mom.

537
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,520
<i>It must be your fault.</i>

538
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,800
<i>Yes, it must be your fault.</i>

539
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,120
Be the judge for me.

540
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,600
I have just decided to try dating,

541
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:08,000
yet she already wants to tell
all our relatives.

542
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:10,920
<i>You should respect their social need.</i>

543
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:14,760
One of the elders' topics
is their children's marriage.

544
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:17,120
Your mom has always been
at a disadvantage.

545
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:18,760
Now she can finally blend in.

546
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:21,040
<i>-Why did you argue with her?
-That's right.</i>

547
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:24,360
Besides, your mom isn't like
those long-winded women.

548
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:26,360
Hey.

549
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,360
She's not like Peanut's grandma

550
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:31,160
who would break a bowl
and let the whole community know.

551
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:33,960
People change.

552
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:38,000
I can feel that
she has been nagging more this year.

553
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,680
<i>People grow old.</i>

554
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,200
<i>Old people are the same.</i>

555
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,400
Like last year,

556
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,560
my mom was still able to go hiking.

557
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:46,960
But this year, her legs hurt.

558
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:49,080
I asked her to go for a checkup.

559
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:50,360
It turned out to be osteoporosis.

560
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:54,160
<i>He Fanxing, just grow up and ask yourself.</i>

561
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:56,200
Has she ever forced you
to go on a blind date?

562
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,120
No, right?

563
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:01,120
It's because she doesn't want you
to be picked on by others.

564
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:04,120
<i>She defends your dignity
and takes care of you.</i>

565
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,720
Now you're saying she has been nagging.

566
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,040
But what about you?

567
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:09,000
I didn't nag her.

568
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:12,360
<i>In the community, their main activity</i>

569
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:14,480
is to talk about
every little thing in life.

570
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,840
That's the basic session.

571
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:18,440
The comparison session
is the most important.

572
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,320
<i>"Does your child have a partner?"</i>

573
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,400
<i>"Are they married?"</i>

574
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:23,800
<i>"What do their partners do?
How much do they earn?"</i>

575
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:25,240
<i>"Do they have children?"</i>

576
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:27,320
<i>"Is it a boy or a girl?
How many are they having?"</i>

577
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:31,960
There are two types of families
that are the center of gossip.

578
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:36,160
Like your family
and Mrs. Wang's family from downstairs.

579
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:39,960
<i>Your family is a negative example
of this session</i>

580
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:42,880
<i>while Mrs. Wang's family
is the winner in life.</i>

581
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:44,280
<i>That's right.</i>

582
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:47,080
<i>Since Mrs. Wang's
twin granddaughters were born,</i>

583
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,560
<i>she has climbed to the top.</i>

584
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:52,480
So will my mom climb to the top
once I have gotten a boyfriend?

585
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:55,480
The point is, Ye is an exceptional man.

586
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:57,360
He can blow their socks off.

587
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:00,480
Don't you think your mom deserves
to hear fewer bitter words?

588
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:01,680
Right.

589
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,120
Song Xue is right.

590
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:04,760
<i>Who are you talking to?</i>

591
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,480
He Fanxing and Song Xue.

592
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:10,600
<i>It has been a while!</i>

593
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:11,760
<i>Hello, Mrs. Yang.</i>

594
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,280
<i>Hello, girls.</i>

595
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:16,600
<i>Have Song Xue and Dongyang
picked a wedding date?</i>

596
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:18,880
Mrs. Yang, we have been busy.

597
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,760
-We haven't decided yet.
-Goodness.

598
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:23,200
Marriage is the greatest thing in life.

599
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,080
What could be more important?

600
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:27,760
How else can you register
your child's birth?

601
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:28,720
Mom.

602
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,800
<i>I told you they don't plan to have kids.</i>

603
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:33,800
<i>If you don't have kids,
what will happen when you're old?</i>

604
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:36,520
<i>That's enough, they are busy.</i>

605
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,360
<i>I'm going to clean then.</i>

606
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:40,880
<i>Come and visit soon.</i>

607
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,000
<i>Sure, Mrs. Yang.</i>

608
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:44,720
Peanut.

609
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,480
Have you finished eating?

610
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:47,760
She's done.

611
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:50,280
-Help her change. Her clothes are dirty.
-Let's go.

612
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:52,200
<i>You girls continue.</i>

613
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:56,760
She's gone.

614
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:59,200
That's why I don't visit
when your mom is home.

615
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,560
She nags me every time I go there.

616
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:05,000
By the way, how long
is Fanfan's business trip?

617
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:07,440
Three days. He will be back tonight.

618
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:10,000
That's right. Why didn't Doggy join us?

619
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,480
<i>He's still sleeping.</i>

620
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:13,920
I have to go, so I'm hanging up.

621
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:16,480
-<i>Me too. I have to check on Peanut.</i>
-Okay.

622
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:17,840
<i>-Bye.
-Okay, bye.</i>

623
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:18,840
<i>Bye.</i>

624
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:22,120
Why didn't you tell them
that you're not home?

625
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:24,240
What should I say?

626
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:28,400
That I'm going to do an unspeakable thing
with Professor Song?

627
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:31,000
-Hey. What unspeakable thing?
-Hey.

628
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:33,200
-Watch your mouth.
-My bad.

629
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,920
I meant catching a cheating partner.

630
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:43,520
Look.

631
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:46,080
This sentence isn't right.

632
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,520
How is Xu Beihong's painting of horses

633
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,520
related to the war?

634
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:51,920
It does.

635
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,000
It's an interpretation of the people's
state of mind in that era.

636
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:58,960
That sounds right.

637
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:02,960
Hey.

638
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:05,440
Who said she wanted
to get first place in the test?

639
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:08,080
We're doing the research
while you're playing on your phone.

640
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,800
I'm not playing on my phone.

641
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:13,320
I'm catching a cheater in the act.

642
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:15,560
What do you mean?

643
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:17,240
You don't even have a boyfriend.

644
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:19,960
Does Professor He have a new girlfriend?

645
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:22,000
What does it have to do with Professor He?

646
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:23,800
She confessed to Professor He.

647
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,560
She confessed to Professor He?

648
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:34,000
But she was rejected.

649
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:36,360
-When did this happen?
-Yesterday.

650
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:39,800
Melon is so efficient.

651
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:46,040
When I had feelings for Yuan Song,

652
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,400
I was so reserved.

653
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:50,600
In the end, he was still not mine.

654
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,920
Now that I have moved on,

655
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:57,760
I learned from my last defeat
and took the initiative.

656
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,880
You are a girl
who is brutally tortured by love.

657
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:05,600
You've found him cheating
before dating him.

658
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:09,280
This is even worse than
when you liked Yuan Song.

659
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:11,400
Does Professor He's romance ever stop?

660
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:13,040
I am his new romance.

661
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:16,080
This is an old romance
with someone who is taken.

662
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:22,280
Who is it?

663
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,360
Who?

664
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,440
Judging by your expression...

665
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:30,000
Do we know her?

666
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,760
Is she a professor at our school?

667
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:40,600
I'm only telling you

668
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:43,400
because you two
are my most trusted friends.

669
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,360
You have to keep this to yourselves.

670
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:58,520
What do you mean by this?

671
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,120
Professor Song?

672
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,080
What about her?

673
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:04,400
Can't you see?

674
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,280
If they are clean,

675
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,720
what are they doing at a hotel
on a weekend?

676
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,640
This is Professor He's hand.

677
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:13,440
You can tell from the way
he holds the cup.

678
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:16,800
Most people would hold a cup
with their index and middle fingers.

679
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:20,040
He likes to hold the cup alluringly
with three fingers

680
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:21,440
and stick up his pinky.

681
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:23,000
Like holding a wine glass.

682
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:24,480
Look at this.

683
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,080
This is the logo of Holiday Inn.

684
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:29,920
They are at a café in the hotel lobby.

685
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:33,320
They are at a hotel café
early in the morning.

686
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,200
Isn't that suspicious?

687
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:38,320
But Professor Song said
she's waiting for someone.

688
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:42,120
Isn't it too early
to meet someone on a weekend?

689
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:44,440
It looks like

690
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,640
they just spent the night there

691
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,880
and are having their morning coffee.

692
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:54,160
You girls really have a wild imagination.

693
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:55,840
You know nothing.

694
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,360
All girls in love are Sherlock Holmes.

695
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:02,240
There is only one truth.

696
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:04,560
This is a deduction.

697
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,920
I still think that
you are overthinking this.

698
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,520
They are close friends.

699
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:10,640
I don't see anything going on.

700
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:15,160
You're right.

701
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:17,760
They were high school friends.

702
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:19,720
It's normal to be close.

703
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,280
I'd better ask him directly.

704
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:25,560
Even if you do,
he will say that they are just friends.

705
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:27,320
Professor He.

706
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:29,640
Where are you?

707
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:32,600
<i>Of course, I'm at home.</i>

708
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:52,800
Why didn't you ask He Fanxing
to catch him in the act with you?

709
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:57,080
She needs to date on the weekends.

710
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:01,360
But He Fanxing is really a capable woman

711
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,920
to be dating two different types of men
in three months.

712
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,360
I was wondering why
the twins of the He family

713
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:10,080
have such different luck in relationships.

714
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:12,760
So she wasn't enlightened yet.

715
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:17,040
As members of the He family,
we are naturally popular.

716
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:19,920
I had your fortune told.

717
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:22,480
You only have 12 years of good luck.

718
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:25,000
It is ending soon.
No one will want you soon.

719
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:26,640
Don't curse me.

720
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,160
Yesterday,
I received a handwritten love letter.

721
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:32,720
In this society

722
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,000
where people are communicating
through texts,

723
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:38,160
I still received
a handwritten love letter.

724
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:39,480
Handwritten.

725
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:41,600
How precious and sincere.

726
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:47,160
As long as you still feel precious
and sincere after you have broken up.

727
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:50,400
To keep this preciousness and sincerity,

728
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:51,760
I turned her down.

729
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:53,480
You actually turned her down.

730
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:56,640
Was it because she's ugly?

731
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:58,000
She isn't.

732
00:42:58,320 --> 00:42:59,360
Then you don't like her?

733
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:02,360
I wouldn't say that.

734
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:04,000
