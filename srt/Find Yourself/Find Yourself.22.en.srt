1
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,240
My dear daughter, wake up.

2
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,120
Eat your medicine.

3
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,680
My dear daughter?

4
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,280
My dear daughter.

5
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,600
I made you breakfast.

6
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,320
Eat some.

7
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,800
I don't want to.

8
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,680
Okay, you can eat when you're hungry.

9
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,120
Aren't you working today?

10
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,840
I'm taking a day off.

11
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,720
Don't cover your head.

12
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,880
It's stuffy. Your cold won't recover.

13
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,120
Is she okay?

14
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,000
It looks serious.

15
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:04,600
Why don't we let Canyang
take her to the hospital?

16
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,520
Toughing it out isn't the best solution.

17
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,280
-I'll tell Canyang then.
-Okay.

18
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,720
Canyang.

19
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,680
Go see your sister.

20
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,840
She's so sick that she can't even speak.

21
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,040
You must take her...

22
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,520
to the hospital.

23
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,200
Mom, I can explain.

24
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,400
-This is--
-There's no need!

25
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,040
She's so young.

26
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,760
How can you go for such a young girl?

27
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,640
It's a misunderstanding, Mom!

28
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,600
-Misunderstanding?
-She's my student!

29
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,720
-Your student?
-Mom!

30
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,200
How dare you go for your student!

31
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,600
Stand there! Don't run!

32
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,560
-Mrs. He! He did nothing!
-Slowly!

33
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,360
-Slowly!
-Professor He said it wasn't safe

34
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,000
to go back so he took me in!

35
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:02,160
Mom, I did nothing!

36
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,360
Did you not?

37
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,360
Are you okay, Mom?

38
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,480
Mom?

39
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:14,960
My waist.

40
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,840
Mom, I'll stop running. I'll stop.

41
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:17,960
Are you okay?

42
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,760
This girl has a good appetite.

43
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:29,280
Unlike our children. They never eat much.

44
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,680
There's more.

45
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,640
I'll get you more if it's not enough.

46
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,200
She's sleeping. She'll be fine soon.

47
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,240
It's just a cold. She needs some rest.

48
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,920
Okay, let her have some rest.

49
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,760
-Mr. He?
-Yes?

50
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,520
I want to eat more.

51
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,480
Is it too much to ask?

52
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,400
No! It's just a small bowl.

53
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,760
-Come.
-I'll help myself.

54
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,600
No! I'll do it.

55
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:08,120
-Let me do it.
-Mrs. He.

56
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,280
Can I have a stuffed bun?

57
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,520
Sure!

58
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,080
Take it.

59
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:17,120
This pineapple flavor is really delicious.

60
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,480
My parents' biggest dream
is to rear pigs in the city.

61
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,680
You have fulfilled their dream.

62
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,760
What are you saying?
Why are you a teacher?

63
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:32,680
It's fine. Professor He is approachable
because he likes to joke with us.

64
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,280
We enjoy his classes too.

65
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,800
His class is always full.

66
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,280
Really?

67
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,280
I didn't know.

68
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,120
If I were the principal,
I'd definitely fire him.

69
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,440
Here, Minmin.

70
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,240
Thank you, Mr. He.

71
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,880
He can't be fired. Professor He must stay.

72
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,280
When my roommates spread rumors about me,

73
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,520
it was Professor He
who cleared my name for me.

74
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,880
Those who understand
Professor He will know

75
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,680
that he's actually a nice person.

76
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,200
Is he that good?

77
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,560
Yes.

78
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,160
Like yesterday,
Yuan Song broke up with his girlfriend.

79
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,760
I could only ask Professor He for help.

80
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:08,360
Instead of a teacher,

81
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,360
he's more like our dad.

82
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,760
That's too much. I'm not that old.

83
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,320
Eat up.

84
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,000
Hey.

85
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,320
How are you? Are you feeling better?

86
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,200
-I want to pee.
-Okay.

87
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,400
Your sister is so weird.

88
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,600
Why are you still here?

89
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,440
Can't I leave after lunch?

90
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,440
Do you really think this is a pigpen?

91
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,440
Leave now! You have a class later.

92
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,600
Go! Leave!

93
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,800
Braised Meat.

94
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,080
What are you doing, Meaty?

95
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,200
Meaty.

96
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:57,960
Braised Meaty.

97
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,440
Where are you going?

98
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,360
Where did my black tea go?

99
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,840
Maybe it's down here.

100
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,280
It's really here!

101
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,400
What are you thinking?

102
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,080
Why are you looking at me like that?

103
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,120
Do you want some?

104
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:30,960
Meiyin.

105
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,800
You didn't pick up my call

106
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,760
and she has been bothering me.

107
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,000
Yuan Song!

108
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,520
You're here.

109
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:40,800
Come in.

110
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,400
I'll change my shoes.

111
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,240
Hey.

112
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:58,320
Why don't we change our lock
to the one like Canyang's?

113
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,320
If you forget your keys,

114
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,600
just use your thumbprint.

115
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:03,640
VoilÃ .

116
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,800
You can't forget
to bring your fingers, can you?

117
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,680
That one? No, we can't.

118
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,560
Haven't you seen it on television?

119
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,240
Computer decryption
or something like that.

120
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,440
They can unlock it with a password.

121
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,720
No way. That's not safe.

122
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,080
Let me tell you.

123
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,040
Keys are the safest.

124
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,320
Fine, whatever.

125
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:30,040
Why is Fanxing still sleeping?

126
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:32,920
Go and take a look.

127
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,280
-Ask her to eat something.
-All right.

128
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:40,520
Fanxing!

129
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,440
Fanxing! How are you?

130
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,280
Wake up and eat something!

131
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,440
Fanxing!

132
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,680
Where is she?

133
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,480
I quarreled with Dongyang,
so I couldn't bear to stay at home.

134
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,960
I'm taking Fanxing with me
to the countryside for a few days.

135
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:05,360
<i>Song Xue, you can't always quarrel
with Dongyang.</i>

136
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,040
Don't worry, Mrs. He.

137
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,840
We'll reconcile on Monday.

138
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:11,800
<i>Fanxing is sick. I'm worried too.</i>

139
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:14,800
Okay. I'll take care of Fanxing.

140
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,120
Don't worry, Mrs. He.

141
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,680
-<i>Okay.</i>
-Okay, I'm hanging up.

142
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:18,760
<i>All right.</i>

143
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,080
Some say you can't curse love.

144
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:30,200
If I really break up with Dongyang,
it's your fault.

145
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,680
You won't.

146
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:39,120
Sounds like you're getting better.

147
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,840
Hurry. Drink more malva nut juice.

148
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,520
You're really interesting.

149
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,960
Did you dump him or did he dump you?

150
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,000
You broke up,

151
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,720
not divorced.

152
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,480
It was my first love.

153
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,200
You're right.

154
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,440
First love is really different.

155
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:14,200
When I broke up with Canyang,

156
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,200
didn't he prick the word "Xue" on himself
with a needle?

157
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:21,360
He even pricked it at that spot.
How gross!

158
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:25,360
Luckily, Dongyang doesn't know.
Or he'll drag him to get skin grafting.

159
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:31,360
He pricked it there with a needle?

160
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,160
He loved you deeply.

161
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,480
YE LUMING

162
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,760
He called seven to eight times
within half an hour.

163
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,480
The best way to cure a heartbreak

164
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,520
is to develop a new relationship.

165
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,800
It really makes sense.

166
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,040
Why don't you try it?

167
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,600
I'll try going to the monastery.

168
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:13,480
I really think that Ye isn't bad.

169
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:17,680
Isn't a domineering CEO
a classic in love simulators?

170
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,960
You can never go wrong with classics.

171
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,840
What say you, pregnant lady?

172
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,400
Don't talk to me.

173
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,800
Because I haven't recovered

174
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:34,200
from the huge and shocking news.

175
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,240
Take your time then.

176
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,640
Your sister pays for
the gas and electricity.

177
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,800
The gas card must be with her.

178
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,480
Don't rummage through her stuff!

179
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,320
She'll scold you when she's back.

180
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,560
Why don't you call and ask her?

181
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,080
She switched off her phone!

182
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,760
I won't look at other things.

183
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,600
What secrets can she have?

184
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,720
EIGHTY-FIVE DAYS FROM NOW,

185
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:20,000
YOU'LL BE WILLING TO TELL EVERYONE
THAT I'M YOUR BOYFRIEND

186
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,960
<i>I think they promised
to try dating for three months.</i>

187
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,520
They would go public if it went well,
and break up if it didn't.

188
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:31,840
He thought he could announce it already,
but his girlfriend thought otherwise.

189
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,360
I don't get it either.

190
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,000
It's not like finding a job.

191
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,640
Why is there a trial period?

192
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,040
It feels oddly familiar somehow.

193
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,440
Mom, I'm going out!

194
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:53,120
Did you find the gas card?

195
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:58,760
Who is it?

196
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,360
You jerk! I lured a thief in, didn't I?

197
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,640
I'll teach you a lesson!

198
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,160
Hey!

199
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,440
Introduce us.

200
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,800
Talk calmly and don't fight.
Do you understand?

201
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,080
-We won't.
-Can I come again?

202
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,280
Only if you kiss me.

203
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,120
We'll get going.

204
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:39,560
Let's go.

205
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:58,720
I thought I'd get beaten up
when we announce our relationship.

206
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,840
Who knew I'd still get beaten up
after breaking up.

207
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,640
Don't you deserve it?

208
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,560
We've already broken up.

209
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,160
I don't think Fanxing told you about it.

210
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,040
She didn't throw it away.

211
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,680
Shouldn't you explain it?

212
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,120
You already know.

213
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:30,840
What's there to explain?

214
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,840
I introduced you to her company.

215
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:36,560
But you hooked up with her secretly.
How is that reasonable?

216
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,720
Why not?

217
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,520
Do you want to get beaten up again?

218
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,800
Come at me if you want! I don't care!

219
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,040
She is a liar!

220
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,720
She said we'd make it official.

221
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,920
But after three months, she dumped me!

222
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,960
You want to beat me after she dumped me?

223
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,480
Fine, come at me!

224
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:54,200
Your whole family is bullying me! Hit me!

225
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,000
-Hey!
-Hit me!

226
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,400
There's no point in living anymore!

227
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,320
Don't mess with me!

228
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,480
Hey. Don't cry.

229
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:15,840
I didn't hit you.

230
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:17,760
I...

231
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:18,920
I was just asking.

232
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,400
I just can't accept it.

233
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,600
Why do we need your acceptance to date?

234
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:25,840
Hey.

235
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:30,200
Including the time inside my mom's belly,
I've been with her for 33 years.

236
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,240
I know everything!

237
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:34,520
But she dated my student.

238
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,520
Wouldn't you be mad?

239
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,160
Don't bully me.

240
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,800
Go lecture her if you want.

241
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,600
She was the one who played me!

242
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,080
Play?

243
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,680
Can you be more mature?

244
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,520
Breakups and reconciliations are normal.

245
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,200
I'm immature and young.
That's why I was tricked!

246
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:53,080
That's why I trusted her
and we dated for three months.

247
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,000
Okay.

248
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,320
This is really...

249
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,080
Come! Hit me on the head!

250
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:05,280
-Hey!
-Your family always bullies me!

251
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,400
All the time. Come!

252
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,880
I have no reason to live!

253
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,000
-Gosh!
-Come at me!

254
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,840
Nobody is bullying you!

255
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:15,240
Fanxing's partner is my brother-in-law.
I need to protect my pride too!

256
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,720
What a crybaby.

257
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:18,880
Scram!

258
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,400
Have you two done it?

259
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,040
What?

260
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,400
Have some tea.

261
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:17,240
Since your young boyfriend has decided
to stay here for you,

262
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,000
why did you two break up?

263
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:22,560
He kept it from you
and settled everything perfectly.

264
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,160
How sensible.

265
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,400
Go back and reconcile with him.

266
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:32,160
This is exactly the problem between us.

267
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,600
What is it?

268
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,840
It's a huge matter
that affects his future.

269
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,800
But he let it go because of me.

270
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,840
I can't bear the responsibility.

271
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,800
How is it unbearable?

272
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,400
There must be one

273
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:48,600
who's willing to compromise
between a couple.

274
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:49,800
Right?

275
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:52,160
This is not compromising.

276
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,160
We have a ten-year age gap.

277
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:55,920
We're not in sync.

278
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:58,360
He intended to further his studies.

279
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,040
But because of me,

280
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,480
he sacrificed himself.

281
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:05,160
Doesn't it prove that he loves you?

282
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,760
When you love each other,

283
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:11,120
you'll be easily contented.

284
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:13,320
But when the relationship turns sour

285
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,240
or when life doesn't go his way,

286
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:19,400
he'd think that all the sacrifices
he made entirely out of love

287
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,480
are regretful and stupid.

288
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,360
He'd always wish

289
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,280
that he never did it.

290
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,840
I don't mind if he doesn't love me.

291
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,000
But I don't wish that

292
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,400
whenever he thinks of me,

293
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:34,960
he feels hatred.

294
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,760
He won't. You've thought too far.

295
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,160
In short,

296
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:42,480
if I can't bring him
towards the right path,

297
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:46,040
I can't be his obstacle in life.

298
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,880
I can't bear the responsibility.

299
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,240
You're saying like if you don't do it,

300
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,720
he'll have a smooth and easy life.

301
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,520
You can't say it like that.

302
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:03,120
Love needs sparks and chemistry.

303
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,440
But you shouldn't make use of it.

304
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:08,040
What do you mean by that?

305
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,440
When he's in love with you,

306
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:13,320
he can forsake everything
and do everything for you.

307
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:15,960
But if you accept it silently,

308
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,680
aren't you making use of it?

309
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,120
Your lives are not in sync.

310
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:23,120
If you were destined
to be with him for a while,

311
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,560
why would you disturb his whole life?

312
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:29,920
Look at you two. Why are you so honest?

313
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:34,640
That is a 20-year-old dolphin
with delicate skin.

314
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:37,120
You can never touch it anymore.

315
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,880
What a waste.

316
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,400
Exactly.

317
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,560
I ate with them last time.

318
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,360
When I observed him closely,

319
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,040
his skin was glowing!

320
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,600
It looked so smooth.

321
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,360
But I was too shy to touch him.

322
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:56,320
Why were you shy?

323
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,040
Fortune must be shared!

324
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,840
There's a young dolphin.
Let's touch him together.

325
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,240
We won't bite him.

326
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:03,600
It's great now.

327
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,040
Fanxing has released him into the wild.

328
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,520
Released him into the wild?

329
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,440
Hey.

330
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:11,680
I broke up.

331
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,040
You two are still fantasizing
about my ex-boyfriend.

332
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:18,400
Do you have empathy or conscience?

333
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,880
Of course, we empathize with you.

334
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,520
But we don't pity you.

335
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,920
No matter what reason you have,

336
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:29,440
a breakup means the one
who got dumped is the most pitiful.

337
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,760
Kids nowadays are vulnerable.

338
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:34,280
They can't bear hardships.

339
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:37,760
If they are mentally troubled,

340
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,080
they may go down the wrong path

341
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,280
and be an alcoholic and whatnot.

342
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:45,600
If it's serious,
they might commit suicide.

343
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:47,640
You think too much!

344
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:50,680
But...

345
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:53,960
He knew you went to your gathering
with someone else.

346
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,680
Why didn't he argue with you?

347
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,440
Instead, he confessed to you.

348
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,440
It's a gamble.

349
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:02,240
Relationships need a breakthrough.

350
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,200
Like bugs emerging from cocoons.

351
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:06,280
It'll be a butterfly if it's successful.

352
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,240
If not, it'll die inside.

353
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,640
In the end, Yuan Song failed.

354
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,800
Like a moth attracted to flames!

355
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,640
This moth knows
that the fire is dangerous.

356
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:22,320
But he likes it.

357
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,120
Don't worry.

358
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,040
There's no butterfly, moth or fire.

359
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,120
There's nothing.

360
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,560
We simply broke up.

361
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:31,720
He's just 22.

362
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,880
He'll only drink for three to four days,

363
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:38,520
feel sad for five to six days
and recover on the seventh day.

364
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,000
He can start a new relationship
on the eighth day.

365
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:43,680
Hey.

366
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,800
Can we end this topic

367
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,320
and fish silently?

368
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,560
You scared the fishes away.

369
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:51,360
Keep quiet.

370
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:03,800
Who is it?

371
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,000
Why is he calling me now?

372
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,440
Darn it!

373
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,040
He's crazy!

374
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,360
This Ye

375
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,400
is quite persistent.

376
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,600
Persistence is the way
to win Fanxing over.

377
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:24,520
With her cold temperament,
when will they be together?

378
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,680
Classics are the best.

379
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,680
They know how to observe
and use the correct method.

380
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,880
But he's 37!

381
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:34,280
His skin isn't as smooth as the dolphin.

382
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,880
But he wins with his financial ability.

383
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39,400
He's crafty too.

384
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:42,320
He might look handsome as well.

385
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:43,680
Fanxing.

386
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:45,480
Any photos of him?

387
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,280
-What?
-Let us see.

388
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,000
What's there to see?

389
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,920
Let's see if he's good for you. Show us!

390
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,120
This afternoon,

391
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,760
you two were still pitying
my ex-boyfriend.

392
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,200
That's another matter.

393
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:06,880
We have to move forward.

394
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,240
Just one look!

395
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:25,280
He looks nice.

396
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,120
He's handsome.

397
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,440
You two

398
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,520
look like a couple in this photo.

399
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:36,560
Are you two-timing?

400
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,520
What two-timing?

401
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:44,160
Let me tell you.

402
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:46,160
I was totally duped.

403
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:47,800
Back then, he told me

404
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:50,360
if he didn't send a photo
of his girlfriend to his sister,

405
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:53,360
she'd sign him up for <i>If You Are The One</i>.

406
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:56,880
I think he should get on the show!

407
00:26:57,080 --> 00:27:00,080
I'll film a recommendation video
for him as a friend!

408
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,880
Why are you so mad?

409
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,720
Think about it in a good way.

410
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,640
He may be crafty,

411
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,160
but that's because he likes you.

412
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:13,200
What kind of reason is that?
Can you lie if you like someone?

413
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:17,080
Song Xue, say something.

414
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:20,360
This is an outflanking tactic.

415
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:23,800
When you're weaker
and refuse to go head-on,

416
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:27,800
you save your strength and tackle
the enemy's weakness one by one.

417
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:31,200
You think he was lying to you,
but I think he's very smart.

418
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,440
He put a lot of effort into it too.

419
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,000
You had a boyfriend,
so being your friend was the only way.

420
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,360
Slow and steady.

421
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,440
Professor Song, you're so educated.

422
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,120
Slow and steady?

423
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:44,920
That's going for a shortcut.

424
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,320
You're right.

425
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:50,800
It was unkind of him
to do something like this.

426
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,160
I can't think about it.

427
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:57,080
How will people look at me?

428
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,520
They'd think I was slutty.

429
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,800
I can't digest it.

430
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,240
How gross.

431
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:06,080
What can't you digest?

432
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:08,720
It has been so long.

433
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,000
I'm so thirsty.

434
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:21,400
Where are you going?
Don't we know each other?

435
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:24,080
Hello, I'm Ye Luming.

436
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:27,600
The one who you said is unkind
and goes for shortcuts.

437
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,480
Hello, I'm Song Xue.

438
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:31,600
Hello.

439
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:34,080
Hi, I'm Yang Xiaoyu,
Fanxing's best friend.

440
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,520
Hi, how do you do?

441
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,400
Sorry to disturb your gathering.

442
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,000
It's all right.

443
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:42,480
-I heard you run an advertising firm.
-You must be hungry, Ye.

444
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,760
We'll order some barbecue for you.

445
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Okay, thanks.

446
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,800
-I'm really hungry.
-Let's go.

447
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,480
-I'll come with you.
-Hey.

448
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:50,480
Sit down.

449
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,760
Talk to him. You'll be fine.

450
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,520
What a coincidence.

451
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,080
You're here too.

452
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:08,000
Why didn't you answer my calls?

453
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,720
Who are you to me? Why should I answer?

454
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,000
Didn't we reconcile?

455
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,240
When did we?

456
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,520
Fine, we didn't.

457
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:22,600
You didn't answer my calls,
so I had to come to you.

458
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:25,120
If I give up after you shun me,

459
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,960
then we won't be able
to be friends anymore.

460
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,360
What about you?

461
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,120
Be whatever you want to be.

462
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,720
Sit wherever you like.

463
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:35,360
I won't argue or play riddles with you.

464
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:38,360
Thirty calls in a day.

465
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,760
It's like calling to kill me.

466
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:44,040
When Tan Sanzang chants spells,
he needs to take a breath too.

467
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,120
Okay.

468
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:48,440
Okay, I know what you mean.
We can take it slow.

469
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,280
Take it slow? Who's taking it slow?

470
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:56,600
You had a boyfriend.
You didn't know I like you.

471
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,200
But now, things are different.

472
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:02,160
It's okay if you don't like me now.

473
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,560
You don't hate me anyway.

474
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,200
We can take things slow.

475
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:10,680
Back then, I only treated you as a friend.

476
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:11,760
A friend.

477
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:14,600
Not bad.

478
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,320
Look.

479
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:19,080
We get along and you don't hate me.

480
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:23,040
So let's be friends on the premise
that we'll date in the future.

481
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:26,400
Let's develop our relationship.
You'll discover something new.

482
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:30,120
I just broke up with my ex-boyfriend.

483
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:32,280
Are you asking me
to develop our relationship?

484
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,680
You broke up! Now's the best timing!

485
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,080
Should I wait until you're old,
dead and buried

486
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,760
to marry your buried neighbor?

487
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:41,600
Can't you say nice things?

488
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,080
I can.

489
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:47,560
When you're my girlfriend,
I'll say the nicest things.

490
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:50,000
I'll praise you
with different words every day.

491
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:51,600
No, thanks.

492
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,600
It's decided then.

493
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,800
What? What's decided? Who decided it?

494
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:01,000
Don't decide things on your own.

495
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:04,080
It's decided that I'll start pursuing you.

496
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,360
We'll be good friends on the premise

497
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:07,840
that we'll date in the future.

498
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,360
Cheers.

499
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:11,880
Where's your glass?

500
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:13,840
You took mine.

501
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:15,760
Don't be so sensitive.

502
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,840
Here. I'll drink first.

503
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:22,000
You're really blending in
with the fruit juice.

504
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:24,760
I drank too fast.

505
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,920
This Ye

506
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,960
looks okay.

507
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:36,160
I think otherwise.

508
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:37,640
Why?

509
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:41,880
He's too aggressive and flexible.

510
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:43,440
He takes all the limelight.

511
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:46,480
He's not suitable for Fanxing.

512
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,560
On the contrary, domineering men

513
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,360
are more attractive to me.

514
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,520
You have no taste

515
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:58,960
in men.

516
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:45,160
I have my own.

517
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,360
You have good stamina.

518
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,240
I didn't know you go to the gym.

519
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,440
I walk my dog as an exercise.

520
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:00,120
It's better than going to the gym.

521
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,400
A new place can change our mood.

522
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:05,800
Hey.

523
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:08,080
Let's travel abroad next time.

524
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,600
Let's go to Australia.

525
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,200
Or America?

526
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:15,280
Going abroad can develop relationships.

527
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:18,720
No.

528
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,240
My English is awful.

529
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,480
So you're fine with going abroad with me.

530
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:26,280
The problem is the language.

531
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:33,520
Actually,

532
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:36,960
I don't know how to handle
this kind of situation.

533
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:38,200
What kind of situation?

534
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,960
To be defensive and offensive.

535
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:44,320
I know you're joking most of the time.

536
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:47,760
But if I say yes,
you'll take it seriously.

537
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:49,880
It feels...

538
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:53,760
slick.

539
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,600
I have no choice.

540
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:00,480
When someone's at a disadvantage

541
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:02,160
and wants to keep his pride,

542
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:06,000
he can only become a slimy loach.

543
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:08,840
At a disadvantage?

544
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:10,400
You?

545
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,320
Loach?

546
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,600
Although I talk aggressively
and act proactively,

547
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:21,560
I'm the one courting you.

548
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:24,160
When I'm courting you,

549
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:26,160
that means I'm at a disadvantage.

550
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:30,600
If the weak intends to keep his pride,

551
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:35,040
he has to speak carefully
to leave an alternate route for himself.

552
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,960
To be honest,

553
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:42,240
you're a good person.

554
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:43,880
Why are you friend-zoning me?

555
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,320
Take it back!

556
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:47,200
Why are you shouting?

557
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,040
I really think you're a good person!

558
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,240
What are you looking at?

559
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:54,240
You said you're a loach.
You're obviously a king cobra!

560
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,560
I still don't like it! Take it back!

561
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:58,280
I'm giving it to you!

562
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,840
Enjoy the view! I'm leaving.

563
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,200
Take it back!

564
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,520
Take it back!

565
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:10,920
-Don't follow me!
-Wait up!

566
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:12,160
Go away!

567
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:22,400
Your sister is coming back.
Let's eat together.

568
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:25,720
Can she even eat today?

569
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:29,440
Yes. She isn't a rice bucket like you.

570
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,520
Look at how loyal your sister is.

571
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:32,880
She's sick herself.

572
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:36,960
But when Song Xue and Dongyang quarreled,
she accompanied her on a trip.

573
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:38,160
You're right.

574
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:40,280
Our dear daughter is the nicest.

575
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:44,080
She's careful, obedient,
and has never done anything indecent.

576
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,160
Unlike Canyang.

577
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,000
He is wicked.

578
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,520
He was born rebellious.

579
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,120
Dad!

580
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:53,320
Compared to Fanxing,
I'm really not rebellious.

581
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:55,600
Fanxing is the real rebel.

582
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:59,720
Don't speak ill behind other's back.

583
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,600
How did your sister rebel?

584
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,000
Tell us!

585
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:06,400
She...

586
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:07,800
She's just rebellious!

587
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,400
She's the silent dog that bites.

588
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,280
How dare you?

589
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:13,880
Dad, Mom. I'm back.

590
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:15,800
You're back.

591
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,920
Are you feeling better?

592
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:19,800
Yes, I'm fine.

593
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:21,640
Why did they quarrel?

594
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:24,240
What's rare about it?

595
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:28,120
We mainly went out to relax
with a pregnant lady.

596
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:29,720
That's good.

597
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,600
They're still young and energetic.

598
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:33,160
Look at us old people.

599
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,400
Wash your hands and eat.

600
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:37,280
I'll change my clothes first.

601
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,160
Why are you staring at me?

602
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:44,680
Did you get rabies?

603
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,280
I've tolerated you long enough.

604
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:47,720
Don't anger me.

605
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,600
Or I'll bite you.

606
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:52,320
Lunatic.

607
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,120
Let's see how good you are.

608
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,880
-How rude.
-It's fine.

609
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:00,160
Cut it out.

610
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,920
What's the matter?
Pulling a long face all night.

611
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:18,280
Did I owe you money?

612
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:27,680
Look at what you and Yuan Song did.

613
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:30,480
-I'm telling you.
-You ransacked my drawers!

614
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:32,640
-Fanxing!
-You ransacked my drawers!

615
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,600
-Fanxing!
-I'm warning you!

616
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:37,000
-Don't ransack my drawers!
-No! Listen to me!

617
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:38,400
Do you have a death wish?

618
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:41,280
<i>Mom asked me to look for the gas card!</i>

619
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:42,760
<i>Was I too nice to you?</i>

620
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:44,560
<i>It won't happen again, Fanxing!</i>

621
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,160
<i>I won't do it again.</i>

622
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,440
You even went to his house.

623
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:54,680
What did you ask him?

624
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:56,720
We broke up. Are you happy now?

625
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:58,520
It's not my fault.

626
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:02,000
When I went to find Yuan Song,
you've already broken up.

627
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,160
I wasn't the cause.

628
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:05,960
It's not my fault.

629
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:11,920
It has ended anyway.

630
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,040
Don't tell Mom and Dad!

631
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,440
I won't. Don't worry.

632
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,960
Don't trouble Yuan Song.

633
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,120
I wouldn't dare to.

634
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,480
He almost became my brother-in-law.

635
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:29,920
Hey.

636
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:33,760
How did you cope

637
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:36,680
with seeing your ex-girlfriends

638
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:39,240
after breaking up?

639
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,320
We don't meet.

640
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:46,520
Those who were truly in love
wouldn't be able to become friends.

641
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:51,680
See?

642
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:54,480
I told him we couldn't develop
an office romance.

643
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:00,000
He's still in the office.

644
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:02,080
We have to meet every day.

645
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:05,760
Although he said to act like usual,

646
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:08,240
how can it be the same?

647
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,800
Traces will be left once it's done.

648
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:14,120
It's impossible to be like before.

649
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:21,280
How do you treat
your other male colleagues?

650
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:22,360
I...

651
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:24,360
I greet them normally.

652
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:25,880
Assign them tasks.

653
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:29,960
There's nothing else.

654
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,120
That's it.

655
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:34,080
You're the director.

656
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:37,120
Treat him the way
you treat your subordinates.

657
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:38,440
But remember.

658
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:42,280
You have to be the bigger person
and pretend nothing ever happened.

659
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:46,680
How do I pretend
that nothing ever happened?

660
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:49,080
Two things.

661
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:51,120
Faking it

662
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:52,600
and pretending.

663
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:58,040
Faking it and pretending?

664
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:02,840
Let's have dinner tonight.

665
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:04,480
I'll make Chang Huan pay.

666
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:05,840
We should make good use of him.

667
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,400
I'm busy.

668
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,360
-Morning, Jin.
-Morning.

669
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:10,440
-Morning.
-Morning.

670
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:12,560
I'll get back to work. Do come tonight.

671
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:24,480
Morning, Ms. He. I'm done.

672
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:26,840
Morning.

673
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:31,640
Who is Qingqing making use of so early?

674
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:36,520
<i>Be the bigger person.</i>

675
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,160
<i>Pretend that nothing happened.</i>

676
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:43,360
Jin, Cong Xiao.

677
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:44,920
Ms. He, morning.

678
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:46,360
-Morning.
-Morning.

679
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:48,320
Why are you still here?

680
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:50,040
When are you leaving?

681
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,640
You don't want to see me?

682
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:54,560
Why should I? You're not wooing me.

683
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:57,360
<i>Act natural.</i>

684
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:00,520
-<i>Pretend that nothing happened.</i>
-What kind of girl do you like?

685
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,320
-Do you have a target?
-It depends on my feelings.

686
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,920
My lipstick is so great.

687
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:15,920
It doesn't stain glasses
or come off after a meal.

688
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,320
Most importantly,

689
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,560
it won't come off even after a kiss.

690
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:24,000
As if you tried it before.

691
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:31,520
Did you get a boyfriend?

692
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:33,360
When did it happen?

693
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:35,600
On May 20.

694
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:40,080
From the few thousand yuan's blind date?

695
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:42,560
No, I wasted the money.

696
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:44,800
I took a ride back home

697
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:47,040
and complained about the date
with the driver.

698
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:48,440
In the end,

699
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,600
we got along.

700
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:53,120
Congratulations! Treat us to a meal.

701
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:55,000
No problem.

702
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,840
<i>Next time, I'll greet him.</i>

703
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:01,880
<i>Pretend that nothing ever happened
without any expression.</i>

704
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:06,800
Here's a spot, Yuan Song! Sit here!

705
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:08,800
Come and gossip. Hurry!

706
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:19,320
<i>That's great, He Fanxing.</i>

707
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:21,240
<i>Be the bigger person.</i>

708
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:22,840
<i>Pretend.</i>

709
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,360
You guys go ahead. I'm done.

710
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:35,440
Okay.

711
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:39,040
What's up?

712
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:12,560
The others have left.
Why are you still here?

713
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:23,840
You're leaving the company soon.

714
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:26,000
If you have unfinished tasks,

715
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:27,680
you can ask for help from others.

716
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:34,600
What's the matter?

717
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:37,000
When we're alone,

718
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:38,840
can we act like strangers?

719
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:42,320
