1
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,440
Qingqing!

2
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,320
My boyfriend is picking me up.

3
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,360
Come with us, we can drop you off.

4
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,840
There's no need.
I'll drop Qingqing off along the way.

5
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,400
Okay.

6
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,400
-Then I'll drop Cong Xiao off.
-No, it's all right.

7
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:23,400
Don't be shy. We're good friends.

8
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,840
Why did you come?

9
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,320
You could have informed me.

10
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:43,680
Well, my friend just finished
his overtime work,

11
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,960
so he's giving me a lift
since my house is on the way.

12
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,040
You're here too.

13
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,200
You've misunderstood.

14
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,040
Mr. Ye is here to pick me up.

15
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,160
But we can drop Ms. He off
along the way, right?

16
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,560
There's no need. It's fine.

17
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,040
Don't worry,
we're going in the same direction.

18
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,120
Hop on.

19
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,600
What's the matter?

20
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,280
Should I open the door for you?

21
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,960
No, I can do it myself.

22
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,800
He's really giving me a lift
since my house is on the way.

23
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,200
Give me a lift too
since my house is along the way.

24
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:39,960
Thank you, Mr. Driver.

25
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,240
Mr. Driver?

26
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,280
I'm sorry.

27
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,000
I'm too used to taking cabs.

28
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,080
Thank you, old man.

29
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,400
It's fine. Sit tight now, kid.

30
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,840
This old man will drive you home.

31
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,800
A rich husband came out of nowhere.

32
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,080
I'm confused.

33
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:11,160
Is he Cong Xiao's man or Ms. He's man?

34
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:31,440
Wasn't that just a prank?
Is it that funny?

35
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,800
But you played along so well.

36
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,760
You're the one who really likes pranks.

37
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:36,960
I don't.

38
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,560
I just like to see someone get humiliated.

39
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,000
Not for me.

40
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:44,120
I was just trying to save myself
from the situation.

41
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:50,200
But that didn't seem difficult to handle.

42
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,840
That girl doesn't seem like
she's very experienced.

43
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:57,280
Exactly. That's why she was very obvious.

44
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,440
So I could only resort to an even
more obvious way of telling her

45
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,040
that I won't get in between them,
so she can rest assured.

46
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:08,000
I thought this old man
was your boyfriend, Cong Xiao.

47
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,840
I wish.

48
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:13,280
But this old man, Ye Luming,
already has someone he likes.

49
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,080
He Fanxing, did you hear that?

50
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,400
My goodness!

51
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,800
I didn't know that
our great Ms. He could be shy.

52
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:31,000
Yuan Song, you're going to quit soon,

53
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,520
so I don't mind telling you.

54
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,680
Initially, Ms. He was the one

55
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:37,480
who introduced
this handsome old man to me.

56
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:40,560
But this handsome old man has bad taste.

57
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,720
He fell for her instead.

58
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,920
So this old man is Ms. He's boyfriend?

59
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,600
Almost.

60
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,120
But not quite yet.

61
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,920
You sure talk funny.

62
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,560
Just say no if you're not.

63
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,680
Kid, you have a lot to learn.

64
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,240
Relationships are very tricky.

65
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:06,320
There's no clear line between being
and not being in a relationship.

66
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,040
Theoretically speaking, we aren't dating.

67
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,680
But now,

68
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:14,760
I'm already performing the duties
of a boyfriend.

69
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,840
But you don't have the right to do so.

70
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,920
It doesn't sound mutual.

71
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,920
That's not true.

72
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,800
I've already had breakfast at her house.

73
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,800
I'm already at that level.

74
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,240
Ms. He, are you still pretending?

75
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,680
Isn't he your first love?

76
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,320
-Buy us a meal!
-Can't you all shut up?

77
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,720
Are you going to stop or not?

78
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,280
If you go on, I'll get off!

79
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,080
Ms. He!

80
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,520
By the way,

81
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,320
I forgot to transfer money to you.

82
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,760
What money?

83
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,280
Last time, I made a bet
of 500 yuan with you

84
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,240
that Yuan Song's junior
would conquer him in two months.

85
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,680
Looks like I've lost.

86
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,760
It's all right.

87
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,040
It was just a joke.

88
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,000
No! A bet is a bet.
We have to take it seriously.

89
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,320
If not, where's the fun in that?

90
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,040
-That's right, just take it.
-You really don't have to.

91
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,400
Yuan Song! Over here.

92
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,840
Hey, let me ask you.

93
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,240
What don't you like about Cai Minmin?

94
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,720
It's not that I don't like her.
We're just good friends.

95
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,840
I really don't get youngsters like you.

96
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,840
If there's nothing that you don't like,

97
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,160
why don't you try being together?

98
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:08,320
I had a girlfriend, how could I?

99
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,520
You had a girlfriend?

100
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,640
-Why didn't you tell us?
-That's right.

101
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,320
My girlfriend wanted to keep it a secret.

102
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,080
Sorry, it's ex-girlfriend now.

103
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,720
I just got dumped.

104
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,440
You got dumped?

105
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,680
Who was so blind

106
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,880
to dump the most handsome guy
in Amazing Decoration?

107
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,520
Yes, she's really blind.

108
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,480
Forget it.

109
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,360
She's dying to stay
as far as she can from me.

110
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,640
Why bother chasing her?

111
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:35,080
Since it's already over,
stop thinking about her.

112
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:38,200
Maybe you can consider
that cute junior of yours.

113
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,320
I think you two are a good match.

114
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,040
Everyone knows.

115
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:46,680
One of the ways to cure a heartbreak
is to start a new relationship.

116
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,720
An evil cult must have come up with that.

117
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,120
Of course not!

118
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,960
We tend to lose sight
of the people around us.

119
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,000
She's been a friend or junior for long,

120
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,240
so it feels like
she should remain the same.

121
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,800
But the truth is
you just never thought of her that way.

122
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,160
If you think about it just a bit,

123
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,200
you'll instantly feel enlightened.

124
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:11,640
That makes sense.

125
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,680
I'll meet her this afternoon,

126
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,560
I'll try to think of her that way.

127
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,840
That's more like it.

128
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,320
You have to be like a man.

129
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,960
Men always say to leave it to fate,
but they'll take any pretty girl.

130
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,480
-You're right.
-Am I right, Ms. He?

131
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,040
Yes.

132
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,200
I think that they're a good match too.

133
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:38,160
They are around the same age,
so they should get along.

134
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,000
They'll look like a cute young couple.

135
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,840
The best way to cure a heartbreak

136
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,040
is to start a new relationship.

137
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:47,920
It makes sense.

138
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,320
Give it a try.

139
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,440
I'm done, enjoy your food. I'm on a diet.

140
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,440
Is Ms. He in a bad mood?

141
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:03,920
Is she?

142
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,840
I feel like something's wrong.
Right, Yuan Song?

143
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,440
Maybe menopause came early for her.

144
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,920
The leader of the Five Venoms Cult

145
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,160
is now online.

146
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,440
Let me try yours, it's good.

147
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,520
Have some beef.

148
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,400
Here, take it.

149
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,160
Melon.

150
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,280
Yuan Song.

151
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,640
I've printed the interior design plan.
I'll explain it upstairs.

152
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,040
Wait!

153
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,160
I have something to tell you.

154
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:56,880
Go ahead.

155
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:03,760
I know that now
is not the right time to say this.

156
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:07,320
You just had a breakup
and haven't recovered yet.

157
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,680
But I must tell you right now.

158
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,320
Last time, I said

159
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,440
that I'd wait for you to break up
and fall in love with me.

160
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:18,000
Back then, I really thought I could wait.

161
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,920
But love came too suddenly

162
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,840
like a tornado.

163
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:28,240
It caught me by surprise.

164
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,760
So you like someone else now.

165
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,880
I think I'm a jerk too.

166
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:42,880
Maybe my family's genes started
to mutate from my generation.

167
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,480
Regardless,

168
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,120
I'm sorry, Yuan Song.

169
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,720
I don't like you anymore.
I can't wait for you anymore.

170
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,480
Forget everything I said before.

171
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,320
I meant them when I said it.

172
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,880
But now, I really don't like you anymore.

173
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,320
I'm really sorry.

174
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,760
Why would you apologize for this?

175
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,280
I have to!

176
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,080
A verbal promise is still a promise.

177
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,880
All right, I understand.

178
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,080
Then, from now on,
we're just good friends.

179
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:18,880
Of course.

180
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,760
Now, let's check out
the wooden floor finish

181
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:25,120
and discuss the interior design
at the cafÃ© across the street.

182
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,240
-Let's go.
-Okay.

183
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,880
Why did you come out of my house?

184
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,240
You must be the owner, Mr. Ye.

185
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:41,320
I'm the new property manager.
I'm here to check the site.

186
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:44,040
No. This is my designer.

187
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,720
Ye Luming is my uncle.
He bought this place for me.

188
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,120
It's still under his name for now.

189
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,520
Uncle? How should I address you?

190
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,760
My name is Cai Minmin.

191
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,440
Hello, Ms. Cai. This is my name card.

192
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:58,720
Don't hesitate to call or message me
if you need anything.

193
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,480
-Thank you.
-I'll get going then.

194
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,560
Melon.

195
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,840
-Ye Luming is your uncle?
-Yes.

196
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:11,080
Someone mentioned him
in the company before.

197
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,760
Maybe they just have the same name.

198
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,320
I don't think so.

199
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,960
It's not surprising to hear his name
from your colleagues.

200
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,920
He owns the ad agency
that's working with your company.

201
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,000
Ad agency?

202
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,680
Haven't I mentioned it to you?

203
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:47,200
Does your aunt mind
that he bought you a house?

204
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,200
Why would she?

205
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,640
Right, I don't have an aunt yet.

206
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,240
Only an aunt-to-be.

207
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:59,360
Aunt-to-be? Your uncle's girlfriend?

208
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,360
I don't think she's his girlfriend yet.

209
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,160
I'm not really sure.

210
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,320
Wait. You're his niece.
Don't you know if he has a girlfriend?

211
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,240
It's actually quite complicated.

212
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:15,360
Maybe it's related to the Ye lineage.

213
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:17,960
Lineage?

214
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,920
A lineage of backups.

215
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,280
Just like me,
he fell in love with a woman,

216
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,960
but she already has a boyfriend.

217
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:27,840
He couldn't let her go,
so he became her friend.

218
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,640
He's trying to steal her away.

219
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,880
My uncle is amazing.
He knows just what to do.

220
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,440
If he wants to charm someone,
no one can resist him.

221
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,320
It's true!

222
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,040
Also, he's very handsome.

223
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,880
So I'll have an aunt sooner or later.

224
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:50,440
On May 20, he even tricked her
into taking a photo to show my mom.

225
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,280
He's handsome, right?

226
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,200
My aunt-to-be is very pretty too, right?

227
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,240
They are such a perfect match.

228
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:04,240
I pity my aunt-to-be's boyfriend.

229
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:08,400
He's so unlucky to have met
an unexpected opponent like my uncle.

230
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,800
You have such an amazing uncle.

231
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,160
Why didn't I know?

232
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:20,400
My uncle isn't the third party.
He didn't destroy their relationship.

233
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:23,480
All thanks to our good lineage,

234
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,840
we have great patience.

235
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,520
Also, we can be very patient
in giving gifts and buying meals.

236
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,760
For example, if he wants
to buy my aunt-to-be jewelry,

237
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:34,080
he'd ask her to choose a gift for someone.

238
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:37,040
She'd choose the one she likes, right?

239
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,960
Then, he'd buy the same necklace
to thank her.

240
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,560
And his purpose is achieved.

241
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,640
Look, this is the same necklace she got.

242
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,760
I have one too.

243
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,320
-It's done.
-Okay.

244
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:53,800
Let's go.

245
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,360
Nice necklace.

246
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,200
Thanks. Let's go.

247
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:14,280
They say you age three years
after a breakup.

248
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,720
But we can't afford
to grow any older at this age.

249
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:20,000
Crying too much makes your face bloat
and eye bags sag.

250
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,800
You can't even afford to cry.

251
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:29,320
I thought I was mentally prepared.

252
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:33,480
I didn't expect
that when it really happened,

253
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,160
the pain I was supposed to bear

254
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,880
didn't reduce at all.

255
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,520
Your mental preparation
was just your pride talking.

256
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,880
You thought you'd be mature
and strong enough

257
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,320
to let it all go.

258
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:49,320
But if you truly liked someone,

259
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,600
it would be impossible for you
to let go so easily.

260
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:58,760
I just don't know what he's thinking.

261
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,520
He kept frowning in front of me.

262
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,720
But he was so happy in front of others.

263
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:08,080
He's even preparing to start dating again.

264
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:12,400
I'm very upset.

265
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:16,280
You were harsh to him,
yet you expect him to be nice to you?

266
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,520
Besides,

267
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:20,640
whether he wants to start dating or not
has nothing to do with you.

268
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,720
You have to find a way
to get over a relationship.

269
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,920
Getting yourself together
and starting to date again

270
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:29,040
beats smoking and drinking.

271
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,560
You're right.

272
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,520
As long as he can have a good life,
I'll be grateful.

273
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,160
Whatever he does

274
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,840
has nothing to do with me.

275
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,600
Since it has turned out this way,

276
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,400
I just need to suck it up.

277
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,600
He's leaving the company soon anyway.

278
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,040
I'm fine

279
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,080
with how things turned out.

280
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,920
Don't you have a suitor?

281
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,160
Just give it a try.

282
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,280
Forget it.

283
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,960
I never thought about dating him.

284
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,640
It's not too late to think about it now.

285
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:20,400
When someone likes you,

286
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,680
you'll feel obliged
to return his feelings.

287
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:25,320
Therefore,
you'll pay more attention to him.

288
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,800
The attention will then
turn into affection.

289
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:30,680
I don't think so.

290
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:33,040
Haven't you told me before?

291
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,000
He has lost a lot of points

292
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:36,720
since he lied to me.

293
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,680
That's true.

294
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,960
But overall,
I give him a pretty high score.

295
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:44,320
He is a nice guy
who is willing to take the lead.

296
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,960
I know you.

297
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,800
By the time you're ready
for your next love,

298
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,320
I think you'd have had your menopause.

299
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:01,200
When you sigh, your life
will be shortened by three seconds.

300
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,480
Great, another three seconds are gone.

301
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,200
Fine.

302
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:21,240
We broke up mainly
because of our own problems.

303
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,760
But that old fox used a lot of tricks

304
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,640
to secretly seduce my girlfriend.

305
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:28,480
Good friends, best friends,
his dog's godmother.

306
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:31,360
I don't know what he did
to impress her parents.

307
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,600
He goes to her house every day.

308
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,200
He pulled so many tricks.

309
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,760
He was obviously waiting for us
to break up and replace me!

310
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,400
Dear,

311
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,520
love is like war.

312
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,120
He has already used three tactics.

313
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,360
Feint, deception, stealth.

314
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:46,320
He's not inexperienced like you.

315
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,000
Close combat is all you know.

316
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,920
How can you fight him with brute force?

317
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,320
My girlfriend is too naive.

318
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,360
She's too gullible.

319
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:56,360
She's your ex,
but you still call her your girlfriend.

320
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,600
Why? You can't let her go?

321
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:00,360
-How can I? I still love her.
-Then get her back!

322
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,880
When we were still together,

323
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,480
she kept rejecting me.

324
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,160
I have my pride too.

325
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:16,520
You'd better let go of your pride
and get her back

326
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,600
before the old fox steals your girl away.

327
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,160
If you want her back
after he has stolen her,

328
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,360
it will be really hard.

329
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,520
I thought you had cut me off.

330
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,240
I wouldn't do that.

331
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,560
We're like family.

332
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:45,920
How can I hate you?

333
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:48,240
Besides, you've already broken up.

334
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:50,800
Once a brother-in-law,

335
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,520
always a brother-in-law.

336
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,600
You want to get beaten up again?

337
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,720
I was just joking.

338
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,640
You brat.

339
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,160
It's for the best.

340
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,040
Now you can study abroad
without any worries.

341
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,240
Who says I'm going?

342
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,600
Why aren't you?
Are you doing this out of spite?

343
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,360
Mourning for your lost love?

344
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,600
Didn't you tell me before?

345
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,200
Breakups and reconciliations are normal.

346
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,360
Why do you think that we won't reconcile?

347
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:19,040
I said breakups are normal.

348
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,520
You want to reconcile?

349
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,400
Please go and memorize
some English vocabs.

350
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,080
When is the TOEFL exam?

351
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,880
I'm not going anyway.

352
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:33,360
Don't tell me you really want
to reconcile with her.

353
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,720
Let's go, Braised Meat! Let's go jogging!

354
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:39,960
Let's go!

355
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,320
Let's go.

356
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:50,760
Let's go.

357
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,520
Mom, I'm back.

358
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,400
Okay. Wash your hands and eat.

359
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:03,440
Okay.

360
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,000
Go.

361
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:17,520
Be good.

362
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,280
You're back.

363
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:22,760
Hey.

364
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,960
Didn't you have a clean breakup
with Yuan Song?

365
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,600
How clean is clean?

366
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:31,040
Don't give him any false hopes.
He gave up on studying abroad.

367
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,360
Did you send the wrong signal

368
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,560
and he thought that you just had a fight?

369
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,240
All right. I'll talk to him.

370
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,440
Canyang!

371
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,400
Help me take this dish outside.

372
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:46,040
Okay, I'm coming!

373
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:53,440
I know I have no right
to interfere with your decision,

374
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:57,720
but I hope you'll reconsider
studying abroad.

375
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,000
Don't be spiteful.

376
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,160
If you decide not to go,

377
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,960
you'll regret it in a couple of years.

378
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,960
You have your whole life ahead of you.

379
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,000
If I say that,

380
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,040
he'll say that I'm meddling
with his business.

381
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,920
But why can't I?

382
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,960
Forget it, he can say whatever he wants.

383
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:02,000
Mr. Ye, your packages are all here.

384
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,040
Okay, you may go.

385
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,280
Su Li, come here for a second.

386
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:12,640
My ear has been itching.
Are there bugs in there?

387
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,480
Nothing's wrong.

388
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,440
Maybe someone's talking about you.

389
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,360
What's there to talk about?

390
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:24,400
Open them and check the quality
of these walking shoes.

391
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:42,120
Mr. Ye, will you stop bulk purchasing?

392
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,800
No one wants to buy anything with you.

393
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:47,720
You bought hundreds of items
just to get the highest discount.

394
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,680
We're an ad agency.

395
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,600
But now, we keep giving out

396
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:55,040
health pots, massagers,
and foot spa basins to our employees.

397
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,720
We're like a nursing home.

398
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,760
What's wrong with caring for our health?

399
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:00,320
When you're over 30,

400
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:04,840
massagers, foot spa basins,
and health pots

401
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,280
will become home necessities.

402
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:09,720
Care for your health while you're young
or you'll regret it later.

403
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:14,640
If you want to please your future in-laws,
why don't you give these to them directly?

404
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,360
You have much to learn.

405
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,400
If I do that,

406
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,320
they have no reason to accept the gifts.

407
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:24,040
However, group buying is different.

408
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:25,560
You can save money,

409
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:28,520
develop common interests
and spend time together.

410
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:32,440
As they say, the process
matters more than the results.

411
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,800
The thought matters more than the gift.

412
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,640
That's true.

413
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:40,080
When my mom bought tissues
at a 60 percent discount,

414
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,440
it was like she hit the jackpot.

415
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,680
Right?

416
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,840
You're size eight, right?

417
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,840
Next time, stop wearing heels
in the office.

418
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,880
No one cares, and you might get bunions.

419
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,600
Luming, I'm size six.

420
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,280
That's not important.

421
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,800
Give a pair to each employee.

422
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,280
Such great employee benefits!

423
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,680
By the way,

424
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:05,160
I have to tell my in-laws about this.

425
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,560
-Take this!
-Here!

426
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:14,600
Take this!

427
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,200
-What do you think? That's yours!
-It's in.

428
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:25,520
What... What do you mean by that?

429
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,240
You...

430
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,440
That works too?

431
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:29,760
Okay, take this.

432
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,080
Good.

433
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,560
Take this!

434
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:35,520
Here.

435
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,520
-Good!
-Nice one.

436
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,040
I know how to smash too.

437
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,120
Come, rest for a bit.

438
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,360
My phone has been ringing nonstop.

439
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,280
Let me see.

440
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:00,160
Luming sent a message saying

441
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,720
that the walking shoes are here.

442
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:03,880
They're here?

443
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:07,600
This Luming guy,

444
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:10,880
what will he group buy with us next?

445
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:14,000
Anything's fine.

446
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,840
If he doesn't do that,

447
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:20,680
he won't have any excuse
to keep coming to our house.

448
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,520
That silly Fanxing.

449
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,280
Why can't she see it?

450
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:29,080
Who puts all their effort
on someone they don't like?

451
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,680
-I mean she...
-Hey.

452
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,880
To be honest, I really don't understand.

453
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,920
Is Fanxing really slow,

454
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:38,880
or is she just faking it?

455
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:44,480
I'll say, our precious daughter

456
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,880
was born with no sense of romance.

457
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:48,920
If she was born with it,

458
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,080
she would already have a boyfriend.

459
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,200
She's so beautiful.

460
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:53,560
She's really slow.

461
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:56,840
You're right.

462
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,840
Why are you agreeing?

463
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:04,160
When I went to the market with Mrs. Wang,

464
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,640
she said to me again,

465
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:08,040
"I want to introduce someone to Fanxing."

466
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,720
She's really nice.

467
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:12,680
She's obsessed with matchmaking.

468
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,720
I gave it a thought.

469
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,840
The men that she knows

470
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,720
must be ugly.

471
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:19,800
That's for sure.

472
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,600
Let me drink some!

473
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:28,120
Li told me

474
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:32,600
that Mrs. Wang and Yuping
had a big argument.

475
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,280
It's because of her matchmaking.

476
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:37,760
-Which Yuping?
-The one in Block Three.

477
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,360
She has a corgi at home.

478
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,360
The one with eyes like...

479
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,520
She keeps asking us about Fanxing.

480
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:49,000
Yuping who has a son who's 165cm tall

481
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:52,320
who wants a daughter-in-law
with the same height?

482
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,080
I remember her.

483
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,080
You said

484
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:02,680
Wang has someone to introduce to Fanxing?

485
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:05,800
Stop. I already told her there's no need.

486
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:09,640
She can.

487
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,120
Show the photos to Fanxing.

488
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:13,960
With some comparison,

489
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,600
she'll surely see who is the best.

490
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,680
You're wise indeed.

491
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,440
Okay, I'll go tell her right now.

492
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,000
Here.

493
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:29,120
Calm down. You're always so rash.

494
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:34,640
Wait.

495
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,560
Why is there a necklace
in the racket cover?

496
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,920
You took Fanxing's racket.
That's definitely hers.

497
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:41,080
Keep it for her.

498
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:44,280
Why is she so clumsy
with such a pretty thing?

499
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,080
-Keep it.
-Seriously.

500
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,920
Don't put it back in.
Put it in your pocket.

501
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:57,360
7:30 P.M. KAYI CAFE

502
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:05,960
Bai.

503
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,360
I'm not going.

504
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,600
After asking her many times,

505
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:17,600
my friend who works at Aijia
as an assistant designer

506
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:21,520
finally agreed to reveal
their company secrets to us.

507
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,720
I invited only a few
trustworthy colleagues.

508
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:30,080
If you have any questions,
you can ask her.

509
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:32,080
This involves our future!

510
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:33,640
Are you busy tonight?

511
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,560
It's not that.

512
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:39,320
I'm planning to quit soon.

513
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,400
What? Quit?

514
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,080
I'm planning to take a break

515
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,520
and visit my uncle in Taiwan
with my parents.

516
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,880
Since your supervisor
has already approved it,

517
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,600
I have no objections.

518
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:55,280
In the next two weeks,
just hand over your projects properly.

519
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:58,200
When you have time, do come and visit us.

520
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,520
Okay. Thank you, Ms. He.

521
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,200
I'll get back to work then.

522
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:07,880
RESIGNATION CERTIFICATE

523
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:12,880
<i>With such low morale,</i>

524
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:19,040
<i>it's already a struggle to survive.</i>

525
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,840
<i>Romance is really a luxury now.</i>

526
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:26,400
My boss is here.

527
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:28,160
So Steven is meeting your boss.

528
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,440
They've probably agreed
on the acquisition cost.

529
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:33,760
Acquisition?

530
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:38,960
Does your friend work for Aijia?

531
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,560
It's the other way around.

532
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:42,960
Aijia belongs to him.

533
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:51,600
Come in.

534
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,760
Send out the documents before leaving.

535
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:06,840
Okay.

536
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,760
Luming, matching that
with your outfit is...

537
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:13,480
Their colors match well, right?

538
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:16,280
And they're perfect for driving.

539
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,160
-I'm leaving.
-Okay.

540
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:31,480
<i>I want to buy you dinner tonight.
Are you free?</i>

541
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,400
I have a date tonight.

542
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:36,920
I'm off.

543
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,040
Darn it.

544
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,560
Keep the shoes for me!

545
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:02,400
Aijia acquired our company two years ago.

546
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:05,200
At that time, I just passed my probation.

547
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:08,280
I originally wanted to work in
a small company for a couple of years,

548
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:11,000
and then apply for a bigger one
when I'm more experienced.

549
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:15,080
Who knew that I'd suddenly become
an employee of Aijia?

550
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:18,280
Did you get a salary increase
after you joined Aijia?

551
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,240
Yes. Take a designer for example.

552
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:22,400
For every positive appraisal,

553
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:25,600
your basic salary and bonus
will increase as well.

554
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:28,920
In our company, if you're a top designer,

555
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,080
you can even get shares and bonuses!

556
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:32,080
That's nice.

557
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,840
They must drive pretty nice cars to work.

558
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:38,840
The big shot designers
in our company hardly drive.

559
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:42,400
Most of them live
in high-end residential areas nearby.

560
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:44,080
It's only a few minutes walk away.

561
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:48,000
Our top designer is still paying off
his house loan.

562
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:52,360
And it's an affordable housing
in the suburbs.

563
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,320
Don't worry.

564
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,440
As long as you aren't eliminated in Aijia,

565
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:59,600
be it designers or salesmen,
you'll have a great future.

566
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:00,920
Eliminated?

567
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,880
Is the office politics intense?

568
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,440
It's not that.

569
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:07,280
Because of the good benefits,
the competition is fierce.

570
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,680
Also, they keep hiring new talents.

571
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,320
When we just moved to Aijia,
we had a hard time getting used to it.

572
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:15,680
Insane systems, strict assessments.

573
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:18,840
Those who couldn't keep up
just quit their job.

574
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:22,240
Money doesn't come that easily.

575
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,440
I can tell that Mr. Luo
from your sales department

576
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:27,960
is a petty person.

577
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,000
I had an issue with him before.

578
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,120
Our company has five sales departments.

579
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:36,440
The probability of you getting into
his department is only 20 percent.

580
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,440
Also, his department

581
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:40,680
has the lowest sales in the company.

582
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:43,040
Even if you get assigned to his team,

583
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,440
he'll look after you if you do well.

584
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:48,880
Who wouldn't want a big fat bonus?
Isn't that right?

585
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:49,920
-Yes.
-Yes.

586
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:51,080
-That's true.
-Hey.

587
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:54,600
But I heard that our big boss is a freak.

588
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:57,760
He's a patronizing fellow.

589
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,280
Not only is he a freak,

590
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,120
that big boss of ours

591
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:05,400
is simply a legend!

592
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,520
I know that Aijia is a great company

593
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:09,920
with a more efficient system.

594
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:13,480
But shouldn't a company be acquired

595
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:17,560
for their branding ideals
and the talents they have?

596
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:21,040
Branding is built by the employees.

597
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,920
It'll be an empty shell after they leave.

598
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:25,360
New wine in an old bottle.

599
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:27,640
I wonder what Mr. Song is thinking.

600
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,160
Does he have too much to spend?

601
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:34,720
You asked me out
just to rant about Steven?

602
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:36,760
No.

603
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,880
I want to ask you about some things.

604
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,600
I knew it.

605
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:44,360
You were avoiding me before.

606
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:46,600
Not anymore.

607
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,840
Because I've forgiven you for lying to me.

608
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:51,200
Really?

609
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:52,720
Why?

610
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:54,480
Because I'm magnanimous.

611
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:59,520
Then be more magnanimous and accept me.

612
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:02,240
I may be magnanimous,
but not to that extent.

613
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,560
Fine. What do you want to know?

614
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:12,880
I don't quite get
how wealthy people think.

615
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:15,360
I want you to enlighten me.

616
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:18,880
Yes.

617
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,080
You're worlds apart from them.

618
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:22,400
That's why

619
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,800
you have such impractical thoughts.

620
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,280
Impractical?

621
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,080
According to my understanding,

622
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:34,320
Steven won't concern himself with things

623
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:36,760
like acquiring small firms
and managing them.

624
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,160
It's a big company.

625
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,760
Everyone has their own responsibilities.

626
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:44,000
The big boss is just in charge
of the company's direction.

627
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:46,920
If they handled everything,
they'd be worn out.

628
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:52,920
But doesn't the boss
make all the decisions?

629
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:55,400
That's for small firms.

630
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,880
You don't know how big companies operate.

631
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:05,000
Hey.

632
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:06,400
Go on.

633
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:10,040
Ask me anything about company operations.

634
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:12,840
Although I don't own a big company,

635
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:14,960
I'm still a boss.

636
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:17,040
I know a lot about operations.

637
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:19,280
That's all.

638
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:20,680
That's all?

639
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:23,160
Think harder.

640
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,760
Then let's talk about how rich men live

641
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,400
in a world that's so far apart from mine.

642
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:41,720
I wonder if all rich people are freaks.

643
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:43,560
Look at his face.

644
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:46,320
It's like his face is paralyzed.

645
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:48,960
He's over 40, but he still looks so young.

646
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:52,600
We suspect that his face is mummified
from too much Botox.

647
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,800
Your big boss had plastic surgery?

648
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:58,440
We all think that the reason

649
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:01,480
he went to Japan with Ms. Wu
on Valentine's Day

650
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,280
was for facelifts!

651
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:04,640
Ms. Wu?

652
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:08,600
Yes, Wu Meiyin
from the investment department.

653
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,120
I think you've met her.

654
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:12,240
What? Wu Meiyin?

655
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:15,320
She's your big boss' lover?

656
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:19,040
They're keeping it a secret.

657
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:24,200
But our colleague accidentally saw
the visa documents Ms. Wu was preparing.

658
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:27,320
Apparently, she's married to our big boss!

659
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:29,960
What? Ms. Wu is married?

660
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:32,480
Of course, they even have a kid.

661
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:33,720
Is it a boy?

662
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:35,000
What type of girls does he like?

663
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:36,120
How old is he?

664
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,200
Does he like older women?

665
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:40,560
Sorry, it's not a boy.

666
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:43,320
They have a daughter
of around eight years old.

667
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,160
As expected, these rich old men

668
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:48,240
like young and beautiful girls.

669
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,080
Hey.

670
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:54,240
Do you think that these big bosses
are empty in their heads?

671
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:58,160
Didn't you see how impressive
Wu Meiyin was in acquiring companies?

672
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:01,240
This is what we call
the affiliation of the fittest.

673
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:03,040
Yes! Affiliation of the fittest.

674
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,760
But that's not the point.

675
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:06,520
We suspect

676
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:10,440
that Ms. Wu and our big boss
lead separate lives.

677
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:12,480
Our big boss

678
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,880
always gets calls late at night

679
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:18,040
to drink at bars and clubs.

680
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:21,480
When Ms. Wu went to Hong Kong,

681
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:24,960
she bought a lot of branded stuff
that young guys would like.

682
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:27,040
We're all guessing

683
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:29,560
she's secretly keeping a boy toy!

684
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:31,400
That makes sense.

685
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:35,760
What kind of woman could live waking up
to a paralyzed man every day?

686
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:41,120
It costs too much
for these rich people to divorce.

687
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:43,280
If their assets were to be divided,

688
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,040
it wouldn't do either of them any good.

689
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,880
So they're likely to lead separate lives.

690
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:54,120
Rich people's lives are too depressing.

691
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,800
Hey, anything else?

692
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:59,600
Tell us more!

693
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:01,880
Yuan Song, you got dumped,

694
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,240
so have some more meat.

695
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,240
Do you know what getting dumped means?

696
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:09,160
I know!

697
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:10,720
The boy behind me, Wang Siqi,

698
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:13,240
wrote me a note saying
that he likes playing with me.

699
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:15,880
But I don't like to play with him,
so he got dumped.

700
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:19,440
Don't just think of playing.

701
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:22,560
You have to study with Wang Siqi,
understand?

702
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:25,600
I know, I'm not a little kid anymore.

703
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:27,720
My mission right now is to study.

704
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:30,880
Yuan Song,
aren't you going to study abroad?

705
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:38,360
Are you really not going to study abroad?

706
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:41,720
I've already decided not to go,

707
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:43,320
but she still left me.

708
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:45,200
She said I was being impulsive.

709
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:48,520
Is it wrong to compromise for love?

710
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:53,920
Your compromise isn't about eating Chinese
cruller or milk bread for breakfast.

711
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:57,440
Rather, it's something
that may derail your entire life.

712
00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:00,600
To her, you're making a huge sacrifice.

713
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:02,480
How long have you two dated?

714
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,560
You gave her too much pressure.

715
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:08,000
She's neither confident
nor prepared to return your feelings.

716
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:10,960
Then what should I do?

717
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:12,720
If I leave, we break up.

718
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:14,680
If I don't, we break up too.

719
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:18,920
Breaking up if you leave
is just your assumption.

720
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:21,760
I'm sure that's what she's thinking.

721
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:25,080
That's the problem between you two.

722
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:27,000
You think that if you go abroad,

723
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:29,280
your feelings will slowly fade.

724
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:31,400
She'll encounter temptations
and have a change of heart.

725
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:35,160
You're not worried about her.
You're just not confident enough.

726
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,240
We really do like each other.

727
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,160
Because of that, we think
we're not worthy of each other.

728
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:47,080
Then you should improve yourself

729
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:48,320
and become better.

730
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:52,120
Studying abroad and dating
don't contradict each other.

731
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:54,840
Only kids would choose one or the other.

732
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,920
Adults find solutions.

733
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:59,640
Don't run away from the problem, solve it.

734
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:01,880
You don't have to choose only one.

735
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:05,520
Young man, you can get both the fish
and the bear paw.

736
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:09,120
My teacher said
we have to protect the bears.

737
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:11,760
-We can't eat bear paws!
-Yes.

738
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:14,200
We definitely can't eat bear paws.

739
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:17,760
If you buy or sell them,
the police will come and get you.

740
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:19,560
