1
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,440
If there's anything you want to say,
just say it.

2
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,320
What?

3
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,080
Well,

4
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,400
when we tried to surprise you
at your house,

5
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,480
that maid...

6
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,080
I mean,

7
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,960
that pretty lady
who we thought was your maid

8
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,920
is your girlfriend, isn't she?

9
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,440
Now you know.

10
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,000
I felt strange

11
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,960
after much thought.

12
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,360
We were so blind.

13
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,640
Was she angry that day?

14
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,960
Did she ask for a breakup or something?

15
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,960
Is that what you want?

16
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:54,880
Yes.

17
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,320
No, I didn't mean that.

18
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,800
I'm the one willing to be your backup.

19
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,800
Backup?

20
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,280
Please don't hate me.

21
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,720
I won't hate you. You're my client.

22
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,880
Clients are everything to us.

23
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,320
How can you say that I'm your client?

24
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:18,080
I'm your junior and dance partner.

25
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,840
I'm your good friend at the very least.

26
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,200
I could be your sister too.

27
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,160
I don't need a sister.

28
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,720
What's your plan
with your girlfriend today?

29
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:42,320
During the day, I have to go to two sites
and buy materials with my client.

30
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:45,400
She needs to work too.
We can only meet at night.

31
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,400
Yuan Song, your bus is here.

32
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,000
Call me if there's anything.

33
00:03:59,040 --> 00:03:59,920
Melon.

34
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,360
You're great.

35
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,080
Don't be a backup or a sister.

36
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:08,360
If you compromise
because he has other choices,

37
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:11,400
you'll hate yourself
when you look back from the future.

38
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,800
<i>In the journey of love,</i>

39
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,240
<i>some are hopeless, looking for a way out.</i>

40
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,720
<i>Some are lost wanderers.</i>

41
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,400
<i>Some has backed off,
no longer moving forward.</i>

42
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:47,080
<i>Some are brave pursuers,
fearless of what lies ahead.</i>

43
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,960
<i>Some are waiting.</i>

44
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,600
<i>While some</i>

45
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,120
<i>are enjoying the flame</i>

46
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,080
<i>before the fire goes out.</i>

47
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,760
A pink cap?

48
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:20,480
You won't wear it anyway.
Let's swap, okay?

49
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,080
Okay.

50
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,800
Cong Xiao, do I look good?

51
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:30,760
Yes.

52
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:35,320
This might be the last time our company
gives out small gifts like today.

53
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Doesn't Aijia have better welfare?

54
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,120
Welfare?

55
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,720
Only Ms. He would prepare

56
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,720
roses, chocolates and mysterious gifts
on a celebration day like this.

57
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,400
We can also leave an hour earlier.

58
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,520
Aijia won't even do anything
for Valentine's Day.

59
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,760
There's only a half-day off
for Women's Day.

60
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,360
That's so stingy!

61
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,680
No, it's not.

62
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,600
It's about the company culture.

63
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,760
Aijia pays a high salary including
a three-month bonus at year-end.

64
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,920
We only have basic insurance.

65
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,560
They have a provident fund,

66
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,320
but we follow family-based management.

67
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,120
I see.

68
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:17,600
Anyway, cherish your last moments
at Amazing Decoration.

69
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,680
Work hard!

70
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,320
Okay.

71
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,720
Bai, you're becoming more like Ms. He.

72
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,680
Of course. Let's get to work.

73
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,800
-Does the cap look nice?
-Yes.

74
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,720
Is he crazy?

75
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,280
Seriously.

76
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,520
What is it now, Ms. Cong?

77
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,160
Our engineer said that
Mr. Qin is looking for me again

78
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,040
as I was the one who dealt with him.

79
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,920
He won't check the house without me.

80
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,360
Is he the guy who texted you at midnight

81
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:55,880
to complain about his relationship
and ask you out for supper?

82
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:59,480
Yes. Who else
if not that disgusting Mr. Qin?

83
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,080
You know what?
He already has a marriage certificate.

84
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,000
Their wedding is in two months.

85
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,320
Does he want to change his wife now?

86
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,360
A few days ago, he said to me,

87
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,320
"My house was designed
according to your preferences."

88
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,080
I'll go with you.

89
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,560
YE LUMING

90
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,280
Do you need anything, Mr. Ye?

91
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,040
<i>I'm downstairs.</i>

92
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,920
<i>Should I go up or will you come down?</i>

93
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:51,240
Don't worry.
Since I'm with you, it'll be fine.

94
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,080
We can make it in time.

95
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,000
Chang Huan.

96
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,400
Wait for me here.

97
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,560
Mr. Ye.

98
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,800
What a coincidence.

99
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:08,840
Are you going out?

100
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,920
Yes, I'm always ready for my client.

101
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,000
Are you waiting for someone?

102
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,200
Yes, I'm waiting for Fanxing.

103
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,320
I need her help.

104
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,040
Let me treat you and Ms. He
to a meal next time.

105
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,160
Sure.

106
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,960
If Fanxing is coming,
let's play pool next time.

107
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,880
-I'm good at that.
-Pool?

108
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,240
Sure.

109
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,920
-Let's set a date sometime.
-Okay.

110
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:34,320
-Bye.
-See you.

111
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,600
He's the boss of Minglu Advertising.

112
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,080
Exactly your cup of tea.

113
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:47,760
Go for it.

114
00:08:58,880 --> 00:08:59,720
Mr. Ye.

115
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,080
We shouldn't do this.

116
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,640
Didn't you want to make up
for the blind date last time?

117
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,360
Are you going back on your word?

118
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:10,840
But...

119
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,440
This...

120
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,720
My wingman, this is urgent.

121
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,440
Look what my sister said.

122
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,800
"You liar! When are you going to get her?

123
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,880
Are you a policeman pursuing a criminal?"

124
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,800
"I tried, but I failed."

125
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:31,160
"Then ask her out for a date.
You can't get her in your office."

126
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,880
"I'll ask her out today."

127
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:36,600
"Fine! Send me a photo of you both today

128
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,000
to ease my mind."

129
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,400
"I'll send it when I get her."

130
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,640
"Send me the photo, or I'll sign you up

131
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:44,440
for <i>If You Are The One</i>,
<i>Love Terminal</i> or <i>Love To Love</i>."

132
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:48,040
My wingman, this is really urgent.

133
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,840
You're just

134
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,240
solving a problem with a lie

135
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,480
and making up another lie.

136
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:03,240
You're dating an intern
behind your family and friends' back.

137
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,800
You don't get to say that to me.

138
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,600
You're right.

139
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:11,440
Do you really want to see me
get rejected on those TV shows?

140
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,400
Fine, let's take the photo then.

141
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,360
Great!

142
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,360
Look, I brought a selfie stick.

143
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,320
No, just take the selfie.
Use your giant phone.

144
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,040
Okay.

145
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,240
The cake too.

146
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,120
No, I looked stern.

147
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,640
-Take another one.
-Okay.

148
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,360
-Is this good?
-This looks fine.

149
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,560
No way, my face looks big.

150
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:46,680
Again.

151
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,320
Enough, let me see.

152
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:57,880
Sure.

153
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,160
This one is okay.

154
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,400
My face looks small.

155
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,360
But my face looks huge.
Can you choose another one?

156
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,520
This one. It can be edited.

157
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:11,520
-Do you know how to edit photos?
-Yes, a little.

158
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,680
Look, there are many options.

159
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:17,360
Press this to adjust the brightness.

160
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,560
Or it will be too bright.

161
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,160
Mr. Qin.

162
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,280
Are you worried even though
a strong male colleague like me is around?

163
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,720
You still came with Cong Xiao.

164
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:57,440
-I was nearby.
-Keep acting.

165
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,160
Cong Xiao.

166
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,880
You've been a great help
these past few months.

167
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,520
Let's have dinner together tonight.

168
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,920
Mr. Qin, you must have forgotten
as you're too busy.

169
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,680
You should stay with your wife tonight.

170
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,400
What about tomorrow?

171
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,640
I'm sorry. I have an appointment tomorrow.

172
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:19,640
Don't worry.

173
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:24,120
Mr. Qin doesn't have the guts to do that.

174
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,840
He'll just look at hot ladies

175
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,520
for his viewing pleasure.

176
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,160
When will you be free then?

177
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,080
Mr. Qin, you may...

178
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,640
You may send me your wedding invitation.

179
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,520
I'll surely attend.

180
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,440
So after this,

181
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,000
if you have any questions
about the maintenance,

182
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,880
you can contact
the engineering department.

183
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,520
Xia, why are you here?

184
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,200
-Cong Xiao!
-What are you doing?

185
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:34,200
How lucky it is to be pretty.

186
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,600
Take your dirty hands off me.

187
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:37,960
What are you trying to do?

188
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,120
Otherwise,

189
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:41,840
I'll send the conversations
between you and her

190
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,880
to your family's group chat.

191
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,960
There's nothing between us.

192
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:48,920
I trust you.

193
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,440
I wanted to slap you,

194
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,240
so that you'd know in advance

195
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:00,040
how it feels to get slapped
by the rightful wife.

196
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,160
Since you've read our conversations,

197
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,360
you must know that
there's nothing between us!

198
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,960
I've been putting up with him for so long.

199
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,040
He's such a shameless guy.

200
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,600
Do you think I'll treasure this scum
like you do?

201
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,160
Do you really think that you're charming?

202
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:32,080
Now you know how annoying you are.

203
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:38,280
Please apologize to me and my colleague.

204
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,680
Do you feel like you're being wronged now?

205
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,000
As a woman, my husband defies me,

206
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,440
but I can only vent my anger.

207
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,800
And you were only chatting with
a troublesome client at midnight.

208
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,120
That's all you did.

209
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,640
So are you not at fault?

210
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,920
What did I do wrong then?

211
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:04,200
He sent you messages at midnight

212
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,800
to complain that
he no longer loves his wife.

213
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,480
He doesn't feel like touching her.

214
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,360
He said he liked your perfume
and asked about the brand,

215
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,240
and that your legs look good
in black stockings.

216
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,080
That's sexual harassment, lady!

217
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,840
But you still chatted with him.

218
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,560
As a salesperson,

219
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,280
you should sell your product, not...

220
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:26,920
Not yourself.

221
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,080
You're right.

222
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,800
He is a shameless guy.

223
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:38,080
Who else would treasure him?

224
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:39,920
People change.

225
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,680
You're no longer the man
I knew in high school.

226
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:43,800
And I...

227
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:48,320
I'm no longer the silly girl
who believes in everything you say.

228
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,640
If you encounter any sexual harassment

229
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,120
or want to get divorced in the future,

230
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,480
call me.

231
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,800
Sir, I'm sorry.

232
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,040
Since you like her so much,

233
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,800
I guess enduring my slap was worth it.

234
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:18,520
Xia.

235
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,480
Xia!

236
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,200
Cong Xiao, are you all right?

237
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,160
It's okay.

238
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,680
It's not that cold under a scarf.

239
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,080
You'll feel better.

240
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,200
It's okay. I can do it.

241
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:10,120
Thanks for taking the slap for me.

242
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,520
Otherwise,

243
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,560
I might not have been able
to get back at her.

244
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:18,880
It's okay.

245
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,000
My skin is tough.

246
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,480
But my heart ached.

247
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,160
I was really touched.

248
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,960
I can't just watch you get slapped.

249
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:46,240
I would have done the same
for other female colleagues.

250
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,120
Stop stirring my feelings.

251
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,440
Qingqing told me secretly

252
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,120
that you would give her a chance.

253
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,240
I can see that she likes you a lot.

254
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,840
-She's kind--
-When did you find out?

255
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,760
-I know that this is your secret with her.
-When did you find out

256
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:28,920
that I liked you?

257
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:36,920
When you beat that florist up.

258
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,600
That long ago?

259
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,560
When we fall for someone,

260
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:54,720
a hierarchy will form.

261
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,000
Unless the other person likes you too.

262
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,440
I'm the one looking up to you.

263
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,920
So you have the right to overlook me.

264
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,280
So don't worry about it.

265
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,040
Chang Huan.

266
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:12,880
You've always been my best friend.

267
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,960
Can't we continue to be close friends?

268
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,320
Only if it wasn't revealed.

269
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,600
But now that you know,

270
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,320
it's impossible.

271
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,880
I looked up to you before this.

272
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,000
Now the cat's out of the bag.

273
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,720
If we continue to be friends,

274
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,680
it's like handing you the knife again.

275
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,560
Letting you hurt me

276
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,520
after allowing you to overlook me.

277
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:02,840
The chance for Qingqing
is also a chance for myself.

278
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,880
If I like someone else,

279
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,360
then you and I will be on the same level.

280
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,080
When that happens,

281
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,080
we can be friends again.

282
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,360
But before that,

283
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:17,240
let's just be colleagues.

284
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:22,240
I was sincere

285
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,920
when I told you to go for it.

286
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:27,680
You're a nice person.
You'll find your happiness.

287
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,520
You too.

288
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,160
I'm going to the site.

289
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,880
Yuan Song is rushing me.

290
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,400
You should go back to the office. Bye.

291
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:15,200
<i>There are two moments
when love leaves the deepest marks.</i>

292
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,200
<i>The moment when love comes</i>

293
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,920
<i>and the moment when love goes.</i>

294
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,160
<i>The latter</i>

295
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:26,000
<i>usually leaves a deeper mark.</i>

296
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:12,640
<i>The moment when love is gone
can be so unforgettable</i>

297
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,600
<i>that it can turn the pinkish moment
when you fell in love</i>

298
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:16,920
<i>to gray.</i>

299
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:21,640
<i>Door opened.</i>

300
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,440
-Are you going out at this hour?
-Yes. Bye.

301
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:25,520
Wait.

302
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,440
What is it?

303
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,840
Give this to Yuan Song tomorrow.

304
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,280
He must be waiting for it.

305
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,000
-Be careful while taking the cab.
-Okay.

306
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,440
Let's eat when we're out, okay?

307
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:02,200
<i>Maybe the moment when love goes</i>

308
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,480
<i>will never come.</i>

309
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:08,080
<i>Or perhaps it'll come in the next second.</i>

310
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,480
<i>In the next second,</i>

311
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,760
<i>without any warning,</i>

312
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,640
<i>it goes away.</i>

313
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:55,560
Why were you peeping at me
from over there?

314
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:58,520
How long were you there?
What was on your mind?

315
00:23:58,840 --> 00:23:59,920
Do you love me even more now?

316
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:04,120
I only peeped at you for a while.

317
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:07,840
I was thinking who this man belonged to.

318
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:08,800
How handsome.

319
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,280
I see. He's mine.

320
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,880
What is he thinking about?

321
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,120
Is he thinking about me?

322
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,240
Does he love me now?

323
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,360
Will he love me in the future?

324
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,160
For how long?

325
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,720
What? I asked the question first.

326
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:29,280
Then, let's not answer the questions.

327
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:32,560
There are no right answers to them anyway.

328
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,120
You're right.

329
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:37,360
Answering about the future now
is equivalent to lying.

330
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,280
Were you busy today?

331
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,400
I waited so long
that my hands turned cold.

332
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:44,360
Feel it.

333
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,040
No, it's not.

334
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,720
Of course not. It's already June.

335
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,400
Silly girl.

336
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:58,760
How about this?

337
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:03,960
It's okay.

338
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:06,440
Didn't you say
only you know about this place?

339
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:14,560
You said you prepared
something special today.

340
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:15,920
What is it?

341
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,080
Come.

342
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,000
Where to?

343
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:58,000
Nowadays, the way old people date
are really disgusting.

344
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,760
They're learning from the movies.

345
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,360
How cheesy.

346
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:05,240
Can't they just buy a cup?

347
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,240
They can do so,

348
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:08,520
but we can't.

349
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,200
This is for our pottery assignment.

350
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:13,320
Why did my mom sign me up for this class?

351
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,600
How irritating.

352
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,400
Maybe the elders think that it's cultured.

353
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:45,080
I think that a handmade gift is the best.

354
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,280
The cups we make together

355
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,720
will remind us of each other
when we drink from them.

356
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:52,720
That's right.

357
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,040
But...

358
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,160
If we continue like this,

359
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,920
we may not be able
to make a cup successfully.

360
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,960
Let's make our own then.

361
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,840
Okay, I'll do it first. Watch me.

362
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,960
We'll post them after the firing.

363
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,280
It'll take roughly half a month.

364
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:34,600
-Thanks.
-Welcome.

365
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,600
Thanks.

366
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:39,480
What's next?

367
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,640
Are we there yet?

368
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,680
Almost.

369
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:52,320
-How much longer?
-Soon. Just a few more steps.

370
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,560
Where are we going exactly?

371
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:57,640
-Are we there yet?
-Yes.

372
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07,040
Enjoying the night view isn't creative.

373
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,160
Spending money will stress you out.

374
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:12,360
But I don't have time
to prepare free surprises.

375
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,640
You found out?

376
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:23,080
Yes, when you filled my fridge.

377
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:27,400
What else did you find out?

378
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,360
I found out that

379
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,920
you are exceptionally pretty today.

380
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:43,200
Why are you laughing? Do I look funny?

381
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,480
Didn't my gaze charm you?

382
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:52,520
The website said that one can charm a girl

383
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,400
when he stares at her eyes very closely.

384
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,120
Stop laughing.

385
00:28:58,360 --> 00:28:59,360
Enough is enough.

386
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,120
-Is it funny?
-That tickles!

387
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,800
Stop it!

388
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,520
Stop!

389
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,360
How I wish

390
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,360
time could stop.

391
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,320
It's so good to be in love.

392
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:40,840
We can make cups happily,

393
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:44,320
watch movies
and enjoy the night view together.

394
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,600
We can also sweet-talk each other.

395
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:52,800
We can also hug each other by the lake.

396
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:57,440
You've realized
all my imaginations about love.

397
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,080
I have no regrets now.

398
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,400
Don't get satisfied so easily.

399
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,800
You must demand a lot from me.

400
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:09,040
Or I'll be very full of myself.

401
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:20,160
Promise me first before I tell you.

402
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:21,880
Okay.

403
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:22,920
I promise.

404
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:27,920
If we break up one day,

405
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,400
you must...

406
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,240
You must curse me with an unhappy life.

407
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:35,400
Curse?

408
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:37,600
Why must I curse you?

409
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,080
Because

410
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:45,720
only those who aren't in love
can wish each other happiness.

411
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:48,440
But if we still loved each other,

412
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,360
we would hope that
the other person feels sad

413
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,960
and regrets breaking up.

414
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,040
You're right.

415
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,520
Did you say break up?

416
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:02,240
You told me to demand.

417
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,680
And I said, in case that happens.

418
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:07,160
But don't make such a strange request.

419
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:08,760
Okay.

420
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,000
I'll stop now.

421
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:13,920
What do you think I've prepared for you?

422
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:21,640
For you.

423
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:24,600
Can I open it now?

424
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,960
Of course. Take a look.

425
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:37,960
Something branded?

426
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,040
It lasts longer.

427
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,080
Why is it not a wallet?

428
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:47,400
I heard that a gifted wallet
must be filled with money.

429
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:55,120
I'll tell you a line
I heard from a gentleman.

430
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:58,320
"Dream on!"

431
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:00,800
I like anything you give.

432
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,120
I'll wear it tomorrow.

433
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:07,680
I'll keep it.

434
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:18,200
So what's the plan
after enjoying this night view?

435
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:21,200
I'm taking you home. It's almost ten.

436
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:25,920
Are you taking me home already?

437
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:30,680
I was thinking of having supper together.

438
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,240
Fine, let's go home then.

439
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:44,560
Fanxing, when did you become so naughty?

440
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:46,920
-What? Let me go.
-You're so naughty now.

441
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:49,280
Hey, you're making me dizzy.

442
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:50,720
-What now?
-Give me a kiss.

443
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:52,720
<i>We can't stop time</i>

444
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:54,240
<i>or turn back time.</i>

445
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:58,920
<i>Even memories will fade and vanish.</i>

446
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:04,160
<i>Only the feeling of happiness
will last forever in your life.</i>

447
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:48,880
<i>I went home.
Good luck with your oral defense.</i>

448
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,920
How much salt did you add?

449
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,200
This is too salty.

450
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,840
Didn't I tell you?

451
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,960
Taste it if you've forgotten
whether you've added salt.

452
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:02,880
I just forgot to taste it.

453
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,240
Calm down!

454
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:08,240
You turned cucumber salad into pickles!

455
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,480
-Morning, Mom, Dad.
-Morning.

456
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:11,880
Morning.

457
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:15,920
Fanxing hasn't returned?

458
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:19,320
No. Song Xue will send her to work.

459
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:23,240
Whenever Song Xue and Dongyang fight,

460
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:25,560
Fanxing is always the peacemaker.

461
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,440
Even your teeth bite your own tongue.

462
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:31,720
Of course, every couple fights.

463
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:36,320
It's a rough exchange of knowledge
with those two.

464
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,480
There must be a judge.

465
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:38,520
I don't care.

466
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:41,960
If they quarrel again,
both of you must stay out of it.

467
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:43,920
I'm fine with that.

468
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,440
Try the pickled cucumber your dad made.

469
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:49,920
Try it.

470
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:54,840
It's tasty!

471
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:32,520
The water hasn't boiled yet.

472
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,440
Leave it. I'll pour it for you.

473
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:37,040
Never mind, I'll do it myself.

474
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,120
I'll come later.

475
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,320
It's okay.

476
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,960
I'm done here. Go ahead.

477
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,000
Cong Xiao!

478
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:02,880
-There's a client.
-Coming.

479
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:33,080
Ms. He, are you busy?

480
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:36,640
It's fine. I'm counting your overtime pay.
What is it?

481
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:39,920
A client is claiming to be your classmate.
She's asking for you.

482
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:43,400
-Who is it?
-Ai Meixiang.

483
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:47,120
-Ai Meixiang?
-Yes.

484
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:50,040
I don't know such a person.

485
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:53,840
We've been classmates for four years,
but you don't even know my name.

486
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:55,600
I'm sorry.

487
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:59,440
Besides being in the same class,
we didn't talk much.

488
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,200
Everyone calls you Amy.

489
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:03,280
We did talk.

490
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:07,880
All the girls hated me back then
because all the guys liked me.

491
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,880
Maybe I was a bit slow.

492
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,760
I forgot to ask for your number last time.

493
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:16,760
But I knew you worked
at Amazing Decoration,

494
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:19,720
so I told my husband's driver
to drive me here.

495
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:24,160
Are you planning to renovate your house?

496
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,600
Yes. My classmate works here,

497
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,760
so I'm not choosing other companies.

498
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,240
You have to give me a discount.
I want at least a 20 percent discount.

499
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:33,800
A 20 percent discount.

500
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:37,120
No way, the market price we set
is not as high.

501
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:38,600
Furthermore,

502
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:40,840
for a client with class like yourself,

503
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:45,440
we must use the eco-friendliest materials
and the best contractors

504
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,760
so that it's worth the money.

505
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:51,120
As a purchasing agent,
you know that good things aren't cheap.

506
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,280
You're right.

507
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,480
Cong Xiao, get me the price list.

508
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:02,640
Okay.

509
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:05,960
Ms. Ai.

510
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:10,520
Explain our new luxury package

511
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:13,720
with free upgraded materials
to my classmate.

512
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:14,960
Ms. He.

513
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:18,040
That package is for the next season.

514
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:19,360
Next season?

515
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,560
Yes. But since she's your classmate,

516
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:25,720
I'll talk to the supervisor.

517
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:27,120
It should be fine.

518
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:28,920
Thanks then.

519
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:32,880
I'll get back to work now, Amy.

520
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:35,520
Talk to the marketing staff
if you have any inquiries.

521
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:38,320
Sure. I'm going to our class rep's
birthday party.

522
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,000
See you then.

523
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:41,720
Sure.

524
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,520
Ms. Ai.

525
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,880
This is our latest price list.

526
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,720
But it's not in here.
This is the upgraded version.

527
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:57,400
I'll explain it to you.

528
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:00,560
What does her boyfriend do?

529
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:01,920
Boyfriend?

530
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,840
She doesn't have a boyfriend.

531
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:05,120
Is that so?

532
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:08,440
She belongs to all the employees.

533
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,280
Next.

534
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,760
Why do the seagulls

535
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,720
-live by the sea?
-Let's sit there.

536
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:20,720
Do you know why?

537
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,000
By the sea?

538
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,040
-I don't know.
-If they lived by the bay,

539
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:27,600
they'd become bagels!

540
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,160
Now, another one.

541
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:38,840
Qingqing is like a wind-up toy
that has been set off.

542
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:40,680
She keeps going after Chang Huan.

543
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:42,480
How cute.

544
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:46,120
When the power is out,
you must shave it as it's dark.

545
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,560
I must go for it too.

546
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:49,920
Ms. He.

547
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:52,640
What does Mr. Ye think of me?

548
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,280
Did he mention me?

549
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,440
He has a good impression of you.

550
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,440
But he doesn't think so about me.

551
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,600
I can't even lift my head up
before him now.

552
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:08,400
I have to talk softly to him
even though I'm being mocked.

553
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:10,080
I'm sorry.

554
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:12,680
Let bygones be bygones.

555
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:17,480
As long as you stop asking me
to make up so-called coincidences.

556
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:18,960
There's no need for that.

557
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:20,920
Just assist me this time!

558
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:23,800
How?

559
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:26,840
Actually, I ran into him downstairs
yesterday.

560
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:28,960
I said I wanted to treat him to a meal.

561
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:31,960
After that, he asked me out
to play pool together.

562
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:34,760
Congratulations.

563
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,200
Can you help me then?

564
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:40,080
How can I help?

565
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:44,160
I told him that
I would treat both of you to a meal.

566
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:48,440
Why must you involve me?

567
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:51,000
Do you want me to be your third wheel?

568
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:54,720
It'll become a date
if it's just the two of us.

569
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,760
We're not close. We'll run out of topics.

570
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:59,040
He'll feel uneasy.

571
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:01,400
A mutual friend should be there.

572
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:04,040
Compliment me in front of him.

573
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:06,680
I can't praise myself, can I?

574
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:12,000
My feelings for him are getting stronger.

575
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:15,120
He has principles and no bad habits.

576
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,240
I'll make him mine.

577
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:19,280
But before that,

578
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,480
I have to make him see me.

579
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:24,760
He doesn't have cataracts.

580
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:26,200
Of course, he can see you.

581
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:28,360
Ms. He!

582
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:30,480
Praise me in front of him.

583
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:33,640
-Tell him that I can cook really well.
-What are you looking at, Chang Huan?

584
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:36,840
-I'm good domestically and socially.
-Nothing.

585
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:39,120
All right, Chang Huan.

586
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:42,080
That temple has answered many prayers.

587
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,320
Let's go there this Saturday.

588
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:46,560
Okay.

589
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,880
Please take a look
at this thermostatic showerhead

590
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,160
imported from Germany.

591
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:54,880
It needs only three seconds
to reach 38 degrees Celsius.

592
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:57,600
It won't burn or freeze your soft skin.

593
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:00,840
The greatest feature is that
it uses three techniques to release water.

594
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:03,960
First, the unique
air injection technology.

595
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:08,480
It helps you relax as if you're showering
under the rain in a forest

596
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:10,200
after a long day at work.

597
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:13,720
Second, the waterfall style.

598
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:17,400
The rushing water hits your shoulders
like a waterfall.

599
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,240
You'll feel refreshed
as if you're being massaged

600
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:26,440
by a professional Thai masseur.

601
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:34,080
Third, the spiral style.

602
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:39,840
It washes off the shower gel efficiently
without harming your skin.

603
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:43,680
We shower every day.

604
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:47,760
We spend about 200 days in the shower
in our whole lives.

605
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:49,560
Even more for those with mysophobia.

606
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:53,040
This shower raises your quality of life

607
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:54,840
and makes showering more fun.

608
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:56,720
Don't miss out.

609
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,080
That's all.

610
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:08,680
Not bad. Ye family members
do have a knack for advertising.

611
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:11,480
Do you want this showerhead?

612
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:16,600
Your mom gave you
200,000 yuan for renovation.

613
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:19,040
Buy it if you have the money.

614
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:22,400
It was enough initially.

615
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:25,920
But it's not enough
to buy this showerhead.

616
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,440
So you're here today...

617
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:34,120
There's a 50 percent discount
for this now.

618
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:36,200
It's a really good deal.

619
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:38,880
How much is it?

620
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:40,160
Not much.

621
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:42,360
Just 45,000 yuan.

622
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:43,440
Get lost!

623
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:45,600
