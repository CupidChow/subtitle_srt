1
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:04,080
Qingfeng, are you listening?

2
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,640
I'm reading it to you.

3
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:10,240
I've always carried my keys with me
since I was young.

4
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,160
I'm used to it.

5
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,840
I disagreed

6
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,400
when Canyang wanted to install
the keyless door lock.

7
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,800
The things left behind by our ancestors

8
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:23,640
are slowly disappearing
and becoming outdated.

9
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,480
That's right.

10
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,880
Do you still remember?

11
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,120
When we just got married,

12
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,680
I wanted a bicycle so bad.

13
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,800
We saved for months

14
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,320
and you bought me
a Phoenix brand bicycle later.

15
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,680
Then we saved for another few months

16
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,120
and got you a Shanghai brand watch.

17
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,960
It's exactly like

18
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,800
how young people nowadays

19
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:55,920
save for months just to buy a bag.

20
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,200
Our golden days

21
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,640
are gone.

22
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,000
They're long gone.

23
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,760
Hello, are you He Fanxing?

24
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,240
-Yes.
-Your delivery.

25
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,600
-Thank you.
-Welcome. Bye.

26
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,040
All right, it's done.

27
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,720
The default password is six zeroes.

28
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:24,440
Reset it according to the manual
and register your fingerprints.

29
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,480
-Okay, thank you.
-You're welcome.

30
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,000
Dad, Mom.

31
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,720
Come and register your fingerprints.

32
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,680
So fast?

33
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,960
-That's right, hurry.
-Come.

34
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,800
Mom, look.
This is a GPS tracking wristband.

35
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,440
No matter where Dad goes,
we'll be able to find him.

36
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,600
He'll never get lost.

37
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,560
So this blinking red dot means that

38
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,760
he's in the residential area now?

39
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:54,880
Yes.

40
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:58,040
This wristband is connected
to my phone and Canyang's.

41
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:01,960
Both of us can check Dad's location
anytime and anywhere.

42
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,840
-By the way, Dad.
-Yes?

43
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,720
It's waterproof.

44
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,160
-You don't have to take it off.
-Is that so?

45
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,280
Good thing I have this.

46
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,000
Your mom was planning
to put Baylor's leash on me.

47
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,840
What are you saying?

48
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,320
This is really good.

49
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,200
-I'll help you put it on.
-I can do it myself.

50
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:24,240
Who is going to help me put it on
when you're not around?

51
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,200
Coming!

52
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,480
-I'll help you fasten it.
-You're home.

53
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,560
We have a keyless door lock now?

54
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:37,440
Yes, register your fingerprints
and connect your phone to the wristband.

55
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:40,080
-Wristband?
-Yes.

56
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,800
-Let me see.
-I got this for Dad.

57
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,200
Goodness.

58
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,040
Twins are truly telepathic.

59
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,000
I bought the same one.

60
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,640
Great. Give it to me.

61
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,720
Your sister said
it can count my steps every day

62
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,280
and check our sleeping quality.

63
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,720
I have one now!

64
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,240
From now on, you won't go missing either.

65
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,400
I'm not worried about getting lost.

66
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,000
I don't have dementia.

67
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,120
I'm the one who has dementia.

68
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,040
Canyang, get the door.

69
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,320
Okay.

70
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,000
Look.

71
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,320
-Look at this.
-Look.

72
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,920
Jiacheng, it's you.

73
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,480
Are your parents home?

74
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,000
-Yes.
-Is Jiacheng here?

75
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,200
Come in.

76
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,040
Did you get off work early today?

77
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,080
Yes, I came to see Mr. He.

78
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,160
Come here.

79
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,920
Mr. He, this is for you.

80
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,920
She asked you out to play badminton
so readily.

81
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,920
She must be up to something.

82
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,560
She is usually quiet

83
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,680
and focused on her job.

84
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,440
She's definitely tough.

85
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:57,880
I know.

86
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,400
She readily agreed to go

87
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,360
to my graduation party before.

88
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,880
When she is easy to talk to
and she simply agrees to things,

89
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,400
then it's over.

90
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,920
You know her very well.

91
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,320
They have a neighbor called Mrs. Wang.

92
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:21,440
Her son dated a girl
who is ten years older than him.

93
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,640
They caused a fuss

94
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,680
for the sake of their love.

95
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,920
His family strongly objected.

96
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:32,080
Mrs. Wang wanted to slit her wrist
and hang herself,

97
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,360
and demanded her son to make a choice.

98
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,520
The relationship was doomed
from the beginning.

99
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,680
He decided to listen to his mom.

100
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,160
He went on a blind date,

101
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,080
married a girl his family liked
and had twins.

102
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,040
He's a happy man now.

103
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:52,040
The human heart has built-in intelligence.

104
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,840
When it encounters conflicts,
it will adjust itself

105
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,560
to adapt to the world.

106
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,680
It will become flexible and positive.

107
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,560
It will justify and convince itself.

108
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:07,560
Without this function,

109
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:11,680
asylums would probably
be everywhere in the world.

110
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:20,480
Actually, He Fanxing is not
as brave as she thinks she is.

111
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:24,080
When she likes someone,
she'll be overly cautious.

112
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,200
She's greedy and timid.

113
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,000
She wants it all.

114
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,080
If you're willing to commit to her,

115
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,080
I believe her family

116
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,760
might not object to it.

117
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,800
What I mean is

118
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,040
I'm one of the people she cares about.

119
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:50,120
I gave up on studying abroad for her
on my own accord.

120
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,760
It was a huge blow to her.

121
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,160
When she likes someone,

122
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,960
she'll protect everything about him,
including his dreams.

123
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,840
She'll try her best
to remove his obstacles

124
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,120
and let him grow freely.

125
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,320
No wonder you can't get over her.

126
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,320
You and your dad are total opposites.

127
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,520
I understood these things
after I broke up with her.

128
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,400
So you still won't back down.

129
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:21,840
In this world,

130
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,560
I suppose you don't always get
what you want.

131
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,400
Now that I think about it,

132
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,880
when we were together,

133
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,760
I never considered her family's feelings.

134
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,720
I blamed her for caring
about other people's opinions.

135
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,520
If we really went public
with our relationship,

136
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,680
it would probably cause chaos too.

137
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:40,840
Our ending

138
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,680
wouldn't have been better
than their neighbor's son.

139
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:48,120
If women are a school for men,

140
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,440
my son can finally graduate.

141
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,080
You're thinking like an adult now.

142
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,880
Do you still want me to get her back?

143
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:55,840
No.

144
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,920
No one can take what's yours
and you can't take what isn't yours.

145
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:02,000
This is probably the conclusion
from the adjustment of the heart.

146
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,840
You learn fast! Cheers.

147
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,040
-Look at these.
-Look.

148
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,640
I think my babies are crying.

149
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,360
I'd better hurry home.

150
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,800
My mom can't do it alone.

151
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,840
Isn't your wife home?

152
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,720
Since I'm home,
I let her go shopping with her friends.

153
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,400
Look.

154
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,280
Jiacheng is such a good husband.

155
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,320
<i>You have really low standards
for a good man.</i>

156
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:34,640
I'll get going.

157
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,400
Mr. He, see you again.

158
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,920
Don't bring so many gifts next time.

159
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,880
-Okay.
-Go.

160
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,240
Drop by when you're free.

161
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,400
Sure.

162
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,720
I'll walk him out.

163
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,760
Fanxing, it's fine.

164
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,360
Jiacheng.

165
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,720
How are things with you and your wife?

166
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,520
We don't fight anymore.

167
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,320
Do you love her?

168
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,280
I do!

169
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,400
I think it's not easy for her.

170
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,160
I'm just a highway tollman.

171
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,760
I'm often away.

172
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,520
She's the one taking care of our kids.

173
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,120
I think if a family

174
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,800
can stay together

175
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,720
with no trials or tribulations,

176
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,040
then that's happiness.

177
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,360
That's good.

178
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:28,760
Go on home.

179
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,520
I'm going, Fanxing. Get inside.

180
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,280
Are you drinking again? Stop!

181
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:52,840
Stop and be good!

182
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:54,800
Stop drinking.

183
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,440
I know you're upset.

184
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,920
Why did you let him drink so much?

185
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,480
You're finally here.

186
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,120
We're happy.

187
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,480
Look at you.

188
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,640
-Drinking can drown your sorrows!
-All right.

189
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,080
Yuan Song!

190
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,280
-Yuan Song!
-Go home!

191
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,800
Your dad is here to take you home.

192
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,000
Let's go.

193
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,520
Be careful.

194
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,960
-Good boy.
-What's...

195
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,760
What's going on with you?

196
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,200
-I'm upset.
-He's upset.

197
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,600
-Okay.
-All right.

198
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,880
Dad's here.

199
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,880
I'll stick up for you. Don't cry.

200
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,120
Come, let's go home.

201
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,400
Hurry!

202
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:35,680
Hurry.

203
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:38,680
Why did you make him drink so much?

204
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,120
Come.

205
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,120
-Put the bill on my tab.
-Okay.

206
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:48,400
<i>This is my first time visiting
and you have a meeting?</i>

207
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,120
<i>Isn't that rude?</i>

208
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,040
<i>Don't you know your priorities?</i>

209
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,440
All right, just two hours.

210
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:56,560
Hurry.

211
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,920
NATURAL BEAUTY SPA FLAGSHIP STORE

212
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:02,240
Lily, should we go now?

213
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,720
It's nearby.
It won't take long to get there.

214
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Caiwei, check the gifts again.

215
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,840
Do you think these gifts are appropriate?

216
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:13,600
-I think it's a bit--
-Too little?

217
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:18,480
Prepare two more cards and add
the NB1 Ultimate Restoration Facial.

218
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,240
MEMBERSHIP CARD

219
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,000
Here.

220
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:26,040
Didn't you ask Luming
to give them this last time?

221
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,040
I've opened over ten spa salons.

222
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,880
This is our best lifting
and anti-aging treatment.

223
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,320
Look at my skin. I just had a facial.

224
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,240
Not bad, right?

225
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,520
Give two more to Fanxing's mom.
More gifts are always better.

226
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,600
Caiwei, you're going overboard.

227
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,880
You don't even need this many gifts
for a marriage proposal.

228
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,000
What can I do?

229
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:47,400
Luming is 37 years old
and still unmarried.

230
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,880
He finally found someone.

231
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:51,320
I have to find a way to help him.

232
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,960
-Let's go.
-You two are truly a family.

233
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,240
Fanxing, if one hand
isn't strong enough, use two.

234
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,200
Canyang, wipe that corner!

235
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,760
You're tall. Don't waste your height.

236
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:15,440
Hurry, the guests will be here soon!

237
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,480
-Baylor!
-Baylor!

238
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,440
He Canyang, why did you let it out?

239
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:22,960
I just mopped there!

240
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:23,960
He Canyang!

241
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,920
Why didn't you shut the door?

242
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:30,880
You...

243
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:33,520
Canyang! Keep the dog at your place!

244
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,680
Take it away!

245
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:36,800
Hongmei.

246
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,200
Hongmei!

247
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,400
Where is the starter

248
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,400
for my shaver?

249
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,520
What starter?

250
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,640
It's called a charger!

251
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:50,040
It's in the second drawer behind you!

252
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:05,080
Qingfeng, you can't wear
the collar this way.

253
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,480
Put it down.

254
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,080
My dear daughter.

255
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:12,800
Go and change. Do your makeup.
Don't just lay here.

256
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,200
-Hurry.
-Why should I...

257
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,640
You look too formal!

258
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,040
They're coming to see Dad.

259
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,640
They're not only here to see your dad.

260
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,160
They're coming to check
their future in-laws.

261
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,320
-Dressing up and putting on makeup
-She's right.

262
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,440
is a sign of courtesy.

263
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:27,760
-Listen to your mom.
-Mom!

264
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,280
-Get changed.
-Hurry!

265
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,280
Gosh, this kid.

266
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,960
No, don't.

267
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,400
-Like this.
-Where's Canyang?

268
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:36,600
Canyang is...

269
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,200
I asked him to buy two bottles of wine.

270
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:40,920
What for?

271
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,240
Aren't they going to eat with us later?

272
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:02,840
Coming!

273
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,800
Caiwei and Su Li, come in.

274
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,640
-Hi, Mr. and Mrs. He. I'm Ye Caiwei.
-Welcome.

275
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,920
-You brought so much stuff.
-These are for you.

276
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,200
Fanxing, help them.

277
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:14,680
Here, give me some.

278
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,800
Let me introduce you.
This is my cousin, Su Li.

279
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,840
-Hi, Mr. and Mrs. He.
-Nice to meet you.

280
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,760
Don't just stand here.

281
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,320
-Please come in.
-Yes, please come in.

282
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:33,880
We were so busy back then
that our heads were spinning.

283
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,480
Luming was in college then.

284
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,680
When holidays started,
he'd take care of Minmin.

285
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,800
Minmin should be about

286
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,960
around three years old at that time.

287
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,080
Was she very playful?

288
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,120
Luming is very thoughtful and creative.

289
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,720
He made Minmin so happy every day.

290
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,960
Minmin is now closer to her uncle
than to me.

291
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:59,080
It wasn't easy for you back then.

292
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,320
It wasn't easy.

293
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:01,800
That's right.

294
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04,320
Luming is 37 years old now,

295
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,000
but he is still unmarried.

296
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,400
As for me,

297
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:09,560
I'm in my 40s and I'm turning 50 soon.

298
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:12,800
I'm not that much younger than you.

299
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,400
Gosh.

300
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:18,560
Although I care for him very much
as a sister,

301
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:21,560
it's better to have a woman
who loves him by his side.

302
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,880
They can look after each other.

303
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,360
You're right.

304
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,360
But Luming is a good catch.

305
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,720
Finding someone should be easy for him.

306
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:38,280
There are many girls who are compatible
with him based on credentials,

307
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,920
but it's not easy to find
someone compatible

308
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,440
that he likes as well.

309
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,960
Good thing he didn't find anyone.

310
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,920
He was waiting for Fanxing.

311
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,440
Well,

312
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:56,360
we're glad to see them together.

313
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:59,320
We also like Luming very much.

314
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,200
But they just started dating.

315
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,520
It's just for a short while.

316
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:07,280
Give them more time
to get to know each other.

317
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,840
As parents, we can't be too anxious.

318
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:12,480
Marriage is not a mission
you need to complete.

319
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,560
-Am I right?
-That's right.

320
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,480
Let them make

321
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,880
-their own decisions.
-Yes.

322
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:20,840
That's right. I do agree.

323
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:24,200
It'll take more than a year to renovate
the house if they want to get married.

324
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,640
They can date

325
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,640
for a year or so.

326
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:29,400
They can enjoy their time alone.

327
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,640
Once they get married and have kids,

328
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:34,560
it won't be easy to go out on dates.

329
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,240
My throat is a bit dry.

330
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,320
Have some water.

331
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,240
-Have some water.
-All right.

332
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,680
Listen to her.

333
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:59,400
No wonder Luming could have
his own business.

334
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,480
His sister is a good talker.

335
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,960
This is called heredity.

336
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:08,960
If his sister was born 40 years earlier,

337
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,640
she'd have been a very popular matchmaker.

338
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,440
Everything she said was on point.

339
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:14,880
What point?

340
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,120
Since she walked in,

341
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,120
she never spoke any nonsense.

342
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,360
She said,

343
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,400
"Luming took care of his niece

344
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,200
since he was in college."

345
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:30,920
Doesn't that imply that he'll be very nice
to his wife and daughter in the future?

346
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,560
She said he's 37.

347
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,440
She hopes he can get married soon.

348
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,600
It'll take a year to renovate the house,

349
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,240
so you can date for a year.

350
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,280
And then get married and have kids.

351
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:44,720
She's so good.

352
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,160
You got so much information from that?

353
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,160
I just heard her praising me.

354
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:53,640
Hey.

355
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:56,120
Be honest with me.

356
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,680
Why did you agree

357
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,080
to let Caiwei visit us?

358
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:01,960
It's nothing.

359
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,440
She wanted to visit Dad.

360
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,720
Could I refuse?
My colleagues wanted to come too.

361
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:10,040
Isn't this the same
as meeting each other's parents?

362
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,320
Are you hiding something from me?

363
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,360
Look at my eyes.

364
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:22,920
Something's up.

365
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:24,400
What's up?

366
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,600
Mom.

367
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,520
What are you thinking?

368
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,160
Can you get pregnant from holding hands?

369
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,040
No, definitely not.

370
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,720
Look at you.

371
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:47,280
Are you shy with your mom?

372
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,080
You can just say no.

373
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,600
But I just think that

374
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:53,840
you're being very strange.

375
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,040
Hongmei, let me help.

376
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,560
Don't treat me as a guest.

377
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:00,880
We're fine.

378
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,200
You're just in time.

379
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:05,400
I need to go to the toilet.

380
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:08,160
Come and help me shell the peas.

381
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,480
-Come.
-No problem.

382
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,120
Hello.

383
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,720
Please move your car.
This is a private spot.

384
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,200
All right.

385
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,400
-Luming.
-Why are you here?

386
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,480
Park in the basement and go upstairs.

387
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,880
I'm waiting for the owner of the car
that's in my spot.

388
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,480
It's my cousin's car.

389
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:00,040
I had a meeting,
so she drove my sister here.

390
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:02,840
-I'll call her.
-It's fine. It's your cousin's car?

391
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,280
Never mind. I'll call her.

392
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,160
-Do you have her number?
-Yes.

393
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,480
-I just called her.
-Luming, is your meeting over?

394
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,360
Wait a minute. I'll move my car first.

395
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,560
It's all right, there's no need.

396
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,440
It's you.

397
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:17,800
Have you met him before?

398
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,640
He's Minmin's boyfriend.

399
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:21,520
Do you remember me?

400
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,480
We met at the super spicy hotpot place.

401
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,720
I'm Minmin's aunt.

402
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:31,280
Luming, have you known
Minmin's boyfriend for a long time?

403
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:48,240
You dad seems a lot better now.

404
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,960
What are your plans for him?

405
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,200
My mom doesn't work.

406
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,840
I'm planning to open a shop.

407
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,920
Then I can have a flexible schedule.

408
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,400
My brother has summer and winter holidays.

409
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,680
We'll be able
to take good care of our dad.

410
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,760
Tell me honestly.

411
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,840
What do you think about Luming?

412
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:12,960
Well...

413
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,720
He likes to play tricks

414
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,080
and beat around the bush.

415
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,400
Other than that,

416
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,280
he's perfect.

417
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,480
Tell him to change if it bothers you.

418
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,520
Restrain him. Don't indulge him.

419
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,480
Caiwei, don't worry.

420
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,960
I know what you mean.

421
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:34,600
Luming and I are dating
with marriage in mind.

422
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:37,200
That's right!

423
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,120
Set marriage as your target.

424
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:42,560
You must have a goal in whatever you do.

425
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,160
It's like taking a cab.

426
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:47,200
You can't ask the driver
to just go around the city.

427
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,040
Yes.

428
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,600
Luming, you're here.

429
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:54,760
-Here.
-Here.

430
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,560
-Have some braised meat.
-You'll like this.

431
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,160
-Have a shrimp.
-I'll help myself.

432
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,360
-Thank you.
-Have some braised meat.

433
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,120
Hongmei, you and Mr. He are great cooks.

434
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:06,720
No wonder Luming always eats here.

435
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,560
Gosh, not just Luming.

436
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,320
Minmin has been here twice.

437
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:11,880
Really?

438
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:16,480
Why did you stop eating?

439
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,840
-Go on.
-Go on.

440
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,960
Minmin loves to eat.

441
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,640
She goes wherever there is good food.

442
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:27,920
But Luming, you should have come alone.

443
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,600
Why did you bring your niece along?

444
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,920
Luming didn't bring her.

445
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,520
Canyang brought her here.

446
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:36,960
Minmin is Canyang's student.

447
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:39,640
Luming mentioned it before.

448
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:42,080
Canyang is a professor
at Minmin's school, right?

449
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,400
I taught her an elective subject.
The class has ended.

450
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,040
I'm going to the art institute
next semester.

451
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,360
I'm no longer her teacher.

452
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:49,280
Don't say that.

453
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,400
As they say, "A teacher for a day
is a father forever."

454
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,600
She must have many fathers then.

455
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:13,120
Sorry, I have chronic pharyngitis.

456
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:17,840
I have a lozenge that is very effective.

457
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,360
I'll give you some later.

458
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:21,040
Thank you, Mrs. He.

459
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:22,840
Dig in.

460
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,120
What?

461
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,800
What's going on with you,
Luming and Su Li?

462
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:36,640
Nothing.

463
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,440
Why?

464
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,800
Has your secret love been exposed?

465
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:54,680
The walls have ears.

466
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,160
Yuan Song and I

467
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,240
kept our relationship top secret.

468
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,920
But apart from Dad and Mom,

469
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,800
my friends, colleagues,

470
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,200
and even others know about it now.

471
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,360
When did you find out?

472
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:13,320
When you told me you ran into Minmin
at the hotpot place,

473
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,520
I already knew.

474
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,080
Every time you lie to me,

475
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,960
you scratch like a gorilla.

476
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,160
Please hide it well
if you don't want me to know.

477
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,680
We're twins indeed.

478
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,320
My chest itches when I lie to you.

479
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,920
It's a physiological response.

480
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,600
When will you break up?

481
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,080
Why would we break up?

482
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,240
I'll teach at the art institute
next semester.

483
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:43,640
We're dating both the uncle and the niece.

484
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:44,760
Do you think that's okay?

485
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,840
No. You break up with him then.

486
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:49,160
We're doing good. Why should we break up?

487
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:51,280
You won't last more than
six months anyway.

488
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,720
You're the one to talk.

489
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,680
Did you and Yuan Song
last over three months?

490
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:57,000
Talk to me when you
and Ye Luming can do so!

491
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,080
You can't say that.

492
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:02,160
I'm dating him with marriage in mind.

493
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,400
All right, good luck then.

494
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:06,400
I'll break up if you get married.
What do you think?

495
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:08,840
Deal!

496
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,680
How could you agree to such a thing?

497
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,960
My uncle is 37.
He wants to get married so badly.

498
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,920
He even dreams of marrying your sister!

499
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:29,720
I'm used to fighting with Fanxing.
I didn't want to lose to her.

500
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,000
What do we do now?

501
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:32,360
Stay positive.

502
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,240
Our chances of breaking up are high.

503
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:55,480
We're here. Remember to ask your husband
to pick you up in an hour.

504
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:56,880
Okay.

505
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:00,280
It's a good thing
that Fanxing wants to get married.

506
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:02,160
Really?

507
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,080
Do I look like I'm lying?

508
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,560
She told me that herself.

509
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,240
Considering her dad's situation,

510
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,920
she'll want to get married earlier
to make him feel at ease.

511
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:11,600
In this regard,

512
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,120
women are really more mature than men.

513
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,360
That's right.

514
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,520
Why don't you plan your marriage proposal?

515
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,560
Girls really like that.

516
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:24,360
Many high-end wedding planners
offer proposal planning.

517
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:28,160
Remember to ask your husband
to pick you up in an hour.

518
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,840
I'm talking about your marriage proposal.

519
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,120
All right. I get it.

520
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:33,600
Be serious.

521
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,200
-I know. Okay.
-I'm off.

522
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,400
By the way,

523
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,560
it's Minmin's dad's birthday next week.
Come back early with her.

524
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:40,600
Okay.

525
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,400
-Drive safely.
-Okay.

526
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,520
Why didn't you change into slippers?

527
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:36,320
Where are you taking
your suitcase at this hour?

528
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,720
I'm not staying here anymore!

529
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:39,640
Where are you staying then?

530
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:44,120
I haven't even dealt with you yet.
You're acting out first?

531
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:47,000
You want to move to He Canyang's place?

532
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,440
Why did you ask him to break up with me?

533
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:53,520
I have to back down just because
you're dating He Fanxing?

534
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:56,680
As your uncle, what's wrong with doing so?

535
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,120
You know it won't last.

536
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,000
Why make it more complicated?

537
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:05,040
I didn't tell you
precisely because it is complicated!

538
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,040
Can't we just live our own lives?

539
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,440
I don't care if you're 37 or 73.

540
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,880
Whether you'll marry her or break up,

541
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,200
that's in the future!

542
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,960
Of course I know first love
probably won't last.

543
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:17,480
But I'm in love with him now.

544
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:18,800
I don't care!

545
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:22,960
-Where are you going?
-To Zhanni's place.

546
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,640
Do you think this will solve the problem?

547
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,440
I don't see any problem to be solved.

548
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:30,000
But you're irritated with me now,
aren't you?

549
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:32,680
Move aside.

550
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:00,960
Enough.

551
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:04,200
I can't catch up with you kids.

552
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:08,120
I'm exhausted.

553
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,640
Do you remember the first time we played?

554
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,480
We had a rally of over 20 shots.

555
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:17,800
That was so nice,
but it feels like you want to kill me now.

556
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:21,040
How is that the same?

557
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,760
I didn't want to hurt your ego back then.

558
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,880
I play well too, okay?

559
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,080
Yes, you're incredible.

560
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:34,440
Why don't I buy you an ice cream
as a reward?

561
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:36,640
I'll go and buy it.

562
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,320
You're obviously craving for it yourself.

563
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:44,520
Here you go.

564
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:48,480
-This homemade ice cream is--
-Is made from whipped cream.

565
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:49,800
So it's very tasty.

566
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,000
You always say the same thing.

567
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,320
When you're old, will you have dementia?

568
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,360
Do you want me to hit you
until you have dementia right now?

569
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:03,520
I'm very sensitive to that word lately.

570
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,560
Don't mess with me.

571
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:12,480
Do I look sexy?

572
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,160
We haven't sat together like this
for a long time.

573
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:30,680
That's right.

574
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,280
After your dad went missing,

575
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,240
I can miraculously understand you now.

576
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:38,880
Understand what?

577
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,840
In love, you're cowardly,

578
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:45,720
hesitant and self-contradictory.

579
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:53,760
It would be amazing
to be a part of your family.

580
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,040
I like you more when I think of this.

581
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,160
Again?

582
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:03,000
Well,

583
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:05,400
I can't stop loving you now.

584
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:07,280
But I've decided to let you go.

585
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:11,360
I'm going to study abroad next May
and study architecture for two years.

586
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:14,280
I'll meet many pretty girls every day.

587
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,080
Maybe I'll feel lonely

588
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,240
and fall for someone else soon.

589
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,440
Let's wait until you get admitted
to school first.

590
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:28,560
What about you?

591
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,120
What are your plans?

592
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:31,920
Me?

593
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:37,680
Open a flower shop with my best friend,

594
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:40,640
take care of my dad and treat his illness.

595
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:44,320
Also, spend more time with Ye Luming.

596
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,080
Learn more about his good points.

597
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,640
Commit to this relationship
wholeheartedly.

598
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:51,640
I can do anything
as long as I set my mind to it.

599
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,880
Working hard on something like this
sounds pathetic.

600
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,240
Isn't love a hormonal reaction?

601
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:02,000
What if you never had that reaction?

602
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:03,960
That won't happen.

603
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,280
Don't you see it on television?

604
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:09,040
There are people
who have been friends for ten years

605
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,280
before becoming lovers.

606
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,880
They liked each other from the start,

607
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:15,480
but they were worried that
it'd ruin their friendship

608
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,280
and kept their feelings bottled up.

609
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:18,600
I see.

610
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:21,200
-All right.
-All right?

611
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,240
I'll try my very best

612
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,320
to break that bottle then.

613
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,560
What?

614
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,560
You're like this thing.

615
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,480
A kind of hybrid between
a horse and a donkey.

616
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,840
It's called a mule. Do you know that?

617
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,280
Are you calling me stubborn?

618
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,120
One more round?

619
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:46,840
Bring it on!

620
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:48,840
-I'll crush you!
-I'll tire you out!

621
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,600
You never have the time
when I want to meet up.

622
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:11,280
Why ask me out for a drink
at noon so suddenly?

623
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,720
I won't drink. I'll just eat.

624
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,200
I have a meeting later.

625
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:27,680
Is something up?

626
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,520
Name the price.

627
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:34,320
I want you to leave
my son's ex-girlfriend.

628
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:40,200
How about this?

629
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:42,480
I'll increase the contract price
next quarter.

630
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,320
Or I'll give you my company's shares.

631
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,840
What else do you want? Just tell me.

632
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,400
What is so funny?

633
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:02,520
I never expected

634
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:05,440
to hear these things from you.

635
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,280
Tell me if you accept it.

636
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,880
Do you think you're in a drama
from the nineties?

637
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,200
Of course, I won't accept it.

638
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:20,520
Isn't this how family dramas go?

639
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:25,000
Have you ever seen
any female leads taking the money?

640
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,000
I thought you were different.

641
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,840
The gender is different.

642
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,680
But deep down,
I do want to be the female lead.

643
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:38,160
So you won't take my offer then.

644
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:44,400
I can understand
that you want to be a good dad.

645
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,280
But there's no room for negotiation.

646
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,520
You stole my son's girlfriend

647
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,360
and now you're leaving no room
for any discussion?

648
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:52,480
Wait. Let me clarify.

649
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,000
I didn't steal her.

650
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:55,800
At most,

651
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,160
I only cared about her.

652
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,200
Didn't you encourage me before?

653
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,880
You can't have double standards.

654
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:08,400
All right.

655
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:13,080
Speaking of relationships,
I'm responsible as well.

656
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,160
How about this?

657
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:16,160
I'll give you a toast.

658
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:18,840
Drink up and consider this over.

659
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:30,400
Okay. If that's the case,
we can't be friends anymore.

660
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,440
We're done.

661
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,120
Done?

662
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,920
You want to end our friendship
because of this?

663
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:40,360
Whenever I see you,

664
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,480
I'll think of the dumb things I did.

665
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:45,160
I feel that I've done my son wrong.

666
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,440
I was an accomplice.

667
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,600
It's not that serious.

668
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:51,480
Fine. May the best man win then.

669
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:54,200
What do you mean by that?

670
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Work-wise, the advertising manager
will liaise with you.

671
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:00,600
There will be no need for us to meet.

672
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:03,320
We'll have nothing to do with each other.

673
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:06,600
When we meet again, you'll be my enemy.

674
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,960
You said there's no need to meet,

675
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:11,840
but I'll be your enemy if we meet.

676
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,760
So are we meeting or not?

677
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,560
Can we still drink together in the future?

678
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:19,920
Steven.

679
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,840
Don't call me that anymore.

680
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,680
We're not that close.

681
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:30,520
If you ever mention me,
do call me Mr. Song.

682
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,840
CONFINEMENT CENTER

683
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:54,640
You broke up with Dongyang
and moved to the school dorm.

684
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,000
Have you gone nuts?

685
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:00,560
I need time to find a place, right?

686
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:01,520
Right?

687
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:05,120
Are you nuts to break up with Dongyang?

688
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:06,600
Hey.

689
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,160
Have you ever asked him
about his thoughts?

690
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:10,880
You're so bossy!

691
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:16,240
Why is having a little baby
so troublesome?

692
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,360
Of course.

693
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:20,880
He has to have a mom, a dad,

694
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:22,440
and be in a household registry.

695
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:24,160
Why divorce then?

696
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,400
Just stay married.

697
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:28,000
Am I the same?

698
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,200
I got a divorce.

699
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,680
I'll find a good dad for Peanut and Malty.

700
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:34,320
He'll be gentle and family-oriented.

701
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:36,360
And he'll take them
to Disneyland every day.

702
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:41,400
What do you think if I name my baby Rice?

703
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:43,120
Everyone in the family is a crop.

704
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,600
I'm talking about you.

705
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:46,160
Get serious.

706
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,200
Well,

707
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:53,680
shouldn't your baby be named Tiantian?

708
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:57,560
Someone's glowing after her resignation.

709
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,640
Tell me. Who did you play badminton with?

710
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:02,600
Mr. Ye definitely doesn't have the time.

711
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,640
My ex-boyfriend.

712
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:13,440
You two really worry me.

713
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:15,160
Why worry?

714
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:17,640
-What's up with Professor Song?
-She was lecturing me.

715
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:21,440
She said a child should have parents
and be in a household registry.

716
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,320
That's true.

717
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,840
How about this? Marry He Canyang.

718
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:29,200
This way, the baby will be
in our household registry.

719
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:32,080
If you marry him, my mom will be thrilled!

720
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:33,240
Hold your horses.

721
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:35,560
Don't say it like it's going to be a fact.

722
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:41,560
It's Dongyang.

723
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:44,080
Should I answer?

724
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,280
No.

725
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:50,680
Forget it.

726
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:54,160
You've been together
for over ten years, right?

727
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,000
That has never changed.

728
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,520
It's good that you're on a break.

729
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,120
Maybe you'll grow fonder of each other.

730
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:04,760
I meant it when I broke up with him.

731
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:07,800
Did you not hope for him
to ask you to stay?

732
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:10,800
See?

733
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:14,440
The essence of love is torture.

734
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:17,800
Even if he can leave you readily,
can you do the same?

735
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:19,480
Reflect on yourself.

736
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:22,640
Don't be pretentious
just because he loves you.

737
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:25,040
Dongyang is your baby's dad.

738
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:27,680
You don't even want to let him know.

739
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,440
This is ridiculous.

740
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:31,400
After you've decided to get a divorce,

741
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:34,040
you've become a changed person.

742
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,320
The bossy lady is back.

743
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:39,080
There are only women who play dumb,

744
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:40,680
never women who are really dumb.

745
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:46,400
Fanxing, you're the same.

746
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:48,640
You and Mr. Ye

747
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:51,040
have met each other's parents already.

748
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:53,440
You're moving so fast.

749
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:54,600
Are you going to marry him?

750
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:56,800
Yes.

751
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:59,400
I want to get married.

752
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:02,720
So everything is all set,

753
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,000
except Fanxing's feelings for him?

754
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:08,560
I'm working on it.

755
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:09,880
Let me tell you.

756
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:14,600
I have

757
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:16,400
a journal.

758
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:20,480
I write down our daily progress

759
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:23,480
and methods to develop our relationship.

760
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:25,560
Here.

761
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,880
"Ways to cultivate relationships.

762
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,840
Cook together and chat.

763
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:34,120
Thoughts.

764
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:36,960
A great cook, very considerate.

765
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:39,920
Likes fish, especially saltwater fish.

766
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,440
Doesn't like eggplant.

767
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:42,440
Summary.

768
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,840
Had a great time eating and chatting,

769
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:48,680
but I didn't feel my heart race."

770
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:52,320
What do you think?

771
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:55,000
Any good suggestions?

772
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:58,160
I asked him to go to a movie tonight.

773
00:41:58,800 --> 00:41:59,880
A romantic movie.

774
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:02,680
Why do I find this

775
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:05,800
very pathetic?

776
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:12,200
In today's pity party,

777
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:14,720
you're the champion.

778
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:17,800
You win.

779
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:19,080
You're the champion.

780
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:21,280
You're the champion.

781
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:24,600
You're the champion.

782
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:26,760
