1
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,040
Are you going out?

2
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,360
I'm meeting a client to review the draft.

3
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,080
Well, good luck then.

4
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:27,840
What are you looking at?

5
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,520
Those two.

6
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,280
Do you have any new gossip?

7
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,920
Cong Xiao promised
to be Qingqing's wingwoman.

8
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,160
So,

9
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:44,320
she's going out with Chang Huan
and Qingqing this weekend.

10
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,240
That's good.

11
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,520
Chang Huan has an admirer like Qingqing.

12
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,080
They'll be together eventually.

13
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,120
Coffee?

14
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,520
But Ms. He,

15
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,840
don't you think that

16
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,560
Chang Huan is attracted to Cong Xiao?

17
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:08,360
It's meaningless if the love isn't mutual.

18
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:09,800
Agreed.

19
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,800
Cong Xiao aims to marry a CEO.

20
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:15,680
Well,

21
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,880
everyone seems to be living a good life.

22
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,200
You and Yuan Song are getting along too.

23
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:22,840
<i>Invasion!</i>

24
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:23,840
<i>DEFCON 1 alert!</i>

25
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:25,960
I think

26
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,760
we're just like normal colleagues.

27
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:30,800
It's different!

28
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,200
Aren't you guys getting closer now?

29
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,280
He doesnâ€™t seem to be giving you
a hard time anymore.

30
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,120
<i>Crisis over.</i>

31
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,680
He looks

32
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:44,160
happy and blissful recently.

33
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,160
Is he in love?

34
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,280
He must be meeting up

35
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,080
with that lovely junior today.

36
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,040
Young romance is always great.

37
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,280
<i>Junior?</i>

38
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,360
<i>The girl who confessed to him?</i>

39
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,120
GREAT CRISIS

40
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,640
If you're not satisfied,
I can make amendments.

41
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,560
The interior design is just a reference.

42
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,120
It can be changed to suit your liking.

43
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,520
It's fine. I'm quite satisfied.

44
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,880
If everything's fine, I'll head back

45
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:23,760
and discuss with the contractors
on the construction date.

46
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,560
All right.

47
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,120
Nice necklace.

48
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,160
It looks nice, right?
My uncle bought it for me.

49
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:40,160
My girlfriend had one, but she lost it.

50
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:41,800
Yuan Song.

51
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,760
I have a question for you.

52
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,320
What does Professor He like?

53
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,960
Are you buying him a gift?

54
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,040
He helped me a lot.

55
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,680
I want to thank him.

56
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,080
In that case, just don't skip his classes.

57
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,240
Even if that's the case,

58
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,680
I still feel bad
for my disrespectful attitude previously.

59
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,760
I even put glue on his chair.

60
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,240
Don't worry. He won't hold any grudges.

61
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,520
If you insist, treat him to a meal then.

62
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,640
Okay, I'm leaving.

63
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:19,720
Bye.

64
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:28,960
I got it!

65
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,480
You forgot to lock your car again.

66
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,680
You must be getting old.

67
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,560
It's all thanks to Zhanni.

68
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,560
Why are you coming over again?

69
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,160
Did you break up with Dongyang?

70
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,040
He's on a business trip.

71
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,920
Now you can see me at night as well.
Are you happy?

72
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,480
I'm so happy!

73
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,640
What's in the back seat? It's a mess.

74
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,160
My mom wanted them.

75
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:09,960
The supermarket had a sale.

76
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,840
Buy one box of detergent
and get another box for free.

77
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,560
It's a good deal.

78
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,520
-Let's go.
-Go.

79
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,640
<i>The victim received...</i>

80
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,920
It's useless to look at me.
I have to finish the news.

81
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,960
I'll put my bag and walk the dog.

82
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:32,920
Okay.

83
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,240
Dad, Mom. We're back!

84
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,760
You're early today.

85
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:37,880
I haven't cooked.

86
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,160
I'll make dinner now.

87
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,640
It's okay, Mr. He. I'm not hungry.

88
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,000
-Come here.
-Take a seat.

89
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,000
Sit down.

90
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,240
Have some dried fruits.

91
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,440
It's tasty. It's from Three Mice.

92
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,960
"Three Mice"?

93
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,480
No, not "mice"!

94
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,480
Three...

95
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,720
Three Squirrels!

96
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,480
Is Fanxing coming back?

97
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,880
She won't be back for dinner.

98
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,960
She's watching a movie with her colleague.

99
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,240
Forget her.
We'll eat fish with pickles for dinner.

100
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,520
Song Xue, do you want to tag along?

101
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:10,760
I'm free anyway.

102
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:11,840
Mrs. He, we'll walk the dog.

103
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:15,920
Canyang.

104
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,240
Did you buy the detergent?

105
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,760
Yes. They're in the car.

106
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,120
Should I bring them up now?

107
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,080
Okay!

108
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,440
All right!

109
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,200
Don't bark. I'm no match for you.

110
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,080
You'd better walk the dog first.

111
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,080
-Take it later.
-Okay.

112
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,360
Bye, Mrs. He.

113
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,960
Is anyone out there?

114
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,120
<i>Help me.</i>

115
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:16,040
<i>Somebody help me.</i>

116
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,960
Braised Meat!

117
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,520
Have you been good?

118
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,720
I'll take a shower and change.

119
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,760
The movie starts at 7:30 p.m.
We don't have to hurry.

120
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,200
We still have time for tea.

121
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,120
Okay, go ahead.

122
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,120
Even the painters aren't
as hardworking as you.

123
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,520
Braised Meat!

124
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,840
What do you want to eat?

125
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,600
Chicken?

126
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:44,720
Beef?

127
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,560
-What do you want?
-Fanxing.

128
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,680
Get me the towel on the balcony.

129
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,000
Well,

130
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:13,360
you were supervising the painters today
at the construction site.

131
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,680
What took you so long?

132
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,040
This morning,

133
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,760
I met a client.

134
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,440
Why did you stutter then?

135
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,800
You knew about it?

136
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,880
Answer the question honestly.

137
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,760
Why are you asking me back?

138
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,400
This morning, I went to see

139
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,000
my junior.

140
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,520
Is she the cute junior
who confessed to you at her birthday party

141
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,000
and got rejected
but promised to wait for you to break up?

142
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,680
-Goodness!
-Cut it out!

143
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:06,200
You are sophisticated
even when you're jealous.

144
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,840
I'm not jealous.

145
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,240
I...

146
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,760
I...

147
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:13,400
I'm just feeling uncomfortable.

148
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,360
There's a saying,

149
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:20,480
"Envy is scarier than stealing itself."

150
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,040
Don't worry.

151
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:27,120
Even if I'm not with you,
I won't be with her.

152
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,600
She's not my cup of tea.

153
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:31,320
I like beautiful and poised ladies.

154
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,360
So you like older women?

155
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,680
Enough about me.

156
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,480
Didn't you meet a good friend
on a blind date?

157
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,920
Who knows if he'd eventually fall for you?

158
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,000
That's nonsense!

159
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:47,280
He has a love interest whom he can't get.

160
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,680
He's a poor guy.

161
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,280
I was thinking about introducing Cong Xiao

162
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,080
to him this weekend.

163
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,920
Cong Xiao is pretty and cheerful.

164
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,000
Perhaps, she'll be able to save him
from the unrequited love.

165
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,880
Good idea.

166
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:04,920
I'll make tea.

167
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,600
Slow down!

168
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:10,880
Come back!

169
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,200
-Baylor!
-Stop or I'll cook you into a stew!

170
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,640
Baylor, you wore me out!

171
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,600
Why did you come here?

172
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,400
It's Yuan Song's house.

173
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,040
Does he live here?

174
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,840
He has a dog named Braised Meat.

175
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,200
We always walk the dogs together.

176
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,600
It's here for a friend.

177
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,280
PROFESSOR HE

178
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,000
Hello, Professor He.

179
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,920
Hello, are you off from work?

180
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,400
Let's walk the dogs.

181
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,840
I can't. I have a date.

182
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,600
So you're with your girlfriend?

183
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,720
All right then.

184
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,720
You put your girlfriend over friends.
I'm hanging up.

185
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,960
He's on a date. Let's go.

186
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,640
Let's go!

187
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:17,680
Who was that?

188
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,000
Professor He.

189
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:25,720
What's up?

190
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,360
His lights are on.

191
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,720
So he's at home.

192
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,240
He brought his girlfriend home.

193
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,480
He must be up to no good!

194
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:40,480
Hold it.

195
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:43,080
Wait here with Baylor. I'm going up.

196
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,160
Wait.

197
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:47,080
He's on a date. Leave him alone.

198
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,560
He's being very secretive this time.

199
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:54,360
I want to see who the girl
he has been hiding is.

200
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,320
I'll be back soon!

201
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,600
Canyang!

202
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,560
My goodness.

203
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,000
Fanxing, you're doomed!

204
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,280
<i>No time to explain.</i>

205
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,800
<i>Canyang is going up.</i>

206
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,320
<i>Hide if you don't want to get caught.</i>

207
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,600
SONG XUE

208
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,560
Come on, Braised Meat!

209
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:16,720
What's for dinner?

210
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,280
Why haven't you changed?

211
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,360
Change your clothes.

212
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,600
We're leaving soon.

213
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:30,720
Who's that?

214
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,880
I have no idea.

215
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,760
Yuan Song! I know you're home.

216
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,360
Professor He!

217
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:42,960
Canyang?

218
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:50,440
You only have one minute
to hide your girlfriend.

219
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,680
The shoes!

220
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,200
What's with the surprise visit?

221
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,800
I saw your lights from downstairs.

222
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,800
So I'm here to say hello
to your girlfriend.

223
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,160
She's not here.

224
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,640
I'm about to take a shower

225
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,040
and head out for a date.

226
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,000
You're going to shower?

227
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,240
That's a lot of sweat.

228
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:27,960
Is she not here?

229
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,800
-Let's have a look inside!
-Wait!

230
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,200
Why are you so nervous if no one's here?

231
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,360
Bedroom.

232
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,360
Why won't you let me in if she's not here?

233
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:58,720
Are you my dad?
Even my dad can't enter freely.

234
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:02,480
HE FANXING

235
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:05,840
Pick up the phone.

236
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,120
Whose phone is it?

237
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,640
What are you doing?

238
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:20,960
Aren't you leaving?

239
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,120
I wanted to.

240
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,800
But you kept lying

241
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,400
to hide your girlfriend.

242
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,800
She's either a person I know

243
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,160
or a guy.

244
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,240
A guy! It's a guy.

245
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,080
I got you. She must be someone I know!

246
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,320
Let me see!

247
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:43,600
HE FANXING

248
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,680
Let me go. My phone's ringing.

249
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,000
Hello.

250
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,920
Baylor ran off again?

251
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,200
That little brat.

252
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,000
I'm coming.

253
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:13,800
All right then.

254
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,080
Go on with your girl.

255
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,320
Right.

256
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,760
Use protection.

257
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,120
Don't harm the girl.

258
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:49,600
Come out!

259
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,440
He left.

260
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:10,080
Why did he come here all of a sudden?

261
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,600
Who was calling me just now?

262
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,920
Who was calling me? Let me see.

263
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,000
1 MISSED CALL
SONG XUE

264
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:22,120
Isn't it here?

265
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Walk your dog.

266
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:28,080
Listen. It was so funny.

267
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,160
Slow down!

268
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,160
When I went up,

269
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,080
he was naked!

270
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,400
He was only wearing a bathrobe.

271
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,520
-His hair was still wet.
-Okay...

272
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,120
What's wrong?

273
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:40,680
Are you not interested?

274
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:03,960
You're back.

275
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,600
Did I wake you?

276
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,160
I wasn't sleeping. I was waiting for you.

277
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,480
I see.

278
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,600
How was the movie?

279
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:29,760
Not bad.

280
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,160
When did you know about it?

281
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,280
That day when I slept here.

282
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,840
When you were showering,

283
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,480
I accidentally saw his message.

284
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:54,160
Being in a relationship
with my brother's student

285
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,160
is difficult to talk about.

286
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,040
As long as you're happy.

287
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,360
It sounds like

288
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,400
you're scolding me.

289
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,160
I mean it.

290
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,120
Live in the moment and follow your heart.

291
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,240
Not many people can do that.

292
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,400
Am I being a coward

293
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,400
for keeping it secret?

294
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,920
If you ask me,

295
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,480
it's more like avoiding risks.

296
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,840
Just go with the flow.

297
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,320
Don't think too much.

298
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:39,080
You're finally in love for the first time.

299
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,520
I feel happy for you.

300
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,320
By the way,

301
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,400
don't ever let Xiaoyu know.

302
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,440
Don't worry. I won't tell her.

303
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,800
If she knows about this...

304
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,480
"What should I do? Should I tell Mrs. He?"

305
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:57,120
"No! I'll betray my best friend!"

306
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:58,840
"Mrs. He.

307
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:02,360
I have no idea that Fanxing
is seeing a university student.

308
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,760
Please don't ask me about this."

309
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:14,840
I'm tired.

310
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,040
Aren't you happily in love now?

311
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,720
Why are you tired?

312
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,160
It's like...

313
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:31,040
I really wanted to be in love before.

314
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,120
Now that I am,

315
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,960
I start to worry if I'll fail.

316
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,080
This boy is really something!

317
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,560
He is making this lady anxious

318
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:45,320
and obsessed with him.

319
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,360
Well...

320
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:55,200
Is the skin of a young boy
so much smoother?

321
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,040
A friend of mine described it

322
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:00,920
like being embraced

323
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
by a dolphin with silky smooth skin.

324
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,200
Your friend?

325
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,640
She's a 40-year-old female CEO,

326
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,800
dating a 25-year-old boyfriend.

327
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:17,080
She's pampering him
like a luxurious pet dolphin.

328
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:20,840
She spent a fortune
buying him branded goods.

329
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:25,400
I've never touched a dolphin before.

330
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:27,960
But his skin

331
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,880
is so full of collagen.

332
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:36,320
However, he's not a luxurious pet
who depends on branded goods.

333
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,040
We are

334
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,840
having a relationship based on

335
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,800
mutual respect and freedom.

336
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,120
Then,

337
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,240
what about his--

338
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:51,240
Cut it off!

339
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:52,800
If we continue,

340
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,520
it'll be censored.

341
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,840
I envy you.

342
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,360
It might be tiring,

343
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,240
but it's a sweet surrender.

344
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,360
Isn't this term used for parents and kids?

345
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,120
All right.

346
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,640
I'm going to apply a mask.

347
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:19,440
The mask you gave me
that's worth over 100 yuan.

348
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,600
That brat.

349
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:35,280
He hasn't brought me the detergent yet.

350
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:59,920
<i>Baby, you were not home,
so I took the liberty of coming in.</i>

351
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,560
<i>I made your favorite dishes.</i>

352
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,440
<i>There's braised stew in the fridge.</i>

353
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:04,760
<i>Take care of yourself.</i>

354
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,120
<i>Love you.</i>

355
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:21,840
Cai Minmin?

356
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:25,960
The car was locked.

357
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,240
How did you get in?

358
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,840
Explain yourself or I'll...

359
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:40,720
There's some leftover beef.

360
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,120
I added some fried eggs too.

361
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,280
Why are you hungry again?

362
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:47,120
Didn't you eat a lot just now?

363
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:48,880
Mom.

364
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:50,800
I'll help myself.

365
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,360
Sleep early.

366
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:53,920
Thank you, Mom.

367
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,320
Don't wake up too late.

368
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:01,800
Okay.

369
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,080
Mom, rest early.

370
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,280
<i>Door unlocked.</i>

371
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:15,760
<i>Door locked.</i>

372
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,480
I'm alive!

373
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,360
Your mom's noodles are superb.

374
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:45,200
I feel like I'm feeding a pig.

375
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,440
I'm still growing.

376
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,880
And I haven't eaten all day.

377
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:52,120
I was locked in your car for five hours.

378
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,720
Why didn't you get out earlier?

379
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:57,320
Professor Song was in your car!

380
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,000
I was afraid and missed the chance.

381
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,880
I couldn't get out after that.

382
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,360
If you're afraid of her,

383
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,760
you should study hard.

384
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,960
I am stupid. I just can't learn.

385
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:11,400
Sure, I'm convinced.

386
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,920
You've eaten. Go home now.

387
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:17,840
So, Professor Song
is your sister's best friend.

388
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,680
Is she really spending the night
at your mom's place?

389
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,160
If not?

390
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:24,040
Do you need her boyfriend's number?

391
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,880
Tell him he has been cheated on.

392
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:28,720
No, there's no need.

393
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,240
My dear teachers,

394
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:35,160
both of you have proved
my innocence today.

395
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,440
You're like the modern Bao Qingtian.

396
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,320
I believe in you two.

397
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,640
I can be the witness
to your pure friendship.

398
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:43,960
One more thing.

399
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,880
Why did you tell others
that she was my first love?

400
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,520
Zhanni is my best friend.

401
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:51,000
-She's not an outsider.
-Okay.

402
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,320
Since when did you become my goddess?
Why didn't I know?

403
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:57,440
Damn it!

404
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:58,960
All right. I get it!

405
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:00,320
I'll shut up.

406
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,040
You're such a sensitive guy.

407
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,560
What did you say?

408
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,120
Do you have drinks in here?

409
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:11,400
You already ate. It's time to go home.

410
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,960
The dorm is closed. I can't go back.

411
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,600
Sleep by the road then.

412
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:40,960
Why are you still here?

413
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,440
I want to eat breakfast first.

414
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,760
Is my house a pig's den?

415
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Canyang.

416
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,080
Lend me your razor.

417
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,360
I need to shave my legs.

418
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:01,600
Use Dad's.

419
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,080
What?

420
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,720
I can't. It's an electric razor.

421
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,240
I haven't seen mine for a while.

422
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,560
I don't know where it is.

423
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,080
I wonder where it is.

424
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:12,400
I remember!

425
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,760
I put it in the toilet cabinet.

426
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:17,520
You always put your things everywhere.

427
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,920
Dirty socks on the table.

428
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,120
You never wash your underwear.

429
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:24,800
If we didn't live near you,
your place would be a mess!

430
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,840
Enough! Knock it off!

431
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,000
I'll get it myself.

432
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:30,920
What?

433
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,520
Let me tell you a gossip.

434
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,280
What is it?

435
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,120
Yesterday,

436
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,040
I caught Yuan Song's girlfriend
in his house.

437
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,280
He just finished showering

438
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:50,080
and came out with a bathrobe.

439
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,960
I caught him red-handed.

440
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:55,360
It was almost like
I caught them cheating in the act.

441
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,000
And then I--

442
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,920
Look at you!
Can't you behave like a professor?

443
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,920
So what if he has a girlfriend?

444
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:07,240
Taking a shower doesn't mean
they were doing it!

445
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:10,280
He might have gotten dirty
at the construction site.

446
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,040
You're gross and disgusting!

447
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:15,520
Pervert!

448
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,640
Did you see Yuan Song's girlfriend?

449
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:30,800
What does she look like?

450
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:32,480
Is she pretty?

451
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,400
You're really in the honeymoon period.

452
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,280
You just went on a date last night.

453
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,920
Now, you're going to meet again.

454
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,840
You might get bored of him soon.

455
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:52,600
What happened?

456
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,080
I cut myself while shaving my legs

457
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,440
with my eyebrow razor.

458
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:59,200
It came true.

459
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:00,800
What?

460
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:03,840
The energy of Mercury retrograde
is the strongest today.

461
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,440
All horoscopes
are being affected right now.

462
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,680
Nothing will go right.

463
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,200
As the saying goes,

464
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:15,120
"If you don't work hard,
you can only blame Mercury retrograde."

465
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:18,120
You can neither
believe in horoscopes blindly

466
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,320
nor totally ignore it.

467
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:23,560
So be careful when you speak
during your date.

468
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:26,760
Avoid discussing topics
that'll cause dispute.

469
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:31,720
Just do as I say.

470
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:34,080
Flip your hair, then look at him and say,

471
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:37,480
"Would you like to eat lunch or me first?"

472
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,480
What a lousy move.

473
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,560
Are you not sleeping here next week?

474
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:48,560
Going to work with Doggy
saves my gasoline expenses.

475
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,000
However,

476
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:52,360
Dongyang is coming back soon.

477
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,800
Thank goodness, he's finally back!

478
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,640
I won't get kicked again at night.

479
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,400
Come on. You're not any better.

480
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:04,320
You sleep like an old lady and you drool.

481
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,880
All right, that's enough. You look pretty!

482
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,040
Let's go.

483
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,600
Wear perfume before that.

484
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,080
Here, have some.

485
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:19,960
-It's choking me!
-How nice!

486
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,120
Let's go!

487
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:29,800
<i>Actually,</i>

488
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,120
<i>after Canyang's surprise visit,</i>

489
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:36,400
<i>our date ended with a fight.</i>

490
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,640
Who was calling me? Let me see.

491
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,520
1 MISSED CALL
SONG XUE

492
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,280
How did Song Xue know about it?

493
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:47,880
Song Xue?

494
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:50,080
Professor Song?

495
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:52,800
It can't be. Let me think.

496
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,560
Let me think.

497
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,400
Does Canyang know too?

498
00:30:58,760 --> 00:30:59,680
No.

499
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,360
It didn't seem like he knew.

500
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,360
Isn't that right?

501
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,400
That's right.

502
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:07,280
How did Song Xue know then?

503
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,440
Did I talk in my sleep?

504
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,880
What should I do?

505
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,640
It's good that they know.

506
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:22,120
It really felt like I was caught cheating.

507
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,240
As if I've done something bad.

508
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:26,440
I nearly had a heart attack.

509
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:30,240
It's over if they know.

510
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,400
They'll know eventually.

511
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,560
No way!

512
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:34,840
We might break up immediately!

513
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,840
So you have been preparing

514
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:44,320
to break up with me?

515
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,480
MEIYIN

516
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:22,200
<i>Goddess of Mercy, Guan Yin.</i>

517
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:25,200
<i>Please guide me!</i>

518
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:42,840
Let's meet tomorrow.

519
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:46,120
If we don't meet tomorrow,

520
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,960
I'll be unhappy over the weekend.

521
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:49,880
I'll be moody on Monday too.

522
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:51,320
Let's just erase

523
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,960
this unhappy memory.

524
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:57,200
Okay.

525
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:58,800
That's a good idea.

526
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:01,160
Let's meet up tomorrow morning.

527
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:08,840
<i>When I was trying to make it up to him,</i>

528
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:10,760
<i>he was trying hard</i>

529
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12,160
<i>to make it up to me too.</i>

530
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,320
I bet you haven't had breakfast.

531
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:16,520
I bought beef noodles.

532
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:19,680
Great. That was what I wanted.

533
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:39,400
What's wrong?

534
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,960
I'm charging myself.

535
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:46,960
Chang Huan called and told me
to visit the site at 9:00 a.m.

536
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:50,680
Will it take long?

537
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,760
No. Two hours maximum.

538
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:04,080
Then,

539
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,840
do you want to eat the noodles first

540
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:08,960
or...

541
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:11,280
drink coffee?

542
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:13,800
Do you have coffee?

543
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,800
There's instant coffee in the fridge.

544
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,280
<i>She's my family.</i>

545
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:35,080
<i>She came in without telling me.</i>

546
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:04,800
What are you doing?

547
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:06,960
I smell perfume.

548
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:09,720
Isn't it the smell of coffee?

549
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:12,640
Is that so?

550
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:19,680
Hurry up.

551
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,200
Okay.

552
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:31,560
I'll be back in two hours.
Watch TV at home.

553
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,320
Should I get you a manicurist?

554
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:37,880
Don't worry. I won't feel bored.

555
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:40,400
I have things I want to do.

556
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,840
Buy me a mille crepe cake
on your way back.

557
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,720
Let's watch a movie at home.

558
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,320
Deal.

559
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:50,600
Come back early.

560
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:51,600
All right.

561
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,080
I'm heading out.

562
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:56,640
Bye.

563
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:09,760
Perfect.

564
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:19,840
That's the right angle.

565
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:21,760
Right. Now, drag it outwards.

566
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,120
All right.

567
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:28,760
That was close!

568
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,200
Any coins left?

569
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,240
Just one.

570
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:35,840
Put it in.

571
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,240
I'll kill you!

572
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,240
Calm down!

573
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,440
Give me back my doll!

574
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:05,720
What? You slept with Mr. He last night?

575
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:08,200
I slept at his house!

576
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,480
I did not sleep with him!

577
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,760
That's amazing progress.

578
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,560
It's not like that.

579
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:19,000
He also said that he met
Yuan Song's girlfriend at his house.

580
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,560
Who is she exactly?

581
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:24,440
What does she look like?

582
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:25,800
No idea.

583
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,480
He said he didn't see her.

584
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,680
Are they living together already?

585
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,800
Who is she exactly?

586
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:37,280
If you want to know,
then take a look for yourself!

587
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:39,360
Yuan Song's home is nearby anyway.

588
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:41,560
He mostly stays at home on weekends.

589
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:44,560
Good idea!

590
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,200
Let's pay a surprise visit!

591
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:49,000
If they're living together,
we'll be able to see her.

592
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:52,080
Isn't it a little rude?

593
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:54,120
We'll bring him a present then.

594
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,520
-Am I right, Big Head?
-Yes! Let's get a fruit basket.

595
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:02,720
I think...

596
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:08,960
Let's go now!

597
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:11,200
Hey.

598
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:13,960
-Wait up.
-Hey, Melon!

599
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:18,560
Ma'am, this is not a spotlight!

600
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:20,040
It's a downlight!

601
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,560
We won't put spotlights in bedrooms!

602
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,560
Spotlights have high temperatures!

603
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:28,000
There are a lot of fabrics
in the bedroom. It's not safe!

604
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:30,720
My daughter told me!

605
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:33,280
This is a spotlight!

606
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:36,240
Spotlights are not good!
They're too bright!

607
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:39,040
Ma'am, you're right! They're too bright!

608
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:40,200
I get it!

609
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:42,520
But this is not a spotlight!

610
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:45,440
The lights above the paintings
on the walls are spotlights!

611
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:47,160
The angle can be adjusted!

612
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:50,400
My daughter doesn't want spotlights
in the bedroom!

613
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:53,840
Yes. We didn't put spotlights
in the bedroom.

614
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,040
No spotlights!

615
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:56,120
This is

616
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,000
a spotlight!

617
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,840
It was just to explain
about the downlight and spotlight.

618
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,520
Did you have to call me on a weekend?

619
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,920
I didn't know it was only about lighting.

620
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:11,200
She sounded serious over the phone.

621
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:14,840
I thought she wanted
to knock down the wall like that guy.

622
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,480
What? Did I ruin your date?

623
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:18,600
That's right.

624
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:20,640
Look at your temper.

625
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:23,440
People might think
you're some mysterious rich kid.

626
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:28,440
Don't you have a date
with Cong Xiao and Qingqing?

627
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:30,280
That's not a date.

628
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,800
We're just having lunch.

629
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,480
Do you want to join us?

630
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:35,640
I seldom buy people meals.

631
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:37,800
I get it.

632
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:39,240
You have a date today.

633
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:40,280
Go ahead then.

634
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:44,040
No wonder they say you're stingy.

635
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:47,760
A bachelor like myself

636
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:49,600
has to save for retirement.

637
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:51,240
Others can say whatever they want.

638
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:54,000
What matters is
I have money in my account.

639
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:55,480
Let me ask you.

640
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:57,240
What's the happiest way to spend money?

641
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:58,760
Spend money?

642
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,600
Spend as I wish?

643
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,320
That's partially correct.

644
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:04,160
The correct answer

645
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,520
is to spend money

646
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:06,960
of others at will.

647
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:08,920
Let's go!

648
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:21,960
How do I look?

649
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:23,640
Your hair looks messy.

650
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:29,040
Come here!

651
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:40,960
Perfect.

652
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,200
What are you doing?

653
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:46,120
This is a war between ladies.

654
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:48,280
If Yuan Song's girlfriend is at home,

655
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,600
we must look prettier than her!

656
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,680
This is Yuan Song's house, right?

657
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:20,560
You're his maid, aren't you?

658
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:22,440
We're their classmates.

659
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:24,960
Yuan Song is not home. He went out.

660
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:26,720
When will he come home?

661
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,920
I'm not sure about that.

662
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:31,320
I'll ask him to contact you
when he is back.

663
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:33,400
It's okay.

664
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:34,760
We're free anyway.

665
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,200
We'll wait inside.

666
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:38,520
It's not a good time.

667
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:41,400
-How about--
-Braised Meat!

668
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:51,520
I missed you so much.

669
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:52,960
Give Zhanni a kiss.

670
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:57,600
Your classmates suddenly
came to your house.

671
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:00,040
I couldn't just chase them off.

672
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:01,400
Luckily,

673
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:03,440
they thought I was your maid.

674
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:05,000
When you're back,

675
