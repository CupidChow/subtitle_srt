1
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,800
<i>I think that you are a catch</i>

2
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,600
<i>and very pretty.</i>

3
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,960
<i>You are not spoiled
like a typical only child</i>

4
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,480
<i>and you're kind too.</i>

5
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,440
<i>A fine lady like you</i>

6
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:11,080
<i>should have many admirers.</i>

7
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,080
<i>Why do you need to go on blind dates?</i>

8
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:17,920
Actually,

9
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,960
I wonder about that too.

10
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,360
Perhaps that is the reason

11
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,880
why no one has been courting me.

12
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,560
Talking about age might sound rude,

13
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,960
but allow me to be frank.

14
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,520
You're already 32 years old.

15
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,800
I mean, I am 32 years old as well.

16
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,000
At this age,

17
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,760
we are no longer that young,
so let's be straightforward.

18
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,320
Straightforward?

19
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,480
Yes, be straightforward.

20
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,400
Just ask what you want to know.

21
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,320
Testing each other is a waste of time.

22
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:57,120
What if I were to tell you
that I don't want to get married,

23
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,240
and would like to waste time dating?

24
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,560
I thought you'd be more anxious than I am.

25
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,960
At your age, you are considered
as an old, leftover woman.

26
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,080
I didn't mean to belittle you.

27
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,760
<i>What he meant</i>

28
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,720
<i>by "leftover woman" is</i>

29
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,320
<i>an older woman,
who is left unpicked by men.</i>

30
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,560
<i>Similar to those outdated clothes on sale
at the shopping mall,</i>

31
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,480
<i>the leftovers in the fridge,</i>

32
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,760
<i>and the buy 4,
get 3 free yogurts in the supermarket,</i>

33
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,760
<i>which are close to their expiration dates.</i>

34
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,840
<i>After hitting 30 years old,</i>

35
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,720
<i>the probability of finding love</i>

36
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,480
<i>has plummeted dramatically.</i>

37
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,360
<i>Time has become
the most precious commodity.</i>

38
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,560
<i>"Don't be so picky.</i>

39
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,840
<i>Just settle down."</i>

40
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,080
<i>"Look at you, you are not exactly young."</i>

41
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,840
<i>Those insignificant words</i>

42
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,400
<i>turned into a pair of sharp scissors</i>

43
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,400
<i>and cut my pride</i>

44
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,080
<i>into pieces.</i>

45
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,240
<i>What others say about us</i>

46
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,600
<i>is not scary.</i>

47
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:07,120
<i>The scariest thing is when you believe it.</i>

48
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,680
<i>As for those girls who don't believe it,</i>

49
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,720
<i>even after they have passed 30,</i>

50
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,240
<i>they are still hopeful and passionate</i>

51
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,320
<i>for love and good things.</i>

52
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,640
<i>They were not chosen,</i>

53
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,120
<i>yet they don't choose others.</i>

54
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,000
<i>They look forward to loving someone</i>

55
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,600
<i>and being loved.</i>

56
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,120
<i>They are glowing beings
filled with warmth.</i>

57
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,040
<i>They are girls with sophistication.</i>

58
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,520
MY RESUME

59
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,560
Come in.

60
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,400
Ms. He, were you looking for me?

61
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,560
Yes.

62
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,000
These are the resumes of the new staff.

63
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,720
Please call them to confirm the details
on their first day tomorrow.

64
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,400
I've already indicated their staff numbers
and seat arrangements.

65
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,200
Okay.

66
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,640
Tidy up their tables this afternoon

67
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,360
and set up their office equipment too.

68
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,160
There are no computers in the warehouse.

69
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,960
The upgraded computers
for the design team will arrive today.

70
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,320
-Let them use the old ones.
-Okay.

71
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,720
RESUME

72
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,120
There's a kid born in 1997!

73
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,520
Why?

74
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,760
Don't you like young colleagues?

75
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:20,960
No.

76
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,320
I won't even have an opportunity
for office romance then.

77
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,880
Two years ago,
I could lie to myself by saying,

78
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,760
"Women age like wine."

79
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:30,760
But now,

80
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,960
this old aunt can't bear to approach them.

81
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,760
You're already acting this way
at 30 years old.

82
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:38,880
Then what about me?

83
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,000
It's time to work.

84
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,280
Hello. What's the matter?

85
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,640
<i>Do you have a date
with Li Haomiao tonight?</i>

86
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:01,880
How did you know?

87
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,400
How did I know?

88
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:07,120
With He Canyang's big mouth,
how could I not know?

89
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,920
During the Vice Principal's birthday,

90
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,040
he was drunk.

91
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:14,000
If I hadn't stopped him,
he would've sold me out.

92
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,960
When you secretly dated my brother
in high school,

93
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,600
<i>didn't you expect this would happen?</i>

94
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,080
Everyone has a dark past.

95
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,800
If my colleagues were to find out
that he was my first love,

96
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:25,840
I would kill myself.

97
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,320
At least you have a first love.

98
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,200
I don't even have one.

99
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:33,040
<i>Should Yu and I be your bodyguards?</i>

100
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,400
There will surely be a 50 percent chance

101
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:38,480
for you to meet a 90-kg fat man.

102
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,800
Thank you, but don't worry about me.

103
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,320
I'm hanging up.

104
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,000
Ms. He, you have received a parcel.

105
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,280
Thank you.

106
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,760
Here.

107
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,320
Chang Huan, this is yours.

108
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,160
Thank you, Ms. He.

109
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,600
I could just get it myself.

110
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,400
I was picking mine up anyway.

111
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,440
Otherwise, I'd have to check the list
one by one.

112
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,840
Did you stay up late last night
playing games again?

113
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,160
I stayed up to finish my design.

114
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,000
So you were playing during the day.

115
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,880
Any idea how high your salary deductions
are for this month?

116
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,840
Please forgive me.

117
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,840
I won't be able to pay my house loan
if I were to get another deduction.

118
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:25,760
Look.

119
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:29,040
I've just gotten a red bomb
from our colleague in marketing.

120
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,280
Whose is it?

121
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:32,680
Zeng's.

122
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,320
Isn't she still going on blind dates?

123
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:41,440
That is old news from three months ago.

124
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:51,280
Are you getting married
only after dating for two months?

125
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,040
That's a quick conquer!

126
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,840
Congratulations!

127
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,920
We've already registered our marriage.
We just need to have the reception.

128
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,760
Zeng, you're only 27 years old.

129
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,360
Why are you in such a hurry?

130
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,480
I am not.

131
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,440
This little one is.

132
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:07,920
Congratulations!

133
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,640
Oh my goodness!

134
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,080
Look at your efficiency.

135
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,280
-Youngsters sure are healthy.
-Stop it.

136
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:16,600
You're going to be a mother!
That's way too quick!

137
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:19,560
I'll look bad in my dress
once the bump shows.

138
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,000
The baby has to be registered

139
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,040
at the hospital.

140
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,760
Nowadays,
be it giving birth at the hospital

141
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,880
or sending the kids to school,
we have to prepare beforehand.

142
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,920
After having a baby,

143
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,400
it'll be like going on a battle.

144
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:33,520
You're wrong.

145
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,120
We've been in battles since we were born,

146
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,640
but the battlefields keep changing.

147
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,640
You have conquered yours in no time.

148
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:43,160
I am still in a guerrilla warfare
to find a rich husband.

149
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:46,440
I am three years past the age
of late marriage.

150
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,240
Once women turn 25,

151
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,440
the clock starts to tick faster.

152
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:53,160
If you don't have a sense of crisis,

153
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,120
you would turn 30 in no time.

154
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,760
What's wrong with being 30?

155
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:01,560
After my 30th birthday next month,
am I going to die?

156
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,480
You won't die when you reach 30.

157
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,320
But to a 30-year-old on the dating market,

158
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,480
you can't compete against
a fresh graduate like Qingqing.

159
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,400
I never said I wanted a man. Not a chance.

160
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,400
It's fun to play with my phone
and watch movies.

161
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:17,280
I can travel abroad for a month
every year.

162
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,120
I feel so happy and carefree.

163
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:23,920
If I don't meet a man like Sebastian,
I'll never get married.

164
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,000
What? Do you like foreigners?

165
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:29,040
He's a character from
a manga called <i>Black Butler</i>.

166
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,840
Have you ever read it?

167
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,320
Sebastian is such a gentleman.

168
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,000
You just graduated,

169
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,160
so keep on dreaming
while you're still young.

170
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,840
When you turn 30
but you're still obsessed with idols,

171
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,280
and live in a fantasy

172
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,120
with a brain
full of unrealistic idol dramas,

173
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,800
then prepare yourself to die alone.

174
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,160
That's right.

175
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,600
When you should date,

176
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,720
don't waste your time
daydreaming about mangas

177
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,080
and pretty boys.

178
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,800
If you were to end up like Ms. He,

179
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,720
who has never even dated

180
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,560
even though she is already 32,

181
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:04,960
that would be the worst!

182
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,720
No way!

183
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,920
What a pity.

184
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,040
Show some gratitude.

185
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,280
Ms. He is so nice to you.

186
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,520
I'm just saying.

187
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,720
Truthfully, I do love our director.

188
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:23,360
Among the women in this company,
she's the only one older than me.

189
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,600
You're terrible.

190
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,920
It took you so long
just to make a cup of coffee.

191
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,320
Were you planting coffee beans?

192
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,480
Why?

193
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,480
Can't you stand even a few minutes
without me?

194
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,560
Of course not.

195
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:46,560
The phone on your desk kept ringing,
so I couldn't even draw.

196
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,200
Don't blame your own problems
on other people.

197
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,360
Would it hurt you to answer it?

198
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,640
No, it wouldn't.

199
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:57,960
However, I didn't want to offend
your client and jeopardize your success.

200
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,160
So,

201
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,400
should I thank you for that?

202
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,600
You're welcome.

203
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:06,960
You're welcome.

204
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,800
Hello, this is Amazing Decoration.
How may I help you?

205
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,640
Yes, Ms. Su Li.

206
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,000
Yes, go ahead.

207
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,320
Don't send the raw footage yourself later.

208
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,520
Just send an intern here to take the heat.

209
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,480
The T-Rex is in a very bad mood

210
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,960
that he may start blowing fire.

211
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,520
Did his wife cheat on him?

212
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,520
<i>How can he have a wife with his temper?</i>

213
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:33,800
Your company's sudden footage change
has already triggered the T-Rex.

214
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,640
He was set on canceling your contract.

215
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:38,080
Unfortunately,
his dog went missing last night.

216
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,360
So today is a day of disaster.

217
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,720
<i>He'll be a pain in the neck.</i>

218
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:41,920
What should I do?

219
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,560
My intern is out
to collect a client's contract.

220
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,000
Anyway, as your senior,
I have already reminded you.

221
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,160
It is up to you now.

222
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,240
All right, I'll buy you a meal one day.

223
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,520
<i>Goodbye.</i>

224
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:55,840
Good day, Ms. Su Li.

225
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:17,960
Good morning, Mr. Ye.

226
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,200
Morning?

227
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,320
It no longer is.

228
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,160
Right now, my dog should be home
eating canned food.

229
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,760
As per your instructions,

230
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,640
all paper stands and bus stops
have already been posted with notices,

231
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:30,480
within a two-kilometer radius around
the park where your dog went missing.

232
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,960
-So is there still no news?
-Morning, Mr. Ye.

233
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,440
-Yes.
-Great.

234
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,160
I hope I don't have any work today.

235
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,760
You are personally in charge
of the Amazing Decoration ad.

236
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:41,320
They will send us the new footage
by 2 p.m.

237
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,880
The magazines are scheduled
for printing today.

238
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,400
How can I allow them
to change the photo today?

239
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,760
This is the second time
they have done this.

240
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,120
Tell them not to send it anymore.

241
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,240
Also, terminate the contract immediately.

242
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,800
-You agreed to this yesterday
-Morning, Mr. Ye.

243
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,080
and decided to terminate it
after this issue.

244
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,160
Did I?

245
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,400
I don't recall.

246
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:08,720
Mr. Ye.

247
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:18,920
Who brought their pet to the office?

248
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,840
If Ms. He sees this,
she will fine you for it.

249
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,080
Did you bring it here?

250
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,640
Ms. He.

251
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:31,400
I hate hassles so the puppy isn't mine.

252
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,080
Fine whoever brought it.

253
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,800
The person has already been fined 200 yuan
for bringing pets.

254
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,040
Pardon?

255
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:39,960
Who is it?

256
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,120
Me.

257
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,240
Ms. He.

258
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,840
I have a favor to ask.

259
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,520
Go on.

260
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,240
I have to meet the photographer
on-site today for a shoot,

261
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,880
then send it over to the ad agency.

262
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:55,480
But a client has just
asked me for a meeting

263
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,960
and I have sent out all of my interns.

264
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,680
My hands are tied.

265
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,760
Could you lend me an intern?

266
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,400
But there's no intern
in the administration department.

267
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:08,880
Any transfer or lending of interns
needs consent from Mr. Li.

268
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:11,440
In the last meeting, didn't Mr. Li say

269
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:14,400
that whenever he's not here,
except for marketing affairs,

270
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,280
you have the authority to decide.

271
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,000
That may be true,

272
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:19,920
but look around.

273
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,960
Everyone is so busy with their own work.

274
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,880
Fanxing,

275
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,120
my hands are tied here.

276
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,480
You are the all-powerful Ms. He

277
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,280
to all the staff here.

278
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,960
Please save me, Ms. He.

279
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,520
How about Yuan Song?

280
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,960
The design intern could spare some time.

281
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,200
Yuan Song.

282
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,280
Where's Yuan Song?

283
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,280
Come in!

284
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,320
Assistant Professor He.

285
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,520
The sunflower symbolizes an unspoken love.

286
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,160
Are all unspoken love

287
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,760
as aloof as you are?

288
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,240
Yuan Song,

289
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,680
not all of my ex-girlfriends

290
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:02,040
have attended
my art appreciation class like you.

291
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,360
Romance is the key.

292
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,400
Fine.

293
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,880
I have no comment
on your relationship views.

294
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,040
Why are you here today?

295
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,000
I had a thesis review with a professor.

296
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,840
I passed by your office,
so I thought I should say hi.

297
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,120
Why don't you have discussions
on the weekends?

298
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,040
Is it easy to ask for a leave
from He Fanxing?

299
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,760
It's not, so I didn't ask.

300
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:27,760
Then you are screwed.

301
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,000
She will definitely remember you.

302
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,720
She promised to take care of you and
help you get your internship certificate,

303
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,800
so she will be very strict with you.

304
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,080
Are you even twins?

305
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,840
Your personalities are so different.

306
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,720
If I had known she was so strict

307
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:44,080
and would watch over me
like a kindergarten kid,

308
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,680
I wouldn't have my internship there.

309
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:46,600
Is that so?

310
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,720
You seem quite happy to me.

311
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:52,280
If she smiled at me every day,
I would be happier.

312
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,480
You're expecting your manager
to smile at you every day?

313
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:55,640
What are you thinking?

314
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:56,880
Back then,

315
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:59,880
you begged me to introduce a company
to you for your internship.

316
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,640
But He Fanxing is in a good mood today.

317
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:06,320
Maybe she'll just nag at you.

318
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,000
I'll be honest with you.

319
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:17,280
Today is the day she might change her fate
with her first love.

320
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:20,600
Ten years ago, she made a promise
with her college classmate.

321
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:23,040
If they were both still single
after ten years,

322
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,440
they would be together.

323
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:27,200
Did she travel here from the past?

324
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:28,680
Who would believe that?

325
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,320
I wouldn't believe it
if it were someone else.

326
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,760
But He Fanxing is an alien

327
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,320
while Li Haomiao is a weirdo.

328
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:38,480
They are made for each other,
and they can definitely make this happen.

329
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,600
After Li Haomiao graduated,

330
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,240
he went to the South Pole
to study penguins.

331
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,760
There are no women in their base.

332
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,440
Is that considered true love

333
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:47,720
or just a backup?

334
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:51,560
It is similar to how
modern celebrities freeze their eggs.

335
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:54,040
It is considered
as freezing their first love.

336
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,160
That's right.

337
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,400
Freezing their first love.

338
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,000
How lame.

339
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,000
You should continue.

340
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:05,040
I'll drop by the club,
then head to the site.

341
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,080
All right.

342
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,240
I'll get going.

343
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:12,040
Come for a meal this weekend,
we can play ball after that.

344
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,320
Sure, see you then.

345
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,520
One, two, three.

346
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,680
Two, two, three.

347
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,720
One, two, three.

348
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,800
Two, two, three.

349
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,880
One, two, three.

350
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,000
Two, two, three.

351
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,080
One, two, three.

352
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:33,320
Two, two, three.

353
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,680
Girls, left foot back,

354
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,600
keep up with the rhythm and do it again.

355
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,400
Okay, start all over again.

356
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:56,440
Hey, is that all you know?

357
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,720
You are so impatient
when it has only been a few days.

358
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:03,000
Ever heard the story
of Da Vinci drawing duck eggs?

359
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:06,080
No, we have only heard
of him drawing chicken eggs.

360
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,600
The small one is a chicken,
while the big one is a duck.

361
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,960
It doesn't matter which egg it is.

362
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,720
Didn't you say there were cute boys
in this club?

363
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,320
I don't want them.

364
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:21,880
Neither do I.

365
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,520
He's so cute.

366
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,040
Consider yourselves lucky.

367
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,560
My partner is here.

368
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,160
We shall dance for you,

369
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,080
so that you won't keep
questioning my abilities.

370
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,120
Make way.

371
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:41,840
Music, please.

372
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,920
-He is so handsome.
-He is!

373
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,800
-Look, he is so handsome.
-Yes, he is.

374
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,040
<i>Is Yuan Song not in?</i>

375
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,000
Yesterday, he said...

376
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:22,080
he would go to school today
and then head directly to the site.

377
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:26,280
You are in charge of him,
so you should be responsible.

378
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,480
No leave, no clock-in.

379
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,520
Even if he has given up on his internship,

380
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,120
don't you want your bonus
for managing him?

381
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,080
Ms. He.

382
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:37,920
Why don't you let someone else
take charge of that uncontrollable teen?

383
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,480
I don't want another pay deduction.

384
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,640
Are you asking me to fire him?

385
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:42,880
No.

386
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,160
Yuan Song is very capable
that he can design on his own.

387
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,920
He's a rare talent.

388
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,000
But he's like the wind.

389
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,320
I can't contain him.

390
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:52,840
You're right.

391
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:55,240
The design of an intern

392
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:58,760
has defeated the design
of a top-notch designer.

393
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,280
If I were you,

394
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,360
I would have resigned and gone back
to my hometown.

395
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:05,440
All right.

396
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,200
I'll deal with him.

397
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,320
This is what we will do, Cong Xiao.

398
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:12,000
I've taken the rest of the day off
for some errands.

399
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,360
I'll help you with it.

400
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,200
That's not right.

401
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,120
I can't let my superior
run errands for me.

402
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:20,400
-It'd be better if I do it--
-I'm more reliable than an intern.

403
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,400
It's settled then.

404
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,000
It's bad if we leave the dog out here.

405
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,400
I'll keep it inside.

406
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,680
Send me the address.

407
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,160
But...

408
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,240
Let's go.

409
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,600
TIMESHEET

410
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:46,520
YUAN SONG

411
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:57,280
Hello, Ms. He.

412
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,640
Anything I can help you with?

413
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59,760
Last month,

414
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:02,200
you were late for eight times
and absent twice.

415
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:06,200
You're not on leave today and didn't
come in, so you're absent again.

416
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:08,040
According to the company regulations,

417
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,360
<i>if you are late for more than
five times a month,</i>

418
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,960
<i>-we need to have a talk.</i>
-Who's that? What a nag.

419
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,160
She's my boss,

420
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,880
the executive director of our company.

421
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:17,600
The sister of Assistant Professor He.

422
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,360
She's usually very nice to me,

423
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,600
but she is very strict

424
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,280
when it comes to work.

425
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:23,760
She is very serious.

426
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,040
Are you afraid of her?

427
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:27,080
<i>To make sure you make it to probation,</i>

428
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,920
<i>I'll watch you closely this month.</i>

429
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,440
I'll leave first.

430
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,040
-Bye.
-Bye.

431
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,600
<i>Hello? Are you listening?</i>

432
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:44,840
Yes, Ms. He.

433
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,320
I am heading to the site now.

434
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,360
No.

435
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:49,720
Come back immediately and clock in.

436
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:53,400
Cong Xiao booked the photographer
to be in the showroom at 11:30 a.m.

437
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:56,160
As the assistant designer,
I must help out with the set.

438
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,200
I'm hanging up.

439
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,080
Hello...

440
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:07,120
If I hadn't promised He Canyang
to take care of you,

441
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,560
I wouldn't be bothered with you.

442
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,760
Cong Xiao booked the photographer?

443
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,840
Isn't it the same place?

444
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,680
No! Are you kidding me?

445
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,200
You can't tear off the happiness sticker.

446
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,160
Ms. Zhao.

447
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:47,520
When our company agreed to renovate
this place with the price of a showroom,

448
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:48,920
the contract stated that

449
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,640
you can't add any decorations
within three months.

450
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,720
Also, you need to cooperate with us
on client viewing

451
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,400
and commercials filming.

452
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,000
This is my house.

453
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:59,360
Is it illegal to put on
ribbons and stickers?

454
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,640
In our family tradition,

455
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,360
it's inauspicious to tear them off.

456
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,800
Can't you just edit the photo?

457
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:07,400
Of course,

458
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:10,960
but I have to send it to the ad agency
right after the shoot.

459
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:14,280
Also, it's impossible
to edit the photo in this condition.

460
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,680
May I take them off
and put them back later?

461
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,040
I don't care!

462
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:20,440
If anyone touches them,
I won't let this rest!

463
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,040
Ms. Zhao!

464
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:31,280
Ms. Zhao, listen to me!

465
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,480
Ms. Zhao!

466
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:34,960
He's an intern

467
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,160
and I am his superior.

468
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,360
I should've taught him better.
Let me apologize.

469
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:39,680
I'm sorry.

470
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,440
Stop pretending!

471
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,520
Is this how you treat your clients?

472
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,320
This is going too far!

473
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:47,440
I'll complain to your boss right now!

474
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:48,720
Just wait and see!

475
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,000
Hey.

476
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,200
Are you secretly cursing at me?

477
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:01,720
Good job.

478
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,000
What?

479
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,200
I twisted my waist.

480
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,280
It hurts!

481
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,920
No one was even measuring you.

482
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:26,520
Did you have to bow at a 90-degree angle?

483
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:31,040
<i>If you weren't handsome,
I would've beaten you to death.</i>

484
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:37,080
"If one wishes to rectify his heart,

485
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:39,600
one must first be sincere."

486
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,320
Our ancestors said so.

487
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:42,680
We must be sincere

488
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:44,240
when we apologize.

489
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:47,040
How old-fashioned.

490
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:49,480
What did you say?

491
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,480
I said that

492
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,400
you are especially beautiful today.

493
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,200
Why did you stop?

494
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,200
Do you think that I'm a masseur?

495
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,600
<i>What a jerk.</i>

496
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:31,280
<i>-If you weren't handsome, I'd--</i>
-Baby!

497
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,680
How did your dad find this lame firm?

498
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:36,280
That wretch was obviously coming at me!

499
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:37,880
Is it lame? I don't think so.

500
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,520
It's an expensive company.

501
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:40,440
Don't be mad.

502
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:42,200
That's him! He tore it!

503
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:44,000
-And she's an ally!
-Is that so?

504
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,720
I don't think that she's a bad person.
Look, she seems friendly

505
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,440
and she looks like my old...

506
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,160
He Fanxing.

507
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:19,920
He Fanxing!

508
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,360
What are you doing here?

509
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:33,800
<i>Compared to seeing him with his fiancée,</i>

510
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:36,480
<i>I'd rather meet</i>

511
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:40,840
<i>a 90-kg fat man.</i>

512
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:44,640
<i>Every destiny</i>

513
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:48,400
<i>begins with the fall
of a mysterious object.</i>

514
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,160
I'm sorry. I didn't mean...

515
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,440
You're He Fanxing.

516
00:27:58,920 --> 00:27:59,760
Am I right?

517
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:02,920
I know you.

518
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:05,680
You have never skipped class
since school began

519
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,960
and never joined any gatherings, right?

520
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,240
You are amazing!

521
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,200
I would always skip class,

522
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:15,000
but I never skipped any of the gatherings.

523
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:16,640
<i>INUYASHA</i>

524
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,040
Do you like dogs?

525
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,960
My favorite animal is a penguin.

526
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:24,120
My ambition is to be
an explorer at the South Pole.

527
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,720
I don't think you know me.

528
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,520
My name is Li Haomiao

529
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:28,920
and I think that you're quite cool.

530
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:29,880
Let's be friends.

531
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,920
<i>I'm sure</i>

532
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,520
<i>that I didn't like Li Haomiao back then,</i>

533
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,560
<i>nor did I want to be his friend.</i>

534
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:39,440
Oh, no!

535
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,280
Oh, no.

536
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:44,160
Why did my brick fall?

537
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:45,680
Are you sweeping?

538
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,040
Let me help you. Here.

539
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,240
-No!
-Let me!

540
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,120
-I'm fine!
-Don't worry!

541
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,440
Let me help you!

542
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,440
<i>Because Li Haomiao was a maniac.</i>

543
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:54,560
He Fanxing!

544
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:56,960
Here, I bought you some manga!

545
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,440
It's your favourite, <i>Inuyasha</i>.

546
00:28:58,520 --> 00:28:59,760
Let's go somewhere and read these.

547
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,120
<i>Clingy boys scare girls,</i>

548
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,160
<i>-even in a friendship!</i>
-Don't go!

549
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:17,880
<i>For a long time,</i>

550
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:21,840
<i>the existence of Li Haomiao
had replaced He Canyang.</i>

551
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:24,880
<i>We were both friends and playmates.</i>

552
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:29,200
<i>He was also my only guy friend in college.</i>

553
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:30,960
<i>It was</i>

554
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:33,480
<i>a very precious memory of my youth.</i>

555
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,640
<i>I couldn't help,</i>

556
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,880
<i>but fall for him.</i>

557
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:40,920
He Fanxing!

558
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,640
I'm going to the South Pole!

559
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,560
Hey, we're having a lesson.

560
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:47,720
Please leave.

561
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:50,000
He Fanxing, I don't want to leave you.

562
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,440
Promise me this.

563
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:54,800
If we were still to be single
after we have turned 35,

564
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,760
can we be together?

565
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,800
-Get together!
-Get together!

566
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,800
-Get together!
-Get together!

567
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:01,960
Can we?

568
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,680
<i>At the end of the memory,</i>

569
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:06,960
<i>I was possessed
by the female lead in a manga.</i>

570
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:07,920
<i>I said...</i>

571
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:08,880
Sure.

572
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:09,920
-Get him out!
-Get together!

573
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,760
-Get together!
-He Fanxing!

574
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,400
It's a promise!

575
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:16,280
Don't forget, you've promised me!
Don't you dare--

576
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,440
<i>For the past ten years,</i>

577
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:22,040
<i>I never met anyone
that made my heart beat,</i>

578
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:24,320
<i>who happened to be
my long-awaited first love.</i>

579
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:26,040
<i>That's why I've never forgotten</i>

580
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:27,880
<i>this promise.</i>

581
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:30,000
<i>I had also been very naive to believe</i>

582
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,680
<i>that it would forever be valid.</i>

583
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:32,600
He Fanxing!

584
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,000
I'm talking to you. Are you listening?

585
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:38,720
What were you saying?

586
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,760
I said that my fiancée is immature,

587
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,800
but I do like that
she has a willful personality.

588
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:50,800
<i>What an awful taste.</i>

589
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:53,880
Don't you think it's fate?

590
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,440
We promised to meet at 4:30 p.m.,

591
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:59,360
but it's not even afternoon
and yet here we are.

592
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,080
<i>Such an ill fate.</i>

593
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,440
It has been so long
that you must have forgotten me.

594
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:07,880
I even sent you photos
back at the South Pole.

595
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,920
After so long, you haven't changed.

596
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:13,200
You are still so pretty
even when you don't smile.

597
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:16,920
When did you come back?

598
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:19,440
About a week ago.

599
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,840
That's not the point. The point is,

600
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,080
once I returned,

601
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:24,040
I asked the class rep for your number.

602
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,160
Am I not sincere?

603
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:29,040
Didn't you say

604
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,920
that there isn't any female staff

605
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,440
at your base at the South Pole?

606
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:34,720
Right.

607
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,280
You know,

608
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:38,480
our team worked with a travel agency.

609
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,840
I was the local guide
and she went there to travel.

610
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,280
I didn't know what came over me.

611
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:47,800
The meaner she was,
the more I liked it, the more...

612
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:49,400
The more I like her.

613
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,680
<i>A total masochist.</i>

614
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,200
Enough about me.

615
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,120
How are you?

616
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:56,480
I am great.

617
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:57,960
Cut it out!

618
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:59,400
The class rep had already told me.

619
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:02,160
He said that we're the only ones
who are still single.

620
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,080
But now,

621
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:05,240
you are the only one.

622
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:11,800
First, let me make it clear.

623
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:15,640
Even though Li Haomiao
is your director's college friend,

624
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,280
it's not related to you at all.

625
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,840
I will still file a complaint against you.

626
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,600
You are quite a woman with principle.

627
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:23,400
What's his name again?

628
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,040
Li Haomiao.

629
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,960
He lived at the South Pole for ten years

630
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:29,120
and an expert who studies the ecosystem.

631
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:32,240
<i>I wouldn't believe it
if it were someone else.</i>

632
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,240
But He Fanxing is an alien,

633
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:36,080
while Li Haomiao is a weirdo.

634
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:39,000
They are made for each other,
and they can definitely make this happen.

635
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:47,480
Are you sure someone has seen
a young lady took him from Ningxia Road?

636
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,080
Yes.

637
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:51,120
A notice has already been posted
at that bus stop.

638
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:54,280
If she wanted to send the dog back,

639
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:58,560
she should have called
when she saw the notice on the signs.

640
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:00,840
But she didn't,

641
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,240
which means she didn't want to return him.

642
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,480
Make a stamp for me.

643
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:07,600
A big one.

644
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:08,840
Carve the words,

645
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,680
"Hefty reward."

646
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,520
-Okay.
-What time is it now?

647
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,280
Half-past one.

648
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,320
If they don't send in
the new photos by 2:30 p.m.,

649
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,280
tell the magazine company to proceed.

650
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,480
Print with the available content.

651
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:26,080
Understood,
I will inform Amazing Decoration.

652
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,320
I have to take the call.

653
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,600
Please take a look first.

654
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:41,920
Hello.

655
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:44,360
What?

656
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:45,880
It's not delivered yet?

657
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:49,120
It might be due to the traffic jam.

658
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,040
Hold on, I'll give her a call.

659
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:59,680
All the baby seals

660
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,760
and baby penguins that we saved
were adorable.

661
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,200
They were not afraid of humans at all.

662
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:05,080
You saw the photos I sent, right?

663
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:09,440
Am I talking too much?

664
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,440
You said that

665
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:18,280
your palms froze to the cup,

666
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:21,120
and you talked about the emperor penguin

667
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,880
and baby seals.

668
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:24,800
Yes.

669
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,040
So did you ask me to come here

670
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,920
to tell me these things?

671
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:30,240
Of course not.

672
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:33,080
There is something important
that I have to tell you.

673
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,000
Guess what this is.

674
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,560
My wedding invitation.

675
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:45,360
I am giving it to you personally.

676
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:46,760
How's that for sincerity?

677
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,720
We haven't seen each other for so long.

678
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,480
Who knew that when we finally met,

679
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,120
I would be receiving
your wedding invitation.

680
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,320
Congratulations.

681
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,880
So, He Fanxing, do your best.

682
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:12,520
Find someone suitable

683
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:14,800
and settle down.

684
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:17,480
Don't be picky just because you're pretty.

685
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,160
Someone suitable?

686
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:27,000
People around me always say that.

687
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,280
But I didn't expect

688
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:32,000
to hear those words from you.

689
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,480
I do remember

690
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:36,840
that you used to talk

691
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,560
about dreams,

692
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:40,320
somewhere far away,

693
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,840
and a sky full of stars.

694
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,560
You hated

695
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,600
the word "suitable" the most.

696
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,240
Youth is wonderful.

697
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:57,320
But we are in our 30s.

698
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:58,520
As humans,

699
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,680
we have to be realistic.

700
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:03,480
Do you remember what I said

701
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,120
back in college,

702
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:06,800
in the class?

703
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:08,640
I told you

704
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,840
that if we were still to be single

705
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:13,840
once we have reached 35,

706
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:15,360
we would be together.

707
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:20,720
We would only believe
that kind of thing at that age.

708
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:23,680
That's true.

709
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,120
<i>I believed it.</i>

710
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,760
<i>I kept believing it.</i>

711
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:32,800
<i>I thought it didn't matter
if I don't meet guys I like.</i>

712
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:34,880
<i>I still had that promise at 35.</i>

713
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:36,640
<i>It was beautiful and romantic.</i>

714
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:40,960
<i>I thought I would have
the most beautiful first love story ever.</i>

715
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,640
<i>I was looking forward to it,</i>

716
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,840
<i>but now I am dumped on the side
of the road like an idiot.</i>

717
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:48,120
One more thing.

718
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,200
We are getting married,

719
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:53,000
but my girlfriend couldn't find
a suitable bridesmaid.

720
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:54,680
Check if you have the time.

721
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:56,520
If you can, do help us out.

722
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:00,000
Why are you still thinking about it?
Aren't we friends?

723
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:02,280
I can even give you a big red envelope.

724
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:03,200
Just say it!

725
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,440
Of course.

726
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,520
Well, you were my best friend

727
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:12,880
back in college.

728
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:14,000
See.

729
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:24,280
Since your director
has agreed to be my bridesmaid,

730
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:25,440
I will forgive you.

731
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:27,520
I will consider it as a good deed

732
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:29,160
for my wedding.

733
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:50,760
Why are you here?

734
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,080
Oh, you came here with me.

735
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:56,640
It's settled now.

736
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:57,680
Go back to the site.

737
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,480
-What is it?
-Are you all right?

738
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:04,400
What a strange question.

739
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:05,680
Why wouldn't I be?

740
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:06,880
Go.

741
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,040
-To Xian Dai Cheng, please.
-Sure.

742
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:38,360
Come in.

743
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:43,720
Mr. Ye.

744
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,840
This is the annual ad pitch
for the airline.

745
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:46,880
Please take a look.

746
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:58,560
It is quite good.

747
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:00,120
A new aircraft model.

748
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:01,720
Bigger capacity.

749
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,720
How much is the aircraft seller paying us

750
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,600
that you are working so hard?

751
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:14,560
Is the airline company selling aircraft?

752
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:29,640
Hi, excuse me.

753
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:32,040
Sorry, we're taking photos,
can you wait for a moment?

754
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:33,880
Face each other.

755
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:35,400
Act sweet towards each other.

756
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:36,360
That's right.

757
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,360
Great.

758
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:39,960
Bride, give me a big smile.

759
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:42,120
<i>I am a 32-year-old woman.</i>

760
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:44,680
<i>But I still desire true love</i>

761
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:47,080
<i>instead of settling for someone suitable.</i>

762
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,120
<i>Am I wrong?</i>

763
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,960
Okay, thank you. You may go ahead now.

764
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:58,840
Okay, bigger smile.

765
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,480
This one is not bad.

766
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:08,920
<i>I am not wrong.</i>

767
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:12,440
<i>There is no right or wrong in life.</i>

768
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:21,600
Do it again!

769
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:28,240
<i>I want to feel the type of love</i>

770
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:30,280
<i>that makes my day
just by holding each other's hands.</i>

771
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:33,160
<i>We'll stay up all night
just to talk over the phone.</i>

772
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:35,680
<i>The type that fills my stomach
with butterflies</i>

773
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:38,320
<i>and makes my heart flutter.</i>

774
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:41,920
<i>The type of love
that makes him glow among the crowd.</i>

775
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:45,720
<i>Like the unforgettable love
that one feels at 17.</i>

776
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:47,840
<i>It will definitely come!</i>

777
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:49,480
<i>Definitely.</i>

778
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:16,800
Ma'am.

779
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:17,920
Ma'am.

780
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:21,040
Ma'am, is this your puppy?

781
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:22,560
So adorable.

782
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:24,280
So cute!

783
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:27,040
It looks like Roy Wang's Dudu.

784
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:30,480
Ma'am, what's the name of your poodle?

785
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,160
I don't know. I don't know him.

786
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:36,520
Ma'am.

787
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:38,240
Call me, "Miss".

788
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:45,400
Only high school girls can be called miss.

789
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:48,520
She is already working,
shouldn't we call her ma'am?

790
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:50,240
She's just like my sister.

791
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:52,920
She is over 30,
but still obsessed with Lu Han.

792
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:54,560
Is she over 30?

793
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:55,760
That's so old!

794
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:58,320
Yes, she has no self-respect.

795
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:59,680
She bullies me all the time.

796
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:01,760
