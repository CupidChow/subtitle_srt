1
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,400
Melon, what are you doing?

2
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,680
Let's get to work.

3
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,000
I took some photos to be posted
on WeChat Moment.

4
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:11,000
It's so much fun.

5
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,920
So many kids came to see me.

6
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,080
It was fun, right?

7
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,160
That's good.

8
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,320
Our mission today is to give out flyers
in front of the restaurant,

9
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,360
take photos with people,
and play with kids.

10
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,520
I like to take photos with people!

11
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,080
Look at me.

12
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,000
Do I look funny?

13
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,840
As long as you're happy.

14
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,520
Hurry, let's get to work.

15
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,680
Let's go.

16
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,840
Here.

17
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,120
This is cooling.

18
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,480
How do you feel?

19
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,360
We'll continue after a ten-minute break.

20
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,280
What?

21
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,520
It's so hot being stuffed
in this mascot suit.

22
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,680
It has been almost an hour.
We're almost done for the morning, right?

23
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,440
It's only 10:30 a.m.!

24
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,080
We have to work until 12 p.m.

25
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:27,600
Another hour and a half?

26
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,160
Hey.

27
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,560
There's nothing easy in the adults' world.

28
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,760
Come in.

29
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,080
I just finished a meeting with Mr. Li.

30
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,120
Let's have lunch together?

31
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,200
Sure.

32
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,920
I heard that you're tying the knot soon?

33
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,160
No.

34
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:15,160
Everyone has been asking me
this question lately.

35
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,320
This rumor has gotten out of hand.

36
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,440
Didn't you already go
on a house viewing together?

37
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,080
I was just keeping him company.

38
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,240
Some women require a feeling of impulse
to get married.

39
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,640
When I decided to marry Yuan Song's dad,

40
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,840
I was also madly in love.

41
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,200
I thought you were the same.

42
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,160
I'm waiting for
that impulsive feeling too,

43
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,320
but I have yet to feel it.

44
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,400
Did you feel it with Yuan Song?

45
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,000
I'm sorry.

46
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,080
You should apologize.

47
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,240
I think you were unfair to Yuan Song.

48
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,040
When you two were together,

49
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,480
you didn't fully commit yourself.

50
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,160
You cared too much
about what others think.

51
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,520
But I couldn't help it.

52
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,400
I understand.

53
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,080
Humans are gregarious.

54
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:27,320
The main reason you couldn't fully commit
was because you thought

55
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,520
your relationship wouldn't last.

56
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:33,680
So you didn't want to face
other people's opinions

57
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,240
towards a short-lived relationship.

58
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,240
As for Yuan Song,

59
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,720
he doesn't know how to manage

60
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,880
a long-lasting and stable relationship.

61
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,760
He's too young.

62
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:47,160
To him, his plans couldn't keep up
with the changes that were happening.

63
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,040
He was just enjoying the moment.

64
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:54,360
So you two made many mistakes.

65
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,840
If we were both wrong,

66
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,560
one of us must have committed
greater mistakes.

67
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,200
It was me.

68
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,560
I'm older,

69
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,840
so I should have been more forgiving.

70
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,160
You should have trusted him

71
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,760
and given him time to grow.

72
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:20,680
Then--

73
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,280
He will surely meet someone

74
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,280
who is more compatible with him than me.

75
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,280
I never expected

76
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,360
that I would think of compatibility

77
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,280
as something that comes naturally one day.

78
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,400
Of course.

79
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,200
Most people would think
that an embedded type of relationship

80
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,440
is the most stable and safest one.

81
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:53,080
A key to a lock, a pot to a lid,

82
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,720
a man to a woman.

83
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,440
But how is compatibility related to love?

84
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:00,160
Even if you don't look
compatible together,

85
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,520
Yuan Song still tried to get close to you

86
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:06,760
and you tried your best to resist
being attracted to him.

87
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,600
Yet you couldn't deny it.

88
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,360
That is love.

89
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:22,960
Ye Luming is a nice guy.

90
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,440
We're compatible.

91
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,560
My parents like him too.

92
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,480
I think

93
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:34,520
I have never met anyone
who is more compatible with me than him.

94
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:39,120
If things go well

95
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,400
and we get married,

96
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,120
we should be very happy.

97
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:49,760
So?

98
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,600
I'm just a normal person...

99
00:07:55,480 --> 00:08:00,280
and compatibility is a choice
made by those who are normal

100
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:05,320
after considering the pros and cons
in order to live a carefree life.

101
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,400
So...

102
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,640
I want to develop feelings
with a compatible man

103
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,400
and live like a normal person.

104
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,080
On the contrary,

105
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,280
I think a carefree life

106
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:27,000
is the ultimate dream

107
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,800
on the premise that it's achievable.

108
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,080
I was just curious.

109
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,600
Let's end the topic here.

110
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:39,800
Help yourself.

111
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,520
<i>Ten minutes left before I get off work.</i>

112
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,120
<i>Do you want Spanish or French
for dinner tonight?</i>

113
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,600
<i>I have to visit a colleague
at the hospital tonight.</i>

114
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,600
<i>Should I come with you?</i>

115
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,360
<i>I'm going with other colleagues.</i>

116
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:14,480
<i>Then tomorrow at noon, Spanish or French?</i>

117
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,760
Let's go, He Fanxing.

118
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:22,920
Okay.

119
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,800
Huanhuan told me
that his boss treats him well.

120
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:02,600
Now that I see you,
you are very pretty too.

121
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,400
I'm not, Mrs. Chang. Stop praising me.

122
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,000
Why are you being humble? You're pretty.

123
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,680
It has been hard on you, Xiaoxiao.

124
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,360
You have helped me a lot.

125
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,520
You took turns with me
in taking care of Huanhuan.

126
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:19,440
It's nothing, Mrs. Chang.

127
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,960
You don't have to worry about it.

128
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:21,880
Yes, Mom.

129
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,480
She would usually kick me.

130
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:26,280
Therefore, she should take care of me
when I'm sick.

131
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,560
Did you do something wrong to get kicked?

132
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:30,840
No, Mom.

133
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,000
Of course, he did.

134
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:35,200
You have no idea how lazy he is every day.

135
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:37,600
He looks like he's sleepwalking at work.

136
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,400
If I hadn't kicked his chair,

137
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,880
Ms. He would have deducted his salary

138
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,920
and he wouldn't be able to pay
for his house loan.

139
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:47,120
Xiaoxiao, please do me a favor
and kick him more.

140
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,680
-Of course.
-Mom!

141
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:51,200
Can you hear that?
She wants me to kick you more.

142
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,160
One is Huanhuan,
while the other is Xiaoxiao.

143
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,440
What a perfect match.

144
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,280
Hey.

145
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,040
Why don't you get married?

146
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,600
-Yuan Song!
-What are you talking about?

147
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,520
Be careful, son.

148
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:18,560
-Come, let's go.
-We want to play! It's a bear!

149
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,480
Minmin!

150
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:21,920
Minmin!

151
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,480
Minmin!

152
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,600
What's wrong?

153
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,680
Hang on, we'll be off work soon.

154
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:36,720
What is it?

155
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:37,720
I...

156
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,840
-I have to go to the toilet!
-Hey!

157
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,120
Hey!

158
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,680
I won't make it!

159
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,720
I won't make it in time!

160
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,880
Help, Zhanni!

161
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:56,880
It's coming out!

162
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,560
-I'm coming!
-Zhanni!

163
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,960
Hurry!

164
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,680
Hurry up!

165
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,240
Hurry!

166
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,080
Hey.

167
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,680
It feels like Chang Huan's mom
treats you like her daughter-in-law.

168
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,440
It's because I'm lovable.

169
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,360
What's wrong with that?

170
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,800
It's nothing, congratulations.

171
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:27,280
When did you two go into couple mode?

172
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:30,080
One peeled the orange
and the other ate it.

173
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,400
One serves the food and the other eats.

174
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,120
Can't we be close?

175
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,280
Of course, you can.

176
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:39,640
Are you sure
you're not captivated by Ms. He?

177
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:44,960
I'm sure Ms. He looks really attractive
to young boys like you.

178
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,440
Of course.

179
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,640
She's the girl of my dreams.

180
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,600
Did you hear that?

181
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,160
Will you consider him?

182
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,880
Are you guys going to eat or not?

183
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,720
Okay, I'll stop joking.

184
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,480
You have Mr. Ye.

185
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,680
Mr. Ye is pursuing you so avidly.

186
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:05,640
I bet that he will have you within a year.

187
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,200
Doesn't he have her already?

188
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,360
What else should he do?

189
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,400
Lock her away?

190
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:13,880
What I meant is that
Mr. Ye's family seems anxious

191
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,440
and they're very pleased with Ms. He too.

192
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,120
They would want them to get married soon.

193
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,760
He's already 37.

194
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,640
He must be anxious to have children.

195
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,440
Let's not talk about this topic right now.

196
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,160
Don't avoid the topic.

197
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,120
Let me give you some advice as a friend.

198
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,520
It's good to be pregnant earlier.

199
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:35,440
The air quality is not good now,
the same goes with the quality of food.

200
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:38,240
Watch out for early ovarian aging.

201
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,320
If early pregnancy is good,

202
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,280
shouldn't you support the college kids
to do so?

203
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,400
Their workload isn't heavy
and they have good stamina.

204
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:48,200
They can focus on work after giving birth
and graduating from school.

205
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:51,160
Those who are poor can have one,
those who are rich can have two.

206
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,120
Don't we have to watch out
for ovarian aging?

207
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,360
Are you nuts?

208
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,800
Why are you suddenly being sarcastic?

209
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,360
It's because what you said isn't right.

210
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,920
It doesn't comply
with core socialist values.

211
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,760
First, it violates freedom and equality.

212
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,320
It's a form of abduction
and mental stress.

213
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,720
"Abduction"?

214
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,280
Good advice is unpleasant to the ears.

215
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,680
It's unpleasant indeed,
but it's not good advice.

216
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,320
I didn't realize
that you're so argumentative.

217
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,000
Why are you so agitated?

218
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:20,120
Do you really have a secret crush
on Ms. He?

219
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,320
Yes, I have a secret crush on her.

220
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,440
So it is true.

221
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,000
Are you serious?

222
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,080
Cong Xiao, please pay the bill.

223
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,520
-Come with me, Yuan Song.
-What?

224
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
What?

225
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,120
Hey, don't tell anyone about this.

226
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,280
I'll buy you a meal next time.

227
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,440
Okay.

228
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,000
Fine.

229
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,400
I was too agitated earlier.

230
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,200
Scold me if you're mad,
but don't leave me hanging.

231
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,360
Look.

232
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,320
You always have
this facial expression lately.

233
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,680
If there's something you can't figure out,
just say it.

234
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,240
Why do you keep silent?

235
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,280
I have passed the age of being outspoken.

236
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:47,080
I always think that I live in the past.

237
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,200
Everyone's time is moving forward.

238
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,560
Just like how the seasons change

239
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,600
and how crops are planted,
grown, then harvested.

240
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,200
I am the only one who remains where I am
and refuses to grow.

241
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:07,240
I even have the desire
to get into useless relationships.

242
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,280
I keep useless hobbies

243
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,680
and never reconciled.

244
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:14,960
I'm unconventional and independent.

245
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,840
I thought I was special.

246
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,000
But in fact,

247
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,840
I am just an average girl
who is selfish and weak.

248
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:29,040
I don't understand what you mean.

249
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,640
In words, I said I'll follow my heart,

250
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:40,120
but in my actions,
I have been calculating the pros and cons.

251
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,320
I want a carefree life.

252
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,600
But how can things be carefree
in this world?

253
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,000
I'm just running from reality.

254
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:56,800
It's shameful

255
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:58,720
and useless too.

256
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,720
Isn't there such a saying?

257
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,000
"Humans...

258
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,400
often end up living the way
they hate the most."

259
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,920
I am not in the mood for your jokes.

260
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,240
Scold me if you're mad.

261
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,080
But I'm not sorry!

262
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,400
I don't want to go back to being friends.

263
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,240
I was lying when I said that.

264
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,440
How can you be stupid enough
to believe a man's words?

265
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:29,160
I came back to work
because I can't accept it.

266
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,480
I want to hang around you
and win you back.

267
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,840
I never planned
to let you be with someone else.

268
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:36,600
I don't care how hard it is for you,
how much your parents like him,

269
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,360
or how compatible you are.

270
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,040
I will never back down.

271
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,920
I won't wish you two well either.

272
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,720
I like you.

273
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:45,960
So what?

274
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,960
I like you. Am I not allowed to do so?

275
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,000
I know.

276
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,120
What do you know? You know nothing!

277
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:59,240
You don't know how serious I am,
how clear this is for me,

278
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:01,880
how important you are,
and how much I like you.

279
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,720
It's different now.

280
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,640
I want to face everything
in the future with you.

281
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,720
But we can't do that.

282
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:12,160
"No", "We can't", "It's not good."

283
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,000
Why are you so used to saying, "No"?

284
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,400
From now on, say that you can.

285
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,000
Say yes!

286
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:23,240
Say that it's good! Say that you like me!

287
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:26,920
Yuan Song.

288
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,360
Calm down.

289
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:32,840
Listen to me, okay?

290
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:42,720
I know

291
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,280
that I am always in your heart.

292
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,800
I know that you cherish me.

293
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:51,920
So do I.

294
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:59,440
I even enjoy your attention.

295
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,800
My mind tells me
that we should keep our distance.

296
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,200
But in my heart...

297
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:18,440
I still enjoy flirting
and the feelings that remain between us.

298
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,520
I have been fighting with myself

299
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,440
and both sides have lost greatly.

300
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,320
But we can't go on this way.

301
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,120
It's too tiring.

302
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,360
Do you know how wrong this is?

303
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:42,960
You admitted it.

304
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,240
You still like me.

305
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,520
But I can't risk it.

306
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,840
I used to think

307
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,800
that I could ignore
other people's opinions.

308
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:06,560
But when it really happened to me,
I realized...

309
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,600
that I wasn't as brave as I thought.

310
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,840
So I kept backing down...

311
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,600
until I was willing
to try dating Ye Luming.

312
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,800
Still, I never tried hard enough.

313
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:30,320
Every time he moves forward, I back off.

314
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,720
It's not fair to him.

315
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,360
Besides,

316
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:44,520
I want to find a way out for my heart.

317
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,600
You said that you like me,

318
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:51,840
yet you're asking me to let go?

319
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,200
I'll repeat what I said.

320
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,360
Stop it!

321
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:00,600
I understand it very well.

322
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,560
You're very weak indeed.

323
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,440
A two-faced coward.

324
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,920
So stop wasting time on me.

325
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:17,760
I'll get going.

326
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:32,680
Fine.

327
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,880
I can't stop liking you now.

328
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,760
I have decided to love you one-sidedly.

329
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,800
You can ignore me.

330
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,920
Hey, you've been staring at it
for a whole day.

331
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,600
Does a 200-yuan bill have gold outlines?

332
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:05,840
This is my first hard-earned money.

333
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,360
I really thought
that I would die from heat

334
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:10,160
or suffocation in the mascot suit.

335
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:13,280
Today is more tiring
than a whole year combined

336
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,920
and I only earned 200 yuan.

337
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,960
It turns out that money
is so hard to earn.

338
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:19,520
That's right.

339
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,960
Giving out flyers in a mascot suit
is very tiring.

340
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:27,520
But to part-timers like us,
earning 200 yuan a day is a lot.

341
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,440
We're also being paid daily,
so it's really worth it!

342
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:35,320
How do you and Big Head endure it?

343
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,200
We think about our parents.

344
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:42,080
If we can support ourselves,
then they can relax a little.

345
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:46,480
Eventually, after graduation,
we still have to support ourselves, right?

346
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:53,000
Do we really have to depend
on ourselves to survive?

347
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:56,440
Yes, I think so.

348
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:58,600
One's confidence lies

349
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,760
in having other people's support
when he falls.

350
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:03,960
You have your parents and uncle's support.

351
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,680
But have you thought about this?

352
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:08,600
What if they were to fall one day
and there's no one to support you?

353
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,680
Zhanni.

354
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,400
You're so mature.

355
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,240
I never thought about these things before.

356
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,680
That's normal.

357
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,760
Don't worry, you will grow up.

358
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:24,640
I told my uncle that I'm a waitress
and I earn 8,000 yuan a month.

359
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:28,080
Your uncle had to know
it was a lie from the get-go.

360
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,440
It's so ridiculous.

361
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,040
You should tell him the truth.

362
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,880
Why did I lie?

363
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:37,960
Serves you right.

364
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,800
This is my first bucket of gold.

365
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,240
I have to spend it on the people I love.

366
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,840
What should I buy for Uncle and Ms. He?

367
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,520
With 200 yuan?

368
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,920
Buy some decor in a boutique.

369
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:59,880
This 200 yuan is my hard-earned money.

370
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:01,960
Do you want me to buy cheap plastics?

371
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,200
Buy them a meal then.

372
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:07,280
But you can't go to expensive places.

373
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,120
Burgers and coke will do.

374
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,520
Then this will all be gone.

375
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,040
What else can you do with 200 yuan?

376
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:27,320
Why don't you work for a few more days
and earn 1,000 or 800 yen?

377
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,080
You might be able to buy
a shirt or something.

378
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,840
But if you want to buy
a tie clip or cufflinks,

379
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:36,120
you might need to stay here
for the entire summer.

380
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:38,960
Forget it.

381
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,280
Forget what I said.

382
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:43,000
I bet you don't want to see
that mascot suit again.

383
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:19,920
<i>Why don't we eat Spanish food tomorrow?</i>

384
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,040
You're home.

385
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,160
Uncle.

386
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:54,480
Yes.

387
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:57,040
I went to work today.

388
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,080
Did you see my WeChat Moment?

389
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,200
I did.

390
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,960
Don't you work every day?

391
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,240
No.

392
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,120
I lied.

393
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,280
I...

394
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,760
I didn't go home
so that I can go on dates.

395
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,960
I shouldn't have lied.

396
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,960
Why did you work today then?

397
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:45,320
My classmate had a driving test,
so I replaced him.

398
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,640
How did you feel?

399
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,120
Very tiring.

400
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,680
It's hard to earn money.

401
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,480
I spent so much money

402
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:58,760
on useless things.

403
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:01,680
I have been eating good food
and wearing nice clothes.

404
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,600
God knows how much effort you'll need
to earn the money back.

405
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:09,080
It's stuffy and hot
in the mascot suit, right?

406
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:13,520
I can smell your stench from here.

407
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,240
I'm the one who is in the wrong, Uncle.

408
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:23,800
Hit me.

409
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,160
Tell me.

410
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,520
Why am I mad at you?

411
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,200
Why?

412
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:40,880
It's because I lied to you.

413
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:44,440
I'm mad because you lied
to your family for a man.

414
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,400
Stretch out your hand.

415
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:52,600
You're an adult now.

416
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:55,360
You need to learn
and be responsible for yourself.

417
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:57,920
You admitted your mistake.

418
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,840
It means that you're not that dumb
to deserve to be hit.

419
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,160
Go take a bath.

420
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
This is for you.

421
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,280
What is it?

422
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,720
I can't buy anything

423
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,960
with my first hard-earned money.

424
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,600
In the future,

425
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,040
I'll buy you something nice.

426
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,880
100 YUAN

427
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:18,600
<i>Okay, see you tomorrow.</i>

428
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:47,480
Fanxing!

429
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:48,680
Hey!

430
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,760
Is Xiaoyu going to give birth prematurely?

431
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:51,960
I don't think so.

432
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:53,520
Let's go.

433
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:55,400
Don't worry, Fanfan.

434
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,640
I already called Song Xue and Fanxing.

435
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,320
You can come after work.

436
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,960
If she gives birth, it will be tonight.

437
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,360
Okay.

438
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:04,720
That's all.

439
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:07,840
How do you feel?

440
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,960
Do you feel anything?

441
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:11,360
What did he say?

442
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,360
He's with a client.

443
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:14,840
He'll come once he is done.

444
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:18,240
Xiaoyu!

445
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,200
-Mrs. Yang.
-You're here.

446
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:21,440
How's Xiaoyu?

447
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:23,800
The doctor told her to walk more
so she can give birth easier.

448
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:27,200
I need to rush home to pack.
A lot of her things aren't here yet.

449
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,000
Okay, we'll take care of her here.

450
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:30,000
Don't worry, Mrs. Yang.

451
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:31,200
Canyang is coming.

452
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:33,080
-I'll get going, Xiaoyu.
-Okay.

453
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,400
Hold this.

454
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,240
-Thank you.
-Take care, Mrs. Yang.

455
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,400
How are you?

456
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:40,600
Should we take a walk?

457
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:42,840
Come.

458
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,360
Song Xue.

459
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:47,320
Come here.

460
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,680
Be careful.

461
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:57,400
Be careful.

462
00:31:58,440 --> 00:31:59,880
Take it slow, don't rush.

463
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,600
It's just a short distance.

464
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:05,440
During my pregnancy,
I don't live like a queen.

465
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:07,760
No one served me.

466
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:11,320
I do the household chores
and take care of Peanut.

467
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:12,600
I...

468
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,120
-Hey.
-Hey.

469
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:16,960
How do you feel?

470
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,320
Be careful.

471
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,760
In recent months,

472
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:35,400
he had an affair

473
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,520
and felt guilty.

474
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,320
He totally changed.

475
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,600
He did all the chores at home.

476
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,920
Since you have decided
to forgive and stay with him,

477
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,520
stop saying these things.

478
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,080
It's bad for your relationship.

479
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,480
I made you angry last time.

480
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,080
And I was so dumb.

481
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:56,360
-Why do you still care?
-I won't after you give birth.

482
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:57,760
Gosh.

483
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,720
Why are you mad at Xiaoyu?

484
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:03,920
You know how outspoken and imperious
she is towards her friends.

485
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:06,600
That's right.

486
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:08,440
Are you really mad?

487
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,280
I'll apologize to you.

488
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:11,920
Who wants your apology?

489
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:17,120
Even though you're dumb,
some of your words made sense.

490
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:18,800
I should have given it more thought.

491
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:21,680
But it has nothing to do with Fanxing.

492
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:22,760
She didn't know.

493
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:24,880
Who says it has nothing to do with me?

494
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,000
I was the impulsive one.

495
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:29,640
I took you to see Xiaoyu.

496
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,320
I threw the coffee too.

497
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:34,120
I even hit him.

498
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,200
Did you hit him?

499
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,840
Gosh, take it slow.

500
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,000
Don't be agitated.

501
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:53,080
Are you okay?

502
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,240
He Fanxing.

503
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,120
I'm right about you.

504
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:01,880
Professor Song.

505
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,840
You're just a paper tiger.

506
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,600
What do you mean, Yang Xiaoyu?

507
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:11,840
Don't tell me you didn't divorce
Shen Fanfan just for revenge?

508
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,320
No.

509
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:20,120
Back then, I was just trying

510
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,040
to get through these few years
and see what happens.

511
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,440
Actually...

512
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,400
Among the three of us,

513
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,800
I was the first to find out.

514
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:38,680
That was three months ago.

515
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:44,680
Peanut, you're playing
with Dad's phone again.

516
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:46,280
He'll be angry.

517
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:49,680
Give it to me.

518
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:53,480
Mom, I want to play Taptap!

519
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:55,120
Play with mine then.

520
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:57,760
Here.

521
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:58,840
Play on your own.

522
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:10,080
DAD

523
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,000
You're just in time.

524
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:15,960
Dad is calling.

525
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:20,840
Why does your dad call so often lately
and talk so long with you?

526
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:24,920
Aside from scolding me,
what else can he say?

527
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:26,440
I'll take it inside.

528
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:34,120
-Do you play this well?
-Yes.

529
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,880
Let Mom answer the call first.

530
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:46,120
FATHER-IN-LAW

531
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,040
Hi, Dad.

532
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:02,440
<i>I read an article online</i>

533
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,400
<i>saying that women look upon men</i>

534
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:08,160
<i>like teachers standing on the podium
and seeing students cheat.</i>

535
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,880
<i>You can see it very clearly.</i>

536
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:12,280
His energy at home

537
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:14,280
was getting weaker and weaker.

538
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:15,760
He was quiet

539
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:18,440
and kept zoning out.

540
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:22,200
He contained his joy so hard
when he was looking at his phone.

541
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:26,440
If you were to call out
his name back then,

542
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:29,120
it was like waking him up from his dream.

543
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:35,200
Doesn't everyone's facial expression
look similar when they're in love?

544
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,440
But you kept it to yourself.

545
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:42,160
Why didn't you tell us?

546
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:46,040
Do you really think
that we'll force you to divorce him?

547
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,720
I felt embarrassed.

548
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:57,440
Why do my friends live so well,

549
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:59,920
the way I want to live myself,

550
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,600
but I lead such a sad life?

551
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:06,600
I don't even dare to leave my man.

552
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:10,320
I never wanted to let you know.

553
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,760
But I know that deep inside,

554
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:17,680
how worried and sad you guys are
for my sake.

555
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:19,840
However,

556
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:23,000
when you guys brought him to me,

557
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:27,600
any pride that's left in me was all gone.

558
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,640
I'm sorry then.

559
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:34,160
Goodness, I was wrong.

560
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,960
Are you really angry at me?

561
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:40,720
I really regret treating
you guys that way.

562
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,440
I learned my lesson too.

563
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:46,040
The past few days
have been really hard on me.

564
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:48,920
It was even harder
than when he cheated on me.

565
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,400
Then you should control yourself.

566
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:53,480
I can't!

567
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:57,240
That's why I need you to teach me,
Professor Song.

568
00:37:58,800 --> 00:37:59,760
Look.

569
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:01,720
After talking with you two,

570
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,280
my tummy doesn't hurt anymore.

571
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:06,520
Stop being a smartass.

572
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:08,200
You two are still arguing
at a time like this.

573
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,640
How can she be mad at you?

574
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:12,560
I know.

575
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:14,760
Neither can you.

576
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:19,640
You're the sweetheart dean with a whip.

577
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:23,280
What kind of weird movie
did you watch again?

578
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:25,680
That's enough, you two.

579
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:26,800
Be serious.

580
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:29,360
-Xiaoyu.
-Yes?

581
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:32,840
No matter what decision you make,
we will always support you.

582
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:34,760
That's right.

583
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:36,280
What can I do?

584
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:39,280
I knew you were dumb
from the first time we met.

585
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:44,240
Three hours ago, I was thinking

586
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:46,160
that without love,

587
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:48,920
our marriage can still be sustained
with kinship.

588
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:52,080
Aside from not loving me,

589
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:55,280
Shen Fanfan is not bad.

590
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:59,120
He gives me his pay
and treats Peanut well.

591
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,320
What else can I ask for?

592
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,200
Well...

593
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:11,280
Those who live depending on others

594
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:14,800
really keep lowering
their expectations in life.

595
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:18,920
If I keep going on this way,

596
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:23,680
will I become less and less humane?

597
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:26,120
-What are you talking about?
-You won't.

598
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:29,720
-Does it hurt again?
-Let's go.

599
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,400
Let's sit on the bench over there.

600
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,520
-Be careful.
-Take it slow.

601
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:35,560
Be careful.

602
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:39,880
-It's okay.
-Take it slow.

603
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:48,480
Are you all right?

604
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,000
I'm fine.

605
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:56,280
However, I am cunning too.

606
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:59,440
They didn't dare to use Wechat,

607
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:01,680
but used new QQ IDs to message each other.

608
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:03,520
During the past few months,

609
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:06,600
I downloaded all their chat records.

610
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:08,960
But I didn't dare to read through them.

611
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:11,600
Until this morning.

612
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:15,160
My curiosity

613
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:18,680
won over my rationality.

614
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:23,480
Dear.

615
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:26,040
Just leave it. Mom is coming over soon.

616
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:27,400
Okay.

617
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:31,440
By the way, I'm meeting a client tonight.

618
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:32,560
I'll be back late.

619
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:35,840
Okay.

620
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:50,360
I'm really meeting a client.

621
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:52,080
I'll send you my location.

622
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:53,920
I believe you.

623
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,480
Dear, I have really changed.

624
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:00,600
All right.

625
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,600
Peanut will be late.

626
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:04,840
Go.

627
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:08,840
I'll get going, dear.

628
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:14,200
Come, Peanut.

629
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:15,280
Leave the doll.

630
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:19,360
-Say goodbye to Mom.
-Bye, Mom.

631
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:21,800
-Bye, sweetheart.
-Let's go.

632
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,120
We'll get going, dear.

633
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:41,240
<i>You're so beautiful today.</i>

634
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:42,560
<i>I'm at home.</i>

635
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:44,240
<i>I really want to see you.</i>

636
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:45,480
<i>Love you, baby.</i>

637
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:48,000
<i>I'll take Peanut to the studio today. </i>

638
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:49,280
<i>She can be my cover.</i>

639
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:51,320
<i>Peanut really likes you.</i>

640
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:54,920
<i>I no longer love my wife.</i>

641
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:58,000
<i>We're doing this for our child.</i>

642
00:41:58,120 --> 00:42:00,200
<i>Even if there's no love,
we still have our responsibilities.</i>

643
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,240
<i>I quarreled with her today.</i>

644
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:03,880
<i>What a crazy woman.</i>

645
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:06,680
<i>I was so dumb to date her
when I was young.</i>

646
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:08,720
<i>You're so modest.</i>

647
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:11,200
<i>If it were my wife,
she would even swallow the bowl.</i>

648
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:13,040
<i>She needs to see how fat she is.</i>

649
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:15,800
<i>You didn't see her tummy.</i>

650
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:17,440
<i>It's really scary.</i>

651
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:18,880
<i>It's like a swamp.</i>

652
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,400
<i>It'll sink by touch.</i>

653
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:25,320
<i>Hers are not breasts,
those are hot water bags.</i>

654
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:28,640
<i>Her eight-month pregnant body
is disgusting.</i>

655
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:31,000
<i>It's just like a bloated toad.</i>

656
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:00,400
