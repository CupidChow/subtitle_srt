1
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,680
ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE

2
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,920
<i>Professor He, have you eaten?</i>

3
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,000
Yes.

4
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,360
My mom made beef noodles.
I added two fried eggs.

5
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,840
<i>I see.</i>

6
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,640
<i>My uncle told me everything.</i>

7
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,200
<i>How is Mr. He now?</i>

8
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,600
<i>Shall I take leave and visit him?</i>

9
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,120
It's fine. Maybe next time.

10
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:15,920
<i>Okay.</i>

11
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,120
<i>Tomorrow is our store's anniversary.</i>

12
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,240
<i>I can take leave,
but my supervisor will scold me.</i>

13
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,840
<i>Right. We have a dance
for the store's anniversary.</i>

14
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,160
<i>Let me show you!</i>

15
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,160
I said stop. Can't you hear me?

16
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,880
Stop dancing!

17
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,520
Cai Minmin.

18
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,480
<i>Even my son can do these moves.</i>

19
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,240
<i>What are you practicing for? Come with me.</i>

20
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,560
<i>Seriously.</i>

21
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,600
<i>I can dance without the head.</i>

22
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,560
<i>Didn't you hear me?</i>

23
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,600
<i>Come with me! Hurry!</i>

24
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,560
<i>My phone!</i>

25
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,280
<i>Professor He, I have more surprises!</i>

26
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,520
<i>-I'm not done yet!
-Come with me!</i>

27
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,160
Sir, your delivery.

28
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:35,680
PLEASE DRAW A HAPPY MELON FOR MY BOYFRIEND

29
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,000
<i>Is he diagnosed with Alzheimer's?</i>

30
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,160
Yes.

31
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,280
<i>I'll do this.</i>

32
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:52,040
<i>I'll search for good local specialists.</i>

33
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,240
<i>Or how about this?</i>

34
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:57,360
<i>I'll take time off to visit Fanxing's dad.</i>

35
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:00,080
<i>It's fine if we didn't know he was sick.</i>

36
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,320
<i>But now that we do,
we should definitely pay him a visit.</i>

37
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,640
What?

38
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,280
Wouldn't you be meeting her parents?

39
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,960
It's like a forced marriage.

40
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:11,880
<i>What do you know?</i>

41
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,480
<i>Fanxing's dad has Alzheimer's.</i>

42
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,880
<i>If we don't visit him and meet him now,</i>

43
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,640
<i>do we wait until
he can't tell people apart?</i>

44
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,280
That's true.

45
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,200
I'll talk to Fanxing.

46
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,720
<i>Of course. We can't just show up.</i>

47
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,520
<i>By the way, how is Minmin's part-time job?</i>

48
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,400
I didn't think
that she would actually work.

49
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,600
<i>This daughter of mine,</i>

50
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,240
<i>I'd still worry that she'll starve
even if I hang food on her.</i>

51
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,320
Caiwei, don't worry.

52
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,000
Everyone knows how to grow up.

53
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,840
HE FANXING

54
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,360
Ms. He looks pretty as well today.

55
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,400
Don't you have work?

56
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,360
There's no hope for you, kid.

57
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,600
Forget it.

58
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,200
I didn't do anything.

59
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,160
Can't I be in a one-sided love?

60
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:40,280
An open one-sided love
is also moral coercion.

61
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,480
-Yuan Song, here!
-Hey.

62
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,800
What?

63
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,080
Nothing.

64
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,000
Come on.

65
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,160
Sit here.

66
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,320
Qingqing has left.

67
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,800
The seat next to mine is yours now.

68
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:12,880
-Should I kneel to thank you?
-No. People might think you're proposing.

69
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:16,080
I'm taken.

70
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,800
Are you still dating that taxi driver?

71
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,040
What taxi driver?

72
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:23,240
He's an elegant and chic chauffeur, okay?

73
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,960
They have uniforms.

74
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,520
He looks really sexy in it.

75
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,960
Since you're all here,

76
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,600
I'll tell you now.

77
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,040
Initially,

78
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,680
I planned to resign
before we move offices.

79
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,240
But my dad is sick.

80
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:40,280
I spoke to Mr. Li today.

81
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:43,120
Next Monday will be my last day.

82
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:47,120
I'm almost done with the handover.

83
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:50,040
So Bai can handle it alone now.

84
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,680
Mr. He is sick? What's wrong?

85
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:56,880
Alzheimer's.

86
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,000
Early stage.

87
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:03,440
We'll look for experts in this area
and see how things go.

88
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:06,880
So I have to spend more time
with my dad now.

89
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,400
Are you leaving already?

90
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,920
Qingqing just left.

91
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,600
Every department has someone leaving.

92
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,640
Now that you're leaving,

93
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,480
it feels like our big family

94
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,040
is breaking apart.

95
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,880
That's right. We're breaking apart.

96
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,320
But Ms. He's dad is sick.

97
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,440
She won't be in the mood to work.

98
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,040
Get through this first.

99
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,640
We're still in the same city.

100
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,680
Let's meet up when we're free.

101
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,720
That's right.

102
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,560
You're Ms. He's favorite. Say something.

103
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:41,840
I...

104
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,080
I can't be of much help.

105
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,240
Don't be too sad.

106
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,160
Why are you so nervous? You're stuttering.

107
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,600
My goodness. Seriously, Bai.

108
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,640
What face is that? What did I do?

109
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,800
Nothing, you fearless warrior.

110
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,600
Two days ago,

111
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,520
you searched for my dad with us
the whole night.

112
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,840
I saw your attendance.
You still came to work yesterday.

113
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,400
Thank you.

114
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,000
Someday, I will...

115
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,720
I will let Canyang treat you to a meal.

116
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,880
If you want to thank me,

117
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,720
buy me a meal yourself.

118
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,640
I know very well

119
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,600
that my unrequited love is moral coercion.

120
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:55,040
You're feeling very down
and have problems at home.

121
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,760
Yet I can't do anything to help.

122
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,200
The only thing I can do now
is not causing trouble.

123
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,840
But I don't want our final memory
to be a fight again.

124
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,840
Think about it.

125
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,080
Sure.

126
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I'll buy you a meal.

127
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,760
I also don't want to remember us

128
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,560
fighting until the end.

129
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,080
How about this weekend?

130
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:34,000
Let's play badminton
and have a meal after.

131
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,560
Okay. See you then.

132
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,440
-All right.
-I'll get back to work.

133
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,000
Dad.

134
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,880
-Mr. He.
-Yes, Song Xue.

135
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,840
My friend knows an expert
from the military hospital.

136
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,200
But he's booked until next Wednesday.

137
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,120
By then, I'll go with you.

138
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,000
Thank you, Song Xue.

139
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,360
Actually,

140
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:17,600
this disease isn't easy to cure.

141
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:22,040
But compared to our previous guess

142
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,040
of a nerve-compressing brain tumor,
this is better.

143
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:29,200
I don't have issues with it.

144
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:30,840
I'm just worried

145
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,920
that I will trouble all of you.

146
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,280
-Dad.
-What?

147
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,800
When your mom and I were your age,

148
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,640
we had two clueless kids

149
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,880
and elders to care for.

150
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,800
We also had to work.

151
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,320
We were working like clockwork every day.

152
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,560
We had to feed a big family.

153
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:57,200
Every penny earned was carefully spent.

154
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,040
It's different now.

155
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:03,200
You're in your 30s,
but you still behave like kids.

156
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:07,640
Now that I'm sick,
what are you going to do?

157
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:08,720
What else?

158
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:09,880
My salary isn't low.

159
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,000
I can support you.

160
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:15,400
That brain of yours
can only think of money.

161
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,760
-Eat up.
-Thank you, Mrs. He.

162
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,080
Eat some fruits for your brain.

163
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,720
Money is important,

164
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:26,000
but a patient needs to be cared for.

165
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,000
You're a bachelor.

166
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,000
You can't even look after yourself.
Who can you care for?

167
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,400
Is He Canyang your only child?

168
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,560
What about me?

169
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,400
I have resigned earlier anyway.

170
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,720
While I'm home, I'll take care of Dad.

171
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,200
Don't.

172
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,160
Your dad is not at that stage yet.

173
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,760
There is still me at home.

174
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:51,760
I just won't let your dad go out alone.

175
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,520
I'll follow him wherever he goes.

176
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,880
Just do what you have to do.

177
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,280
Everything will go on as usual.

178
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,680
Your mom is right.

179
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:03,120
Now that you're sick, you agree with me?

180
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,760
If I had I known,

181
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,560
I would have wished
you'd gotten Alzheimer's ten years ago.

182
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,320
When have I not agreed with you?

183
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,720
You're so forgetful.

184
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:16,280
Chances are high
that you'll get Alzheimer's too.

185
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:18,600
You're the one with Alzheimer's now!

186
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,480
-Seriously.
-Mom.

187
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,600
Stop saying the word "Alzheimer's".

188
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,440
It's horrible. I'd get Alzheimer's too.

189
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,680
You said it, not me.

190
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,400
Look. You got scolded.

191
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:34,920
In our family,

192
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,480
no one can defeat your mom.

193
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,800
Song Xue, you go.

194
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I'm just worried about the kids.

195
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,600
Especially Fanxing.

196
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,920
Look.

197
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,440
It's because you treat them like kids.

198
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,880
You support everything they do
and think for them.

199
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,120
That's why they don't grow up.

200
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,480
Before you talk about others,

201
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,600
you should think about your own problem.

202
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,320
Don't you pamper them?

203
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,000
You don't even let them
wash their own socks!

204
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,440
The only thing Fanxing can make
is fried eggs!

205
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:20,400
They just seem so busy with work.

206
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,480
I always do it, so it has become a habit.

207
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:27,160
Next time, I will try not to do so much.

208
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,640
I'll let go, all right?

209
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,720
If this disease continues to develop,

210
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,120
I won't be able
to tell people apart, right?

211
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,120
Listen to me.

212
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:42,200
One day, Fanxing will get married.

213
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,280
Other dads walk their daughters
down the aisle.

214
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:47,960
But I...

215
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:51,000
I probably won't be able
to recognize my own daughter.

216
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:57,600
If she gets bullied after she's married
and tells me about it,

217
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,680
I won't understand anything she says.

218
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:02,000
Even if I want to help,
I won't be able to.

219
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,360
This is so...

220
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:04,920
Qingfeng.

221
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,160
Don't think too much.

222
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:11,200
Didn't we contact the hospital
to get you treated?

223
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,800
Besides, Fanxing has a boyfriend now.

224
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,400
At this rate,

225
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:19,800
she might get married in a year or so.

226
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,440
You're right.

227
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,800
I beg you. Please don't rush her.

228
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:31,880
I won't rush her.

229
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,280
I'm just helping her.

230
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:39,680
Don't you also think
that Luming is pretty good?

231
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:43,880
That's true.

232
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,840
Hurry up and sleep.

233
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,320
You think too much.

234
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,160
That's why your brain degenerated.

235
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,360
Let's sleep.

236
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:55,960
Hurry up and sleep.

237
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,360
Let's sleep.

238
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,600
What took you so long?

239
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,560
You're still watching anime?

240
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:37,600
I can't watch it anymore.

241
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:45,920
Did you cry?

242
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:48,680
No.

243
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,320
No?

244
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,400
You can't hide it from me.

245
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,120
Song Xue.

246
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,240
I wish to get married.

247
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:07,760
You want to get married
because your dad is sick?

248
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,760
I don't want to, I wish to.

249
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,240
That means I already have such a plan,

250
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,520
but it just hasn't been fulfilled.

251
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,560
Ye Luming is indeed a good man to marry.

252
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,160
We get along well.

253
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,080
My family likes him too.

254
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,720
It sounds like
you're trying to convince yourself.

255
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,800
Don't be silly.

256
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:38,160
Don't force yourself to do things
that you don't want to do.

257
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,520
I'm not!

258
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,600
I'm just speeding up

259
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:46,160
the dating process with Ye
while working towards marriage.

260
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:49,400
I will like him a lot
that I want to marry him!

261
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:53,160
Have both of you kissed?

262
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,520
Yes. Over here.

263
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:02,400
Anyway, I've resigned.

264
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,840
I have a lot of time to spend.

265
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,560
The first mission
is to see doctors with my dad.

266
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:11,440
The second is to develop
my relationship with Ye.

267
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,680
The third

268
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,480
is to prepare to open a store!

269
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,840
You're the most enthusiastic person
in the world now.

270
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,600
<i>Friend, oh, friend</i>

271
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,560
<i>Drink up this glass of wine</i>

272
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,240
Get lost. I won't go crazy with you.

273
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:27,800
Come on.

274
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,000
Now that I think of it,

275
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,520
all the things we despised

276
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:50,320
and thought that we would never do,

277
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:53,240
we have all done it now.

278
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:58,760
Xiaoyu hates women
who know of their husband's affair,

279
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:01,080
yet refuse to divorce because of the kids.

280
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:02,520
As for you,

281
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:05,280
you only wanted to date out of love

282
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,880
and not just anyone compatible
just to get married.

283
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,280
As for me...

284
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:13,680
I know.

285
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:17,200
You're the only one who stayed the same.

286
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:20,800
I'm pregnant.

287
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,400
Pregnant?

288
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:30,200
I know you two don't want kids.

289
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,600
You're pregnant?

290
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:38,840
Apparently, condoms
have a two percent failure rate.

291
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:43,120
If I didn't get pregnant,
I wouldn't believe it.

292
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,400
You didn't drink?

293
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,000
I'm pregnant, so...

294
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,720
When I feel like drinking,

295
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,640
I'd just smell it.

296
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,000
Didn't Xiaoyu do the same?

297
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:09,360
-How long has it been?
-Almost three months.

298
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:15,840
So this was why you threw up
at Xiaoyu's house?

299
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:16,880
No.

300
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,160
That time, I really puked out of anger.

301
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,520
He has been good.

302
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,720
I haven't been feeling much
of the pregnancy symptoms.

303
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:31,160
I can't help but feel

304
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,680
that this accident

305
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,200
is the destiny that God has for me.

306
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:37,560
So,

307
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,720
you plan to let destiny run its course?

308
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:45,800
That day, I held Malty
and he looked right into me.

309
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:50,080
Suddenly, it felt like letting destiny run
its course isn't such a bad idea,

310
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:53,960
although the world doesn't seem good now.

311
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,760
But since he wants to come to this world,

312
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:04,560
I'll let him.

313
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,360
Since you let destiny run its course,

314
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:11,520
his nickname should be Tiantian.

315
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:13,480
Not bad.

316
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,840
No. What is this?

317
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:20,560
Does Dongyang know?

318
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,120
I broke up with him yesterday.

319
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:30,960
You know Dongyang dislikes kids.

320
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,880
I broke our promise.

321
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:38,080
I can't ruin his life either.

322
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,000
I will change.

323
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,640
No more business trips. I'll be with you.

324
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,280
No more socks in between the sofas.

325
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,440
No armpit shaver for my mustache.

326
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,200
Shake out the laundry before drying.

327
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:11,240
-I--
-Dongyang.

328
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:15,640
The sensor light at home has been broken
for almost a month.

329
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,520
Please fix it.

330
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:36,000
<i>If life was an exam,</i>

331
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:40,080
<i>we might be the worst students.</i>

332
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,760
<i>Everyone is seated
in the classroom for the exam of life.</i>

333
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,920
<i>Time is the strictest exam invigilator,</i>

334
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,920
<i>though it just stands outside the door</i>

335
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:55,960
<i>and doesn't make a sound.</i>

336
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:01,520
<i>Students are chased by time.</i>

337
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,440
<i>They answer in a rush.</i>

338
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:07,240
<i>Some would copy someone else's answers.</i>

339
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:10,520
<i>Some would toss coins.</i>

340
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:14,000
<i>Some would submit a blank paper.</i>

341
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,280
<i>Some would think so hard,</i>

342
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:21,840
<i>but still end up choosing
the worst answer.</i>

343
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,200
<i>There are also some</i>

344
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,080
<i>who would give their pen to someone else.</i>

345
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:37,000
<i>There are</i>

346
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,120
<i>no right or wrong answers.</i>

347
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:43,920
<i>There are only multiple-choice questions
in our life.</i>

348
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,840
<i>And it's you</i>

349
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:50,240
<i>who marks the paper
and finishes your lifelong journey.</i>

350
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:52,960
<i>By then,</i>

351
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:57,560
<i>how many points would we grade our lives?</i>

352
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,520
Let's eat if the food is ready.

353
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:02,600
Okay.

354
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,440
Are you in a bad mood today?

355
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,800
Why did you want to cook here?

356
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,240
I'm not.

357
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,520
Aren't you

358
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,640
on a break today?

359
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:25,840
After I go to the office
to pack my belongings today,

360
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
it will be officially over.

361
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:32,120
I've worked so hard for ten years.

362
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:36,440
Today is my first time
doing grocery shopping during office hours

363
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,360
and eat at my boyfriend's house.

364
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,640
It feels quite complicated.

365
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,080
Complicated?

366
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:50,800
So are you happy or sad?

367
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,200
It's not that.

368
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,840
It's like trying so hard

369
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,760
to think of an answer in an exam.

370
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:04,440
But when I turned around,

371
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:07,080
the tree outside bloomed.

372
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,680
So I stopped to look at the flowers.

373
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,000
Using exams as a life metaphor.

374
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,880
It's quite like you.

375
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,600
What about you?

376
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,720
Life is like a casino.

377
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:26,240
If you have chips, you have hope.

378
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:31,640
That is really quite like you.

379
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:33,960
Right.

380
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,080
Here's the thing.

381
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,680
My sister wants to visit Mr. He.

382
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,720
She just thinks that

383
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,720
we should visit him since we're dating.

384
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,040
Nothing else.

385
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:49,480
If you find it inconvenient,
then forget about it.

386
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,080
Of course, you can.

387
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:53,840
Sure.

388
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,160
Why?

389
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,920
You know my family so well.

390
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,560
I would like to know yours too.

391
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,040
Is that wrong?

392
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:14,080
It smells so good. I'm so hungry.

393
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,520
What did I say?

394
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,400
They'll wake up when the food is ready.

395
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:22,600
Fanxing, you're here.

396
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,680
You're awake.

397
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,200
Minmin, your friend is here too.

398
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,680
Right, let me introduce you.

399
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,400
My best friend, Liu Zhanni.

400
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:34,840
This is He Fanxing,
my uncle's beautiful girlfriend.

401
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,360
Just call her Fanxing.

402
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,120
-Hello, Fanxing.
-Hello.

403
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,520
You two, wash up and eat.

404
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:42,920
Okay!

405
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,920
Yesterday was the store's anniversary.

406
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,320
Zhanni and I worked until 2:00 a.m.

407
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:55,200
Our supervisor was so stingy
that he didn't give us any tips,

408
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,600
just one meal.

409
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,960
How many staff are there?

410
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:01,920
It'd cost a lot.

411
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:04,040
If one meal will do,

412
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:05,440
why give tips?

413
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:07,200
Profiteer.

414
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:09,400
Fanxing.

415
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,960
Don't you think that
my uncle's mindset is problematic?

416
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:17,000
From an employer's perspective,

417
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:19,480
your uncle is right.

418
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,800
Did you hear that?

419
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,200
Fine, just side with him.

420
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,040
Here.

421
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,200
Do I look like a squirrel?

422
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,880
Yes, you're a squirrel.

423
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,440
Here, one more.

424
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:51,720
Right, remember to like my new post.

425
00:28:58,800 --> 00:28:59,800
I'm screwed!

426
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,360
A 20-year major bad luck!

427
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:04,280
I'm Taurus and my uncle is Libra.
We're the main victims!

428
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:06,040
We're both dead!

429
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:10,240
The last one was 10 years.
And now it's 20 years?

430
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,080
Why are you staring at my uncle's photo?

431
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,200
Don't tell me you like him.

432
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:24,320
Please! Don't worry,
your uncle is my uncle.

433
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:27,360
I'm looking at your uncle's girlfriend.

434
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:30,560
Why does she look so familiar?

435
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,400
Like I've seen her before.

436
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:33,960
That's normal.

437
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:36,200
All good-looking people look similar.

438
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,320
No.

439
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,400
I've definitely seen her before.

440
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,640
I know her voice too.

441
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,040
It's just like...

442
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:50,760
What kind of monster are you
to be able to remember a person

443
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,360
after one meeting?

444
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,600
I can't remember faces well.

445
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:00,800
Melon!

446
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,000
Look!

447
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,280
Don't they look alike?

448
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:04,680
Like what?

449
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,680
Big eyes?

450
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,960
A few months ago, at Yuan Song's house,

451
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,800
we thought she was the cleaner!

452
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,600
-Don't they look alike?
-No way!

453
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:15,880
What are you saying?

454
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,520
They don't know each other!

455
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,680
You could have just called
for advice on decoration.

456
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:43,720
You just want free coffee, right?

457
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:47,840
What's up?

458
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,360
You're not going to confess, are you?

459
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:52,920
Yuan Song.

460
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,240
Is He Fanxing your ex-girlfriend?

461
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:00,040
Your uncle told you?

462
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:04,040
I knew it.

463
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:09,680
On the way here, I thought
Zhanni and I made a mistake

464
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:14,520
and the girl we mistook for the cleaner
just happened to look like my aunt.

465
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:16,960
How can this be?

466
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:21,960
Our friends and colleagues
only found out after we broke up.

467
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:24,640
Are you unhappy?

468
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:28,800
Shouldn't that be you instead?

469
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:32,320
I said so many dumb things
in front of you.

470
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:35,720
I even boasted about
how my uncle got the girl he liked.

471
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,760
I'm so embarrassed now.

472
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,400
Don't worry.

473
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:42,560
You and your uncle are different.

474
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:43,800
I'm not mad at you.

475
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,720
The more you do this,
the more guilty I feel.

476
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:49,400
I'm so sorry, Yuan Song.

477
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:52,280
Can I repay my uncle's debts in return?

478
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:54,840
I'll break up with my boyfriend
and you can take me. All right?

479
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:57,720
Of course not.

480
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,680
You don't like me.

481
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,040
Forget it.

482
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:03,560
Then let me buy you a meal.

483
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,560
I'll be your on-call lackey.

484
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:07,720
If you like anyone in the future,
I'll help you out.

485
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:11,560
How's that? Do you accept my apology?

486
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:14,560
If I don't accept it,
are you going to keep talking?

487
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:20,160
I'll apologize until the cafÃ© closes
and then continue at a bar.

488
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,360
Smiling means that you accept it.

489
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:27,160
If you had always been this shameless,

490
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:29,000
you could have taken down ten of me.

491
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,520
All men are liars.

492
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,240
You say nice things,

493
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:37,800
but you choose empathetic and sensible
girls like Fanxing in the end.

494
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:39,680
She's sensible?

495
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,320
She aged for nothing.

496
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,000
She's just like a little girl.

497
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:46,360
When something happens at home,
she would just panic.

498
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,520
Beauty lies in the eye of the beholder.

499
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:53,600
Do you still like her?

500
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,320
Does it matter?

501
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:01,840
Your uncle suits her better than I do.

502
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:06,240
Why are you full of adults' bad habits?

503
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:09,160
Love is not about being compatible.

504
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,560
It's love!

505
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,640
Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai.

506
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,040
Romeo and Juliet.

507
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:18,000
Lovely and tragic love stories

508
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,280
are the result
of challenging feudal ethics.

509
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:23,680
I guess you paid attention
in Professor He's class.

510
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,080
Of course.

511
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:29,560
So do you want me to get her back for you?

512
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:35,640
I...

513
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,800
My uncle is almost 40.

514
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,680
My mom yearns for a nephew so much
that she's going crazy.

515
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:45,200
Those who challenged feudal ethics
have all died.

516
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,080
You're right.

517
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,880
Normal people should just find
someone suitable.

518
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:55,240
"Full of adults' bad habits", right?

519
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:38,560
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR'S OFFICE

520
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:40,720
Ms. He.

521
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,000
Keep in touch.

522
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:45,200
Of course.

523
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:48,240
We don't work together anymore,
but we're still friends.

524
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,880
I am no longer your director.

525
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:52,320
Just call me by my name.

526
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,280
He Fanxing.

527
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,200
Fanxing!

528
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:01,920
I suddenly feel like a free slave.
Why is that?

529
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:05,440
Fanxing, be sure to visit us.

530
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,840
Don't worry. We won't be strangers.

531
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,560
She's going to be a florist,

532
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:11,360
so she needs us as her customers.

533
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:12,880
That's right.

534
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:14,760
I'll treat you to a meal next time.

535
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:16,400
Look.

536
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:19,360
Even if she has resigned,
Ms. He is still Ms. He.

537
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:20,840
She still buys us meals.

538
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,520
Be sure to call Qingqing.

539
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,960
She's so free now.

540
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,840
She keeps bragging
about having fun on social media.

541
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,680
That's relaxation.

542
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:34,280
Everyone has agreed
to visit your dad someday.

543
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:35,920
Sure.

544
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,880
Okay, get back to work. Stop chatting.

545
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:42,080
Bai, take note of those
who are late and lazy.

546
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,040
Don't let them off.

547
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:44,920
I got it. Seriously.

548
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,520
You're leaving,
but you're still like this.

549
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:47,680
All right.

550
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:49,840
-Then I--
-I'll see you off.

551
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,760
-I'll get going. Bye!
-Bye!

552
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,600
Be sure to visit us!

553
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:04,760
This must be the end.

554
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:06,880
The curtain closes.

555
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:08,640
That's right.

556
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:09,880
A sad ending.

557
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,920
Please. What ending is this?

558
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,400
We want a happy ending.

559
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:17,240
It will be a happy ending!

560
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,640
Get to work or I'll deduct your pay!

561
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:20,680
Go!

562
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:24,640
While the cat is away, the mice will play.

563
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:27,040
She'll be the cat from now on.

564
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:28,280
A bad cat.

565
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,440
You!

566
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:51,640
What's this?

567
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:55,520
My classmate's grandpa
also has Alzheimer's.

568
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:58,040
I asked him for some tips in daily life.

569
00:36:58,360 --> 00:36:59,400
He wrote this.

570
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:02,240
I've sent you the digital copy.
You can print it out.

571
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:09,040
How nice of you.

572
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,000
Thank you.

573
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:14,880
If you have time,
do you want to visit my dad?

574
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:19,720
I'll pass.

575
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,040
I'll see you at the badminton court
this weekend.

576
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:24,560
Okay.

577
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:58,200
Shouldn't you be with your dad?

578
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:00,480
I can't just stay with him every day.

579
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,240
You miss me, right?

580
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,520
I can't stand it. It's so hot.

581
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:09,560
I'll ask for leave and buy you milk tea!

582
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:13,560
I'm serious.

583
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,520
Your family is having issues now.

584
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:17,560
We can go on lesser dates.

585
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,240
Don't miss me too much.

586
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,360
You wear this every day at work.

587
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:23,800
I feel hot for you.

588
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,680
Why not change to another job?
Being a waitress is easier.

589
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:29,440
This one pays well and I get paid daily.

590
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:32,200
My mom's birthday is coming soon.

591
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,680
I want to buy her a scarf
with the money I make.

592
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:39,440
Why? Do you feel sorry for me?

593
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,240
Silence means agreement.

594
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:48,800
It's so hard to deal
with old people like you.

595
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:51,360
You won't say it
when you miss me or feel sorry for me.

596
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:55,000
I heard you used to be
very good at dating.

597
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:59,320
Maybe my intelligence dropped
after I met you.

598
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,680
People who are in love
tend to have lower intelligence.

599
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:08,080
If so, does that mean you like me a lot?

600
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:11,720
Perhaps.

601
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:17,280
Right,

602
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:20,640
I met Yuan Song today.

603
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:23,600
-Is the renovation done?
-Not yet.

604
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,360
Almost.

605
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:29,360
Do you know

606
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:32,200
who Yuan Song's ex-girlfriend was?

607
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:34,920
I don't know.

608
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:38,360
I didn't even know he broke up.
That rascal!

609
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,560
Did he tell you?

610
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:42,680
I don't know.

611
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:44,160
He refused to tell me.

612
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:45,720
How mysterious.

613
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:48,720
I wonder what kind of beauty she is.

614
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,040
That's right.

615
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:58,240
By the way, next semester,
I'll transfer to the art institute.

616
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:59,240
What?

617
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:00,960
Why?

618
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:02,080
Because of you.

619
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,080
Are you dumping me?

620
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:06,720
Why would you think so?

621
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:08,840
You have to study for another two years.

622
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,920
If people find out, they will gossip.

623
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:13,240
I'd better leave.

624
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:15,800
I'm not afraid of gossip.

625
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:18,880
They used to think
that my uncle was my sugar daddy.

626
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:22,160
Though they're not exactly wrong.

627
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,520
I know, but I want to protect you.

628
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:31,080
I didn't know
that you would think that far.

629
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:37,920
Not exactly.
The art institute offers higher pay.

630
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:46,240
By the way,
my mom will visit Mr. He tomorrow.

631
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:47,200
You know it, right?

632
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:49,560
No. Nobody told me.

633
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:53,000
Visiting him is one thing,

634
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:56,040
but it's also to meet your parents.

635
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:57,280
I see.

636
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:59,960
I got it. I won't go back.

637
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:02,960
It's fine. My mom doesn't know you anyway.

638
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:05,240
If you see her, leave a good impression.

639
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:21,200
For your meals,

640
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,240
eat more beans and fish

641
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:27,160
to increase your intake
of soft phospholipids

642
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:28,720
and unsaturated fatty acids.

643
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:31,280
You should also exercise!

644
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:33,880
Exercise. Line dancing would be ideal!

645
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:36,760
"Line dancing can help prevent dementia."

646
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:38,640
This is good! Hey.

647
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:43,440
Qingfeng, are you listening?

648
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:45,080
I'm reading it to you.

649
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:49,680
I've always carried my keys with me
since I was young.

650
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:50,760
I'm used to it.

651
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:52,280
I disagreed

652
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:55,880
when Canyang wanted to install
the keyless door lock.

653
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:59,280
The things left behind by our ancestors

654
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:02,880
are slowly disappearing
and becoming outdated.

655
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:06,880
That's right.

656
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:07,600
