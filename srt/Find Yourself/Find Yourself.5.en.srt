1
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,680
-Thank you.
-Stop it. You're so annoying.

2
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,680
Bye, Professor Song.

3
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,920
Professor He.

4
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,720
Did you hear everything?

5
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,120
Come.

6
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:30,560
Come here.

7
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,360
Don't!

8
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,360
What is it?

9
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,960
It's nothing.

10
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,480
Hey, why is your nose bleeding?

11
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,040
Cai Minmin, come back here!

12
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,120
Did you pull a prank on me?

13
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,240
Fanxing.

14
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,600
When did you start to like
shopping for clothes?

15
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,960
I guess after I graduated
and started working.

16
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:25,320
After I started making money,
my desire grew for various things.

17
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,560
You are just like the others.

18
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:30,160
Your desire to buy things is at par
with the amount of money you have.

19
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,800
Your life won't be so bad
no matter how you live it.

20
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,360
I am not as lucky.

21
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,560
Since I was young, I couldn't resist it
whenever I saw pretty clothes.

22
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:41,720
During high school, I saved money
for clothes until I got gastritis.

23
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,600
I could endure gastritis,

24
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:46,360
but how could I stand
not buying clothes I like?

25
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,520
If we can't get the person we like,
we have to bear with it.

26
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,600
But with money,
we can get the things we want.

27
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:57,240
If we can't even do that,
life would be too bitter.

28
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,440
That's right.

29
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,040
To live a good life,
I can never endure these two things.

30
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:05,600
I should find a rich man
who I would like as well.

31
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,120
A rich man who you would like?

32
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,840
So his wealth is the priority?

33
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,280
Of course.

34
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,120
All troubles loom on poor married couples.

35
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,960
They work so hard to make a living
and always pull a long face.

36
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,000
They will look like they're 50
when they are 40,

37
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,720
and look like 80 when they hit 50.

38
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,920
When a man is courting you, he would say,

39
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,120
"I love your young, pretty face.

40
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,000
I would also like to kiss your wrinkles
when you are 80."

41
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,080
Great.

42
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,520
He doesn't have to wait until I am 80.

43
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,240
He can do it when I am only 50.

44
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,040
Come, kiss me.

45
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:37,960
This means

46
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:41,560
that your florist guy is not only rich,

47
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,000
but you like him as well.

48
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,280
This is not enough, something is missing.

49
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,720
I'll just get a set of La Mer
and it would be perfect.

50
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,720
That would be 1,280 yuan.

51
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,120
Are you paying in cash or card?

52
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,240
-Card.
-All right.

53
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,520
This one.

54
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,640
Okay.

55
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,680
Why don't you use the florist guy's card?

56
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:06,960
Of course not.

57
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,280
Once I make a payment,

58
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,840
he will receive a message.

59
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,240
Then why did you accept it?

60
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,440
I will use it, but not now.

61
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,400
Thank you.

62
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,400
Let's get Japanese food, it is less oily.

63
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,040
Sure.

64
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,360
Hey.

65
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,880
-Why?
-Isn't that Yuan Song?

66
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,560
That girl must be his girlfriend.

67
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,600
They look good together.

68
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,720
-Hey, Yuan Song--
-Wait.

69
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,240
Don't call him.

70
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:44,000
Who would want to meet
their superior after work?

71
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,400
You are right.

72
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,200
He would prefer to hide from you.

73
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,400
Hey, let's go that way.

74
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,240
-Let's look around over there.
-Sure.

75
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,760
Let's share the ride.
It's hard to get a cab now.

76
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,320
We are going in opposite directions,
so there's no need. Bye.

77
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,320
See you tomorrow.

78
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,600
<i>Where are you?</i>

79
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,960
<i>Good morning, my Ms. He.</i>

80
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,880
<i>I am not late today, so praise me.</i>

81
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,360
<i>I'm going to the site. See you tonight.</i>

82
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,920
<i>I am held up by my classmates. </i>

83
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,560
<i>We can't walk the dog together
again tonight.</i>

84
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:35,680
Thank you.

85
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,920
Even if you read my WeChat messages
a thousand times,

86
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,200
I won't know what you're thinking
if you never reply.

87
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,560
Have your friends left?

88
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,160
Yes, they have all gone home.

89
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,640
Don't misunderstand,
they are my juniors at school.

90
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,560
What is there to misunderstand?

91
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,000
Great.

92
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:06,120
I have been thinking all night about what
I should do if you were to misunderstand.

93
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,200
You are already thinking
that I am too young,

94
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,080
then you saw me with other girls.

95
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,720
I am already viewed as an intern
with no sense of time

96
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,480
and now, I have turned into

97
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,000
a flirty playboy.

98
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:20,200
I guess I would only be able to win
your heart in the next life.

99
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,600
Yuan Song.

100
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,600
I have been thinking

101
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,920
if I have sent you the wrong message.

102
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,760
What do you mean?

103
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,120
You know about Li Haomiao.

104
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,440
You also know my situation.

105
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:38,040
Perhaps you are affected by the fact

106
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,000
that I am desperate to be in love,

107
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,880
so it led to the misconception
that you like me?

108
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,560
You were initially afraid of me.

109
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,720
Even Cong Xiao knows that.

110
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,000
Even if you aren't anymore,

111
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,920
you won't come to like me.

112
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:55,000
Everyone would be afraid
of their strict boss,

113
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,800
but that's not hatred.

114
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,480
If I had not known all those things

115
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,120
and how adorable you are,

116
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:05,640
maybe I wouldn't have been so sure
of my feelings.

117
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,680
But now,

118
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,760
I know it very well.

119
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,120
He Fanxing,

120
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:14,960
I like you.

121
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,080
How is that possible?

122
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:32,440
All you think about is
how to trick me or piss me off.

123
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:33,920
It's because you always ignore me.

124
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,000
But...

125
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,760
-But--
-Can I interpret this as,

126
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:40,400
"You like me, but we can't be together"?

127
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,000
But--

128
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:45,200
"You are right, but we can't be together."

129
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:49,160
Those words are hurtful,
yet you said them twice.

130
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,400
Why are you pressuring me so hard?

131
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,680
Isn't it normal for me to say no?

132
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:00,720
Regardless...

133
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:02,960
Regardless,

134
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,480
I have never said
that we would be together.

135
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,160
Besides, it has only been 24 hours
since you confessed your feelings to me.

136
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,440
Should I say yes after you have confessed?

137
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,200
Why? Just because you are handsome?

138
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,320
Do you think that I am handsome?

139
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,840
Just because you are handsome,

140
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,720
you skip work, you disrespect me

141
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,840
and you think you have me
in the palm of your hands.

142
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,560
Yes, I take care of you
because you're handsome.

143
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,160
So what? Is that illegal?

144
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,400
I am already 32 and I have never dated,

145
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:38,160
but I know that I am an independent
and confident woman.

146
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:41,680
Also, I am still looking forward to
being in love and having a beautiful life.

147
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,440
I am aware

148
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:46,520
that many think
I am just a crazy leftover woman.

149
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,040
So, even if I like you,

150
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,920
you are still my brother's student
and our company's intern,

151
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,800
and you are ten years younger than me!

152
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,800
You--

153
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,120
What's wrong?

154
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,240
Are you crying?

155
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,040
Wait, you...

156
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,200
He Fanxing.

157
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,680
You have let it slip.

158
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,120
What?

159
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:05,000
We met each other several times.

160
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,840
They were either a misunderstanding
or a coincidence.

161
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,280
Also, those meetings were
not pre-arranged.

162
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,440
What would you call that?

163
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,200
Destiny.

164
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,480
How will you court her then?

165
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:20,160
"Court" is an interesting word.

166
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,960
Have you seen two kids playing games?

167
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,760
One is running,
while the other one is chasing.

168
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:31,240
It is easy to make the person
in front of you come to you instead.

169
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,560
Just stop

170
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,640
and she will stop and look.

171
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,760
Then you just have to crouch down

172
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,240
and stick your hand out.

173
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,440
Then say,

174
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,560
"I can't get up, pull me up."

175
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,160
That is cheating.

176
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,600
It's called being vulnerable.

177
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:53,880
Besides,

178
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,040
she has a crucial weakness.

179
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:57,960
She has never dated.

180
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,360
Based on my many years
of dating experience,

181
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,360
right now, I am basically

182
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,120
an expert with a rare weapon.

183
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,240
She is a novice holding a cane.

184
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,120
I have victory at hand.

185
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:13,960
Many years of experience?

186
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,000
Don't be so full of yourself.

187
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:22,200
Did you know that there is
an unexpected situation in mahjong?

188
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,120
It is called "interception".

189
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,960
Perhaps she has never had any admirers
for the past 30 years,

190
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,640
but there could be few around her now

191
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:31,240
and you won't be the only one.

192
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,080
That's even better.

193
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,560
Having competition
means I have great taste.

194
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,680
I was worried
that she would be an easy win.

195
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,360
Good.

196
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,120
I shall wish you success.

197
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,560
Thank you, just wait until I introduce
my girlfriend to you.

198
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:47,840
I hope you won't ask me to drink with you
to vent over her.

199
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,600
Don't jinx it.

200
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:55,800
<i>He Fanxing.</i>

201
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,920
<i>You have let it slip.</i>

202
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,160
<i>You have let it slip.</i>

203
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,360
<i>You have let it slip.</i>

204
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:35,000
Why are you already awake?

205
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,240
Sleep a little longer.

206
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,920
Canyang is out to buy a Chinese cruller.

207
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,760
I'll wake you up once he is back.

208
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,600
Keep your voice down,
I can't hear the television.

209
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:43,760
But...

210
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,160
Dad, Mom.

211
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:56,520
If someone likes--

212
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,400
-Stop watching.
-Goodness.

213
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,280
-Enough.
-My neck hurts.

214
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,920
-I...
-I need a massage.

215
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,480
-The soy milk is boiling.
-I have to...

216
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:05,280
I have to get a massage.

217
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,240
My neck hurts.

218
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:14,720
Here they go again.

219
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,440
Don't you realize
that I am already 32 years old?

220
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,240
Good morning, Ms. He.

221
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,160
Morning.

222
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:47,880
Good morning, Ms. He.

223
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,440
<i>Thank you.</i>

224
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:52,720
-Qingqing.
-Yes?

225
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,680
Have Chang Huan, Cong Xiao and Yuan Song

226
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,600
all gone to set up the booth
at the sales office?

227
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:02,560
Both Chang Huan and Cong Xiao
have already gone there.

228
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:03,800
Yuan Song took a sick leave.

229
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:06,480
I see.

230
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,400
Yes.

231
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,720
My mom called me this morning to remind me

232
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,080
to make over-easy eggs next Tuesday.

233
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,160
I can't even remember
what I have to do tomorrow.

234
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,480
How am I supposed to remember that?

235
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,760
It's even my 30th birthday.

236
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,600
Why did she have to keep reminding me?

237
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,720
Why don't you eat birthday cakes
instead of over-easy eggs?

238
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,880
You're indeed the modern Marie Antoinette.

239
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:30,000
I lived in a small county town.

240
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,960
We didn't have cakes growing up.

241
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:34,200
We would eat two over-easy eggs
for birthdays instead.

242
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,480
No cake on your birthday?

243
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:38,840
That's news to me.

244
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:41,960
Then, did you celebrate it
with your classmates?

245
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,560
Missy,

246
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,120
of course not.

247
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,920
Even adults don't celebrate birthdays.
Only our elders at home do.

248
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,000
Is that so?

249
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,560
That is such a drag.

250
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:55,600
You are a millennial living the good life.

251
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:58,880
When I was three years old,
my grandma finally had electricity.

252
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,760
We were using oil lamps before that.

253
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,560
When I was young,
there was no computer or cellphone.

254
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:06,680
I would always play in the mud
by the river.

255
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:08,960
I can't imagine that.

256
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,080
It is like living in ancient times.

257
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,440
However,

258
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:17,480
I really wish to go back to the time
I was playing mud by the river.

259
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,480
I wouldn't have to turn 30

260
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,280
and worry about aging,

261
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:25,320
parents pushing me to marry,

262
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,000
parents dying of old age,

263
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,800
falling sick alone,

264
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,600
or growing up.

265
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,040
Ms. Bai.

266
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,040
I am fine.

267
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,840
The rain is just making me emotional.

268
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,040
Eat up.

269
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:44,880
By the way, Ms. He.

270
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:47,280
For this month's employee birthday party,

271
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,800
let's celebrate it
on this upcoming Monday?

272
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,640
If it's okay,
I'll make reservations for karaoke.

273
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:58,160
Four people will have their birthdays
this month and Yuan Song is the new one.

274
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,600
-Is his birthday this month?
-Yes.

275
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:02,680
When?

276
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,320
I think it is today.

277
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,680
He is even on sick leave.

278
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:09,480
Could he be using this excuse
to celebrate with his friends?

279
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:12,160
It would be good if he really did.

280
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,240
He lives alone
and his parents are not here.

281
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:17,960
He's sick and home alone on his birthday.

282
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:20,040
Doesn't that sound pitiful?

283
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:55,640
<i>Are you sick?</i>

284
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,040
<i>How are you feeling?</i>

285
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,840
<i>Are you home or at the hospital?</i>

286
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,240
MS. HE

287
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,440
Hey, Canyang.

288
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:32,760
Well...

289
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,800
Do you perhaps know
where Yuan Song is staying?

290
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,280
He is sick and didn't come in
for work today.

291
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,440
I want to visit him as I'm a bit worried.

292
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:45,320
All right, send it over.

293
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,040
<i>I used to imagine</i>

294
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,520
<i>how I will meet the person I like.</i>

295
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,760
<i>I would be wearing a beautiful dress</i>

296
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,680
<i>with a nice make up</i>

297
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,480
<i>and spray on some perfume.</i>

298
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:05,400
<i>I would be like a perfect blossom
under the shining sun</i>

299
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,000
<i>and kiss the butterfly.</i>

300
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,960
<i>I would run all the way there,</i>

301
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,400
<i>as light as the breeze,</i>

302
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,680
<i>without stopping.</i>

303
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:19,320
<i>I want to shower him with passionate love.</i>

304
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:57,960
Let me in first.

305
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,120
Qingqing said you took a sick leave.

306
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:11,960
So I came to see you.

307
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:19,800
You are burning up.

308
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,120
Have you eaten?

309
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:23,640
What about medicine?

310
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,640
You are sick,
so you shouldn't drink cold water.

311
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,720
Stay in bed.

312
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,760
I will boil water and cook for you.

313
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,720
Your hands are cold
and your clothes are wet.

314
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:57,680
I am fine.

315
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,440
I was just caught in the rain for a bit.

316
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,880
Go take a hot shower.

317
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,240
You are here to see me,
so don't fall sick either.

318
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,200
Your hair is all wet.

319
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,080
Okay.

320
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:30,600
You're awake.

321
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,000
How are you feeling?

322
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:35,720
Great.

323
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,280
What time is it?

324
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:42,840
It's past 11 now.

325
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:44,800
I'm sorry.

326
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
I have caused you trouble.

327
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,440
When you are sick, don't say,

328
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,680
"I'm sorry, I have caused you trouble."

329
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,640
You should say,
"Thank you, I appreciate it."

330
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,760
Thank you, I appreciate it.

331
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,760
It is nothing compared to being sick.

332
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:12,000
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

333
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,400
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

334
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:19,480
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

335
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:23,440
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

336
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:29,960
It is such a pity to be spending
your birthday at home, being sick.

337
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:31,720
Don't be too moved.

338
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,320
I felt sorry for you,
so I got you a birthday cake.

339
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,320
Happy birthday.

340
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:39,760
This morning, I was thinking,

341
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:43,160
am I sick today because Buddha hates me?

342
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:46,320
But it seems that
Buddha loves me after all.

343
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,360
Buddha is very busy.

344
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,160
He doesn't have time to love or hate you.

345
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,120
Make a wish.

346
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:08,520
I wish that He Fanxing
will be my girlfriend.

347
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:19,160
Just keep it to yourself,
why did you say it out loud?

348
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:21,040
Why didn't you say no?

349
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:26,960
Stop messing around.

350
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,240
Let's eat the cake.

351
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:37,240
You look pretty this way.

352
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:51,440
Don't waste food.

353
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:52,680
What?

354
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,480
It's so sweet.

355
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:14,920
I don't think this seems right.

356
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,440
You like me

357
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,320
and I like you too.

358
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,400
What's so bad about it?

359
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,040
It is bad, it is wrong

360
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,360
and we shouldn't do this.

361
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,040
<i>It is bad,</i>

362
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:46,240
<i>it is wrong and we shouldn't do this.</i>

363
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,920
<i>But I still like it.</i>

364
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,280
Did you just come home?

365
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:13,800
How is Yuan Song?

366
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,600
He had a fever and was all alone.

367
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:20,600
So I stayed at his house
just to take care of him.

368
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:23,880
Of course.

369
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:26,280
He's just a kid.
It's not like you will sleep with him.

370
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,680
-Morning, Dad, Mom.
-Morning.

371
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,080
Fanxing, did you just come home?

372
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:42,680
Yes.

373
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:43,880
Have you eaten?

374
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,760
Yesterday, I...

375
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,080
-Last night--
-Canyang told me already.

376
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,520
After all,

377
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,040
Yuan Song is still a boy.

378
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:02,000
He will feel awkward
if you take care of him.

379
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,880
Why would he feel awkward?

380
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,400
Of course, he would.

381
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:08,320
You are his superior
and his professor's sister.

382
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,560
You are older than him.

383
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:13,160
Mom, are you looking down on me?

384
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,400
I am only ten years older than him.

385
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,480
Do I look that old?

386
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:18,960
Do you like Yuan Song?

387
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,800
I think you are the one who does.

388
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,600
What nonsense are you spurting?

389
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:26,360
Do you think your sister
has no sense like you?

390
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,200
Great.

391
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,600
Then why are you so upset
being told you're older than him?

392
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:34,000
Even if you like him,
he would never like you.

393
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:37,160
Do you have any idea how popular
he is in school?

394
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:39,920
So many girls follow him to class

395
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,360
and take his photo through the window.

396
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,560
And it's so easy to get

397
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,560
into his Ballroom Dance Club.

398
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,800
He has too many girls to choose from.

399
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,120
He Canyang.

400
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:53,760
Do you think girls are like cabbages
in the market?

401
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,160
That you can just choose among them?

402
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:57,760
I didn't mean it that way,
but am I not allowed to be honest?

403
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,440
Why are you so fired up in the morning?

404
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:01,680
Is it early menopause?

405
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:03,360
Who has menopause?

406
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:05,400
I wasn't talking about you, Mom.

407
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:07,160
Going on and on about menopause!

408
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:08,720
You are so chatty early in the morning.

409
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,280
You provoked her
and said she has menopause.

410
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:12,760
You are just like your dad!

411
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:13,840
Hey.

412
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:17,040
Just scold him and keep me out of it.

413
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,240
Men are all the same.

414
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,280
Do you know that this isn't right?

415
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,760
You are taking it out on me instead.

416
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,600
Don't you have a car?

417
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:30,760
Why do you always make me your driver?

418
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:34,200
The parking fee is too expensive.

419
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:42,120
<i>Girls, after a one-night-stand
with a colleague,</i>

420
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,440
<i>how can I avoid being awkward
when we meet?</i>

421
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:45,600
<i>Urgent.</i>

422
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:47,960
<i>A colleague?</i>

423
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:49,640
<i>Little Gorilla, tell me.</i>

424
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:52,760
<i>Why would you ever have a one-night stand
with a colleague?</i>

425
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,120
<i>Father said,</i>

426
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,400
<i>"What is done cannot be undone.
Donâ€™t be so sad.</i>

427
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:58,280
<i>There is always a way out.</i>

428
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,760
<i>Just act natural."</i>

429
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,600
Then what is your car for?

430
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:10,240
To take my dog and best friends
to weekend barbecues.

431
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:15,680
Hadn't I always been your driver
every time you went for barbecues?

432
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:20,000
When my girlfriend tagged along,
she said Yang Xiaoyu and I were flirting.

433
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:22,440
Though I would say
we were more like fighting--

434
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:24,320
<i>How? Should I scold him?</i>

435
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:26,120
<i>You could beat him up as well.</i>

436
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,920
<i>It won't be awkward if you are enemies.</i>

437
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:30,680
<i>Or just tell him a dirty joke
to lighten the mood.</i>

438
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:32,480
<i>If one is not enough, tell two.</i>

439
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,640
<i>Dirty joke? Are you out of your mind?</i>

440
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,440
<i>You should do it again, of course.</i>

441
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,480
<i>The second time is always better.</i>

442
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,280
<i>Guys, stop joking around. </i>

443
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:42,960
<i>Just act like nothing ever happened.</i>

444
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:47,000
<i>Adults just have a tacit understanding
about this kind of thing.</i>

445
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:48,880
"A tacit understanding"?

446
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,240
So do we need to be telepathic?

447
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,200
Hey.

448
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:57,920
Are you even listening?

449
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,640
Yes, I am. Just go on.

450
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:12,240
<i>Act natural.</i>

451
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,480
<i>Just a tacit understanding.</i>

452
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,080
<i>Just act like I normally do.</i>

453
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:17,120
<i>Act like I normally do.</i>

454
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:21,400
<i>How do I normally act?</i>

455
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:22,520
I will be going out later.

456
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:25,360
The client is asking for
the Donghu unit design.

457
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:27,080
Send it to me once you are done.

458
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,240
-Sure, how many copies?
-<i>Act normal.</i>

459
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:30,960
-Two copies. Send me one.
<i>-Normal.</i>

460
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,320
-I will be at my desk.
-Okay.

461
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:37,920
Good morning, Ms. He.

462
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:04,360
What a coward.

463
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:08,360
My face was so stiff as if
I have been injected with hyaluronan.

464
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:11,000
It was just sex.

465
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:12,600
Why should I be afraid?

466
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,000
Ms. He!

467
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:27,000
I'm sorry.

468
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:28,880
I must have surprised you.

469
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:30,080
Hey.

470
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,600
Why did you close the door?

471
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:36,640
I was worried that others might see us.

472
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:38,640
Close it then.

473
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:45,920
But the place is small and we are alone.

474
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:47,880
A closed-door seems worse.

475
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:51,880
Then open the door.

476
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:59,760
But if they hear what I'm about to say,
that might be worse.

477
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:01,960
Close it then.

478
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,080
Should I open or close it?

479
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:04,320
Close it!

480
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:05,640
All right.

481
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:32,080
To be honest,

482
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:34,520
I am very confused right now.

483
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,640
When a person confesses his feelings,

484
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:39,520
they'd be together if the other says yes.

485
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:42,360
The situation now is
I have already confessed to you,

486
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:43,960
but you have yet to answer me officially.

487
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,080
Last night, we even...

488
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,000
Last night...

489
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:54,440
was because of the ambiance.

490
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,840
We are both consenting adults.

491
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:58,560
I won't take responsibility for you.

492
00:34:58,840 --> 00:34:59,800
That's the first thing.

493
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:01,320
Secondly,

494
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,400
about your confession,

495
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,960
I have to do some serious thinking.

496
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:11,760
How serious?

497
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,760
I have to do some research

498
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,360
on the May-December relationship.

499
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,920
Will the opinions of others
on May-December relationship

500
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,880
affect your answer?

501
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:28,640
Of course.

502
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:30,040
Or else, why would I bother checking?

503
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:35,840
All right, it's working hours now.

504
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:36,960
Go back to your seat.

505
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,400
On Sunday evening,

506
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,360
let's meet at the usual place.

507
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,720
Give me your answer then.

508
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,640
Why are you in such a rush?

509
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:00,360
Of course, I have already hit a home run
and now I have to start over?

510
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:03,600
Sunday evening then.

511
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,040
Also,

512
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:07,240
I will only accept confirmation.

513
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:08,560
No rejection is allowed.

514
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:12,440
You are the one who confessed to me.

515
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:15,760
-Don't I have the right to decide?
-You do.

516
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:18,240
So I'm the one waiting for your answer
and not the other way around.

517
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,440
However...

518
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:23,040
If I am not happy with the answer,

519
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:24,600
I will tell Mr. Li.

520
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:27,280
I will tell him that you abused your power

521
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,320
and sexually harassed your intern.

522
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:32,880
-You--
-Professor He entrusted me to you,

523
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:35,520
yet you sexually harassed me
when I was sick.

524
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,840
How could you say that?

525
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:39,920
Why not?

526
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,200
Didn't you say that I'm young?

527
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:44,560
I am a kid, I can say whatever I want.

528
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:03,480
Don't tell me

529
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:05,600
that the blind date is still on.

530
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,000
How is it? Not bad, right?

531
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,600
Tell the manager
how you want to decorate it.

532
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:51,280
I want to hang fairy lights on the trees
and have white balloons everywhere.

533
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:53,400
I want a flower bouquet.

534
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:56,000
-And--
-And a customized wedding gown

535
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,480
and a wedding banquet.

536
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,640
Please. Can you keep it low profile?

537
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:04,240
Don't turn a love confession
into a wedding.

538
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:07,160
I can't help it.

539
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:08,720
When he looks at me,

540
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:12,240
I already know
which school I'll send our children to.

541
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,040
You are just over 20.

542
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:18,040
You have a long way to go.

543
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:20,720
It's a vast forest, so take a look around

544
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,280
and don't settle for one tree.

545
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:25,800
No, my goal in life is
to marry my prince charming.

546
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:29,160
And then?

547
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:30,720
Take care of his child,

548
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:33,120
do laundry, cook, and tidy up his house?

549
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,680
I can hire a maid for those things.

550
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:38,000
I just have to stay pretty.

551
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,440
If you attract him with beauty,

552
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,760
love shall fade when your beauty does.

553
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:44,760
Have you heard of that?

554
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,320
Uncle.

555
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:51,240
Are you educating me or cursing me?

556
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,320
I am trying to talk some sense into you.

557
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:57,720
You're making him your sun
and making yourself a planet

558
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:58,880
that revolves around him.

559
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:00,160
Then...

560
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,400
What can I do?

561
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,160
I like him.

562
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,280
I like revolving around him.

563
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:10,800
You already are.

564
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:13,520
Now, you're confessing on your birthday
to get a reply?

565
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:17,120
I am 99.9 percent sure
that he doesn't like you.

566
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:20,280
I suggest that you cancel
the public confession

567
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:21,320
and just text him instead.

568
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,040
Don't jinx it!

569
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,800
You are indeed cursing me.

570
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:27,280
I hope you meet a hot girl
on the blind date this weekend

571
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:28,560
and then she dumps you!

572
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:34,240
Just worry about yourself.

573
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:42,920
I wanted to ask you,
but what happened to your nose?

574
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,160
Don't even mention it.

575
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:49,440
I overheard that Ms. Song in my major
and Mr. He from my minor

576
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:50,920
used to be a couple.

577
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:55,120
Worse yet, when I was eavesdropping,
he caught me.

578
00:39:56,640 --> 00:40:00,320
I took Mr. He's class just because
I thought it would be easy to score.

579
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:05,480
Your mom and I never expected
that you would get a scholarship,

580
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,520
but at least try and get a diploma.

581
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:11,160
Stop thinking about it.

582
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:13,080
Everything will work out.

583
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:15,560
I will ask the manager
to get the fairy lights.

584
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,000
Hello, Ms. He.

585
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:26,920
Yes, I met a client this morning.

586
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:28,640
I am downstairs now.

587
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,560
Sure, I will see you later.

588
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:37,240
-Busy day? You are late than usual.
-A little.

589
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:38,640
Luckily, you are here.

590
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,680
I still have to make a delivery
to the office next door.

591
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,880
-I won't go up then. Please sign here.
-Sure.

592
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:46,640
Okay, thank you.

593
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,000
-Sorry, I didn't see you.
-It's fine.

594
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:50,440
I'm sorry.

595
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:54,080
CUTIE ZHENZHEN,
THE RAIN HAS STOPPED, HAVE A GREAT DAY

596
00:40:58,520 --> 00:40:59,640
This is your ocean song bouquet.

597
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:01,160
-Thank you.
-Okay, bye.

598
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:05,080
GORGEOUS CONG XIAO,
THE RAIN HAS STOPPED, HAVE A GREAT DAY

599
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:40,520
