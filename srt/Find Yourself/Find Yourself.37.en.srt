1
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,160
So you're saying that
Minmin ran away from home?

2
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,840
She wouldn't dare to do that.

3
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,280
She's at her friend's house.

4
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:18,960
It's too confusing.

5
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,080
I don't care anymore.

6
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,480
Let them be.

7
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,240
A baby with an old baby.

8
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,680
They won't be together for long.

9
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:31,000
But don't let Caiwei and my parents
find out about this.

10
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,640
If we get married one day,

11
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,960
it will be so awkward.

12
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,320
Did my sister say anything?

13
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,240
What do you mean?

14
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,480
-Hello.
-She wants me to get married

15
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,520
and have kids soon.

16
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,800
-So,
-Hall eight.

17
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,840
please don't take
whatever she said seriously.

18
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:52,960
No.

19
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,040
I know what she meant.

20
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,680
Besides, it's not about what she said.

21
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,000
But if we continue
seeing each other like this

22
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,360
and everything works out fine,

23
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,200
we'll eventually get married, right?

24
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,880
Yes,

25
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,280
but this isn't what I wanted to hear.

26
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,320
You asked me to view houses with you.

27
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:24,880
Weren't you trying to hint that
we should get married soon?

28
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,800
Yes.

29
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,040
But that's...

30
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,920
That's what I meant, but I...

31
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,560
Good then.

32
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,000
You know my dad's condition very well.

33
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,960
One day, he might not
recognize anyone anymore.

34
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,640
He might not even remember his own family.

35
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,440
Even though he has never said this to me,

36
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:55,400
I know he longs to hold my hand

37
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:58,000
and walk me down the aisle.

38
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,440
So we're on the same page.

39
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,880
We both want to get married
as soon as possible.

40
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,040
Okay.

41
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,520
Since we have the same aim,
let's strive hard together.

42
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,680
-Go for it!
-Go for it!

43
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,480
-Yes.
-Let's get inside!

44
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:35,040
Summary.

45
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,440
The movie

46
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,520
was really

47
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,520
awful.

48
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,360
Let's

49
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,480
strive hard

50
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:57,800
for our

51
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,080
wedding day.

52
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,480
Go for it!

53
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,200
Hello. I'm an architect from Aijia.
My name is Luo Wenyue.

54
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,880
I'm here to see Chang Huan and Yuan Song.

55
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,000
This way, please.

56
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,800
These are the designers,
Chang Huan and Yuan Song.

57
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:41,920
How are you?

58
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,240
We've talked before. I'm Luo Wenyue.

59
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,800
Hello, I'm Chang Huan.

60
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,960
Hello, Yuan Song.
Ms. Wu talked about you a lot.

61
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,320
-Hi.
-Hi.

62
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,960
The meeting room is occupied right now.

63
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,560
-Let's talk in the guest room.
-Okay.

64
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,840
Let's go.

65
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,040
What are you looking at?

66
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,640
I just talked to a friend
who works at the headquarters.

67
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:17,280
This Luo Wenyue is a star over there.

68
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,600
She has worked abroad.

69
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:21,360
She has received a design award
in Singapore.

70
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,320
And she's only 27.

71
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,880
I guess the headquarters
isn't an easy place.

72
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,440
She is young, talented
and quite the looker.

73
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:33,000
Look at how happy the boys are.

74
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,960
You're right.

75
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:38,680
He just got discharged.
Now he's grinning from ear to ear.

76
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,840
Be careful or you might just reopen
the stitches from all that laughing.

77
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,680
Men are so fickle.

78
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,480
They're happy when they see pretty women.

79
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,360
I don't find her that pretty at all.

80
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:54,320
Look at how thick her double eyelids are.
They must be fake.

81
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,280
Really? Are they fake?

82
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,600
No wonder they look so nice.

83
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,680
You can become pretty
as long as you're rich.

84
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,080
Beauty is worthless already.

85
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,840
I want to be worthless too.

86
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:22,520
After a bear has its claws trimmed,
what will it turn into?

87
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,360
-A bear getting its claws trimmed?
-Yes.

88
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,960
What is it?

89
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:32,600
Even a well-paid beauty like her
would eat in a canteen?

90
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,320
Look at how happy Yuan Song is.

91
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,080
Of course, just look at her.

92
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,440
"Look at my luscious, wavy hair."

93
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:45,280
Of course little boys would be attracted
to older women like that.

94
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,320
Let me introduce everyone.

95
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,760
This is Bai from administration
and Cong Xiao from marketing.

96
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,440
This is Luo Wenyue,
an architect from the headquarters.

97
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,320
-Hello, Bai.
-Hi.

98
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,200
Cong Xiao? I've heard a lot about you.

99
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,880
You've snatched many projects from Aijia.
You're very pretty.

100
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,320
You flatter me. Please take a seat.

101
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:14,240
Yuan Song, why don't you sit here?

102
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,960
All right.

103
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,080
Thank you.

104
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,880
The environment here is great.

105
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,720
You guys seem to be really close.

106
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,800
The headquarters is so uptight.

107
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,840
We might not even see
our colleagues for months

108
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,640
when they go on business trips.

109
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:32,679
Our administrative director
recently resigned.

110
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,120
And we're going to move offices.

111
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,240
Everybody has been slacking off.

112
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:40,120
We used to be very serious
when we were working.

113
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,960
Everything has been affected this quickly?

114
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,320
You can ask Yuan Song.

115
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,600
He knows it best.

116
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,440
Both he and the director
were like cat and mouse.

117
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,000
She always checked on him without fail.

118
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,800
Don't bad-mouth He Fanxing now.

119
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,040
Look at him.

120
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,520
He's calling her name so casually already.

121
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,000
No manners at all.

122
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,640
You're such a bad boy.

123
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,240
I want to eat this.

124
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,960
They look so happy.

125
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,680
What are you looking at?

126
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,600
Ms. He brought the boss some food.

127
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,520
Get on with your work.

128
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,600
Okay.

129
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,960
They might not look too good.

130
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,520
But my mom made the filling,
so it's definitely good.

131
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,840
So you folded the skin?

132
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,760
My dad did.

133
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35,760
So you just stuffed the filling,
but you're still being smug?

134
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:39,360
You excitedly told me to try your cooking.

135
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,360
You are

136
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,520
both encouraging me while humiliating me.

137
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,720
I'll strive harder.

138
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:57,840
Ms. He Fanxing,

139
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:02,840
I don't think you need to try too hard
to do something you're not good at.

140
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,920
In my opinion,

141
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:08,240
ordering takeout for me

142
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,920
is just as sincere as cooking for me.

143
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,080
But my mom said learning more skills
won't do any harm.

144
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,480
I agree with her.

145
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,880
Since I'm free, I should learn.

146
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:23,080
Perhaps you're getting old,

147
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:26,080
since you're starting
to agree with your mom.

148
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:34,200
I wish we never grow old.

149
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,320
We would have so much time.

150
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:40,520
Then we won't have to rush things
and be afraid of mistakes.

151
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,640
That isn't something to worry about.

152
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,960
You have a pretty high tolerance
for mistakes.

153
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:57,280
<i>If a person's tolerance for mistakes
increases year after year,</i>

154
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:59,600
<i>it would reach its peak
when he is around 20 years old</i>

155
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,840
<i>and graduates from university.</i>

156
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,280
<i>From then on, it would decrease gradually.</i>

157
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,600
<i>When one is over 30 years old,</i>

158
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:10,280
<i>the tolerance would decrease drastically
year after year.</i>

159
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,680
-Fanxing.
-Long time no see.

160
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,480
-Fanxing, hello.
-Fanxing!

161
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,000
Why are you here?

162
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,520
Bai said the inventory
doesn't tally with the accounts.

163
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,520
I'm here to help.

164
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:24,200
Come with me. There's a new gossip.

165
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,200
Over there.

166
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:31,040
That's Luo Wenyue,
an architect from the headquarters.

167
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,080
She's here to help
with the homestay project.

168
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,200
She has been seducing Yuan Song
the whole day.

169
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:40,520
Like this, "I can't finish the egg.
Can you help me?"

170
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,200
"I don't like wasting food."

171
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,920
-This is more elegant.
-Better than this.

172
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,680
They look good together.

173
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,840
He was still pining for you
a few days ago.

174
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,040
Look at this.

175
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,360
Men.

176
00:11:58,760 --> 00:11:59,680
Fanxing!

177
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,680
He Fanxing! You're finally here!

178
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,320
I can't handle it on my own.

179
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,880
-It's okay, I'm here to help.
-All right.

180
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,960
Any idea for decorations?

181
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,720
I'm thinking about using glass.

182
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:19,080
Besides the aesthetic value,
we should take cost into account too.

183
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,800
What do you think, Yuan Song?

184
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,960
I'm sorry, what were you saying?

185
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,120
You're daydreaming again.

186
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,760
It's about the walls.

187
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:38,320
There's a duplicate order.

188
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,280
Did you order all of them?

189
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,280
How could you let this slip by you?

190
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,120
I've been careless.

191
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,880
You've been working half-heartedly.

192
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,840
What's distracting you?

193
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:54,320
If this goes on, you'll come in last
at the headquarters.

194
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:55,840
Please understand.

195
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,760
I just broke up with my boyfriend.

196
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,040
You just broke up?

197
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,520
What happened?

198
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,960
I thought we got along well.

199
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,440
We were a good match
in terms of age and other things.

200
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,760
But his ex came back.

201
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:12,960
His ex-girlfriend?

202
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,520
Someone told me

203
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,160
that exes are like ghosts.

204
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:22,160
You usually can't see or sense them,

205
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,600
but they'd be back
during the Ghost Festival.

206
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,600
And what happened? She really came back.

207
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,160
So he broke up with you because of that?

208
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,520
You mean he dumped me? Never.

209
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,400
He was still seeing me

210
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:39,400
when he reminisced about
the good old times with his ex at a bar.

211
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:40,960
He was a two-timer.

212
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,480
If I didn't find out sooner,

213
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:45,280
a big, green beanstalk

214
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:49,400
would grow out of my head
and reach the sky!

215
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,960
People would be able to climb up
and steal golden eggs.

216
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,360
He told me they were just good friends.

217
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,280
They even came together
to explain it to me.

218
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:00,920
It was like I was the queen
who tore them apart.

219
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:01,960
Ridiculous.

220
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:05,960
So did he really betray you?

221
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:06,960
Hey.

222
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:10,520
His ex asked him out for a drink
and he went out with her.

223
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,720
That's a red flag!

224
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,360
He wasn't over her yet.

225
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:17,880
To top it off, she wasn't any other ex.

226
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,560
She was his first love.

227
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:24,800
If exes are as powerful as a time bomb,

228
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,160
then the power of a first love
is equivalent to an atomic bomb!

229
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,280
It depends.

230
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:36,560
Yes, it depends. On her looks.

231
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,880
His ex-girlfriend has a great body.

232
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:43,440
And she can last very long in bed.

233
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,160
It was pointless.

234
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,880
That's why I chose to leave.

235
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:53,000
It was to avoid
getting myself betrayed again.

236
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,120
He Fanxing, you're here.

237
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:04,000
I'm here to help Bai out.

238
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,320
I'll leave soon.

239
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,360
Why are you so rude?

240
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:11,400
I thought the receptionist
has been bringing you beverages.

241
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,800
Why are you here?

242
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:15,080
Luo Wenyue has only been here for a day,

243
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,960
but you've been buttering her up
the whole time.

244
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,840
What do you mean?
I'm bringing Chang Huan some water too.

245
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,400
Hey.

246
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,720
What do you think about Luo Wenyue?

247
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:26,560
She's nice.

248
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:30,560
That's not my question. Is she your type?

249
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:36,640
She's not bad.

250
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,600
We both like the same Japanese architect.

251
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:42,240
You know what?
I have a good eye for women.

252
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:46,000
That Luo Wenyue might look
poised and elegant,

253
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:49,120
but I'm very sure
she's an aggressive carnivore.

254
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,000
You'll be tricked into going to a hotel
with her if you're careless.

255
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,720
I think you have the wrong idea
about Luo Wenyue.

256
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,040
What carnivore?

257
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,360
You're siding with her now?

258
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,280
You're still too green.

259
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:02,840
What a pity.

260
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,320
I'm leaving. You should get back to work.

261
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,800
You're leaving already? Stay for a while.

262
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:10,760
I can't. Come to my place
for dinner this weekend.

263
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,160
-All right. Bye.
-I should go. Bye.

264
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,240
Bye.

265
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,400
It's this way. Let me walk you out.

266
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,480
It's fine.

267
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:26,240
When one is unlucky,
one can really hit rock bottom.

268
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,480
How could you get caught by your aunt?

269
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,000
How would I know?

270
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,600
I even argued with my uncle over that.

271
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,840
I could have whined and got it over with.

272
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:41,640
Maybe I really thought

273
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:45,560
that I was independent as I was able
to make money on my own.

274
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,280
You're crazy.

275
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,360
Yuan Song.

276
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:59,360
You're not mad at me for not telling you
about Professor He and me, right?

277
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,960
You should know.

278
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:06,280
Our relationship is complicated, isn't it?

279
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:10,319
It's a small world, right?

280
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,480
And it's crazy, right?

281
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,119
You're right.

282
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,079
Let's toast to that.

283
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,720
Seriously, both of you.

284
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:25,800
How could you two be so entangled
with the He family?

285
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:30,560
Do the He siblings have superpowers?

286
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
It's because they're good-looking.

287
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:36,280
So? They can have their way
just because they have pretty faces?

288
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,880
Of course they can.

289
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,800
Aren't you always ordering me
around yourself?

290
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:47,640
The way you try to compliment a girl
is very old-fashioned!

291
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,400
Old-fashioned.

292
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,240
Big Head is right.

293
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,720
You two insisted to have supper here

294
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,360
and filled my house
with this smell of cumin.

295
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:56,840
I couldn't even object to this.

296
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,280
You're getting away with this
all because of your pretty faces.

297
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,520
You're right.

298
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,160
Here's to you, Yuan Song.

299
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,200
Please don't hesitate to ask me for help
when you need it.

300
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,760
Let me fill up
the blank space in your life.

301
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,720
It's too much, isn't it?

302
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:27,720
Why should we be looked down on
just because we're young?

303
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,080
Do we look that unreliable?

304
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:36,040
Why don't they believe in our love?

305
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:39,240
I can get married
and have kids right away too.

306
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,640
I can earn 200 yuan a day at work.

307
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,440
This shall not persist!

308
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,520
No!

309
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,120
We should love ourselves first.

310
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,680
Love ourselves!

311
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,360
If we don't love ourselves,

312
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,480
we'll turn into other people's shadows!

313
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,880
I don't want to be a shadow.

314
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,360
I want to be myself.

315
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,440
You have to leave the past behind too,
Yuan Song.

316
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,680
Yes! Leave the past behind and be myself!

317
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,360
Cheers!

318
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,280
Summary.

319
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,560
I made

320
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:36,080
dumplings by myself.

321
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,080
Relationship progress.

322
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:53,720
Relationship progress...

323
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:57,200
Is she your type?

324
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:00,720
She's not bad.

325
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,720
We both like the same Japanese architect.

326
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:06,520
You know what?
I have a good eye for women.

327
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:10,280
That Luo Wenyue might look
poised and elegant,

328
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:13,280
but I'm very sure
she's an aggressive carnivore.

329
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:16,320
You'll be tricked into going to a hotel
with her if you're careless.

330
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,960
Stop thinking about it, He Fanxing!

331
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,800
It's none of your business!

332
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:24,880
Go to bed!

333
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:41,000
Is this green bean shaved ice
really that nice?

334
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,800
You just had a huge bowl of it.

335
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,840
Are you not afraid
you'd get a stomachache?

336
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:47,280
No, Mrs. He. My stomach is tough.

337
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,200
Your Professor He is back.

338
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,200
Why are you here?

339
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,160
I'm here to see Mr. He.

340
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,640
She bought us fruits and beverages.

341
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:08,560
Minmin told us
she has started earning money.

342
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,480
You're a good girl.

343
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,080
I'll pay you a visit whenever I'm free.

344
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:16,280
The water-soluble C100 contains vitamin C.
It's good for you.

345
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:17,920
Really? I see.

346
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,080
What have you been up to lately?

347
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,400
I've been working of course.

348
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:25,840
Are you staying with a friend?

349
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,600
Even my elementary school teacher
isn't as inquisitive.

350
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,240
Hey!

351
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,720
I bought this for Mr. He.

352
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,320
Can I have a bottle, Dad?

353
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,240
-Well--
-Thanks, Dad.

354
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,160
He Canyang,

355
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,840
did you criticize Minmin again?

356
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,080
No.

357
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,760
I've told you

358
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,160
not to put on airs in front of Minmin.

359
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,560
Don't throw your weight around
as her lecturer.

360
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,760
After your sister is married to Luming,

361
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:58,520
Minmin will be your niece.

362
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,240
No.

363
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,080
I don't want to be his niece.

364
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:06,320
Did you hear that?

365
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:08,320
She doesn't want to be your niece.

366
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,800
Look at how annoying you are.

367
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:13,000
I didn't mean that, Mrs. He.

368
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,760
You too, Minmin.

369
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,800
Your mom calls me that.

370
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,600
You should call me Grandma He.

371
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,080
And call him Grandpa He.

372
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:30,320
But it's weird to call you
Grandma and Grandpa.

373
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,800
It's a bit confusing.

374
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,480
No, she is right.

375
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:36,200
Listen, we need to follow the hierarchy.

376
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,440
I have to get to work, Mr. and Mrs. He.

377
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:44,160
-I'm leaving.
-Have breakfast first!

378
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:47,000
No. I start at 10:30 a.m. I have to go.

379
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,080
I'll take her to work, Mom.

380
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,160
Go.

381
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:54,720
Take care!

382
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,200
Hey.

383
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:19,880
Are you still angry?

384
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:25,600
Please mind your behavior in public, sir.

385
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,880
That Canyang.

386
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,960
He forgot his car keys.

387
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,680
He'll get Alzheimer's too
when he gets older.

388
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,160
Perhaps Alzheimer's is hereditary.

389
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:48,880
As long as it's not contagious.

390
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,560
I'll bring it to him.

391
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:51,840
Okay.

392
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,720
I forgot my car keys. I'll go get it.

393
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:06,800
You're the one who is wrong,
but why should I come to you?

394
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,320
Because you're kind and cute.

395
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,840
You're correct.

396
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:16,400
I wanted to see you,
but I'm reflecting on my actions.

397
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,360
Are you?

398
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,640
What did you do wrong?

399
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:25,640
You're too perfect
to commit any mistakes, aren't you?

400
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,600
Of course not.

401
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:31,120
I'll make mistakes even when I'm 80,
let alone now.

402
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,480
But we should reflect on ourselves

403
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:35,280
or we'll make the same mistakes again.

404
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,440
That's not wrong.

405
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,480
Tell me about your mistake then.

406
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:48,520
I'll decide whether to forgive you or not.

407
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:51,280
I'm very popular
at the restaurant I'm working at.

408
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:54,080
Many of my male colleagues like me.

409
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,960
Okay. I sincerely apologize to you.

410
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,200
I shouldn't

411
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:07,320
date you with the assumption
that we'd break up.

412
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:10,160
It's as if our love
is infested with cancer,

413
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:14,280
where after we enjoy good meals,
good drinks and good times,

414
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:15,480
the two of us would part.

415
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,680
At least you know that now.

416
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,240
Also, my sister and your uncle

417
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:24,360
don't need to make way for us.

418
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,600
We don't need them to make way either.

419
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:29,240
We shall just carry on with our lives.

420
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:34,520
Are you satisfied with
my reflection speech?

421
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,040
It was okay.

422
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,920
Even though you haven't reflected enough,

423
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:43,480
everything is rather on point.

424
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:48,680
My girlfriend is so adorable.

425
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:51,360
Please be serious. I really mean it.

426
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:52,840
Okay.

427
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,520
Why so serious?

428
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,680
You can't ignore me ever again
even if we fight.

429
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,400
Fine. I won't.

430
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:36,080
Ma'am, I only have an hour.
What should we eat?

431
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,280
Dumplings. The one below my office.

432
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,400
Okay.

433
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,280
What happened to your finger?

434
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,080
At the florist course earlier...

435
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:52,160
Does it hurt?

436
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,160
You should take a break.

437
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,360
Please come again.

438
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,360
You have a visa to Japan.

439
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:08,560
I can sponsor your trip.

440
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,360
I got my visa done together
with Professor Song.

441
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,880
We planned to travel
when she's on holiday.

442
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,040
And now,

443
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,560
she can't go anymore.

444
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:22,200
We'll just wait.

445
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:27,280
There will never be a right time
if you keep on waiting.

446
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:31,920
It's just like a freelancer
who will never have real freedom.

447
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,360
But you impress me.

448
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:35,960
You're really taking the initiative.

449
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:38,720
Now you're taking florist courses
for your store.

450
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,760
I used to visit that florist.

451
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,760
The owner and I know each other.

452
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:46,160
I'm planning to help at her flower shop

453
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,480
and gain experience at the same time.

454
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:51,480
Come and be my deputy manager.

455
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,560
I don't want to be in administrative work.

456
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,360
Are you trying to avoid a management job

457
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,760
or me?

458
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:11,720
Is it weird for me to avoid
taking up a management job?

459
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,800
You're great at it.
Why are you giving it up?

460
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:19,960
Don't worry.

461
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:24,000
Even if we break up one day,

462
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,560
it won't affect your job.

463
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:29,640
I'm no longer an emotional 20-year-old.

464
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:39,280
You sound like you're trying to nitpick.

465
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:44,760
I'm not nitpicking.

466
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:49,880
I'm getting rid of the snake in the grass
and giving you a better choice.

467
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,880
Firstly, it's not easy
to run a store of your own.

468
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:54,640
After deducting costs,

469
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,960
you might not earn as much as you did
when you were a director.

470
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:00,400
With your dad's condition,

471
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,200
you'll need more money.

472
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:09,280
I want to open a flower shop.

473
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:12,960
I'm just doing
what I've always wanted to do.

474
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,600
It's not related to anything else.

475
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:19,640
Okay.

476
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,520
If this is what you like,

477
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,240
I'll support you unconditionally.

478
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,560
If you need money,

479
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,040
I have some.

480
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:30,600
I'll definitely try my best to earn money.

481
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:33,280
Besides, I still have my brother

482
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,720
and my parents still have their pension.

483
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,760
Didn't you quit?
You still come here to eat.

484
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:06,480
Can't I come here to eat after I've quit?

485
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,600
Just saying.

486
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,120
Your girlfriend?

487
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:17,080
This is my colleague
from the headquarters.

488
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:19,560
She's my ex-boss, He Fanxing.

489
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:22,240
He's Mr. Ye from the ad agency
we work with.

490
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,760
Hello, I'm Luo Wenyue.

491
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,000
Hello.

492
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,400
I'll leave you to your lunch.

493
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:32,080
We have a meeting after lunch.

494
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,160
They look good together.

495
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,200
They do.

496
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:00,720
That girl is quite pretty.

497
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,800
He doesn't seem to loathe me as much now.

498
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,040
Isn't that good?

499
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:11,480
It is.

500
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:12,960
He has finally let go.

501
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:14,720
Yes.

502
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:16,880
That's normal.

503
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,720
Whoever meets a girl like Luo Wenyue

504
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:23,800
would definitely let go
of an old woman like me.

505
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,920
Why do I sense anger?

506
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:29,880
Why would I be angry?

507
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,360
It's just a normal conversation.

508
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:36,440
That's right. Why would you be angry?

509
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,880
The problem is

510
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,400
I'm not angry.

511
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,320
Then why are you clenching the cup?

512
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,840
Your finger is bleeding.

513
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:58,040
Your hand.

514
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:03,240
Check your hand first.
I'll clean the table.

515
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:10,640
You're eating with me.
Why are you staring at them?

516
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,360
My ex-boss is pretty.

517
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:17,160
Who's prettier? Your ex-boss or me?

518
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:18,640
She is prettier, of course.

519
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:24,960
So is your ex-boss

520
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,760
or your ex-girlfriend prettier?

521
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:30,080
How can I compare?

522
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,840
No wonder Ms. Wu said

523
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:35,720
that you're not over your ex yet.

524
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,680
No. It is in the past.

525
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:43,040
Since she didn't choose me,
I shouldn't hang on to her

526
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,400
and make her hate me instead.

527
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,320
People who hound others
are undoubtedly annoying.

528
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:49,960
It's harassment.

529
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:54,040
But an infatuation at a proper distance,

530
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:55,720
that's a killer move.

531
00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:01,440
Even an outsider would be moved by it.

532
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:03,000
I see.

533
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,520
Yuan Song, why don't we give it a try?

534
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,600
-Try what?
-Let's date each other.

535
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:14,120
Use a new relationship
to move on from the old one.

536
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,640
Do you mind that I'm five years older?

537
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:20,200
-Age is not an issue.
-Let's try then!

538
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:22,160
Then do you mind that
I have someone else on my mind?

539
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,040
Not at all.

540
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:44,080
TO IMPROVE RELATIONSHIP,
LEARN TO MAKE DUMPLINGS

541
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,440
YUAN SONG

542
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,440
Luckily, the owner has band-aids.

543
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:21,960
He gave me one.

544
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:27,719
What's wrong?

545
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:32,000
It's nothing.

546
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:35,320
I just realized I have a meeting.

547
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:36,960
I have to go back to the office.

548
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,080
I can't take you home.

549
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:40,600
It's fine.

550
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:42,040
What time will you get off work?

551
00:34:43,639 --> 00:34:44,600
I'm not sure.

552
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:48,159
Give me a call when you're done.

553
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,040
Let's take the dog for a walk at the park.

554
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,800
We don't have to meet twice a day.

555
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:59,360
After work tonight, I want...

556
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,200
I want to get some rest at home.

557
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:04,240
I'm leaving.

558
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:40,520
Hello, Minmin? What's the matter?

559
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,760
What? My mom saw you two?

560
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:49,480
He's not answering my calls.
I'm worried to death!

561
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:52,400
Your mom was so furious,
as if she'd eat him alive.

562
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,400
I was so scared.

563
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:56,200
Will he get beaten up
and end up in a hospital?

564
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,120
It will be fine. Don't worry.

565
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:01,120
I'll go home right now
and give you a call after, okay?

566
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,520
Okay.

567
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:18,720
Mom.

568
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:19,960
He Canyang.

569
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,800
Have your dad and I

570
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:24,520
ever interfered with your life
after you've grown up?

571
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:29,440
Your dad always says that
there are all sorts of people.

572
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,160
One must have their own character.

573
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:34,240
As long as you abide by the rules
and don't hurt anyone,

574
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,160
you can live however you want!

575
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,800
But there are things that you can't do!

576
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:41,320
Mom,

577
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:44,680
I know the relationships in our family
are complicated right now.

578
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,760
Then why did you do it?

579
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:50,360
How should our families face each other?

580
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:53,040
Minmin is immature,
but should you be immature as well?

581
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:55,400
Mom, I've thought about all that.

582
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:57,400
But Minmin and I love each other.

583
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:58,480
"Love?"

584
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:03,360
Can your love last more than three months?

585
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:07,720
You're happy for sure,
but have you thought about others?

586
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:08,960
Mom!

587
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:12,040
You're exaggerating.
I'm just dating someone.

588
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:14,280
Enough. Cut it out.

589
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:17,040
Canyang.

590
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:20,480
Before things get worse
between the two families,

591
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,080
break up with Minmin.

592
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:27,000
Dad, I promise
I won't bring trouble to He Fanxing.

593
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:28,120
You promise?

594
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:31,160
What can you promise?
How can you be so selfish?

595
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:34,240
Say something!

596
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,080
Honestly,

597
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,120
you're biased.

598
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,520
You always prefer He Fanxing over me.

599
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:45,400
You think she's more obedient
and mature than me.

600
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:48,960
I even have to give in to her
when it comes to dating.

601
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:52,800
How could you say that?

602
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:55,080
You're the one at fault!

603
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,760
If we wanted an obedient one,

604
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:59,680
we could have just kept a dog!

605
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:01,880
How could you be so unconscionable?

606
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,400
Am I unconscionable for dating someone?

607
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,520
Am I unconscionable
for not giving in to Fanxing?

608
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:09,520
Since you love her so much, just have her!
Why did you bother to have me?

609
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,000
How could I have this kind of son?

610
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:22,720
Fine.

611
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:25,320
I won't fight with you anymore.

612
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:27,480
Your dad is ill.

613
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,520
I won't fight with you.

614
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:31,560
Get out.

615
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:33,960
Get lost!

616
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,360
It's all right.

617
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,320
Calm down.

618
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,160
Both of you were angry.

619
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:49,360
Those words were meaningless.
Don't take it to heart.

620
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:53,320
He said that I'm biased.

621
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,960
He isn't wrong.

622
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:07,240
How can you still laugh?

623
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,720
How could you laugh?

624
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:25,240
<i>The door is open. Please enter.</i>

625
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,280
Mom, Dad!

626
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:35,600
-The wine.
-Take it away.

627
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:39,760
We will stop eating now.

628
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,040
I only had two.

629
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:48,040
But this green tea flavored
Besheen Liquour tastes amazing.

630
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:50,000
I'll buy you two bottles in the future.

631
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:55,040
We drank wine and ate meat.

632
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:57,320
You said you only had two,

633
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:00,880
but look at the chicken bones
in front of you.

634
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,320
Two?

635
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:06,760
Mom, Dad.

636
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:10,520
Are you all right?

637
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:13,680
We are. Why wouldn't we be?

638
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:16,680
Where is He Canyang?

639
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,360
Who is He Canyang?

640
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,520
Is he one of us?

641
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:25,880
We only have a daughter.

642
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:29,200
We followed the one-child policy

643
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,680
and had only one child.

644
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:31,800
Right?

645
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,240
Maybe.

646
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:35,680
See?

647
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:37,680
Your dad said so.

648
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:48,240
Canyang.

649
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,040
He Canyang!

650
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,160
He Canyang?

651
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:56,440
Where is he?

652
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:06,600
HE FANXING

653
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,960
-Hello?
-Hello, where are you?

654
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:13,120
<i>Why didn't you answer Minmin's calls?
Call her back!</i>

655
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:14,840
I already did.

656
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,040
Mom and Dad were scolding me.

657
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:19,320
A sinner shouldn't be
answering a call, right?

658
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,440
<i>I'm sorry. I just got home.</i>

659
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:24,680
<i>They were eating fried chicken chops!</i>

660
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:26,760
<i>I've become their only child.</i>

661
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,320
Fried chicken chop?

662
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:30,320
What about their cholesterol levels?

663
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:34,080
<i>So how did you get caught by Mom?</i>

664
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:37,000
I couldn't hide it as well as you did.
I apologize!

665
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:40,280
<i>Why are you yelling at me?
I didn't expose you!</i>

666
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:42,960
How could I dare yell at you?

667
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:45,240
You're the only child of the He family.

668
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:46,720
I was adopted!

669
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,920
Why should I give in to you
when it comes to dating as well?

670
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:51,160
<i>Who wants you to give in for me?</i>

671
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:53,720
<i>How could you take
an angry person seriously?</i>

672
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:55,000
<i>As their children,</i>

673
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:57,440
<i>we should take care
of our parents' feelings.</i>

674
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:59,200
See?

675
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:01,280
Now I know why they're biased.

676
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:04,600
You're so understanding.
Mom and Dad have always preferred you.

677
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:05,840
They don't like me.

678
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,240
<i>He Canyang! Stop spouting nonsense!</i>

679
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:10,480
I'm not. Look at you.

680
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:12,560
You hid your relationship with Yuan Song.

681
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:16,000
Now that you've found someone they like,
they're rushing to get you married!

682
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:20,280
Since you're obedient and understanding,
they can tell how ridiculous I am.

683
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:22,360
<i>Fine.</i>

684
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:23,600
What do you mean by that?

685
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,520
<i>Suit yourself!</i>

686
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,200
<i>You can think whatever you want,</i>

687
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:29,600
<i>and say whatever hurtful words you want.</i>

688
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:32,400
<i>Just ignore how much your words hurt me!</i>

689
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:34,840
<i>Because you know no matter how upset I am,</i>

690
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:38,080
<i>I'd still forgive you
and forget about what you said.</i>

691
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:40,800
<i>It has always been like this
since we were kids!</i>

692
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:53,400
