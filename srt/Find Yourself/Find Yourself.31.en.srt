1
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:00,840
Well,

2
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:04,240
He Fanxing's boyfriend
had breakfast at my house.

3
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:07,320
He had to work through the night,
so he asked me to go to school...

4
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,760
It's true! He really came
for breakfast this morning.

5
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,360
He had to do overtime and asked me
to pick up his niece at school.

6
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,880
She had luggage, so I carried it for her.

7
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,280
That's because
my sister's boyfriend's niece

8
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,000
is also my niece.

9
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,080
We're relatives. I should help her.

10
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,320
-I helped her.
-You were just helping?

11
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,800
Of course. What else can it be?

12
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,440
He Canyang, don't give me that crap.

13
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,200
I know you better than your mom!

14
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,640
The two people you can't fool
in this world

15
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,680
are your sister and me.

16
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,160
"Niece"?

17
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,760
Your relationships are all messed up!

18
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,880
I didn't mean to lie.

19
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,320
I'm worried that if I make it public,
things will get complicated.

20
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,480
She's young and playful.

21
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,680
My passion for love is always brief.

22
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,480
I'm having fun with her now.

23
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,720
It could be months or a year at most
before we break up.

24
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:09,160
That's why we both agreed
to not announce our relationship

25
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,800
when it isn't stable.

26
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:23,160
When did you start drinking coke?

27
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,720
Have you considered
switching universities?

28
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,440
What?

29
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,160
Didn't an art institute approach you?

30
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:32,280
You can apply for a transfer
and start next term.

31
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,680
We're keeping this a secret.

32
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,480
There's no need for any transfer.

33
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,960
Think this through.

34
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,360
If I can notice it, anyone else can.

35
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,840
It's impossible to keep it a secret.

36
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,920
If you two wish to be together
for a long time,

37
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,240
you really should apply for a transfer
so that you won't be her lecturer.

38
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,680
Decide for yourself, I can't help much.

39
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,120
All right, I'll think about it.

40
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,880
You're not here
to talk about this, are you?

41
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,640
In fact, you look a little upset.

42
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:25,760
There's a date displayed on the wall
of the dance studio in this picture.

43
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,200
It was two days ago.

44
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,760
Someone sent this to my Weibo.

45
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,800
He knows I'm Shen Fanfan's
wife's best friend,

46
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,680
he's asking me to forward it to her.

47
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,760
Once a cheater, always a cheater.

48
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,200
What's the motive of the sender?

49
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,160
He must be from the dance studio.

50
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,520
I don't know his motive.

51
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,000
Just wait and see.

52
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,360
Song Xue, you're good at this!

53
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,320
You taught me well.

54
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,520
Mom, is this good?

55
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,760
Go easy on the fillings.

56
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:21,000
Fold it up and make sure they stick.

57
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,400
Now, this is finally acceptable.

58
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,160
Mom, Dad, I'm home!

59
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,000
Song Xue is here?

60
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,360
Miss me?

61
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:30,920
I do.

62
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:34,000
I brought Besheen Liquour for you.
It's in the fridge.

63
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,320
I love you!

64
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,960
Fanxing, how is
that colleague of yours doing?

65
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,800
I gave him a few days off.

66
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,400
He went home for his medical card
and went to a hospital.

67
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:51,240
He'll be admitted into the hospital
if he really needs surgery.

68
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,760
You guys continue, I'll go get changed.

69
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,000
-Hurry up.
-Okay.

70
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,000
Mom, where's Dad?

71
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,520
Senior college has started.

72
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,920
He's teaching calligraphy.

73
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,720
I see he wants some extra income.

74
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,320
What about you two?

75
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,000
Any plans for summer break?

76
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:21,680
I need to continue my show
and write a book as well.

77
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,760
There could be another show
that I'll be in.

78
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,080
It's still being discussed though.

79
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,640
I'll work out.

80
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,400
When she's famous, I'll be her bodyguard.

81
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,120
Thanks.

82
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,240
Hey.

83
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,160
You shouldn't help.

84
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,080
You're hot-tempered.

85
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,040
The dumplings you make
will be crushed instead.

86
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,960
The only thing I want to crush is you.

87
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,720
Mind your manners!

88
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,320
One should learn if one doesn't know.

89
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:51,440
You have to learn the right way to do it.
I'll teach you.

90
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,480
Fold it up like this.

91
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,680
And then turn it over.

92
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,200
Lastly, stick them together.

93
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:02,640
And here comes a pretty little dumpling!

94
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,200
Look at this.

95
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,760
I know that. You've taught me before.

96
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,720
Fold it up like this, right?

97
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,080
Press it like this

98
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,560
and then turn it over like...

99
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,360
It looks a little bad,

100
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,640
but here comes a cute little dumpling!

101
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,400
What did I say?

102
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,720
I give up, happy now?
I give up! I'm bad at this.

103
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,080
Calm down.

104
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:35,040
I'll teach you again.

105
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,960
If you marry Luming in the future,

106
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,600
when his family is making dumplings,

107
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,920
it would be such a shame
if you don't know how to make them.

108
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,440
You think too much, Mom!

109
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,880
We just started dating.

110
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,400
It's too soon to talk about marriage.

111
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:53,640
Well, learning more skills
doesn't harm anyone, right?

112
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,000
Mom, listen.

113
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,600
Don't invite Ye Luming over
for dinner too often.

114
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,640
He'd buy things for us all the time.

115
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,800
I already told him that.

116
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,400
He just wouldn't listen.

117
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,440
Take yesterday for example.

118
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,760
He stayed up all night at the studio.

119
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:17,760
But he couldn't get any rest
because he had to come here for dinner.

120
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,920
She cares about him so much.

121
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,600
She can't suppress it.

122
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,760
Cut it out, you two.

123
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,440
Driving while fatigued is dangerous.

124
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,960
This is about safety.

125
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:33,640
All right.

126
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,480
Don't worry.

127
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,559
I know the importance of safety.

128
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,360
He looked tired.

129
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,200
So I didn't let him go home.

130
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,960
I had him rest in your room.

131
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,200
I woke him up at noon.

132
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:49,200
And only let him leave after he had lunch.

133
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,480
Mom, did you even make him lunch?

134
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,080
You're spoiling him too much!

135
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,320
Mom.

136
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,680
You let him enter my room,

137
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:00,080
and sleep on my bed?

138
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,040
Yes.

139
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,320
I haven't changed the bedsheet.
I'll change it later.

140
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,320
Mom!

141
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:12,120
How could you let him into my room
and even sleep on my bed

142
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,160
without my permission?

143
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,280
That's my personal space!

144
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,560
I thought the two of you
are getting along quite well.

145
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,880
What should I do now?

146
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:29,360
Should I get a pressure washer
to clean your room thoroughly?

147
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,960
Mom,

148
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,760
we just started dating.

149
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,600
Now he's meeting
my colleagues and parents.

150
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:39,040
He even gets to sleep on my bed
whenever he wants?

151
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,200
If I tell you I'm marrying him tomorrow,

152
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,280
will you be happy? Will you approve?

153
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,400
Fanxing.

154
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,680
Fanxing,

155
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,840
I'm sorry.

156
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,160
I'll change the bedsheets right away.

157
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,040
That won't be necessary.

158
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,680
He Fanxing.

159
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,720
The dumplings are ready.

160
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,680
It smells good!

161
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,320
Come on.

162
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,480
I'll feed you.

163
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:36,080
Come on. Have a bite, come on.

164
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,600
Is it good?

165
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,360
That's right.

166
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,440
When one is in a bad mood,
one should eat something delicious.

167
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,680
One would be happy
when one's blood sugar rises.

168
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,760
Here, take it.

169
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,840
Good girl.

170
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,560
Good girl!

171
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,200
Such a drama queen.

172
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:04,200
Were you mad at your mom or yourself?

173
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,600
For me,

174
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,480
be it love or marriage,

175
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,720
it must proceed naturally.

176
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,600
But I feel like
I'm being dragged along now.

177
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,880
My mom is treating him
like he's my husband already.

178
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,960
Ye is an aggressive kind of boyfriend.

179
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,640
He's a good catch.

180
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:32,480
That's why you two look
very compatible to everyone.

181
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:36,160
That's why we might seem pushy at times.

182
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:38,280
When you refuse to be dragged along,

183
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:41,400
you'll start resisting
with the same forcefulness.

184
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:46,280
Many are dragging you along,
so it must be really hard on you.

185
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,560
Maybe I'm the problem.

186
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,600
He's my boyfriend now.

187
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:07,840
I should focus on
my relationship with him.

188
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:14,560
But as I move forward,
I doubt myself more and more.

189
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,600
I'm not even sure
if this is right anymore.

190
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,280
I've become very sensitive
and quarrelsome.

191
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,400
Fanxing.

192
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:27,080
Don't you think you're too anxious
in this relationship?

193
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,440
All right, don't think too much about it.

194
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:37,080
Time will tell you the answer.

195
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,360
How about this? Let's visit Xiaoyu later.

196
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:44,760
The pregnancy gift pack I ordered is here.
Let's bring it to her.

197
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,840
I'll give her a call.

198
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,880
YANG XIAOYU

199
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:01,120
Hello, Xiaoyu. Are you home?

200
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,040
Song Xue and I want to visit you.

201
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,320
How romantic.

202
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,560
All right, then.

203
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:12,040
Enjoy your date with your husband.

204
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,680
See you soon.

205
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,200
Are they on a date?

206
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:23,080
She said Shen Fanfan is taking her
on a date and shopping trip.

207
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,320
He has even arranged a candlelit dinner.

208
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,000
She's giving birth soon.

209
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:30,600
Shen Fanfan is cheering her up
as much as he can.

210
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:33,440
-Cheer her up?
-That's right.

211
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,920
Shen Fanfan is treating Xiaoyu
so nice now.

212
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:42,000
I can finally be at ease!

213
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,480
Fanxing, Shen Fanfan is...

214
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,000
What about him?

215
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:00,480
He seems to be much better
compared to the past.

216
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,320
That's right!

217
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,400
It just started.

218
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,200
He's grown up.

219
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:14,080
You shouldn't have ordered
the bird's nest with papaya.

220
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,720
There's no bird's nest in it.

221
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,680
They skimped on ingredients,
but it still costs 108 yuan.

222
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:22,160
I was afraid
other things might contain additives.

223
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,720
Why don't we go home?
Forget about the movie.

224
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,800
I'm worried about Peanut.

225
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:30,200
It's all right. Mom and Dad
are at home, looking after her.

226
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,560
Look at you.
You always worry about Peanut.

227
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:37,120
You only care about her,
you don't love me anymore.

228
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:42,920
We've been married for so long
and have two kids now.

229
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,640
Love is irrelevant now.

230
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,560
So what if we're an old couple?

231
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,320
Dear,

232
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,440
even when you're old and wrinkly,

233
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:54,920
I'll still love you.

234
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,080
Why are you laughing?

235
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,440
It's nothing.

236
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,320
Who is it? Why did you hang up?

237
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,800
It's an unknown number.

238
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,640
They kept calling me lately.

239
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,160
It might be a salesman.

240
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,840
See, it's an unknown number.

241
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:25,080
What's wrong?
Why do you need to show me that?

242
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,280
You're crazy.

243
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,280
When does the movie start?

244
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,800
It starts in ten more minutes.

245
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:35,480
Dear, why don't you use
the bathroom while you can?

246
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,600
It'll be dark when the movie starts.

247
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,680
It'll be hard to move around
with the baby bump.

248
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,520
All right.

249
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,440
-I'll go now.
-Okay.

250
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,400
Let me help you. Come on.

251
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,200
-Take it slow.
-Okay.

252
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,320
Be careful, dear.

253
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,200
Hello?

254
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,040
Who are you?

255
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,480
What do you want?

256
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,680
Listen. I broke up with Kou.

257
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:14,960
It was an accident.

258
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,040
Stop harassing me, do you understand?

259
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,680
Hello?

260
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,680
Uncle, you're back.

261
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,560
What are you doing?

262
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,680
Are you all right? What did you eat?

263
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,240
I ate at a restaurant.

264
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,680
You must not have dinner yet
since you're so busy.

265
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:44,440
I got your supper. I'll heat it up.

266
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,960
Uncle, I'll go finish mopping the floor.

267
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:08,200
Stop!

268
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,480
Sit.

269
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,440
You're acting really weird.

270
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,240
Let's have a chat.

271
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:27,440
All right. Let's chat!
What should we chat about?

272
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,160
Did your boyfriend take you
to that restaurant?

273
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:37,640
Yes. He even got me
a lot of stuffed animals.

274
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:38,840
Look!

275
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:44,520
Did you really win the stuffed animals
or actually ransacked the claw machine?

276
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,800
How did you know we ransacked it?

277
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,240
I was just kidding!

278
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,600
We bought them.

279
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,000
We spent hundreds of yuan on them.

280
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:58,400
Such cheap stuffed animals.
What did you even get them for?

281
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,480
I like cheap toys.

282
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,480
Don't you like handbags,

283
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:08,200
cosmetics, and jewelry?

284
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,160
I'm not crazy!

285
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,840
My boyfriend isn't a new-rich.

286
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:14,080
Then, why did you ask me
to buy those for you?

287
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,080
I see.

288
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:18,440
So, am I a new-rich to you?

289
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,960
Uncle,

290
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,200
don't pick on me
the moment you come back, all right?

291
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:27,160
Even if he is the prince of Belgium,
you still wouldn't go easy on him.

292
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,360
That's because I'm the apple of your eye.

293
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:32,880
Stop it!

294
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,040
The holidays are coming.

295
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,360
When will you return home?
Bought your ticket yet?

296
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,560
I won't be returning home.

297
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,200
You're not?

298
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:45,720
What will you be doing then?

299
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,480
I have to look after my house.

300
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,440
Will your house be going somewhere?

301
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,760
It's not that.

302
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,040
The furniture is coming in.

303
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:57,920
Besides, Liu Zhanni
got a job at a restaurant.

304
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,880
I'm going to work there with her as well.

305
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,400
-Work?
-Yes.

306
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:06,680
Work? You?

307
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,360
Can't I work?

308
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:10,800
Sure, you can!

309
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,840
It's time you learned anyway.

310
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,760
What are the working hours?

311
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:23,920
From 11 a.m. to 9 p.m.

312
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,480
It's business hours.

313
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,240
Yes. Correct.

314
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:32,880
A full-time job? It'll be tough.

315
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,880
What restaurant is it?

316
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,640
I forgot the name.

317
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,680
It's an Italian restaurant.

318
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,080
The fancy kind.

319
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:46,280
Well then, the pay should be
around eight to nine thousand yuan, right?

320
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,440
It is.

321
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,440
That's good.

322
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:55,200
Your aunt and I can have a meal there
since you're there as well.

323
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:57,680
Sure.

324
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:08,360
There's only you and Bai
in the admin department.

325
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,720
So after some discussion,

326
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:15,680
when we move our company,
Aijia's admin department will take over.

327
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,680
You two will join their team.

328
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,280
Even though we don't have
a good offer for you,

329
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:25,400
but their admin department is simpler.

330
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,320
You won't have to deal with everything.

331
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,720
You'll only be assessing attendance.

332
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:32,800
I suppose you'll be getting married soon.

333
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,360
This is better,
you won't have to deal with much.

334
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:50,560
You said I had to take leave
to help you with something important.

335
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,960
So, is it a house viewing?

336
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:54,120
Yes!

337
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,560
To common folks like us,
buying a house is a huge thing.

338
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,800
We might be living in it
for the rest of our lives.

339
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,040
Isn't that important?

340
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,880
You work in a renovation firm.

341
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,520
You must be experienced.

342
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,080
You must know things to take note,

343
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:13,400
like housing types or residential lots.

344
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,760
You'd know more than me.

345
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:17,040
Who else can I bring if not you?

346
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,320
That makes sense.

347
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,520
But I'm very expensive.

348
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,040
Tonight's fancy dinner is on you.

349
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,440
Okay!

350
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:29,200
Those houses
are within the lake commercial area.

351
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:31,480
The lake park is at your doorstep.

352
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,720
This land is highly valuable.

353
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:34,920
It's very exclusive.

354
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,720
You'll be hard-pressed
to find anything like this.

355
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:39,920
That's why there are only
a few units left now.

356
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,960
It's on the lower ground.

357
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:48,840
It's covered in greenery too.

358
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:51,920
I'm guessing
there's less sunlight overall?

359
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,840
Please check out the layout.

360
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,760
There's a patio that would help
in brightening up your home.

361
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:01,760
And the inner units
would be quieter and far from noise.

362
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:07,800
Based on the model,
the unit is at the lowest ground level.

363
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,400
The patio...

364
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:12,840
There's a green walkway to the patio too.

365
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,400
With plants,
not much sunlight will be getting in.

366
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,520
How about the units over there
in the middle?

367
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:21,960
These?

368
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
It's all right.

369
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,240
It's fine if none are available.
We'll check out other places.

370
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,280
Well...

371
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:33,040
There's a unit there that was reserved
by someone just yesterday.

372
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:36,600
I'm not sure of the status.
Let me ask the manager.

373
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:40,200
It's okay, we might not want it.

374
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,520
Sorry, I have to answer this.

375
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:50,840
Hello?

376
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,640
Your husband is so nice.

377
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,000
He's my boyfriend.

378
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,720
I guess he'll be your husband really soon.

379
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:00,760
He's so gentle.
He must listen to you a lot.

380
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,120
I bet he's a family man.

381
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,000
It's true!

382
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:08,120
I've worked here for almost six years.
I'm a great judge of character.

383
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,800
Gentle and obedient.

384
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:16,640
Spot on!

385
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,880
How many kids will you have?

386
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,480
We just started dating.

387
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:23,800
There's no plan yet.

388
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:26,400
Hold onto him if he's this good of a man.

389
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:29,160
He's buying a house after all.
It won't be long.

390
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,200
No man would do this for nothing.

391
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:33,480
This is like a marriage proposal.

392
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,640
Have a look at the units with a garden.

393
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:40,400
You can set up swings in the yard
for the kids.

394
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:43,440
Two kids, a girl and a boy,
would be the best!

395
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:46,680
Where were we?

396
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:50,840
We were saying that when you have kids,
they can play on the swings in the garden.

397
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,640
Let's take a look at the units, shall we?

398
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,080
Of course, please follow me.

399
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:05,840
Thanks, Dad.

400
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,080
How's work?

401
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:10,720
It's fine.

402
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,800
Be nice to your colleagues.

403
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,360
You're new.

404
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:17,520
Don't be too ignorant.

405
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,040
I know.

406
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:23,400
Don't be afraid to ask questions.
Be thick-skinned.

407
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,400
Have you been eating well?

408
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:33,160
The stores around the company are nice.

409
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:35,720
Sometimes, I cook as well.

410
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:38,760
Can you cook?

411
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:42,000
Simple dishes.
I'll cook for you next time.

412
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,360
Meiyin told me you had a breakup?

413
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:53,800
Yes.

414
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,400
Who's the lady with the good handwriting?

415
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:00,880
How did you know that?

416
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:04,920
Your handmade cup has "Song Yuan"
written on it.

417
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,480
Did she write that?

418
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,280
She was just playing.

419
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,480
She said that is my English name.

420
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:17,480
What a coincidence.
That was originally your name.

421
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,680
Your mom wanted you to take her surname.

422
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,800
Neither of you has my surname.

423
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,840
This woman that you like isn't bad.

424
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,320
I heard that she's older.

425
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:30,880
That's better.

426
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:32,800
That's better.

427
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,200
I think so too.

428
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:38,880
She's different
from the other girls I know.

429
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:43,120
Independent, capable, and so kind.

430
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,920
Everyone who knows her adores her.

431
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:49,200
How did you get such a good woman?

432
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:50,960
I'm outstanding myself.

433
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:54,200
Why did you get dumped then?

434
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,440
I was not outstanding enough.

435
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,640
-Is it funny?
-More or less.

436
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:11,440
But I intend to win her back.

437
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,360
Well,

438
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:18,080
if you ever need my help, just say it.

439
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,960
How can you help?

440
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,640
As her boss, you'd order her
to get back with me?

441
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:26,320
I can definitely help.

442
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:29,240
For instance,
you can ask her out for dinner.

443
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,000
Shower her with flowers and gifts.

444
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,920
Or travel with her.

445
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:36,680
I can provide you with five years of
funding without interest. How about that?

446
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,000
Forget it.

447
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:43,160
If I buy her something,
she'd return twice the amount.

448
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,400
She'd stuff my fridge with food.

449
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,680
And even daily necessities too.

450
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:52,480
She likes Braised Meat, so she'd get
lots of canned food as well for it.

451
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,960
So, she's not materialistic.

452
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,600
Well then,

453
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,720
this is difficult.

454
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,720
I thought you'd be against this.

455
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,440
Why would I?

456
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:08,280
I thought you'd want me to take over Aijia
and marry a rich girl.

457
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:09,680
A political marriage or something.

458
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,640
Sending you to Aijia

459
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,600
to take over the business
is definitely something beneficial.

460
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,200
But marriage is completely different.

461
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,320
No matter who you marry,

462
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,080
there will be risks.

463
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:24,880
I can only give my opinions
on this matter.

464
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,800
Of course, I don't get to decide.

465
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:33,600
<i>Communication is the only way
to solve problems.</i>

466
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:34,800
<i>Go.</i>

467
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,160
Dad,

468
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,120
I know you care for me.

469
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:41,920
However, I don't like management.

470
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,560
I like to design.

471
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:47,160
Just like Mom is into plants
and you're into management.

472
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:48,920
Think about it.

473
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,840
If you had to switch jobs,

474
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:53,320
it would be torture for you two.

475
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:58,320
Do the things you like
and make a living out of it.

476
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,520
You taught us that.

477
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,880
Yes, you're right.

478
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:10,640
Well,

479
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,720
if you like to design, go ahead.

480
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,200
You have my support.

481
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,800
I'm still young anyway.

482
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:23,440
You're taking over two years from now
is not a big deal.

483
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,680
You've got a deal here.

484
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:28,880
<i>Hey! How is that a deal?</i>

485
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,600
<i>I didn't agree to anything!
You're so stubborn!</i>

486
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,920
Mr. Ye, you've viewed the house.

487
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,960
This residential type
is our best property.

488
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,560
Only a dozen units have the best view.

489
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:48,240
Your house needs a down payment
of 50 percent.

490
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:50,880
After tax...

491
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,280
This will be the price.

492
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,080
When will I get the house?

493
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,720
It's a pre-made house.

494
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:04,280
It's in the final stages
and will be ready in September.

495
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:07,120
If you buy it now, you can already hire
a renovation company to work with.

496
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,400
We have three renovation partners.

497
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:12,560
They're offering great renovation packages
for owners.

498
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,800
There's no need for that.
My girlfriend is in this field.

499
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,000
Which company is it?

500
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:20,200
Amazing Decoration.

501
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:23,640
Amazing Decoration?
Amazing Decoration is one of our partners!

502
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,080
Are you a designer?

503
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:28,080
I'm in administration.

504
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:31,920
I know Zeng from your company very well.

505
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,400
Is her baby due soon?

506
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:35,760
In a few more months.

507
00:29:58,520 --> 00:29:59,600
He Fanxing,

508
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:03,360
you look like a mushroom
that just sprouted on the couch.

509
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,800
You just viewed houses
with your boyfriend.

510
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:09,640
Do you have any idea
how expensive they are?

511
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:13,520
Moreover, he didn't say he would
put your name on the property license.

512
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,320
So why are you so nervous?

513
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:16,800
But then again,

514
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:20,600
if he's willing to put my name on it,
even I would marry him.

515
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,280
What?

516
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:29,800
He Canyang, I might need to live off you.

517
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,200
What?

518
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:35,120
If I resign, I'll live off you.

519
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:39,840
Are you thinking of resigning?

520
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,040
Are they firing you?

521
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:46,600
I just want to quit.

522
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:53,840
No.

523
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:57,560
I just feel like
the world outside this blanket

524
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:00,200
seems so strange.

525
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:02,760
Aren't you hot?

526
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:05,160
I can take it!

527
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:08,240
Come on, Fanxing. It's July!

528
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,280
-He Canyang!
-Are you covering up rashes?

529
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:13,160
Give me back my blanket!

530
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:18,560
I'm sorry!

531
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:22,480
I'm sorry! Please let me go!
I'll give it back!

532
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,880
Why are you still working?

533
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:57,440
I have nothing to do anyway.

534
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,600
Why are you even here? It's so late.

535
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:02,360
I was meeting a client,
so I decided to drop by.

536
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:04,800
When is the surgery?

537
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,720
Tomorrow afternoon.

538
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:09,480
Have you started fasting?

539
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:13,560
I thought I'd peel you an apple.

540
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,480
It's all right.

541
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,720
It's just a minor surgery.

542
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:19,320
I'll be good as new
after two days on IV drips.

543
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:22,440
Who's that?

544
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:23,880
My mom.

545
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:26,840
Is she your friend?

546
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:29,760
Mom, this is my colleague, Cong Xiao.

547
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:30,720
This is my mom.

548
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:32,760
Hello, ma'am. I'm Cong Xiao.

549
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:37,760
"She smiles among flowers."
That's a good name.

550
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,080
You're so pretty too.

551
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,280
So are you.

552
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:44,200
I'm old, I'm not pretty anymore.

553
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,160
Here, have a yogurt.

554
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:49,800
It's just something simple.

555
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:52,480
Thank you, ma'am. I love drinking yogurt.

556
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:56,560
Son, you two carry on.
I'll go watch TV next door.

557
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,120
-Okay, Mom.
-See you, ma'am.

558
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,560
Your mom is very friendly.

559
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:07,880
Of course.

560
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:18,800
Mission accomplished.

561
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:22,920
What happened?

562
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,400
Are you all slacking off?

563
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:31,440
What?

564
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:36,920
Which stage are you and Mr. Ye at now?

565
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:39,000
Hurry up and tell us the truth.

566
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,200
Speak the truth.

567
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:42,120
We might go easy on you.

568
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,360
What about it? What are you talking about?

569
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,080
Congratulations!

570
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:49,040
I think the whole company already knows.

571
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,400
You're getting married!

572
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,880
Getting married? With who?

573
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:56,600
Who applied for leave yesterday afternoon
to view houses with Mr. Ye?

574
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:58,680
Zeng told us.

575
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:02,320
There was a property consultant
who was working on your purchase.

576
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:06,280
The consultant.

577
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,679
You wouldn't even take a day off
when you're sick.

578
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,880
Yet, you took a day off
to go house viewing.

579
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:14,880
Are you pregnant?

580
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:18,159
Really? Congratulations! You're a mother!

581
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:19,960
That's nonsense.

582
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:23,840
I'm neither pregnant nor getting married.
Nothing is going on!

583
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:25,520
Then why did you go house viewing?

584
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,480
He wanted to buy a house.

585
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:30,320
I just accompanied him
and gave suggestions.

586
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:33,679
He's buying a house.
It has nothing to do with me.

587
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:36,080
That's a disappointment.

588
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:39,120
I told you, it wouldn't be so fast.

589
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,760
No, it sure has something to do with you.

590
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:44,880
When a man takes his girlfriend
to view houses,

591
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,400
it's an obvious hint.

592
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:52,159
"I want you to be a part of
my present and future!"

593
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,760
Nonsense. He doesn't think like that.

594
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,480
No way.

595
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:03,680
If I think like that,
Mr. Ye must be the same!

596
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:07,640
Mr. Ye is really caring.
He makes me feel so secure!

597
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,320
If you propose
to put your name on the house,

598
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,280
Mr. Ye would say yes for sure!

599
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,160
That's after they're married!

600
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,440
Only then would it be a joint property.

601
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:19,840
Both of you will be secured then.

602
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:22,800
Cut it out.

603
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,920
That house costs millions of yuan.

604
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,160
Are you crazy?

605
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,120
Bai is right.

606
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:30,960
You're honest and not cunning at all.

607
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:34,120
If he can keep you with a house,
that's a great deal!

608
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:36,880
You guys carry on without me.

609
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,040
She's shy.

610
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,360
That's right!

611
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,280
They'll get married soon for sure!

612
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,640
That's right.

613
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:05,960
I heard that

614
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:07,640
you're pregnant.

615
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:20,240
CHARCOAL FIRE ROAST MEAT
XIANG ZHANG GARDEN

616
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:37,360
Delicious. It's nice to be served
by a superior.

617
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:41,840
What's wrong?

618
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:44,920
You're the one who said you'll make it up
to me and I can order anything.

619
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:48,200
It was all because of that nonsense!
Can't you tell it was a baseless rumor?

620
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:49,440
No.

621
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:51,440
I thought the baby was mine.

622
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:54,040
Are you trying to get beaten up?

623
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:55,360
I'm just kidding.

624
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:57,880
That's not funny.

625
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,320
Okay, I was wrong. Go on.

626
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,240
Do it yourself!

627
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,360
You're so fierce, no man will marry you.

628
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:12,720
Yuan Song, that line was used

629
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:15,720
to threaten women of the older generation.

630
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:20,360
Women nowadays don't see marriage
as their life's objective. Okay?

631
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,880
So you do know how good I am, right?

632
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:25,280
That old fox only wants to tie you up.

633
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:28,080
You two just got together,
but have already gone house viewing.

634
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,920
He's clearly forcing you.

635
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,560
Says who?

636
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,520
You just won't shut up.

637
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,440
Talk to him like this if you dare.

638
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:40,600
The problem is I can't even be mad at him.

639
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:44,360
He just wanted me to help him view houses.

640
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,160
You really shouldn't get
into a relationship.

641
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,440
You even need a reason to be mad at him.

642
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:51,520
You're too sensible. You look smart,
but you're actually a fool.

643
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:53,880
Where's your wisdom?

644
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:55,360
There's nothing in your brain

645
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,080
or in your looks!

646
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:00,080
You're just like a fresh college graduate.

647
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:05,000
Eat more!

648
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:06,800
You're skin and bones.

649
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:10,640
You've become so rude to me!

650
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,360
You weren't like this before.

651
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:13,760
You were much better.

652
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:16,840
If you demand respect,
then be respectable.

653
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,280
You're not any better.

654
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:25,560
By the way,
I'll be having dinner at your home.

655
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:28,920
For what?

656
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:30,240
I'm picking up Braised Meat.

657
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:32,080
Why are you staying for dinner then?

658
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:37,400
When I called Professor He,
your mom was there.

659
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:40,360
She found out I'm going there,
so she asked me to come for dinner.

660
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:44,560
Then don't eat this.

661
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,400
You'll be eating tonight, stop eating.

662
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:48,880
I'm hungry!

663
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,720
Then eat it now and not tonight.

664
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,240
You can't stop me!

665
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,480
You just don't get fat.

666
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,920
I just don't, do you envy me?

667
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,080
I've sent the sponsor to his car.

668
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,040
Let's go, Luming.

669
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:33,680
All right.

670
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:45,560
SUCHENG DINER

671
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,280
Ma'am!

672
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:55,440
Sorry, I was caught in traffic.

673
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:57,200
How long has he been there?

674
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:58,680
He just went in.

675
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:00,760
Why are you here? What about work?

676
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:03,400
It's fine, my leave has been approved.

677
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:06,280
You're alone here, I was worried.

678
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:09,480
Thank you so much.

679
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:11,320
It's all right.

680
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,520
Chang Huan was a naughty kid.

681
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:17,200
He loved playing video games
and frequented cybercafes.

682
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,600
If he went there, he wouldn't come home.

683
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:23,800
Whenever the teacher went there
to look for students, he'd be there.

684
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:27,640
It's been hard on us.
His dad and I were teachers.

685
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:31,880
We'd play rock-paper-scissors
and the winner would pick him up.

686
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:34,200
Shouldn't the loser pick him up?

687
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:36,200
The loser would be the one in a bad mood.

688
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:39,080
You'd have to face your colleagues
when you pick him up.

689
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,360
So, the winner shall happily go instead.

690
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,600
How did he get into university?

691
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:49,640
When Chang Huan was in Grade 11,
his dad was very ill.

692
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:52,880
The hospital issued
a critical illness notice.

693
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:56,920
His dad called him up
and gave him his last words.

694
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:01,600
He told Chang Huan that if he passed,
he has to take care of me.

695
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:03,360
What happened after that?

696
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,840
His dad was lucky, he recovered.

697
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:10,520
He seemed to have been enlightened
since then.

698
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:12,800
He stopped gaming and studied hard.

699
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:14,960
But his grasp of the basics was terrible.

700
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:17,480
So he learned drawing
and studied art instead.

701
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:22,280
So, Chang Huan is a person
who needs to be enlightened.

702
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:25,160
That's right. He's working so hard now.

703
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:27,360
Perhaps he was enlightened again.

704
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,600
Both his dad and I have our pensions.

705
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:34,280
We live in a small town.
The expenses are low.

706
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:35,800
We don't spend a lot.

707
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,120
We can even support him.

708
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,120
He has even bought a house.

709
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:44,080
But he still plans to buy a bigger house
with a view of a river.

710
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:49,200
So, we thought
he might have fallen for a girl

711
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:52,160
who thinks he's lazy and unambitious.

712
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:01,400
