1
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,960
There was once a stubborn donkey

2
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,680
which only headed south.

3
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,360
In the south, there was a wall.

4
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:11,280
The donkey hit it and died.

5
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,680
Is this what happened to you
in your past life?

6
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,360
My relationship has been exposed.

7
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,560
They are angry at me.

8
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,240
Don't add fuel to the fire.

9
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,480
Dad and Mom like Ye Luming a lot.

10
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,360
Can't you tell them some other time?

11
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,840
Do you know how to kill a whale?

12
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,280
What? A whale? Just use a gun.

13
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,520
A speargun.

14
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,840
No, electrocute it.

15
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:45,720
Why?

16
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,360
You just have to keep throwing plastic
into the sea.

17
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,640
It will consume the plastic

18
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,760
just like how it consumes food.

19
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,840
As time passes,

20
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:00,760
slowly,

21
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,600
its stomach will be
full of undigested plastic.

22
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,880
Then it will gradually die.

23
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,680
Do you have a fever?

24
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,480
Canyang.

25
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,760
I've kept the truth from them
for too long.

26
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,240
To me,

27
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,120
lying is like a whale consuming plastic.

28
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,480
It's a slow suicide.

29
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,640
It doesn't matter
if I'm lying to myself or others.

30
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,760
The pain will only get stronger.

31
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,320
But you can't tell them now. Dad is ill.

32
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,360
But it's the best time to tell Dad now.

33
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,520
-Look--
-The tomatoes are great today.

34
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,800
They must be organic.

35
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,000
Fanxing, you're awake.

36
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,200
Hey.

37
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,800
Isn't that our neighbor?

38
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,160
-Why is he in our house?
-That's enough.

39
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,480
Fanxing.

40
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,000
There's porridge. Go and eat some.

41
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,680
We'll have roasted fish tonight.

42
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,200
Dad, Mom.

43
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,280
I have something to tell you.

44
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,600
In the end, you still broke up?

45
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,000
We noticed something was off.

46
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,480
I just thought

47
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,400
that since you've never liked
anyone before,

48
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,680
both of you should get together first

49
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,360
as Luming is handsome and nice.

50
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,400
As time passes, feelings would develop.

51
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,320
Like your dad and me.

52
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,280
We met because of a friend.

53
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:00,800
Back then, I chose him
because he was nice.

54
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,960
Enough with our story.

55
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,120
That was during our generation.

56
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,080
Just let them be.

57
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,440
They are not destined to be together.

58
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,760
If you do meet someone you like...

59
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,080
I already have.

60
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:15,840
He Fanxing.

61
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,920
The person I like is--

62
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,840
He Fanxing, don't go too far!

63
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,120
You have already broken up.

64
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:35,720
Dad, Mom.

65
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,520
I'm sorry I kept this from you.

66
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,880
Actually,

67
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,880
I was with Yuan Song before.

68
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,440
Are you crazy?

69
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,280
-Canyang!
-How could you tell them?

70
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,720
Can't you take it slow?

71
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,040
You're so selfish.

72
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,800
Canyang, let go!

73
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,520
-Let go!
-Let go!

74
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,440
I'm sorry, He Canyang.

75
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,520
I didn't mean to anger them.

76
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,440
I just can't forget Yuan Song.

77
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,560
Canyang! Can't you talk nicely?

78
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,760
Do you have to hit her?

79
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,040
He Canyang!

80
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,520
What are you doing?

81
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,560
You hit her before she said anything!

82
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,720
Who taught you that?

83
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,560
Are you trying to make me mad?

84
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,880
You're just biased.

85
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,640
Yuan Song is so much younger than her.

86
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,120
What did Mrs. Wang call Fang Shanshan?

87
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,120
She called her...

88
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,400
-shameless.
-Shut up!

89
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,680
What about Fang Shanshan?

90
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,160
What about your sister?

91
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,480
What about being shameless?

92
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,400
If you think that she's shameless,

93
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,760
what about you and Cai Minmin?

94
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:33,800
I'm a man!

95
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:36,200
It's fine for me to get a younger partner.
No one will say a thing!

96
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,680
But she's a woman! How is it the same?

97
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,440
So what if she's a woman?

98
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,680
What's so different?

99
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,120
Tell me!

100
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,080
Is the law against it?

101
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,040
Fine.

102
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,320
Are you saying it's okay for her
to be with Yuan Song?

103
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,560
Why not?

104
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,640
Both of them are single.

105
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,080
It's not adultery.

106
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,800
Do you want to know
what being shameless is?

107
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,120
Look at Shen Fanfan!

108
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,640
Fine.

109
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,200
I wish for He Fanxing and Yuan Song
to be together again.

110
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,840
Anyhow, you're just being biased.

111
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,880
Get out of here!

112
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,880
Don't come to our house again!

113
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,560
You...

114
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,520
This boy, Canyang...

115
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:19,920
Hey.

116
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,960
Why are you laughing?

117
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,040
Didn't you hear what he said?

118
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,760
If Fanxing gets back with Yuan Song,

119
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,600
will you be fine with it?

120
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,360
Dad, Mom.

121
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,360
I'm sorry.

122
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,320
Come, sit here.

123
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,000
Tell us.

124
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,760
What's going on?

125
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,840
Before Ye Luming,

126
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:09,600
I actually dated Yuan Song for a while.

127
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,240
He was my first boyfriend.

128
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:15,920
My first love.

129
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,960
But I had too many concerns about us.

130
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,760
So I kept it a secret,

131
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,880
in case you would be embarrassed.

132
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,200
Then we broke up.

133
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,920
So I thought
there wasn't a need to say it.

134
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,080
If you still like Yuan Song,

135
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,960
why did you date Luming?

136
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,920
Aren't you playing with his feelings?

137
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,280
His sister even came to our house.

138
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:56,400
Anyone would have thought that
you two were getting along well

139
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,320
and planning to get married.

140
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,080
I wanted to.

141
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,280
After Dad fell sick,

142
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,320
I really wanted to get married.

143
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,000
So that Dad would be at ease.

144
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,360
I tried my best.

145
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,120
Every day, I felt

146
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,240
so exhausted inside.

147
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,160
I hate myself for not being able
to compromise

148
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,160
like everyone else.

149
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:51,080
But why can't I just
be different from others?

150
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,200
Why can't I be different?

151
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,560
Fanxing.

152
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,920
Being different

153
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,320
is exhausting.

154
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:08,680
Haven't you always wanted a simple life?

155
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,680
That's right.

156
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,320
But no matter what we choose,

157
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:24,000
life is never simple.

158
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,760
We have to bear the consequences

159
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,960
of our own choices.

160
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,040
Since you have thought it through,

161
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,280
then I

162
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,640
will say no more.

163
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,160
I'm tired.

164
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,680
I'm going to get some rest.

165
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,120
How do you want the yellow corvina cooked?

166
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,160
What?

167
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,000
Didn't you say that I was biased?

168
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,600
I bought your favorite yellow corvina.

169
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,520
Do you want it grilled or steamed?

170
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:39,800
Grilled.

171
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,240
Mom, is Dad--

172
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,400
Thank you, Mom.

173
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,120
<i>The door is opened.</i>

174
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,840
<i>You hung up on me!</i>

175
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,120
That's why I'm calling you now.

176
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:14,520
<i>Were you never going to call me
if I never called you?</i>

177
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,240
Why would I not?

178
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,000
<i>But you're doing it right now!</i>

179
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,240
<i>This is too much!</i>

180
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,760
<i>I will never forgive you!</i>

181
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,320
Okay, I'm sorry.

182
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:23,920
Where are you right now?

183
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:24,840
I'll make it up to you.

184
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,880
<i>I'm outside your house!</i>

185
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,320
Why are you smiling?

186
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,520
Are you here to dump me?

187
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,640
What?

188
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,680
No.

189
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,440
I thought you'd never forgive me.

190
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,840
I said it out of anger.

191
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,240
It's not that I'll never forgive you.

192
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,320
You have to apologize. That will do.

193
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,520
I'm sorry.

194
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:04,960
Is...

195
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,680
Is that all?

196
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,280
Isn't saying "sorry" an apology?

197
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,200
Or do you want me to ask for a flogging?

198
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,200
No.

199
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,520
Did you stand long? Are you tired?

200
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:21,120
No, I just arrived.

201
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,440
About an hour ago.

202
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,160
Want to go get a drink?

203
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:30,960
Yes.

204
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,240
How is your uncle?

205
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,520
He already left for work when I woke up.

206
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,080
I asked my aunt.

207
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:46,280
She said that he isn't showing
any signs of a breakup.

208
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:49,080
He still talks cheerfully to his clients.

209
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,360
I'm starting to doubt

210
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:55,800
if he ever truly loved Fanxing.

211
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,680
You're indeed a kid.

212
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:05,240
He is way past the age
to give up on life over a breakup.

213
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,120
Life goes on.

214
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,800
His employees are depending on him
to feed their families.

215
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:14,120
Clients' orders still have
to be completed in time.

216
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,360
With so many responsibilities,
how can he mope around?

217
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,640
Even if he's sad,

218
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,640
he can only endure and bear it himself.

219
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,400
My uncle is so pitiful.

220
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,880
I must listen to him
and never make him angry.

221
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,960
What if he asks you to break up with me?

222
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:39,800
No way!

223
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,280
By the way, how is Fanxing?

224
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,080
Fanxing?

225
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:56,120
She has finally set herself free.

226
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,120
Tell me.

227
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,280
Remember your ID.

228
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,040
Don't forget your things
and take care of Luo.

229
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,160
Should I call you Mom now?

230
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,080
You're such a nag.

231
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,440
I'm fine with that.

232
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,360
Both of you are so close.

233
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,400
You look more like his sister
than his mom.

234
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,640
You're such a sweet-talker.

235
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,480
Beware.

236
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,400
He might go crazy for you.

237
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,960
Meiyin, you must be joking.

238
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,720
Luo Wenyue is just teasing me.

239
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:36,600
Come on.

240
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,000
You're the boss' son.

241
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,360
I would never tease you.

242
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,800
Perhaps I actually like you for real.

243
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,240
No, give me a break.

244
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:49,680
Ms. Wu, look at how heartless he is.

245
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:55,040
It's been so long
since you looked this happy.

246
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,720
Good things are coming.

247
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:58,600
Hey.

248
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:02,760
Are you happy because
we're going to Suzhou together?

249
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:04,880
Of course not.

250
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,760
You're really heartless!

251
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:08,800
I'm done.

252
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,240
Take care of each other

253
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,960
when you get there.

254
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:17,160
Perhaps, things will change
when you're back.

255
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,360
WENHANG

256
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,360
Excuse me, it's a friend.

257
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:33,520
Tell me honestly.
What do you think of Yuan Song?

258
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,000
He's cute and wild.

259
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,200
I like it.

260
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:42,760
But he still seems to be hung up on

261
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:45,920
the former executive director
of Amazing Decoration.

262
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:47,960
Did he tell you that?

263
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:51,680
I noticed it the other day
when we went bowling.

264
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:56,600
The ambiguous feeling between them

265
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,800
was too obvious.

266
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,960
We all need time to recover
after a breakup.

267
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,520
It's perfectly normal.

268
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,840
But it is interesting.

269
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,960
I like a good challenge.

270
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:13,880
You're young indeed.

271
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:20,480
You two, say something.

272
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,360
Was I too aggressive?

273
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:26,640
<i>Should I slow down?</i>

274
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,000
<i>My parents didn't say much.</i>

275
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:31,520
But I could tell that
they weren't happy about it.

276
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,640
YANG XIAOYU

277
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,280
<i>You're great.</i>

278
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:44,080
<i>If Malty wasn't asleep,
I would have set off firecrackers.</i>

279
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,200
What a warrior.

280
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:50,600
Among the three of us,
you're the most amazing.

281
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,840
You only look like a goody-two-shoes.

282
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,840
You're actually rebellious inside!

283
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,720
Not bad, He Fanxing.

284
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,360
Taking this difficult step
means that you're really brave.

285
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,360
When it comes to ideals or reality,

286
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,280
many would only weigh it out.

287
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,200
You're much better.

288
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,240
Hey, I understand Fanxing.

289
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:10,760
We can't just settle.

290
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:13,400
We only live once.

291
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:16,640
We should take a leap of faith
because you never know what awaits you.

292
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,560
Yang Xiaoyu.

293
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,440
You were so different two months ago.

294
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:24,040
When we're too used to a lifestyle,

295
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,920
it is hard to change.

296
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:27,640
And you.

297
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,480
Tell Tiantian's dad the truth soon.

298
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:33,720
<i>Even a condom couldn't stop his genes
from spreading.</i>

299
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,080
<i>How remarkable.</i>

300
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,280
<i>Why are you bringing this up now?</i>

301
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:40,720
<i>Hey.</i>

302
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,920
<i>Let's dance to the music of life together.</i>

303
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,480
<i>Why can't I bring it up?</i>

304
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,600
I...

305
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,680
thought you would scold me

306
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,240
for being so insensible.

307
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:53,920
<i>You are insensible.</i>

308
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:57,600
<i>But you know, it really depends.</i>

309
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,960
If it were to be my family,

310
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,200
with the way my mom is,

311
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,080
she would get a stroke.

312
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,760
As for your family...

313
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,720
Do you think that
they're ordinary parents?

314
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,680
They have solid blood vessels,
so they'll be fine soon.

315
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:12,920
Yes.

316
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,200
Hey, what about Yuan Song?

317
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,960
<i>Wasn't there a girl</i>

318
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,840
<i>who was getting quite close to him?</i>

319
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,960
I haven't given a thought about her.

320
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,600
He couldn't have changed so fast.

321
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:28,800
<i>Madam,</i>

322
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,840
<i>even the high-speed rail travels
at 380km per hour,</i>

323
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,840
<i>let alone the speed of love.</i>

324
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,040
<i>Hey.</i>

325
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,480
<i>Did you forget how you and Yuan Song</i>

326
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,600
<i>progressed at the speed of light?</i>

327
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:43,880
<i>Why does everything that comes
from your mouth sound so dirty?</i>

328
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:48,240
Besides being known as the Hegemon King,

329
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,720
I'm also known as the Contaminator.

330
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,400
Hello?

331
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:05,040
<i>Hi, our company provides
personal microfinance</i>

332
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,400
<i>and unsecured loan services.</i>

333
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:07,480
I have no money!

334
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,200
RECENT CALLS

335
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:18,800
YUAN SONG

336
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,440
Stop it, Baylor.

337
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,280
Quiet, Baylor! Don't move!

338
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,040
Hello?

339
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,400
Hello.

340
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,440
<i>Did something happen
for you to call me this late?</i>

341
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:13,800
I'm busy right now.

342
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,080
I'm currently checking in.

343
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,040
Checking in?

344
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,280
-Are you outstation?
-Yes.

345
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,720
I'm in Suzhou for a talk
by my favorite architect.

346
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,680
I see.

347
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,360
Is there anything else?

348
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,320
It's inconvenient to talk right now.

349
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,760
Yes, there is.

350
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,200
Well...

351
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,240
I just realized

352
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:37,680
that I had a five-hour call
with you last night.

353
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,800
<i>Even my battery ran out.</i>

354
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,120
What did I talk to you about?

355
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,400
It was nothing.

356
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,880
We were just chatting.

357
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,120
Why did it take five hours then?

358
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,480
Did I say a lot?

359
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:56,240
Yes. A lot of drunk talk.

360
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,320
People say that alcohol is a truth serum.

361
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,960
So I suppose it's true.

362
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,640
What?

363
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,360
I'm sorry.

364
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,640
I must have drunk too much.

365
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,560
I didn't

366
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:12,240
say anything weird, right?

367
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:15,960
You did.

368
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,640
<i>But let's talk once I'm back.</i>

369
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,600
Luo Wenyue is next to me.

370
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,320
There are things I can't say.

371
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:23,560
Luo Wenyue?

372
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:26,040
You're with Luo Wenyue?

373
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,160
You...

374
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,720
Is it just the two of you?

375
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:31,560
Yes. She likes this architect too.

376
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:32,840
Also,

377
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:34,960
we can bond on a trip, right?

378
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,000
<i>She's a good catch overall.</i>

379
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,680
<i>After some bonding,</i>

380
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,880
<i>maybe there will be romance between us.</i>

381
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,120
Bonding?

382
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,880
Such a thing doesn't need bonding.

383
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,120
Don't force yourself.

384
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,440
<i>I'm not.</i>

385
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:50,480
Don't worry.
I won't force myself because of you.

386
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,440
<i>I have to go. Bye.</i>

387
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:53,560
Hey!

388
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:07,120
Baylor, let's go home. Come on!

389
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,400
Let's go!

390
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,520
Sir, your ID and wristbands.

391
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:11,680
Thank you.

392
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:13,960
It's done, let's go.

393
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,560
Which woman were you on the phone with?

394
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:17,960
You looked so happy.

395
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,120
Yes, it was a woman.

396
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,760
Any good news?

397
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:25,560
My ex-girlfriend broke up
with her boyfriend.

398
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,000
Finally.

399
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:30,520
I don't want my ex to be happier than me.

400
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:35,680
To Suzhou?

401
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,880
Yangcheng Lake?

402
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,040
To catch crabs?

403
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,040
What crabs?

404
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,920
I'm just going on a trip for a few days.

405
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,600
Why so sudden? Who are you going with?

406
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,040
Dad, Mom.

407
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:54,520
Actually,

408
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,560
Yuan Song is in Suzhou.

409
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,920
With a female colleague.

410
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,120
I'm afraid he will fall for her,

411
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:03,080
so I'm going there to get him back.

412
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,280
I know that I'm selfish.

413
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:11,440
So please try your best to forgive me.

414
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:20,520
Mom.

415
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,240
Seriously?

416
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,960
Are you kicking Fanxing out?

417
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,520
Hey, He Canyang.

418
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,560
Great timing. Please do me a favor.

419
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:29,960
What?

420
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,720
Hello, Professor He.

421
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,960
What are you doing?
How about a drink tonight?

422
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:55,760
I can't, I'm in Suzhou.

423
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,920
<i>Suzhou? What for?</i>

424
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,360
My favorite architect
is giving a talk here.

425
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,440
I'll be attending.

426
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,200
You sound like you just woke up.

427
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,240
I'm catching up on lost sleep
from last night.

428
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:08,560
I don't believe you.

429
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:10,960
You're definitely lying
to avoid meeting me.

430
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,160
Why would I lie?

431
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:14,960
I'm around Yangcheng Lake.

432
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,400
Send me your location.

433
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,560
Where is the trust?

434
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,720
SEND LOCATION

435
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:25,800
PROFESSOR HE

436
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:27,200
Done.

437
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,160
<i>Do you trust me now?</i>

438
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,440
Yes. Rest well then.

439
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:38,960
-See you.
-<i>Bye.</i>

440
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:39,880
Bye.

441
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:30,920
Are you not resting?

442
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:32,800
This is a fine hot spring hotel.

443
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,920
I can't waste my time sleeping.

444
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,240
I have to get up early,

445
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:39,120
soak in the hot spring and go to the spa.

446
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:43,440
You don't seem happy.

447
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,280
You look like an upset high schooler

448
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:48,480
in a Japanese romance anime.

449
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,080
A poem just came to mind.

450
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,480
A poem?

451
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,040
"For years, I'll be gone.
Brilliant days shall be in vain.

452
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:00,760
Even if I feel endless passion,
to whom should I tell?"

453
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,920
"To whom should I tell?"

454
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,520
Tell me.

455
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,680
You can just fall for me.

456
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,320
That's difficult. You're not my type.

457
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:17,840
But on the day we went bowling,

458
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,720
that was not what I felt.

459
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:22,960
You just happened to be nearby.

460
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,680
Let's grab a bite in a bit.

461
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:29,440
Then we can take photos
of the architecture in a nearby town.

462
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,440
Let's meet in the lobby in half an hour.

463
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:38,840
Hello, Canyang.

464
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,080
<i>I got it.</i>

465
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:44,520
Then send me the location of the hotel.

466
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:45,560
<i>All right.</i>

467
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,240
Hey, did you book the hotel for me?

468
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:49,360
I'll do it in a bit.

469
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,480
<i>Okay, I'll rest assured then.</i>

470
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:54,520
Thank you, Canyang.

471
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:57,360
What are you thanking me for?

472
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,440
If you look back and regret,
don't blame me.

473
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,320
What did Mom and Dad say?

474
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,880
Nothing, but they didn't seem too happy.

475
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,240
<i>Don't worry, just take it as a trip.</i>

476
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:14,640
I'll take care of home.

477
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,600
That's all, bye.

478
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:18,440
Bye.

479
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:34,960
Why are you sighing?

480
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,240
I still think...

481
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:41,800
that it's not right.

482
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,480
That's right.

483
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:50,000
It's not.

484
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,560
You're right.

485
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,080
<i>Your mom and I</i>

486
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,240
<i>still think that it's not right.</i>

487
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:21,280
<i>But what other people think
doesn't matter.</i>

488
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,120
<i>As long as it feels right for you.</i>

489
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:28,280
<i>Just remember not to break the law
or hurt others,</i>

490
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:30,160
<i>and love yourself.</i>

491
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:33,120
<i>You will always be the daughter
we're proud of.</i>

492
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,560
<i>All the best!</i>

493
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:43,960
<i>I feel like</i>

494
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:47,360
<i>I'm about to fly.</i>

495
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,920
<i>Embarking on a new journey</i>

496
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,480
<i>and meeting new people.</i>

497
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:02,000
<i>A new stop is also a new beginning.</i>

498
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:47,360
YUAN SONG

499
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,360
<i>Who's the girl?</i>

500
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:49,520
<i>Haha.</i>

501
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:50,520
<i>Haha.</i>

502
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,680
<i>Bring me back some mango ice cream.</i>

503
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:19,720
He Fanxing?

504
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,240
Hi, what a coincidence.

505
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,280
<i>That was lame.</i>

506
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:27,960
Why are you here?

507
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,280
I'm traveling.

508
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:31,680
Are you traveling too?

509
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,680
<i>Are you an idiot, He Fanxing?</i>

510
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:34,920
All by yourself?

511
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,600
Yes, all by myself.

512
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:40,040
You would be scared
if only half of me was here.

513
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:41,920
<i>What a lame joke.</i>

514
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,160
What a coincidence.

515
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:47,920
Yes, that hot spring hotel
is popular on the Internet.

516
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:48,960
It's highly recommended.

517
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,480
I see.

518
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,880
You know we're staying there?

519
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,880
Are you also staying there?

520
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:00,040
What a coincidence. I just guessed.

521
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:01,960
Should we...

522
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,440
go back together?

523
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:06,240
It's okay. I want to take more photos.

524
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,880
You can head back first. Don't mind me.

525
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:12,120
Then let's go, Yuan Song.

526
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:40,120
On my way here, I had been thinking.

527
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:42,320
Was I too impulsive?

528
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:44,040
Should I take a step back?

529
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:49,080
But my body was faster than my mind.

530
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:52,240
<i>What a go-getter.</i>

531
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,360
<i>But you did the right thing.</i>

532
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:58,720
<i>I think this girl is planning
to make him hers</i>

533
00:32:58,840 --> 00:32:59,720
<i>during this trip.</i>

534
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:04,080
After all, traveling helps one to relax.

535
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,440
His guards are down right now.

536
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,880
<i>It's a good thing you went there.</i>

537
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:12,640
But he didn't have much reaction
when he saw me.

538
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,800
Did you tell him

539
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:17,040
about your breakup with Ye?

540
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,160
Not yet.

541
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,720
<i>Madam, if you didn't tell him,</i>

542
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,640
<i>what could you expect from him?</i>

543
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:30,000
Do you think I'm too madly confident?

544
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:33,280
Maybe he doesn't like me anymore.

545
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:38,200
<i>If he doesn't like you anymore,</i>

546
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,520
<i>what will you do?</i>

547
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,240
Then...

548
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,640
Then I'll try to get him back.

549
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:48,160
<i>It's because I like him.</i>

550
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:54,200
Okay. Let's talk once you're back.

551
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,200
By the way,

552
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:59,960
Professor Song and I
have decided to confess.

553
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:02,440
<i>So fast?</i>

554
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:04,840
We've talked it through.

555
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:07,240
We need to learn from you.

556
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,280
Finish it off quickly.

557
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,720
<i>I'll be back in a few days.</i>

558
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,160
Don't worry.

559
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:18,200
We will handle our own matters.

560
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:19,320
Yes.

561
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,160
Coming!

562
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:24,680
I have to go.

563
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:26,440
<i>Bye.</i>

564
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:33,480
Hi, this dessert is on the house.
Please enjoy.

565
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:36,280
Thank you.

566
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,280
It's you?

567
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:12,400
Who else? He Fanxing?

568
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:15,480
You have to keep your shirt on.

569
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:17,720
What are you talking about?

570
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,080
Isn't it obvious?

571
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:23,400
She rushed here once she heard
that we are in Suzhou.

572
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:26,120
I'm curious as to how special she is.

573
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:27,640
Yes, she's pretty.

574
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,240
But she's already 30 years old.

575
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,160
She keeps acting tough.

576
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,440
But I guess she's better now.

577
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,920
If you're here for a drink,
I'm not in the mood.

578
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:39,680
If you're here to bad-mouth my ex,

579
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:41,280
I'm going to bed.

580
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:45,800
You're finally telling the truth.

581
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:49,120
I bet you have noticed
given how smart you are.

582
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:50,920
All right.

583
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,600
Don't be mad. Come and sit.

584
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:57,000
I'm here to help.

585
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:58,320
Come here.

586
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,000
You have to keep your shirt on.

587
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:12,560
Why do you think she followed you here?

588
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,840
To get back together with me, of course.

589
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:19,280
When it comes to relationships,

590
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,240
even if there are no feelings,

591
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:23,680
no one would give in to a competitor.

592
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:24,960
Maybe...

593
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,120
she's just jealous.

594
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:30,480
Do not overrate humanity.

595
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:32,280
If you're too nice,

596
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:35,240
you will be at her beck and call.

597
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:37,720
I know.

598
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:40,800
So why do you think
I'm here drinking with you

599
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:43,480
instead of knocking at her door?

600
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:50,960
So you're not an innocent little rabbit.

601
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,840
-Do you have a plan?
-Of course.

602
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:57,200
I am not that easy to get.

603
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:58,520
I'll help you.

604
00:36:58,920 --> 00:36:59,880
There's no need.

605
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:01,840
Come on.

606
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:04,200
I'm very useful.

607
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,480
Think about it.

608
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:08,240
If she learns that
I am in this room with you,

609
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:09,920
she will be furious.

610
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:12,680
Drink in your room.

611
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,280
I'm going to the hot spring.

612
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,040
Fine.

613
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:18,480
I'll stop. Let's drink.

614
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,240
Hi, this dessert is on the house.

615
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,240
Please enjoy.

616
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,400
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

617
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:50,040
Didn't you say
that you're not easy to get?

618
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,560
You almost ran out the door.

619
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:02,840
<i>Come to the garden.</i>

620
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,840
I thought you would be asleep.

621
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:46,040
No, Luo Wenyue came to drink with me.

622
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:52,320
Are you fond of Luo Wenyue?

623
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:54,880
She's quite nice.

624
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,080
You haven't told me.

625
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:00,760
What are you doing here?

626
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,480
Do you own the hotel?

627
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:06,160
If there's nothing else, I'm leaving.

628
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,080
Hey!

629
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:13,400
Why are you being hot and cold with me?

630
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:17,360
Didn't you say that
you liked me two days ago?

631
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,800
Since you remember that,

632
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:26,520
you should know that
I'm staying away on purpose.

633
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:28,920
Why did you follow me to Suzhou?

634
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:36,880
I have always wanted to come
to Yangcheng Lake.

635
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:41,200
Since I'm unemployed,
I came here to relax.

636
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,680
While I'm at it, I want to ask you.

637
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:49,200
What did I tell you
during the five-hour call?

638
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:52,280
I see. Is it because of that?

639
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,600
Fine, I'll be honest with you.

640
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:55,720
It was nothing.

641
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:58,000
You were drunk talking,
so I have forgotten.

642
00:39:58,120 --> 00:39:59,120
That's impossible!

643
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:01,800
Do you think I'm a kid?

644
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,000
Why do you keep asking?

645
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,480
They were just lies after all.

646
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:09,160
Will you be responsible
for your drunk talk?

647
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,520
Then tell me.

648
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,280
If I can do it, I'll do it.

649
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:22,280
You proposed to me.

650
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:24,720
That's impossible.

651
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:27,800
Fine, I'll take that you've never said it.

652
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,440
I know myself.

653
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:34,480
Even if I was dead drunk,
I wouldn't say that.

654
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,720
Perhaps you were too drunk.

655
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:41,120
You said you broke up.
I bet that's not true.

656
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:44,960
About that...

657
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:49,160
I didn't sleep well last night.
I'm going back to sleep.

658
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:51,040
What's your plan for tomorrow?

659
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:57,360
I'm just looking around.

660
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:00,520
We're going to the lake tomorrow.

661
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:01,680
Do you want to join?

662
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:04,200
Can I?

663
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:10,080
But I don't really know Luo Wenyue.

664
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:13,160
You're right.

665
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:14,520
Hey!

666
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:16,600
I'll go.

667
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:19,520
See you tomorrow.

668
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:22,120
Good night.

669
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:45,720
Yuan Song,
will there be crabs in the lake?

670
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,720

I want mango ice cream.

Go and eat it then. Don't be so gross.

674
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:08,840
I don't care. I want to eat it.

Buy one for me.

Fine, I'll buy it for you.

Mango ice cream.

Hey.

682
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:39,440
Fanxing, I made a reservation

Do you want to join us?
