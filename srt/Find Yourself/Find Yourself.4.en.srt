1
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,480
Ms. He is very reputable in the office.

2
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,920
Everyone likes her.

3
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,800
Every employee hopes to have
a competent boss like her.

4
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,240
Goodness.

5
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,320
Well, Fanxing is just a director,

6
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,360
not some incredible employer.

7
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,920
Don't be afraid of her,
she's just a paper tiger.

8
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,680
Unlike Canyang,
he's as mischievous as a monkey.

9
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,040
A monkey?

10
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,480
Canyang is so naughty.

11
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,640
When he was little, he always came home

12
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:28,520
covered in mud from head to toe
like a monkey.

13
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,360
Fanxing is the opposite.

14
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,920
She has always been strong-willed
and loves being neat.

15
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,840
When they were little,
I dreaded the weekends.

16
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,040
When they were at home,

17
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,600
it was like Sun Wukong wreaking havoc

18
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,000
when he was imprisoned
under Buddha's Wuzhi Mountain.

19
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,720
Professor He was afraid of Ms. He?

20
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,880
Of course.

21
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,400
Like predators and prey.

22
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,280
I was just being nice to her.

23
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,480
If I wasn't nice and made her cry,

24
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,760
the duster on the shoe cabinet
would be waiting for me.

25
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,520
My mom used it to clean vases,
but my dad used it to beat me.

26
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:01,400
Didn't she always defend you
whenever your dad punished you?

27
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,280
Both brother and sister
really are very close.

28
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,720
They always fight when they're together,

29
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,600
but miss each other when they are apart.

30
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,320
They're over 30,
but they still act like children.

31
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,720
Yuan Song, I bet a handsome boy like you

32
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,360
have a girlfriend.

33
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,520
No, I'm single.

34
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,320
What do your parents do?

35
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,000
Are you local?

36
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,120
My mom was a botanist.

37
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,480
My dad is a businessman.

38
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,440
I can be considered a local.

39
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,160
But I grew up in Beijing with my grandpa.

40
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,640
Old lady, why are you asking so much?

41
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,960
Are you looking for a son-in-law?

42
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,320
Yuan Song, listen. I have a niece

43
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,560
who should be two years older than you.

44
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,400
She graduated from a top university

45
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,600
and is now a public servant.

46
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,440
Stop.

47
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,360
If you keep doing this,
he'll never come over again.

48
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,720
Canyang.

49
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,320
Lunch is ready, go set the table.

50
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,440
Coming!

51
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,840
I'll do it, Mr. He.

52
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,240
Fanxing, lunch is ready.

53
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,480
Okay.

54
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,360
-Here.
-Okay.

55
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,840
-Mom.
-Yes?

56
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:17,920
There was an issue with the company's
invoice and I have to go and handle it.

57
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,160
I'm also meeting Xiaoyu
and Song Xue later.

58
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,440
Well, go on then.

59
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,680
-Okay.
-Ms. He, drive safe.

60
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,480
Okay.

61
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,920
-Enjoy your meal.
-All right.

62
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,880
Yuan Song,

63
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,600
please help yourself.

64
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,280
Take whatever you want.

65
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,560
Okay, I'll make myself at home.

66
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,360
Pour the wine.

67
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,960
Let it sit for five minutes.
Let's eat first.

68
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,880
-Yuan Song, help yourself.
-Yes, sir.

69
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,920
-Here, have some more.
-Okay.

70
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,600
Both of you are my most important clients.

71
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,680
Amazing Decoration
focuses on the homes of newlyweds.

72
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,840
Mr. Zhao is in
the wedding planning business.

73
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,960
Both of you have the same target market.

74
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,640
If you can collaborate
and promote each other,

75
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,000
there's no doubt you'll both thrive.

76
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:03,240
I welcome the idea with open arms.

77
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,680
It's just that young people nowadays

78
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,920
prefer buying houses before marriage.

79
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,240
If we work together,

80
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,240
I'm afraid Mr. Li
will suffer losses instead.

81
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,120
I don't see how that would be the case.

82
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:19,160
Meiyi Wedding Planners is expanding.

83
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:22,080
If we can collaborate in the long run,

84
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,880
I wouldn't mind short-term losses.

85
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,160
Mr. Li, you're quite visionary.

86
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,320
Here's to you, Mr. Li.

87
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,320
A toast.

88
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,760
-Thank you.
-A toast to you too.

89
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,200
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

90
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,520
I'm sorry. Please wait for a moment.

91
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,080
The billing machine is almost fixed.

92
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,200
It's okay.

93
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,400
Where's the washroom?

94
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,040
Turn left and it's at the end of the hall.

95
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,720
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

96
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,200
What a coincidence.

97
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,280
Indeed.

98
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,440
You left a note saying that
the dress was torn.

99
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,720
Yes, it was an accident. I'm sorry.

100
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,480
Your dog chewed it up, right?

101
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,440
Your dog can take money

102
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,160
and chew up a dress.

103
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,120
What a loyal dog.

104
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,960
No, it was something else.

105
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,160
Mr. Ye.

106
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,080
I'm just a director.

107
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,320
If you have something against me,

108
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,720
I won't argue and make excuses.

109
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,920
But

110
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:55,200
our company has been working
with your company for so long.

111
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:58,240
If I left a bad impression on you,

112
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,560
I hope it won't affect my company.

113
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,720
Of course not.

114
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,760
Business is still business.

115
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:05,960
That's good to hear.

116
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,280
Thank you for being so forgiving.

117
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,640
Just consider this as a rough spell.

118
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,880
And try to forget this unhappy episode.

119
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,840
I'm sorry for taking up your time.

120
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,680
I wonder when we'll see each other again.

121
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,920
If it were someone else,

122
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,480
you would have been successful.

123
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:35,720
How to win back a person's heart
step by step.

124
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:39,160
This is straight from the textbook.

125
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,720
I find this very interesting.

126
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:45,120
So, when are you
setting up our next encounter?

127
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,360
Did you think I purposely came here

128
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,400
to lead you on?

129
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,800
Didn't you know that I would be here,
in this restaurant today?

130
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,280
I did.

131
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,520
I don't know what to say.

132
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,320
Anyway, we won't meet again.

133
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,400
But I have a feeling that...

134
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,600
we'll run into each other again.

135
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,840
Come on now, don't cry.

136
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,360
Please don't cry.

137
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,120
Please don't cry.

138
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,360
I won't be able to explain myself!

139
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,920
I'm so fed up.

140
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:50,240
How can there be such a narcissistic man?

141
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,720
A peacock fanning its feathers around,

142
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,800
thinking he's so irresistible.

143
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,080
I was dumbfounded.

144
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,680
I should have mocked him there and then.

145
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,680
There are three situations in life
where one is off their game.

146
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,480
The first is in exams.

147
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,840
The second is in fights.

148
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,120
The third is on the first date.

149
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:13,640
There's also the 3-in-1 ultimate test.

150
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,040
The blind date.

151
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,200
Coincidentally,

152
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,840
I'm going on a blind date next week.

153
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,320
Are you still going on blind dates?

154
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:23,960
I don't think you should.

155
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,520
It's all in vain anyway.

156
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,240
You'll only be wasting your time
and be judged on every aspect.

157
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,760
Even if I'll be judged,
both sides will be judged anyway.

158
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,120
It's not one-sided after all.

159
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,480
Who knows when and how love will happen.

160
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,280
When you turn a corner?

161
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,040
Or maybe in a cafe with my blind date?

162
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,880
Since there is a saying,

163
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,520
"Love at first sight",

164
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:51,960
it proves that there's still
a chance of this happening.

165
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,440
Little girl,

166
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,720
you're still so naive and cute.

167
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,840
The purpose of blind dates
is for marriage.

168
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,200
If it's for romance and not marriage,

169
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:07,120
then it's the same as
behaving like a hooligan.

170
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:11,440
"If you plant a seed in spring,
you'll have a son by autumn.

171
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,480
When you return home during New Year,

172
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,640
another descendant's name will be added

173
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,200
to the ancestral tablet."

174
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,560
Time is life!

175
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:24,080
Yes, I agree with Xiaoyu.

176
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,360
After one turns 30,
the odds of finding love at first sight

177
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,600
is the same as winning the lottery.

178
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,840
Besides, you're just
a pathetic little girl

179
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:35,760
who has never even won a lucky draw.

180
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,120
Hitting the jackpot?

181
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,800
Just keep your innocence
and wait for the next life.

182
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,800
Next life?

183
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,360
A virgin can't reincarnate, right?

184
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,160
Petty superstition.

185
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:56,840
Moreover, she's a virgin
who hasn't even had her first kiss.

186
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,160
What? You finally did it?

187
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,200
You really had your first kiss?

188
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,960
Stop eating. Scoot over.

189
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,560
Who was it?

190
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,960
I was drunk.

191
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,640
I may have kissed a male colleague.

192
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,600
A drunk play.

193
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35,720
I like it!

194
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,160
Have you known him long?

195
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,840
He's the new intern.

196
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,320
A young hunk!

197
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:47,320
I like this! Is he cute?

198
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,560
He's not bad.

199
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,080
How did he react?

200
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,680
How would he react?

201
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,680
I mean, after that,

202
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,400
did he avoid you,
look at you or follow you?

203
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,080
No.

204
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,360
Nothing has changed.

205
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,240
Game over then.

206
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,200
It never even started.

207
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,480
He's ten years younger than me.

208
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,080
It's impossible.

209
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,800
That's not true.

210
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:19,600
Age is never a problem for love.

211
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,600
Back in our 20s,

212
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,080
we bravely went after whoever we admired.

213
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,000
But as we grow older,

214
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:29,720
these young hearts get buried
under life and responsibilities.

215
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,360
But it's never gone.

216
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:34,360
So when you meet someone you like,
the heart still flutters.

217
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,920
But as you want to make a move,

218
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,200
you'll inevitably think twice.

219
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:45,280
I guess that's the trouble of growing up.

220
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,360
Ms. Sophisticated is troubled.

221
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,520
Gone is our youth.

222
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,880
So, we shall reminisce.

223
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,360
But all of our experiences
are quite amazing.

224
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,840
He Fanxing had the most suitors in school,

225
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,280
but she never once had a boyfriend.

226
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,800
Xiaoyu was like a tomboy,

227
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:09,320
always fighting those bad boys
for the girls in the class.

228
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,680
Out of all expectations, you fell in love

229
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,240
and was the first to get married
after we graduated from university.

230
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,360
Now you're even expecting a second child.

231
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:20,840
As for me, I liked role-playing
as a mother since I was little.

232
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:23,880
I never expected that I would be
a "dual income, no kids" kind-of-wife.

233
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,480
You were traumatized by your first love.

234
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,320
You deserved it!

235
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:32,920
Back in the day, that jerk, He Canyang
and I always fought with each other.

236
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,160
But her? She secretly went off dating.

237
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,320
That's enough.

238
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:40,760
You yanked his hair
while giving birth to your Peanut.

239
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,240
And you call him a jerk,
is that even proper?

240
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,920
So what? No matter how we are now,

241
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:48,160
once a jerk, always a jerk.

242
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,440
Right, Fanxing?

243
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:58,720
Who's taking care of Peanut
when you're here?

244
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:01,960
Her dad. He took Peanut dancing.

245
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:05,280
I've served my sentence
and I am a free woman now.

246
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,240
You're just on parole.

247
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:24,320
I just told you.
I didn't mean to lose Albatross.

248
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:28,000
I meant Love Charm!

249
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,240
"Love Charm"?

250
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,080
The dog brought me rotten love instead.

251
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,440
What a crybaby.

252
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,960
Yes, I said it's rotten love.

253
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,520
She's nothing but a gold digger.

254
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:42,760
Don't worry.

255
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,720
Su Li will introduce me to her junior.

256
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:47,920
Maybe I'll fall for her
at first sight, all right?

257
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:53,520
Stop crying already.
I'll take good care of Minmin.

258
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,440
I have to go.

259
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10,480
LOST DOG FOUND

260
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,960
Albatross, is that you?

261
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,160
<i>Mr. Ye.</i>

262
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,120
Yes?

263
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,160
What took you so long?

264
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,640
Are you trying to avoid drinking?

265
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,400
Mr. Li, we have to punish him.

266
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,840
Punish!

267
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:34,840
That's slander.

268
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,400
I ran into Ms. He from Mr. Li's company,

269
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,640
so we chatted a bit.

270
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:40,840
Ms. He?

271
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,280
She must be dealing with an invoice.

272
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,000
We rely on Ms. He for various matters

273
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,000
regarding the company.

274
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,120
She isn't even free on weekends.

275
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:51,800
Dealing with an invoice?

276
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,840
There was an issue
when submitting the expenses.

277
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,840
Shouldn't a subordinate do this?

278
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,280
Our company is small.

279
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:04,200
There's only one director
and an assistant in administration.

280
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:07,960
We don't have
a clear-cut division of labor

281
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,440
like big companies.

282
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:13,840
Ms. He is in charge of
different matters of the company.

283
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:16,600
In a way,
she's busier than me as a manager.

284
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,080
Only two employees in administration?

285
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:22,160
We have a director and three others
in that department,

286
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,160
and they are even
up to their necks with work.

287
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,640
That director is not married, right?

288
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:29,880
Yes.

289
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,880
From what I know,
she never even once had a boyfriend.

290
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,200
Never?

291
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,160
Yes.

292
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:40,600
She said she hasn't met the one she likes.

293
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,840
Youngsters want someone they like.

294
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,080
Old-timers want the right one.

295
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:51,200
Maybe, for Ms. He,
the right one is the one she likes.

296
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,160
Well said.

297
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:58,160
Mr. Ye, aren't you single too?

298
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:01,840
Are you looking for someone you like

299
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,600
or the right person?

300
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:07,240
Me? I'm childish.

301
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:08,720
I'm waiting for destiny.

302
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,800
You're so funny.

303
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,760
-Come. Let's toast to the destined one.
-Let's toast.

304
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,800
Whatever.

305
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,920
I owe that crybaby nothing.

306
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:25,960
Time for bed.

307
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,480
You like reading,
so why don't we get an arc floor lamp?

308
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:40,240
The designer can pick
a pair of comfy armchairs for us.

309
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,320
That's not a problem.

310
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,320
From now on, we'll read together here.

311
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,400
And I'll go to the gym with you.

312
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,280
-Sure. Let's take a look at the bedroom.
-Okay.

313
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:55,160
Isn't this nice? They're so sweet.

314
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,640
Confess to Cong Xiao if you're envious.

315
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58,760
Why should I?

316
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,320
Is she the only woman in the world?

317
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,360
Forget it.

318
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,440
Ridiculous.

319
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:11,320
Looking at them
makes me believe in blind dates again.

320
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:12,800
Blind dates?

321
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,440
That's how they met?

322
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,080
It's a miracle.

323
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,720
Their families live on the same floor.

324
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,040
Their moms met through square dancing.

325
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:28,320
The lady is now 30,
but no guy was to her liking.

326
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,200
Her mom was worried sick.

327
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,640
She was so helpless.

328
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,720
The guy studied in Australia
after high school.

329
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,520
He just got back and came to work here.

330
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,760
Over 30.

331
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,320
Never touched a girl's hand.

332
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,800
After their moms started talking,

333
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:44,840
they decided to let them meet
and try their luck.

334
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,840
In the end, something magical happened.

335
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,880
Did love blossom on the blind date?

336
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,560
No, not even close.

337
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:54,520
On the second day back here,
he took the trash out

338
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,880
and ran into the lady
who was on her way to work.

339
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,680
Their eyes met.

340
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,280
Fireworks exploded.

341
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,320
Love at first sight.

342
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,440
-They hit the jackpot.
-They hit the jackpot.

343
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,960
The 3rd phase of the Zhujiang Garden's
project handover is on the 23rd.

344
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:18,760
The 3rd phase has a rigid demand
for 75 to 110 square meter units

345
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:21,360
with two to three bedrooms.

346
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,360
Exactly our target market.

347
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,080
Apart from us, both Aijia and Chengxing

348
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,640
are well-known renovation companies.

349
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,440
The sales gallery is a very narrow space.

350
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:34,640
It's best if the buyers
see our booth first.

351
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,440
Cong Xiao, you take care of the booth.

352
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:38,960
Mr. Li.

353
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,200
Aijia always gets the best location.

354
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,840
Last time, they used their banner
to block us.

355
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,520
They are such bullies.

356
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,400
Fight for it!

357
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,080
Aijia has a showroom in the gallery,
while we don't have one.

358
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,360
We do not only need a salesperson,

359
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,960
but also a designer to be there

360
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:01,840
to personally talk to customers.

361
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,680
Chang Huan will be the one to go.

362
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:04,960
Yuan Song,

363
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:08,520
when he's done with his clients,
pass my message to him.

364
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,200
-Ms. He.
-Yes.

365
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:15,960
You prepare the gift bags
and marketing material.

366
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,240
Noted.

367
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:21,800
This is a promo package jointly launched
with Meiyi Wedding Planners.

368
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,600
It is a great offer.

369
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,560
Let's work hard and increase sales.

370
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:28,560
We'll discuss other details individually.

371
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,840
Work hard!

372
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,280
Dismissed.

373
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,560
Good luck!

374
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,280
6:30 p.m. at the statue in the park.

375
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:08,920
Are you going

376
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,680
on a blind date this weekend?

377
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,360
Yes.

378
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,760
You shouldn't go.

379
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:16,880
Why?

380
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,480
I already promised Cong Xiao.

381
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:22,440
You won't find a boyfriend on blind dates.

382
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,560
It's like buying a lottery ticket.

383
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:32,080
People always compare slim chances
to buying a lottery ticket.

384
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:35,680
But people still buy tickets
all the time. Right?

385
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,480
And there's always a winner.

386
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:42,000
Some people know they might never win.

387
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,400
Then why buy tickets at all?

388
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,160
Why?

389
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,720
Some things might be of a high risk

390
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:53,440
with a high return or no return at all.

391
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,200
But not when it comes to the lottery

392
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,840
where it's possible for a low-risk,
but high-return investment.

393
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,440
In my neighborhood, there's an old man.

394
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,800
He's a heavy smoker.

395
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,320
He is never without a cigarette.

396
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,840
But ever since he started
buying lottery tickets,

397
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,840
he would use his cigarette money

398
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,920
for the lottery without fail.

399
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,440
Guess what happened?

400
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,640
Did he win something?

401
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,320
Lotteries change lives.

402
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,080
He quit smoking!

403
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:27,880
So you see, the odds of winning
the lottery is ten million to one.

404
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:31,400
The odds of a plane crash
is three million to one.

405
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,360
So many things
have a near-zero probability,

406
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,200
but they still happen, right?

407
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,520
Those who win the lottery

408
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,520
has to come from those
who buys lottery tickets.

409
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,480
If your theory stands,
you don't need blind dates.

410
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:49,360
You only need to stand at
a busy intersection during rush hour.

411
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,800
Heavy traffic means more people.

412
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,280
Just wait there
until you meet someone's gaze.

413
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:57,360
The odds of love at first sight there
beats blind dates'.

414
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,280
You go to work in the morning

415
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:02,720
and run into a returnee
who is out emptying his garbage bin.

416
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,320
And then you fall in love at first sight.

417
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,640
The tale of
"First encounter, but he looks familiar."

418
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:07,760
It's nothing but a myth.

419
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:10,440
Like a carrot
dangled before a mule on a mill.

420
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:13,680
Then, do you think the mule is

421
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:17,480
happier with or without the carrot?

422
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,520
Doesn't the mule know

423
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,760
that it will never be able
to get the carrot?

424
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:24,560
So, you mean humans are like mules.

425
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,000
We like deceiving ourselves?

426
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:29,280
What I mean is we have to have dreams.

427
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,080
What if it comes true?

428
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:33,360
So you're still going to it
no matter what?

429
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,600
Well, even if he and I can't be lovers,

430
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,280
we can still be friends.

431
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:41,600
Befriending your date?
Don't you have any friends?

432
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,840
Why are you mad?

433
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,520
Little brat.

434
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,400
Are you so anxious for love?

435
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:57,160
It's the top priority on my wish list.

436
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,440
Of course, I am.

437
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:03,880
Will I do?

438
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:08,920
What?

439
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:16,040
Compared to a blind date,

440
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,920
am I not a better choice?

441
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,720
Won't you consider me?

442
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,840
Do you feel nothing for me?

443
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,840
Yuan Song!

444
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:40,600
Who is she?

445
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:43,680
-I--
-My girlfriend.

446
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:45,440
Your girlfriend?

447
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:52,200
Where's Braised Meat?

448
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,800
Bean misses him so much.

449
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,720
You guys chat, I need to find my dog.

450
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,040
-Baylor!
-I have to go.

451
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:05,120
The store has the cream
I told you about in stock.

452
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,400
I'll send you the address.

453
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,520
Okay.

454
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:17,760
Did he just confess to me?

455
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,560
Did he just confess to me?

456
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:27,960
Is he doing this because of a dare,
or is he making fun of me?

457
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:32,600
Which is it?

458
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,600
Steven, your thinking is pretty off.

459
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:43,600
He's an independent man first
and your son second, right?

460
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,720
Do you think you're in a TV drama?

461
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:50,160
A bossy chairman
forcing his son to inherit your business.

462
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:53,120
And your daughter?
Will you arrange a marriage for her too?

463
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,760
All right.

464
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,480
Let's have a drink one day.

465
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,200
I'm down on my luck too.

466
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:05,480
I walked Love Charm the other day
and the collar came loose and it ran away.

467
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,720
Love Charm!

468
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,280
Love Charm!

469
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,040
Love Charm!

470
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,280
Love Charm?

471
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,800
Love Charm, why are you here?

472
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,400
Are you lost again?

473
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:42,040
If your narcissist dad sees me,
he'll humiliate me again.

474
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:44,200
What should I tell him?

475
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,040
Love Charm!

476
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:48,960
Love Charm!

477
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,240
Love Charm!

478
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:57,720
I was just sitting here.

479
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,400
It just ran straight towards me.

480
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:01,520
I wasn't following you around.

481
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:02,960
Well...

482
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:07,360
Maybe I'm the only one it knows here,
so it ran to me.

483
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:10,960
I swear I didn't take it
while you weren't noticing!

484
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,160
I swear!

485
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,440
Calm down.

486
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,880
I wasn't thinking about that at all.

487
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:21,080
Well, my place is near the park.

488
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,880
So I often walk my dog here.

489
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:25,240
I really didn't follow you here.

490
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,520
It's true!

491
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:31,240
I really live nearby!

492
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:33,880
I can show you my ID.

493
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,400
It's not with me.

494
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:39,520
I'll send a copy to your company tomorrow.

495
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:44,480
It has been cleared up now.

496
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,160
It was my mistake.

497
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:48,600
I saw your lost dog notice.

498
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,240
You really weren't after my money

499
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,040
or me.

500
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,120
I'd like to apologize.

501
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:58,520
I was too dismissive and misjudged you.

502
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,200
I'm sorry.

503
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,480
It's all right.

504
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:06,920
You're too nice.

505
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:09,000
You were so angry before.

506
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,960
With just one apology
and now you're all right.

507
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,960
Can you really forgive me like that?

508
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:23,960
Of course.

509
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,600
It's not a big deal.

510
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,760
Your dog.

511
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,480
I should go.

512
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,560
Can I treat you to a meal?

513
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,080
There's no need for that.

514
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:36,840
I don't think it's a good idea.

515
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:39,880
If I eat with you
or get involved with you,

516
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:42,040
you'll think I'm seducing you again.

517
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,520
I'm going to go now.

518
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,120
Go! Let's go!

519
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:48,080
You have such long legs, slow down!

520
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,480
Don't run so fast!

521
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,360
Love Charm.

522
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,600
Love Charm!

523
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,280
You really work!

524
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:38,880
Aren't Thai horror movies
supposed to be really terrifying?

525
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,000
I only see

526
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:44,440
a green face moving around

527
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,320
with ketchup on it.

528
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,240
What did I tell you?

529
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:51,880
There's nothing to it.

530
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:54,760
It's just a green face with ketchup on it.

531
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,280
You even said,

532
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:59,280
"I know it's fake,
but it's still so scary."

533
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,720
Good for you, then.

534
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:03,480
Watching enough of these movies
has made you immune.

535
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,720
If a guy takes you to the movies now,

536
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:09,240
it will look fake
when you act scared and lean on him.

537
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:15,560
Asking someone out for a horror movie
is such an old trick.

538
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,720
If you do that these days,

539
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,960
it's so obvious that it'll be so awkward.

540
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,600
You missed its heydays, then.

541
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:26,480
Someone invited you back in the day,
but you just didn't go.

542
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:28,440
I didn't like him, why would I go?

543
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,520
Who knows?

544
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:32,720
You could have seen the ketchup,
had your heart race and then fell in love.

545
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:35,880
So, that's how you got Nana?

546
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:37,760
Nana?

547
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,720
Nana, who?

548
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:42,000
The one who looked like Liu Yifei.

549
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,800
The belle of the faculty
who was the hardest to get.

550
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:49,320
She failed her exam and was very sad,

551
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:52,400
so you took her to a horror movie
to ease her mind.

552
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:55,200
After the movie, you took her to a hotel.

553
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:58,000
Did I really do that?

554
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,200
Your hand is oily!

555
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:08,480
Nana regretted it
after dating you for just two weeks.

556
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:09,880
Therefore,

557
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:13,000
the increased heart rate
when watching a horror movie is a myth.

558
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:15,240
It's all due to hormones.

559
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:17,400
I want true love.

560
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,600
Sex maniacs like you won't understand.

561
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,560
All right, you want true love.

562
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:25,120
But how love happens

563
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:27,240
is closely related to the atmosphere.

564
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:29,640
The atmosphere?

565
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:38,400
Two chemicals are put together,
but there's no reaction.

566
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:42,680
But through heat, liquids, electricity,
or the use of catalysts,

567
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:44,440
a chemical reaction occurs.

568
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:47,760
It's like putting two people who are
not interested with each other

569
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:50,760
in a dark movie theater,

570
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:53,120
or have them dancing in dim light,

571
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:56,200
or have them stuck in a broken-down lift,

572
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:58,560
or under a tree
with petals falling all around them,

573
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:01,240
with the guy who happens to be
in a white shirt

574
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:03,120
and so on.

575
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,520
A specific atmosphere

576
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:08,560
can be a catalyst for love.

577
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:11,840
So how do you tell

578
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:15,080
if you're being charmed by the atmosphere

579
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:17,240
or you're really falling in love?

580
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:20,360
Woman, you just asked the right question.

581
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:23,800
Love itself is confusing.

582
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:26,720
You feel dizzy, infatuated,

583
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:30,120
feverish and insecure.

584
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,680
Therefore, love isn't a thing
that can be rationalized.

585
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:34,600
Ask your heart.

586
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:37,400
Does your heart race?

587
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,560
Does your throat feel dry?

588
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:42,880
Do you avoid eye contact,
but you can't help looking?

589
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:46,240
Do you try to run away,
but your legs feel like jelly?

590
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:52,080
Did you sneak a peek
at Ms. Song's teaching materials?

591
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,440
I speak from experience.

592
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,920
<i>Compared to a blind date,</i>

593
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,760
<i>am I not a better choice?</i>

594
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:30,040
Why not? Doesn't your firm need interns?

595
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:33,240
All our internship positions
have been filled.

596
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:34,480
And I'm so busy.

597
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:36,840
Young people nowadays aren't as bright.

598
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:39,440
Not only is he bright,
he's attractive too.

599
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:46,080
There's no harm in having
eye candy like him in the office.

600
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:48,120
Are you not going to grab your stuff?

601
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:49,840
Give me a minute.

602
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,920
Yuan Song, hurry up. We'll be late.

603
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:24,239
Coming.

604
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,440
Let's go.

605
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,639
What are you looking at? Let's go.

606
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:49,120
You really want your student
to be an intern in my firm?

607
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:50,960
Didn't you say no? It's fine.

608
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:54,679
It's not completely impossible.

609
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,400
Really?

610
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:58,880
It's for my brother after all.

611
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:01,760
What?

612
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:15,000
-Cong Xiao.
-Ms. He?

613
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:16,840
Take a look at this.

614
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,440
For this promotion,

615
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:20,040
the offer for this package...

616
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,160
is this, right?

617
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,840
The half-option price is right.

618
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,440
For the two all-option,

619
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,720
we've changed some of the items.

620
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,520
These two need to be changed.

621
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,320
Hello, may I know--

622
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,960
-Over there.
-Thank you.

623
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,760
What about this? Is this correct?

624
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:39,240
-Hello.
-This--

625
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,200
-May I know if you--
-It's for me.

626
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,520
Please sign this.

627
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,520
Where's the other delivery guy?

628
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,760
-Here you go.
-Did your boss drop by today?

629
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,160
He's there now.

630
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:53,800
For the ocean song flowers,
I prefer lavender-colored ones.

631
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,240
Your boss knows my preferences.

632
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,640
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

633
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:04,320
A new boyfriend?

634
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:07,360
Not yet. I'm still considering it.

635
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:10,280
What is he like?

636
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:11,760
He has his own flower shop.

637
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:15,000
He looks sharp
and has a good personality too.

638
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,520
When we met yesterday,

639
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,800
he gave me a supplementary credit card

640
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,880
and said I can buy whatever I wanted.

641
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,800
Let's go shopping after work.

642
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:25,440
You can buy some clothes
for your weekend date.

643
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:27,680
Okay.

644
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:30,760
Hello.

645
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,320
I just realized I got the wrong person.

646
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,000
Are you Ms. He Fanxing?

647
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:41,800
That's me.

648
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:55,760
PLEASE FORGIVE THIS STUPID AND COCKY MAN
FOR GIVING YOU BAD MEMORIES.

649
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,000
FROM YE LUMING

650
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,720
YOUR DELIVERY WAS RECEIVED BY HE FANXING

651
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:18,680
ROTTEN LOVE

652
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:21,480
LOVE

653
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:25,880
You called, sir?

654
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:28,520
Close the door.

655
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:37,480
Please help me cancel
this weekend's blind date.

656
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:41,440
We're at work right now
and you're my boss.

657
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,760
It was my cousin who agreed to the date.

658
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:46,800
As your boss,
I apologize on behalf of your cousin.

659
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:47,920
Sir,

660
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,960
please ask my cousin
to talk to me himself. Okay?

661
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:52,400
Okay.

662
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:54,920
Hello.

663
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,720
Didn't we have a deal?
Just go and have a meal with her.

664
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:58,880
I can't.

665
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,920
I've met someone I like.

666
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:02,800
Really?

667
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:07,560
My junior already told her colleague.

668
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:10,480
It's okay if I embarrass myself.

669
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,000
But what about my junior?

670
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:14,880
If things don't work out for her
in that company,

671
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:15,920
tell her

672
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:19,680
Minglu Advertising
welcomes her with open arms.

673
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,680
MS. HE

674
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:34,000
I'm busy enough cleaning up after my boss.

675
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:37,240
My cousin, you can clean up your own mess.
I have work to do.

676
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:46,240
The employees now...

677
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:48,600
What can they really do?

678
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:53,400
I'll just handle it myself.
What's the big deal?

679
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:55,800
Ms. He.

680
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,080
LOVE

681
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:08,640
He...

682
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,360
<i>Hello?</i>

683
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,680
Hello?

684
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:16,560
Mr. Ye, what's the matter?

685
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:19,440
It's nothing.

686
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:20,960
Well...

687
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,520
Did you get the flowers?

688
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,240
Yes, I did. Thank you.

689
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:29,800
It was all a misunderstanding after all.

690
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:31,200
You shouldn't worry about it.

691
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:32,360
Okay.

692
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:34,840
I hope the next time we meet

693
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:37,800
will be a good and brand new start.

694
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,480
Of course.

695
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:43,120
You're a vital partner to our company.

696
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:46,160
And the dress...

697
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,840
There's no rush. There's no rush at all.

698
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,040
You can replace it whenever you like.

699
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:54,760
I won't keep you any longer then. Goodbye.

700
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,000
I'm taking your attendance now.

701
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,040
Cai Minmin.

702
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:29,800
Present.

703
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:32,280
And I'm done, let's begin.

704
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:38,840
Professor He,
who takes attendance like that?

705
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:42,640
I said this before
that I'd call your name.

706
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:44,360
I can't call everyone's name.

707
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:46,880
We can't forsake
those sleeping in at 10 a.m.,

708
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:49,760
and those not back
from staying out at cybercafes.

709
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,640
Enough with the laughing. Let's start.

710
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:56,520
We're going to talk about Mondrian today.

711
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:57,920
"Stay calm"?

712
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,800
Why is Professor He picking on me?

713
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,680
I'm going to give him a piece of my mind!

714
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,240
<i>I think he was quite cute.</i>

715
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:05,800
<i>He only called your name
like a bossy chairman.</i>

716
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:08,240
This is my chicken!

717
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:23,840
Professor He.

718
00:41:56,320 --> 00:42:00,120
Song Xue, please help me.

719
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:02,440
Please help me. This is the last time.

720
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:04,480
Professor Song.

721
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:08,520
Just tell me, yes or no?

722
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:10,320
Professor He,

723
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:13,280
we modern women are very busy.

724
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:14,840
We teach in school

725
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:17,000
and do TV programs afterward.

726
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:20,960
Besides, I've heard
what a fighter your ex is.

727
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:24,480
Your sister's dress was over 10,000 yuan
and she just tore right through it.

728
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,160
I'm a talker.

729
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:29,080
But she's a doer.

730
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:32,920
If I tell her
to stop pestering He Canyang,

731
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:36,120
she may think I'm a mistress
and rip me apart.

732
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:38,640
At least, you'll die with no regrets.

733
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:42,080
You're the woman I like the most
after my mom and sister.

734
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:46,200
We're each other's first love after all.

735
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:48,920
Listen up, He Canyang.

736
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:50,840
If anyone finds out about this,

737
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:53,480
forget your ex-girlfriend,
I'll rip you apart!

738
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:56,360
I won't tell anyone. Just help me.

739
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:59,440
She paints my car
with the lipsticks I bought her.

740
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:00,800
Isn't that such a waste?

741
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:03,600
This is the last time.

742
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:07,080
-Thank you.
-Stop it. You're so annoying.

743
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:10,200
Bye, Professor Song.

744
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:15,280
Yes!

745
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:20,880
