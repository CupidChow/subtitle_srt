1
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,800
I'll be going in then.

2
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,600
Let's go for a meal someday.

3
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,080
Sure. Keep in touch.

4
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,400
-Go home then.
-Bye.

5
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,320
Fanxing!

6
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:31,960
Mrs. Wang.

7
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,640
Did you just finish shopping?

8
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,040
Yes, baby products
are on sale at the mall.

9
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,800
I have twin granddaughters.

10
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,080
So everything has to be doubled.

11
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:42,040
Kids grow quickly,
so I'm just getting prepared.

12
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,160
You must be Fanxing's boyfriend.

13
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,800
-I--
-No. He's my good friend.

14
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,360
Mrs. Wang, right? Hi.

15
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,120
I'll go now.

16
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,520
-Bye.
-Bye.

17
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,280
Come over with Fanxing sometime.

18
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,440
Sure.

19
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,840
Let me help you.

20
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,280
Sure.

21
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,720
Fanxing.

22
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,080
Is he really not your boyfriend?

23
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,480
Just a good friend.

24
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,840
The fat expert from The Love Clinic said

25
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,480
men and women can never be just friends.

26
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,680
Don't listen to that fat expert.

27
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,280
Why not listen to Ms. Song?

28
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,040
I hate listening to Song Xue.

29
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,600
All her nonsensical theories.

30
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,320
A third party intruded.

31
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,240
But she said we can't blame the intruder.

32
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,360
If two people date
and their parents disagree,

33
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,600
it's for their own good.

34
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:29,960
She advised the parents
to understand their children.

35
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:32,400
Why can't children understand
their parents?

36
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,920
Yes, you're totally right.

37
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,400
Of course.

38
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,600
Fanxing, I've lived longer than you.

39
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,600
I mean no harm.

40
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,080
Come on, let's go.

41
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,680
Let's go.

42
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:55,120
Anyway, the guy that Fanxing is dating

43
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:56,920
drives a posh car,

44
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,320
looks really handsome
and is well-mannered.

45
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,320
Sun once said that

46
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,680
Fanxing was being too picky after her 30s

47
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,600
and could only date divorcees.

48
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:06,920
Look at her now.

49
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,720
The one she's dating is better than
all his daughters' boyfriends combined.

50
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:14,080
You make him sound like a saint.

51
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,280
Did you even meet him?

52
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,800
Of course, I met him!

53
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,000
He sent Fanxing home last night.

54
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,320
I bumped into them at the entrance.

55
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,040
I even told her

56
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,040
to bring him over someday.

57
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,720
Hey, Xiulian.

58
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,440
What did you see?

59
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,600
Speak of the devil.

60
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:33,600
Let me tell you.

61
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,840
A really good-looking man
sent Fanxing home yesterday.

62
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:37,880
How attentive.

63
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,440
He's probably just a friend.

64
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,800
Fanxing didn't tell me anything.

65
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,520
She just started dating.

66
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,520
If she told you,

67
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,280
you'd rush her to bring him home.

68
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,400
She told me that he's just a good friend.

69
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,680
But men and women

70
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:54,120
can never be just friends.

71
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,440
We've been through that.

72
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,400
We all know.

73
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,640
She's right.

74
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,680
Kids nowadays won't bring their dates home

75
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,560
if they're not ready to get married.

76
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,880
It'll be awkward if they break up.

77
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,000
Hongmei.

78
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,560
Your Fanxing

79
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,760
isn't exactly young.

80
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,720
If she meets a good guy,
she must hold on to him tight.

81
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:14,560
She can't afford
to take it slow like young girls.

82
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:17,040
Get married and have a child first.

83
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,360
Tie the man down.

84
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,280
After that,

85
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,880
there's plenty of time to get along.

86
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,320
"Tie him down"?

87
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,000
He's human, not a cow.

88
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:27,920
That's right.

89
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,400
How can you think of such a thing?

90
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,520
"Tie him down"?

91
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,440
It's more important
for them to like each other.

92
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,760
-Divorce rates are high now.
-Exactly.

93
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,160
Since you're so progressive,

94
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,200
why didn't you let

95
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,520
Jiacheng date Fang Shanshan?

96
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,080
How's that the same?

97
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,320
Would you want Fang Shanshan?

98
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,760
You're a hypocrite!

99
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,280
"Hypocrite"?

100
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,560
If I wasn't insistent,

101
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,680
how could I have twin granddaughters?

102
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,760
Look at how great my granddaughters are!

103
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,280
That's enough.

104
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,560
I haven't seen them for a while.

105
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,680
Show me your granddaughters. Let's go.

106
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,640
You've known each other for so long.

107
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:03,880
Don't quarrel.

108
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,440
You'll embarrass yourselves.

109
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,720
-Yes, let's go.
-Fine, you guys go ahead.

110
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,080
I'm going home with Hongmei.

111
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,360
All right, see you!

112
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,280
Okay.

113
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,160
Hurry, tell me.

114
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,600
What did you see?

115
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,680
When have I, Wang Xiulian, ever lied?

116
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,080
Trust me, Hongmei.

117
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,880
I have very good eyes.

118
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,600
They must be dating.

119
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,840
Dating?

120
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,640
<i>Firstly, keep your arm tucked in</i>

121
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,920
<i>and keep it still.</i>

122
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,560
<i>Secondly, breathe out loud</i>

123
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:31,920
<i>and breathe in slow.</i>

124
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,680
<i>Thirdly, don't let your body sway.</i>

125
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,200
<i>Fourthly...</i>

126
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,360
You're back early.

127
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,560
Didn't you go grocery shopping?

128
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,920
I was at the neighborhood's entrance.

129
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,680
But my stomach didn't feel good.

130
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:47,120
So I came back to use the toilet.

131
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,960
Dad, Mom. I'm off.

132
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:52,920
I'm going to work.

133
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,600
Dad, look. Am I pretty?

134
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,080
Yes.

135
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:01,800
Do I smell good?

136
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,240
Yes.

137
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,360
Just like the demon
in <i>Journey to the West</i>.

138
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,160
Go to work then.

139
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:10,760
Bye then.

140
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,000
Bye, Mom!

141
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,320
Come home early!

142
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,400
Okay.

143
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:17,800
Dad, Mom.

144
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,760
I won't be back for dinner.
I'm going out with my colleagues.

145
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:21,920
Don't cook for me.

146
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,080
Bye!

147
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,040
Bye.

148
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,720
She's

149
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,120
not coming back again.

150
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,880
Didn't you need the toilet?

151
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,160
I don't need it anymore.

152
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,760
What was that?

153
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:39,880
Yuan Song?

154
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,640
Who else did you expect?

155
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,880
I almost had a heart attack!

156
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,120
What's wrong?

157
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,360
Didn't you read the news?

158
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,800
You're dressed like this
and you kept your hands at the back.

159
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,760
You're like a robber hiding a knife.

160
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,800
I didn't realize it.

161
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,320
Sorry for scaring you.

162
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,480
It's fine.

163
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:02,920
How terrifying.

164
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,480
Other than keeping my distance
at work due to our agreement,

165
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,200
we have to keep our distance
in public too.

166
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,840
I can't even fulfill my duties
as a boyfriend.

167
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:17,440
Since you like to buy flowers anyway,

168
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,560
I'll give you now
and you can bring it to work.

169
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,240
Sorry

170
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:30,760
for just now.

171
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,560
Why are you apologizing?

172
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,640
Silly girl.

173
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,840
Why don't you go ahead?

174
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,920
I'll go have breakfast first.

175
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,560
I won't be late.

176
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,680
Don't worry.

177
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,400
Okay.

178
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,640
Bye.

179
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,560
Okay.

180
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,600
Such pretty flowers.

181
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,000
This should be expensive.

182
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,920
<i>I will do as the card says.</i>

183
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,520
Card?

184
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,040
Where's the card?

185
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,240
Card?

186
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:08,840
Ms. He.

187
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,480
Did you drop something?

188
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,320
-Let me help you.
-Don't worry.

189
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,680
I don't think I dropped it here.

190
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,440
It's fine. Carry on.

191
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,360
A gift card?

192
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,720
"Dearest

193
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,320
Cong Xiao.

194
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,520
You're a butterfly that

195
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,280
has flown into my life."

196
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,160
What's wrong, Ms. He?

197
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,360
The writing on this card

198
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,920
sounds so gross.

199
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,160
Yes, it really is.

200
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,680
He used to be charming.

201
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,000
Now, he's just an idiot.

202
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:50,600
Get back to work.

203
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,560
Okay.

204
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,080
You've searched everywhere.

205
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,840
It was probably dropped outside.

206
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:17,200
No one would care about a card.
Don't worry.

207
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,160
What did you write?

208
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:23,640
Nothing.
Just some typical romantic messages.

209
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,040
After all, everyone writes those

210
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,600
when they give flowers.

211
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,160
Did you write names?

212
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,080
Only yours.

213
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,120
It's fine then.

214
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,200
I almost had a heart attack.

215
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:46,840
I'm sorry.

216
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,120
I...

217
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,480
I don't...

218
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,320
I gave flowers to make you happy.

219
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,440
But

220
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,080
I almost gave you

221
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,880
two heart attacks within an hour.

222
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,240
I think

223
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,680
it's best if I keep my distance at work.

224
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,120
I'll get back to work.

225
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,240
<i>I'm the one</i>

226
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:28,000
<i>who should be apologizing.</i>

227
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,440
Ms. Liu.

228
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,880
Here's a thank you gift for hiring us.

229
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,480
Thank you very much.

230
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,680
Here's the letter of intent.

231
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:46,760
-Please take a look.
-Sure.

232
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,400
I prefer these two designs.

233
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,800
If you plan to have a baby after marriage,

234
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:56,280
I would personally recommend this design.

235
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:59,200
There's a tatami area behind this bedroom.

236
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,720
It's perfect for children to play here.

237
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,080
Dear, what do you think?

238
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,320
Whatever you like.

239
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:07,480
The rendered photo looks good.

240
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:10,640
I just wonder if the actual outcome
will look the same.

241
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,360
Don't worry.

242
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,760
Our designer will monitor

243
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,920
the renovation progress personally.

244
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,360
Okay. Let me look at it again.

245
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,440
Sure.

246
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
How is it?

247
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,640
Here, I lost the bet.

248
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:42,440
I didn't expect

249
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,680
that Yuan Song's design

250
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,240
is more appealing to women.

251
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:46,480
That's why

252
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,920
you should try to improve.

253
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,160
Don't just stay at home and play games.

254
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:51,760
Gen Z

255
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,680
is already taking over the world.

256
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,040
Meanwhile, the 00's

257
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,520
are rising too.

258
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:57,800
It's not fair.

259
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:00,680
My design was obviously
more logical and practical.

260
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,960
If men had made the decision,

261
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,320
I would've won.

262
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,480
However, in this world,

263
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,080
women have gotten hold
of all decision-making rights.

264
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,480
That's not true.

265
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:11,920
When men say,

266
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,480
"You can decide. It's up to you."

267
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,560
They might seem like pampering women

268
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:17,960
by letting them decide.

269
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,520
But actually,

270
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,200
they just don't care enough about this.

271
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:26,440
Honestly, most men
couldn't be bothered by these things.

272
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,480
That's true.

273
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,440
You guys are better at thinking

274
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,880
about how to not get caught

275
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,680
after cheating on your girlfriend.

276
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:36,680
Why? Are you still angry at that florist?

277
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,720
What do you mean by "you guys"?

278
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,000
I've never cheated.

279
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:42,920
My bad.

280
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,640
You have to get
a girlfriend first for that.

281
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,160
Did you fight again?

282
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:05,599
What's there to fight about?

283
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,040
She wants to talk.

284
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:08,760
She has been sighing all day.

285
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:09,800
And skipped lunch too.

286
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,119
What is she thinking?

287
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:14,920
We're waiting for you.

288
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,319
Sit down.

289
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,400
Is this meeting

290
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:23,720
about my relationship again?

291
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:27,040
Aren't we going to wait for Fanxing?

292
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:29,960
Your sister isn't coming back for dinner.

293
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,520
She's out with her colleagues.

294
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,720
We're having a meeting

295
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,600
because she's not at home.

296
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,560
The topic of today's meeting...

297
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,320
is your sister.

298
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,000
It's not me this time!

299
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,200
What's with Fanxing?

300
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:06,000
I went grocery shopping this morning

301
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,360
and bumped into Mrs. Wang,
who was exercising.

302
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,480
A handsome guy is
grilling meat next to me.

303
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,800
I'm so blessed.

304
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,800
It's my honor to serve beautiful ladies.

305
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,960
Yuan Song,
do you like gentle and big sisters?

306
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,320
Of course.

307
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,680
What do you think about me then?

308
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:31,400
You're pretty, elegant and sexy.

309
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,200
You're the Clubbing Wildcat.

310
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,960
You're a great big sister.

311
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,360
But too bad I'm out of luck.

312
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,160
I have a girlfriend.

313
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,760
I knew it.

314
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,000
Unfortunately? However? But?

315
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,800
The main point always comes later.

316
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:50,840
Okay, I'm not going to scare you anymore.

317
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,000
If it was two years ago,

318
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,800
I might chase after cute boys like you.

319
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:57,080
But I'm already 30.

320
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:59,240
From a Clubbing Wildcat

321
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,080
to a Clubbing Old Cat.

322
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,040
It's time for me

323
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,680
to find someone suitable.

324
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:07,880
Ms. Bai, what are you looking for?

325
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,360
You must have standards.

326
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,280
For me,

327
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:11,600
I want to find...

328
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,240
someone average.

329
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:14,920
"Someone average"?

330
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,560
What kind of standard is that?

331
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,200
We're all average people.

332
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,480
I don't need him to be perfect,

333
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:22,880
but not too awful.

334
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,920
He should have a stable job.

335
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:29,520
As for living standards,
just be similar to most city people.

336
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,200
Also,

337
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,640
average in appearance.

338
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:35,120
His pros and cons must be equal in amount.

339
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:38,120
Amidst the crowd, he'll be overshadowed.

340
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,000
He'll never become

341
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,320
the focus nor be envied by others.

342
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,720
Normal,

343
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,720
busy,

344
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:48,000
and beyond common.

345
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,600
That's so boring!

346
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:51,840
Boring?

347
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,200
What about you then?

348
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,680
I like him

349
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:58,640
and

350
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,480
my mom has to like him too.

351
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,720
Are you looking for you or your mom?

352
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:04,880
You're already 20 years old!

353
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:05,840
It's time to grow up.

354
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,360
I'll try my best.

355
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,640
What about you, Ms. He?

356
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,720
Me?

357
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,920
I don't have specific demands.
Normal will do.

358
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,720
Slightly better looking.

359
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,080
A good personality, talented.

360
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:27,840
A harmonious family.

361
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,600
Doesn't smoke nor drink.

362
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,640
No bad habits, that's all.

363
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,920
I just realized that

364
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:38,000
the antonym of "average" is "normal".

365
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,160
Ms. He.

366
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:44,240
This is the real reason
why you are single for 32 years.

367
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,280
Aren't you going

368
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,080
to lower your standards

369
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,320
for a normal person?

370
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,760
I've stood by it for so many years.

371
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:55,520
Why should I lower my standards
and deny my past easily?

372
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,480
Isn't life all about being content?

373
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,040
And also, being persistent.

374
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:02,360
Fine. Idol. You're my idol!

375
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,440
Come, drink up.

376
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,360
Ms. He is so cool. My idol too.

377
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:06,960
-Cheers!
-To our idol!

378
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,640
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

379
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,520
Impossible!

380
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,240
Just because Fanxing has a boyfriend.

381
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,280
You're assuming that

382
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,960
the guy is already married.

383
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,480
A few days ago, she told me

384
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,520
someone wanted to date her.

385
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,440
But this person told her

386
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,600
to keep it a secret
from her family and friends.

387
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,200
She asked for my opinion.

388
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,440
Keep it a secret?

389
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,680
They're just dating. Why keep it a secret?

390
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:36,760
That's right.

391
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,920
Since Mrs. Wang told me about it,

392
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,720
I've been really worried.

393
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,400
I thought,

394
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:44,480
"This is bad."

395
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,120
Something's about to happen.

396
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,120
That's true.

397
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,520
Fanxing puts on makeup
even when walking the dog.

398
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,120
Something's wrong.

399
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,600
Oh, no.

400
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:55,880
This is bad.

401
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,800
It's all your fault!

402
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,520
You always go on and on
in front of the kids.

403
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,560
"This niece got married.

404
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,360
That niece got married."

405
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,520
Everyone's married.

406
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,680
Can you imagine

407
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,760
how you've been stressing her out?

408
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,520
What stress did I give her?

409
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,080
I just said it casually.

410
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,240
I'm not like the mothers on TV,

411
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:19,120
who force their kids to get married.
Did I force her?

412
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,680
You casually say it today
and again tomorrow!

413
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:22,920
Always saying so casually!

414
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,920
Do you think it won't affect them?

415
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:27,120
-It's for their own good!
-For their own good?

416
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,680
Their happiness is what's most important!

417
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,920
Just like the holly trees by the roadside.

418
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,760
They're trimmed to look the same!

419
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,440
-Do they look interesting?
-They do!

420
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:38,600
But...

421
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,680
But we can't do that to the kids.

422
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:45,680
We can't trim them
and make them lose their personality.

423
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:47,640
You already told me.

424
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,080
I know now.

425
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:50,720
That's right.

426
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,560
Okay, let me analyze this.

427
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:53,800
Basically,

428
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,320
Fanxing

429
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,560
has found a potential partner.

430
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:58,960
They're still flirting

431
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:01,480
and are not officially together,
so she didn't tell us.

432
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:03,760
I hope that's the case.

433
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:04,960
But

434
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,560
it's weird to be keeping it a secret.

435
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,920
Mom isn't wrong.

436
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,800
Someone like Fanxing,

437
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:12,920
who has never dated,

438
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,400
yet has high expectations
for her first love,

439
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,120
can be easily misled.

440
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,080
Being rational is one thing.

441
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:20,680
But dating

442
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:23,760
will make you lose
your rationality and personality.

443
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,200
That's right!

444
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,560
I have a say in this.
I've been through this.

445
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,120
Back then, I wasn't thinking straight

446
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,720
and I insisted to marry your dad.

447
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:35,120
I've been listening
to his nagging ever since.

448
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:39,480
You chased after me, okay?

449
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:41,360
You even sneaked me a handkerchief.

450
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,240
That's why I said

451
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,800
I wasn't thinking straight.

452
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:51,480
What's the point of guessing?

453
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:53,800
Let's wait for her and ask her directly.

454
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,920
Your sister is different from you.

455
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,360
You're basically just

456
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:00,800
ungrateful.

457
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,720
Your sister is stubborn.

458
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,520
If she's decided,

459
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,800
she'd definitely...

460
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,040
If she's really dating,

461
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,640
that's great.

462
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:14,480
But if she likes someone who's married,

463
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,000
that's awful!

464
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,600
She's prideful
and doesn't confide in anyone!

465
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,480
If relatives ask her about it,

466
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,760
won't she hang herself out of frustration?

467
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,520
Touch wood! Don't say that.

468
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,080
Who's hanging herself?

469
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,720
It's Fanxing we're talking about.

470
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,000
If it was Canyang,

471
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:32,080
we can just break his legs.

472
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:35,240
Yes. Break his legs.

473
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,120
I want a DNA test.

474
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:45,360
I've always felt
like I was picked from the trash.

475
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:48,840
I'm famished.

476
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Is the meat done?

477
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,520
Better on time than early. Just in time.

478
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:53,680
Cong Xiao, here.

479
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:54,800
Chang Huan, here!

480
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,200
I'll sit here, then.

481
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:04,280
It's room temperature.
Is there a cold one?

482
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,000
I think so. I'll ask the waiter.

483
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,120
Waiter!

484
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,000
One cold beer, please!

485
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,880
-Coming!
-Thanks for your hard work.

486
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,640
I'm so curious!

487
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:16,280
I heard that the sales manager
of Aijia tried to snatch our client

488
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,400
and got shamed by our Ms. Cong!

489
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,160
What happened?

490
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,080
I have to admit,

491
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:24,200
Ms. Cong really made us proud this time.

492
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,680
You weren't there to see their faces.

493
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,400
It was plain to see

494
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,800
they looked down on us.

495
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:33,120
The manager tried
to snatch our client but failed.

496
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,320
They must be furious.

497
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,600
It was nothing.

498
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,280
We're not strong.

499
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:40,320
They're just too weak.

500
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,440
Cong Xiao!

501
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:44,040
-Here.
-Here! Drink up!

502
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:47,080
In honor of Cong Xiao!

503
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,480
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

504
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,520
Since you're so curious,
why won't you just ask her?

505
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:52,520
What do you want?

506
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,040
In this case,

507
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,360
I think we have to start internally.

508
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,200
We must untie the knot in her heart.

509
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:01,400
Let her know that

510
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,720
it's okay to not get married.

511
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:06,400
The whole family supports her.

512
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,080
I'm at fault for this too.

513
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,240
I should reflect on myself.

514
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,240
You have to self-reflect.

515
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:21,440
Also, you have
to strengthen her core belief.

516
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,120
I have a core belief.

517
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:27,280
Even if

518
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,680
the whole world is against you,

519
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:32,080
Mom will always love you,

520
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:33,640
support you,

521
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,360
and always be by your side.

522
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:38,400
I will cheer you on!

523
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,480
Yes. Let's change some words.

524
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:43,800
Change the whole world to all of China

525
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,200
and add her dad too.

526
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:51,200
Do you know that there's a mental disorder

527
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:55,200
among kids in eighth grade
called eighth-grader syndrome?

528
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:58,120
I didn't know that old people
would get it too.

529
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:00,840
Eighth-grader syndrome?

530
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,240
Who are you calling crazy?

531
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,440
You're crazy!

532
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:08,120
Call your sister now!

533
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:11,600
She's always going out
with her colleagues.

534
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,920
Do her colleagues not have parents
and they don't have to go home?

535
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:16,040
I doubt so!

536
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:16,960
Call her!

537
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,520
The spy contacted us.

538
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,240
Thank you for the meal, Ms. He!

539
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:31,400
-Thank you, Ms. He!
-You're welcome.

540
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,440
I'm so full.

541
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:34,560
Me too.

542
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:35,960
It's only ten o'clock.

543
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,320
I don't want to go home.

544
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,880
Let's go for round two!

545
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:42,000
-Where to?
-I got it all planned out.

546
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:44,320
I booked a room for karaoke next door!

547
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,760
Awesome!

548
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:48,240
Bai, you understand me so well!

549
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,800
I don't want to go home. Home is cold.

550
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,560
My toilet is leaking too.

551
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:53,920
Me neither!

552
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,600
When I go home,
my mom monitors me like a dog.

553
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,160
I want to be that dog.

554
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,080
-Dog?
-Thank you.

555
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,040
What dog?

556
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,720
Single dog?

557
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,000
I'm already one.

558
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,360
-Cheers to single dogs!
-Let's go!

559
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:07,640
Let's go karaoke!

560
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,320
Let's go sing.

561
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,760
Singing time!

562
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,200
Your phone!

563
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:14,680
-Don't leave anything behind.
-Don't forget.

564
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:21,560
-I don't want to sing.
-Learn this!

565
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:24,600
<i>We are going to the Eiffel Tower</i>

566
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,440
<i>We are going to</i>

567
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:27,960
<i>The Eiffel Tower</i>

568
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:31,560
<i>Apologize.</i>

569
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,000
<i>Apologize.</i>

570
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:34,960
<i>Apologize!</i>

571
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:41,840
Hello?

572
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:45,640
What's wrong?

573
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,120
Your dad has a headache.

574
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:50,160
There's no medicine at home.

575
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:53,120
It's almost ten o'clock.

576
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:54,760
Are you done yet?

577
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:57,320
If you're on your way home,

578
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,440
buy some medicine for your dad.

579
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:01,520
Okay, I'll go home now.

580
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:06,200
Mom.

581
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:09,040
It's normal to sing
with colleagues after a meal.

582
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,240
No way.

583
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,280
It's too late.

584
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,200
I'm worried.

585
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,200
Don't tell your sister.

586
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:16,880
I have my strategy.

587
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:19,320
So your strategy is for Dad to act sick.

588
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,280
Dad, did you agree to this?

589
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:24,360
Desperate times
call for desperate measures.

590
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,120
Let's go home.

591
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,680
Let's wait for our daughter.

592
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,520
Sleep early. Don't watch soccer all night.

593
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:31,440
Okay.

594
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:32,880
Don't tell her!

595
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,720
Hey, wait up.

596
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:44,080
Something came up at home.
I have to go now.

597
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,320
Bai.

598
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:49,120
Get the receipt
and claim it from me tomorrow.

599
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:50,480
Okay.

600
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:13,600
What a buzzkill.

601
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,400
-Let's go sing.
-Okay!

602
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:18,320
Let's go sing.

603
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:20,120
Let's go.

604
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:29,480
<i>Don't think I don't know
That you sneaked out to see her</i>

605
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:31,840
<i>Don't ask me why</i>

606
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,480
<i>I see it in your eyes</i>

607
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,480
<i>This is my last warning</i>

608
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,600
<i>If you keep doing this</i>

609
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,760
<i>Get lost with your mistress</i>

610
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,120
<i>Get out of my sight</i>

611
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:45,280
<i>What's wrong, my dear?</i>

612
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:46,600
<i>No need to fawn me!</i>

613
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:49,680
<i>I just went for some coffee</i>

614
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:50,720
<i>Nonsense</i>

615
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,800
<i>You don't pick up my calls
And yet you're angry</i>

616
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,000
<i>I'll see how you fare</i>

617
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:58,040
<i>Don't you start a fight again</i>

618
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:01,360
<i>I want to show you
How I miss you every day</i>

619
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:04,920
<i>Sending you my postcard of love</i>

620
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,320
-What happened between you and Fanxing?
-What?

621
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,800
Aren't both of you close?

622
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,680
But you didn't even talk at dinner.

623
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,080
Was it that obvious?

624
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:17,120
It wasn't her fault.

625
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:19,080
I'm just jealous.

626
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,440
My senior

627
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:26,840
introduced her distant cousin to me.

628
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:28,440
But at that time,

629
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,600
I was doing well with that florist jerk.

630
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,600
So I introduced that blind date

631
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:37,240
to Ms. He instead.

632
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:40,800
I wanted her to find happiness too.

633
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,600
But I didn't expect

634
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:46,440
that he would be my type!

635
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,440
Since you like him,

636
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:50,680
just ask your senior to set you up again.

637
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:52,200
Their blind date failed.

638
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,960
If it failed, would I be jealous?

639
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:57,320
It's obvious that she has a boyfriend.

640
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:02,080
She's basically telling the world
that she's dating.

641
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,720
Others may not see it.

642
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:06,000
But how can I not see it?

643
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,400
Furthermore,

644
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:09,320
Chang Huan and I saw them

645
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,760
on a date at the mall.

646
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,680
They even bought ice cream.

647
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:16,640
They looked good together.

648
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,280
How dare you!

649
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,520
Why did you throw it at me?

650
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:22,600
A gentleman uses words, not fists.

651
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:05,840
Did you really not notice

652
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,320
any male colleagues close to He Fanxing?

653
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:10,080
He must be an outsider then.

654
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:11,720
Anyway, just monitor her.

655
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:13,640
Ms. He is my boss.

656
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:16,040
It feels wrong for me to monitor her.

657
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,120
How so?

658
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,240
All is fair in love and war.

659
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,920
She dresses up so glamorously every day.

660
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:23,520
If they're not dating,
they must be flirting.

661
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:26,040
She's in her thirties,
not a high school student.

662
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:27,320
Are you kidding me?

663
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:28,960
They can't be compared.

664
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,480
Even students have exes.

665
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:32,880
Anyway, just monitor her.

666
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:34,840
Find out who she's with after work.

667
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,480
Perfect.

668
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:39,840
I'd like to know too.

669
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,080
Wait!

670
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,440
How is it?

671
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,680
What breakfast is this?

672
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,000
There's so much food!

673
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:09,760
So you can eat anything you want.

674
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,920
You have a long day ahead.

675
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,600
Yes, it must be tiring to go to work.

676
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,080
You should eat more.

677
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:22,280
You love the fried breadsticks

678
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:24,480
and steamed buns
at our neighborhood's entrance.

679
00:34:25,239 --> 00:34:28,280
Your dad woke up early
to buy them for you. Here.

680
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:33,120
Yes.

681
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:34,639
This too.

682
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:37,000
Have some fruit. Get some vitamins.

683
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:38,639
-Here.
-I'll eat it myself.

684
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:41,400
Dad. Mom.

685
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,280
What has gotten into you two?

686
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:44,920
I'm not a three-year-old kid.

687
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:49,520
Whether you're 3 or 80 years old,

688
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:52,600
you'll always be a baby

689
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,239
to your dad and I.

690
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,280
If we can live that long.

691
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:04,040
Shen Hongmei.

692
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,840
Are you Shen Hongmei from Shen Residence?

693
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,520
The village with a huge parasol tree?

694
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:12,040
-Name the second son of the chief!
-Ergui!

695
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:14,400
Cut it out.

696
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,040
Do you think that

697
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,560
your mom is possessed?

698
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,080
Come on.

699
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:21,440
Sit down.

700
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,440
Hurry.

701
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:24,280
As long as you're fine.

702
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:25,760
Eat up.

703
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,200
Your mom is trying to say

704
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:30,440
that she thinks

705
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,760
she hasn't been treating you right.

706
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,680
Always talking about

707
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:38,160
people getting married in front of you
and giving you stress.

708
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:41,360
So, she's using her own method

709
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,160
to apologize to you.

710
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:44,600
Am I right?

711
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:46,880
Yes.

712
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:49,480
Nonsense.

713
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,240
Look, Xingxing.

714
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,840
When I'm at home,

715
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:59,560
I can't do anything else.

716
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,040
I can only cook.

717
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:03,880
In fact, I'm just assisting your dad.

718
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:06,800
Actually,

719
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:10,080
you only nagged me about getting married.

720
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,040
And I know it's for my good.

721
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,320
But I always

722
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:18,440
make you feel bad in front
of the women in the community instead.

723
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:20,000
They say nasty things to you.

724
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:21,760
But you never complain.

725
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:26,560
Let alone you, Dad.

726
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:28,800
You always support me.

727
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:35,360
I'm really blessed

728
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,520
to have parents like you.

729
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:41,560
What's so nasty?

730
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:42,960
They're just

731
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:44,520
gossiping behind our back.

732
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:46,520
I'll gossip about them too.

733
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,080
Gossip about them?

734
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
There's no need to try to win them.

735
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,280
Can you not?

736
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:53,200
No way.

737
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:56,280
If I don't, we'll lose.

738
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,240
You're a high school graduate.

739
00:36:58,520 --> 00:36:59,840
Where are your moralities?

740
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,360
You're a university graduate.

741
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,920
I'm just a high school graduate.

742
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:07,480
Of course, my morals are less than yours.

743
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,680
Are you trying to pick a fight?

744
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:17,520
Let's eat.

745
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:18,520
Eat up.

746
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:19,800
Let's eat.

747
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,440
Xingxing loves this.

748
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:23,920
Yes, this too.

749
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,480
This too. Here.

750
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:37,960
Love Charm!

751
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:40,720
What are you doing?

752
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,400
I didn't want to do this.

753
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,520
You made me do it!

754
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:23,760
STOREROOM

755
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:25,440
Ms. He.

756
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:29,680
What is it?

757
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,880
Admit your crime.

758
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,240
What do you mean?

759
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:40,720
About the blind date.

760
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:43,480
Was I not clear enough?

761
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:45,360
You told me that

762
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,760
you apologized to him.

763
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:49,880
But Chang Huan and Xiao
saw you two on a date.

764
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:51,880
A date?

765
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,680
Who would date someone they had just met?

766
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:59,200
Let me help you recall.

767
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:00,880
At the mall.

768
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:03,640
A meal together and ice cream too.

769
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,880
It's still not a date.

770
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,520
So you're admitting that

771
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,440
you were seeing
another man behind my back.

772
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:15,560
When colleagues

773
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:19,360
see a guy and a woman together
during non-working hours,

774
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:21,400
they'll assume that they are a couple.

775
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:25,440
Do you know how many people thought
Canyang was my boyfriend?

776
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:27,520
They'd say,

777
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,560
"You two look like husband and wife!"

778
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,240
We have the same mom,
of course we look the same.

779
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:35,480
Anyway,

780
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,640
I wasn't hiding anything from you.

781
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,760
I just thought I didn't need to tell you.

782
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:46,760
What do you mean?

783
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,520
"Didn't need to tell me"?

784
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:51,240
Or do you think

785
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:53,480
that my feelings are trivial?

786
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,080
Don't misunderstand me.

787
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:01,040
What I meant was...

788
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:02,720
Ms. He.

789
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:05,560
Are you giving a lecture?

790
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:10,440
No, just chatting.

791
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,280
What's the matter?

792
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,200
We have a new client

793
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,600
asking for Yuan Song.

794
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:19,840
Then...

795
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:27,840
What a tough team to manage.

796
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:29,840
Gen Z nowadays

797
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,520
are so full of personality.

798
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:33,880
Ms. He.

799
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:36,800
Try not to be too strict with him.

800
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:38,920
He's very talented.

801
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:40,240
After his graduation,

802
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:43,200
he wouldn't want to stay
in our small company.

803
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:45,120
Just turn a blind eye.

804
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:49,400
Did our boss pay me to turn a blind eye?

805
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:52,600
It's hard enough as it is. If I slack off,

806
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:54,760
let's just all quit. You can go home.

807
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,640
<i>I misspoke again.</i>

808
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:16,240
Who's calling?

809
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:26,080
Hello?

810
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:28,000
<i>Fanxing, are you free at noon?</i>

811
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:29,160
<i>Can you help me?</i>

812
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,800
You're the cutest.

813
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:52,360
Sorry, I'm late.

814
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:54,960
The surgery is set at 1 p.m.

815
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,840
A client called to visit suddenly.

816
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,120
I have to return to the office.

817
00:41:58,320 --> 00:41:59,160
Sorry to bother you.

818
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:01,320
Just leave it to me. Don't worry.

819
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,520
Love Charm, obey your godmother!

820
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:08,880
When did I become your godmother?

821
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:13,480
It's okay.

822
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:15,680
You're the best, Doudou.

823
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:17,360
I'm here.

824
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:19,880
Look, there's a big brother here.

825
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,640
Right? Big brother.

826
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:24,320
Play with big brother
and it won't hurt anymore.

827
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:26,280
Be good.

828
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:28,880
Doudou really likes your kid.
What is its name?

829
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:31,280
It's Love Charm.

830
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:33,840
Love Charm?

831
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:37,280
That's interesting. What's wrong with it?

832
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:39,440
Nothing, it's getting neutered.

833
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:41,360
Neuter?

834
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:44,480
How can you neuter it? It's so young!

835
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:47,480
It's already over one year old.

836
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:49,320
It's perfect for neutering.

837
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:51,040
That's human thinking.

838
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:52,840
Did you think about its feelings?

839
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:55,360
If you love it, you mustn't hurt it.

840
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:56,760
Think about it.

841
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:58,680
Would you want to be neutered?

842
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:01,000
What kind of mother are you?

843
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:03,480
In this case,

844
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:06,440
I don't think we can think
in their perspective.

845
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:08,640
Humans are just evil.

846
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:10,680
Everything is for our own interest!

847
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:14,720
Aren't you going to reconsider it?

848
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:17,320
Poor thing. Doesn't it bother you?

849
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:23,160
I'm talking to you!

850
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:25,120
Aren't you being rude?

851
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:26,920
Excuse me, miss.

852
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:29,200
Are you ordering me not to neuter my dog

853
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,720
or are you suggesting to me
not to neuter my dog?

854
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,560
I'm suggesting, of course!

855
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:35,400
-I was kind--
-Thank you, but no.

856
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:36,600
You...

857
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:37,760
Hey.

858
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:39,080
Control your kids!

859
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:44,480
Call the police!

860
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:45,480
