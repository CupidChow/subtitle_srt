1
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,080
<i>Right now,</i>

2
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:09,080
<i>I'm just like those prawns
bubbling away in the pot.</i>

3
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:16,880
Fanxing.

4
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,520
What kind of girl
do you think Yuan Song likes?

5
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,360
He's right there.

6
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,440
Why are you asking me?

7
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,160
It depends on feelings.

8
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,320
That's a general response.

9
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,360
You're not being serious. Try again.

10
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,160
I prefer a contrast
between personality and looks.

11
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,640
Someone who is tough and fiercely cute.

12
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,520
It would be perfect
if we could drink together.

13
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,240
Aren't you basically describing me?

14
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,920
Unfortunately, no.

15
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,360
What a hypocrite.

16
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,760
Fanxing.

17
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:58,240
Don't you think that Yuan Song and I
make a great pair?

18
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,240
Not really.

19
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,120
I think he's not good enough for you.

20
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,160
Did you hear that, Yuan Song?

21
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,640
I'm a catch, so you need
to work harder to court me.

22
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,240
I will consider you.

23
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,480
Thank you, but save it.

24
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,400
It's almost time.

25
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,760
The talk will start in half an hour.
We should go.

26
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,520
What about you, He Fanxing?

27
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,280
Why don't I go with you?

28
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,720
I don't have plans anyway.

29
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Have you registered?

30
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,320
What?

31
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,040
You need to make a reservation
for an invitation to the talk.

32
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,440
Then...

33
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,320
I was thinking of praying
at Chongyuan Temple.

34
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,600
I'll enjoy the hot spring after.

35
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,560
It's perfect. You two go ahead.

36
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,520
Enjoy yourself.

37
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,680
Don't get lost.

38
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,640
Don't talk to strangers.

39
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,640
Safety first.

40
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,360
Remember how to get back.

41
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,280
Text or call me if there's anything.

42
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,880
All right, admission is prohibited
ten minutes prior to the talk.

43
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:05,840
Let's go.

44
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:22,520
<i>I have met a completely
aggressive opponent.</i>

45
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,320
Why are you back so soon?

46
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,120
Why didn't you answer my calls?

47
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,440
I can't take my phone to the hot spring.

48
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,840
Weren't you supposed to go to pray?

49
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,200
I thought something happened.

50
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,840
What could have happened?

51
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,000
Forget it.

52
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,520
What are you doing?

53
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,440
I have something to tell you.

54
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,040
Go on.

55
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,080
Last night, you said

56
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,640
that I called and proposed to you
while I was drunk.

57
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,960
I have thought it through.

58
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,840
I've been eager to get married

59
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,760
since my dad fell sick.

60
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,440
So when you said
I proposed to you while I was drunk,

61
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,680
I don't think you lied to me.

62
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,880
So what's your answer?

63
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,080
What answer?

64
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,840
I wasn't lying either!

65
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,480
I have talked to Ye Luming
to end our relationship.

66
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,160
The reason is simple.

67
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,560
I just couldn't develop feelings for him.

68
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,320
It's because...

69
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,400
The one I truly love...

70
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,240
has always been you.

71
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,120
So are you proposing

72
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:16,800
or confessing to me?

73
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,800
Both!

74
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:23,040
So what's your answer?

75
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,560
Of course, it's...

76
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:31,880
No.

77
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,600
-To both?
-To both.

78
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,680
You can't say no.

79
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:37,840
Pick one.

80
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:44,520
Why do I suddenly feel a great sense
of déjà vu right now?

81
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,160
But it was different.

82
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,760
The one who said no was you.

83
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,240
-Say yes.
-No.

84
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,480
No?

85
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:00,360
I've heard your feelings loud and clear.

86
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,920
You and Ye Luming didn't work out,
so you came to make me say yes.

87
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,240
Am I a guy you can summon as you wish?

88
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,360
Do I look that easy to you?

89
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,200
You're making me annoyed.

90
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,240
That's not it.

91
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:25,120
It was my fault.

92
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,160
I apologize.

93
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,800
You're good at apologizing

94
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,440
and making mistakes too.

95
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:31,800
I...

96
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:35,880
I'll reflect on myself.

97
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:43,000
I've been trying so hard
to stop myself from disturbing you.

98
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:47,280
Can you accept the consequences
of being with me again?

99
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,960
I want a lasting
and stable relationship too.

100
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,360
I mean

101
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,600
I don't want to be hidden away.

102
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,240
If we get back together,
it will be public.

103
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,320
Of course.

104
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,880
I've taken care of that.

105
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,720
My parents know that
I came here to find you.

106
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,240
This time,

107
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:11,280
I'm not going to do it half-heartedly.

108
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,160
I don't want to back down anymore.

109
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,520
I'm already in my 30s.

110
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,440
I can't be a coward

111
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:22,200
who is afraid of facing my own feelings
and responsibilities.

112
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,440
I neglected the present
because I was worried about the future.

113
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,880
I put in so much effort into work and life

114
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,360
just because I wish to be happy.

115
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,520
It's not only for survival.

116
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:38,960
I know

117
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,760
that I'm quite a loser.

118
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,160
I'm becoming more immature as I age.

119
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,040
Stop putting yourself down.

120
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,320
That will only make
your admirer feel small.

121
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,960
It's as if he has bad taste.

122
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,080
So can we get back together?

123
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,440
No.

124
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,840
Still a no?

125
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,480
I have to consider it.

126
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,720
You do have a prior record.

127
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,320
He's obviously playing hard to get.

128
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,240
<i>I know he is.</i>

129
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,960
<i>But I don't get why he has to do that.</i>

130
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,680
Maybe it's because
he was the aggressive one before.

131
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,200
Humans are insecure creatures.

132
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,960
Do you think all men are tough?

133
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:38,080
He probably wants to see
how far you're willing to go for him.

134
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:40,720
Okay.

135
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,760
Hey, that's all for now.

136
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,040
I need to settle my problems.
I'm hanging up.

137
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,880
Goodness.

138
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,280
Our heartless little girl actually sighed.

139
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,120
In the past,

140
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:04,400
I didn't get why adults
get angry so easily.

141
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:06,560
Now,

142
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,920
even I have started to sigh.

143
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,560
Don't sigh.

144
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,880
That's three seconds off your life.

145
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:22,000
If only I didn't like you.

146
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,360
What?

147
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:27,880
My uncle said it.

148
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,800
His matters and mine are unrelated.

149
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,320
He is still good friends with Fanxing.

150
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,520
But...

151
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,720
I still feel sorry towards my uncle.

152
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,040
I understand.

153
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,040
Our little girl has grown up.

154
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,200
What is this?

155
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,120
This is why I broke up with you.

156
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,800
ULTRASOUND EXAMINATION REPORT

157
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,680
You're finally telling me.

158
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,120
I SAW SONG XUE DURING MY CHECKUP.
SO SHE'S MARRIED!

159
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,440
We have been together for over a decade.

160
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,080
I thought we knew each other very well.

161
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,080
But you acted on your own.

162
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,360
It's my own decision to keep the baby.

163
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:05,040
I can't force you to accept it.

164
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,640
In the future, if you want,

165
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,600
you can see him.

166
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,080
It's you who wants the baby.

167
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,320
Why should I see him?

168
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,480
You've made the decision.

169
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:17,840
The baby is yours.

170
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,320
It's your future.

171
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,040
It's your hardship.

172
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,000
You're independent.

173
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,440
I suppose I should applaud you.

174
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,000
What do you expect me to do?

175
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,440
This was an accident.

176
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,120
If it wasn't for this,
I would probably never have a child!

177
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,680
He already exists.

178
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:41,080
-I can't bring myself to kill him!
-Right!

179
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:43,760
You can't.

180
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,360
But I can.

181
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,360
I'm selfish. I only care about myself.

182
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,480
Isn't that what you think of me?

183
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,880
I never said that you were selfish.

184
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:56,120
Everyone has the right
to choose their own path.

185
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,160
-Even you--
-Sure.

186
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,560
Live by yourself then.

187
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,000
Dear.

188
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,520
You're still up.

189
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:49,880
Where's Malty?

190
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,120
He's sleeping.

191
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,040
Right.

192
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,360
Next month, the company
is organizing a trip abroad.

193
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,520
Family is allowed.

194
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,480
We haven't had the chance to travel.

195
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,440
Let's have my parents look after the kids,

196
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,200
while we...

197
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,640
go and have some fun.

198
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,040
Can you take a day off tomorrow?

199
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:29,720
Take a day off?

200
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,840
I read about a restaurant online.

201
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,440
They said the food is quite delicious.

202
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,000
I haven't eaten out in a while.

203
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:41,960
Sure.

204
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,240
Let's go on a date tomorrow.

205
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:45,800
You should get some fresh air

206
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,920
or you will fall sick
from looking after the kids at home.

207
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,400
I'll take a shower.

208
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:32,840
You're early.

209
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,520
What's your decision
about us getting back together?

210
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,280
Is it necessary for you to rush it?

211
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:40,840
Yes.

212
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,080
Next year,

213
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,400
I'll be going to Sweden
to study for two years.

214
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,840
-There's a seven-hour time difference.
-I know.

215
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,520
It's okay.

216
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,960
I'm good at long-distance relationships.

217
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,000
Besides, I can visit you often.

218
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,360
That's true.

219
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,360
But I can't be selfish.

220
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,920
I have to be responsible for your life.

221
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,000
Why should you be?

222
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,080
You don't have to.
I can be responsible for myself.

223
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,160
You're being too impulsive.

224
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:11,280
That's why you think
you can't live without me.

225
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,960
You will regret and hate me
for wasting your time.

226
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,000
I'm not acting on impulse.

227
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,600
I have made up my mind.

228
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:21,320
I know more than ever of what I want now.

229
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,520
If I don't take the chance now

230
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,120
and worry about the future like a coward,

231
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,400
I will regret it then.

232
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,920
Nobody knows
what the future holds after all.

233
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,720
But your dad is sick.

234
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,240
I'm sure he wants you
to marry a suitable man soon.

235
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,360
Yes, I've tried.

236
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,600
But getting married
just for the sake of it

237
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,840
is not something I can live with.

238
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,000
My dad wants me to be happy,

239
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,320
not just to be married.

240
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:55,920
Marriage is just one of the ways
to reach happiness.

241
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,520
It's not the only way.

242
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:58,960
Besides,

243
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:01,760
those who believe
that marriage is the happy ending

244
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,440
have been brainwashed by fairy tales.

245
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:07,960
I think that getting married
is just the beginning of a new chapter.

246
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:11,120
As to how it ends, that's another mystery.

247
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:14,120
I get it.

248
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:15,600
But...

249
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,720
Do you really like me that much?

250
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:20,880
Yes!

251
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:26,800
You are the only guy I have met

252
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,200
who doesn't care

253
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,160
about how many family members I have,

254
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,480
my annual income,

255
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,000
how many kids I want,

256
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,920
or who should be the one
to do the housework.

257
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:37,920
You're just...

258
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:41,400
You're just someone who likes me.

259
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,600
Is that all?

260
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,240
That's not all!

261
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,080
You're energetic.

262
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,600
You're ambitious and kind.

263
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,520
You have many more good traits,

264
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,800
so many that you're glowing.

265
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,760
So it has to be me?

266
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:01,400
It has to be you.

267
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,440
All right.

268
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:06,800
Do you have a lipstick?

269
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,160
Here.

270
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:14,680
Hand.

271
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,440
What are you doing?

272
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,240
Hold this.

273
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:31,920
What's that?

274
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,240
A slave agreement.

275
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,560
Let me see.

276
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,760
You've already stamped it,
so there's no backing out.

277
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:39,920
No, wait a second.
What's that? Let me see!

278
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,920
No-casual-break-up contract.

279
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,280
What contract?

280
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,720
And I like your answer.

281
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,760
You get full marks. Don't get too cocky.

282
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,200
Were you messing with me?

283
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:50,720
Who's messing with you?

284
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:54,320
It was you who wanted to break up
out of responsibility for me.

285
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,120
Why? Can't seem to hold your ground?

286
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,480
You're mean!

287
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,440
Give me that! Let me see!

288
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:03,280
-You can't hold your ground, can you?
-Just let me see!

289
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,200
Congratulations.

290
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,200
I guess I don't have a chance.

291
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,240
You never stood a chance.

292
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,080
You're so heartless.

293
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:37,280
I had put up a good show for you.

294
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,200
Show?

295
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:42,880
That's right.

296
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,480
But your expression looks better
than Yangcheng Lake now.

297
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:47,880
I'm going to the hot spring.

298
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:53,120
Right, I know you two are newlyweds,

299
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:55,200
but my room is next to Yuan Song's.

300
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,200
I'm not sure about
the soundproof insulation.

301
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,920
Please be mindful, okay?

302
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,680
That's enough from you.

303
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:09,800
What a pity.

304
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,320
I did quite like Yuan Song.

305
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:15,480
It's okay.

306
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:17,360
There are other opportunities out there.

307
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,960
If...

308
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:40,120
I didn't come to look for you,

309
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,560
what would have happened to us?

310
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,360
What else?

311
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,120
You would still get me in two days.

312
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,960
Someone called me late at night

313
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,520
and threatened me.

314
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,320
Is it me?

315
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,040
Did I threaten you?

316
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,120
Yes.

317
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,520
HE FANXING

318
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,400
-Hello?
-Hey.

319
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:19,160
Yuan Song.

320
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,440
I'm He Fanxing.

321
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,640
I know from your caller ID.

322
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,320
Are you drunk?

323
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,120
No!

324
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,240
I feel

325
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:34,680
pretty good.

326
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:36,960
What's the matter?

327
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:42,560
There's a big problem.

328
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,480
Is it related to me?

329
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:46,680
Yes!

330
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,840
It's all because of you.

331
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,560
Me?

332
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,720
I broke up!

333
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,840
<i>It's all because of you.</i>

334
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,880
<i>It's all because of you!</i>

335
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:06,040
You keep showing up in front of me,

336
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,280
<i>day in and day out.</i>

337
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,520
Then you told me that you liked me

338
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,880
and smiled at me.

339
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:17,200
<i>Why are you always smiling at me?</i>

340
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,160
When I saw that,

341
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:26,040
I thought there was no way
I could fall for anyone else.

342
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,240
So what if you like me?

343
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,320
You dated another guy.

344
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:34,520
That...

345
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,560
That's because

346
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:39,240
I wanted to give it a try.

347
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,400
After I tried it,

348
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,640
I realized it wouldn't work.

349
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:48,760
Of course not.

350
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:52,200
Then...

351
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,520
Do you still like me?

352
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,320
Go to bed.

353
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:02,480
We'll talk tomorrow.

354
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,080
<i>I'd rather not talk to a drunkard.</i>

355
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,480
No!

356
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,000
<i>I won't hang up!</i>

357
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,280
You must be lying to me!

358
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:12,760
Why would I lie?

359
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,400
If I hang up,

360
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:19,720
you will surely go and look for...

361
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,080
that female colleague!

362
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,560
Luo Wenyue!

363
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:26,040
<i>She's young</i>

364
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:28,200
<i>and pretty.</i>

365
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,440
And she's very handsy with you.

366
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,160
Very handsy.

367
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:38,680
That girl.

368
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:42,240
She's really good at bowling.

369
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,400
She's very skillful.

370
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,240
I saw her play.

371
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:46,720
Don't teach her!

372
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,200
I'll think about it.

373
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:54,600
Then

374
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:58,840
please consider me.

375
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,400
Please...

376
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,960
get back together with me.

377
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,600
<i>I have always,</i>

378
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,280
always,

379
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,040
always and always,

380
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:18,080
been in love with you.

381
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,400
I can't hold it in anymore.

382
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,120
<i>It's too hard.</i>

383
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,160
What did you say? I didn't catch you.

384
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,240
I said...

385
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:34,520
I can't hold it in anymore!

386
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,080
Keep it down.

387
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:38,960
Your parents will hear you.

388
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,760
Don't hang up the phone then.

389
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,320
I won't.

390
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:48,840
Really?

391
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,760
I can't lose touch with you.

392
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,120
You won't.

393
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:59,120
Today, I was at Ye Luming's house.

394
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:01,200
I ate

395
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,000
a really, really huge piece of steak.

396
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:09,720
I also had some really nice wine.

397
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:14,040
And so, the two of us became good friends.

398
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,520
Goodness.

399
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,760
How embarrassing!

400
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:25,120
It's okay. I like you like that.

401
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,080
Right now,

402
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,120
right at this moment,

403
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:42,040
this is the happiest scene
that I could ever imagine.

404
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,520
It isn't the happiest yet.

405
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:46,840
In the future,

406
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,800
I'm going to build you an enormous house.

407
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,960
Then I'm going to take Baylor with me.

408
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,320
I want a lot of cats.

409
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:58,640
And two parrots.

410
00:25:59,120 --> 00:25:59,960
Okay.

411
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:02,240
You care for the pets
and I'll care for you.

412
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:08,720
No.

413
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,520
I'll take care of you.

414
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,240
I have savings,

415
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,880
and I'm still going to make lots of money.

416
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:19,480
Looks like I don't have to worry
about my future.

417
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:20,840
That's right.

418
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,480
So make sure

419
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,480
that you won't be seduced

420
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:28,840
by those wild women
when you're studying abroad.

421
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:30,680
Tell that to yourself.

422
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,840
Don't be tricked by wild men.

423
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,560
I wasn't tricked!

424
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,920
Ye Luming is a nice guy.

425
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:42,600
I know that in your world,
there are no bad people.

426
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:46,080
That's not true.

427
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,360
For instance,

428
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,240
there's Luo Wenyue.

429
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:54,200
Luo is not a bad person.

430
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,680
She just likes pulling pranks.

431
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:59,640
Okay, I'll call her now
and ask her to come.

432
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,440
Hey. What are you doing?

433
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:05,720
I want to call her! Don't stop me!

434
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,960
What do you want now?

435
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:09,240
Cut it out!

436
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:11,640
All right, I was wrong!

437
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,720
You have no idea.

438
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:19,200
The admin department
is full of old people.

439
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:21,280
It's like an old folks' home.

440
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:24,000
The old supervisor is so stingy and petty

441
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:26,000
over a pen and a piece of paper.

442
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:27,880
Don't complain.

443
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:31,480
I'm newly promoted,
so my subordinates won't listen to me.

444
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,560
They're waiting for me to screw up
to laugh in my face.

445
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:35,840
I heard.

446
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,600
They say that you use your beauty
to gain favors.

447
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:44,320
I suppose being pretty is also a burden.

448
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:46,120
Hey. I also heard

449
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:49,280
that an engineer is still courting you
even though you're taken.

450
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,800
Chang Huan must be pissed.

451
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:53,560
He doesn't have time for that.

452
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,160
He has been so busy.

453
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,040
He's even drafting blueprints
at two in the morning.

454
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:01,280
-How sad.
-Two coffees to go.

455
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,280
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

456
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:07,520
What is it?

457
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,640
What are you looking at?

458
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,520
Here, let me see.

459
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:24,080
Look at this.

460
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,880
Not bad, this is good.

461
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,880
I mean, how did it happen so quickly?

462
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:40,840
What?

463
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:41,960
What's wrong with it?

464
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:43,760
What matters is that they're happy.

465
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,080
This photo is lovely.

466
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:47,880
The thing is,

467
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:50,480
will Yuan Song's parents be okay with it?

468
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:57,120
I don't want to be
like Mrs. Wang from downstairs.

469
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:58,400
Goodness gracious.

470
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:00,280
Weep, bleat, then commit suicide.

471
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:02,080
Please, don't jinx it.

472
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:04,480
Not everyone is like Mrs. Wang.

473
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:08,760
Hopefully not.

474
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,320
Hopefully.

475
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:12,920
Wait, there's more.

476
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,120
Look, here.

477
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:19,120
A member of the He family indeed.
Always quick to act.

478
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:22,840
Isn't it too quick?

479
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:26,400
My uncle must be heartbroken
to see this on his timeline.

480
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,520
Yuan Song is very popular,
so she had to be quick.

481
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,200
Or else, she would miss him forever.

482
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:33,800
That's true.

483
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,480
Yuan Song is quite a catch.

484
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,560
He's handsome and talented.

485
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:40,000
Not to mention his killer smile.

486
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:43,520
Almost half of the girls
in our club like him.

487
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,760
Professor He, are you jealous?

488
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:57,880
The movie is starting.

489
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:14,120
Hey. Look at this.

490
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,040
Get lost!

491
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,080
Did you ask me here to provoke me?

492
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:20,000
Is there no alcohol?

493
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,280
I have a meeting this afternoon.

494
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:24,920
There won't be drinks, just food.

495
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,000
Let's end our friendship.

496
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:30,200
Mr. Song.

497
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:36,880
I'll increase the contract fee tomorrow.

498
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:42,200
Really?

499
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:44,080
Please call me Steven next time.

500
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,600
Here, I'll replace alcohol with tea.

501
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,920
Let's toast to being friends forever.

502
00:30:58,720 --> 00:30:59,640
Friends forever.

503
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,720
<i>Your wish came true.</i>

504
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:11,240
<i>Best wishes.</i>

505
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,360
-Get in.
-Where are we going?

506
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:23,480
Just get in first.

507
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,360
Open it.

508
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,080
HOUSEHOLD REGISTER

509
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:49,720
My household register?

510
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,680
Why do you have it?

511
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:54,760
Did you go to my house?

512
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:55,800
Don't worry.

513
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:58,960
I told your mom that
you needed it to buy a house.

514
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,040
Did you bring your identity card?

515
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,040
Wait, what are you saying?

516
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,720
Why am I buying a house?

517
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:06,800
Where are you taking me?

518
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,160
To the Ministry of Civil Affairs.

519
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:09,800
To get married.

520
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,520
You're finally speechless.

521
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:18,080
I liked you for your independence
and assertion.

522
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,960
But you're too assertive.

523
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,720
As if your life has nothing to do with me.

524
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,720
You chose to bear
this huge matter on your own.

525
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,120
I was pissed.

526
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,880
Even though my future plans

527
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:31,000
don't include the option
of having children,

528
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,280
you are included

529
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,240
in every other option.

530
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:37,400
It won't work without you.

531
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:41,600
So are you...

532
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,840
trying to solve everything
by getting married?

533
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,120
Currently,

534
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:49,080
if I wish to include
the next generation in our plans,

535
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:51,200
we are unprepared in terms of hardware.

536
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:55,360
First, we need to buy a house
that's close to your campus and my office.

537
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,400
He has to settle down and go to school.

538
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:01,160
It should be at least 150 square meters
because we would need a nanny.

539
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,200
Also, we need a bigger car

540
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:07,000
with a bigger back seat
to fit a baby seat.

541
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:09,720
A good care center
has a one-year waiting list

542
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,760
while it's three years
for a good kindergarten.

543
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:13,800
You've thought of everything?

544
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:16,040
That's why I didn't want kids.

545
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:18,760
Having a kid means shifting your focus.

546
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:21,480
Half of your energy will be shifted.

547
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:24,080
I wanted to be like He Fanxing

548
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:25,520
and live a carefree life.

549
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:27,680
But since the baby is here,

550
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,080
what else can we do?

551
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:30,680
We can only welcome him.

552
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,080
Then...

553
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:40,600
No wedding.

554
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,720
I agree, it's too troublesome.

555
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:45,760
I've applied for leave.
We'll go to Japan for our honeymoon.

556
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,760
You do have a visa, right?

557
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:49,720
Zheng Dongyang, you jerk.

558
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,800
How could you keep this from me?

559
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:54,960
It was to get back at you
for not discussing with me.

560
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:58,840
Now, make sure you have a cute baby.

561
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,040
It would be best if it's a girl.

562
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:02,480
Just like He Fanxing.

563
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,240
I can't promise you that.

564
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,720
It will be hard to look like He Fanxing.

565
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,080
She will most probably look like me.

566
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:14,760
To imagine a future

567
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,640
where I'll have to fight
with Professor Song

568
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:18,200
and a smaller version of her,

569
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:20,600
my head hurts.

570
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:23,080
-Then are we still getting married?
-Of course.

571
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:24,360
Bring it on.

572
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,320
DIVORCE AGREEMENT

573
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:50,360
Dear.

574
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:53,560
Did I not do well lately?

575
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,920
I've changed. Why can't you forgive me?

576
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:59,440
You should at least think of our kids!

577
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,480
When you fell for someone else,

578
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,920
did you think about them?

579
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:07,280
That's why I'm going to think for myself.

580
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,760
The Ministry of Civil Affairs
is just next door.

581
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:11,760
It's just a few steps away.

582
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:14,760
Let's get a divorce.

583
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,880
Take your time to read
the asset division agreement.

584
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:24,360
The house, kids, and savings
will be equally divided.

585
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:26,880
All right.

586
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,400
Let's calm down first.

587
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:30,760
Dear.

588
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,280
Please think this through.

589
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,800
I used a whole week

590
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:42,600
to go through one gigabyte of chat logs
between you two.

591
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:46,200
To please the woman you loved,

592
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:48,480
you complained about me and ridiculed me.

593
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:51,080
Sagging breasts like a hot water bag.

594
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:53,880
Shapeless stomach like a swamp.

595
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,880
Buttocks as big as a barrel.

596
00:35:57,320 --> 00:36:00,000
The stench of poop and milk
that won't dissipate.

597
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,880
You feel nauseated
whenever you get close to me.

598
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,400
If I did not read all that,

599
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,520
maybe I would consider forgiving you.

600
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:12,640
Your phone's chat logs

601
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:15,040
are synced

602
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,280
with my laptop.

603
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:20,440
So...

604
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:22,520
You knew all along.

605
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,200
You have been quietly enduring it all.

606
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,160
As Shen Fanfan's wife,

607
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:31,920
I have endured much more

608
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,040
than you could ever imagine.

609
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,840
But it's pointless now.

610
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,720
The lawyer has the chat logs.

611
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:44,480
If you wish to take it to court,
I will have the upper hand.

612
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,360
But you're the father to our kids.

613
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:49,760
I still hope

614
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:54,840
that you'll carry out your role
as their father in the future.

615
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:56,600
For their own sake,

616
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,360
let's not go to court

617
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:01,080
to go through a lawsuit
or fight over properties.

618
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:03,680
It's disgraceful.

619
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:05,920
All right?

620
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,160
I'm sorry.

621
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:14,040
I'm not human.

622
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,120
Fanfan.

623
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,680
From now on, I'm Yang Xiaoyu.

624
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,680
Remember how you feel today.

625
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,360
This feeling of regret,

626
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:33,960
pain,

627
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:35,720
and helplessness.

628
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:38,800
In the future,

629
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,280
live like a proper human.

630
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:05,480
<i>I'm divorced!</i>

631
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:07,640
<i>I'm married!</i>

632
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:13,480
<i>I'm in love!</i>

633
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:15,720
<i>I had an argument!</i>

634
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,840
<i>I'll kill that brat, Cai Minmin!</i>

635
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,480
<i>She fed Baylor onions!</i>

636
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:22,160
What's that?

637
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,720
Just a chaotic daily life.

638
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:32,200
Hey! That's enough.

639
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:34,840
You left your shoes outside.
Go and get them.

640
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:11,520
ONE AND A HALF YEAR LATER

641
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:14,680
They ran out of fennel.

642
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:18,360
How about dumplings
with Chinese cabbage filling?

643
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,520
Okay.

644
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,480
Your dad didn't come with me.

645
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:24,440
He's at home.

646
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,600
I came with Mrs. Wang.

647
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Get back to work.

648
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,160
I won't disturb you. I'm hanging up.

649
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:36,280
So is Fanxing still dating
her young boyfriend?

650
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:37,240
Yes, she is.

651
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,280
That's rare.

652
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:42,400
That guy is studying abroad,
but they're still going strong.

653
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:45,840
She said he's coming back in six months.

654
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,640
Do you think it will work out
between them?

655
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,600
Our Fanxing is so much older than him.

656
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:53,240
What if he changes his mind after a while?

657
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,760
Come on.

658
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:56,280
So what if she's older?

659
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,640
Women live longer than men anyway.

660
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,200
She should get a younger guy.

661
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:02,960
Besides, a marriage might not last forever

662
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,720
and death does not discriminate.

663
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,880
Not every couple can last forever.

664
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:09,360
You're so open-minded.

665
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:12,400
Then why did you oppose your son

666
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:13,960
and Fang Shanshan back then?

667
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,200
That's different.

668
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:18,240
Fang Shanshan is a bad woman.

669
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,440
Let me tell you...

670
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:23,400
These look very fresh.

671
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:25,440
Are they sold for 39.80 yuan?

672
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:26,720
So expensive!

673
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:28,360
That's right.

674
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,200
When you're not the one implicated,

675
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:32,960
you would be open-minded.

676
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:52,200
Hello?

677
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,600
<i>Hey.</i>

678
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:56,560
<i>What are you up to?</i>

679
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:00,480
I'm currently in the shop,

680
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:02,120
but it's not that busy today.

681
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:03,960
How about you? What are you doing?

682
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:05,560
<i>I'm missing you.</i>

683
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:08,880
<i>We haven't met for over three months.</i>

684
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:12,440
Me too.

685
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,080
I really miss you.

686
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:17,560
Why don't I

687
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:19,600
visit you next week?

688
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:22,560
<i>Next week?</i>

689
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,960
<i>But I wish to see you now.
What should I do?</i>

690
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:29,520
What can you do? Be good.

691
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:32,560
I'll go to see you
as soon as I can, all right?

692
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:34,560
<i>No.</i>

693
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:36,920
<i>I'm going to find myself an Anywhere Door.</i>

694
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:40,480
<i>Then I'll go through it
and appear at your flower shop.</i>

695
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:43,240
Okay, go look for it.

696
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:46,880
If you can come here right now
through the door,

697
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:49,720
then I will...

698
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:51,920
<i>Will you register our marriage?</i>

699
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:55,840
Okay, but you have to be here first.

700
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:00,680
Welcome.

701
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:12,160
My goodness! What happened?

702
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:13,520
I really made it through!

703
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:19,920
You're back. When did you come back?

704
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,560
I came through the Anywhere Door.

705
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:23,480
Are you surprised?

706
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:43,000
<i>May your days be filled with sunshine.</i>

707
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:45,360
<i>May there be roses in your embrace.</i>

708
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:48,640
<i>May you have a shelter from the storm.</i>

709
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:51,240
<i>May time be kind to you.</i>

710
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:55,600
<i>May you always be a young girl at heart.</i>

711
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:04,680
