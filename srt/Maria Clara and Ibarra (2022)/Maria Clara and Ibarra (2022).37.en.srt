00:00:27,327 --> 00:00:29,996
MARIA CLARA AND IBARRA

2
00:00:31,264 --> 00:00:35,168
THIS PROGRAM, WHICH IS ADAPTED
FROM THE NOVELS OF DR. JOSE P. RIZAL,

3
00:00:35,235 --> 00:00:40,173
IS PRESENTED USING DRAMATIC ELEMENTS
TO CONNECT THE PRESENT AND THE PAST

4
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:46,379
IN A SPECIAL REIMAGINING OF THE NATIONAL
LITERATURE FILIPINOS ARE PROUD OF.

5
00:00:46,446 --> 00:00:49,382
<i>We are here to confiscate evidence</i>

6
00:00:49,449 --> 00:00:53,553
<i>that is linked to the arrest
of Crisostomo Ibarra.</i>

7
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:54,654
We don't have much time.

8
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:56,656
How are we going
to get rid of these sacks?

9
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:58,258
PREVIOUSLY

10
00:01:04,798 --> 00:01:06,066
Search for the entire house!

11
00:01:06,132 --> 00:01:07,233
<i>Take everything.</i>

12
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:09,402
<i>All the money, all the documents.</i>

13
00:01:09,469 --> 00:01:12,005
Señorito, I smell something burning.

14
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:15,408
If we can't get anything here,
then arrest them.

15
00:01:15,475 --> 00:01:18,578
<i>Arrest everyone connected
to Crisostomo Ibarra.</i>

16
00:01:18,645 --> 00:01:23,583
Miss Klay, it would be better for you
to escape and hide in my store.

17
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:27,520
Ibarra and I need someone on the lookout.

18
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:30,256
As soon as everything has been resolved,

19
00:01:30,323 --> 00:01:32,258
you will be the first one I will look for.

20
00:01:32,325 --> 00:01:35,328
<i>The alferez gave the order
to arrest anyone</i>

21
00:01:35,395 --> 00:01:37,997
<i>associated with Mister Crisostomo?</i>

22
00:01:38,064 --> 00:01:39,299
Will they arrest us too?

23
00:01:39,365 --> 00:01:40,700
It's better to be sure.

24
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:41,935
Especially you, Santiago.

25
00:01:42,001 --> 00:01:43,937
<i>No one will stop you from leaving.</i>

26
00:01:44,003 --> 00:01:47,607
<i>But I will stay here in San Diego,
to be with Crisostomo.</i>

27
00:01:47,674 --> 00:01:50,176
Would you like to recant
what you just said

28
00:01:50,243 --> 00:01:51,611
and what you said earlier?

29
00:01:51,678 --> 00:01:53,780
There is nothing to recant, sir.

30
00:01:53,847 --> 00:01:56,649
What I said earlier
is not a call to revolt

31
00:01:56,716 --> 00:02:00,420
<i>but a wish that I hope
people in authority can hear.</i>

32
00:02:00,487 --> 00:02:04,457
<i>Those are the grievances
of the natives in this town.</i>

33
00:02:04,524 --> 00:02:05,925
Because of what you said,

34
00:02:05,992 --> 00:02:10,530
you will face life imprisonment
and the death penalty.

35
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:21,174
Civil Guard.

36
00:02:23,676 --> 00:02:26,546
Were you able to give
the missive containing details

37
00:02:26,613 --> 00:02:28,314
of our arrest to my lawyer?

38
00:02:28,381 --> 00:02:31,818
Just talk to the sergeant
tomorrow when he comes back.

39
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:37,390
Where is Crisostomo Ibarra?

40
00:02:37,457 --> 00:02:39,926
Isn't he being detained here?

41
00:02:47,567 --> 00:02:50,270
Basilio, hurry!

42
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:52,739
You're so slow.

43
00:02:52,805 --> 00:02:55,208
-Hurry, catch up.
-Gosh, Juli.

44
00:02:55,275 --> 00:02:59,779
If I catch you, you will squirm again
when I tickle you.

45
00:03:02,482 --> 00:03:04,117
Oh, Basilio!

46
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:09,289
I'm sorry, Basilio.

47
00:03:10,423 --> 00:03:12,825
Come on, Juli.

48
00:03:12,892 --> 00:03:15,495
You know that the wounds
on his legs have not healed yet.

49
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,766
Where's Father?

50
00:03:19,832 --> 00:03:21,701
At the farm, Father.

51
00:03:21,768 --> 00:03:23,803
How's everything in town?

52
00:03:24,804 --> 00:03:27,874
Our affairs at the town hall
were delayed yesterday.

53
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:30,210
A lot of things are happening in town.

54
00:03:32,111 --> 00:03:35,014
Do your feet hurt, Basilio?

55
00:03:35,081 --> 00:03:38,184
Yes. But I can manage, Sir Tales.

56
00:03:38,751 --> 00:03:44,057
My feet need to get used to walking again,

57
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:48,828
so I can finally see my mother.

58
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:53,299
I hope my brother is already home.

59
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:02,909
Yes, Basilio.

60
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:05,044
He is already home.

61
00:04:05,111 --> 00:04:10,316
I saw your mother hugging
your brother yesterday.

62
00:04:10,383 --> 00:04:12,385
Really?

63
00:04:12,452 --> 00:04:17,123
That means I can embrace
my mother and Crispin soon.

64
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:19,826
The Lord heard our prayers, Juli.

65
00:04:21,861 --> 00:04:25,965
Gosh, this kid.

66
00:04:26,032 --> 00:04:29,235
It seems only yesterday when we found you

67
00:04:29,302 --> 00:04:33,106
in the woods unconscious
and ridden with scars.

68
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:40,313
Always remember this, son.

69
00:04:41,414 --> 00:04:46,686
No matter how deep or painful
are the wounds we incur in life,

70
00:04:46,753 --> 00:04:49,956
they will heal someday.

71
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:53,526
Thank you so much for everything.

72
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,931
I promise to tell my mother
and Crispin about you always.

73
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:03,303
All right, then.

74
00:05:04,537 --> 00:05:06,539
Let me help you, Father.

75
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:08,975
Come on, Basilio.

76
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:09,976
Be careful.

77
00:05:10,043 --> 00:05:10,910
All right.

78
00:05:25,191 --> 00:05:30,363
<i>We are forever grateful to You
for keeping me, Maria,</i>

79
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:36,169
<i>and Isabel from being arrested
and shamed in society.</i>

80
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:40,373
<i>Thank You for preventing
the wedding from happening</i>

81
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:44,444
<i>before Crisostomo was taken
to prison for being a filibuster.</i>

82
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:48,081
<i>I promise to donate more</i>

83
00:05:48,147 --> 00:05:51,384
<i>to the Church this month.</i>

84
00:05:55,221 --> 00:05:56,456
Primo?

85
00:05:58,725 --> 00:06:01,060
I'm worried.

86
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:04,497
Clarita refuses to leave her room.

87
00:06:05,965 --> 00:06:09,736
Isn't it enough that we are staying
in San Diego with her?

88
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:13,506
She will eventually feel hungry.

89
00:06:13,573 --> 00:06:16,642
And she will come out
of her room on her own.

90
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:47,340
Doña Victorina, Don Tiburcio,
Señor Linares,

91
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:49,075
what brings you here?

92
00:06:49,142 --> 00:06:52,011
I'm glad that you were not arrested.

93
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:55,014
I am very thankful, Tiago. So grateful.

94
00:06:55,081 --> 00:07:00,186
It seems that the Lord
has granted us our freedom

95
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:07,126
and another chance at a bright future,

96
00:07:09,195 --> 00:07:12,899
especially for your only daughter.

97
00:07:14,901 --> 00:07:16,569
Tiago,

98
00:07:19,705 --> 00:07:25,812
perhaps your association

99
00:07:25,878 --> 00:07:28,448
with the filibuster, Ibarra,
has been severed?

100
00:07:32,051 --> 00:07:33,486
Good, Tiago.

101
00:07:33,553 --> 00:07:34,787
Good.

102
00:07:34,854 --> 00:07:38,157
In that case, we can continue arranging

103
00:07:38,224 --> 00:07:41,794
the marriage between
Alfonso and Maria Clara.

104
00:08:26,372 --> 00:08:29,075
She seems happy here, doesn't she, Lucia?

105
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:37,483
It figures.

106
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:41,687
In town, people either make fun
of her or hurt her,

107
00:08:41,754 --> 00:08:45,591
that's why she always escapes.

108
00:08:45,658 --> 00:08:48,594
Maybe she was imprisoned
in different ways.

109
00:08:51,731 --> 00:08:54,734
Sisa is like a bird.

110
00:08:54,800 --> 00:09:00,573
They will never be truly safe
if they are hindered from flying away.

111
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:05,611
Look at her.

112
00:09:05,678 --> 00:09:08,414
She might not be
in the right state of mind

113
00:09:08,481 --> 00:09:11,751
but she remains in high spirits
in this place.

114
00:09:11,817 --> 00:09:14,754
Somehow, she can freely spread her
wings here.

115
00:09:16,656 --> 00:09:17,757
It seems like it.

116
00:09:20,793 --> 00:09:24,363
But she will be happier
if she is reunited with Basilio.

117
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:27,967
Maybe Basilio is also gone?

118
00:09:29,602 --> 00:09:32,038
Only one of the siblings died.

119
00:09:34,307 --> 00:09:36,909
Only one? Said who?

120
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:41,013
Nothing.

121
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:44,383
I just believe that Basilio
is still alive.

122
00:09:48,054 --> 00:09:50,923
I am just worried about Sisa

123
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:53,159
and her happy ending.

124
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,963
Especially when I leave this wor…

125
00:10:01,834 --> 00:10:04,003
I am worried about Sisa

126
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:07,239
especially when I become
preoccupied with other things.

127
00:10:09,909 --> 00:10:13,879
I admire your concern
for other people, miss.

128
00:10:15,081 --> 00:10:17,950
I remember the time when you helped me,

129
00:10:18,017 --> 00:10:20,119
even if I was just a stranger,

130
00:10:20,186 --> 00:10:22,288
even if we were not related to each other.

131
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:26,492
What more for Ibarra, Sisa, and her sons?

132
00:10:32,365 --> 00:10:33,633
To repay your kindness,

133
00:10:33,699 --> 00:10:36,569
I want to help you again.

134
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,437
I can't bring her to our camp

135
00:10:38,504 --> 00:10:44,010
because I know that
this is already her home.

136
00:10:45,044 --> 00:10:49,315
But I want to look after her
from time to time.

137
00:10:49,382 --> 00:10:51,283
Make sure she's safe.

138
00:10:53,953 --> 00:10:56,589
Will you really do that, Lucia?

139
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:00,793
Thank you.

140
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:03,162
Thank you very much.

141
00:11:11,237 --> 00:11:15,408
Kindness is not just repaid with kindness.

142
00:11:16,609 --> 00:11:20,346
It is also meant to be shared and spread.

143
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:30,790
Let's go to the hut.

144
00:11:31,891 --> 00:11:37,730
I will prepare Crispin and Basilio's
favorite dish for you.

145
00:11:46,739 --> 00:11:47,740
Let's go.

146
00:11:47,807 --> 00:11:48,841
Let's go now.

147
00:11:48,908 --> 00:11:51,277
Put that here, Sisa.

148
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:01,787
Mother!

149
00:12:01,854 --> 00:12:03,789
Crispin!

150
00:12:05,091 --> 00:12:06,826
Mother!

151
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:10,196
Crispin!

152
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:17,403
Mother!

153
00:12:18,771 --> 00:12:20,306
Crispin!

154
00:12:41,327 --> 00:12:42,895
Sisa.

155
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:46,332
We need to go.

156
00:12:48,868 --> 00:12:50,269
Me too.

157
00:12:51,871 --> 00:12:53,773
I am going home.

158
00:12:55,007 --> 00:12:57,710
My children might be waiting for me.

159
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:03,449
But Lucia will be back.

160
00:13:03,516 --> 00:13:05,518
She will check on you from time to time.

161
00:13:07,653 --> 00:13:10,556
I will just be in our hut.

162
00:13:12,358 --> 00:13:14,994
I will wait there,

163
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:21,000
for nothing.

164
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:29,408
Maybe Basilio is also not there.

165
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:37,550
Am I really waiting for nothing?

166
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:48,027
Sisa, listen to me.

167
00:13:55,134 --> 00:13:59,238
That may have become ill

168
00:13:59,305 --> 00:14:02,208
but as long as this is beating,

169
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:05,911
everything is possible.

170
00:14:07,613 --> 00:14:10,850
You can overcome everything.

171
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:17,523
Do you remember what I told you back then?

172
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:22,428
Just hold on, Sisa.

173
00:14:23,896 --> 00:14:25,598
Don't give up.

174
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:30,069
Your son will return.

175
00:14:32,238 --> 00:14:35,608
Isn't that what you
and Basilio agreed to do?

176
00:14:35,674 --> 00:14:39,211
Whatever happens…

177
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:40,946
Whatever happens…

178
00:14:41,013 --> 00:14:42,948
You, your brother Crispin,

179
00:14:43,015 --> 00:14:46,485
and I will go home to our hut together.

180
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:48,520
Just don't leave your mother.

181
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:52,291
Right.

182
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:56,929
We are going to see each other…

183
00:14:58,631 --> 00:15:00,699
in our hut.

184
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:43,375
Mother?

185
00:15:45,244 --> 00:15:46,679
Mother?

186
00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:12,504
Who is buried here?

187
00:16:13,739 --> 00:16:15,140
No.

188
00:16:15,207 --> 00:16:17,009
This can't be.

189
00:16:20,045 --> 00:16:22,247
This can't be!

190
00:16:24,717 --> 00:16:29,321
Crispin.

191
00:16:32,024 --> 00:16:34,593
Crispin.

192
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,428
Mother.

193
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:38,864
Crispin.

194
00:16:38,931 --> 00:16:42,134
Crispin, Mother.

195
00:16:42,201 --> 00:16:44,236
Mother.

196
00:16:46,205 --> 00:16:47,840
Brother is here.

197
00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:51,043
Pablito.

198
00:16:52,044 --> 00:16:55,147
I will prepare the things
that we will need.

199
00:16:55,214 --> 00:16:58,851
If we are lucky, we can take home
a lot of weapons later.

200
00:16:58,917 --> 00:17:02,688
Maybe there are one or two weapons.

201
00:17:02,755 --> 00:17:06,859
Not more than six because there are
several prisoners there now.

202
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:10,429
According to Elena, by nine o'clock
in the evening,

203
00:17:10,496 --> 00:17:13,298
only one to two guards are left.

204
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:15,300
Others go on patrol.

205
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:18,737
Thanks again, Lucia.

206
00:17:18,804 --> 00:17:21,173
After our discussion last night,

207
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:26,445
I didn't expect you to execute
the planned escape for Ibarra.

208
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:32,551
You will let Sir Ibarra and Fidel
escape from prison?

209
00:17:37,623 --> 00:17:39,658
Are you really going to do that?

210
00:17:40,993 --> 00:17:42,394
What's our plan?

211
00:17:42,461 --> 00:17:44,763
How are we going to do it?

212
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:47,566
What we are about to do later is risky.

213
00:17:47,633 --> 00:17:49,468
It's dangerous.

214
00:17:49,535 --> 00:17:51,937
You should stay here.

215
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:54,406
I don't want to.

216
00:17:54,473 --> 00:17:57,109
I just can't sit here and wait.

217
00:17:57,176 --> 00:17:58,677
I want to help.

218
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:07,186
That's enough.

219
00:18:08,554 --> 00:18:09,988
Sir!

220
00:18:13,792 --> 00:18:15,427
We need to escape now.

221
00:18:15,494 --> 00:18:17,329
Go ahead.

222
00:18:17,396 --> 00:18:18,764
Miss.

223
00:18:18,831 --> 00:18:19,765
Miss!

224
00:18:19,832 --> 00:18:21,967
Come to think of it,

225
00:18:22,034 --> 00:18:27,039
if we talk about bravery and acuity,

226
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,109
I am certain that we can count on Klay.

227
00:18:30,976 --> 00:18:35,614
One more thing, isn't it better if

228
00:18:35,681 --> 00:18:37,916
two women will be going there tonight?

229
00:18:38,984 --> 00:18:42,788
There you go, Lucia. Take me with you.

230
00:18:42,855 --> 00:18:44,923
Whatever that is, I can do it.

231
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:54,867
All right, miss.

232
00:18:54,933 --> 00:18:57,569
You want to fight
for the liberation of Ibarra

233
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:58,971
and others, as a woman.

234
00:18:59,037 --> 00:19:01,740
But can you handle being
a prostitute tonight?

235
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:03,876
A prostitute?

236
00:19:25,197 --> 00:19:31,203
Excuse me, can one of my employees
bring me food?

237
00:19:32,204 --> 00:19:35,040
My stomach hurts
from eating sweet potatoes.

238
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:44,316
I want to make you realize
that you are no longer rich here.

239
00:19:44,383 --> 00:19:47,686
So whatever they are eating,
you will eat it too.

240
00:19:48,921 --> 00:19:50,289
Prisoner!

241
00:19:56,562 --> 00:20:00,032
With all due respect, mister,

242
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:05,337
this man you are mocking
has a law degree.

243
00:20:05,404 --> 00:20:10,142
I know the law states that
the health and rights

244
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,144
of every prisoner must be considered.

245
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:17,416
All right then, free yourself now.

246
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:24,156
Don't be impatient, mister.

247
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:29,528
My brilliant lawyer from Manila
will arrive tomorrow.

248
00:20:29,595 --> 00:20:33,865
In an instant, my friend
and I will be set free.

249
00:20:33,932 --> 00:20:36,368
In an instant?

250
00:20:36,435 --> 00:20:39,638
You will get used to sleeping here soon,

251
00:20:39,705 --> 00:20:43,175
until you look like a native.

252
00:20:55,354 --> 00:20:57,422
They are getting bolder and bolder.

253
00:20:58,991 --> 00:21:00,993
Their horns are growing longer.

254
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:06,732
That's because their alferez latches on
like a leech to the mayor.

255
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:14,740
I told myself that I will never be
a shadow or a tool for such a leader.

256
00:21:14,806 --> 00:21:21,380
Is that why you resigned
as Lieutenant Major of San Diego?

257
00:21:22,848 --> 00:21:27,653
That's why I supported
Crisostomo's school.

258
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:31,490
And now, here I am.

259
00:21:32,491 --> 00:21:36,128
A filibuster and a prisoner.

260
00:21:42,701 --> 00:21:49,408
Those who do good things for the country
are called criminals.

261
00:21:50,876 --> 00:21:53,445
While those who commit sins

262
00:21:53,512 --> 00:21:59,084
in the church and the government
must be called "honorable."

263
00:22:00,719 --> 00:22:02,321
Animals!

264
00:22:03,689 --> 00:22:05,557
That's true.

265
00:22:05,624 --> 00:22:10,529
It is complicated to teach

266
00:22:10,595 --> 00:22:12,364
an old dog new tricks.

267
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:18,170
That's why the youth
is the hope of this town.

268
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:23,508
Señor Delos Reyes,

269
00:22:26,378 --> 00:22:30,215
you sacrificed your freedom
for your friends,

270
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:35,754
Señor Crisostomo and Ms. Klay,
and for the school

271
00:22:35,821 --> 00:22:39,424
that was supposed to be
beneficial for the town.

272
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,295
But Don Fidel,

273
00:22:44,629 --> 00:22:49,234
how much are you willing
to fight for our country

274
00:22:49,301 --> 00:22:56,308
without relying on prayers,
connections, or your wealth?

275
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:05,050
Good evening, handsome gentlemen!

276
00:23:05,117 --> 00:23:06,618
Elena.

277
00:23:06,685 --> 00:23:08,320
How are you tonight?

278
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:12,691
I brought along my friends from Manila.

279
00:23:12,758 --> 00:23:14,793
Good evening, gentlemen!

280
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:17,763
It seems that a pretty lady
wandered in here.

281
00:23:17,829 --> 00:23:20,999
What can we do for you, miss?

282
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:23,702
The best question is

283
00:23:23,769 --> 00:23:29,274
what can a woman do for
a handsome gentleman like you,

284
00:23:29,341 --> 00:23:31,777
especially on a cold night?

285
00:23:31,843 --> 00:23:35,480
But as you can see,
there are two of us here.

286
00:23:35,547 --> 00:23:39,818
Even two dogs get bored sharing a bone.

287
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:48,460
Do you think we will let any
of you get lonely?

288
00:23:51,163 --> 00:23:53,565
Your wine is also on me, gentlemen.

289
00:24:09,748 --> 00:24:12,784
A beautiful lady that came from Manila.

290
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:16,755
I am actually from another world.

291
00:24:19,558 --> 00:24:20,826
A beautiful woman.

292
00:24:20,892 --> 00:24:23,628
I am sure this will be a steamy night.

293
00:24:23,695 --> 00:24:26,398
You seem to be in a hurry, señor.

294
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:33,705
Because the other dogs will come soon.

295
00:24:33,772 --> 00:24:35,440
I won't have you for myself then.

296
00:24:36,007 --> 00:24:38,176
Then let's not waste time.

297
00:24:38,243 --> 00:24:41,346
Let this wine warm up
your bodies, gentlemen.

298
00:25:12,711 --> 00:25:13,912
Elena.

299
00:25:15,113 --> 00:25:16,882
I'll stand guard outside.

300
00:25:17,716 --> 00:25:18,783
Let's move.

301
00:25:19,284 --> 00:25:20,252
Hurry.

302
00:25:24,155 --> 00:25:25,991
Ms. Klay, what you're doing is dangerous.

303
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,929
You have saved my life countless times.

304
00:25:32,931 --> 00:25:36,301
Forgive me if I rarely
acknowledge everything you do.

305
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:37,302
I'm sorry.

306
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:39,204
But I am wholeheartedly grateful.

307
00:25:39,271 --> 00:25:40,205
Thank you so much.

308
00:25:40,272 --> 00:25:41,406
It's okay.

309
00:25:41,473 --> 00:25:42,674
It's okay, sir.

310
00:25:42,741 --> 00:25:45,010
I'm not even sure if I can open this up.

311
00:25:46,011 --> 00:25:47,312
Oh, there.

312
00:25:55,854 --> 00:25:57,322
Ms. Klay.

313
00:26:08,767 --> 00:26:09,634
Let's go!

314
00:26:09,701 --> 00:26:12,904
The other civil guards might catch us
when they get here for their duty.

315
00:26:12,971 --> 00:26:15,674
Wait, how about Fidel?
I still need to look for his cell.

316
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:16,942
We don't have time!

317
00:26:17,008 --> 00:26:19,144
They will kill us if they catch us.

318
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:22,447
-But…
-Miss, let's go!

319
00:26:29,654 --> 00:26:33,725
I let Lucia go first with the weapons
that we collected.

320
00:26:33,792 --> 00:26:36,661
Are we really not going back for Fidel?

321
00:26:36,728 --> 00:26:38,563
Sir Ibarra, why were you
in different cells?

322
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:41,366
-Where is he?
-I don't know where he is.

323
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:44,569
He might be in another cell with others.

324
00:26:44,636 --> 00:26:47,906
I cannot be at ease
if we leave my friend there.

325
00:26:50,008 --> 00:26:51,543
Miss,

326
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:53,345
we can come back for him some other day.

327
00:26:53,411 --> 00:26:55,413
It is dangerous if we go back there.

328
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:58,850
Right now, it is important
that you escape, sir.

329
00:26:58,917 --> 00:27:00,852
Let's split up here.

330
00:27:00,919 --> 00:27:03,688
I'll go here, you go there.

331
00:27:04,255 --> 00:27:06,091
We will go back to the camp.

332
00:27:07,659 --> 00:27:11,763
You need to get away from the town,
Sir Crisostomo.

333
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:16,034
Elias and Miss Klay will go with you

334
00:27:16,101 --> 00:27:19,237
by boat through the lake.

335
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:22,140
Then, you will go to the grave.

336
00:27:25,043 --> 00:27:27,112
Whose grave?

337
00:27:28,847 --> 00:27:31,316
Of Don Pedro Eibarramendia.

338
00:27:36,421 --> 00:27:39,758
Does Fidel know where that is?

339
00:27:41,059 --> 00:27:45,797
The carriage that will take us
to Mandaluyong is near that grave.

340
00:27:47,065 --> 00:27:50,168
I'll take you to my friend
and you will hide there.

341
00:27:50,235 --> 00:27:55,240
Sir, here's everything that Miss Klay
has saved from your house.

342
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:14,259
I don't know how I can thank all of you.

343
00:28:15,927 --> 00:28:21,199
You all saved my life from certain death,

344
00:28:22,167 --> 00:28:24,102
despite everything.

345
00:28:25,103 --> 00:28:27,005
Until we meet again, Sir Ibarra.

346
00:28:28,339 --> 00:28:29,240
Elias.

347
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:31,710
Ms. Klay.

348
00:28:33,445 --> 00:28:34,946
Be careful, Pablito.

349
00:28:40,852 --> 00:28:42,754
We need to hurry.

350
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,328
Where is Ms. Klay?

351
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:11,416
Mother?

352
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:21,526
Ouch.

353
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:32,604
Mother?

354
00:29:46,184 --> 00:29:49,387
Why do you look like that?

355
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:52,157
And why do you have scars?

356
00:29:52,223 --> 00:29:54,559
Who did this to you?

357
00:29:56,394 --> 00:29:58,096
Mother,

358
00:29:58,163 --> 00:30:00,465
where is Crispin?

359
00:30:02,433 --> 00:30:08,039
Don't tell me that he's
the one buried here?

360
00:30:08,106 --> 00:30:10,909
Crispin is at peace now.

361
00:30:12,911 --> 00:30:14,546
Crispin!

362
00:30:14,612 --> 00:30:16,447
Who did this to you?

363
00:30:17,015 --> 00:30:18,917
Who?

364
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:28,693
Basilio is also in heaven now.

365
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,595
Mother,

366
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:33,431
what are you talking about?

367
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:36,034
This is me, Basilio!

368
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:44,943
I have already accepted
that my sons are now angels.

369
00:30:46,211 --> 00:30:50,181
They will never take another child from me
nor will they hurt me again.

370
00:30:52,317 --> 00:30:56,087
Mother, don't you recognize me?

371
00:30:57,589 --> 00:30:59,624
Mother, I'm your son.

372
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:01,893
I'm Basilio.

373
00:31:15,173 --> 00:31:17,275
Basilio…

374
00:31:20,912 --> 00:31:23,381
Basilio, my son.

375
00:31:23,448 --> 00:31:25,850
My son.

376
00:31:25,917 --> 00:31:27,552
My son.

377
00:31:27,619 --> 00:31:29,621
Liar!

378
00:31:30,622 --> 00:31:32,657
You are a liar.

379
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:34,759
You're a demon, right?

380
00:31:34,826 --> 00:31:37,495
You are a demon pretending to be my son!

381
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:39,597
The friars are right.

382
00:31:39,664 --> 00:31:42,667
You are going to burn my soul in hell.

383
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:45,236
-Mother.
-Get away from me!

384
00:31:45,303 --> 00:31:46,304
Get away from me!

385
00:31:46,371 --> 00:31:48,039
-Mother!
-Get away from me!

386
00:31:51,109 --> 00:31:54,112
Mother!

387
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:00,985
Ms. Klay!

388
00:32:01,052 --> 00:32:02,687
Friend, it's dangerous.

389
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:04,122
Don't go back there.

390
00:32:04,188 --> 00:32:05,990
But what do you want me to do?

391
00:32:06,057 --> 00:32:09,227
To just abandon my friend?

392
00:32:09,294 --> 00:32:11,663
She saved my life.

393
00:32:11,729 --> 00:32:14,065
Do you think you can save her

394
00:32:14,132 --> 00:32:16,467
if she gets in danger?

395
00:32:16,534 --> 00:32:21,039
Sir, she dared to go back there alone.

396
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:24,976
So just pray that she'll be able
to help your friend escape.

397
00:32:25,043 --> 00:32:27,979
But I will not allow you
to return to that place.

398
00:32:28,046 --> 00:32:30,915
Klay would also not be pleased
if you go back to the place

399
00:32:30,982 --> 00:32:33,151
where we helped you escape.

400
00:32:34,252 --> 00:32:37,388
So, sir, don't go there.

401
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:41,759
Do not waste the sacrifice
that your friends made for you.

402
00:32:43,428 --> 00:32:44,996
Let's go.

403
00:33:10,922 --> 00:33:13,758
Lord, please take care of me.

404
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:17,195
This is my only chance to save Fidel.

405
00:33:24,569 --> 00:33:26,070
Fidel.

406
00:33:26,137 --> 00:33:27,672
Fidel!

407
00:33:30,375 --> 00:33:31,642
Ms. Klay!

408
00:33:31,709 --> 00:33:33,077
What are you doing here?

409
00:33:33,144 --> 00:33:34,679
We don't have much time left.

410
00:33:34,746 --> 00:33:35,980
Wake them up.

411
00:33:37,215 --> 00:33:39,751
Mr. Filipo, school teacher.

412
00:33:48,059 --> 00:33:49,627
Teacher.

413
00:33:52,063 --> 00:33:53,631
Teacher, wake up.

414
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:55,233
What are you doing here?

415
00:34:01,806 --> 00:34:04,275
Please, sir.

416
00:34:04,342 --> 00:34:05,710
Don't shoot her.

417
00:34:05,777 --> 00:34:09,080
Don't tell me what to do, prisoner.

418
00:34:09,147 --> 00:34:12,917
You know that if you are going
to help filibusters,

419
00:34:12,984 --> 00:34:14,886
you will be punished.

420
00:34:17,054 --> 00:34:18,289
Don't kill me yet.

421
00:34:18,356 --> 00:34:19,724
-I still have…
-Don't move.

422
00:34:19,791 --> 00:34:21,726
One flick of this gun and you're dead!

423
00:34:21,793 --> 00:34:23,294
Lord, please.

424
00:34:23,361 --> 00:34:25,363
I still have many goals.
I still have many dreams.

425
00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:27,265
I still want to see my mommy.

426
00:34:32,103 --> 00:34:33,504
Come on.

427
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:34,472
Let's escape.

428
00:34:34,539 --> 00:34:35,506
Don't forget Adong.

429
00:34:35,573 --> 00:34:36,441
Get the key.

430
00:34:37,442 --> 00:34:39,110
-Get Sir Adong.
-Yes.

431
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:45,516
Sir Adong, let's go.

432
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:46,584
Hurry.

433
00:34:49,821 --> 00:34:50,688
Are you okay?

434
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:52,056
Let's go, Adong.

435
00:34:56,494 --> 00:34:58,062
-Where are you going?
-Fidel!

436
00:34:58,129 --> 00:34:59,464
Fidel!

437
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:03,868
-Fidel!
-Come here.

438
00:35:09,707 --> 00:35:11,709
Let her go!

439
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:13,778
Go ahead, shoot!

440
00:35:13,845 --> 00:35:15,513
I know you are weak.

441
00:35:40,338 --> 00:35:41,539
Let's go.

442
00:35:53,184 --> 00:35:55,253
Hold on, friend.

443
00:36:02,393 --> 00:36:04,295
Sir,

444
00:36:05,296 --> 00:36:10,501
you can use your money
and power to go to Europe.

445
00:36:10,568 --> 00:36:12,904
You have a lot of friends there, right?

446
00:36:29,754 --> 00:36:32,957
Your misfortune was my family's fault.

447
00:36:35,326 --> 00:36:37,495
Let me make it up to you.

448
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:41,699
Come with me.

449
00:36:41,766 --> 00:36:44,669
We can live there as brothers.

450
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:52,476
Love and happiness may be
elusive in this country,

451
00:36:53,778 --> 00:36:58,249
but I choose to endure
and die in my homeland.

452
00:36:58,316 --> 00:37:01,152
But why are you asking me to leave?

453
00:37:03,788 --> 00:37:07,525
Because you can be happy
in another country, sir.

454
00:37:08,793 --> 00:37:10,528
But not me.

455
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:15,466
You were not born to suffer.

456
00:37:19,604 --> 00:37:22,640
But aren't all these sufferings?

457
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:26,577
I lost my father.

458
00:37:26,644 --> 00:37:28,846
My dignity was taken away from me.

459
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:31,515
All my friends are gone.

460
00:37:35,486 --> 00:37:38,256
And even the woman I truly love.

461
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:43,027
Your Maria Clara.

462
00:38:00,211 --> 00:38:03,514
Our love is bound in prayers, my love.

463
00:38:03,581 --> 00:38:08,185
Promise me that our love
will always be with you,

464
00:38:08,252 --> 00:38:10,454
and that rosary too.

465
00:38:10,521 --> 00:38:12,123
I promise.

466
00:38:24,702 --> 00:38:26,504
Crisostomo…

467
00:38:55,533 --> 00:38:58,336
If I were to leave this country,

468
00:39:01,639 --> 00:39:04,642
I need to see her first, Elias.

469
00:39:31,769 --> 00:39:33,771
Help us!

470
00:39:33,838 --> 00:39:35,306
Help us, please!

471
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:38,242
Help them, please!

472
00:39:46,617 --> 00:39:49,487
Elena, who did this to you?

473
00:39:49,553 --> 00:39:53,524
I didn't recognize them.
Their faces were covered.

474
00:39:53,591 --> 00:39:56,794
They hurt me. Then they died.

475
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:03,934
Señor, the guard in the other cell
was also shot.

476
00:40:04,001 --> 00:40:05,236
Señor.

477
00:40:11,142 --> 00:40:13,544
Incompetents!

478
00:40:13,611 --> 00:40:16,013
Stupid!

479
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:19,083
Find the criminals and arrest them.

480
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:21,452
Right away, sir!

481
00:40:21,519 --> 00:40:23,387
Let's go!

482
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,275
Are we safe now?

483
00:40:47,011 --> 00:40:48,946
We are safe.

484
00:40:49,013 --> 00:40:50,481
For now.

485
00:40:50,548 --> 00:40:51,849
How terrible.

486
00:40:51,916 --> 00:40:53,584
That was close.

487
00:40:58,189 --> 00:41:00,124
You're shaking.

488
00:41:01,392 --> 00:41:03,060
Klay,

489
00:41:04,195 --> 00:41:07,431
do you think I killed the man I shot?

490
00:41:18,976 --> 00:41:21,045
Klay, you are also shaking.

491
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:26,984
Because we almost died, didn't we?

492
00:41:27,051 --> 00:41:29,186
I thought I could not save you.

493
00:41:29,253 --> 00:41:31,155
I thought we would die there.

494
00:41:31,222 --> 00:41:33,157
I thought that was really goodbye.

495
00:41:35,259 --> 00:41:37,061
Klay,

496
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:42,233
I was saved by your love.

497
00:42:26,844 --> 00:42:28,178
My love,

498
00:42:48,866 --> 00:42:51,869
I thought I would never see you again.

499
00:42:58,042 --> 00:43:01,512
Ms. Klay helped me escape from prison,

500
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:05,616
with the help of Elias' group.

501
00:43:05,683 --> 00:43:10,888
Klay is a true friend at all times.

502
00:43:17,061 --> 00:43:19,063
While, I…

503
00:43:20,097 --> 00:43:23,200
even if I wanted to visit you in prison,

504
00:43:24,535 --> 00:43:27,905
I was ashamed to face you.

505
00:43:31,008 --> 00:43:32,576
I…

506
00:43:32,643 --> 00:43:38,482
I caused your predicament.

507
00:43:38,549 --> 00:43:40,751
So, judge me.

508
00:43:43,654 --> 00:43:48,158
I can never do that to you, my love.

509
00:43:50,561 --> 00:43:57,334
But I know there is only one monster
who orchestrated all of this.

510
00:43:57,401 --> 00:44:00,671
We were used and played.

511
00:44:04,208 --> 00:44:08,379
That's why
you should stop crying, my love.

512
00:44:10,247 --> 00:44:12,883
In the face of a thousand dangers,

513
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:17,154
I came here to ask for your forgiveness.

514
00:44:20,858 --> 00:44:24,161
Because I can no longer fulfill our dream,

515
00:44:24,228 --> 00:44:27,097
our promise to each other.

516
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:32,503
What?

517
00:44:34,605 --> 00:44:37,074
That is…

518
00:44:37,141 --> 00:44:40,611
That is the death of my heart, Crisostomo.

519
00:44:41,879 --> 00:44:45,015
You're my love. You're my life.

520
00:44:47,885 --> 00:44:50,654
But tonight,

521
00:44:50,721 --> 00:44:53,824
I have been declared…

522
00:44:53,891 --> 00:44:56,260
I am now a fugitive.

523
00:44:57,561 --> 00:45:00,097
I will remain in the shadows.

524
00:45:02,266 --> 00:45:05,235
It will bring peace to my heart
if you promise me…

525
00:45:06,937 --> 00:45:10,107
that you will distance yourself
from misery,

526
00:45:12,176 --> 00:45:16,447
that you will continue embracing
the light in your life.

527
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:24,655
You are still young, Maria.

528
00:45:27,291 --> 00:45:30,127
That's why I am letting you go.

529
00:45:33,764 --> 00:45:36,967
I will give you peace.

530
00:45:41,872 --> 00:45:44,208
I wish you happiness.

531
00:45:48,312 --> 00:45:49,913
Farewell.

532
00:46:18,275 --> 00:46:19,643
I still love you.

533
00:46:19,710 --> 00:46:24,681
I don't know how I can bridge the time
and world between us.

534
00:46:24,748 --> 00:46:27,384
This is not a dream, Mother.

535
00:46:27,451 --> 00:46:29,953
Stop playing with me.

536
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:31,755
COMING UP

537
00:46:31,822 --> 00:46:34,291
There must be someone guarding
the forest and the lake.

538
00:46:34,358 --> 00:46:36,026
Let's not wait for daybreak.

539
00:46:37,661 --> 00:46:38,862
Fire!

540
00:46:39,763 --> 00:46:41,465
That was gunfire!

541
00:46:41,532 --> 00:46:43,534
Where is Sir Ibarra?

542
00:46:50,107 --> 00:46:52,509
