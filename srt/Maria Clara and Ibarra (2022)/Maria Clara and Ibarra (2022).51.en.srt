1
00:00:30,597 --> 00:00:34,234
MARIA CLARA AND IBARRA

2
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:38,238
THIS PROGRAM, WHICH IS ADAPTED
FROM THE NOVELS OF DR. JOSE P. RIZAL,

3
00:00:38,304 --> 00:00:42,375
IS PRESENTED USING DRAMATIC ELEMENTS
TO CONNECT THE PRESENT AND THE PAST

4
00:00:42,442 --> 00:00:46,379
IN A SPECIAL REIMAGINING OF THE NATIONAL
LITERATURE FILIPINOS ARE PROUD OF.

5
00:00:47,013 --> 00:00:49,282
<i>El Filibusterismo</i> by Jose Rizal.

6
00:00:49,349 --> 00:00:52,252
<i>Maria Clara will die in this story.</i>

7
00:00:52,318 --> 00:00:56,122
PREVIOUSLY…

8
00:00:56,189 --> 00:00:57,557
Maria!

9
00:00:57,624 --> 00:00:59,225
-You animal!
-What did you do?

10
00:00:59,292 --> 00:01:00,393
Monster!

11
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:02,495
<i>I have returned, my love.</i>

12
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:04,564
Ibarra…

13
00:01:06,466 --> 00:01:07,500
Maria!

14
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:08,768
Maria, I didn't mean to.

15
00:01:08,835 --> 00:01:11,237
Maria!

16
00:01:11,304 --> 00:01:13,706
<i>You are next, Ibarra.</i>

17
00:01:13,773 --> 00:01:15,442
Son of the devil...

18
00:01:16,709 --> 00:01:19,045
Change is what I'm after.

19
00:01:19,112 --> 00:01:20,747
The revolution of this country!

20
00:01:20,814 --> 00:01:24,651
Don't push through with your plan
because it won't have a good ending!

21
00:01:24,717 --> 00:01:26,319
It is written in the book!

22
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:32,992
<i>It's better if you take
that book back, Klay.</i>

23
00:01:33,059 --> 00:01:36,029
<i>Because more things have happened</i>

24
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:38,665
to that book since you gave it to me.

25
00:01:38,731 --> 00:01:44,170
This is the right time
for you to say goodbye...

26
00:01:44,237 --> 00:01:46,406
Crisostomo Ibarra?

27
00:01:46,473 --> 00:01:47,607
Until we meet again.

28
00:01:47,674 --> 00:01:52,445
The son of the devil has run out of love.

29
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:54,647
<i>I didn't make it.</i>

30
00:01:54,714 --> 00:01:57,083
<i>Captain Tiago's chapter already happened.</i>

31
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:59,052
<i>My condolences, Basilio.</i>

32
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:02,255
Because of that poison,
I lost my second father.

33
00:02:02,322 --> 00:02:03,857
Basilio said…

34
00:02:03,923 --> 00:02:07,260
What's written will reappear
if the event happens.

35
00:02:07,327 --> 00:02:09,796
So if it hasn't happened yet,
then it can be prevented?

36
00:02:09,863 --> 00:02:11,164
And it can still be changed.

37
00:02:11,231 --> 00:02:13,266
Why are you arresting me?
I didn't do anything wrong!

38
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:14,400
You are a bad person!

39
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:16,703
<i>This has something to do
with the building of the academy…</i>

40
00:02:16,769 --> 00:02:18,771
<i>But you aren't doing anything wrong.</i>

41
00:02:18,838 --> 00:02:20,039
I will get you out of here.

42
00:02:20,106 --> 00:02:22,442
Give me what I want.

43
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:24,844
In exchange for your beloved's freedom.

44
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:28,848
I'm not that kind of woman, Father!

45
00:02:28,915 --> 00:02:30,583
You are testing my patience!

46
00:02:31,951 --> 00:02:33,853
<i>-Basilio, Basilio!
-You're an animal!</i>

47
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,889
I will kill that demon!

48
00:02:35,955 --> 00:02:39,559
Padre Camorra will regret
what he did to Juli!

49
00:02:39,626 --> 00:02:40,960
Look after Juli.

50
00:02:41,027 --> 00:02:43,363
Basilio, don't go to Simoun!

51
00:02:43,429 --> 00:02:47,167
<i>The events in the novel</i>
<i>are slowly unfolding.</i>

52
00:02:47,233 --> 00:02:50,670
No matter what I try to do,
I can no longer change it!

53
00:02:51,437 --> 00:02:54,207
<i>I have made my decision, señor.
You are right.</i>

54
00:02:54,274 --> 00:02:55,975
It is time for revenge.

55
00:02:56,042 --> 00:02:59,279
And I will help you.
What is your plan, señor?

56
00:03:02,815 --> 00:03:04,450
This is my fault.

57
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:07,253
This is all my fault.

58
00:03:08,955 --> 00:03:10,223
Because I was too late.

59
00:03:13,726 --> 00:03:15,895
If only I was able to
convince all of you sooner,

60
00:03:15,962 --> 00:03:17,497
none of this would have happened!

61
00:03:18,998 --> 00:03:20,166
Right?

62
00:03:20,233 --> 00:03:21,534
Think about it…

63
00:03:21,601 --> 00:03:25,104
If I had convinced you sooner,
we could have saved Maria Clara's life.

64
00:03:26,105 --> 00:03:28,508
Then Sir Ibarra's heart
wouldn't have hardened as much.

65
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:32,245
If I was able to prevent the abuse

66
00:03:32,312 --> 00:03:34,814
that Juli went through,
then Basilio wouldn't be like this!

67
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:40,186
So, it's my fault! It's my fault!
I was too late!

68
00:03:41,621 --> 00:03:43,389
Klay…

69
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:45,558
Klay…

70
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,728
Klay…

71
00:03:50,029 --> 00:03:52,832
Don't blame it all on yourself.

72
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:57,937
You have faced
countless dangers just to save us.

73
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:02,809
And just today,
you saved Juli from the death

74
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:05,111
you said was written in the book, right?

75
00:04:10,516 --> 00:04:13,119
And you extended my life, miss.

76
00:04:26,299 --> 00:04:29,469
But, why… Why?

77
00:04:29,535 --> 00:04:32,272
Why is everything turning out this way?

78
00:04:32,338 --> 00:04:36,376
That kind-hearted Basilio
was completely taken over by his anger!

79
00:04:38,878 --> 00:04:42,048
I don't know.
I give up, I can't do this anymore.

80
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:49,522
Because I know the next chapters
will be more painful.

81
00:04:50,723 --> 00:04:54,227
Because there's something
I can still change, but won't be able to!

82
00:04:54,827 --> 00:04:57,196
Klay, didn't you say that
the story isn't over

83
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:02,835
until the last verse has been written
on the last page of the book?

84
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:06,773
Miss Klay…

85
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:08,641
Don't think

86
00:05:09,542 --> 00:05:12,979
that it is your sole responsibility
to save this story.

87
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:26,959
One person cannot change
the fate of a country.

88
00:05:27,026 --> 00:05:28,027
All of us…

89
00:05:28,895 --> 00:05:30,563
We can change this story.

90
00:05:31,064 --> 00:05:34,133
This country will decide when to stop

91
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:39,439
this intricate, abusive,
and painful story.

92
00:05:40,707 --> 00:05:43,843
So that change can happen.

93
00:05:56,389 --> 00:05:58,124
In a few days,

94
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:01,194
a wedding will take place…

95
00:06:01,828 --> 00:06:04,664
And high-class people
from all over Manila will attend.

96
00:06:06,232 --> 00:06:09,902
It will happen at the house
of Captain Tiago, which I will purchase.

97
00:06:11,938 --> 00:06:13,673
The stone house in Binondo?

98
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,744
The home of my Maria.

99
00:06:22,648 --> 00:06:28,721
The start of the revolution
against our enemies.

100
00:06:30,256 --> 00:06:31,824
This lamp…

101
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,230
will serve as the light that night.

102
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:46,706
<i>No one knows that the lamp
contains nitroglycerine.</i>

103
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:54,447
Nitroglycerine?

104
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:57,850
Dynamite?

105
00:06:57,917 --> 00:07:02,655
Mixed with hatred, tears…

106
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:09,328
injustice, and suffering.

107
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:14,033
<i>On that night,
those dangerous but ignorant tyrants,</i>

108
00:07:15,134 --> 00:07:20,573
<i>those irresponsible men,
those who hide behind God and the state,</i>

109
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:25,244
<i>they won't know
that they will all explode all at once.</i>

110
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:27,914
Boom!

111
00:07:30,716 --> 00:07:34,987
And all those evil bastards
who made our countrymen suffer…

112
00:07:36,489 --> 00:07:40,860
All of them will die together.

113
00:07:44,263 --> 00:07:48,534
This lamp's explosion will be the signal
for the revolutionaries to come out.

114
00:07:49,535 --> 00:07:53,940
<i>To meet with Tales
and fight the forces of this government.</i>

115
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:56,809
With Cabeza Tales?

116
00:07:59,045 --> 00:08:00,146
Juli's father?

117
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,883
<i>When the revolution starts,</i>

118
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:07,520
<i>the rest of the people
will be forced to fight,</i>

119
00:08:07,587 --> 00:08:14,560
<i>and you, Basilio, will lead them here
to get weapons.</i>

120
00:08:16,028 --> 00:08:18,731
But I don't know, señor.

121
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:23,436
Where would you need me
if you've already laid out your plans?

122
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:26,172
We will attack the enemy.

123
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:33,379
And whoever opposes the revolt
or refuses to take up weapons…

124
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:38,217
all of them will be killed.

125
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:41,254
All of them?

126
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:50,930
And anyone who doesn't
possess bravery and valor,

127
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:55,334
doesn't deserve
to be a part of our new race.

128
00:08:56,669 --> 00:09:01,440
A new race that won't produce
cowards and slaves.

129
00:09:03,109 --> 00:09:07,947
This will be the new Philippine islands.

130
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:41,614
Elias!

131
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,420
Show yourself, Elias.

132
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:17,383
You've really turned into a monster.

133
00:10:21,253 --> 00:10:23,456
Good evening to you too, Elias.

134
00:10:24,323 --> 00:10:25,424
Simoun…

135
00:10:26,058 --> 00:10:29,929
We didn't kill Father Salvi
and you know that!

136
00:10:30,997 --> 00:10:37,370
But according to authorities,
you and your lot did it.

137
00:10:37,436 --> 00:10:39,205
Because of your deception,

138
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:45,211
the civil guards keep arresting people!

139
00:10:47,013 --> 00:10:50,449
Most of them are innocent
and have nothing to do with this!

140
00:10:52,218 --> 00:10:54,020
Just think of all the mothers

141
00:10:55,388 --> 00:10:59,492
who now mourn their children and husbands!

142
00:10:59,558 --> 00:11:03,996
But that is necessary for change to begin.

143
00:11:04,797 --> 00:11:07,433
You have been truly possessed
by the devil.

144
00:11:09,135 --> 00:11:10,302
Tell me,

145
00:11:10,369 --> 00:11:12,905
did you have anything to do
with what happened to Matanglawin?

146
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:16,208
Were you the one who gave him weapons?

147
00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:21,747
He wasn't the only bandit
I've given weapons to.

148
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:28,854
It seems you have also
benefited from my gifts.

149
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:30,790
Simoun…

150
00:11:32,925 --> 00:11:34,593
I'll ask you one last time…

151
00:11:36,562 --> 00:11:38,130
Let us stop this!

152
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:43,069
None of you helped me,
so I looked for other allies.

153
00:11:44,737 --> 00:11:46,238
Now…

154
00:11:46,305 --> 00:11:47,339
Pull the trigger!

155
00:11:48,441 --> 00:11:49,341
Do it now.

156
00:11:50,776 --> 00:11:52,912
So that chaos will begin.

157
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:01,620
What are you waiting for?

158
00:12:03,189 --> 00:12:07,393
This rifle's trigger
fears innocent people.

159
00:12:09,795 --> 00:12:12,531
But I'm not scared
of pulling this trigger…

160
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:16,836
to kill an evil person like you!

161
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:27,513
Do you really think that
will stop all my plans, Elias?

162
00:12:28,681 --> 00:12:31,817
Everything is already laid out, Elias.

163
00:12:33,819 --> 00:12:35,621
So what are you waiting for?

164
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:02,381
You should be thankful
I'm not a demon like you!

165
00:14:00,239 --> 00:14:01,240
Klay.

166
00:14:03,309 --> 00:14:04,243
Juli.

167
00:14:04,877 --> 00:14:06,145
It's already dawn.

168
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:08,347
You can't sleep?

169
00:14:14,553 --> 00:14:17,857
Even if I close my eyes,
I can still see that demon.

170
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:22,328
It seems this life you saved
has become a punishment.

171
00:14:27,099 --> 00:14:30,402
That life is going to be a blessing

172
00:14:32,271 --> 00:14:35,507
once we've made that demon
pay for what he's done.

173
00:14:42,147 --> 00:14:43,716
Thank you, Klay,

174
00:14:44,817 --> 00:14:47,353
for keeping me and my grandfather
company tonight.

175
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:52,858
As long as we're here,

176
00:14:55,294 --> 00:14:57,196
I will always keep you company.

177
00:15:00,032 --> 00:15:04,536
I know the fear and pain you feel
will never go away, Juli.

178
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:12,311
But I know you can overcome it.

179
00:15:14,613 --> 00:15:18,884
You're going to have renewed strength
to fight back from all this.

180
00:15:23,822 --> 00:15:25,324
Even if it's hard…

181
00:15:28,727 --> 00:15:30,996
Even if you feel like giving up.

182
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,969
You must never ever give up on life.

183
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:44,343
It may be hard to believe,

184
00:15:45,811 --> 00:15:50,282
but do you know that your story
is written in a book?

185
00:15:52,918 --> 00:15:54,486
I don't understand.

186
00:15:57,089 --> 00:15:58,891
But if it is true…

187
00:15:59,758 --> 00:16:01,760
What does it say about
what's going to happen to me?

188
00:16:03,262 --> 00:16:05,197
How far will my story go?

189
00:16:13,772 --> 00:16:18,310
In the book,
you jumped from the church's tower.

190
00:16:21,013 --> 00:16:23,382
So your story ended in death.

191
00:16:29,121 --> 00:16:30,422
But look at you now…

192
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:33,926
You're here…

193
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:39,231
And very much alive.

194
00:16:41,266 --> 00:16:43,969
Because you chose not to give up earlier…

195
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:51,043
you were able to change your story.

196
00:16:55,814 --> 00:17:00,386
So, the next things
that will happen to you, depend on you.

197
00:17:05,624 --> 00:17:11,196
I believe you can stand back up again

198
00:17:12,731 --> 00:17:14,833
and continue your story.

199
00:17:16,735 --> 00:17:22,307
So you can have
so much hope and love in your heart.

200
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:28,180
Even if I do get back up, Klay…

201
00:17:30,516 --> 00:17:32,484
my whole being has been ruined.

202
00:17:34,486 --> 00:17:37,623
So I'm no longer deserving of Basilio.

203
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:41,860
Juli…

204
00:17:46,131 --> 00:17:47,132
Basilio?

205
00:18:02,481 --> 00:18:03,949
Please believe

206
00:18:06,018 --> 00:18:12,257
that nothing and no one

207
00:18:12,324 --> 00:18:16,929
can ruin the purity of your character.

208
00:18:19,898 --> 00:18:21,567
And no one

209
00:18:23,235 --> 00:18:24,736
can ever replace

210
00:18:26,004 --> 00:18:28,440
or hope to match you

211
00:18:29,575 --> 00:18:32,377
here in my heart.

212
00:18:37,649 --> 00:18:39,151
But where did you go?

213
00:18:42,387 --> 00:18:43,422
Is it true?

214
00:18:45,324 --> 00:18:47,926
I heard your conversation earlier.

215
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:52,631
You're going to join a revolution

216
00:18:52,698 --> 00:18:54,733
that señor Simoun planned?

217
00:18:58,704 --> 00:19:00,139
-Basilio…
-Basilio.

218
00:19:01,673 --> 00:19:02,608
I beg you…

219
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:07,346
Think carefully about
your desire to help him.

220
00:19:08,413 --> 00:19:11,617
He's already been blinded by his anger
so don't be like him!

221
00:19:13,886 --> 00:19:16,188
We should not talk
about this anymore, Klay.

222
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:22,294
Where is Grandfather Selo?
I need to greet him first.

223
00:19:22,861 --> 00:19:26,431
Basilio, don't ignore me.
Let's talk about this.

224
00:19:27,399 --> 00:19:29,268
There's nothing to talk about, Klay.

225
00:19:32,704 --> 00:19:34,406
My decision is final.

226
00:19:35,641 --> 00:19:39,778
And no one can change that.

227
00:19:40,946 --> 00:19:41,780
Juli…

228
00:19:43,649 --> 00:19:44,516
Let's go.

229
00:20:15,414 --> 00:20:17,950
Basilio has completely submitted
to Simoun.

230
00:20:20,686 --> 00:20:24,856
Miss Klay tried to stop him,
but he was stubborn.

231
00:20:25,424 --> 00:20:26,925
He didn't want to listen.

232
00:20:26,992 --> 00:20:29,461
He didn't even want Juli
to talk to him about it.

233
00:20:29,528 --> 00:20:31,096
Where is the young man now?

234
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:34,633
We think he went back to Simoun

235
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:38,070
to execute his plan,
which Klay mentioned to us.

236
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:42,174
The lamp…

237
00:20:46,979 --> 00:20:48,714
The gentleman's purpose is clear.

238
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:54,720
The oppressed will fight back
against the force of the oppressors.

239
00:20:55,854 --> 00:20:57,422
So you must join us.

240
00:21:06,498 --> 00:21:10,836
They said this was the place
they used to hold feasts and gatherings.

241
00:21:13,572 --> 00:21:16,074
But this place has been neglected
with the passing of time.

242
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:20,579
But with a bit of cleaning and decorating,

243
00:21:22,047 --> 00:21:24,716
this place will be as it was before.

244
00:21:29,054 --> 00:21:30,889
I assure you, Basilio,

245
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:35,560
an explosion of color
will once again grace this house.

246
00:21:48,173 --> 00:21:51,610
Can you please check downstairs
if Señor Quiroga has arrived?

247
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:57,249
Yes, señor.

248
00:22:54,606 --> 00:22:56,708
I have come home to you, Maria.

249
00:23:05,016 --> 00:23:07,319
We will have our revenge, Maria.

250
00:23:10,489 --> 00:23:13,024
They will all die.

251
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:22,200
I will kill them all.

252
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:41,953
I seem very fortunate
to have come home and found you here.

253
00:23:43,188 --> 00:23:46,992
Especially the friend I want to be with
in this revolution.

254
00:23:49,227 --> 00:23:50,295
Revolution?

255
00:23:51,029 --> 00:23:53,165
Where Simoun has you by the neck?

256
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:56,835
With all due respect, my friend,

257
00:23:57,669 --> 00:24:01,706
but didn't Simoun have a hand
in the suffering of the oppressed?

258
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:05,644
He is just toying with you
in the palm of his hands.

259
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:09,981
The important thing is that
the revolution happens.

260
00:24:10,048 --> 00:24:13,752
But the real revolution
is not just revenge

261
00:24:14,553 --> 00:24:18,323
or a gathering of those
fraught with hatred,

262
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:22,294
it must come from a burning desire
to free our country!

263
00:24:23,195 --> 00:24:28,733
A country that fights
all kinds of oppression and oppressors.

264
00:24:29,768 --> 00:24:34,005
It is a union of people
whose hearts are filled with hope.

265
00:24:34,573 --> 00:24:38,610
I don't know what or who
your friends are talking about.

266
00:24:40,745 --> 00:24:44,549
Does this mean you won't join us?

267
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:56,561
My friend, the change we need
is the one that betters our country,

268
00:24:57,529 --> 00:25:00,131
a country that was oppressed and enslaved.

269
00:25:01,466 --> 00:25:03,768
Not one that will give birth to monsters.

270
00:25:06,071 --> 00:25:09,508
Forgive me, but those
who won't join, will die.

271
00:25:13,712 --> 00:25:14,713
Father!

272
00:25:41,139 --> 00:25:42,274
Forgive me, my child.

273
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:45,210
But this is the revolution we need.

274
00:25:45,277 --> 00:25:47,512
This is what we need so I can avenge you

275
00:25:47,579 --> 00:25:49,447
and take back
everything they stole from us!

276
00:25:50,015 --> 00:25:52,317
But what kind of revolution
are you getting into, Father?

277
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:57,622
One where you kill those who oppose you?

278
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:02,427
Even if they are good
and they saved my life?

279
00:26:05,096 --> 00:26:06,031
If that is so,

280
00:26:06,965 --> 00:26:10,468
how are you different
from our conquerors who call us <i>Indios</i>?

281
00:26:13,171 --> 00:26:16,608
How are you different
from those who exploit us?

282
00:26:20,512 --> 00:26:23,882
How are you different
from the devil who violated me?

283
00:26:30,622 --> 00:26:32,290
We have run out of time.

284
00:26:33,992 --> 00:26:34,859
What about Klay?

285
00:26:35,694 --> 00:26:39,698
She is probably still traveling
with Hernando to Manila.

286
00:26:39,764 --> 00:26:42,734
In that case, let us gather our comrades
and follow them.

287
00:26:43,802 --> 00:26:47,305
My friends, we can still change this.

288
00:26:47,372 --> 00:26:51,176
Let us do everything to save
and bring Crisostomo Ibarra back to us.

289
00:26:53,511 --> 00:26:56,047
We must go. We have a wedding to attend.

290
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:16,968
Long live the newlyweds!

291
00:27:17,035 --> 00:27:19,371
-Long live the newlyweds!
-Long live the newlyweds!

292
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:31,249
-Long live!
-Long live!

293
00:28:16,828 --> 00:28:20,331
Beautiful, Señor Simoun!

294
00:28:20,398 --> 00:28:24,269
Allowing us to use his house
as a venue for this celebration

295
00:28:24,335 --> 00:28:26,204
is more than enough.

296
00:28:26,271 --> 00:28:29,974
And he even has a gift.

297
00:28:31,943 --> 00:28:37,716
The newlyweds are so lucky
to have him as their godfather.

298
00:28:38,283 --> 00:28:39,584
Yes, it's true.

299
00:28:39,651 --> 00:28:40,719
Yes.

300
00:28:40,785 --> 00:28:44,856
But where is the Brown Cardinal?

301
00:28:46,291 --> 00:28:50,829
Ah, have you seen our gift
for the newlyweds?

302
00:28:54,499 --> 00:29:00,071
So shiny, such shimmer, how splendid…

303
00:29:00,138 --> 00:29:01,940
Captain Basilio!

304
00:29:02,006 --> 00:29:04,109
-Thank you so much!
-Thank you.

305
00:29:04,175 --> 00:29:07,378
Good afternoon, Captain General!

306
00:29:07,946 --> 00:29:09,314
Oh, well then!

307
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:12,417
Why don't we have the newlyweds dance?

308
00:29:12,484 --> 00:29:14,652
-Let the newlyweds dance!
-Yes.

309
00:29:14,719 --> 00:29:17,856
-Long live the newlyweds!
-Cheers!

310
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:19,824
Long live the newlyweds!

311
00:30:10,241 --> 00:30:13,111
Thank you, my friends. Thank you!

312
00:30:37,202 --> 00:30:38,703
I already warned you.

313
00:30:39,904 --> 00:30:41,773
Don't meddle.

314
00:30:45,543 --> 00:30:46,811
You know me, señor.

315
00:30:48,413 --> 00:30:49,781
I always meddle.

316
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:56,020
Señor Simoun has not come down yet.

317
00:30:58,523 --> 00:31:01,860
That means he hasn't left the lamp yet.

318
00:31:03,628 --> 00:31:05,730
Klay and Fidel should be here by now.

319
00:31:06,397 --> 00:31:08,032
I have a bad feeling about this.

320
00:31:08,099 --> 00:31:10,101
We don't know what's happening.

321
00:31:10,168 --> 00:31:13,705
If we attack now,
there are only a few of us.

322
00:31:13,771 --> 00:31:17,008
We aren't even sure if the house is
surrounded by civil guards.

323
00:31:18,243 --> 00:31:19,143
Basilio?

324
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,414
Isagani…

325
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:25,817
What are you doing here?

326
00:31:28,186 --> 00:31:30,188
You should leave now, Isagani.

327
00:31:31,422 --> 00:31:32,757
Have you gone inside already?

328
00:31:33,324 --> 00:31:34,592
Come on, Isagani.

329
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,895
I'll take you home.

330
00:31:36,961 --> 00:31:39,030
Help me get inside, Basilio.

331
00:31:40,832 --> 00:31:45,403
I only wish to see Paulita one last time.

332
00:31:46,471 --> 00:31:48,139
You can't go inside.

333
00:31:48,806 --> 00:31:51,276
Why are you preventing me too?

334
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:53,511
Get out of here now…

335
00:31:55,513 --> 00:32:00,418
Because my plans are about to begin.

336
00:32:02,687 --> 00:32:03,755
You won't succeed.

337
00:32:05,023 --> 00:32:07,325
The lamp won't explode.

338
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:11,996
Even if I don't meddle,

339
00:32:12,063 --> 00:32:16,301
your Spanish friends will still find out
that you are actually their enemy.

340
00:32:21,339 --> 00:32:23,641
And they will find out about your plans.

341
00:32:24,809 --> 00:32:26,511
That's what is written in the book.

342
00:32:26,577 --> 00:32:28,479
So that's what will happen.

343
00:32:29,847 --> 00:32:34,218
So, if I don't meddle,
your plan will fail.

344
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:36,287
And you will die.

345
00:32:37,822 --> 00:32:40,591
Enough with that book!

346
00:32:41,592 --> 00:32:42,827
Go home, Isagani.

347
00:32:43,394 --> 00:32:44,629
You might get dragged into this.

348
00:32:44,696 --> 00:32:46,297
It's dangerous here.

349
00:32:46,364 --> 00:32:49,334
You're only saying that because
you think I'm here to cause a scene. But…

350
00:32:52,704 --> 00:32:53,671
I'm not.

351
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:57,508
I only wish to see her.

352
00:32:57,575 --> 00:33:00,345
So, my friend, please.

353
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:03,514
Help me.

354
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:07,518
Goodbye.

355
00:33:08,419 --> 00:33:09,420
My friend…

356
00:33:11,189 --> 00:33:12,357
To sate your hunger.

357
00:33:13,524 --> 00:33:14,359
There is still time…

358
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:20,431
You can still choose to change.

359
00:33:21,399 --> 00:33:22,834
Choose to change.

360
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:26,804
I know you. You're a good person.

361
00:33:27,972 --> 00:33:29,807
You have a kind heart.

362
00:33:34,412 --> 00:33:35,980
<i>Listen to me carefully.</i>

363
00:33:36,047 --> 00:33:38,616
You can't go inside!

364
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:40,051
Isagani…

365
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:44,989
The moment the lamp inside is lit…

366
00:33:45,056 --> 00:33:47,158
What lamp are you talking about?

367
00:33:47,725 --> 00:33:50,128
Señor Simoun's gift to the newlyweds.

368
00:33:53,131 --> 00:33:55,733
The lamp will explode…

369
00:33:56,834 --> 00:33:58,703
And everyone will die.

370
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:02,673
So, Isagani, if you still value your life…

371
00:34:03,674 --> 00:34:05,243
Get out of here now!

372
00:34:05,309 --> 00:34:06,244
Now!

373
00:34:07,311 --> 00:34:08,179
Let's go!

374
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:10,348
Isagani, let's go!

375
00:34:10,948 --> 00:34:13,918
-Let go of me!
-Isagani, Isagani!

376
00:34:15,787 --> 00:34:17,188
It's time.

377
00:34:22,293 --> 00:34:24,695
The lamp's light is fading. Servant!

378
00:34:25,763 --> 00:34:28,699
Servant, fix the light of the lamp!

379
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:32,570
The lamp!

380
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:34,172
Isagani?

381
00:34:34,939 --> 00:34:36,541
Isagani, no.

382
00:34:42,113 --> 00:34:44,649
The lamp! It's going to explode!

383
00:34:44,715 --> 00:34:46,150
Everyone, get out!

384
00:34:46,217 --> 00:34:48,653
What? Señor Simoun's lamp?

385
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:50,154
Yes!

386
00:34:50,221 --> 00:34:53,724
The Brown Cardinal
will blow up this celebration!

387
00:34:53,791 --> 00:34:55,259
Hurry! Get out!

388
00:34:55,893 --> 00:34:58,329
-Hurry!
-Everyone, stop!

389
00:34:59,063 --> 00:35:00,965
You are a traitor!

390
00:35:01,566 --> 00:35:02,533
Go ahead…

391
00:35:04,135 --> 00:35:05,136
Shoot!

392
00:35:06,704 --> 00:35:09,207
So that we all die together.

393
00:35:18,649 --> 00:35:21,919
Numbered, weighed, divided…

394
00:35:22,587 --> 00:35:24,956
Your days are numbered!

395
00:35:26,424 --> 00:35:28,059
Heavens, Señor Simoun!

396
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:30,595
It seems like the devil
is on your shoulder!

397
00:35:30,661 --> 00:35:34,432
You are the devils who have been
making this country suffer for so long!

398
00:35:34,932 --> 00:35:36,400
That is enough, señor!

399
00:35:38,169 --> 00:35:41,606
Señor Crisostomo, that is enough!

400
00:36:02,193 --> 00:36:06,230
Take a good look at the face…

401
00:36:07,031 --> 00:36:08,799
of the person you persecuted!

402
00:36:08,866 --> 00:36:10,334
It's Crisostomo!

403
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:12,403
Impossible!

404
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:15,039
This is impossible!

405
00:36:15,106 --> 00:36:18,743
You've been dead for a long time! My God!

406
00:36:19,944 --> 00:36:21,546
The late Father Salvi was right.

407
00:36:22,647 --> 00:36:24,015
You are a fake!

408
00:36:24,081 --> 00:36:25,683
You are a fake!

409
00:36:30,488 --> 00:36:35,760
You two, leave now
if you don't want us all to die here!

410
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:37,795
We aren't going anywhere.

411
00:36:39,897 --> 00:36:41,966
We aren't leaving you, my friend.

412
00:36:43,267 --> 00:36:47,171
If we don't break into the house now,
our friends may die.

413
00:36:47,738 --> 00:36:50,641
Our forces aren't enough to beat them.

414
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:51,943
We're joining you!

415
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:55,112
Cabeza Tales!

416
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:56,547
Juli!

417
00:37:01,485 --> 00:37:05,122
In that case, we will all die.

418
00:37:05,189 --> 00:37:06,524
Then so be it.

419
00:37:08,359 --> 00:37:09,360
Is that what you want?

420
00:37:12,463 --> 00:37:14,699
Is this the revenge you want?

421
00:37:17,835 --> 00:37:19,971
Is this the revolution
you're referring to?

422
00:37:22,373 --> 00:37:25,142
All the wickedness
in this country won't stop

423
00:37:25,209 --> 00:37:27,011
if all of us are going to die!

424
00:37:31,015 --> 00:37:31,983
My friend…

425
00:37:33,851 --> 00:37:34,852
You are right.

426
00:37:35,853 --> 00:37:39,190
Let us give back the power
to the people, the right way.

427
00:37:40,391 --> 00:37:41,959
You too, Juli?

428
00:37:42,026 --> 00:37:45,263
A few people won't be able
to change our country's story.

429
00:37:45,329 --> 00:37:46,764
That's why I'm coming with you.

430
00:37:49,867 --> 00:37:51,569
We're coming with you too!

431
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:53,971
Brother!

432
00:38:05,416 --> 00:38:06,517
Pablito.

433
00:38:07,685 --> 00:38:08,786
My friend.

434
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:12,523
In that case, let's go.

435
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:28,472
Look at all of us, señor.

436
00:38:32,943 --> 00:38:36,247
You only see those monsters here.

437
00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:43,521
But many innocent people will be involved.

438
00:38:48,626 --> 00:38:52,863
They aren't like the people
you despise so much.

439
00:38:57,101 --> 00:39:01,238
A lot of us did you no wrong!
We didn't even mistreat you!

440
00:39:02,573 --> 00:39:04,742
We aren't bad people.

441
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:07,511
Go ahead…

442
00:39:08,746 --> 00:39:10,414
Take a good look at all of us!

443
00:39:11,549 --> 00:39:14,985
And tell me
if we all really deserve to die.

444
00:39:21,792 --> 00:39:23,327
<i>If I can dream bigger,</i>

445
00:39:23,394 --> 00:39:26,130
then I can include my mother in it.

446
00:39:28,332 --> 00:39:32,570
Me, my mother, and Crispin,
alive and free.

447
00:39:32,636 --> 00:39:38,175
I promise you, Basilio,
I will help you live your dreams.

448
00:39:39,810 --> 00:39:43,681
But make sure to study
and be good to your family.

449
00:39:46,884 --> 00:39:49,920
My father believed
that education is the only way

450
00:39:49,987 --> 00:39:52,056
to enlightenment and progress.

451
00:39:52,123 --> 00:39:54,125
In that case, Crisostomo,
may I also teach there?

452
00:39:54,191 --> 00:39:57,395
Just like the nuns at the convent.

453
00:39:57,461 --> 00:40:01,432
They teach us too! Like music.

454
00:40:01,499 --> 00:40:05,436
Music is a big thing for a child, and…

455
00:40:07,104 --> 00:40:09,774
It will broaden their imagination.

456
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:13,511
And they will have
a happier disposition in life.

457
00:40:15,646 --> 00:40:17,782
Because, just like arts,

458
00:40:17,848 --> 00:40:22,153
music develops the mind of a child.

459
00:40:35,833 --> 00:40:37,935
It seems there's no escaping for me now.

460
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:43,808
So take a good look at me!

461
00:40:45,609 --> 00:40:46,977
Because I…

462
00:40:48,345 --> 00:40:51,182
am the real son of the devil!

463
00:40:51,248 --> 00:40:52,383
I became a monster!

464
00:40:57,054 --> 00:41:02,259
A person whose father was disrespected,
whose dignity was taken away…

465
00:41:04,695 --> 00:41:05,796
Someone who was kept away…

466
00:41:07,898 --> 00:41:13,103
and denied a life
with the woman he truly loved…

467
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:21,212
When she disappeared,
a monster came to life.

468
00:41:21,745 --> 00:41:23,848
A monster filled with so much hatred.

469
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:29,053
A monster who's no different

470
00:41:30,554 --> 00:41:33,090
from those who were persecuting me

471
00:41:34,024 --> 00:41:35,793
for a very long time.

472
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:44,435
It turns out that I…

473
00:41:46,303 --> 00:41:52,276
have made this cancer
in our country even worse.

474
00:41:55,779 --> 00:41:57,681
Arrest that traitor!

475
00:41:57,748 --> 00:41:59,450
And take the lamp away!

476
00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:01,151
Arrest all the bandits!

477
00:42:01,719 --> 00:42:03,053
Don't arrest them!

478
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:07,258
I'm the only one who's at fault here
and I'm the only poison of this country!

479
00:42:07,324 --> 00:42:08,993
-Let go of me!
-Imprison these rebels!

480
00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:14,999
Set them free!

481
00:42:17,301 --> 00:42:19,703
Miss, set the innocent people free.

482
00:42:23,974 --> 00:42:25,409
Nobody move!

483
00:42:33,017 --> 00:42:34,318
Drop your weapons.

484
00:42:40,491 --> 00:42:42,226
Take the innocent out of here.

485
00:42:42,293 --> 00:42:43,727
Do it now.

486
00:42:43,794 --> 00:42:45,195
Doña, come on!

487
00:42:45,262 --> 00:42:46,497
-Come on, everyone!
-Hurry!

488
00:42:47,064 --> 00:42:48,632
-Come on!
-Hurry!

489
00:42:48,699 --> 00:42:50,868
-Come on!
-Hurry!

490
00:42:50,935 --> 00:42:52,202
-Hurry!
-Be careful!

491
00:42:52,269 --> 00:42:54,705
-Let's go! Hurry!
-Come on!

492
00:42:54,772 --> 00:42:56,540
Let's go, everyone! Hurry!

493
00:42:57,174 --> 00:42:59,777
-Hurry! Let's go!
-Let's go!

494
00:42:59,843 --> 00:43:01,011
Hurry!

495
00:43:01,078 --> 00:43:02,112
Please! Hurry!

496
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:03,547
Out.

497
00:43:05,149 --> 00:43:06,216
Out!

498
00:44:01,939 --> 00:44:03,207
Juli...

499
00:44:08,379 --> 00:44:09,713
Where is he?

500
00:45:14,078 --> 00:45:15,279
You drank it?

501
00:45:22,119 --> 00:45:23,220
Why did you do that?

502
00:45:32,863 --> 00:45:33,831
Señor!

503
00:45:35,699 --> 00:45:37,167
Señor, stay with us.

504
00:45:37,234 --> 00:45:39,136
Señor, señor, stay with us.

505
00:45:39,203 --> 00:45:40,471
I will treat you, señor!

506
00:45:43,207 --> 00:45:45,275
You don't need to save me anymore.

507
00:45:49,113 --> 00:45:53,083
But you can still save this country.

508
00:45:54,418 --> 00:45:55,285
No, sir.

509
00:45:55,352 --> 00:45:57,387
Just stay with us, you will still live.

510
00:45:59,857 --> 00:46:01,859
To live or to die…

511
00:46:04,361 --> 00:46:06,096
Perhaps it is better for me to die…

512
00:46:08,532 --> 00:46:10,467
in the house of my beloved.

513
00:46:12,269 --> 00:46:14,972
Sir, this is a different kind of surprise.

514
00:46:20,477 --> 00:46:25,182
There is no forgiveness
for the things I have done.

515
00:46:30,454 --> 00:46:32,055
There is no forgiveness…

516
00:46:33,557 --> 00:46:37,528
for the oppression I did
to you who are oppressed.

517
00:46:41,231 --> 00:46:42,566
But my thanks to all of you…

518
00:46:44,067 --> 00:46:48,772
because you didn't give up
on bringing back the real me.

519
00:46:50,607 --> 00:46:51,942
My true self.

520
00:46:54,211 --> 00:46:55,979
I will leave this world…

521
00:46:57,681 --> 00:46:59,216
as Crisostomo.

522
00:47:04,087 --> 00:47:06,757
Is that possible, Father?

523
00:47:07,758 --> 00:47:13,063
The Lord will have mercy on those
who have been astray but came back to Him.

524
00:47:21,572 --> 00:47:22,673
Finally…

525
00:47:24,575 --> 00:47:26,143
you have come back, my friend.

526
00:47:27,711 --> 00:47:28,879
You came back.

527
00:47:29,746 --> 00:47:31,648
Even though it is painful

528
00:47:33,517 --> 00:47:35,118
for you to leave us again…

529
00:47:37,254 --> 00:47:38,522
my friend.

530
00:47:40,891 --> 00:47:43,293
Thank you very much, my friend.

531
00:47:45,062 --> 00:47:46,964
You didn't give up on me.

532
00:47:47,865 --> 00:47:49,099
Even though…

533
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:54,304
Klay…

534
00:47:58,375 --> 00:47:59,643
Forgive me.

535
00:48:01,612 --> 00:48:07,017
If I was the poison
of the written world you came into.

536
00:48:11,655 --> 00:48:14,658
But this poison will now disappear…

537
00:48:16,526 --> 00:48:17,628
so that…

538
00:48:19,930 --> 00:48:22,266
he won't infect anyone anymore.

539
00:48:30,173 --> 00:48:32,009
You aren't the enemy…

540
00:48:34,745 --> 00:48:37,848
and you aren't the poison you believe.

541
00:48:39,416 --> 00:48:43,420
Because like the Crisostomo Ibarra
we have come to know…

542
00:48:46,089 --> 00:48:50,527
in the end,
you still chose to do the right thing

543
00:48:50,594 --> 00:48:52,496
even if it is difficult.

544
00:48:55,265 --> 00:48:57,768
You can still change the story, sir.

545
00:49:01,672 --> 00:49:02,973
And in your version,

546
00:49:04,641 --> 00:49:07,978
you will be together again in paradise.

547
00:49:09,646 --> 00:49:11,148
Wherever it may be.

548
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:22,125
<i>If you really cannot
give up on our oath, on our love,</i>

549
00:49:22,192 --> 00:49:25,095
<i>then perhaps I must also</i>
<i>not give up on it.</i>

550
00:49:25,162 --> 00:49:27,631
<i>Even if it takes seven more years,
over and over again,</i>

551
00:49:28,665 --> 00:49:30,367
<i>I will wait for you, Crisostomo.</i>

552
00:51:35,192 --> 00:51:38,195
It seems today is the day for goodbyes.

553
00:51:42,899 --> 00:51:45,102
But before I bid my farewell…

554
00:51:51,908 --> 00:51:53,410
Father Florentino…

555
00:51:55,479 --> 00:52:01,751
We trust that you will always
let goodness and faith in God prevail.

556
00:52:03,386 --> 00:52:07,224
That is why we will
let you decide what to do

557
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:09,826
with the last remaining
jewelry of Sir Ibarra.

558
00:52:20,570 --> 00:52:22,139
Thank you so much, Miss Klay.

559
00:52:24,441 --> 00:52:29,279
I accept this task and responsibility.

560
00:52:35,352 --> 00:52:36,520
I guess this is it.

561
00:52:38,788 --> 00:52:40,090
It's the end.

562
00:52:46,429 --> 00:52:49,499
Thank you so much, Father Florentino.

563
00:52:52,502 --> 00:52:53,737
Isagani.

564
00:52:55,672 --> 00:52:58,108
We will never forget you, Miss Klay.

565
00:53:32,242 --> 00:53:33,743
Me too, Lucia.

566
00:53:36,112 --> 00:53:41,418
You are one of the first people here
who showed me kindness.

567
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:46,856
And you proved that women aren't weak.

568
00:53:48,758 --> 00:53:50,527
Even during this time period.

569
00:54:04,808 --> 00:54:07,611
I wish that all fathers were like you.

570
00:54:12,449 --> 00:54:14,884
Juli is very lucky to have you.

571
00:54:15,986 --> 00:54:18,722
Because you are always there for her.

572
00:54:19,889 --> 00:54:23,760
Thank you for saving us.

573
00:54:25,895 --> 00:54:26,863
Don't worry…

574
00:54:28,031 --> 00:54:31,501
I will take care of Juli and Basilio.

575
00:54:38,041 --> 00:54:39,276
Basilio.

576
00:54:42,445 --> 00:54:43,346
Juli.

577
00:54:44,948 --> 00:54:49,286
Young people like you
are the hope of this country.

578
00:54:50,954 --> 00:54:56,526
You who went through
so much pain and suffering,

579
00:54:59,129 --> 00:55:04,100
but continue to show
strength and kindness.

580
00:55:10,073 --> 00:55:14,911
I hope you can prove
that love can still prevail

581
00:55:14,978 --> 00:55:17,280
even in the midst of a wounded nation.

582
00:55:20,216 --> 00:55:22,085
Thank you for everything, Klay.

583
00:55:48,712 --> 00:55:49,979
Juli…

584
00:56:13,436 --> 00:56:14,337
Elias…

585
00:56:17,907 --> 00:56:20,310
Did you know that my brother
was named after you?

586
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:29,119
And did you know that Rizal
regretted killing you in the first book?

587
00:56:30,687 --> 00:56:32,522
Now I know why.

588
00:56:34,891 --> 00:56:37,160
You are truly amazing, sir.

589
00:56:39,195 --> 00:56:43,566
You are the true face of this revolution.

590
00:56:55,311 --> 00:56:56,312
Miss…

591
00:56:57,147 --> 00:56:59,582
Know that I will continue this fight

592
00:57:01,284 --> 00:57:05,588
even after you leave, my sister.

593
00:57:30,980 --> 00:57:33,950
We are all brothers and sisters.

594
00:57:35,018 --> 00:57:36,352
Long live…

595
00:57:36,419 --> 00:57:37,854
The nation's children!

596
00:57:38,621 --> 00:57:43,092
-Long live!
-Long live!

597
00:57:44,127 --> 00:57:46,763
Live long, Klay.

598
00:57:57,006 --> 00:57:58,308
Oh! Wait, wait.

599
00:58:05,782 --> 00:58:07,283
Nice, there's still some battery left.

600
00:58:08,117 --> 00:58:09,219
Ah, find your place.

601
00:58:09,285 --> 00:58:11,788
Let's move closer to Father Florentino.

602
00:58:13,056 --> 00:58:14,190
Hurry!

603
00:58:14,257 --> 00:58:15,925
Hurry, we'll take
a group picture together!

604
00:58:16,726 --> 00:58:17,760
What's that?

605
00:58:19,329 --> 00:58:20,897
We'll take a photograph.

606
00:58:24,033 --> 00:58:24,968
There!

607
00:58:27,237 --> 00:58:29,572
One, two, three.

608
00:58:33,409 --> 00:58:34,277
One more.

609
00:58:34,344 --> 00:58:35,345
Let's say, "long live"!

610
00:58:35,411 --> 00:58:36,946
One, two, three!

611
00:58:37,013 --> 00:58:38,381
Long live!

612
00:58:38,948 --> 00:58:39,983
There!

613
00:59:00,470 --> 00:59:03,306
Many, many thanks to all of you.

614
00:59:06,609 --> 00:59:08,177
I love you all so much.

615
00:59:23,026 --> 00:59:24,193
Where is Fidel?

616
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:32,068
Hold on, okay?

617
00:59:45,815 --> 00:59:47,350
Are you looking for Fidel?

618
00:59:51,154 --> 00:59:52,555
Mr. To…

619
00:59:56,259 --> 00:59:59,662
Please stop. That's a bad joke.

620
00:59:59,729 --> 01:00:02,699
Don't tell me you're Ali and you're also…

621
01:00:02,765 --> 01:00:04,167
Do I look like Fidel?

622
01:00:11,608 --> 01:00:13,509
Sir, I'm sorry, okay?

623
01:00:14,744 --> 01:00:17,246
I stole the book and then…

624
01:00:17,313 --> 01:00:19,082
I expected that from you.

625
01:00:20,116 --> 01:00:21,751
But the story is finished now.

626
01:00:22,385 --> 01:00:25,021
I'm here to take you home, okay?

627
01:00:25,755 --> 01:00:26,756
No, ah...

628
01:00:26,823 --> 01:00:28,958
Please wait one moment.
I'm waiting for Fidel.

629
01:00:29,025 --> 01:00:33,196
Have you guessed
what his role in the story is?

630
01:00:36,232 --> 01:00:38,234
Because it looks like
he hasn't figured it out yet.

631
01:01:14,871 --> 01:01:16,272
Fidel…

632
01:01:16,339 --> 01:01:18,474
Just a moment, Miss Klay.

633
01:01:20,076 --> 01:01:23,913
Maybe my name is written on the last page.

634
01:01:25,081 --> 01:01:26,582
Maybe it's at the very end.

635
01:01:39,362 --> 01:01:41,097
Maybe it's not really there.

636
01:01:47,270 --> 01:01:48,604
If so, then why?

637
01:01:52,642 --> 01:01:54,577
What was Rizal's reason?

638
01:01:55,211 --> 01:01:57,980
Why didn't he include my name in the book?

639
01:01:59,916 --> 01:02:02,051
Klay, why am I not a part of it?

640
01:02:12,662 --> 01:02:14,997
Fidel…

641
01:02:19,368 --> 01:02:20,603
Take a look.

642
01:02:25,908 --> 01:02:28,144
That's your character description
that I found.

643
01:02:36,052 --> 01:02:37,854
A friend of

644
01:02:39,722 --> 01:02:41,090
Crisostomo Ibarra…

645
01:02:44,927 --> 01:02:47,196
who has a clownish personality.

646
01:02:50,099 --> 01:02:51,634
And the…

647
01:02:51,701 --> 01:02:55,872
And the name used there is the name…

648
01:02:58,107 --> 01:03:01,210
the name other people used to call me
back then in the seminary.

649
01:03:06,949 --> 01:03:08,618
Are you kidding me, Miss Klay?

650
01:03:09,685 --> 01:03:12,855
No. Okay, let's just drop it.

651
01:03:15,591 --> 01:03:20,463
This is the only character I found
who could be you.

652
01:03:24,734 --> 01:03:26,569
I actually wonder too,

653
01:03:26,636 --> 01:03:29,572
because his role wasn't
this big in the first novel.

654
01:03:52,395 --> 01:03:54,630
Maybe that's because of you, Miss Klay?

655
01:03:58,367 --> 01:04:00,870
Maybe, when you entered our world…

656
01:04:03,673 --> 01:04:05,842
It seems that my character

657
01:04:06,976 --> 01:04:12,114
has become more than just
words and letters on paper.

658
01:04:17,153 --> 01:04:18,754
That's because of you, Miss Klay.

659
01:04:22,758 --> 01:04:24,260
Because of you,

660
01:04:26,095 --> 01:04:28,931
I played a bigger role in this world.

661
01:04:37,607 --> 01:04:40,476
Because of the role you played…

662
01:04:47,083 --> 01:04:49,485
I was able to survive in this world.

663
01:04:54,023 --> 01:04:55,858
Because of all your love…

664
01:04:58,628 --> 01:05:00,696
Because of your love.

665
01:05:12,842 --> 01:05:15,378
And now that I need to leave
one more time…

666
01:05:20,049 --> 01:05:22,385
I cannot bear to leave you behind again.

667
01:05:25,755 --> 01:05:28,457
I cannot bear for us to be apart anymore.

668
01:05:32,361 --> 01:05:33,596
Klay…

669
01:05:37,466 --> 01:05:38,834
Come with me.

670
01:05:41,537 --> 01:05:44,040
Come home with me to my world, Fidel.

671
01:06:26,615 --> 01:06:28,484
Who will take care of your kids?

672
01:06:28,551 --> 01:06:29,685
Of our kid?

673
01:06:29,752 --> 01:06:31,287
Who else would love you?

674
01:06:31,354 --> 01:06:35,624
I don't care if I cannot find
a man who will love me!

675
01:06:35,691 --> 01:06:38,027
The love of my children is enough.

676
01:06:38,094 --> 01:06:39,562
I don't want this anymore.

677
01:06:39,628 --> 01:06:42,098
I can no longer endure being with you!

678
01:06:42,164 --> 01:06:44,834
-I think this is yours.
-Oh, sorry…

679
01:06:45,334 --> 01:06:46,936
<i>Maria Clara's necklace…</i>

680
01:06:47,003 --> 01:06:49,271
Are you having a hard time?
Do you need money?

681
01:06:49,338 --> 01:06:50,639
No, I'm not.

682
01:06:50,706 --> 01:06:52,808
I need to tell you…

683
01:06:52,875 --> 01:06:54,510
COMING UP…

684
01:06:54,577 --> 01:06:55,911
…that I don't need you.

685
01:06:55,978 --> 01:06:57,079
What?

686
01:06:57,146 --> 01:06:59,582
<i>Would you know where Mr. Torres is?</i>

687
01:06:59,648 --> 01:07:01,784
<i>Oh, Mr. Torres is no longer here.</i>

688
01:07:01,851 --> 01:07:04,253
<i>If you want, you can just
give it to Sir Barry Torres.</i>

689
01:07:04,320 --> 01:07:06,689
<i>He is Mr. Torres' grandchild.</i>

690
01:07:06,756 --> 01:07:08,124
Ah, Mr. Barry Torres…

691
01:07:17,133 --> 01:07:19,935
