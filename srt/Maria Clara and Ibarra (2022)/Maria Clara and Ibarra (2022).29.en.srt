1
00:00:28,261 --> 00:00:31,431
MARIA CLARA AND IBARRA

2
00:00:31,498 --> 00:00:35,435
THIS PROGRAM, WHICH IS ADAPTED
FROM THE NOVELS OF DR. JOSE P. RIZAL,

3
00:00:35,502 --> 00:00:40,440
IS PRESENTED USING DRAMATIC ELEMENTS
TO CONNECT THE PRESENT AND THE PAST

4
00:00:40,507 --> 00:00:46,379
IN A SPECIAL REIMAGINING OF THE NATIONAL
LITERATURE FILIPINOS ARE PROUD OF.

5
00:00:46,446 --> 00:00:49,916
<i>I heard that Sir Ibarra
has been excommunicated.</i>

6
00:00:49,983 --> 00:00:53,253
What would happen now to poor Maria Clara?

7
00:00:53,319 --> 00:00:55,288
You were not using your head, mister.

8
00:00:55,355 --> 00:00:59,626
What if you kneel before the friar,
ask for his forgiveness,

9
00:00:59,692 --> 00:01:02,962
<i>and tell him that you will do
everything that they want?</i>

10
00:01:03,029 --> 00:01:05,398
The disrespect!
Tiburcio, don't just stand there!

11
00:01:05,465 --> 00:01:07,367
You have no respect! Insolent!

12
00:01:08,868 --> 00:01:11,938
<i>That seems to be an important letter,
Your Reverence.</i>

13
00:01:12,005 --> 00:01:18,812
This letter contains a huge scandal
that will ruin Father Damaso's honor.

14
00:01:18,878 --> 00:01:21,648
<i>Godfather, have mercy on us.</i>

15
00:01:21,714 --> 00:01:23,316
Crisostomo was only provoked.

16
00:01:23,383 --> 00:01:25,785
He was angry because of his father.

17
00:01:25,852 --> 00:01:28,354
What do I need to do for you
to forgive Crisostomo?

18
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:31,691
<i>You cannot change my mind.</i>

19
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:34,527
<i>I really want to help you
but I don't know how.</i>

20
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:35,829
<i>What do I need to do?</i>

21
00:01:35,895 --> 00:01:37,630
Can I ask a favor from you?

22
00:01:37,697 --> 00:01:39,365
Of course, señorita. Anything.

23
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:41,534
Don't let anything bad happen
to Crisostomo.

24
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:44,437
Good thing you didn't fight back.
And you controlled yourself.

25
00:01:44,504 --> 00:01:46,172
<i>If I only thought of controlling myself</i>

26
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:48,041
<i>when I was being insulted
by the former curate.</i>

27
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:50,543
Then I would have avoided
excommunication as punishment.

28
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:53,913
<i>Now, this will just drive me
and Maria further apart.</i>

29
00:01:55,014 --> 00:01:55,949
Maria!

30
00:01:56,015 --> 00:01:58,885
<i>Andeng! Please, come here!</i>

31
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:02,622
I think you better call the curate.

32
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:05,725
-Dear curate, Maria Clara is delirious!
<i>-Saint Mary.</i>

33
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:07,894
PREVIOUSLY…

34
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:08,962
<i>Thank God.</i>

35
00:02:09,028 --> 00:02:10,230
You're conscious now, my child!

36
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:15,468
Leave Maria Clara and I alone
so that she can confess.

37
00:02:15,535 --> 00:02:21,107
Do you have any sin
you wish to confess to me?

38
00:02:23,042 --> 00:02:26,980
Señor General, I came here
to ask for your help

39
00:02:27,046 --> 00:02:28,882
to meet the Governor General.

40
00:02:28,948 --> 00:02:30,583
I want to ask for his help

41
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:35,388
<i>so that I will not be completely forsaken
by the friars and the church.</i>

42
00:03:36,516 --> 00:03:37,917
You can show yourself now,

43
00:03:37,984 --> 00:03:39,252
Elias.

44
00:03:58,037 --> 00:03:59,105
Señor.

45
00:04:03,176 --> 00:04:05,211
You shouldn't have come here, mister.

46
00:04:06,846 --> 00:04:09,148
You are only putting yourself in danger.

47
00:04:09,215 --> 00:04:10,883
Especially now that--

48
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:12,151
You are excommunicated?

49
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,688
I'm aware of that, señor.

50
00:04:17,223 --> 00:04:20,960
I came here because
there's something you need to know.

51
00:04:23,896 --> 00:04:24,797
And that is?

52
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:29,502
Seeing how the friars treated you harshly,

53
00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:31,204
I am sure, señor,

54
00:04:31,838 --> 00:04:35,642
that they will not stop just because
you are excommunicated from the church.

55
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:40,013
They will continue
to find a way to kill you.

56
00:04:44,517 --> 00:04:48,855
And what do you suggest
I should do to prevent that?

57
00:04:49,722 --> 00:04:51,724
I came here to tell you, señor,

58
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:56,396
that you have allies ready to make a move

59
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:59,499
against them if you want you.

60
00:05:02,068 --> 00:05:04,370
They might not have
the same social status as you,

61
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:11,010
but they are children, wives,
husbands, siblings,

62
00:05:12,111 --> 00:05:14,814
fathers, and mothers,

63
00:05:15,915 --> 00:05:19,185
who have been oppressed just like you

64
00:05:19,252 --> 00:05:21,120
and are seeking justice.

65
00:05:25,358 --> 00:05:27,994
But I don't want any more trouble, mister.

66
00:05:29,095 --> 00:05:32,498
I still believe that there is
a proper way to deal with issues

67
00:05:32,565 --> 00:05:33,833
and achieve justice.

68
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:39,972
Do the Indios have the same privilege?

69
00:05:42,742 --> 00:05:44,711
Or are you the only one
who can benefit from this?

70
00:05:46,546 --> 00:05:49,949
For how long will you be able
to use that small privilege

71
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:51,951
that connects you to the colonizers?

72
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:56,656
But not all Spaniards are bad.

73
00:05:56,723 --> 00:05:57,890
Yes, there are some.

74
00:05:57,957 --> 00:06:02,161
But if the abusive power
of the friars is removed,

75
00:06:03,629 --> 00:06:04,997
then that will be the seed

76
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:10,336
of reform that can change this country.

77
00:06:11,404 --> 00:06:12,505
Reform?

78
00:06:14,674 --> 00:06:17,543
It seems that you have been
fooled by them, señor.

79
00:06:20,313 --> 00:06:21,781
It saddens me.

80
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:24,751
I hope you won't continue to fall

81
00:06:24,817 --> 00:06:30,523
for the lies and false hopes they peddle.

82
00:06:41,634 --> 00:06:43,302
Because it is only
a matter of time, señor.

83
00:06:44,437 --> 00:06:48,741
Your allies will soon
have enough strength and help.

84
00:06:48,808 --> 00:06:51,144
Those who have been oppressed

85
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:53,846
will finally have the power to fight back.

86
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:59,018
Until we meet again, señor.

87
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:56,095
Andeng, where's the chocolate?

88
00:10:04,036 --> 00:10:05,838
She fell asleep.

89
00:10:07,206 --> 00:10:08,874
Was she able to confess?

90
00:10:10,409 --> 00:10:11,644
Yes, señora.

91
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:18,551
But let's not wake and bother her
so that she can still rest.

92
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:21,887
A visitor of hers came.

93
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:23,823
He is also worried about her.

94
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:27,426
Who?

95
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,955
Maria, my love.

96
00:10:58,524 --> 00:10:59,925
I am here now.

97
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:04,930
I will not abandon you.

98
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:08,801
I will not leave you.

99
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:32,558
Leave us alone.

100
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:33,592
Please.

101
00:11:37,096 --> 00:11:38,130
Let's go.

102
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:42,301
-Your chocolate is ready.
-Very well.

103
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:52,171
The Captain General has arrived.

104
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:55,007
Good morning!

105
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:00,346
Good morning!

106
00:13:02,748 --> 00:13:04,917
Your Reverences.

107
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:09,388
Who among you is Father Damaso,

108
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:10,923
the one that I always hear about?

109
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:15,661
He is sick, Your Excellency.

110
00:13:15,728 --> 00:13:17,730
That is why he's not here.

111
00:13:18,397 --> 00:13:19,698
Your Reverence.

112
00:13:19,765 --> 00:13:24,069
Are you the new curate
who replaced the arrogant Damaso?

113
00:13:24,904 --> 00:13:25,738
Yes.

114
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:28,808
If all the servants of His Excellency

115
00:13:28,874 --> 00:13:30,743
were like Father Damaso,

116
00:13:31,844 --> 00:13:37,183
I would rather serve His Excellency!

117
00:13:40,085 --> 00:13:43,022
Oh, Your Reverence probably got tired.

118
00:13:43,088 --> 00:13:46,525
He was here last night
and he looked after my sick daughter.

119
00:13:46,592 --> 00:13:47,793
His goddaughter.

120
00:13:48,394 --> 00:13:49,528
Stop the music!

121
00:13:52,765 --> 00:13:57,469
Do not bother Captain Tiago's
sick daughter.

122
00:13:58,604 --> 00:13:59,638
Very well.

123
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:03,809
Did the presence of the friar

124
00:14:03,876 --> 00:14:06,812
make your only daughter feel better,
Captain Tiago?

125
00:14:07,546 --> 00:14:08,414
Yes.

126
00:14:09,715 --> 00:14:16,188
Just like taking care
of Captain Tiago's poor sick daughter.

127
00:14:16,255 --> 00:14:22,428
I hope that Your Reverences will also
do the same for their respective towns.

128
00:14:22,494 --> 00:14:28,234
What is the use of prayers
and benediction for the sick

129
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:30,302
and those who have ill feelings
in this town?

130
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:39,645
Your Excellency, the gentleman is here.

131
00:14:42,615 --> 00:14:44,116
Señor Ibarra!

132
00:14:45,351 --> 00:14:46,685
How are you?

133
00:14:49,521 --> 00:14:51,190
Come, let's talk over there, okay?

134
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,696
What is an excommunicated doing here?

135
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:02,468
This was permitted by your Excellency.

136
00:15:16,715 --> 00:15:18,450
I'll be honest with you, señor.

137
00:15:20,052 --> 00:15:23,889
I am just waiting for an order
so that I can go back to Europe.

138
00:15:24,556 --> 00:15:27,960
I pray that you can come with me.

139
00:15:28,027 --> 00:15:31,931
Sell all your belongings
and just live there.

140
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:38,370
In Europe, you can do everything
that you want.

141
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:42,808
And there, as your friend,
I can assure you of your safety.

142
00:15:48,847 --> 00:15:54,119
Forgive me, your Excellency,
but I cannot leave this town.

143
00:15:56,021 --> 00:16:00,192
I want to fulfill my father's desire
to help the people of San Diego.

144
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:06,231
This is where I want to live.

145
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:08,701
And die?

146
00:16:12,371 --> 00:16:14,473
I just want to ask for your help

147
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:18,944
to put a stop to the punishment
of excommunication they wish to give me

148
00:16:19,011 --> 00:16:21,213
in order to destroy my reputation.

149
00:16:22,181 --> 00:16:23,782
Do not worry.

150
00:16:24,783 --> 00:16:28,554
I will talk to the Archbishop
about your excommunication.

151
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:31,757
I trust that I will be able
to convince him

152
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:34,626
that the punishment given to you
was unreasonable.

153
00:16:36,628 --> 00:16:39,598
<i>I just wish you success
in all your aspirations,</i>

154
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:41,033
<i>Señor Crisostomo Ibarra.</i>

155
00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:01,186
Ms. Klay.

156
00:17:02,154 --> 00:17:04,857
Thank you again for the cheese.

157
00:17:04,923 --> 00:17:07,493
Gosh, I hope this is as delicious
as the one you gave last time.

158
00:17:08,227 --> 00:17:09,995
Am I being demanding?

159
00:17:10,062 --> 00:17:12,231
But don't worry.
I will surely give this to Sir Ibarra.

160
00:17:12,831 --> 00:17:14,166
I will just ask him for some.

161
00:17:16,101 --> 00:17:21,106
Why didn't you go with Crisostomo
to see the Captain General?

162
00:17:23,742 --> 00:17:26,912
He said that it is better
if he pursues his plan

163
00:17:26,979 --> 00:17:29,548
with the Captain General alone.

164
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:33,652
Well, that's good.

165
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:39,525
That way, you'll lessen tagging along
with Crisostomo wherever he goes.

166
00:17:42,594 --> 00:17:43,962
Why?

167
00:17:44,029 --> 00:17:45,631
You're doing the same, right?

168
00:17:45,697 --> 00:17:48,200
You're always tagging along
with your friend too.

169
00:17:49,034 --> 00:17:50,536
And I don't have any problem with that.

170
00:17:50,602 --> 00:17:53,839
Because we both want the same thing,

171
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:56,909
and that is to look after him
and help him, right?

172
00:17:57,543 --> 00:17:58,377
That's all.

173
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:02,614
I don't have any other reason.

174
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,952
I already cleared this with you, right?

175
00:18:08,554 --> 00:18:09,388
Yes.

176
00:18:10,322 --> 00:18:11,423
You cleared it with me.

177
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:15,160
But, Ms. Klay,

178
00:18:15,227 --> 00:18:18,030
aside from helping Crisostomo.

179
00:18:19,398 --> 00:18:24,336
What about the needs
of a single woman like you?

180
00:18:25,971 --> 00:18:27,272
What about your desires?

181
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:29,341
Or the love of your life?

182
00:18:32,478 --> 00:18:33,445
That's deep.

183
00:18:34,246 --> 00:18:35,714
What are you saying?

184
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:38,851
Did I ever ask you
what your role is in this story

185
00:18:38,917 --> 00:18:40,452
aside from helping Ibarra?

186
00:18:42,688 --> 00:18:43,522
Story?

187
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:46,024
Nothing.

188
00:18:47,826 --> 00:18:50,162
Thank you again for the cheese.

189
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:53,132
But your friend is not here.

190
00:18:53,198 --> 00:18:55,467
And he's the reason
why you came here, right?

191
00:18:55,534 --> 00:18:57,936
So… bye!

192
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:02,574
Is he really the reason

193
00:19:03,542 --> 00:19:04,943
why I keep coming here?

194
00:19:05,711 --> 00:19:07,779
Well, I don't know. Why else?

195
00:19:21,393 --> 00:19:24,463
Why did you become silent all of a sudden?

196
00:19:27,733 --> 00:19:28,567
All right.

197
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:31,003
Bye.

198
00:19:32,871 --> 00:19:35,140
Ms. Klay. Wait!

199
00:19:37,376 --> 00:19:38,977
We are still talking, aren't we?

200
00:19:40,078 --> 00:19:42,314
Well…

201
00:19:42,381 --> 00:19:47,252
I just remembered that I still have
some chores I need to finish.

202
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:49,988
Yes, and I am running out of time.
Bye for now.

203
00:19:50,055 --> 00:19:51,657
Wait, Ms. Klay.

204
00:19:51,723 --> 00:19:53,725
In that case,
I will not waste any more time.

205
00:19:56,161 --> 00:19:57,095
Ms. Klay.

206
00:19:57,996 --> 00:19:58,897
Are you blind?

207
00:20:00,132 --> 00:20:01,600
Can't you see?

208
00:20:02,968 --> 00:20:05,170
Or are you so dense
that you can't feel it?

209
00:20:08,974 --> 00:20:10,709
Feel what?

210
00:20:11,743 --> 00:20:13,645
Despite your fierceness.

211
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:16,582
That's enough, Father!

212
00:20:17,149 --> 00:20:18,483
Despite acting like a witch.

213
00:20:19,351 --> 00:20:21,353
And going around San Diego,

214
00:20:22,955 --> 00:20:26,491
which is often disrespectful
and without manners.

215
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:27,859
Bye.

216
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:31,196
Now, this confrontation is over.

217
00:20:34,499 --> 00:20:36,501
And unlike a lot
of refined women out there.

218
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:38,070
Do you have a point?

219
00:20:38,136 --> 00:20:40,839
Or are you just making a recap
of this town's judgment of me?

220
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:42,975
Don't be shy. Why don't you include

221
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:45,377
how I follow your friend around
like a mistress?

222
00:20:45,444 --> 00:20:46,645
That, too.

223
00:20:47,879 --> 00:20:50,449
And despite being a stranger,

224
00:20:50,515 --> 00:20:52,317
not even knowing who you really are

225
00:20:52,384 --> 00:20:53,452
or where you came from.

226
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:56,688
Ms. Klay,

227
00:20:57,456 --> 00:20:59,458
I accepted you completely.

228
00:21:01,493 --> 00:21:03,195
And whatever sets you apart.

229
00:21:05,464 --> 00:21:07,232
You accepted me?

230
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:10,402
Say what now?

231
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:23,048
Ms. Klay, you are special to me.

232
00:21:26,184 --> 00:21:27,853
I'm in love with you, Ms. Klay.

233
00:21:47,706 --> 00:21:49,007
Listen, everyone!

234
00:21:50,909 --> 00:21:54,146
The Governor General will help
Señor Crisostomo Ibarra

235
00:21:54,212 --> 00:21:57,916
to have his excommunication lifted.

236
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:03,855
Well, Tiago.

237
00:22:04,423 --> 00:22:07,159
It looks like the young gentleman
will be your son-in-law after all.

238
00:22:16,201 --> 00:22:21,707
Thank you for your help,
your honorable Excellency.

239
00:22:21,773 --> 00:22:23,942
You're leaving so soon?

240
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:27,312
Aren't you going to visit
your fiancée who is sick?

241
00:22:29,648 --> 00:22:31,817
Maria Clara is sick?

242
00:22:35,487 --> 00:22:36,521
Uncle.

243
00:22:37,489 --> 00:22:43,195
Can I visit and speak with Maria
even just for a moment?

244
00:22:57,442 --> 00:22:58,343
Thank you.

245
00:23:10,322 --> 00:23:11,323
My child.

246
00:23:12,457 --> 00:23:13,992
You have a visitor.

247
00:23:31,176 --> 00:23:32,511
Crisostomo?

248
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:52,230
Crisostomo…

249
00:24:00,238 --> 00:24:03,875
My God, Saint Mary,
Saint Barbara, Saint Anthony!

250
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:29,367
Crisostomo Ibarra.

251
00:24:33,572 --> 00:24:34,973
I will fight

252
00:24:36,241 --> 00:24:37,843
for our love, Maria.

253
00:24:40,545 --> 00:24:42,781
I will not allow us to be separated.

254
00:24:45,851 --> 00:24:49,020
Therein lies my promise.

255
00:24:52,958 --> 00:24:54,226
That you, Maria,

256
00:24:57,028 --> 00:24:59,197
are the woman I am going to marry.

257
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:08,967
I know that you have been
taken aback by my confession.

258
00:26:10,802 --> 00:26:12,904
My apologies, Ms. Klay.

259
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:19,144
But, believe me,

260
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:20,912
I never expected this to happen as well.

261
00:26:22,547 --> 00:26:24,149
I never expected to fall for you.

262
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:28,119
But that is the truth, Ms. Klay.

263
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:34,059
This is crazy!

264
00:26:34,125 --> 00:26:36,761
All I wanted was to help
the characters in this novel.

265
00:26:36,828 --> 00:26:37,762
But…

266
00:26:38,897 --> 00:26:42,567
Why am I getting my own love story?

267
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:47,038
Ms. Klay?

268
00:26:48,473 --> 00:26:51,843
You are talking to yourself again.

269
00:26:56,214 --> 00:26:58,016
Sir Fidel,

270
00:26:59,517 --> 00:27:00,752
we cannot be together.

271
00:27:03,521 --> 00:27:05,523
It's impossible for us to be together.

272
00:27:08,059 --> 00:27:08,927
If only you knew.

273
00:27:09,494 --> 00:27:11,129
We are worlds apart.

274
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:12,931
I know that.

275
00:27:14,165 --> 00:27:17,068
I am aware that I am like heaven,
and you are earth.

276
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:20,238
But, Ms. Klay,

277
00:27:21,172 --> 00:27:23,141
that's not important.

278
00:27:23,708 --> 00:27:26,978
What's important is that
I wish to marry you.

279
00:27:27,579 --> 00:27:28,613
Huh? Wait!

280
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:29,914
Marry me? Really?

281
00:27:32,617 --> 00:27:35,453
It was not long ago when we would be
at each other's throats.

282
00:27:38,256 --> 00:27:39,124
That's true.

283
00:27:40,592 --> 00:27:45,163
And I didn't have feelings for you then
because you were such an annoying woman.

284
00:27:48,533 --> 00:27:51,202
That's why I was so surprised
when I realized

285
00:27:51,269 --> 00:27:55,640
that you have already captured
my heart, Ms. Klay!

286
00:27:56,241 --> 00:27:57,976
Then why are you mad at me?

287
00:27:58,043 --> 00:27:59,778
And why shouldn't I be mad at you?

288
00:28:01,946 --> 00:28:05,150
It seems that you don't like me.

289
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:09,954
Don't you realize, Ms. Klay?

290
00:28:10,622 --> 00:28:13,058
That you are so fortunate that I love you.

291
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:15,794
Well!

292
00:28:16,461 --> 00:28:18,697
If I was pursuing another woman,

293
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:22,000
I'm sure she would gladly
marry me right away.

294
00:28:23,301 --> 00:28:25,336
Hey, Fidel!

295
00:28:25,403 --> 00:28:27,906
Don't compare me to other women!

296
00:28:27,972 --> 00:28:30,608
Did I ask for you to love me?

297
00:28:30,675 --> 00:28:32,677
You're making it seem like
I owe it to you.

298
00:28:32,744 --> 00:28:36,815
Hello? I will never be blinded
by your wealth and stature in life.

299
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:39,751
Because you are so arrogant!

300
00:28:39,818 --> 00:28:42,287
My God, man! You have such a big ego!

301
00:28:42,353 --> 00:28:43,488
It's as tall as you!

302
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:46,458
Now, if you prefer a woman
who is easy to get

303
00:28:46,524 --> 00:28:49,728
and willing to marry you immediately,
then go for it!

304
00:28:50,662 --> 00:28:51,730
You are so conceited.

305
00:28:52,664 --> 00:28:55,934
It would be easy to look
for another woman.

306
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,836
Because you…

307
00:28:57,902 --> 00:28:59,637
You are one big disaster.

308
00:29:06,377 --> 00:29:10,548
Qualities that will only
bring trouble and shame to my life.

309
00:29:10,615 --> 00:29:12,717
Or even death.

310
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:15,253
What did you say?

311
00:29:47,852 --> 00:29:48,686
But…

312
00:29:49,954 --> 00:29:51,890
those qualities

313
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:57,195
are also what I love about you.

314
00:30:27,525 --> 00:30:28,526
It's true.

315
00:30:29,894 --> 00:30:33,598
It would be easy to find a woman
who's willing to marry me right away.

316
00:30:36,234 --> 00:30:42,841
But they will never be as clever
and as brave as you.

317
00:30:58,356 --> 00:30:59,624
Ms. Klay.

318
00:31:03,261 --> 00:31:05,230
I will not give up

319
00:31:05,296 --> 00:31:09,834
until I have proven
that I am worthy of your love.

320
00:31:18,409 --> 00:31:20,879
Until next time, Ms. Klay.

321
00:31:23,314 --> 00:31:24,148
Bye.

322
00:31:40,865 --> 00:31:42,033
What just happened?

323
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:51,142
So, that was the cheese.

324
00:32:03,821 --> 00:32:07,058
You will not like what I'm
about to tell you, Father.

325
00:32:09,994 --> 00:32:13,932
Crisostomo Ibarra
is at Captain Tiago's house

326
00:32:13,998 --> 00:32:17,335
and he's a guest of the Captain General.

327
00:32:19,337 --> 00:32:21,439
I am not surprised.

328
00:32:21,506 --> 00:32:26,311
I know that Ibarra is good friends
with the Captain General.

329
00:32:26,377 --> 00:32:31,015
That is why I'm not surprised
that those two devils are together.

330
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:33,818
We also shouldn't be surprised

331
00:32:33,885 --> 00:32:38,489
if the Captain General
will help Crisostomo Ibarra

332
00:32:38,556 --> 00:32:41,192
to get his excommunication lifted.

333
00:32:43,895 --> 00:32:46,464
Did the two demons see each other?

334
00:32:47,832 --> 00:32:48,766
Forgive me, Father.

335
00:32:48,833 --> 00:32:49,701
Yes?

336
00:32:49,767 --> 00:32:51,903
There are people who want to talk to you.

337
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:58,042
Good afternoon, Your Reverences.

338
00:32:58,109 --> 00:32:59,410
Good afternoon.

339
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:01,145
Father Damaso.

340
00:33:01,212 --> 00:33:03,681
-Father Salvi.
-Good afternoon.

341
00:33:05,216 --> 00:33:06,150
Good afternoon.

342
00:33:06,217 --> 00:33:09,520
Forgive me, Doña Victorina,

343
00:33:09,587 --> 00:33:15,326
but it would be better
if you would just come back

344
00:33:15,393 --> 00:33:18,196
so that we could talk
after we finish eating lunch.

345
00:33:19,063 --> 00:33:20,932
Forgive me, Your Reverences,

346
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:26,004
but my husband and I
came here to give a solution

347
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:30,041
to your problem regarding Maria Clara.

348
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:34,278
We know, Father,

349
00:33:34,879 --> 00:33:40,451
that you do not want Maria
and Ibarra to get married.

350
00:33:44,889 --> 00:33:48,926
He's a devil that will just bring

351
00:33:49,627 --> 00:33:52,196
my goddaughter to hell.

352
00:33:52,263 --> 00:33:54,632
That is true, Father.

353
00:33:54,699 --> 00:34:00,438
That is why we want to introduce you
to a young <i>peninsulares…</i>

354
00:34:00,505 --> 00:34:03,741
A more deserving man for Maria Clara.

355
00:34:04,809 --> 00:34:06,044
Peninsular?

356
00:34:07,478 --> 00:34:09,480
Yes, Father. Peninsular.

357
00:34:10,248 --> 00:34:14,919
He doesn't have the blood of an Indio.

358
00:34:14,986 --> 00:34:21,626
Like me, he was also born in Spain.

359
00:34:21,692 --> 00:34:24,962
That's why it would be an honor
for Maria Clara

360
00:34:25,029 --> 00:34:28,066
to marry one of our relatives.

361
00:34:31,002 --> 00:34:36,107
Who is this gentleman
you are talking about?

362
00:34:38,543 --> 00:34:41,379
Alfonso, come in.

363
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:54,692
Father Damaso,

364
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:55,927
Father Salvi,

365
00:34:55,993 --> 00:34:59,730
I would like you to meet our nephew,

366
00:35:00,865 --> 00:35:04,068
Señor Alfonso Linares.

367
00:35:05,336 --> 00:35:08,639
Thank you very much, Uncle,
for letting me visit Maria Clara.

368
00:35:09,407 --> 00:35:11,409
There is nothing I can do
if the Captain General

369
00:35:11,476 --> 00:35:12,643
has already made his decision.

370
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:16,481
But once the friars learn about this,

371
00:35:16,547 --> 00:35:18,416
I will also be reprimanded.

372
00:35:21,319 --> 00:35:23,888
Forgive me, Uncle,
for dragging you into this problem.

373
00:35:25,423 --> 00:35:28,593
But once the excommunication
punishment is lifted,

374
00:35:29,494 --> 00:35:33,231
even the friars won't be able to stop me
and Maria from being together.

375
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:35,233
Don't be too sure, Crisostomo,

376
00:35:36,334 --> 00:35:40,171
especially because the friars
are like gods here on earth.

377
00:35:41,739 --> 00:35:45,810
I have been telling you to try
and get along with them.

378
00:35:46,544 --> 00:35:48,012
But did you listen?

379
00:35:51,849 --> 00:35:55,620
Isn't following your advice a part
of getting along with them?

380
00:35:55,686 --> 00:35:59,157
To not make them pay for the cruelty
and disrespect they did to my father?

381
00:36:00,858 --> 00:36:06,898
How else do you want me
to get along with them?

382
00:36:09,233 --> 00:36:12,336
I seem to sense rage in your words.

383
00:36:14,505 --> 00:36:17,675
If you really want
to be married to my daughter,

384
00:36:19,043 --> 00:36:23,181
do not destroy your future
by rebelling against the friars.

385
00:36:23,247 --> 00:36:25,449
by going against the friars.

386
00:36:27,752 --> 00:36:29,520
You may go now, Crisostomo.

387
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:31,322
Goodbye.

388
00:36:50,741 --> 00:36:52,276
Good afternoon, Father.

389
00:36:52,343 --> 00:36:53,678
-Good afternoon.
-Good afternoon.

390
00:36:54,245 --> 00:36:55,346
Your Reverence.

391
00:36:58,849 --> 00:37:03,321
Did you just arrive here from Spain?

392
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:06,457
Yes, Father. From Madrid.

393
00:37:06,524 --> 00:37:10,561
But this is not my first time
here in the Philippines.

394
00:37:12,096 --> 00:37:15,967
And you speak the native language well.

395
00:37:16,033 --> 00:37:17,568
Yes, Father.

396
00:37:17,635 --> 00:37:22,673
Alfonso lived with us in Manila
since he was a kid.

397
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:27,545
He just went back home to Spain
to finish his law degree.

398
00:37:27,612 --> 00:37:32,683
And he was able to finish
his course at the university

399
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:37,088
with the highest honor.

400
00:37:37,154 --> 00:37:40,625
Do not praise me too much, please.
It's embarrassing.

401
00:37:40,691 --> 00:37:43,894
Do not be embarrassed
by the praises, Alfonso.

402
00:37:45,463 --> 00:37:46,464
Very well,

403
00:37:47,531 --> 00:37:50,301
I also want you to meet my goddaughter.

404
00:37:51,402 --> 00:37:57,675
You know what? You are both educated
and from an upper-class family.

405
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:01,545
And once you see Maria,

406
00:38:04,215 --> 00:38:08,953
she is like an angel when it comes
to her appearance and voice.

407
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:11,789
Oh, that's true.

408
00:38:11,856 --> 00:38:13,891
That's why you two are a perfect match.

409
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:14,792
But…

410
00:38:15,826 --> 00:38:19,330
the young man still has to prove himself

411
00:38:19,397 --> 00:38:22,933
before you let him meet Maria Clara.

412
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:29,040
This young man still has plenty of time
to prove himself, beloved curate.

413
00:38:30,541 --> 00:38:32,109
Doña Victorina.

414
00:38:32,176 --> 00:38:33,744
-Yes, Father?
-Be ready.

415
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:36,714
Because in a few days,

416
00:38:36,781 --> 00:38:40,484
I will accompany you to meet Maria Clara.

417
00:38:40,551 --> 00:38:44,121
Oh, that's a good decision, Father.

418
00:38:44,188 --> 00:38:45,523
Thank you very much.

419
00:38:45,589 --> 00:38:46,424
You are welcome.

420
00:38:47,591 --> 00:38:51,128
-Goodbye, Father.
-A very good decision, Father.

421
00:38:54,699 --> 00:38:55,900
Goodbye.

422
00:38:55,966 --> 00:38:58,102
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

423
00:39:25,096 --> 00:39:26,997
May God have mercy on your soul,

424
00:39:27,064 --> 00:39:29,633
but you are no longer allowed to enter

425
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:32,803
the holy Catholic church
to receive God's grace.

426
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:36,507
You are now excommunicated.

427
00:39:58,629 --> 00:40:00,197
<i>Even if everyone knows</i>

428
00:40:00,264 --> 00:40:03,434
<i>that I am still not allowed
to go inside the house of God.</i>

429
00:40:03,501 --> 00:40:05,102
<i>But it is now</i>

430
00:40:05,169 --> 00:40:09,340
<i>that I need Your presence all the more.</i>

431
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:15,379
<i>Because I am slowly running out
of reasons to hold on</i>

432
00:40:15,446 --> 00:40:17,581
<i>to your promise of salvation.</i>

433
00:40:18,482 --> 00:40:20,251
<i>I still want to believe</i>

434
00:40:20,851 --> 00:40:24,321
<i>that you are not just a product
of the friars' imagination</i>

435
00:40:24,388 --> 00:40:27,758
<i>that is used to conquer our minds
and our homeland.</i>

436
00:40:28,559 --> 00:40:30,161
<i>That you are real.</i>

437
00:40:30,227 --> 00:40:33,030
<i>And that they are not using you
to make us blindly obey them,</i>

438
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:34,398
<i>fear them,</i>

439
00:40:34,465 --> 00:40:38,502
<i>and accept that we are inferior
and worthless.</i>

440
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:44,642
<i>And that your messengers
are not using Your name</i>

441
00:40:44,708 --> 00:40:48,512
<i>to play with our fate and lives.</i>

442
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:54,452
<i>I do not blame anyone
for the injustice my father suffered.</i>

443
00:40:55,052 --> 00:40:59,857
<i>I believe there is a God
who serves justice.</i>

444
00:41:01,091 --> 00:41:03,527
<i>But when will that happen?</i>

445
00:41:05,563 --> 00:41:08,365
<i>Will I still be able to witness justice?</i>

446
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:14,605
<i>Or will I also be imprisoned
and die early?</i>

447
00:41:15,339 --> 00:41:19,543
<i>And just leave behind
my poor Maria suffering?</i>

448
00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:20,878
Crisostomo?

449
00:41:22,112 --> 00:41:27,017
<i>I know that you are a God
of justice and equality.</i>

450
00:41:27,084 --> 00:41:30,654
<i>That's why I'm certain
that the day will come</i>

451
00:41:30,721 --> 00:41:33,824
<i>when Your judgment will prevail.</i>

452
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:35,326
<i>Amen.</i>

453
00:41:55,779 --> 00:41:57,882
Not that I am interfering, Father.

454
00:41:57,948 --> 00:42:00,818
Please forgive what I am about to say.

455
00:42:02,653 --> 00:42:04,455
But I don't think it's right

456
00:42:06,824 --> 00:42:11,061
to promise Maria to a man
you do not know full well.

457
00:42:13,764 --> 00:42:16,967
Do you think I will put Maria at risk?

458
00:42:17,935 --> 00:42:19,069
I know you won't.

459
00:42:21,605 --> 00:42:23,307
She is like…

460
00:42:25,276 --> 00:42:26,844
a daughter to you.

461
00:42:26,911 --> 00:42:29,346
That's right.

462
00:42:29,413 --> 00:42:32,883
She is like a daughter to me.

463
00:42:34,251 --> 00:42:35,686
In that case,

464
00:42:35,753 --> 00:42:40,257
isn't it right to get to know Mr. Linares

465
00:42:40,324 --> 00:42:42,760
before you promise Maria Clara to him?

466
00:42:43,494 --> 00:42:47,064
I trust the couple to whom he is related.

467
00:42:48,432 --> 00:42:49,633
Also,

468
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:54,838
I would rather have Maria Clara
end up with anyone

469
00:42:54,905 --> 00:42:57,608
as long as he is pure Spanish,

470
00:42:57,675 --> 00:43:00,010
and not with Crisostomo Ibarra.

471
00:43:04,648 --> 00:43:06,083
Let's eat.

472
00:43:20,698 --> 00:43:21,832
Señor Fidel!

473
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,635
Good afternoon!

474
00:43:25,903 --> 00:43:29,707
What's good about the afternoon, señorita?

475
00:43:32,209 --> 00:43:34,345
It seems that the gentleman
is out of his wits.

476
00:43:34,411 --> 00:43:38,983
I just couldn't believe
that a woman would refuse me.

477
00:43:39,583 --> 00:43:40,851
Who does she think she is?

478
00:43:41,418 --> 00:43:42,920
She's nothing but a pain in the neck.

479
00:43:43,954 --> 00:43:48,025
It seems that you're talking about
a specific person, señor.

480
00:43:49,126 --> 00:43:52,696
Perhaps it's a woman…

481
00:43:53,731 --> 00:43:56,433
whom you have fallen for.

482
00:43:57,067 --> 00:43:59,336
She is a witch, who now owns…

483
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:04,408
not only my mind but also my…

484
00:44:05,376 --> 00:44:06,210
heart.

485
00:44:08,312 --> 00:44:10,047
My goodness!

486
00:44:10,114 --> 00:44:11,315
She's just…

487
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:14,385
I feel like I am cursed.

488
00:44:24,028 --> 00:44:24,962
Señor.

489
00:44:26,030 --> 00:44:31,135
Love is not a curse
if it's a requited love.

490
00:44:31,702 --> 00:44:33,003
But if not,

491
00:44:34,204 --> 00:44:36,040
it can crush one's heart.

492
00:44:36,807 --> 00:44:42,646
Especially if the one you have fallen for
is in love with somebody else.

493
00:44:45,015 --> 00:44:46,483
Isn't that right?

494
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:05,102
My friend.

495
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:09,073
Are you saying something, señor?

496
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:11,141
Nothing.

497
00:45:11,909 --> 00:45:13,777
Nothing, señorita.

498
00:45:14,745 --> 00:45:15,746
All right.

499
00:45:16,613 --> 00:45:18,282
Goodbye. Until we meet again.

500
00:45:19,717 --> 00:45:21,251
Goodbye, señor.

501
00:45:30,561 --> 00:45:32,629
I think the friars liked me.

502
00:45:32,696 --> 00:45:33,697
Right?

503
00:45:34,832 --> 00:45:37,067
That's right, Alfonso.

504
00:45:37,134 --> 00:45:41,972
That's why you should do better
when you meet Maria Clara.

505
00:45:42,039 --> 00:45:46,176
You must make her fall for you.

506
00:45:50,748 --> 00:45:52,716
Is it true that Maria Clara
is very beautiful?

507
00:45:52,783 --> 00:45:59,089
Yes, she's indeed very beautiful.

508
00:46:00,357 --> 00:46:03,293
She is not only beautiful, Alfonso.

509
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:06,897
Captain Tiago has many properties.

510
00:46:06,964 --> 00:46:08,165
And that's not all!

511
00:46:08,232 --> 00:46:12,169
He has many businesses in Manila.

512
00:46:14,104 --> 00:46:18,208
Maria Clara is Tiago's only child…

513
00:46:19,109 --> 00:46:20,277
and heiress.

514
00:46:20,344 --> 00:46:25,082
And who do you think will benefit
from all of that?

515
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:30,420
Doña Maria Clara, for sure.

516
00:46:30,487 --> 00:46:35,526
And her soon-to-be husband.

517
00:46:36,527 --> 00:46:37,561
And that must be you!

518
00:46:39,363 --> 00:46:43,500
Nobody else but you.

519
00:47:04,888 --> 00:47:07,124
<i>Apologies, mister.</i>

520
00:47:07,191 --> 00:47:11,662
Let the woman be and don't get
carried away by your emotions.

521
00:47:15,632 --> 00:47:17,100
For your tears.

522
00:47:17,167 --> 00:47:19,236
But don't wipe
your snot with it, all right?

523
00:47:19,903 --> 00:47:23,607
Didn't you like my small gift for you?

524
00:47:23,674 --> 00:47:25,242
For me?

525
00:47:31,915 --> 00:47:33,917
I'm in love with you, Ms. Klay.

526
00:47:37,054 --> 00:47:38,455
I didn't notice…

527
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:43,093
that my beauty has captured old Fidel.

528
00:47:47,764 --> 00:47:49,266
This can't be, Klay.

529
00:47:53,036 --> 00:47:55,772
You can't insert your own love story
into this story.

530
00:47:55,839 --> 00:47:57,674
It's already chaotic here.

531
00:47:57,741 --> 00:48:01,812
The main characters of this story
are none other than Maria Clara and…

532
00:48:02,346 --> 00:48:03,180
Sir Ibarra!

533
00:48:06,316 --> 00:48:08,852
How did your conversation
with the Captain General go?

534
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:11,955
The outcome was very good.

535
00:48:12,956 --> 00:48:14,358
The thing is,

536
00:48:14,424 --> 00:48:17,628
Maria's father is against me until now.

537
00:48:19,196 --> 00:48:21,531
Let's go inside
and I will tell you about it.

538
00:48:23,967 --> 00:48:26,336
Señor, you have a visitor.

539
00:48:35,212 --> 00:48:37,981
Señor Crisostomo, good evening.

540
00:48:39,616 --> 00:48:43,687
I am Lucas, the brother of the man
killed by the derrick at your school.

541
00:49:24,995 --> 00:49:28,131
Good morning, señor!
This is a letter for you.

542
00:49:28,198 --> 00:49:30,667
It has the signature
of His Highness, the Archbishop.

543
00:49:30,734 --> 00:49:32,135
From the Archbishop?

544
00:49:32,202 --> 00:49:36,506
What if he will make good
on his promise to Señor Ibarra

545
00:49:36,573 --> 00:49:38,542
<i>to lift his excommunication?</i>

546
00:49:38,608 --> 00:49:41,845
I'm sure that you and Father Damaso
will be put to shame

547
00:49:41,912 --> 00:49:42,913
in front of the people.

548
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:45,015
I want you to do something.

549
00:49:45,082 --> 00:49:47,184
<i>Do you really love Maria?</i>

550
00:49:47,250 --> 00:49:48,485
<i>Or perhaps…</i>

551
00:49:48,552 --> 00:49:50,587
you love another woman?

552
00:49:50,654 --> 00:49:53,256
Like Ms. Klay, for example.

553
00:49:53,323 --> 00:49:56,226
<i>I want Alfonso to be your husband</i>

554
00:49:56,293 --> 00:50:00,297
instead of Crisostomo Ibarra.

555
00:50:00,364 --> 00:50:01,965
COMING UP…

556
00:50:07,804 --> 00:50:10,140
