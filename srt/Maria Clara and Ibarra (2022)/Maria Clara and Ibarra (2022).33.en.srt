00:00:27,961 --> 00:00:31,398
MARIA CLARA AND IBARRA

2
00:00:31,464 --> 00:00:35,568
THIS PROGRAM, WHICH IS ADAPTED
FROM THE NOVELS OF DR. JOSE P. RIZAL,

3
00:00:35,635 --> 00:00:40,573
IS PRESENTED USING DRAMATIC ELEMENTS
TO CONNECT THE PRESENT AND THE PAST

4
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:45,745
IN A SPECIAL REIMAGINING OF THE NATIONAL
LITERATURE FILIPINOS ARE PROUD OF.

5
00:00:46,446 --> 00:00:48,615
I believe, now more than ever,

6
00:00:48,681 --> 00:00:51,951
that the only way for every family
in our country to receive justice

7
00:00:52,018 --> 00:00:54,587
is by not allowing ourselves
to be conquered by Spaniards!

8
00:00:54,654 --> 00:00:57,791
But rebellion isn't the answer
to the change that you've wanted!

9
00:00:57,857 --> 00:00:59,392
<i>Without rebellion…</i>

10
00:00:59,459 --> 00:01:00,760
<i>no one will be freed.</i>

11
00:01:00,827 --> 00:01:03,997
<i>No light will be shed in this country.</i>

12
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:07,934
I will never join that kind of movement.

13
00:01:08,001 --> 00:01:09,736
You're earning more enemies!

14
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:12,472
And I assure you, they will not stop.

15
00:01:13,039 --> 00:01:14,941
They will destroy and kill you!

16
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:16,576
<i>Like what they did to my kin…</i>

17
00:01:16,643 --> 00:01:17,944
<i>and to your father.</i>

18
00:01:18,011 --> 00:01:20,146
You will just end up like them.

19
00:01:20,213 --> 00:01:24,184
<i>Aren't you wondering why she was
weeping when she arrived?</i>

20
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,786
It seems like she's acting strange, right?

21
00:01:26,853 --> 00:01:27,754
<i>You're right.</i>

22
00:01:27,821 --> 00:01:29,856
<i>But for now, the important thing</i>

23
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:33,593
is for us to talk about
the supplication tomorrow.

24
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:36,062
Don't worry, I will talk to her.

25
00:01:36,129 --> 00:01:38,765
There's something you should
know about Maria Clara.

26
00:01:38,832 --> 00:01:41,167
I saw her earlier.
She was crying profusely.

27
00:01:41,234 --> 00:01:42,569
Did she say why?

28
00:01:42,635 --> 00:01:44,537
First thing tomorrow, I will go to her

29
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:46,673
and I will do everything
for her to confess.

30
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:49,042
<i>Where are my letters?</i>

31
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:52,278
And who told you that
you can reveal those letters?

32
00:01:52,345 --> 00:01:55,482
What with those and you're so furious?

33
00:01:55,548 --> 00:01:58,218
If I found out that even I,

34
00:01:58,284 --> 00:02:01,254
who's putting up with you
and trying to be your friend,

35
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:03,223
have been stabbed by you in the back…

36
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:07,026
Then consider me your worst enemy!

37
00:02:07,093 --> 00:02:08,695
<i>And that's all you need to know.</i>

38
00:02:08,761 --> 00:02:10,130
<i>My God…</i>

39
00:02:10,196 --> 00:02:12,732
<i>please guide me with my decisions.</i>

40
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:15,001
<i>Should I surrender these letters</i>

41
00:02:15,068 --> 00:02:16,970
<i>in exchange for my mother's?</i>

42
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:23,977
<i>And why are you here?</i>

43
00:02:24,043 --> 00:02:25,645
I have some news.

44
00:02:26,212 --> 00:02:28,248
Their wedding will push through.

45
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:30,216
What? This is a curse from God!

46
00:02:30,283 --> 00:02:32,719
PREVIOUSLY

47
00:02:39,259 --> 00:02:41,194
When will you stop pestering me?

48
00:02:42,061 --> 00:02:45,798
Ms. Klay, I came here to apologize.

49
00:02:46,366 --> 00:02:47,834
If you're sick of me…

50
00:02:53,273 --> 00:02:54,274
it's okay.

51
00:02:55,608 --> 00:02:57,544
Honestly, I'm used to it.

52
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:58,912
I am infuriated now.

53
00:02:58,978 --> 00:03:01,314
This novel is about to end
and yet you're still annoying.

54
00:03:01,881 --> 00:03:02,815
Wait…

55
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:05,385
A novel?

56
00:03:06,286 --> 00:03:08,288
I haven't told you yet, right?

57
00:03:11,658 --> 00:03:13,626
How many times do I have to say

58
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:15,428
that all of you are just
a book's characters?

59
00:03:15,495 --> 00:03:17,564
And I was just sent to be here.

60
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:19,966
So it's impossible for me
to have a boyfriend here.

61
00:03:20,633 --> 00:03:22,001
I won't explain it anymore.

62
00:03:22,068 --> 00:03:23,736
I'm just wasting my time.

63
00:03:23,803 --> 00:03:26,372
I'll go ahead. I have an
important thing to attend to.

64
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:27,540
Bye!

65
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:38,785
That's all you've done?

66
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:43,056
Can you please hurry up? You're too slow.

67
00:03:48,328 --> 00:03:49,162
Aunt…

68
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:51,664
I'm sorry.

69
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:54,934
Everything happened so fast.

70
00:03:55,935 --> 00:03:57,804
It seems like I'm only
giving you a headache.

71
00:03:58,938 --> 00:04:00,873
You did nothing wrong, Maria.

72
00:04:01,374 --> 00:04:03,977
I just want you to look your best
in front of your fiancé later.

73
00:04:06,145 --> 00:04:08,014
I will talk to Crisostomo.

74
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:12,285
There are some things
that I need to confess to him.

75
00:04:13,286 --> 00:04:14,587
Confess what?

76
00:04:16,456 --> 00:04:19,959
You can't tell Tiago about this.

77
00:04:20,026 --> 00:04:21,427
It will break his heart.

78
00:04:21,494 --> 00:04:23,796
This will destroy him.

79
00:04:25,732 --> 00:04:27,133
My apologies, Aunt.

80
00:04:27,734 --> 00:04:28,801
But…

81
00:04:28,868 --> 00:04:31,271
There are things that should
only be between me and Crisostomo.

82
00:04:33,473 --> 00:04:34,641
All right.

83
00:04:34,707 --> 00:04:38,144
Well then, maybe you should take a bath

84
00:04:38,211 --> 00:04:40,513
and I'll ask Andeng
to prepare your clothes.

85
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:41,681
Andeng!

86
00:04:41,748 --> 00:04:44,384
Doña Isabel, Andeng left a while ago.

87
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:46,152
I don't know where she went.

88
00:04:46,219 --> 00:04:47,553
What?

89
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:48,755
Of all the time, why now?

90
00:04:48,821 --> 00:04:50,690
We have so many things to do!

91
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:52,492
My goodness!

92
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:55,528
All right, all right!
What are you doing here?

93
00:04:55,595 --> 00:04:57,063
Move quickly!

94
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,731
My goodness, these people!

95
00:05:02,101 --> 00:05:03,002
Indio!

96
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:07,507
Summon Father Damaso

97
00:05:07,573 --> 00:05:09,208
I wish to talk to him.

98
00:05:09,275 --> 00:05:10,576
Immediately.

99
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:12,278
But the friar doesn't want
to be disturbed.

100
00:05:12,345 --> 00:05:14,314
I was told earlier today.

101
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:16,349
He might get angry at me if I call him.

102
00:05:19,252 --> 00:05:23,089
Well then, I will talk to Maria myself.

103
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:24,123
Right now!

104
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:26,359
Move!

105
00:05:30,963 --> 00:05:32,532
I'll be the one to go to the Chinese man

106
00:05:32,598 --> 00:05:34,267
to get all the materials.

107
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:38,171
Yes, we already have an agreement.

108
00:05:38,237 --> 00:05:39,539
Goodbye, señor.

109
00:05:39,605 --> 00:05:40,473
Goodbye.

110
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:47,814
I didn't expect you here, my friend.

111
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:56,089
My friend, there is something
I want to know about Ms. Klay.

112
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:00,259
It seems that you have fallen

113
00:06:00,326 --> 00:06:02,829
for a stranger who wandered
into our lives, my friend.

114
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:12,305
I'm aware that you've noticed that
she keeps saying strange things

115
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:14,140
that we cannot understand.

116
00:06:15,241 --> 00:06:16,576
But this thing that she said,

117
00:06:16,642 --> 00:06:20,246
about us just being characters in a novel?

118
00:06:20,813 --> 00:06:22,382
She mentioned that to me before.

119
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:25,218
And what did she tell you?

120
00:06:29,021 --> 00:06:32,191
I'm from the year 2022.

121
00:06:32,258 --> 00:06:34,160
And because of some…

122
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:37,196
I don't know, my professor is probably
a sorcerer.

123
00:06:37,263 --> 00:06:39,365
And he brought me here in this world.

124
00:06:39,432 --> 00:06:41,167
To the world of <i>Noli Me Tangere.</i>

125
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:44,370
A novel that was written
by our national hero.

126
00:06:44,437 --> 00:06:50,009
And both you and Maria Clara
are just characters from that novel.

127
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:51,811
Since I'm already here,

128
00:06:51,878 --> 00:06:54,814
I probably became a character too.
That's the true story.

129
00:06:54,881 --> 00:06:55,848
I promise.

130
00:06:56,549 --> 00:06:59,619
That's why I really don't know
if Ms. Klay is just fooling around

131
00:06:59,685 --> 00:07:02,221
or if she's actually losing her mind.

132
00:07:02,288 --> 00:07:06,025
That's why I just accepted
the lady for who she is.

133
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,561
She spews a lot of nonsense.

134
00:07:09,662 --> 00:07:12,698
So, as much as possible just ignore
some things

135
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:14,634
that come out of her mouth.

136
00:07:15,868 --> 00:07:17,336
Well then, let's go.

137
00:07:17,837 --> 00:07:20,006
I need to get ready
for my formal wedding proposal.

138
00:07:38,257 --> 00:07:39,659
Señorita…

139
00:07:41,093 --> 00:07:43,329
-Dear curate…
-What's the problem…

140
00:07:43,396 --> 00:07:46,332
I wasn't expecting you today.

141
00:07:52,705 --> 00:07:55,908
Aren't you going to let me in,
Aunt Isabel?

142
00:07:57,677 --> 00:07:59,779
Forgive me, come inside.

143
00:07:59,846 --> 00:08:01,380
Let's go.

144
00:08:01,447 --> 00:08:03,616
Oh no, I am having a bit of bad luck.

145
00:08:04,116 --> 00:08:06,152
How will I talk to Maria Clara now?

146
00:08:20,066 --> 00:08:22,401
Aunt, please tell the curate
that I am sick.

147
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:25,638
And that I'm not yet ready to talk to him.

148
00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:28,174
What's happening to you?

149
00:08:28,941 --> 00:08:30,309
You seem terrified!

150
00:08:38,484 --> 00:08:39,819
She's right, Maria.

151
00:08:42,288 --> 00:08:45,725
Why are you afraid of your confessor?

152
00:08:51,264 --> 00:08:55,301
Aunt Isabel, give me and Maria
a moment alone.

153
00:08:55,801 --> 00:08:56,836
Please.

154
00:09:03,142 --> 00:09:06,879
-Dance for us, Sisa!
-Dance for us, Sisa!

155
00:09:07,446 --> 00:09:11,083
-Dance for us, Sisa!
-Dance for us, Sisa!

156
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:17,390
-Dance, Sisa.
-Dance, Sisa.

157
00:09:17,456 --> 00:09:20,159
Hey!

158
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:21,727
What the hell? Leave her alone!

159
00:09:21,794 --> 00:09:23,796
You better get lost
before I hit all of you!

160
00:09:23,863 --> 00:09:25,031
Let's go!

161
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:30,670
Ms. Sisa…

162
00:09:31,871 --> 00:09:33,472
Ms. Sisa, it's me, Fidel.

163
00:09:36,676 --> 00:09:38,044
Ms. Sisa, why are you here?

164
00:09:39,178 --> 00:09:40,980
Did you escape from the hospice?

165
00:09:49,855 --> 00:09:52,258
Did…

166
00:09:52,325 --> 00:09:54,527
Did you see them?

167
00:09:56,329 --> 00:09:58,798
Did you see my sons?

168
00:10:03,502 --> 00:10:06,839
My children were taken away from me.

169
00:10:09,675 --> 00:10:12,912
The devils took them away from me.

170
00:10:12,979 --> 00:10:15,081
Those devils.

171
00:10:16,349 --> 00:10:19,285
Help me…

172
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:23,823
Help me take them back from those devils.

173
00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:25,391
Help…

174
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,493
Help me!

175
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,561
Ms. Sisa…

176
00:10:30,396 --> 00:10:33,466
Help me take them back from those demons!

177
00:10:33,532 --> 00:10:39,972
Help me…

178
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:41,173
Ms. Sisa…

179
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,842
Help me…

180
00:10:42,908 --> 00:10:45,211
Ms. Sisa, please stand up.

181
00:10:45,277 --> 00:10:46,312
Ms. Sisa…

182
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:53,419
Ms. Sisa, why did you escape?

183
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:56,055
You shouldn't have escaped
from the hospice.

184
00:10:56,122 --> 00:10:58,257
Come on, let me take you there.

185
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:02,161
I will take you back there.

186
00:11:02,228 --> 00:11:03,496
Ms. Sisa, come on.

187
00:11:04,563 --> 00:11:05,898
-I don't like it there!
-Ms. Sisa.

188
00:11:05,965 --> 00:11:07,366
-I don't want to go!
-Stand up!

189
00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:10,403
-I don't want to go!
-Ms. Sisa.

190
00:11:10,469 --> 00:11:14,240
Enough!

191
00:11:14,306 --> 00:11:15,508
Ms. Sisa, let's go!

192
00:11:15,574 --> 00:11:16,709
I've had enough!

193
00:11:29,288 --> 00:11:30,756
Thank you very much, Aunt.

194
00:11:30,823 --> 00:11:32,058
Thank you very much.

195
00:11:34,894 --> 00:11:36,362
Forgive me, Father.

196
00:11:36,962 --> 00:11:39,131
I'm not ready to talk to you yet.

197
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:40,933
I'm still undecided.

198
00:11:42,001 --> 00:11:45,738
And when will you finally decide, Maria?

199
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:50,776
When you and Crisostomo are married?

200
00:11:57,783 --> 00:11:59,185
How did you learn about it?

201
00:12:12,465 --> 00:12:14,300
I'm warning you, Maria.

202
00:12:18,104 --> 00:12:21,340
If I still don't have
your fiancé's letters

203
00:12:22,641 --> 00:12:24,243
until tonight,

204
00:12:26,112 --> 00:12:28,414
I'll be forced to do what must be done.

205
00:12:30,683 --> 00:12:35,287
While you are having fun at your
formal proposal tonight,

206
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:40,760
your family's dirty secret
will be revealed.

207
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:47,166
Are you willing to sacrifice
your both fathers…

208
00:12:49,335 --> 00:12:50,503
for your fiancé's sake?

209
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:54,140
So, Maria…

210
00:12:58,911 --> 00:13:03,082
Maria Clara, stop protecting Crisostomo.

211
00:13:07,887 --> 00:13:09,822
But I'm telling you, Father,

212
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:13,526
those letters contain nothing

213
00:13:13,592 --> 00:13:15,761
except Crisostomo's love
confessions and sweet nothings.

214
00:13:20,499 --> 00:13:22,835
Until six o'clock tonight…

215
00:13:25,604 --> 00:13:26,972
And if not…

216
00:13:30,276 --> 00:13:31,911
prepare yourself…

217
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,182
for God's punishment

218
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:39,819
to your family.

219
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:47,393
Thank you,

220
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:50,095
Maria.

221
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:53,098
My Clarita.

222
00:13:57,469 --> 00:13:58,637
Thank you.

223
00:14:34,406 --> 00:14:35,541
Maria?

224
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:48,053
Klay?

225
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:50,256
What are you doing here?

226
00:14:51,357 --> 00:14:52,992
How were you able to get into our house?

227
00:14:54,627 --> 00:14:56,295
You know me, señorita.

228
00:14:57,963 --> 00:14:59,565
Actually, señorita

229
00:15:00,099 --> 00:15:02,935
I'm so worried about you
since the last time we met.

230
00:15:03,669 --> 00:15:06,272
That's why I went here to see you.

231
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:09,008
How are you?

232
00:15:11,377 --> 00:15:12,344
My namesake…

233
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:16,048
If your fiancé and family
are both in trouble,

234
00:15:17,216 --> 00:15:19,151
who among them will you save first?

235
00:15:20,653 --> 00:15:21,820
Your fiancé

236
00:15:22,521 --> 00:15:23,555
or your family?

237
00:15:29,361 --> 00:15:30,963
That's a tough question.

238
00:15:32,131 --> 00:15:34,833
Even Pia and Catriona would find
that question hard.

239
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:46,545
Of course, I would save my family first.

240
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:51,750
Because you only have one family.

241
00:15:54,853 --> 00:15:56,956
That's my answer too.

242
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:00,059
To save my family.

243
00:16:04,496 --> 00:16:05,965
Is that your problem?

244
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:14,740
Please tell Crisostomo
to postpone this formal wedding proposal.

245
00:16:16,608 --> 00:16:18,477
I cannot face him.

246
00:16:20,913 --> 00:16:22,548
What? I really don't understand.

247
00:16:22,614 --> 00:16:23,549
What's really happening?

248
00:16:24,116 --> 00:16:26,485
Just tell him that I love him very much.

249
00:16:28,887 --> 00:16:30,589
I just need to save my…

250
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:37,763
Just tell him that.
I hope he can forgive me.

251
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:41,166
Forgive you? For what?

252
00:16:41,233 --> 00:16:43,068
Señorita, you're making me nervous.

253
00:16:43,135 --> 00:16:44,770
What's really happening?

254
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:46,472
Go on.

255
00:16:46,538 --> 00:16:47,539
Leave now, Klay.

256
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,978
Make sure to tell him everything I said.

257
00:16:54,813 --> 00:16:56,215
Señorita, come on…

258
00:16:57,683 --> 00:17:00,085
We're friends, right?

259
00:17:00,886 --> 00:17:03,422
Why don't you tell me about your problem?

260
00:17:03,489 --> 00:17:04,723
I will help you!

261
00:17:06,325 --> 00:17:08,193
You can't help me, Klay.

262
00:17:09,595 --> 00:17:12,598
So please, leave now
before somebody sees you.

263
00:17:16,635 --> 00:17:17,503
Please.

264
00:17:30,349 --> 00:17:31,450
Go.

265
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:57,943
This is going to be scandalous
for Captain Tiago and your whole family.

266
00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:01,346
You can't tell Tiago about this.

267
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:04,716
Everything we worked hard for
will be ruined.

268
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:07,252
Do you understand, my child?

269
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,688
Whether your godfather agrees or not,

270
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:12,324
<i>we will confirm our fathers' agreement</i>

271
00:18:12,391 --> 00:18:13,692
<i>as soon as possible.</i>

272
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:16,061
<i>I will prepare a formal wedding proposal.</i>

273
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:51,597
Did Maria Clara tell you why she didn't
want to push through with this event?

274
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:55,701
That's the thing, sir.

275
00:18:57,236 --> 00:18:58,737
She didn't explain.

276
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:01,306
She just…

277
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:05,144
She said she must save her family first.

278
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:08,981
Something like that.
I didn't understand why.

279
00:19:11,383 --> 00:19:13,051
Sir, could it be that…

280
00:19:13,585 --> 00:19:16,188
Father Damaso threatened and forbade her

281
00:19:16,255 --> 00:19:19,124
from accepting and pushing through
with your wedding?

282
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:31,470
<i>Promise me…</i>

283
00:19:32,037 --> 00:19:34,806
that you will always keep our love
with you…

284
00:19:34,873 --> 00:19:36,408
including this rosary.

285
00:19:54,426 --> 00:19:57,362
These main leads' story is so complicated.

286
00:19:58,597 --> 00:20:00,098
Wait, sir, I'm coming with you.

287
00:20:03,435 --> 00:20:04,603
Fidel!

288
00:20:07,439 --> 00:20:10,375
Do you really have
to stalk me all day long?

289
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:13,178
There's something important you must know.

290
00:20:14,813 --> 00:20:16,014
I saw Ms. Sisa.

291
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:19,084
It seems she escaped from the hospice.

292
00:20:19,151 --> 00:20:21,486
And she still has chains on her leg.

293
00:20:22,654 --> 00:20:23,855
Ms. Sisa?

294
00:20:25,123 --> 00:20:27,359
What happened to her?
Why did you not bring her here?

295
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,394
I tried.

296
00:20:29,461 --> 00:20:30,929
But she ran away.

297
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:36,068
We need to find her.

298
00:20:36,134 --> 00:20:39,504
But I also need to talk to Maria Clara
as soon as possible.

299
00:20:41,673 --> 00:20:43,342
All right, sir, don't worry.

300
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:45,143
I will look for Ms. Sisa.

301
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:47,145
Just stay focused on Maria Clara.

302
00:20:47,713 --> 00:20:50,315
Ah, I'll accompany Ms. Klay, my friend.

303
00:20:53,552 --> 00:20:54,553
That's good to know.

304
00:20:55,554 --> 00:20:56,722
How clingy!

305
00:20:57,889 --> 00:20:59,358
But, fine.

306
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:02,461
I might also need your help
if Ms. Sisa resists.

307
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:07,266
Sir Ibarra, please take care.

308
00:21:07,332 --> 00:21:09,301
Good luck conversing with Maria Clara.

309
00:21:11,903 --> 00:21:13,705
Update me Fidel, whatever happens.

310
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,041
Goodbye.

311
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:28,086
What are you staring at?

312
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:29,888
Let's go.

313
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:50,709
Andeng,

314
00:21:51,376 --> 00:21:52,577
leave us alone, please.

315
00:22:15,467 --> 00:22:16,868
My mother's letter?

316
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:33,885
Good girl, Maria.

317
00:22:35,754 --> 00:22:36,688
Good girl.

318
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:50,702
Where could Ms. Sisa be right now?

319
00:22:51,269 --> 00:22:53,071
I saw her here a while ago.

320
00:22:56,308 --> 00:22:57,943
Fidel, what's the date today?

321
00:22:58,009 --> 00:22:59,378
Why are there lanterns already?

322
00:23:00,412 --> 00:23:01,813
It's December, Ms. Klay.

323
00:23:03,415 --> 00:23:04,783
Christmas is approaching.

324
00:23:13,258 --> 00:23:15,127
Is it also Christmas time in my world?

325
00:23:16,661 --> 00:23:18,797
Such a pity if I won't be
back home by then.

326
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:24,269
What are you thinking, Ms. Klay?

327
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:27,672
Nothing.

328
00:23:28,206 --> 00:23:31,977
Come on. Let's finish whatever mission
I have here, so I can go home.

329
00:23:34,713 --> 00:23:35,614
Home?

330
00:23:36,381 --> 00:23:37,983
Ms. Klay, where will you go home?

331
00:23:39,484 --> 00:23:40,786
Is it to another time?

332
00:23:45,056 --> 00:23:47,159
A future that you made up

333
00:23:47,993 --> 00:23:49,961
to mock and make fun of me.

334
00:23:51,329 --> 00:23:53,598
I knew you wouldn't believe me either.

335
00:23:54,166 --> 00:23:55,534
How can I believe the shenanigans

336
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:59,104
of a woman who knows
how to trick me very well

337
00:23:59,171 --> 00:24:00,972
because I'm already in love with her?

338
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:02,641
Hold on. Why are you mad again?

339
00:24:02,707 --> 00:24:04,709
Do I force you to have those feelings?

340
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:05,944
Then don't…

341
00:24:06,011 --> 00:24:07,312
Don't toy with me.

342
00:24:07,379 --> 00:24:09,481
I am not toying with you!

343
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:12,617
If you don't want to believe me,
then fine!

344
00:24:12,684 --> 00:24:13,952
Bye!

345
00:24:14,019 --> 00:24:15,153
Wait, Ms. Klay.

346
00:24:15,654 --> 00:24:18,957
I said don't toy with me!

347
00:24:20,859 --> 00:24:23,061
If you want to make it
harder for me to woo you,

348
00:24:23,595 --> 00:24:25,130
then I will accept that!

349
00:24:25,197 --> 00:24:27,299
If you want to order me around…

350
00:24:27,365 --> 00:24:28,567
to chop wood for you

351
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:30,635
or I will fetch water from
the stream or the well…

352
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:32,904
I will do those things.

353
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:36,041
I will do everything for you, Ms. Klay.

354
00:24:38,276 --> 00:24:39,945
Just don't make a fool out of me!

355
00:24:53,124 --> 00:24:54,125
Let's…

356
00:24:55,227 --> 00:24:58,363
continue looking for… Ms. Sisa.

357
00:25:06,805 --> 00:25:08,673
He looks handsome when he's angry.

358
00:25:11,977 --> 00:25:14,145
Maria Clara Infantes, don't give in.

359
00:25:14,212 --> 00:25:15,814
Don't fall for him.

360
00:25:15,881 --> 00:25:17,215
Don't go crazy!

361
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:20,452
Ms. Klay?

362
00:25:22,988 --> 00:25:25,490
Why are you hurting yourself?

363
00:25:27,792 --> 00:25:29,194
Nothing.

364
00:25:29,261 --> 00:25:30,262
Let's go.

365
00:25:31,496 --> 00:25:33,532
Let's continue looking for Ms. Sisa.

366
00:26:00,792 --> 00:26:02,127
<i>Father…</i>

367
00:26:02,761 --> 00:26:04,896
<i>in the past six years,</i>

368
00:26:04,963 --> 00:26:08,433
<i>Santiago and I couldn't bear a child.</i>

369
00:26:09,434 --> 00:26:13,972
<i>However, we became blessed
when we moved to San Diego</i>

370
00:26:14,639 --> 00:26:17,042
<i>and you became our friend.</i>

371
00:26:19,544 --> 00:26:21,846
Father, please accept this small amount.

372
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:24,583
May it help in the finances of the church.

373
00:26:25,617 --> 00:26:29,721
God bless you, Don Tiago, Doña Pia.

374
00:26:29,788 --> 00:26:32,324
May your words come true, Father.

375
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:34,526
I hope that we will be blessed
with a child soon.

376
00:26:39,164 --> 00:26:40,865
My God, Tiago.

377
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:49,040
Maybe you should come
with me to Obando, Doña Pia.

378
00:26:50,141 --> 00:26:53,979
We will ask the patron saint for
the blessing that you seek.

379
00:26:55,213 --> 00:26:57,916
<i>It seems that my husband's dream came true</i>

380
00:26:58,583 --> 00:27:00,285
<i>when I got pregnant.</i>

381
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:06,625
<i>But he doesn't have a clue
on how the baby in my womb was made,</i>

382
00:27:07,158 --> 00:27:12,063
<i>that the child I was carrying
is a product of your wickedness!</i>

383
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:27,145
Forgive me, Father Damaso,

384
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:31,049
but why are we doing the confession here?

385
00:27:31,116 --> 00:27:32,083
Don't worry.

386
00:27:34,586 --> 00:27:35,787
Trust me.

387
00:27:40,525 --> 00:27:41,726
Father Damaso!

388
00:27:41,793 --> 00:27:42,927
Father Damaso, please!

389
00:27:44,963 --> 00:27:46,898
Father Damaso!

390
00:27:46,965 --> 00:27:50,035
<i>Do you remember the day</i>
<i>that you violated me?</i>

391
00:27:51,636 --> 00:27:54,205
<i>You're vicious, Friar!</i>

392
00:27:55,807 --> 00:27:58,877
Father Damaso, please!

393
00:27:59,377 --> 00:28:02,514
Please no, Father Damaso!

394
00:28:40,185 --> 00:28:41,352
No, no, Consolacion.

395
00:28:41,419 --> 00:28:42,754
You will not come with me.

396
00:28:42,821 --> 00:28:45,824
Why don't you want me to be with you
at the feast you're attending?

397
00:28:46,825 --> 00:28:48,460
Look at yourself!

398
00:28:49,828 --> 00:28:52,363
You will just embarrass me
in front of people!

399
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:53,932
Please!

400
00:28:53,998 --> 00:28:56,101
-Love, please!
-No, Consolacion!

401
00:28:56,167 --> 00:28:58,369
-I said no!
-I'm coming with you!

402
00:29:00,138 --> 00:29:02,674
If you're not going to stop.
I will leave you.

403
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:06,745
Let us see if you will not go back
to being a laundress!

404
00:29:24,963 --> 00:29:26,531
Basilio?

405
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:29,667
Crispin?

406
00:29:31,202 --> 00:29:33,037
Where are you, my sons?

407
00:29:35,907 --> 00:29:37,475
Hey, Sisa!

408
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:39,644
Come here!

409
00:29:39,711 --> 00:29:41,112
Come up here. Your sons are here.

410
00:29:43,648 --> 00:29:45,283
My sons are there?

411
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:46,985
Yes, come here.

412
00:29:47,051 --> 00:29:47,919
Hurry!

413
00:30:13,411 --> 00:30:15,213
My God, Clarita.

414
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:17,048
Why aren't you dressed yet?

415
00:30:20,385 --> 00:30:22,120
Clarita, do you hear me?

416
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:24,088
What is happening to you?

417
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:26,057
Crisostomo is already outside.

418
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:39,437
Good evening, Maria.

419
00:30:40,772 --> 00:30:42,774
It seems like you are not
dressed yet, Maria.

420
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:47,312
Can you please me and my fiancé alone?

421
00:31:04,329 --> 00:31:05,263
Maria.

422
00:31:07,966 --> 00:31:09,634
What's wrong with you and…

423
00:31:11,069 --> 00:31:13,538
you want to postpone this
formal wedding proposal.

424
00:31:23,181 --> 00:31:24,515
Please, Maria…

425
00:31:25,583 --> 00:31:29,020
can you tell me what's bothering you?

426
00:31:33,124 --> 00:31:34,959
I am no longer a woman

427
00:31:36,261 --> 00:31:37,729
deserving of…

428
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:41,232
an honorable man like you.

429
00:31:45,136 --> 00:31:46,471
Especially now,

430
00:31:47,705 --> 00:31:49,007
because I did something

431
00:31:50,275 --> 00:31:52,810
really horrible to you.

432
00:31:57,782 --> 00:31:59,918
I don't deserve to be your fiancé anymore.

433
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:02,654
But I will not back out

434
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,822
no matter what you have done.

435
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:06,724
I will understand you.

436
00:32:07,825 --> 00:32:09,394
Tell me the truth.

437
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,436
There are important things
that Father Salvi

438
00:32:20,805 --> 00:32:22,340
asked me to give him.

439
00:32:26,678 --> 00:32:28,079
Your letters.

440
00:32:31,582 --> 00:32:33,851
In exchange for my mother's.

441
00:32:40,525 --> 00:32:42,894
And I gave them to him, Crisostomo.

442
00:32:46,064 --> 00:32:48,066
I betrayed you, my love.

443
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:52,670
I handed…

444
00:32:52,737 --> 00:32:55,907
I handed your letters to the curate.

445
00:32:58,409 --> 00:33:00,611
Forgive me, my love.

446
00:33:00,678 --> 00:33:01,779
Forgive me.

447
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:07,852
I'm so sorry, Crisostomo.

448
00:33:14,392 --> 00:33:15,660
Dance, woman!

449
00:33:15,727 --> 00:33:16,761
Dance!

450
00:33:19,263 --> 00:33:20,865
Sing!

451
00:33:20,932 --> 00:33:21,966
Sing!

452
00:33:27,939 --> 00:33:29,340
Why did you stop?

453
00:33:30,708 --> 00:33:32,110
I said,

454
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:34,912
dance, woman! Dance!

455
00:33:36,047 --> 00:33:38,750
But you said my sons are here.

456
00:33:40,051 --> 00:33:41,853
Where are my sons?

457
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:44,222
-I said…
-Where are…

458
00:33:45,089 --> 00:33:46,357
sing.

459
00:33:46,424 --> 00:33:49,193
My sons are not here.

460
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:53,197
Stand up!

461
00:34:01,973 --> 00:34:03,775
Dance and sing!

462
00:34:04,609 --> 00:34:06,077
Stand up!

463
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:21,793
Miss, have you seen Ms. Sisa?

464
00:34:21,859 --> 00:34:23,461
The woman who has lost her mind.

465
00:34:26,063 --> 00:34:27,165
Thank you.

466
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:31,035
Ms. Klay, we shouldn't stop
looking for her.

467
00:34:32,336 --> 00:34:35,173
Señor, I need your help.

468
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:37,375
The alferez is busy.

469
00:34:37,442 --> 00:34:39,977
Can you please come with me

470
00:34:40,044 --> 00:34:43,081
and save Ms. Sisa
from Señora Consolacion.

471
00:34:43,147 --> 00:34:45,016
I don't give a damn about that Sisa.

472
00:34:46,384 --> 00:34:47,485
Wait…

473
00:34:48,152 --> 00:34:50,555
is this the woman who has gone mad?

474
00:34:50,621 --> 00:34:51,889
Yes, it's her.

475
00:34:54,058 --> 00:34:54,992
Me!

476
00:34:55,059 --> 00:34:57,562
We will help her. Take us to her now.

477
00:34:57,628 --> 00:34:58,763
Let's go.

478
00:35:08,372 --> 00:35:10,141
Sing and dance!

479
00:35:11,843 --> 00:35:13,111
Dance.

480
00:35:17,415 --> 00:35:18,416
Dance.

481
00:35:20,585 --> 00:35:21,752
Help me,

482
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:28,326
forget my terrible fate.

483
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,008
Dance!

484
00:36:01,559 --> 00:36:02,927
Forgive me, Crisostomo.

485
00:36:05,863 --> 00:36:08,933
He threatened me,
that's why I was forced to do it.

486
00:36:14,405 --> 00:36:17,074
If I don't give those letters to him,

487
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:24,515
my father and godfather will be ruined
and humiliated in front of everyone.

488
00:36:35,493 --> 00:36:36,627
Hush now.

489
00:36:37,361 --> 00:36:38,763
Hush now, my love.

490
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:44,769
I don't remember writing
anything in my letters

491
00:36:44,835 --> 00:36:46,204
that would put me in a bad light.

492
00:36:48,406 --> 00:36:50,508
I'm sure of what he's after.

493
00:36:51,275 --> 00:36:53,778
Because he wants to find anything
that is subversive.

494
00:36:55,947 --> 00:36:57,582
So, don't worry,

495
00:36:58,783 --> 00:37:00,751
because I understand that.

496
00:37:04,188 --> 00:37:05,056
But…

497
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:07,658
what's in your mother's letter

498
00:37:07,725 --> 00:37:11,662
that you said will ruin your father
and the curate?

499
00:37:38,356 --> 00:37:40,424
Please trust me, Maria.

500
00:37:49,333 --> 00:37:51,035
After you read it,

501
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:54,372
then you decide

502
00:37:55,339 --> 00:37:58,109
if I am still worthy of you.

503
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:27,672
Keep dancing!

504
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:33,778
Just please don't tell her
that I'm the one who told you.

505
00:38:33,844 --> 00:38:34,812
Thank you.

506
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:37,581
Sing!

507
00:38:45,923 --> 00:38:47,658
Sing!

508
00:38:47,725 --> 00:38:48,659
Stop!

509
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,027
Ms. Sisa!

510
00:38:50,561 --> 00:38:51,796
Stop it now!

511
00:38:51,862 --> 00:38:53,230
You are ruthless, Missus!

512
00:38:53,297 --> 00:38:55,733
How dare you barge into my home?

513
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,968
Leave the madwoman and go away!

514
00:38:58,035 --> 00:38:59,837
Who is the real madwoman here?

515
00:39:00,438 --> 00:39:03,040
You who toy with someone
who's mentally ill?

516
00:39:03,641 --> 00:39:05,209
You have no pity!

517
00:39:05,776 --> 00:39:09,246
How dare you talk back
to me in my own home?

518
00:39:09,313 --> 00:39:11,082
I will teach you a lesson!

519
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:13,951
You too!

520
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:16,554
My husband will hear about this!

521
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:18,389
He'll have you arrested
by the civil guards!

522
00:39:18,456 --> 00:39:21,592
Don't pretend to be someone
powerful, Missus.

523
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:25,963
Everyone in San Diego knows that
the General is ashamed of you.

524
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:29,934
So, I think he wouldn't ruin
our friendship.

525
00:39:31,001 --> 00:39:33,971
Especially if it is because of you,

526
00:39:34,038 --> 00:39:35,573
whom he doesn't value.

527
00:39:40,478 --> 00:39:42,847
Ms. Klay, let's go.

528
00:40:06,003 --> 00:40:08,305
Is it not enough that he said

529
00:40:08,372 --> 00:40:11,175
that the reason his father sent
him to study in Europe

530
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:15,146
is so he can use what he learned
to serve our town?

531
00:40:15,646 --> 00:40:18,215
Isn't that subversive, Father?

532
00:40:23,654 --> 00:40:25,990
You did learn how to read a little,

533
00:40:26,056 --> 00:40:27,658
but you can't understand!

534
00:40:28,392 --> 00:40:29,894
What a waste!

535
00:40:30,661 --> 00:40:31,796
That's not enough!

536
00:40:31,862 --> 00:40:37,268
We just wasted our time reading
Crisostomo Ibarra's letters!

537
00:40:39,036 --> 00:40:40,504
Not even one sentence

538
00:40:41,405 --> 00:40:45,409
said that he wants to fight
and bring down the government.

539
00:40:45,476 --> 00:40:46,444
Nothing!

540
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:51,115
Father, Señor Ibarra's penmanship

541
00:40:51,615 --> 00:40:53,617
is almost the same as yours.

542
00:40:58,989 --> 00:41:00,891
Well, look here…

543
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:06,630
a Native with a little knowledge
on writing and reading.

544
00:41:08,165 --> 00:41:10,100
Who would have thought

545
00:41:10,167 --> 00:41:13,637
that you would give me a good idea?

546
00:41:18,375 --> 00:41:22,813
It looks like your path to
heaven is all set, Renato.

547
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,248
Very good.

548
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:25,216
Good job.

549
00:41:25,816 --> 00:41:27,117
All right.

550
00:41:27,184 --> 00:41:28,752
You can leave now.

551
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:31,522
I will just call you when I need you.

552
00:41:32,022 --> 00:41:33,257
Yes. Yes, Father.

553
00:41:33,824 --> 00:41:34,825
Very good!

554
00:41:34,892 --> 00:41:35,726
Good…

555
00:41:36,427 --> 00:41:37,261
job.

556
00:41:46,837 --> 00:41:50,508
I can already see my triumph, Maria.

557
00:41:52,977 --> 00:41:56,914
I'm still grateful for your letters

558
00:41:57,615 --> 00:42:00,818
because I can now fabricate evidence

559
00:42:00,885 --> 00:42:05,189
of anti-government ideology.

560
00:42:08,092 --> 00:42:12,429
And your Crisostomo Ibarra
as the mastermind…

561
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:18,936
and involved
in the rebels' upcoming attack.

562
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:24,875
Let's see if you
and your beloved's wedding

563
00:42:24,942 --> 00:42:26,877
will still push through…

564
00:42:28,312 --> 00:42:31,282
or if he will rot in prison.

565
00:43:01,679 --> 00:43:04,148
<i>I had a bad dream about Sir Ibarra.</i>

566
00:43:04,214 --> 00:43:05,616
<i>It was just a dream.</i>

567
00:43:06,283 --> 00:43:07,284
Then again,

568
00:43:07,351 --> 00:43:11,522
my friend is more important
to you than me.

569
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:12,523
Jealous?

570
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:18,796
<i>What's this parable that
we are witnessing in our town?</i>

571
00:43:18,862 --> 00:43:22,466
<i>Vultures rarely come here.</i>

572
00:43:23,233 --> 00:43:24,301
<i>Tomorrow night,</i>

573
00:43:24,368 --> 00:43:29,940
<i>Crisostomo Ibarra
will be tagged as a delinquent.</i>

574
00:43:30,007 --> 00:43:31,208
COMING UP

575
00:43:33,377 --> 00:43:35,980
