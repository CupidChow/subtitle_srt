00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:31,364
MARIA CLARA AND IBARRA

2
00:00:31,431 --> 00:00:35,568
THIS PROGRAM, WHICH IS ADAPTED
FROM THE NOVELS OF DR. JOSE P. RIZAL,

3
00:00:35,635 --> 00:00:40,573
IS PRESENTED USING DRAMATIC ELEMENTS
TO CONNECT THE PRESENT AND THE PAST

4
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:46,312
IN A SPECIAL REIMAGINING OF THE NATIONAL
LITERATURE FILIPINOS ARE PROUD OF.

5
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:48,381
<i>I really need to find that book.</i>

6
00:00:48,448 --> 00:00:49,549
<i>Where is it?</i>

7
00:00:54,954 --> 00:00:56,656
The way I fan myself conveys a message.

8
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:57,991
Why? What does that mean?

9
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:00,493
-"I adore you."
-Who is it?

10
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,761
It's…

11
00:01:01,828 --> 00:01:03,496
-Fidel.
-Don't you have gym class?

12
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:06,366
-<i>Go ahead. I'm good.</i>
-<i>Yes. Good luck finding the book.</i>

13
00:01:06,433 --> 00:01:08,034
-<i>Okay?</i>
-<i>Señor Simoun?</i>

14
00:01:08,101 --> 00:01:10,203
<i>Is there anything
I can help you with, Señor?</i>

15
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:11,738
<i>You know who I am.</i>

16
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:14,674
<i>I am not just Simoun, the jeweler.</i>

17
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:15,842
<i>I am…</i>

18
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:19,846
the judge who wants
to castigate a system

19
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:22,182
by making use of its defects

20
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:24,350
that's why I need your help.

21
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:26,352
From all of the youth.

22
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:30,423
<i>Mr. Torres, I have an idea of what
will happen to the characters of</i> El Fili.

23
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:31,858
<i>I've read the book.</i>

24
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:34,661
<i>But now, Mr. Torres, I need to go back.</i>

25
00:01:34,727 --> 00:01:36,329
<i>I have to go back there again.</i>

26
00:01:36,396 --> 00:01:38,698
I need to save the characters
in the story.

27
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:40,867
I need to save my friends!

28
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:42,735
<i>Here we go again, Ms. Infantes.</i>

29
00:01:42,802 --> 00:01:45,138
<i>You can't change the past.</i>

30
00:01:45,205 --> 00:01:46,272
<i>It is already written!</i>

31
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,429
Oh, my goodness!

32
00:02:09,496 --> 00:02:12,398
What kind of gimmick is this, Mr. Torres?

33
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:19,906
PREVIOUSLY

34
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:36,055
Oh, gosh! Where did I put…

35
00:02:36,756 --> 00:02:38,024
There!

36
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:54,474
Hello?

37
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:55,542
Oh?

38
00:02:55,608 --> 00:02:56,876
Oh, Barry?

39
00:02:56,943 --> 00:02:58,478
Are you with Pido?

40
00:02:59,946 --> 00:03:01,848
Okay, all right. I'm on my way.

41
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:13,359
Gosh.

42
00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:38,751
Hey! This is crazy! You almost got caught!

43
00:03:39,452 --> 00:03:41,521
Don't worry.
I don't think he saw anything.

44
00:03:42,021 --> 00:03:44,490
Are you sure?
I don't want to get expelled.

45
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:46,960
Yes, just relax.

46
00:03:48,027 --> 00:03:51,231
I promise. I won't do this again.
This will be the last time, okay?

47
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,004
I found it.

48
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:04,244
So, what's magical about that book?

49
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:06,813
Aside from being old and worn out?

50
00:04:08,314 --> 00:04:10,149
It's hard to explain, Stacy.

51
00:04:12,385 --> 00:04:15,555
All I know is, this is my last chance
to fix everything.

52
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:19,726
-Let's go.
-Come on.

53
00:04:25,231 --> 00:04:26,599
It was you again.

54
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:30,570
Who dare to trespass the second novel.

55
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,609
Ms. Maria Clara Infantes.

56
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:38,444
It seems that…

57
00:04:39,412 --> 00:04:41,648
I will be involved again because of you.

58
00:05:02,502 --> 00:05:03,503
Klay!

59
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:05,004
Klay!

60
00:05:08,741 --> 00:05:09,842
Klay?

61
00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:12,912
She's asleep.

62
00:05:28,461 --> 00:05:30,163
Klay.

63
00:05:34,701 --> 00:05:35,702
Fidel.

64
00:05:38,738 --> 00:05:40,106
Klay, wake up.

65
00:05:44,877 --> 00:05:46,446
Klay…

66
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:47,580
It's time for breakfast.

67
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:51,184
Did it work?

68
00:05:51,784 --> 00:05:53,353
Am I in <i>El Fili</i> now?

69
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:56,022
Huh?

70
00:05:56,089 --> 00:05:58,191
What are you talking about, Klay?

71
00:06:00,793 --> 00:06:01,894
Why?

72
00:06:04,997 --> 00:06:06,232
I'm still here?

73
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:10,136
Are you having a nightmare again?

74
00:06:15,808 --> 00:06:17,110
Who's Fidel?

75
00:06:17,977 --> 00:06:19,379
Your boyfriend?

76
00:06:20,413 --> 00:06:23,216
-No. Ouch!
-My sister has a boyfriend!

77
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,852
I'll tell Mom!

78
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:27,887
-Gosh! Hey!
-Mom!

79
00:06:27,954 --> 00:06:30,056
-Mom!
-No, no! Don't!

80
00:06:30,123 --> 00:06:31,657
Don't tell Mom, okay?

81
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:32,658
Promise?

82
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:34,861
-Promise me?
-Yes.

83
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:38,664
-Promise.
-Gosh!

84
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:40,032
-Mom!
-Hey!

85
00:06:40,099 --> 00:06:41,367
-Elias!
-Mom!

86
00:06:51,978 --> 00:06:53,479
Why am I still here?

87
00:06:56,649 --> 00:06:59,118
Why haven't been transported yet?
Did I do something wrong?

88
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,347
Transmigra…

89
00:07:28,414 --> 00:07:30,149
Transmigration.

90
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:33,553
So, it's called transmigration.

91
00:07:40,426 --> 00:07:41,461
What are you doing?

92
00:07:42,862 --> 00:07:45,731
I'm doing some research on transmigration.

93
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:49,135
Transmi…

94
00:07:50,169 --> 00:07:51,070
What?

95
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:57,477
That's what happens when you
get transported into a book.

96
00:07:57,543 --> 00:07:59,445
In a novel. Just like this.

97
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:03,583
It's been a trend in anime,
and on Wattpad.

98
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,586
Does that happen?

99
00:08:07,186 --> 00:08:09,288
Yes! It happened to me--

100
00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:13,326
Never mind.

101
00:08:22,268 --> 00:08:23,336
Really?

102
00:08:23,936 --> 00:08:25,404
Do I have to die first?

103
00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:28,407
That's too much!

104
00:08:28,474 --> 00:08:30,276
I was able to do it without dying.

105
00:08:33,212 --> 00:08:35,214
Fort Santiago…

106
00:08:37,483 --> 00:08:39,385
Portals in…

107
00:08:40,086 --> 00:08:41,187
Fort Santiago?

108
00:08:43,756 --> 00:08:45,057
Is this real or fake news?

109
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:51,297
There's nothing to lose if I try, right?

110
00:08:59,972 --> 00:09:01,240
Right here?

111
00:09:10,783 --> 00:09:11,617
Here?

112
00:09:16,188 --> 00:09:17,456
What's happening?

113
00:09:17,523 --> 00:09:19,458
I don't understand!

114
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:22,461
Earlier, I went to Fort Santiago.

115
00:09:22,528 --> 00:09:23,863
And now, I'm here.

116
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:25,498
I went to all the portals.

117
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,366
Why is there no progress?

118
00:09:29,936 --> 00:09:31,437
Why am I still here?

119
00:09:34,173 --> 00:09:37,076
Why can't I enter the book yet?

120
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:47,753
Hello, girl?

121
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,622
<i>Girl, where are you?</i>

122
00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:50,590
Why?

123
00:09:50,656 --> 00:09:51,857
<i>Come here!</i>

124
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:53,593
<i>Mr. Torres is looking for you.</i>

125
00:09:55,461 --> 00:09:56,295
Why?

126
00:09:56,362 --> 00:09:58,497
<i>He's looking for the book.</i>

127
00:09:58,564 --> 00:10:00,333
<i>I knew he would find out!</i>

128
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,335
<i>And you're the prime suspect!</i>

129
00:10:05,037 --> 00:10:06,305
What did you tell him?

130
00:10:06,372 --> 00:10:09,241
<i>Of course, I acted
as if I didn't know anything.</i>

131
00:10:09,308 --> 00:10:11,911
<i>Come here now! Hurry!</i>

132
00:10:11,978 --> 00:10:13,312
All right. Okay. I'm on my way.

133
00:10:49,515 --> 00:10:50,483
Mister Torres.

134
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:52,318
You're looking for me?

135
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:53,953
Ah, yes.

136
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,154
Earlier, when I arrived,

137
00:10:55,221 --> 00:10:58,124
I noticed there was something
missing from my belongings.

138
00:10:58,858 --> 00:11:00,026
A significant one.

139
00:11:01,727 --> 00:11:03,963
The copy of <i>El Filibusterismo,</i>

140
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:05,364
that you kept asking me for.

141
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:08,401
It's missing?

142
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:10,436
Yes.

143
00:11:12,038 --> 00:11:12,972
Gosh.

144
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:14,707
Are you sure, sir?

145
00:11:14,774 --> 00:11:15,975
Maybe you just misplaced it.

146
00:11:18,377 --> 00:11:20,279
Maybe you know something, Ms. Klay?

147
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:23,449
Do you know where the book is?

148
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,362
No, I don't know anything.

149
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:39,065
Are you sure?

150
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:41,267
Of course.

151
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:43,903
I just stayed at home last night.

152
00:11:45,638 --> 00:11:48,441
If it was you who took it, just admit it.

153
00:11:50,109 --> 00:11:52,211
You're the only one
I know who would take it.

154
00:11:54,513 --> 00:11:56,215
Sir, trust me.

155
00:11:56,282 --> 00:11:57,450
I don't have it.

156
00:11:57,516 --> 00:11:58,517
Promise!

157
00:12:01,287 --> 00:12:02,154
Okay.

158
00:12:06,358 --> 00:12:07,827
-Miss Klay.
-Yes?

159
00:12:09,528 --> 00:12:10,696
Just a warning.

160
00:12:11,764 --> 00:12:13,165
Don't mess with fate.

161
00:12:14,433 --> 00:12:15,868
Because instead of helping,

162
00:12:16,535 --> 00:12:18,437
you might worsen the situation.

163
00:12:42,661 --> 00:12:43,562
Thank you.

164
00:12:52,338 --> 00:12:53,272
Klay.

165
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:56,342
I have something to tell you.

166
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:01,914
I'm sure you'll be proud of me.

167
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:05,384
What is it?

168
00:13:07,586 --> 00:13:08,721
Did you know…

169
00:13:10,556 --> 00:13:12,825
I dared to stand up to your Uncle Ronald.

170
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:17,062
I told him…

171
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:20,099
that if he…

172
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:22,368
humiliates and hurts me again,

173
00:13:24,537 --> 00:13:26,872
I will leave him immediately.

174
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:32,011
I will not allow him to control me again.

175
00:13:36,715 --> 00:13:38,651
You said that?

176
00:13:45,024 --> 00:13:46,158
It's because…

177
00:13:47,526 --> 00:13:49,461
I've been thinking lately…

178
00:13:50,563 --> 00:13:51,530
about the

179
00:13:52,431 --> 00:13:54,099
realizations that you've said.

180
00:13:58,237 --> 00:14:00,372
For a long time,

181
00:14:00,439 --> 00:14:02,842
I've been experiencing this pain.

182
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:05,177
We all experience it.

183
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:09,348
That…

184
00:14:10,883 --> 00:14:14,019
Even though he's
the man in our relationship,

185
00:14:14,086 --> 00:14:15,688
he should respect me.

186
00:14:19,325 --> 00:14:20,326
as a person…

187
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:22,862
as a woman…

188
00:14:26,732 --> 00:14:27,967
and as your mother.

189
00:14:46,352 --> 00:14:47,419
It's tough…

190
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:56,862
I don't know if I can uphold it.

191
00:15:01,867 --> 00:15:03,035
It's tough.

192
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,282
As long as you're with me.

193
00:15:17,516 --> 00:15:19,418
Both you and Elias.

194
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,161
Oh?

195
00:15:31,163 --> 00:15:32,164
Why?

196
00:15:33,065 --> 00:15:34,533
You don't want to be with me?

197
00:15:35,234 --> 00:15:36,835
Is there a problem?

198
00:15:36,902 --> 00:15:38,938
Ah, did I say something wrong?

199
00:15:39,004 --> 00:15:40,372
No, nothing, Mom.

200
00:15:42,207 --> 00:15:45,711
I… just have my problem.

201
00:15:47,346 --> 00:15:48,480
What is it?

202
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:58,457
It's hard to explain.

203
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,329
You might think I'm going insane.

204
00:16:05,097 --> 00:16:06,966
Maybe I'm actually insane.

205
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,401
Klay…

206
00:16:10,569 --> 00:16:12,071
I'm your mom.

207
00:16:13,038 --> 00:16:14,273
Whatever it is,

208
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,809
even if it's nonsense…

209
00:16:17,376 --> 00:16:18,711
Or craziness…

210
00:16:19,745 --> 00:16:21,714
You can tell me.

211
00:16:34,226 --> 00:16:36,528
I really want to help…

212
00:16:38,797 --> 00:16:39,832
my friends.

213
00:16:45,904 --> 00:16:49,241
But in my situation now,
it seems there's nothing I can do.

214
00:16:56,148 --> 00:16:59,918
Why? Where are your friends?

215
00:17:02,154 --> 00:17:03,489
They live far away.

216
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:06,725
Not here.

217
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,835
Should I give up now, Mom?

218
00:17:18,637 --> 00:17:22,141
I don't know how I can help you, Klay.

219
00:17:25,177 --> 00:17:26,345
But…

220
00:17:28,914 --> 00:17:31,483
Maybe the solution to that problem

221
00:17:33,752 --> 00:17:35,254
is just there?

222
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:39,191
It's just like…

223
00:17:40,592 --> 00:17:42,127
when you're on a trip…

224
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:45,631
you've already passed by it,

225
00:17:47,132 --> 00:17:48,500
you just didn't notice.

226
00:17:52,004 --> 00:17:53,205
Come again?

227
00:17:57,743 --> 00:18:00,546
Mother Tasya used to tell me this,

228
00:18:03,782 --> 00:18:05,250
"Sometimes,

229
00:18:05,784 --> 00:18:08,720
you just need to go back
to where you came from."

230
00:18:08,787 --> 00:18:10,255
"Sometimes,

231
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,892
you need to start at the beginning

232
00:18:15,828 --> 00:18:18,063
for you to arrive
at where you want to be."

233
00:18:22,334 --> 00:18:24,002
It's difficult to understand, right?

234
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:26,672
It's difficult.

235
00:18:26,738 --> 00:18:28,140
But you will get it.

236
00:18:29,475 --> 00:18:31,009
Sorry, Klay, it's confusing.

237
00:18:31,743 --> 00:18:33,078
I'm just confusing you.

238
00:18:33,145 --> 00:18:34,613
No, no.

239
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:41,220
I'll ask for a straw.

240
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:42,421
Oh, okay.

241
00:18:49,228 --> 00:18:50,496
Start…

242
00:18:55,167 --> 00:18:56,935
Start at the beginning.

243
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:13,752
Is there no chance for me at all?

244
00:19:15,087 --> 00:19:16,755
I can't go back there anymore.

245
00:19:22,761 --> 00:19:24,396
What now? Should I just quit?

246
00:20:23,589 --> 00:20:24,623
"Sometimes…

247
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:27,226
you need to start at the beginning

248
00:20:27,292 --> 00:20:29,595
for you to arrive
at where you want to be."

249
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:41,740
Where did it all start?

250
00:20:44,543 --> 00:20:45,811
Or who started it?

251
00:21:17,876 --> 00:21:19,911
Maybe Rizal can answer my question.

252
00:21:38,363 --> 00:21:39,998
Okay.

253
00:22:24,643 --> 00:22:25,711
Here I am, Rizal.

254
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:28,914
I'm begging you.

255
00:22:29,581 --> 00:22:31,350
If Mr. Torres is making this hard for me,

256
00:22:31,416 --> 00:22:35,721
maybe you're the key
that will bring me back inside your book.

257
00:22:36,822 --> 00:22:37,856
Okay.

258
00:23:01,413 --> 00:23:02,614
Am I already here?

259
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:06,885
Huh?

260
00:23:10,188 --> 00:23:11,423
What did I do before?

261
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:12,624
It was open.

262
00:23:12,691 --> 00:23:13,859
Okay.

263
00:23:46,625 --> 00:23:48,527
Why is it like this, Rizal?

264
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:55,233
Why do you keep me hanging like this?

265
00:24:00,539 --> 00:24:03,041
You're ruthless to your characters!

266
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:07,512
Why do they have to die?

267
00:24:08,246 --> 00:24:10,449
Why do they have to kill each other?

268
00:24:14,219 --> 00:24:15,687
You know what, I'm sorry.

269
00:24:18,223 --> 00:24:20,725
I'm not saying
that your book is not good.

270
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:23,728
It's very good,
that's why I want to go back.

271
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:25,297
I want to help them!

272
00:24:25,363 --> 00:24:29,301
And I wouldn't be frustrated like this

273
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:32,237
if you gave them a happy ending.

274
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:43,715
Rizal…

275
00:24:45,617 --> 00:24:46,618
Please.

276
00:24:49,588 --> 00:24:51,189
I am begging you.

277
00:24:53,725 --> 00:24:54,926
Help me.

278
00:24:57,863 --> 00:25:01,500
Help me get back inside your novel.

279
00:25:03,869 --> 00:25:06,204
Because they need my help.

280
00:25:10,242 --> 00:25:11,710
They need me.

281
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:29,361
Oh, my goodness!

282
00:25:29,961 --> 00:25:31,496
Maria Clara Infantes.

283
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:34,299
You're acting crazy!

284
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:36,468
You're talking to Rizal's monument!

285
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:37,736
You've reached that point!

286
00:25:39,604 --> 00:25:40,605
How terrible!

287
00:25:42,307 --> 00:25:43,341
Oh my!

288
00:25:54,352 --> 00:25:56,655
I accept that there's nothing I can do.

289
00:25:58,490 --> 00:25:59,591
That's it.

290
00:26:00,158 --> 00:26:00,992
Bye, Rizal, Oh…

291
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:31,616
<i>Maybe in another time.</i>

292
00:27:33,585 --> 00:27:34,586
<i>In another world?</i>

293
00:27:35,587 --> 00:27:36,855
<i>In another universe?</i>

294
00:27:39,124 --> 00:27:42,160
When our worlds are already healed…

295
00:27:45,563 --> 00:27:46,831
Then, maybe…

296
00:27:48,633 --> 00:27:51,269
Maybe we're endgame.

297
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:00,111
Goodbye, Fidel.

298
00:28:07,986 --> 00:28:10,321
It's been thirteen years.

299
00:28:13,291 --> 00:28:14,993
Where are you now, miss?

300
00:28:18,563 --> 00:28:20,331
Will you still come back for me?

301
00:28:22,767 --> 00:28:24,569
Or have you completely forgotten about me?

302
00:28:32,477 --> 00:28:33,645
Hands up!

303
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:34,846
Who are you?

304
00:28:34,913 --> 00:28:36,548
Don't make any wrong moves!

305
00:28:36,614 --> 00:28:37,716
Show me your cedula!

306
00:28:45,423 --> 00:28:46,624
Search him.

307
00:29:08,012 --> 00:29:09,214
Not my friend!

308
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:35,173
I was gone for a while, my friend.

309
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:37,408
Yet you caused trouble again.

310
00:29:45,583 --> 00:29:47,152
There's a woman's corpse here!

311
00:30:25,723 --> 00:30:26,791
But that's good.

312
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:29,060
We'll have more weapons.

313
00:30:40,538 --> 00:30:41,739
No, don't.

314
00:30:41,806 --> 00:30:43,074
No.

315
00:30:43,141 --> 00:30:45,410
-I beg you.
-Please, no!

316
00:30:45,476 --> 00:30:46,711
Have mercy!

317
00:30:48,813 --> 00:30:54,519
Did you show any mercy to all the people
of the Philippines that you've oppressed?

318
00:30:54,586 --> 00:30:56,521
The lives you ruined?

319
00:30:56,588 --> 00:30:57,755
And the people you killed?

320
00:30:57,822 --> 00:30:59,757
Have mercy! Please, I'm begging!

321
00:30:59,824 --> 00:31:02,293
Death to all oppressors.

322
00:31:03,228 --> 00:31:05,597
Run for your lives now.

323
00:31:05,663 --> 00:31:07,131
No!

324
00:31:30,655 --> 00:31:31,656
So hot!

325
00:31:42,133 --> 00:31:43,635
Am I back?

326
00:31:46,137 --> 00:31:47,939
Am I finally in <i>El Fili</i>?

327
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:00,685
I think I am.

328
00:32:01,319 --> 00:32:02,620
Oh, wait…

329
00:32:06,124 --> 00:32:07,125
There.

330
00:32:09,527 --> 00:32:10,929
There you go!

331
00:32:10,995 --> 00:32:12,363
So that there's proof.

332
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:18,303
That's nice…

333
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:40,258
Miss…

334
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:45,330
Why aren't you moving?

335
00:32:55,106 --> 00:32:56,341
What's happening?

336
00:32:58,209 --> 00:32:59,410
What's happening this time?

337
00:33:02,914 --> 00:33:04,182
Whatever!

338
00:33:04,248 --> 00:33:05,249
Goodbye!

339
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,968
Miss, I'm sorry.

340
00:33:24,035 --> 00:33:25,570
There's something I need from you.

341
00:33:31,943 --> 00:33:33,878
Oh, my goodness!
What happened to your clothes?

342
00:33:33,945 --> 00:33:36,114
Where are my clothes?

343
00:33:54,999 --> 00:33:57,001
Saint Claire Monastery?

344
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,742
According to the novel,
she's supposed to be here…

345
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:08,746
Maria Clara?

346
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:16,220
Is anybody home?

347
00:34:16,988 --> 00:34:18,423
Is anybody home?

348
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:08,739
<i>Our love is bound in prayers, my love</i>.

349
00:35:08,806 --> 00:35:10,041
<i>Promise me</i>

350
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:14,112
<i>that our love will always be with you</i>

351
00:35:14,178 --> 00:35:16,147
<i>as well as that rosary.</i>

352
00:35:16,214 --> 00:35:17,648
<i>I promise, my love.</i>

353
00:35:18,316 --> 00:35:19,283
<i>I promise.</i>

354
00:36:27,585 --> 00:36:28,986
Good morning!

355
00:36:29,053 --> 00:36:30,321
How can I help you?

356
00:36:30,388 --> 00:36:31,789
Good morning.

357
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:35,459
I'm here for…

358
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:38,095
Maria Clara De Los Santos y Alba.

359
00:36:38,796 --> 00:36:41,232
Please tell her it's Klay,
her namesake is here.

360
00:36:41,299 --> 00:36:43,000
She knows what that means.

361
00:36:43,067 --> 00:36:44,669
I'm sorry, Miss,

362
00:36:44,735 --> 00:36:48,506
aren't you aware
that whoever enters the monastery

363
00:36:49,106 --> 00:36:53,611
is not allowed to be visited
or talked to by her family or relatives?

364
00:36:56,414 --> 00:36:57,848
Sister…

365
00:36:57,915 --> 00:37:00,585
I need to talk to Maria Clara.

366
00:37:00,651 --> 00:37:02,887
I'm begging you. Even just for a bit.

367
00:37:02,954 --> 00:37:04,121
Please.

368
00:37:05,456 --> 00:37:07,625
Wow! I still have my Spanish from <i>Noli</i>.

369
00:37:07,692 --> 00:37:11,429
But we have rules
and regulations that we follow.

370
00:37:12,563 --> 00:37:14,498
Even those powerful.

371
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:19,170
Just like Cardinal Moreno,
who visited last month,

372
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:21,305
and wasn't able to face Maria.

373
00:37:22,707 --> 00:37:24,008
Just a moment.

374
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:25,276
Cardinal Moreno?

375
00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:27,745
Yes.

376
00:37:28,813 --> 00:37:31,349
The wealthy foreign jeweler.

377
00:37:35,286 --> 00:37:36,754
Forgive me.

378
00:37:36,821 --> 00:37:39,690
But I can't grant you
permission, Señor Simoun.

379
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:47,765
Whose permission do I need
for me to speak with the nun?

380
00:37:48,332 --> 00:37:52,169
-If the Captain General--
-For your information, señor,

381
00:37:52,803 --> 00:37:59,243
the Captain General has nothing to do
with any church or monastery.

382
00:38:04,048 --> 00:38:09,086
Then give me any names,
so that I can ask permission.

383
00:38:10,254 --> 00:38:14,592
The guardian of Sister Maria…

384
00:38:14,659 --> 00:38:17,528
is none other than Father Bernardo Salvi.

385
00:38:27,204 --> 00:38:28,706
I don't understand it, señor.

386
00:38:30,775 --> 00:38:32,176
That is not important.

387
00:38:48,359 --> 00:38:49,794
I assume that he was speaking

388
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:52,463
in the English language.

389
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:54,398
Which I didn't understand.

390
00:38:59,036 --> 00:39:00,071
It's him.

391
00:39:03,074 --> 00:39:05,142
Too bad I wasn't able to see him.

392
00:39:07,778 --> 00:39:11,549
You know the famous
yet arrogant Señor Simoun?

393
00:39:14,385 --> 00:39:15,753
Sister,

394
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:18,189
I came here for Maria Clara.

395
00:39:18,255 --> 00:39:19,890
Please. Even just for a minute.

396
00:39:19,957 --> 00:39:21,892
I need to talk to her.

397
00:39:21,959 --> 00:39:22,960
Klay,

398
00:39:23,561 --> 00:39:27,031
if there's something
you want to tell Maria

399
00:39:27,898 --> 00:39:31,102
you can tell me
and I will relay it to her.

400
00:39:32,336 --> 00:39:33,804
You don't understand.

401
00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:36,807
I must personally say this to her.

402
00:39:37,742 --> 00:39:39,076
Well then,

403
00:39:39,143 --> 00:39:41,145
this conversation ends here.

404
00:39:42,146 --> 00:39:43,214
Goodbye, Klay.

405
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:54,525
Martina!

406
00:39:55,092 --> 00:39:56,026
Yes?

407
00:39:56,093 --> 00:39:58,629
Escort the lady outside. Right now!

408
00:39:58,696 --> 00:39:59,864
Okay.

409
00:40:01,499 --> 00:40:02,800
Maria Clara!

410
00:40:02,867 --> 00:40:05,035
It's me, Klay! Your friend!

411
00:40:05,102 --> 00:40:06,804
I'm here! I'm back!

412
00:40:06,871 --> 00:40:08,272
I have a lot to tell you!

413
00:40:08,339 --> 00:40:10,174
You need to know everything!

414
00:40:10,674 --> 00:40:12,543
Maria Clara, do you hear me?

415
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:14,945
Hold on, slow down! We're on the stairs!

416
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:18,215
Maria Clara!

417
00:40:18,282 --> 00:40:19,250
Klay?

418
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:27,258
Adelina?

419
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:31,262
Adelina, please. Help me.

420
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:37,201
Adelina.

421
00:40:37,835 --> 00:40:38,869
Adelina, please.

422
00:40:38,936 --> 00:40:40,237
Help me.

423
00:40:44,608 --> 00:40:47,111
I need the key to the window.

424
00:40:49,914 --> 00:40:51,115
Hurry up!

425
00:40:53,484 --> 00:40:56,687
The key!

426
00:41:02,226 --> 00:41:03,461
Ouch. Wait!

427
00:41:03,527 --> 00:41:04,462
-Wait!
-Get out of here.

428
00:41:04,528 --> 00:41:05,863
Ouch! It hurts!

429
00:41:05,930 --> 00:41:07,031
Maria Clara!

430
00:41:07,097 --> 00:41:08,032
Ouch!

431
00:41:09,934 --> 00:41:10,901
Maria Clara!

432
00:41:14,905 --> 00:41:16,674
Maria Clara!

433
00:41:17,908 --> 00:41:19,777
My God, Maria Clara, come on!

434
00:41:20,411 --> 00:41:22,613
My voice is already hoarse!

435
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:24,682
If you can hear me, let me know!

436
00:41:24,748 --> 00:41:26,183
Come out of here!

437
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:27,718
Oh, my goodness.

438
00:41:27,785 --> 00:41:29,820
Don't make a scene here, Miss.

439
00:41:29,887 --> 00:41:31,155
Please.

440
00:41:32,089 --> 00:41:35,326
Maria Clara, don't lose hope!

441
00:41:36,193 --> 00:41:38,329
The one you've been waiting for!

442
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:42,266
Just like Jean Valjean
that you read in a novel!

443
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:46,036
And all the soap operas I've seen.

444
00:42:00,651 --> 00:42:02,353
I need to speak in English

445
00:42:02,419 --> 00:42:03,821
so others won't understand.

446
00:42:03,888 --> 00:42:05,155
So, please.

447
00:42:05,222 --> 00:42:08,559
Listen carefully
and try to find out what I'm saying.

448
00:42:18,802 --> 00:42:20,104
Maria Clara!

449
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:21,539
Martina.

450
00:42:21,605 --> 00:42:23,474
Banished her. Quick.

451
00:42:25,876 --> 00:42:26,944
Get out of here.

452
00:42:27,011 --> 00:42:28,646
-Ouch!
-Get out of here!

453
00:42:28,712 --> 00:42:29,980
Get out of here!

454
00:42:32,416 --> 00:42:33,817
Get back inside!

455
00:42:33,884 --> 00:42:35,586
You're not allowed here.

456
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:37,321
Get back now!

457
00:42:43,127 --> 00:42:44,061
-Ouch!
-Get out of here!

458
00:42:44,128 --> 00:42:45,262
-Ouch!
-And if not...

459
00:42:45,329 --> 00:42:47,464
-I will take you to prison now!
-Ouch!

460
00:42:47,531 --> 00:42:49,733
Fine, I'm going!

461
00:43:00,711 --> 00:43:02,079
<i>Auntie Isabel is not here.</i>

462
00:43:02,146 --> 00:43:03,747
She's at church.

463
00:43:05,282 --> 00:43:06,216
Who are you?

464
00:43:07,651 --> 00:43:08,986
I am a family friend.

465
00:43:10,554 --> 00:43:12,423
Is Captain Tiago here?

466
00:43:12,489 --> 00:43:15,859
He hasn't gone home
since the other day, señorita.

467
00:43:15,926 --> 00:43:19,296
He's probably at the public smoking den.

468
00:43:20,364 --> 00:43:24,635
<i>Especially now that Captain Tiago
smokes opium very often.</i>

469
00:43:30,374 --> 00:43:31,875
So, what I read was right.

470
00:43:33,777 --> 00:43:35,579
The captain became an addict.

471
00:43:36,246 --> 00:43:37,414
Addict?

472
00:43:38,048 --> 00:43:39,717
Señorita, what is that?

473
00:43:42,152 --> 00:43:43,387
Nevermind.

474
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:44,888
I'll just look for him.

475
00:43:47,591 --> 00:43:49,059
Oh…

476
00:43:49,126 --> 00:43:51,795
Do you know Señor Simoun?

477
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:54,031
Or Fidel?

478
00:43:55,399 --> 00:43:56,567
I wonder how he is…

479
00:43:57,234 --> 00:43:58,102
How are they?

480
00:43:59,870 --> 00:44:01,372
Do they visit here?

481
00:44:01,872 --> 00:44:04,575
In <i>El Fili,</i> thirteen years
have passed since the events in <i>Noli</i>.

482
00:44:05,209 --> 00:44:08,212
I don't understand
what you are saying, Miss.

483
00:44:08,278 --> 00:44:10,714
And I don't have any idea
who are those people.

484
00:44:11,715 --> 00:44:14,685
I've been serving here
for more than a year.

485
00:44:14,752 --> 00:44:18,155
But no one has ever come here to visit.

486
00:44:18,222 --> 00:44:19,723
You're the first one.

487
00:44:25,863 --> 00:44:27,564
It wasn't like this before.

488
00:44:28,999 --> 00:44:30,701
Back then, they had a lot of friends.

489
00:44:31,535 --> 00:44:32,903
Hosting a lot of parties.

490
00:44:38,742 --> 00:44:40,177
It's so sad.

491
00:44:43,547 --> 00:44:45,215
Okay, thank you. I'll go ahead.

492
00:44:45,282 --> 00:44:46,550
Bye.

493
00:45:09,506 --> 00:45:11,542
Forgive me, Sister Teresa…

494
00:45:13,410 --> 00:45:16,246
but I just want to ask you something.

495
00:45:18,315 --> 00:45:20,818
Was there anyone looking for me earlier?

496
00:45:22,286 --> 00:45:25,956
And you stopped praying just for that?

497
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:29,593
It's just yes or no, Sister Teresa.

498
00:45:31,328 --> 00:45:32,563
Because…

499
00:45:32,629 --> 00:45:34,398
I'm not sure if it was my imagination

500
00:45:34,465 --> 00:45:37,201
or if what I heard earlier was real.

501
00:45:37,267 --> 00:45:40,304
I couldn't ask Adelina
about it because she's deaf.

502
00:45:41,305 --> 00:45:43,173
So, I want to know.

503
00:45:44,441 --> 00:45:46,710
If someone's looking for me earlier.

504
00:45:49,613 --> 00:45:52,149
And who would possibly be looking for you,

505
00:45:52,216 --> 00:45:53,450
Maria?

506
00:46:33,557 --> 00:46:35,359
Good morning, Captain Tiago.

507
00:46:36,827 --> 00:46:38,162
It is indeed

508
00:46:38,228 --> 00:46:40,030
a good morning!

509
00:46:41,899 --> 00:46:43,367
There are so many flowers.

510
00:46:47,704 --> 00:46:48,939
Captain Tiago.

511
00:46:50,641 --> 00:46:52,009
Take a good look at me.

512
00:46:54,678 --> 00:46:56,113
It's me, Klay.

513
00:46:57,915 --> 00:46:59,683
I used to live in your house.

514
00:47:01,685 --> 00:47:03,887
Maria Clara became my friend.

515
00:47:07,457 --> 00:47:09,927
She's my namesake.

516
00:47:10,494 --> 00:47:11,662
You can call her Klay.

517
00:47:16,967 --> 00:47:18,235
Everything has changed…

518
00:47:20,704 --> 00:47:22,539
How come,

519
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:25,209
you still look young?

520
00:47:27,911 --> 00:47:30,647
Thank God, you still remember me.

521
00:47:32,749 --> 00:47:35,953
For me, it was just like yesterday, when--

522
00:47:37,788 --> 00:47:40,791
But for all of you here,
it's been thirteen years, right?

523
00:47:44,494 --> 00:47:45,929
Captain Tiago…

524
00:47:46,597 --> 00:47:49,132
I need to speak with Maria Clara.

525
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:53,203
It's hard to explain, but…

526
00:47:54,838 --> 00:47:57,341
I have read that she's going to die.

527
00:47:59,509 --> 00:48:01,712
And Father Salvi will make everyone think

528
00:48:01,778 --> 00:48:03,280
that she died because of an illness.

529
00:48:03,347 --> 00:48:04,715
But that's not true.

530
00:48:06,483 --> 00:48:13,023
Because I think that bald friar
abused and assaulted her in that convent.

531
00:48:16,126 --> 00:48:18,862
Maria Clara can't die, Don Tiago.

532
00:48:20,631 --> 00:48:22,432
That's why I need to talk to her.

533
00:48:23,867 --> 00:48:27,337
There's a lot of things I need
to confess to her. Please, help me.

534
00:48:28,338 --> 00:48:30,107
Let's save your daughter.

535
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:38,248
Go on, Maria.

536
00:48:38,815 --> 00:48:40,050
Start praying again.

537
00:48:48,025 --> 00:48:49,159
Let's go, Father.

538
00:48:57,367 --> 00:49:00,237
A woman came looking
for Maria earlier, Father.

539
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:03,640
And she's very persistent.

540
00:49:05,742 --> 00:49:08,011
Just like the Captain General's friend…

541
00:49:09,179 --> 00:49:10,747
Señor Simoun,

542
00:49:10,814 --> 00:49:12,950
who visited here last month.

543
00:49:13,016 --> 00:49:14,918
What a surprise.

544
00:49:16,253 --> 00:49:19,022
And what did that woman want?

545
00:49:20,157 --> 00:49:21,658
They didn't say anything.

546
00:49:22,759 --> 00:49:24,394
Of course, Father…

547
00:49:25,262 --> 00:49:28,065
I didn't allow them to see the nun.

548
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:31,268
Very good.

549
00:49:32,436 --> 00:49:33,804
Anyway…

550
00:49:35,672 --> 00:49:39,509
who was that woman?

551
00:49:40,744 --> 00:49:42,813
Did she introduce herself?

552
00:49:44,514 --> 00:49:45,882
Please tell her that it's Klay.

553
00:49:45,949 --> 00:49:48,118
Her namesake is here,
she already knows what it means.

554
00:49:48,685 --> 00:49:49,720
Her name is…

555
00:49:50,687 --> 00:49:51,521
Klay?

556
00:49:53,423 --> 00:49:55,125
Are you sure, Sister?

557
00:49:55,759 --> 00:49:56,827
Yes, Father.

558
00:49:57,394 --> 00:49:59,363
And just like Señor Simoun,

559
00:49:59,429 --> 00:50:02,699
this woman can also speak English.

560
00:50:04,568 --> 00:50:08,638
I knew a Klay before in San Diego,

561
00:50:09,639 --> 00:50:12,576
who was also fluent in English.

562
00:50:12,642 --> 00:50:15,278
But, for the past thirteen years,

563
00:50:15,345 --> 00:50:20,751
that woman disappeared
and was never found again in that town.

564
00:50:22,986 --> 00:50:24,221
Did she return?

565
00:50:25,489 --> 00:50:28,358
And she came here?

566
00:50:29,559 --> 00:50:32,162
We need to save Maria Clara.

567
00:50:34,664 --> 00:50:35,899
Because if we don't,

568
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:40,971
Crisostomo will be even
more consumed by anger and darkness.

569
00:50:49,546 --> 00:50:52,816
What the hell
are you talking about, stupid woman?

570
00:50:55,185 --> 00:50:57,487
Crisostomo's gone!

571
00:51:08,165 --> 00:51:11,401
Even Maria Clara.

572
00:51:14,271 --> 00:51:18,308
No, your daughter
is just in the monastery.

573
00:51:21,578 --> 00:51:22,646
My daughter?

574
00:51:25,415 --> 00:51:26,950
The real daughter…

575
00:51:27,784 --> 00:51:29,119
of the devil!

576
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:34,524
Who pretends to be God's messenger.

577
00:51:36,626 --> 00:51:37,961
He's the reason

578
00:51:38,962 --> 00:51:43,533
my wife died at a young age!

579
00:51:45,735 --> 00:51:52,609
He destroyed my family,
my life, and my reputation!

580
00:51:54,845 --> 00:51:58,815
But Captain Tiago, didn't you treat
Maria Clara as your child?

581
00:51:58,882 --> 00:52:01,151
You wholeheartedly loved her, right?

582
00:52:01,218 --> 00:52:02,953
I have no child!

583
00:52:03,019 --> 00:52:05,021
My daughter's gone.

584
00:52:05,088 --> 00:52:06,323
She's gone!

585
00:52:06,389 --> 00:52:07,557
Gone!

586
00:52:07,624 --> 00:52:09,826
She's gone!

587
00:52:14,965 --> 00:52:16,433
My daughter's gone!

588
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:18,001
She's gone!

589
00:52:19,336 --> 00:52:20,704
She's gone…

590
00:52:38,054 --> 00:52:39,689
It might be her.

591
00:52:41,291 --> 00:52:43,894
It might be the Klay you're referring to.

592
00:52:45,128 --> 00:52:46,363
But Father,

593
00:52:47,130 --> 00:52:50,734
you said that it's been thirteen years.

594
00:52:51,501 --> 00:52:57,440
Do you mean this woman
was still a young child

595
00:52:57,507 --> 00:52:59,276
when you last saw her?

596
00:52:59,342 --> 00:53:01,244
Don't be stupid, Sister.

597
00:53:02,679 --> 00:53:06,016
Maria and Klay are almost the same age.

598
00:53:07,317 --> 00:53:11,321
I think Klay is about
thirty-three years old now.

599
00:53:11,955 --> 00:53:13,490
But Father…

600
00:53:13,557 --> 00:53:15,058
this woman is,

601
00:53:15,859 --> 00:53:21,264
looks only nineteen or twenty years old.

602
00:53:25,035 --> 00:53:27,437
What? That young?

603
00:53:27,504 --> 00:53:28,939
Yes, Father.

604
00:53:30,173 --> 00:53:32,042
My vision is still clear.

605
00:53:32,108 --> 00:53:34,945
All right, no matter who she is,

606
00:53:35,011 --> 00:53:38,348
do not let her see Maria

607
00:53:39,649 --> 00:53:43,887
because I don't want the nun's mind

608
00:53:45,021 --> 00:53:47,090
to be brainwashed.

609
00:53:47,591 --> 00:53:48,758
Understood?

610
00:53:48,825 --> 00:53:50,227
Yes, Father.

611
00:53:50,293 --> 00:53:51,528
All right.

612
00:53:51,595 --> 00:53:55,966
After Maria finishes her prayers
send her to the reception room,

613
00:53:56,766 --> 00:53:58,368
so we can talk.

614
00:53:59,002 --> 00:54:00,370
Yes, Father.

615
00:54:01,238 --> 00:54:02,539
Right away, Father.

616
00:54:09,512 --> 00:54:10,480
Klay?

617
00:54:11,715 --> 00:54:13,383
Where are you now?

618
00:54:14,484 --> 00:54:17,954
Why did you suddenly disappear?

619
00:54:20,223 --> 00:54:22,125
And now you're back?

620
00:55:07,337 --> 00:55:11,107
QUIROGA'S COMMERCIAL ENTERPRISE

621
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:25,555
Who's the one…

622
00:55:25,622 --> 00:55:30,093
been called by the friars The Devil?

623
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:31,161
My comrade.

624
00:55:31,761 --> 00:55:35,365
Which better be called The Judge.

625
00:55:35,432 --> 00:55:37,100
And you, gentleman, who are you?

626
00:55:42,305 --> 00:55:44,040
Where do all these weapons come from?

627
00:55:45,775 --> 00:55:47,210
And how much is all of it?

628
00:55:49,245 --> 00:55:50,847
I will not accept any payment.

629
00:55:51,948 --> 00:55:55,051
I will give all of these to you.

630
00:55:55,785 --> 00:55:57,087
What a joke!

631
00:55:58,321 --> 00:56:00,156
I used to be a merchant.

632
00:56:00,223 --> 00:56:04,761
So I know that you just don't
give away those kinds of products.

633
00:56:05,595 --> 00:56:07,430
Especially without anything in return.

634
00:56:07,497 --> 00:56:11,267
Did the government send you
to entrap me and my comrade here?

635
00:56:11,334 --> 00:56:13,069
No, gentlemen.

636
00:56:13,636 --> 00:56:15,138
I am helping you.

637
00:56:16,773 --> 00:56:20,043
I'm just following orders from someone

638
00:56:20,110 --> 00:56:23,480
who wants your revolution to succeed.

639
00:56:23,546 --> 00:56:25,682
He bought these weapons from me

640
00:56:26,216 --> 00:56:28,218
and I will give these to you.

641
00:56:28,284 --> 00:56:29,986
And who is he,

642
00:56:30,487 --> 00:56:33,089
whom you say supports our cause?

643
00:56:33,156 --> 00:56:36,393
I cannot tell you who he is, señor.

644
00:56:37,193 --> 00:56:39,195
I assure you that we're not your enemies,

645
00:56:39,863 --> 00:56:41,364
but we're your friends.

646
00:56:42,031 --> 00:56:44,134
He still has more weapons to give you.

647
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:45,869
I will take care of it.

648
00:56:48,104 --> 00:56:50,106
He said they aren't our enemies.

649
00:56:50,173 --> 00:56:52,308
He said they're our friends.

650
00:56:52,876 --> 00:56:56,880
And they will give us more weapons.

651
00:57:01,951 --> 00:57:02,919
That's good.

652
00:57:04,754 --> 00:57:07,891
That is a huge help, Mister Quiroga.

653
00:57:08,792 --> 00:57:11,661
Thank you very much
to you and your friend.

654
00:57:16,166 --> 00:57:18,635
Whoever that person is,
who refuses to be known,

655
00:57:19,402 --> 00:57:22,739
please tell him
that we hope he has no other interest

656
00:57:22,806 --> 00:57:26,242
apart from helping the people's revolt.

657
00:57:26,309 --> 00:57:31,948
And please tell him
that message is from The Judge and me.

658
00:57:32,015 --> 00:57:33,883
The Enlightened.

659
00:57:33,950 --> 00:57:37,120
From The Judge and The Enlightened.

660
00:57:37,187 --> 00:57:38,755
Okay, then.

661
00:57:40,023 --> 00:57:41,024
Thank you.

662
00:57:44,260 --> 00:57:45,161
Thank you.

663
00:57:49,833 --> 00:57:51,301
Let's hide these.

664
00:58:42,218 --> 00:58:44,153
I do miss him.

665
00:58:47,156 --> 00:58:48,791
Oh, come on!

666
00:58:48,858 --> 00:58:52,295
Everything reminds me of Fidel.

667
00:58:55,732 --> 00:58:56,633
Come on, Klay!

668
00:58:56,699 --> 00:58:58,668
Just eat first. You're just hungry.

669
00:59:00,136 --> 00:59:01,538
Then miss him later.

670
01:00:24,454 --> 01:00:27,223
<i>I banished the lady
who was looking for you earlier.</i>

671
01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:29,158
<i>And what was her name?</i>

672
01:00:29,225 --> 01:00:30,927
<i>Miss Klay.</i>

673
01:00:30,994 --> 01:00:32,261
<i>Maria.</i>

674
01:00:32,328 --> 01:00:33,896
<i>If you'll just peek outside the window.</i>

675
01:00:33,963 --> 01:00:35,865
<i>then it would bring me so much happiness</i>

676
01:00:37,533 --> 01:00:38,835
to see you again.

677
01:00:38,901 --> 01:00:43,940
Those natives are slowing down our trip.

678
01:00:44,007 --> 01:00:47,276
Most especially the Philippines' progress.

679
01:00:47,343 --> 01:00:50,613
It's not the natives.
The river is our problem.

680
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:55,652
The solution to that problem is simple.

681
01:00:55,718 --> 01:01:01,424
Logic is necessary to solve that problem.

682
01:01:01,491 --> 01:01:02,759
Finally!

683
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:06,429
I'm glad to meet you.

684
01:01:11,034 --> 01:01:11,901
Not dead.

685
01:01:13,236 --> 01:01:14,804
The man is back?

686
01:01:14,871 --> 01:01:16,973
COMING UP

687
01:01:22,679 --> 01:01:25,982
