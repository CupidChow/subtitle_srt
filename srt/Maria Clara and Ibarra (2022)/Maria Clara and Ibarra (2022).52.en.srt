00:00:30,764 --> 00:00:34,234
MARIA CLARA AND IBARRA

2
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:38,071
THIS PROGRAM, WHICH IS ADAPTED
FROM THE NOVELS OF DR. JOSE P. RIZAL,

3
00:00:38,138 --> 00:00:41,975
IS PRESENTED USING DRAMATIC ELEMENTS
TO CONNECT THE PRESENT AND THE PAST

4
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:46,379
IN A SPECIAL REIMAGINING OF THE NATIONAL
LITERATURE FILIPINOS ARE PROUD OF.

5
00:00:46,446 --> 00:00:47,714
<i>I already warned you.</i>

6
00:00:47,781 --> 00:00:49,716
<i>Don't meddle.</i>

7
00:00:49,783 --> 00:00:51,051
<i>Even if I don't meddle,</i>

8
00:00:51,117 --> 00:00:53,053
<i>your Spanish friends will still find out</i>

9
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:54,521
<i>you're their enemy.</i>

10
00:00:54,587 --> 00:00:56,556
<i>They will find out your plans.</i>

11
00:00:56,623 --> 00:00:58,625
That's what's written in the book.

12
00:00:58,691 --> 00:01:00,894
Enough with that book!

13
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,862
You can't go inside!

14
00:01:02,929 --> 00:01:05,532
<i>The moment the lamp has been lit inside,</i>

15
00:01:05,598 --> 00:01:07,901
<i>the lamp will explode.</i>

16
00:01:07,967 --> 00:01:10,570
So Isagani, if you still value your life,

17
00:01:10,637 --> 00:01:12,238
-get out of here now!
-Let go of me!

18
00:01:12,305 --> 00:01:14,074
Isagani!

19
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:15,241
The lamp is going to explode!

20
00:01:15,308 --> 00:01:18,078
The Brown Cardinal
will blow up this celebration!

21
00:01:18,144 --> 00:01:19,412
<i>Hurry! Get out!</i>

22
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:20,914
Everyone, stop!

23
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:22,749
Your days are numbered!

24
00:01:22,816 --> 00:01:24,084
That's enough, señor!

25
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:27,420
Señor Crisostomo, that's enough!

26
00:01:27,487 --> 00:01:28,588
<i>If we don't go in now,</i>

27
00:01:28,655 --> 00:01:30,390
our friends might die.

28
00:01:30,457 --> 00:01:32,959
Our force is not enough to beat them.

29
00:01:33,026 --> 00:01:33,893
We'll join you!

30
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,028
Cabeza Tales!

31
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:36,663
<i>-We're coming with you too!
-Brother!</i>

32
00:01:36,729 --> 00:01:38,231
<i>Well then, let's go.</i>

33
00:01:38,298 --> 00:01:39,732
Look at all of us, señor.

34
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:42,268
Many innocent people will be involved.

35
00:01:42,335 --> 00:01:43,770
<i>There's no escaping for me now.</i>

36
00:01:43,837 --> 00:01:45,438
Arrest that traitor!

37
00:01:45,505 --> 00:01:47,807
<i>Arrest all the bandits!</i>

38
00:01:48,475 --> 00:01:50,410
<i>Set them free. Don't move!</i>

39
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:54,247
<i>Drop your weapons.</i>

40
00:01:54,314 --> 00:01:55,415
Set the innocent free.

41
00:01:55,482 --> 00:01:56,583
Let's go!

42
00:01:56,649 --> 00:01:58,585
-Let's go, everyone!
-Hurry!

43
00:02:12,832 --> 00:02:13,833
Sir!

44
00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:15,435
You drink it.

45
00:02:15,502 --> 00:02:17,003
<i>Why did you do that?</i>

46
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:18,771
<i>I will leave this world</i>

47
00:02:18,838 --> 00:02:20,440
as Crisostomo.

48
00:02:20,507 --> 00:02:21,441
<i>Finally.</i>

49
00:02:21,508 --> 00:02:23,376
<i>You're back, my friend.</i>

50
00:02:23,443 --> 00:02:24,844
<i>Even if it is painful</i>

51
00:02:24,911 --> 00:02:26,279
<i>for you to leave us again.</i>

52
00:02:26,346 --> 00:02:27,447
My friend.

53
00:02:28,014 --> 00:02:29,816
PREVIOUSLY

54
00:02:55,108 --> 00:02:56,009
What?

55
00:02:57,544 --> 00:02:58,611
Let's go?

56
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:05,218
Perhaps in a perfect world,

57
00:03:07,387 --> 00:03:08,688
it's easy to give in,

58
00:03:09,789 --> 00:03:11,491
to what my heart is saying.

59
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:18,631
But…

60
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,269
I can't come with you
right now, Ms. Klay.

61
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:29,742
I still can't leave this world

62
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:32,879
until we haven't fought

63
00:03:34,581 --> 00:03:36,316
for this country's freedom

64
00:03:38,685 --> 00:03:40,753
that's being conquered by foreigners.

65
00:03:47,694 --> 00:03:49,128
Forgive me, Ms. Klay.

66
00:03:51,965 --> 00:03:54,133
But I cannot leave

67
00:03:55,368 --> 00:03:56,669
my wounded homeland.

68
00:04:06,112 --> 00:04:07,614
Now I know

69
00:04:08,548 --> 00:04:11,217
why the name Fidel is not written

70
00:04:11,284 --> 00:04:13,286
in the first version of the novel.

71
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:19,325
Perhaps because

72
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:22,095
it's written in your heart?

73
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:26,566
Oh, aside from that!

74
00:04:31,738 --> 00:04:34,440
For the longest time that I've been here,

75
00:04:35,408 --> 00:04:36,843
I've learned…

76
00:04:38,578 --> 00:04:40,046
there are a lot of heroes

77
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:42,849
whose names are not written in history.

78
00:04:45,985 --> 00:04:47,754
You're probably one of them.

79
00:04:50,823 --> 00:04:53,760
But even though
your names aren't written,

80
00:04:55,862 --> 00:04:57,630
you were not silenced.

81
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:01,234
You stood firm

82
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,437
and you kept on fighting.

83
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:07,707
And we will keep on fighting, Ms. Klay.

84
00:05:09,676 --> 00:05:12,211
This country will be free.

85
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:18,518
I will do everything to win back

86
00:05:18,584 --> 00:05:20,219
the story of our country.

87
00:05:32,365 --> 00:05:34,400
And once we have it back…

88
00:05:37,036 --> 00:05:38,338
I will find you.

89
00:06:32,325 --> 00:06:33,426
Who is…

90
00:06:34,327 --> 00:06:35,995
Who is that man, Ms. Klay?

91
00:06:37,764 --> 00:06:39,165
That's Mr. To--

92
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,068
You can see him?

93
00:06:45,471 --> 00:06:46,439
So he is…

94
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:50,643
the Mr. Torres you've been talking about.

95
00:06:54,313 --> 00:06:55,681
How come…

96
00:06:56,649 --> 00:06:57,884
I could see him now

97
00:06:58,484 --> 00:07:00,953
but before, I couldn't.

98
00:07:02,488 --> 00:07:05,691
There's a time and reason for everything,

99
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:08,895
Don Fidel delos Reyes y Maglipol.

100
00:07:10,163 --> 00:07:11,330
Let's go.

101
00:07:12,064 --> 00:07:14,267
Ms. Maria Clara Infantes.

102
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:28,448
Tell them my goodbyes, okay?

103
00:07:33,085 --> 00:07:34,487
Bye, Fidel.

104
00:07:55,608 --> 00:07:56,809
I love…

105
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:01,414
you very much.

106
00:08:08,187 --> 00:08:10,056
I love you too very much…

107
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:12,658
My Ms. Klay.

108
00:09:48,988 --> 00:09:51,624
<i>Perhaps underwater,</i>

109
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:55,695
<i>this treasure will no longer cause evil.</i>

110
00:09:57,363 --> 00:09:59,665
<i>It can't bend what is straight.</i>

111
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:03,936
<i>It can't hear the call of greed.</i>

112
00:10:05,037 --> 00:10:08,140
<i>God will decide how you will rise again</i>

113
00:10:08,207 --> 00:10:10,376
<i>from the depths of the sea</i>

114
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:16,983
<i>if you are needed
for a godly and great purpose.</i>

115
00:10:28,194 --> 00:10:30,396
Miss, are you okay?

116
00:10:38,337 --> 00:10:39,872
What happened to you?

117
00:11:07,933 --> 00:11:10,336
My friends are gone.

118
00:11:16,876 --> 00:11:18,277
They're gone.

119
00:11:21,614 --> 00:11:23,249
I'm back.

120
00:11:27,153 --> 00:11:29,622
Did something bad happen to your friends?

121
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,891
Do you want to report it to the police?

122
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,369
They cannot do anything.

123
00:11:45,137 --> 00:11:46,706
All right. Thank you.

124
00:11:46,772 --> 00:11:48,107
Thank you.

125
00:12:22,174 --> 00:12:23,676
I'm back.

126
00:12:30,216 --> 00:12:32,118
The story has ended.

127
00:13:34,413 --> 00:13:35,314
Mom?

128
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:40,119
Mom!

129
00:13:42,888 --> 00:13:43,923
Narsing!

130
00:13:45,191 --> 00:13:46,859
Narsing, don't do this.

131
00:13:47,593 --> 00:13:49,695
Who will take care of your kids?

132
00:13:49,762 --> 00:13:50,663
Of our son?

133
00:13:52,898 --> 00:13:55,067
Narsing, no other man would love you if--

134
00:13:55,134 --> 00:13:59,772
I don't care if I won't find
another man who would love me!

135
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,676
My children's love is enough for me!

136
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:06,212
I don't want this anymore.

137
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:09,081
I can't bear to be with you anymore!

138
00:14:10,115 --> 00:14:15,054
Narsing, if you leave,
you won't have a place to stay.

139
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,488
You will lose your husband.

140
00:14:17,089 --> 00:14:19,491
You will lose a companion in life.

141
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:21,193
If you leave, Narsing,

142
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,495
-you're at the losing end.
-Yes!

143
00:14:24,396 --> 00:14:25,764
It's my loss, right?

144
00:14:26,765 --> 00:14:28,534
It's my loss if I leave.

145
00:14:29,134 --> 00:14:31,871
That's why I packed your things.

146
00:14:31,937 --> 00:14:33,072
Leave.

147
00:14:33,138 --> 00:14:34,540
Leave!

148
00:14:35,507 --> 00:14:36,909
Good thing Elias isn't here

149
00:14:36,976 --> 00:14:39,078
to witness how I banished you.

150
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:41,247
Klay.

151
00:14:42,314 --> 00:14:43,782
Talk to your mother.

152
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:45,784
Where would I go?

153
00:14:46,352 --> 00:14:47,686
That's not our problem, is it?

154
00:14:52,424 --> 00:14:53,559
Leave now!

155
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:55,928
You like that, huh?

156
00:14:56,495 --> 00:14:58,264
Go ahead. Dare to hurt my daughter!

157
00:14:58,964 --> 00:15:00,466
Go, hurt her!

158
00:15:02,368 --> 00:15:06,672
You were never a good father
and husband in this household!

159
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:07,940
So leave!

160
00:15:08,807 --> 00:15:10,542
I will call the authorities on you.

161
00:15:10,609 --> 00:15:13,412
I'll even call the police if I have to!

162
00:15:13,979 --> 00:15:15,180
Get out!

163
00:15:16,682 --> 00:15:19,351
Get out!

164
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:20,552
Get out of here!

165
00:15:20,619 --> 00:15:23,055
-Narsing, forgive me.
-Go. Now!

166
00:15:23,122 --> 00:15:24,023
Just go now!

167
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:25,057
Go!

168
00:15:25,124 --> 00:15:26,358
Get out of here now!

169
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:27,393
Get out!

170
00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:29,094
Leave!

171
00:16:00,426 --> 00:16:01,627
Breathe.

172
00:16:01,694 --> 00:16:02,962
I'm here now, Mom.

173
00:16:03,028 --> 00:16:04,563
I'm right here.

174
00:16:15,607 --> 00:16:17,042
Klay.

175
00:16:18,677 --> 00:16:20,245
I'm sorry.

176
00:16:22,514 --> 00:16:26,919
It took me this long
to finally end our suffering

177
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:29,388
at Ronald's hands.

178
00:16:32,124 --> 00:16:33,592
But

179
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:35,227
I promise…

180
00:16:36,962 --> 00:16:41,867
I will never let anyone
hurt you or your brother.

181
00:16:41,934 --> 00:16:43,769
Neither you nor Elias.

182
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:45,571
Never.

183
00:16:45,637 --> 00:16:48,173
No matter how scared I am.

184
00:17:01,553 --> 00:17:02,855
Breathe, Mom.

185
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:15,401
I'm proud that you're my mother.

186
00:17:18,137 --> 00:17:20,439
And that fear that you're feeling?

187
00:17:23,776 --> 00:17:25,677
That's nothing compared

188
00:17:26,412 --> 00:17:28,280
to our love for each other.

189
00:17:30,082 --> 00:17:33,986
And to the hopes, we cling
that one day our lives will be better.

190
00:17:37,322 --> 00:17:38,991
You're a woman, Mom.

191
00:17:40,159 --> 00:17:41,493
We are women.

192
00:17:43,829 --> 00:17:45,064
We are humans.

193
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:48,500
We're strong.

194
00:17:49,868 --> 00:17:51,437
You are strong.

195
00:18:00,813 --> 00:18:02,081
Wait a minute.

196
00:18:03,348 --> 00:18:05,551
Why do you suddenly know so much?

197
00:18:06,118 --> 00:18:07,753
You have a lot of…

198
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:09,354
quotable quotes!

199
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:15,694
But it's effective, right?

200
00:18:18,163 --> 00:18:19,865
I learned it from…

201
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:24,636
the book that I read.

202
00:18:33,045 --> 00:18:34,046
High five!

203
00:19:47,452 --> 00:19:50,856
For the longest time that I've been here,

204
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:52,824
I've learned…

205
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:55,794
there are a lot of heroes

206
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:58,096
whose names are not written in history.

207
00:19:59,164 --> 00:20:01,300
<i>You're probably one of them.</i>

208
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:41,740
<i>When Mr. Torres made me
read</i> Noli Me Tangere,

209
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:44,042
I said…

210
00:20:44,109 --> 00:20:45,477
"What for?"

211
00:20:47,212 --> 00:20:50,916
I can't grasp how reading <i>Noli Me Tangere</i>

212
00:20:50,983 --> 00:20:52,951
will help me
become skillful in dressing wounds

213
00:20:53,018 --> 00:20:56,421
and attaching IVs to a patient like a pro.

214
00:20:56,488 --> 00:20:58,624
That's why this country remains stagnant

215
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:00,626
because of Filipinos like you
who don't care about

216
00:21:00,692 --> 00:21:03,128
the true events in our history!

217
00:21:05,163 --> 00:21:06,732
That's how we are.

218
00:21:07,733 --> 00:21:09,234
We just don't care.

219
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:12,838
It's either we decided to just forget,

220
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:16,341
or we have a distorted knowledge about it,

221
00:21:16,408 --> 00:21:19,044
or we just simply don't value our history.

222
00:21:22,347 --> 00:21:25,183
To be honest. I didn't
understand it at first either. Right?

223
00:21:26,084 --> 00:21:27,119
But…

224
00:21:27,686 --> 00:21:28,687
it turns out…

225
00:21:30,689 --> 00:21:34,793
that before you question
the importance of learning our history…

226
00:21:36,528 --> 00:21:38,196
it's important to read about it first.

227
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:40,432
Research

228
00:21:40,932 --> 00:21:42,301
before criticizing.

229
00:21:43,335 --> 00:21:45,037
That's why when I entered--

230
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:52,611
When I read Rizal's novels…

231
00:21:55,714 --> 00:21:57,015
to be honest

232
00:21:58,083 --> 00:22:00,986
it's not just
our history that I've learned.

233
00:22:02,688 --> 00:22:06,525
<i>I learned the true meaning…</i>

234
00:22:10,295 --> 00:22:11,196
<i>of love…</i>

235
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:16,902
<i>sacrifice…</i>

236
00:22:17,736 --> 00:22:21,039
<i>and caring without asking
for anything in return.</i>

237
00:22:22,908 --> 00:22:25,410
<i>May it be a woman or a man…</i>

238
00:22:26,211 --> 00:22:27,979
<i>old or young…</i>

239
00:22:28,914 --> 00:22:31,483
<i>educated or even not…</i>

240
00:22:32,584 --> 00:22:34,219
<i>wealthy or poor,</i>

241
00:22:35,253 --> 00:22:39,191
<i>each one of us should be equal.</i>

242
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:45,297
<i>We must possess
a strong mind and heart to fight</i>

243
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:48,066
<i>for our welfare and our lives.</i>

244
00:23:20,766 --> 00:23:23,335
So it is not right to forget…

245
00:23:27,005 --> 00:23:29,608
to not care about our history…

246
00:23:32,778 --> 00:23:35,881
and especially to distort our past.

247
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,188
You can revise it.

248
00:23:44,723 --> 00:23:46,258
But…

249
00:23:46,324 --> 00:23:48,727
it must be based only on truth.

250
00:23:50,962 --> 00:23:55,033
<i>Based on your aspiration
to correct what's wrong</i>

251
00:23:55,600 --> 00:24:00,372
<i>to ensure that
you can deliver what's true and just.</i>

252
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:01,373
<i>Keep on fighting.</i>

253
00:24:03,074 --> 00:24:04,342
<i>Even if you're a woman,</i>

254
00:24:05,043 --> 00:24:06,211
<i>keep on fighting.</i>

255
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:09,481
<i>Because even though we're not gods,</i>

256
00:24:10,749 --> 00:24:12,384
<i>we're just mere characters,</i>

257
00:24:14,085 --> 00:24:16,488
<i>and we may not be
able to control everything,</i>

258
00:24:17,923 --> 00:24:22,260
<i>we're still the main protagonist
in our own stories.</i>

259
00:24:23,061 --> 00:24:25,664
<i>We can still get a hold of our fate.</i>

260
00:24:27,499 --> 00:24:31,970
<i>Even those powerful people
in our lives keep changing.</i>

261
00:24:33,405 --> 00:24:36,942
Because if we don't
learn anything from our history,

262
00:24:37,609 --> 00:24:39,444
if we don't fight

263
00:24:40,545 --> 00:24:42,981
for our progress and others…

264
00:24:44,416 --> 00:24:47,652
we won't be able to fix our present.

265
00:24:49,855 --> 00:24:51,490
We can't make

266
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:55,760
a progressive future for all of us.

267
00:24:58,396 --> 00:24:59,231
That's why when…

268
00:25:03,134 --> 00:25:04,703
I finished reading

269
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:07,005
Rizal's novels…

270
00:25:11,576 --> 00:25:12,811
Mr. Torres…

271
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:16,181
I was wrong.

272
00:25:19,251 --> 00:25:20,452
You were right.

273
00:25:24,289 --> 00:25:29,060
There's a connection
between studying history,

274
00:25:31,062 --> 00:25:32,564
Philippine culture,

275
00:25:34,266 --> 00:25:36,268
and the story of us Filipinos

276
00:25:37,269 --> 00:25:38,737
in our Nursing program.

277
00:25:41,907 --> 00:25:43,241
In my life…

278
00:25:46,177 --> 00:25:47,379
As a daughter…

279
00:25:50,749 --> 00:25:51,783
Sister…

280
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:55,153
Student…

281
00:25:58,356 --> 00:25:59,724
As a person.

282
00:26:03,662 --> 00:26:05,397
And most importantly…

283
00:26:06,431 --> 00:26:08,199
as a Filipino.

284
00:26:57,716 --> 00:26:59,918
Ms. Maria Clara Infantes.

285
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:03,722
Mr. Torres?

286
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:06,458
What's up?

287
00:27:07,025 --> 00:27:09,527
Do you have a new book
you want me to read?

288
00:27:10,261 --> 00:27:12,497
Haven't I done enough reading?

289
00:27:12,564 --> 00:27:15,400
Or maybe my book report wasn't enough?

290
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:18,837
I need the <i>El Filibusterismo</i> book back.

291
00:27:19,404 --> 00:27:20,672
Oh right, sorry.

292
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:40,792
This is your version of the story.

293
00:27:42,093 --> 00:27:44,629
And this is the real story.

294
00:27:47,365 --> 00:27:48,633
The truth is

295
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,835
we can no longer change

296
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:53,672
the stories of Jose Rizal.

297
00:27:54,439 --> 00:27:57,442
Just like we can't change the past.

298
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:02,213
So what's the point of everything I did

299
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:04,416
in the book, if we can't change it?

300
00:28:06,785 --> 00:28:08,153
You learned.

301
00:28:10,221 --> 00:28:14,492
When you entered Jose Rizal's book,

302
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:15,860
<i>what was it for you?</i>

303
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:18,863
<i>Was it a dream or reality?</i>

304
00:28:37,749 --> 00:28:38,850
Mother of God!

305
00:28:41,619 --> 00:28:43,088
Who are you?

306
00:28:43,154 --> 00:28:44,923
I should be the one
asking you that, woman.

307
00:28:52,464 --> 00:28:54,099
It was very real.

308
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,434
Well then.

309
00:28:57,235 --> 00:28:59,537
That's the point of all this.

310
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:02,741
It changed you.

311
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:06,511
And…

312
00:29:07,145 --> 00:29:09,214
You also made the characters change

313
00:29:10,215 --> 00:29:13,518
in the version of a world
that you've created for them.

314
00:29:57,262 --> 00:29:58,363
I think this is for you.

315
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:07,372
Oh, sorry.

316
00:30:21,286 --> 00:30:23,188
Maria Clara's necklace.

317
00:30:51,749 --> 00:30:53,218
<i>A present</i>

318
00:30:53,284 --> 00:30:56,321
<i>must be pure and untarnished</i>

319
00:30:56,387 --> 00:30:59,724
<i>for a person to accept it.</i>

320
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:03,127
<i>Whatever change had taken place…</i>

321
00:31:04,562 --> 00:31:07,265
<i>I hope you'll accept my gift for you.</i>

322
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:09,834
<i>From Maria Clara</i>

323
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:13,037
<i>to Maria Clara.</i>

324
00:31:13,638 --> 00:31:14,772
<i>With my love…</i>

325
00:31:16,841 --> 00:31:18,409
<i>and my goodbye…</i>

326
00:31:26,451 --> 00:31:28,620
-Crisostomo Ibarra.
-<i>Crisostomo Ibarra.</i>

327
00:31:46,537 --> 00:31:47,939
Can I help you with that?

328
00:32:04,689 --> 00:32:06,157
Wear that

329
00:32:07,325 --> 00:32:08,192
proudly,

330
00:32:10,361 --> 00:32:13,898
the stories you've experienced.

331
00:32:17,035 --> 00:32:19,837
-Listen to us!
-Listen to us!

332
00:32:19,904 --> 00:32:22,573
-Listen to us!
-Listen to us!

333
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:26,778
-Listen to us!
-Listen to us!

334
00:32:26,844 --> 00:32:28,913
Listen to us!

335
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:30,381
Listen to us!

336
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:32,150
Listen to us!

337
00:32:32,216 --> 00:32:33,751
Listen to us!

338
00:32:33,818 --> 00:32:35,119
Listen to us!

339
00:32:35,186 --> 00:32:36,487
Listen to us!

340
00:32:37,855 --> 00:32:38,723
<i>Instill therein…</i>

341
00:32:40,191 --> 00:32:41,592
<i>the characters that you learn to love…</i>

342
00:32:50,702 --> 00:32:52,337
EDUCATION IS A RIGHT OF THE PEOPLE

343
00:32:53,604 --> 00:32:56,975
<i>…and make them a part of your identity.</i>

344
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:16,828
<i>Every day of your life.</i>

345
00:33:24,168 --> 00:33:25,837
Instill them here…

346
00:33:27,038 --> 00:33:28,373
and here.

347
00:34:03,941 --> 00:34:05,143
You finally passed

348
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:06,644
this back subject.

349
00:34:09,947 --> 00:34:11,349
You'll be able to march.

350
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:20,358
Congratulations,
Ms. Maria Clara Infantes.

351
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:31,069
UNIVERSITY OF THE CITY OF MANILA

352
00:34:32,637 --> 00:34:34,839
Congratulations, dear!

353
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:42,480
Thank you, Mom.

354
00:34:56,661 --> 00:34:58,796
It's too bad.

355
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:02,266
Too bad Elias is not here.

356
00:35:02,333 --> 00:35:06,170
His final exams
coincided with your graduation.

357
00:35:06,237 --> 00:35:08,139
Gosh. That's all right.

358
00:35:08,206 --> 00:35:10,141
We will pick him up later
and let's have dinner.

359
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:13,478
This is it.

360
00:35:33,364 --> 00:35:34,398
Klay.

361
00:35:35,833 --> 00:35:38,202
Klay, who are you looking for?

362
00:35:39,437 --> 00:35:40,404
Your father?

363
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:10,168
Klay?

364
00:36:14,071 --> 00:36:14,939
Klay?

365
00:36:17,775 --> 00:36:19,410
Did you text that me you're coming today?

366
00:36:21,712 --> 00:36:23,948
No, I just dropped by
since I'm in the area.

367
00:36:24,715 --> 00:36:27,185
Okay. Are you struggling right now?

368
00:36:27,251 --> 00:36:28,553
Do you need some money?

369
00:36:28,619 --> 00:36:29,921
Ah no, I don't.

370
00:36:33,391 --> 00:36:35,726
Is that only what you think of me?

371
00:36:37,762 --> 00:36:39,096
Well, come to think of it.

372
00:36:39,664 --> 00:36:45,069
One hand would be enough to count
the number of times that I came to you.

373
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:48,472
And it was always about money, right?

374
00:36:50,942 --> 00:36:52,443
Klay, I have to go somewhere.

375
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:53,511
What do you need?

376
00:36:54,011 --> 00:36:55,813
What do I need?

377
00:37:01,085 --> 00:37:03,688
I need to tell you…

378
00:37:04,989 --> 00:37:06,524
that I don't need you.

379
00:37:07,825 --> 00:37:08,826
What?

380
00:37:11,662 --> 00:37:12,863
I'm sorry.

381
00:37:14,031 --> 00:37:18,736
The truth is I practiced
a different speech on my way here.

382
00:37:20,538 --> 00:37:22,773
To be honest, I do want to see you.

383
00:37:24,976 --> 00:37:26,811
But never mind.

384
00:37:27,945 --> 00:37:29,747
What I want to tell you is…

385
00:37:32,783 --> 00:37:36,153
aside from the spare change
that I need to beg from you,

386
00:37:36,988 --> 00:37:38,089
I did it.

387
00:37:41,859 --> 00:37:43,027
Klay…

388
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:45,263
I don't need you.

389
00:37:47,164 --> 00:37:50,034
I didn't need you for me to raise well.

390
00:37:52,803 --> 00:37:56,941
Mom and I didn't need you
when we were having a hard time.

391
00:37:57,908 --> 00:37:59,277
We survived.

392
00:38:01,212 --> 00:38:03,014
And all the more that I don't need you

393
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:07,084
so I can come back home and overcome
everything I went through in San Diego.

394
00:38:07,785 --> 00:38:08,953
San Diego?

395
00:38:13,524 --> 00:38:14,725
It's just that…

396
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:16,661
I don't need you.

397
00:38:18,162 --> 00:38:19,730
Because to tell you the truth…

398
00:38:22,199 --> 00:38:26,337
I never felt that you were there for me.

399
00:38:28,372 --> 00:38:30,041
So, I endured it myself.

400
00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:34,979
Mom and I were able to do it by ourselves.

401
00:38:37,415 --> 00:38:40,785
I paid for my schooling.

402
00:38:42,553 --> 00:38:44,555
I managed to finish it,

403
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:47,525
without you.

404
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:50,695
And now,

405
00:38:53,464 --> 00:38:55,533
I will graduate with a degree in nursing

406
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:58,069
without you.

407
00:39:01,138 --> 00:39:02,773
You're graduating?

408
00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:10,414
Yes.

409
00:39:14,585 --> 00:39:16,253
I'm annoyed!

410
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:22,960
I'm annoyed because I'm angry at you.

411
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:25,096
I'm furious with you.

412
00:39:26,864 --> 00:39:28,799
I shouldn't be needing you.

413
00:39:31,936 --> 00:39:34,972
But Dad, I still want
you to be proud of me.

414
00:39:37,575 --> 00:39:41,078
That what you consider
a mistake in your life…

415
00:39:42,913 --> 00:39:44,615
she overcame everything.

416
00:39:50,187 --> 00:39:52,490
It wasn't part of my speech, but

417
00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:55,059
I became stronger.

418
00:39:58,863 --> 00:40:02,600
But honestly,
it's tough to live like this.

419
00:40:06,103 --> 00:40:09,673
It's tough to live being angry with you.

420
00:40:10,608 --> 00:40:14,979
The truth is, I'm longing
for a father's love.

421
00:40:18,849 --> 00:40:22,920
I want to have a father who will hug me…

422
00:40:23,687 --> 00:40:27,291
or even just say, "Good job, Klay".

423
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:32,329
Don't you think I deserve that, right Dad?

424
00:40:40,738 --> 00:40:43,441
I am still hoping things
will change between us.

425
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:49,113
All right.

426
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:51,315
I will stop now.

427
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:53,651
I'm sorry.

428
00:40:53,717 --> 00:40:55,386
I'm sorry for coming here.

429
00:41:09,934 --> 00:41:10,835
Klay.

430
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:15,039
Who are you looking for?

431
00:41:17,608 --> 00:41:18,542
No one.

432
00:41:19,543 --> 00:41:20,811
Just my batchmates.

433
00:41:25,115 --> 00:41:26,917
Don't be sad, okay?

434
00:41:27,718 --> 00:41:31,422
There's a lot of reasons
for us to be happy today, okay?

435
00:41:33,057 --> 00:41:33,991
So smile.

436
00:41:34,058 --> 00:41:34,892
There.

437
00:41:35,459 --> 00:41:36,727
Like that.

438
00:41:39,697 --> 00:41:40,731
Klay?

439
00:41:48,572 --> 00:41:50,875
UNIVERSITY OF THE CITY OF MANILA

440
00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:02,586
UNIVERSITY OF THE CITY OF MANILA

441
00:42:07,591 --> 00:42:09,393
Congratulations, dear.

442
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:10,594
I'm sorry.

443
00:42:11,428 --> 00:42:12,630
I'm late.

444
00:42:13,664 --> 00:42:14,832
I'm proud of you, dear.

445
00:42:18,903 --> 00:42:20,838
UNIVERSITY OF THE CITY OF MANILA

446
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:22,673
Thank you.

447
00:42:36,687 --> 00:42:37,888
Ms. Infantes.

448
00:42:48,766 --> 00:42:51,135
Mom. Dad.

449
00:42:51,201 --> 00:42:53,771
This is Mr. Torres.

450
00:42:53,837 --> 00:42:55,673
My Philippine Studies professor.

451
00:42:56,807 --> 00:43:00,411
I congratulate you on your daughter Klay.

452
00:43:00,477 --> 00:43:02,012
I'm so proud of this young woman.

453
00:43:03,614 --> 00:43:04,882
Thank you.

454
00:43:06,617 --> 00:43:07,918
Ah, right.

455
00:43:07,985 --> 00:43:11,322
I just dropped by to give
you your graduation gift.

456
00:43:11,388 --> 00:43:12,556
Oh!

457
00:43:12,623 --> 00:43:13,691
You don't have to, sir!

458
00:43:13,757 --> 00:43:15,225
Gosh!

459
00:43:15,292 --> 00:43:18,329
What's this?
I wonder where you got this from.

460
00:43:18,395 --> 00:43:19,496
Then open it.

461
00:43:32,843 --> 00:43:35,613
I found a scholarship program

462
00:43:35,679 --> 00:43:37,281
and I'm able to get you in.

463
00:43:38,015 --> 00:43:41,118
I sent them your records and,

464
00:43:41,185 --> 00:43:45,122
goodness, there were a lot
of recommendations from the school admin

465
00:43:45,189 --> 00:43:47,157
and from your other professors.

466
00:43:47,224 --> 00:43:48,425
So there!

467
00:43:49,927 --> 00:43:51,962
You'll be able to save money there

468
00:43:53,230 --> 00:43:55,065
and you can send some back to your family.

469
00:43:55,833 --> 00:43:59,503
And I hope you gain a lot of knowledge

470
00:44:00,137 --> 00:44:02,172
that you can bring to our country.

471
00:44:05,075 --> 00:44:06,276
I'm excited

472
00:44:07,044 --> 00:44:11,348
for you to continue healing
and treating this country.

473
00:44:12,449 --> 00:44:13,751
Future

474
00:44:13,817 --> 00:44:18,389
Dr. Maria Clara Infantes.

475
00:44:20,591 --> 00:44:21,959
Gosh, sir!

476
00:44:22,526 --> 00:44:25,396
You keep taking me everywhere.

477
00:44:27,131 --> 00:44:28,499
But…

478
00:44:28,565 --> 00:44:30,367
wherever I end up,

479
00:44:31,168 --> 00:44:33,437
I will always find my way back home.

480
00:44:34,104 --> 00:44:35,606
Good!

481
00:44:37,641 --> 00:44:39,843
Oh! Wow!

482
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:51,889
UNIVERSITY OF THE CITY OF MANILA

483
00:44:55,559 --> 00:45:00,330
Do you mean that
reading <i>Noli</i> is useless?

484
00:45:00,397 --> 00:45:06,403
A book that significantly contributed
to easing the struggles of Filipinos.

485
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:09,673
Submit a book report.

486
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:11,508
And read this one.

487
00:45:12,509 --> 00:45:14,645
You will learn more from this version.

488
00:45:14,712 --> 00:45:16,480
And this book will take you

489
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:18,615
to the world that Jose Rizal created.

490
00:45:18,682 --> 00:45:20,584
So that you can learn the whole history.

491
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:33,764
There's an emergency.

492
00:45:37,267 --> 00:45:38,435
Which book?

493
00:45:38,502 --> 00:45:40,804
-<i>The Preying Birds</i>, sir.
-Well then.

494
00:45:41,371 --> 00:45:42,539
Are you with the others now?

495
00:45:45,909 --> 00:45:47,111
Assist me, okay?

496
00:45:47,177 --> 00:45:50,013
You will show yourselves
only to the characters.

497
00:45:51,081 --> 00:45:53,784
Gosh! I'm too old for
this kind of journey.

498
00:46:10,501 --> 00:46:13,370
Good thing his WBC has stabilized.

499
00:46:14,638 --> 00:46:15,539
All right.

500
00:46:15,606 --> 00:46:18,275
I'll just drop by here
then I'll be there for a second.

501
00:46:19,810 --> 00:46:20,878
All right.

502
00:46:21,779 --> 00:46:23,380
Thank you, girl!

503
00:46:42,833 --> 00:46:44,535
<i>That's why this country remains stagnant</i>

504
00:46:44,601 --> 00:46:47,237
because of Filipinos like you
who don't care about

505
00:46:47,304 --> 00:46:48,772
the true events in history!

506
00:46:50,908 --> 00:46:52,676
It's really hard to love the Philippines.

507
00:46:54,111 --> 00:46:57,481
And to be honest, I have no plans
of working here after I graduate.

508
00:46:58,015 --> 00:47:00,150
If I get a chance to leave,
I will never go back.

509
00:47:06,323 --> 00:47:08,992
And I hope you gain a lot of knowledge

510
00:47:09,059 --> 00:47:10,928
that you can bring back to our country.

511
00:47:10,994 --> 00:47:13,163
Wherever I end up,

512
00:47:13,864 --> 00:47:16,600
I will always find my way back home.

513
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:18,001
Good!

514
00:47:54,838 --> 00:47:55,839
Yes?

515
00:47:55,906 --> 00:47:58,275
Would you know where
I could find Mr. Torres?

516
00:47:58,342 --> 00:48:00,344
The one who teaches Philippine Studies?

517
00:48:00,410 --> 00:48:03,247
Ah, Mr. Torres is gone.

518
00:48:04,915 --> 00:48:06,016
He's dead?

519
00:48:06,516 --> 00:48:08,552
No, he's not yet dead.

520
00:48:08,619 --> 00:48:12,022
What I meant was,
he's not with the university anymore.

521
00:48:12,589 --> 00:48:14,291
Ah, is that so?

522
00:48:15,292 --> 00:48:17,160
Too bad. I came here to see him.

523
00:48:17,227 --> 00:48:18,795
I have a surprise for him.

524
00:48:18,862 --> 00:48:20,530
I brought him a gift.

525
00:48:20,597 --> 00:48:24,134
If you want, you can just
give it to Sir Barry Torres.

526
00:48:24,201 --> 00:48:25,936
He's Mr. Torres's grandson.

527
00:48:27,271 --> 00:48:28,972
Barry Torres?

528
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:31,275
All right. Where is he?

529
00:48:35,245 --> 00:48:36,613
That's Sir Barry.

530
00:48:37,114 --> 00:48:38,548
I'll leave you to it.

531
00:48:38,615 --> 00:48:39,516
Thank you.

532
00:48:40,884 --> 00:48:42,986
I want you to tell me

533
00:48:43,053 --> 00:48:45,822
why Dr. Jose Rizal wrote

534
00:48:45,889 --> 00:48:50,193
<i>Noli Me Tangere</i> and <i>El Filibusterismo.</i>

535
00:48:53,196 --> 00:48:55,065
I want you to write
a book report about it.

536
00:48:55,966 --> 00:48:57,567
Submit it to me next month, okay?

537
00:48:57,634 --> 00:48:59,002
-Okay, sir.
-Okay, sir.

538
00:49:11,281 --> 00:49:12,149
Ah, Mr. Torres!

539
00:49:12,215 --> 00:49:13,283
Mr. Barry To--

540
00:49:19,056 --> 00:49:20,090
Sir Ibarra?

541
00:49:31,168 --> 00:49:32,602
Are you my former student?

542
00:49:41,945 --> 00:49:44,214
My real name is Ibarra Gonzalo Torres.

543
00:49:44,281 --> 00:49:45,248
But…

544
00:49:45,849 --> 00:49:47,484
just call me Barry.

545
00:49:50,787 --> 00:49:52,422
And you are…

546
00:49:54,658 --> 00:49:56,393
Dr. Klay Infantes.

547
00:49:59,896 --> 00:50:02,532
Mr. Torres's former student.

548
00:50:02,599 --> 00:50:03,667
Your grandfather.

549
00:50:04,267 --> 00:50:06,303
Nice to meet you, Dr. Infantes.

550
00:50:07,337 --> 00:50:09,006
So, you used to be
my grandfather's student.

551
00:50:10,607 --> 00:50:11,808
Just call me Klay.

552
00:50:15,112 --> 00:50:16,380
Why are you here?

553
00:50:17,547 --> 00:50:18,548
Are you going to teach here?

554
00:50:19,549 --> 00:50:20,617
No.

555
00:50:20,684 --> 00:50:22,319
I came here to visit him.

556
00:50:22,386 --> 00:50:23,720
I brought him something.

557
00:50:27,657 --> 00:50:28,692
Okay.

558
00:50:29,559 --> 00:50:30,794
I'll just give it to him.

559
00:50:30,861 --> 00:50:31,828
But…

560
00:50:32,496 --> 00:50:33,730
he's busier than I am.

561
00:50:39,002 --> 00:50:40,270
That's so sad.

562
00:50:41,371 --> 00:50:43,640
So Mr. Torres doesn't
teach here at PLM anymore?

563
00:50:44,641 --> 00:50:47,144
But sometimes, he visits.

564
00:50:52,516 --> 00:50:53,717
Maria Clara?

565
00:50:56,353 --> 00:50:59,790
That's great. She's a <i>Noli</i>
and <i>El Fili</i> fan.

566
00:51:00,824 --> 00:51:02,959
By the way, Dr. Infantes, this is Clarize.

567
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:05,695
She's a music teacher here and

568
00:51:05,762 --> 00:51:06,963
she's my wife.

569
00:51:07,631 --> 00:51:09,800
The soon-to-be mother of my child.

570
00:51:13,570 --> 00:51:15,505
Can I also teach there?

571
00:51:15,572 --> 00:51:16,673
Just like the…

572
00:51:17,207 --> 00:51:19,342
the nuns at the convent.

573
00:51:19,409 --> 00:51:20,644
That even taught us,

574
00:51:21,878 --> 00:51:22,813
music.

575
00:51:24,147 --> 00:51:26,216
Clarize, this is Dr. Infantes.

576
00:51:27,451 --> 00:51:29,319
Grandpa's former student.

577
00:51:29,386 --> 00:51:30,787
Oh.

578
00:51:32,055 --> 00:51:33,623
Nice to meet you, doctor.

579
00:51:57,380 --> 00:51:59,950
You remind me of my best friend.

580
00:52:08,158 --> 00:52:10,427
They finally got their happy ending.

581
00:52:18,902 --> 00:52:20,237
For your career,

582
00:52:21,438 --> 00:52:22,839
for the two of you,

583
00:52:24,641 --> 00:52:25,809
for your baby.

584
00:52:37,621 --> 00:52:38,522
You can count on that.

585
00:52:38,588 --> 00:52:40,323
I'll always visit here.

586
00:52:44,828 --> 00:52:45,962
Sorry.

587
00:52:46,029 --> 00:52:47,998
Can I hug you both again

588
00:52:48,064 --> 00:52:49,566
but this time with consent?

589
00:53:16,459 --> 00:53:18,061
Well then, Dr. Infantes.

590
00:53:18,128 --> 00:53:20,063
We still have a faculty meeting to attend.

591
00:53:20,130 --> 00:53:21,565
And we might be late.

592
00:53:21,631 --> 00:53:23,500
I'll just give it to grandpa.

593
00:53:23,567 --> 00:53:25,635
And tell him that you visited here.

594
00:53:26,136 --> 00:53:27,837
Okay, thank you. You two take care.

595
00:53:32,042 --> 00:53:32,943
Until then.

596
00:53:33,944 --> 00:53:35,011
You can count on it.

597
00:53:36,112 --> 00:53:37,714
Okay. You two take care.

598
00:53:37,781 --> 00:53:39,583
Let's go. We might be late.

599
00:53:57,234 --> 00:53:59,302
<i>I love you very much.</i>

600
00:54:00,370 --> 00:54:01,838
<i>I love you very much too…</i>

601
00:54:03,773 --> 00:54:04,941
My Ms. Klay.

602
00:54:31,301 --> 00:54:33,136
Is there anything new written on it?

603
00:54:35,639 --> 00:54:37,140
None.

604
00:54:37,207 --> 00:54:38,575
There's nothing new written here.

605
00:54:58,328 --> 00:54:59,763
You don't have a fever.

606
00:55:02,766 --> 00:55:05,869
But you looked pale and weak all along.

607
00:55:09,139 --> 00:55:10,340
Is it because of your wound--

608
00:55:10,407 --> 00:55:12,342
It's just a bullet graze wound, Ms. Klay.

609
00:55:15,312 --> 00:55:16,446
You know what?

610
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:20,383
Maybe your body is taking revenge on you.

611
00:55:20,450 --> 00:55:24,654
You must rest from
time to time to regain your strength.

612
00:55:25,822 --> 00:55:27,691
These vegetables will soon be cooked.

613
00:55:28,925 --> 00:55:31,861
You need nourishment
so you'll gain strength

614
00:55:31,928 --> 00:55:33,730
because this fight
still has a long way to go.

615
00:55:34,731 --> 00:55:35,832
It seems like…

616
00:55:36,566 --> 00:55:38,401
I am feeling much better.

617
00:55:41,071 --> 00:55:43,606
Now that I am looking at you,

618
00:55:44,607 --> 00:55:45,475
I feel like

619
00:55:46,876 --> 00:55:49,879
my beloved wife is cooking for me.

620
00:55:52,882 --> 00:55:54,117
What wife?

621
00:55:54,684 --> 00:55:55,919
I could be like a mother too.

622
00:56:23,012 --> 00:56:24,381
There you go.

623
00:56:24,948 --> 00:56:26,483
Let me taste the food…

624
00:56:27,317 --> 00:56:28,485
that my wife cooked for me.

625
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:38,495
Is it good?

626
00:56:38,561 --> 00:56:39,829
Extraordinary!

627
00:56:42,265 --> 00:56:44,067
You're indeed my wife, Ms. Klay!

628
00:56:46,236 --> 00:56:51,207
It's my first time tasting this kind

629
00:56:51,274 --> 00:56:52,609
of sauteed vegetables.

630
00:56:53,209 --> 00:56:57,480
My spirit was indeed lifted
because of your sumptuous love.

631
00:56:57,547 --> 00:56:58,415
It's your turn.

632
00:56:59,783 --> 00:57:00,884
Say ah.

633
00:57:11,094 --> 00:57:13,263
How about him? Will I ever see him again?

634
00:57:17,934 --> 00:57:19,769
In whatever version,

635
00:57:20,670 --> 00:57:22,405
in whatever way…

636
00:57:26,042 --> 00:57:28,011
even in a dream again…

637
00:57:30,447 --> 00:57:32,348
I hope we meet again.

638
00:57:35,985 --> 00:57:36,953
Multiverse,

639
00:57:37,020 --> 00:57:38,721
give me some crumbs of Fidel.

640
00:57:49,132 --> 00:57:51,434
But of course, life goes on.

641
00:57:53,603 --> 00:57:55,038
The fight is still on.

642
00:58:05,849 --> 00:58:07,283
How are you, sir?

643
00:58:07,350 --> 00:58:08,551
I'm all right.

644
00:58:09,385 --> 00:58:10,753
Are you eating well?

645
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:12,188
Yes, he is, doctor.

646
00:58:13,523 --> 00:58:15,158
Let's check it again, okay?

647
00:58:15,825 --> 00:58:18,895
<i>We don't need to be a national hero,</i>

648
00:58:18,962 --> 00:58:23,466
<i>a mythological figure,
or a character in a novel</i>

649
00:58:23,533 --> 00:58:27,604
<i>to work with others
toward change and progress.</i>

650
00:58:28,605 --> 00:58:30,974
<i>As long as it comes from the heart.</i>

651
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:32,575
You have elevated blood pressure, sir.

652
00:58:32,642 --> 00:58:34,811
It's 150/100.

653
00:58:34,878 --> 00:58:36,312
But not that very high.

654
00:58:36,379 --> 00:58:38,848
Try to go for a run in the morning

655
00:58:38,915 --> 00:58:40,917
and do some exercise
to regulate your blood pressure.

656
00:58:42,886 --> 00:58:44,320
And here ma'am,

657
00:58:45,121 --> 00:58:48,625
give sir 50 milligrams once
a day, every morning, okay?

658
00:58:49,425 --> 00:58:51,528
And sir, I will ask you to stay away

659
00:58:51,594 --> 00:58:53,963
from fatty and oily foods, okay?

660
00:58:54,030 --> 00:58:55,365
See, I told you.

661
00:58:55,431 --> 00:58:56,900
You are not getting any younger,

662
00:58:56,966 --> 00:58:59,102
so you should eat
more fruits and vegetables, okay?

663
00:59:00,403 --> 00:59:01,804
-Thank you.
-Those are good.

664
00:59:02,839 --> 00:59:04,073
You two take care!

665
00:59:04,140 --> 00:59:05,041
All right.

666
00:59:05,108 --> 00:59:05,975
Let's go, Dad.

667
00:59:06,042 --> 00:59:07,977
See, I told you. Avoid eating…

668
00:59:08,044 --> 00:59:08,912
Is that all?

669
00:59:09,612 --> 00:59:11,381

Ali?

675
00:59:30,667 --> 00:59:31,868
Mr. Torres?

676
00:59:39,075 --> 00:59:40,610
One moment, okay? I'll be back.

677
00:59:40,677 --> 00:59:42,145
All right, doctor.
