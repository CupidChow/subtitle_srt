00:00:28,395 --> 00:00:31,564
MARIA CLARA AND IBARRA

2
00:00:31,631 --> 00:00:35,568
THIS PROGRAM, WHICH IS ADAPTED
FROM THE NOVELS OF DR. JOSE P. RIZAL,

3
00:00:35,635 --> 00:00:40,573
IS PRESENTED USING DRAMATIC ELEMENTS
TO CONNECT THE PRESENT AND THE PAST

4
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:46,379
IN A SPECIAL REIMAGINING OF THE NATIONAL
LITERATURE FILIPINOS ARE PROUD OF.

5
00:00:46,446 --> 00:00:47,480
<i>They're coming!</i>

6
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:48,681
<i>I won't leave you.</i>

7
00:00:48,748 --> 00:00:50,650
<i>I will save you.</i>

8
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:51,918
Between the two of us,

9
00:00:51,985 --> 00:00:53,420
<i>you're the one who needs to be saved.</i>

10
00:00:53,486 --> 00:00:54,421
<i>Get out of here now.</i>

11
00:00:54,487 --> 00:00:55,922
<i>Save yourself.</i>

12
00:00:55,989 --> 00:00:58,324
<i>See, General?</i>

13
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:00,326
<i>Ibarra is a traitor.</i>

14
00:01:00,393 --> 00:01:01,661
<i>Compare the two.</i>

15
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:04,631
<i>It is the same handwriting
in both letters, isn't it?</i>

16
00:01:04,697 --> 00:01:08,234
That is why I'm sure
that it was indeed Crisostomo Ibarra

17
00:01:08,301 --> 00:01:09,569
<i>who wrote the letter.</i>

18
00:01:09,636 --> 00:01:11,704
Don't let them escape.

19
00:01:11,771 --> 00:01:13,440
<i>Don't worry, Father.</i>

20
00:01:13,506 --> 00:01:15,175
They are surrounded by the civil guards.

21
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:19,145
<i>Do everything so that they can't
get out of here alive.</i>

22
00:01:19,212 --> 00:01:20,680
<i>You have my sympathies, kid.</i>

23
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:22,949
<i>Our lives have become tragic.</i>

24
00:01:23,016 --> 00:01:24,150
<i>But you.</i>

25
00:01:24,217 --> 00:01:28,021
<i>You have a chance to have a better life.</i>

26
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:29,689
<i>I don't want to live anymore.</i>

27
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:31,558
They took everything from me.

28
00:01:31,624 --> 00:01:34,427
There's no reason left for me to live!

29
00:01:34,494 --> 00:01:36,796
Whatever it is that you
are feeling right now,

30
00:01:36,863 --> 00:01:38,531
use that to fight.

31
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:40,300
<i>You are not safe here.</i>

32
00:01:40,366 --> 00:01:41,935
<i>I will take care of your mother.</i>

33
00:01:42,001 --> 00:01:42,936
<i>Go now.</i>

34
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:45,205
<i>Elias?</i>

35
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:46,673
<i>You were shot.</i>

36
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:48,241
<i>Wait, what happened?</i>

37
00:01:48,308 --> 00:01:49,776
We waited for you at the graveyard.

38
00:01:49,843 --> 00:01:50,810
<i>We were about to escape.</i>

39
00:01:51,311 --> 00:01:53,113
<i>But they were able to track us down.</i>

40
00:01:53,179 --> 00:01:54,514
<i>Leave me.</i>

41
00:01:54,581 --> 00:01:55,815
And just let you die here?

42
00:01:55,882 --> 00:01:58,751
<i>But I can't leave Ms. Sisa.</i>

43
00:01:59,352 --> 00:02:00,186
<i>Sisa…</i>

44
00:02:01,421 --> 00:02:03,556
Sisa…

45
00:02:05,258 --> 00:02:06,493
<i>Klay, please calm down.</i>

46
00:02:06,559 --> 00:02:08,561
Look what is happening.

47
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:09,996
You're so calm.

48
00:02:10,063 --> 00:02:11,664
Is all of this nothing to you?

49
00:02:11,731 --> 00:02:14,934
You just don't see it,
but my heart is breaking.

50
00:02:15,001 --> 00:02:16,703
<i>This is not the time to contemplate.</i>

51
00:02:16,769 --> 00:02:19,939
<i>We need to be alert,
and I need to protect you.</i>

52
00:02:20,006 --> 00:02:23,276
Because if you'll be gone too,
I might not be able to bear it.

53
00:02:23,343 --> 00:02:24,577
<i>We saw someone over there.</i>

54
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:26,012
It might be them.

55
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:27,747
Move faster before they get away.

56
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:29,549
<i>Promise me, Fidel.</i>

57
00:02:30,116 --> 00:02:30,950
Promise you what?

58
00:02:31,017 --> 00:02:33,153
Promise me that you will not die.

59
00:02:33,753 --> 00:02:34,587
I promise.

60
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:36,823
Hands up! Don't move!

61
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:38,591
Stay behind me, Ms. Klay.

62
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:40,627
I will not let them hurt you.

63
00:02:40,693 --> 00:02:42,028
PREVIOUSLY…

64
00:02:42,095 --> 00:02:43,429
Ali?

65
00:02:53,573 --> 00:02:54,474
Pablito?

66
00:02:57,677 --> 00:02:59,712
Put that down. I know them.

67
00:03:10,223 --> 00:03:11,491
What are you doing here?

68
00:03:12,792 --> 00:03:14,594
Pablito, it's Elias.

69
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:17,230
Is that you, Pablito?

70
00:03:20,433 --> 00:03:21,267
Yes, Elias.

71
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:25,872
You are seriously wounded.

72
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:27,807
Come. We'll take you back to the camp.

73
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:28,875
No!

74
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:32,545
I'm not done here.

75
00:03:32,612 --> 00:03:34,547
We will not leave you here.

76
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:37,917
All of us will die here
if you don't leave.

77
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:41,621
You are not dying, Elias.

78
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:43,223
Ms. Klay.

79
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:48,728
My time has come.

80
00:03:59,372 --> 00:04:00,373
My friend…

81
00:04:06,179 --> 00:04:08,314
I have a favor to ask you.

82
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,479
Look after Salome.

83
00:04:44,017 --> 00:04:46,519
Why are you making that request?

84
00:04:57,263 --> 00:04:58,598
Someone's coming.

85
00:05:01,701 --> 00:05:03,236
We need to leave.

86
00:05:05,738 --> 00:05:07,240
Get out of here.

87
00:05:08,441 --> 00:05:09,809
Leave me now.

88
00:05:10,543 --> 00:05:12,578
Save yourselves.

89
00:05:15,682 --> 00:05:18,318
No! I still need to treat your wound.

90
00:05:18,384 --> 00:05:20,853
Come on. Let's carry him, Pablito.

91
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:21,954
Pablito!

92
00:05:23,556 --> 00:05:25,658
Miss, that's enough.

93
00:05:25,725 --> 00:05:28,094
I will only slow down your escape.

94
00:05:30,897 --> 00:05:31,931
Ms. Klay.

95
00:05:35,935 --> 00:05:37,970
I need to stop them.

96
00:05:52,652 --> 00:05:54,220
I will die…

97
00:05:57,557 --> 00:06:03,663
without witnessing the sunrise…

98
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:06,833
for our country.

99
00:06:28,621 --> 00:06:30,223
You who still have the chance to see it.

100
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:35,495
Welcome it.

101
00:06:39,298 --> 00:06:40,533
And may you never forget…

102
00:06:43,936 --> 00:06:47,907
what defeated the darkness of the night.

103
00:06:55,214 --> 00:06:56,215
Go.

104
00:06:59,652 --> 00:07:00,787
Go now.

105
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:06,692
Go now.

106
00:08:20,733 --> 00:08:22,368
Gentlemen!

107
00:08:22,435 --> 00:08:24,971
Search the forest!

108
00:08:25,037 --> 00:08:27,106
Hurry! Hurry!

109
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:28,007
Hurry!

110
00:08:38,951 --> 00:08:40,086
Wait.

111
00:08:51,397 --> 00:08:54,600
Do you think Father
has news about Crisostomo?

112
00:08:54,667 --> 00:08:57,770
He already went there this morning.

113
00:08:59,939 --> 00:09:04,343
A dream is usually
the opposite of reality.

114
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:07,580
I'm sure Crisostomo is safe.

115
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:16,355
-Father.
-Maria.

116
00:09:16,422 --> 00:09:18,391
General.

117
00:09:18,457 --> 00:09:19,859
Good morning.

118
00:09:27,767 --> 00:09:29,702
We found two corpses.

119
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:32,505
Whose bodies?

120
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,173
They couldn't identify them

121
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:37,310
because the bodies were completely burnt.

122
00:09:37,977 --> 00:09:39,445
My God!

123
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:43,516
And we found this

124
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:47,987
beside one of the bodies.

125
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:52,224
Captain Tiago said he knows who owns it.

126
00:10:04,303 --> 00:10:07,640
<i>Our love is bound in prayers, my love.</i>

127
00:10:07,707 --> 00:10:12,345
<i>Promise me that our love
will always be with you,</i>

128
00:10:12,411 --> 00:10:14,213
<i>as well as that rosary.</i>

129
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:20,219
Clarita.

130
00:10:21,554 --> 00:10:22,788
Isn't that yours?

131
00:10:22,855 --> 00:10:25,725
I gave this to Crisostomo before
the formal wedding proposal.

132
00:10:27,893 --> 00:10:29,195
For heaven's sake!

133
00:10:30,563 --> 00:10:32,064
<i>I will come back for you, Maria.</i>

134
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:33,899
Will you wait for me again?

135
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:36,969
No matter how long it takes.

136
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:39,338
I will wait for you, Crisostomo.

137
00:10:39,405 --> 00:10:41,273
You have to stay alive.

138
00:10:45,911 --> 00:10:46,812
No.

139
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,348
No.

140
00:10:49,415 --> 00:10:50,783
My dear.

141
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:52,318
No.

142
00:10:53,786 --> 00:10:55,454
-No.
-My dear.

143
00:10:58,357 --> 00:10:59,825
No.

144
00:10:59,892 --> 00:11:01,661
That's not true.

145
00:11:01,727 --> 00:11:03,029
I don't believe it.

146
00:11:03,629 --> 00:11:05,031
That's not true, Auntie.

147
00:11:12,805 --> 00:11:17,076
Crisostomo!

148
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:20,846
Crisostomo!

149
00:11:32,725 --> 00:11:34,727
Auntie.

150
00:11:37,263 --> 00:11:38,397
Auntie.

151
00:11:38,464 --> 00:11:41,300
No, Crisostomo! This can't be!

152
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:42,935
No…

153
00:11:50,109 --> 00:11:51,844
My love!

154
00:11:54,947 --> 00:11:57,249
Crisostomo…

155
00:11:57,316 --> 00:11:59,151
My God…

156
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:14,734
Klay.

157
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:18,904
You need to eat.

158
00:12:18,971 --> 00:12:21,874
So you can fill up your stomach.

159
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:28,714
I don't feel like eating.

160
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,755
And I won't be able to eat

161
00:12:35,821 --> 00:12:38,324
until I find out where Sir Ibarra is.

162
00:12:39,158 --> 00:12:41,727
We haven't heard from him for hours now.

163
00:12:43,696 --> 00:12:46,866
Let's just wait
for Pablito and the others.

164
00:12:50,703 --> 00:12:51,804
Lucia.

165
00:12:52,471 --> 00:12:53,339
Pablito.

166
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,574
Any news?

167
00:12:57,209 --> 00:12:59,011
We went back to the graveyard.

168
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:02,248
We discovered something dreadful.

169
00:13:02,314 --> 00:13:04,283
Two burnt bodies were found.

170
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:07,286
We suspect that it might be
Sisa and Elias.

171
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:09,955
What?

172
00:13:10,723 --> 00:13:13,392
It looks like Elias burned himself.

173
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:15,461
What?

174
00:13:16,395 --> 00:13:17,863
Why would he do that?

175
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:21,267
Perhaps to confuse the authorities.

176
00:13:22,334 --> 00:13:26,672
So they would think that the burnt bodies
belong to Ibarra and Elias.

177
00:13:38,751 --> 00:13:41,153
Does that mean
Ibarra hasn't been found yet?

178
00:13:41,787 --> 00:13:43,289
No one has seen him yet.

179
00:13:46,692 --> 00:13:48,394
There's a possibility
that he's still alive.

180
00:13:48,894 --> 00:13:51,063
We can't be sure, Klay.

181
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:52,898
The forest is dense.

182
00:13:52,965 --> 00:13:54,266
If he is still alive,

183
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:57,269
we will have a hard time
searching for him in the forest.

184
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:00,840
But there's a possibility that he's alive.

185
00:14:00,906 --> 00:14:02,441
He will surely make his presence known.

186
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:04,143
He will show up.

187
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:06,345
Klay.

188
00:14:06,412 --> 00:14:08,881
If he hasn't appeared to us yet,

189
00:14:11,617 --> 00:14:12,818
then you need to accept

190
00:14:12,885 --> 00:14:15,387
that Crisostomo Ibarra
may already be dead.

191
00:14:35,274 --> 00:14:36,642
My dear.

192
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:38,677
Please say something.

193
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:42,581
I know how terrible you feel.

194
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:47,319
And it is even more painful
when your loved one dies.

195
00:14:48,587 --> 00:14:50,289
I experienced it.

196
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:53,626
When your mother died,

197
00:14:54,193 --> 00:14:55,928
my beloved, Pia Alba.

198
00:14:58,063 --> 00:15:00,566
That was the darkest day of my life.

199
00:15:01,767 --> 00:15:05,037
I felt like my whole world was shattered.

200
00:15:05,104 --> 00:15:06,438
I wanted to die.

201
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:09,942
But I found a reason to keep going.

202
00:15:10,876 --> 00:15:12,077
And that's you, my dear.

203
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:14,780
I believe that someday,

204
00:15:15,781 --> 00:15:21,253
you will also learn to live your life
without Crisostomo.

205
00:15:23,789 --> 00:15:25,324
I want to see him.

206
00:15:27,359 --> 00:15:29,361
I want to see the body.

207
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:30,663
My dear…

208
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:32,698
I want to see him, father.

209
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:36,268
You heard what the General said, right?

210
00:15:37,403 --> 00:15:39,305
The bodies were completely burned.

211
00:15:39,371 --> 00:15:41,540
You might not be able to take it, my dear.

212
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:44,476
You won't recognize him either.

213
00:15:45,844 --> 00:15:47,780
So, it's better for you not to see him.

214
00:15:47,846 --> 00:15:49,548
I want to see him, Father.

215
00:15:50,582 --> 00:15:52,818
I want to see Crisostomo, Father.

216
00:15:52,885 --> 00:15:56,555
If they are saying that my fiancé is gone,

217
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:59,224
if they are saying that Crisostomo
is already dead,

218
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:02,061
then let me say goodbye to him.

219
00:16:04,096 --> 00:16:06,298
I am sorry, my dear,

220
00:16:06,365 --> 00:16:08,934
but it's better for you to stay here.

221
00:16:10,502 --> 00:16:12,805
Tell me that I'm just dreaming.

222
00:16:13,772 --> 00:16:15,341
Tell me.

223
00:16:15,407 --> 00:16:18,210
Tell me that I am just
having a nightmare, Auntie.

224
00:16:18,277 --> 00:16:20,346
Wake me up. Wake me up.

225
00:16:20,946 --> 00:16:24,116
I don't want to live without Crisostomo.

226
00:16:24,183 --> 00:16:26,018
My dear.

227
00:16:28,721 --> 00:16:29,688
My dear.

228
00:16:29,755 --> 00:16:31,290
Stop crying, my dear.

229
00:16:38,063 --> 00:16:41,500
I've heard about what happened,
my Clarita.

230
00:16:46,872 --> 00:16:50,309
We deeply sympathize with you.

231
00:16:52,711 --> 00:16:53,679
You sympathize with us?

232
00:16:58,884 --> 00:17:00,219
All of you…

233
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,889
You killed my fiancé.

234
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:11,363
You…

235
00:17:12,231 --> 00:17:14,266
You killed my fiancé.

236
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:18,570
-You treated him like an animal!
-Maria.

237
00:17:18,637 --> 00:17:20,105
You treated him like an animal!

238
00:17:20,172 --> 00:17:21,740
You are all heartless!

239
00:17:21,807 --> 00:17:23,075
Maria Clara.

240
00:17:23,142 --> 00:17:25,277
Calm down.

241
00:17:25,344 --> 00:17:28,180
Crisostomo is a filibuster.

242
00:17:28,247 --> 00:17:31,283
He is a threat to the government
and the church.

243
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:34,053
If we hadn't stopped him.

244
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:36,722
Who knows what he could've done.

245
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:40,292
You are a follower of God.

246
00:17:41,126 --> 00:17:43,896
Yet you wished for a person's death?

247
00:17:47,499 --> 00:17:50,102
What kind of priest are you?

248
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:53,872
-Maria.
-For God's sake!

249
00:17:53,939 --> 00:17:56,241
For God's sake, do not silence me!

250
00:17:57,776 --> 00:17:58,610
Please!

251
00:17:58,677 --> 00:18:00,712
I don't want to stay silent anymore!

252
00:18:00,779 --> 00:18:02,347
My whole life.

253
00:18:02,948 --> 00:18:05,684
I was always told to be silent!

254
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:07,820
To obey! To listen!

255
00:18:07,886 --> 00:18:11,023
You keep telling me that!

256
00:18:11,857 --> 00:18:16,028
You keep taking away my voice!

257
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:18,163
Gagging me!

258
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:20,833
To the point that I almost become mute!

259
00:18:24,336 --> 00:18:26,405
But not anymore.

260
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:30,509
I will not stay silent anymore.

261
00:18:32,144 --> 00:18:33,912
Now, tell me, Father.

262
00:18:33,979 --> 00:18:35,514
Tell me.

263
00:18:36,882 --> 00:18:38,283
Admit it.

264
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:41,954
That you are one of those people
who ruined Crisostomo's life.

265
00:18:43,021 --> 00:18:44,890
Speak up!

266
00:18:55,367 --> 00:18:59,004
Where are these accusations
coming from, Maria Clara?

267
00:19:00,272 --> 00:19:02,975
You know what I'm talking about, Father.

268
00:19:04,176 --> 00:19:05,944
Now, tell us here.

269
00:19:06,011 --> 00:19:09,781
Tell us what you did
to destroy Crisostomo.

270
00:19:09,848 --> 00:19:11,984
To destroy us both!

271
00:19:13,218 --> 00:19:15,020
Maria,

272
00:19:15,087 --> 00:19:17,156
stop treating the curate that way.

273
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:21,860
I ask forgiveness for my daughter's
actions, Your Reverence.

274
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:26,031
It's all good, Captain Tiago.

275
00:19:26,098 --> 00:19:31,403
Perhaps your daughter is just grieving.

276
00:19:32,938 --> 00:19:34,706
Right, Maria?

277
00:19:36,909 --> 00:19:38,177
All right, my child.

278
00:19:39,878 --> 00:19:43,182
If you really want
to express your sentiments,

279
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:47,786
I will allow it.

280
00:19:48,787 --> 00:19:52,624
So that your father and I can hear it.

281
00:19:53,292 --> 00:19:56,128
You are so cruel! You are so cruel!

282
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:58,163
-Maria!
-You are so cruel!

283
00:19:58,230 --> 00:19:59,264
My child!

284
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:04,503
Why did you let him die?

285
00:20:06,972 --> 00:20:09,875
He is an honorable man!

286
00:20:12,344 --> 00:20:14,446
All he wanted…

287
00:20:14,513 --> 00:20:17,449
was to make San Diego better!

288
00:20:19,952 --> 00:20:22,154
He did that…

289
00:20:22,821 --> 00:20:25,691
even though he knew
he would gain enemies.

290
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:31,029
But you?

291
00:20:31,096 --> 00:20:33,031
What have you accomplished?

292
00:20:33,098 --> 00:20:35,133
What have you done for San Diego, Father?

293
00:20:36,835 --> 00:20:38,403
Now, tell me.

294
00:20:40,772 --> 00:20:42,140
Tell me…

295
00:20:42,641 --> 00:20:46,511
Who is the real heretic and filibuster?

296
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:55,554
Who is the real sinner
and who deserves to die?

297
00:20:58,857 --> 00:20:59,958
Clarita.

298
00:21:00,525 --> 00:21:01,660
Clarita.

299
00:21:02,661 --> 00:21:04,029
Clarita.

300
00:21:07,966 --> 00:21:08,834
Father.

301
00:21:10,135 --> 00:21:12,104
What is my daughter talking about?

302
00:21:14,873 --> 00:21:17,643
I don't know, Captain.

303
00:21:17,709 --> 00:21:18,810
Perhaps,

304
00:21:20,212 --> 00:21:21,680
she has lost her mind

305
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:25,484
because of her grief.

306
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:29,288
Poor child.

307
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:32,891
I will pray for her.

308
00:22:09,628 --> 00:22:10,462
Maria.

309
00:22:12,397 --> 00:22:15,367
I'm really worried about you.

310
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:21,173
I know how you feel.

311
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:24,409
And you want me to believe that lie?

312
00:22:28,213 --> 00:22:29,448
Nevertheless,

313
00:22:31,783 --> 00:22:36,421
now I know how much
you despise the person I love,

314
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:40,826
who is now dead.

315
00:22:45,597 --> 00:22:50,035
Ibarra was a heretic and a filibuster.

316
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:53,839
He got what he deserved.

317
00:22:56,675 --> 00:22:58,877
You will never convince me.

318
00:23:00,512 --> 00:23:03,115
No matter how many times you say that.

319
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:09,121
He's still human.

320
00:23:11,323 --> 00:23:13,258
He was a good person.

321
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:19,765
And we let him die.

322
00:23:24,669 --> 00:23:27,139
My God, I hope you have taken my life too.

323
00:23:31,476 --> 00:23:34,179
Maria, don't say that.

324
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:42,554
You still have a chance to be happy.

325
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:47,159
You can still push through
with your wedding to Linares.

326
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:49,528
You can have a fresh start with him.

327
00:23:50,162 --> 00:23:51,663
Believe me.

328
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:55,333
You will eventually forget Ibarra.

329
00:23:56,201 --> 00:23:57,235
That's a promise.

330
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:01,873
No.

331
00:24:03,041 --> 00:24:05,110
I will never forget Crisostomo.

332
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:12,217
I will never get married,
especially to Alfonso Linares.

333
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:19,958
Sir Ibarra!

334
00:24:22,427 --> 00:24:24,062
Sir Ibarra!

335
00:24:25,697 --> 00:24:26,898
Sir Ibarra!

336
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:28,900
It's Klay!

337
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:32,471
Klay. Klay.

338
00:24:33,338 --> 00:24:35,140
Klay, lower your voice.

339
00:24:35,207 --> 00:24:36,741
Sir Ibarra might be around here.

340
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:38,410
I'm shouting so that he can hear us.

341
00:24:39,044 --> 00:24:40,345
Sir Ibarra!

342
00:24:40,412 --> 00:24:41,546
Klay, stop.

343
00:24:41,613 --> 00:24:43,715
Someone else might hear us.

344
00:24:49,621 --> 00:24:51,423
I want to disappear.

345
00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:53,758
I just want to scream!

346
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:55,026
Klay?

347
00:24:55,093 --> 00:24:56,228
Klay, come on.

348
00:24:57,429 --> 00:25:00,198
Klay, you heard
what Lucia said, didn't you?

349
00:25:01,533 --> 00:25:04,002
You believe that he's gone?

350
00:25:04,069 --> 00:25:06,471
I don't want to believe it.

351
00:25:06,538 --> 00:25:09,508
But what else can we do
that will not bring us to further danger?

352
00:25:10,575 --> 00:25:13,078
I also want to find my friend,

353
00:25:13,144 --> 00:25:14,679
but not right now.

354
00:25:14,746 --> 00:25:15,847
Then when?

355
00:25:15,914 --> 00:25:18,049
We're running out of time, Fidel!

356
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:23,421
Klay, where are you going?

357
00:25:23,488 --> 00:25:25,757
I'm going to look for Ibarra.

358
00:25:26,324 --> 00:25:27,492
Wait.

359
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:28,760
We can't go there.

360
00:25:28,827 --> 00:25:30,328
I'll go with you.

361
00:25:30,395 --> 00:25:32,130
We need to…

362
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:33,632
find weapons.

363
00:25:34,266 --> 00:25:35,800
Wait here, I'll get one.

364
00:25:36,935 --> 00:25:38,270
Just stay there.

365
00:25:44,609 --> 00:25:45,810
Klay?

366
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:47,245
Where did she go?

367
00:25:47,312 --> 00:25:48,313
Klay.

368
00:25:49,481 --> 00:25:50,682
Klay?

369
00:25:53,084 --> 00:25:53,952
Klay.

370
00:25:58,557 --> 00:25:59,824
Where did she go?

371
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:06,765
And what are you going to do?

372
00:26:08,867 --> 00:26:12,137
Live a life of despair?

373
00:26:13,438 --> 00:26:15,774
Just like what your mother did?

374
00:26:18,944 --> 00:26:21,279
Don't drag my mother into this!

375
00:26:27,319 --> 00:26:28,687
Don't tell me what to do.

376
00:26:29,521 --> 00:26:33,058
You have no right to meddle
in my life anymore.

377
00:26:33,692 --> 00:26:35,560
No right?

378
00:26:35,627 --> 00:26:38,663
But I am your father!

379
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:40,065
I'm your father!

380
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:42,934
Father?

381
00:26:45,036 --> 00:26:47,739
I will never consider you my father.

382
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:59,818
Because you are the devil

383
00:26:59,884 --> 00:27:02,153
who raped my mother.

384
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:11,630
Because even while I was still
being formed in my mother's womb.

385
00:27:16,568 --> 00:27:18,637
I was already condemned…

386
00:27:22,007 --> 00:27:27,712
to live a life full of lies and shame.

387
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:35,387
I was raised to live…

388
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:44,596
and to hold out hope
for a good life again and again.

389
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:52,170
But I never had the ability
to decide for myself

390
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:55,206
because you always,

391
00:27:55,273 --> 00:27:57,542
always tell me what to do.

392
00:28:03,048 --> 00:28:05,717
I will not get married
to the person you want for me.

393
00:28:11,156 --> 00:28:12,023
Instead,

394
00:28:14,993 --> 00:28:16,661
I will enter the convent.

395
00:28:19,564 --> 00:28:21,066
Don't say that, my child.

396
00:28:22,333 --> 00:28:24,602
My child, you don't know

397
00:28:24,669 --> 00:28:28,039
the loneliness and suffering
that you will experience

398
00:28:28,106 --> 00:28:30,275
when you enter the convent.

399
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:39,250
I have made my decision, Father.

400
00:28:42,487 --> 00:28:43,521
Convent

401
00:28:47,158 --> 00:28:48,326
or death?

402
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:01,506
Enough!

403
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:03,575
Do not joke about this.

404
00:29:05,343 --> 00:29:07,479
I'm not joking, Father.

405
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:18,757
Listen to me, Maria.

406
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:23,328
I will not be able to look after you
inside the convent.

407
00:29:24,562 --> 00:29:26,498
Someone like you

408
00:29:27,699 --> 00:29:31,569
will only suffer more
if you enter the convent

409
00:29:31,636 --> 00:29:33,505
instead of getting married.

410
00:29:35,206 --> 00:29:36,841
I don't deserve to be happy!

411
00:29:38,743 --> 00:29:41,279
We all deserve to suffer!

412
00:29:45,083 --> 00:29:50,255
That is why I can only choose
between convent or death.

413
00:30:05,436 --> 00:30:06,571
Maria.

414
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:10,341
Forgive me, Maria.

415
00:30:11,743 --> 00:30:15,046
I ask for your forgiveness
and also for your mother's forgiveness.

416
00:30:17,115 --> 00:30:19,250
Believe it or not,

417
00:30:20,018 --> 00:30:22,453
I loved Pia.

418
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:25,990
I loved her despite knowing
that doing so is a mortal sin.

419
00:30:30,528 --> 00:30:34,132
But how can I regret
the atrocity that I did

420
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:37,368
when it resulted in having
a daughter like you?

421
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:41,940
Someone who I loved more than my own life.

422
00:30:49,314 --> 00:30:50,348
Maria.

423
00:30:51,983 --> 00:30:54,252
You are my happiness.

424
00:30:54,919 --> 00:30:56,321
I'm begging you.

425
00:30:56,387 --> 00:30:58,890
Do not punish me like this.

426
00:31:00,625 --> 00:31:04,162
Do not punish me by throwing
your life away, my child.

427
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:06,664
Don't.

428
00:31:07,232 --> 00:31:08,066
Don't!

429
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:16,074
My life and fate
are now in my hands, Father.

430
00:31:17,742 --> 00:31:20,445
I am going to enter the convent.

431
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:26,117
And if you will try to stop me.

432
00:31:27,619 --> 00:31:29,454
I will take my own life.

433
00:31:45,703 --> 00:31:47,772
This conversation is over.

434
00:31:51,142 --> 00:31:52,911
May the Lord bless us,

435
00:31:56,347 --> 00:31:57,348
Your Reverence.

436
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:06,357
Clarita,

437
00:32:07,058 --> 00:32:08,993
were you and your godfather able to talk?

438
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:11,195
He went straight here from Manila.

439
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:15,800
I am going to see Auntie Isabel and Etta.

440
00:32:15,867 --> 00:32:18,303
I will ask for their help
to pack my things.

441
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:20,872
Are we going home to Manila?

442
00:32:21,906 --> 00:32:23,441
I am going home to the convent.

443
00:32:37,689 --> 00:32:39,724
Lord, my God.

444
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:44,529
Do not let me lose my child.

445
00:32:46,397 --> 00:32:49,767
Don't take her away from me, please.

446
00:32:50,868 --> 00:32:52,303
I beg of you.

447
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:14,759
Clarita.

448
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:18,896
Do you need to be at the convent
in Manila by tomorrow?

449
00:33:18,963 --> 00:33:21,599
Why don't we wait for your father first?

450
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:25,737
He went out to seek help
regarding your decision.

451
00:33:25,803 --> 00:33:28,172
I can't bear to stay here
any longer, Auntie.

452
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:32,577
Every second that I spend in this house

453
00:33:34,312 --> 00:33:37,248
only reminds me of the painful memories.

454
00:33:39,717 --> 00:33:41,586
I am just going to die
if I stay in this house.

455
00:33:41,652 --> 00:33:43,654
If that's what you want,

456
00:33:43,721 --> 00:33:45,990
I will have the carriage ready.

457
00:33:46,057 --> 00:33:49,093
Etta, help her pack.

458
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,762
Give her what she wants.

459
00:34:06,277 --> 00:34:07,745
Sir Ibarra!

460
00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:10,348
Sir Ibarra!

461
00:34:11,916 --> 00:34:13,551
Sir Ibarra!

462
00:34:21,826 --> 00:34:22,960
No.

463
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:26,697
It shouldn't end like this.

464
00:34:26,764 --> 00:34:29,067
It shouldn't end like this.

465
00:34:42,513 --> 00:34:45,049
You're Crisostomo Ibarra?

466
00:34:46,117 --> 00:34:47,185
Yes, I am.

467
00:35:00,965 --> 00:35:04,235
<i>-Pastry no one wants to buy
-Pastry no one wants to buy</i>

468
00:35:05,736 --> 00:35:09,173
<i>-Has mold on the side
-Has mold on the side</i>

469
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:31,596
I don't think it is right to talk
to a woman that way.

470
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:36,367
Especially since she is just
stating her opinion.

471
00:35:37,435 --> 00:35:40,271
And since you have become my friend now,

472
00:35:40,338 --> 00:35:45,276
I want nothing but your safety
and well-being.

473
00:35:45,343 --> 00:35:50,348
How come your perspective
in life has changed?

474
00:35:50,414 --> 00:35:53,217
Because I don't want you to get in danger.

475
00:35:54,552 --> 00:35:56,554
I don't want you to die.

476
00:36:10,434 --> 00:36:11,602
Sir Ibarra…

477
00:36:15,239 --> 00:36:17,208
Sir Ibarra, are you still alive?

478
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:25,216
If you're still alive, give me a sign.

479
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:28,286
Please give me a sign.

480
00:36:40,231 --> 00:36:41,232
Sir Ibarra?

481
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:46,237
Sir Ibarra?

482
00:36:50,241 --> 00:36:53,911
But my daughter can't enter
the convent, beloved Curate.

483
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:57,782
She can't become a nun

484
00:36:58,382 --> 00:37:00,651
because we will never see
each other again.

485
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:02,220
Please talk to her.

486
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:05,556
Maybe you can change her mind.

487
00:37:06,824 --> 00:37:09,427
She no longer talks to her godfather.

488
00:37:12,263 --> 00:37:16,100
She no longer listens to her godfather?

489
00:37:18,169 --> 00:37:21,105
I can't bear to be apart from my child.

490
00:37:22,573 --> 00:37:23,608
Your child.

491
00:37:25,109 --> 00:37:30,248
Captain Tiago, you know
that Maria is angry at me now.

492
00:37:30,848 --> 00:37:34,585
It seems like she's been angry
about many things recently.

493
00:37:34,652 --> 00:37:38,322
Perhaps she needs to be
closer to God again.

494
00:37:39,490 --> 00:37:41,525
Captain Tiago, may I ask?

495
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:42,994
Hold on, Curate.

496
00:37:44,562 --> 00:37:45,830
Do you agree with this?

497
00:37:46,564 --> 00:37:47,965
But why not?

498
00:37:48,032 --> 00:37:50,301
If that is her decision.

499
00:37:50,368 --> 00:37:53,904
Perhaps the convent will save her

500
00:37:53,971 --> 00:37:57,241
and will keep her away from bad people.

501
00:37:57,308 --> 00:37:59,710
And make her closer again

502
00:38:00,778 --> 00:38:01,712
to God.

503
00:38:03,848 --> 00:38:05,049
Oh, Holy Mary.

504
00:38:06,517 --> 00:38:09,353
Can't I really expect
any help here, Curate?

505
00:38:10,988 --> 00:38:12,189
It seems like

506
00:38:13,157 --> 00:38:15,226
you also want my daughter to suffer

507
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:19,363
and be apart from the people who love her.

508
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:22,400
I love poor Maria.

509
00:38:24,168 --> 00:38:27,571
If so, then why would you allow this
to happen to her?

510
00:38:28,339 --> 00:38:32,610
And why does it seem like
she suddenly hates you?

511
00:38:33,177 --> 00:38:34,779
And she's also blaming you.

512
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:39,984
You may leave now, Captain Tiago. Please.

513
00:38:41,385 --> 00:38:45,489
Are you agreeing with her decision
to enter the convent

514
00:38:45,556 --> 00:38:46,757
because she is angry at you?

515
00:38:47,558 --> 00:38:50,828
You should speak to her godfather
and not me.

516
00:38:51,395 --> 00:38:53,831
And I also know
that she cannot hide her anger

517
00:38:53,898 --> 00:38:54,865
toward her godfather.

518
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:57,768
Why is that?

519
00:39:02,273 --> 00:39:03,641
What do you know about it?

520
00:39:07,611 --> 00:39:09,013
Sir Ibarra?

521
00:39:14,318 --> 00:39:15,219
Mr. Torres?

522
00:39:16,954 --> 00:39:17,922
Ms. Infantes.

523
00:39:17,988 --> 00:39:19,357
Mr. Torres…

524
00:39:23,561 --> 00:39:26,397
Mr. Torres, do you know
where Ibarra really is?

525
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:29,867
Please tell me. Is he still alive?

526
00:39:34,038 --> 00:39:35,339
He will come back, right?

527
00:39:35,406 --> 00:39:36,540
I know he'll come back

528
00:39:36,607 --> 00:39:39,009
because there is a sequel,
the <i>El Fili,</i> right?

529
00:39:39,076 --> 00:39:41,445
So he cannot die, right?

530
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:47,084
I am just a messenger
of the truth, Captain Tiago.

531
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:49,520
And that is all.

532
00:39:50,087 --> 00:39:51,989
What truth?

533
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:54,592
I don't understand.

534
00:40:00,464 --> 00:40:02,400
What is funny about that, Father?

535
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:06,904
There's still a lot
you don't know, Captain Tiago.

536
00:40:06,971 --> 00:40:11,675
Things that most people
already know, but not you.

537
00:40:12,276 --> 00:40:14,311
Poor Santiago.

538
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:18,082
Know?

539
00:40:18,149 --> 00:40:19,784
About what?

540
00:40:22,486 --> 00:40:24,655
About many things.

541
00:40:24,722 --> 00:40:26,557
About the source of anger

542
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:29,727
of the child you consider your daughter.

543
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:33,898
It is about her deceased mother.

544
00:40:35,499 --> 00:40:40,104
What does my wife, Pia,
have to do with it?

545
00:40:42,206 --> 00:40:43,574
Didn't you

546
00:40:44,909 --> 00:40:47,545
hear any rumors?

547
00:40:50,147 --> 00:40:51,615
Haven't you read anything?

548
00:40:51,682 --> 00:40:54,251
What are you talking about, Curate?

549
00:40:56,587 --> 00:40:58,389
Thank you, Lord,

550
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:04,295
for giving me the ability
to enlighten you.

551
00:41:05,429 --> 00:41:09,433
Captain Tiago, they have been
making you a fool for so long.

552
00:41:11,502 --> 00:41:14,004
You have been deceived for so long.

553
00:41:14,972 --> 00:41:16,307
And here you are now.

554
00:41:17,074 --> 00:41:18,275
Clueless.

555
00:41:19,844 --> 00:41:24,648
Father, why don't you just tell me
about my wife and daughter?

556
00:41:25,282 --> 00:41:26,417
Captain Tiago,

557
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:32,223
you are not Maria's real father.

558
00:41:38,629 --> 00:41:39,763
What did you say?

559
00:41:41,866 --> 00:41:45,402
It's your dear friend, Father Damaso.

560
00:41:47,238 --> 00:41:48,672
He is Maria's real father.

561
00:41:55,312 --> 00:41:59,316
Perhaps you think I will not
know the truth!

562
00:41:59,383 --> 00:42:03,888
Santiago, do you know
the punishment for lying?

563
00:42:03,954 --> 00:42:04,889
And you, Father,

564
00:42:04,955 --> 00:42:07,324
should be the one making
the decision for me.

565
00:42:08,792 --> 00:42:12,162
What is your decision on this matter?

566
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:17,101
My apologies, Father,
I don't want to embarrass you,

567
00:42:18,235 --> 00:42:20,871
but what gives you the right
to impose your will on Maria

568
00:42:20,938 --> 00:42:22,606
as if you are her father

569
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:25,576
when her real father is right here?

570
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:30,347
Do not let me lose my child.

571
00:42:32,316 --> 00:42:35,653
Don't take her away from me, please.

572
00:43:10,187 --> 00:43:12,590
Perhaps what you know is wrong.

573
00:43:16,293 --> 00:43:18,195
So, is he really dead?

574
00:43:21,031 --> 00:43:22,666
You raised my hopes up.

575
00:43:22,733 --> 00:43:24,935
You said I was able to change the story.

576
00:43:25,002 --> 00:43:27,237
But what is this? What's happening?

577
00:43:27,304 --> 00:43:28,272
Back then,

578
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:30,741
you also gave me false hopes.

579
00:43:31,575 --> 00:43:34,445
I thought that you were able
to change the story.

580
00:43:38,482 --> 00:43:42,453
The end and the conclusion
are still the same.

581
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:44,622
Why is that, sir?

582
00:43:46,123 --> 00:43:47,825
Was Rizal serious?

583
00:43:49,026 --> 00:43:52,930
If you only read Noli,
then you would know.

584
00:43:55,332 --> 00:43:58,569
He killed the characters one by one.

585
00:43:59,870 --> 00:44:01,805
He almost wiped them all out.

586
00:44:07,177 --> 00:44:09,480
I can't leave the woman.

587
00:44:09,546 --> 00:44:10,481
Which woman?

588
00:44:10,547 --> 00:44:12,349
<i>Ms. Sisa.</i>

589
00:44:13,884 --> 00:44:15,352
Sisa…

590
00:44:15,419 --> 00:44:17,154
We discovered something dreadful.

591
00:44:17,221 --> 00:44:19,123
Two burnt bodies were found.

592
00:44:19,723 --> 00:44:22,059
We suspect that it might be
Sisa and Elias.

593
00:44:22,693 --> 00:44:25,496
What kind of novelist is Rizal?

594
00:44:26,130 --> 00:44:27,331
They were just a part

595
00:44:27,965 --> 00:44:30,067
of the grand narrative of the novel.

596
00:44:31,435 --> 00:44:35,839
They are not just actors
or mere characters in the story.

597
00:44:35,906 --> 00:44:38,175
They are real people.

598
00:44:40,277 --> 00:44:42,146
They have their own lives.

599
00:44:44,114 --> 00:44:45,382
They have feelings.

600
00:44:47,251 --> 00:44:48,719
Each of them have their own stories.

601
00:44:48,786 --> 00:44:50,621
They have dreams.

602
00:44:52,089 --> 00:44:53,924
And I became close to all of them.

603
00:44:53,991 --> 00:44:55,926
They became my friends.

604
00:44:57,261 --> 00:44:58,996
And I am glad

605
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:03,901
that these characters created
by Rizal became dear to you.

606
00:45:05,169 --> 00:45:10,307
I finally see that you are interested
in my class after all, Ms. Infantes.

607
00:45:12,109 --> 00:45:14,611
But don't forget this, Ms. Infantes.

608
00:45:16,113 --> 00:45:19,216
You are here to learn

609
00:45:20,751 --> 00:45:26,023
and for you to fully understand
the true meaning of the novel.

610
00:45:28,258 --> 00:45:29,259
Which is what?

611
00:45:35,399 --> 00:45:38,102
That all my loved ones will die too?

612
00:45:42,873 --> 00:45:44,675
That no matter what I do,

613
00:45:45,609 --> 00:45:49,012
it's not under my control to save them?

614
00:45:51,515 --> 00:45:53,951
Is that it, Mr. Torres?

615
00:45:55,519 --> 00:45:57,755
Is that what Rizal wants to say

616
00:45:59,056 --> 00:46:03,293
in his grand narrative that represents
Philippine society?

617
00:46:05,829 --> 00:46:09,333
That we, Filipinos, are hopeless,
and so is our unfortunate nation?

618
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:15,506
That no matter what we do,

619
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:19,977
we will all die eventually?

620
00:46:57,447 --> 00:46:58,849
What do you need from me?

621
00:46:58,916 --> 00:47:00,150
COMING UP…

622
00:47:00,217 --> 00:47:02,986
What is this disrespect?

623
00:47:03,053 --> 00:47:05,889
Be thankful that's the only thing
I did to you.

624
00:47:05,956 --> 00:47:10,661
Come to think of it,
it is much better if I just kill you!

625
00:47:10,727 --> 00:47:11,762
Klay.

626
00:47:14,264 --> 00:47:15,098
Klay.

627
00:47:15,866 --> 00:47:18,735
<i>How is your search for our friend going?</i>

628
00:47:18,802 --> 00:47:20,070
I found someone else.

629
00:47:20,137 --> 00:47:22,506
I know you were talking
to someone earlier.

630
00:47:22,573 --> 00:47:23,574
Did you see him?

631
00:47:24,141 --> 00:47:25,475
<i>Mr. Torres.</i>

632
00:47:30,881 --> 00:47:33,217
