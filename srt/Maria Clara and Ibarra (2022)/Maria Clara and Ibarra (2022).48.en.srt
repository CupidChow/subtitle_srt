00:00:31,264 --> 00:00:33,800
MARIA CLARA AND IBARRA

2
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:38,371
THIS PROGRAM, WHICH IS ADAPTED
FROM THE NOVELS OF DR. JOSE P. RIZAL,

3
00:00:38,438 --> 00:00:43,376
IS PRESENTED USING DRAMATIC ELEMENTS
TO CONNECT THE PRESENT AND THE PAST

4
00:00:43,443 --> 00:00:46,379
IN A SPECIAL REIMAGINING OF THE NATIONAL
LITERATURE FILIPINOS ARE PROUD OF.

5
00:00:46,446 --> 00:00:51,251
<i>Why do you have to bring me food
as if I were sick or a prisoner?</i>

6
00:00:51,317 --> 00:00:54,888
<i>I'm only making sure
that you are safe from danger.</i>

7
00:00:54,954 --> 00:00:56,956
Open the door, please!

8
00:00:57,023 --> 00:00:59,325
Help me, please…

9
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:02,896
<i>Do we really need
such tight security in our monastery?</i>

10
00:01:02,962 --> 00:01:05,432
I am very worried about Maria, Father.

11
00:01:05,498 --> 00:01:08,234
Why is her room
the only one that's locked?

12
00:01:08,301 --> 00:01:11,571
Are you questioning my orders, sister?

13
00:01:11,638 --> 00:01:13,406
No, father. Forgive me.

14
00:01:13,973 --> 00:01:16,910
<i>A mysterious book
that is like a wheel of fortune.</i>

15
00:01:16,976 --> 00:01:21,581
It's such a mystery,
that we are just characters in a novel.

16
00:01:21,648 --> 00:01:23,049
<i>You can stop pretending.</i>

17
00:01:23,116 --> 00:01:24,317
<i>I know you, miss.</i>

18
00:01:24,384 --> 00:01:25,518
You are Ms. Klay.

19
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:27,754
Sister Maria has been waiting for you.

20
00:01:27,821 --> 00:01:28,922
I will help you.

21
00:01:28,988 --> 00:01:31,257
<i>I just want to remind you, father,</i>

22
00:01:31,324 --> 00:01:33,093
<i>I hate you to the depths of my soul.</i>

23
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:35,361
<i>I despise you.</i>

24
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:38,431
And who is it that you do not despise?

25
00:01:38,498 --> 00:01:39,899
The man that you love,

26
00:01:39,966 --> 00:01:41,101
Crisostomo Ibarra?

27
00:01:41,668 --> 00:01:45,405
Because Crisostomo is the only one
who makes my heart beat.

28
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:48,675
<i>Because he's the only one
who gives me a reason</i>

29
00:01:49,175 --> 00:01:50,743
<i>to live!</i>

30
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:52,512
<i>And because he will come back for me!</i>

31
00:01:52,579 --> 00:01:53,513
PREVIOUSLY

32
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:01,054
Maria!

33
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:02,722
-Father, what have you done?
-You animal!

34
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:03,823
You animal!

35
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:04,791
You animal!

36
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:06,793
Go on!

37
00:02:07,694 --> 00:02:08,561
Go on.

38
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:09,963
If you don't stop,

39
00:02:10,763 --> 00:02:15,101
this witch's life

40
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:16,870
will come to an end.

41
00:02:17,937 --> 00:02:19,205
Good thing you have arrived.

42
00:02:19,272 --> 00:02:20,740
Arrest these women.

43
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:22,408
We are arresting you, father.

44
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:24,144
Let's go, father. Prepare for your…

45
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:25,044
Let me go!

46
00:02:25,111 --> 00:02:26,546
Thank you for coming back.

47
00:02:26,613 --> 00:02:28,214
I told you, right?

48
00:02:28,281 --> 00:02:30,283
I will never forget about you.

49
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:31,885
I came back

50
00:02:31,951 --> 00:02:33,586
to change the story.

51
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:36,823
Especially your happy ending with Sir.

52
00:02:44,631 --> 00:02:46,032
I've come back…

53
00:02:47,133 --> 00:02:48,168
my love.

54
00:02:56,442 --> 00:02:57,710
Crisostomo?

55
00:03:52,632 --> 00:03:54,567
It seems like I'm already in heaven…

56
00:03:56,469 --> 00:03:58,605
for you are here with me again.

57
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:04,277
Let's thank Ms. Klay…

58
00:04:05,845 --> 00:04:08,748
who persuaded me to save you at once.

59
00:04:20,727 --> 00:04:23,730
You are all just characters in a story,

60
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:25,431
in a novel.

61
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:34,374
Aren't you planning
to at least take a peek?

62
00:04:49,656 --> 00:04:51,424
I wonder what else
is written in that book…

63
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:54,694
that is yet to happen.

64
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,574
-Let go of me!
-Father!

65
00:05:41,641 --> 00:05:43,476
Let go of me, you scoundrels!

66
00:05:54,987 --> 00:05:56,155
I'm so happy.

67
00:05:58,224 --> 00:05:59,559
You're finally reunited.

68
00:06:01,794 --> 00:06:03,963
We saved Maria, sir.

69
00:06:06,999 --> 00:06:09,602
But I'm sorry to say
that we need to go now.

70
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:18,444
Ibarra.

71
00:06:21,781 --> 00:06:22,882
Maria!

72
00:06:25,785 --> 00:06:26,886
Maria?

73
00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:32,425
Maria!

74
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:34,460
Maria!

75
00:06:39,031 --> 00:06:40,533
Maria, I didn't mean to.

76
00:06:42,535 --> 00:06:44,036
Maria, I didn't mean to.

77
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:47,073
Maria…

78
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:49,409
Maria!

79
00:06:49,475 --> 00:06:51,110
Maria.

80
00:06:51,177 --> 00:06:53,279
No.

81
00:06:53,346 --> 00:06:55,415
Maria…

82
00:06:59,485 --> 00:07:00,353
Maria…

83
00:07:02,054 --> 00:07:03,122
Maria, my love.

84
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:06,392
Maria, why did you do that?

85
00:07:06,893 --> 00:07:08,094
Why did you do that?

86
00:07:10,363 --> 00:07:11,831
We need to take her to the hospital.

87
00:07:13,566 --> 00:07:16,202
She will lose so much blood.

88
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:17,203
We need to--

89
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,439
we need to apply pressure.

90
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:24,977
Maria…

91
00:07:29,248 --> 00:07:30,349
My namesake…

92
00:07:32,652 --> 00:07:34,153
I am still thankful…

93
00:07:37,156 --> 00:07:41,160
that I saw you and Crisostomo again

94
00:07:41,928 --> 00:07:43,596
before I die.

95
00:07:43,663 --> 00:07:45,097
No.

96
00:07:45,164 --> 00:07:46,466
Maria,

97
00:07:46,532 --> 00:07:48,935
open your eyes.
Look at me. You will not die.

98
00:07:49,001 --> 00:07:50,536
You will not die.

99
00:07:50,603 --> 00:07:51,971
We are already changing the story.

100
00:07:52,038 --> 00:07:53,673
Look! We're here now!

101
00:07:53,739 --> 00:07:55,475
This was not written in the book!

102
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:57,076
We can still change this.

103
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:58,211
Please, keep fighting.

104
00:07:58,277 --> 00:07:59,245
Keep fighting.

105
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:11,824
Maria!

106
00:08:13,226 --> 00:08:14,527
It's a story…

107
00:08:16,128 --> 00:08:17,396
A…

108
00:08:17,463 --> 00:08:18,564
A story…

109
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,702
A story of love…

110
00:08:28,741 --> 00:08:30,243
that…

111
00:08:30,309 --> 00:08:31,644
that the ending is…

112
00:08:33,713 --> 00:08:38,117
that my most beloved and I
get to see each other again.

113
00:08:47,059 --> 00:08:48,060
A story…

114
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:52,398
where we are…

115
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:56,836
the heroes.

116
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:02,642
Right, Klay?

117
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:04,410
Yes!

118
00:09:04,477 --> 00:09:06,512
You and Sir Ibarra.

119
00:09:06,579 --> 00:09:08,180
You are both heroes.

120
00:09:08,247 --> 00:09:11,350
There are many of you.
Those in this town who have a good heart

121
00:09:11,417 --> 00:09:13,586
are heroes of their own stories.

122
00:09:13,653 --> 00:09:15,054
You're right.

123
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:48,554
How were you able to predict all of this?

124
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:59,432
Tell me…

125
00:10:01,233 --> 00:10:03,202
how this story will end…

126
00:10:04,904 --> 00:10:07,773
once I am gone.

127
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:26,859
You will go to another world.

128
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:31,564
In such a beautiful world.

129
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:37,069
In a world where there is
unending freedom.

130
00:10:38,504 --> 00:10:41,207
Where you will be free
to walk across the clouds…

131
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:45,177
bask in the warm rays of the sun…

132
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:49,081
and play with the blowing wind.

133
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:57,690
You will be free to do
and say whatever you want.

134
00:10:59,525 --> 00:11:03,195
There, you will feel
everlasting happiness.

135
00:11:05,931 --> 00:11:08,100
You will no longer suffer.

136
00:11:10,536 --> 00:11:12,371
You will not be hurt anymore.

137
00:11:15,941 --> 00:11:17,877
You will finally be free.

138
00:11:36,062 --> 00:11:38,264
Sweet are the hours…

139
00:11:39,932 --> 00:11:41,500
in one's native land.

140
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,141
Where all is dear…

141
00:11:52,244 --> 00:11:54,146
the sunbeams bless.

142
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:58,951
The breeze…

143
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:02,054
with its life-giving…

144
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:10,463
fragrance.

145
00:12:15,835 --> 00:12:18,070
Death

146
00:12:18,137 --> 00:12:19,605
is bliss.

147
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:23,943
Love…

148
00:12:25,711 --> 00:12:27,179
is sacred.

149
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:56,342
Maria?

150
00:13:05,551 --> 00:13:08,287
Maria!

151
00:13:11,857 --> 00:13:16,996
Maria…

152
00:14:22,494 --> 00:14:24,530
-You animal!
-Don't do this.

153
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:34,540
It came true…

154
00:14:38,277 --> 00:14:42,314
What was written in the book came true.

155
00:14:47,786 --> 00:14:49,421
Maria died.

156
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:54,960
Maria died.

157
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,269
You're next.

158
00:15:05,971 --> 00:15:08,674
You're next, Ibarra.

159
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:19,418
Is this also written in the book, father?

160
00:15:29,528 --> 00:15:30,562
If so…

161
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:37,970
we will see each other in hell.

162
00:15:41,206 --> 00:15:43,008
Son of the devil--

163
00:15:49,248 --> 00:15:51,283
-My friend!
-My friend! That's enough!

164
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:53,485
-Stop!
-It's dangerous here.

165
00:15:53,552 --> 00:15:54,954
-Let's go.
-He's dead. Let's go!

166
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:57,890
Sir, I will have Hernando clean that up.

167
00:18:00,045 --> 00:18:01,780
Love will find a way.

168
00:18:04,216 --> 00:18:06,318
I love you very much.

169
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:29,641
I also love you very much,

170
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:31,076
Maria Clara.

171
00:20:55,287 --> 00:20:58,757
I will hold on to our oath forever.

172
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:03,962
I will come back for you, Maria.

173
00:21:08,133 --> 00:21:09,968
Can you wait for me again?

174
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:16,108
Even if it takes seven more years,
many times over…

175
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,148
I will wait for you, Crisostomo.

176
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:28,787
<i>Take my love with you.</i>

177
00:21:30,088 --> 00:21:32,024
<i>Give me time, Maria Clara.</i>

178
00:21:33,925 --> 00:21:35,827
<i>Let me regain my strength…</i>

179
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:39,631
<i>so I can save you.</i>

180
00:21:41,033 --> 00:21:43,101
<i>And we can make the life</i>
<i>we dream of come true.</i>

181
00:21:44,369 --> 00:21:46,471
<i>Together, living peacefully.</i>

182
00:24:04,509 --> 00:24:06,478
Let's just regain our strength.

183
00:24:07,746 --> 00:24:11,450
We will return to Laguna at dawn.

184
00:24:14,052 --> 00:24:15,720
Hernando…

185
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:16,788
Thank you.

186
00:24:19,591 --> 00:24:22,260
I'm sure this is not written
in the original version.

187
00:24:23,628 --> 00:24:24,663
Pardon?

188
00:24:26,698 --> 00:24:27,732
Done.

189
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:31,136
Good thing I brought this.

190
00:24:33,405 --> 00:24:35,807
But next time,
we will use my feminine napkin

191
00:24:35,874 --> 00:24:37,342
when the gauze runs out.

192
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:41,179
Miss…

193
00:24:42,514 --> 00:24:43,448
How come…

194
00:24:43,515 --> 00:24:45,317
how come this doesn't dry up?

195
00:24:45,383 --> 00:24:46,351
And…

196
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:48,353
and the smell…

197
00:24:51,857 --> 00:24:53,124
It's bamboo-scented.

198
00:24:56,261 --> 00:24:57,562
It smells like bamboo.

199
00:24:58,697 --> 00:25:01,433
It's also anti-bacterial.

200
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,835
It removes…

201
00:25:05,737 --> 00:25:06,738
Itch mite.

202
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:09,975
Just like germs.

203
00:25:10,041 --> 00:25:13,812
Whatever it is,
this mysterious wipe cloth brings relief.

204
00:25:19,618 --> 00:25:20,619
Miss…

205
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:23,788
did you give the gentleman one of those?

206
00:25:25,557 --> 00:25:27,559
So he can come to his senses.

207
00:25:32,097 --> 00:25:33,498
That is not what he needs.

208
00:25:35,667 --> 00:25:37,636
He hasn't eaten all day.

209
00:25:54,419 --> 00:25:55,954
Sir, you might be hungry.

210
00:25:58,823 --> 00:26:00,392
I'm not hungry.

211
00:26:07,632 --> 00:26:08,900
Hey,

212
00:26:08,967 --> 00:26:10,468
my friend,

213
00:26:10,535 --> 00:26:11,803
where are you going?

214
00:26:13,672 --> 00:26:18,276
Staying here is not part of my plan.

215
00:26:23,515 --> 00:26:24,616
Crisostomo!

216
00:26:26,551 --> 00:26:28,219
Simoun!

217
00:26:28,286 --> 00:26:30,922
Whatever it is that you're planning,

218
00:26:30,989 --> 00:26:32,924
let us help you.

219
00:26:33,959 --> 00:26:35,894
You don't need to do this alone.

220
00:26:36,828 --> 00:26:39,397
We will just drag each other down!

221
00:26:40,165 --> 00:26:41,600
One more thing,

222
00:26:41,666 --> 00:26:45,870
the foolishness I regret
letting happen is over.

223
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:57,949
You talk

224
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:01,019
as if we were not friends before.

225
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:04,189
So much has changed, my friend.

226
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:10,762
The man you knew then
does not exist anymore.

227
00:27:11,896 --> 00:27:13,331
Ibarra is dead.

228
00:27:14,599 --> 00:27:16,434
He has been dead for a long time.

229
00:27:17,869 --> 00:27:19,738
So why do you keep bringing him back?

230
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:22,474
To kill him again?

231
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:26,044
Allow us to at least help you.

232
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:28,480
To help?

233
00:27:30,348 --> 00:27:32,283
Do you wish to give me some sort of aid?

234
00:27:34,519 --> 00:27:35,387
Well then,

235
00:27:36,121 --> 00:27:37,789
Miss and Mister…

236
00:27:39,424 --> 00:27:41,493
help me change all of these.

237
00:27:42,694 --> 00:27:45,096
Because change is what I am after.

238
00:27:46,431 --> 00:27:48,133
For this country to revolt!

239
00:27:50,535 --> 00:27:51,603
Revolution.

240
00:27:53,304 --> 00:27:55,740
We can be allies, then.

241
00:27:57,409 --> 00:27:58,843
But what is your plan?

242
00:28:00,412 --> 00:28:03,014
I am using my power right now

243
00:28:03,081 --> 00:28:05,717
to urge the conquerors…

244
00:28:06,718 --> 00:28:09,521
to oppress you, the Indios more.

245
00:28:10,755 --> 00:28:14,859
And if you oblige me, my friends,

246
00:28:14,926 --> 00:28:16,561
I will help spread…

247
00:28:19,798 --> 00:28:20,932
brutality…

248
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:23,234
theft…

249
00:28:25,003 --> 00:28:28,073
and death to our
white oppressors and civil guards

250
00:28:28,139 --> 00:28:32,811
so you will know who the real enemies are.

251
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:35,113
Hold on.

252
00:28:36,314 --> 00:28:40,485
Haven't our countrymen
experienced this even then?

253
00:28:41,486 --> 00:28:44,622
And now it seems that you
want to make it worse?

254
00:28:50,595 --> 00:28:53,131
Isn't that what you've
always wanted, Elias?

255
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,135
Don't you understand?

256
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:01,139
To aggravate

257
00:29:01,206 --> 00:29:04,843
this putrid outdated and rotten system.

258
00:29:06,778 --> 00:29:09,948
To further enrage people.

259
00:29:11,816 --> 00:29:12,717
For hate to grow…

260
00:29:13,852 --> 00:29:17,188
and burst from the hearts of the Indios.

261
00:29:19,324 --> 00:29:22,560
And to take revenge on the people
who have long oppressed them!

262
00:29:23,361 --> 00:29:25,230
Until all of them

263
00:29:25,897 --> 00:29:28,166
revolt.

264
00:29:33,238 --> 00:29:36,407
Is that what you think needs to happen…

265
00:29:37,742 --> 00:29:41,045
for our country's revolution to succeed?

266
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:43,214
Is that it, my friend?

267
00:29:45,183 --> 00:29:47,352
Are you working for the corporation now?

268
00:29:49,053 --> 00:29:52,757
Do you wish for innocent people to suffer?

269
00:29:52,824 --> 00:29:54,325
I do not favor anyone!

270
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:57,162
This is the only thing I could think of

271
00:29:57,729 --> 00:30:00,365
for there to be a true revolution!

272
00:30:01,399 --> 00:30:02,634
But didn't it cross your mind…

273
00:30:03,601 --> 00:30:08,506
that with your plans,
many people might be affected?

274
00:30:08,573 --> 00:30:11,743
The children, the elderly, men, and women!

275
00:30:13,278 --> 00:30:14,412
Is that what you want?

276
00:30:18,616 --> 00:30:19,517
Elias…

277
00:30:21,586 --> 00:30:25,156
isn't this what you've always wanted too?

278
00:30:27,959 --> 00:30:31,462
We both know what this country needs.

279
00:30:33,131 --> 00:30:35,133
We need radical change.

280
00:30:35,967 --> 00:30:37,735
We need weapons,

281
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:39,437
explosives,

282
00:30:40,271 --> 00:30:41,372
wealth…

283
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:45,376
connections to the poor,
the rich, and the powerful

284
00:30:45,443 --> 00:30:50,114
so we can form a new nation!

285
00:30:50,181 --> 00:30:54,485
The new Philippines!

286
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:01,526
It's true that we both want a revolution.

287
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:06,965
But the change that we want is contingent…

288
00:31:07,966 --> 00:31:12,403
to hope, honor, and freedom.

289
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:17,442
While yours is a result
of people's oppression,

290
00:31:17,508 --> 00:31:22,247
so they become desperate
and vengeful like you!

291
00:31:22,313 --> 00:31:24,182
Revolution is open to everyone!

292
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:31,122
I'm only goading them
so they rise and fight!

293
00:31:35,293 --> 00:31:36,127
Simoun…

294
00:31:37,195 --> 00:31:40,765
It's not a change
for the betterment of our country

295
00:31:40,832 --> 00:31:41,733
that you want.

296
00:31:43,034 --> 00:31:46,704
What you want is for
the subjugators to terrorize the country!

297
00:31:48,673 --> 00:31:50,875
Many innocent people will die!

298
00:31:50,942 --> 00:31:52,777
Then let there be death!

299
00:31:54,612 --> 00:31:59,517
All the while, I thought
you would be able to help me…

300
00:32:01,352 --> 00:32:03,087
my old friends.

301
00:32:06,824 --> 00:32:12,830
No matter what Simoun, we will never let
the oppressed suffer more

302
00:32:12,897 --> 00:32:16,000
just to get what we want.

303
00:32:16,567 --> 00:32:18,269
Friend or foe?

304
00:32:19,504 --> 00:32:21,773
I think I know now which one you all are.

305
00:32:27,979 --> 00:32:30,348
Loud and clear.

306
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:33,751
Goodbye,

307
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:36,120
old friends.

308
00:32:51,703 --> 00:32:53,304
Are you coming with me now, Ms. Klay?

309
00:32:56,874 --> 00:32:59,310
If so, there is nothing else
for us to talk about.

310
00:32:59,377 --> 00:33:00,912
Can you please listen to me first?

311
00:33:03,381 --> 00:33:04,282
Make it quick.

312
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:07,385
I understand.

313
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,855
I understand where you are coming from.

314
00:33:11,789 --> 00:33:14,459
Why do you need to do this?

315
00:33:16,461 --> 00:33:17,829
You've lost your father.

316
00:33:20,932 --> 00:33:22,934
And now, you've lost
the love of your life.

317
00:33:25,603 --> 00:33:29,774
Aside from that, they destroyed
your dream of building a school

318
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:33,211
as well as your plans
to make this country a better place.

319
00:33:34,078 --> 00:33:35,880
I understand all that.

320
00:33:38,049 --> 00:33:40,118
But I am begging you…

321
00:33:42,153 --> 00:33:44,088
do not push through with your plan.

322
00:33:44,922 --> 00:33:46,691
Because the ending won't be good!

323
00:33:46,758 --> 00:33:50,061
It is written in the book! I promise, sir!

324
00:34:03,608 --> 00:34:04,442
I know.

325
00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:10,114
But I feel that…

326
00:34:14,318 --> 00:34:16,020
you are still a good person.

327
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:22,460
You may change your appearance,
you may change your name,

328
00:34:22,527 --> 00:34:23,895
but you are still you…

329
00:34:27,498 --> 00:34:28,599
Sir Ibarra.

330
00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:35,139
You still have the heart to love others.

331
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:40,044
Choose to help and understand.

332
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:45,416
That is the Crisostomo Ibarra I knew.

333
00:34:48,019 --> 00:34:50,721
So do not let darkness prevail.

334
00:34:53,124 --> 00:34:57,295
And what did I get
from being kind back then?

335
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:04,335
What will you achieve
by being a bad person now?

336
00:35:07,305 --> 00:35:08,139
Evil

337
00:35:08,706 --> 00:35:10,074
against evil?

338
00:35:14,745 --> 00:35:15,746
Just think about it…

339
00:35:17,715 --> 00:35:20,218
If Maria Clara were still alive…

340
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,722
do you think she would be thrilled
with what you're doing?

341
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:29,927
Her heart will be crushed!

342
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:34,899
What's the sense of her death?

343
00:35:35,933 --> 00:35:38,903
Of taking the bullet for you
if you were only to turn out that way!

344
00:35:43,674 --> 00:35:45,543
So, I am begging you.

345
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:51,215
For Maria Clara's sake…

346
00:35:54,418 --> 00:35:56,854
for the sake of all our hardships,

347
00:35:56,921 --> 00:35:58,923
do not push through with your plan.

348
00:36:10,201 --> 00:36:14,272
But, our old friend still left us, right?

349
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:16,474
Ms. Klay,

350
00:36:17,375 --> 00:36:18,709
do you think

351
00:36:19,443 --> 00:36:20,344
he listened to you?

352
00:36:22,813 --> 00:36:23,848
Gosh, Fidel.

353
00:36:25,116 --> 00:36:28,019
I don't know if I convinced him
when we talked earlier.

354
00:36:30,087 --> 00:36:31,689
But I am still hoping

355
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:35,893
that the Ibarra
underneath the disguise listened to me.

356
00:36:37,228 --> 00:36:38,896
But as of now, I don't know.

357
00:36:39,897 --> 00:36:41,399
Let's just keep our faith, Fidel.

358
00:36:41,966 --> 00:36:43,167
All we can do now is trust.

359
00:36:44,402 --> 00:36:46,237
You really have not changed,

360
00:36:47,104 --> 00:36:48,339
Ms. Klay.

361
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:52,610
Prosecutor!

362
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:55,479
Prosecutor.

363
00:36:55,546 --> 00:36:56,414
What is it?

364
00:36:57,014 --> 00:36:58,683
The friar's body is missing.

365
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:03,187
Where would that Salvi go?

366
00:37:04,355 --> 00:37:05,656
I also don't know.

367
00:37:06,524 --> 00:37:09,126
We searched the whole place
but we did not find it.

368
00:37:11,262 --> 00:37:12,096
But this…

369
00:37:14,799 --> 00:37:17,134
I saw it in the clothes
that Simoun had left.

370
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:24,942
<i>Mane,</i>

371
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:28,045
<i>tekel, fares.</i>

372
00:37:30,314 --> 00:37:31,282
What language is this?

373
00:37:35,019 --> 00:37:37,221
I don't know what that means.

374
00:37:37,288 --> 00:37:39,390
But I think it's written in the…

375
00:37:49,867 --> 00:37:52,036
Simoun, not the lamp.

376
00:38:08,753 --> 00:38:11,489
Are you sure you saw the body here?

377
00:38:11,555 --> 00:38:12,423
Yes!

378
00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:15,559
I was supposed to go to
your house but I saw it here.

379
00:38:16,427 --> 00:38:17,361
There! There!

380
00:38:21,198 --> 00:38:22,433
My God!

381
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:23,868
Who would do such a thing?

382
00:38:25,836 --> 00:38:26,904
Remove the cover.

383
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:28,272
Who might that be?

384
00:38:28,339 --> 00:38:29,540
Maybe a bandit.

385
00:38:29,607 --> 00:38:31,309
But that person is wearing
a religious habit.

386
00:38:33,044 --> 00:38:34,679
That's Father Salvi!

387
00:38:35,713 --> 00:38:37,982
This makes me so mad!

388
00:38:38,049 --> 00:38:39,216
Such disrespect!

389
00:38:39,283 --> 00:38:41,519
Who did this? All of you, speak!

390
00:38:42,086 --> 00:38:44,021
Who killed a disciple of God?

391
00:38:45,056 --> 00:38:45,956
Captain General,

392
00:38:46,624 --> 00:38:47,892
there's a body!

393
00:38:49,927 --> 00:38:50,761
Señor!

394
00:38:56,033 --> 00:38:56,867
It's Simoun!

395
00:38:58,436 --> 00:38:59,337
Is he still alive?

396
00:38:59,403 --> 00:39:00,805
Yes, he is still breathing.

397
00:39:07,678 --> 00:39:08,846
"Death

398
00:39:09,747 --> 00:39:11,849
to the person who pretends
to be a disciple of God."

399
00:39:13,417 --> 00:39:16,520
"Life to the emissary of the colonizers,

400
00:39:16,587 --> 00:39:19,256
so they can be message bearers."

401
00:39:19,323 --> 00:39:21,726
What? What is the message?

402
00:39:21,792 --> 00:39:24,962
"There will be huge chaos."

403
00:39:25,763 --> 00:39:27,665
"We will wipe out…

404
00:39:29,133 --> 00:39:31,769
all the clerics…

405
00:39:32,803 --> 00:39:34,638
and the leaders of the government."

406
00:39:36,674 --> 00:39:37,775
My God.

407
00:39:39,176 --> 00:39:40,411
Those devils!

408
00:39:40,478 --> 00:39:42,613
Those heretics and filibusters!

409
00:39:43,481 --> 00:39:44,882
They will pay for this!

410
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:54,625
Take Don Simoun to the doctor.

411
00:39:54,692 --> 00:39:55,593
Please help me.

412
00:40:25,389 --> 00:40:26,590
We need to go.

413
00:40:26,657 --> 00:40:28,259
I will leave you in charge of the curate.

414
00:40:30,127 --> 00:40:32,096
He was the only advisor to the curate.

415
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:35,766
He's not been the curate of San Diego
for quite some time now.

416
00:40:38,502 --> 00:40:42,306
I also should have stopped serving him
as head sacristan a long time ago.

417
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:01,792
Thank you.

418
00:41:05,863 --> 00:41:08,165
Thank you, Your Reverence.

419
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:15,372
Thank you.

420
00:41:18,075 --> 00:41:20,044
Thank you for I am now free.

421
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,121
You said that it came from the Bible?

422
00:41:33,257 --> 00:41:34,525
From what I remember…

423
00:41:35,793 --> 00:41:37,294
this is from the Book of Daniel.

424
00:41:38,462 --> 00:41:39,597
In one of the stories in it…

425
00:41:40,798 --> 00:41:45,369
they found these words
written on the wall.

426
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:49,406
No one knew the meaning of these words…

427
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:52,009
except for the prophet Daniel.

428
00:41:55,246 --> 00:41:57,414
I didn't know you were proficient
with the Bible, Fidel.

429
00:41:58,415 --> 00:42:02,520
I have tried to forget,
that before I studied in Europe,

430
00:42:03,554 --> 00:42:05,756
my family sent me to study in a seminary

431
00:42:08,792 --> 00:42:12,296
in order to become a good creature of God.

432
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:16,267
Who has forsaken
the most impure of them all.

433
00:42:20,571 --> 00:42:21,772
But look at you…

434
00:42:23,474 --> 00:42:26,577
you are now a pure servant of our country.

435
00:42:35,819 --> 00:42:37,254
And a servant of love…

436
00:42:38,722 --> 00:42:39,623
Ms. Klay.

437
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:45,896
Pardon my intrusion,

438
00:42:46,764 --> 00:42:50,868
but what does <i>mene, tekel, and fares</i> mean?

439
00:42:52,036 --> 00:42:54,738
I have been trying to remember
what those words mean.

440
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:59,643
<i>Fares</i> means "a divided kingdom".

441
00:42:59,710 --> 00:43:03,380
<i>Tekel</i> means
"you were weighed but found wanting".

442
00:43:04,648 --> 00:43:09,987
And <i>mene</i> means "the days
of the king's reign are numbered".

443
00:43:12,089 --> 00:43:13,390
But…

444
00:43:15,125 --> 00:43:18,662
why would Simoun leave
us with those words?

445
00:43:19,997 --> 00:43:23,000
If these were lines in an action film…

446
00:43:25,636 --> 00:43:27,504
"Your days are numbered."

447
00:43:31,709 --> 00:43:33,777
Is that what Simoun wants to tell us?

448
00:43:34,645 --> 00:43:36,013
Is he scaring us?

449
00:43:37,514 --> 00:43:39,216
Are our days numbered?

450
00:43:49,193 --> 00:43:50,294
We need to be careful.

451
00:43:50,361 --> 00:43:53,130
The civil guards are now hunting us down.

452
00:43:53,197 --> 00:43:56,100
Everyone who has associations
with our group,

453
00:43:56,166 --> 00:43:59,670
those they call bandits or rebels.

454
00:43:59,737 --> 00:44:00,871
It is much too dangerous now.

455
00:44:03,207 --> 00:44:04,508
Why is that?

456
00:44:04,575 --> 00:44:06,010
By the order of the Captain General…

457
00:44:06,910 --> 00:44:09,747
because of the slander committed
by the Brown Cardinal,

458
00:44:10,247 --> 00:44:11,482
Simoun!

459
00:44:13,617 --> 00:44:15,085
Simoun…

460
00:44:27,164 --> 00:44:28,232
We are safe for now.

461
00:44:31,001 --> 00:44:34,972
What about the hut
I wanted you to look for in Tiani?

462
00:44:35,873 --> 00:44:37,341
Have you found it?

463
00:44:37,408 --> 00:44:38,742
Yes.

464
00:44:40,377 --> 00:44:42,780
He has also posted bail and gone home.

465
00:44:45,749 --> 00:44:47,351
You may rest now, Lingyun.

466
00:44:48,585 --> 00:44:49,620
Thank you very much.

467
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:50,521
Thank you.

468
00:44:54,024 --> 00:44:55,793
How unfortunate, Señor Simoun.

469
00:44:56,794 --> 00:44:59,263
Thank God you survived.

470
00:45:01,131 --> 00:45:04,601
It seems like the Lord
has blessed me, Your Reverence.

471
00:45:04,668 --> 00:45:05,569
Yes.

472
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:08,906
But it is unfortunate,

473
00:45:08,972 --> 00:45:12,176
and I still cannot believe
that Father Salvi is gone,

474
00:45:12,242 --> 00:45:13,610
that he is dead.

475
00:45:15,579 --> 00:45:17,581
What they did was despicable.

476
00:45:19,450 --> 00:45:24,555
The people responsible
for his death must pay.

477
00:45:29,159 --> 00:45:31,795
They are looking for
the bandits now, father.

478
00:45:33,530 --> 00:45:34,364
But you know…

479
00:45:35,199 --> 00:45:39,470
I am just wondering
where they based their decision

480
00:45:39,536 --> 00:45:41,939
in choosing between the two of you,

481
00:45:42,005 --> 00:45:45,075
on who to choose as the messenger

482
00:45:45,142 --> 00:45:46,777
and who will be killed.

483
00:45:48,212 --> 00:45:49,346
I also did not know

484
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:53,050
what the real goal of the bandits was
at that time, Friar.

485
00:45:53,951 --> 00:45:56,787
It seems to be a very convenient excuse

486
00:45:57,521 --> 00:46:02,259
to kill a man over a book, señor.

487
00:46:03,193 --> 00:46:05,496
What are you insinuating, father?

488
00:46:07,397 --> 00:46:12,803
I have become even more interested
in the book Father Salvi kept mentioning.

489
00:46:13,804 --> 00:46:18,942
Isn't it blasphemy to read
a non-religious book?

490
00:46:19,843 --> 00:46:24,214
Especially one that contains
the word "filibusterism", Friar?

491
00:46:25,849 --> 00:46:30,420
Well, what we need is to take extra care
and God's guidance

492
00:46:30,487 --> 00:46:35,025
towards enlightenment and the truth.

493
00:46:36,260 --> 00:46:37,661
But you need to be careful as well…

494
00:46:39,463 --> 00:46:40,898
for you might

495
00:46:41,698 --> 00:46:43,901
suffer the same fate
as the former curate.

496
00:46:45,769 --> 00:46:48,405
Well, look at the time.

497
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:50,774
Good evening, señor.

498
00:47:26,844 --> 00:47:29,513
I, Macaraig, and our other
friends collected contributions.

499
00:47:29,580 --> 00:47:30,747
It's just a small amount,

500
00:47:30,814 --> 00:47:33,116
but you can add it to your funds
to pay off Juli's debt.

501
00:47:33,684 --> 00:47:36,386
I am here to take you home.

502
00:47:36,453 --> 00:47:37,821
Oh, Basilio!

503
00:47:37,888 --> 00:47:38,922
COMING UP

504
00:47:39,623 --> 00:47:42,559
Are you Telesforo Juan de Dios?

505
00:47:43,126 --> 00:47:46,263
Formerly known as Cabeza Tales.

506
00:47:50,801 --> 00:47:53,737
Elias and I took a peek
at the book the other night.

507
00:47:53,804 --> 00:47:57,307
Why did I not see my name in it?

508
00:48:05,883 --> 00:48:08,685
