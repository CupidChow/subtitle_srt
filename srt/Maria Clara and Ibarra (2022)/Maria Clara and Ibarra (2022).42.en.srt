00:00:28,395 --> 00:00:31,564
MARIA CLARA AND IBARRA

2
00:00:31,631 --> 00:00:35,568
THIS PROGRAM, WHICH IS ADAPTED
FROM THE NOVELS OF DR. JOSE P. RIZAL,

3
00:00:35,635 --> 00:00:40,573
IS PRESENTED USING DRAMATIC ELEMENTS
TO CONNECT THE PRESENT AND THE PAST

4
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:46,379
IN A SPECIAL REIMAGINING OF THE NATIONAL
LITERATURE FILIPINOS ARE PROUD OF.

5
00:00:46,446 --> 00:00:49,682
<i>I told you this before
and I will say it again.</i>

6
00:00:49,749 --> 00:00:52,018
I love you so much.

7
00:00:52,085 --> 00:00:56,356
<i>All my life, you're the only one
who has showed me</i>

8
00:00:56,423 --> 00:01:00,160
<i>how it is to be truly loved by a man.</i>

9
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:03,863
<i>Thank you so much
for appreciating me, Fidel.</i>

10
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:06,199
<i>But I need to go now.</i>

11
00:01:06,266 --> 00:01:08,201
<i>Maybe in a different time.</i>

12
00:01:09,602 --> 00:01:13,807
<i>Maybe we're the endgame. Goodbye, Fidel.</i>

13
00:01:13,873 --> 00:01:16,042
<i>Klay? Klay!</i>

14
00:01:22,115 --> 00:01:26,052
Hey! Maria Clara Infantes!

15
00:01:28,621 --> 00:01:30,223
It's really you!

16
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:32,926
<i>I haven't seen you in months.</i>

17
00:01:32,992 --> 00:01:35,395
<i>Maria Clara, stop overacting.</i>

18
00:01:35,462 --> 00:01:38,731
-It's only been a night.
-I've only been gone for a night?

19
00:01:38,798 --> 00:01:40,567
Tell me what's going on!

20
00:01:40,633 --> 00:01:43,069
<i>So many things happened to me.</i>

21
00:01:43,136 --> 00:01:45,071
<i>I met a lot of people.</i>

22
00:01:46,139 --> 00:01:48,074
<i>I've witnessed so much.</i>

23
00:01:49,809 --> 00:01:51,744
<i>And experienced so many things.</i>

24
00:01:54,981 --> 00:01:58,818
<i>I was awakened by what I saw.</i>

25
00:01:58,885 --> 00:02:01,254
I'm sorry I left without saying anything.

26
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:03,256
But I am here now.

27
00:02:03,323 --> 00:02:06,426
Did you run away because you were upset?

28
00:02:06,493 --> 00:02:09,095
-Are you still mad at me?
-No, Mom.

29
00:02:09,162 --> 00:02:11,598
I wasn't upset at all.

30
00:02:12,198 --> 00:02:14,100
Thank you for understanding.

31
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,441
Wow.

32
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,945
I have a lot of realizations.

33
00:02:28,915 --> 00:02:31,751
From the cosplay event.

34
00:02:35,688 --> 00:02:37,090
Like what?

35
00:02:42,095 --> 00:02:44,130
I realized…

36
00:02:46,132 --> 00:02:47,100
the worst.

37
00:02:49,135 --> 00:02:52,071
This country is in shambles.

38
00:02:52,138 --> 00:02:53,406
Even way back then.

39
00:02:55,909 --> 00:02:59,212
I get that we've changed a bit but…

40
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:05,652
we've inherited how sick
and defected the Filipinos were

41
00:03:05,718 --> 00:03:08,388
during the Spanish colonization!

42
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:11,324
My God.

43
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:17,764
Social cancer is still very relevant
in our family health history.

44
00:03:18,298 --> 00:03:20,099
Then and now.

45
00:03:22,402 --> 00:03:27,006
We still find it hard to fight
because of the oppressed and oppressors

46
00:03:27,073 --> 00:03:29,175
who serve the interests of a few.

47
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:33,680
Only basing their actions on what
they think is right and acceptable.

48
00:03:36,115 --> 00:03:38,585
And with that kind of society,

49
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:43,423
it will be so hard to heal
and love ourselves…

50
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:44,557
our neighbors…

51
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:50,897
and our country,
free from pain and suffering.

52
00:03:58,805 --> 00:04:02,542
You realized all of that from the…

53
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:05,745
cosplay event?

54
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:12,151
I know when you mentioned the word…

55
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,154
"defected…"

56
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,025
I'm one of them, Klay.

57
00:04:21,794 --> 00:04:22,962
As a person.

58
00:04:24,397 --> 00:04:25,398
As…

59
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,334
a mother.

60
00:04:32,138 --> 00:04:33,406
But you both know--

61
00:04:33,973 --> 00:04:35,108
You know…

62
00:04:37,243 --> 00:04:38,678
that…

63
00:04:40,647 --> 00:04:45,585
I'm doing everything
for you and your brother, right?

64
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:50,023
That's not what I meant.

65
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:57,063
Mom, I know that.

66
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:00,199
We both know that.

67
00:05:01,668 --> 00:05:05,538
And believe us, we appreciate you.

68
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:08,841
You…

69
00:05:09,776 --> 00:05:10,677
you…

70
00:05:11,911 --> 00:05:15,248
you said it's painful and hard, right?

71
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:21,521
But I love you and Elias so much.

72
00:05:29,262 --> 00:05:32,265
I may not be able to fight for myself.

73
00:05:36,803 --> 00:05:38,438
But you two are my life.

74
00:05:41,107 --> 00:05:45,244
I will fight for you both to the death.

75
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:49,549
I love you, too, Mom.

76
00:05:56,289 --> 00:05:58,024
You too, Big Sis.

77
00:06:02,261 --> 00:06:06,199
I love you both so much too.

78
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:39,565
Is your daughter back?

79
00:06:44,337 --> 00:06:46,038
Your daughter, is she back?

80
00:06:50,042 --> 00:06:52,945
I knew it. You guys were so loud.

81
00:06:54,614 --> 00:06:55,815
No.

82
00:06:56,482 --> 00:07:00,019
I was just having
a serious talk with Klay.

83
00:07:03,055 --> 00:07:06,559
-That kid is really mature--
-Do we have food?

84
00:07:07,693 --> 00:07:09,695
Do we have food? I'm hungry.

85
00:07:11,197 --> 00:07:13,766
No more but I can cook for you.

86
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:15,835
You still have to cook? Forget it.

87
00:07:15,902 --> 00:07:16,903
I'll have a beer.

88
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:22,575
It's too early for that. Don't drink beer.

89
00:07:22,642 --> 00:07:26,045
-Drink water instead.
-But I'm thirsty.

90
00:07:31,384 --> 00:07:35,755
I'm just worried
because your gout might act up again.

91
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:39,559
Will you mind your own business?

92
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:52,038
I'm just reminding you
because I'm worried.

93
00:07:54,207 --> 00:07:56,609
But don't disrespect me.

94
00:07:58,611 --> 00:08:00,112
I'm still your wife.

95
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:03,015
I'm being disrespectful?

96
00:08:03,883 --> 00:08:05,518
You keep talking back!

97
00:08:05,585 --> 00:08:07,854
If I were you, just shut up.

98
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:15,595
I'm just thinking about what Klay said.

99
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:20,066
We still find it hard to fight
because of the oppressed and oppressors

100
00:08:20,132 --> 00:08:22,268
who serve the interests of a few.

101
00:08:23,603 --> 00:08:26,272
Klay, Klay, Klay! Klay this! Klay that!

102
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:29,108
How many times do I have to tell you?

103
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:30,910
I don't care about your daughter.

104
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:34,881
Because for me,
she's just a burden in this house.

105
00:08:34,947 --> 00:08:36,983
Don't talk about my daughter that way!

106
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:38,951
Wow.

107
00:08:40,386 --> 00:08:42,121
You're raising your voice at me now?

108
00:08:43,155 --> 00:08:44,490
You dare raise your voice at me?

109
00:08:59,572 --> 00:09:01,073
I don't know…

110
00:09:03,109 --> 00:09:05,478
how long do I have to put up with you.

111
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,681
I don't know…

112
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:11,384
how long do I have to convince myself

113
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:14,120
that I am not wasting my time on you.

114
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:19,725
If you punch me in the head one more time,

115
00:09:21,827 --> 00:09:23,262
I will leave you.

116
00:09:24,263 --> 00:09:28,334
I'll leave you for good.
Even if you are Elias' father.

117
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:33,839
Hey, don't threaten me.

118
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:35,741
You should be thankful.

119
00:09:35,808 --> 00:09:39,912
I loved you and took you in
even if you're just like that.

120
00:09:41,948 --> 00:09:43,182
Even if I'm like this?

121
00:09:44,383 --> 00:09:46,252
But you hurt me anyway?

122
00:09:48,521 --> 00:09:50,089
What kind of love is that?

123
00:09:52,558 --> 00:09:54,493
If you won't change,

124
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:57,930
I'm telling you, Ronald.

125
00:09:58,531 --> 00:10:01,867
I won't hesitate to do what I just said.

126
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:08,407
-I won't--
-What? What?

127
00:10:11,377 --> 00:10:14,013
I won't allow you to mistreat me again!

128
00:10:15,481 --> 00:10:17,483
I'll pick myself up and grow strong!

129
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:20,019
I'll be free
and you will no longer control me!

130
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,242
Elias really died in the book.

131
00:10:53,119 --> 00:10:54,320
Where's Fidel?

132
00:10:57,757 --> 00:10:59,492
Is he really part of Rizal's story?

133
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:11,103
Mother!

134
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:17,777
Why was I born cursed?

135
00:11:23,949 --> 00:11:26,619
Maria Clara, what has happened to you?

136
00:11:36,162 --> 00:11:37,563
"Father Salvi…

137
00:11:41,801 --> 00:11:45,071
will give a sermon
at the church of Santa Clara

138
00:11:45,137 --> 00:11:50,242
He has an important duty
to accomplish here.

139
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:57,717
Santa Clara?

140
00:11:59,418 --> 00:12:01,887
There are still preparations to be done

141
00:12:01,954 --> 00:12:04,323
for your journey
to the convent of Santa Clara.

142
00:12:04,824 --> 00:12:07,026
It will be dusk soon.

143
00:12:11,464 --> 00:12:12,298
No.

144
00:12:13,466 --> 00:12:15,534
No, no, no.

145
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:25,244
Thank God you had a safe trip
from San Diego, Father Salvi.

146
00:12:25,311 --> 00:12:26,545
Very well.

147
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:32,118
I would like to visit Maria before I rest.

148
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:36,188
It has been a while
since her last confession.

149
00:12:39,158 --> 00:12:40,593
Maria Clara?

150
00:12:47,299 --> 00:12:48,134
Maria?

151
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:52,371
Why is the door locked?
Your confessor, Father Salvi, is here.

152
00:12:55,641 --> 00:12:58,244
He is now in charge of our monastery.

153
00:13:02,081 --> 00:13:03,315
Get the key.

154
00:13:07,319 --> 00:13:08,387
Maria.

155
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:10,656
Open the door.

156
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:13,726
Let me in.

157
00:13:15,528 --> 00:13:21,200
Allow me to help you clean your conscience

158
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:24,270
through God's forgiveness.

159
00:13:33,913 --> 00:13:35,347
Thank you.

160
00:13:36,682 --> 00:13:38,150
Leave us alone.

161
00:13:57,469 --> 00:13:59,672
If you wish to be locked up,

162
00:14:00,906 --> 00:14:02,241
so be it.

163
00:14:04,043 --> 00:14:05,511
What are you doing here?

164
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,315
You poor thing.

165
00:14:10,449 --> 00:14:12,885
Why are you making things
difficult for yourself?

166
00:14:14,053 --> 00:14:17,756
Did you really think you can hide from me?

167
00:14:17,823 --> 00:14:19,124
Get out.

168
00:14:21,794 --> 00:14:23,095
-Maria!
-Get out!

169
00:14:23,162 --> 00:14:26,131
-Get out! Get out!
-Maria, are you being possessed?

170
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:29,335
-Maria! Stop that!
-Get out! Get out of here!

171
00:14:30,336 --> 00:14:31,270
Maria.

172
00:14:32,905 --> 00:14:38,544
That is not the right way
to treat your holy confessor.

173
00:14:39,478 --> 00:14:40,779
Maria…

174
00:14:41,847 --> 00:14:43,949
I buried myself here in the quiet

175
00:14:44,016 --> 00:14:46,352
but you have disrupted me
with your presence!

176
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:54,460
I am ordering you as a messenger of God…

177
00:14:55,628 --> 00:14:58,864
to kneel down right now

178
00:14:59,465 --> 00:15:02,468
and I will perform an exorcism!

179
00:15:02,968 --> 00:15:06,705
I will never kneel and ask
forgiveness from you, you devil!

180
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:12,611
You are the real son of the devil!

181
00:15:16,015 --> 00:15:17,883
I'm hurt…

182
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:21,020
by your welcome, Maria.

183
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:26,225
After all…

184
00:15:27,359 --> 00:15:29,662
the sacrifices I have made.

185
00:15:31,196 --> 00:15:34,967
After everything I did

186
00:15:35,734 --> 00:15:37,469
just to be with you!

187
00:15:48,981 --> 00:15:53,452
-I waited so long…
-Don't! Don't touch me!

188
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:56,188
Let go of me!

189
00:15:56,689 --> 00:15:58,023
Don't touch me!

190
00:16:09,234 --> 00:16:11,136
Mother!

191
00:16:41,233 --> 00:16:42,101
My God.

192
00:16:45,137 --> 00:16:46,538
This can't be.

193
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:54,380
No. Fight back.

194
00:16:54,446 --> 00:16:56,915
Fight back, Maria Clara. Fight back.

195
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:07,493
Touch me again
and I will kill you, you devil!

196
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:09,161
Maria.

197
00:17:09,228 --> 00:17:12,498
-You're the devil! Devil!
-Forgive me.

198
00:17:12,564 --> 00:17:16,268
I only wanted to kiss you, my love.

199
00:17:16,335 --> 00:17:18,203
Put that down, please.

200
00:17:19,505 --> 00:17:20,839
Love?

201
00:17:21,573 --> 00:17:24,376
What do you know about love?

202
00:17:27,446 --> 00:17:30,382
-Maria.
-We don't deserve love!

203
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:37,222
-Don't.
-No one deserves love.

204
00:17:37,823 --> 00:17:39,091
Don't.

205
00:17:40,926 --> 00:17:43,529
I am just going to kill myself.

206
00:17:45,631 --> 00:17:49,234
-For this wickedness to end!
-Please, don't do that.

207
00:17:49,301 --> 00:17:51,070
Don't! Don't, please!

208
00:17:51,637 --> 00:17:53,806
I'll end the curse bestowed on me!

209
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:57,576
This will never happen again, Maria.

210
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:00,045
This will never happen again.

211
00:18:00,112 --> 00:18:04,950
I just got carried away with my emotions.
Maria, do not hurt yourself.

212
00:18:05,784 --> 00:18:07,953
I won't be able to bear it.

213
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:11,390
Please put that down, Maria. Please.

214
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:15,894
Stay away! Stay away from me!

215
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:20,332
Help me!

216
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:27,072
Maria!

217
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:12,638
Mother!

218
00:21:15,741 --> 00:21:19,344
Why was I born cursed?

219
00:21:22,414 --> 00:21:29,354
I beg you, take me to where you are now

220
00:21:29,421 --> 00:21:31,390
with the Lord Almighty!

221
00:21:34,092 --> 00:21:37,429
Take me to a place where I can't be hurt!

222
00:21:40,365 --> 00:21:43,001
Mother!

223
00:21:45,737 --> 00:21:48,507
Take me, your only child!

224
00:21:50,842 --> 00:21:53,779
Bring me to where
the saints and angels reside!

225
00:22:02,287 --> 00:22:06,224
My life is meaningless!

226
00:22:24,242 --> 00:22:25,444
This can't be.

227
00:22:30,916 --> 00:22:31,983
No.

228
00:22:34,453 --> 00:22:37,155
The story can't end that way.

229
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:43,528
Impossible.

230
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:46,798
The book can't end just like that.

231
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:49,468
Besides, that epilogue is not true.

232
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:51,470
That's just a rumor by the gossipmongers.

233
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:52,604
It's not verified.

234
00:22:54,172 --> 00:22:55,674
A lot of things can--

235
00:22:56,441 --> 00:22:57,943
Many things can happen.

236
00:22:58,009 --> 00:22:59,378
Fidel is not there.

237
00:23:00,145 --> 00:23:01,480
And Maria Clara--

238
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:03,081
It can't end like this.

239
00:23:03,148 --> 00:23:04,816
And…

240
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:06,118
Sir Ibarra?

241
00:23:06,852 --> 00:23:08,387
Where is he?

242
00:23:16,928 --> 00:23:19,598
All your questions will be answered

243
00:23:20,332 --> 00:23:21,900
in <i>El Filibusterismo</i>.

244
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:26,304
<i>El Fili</i>.

245
00:23:41,186 --> 00:23:43,355
What's wrong? Is it really that hot?

246
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:46,324
I am getting agitated, girl.

247
00:23:47,659 --> 00:23:49,094
My armpits are soaked.

248
00:23:49,895 --> 00:23:52,931
I really have to find that book.
Where is it?

249
00:24:18,023 --> 00:24:18,990
Hey.

250
00:24:19,558 --> 00:24:21,326
You'll break my fan.

251
00:24:22,093 --> 00:24:24,129
Oh. Sorry, I didn't notice.

252
00:24:26,765 --> 00:24:31,303
And if you love a man,

253
00:24:31,369 --> 00:24:32,904
here is what you need to do.

254
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:34,973
Just fan yourself fast

255
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:38,710
while glancing at his eyes…

256
00:24:39,611 --> 00:24:42,314
with your eyes cast down just like this.

257
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:45,951
Am I hinting at something?

258
00:24:48,954 --> 00:24:50,956
What a deep hint.

259
00:24:51,022 --> 00:24:52,424
Why? Does that mean anything?

260
00:24:55,093 --> 00:24:56,528
Yes, Stacy.

261
00:24:56,595 --> 00:24:59,064
Actually, it has a lot
of meaning behind it.

262
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:00,832
-Really? Okay.
-I'll teach you.

263
00:25:00,899 --> 00:25:02,467
First, don't open it all the way.

264
00:25:03,668 --> 00:25:06,972
If you start fanning yourself
slowly like this…

265
00:25:07,038 --> 00:25:09,140
To tell a man

266
00:25:09,207 --> 00:25:14,513
he is not special to you
without hurting his feelings.

267
00:25:14,579 --> 00:25:17,382
…it means, "I don't like you."

268
00:25:18,717 --> 00:25:21,920
But what's the meaning
behind yours earlier?

269
00:25:26,258 --> 00:25:27,759
It means…

270
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,529
"I like you."

271
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:34,132
OMG!

272
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:39,137
Maria Clara Infantes, are you in love?

273
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:42,574
No way! Please!

274
00:25:43,074 --> 00:25:44,409
It was just a Freudian slip.

275
00:25:44,476 --> 00:25:46,978
Who's the lucky guy? Is he our classmate?

276
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:50,482
You don't know him.

277
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:52,784
What's his name? How did you two meet?

278
00:25:53,351 --> 00:25:56,388
-Well…
-Tell me or I'll pinch you.

279
00:25:56,454 --> 00:25:57,956
-You're so loud.
-I'm sorry.

280
00:25:58,023 --> 00:25:59,224
We're in the library.

281
00:26:01,593 --> 00:26:03,028
It's…

282
00:26:04,763 --> 00:26:06,164
Fidel.

283
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:08,166
I met him at the cosplay event.

284
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:09,768
Your cosplay sideline,

285
00:26:09,834 --> 00:26:12,571
the reason you were MIA yesterday?

286
00:26:12,637 --> 00:26:14,906
Look at you. Let me see a picture of him.

287
00:26:15,674 --> 00:26:17,776
-Let me see it.
-No, I don't have a photo of him.

288
00:26:18,343 --> 00:26:20,779
For sure he's on IG and Facebook.

289
00:26:20,845 --> 00:26:22,814
Come on, let's search for him.

290
00:26:22,881 --> 00:26:24,749
Stacy, he doesn't have those.

291
00:26:24,816 --> 00:26:28,720
-He isn't into social media.
-What? He's so old-fashioned.

292
00:26:30,689 --> 00:26:32,157
Indeed.

293
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:36,995
So are you really in love with him?

294
00:26:37,062 --> 00:26:39,264
Spill the tea, girl.

295
00:26:42,968 --> 00:26:44,302
No!

296
00:26:44,869 --> 00:26:48,573
-So picky.
-We can't be together, okay?

297
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,308
Why not?

298
00:26:50,375 --> 00:26:55,680
You know, when in love,
everything is possible.

299
00:26:56,247 --> 00:26:58,950
You know what? I'm good.

300
00:26:59,017 --> 00:27:00,952
Don't you have gym class?
Go on, I'll be okay.

301
00:27:01,019 --> 00:27:02,587
You're right. Okay, but wait.

302
00:27:02,654 --> 00:27:04,222
See you at lunch, okay?

303
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:05,890
Good luck in finding that book, okay?

304
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:07,425
Give me back my fan.

305
00:27:07,492 --> 00:27:08,760
Bye.

306
00:27:35,353 --> 00:27:36,421
Which one?

307
00:27:58,176 --> 00:27:59,477
Rizal.

308
00:28:00,378 --> 00:28:02,080
I'm begging you.

309
00:28:02,147 --> 00:28:04,983
Make <i>El Fili</i> a good one.

310
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:07,085
Please!

311
00:28:07,152 --> 00:28:10,689
Your characters had suffered
so much in <i>Noli</i>.

312
00:28:12,323 --> 00:28:15,260
I don't think I can take
another heartbreak.

313
00:28:16,594 --> 00:28:18,263
So, please.

314
00:28:18,329 --> 00:28:22,367
Let this be good
because I can't take it anymore!

315
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:28,907
Okay.

316
00:28:37,482 --> 00:28:39,250
<i>"The return of Simoun."</i>

317
00:28:42,287 --> 00:28:43,722
<i>"Deck?"</i>

318
00:28:52,464 --> 00:28:55,200
<i>"Don and doña?"</i>

319
00:28:56,301 --> 00:28:58,069
<i>"Father Florentino".</i>

320
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:01,439
<i>"Father Camorra".</i>

321
00:29:01,506 --> 00:29:03,041
<i>"Father Sa--"</i>

322
00:29:03,842 --> 00:29:05,276
<i>Father Salvi?</i>

323
00:29:05,343 --> 00:29:08,646
<i>So, you're still alive.</i>

324
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:24,896
"Basilio?"

325
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,901
It's really you.

326
00:29:33,004 --> 00:29:35,306
You survived, Basilio.

327
00:29:40,945 --> 00:29:43,148
I'm such a proud big sister.

328
00:29:45,984 --> 00:29:47,719
I really hope you become a doctor.

329
00:29:56,928 --> 00:29:57,962
Goodness!

330
00:29:58,663 --> 00:29:59,964
I'm late!

331
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:26,825
"Gosh."

332
00:30:27,859 --> 00:30:29,294
Isagani.

333
00:31:07,498 --> 00:31:14,205
<i>"To his surprise, Basilio thought</i>
<i>the man looked like the jeweler, Simoun."</i>

334
00:31:22,947 --> 00:31:23,982
Señor?

335
00:31:31,789 --> 00:31:33,091
Señor Simoun?

336
00:31:38,129 --> 00:31:41,065
Is there anything I can do
to help you, señor?

337
00:31:54,979 --> 00:31:56,281
Señor Ibarra?

338
00:32:00,118 --> 00:32:01,786
You know who I am.

339
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:06,624
You know how much I have suffered.

340
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:09,661
To you,

341
00:32:10,962 --> 00:32:13,564
I am not just Simoun the jeweler,

342
00:32:14,732 --> 00:32:19,404
who sells jewelry
to incite the authorities…

343
00:32:21,306 --> 00:32:24,642
and urge the people they oppress

344
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:27,478
to buy my jewels.

345
00:32:29,981 --> 00:32:32,717
I am the judge,

346
00:32:33,217 --> 00:32:35,787
who wants to castigate a system

347
00:32:36,988 --> 00:32:39,123
by using their own transgressions

348
00:32:39,691 --> 00:32:42,493
to fight with flattery!

349
00:32:44,762 --> 00:32:47,365
I will need the help…

350
00:32:53,204 --> 00:32:56,007
of the youth.

351
00:33:05,917 --> 00:33:07,285
Sir.

352
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:09,921
Is that your revenge plot?

353
00:33:14,292 --> 00:33:15,994
What about my namesake?

354
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:24,035
<i>No.</i>

355
00:33:24,902 --> 00:33:25,770
No.

356
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:28,406
Mother of Christ!

357
00:33:28,473 --> 00:33:30,541
This can't be happening to Maria! God!

358
00:33:30,608 --> 00:33:33,411
Sir, hurry! Maybe you can still save her!

359
00:33:39,984 --> 00:33:41,919
I'm sorry, it's my friend.

360
00:33:55,833 --> 00:33:59,971
What's wrong with this book, Rizal?
What about their happy ending?

361
00:34:01,239 --> 00:34:03,007
You're so unfair.

362
00:34:51,789 --> 00:34:54,025
Simoun, not the lamp.

363
00:34:55,993 --> 00:34:58,930
What has gotten into you, Ibarra?

364
00:35:00,298 --> 00:35:02,100
Don't do this, please.

365
00:35:02,166 --> 00:35:03,835
Don't do it. Simoun, don't.

366
00:35:54,385 --> 00:35:55,786
It hurts.

367
00:35:57,588 --> 00:35:59,257
It hurts too much.

368
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:05,997
What's wrong with you, Rizal?
Why does it have to be this way?

369
00:36:07,732 --> 00:36:11,035
Don't they deserve a happy ending?

370
00:36:11,102 --> 00:36:13,638
A redemption? Complete happiness?

371
00:36:14,405 --> 00:36:16,641
Why does it have to end like this?

372
00:36:19,544 --> 00:36:22,113
This book is worse than <i>Noli</i>.

373
00:36:25,283 --> 00:36:29,554
They are not just your characters.
They are my friends too!

374
00:36:57,381 --> 00:36:58,249
Sir.

375
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:00,351
Ms. Klay.

376
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:04,522
How are you?
Have you done your assignment?

377
00:37:04,589 --> 00:37:06,524
You know the answer to that, sir.

378
00:37:06,591 --> 00:37:08,960
And you will get an earful from me.

379
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:13,698
What's funny?

380
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:20,271
Do you remember when you plagiarized
back when you haven't read the book?

381
00:37:20,338 --> 00:37:22,139
Now, look at you.

382
00:37:22,206 --> 00:37:24,842
You are very interested in the characters.

383
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:33,284
Sir, who wouldn't be?
You literally took me inside <i>Noli</i>.

384
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:36,887
Can you give me back the book I lent you?

385
00:37:52,403 --> 00:37:57,742
I hope this changed your perspective
about this country.

386
00:37:59,176 --> 00:38:00,945
As well as being a Filipino.

387
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:04,315
Yes.

388
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:06,851
A lot has changed.

389
00:38:08,152 --> 00:38:10,254
I'm not the same old Klay.

390
00:38:11,188 --> 00:38:13,224
Good to know I didn't fail.

391
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:17,428
Mr. Torres.

392
00:38:17,495 --> 00:38:20,498
I know what's going to happen
to the characters in <i>El Fili</i>.

393
00:38:20,564 --> 00:38:22,033
I have read the book.

394
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:26,370
Wow, good for you.

395
00:38:26,437 --> 00:38:29,507
You should keep reading.

396
00:38:30,074 --> 00:38:32,743
Especially the literary works
of our Filipino writers.

397
00:38:34,912 --> 00:38:37,581
But I need to go back there, Mr. Torres.

398
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:39,784
I need to go inside the book again.

399
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:55,833
Ms. Infantes.

400
00:38:57,535 --> 00:38:58,903
What are you talking about? Why?

401
00:39:00,404 --> 00:39:02,807
I need to save
the characters in the story.

402
00:39:03,808 --> 00:39:05,976
I need to save my friends.

403
00:39:07,511 --> 00:39:08,412
Well…

404
00:39:09,413 --> 00:39:13,217
you don't need to change anything.

405
00:39:13,284 --> 00:39:15,920
You can't. I forbid you to.

406
00:39:16,554 --> 00:39:18,622
What? Why?

407
00:39:19,123 --> 00:39:21,192
Here we go again, Ms. Infantes.

408
00:39:23,627 --> 00:39:25,129
You can't go back anymore.

409
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:30,735
Wait.

410
00:39:30,801 --> 00:39:32,069
Mr. Torres.

411
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:35,306
Do you really think it's that easy?

412
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:38,042
After putting me inside <i>Noli</i>,

413
00:39:38,109 --> 00:39:40,811
making me experience the hell
they've been through,

414
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:43,881
did you expect me not to care at all?

415
00:39:43,948 --> 00:39:45,950
That I should move on with my life?

416
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:49,220
Sir, I've changed.

417
00:39:49,286 --> 00:39:52,957
I am invested in those characters,
that's why I must do something!

418
00:39:53,457 --> 00:39:56,093
What's important is the present.

419
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:58,028
Not the past!

420
00:39:58,095 --> 00:40:01,732
How you see this country and yourself!

421
00:40:01,799 --> 00:40:04,101
Did something happen? Did you change?

422
00:40:04,168 --> 00:40:06,036
That is what's important!

423
00:40:06,103 --> 00:40:08,806
That's why I won't let you go back.

424
00:40:12,042 --> 00:40:15,913
Haven't you learned
what you needed to learn?

425
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:18,349
There is nothing in the past
you can change.

426
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:19,817
It has already been written!

427
00:40:19,884 --> 00:40:24,588
You can't change the events
written in the book!

428
00:40:24,655 --> 00:40:25,923
Remember that!

429
00:40:28,959 --> 00:40:32,196
But I will be there to cheer them up.

430
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:33,697
Right, sir?

431
00:40:35,132 --> 00:40:41,906
At least, I will be there
with the people I have come to love.

432
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:51,449
Ms. Klay.

433
00:40:52,149 --> 00:40:53,784
You are very stubborn.

434
00:40:55,553 --> 00:40:56,787
I will not allow it.

435
00:40:59,323 --> 00:41:00,758
You cannot go back.

436
00:41:05,329 --> 00:41:06,630
But, sir…

437
00:41:09,867 --> 00:41:11,602
You are really stubborn, aren't you?

438
00:41:11,669 --> 00:41:14,772
I will not allow you
to go back inside the book again.

439
00:41:16,941 --> 00:41:18,275
I forbid it.

440
00:43:48,092 --> 00:43:49,760
We're so dead!

441
00:44:01,872 --> 00:44:04,274
No fireflies around?

442
00:44:20,424 --> 00:44:22,559
<i>Noli, Noli…</i>

443
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:26,764
<i>El Fili</i>, where are you?

444
00:44:30,868 --> 00:44:32,069
<i>Noli.</i>

445
00:44:39,143 --> 00:44:40,644
It's not locked.

446
00:44:40,711 --> 00:44:42,680
But why can't I open it?

447
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:53,424
Come on, please open.
I know you're in there, come on.

448
00:45:04,868 --> 00:45:06,537
HOW MUCH LONGER?

449
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:54,852
I can't believe it.

450
00:45:56,653 --> 00:45:59,590
What kind of gimmick is this, Mr. Torres?

451
00:46:37,261 --> 00:46:41,698
Oh, no. I guess I'll bid my graduation
and future goodbye.

452
00:47:20,871 --> 00:47:22,472
Is this the end for me?

453
00:47:22,539 --> 00:47:24,274
I can't go back?

454
00:47:24,341 --> 00:47:27,077
Portal at Fort Santiago?

455
00:47:27,144 --> 00:47:28,679
<i>Don't play with destiny.</i>

456
00:47:28,745 --> 00:47:32,349
<i>Instead of helping,
you might make the situation worse.</i>

457
00:47:32,416 --> 00:47:36,286
<i>Sometimes, you just need to go back
to where you came from.</i>

458
00:47:36,353 --> 00:47:39,923
Sometimes, you need to start
from the beginning

459
00:47:39,990 --> 00:47:42,492
to reach your destination.

460
00:47:48,498 --> 00:47:51,201
COMING UP

461
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:59,376
