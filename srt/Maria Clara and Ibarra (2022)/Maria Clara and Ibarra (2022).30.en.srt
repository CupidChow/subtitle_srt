00:00:28,261 --> 00:00:31,231
MARIA CLARA AND IBARRA

2
00:00:31,297 --> 00:00:35,568
THIS PROGRAM, WHICH IS ADAPTED
FROM THE NOVELS OF DR. JOSE P. RIZAL,

3
00:00:35,635 --> 00:00:40,573
IS PRESENTED USING DRAMATIC ELEMENTS
TO CONNECT THE PRESENT AND THE PAST

4
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:46,346
IN A SPECIAL REIMAGINING OF THE NATIONAL
LITERATURE FILIPINOS ARE PROUD OF.

5
00:00:46,413 --> 00:00:48,548
Forgive me, Uncle,
for dragging you into this problem.

6
00:00:48,615 --> 00:00:51,551
But once the excommunication
punishment is lifted,

7
00:00:51,618 --> 00:00:54,354
even the friars won't be able to stop me
and Maria from being together.

8
00:00:54,921 --> 00:00:58,324
I have been telling you to try
and get along with them.

9
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:01,127
<i>How else do you want me
to get along with them?</i>

10
00:01:01,194 --> 00:01:03,630
I seem to sense rage in your words.

11
00:01:04,197 --> 00:01:07,133
<i>If you really want
to be married to my daughter,</i>

12
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,172
<i>do not destroy your future
by rebelling against the friars.</i>

13
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:17,577
<i>We want to introduce you to
a young</i> peninsulares…

14
00:01:17,644 --> 00:01:20,647
<i>A more deserving man for Maria Clara.</i>

15
00:01:20,713 --> 00:01:26,319
I would like you to meet our nephew,
Señor Alfonso Linares.

16
00:01:26,386 --> 00:01:30,790
<i>But I don't think it's right
to promise Maria to a man</i>

17
00:01:30,857 --> 00:01:32,759
<i>you do not know full well.</i>

18
00:01:32,826 --> 00:01:35,462
Do you think I will put Maria at risk?

19
00:01:35,528 --> 00:01:38,098
She is like a daughter to you.

20
00:01:38,164 --> 00:01:42,368
Maria Clara is Tiago's only child.

21
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:46,306
And who do you think will
benefit from all of that?

22
00:01:46,372 --> 00:01:49,943
Doña Maria Clara, for sure!

23
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:55,415
And her soon-to-be husband.

24
00:01:55,482 --> 00:01:57,150
You are one big disaster!

25
00:02:00,353 --> 00:02:04,290
Qualities that will only
bring trouble and shame to my life!

26
00:02:04,357 --> 00:02:05,358
<i>What did you say?</i>

27
00:02:05,425 --> 00:02:10,296
But those qualities
are also what I love about you.

28
00:02:10,363 --> 00:02:15,235
<i>I will not give up until I have proven
that I am worthy of your love.</i>

29
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:16,970
<i>This can't be, Klay.</i>

30
00:02:18,738 --> 00:02:22,208
The main characters of this story
are none other than Maria Clara and…

31
00:02:22,275 --> 00:02:23,109
Sir Ibarra!

32
00:02:23,176 --> 00:02:25,778
How did your conversation
with the Captain General go?

33
00:02:25,845 --> 00:02:27,213
The outcome was very good.

34
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,417
I am Lucas, the brother of the man
killed by the derrick at your school.

35
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:32,552
PREVIOUSLY…

36
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:40,226
My condolences for your loss.

37
00:02:49,802 --> 00:02:54,474
Mister, this is not enough compensation
for the death of my brother.

38
00:02:58,745 --> 00:03:00,847
Is that so?

39
00:03:00,914 --> 00:03:05,952
What about your brother's attempt
to murder Sir Ibarra?

40
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:07,086
What was that?

41
00:03:08,121 --> 00:03:10,390
I am deeply saddened
by the death of your brother, mister.

42
00:03:10,456 --> 00:03:11,357
But…

43
00:03:12,492 --> 00:03:14,827
I already gave you a huge sum
as a donation.

44
00:03:16,763 --> 00:03:19,332
Now, if you do not have a livelihood,

45
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:21,701
I can hire you in my school
or maybe I can…

46
00:03:21,768 --> 00:03:23,570
I don't need a job, señor.

47
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:28,007
What I need is money as payment
for the life of my brother!

48
00:03:33,746 --> 00:03:35,081
How demanding…

49
00:03:35,748 --> 00:03:38,017
Mister, I don't mean any disrespect,

50
00:03:38,084 --> 00:03:41,854
but I am aware
of your brother's motive to kill me.

51
00:03:43,523 --> 00:03:49,596
So I should not even be obligated
to extend help to you.

52
00:03:51,331 --> 00:03:53,266
It is best if you leave now…

53
00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:56,369
and never come back.

54
00:03:57,437 --> 00:04:00,340
I will never forget this night.

55
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:03,109
You have the nerve to be angry.
This is your brother's fault.

56
00:04:12,518 --> 00:04:14,087
My gosh, sir.

57
00:04:14,153 --> 00:04:16,589
Some people can be really opportunistic.

58
00:04:18,491 --> 00:04:20,526
You can't blame him.

59
00:04:23,229 --> 00:04:25,798
Desperate times
call for desperate measures,

60
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:31,871
especially when those in power continue
to enslave you and hinder your progress.

61
00:04:44,884 --> 00:04:46,386
Thank you, Father.

62
00:04:48,221 --> 00:04:51,124
Thank God your appetite is back.

63
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:53,893
I wonder what helped you get better.

64
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,896
Was it the medicine
prescribed by your doctor

65
00:04:56,963 --> 00:05:01,668
or your confession and communion
with Father Salvi?

66
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:04,170
All right then.

67
00:05:04,237 --> 00:05:06,139
I'll have them bring you
more food, all right?

68
00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:09,976
Thank you, Father.

69
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:20,320
Lord…

70
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:24,157
I thank your kind heart

71
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:29,062
for letting Crisostomo and I
see each other again.

72
00:05:29,896 --> 00:05:34,367
Please guide him
and give him enough strength

73
00:05:34,434 --> 00:05:37,737
to get through all the challenges
that he is facing right now.

74
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:39,839
Amen.

75
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:50,717
I heard that the Captain General
did not stay long

76
00:05:50,783 --> 00:05:53,086
at Captain Tiago's house.

77
00:05:54,454 --> 00:05:58,558
He left yesterday to get back to Manila.

78
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,296
I'm sure that Father Damaso will be glad

79
00:06:04,297 --> 00:06:08,501
that he won't have
to pay tribute to officials

80
00:06:08,568 --> 00:06:10,737
who don't even like him.

81
00:06:10,803 --> 00:06:16,409
What if he will make good
on his promise to Señor Ibarra

82
00:06:16,476 --> 00:06:18,745
to lift his excommunication?

83
00:06:18,811 --> 00:06:22,248
I'm sure that you and Father Damaso
will be put to shame

84
00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:23,883
in front of the people.

85
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,385
Good morning, Curate.

86
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:32,692
And what are you doing here, Lucas?

87
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:36,229
Didn't I tell you that you are not allowed
to come here?

88
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:42,869
Your Reverence,
I came here to report Mr. Ibarra.

89
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:51,177
Leave us, Renato.

90
00:06:59,152 --> 00:07:04,223
And what is it that you want
to tell me, Indio?

91
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:08,561
Instead of paying for damages
for my brother's death,

92
00:07:08,628 --> 00:07:12,098
he only gave me a small amount
as a donation.

93
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:18,070
You should be thankful
he even gave you anything at all.

94
00:07:18,905 --> 00:07:22,508
You Indios

95
00:07:22,575 --> 00:07:26,045
are very opportunistic.

96
00:07:27,513 --> 00:07:30,817
Forgive me, Curate.
I don't understand what you're saying.

97
00:07:30,883 --> 00:07:34,954
All I want is to get justice
for what happened to my brother.

98
00:07:35,755 --> 00:07:37,857
To what extent are you willing to go

99
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:42,295
to get the justice you want?

100
00:07:42,361 --> 00:07:44,697
I will do anything

101
00:07:44,764 --> 00:07:47,333
just to make that arrogant gentleman pay.

102
00:07:51,037 --> 00:07:54,307
I think the Lord has heard my prayers.

103
00:07:56,576 --> 00:07:59,378
Well then, I will support you.

104
00:07:59,445 --> 00:08:04,884
Because I believe
that Crisostomo Ibarra needs to pay

105
00:08:04,951 --> 00:08:06,452
for everything he did.

106
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:11,991
That will only happen
if we break his connection

107
00:08:12,058 --> 00:08:13,593
to the Captain General

108
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:17,997
and to the other powerful officials
who support him.

109
00:08:19,732 --> 00:08:22,134
It's not enough
that he is seen as a heretic.

110
00:08:23,202 --> 00:08:27,640
He needs to go to prison
because he is a filibuster!

111
00:08:29,876 --> 00:08:31,944
I want you to do something.

112
00:08:48,728 --> 00:08:51,297
<i>Arnis</i> was already popular in this era?

113
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:55,902
Cool.

114
00:08:55,968 --> 00:08:56,969
Impressive.

115
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:07,113
Ms. Klay.

116
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:09,181
Have you been there long?

117
00:09:11,817 --> 00:09:13,119
A bit.

118
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,689
Sir, have you seen Sir Fidel lately?

119
00:09:18,691 --> 00:09:20,459
Were you able to talk to him?

120
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:23,930
Did he tell you something about me?

121
00:09:25,498 --> 00:09:28,034
My friend and I haven't seen
each other again.

122
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,002
Maybe he is busy with his business.

123
00:09:32,038 --> 00:09:33,239
Why?

124
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:36,409
What does he need to tell me about you?

125
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:41,714
Señor, there are people looking for you.

126
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:46,018
Good morning, señor.

127
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:47,620
Good morning too.

128
00:09:47,687 --> 00:09:49,255
This is a letter for you.

129
00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:52,992
It came from the office
of the Captain General.

130
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:55,595
It has the signature
of His Highness, the Archbishop.

131
00:09:55,661 --> 00:09:57,029
From the Archbishop?

132
00:10:07,673 --> 00:10:08,741
What does it say?

133
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:13,813
Good news, Ms. Klay.

134
00:10:14,914 --> 00:10:18,517
The Archbishop has already
lifted my excommunication

135
00:10:18,584 --> 00:10:20,419
because of the Captain General's request.

136
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:23,089
I am no longer an outcast.

137
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:26,459
I can now marry Maria.

138
00:10:31,764 --> 00:10:34,333
Thank you very much, señor.

139
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:38,738
Please tell the Captain General
that he is indeed a true friend.

140
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:40,172
I will.

141
00:10:40,239 --> 00:10:42,241
Goodbye, señor and señorita.

142
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:44,243
Goodbye.

143
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:01,293
Father…

144
00:11:02,395 --> 00:11:03,396
Maria!

145
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:07,433
What your auntie said was true.

146
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,136
-You are no longer sick.
-Yes, father.

147
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:13,572
That is why we are going to the church

148
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:15,641
to pray the novena and give Him thanks.

149
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:18,511
As you should. Very good.

150
00:11:18,577 --> 00:11:21,547
Isabel, please take good care
of my daughter, all right?

151
00:11:22,214 --> 00:11:24,283
I always do, my cousin.

152
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,419
Very well, dear. Let's go.

153
00:11:31,123 --> 00:11:33,993
Maria, my angel!

154
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:35,327
Godfather.

155
00:11:39,265 --> 00:11:41,033
Good morning, señor and señora.

156
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,703
It is truly a beautiful day.

157
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:47,840
Because today,
you are destined to meet someone

158
00:11:47,907 --> 00:11:51,210
who will truly save you
from a cursed fate.

159
00:11:53,512 --> 00:11:55,881
What is the señora
talking about, Godfather?

160
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:00,019
We have another companion

161
00:12:00,086 --> 00:12:04,690
that I would like you all
and my goddaughter to meet.

162
00:12:05,925 --> 00:12:08,094
Tiburcio, let him in.

163
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:15,935
There he is.

164
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:20,139
Doña Isabel, Captain Tiago, Maria Clara,

165
00:12:20,206 --> 00:12:24,810
I want you all to meet
our relative from Spain!

166
00:12:32,051 --> 00:12:33,419
Good morning, everyone.

167
00:12:33,486 --> 00:12:37,690
Especially to you, Doña Maria Clara.

168
00:12:43,496 --> 00:12:45,064
Here's your change, miss.

169
00:12:47,733 --> 00:12:51,504
Can you really not love me back, miss?

170
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:55,341
Whatever! I don't have time for this!

171
00:12:55,407 --> 00:12:57,309
I said, here's your change.

172
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:01,914
Thank you.

173
00:13:01,981 --> 00:13:03,682
Apologies. I just spaced out.

174
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:10,656
Klay, let's focus on the real story,

175
00:13:10,723 --> 00:13:14,894
which is Project Happy Ending
for Maria Clara and Ibarra.

176
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,829
Not for you.

177
00:13:16,896 --> 00:13:18,864
You keep on seeing things.

178
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:27,039
Be careful next time you do
something again.

179
00:13:27,106 --> 00:13:30,476
Once you are bound,
it's difficult to break free.

180
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:33,445
But if there is a reasonable price
in return,

181
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:36,782
is there anything else to lose?

182
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,252
I really am in a wet market.

183
00:14:06,812 --> 00:14:09,882
Good morning, Sacristan Mayor.

184
00:14:09,949 --> 00:14:11,951
Why were you talking to that man?

185
00:14:12,985 --> 00:14:16,188
It's you again, you meddlesome woman.

186
00:14:16,255 --> 00:14:18,324
You have a real temper.

187
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:20,226
I was just asking.

188
00:14:20,292 --> 00:14:23,829
I'm just worried because that man
tried to extort money from us last night.

189
00:14:23,896 --> 00:14:26,265
I was thinking
that he might do the same to you.

190
00:14:27,299 --> 00:14:29,501
Maybe you had something to do
with the trouble he caused?

191
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:38,177
We should be the ones
asking you questions, miss.

192
00:14:40,346 --> 00:14:41,647
Beloved Curate.

193
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:45,651
I was just asking

194
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:49,555
if you're up to something again.

195
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:53,325
If not, then that's good.

196
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:54,526
Bye.

197
00:14:54,593 --> 00:14:56,896
Because honestly,
I don't want any trouble.

198
00:14:56,962 --> 00:14:58,130
I will go ahead.

199
00:14:58,197 --> 00:15:03,802
What demon possessed you
to have the audacity

200
00:15:03,869 --> 00:15:06,538
to interrogate a disciple of God?

201
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:10,542
Forgive me.

202
00:15:10,609 --> 00:15:12,845
We were not able to prepare anything.

203
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:15,748
We were not informed that you were coming.

204
00:15:15,814 --> 00:15:17,983
Father, forgive me.

205
00:15:18,717 --> 00:15:20,152
Señora, señores.

206
00:15:20,219 --> 00:15:23,422
No need to ask forgiveness, Tiago,

207
00:15:23,489 --> 00:15:28,994
because your families
will soon become one.

208
00:15:29,061 --> 00:15:34,199
Because I want to pair up Alfonso
with Maria Clara.

209
00:15:37,803 --> 00:15:39,204
Pair us up, Godfather?

210
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:41,040
Yes, my love.

211
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:44,710
You know, I saw in this bachelor

212
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:52,184
the character of a man deserving to be
with a princess like you.

213
00:15:52,818 --> 00:15:57,122
And I want Alfonso to be your husband

214
00:15:57,189 --> 00:16:01,627
instead of Crisostomo Ibarra.

215
00:16:08,267 --> 00:16:10,836
Maria, why did you drop that?

216
00:16:10,903 --> 00:16:12,571
You will have bad luck.

217
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:18,577
That is just a proverbial saying
of the Indios, señora.

218
00:16:19,578 --> 00:16:21,313
So don't worry about it.

219
00:16:27,252 --> 00:16:30,122
Can we talk in private, Godfather? Please.

220
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:41,266
Forgive me.

221
00:16:45,371 --> 00:16:47,840
Godfather, forgive me,

222
00:16:47,906 --> 00:16:52,811
but I cannot marry a man I do not know.

223
00:16:58,017 --> 00:16:59,685
Maria,

224
00:16:59,752 --> 00:17:03,622
why are you acting
as if this is new to you?

225
00:17:05,257 --> 00:17:08,060
You are aware that many people
who get married

226
00:17:08,127 --> 00:17:12,064
only meet for the first time
on the day of their wedding.

227
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:16,168
You are actually in a better situation
with Señor Linares

228
00:17:16,235 --> 00:17:19,938
because you have a chance to talk
and get to know each other.

229
00:17:21,173 --> 00:17:26,145
You will soon realize
that he is worthy to be your husband

230
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:31,250
instead of a violent mestizo
who hurts friars.

231
00:17:38,257 --> 00:17:39,758
With all due respect, Godfather.

232
00:17:42,494 --> 00:17:47,566
You cannot blame Crisostomo,
because you also angered him.

233
00:17:48,834 --> 00:17:50,135
My goodness, Maria!

234
00:17:50,936 --> 00:17:54,139
Did I not teach you
not to talk back to your elders?

235
00:17:55,674 --> 00:17:57,843
Apologize to your godfather right away.

236
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,344
There's no need.

237
00:18:00,045 --> 00:18:03,949
I understand Maria's hesitation.

238
00:18:04,016 --> 00:18:08,487
But if she will give
Señor Linares a chance--

239
00:18:08,554 --> 00:18:10,756
My decision is final.

240
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:14,259
I will only get married to Crisostomo.

241
00:18:17,729 --> 00:18:19,231
Father, Auntie,

242
00:18:20,466 --> 00:18:23,135
I will leave it up to you
to show our guests out.

243
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:26,004
Goodbye, Godfather.

244
00:18:27,306 --> 00:18:28,774
Wait, Maria.

245
00:18:31,477 --> 00:18:36,748
I will not allow your future
to be destroyed

246
00:18:36,815 --> 00:18:40,853
by ending up with that man.

247
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:46,558
I'm sure your future will be dark
if you marry him.

248
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:50,129
You will have a better future

249
00:18:50,195 --> 00:18:54,199
if you will marry Señor Linares.

250
00:19:03,509 --> 00:19:06,178
You really never learn, woman.

251
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:09,314
What are you doing here near the church?

252
00:19:10,749 --> 00:19:12,050
Were you spying on us?

253
00:19:12,117 --> 00:19:14,953
It is obvious that I am just here
to buy things, right?

254
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:16,889
It just so happened that I saw your helper

255
00:19:16,955 --> 00:19:19,358
escorting out the brother
of the yellow man.

256
00:19:21,426 --> 00:19:26,365
Is there anything wrong
with a bereaved Indio asking for help

257
00:19:26,431 --> 00:19:29,735
because of your good friend?

258
00:19:29,801 --> 00:19:31,570
You are malicious!

259
00:19:31,637 --> 00:19:33,605
Well, there you go.

260
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:35,407
It is clear then.

261
00:19:35,474 --> 00:19:36,942
Why are you getting defensive?

262
00:19:37,609 --> 00:19:39,178
Now, let go of me

263
00:19:39,244 --> 00:19:41,313
because everyone is already
looking at you, Father.

264
00:19:45,984 --> 00:19:49,721
Do you think these Indios scare me?

265
00:19:50,822 --> 00:19:52,858
You are no longer under Maria's care.

266
00:19:54,126 --> 00:19:56,261
She can no longer protect you.

267
00:19:57,095 --> 00:20:02,000
And I will no longer let
your defamatory words pass!

268
00:20:05,971 --> 00:20:08,407
Look at this woman!

269
00:20:09,908 --> 00:20:12,644
She is worse than an animal.

270
00:20:13,245 --> 00:20:15,948
She is a minion of the devil
who has done nothing

271
00:20:16,014 --> 00:20:20,385
but disrespect the ways of this town

272
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:25,657
and prosecute the messengers of God!

273
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,101
And you, Father,

274
00:20:37,336 --> 00:20:39,938
who should be making the decision for me.

275
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:46,011
What is your decision on this matter?

276
00:20:49,781 --> 00:20:53,986
Why don't you get to know
Mr. Linares first?

277
00:20:54,052 --> 00:20:57,823
Talk to each other so that
you two will get along.

278
00:20:57,889 --> 00:21:01,426
Very good. Very good, Santiago!

279
00:21:01,493 --> 00:21:06,865
Isabel, escort Maria Clara
and Mr. Linares to the balcony

280
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:09,234
so they can talk.

281
00:21:10,068 --> 00:21:11,036
Yes, Father.

282
00:21:15,007 --> 00:21:16,108
Let's go, my child.

283
00:21:22,414 --> 00:21:23,248
Let's go.

284
00:21:56,882 --> 00:22:00,319
Bring those to the home of the Chinese

285
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,522
and please make sure
that nothing gets broken.

286
00:22:04,423 --> 00:22:05,424
Yes, señor.

287
00:22:15,467 --> 00:22:16,702
My friend!

288
00:22:20,205 --> 00:22:21,440
My friend!

289
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:26,211
My suspicion was right.

290
00:22:26,278 --> 00:22:29,481
You are busy and that's why
you are no longer able to see

291
00:22:29,548 --> 00:22:32,017
how your good friend is doing.

292
00:22:35,587 --> 00:22:39,791
Is there anything new with you, my friend?

293
00:22:42,227 --> 00:22:44,096
Good news, my friend.

294
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:48,166
The archbishop
has lifted my excommunication.

295
00:22:50,435 --> 00:22:53,038
This means that I can now
marry Maria Clara.

296
00:22:54,106 --> 00:22:56,274
That's why I am going
to their home right now,

297
00:22:56,341 --> 00:22:58,276
to share this news.

298
00:23:06,585 --> 00:23:07,419
My friend…

299
00:23:10,756 --> 00:23:13,792
Do you really love Maria?

300
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,428
Or perhaps…

301
00:23:16,495 --> 00:23:19,264
you love another woman?

302
00:23:20,332 --> 00:23:23,402
Like Ms. Klay, for example.

303
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:32,677
And what made you think that Ms. Klay is…

304
00:23:36,515 --> 00:23:37,983
Yes, you are right.

305
00:23:39,351 --> 00:23:41,586
It is true that she is lovely.

306
00:23:43,522 --> 00:23:46,024
But she is just a good friend

307
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:50,462
who I treat like a younger sister.

308
00:23:51,496 --> 00:23:53,532
So you better stop your teasing

309
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:58,336
because there is no other woman
I want to marry other than Maria Clara.

310
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:06,711
My goodness!

311
00:24:07,646 --> 00:24:10,215
Why did you have to embrace me, my friend?

312
00:24:11,016 --> 00:24:12,451
I am just happy, my friend,

313
00:24:12,517 --> 00:24:14,953
that you are no longer
excommunicated, right?

314
00:24:15,554 --> 00:24:19,391
-Yes.
-That's really good news, my friend!

315
00:24:21,326 --> 00:24:22,627
That's true.

316
00:24:28,266 --> 00:24:31,169
You better thank God

317
00:24:31,236 --> 00:24:36,741
that I still have some forgiveness
and patience left.

318
00:24:37,409 --> 00:24:41,880
May you all emulate my good nature

319
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:45,317
and not this woman's!

320
00:24:57,295 --> 00:24:59,030
Just be thankful

321
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:02,801
that I don't have time
for people like you.

322
00:25:03,735 --> 00:25:08,840
If you try to question my disciples again,

323
00:25:11,209 --> 00:25:15,547
if you tell your friends about this,

324
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:21,586
your dear curate will do much worse things

325
00:25:22,854 --> 00:25:24,756
to all of you.

326
00:25:27,292 --> 00:25:30,061
Your dear curate
is more valuable than your life

327
00:25:31,329 --> 00:25:34,232
and the lives of your loved ones
in this town.

328
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:54,252
Miss…

329
00:26:04,429 --> 00:26:05,697
Thank you.

330
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:16,975
What I heard is true.

331
00:26:17,609 --> 00:26:19,878
You are truly very beautiful.

332
00:26:32,724 --> 00:26:35,827
I understand what you're trying to say
with your fan.

333
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:42,534
I know that you have a fiancé.

334
00:26:43,835 --> 00:26:46,137
But he will not get in my way

335
00:26:46,204 --> 00:26:50,275
because I am ready
to prove myself to you, señorita.

336
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:56,481
You do not mean anything to her,
young man.

337
00:26:57,048 --> 00:26:59,751
I will not force you
to like me now, señorita.

338
00:27:00,852 --> 00:27:03,922
Yes, I may not mean anything to you yet.

339
00:27:04,956 --> 00:27:09,260
But the time will come
when you will see my worth.

340
00:27:20,505 --> 00:27:23,441
My Maria Clara is not interested, son.

341
00:27:27,912 --> 00:27:30,115
Now that we have met

342
00:27:30,181 --> 00:27:33,051
and I have shown you how I feel…

343
00:27:34,619 --> 00:27:36,388
You may go now, señor.

344
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:44,162
Again, good day to you, and goodbye.

345
00:28:08,219 --> 00:28:09,354
Good morning, mister.

346
00:28:11,289 --> 00:28:12,390
Good morning to you too.

347
00:28:13,458 --> 00:28:14,492
Do we know each other?

348
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:17,662
You don't know me, but I know you.

349
00:28:17,729 --> 00:28:19,464
Let me introduce myself.

350
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:22,701
My name is Pedro.

351
00:28:22,767 --> 00:28:23,935
Sisa is my wife.

352
00:28:24,569 --> 00:28:27,772
<i>I'm the father of Crispin and Basilio.</i>

353
00:28:34,913 --> 00:28:36,581
How come you only introduced yourself now?

354
00:28:37,682 --> 00:28:41,019
Are you aware of what happened
to your wife and sons?

355
00:28:41,086 --> 00:28:43,121
I only found out recently

356
00:28:43,688 --> 00:28:46,124
because I just came back
from another province.

357
00:28:46,191 --> 00:28:52,464
I was so surprised when I didn't
see my family in our house.

358
00:28:53,031 --> 00:28:55,567
If I had not bumped into Pilosopo Tasyo,

359
00:28:55,633 --> 00:28:58,369
I would not have found out
what happened to them.

360
00:28:58,436 --> 00:29:00,839
Do not fret, mister.

361
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:03,208
I am looking for your sons.

362
00:29:03,274 --> 00:29:06,511
Meanwhile, I had Ms. Sisa
taken to the hospice

363
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:07,946
to help her mind get better.

364
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:11,616
You may visit her there.

365
00:29:12,217 --> 00:29:14,586
And if you want, I can have
my coachman take you there.

366
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:18,423
What else can she possibly do
if she's already crazy?

367
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:24,329
You will be able to help me better
if you buy our small farmland.

368
00:29:24,395 --> 00:29:27,365
I can use the money to start a new life.

369
00:29:31,469 --> 00:29:33,872
What kind of father and husband are you

370
00:29:34,839 --> 00:29:38,176
if you only think about yourself
instead of your family?

371
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:42,747
Is there anything I can do
to bring back my wife's sanity?

372
00:29:42,814 --> 00:29:44,048
Or to bring back my sons?

373
00:29:45,216 --> 00:29:46,484
What do you want me to do?

374
00:29:46,985 --> 00:29:50,121
To just cry about it?

375
00:29:53,591 --> 00:29:54,526
Apologies, mister.

376
00:29:54,592 --> 00:29:58,930
But I wish for you to get out of my sight.

377
00:30:08,339 --> 00:30:10,341
Who do you think you are?

378
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:18,116
The world is round.

379
00:30:19,517 --> 00:30:20,752
Your downfall will come.

380
00:30:22,787 --> 00:30:24,088
That's right.

381
00:30:25,056 --> 00:30:28,059
And if you want that to happen sooner,

382
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:31,462
why don't we work together?

383
00:30:32,263 --> 00:30:36,067
In exchange for this blessed money
that will help you start anew.

384
00:30:41,639 --> 00:30:46,544
Ensure that that woman will not be able
to set foot in this church.

385
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:49,047
You should be careful too.

386
00:30:49,113 --> 00:30:53,051
That little demon is onto us.

387
00:30:54,252 --> 00:30:59,757
Good thing she did not find
any evidence against us.

388
00:30:59,824 --> 00:31:01,092
She only has her suspicions.

389
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:05,597
But everyone saw how you humiliated her.

390
00:31:05,663 --> 00:31:08,199
Of course, for her to learn her lesson.

391
00:31:09,167 --> 00:31:11,569
I am aware that I'm not like Father Damaso

392
00:31:11,636 --> 00:31:13,972
who uses that way to discipline others.

393
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:19,210
But now, I feel the relief
he feels when he does it.

394
00:31:20,311 --> 00:31:24,048
Now, she should be thankful

395
00:31:24,115 --> 00:31:28,686
that I have more important
things to attend to.

396
00:31:31,022 --> 00:31:34,592
Dear Curate,
is there anything else you need?

397
00:31:34,659 --> 00:31:37,762
Keep an eye on Klay.

398
00:31:37,829 --> 00:31:42,200
If she needs to be followed,
have someone do it.

399
00:31:42,267 --> 00:31:47,272
She must not get in the way of my plans

400
00:31:47,338 --> 00:31:49,340
for Ibarra and Maria Clara.

401
00:32:14,165 --> 00:32:18,136
My dearest Ms. Klay, good afternoon.

402
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:20,305
Where have you been?

403
00:32:20,371 --> 00:32:22,373
I have been waiting for you.

404
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:24,008
Don't ask.

405
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:26,878
I'm not in the mood.

406
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:29,414
I don't know.

407
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:31,482
Asking questions seems to be
forbidden in this place.

408
00:32:31,549 --> 00:32:33,151
If you do, you will just get in trouble.

409
00:32:33,217 --> 00:32:35,420
As for me, I have been staying
here for so long now,

410
00:32:35,486 --> 00:32:37,422
and yet I still don't get it!

411
00:32:39,824 --> 00:32:41,125
Ms. Klay, wait.

412
00:32:43,494 --> 00:32:44,896
Ms. Klay, you're shaking.

413
00:32:52,704 --> 00:32:53,905
No.

414
00:32:55,773 --> 00:32:56,941
I can do this.

415
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:01,079
I just need to calm myself down.

416
00:33:30,541 --> 00:33:32,210
-Hold on.
-I can…

417
00:33:32,276 --> 00:33:33,845
Are you making fun of me again?

418
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:37,448
No, Ms. Klay.

419
00:33:38,416 --> 00:33:41,652
It looks like what you're doing
is helping you, right?

420
00:33:41,719 --> 00:33:43,621
So maybe it will help me too.

421
00:33:44,922 --> 00:33:50,194
Because I also want to calm myself down
from being too worried about you.

422
00:33:54,132 --> 00:33:56,868
Ms. Klay, I won't ask you
about what happened to you

423
00:33:56,934 --> 00:33:59,103
if you don't want me to.

424
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:00,638
But I hope…

425
00:34:01,572 --> 00:34:03,775
it will be of help
if you let me stay here with you.

426
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:07,345
So that, somehow, it will make

427
00:34:07,412 --> 00:34:09,347
whatever you're going through
right now disappear.

428
00:34:35,106 --> 00:34:36,674
<i>If you think about it…</i>

429
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:40,411
Señor Linares is a first-class gentleman.

430
00:34:40,478 --> 00:34:44,515
That is why he is
perfect for you, my dear.

431
00:34:46,717 --> 00:34:47,718
Auntie…

432
00:34:47,785 --> 00:34:50,721
That never even crossed my mind.

433
00:34:50,788 --> 00:34:52,256
So I beg you.

434
00:34:52,323 --> 00:34:54,225
Let us not talk about him anymore, please.

435
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:09,540
They said you did not talk
to Señor Linares that much.

436
00:35:10,541 --> 00:35:11,375
Maria,

437
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:14,412
since when did you become ill-mannered

438
00:35:14,479 --> 00:35:17,882
in welcoming your special guests?

439
00:35:18,649 --> 00:35:20,952
Forgive me, Father.

440
00:35:21,018 --> 00:35:25,656
But Maria tried to be respectful
toward Mr. Linares.

441
00:35:25,723 --> 00:35:30,495
But maybe we really cannot dictate
one's heart to--

442
00:35:30,561 --> 00:35:33,931
This is not about the heart.

443
00:35:34,499 --> 00:35:37,768
This is about common sense.

444
00:35:40,304 --> 00:35:41,472
Maria…

445
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:46,043
I think it would be better
for you to come out,

446
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:51,315
and ask forgiveness
for the way you welcomed them.

447
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:54,352
No.

448
00:35:54,418 --> 00:35:55,920
I will not do it, Godfather.

449
00:36:06,864 --> 00:36:08,799
Please, Maria.

450
00:36:09,967 --> 00:36:11,469
Do not make your godfather angry.

451
00:36:13,204 --> 00:36:15,973
Face Mr. Linares again.

452
00:36:16,974 --> 00:36:18,643
Be nice to them.

453
00:36:20,811 --> 00:36:22,613
Do it for me, my child.

454
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:25,082
I beg you, please.

455
00:36:39,797 --> 00:36:41,933
Let me. Thank you.

456
00:36:43,634 --> 00:36:45,269
Why do you have that?

457
00:36:45,336 --> 00:36:47,772
I should be the one doing that
because you are the guest here.

458
00:36:49,106 --> 00:36:53,811
Ms. Klay, you need to quench your thirst
to help you feel relieved.

459
00:36:58,649 --> 00:36:59,550
Thank you.

460
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:44,795
Ms. Klay.

461
00:37:56,974 --> 00:37:58,175
Maria.

462
00:37:58,242 --> 00:38:00,378
Thank you for facing us.

463
00:38:03,481 --> 00:38:06,284
I just want to grant the request
of my father and godfather.

464
00:38:08,019 --> 00:38:11,422
But I also do not want
to give you false hopes.

465
00:38:11,489 --> 00:38:13,424
You know that I already have a fiancé.

466
00:38:14,025 --> 00:38:14,859
Maria?

467
00:38:18,162 --> 00:38:19,664
That is all right, Father.

468
00:38:20,264 --> 00:38:22,867
My dear, Maria Clara,

469
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:29,840
just think of Ibarra
as a sick person who is dying.

470
00:38:31,375 --> 00:38:36,113
Dear, what can
an excommunicated man offer you?

471
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:39,717
Yes! That is true.

472
00:38:39,784 --> 00:38:46,357
You are also going to destroy
yourself because of him.

473
00:38:47,958 --> 00:38:51,329
You heard what I said earlier.

474
00:38:52,897 --> 00:38:54,632
I already have a fiancé.

475
00:38:56,233 --> 00:38:58,736
I choose to get married only to Crisostomo

476
00:39:01,105 --> 00:39:03,607
and not to anyone else.

477
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:07,244
Why did you bring me flowers?

478
00:39:08,579 --> 00:39:11,082
That's really my present for you, right?

479
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:16,854
That was before you made me worry earlier.

480
00:39:33,237 --> 00:39:36,006
Ms. Klay, you don't like it?

481
00:39:36,907 --> 00:39:39,176
I'm sorry. I think I'm allergic.

482
00:39:40,644 --> 00:39:41,545
Allergic?

483
00:39:41,612 --> 00:39:45,282
Oh, right. They don't use the word
"allergic" in this era yet.

484
00:39:45,349 --> 00:39:46,550
It's…

485
00:39:46,617 --> 00:39:48,085
What I mean is…

486
00:39:48,152 --> 00:39:51,122
It's like a person's
hypersensitive reaction

487
00:39:51,188 --> 00:39:53,758
to a substance or a thing
in an environment.

488
00:39:55,159 --> 00:39:58,129
This may be harmless to ordinary people.

489
00:39:58,195 --> 00:40:01,098
But the reaction may
be from flowers or dust.

490
00:40:02,299 --> 00:40:03,434
You don't get it?

491
00:40:05,202 --> 00:40:06,904
What you mean is that…

492
00:40:08,005 --> 00:40:09,306
you are allergic…

493
00:40:10,307 --> 00:40:11,542
to my gift?

494
00:40:12,643 --> 00:40:14,779
And to my love for you?

495
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:20,384
Are you the one who's hypersensitive?

496
00:40:20,451 --> 00:40:22,520
That's not what I meant.

497
00:40:23,487 --> 00:40:26,690
Ms. Klay, if you don't like
what I gave you,

498
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:28,959
just tell me directly.

499
00:40:29,026 --> 00:40:31,562
Don't beat around the bush
with your words and terms

500
00:40:31,629 --> 00:40:32,963
that I don't even understand.

501
00:40:37,401 --> 00:40:38,269
Give me that.

502
00:40:38,335 --> 00:40:40,137
Why are you angry? I'm sorry.

503
00:40:40,204 --> 00:40:41,539
-Sorry.
-Sorry?

504
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:44,542
-Give it to me. Never mind.
-You already gave it to me, right?

505
00:41:46,637 --> 00:41:50,908
I apologize for the unkind words
uttered by my goddaughter.

506
00:41:52,243 --> 00:41:55,346
But my decision will still prevail…

507
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:58,716
So, Tiburcio,

508
00:41:58,782 --> 00:42:01,485
prepare to ask
for Maria's hand in marriage.

509
00:42:04,054 --> 00:42:05,222
Father…

510
00:42:05,289 --> 00:42:08,826
Perhaps we should discuss this
at another time.

511
00:42:09,393 --> 00:42:11,128
Maria has just recovered from her illness.

512
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:12,997
That is right, Father.

513
00:42:13,063 --> 00:42:15,132
Maria might relapse…

514
00:42:16,166 --> 00:42:18,202
Let us grant Maria's request, Father.

515
00:42:18,269 --> 00:42:20,871
Maria Clara might need to rest.

516
00:42:24,975 --> 00:42:26,110
All right then.

517
00:42:27,811 --> 00:42:28,646
Fine.

518
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:32,616
Rest well, my child.

519
00:42:32,683 --> 00:42:36,420
And weigh your options well
for your future's sake.

520
00:42:37,621 --> 00:42:42,459
A good future you cannot get
from someone who is ill-mannered

521
00:42:43,794 --> 00:42:47,331
but you will likely only get
from Mr. Linares.

522
00:42:50,534 --> 00:42:52,303
Let's go, Alfonso.

523
00:42:52,870 --> 00:42:54,538
Until next time, friends!

524
00:43:00,077 --> 00:43:02,313
How dare you come here!

525
00:43:02,913 --> 00:43:03,747
Crisostomo?

526
00:43:06,350 --> 00:43:07,585
Yuck!

527
00:43:19,530 --> 00:43:21,966
Why did you kiss me?
I didn't give you my consent.

528
00:43:23,534 --> 00:43:24,401
I'm sorry.

529
00:43:24,468 --> 00:43:28,606
But, Ms. Klay,
you saw what happened, right?

530
00:43:28,672 --> 00:43:29,807
I did not mean to do it.

531
00:43:31,909 --> 00:43:34,445
But because of what happened,

532
00:43:34,511 --> 00:43:37,114
you have no choice but to marry me.

533
00:43:41,085 --> 00:43:41,952
Don't worry.

534
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:47,691
Because I am sure
that once we are married,

535
00:43:50,027 --> 00:43:52,429
Mrs. Fidel de los Reyes,

536
00:43:53,330 --> 00:43:55,466
you will eventually learn to love me.

537
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:57,134
Really?

538
00:43:59,737 --> 00:44:02,006
Why don't you marry this bouquet instead?

539
00:44:03,007 --> 00:44:03,874
But…

540
00:44:03,941 --> 00:44:05,643
Why don't you go home? It's okay.

541
00:44:05,709 --> 00:44:07,478
I'm all right now. Yes, I'm fine.

542
00:44:07,544 --> 00:44:09,446
You may go home.
You've reached your quota.

543
00:44:12,416 --> 00:44:13,584
Bye.

544
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:15,119
Bye.

545
00:44:24,428 --> 00:44:25,996
What a fool!

546
00:44:26,063 --> 00:44:29,099
He did comfort me.
But he also stole a kiss from me.

547
00:44:30,834 --> 00:44:33,003
I think he's planning to trick me
into marrying him.

548
00:44:34,238 --> 00:44:35,339
Don't forget your things!

549
00:44:35,406 --> 00:44:38,108
Oh, right. Thank you.

550
00:44:47,117 --> 00:44:48,185
This is your fault.

551
00:45:04,902 --> 00:45:07,738
I'm here to visit Maria, Father.

552
00:45:08,472 --> 00:45:10,808
But since you are here,

553
00:45:11,408 --> 00:45:15,713
I would like to take this opportunity
to reconcile with you.

554
00:45:17,147 --> 00:45:19,750
You should not have come here.

555
00:45:20,918 --> 00:45:25,656
Someone who is excommunicated like you

556
00:45:25,723 --> 00:45:29,793
has no right to face
my goddaughter or face me.

557
00:45:31,295 --> 00:45:33,163
Let's go, Crisostomo,
I will accompany you out.

558
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:34,798
No, Uncle.

559
00:45:34,865 --> 00:45:39,169
Because I have some important news
for you and for Maria.

560
00:45:39,236 --> 00:45:41,972
I did not expect
that the friar would be here.

561
00:45:42,039 --> 00:45:43,640
Even Don Tiburcio.

562
00:45:43,707 --> 00:45:48,879
This is my nephew, señor,

563
00:45:48,946 --> 00:45:53,650
Don Alfonso Linares,

564
00:45:53,717 --> 00:45:57,755
whom we have arranged with the friar

565
00:45:57,821 --> 00:46:00,691
to be Maria Clara's husband.

566
00:46:04,795 --> 00:46:07,164
What are you saying, señora?

567
00:46:08,298 --> 00:46:10,834
You heard what they said, didn't you?

568
00:46:15,405 --> 00:46:16,473
Maria…

569
00:46:17,407 --> 00:46:18,475
What is this?

570
00:46:19,409 --> 00:46:20,878
Are they telling the truth?

571
00:46:22,679 --> 00:46:25,215
Do you think we are kidding?

572
00:46:25,883 --> 00:46:27,284
Do you think

573
00:46:27,351 --> 00:46:31,522
I will allow you to marry
my goddaughter Maria Clara?

574
00:46:32,856 --> 00:46:34,224
It cannot be!

575
00:46:34,792 --> 00:46:37,394
That will never happen!

576
00:46:40,831 --> 00:46:46,870
I will never allow someone excommunicated
to destroy Maria's future.

577
00:46:50,374 --> 00:46:54,845
But I am no longer excommunicated
like what you are saying.

578
00:46:58,348 --> 00:47:00,284
Here. Read it.

579
00:47:01,018 --> 00:47:05,889
This letter came from
the honorable Archbishop himself.

580
00:47:23,974 --> 00:47:27,978
He has lifted the excommunication
that you imposed on me

581
00:47:28,045 --> 00:47:29,780
so I no longer see any reason

582
00:47:29,847 --> 00:47:33,750
for you to keep Maria away
and marry her off to someone else!

583
00:47:35,219 --> 00:47:39,089
Perhaps the Archbishop spoke
with the Captain General

584
00:47:39,156 --> 00:47:41,558
when he came to Manila

585
00:47:41,625 --> 00:47:43,360
and that's why he changed the decision.

586
00:47:44,661 --> 00:47:46,830
That is indeed what happened, Uncle.

587
00:47:48,966 --> 00:47:50,133
I don't care!

588
00:47:51,134 --> 00:47:54,204
I will still not allow you
to marry my goddaughter!

589
00:47:54,271 --> 00:47:56,406
My apologies, Father.

590
00:47:56,473 --> 00:47:58,075
I do not want to embarrass you,

591
00:47:59,009 --> 00:48:01,812
but what gives you the right to dictate
to Maria what she should do

592
00:48:01,879 --> 00:48:06,350
as if you are her father
when her real father is right here?

593
00:48:07,417 --> 00:48:08,719
That is enough!

594
00:48:08,785 --> 00:48:10,787
You really have no manners, Ibarra!

595
00:48:10,854 --> 00:48:13,090
You have no respect for our priest!

596
00:48:13,156 --> 00:48:14,858
Look, Maria!

597
00:48:14,925 --> 00:48:17,427
Is that the kind of man you want to marry?

598
00:48:19,329 --> 00:48:21,398
Crisostomo, come on.

599
00:48:21,999 --> 00:48:23,000
Please leave.

600
00:48:24,835 --> 00:48:26,103
Get out!

601
00:48:26,670 --> 00:48:28,505
He will not leave, Godfather.

602
00:48:31,341 --> 00:48:33,744
I still need to speak to my fiancé.

603
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:37,547
Did you hear that?

604
00:48:38,615 --> 00:48:44,021
So perhaps it is them you should
see out of your home, Uncle.

605
00:48:44,087 --> 00:48:44,988
You have no shame!

606
00:48:45,689 --> 00:48:46,990
-Father!
-Enough!

607
00:48:53,563 --> 00:48:54,531
Crisostomo!

608
00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:29,399
COMING UP…

609
00:49:29,466 --> 00:49:32,970
Ms. Klay, it seems that my friend
is serenading you.

610
00:49:33,036 --> 00:49:36,039
And I think my wish has come true.

611
00:49:36,106 --> 00:49:37,808
Here is the one who loves you.

612
00:49:41,178 --> 00:49:42,879
<i>We have made a decision.</i>

613
00:49:42,946 --> 00:49:44,514
<i>We will no longer delay it.</i>

614
00:49:44,581 --> 00:49:49,753
I will ask for Maria Clara's hand
so that we can already get married.

615
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:54,191
I think what you are asking
is impossible, my son.

616
00:49:54,257 --> 00:49:57,361
I don't want to put you at risk
but it's important that I talk to you.

617
00:49:57,928 --> 00:50:02,199
<i>It is time for me to use this.</i>

618
00:50:02,265 --> 00:50:04,901
Father, what do we need to talk about?

619
00:50:06,136 --> 00:50:07,337
Godfather?

620
00:50:07,971 --> 00:50:09,740
Why are you crying?

621
00:50:09,806 --> 00:50:12,309
Don't attempt to lie to me, Father.

622
00:50:12,376 --> 00:50:14,277
Especially since we are
in the house of God.

623
00:50:14,344 --> 00:50:16,680
You know the truth.

624
00:50:16,747 --> 00:50:19,583
So you better start confessing, Father.

625
00:50:26,890 --> 00:50:29,226
