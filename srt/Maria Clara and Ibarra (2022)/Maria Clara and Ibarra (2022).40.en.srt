1
00:00:28,395 --> 00:00:31,564
MARIA CLARA AND IBARRA

2
00:00:31,631 --> 00:00:35,568
THIS PROGRAM, WHICH IS ADAPTED
FROM THE NOVELS OF DR. JOSE P. RIZAL,

3
00:00:35,635 --> 00:00:40,473
IS PRESENTED USING DRAMATIC ELEMENTS
TO CONNECT THE PRESENT AND THE PAST

4
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:46,346
IN A SPECIAL REIMAGINING OF THE NATIONAL
LITERATURE FILIPINOS ARE PROUD OF.

5
00:00:46,413 --> 00:00:49,215
I will not get married
to the person you want for me.

6
00:00:49,282 --> 00:00:51,985
Instead, I will enter the convent.

7
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:53,453
My child, you don't know

8
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,856
the loneliness and suffering
that you will experience

9
00:00:56,923 --> 00:00:58,291
when you enter the convent.

10
00:00:58,358 --> 00:01:00,026
Don't tell me what to do.

11
00:01:00,093 --> 00:01:01,194
I am your father!

12
00:01:01,261 --> 00:01:03,263
I will never consider you my father.

13
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:07,500
You are the devil who raped my mother.

14
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:09,302
I have made my decision, Father.

15
00:01:09,369 --> 00:01:11,604
Convent or death?

16
00:01:11,671 --> 00:01:15,108
And I also know that she cannot hide
her anger toward her godfather.

17
00:01:15,175 --> 00:01:16,209
Why is that?

18
00:01:16,276 --> 00:01:19,012
I am just a messenger of the truth.

19
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:20,814
What truth?

20
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,850
You are not Maria's real father.

21
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:26,719
It's your dear friend, Father Damaso.

22
00:01:26,786 --> 00:01:28,254
PREVIOUSLY…

23
00:01:28,321 --> 00:01:32,325
Do you need to be at the convent
in Manila by tomorrow?

24
00:01:32,392 --> 00:01:34,527
I can't bear to stay
here any longer, Auntie.

25
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:36,629
I am just going to die
if I stay in this house.

26
00:01:36,696 --> 00:01:39,199
<i>Mr. Torres, do you know
where Ibarra really is?</i>

27
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:40,366
<i>Is he still alive?</i>

28
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:42,368
<i>You raised my hopes up.</i>

29
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:45,438
<i>You said I was able to change the story.
But what is this?</i>

30
00:01:45,505 --> 00:01:50,310
You are here to fully understand
the true meaning of the novel.

31
00:01:50,376 --> 00:01:51,277
Which is what?

32
00:01:51,344 --> 00:01:54,614
That we, Filipinos, are hopeless,
and so is our unfortunate nation?

33
00:01:54,681 --> 00:01:56,516
That no matter what we do,

34
00:01:56,583 --> 00:02:00,220
we will all die eventually?

35
00:02:05,492 --> 00:02:09,362
The curate is busy preparing
for his trip to Manila.

36
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,699
Then I will just come back
some other time.

37
00:02:14,501 --> 00:02:16,202
From the dear curate.

38
00:02:17,237 --> 00:02:18,705
Compensation for your service.

39
00:02:19,906 --> 00:02:24,010
And he said that you do not
need to seek him out again.

40
00:02:24,077 --> 00:02:29,249
Since Maria is already entering
the convent,

41
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:31,451
he does not need your assistance anymore.

42
00:02:32,452 --> 00:02:34,954
Your service ends here.

43
00:02:36,556 --> 00:02:38,391
<i>Report everything to me.</i>

44
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:41,928
<i>Including the conversations</i>
<i>between Maria Clara and Ibarra.</i>

45
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:44,063
<i>What news do you have for me?</i>

46
00:02:45,431 --> 00:02:47,667
You are fortunate to be free now.

47
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:53,072
Am I truly free?

48
00:02:55,241 --> 00:02:58,945
When my conscience will haunt me forever.

49
00:03:01,447 --> 00:03:02,982
And for what?

50
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:06,319
For some measly coins?

51
00:03:08,555 --> 00:03:11,457
For the safety of my unfortunate life?

52
00:03:12,725 --> 00:03:16,829
For the promise of
getting into heaven when I die?

53
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:22,769
Will I really get to heaven
after all my betrayals, Mr. Renato?

54
00:03:24,904 --> 00:03:30,210
Just thank God
that your anguish is over now.

55
00:03:32,946 --> 00:03:33,813
It's over.

56
00:03:36,115 --> 00:03:37,350
It's all over now…

57
00:03:39,986 --> 00:03:41,287
because of us.

58
00:03:43,957 --> 00:03:48,328
Because of us, Maria Clara
was separated from her beloved.

59
00:03:52,165 --> 00:03:53,466
Because of us…

60
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,170
Sir Crisostomo Ibarra died.

61
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:02,141
Because of us…

62
00:04:03,309 --> 00:04:05,445
the curate remains powerful.

63
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:16,155
It's my fault
that Clarita is now suffering.

64
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:20,426
The woman who considered me
part of her family, while I…

65
00:04:23,196 --> 00:04:25,565
I do not wish to keep you
away from your duties.

66
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:33,006
I only have one thing left to do…

67
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:37,243
I hope that it is not yet too late.

68
00:04:39,679 --> 00:04:41,614
May God forgive us all.

69
00:04:59,599 --> 00:05:00,967
I know that you are angry right now

70
00:05:01,734 --> 00:05:06,472
and I felt the same
after I first read <i>Noli.</i>

71
00:05:07,073 --> 00:05:07,907
Sir?

72
00:05:10,376 --> 00:05:11,244
The same?

73
00:05:12,178 --> 00:05:13,713
You felt the same?

74
00:05:17,717 --> 00:05:18,918
You…

75
00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:21,654
You only read it!

76
00:05:24,624 --> 00:05:26,326
But I experienced it.

77
00:05:29,028 --> 00:05:30,897
I lived in this world.

78
00:05:30,963 --> 00:05:32,398
I talked to them.

79
00:05:32,465 --> 00:05:34,600
I learned about all of their struggles.

80
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:39,272
I got to know them. I loved them.

81
00:05:40,406 --> 00:05:43,376
Sir, there's a difference!

82
00:05:43,943 --> 00:05:44,777
Klay.

83
00:05:47,246 --> 00:05:48,081
Klay.

84
00:05:51,751 --> 00:05:56,122
You are not the only one
who got affected by the novel.

85
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:57,557
Heed our plea!

86
00:05:57,623 --> 00:05:58,891
Heed our plea!

87
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:01,127
Heed our plea!

88
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:02,729
Heed our plea!

89
00:06:02,795 --> 00:06:04,130
Heed our plea!

90
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:05,898
Heed our plea!

91
00:06:06,499 --> 00:06:08,167
Hundreds of years ago…

92
00:06:09,602 --> 00:06:12,638
this novel ignited the revolution

93
00:06:13,406 --> 00:06:19,112
that aimed to evict the Spaniards

94
00:06:20,179 --> 00:06:25,852
who conquered our country
for more than 300 years.

95
00:06:30,156 --> 00:06:32,191
And whatever
you're feeling here right now…

96
00:06:34,093 --> 00:06:35,194
all the lessons

97
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:40,933
or love that you learned from <i>Noli,</i>

98
00:06:43,002 --> 00:06:43,836
I hope…

99
00:06:45,538 --> 00:06:47,340
that you carry those with you
back to our world

100
00:06:50,209 --> 00:06:51,744
and that it helps you…

101
00:06:53,379 --> 00:06:57,617
become a better citizen
who loves our country.

102
00:07:00,153 --> 00:07:01,821
Why are you talking that way?

103
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,925
It sounds like you are
wrapping up the class.

104
00:07:10,296 --> 00:07:11,297
Class is over.

105
00:07:12,865 --> 00:07:14,500
It's time to go home, Ms. Infantes.

106
00:07:15,301 --> 00:07:16,669
We're going home.

107
00:07:16,736 --> 00:07:17,570
Huh?

108
00:07:19,205 --> 00:07:21,040
We're going back to our world.

109
00:07:22,475 --> 00:07:24,277
This is where the story ends,

110
00:07:25,912 --> 00:07:29,315
including the role
that you played in the novel.

111
00:07:52,205 --> 00:07:54,307
-This is the end of the story.
-No.

112
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:58,044
That can't happen.

113
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:00,179
Sir, there are still many loose threads!

114
00:08:00,847 --> 00:08:02,882
Rizal ended the story here.

115
00:08:13,392 --> 00:08:14,560
Hold on.

116
00:08:16,462 --> 00:08:18,664
I still have a lot of questions.

117
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:22,468
Where is Ibarra?

118
00:08:23,736 --> 00:08:25,104
Is he still alive?

119
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:27,874
What about Maria Clara?
What will happen to Maria Clara?

120
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:29,976
Will the two still get back together?

121
00:08:36,048 --> 00:08:37,183
Basilio…

122
00:08:37,783 --> 00:08:39,785
What about Basilio? What will his fate be?

123
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,859
Will the revolt of the people
push through?

124
00:08:46,926 --> 00:08:48,995
Or will we forever submit
to those who rule over us?

125
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:51,797
And Fidel!

126
00:08:58,671 --> 00:09:00,907
Maybe all your questions will be answered

127
00:09:01,841 --> 00:09:03,509
in <i>El Filibusterismo.</i>

128
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:08,481
Okay.

129
00:09:09,615 --> 00:09:11,684
Okay, sir. Take me to <i>El Fili</i> now.

130
00:09:13,419 --> 00:09:14,320
That can't happen.

131
00:09:15,521 --> 00:09:17,823
You can only stay in <i>Noli.</i>

132
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:20,359
Your journey ends here in <i>Noli.</i>

133
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:23,329
Sir, you're so unfair.

134
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,231
This story is such a cliffhanger!

135
00:09:25,932 --> 00:09:26,832
Oh, then maybe…

136
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:32,338
you will now be eager
to read all of Rizal's novels

137
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:35,708
and other literary works
about our country's history.

138
00:09:36,876 --> 00:09:39,078
Sir, just tell me.

139
00:09:40,846 --> 00:09:43,316
Even just crumbs or even a few spoilers.

140
00:09:45,885 --> 00:09:47,920
Will there be a happy ending in <i>El Fili?</i>

141
00:09:49,722 --> 00:09:53,793
It's time to go home,
Ms. Maria Clara Infantes.

142
00:10:02,535 --> 00:10:03,836
What is this?

143
00:10:08,874 --> 00:10:11,677
Isn't this what you really want?

144
00:10:11,744 --> 00:10:15,915
To go back to our world
so you can be with your loved ones?

145
00:10:16,983 --> 00:10:18,217
That's right, sir.

146
00:10:19,518 --> 00:10:21,754
But does it really have to be now?

147
00:10:21,821 --> 00:10:22,888
Like, right now?

148
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:25,891
Why? What is it again?

149
00:11:10,803 --> 00:11:13,172
Sir, is it possible…

150
00:11:15,574 --> 00:11:18,077
Is it possible for me to have closure

151
00:11:18,144 --> 00:11:22,214
with the people I met here
and with this town?

152
00:11:26,118 --> 00:11:27,319
With Lucia,

153
00:11:28,988 --> 00:11:30,156
Fidel,

154
00:11:34,927 --> 00:11:36,128
and the town of San Diego.

155
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:46,772
We are truly friends now.

156
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:54,046
Maria Clara…

157
00:11:55,781 --> 00:11:57,717
I need to talk to Maria Clara.

158
00:11:57,783 --> 00:12:01,253
I can't leave this world
without saying goodbye to her.

159
00:12:08,961 --> 00:12:10,262
Very well.

160
00:12:10,329 --> 00:12:11,931
I am giving you an hour.

161
00:12:11,997 --> 00:12:12,832
Huh?

162
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:14,300
Only an hour?

163
00:12:14,366 --> 00:12:15,835
Sir, I'm so far from town.

164
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:17,636
There are no taxi cabs here.

165
00:12:17,703 --> 00:12:20,206
Maybe you can give me an extension?

166
00:12:20,272 --> 00:12:23,008
Where do you think we are?
A computer shop, Ms. Infantes?

167
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:24,143
Sir, please.

168
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:25,678
This is my last favor,

169
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:27,546
and it's almost nighttime.

170
00:12:27,613 --> 00:12:30,382
We're on the town's list of wanted people.
And there's a curfew too!

171
00:12:30,449 --> 00:12:32,685
I really won't be able
to get there on time.

172
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:35,121
Please, sir. Give me until tomorrow.

173
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:38,758
I think you know I deserve that closure.

174
00:12:39,358 --> 00:12:40,359
I will give you…

175
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:44,396
until sunset tomorrow.

176
00:12:45,664 --> 00:12:47,500
But you really need to go back home.

177
00:12:47,566 --> 00:12:50,669
Twenty-four hours should be enough.

178
00:12:51,637 --> 00:12:54,807
Remember, when sundown comes tomorrow…

179
00:12:54,874 --> 00:12:56,509
whether you like it or not…

180
00:12:58,677 --> 00:13:01,147
you will hear the toll
of the church bell again.

181
00:13:02,414 --> 00:13:04,517
The sound of the church bell
that only I can hear?

182
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:09,955
Finished or not finished, time's up.

183
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:14,794
You will be swallowed up by the portal
back to our world.

184
00:13:17,897 --> 00:13:20,699
Hurry up. Time is ticking.

185
00:13:34,513 --> 00:13:36,282
You're Ali?

186
00:13:42,688 --> 00:13:44,256
Right.

187
00:13:45,424 --> 00:13:48,260
So that's why you always know where I am

188
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:50,563
and what's happening to me.

189
00:14:03,142 --> 00:14:06,045
I've shared many moments with you.

190
00:14:09,281 --> 00:14:11,917
Oh, you're driving me crazy, Mr. Torres.

191
00:14:22,127 --> 00:14:23,662
I only have until tomorrow.

192
00:14:35,241 --> 00:14:36,108
Santiago.

193
00:14:37,843 --> 00:14:39,144
What do you need from me?

194
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:52,691
What is this disrespect? Huh?

195
00:14:52,758 --> 00:14:54,526
Do I have no respect, Father?

196
00:14:56,695 --> 00:15:00,499
Be thankful that's the only thing
I did to you.

197
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,401
Come to think of it,

198
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:06,939
it is much better if I just kill you!

199
00:15:09,475 --> 00:15:11,210
Who told you?

200
00:15:12,611 --> 00:15:14,914
Who told me?

201
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:17,850
That someone I considered a good friend,

202
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:19,952
a holy friar,

203
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,388
is actually…

204
00:15:23,455 --> 00:15:24,523
a traitor!

205
00:15:25,024 --> 00:15:29,361
A devil pretending to be holy
who must be despised!

206
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,168
You know

207
00:15:37,169 --> 00:15:40,039
how much I love my wife.

208
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:44,376
That is why I did not remarry
after she died.

209
00:15:47,546 --> 00:15:49,248
And you also know

210
00:15:50,683 --> 00:15:53,252
how much I loved who I thought was…

211
00:15:54,219 --> 00:15:56,021
my only daughter.

212
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:59,925
Turns out Maria Clara is not my child!

213
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:05,397
She is the child
of a blasphemous man like you!

214
00:16:08,534 --> 00:16:10,703
I used to respect you.

215
00:16:10,769 --> 00:16:14,039
Do you know the punishment for lying?

216
00:16:16,608 --> 00:16:20,779
I became submissive to your every whim.

217
00:16:21,613 --> 00:16:24,683
Even if I looked like a fool.

218
00:16:26,552 --> 00:16:28,187
I never thought…

219
00:16:29,088 --> 00:16:33,025
that you would destroy my family,

220
00:16:36,128 --> 00:16:38,397
my reputation,

221
00:16:39,631 --> 00:16:43,135
and my deceased wife's honor!

222
00:16:43,202 --> 00:16:44,937
Pia, who you violated!

223
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:46,672
You animal!

224
00:16:46,739 --> 00:16:49,074
You animal!

225
00:16:57,249 --> 00:17:00,252
Even if you kill me now, Santiago,

226
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:05,224
you will not gain anything anymore.

227
00:17:08,961 --> 00:17:10,729
What happened has already happened.

228
00:17:11,497 --> 00:17:13,866
It is not right

229
00:17:13,932 --> 00:17:17,803
to end your suffering.

230
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:20,739
You must be cursed.

231
00:17:20,806 --> 00:17:25,978
May God curse you to live a long life

232
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:29,615
filled with misery!

233
00:17:29,681 --> 00:17:32,885
A life that is filled
with regret and suffering!

234
00:17:34,086 --> 00:17:35,054
Amen.

235
00:18:01,346 --> 00:18:03,549
Oh, come on.

236
00:18:03,615 --> 00:18:05,451
There is no water.

237
00:18:22,868 --> 00:18:23,702
Miss…

238
00:18:33,011 --> 00:18:34,780
Thank you.

239
00:18:41,019 --> 00:18:42,454
Klay…

240
00:18:42,521 --> 00:18:46,125
How is your search for our friend going?

241
00:18:48,894 --> 00:18:50,229
I found someone else.

242
00:18:52,831 --> 00:18:53,999
I know…

243
00:18:55,167 --> 00:18:57,035
you were talking to someone earlier.

244
00:19:00,038 --> 00:19:02,908
I apologize for following you.

245
00:19:03,876 --> 00:19:04,910
Did you see him?

246
00:19:06,078 --> 00:19:07,546
Who?

247
00:19:08,347 --> 00:19:09,882
Mr. Torres.

248
00:19:10,449 --> 00:19:12,151
The one who turned into a firefly?

249
00:19:12,217 --> 00:19:13,785
It's crazy, right?

250
00:19:16,054 --> 00:19:19,791
I don't know
who you are referring to, miss.

251
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:22,561
I did not see anybody else earlier.

252
00:19:22,628 --> 00:19:26,632
Even just crumbs or even a few spoilers.

253
00:19:28,267 --> 00:19:30,769
Will there be a happy ending in <i>El Fili?</i>

254
00:19:31,603 --> 00:19:33,739
Okay, sir. Take me to <i>El Fili</i> now.

255
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:38,277
You only seem to be talking
to yourself in the woods.

256
00:19:39,111 --> 00:19:40,379
You didn't see anyone?

257
00:19:42,581 --> 00:19:44,082
Wait, are you…

258
00:19:44,149 --> 00:19:45,851
are you getting delirious from hunger?

259
00:19:50,222 --> 00:19:51,823
And…

260
00:19:54,159 --> 00:19:56,161
did I hear it right?

261
00:19:57,996 --> 00:19:59,498
That it's your last day tomorrow?

262
00:20:05,571 --> 00:20:07,072
I only have until tomorrow.

263
00:20:11,176 --> 00:20:14,046
What did you mean by that?

264
00:20:15,147 --> 00:20:15,981
Fidel…

265
00:20:23,855 --> 00:20:25,724
I have to go to town first thing tomorrow.

266
00:20:28,026 --> 00:20:30,062
I know it is difficult and
dangerous to go back there

267
00:20:30,128 --> 00:20:32,030
but I must speak to Maria Clara.

268
00:20:33,665 --> 00:20:35,834
Will you come with me?

269
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:05,264
Cousin…

270
00:21:06,331 --> 00:21:08,333
Andeng said she was leaving.

271
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,435
She's already packing her things.

272
00:21:11,003 --> 00:21:15,274
She didn't give any reason
why she was leaving.

273
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:17,976
Can you hear me, cousin?

274
00:21:18,043 --> 00:21:19,111
What?

275
00:21:19,177 --> 00:21:21,880
Should I call Andeng now
so that you can talk to her?

276
00:21:23,982 --> 00:21:27,486
If she wants to leave, then let her.

277
00:21:28,487 --> 00:21:29,554
What?

278
00:21:30,756 --> 00:21:33,592
You can't stop someone
from doing what they want,

279
00:21:35,327 --> 00:21:38,430
no matter how good you've been to them.

280
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:40,866
In the end,

281
00:21:42,067 --> 00:21:44,436
they will still leave
and turn their back on you.

282
00:21:45,537 --> 00:21:48,473
What's happening to you?

283
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:50,375
What are you talking about?

284
00:21:53,745 --> 00:21:55,080
Are you drunk?

285
00:21:59,184 --> 00:22:01,219
Where's Maria?

286
00:22:01,286 --> 00:22:04,489
She's packing up her things
for the convent.

287
00:22:49,267 --> 00:22:50,135
Maria…

288
00:22:54,806 --> 00:22:56,508
It seems that no one can stop you now.

289
00:22:57,843 --> 00:22:59,845
Are you going to enter the convent?

290
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:06,017
Tomorrow, I hope that you
and Auntie Isabel

291
00:23:06,084 --> 00:23:08,453
will take me to the monastery.

292
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:12,424
You're leaving me?

293
00:23:14,092 --> 00:23:16,528
Once you enter the convent,

294
00:23:16,595 --> 00:23:18,897
I won't see you ever again.

295
00:23:18,964 --> 00:23:19,865
You know that.

296
00:23:26,104 --> 00:23:28,173
I'm sorry, Father.

297
00:23:29,674 --> 00:23:32,110
It's the only way I can think of…

298
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:35,614
to save myself.

299
00:23:39,451 --> 00:23:43,355
It hurts to be separated
from you and Auntie Isabel.

300
00:23:46,224 --> 00:23:51,730
But no one else can take away the pain
that I'm feeling, except for the Lord.

301
00:23:53,698 --> 00:23:56,301
I need to find myself first.

302
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:07,946
I know that I have a lot
of shortcomings as your father.

303
00:24:09,514 --> 00:24:11,683
I have a lot of regrets.

304
00:24:14,586 --> 00:24:20,692
I didn't fight harder
for your relationship with Crisostomo.

305
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:25,497
I thought of myself first
instead of your happiness.

306
00:24:27,833 --> 00:24:32,137
I pushed you to do things
that you didn't want to do.

307
00:24:34,172 --> 00:24:35,707
Forgive me.

308
00:24:40,345 --> 00:24:44,649
I understand why you had to do that.

309
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:47,219
But I wish…

310
00:24:47,285 --> 00:24:49,721
I wish that I did more for you.

311
00:24:49,788 --> 00:24:52,090
I wish that I had been stronger.

312
00:24:56,995 --> 00:24:58,763
It is not right…

313
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:04,269
for you to have a father
who is weak like me.

314
00:25:09,474 --> 00:25:10,308
Father…

315
00:25:11,576 --> 00:25:13,278
don't say that.

316
00:25:14,746 --> 00:25:18,750
You did so much for me.

317
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:22,888
I could not ask for more.

318
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:29,961
Despite everything…

319
00:25:31,296 --> 00:25:34,666
I am truly thankful
that I have a daughter like you.

320
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:39,538
You are a great blessing
in my life, Maria Clara.

321
00:25:40,772 --> 00:25:44,843
You became my light and my strength
when your mother died.

322
00:25:50,482 --> 00:25:53,852
You are the reason
why I wake up every day.

323
00:25:55,754 --> 00:25:58,156
I love you so much, my child.

324
00:25:58,223 --> 00:26:00,258
I love you so much.

325
00:26:01,293 --> 00:26:03,261
I love you too, Father.

326
00:26:25,116 --> 00:26:28,186
Ms. Klay, someone might see us here.

327
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:29,921
People are searching for us.

328
00:26:30,488 --> 00:26:32,157
I just need to talk to Maria Clara.

329
00:26:32,223 --> 00:26:34,826
After that, we can <i>gorabels</i>. I promise.

330
00:26:34,893 --> 00:26:36,161
<i>"Gorabels"?</i>

331
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:39,364
Andeng?

332
00:26:40,365 --> 00:26:41,700
Is that you?

333
00:26:44,069 --> 00:26:45,303
Where's Maria Clara?

334
00:26:50,342 --> 00:26:51,876
You're leaving?

335
00:26:54,245 --> 00:26:56,014
I hurt her.

336
00:26:57,482 --> 00:26:59,084
I hurt my sister.

337
00:27:03,321 --> 00:27:05,056
Why would you be hurting each other?

338
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:09,160
You love each other, right?

339
00:27:09,227 --> 00:27:11,696
Friends, family…

340
00:27:11,763 --> 00:27:13,832
That's what you are to each other.

341
00:27:15,667 --> 00:27:17,736
But despite all that…

342
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:20,472
what did I do?

343
00:27:22,273 --> 00:27:23,942
Unlike you, Klay…

344
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:29,014
Despite having been kicked out
of their house,

345
00:27:30,782 --> 00:27:32,817
you never turned your back on her.

346
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:37,155
You opened her eyes to different things,

347
00:27:37,222 --> 00:27:40,959
even if everyone tells her
she should turn a blind eye.

348
00:27:41,026 --> 00:27:42,027
Come here!

349
00:27:42,861 --> 00:27:44,262
-Stop it!
-Godfather, godfather…

350
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:45,930
Godfather, forgive me!

351
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:47,198
Let go of her, please!

352
00:27:47,265 --> 00:27:50,502
It's right for that snake
to be removed from your household

353
00:27:50,568 --> 00:27:52,037
before she can even strike.

354
00:27:52,103 --> 00:27:53,371
Why?

355
00:27:53,438 --> 00:27:55,640
But I do not want to lose her.

356
00:27:55,707 --> 00:27:58,843
<i>You cannot trust</i>
<i>the woman that you took in</i>

357
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:03,581
because she can use this opportunity

358
00:28:03,648 --> 00:28:05,950
to steal the man you love away from you.

359
00:28:07,252 --> 00:28:10,889
I know that Ms. Klay

360
00:28:10,955 --> 00:28:15,060
<i>is a good person and she would not do
something like that.</i>

361
00:28:21,232 --> 00:28:25,370
She learned to stand
on her own two feet because of you.

362
00:28:27,439 --> 00:28:29,974
Even if other people say
that she is not capable of doing so.

363
00:28:30,742 --> 00:28:32,544
It's because of you, Klay.

364
00:28:34,345 --> 00:28:36,314
You are a true friend.

365
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:42,187
Even if you put yourself in danger,

366
00:28:42,253 --> 00:28:46,257
you will still do everything
to make Maria Clara happy.

367
00:28:47,926 --> 00:28:49,027
You are loyal.

368
00:28:51,996 --> 00:28:53,164
Unlike me

369
00:28:54,666 --> 00:28:56,301
who is a coward and a traitor.

370
00:28:58,069 --> 00:29:01,272
I did not take our friendship
into consideration

371
00:29:03,608 --> 00:29:05,210
because I let fear take over.

372
00:29:09,447 --> 00:29:12,650
Andeng, I don't understand.
Can you tell me what really happened?

373
00:29:21,726 --> 00:29:26,931
It's people like you
who can give her strength and hope

374
00:29:26,998 --> 00:29:28,833
while she is going through
this difficult time.

375
00:29:34,572 --> 00:29:36,407
-I'm going now.
-Wait.

376
00:29:37,175 --> 00:29:38,343
Where are you going?

377
00:29:39,744 --> 00:29:42,313
I need to go far away.

378
00:29:43,715 --> 00:29:46,618
I must repent for everything I have done.

379
00:29:49,354 --> 00:29:52,457
Please take care of Maria Clara, Klay.

380
00:29:53,691 --> 00:29:57,662
Never abandon my beloved sister.

381
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:35,967
Maria…

382
00:30:40,038 --> 00:30:41,606
Oh, my friend.

383
00:30:45,643 --> 00:30:47,645
My poor friend.

384
00:30:51,549 --> 00:30:53,585
Oh, dear friend.

385
00:31:01,192 --> 00:31:02,227
Maria,

386
00:31:03,895 --> 00:31:06,431
please pray for us, all right?

387
00:31:06,497 --> 00:31:08,600
Oh, what is the matter with you?

388
00:31:08,666 --> 00:31:12,070
We all know that's the only thing
she will do there.

389
00:31:13,805 --> 00:31:17,642
Just inform us or send us a letter

390
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:20,011
in case you change your mind.

391
00:31:20,812 --> 00:31:22,881
We will fetch you there, my friend.

392
00:31:27,252 --> 00:31:31,623
We will never forget the times
we spent together, dear friend.

393
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:52,644
Thank you very much.

394
00:31:56,014 --> 00:31:57,282
Well…

395
00:31:58,483 --> 00:32:00,018
we need to go.

396
00:32:03,221 --> 00:32:08,026
We hope to reach Manila before sunrise.

397
00:32:23,141 --> 00:32:24,175
Maria Clara.

398
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:29,881
Klay?

399
00:32:33,885 --> 00:32:38,056
If you want to exchange goodbyes…

400
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:40,825
I will not stop you from doing so.

401
00:32:48,533 --> 00:32:50,068
My namesake…

402
00:33:01,512 --> 00:33:02,780
Hold on.

403
00:33:02,847 --> 00:33:04,248
What's going on?

404
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:08,519
Where are you going?
Why are you all crying?

405
00:33:10,388 --> 00:33:13,591
I do not know the reason
why they are crying, but…

406
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:17,695
I have decided to become a nun.

407
00:33:18,429 --> 00:33:19,430
A nun?

408
00:33:20,531 --> 00:33:21,599
Why?

409
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:24,869
What about your wedding with Sir Ibarra?

410
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:29,907
Have you not heard the news, Klay?

411
00:33:37,782 --> 00:33:39,484
It's fake news.

412
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:41,719
What you heard is wrong.

413
00:33:42,754 --> 00:33:44,689
Sir Ibarra is not dead.

414
00:33:45,823 --> 00:33:47,692
What are you saying, Klay?

415
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:52,730
The body that was found in the forest

416
00:33:52,797 --> 00:33:54,532
was not Sir Ibarra's.

417
00:33:55,633 --> 00:33:56,467
It was…

418
00:33:56,534 --> 00:33:59,404
Elias' and Sisa's.

419
00:34:02,106 --> 00:34:07,412
That's the rumor around in the woods,
and that's my prediction too.

420
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:13,084
But I'm sure that one of them is Sisa.

421
00:34:16,754 --> 00:34:18,790
Another prediction, Klay?

422
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:23,761
Just like what you told me before.

423
00:34:24,362 --> 00:34:26,130
Tell me the truth.

424
00:34:27,331 --> 00:34:31,469
Do you know what will happen
to me and Crisostomo?

425
00:34:35,706 --> 00:34:36,674
Señorita…

426
00:34:44,882 --> 00:34:46,984
My God…

427
00:34:48,786 --> 00:34:49,954
That the friars are evil.

428
00:34:50,021 --> 00:34:52,023
Father Damaso is not a good person.

429
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:54,792
He might even be in cahoots
with that bald priest.

430
00:34:54,859 --> 00:34:56,661
Father Salvi.

431
00:34:56,727 --> 00:34:58,329
I think the two of them are the ones

432
00:34:58,396 --> 00:35:00,932
who want to have your fiancé killed.

433
00:35:00,998 --> 00:35:04,001
That Crisostomo and I
will have many problems.

434
00:35:04,669 --> 00:35:08,172
There will be a feast
at your house, Maria Clara.

435
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:10,641
If I'm not mistaken,

436
00:35:10,708 --> 00:35:14,245
that's when you and your fiancé,
Crisostomo Ibarra,

437
00:35:14,312 --> 00:35:17,148
will start having problems.

438
00:35:17,882 --> 00:35:20,685
That we are merely characters in a story.

439
00:35:20,751 --> 00:35:25,790
Just like the book you read.
Just like Jean Valjean…

440
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:30,595
you are also a character in a novel.

441
00:35:30,661 --> 00:35:34,932
When you think about it,
all of them came true.

442
00:35:40,338 --> 00:35:46,944
And basing it on
the cruel events in my life…

443
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:53,251
I really seem to be
like a character in a novel.

444
00:35:54,785 --> 00:35:58,356
Just like the novels we discussed before.

445
00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:11,235
You became a real person
to me, Maria Clara.

446
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:17,675
You became a true friend.

447
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:21,212
You and Sir Ibarra.

448
00:36:26,117 --> 00:36:28,819
Crisostomo Ibarra…

449
00:36:30,655 --> 00:36:32,890
whom you are saying is still alive.

450
00:36:36,561 --> 00:36:38,629
Where is he now?

451
00:36:40,631 --> 00:36:42,233
Do you know where he is?

452
00:36:54,845 --> 00:36:56,447
We are still looking for him.

453
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:58,849
Promise, we will look for him.

454
00:37:00,484 --> 00:37:03,221
We just haven't found him yet.

455
00:37:03,788 --> 00:37:06,490
But if it is true that
Crisostomo is alive…

456
00:37:08,859 --> 00:37:10,528
he will come back for me.

457
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:15,766
He will visit me or write to me.

458
00:37:17,335 --> 00:37:20,871
Especially since he knows
about the news of his death.

459
00:37:23,374 --> 00:37:26,711
And I know that he knows
that I cannot bear it.

460
00:37:27,878 --> 00:37:30,181
What kind of joke is this again, Klay?

461
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:33,417
I don't know…

462
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,455
I don't know.

463
00:37:38,656 --> 00:37:40,992
But I believe

464
00:37:41,058 --> 00:37:42,760
that he will come back.

465
00:37:43,728 --> 00:37:44,762
He will come back for you.

466
00:37:46,397 --> 00:37:50,368
I won't put my hopes up anymore, Klay.

467
00:37:52,803 --> 00:37:55,039
I am dwindling…

468
00:37:55,873 --> 00:37:57,375
I am so done.

469
00:38:00,144 --> 00:38:02,713
Which is why I need peace.

470
00:38:04,982 --> 00:38:07,952
I need to stay at the convent for now.

471
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:16,961
God will do as He may with me.

472
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:22,466
Perhaps I will wait for him there.

473
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:27,705
Or I don't know…

474
00:38:33,044 --> 00:38:35,046
I might be waiting for nothing.

475
00:38:36,514 --> 00:38:39,183
Are you really going to the convent?

476
00:38:41,519 --> 00:38:42,887
I chose this.

477
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:49,460
At last…

478
00:38:50,861 --> 00:38:52,897
no one was able to stop me.

479
00:39:01,205 --> 00:39:03,307
Then there's also nothing I can do.

480
00:39:06,644 --> 00:39:08,913
I also need to go home,

481
00:39:10,481 --> 00:39:11,816
my namesake.

482
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:27,798
Time is running out, my namesake.

483
00:39:30,835 --> 00:39:35,639
If only we can be together longer,

484
00:39:37,942 --> 00:39:43,147
but we need to pursue the paths
that we have chosen.

485
00:39:45,516 --> 00:39:46,717
Wait…

486
00:39:48,786 --> 00:39:50,955
Maria Clara, what if…

487
00:39:52,156 --> 00:39:55,726
What if you don't enter the convent?

488
00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:04,402
If you can decide for yourself
and no one can stop you now,

489
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:07,538
would you like to come with me?

490
00:40:11,642 --> 00:40:12,576
Where?

491
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:18,716
To my world, Maria Clara.

492
00:40:53,083 --> 00:40:54,652
AS NOLI ME TANGERE COMES TO AN END

493
00:40:54,718 --> 00:40:56,253
<i>Where are we going, sir?</i>

494
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,122
<i>We will leave this town for now.</i>

495
00:40:58,189 --> 00:41:01,926
<i>Thank you very much for valuing me, Fidel.</i>

496
00:41:01,992 --> 00:41:04,295
But I need to go.

497
00:41:04,361 --> 00:41:06,831
What are you saying, Ms. Klay?

498
00:41:06,897 --> 00:41:08,032
<i>Klay, what world?</i>

499
00:41:08,098 --> 00:41:11,602
<i>The year 2022.</i>

500
00:41:12,102 --> 00:41:13,070
Mr. Torres,

501
00:41:13,137 --> 00:41:15,473
I know what will happen
to the characters in <i>El Fili.</i>

502
00:41:15,539 --> 00:41:17,374
<i>I have read the book.</i>

503
00:41:17,441 --> 00:41:18,476
<i>But now, Mr. Torres,</i>

504
00:41:18,542 --> 00:41:20,544
<i>I need to go back.</i>

505
00:41:20,611 --> 00:41:23,047
<i>I need to save the characters
in the story.</i>

506
00:41:23,113 --> 00:41:24,882
COMING UP…

507
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:35,426
