1
00:00:28,294 --> 00:00:31,097
MARIA CLARA AND IBARRA

2
00:00:31,164 --> 00:00:35,135
THIS PROGRAM, WHICH IS ADAPTED
FROM THE NOVELS OF DR. JOSE P. RIZAL,

3
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:40,173
IS PRESENTED USING DRAMATIC ELEMENTS
TO CONNECT THE PRESENT AND THE PAST

4
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:45,945
IN A SPECIAL REIMAGINING OF THE NATIONAL
LITERATURE FILIPINOS ARE PROUD OF.

5
00:00:46,446 --> 00:00:50,016
<i>I heard Señor Ibarra
has been excommunicated.</i>

6
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:53,119
<i>What will happen to poor Maria Clara now?</i>

7
00:00:53,186 --> 00:00:57,190
Señor alferez, I came here
to ask for your help

8
00:00:57,257 --> 00:00:58,992
so I can meet with the Captain General.

9
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:01,027
<i>I'm going to need his help</i>

10
00:01:01,094 --> 00:01:05,532
<i>so the friars and the church
won't condemn me.</i>

11
00:01:05,598 --> 00:01:09,002
I will talk to the archbishop
about your excommunication.

12
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:11,971
<i>I'm confident I can convince him</i>

13
00:01:12,038 --> 00:01:14,674
<i>that the punishment given to you
was unreasonable.</i>

14
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:16,509
<i>Thanks for the cheese.</i>

15
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:18,311
<i>But your friend is not here.</i>

16
00:01:18,378 --> 00:01:20,547
<i>Miss Klay. Are you blind?</i>

17
00:01:20,613 --> 00:01:23,917
<i>-Or are you just insensitive?
-What do you mean?</i>

18
00:01:23,983 --> 00:01:26,052
<i>I love you, Miss Klay.</i>

19
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:26,953
<i>Good morning.</i>

20
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:29,789
<i>Especially to you, Doña Maria Clara.</i>

21
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:33,927
<i>I want to pair up Alfonso
with Maria Clara.</i>

22
00:01:33,993 --> 00:01:35,628
Pair us up, Godfather?

23
00:01:35,695 --> 00:01:37,597
You are truly very beautiful.

24
00:01:37,664 --> 00:01:40,733
<i>I understand what you're trying
to say with that fan.</i>

25
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,469
<i>You already have a fiancé.</i>

26
00:01:43,136 --> 00:01:46,206
<i>My Maria Clara is not interested, Alfonso.</i>

27
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:48,708
How dare you come here?

28
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:50,944
I am here to visit Maria, Father.

29
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:54,681
An agreement
has been reached with the friar

30
00:01:54,747 --> 00:01:57,917
that Alfonso and Maria Clara
are to be wed.

31
00:01:57,984 --> 00:02:03,623
An excommunicated like you
will not destroy Maria's future!

32
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:06,860
<i>The excommunication
you imposed on me has been lifted.</i>

33
00:02:06,926 --> 00:02:11,097
<i>You do not have any more reason
to keep Maria away from me</i>

34
00:02:11,164 --> 00:02:12,565
<i>and marry her off to someone else!</i>

35
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:14,801
I don't care!

36
00:02:14,868 --> 00:02:18,805
What right do you have to dictate
to Maria as if you are her father?

37
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:20,206
How dare you!

38
00:02:20,907 --> 00:02:22,775
-Father!
-Leave!

39
00:02:26,513 --> 00:02:28,748
PREVIOUSLY…

40
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:30,650
I do not intend to hurt you, señor.

41
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:33,486
But I don't regret it either.

42
00:02:34,387 --> 00:02:35,855
That's enough.

43
00:02:36,856 --> 00:02:37,824
Enough, señor.

44
00:02:39,592 --> 00:02:40,760
You may leave.

45
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:47,534
Godfather.

46
00:02:49,469 --> 00:02:51,171
Godfather, please.

47
00:02:51,237 --> 00:02:52,405
I beg of you.

48
00:02:53,907 --> 00:02:55,909
Don't make me suffer anymore.

49
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:01,347
Santiago.

50
00:03:02,448 --> 00:03:05,919
Talk some sense to Maria.

51
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,422
And you, Señor Ibarra.

52
00:03:10,256 --> 00:03:13,426
Just because you know the Captain General

53
00:03:13,493 --> 00:03:15,662
does not mean you're above me!

54
00:03:17,297 --> 00:03:20,233
It's not over, señor.

55
00:03:48,328 --> 00:03:50,997
You have infuriated
the friar again, Crisostomo.

56
00:03:54,167 --> 00:03:55,802
My apologies, Uncle.

57
00:03:56,302 --> 00:03:58,972
I did not expect he would be here

58
00:03:59,038 --> 00:04:03,309
along with the gentleman
who will take my place…

59
00:04:05,044 --> 00:04:07,247
as Maria's fiancé.

60
00:04:07,814 --> 00:04:09,015
Father, Auntie.

61
00:04:10,216 --> 00:04:12,785
Can you please leave us to talk?

62
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,188
Please?

63
00:04:16,856 --> 00:04:19,125
Cousin, watch them.

64
00:04:20,226 --> 00:04:21,327
-Yes.
-Maria.

65
00:04:21,894 --> 00:04:23,296
Let's talk some other time.

66
00:04:31,904 --> 00:04:34,307
Don't look at me like that.

67
00:04:35,908 --> 00:04:38,544
I do not wish to fight against my cousin.

68
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,048
All right, then.

69
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:47,754
I will move farther away
so I won't hear your conversation.

70
00:05:05,338 --> 00:05:08,041
Maria, I was not gone for too long

71
00:05:08,675 --> 00:05:12,045
and now you are set to marry another man.

72
00:05:13,112 --> 00:05:16,883
Do you think I would agree to it?

73
00:05:22,555 --> 00:05:25,858
What a relief to hear you say that.

74
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:30,229
But what if they insist?

75
00:05:30,296 --> 00:05:34,033
Do you think I will let that happen?

76
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:38,938
Your father will talk to you later.

77
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:44,544
I am sure he will persuade you
to think I do not deserve you.

78
00:05:45,111 --> 00:05:46,679
I know your father.

79
00:05:46,746 --> 00:05:50,016
He follows everything the friars want.

80
00:05:51,217 --> 00:05:53,252
If you follow in his steps…

81
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:58,091
Don't worry about the impossible.

82
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,362
I want you, Crisostomo.

83
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:07,934
You're the only one I want to marry.

84
00:06:16,342 --> 00:06:18,411
I feel the same way about you, my love.

85
00:06:19,412 --> 00:06:21,114
I don't want to waste any more time.

86
00:06:22,815 --> 00:06:25,051
I don't care what your godfather says.

87
00:06:26,619 --> 00:06:29,422
We're going to fulfill our fathers' wishes

88
00:06:29,989 --> 00:06:31,691
as soon as possible.

89
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:35,595
I will prepare a proper wedding proposal.

90
00:06:38,131 --> 00:06:39,532
Crisostomo.

91
00:06:41,467 --> 00:06:44,070
I'm going to formally ask
your father for your hand

92
00:06:44,137 --> 00:06:45,838
so we can finally get married.

93
00:06:48,608 --> 00:06:50,676
Will you let me, Maria?

94
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,482
Yes, with all my heart.

95
00:07:44,597 --> 00:07:47,934
Our love is bound together
by prayers, my love.

96
00:07:51,504 --> 00:07:53,172
Promise me.

97
00:07:54,006 --> 00:07:57,477
You will hold on to our love.

98
00:07:58,945 --> 00:08:01,080
And to that rosary too.

99
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:11,991
I promise, my love.

100
00:08:12,758 --> 00:08:13,860
I promise.

101
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:02,308
Annoying.

102
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,876
The audacity.

103
00:09:05,144 --> 00:09:06,812
God, he's annoying!

104
00:09:09,282 --> 00:09:11,651
Who are you mad at this time, Miss Klay?

105
00:09:13,619 --> 00:09:16,055
I'm mad at the people
I've encountered today.

106
00:09:16,122 --> 00:09:19,492
Don't ask. I don't want any trouble.

107
00:09:20,626 --> 00:09:22,828
Why? What happened to you today?

108
00:09:44,016 --> 00:09:45,651
Forget it, sir.

109
00:09:45,718 --> 00:09:48,421
As long as it doesn't concern you,

110
00:09:48,487 --> 00:09:49,488
never mind.

111
00:09:52,024 --> 00:09:53,659
How was your trip?

112
00:09:53,726 --> 00:09:56,362
Were you able to talk
to Señorita Maria Clara?

113
00:10:00,132 --> 00:10:01,267
<i>Maria.</i>

114
00:10:01,867 --> 00:10:03,402
Come, let's talk.

115
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:15,615
Father, if this is about Godfather…

116
00:10:17,483 --> 00:10:19,185
I want you to know

117
00:10:19,251 --> 00:10:23,422
that I will not marry that man
he is setting me up with.

118
00:10:24,557 --> 00:10:27,560
Crisostomo is the only man I want.

119
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:30,296
Cousin.

120
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:33,099
Don't you feel sorry for your daughter?

121
00:10:33,165 --> 00:10:37,069
How will she deal with a man
she does not love?

122
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:39,572
I do not think this is right.

123
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:44,477
What can I do?
The friar has made his decision.

124
00:10:44,543 --> 00:10:47,380
Crisostomo made him
really furious this time.

125
00:10:48,681 --> 00:10:52,184
Do you think he will let you two wed?

126
00:10:52,752 --> 00:10:54,186
Really, sir?

127
00:10:54,787 --> 00:10:58,124
They are setting up another man
for Señorita Maria Clara?

128
00:10:58,190 --> 00:10:59,358
He's a Spaniard.

129
00:10:59,859 --> 00:11:02,528
I think he is a relative
of Doña Victorina.

130
00:11:02,595 --> 00:11:04,830
Good thing I went there

131
00:11:04,897 --> 00:11:08,401
to let everyone know about the revocation
of my excommunication.

132
00:11:08,968 --> 00:11:10,836
Good timing, sir!

133
00:11:10,903 --> 00:11:12,838
I should have tagged along.

134
00:11:12,905 --> 00:11:15,708
I really want to see their reactions.

135
00:11:15,775 --> 00:11:18,878
That accident earlier
could've been avoided too.

136
00:11:20,479 --> 00:11:23,783
I'm sure Father Damaso
was very humiliated.

137
00:11:25,317 --> 00:11:27,853
Thank you for taking me home.

138
00:11:28,587 --> 00:11:32,525
Forgive me for everything
that happened earlier.

139
00:11:33,893 --> 00:11:35,428
Well, well, well!

140
00:11:35,494 --> 00:11:41,033
Looks like Ibarra is becoming bolder
this time around, friar.

141
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:45,571
Not only does he have
the captain general on his side,

142
00:11:45,638 --> 00:11:48,441
he also has the archbishop.

143
00:11:49,141 --> 00:11:51,811
That is not true.

144
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:57,083
I think the captain general
was just able to convince

145
00:11:57,149 --> 00:11:58,984
our archbishop.

146
00:12:00,586 --> 00:12:02,154
But that's not a problem.

147
00:12:02,922 --> 00:12:07,626
Even if Ibarra's punishment
is already revoked,

148
00:12:07,693 --> 00:12:10,429
I still cannot forgive him.

149
00:12:11,297 --> 00:12:16,736
I will make sure
he does not marry Maria Clara!

150
00:12:17,303 --> 00:12:19,071
Mark my words!

151
00:12:19,138 --> 00:12:23,676
You are in no position
to make that decision for her.

152
00:12:24,543 --> 00:12:27,580
Unless you're her father.
Isn't that right?

153
00:12:29,548 --> 00:12:32,084
Listen, young man.

154
00:12:32,852 --> 00:12:34,320
Listen carefully.

155
00:12:35,955 --> 00:12:39,692
Whatever my decision is,

156
00:12:40,459 --> 00:12:44,997
it will also be Santiago's decision.

157
00:12:45,865 --> 00:12:47,133
Believe me.

158
00:12:48,134 --> 00:12:52,371
Now, our agreement
will still push through.

159
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:58,244
A grand wedding is to be prepared
for Alfonso…

160
00:12:58,811 --> 00:13:00,279
and Maria Clara.

161
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:03,149
-Very good! Very good!
-Yes.

162
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:06,652
-Thank you, friar!
-My pleasure.

163
00:13:06,719 --> 00:13:12,291
-You are heaven-sent, Father.
-Thank you.

164
00:13:12,358 --> 00:13:14,360
Goodbye, Father Damaso.

165
00:13:29,408 --> 00:13:30,409
Father.

166
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:34,480
Why is Godfather deciding for me
and not you?

167
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:38,217
Why can't you even defend me
from my godfather?

168
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:45,324
My happiness is at stake, Father.

169
00:13:45,891 --> 00:13:47,726
I am your only child.

170
00:13:49,428 --> 00:13:53,732
Are you also willing to sacrifice that
for the sake of my godfather?

171
00:13:59,605 --> 00:14:01,874
I am worried about Maria.

172
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:07,079
I know she promised she'd marry me but…

173
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:09,615
I am still worried.

174
00:14:13,786 --> 00:14:17,189
I know it is hard
to trust people around here.

175
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:20,125
But Maria Clara is different.

176
00:14:20,659 --> 00:14:22,828
Trust my namesake a little.

177
00:14:23,495 --> 00:14:25,931
You may not be aware but she's fierce too.

178
00:14:27,266 --> 00:14:29,668
The rumors about her
being weak aren't true.

179
00:14:29,735 --> 00:14:32,404
I'm confident
she won't give in to pressure,

180
00:14:32,471 --> 00:14:35,441
even from Godfather
who's just unbelievable.

181
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:39,078
You're right.

182
00:14:40,512 --> 00:14:44,817
It's not her I worry about
but about the people around her.

183
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:49,655
That's why we have decided.
to longer give delay.

184
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:56,195
I'm going to ask Maria Clara's hand
so we can get married.

185
00:15:08,774 --> 00:15:12,411
If I am going to fight for you…

186
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:20,119
would you like me to end up
like Crisostomo's father?

187
00:15:23,956 --> 00:15:25,424
I witnessed…

188
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:29,728
the consequences he got
from Father Damaso's wrath.

189
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:33,198
He was imprisoned for many years.

190
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:36,702
He suffered from the crimes
he didn't commit.

191
00:15:39,305 --> 00:15:41,373
That's enough, cousin.

192
00:15:41,907 --> 00:15:47,046
I thought you wanted to prevent
Maria from hearing about this?

193
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:49,748
She needs to understand, Isabel.

194
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:52,618
People like us…

195
00:15:53,185 --> 00:15:55,020
despite our wealth,

196
00:15:55,087 --> 00:16:01,260
are still helpless and powerless
against a prominent friar.

197
00:16:02,895 --> 00:16:04,463
Do you understand, Maria?

198
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:10,836
If I disobey the friar's wishes,

199
00:16:11,837 --> 00:16:13,639
we will all suffer.

200
00:16:15,074 --> 00:16:17,743
Not only will your godfather punish me,

201
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:21,347
but everything that ours will be gone too.

202
00:16:23,215 --> 00:16:28,721
Are you going to let me end up in ruins
just like Crisostomo's father?

203
00:16:34,526 --> 00:16:35,995
No, Father.

204
00:16:39,231 --> 00:16:44,803
It's just… I cannot bear
to marry a man I do not love.

205
00:16:47,906 --> 00:16:50,175
Love is something you can learn, my child.

206
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:54,613
So stop being stubborn.

207
00:16:55,748 --> 00:16:56,882
There is nothing we can do.

208
00:16:57,383 --> 00:17:02,021
You better cut ties
with Crisostomo Ibarra now.

209
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:38,524
And who is this person…

210
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:41,226
who agreed to be part of our plan?

211
00:17:41,293 --> 00:17:42,961
He is Pedro, Father.

212
00:17:43,028 --> 00:17:46,532
He's the husband of Sisa
and the father of the missing sacristans.

213
00:17:47,332 --> 00:17:48,500
Why?

214
00:17:49,301 --> 00:17:50,369
Why him?

215
00:17:51,003 --> 00:17:52,838
What if that person…

216
00:17:53,972 --> 00:17:57,843
betrays and deceives you? Us?

217
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:00,245
That will not happen because

218
00:18:00,312 --> 00:18:03,048
Pedro only cares about the gambling money

219
00:18:03,115 --> 00:18:04,416
more than anything else.

220
00:18:06,685 --> 00:18:08,153
Are you certain about that?

221
00:18:09,121 --> 00:18:12,624
Very well. Hurry up and find other people

222
00:18:12,691 --> 00:18:15,627
who may speak against Crisostomo Ibarra.

223
00:18:15,694 --> 00:18:18,130
-As you wish, curate.
-Go!

224
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:26,572
Damn it!

225
00:18:27,406 --> 00:18:28,640
Scoundrel!

226
00:18:28,707 --> 00:18:30,109
Stupid!

227
00:18:30,175 --> 00:18:33,545
-Traitor!
-You seem very furious, your reverence.

228
00:18:35,414 --> 00:18:36,348
What happened?

229
00:18:36,915 --> 00:18:39,685
The archbishop took Ibarra's side.

230
00:18:39,751 --> 00:18:44,723
He lifted the punishment
of excommunication we imposed

231
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,859
on that stupid mestizo!

232
00:18:48,727 --> 00:18:52,064
Earlier, he humiliated me again

233
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:54,967
in front of Maria Clara
and many other people!

234
00:18:56,735 --> 00:18:59,271
Shameless! Disrespectful!

235
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:01,974
What a scoundrel.

236
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:09,014
Does this mean Maria will finally
get married to Crisostomo?

237
00:19:09,515 --> 00:19:11,517
My suspicion was right.

238
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:13,218
Maria does not want

239
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:16,121
nor will she ever agree

240
00:19:17,256 --> 00:19:19,091
to be separated from Crisostomo Ibarra.

241
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:20,759
That will never happen!

242
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:25,197
I will never allow Maria to be the wife

243
00:19:25,697 --> 00:19:28,233
of Rafael Ibarra's son.

244
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:33,038
But what can I do?

245
00:19:33,872 --> 00:19:36,975
Maria is becoming uncontrollable

246
00:19:37,042 --> 00:19:38,911
and wants to disobey me!

247
00:20:17,649 --> 00:20:19,618
Be strong, my child.

248
00:20:24,189 --> 00:20:26,458
Crisostomo's promise of marriage…

249
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:31,263
is as clear as day.

250
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:35,000
But what if…

251
00:20:38,036 --> 00:20:42,874
a dark future awaits us?

252
00:20:45,377 --> 00:20:49,114
Then you must stay strong, my child.

253
00:20:50,115 --> 00:20:53,051
Just like the hero in the story,

254
00:20:53,118 --> 00:20:56,421
you are also the hero of your own story.

255
00:20:56,488 --> 00:21:01,593
What are you willing to do
and sacrifice for Sir Ibarra?

256
00:21:15,641 --> 00:21:17,542
I owe this to Klay.

257
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:20,445
My namesake.

258
00:21:25,417 --> 00:21:27,386
She taught me…

259
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:33,125
to be assertive about what I want.

260
00:21:38,563 --> 00:21:40,132
That is one thing…

261
00:21:42,034 --> 00:21:43,735
I wasn't able to do.

262
00:21:47,239 --> 00:21:49,241
What do you mean, Auntie?

263
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:53,078
In my younger years,

264
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:56,915
I had a…

265
00:21:59,618 --> 00:22:01,053
lover.

266
00:22:02,621 --> 00:22:03,655
But…

267
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:09,027
my father opposed our relationship

268
00:22:09,094 --> 00:22:12,197
because he was just a farmer's son.

269
00:22:14,566 --> 00:22:16,468
I listened to my father.

270
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:19,905
I obeyed him.

271
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:24,242
Because I thought
it was the right thing to do.

272
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:29,514
I thought maybe…

273
00:22:31,717 --> 00:22:34,820
maybe I'd eventually forget
about Reynaldo.

274
00:22:40,325 --> 00:22:41,727
But…

275
00:22:41,793 --> 00:22:44,429
but I still remember him.

276
00:22:47,065 --> 00:22:48,800
Sometimes I think…

277
00:22:51,103 --> 00:22:54,106
I could have lived a happy life…

278
00:22:54,172 --> 00:22:55,941
if I had chosen him.

279
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:00,579
Unlike now.

280
00:23:07,619 --> 00:23:08,820
But…

281
00:23:11,089 --> 00:23:13,625
it is too late for me now.

282
00:23:15,961 --> 00:23:17,429
But you…

283
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:25,070
you can still decide for yourself.

284
00:23:27,773 --> 00:23:29,808
Does this mean…

285
00:23:33,545 --> 00:23:37,449
you are allowing me
to fight for Crisostomo?

286
00:23:42,454 --> 00:23:45,690
I just want you to be happy.

287
00:23:46,825 --> 00:23:50,195
That is all.
I want you to be happy, my child.

288
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:21,893
Hush now.

289
00:24:25,163 --> 00:24:26,865
Rest, my child.

290
00:24:52,624 --> 00:24:55,393
According to the man
I ordered to investigate,

291
00:24:56,995 --> 00:25:00,532
Klay is once again staying
at Mister Ibarra's house.

292
00:25:04,436 --> 00:25:07,973
Andeng already told me that.

293
00:25:08,473 --> 00:25:10,675
A woman beat you to it.

294
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:15,480
Perhaps, Andeng also told you

295
00:25:15,547 --> 00:25:18,550
that another man is following Klay around.

296
00:25:20,118 --> 00:25:23,154
What do you mean? Who is he?

297
00:25:23,722 --> 00:25:27,759
Mister Ibarra's friend, Fidel.

298
00:25:29,427 --> 00:25:32,764
It seems seeing his friend
is not his only purpose

299
00:25:32,831 --> 00:25:35,600
every time he visits the Ibarras.

300
00:25:39,304 --> 00:25:41,339
What an extraordinary woman.

301
00:25:43,108 --> 00:25:47,879
She even managed to lure
the town's most well-known businessman.

302
00:25:49,748 --> 00:25:51,316
What is with that woman?

303
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:56,855
Doesn't she have a family
or a father that worries for her?

304
00:25:56,922 --> 00:26:01,493
How come she's able to roam around
with men like Crisostomo and Fidel?

305
00:26:03,795 --> 00:26:05,163
All right.

306
00:26:06,865 --> 00:26:10,035
Just keep spying on that woman.

307
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:16,174
So we will know her next actions.

308
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:20,245
She cannot hinder
my next steps any longer.

309
00:26:21,346 --> 00:26:22,280
Yes, Father.

310
00:26:23,515 --> 00:26:24,716
You may go.

311
00:26:49,841 --> 00:26:55,347
It is time for me to use this.

312
00:26:57,816 --> 00:27:02,487
Even that woman, Klay…

313
00:27:04,155 --> 00:27:07,692
cannot stop my plans.

314
00:27:09,227 --> 00:27:13,031
A secret about the true identity of Maria

315
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:16,668
and the humiliation of her…

316
00:27:17,435 --> 00:27:18,570
father.

317
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:26,411
I am certain I will be the one to tame

318
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:28,713
my beloved…

319
00:27:30,048 --> 00:27:31,483
Maria Clara.

320
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:36,821
Can Maria still defend Crisostomo

321
00:27:36,888 --> 00:27:41,693
at the expense of her fathers' safety?

322
00:27:58,576 --> 00:28:00,045
Forgive me.

323
00:28:00,111 --> 00:28:02,947
I've been looking for Mister Adong
but I still haven't seen him.

324
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:04,149
Is he not around?

325
00:28:05,383 --> 00:28:08,119
I asked him to prepare everything I need

326
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:10,188
for my wedding proposal.

327
00:28:12,991 --> 00:28:14,359
Is this a big event?

328
00:28:16,394 --> 00:28:19,464
It will be a gathering filled with music.

329
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:25,937
I also prepared gifts
for my sweetheart's family.

330
00:28:31,276 --> 00:28:34,279
What if Don Captain Tiago still refuses?

331
00:28:34,913 --> 00:28:37,682
Especially if he continues
to be swayed by Father Damaso.

332
00:28:44,255 --> 00:28:49,360
As long as Maria Clara is willing
to fight for our love together,

333
00:28:49,427 --> 00:28:50,929
I am ready to risk it all…

334
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:54,232
just to get Don Tiago's blessing.

335
00:28:59,938 --> 00:29:01,239
You know…

336
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:03,608
I'm impressed with you and Maria Clara

337
00:29:03,675 --> 00:29:06,377
because you're both
fighting for your love.

338
00:29:07,979 --> 00:29:10,448
If only I finished reading that---

339
00:29:13,051 --> 00:29:16,888
I wish you both a happy ending together.

340
00:29:20,125 --> 00:29:21,259
I hope so.

341
00:29:23,695 --> 00:29:24,863
I hope so.

342
00:29:29,234 --> 00:29:31,136
I also wish that you find…

343
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:35,707
the man you'll love
and will love you unconditionally.

344
00:29:38,309 --> 00:29:41,212
<i>Miss Klay</i>

345
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:44,949
It sounds like someone's singing outside.

346
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:47,018
Is he?

347
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:49,721
You're right.

348
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:52,023
His voice sounds familiar.

349
00:29:52,824 --> 00:29:53,958
Let's see who it is.

350
00:29:55,093 --> 00:29:58,563
<i>I want to ask you</i>

351
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:03,668
<i>Forgiveness for the way I acted</i>

352
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:09,741
<i>Ever since the day we met</i>

353
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:13,344
<i>I hope you understand</i>

354
00:30:13,411 --> 00:30:17,048
Miss Klay, looks like
my friend is serenading you.

355
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:21,052
My wish suddenly came true.

356
00:30:22,086 --> 00:30:24,088
Here is a man who adores you.

357
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:26,891
<i>The moments we shared</i>

358
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:32,363
<i>May this song take away</i>

359
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:36,601
<i>The bitterness</i>

360
00:30:37,235 --> 00:30:40,572
<i>Of our past</i>

361
00:30:42,707 --> 00:30:48,546
<i>My sweet love for you</i>

362
00:30:50,381 --> 00:30:53,351
<i>Miss Klay</i>

363
00:30:53,418 --> 00:30:55,220
That's enough, Sir Fidel.

364
00:30:55,286 --> 00:30:56,321
You're hurting my ears.

365
00:30:56,387 --> 00:30:57,922
Stop, please.

366
00:31:03,161 --> 00:31:04,429
My apologies…

367
00:31:05,997 --> 00:31:07,098
Miss Klay.

368
00:31:10,735 --> 00:31:12,003
My friend.

369
00:31:12,837 --> 00:31:15,206
Good evening to you.

370
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:19,611
Can I come inside your house?

371
00:31:23,348 --> 00:31:24,349
No.

372
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:26,417
We're tired.

373
00:31:26,484 --> 00:31:27,852
You can't come in.

374
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:28,920
Go home.

375
00:31:35,326 --> 00:31:36,361
Let's go.

376
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:45,336
Didn't I tell you…

377
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:49,474
to play the guitar
to the tune of my voice?

378
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:51,309
Look what happened.

379
00:31:52,143 --> 00:31:54,779
My lady is annoyed now because of you.

380
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:57,782
Go now before I decide not to pay you.

381
00:32:14,165 --> 00:32:15,166
My friend.

382
00:32:16,968 --> 00:32:21,172
I am aware of your love for Miss Klay but…

383
00:32:21,239 --> 00:32:24,509
I never thought you would serenade her.

384
00:32:24,575 --> 00:32:25,944
My friend.

385
00:32:27,178 --> 00:32:28,546
I need to woo her.

386
00:32:29,647 --> 00:32:32,083
Because the last time we saw each other,

387
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:34,786
I did something really bad.

388
00:32:36,688 --> 00:32:38,222
I'm sorry, my friend.

389
00:32:39,257 --> 00:32:41,192
I did not ask for your permission

390
00:32:41,259 --> 00:32:45,797
with regards to courting your friend.

391
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:50,668
You do not need my permission, my friend.

392
00:32:51,903 --> 00:32:54,572
You are free to court her if you wish.

393
00:32:56,074 --> 00:33:00,578
-I will only ask for one thing.
-What is it, my friend?

394
00:33:02,413 --> 00:33:07,018
Don't hurt and play
with Miss Klay's heart.

395
00:33:10,388 --> 00:33:12,290
I know you very well, my friend.

396
00:33:13,524 --> 00:33:16,060
You are popular among women.

397
00:33:20,064 --> 00:33:21,632
I have changed, my friend.

398
00:33:21,699 --> 00:33:23,768
My feelings are real…

399
00:33:25,036 --> 00:33:29,107
for the lady whose words
are sharper than a knife.

400
00:33:31,409 --> 00:33:34,345
But despite that, I know…

401
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:38,116
she has a good heart

402
00:33:39,317 --> 00:33:42,320
with incredible talents and great wit,

403
00:33:42,387 --> 00:33:45,156
that you cannot find
in other women around here.

404
00:33:47,125 --> 00:33:49,060
Why would I hurt her?

405
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:51,596
I think it's the other way around…

406
00:33:53,231 --> 00:33:54,899
for that feisty woman.

407
00:33:56,167 --> 00:33:57,368
Well, then.

408
00:33:58,236 --> 00:34:00,104
I only have one piece of advice for you.

409
00:34:01,472 --> 00:34:03,975
Don't give up easily on her.

410
00:34:06,911 --> 00:34:09,580
Just like how you fought for Maria Clara.

411
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:13,418
I promise.

412
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:48,119
-Thank you, miss.
-Thank you.

413
00:34:51,189 --> 00:34:54,425
You are still very lucky, sir.

414
00:34:54,992 --> 00:35:00,498
You have powerful friends
who are willing to help you.

415
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:06,604
Can the natives depend on the system?

416
00:35:06,671 --> 00:35:08,306
Or is it only beneficial to you?

417
00:35:08,372 --> 00:35:13,010
How long are you going
to stay connected to the colonizers?

418
00:35:14,512 --> 00:35:18,983
Unlike natives like us,

419
00:35:20,651 --> 00:35:25,189
we do not have a captain general
or an archbishop

420
00:35:25,256 --> 00:35:28,759
who we can call for help.

421
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:32,730
Just like Sisa and her sons.

422
00:35:33,931 --> 00:35:37,135
Yes. Just like them.

423
00:35:38,269 --> 00:35:44,275
Did you know Sisa's husband
has returned to San Diego?

424
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:47,245
My name is Pedro.

425
00:35:47,311 --> 00:35:50,781
I am the husband of Sisa
and the father of Crispin and Basilio.

426
00:35:52,216 --> 00:35:53,284
Really?

427
00:35:55,086 --> 00:35:56,521
How is he?

428
00:35:57,088 --> 00:36:00,358
Was he worried
about what happened to his family?

429
00:36:00,858 --> 00:36:02,860
It seems like he does not care.

430
00:36:04,061 --> 00:36:05,897
Instead of being worried,

431
00:36:06,464 --> 00:36:08,499
he even asked me for money.

432
00:36:09,033 --> 00:36:11,869
As if all the help we did
for them wasn't enough.

433
00:36:12,937 --> 00:36:16,641
Sir, do you think
we have done enough to help Sisa?

434
00:36:18,209 --> 00:36:21,212
It is unacceptable

435
00:36:21,279 --> 00:36:24,182
that there exists a person

436
00:36:24,248 --> 00:36:28,452
who cares more about his vices

437
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:32,757
than his poor family.

438
00:36:32,823 --> 00:36:37,695
Did you know that Pedro
is addicted to rooster fights?

439
00:36:38,262 --> 00:36:39,597
Goodness.

440
00:36:39,664 --> 00:36:42,400
He even bought a rooster yesterday,

441
00:36:43,334 --> 00:36:50,241
blinded without any remorse
for the tragedy his family suffered.

442
00:36:52,276 --> 00:36:54,045
It makes me wonder…

443
00:36:54,812 --> 00:36:59,717
where he got the money to buy a rooster.

444
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:07,358
Excuse me, Clarita.

445
00:37:07,425 --> 00:37:09,627
But where are we going?

446
00:37:09,694 --> 00:37:13,297
Why didn't you ask permission
from your father before he left?

447
00:37:13,364 --> 00:37:15,833
Lower your voice. Someone might hear you.

448
00:37:16,834 --> 00:37:18,769
While my father is gambling

449
00:37:18,836 --> 00:37:22,707
and my aunt is attending a meeting,

450
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:26,010
we will go see my friends.

451
00:37:26,711 --> 00:37:29,480
No one should know
we are going to Crisostomo's house.

452
00:37:30,481 --> 00:37:32,250
My goodness, Clarita!

453
00:37:32,783 --> 00:37:35,086
Your father will surely be mad at you.

454
00:37:35,653 --> 00:37:37,922
-No, let's just go back.
-Andeng.

455
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:43,060
We will go there

456
00:37:43,127 --> 00:37:45,696
so we can discuss Crisostomo's proposal.

457
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:48,699
A proposal, you say.

458
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:50,635
But…

459
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:55,139
You will not complain
or tell anyone about this.

460
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:57,008
Do you understand?

461
00:37:57,074 --> 00:37:57,942
Let's go.

462
00:37:58,009 --> 00:38:00,311
Señorita Clarita,
someone is looking for you.

463
00:38:03,314 --> 00:38:05,116
Good morning, Señorita Maria.

464
00:38:05,683 --> 00:38:08,219
I am one of Renato's churchmates.

465
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:10,154
The curate asked me to fetch you.

466
00:38:12,690 --> 00:38:15,993
Please tell Friar Salvi…

467
00:38:16,927 --> 00:38:18,929
I have important matters to attend to.

468
00:38:20,164 --> 00:38:22,266
We will just talk some other time.

469
00:38:23,167 --> 00:38:24,268
Andeng.

470
00:38:24,335 --> 00:38:25,403
Forgive me.

471
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:28,572
He asked me
with complete urgency, señorita.

472
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:32,209
That is why the curate instructed me
to bring you to him immediately.

473
00:38:32,276 --> 00:38:35,846
He said this has something to do
with Señor Crisostomo Ibarra.

474
00:38:41,619 --> 00:38:44,588
Is gambling still rampant
here in San Diego?

475
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:46,457
And the friars just allow it?

476
00:38:46,957 --> 00:38:49,093
Why would they be against it?

477
00:38:49,593 --> 00:38:56,233
Those who run gambling dens pay big taxes.

478
00:38:58,903 --> 00:39:02,807
They've transformed this town
into a huge business

479
00:39:02,873 --> 00:39:06,510
and foreigners profit from it.

480
00:39:07,044 --> 00:39:11,515
We are just like cattle
that are taken good care of

481
00:39:12,083 --> 00:39:18,389
only to be slaughtered
and served on the dining table.

482
00:39:20,691 --> 00:39:22,126
Things have gotten worse.

483
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:25,830
Things in our town
have really gotten worse.

484
00:39:27,231 --> 00:39:31,168
Especially with the wickedness
of the friars around here.

485
00:39:31,669 --> 00:39:32,903
It is just like…

486
00:39:34,138 --> 00:39:37,975
a severe case of cancer
that cannot be cured.

487
00:39:39,343 --> 00:39:43,547
<i>No matter how broken,
a heart may continue to love.</i>

488
00:39:43,614 --> 00:39:46,717
<i>What must be considered
is whether it is strong enough</i>

489
00:39:46,784 --> 00:39:49,787
<i>to cure the cancer of this town.</i>

490
00:39:50,521 --> 00:39:53,858
Here's my question for you.

491
00:39:55,893 --> 00:39:58,996
Are you the doctor

492
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:03,801
who will help heal San Diego?

493
00:40:03,868 --> 00:40:05,369
Or…

494
00:40:06,003 --> 00:40:10,608
are you just like the rich folk

495
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:15,146
who will choose to turn a blind eye?

496
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:19,950
Let me ask you.

497
00:40:20,017 --> 00:40:23,120
Isn't it part of your dream for San Diego

498
00:40:23,187 --> 00:40:27,792
to remove the injustices and cruelty
of the friars and civil guards

499
00:40:27,858 --> 00:40:29,593
against our own race?

500
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:37,568
Farewell, sir.

501
00:40:42,206 --> 00:40:43,541
Miss.

502
00:41:00,691 --> 00:41:02,226
Sir, to tell you the truth…

503
00:41:03,027 --> 00:41:06,197
your conversation
with Pilosopo Tasyo got me thinking

504
00:41:06,263 --> 00:41:09,767
about the cancer of this town.

505
00:41:12,102 --> 00:41:13,504
I don't know.

506
00:41:13,571 --> 00:41:16,607
In this world,
I guess it can't be weeded out.

507
00:41:16,674 --> 00:41:18,809
It doesn't matter
whether the world is old or new,

508
00:41:18,876 --> 00:41:21,078
whether we're in the past or future,

509
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:25,049
corruption and abuse
by those in power will always exist.

510
00:41:26,350 --> 00:41:29,753
But I still don't want to believe
what Mr. Torres told me back then.

511
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:32,423
These words I'll say, remember them.

512
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:37,661
No love will ever triumph
in a tumultuous society.

513
00:41:39,463 --> 00:41:42,466
What he said also got me thinking.

514
00:41:42,533 --> 00:41:44,068
Who? Mr. Torres?

515
00:41:46,537 --> 00:41:47,905
Pilosopo Tasyo.

516
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:00,084
Why?

517
00:42:00,584 --> 00:42:03,187
Pilosopo Tasyo was once my mentor.

518
00:42:03,254 --> 00:42:07,024
But I chose to turn a blind eye
to the wrongdoings of those people

519
00:42:07,758 --> 00:42:09,793
who loathe me now.

520
00:42:10,928 --> 00:42:14,465
I tolerated the crooked ways
of the friars, of Father Damaso,

521
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:17,968
since he is the godfather of my fiancée.

522
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:21,472
I tried to do what you said.

523
00:42:22,406 --> 00:42:24,808
I tried to fight back a little but…

524
00:42:25,476 --> 00:42:27,378
it was still not enough.

525
00:42:27,444 --> 00:42:29,480
And what did I gain from it?

526
00:42:30,781 --> 00:42:33,150
The friars are making things
harder for me.

527
00:42:34,118 --> 00:42:37,788
They keep me away
from the people and things I love.

528
00:42:38,422 --> 00:42:39,657
My father.

529
00:42:40,624 --> 00:42:41,792
My school.

530
00:42:44,528 --> 00:42:45,696
Maria.

531
00:42:50,701 --> 00:42:52,169
You're right.

532
00:42:53,103 --> 00:42:55,105
That makes me wonder too.

533
00:42:55,940 --> 00:43:01,378
Why is Father Damaso so agitated at you
when it comes to Señorita Maria Clara?

534
00:43:03,247 --> 00:43:05,516
Those two have a connection.

535
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:08,819
I just can't remember what it is
because I was not listening

536
00:43:08,886 --> 00:43:13,190
to my old high school teachers
and professors back in college--

537
00:43:16,126 --> 00:43:19,663
I am talking too much again.
Me and my big mouth.

538
00:43:21,699 --> 00:43:24,234
I think you are like them sometimes.

539
00:43:25,235 --> 00:43:29,607
You remind me of Sisa
when she completely lost her mind.

540
00:43:30,908 --> 00:43:33,978
Or perhaps a creature from another planet.

541
00:43:38,482 --> 00:43:40,150
But going back to what I said…

542
00:43:41,652 --> 00:43:43,554
I'm absolutely curious.

543
00:43:45,356 --> 00:43:49,259
Why is Father Damaso so meddlesome

544
00:43:49,326 --> 00:43:51,996
with you and Señorita Maria Clara?

545
00:44:08,345 --> 00:44:09,413
Maria.

546
00:44:10,581 --> 00:44:13,751
I'm glad you accepted my invitation.

547
00:44:16,387 --> 00:44:17,788
You may leave us now.

548
00:44:24,895 --> 00:44:27,297
Maria, the matter we are to talk about

549
00:44:27,364 --> 00:44:29,366
must not be heard by anyone else.

550
00:44:30,734 --> 00:44:34,171
Please, wait for us outside.

551
00:44:43,881 --> 00:44:44,748
Go.

552
00:44:46,116 --> 00:44:47,317
Very good.

553
00:44:48,786 --> 00:44:49,920
Good.

554
00:44:52,623 --> 00:44:54,324
Now, Father.

555
00:44:55,025 --> 00:44:57,127
What do we need to talk about?

556
00:45:10,741 --> 00:45:12,142
Good morning.

557
00:45:12,943 --> 00:45:15,112
Please sit. Sit down.

558
00:45:15,913 --> 00:45:19,917
Etta! Bring us some refreshments!

559
00:45:21,885 --> 00:45:23,754
What brings you here, señor?

560
00:45:25,189 --> 00:45:27,658
I'm here to ask for your blessing

561
00:45:27,725 --> 00:45:30,327
if I may come back some other time

562
00:45:30,394 --> 00:45:34,198
to formally ask for your daughter's hand…

563
00:45:35,866 --> 00:45:37,601
so we can get married.

564
00:45:42,973 --> 00:45:47,277
What you are asking for
is impossible, Crisostomo.

565
00:45:50,247 --> 00:45:52,549
Crisostomo, even though…

566
00:45:52,616 --> 00:45:55,385
your excommunication has been lifted,

567
00:45:56,453 --> 00:45:58,489
you're already at odds with the friar.

568
00:45:58,555 --> 00:46:01,325
If I allow you to marry Maria,

569
00:46:01,391 --> 00:46:04,561
it would signify…

570
00:46:04,628 --> 00:46:06,797
that I am taking your side.

571
00:46:07,297 --> 00:46:11,368
But the archbishop himself
has given his judgment.

572
00:46:12,636 --> 00:46:15,239
He said there was no reason for me
to be deemed an enemy

573
00:46:15,305 --> 00:46:17,107
of the friars here in San Diego.

574
00:46:17,174 --> 00:46:18,509
Right.

575
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:21,545
Hello.

576
00:46:23,514 --> 00:46:27,718
Are the friars around here
superior to the archbishop?

577
00:46:27,785 --> 00:46:31,088
-Isn't he their leader?
-Keep quiet, woman.

578
00:46:32,456 --> 00:46:36,260
Don't meddle in discussions
you are not part of.

579
00:46:40,030 --> 00:46:42,766
Maria, I will not beat around the bush.

580
00:46:43,333 --> 00:46:44,468
I know…

581
00:46:44,535 --> 00:46:48,839
you've kept letters
from Crisostomo Ibarra.

582
00:46:49,473 --> 00:46:51,408
I would like you to give them to me.

583
00:46:52,242 --> 00:46:55,012
And why do you want Crisostomo's letters?

584
00:46:55,512 --> 00:46:58,315
I want to read them, Maria.

585
00:46:59,016 --> 00:47:04,621
So I can make sure they do not contain
any messages or thoughts

586
00:47:05,189 --> 00:47:10,327
that are against the laws of God
or the government of Spain.

587
00:47:10,394 --> 00:47:14,898
This is for your own good, Maria.

588
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:19,903
Those letters only contain

589
00:47:20,404 --> 00:47:23,907
words of affection for his fiancée.

590
00:47:24,474 --> 00:47:28,879
You will not see or read anything
that can destroy Crisostomo.

591
00:47:28,946 --> 00:47:30,180
I apologize.

592
00:47:30,247 --> 00:47:33,283
We have nothing more to talk about.

593
00:47:34,585 --> 00:47:36,053
Farewell.

594
00:47:37,221 --> 00:47:38,889
Wait, one moment.

595
00:47:41,725 --> 00:47:45,863
What if I told you that I have with me

596
00:47:46,563 --> 00:47:50,334
a letter from your mother
addressed to Father Damaso?

597
00:47:54,605 --> 00:48:00,143
It's a letter that will bring great shame…

598
00:48:00,978 --> 00:48:03,914
to your godfather and your father.

599
00:48:06,950 --> 00:48:08,719
What shame do you speak of?

600
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:13,857
Shame that will cause a huge scandal…

601
00:48:14,892 --> 00:48:16,593
for your family.

602
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:19,329
The very family that's greatly treasured

603
00:48:20,130 --> 00:48:22,366
by your foster father.

604
00:48:25,435 --> 00:48:29,039
-My foster father?
-Yes, Maria.

605
00:48:30,774 --> 00:48:33,510
From what I've read in this letter,

606
00:48:36,413 --> 00:48:39,516
Captain Tiago is not your real father.

607
00:48:44,288 --> 00:48:47,324
Your real father is no other than…

608
00:48:47,391 --> 00:48:50,694
your beloved godfather.

609
00:48:51,395 --> 00:48:53,130
Father Damaso.

610
00:49:26,096 --> 00:49:27,564
<i>I don't want to see that pervert.</i>

611
00:49:27,631 --> 00:49:29,132
He stole a kiss from me.

612
00:49:29,199 --> 00:49:30,701
If he committed such a shameful act,

613
00:49:30,767 --> 00:49:33,170
then he must give you justice.

614
00:49:34,071 --> 00:49:37,708
He must marry you as soon as possible.

615
00:49:38,875 --> 00:49:41,478
A marriage that I will not refuse.

616
00:49:41,545 --> 00:49:44,748
<i>It's a pity my wife passed away so soon.</i>

617
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:47,617
I am sure she will be proud
of our daughter.

618
00:49:47,684 --> 00:49:51,488
<i>We were able to raise her
as a respectful and religious lady.</i>

619
00:49:51,555 --> 00:49:53,323
<i>Señor, someone is looking for you.</i>

620
00:49:53,390 --> 00:49:54,424
<i>Who?</i>

621
00:49:54,491 --> 00:49:57,060
<i>-Good day, señor.
-I am your friend.</i>

622
00:49:57,127 --> 00:50:00,564
Tell me, why are you distraught?

623
00:50:01,131 --> 00:50:02,966
Why are you crying?

624
00:50:03,667 --> 00:50:05,736
COMING UP…

625
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:13,543
