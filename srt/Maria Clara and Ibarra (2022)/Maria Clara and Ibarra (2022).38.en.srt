00:00:28,395 --> 00:00:31,064
MARIA CLARA AND IBARRA

2
00:00:31,564 --> 00:00:35,568
THIS PROGRAM, WHICH IS ADAPTED
FROM THE NOVELS OF DR. JOSE P. RIZAL,

3
00:00:35,635 --> 00:00:40,573
IS PRESENTED USING DRAMATIC ELEMENTS
TO CONNECT THE PRESENT AND THE PAST

4
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:46,379
IN A SPECIAL REIMAGINING OF THE NATIONAL
LITERATURE FILIPINOS ARE PROUD OF.

5
00:00:46,946 --> 00:00:47,814
A beautiful woman.

6
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:50,050
I am sure this will be a steamy night.

7
00:00:50,116 --> 00:00:52,685
<i>Well then, let us not waste time.</i>

8
00:00:52,752 --> 00:00:55,755
<i>Let us put some heat
in your bodies with this wine, señores.</i>

9
00:00:55,822 --> 00:00:56,823
PREVIOUSLY

10
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:58,725
Ms. Klay, what you're doing is dangerous.

11
00:00:58,792 --> 00:01:00,760
You saved my life countless times.

12
00:01:00,827 --> 00:01:02,328
Thank you so much.

13
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:03,596
Ms. Klay…

14
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:09,069
Here's everything that Ms. Klay
has saved from your house.

15
00:01:09,135 --> 00:01:11,304
I don't know how I can thank all of you.

16
00:01:11,371 --> 00:01:14,541
You all saved my life from certain death.

17
00:01:14,607 --> 00:01:16,810
Don't you recognize me?

18
00:01:16,876 --> 00:01:18,711
Mother, I am your son.

19
00:01:18,778 --> 00:01:20,180
I'm Basilio!

20
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:21,781
My son…

21
00:01:21,848 --> 00:01:22,949
Liar!

22
00:01:23,016 --> 00:01:25,385
You're a demon pretending to be my son!

23
00:01:25,452 --> 00:01:27,554
-Get away from me!
-Mother!

24
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:28,855
<i>Where is Ms. Klay?</i>

25
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:30,657
<i>She dared to go back there alone.</i>

26
00:01:30,723 --> 00:01:34,594
<i>So just pray that she'll be able
to help your friend escape.</i>

27
00:01:34,661 --> 00:01:35,862
What are you doing here?

28
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:37,464
Fidel!

29
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:39,666
One flick of this gun and you're dead!

30
00:01:42,202 --> 00:01:43,336
Let's go, Adong.

31
00:01:43,403 --> 00:01:44,304
Hurry!

32
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:45,338
Where are you going?

33
00:01:45,405 --> 00:01:47,073
-Fidel!
-Come here.

34
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:51,845
Incompetents!

35
00:01:51,911 --> 00:01:53,046
Stupid!

36
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:55,815
Find the criminals and arrest them!

37
00:01:55,882 --> 00:01:57,350
You're shaking.

38
00:01:57,417 --> 00:01:59,219
Do you think I killed the man I shot?

39
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:00,487
Klay, you are also shaking.

40
00:02:00,553 --> 00:02:03,022
Because we almost died, didn't we?

41
00:02:03,089 --> 00:02:05,825
But I was saved by your love.

42
00:02:05,892 --> 00:02:08,995
Love and happiness
may be elusive in this country,

43
00:02:09,062 --> 00:02:12,265
but I choose to endure
and die in my homeland.

44
00:02:12,332 --> 00:02:14,534
But why are you asking me to leave?

45
00:02:14,601 --> 00:02:16,636
You were not born to suffer.

46
00:02:16,703 --> 00:02:18,838
Aren't all these sufferings?

47
00:02:19,405 --> 00:02:20,473
<i>I lost my father,</i>

48
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:22,008
<i>my dignity was taken away from me.</i>

49
00:02:22,075 --> 00:02:23,877
<i>and even the woman I truly love.</i>

50
00:02:23,943 --> 00:02:26,079
If I were to leave this country,

51
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:27,780
<i>I would need to see her first.</i>

52
00:02:27,847 --> 00:02:30,517
I thought I would never see you again.

53
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:33,019
Tonight, I have been declared…

54
00:02:33,086 --> 00:02:34,787
I am now a fugitive.

55
00:02:34,854 --> 00:02:36,723
I will remain in the shadows.

56
00:02:36,789 --> 00:02:38,291
You are still young, Maria.

57
00:02:38,358 --> 00:02:40,193
That's why I am letting you go.

58
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,262
I will give you peace.

59
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:44,097
I wish you happiness.

60
00:02:44,931 --> 00:02:46,366
Farewell.

61
00:02:57,143 --> 00:02:58,044
Klay,

62
00:02:58,978 --> 00:03:02,582
this is the spot where Crisostomo's
grandfather was buried.

63
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:14,794
Well, where are they?

64
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:17,997
Didn't we agree to meet up here?

65
00:03:18,064 --> 00:03:21,568
Fidel, do you know how far they can go
if they traveled in a boat?

66
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:25,672
I don't know.

67
00:03:27,907 --> 00:03:33,279
These days, all I know
is your loving embrace.

68
00:03:36,115 --> 00:03:37,517
Fidel!

69
00:03:37,584 --> 00:03:39,752
Can't you get over the hug yet?

70
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:48,394
San Diego is in chaos right now, Fidel.

71
00:03:48,461 --> 00:03:50,863
All the characters in this story
are distressed and suffering.

72
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:55,368
And you might be forgetting
that we could still die!

73
00:03:55,435 --> 00:03:57,670
And if I should die,

74
00:03:57,737 --> 00:04:00,006
the last words I wish
to come out of my lips

75
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:02,575
as I take my last breath is…

76
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:05,278
I love you.

77
00:04:09,782 --> 00:04:12,318
Ms. Klay, I love you.

78
00:04:14,153 --> 00:04:16,522
I love you despite the mystery
that surrounds you.

79
00:04:18,725 --> 00:04:21,728
I love you despite…

80
00:04:21,794 --> 00:04:24,330
the uncertainty.

81
00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:29,035
You're important to me, okay?

82
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:31,037
That much is obvious to us both.

83
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:33,406
But I already told you,

84
00:04:33,473 --> 00:04:37,010
we are from different worlds,
from different time periods.

85
00:04:37,076 --> 00:04:39,245
And now, we don't have much time!

86
00:04:39,312 --> 00:04:40,413
I am not sure,

87
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,815
but I think this story is about to end!
I don't know!

88
00:04:45,184 --> 00:04:49,188
Lord, please give us a redeeming twist!

89
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:01,834
This forest…

90
00:05:04,103 --> 00:05:06,606
will be our last witness

91
00:05:06,673 --> 00:05:09,142
if our time together
is indeed running out.

92
00:05:13,846 --> 00:05:15,682
Ms. Klay…

93
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,522
I still love you.

94
00:05:24,257 --> 00:05:25,158
Even if I don't know

95
00:05:25,224 --> 00:05:30,763
how I can bridge the time
and the world between us.

96
00:05:52,051 --> 00:05:53,720
Crisostomo…

97
00:05:55,288 --> 00:05:58,758
I don't want
the peace you are offering me.

98
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:13,473
But that is not the life I want for you.

99
00:06:15,074 --> 00:06:20,313
I want nothing
but a peaceful life for you.

100
00:06:22,348 --> 00:06:24,417
It is not you,

101
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:29,422
only I can give that to myself.

102
00:06:32,925 --> 00:06:37,630
And I can only make that happen
if you are with me, Crisostomo.

103
00:06:37,697 --> 00:06:39,766
You. Only you!

104
00:06:40,867 --> 00:06:42,602
Maria…

105
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:55,114
Let's go!

106
00:06:55,181 --> 00:06:56,682
I will go with you.

107
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:59,252
Let's leave all this behind.

108
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:03,122
If we want to be together,

109
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:07,393
that is not possible right now, my love.

110
00:07:09,962 --> 00:07:12,765
Not yet, my love.

111
00:07:15,001 --> 00:07:17,236
If not now, then when?

112
00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:22,809
I cannot bear to be apart
from you, Crisostomo.

113
00:07:25,845 --> 00:07:31,017
Forgive me if I cannot
take you with me yet.

114
00:07:34,387 --> 00:07:35,655
But if you truly…

115
00:07:36,556 --> 00:07:38,191
cannot give up…

116
00:07:39,859 --> 00:07:41,194
on our promise to each other,

117
00:07:43,095 --> 00:07:45,798
on our love for each other…

118
00:07:48,267 --> 00:07:50,937
then perhaps, I will not give up as well.

119
00:07:56,776 --> 00:07:59,011
Well then…

120
00:08:00,379 --> 00:08:05,117
I will forever hold on
to our promise to each other.

121
00:08:17,196 --> 00:08:20,500
But give me time, Maria Clara.

122
00:08:21,601 --> 00:08:23,870
Give me time to get back on my feet.

123
00:08:26,472 --> 00:08:28,541
So I can save you…

124
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:32,812
and live the life we dreamt of,

125
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:35,515
a peaceful life together.

126
00:08:42,588 --> 00:08:44,857
I will come back for you, Maria.

127
00:08:48,461 --> 00:08:50,463
Can you wait for me again?

128
00:09:02,008 --> 00:09:05,745
No matter how long it takes…

129
00:09:10,283 --> 00:09:12,919
I will wait for you, Crisostomo.

130
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,392
As long as you are alive…

131
00:09:21,627 --> 00:09:23,796
I will also live.

132
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:37,843
Take this love of mine with you.

133
00:11:34,326 --> 00:11:35,261
Mother!

134
00:11:35,327 --> 00:11:39,365
My God, don't let him burn my soul!

135
00:11:39,432 --> 00:11:40,766
Mother!

136
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:52,411
Mother?

137
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:01,654
Mother!

138
00:12:05,191 --> 00:12:06,659
Mother?

139
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:13,599
Be on the lookout.

140
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:16,869
Someone should guard
the forest and the lake.

141
00:12:16,936 --> 00:12:20,773
Let's not wait for the sun to rise
before we catch the filibusters!

142
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:23,509
We need to find them right away!

143
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:24,877
Hurry!

144
00:12:24,944 --> 00:12:26,378
Yes, señor.

145
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,384
Mother?

146
00:12:33,152 --> 00:12:34,754
Mother!

147
00:12:39,191 --> 00:12:40,493
Mother…

148
00:12:41,527 --> 00:12:42,995
-You can't.
-Mother.

149
00:12:43,062 --> 00:12:46,532
You are playing
with my heart and mind again!

150
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:48,334
You are playing tricks on me!

151
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:52,471
Mother, it's me. Your son, Basilio.

152
00:12:52,538 --> 00:12:53,973
Leave me alone.

153
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:56,342
I'm so tired!

154
00:12:57,877 --> 00:13:01,213
I'm so tired! I want to break free!

155
00:13:02,081 --> 00:13:04,083
Mother, this is real.

156
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:07,419
This is not a dream.

157
00:13:07,486 --> 00:13:09,722
Leave me alone!

158
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:12,391
-Mother…
-Leave me alone!

159
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,160
Enough already!

160
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:19,965
Leave me alone!

161
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,508
Please don't go.

162
00:13:29,575 --> 00:13:32,878
I don't want to be separated from…

163
00:13:33,913 --> 00:13:35,481
Basilio?

164
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:38,851
Basilio.

165
00:13:46,292 --> 00:13:48,027
Basilio?

166
00:13:53,132 --> 00:13:54,667
My son.

167
00:14:01,307 --> 00:14:05,110
My son!

168
00:14:09,915 --> 00:14:14,119
Basilio, my son.

169
00:14:22,228 --> 00:14:28,367
My son, wake up.

170
00:14:29,602 --> 00:14:33,138
My son…

171
00:14:34,306 --> 00:14:36,375
You're wrong, Elias,

172
00:14:36,442 --> 00:14:39,245
I cannot be happy in another place.

173
00:14:39,311 --> 00:14:41,080
Because wherever I go,

174
00:14:41,146 --> 00:14:45,885
I carry with me
all the grief caused by this country.

175
00:14:45,951 --> 00:14:50,155
Your fate and future lie in your hands.

176
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:53,759
Think about your decision carefully, sir.

177
00:14:53,826 --> 00:14:58,998
But before anything else,
you need to be safe first.

178
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:05,537
I wish I could love you back, Fidel.

179
00:15:07,606 --> 00:15:09,475
I wish I could.

180
00:15:20,452 --> 00:15:21,553
Klay.

181
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:29,028
Klay.

182
00:15:33,032 --> 00:15:35,434
Klay, why don't you try?

183
00:15:39,571 --> 00:15:41,707
Klay, can you please try?

184
00:15:43,342 --> 00:15:49,348
No love will triumph
in a complicated society.

185
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:00,225
Both our worlds are complicated, Fidel.

186
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:05,898
And there's no place
for this kind of love.

187
00:16:13,372 --> 00:16:17,609
So, instead of offering me your love…

188
00:16:19,678 --> 00:16:21,513
offer it to our fellowmen,

189
00:16:23,015 --> 00:16:24,483
to our country.

190
00:16:26,952 --> 00:16:30,089
What do you mean, Ms. Klay?

191
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:38,364
The illness in this story
needs to be healed first.

192
00:16:39,565 --> 00:16:42,368
And as for me, I need to heal my present.

193
00:16:46,138 --> 00:16:47,606
When that happens…

194
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:52,878
maybe.

195
00:16:55,114 --> 00:16:59,118
Maybe, this kind of love can possibly win.

196
00:17:00,552 --> 00:17:02,287
At another time.

197
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:04,223
In another world.

198
00:17:04,289 --> 00:17:05,791
In another universe,

199
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:07,026
I don't know.

200
00:17:14,133 --> 00:17:15,868
Ms. Klay…

201
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:18,337
tonight…

202
00:17:19,605 --> 00:17:21,707
for the very first time…

203
00:17:22,841 --> 00:17:24,243
I killed someone.

204
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:28,247
For our safety…

205
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:30,682
and for others.

206
00:17:35,587 --> 00:17:38,624
How much more blood must be spilled

207
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:42,027
for me to be worthy
of the love you are talking about?

208
00:18:08,854 --> 00:18:10,289
Fire!

209
00:18:17,362 --> 00:18:18,730
Klay!

210
00:18:18,797 --> 00:18:20,099
That was gunfire!

211
00:18:20,165 --> 00:18:21,733
Could it be Sir Ibarra?

212
00:18:42,855 --> 00:18:43,956
Mother?

213
00:19:17,422 --> 00:19:19,958
You were shot.

214
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:40,779
Elias.

215
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:42,814
Mother…

216
00:19:44,116 --> 00:19:46,318
don't leave me.

217
00:19:46,385 --> 00:19:48,520
I'm all alone.

218
00:19:51,089 --> 00:19:53,025
No matter what happens…

219
00:19:55,093 --> 00:19:56,762
we will go home…

220
00:19:57,763 --> 00:19:59,531
to our hut.

221
00:19:59,598 --> 00:20:00,866
Yes, Mother.

222
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:05,170
Let's go home, Basilio.

223
00:20:45,043 --> 00:20:48,046
Mother, we are near our hut.

224
00:20:49,047 --> 00:20:50,749
Take it slow.

225
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:26,818
Mother!

226
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:11,863
Mother?

227
00:22:12,431 --> 00:22:13,298
Mother?

228
00:22:15,133 --> 00:22:16,335
Mother.

229
00:22:19,071 --> 00:22:20,405
Mother.

230
00:22:21,406 --> 00:22:23,775
We are near our hut.

231
00:22:25,077 --> 00:22:26,545
Mother.

232
00:22:29,448 --> 00:22:30,749
Mother.

233
00:22:30,816 --> 00:22:33,452
Mother?

234
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:36,988
Mother!

235
00:22:37,923 --> 00:22:43,762
Mother…

236
00:22:43,829 --> 00:22:46,398
Mother…

237
00:22:46,465 --> 00:22:50,235
Mother…

238
00:22:50,302 --> 00:22:54,973
Mother…

239
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:59,044
Mother…

240
00:22:59,111 --> 00:23:02,147
Mother…

241
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:07,853
Mother…

242
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:15,961
Do you think they have Sir Ibarra?

243
00:23:17,028 --> 00:23:18,964
I don't know either.

244
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:20,799
My God.

245
00:23:20,866 --> 00:23:22,467
Please save them.

246
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:25,170
Please save us.

247
00:23:26,171 --> 00:23:28,140
Klay! Wait, where are you going?

248
00:23:28,206 --> 00:23:29,641
I'm going to Ibarra.

249
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:31,276
No! It's dangerous!

250
00:23:31,343 --> 00:23:33,678
They need our help, Fidel!

251
00:23:38,683 --> 00:23:39,785
All right.

252
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,722
But stay behind me.

253
00:23:45,724 --> 00:23:46,758
Come on.

254
00:24:01,706 --> 00:24:02,741
You've been shot.

255
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:05,744
What are you doing here, sir?

256
00:24:05,811 --> 00:24:07,712
We need to get to the grave.

257
00:24:08,513 --> 00:24:09,548
Let's go…

258
00:24:11,516 --> 00:24:12,417
Here.

259
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:16,888
Here.

260
00:24:21,026 --> 00:24:22,761
Save yourself!

261
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:25,330
What?

262
00:24:26,164 --> 00:24:27,365
Get out of here.

263
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:30,535
They're coming.

264
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:32,471
No.

265
00:24:33,104 --> 00:24:34,873
I won't leave you.

266
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:36,308
What do you want?

267
00:24:37,509 --> 00:24:39,010
For the two of us to die here?

268
00:24:43,248 --> 00:24:44,950
I will save you.

269
00:24:46,518 --> 00:24:49,521
Sir, between the two of us,

270
00:24:49,588 --> 00:24:51,323
it's more important for you to be safe.

271
00:25:03,235 --> 00:25:04,336
Get out of here now.

272
00:25:04,402 --> 00:25:06,705
Save yourself.

273
00:25:06,771 --> 00:25:08,306
Get out of these woods!

274
00:25:09,207 --> 00:25:10,242
Hurry!

275
00:25:29,895 --> 00:25:30,996
Crisostomo?

276
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:34,366
Crisostomo!

277
00:25:39,004 --> 00:25:40,338
Clarita?

278
00:25:41,907 --> 00:25:43,508
-Clarita.
-Auntie.

279
00:25:43,575 --> 00:25:46,077
I heard you shouting.

280
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:50,549
Auntie, I was dreaming.

281
00:25:53,084 --> 00:25:54,486
He was being chased.

282
00:25:55,654 --> 00:25:56,755
Who?

283
00:25:58,456 --> 00:25:59,724
Crisostomo.

284
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:02,093
And then he was shot.

285
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:04,596
It was only a dream.

286
00:26:04,663 --> 00:26:06,498
It wasn't real.

287
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:09,434
But, Auntie…

288
00:26:09,501 --> 00:26:12,337
what if my premonitions are real?

289
00:26:14,773 --> 00:26:17,208
You are only making yourself anxious.

290
00:26:17,275 --> 00:26:19,945
It won't help.

291
00:26:20,011 --> 00:26:25,550
Let's just pray for Crisostomo's safety.

292
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:27,719
All right?

293
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:50,542
Always remember…

294
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:52,844
Mother loves both of you very much.

295
00:26:52,911 --> 00:26:55,413
Stay here. Don't leave me, okay?

296
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:58,116
Let's try to stay out of their sights…

297
00:26:59,484 --> 00:27:01,519
and then we will go back to our hut.

298
00:27:02,187 --> 00:27:03,688
Whatever happens…

299
00:27:03,755 --> 00:27:05,991
You and I, and your brother Crispin,
will all be together

300
00:27:06,057 --> 00:27:07,892
and we're going back to our hut, okay?

301
00:27:23,575 --> 00:27:24,843
Who's there?

302
00:27:28,847 --> 00:27:30,215
Who's there?

303
00:27:34,219 --> 00:27:35,487
Who are you?

304
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:42,394
I'm not a bad person, child.

305
00:27:43,828 --> 00:27:44,929
Sir.

306
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:49,734
Help…

307
00:27:52,003 --> 00:27:53,238
Help me.

308
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:57,242
Get some firewood.

309
00:27:58,510 --> 00:27:59,978
A lot of firewood!

310
00:28:04,115 --> 00:28:06,651
You were shot in the shoulder.

311
00:28:06,718 --> 00:28:09,287
You need to be treated.

312
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:11,623
You might end up like my mother.

313
00:28:19,397 --> 00:28:21,099
Child, my sympathies go out to you.

314
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:23,768
We were both…

315
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:27,906
dealt with the same fate, child.

316
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:33,111
Our lives have become tragic.

317
00:28:34,479 --> 00:28:36,314
But you,

318
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:38,183
you have a chance…

319
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:41,619
to have a better life.

320
00:28:42,654 --> 00:28:44,389
So, be strong.

321
00:28:45,356 --> 00:28:47,025
I don't want to live anymore.

322
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:49,794
They killed my mother…

323
00:28:50,829 --> 00:28:52,297
and my brother.

324
00:28:53,765 --> 00:28:55,500
They took everything from me.

325
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:59,871
There's no reason left for me to live!

326
00:28:59,938 --> 00:29:02,006
Listen to me, child.

327
00:29:02,073 --> 00:29:04,209
Whatever you're feeling right now,

328
00:29:05,443 --> 00:29:06,578
anger…

329
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:09,013
hatred…

330
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:10,815
sorrow…

331
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:13,885
use that…

332
00:29:14,953 --> 00:29:16,154
to keep going…

333
00:29:18,389 --> 00:29:19,524
to fight!

334
00:29:21,526 --> 00:29:26,331
Ignite the fire burning in your heart…

335
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:33,872
because that will give you strength.

336
00:29:45,817 --> 00:29:46,885
Child…

337
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:52,991
you're not safe here.

338
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:55,860
So leave now.

339
00:29:57,695 --> 00:30:00,165
I will take care of your mother.

340
00:30:00,231 --> 00:30:01,432
Go now.

341
00:30:02,767 --> 00:30:03,835
And you…

342
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:06,604
you still have hope.

343
00:30:08,907 --> 00:30:10,909
I can't leave my mother.

344
00:30:18,516 --> 00:30:20,985
Would you rather that
all three of us die here?

345
00:30:22,787 --> 00:30:24,489
I will take care of your mother.

346
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:33,231
Child…

347
00:30:36,134 --> 00:30:37,268
I promise…

348
00:30:40,538 --> 00:30:42,307
I will take care of your mother.

349
00:31:02,493 --> 00:31:03,595
Leave!

350
00:31:05,296 --> 00:31:06,564
Hurry, child.

351
00:31:58,182 --> 00:32:00,218
Father, the civil guards
are currently chasing

352
00:32:00,285 --> 00:32:04,122
Crisostomo Ibarra and the others.

353
00:32:04,188 --> 00:32:06,824
Don't let them escape.

354
00:32:06,891 --> 00:32:08,826
Don't worry, Father.

355
00:32:08,893 --> 00:32:12,063
They are surrounded by civil guards.

356
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:14,866
Only a miracle can save them.

357
00:32:16,701 --> 00:32:18,403
I will give you my blessing.

358
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:22,774
Just shower them with bullets,

359
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:26,277
slash their necks…

360
00:32:26,344 --> 00:32:27,345
or

361
00:32:27,412 --> 00:32:28,880
cut off their heads.

362
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:33,351
Do everything to ensure
they don't get out of here alive.

363
00:32:33,418 --> 00:32:34,452
Do you understand?

364
00:32:35,019 --> 00:32:36,254
Yes, Father.

365
00:32:36,321 --> 00:32:37,522
All right.

366
00:32:39,057 --> 00:32:40,658
Merry Christmas.

367
00:32:41,893 --> 00:32:45,330
May the Lord guide you.

368
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:43,421
Wait.

369
00:33:47,825 --> 00:33:48,860
Elias?

370
00:33:56,134 --> 00:33:58,336
-Elias?
-Salome…

371
00:33:59,937 --> 00:34:01,139
is that you?

372
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:03,608
Elias, it's Klay.

373
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:06,144
Ms. Klay.

374
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:08,880
Where is Ibarra?

375
00:34:15,386 --> 00:34:16,687
My God!

376
00:34:16,754 --> 00:34:18,689
You've been shot!

377
00:34:18,756 --> 00:34:20,625
You will lose a lot of blood!

378
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:24,395
What can I do to help, miss?

379
00:34:24,462 --> 00:34:26,431
Let's make him sit.

380
00:34:26,497 --> 00:34:27,498
Hurry.

381
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:31,035
Go to the other side.

382
00:34:33,037 --> 00:34:33,971
Careful.

383
00:34:34,038 --> 00:34:35,072
Here.

384
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:46,851
Cloth.

385
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:48,619
I need a lot of it.

386
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:51,889
My God, how do I do this?

387
00:34:57,161 --> 00:34:59,664
I thought I only came here
to study Rizal's work.

388
00:35:00,264 --> 00:35:01,532
This is already an internship.

389
00:35:18,349 --> 00:35:19,383
Okay.

390
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:20,518
Put enough pressure.

391
00:35:20,585 --> 00:35:21,452
There on his wound.

392
00:35:23,054 --> 00:35:24,255
Press harder.

393
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:27,992
Elias, we're doing this
to stop the bleeding.

394
00:35:29,227 --> 00:35:30,695
Wait, what happened?

395
00:35:30,761 --> 00:35:32,530
We were waiting for you at the graveyard.

396
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:35,433
We were about to escape…

397
00:35:38,169 --> 00:35:40,104
but they suddenly found us.

398
00:35:43,407 --> 00:35:45,343
Right. Where is Ibarra?

399
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,314
I don't know.

400
00:35:51,782 --> 00:35:52,884
What?

401
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:54,785
What do you mean you don't know?

402
00:35:54,852 --> 00:35:56,587
You were together, weren't you?

403
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:00,291
We got separated.

404
00:36:11,736 --> 00:36:13,037
That belongs to Ibarra.

405
00:36:14,105 --> 00:36:16,541
Maria gave that to him.

406
00:36:16,607 --> 00:36:17,808
Why do you have it?

407
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:22,380
Elias…

408
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:26,751
is Ibarra still alive?

409
00:36:39,597 --> 00:36:41,232
No.

410
00:37:13,698 --> 00:37:16,334
He's the hero of the story, he cannot die.

411
00:37:18,502 --> 00:37:19,804
I let him escape.

412
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:24,709
May protection….

413
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:28,679
May protection be on his side.

414
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:30,982
Because if not…

415
00:37:31,048 --> 00:37:32,717
Okay!

416
00:37:32,783 --> 00:37:34,719
That's good! So you let him escape.

417
00:37:34,785 --> 00:37:36,387
So he is alive?

418
00:37:36,454 --> 00:37:38,189
Right? He must live.

419
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:40,625
You must all live!

420
00:37:40,691 --> 00:37:41,692
Klay…

421
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:46,097
And if you both must live…

422
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:49,467
escape now.

423
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:53,471
Go now and leave me.

424
00:37:54,839 --> 00:37:58,376
Let me do what I came here for.

425
00:38:00,011 --> 00:38:01,646
No.

426
00:38:01,712 --> 00:38:03,614
We will treat your wound.

427
00:38:03,681 --> 00:38:04,949
Fidel, help me.

428
00:38:07,752 --> 00:38:08,753
No!

429
00:38:13,691 --> 00:38:15,059
Leave me!

430
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:17,228
And then what?

431
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:18,963
Will we just let you die here?

432
00:38:20,398 --> 00:38:22,066
Thank you for your concern.

433
00:38:23,267 --> 00:38:26,137
But I cannot leave the woman.

434
00:38:27,772 --> 00:38:29,440
I promised.

435
00:38:29,507 --> 00:38:30,708
Which woman?

436
00:38:33,411 --> 00:38:34,979
Ms. Sisa.

437
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:53,898
Ms. Sisa.

438
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:58,436
Ms. Sisa.

439
00:39:10,314 --> 00:39:11,949
I'm sure he was hit directly.

440
00:39:26,664 --> 00:39:28,866
In that case, we can catch them quickly.

441
00:39:29,433 --> 00:39:31,035
Move faster! Hurry! Before they get away!

442
00:39:31,102 --> 00:39:32,103
Yes, señor!

443
00:39:38,809 --> 00:39:40,378
This is too much!

444
00:39:40,444 --> 00:39:42,213
This is too much!
I don't want this anymore!

445
00:39:42,279 --> 00:39:43,948
Let go of me!

446
00:39:44,014 --> 00:39:45,249
Klay, please calm down.

447
00:39:45,316 --> 00:39:47,785
Look what's happening!

448
00:39:47,852 --> 00:39:50,121
Is Rizal mad at his characters?

449
00:39:52,356 --> 00:39:53,357
What?

450
00:39:54,792 --> 00:39:57,027
He's killing them off one by one.

451
00:39:58,496 --> 00:40:00,564
Even the innocent ones.

452
00:40:01,732 --> 00:40:03,701
He even outdid GOT!

453
00:40:06,303 --> 00:40:08,672
I don't know
what you are referring to, miss.

454
00:40:12,977 --> 00:40:15,813
Why did they have to die?

455
00:40:19,717 --> 00:40:21,218
First, it was Crispin.

456
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:25,189
Now, it's Ms. Sisa.

457
00:40:27,858 --> 00:40:29,794
Elias is fighting for his life.

458
00:40:30,361 --> 00:40:31,362
Sir Ibarra…

459
00:40:33,497 --> 00:40:34,865
I don't know.

460
00:40:36,367 --> 00:40:38,002
They don't deserve to die.

461
00:40:38,068 --> 00:40:39,970
None of you deserve to die.

462
00:40:41,138 --> 00:40:45,943
Klay, we're not sure if Ibarra is gone.

463
00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:48,846
And, you will still tend to Elias, right?

464
00:40:48,913 --> 00:40:52,016
Please leave now
if you will just be making noise.

465
00:40:53,551 --> 00:40:55,152
They are coming.

466
00:40:56,387 --> 00:40:57,788
Just leave me.

467
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:00,891
Wait a second.

468
00:41:02,226 --> 00:41:04,128
Why are you saying that?

469
00:41:05,429 --> 00:41:07,731
Do we really have no control?

470
00:41:07,798 --> 00:41:09,667
Is it that simple?

471
00:41:10,167 --> 00:41:12,837
Fidel, your friend is missing.
Ibarra is missing.

472
00:41:12,903 --> 00:41:14,738
Why do you still look so chill?

473
00:41:16,674 --> 00:41:18,142
What do you mean by "chill"?

474
00:41:19,376 --> 00:41:22,780
Are you saying
that I am not doing anything?

475
00:41:22,847 --> 00:41:24,648
What kind of friend are you?

476
00:41:26,283 --> 00:41:28,319
Why are you not concerned at all?

477
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:31,021
You're so calm.

478
00:41:32,056 --> 00:41:34,625
Do all of these mean nothing to you?

479
00:41:34,692 --> 00:41:35,860
Please…

480
00:41:35,926 --> 00:41:38,028
Do you think
you're the only one who's hurting?

481
00:41:39,697 --> 00:41:42,199
This is painful for me too, Ms. Klay.

482
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:44,768
It's painful for me that…

483
00:41:46,237 --> 00:41:48,939
I might lose my best friend.

484
00:41:50,274 --> 00:41:52,877
He's the only one
whom I consider family here.

485
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:58,916
You just don't see it,
but my heart is breaking.

486
00:41:58,983 --> 00:42:03,621
But I have to remain strong
because someone is chasing us.

487
00:42:03,687 --> 00:42:07,291
This is not the time to sulk, Ms. Klay.

488
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:08,993
We have to be alert…

489
00:42:10,227 --> 00:42:12,229
and I need to protect you.

490
00:42:14,098 --> 00:42:15,866
Because if I lose you too…

491
00:42:17,468 --> 00:42:19,470
I might not be able to bear it.

492
00:42:27,578 --> 00:42:29,113
Señor,

493
00:42:29,179 --> 00:42:31,549
we saw someone over there.

494
00:42:31,615 --> 00:42:33,317
It could be them.

495
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:35,553
I already sent some men over there.

496
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:37,955
Move faster.

497
00:42:38,022 --> 00:42:39,056
Hurry up!

498
00:42:39,123 --> 00:42:40,424
Before they get away!

499
00:42:40,491 --> 00:42:41,725
Yes, señor.

500
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:51,602
We will all die here…

501
00:42:52,503 --> 00:42:54,305
if you don't stop!

502
00:42:57,107 --> 00:42:59,009
Well then, promise me something, Fidel.

503
00:43:01,111 --> 00:43:02,146
Promise you what?

504
00:43:04,949 --> 00:43:07,418
Promise me that you will not die.

505
00:43:14,758 --> 00:43:15,893
Promise.

506
00:43:18,329 --> 00:43:19,330
Who's there?

507
00:43:20,331 --> 00:43:21,999
Hands up!

508
00:43:22,066 --> 00:43:23,534
Don't move!

509
00:43:26,971 --> 00:43:28,706
Stay behind me, Ms. Klay.

510
00:43:33,410 --> 00:43:35,446
I will not let them hurt you.

511
00:43:36,413 --> 00:43:38,082
They will have to go through me first.

512
00:43:52,062 --> 00:43:53,197
Ali?

513
00:44:21,692 --> 00:44:25,796
Most of the time,
a dream is the opposite of reality.

514
00:44:26,363 --> 00:44:28,932
<i>That's why I am sure
that Crisostomo is safe.</i>

515
00:44:28,999 --> 00:44:30,167
Sir Ibarra!

516
00:44:30,234 --> 00:44:31,435
This is Klay!

517
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:32,770
Klay, come on.

518
00:44:32,836 --> 00:44:34,438
Someone might hear us.

519
00:44:34,505 --> 00:44:37,541
Please! I don't want
to stay silent anymore!

520
00:44:37,608 --> 00:44:38,676
My whole life,

521
00:44:39,877 --> 00:44:42,179
I've always been told
to keep my mouth shut.

522
00:44:42,246 --> 00:44:43,681
Now, tell me, Father.

523
00:44:43,747 --> 00:44:45,382
Admit…

524
00:44:45,449 --> 00:44:48,752
the role you played
in ruining Crisostomo's life.

525
00:44:48,819 --> 00:44:50,287
COMING UP

526
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:51,555
Speak up!

527
00:44:58,495 --> 00:45:01,365
