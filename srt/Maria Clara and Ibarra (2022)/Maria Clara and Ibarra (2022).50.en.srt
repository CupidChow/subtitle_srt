1
00:00:30,597 --> 00:00:34,234
MARIA CLARA AND IBARRA

2
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:37,971
THIS PROGRAM, WHICH IS ADAPTED
FROM THE NOVELS OF DR. JOSE P. RIZAL,

3
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:41,674
IS PRESENTED USING DRAMATIC ELEMENTS
TO CONNECT THE PRESENT AND THE PAST

4
00:00:41,741 --> 00:00:46,379
IN A SPECIAL REIMAGINING OF THE NATIONAL
LITERATURE FILIPINOS ARE PROUD OF.

5
00:00:46,446 --> 00:00:48,782
<i>I can finally pay them back
in exchange for your freedom.</i>

6
00:00:48,848 --> 00:00:52,552
<i>My friends pooled their money
so that I can take you back home.</i>

7
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:54,054
<i>Oh, Basilio.</i>

8
00:00:54,854 --> 00:00:55,989
<i>What happened?</i>

9
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:57,057
<i>He had too much opium.</i>

10
00:00:57,123 --> 00:00:58,024
<i>Aren't you a doctor?</i>

11
00:00:58,091 --> 00:00:59,893
<i>Do something!</i>

12
00:00:59,959 --> 00:01:03,663
Don't leave me, Tiago!

13
00:01:05,298 --> 00:01:07,033
<i>Forgive me for what I have done.</i>

14
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:11,704
<i>I sold your necklace
in exchange for justice</i>

15
00:01:11,771 --> 00:01:13,206
<i>and for your safety as well.</i>

16
00:01:13,273 --> 00:01:17,677
I hope the news I am about to tell you
can ease your sadness.

17
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:18,945
What news?

18
00:01:19,012 --> 00:01:21,815
<i>Your daughter is dead.</i>

19
00:01:21,881 --> 00:01:27,754
It is time for you to say goodbye.

20
00:01:27,821 --> 00:01:30,023
Crisostomo Ibarra?

21
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:31,424
Melchor--

22
00:01:31,491 --> 00:01:33,026
PREVIOUSLY…

23
00:01:35,128 --> 00:01:40,500
I am blessing you
with endless suffering in hell!

24
00:01:40,567 --> 00:01:41,668
Until we meet again.

25
00:01:41,734 --> 00:01:46,873
The son of the devil has run out of love.

26
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:00,854
May Christ, who died for your sins,

27
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,323
accept you in the garden of paradise.

28
00:02:05,091 --> 00:02:07,894
May He forgive your sins…

29
00:02:08,928 --> 00:02:12,499
and welcome you to the garden of paradise.

30
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,236
May you experience God's grace.

31
00:02:23,176 --> 00:02:27,914
Tiago was such a kind father
and an upstanding citizen.

32
00:02:28,948 --> 00:02:32,886
What happened to him was unfortunate,

33
00:02:33,453 --> 00:02:37,790
but he is now with the Lord.

34
00:02:41,794 --> 00:02:44,898
Thank you for coming, Father.

35
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:48,101
Let me walk you out.

36
00:03:28,908 --> 00:03:30,009
Mother?

37
00:04:46,185 --> 00:04:48,354
Basilio, what happened here?

38
00:04:51,524 --> 00:04:52,458
Is that…

39
00:04:53,559 --> 00:04:54,961
Captain Tiago?

40
00:04:57,397 --> 00:04:58,331
Gone.

41
00:05:00,566 --> 00:05:01,768
He's already gone.

42
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:12,312
I'm late.

43
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,615
I got here too late.

44
00:05:17,684 --> 00:05:20,420
Captain Tiago's chapter
has already happened.

45
00:05:31,531 --> 00:05:33,299
My condolences, Basilio.

46
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:51,417
He was like a father to me.

47
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,359
He took me in…

48
00:06:01,894 --> 00:06:04,163
like I'm his own son.

49
00:06:06,966 --> 00:06:10,103
He was the one who helped me
so I could study medicine.

50
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:17,377
That's why I am very grateful to him.

51
00:06:22,081 --> 00:06:24,817
But during the last moments of his life…

52
00:06:28,755 --> 00:06:31,190
I wasn't even able to save him.

53
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:46,939
You did everything you could, Basilio.

54
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:54,147
I'm sure that Captain Tiago
is also grateful to you.

55
00:06:58,484 --> 00:06:59,552
But…

56
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:05,191
I think that he also wants to be
with Maria Clara and Doña Pia already.

57
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:06,392
Right?

58
00:07:08,194 --> 00:07:11,597
I'm sure that he's very happy now.

59
00:07:28,981 --> 00:07:32,518
Ever since Señorita Maria Clara
entered the monastery,

60
00:07:35,488 --> 00:07:37,056
he lost hope.

61
00:07:40,726 --> 00:07:42,628
<i>It's as if he was just waiting for death.</i>

62
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:49,902
That's why he chose
to become addicted to opium.

63
00:07:58,010 --> 00:07:59,912
Because of that poison, Klay,

64
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:04,050
I lost my second father.

65
00:08:35,548 --> 00:08:37,984
"It was a poison that ended our lives.

66
00:08:38,951 --> 00:08:41,220
Poison brought about
by the Philippine Islands.

67
00:08:41,721 --> 00:08:43,623
You need to choose, Bas…

68
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:47,326
Basilio.

69
00:08:48,394 --> 00:08:51,364
Are you on the side
of the cure for our country…

70
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:53,232
or are you on the side of the poison?

71
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:56,002
With love, S."

72
00:08:59,238 --> 00:09:00,706
It's Señor Simoun.

73
00:09:06,979 --> 00:09:08,414
What kind of ploy is this?

74
00:09:09,615 --> 00:09:11,517
An ally of the country's cure?

75
00:09:12,084 --> 00:09:14,720
If you join forces with Simoun,

76
00:09:14,787 --> 00:09:16,923
what kind of cure for the country

77
00:09:16,989 --> 00:09:19,292
is one that's caused by manipulation,

78
00:09:19,358 --> 00:09:21,360
personal hatred, and revenge?

79
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:31,837
Basilio, don't listen to this.

80
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:33,472
Don't listen to him.

81
00:09:34,473 --> 00:09:36,309
Whatever happens. Do you understand?

82
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,512
For your sake.

83
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:41,113
For everyone's sake.

84
00:09:43,349 --> 00:09:44,884
Just think of Juli…

85
00:09:46,185 --> 00:09:48,387
and the many people who will be involved.

86
00:09:52,024 --> 00:09:54,226
Basilio, look at me. Are you listening?

87
00:10:04,303 --> 00:10:05,605
Thank God.

88
00:10:08,474 --> 00:10:10,009
Oh, this is driving me crazy.

89
00:10:10,076 --> 00:10:12,378
Simoun is still pushing through
with his deceptive scheme.

90
00:10:14,213 --> 00:10:15,081
It can't be.

91
00:10:21,687 --> 00:10:24,223
What was written in the book
must not happen.

92
00:10:29,161 --> 00:10:30,229
That book…

93
00:10:33,733 --> 00:10:36,602
it's better if you take
that book back, Klay.

94
00:10:38,537 --> 00:10:39,572
Because…

95
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:42,274
there are more mysterious things

96
00:10:42,341 --> 00:10:44,977
that happened to it
since you gave it to me.

97
00:10:46,912 --> 00:10:48,547
More mysterious things?

98
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:53,486
Can anything else be worse
than what's happening now?

99
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:15,641
Klay, why didn't you download
the online version?

100
00:11:16,776 --> 00:11:18,944
You don't even have a reference now.

101
00:11:20,046 --> 00:11:21,947
There's no Internet connection here.

102
00:11:23,215 --> 00:11:24,417
Klay…

103
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:28,287
how did it suddenly disappear?

104
00:11:30,322 --> 00:11:31,424
Deleted…

105
00:11:32,558 --> 00:11:34,527
erased, canceled!

106
00:11:35,394 --> 00:11:37,063
We haven't even reached the end yet.

107
00:11:39,398 --> 00:11:40,766
Basilio said

108
00:11:42,835 --> 00:11:46,639
that the text will only reappear

109
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:49,909
if the events have already transpired.

110
00:11:56,182 --> 00:11:59,618
Mr. Torres' book is driving me crazy!

111
00:12:04,523 --> 00:12:05,458
Hold on.

112
00:12:06,158 --> 00:12:07,093
So if…

113
00:12:09,962 --> 00:12:11,530
If it hasn't happened yet…

114
00:12:13,699 --> 00:12:15,634
does it mean
that it can still be prevented?

115
00:12:15,701 --> 00:12:16,802
And…

116
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:19,438
it can still be changed.

117
00:12:20,372 --> 00:12:21,540
Yes, because…

118
00:12:22,641 --> 00:12:25,044
Elias was supposed to be dead in <i>Noli.</i>

119
00:12:25,111 --> 00:12:26,812
But here, he's still alive, right?

120
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:32,551
It means that we're already
altering the narrative.

121
00:12:33,552 --> 00:12:37,156
And what I read before might never happen.

122
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,394
How about Simoun?

123
00:12:43,829 --> 00:12:45,664
What can happen to him?

124
00:12:49,235 --> 00:12:51,403
His mind can still change.

125
00:12:53,572 --> 00:12:54,507
Right.

126
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:01,247
I hope he'll change his mind.

127
00:13:01,313 --> 00:13:02,314
Or perhaps…

128
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:05,518
he has a new plan.

129
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:10,790
We can probably change
what he's about to do.

130
00:13:11,891 --> 00:13:15,694
But can his mindset
and emotions still change,

131
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:20,833
especially now that he failed
to urge Basilio to help him?

132
00:13:31,343 --> 00:13:33,245
Our deepest sympathies, Basilio.

133
00:13:34,346 --> 00:13:37,917
I know that Captain Tiago
was like a second father to you.

134
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:44,523
If it were not for him,

135
00:13:46,358 --> 00:13:48,260
I wouldn't have had the chance
to study medicine.

136
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:53,899
That is why I thank
Captain Tiago wholeheartedly.

137
00:13:57,803 --> 00:13:59,004
I just think that…

138
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:05,444
he is now reunited with Maria Clara
and Doña Pia in the afterlife.

139
00:14:09,448 --> 00:14:11,584
On the other hand, it's good to know

140
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:13,719
that you were able
to bring Juli back to their home.

141
00:14:15,988 --> 00:14:17,156
That's right,

142
00:14:18,057 --> 00:14:19,391
and that's because of all of you.

143
00:14:20,593 --> 00:14:21,894
Thank you very much, my friends.

144
00:14:22,728 --> 00:14:24,797
Don't think about it, my friend.

145
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:28,601
What's important is that
our loved ones are with us.

146
00:14:29,668 --> 00:14:33,739
If there's a chance, the four of us,
you, me, Juli, and Paulita,

147
00:14:34,473 --> 00:14:36,242
should go to the lake in San Diego.

148
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:38,777
Wow.

149
00:14:39,411 --> 00:14:40,512
That's a good idea.

150
00:14:42,147 --> 00:14:44,950
But let's end this celebration first.

151
00:14:51,156 --> 00:14:52,491
Attention!

152
00:14:54,960 --> 00:15:01,066
Noodles, in honor of the genuine support
of Don Custodio.

153
00:15:03,969 --> 00:15:06,705
For the young people with goodwill

154
00:15:07,506 --> 00:15:09,875
who trusted that he would help us.

155
00:15:13,012 --> 00:15:15,547
For equality.

156
00:15:15,614 --> 00:15:17,983
For the death of a dream.

157
00:15:18,851 --> 00:15:19,985
Foolishness!

158
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:27,793
Enough with the tears and laughter.

159
00:15:28,627 --> 00:15:30,095
Long live stir-fried noodles!

160
00:15:30,162 --> 00:15:31,931
-Long live!
-Long live!

161
00:15:36,368 --> 00:15:37,202
Let's eat.

162
00:15:38,704 --> 00:15:40,572
Run! Civil guards are coming!

163
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:44,510
Basilio, run!

164
00:15:45,811 --> 00:15:46,679
<i>Let's go! Hurry!</i>

165
00:15:51,183 --> 00:15:52,051
You are under arrest!

166
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:52,952
Hold on!

167
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:56,255
Why are you arresting me?
I did not do anything wrong!

168
00:15:56,322 --> 00:15:58,657
You are distributing seditious posters.

169
00:15:58,724 --> 00:15:59,892
What?

170
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:01,927
There is no truth to that!

171
00:16:01,994 --> 00:16:03,195
I am not doing anything wrong!

172
00:16:15,908 --> 00:16:16,976
He's there.

173
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,045
Make it quick.

174
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:23,382
Basilio?

175
00:16:23,449 --> 00:16:24,416
My beloved.

176
00:16:25,551 --> 00:16:28,120
Isagani told me what happened.

177
00:16:28,187 --> 00:16:29,154
How is he?

178
00:16:30,055 --> 00:16:30,956
Is he safe?

179
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:33,425
He is staying with his uncle.

180
00:16:34,426 --> 00:16:36,462
You are still thinking of others, my love,

181
00:16:37,262 --> 00:16:40,165
when it is you who is imprisoned.

182
00:16:41,533 --> 00:16:43,435
Isagani told me

183
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:46,338
that this is connected
with the academy that's being built

184
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:50,175
and with the seditious posters
you didn't make.

185
00:16:51,643 --> 00:16:53,679
But you haven't done anything wrong.

186
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:55,481
They are mistaken.

187
00:16:56,048 --> 00:16:57,750
I will talk to them.

188
00:16:57,816 --> 00:16:59,618
-I will explain to them--
-Juli…

189
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,988
They will also not listen to you.

190
00:17:04,556 --> 00:17:06,492
Do not waste your time.

191
00:17:07,926 --> 00:17:08,994
No.

192
00:17:09,561 --> 00:17:11,296
I must help you.

193
00:17:12,998 --> 00:17:14,333
No need, my beloved.

194
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:16,001
Don't worry.

195
00:17:17,736 --> 00:17:19,304
I will find a way.

196
00:17:20,739 --> 00:17:23,642
It's always you
who is finding a way, Basilio.

197
00:17:24,843 --> 00:17:26,145
In paying off my debt,

198
00:17:27,146 --> 00:17:29,715
in consoling me for the trials
that my family has faced,

199
00:17:29,782 --> 00:17:31,016
in everything, Basilio.

200
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:34,019
It was you who paid off my debt
for my freedom.

201
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:37,122
That's also what I will do, Basilio.

202
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,359
I will get you out of here.

203
00:17:41,527 --> 00:17:42,761
I promise you.

204
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:05,317
Good day, Father.

205
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:07,352
Poor lady.

206
00:18:08,287 --> 00:18:09,388
Come here.

207
00:18:17,496 --> 00:18:19,998
I already asked for help
from Sister Penchang.

208
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:24,570
But I need immediate help, Father,

209
00:18:26,338 --> 00:18:28,173
that the others cannot give.

210
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:31,276
Please help me, Father.

211
00:18:33,812 --> 00:18:35,314
I apologize for the trouble.

212
00:18:36,748 --> 00:18:37,649
No.

213
00:18:39,751 --> 00:18:40,652
Sit down.

214
00:18:46,492 --> 00:18:51,597
You told me that if I need help,
I can come to you, Father.

215
00:18:52,164 --> 00:18:54,099
I need your help now.

216
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:58,137
I am desperate, Father.
I beg you, please help me.

217
00:18:58,637 --> 00:18:59,905
Yes.

218
00:19:00,939 --> 00:19:04,543
You can come to me anytime.

219
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:06,245
What is your problem?

220
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:08,780
My fiancé was arrested.

221
00:19:08,847 --> 00:19:10,015
Basilio.

222
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:14,019
The civil guards imprisoned him.

223
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,389
But he did not do anything wrong, Father.

224
00:19:18,223 --> 00:19:20,292
He was falsely accused.

225
00:19:20,859 --> 00:19:23,428
Father, can you help me free Basilio?

226
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:26,832
I beg you, Father. I am begging you.

227
00:19:26,899 --> 00:19:28,100
Please have pity.

228
00:19:29,535 --> 00:19:30,469
Yes.

229
00:19:31,803 --> 00:19:33,605
I can help your fiancé.

230
00:19:35,874 --> 00:19:38,377
I will write to the chief,

231
00:19:38,443 --> 00:19:43,615
and by sunrise tomorrow, he can freely go.

232
00:19:45,117 --> 00:19:46,151
Really, Father?

233
00:19:47,419 --> 00:19:49,354
You are so kind, Father!

234
00:19:49,421 --> 00:19:51,890
I will consider this
a huge debt of gratitude, Father.

235
00:19:52,724 --> 00:19:57,129
Anything for my poor angel.

236
00:19:57,896 --> 00:20:00,165
Just obey me, my poor angel.

237
00:20:00,732 --> 00:20:02,367
I will even give you heaven.

238
00:20:09,107 --> 00:20:10,042
Klay!

239
00:20:10,943 --> 00:20:12,811
Klay, you cannot go to the prison cells.

240
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:14,646
You just got out of there, remember?

241
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:16,682
I must go to Basilio.

242
00:20:16,748 --> 00:20:20,219
Do you want to be arrested
and imprisoned again

243
00:20:20,285 --> 00:20:21,653
when I had just saved you?

244
00:20:29,695 --> 00:20:32,030
I already finished reading the whole book

245
00:20:33,298 --> 00:20:35,033
but I still missed something.

246
00:20:39,204 --> 00:20:40,272
If only I had prevented it,

247
00:20:40,339 --> 00:20:43,609
there would've been no reason for Basilio
to be involved and get imprisoned.

248
00:20:45,477 --> 00:20:47,212
I had so many chances

249
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:51,350
to change the story
but it is still not enough.

250
00:20:55,287 --> 00:20:56,388
I have even already accepted

251
00:20:56,455 --> 00:20:59,258
that I can no longer expect
any character development from Simoun.

252
00:21:00,325 --> 00:21:03,962
But at least for Basilio,
I hope I can do something.

253
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:08,533
Klay, I understand.

254
00:21:10,068 --> 00:21:12,337
But please do not be hasty.

255
00:21:13,639 --> 00:21:16,008
There will always be another way.

256
00:21:22,981 --> 00:21:24,149
Let's talk about this.

257
00:21:25,384 --> 00:21:26,818
What can we do?

258
00:21:29,087 --> 00:21:32,891
What will happen next in the book?

259
00:21:43,735 --> 00:21:45,270
Nothing is written anymore.

260
00:21:46,905 --> 00:21:47,739
But…

261
00:21:49,074 --> 00:21:51,576
after Basilio's imprisonment…

262
00:22:00,552 --> 00:22:01,553
It's Juli.

263
00:22:03,288 --> 00:22:05,324
Fidel, something bad will happen to Juli.

264
00:22:08,527 --> 00:22:12,331
What does the disciple of God
really want me to do, Father?

265
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:18,070
I think you already know what I mean.

266
00:22:24,609 --> 00:22:26,345
Forgive me, Father.

267
00:22:26,411 --> 00:22:27,646
I need to go now.

268
00:22:27,713 --> 00:22:29,247
I will ask for help from someone else.

269
00:22:29,314 --> 00:22:30,816
Forgive me for taking up your time.

270
00:22:30,882 --> 00:22:31,817
You're not leaving!

271
00:22:31,883 --> 00:22:33,218
Father!

272
00:22:34,619 --> 00:22:38,623
Don't you wish to get
your beloved out of prison?

273
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:40,525
I can do that.

274
00:22:40,592 --> 00:22:43,662
I have a lot of connections.

275
00:22:43,729 --> 00:22:45,931
Just one word from me and

276
00:22:45,997 --> 00:22:48,633
you can be reunited with your fiancé.

277
00:22:49,735 --> 00:22:51,169
Isn't that what you want?

278
00:22:52,471 --> 00:22:55,140
So give me what I want.

279
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:57,075
Let me go, Father.

280
00:22:57,809 --> 00:22:59,010
Let me go.

281
00:23:03,749 --> 00:23:05,050
Your honor

282
00:23:05,117 --> 00:23:07,819
in exchange for your beloved's freedom.

283
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:11,757
I am not that kind of woman, Father!

284
00:23:11,823 --> 00:23:14,292
You are testing my patience!

285
00:23:22,768 --> 00:23:24,503
Where are you taking me?

286
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:25,670
You may go now.

287
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,041
Really?

288
00:23:30,108 --> 00:23:31,143
Yes.

289
00:23:31,209 --> 00:23:32,944
It's the Captain General's order.

290
00:23:34,613 --> 00:23:36,815
It seems that Juli found a way.

291
00:23:39,017 --> 00:23:40,118
Thank you.

292
00:23:40,185 --> 00:23:42,687
Thank the Brown Cardinal.

293
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:46,658
He personally processed
the papers for your release.

294
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:48,760
Señor Simoun?

295
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:53,965
He wants you to have this.

296
00:24:11,983 --> 00:24:15,821
YOUR FREEDOM IN EXCHANGE
FOR THE RENEWAL OF RACE…

297
00:24:16,388 --> 00:24:18,223
ALL RACES…

298
00:24:57,863 --> 00:25:01,500
<i>No one will believe you anyway.</i>

299
00:25:01,566 --> 00:25:04,135
<i>They will think that you're crazy.</i>

300
00:25:05,437 --> 00:25:10,275
She used to be the most beautiful
woman in San Diego.

301
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:12,577
She was raped by a priest.

302
00:25:12,644 --> 00:25:14,079
<i>Basilio, I'm scared.</i>

303
00:25:14,145 --> 00:25:17,682
I'm scared that what happened
to Maria Clara will also happen to me.

304
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:02,127
Juli.

305
00:26:02,193 --> 00:26:04,429
-Who are you?
-I beg you.

306
00:26:04,496 --> 00:26:06,097
-Who are you?
-Don't kill yourself.

307
00:26:06,164 --> 00:26:08,833
-Just let me end my life!
-No, Juli!

308
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,835
Juli.

309
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:12,771
Don't give up on life.

310
00:26:12,837 --> 00:26:15,907
I don't deserve to live anymore.

311
00:26:18,877 --> 00:26:20,478
That's not true.

312
00:26:20,545 --> 00:26:21,613
That's not true.

313
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,815
I'm begging you. Don't kill yourself.

314
00:26:24,983 --> 00:26:27,052
I am a very filthy woman!

315
00:26:27,118 --> 00:26:29,688
-No.
-Just let me end my life!

316
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:30,922
No, Juli!

317
00:26:30,989 --> 00:26:33,325
Juli, listen to me.
You're not a filthy woman.

318
00:26:34,626 --> 00:26:36,962
Whatever monstrosity they did to you,

319
00:26:37,028 --> 00:26:39,931
don't let that dictate your life.

320
00:26:39,998 --> 00:26:44,669
You don't know what I've been through!

321
00:26:44,736 --> 00:26:48,273
He violated me!
You don't know what I've been through!

322
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:49,975
He violated me!

323
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:02,020
He violated me.

324
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,095
I know.

325
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:14,499
Believe me, I know.

326
00:27:17,335 --> 00:27:20,805
What happened to you is tragic.

327
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:26,211
They took away your honor

328
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:31,082
and your dignity.

329
00:27:33,084 --> 00:27:37,255
And as women,
that is heartbreaking for us.

330
00:27:40,191 --> 00:27:42,293
But, Juli,

331
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:45,563
don't let them win.

332
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:47,465
Fight back

333
00:27:47,532 --> 00:27:49,300
while there is still hope.

334
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,309
This shouldn't have happened to you.

335
00:28:01,913 --> 00:28:05,283
Don't ever believe
that this was your fault.

336
00:28:09,954 --> 00:28:11,589
I promise you…

337
00:28:13,158 --> 00:28:17,562
We will make those animals pay.

338
00:28:21,499 --> 00:28:23,868
We will not take this sitting down.

339
00:28:32,343 --> 00:28:36,047
If you think that you are all alone,
you are mistaken.

340
00:28:38,983 --> 00:28:41,019
Many people love you.

341
00:28:43,455 --> 00:28:45,990
I am here for you.

342
00:28:48,593 --> 00:28:51,963
As a woman, I also want to help you.

343
00:28:53,832 --> 00:28:58,336
Because women help each other.

344
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:06,544
Just think of the people
who love you, Juli.

345
00:29:10,215 --> 00:29:11,683
Your father…

346
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:15,887
Basilio…

347
00:29:19,224 --> 00:29:22,127
Their hearts will be broken if you die.

348
00:29:23,695 --> 00:29:25,930
But you will be united…

349
00:29:27,398 --> 00:29:30,368
if you draw strength from each other.

350
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:37,776
Juli, if you will allow me,

351
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:42,080
let me help you.

352
00:29:45,683 --> 00:29:48,486
Because many people love you.

353
00:30:07,038 --> 00:30:09,707
How do you think their talk is going?

354
00:30:19,417 --> 00:30:20,418
-Basilio?
-He's an animal.

355
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:21,686
-Basilio…
-He's an animal.

356
00:30:21,753 --> 00:30:23,288
-Basilio, Basilio!
-He's an animal!

357
00:30:23,354 --> 00:30:24,656
Basilio.

358
00:30:24,722 --> 00:30:26,858
Basilio, calm down.

359
00:30:28,359 --> 00:30:30,562
I will kill that demon!

360
00:30:31,629 --> 00:30:35,200
Father Camorra will regret
what he did to Juli!

361
00:30:36,301 --> 00:30:37,368
Basilio, calm down.

362
00:30:37,435 --> 00:30:40,205
Do not act hastily.

363
00:30:40,271 --> 00:30:41,973
Just keep in mind
that what's important now

364
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,541
is that she's alive!

365
00:30:43,608 --> 00:30:46,010
She still has a chance to heal.

366
00:30:46,077 --> 00:30:47,946
To recover with you!

367
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:50,081
She's alive, Basilio!

368
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:55,320
If so…

369
00:30:58,556 --> 00:31:00,859
I will make sure it stays that way.

370
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,328
Right.

371
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:07,131
I will make sure…

372
00:31:07,732 --> 00:31:10,468
that this will never happen again.

373
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:14,639
No one else will be taken advantage of…

374
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:18,610
and no one else will die…

375
00:31:20,979 --> 00:31:23,948
because of those evil friars!

376
00:31:25,316 --> 00:31:28,086
They took everything from me!

377
00:31:35,326 --> 00:31:36,828
Those colonizers

378
00:31:37,629 --> 00:31:42,567
who abuse their power
to make us Filipinos suffer!

379
00:31:42,634 --> 00:31:44,369
No.

380
00:31:44,435 --> 00:31:46,137
That's wrong, Basilio!

381
00:31:47,705 --> 00:31:49,007
Think carefully.

382
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:50,675
No, this is wrong!

383
00:31:52,443 --> 00:31:56,114
I will make sure
that this will never happen again!

384
00:31:58,349 --> 00:32:01,119
That's wrong, Basilio!
What are you even thinking?

385
00:32:04,622 --> 00:32:05,456
Klay…

386
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:09,794
Watch over Juli.

387
00:32:09,861 --> 00:32:11,562
No!

388
00:32:12,463 --> 00:32:14,933
Basilio, we've already rewritten
what's going to happen!

389
00:32:14,999 --> 00:32:17,302
You can't go to Simoun!

390
00:32:17,368 --> 00:32:19,170
Think about this carefully!

391
00:32:21,472 --> 00:32:23,141
Watch over Juli!

392
00:32:23,207 --> 00:32:24,842
-Basilio!
-Basilio!

393
00:32:24,909 --> 00:32:27,078
Basilio, don't go to Simoun!

394
00:33:06,951 --> 00:33:09,620
"Chapter 33,

395
00:33:10,855 --> 00:33:12,323
The Final Argument."

396
00:33:34,645 --> 00:33:36,014
No.

397
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:38,216
This can't happen, Fidel.

398
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:43,388
Basilio cannot join forces with Simoun.

399
00:33:44,455 --> 00:33:48,126
Because Simoun will just
poison his mind even more.

400
00:33:50,828 --> 00:33:52,430
What if…

401
00:33:52,497 --> 00:33:54,165
he's on his way to Father Camorra?

402
00:33:57,802 --> 00:33:59,470
To kill the friar.

403
00:34:07,945 --> 00:34:10,581
What's going to happen
will be worse, Fidel.

404
00:34:11,983 --> 00:34:13,618
He will go straight to Simoun.

405
00:34:14,986 --> 00:34:21,025
They will ignite a revolution
driven by revenge and personal hatred.

406
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:24,762
And its climax…

407
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:31,335
will happen at an upcoming wedding.

408
00:34:49,053 --> 00:34:50,121
Isagani.

409
00:34:50,188 --> 00:34:51,022
Paulita.

410
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:54,225
Aren't the civil guards looking for you?

411
00:34:55,193 --> 00:34:57,328
You might get arrested
and imprisoned just like Basilio.

412
00:34:57,395 --> 00:34:58,463
You better go home.

413
00:34:59,197 --> 00:35:03,634
I just want to be with you
even for a short while, my life.

414
00:35:05,603 --> 00:35:07,572
These past few days
have been really tough.

415
00:35:08,973 --> 00:35:15,246
Perhaps the coming days
will be tougher, Isagani.

416
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:18,616
What do you mean, Paulita?

417
00:35:19,984 --> 00:35:22,453
I must obey my aunt.

418
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:25,456
We will be going home to Manila.

419
00:35:27,658 --> 00:35:29,594
She wants to marry me off to someone else.

420
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,402
Will you obey your aunt?

421
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:42,140
Even if it will destroy us?

422
00:35:43,441 --> 00:35:46,177
That is the life I must lead, Isagani.

423
00:35:47,211 --> 00:35:48,479
But, my life…

424
00:35:51,582 --> 00:35:54,018
I don't want to become like other women.

425
00:35:55,219 --> 00:35:58,656
I don't want to have the same fate
as the Maria Clara they are talking about.

426
00:36:04,128 --> 00:36:06,864
If only she had obeyed
her father and godfather,

427
00:36:07,431 --> 00:36:09,634
she would still be alive today.

428
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:11,102
She would already have kids by now,

429
00:36:12,904 --> 00:36:15,406
living peacefully in San Diego.

430
00:36:15,473 --> 00:36:18,509
That is the life that I want, Isagani.

431
00:36:18,576 --> 00:36:22,180
That has been my dream since I was little.

432
00:36:23,948 --> 00:36:27,885
A life without any trouble
and a peaceful one.

433
00:36:30,655 --> 00:36:32,957
And filled with blinding luxury?

434
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:36,494
But with the life that you are leading,

435
00:36:37,828 --> 00:36:39,830
I will never have those.

436
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:46,237
Goodbye and forgive me…

437
00:36:47,572 --> 00:36:48,472
my life.

438
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:19,503
I did not forget anything.

439
00:37:20,705 --> 00:37:25,343
Everything you need
and asked of me to keep is there.

440
00:37:25,843 --> 00:37:28,012
Thank you, Quiroga.

441
00:37:30,514 --> 00:37:33,050
You are truly dependable.

442
00:37:34,552 --> 00:37:36,520
But of course.

443
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:05,816
It is happening, Fidel.

444
00:38:09,754 --> 00:38:13,624
The events in the novel
are slowly unfolding.

445
00:38:17,194 --> 00:38:18,329
I am getting frustrated

446
00:38:18,396 --> 00:38:20,865
because no matter how much
I maneuver or stop anything,

447
00:38:20,931 --> 00:38:23,100
I still cannot change it!

448
00:38:32,677 --> 00:38:34,378
Basilio…

449
00:38:37,581 --> 00:38:38,949
You found me.

450
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:58,502
It was a huge mistake, señor.

451
00:39:01,439 --> 00:39:02,973
I thought…

452
00:39:04,308 --> 00:39:06,944
the love between me and Juli is enough…

453
00:39:08,979 --> 00:39:15,386
for me to overcome
the conquerors' contempt and murder

454
00:39:15,453 --> 00:39:17,188
of my mother and brother.

455
00:39:25,229 --> 00:39:27,531
But even she…

456
00:39:28,532 --> 00:39:30,468
even Juli…

457
00:39:33,237 --> 00:39:35,706
They raped her!

458
00:39:44,815 --> 00:39:47,385
I have made my decision, señor.

459
00:39:48,619 --> 00:39:49,754
You're right.

460
00:39:52,456 --> 00:39:55,292
It is time to get revenge.

461
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:57,895
Evil for evil!

462
00:39:59,497 --> 00:40:02,400
Violence for violence!

463
00:40:05,002 --> 00:40:06,370
I will help you.

464
00:40:09,774 --> 00:40:11,709
What is your plan, señor?

465
00:40:36,801 --> 00:40:40,971
Let's do everything we can to save
and bring Crisostomo Ibarra back.

466
00:40:41,038 --> 00:40:44,175
<i>I'm very fortunate to have come home
and found you here.</i>

467
00:40:44,241 --> 00:40:47,945
Especially the friend
I want to be with in the revolution.

468
00:40:48,512 --> 00:40:50,181
<i>Simoun is controlling you.</i>

469
00:40:50,247 --> 00:40:53,517
Forgive me but whoever disobeys will die.

470
00:40:53,584 --> 00:40:56,554
Think very carefully before you help sir.

471
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:58,522
I have made my decision.

472
00:40:58,589 --> 00:41:04,295
<i>Everyone is unaware
that the lamp contains nitroglycerine.</i>

473
00:41:04,361 --> 00:41:07,431
I just want to see Paulita
for the last time.

474
00:41:07,498 --> 00:41:08,866
You cannot go inside.

475
00:41:08,933 --> 00:41:10,334
Isagani… Isagani!

476
00:41:10,401 --> 00:41:11,969
<i>That in that feast,</i>

477
00:41:12,036 --> 00:41:14,705
<i>they will explode and shatter to pieces.</i>

478
00:41:14,772 --> 00:41:16,407
Boom!

479
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:19,410
I cannot bear for us to be apart anymore.

480
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:21,579
-Klay…
<i>-Come with me.</i>

481
00:41:21,645 --> 00:41:23,914
Come home with me to my world, Fidel.

482
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:24,982
COMING UP…

483
00:41:33,724 --> 00:41:36,193
