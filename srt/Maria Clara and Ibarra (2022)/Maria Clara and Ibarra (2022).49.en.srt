1
00:00:31,331 --> 00:00:34,267
MARIA CLARA AND IBARRA

2
00:00:34,334 --> 00:00:37,604
THIS PROGRAM, WHICH IS ADAPTED
FROM THE NOVELS OF DR. JOSE P. RIZAL,

3
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:42,542
IS PRESENTED USING DRAMATIC ELEMENTS
TO CONNECT THE PRESENT AND THE PAST

4
00:00:42,609 --> 00:00:46,413
IN A SPECIAL REIMAGINING OF THE NATIONAL
LITERATURE FILIPINOS ARE PROUD OF.

5
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:50,683
Change is what I am after.
The revolution of this country.

6
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:54,020
<i>Is that what you think should happen</i>

7
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:57,123
<i>for our country's revolution to succeed?</i>

8
00:00:57,190 --> 00:01:01,928
I only encourage them to act and fight.

9
00:01:01,995 --> 00:01:05,832
What you want is terrorism
caused by the subjugators!

10
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:07,634
Innocent people will die!

11
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:09,736
<i>Then let there be death!</i>

12
00:01:09,803 --> 00:01:11,871
<i>Do not push through with your plan</i>

13
00:01:11,938 --> 00:01:13,573
<i>because the ending won't be good.</i>

14
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,141
It is written in the book!

15
00:01:19,345 --> 00:01:20,680
<i>The friar's body is missing.</i>

16
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:22,482
Where could Salvi's body be?

17
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:24,717
I saw this in the clothes
that Simoun had left.

18
00:01:24,784 --> 00:01:27,020
"Your days are numbered."

19
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:29,122
Is that what Simoun wants to tell us?

20
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:30,657
Is he scaring us?

21
00:01:30,723 --> 00:01:31,925
That's Father Salvi!

22
00:01:31,991 --> 00:01:33,026
Such disrespect!

23
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:35,295
Who did this? Speak up!

24
00:01:35,361 --> 00:01:36,963
<i>Captain General, there's a body!</i>

25
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:37,897
<i>It's Simoun!</i>

26
00:01:37,964 --> 00:01:41,034
"There will be huge chaos.

27
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:45,305
We will kill all the workers of the church

28
00:01:45,371 --> 00:01:47,273
<i>and leaders of the government."</i>

29
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:48,908
They will pay for this!

30
00:01:48,975 --> 00:01:50,076
<i>We need to be careful.</i>

31
00:01:50,143 --> 00:01:52,078
The civil guards are looking for us

32
00:01:52,145 --> 00:01:54,948
<i>because of the slander
committed by the Brown Cardinal.</i>

33
00:01:55,014 --> 00:01:56,015
<i>The man named Simoun.</i>

34
00:01:56,082 --> 00:01:59,486
<i>What about the hut
I asked you to find in Tiani?</i>

35
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:01,788
-Did you find it?
-Yes.

36
00:02:01,855 --> 00:02:04,457
<i>He has also been rescued and taken home.</i>

37
00:02:05,992 --> 00:02:09,729
<i>I was wondering what their basis was</i>

38
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:11,397
in choosing who between the two of you

39
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:14,400
<i>will they use as their messenger</i>

40
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:15,969
and which one will they kill.

41
00:02:16,035 --> 00:02:17,470
PREVIOUSLY…

42
00:02:22,242 --> 00:02:23,076
Father,

43
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:25,345
did you hear that?

44
00:02:25,912 --> 00:02:26,846
It seems that there's…

45
00:02:29,849 --> 00:02:31,651
a bird of prey or maybe a hawk?

46
00:02:37,857 --> 00:02:38,691
Father,

47
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:40,994
can you hear me?

48
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:44,831
I know that you recognize me as your son…

49
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:47,667
who has come back.

50
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,271
Father, I've come back.

51
00:02:55,642 --> 00:02:57,510
I hope that you can sympathize with me.

52
00:03:05,885 --> 00:03:09,789
I always read Juli's farewell letter.

53
00:03:11,658 --> 00:03:12,859
I don't even know…

54
00:03:14,294 --> 00:03:15,895
how I can get her back from the Sister.

55
00:03:17,297 --> 00:03:18,364
And I don't know

56
00:03:18,431 --> 00:03:20,900
how I can take back
all of our possessions either.

57
00:03:22,168 --> 00:03:23,970
Including the only family I have left.

58
00:03:30,777 --> 00:03:31,911
Father.

59
00:03:33,313 --> 00:03:34,280
Father.

60
00:03:40,286 --> 00:03:41,688
Because just like you,

61
00:03:43,456 --> 00:03:45,091
I seem to have lost my voice.

62
00:03:46,826 --> 00:03:48,361
I am now disabled too.

63
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:51,531
Father,

64
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:54,901
they took everything from me.

65
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:59,239
They took all that we had.

66
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:16,022
Who's there?

67
00:04:28,668 --> 00:04:31,671
Are you Telesforo Juan de Dios?

68
00:04:31,738 --> 00:04:33,373
Formerly known

69
00:04:34,374 --> 00:04:35,241
as cabeza?

70
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:37,377
Cabeza Tales?

71
00:04:50,223 --> 00:04:51,257
What's this?

72
00:04:53,993 --> 00:04:57,263
Me, Macaraig, and the rest
of our friends pooled our money.

73
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:01,467
It's not much, but you can add
that to the money you will use

74
00:05:01,534 --> 00:05:02,902
to get Juli back.

75
00:05:04,237 --> 00:05:05,638
Oh, no.

76
00:05:05,705 --> 00:05:07,473
You don't have to do this, Isagani.

77
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:09,208
-It's embarrassing.
-Take it, Basilio.

78
00:05:10,076 --> 00:05:12,512
What are friends for
if we won't help each other?

79
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:18,918
Thank you so much, my friend.

80
00:05:20,086 --> 00:05:21,621
This is a big help.

81
00:05:23,022 --> 00:05:27,527
Just don't thank Pelaez when you see him.

82
00:05:27,593 --> 00:05:29,095
That rich man is so stingy.

83
00:05:31,597 --> 00:05:35,001
I promise, my friend,
when I'm able to save money, I will--

84
00:05:35,068 --> 00:05:36,235
My friend.

85
00:05:36,769 --> 00:05:38,805
Don't worry about paying
us back, all right?

86
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:41,708
What's important
is that you get Juli back.

87
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:07,400
Why is the Brown Cardinal in my house?

88
00:06:08,301 --> 00:06:13,973
I came here to tell you
that in three days,

89
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:19,345
the corporation will take back
your land and your house.

90
00:06:24,317 --> 00:06:25,518
They are merciless.

91
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,355
Are they impoverished too?

92
00:06:30,356 --> 00:06:31,691
Why are they in such a hurry?

93
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:34,961
And why are you the one
bringing this news to me?

94
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:40,933
Because I am the one who will
buy the corporation.

95
00:06:41,634 --> 00:06:43,736
The one who will buy your land and home.

96
00:06:45,138 --> 00:06:46,372
So that

97
00:06:47,607 --> 00:06:49,208
I can give them back to you.

98
00:06:55,481 --> 00:06:58,217
Did I hear that right, señor?

99
00:06:59,285 --> 00:07:02,955
Are you going to pay
to return my property?

100
00:07:05,858 --> 00:07:08,628
That's true, Cabeza Tales.

101
00:07:10,129 --> 00:07:11,030
But

102
00:07:11,631 --> 00:07:14,467
kindness should always be acknowledged.

103
00:07:16,035 --> 00:07:19,505
And all good deeds are reciprocated.

104
00:07:21,841 --> 00:07:23,309
I think that

105
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:28,614
you can be a big help
to the change that I want to happen.

106
00:07:33,052 --> 00:07:37,523
Can I expect your cooperation
with my plans, Cabeza Tales?

107
00:07:39,225 --> 00:07:41,461
In exchange for you to stay--

108
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:15,528
Why do you have this?

109
00:08:22,134 --> 00:08:24,670
Why do you have Maria Clara's locket?

110
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:37,817
How did you get this?

111
00:08:39,785 --> 00:08:40,953
That's my daughter's. Juli.

112
00:08:41,954 --> 00:08:44,857
It was given by her beloved, Basilio.

113
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:47,527
How did this end up with him?

114
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:52,765
The leper that he treated gave it to him.

115
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:56,502
Señor, why do you seem--

116
00:08:56,569 --> 00:09:00,573
I will buy this for 500 pesos.

117
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:08,080
Señor.

118
00:09:08,848 --> 00:09:10,249
Thank you very much for your offer.

119
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:13,486
-But I cannot sell that to you.
-I will double the price!

120
00:09:15,454 --> 00:09:17,323
Just let me know how much.

121
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:20,560
Jewelry.

122
00:09:20,626 --> 00:09:22,161
Do you need jewelry?

123
00:09:23,996 --> 00:09:26,332
I will give you all that you want

124
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,902
in exchange for this locket.

125
00:09:42,148 --> 00:09:44,684
A letter came from Manila.

126
00:09:45,618 --> 00:09:46,485
Thank you.

127
00:09:50,122 --> 00:09:51,190
What does it say?

128
00:09:59,298 --> 00:10:01,067
It's about Señorita Maria Clara.

129
00:10:19,018 --> 00:10:21,253
So it came true even if
they tried to stop it!

130
00:10:22,722 --> 00:10:24,090
Oh, my God.

131
00:10:24,757 --> 00:10:26,392
Does this mean

132
00:10:27,093 --> 00:10:29,195
everything written in the book
will also come true?

133
00:10:32,765 --> 00:10:34,800
Basilio, open the book.

134
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:38,838
Maybe there's something written there
about what will happen to us!

135
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:49,382
The problem is,

136
00:10:49,448 --> 00:10:52,118
it seems like the words written
on it have disappeared.

137
00:10:57,523 --> 00:10:58,724
The mysterious book.

138
00:10:59,225 --> 00:11:00,626
It really is.

139
00:11:05,965 --> 00:11:07,433
What does that mean?

140
00:11:09,301 --> 00:11:11,637
Maybe, if an occurrence
had already happened,

141
00:11:12,438 --> 00:11:14,306
that's the time it will appear
in the book.

142
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,713
Señor,

143
00:11:21,647 --> 00:11:22,715
I cannot sell it.

144
00:11:23,816 --> 00:11:25,818
That locket is important to my daughter.

145
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:29,288
And my family is more important
than anything else.

146
00:11:36,562 --> 00:11:39,932
Maybe this will change your mind.

147
00:11:45,971 --> 00:11:49,175
This revolver has a long range.

148
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:56,549
It's sufficient for protection
against bandits.

149
00:11:57,883 --> 00:11:59,018
Or maybe…

150
00:12:01,087 --> 00:12:03,456
against abusive corporations.

151
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,870
All you need is alertness

152
00:12:19,205 --> 00:12:21,073
and a keen vision.

153
00:12:24,944 --> 00:12:28,080
To be able to see the things
that other people don't see.

154
00:12:29,682 --> 00:12:32,985
This revolver can take down anyone…

155
00:12:35,221 --> 00:12:38,591
who tries to oppose the person holding it.

156
00:14:10,716 --> 00:14:13,185
Godfather, stop giving me a hard time.

157
00:14:20,226 --> 00:14:21,427
<i>Maria!</i>

158
00:15:24,323 --> 00:15:27,359
Klay, are you heading to town later?

159
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:29,028
Fidel, please come with me, okay?

160
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:35,167
I need to see Basilio.

161
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:38,337
I need to get the book back from him.

162
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:41,974
Do you really think that

163
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:46,779
the book, <i>El Filibusterismo,</i>
will be able to help us?

164
00:15:47,646 --> 00:15:48,480
Yes.

165
00:15:49,415 --> 00:15:51,784
If we are going to follow
what happens in the book,

166
00:15:54,053 --> 00:15:55,587
will Sir Ibarra still push through

167
00:15:55,654 --> 00:15:57,656
with his unsuccessful plan
involving the cabeza?

168
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:04,430
I'm sorry if I'm talking to myself again.

169
00:16:15,374 --> 00:16:16,842
Klay, I'd like to know.

170
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:20,412
What will happen to me in the story?

171
00:16:22,614 --> 00:16:23,449
What?

172
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:30,022
Please tell Father Camorra
that we dropped by the church earlier.

173
00:16:31,924 --> 00:16:35,294
By the way, here are the sticky
rice snacks for all of you.

174
00:16:36,061 --> 00:16:39,365
Tell him that it was Juli
who prepared that, okay?

175
00:16:39,932 --> 00:16:40,833
Yes, señora.

176
00:16:46,638 --> 00:16:48,974
Señora, wouldn't it be better

177
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:52,978
if you were the one to teach me
how to pray instead of the friar?

178
00:16:53,645 --> 00:16:56,315
Don't you know
that you are very fortunate?

179
00:16:57,182 --> 00:17:03,122
The curate is always happy to see you
and teaches you the word of God.

180
00:17:03,889 --> 00:17:05,691
But the way he stares,

181
00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:08,227
and the way he touches me.

182
00:17:09,094 --> 00:17:10,796
Are you trying to say something?

183
00:17:11,597 --> 00:17:15,267
There are rumors about
how he treats women, señora.

184
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:18,504
That's just gossip.

185
00:17:19,004 --> 00:17:23,175
You should only listen to me
and the disciples of God.

186
00:17:24,009 --> 00:17:26,011
Hello, Sister!

187
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:27,880
Hello, Sister Penchang!

188
00:17:27,946 --> 00:17:30,516
Did you hear about
the commotion in Manila?

189
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:34,153
Yes, I heard there was a gunfight
at the Monastery.

190
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:37,523
And that's where Maria Clara
de los Santos was killed.

191
00:17:37,589 --> 00:17:42,361
Oh, that is true.
That is also what I heard.

192
00:17:42,428 --> 00:17:44,797
Oh, the poor woman.

193
00:17:44,863 --> 00:17:47,766
She used to be the most beautiful woman

194
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:49,635
in San Diego.

195
00:17:50,469 --> 00:17:54,406
But her life was unfortunate.

196
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:59,878
If only she had made
the right priorities before,

197
00:17:59,945 --> 00:18:02,648
she could have been under my care now,

198
00:18:02,714 --> 00:18:07,553
and my nephew Linares
wouldn't have experienced misfortune.

199
00:18:08,487 --> 00:18:09,855
May they rest in peace.

200
00:18:10,856 --> 00:18:13,459
I thought we were going
to talk about something else

201
00:18:13,525 --> 00:18:15,527
other than you, my friend.

202
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:19,631
I thought she would finally forget
that her husband left her.

203
00:18:19,698 --> 00:18:22,201
My husband did not leave me!

204
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:28,407
Perhaps the bandits took him.

205
00:18:28,474 --> 00:18:29,341
Yes.

206
00:18:29,408 --> 00:18:33,112
I heard they were attacked by the bandits.

207
00:18:33,178 --> 00:18:35,547
And that's where Maria Clara was shot.

208
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:38,984
But what I heard is that…

209
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:43,589
she was raped by a priest.

210
00:18:44,156 --> 00:18:47,426
So she chose to kill herself.

211
00:18:48,026 --> 00:18:49,228
Goodness!

212
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:52,965
I am hearing different versions
of the story.

213
00:18:53,031 --> 00:18:54,867
I don't know what to believe anymore.

214
00:18:57,269 --> 00:18:58,837
<i>My dear Lord,</i>

215
00:18:58,904 --> 00:19:03,275
<i>please don't let me
or any women experience</i>

216
00:19:03,342 --> 00:19:05,043
<i>the tragedy that has happened
to Maria Clara.</i>

217
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:15,821
Elias and I took a peek
at the book the other night.

218
00:19:18,257 --> 00:19:22,094
Why does it seem like my name
wasn't written in it?

219
00:19:23,595 --> 00:19:25,831
We just skimmed over it, but…

220
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,735
I really didn't see my name.

221
00:19:34,306 --> 00:19:36,175
I was wondering about that too.

222
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:43,849
Does it mean that I'm just like Elias?

223
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:47,753
Who only appeared in the first book.

224
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,055
But you changed the story

225
00:19:50,722 --> 00:19:53,125
and that's why we are here now
in the second book.

226
00:19:59,598 --> 00:20:01,166
You weren't in the first book as well.

227
00:20:07,272 --> 00:20:08,607
I don't understand.

228
00:20:10,576 --> 00:20:11,610
If that's the case,

229
00:20:13,612 --> 00:20:14,513
who am I?

230
00:20:15,781 --> 00:20:18,984
What's my role?

231
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:21,753
I also don't know, Fidel.

232
00:20:22,854 --> 00:20:24,623
I tried hard to look
for the character "Fidel"

233
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:26,258
when I was reading <i>Noli.</i>

234
00:20:27,326 --> 00:20:29,595
I've tried using the find command
in the online version

235
00:20:29,661 --> 00:20:31,597
to look for "Fidel"
but I really couldn't find it.

236
00:20:35,968 --> 00:20:37,869
I also have many questions.

237
00:20:40,606 --> 00:20:41,673
The truth is,

238
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:44,109
I have some theories
about who you really are

239
00:20:44,176 --> 00:20:45,444
and where you came from,

240
00:20:46,378 --> 00:20:47,646
but I'm not sure.

241
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:52,117
-Would you like me to share them with you?
-Never mind.

242
00:20:55,654 --> 00:20:58,390
Perhaps we can talk about this
again some other time.

243
00:21:00,492 --> 00:21:05,464
It is better for you to address
the bad happenings in the book.

244
00:21:10,035 --> 00:21:10,936
All right.

245
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,875
In that case, let's join Elias
and the others

246
00:21:17,643 --> 00:21:20,045
so that we can prepare
for our descent to town.

247
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:24,983
You should probably go to Basilio.

248
00:21:26,685 --> 00:21:28,287
I will stay with the rest of the group.

249
00:22:16,401 --> 00:22:17,235
Fidel?

250
00:22:25,877 --> 00:22:27,045
Shouldn't you be

251
00:22:28,747 --> 00:22:29,981
heading to town now?

252
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:33,218
You weren't at the hideout.

253
00:22:34,086 --> 00:22:35,387
I looked for you there.

254
00:22:37,055 --> 00:22:38,590
I wanted to say goodbye.

255
00:22:38,657 --> 00:22:40,625
Are you really not coming with me?

256
00:22:41,326 --> 00:22:42,928
Why were you looking for me anyway?

257
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:46,365
Fidel, is there a problem?

258
00:22:48,934 --> 00:22:50,268
Do you have a problem with me?

259
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:55,240
Or do you have an issue with the book?

260
00:23:02,314 --> 00:23:05,617
Would you like me to show you
my theories about your character?

261
00:23:06,685 --> 00:23:07,686
I have a lot.

262
00:23:07,753 --> 00:23:09,588
I saved it on my phone.

263
00:23:09,654 --> 00:23:11,790
I'll turn it on even though
I'm conserving the battery.

264
00:23:16,128 --> 00:23:17,028
What is that?

265
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,114
My God!

266
00:23:39,184 --> 00:23:40,352
Who are they?

267
00:23:53,365 --> 00:23:54,366
Hawk Eye.

268
00:23:56,334 --> 00:23:57,569
Who is Hawk Eye?

269
00:23:59,638 --> 00:24:01,306
The story is really moving along.

270
00:24:03,508 --> 00:24:04,910
What has been written is happening.

271
00:24:07,412 --> 00:24:08,413
It means…

272
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:12,784
Basilio.

273
00:24:15,687 --> 00:24:16,955
You're right, Fidel.

274
00:24:17,022 --> 00:24:18,857
Go to Elias and tell him about this.

275
00:24:18,924 --> 00:24:21,026
I need to go to Basilio now.

276
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:23,462
Be careful.

277
00:24:23,528 --> 00:24:24,663
You too.

278
00:24:49,187 --> 00:24:53,258
My love, I am so worried after
learning about what happened to her.

279
00:24:55,393 --> 00:24:57,829
I am also worried about Captain Tiago.

280
00:24:58,897 --> 00:25:01,066
They will arrive tonight from Manila

281
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,336
to take Maria Clara's remains
back home with them.

282
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:07,005
Basilio, I'm scared.

283
00:25:08,106 --> 00:25:11,276
I'm scared that what happened
to Maria Clara will also happen to me.

284
00:25:12,277 --> 00:25:15,247
Especially since
I'm always inside the convent

285
00:25:15,313 --> 00:25:18,016
with Sister Penchang and Father Camorra.

286
00:25:18,083 --> 00:25:20,018
-Basilio, Father Camorra--
-My love.

287
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:21,887
Look at me.

288
00:25:23,088 --> 00:25:24,489
Breathe with me.

289
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:26,124
Deep breath.

290
00:25:31,129 --> 00:25:32,197
One more.

291
00:25:37,769 --> 00:25:38,603
My love,

292
00:25:41,406 --> 00:25:43,041
you don't have to worry.

293
00:25:47,412 --> 00:25:49,881
Because you don't need to stay
here anymore, my beloved.

294
00:25:51,883 --> 00:25:52,817
I'm here

295
00:25:53,818 --> 00:25:54,953
to take you home.

296
00:26:01,593 --> 00:26:03,128
But that can't be.

297
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:09,267
I still have a debt to pay
to Sister Penchang.

298
00:26:09,334 --> 00:26:11,136
She won't let me leave.

299
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:13,338
No, my love.

300
00:26:14,639 --> 00:26:17,075
I can finally pay them back
in exchange for your freedom.

301
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:21,313
My friends pooled their money

302
00:26:22,881 --> 00:26:24,182
so that I can take you back home.

303
00:26:29,688 --> 00:26:30,989
Don't you remember?

304
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:33,358
I told you.

305
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:37,896
I would find a way to bring you home.

306
00:26:39,698 --> 00:26:42,834
I am only fulfilling my promise to you.

307
00:26:50,408 --> 00:26:51,476
Oh, Basilio.

308
00:27:14,933 --> 00:27:16,067
Grandfather?

309
00:27:23,842 --> 00:27:25,543
Where is Father?

310
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:31,683
Is this from Father?

311
00:27:37,622 --> 00:27:38,823
<i>My beloved, Juli,</i>

312
00:27:39,791 --> 00:27:43,328
<i>if you're reading this now,</i>
<i>you're probably already back home.</i>

313
00:27:44,529 --> 00:27:46,164
<i>Forgive me for what I have done.</i>

314
00:27:46,931 --> 00:27:52,370
<i>I sold your necklace</i>
<i>in exchange for justice</i>

315
00:27:52,437 --> 00:27:54,906
<i>against our country's oppressors.</i>

316
00:27:55,874 --> 00:27:57,876
<i>Don't look for me right now.</i>

317
00:27:57,942 --> 00:27:59,978
<i>It would be better
if you didn't know my whereabouts.</i>

318
00:28:00,045 --> 00:28:02,080
<i>This is for your own safety.</i>

319
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:04,015
<i>Goodbye, my daughter.</i>

320
00:28:04,082 --> 00:28:05,116
<i>Tales.</i>

321
00:28:06,885 --> 00:28:07,919
Where is he?

322
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:10,388
Grandfather, what is he planning to do?

323
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:19,798
Grandfather?

324
00:28:20,465 --> 00:28:22,000
Is there something you want to tell us?

325
00:28:24,836 --> 00:28:28,006
<i>Why is the Brown Cardinal in my house?</i>

326
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:32,410
If only your grandfather could write.

327
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:37,215
I don't understand
what my grandfather is saying.

328
00:28:52,597 --> 00:28:53,798
I finally…

329
00:28:55,467 --> 00:28:57,001
met you.

330
00:29:00,872 --> 00:29:04,542
It is an honor to meet

331
00:29:04,609 --> 00:29:09,514
the famous friend of the Captain General,

332
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:14,619
Señor Simoun.

333
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:43,848
I'm surprised that Basilio
is not with you.

334
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:49,120
He has somewhere else to be.

335
00:29:51,389 --> 00:29:53,091
How are you, my life?

336
00:29:54,893 --> 00:29:57,362
I slipped out
while my auntie was sleeping,

337
00:29:57,896 --> 00:30:00,799
but I need to get back soon.

338
00:30:00,865 --> 00:30:01,866
Don't worry.

339
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:04,302
When we get married,

340
00:30:05,103 --> 00:30:06,938
we don't need to hide
our relationship anymore.

341
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:13,678
We will live in our province,
far away from here.

342
00:30:17,715 --> 00:30:20,151
Life there is simple and peaceful.

343
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:23,521
Is that what you really want, Isagani?

344
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:26,958
To live in a secluded place?

345
00:30:27,692 --> 00:30:31,529
Away from civilization and modernization?

346
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:36,601
I heard that they will build
a train there.

347
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:38,536
So, it will not be difficult for you

348
00:30:38,603 --> 00:30:40,438
to travel back here if you wish.

349
00:30:41,439 --> 00:30:42,707
But when will that be?

350
00:30:44,242 --> 00:30:46,277
When I'm old and trembling?

351
00:30:47,345 --> 00:30:48,880
When all my hair has turned gray?

352
00:30:51,082 --> 00:30:53,451
What matters
is that we're together, right?

353
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,555
That we'll be with each other forever?

354
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:05,530
Is there a problem, Paulita?

355
00:31:10,101 --> 00:31:12,203
<i>Maybe if an occurrence
had already happened,</i>

356
00:31:13,371 --> 00:31:15,139
that's the time
it will appear in the book.

357
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:16,474
That's impossible.

358
00:31:20,111 --> 00:31:23,047
I wonder if what happened between me
and Juli earlier will be in the book.

359
00:31:26,918 --> 00:31:27,785
Son?

360
00:31:29,854 --> 00:31:30,755
Doña Isabel.

361
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:34,225
You came home late, son.

362
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,128
You have arrived.

363
00:31:37,695 --> 00:31:38,596
We got here early.

364
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:41,866
You seem to be busy the whole day

365
00:31:41,933 --> 00:31:43,935
because you weren't able to welcome us.

366
00:31:47,171 --> 00:31:48,640
Oh, Sir Reynaldo.

367
00:31:48,706 --> 00:31:50,041
Good evening.

368
00:31:50,875 --> 00:31:52,610
Good thing you kept them company.

369
00:31:53,711 --> 00:31:55,680
For my beloved wife.

370
00:31:56,414 --> 00:32:00,385
I am willing to be here to comfort her.

371
00:32:03,388 --> 00:32:05,823
Ms. Etta didn't inform me of your arrival.

372
00:32:07,058 --> 00:32:08,259
Where is she right now?

373
00:32:09,494 --> 00:32:11,896
I'm sure she hasn't come home yet.

374
00:32:11,963 --> 00:32:16,901
I asked her to do plenty
of preparations for…

375
00:32:18,069 --> 00:32:19,804
Maria Clara's burial.

376
00:32:21,806 --> 00:32:22,674
Yes.

377
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:25,376
You are right, Father.

378
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:26,844
It is me.

379
00:32:28,146 --> 00:32:30,048
I am pleased to meet you…

380
00:32:31,049 --> 00:32:32,383
again.

381
00:32:39,257 --> 00:32:45,430
No one has visited me here
for a long time.

382
00:32:48,733 --> 00:32:51,703
I've been all alone
in this room for so long.

383
00:32:53,171 --> 00:32:58,343
I hope the news I am about to tell you
can ease your sadness.

384
00:33:00,611 --> 00:33:01,579
News?

385
00:33:03,915 --> 00:33:05,316
What news?

386
00:33:06,951 --> 00:33:08,753
She is gone, Father.

387
00:33:12,223 --> 00:33:15,727
Maria Clara is dead.

388
00:33:27,572 --> 00:33:28,673
Is there a problem, Paulita?

389
00:33:31,976 --> 00:33:34,712
I don't like the news that I am hearing.

390
00:33:35,646 --> 00:33:38,316
They have been arresting
people here and there.

391
00:33:40,051 --> 00:33:41,386
I am scared

392
00:33:41,986 --> 00:33:43,621
that you might get involved too.

393
00:33:46,257 --> 00:33:48,459
They have no reason to arrest me.

394
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:50,695
But I'm certain that they're
also keeping an eye on you

395
00:33:50,762 --> 00:33:53,197
because of your desire
to build an academy.

396
00:33:55,299 --> 00:33:57,268
Do you really need to be a part of that?

397
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:03,875
I just want our countrymen
to have a better life.

398
00:34:04,442 --> 00:34:06,577
So that they can learn
how to speak Spanish.

399
00:34:06,644 --> 00:34:09,747
Just like how the Spaniards
learned our language.

400
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:21,826
I promise, Paulita.

401
00:34:23,861 --> 00:34:25,329
Everything is going to be all right.

402
00:34:30,201 --> 00:34:31,035
Here.

403
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:33,271
I have a gift for you.

404
00:34:35,706 --> 00:34:39,510
So that even if we are not together,

405
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:41,479
you will always remember me.

406
00:34:57,929 --> 00:34:58,963
Forgive me.

407
00:35:00,131 --> 00:35:01,432
That was all I could afford.

408
00:35:02,867 --> 00:35:03,868
But I promise,

409
00:35:04,869 --> 00:35:06,971
as soon as I finish my law degree,

410
00:35:08,539 --> 00:35:11,075
I will buy you anything
that you want every day.

411
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,315
Will you really do that?

412
00:35:18,516 --> 00:35:21,686
Even if you only want a simple life?

413
00:35:30,895 --> 00:35:33,698
Life would be meaningless
without you, Paulita.

414
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,268
Whatever kind of life that is,

415
00:35:38,336 --> 00:35:39,804
the kind of life that you want,

416
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,608
that will be my peace.

417
00:35:51,015 --> 00:35:54,285
Don't make jokes like that.

418
00:36:04,462 --> 00:36:05,830
Who are you to…

419
00:36:06,797 --> 00:36:10,935
Who are you to come here
and give me such bad news?

420
00:36:14,805 --> 00:36:16,140
Do you really think

421
00:36:16,207 --> 00:36:18,576
that this kind of news
is something you can joke about?

422
00:36:21,112 --> 00:36:22,246
It is true

423
00:36:22,947 --> 00:36:25,950
that the lady has passed away.

424
00:36:27,885 --> 00:36:29,687
Who are you, really?

425
00:36:33,057 --> 00:36:34,325
Your daughter

426
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:38,029
is already dead.

427
00:36:49,807 --> 00:36:51,475
My condolences, Doña Isabel.

428
00:36:51,976 --> 00:36:53,277
The captain?

429
00:36:54,078 --> 00:36:55,146
How is he?

430
00:36:56,714 --> 00:36:58,316
He's disoriented.

431
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:00,918
We can't talk to him.

432
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:03,354
He doesn't even want to eat.

433
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:07,925
He immediately locked himself up
in his room when we arrived.

434
00:37:10,628 --> 00:37:11,729
Don't worry.

435
00:37:12,263 --> 00:37:14,398
I will check on him later.

436
00:37:14,465 --> 00:37:16,367
Maybe I can convince him to eat.

437
00:37:17,768 --> 00:37:22,707
He still can't believe
that his one and only daughter is gone.

438
00:37:24,842 --> 00:37:26,310
He has lost the will to live.

439
00:37:30,281 --> 00:37:33,951
It is really hard to accept
the death of a loved one.

440
00:37:35,286 --> 00:37:36,420
I went through the same thing

441
00:37:36,487 --> 00:37:38,189
when it happened to my mother
and my brother.

442
00:37:40,458 --> 00:37:41,892
It will destroy you

443
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:45,196
and you will feel utter sadness.

444
00:37:47,398 --> 00:37:48,966
Back then, I thought that…

445
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:52,670
I wouldn't be able to get up
on my feet again.

446
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:56,207
Señora.

447
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:57,541
The captain?

448
00:37:58,142 --> 00:38:01,512
I checked on him right away
and he is not moving.

449
00:38:01,579 --> 00:38:03,247
But his eyes are open.

450
00:38:03,314 --> 00:38:04,348
What?

451
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:19,964
Captain!

452
00:38:23,234 --> 00:38:24,068
Captain.

453
00:38:35,046 --> 00:38:36,180
What happened?

454
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:41,018
He had too much opium.

455
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:42,887
What?

456
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:55,266
Aren't you a doctor?

457
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:57,468
Do something!

458
00:38:57,535 --> 00:38:59,737
Revive him, help him!

459
00:39:07,678 --> 00:39:08,746
Captain?

460
00:39:34,972 --> 00:39:38,876
This can't be…

461
00:39:40,611 --> 00:39:42,947
Tiago!

462
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:50,054
Tiago! This cannot be…

463
00:39:51,255 --> 00:39:53,691
Don't leave me, Tiago!

464
00:40:02,266 --> 00:40:04,568
This cannot be…

465
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:13,110
Do you mean this, Father?

466
00:40:17,515 --> 00:40:18,482
Thank you.

467
00:40:24,622 --> 00:40:25,489
Thank you.

468
00:40:30,294 --> 00:40:31,328
Señor?

469
00:40:34,298 --> 00:40:35,299
Señor.

470
00:40:36,801 --> 00:40:38,502
What are you doing?

471
00:40:38,569 --> 00:40:42,106
I need water. My chest hurts.

472
00:40:42,173 --> 00:40:44,508
I must drink water.

473
00:40:44,575 --> 00:40:45,643
Señor, why?

474
00:40:51,782 --> 00:40:53,417
Who are you, really?

475
00:40:58,189 --> 00:41:03,861
This is the right time for you
to say goodbye

476
00:41:06,096 --> 00:41:09,066
and suffer in hell

477
00:41:10,267 --> 00:41:13,170
for all the sins you've committed.

478
00:41:16,207 --> 00:41:17,575
Against Maria Clara.

479
00:41:21,612 --> 00:41:25,015
Against her pitiful mother.

480
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:30,888
Against Captain Tiago.

481
00:41:36,694 --> 00:41:38,596
And especially…

482
00:41:45,302 --> 00:41:48,272
against my father.

483
00:42:00,084 --> 00:42:02,653
Crisostomo Ibarra?

484
00:42:05,656 --> 00:42:06,490
No.

485
00:42:07,725 --> 00:42:09,226
This can't be happening.

486
00:42:11,095 --> 00:42:13,030
Ibarra has long been dead.

487
00:42:14,398 --> 00:42:16,066
I really hope I have died

488
00:42:16,133 --> 00:42:17,935
so that I can be with Maria Clara now.

489
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:20,938
Maria Clara…

490
00:42:22,506 --> 00:42:25,643
died from extreme anguish!

491
00:42:28,312 --> 00:42:29,380
Maria…

492
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:35,653
died because of your cruelty
and Father Salvi's.

493
00:42:47,631 --> 00:42:48,499
Melchor!

494
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:51,201
Melchor.

495
00:43:15,993 --> 00:43:16,894
Señor!

496
00:43:16,961 --> 00:43:19,129
What is happening to Father Damaso?

497
00:43:19,196 --> 00:43:21,565
Help me. Help me.

498
00:43:22,166 --> 00:43:23,834
Father is having a heart attack.

499
00:43:24,935 --> 00:43:26,804
Go get help, hurry!

500
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:32,943
I can't breathe.

501
00:43:34,812 --> 00:43:35,913
You…

502
00:43:36,914 --> 00:43:39,583
are the root of all of this, Father.

503
00:43:41,752 --> 00:43:47,324
That is why the fruition
of my plans comes back to you.

504
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:56,867
I am blessing you
with endless suffering in hell!

505
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:01,505
Until we meet again.

506
00:44:03,407 --> 00:44:06,110
The son of the devil

507
00:44:07,878 --> 00:44:10,581
has run out of love.

508
00:45:09,206 --> 00:45:11,909
If it hasn't happened yet,
can it be prevented?

509
00:45:11,975 --> 00:45:13,143
It can still be changed.

510
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:16,346
And what I read before might never happen.

511
00:45:16,413 --> 00:45:18,615
His mind can still change.

512
00:45:18,682 --> 00:45:20,551
Or perhaps he has a new plan.

513
00:45:20,617 --> 00:45:22,186
COMING UP…

514
00:45:22,252 --> 00:45:24,788
<i>"It was a poison that ended our lives.</i>

515
00:45:24,855 --> 00:45:26,824
<i>Poison brought about
by the Philippine Islands.</i>

516
00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:28,625
<i>With love, S."</i>

517
00:45:28,692 --> 00:45:31,161
No, Basilio, don't listen to him.

518
00:45:31,228 --> 00:45:33,097
<i>No matter what happens. Do you understand?</i>

519
00:45:33,163 --> 00:45:36,667
What's important is that
our loved ones are with us.

520
00:45:36,734 --> 00:45:38,969
-The civil guards are here!
-You are under arrest.

521
00:45:39,036 --> 00:45:41,205
<i>Why are you arresting me?
I didn't do anything wrong!</i>

522
00:45:48,746 --> 00:45:51,215
