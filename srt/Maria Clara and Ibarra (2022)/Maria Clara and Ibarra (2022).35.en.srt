00:00:28,395 --> 00:00:31,564
MARIA CLARA AND IBARRA

2
00:00:31,631 --> 00:00:35,568
THIS PROGRAM, WHICH IS ADAPTED
FROM THE NOVELS OF DR. JOSE P. RIZAL,

3
00:00:35,635 --> 00:00:40,573
IS PRESENTED USING DRAMATIC ELEMENTS
TO CONNECT THE PRESENT AND THE PAST

4
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:46,379
IN A SPECIAL REIMAGINING OF THE NATIONAL
LITERATURE FILIPINOS ARE PROUD OF.

5
00:00:46,446 --> 00:00:48,281
<i>Saint Bartholomew!</i>

6
00:00:48,348 --> 00:00:49,449
Omen of death!

7
00:00:50,817 --> 00:00:52,652
<i>Why are you surprised?</i>

8
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:56,423
There are so many vultures in our town.

9
00:00:56,489 --> 00:00:58,425
<i>See, Señor General?</i>

10
00:00:58,491 --> 00:01:00,326
<i>Ibarra is a traitor.</i>

11
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:03,329
I can't believe that Señor Ibarra
is capable of doing this.

12
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:04,864
You still don't believe it?

13
00:01:04,931 --> 00:01:08,201
<i>Good thing I also have another letter</i>

14
00:01:08,268 --> 00:01:09,602
<i>that came from Maria Clara.</i>

15
00:01:09,669 --> 00:01:11,404
<i>Compare the two.</i>

16
00:01:11,471 --> 00:01:14,107
<i>It has the same handwriting, doesn't it?</i>

17
00:01:14,174 --> 00:01:17,710
That is why I am sure that
Crisostomo Ibarra is the one

18
00:01:17,777 --> 00:01:18,978
who wrote that letter.

19
00:01:19,045 --> 00:01:20,880
<i>Then let's see. I'll make sure they fail!</i>

20
00:01:20,947 --> 00:01:23,116
<i>What is the vulture clawing on?</i>

21
00:01:23,183 --> 00:01:24,284
<i>Merciful God!</i>

22
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:26,019
<i>It's the corpse of a child.</i>

23
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:27,787
<i>Run, Tala.</i>

24
00:01:27,854 --> 00:01:29,622
<i>And go to the house of the Ibarra's.</i>

25
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:32,025
<i>I can feel my son.</i>

26
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:33,793
<i>Crispin is here.</i>

27
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:34,928
<i>Did you see the face?</i>

28
00:01:34,994 --> 00:01:36,096
<i>Whose body is it?</i>

29
00:01:36,162 --> 00:01:37,764
The face and body are already decaying.

30
00:01:37,831 --> 00:01:38,998
<i>This is indeed Crispin.</i>

31
00:01:39,566 --> 00:01:41,835
<i>The sacristan is already dead.</i>

32
00:01:41,901 --> 00:01:43,837
<i>Keep her away…</i>

33
00:01:43,903 --> 00:01:45,705
I want to embrace my son!

34
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:46,773
That's enough!

35
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:49,442
Let go of me!

36
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:53,446
My son…

37
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:57,484
I came here to do my duty, sir.

38
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:58,818
Has my order been executed?

39
00:01:58,885 --> 00:02:00,987
-Yes, sir.
-Now we will see if Sir Ibarra

40
00:02:01,054 --> 00:02:05,258
succeeds with his planned rebellion.

41
00:02:05,325 --> 00:02:06,459
<i>Elias was right.</i>

42
00:02:06,526 --> 00:02:09,829
<i>They will oppress and kill
whoever they want.</i>

43
00:02:09,896 --> 00:02:11,831
<i>I want to retaliate!</i>

44
00:02:11,898 --> 00:02:14,467
But I can't do so!

45
00:02:14,534 --> 00:02:16,769
I'm not sure if I can handle this anymore!

46
00:02:16,836 --> 00:02:18,771
<i>You must restrain yourself even more!</i>

47
00:02:18,838 --> 00:02:20,206
<i>Coming from you?</i>

48
00:02:20,273 --> 00:02:24,043
How come your attitude has changed?

49
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:25,845
Because I don't want you to be in danger.

50
00:02:25,912 --> 00:02:27,580
<i>I don't want you to die!</i>

51
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:29,616
<i>We need to be careful.</i>

52
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:42,762
Father, your sermon was very insightful

53
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:45,665
and I learned so much.

54
00:02:45,732 --> 00:02:47,300
Good, good.

55
00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:50,303
I'm glad that you've learned a lot.

56
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:55,341
Where is Father Damaso?

57
00:02:55,408 --> 00:03:01,147
We want to ask him if he already
went back to see Maria Clara.

58
00:03:01,214 --> 00:03:03,416
Father, would you know if the young lady

59
00:03:03,483 --> 00:03:07,287
has already agreed to marry our Alfonso?

60
00:03:08,755 --> 00:03:10,790
She is not marrying anyone.

61
00:03:12,225 --> 00:03:14,694
What did the friar say?

62
00:03:14,761 --> 00:03:21,167
I don't know either
because he spoke in Latin.

63
00:03:21,234 --> 00:03:23,636
What I'm trying to say is that

64
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:25,905
you may go now.

65
00:03:25,972 --> 00:03:29,375
I need to rest because I'm already tired.

66
00:03:29,442 --> 00:03:30,710
Understood?

67
00:03:30,777 --> 00:03:32,178
Understood, Father.

68
00:03:32,245 --> 00:03:33,413
Goodbye.

69
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:34,347
Thank you.

70
00:03:35,915 --> 00:03:37,417
Father Salvi…

71
00:03:37,483 --> 00:03:39,919
I have bad news.

72
00:03:39,986 --> 00:03:41,654
What is it?

73
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:43,489
The missing sacristan has been found

74
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:45,558
but Crispin is already dead.

75
00:03:46,626 --> 00:03:50,563
We saw the rotting corpse
of the child in the woods.

76
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:53,466
Mother of God!

77
00:03:53,533 --> 00:03:55,401
How did the child die, sir?

78
00:03:55,969 --> 00:04:02,308
Or maybe the right question is…

79
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:04,077
who killed the sacristan?

80
00:04:17,357 --> 00:04:20,360
Poor mother.

81
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:22,895
She has completely lost her mind.

82
00:04:24,831 --> 00:04:26,966
Where is the corpse of the child?

83
00:04:27,033 --> 00:04:30,103
The child's body is with
the gravedigger now.

84
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:33,373
Sisa didn't want to let go of the body

85
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:34,974
even though it was rotting and smelly.

86
00:04:37,877 --> 00:04:41,214
That is why we came here,
your honorable General,

87
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:45,285
to ask for an investigation
into the child's murder.

88
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:47,487
Murder?

89
00:04:49,222 --> 00:04:52,492
What makes you so sure
that he was murdered?

90
00:04:52,558 --> 00:04:55,595
Is it not murder if the body
was intentionally buried?

91
00:04:58,698 --> 00:05:01,968
To conceal the crime committed?

92
00:05:03,703 --> 00:05:05,805
We need your help, General…

93
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:07,907
my friend.

94
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:12,612
Give justice to the poor mother
and her dead child.

95
00:05:14,213 --> 00:05:17,550
Because Señor Crisostomo Ibarra
is the mastermind

96
00:05:17,617 --> 00:05:19,886
of the rebellion that will happen tonight.

97
00:05:21,921 --> 00:05:22,989
My friend?

98
00:05:25,725 --> 00:05:27,527
Are we really friends, señor?

99
00:05:38,705 --> 00:05:41,274
Of course, we are good friends.

100
00:05:45,111 --> 00:05:48,281
Don't worry, I will have this
investigated immediately,

101
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:49,282
my friend.

102
00:05:51,284 --> 00:05:52,652
Thank you so much, señor.

103
00:06:03,096 --> 00:06:06,165
<i>Mother!</i>

104
00:06:06,232 --> 00:06:07,300
<i>My mother…</i>

105
00:06:12,238 --> 00:06:14,841
Basilio?

106
00:06:14,907 --> 00:06:16,542
I can hear my sons.

107
00:06:16,609 --> 00:06:18,244
Crispin?

108
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:19,312
<i>My mother…</i>

109
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,347
Basilio…

110
00:06:21,414 --> 00:06:23,850
<i>Mother!</i>

111
00:06:28,921 --> 00:06:30,957
-Miss Sisa!
-Ma'am Sisa!

112
00:06:37,296 --> 00:06:38,564
My friend…

113
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:44,904
My friend, you traitor!

114
00:07:29,048 --> 00:07:30,583
Are there any updates?

115
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:32,385
I already spoke with Sir Ibarra.

116
00:07:33,886 --> 00:07:36,689
Our leader has given the signal.

117
00:07:36,756 --> 00:07:39,158
We will attack the headquarters later.

118
00:07:39,225 --> 00:07:40,860
So, let's go and discuss this.

119
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:09,622
She's finally asleep.

120
00:08:14,227 --> 00:08:15,294
That's good.

121
00:08:16,896 --> 00:08:19,665
Tomorrow morning, I will
ask one of my employees

122
00:08:21,634 --> 00:08:28,107
to get someone from the
hospice to come here

123
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:29,075
and fetch Miss Sisa.

124
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:32,378
Wait.

125
00:08:32,445 --> 00:08:33,779
What about Crispin's body?

126
00:08:34,814 --> 00:08:38,818
Can't Miss Sisa bid her child
farewell and see him be buried?

127
00:08:40,653 --> 00:08:46,392
I will ask the gravedigger to accompany
Miss Sisa in burying Crispin…

128
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:51,097
before I take her back to the hospital.

129
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:23,195
Why is he so cold?

130
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:34,607
Ali?

131
00:09:41,814 --> 00:09:42,982
Ali, is that you?

132
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:47,587
It's been a while.

133
00:09:54,293 --> 00:09:56,362
You're with your family.

134
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:57,597
What's up?

135
00:10:00,533 --> 00:10:01,934
I remember back then…

136
00:10:02,001 --> 00:10:04,103
you show up whenever I'm sad.

137
00:10:09,675 --> 00:10:10,843
Or whenever--

138
00:10:18,551 --> 00:10:21,988
<i>It was only Basilio who came</i>
<i>home last night from the church.</i>

139
00:10:22,054 --> 00:10:26,959
<i>Crispin was left in the hands</i>
<i>of the senior sacristan and curate.</i>

140
00:10:27,026 --> 00:10:28,494
He hasn't come home yet.

141
00:10:37,069 --> 00:10:38,904
Something bad is going to happen?

142
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:57,423
What…

143
00:11:00,292 --> 00:11:02,028
Elias.

144
00:11:02,094 --> 00:11:04,230
How did you get in here?

145
00:11:04,296 --> 00:11:06,532
Señor, you need to escape right away

146
00:11:07,099 --> 00:11:08,034
because any moment now,

147
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:12,438
the civil guards will be
arriving to arrest you!

148
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:14,573
For what reason?

149
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:18,244
For being the leader
of the upcoming revolt.

150
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:19,578
What nonsense is this?

151
00:11:43,436 --> 00:11:45,538
Put your hands up and surrender!

152
00:11:46,472 --> 00:11:47,540
Drop your weapons!

153
00:11:52,611 --> 00:11:53,546
Fire!

154
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:07,093
Sir Ibarra!

155
00:12:08,794 --> 00:12:11,030
They already started to attack
the headquarters!

156
00:12:11,997 --> 00:12:13,299
Señor…

157
00:12:13,365 --> 00:12:15,434
the civil guards
will arrive at any moment.

158
00:12:15,501 --> 00:12:18,237
But I have nothing to do with that revolt!

159
00:12:18,304 --> 00:12:19,605
I know.

160
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:21,574
They just made this up

161
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,743
so that they can imprison and destroy you!

162
00:12:25,544 --> 00:12:27,213
What madness is this?

163
00:12:30,316 --> 00:12:32,351
Sir.

164
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:34,019
Elias?

165
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:36,155
What's happening?
I heard something. Was it--

166
00:12:36,222 --> 00:12:37,056
Was it a gunshot?

167
00:12:37,123 --> 00:12:38,624
Miss Klay…

168
00:12:38,691 --> 00:12:41,527
There is no time to explain.

169
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:43,996
Let us start burning documents and papers

170
00:12:44,063 --> 00:12:46,699
that the civil guards can
possibly use against Ibarra!

171
00:12:47,299 --> 00:12:48,868
Especially all the important things.

172
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:50,035
Do it now. Let's throw them!

173
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:51,971
Oh, okay, okay.

174
00:12:54,807 --> 00:12:55,975
Here, Miss Klay.

175
00:13:30,376 --> 00:13:36,048
Do you know the person whose name
and signature are written here,

176
00:13:36,115 --> 00:13:37,316
Señor Ibarra?

177
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,961
He's my father's grandfather.

178
00:13:51,597 --> 00:13:56,302
My grandfather's son decided
to make his family name shorter.

179
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:00,472
That's why the surname Eibarramendia

180
00:14:00,539 --> 00:14:01,540
became Ibarra.

181
00:14:07,746 --> 00:14:09,415
Wait, Elias! Stop!

182
00:14:09,481 --> 00:14:10,516
What happened?

183
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:15,287
<i>It was Don Pedro who ruined
the honor of my ancestor.</i>

184
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,429
<i>He's the reason why
my whole family suffered</i>

185
00:14:23,495 --> 00:14:25,698
and was destroyed!

186
00:14:26,265 --> 00:14:27,366
All of you.

187
00:14:27,433 --> 00:14:29,335
The Ibarras.

188
00:14:29,401 --> 00:14:33,005
You were the ones who
brought me misfortune!

189
00:14:42,748 --> 00:14:46,252
I ask forgiveness for whatever it is

190
00:14:46,318 --> 00:14:48,153
that my great-grandfather
did to your family.

191
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,456
Your wealth is as much

192
00:14:50,522 --> 00:14:53,259
as our misfortune.

193
00:14:53,325 --> 00:14:54,860
You grew up living a good life,

194
00:14:54,927 --> 00:14:59,064
while my family died in
poverty and misery!

195
00:14:59,131 --> 00:15:00,633
Elias.

196
00:15:00,699 --> 00:15:03,802
If you really believe…

197
00:15:03,869 --> 00:15:07,172
that what my ancestors did to
your family is also my fault…

198
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:10,709
Okay, then! Take my life!

199
00:15:10,776 --> 00:15:11,777
Wait, wait, wait!

200
00:15:11,844 --> 00:15:14,380
Elias, wait!

201
00:15:14,446 --> 00:15:16,382
Look at me.

202
00:15:16,448 --> 00:15:17,549
Do you still remember?

203
00:15:17,616 --> 00:15:20,019
Sir Ibarra saved your life
back then, right?

204
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:22,721
You made a promise to him.
You owe him your life, right?

205
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:28,193
<i>I just want to thank you.</i>

206
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,762
<i>For saving my life.</i>

207
00:15:29,828 --> 00:15:31,430
<i>Rest assured…</i>

208
00:15:31,497 --> 00:15:33,899
that I will repay you
for what you have done

209
00:15:33,966 --> 00:15:35,367
when the right time comes.

210
00:15:39,471 --> 00:15:41,573
You must escape now,

211
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,942
while there's still time.

212
00:15:45,144 --> 00:15:48,180
But remember this, Crisostomo Ibarra.

213
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:52,351
You are now all alone in your aspirations.

214
00:15:52,418 --> 00:15:54,720
Do not expect any help from me!

215
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:13,739
My God.

216
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:16,008
What's happening?

217
00:16:16,075 --> 00:16:17,009
Sir, why--

218
00:16:17,076 --> 00:16:17,977
why is this happening?

219
00:16:18,043 --> 00:16:19,445
How did you get into this situation?

220
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,181
Is that a gun?

221
00:16:22,748 --> 00:16:24,083
There's a gun in there?

222
00:16:25,384 --> 00:16:26,986
What are you going to do with that?

223
00:16:29,421 --> 00:16:30,689
Crisostomo Ibarra.

224
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:33,058
Miss Klay.

225
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:35,394
Listen.

226
00:16:37,229 --> 00:16:40,432
Take Miss Sisa with you and go to Fidel.

227
00:16:41,633 --> 00:16:44,536
Tell him about everything
that just happened.

228
00:16:44,603 --> 00:16:46,005
But wait. What about you?

229
00:16:46,071 --> 00:16:47,039
Are you going to escape?

230
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:51,577
Miss Klay, I don't need to escape

231
00:16:51,643 --> 00:16:53,278
because I am not yet a criminal.

232
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:55,247
So you better do as I say

233
00:16:57,082 --> 00:16:58,317
and be careful.

234
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:14,733
This is crazy!

235
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:15,934
My God!

236
00:17:16,001 --> 00:17:20,205
Jose Rizal, Mister Torres,
I leave our fates to you.

237
00:17:20,272 --> 00:17:22,274
Please take care of Sir Ibarra.

238
00:17:41,693 --> 00:17:43,429
Animals!

239
00:17:43,495 --> 00:17:45,631
Eibarramendias!

240
00:17:45,697 --> 00:17:47,666
Why did you play with me and Ibarra?

241
00:17:49,334 --> 00:17:50,602
Why?

242
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:13,959
Mister Adong?

243
00:18:14,026 --> 00:18:16,028
Have you seen Miss Sisa?

244
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:17,296
Isn't she in the room?

245
00:18:17,362 --> 00:18:19,298
I checked, but she wasn't there.

246
00:18:19,364 --> 00:18:20,432
Huh?

247
00:18:20,499 --> 00:18:21,934
Can you check at the front house?

248
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:22,968
All right, Miss.

249
00:19:09,715 --> 00:19:11,183
I'll be doomed!

250
00:19:12,618 --> 00:19:13,719
Where is it?

251
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:16,655
Where is it?

252
00:20:19,685 --> 00:20:22,721
<i>Son, just stay here.</i>
<i>Don't leave mother, okay?</i>

253
00:20:22,788 --> 00:20:24,256
<i>No matter what happens,</i>

254
00:20:24,323 --> 00:20:26,425
<i>we will all be together</i>
<i>with your brother, Crispin</i>

255
00:20:26,491 --> 00:20:28,927
<i>and we will go home to our hut, okay?</i>

256
00:20:28,994 --> 00:20:30,295
<i>Yes, Mother.</i>

257
00:21:11,637 --> 00:21:14,740
<i>Sir Crisostomo, the civil guards are here!</i>

258
00:21:37,195 --> 00:21:39,031
Sir, I couldn't stop them.

259
00:21:46,838 --> 00:21:48,507
What are you doing here?

260
00:21:48,573 --> 00:21:51,209
In the name of the King and
by the order of the General,

261
00:21:51,276 --> 00:21:53,979
you are under arrest,
Señor Crisostomo Ibarra.

262
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:56,982
For what reason?

263
00:21:57,683 --> 00:22:01,687
Señor Ibarra, you are under arrest
for the crime of subversion

264
00:22:02,888 --> 00:22:04,856
and for inciting a revolution.

265
00:22:14,766 --> 00:22:16,668
Put down your weapons.

266
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:20,806
I wish to prove to you
that your accusations

267
00:22:20,872 --> 00:22:22,441
against me are not true!

268
00:22:23,709 --> 00:22:27,379
Señor, with all due respect,
please don't go with them.

269
00:22:29,781 --> 00:22:30,916
Let everyone here see

270
00:22:31,783 --> 00:22:34,286
that I will go with you
willingly and peacefully,

271
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:37,723
and that I have committed no crime.

272
00:22:38,824 --> 00:22:42,594
Señor, that is also what
happened to your father.

273
00:22:42,661 --> 00:22:43,829
He willingly surrendered

274
00:22:43,895 --> 00:22:46,398
because he knew that he was not at fault.

275
00:22:46,465 --> 00:22:48,734
And you know what happened
to him in the end.

276
00:22:52,904 --> 00:22:53,739
Señor,

277
00:22:55,741 --> 00:22:58,543
if you can promise that you
will come with us peacefully

278
00:22:58,610 --> 00:23:00,212
and that you won't try to escape,

279
00:23:01,446 --> 00:23:03,181
we will not tie your hands.

280
00:23:14,292 --> 00:23:15,527
Let us go then.

281
00:23:17,496 --> 00:23:19,765
Escort him! Go now!

282
00:23:47,626 --> 00:23:49,060
Oh, Clarita,

283
00:23:51,229 --> 00:23:52,531
you're already up.

284
00:23:53,064 --> 00:23:57,102
You should get dressed now.

285
00:23:57,169 --> 00:24:00,338
The four o'clock mass is about to start.

286
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:05,911
Auntie, did you also hear the gunshots?

287
00:24:05,977 --> 00:24:07,646
Or maybe I was just dreaming?

288
00:24:09,347 --> 00:24:12,751
So, you also heard the gunshots.

289
00:24:12,818 --> 00:24:15,520
Don't worry about it, Clarita.

290
00:24:15,587 --> 00:24:18,457
Maybe they just arrested some bandits

291
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:21,560
or maybe some drunk civil guards

292
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:24,129
were just playing around
with their weapons.

293
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:28,533
Don't worry.

294
00:24:29,534 --> 00:24:32,304
We will ask around the church.

295
00:24:32,871 --> 00:24:37,075
I believe there is nothing
for you to worry about.

296
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:38,577
And if there is,

297
00:24:39,377 --> 00:24:41,580
let's just include it in our prayers

298
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:44,549
and hope that Crisostomo is all right.

299
00:24:46,585 --> 00:24:49,054
Well then, go ahead and dress up.

300
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:53,058
After the mass,
we will go to the seamstress

301
00:24:53,124 --> 00:24:55,527
so she can get your measurements
for your wedding dress.

302
00:25:16,248 --> 00:25:19,818
Take this to the store
because we get more sales

303
00:25:19,885 --> 00:25:21,586
during Christmas and evening mass.

304
00:25:29,895 --> 00:25:30,795
Sir Fidel!

305
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:34,065
Miss Klay.

306
00:25:35,233 --> 00:25:37,369
You seem to be taking advantage
of the dawn mass

307
00:25:37,435 --> 00:25:39,504
to pay me a visit at this hour.

308
00:25:40,005 --> 00:25:44,276
Sir Fidel, many things
have happened and I need your help.

309
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:48,113
But why are you here alone?

310
00:25:51,182 --> 00:25:53,051
Miss Sisa is missing.

311
00:25:53,618 --> 00:25:57,088
And Sir Ibarra was arrested
by the civil guards and the General.

312
00:25:58,189 --> 00:25:59,190
The General?

313
00:26:00,959 --> 00:26:02,327
That's impossible, Miss Klay.

314
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:05,564
And before that, Elias
and Sir Ibarra had a fight.

315
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:07,766
My gosh, Sir Fidel,
so many events happened!

316
00:26:07,832 --> 00:26:10,802
I don't know where to start to fix this!

317
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:14,039
Well then, let's go to
the headquarters now

318
00:26:14,105 --> 00:26:16,508
to find out how Crisostomo is doing now.

319
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:18,143
Headquarters? Yes. All right, okay.

320
00:26:18,209 --> 00:26:19,210
Come on.

321
00:26:44,569 --> 00:26:45,804
<i>They are keeping me away</i>

322
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:47,806
<i>from the people and things</i>
<i>that matter to me.</i>

323
00:26:48,873 --> 00:26:49,774
<i>My father…</i>

324
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:52,644
<i>the school…</i>

325
00:26:53,912 --> 00:26:55,080
<i>and Maria.</i>

326
00:26:57,983 --> 00:27:00,986
<i>The happenings in our town</i>
<i>have really gotten worse</i>

327
00:27:01,052 --> 00:27:02,520
<i>especially because</i> <i>of the misfortunes</i>

328
00:27:02,587 --> 00:27:05,023
<i>brought by the wickedness</i> <i>of the friars.</i>

329
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:07,258
<i>It's like a severe case</i> <i>of cancer</i>

330
00:27:08,259 --> 00:27:09,828
that cannot be cured.

331
00:27:09,894 --> 00:27:14,265
<i>An Indio, whatever clothes</i>
<i>he or she puts on,</i>

332
00:27:14,332 --> 00:27:16,668
<i>whatever he or she eats,</i>

333
00:27:16,735 --> 00:27:18,169
<i>he or she still remains an Indio.</i>

334
00:27:18,236 --> 00:27:21,373
He took my mother's dignity.

335
00:27:21,439 --> 00:27:25,010
<i>He also brought devastation</i>
<i>to you and your father.</i>

336
00:27:26,745 --> 00:27:29,147
<i>They killed Miss Sisa's son.</i>

337
00:27:29,214 --> 00:27:33,585
<i>They will oppress and</i>
<i>kill whoever they want.</i>

338
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:38,223
<i>His family, my father, Crispin,</i>
<i>and who else?</i>

339
00:27:38,289 --> 00:27:42,961
Your wealth is as much as our misfortune.

340
00:27:43,028 --> 00:27:44,696
You grew up living a good life,

341
00:27:44,763 --> 00:27:48,700
while my family died of
poverty and misery!

342
00:27:48,767 --> 00:27:51,436
<i>If you can promise that you</i>
<i>will come with us peacefully</i>

343
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:53,204
<i>and that you won't</i> <i>try to escape,</i>

344
00:27:53,271 --> 00:27:54,506
<i>we will not tie your hands.</i>

345
00:27:57,008 --> 00:27:58,543
Get out of the way, you fool!

346
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:09,988
<i>Are you the doctor who will help
heal San Diego?</i>

347
00:28:11,289 --> 00:28:16,761
<i>Or will you be like the other</i>
<i>rich people out there</i>

348
00:28:16,828 --> 00:28:20,532
<i>who will just turn a blind eye?</i>

349
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:28,073
Out of the way!

350
00:28:28,139 --> 00:28:29,641
-Out of the way!
-Out of the way!

351
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:30,942
Everybody, get out of the way!

352
00:28:33,978 --> 00:28:35,113
Get out of the way!

353
00:28:36,314 --> 00:28:37,282
Out of the way!

354
00:28:37,348 --> 00:28:38,416
Why did you stop?

355
00:28:38,483 --> 00:28:39,718
-Out of the way!
-Why?

356
00:28:43,154 --> 00:28:44,556
Why did you stop?

357
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:47,292
Señor is missing.

358
00:28:47,358 --> 00:28:49,194
Even my gun is missing.

359
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:50,095
What?

360
00:28:51,162 --> 00:28:53,131
That fool!

361
00:28:53,198 --> 00:28:54,099
Hurry!

362
00:28:54,165 --> 00:28:55,300
Find him!

363
00:28:55,366 --> 00:28:57,769
He has not gone that far yet!

364
00:28:57,836 --> 00:28:59,671
You go there!

365
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:01,740
-Yes, sir!
-We go this way!

366
00:29:01,806 --> 00:29:02,707
Let's go!

367
00:29:38,877 --> 00:29:42,113
It seems that I can already feel
the Christmas breeze.

368
00:29:44,382 --> 00:29:46,651
My cough is almost gone as well.

369
00:29:47,485 --> 00:29:48,586
Healing…

370
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:50,955
and a new hope.

371
00:29:52,157 --> 00:29:54,459
That will be the message of my sermon

372
00:29:54,526 --> 00:29:56,127
for the early morning mass.

373
00:29:56,661 --> 00:29:58,797
Thank you so much, Lord.

374
00:30:01,699 --> 00:30:04,335
The mass is about to start,
Your Reverence.

375
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:08,373
Very well, let's go.

376
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:06,364
Lord,

377
00:31:08,466 --> 00:31:12,704
please hear our prayer
for Señor Ibarra's safety.

378
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:18,910
This is a miracle, Tasyo.

379
00:31:19,477 --> 00:31:20,645
You came to the church today.

380
00:31:21,479 --> 00:31:24,115
I did not come here to
attend mass, Don Filipo.

381
00:31:25,083 --> 00:31:29,287
It's been a while since I've seen a show

382
00:31:29,354 --> 00:31:31,923
performed from the pulpit.

383
00:31:54,946 --> 00:31:55,780
Goodness.

384
00:31:56,681 --> 00:31:57,982
Does the tradition of completing

385
00:31:58,049 --> 00:31:59,918
the nine-day mass begin
during this time period?

386
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:03,721
I don't think I will be able to complete

387
00:32:03,788 --> 00:32:06,157
the nine early morning masses
this Christmas.

388
00:32:06,224 --> 00:32:08,526
Do they already believe that
wishes will be granted

389
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:10,862
if you complete all the early
morning masses?

390
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:15,433
I have gotten used to
carrying on my family's tradition

391
00:32:16,701 --> 00:32:20,805
even if I'm already an orphan now.

392
00:32:22,073 --> 00:32:24,909
But it is more important
that we help our friend.

393
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:26,744
Miss Klay.

394
00:32:27,245 --> 00:32:30,181
Let's go to the headquarters now

395
00:32:30,248 --> 00:32:32,984
to check on Crisostomo's situation.

396
00:32:37,822 --> 00:32:38,890
Mister Torres?

397
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:42,427
Wait, time first. I'll be quick.

398
00:32:45,997 --> 00:32:47,298
Miss Klay!

399
00:32:47,365 --> 00:32:48,833
Mister Torres!

400
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:50,001
Mister Torres!

401
00:32:51,002 --> 00:32:52,003
Miss Infantes?

402
00:32:53,371 --> 00:32:55,306
There are so many things going on.

403
00:32:56,307 --> 00:32:58,443
Is the story about to end?

404
00:32:58,509 --> 00:33:00,678
What will happen here?

405
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:03,381
Sorry, I wasn't able to read this part.

406
00:33:04,182 --> 00:33:05,183
Me too.

407
00:33:06,751 --> 00:33:08,419
What do you mean by that?

408
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:11,322
But you know the whole story, right?

409
00:33:11,389 --> 00:33:13,825
I know everything that happened
in Noli Me Tangere.

410
00:33:13,891 --> 00:33:16,394
But not this version of
the story that you created.

411
00:33:17,895 --> 00:33:19,964
What do you mean the version
of the story I created?

412
00:33:20,965 --> 00:33:21,966
Wait…

413
00:33:24,302 --> 00:33:27,338
So, what you told me back then
was fake news?

414
00:33:27,405 --> 00:33:30,408
So I was able to change the story!

415
00:33:30,975 --> 00:33:35,313
I thought you could only change
how the story unfolds,

416
00:33:36,147 --> 00:33:40,251
but it would still end as it was written.

417
00:33:41,719 --> 00:33:45,223
But now, Miss Infantes, I don't know.

418
00:33:46,057 --> 00:33:47,425
I don't know anymore!

419
00:33:50,962 --> 00:33:52,030
Miss Klay?

420
00:33:53,264 --> 00:33:54,699
Hold on.

421
00:33:56,434 --> 00:33:57,502
Mister Torres?

422
00:33:58,569 --> 00:33:59,637
Klay.

423
00:34:00,805 --> 00:34:02,106
Who are you talking to?

424
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:08,713
What do you mean you can't find him?

425
00:34:10,815 --> 00:34:12,750
Where else can he possibly go?

426
00:34:24,662 --> 00:34:25,763
San Diego!

427
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:28,232
Sir Ibarra?

428
00:34:28,299 --> 00:34:29,667
Listen, all of you!

429
00:34:30,668 --> 00:34:32,904
Good God in heaven.

430
00:34:32,970 --> 00:34:35,907
Everyone, listen!

431
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:38,409
Mister Crisostomo Ibarra?

432
00:34:39,277 --> 00:34:40,912
What nonsense are you doing?

433
00:34:42,613 --> 00:34:44,015
My goodness.

434
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:46,517
Good heavens, it is Crisostomo.

435
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:52,924
The son of the devil!

436
00:34:53,958 --> 00:34:54,992
Stop him.

437
00:34:55,059 --> 00:34:57,028
Call the civil guards.

438
00:35:07,738 --> 00:35:09,440
He escaped from the civil guards?

439
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:12,343
This would cause a big commotion.

440
00:35:17,248 --> 00:35:21,686
Miss, sir, our friend needs help.

441
00:35:27,258 --> 00:35:30,061
Señor Crisostomo Ibarra
is inside the church!

442
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:31,662
He is at the pulpit!

443
00:35:32,597 --> 00:35:34,732
What did you say?

444
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:36,634
Why did he go there?

445
00:35:36,701 --> 00:35:37,568
Hurry!

446
00:35:37,635 --> 00:35:38,703
Let's go!

447
00:35:40,505 --> 00:35:42,073
Let's close the doors.

448
00:35:47,278 --> 00:35:48,379
Close the door.

449
00:35:54,452 --> 00:35:55,953
Stay right where you are…

450
00:36:00,191 --> 00:36:02,260
If you don't want any trouble!

451
00:36:05,296 --> 00:36:09,433
I just want to share my sentiments.

452
00:36:11,736 --> 00:36:14,672
I don't want to put anyone else in danger.

453
00:36:15,239 --> 00:36:16,807
So, I beg you.

454
00:36:18,042 --> 00:36:19,777
Listen to me!

455
00:36:20,778 --> 00:36:23,381
Crisostomo, that's enough.

456
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:28,586
Stop disrespecting the house of God.

457
00:36:29,287 --> 00:36:31,055
Your Reverence!

458
00:36:32,623 --> 00:36:34,425
What is disrespectful

459
00:36:35,059 --> 00:36:38,029
about asking for forgiveness in
front of the messengers of God,

460
00:36:38,095 --> 00:36:40,498
and in front of the whole town
of San Diego?

461
00:36:43,401 --> 00:36:46,671
Leave now. Get up if you want to be saved!

462
00:36:46,737 --> 00:36:48,773
Get up, leave now!

463
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:50,875
Nobody is leaving!

464
00:36:53,444 --> 00:36:55,079
Everybody sit down!

465
00:36:56,814 --> 00:36:59,417
I don't want anybody to get hurt!

466
00:37:00,785 --> 00:37:02,753
So listen to me!

467
00:37:10,695 --> 00:37:12,063
Push the door!

468
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:15,533
In the name of the fathers,

469
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:19,837
the mothers, the children,

470
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:21,906
and the whole town of San Diego.

471
00:37:23,941 --> 00:37:26,344
I ask forgiveness from all of you.

472
00:37:28,112 --> 00:37:30,314
For I have sinned.

473
00:37:30,381 --> 00:37:33,551
In front of you, of God,

474
00:37:34,385 --> 00:37:36,087
and in front of this whole town!

475
00:37:36,654 --> 00:37:37,521
So now,

476
00:37:38,723 --> 00:37:41,292
allow me to expose to you…

477
00:37:41,959 --> 00:37:44,862
The sickness of this society!

478
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:46,564
Which I only made worse

479
00:37:48,366 --> 00:37:50,034
and was made worse

480
00:37:50,835 --> 00:37:52,303
by all of you!

481
00:38:02,513 --> 00:38:04,782
Force the door open!

482
00:38:05,383 --> 00:38:06,417
Push harder!

483
00:38:08,853 --> 00:38:11,589
Perhaps, after this, I will be imprisoned.

484
00:38:12,823 --> 00:38:16,427
For a sin that was made up

485
00:38:16,494 --> 00:38:18,462
which I have nothing to do with.

486
00:38:20,031 --> 00:38:22,199
Just like my father

487
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,002
who was sentenced and died

488
00:38:26,203 --> 00:38:29,974
for a crime that was purely
invented by those in power!

489
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:38,115
But I must admit…

490
00:38:39,417 --> 00:38:41,285
that if I have ever sinned,

491
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,689
I have sinned to this town!

492
00:38:45,723 --> 00:38:47,758
Because I let myself believe

493
00:38:48,492 --> 00:38:51,796
that what happened to my father
would never happen again.

494
00:38:54,699 --> 00:38:56,434
I acted like a cripple

495
00:38:57,768 --> 00:39:01,038
who leaned on the power
of the foreigners for support

496
00:39:02,606 --> 00:39:08,112
in my desire to help my town,
but I needed to bow down to them first!

497
00:39:10,114 --> 00:39:12,516
I pretended not to hear

498
00:39:13,284 --> 00:39:15,152
the cries of a mother.

499
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:18,089
Like Miss Sisa…

500
00:39:20,758 --> 00:39:26,630
<i>who was robbed of the dignity
and the lives of her sons.</i>

501
00:39:32,903 --> 00:39:34,572
<i>I turned a blind eye…</i>

502
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,976
to the disclosures of my friend.

503
00:39:43,914 --> 00:39:45,816
I closed my eyes

504
00:39:46,851 --> 00:39:48,285
to the corruption,

505
00:39:49,954 --> 00:39:53,491
abuses, and insults of the invaders

506
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:59,864
towards our fathers,
our mothers, brothers, children!

507
00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:03,701
Whether mestizo or Indio, rich or poor!

508
00:40:04,535 --> 00:40:06,270
They made no exception

509
00:40:07,671 --> 00:40:09,840
as long as they had native blood.

510
00:40:12,209 --> 00:40:18,082
They stole our honor,
and ruined our future,

511
00:40:18,149 --> 00:40:22,153
so that they can conquer us
with their power!

512
00:40:23,821 --> 00:40:26,357
Until all of us

513
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:28,893
become weak, become sick,

514
00:40:30,494 --> 00:40:32,596
and eventually die.

515
00:40:37,802 --> 00:40:41,572
This town has a cancer!

516
00:40:43,541 --> 00:40:44,909
A terminal illness

517
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:49,013
which our society has long
been complaining about!

518
00:40:49,079 --> 00:40:52,183
Which we inherited from our ancestors!

519
00:40:52,249 --> 00:40:56,787
Dumped into our families,
and even into our native land.

520
00:40:59,657 --> 00:41:02,626
So now, it is time.

521
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:06,730
For me to offer to this church,

522
00:41:07,798 --> 00:41:09,467
this sick town of ours.

523
00:41:11,235 --> 00:41:17,241
So please forgive me,
so that you can hear my prayer.

524
00:41:19,243 --> 00:41:22,847
Let us find a cure for this town!

525
00:41:25,449 --> 00:41:27,117
I beg you, San Diego.

526
00:41:28,652 --> 00:41:30,454
Hear my plea!

527
00:41:32,223 --> 00:41:33,757
Say it with me!

528
00:41:34,758 --> 00:41:36,460
Listen to your people!

529
00:41:38,229 --> 00:41:39,497
Hear our plea!

530
00:41:40,297 --> 00:41:43,367
The plea of people robbed of their power!

531
00:41:47,938 --> 00:41:49,073
-Clarita!
-Maria!

532
00:41:49,139 --> 00:41:50,808
-Maria!
-Maria!

533
00:41:50,875 --> 00:41:52,610
Hear our plea!

534
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:02,486
Hear our plea!

535
00:42:05,689 --> 00:42:06,790
Hear our plea!

536
00:42:08,792 --> 00:42:10,294
Hear our plea!

537
00:42:10,995 --> 00:42:13,264
Hear our plea!

538
00:42:13,330 --> 00:42:14,798
Hear our plea!

539
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:16,834
Hear our plea!

540
00:42:20,971 --> 00:42:22,606
Hear our plea!

541
00:42:22,673 --> 00:42:24,208
-Hear our plea!
-Hear our plea!

542
00:42:24,275 --> 00:42:25,376
Hear our plea!

543
00:42:25,943 --> 00:42:27,344
-Hear our plea!
-Hear our plea!

544
00:42:27,411 --> 00:42:29,213
-Hear our plea!
-Hear our plea!

545
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:36,854
-Hear our plea!
-Hear our plea!

546
00:42:38,255 --> 00:42:39,890
-Hear our plea!
-That's enough.

547
00:42:39,957 --> 00:42:43,093
-Hear our plea!
-Listen to us!

548

00:43:44,755 --> 00:43:47,391
It is clear to me why
I want to help my friend.

566
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:50,394
<i>But you, boatman, what is your reason?</i>

567
00:43:50,461 --> 00:43:52,396
<i>All right, if we can't
get anything from here,</i>

568
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:53,697
<i>then arrest them!</i>

569
00:43:53,764 --> 00:43:54,598
What is happening?

570
00:43:54,665 --> 00:43:56,100
Why are they being arrested too?

571
00:43:56,166 --> 00:44:01,639
Miss Klay, it is better for you
to escape and hide in my store.

572
00:44:01,705 --> 00:44:03,941
What if something happens to you?

573
00:44:04,008 --> 00:44:06,043
-Basilio…
-Sisa, let's go.

574
00:44:06,110 --> 00:44:07,478
Leave us alone!

<i>I never thought</i>

<i>Crisostomo's life of freedom.</i>

578
00:44:14,485 --> 00:44:16,487
I did not write these letters!

579
00:44:16,553 --> 00:44:17,988
You will be imprisoned for life!

580
00:44:18,055 --> 00:44:20,924
<i>And you will face the penalty of death!</i>
