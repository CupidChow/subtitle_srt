MARIA CLARA AND IBARRA

2
00:00:31,631 --> 00:00:35,568
THIS PROGRAM, WHICH IS ADAPTED
FROM THE NOVELS OF DR. JOSE P. RIZAL,

3
00:00:35,635 --> 00:00:40,573
IS PRESENTED USING DRAMATIC ELEMENTS
TO CONNECT THE PRESENT AND THE PAST

4
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:46,446
IN A SPECIAL REIMAGINING OF THE NATIONAL
LITERATURE FILIPINOS ARE PROUD OF.

5
00:00:46,513 --> 00:00:48,148
<i>There was an important request</i>

6
00:00:48,815 --> 00:00:49,883
<i>that Father Salvi asked me.</i>

7
00:00:49,949 --> 00:00:50,950
<i>Your letters,</i>

8
00:00:51,451 --> 00:00:53,153
in exchange for my mother's letter.

9
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:55,855
<i>He said, if I don't give him your letters,</i>

10
00:00:55,922 --> 00:01:00,360
my father and godfather will be ruined
and humiliated in public.

11
00:01:00,427 --> 00:01:06,800
<i>We just wasted our time reading
Crisostomo Ibarra's letters!</i>

12
00:01:06,866 --> 00:01:11,037
Father, Sir Ibarra's penmanship…
is almost the same as yours.

13
00:01:11,704 --> 00:01:14,174
<i>See, Señor Alferez?</i>

14
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,076
<i>Ibarra is a traitor.</i>

15
00:01:16,142 --> 00:01:17,410
<i>You can compare the two.</i>

16
00:01:17,977 --> 00:01:20,680
<i>The handwritings of the two letters
are the same.</i>

17
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:21,748
<i>That is why I am sure</i>

18
00:01:21,815 --> 00:01:24,918
that it was indeed Crisostomo Ibarra
who wrote the letter.

19
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:26,886
<i>I can feel my son.</i>

20
00:01:27,387 --> 00:01:28,555
<i>Crispin is here.</i>

21
00:01:29,122 --> 00:01:30,790
<i>Did you see the face? Whose body is it?</i>

22
00:01:30,857 --> 00:01:33,626
<i>The face and body are already decaying.</i>

23
00:01:33,693 --> 00:01:34,861
<i>This is indeed Crispin.</i>

24
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:39,799
<i>My son!</i>

25
00:01:39,866 --> 00:01:41,401
<i>You need to escape right away.</i>

26
00:01:41,468 --> 00:01:42,869
Because any moment now,

27
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:45,572
the civil guards will be
arriving to arrest you!

28
00:01:45,638 --> 00:01:46,673
For what reason?

29
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:48,908
<i>For being the leader
of the upcoming revolt.</i>

30
00:01:48,975 --> 00:01:51,611
<i>But I have nothing to do with that revolt!</i>

31
00:01:51,678 --> 00:01:54,547
<i>Put your hands up and surrender!</i>

32
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:56,449
<i>Drop your weapons! Fire!</i>

33
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:02,455
<i>Do you know the person whose name
and signature are written here?</i>

34
00:02:02,522 --> 00:02:03,890
<i>He's my father's grandfather.</i>

35
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:08,728
<i>It was Don Pedro who ruined
the honor of my ancestors.</i>

36
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:13,133
<i>He's the reason why my whole family
suffered and was destroyed!</i>

37
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:16,569
<i>You are under arrest
for the crime of subversion.</i>

38
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:18,138
<i>Put down your weapons.</i>

39
00:02:18,204 --> 00:02:20,640
<i>I wish to prove to you</i>

40
00:02:20,707 --> 00:02:23,276
<i>that your accusations
against me are not true!</i>

41
00:02:23,843 --> 00:02:25,245
<i>I need your help.</i>

42
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:27,046
<i>Sisa is missing.</i>

43
00:02:27,113 --> 00:02:29,816
<i>And Sir Ibarra was arrested
by the civil guards and the General.</i>

44
00:02:30,617 --> 00:02:31,951
Why did you stop?

45
00:02:32,018 --> 00:02:33,620
He is missing.

46
00:02:33,686 --> 00:02:34,921
My gun too!

47
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:37,757
What? Damn it.

48
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:41,361
Hurry! Find him!
He has not gone that far yet!

49
00:02:41,427 --> 00:02:42,529
<i>Is the story about to end?</i>

50
00:02:42,595 --> 00:02:44,531
I know everything
that happened in Noli Me Tangere

51
00:02:44,597 --> 00:02:47,467
but not this version that you created.

52
00:02:47,534 --> 00:02:49,869
<i>I also don't know anymore!</i>

53
00:02:51,037 --> 00:02:52,272
San Diego!

54
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:53,606
Sir Ibarra?

55
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:55,008
Listen, all of you!

56
00:02:55,074 --> 00:02:57,777
This town has cancer!

57
00:02:57,844 --> 00:02:59,112
A terminal illness…

58
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:04,017
So now, it is time for me
to offer to this church…

59
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:06,019
Let us find a cure…

60
00:03:06,085 --> 00:03:08,488
I beg you, San Diego…

61
00:03:08,555 --> 00:03:09,489
Say it with me!

62
00:03:09,556 --> 00:03:10,957
Heed our plea!

63
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:13,893
Of people robbed of their power!

64
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,562
Heed our plea!

65
00:03:15,628 --> 00:03:16,663
Heed our plea!

66
00:03:16,729 --> 00:03:17,897
Heed our plea!

67
00:03:17,964 --> 00:03:19,098
Heed our plea!

68
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:21,734
-Heed our plea!
-Heed our plea!

69
00:03:21,801 --> 00:03:24,103
Heed our plea!

70
00:03:25,572 --> 00:03:30,510
<i>-Heed our plea!
-Heed our plea!</i>

71
00:03:30,577 --> 00:03:32,579
-Heed our plea!
-Heed our plea!

72
00:03:32,645 --> 00:03:33,713
-Heed our plea!
-Stop that!

73
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:36,049
Stop that! Where are the civil guards?

74
00:03:36,115 --> 00:03:37,550
-Heed our plea!
-Heed our plea!

75
00:03:38,117 --> 00:03:39,385
Stop it, you heretics!

76
00:03:39,452 --> 00:03:42,555
I said stop it! Shut up!

77
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:52,832
So, you have finally heard my plea.

78
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:59,339
Stop that now if you do not wish to die.

79
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:07,280
But we are countrymen.

80
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:09,349
We are all Filipinos.

81
00:04:56,029 --> 00:04:58,498
The show is over!

82
00:04:58,564 --> 00:05:00,967
If you are not here
to attend mass, just go home!

83
00:05:01,034 --> 00:05:02,935
Or else, I will have you arrested!

84
00:06:22,849 --> 00:06:24,917
Crisostomo…

85
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:17,804
Maria…

86
00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:27,180
You should not be sad, señorita.

87
00:07:27,246 --> 00:07:29,515
Because thanks to your help…

88
00:07:30,683 --> 00:07:36,522
we finally unmasked that
heretic and filibuster.

89
00:07:36,589 --> 00:07:41,994
If you are keeping letters
from Crisostomo Ibarra,

90
00:07:42,061 --> 00:07:43,529
I would like to have them.

91
00:07:43,596 --> 00:07:47,166
And why do you want to have
the letters from Crisostomo?

92
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:50,436
I am warning you, Maria.

93
00:07:50,503 --> 00:07:53,873
If I still don't have
your fiancé's letters…

94
00:07:55,174 --> 00:08:01,514
by tonight… I will be forced
to do what I must.

95
00:08:01,581 --> 00:08:06,018
Your family's dirty secret
will be revealed to all.

96
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:11,257
It seems that taking down the church
was not his only intention.

97
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:17,196
He also wanted to bring down
our government.

98
00:08:17,263 --> 00:08:19,532
For all the crimes he committed,

99
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:25,671
I am certain he will receive death
as punishment for being a filibuster.

100
00:08:28,241 --> 00:08:34,514
And aside from the things he proclaimed
before the people of San Diego…

101
00:08:37,483 --> 00:08:40,620
It was the letter…

102
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:45,625
The one you gave me, Maria…

103
00:08:46,993 --> 00:08:49,362
That became the key…

104
00:08:49,428 --> 00:08:51,397
To his destruction.

105
00:08:52,798 --> 00:08:56,802
So, thank you very much, Maria.

106
00:08:58,638 --> 00:09:02,008
Thank you very much.

107
00:09:05,912 --> 00:09:07,280
Father…

108
00:09:18,824 --> 00:09:20,693
Stop crying.

109
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,662
Do not cry, my love.

110
00:09:25,665 --> 00:09:28,200
I do not remember writing
anything in my letters

111
00:09:28,267 --> 00:09:30,570
that would put me in a bad light.

112
00:09:31,604 --> 00:09:34,507
I am sure of his purpose for doing that.

113
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:37,543
He wants to find anything
that is subversive.

114
00:09:39,378 --> 00:09:42,048
So, don't worry.

115
00:09:42,114 --> 00:09:43,683
Because I understand that.

116
00:09:49,455 --> 00:09:50,690
Maria!

117
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:01,661
<i>My son, stay here.</i>

118
00:11:01,727 --> 00:11:03,496
<i>Do not leave your mother, okay?</i>

119
00:11:03,562 --> 00:11:07,233
<i>Whatever happens,
you, your brother Crispin, and I</i>

120
00:11:07,299 --> 00:11:10,136
<i>will all go home to our hut, okay?</i>

121
00:11:11,303 --> 00:11:12,872
Right.

122
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:21,781
We will all be together
in our home, my children.

123
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:23,449
Sisa, we need to leave.

124
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:26,352
The civil guards are probably
looking for me right now.

125
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:28,954
Basilio…

126
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:33,993
Is Basilio coming here?

127
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:35,761
Sisa, didn't you hear me?

128
00:11:35,828 --> 00:11:39,398
Are you coming with me or
do you just want to stay here?

129
00:11:43,402 --> 00:11:45,705
Basilio…

130
00:11:48,074 --> 00:11:52,812
-Sisa!
-Crispin and I are waiting for you here.

131
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:54,447
-Sisa, let's go.
-Basilio…

132
00:11:54,513 --> 00:11:55,381
Basilio.

133
00:11:55,448 --> 00:11:57,116
-Sisa, let's go.
-Basilio!

134
00:11:57,183 --> 00:11:58,184
That's enough!

135
00:11:59,452 --> 00:12:00,820
Leave us alone!

136
00:12:01,987 --> 00:12:03,355
Let's go, Sisa.

137
00:12:03,422 --> 00:12:04,790
Leave us alone!

138
00:12:05,825 --> 00:12:07,793
Leave us alone!

139
00:12:10,863 --> 00:12:12,298
-Stop that, let's go.
-Leave us alone.

140
00:12:12,364 --> 00:12:14,033
-Let's go…
-Leave us alone.

141
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,134
Leave us alone!

142
00:12:15,201 --> 00:12:21,107
Leave us alone! Leave us alone!

143
00:12:22,108 --> 00:12:22,975
My son?

144
00:12:24,643 --> 00:12:27,113
Sleep now…

145
00:13:02,515 --> 00:13:04,083
-Adong…
-Señorito?

146
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:06,085
Who is at Ibarra's house?

147
00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:07,019
Where are his things?

148
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,955
Señorita Klay is there.

149
00:13:11,991 --> 00:13:14,160
My God…

150
00:13:14,226 --> 00:13:15,327
Let us go.

151
00:13:27,273 --> 00:13:29,475
Is this all his things?

152
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:30,743
I think so.

153
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:34,013
The civil guards suddenly arrived
after you walked out on us earlier.

154
00:13:40,286 --> 00:13:42,121
Here's the gun again.

155
00:13:52,798 --> 00:13:54,233
Let me have this.

156
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:58,404
I am sure that the civil guards
will come back to search the house.

157
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:03,309
I am certain that they will use
even a tiny shard of glass

158
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:05,778
just to incriminate Señor Ibarra.

159
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:14,320
We need to hurry.

160
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:21,327
Let's finish this.

161
00:14:21,393 --> 00:14:22,962
Hold on.

162
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:27,366
It is clear to me why I want
to help my friend.

163
00:14:27,433 --> 00:14:30,636
But you, boatman, what is your reason?

164
00:14:34,006 --> 00:14:35,708
Right.

165
00:14:35,774 --> 00:14:37,610
Why are you helping again

166
00:14:37,676 --> 00:14:41,347
after what happened between
you and Sir Ibarra earlier?

167
00:14:41,413 --> 00:14:44,783
If this fight is going to succeed…

168
00:14:46,151 --> 00:14:49,288
I need to be selfless

169
00:14:49,355 --> 00:14:53,726
and set aside the events in the past
for the sake of this country's future.

170
00:14:54,994 --> 00:14:56,095
We are running out of time.

171
00:14:56,161 --> 00:14:58,063
Let's hurry.

172
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,580
Cousin…

173
00:15:15,281 --> 00:15:17,483
Maybe there is something you can do?

174
00:15:17,549 --> 00:15:20,753
You are friends with
the Archbishop, right?

175
00:15:20,819 --> 00:15:25,124
And you are also friends
with the Captain General?

176
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:28,961
Maybe you know someone in Manila
who can help them.

177
00:15:29,028 --> 00:15:30,963
Please help them, cousin.

178
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:33,032
Help Crisostomo too.

179
00:15:36,502 --> 00:15:38,537
Things cannot be remedied anymore.

180
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:49,048
Maria?

181
00:15:50,749 --> 00:15:52,451
What are you saying?

182
00:15:58,857 --> 00:16:00,859
I never thought…

183
00:16:02,161 --> 00:16:04,430
That a mere piece of paper

184
00:16:04,496 --> 00:16:09,068
would be the wick that would burn
Crisostomo's life of freedom.

185
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:20,346
There is nothing I can do…

186
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:27,519
I am like…

187
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:34,393
I am like a mere instrument
of the villains of a story.

188
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:37,997
That we are only characters of a story?

189
00:16:38,063 --> 00:16:40,699
That my godfather is the villain?

190
00:16:40,766 --> 00:16:43,569
Father Damaso is not a good person.

191
00:16:43,635 --> 00:16:45,237
He is ruthless, señorita.

192
00:16:45,304 --> 00:16:47,506
He might be in connivance
with that bald priest,

193
00:16:47,573 --> 00:16:49,975
Father Salvi.

194
00:16:57,316 --> 00:16:58,817
Maria…

195
00:17:00,586 --> 00:17:01,887
That's enough.

196
00:17:01,954 --> 00:17:04,523
I beg you…

197
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:06,892
There is nothing you can do.

198
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:08,193
That's enough.

199
00:17:09,495 --> 00:17:11,330
That's enough, my dear.

200
00:17:30,249 --> 00:17:32,351
That's enough…

201
00:19:25,364 --> 00:19:29,101
<i>The light of hope for San Diego</i>

202
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:33,805
<i>was tainted by darkness.</i>

203
00:20:41,306 --> 00:20:45,210
<i>The light of our consciousness</i>

204
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:52,551
<i>was buried by darkness in a shallow grave.</i>

205
00:20:54,253 --> 00:21:00,626
<i>Tears accompany the sad truth.</i>

206
00:21:00,692 --> 00:21:03,895
<i>What hope is left</i>

207
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:11,603
<i>for those who break
the promises they made?</i>

208
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:16,308
<i>But there are a few</i>

209
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:21,446
<i>who are unafraid of the coming darkness.</i>

210
00:21:21,513 --> 00:21:27,052
<i>Instead, they will welcome it
wholeheartedly.</i>

211
00:21:29,921 --> 00:21:32,491
<i>How bitter…</i>

212
00:21:33,392 --> 00:21:39,965
<i>that my fate is to not witness</i>

213
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:45,103
<i>the awakening of my country.</i>

214
00:21:46,672 --> 00:21:51,243
<i>May the light that was buried</i>

215
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:56,982
<i>be found again</i>

216
00:21:57,049 --> 00:22:01,586
<i>by the youth who yearn…</i>

217
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:07,559
<i>for a great freedom.</i>

218
00:22:09,528 --> 00:22:10,395
Mother!

219
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:13,999
Mother… Mother!

220
00:22:15,434 --> 00:22:16,368
Basilio?

221
00:22:16,435 --> 00:22:18,737
Basilio, Basilio!

222
00:22:18,804 --> 00:22:21,173
There, there.

223
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:27,546
You were having a bad dream again, child.

224
00:22:27,612 --> 00:22:32,017
Wait, I will get you
a glass of water to calm you down.

225
00:22:32,084 --> 00:22:34,653
Thank you, Mister Tales.

226
00:22:36,922 --> 00:22:38,290
Wait here.

227
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:47,432
It is already late in the evening
but what's important

228
00:22:47,499 --> 00:22:49,801
is we were able
to go through the entire house.

229
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:53,205
We have enough materials in the backyard.

230
00:22:53,271 --> 00:22:56,208
Everything we need to start
the pyre is ready.

231
00:22:56,742 --> 00:22:58,877
But there's still a lot
to go through here.

232
00:22:58,944 --> 00:23:01,313
Adong, the Sergeant is here.

233
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:07,252
Adong, greet them respectfully.

234
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:08,687
I will be right behind you.

235
00:23:08,754 --> 00:23:10,122
All right, señorito.

236
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:16,695
Miss Klay, continue what we're doing here.

237
00:23:16,762 --> 00:23:18,230
We will take care of the civil guards.

238
00:23:18,296 --> 00:23:19,631
No, I'll go with you.

239
00:23:19,698 --> 00:23:21,600
Miss Klay, no.

240
00:23:21,666 --> 00:23:23,802
You and Elias should finish up here.

241
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:27,539
Wait.

242
00:23:27,606 --> 00:23:28,974
Be careful.

243
00:23:46,992 --> 00:23:49,394
Elias, we don't have much time.

244
00:23:49,461 --> 00:23:51,630
How are we going to get rid
of these sacks?

245
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:05,710
We are here to confiscate
any and all evidence

246
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:10,015
that links to the arrest
of Crisostomo Ibarra.

247
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:15,253
To my friend?

248
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:22,661
Do you have permission
from the Alferez or the Mayor?

249
00:24:22,727 --> 00:24:23,895
Permission?

250
00:24:25,664 --> 00:24:28,166
Can I see it?

251
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:35,273
I just want to make sure
that no laws are violated here.

252
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:47,686
Wait a minute, I am still reading it.

253
00:24:47,752 --> 00:24:52,190
Sir, it is also stated there
that everything we will confiscate

254
00:24:52,257 --> 00:24:56,495
will be returned to you
after our investigation.

255
00:25:12,711 --> 00:25:14,546
My God!

256
00:25:14,613 --> 00:25:18,950
This is exactly what happens
in the movies and dramas I watch.

257
00:25:57,355 --> 00:25:59,124
We don't have time, señor!

258
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:00,659
Search the entire house!

259
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:03,728
Take everything, all the money
and the documents!

260
00:26:04,863 --> 00:26:07,666
Sir, I smell something burning!

261
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:09,634
-Burning?
-Yes!

262
00:26:36,328 --> 00:26:37,429
Hide!

263
00:26:38,897 --> 00:26:42,334
Alright, if there's nothing
we can get here, then arrest them!

264
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,335
What do you mean?

265
00:26:43,401 --> 00:26:47,172
Arrest everyone connected
to Crisostomo Ibarra.

266
00:26:47,238 --> 00:26:51,343
All the men who support
Señor Crisostomo Ibarra

267
00:26:51,409 --> 00:26:55,647
may also be connected
to the halted revolt.

268
00:26:55,714 --> 00:26:56,915
Go on!

269
00:26:56,982 --> 00:26:59,050
Take them all to headquarters!

270
00:27:00,719 --> 00:27:02,587
Wait! Let us go!

271
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:04,990
We need to escape now!

272
00:27:06,825 --> 00:27:07,926
You go ahead.

273
00:27:07,993 --> 00:27:10,028
Miss.

274
00:27:10,095 --> 00:27:11,363
Miss!

275
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:15,600
Wait! Wait!

276
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:22,040
What's happening? Why are they
also being arrested?

277
00:27:22,107 --> 00:27:23,408
Do not fear, Miss Klay.

278
00:27:24,109 --> 00:27:26,578
I am sure this will not take long.

279
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:29,514
I am Fidel Reyes y Maglipol.

280
00:27:29,581 --> 00:27:32,517
Once we get to headquarters,

281
00:27:32,584 --> 00:27:35,553
they will be surprised
by our family's best lawyers.

282
00:27:36,888 --> 00:27:37,856
You fool!

283
00:27:37,922 --> 00:27:40,825
How can you still be so arrogant
while getting arrested?

284
00:27:42,694 --> 00:27:46,965
If you're going to arrest them,
you should also arrest me.

285
00:27:47,032 --> 00:27:48,133
Move!

286
00:27:48,199 --> 00:27:50,669
Just let us arrest the men!

287
00:27:50,735 --> 00:27:51,970
Huh?

288
00:27:52,037 --> 00:27:53,972
Why? Because I'm a woman?

289
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:57,509
I'm not sure if I should be insulted
or glad because of that excuse.

290
00:27:58,710 --> 00:27:59,811
Miss Klay…

291
00:28:03,248 --> 00:28:05,417
Sergeant…

292
00:28:05,483 --> 00:28:11,923
Before we leave, may I first
please talk to my wife?

293
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:13,558
Huh?

294
00:28:13,625 --> 00:28:15,026
Wife?

295
00:28:30,408 --> 00:28:35,914
Miss Klay, it is better for you
to escape and hide in my store.

296
00:28:36,781 --> 00:28:39,751
My staff will take care of you.

297
00:28:39,818 --> 00:28:41,219
No.

298
00:28:41,286 --> 00:28:42,754
I'll come with you.

299
00:28:42,821 --> 00:28:44,923
I will go wherever
they take you and Sir Ibarra.

300
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:48,927
Miss Klay…

301
00:28:48,993 --> 00:28:55,166
Ibarra and I need someone outside
to help us while we are inside the prison.

302
00:28:56,901 --> 00:29:00,038
What if something bad happens to you?

303
00:29:00,105 --> 00:29:01,840
To both of you!

304
00:29:03,842 --> 00:29:06,244
Miss…

305
00:29:06,311 --> 00:29:08,113
I promise…

306
00:29:08,179 --> 00:29:14,719
Nothing bad will happen to Ibarra
and especially to me.

307
00:29:14,786 --> 00:29:18,256
And as soon as everything
has been resolved,

308
00:29:18,323 --> 00:29:21,226
you'll be the first person I'll find.

309
00:29:25,396 --> 00:29:27,332
Okay!

310
00:29:33,071 --> 00:29:34,873
Let us go!

311
00:29:38,143 --> 00:29:39,077
Wait, wait, wait.

312
00:29:39,144 --> 00:29:42,180
I will go. I told you
not to touch me, right?

313
00:29:42,247 --> 00:29:46,551
It seems like my knowledge
of the law will be of use again.

314
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:49,921
I know my privileges and rights.

315
00:29:49,988 --> 00:29:51,523
You will all see!

316
00:29:55,693 --> 00:29:57,395
Very well, my wife…

317
00:29:59,898 --> 00:30:01,432
Bye.

318
00:30:03,902 --> 00:30:05,737
Bye.

319
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:07,272
Go now.

320
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:10,375
Let us go.

321
00:30:48,313 --> 00:30:49,314
What?

322
00:30:50,014 --> 00:30:55,920
The General gave the order to arrest
anyone associated with Don Crisostomo?

323
00:30:55,987 --> 00:30:59,791
Which includes Don Fidel, Don Filipo,
the schoolteacher.

324
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:01,926
They were supposed to arrest
Mister Anastacio too,

325
00:31:01,993 --> 00:31:04,996
but he fainted while they were gathered
outside the prison.

326
00:31:05,063 --> 00:31:06,598
Unfortunately, he died.

327
00:31:06,664 --> 00:31:08,066
My God.

328
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,201
Tell them to prepare the carriage.

329
00:31:10,268 --> 00:31:12,370
Will they arrest us too?

330
00:31:12,437 --> 00:31:14,105
It is better to be sure.

331
00:31:14,172 --> 00:31:16,741
Especially you, Santiago.

332
00:31:16,808 --> 00:31:20,111
I need to bring my family
to my house in Bulacan.

333
00:31:20,178 --> 00:31:22,013
It is better to be safe.

334
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,349
We will spend some time there.

335
00:31:24,415 --> 00:31:26,084
Be careful, Captain Tiago.

336
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:28,753
You as well as your only daughter.

337
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:30,622
Goodbye.

338
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:50,541
Señorito…

339
00:31:50,608 --> 00:31:53,144
-Wait, why…
-You have your own prison cell.

340
00:31:53,211 --> 00:31:54,779
Keep walking.

341
00:31:54,846 --> 00:31:55,980
Let us go.

342
00:32:46,164 --> 00:32:51,169
Thank you very much,
Elias, Pablito, and Lucia.

343
00:32:51,235 --> 00:32:53,705
I didn't know where else to go.

344
00:32:53,771 --> 00:32:57,075
Consider this forest your home.

345
00:32:57,141 --> 00:32:59,944
It seems you have already forgotten, miss.

346
00:33:00,011 --> 00:33:03,247
I owe you the freedom that I have now.

347
00:33:07,452 --> 00:33:12,724
But the people I owe a great deal
in this place are imprisoned.

348
00:33:19,197 --> 00:33:21,366
Or missing…

349
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:25,103
Sisa. My God.

350
00:33:26,471 --> 00:33:27,939
So many things are happening.

351
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:30,508
I don't know what I'm going to do.

352
00:33:30,575 --> 00:33:32,110
Sisa?

353
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:36,180
The mother of the sacristan
who was found dead?

354
00:33:42,053 --> 00:33:44,856
Crispin and Basilio's mother.

355
00:33:48,126 --> 00:33:50,628
I need to help her.

356
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:53,865
Or put her in a safer place.

357
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:59,504
But I also need to get Sir Ibarra
and Fidel out of prison.

358
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:02,640
I don't know what I need to do first.

359
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:09,080
I think you are in need of
a group to help you

360
00:34:09,147 --> 00:34:11,883
with the many problems
you are facing in this town.

361
00:34:14,786 --> 00:34:17,455
Take a rest for now, miss.

362
00:34:17,522 --> 00:34:22,627
Even warriors need to rest

363
00:34:22,693 --> 00:34:26,998
so that they will regain
strength and clarity of mind

364
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:29,233
to be able to fight again.

365
00:34:36,541 --> 00:34:37,875
Ali?

366
00:34:40,378 --> 00:34:42,914
A firefly, miss.

367
00:34:44,449 --> 00:34:50,388
Yes, but we eventually became friends.

368
00:34:50,455 --> 00:34:54,225
That firefly has been with me
in everything I've been through.

369
00:34:54,292 --> 00:34:57,095
That's why I named it Ali.

370
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:02,767
They always come here too.

371
00:35:02,834 --> 00:35:05,970
Maybe they too, have become our friends.

372
00:35:06,037 --> 00:35:09,574
They serve as our helpers, our supporters…

373
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:11,709
Or guide…

374
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:17,648
So we may see even the faintest light
in the dark night.

375
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:20,218
That's deep.

376
00:35:21,319 --> 00:35:23,020
But it's beautiful.

377
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:29,694
Again, thank you very much

378
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:32,964
because there are people
like you who empathize with me.

379
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:53,117
<i>Do you remember the day</i>
<i>that you violated me?</i>

380
00:35:53,184 --> 00:35:56,187
<i>You are evil, friar!</i>

381
00:35:56,254 --> 00:35:57,655
Clarita?

382
00:35:59,357 --> 00:36:00,958
Clarita?

383
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:03,628
Clarita?

384
00:36:15,106 --> 00:36:19,277
Clarita, is there something troubling you?

385
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:23,548
My dear, tell me.

386
00:36:23,614 --> 00:36:26,017
I will understand.

387
00:36:29,654 --> 00:36:31,355
Clarita?

388
00:36:36,294 --> 00:36:37,461
Maria…

389
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:39,530
Isabel…

390
00:36:39,597 --> 00:36:43,501
The General gave the order to arrest
everyone associated with Crisostomo.

391
00:36:43,568 --> 00:36:46,204
-My God…
-We need to leave San Diego.

392
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:48,839
It is better to be safe.
We might get involved in their trouble.

393
00:36:48,906 --> 00:36:50,308
Yes, cousin.

394
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:52,143
Clarita, let us go.

395
00:36:54,845 --> 00:36:56,714
I will stay here, father.

396
00:36:56,781 --> 00:36:58,082
What are you saying?

397
00:36:58,149 --> 00:37:00,418
Come on, start packing.

398
00:37:00,484 --> 00:37:02,486
Hurry up. Come on.

399
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:05,156
If you want to leave,
no one will stop you.

400
00:37:07,758 --> 00:37:13,030
But I will stay here in San Diego,
to be with Crisostomo.

401
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:08,919
Basilio…

402
00:38:12,356 --> 00:38:15,393
Crispin and I are just here in our hut.

403
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:23,100
In our home.

404
00:38:27,872 --> 00:38:33,577
No matter what happens
you will all see each other at the hut.

405
00:38:44,789 --> 00:38:48,359
I knew I would find you here, Sisa.

406
00:38:51,862 --> 00:38:53,264
Come!

407
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:54,432
Come.

408
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:56,067
Come, quick!

409
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:25,563
Looks like you are happy here.

410
00:39:28,632 --> 00:39:30,634
I will stay here.

411
00:39:34,638 --> 00:39:36,774
I will not leave.

412
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:44,115
I will stay here…

413
00:39:45,683 --> 00:39:48,986
Until I am reunited with my sons.

414
00:39:55,960 --> 00:40:00,798
Crispin, Klay is here now.

415
00:40:07,171 --> 00:40:10,875
It's just your big brother Basilio
who has not returned yet.

416
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:21,485
My admiration for you is there, señor.

417
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:25,423
But even admiration has its limits.

418
00:40:27,691 --> 00:40:34,365
Especially if the person you admire
is secretly a filibuster.

419
00:40:35,966 --> 00:40:40,938
The Captain General knows
the whole identity of my clan.

420
00:40:41,005 --> 00:40:44,575
And I thought you knew that too, Alferez.

421
00:40:44,642 --> 00:40:46,444
That's right.

422
00:40:47,545 --> 00:40:53,884
But the identity of a clan may change
with its succeeding generations.

423
00:40:58,456 --> 00:41:03,727
It's already a given that your father
and the Captain General are friends.

424
00:41:05,496 --> 00:41:09,667
But our loyalty to the King of Spain
is what prevails,

425
00:41:09,733 --> 00:41:11,702
and not just to any friendship.

426
00:41:18,576 --> 00:41:23,681
Aside from your show earlier,
I also read the contents of those letters

427
00:41:24,915 --> 00:41:27,585
which came directly from your fiancée.

428
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:35,259
And I was surprised… by your letters.

429
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:39,063
You mentioned in those letters
your criticism of the way

430
00:41:39,129 --> 00:41:42,666
the government runs,
the alleged corruption…

431
00:41:44,235 --> 00:41:47,438
And oppression by
government officials.

432
00:41:48,606 --> 00:41:53,811
When did I ever write to my fiancée
using those kinds of words?

433
00:42:03,187 --> 00:42:07,291
Did you really not write
about the lack of justice?

434
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:10,194
About changing society,
that the only way to do it

435
00:42:10,261 --> 00:42:15,966
is by revolting and bringing down
those who are powerful in society?

436
00:42:18,903 --> 00:42:21,472
I did not write these letters.

437
00:42:23,007 --> 00:42:27,378
Even though I agree that there is
a need for change and justice,

438
00:42:27,444 --> 00:42:32,683
I do not agree to violence as a means
to eradicate corruption and oppression

439
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:34,285
by government officials.

440
00:42:34,351 --> 00:42:38,122
Be careful with the words
you are uttering now, señor!

441
00:42:38,188 --> 00:42:40,424
You might not have written these letters,

442
00:42:40,491 --> 00:42:43,160
but I am here and I can hear you!

443
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:46,697
It is good that you are listening.

444
00:42:47,932 --> 00:42:51,602
Would you like to recant
what you just said now?

445
00:42:51,669 --> 00:42:54,371
And what you said earlier?

446
00:42:54,438 --> 00:42:56,574
There is nothing to recant, señor.

447
00:42:57,274 --> 00:43:00,411
The words I said earlier
were not to urge anyone.

448
00:43:00,477 --> 00:43:05,082
It was a prayer that I hope
the higher-ups can hear,

449
00:43:05,149 --> 00:43:09,887
the plea of all the natives in this town.

450
00:43:09,954 --> 00:43:12,957
With what you just said,
you will be imprisoned for life!

451
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:16,060
And face the penalty of death!

452
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:54,498
<i>Perhaps you have finally severed ties
with the filibuster Ibarra.</i>

453
00:43:54,565 --> 00:43:58,802
<i>In that case, we can continue
discussing the proposed marriage</i>

454
00:43:58,869 --> 00:44:01,772
<i>between Alfonso and Maria Clara!</i>

455
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:04,241
<i>I hope you bear this
in your young mind, my dear.</i>

456
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:08,979
That no matter how deep or painful
the wounds we incur in life,

457
00:44:09,046 --> 00:44:10,948
<i>everything will be healed one day.</i>

458
00:44:11,015 --> 00:44:13,017
<i>Crispin!</i>

459
00:44:13,083 --> 00:44:16,387
COMING UP…

460
00:44:16,453 --> 00:44:20,691
<i>Isn't it better if two women
will be going there tonight?</i>

461
00:44:20,758 --> 00:44:21,792
<i>Count me in.</i>

462
00:44:21,859 --> 00:44:23,861
Whatever that is, I can do it!

463
00:44:25,129 --> 00:44:28,132
<i>You want to fight for the freedom
of Ibarra and his friends as a woman?</i>

464
00:44:28,198 --> 00:44:31,235
<i>But can you handle
being a prostitute tonight?</i>

465
00:44:40,377 --> 00:44:43,647
