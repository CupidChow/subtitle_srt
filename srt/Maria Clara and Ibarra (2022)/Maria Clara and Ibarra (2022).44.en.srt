00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:26,559
MARIA CLARA AND IBARRA

2
00:00:27,327 --> 00:00:30,964
THIS PROGRAM, WHICH IS ADAPTED
FROM THE NOVELS OF DR. JOSE P. RIZAL,

3
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:34,868
IS PRESENTED USING DRAMATIC ELEMENTS
TO CONNECT THE PRESENT AND THE PAST

4
00:00:34,934 --> 00:00:38,605
IN A SPECIAL REIMAGINING OF THE NATIONAL
LITERATURE FILIPINOS ARE PROUD OF.

5
00:00:39,105 --> 00:00:40,940
<i>It's been thirteen years.</i>

6
00:00:41,441 --> 00:00:45,245
<i>Where are you now, miss?
Will you still come back for me?</i>

7
00:00:46,246 --> 00:00:47,781
Or have you completely forgotten me?

8
00:00:47,847 --> 00:00:50,250
<i>Don't make a wrong move!</i>
<i>Show me your cedula!</i>

9
00:00:52,919 --> 00:00:54,020
<i>Not my friend!</i>

10
00:00:56,856 --> 00:01:00,293
I was only gone for a while, my friend,
yet you caused trouble again.

11
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,195
<i>Am I finally in</i> El Fili<i>?</i>

12
00:01:02,262 --> 00:01:04,664
<i>I think I am.</i>

13
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:06,533
<i>The Saint Claire Monastery?</i>

14
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:08,635
According to the novel,
she's supposed to be here.

15
00:01:08,701 --> 00:01:10,203
Maria Clara!

16
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:11,838
<i>Don't lose hope!</i>

17
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:14,641
Just like in the soap operas I've seen,

18
00:01:23,683 --> 00:01:27,420
<i>Captain Tiago,</i>
<i>I need to speak with Maria Clara.</i>

19
00:01:27,487 --> 00:01:29,255
Let's save your daughter.

20
00:01:29,322 --> 00:01:30,790
I don't have a daughter!

21
00:01:30,857 --> 00:01:34,427
She's gone!

22
00:01:34,494 --> 00:01:37,297
<i>A woman came looking</i>
<i>for Maria earlier, Father.</i>

23
00:01:37,363 --> 00:01:41,134
<i>Just like the Captain General's friend,
Señor Simoun.</i>

24
00:01:41,201 --> 00:01:43,336
Klay? Where are you now?

25
00:01:43,403 --> 00:01:44,537
<i>Oh, come on.</i>

26
00:01:45,038 --> 00:01:48,508
Everything reminds me of Fidel.

27
00:01:48,575 --> 00:01:50,577
PREVIOUSLY

28
00:02:16,035 --> 00:02:17,437
It's true, Maria.

29
00:02:18,071 --> 00:02:19,906
There's now a steamer named Tabo.

30
00:02:21,107 --> 00:02:23,076
Its route is from Laguna going to…

31
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:25,712
other…

32
00:02:32,886 --> 00:02:35,121
You seem to have lost weight.

33
00:02:40,093 --> 00:02:42,695
Compared to the last time I visited you.

34
00:02:43,963 --> 00:02:47,333
That was only last month, wasn't it?

35
00:02:56,976 --> 00:02:57,944
Maria…

36
00:03:00,446 --> 00:03:01,748
I'm sorry.

37
00:03:02,649 --> 00:03:04,350
I'm very sorry.

38
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:07,654
You don't…

39
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:12,025
you don't have to be scared of me anymore,

40
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,962
for I have proven

41
00:03:17,063 --> 00:03:18,665
in the past years

42
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:26,172
that I deeply regret my moment of madness,

43
00:03:28,841 --> 00:03:31,010
or evil's temptation.

44
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:34,614
Maria,

45
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:36,883
believe me.

46
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:41,154
I will never hurt you again.

47
00:03:43,022 --> 00:03:44,090
Because…

48
00:03:45,758 --> 00:03:47,093
I truly…

49
00:03:48,261 --> 00:03:49,862
love you.

50
00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:59,806
Don't speak of things
a nun shouldn't hear, Friar.

51
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:10,116
Have some shame
in the presence of the Lord.

52
00:04:11,784 --> 00:04:15,855
Especially since I'm here to be pious

53
00:04:16,723 --> 00:04:19,359
and to cleanse us all

54
00:04:21,628 --> 00:04:22,895
of our sins.

55
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:47,220
Martina?

56
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:50,556
Take a break. Here are some biscuits.

57
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:57,930
You're so kind, Sister.

58
00:04:57,997 --> 00:04:59,432
Thank you.

59
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:07,940
Thank you.

60
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:24,257
Martina?

61
00:05:26,025 --> 00:05:29,595
Do you know anything
about the woman looking for me earlier?

62
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:40,006
Sister Teresa will get mad
at me if I tell you.

63
00:05:54,253 --> 00:05:55,254
Martina.

64
00:05:56,255 --> 00:05:57,156
Thank you.

65
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:04,163
In all the years that we've
been together in this monastery…

66
00:06:06,299 --> 00:06:09,268
Did I ever treat you badly?

67
00:06:15,942 --> 00:06:17,009
No.

68
00:06:19,078 --> 00:06:24,384
You, sister, are one of the reasons
why I decided to stay here and serve.

69
00:06:25,685 --> 00:06:29,822
You've been so kind to me
and the other servants here.

70
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:32,625
You treat us fairly.

71
00:06:37,663 --> 00:06:40,700
I banished the woman
looking for you earlier.

72
00:06:40,767 --> 00:06:43,369
Sister Teresa was getting annoyed with her

73
00:06:43,436 --> 00:06:47,306
because she's being hysterical
and starting to cause a disturbance.

74
00:06:49,475 --> 00:06:51,477
And what's that woman's name?

75
00:06:53,713 --> 00:06:56,315
Sister called her…

76
00:06:56,849 --> 00:06:58,584
Ms. Klay?

77
00:07:09,328 --> 00:07:10,696
So it's true.

78
00:07:13,566 --> 00:07:17,937
Everything I heard earlier is true
and not just a figment of my imagination.

79
00:07:21,741 --> 00:07:27,480
It was my best friend shouting
outside the monastery earlier.

80
00:07:31,417 --> 00:07:32,685
Thank God.

81
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:36,589
Despite many years having passed,
she still remembers me.

82
00:07:45,031 --> 00:07:49,335
But what do the words
she spoke in English mean?

83
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:24,804
Maria…

84
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:29,942
If you'll just peek out the window,

85
00:08:32,478 --> 00:08:35,081
then it would bring me so much happiness

86
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:37,817
to see you again.

87
00:09:07,513 --> 00:09:08,414
Señor,

88
00:09:09,282 --> 00:09:14,687
excuse me, but the ship is about to leave.

89
00:09:14,754 --> 00:09:16,756
We have to go now.

90
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:52,858
I missed this.

91
00:10:23,189 --> 00:10:25,024
Sister, excuse me.

92
00:10:27,393 --> 00:10:28,561
Good afternoon.

93
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:30,463
Good afternoon, miss.

94
00:10:30,529 --> 00:10:32,064
How can I help you?

95
00:10:35,835 --> 00:10:38,504
There's something I wanted to ask you.

96
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:41,307
You understand…

97
00:10:42,274 --> 00:10:43,909
English, don't you?

98
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:50,916
Because my grandfather
was an Englishman who migrated

99
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:54,387
to New York City in America.

100
00:10:55,888 --> 00:10:57,123
Thank God.

101
00:10:57,757 --> 00:11:00,493
Then you can help me, sister.

102
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:03,863
I have something to ask you.

103
00:11:03,929 --> 00:11:05,231
What do these words mean?

104
00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:18,577
Yes!

105
00:11:18,644 --> 00:11:19,578
Yes, sister.

106
00:11:20,379 --> 00:11:21,414
And…

107
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:33,526
What does that mean, sister?

108
00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:54,613
Well then,

109
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:57,516
"he" refers to a man.

110
00:12:01,921 --> 00:12:03,923
It means he's alive.

111
00:12:03,989 --> 00:12:05,357
He's not dead.

112
00:12:08,527 --> 00:12:10,162
It means he has returned.

113
00:12:10,963 --> 00:12:12,431
The man is back?

114
00:12:12,498 --> 00:12:13,566
He's back?

115
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:17,069
But I don't understand, Maria.

116
00:12:17,136 --> 00:12:21,640
Who is this man
who's not dead and has returned?

117
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:30,282
But if it's true that Crisostomo is alive,

118
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:31,851
he will come back for me.

119
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:33,052
I don't know.

120
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:35,254
But I believe

121
00:12:35,321 --> 00:12:37,723
that he'll be back.
He'll come back for you.

122
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:40,693
I need to stay in the convent for now.

123
00:12:41,694 --> 00:12:43,863
I might just wait for him there.

124
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:45,898
I might even wait for nothing.

125
00:12:49,034 --> 00:12:50,736
Are you alright, Maria?

126
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:58,344
I was just surprised
by what you said, sister.

127
00:12:59,478 --> 00:13:02,915
I've been waiting for nothing for so long.

128
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:10,589
I thought that death
is the only way for us to reunite.

129
00:13:13,058 --> 00:13:16,495
Forgive me, Maria,
but what are you saying?

130
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:20,299
Nothing. Nothing, sister.

131
00:13:20,366 --> 00:13:23,369
Well then, I'll go ahead.

132
00:14:01,941 --> 00:14:05,778
I'm still wondering
who could've given us all these weapons.

133
00:14:08,614 --> 00:14:12,151
Since many are experiencing
cruelty from foreign invaders,

134
00:14:12,218 --> 00:14:15,387
we can expect help from many.

135
00:14:16,989 --> 00:14:19,325
If Crisostomo is here with us,

136
00:14:20,092 --> 00:14:24,463
I'm sure he'll provide
the biggest contribution to this cause.

137
00:14:26,332 --> 00:14:27,666
Wherever he is now.

138
00:14:29,001 --> 00:14:30,836
I'm sure he has
completely forgotten about us.

139
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:34,573
It's better for us
to think that he's dead.

140
00:14:42,014 --> 00:14:43,349
We're doomed.

141
00:14:43,415 --> 00:14:44,617
The vultures are here.

142
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:51,257
Good afternoon, misters.

143
00:14:52,124 --> 00:14:54,059
What can we do for you?

144
00:14:55,761 --> 00:15:00,532
We need to check everyone
who comes and leaves this place.

145
00:15:02,334 --> 00:15:06,305
Two civil guards were
found dead near the area this morning.

146
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:09,608
And we think…

147
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:13,512
they were killed by the bandits!

148
00:15:33,165 --> 00:15:34,366
Señor…

149
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,435
This is for you.

150
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:41,607
My younger brother and I are in a hurry

151
00:15:42,408 --> 00:15:45,344
because we need
to rush to our sick mother.

152
00:15:45,911 --> 00:15:49,715
Unfortunately, we left our cedulas.

153
00:15:53,585 --> 00:15:54,687
Forgive us.

154
00:15:59,425 --> 00:16:00,426
Let's go.

155
00:16:37,763 --> 00:16:38,831
<i>Lord Jesus…</i>

156
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:42,267
<i>I know it's impossible,</i>

157
00:16:43,302 --> 00:16:46,138
<i>but I hope that the man</i>
<i>Klay said who's still alive</i>

158
00:16:46,205 --> 00:16:47,306
<i>is indeed Crisostomo.</i>

159
00:16:49,141 --> 00:16:50,976
<i>I hope so, beloved Lord.</i>

160
00:16:52,044 --> 00:16:53,979
<i>I hope they're both true.</i>

161
00:16:55,581 --> 00:16:56,982
<i>I can still bear it all.</i>

162
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:01,653
<i>I'll continue to endure everything</i>

163
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:06,325
<i>if it means that
You'll grace me with happiness and hope.</i>

164
00:17:21,073 --> 00:17:22,307
Look for Lingyun.

165
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:26,245
And ask his help
to load my things onto the boat.

166
00:17:26,311 --> 00:17:27,413
Yes, señor.

167
00:17:45,798 --> 00:17:48,534
-Señor Simoun!
-Señor Quiroga!

168
00:17:49,301 --> 00:17:50,636
How are you, señor?

169
00:17:52,371 --> 00:17:55,874
Were our instruments already claimed?

170
00:17:56,508 --> 00:17:58,377
Claimed by two men.

171
00:17:58,444 --> 00:18:02,414
One of them is a hardened criminal.
Spaniards called him The Devil,

172
00:18:02,481 --> 00:18:05,084
but he's known as The Judge.

173
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:09,922
The other one is a Chinese man
known as The Enlightened.

174
00:18:13,826 --> 00:18:17,262
The Judge and The Enlightened.

175
00:18:21,834 --> 00:18:24,670
Are they the leaders of the revolution?

176
00:18:24,736 --> 00:18:25,671
Yes, señor.

177
00:18:25,737 --> 00:18:27,072
Ah, they are the…

178
00:18:28,574 --> 00:18:30,809
The Revolutionaries.

179
00:18:34,246 --> 00:18:38,283
They recognize one of my workers.

180
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:42,454
And they're asking me who you are.

181
00:18:43,021 --> 00:18:45,657
Of course, I didn't tell them.

182
00:18:49,228 --> 00:18:51,063
Well done, Quiroga.

183
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:57,202
No one should know that I support them.

184
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,174
Well then,

185
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:05,444
thank you very much for all your help.

186
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:09,982
And if you need anything from the
Captain General for your business,

187
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:13,886
I'll make sure you get it right away.

188
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:15,854
Thank you, señor.

189
00:19:16,355 --> 00:19:18,590
I won't bother you any longer.

190
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:21,960
Until we meet again, my friend.

191
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:41,513
What should I do?

192
00:19:42,214 --> 00:19:43,982
Should I go back to the monastery?

193
00:19:45,384 --> 00:19:47,686
They'll surely kick me out of there.

194
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:52,691
Sir.

195
00:19:52,758 --> 00:19:55,360
I must talk to him.

196
00:19:57,663 --> 00:19:59,998
But where can I find him?

197
00:20:17,983 --> 00:20:21,420
I hope you have
the answer to his whereabouts,

198
00:20:21,486 --> 00:20:23,288
alias Señor Simoun.

199
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:37,803
This is my second time
reading this. This is too much.

200
00:20:45,711 --> 00:20:47,546
"One", okay.

201
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:50,315
"On the Upper Deck".

202
00:20:51,016 --> 00:20:56,521
"Inside the steamer called Tabo
ferrying passengers to Laguna

203
00:20:57,389 --> 00:21:02,594
are two decks,
the upper deck and the lower deck."

204
00:21:04,329 --> 00:21:11,069
<i>Inside the round boat
are powerful and rich passengers.</i>

205
00:21:33,091 --> 00:21:35,527
What chapter is this?
Is this the first chapter?

206
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:40,999
Though they're already aboard the steamer

207
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:46,004
going to Laguna and San Diego.

208
00:21:51,843 --> 00:21:53,979
I wonder if Fidel is still in San Diego.

209
00:21:57,516 --> 00:22:00,485
Whatever! I need to find them.

210
00:22:01,787 --> 00:22:06,158
Because needless to say,
the three of us will save Maria Clara.

211
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:08,427
Right.

212
00:22:19,938 --> 00:22:20,772
Halt?

213
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:22,107
Halt!

214
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:31,249
Can I hitch a ride?

215
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:36,388
-Where are you headed to, miss?
-Just nearby.

216
00:22:37,789 --> 00:22:38,924
To Laguna.

217
00:22:40,258 --> 00:22:41,793
Laguna?

218
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,228
My goodness!

219
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:44,830
Señora.

220
00:22:45,797 --> 00:22:47,366
That's too far.

221
00:22:50,435 --> 00:22:51,370
But you're lucky.

222
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:55,040
You're lucky because
that's where I'm heading too.

223
00:22:55,941 --> 00:22:58,744
But you have to endure the ride.

224
00:22:59,778 --> 00:23:01,913
I have food cargo with me.

225
00:23:02,414 --> 00:23:04,216
No problem, mister!

226
00:23:04,282 --> 00:23:05,650
Let's go to Laguna!

227
00:23:07,419 --> 00:23:08,520
Thank you.

228
00:23:12,824 --> 00:23:14,025
-Thank you.
-All good?

229
00:23:21,032 --> 00:23:22,167
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

230
00:23:36,381 --> 00:23:42,387
Oh, Don Custodio,
I don't know where my husband is,

231
00:23:42,454 --> 00:23:46,191
and I don't have any idea
why he suddenly disappeared.

232
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:49,661
So here I am, traveling alone,

233
00:23:49,728 --> 00:23:54,366
because I want to go
to Laguna to look for him.

234
00:24:00,972 --> 00:24:05,477
It seems that our trip will take a while,

235
00:24:05,544 --> 00:24:09,481
for there are many boats and fishing nets

236
00:24:09,548 --> 00:24:13,151
blocking our ship's way.

237
00:24:13,852 --> 00:24:18,657
Those natives are slowing down our trip,

238
00:24:18,723 --> 00:24:21,960
most especially the Philippines' progress.

239
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:26,698
It's not the natives.
The river is our problem.

240
00:24:28,366 --> 00:24:34,439
The solution to that problem is simple.

241
00:24:39,711 --> 00:24:41,012
Logic…

242
00:24:43,415 --> 00:24:48,153
is necessary to solve the problem.

243
00:24:59,397 --> 00:25:00,632
And who is the gentleman…

244
00:25:02,133 --> 00:25:05,337
that intruded on our conversation?

245
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:08,206
Finally!

246
00:25:10,709 --> 00:25:14,880
I'm glad to meet you, Señor Simoun.

247
00:25:19,451 --> 00:25:21,286
The Brown Cardinal.

248
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:23,588
The Black Eminence.

249
00:25:26,324 --> 00:25:29,427
So you're the famous jeweler

250
00:25:30,262 --> 00:25:31,329
who is…

251
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:35,267
a good friend of the Captain General?

252
00:25:35,834 --> 00:25:37,135
Yes, that's me, Father.

253
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:43,041
I'm glad to meet you all,

254
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:48,747
especially the friar who I heard

255
00:25:48,813 --> 00:25:52,751
is the holiest of all the friars

256
00:25:52,817 --> 00:25:55,554
in the whole Philippines.

257
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:01,159
A favor, Sister Maria?

258
00:26:02,527 --> 00:26:03,395
Yes, Martina.

259
00:26:04,696 --> 00:26:09,935
A huge request that I will owe you
once you've granted this.

260
00:26:10,702 --> 00:26:13,004
Sure, what's your request?

261
00:26:14,005 --> 00:26:18,243
If in case Ms. Klay
returns to the monastery,

262
00:26:18,843 --> 00:26:23,982
I ask you to please do something
for us to meet and talk again.

263
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:29,054
But sister, I'm certain that
the friars will punish me if--

264
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:34,326
if they find out
that I violated the-- the…

265
00:26:34,392 --> 00:26:37,095
Martina.

266
00:26:37,162 --> 00:26:40,065
Martina, please. I'm begging you.

267
00:26:41,032 --> 00:26:43,668
I'm begging you, please grant my request.

268
00:26:49,674 --> 00:26:52,043
You know that I'll eventually give in.

269
00:26:55,714 --> 00:26:56,815
Yes, sister.

270
00:26:57,916 --> 00:26:59,217
You can count on it.

271
00:27:00,652 --> 00:27:05,490
I'm still fortunate enough
to have friends like you.

272
00:27:08,426 --> 00:27:09,894
Thank you very much, Martina.

273
00:27:16,901 --> 00:27:20,372
Let's talk about the suggestion
that you proposed earlier,

274
00:27:20,939 --> 00:27:22,240
Señor Simoun.

275
00:27:23,608 --> 00:27:25,877
Ah, yes!

276
00:27:26,911 --> 00:27:29,714
This country's navigation will improve

277
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:34,886
if we excavate the mouth
of the river going to Manila.

278
00:27:35,887 --> 00:27:37,956
And the excavated soil
will be dumped into the river

279
00:27:38,023 --> 00:27:41,893
and if the river is gone,
traveling will be easier.

280
00:27:42,894 --> 00:27:46,064
Ah, that's a great idea!

281
00:27:47,866 --> 00:27:50,802
But a huge amount
of money is needed for that.

282
00:27:50,869 --> 00:27:54,739
Who will pay for it,
and how will we pay the laborers?

283
00:27:56,808 --> 00:27:59,711
We don't need to pay the natives,

284
00:27:59,778 --> 00:28:02,847
especially if we assign
the prisoners as laborers.

285
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:08,053
And it would be better
if the government imposes forced labor

286
00:28:09,054 --> 00:28:12,590
on men aged 16 to 60.

287
00:28:14,759 --> 00:28:18,329
<i>It's their obligation
to work with the government</i>

288
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:21,166
<i>to improve this country,</i>

289
00:28:22,567 --> 00:28:25,336
<i>that's why we don't need to pay them.</i>

290
00:28:27,739 --> 00:28:34,312
<i>And whoever opposes
forced labor should be punished.</i>

291
00:28:38,983 --> 00:28:41,986
Violent, yes, I'm aware.

292
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:46,291
But the benefit we'll gain
from forced labor

293
00:28:47,358 --> 00:28:50,361
is the instant progress of this country.

294
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:53,431
Apologies, señor.

295
00:28:54,165 --> 00:28:57,135
But the natives will certainly revolt.

296
00:28:57,202 --> 00:29:01,973
Yes, especially since they
don't owe a debt of gratitude to Spain.

297
00:29:04,709 --> 00:29:06,377
<i>They all revolted.</i>

298
00:29:06,444 --> 00:29:07,445
Hey!

299
00:29:08,713 --> 00:29:09,748
Where are you going?

300
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:40,812
<i>And until now, in every town…</i>

301
00:29:40,879 --> 00:29:42,814
Enlightened, Judge, let's go!

302
00:29:43,414 --> 00:29:44,549
Let's go!

303
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:47,752
<i>They're still fighting against Spain.</i>

304
00:29:47,819 --> 00:29:50,855
<i>Those scoundrels Indio!</i>

305
00:29:50,922 --> 00:29:54,058
That's why they can never be trusted!

306
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:59,264
Don't ever trust them. Traitors!

307
00:30:00,064 --> 00:30:03,101
They will never defeat Spain,

308
00:30:04,102 --> 00:30:07,839
so we shouldn't be afraid
of their useless revolt.

309
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:11,009
All right, I'll go ahead.

310
00:30:14,112 --> 00:30:17,115
It was nice talking
to all of you even for a short while.

311
00:30:17,882 --> 00:30:19,951
An admirable gentleman!

312
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:23,521
Goodbye.

313
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:28,259
One moment, Señor Simoun.

314
00:30:30,261 --> 00:30:31,663
What is it, Father?

315
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:39,137
I just remembered, someone told me
that you'd visited the monastery,

316
00:30:40,605 --> 00:30:43,174
to speak with a nun.

317
00:30:44,209 --> 00:30:49,714
As Maria Clara's guardian
and the chaplain of that monastery,

318
00:30:51,049 --> 00:30:56,554
may I know why you wanted to go there

319
00:30:57,121 --> 00:30:58,456
and speak with her?

320
00:31:07,665 --> 00:31:13,504
Miss, sorry if we had to change
carriages at the town we passed by.

321
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:16,641
It's all right, mister.

322
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:18,977
But if I may ask, why did you
have to exchange carriages

323
00:31:19,043 --> 00:31:20,345
with the other coachman?

324
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,681
To confuse the enemy.

325
00:31:23,748 --> 00:31:26,417
-The what?
-Oh, nothing!

326
00:31:28,486 --> 00:31:32,023
Mister, are the tulisanes
still rampant today?

327
00:31:32,857 --> 00:31:33,958
Tulisanes.

328
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:36,327
Yes, of course.

329
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:38,730
And their numbers are increasing.

330
00:31:40,031 --> 00:31:43,401
But miss, they aren't bandits at all.

331
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:49,107
Spaniards just tagged them
as such for us to fear them.

332
00:31:50,275 --> 00:31:51,409
But the truth is,

333
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:56,247
they want to free
the country from the invaders.

334
00:31:58,182 --> 00:31:59,517
They are revolutionaries.

335
00:32:00,151 --> 00:32:01,686
That's what I hear them being called.

336
00:32:03,154 --> 00:32:04,589
You got it right, mister!

337
00:32:05,156 --> 00:32:06,424
Actually--

338
00:32:07,458 --> 00:32:08,993
but don't report me, okay?

339
00:32:10,561 --> 00:32:13,765
But I once had friends
with some tulisanes.

340
00:32:14,899 --> 00:32:18,036
I no longer wish
to go back to my old life, miss.

341
00:32:18,102 --> 00:32:19,337
Come with me.

342
00:32:19,404 --> 00:32:23,441
Together, we will continue
what Crisostomo and Elias have started.

343
00:32:25,743 --> 00:32:27,045
I wonder how he's doing.

344
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:29,881
Did he keep his word?

345
00:32:36,154 --> 00:32:37,021
Miss…

346
00:32:38,523 --> 00:32:39,691
Good afternoon!

347
00:32:40,525 --> 00:32:42,026
Show us your cedulas.

348
00:32:43,394 --> 00:32:44,462
One moment, please.

349
00:32:59,277 --> 00:33:01,446
Miss, show us your cedula.

350
00:33:03,247 --> 00:33:04,615
One moment, please.

351
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:09,454
I should've gotten one from
the City Hall before coming back here.

352
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:14,659
Oh no, señores!

353
00:33:14,726 --> 00:33:19,197
Apologies, I forgot mine at home.

354
00:33:19,263 --> 00:33:23,101
But-- but… Here!
There you go. That should do.

355
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:24,202
There.

356
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:29,140
You can't be here without your cedula.
Everyone knows the consequences.

357
00:33:29,207 --> 00:33:30,875
Why? What will happen to me?

358
00:33:30,942 --> 00:33:34,212
-Get down from there and come with us.
-Where will you take me?

359
00:33:34,278 --> 00:33:37,682
You must show us your cedula,
or else you'll be imprisoned.

360
00:33:37,749 --> 00:33:38,850
Imprisoned?

361
00:33:41,719 --> 00:33:44,422
Señores, please forgive me.

362
00:33:44,489 --> 00:33:48,426
Don't worry,
I won't forget to bring it next time.

363
00:33:48,493 --> 00:33:51,129
That won't do.
You must be brought to the barracks.

364
00:33:51,195 --> 00:33:53,297
-Come on, get down!
-Wait, wait, please!

365
00:34:00,738 --> 00:34:02,673
Oh, my God.

366
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:06,711
Let's go.

367
00:34:09,847 --> 00:34:12,083
-Where are we going? There?
-Let's go! To the barracks!

368
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:14,452
-He's not coming with us?
-Come with us. Let's go!

369
00:34:23,294 --> 00:34:25,163
I'm just curious,

370
00:34:26,197 --> 00:34:27,298
Señor Simoun.

371
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:32,970
What would a jeweler
like you possibly need

372
00:34:33,971 --> 00:34:36,974
-from a nun--
-Curiosity, Father.

373
00:34:37,708 --> 00:34:38,910
Curiosity?

374
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:43,181
-What?
-Yes, curiosity.

375
00:34:44,715 --> 00:34:46,150
Because of curiosity.

376
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:49,754
I met someone from San Diego

377
00:34:50,888 --> 00:34:54,258
who told me the story
of an unfortunate nun.

378
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:58,162
He also told me that she's very beautiful,

379
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:04,035
that's why my curiosity
led me to visit her, but…

380
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:09,006
I wasn't permitted by one
of the sisters, so I didn't insist.

381
00:35:11,409 --> 00:35:14,212
Well then, I must go now.

382
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:19,217
I still need to check on
my servants on the lower deck.

383
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:44,509
We heard that
the Captain General is in Laguna too,

384
00:35:45,243 --> 00:35:50,148
so we sent him
a petition to build a school

385
00:35:50,214 --> 00:35:53,618
that will teach Spanish to our countrymen.

386
00:35:54,785 --> 00:35:58,723
Like you, someone tried
to build a school before.

387
00:36:00,424 --> 00:36:03,161
But I'm sure you're aware
of what happened to him.

388
00:36:04,228 --> 00:36:08,499
He was shot and killed
by the civil guards, right?

389
00:36:09,634 --> 00:36:10,835
So you know.

390
00:36:11,536 --> 00:36:13,871
Then why do you still
want to build a school?

391
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:18,309
Do you want to end up like Señor Ibarra?

392
00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:21,012
May he rest in peace.

393
00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:30,721
Let's not talk about
the deceased enemy of the state.

394
00:36:30,788 --> 00:36:34,258
The foreign ally
of the government is here.

395
00:36:34,325 --> 00:36:36,427
Are you doing all right here?

396
00:36:36,494 --> 00:36:39,263
Yes, mister. Thank you.

397
00:36:45,469 --> 00:36:48,906
Señor Simoun, good afternoon.

398
00:36:48,973 --> 00:36:51,943
I'm Captain Basilio from San Diego.

399
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:56,113
We met when the Captain General

400
00:36:56,180 --> 00:37:00,351
gathered all the governors
and leaders of every town.

401
00:37:03,187 --> 00:37:04,822
The rich captain…

402
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:08,059
who leads a town but…

403
00:37:10,595 --> 00:37:14,398
doesn't have any means to buy my jewelry.

404
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:17,702
Excuse me, señor.

405
00:37:18,869 --> 00:37:23,374
But, no matter where you go
in the Philippines,

406
00:37:23,441 --> 00:37:25,443
not everyone can afford to buy jewels

407
00:37:25,509 --> 00:37:27,311
because we don't need them.

408
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:31,449
Don't be offended, young man!

409
00:37:32,883 --> 00:37:34,485
Because someone told me

410
00:37:34,552 --> 00:37:39,657
that all the riches of San Diego
are in the hands of the friars.

411
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:44,629
And you, Father?

412
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:47,398
Why are you here?

413
00:37:48,532 --> 00:37:50,635
Why don't you go to the upper deck

414
00:37:50,701 --> 00:37:52,336
where your eminence…

415
00:37:53,571 --> 00:37:54,472
belongs?

416
00:37:55,606 --> 00:37:59,310
Because my uncle
isn't self-conceited like others,

417
00:38:00,177 --> 00:38:03,447
who think of themselves
as Gods who descended from heaven.

418
00:38:06,484 --> 00:38:07,852
Apologies, señor.

419
00:38:09,987 --> 00:38:13,024
-Apologize now, Isagani.
-No need, Father.

420
00:38:14,525 --> 00:38:16,127
I wasn't offended.

421
00:38:17,862 --> 00:38:19,096
In fact,

422
00:38:19,864 --> 00:38:22,767
I'm happy to talk
to young people like him.

423
00:38:25,169 --> 00:38:26,604
Let's go to the upper deck.

424
00:38:27,538 --> 00:38:32,009
And if the friar will allow us,
then we shall drink beer.

425
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:37,648
Thank you for the offer, señor,
but we don't drink beer.

426
00:38:38,249 --> 00:38:40,751
Water is fine for me and Basilio.

427
00:38:50,094 --> 00:38:53,731
Are you also from Laguna, young man?

428
00:38:56,033 --> 00:38:58,936
Yes. From San Diego, señor.

429
00:38:59,804 --> 00:39:01,572
I was born there,

430
00:39:01,639 --> 00:39:05,876
and served as a sacristan
in our parish when I was a kid.

431
00:39:06,711 --> 00:39:09,213
<i>I'll leave being a sacristan</i>

432
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:12,817
<i>to shepherd your cows</i>
<i>and carabaos instead.</i>

433
00:39:12,883 --> 00:39:15,586
It's my dream to serve a good señor.

434
00:39:15,653 --> 00:39:18,723
<i>May this help you start a new life.</i>

435
00:39:18,789 --> 00:39:21,859
<i>When we arrive in Manila,
we will go our separate ways.</i>

436
00:39:21,926 --> 00:39:25,863
<i>You may go to Binondo,
to the house of the de los Santos.</i>

437
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:28,132
<i>Captain Tiago's house in Manila?</i>

438
00:39:29,834 --> 00:39:33,037
It's my pleasure to meet you, señor.

439
00:39:51,989 --> 00:39:54,592
Let me go! Ouch, it hurts!

440
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:00,398
Get in.

441
00:40:00,965 --> 00:40:02,833
Hey, wait! What about my things?

442
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:06,170
You can't have your things
inside the cell. Just get in!

443
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:08,706
Don't go through my stuff!
Don't go through it!

444
00:40:08,773 --> 00:40:12,743
This needs to be done
to see if you're dangerous to this town,

445
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:14,545
especially since you don't have a cedula.

446
00:40:14,612 --> 00:40:17,915
Well then, where are you from?
And what is your full name?

447
00:40:17,982 --> 00:40:21,419
Ah, excuse me, but you already have my ID.

448
00:40:21,485 --> 00:40:25,122
Everything is written there.
Just read it. It's like a cedula.

449
00:40:25,189 --> 00:40:27,958
"University of the City of Manila".

450
00:40:28,025 --> 00:40:30,561
"Maria Clara Infantes".

451
00:40:30,628 --> 00:40:31,762
"Klay"?

452
00:40:31,829 --> 00:40:33,531
This thing seems strange.

453
00:40:35,966 --> 00:40:38,169
And the things
in her bag are strange, too.

454
00:40:38,736 --> 00:40:41,572
Hey! Not that!
Not that one! That's my book!

455
00:40:41,639 --> 00:40:43,207
Put it back inside my bag.

456
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:46,177
Don't touch that.
That's mine. That's important!

457
00:40:46,243 --> 00:40:48,913
It's not written here where you are from.

458
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:50,581
I'm from San Diego.

459
00:40:51,682 --> 00:40:53,284
I live with my relatives.

460
00:40:53,884 --> 00:40:56,954
Maria Clara de los Santos y Alba,

461
00:40:58,589 --> 00:41:00,391
Captain Tiago's daughter.

462
00:41:03,561 --> 00:41:05,496
You're surprised by my connections, right?

463
00:41:05,563 --> 00:41:07,064
Not only that.

464
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:12,036
I'm also a close friend
of the wealthy jeweler,

465
00:41:12,837 --> 00:41:13,971
Señor Simoun.

466
00:41:15,439 --> 00:41:17,408
The Brown Cardinal.

467
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:21,679
So you better let me go
if you don't want to upset him.

468
00:41:21,745 --> 00:41:23,113
Really?

469
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:24,782
Is he your friend?

470
00:41:24,849 --> 00:41:28,319
Or you're just using his name
to escape from this punishment?

471
00:41:28,385 --> 00:41:29,720
What?

472
00:41:29,787 --> 00:41:31,655
If you want, ask him to come here.

473
00:41:33,791 --> 00:41:36,727
That's right!
That would also solve my problem.

474
00:41:38,529 --> 00:41:39,530
Right!

475
00:41:40,264 --> 00:41:43,133
Ask Señor Simoun to come here.

476
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:46,537
Tell him that Ms. Klay is here.

477
00:41:47,238 --> 00:41:49,006
He'll know who I am.

478
00:41:49,073 --> 00:41:53,544
Move now. Tell him to come here
so you'd know that I'm not lying.

479
00:41:55,112 --> 00:41:58,015
We'll find out
if you're telling the truth.

480
00:41:59,650 --> 00:42:02,186
Follow me, I have something for you to do.

481
00:42:11,295 --> 00:42:12,730
I hope they'll be able to reach Sir,

482
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:16,133
so we'll see each other soon.

483
00:42:24,575 --> 00:42:27,811
May I know what you do
for a living, young man?

484
00:42:30,781 --> 00:42:34,351
Basilio will soon graduate
with a degree in medicine

485
00:42:34,418 --> 00:42:36,387
and with the highest mark.

486
00:42:37,821 --> 00:42:41,058
That's why the people
of San Diego are proud of him.

487
00:42:42,126 --> 00:42:46,397
Proof that not all people in San Diego
are poor and worthless, señor.

488
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:51,201
I owe everything
to Captain Tiago, Father, Captain,

489
00:42:52,469 --> 00:42:54,638
who took me in when I was orphaned

490
00:42:55,706 --> 00:42:58,442
and allowed me to study.

491
00:43:11,055 --> 00:43:16,193
Apologies, señor,
but did you just speak in English?

492
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:19,863
Ah, don't mind it.

493
00:43:21,198 --> 00:43:22,166
Well then,

494
00:43:23,167 --> 00:43:24,535
I'll go ahead.

495
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:36,113
The arrogant foreigner speaks English!

496
00:43:38,415 --> 00:43:39,550
Don't be surprised.

497
00:43:40,050 --> 00:43:45,956
People say that he came
from Latin America.

498
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:50,494
Or maybe he came from hell, Uncle?

499
00:43:51,061 --> 00:43:54,098
Isagani, what's the matter with you?

500
00:43:54,164 --> 00:43:56,900
Why do you seem furious at that person?

501
00:43:57,534 --> 00:44:01,605
I don't know, but I have
a bad feeling about him.

502
00:44:02,139 --> 00:44:05,643
Don't you know that he's known
as the Brown Cardinal,

503
00:44:05,709 --> 00:44:11,482
because the Captain General listens
and follows everything that he says?

504
00:44:12,950 --> 00:44:15,653
It was your chance to ask for his help

505
00:44:15,719 --> 00:44:17,688
with the school you want to build.

506
00:44:19,690 --> 00:44:21,258
See, Isagani?

507
00:44:22,092 --> 00:44:23,560
We wasted our chance!

508
00:44:23,627 --> 00:44:27,164
That's what I always tell my nephew.

509
00:44:28,098 --> 00:44:31,702
To always think first before
doing and saying something.

510
00:44:32,469 --> 00:44:34,371
He always acts hastily.

511
00:44:35,873 --> 00:44:39,410
Come with me. Let's get
my medicines from my belongings.

512
00:44:40,444 --> 00:44:41,712
I'll be after you, Uncle.

513
00:44:42,546 --> 00:44:43,914
But to be honest, Captain…

514
00:44:45,049 --> 00:44:46,650
Isagani has a point.

515
00:44:47,918 --> 00:44:51,355
There's something
strange about Señor Simoun

516
00:44:52,289 --> 00:44:53,657
that I can't even explain.

517
00:44:57,628 --> 00:45:01,965
We should've taken our chance
when he embraced you earlier, friend.

518
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:05,502
Is that how greetings usually go
in Latin America?

519
00:45:09,306 --> 00:45:11,075
We all don't know him.

520
00:45:12,209 --> 00:45:14,311
So who are we to judge?

521
00:45:55,586 --> 00:45:57,788
And why didn't you go straight to Tiani?

522
00:46:00,624 --> 00:46:02,960
Now I know why you were
in a hurry to leave the dock earlier.

523
00:46:03,961 --> 00:46:06,530
It's because you planned
to watch Paulita from here.

524
00:46:14,104 --> 00:46:15,439
Stop teasing me.

525
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:19,476
What about you? When are you
going to get a glimpse of your beloved?

526
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:23,580
Tomorrow, it's my turn
to go straight to Tiani.

527
00:46:26,550 --> 00:46:28,018
Oh, Basilio.

528
00:46:29,052 --> 00:46:31,288
Why did you arrive just now and…

529
00:46:31,355 --> 00:46:33,490
where's the coachman who fetched you?

530
00:46:34,158 --> 00:46:35,259
Unfortunately,

531
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:38,295
he was arrested by the civil guards.

532
00:46:39,530 --> 00:46:40,631
They even beat him up.

533
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:46,703
He didn't bring his cedula.
I had to find a way to set him free.

534
00:46:49,773 --> 00:46:50,774
Why didn't he bring it?

535
00:46:52,075 --> 00:46:55,479
He's aware that nobody should
leave the house without their cedula

536
00:46:55,546 --> 00:46:57,080
because those…

537
00:46:58,215 --> 00:46:59,716
damn civil guards are very strict.

538
00:47:00,918 --> 00:47:01,985
I don't know either.

539
00:47:06,657 --> 00:47:07,891
Hey!

540
00:47:07,958 --> 00:47:09,326
Señor!

541
00:47:09,927 --> 00:47:12,162
Have you seen my husband?

542
00:47:12,796 --> 00:47:16,133
He's been missing for so long
and I don't know where he is.

543
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:19,469
My servants said that he hasn't
been home for a long time now.

544
00:47:20,838 --> 00:47:24,041
No, señora.
I don't know anything. Forgive me.

545
00:47:25,042 --> 00:47:26,476
You're useless.

546
00:47:27,511 --> 00:47:28,979
Auntie, please.

547
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:31,715
Don't curse at people.

548
00:47:32,449 --> 00:47:33,584
It's embarrassing.

549
00:47:34,651 --> 00:47:36,086
Why would I be embarrassed?

550
00:47:41,058 --> 00:47:42,893
Good evening, señora.

551
00:47:46,430 --> 00:47:48,131
Good evening, señora.

552
00:47:49,299 --> 00:47:53,537
So that's why you're by the window.

553
00:47:53,604 --> 00:47:56,640
Because Isagani is here.

554
00:47:56,707 --> 00:47:57,841
Come on!

555
00:47:58,375 --> 00:48:00,010
Go to your room!

556
00:48:11,889 --> 00:48:13,123
Oh, Isagani…

557
00:48:15,726 --> 00:48:20,264
Of all the women you can like,
why does it have to be Paulita?

558
00:48:21,531 --> 00:48:22,532
Look at what happened.

559
00:48:26,270 --> 00:48:27,437
I'll go ahead.

560
00:48:29,973 --> 00:48:31,942
Goodbye, my friend. See you.

561
00:48:33,610 --> 00:48:34,745
Goodbye, my friend.

562
00:49:21,425 --> 00:49:22,492
Good evening.

563
00:49:23,860 --> 00:49:25,729
Is that all the food?

564
00:49:26,930 --> 00:49:28,065
Everything is here.

565
00:49:30,434 --> 00:49:31,768
You came late.

566
00:49:32,536 --> 00:49:34,738
We thought you weren't coming anymore.

567
00:49:37,541 --> 00:49:38,909
Forgive me, my friend.

568
00:49:40,444 --> 00:49:44,514
I was with a woman earlier
on our way here to Laguna.

569
00:49:45,749 --> 00:49:47,184
I felt sorry for her

570
00:49:47,250 --> 00:49:49,486
so I let her ride
the carriage to ensure her safety.

571
00:49:50,454 --> 00:49:51,388
But,

572
00:49:52,556 --> 00:49:54,391
we got seized by the civil guards.

573
00:49:55,359 --> 00:49:59,296
The woman was arrested
because she didn't bring her cedula.

574
00:50:00,263 --> 00:50:01,965
What happened to the woman?

575
00:50:02,466 --> 00:50:04,401
And where did they take her?

576
00:50:04,468 --> 00:50:05,602
They imprisoned her.

577
00:50:06,870 --> 00:50:08,038
Poor woman.

578
00:50:09,773 --> 00:50:11,274
She also lives in your town.

579
00:50:12,442 --> 00:50:14,177
She's from San Diego, too?

580
00:50:15,779 --> 00:50:18,348
Yes. That's what I heard.

581
00:50:19,282 --> 00:50:20,584
I might know her.

582
00:50:21,184 --> 00:50:22,552
What's her name?

583
00:50:29,426 --> 00:50:30,394
You know what…

584
00:50:32,062 --> 00:50:34,064
maybe you do know this woman.

585
00:50:35,565 --> 00:50:36,566
She said…

586
00:50:37,567 --> 00:50:41,371
she has a rich relative in San Diego.

587
00:50:42,939 --> 00:50:45,575
I know every family in San Diego.

588
00:50:46,676 --> 00:50:48,145
But which family?

589
00:50:48,845 --> 00:50:50,580
And what's her name?

590
00:50:51,515 --> 00:50:52,516
<i>Halt!</i>

591
00:50:55,218 --> 00:50:56,453
-Come on!
-Come on, hurry!

592
00:50:56,520 --> 00:51:00,357
I'll just come back for you.
Until then! Take care!

593
00:52:21,872 --> 00:52:23,773
My poor and unfortunate mother.

594
00:52:24,708 --> 00:52:26,143
All her life,

595
00:52:27,744 --> 00:52:30,013
she never experienced comfort.

596
00:55:10,006 --> 00:55:10,940
Señor?

597
00:55:13,710 --> 00:55:15,812
Is there anything
I can help you with, señor?

598
00:55:28,391 --> 00:55:29,926
Señor Ibarra?

599
00:55:57,821 --> 00:55:58,788
Gregorio.

600
00:56:01,191 --> 00:56:02,359
This is for you.

601
00:56:05,261 --> 00:56:06,296
Rita.

602
00:56:09,032 --> 00:56:09,966
This is for you.

603
00:56:10,934 --> 00:56:13,636
And give this to Lucia when she returns.

604
00:56:15,538 --> 00:56:19,342
Comrades! Put down your daggers!

605
00:56:19,409 --> 00:56:22,212
And train yourselves to use the rifle.

606
00:56:24,247 --> 00:56:27,684
Why should I lay it down,
when I can use both?

607
00:56:31,855 --> 00:56:32,856
Arnulfo!

608
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:45,201
Hernando?

609
00:56:45,835 --> 00:56:47,237
Were you followed?

610
00:56:48,905 --> 00:56:50,039
No.

611
00:56:51,808 --> 00:56:52,909
Leader,

612
00:56:53,977 --> 00:56:55,111
good evening.

613
00:56:55,612 --> 00:56:56,613
Good evening.

614
00:56:57,947 --> 00:56:58,948
This is for you.

615
00:57:03,586 --> 00:57:04,587
Thank you.

616
00:57:07,123 --> 00:57:08,391
Well then, Hernando.

617
00:57:09,058 --> 00:57:12,262
You haven't answered my question yet.

618
00:57:13,997 --> 00:57:19,436
Who is this woman from San Diego
who was arrested by the civil guards?

619
00:57:23,740 --> 00:57:27,277
Well, she said she's the cousin of

620
00:57:28,344 --> 00:57:31,414
Maria Clara de los Santos y Alba.

621
00:57:33,416 --> 00:57:34,517
Do you know her?

622
00:57:35,084 --> 00:57:36,352
It's Maria Clara,

623
00:57:37,253 --> 00:57:41,591
who is now a nun
at the Saint Claire Monastery.

624
00:57:41,658 --> 00:57:44,194
Who doesn't know about her?

625
00:57:47,230 --> 00:57:50,099
But I didn't know she had a cousin.

626
00:57:51,801 --> 00:57:53,303
Who is this cousin of hers?

627
00:57:54,471 --> 00:57:56,339
What's her name?

628
00:57:57,240 --> 00:57:58,675
She said she is Ms. Klay.

629
00:58:31,641 --> 00:58:33,209
<i>At this very moment,</i>

630
00:58:33,276 --> 00:58:37,947
the civil guards
are already scouring the mountains

631
00:58:38,448 --> 00:58:43,152
<i>to find and hold the tulisanes accountable</i>

632
00:58:43,219 --> 00:58:45,655
<i>for killing my two civil guards.</i>

633
00:58:45,722 --> 00:58:47,924
And who would do such a thing

634
00:58:48,858 --> 00:58:51,794
if not those damned tulisanes!

635
00:58:51,861 --> 00:58:55,598
So it's just right to hunt

636
00:58:56,299 --> 00:58:57,767
and annihilate them.

637
00:58:57,834 --> 00:59:00,103
All right, you can have
the other things in my bag.

638
00:59:00,169 --> 00:59:02,939
The canned goods,
food, they are all yours.

639
00:59:03,006 --> 00:59:06,376
But the book,
I must have it. I cannot lose it.

640
00:59:07,277 --> 00:59:08,811
It will not disappear from our care.

641
00:59:09,812 --> 00:59:15,285
<i>I came here because of a woman
who's currently in your barrack's custody.</i>

642
00:59:16,052 --> 00:59:17,987
COMING UP

643
00:59:26,029 --> 00:59:29,299
