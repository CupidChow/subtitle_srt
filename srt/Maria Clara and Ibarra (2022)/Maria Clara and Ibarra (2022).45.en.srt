1
00:00:24,157 --> 00:00:27,527
MARIA CLARA AND IBARRA

2
00:00:27,594 --> 00:00:31,698
THIS PROGRAM, WHICH IS ADAPTED
FROM THE NOVELS OF DR. JOSE P. RIZAL,

3
00:00:31,765 --> 00:00:36,369
IS PRESENTED USING DRAMATIC ELEMENTS
TO CONNECT THE PRESENT AND THE PAST

4
00:00:36,436 --> 00:00:41,808
IN A SPECIAL REIMAGINING OF THE NATIONAL
LITERATURE FILIPINOS ARE PROUD OF.

5
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:43,977
I am only wondering…

6
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:48,648
what a jeweler like you
would need from a nun--

7
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:50,050
Curiosity.

8
00:00:50,116 --> 00:00:52,652
It was my curiosity
that pushed me to visit her

9
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,821
<i>but I was forbidden to enter
by one of the sisters.</i>

10
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:56,322
<i>So, I did not pursue it.</i>

11
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:58,992
<i>Maria Clara Infantes.</i>

12
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:01,661
-<i>Klay?</i>
-<i>It doesn't say here where you're from.</i>

13
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:03,663
I'm from San Diego.
I live with my relatives.

14
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:06,666
<i>Maria Clara de los Santos y Alba.</i>

15
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:07,767
Not only that.

16
00:01:07,834 --> 00:01:11,838
I'm also a close friend
of the wealthy jeweler.

17
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:13,239
<i>Señor Simoun.</i>

18
00:01:13,306 --> 00:01:14,407
<i>Is he really your friend</i>

19
00:01:14,474 --> 00:01:17,343
or are you just using his name
to escape punishment?

20
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:19,846
<i>Ask Señor Simoun to come here.</i>

21
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:23,016
<i>Tell him that Miss Klay is here.</i>

22
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:24,050
And you, Father?

23
00:01:24,117 --> 00:01:25,185
Why are you here?

24
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:30,557
Why don't you go up
to where your eminence belongs?

25
00:01:30,623 --> 00:01:33,960
Because my uncle is not like
others who are self-conceited.

26
00:01:34,027 --> 00:01:36,629
People who think of themselves
as gods who came down from heaven.

27
00:01:36,696 --> 00:01:38,264
Apologies, señor.

28
00:01:38,331 --> 00:01:39,699
Apologize, Isagani.

29
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:41,601
No need, Father.

30
00:01:41,668 --> 00:01:42,869
I was not offended.

31
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:44,037
What's the matter with you?

32
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:46,206
Why do you seem so angry at that person?

33
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:47,207
I do not know, but…

34
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:48,575
I have a bad feeling about him.

35
00:01:48,641 --> 00:01:52,378
Don't you know that he's known
as the Brown Cardinal

36
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:55,181
because the Captain General listens

37
00:01:55,248 --> 00:01:57,550
and does everything he says?

38
00:01:57,617 --> 00:01:58,885
<i>To be honest, Captain…</i>

39
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:00,720
Isagani also has a point.

40
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:05,625
<i>There is something unusual
about Señor Simoun.</i>

41
00:02:05,692 --> 00:02:07,760
Is there anything
I can help you with, señor?

42
00:02:08,995 --> 00:02:10,396
Señor Ibarra?

43
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:19,305
<i>Who is this woman from my town</i>

44
00:02:19,372 --> 00:02:20,740
<i>who was arrested by civil guards?</i>

45
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:22,308
She said she is the cousin of

46
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:25,512
Maria Clara de los Santos y Alba.

47
00:02:25,578 --> 00:02:27,147
Who is this cousin of hers?

48
00:02:27,213 --> 00:02:28,748
She said she is Miss Klay.

49
00:02:35,555 --> 00:02:36,956
Forgive me, señor…

50
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:39,859
if I scared you.

51
00:02:43,596 --> 00:02:46,132
I am only glad to see you again.

52
00:02:49,202 --> 00:02:53,506
Thirteen years have passed
since we last saw each other here.

53
00:03:01,147 --> 00:03:04,617
And who do you think I am?

54
00:03:05,985 --> 00:03:07,420
You are the gentleman…

55
00:03:10,089 --> 00:03:12,058
from my youth…

56
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:15,895
whom we respected very much.

57
00:03:15,962 --> 00:03:19,632
Me, my late mother, and brother.

58
00:03:22,602 --> 00:03:23,803
You, señor…

59
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:30,443
Everyone thought you were already dead.

60
00:03:32,845 --> 00:03:34,380
But…

61
00:03:34,447 --> 00:03:37,450
I'm the only one who knows the truth.

62
00:03:37,517 --> 00:03:40,220
Don't tell anyone that we know each other

63
00:03:40,286 --> 00:03:42,021
and that I am still alive.

64
00:03:46,926 --> 00:03:49,829
You hold the secret to my true identity.

65
00:03:51,864 --> 00:03:56,703
A secret that no one else can know.

66
00:03:56,769 --> 00:04:00,940
Especially my enemies.

67
00:04:09,182 --> 00:04:11,684
You are the hero from my childhood.

68
00:04:16,956 --> 00:04:19,025
Señor Crisostomo Ibarra.

69
00:04:28,067 --> 00:04:29,802
That is why…

70
00:04:29,869 --> 00:04:31,604
you embraced me earlier today.

71
00:04:34,407 --> 00:04:36,609
Don't worry, señor.

72
00:04:36,676 --> 00:04:40,713
I will keep your secret
as long as you want me to.

73
00:06:00,059 --> 00:06:02,061
Eat, woman.

74
00:06:02,128 --> 00:06:03,896
What time is it?

75
00:06:03,963 --> 00:06:05,698
Is there no news yet?

76
00:06:05,765 --> 00:06:08,534
Do you think the man you sent
to fetch Señor Simoun already reached him?

77
00:06:08,601 --> 00:06:09,802
Do not be impatient.

78
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:12,805
My comrade may already be
talking to him right now.

79
00:06:14,507 --> 00:06:15,842
That's good.

80
00:06:15,908 --> 00:06:17,009
Thank you.

81
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:20,446
You never failed me, Mister Adong.

82
00:06:22,915 --> 00:06:25,451
May your soul rest in peace.

83
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:34,360
What's inside, señor?

84
00:06:42,635 --> 00:06:43,636
Have a look.

85
00:06:50,943 --> 00:06:52,044
My God.

86
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:57,583
Who knew that the riches
of the Ibarras are here?

87
00:07:00,953 --> 00:07:06,125
Riches that we will use
to get this country back

88
00:07:07,126 --> 00:07:12,365
from the foreigners
who ruined me and Maria.

89
00:07:15,835 --> 00:07:19,038
We… will use them, señor?

90
00:07:21,407 --> 00:07:22,842
Yes, Basilio…

91
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:26,979
because you and I are one.

92
00:07:27,046 --> 00:07:31,884
Just like you, the Spaniards
also defiled my family.

93
00:07:32,985 --> 00:07:36,522
They're the reason why
your brother and mother are dead.

94
00:07:38,257 --> 00:07:39,725
But don't worry…

95
00:07:41,527 --> 00:07:44,230
the time for our revenge has come.

96
00:07:46,432 --> 00:07:52,371
Together, we will plan their downfall,

97
00:07:52,438 --> 00:07:56,075
and drive them out
of the Philippine islands.

98
00:08:15,728 --> 00:08:21,367
I cannot believe that you
and Señor Simoun are the same person.

99
00:08:24,136 --> 00:08:26,405
Based on the stories
that Father Florentino

100
00:08:26,472 --> 00:08:28,207
and Captain Basilio told us today…

101
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:32,512
you are the one advising
the Captain General

102
00:08:32,578 --> 00:08:35,481
to push for forced labor.

103
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:39,252
And that you're also advocating

104
00:08:39,318 --> 00:08:43,656
to increase the tax that people must pay.

105
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:48,227
All of that is true.

106
00:08:49,161 --> 00:08:50,162
Then…

107
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:53,699
what happened to the man I once admired?

108
00:08:56,802 --> 00:08:59,071
I'm using my head now.

109
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:04,377
Compared to Ibarra
who didn't use his head…

110
00:09:04,443 --> 00:09:06,712
who thought that it is enough
to help his countrymen

111
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:09,649
and to have a good heart.

112
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:14,153
Is this the reason why instead of helping
alleviate the lives of us Indios,

113
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:19,392
you are making our lives more miserable?

114
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:21,527
So that you will suffer more!

115
00:09:23,195 --> 00:09:24,797
So that you will be oppressed!

116
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:29,635
So you will learn to rebel.

117
00:09:39,378 --> 00:09:40,446
Sir?

118
00:09:42,481 --> 00:09:44,050
Can you hand me the book?

119
00:09:44,717 --> 00:09:46,152
It's important to me.

120
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:49,755
I'm already bored here inside.

121
00:09:49,822 --> 00:09:51,223
I've been doing nothing.

122
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:52,858
I want to read.

123
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:54,760
Didn't my officer inform you earlier

124
00:09:54,827 --> 00:09:58,698
that you can't touch any of your things
while you're still detained?

125
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:00,066
Come on.

126
00:10:00,132 --> 00:10:02,735
It's just a book.
There's nothing dangerous about that.

127
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:07,873
All right, you can have
the other contents of my bag.

128
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,241
The canned goods, food…

129
00:10:09,308 --> 00:10:10,610
They are all yours.

130
00:10:10,676 --> 00:10:14,880
But the book, I must have that book.
I cannot lose it.

131
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:17,149
It will not disappear from our care.

132
00:10:17,216 --> 00:10:18,417
So, please…

133
00:10:18,484 --> 00:10:22,221
will you shut up and stop disturbing me?

134
00:10:23,255 --> 00:10:24,690
What are you doing anyway?

135
00:10:30,529 --> 00:10:32,965
This wasn't part of the plan.

136
00:10:36,702 --> 00:10:38,004
What will I do?

137
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,608
Miss Klay?

138
00:10:43,609 --> 00:10:45,177
What does she look like?

139
00:10:45,244 --> 00:10:47,013
How tall is she?

140
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:49,281
Can you describe her?

141
00:10:50,449 --> 00:10:51,717
She's a beautiful woman.

142
00:10:53,452 --> 00:10:57,623
Slim, short, and has a fair complexion.

143
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:02,028
I think she has the blood of a…

144
00:11:02,094 --> 00:11:03,095
Chinese!

145
00:11:07,199 --> 00:11:08,701
Yes, right.

146
00:11:09,535 --> 00:11:10,469
Wait…

147
00:11:10,536 --> 00:11:14,040
if that's the case,
do you really know who this woman is?

148
00:11:14,106 --> 00:11:15,107
Fidel…

149
00:11:16,108 --> 00:11:18,477
are we thinking of the same person?

150
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:22,748
I will never forget that woman.

151
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:26,218
Hernando…

152
00:11:27,286 --> 00:11:31,223
Where did the civil guards take Miss Klay?

153
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:32,491
Take us there.

154
00:11:34,393 --> 00:11:35,895
Elias, please…

155
00:11:35,961 --> 00:11:37,663
Help me.

156
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:39,165
Yes, my friend.

157
00:11:39,231 --> 00:11:40,499
I'll never forsake you.

158
00:11:44,603 --> 00:11:45,771
Comrades!

159
00:11:45,838 --> 00:11:48,307
Prepare your weapons!

160
00:11:50,743 --> 00:11:52,344
We are going to save…

161
00:11:52,411 --> 00:11:55,881
the woman that I've been waiting for.

162
00:11:55,948 --> 00:11:58,050
Hernando, let us go.

163
00:11:58,117 --> 00:11:59,819
Comrades…

164
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:01,153
Let's hurry.

165
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,154
Let's go!

166
00:12:19,138 --> 00:12:23,109
The curate of San Diego is not here now.

167
00:12:23,175 --> 00:12:24,310
Why?

168
00:12:24,376 --> 00:12:26,479
What do you need?

169
00:12:26,545 --> 00:12:29,048
My superior ordered me to come here.

170
00:12:29,882 --> 00:12:31,917
We caught a woman.

171
00:12:31,984 --> 00:12:34,086
She said she's from San Diego.

172
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:38,491
Do you know who this person is, Father?

173
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:02,681
I know this woman.

174
00:13:06,218 --> 00:13:07,319
Where is she?

175
00:13:12,391 --> 00:13:14,760
I can feel that it will happen very soon.

176
00:13:17,396 --> 00:13:19,698
I saw your friend, Isagani…

177
00:13:21,834 --> 00:13:24,670
I can feel his hatred towards me.

178
00:13:26,772 --> 00:13:28,974
I know that his eyes are open…

179
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:31,043
to the sufferings of this country.

180
00:13:32,678 --> 00:13:34,847
So, perhaps with just a bit more push…

181
00:13:35,881 --> 00:13:38,050
he will be among the first ones to fight.

182
00:13:39,251 --> 00:13:40,319
But, señor…

183
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:43,856
Isagani and I want something else.

184
00:13:45,357 --> 00:13:47,193
Señor…

185
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:50,062
I will soon be a certified doctor.

186
00:13:51,697 --> 00:13:53,732
My other friends…

187
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:55,801
just like Isagani…

188
00:13:55,868 --> 00:13:57,736
also want to reach their dreams.

189
00:13:58,971 --> 00:14:02,107
Just like the school that we aim to build

190
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:04,977
that will teach Spanish to our countrymen.

191
00:14:11,984 --> 00:14:14,553
Why would you promote Hispanism?

192
00:14:15,888 --> 00:14:19,091
Don't you know that
this is a form of suicide?

193
00:14:21,927 --> 00:14:25,831
Speaking Spanish is not the basis
for the advancement of a person's ability.

194
00:14:27,299 --> 00:14:30,936
The people who do not know how
to love their own language…

195
00:14:31,937 --> 00:14:36,308
they are also the ones helping
destroy their national identity.

196
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:40,846
We will become a country with no identity!

197
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:43,315
A race…

198
00:14:44,516 --> 00:14:46,952
with no dignity.

199
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:51,423
You already witnessed that.

200
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:56,328
The cruelty that your mother
and brother experienced.

201
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:00,132
But what did you do…

202
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:03,869
to seek justice for them?

203
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:06,138
Señor…

204
00:15:09,608 --> 00:15:12,878
I cannot do anything to obtain justice.

205
00:15:15,147 --> 00:15:16,348
Because the truth is…

206
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,451
I am not wealthy.

207
00:15:21,687 --> 00:15:23,522
I am just a poor person…

208
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:26,825
who needs to work and serve others
just to get an education.

209
00:15:27,893 --> 00:15:28,827
And one more thing…

210
00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:33,966
Will I be able to bring back
the lives of my mother and Crispin?

211
00:15:38,003 --> 00:15:40,539
So what's the use for me to avenge them?

212
00:15:42,574 --> 00:15:44,043
What's the use…

213
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:46,178
if I join you with your plans?

214
00:15:50,182 --> 00:15:52,151
What is the death of a man

215
00:15:52,217 --> 00:15:55,487
in the presence of the death of society?

216
00:15:58,991 --> 00:16:01,393
A life lost is useless

217
00:16:02,494 --> 00:16:05,831
if it is not consecrated to a great idea.

218
00:16:07,566 --> 00:16:08,934
And you, sir…

219
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:14,373
will soon become a doctor.

220
00:16:16,842 --> 00:16:17,676
Someday…

221
00:16:18,777 --> 00:16:21,747
you will perhaps be a famous
and great physician…

222
00:16:22,881 --> 00:16:26,385
If they allow you
to practice medicine in peace.

223
00:16:28,687 --> 00:16:30,823
But what you're doing now is far greater…

224
00:16:30,889 --> 00:16:34,326
in giving life to this ailing country.

225
00:16:36,895 --> 00:16:39,064
You may not be able
to bring back their lives…

226
00:16:40,232 --> 00:16:43,535
but you will be able to stop
anyone from being sick

227
00:16:43,602 --> 00:16:45,537
and from losing a loved one

228
00:16:45,604 --> 00:16:48,974
due to the colonizers' cruelty to them.

229
00:16:53,812 --> 00:16:56,915
Think carefully about what I said…

230
00:16:56,982 --> 00:16:58,550
Doctor Basilio.

231
00:17:00,819 --> 00:17:03,822
There is a gathering I must go to.

232
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:31,216
No one can hinder and stop
the children of our motherland

233
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:34,787
from waking up…

234
00:17:34,853 --> 00:17:36,288
and revolting.

235
00:17:50,702 --> 00:17:52,471
Someone is coming. Hide!

236
00:18:00,045 --> 00:18:02,448
<i>At this very moment,</i>

237
00:18:02,514 --> 00:18:06,885
the civil guards are already
searching the mountains…

238
00:18:06,952 --> 00:18:10,823
to find and bring before justice…

239
00:18:10,889 --> 00:18:14,760
the bandits who killed
our two civil guards.

240
00:18:14,827 --> 00:18:20,599
Are we certain that they are
the ones who did it, General?

241
00:18:23,001 --> 00:18:26,004
And who would do such a thing

242
00:18:26,071 --> 00:18:28,774
if not those damned bandits!

243
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:34,746
So it is just right to hunt them…

244
00:18:34,813 --> 00:18:36,415
and annihilate them!

245
00:18:36,482 --> 00:18:37,749
Fidel…

246
00:18:37,816 --> 00:18:39,952
there are many more of them
compared to our numbers.

247
00:18:40,018 --> 00:18:41,720
So I will give the order to retreat.

248
00:18:43,188 --> 00:18:45,424
I am sure they will follow us.

249
00:18:45,491 --> 00:18:47,659
So I must praise you, my friend…

250
00:18:49,661 --> 00:18:53,198
because you are a ruler with an iron fist.

251
00:18:53,265 --> 00:18:57,035
Which is just right, so that
the people will fear you…

252
00:18:57,102 --> 00:18:58,737
and will simply follow.

253
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:03,509
Especially since no one is helping
to make this country progressive

254
00:19:04,076 --> 00:19:07,179
other than the most honorable Spain.

255
00:19:07,246 --> 00:19:09,148
There is still someone you must save.

256
00:19:09,214 --> 00:19:10,215
Am I right?

257
00:19:19,391 --> 00:19:20,325
Cheers!

258
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:22,427
Cheers!

259
00:19:25,964 --> 00:19:29,168
We will continue to exchange fire
for a few minutes

260
00:19:29,234 --> 00:19:31,970
to give you time to escape.

261
00:19:33,071 --> 00:19:35,140
And when you return…

262
00:19:35,207 --> 00:19:37,209
in case we are no longer at our hideout…

263
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:41,146
I will leave a note and put it
at the guava tree,

264
00:19:41,213 --> 00:19:42,814
so that you will know where we are.

265
00:19:44,816 --> 00:19:47,886
You are a brave leader…

266
00:19:47,953 --> 00:19:50,289
and you have concern for others.

267
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:52,024
Thank you, my friend.

268
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:56,094
I pray that you will find
and save the one you love.

269
00:19:59,331 --> 00:20:01,900
Until our resurrection, my friend.

270
00:20:05,003 --> 00:20:08,373
You count up to three, and then leave.

271
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:10,375
Thank you.

272
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:49,081
Basilio…

273
00:20:49,147 --> 00:20:50,415
What took you so long?

274
00:20:50,482 --> 00:20:53,151
-Good evening.
-I have been waiting for you.

275
00:20:53,218 --> 00:20:55,587
I just dropped by some place, Miss Etta.

276
00:20:57,055 --> 00:21:00,359
It seems that this place
does not get cleaned often.

277
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:01,526
Oh my, Miss Etta,

278
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:04,429
you will be scolded by
Captain Tiago and Madam Isabel.

279
00:21:04,496 --> 00:21:06,164
What if they suddenly come home

280
00:21:06,231 --> 00:21:08,800
and find out that their house
has been neglected?

281
00:21:08,867 --> 00:21:10,335
The Captain will not be coming home.

282
00:21:10,402 --> 00:21:12,904
There is no public smoking room here.

283
00:21:12,971 --> 00:21:16,508
He also cannot bear to not smoke opium.

284
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:20,812
Come on, Miss Etta.

285
00:21:20,879 --> 00:21:24,116
Captain Tiago's condition is improving.

286
00:21:24,182 --> 00:21:27,019
That's because I'm watching over him.

287
00:21:27,085 --> 00:21:30,689
But what about now
that you are not with him?

288
00:21:31,723 --> 00:21:33,825
Come on, Miss Etta…

289
00:21:33,892 --> 00:21:36,094
please have the house cleaned.

290
00:21:37,829 --> 00:21:41,033
I want Captain Tiago to stay here.

291
00:21:41,099 --> 00:21:43,902
I will take care of him
and watch over him here.

292
00:21:46,538 --> 00:21:48,006
I will go ahead.

293
00:21:48,073 --> 00:21:49,408
Wait, one moment.

294
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:54,379
Have you heard what happened
to your fiancee's father?

295
00:21:54,446 --> 00:21:55,947
Her father?

296
00:21:56,014 --> 00:21:57,482
What happened to Chief Tales?

297
00:21:57,549 --> 00:22:00,786
He was abducted by the bandits yesterday,

298
00:22:00,852 --> 00:22:03,922
and I heard that Juli is inconsolable.

299
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:07,359
She does not even know what to do.

300
00:22:13,598 --> 00:22:15,734
We are near the road, Hernando.

301
00:22:16,368 --> 00:22:19,037
I am sorry, but we cannot walk
on the road.

302
00:22:19,571 --> 00:22:22,607
It's easy for the civil guards on patrol
to see us.

303
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:24,409
We will walk here.

304
00:22:24,476 --> 00:22:28,246
We can hide in trees and shrubs
and they will barely notice us.

305
00:22:29,247 --> 00:22:33,552
Or better yet, why don't we rest for now?

306
00:22:33,618 --> 00:22:36,254
Let's just continue our journey tomorrow.

307
00:22:36,321 --> 00:22:38,623
Hernando, how can I rest

308
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:41,727
if it is indeed Miss Klay that you met…

309
00:22:41,793 --> 00:22:43,795
and she is in jail now?

310
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:46,198
Because I know her demeanor very well…

311
00:22:46,264 --> 00:22:48,633
I will be worried even more.

312
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:51,737
She might already have argued
with the civil guards…

313
00:22:51,803 --> 00:22:54,639
especially since she can't keep
her mouth shut.

314
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:56,541
So, Hernando…

315
00:22:56,608 --> 00:22:58,477
let's take advantage of the dark of night,

316
00:22:58,543 --> 00:23:01,613
so that we can reach the town
and the prison cells right away.

317
00:23:02,614 --> 00:23:03,615
Let's go.

318
00:23:11,289 --> 00:23:12,357
It is very beautiful!

319
00:23:14,092 --> 00:23:15,394
But it is very expensive.

320
00:23:18,163 --> 00:23:20,732
But I am not charging you for it, Father.

321
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:25,937
Instead, I will charge it to
the richest Indio of your parish.

322
00:23:27,472 --> 00:23:30,375
Just tell me his name

323
00:23:30,442 --> 00:23:32,644
and I will be the one to talk to him.

324
00:23:34,112 --> 00:23:35,947
I am sure he cannot refuse.

325
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:40,385
Don't worry, Father…

326
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:44,222
no one else will know.

327
00:23:49,828 --> 00:23:51,930
All right.

328
00:23:51,997 --> 00:23:55,867
I will write his name later
and I will give it to you.

329
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:58,069
That's excellent, Father.

330
00:24:01,473 --> 00:24:03,809
It seems that Father Salvi is not here.

331
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:09,981
He did not come because
he's not feeling well again.

332
00:24:11,049 --> 00:24:13,518
I am telling you, señor, it seems that…

333
00:24:13,585 --> 00:24:19,391
he will not live long because
he easily gets sick.

334
00:24:28,567 --> 00:24:29,534
What did you say?

335
00:24:30,101 --> 00:24:34,606
I said my apologies, but I must rest now.

336
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:38,643
Good evening and Merry Christmas
to you, Father.

337
00:24:40,245 --> 00:24:41,546
And to you as well, señor.

338
00:24:54,893 --> 00:24:55,894
Officer…

339
00:24:58,029 --> 00:25:00,365
Here is the former curate of San Diego.

340
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:07,606
Good evening.

341
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:11,309
My name is Bernardo Salvi.

342
00:25:13,311 --> 00:25:18,884
I am one of the counsels of
the current curate of San Diego.

343
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:20,218
An honor to meet you, Father.

344
00:25:20,285 --> 00:25:23,788
I came here because of a woman

345
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:26,324
who is currently in the care
of your prison.

346
00:25:32,063 --> 00:25:34,833
Are you also wondering about this?

347
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:38,503
You will be wondering even more
about the contents of her bag.

348
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:43,041
Even before, that woman has always been
different and acted strange.

349
00:25:57,422 --> 00:25:58,523
What is this?

350
00:26:05,463 --> 00:26:07,432
El Filibusterismo?

351
00:26:08,967 --> 00:26:10,335
How interesting.

352
00:26:13,104 --> 00:26:15,774
Have you read the contents of this book?

353
00:26:16,341 --> 00:26:17,475
Not yet, Father.

354
00:26:17,542 --> 00:26:18,843
But based on the title--

355
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:22,314
It might contain subversive text

356
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:25,183
if we base it on the title of the novel.

357
00:26:27,485 --> 00:26:33,525
It's not surprising
that you found this book on her.

358
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:35,360
Well then, where is she?

359
00:26:37,295 --> 00:26:40,365
Take me to her. I wish to see her.

360
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:41,499
Yes, Father.

361
00:26:44,235 --> 00:26:45,236
Let's go.

362
00:26:54,012 --> 00:26:54,980
<i>Really, Auntie?</i>

363
00:26:55,046 --> 00:26:56,514
<i>Klay is missing again?</i>

364
00:26:56,581 --> 00:26:58,883
She's been gone the whole day.

365
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:02,253
She's not even responding
to my calls and texts.

366
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:05,890
What could have happened
to your friend, Stacy?

367
00:27:07,892 --> 00:27:11,329
Did she go to another cosplay thing?

368
00:27:11,396 --> 00:27:16,801
Elias said that she was too busy
reading a book.

369
00:27:16,868 --> 00:27:20,005
She even mentioned something
about research.

370
00:27:20,071 --> 00:27:21,906
What was it?

371
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:25,977
She mentioned a different world
which I don't even understand.

372
00:27:26,044 --> 00:27:28,446
<i>Last time I saw her was yesterday, Auntie.</i>

373
00:27:28,513 --> 00:27:30,915
When she stole…

374
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:34,019
I mean, when she borrowed
the book from our professor.

375
00:27:34,085 --> 00:27:35,186
Book?

376
00:27:35,253 --> 00:27:37,722
<i>Yes, the</i> El Fili <i>book.</i>

377
00:27:37,789 --> 00:27:42,293
Because your crazy daughter said
that she needs the book to…

378
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:44,729
Hold on. What else did she say?

379
00:27:44,796 --> 00:27:47,832
I really hope this is the key
that could help me go back.

380
00:27:49,367 --> 00:27:51,136
Go back where?

381
00:27:51,202 --> 00:27:53,605
This is crazy. You only needed a book?

382
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:55,907
I could have lent you mine.

383
00:27:57,575 --> 00:27:58,877
Gosh, girl…

384
00:27:58,943 --> 00:28:01,112
This is not just a book.

385
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:03,214
I need this with me when I go back there.

386
00:28:03,281 --> 00:28:07,018
So when they tell me
that what I am saying is not true…

387
00:28:07,085 --> 00:28:08,420
I'll give this to them.

388
00:28:08,486 --> 00:28:11,690
"Here, ma'am, sir. Read this."
All the evidence is in there.

389
00:28:11,756 --> 00:28:14,592
The story of what will happen
to you is written there."

390
00:28:14,659 --> 00:28:17,028
Wait. Read by who?

391
00:28:17,095 --> 00:28:19,030
My new friends.

392
00:28:19,097 --> 00:28:21,066
Because they don't believe

393
00:28:21,132 --> 00:28:24,169
that <i>Noli</i> and <i>El Fili</i> are just stories.

394
00:28:24,235 --> 00:28:25,537
It's all made-up.

395
00:28:25,603 --> 00:28:28,973
At least if I bring this,
they will easily believe me.

396
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:32,977
It will be easier for me to save
the lives of Maria Clara and Ibarra.

397
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:34,813
Girl, are you okay?

398
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:37,449
Do I need to bring you
to a psychiatrist, huh?

399
00:28:39,984 --> 00:28:42,053
Let's just talk when I get back, okay?

400
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,154
-All right. Bye!
-Why…

401
00:28:44,255 --> 00:28:45,356
Wait, where are you going?

402
00:28:45,423 --> 00:28:46,624
Hey! She really ignored me.

403
00:28:46,691 --> 00:28:49,627
But your daughter never
responded to me, Auntie.

404
00:28:50,195 --> 00:28:52,497
<i>That was the last time I spoke with her.</i>

405
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:58,236
I want to help…

406
00:29:00,338 --> 00:29:01,473
my friends.

407
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:05,376
But in my current situation,
I'm so helpless.

408
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:08,379
My God.

409
00:29:09,347 --> 00:29:12,817
Is this the same thing
that my daughter told me about?

410
00:29:12,884 --> 00:29:15,220
The friends that she needs to help?

411
00:29:17,989 --> 00:29:20,525
What did my daughter get into?

412
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:22,927
Where could she be right now?

413
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:48,186
Father Salvi?

414
00:29:49,854 --> 00:29:51,389
Amazing…

415
00:29:53,391 --> 00:29:54,926
Miss Klay…

416
00:29:56,327 --> 00:29:58,496
You don't seem to have aged a day.

417
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:09,841
Wait…

418
00:30:12,076 --> 00:30:14,412
Do you need water, Hernando? Water?

419
00:30:18,349 --> 00:30:22,086
That's what happens to people
who don't exercise.

420
00:30:23,087 --> 00:30:27,392
You have a weak body
and you seem to be clumsy.

421
00:30:27,458 --> 00:30:28,426
Clumsy?

422
00:30:30,995 --> 00:30:34,799
Señor, we've been running for hours.

423
00:30:34,866 --> 00:30:36,935
I'm only human.

424
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:38,636
How long will you rest?

425
00:30:39,604 --> 00:30:42,740
I'm only thinking
about the time we're losing.

426
00:30:42,807 --> 00:30:46,277
How far away are we from
the prison that you told me about?

427
00:30:58,189 --> 00:30:59,190
We're near.

428
00:31:00,391 --> 00:31:02,060
In about thirty minutes,

429
00:31:02,126 --> 00:31:05,396
we will reach the center
where the prison is located.

430
00:31:05,463 --> 00:31:07,031
Thirty minutes…

431
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:10,301
It will be sunrise by then.

432
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:13,705
I need to see her now.

433
00:31:13,771 --> 00:31:15,773
I cannot wait any longer.

434
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,041
I'll go ahead.

435
00:31:18,676 --> 00:31:19,677
Wait, my friend…

436
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:23,681
Really?

437
00:31:24,916 --> 00:31:26,284
He really left me.

438
00:31:30,688 --> 00:31:31,689
My God…

439
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:34,859
A tree monster might be lurking nearby.

440
00:31:34,926 --> 00:31:35,894
I'll catch up with him.

441
00:31:37,495 --> 00:31:43,101
What magic do you possess
that prevents you from aging

442
00:31:43,167 --> 00:31:45,303
and allows you to remain young?

443
00:31:48,406 --> 00:31:50,875
You're really concerned about
my skincare right now, Father?

444
00:31:54,445 --> 00:31:55,813
I'm not even surprised.

445
00:31:57,081 --> 00:31:58,116
Facial cream.

446
00:32:00,785 --> 00:32:02,453
Cream that you put on your face

447
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:06,257
to prevent wrinkles and eye bags.

448
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:10,662
You want some, Father?

449
00:32:10,728 --> 00:32:12,931
-I have it in my bag--
-Silence.

450
00:32:14,165 --> 00:32:17,168
I never imagined we would see
each other again.

451
00:32:21,172 --> 00:32:22,807
In that case…

452
00:32:22,874 --> 00:32:25,944
you may be the woman
that the nun told me about

453
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:28,646
who wanted to visit Maria Clara.

454
00:32:29,747 --> 00:32:31,683
Why did you come back?

455
00:32:31,749 --> 00:32:36,187
What trouble do you bring
to Maria Clara's life this time?

456
00:32:38,756 --> 00:32:39,757
Trouble?

457
00:32:45,563 --> 00:32:46,764
What did you say?

458
00:32:48,433 --> 00:32:51,703
From which depth of hell did you
come from, you devil woman?

459
00:32:54,038 --> 00:32:58,576
You will regret returning here.

460
00:33:00,745 --> 00:33:02,580
Because I assure you…

461
00:33:04,782 --> 00:33:08,386
that you will rot in prison.

462
00:33:08,453 --> 00:33:10,088
For what case, Father?

463
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:13,424
For many cases, miss.

464
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:15,426
Whatever I could think of.

465
00:33:16,594 --> 00:33:20,131
The first one is of you
being a filibuster!

466
00:33:21,232 --> 00:33:25,803
Especially since you possess
this kind of book…

467
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:37,448
which I presume contains subversive text.

468
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:46,124
Give me that.

469
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:47,592
Give me that!

470
00:33:47,658 --> 00:33:49,861
It's nothing! Everything in there
is nonsense, Father!

471
00:33:49,927 --> 00:33:51,229
Give it!

472
00:33:51,796 --> 00:33:52,630
I said give it back!

473
00:33:53,998 --> 00:33:56,300
With the way you're acting…

474
00:33:56,367 --> 00:34:00,838
looking pale and so scared…

475
00:34:04,909 --> 00:34:09,847
I think this book contains
something important.

476
00:34:14,952 --> 00:34:17,155
Sir…

477
00:34:18,823 --> 00:34:22,527
Where is that civil guard that
you sent to fetch Señor Simoun?

478
00:34:22,593 --> 00:34:24,829
Why did he come here instead?
Where is señor Si…

479
00:34:25,763 --> 00:34:30,234
You and the Brown Cardinal
know each other?

480
00:34:34,972 --> 00:34:38,609
I just want to talk to the Brown Cardinal…

481
00:34:40,778 --> 00:34:42,847
so I can sue this friar!

482
00:34:45,349 --> 00:34:47,251
You are so gutsy.

483
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,421
Let us see…

484
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:56,527
if the kind gentleman will help you.

485
00:34:57,528 --> 00:35:00,631
After he finds out what kind
of woman you are.

486
00:35:07,538 --> 00:35:09,006
Señor…

487
00:35:09,574 --> 00:35:12,877
tell the civil guards who will
come with us to get ready…

488
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:16,814
because we are returning
to the town of San Diego.

489
00:35:17,381 --> 00:35:19,016
I want to put…

490
00:35:20,918 --> 00:35:23,020
this woman…

491
00:35:23,087 --> 00:35:25,356
in a prison near where I am.

492
00:35:28,226 --> 00:35:30,661
So that I can always keep an eye on her.

493
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:35,133
Consider it done, Father.

494
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:37,768
De Paz, call your companions!

495
00:35:37,835 --> 00:35:39,704
Quick!

496
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:41,172
Right away, sir.

497
00:36:29,086 --> 00:36:31,255
<i>Where are you, Crisostomo?</i>

498
00:36:32,823 --> 00:36:34,425
<i>Where are you, my love?</i>

499
00:36:41,899 --> 00:36:42,800
Come back.

500
00:36:43,801 --> 00:36:45,236
Come back here.

501
00:36:51,108 --> 00:36:54,278
Save me. Save me, my love.

502
00:36:57,248 --> 00:36:59,083
Where are you?

503
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:07,758
Come back here.
Come back here, my love, and save me.

504
00:37:17,034 --> 00:37:18,202
Save me.

505
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:21,205
Save me, Crisostomo.

506
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:24,141
Maria!

507
00:37:32,049 --> 00:37:33,050
Señor…

508
00:37:35,953 --> 00:37:37,321
Beloved curate…

509
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:41,225
what are you doing in my room?

510
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:46,330
The Captain General asked me
to wake you up.

511
00:37:46,397 --> 00:37:48,299
We need to go hunting in the forest early.

512
00:37:51,035 --> 00:37:52,870
Were you having a nightmare, señor?

513
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:57,174
Who is this Maria you are referring to?

514
00:38:04,248 --> 00:38:06,817
Please tell the Captain General…

515
00:38:07,785 --> 00:38:09,353
that I will just get dressed.

516
00:38:10,354 --> 00:38:11,922
Thank you very much.

517
00:38:30,374 --> 00:38:31,842
There…

518
00:38:31,909 --> 00:38:33,744
That is the town prison.

519
00:38:36,013 --> 00:38:38,749
But we can't just go near that prison.

520
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:40,851
There are civil guards.

521
00:38:40,918 --> 00:38:42,019
How strange…

522
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:44,789
There are many civil guards tonight

523
00:38:44,855 --> 00:38:46,457
compared to the last time I was here.

524
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:49,660
Hernando…

525
00:38:51,028 --> 00:38:53,964
we cannot go near that prison right away.

526
00:38:54,031 --> 00:38:56,500
We need to leave our guns here.

527
00:38:56,567 --> 00:38:59,437
We must pretend to be ordinary citizens

528
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:02,973
and that we went there
to seek help for a problem.

529
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,041
Let me take care of it.

530
00:39:05,042 --> 00:39:06,043
Come on.

531
00:39:08,412 --> 00:39:09,413
Here.

532
00:39:27,231 --> 00:39:28,599
It's Father Salvi…

533
00:39:31,168 --> 00:39:32,336
If so…

534
00:39:33,804 --> 00:39:35,072
he already saw…

535
00:39:37,441 --> 00:39:38,576
Hey! Block her!

536
00:39:38,642 --> 00:39:40,378
-Hey!
-Where are you going?

537
00:39:40,444 --> 00:39:41,779
Let go of me!

538
00:40:00,364 --> 00:40:01,665
My heart flutters…

539
00:40:03,634 --> 00:40:04,869
and…

540
00:40:04,935 --> 00:40:06,103
I lose my breath…

541
00:40:08,305 --> 00:40:09,907
my Miss Klay…

542
00:40:11,942 --> 00:40:12,943
Hurry!

543
00:40:13,944 --> 00:40:14,945
Hurry…

544
00:40:16,113 --> 00:40:17,581
Wait…

545
00:40:17,648 --> 00:40:19,250
You can't go near them.

546
00:40:19,316 --> 00:40:20,418
The friar will recognize you

547
00:40:20,484 --> 00:40:22,386
and I am sure that he will
have you arrested.

548
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:26,524
Listen to me…

549
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:28,759
we can't save the lady

550
00:40:28,826 --> 00:40:30,861
if you will also be imprisoned.

551
00:40:35,299 --> 00:40:36,300
Hurry!

552
00:40:38,335 --> 00:40:40,037
We can go now.

553
00:40:44,575 --> 00:40:45,576
Go on! Walk!

554
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:08,365
Wait.

555
00:41:08,432 --> 00:41:09,667
Fidel…

556
00:41:09,733 --> 00:41:10,935
Fidel.

557
00:41:11,001 --> 00:41:12,369
Let go of me, Hernando!

558
00:41:12,436 --> 00:41:13,838
Listen!

559
00:41:13,904 --> 00:41:16,106
Miss Klay needs me.

560
00:41:16,173 --> 00:41:18,042
I know.

561
00:41:18,108 --> 00:41:20,244
But will you really
expose yourself to danger?

562
00:41:21,745 --> 00:41:25,316
You have been out of sight
of the enemies for many years.

563
00:41:25,382 --> 00:41:26,717
And now…

564
00:41:27,885 --> 00:41:29,386
you want to be reckless?

565
00:41:29,453 --> 00:41:31,655
You want to expose yourself to them now?

566
00:41:31,722 --> 00:41:34,825
I had to endure thirteen years

567
00:41:34,892 --> 00:41:37,094
of being apart from the woman I love…

568
00:41:38,095 --> 00:41:40,764
and now that she's back…

569
00:41:40,831 --> 00:41:42,766
I won't let the two of us be apart again.

570
00:41:44,835 --> 00:41:46,570
I understand, but…

571
00:41:46,637 --> 00:41:48,138
Fidel, stay calm.

572
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:51,008
Wait!

573
00:42:43,627 --> 00:42:46,530
Forgive me, Grandfather…

574
00:42:46,597 --> 00:42:48,899
if I have to leave you alone here.

575
00:42:51,468 --> 00:42:53,304
What is important is that…

576
00:42:53,370 --> 00:42:55,272
father will finally go home.

577
00:43:11,622 --> 00:43:14,391
I pray everyday…

578
00:43:14,458 --> 00:43:17,962
that I can pay my debt
to Sister Penchang soon.

579
00:43:20,764 --> 00:43:24,668
So that we can all be together again.

580
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:32,843
And I can once again
be with the one I love.

581
00:43:41,018 --> 00:43:41,986
Juli…

582
00:43:43,787 --> 00:43:44,755
Basilio?

583
00:43:50,527 --> 00:43:51,495
Grandfather Selo…

584
00:43:52,963 --> 00:43:55,065
may I please speak with Juli?

585
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:11,281
My love…

586
00:44:18,822 --> 00:44:21,091
I heard about what happened
to Mister Tales.

587
00:44:24,161 --> 00:44:27,431
Did you recognize the bandits
who abducted him?

588
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:33,003
Did they ask for ransom?

589
00:44:39,109 --> 00:44:40,978
My God, Juli…

590
00:44:42,112 --> 00:44:45,049
are they aware that the court

591
00:44:45,115 --> 00:44:47,451
and the corporation have
decimated your properties?

592
00:44:48,552 --> 00:44:50,587
And now they have abducted him!

593
00:45:00,931 --> 00:45:01,832
What is this?

594
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:06,837
You seem to be packing your things, Juli?

595
00:45:06,904 --> 00:45:09,573
The bandits are asking
for ransom for Father

596
00:45:11,341 --> 00:45:13,677
in the sum of five hundred pesos.

597
00:45:15,612 --> 00:45:18,882
I don't know where to get
that amount of money!

598
00:45:20,951 --> 00:45:26,523
So I was forced to go to Sister Penchang,

599
00:45:26,590 --> 00:45:28,325
and she lent me money.

600
00:45:29,593 --> 00:45:30,994
But she wanted something in return.

601
00:45:32,763 --> 00:45:35,332
In return, I will be her servant.

602
00:45:38,635 --> 00:45:44,007
I am hoping and praying to God…

603
00:45:45,075 --> 00:45:46,877
and to all the saints!

604
00:45:48,245 --> 00:45:51,448
Now that I have paid the bandits, Basilio…

605
00:45:53,183 --> 00:45:56,186
they will bring Father home
any moment now.

606
00:45:59,323 --> 00:46:02,760
But I don't think I will get
to see that moment

607
00:46:02,826 --> 00:46:05,028
because I need to go.

608
00:46:05,095 --> 00:46:07,931
I need to become a servant
to the one I owed money from.

609
00:46:14,538 --> 00:46:15,539
Wait…

610
00:46:30,954 --> 00:46:33,023
the pendant that I gave you as a gift.

611
00:46:38,662 --> 00:46:39,930
It will stay here.

612
00:46:43,233 --> 00:46:45,402
Why did you not pawn this?

613
00:46:46,837 --> 00:46:49,706
You don't need to be a slave
to Sister Penchang.

614
00:46:52,843 --> 00:46:54,044
That cannot be.

615
00:46:55,779 --> 00:47:00,684
Isn't this a gift from a kind woman
to a man with leprosy?

616
00:47:07,858 --> 00:47:09,259
The leper said…

617
00:47:10,961 --> 00:47:13,864
that this was a gift
from Señorita Maria Clara.

618
00:47:20,070 --> 00:47:22,773
It is a symbol of a kind heart…

619
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:24,641
which is invaluable.

620
00:47:26,743 --> 00:47:32,549
Plus the leper gave this to you
when you helped him on the road.

621
00:47:32,616 --> 00:47:35,118
Which I then gifted to you…

622
00:47:35,185 --> 00:47:36,353
as a symbol…

623
00:47:37,487 --> 00:47:40,657
of my heart that loves you.

624
00:47:55,639 --> 00:47:56,707
Fool!

625
00:47:57,274 --> 00:47:58,642
If you keep walking slowly,

626
00:47:58,709 --> 00:48:02,279
I will make the horse run
so you will be dragged!

627
00:48:08,385 --> 00:48:09,486
Jose Rizal?

628
00:48:11,355 --> 00:48:12,589
Who is he?

629
00:48:15,459 --> 00:48:22,366
And where did this creature
get the strength to publish…

630
00:48:22,432 --> 00:48:25,335
a book about filibusterism?

631
00:48:29,873 --> 00:48:32,676
The title is in Spanish, but the…

632
00:48:34,011 --> 00:48:37,881
contents are in the
language of the Indios.

633
00:48:39,016 --> 00:48:41,018
<i>First chapter.</i>

634
00:48:41,084 --> 00:48:43,086
<i>One morning in December,</i>

635
00:48:43,153 --> 00:48:46,456
<i>the dipper-shaped ship was traversing</i>
<i>the circuitous path</i>

636
00:48:47,024 --> 00:48:49,359
<i>of the Pasig River.</i>

637
00:48:49,426 --> 00:48:54,298
<i>Doña Victorina was very disgusted that day</i>

638
00:48:54,364 --> 00:48:57,601
<i>because the passengers were ignoring her.</i>

639
00:48:57,668 --> 00:49:02,472
<i>Those Indios are slowing down our journey,</i>

640
00:49:02,539 --> 00:49:06,209
<i>and the progress of the Philippines.</i>

641
00:49:06,276 --> 00:49:10,514
<i>The Indios are not the problem.</i>
<i>The river is the problem.</i>

642
00:49:12,115 --> 00:49:18,255
<i>The solution to your argument is easy!</i>

643
00:49:24,861 --> 00:49:26,697
<i>Amazing!</i>

644
00:49:26,763 --> 00:49:29,333
<i>That's a great idea!</i>

645
00:49:31,568 --> 00:49:34,438
<i>But a huge amount is needed for that.</i>

646
00:49:34,504 --> 00:49:39,009
<i>Who will pay for it and how</i>
<i>will we pay the laborers?</i>

647
00:49:40,410 --> 00:49:43,313
<i>We do not need to pay the Indios,</i>

648
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:46,516
<i>especially if the prisoners</i>
<i>will become laborers.</i>

649
00:49:47,884 --> 00:49:48,986
<i>And it will be better</i>

650
00:49:49,052 --> 00:49:52,756
<i>if the government imposes forced labor</i>

651
00:49:52,823 --> 00:49:56,994
<i>on men who are aged sixteen to sixty.</i>

652
00:49:57,060 --> 00:49:58,061
<i>How terrifying!</i>

653
00:49:59,229 --> 00:50:00,230
<i>How did he…</i>

654
00:50:02,032 --> 00:50:03,533
Halt!

655
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:04,601
Stop!

656
00:50:12,376 --> 00:50:13,543
Come here!

657
00:50:18,548 --> 00:50:20,617
What kind of book is this?

658
00:50:23,186 --> 00:50:24,788
Who is Jose Rizal?

659
00:50:26,623 --> 00:50:31,795
And how did he know
the exact events on the ship?

660
00:50:31,862 --> 00:50:35,298
Even our discussion…

661
00:50:35,365 --> 00:50:38,535
he predicted and he even printed?

662
00:50:40,904 --> 00:50:42,839
I knew it.

663
00:50:44,374 --> 00:50:45,642
Look at me.

664
00:50:48,445 --> 00:50:50,647
Answer my question.

665
00:50:52,015 --> 00:50:53,950
Is Rizal a member…

666
00:50:54,951 --> 00:50:58,388
of your group of witches?

667
00:51:04,394 --> 00:51:06,096
I knew it.

668
00:51:07,464 --> 00:51:10,801
You are a demon!

669
00:51:10,867 --> 00:51:12,035
You are a devil!

670
00:51:12,602 --> 00:51:13,970
Am I really the devil?

671
00:51:15,072 --> 00:51:17,207
You are the one who tied me up.

672
00:51:17,274 --> 00:51:20,544
All the evil things you did in this town…

673
00:51:20,610 --> 00:51:23,914
it is you, Father, who is the real devil!

674
00:51:24,781 --> 00:51:26,349
Shameless!

675
00:51:28,852 --> 00:51:32,856
You will really regret coming back here!

676
00:51:35,325 --> 00:51:36,893
Give me that!

677
00:51:42,632 --> 00:51:44,234
Introduce yourself!

678
00:51:44,301 --> 00:51:49,139
You are Satan concealed in a human body!

679
00:52:15,298 --> 00:52:16,933
<i>What is happening to you, Pablito?</i>

680
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,169
<i>You seem to be blinded by anger and power!</i>

681
00:52:19,236 --> 00:52:21,638
<i>You are also oppressing the oppressed?</i>

682
00:52:21,705 --> 00:52:22,939
You better pray…

683
00:52:23,006 --> 00:52:24,774
to whomever you worship, woman.

684
00:52:24,841 --> 00:52:26,877
I will make sure…

685
00:52:26,943 --> 00:52:29,813
<i>that you will return to the hell
you came from.</i>

686
00:52:30,313 --> 00:52:32,916
<i>The villain is already reading the story.</i>

687
00:52:32,983 --> 00:52:34,784
He will find out about Simoun.

688
00:52:34,851 --> 00:52:36,386
I think it is better
if we leave this place.

689
00:52:36,453 --> 00:52:39,789
<i>Hernando, I know to which town
they brought Miss Klay.</i>

690
00:52:39,856 --> 00:52:40,857
Who are you?

691
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:47,898
Why do you need to bring me food
as if I am sick or a prisoner?

692
00:52:47,964 --> 00:52:50,000
Señor, come with us right away!

693
00:52:50,066 --> 00:52:51,434
The carriage is waiting!

694
00:52:51,501 --> 00:52:56,640
<i>I am just making sure that
you will be away from danger.</i>

695
00:53:05,182 --> 00:53:08,451
