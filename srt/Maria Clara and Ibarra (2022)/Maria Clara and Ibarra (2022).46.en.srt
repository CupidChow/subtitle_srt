00:00:30,764 --> 00:00:34,634
MARIA CLARA AND IBARRA

2
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:38,505
THIS PROGRAM, WHICH IS ADAPTED
FROM THE NOVELS OF DR. JOSE P. RIZAL,

3
00:00:38,571 --> 00:00:42,442
IS PRESENTED USING DRAMATIC ELEMENTS
TO CONNECT THE PRESENT AND THE PAST

4
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:46,379
IN A SPECIAL REIMAGINING OF THE NATIONAL
LITERATURE FILIPINOS ARE PROUD OF.

5
00:00:46,446 --> 00:00:48,915
<i>Thirteen years have passed.</i>

6
00:00:48,982 --> 00:00:50,517
<i>Where are you now, miss?</i>

7
00:00:50,583 --> 00:00:52,352
<i>Will you still come back for me?</i>

8
00:00:52,419 --> 00:00:53,853
Or have you forgotten me?

9
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,022
Don't make any moves!
Show me your identification.

10
00:00:56,089 --> 00:00:58,491
PREVIOUSLY…

11
00:01:02,095 --> 00:01:05,532
I was only gone for a while, my friend,
yet you have caused trouble again.

12
00:01:05,598 --> 00:01:07,200
<i>The pendant I gave you as a gift,</i>

13
00:01:07,267 --> 00:01:09,202
why did you not pawn it?

14
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:13,873
<i>Isn't this a kind woman's gift
to a man with leprosy?</i>

15
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:17,544
It is a symbol of a kind heart,
which is invaluable.

16
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:23,383
Which I then gave to you
as a symbol of my heart that loves you.

17
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:25,218
<i>Saint Claire Monastery?</i>

18
00:01:25,285 --> 00:01:27,220
According to the novel,
she is supposed to be here.

19
00:01:27,287 --> 00:01:30,056
Maria Clara, don't lose hope!

20
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:40,233
<i>I turned away the young woman
who was looking for you earlier.</i>

21
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:42,068
<i>And what is the name of the woman?</i>

22
00:01:42,135 --> 00:01:43,570
Miss Klay.

23
00:01:43,636 --> 00:01:49,209
<i>I only wonder why a jeweler like you</i>

24
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:52,412
<i>would want to visit the monastery.</i>

25
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:56,082
<i>It was my curiosity
that pushed me to visit her,</i>

26
00:01:56,149 --> 00:01:59,252
<i>but a nun forbade me from entering
so I did not pursue it again.</i>

27
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:01,621
<i>Who is this woman
who claims to be from my town</i>

28
00:02:01,688 --> 00:02:03,590
<i>and was arrested by the civil guards?</i>

29
00:02:03,656 --> 00:02:08,128
She claims to be a cousin
of Maria Clara de los Santos y Alba.

30
00:02:08,194 --> 00:02:09,796
Who is this cousin of hers?

31
00:02:09,863 --> 00:02:11,431
She said she is Miss Klay.

32
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:15,602
Is there anything
I can help you with, señor?

33
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:18,004
Señor Ibarra?

34
00:02:18,071 --> 00:02:20,740
You hold the secret to my true identity.

35
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:24,277
<i>A secret that no one else can know.</i>

36
00:02:24,344 --> 00:02:25,778
Don't worry, señor.

37
00:02:25,845 --> 00:02:28,781
I will keep your secret
for as long as you want me to.

38
00:02:28,848 --> 00:02:31,117
<i>The time for our revenge has come.</i>

39
00:02:31,184 --> 00:02:35,488
Together, we will plan their downfall

40
00:02:35,555 --> 00:02:38,758
and force them out
of the Philippine Islands.

41
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:40,927
<i>Prepare your weapons!</i>

42
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:44,564
We are going to save
the woman I've been waiting for.

43
00:02:44,631 --> 00:02:47,400
I came here because of a woman

44
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:49,636
who is currently in your prison.

45
00:02:49,702 --> 00:02:53,139
You wonder even more
about the contents of her bag.

46
00:02:53,206 --> 00:02:55,208
"<i>El Filibusterismo</i>"?

47
00:02:55,275 --> 00:02:56,309
How interesting.

48
00:02:56,376 --> 00:02:57,977
What kind of book is this?

49
00:02:58,044 --> 00:03:02,482
<i>And how did this foresee
the exact events on the ship?</i>

50
00:03:02,549 --> 00:03:06,986
Is Rizal a member
of your coven of witches?

51
00:03:07,053 --> 00:03:08,488
Reveal yourself!

52
00:03:08,555 --> 00:03:13,226
You are a devil in this human body!

53
00:03:19,232 --> 00:03:21,201
So horrific, Father.

54
00:03:21,267 --> 00:03:24,771
The woman is neither crying nor pleading.

55
00:03:26,406 --> 00:03:30,843
This woman seems to be
possessed by the devil.

56
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:37,917
Ever since then, Miss Klay,
you have been a thorn in our side!

57
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:46,759
You are the devil in this story.

58
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:51,831
Because of all the horrible things
you did to my friends

59
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:54,000
and all the Filipinos here.

60
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:56,769
You are the devil, Father.

61
00:03:57,937 --> 00:04:01,140
Back then, we just wanted to be heard!

62
00:04:01,207 --> 00:04:02,275
But what happened?

63
00:04:03,309 --> 00:04:05,511
Your lies and threats

64
00:04:06,546 --> 00:04:10,183
covered the ears of the government
and the people.

65
00:04:11,951 --> 00:04:14,087
So why would I cry?

66
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:17,991
I won't even beg you for anything.

67
00:04:25,698 --> 00:04:26,833
Well then…

68
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:31,471
have a taste of your enemy's anger.

69
00:04:32,672 --> 00:04:34,440
Not my most beloved!

70
00:04:35,575 --> 00:04:36,476
No!

71
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:39,345
Miss Klay might get hurt.

72
00:04:41,748 --> 00:04:43,683
Father, we need to get out of here!

73
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,218
Get back in the carriage.

74
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:48,888
What are you doing?

75
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:50,356
Get inside!

76
00:04:52,692 --> 00:04:54,527
-Hurry!
-Faster, woman!

77
00:04:54,594 --> 00:04:55,862
I don't want to sit beside him.

78
00:04:55,928 --> 00:04:56,796
Faster!

79
00:04:58,264 --> 00:04:59,265
That was close.

80
00:05:00,066 --> 00:05:02,468
We should get out of here now.

81
00:05:02,535 --> 00:05:05,972
Hernando, I know
where they're taking Miss Klay.

82
00:05:06,873 --> 00:05:08,074
Let's go.

83
00:05:09,275 --> 00:05:10,443
The Enlightened!

84
00:05:11,411 --> 00:05:12,545
My goodness!

85
00:05:12,612 --> 00:05:13,813
He left me again.

86
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:21,487
So why would I pawn something
given to me by the man I love?

87
00:05:25,725 --> 00:05:26,826
Darling…

88
00:05:29,629 --> 00:05:34,767
Things will only be harder for you
if you always worry about me.

89
00:05:38,938 --> 00:05:43,176
You should pawn this,
so you won't have to suffer anymore.

90
00:05:43,776 --> 00:05:45,478
For your own good.

91
00:05:46,779 --> 00:05:52,285
Basilio, let me worry
about how I'm going to pay my debts.

92
00:05:54,153 --> 00:05:55,855
I will get through this.

93
00:05:59,258 --> 00:06:01,160
I promise you, my darling…

94
00:06:04,397 --> 00:06:06,065
I will find a way…

95
00:06:07,567 --> 00:06:09,268
to pay your debts.

96
00:06:11,504 --> 00:06:12,805
And I will do everything

97
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,677
for your family
to be reunited in this house.

98
00:06:17,744 --> 00:06:24,617
I won't let you
or Sir Tales suffer ever again.

99
00:06:41,768 --> 00:06:44,904
My daughter did her part
no matter how difficult it was.

100
00:06:44,971 --> 00:06:46,773
Why didn't you do yours?

101
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:49,175
You have no integrity!

102
00:06:50,443 --> 00:06:52,812
Because I know
you can give me more than that.

103
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:54,747
You will not get anything more from me.

104
00:06:54,814 --> 00:06:57,884
The court and the corporation
already took everything I had!

105
00:06:59,018 --> 00:07:00,553
You're a liar, former leader!

106
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:01,854
Pablito!

107
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:21,007
You seem to be in the wrong camp, Elias.

108
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:27,146
Am I not allowed to visit my old comrades?

109
00:07:27,213 --> 00:07:28,414
Comrades?

110
00:07:29,849 --> 00:07:32,618
The group you once led,
which had so many restrictions?

111
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:40,026
A group that does not take advantage
and fights for what is right.

112
00:07:40,827 --> 00:07:42,995
What is happening to you, Pablito?

113
00:07:43,062 --> 00:07:45,665
You are blinded by anger and power!

114
00:07:46,165 --> 00:07:48,634
You are oppressing your fellow man?

115
00:07:48,701 --> 00:07:51,971
Asking for help is not oppression, Elias.

116
00:07:52,572 --> 00:07:55,441
And neither is extorting a poor man
whose hope was taken away

117
00:07:55,508 --> 00:07:57,210
by greedy conquerors?

118
00:07:59,278 --> 00:08:02,181
You and Lucia were separated
from your parents

119
00:08:02,248 --> 00:08:04,283
because of the evildoings of those friars.

120
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:10,723
I hope you think about
how his loved ones also long for him.

121
00:08:13,726 --> 00:08:15,328
Let him go now, Pablito.

122
00:08:16,462 --> 00:08:19,165
Focus your eyes on the real enemy.

123
00:08:26,038 --> 00:08:27,807
You are useless!

124
00:08:28,574 --> 00:08:29,475
Just them?

125
00:08:30,276 --> 00:08:35,748
There are a lot of complaints
and accusations of theft.

126
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:40,253
Yet you only caught two bandits?

127
00:08:41,254 --> 00:08:44,457
You are pitiful, San Diego.

128
00:08:45,324 --> 00:08:47,527
Go now! Take them inside!

129
00:08:53,633 --> 00:08:56,035
And you! What is your problem?

130
00:08:56,602 --> 00:09:01,173
Doña Victorina is asking
if you have new information

131
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:04,710
about her missing spouse.

132
00:09:04,777 --> 00:09:07,680
Tell your ill-mannered madam

133
00:09:08,948 --> 00:09:13,152
to stop looking for someone
who doesn't want to be found.

134
00:09:16,489 --> 00:09:17,623
Go now!

135
00:09:21,861 --> 00:09:27,667
If I were Doña Victorina, I wouldn't hope
for a certain general to help me

136
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:31,837
when he himself just
got stuck in this town.

137
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:33,139
What did you say?

138
00:09:33,205 --> 00:09:35,641
Nothing, sir. Nothing.

139
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:39,712
Here. This is from Father Florentino.

140
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:42,782
He noticed there were still no lanterns

141
00:09:42,848 --> 00:09:44,350
when it's already December.

142
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,255
Thank you.

143
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:54,527
What a day this is!

144
00:09:55,528 --> 00:10:00,900
It looks like His Reverence fought
against the servants of the devil.

145
00:10:02,168 --> 00:10:04,036
The bandits, Señor Alvarez.

146
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:07,006
They may be comrades
of the devil's servants we caught.

147
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:10,176
Let me go!

148
00:10:10,242 --> 00:10:12,244
Oh, what's this?

149
00:10:16,515 --> 00:10:18,284
The strange woman.

150
00:10:21,687 --> 00:10:24,724
I will never forget, Miss Klay.

151
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:30,296
The stranger
who shook the town of San Diego.

152
00:10:32,164 --> 00:10:35,968
The rebel who helped
the filibusters escape!

153
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:41,207
But how…

154
00:10:42,108 --> 00:10:42,975
How strange!

155
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:46,078
I remember this woman.

156
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:51,350
More than a decade has passed
but she didn't seem to age.

157
00:10:51,417 --> 00:10:57,723
What do you use on your face
that keeps you from aging?

158
00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:02,194
Whatever it is,
I'm sure Consolacion will like it!

159
00:11:04,397 --> 00:11:05,765
Please!

160
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:09,535
I still haven't forgotten
how your wife mistreated Sisa!

161
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:11,704
Sisa?

162
00:11:13,272 --> 00:11:15,541
The dead mother of Basilio.

163
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:18,911
Do not raise your voice at me, <i>India</i>!

164
00:11:20,379 --> 00:11:21,847
Lock this bandit up!

165
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:25,117
Let go of me!

166
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:37,897
Let go of me!

167
00:11:42,835 --> 00:11:43,736
Ouch!

168
00:11:47,139 --> 00:11:48,808
You animals.

169
00:11:50,776 --> 00:11:52,111
Stand guard outside.

170
00:11:52,178 --> 00:11:54,280
This is your fault. Let me out of here!

171
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:57,049
Why?

172
00:11:57,116 --> 00:11:59,819
So you can spread fear in San Diego

173
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:04,924
with those evil bandits?

174
00:12:12,431 --> 00:12:13,966
I am going to read this book.

175
00:12:15,968 --> 00:12:17,603
And you better pray

176
00:12:18,504 --> 00:12:21,373
this is not Satan's doing.

177
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:25,177
This contains events
and incidents that are about to happen.

178
00:12:31,851 --> 00:12:33,619
Is this a revenge plot?

179
00:12:38,858 --> 00:12:41,494
You seem scared.

180
00:12:42,228 --> 00:12:43,162
Very well…

181
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:46,332
As early as now…

182
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:51,804
Start praying to whoever
you worship, woman.

183
00:12:52,805 --> 00:12:54,373
Because I will come back for you…

184
00:12:56,075 --> 00:12:57,710
and I will make sure…

185
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:02,948
you go back to the hell you came from.

186
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:31,844
Basilio…

187
00:13:32,945 --> 00:13:37,349
A Chinese man came here.
He said he wanted to buy the house.

188
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:41,921
He heard that Don Tiago might die soon.

189
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:48,360
Next time, tell him
this house is not for sale.

190
00:13:49,428 --> 00:13:52,598
Captain Tiago is still alive,
and yet they already think him dead.

191
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:55,134
In that case, forgive me for my words.

192
00:13:55,901 --> 00:13:58,270
I am sorry, Etta.

193
00:13:59,238 --> 00:14:03,676
But today has been really difficult.
I have many things on my mind.

194
00:14:10,549 --> 00:14:11,517
Basilio!

195
00:14:12,084 --> 00:14:13,786
-Isagani.
-How is Juli?

196
00:14:14,787 --> 00:14:18,591
I heard from the people in Tiani that
she's going to work for Sister Penchang.

197
00:14:23,562 --> 00:14:25,497
Do you still have the strength
to go to Macaraig

198
00:14:25,564 --> 00:14:26,932
and talk to him about the academy?

199
00:14:26,999 --> 00:14:28,868
You can go ahead.

200
00:14:30,269 --> 00:14:32,137
I still need to pay off Juli's debt.

201
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:35,274
And how do you plan to do that, my friend?

202
00:14:35,341 --> 00:14:37,309
First, I need to find Señor Simoun…

203
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:42,348
so I can ask for help from him.

204
00:14:43,282 --> 00:14:45,317
Help from the Brown Cardinal?

205
00:14:45,851 --> 00:14:50,623
Do you really intend to ask
that arrogant man who hates all <i>Indios</i>?

206
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:58,964
Maybe he has the influence to help,
but are you sure he can help you, Basilio?

207
00:14:59,031 --> 00:15:03,269
Stop judging someone
you don't know, Isagani.

208
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:07,573
Are you saying you really know him?

209
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:14,747
It seems the people of San Diego
have become hot-tempered.

210
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:17,950
There's even a commotion at the prison.

211
00:15:19,952 --> 00:15:22,855
Do you know there is a woman
who was locked up?

212
00:15:24,957 --> 00:15:26,258
She mentioned your mother.

213
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:28,494
What was her name again?

214
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:30,095
Kla…

215
00:15:30,863 --> 00:15:32,097
Klay?

216
00:15:36,001 --> 00:15:36,969
Klay?

217
00:15:40,005 --> 00:15:43,242
I already found a way to take you away
from that mean curate!

218
00:15:43,309 --> 00:15:44,543
Really?

219
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:47,079
But what about our means of living?

220
00:15:47,146 --> 00:15:50,182
Don't worry, Sir Ibarra
will take care of you.

221
00:15:50,749 --> 00:15:53,552
I promise, we will never abandon you.

222
00:15:56,355 --> 00:15:57,489
<i>Ate</i> Klay?

223
00:15:58,257 --> 00:15:59,992
Right. It is "Klay."

224
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:02,895
But why do you call her elder sister?

225
00:16:03,696 --> 00:16:05,898
She looks to be the same age as us.

226
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:22,781
My God…

227
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:27,686
The villain will read the story.

228
00:16:30,055 --> 00:16:34,560
He will find out about Simoun
and his plans.

229
00:16:41,233 --> 00:16:44,203
I think I got Sir Ibarra
into more trouble.

230
00:16:45,404 --> 00:16:47,506
Oh, it's all my fault!

231
00:17:01,053 --> 00:17:02,554
"On the Deck"?

232
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:06,258
The lower deck?

233
00:17:09,962 --> 00:17:11,663
"The Legends…"

234
00:17:12,564 --> 00:17:14,233
Cabeza Tales?

235
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:19,805
What is that <i>Indio</i> doing here?

236
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:29,181
"The Christmas Eve of a Coachman…"

237
00:17:32,851 --> 00:17:34,186
"Basilio"?

238
00:17:37,122 --> 00:17:38,857
Who is this Basilio?

239
00:17:47,366 --> 00:17:48,901
"Chapter Seven…"

240
00:17:53,605 --> 00:17:54,740
"Simoun"?

241
00:18:13,959 --> 00:18:17,396
Miss, San Diego's future doctor
wants to see you.

242
00:18:18,831 --> 00:18:19,832
Señor.

243
00:18:41,186 --> 00:18:42,421
It is true…

244
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,226
You came back.

245
00:18:50,996 --> 00:18:55,267
And it seems like,
your appearance has not changed.

246
00:18:57,436 --> 00:18:58,804
Do I know you?

247
00:19:00,239 --> 00:19:01,206
Who are you?

248
00:19:07,713 --> 00:19:08,647
Klay…

249
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:12,618
It's me…

250
00:19:14,686 --> 00:19:15,821
Basilio.

251
00:19:19,258 --> 00:19:21,860
That is our house, miss.

252
00:19:21,927 --> 00:19:24,396
Oh, it's so cute.

253
00:19:24,463 --> 00:19:25,731
<i>Basilio…</i>

254
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:27,633
Just stay here, okay?

255
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,369
Take care of your brother, okay?

256
00:19:32,738 --> 00:19:34,106
Basilio?

257
00:19:54,927 --> 00:19:56,094
My God!

258
00:19:57,062 --> 00:19:58,430
Baby boy!

259
00:20:00,432 --> 00:20:02,267
How you've grown!

260
00:20:04,269 --> 00:20:06,371
And you're so handsome!

261
00:20:09,074 --> 00:20:12,377
It's good you heard that I'm here.

262
00:20:15,347 --> 00:20:18,417
It can be a good thing
for a town to have many gossipers.

263
00:20:22,821 --> 00:20:24,256
Basilio…

264
00:20:24,323 --> 00:20:25,924
is he your good friend?

265
00:20:26,692 --> 00:20:28,193
Yes, Klay.

266
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:29,895
His name is Isagani.

267
00:20:30,829 --> 00:20:31,897
Hello, miss.

268
00:20:34,266 --> 00:20:35,667
Isagani?

269
00:20:37,135 --> 00:20:38,637
This is crazy.

270
00:20:39,204 --> 00:20:41,540
I am seeing you in the flesh!

271
00:20:43,842 --> 00:20:45,444
And because of that,

272
00:20:46,445 --> 00:20:48,480
I have so many things
I want to explain to you,

273
00:20:48,547 --> 00:20:50,582
but I don't have time.

274
00:20:52,951 --> 00:20:54,519
Which part of the book are we in now?

275
00:20:55,454 --> 00:20:57,522
Basilio, what's going on with you?

276
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:00,726
Have you met with Simoun at the graveyard?

277
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:07,599
How did you know that, Klay?

278
00:21:08,867 --> 00:21:10,335
So you have met.

279
00:21:13,205 --> 00:21:14,973
The story is already moving!

280
00:21:19,344 --> 00:21:22,814
You mentioned a book earlier
and now you're talking about a story?

281
00:21:30,422 --> 00:21:32,724
The story of Simoun's revenge…

282
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:36,762
Or of Crisostomo Ibarra.

283
00:21:40,866 --> 00:21:42,301
How amazing, Klay!

284
00:21:42,834 --> 00:21:43,702
How…

285
00:21:44,369 --> 00:21:45,437
How did you know?

286
00:21:46,605 --> 00:21:48,974
Were you there
at the graveyard that night?

287
00:21:50,842 --> 00:21:51,843
I wasn't.

288
00:21:53,712 --> 00:21:55,781
The truth is, we have not seen each other.

289
00:21:57,115 --> 00:21:58,083
But…

290
00:22:00,052 --> 00:22:03,922
Señor Ibarra is very different
from when he first met him, right?

291
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:12,097
I am using my mind more now,
as compared to Ibarra who had a weak mind,

292
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:16,668
who thought that helping others
and being kind was enough.

293
00:22:16,735 --> 00:22:22,407
Now, he wants to make people suffer
to force out their anger

294
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:25,277
and revolt against the Spaniards, right?

295
00:22:26,311 --> 00:22:29,114
Instead of bettering
the lives of us <i>Indios</i>,

296
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:33,118
you are causing us to suffer even more.

297
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:35,220
So you suffer even more!

298
00:22:35,287 --> 00:22:36,688
So you feel even more oppressed!

299
00:22:36,755 --> 00:22:39,958
So you learn to revolt!

300
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:45,297
He is no longer the patient
and kind gentleman.

301
00:22:46,498 --> 00:22:47,632
Klay…

302
00:22:48,567 --> 00:22:50,402
Señor Simoun is…

303
00:22:52,304 --> 00:22:54,072
an ally of the Spaniards.

304
00:22:56,074 --> 00:22:57,409
He is just putting up an act.

305
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:01,413
He is just doing that
so he can gain power.

306
00:23:02,414 --> 00:23:04,883
That's why he also
befriended the Captain General

307
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:06,685
and all the people in power.

308
00:23:08,987 --> 00:23:10,989
You really know that Simoun?

309
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:14,126
I'm sorry, wait!

310
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:18,063
We have not reached
the part you are in yet.

311
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:20,132
And we must not reach that point.

312
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:28,540
But Klay…

313
00:23:29,541 --> 00:23:32,277
How did you know
about our conversation if…

314
00:23:33,678 --> 00:23:36,047
you and the señor have not met yet?

315
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:42,854
I read about it.

316
00:23:50,462 --> 00:23:52,531
Father Irene said he will just rest.

317
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:56,067
But I wonder why
Father Salvi did not join us.

318
00:23:57,369 --> 00:23:58,904
We came to Laguna

319
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:02,841
because there is something
we wish to discuss, Captain General.

320
00:24:02,908 --> 00:24:05,377
What is it, Your Holiness?

321
00:24:06,211 --> 00:24:11,683
The help we can give to the town of Tiani,

322
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:13,652
where I am the curate.

323
00:24:13,718 --> 00:24:15,454
Apologies, Captain General,

324
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:19,825
but there is also a petition
from the students of Father Irene

325
00:24:19,891 --> 00:24:23,395
to establish a school to teach Spanish.

326
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:28,567
My apologies, Mr. Secretary…

327
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:32,838
but those young people are delirious!

328
00:24:32,904 --> 00:24:35,340
But their leaders are known
to be good citizens.

329
00:24:35,407 --> 00:24:40,479
Isagani and Basilio are
good, law-abiding men.

330
00:24:40,545 --> 00:24:42,981
If they learn how to speak Spanish,

331
00:24:43,949 --> 00:24:47,552
they will soon question the laws
which have long guided

332
00:24:47,619 --> 00:24:50,021
the Philippine Islands.

333
00:24:50,088 --> 00:24:52,491
We do not need a school like that.

334
00:24:53,225 --> 00:24:54,726
Especially since we ourselves

335
00:24:54,793 --> 00:24:58,830
learned the language of the <i>Indios</i>
so we could understand them.

336
00:24:58,897 --> 00:25:04,236
After they learn your language,
what will they ask for next?

337
00:25:05,537 --> 00:25:07,305
To remove forced labor?

338
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:09,007
Tributes?

339
00:25:09,574 --> 00:25:10,742
Monopolies?

340
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:12,844
And then what?

341
00:25:14,212 --> 00:25:15,413
Independence?

342
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:19,284
Or perhaps assimilation first, señor?

343
00:25:21,419 --> 00:25:22,454
Assimilation?

344
00:25:24,789 --> 00:25:27,926
Is this really what you want
for your country?

345
00:25:27,993 --> 00:25:29,194
Assimilation?

346
00:25:30,262 --> 00:25:31,263
Your Reverence?

347
00:25:31,329 --> 00:25:32,597
Gentlemen?

348
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:35,634
Your Excellency?

349
00:25:36,835 --> 00:25:39,304
The Brown Cardinal is correct

350
00:25:40,105 --> 00:25:43,608
about their desire to learn our language.

351
00:25:43,675 --> 00:25:48,647
They do not even know our language,
but they are already asking for changes.

352
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:50,315
For a revolution.

353
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:56,021
In Tiani for example,
where I am the curate,

354
00:25:57,255 --> 00:26:02,193
the bandits' numbers are increasing
instead of decreasing.

355
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:06,264
And they kidnap their fellow <i>Indios</i>.

356
00:26:07,265 --> 00:26:11,336
Just like the father of a poor woman…

357
00:26:13,505 --> 00:26:14,606
Juli.

358
00:26:16,441 --> 00:26:19,344
You have nothing to fear, Father Camorra.

359
00:26:20,879 --> 00:26:22,948
We have the weapons.

360
00:26:29,788 --> 00:26:33,992
It is very easy to break
the horns of the <i>Indios.</i>

361
00:26:41,666 --> 00:26:44,202
Good job, Simoun! You hit it!

362
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:54,479
<i>"The jeweler is digging…</i>

363
00:26:58,316 --> 00:27:02,187
<i>streams of light…</i>

364
00:27:03,822 --> 00:27:05,957
<i>shine on his face.</i>

365
00:27:06,024 --> 00:27:11,863
<i>He was not wearing blue glasses,
which changes his appearance."</i>

366
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:14,432
Is there anything
I can help you with, señor?

367
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:25,577
Señor Ibarra?

368
00:27:44,396 --> 00:27:45,797
Crisostomo is alive?

369
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:51,636
And he is Simoun?

370
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:57,275
I know you're confused right now.

371
00:27:58,076 --> 00:28:02,347
It's hard to explain
everything I said because…

372
00:28:02,414 --> 00:28:04,149
I don't have the proof.

373
00:28:05,784 --> 00:28:06,951
How about this?

374
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:11,289
First, look for Simoun
and tell him I'm here.

375
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:13,558
Tell him what happened to me, okay?

376
00:28:15,727 --> 00:28:21,599
But that's where he's headed, miss,
to help his beloved.

377
00:28:24,636 --> 00:28:26,638
Right! There's that!

378
00:28:29,407 --> 00:28:30,775
All right.

379
00:28:30,842 --> 00:28:33,378
How about this, Basilio?
Listen to me carefully, all right?

380
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:36,648
Basilio!

381
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:41,286
I know you have
important things to attend to.

382
00:28:43,855 --> 00:28:45,490
But believe me…

383
00:28:46,124 --> 00:28:50,395
if you do what I ask you,
everything else will follow.

384
00:28:51,663 --> 00:28:53,832
We will find a way to help Juli…

385
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:57,502
Your girlfriend's problem.

386
00:29:00,872 --> 00:29:02,607
Can I count on your help?

387
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:04,542
Both of you?

388
00:29:07,045 --> 00:29:08,279
Yes, Klay.

389
00:29:09,347 --> 00:29:10,448
Thank you.

390
00:29:11,683 --> 00:29:13,818
All right, go now. Find Simoun.

391
00:29:14,385 --> 00:29:18,456
I'm scared that Father Salvi
will find out who he is

392
00:29:18,523 --> 00:29:19,991
and his true identity anytime now.

393
00:29:21,159 --> 00:29:24,496
I'm sure he has read the book by now.

394
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:29,734
Miss, you keep mentioning that book.
What is it about?

395
00:29:30,835 --> 00:29:34,506
Let's talk about it some other time.
Go find Simoun first.

396
00:29:34,572 --> 00:29:36,441
You need to get me out of here!

397
00:29:37,742 --> 00:29:40,011
I have something important to tell him.

398
00:29:40,078 --> 00:29:44,282
There is so much he needs to know.
You have so much you need to know.

399
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,095
Thank you so much.

400
00:29:58,763 --> 00:30:00,465
I owe my freedom to you.

401
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:07,005
I apologize for what
my former comrade did.

402
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:15,046
Sometimes, because of hunger,
people tend to make mistakes and misdeeds.

403
00:30:16,047 --> 00:30:18,316
Even people like us
who fight against Spain.

404
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:23,755
You don't have to apologize, Elias.

405
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:29,294
I am used to having bad luck in life.

406
00:30:30,929 --> 00:30:34,499
They will give you a bit of hope
through a short period of bliss.

407
00:30:36,234 --> 00:30:38,436
But they will just
take it back in the end.

408
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,808
They are merciless.

409
00:30:45,443 --> 00:30:47,278
They are foreigners on our land,

410
00:30:47,345 --> 00:30:49,681
but they continue
to take everything that is ours.

411
00:30:50,882 --> 00:30:53,318
Maybe we share the same fate.

412
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:57,055
We are all <i>Indios.</i>

413
00:30:58,756 --> 00:31:02,594
The oppressors took everything
my ancestors had.

414
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:05,296
That is why I'm still fighting
against them.

415
00:31:07,465 --> 00:31:13,571
But if we fight our fellow Indios
and we let ourselves become divided,

416
00:31:14,606 --> 00:31:16,040
this will never end.

417
00:31:18,476 --> 00:31:23,348
Whatever happens, you can count on me.

418
00:31:25,116 --> 00:31:28,519
Go now. My group and I
still have much to do.

419
00:31:30,321 --> 00:31:31,489
Take care.

420
00:31:33,992 --> 00:31:36,361
Until we meet again, my friend.

421
00:31:50,675 --> 00:31:52,877
Who are you? What are you doing here?

422
00:31:52,944 --> 00:31:53,778
Señor…

423
00:31:55,446 --> 00:31:56,814
I just need…

424
00:32:04,155 --> 00:32:06,157
Hernando, take care of this.

425
00:32:06,724 --> 00:32:07,859
Be careful, my friend.

426
00:32:32,684 --> 00:32:35,186
-Isagani.
-The carriage is downstairs.

427
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:38,156
Basilio, you still haven't answered me.

428
00:32:39,057 --> 00:32:44,162
Who is that Klay? And how does she
know so much about Sir Simoun?

429
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:48,032
I'll explain eventually, Isagani.

430
00:32:49,067 --> 00:32:53,371
For now, what's more important
is for us to move.

431
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:57,942
The Captain General's
vacation house is far from here.

432
00:32:58,009 --> 00:32:59,711
We need to go now.

433
00:33:00,912 --> 00:33:06,551
But you said that Juli and her family are
facing a huge problem right now.

434
00:33:07,285 --> 00:33:09,053
Shouldn't you attend to that first?

435
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:16,394
With everything that's happening now,
I think I need to do both.

436
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:23,434
All I know is, Sir Simoun
will be able to help me with that.

437
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:24,902
Let's go.

438
00:33:24,969 --> 00:33:26,637
Señor Basilio…

439
00:33:32,243 --> 00:33:33,311
Father…

440
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:38,683
Basilio…

441
00:33:42,086 --> 00:33:42,987
Father…

442
00:33:47,425 --> 00:33:48,526
It hurts!

443
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,561
What are you doing here?

444
00:33:51,129 --> 00:33:54,866
If you don't have time
for courtesy visits, so do I.

445
00:33:56,567 --> 00:33:58,603
I'll cut to the chase, Basilio.

446
00:33:59,337 --> 00:34:02,940
When did you last talk
to that jeweler Simoun?

447
00:34:04,242 --> 00:34:07,578
There… On the ship.

448
00:34:11,582 --> 00:34:15,720
So what I have read in the book is true.

449
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:24,662
After that…

450
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:31,235
You met Sir Simoun where your late mother,

451
00:34:32,236 --> 00:34:34,005
who lost her mind, was buried.

452
00:34:43,548 --> 00:34:45,583
Based on your reaction,

453
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:49,187
it is true that you met
Señor Simoun there.

454
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:56,494
Or maybe we can call him
Crisostomo Ibarra?

455
00:35:08,072 --> 00:35:10,174
I do not understand, Father.

456
00:35:12,043 --> 00:35:17,348
Why would you call him Crisostomo Ibarra?

457
00:35:19,584 --> 00:35:22,386
He's been dead for a long time.

458
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:24,322
Stop lying, you fool!

459
00:35:27,658 --> 00:35:29,527
Tell me the truth.

460
00:35:30,728 --> 00:35:33,798
Or else I will have you arrested

461
00:35:33,865 --> 00:35:38,236
and have you join that demon Klay.

462
00:35:41,339 --> 00:35:42,607
I repeat…

463
00:35:46,577 --> 00:35:48,346
Are Crisostomo Ibarra…

464
00:35:50,114 --> 00:35:52,650
and Simoun one and the same?

465
00:36:17,275 --> 00:36:18,442
Who are you?

466
00:36:31,789 --> 00:36:33,024
Hey!

467
00:37:20,838 --> 00:37:22,006
Fidel?

468
00:37:24,308 --> 00:37:25,376
Klay…

469
00:37:31,716 --> 00:37:33,251
Forgive me, Father.

470
00:37:33,884 --> 00:37:36,754
But I really do not know
what you are saying.

471
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:43,227
Or maybe you want me
to send someone to the forest…

472
00:37:45,229 --> 00:37:47,431
to dig up the remains of your mother

473
00:37:48,366 --> 00:37:52,203
and throw them away in an unknown place?

474
00:37:54,338 --> 00:37:57,475
Forgive me, Father, but that is too cruel.

475
00:37:58,109 --> 00:37:59,677
He said he has nothing to do--

476
00:37:59,744 --> 00:38:02,913
Stay out of this, <i>Indio</i>!

477
00:38:08,319 --> 00:38:09,620
Very well, Basilio…

478
00:38:10,855 --> 00:38:16,694
Would you like your mother's soul
to be disturbed again?

479
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:25,369
Let us also include your brother Crispin.

480
00:38:25,436 --> 00:38:26,971
That's enough, Father!

481
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:35,246
Do not drag my mother
and brother into this!

482
00:38:36,681 --> 00:38:39,450
Aren't you content
with what you did back then?

483
00:38:40,551 --> 00:38:41,719
Please stop!

484
00:38:41,786 --> 00:38:43,254
Ouch!

485
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:48,793
Especially to Crispin!

486
00:38:54,899 --> 00:38:58,002
I just want to know the truth!

487
00:39:00,938 --> 00:39:03,207
But there is no need for you to talk.

488
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:11,916
Based on your tears and shivers…

489
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:16,887
what's written in the book is right.

490
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:23,227
That Simoun and the filibuster Ibarra…

491
00:39:26,397 --> 00:39:28,399
are one and the same.

492
00:39:28,466 --> 00:39:30,034
Thank you very much.

493
00:39:31,335 --> 00:39:34,271
If so, Father, where is the book?

494
00:39:35,005 --> 00:39:40,344
In a safe place where only I can read it,

495
00:39:40,411 --> 00:39:41,712
and no one else.

496
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:13,577
It's their fault
that your brother and mother died.

497
00:40:14,645 --> 00:40:15,613
My friend…

498
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:22,353
I'm confused with everything
that's happening.

499
00:40:28,459 --> 00:40:34,165
We need to talk to Sir Simoun
as soon as possible.

500
00:40:34,231 --> 00:40:35,666
Miss Klay…

501
00:40:58,122 --> 00:40:59,690
How I've missed you.

502
00:41:00,491 --> 00:41:01,759
If only you knew.

503
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:07,665
I've waited for you
for so long, Miss Klay.

504
00:41:10,868 --> 00:41:12,570
I am thankful you came back.

505
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:53,210
Fidel!

506
00:41:54,245 --> 00:41:55,246
Let's go.

507
00:41:57,915 --> 00:42:00,117
You… The coachman?

508
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:02,753
It is me, miss.

509
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:04,922
But let's catch up later.

510
00:42:05,422 --> 00:42:07,691
They are almost here. Let's go!

511
00:42:09,927 --> 00:42:10,961
Wait. My bag.

512
00:42:11,762 --> 00:42:12,863
The book…

513
00:42:15,099 --> 00:42:16,634
Where would he hide it?

514
00:42:17,234 --> 00:42:19,570
I need to take the book back
from that bald priest.

515
00:42:21,639 --> 00:42:23,240
From Father Salvi?

516
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:28,379
Oh, crap!

517
00:42:29,246 --> 00:42:30,514
Servant…

518
00:42:30,581 --> 00:42:33,751
Are you sure you did not recognize
the men who attacked us?

519
00:42:33,817 --> 00:42:34,652
I did not.

520
00:42:35,152 --> 00:42:36,620
You are useless!

521
00:42:36,687 --> 00:42:38,322
General…

522
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:40,624
I was on my way to your house.

523
00:42:40,691 --> 00:42:42,259
I have something to report.

524
00:42:42,826 --> 00:42:44,662
Apologies, Father, but…

525
00:42:45,663 --> 00:42:48,065
A disturbance has been
reported at the prison.

526
00:42:58,242 --> 00:43:01,178
Maybe that witch was able to escape.

527
00:43:17,161 --> 00:43:18,429
So shameless!

528
00:43:19,730 --> 00:43:21,498
So useless!

529
00:43:21,565 --> 00:43:22,700
You are worthless!

530
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:27,271
What happened here?

531
00:43:28,172 --> 00:43:29,073
Señor…

532
00:43:29,974 --> 00:43:31,175
The bandits attacked us!

533
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:36,380
And they took the woman with them!

534
00:43:37,982 --> 00:43:38,983
You fools!

535
00:43:39,717 --> 00:43:40,718
You're all so useless!

536
00:43:40,784 --> 00:43:44,455
The sun is shining brightly
and yet a woman managed to escape?

537
00:43:44,521 --> 00:43:45,589
So stupid!

538
00:43:46,190 --> 00:43:49,326
Find and arrest that woman!

539
00:43:51,228 --> 00:43:52,363
The book…

540
00:44:03,974 --> 00:44:05,743
Where is that mysterious book?

541
00:44:06,343 --> 00:44:07,711
Father…

542
00:44:07,778 --> 00:44:09,279
Father, they took it.

543
00:44:09,847 --> 00:44:12,783
If I am not mistaken,
it was Klay and her group who took it!

544
00:44:13,751 --> 00:44:16,253
You fool! How stupid!

545
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:18,789
Why did you let them have the book?

546
00:44:19,356 --> 00:44:21,792
He did not even worry
about what happened to me.

547
00:44:21,859 --> 00:44:23,293
You devil!

548
00:44:25,763 --> 00:44:28,766
You and Crisostomo will not succeed.

549
00:44:30,768 --> 00:44:35,372
Because I will reveal his true identity.

550
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:50,888
Wait!

551
00:44:51,922 --> 00:44:53,624
We better rest here.

552
00:44:57,127 --> 00:45:00,898
Goodness! I never thought
I would get this back.

553
00:45:03,767 --> 00:45:06,870
I waited for this moment
for thirteen years.

554
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:13,277
I think this is
the happiest day of my life, Miss Klay.

555
00:45:20,117 --> 00:45:20,984
You are right.

556
00:45:23,087 --> 00:45:24,688
Thirteen years…

557
00:45:26,990 --> 00:45:31,195
For me, it was just three days
and yet, I was already struggling.

558
00:45:31,729 --> 00:45:35,966
But how is it that you do not seem
to have aged at all?

559
00:45:37,401 --> 00:45:40,804
You look the same as when you left.

560
00:45:43,207 --> 00:45:46,143
You still look young…

561
00:45:47,277 --> 00:45:50,180
and very beautiful.

562
00:45:56,086 --> 00:45:57,354
You too.

563
00:45:58,822 --> 00:46:00,491
Your hair grew long.

564
00:46:00,557 --> 00:46:03,260
You look rugged, but…

565
00:46:04,962 --> 00:46:06,230
you've still got it.

566
00:46:08,832 --> 00:46:12,336
You really joined those
who are fighting for the country.

567
00:46:16,006 --> 00:46:20,844
I am doing this so that
the next generations

568
00:46:20,911 --> 00:46:25,516
would not need to fight for
their independence from the oppressors.

569
00:46:35,259 --> 00:46:38,829
I thought you did that
for our love to win.

570
00:46:39,763 --> 00:46:41,532
So we will be the endgame.

571
00:46:44,168 --> 00:46:45,169
Just kidding!

572
00:46:48,505 --> 00:46:49,840
Wait…

573
00:46:50,407 --> 00:46:51,742
Where did you say are we going?

574
00:46:52,509 --> 00:46:55,879
We are near the location
our leader and I agreed to meet.

575
00:46:58,715 --> 00:47:00,384
Lucia is still with your group?

576
00:47:02,486 --> 00:47:06,190
I am sure she will be happy
to see you again.

577
00:47:08,058 --> 00:47:09,026
And so will our leader.

578
00:47:11,995 --> 00:47:13,063
Oh, it isn't Lucia?

579
00:47:15,799 --> 00:47:17,401
Our leader is here.

580
00:47:28,445 --> 00:47:29,479
Elias?

581
00:47:32,316 --> 00:47:33,283
Miss…

582
00:47:36,353 --> 00:47:37,654
Impossible…

583
00:47:39,223 --> 00:47:40,290
You're alive?

584
00:47:55,939 --> 00:47:57,808
Why are you crying, Miss Klay?

585
00:48:00,711 --> 00:48:04,281
I owe it to you why I am still here.

586
00:48:04,781 --> 00:48:05,949
Cloth…

587
00:48:06,016 --> 00:48:07,384
I need a lot.

588
00:48:07,451 --> 00:48:09,419
Press it hard on his wound.

589
00:48:10,787 --> 00:48:13,824
Elias, we are doing this
to stop the bleeding.

590
00:48:13,891 --> 00:48:15,459
<i>For as long as you can take it.</i>

591
00:48:16,026 --> 00:48:17,527
And I did, miss.

592
00:48:22,065 --> 00:48:24,434
After I burned the two corpses…

593
00:48:25,702 --> 00:48:28,005
I was able to escape.

594
00:48:28,071 --> 00:48:33,644
Then I met a woman and her niece
who took me to Tiani for my wound to heal.

595
00:48:35,846 --> 00:48:39,316
After a few days,
I returned to the mountains.

596
00:48:39,883 --> 00:48:41,685
There I met Fidel, but…

597
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:46,423
you were already gone.

598
00:48:53,630 --> 00:48:55,065
Many thanks to you

599
00:48:56,600 --> 00:49:01,238
for treating me back then
using Fidel's shirt.

600
00:49:09,746 --> 00:49:14,217
But I finished reading the book.

601
00:49:15,819 --> 00:49:17,654
You should no longer be
in <i>El Filibusterismo.</i>

602
00:49:19,556 --> 00:49:23,060
No offense, but you should be dead by now.

603
00:49:24,061 --> 00:49:25,562
I do not understand.

604
00:49:27,064 --> 00:49:28,665
What are you saying, miss?

605
00:49:35,605 --> 00:49:38,141
If it is true that you are not in <i>El Fili</i>…

606
00:49:44,948 --> 00:49:47,484
It means I did change the story!

607
00:49:50,721 --> 00:49:53,957
And I can still change
the story of <i>El Fili</i>!

608
00:49:59,930 --> 00:50:00,797
Simoun…

609
00:50:01,465 --> 00:50:04,434
We need to find Simoun
at the soonest possible time!

610
00:50:05,902 --> 00:50:06,903
Simoun?

611
00:50:08,138 --> 00:50:13,143
What do you need from the man
who is a known opportunist

612
00:50:13,210 --> 00:50:15,812
and friend of the Spaniards
who are oppressing us?

613
00:50:21,618 --> 00:50:22,686
Are you ready?

614
00:50:54,251 --> 00:50:56,019
<i>How can we get in?</i>

615
00:50:56,086 --> 00:50:58,288
<i>The civil guards are
keeping a close watch.</i>

616
00:50:58,355 --> 00:50:59,923
<i>What do we do now?</i>

617
00:50:59,990 --> 00:51:02,192
I am nervous about
what Father Salvi will do.

618
00:51:02,259 --> 00:51:05,562
<i>Father, if only you came with us
hunting earlier,</i>

619
00:51:05,629 --> 00:51:07,531
we could have already talked about it.

620
00:51:07,597 --> 00:51:13,103
It would have been hard for me
to reveal this to you, Captain General.

621
00:51:13,804 --> 00:51:16,773
You said Miss Klay is here?

622
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:19,342
COMING UP…

623
00:51:19,409 --> 00:51:24,181
If we act now,
we can save the woman you love the most.

624
00:51:24,247 --> 00:51:25,315
Help me!

625
00:51:25,382 --> 00:51:26,583
Help me!

626
00:51:26,650 --> 00:51:27,884
Please!

627
00:51:34,424 --> 00:51:36,893
