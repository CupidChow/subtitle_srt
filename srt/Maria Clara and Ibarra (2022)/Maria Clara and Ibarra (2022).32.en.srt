00:00:27,827 --> 00:00:30,597
MARIA CLARA AND IBARRA

2
00:00:32,365 --> 00:00:36,903
THIS PROGRAM, WHICH IS ADAPTED
FROM THE NOVELS OF DR. JOSE P. RIZAL,

3
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:41,508
IS PRESENTED USING DRAMATIC ELEMENTS
TO CONNECT THE PRESENT AND THE PAST

4
00:00:41,574 --> 00:00:46,379
IN A SPECIAL REIMAGINING OF THE NATIONAL
LITERATURE FILIPINOS ARE PROUD OF.

5
00:00:46,446 --> 00:00:47,747
<i>I'm sorry, my friend.</i>

6
00:00:47,814 --> 00:00:52,886
<i>I did not ask for your permission
in regards to courting your friend.</i>

7
00:00:52,952 --> 00:00:55,855
<i>You do not need my permission, my friend.</i>

8
00:00:55,922 --> 00:00:58,058
<i>You are free to court her as you wish.</i>

9
00:00:58,124 --> 00:01:00,393
I will only ask for one thing.

10
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:04,898
Don't hurt and play
with Miss Klay's heart.

11
00:01:04,964 --> 00:01:05,865
I promise.

12
00:01:05,932 --> 00:01:09,869
<i>Sisa's husband has returned to San Diego.</i>

13
00:01:09,936 --> 00:01:14,374
Did you know that Pedro
is addicted to rooster fights?

14
00:01:14,441 --> 00:01:16,242
<i>It makes me wonder</i>

15
00:01:16,309 --> 00:01:21,214
<i>where he got the money to buy a rooster.</i>

16
00:01:21,281 --> 00:01:23,049
Good morning, Señorita Maria.

17
00:01:23,116 --> 00:01:24,717
The curate asked me to fetch you.

18
00:01:24,784 --> 00:01:29,089
Please tell Friar Salvi
I have important matters to attend to.

19
00:01:29,155 --> 00:01:31,891
He asked me
with complete urgency, señorita.

20
00:01:31,958 --> 00:01:34,727
He said this has something to do
with Señor Crisostomo Ibarra.

21
00:01:34,794 --> 00:01:37,664
Your conversation
with Pilosopo Tasyo got me thinking

22
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:40,400
about the cancer of this town.

23
00:01:40,467 --> 00:01:42,902
What he said also got me thinking.

24
00:01:42,969 --> 00:01:46,573
I tolerated the crooked ways
of the friars, of Father Damaso,

25
00:01:46,639 --> 00:01:49,142
since he is the godfather of my fiancée.

26
00:01:49,209 --> 00:01:50,410
I'm absolutely curious.

27
00:01:50,477 --> 00:01:54,414
Why is Father Damaso so meddlesome

28
00:01:54,481 --> 00:01:57,083
with you and Señorita Maria Clara?

29
00:01:57,150 --> 00:02:00,587
What if I told you that I have with me

30
00:02:00,653 --> 00:02:04,257
a letter from your mother
addressed to Father Damaso?

31
00:02:04,324 --> 00:02:08,094
<i>It's a letter that will bring great shame.</i>

32
00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:10,797
From what I've read in this letter,

33
00:02:10,864 --> 00:02:13,433
Captain Tiago is not your real father.

34
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,903
Your real father is no other than…

35
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:19,973
your beloved godfather.

36
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:22,675
Father Damaso.

37
00:02:23,343 --> 00:02:26,379
PREVIOUSLY…

38
00:02:33,119 --> 00:02:34,020
My goodness.

39
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:36,589
Your Reverence.

40
00:02:37,757 --> 00:02:41,694
You shouldn't be making up lies
against my godfather.

41
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:46,065
He is also a holy disciple of God.

42
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,835
Impossible.

43
00:02:48,902 --> 00:02:51,271
Your accusations are horrific!

44
00:02:51,871 --> 00:02:56,142
But this letter proves
that I am not making this up, Maria.

45
00:03:01,781 --> 00:03:03,583
And for me to read that,

46
00:03:05,251 --> 00:03:07,520
I have to give you Crisostomo's letters.

47
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:11,424
Why are you doing this, Father?

48
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:17,697
To prevent our marriage?

49
00:03:17,764 --> 00:03:21,834
Or to find evidence against Crisostomo

50
00:03:21,901 --> 00:03:27,540
so you can ruin his reputation
before the archbishop?

51
00:03:29,676 --> 00:03:32,912
To prove he does not believe
in God and in the friars?

52
00:03:34,147 --> 00:03:35,315
To prove he's a heretic?

53
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:37,750
Maria Clara, no.

54
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:41,287
Is that what you want, Father?

55
00:03:41,354 --> 00:03:45,391
That's why you want Crisostomo's letters?

56
00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:48,061
To incriminate my fiancé?

57
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:52,865
Son, let's say…

58
00:03:52,932 --> 00:03:57,003
my cousin permits the marriage you want.

59
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:03,109
Who will officiate the wedding
if the priests are against you now?

60
00:04:06,045 --> 00:04:10,850
I wrote a letter to the archbishop
to express my gratitude

61
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:15,955
and to ask him to officiate our wedding.

62
00:04:16,856 --> 00:04:19,158
I trust he will oblige.

63
00:04:21,227 --> 00:04:24,330
Oh, God. Oh, merciful God!

64
00:04:24,998 --> 00:04:27,734
Maria is very lucky indeed.

65
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,569
She will be envied by many.

66
00:04:29,636 --> 00:04:30,470
Can you imagine?

67
00:04:30,536 --> 00:04:34,407
The archbishop himself
will officiate her wedding.

68
00:04:35,475 --> 00:04:39,212
Aside from that,
the captain general also promised

69
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,114
to be our principal sponsor
for our wedding.

70
00:04:42,982 --> 00:04:44,117
Goodness, Crisostomo.

71
00:04:44,183 --> 00:04:47,987
I'm no match for the captain general
and the archbishop.

72
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:51,224
Who am I to refuse?

73
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:55,528
Very well, you have my consent
in marrying my daughter.

74
00:04:56,562 --> 00:05:01,434
Let us do it tomorrow night
so we will have time to prepare.

75
00:05:02,702 --> 00:05:04,637
Thank you so much, Uncle.

76
00:05:22,021 --> 00:05:25,525
If your fiancé is truly a good person…

77
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:29,896
and he is not scheming against us

78
00:05:29,962 --> 00:05:32,799
or the Spanish government,

79
00:05:32,865 --> 00:05:35,168
what is there to worry about

80
00:05:35,234 --> 00:05:38,538
if I read your letters?

81
00:05:38,604 --> 00:05:42,308
In exchange,
I'll give you your mother's letter…

82
00:05:43,376 --> 00:05:47,213
which will prove that Father Damaso
is indeed your real father.

83
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,581
That's enough, Father!

84
00:05:48,648 --> 00:05:52,285
It's painful to think about
but it's the truth.

85
00:05:53,553 --> 00:05:56,589
Your mother died giving birth to you.

86
00:05:56,656 --> 00:06:01,427
That is why the secret
about your identity was never revealed.

87
00:06:05,765 --> 00:06:10,336
Except for this letter I found
in the friar's belongings.

88
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,408
No, Maria.

89
00:06:16,943 --> 00:06:18,211
No.

90
00:06:18,277 --> 00:06:23,049
Either you give me the letters
you've exchanged with Crisostomo…

91
00:06:25,184 --> 00:06:30,823
or this will result in a huge scandal
for Captain Tiago.

92
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:35,094
Your family will be shamed.

93
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:38,564
So just give it to me.

94
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,468
In exchange for this letter

95
00:06:43,202 --> 00:06:46,939
that will surely ruin

96
00:06:47,507 --> 00:06:52,512
the reputation of your fathers
and your whole family.

97
00:06:59,352 --> 00:07:01,821
I will be waiting right here, Maria.

98
00:07:02,822 --> 00:07:04,457
But I'm warning you.

99
00:07:04,991 --> 00:07:07,527
There is a limit to my patience.

100
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:33,619
At last! The wedding is happening!

101
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:37,957
I'm very happy for you
and Maria Clara, sir.

102
00:07:38,024 --> 00:07:40,726
But where are we going anyway?

103
00:07:41,928 --> 00:07:45,832
We will meet with Fidel
because I want him to accompany me.

104
00:07:49,268 --> 00:07:50,870
Goodness, I'll be off then.

105
00:07:51,571 --> 00:07:53,639
I don't want to see that pervert.

106
00:07:53,706 --> 00:07:56,275
He stole a kiss from me.
He's so shameless.

107
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:59,111
My goodness.

108
00:07:59,178 --> 00:08:03,115
If he committed such a shameful act,
then he must give you justice.

109
00:08:04,851 --> 00:08:08,488
He must marry you as soon as possible.

110
00:08:09,755 --> 00:08:13,392
A marriage that I will not refuse.

111
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:17,363
But instead, be in favor of.

112
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:21,501
I am willing to marry her in any church…

113
00:08:24,937 --> 00:08:27,840
and at any given time we'll agree on.

114
00:08:28,407 --> 00:08:29,842
Hey!

115
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:32,545
I am not insane enough to marry you.

116
00:08:33,112 --> 00:08:35,915
I'm not easy, Fidel.

117
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:38,451
Besides, I'm still young.

118
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,353
I still have a lot of dreams in life.

119
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:42,822
You want marriage?

120
00:08:42,889 --> 00:08:44,857
What if I strangle you instead?

121
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:56,168
She's so pretentious.

122
00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:01,607
My friend, I am warning you.
You cannot easily tame…

123
00:09:01,674 --> 00:09:04,210
our fierce and extraordinary friend.

124
00:09:05,678 --> 00:09:08,881
My friend, I tell you,

125
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:15,054
she is the test God gave me in this world.

126
00:09:15,121 --> 00:09:19,425
Even so, I have accepted
that she is the woman I truly love.

127
00:09:20,526 --> 00:09:22,395
So believe me when I say

128
00:09:22,461 --> 00:09:25,798
my intentions are pure
for the stubborn young lady.

129
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:31,971
You are fortunate if she will love you.

130
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,877
Because Ms. Klay is truly special.

131
00:09:38,978 --> 00:09:41,614
She's smart and principled…

132
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:44,517
and hard to match.

133
00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:50,656
I will be very much pleased
if the two of you end up together.

134
00:09:51,657 --> 00:09:54,794
Because both of you
are very precious to me.

135
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:01,300
Let's go.

136
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,041
I'm glad…

137
00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:13,145
you granted Crisostomo's proposal.

138
00:10:13,646 --> 00:10:15,014
Why wouldn't I agree?

139
00:10:15,081 --> 00:10:20,720
The archbishop and the captain general
are both more powerful than Father Damaso.

140
00:10:21,387 --> 00:10:25,658
I just hope Crisostomo won't make
the friars furious anymore.

141
00:10:26,225 --> 00:10:29,362
Let Maria deal with him.

142
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:33,199
They say that a man starts behaving well

143
00:10:33,265 --> 00:10:35,234
once he has a family of his own.

144
00:10:36,268 --> 00:10:37,703
That is true, Cousin.

145
00:10:38,537 --> 00:10:42,475
It's a pity my wife passed away so soon.

146
00:10:43,542 --> 00:10:46,479
I am sure she will be proud
of our daughter.

147
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:48,814
That is true.

148
00:10:48,881 --> 00:10:52,918
<i>We were able to raise her as a
respectful and religious lady.</i>

149
00:11:24,984 --> 00:11:26,185
Maria Clara.

150
00:11:29,121 --> 00:11:30,790
What are you doing here?

151
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:36,228
I was about to go to you
before I leave for Manila.

152
00:11:36,295 --> 00:11:37,496
Is it true…

153
00:11:38,564 --> 00:11:39,665
Godfather?

154
00:11:41,567 --> 00:11:43,869
My respectable godfather.

155
00:11:44,437 --> 00:11:45,504
Maria.

156
00:11:47,106 --> 00:11:48,808
Why are you weeping?

157
00:11:49,642 --> 00:11:51,243
Is it true…

158
00:11:52,611 --> 00:11:54,580
that you are my real father?

159
00:12:07,359 --> 00:12:12,965
And where did you get
that baseless information?

160
00:12:14,767 --> 00:12:16,435
Who told you?

161
00:12:16,502 --> 00:12:18,270
Was it Crisostomo?

162
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:21,874
Do not involve Crisostomo.

163
00:12:22,441 --> 00:12:24,643
If he had nothing to do with it,

164
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:25,644
who told you?

165
00:12:25,711 --> 00:12:27,780
Who is slandering me?

166
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:31,617
Do not ask me who it is.

167
00:12:33,486 --> 00:12:35,020
Just tell me the truth.

168
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:39,391
Are you…

169
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:43,362
my real father?

170
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:58,544
Is that why you're keeping
this a secret from me?

171
00:12:59,745 --> 00:13:01,680
Because this may ruin your reputation?

172
00:13:04,216 --> 00:13:05,518
Then again…

173
00:13:06,986 --> 00:13:11,724
this truth is too sinful.

174
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,196
Don't you dare lie to me, Father.

175
00:13:18,197 --> 00:13:20,399
Especially since we are in
the house of God.

176
00:13:21,567 --> 00:13:23,602
He knows the truth.

177
00:13:25,504 --> 00:13:28,541
So you better start confessing, Father.

178
00:13:30,242 --> 00:13:32,444
Tell me the truth now!

179
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:42,087
You can't…

180
00:13:45,724 --> 00:13:49,261
you can't tell Tiago about this.

181
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:53,132
He will get hurt.

182
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:56,168
Tiago will be hurt.

183
00:13:57,403 --> 00:14:00,072
It will damage his reputation.

184
00:14:03,909 --> 00:14:05,110
Maria.

185
00:14:07,913 --> 00:14:11,617
Everything we worked hard for
will be in vain…

186
00:14:13,252 --> 00:14:16,021
just to give you a good life.

187
00:14:18,824 --> 00:14:21,293
Do you understand, my daughter?

188
00:14:25,731 --> 00:14:27,733
Do you understand?

189
00:14:30,669 --> 00:14:31,837
If that is so…

190
00:14:34,106 --> 00:14:35,341
then it is true?

191
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:41,680
Is it true that you are my real father?

192
00:14:46,986 --> 00:14:49,054
-Come, my child.
-Do not touch me!

193
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:56,695
I cannot believe that my whole being…

194
00:14:57,696 --> 00:15:00,733
is a huge pretense and a lie!

195
00:15:03,369 --> 00:15:06,672
I am the fruit of an immoral relationship!

196
00:15:10,876 --> 00:15:14,480
You all raised me to be God-fearing!

197
00:15:15,347 --> 00:15:17,583
But you…

198
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:21,353
my real father…

199
00:15:23,722 --> 00:15:26,558
You're one sinful friar!

200
00:15:28,494 --> 00:15:32,831
You're just pretending to teach goodness!

201
00:15:39,805 --> 00:15:44,076
I do not want to see
or talk to you ever again.

202
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:51,116
May the Lord curse us all!

203
00:16:57,716 --> 00:16:59,084
So annoying.

204
00:16:59,151 --> 00:17:02,087
<i>I can almost feel
the story's romantic and happy ending</i>

205
00:17:02,154 --> 00:17:03,989
<i>but Fidel started to steal the show.</i>

206
00:17:06,825 --> 00:17:07,993
Maria Clara?

207
00:17:11,263 --> 00:17:12,297
Señorita!

208
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:16,168
What happened to you?

209
00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:19,104
Why are you crying?

210
00:17:19,772 --> 00:17:20,906
Are you alone?

211
00:17:37,456 --> 00:17:40,225
What happened? Why are you crying?

212
00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:44,930
Señorita.

213
00:17:44,997 --> 00:17:46,432
I am your friend.

214
00:17:47,132 --> 00:17:50,169
Tell me, why are you distraught?

215
00:17:50,936 --> 00:17:53,238
Why are you crying?

216
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:59,311
Señor, we will be preparing the meals

217
00:17:59,378 --> 00:18:02,114
you'll be bringing
for your wedding proposal tomorrow.

218
00:18:02,181 --> 00:18:06,985
Again, congratulations
to you and Miss Maria.

219
00:18:09,321 --> 00:18:10,956
Thank you very much, Adong.

220
00:18:11,523 --> 00:18:12,491
All right, señor

221
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:24,169
Señor, someone is looking for you.

222
00:18:25,003 --> 00:18:25,904
Who?

223
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:33,712
Good day, señor.

224
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:38,484
I apologize.

225
00:18:39,051 --> 00:18:41,153
I do not want to put you in danger

226
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,289
but I have something
important to tell you.

227
00:18:50,262 --> 00:18:53,699
Señorita, how can I help you
if you're not talking to me?

228
00:18:57,269 --> 00:18:58,670
I am sorry, Klay.

229
00:19:00,439 --> 00:19:02,774
But no one can help me.

230
00:19:03,842 --> 00:19:05,310
Not even you.

231
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:08,380
So please just let me

232
00:19:08,447 --> 00:19:12,551
keep to myself the things
that are disturbing me.

233
00:19:12,618 --> 00:19:15,420
Señorita, I don't understand.

234
00:19:16,288 --> 00:19:19,491
But whatever it is, don't worry about it.

235
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:23,595
Because Sir Ibarra
already talked to Captain Tiago.

236
00:19:24,396 --> 00:19:27,866
He formally asked for your
father’s permission and he agreed.

237
00:19:27,933 --> 00:19:29,067
So first thing tomorrow,

238
00:19:29,134 --> 00:19:31,670
we'll be at your place to celebrate.

239
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:37,676
Señorita.

240
00:19:38,911 --> 00:19:40,612
Did I say something wrong?

241
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:45,450
Why aren't you happy at all
with his sudden proposal?

242
00:19:46,118 --> 00:19:49,988
Shouldn't you be glad
because you're to be wed to Sir Ibarra?

243
00:19:53,091 --> 00:19:55,460
I am no longer worthy to be with

244
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:59,264
a pure gentleman like Crisostomo.

245
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:04,603
Señorita.

246
00:20:10,108 --> 00:20:12,644
Andeng, where is Maria?

247
00:20:13,812 --> 00:20:15,914
Weren't you two together?

248
00:20:15,981 --> 00:20:17,816
Apologies, señor.

249
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:21,620
She suddenly disappeared
from the church earlier and…

250
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:24,489
Maria!

251
00:20:25,657 --> 00:20:27,259
Where have you been?

252
00:20:29,995 --> 00:20:32,998
Maria, my daughter.
What is the matter with you?

253
00:20:34,032 --> 00:20:35,100
Clarita?

254
00:20:37,002 --> 00:20:40,105
Andeng, please leave us alone.

255
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:46,044
Papa.

256
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:49,514
Please forgive us…

257
00:20:53,518 --> 00:20:56,154
if we have wronged you.

258
00:20:58,523 --> 00:21:00,058
I am sorry, Papa.

259
00:21:03,328 --> 00:21:06,798
What is happening?
Why are you saying that to me?

260
00:21:07,733 --> 00:21:11,203
Tell me. Why are you crying, Clarita?

261
00:21:20,912 --> 00:21:22,347
It's nothing, Auntie.

262
00:21:26,485 --> 00:21:28,920
I just really treasure…

263
00:21:30,722 --> 00:21:35,460
the sacrifices and the love
being given to me…

264
00:21:36,595 --> 00:21:38,196
by my father.

265
00:21:47,372 --> 00:21:49,174
I am very fortunate…

266
00:21:50,108 --> 00:21:54,746
that you've accepted me
and loved me completely.

267
00:21:57,549 --> 00:21:59,918
Thank you very much.

268
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:01,853
Thank you very much, Papa.

269
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:37,823
Sir.

270
00:22:39,124 --> 00:22:43,528
Our people are already asking
for a true reform

271
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:46,431
of the way things are run
by the civil guards,

272
00:22:47,099 --> 00:22:48,400
the friars,

273
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:54,573
and the judges
that must render fair justice to all.

274
00:22:57,642 --> 00:23:01,012
So how do you suggest
this reform be implemented?

275
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:06,084
One example is to make
the Spaniards understand

276
00:23:06,151 --> 00:23:08,854
that they should respect
everyone's dignity,

277
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,255
especially the poor.

278
00:23:10,322 --> 00:23:13,024
They need to lessen
the number of civil guards.

279
00:23:13,992 --> 00:23:18,230
They need to take away the privileges
they utilize for their abuses.

280
00:23:19,531 --> 00:23:20,732
Sir.

281
00:23:22,601 --> 00:23:26,171
You have many friends
that hold high ranks.

282
00:23:27,472 --> 00:23:28,673
If you will oblige,

283
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:32,911
I hope you'll also tell them
what I told you.

284
00:23:38,216 --> 00:23:39,484
Elias.

285
00:23:41,953 --> 00:23:46,858
It is true that our country
seems to be enduring a disease.

286
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:53,298
To cure this,
the government may use methods…

287
00:23:53,365 --> 00:23:57,235
that are painful, yet necessary.

288
00:23:58,403 --> 00:24:03,875
<i>They are making sure that the civil guards
are preventing any crime</i>

289
00:24:04,476 --> 00:24:07,412
<i>through fear and violence.</i>

290
00:24:11,349 --> 00:24:13,251
Do you agree with that, sir?

291
00:24:15,554 --> 00:24:19,191
If you think that's the cure
to this bedridden country,

292
00:24:20,358 --> 00:24:22,027
you are not a very good doctor.

293
00:24:25,197 --> 00:24:28,366
But wouldn't our country be in much danger

294
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:33,705
if we went through with your plan
to weaken the armed forces?

295
00:24:35,073 --> 00:24:36,241
It's true.

296
00:24:37,008 --> 00:24:41,346
We have civil guards.
But what are they doing?

297
00:24:42,214 --> 00:24:43,582
The church is using them

298
00:24:44,583 --> 00:24:49,054
to make false accusations
and imprison people they hate.

299
00:24:56,895 --> 00:24:59,531
Sir, you are aware of this.

300
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:02,267
You are experiencing it right now.

301
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:05,136
And because of this,

302
00:25:05,904 --> 00:25:08,840
more and more people are becoming bandits.

303
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:13,879
<i>Because our countrymen,</i>

304
00:25:13,945 --> 00:25:16,414
<i>especially those who have been oppressed,</i>

305
00:25:16,481 --> 00:25:20,685
<i>have already lost their trust
in the Spanish government.</i>

306
00:25:22,087 --> 00:25:24,422
Some systems are faulty, Elias.

307
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:27,626
But sometimes it's good.

308
00:25:28,426 --> 00:25:31,329
Just think. If there are no civil guards,

309
00:25:31,396 --> 00:25:36,034
we would be attacked every day
by the bandits you mentioned.

310
00:25:36,601 --> 00:25:42,173
Those bandits became criminals
because of hunger!

311
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:45,877
Most of them are victims of abuse.

312
00:25:46,645 --> 00:25:49,881
They are fighting for justice right now.

313
00:25:52,684 --> 00:25:56,321
We need to further investigate
the points you made, Elias.

314
00:25:57,923 --> 00:26:00,158
But if what you're saying is true,

315
00:26:00,992 --> 00:26:03,261
I can write to my friend in Madrid

316
00:26:04,262 --> 00:26:07,999
to ask help from the King of Spain.

317
00:26:09,467 --> 00:26:10,468
Then…

318
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:15,206
I thank you for your kind heart.

319
00:26:17,342 --> 00:26:18,543
Elias.

320
00:26:20,011 --> 00:26:23,214
Even though I grew up in Europe,

321
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:25,216
believe me.

322
00:26:26,851 --> 00:26:30,922
I love this country
because my happiness is here.

323
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:38,363
As for me,

324
00:26:40,198 --> 00:26:42,100
I love this country…

325
00:26:43,735 --> 00:26:46,404
because of the misfortunes
I have dealt with.

326
00:26:49,574 --> 00:26:52,210
If you tell me your life story,

327
00:26:53,645 --> 00:26:57,215
my impression might change
after hearing it.

328
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:02,821
Can you tell me more about your roots?

329
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,534
My grandfather…

330
00:27:19,337 --> 00:27:20,872
was from Manila.

331
00:27:22,173 --> 00:27:25,844
He was working then
for a wealthy Spanish businessman.

332
00:27:27,545 --> 00:27:31,349
But one day, his company burned down.

333
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:35,253
Surrounding houses also caught fire.

334
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:38,690
My grandfather's boss looked
for someone to blame.

335
00:27:41,259 --> 00:27:45,030
<i>My grandfather was reported and punished</i>

336
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:48,366
<i>despite his innocence.</i>

337
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:53,672
<i>Since then,</i>

338
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:58,910
<i>his friends and acquaintances
started avoiding him.</i>

339
00:28:02,313 --> 00:28:07,118
No one would hire him
to work in a decent job.

340
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:09,320
<i>Because of this,</i>

341
00:28:10,255 --> 00:28:13,992
<i>his wife was forced to beg for money.</i>

342
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,595
<i>Not one person tried to help her.</i>

343
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:22,333
<i>Who would believe the wife of an arsonist?</i>

344
00:28:24,402 --> 00:28:25,970
<i>Out of desperation,</i>

345
00:28:26,738 --> 00:28:31,342
<i>my grandmother was forced
to sell her body.</i>

346
00:28:34,245 --> 00:28:36,314
<i>And because of the humiliation,</i>

347
00:28:37,015 --> 00:28:39,651
<i>my family lived in the mountains.</i>

348
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:42,787
<i>To be far away from gossipers</i>

349
00:28:43,988 --> 00:28:45,824
<i>and those who oppress others.</i>

350
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:48,159
<i>But one day…</i>

351
00:29:02,373 --> 00:29:06,711
<i>My father found my grandfather lifeless.</i>

352
00:29:13,084 --> 00:29:17,455
<i>My father also witnessed
my grandmother's death…</i>

353
00:29:18,923 --> 00:29:20,792
<i>because of extreme resentment.</i>

354
00:29:25,396 --> 00:29:27,799
Since my father became an orphan,

355
00:29:28,466 --> 00:29:30,635
he went to different places.

356
00:29:31,736 --> 00:29:35,206
Until he found work in a large estate.

357
00:29:36,841 --> 00:29:38,243
<i>And there,</i>

358
00:29:39,043 --> 00:29:41,012
<i>my father fell in love…</i>

359
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:45,416
<i>with a rich man's daughter.</i>

360
00:29:51,489 --> 00:29:52,757
<i>She was my mother.</i>

361
00:29:56,127 --> 00:30:00,098
My father was able to experience
a glimpse of hope and love

362
00:30:00,165 --> 00:30:01,299
because of my mother,

363
00:30:01,866 --> 00:30:06,871
but her rich family
was against their relationship.

364
00:30:08,173 --> 00:30:11,409
They had my father arrested
and imprisoned.

365
00:30:13,111 --> 00:30:16,114
We've never gotten to know him.

366
00:30:16,881 --> 00:30:18,216
<i>However…</i>

367
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:22,987
<i>my mother gave birth to twins.</i>

368
00:30:24,455 --> 00:30:27,625
<i>That was me and my sister.</i>

369
00:30:31,696 --> 00:30:33,598
Just like my father back then,

370
00:30:34,933 --> 00:30:36,201
somehow…

371
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:41,573
I was able to experience a bit
of comfort and luxury in life

372
00:30:41,639 --> 00:30:44,008
because of my family's wealth.

373
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:49,747
But it seems like a curse
keeps flowing in my blood.

374
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:55,353
When our wealthy grandfather died,

375
00:30:56,621 --> 00:31:00,124
we did not have any papers to prove

376
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:02,694
that we were related to him.

377
00:31:03,394 --> 00:31:06,297
We were disowned by our own clan.

378
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:17,775
My sibling and I
experienced the misfortune

379
00:31:17,842 --> 00:31:22,480
we've inherited from our father
and his father.

380
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:31,189
Our misfortune continued
living on with them.

381
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:34,792
When our father introduced himself to us,

382
00:31:37,595 --> 00:31:41,432
I learned the whole story of our lineage.

383
00:31:47,939 --> 00:31:51,409
That our misfortune started from…

384
00:31:51,943 --> 00:31:54,612
a rich Spanish businessman…

385
00:31:55,713 --> 00:31:57,882
who punished my grandfather.

386
00:31:58,383 --> 00:32:02,553
Where's your father and twin sister now?

387
00:32:09,894 --> 00:32:13,097
My father died from an illness.

388
00:32:14,165 --> 00:32:16,601
My twin on the other hand…

389
00:32:16,668 --> 00:32:20,071
was killed by an unidentified man

390
00:32:20,138 --> 00:32:24,175
because no civil guard
wanted to investigate.

391
00:32:26,577 --> 00:32:28,012
My Lord.

392
00:32:31,983 --> 00:32:34,218
Just like our countrymen,

393
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:37,622
what happened to my family
is not out of the ordinary.

394
00:32:37,689 --> 00:32:40,992
We're so used to accept…

395
00:32:42,026 --> 00:32:44,729
that this is the world we live in.

396
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:50,001
But for the two of us,

397
00:32:52,236 --> 00:32:54,772
are we simply ordinary individuals?

398
00:32:57,275 --> 00:32:58,743
Elias.

399
00:32:58,810 --> 00:32:59,944
That's why…

400
00:33:00,878 --> 00:33:04,449
you cannot blame me
if I do not trust the Spaniards

401
00:33:04,515 --> 00:33:05,650
and the civil guards.

402
00:33:06,851 --> 00:33:08,419
To tell you the truth,

403
00:33:10,021 --> 00:33:11,956
I truly believe…

404
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:16,561
each family in this country
can achieve justice

405
00:33:16,627 --> 00:33:19,464
if we don't allow ourselves
to be conquered by the Spaniards!

406
00:33:20,264 --> 00:33:23,468
Fighting them will help us
gain our freedom!

407
00:33:23,534 --> 00:33:27,338
But revolution will not give you
the reform you wanted!

408
00:33:28,539 --> 00:33:29,607
Sir.

409
00:33:30,608 --> 00:33:32,243
Without revolution,

410
00:33:33,077 --> 00:33:34,645
there won't be freedom.

411
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:39,183
This country will continue
to live in the dark.

412
00:33:41,452 --> 00:33:45,556
I will never join that kind of movement.

413
00:33:53,197 --> 00:33:54,465
If that is so,

414
00:33:56,667 --> 00:33:58,002
we are not the same.

415
00:34:00,738 --> 00:34:02,106
But remember this.

416
00:34:03,775 --> 00:34:07,845
As long as every family in this country
is in the hands of the Spaniards,

417
00:34:08,746 --> 00:34:11,115
you will never be happy and peaceful.

418
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:14,852
You will gain more enemies!

419
00:34:14,919 --> 00:34:19,991
And I assure you they won't stop
until they destroy all your dreams.

420
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:22,393
They will destroy and kill you.

421
00:34:23,494 --> 00:34:25,496
Just like my forefathers.

422
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:28,299
Just like my kin.

423
00:34:29,934 --> 00:34:31,502
Just like your father.

424
00:34:33,805 --> 00:34:36,040
You will end up just like them.

425
00:35:06,337 --> 00:35:07,738
Cousin.

426
00:35:08,706 --> 00:35:11,342
Don't you think
we should tell Father Damaso

427
00:35:11,409 --> 00:35:14,212
about Ibarra's wedding proposal tomorrow?

428
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:19,650
Don't you think he'll get angry
if he finds out after it's all done?

429
00:35:20,418 --> 00:35:21,953
Even if he gets angry,

430
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:23,554
what else can he do

431
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:26,724
with the captain general
and the archbishop on our side?

432
00:35:28,192 --> 00:35:30,661
I am much more worried about Maria.

433
00:35:34,165 --> 00:35:35,333
Isabel.

434
00:35:36,834 --> 00:35:42,306
Aren't you wondering why she
was crying so hard when she arrived?

435
00:35:43,508 --> 00:35:46,277
Wasn't she acting a bit strange?

436
00:35:46,911 --> 00:35:48,279
You're right.

437
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:51,782
But for now, the important thing is

438
00:35:51,849 --> 00:35:55,720
to talk about the engagement tomorrow.

439
00:35:55,786 --> 00:35:58,189
Don't worry, I will talk to her.

440
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:03,861
What food do you think
I should ask the servants to prepare?

441
00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:11,169
Señor, the food for tomorrow is all ready.

442
00:36:11,235 --> 00:36:13,371
Your architect also dropped by.

443
00:36:13,437 --> 00:36:15,106
He wanted to talk to you

444
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:18,176
regarding the additional materials
for your school.

445
00:36:18,242 --> 00:36:19,477
If that is so,

446
00:36:19,544 --> 00:36:23,281
I will visit him right away
tomorrow morning.

447
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:24,682
Very well.

448
00:36:27,218 --> 00:36:28,352
Thank you.

449
00:36:40,331 --> 00:36:41,632
Sir Ibarra!

450
00:36:43,134 --> 00:36:44,335
Wait.

451
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:49,073
There is something you should
know about Maria Clara.

452
00:36:50,174 --> 00:36:52,944
I saw her earlier, crying profusely.

453
00:36:55,446 --> 00:36:56,714
Did she say why?

454
00:36:58,182 --> 00:36:59,517
That's the thing, sir.

455
00:36:59,584 --> 00:37:02,420
No matter how hard I try,
she never tells me why.

456
00:37:04,355 --> 00:37:06,557
I must talk to her then.

457
00:37:06,624 --> 00:37:08,059
Wait.

458
00:37:08,125 --> 00:37:09,627
I will take care of it.

459
00:37:10,127 --> 00:37:12,363
I'll visit her first thing in the morning.

460
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:14,699
I'll try to talk her out of it.

461
00:37:15,666 --> 00:37:18,069
You should focus on your school project

462
00:37:18,135 --> 00:37:20,638
so you won't be late
for your engagement tomorrow.

463
00:37:25,643 --> 00:37:28,312
We still have so many things to do
regarding the engagement.

464
00:37:31,682 --> 00:37:33,751
Thank you very much, Ms. Klay.

465
00:37:35,486 --> 00:37:37,655
You are heaven-sent to me.

466
00:37:49,533 --> 00:37:51,002
You got it all wrong.

467
00:37:51,068 --> 00:37:52,770
Heaven did not send me.

468
00:37:53,337 --> 00:37:56,240
It was Mr. Torres who brought me here.

469
00:37:57,675 --> 00:38:01,812
Which reminds me,
when is he going to show up again?

470
00:38:03,381 --> 00:38:05,049
It's almost the end.
A wedding is coming up.

471
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:08,719
Isn't this usually the end
in soap operas--

472
00:38:13,491 --> 00:38:14,792
Is it really ending?

473
00:38:18,929 --> 00:38:21,565
Is the wedding
really going to push through?

474
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:26,671
No love will ever triumph
in a tumultuous society.

475
00:38:33,844 --> 00:38:37,181
No, their love story is not tragic.

476
00:38:38,349 --> 00:38:41,752
I'm sure it has nothing to do
with what Maria Clara was crying about.

477
00:38:45,356 --> 00:38:49,393
I hope the sun rises now
so I can go to her.

478
00:39:10,581 --> 00:39:12,983
Where are my letters?

479
00:39:20,157 --> 00:39:21,759
Where are those…

480
00:39:22,827 --> 00:39:25,529
stupid letters?

481
00:39:35,005 --> 00:39:36,540
Father.

482
00:39:36,607 --> 00:39:39,410
I thought your carriage had left already.

483
00:39:42,646 --> 00:39:44,715
Something is missing.

484
00:39:46,417 --> 00:39:49,253
One of my letters is missing.

485
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:52,123
Which letter is missing?

486
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:57,661
What do you mean, Father?

487
00:39:58,729 --> 00:40:02,933
You are a demon in disguise.

488
00:40:03,701 --> 00:40:05,136
Traitor!

489
00:40:05,202 --> 00:40:08,839
Why, Father? Please calm down.

490
00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:12,943
-Calm down.
-Where are my letters?

491
00:40:15,446 --> 00:40:20,651
And who told you to share
and reveal its contents?

492
00:40:20,718 --> 00:40:22,553
Good Lord.

493
00:40:23,621 --> 00:40:27,458
What letters are you talking about?

494
00:40:28,392 --> 00:40:32,363
What do they contain for you
to be this angry?

495
00:40:32,997 --> 00:40:36,267
Father, please. Calm down.

496
00:40:36,333 --> 00:40:38,903
We are allies.

497
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:44,809
Why don't you tell me
the content of those letters

498
00:40:44,875 --> 00:40:47,244
so I can help you find them?

499
00:40:49,313 --> 00:40:53,484
Just make sure you have nothing to do

500
00:40:53,551 --> 00:40:57,054
or know anything about those things.

501
00:40:57,121 --> 00:40:59,557
If I found out you're behind this,

502
00:40:59,623 --> 00:41:05,729
if you ever stab me in the back
despite putting up with you for so long,

503
00:41:07,231 --> 00:41:11,535
consider me as your worst enemy!

504
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:15,172
That's all you need to know.

505
00:41:56,780 --> 00:42:01,385
This will result in a huge scandal
for Captain Tiago.

506
00:42:01,452 --> 00:42:02,686
So just give it to me.

507
00:42:02,753 --> 00:42:05,055
In exchange for this letter
that will surely ruin

508
00:42:05,122 --> 00:42:09,827
the reputation of your fathers
and your whole family.

509
00:42:10,861 --> 00:42:11,962
My God.

510
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:18,068
Please guide me in making my decision.

511
00:42:20,971 --> 00:42:24,842
Should I give these letters
in exchange for my mother's?

512
00:43:07,184 --> 00:43:08,586
Well, native…

513
00:43:09,353 --> 00:43:11,121
what are you doing here?

514
00:43:11,188 --> 00:43:13,290
Did Maria send you?

515
00:43:14,124 --> 00:43:15,859
Did she give something for me?

516
00:43:16,994 --> 00:43:18,095
None, Father.

517
00:43:18,963 --> 00:43:24,134
But, I bring news
that will surely anger you

518
00:43:24,201 --> 00:43:25,235
and Father Damaso.

519
00:43:25,970 --> 00:43:26,870
What is it?

520
00:43:28,505 --> 00:43:30,574
Later tonight,

521
00:43:31,575 --> 00:43:34,878
a formal engagement is to be held
by Sir Ibarra for my lady.

522
00:43:35,679 --> 00:43:37,348
Their wedding will push through.

523
00:43:38,015 --> 00:43:39,883
This is a curse from God!

524
00:44:05,909 --> 00:44:10,547
My friend, there is something
I want to know about Ms. Klay.

525
00:44:10,614 --> 00:44:13,484
It seems that you have fallen

526
00:44:13,550 --> 00:44:16,253
for a stranger who came into our lives.

527
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:18,956
<i>I will speak to Crisostomo.</i>

528
00:44:19,523 --> 00:44:23,293
There are things I need to confess to him.

529
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:24,895
Confess what?

530
00:44:27,264 --> 00:44:28,465
Sisa, this is Fidel.

531
00:44:29,633 --> 00:44:32,636
-Sisa, why are you here?
-Enough!

532
00:44:32,703 --> 00:44:36,573
<i>Please tell Crisostomo
to cancel our engagement.</i>

533
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:38,742
I have no honor left to face him.

534
00:44:38,809 --> 00:44:41,745
I really don't understand.
What is really happening?

535
00:44:41,812 --> 00:44:44,148
<i>Just tell him I love him very much.</i>

536
00:44:44,214 --> 00:44:46,316
Sir, could it be that she was threatened

537
00:44:46,383 --> 00:44:50,788
and prohibited by Father Damaso
from marrying you?

538
00:44:50,854 --> 00:44:53,390
COMING UP…

539
00:44:58,295 --> 00:45:01,532
