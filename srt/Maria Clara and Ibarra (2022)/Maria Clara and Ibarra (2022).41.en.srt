00:00:28,395 --> 00:00:30,964
MARIA CLARA AND IBARRA

2
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:35,568
THIS PROGRAM, WHICH IS ADAPTED
FROM THE NOVELS OF DR. JOSE P. RIZAL,

3
00:00:35,635 --> 00:00:40,573
IS PRESENTED USING DRAMATIC ELEMENTS
TO CONNECT THE PRESENT AND THE PAST

4
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:45,945
IN A SPECIAL REIMAGINING OF THE NATIONAL
LITERATURE FILIPINOS ARE PROUD OF.

5
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:47,847
<i>My sympathies, kid.</i>

6
00:00:47,914 --> 00:00:49,849
<i>Our lives have become tragic.</i>

7
00:00:49,916 --> 00:00:50,784
<i>But you.</i>

8
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:54,120
<i>You have a chance to live a better life.</i>

9
00:00:54,187 --> 00:00:55,188
<i>Your wound is deep.</i>

10
00:00:55,255 --> 00:00:56,856
Let's go back to our camp in the woods.

11
00:00:56,923 --> 00:00:59,726
My time has come, my friend. Leave me now.

12
00:00:59,793 --> 00:01:01,561
<i>Save yourselves.</i>

13
00:01:01,628 --> 00:01:03,396
<i>We found two corpses.</i>

14
00:01:03,463 --> 00:01:05,999
<i>We found this beside one of the bodies.</i>

15
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:09,402
<i>Captain Tiago said he knows who owns it.</i>

16
00:01:09,969 --> 00:01:12,772
Crisostomo!

17
00:01:12,839 --> 00:01:14,908
<i>It looks like Elias burned himself.</i>

18
00:01:14,974 --> 00:01:16,076
Why would he do that?

19
00:01:16,142 --> 00:01:18,478
Perhaps to confuse the authorities.

20
00:01:18,545 --> 00:01:20,580
You mean Ibarra hasn't been found yet?

21
00:01:20,647 --> 00:01:24,084
You need to accept that Crisostomo Ibarra
might be presumed dead.

22
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:28,088
What did you do to ruin Crisostomo's life?

23
00:01:28,154 --> 00:01:32,926
<i>Now tell me who the real sinner is
and who deserves to die.</i>

24
00:01:32,992 --> 00:01:35,428
<i>Class is over.
It's time to go back to our world.</i>

25
00:01:35,495 --> 00:01:37,397
<i>This is where Rizal ended the story.</i>

26
00:01:37,464 --> 00:01:39,999
<i>Will the uprising push through?</i>

27
00:01:40,066 --> 00:01:42,135
<i>Or are we going to keep
submitting forever?</i>

28
00:01:42,202 --> 00:01:44,437
You might find the answers
to your questions

29
00:01:44,504 --> 00:01:45,772
in <i>El Filibusterismo</i>.

30
00:01:45,839 --> 00:01:48,608
I am just a messenger of the truth.

31
00:01:48,675 --> 00:01:50,276
What truth?

32
00:01:50,343 --> 00:01:52,979
You are not Maria's real father.

33
00:01:53,046 --> 00:01:54,280
But your dear friend.

34
00:01:54,347 --> 00:01:58,151
-Father Damaso.
-Perhaps I should be thankful

35
00:01:58,218 --> 00:02:00,120
if you were to kill me now.

36
00:02:00,186 --> 00:02:04,090
<i>It's not fair to end
the suffering you're speaking of.</i>

37
00:02:04,157 --> 00:02:06,092
<i>May God curse you!</i>

38
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:07,026
<i>Forgive me.</i>

39
00:02:07,093 --> 00:02:10,930
You don't deserve a weak father like me.

40
00:02:10,997 --> 00:02:14,033
You already did so much for me.

41
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:17,137
You're my greatest blessing, Maria Clara.

42
00:02:17,203 --> 00:02:20,440
<i>-I love you so much.
-I love you too, Papa.</i>

43
00:02:20,507 --> 00:02:22,842
<i>Where are you going?
Why is everyone crying?</i>

44
00:02:22,909 --> 00:02:24,577
<i>Were you not informed, Klay?</i>

45
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:27,981
<i>You have got it all wrong.
Sir Ibarra is alive.</i>

46
00:02:28,047 --> 00:02:29,682
Then where is he?

47
00:02:29,749 --> 00:02:31,951
<i>I know he will come back.</i>

48
00:02:32,018 --> 00:02:33,553
I am completely worn out.

49
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:35,722
That is why I need peace.

50
00:02:35,788 --> 00:02:38,591
What if you don't enter the convent?

51
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:40,593
Would you like to come with me?

52
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,829
-Where to?
-To my world.

53
00:02:42,896 --> 00:02:46,232
PREVIOUSLY…

54
00:02:49,135 --> 00:02:50,603
Klay, what world do you speak of?

55
00:02:56,976 --> 00:02:58,444
Year…

56
00:03:00,146 --> 00:03:03,416
two thousand and twenty-two.

57
00:03:05,752 --> 00:03:08,254
A world hundreds of years from now.

58
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:12,325
How I wish I could laugh right now

59
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:15,495
but even that has vanished within me.

60
00:03:17,397 --> 00:03:19,232
I'm serious.

61
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:22,001
Come with me.

62
00:03:23,002 --> 00:03:24,404
My world is…

63
00:03:25,638 --> 00:03:26,940
progressive.

64
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,577
More opportunities await us there.

65
00:03:32,812 --> 00:03:35,415
Don't you want to live in a world
where you won't be dictated

66
00:03:35,481 --> 00:03:37,417
based on your gender?

67
00:03:39,085 --> 00:03:43,256
Where I'm from, you can do anything.

68
00:03:51,664 --> 00:03:54,067
I think what you're referring to
is paradise.

69
00:04:01,841 --> 00:04:05,178
I'm not sure if I can call
my world a paradise.

70
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:09,349
Because if only you knew,
it has its imperfections too.

71
00:04:11,484 --> 00:04:14,454
It's like we never learned anything
from this period.

72
00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:20,093
But there are developments somehow.

73
00:04:20,627 --> 00:04:23,263
And life there is better.

74
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:27,100
We can do so much together there.

75
00:04:28,568 --> 00:04:30,703
So come with me!

76
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:35,475
I cannot escape my destiny, my namesake.

77
00:04:38,311 --> 00:04:39,779
I have accepted

78
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:45,652
that I was cursed
to be born in this world…

79
00:04:50,723 --> 00:04:55,728
to pay for the consequence
of how I came to be.

80
00:04:58,131 --> 00:04:59,966
If there is still some hope left,

81
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:04,704
even just a little for me…

82
00:05:10,276 --> 00:05:14,380
I would offer it all to the Lord

83
00:05:15,848 --> 00:05:19,285
or on the chance
that I may meet Crisostomo again

84
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:25,458
and we will be together in life.

85
00:05:26,626 --> 00:05:28,227
Or in death.

86
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:37,270
I cannot use the hope
that's left within me

87
00:05:39,872 --> 00:05:42,608
to wish for a new start in your world.

88
00:05:46,546 --> 00:05:48,114
Or anywhere else.

89
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,328
Are you sure?

90
00:06:06,632 --> 00:06:11,371
Somehow in this world I'm born in,

91
00:06:14,474 --> 00:06:21,180
a connection exists
between Crisostomo and me.

92
00:06:30,656 --> 00:06:32,058
Clarita.

93
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:35,094
There are still preparations to be done

94
00:06:35,161 --> 00:06:37,830
for your journey
to the convent of Santa Clara.

95
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:40,566
It will be dusk soon.

96
00:06:40,633 --> 00:06:41,534
Wait.

97
00:06:43,269 --> 00:06:45,104
Not you, señora.

98
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:49,542
"Dusk."

99
00:06:49,609 --> 00:06:52,178
Before dusk hits tomorrow,

100
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:55,615
whether you like it or not,
your time is up.

101
00:06:58,951 --> 00:07:00,420
Is this real?

102
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,659
Is this farewell?

103
00:07:08,127 --> 00:07:09,362
Klay.

104
00:08:25,905 --> 00:08:27,173
Señor.

105
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:30,643
Where are we going?

106
00:08:49,795 --> 00:08:52,131
We will leave this town for now.

107
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:20,893
Forgive us for looking at your…

108
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,094
chest cover.

109
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:30,303
I left a chest cover for you
in my old room.

110
00:09:31,203 --> 00:09:32,371
Do you remember?

111
00:09:33,372 --> 00:09:36,309
Yeah! Take it with you to the convent.

112
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:39,579
Show it to the girls there.
You'll be the only girl who has one.

113
00:09:42,481 --> 00:09:44,550
It's my remembrance to you.

114
00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:52,625
I finally brought back
the smile on your face.

115
00:09:58,631 --> 00:10:00,900
I've kept a piece of you in here.

116
00:10:03,235 --> 00:10:04,470
In my heart.

117
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:15,147
And no matter what, you'll always be here.

118
00:10:19,218 --> 00:10:20,419
<i>I promise I won't tell.</i>

119
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,922
This will be our secret.

120
00:10:22,989 --> 00:10:26,525
Just promise me
you won't get caught by Doña Isabel,

121
00:10:26,592 --> 00:10:29,662
by your father,
and especially by your godfather.

122
00:10:29,729 --> 00:10:31,664
<i>Thank you for sharing this with me.</i>

123
00:10:31,731 --> 00:10:33,065
That's your book, señorita.

124
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:35,001
What I mean is that…

125
00:10:36,168 --> 00:10:40,239
I find your vast knowledge admirable.

126
00:10:41,574 --> 00:10:43,442
Are we besties now?

127
00:10:44,377 --> 00:10:46,946
I want to be besties.

128
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:53,953
You are slowly learning
to make decisions for yourself.

129
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:56,188
<i>You are not showing horns, Maria Clara.</i>

130
00:10:56,255 --> 00:10:58,958
<i>You are spreading your wings.</i>

131
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:02,895
<i>Welcome to our home, Klay.</i>

132
00:11:06,265 --> 00:11:08,100
<i>You're so beautiful, my namesake.</i>

133
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:10,503
Thank you so much for everything.

134
00:11:11,203 --> 00:11:12,905
<i>Take care, okay?</i>

135
00:11:21,981 --> 00:11:26,485
Even if we have chosen
to take on two different worlds,

136
00:11:30,489 --> 00:11:32,892
if fate will allow,

137
00:11:34,226 --> 00:11:35,561
we will see each other again.

138
00:11:38,764 --> 00:11:40,833
Love will find a way.

139
00:11:51,143 --> 00:11:53,112
I love you so much--

140
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:28,080
I love you so much too, Maria Clara.

141
00:12:36,989 --> 00:12:38,591
Safe travels…

142
00:12:40,192 --> 00:12:41,460
my namesake,

143
00:12:42,361 --> 00:12:43,763
my sister,

144
00:12:44,997 --> 00:12:46,265
my friend.

145
00:12:50,703 --> 00:12:52,738
I will never forget you.

146
00:12:56,475 --> 00:12:58,043
Me too!

147
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:01,847
I will always remember you.

148
00:13:02,648 --> 00:13:04,784
And this whole town.

149
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:11,290
Your love story with Sir Ibarra
is my favorite.

150
00:13:12,491 --> 00:13:13,425
Klay.

151
00:13:14,894 --> 00:13:16,395
Okay, I'm going.

152
00:13:35,381 --> 00:13:37,483
Thank you so much.

153
00:13:40,219 --> 00:13:41,921
Because of you,

154
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:48,127
Maria Clara's world is brighter now.

155
00:13:57,937 --> 00:14:00,973
I always knew you would like me!

156
00:14:16,455 --> 00:14:17,957
Take care of yourself.

157
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:25,491
We're still far from the camp.

158
00:15:28,827 --> 00:15:30,162
Why are we here?

159
00:15:37,036 --> 00:15:40,239
This town will prosper one day, Miss Klay.

160
00:15:40,806 --> 00:15:44,176
Especially if the children here
can all go to school.

161
00:15:44,243 --> 00:15:47,980
Because their generation
will uplift San Diego.

162
00:15:49,648 --> 00:15:53,385
This town will be the role model
of every town in the Philippines.

163
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:56,989
What I wanted to say is you showed me

164
00:15:57,489 --> 00:15:59,858
that a man can be caring.

165
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,095
So, thank you.

166
00:16:03,829 --> 00:16:06,598
You have restored my faith in men.

167
00:16:14,506 --> 00:16:16,809
I came all the way here

168
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:20,446
so I can say goodbye to Ibarra…

169
00:16:22,614 --> 00:16:24,650
for the last time.

170
00:16:28,087 --> 00:16:31,056
<i>Love is what's keeping you in this world.</i>

171
00:16:32,057 --> 00:16:36,495
And it’s love that will help you finish
the story so you can go home.

172
00:16:46,638 --> 00:16:48,140
I thought…

173
00:16:49,775 --> 00:16:51,377
I thought…

174
00:16:52,277 --> 00:16:56,582
my love for one person is the only thing
that was keeping me from leaving.

175
00:16:59,618 --> 00:17:02,721
Turns out he wasn't referring
to that kind of love alone.

176
00:17:31,183 --> 00:17:34,053
Okay, press it firmly in his wound.

177
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:36,355
Harder!

178
00:17:37,856 --> 00:17:40,626
Elias, we're doing this
to stop the bleeding.

179
00:17:40,692 --> 00:17:42,061
I will die…

180
00:17:45,497 --> 00:17:51,870
without witnessing the break of dawn…

181
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:55,107
in this country.

182
00:17:55,174 --> 00:17:58,544
But I was saved by your love.

183
00:18:16,028 --> 00:18:17,396
I love you so much--

184
00:18:30,809 --> 00:18:34,146
I love you so much too, Maria Clara.

185
00:18:45,991 --> 00:18:48,393
It hurts to love in this town!

186
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:02,274
Perhaps if I go back to town now,

187
00:19:03,709 --> 00:19:08,547
I will only be faced
with accusations and judgment.

188
00:19:11,617 --> 00:19:15,053
I no longer want my old life back, miss.

189
00:19:17,856 --> 00:19:21,360
After what I have seen, experienced…

190
00:19:23,862 --> 00:19:25,364
and done.

191
00:19:27,933 --> 00:19:32,804
But you have connections and lawyers
who will defend you, right?

192
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:35,807
And what about your businesses?

193
00:19:39,645 --> 00:19:41,647
In just a short time, Miss Klay…

194
00:19:42,781 --> 00:19:44,950
I began to slowly see

195
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:49,288
the poor and oppressed.

196
00:20:09,975 --> 00:20:13,612
Those of you who can still see,
welcome it.

197
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:16,181
Never forget what toppled down

198
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:18,450
in the dark of night.

199
00:20:19,685 --> 00:20:21,453
But they are still fighting

200
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:24,523
in hopes of change.

201
00:20:27,426 --> 00:20:30,262
I suppose this is my chance to use

202
00:20:31,196 --> 00:20:32,798
my remaining wealth.

203
00:20:36,969 --> 00:20:39,504
Are you still the same Fidel I met before?

204
00:20:44,543 --> 00:20:46,612
Allow me to introduce myself.

205
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:50,349
I am Fidel Reyes y Maglipol.

206
00:20:51,483 --> 00:20:52,918
And you are?

207
00:20:53,719 --> 00:20:55,487
Maria Clara Infantes.

208
00:20:55,554 --> 00:20:58,423
Where do you live by the way?

209
00:21:02,361 --> 00:21:04,029
Before I met you, Miss Klay…

210
00:21:06,865 --> 00:21:08,567
my life had no direction.

211
00:21:10,168 --> 00:21:13,605
It was full of self-indulgence.

212
00:21:14,673 --> 00:21:16,842
I was privileged.

213
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:19,578
I did not care about my own town.

214
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:24,116
I was selfish, Miss Klay.

215
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:26,551
I know that.

216
00:21:29,488 --> 00:21:30,756
But…

217
00:21:34,259 --> 00:21:37,462
from the moment you landed here,

218
00:21:39,531 --> 00:21:41,366
I changed.

219
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:47,306
Landed, really?

220
00:21:47,372 --> 00:21:48,774
What am I? A virus?

221
00:21:53,011 --> 00:21:57,182
It seems that the disease
and defects of this town

222
00:21:57,249 --> 00:21:58,684
have also reached me.

223
00:22:01,353 --> 00:22:03,255
You changed me, Miss Klay.

224
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:06,825
Because of you,

225
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:12,998
I am done pretending
that this town is doing fine.

226
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:16,735
And like you,

227
00:22:17,536 --> 00:22:21,873
I also want to cure this ailing town

228
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:24,142
while there is still time.

229
00:22:37,489 --> 00:22:38,857
Miss Klay.

230
00:22:41,093 --> 00:22:42,794
Join me.

231
00:22:44,596 --> 00:22:50,168
Let's continue what Crisostomo
and Elias started together.

232
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:08,587
I can't, Fidel.

233
00:23:10,789 --> 00:23:13,191
I have to go.

234
00:23:17,863 --> 00:23:19,631
And where will you go?

235
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,235
Time for me to go back.

236
00:23:24,469 --> 00:23:26,338
To my real world.

237
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,909
That's also why we are here.

238
00:23:35,881 --> 00:23:38,316
Because I wanted to say goodbye.

239
00:23:42,454 --> 00:23:45,123
This is the last time
we'll be seeing each other, Fidel.

240
00:23:47,192 --> 00:23:49,594
What are you trying to say, Miss Klay?

241
00:23:54,032 --> 00:23:58,103
When we arrive in Manila,
we will go our separate ways.

242
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:01,506
You will start your new life.

243
00:24:03,074 --> 00:24:04,943
Where will I go there?

244
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:10,248
You can go to Binondo.

245
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:13,919
To the stone house of the Delo Santos'.

246
00:24:15,987 --> 00:24:20,325
Just tell their caretaker
that you are from San Diego

247
00:24:20,392 --> 00:24:22,127
and you're there for work.

248
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:24,930
"Delos Santos."

249
00:24:26,097 --> 00:24:28,834
At Captain Tiago's house in Manila?

250
00:24:33,004 --> 00:24:35,040
Try to get in there for now.

251
00:24:36,675 --> 00:24:38,910
I think it will be best for you.

252
00:24:41,179 --> 00:24:44,616
Just don't tell anyone we've talked.

253
00:24:46,084 --> 00:24:47,452
And that I am still alive.

254
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:53,725
By the way,

255
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:58,997
I hope this will help you
start your new life.

256
00:25:06,605 --> 00:25:08,473
I cannot accept this.

257
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:11,309
This is a huge sum.

258
00:25:12,544 --> 00:25:16,681
That's nothing compared
to what you had to endure.

259
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:24,055
Thank you very much, Señor Ibarra.

260
00:25:25,056 --> 00:25:26,925
Even if my mother is gone,

261
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:30,061
she is still looking after me.

262
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:35,867
She gave me an angel like you.

263
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:43,041
We have to go now.

264
00:25:46,144 --> 00:25:48,380
When we get to Manila…

265
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:52,083
what is your plan, señor?

266
00:25:53,351 --> 00:25:57,589
I'm going somewhere far
to gather strength.

267
00:25:59,257 --> 00:26:01,426
I will be back in due time.

268
00:26:09,701 --> 00:26:11,736
Where are you going?

269
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:19,544
Wherever the wind and water will take me.

270
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:31,756
I told you I am not from here.

271
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:36,795
I told you the truth.

272
00:26:38,363 --> 00:26:42,100
I was not making a fool out of you.

273
00:26:43,635 --> 00:26:46,338
My world is different from yours.

274
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:49,541
Is this the book you were telling me?

275
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:56,548
That we are all mere characters of that…

276
00:26:56,615 --> 00:26:57,682
that Rizal?

277
00:27:00,185 --> 00:27:01,620
And you…

278
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:05,590
you are a real person from another…

279
00:27:06,191 --> 00:27:07,926
another time.

280
00:27:10,729 --> 00:27:12,030
And that…

281
00:27:13,031 --> 00:27:16,334
And that time I saw you
talking to yourself,

282
00:27:16,401 --> 00:27:18,370
when you wanted to go home was--

283
00:27:18,436 --> 00:27:20,939
I know you don't believe me.

284
00:27:23,241 --> 00:27:25,076
I believe you.

285
00:27:26,111 --> 00:27:27,779
Miss Klay.

286
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:31,683
I want to believe you.

287
00:27:35,687 --> 00:27:39,724
We may only be characters

288
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:42,293
or maybe

289
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:45,430
there really is a God who runs this story.

290
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:49,134
But…

291
00:27:50,301 --> 00:27:54,539
how can all of this be
a figment of my imagination

292
00:27:56,808 --> 00:27:59,077
if what I feel for you is real?

293
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:05,216
You were all real to me too.

294
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:10,155
Especially my feelings for all of you.

295
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:25,270
I told you this before…

296
00:28:27,272 --> 00:28:29,040
and I will say it again.

297
00:28:35,413 --> 00:28:38,516
I love you so much.

298
00:29:21,126 --> 00:29:23,128
All my life,

299
00:29:26,464 --> 00:29:30,335
you're the only one who has showed me…

300
00:29:32,804 --> 00:29:35,440
how it is to be truly loved…

301
00:29:37,375 --> 00:29:39,644
by a man.

302
00:29:43,882 --> 00:29:47,485
Thank you so much
for appreciating me, Fidel.

303
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:56,661
But I need to go now.

304
00:30:06,171 --> 00:30:07,505
Klay.

305
00:30:09,274 --> 00:30:10,942
Will I ever see you again?

306
00:30:57,856 --> 00:30:59,390
Good lord!

307
00:31:00,491 --> 00:31:01,893
What is that?

308
00:31:04,896 --> 00:31:06,464
That's the portal.

309
00:31:07,832 --> 00:31:10,735
That's my way back to my world.

310
00:31:17,008 --> 00:31:19,744
You are truly extraordinary, miss.

311
00:31:34,626 --> 00:31:36,461
Maybe in a different time.

312
00:31:38,263 --> 00:31:39,497
World?

313
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:47,105
When both our worlds are healed,

314
00:31:50,475 --> 00:31:51,709
maybe…

315
00:31:53,378 --> 00:31:55,813
maybe we're the endgame.

316
00:32:04,856 --> 00:32:10,395
No matter how hard
I keep track and research,

317
00:32:11,129 --> 00:32:16,301
I still cannot comprehend
some of the words you say.

318
00:32:27,011 --> 00:32:28,646
Ta-ta, Fidel.

319
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:22,813
Father.

320
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:23,748
Renato?

321
00:36:23,814 --> 00:36:27,018
A letter from the convent of Santa Clara.

322
00:36:37,061 --> 00:36:40,898
Your face seems to have brightened up
upon reading that letter.

323
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:50,141
An invitation for a ministerial position.

324
00:36:52,176 --> 00:36:54,345
In a convent, your reverence?

325
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:21,525
Goodbye, Fidel.

326
00:39:31,802 --> 00:39:34,171
Goodbye, <i>Noli Me Tangere</i>.

327
00:39:47,585 --> 00:39:48,586
Klay?

328
00:39:52,356 --> 00:39:53,858
Klay?

329
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:07,405
Klay.

330
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:42,006
Klay.

331
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:46,911
Klay.

332
00:41:07,531 --> 00:41:09,200
What took you so long?

333
00:41:09,266 --> 00:41:10,534
Where were you?

334
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:14,738
I went to the police station.

335
00:41:15,573 --> 00:41:17,842
Police station? Why?

336
00:41:21,212 --> 00:41:25,249
I asked around about Klay.
She's been gone the whole day.

337
00:41:28,586 --> 00:41:30,788
I'm worried, Ronald.

338
00:41:33,691 --> 00:41:37,661
Why? It hasn't been 24 hours.

339
00:41:38,229 --> 00:41:40,931
Who knows?
She might just be wandering around.

340
00:41:41,665 --> 00:41:45,936
But it's not like her to just leave!
What if something happens to her?

341
00:41:46,003 --> 00:41:48,973
I don't know. Maybe she ran away!

342
00:41:49,607 --> 00:41:51,208
Ran away?

343
00:41:52,443 --> 00:41:55,613
Narsing, don't look for her anymore.

344
00:41:55,679 --> 00:42:00,451
We'll have more room in this house!

345
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:02,553
This house is always messy, too small.

346
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:04,655
We never run out of problems!

347
00:42:17,167 --> 00:42:19,336
Did you and Dad just fight?

348
00:42:21,105 --> 00:42:22,206
No.

349
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:24,475
Don't think about it.

350
00:42:54,338 --> 00:42:56,240
I think someone's outside.

351
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:58,142
Stay here.

352
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:20,664
Mom!

353
00:43:21,398 --> 00:43:22,566
Is that Klay?

354
00:43:24,702 --> 00:43:25,736
Klay?

355
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:37,748
Hey!

356
00:43:37,815 --> 00:43:39,850
Maria Clara Infantes!

357
00:43:57,034 --> 00:43:58,235
Mom?

358
00:44:02,272 --> 00:44:03,874
It's really you!

359
00:44:12,449 --> 00:44:15,786
You look like
you haven't seen Mom in a long time.

360
00:44:18,522 --> 00:44:19,990
Elias!

361
00:44:20,891 --> 00:44:22,926
-My baby brother!
-Hey!

362
00:44:32,169 --> 00:44:33,370
Wait a minute.

363
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:39,276
Where have you been?

364
00:44:40,344 --> 00:44:41,779
Why didn't you ask for permission?

365
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:45,049
And why are you dressed like that?

366
00:44:45,115 --> 00:44:46,984
Did you attend a costume party?

367
00:44:48,052 --> 00:44:50,688
Were you cosplaying that's why you left?

368
00:44:53,123 --> 00:44:55,459
Answer my question.

369
00:44:55,959 --> 00:44:58,696
Where have you been?

370
00:44:59,229 --> 00:45:02,232
You did not text or call.
We were so worried.

371
00:45:02,299 --> 00:45:04,468
Even Stacy did not know where you were.

372
00:45:06,704 --> 00:45:08,138
Oh, Stacy.

373
00:45:11,108 --> 00:45:13,744
I haven't seen you in months.

374
00:45:14,878 --> 00:45:16,146
Months?

375
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:20,117
Maria Clara, stop overacting.

376
00:45:20,184 --> 00:45:21,852
It's only been a night.

377
00:45:24,455 --> 00:45:25,522
A night?

378
00:45:28,592 --> 00:45:30,327
I've only been gone for a night?

379
00:45:32,663 --> 00:45:34,231
Impossible.

380
00:45:36,567 --> 00:45:40,571
Are you still dreaming? Are you drunk?

381
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:46,076
What did you drink?
Tell me what's going on!

382
00:45:58,589 --> 00:45:59,857
Maria Clara.

383
00:46:00,591 --> 00:46:01,925
Answer me.

384
00:46:02,559 --> 00:46:05,129
What happened?

385
00:46:05,195 --> 00:46:08,799
Why are you dressed like that?
Where have you been?

386
00:46:11,969 --> 00:46:14,571
I thought I'd be stuck there for good.

387
00:46:15,339 --> 00:46:17,875
I thought I was trapped.

388
00:46:18,709 --> 00:46:21,712
What? Trapped? Where?

389
00:46:23,514 --> 00:46:25,282
Were you kidnapped?

390
00:46:30,721 --> 00:46:32,422
Oh, Mom.

391
00:46:33,257 --> 00:46:36,059
So many things happened to me.

392
00:46:36,126 --> 00:46:37,961
So many!

393
00:46:38,695 --> 00:46:43,433
I feel like I died and lived again.

394
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:51,809
"Rebirth?" What's with this nonsense?

395
00:46:51,875 --> 00:46:53,944
Don't start with me, Klay.

396
00:46:55,145 --> 00:46:57,481
It's like she's being possessed.

397
00:47:06,723 --> 00:47:08,559
I met a lot of people.

398
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:12,129
I've witnessed so much.

399
00:47:17,601 --> 00:47:19,570
And experienced so many things.

400
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:27,211
I was awakened by what I saw.

401
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:37,888
Then…

402
00:47:44,361 --> 00:47:46,630
Yeah, I was working.

403
00:47:46,697 --> 00:47:49,099
At the cosplay event.

404
00:47:49,166 --> 00:47:53,403
Yeah, it's extra income so I took the job.

405
00:47:53,470 --> 00:47:56,273
This is what the characters
look like there.

406
00:47:58,375 --> 00:48:02,079
My goodness, Klay! We were so worried!

407
00:48:09,753 --> 00:48:12,422
I'm sorry I left without saying anything.

408
00:48:18,128 --> 00:48:19,897
But I am here now.

409
00:48:22,232 --> 00:48:25,002
Why didn't you contact me the whole night?

410
00:48:25,869 --> 00:48:28,138
Now, you're here looking like that!

411
00:48:28,205 --> 00:48:29,573
What happened to you?

412
00:48:38,115 --> 00:48:39,182
Apologies.

413
00:48:43,453 --> 00:48:44,888
Be careful, miss.

414
00:48:47,791 --> 00:48:49,159
My apologies

415
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:57,868
Don't worry.

416
00:48:57,935 --> 00:49:03,240
I guess I over-internalized
the character I cosplayed.

417
00:49:21,758 --> 00:49:25,729
Did you run away because you were upset?

418
00:49:27,798 --> 00:49:29,399
Because we argued?

419
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:32,035
We argued?

420
00:49:35,272 --> 00:49:37,207
Don't you remember?

421
00:49:38,508 --> 00:49:40,344
We argued last night.

422
00:49:41,778 --> 00:49:46,083
I can't just take Elias away
from his father.

423
00:49:46,149 --> 00:49:49,052
You grew up without a dad.

424
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:51,088
Do you want your brother
to experience that too?

425
00:49:51,154 --> 00:49:53,690
He was never a father to me.

426
00:49:53,757 --> 00:49:56,693
Even so, is it okay for you
to be treated as his punching bag?

427
00:49:56,760 --> 00:50:00,364
You don't hurt the people you love.

428
00:50:00,430 --> 00:50:02,199
And you don't leave them behind.

429
00:50:02,265 --> 00:50:03,967
Just like what your dad did.

430
00:50:04,034 --> 00:50:06,169
I don't want to hear that again from you.

431
00:50:09,573 --> 00:50:11,274
Are you still mad at me?

432
00:50:18,015 --> 00:50:19,082
No, Mom.

433
00:50:20,617 --> 00:50:23,086
I wasn't upset at all.

434
00:50:24,488 --> 00:50:26,923
Are you sure? You're not sulking?

435
00:50:30,927 --> 00:50:32,529
Forget about it.

436
00:50:33,797 --> 00:50:34,831
Thank you.

437
00:50:35,499 --> 00:50:37,267
Thank you for understanding.

438
00:51:06,129 --> 00:51:07,164
<i>"Father Salvi…</i>

439
00:51:08,165 --> 00:51:11,101
<i>…will give a sermon
at the church of Santa Clara."</i>

440
00:51:11,168 --> 00:51:15,138
<i>I would like to visit Maria before I rest.</i>

441
00:51:16,106 --> 00:51:17,774
Do we have food? I'm hungry.

442
00:51:17,841 --> 00:51:20,677
No more but I can cook for you.

443
00:51:20,744 --> 00:51:24,014
I don't know how long
I have to convince myself

444
00:51:24,081 --> 00:51:25,882
that I am not wasting my time on you.

445
00:51:25,949 --> 00:51:27,717
<i>Besides, that epilogue isn't true.</i>

446
00:51:27,784 --> 00:51:29,453
<i>That's just a rumor by the gossipmongers.</i>

447
00:51:29,519 --> 00:51:30,821
<i>It's not verified.</i>

448
00:51:30,887 --> 00:51:32,355
<i>Many things can happen.</i>

449
00:51:32,422 --> 00:51:33,423
Fidel is not there.

450
00:51:33,490 --> 00:51:34,758
And Maria Clara--

451
00:51:34,825 --> 00:51:36,026
<i>It can't end like this.</i>

452
00:51:36,093 --> 00:51:38,628
<i>And Sir Ibarra. Where is he?</i>

453
00:51:39,763 --> 00:51:41,298
In <i>El Fili</i>.

454
00:51:41,364 --> 00:51:42,866
COMING UP…
