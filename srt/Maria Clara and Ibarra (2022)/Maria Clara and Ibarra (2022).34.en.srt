1
00:00:28,395 --> 00:00:30,663
MARIA CLARA AND IBARRA

2
00:00:31,231 --> 00:00:35,568
THIS PROGRAM, WHICH IS ADAPTED
FROM THE NOVELS OF DR. JOSE P. RIZAL,

3
00:00:35,635 --> 00:00:40,573
IS PRESENTED USING DRAMATIC ELEMENTS
TO CONNECT THE PRESENT AND THE PAST

4
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:45,912
IN A SPECIAL REIMAGINING OF THE NATIONAL
LITERATURE FILIPINOS ARE PROUD OF.

5
00:00:46,446 --> 00:00:49,616
<i>If you want to make it harder</i>
<i>for me to woo you, then so be it!</i>

6
00:00:49,682 --> 00:00:54,387
Or if you want me to chop wood for you
or fetch water from the stream or well,

7
00:00:54,454 --> 00:00:57,057
<i>I'd take that too.</i>
<i>Just don't make a fool out of me!</i>

8
00:00:57,123 --> 00:00:58,558
<i>He looks handsome when he's angry.</i>

9
00:00:58,625 --> 00:01:02,228
Maria Clara Infantes, don't give in.
Don't fall for him.

10
00:01:02,295 --> 00:01:07,400
<i>Señor, I need your help.
Can you please come with me</i>

11
00:01:07,467 --> 00:01:10,170
<i>and save Ms. Sisa from Señora Consolacion?</i>

12
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:11,871
I don't give a damn about that Sisa.

13
00:01:11,938 --> 00:01:12,906
<i>Me!</i>

14
00:01:12,972 --> 00:01:15,542
We will help her. Take us to her now.

15
00:01:15,608 --> 00:01:19,012
<i>-Leave the madwoman and go away!</i>
<i>-Who's the madwoman here?</i>

16
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:21,681
You, who's toying with someone
who's mentally ill?

17
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:23,450
My husband will hear about this!

18
00:01:23,516 --> 00:01:25,351
<i>He'll have you arrested
by the civil guards!</i>

19
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:27,854
Stop pretending to be
someone powerful, Missus.

20
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:31,357
<i>Everyone in San Diego knows
that the alferez is ashamed of you.</i>

21
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:34,694
<i>Father Salvi asked me to give him
something important.</i>

22
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:38,598
Your letters, in exchange for my mother's.

23
00:01:38,665 --> 00:01:40,867
And I gave them to him, Crisostomo.

24
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:43,870
<i>He threatened me,
that's why I was forced to do it.</i>

25
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:49,042
<i>If I don't give him</i>
<i>your letters, my father and godfather</i>

26
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:51,544
will be ruined and shamed
in front of everyone.

27
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:53,379
What's with your mother's letter

28
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:56,216
that could ruin the reputation
of your father and the curate?

29
00:01:56,282 --> 00:02:01,921
<i>We just wasted our time</i>
<i>reading Crisostomo Ibarra's letters!</i>

30
00:02:01,988 --> 00:02:05,892
Father, Señor Ibarra's penmanship
looks almost the same as yours.

31
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:10,130
It looks like your path
to heaven is all set, Renato.

32
00:02:10,196 --> 00:02:13,867
<i>I can already see my triumph, Maria.</i>

33
00:02:13,933 --> 00:02:19,572
<i>Now, I can fabricate evidence</i>
<i>of an anti-government ideology</i>

34
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:24,744
and frame your Crisostomo Ibarra
as the mastermind and involved

35
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:28,148
in the upcoming attack of the rebels.

36
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:31,251
<i>Once you've read it,
then you decide</i>

37
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:33,820
<i>if I'm still worthy of you.</i>

38
00:02:33,887 --> 00:02:38,892
Let's see if you and your beloved's
wedding will push through,

39
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:43,696
if he'll be rotting in prison.

40
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:47,333
PREVIOUSLY

41
00:02:52,705 --> 00:02:56,876
You probably can't believe
what you just learned.

42
00:03:05,251 --> 00:03:08,721
That the woman you've devoted
all your love to…

43
00:03:17,096 --> 00:03:19,666
is a fruit of immorality,

44
00:03:22,502 --> 00:03:24,804
and she's not worthy of marriage.

45
00:03:34,814 --> 00:03:35,915
Maria…

46
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:38,785
What I've just learned,

47
00:03:40,153 --> 00:03:42,388
won't change my feelings for you.

48
00:03:48,027 --> 00:03:50,196
But my real father…

49
00:03:55,635 --> 00:04:00,440
I despise Father Damaso for violating
and taking advantage of your mother.

50
00:04:05,612 --> 00:04:08,214
He stole my mother's dignity.

51
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:15,955
He also made you and your father suffer.

52
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:27,667
But I'll understand…

53
00:04:30,503 --> 00:04:32,405
if you stay away from me.

54
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:48,321
But promise me, promise me, Crisostomo,

55
00:04:49,756 --> 00:04:52,158
that you'll keep everything you now know

56
00:04:53,326 --> 00:04:56,195
a secret from our families

57
00:04:57,764 --> 00:04:59,666
and from everyone else.

58
00:05:00,266 --> 00:05:03,803
Promise me, my love. Promise me.

59
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:07,440
That is all I ask of you.

60
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:22,722
I don't want my father
to suffer from this truth.

61
00:05:24,357 --> 00:05:25,591
Promise me, Crisostomo…

62
00:05:27,126 --> 00:05:28,227
Please.

63
00:05:34,634 --> 00:05:35,902
This I promise you…

64
00:05:38,204 --> 00:05:40,006
I won't let this truth

65
00:05:40,073 --> 00:05:45,645
shatter your heart's happiness
today or tomorrow.

66
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:52,318
I will still fulfill
our promise to each other.

67
00:06:03,663 --> 00:06:06,299
Just like when you gave this to me…

68
00:06:10,136 --> 00:06:11,337
and promised me,

69
00:06:13,306 --> 00:06:15,041
that no matter what happens,

70
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:19,912
our wedding will push through as planned.

71
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:25,651
Would that be all right,

72
00:06:26,586 --> 00:06:28,354
my most beloved?

73
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:07,560
Bring those to the dining room, please.

74
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:15,301
Uncle.

75
00:07:16,369 --> 00:07:17,370
Auntie Isabel.

76
00:07:18,871 --> 00:07:24,043
Please forgive me if I came here alone.

77
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:28,881
But I mean every word I said before.

78
00:07:29,515 --> 00:07:31,551
I wish to marry Maria…

79
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,688
as soon as possible.

80
00:07:38,424 --> 00:07:42,028
If that would make
my beloved daughter happy,

81
00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:45,364
then who am I to oppose it?

82
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:49,335
Welcome to the family!

83
00:07:54,173 --> 00:07:55,942
Thank you, Uncle.

84
00:07:58,010 --> 00:07:59,045
Auntie Isabel.

85
00:07:59,846 --> 00:08:04,684
May this be the start
of our happy union as a family.

86
00:08:51,764 --> 00:08:54,634
<i>Fidel just left to get the carriage.</i>

87
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:59,238
As soon as we reach his house,
I'll treat your wounds, okay, Ms. Sisa?

88
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:08,381
Ms. Sisa?

89
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:13,986
Ms. Sisa, do you still remember me?

90
00:09:18,991 --> 00:09:20,826
Ms. Sisa, look at me.

91
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:25,765
Look into my eyes.

92
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:35,808
It's me…

93
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:38,744
Klay.

94
00:09:41,681 --> 00:09:44,350
Your sons treated me
like their older sister.

95
00:09:45,351 --> 00:09:47,320
<i>They are good to us, Mother.</i>

96
00:09:47,386 --> 00:09:52,258
Ms. Klay said that Señor Ibarra
would send us to school.

97
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:56,395
I was the one you chased with a knife,
the first time we met.

98
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,532
Ms. Sisa, Ms. Sisa!

99
00:10:00,499 --> 00:10:02,301
-Mother!
-You're an evil woman!

100
00:10:02,368 --> 00:10:03,502
Stay away from my sons!

101
00:10:03,569 --> 00:10:06,772
Don't chase me! It's so steep here!
Wait, I'm leaving! Okay, okay!

102
00:10:07,306 --> 00:10:11,143
And we were together back then
looking for them.

103
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:18,985
Take courage. Don't lose hope, okay?

104
00:10:25,257 --> 00:10:26,592
I'm Klay.

105
00:10:35,001 --> 00:10:35,968
Klay…

106
00:10:39,605 --> 00:10:40,706
Yes.

107
00:10:41,207 --> 00:10:42,074
Yes!

108
00:10:45,177 --> 00:10:46,479
Klay…

109
00:11:03,462 --> 00:11:04,697
I'm certain…

110
00:11:06,098 --> 00:11:08,034
that she's longing for you too.

111
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:11,570
Being separated from her child

112
00:11:11,637 --> 00:11:13,739
is the worst pain a mother
can ever experience.

113
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:20,012
But I believe that
you will be reunited again.

114
00:11:21,147 --> 00:11:22,815
I missed you, Ms. Sisa.

115
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:06,125
Klay.

116
00:12:08,994 --> 00:12:11,297
How is Ms. Sisa doing?

117
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:15,735
She's fine now.

118
00:12:19,772 --> 00:12:22,575
Thank you for defending her earlier.

119
00:12:23,943 --> 00:12:27,847
If you're not there,
I wouldn't be able to go against

120
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:30,583
that mean and arrogant social climber.

121
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:36,388
It's like you're admitting that…

122
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:39,225
you can be weak sometimes.

123
00:12:43,562 --> 00:12:44,930
I just don't like trouble.

124
00:12:48,234 --> 00:12:52,605
But you know that I can punch
that social climber anytime.

125
00:12:53,973 --> 00:12:56,041
But if I do that, then what will happen?

126
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:59,512
I will go to prison, then your friend
will be dragged into my trouble.

127
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:04,049
That's why I'm grateful
that you were there.

128
00:13:13,592 --> 00:13:14,493
Klay, it's…

129
00:13:15,528 --> 00:13:16,829
it's almost nine.

130
00:13:16,896 --> 00:13:17,930
So…

131
00:13:19,265 --> 00:13:21,000
Let's just spend the night here.

132
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,575
It's a miracle.

133
00:13:30,342 --> 00:13:31,911
There are no objections from you.

134
00:13:33,212 --> 00:13:34,647
What else can I do?

135
00:13:35,581 --> 00:13:36,849
You said it yourself. It's late.

136
00:13:39,552 --> 00:13:40,519
Well then…

137
00:13:42,688 --> 00:13:44,790
I'll just prepare your room for tonight.

138
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:47,326
Just go there later.

139
00:14:06,245 --> 00:14:07,446
Don't fall for him.

140
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:10,883
You'll be sleeping here
only because it's already late.

141
00:14:29,068 --> 00:14:30,569
Good evening, curate.

142
00:14:34,807 --> 00:14:39,245
How many people have you
bribed to join your group?

143
00:14:40,246 --> 00:14:41,347
Ten people already.

144
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:44,116
Very good…

145
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:46,285
very good.

146
00:14:47,086 --> 00:14:51,123
Well then, prepare yourselves

147
00:14:52,658 --> 00:14:54,360
by tomorrow night.

148
00:14:55,461 --> 00:14:59,698
<i>When the clock strikes ten,</i>
<i>you will attack the barracks.</i>

149
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,268
<i>You don't have to worry</i>

150
00:15:02,334 --> 00:15:06,305
<i>because there's only one</i>
<i>civil guard left there.</i>

151
00:15:06,972 --> 00:15:09,074
<i>The others are patrolling
around San Diego,</i>

152
00:15:09,141 --> 00:15:11,911
<i>so you can easily overpower him.</i>

153
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:17,750
<i>You will then burn down the barracks
while shouting the name of your leader</i>

154
00:15:17,816 --> 00:15:20,786
<i>for all the people of San Diego to hear.</i>

155
00:15:24,456 --> 00:15:27,359
Long live the revolution against Spain!

156
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:29,828
-Long live!
-Long live our supremo,

157
00:15:29,895 --> 00:15:32,631
-Crisostomo Ibarra!
-Long live!

158
00:15:35,234 --> 00:15:37,636
Can I count on you, Lucas?

159
00:15:38,804 --> 00:15:41,273
Yes, curate. I won't let you down.

160
00:15:43,008 --> 00:15:45,110
All right, you may go now.

161
00:15:58,357 --> 00:16:01,293
You will all see tomorrow night.

162
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:08,233
Crisostomo Ibarra will be
considered a delinquent.

163
00:16:11,337 --> 00:16:15,074
Let's see if his wedding to Maria Clara
will still push through.

164
00:17:02,488 --> 00:17:03,489
Klay…

165
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:05,424
Why…

166
00:17:06,058 --> 00:17:07,059
are you still up?

167
00:17:08,394 --> 00:17:09,795
Can't sleep?

168
00:17:12,564 --> 00:17:13,665
I jerked out of sleep.

169
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:18,937
I had a bad dream about Sir Ibarra.

170
00:17:22,274 --> 00:17:24,143
I dreamt that he fell off a cliff.

171
00:17:25,811 --> 00:17:27,746
I was there too,
but I couldn't do anything.

172
00:17:29,515 --> 00:17:30,949
I wasn't able to save him.

173
00:17:35,154 --> 00:17:37,956
Don't worry, Ms. Klay.

174
00:17:39,591 --> 00:17:41,160
That was just a dream.

175
00:17:46,298 --> 00:17:47,332
Then again…

176
00:17:48,634 --> 00:17:53,705
my friend is more important
to you than I am.

177
00:17:57,543 --> 00:17:58,677
Jealous?

178
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:06,785
I hope morning comes soon,

179
00:18:07,286 --> 00:18:10,489
so Ms. Sisa and I can go home,
and I can check on Sir Ibarra.

180
00:18:38,817 --> 00:18:39,885
I'm so pretty.

181
00:18:45,057 --> 00:18:48,894
Why are we going to mass so early?

182
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:50,462
We didn't even have breakfast!

183
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:53,198
Stop complaining, Tiburcio!
Stop complaining!

184
00:19:00,372 --> 00:19:01,807
Oh, my God.

185
00:19:01,874 --> 00:19:04,009
Please hear our prayer.

186
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:06,678
Please accept our fasting,

187
00:19:07,179 --> 00:19:09,915
especially for Alfonso.

188
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:11,116
Amen.

189
00:19:11,884 --> 00:19:13,018
Amen.

190
00:19:35,474 --> 00:19:39,678
Let's just stay here to avoid people
who might ridicule Ms. Sisa.

191
00:19:49,254 --> 00:19:55,661
What is this mystery
unfolding in our town?

192
00:19:57,763 --> 00:19:59,665
What do you call those birds?

193
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:02,067
Those are vultures.

194
00:20:04,002 --> 00:20:07,506
Vultures rarely come here.

195
00:20:09,441 --> 00:20:12,578
The presence of vultures

196
00:20:12,644 --> 00:20:17,749
only means that there's
a dead animal nearby,

197
00:20:17,816 --> 00:20:21,920
and they are just waiting for their chance

198
00:20:21,987 --> 00:20:25,357
to feast on its corpse.

199
00:20:27,626 --> 00:20:31,897
I'm worried for our town,
that's why I called you here.

200
00:20:32,965 --> 00:20:36,268
No matter how much I pray,
I can't seem to eradicate

201
00:20:37,169 --> 00:20:40,539
the devil who wants to poison our town.

202
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:45,077
I don't understand you.

203
00:20:46,712 --> 00:20:48,413
Listen carefully, señor.

204
00:20:50,449 --> 00:20:52,718
I heard the news
that there will be an attack

205
00:20:52,784 --> 00:20:56,088
on this town tonight at 10 o'clock.

206
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:00,092
What?

207
00:21:00,158 --> 00:21:04,563
Because there's a woman
who confessed to me

208
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:07,699
and her conscience couldn't bear

209
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:11,970
the looming destruction of San Diego

210
00:21:12,037 --> 00:21:16,575
at the hands of the revolutionists.

211
00:21:17,909 --> 00:21:21,647
She entrusted a letter to me,

212
00:21:23,081 --> 00:21:25,684
that was from Señor Crisostomo Ibarra.

213
00:21:27,886 --> 00:21:29,054
From Señor Ibarra?

214
00:21:29,688 --> 00:21:30,989
Yes.

215
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:37,095
Because Señor Crisostomo Ibarra

216
00:21:37,162 --> 00:21:40,832
is the mastermind of the revolution
that will happen tonight.

217
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:57,215
Oh, Saint Bartholomew! Omen of death!

218
00:21:57,282 --> 00:21:59,251
Omen of death!

219
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:03,588
-My wife is very superstitious!
-Flowers!

220
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:06,658
-Flowers for the dead!
-Victorina!

221
00:22:07,225 --> 00:22:08,393
Victorina!

222
00:22:10,429 --> 00:22:12,097
Aren't you used to it?

223
00:22:12,864 --> 00:22:15,867
There are a lot of vultures in our town.

224
00:22:27,112 --> 00:22:29,281
Let's follow the vultures.

225
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:36,755
Grandfather Tasyo?

226
00:22:38,657 --> 00:22:39,491
Grandfather Tasyo!

227
00:22:46,565 --> 00:22:47,733
Ms. Klay,

228
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:49,701
let's go.

229
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:53,739
I'm sure that your Ibarra
is already worried.

230
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:32,377
"A…

231
00:23:33,812 --> 00:23:35,280
revolution…

232
00:23:37,449 --> 00:23:39,418
is needed…

233
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,188
to free…

234
00:23:47,692 --> 00:23:49,327
our country…

235
00:23:53,698 --> 00:23:55,300
from the…

236
00:23:56,401 --> 00:24:00,238
Spanish conquerors."

237
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:08,246
"And this will happen tomorrow, Tuesday,
at exactly ten o'clock at night."

238
00:24:09,581 --> 00:24:13,518
"May we succeed in our aspiration

239
00:24:13,585 --> 00:24:17,289
to drive away foreign conquerors,

240
00:24:18,657 --> 00:24:21,927
and finally achieve
the great freedom of our country.

241
00:24:22,828 --> 00:24:25,697
With love and courage…

242
00:24:27,432 --> 00:24:30,068
-Crisostomo Ibarra."
-Crisostomo Ibarra.

243
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:37,542
See, Señor alferez? Ibarra is a traitor.

244
00:24:37,609 --> 00:24:40,345
So, what are you waiting for?

245
00:24:40,412 --> 00:24:44,950
Get your civil guards to arrest
and imprison him.

246
00:25:07,606 --> 00:25:09,541
What is the vulture feasting on?

247
00:25:17,048 --> 00:25:18,583
Get away!

248
00:25:22,787 --> 00:25:24,523
Merciful God!

249
00:25:25,724 --> 00:25:27,259
This is a corpse of a child.

250
00:25:29,995 --> 00:25:31,329
Run, Tala…

251
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:33,932
Go to the house of the Ibarras.

252
00:25:35,166 --> 00:25:39,971
Tell them that Crispin, Sisa's son,
has finally been found!

253
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:51,216
They killed a child!

254
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:55,453
Who will they kill next?

255
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:10,502
Strange birds.

256
00:26:22,314 --> 00:26:23,181
Sir?

257
00:26:26,451 --> 00:26:28,386
And why are you looking at me like that?

258
00:26:29,688 --> 00:26:32,457
It seems that the miss
is worried about you, my friend.

259
00:26:33,692 --> 00:26:36,194
And why are you worried
about me, Ms. Klay?

260
00:26:37,195 --> 00:26:38,163
Because…

261
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:40,365
What happened?

262
00:26:41,833 --> 00:26:42,934
Ms. Sisa?

263
00:26:44,536 --> 00:26:47,372
She escaped from the hospice, my friend.

264
00:26:48,707 --> 00:26:50,241
Ms. Sisa…

265
00:26:50,308 --> 00:26:51,576
Why did you do that?

266
00:26:54,012 --> 00:26:54,913
Klay…

267
00:26:57,215 --> 00:26:58,216
Klay…

268
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:08,493
I can feel my son's presence.

269
00:27:10,328 --> 00:27:11,997
Crispin is here.

270
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:15,500
I can feel my youngest son.

271
00:27:17,068 --> 00:27:19,137
Crispin is here.

272
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:20,805
-Ms. Sisa!
-Ms. Sisa…

273
00:27:20,872 --> 00:27:22,841
-Ms. Sisa.
-My son…

274
00:27:22,907 --> 00:27:23,842
Ms. Sisa.

275
00:27:23,908 --> 00:27:25,076
My son.

276
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:30,382
I can't believe
Señor Ibarra could do this.

277
00:27:30,882 --> 00:27:34,619
We already have evidence,
yet you still don't believe it?

278
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:39,724
How can I be sure
that it was indeed Señor Ibarra

279
00:27:40,291 --> 00:27:42,427
who wrote the letter?

280
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:45,563
Me too! I was surprised.

281
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:48,099
I also had my doubts at first.

282
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:53,338
Good thing I also have another letter
that came from Maria Clara.

283
00:27:54,539 --> 00:27:59,210
This was Ibarra's letter to his fiancée.

284
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:02,781
Compare the two.

285
00:28:06,151 --> 00:28:09,421
The penmanship on both letters
is the same, right?

286
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:17,562
That's why I'm sure that
it was indeed Crisostomo Ibarra

287
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:20,265
who wrote the letter.

288
00:28:26,638 --> 00:28:28,940
It seems that both penmanships
are the same.

289
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:36,881
But I want to ensure
that the revolution will happen.

290
00:28:39,317 --> 00:28:43,321
Father, do you know where
they will attack first?

291
00:28:44,355 --> 00:28:45,724
At your barracks.

292
00:28:47,125 --> 00:28:51,629
To steal your weapons
and burn down your stations.

293
00:28:54,432 --> 00:28:56,568
That was the confession

294
00:28:56,634 --> 00:28:59,704
of the sister of one
of the revolutionists.

295
00:29:01,606 --> 00:29:02,974
My headquarters?

296
00:29:03,041 --> 00:29:05,110
-Yes.
-My headquarters?

297
00:29:05,176 --> 00:29:06,311
This cannot be!

298
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:08,480
They will fail!

299
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:11,816
They will see! They will fail!

300
00:29:34,372 --> 00:29:35,740
Why, dear?

301
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:39,277
I don't know, Auntie, but…

302
00:29:40,311 --> 00:29:42,080
I suddenly felt nervous.

303
00:29:44,382 --> 00:29:46,151
My heart is pounding so hard.

304
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:56,427
Oh, it is!

305
00:29:57,362 --> 00:29:59,197
What could be happening to you?

306
00:30:06,037 --> 00:30:08,072
Maria, your godfather…

307
00:30:12,076 --> 00:30:13,244
Is he here?

308
00:30:14,546 --> 00:30:17,048
Please tell him that I'm asleep.

309
00:30:17,615 --> 00:30:19,584
I'm still not yet ready to face him.

310
00:30:20,585 --> 00:30:23,154
Oh, no. He just sent a letter.

311
00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:25,690
He didn't come here to say goodbye.

312
00:30:27,692 --> 00:30:29,294
He went back to Manila.

313
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:33,431
It seems like you don't want
to see your godfather.

314
00:30:35,934 --> 00:30:37,602
I just suddenly felt ill.

315
00:30:41,239 --> 00:30:42,974
I want to rest for a while,

316
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:46,644
and not entertain any visitors.

317
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:10,468
Crispin, my son?

318
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:12,570
Crispin?

319
00:31:14,973 --> 00:31:18,243
I know you're here.
Show yourself to your mother!

320
00:31:18,309 --> 00:31:20,578
Stop hiding from your mother!

321
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:24,249
-Crispin?
-Ms. Sisa…

322
00:31:24,983 --> 00:31:28,186
-Let's go, come with me.
-I can feel his presence.

323
00:31:28,253 --> 00:31:29,320
He is here.

324
00:31:31,823 --> 00:31:33,258
Crispin?

325
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:38,062
Dear.

326
00:31:48,539 --> 00:31:51,042
Show yourself to your mother.

327
00:31:51,109 --> 00:31:52,477
<i>Ms. Sisa?</i>

328
00:31:54,279 --> 00:31:55,280
Ms. Sisa!

329
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:01,219
Come with me.

330
00:32:01,719 --> 00:32:03,054
Your son!

331
00:32:04,389 --> 00:32:05,456
My son?

332
00:32:06,891 --> 00:32:08,493
Wait.

333
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:09,627
Wait!

334
00:32:26,377 --> 00:32:31,282
Good thing we thought of passing by here
to check on our animal trap.

335
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:34,585
I hope your suspicion is wrong.

336
00:32:35,086 --> 00:32:36,854
I hope that's not the young sacristan.

337
00:32:46,764 --> 00:32:49,367
What now, Lupo? Did you see the face?

338
00:32:49,434 --> 00:32:50,535
Whose body is it?

339
00:32:51,736 --> 00:32:54,505
-The face and body are already decaying.
-Oh, my goodness.

340
00:32:56,174 --> 00:32:57,375
Keep that away from us!

341
00:33:00,178 --> 00:33:01,713
This is indeed Crispin.

342
00:33:02,714 --> 00:33:05,483
The sacristan is already dead.

343
00:33:10,888 --> 00:33:11,990
Crispin, my son?

344
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:13,992
Crispin?

345
00:33:15,226 --> 00:33:16,427
Where's my son?

346
00:33:47,725 --> 00:33:48,893
Crispin?

347
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:54,032
Crispin, my son?

348
00:33:55,666 --> 00:33:56,534
Crispin?

349
00:33:58,136 --> 00:33:59,470
Crispin!

350
00:34:32,203 --> 00:34:33,871
Stop her, stop her!

351
00:34:33,938 --> 00:34:35,740
Keep her away, keep her away.

352
00:34:36,607 --> 00:34:39,477
-I want to embrace my son!
-That's enough!

353
00:34:39,544 --> 00:34:41,345
Let go of me!

354
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:42,447
Let me do it.

355
00:34:46,884 --> 00:34:49,253
Crispin, my dear…

356
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:17,181
My mother…

357
00:35:44,208 --> 00:35:48,412
My son!

358
00:35:55,853 --> 00:35:58,456
My son…

359
00:36:29,887 --> 00:36:32,890
Ms. Sisa? Ms. Sisa…

360
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:04,655
Ms. Sisa…

361
00:37:07,725 --> 00:37:09,860
<i>Just like most of our countrymen</i>

362
00:37:09,927 --> 00:37:13,097
<i>who accept things as their fate.</i>

363
00:37:13,798 --> 00:37:15,366
<i>I love this country,</i>

364
00:37:15,433 --> 00:37:17,635
<i>because my happiness is here.</i>

365
00:37:18,536 --> 00:37:19,604
<i>And I…</i>

366
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:24,208
I love my country because of
the misfortune I endured.

367
00:37:24,275 --> 00:37:25,309
<i>But remember this,</i>

368
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:29,113
as long as every family in our town
is in the hands of the Spaniards,

369
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:31,048
you will never be happy and peaceful.

370
00:37:31,115 --> 00:37:32,750
They will destroy and kill you,

371
00:37:32,817 --> 00:37:34,485
just like my ancestors.

372
00:37:34,552 --> 00:37:36,320
Just like my kin.

373
00:37:36,387 --> 00:37:37,488
Just like your father.

374
00:38:07,718 --> 00:38:09,654
My son…

375
00:38:11,522 --> 00:38:12,690
My son…

376
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:17,828
Look after Ms. Sisa.
Don't let her out of your sight, okay?

377
00:38:25,202 --> 00:38:28,005
Let's go home to our hut.

378
00:38:31,375 --> 00:38:32,977
Come, my son.

379
00:38:33,844 --> 00:38:37,114
Mother's been waiting for you
for a long time.

380
00:38:59,603 --> 00:39:04,909
Senior officer, I came here to do my duty.

381
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:08,079
Has my order been executed?

382
00:39:08,579 --> 00:39:09,847
Yes, señor.

383
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:11,582
Very good.

384
00:39:12,149 --> 00:39:15,386
Now we will see if Señor Ibarra's

385
00:39:16,454 --> 00:39:18,622
planned revolution will succeed.

386
00:39:43,781 --> 00:39:46,317
He stole my mother's dignity.

387
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:50,955
<i>I despise Father Damaso for violating</i>
<i>and taking advantage of your mother.</i>

388
00:39:51,822 --> 00:39:54,992
<i>He also made you and your father suffer.</i>

389
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:58,362
Those who pretend to be holy,
would they reach heaven?

390
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:01,866
Devil spawn!

391
00:40:03,734 --> 00:40:07,071
As long as every family in this town
is in the hands of the Spaniards,

392
00:40:07,671 --> 00:40:09,573
<i>you will never be happy and peaceful.</i>

393
00:40:20,584 --> 00:40:22,286
Sir! Sir, stop!

394
00:40:22,353 --> 00:40:23,521
Stop!

395
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:26,424
Sir, that's enough.

396
00:40:26,490 --> 00:40:28,325
Sir, enough. Enough.

397
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:30,761
Sir!

398
00:40:35,499 --> 00:40:36,901
Let it bleed…

399
00:40:38,602 --> 00:40:40,604
so I can feel the pain more.

400
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:45,309
Right.

401
00:40:47,812 --> 00:40:49,547
Your hunch was right…

402
00:40:52,483 --> 00:40:54,785
They killed Ms. Sisa's son.

403
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:57,288
Elias was right.

404
00:41:00,624 --> 00:41:04,862
They will oppress
and kill whoever they want.

405
00:41:08,666 --> 00:41:10,034
His family.

406
00:41:13,237 --> 00:41:14,271
My father.

407
00:41:17,107 --> 00:41:18,642
Crispin, and who else?

408
00:41:22,179 --> 00:41:24,215
Did they also kill Basilio?

409
00:41:31,222 --> 00:41:32,456
And Maria?

410
00:41:36,627 --> 00:41:38,562
And the things her family suffered from?

411
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:45,669
And every family in this town!

412
00:41:50,541 --> 00:41:52,443
I want to retaliate!

413
00:41:53,477 --> 00:41:55,946
And get vengeance for all their sins, but…

414
00:42:00,618 --> 00:42:01,986
I can't!

415
00:42:06,624 --> 00:42:09,960
I must endure. I must restrain myself.

416
00:42:10,561 --> 00:42:11,662
But until when?

417
00:42:13,130 --> 00:42:15,566
Until when can I bear all of these?

418
00:42:15,633 --> 00:42:17,134
Sir!

419
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:19,436
You must endure a bit longer!

420
00:42:29,213 --> 00:42:30,447
If I may ask, sir,

421
00:42:30,514 --> 00:42:34,885
isn't it part of your dream
for San Diego to eradicate

422
00:42:34,952 --> 00:42:38,756
the injustices and cruelty of
the friars and civil guards

423
00:42:38,822 --> 00:42:40,691
against our countrymen?

424
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:44,194
Coming from you?

425
00:42:47,598 --> 00:42:50,301
Didn't you reprimand Fidel and me recently

426
00:42:51,468 --> 00:42:54,305
for not taking action
and turning a blind eye

427
00:42:54,371 --> 00:42:56,173
to all the injustices happening?

428
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:04,848
Why does it seem like
your views in life have changed?

429
00:43:04,915 --> 00:43:06,984
Because I don't want to endanger you.

430
00:43:09,186 --> 00:43:10,621
I don't want you to die!

431
00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:15,159
I'm scared too, sir.

432
00:43:18,495 --> 00:43:21,198
I don't want you to die!

433
00:43:22,967 --> 00:43:26,170
So if we have to be
more patient, then be it!

434
00:43:26,236 --> 00:43:29,573
If we have to endure longer,
we will do it!

435
00:43:31,208 --> 00:43:33,110
We need to be careful.

436
00:44:27,364 --> 00:44:30,701
<i>The sacristan has been found,</i>
<i>but Crispin is already dead.</i>

437
00:44:30,768 --> 00:44:32,002
Mother of God!

438
00:44:32,069 --> 00:44:34,772
We saw the rotting corpse
of a child in the forest.

439
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:37,908
We need your help, Chief, my friend.

440
00:44:37,975 --> 00:44:40,244
Are we really friends, señor?

441
00:44:40,310 --> 00:44:41,445
What about Crispin's body?

442
00:44:41,512 --> 00:44:43,113
I'll ask the gravedigger

443
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:46,283
to accompany Ms. Sisa in burying Crispin.

444
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:47,618
Did you see Ms. Sisa?

445
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:48,986
Isn't she in the room?

446
00:44:49,053 --> 00:44:51,021
I checked, but she wasn't there.

447
00:44:51,088 --> 00:44:54,825
I already spoke to Mr. Ibarra.
Our leader has given the signal.

448
00:44:54,892 --> 00:44:56,727
<i>We will attack the barracks later.</i>

449
00:44:56,794 --> 00:44:58,228
<i>You need to leave right now</i>

450
00:44:58,295 --> 00:44:59,663
because any moment

451
00:44:59,730 --> 00:45:02,299
<i>the civil guards will come and arrest you!</i>

452
00:45:02,366 --> 00:45:03,434
For what reason?

453
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:06,403
For being the leader of
the upcoming revolution.

454
00:45:07,004 --> 00:45:09,139
COMING UP

455
00:45:09,206 --> 00:45:11,775
