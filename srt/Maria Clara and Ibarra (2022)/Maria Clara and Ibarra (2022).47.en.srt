1
00:00:30,764 --> 00:00:32,999
MARIA CLARA AND IBARRA

2
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:37,037
THIS PROGRAM, WHICH IS ADAPTED
FROM THE NOVELS OF DR. JOSE P. RIZAL,

3
00:00:37,103 --> 00:00:41,074
IS PRESENTED USING DRAMATIC ELEMENTS
TO CONNECT THE PRESENT AND THE PAST

4
00:00:41,141 --> 00:00:46,379
IN A SPECIAL REIMAGINING OF THE NATIONAL
LITERATURE FILIPINOS ARE PROUD OF.

5
00:00:46,446 --> 00:00:47,714
Go find Simoun.

6
00:00:47,781 --> 00:00:51,184
Father Salvi will find out
his true identity anytime soon.

7
00:00:51,251 --> 00:00:53,820
I'm sure that he has read the book by now.

8
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:55,722
You need to get me out of here.

9
00:00:55,789 --> 00:00:57,624
There's so much you need to know.

10
00:00:57,690 --> 00:00:58,958
Who are you?

11
00:00:59,025 --> 00:01:00,693
PREVIOUSLY

12
00:01:04,097 --> 00:01:06,633
Fidel? How I've missed you.

13
00:01:06,699 --> 00:01:09,002
I've waited for you for so long, Ms. Klay.

14
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:10,737
I am thankful that you came back.

15
00:01:10,804 --> 00:01:15,842
Would you like your mother's soul
to be disturbed again?

16
00:01:16,342 --> 00:01:18,912
Let's also include your brother Crispin.

17
00:01:18,978 --> 00:01:20,313
That's enough, Father!

18
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:22,916
Aren't you content
with what you did before?

19
00:01:22,982 --> 00:01:25,852
Based on how you cry and shiver,

20
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:28,755
what's written in the book is right.

21
00:01:28,822 --> 00:01:32,425
Simoun and the filibuster Ibarra

22
00:01:32,492 --> 00:01:34,027
are one and the same person.

23
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:35,962
The bandits attacked us

24
00:01:36,029 --> 00:01:38,231
and they took the woman with them.

25
00:01:38,298 --> 00:01:39,432
Fools!

26
00:01:39,499 --> 00:01:40,567
The sun is shining brightly

27
00:01:40,633 --> 00:01:42,669
and yet a female prisoner
escaped from you?

28
00:01:42,735 --> 00:01:45,638
Find and arrest that woman!

29
00:01:45,705 --> 00:01:48,007
Where is that mysterious book?

30
00:01:48,074 --> 00:01:49,242
Father, they took it.

31
00:01:49,309 --> 00:01:51,511
If I am not mistaken,
Klay and her group took it.

32
00:01:51,578 --> 00:01:53,513
You devil!

33
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:56,716
You and Crisostomo will not succeed

34
00:01:56,783 --> 00:02:00,420
because I will reveal his true identity.

35
00:02:00,487 --> 00:02:03,056
I thought I would never get this back.

36
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:04,657
Our leader is here.

37
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:07,460
Elias?

38
00:02:07,527 --> 00:02:08,628
You're alive?

39
00:02:08,695 --> 00:02:10,930
I finished reading the book.

40
00:02:10,997 --> 00:02:12,432
You should no longer be in <i>El Fili</i>.

41
00:02:12,499 --> 00:02:14,934
It means that I did change the story.

42
00:02:15,001 --> 00:02:18,004
We need to find Simoun soon.

43
00:02:18,071 --> 00:02:19,973
What do you need from that man?

44
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:22,976
He is a known opportunist
and a friend of the Spaniards

45
00:02:23,042 --> 00:02:23,910
who are oppressing us.

46
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:25,512
Are you ready?

47
00:02:29,082 --> 00:02:30,984
He's already dead, isn't he?

48
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:34,621
How can Crisostomo and Simoun
be the same person?

49
00:02:36,189 --> 00:02:37,790
Believe me.

50
00:02:38,725 --> 00:02:42,495
He may have changed the color
of his hair, his clothes.

51
00:02:42,562 --> 00:02:44,330
He may be wearing more accessories.

52
00:02:44,397 --> 00:02:45,465
But it's still him.

53
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:47,767
Ibarra is alive.

54
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:51,771
We need to talk to him
as soon as possible.

55
00:02:52,972 --> 00:02:54,307
Everything is written here.

56
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:56,543
That's what I'm afraid of.

57
00:02:56,609 --> 00:02:59,279
Father Salvi read some parts of the book.

58
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:01,681
Is that the novel

59
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:04,284
you told us about before,

60
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:07,554
where we are only characters from a story?

61
00:03:08,655 --> 00:03:12,992
Actually, this is the second
part of that first story.

62
00:03:13,059 --> 00:03:14,961
Sort of like book two.

63
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:21,301
I'm sorry.

64
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:23,937
I know it's hard to believe
everything I'm saying

65
00:03:24,003 --> 00:03:26,673
but I don't have much time
to explain everything to you.

66
00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:28,341
Can we just read the book later?

67
00:03:28,408 --> 00:03:30,176
Let's talk about this later. I beg of you.

68
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:31,578
Let's now look for Simoun.

69
00:03:35,682 --> 00:03:36,950
Klay,

70
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:42,622
ever since I saw you cross
that mysterious tunnel…

71
00:03:43,856 --> 00:03:45,258
Looking at you now,

72
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:47,927
it's as if nothing had changed.

73
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:49,162
Ms. Klay,

74
00:03:50,196 --> 00:03:52,332
nothing is impossible for me now.

75
00:03:53,466 --> 00:03:55,235
I believe in that book,

76
00:03:56,035 --> 00:03:57,237
and in you.

77
00:04:02,508 --> 00:04:04,077
I know where Simoun is.

78
00:04:05,144 --> 00:04:08,314
But his current location is dangerous.

79
00:04:10,016 --> 00:04:11,684
Dangerous for all of us.

80
00:04:12,785 --> 00:04:15,421
It's more dangerous
that Father Salvi knows he is alive.

81
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:18,391
Simoun might be arrested or killed.

82
00:04:19,659 --> 00:04:22,395
Do you want that to happen to your friend?

83
00:04:22,462 --> 00:04:23,930
To our friend?

84
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:28,801
-Hernando.
-Leader?

85
00:04:28,868 --> 00:04:30,270
Go back to our base.

86
00:04:30,336 --> 00:04:33,039
We might need some backup.

87
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:35,775
We will go ahead to
the Captain General's vacation house.

88
00:04:36,909 --> 00:04:37,910
Hurry.

89
00:04:44,217 --> 00:04:45,218
Let's go.

90
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:57,096
<i>Father, if you had
joined our hunt earlier,</i>

91
00:04:57,163 --> 00:04:59,565
<i>we could have already talked about that.</i>

92
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:00,800
It would have been complicated

93
00:05:00,867 --> 00:05:06,472
if I revealed it during
the hunt, Captain General.

94
00:05:06,539 --> 00:05:08,908
Instead of killing a wild boar,

95
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:11,544
you might have ended up shooting a person.

96
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:26,759
-Isagani.
-Basilio…

97
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:29,228
How do we get inside?

98
00:05:29,295 --> 00:05:31,664
It's surrounded by
those damned civil guards.

99
00:05:34,067 --> 00:05:35,435
What do we do now?

100
00:05:37,236 --> 00:05:40,440
I am getting nervous
about what Father Salvi will do

101
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:43,343
now that he already knows
the truth about Señor Simoun.

102
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:46,512
Isagani,

103
00:05:47,213 --> 00:05:49,716
we need to share this with Klay.

104
00:05:50,316 --> 00:05:51,584
But what can she do?

105
00:05:52,151 --> 00:05:53,186
She's behind bars.

106
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:59,058
Wait here.

107
00:06:08,901 --> 00:06:10,169
Basilio.

108
00:06:11,337 --> 00:06:12,405
Klay?

109
00:06:13,606 --> 00:06:15,208
How did you get out?

110
00:06:15,274 --> 00:06:16,642
Where is Sir Ibarra?

111
00:06:17,777 --> 00:06:19,245
I mean, Simoun.

112
00:06:19,312 --> 00:06:22,648
Klay, we don't know how to get near him.

113
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:25,218
The place is surrounded by civil guards,

114
00:06:25,284 --> 00:06:28,454
especially now that Father Salvi
has confirmed the truth

115
00:06:28,521 --> 00:06:32,859
that Señor Simoun and Señor Ibarra
are one and the same.

116
00:06:36,195 --> 00:06:38,030
It seems danger looms

117
00:06:38,097 --> 00:06:39,966
with the information
you're holding, Father.

118
00:06:40,533 --> 00:06:43,936
that you believe
it can lead to one's death.

119
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:47,440
Even then,

120
00:06:49,609 --> 00:06:52,578
he should have been sentenced to death.

121
00:06:52,645 --> 00:06:57,450
The truth is he made everyone believe
that he is dead.

122
00:06:57,517 --> 00:07:02,188
But he has been fooling
all of us for a long time.

123
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:03,656
Calm down, Father.

124
00:07:03,723 --> 00:07:05,358
What are you talking about?

125
00:07:09,128 --> 00:07:11,764
How can I calm down, Captain General,

126
00:07:13,132 --> 00:07:16,869
when Simoun is a traitor?

127
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:19,705
A traitor that you have trusted
for a long time.

128
00:07:21,974 --> 00:07:23,476
He is an impostor.

129
00:07:23,543 --> 00:07:27,146
He is an impostor, Captain General.

130
00:07:27,213 --> 00:07:33,920
Simoun is the heretic and
filibuster, Crisostomo Ibarra.

131
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,768
That's terrifying, Father.

132
00:07:48,835 --> 00:07:50,203
Crisostomo Ibarra?

133
00:07:51,604 --> 00:07:53,639
The educated man from San Diego?

134
00:07:53,706 --> 00:07:55,675
I'm sorry, but…

135
00:07:55,741 --> 00:07:58,778
the man you're talking about
has been dead for a long time.

136
00:07:59,345 --> 00:08:01,948
Friars, Captain General…

137
00:08:02,014 --> 00:08:04,650
what I'm saying is true.

138
00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:06,886
Here he is.

139
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:10,189
I read this from a book.

140
00:08:10,256 --> 00:08:11,624
It was written there.

141
00:08:13,526 --> 00:08:15,495
Your reverence…

142
00:08:15,561 --> 00:08:19,165
it seems like you've had wine
before coming here, Father.

143
00:08:21,467 --> 00:08:23,369
That's lunacy!

144
00:08:24,537 --> 00:08:26,205
What is this book you are talking about?

145
00:08:28,374 --> 00:08:30,576
Believe me.

146
00:08:30,643 --> 00:08:33,346
I read it from a mysterious book.

147
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:37,917
Where is the book?

148
00:08:45,091 --> 00:08:46,559
I lost it.

149
00:08:48,594 --> 00:08:54,033
It was stolen by a woman
who is a minion of the devil.

150
00:08:55,568 --> 00:08:56,869
But I read it.

151
00:08:56,936 --> 00:08:58,304
I read it.

152
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:00,640
Believe me. I read it.

153
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:04,777
We also hope to read this book.

154
00:09:04,844 --> 00:09:06,879
It's too bad.

155
00:09:06,946 --> 00:09:09,582
I also want to see my name in that novel.

156
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:13,252
Father Salvi,

157
00:09:13,986 --> 00:09:18,658
it's better for you to go back
to the convent to rest.

158
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:22,128
My guards will accompany you.

159
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:24,297
Gentlemen!

160
00:09:24,363 --> 00:09:27,066
Captain General, believe me.

161
00:09:27,133 --> 00:09:31,237
Simoun is not just
a heretic and a filibuster.

162
00:09:32,138 --> 00:09:33,940
He is a minion of Satan.

163
00:09:34,006 --> 00:09:34,974
Believe me.

164
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:36,576
I read this.

165
00:09:36,642 --> 00:09:38,244
It's true.

166
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:39,845
It's true.

167
00:09:41,113 --> 00:09:42,748
What was that?

168
00:09:42,815 --> 00:09:45,051
Stay here. Do not go out.

169
00:09:46,485 --> 00:09:47,820
I will check it myself.

170
00:10:10,509 --> 00:10:11,978
Check out what that was.

171
00:10:12,044 --> 00:10:14,146
-Quick!
-Yes, señor!

172
00:10:19,585 --> 00:10:21,454
Señor, come with us right now!

173
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,122
The carriage is waiting.

174
00:10:25,691 --> 00:10:27,660
Get out of here now.

175
00:10:27,727 --> 00:10:30,896
Señor, Klay is waiting for you.

176
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,069
And your friends, too.

177
00:10:41,073 --> 00:10:44,176
Please let's go.

178
00:10:44,243 --> 00:10:45,978
Hurry, señor. Please!

179
00:10:46,045 --> 00:10:48,114
Señor, let's go! Hurry.

180
00:11:10,236 --> 00:11:13,072
Were they responsible for
the commotion that happened earlier?

181
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:16,175
They just want to save you
from Father Salvi, señor.

182
00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:19,011
I can save myself.

183
00:11:22,415 --> 00:11:25,818
You said Ms. Klay is here?

184
00:11:33,826 --> 00:11:36,162
We already know your true identity.

185
00:11:40,733 --> 00:11:41,834
Sir.

186
00:11:47,306 --> 00:11:48,340
My friend,

187
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:51,377
is that really you?

188
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:10,062
Don't you like this kind of reunion?

189
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:13,966
You don't need to do this.

190
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:18,137
I don't need to escape
from the authorities.

191
00:12:19,605 --> 00:12:21,207
For the longest time,

192
00:12:22,641 --> 00:12:25,644
I've been facing them freely.

193
00:12:25,711 --> 00:12:26,946
Freely?

194
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:30,850
Do you think you're free?

195
00:12:31,851 --> 00:12:35,621
While under disguise?

196
00:12:35,688 --> 00:12:37,623
With a heart of stone?

197
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:04,283
Because I miss the Ibarra
that I have known before.

198
00:13:15,427 --> 00:13:17,830
The only thing missing is a big red hat.

199
00:13:17,897 --> 00:13:21,834
You're like the lead star
in a television drama about revenge.

200
00:13:26,505 --> 00:13:28,440
It's too late.

201
00:13:28,507 --> 00:13:30,109
We have already helped you escape.

202
00:13:33,112 --> 00:13:34,680
If you did not want to see us,

203
00:13:35,748 --> 00:13:37,483
then why did you come here?

204
00:13:40,853 --> 00:13:42,788
He's just pretending.

205
00:13:42,855 --> 00:13:44,290
I'm sure he missed us, too.

206
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:51,163
It's dangerous if we stay here.

207
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:56,535
For sure, the Captain General
already ordered to search this place.

208
00:13:56,602 --> 00:13:59,071
They must not see Señor Crisostomo.

209
00:14:00,906 --> 00:14:03,142
Señor Simoun is the one with us.

210
00:14:08,113 --> 00:14:09,982
I know a place where we can go.

211
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:12,651
It's just here in Tiani.

212
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:40,880
Simoun is the heretic and
the filibuster, Crisostomo Ibarra!

213
00:14:40,946 --> 00:14:44,350
It seems like you've had wine
before coming here, Father.

214
00:14:46,852 --> 00:14:53,058
<i>Oh God, if I cannot save this town
from Crisostomo Ibarra,</i>

215
00:14:58,831 --> 00:15:02,468
<i>I must first save the woman
whom I love the most.</i>

216
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:08,941
Crisostomo is alive?

217
00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:11,677
And he is Simoun?

218
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:17,116
He was poisoned.

219
00:15:18,183 --> 00:15:20,686
Is this a confession?

220
00:15:22,221 --> 00:15:25,057
And your plans have failed.

221
00:15:29,061 --> 00:15:32,398
<i>First, through the death of…</i>

222
00:15:38,237 --> 00:15:40,072
<i>Death of Maria?</i>

223
00:15:49,515 --> 00:15:50,349
The love of my life

224
00:15:52,351 --> 00:15:59,058
will die because of Ibarra.

225
00:16:18,177 --> 00:16:19,211
Basilio.

226
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:28,053
Señor.

227
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:39,465
Señor.

228
00:16:53,479 --> 00:16:54,546
Is that him?

229
00:16:55,647 --> 00:16:56,648
But…

230
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,255
Does the gentleman look familiar
to you too?

231
00:17:04,957 --> 00:17:06,558
No, it's nothing.

232
00:17:08,093 --> 00:17:09,928
I just remembered something about him

233
00:17:09,995 --> 00:17:11,997
when I was little.

234
00:17:12,064 --> 00:17:13,565
You are not safe here.

235
00:17:13,632 --> 00:17:14,967
So you better leave.

236
00:17:16,468 --> 00:17:17,436
Me too.

237
00:17:18,504 --> 00:17:20,906
My auntie treated a man before.

238
00:17:20,973 --> 00:17:22,741
We found him in the forest

239
00:17:22,808 --> 00:17:26,278
but I don't remember his name.

240
00:17:27,846 --> 00:17:29,815
Perhaps he did not say it.

241
00:17:33,485 --> 00:17:36,789
What is this book
you have been mentioning?'

242
00:17:50,769 --> 00:17:53,405
The <i>El Filibusterismo</i> by Jose Rizal.

243
00:18:00,612 --> 00:18:02,681
This seems to be a safe space.

244
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:07,086
And yes, you are also in it, Father.

245
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:15,561
But I hope it did not happen.

246
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:28,340
Whether you believe it or not,
you are all just characters in a story,

247
00:18:28,407 --> 00:18:29,508
in a novel.

248
00:18:31,677 --> 00:18:33,545
Here.

249
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:35,814
So even before I came back,

250
00:18:35,881 --> 00:18:40,219
I already knew it was you,
Crisostomo Ibarra,

251
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:43,455
despite how different you look

252
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:46,992
from the Sir Ibarra I know.

253
00:18:50,562 --> 00:18:51,897
Read it,

254
00:18:52,397 --> 00:18:54,600
so you will know I am telling the truth.

255
00:18:55,901 --> 00:18:57,836
Read it,

256
00:18:57,903 --> 00:18:59,004
so you will find out

257
00:18:59,071 --> 00:19:01,707
what other bad things
will happen to this country.

258
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:27,933
Amazing.

259
00:19:29,301 --> 00:19:32,938
There is something written here
about Cabeza Tales.

260
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:37,809
And there's also something
about you, Basilio.

261
00:19:41,413 --> 00:19:43,282
On chapter seven,

262
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:46,218
it's about Simoun.

263
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:51,857
Look at the 23rd chapter.

264
00:19:57,763 --> 00:19:59,031
A corpse.

265
00:20:00,265 --> 00:20:03,869
It is written there that Simoun
will urge Basilio

266
00:20:03,936 --> 00:20:06,438
to lead a revolt.

267
00:20:10,242 --> 00:20:13,145
Now you want a revolt?

268
00:20:15,747 --> 00:20:17,482
Yes, Elias.

269
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:18,784
But he will only do that

270
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:22,020
so that the monastery will be
forced to open its doors

271
00:20:22,087 --> 00:20:26,325
so Simoun can go inside
to save Maria Clara.

272
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:30,996
Is that why, that night at the graveyard,

273
00:20:32,264 --> 00:20:34,366
you urged me to revolt?

274
00:20:36,468 --> 00:20:38,337
Not for the country, but…

275
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:41,607
just for Señorita Maria Clara?

276
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:46,878
That's enough, Ms. Klay!

277
00:20:48,714 --> 00:20:52,251
Don't ruin my plans.

278
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:56,788
Your plans that can make
ordinary people's lives difficult.

279
00:20:58,223 --> 00:20:59,224
For what?

280
00:21:00,292 --> 00:21:03,028
To save your most beloved woman?

281
00:21:05,664 --> 00:21:07,332
Well, then let me tell you,

282
00:21:11,036 --> 00:21:14,673
Maria Clara will die in this story.

283
00:21:18,043 --> 00:21:19,478
That's enough!

284
00:21:47,873 --> 00:21:49,107
It's getting late.

285
00:21:51,243 --> 00:21:53,345
Let's let time pass…

286
00:21:55,414 --> 00:21:58,350
until daybreak.

287
00:22:00,385 --> 00:22:01,687
Let's all rest.

288
00:22:01,753 --> 00:22:02,888
I'm leaving.

289
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:09,428
I deeply regret that I met you again.

290
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:18,737
-Sir.
-Maria Clara will not die.

291
00:22:20,372 --> 00:22:21,873
I will not allow it.

292
00:22:23,141 --> 00:22:24,176
You're right.

293
00:22:26,278 --> 00:22:28,013
We will not allow it.

294
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:35,954
Listen to me carefully, Crisostomo Ibarra,

295
00:22:38,323 --> 00:22:39,324
Simoun.

296
00:22:46,264 --> 00:22:50,435
If we save Maria Clara right now,
we won't have any problems.

297
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:54,673
Maria Clara will not die
and you will not be resentful.

298
00:22:55,674 --> 00:22:57,743
You will not have to use Basilio, Isagani,

299
00:22:57,809 --> 00:23:00,812
and everyone they love
just for your revenge.

300
00:23:02,814 --> 00:23:04,816
If we act now,

301
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:12,924
we can still save her, Sir Ibarra.

302
00:23:16,361 --> 00:23:19,464
We can save the woman you love the most

303
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,069
and Maria Clara will not die.

304
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:34,446
No one should read the book anymore…

305
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:39,184
because what is written in that book

306
00:23:40,485 --> 00:23:42,621
will no longer happen.

307
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:48,693
We will save Maria Clara.

308
00:23:49,995 --> 00:23:51,329
This instant.

309
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:14,319
<i>Hail Mary, full of grace.</i>

310
00:24:14,386 --> 00:24:15,787
<i>The Lord is with thee.</i>

311
00:24:15,854 --> 00:24:17,088
<i>Blessed art thou amongst women,</i>

312
00:24:17,155 --> 00:24:18,890
<i>and blessed is the fruit</i>
<i>of thy womb, Jesus.</i>

313
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:22,093
<i>Holy Mary, Mother of God,</i>
<i>pray for us sinners,</i>

314
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,995
<i>now and at the hour</i> <i>of our death. Amen.</i>

315
00:24:30,602 --> 00:24:31,503
Martina.

316
00:24:33,004 --> 00:24:33,905
Martina?

317
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,442
I can eat in the dining room.

318
00:24:38,443 --> 00:24:40,745
Why did you bring me food here?

319
00:24:52,958 --> 00:24:58,063
Martina, did someone named Klay come by?

320
00:25:06,071 --> 00:25:09,908
It seems I have to find a way
so I can talk to her again.

321
00:25:13,478 --> 00:25:14,779
Please help me.

322
00:25:17,282 --> 00:25:18,884
Martina, please. Help me.

323
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,335
Martina, the key.

324
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:42,374
What are you doing here?

325
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,341
Thank you.

326
00:26:05,697 --> 00:26:10,468
Why do you have to bring me food
as if I'm sick or a prisoner?

327
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:15,040
Don't worry, Maria.

328
00:26:19,644 --> 00:26:21,146
I'm only making sure

329
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,649
that you are safe from danger,

330
00:26:27,152 --> 00:26:28,787
that no one can come here

331
00:26:29,688 --> 00:26:30,589
and take you away.

332
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:47,305
Why do you have the key?

333
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:51,009
Why do you have it?

334
00:27:05,056 --> 00:27:05,890
What's this?

335
00:27:07,192 --> 00:27:09,327
Father! Father, open the door!

336
00:27:09,394 --> 00:27:11,129
Martina, please!

337
00:27:11,196 --> 00:27:12,664
Open the door, Martina.

338
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:15,700
Help me!

339
00:27:16,368 --> 00:27:17,435
Help me!

340
00:27:18,403 --> 00:27:21,006
Open the door, please!

341
00:27:21,072 --> 00:27:23,742
Please! Help me, please!

342
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:29,981
May God bless their plans,
whatever those may be.

343
00:27:32,384 --> 00:27:34,386
I still can't believe
what happened yesterday.

344
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:36,621
Can you believe it?

345
00:27:39,858 --> 00:27:43,328
There's no time like today to say,

346
00:27:44,129 --> 00:27:47,265
"Vanity of vanities, all is vanity."

347
00:27:48,266 --> 00:27:50,168
Oh, San Juan Crisostomo.

348
00:27:52,437 --> 00:27:53,638
Well, I'll go ahead.

349
00:27:53,705 --> 00:27:55,373
I still have to prepare for the mass.

350
00:27:56,107 --> 00:27:57,075
Just come after.

351
00:27:57,609 --> 00:27:58,443
I'll go ahead.

352
00:27:58,510 --> 00:27:59,711
Goodbye, Uncle.

353
00:27:59,778 --> 00:28:00,845
Take care, Father.

354
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:06,384
So?

355
00:28:06,451 --> 00:28:07,986
Don't you want to at least take a peek?

356
00:28:08,053 --> 00:28:09,654
I can't even bring myself to hold it.

357
00:28:10,488 --> 00:28:11,423
How can I take a peek?

358
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:16,795
Klay entrusted me to keep this safe.

359
00:28:20,598 --> 00:28:22,500
But why did she ask you to keep it?

360
00:28:24,602 --> 00:28:25,503
Basilio,

361
00:28:26,137 --> 00:28:27,205
I just want to see it.

362
00:28:28,106 --> 00:28:29,040
Please, my friend.

363
00:28:44,789 --> 00:28:47,292
It's dangerous, Isagani.

364
00:28:47,358 --> 00:28:49,828
She asked me to keep it because
it would be dangerous

365
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:51,963
if they lose it while
they are on the move.

366
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:54,632
Or while they are saving
Señorita Maria Clara.

367
00:28:56,301 --> 00:28:59,070
This book might end up getting
into the wrong hands.

368
00:28:59,771 --> 00:29:02,273
Klay said that she will take it
from me when they get back.

369
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:05,310
A mysterious book that is like

370
00:29:06,111 --> 00:29:08,546
a wheel of fortune.

371
00:29:13,451 --> 00:29:14,886
It's such a mystery

372
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:19,290
that we are just characters in a novel.

373
00:29:20,492 --> 00:29:22,327
What else could be written in that book

374
00:29:24,229 --> 00:29:25,163
that is yet to happen?

375
00:29:26,931 --> 00:29:28,099
I'm not yet ready to find out.

376
00:29:31,336 --> 00:29:33,605
I don't want to entertain these mysteries.

377
00:29:36,007 --> 00:29:37,342
My friend,

378
00:29:37,842 --> 00:29:39,544
don't you want to take a peek?

379
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:41,813
Let's go home, Isagani.

380
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:44,949
I will keep this book in a safe place.

381
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:50,588
Who knows what we might end up
doing to this book?

382
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:54,626
Let's go.

383
00:29:54,692 --> 00:29:55,527
All right.

384
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:01,699
The civil guards
you sent here have arrived.

385
00:30:05,069 --> 00:30:06,271
Father,

386
00:30:07,238 --> 00:30:10,775
do we really need such tight security
in the monastery?

387
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:13,912
Maria and I need protection.

388
00:30:16,714 --> 00:30:18,483
We all need protection,

389
00:30:20,285 --> 00:30:26,191
especially now that there are bandits
abducting nuns and friars.

390
00:30:27,458 --> 00:30:28,493
For God's sake.

391
00:30:30,461 --> 00:30:31,896
How is Maria doing?

392
00:30:32,597 --> 00:30:35,033
We have yet to visit her, Father.

393
00:30:35,733 --> 00:30:37,802
ever since you locked her door.

394
00:30:39,237 --> 00:30:41,139
But the servants said

395
00:30:41,206 --> 00:30:44,309
she kept demanding
to be released from her room.

396
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:47,812
I am worried about Maria, Father.

397
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,682
Does Maria know?

398
00:30:52,116 --> 00:30:53,618
Know what, Father?

399
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:56,988
It is the right decision
to keep her inside her room.

400
00:30:57,989 --> 00:31:01,392
If the goal is to keep
the monastery protected,

401
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:05,063
why is her room the only one locked?

402
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:10,301
Does this mean that Maria
will not be allowed in the prayer room?

403
00:31:12,303 --> 00:31:15,540
Are you questioning my orders, sister?

404
00:31:17,442 --> 00:31:18,343
No, Father.

405
00:31:20,011 --> 00:31:20,879
Forgive me.

406
00:31:42,967 --> 00:31:44,702
Is there anything I can help you with?

407
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:47,472
Good afternoon!

408
00:31:47,538 --> 00:31:52,443
I am Mister Albino de los Reyes
y Infantes.

409
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:56,681
I wish for my daughter,
Narcisa, to become a nun.

410
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:59,884
Is your mother superior here?

411
00:32:00,885 --> 00:32:04,389
Martina, you may take them
to Sister Teresa's office.

412
00:32:13,331 --> 00:32:14,465
Get out of here.

413
00:32:14,532 --> 00:32:16,034
-Get out of here!
-Ouch!

414
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:20,071
If not, I will take you
to prison right now.

415
00:32:20,138 --> 00:32:21,973
Fine, I'm going!

416
00:32:23,574 --> 00:32:24,943
You can stop pretending.

417
00:32:45,029 --> 00:32:46,297
I brought you milk.

418
00:32:49,067 --> 00:32:52,070
You need to drink this
so you will be healthy.

419
00:33:01,145 --> 00:33:02,080
Please.

420
00:33:03,848 --> 00:33:05,149
You poor thing.

421
00:33:06,551 --> 00:33:08,353
Drink what I'm offering.

422
00:33:16,027 --> 00:33:17,261
That is not what I want.

423
00:33:34,779 --> 00:33:36,447
Don't make me force you to drink this.

424
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:50,661
For God's sake.

425
00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:00,972
When I say no, I mean no!

426
00:34:06,677 --> 00:34:08,112
You are so ungrateful.

427
00:34:11,282 --> 00:34:14,085
Why does the door have
to be locked, Father?

428
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:17,388
Tell me the truth!

429
00:34:20,925 --> 00:34:22,527
Why do you lock me up here?

430
00:34:36,007 --> 00:34:37,475
Didn't I already tell you…

431
00:34:40,812 --> 00:34:42,914
that I need to protect you?

432
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:50,421
What else do you need?

433
00:34:53,391 --> 00:34:55,493
What more do you want, Maria?

434
00:34:58,963 --> 00:35:01,332
I just want to remind you, Father,

435
00:35:07,505 --> 00:35:09,373
that I despise you.

436
00:35:25,356 --> 00:35:26,557
And who is it

437
00:35:27,859 --> 00:35:30,161
that you do not despise?

438
00:35:30,928 --> 00:35:32,096
Let go of me.

439
00:35:32,697 --> 00:35:33,831
Who?

440
00:35:34,398 --> 00:35:37,635
The man that you love? Crisostomo Ibarra?

441
00:35:40,738 --> 00:35:42,206
Because of him,

442
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:48,613
you cannot give me

443
00:35:51,382 --> 00:35:52,817
even just a tiny bit,

444
00:35:54,685 --> 00:35:58,422
even just a tiny bit of your love.

445
00:36:02,393 --> 00:36:03,494
Speak.

446
00:36:05,396 --> 00:36:06,631
Speak.

447
00:36:08,633 --> 00:36:09,834
Speak, Maria.

448
00:36:10,735 --> 00:36:12,036
Let go of me.

449
00:36:13,404 --> 00:36:15,540
Let go of me!

450
00:36:20,211 --> 00:36:21,212
I know you, miss.

451
00:36:22,647 --> 00:36:24,081
You are Ms. Klay.

452
00:36:25,983 --> 00:36:28,186
Sister Maria has been waiting for you.

453
00:36:29,687 --> 00:36:31,189
I will help you.

454
00:36:31,989 --> 00:36:32,823
Where is she?

455
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:43,134
For more than a decade,

456
00:36:45,736 --> 00:36:48,306
I have been trying to control myself

457
00:36:49,273 --> 00:36:50,341
because of you, Maria.

458
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:53,945
I have been giving you everything you want

459
00:36:54,011 --> 00:36:56,047
for a decade now.

460
00:36:58,983 --> 00:37:00,017
But even now,

461
00:37:03,788 --> 00:37:04,655
even now,

462
00:37:11,028 --> 00:37:12,663
you still disregard it.

463
00:37:16,667 --> 00:37:17,935
And you keep ignoring

464
00:37:20,204 --> 00:37:22,173
my love for you.

465
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:29,947
Because even now,

466
00:37:34,352 --> 00:37:35,386
even now,

467
00:37:36,687 --> 00:37:38,889
it's still Crisostomo.

468
00:37:40,358 --> 00:37:42,059
It's still Crisostomo!

469
00:37:45,663 --> 00:37:46,497
It's still him.

470
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:51,469
He's still my rival.

471
00:37:54,805 --> 00:37:57,708
Why can't you forget him?

472
00:37:58,976 --> 00:37:59,944
Why?

473
00:38:03,381 --> 00:38:07,585
Because Crisostomo is the only one
who makes my heart beat.

474
00:38:13,324 --> 00:38:19,030
Because he's the only one who
gives me a reason to live.

475
00:38:22,767 --> 00:38:24,568
And because he will come back for me.

476
00:38:30,775 --> 00:38:31,642
Maria.

477
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:39,050
Maria, forgive me. Forgive me, please.

478
00:38:56,434 --> 00:39:01,439
Love me instead, Maria.

479
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:04,108
-Let go of me, you animal!
-Only me.

480
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:05,176
Only me.

481
00:39:11,782 --> 00:39:13,417
Stay here with me.

482
00:39:13,484 --> 00:39:15,219
Don't leave.

483
00:39:15,286 --> 00:39:17,655
Don't leave. Stay here with me.

484
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:51,455
You are mine.

485
00:39:51,522 --> 00:39:53,023
I am the only one you will love.

486
00:39:55,726 --> 00:39:56,827
Do you understand?

487
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:00,831
-Let me go!
-It should be me.

488
00:40:13,344 --> 00:40:16,981
Someone will die here
if you continue this.

489
00:40:19,817 --> 00:40:20,818
Is death

490
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,555
your only threat?

491
00:40:26,524 --> 00:40:29,193
It seems that life is really short.

492
00:40:31,462 --> 00:40:32,363
Alright, then.

493
00:40:34,031 --> 00:40:35,499
We don't have time.

494
00:40:41,739 --> 00:40:42,773
Come with me.

495
00:40:44,842 --> 00:40:45,676
Come with me.

496
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:49,146
Adelina, what is it?

497
00:40:50,748 --> 00:40:51,582
What?

498
00:40:52,383 --> 00:40:53,217
What is happening?

499
00:40:55,386 --> 00:40:56,253
What?

500
00:40:57,087 --> 00:40:58,422
Is it Maria?

501
00:40:58,489 --> 00:40:59,356
It's Maria.

502
00:40:59,423 --> 00:41:00,825
Come on.

503
00:41:36,126 --> 00:41:37,194
Help!

504
00:41:38,262 --> 00:41:39,563
Maria!

505
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:41,298
-Father, what did you do?
-You animal!

506
00:41:43,434 --> 00:41:44,768
Ouch!

507
00:41:44,835 --> 00:41:46,136
Fools!

508
00:41:46,203 --> 00:41:47,071
Enough of this!

509
00:41:47,137 --> 00:41:48,572
Enough of this, you fools!

510
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:50,708
Enough of this!

511
00:41:51,408 --> 00:41:52,243
You witches!

512
00:41:53,043 --> 00:41:54,545
Ouch! You are hurting me!

513
00:41:54,612 --> 00:41:57,414
You animal! You are really shameless!

514
00:41:57,481 --> 00:41:58,549
-Enough!
-You animal!

515
00:41:58,616 --> 00:42:01,085
You animal!

516
00:42:04,688 --> 00:42:05,990
You animal!

517
00:42:06,056 --> 00:42:08,459
You animal!

518
00:42:09,326 --> 00:42:10,160
Go on.

519
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:12,029
Go on.

520
00:42:12,563 --> 00:42:13,731
Go on.

521
00:42:17,668 --> 00:42:18,569
If you don't stop,

522
00:42:19,570 --> 00:42:25,709
this witch's life will come to an end.

523
00:42:27,945 --> 00:42:29,613
Don't you ever hurt Klay!

524
00:42:30,347 --> 00:42:32,683
Don't ever hurt her, you animal!

525
00:42:40,090 --> 00:42:40,925
Father?

526
00:42:44,428 --> 00:42:45,596
Good thing you arrived.

527
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:52,670
I chanced upon this strange woman here
in Maria's room.

528
00:42:54,004 --> 00:42:57,341
These servants are her accomplices.

529
00:43:00,644 --> 00:43:02,346
Arrest these women.

530
00:43:05,616 --> 00:43:07,184
We are arresting you, Father.

531
00:43:08,519 --> 00:43:09,420
Why are you…

532
00:43:12,823 --> 00:43:13,857
Let me go.

533
00:43:13,924 --> 00:43:14,858
Let's go, Father.

534
00:43:14,925 --> 00:43:16,293
Let me go.

535
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:17,995
-Prepare for your…
-Let me go!

536
00:43:22,232 --> 00:43:23,500
Let's go.

537
00:43:23,567 --> 00:43:26,070
-Let me go.
-Let's go!

538
00:43:26,136 --> 00:43:27,304
-Let me go!
-Let's go!

539
00:43:27,371 --> 00:43:28,339
Stupid!

540
00:43:28,973 --> 00:43:29,840
Fools!

541
00:43:33,210 --> 00:43:36,046
We will just check
if the other nuns are safe.

542
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:38,949
Come on, come on!

543
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:53,297
Klay.

544
00:44:00,704 --> 00:44:01,572
Maria.

545
00:44:04,208 --> 00:44:05,743
What did he do to you?

546
00:44:07,144 --> 00:44:08,612
Were we too late?

547
00:44:12,416 --> 00:44:14,685
Don't worry about what happened.

548
00:44:15,953 --> 00:44:18,255
That will never happen again.

549
00:44:23,694 --> 00:44:26,730
Your namesake stood her ground.

550
00:44:30,801 --> 00:44:32,336
Thank you for coming back.

551
00:44:41,779 --> 00:44:42,846
Come on, my namesake.

552
00:44:43,547 --> 00:44:45,282
I told you, right?

553
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:47,317
I will never forget about you.

554
00:44:48,852 --> 00:44:50,521
I came back

555
00:44:51,822 --> 00:44:53,290
to change the story.

556
00:44:58,829 --> 00:45:00,497
After so many years,

557
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:04,735
you are still saying the same thing.

558
00:45:07,271 --> 00:45:08,105
The story.

559
00:45:11,108 --> 00:45:12,576
Because that's what I will do.

560
00:45:14,411 --> 00:45:17,648
Especially your happy ending with Sir.

561
00:46:11,602 --> 00:46:15,038
Let me go! You have no shame!

562
00:46:15,105 --> 00:46:16,440
COMING UP

563
00:46:18,542 --> 00:46:20,677
Don't you want to take a peek?

564
00:46:31,555 --> 00:46:33,357
I wonder what else is written in that book

565
00:46:34,224 --> 00:46:35,526
that has yet to happen.

566
00:46:44,134 --> 00:46:46,603
